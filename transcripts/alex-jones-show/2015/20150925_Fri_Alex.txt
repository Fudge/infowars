[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:04.211]  You are watching the InfoWars Nightly News, which airs 7 p.m.
[00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.732]  Central at InfoWarsNews.com.
[00:00:06.852 --> 00:00:10.334]  And your support is helping us defend liberty worldwide.
[00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.854]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:22.295]  You want answers?
[00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:23.977]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:28.281]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:32.885]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:47.676]  Well, I got up this morning to some happy tidings.
[00:00:48.496 --> 00:01:02.119]  John Boehner, the Supreme Rhino, the man who's been blocking the repeal of partial birth abortion, the man who's been blocking the repeal of Obamacare, is going to resign in October.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.501]  It was Congressman Walter Jones in the last year that really launched the move to organize
[00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.610]  A movement to remove Boehner from the Speakership.
[00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.611]  He was on with us about a month ago.
[00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:23.773]  They moved in the House to try to block a vote to remove Boehner or to call for a leadership change.
[00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:26.934]  And they learned they didn't have the votes, so they had to stand down.
[00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:33.016]  Since then, there have been major movements beneath the surface of the waters to remove him.
[00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:44.140]  So believe me, you're going to get the absolute inside baseball coming up in the second hour with Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina, a true patriot.
[00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:54.225]  He's also trying to release the 28 pages of the 9-11 report showing that Saudi Arabia quarterbacked the attacks bare minimum.
[00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:56.906]  That's why Infowars is so important.
[00:01:56.926 --> 00:01:59.127]  We broke the Benghazi Stinger missile story first.
[00:01:59.943 --> 00:02:11.249]  We've been a spearhead on countless other issues and the system is afraid of us because we can push a story that isn't getting attention into the mainstream.
[00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:20.595]  And it's been my job to try to get other people up and running and other organizations up and running so that we're not the only organization that can effectively do this.
[00:02:21.095 --> 00:02:28.079]  Obviously out of self-preservation, but more importantly out of the fact that we need more people aware of what's happening and taking action.
[00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:42.341]  And that's why I put out a video that I taped last night at like 8 o'clock at night, that we launched this morning, that's on Infowars.com, red-linked, Obama plans to shut down news organization.
[00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:49.247]  Now they tried to shut down News Corp, they tried to shut down Rush Limbaugh, I mean they had him arrested for Viagra.
[00:02:50.029 --> 00:03:08.216]  Remember, and I'm not a total fan of Limbaugh, and Limbaugh's for the police state, even though it's attacked him, and I'm up against Limbaugh and all the rest of it, but I don't have fantasies that if Limbaugh had a heart attack or if Limbaugh was arrested, I'd be filling his shoes, because there's all these idiots out there that go, if we bring down Alex Jones, we'll get his audience.
[00:03:08.896 --> 00:03:10.477]  No, it'll dissipate, fools.
[00:03:13.558 --> 00:03:14.378]  It's just crazy.
[00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.120]  But if we don't hang together, we hang separate, to quote Benjamin Franklin,
[00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:23.246]  I said support Rush Limbaugh when he was under attack and when he was being boycotted.
[00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:28.448]  I said, don't let Obama indict News Corp for the hacking scandal.
[00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:34.830]  Because whether it happened or not, this White House is so criminal, it's trying to shut down the free press.
[00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.012]  And if they can take down Limbaugh, or they can take down Rupert Murdoch, they can take down anybody.
[00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:46.554]  Dinesh D'Souza got thrown in prison for nine months for doing something that wasn't even illegal, if you look at the statutes.
[00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.583]  They have indicted the Texas Attorney General who was fighting Obama.
[00:03:52.323 --> 00:03:54.044]  The word is they're investigating the governor.
[00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:59.127]  And I have that from the highest levels.
[00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:01.048]  The governor's followed around everywhere.
[00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:03.410]  They're digging through Abbott's garbage.
[00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.012]  This isn't a game.
[00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:08.693]  There is a war on the press.
[00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:09.633]  It's unprecedented.
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:20.064]  I had an FBI source over a year ago, and another one as well that was more of an informant threatening me on a separate issue.
[00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:27.787]  But an FBI source inside, and you know we get all these documents, MIAC, Homeland Security, I mean we really get these, we're willing to put them out.
[00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:29.188]  Other folks get them too, they're just too scared.
[00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:35.000]  And they said, listen, I don't know what's going on, but you are under major surveillance.
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.781]  And the Feds have been told, dig something up on you.
[00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:39.441]  And so you're being given this warning.
[00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:44.564]  And I know you don't think you're doing anything wrong, but man, don't speed and, you know, just watch your butt.
[00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:50.086]  Well, they couldn't dig anything up.
[00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:52.327]  They thought it'd be too political.
[00:04:52.407 --> 00:04:54.728]  So then they went to the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:04:57.066 --> 00:05:05.677]  And they went to other commissions to have them dig in, and that's what they've been doing, is running around with white gloves, trying to find something to come after us.
[00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:07.740]  And hey, obviously we've hit the big time.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.242]  It's a great badge of honor.
[00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:11.856]  You've heard of Clock Kid, right?
[00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:16.697]  The boy who removed the insides of a digital clock, put it in a suitcase, then brought it to school to show his teachers.
[00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:22.039]  When people got suspicious, he claimed he didn't know anything, refused to talk to police, then gets invited to the White House.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.920]  Well, get ready.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.721]  Now we have Pope Kid.
[00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:25.381]  That's right.
[00:05:25.521 --> 00:05:33.404]  The Daily Mail reports five-year-old daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope after breaking through security barricades hours after he says mass in Spanish.
[00:05:33.664 --> 00:05:37.405]  Sofia Cruz was part of a crowd of thousands lining the paparazzi in Washington, D.C.
[00:05:37.445 --> 00:05:38.666]  to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.
[00:05:38.906 --> 00:05:43.590]  As he passed, she got over police barricades and ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the Pope-mobile.
[00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.193]  She happened to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that read, Pope Rescue DAPA.
[00:05:47.353 --> 00:05:49.255]  So the legalization would be your blessing.
[00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:52.958]  Makes you wonder, with all this security theater around, how a five-year-old could get through.
[00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:55.039]  Hmm, maybe it's staged.
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.422]  Of course every five-year-old's got a letter ready and a t-shirt printed up.
[00:05:58.582 --> 00:05:59.723]  Nothing weird about that.
[00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:00.804]  Back to the clock kid.
[00:06:00.864 --> 00:06:04.507]  Did you know his sister was suspended for reportedly threatening to blow up the school?
[00:06:04.727 --> 00:06:06.549]  Hmm, now it all becomes clearer.
[00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.012]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:10.472 --> 00:06:15.497]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:06:15.637 --> 00:06:21.503]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:06:21.743 --> 00:06:26.347]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:06:26.527 --> 00:06:29.890]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.672]  No needles, no injections.
[00:06:32.072 --> 00:06:38.398]  Secure your Revolutionary Secret 12 Formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:44.683]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems.
[00:06:44.824 --> 00:06:48.807]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[00:06:48.987 --> 00:06:52.010]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms
[00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.571]  We're good.
[00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:19.153]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:27.457]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:27.617 --> 00:07:32.319]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:36.161]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:38.182]  We're good to go.
[00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:07.500]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.341]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:18.826]  You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future.
[00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:21.907]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[00:08:23.048 --> 00:08:23.948]  This is not a new world.
[00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:28.538]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:37.182]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:08:38.103 --> 00:08:45.046]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:08:46.187 --> 00:08:50.769]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.131]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:08:59.492 --> 00:09:01.333]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[00:09:02.214 --> 00:09:07.877]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:10.439]  Because he's built out of flesh.
[00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:12.460]  And because he has a mind.
[00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:19.284]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:24.488]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:09:24.608 --> 00:09:26.629]  It is the Friday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:09:27.878 --> 00:09:30.240]  The 25th day of September 2015.
[00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:36.346]  I, of course, will return this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:38.128]  I will be hosting the Sunday transmission.
[00:09:38.448 --> 00:09:45.856]  David Knight and Jakari Jackson will be reporting from New York City today, in the third hour, and joining me Sunday as well.
[00:09:46.677 --> 00:09:51.341]  We have Congressman Walter Jones, who spearheaded the movement, to have John Boehner step down.
[00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:55.808]  People lost their committee memberships, their committee chairmanships.
[00:09:55.948 --> 00:09:56.768]  They were targeted.
[00:09:56.788 --> 00:10:01.229]  Election money, war chests were piled up to remove them from office.
[00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:13.191]  But Walter Jones of North Carolina led the charge and will be giving us the inside scoop on why Boehner announced this morning that he will be resigning from Congress in October.
[00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:21.013]  Congressman Jones was on with us one month ago this week, one month ago Wednesday.
[00:10:21.033 --> 00:10:21.613]  So 32 days ago.
[00:10:23.783 --> 00:10:27.424]  And he broke down the fact that they had the votes to get it out of committee.
[00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:34.166]  They were going to try to move to have a vote to block it, but Boehner didn't have the votes and so didn't know what to do.
[00:10:35.586 --> 00:10:44.288]  Well, now the word is, you'll get it directly from Congressman Jones, is they had the votes, they were going to move next week to remove him.
[00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:48.069]  This is another devastating victory against the Globalist.
[00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:50.870]  The fight now goes to who will
[00:10:51.874 --> 00:11:01.982]  Go in the Ascension of the Speakership, if the neocons and the rhinos will be able to block the Tea Party rebellion that the Democrats and Republicans have combined forces together to block.
[00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:06.586]  That's why the Tea Party has been audited, indicted, harassed.
[00:11:06.686 --> 00:11:11.269]  That's why military veteran organizations have been harassed.
[00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.810]  It's why
[00:11:13.732 --> 00:11:31.383]  Anyone who is a basic classic American has been under attack is because they know we're popular, they know we have the cure to globalist tyranny, they know that we can bring this country back to greatness, and the globalists are moving on every front to finish this country and Europe once and for all.
[00:11:31.944 --> 00:11:33.625]  So the great battle has now been joined.
[00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:38.812]  Many people just want to go through life and be left alone.
[00:11:39.552 --> 00:11:44.476]  Many people don't have confidence in themselves, so even if they're being bullied, they'll put up with it.
[00:11:46.258 --> 00:12:00.569]  I caught myself this morning, after I did some elliptical lifting weights, absolutely enthusiastic and happy and proud of myself and satisfied to a degree that I have never been.
[00:12:00.589 --> 00:12:02.871]  I felt
[00:12:05.583 --> 00:12:18.288]  So manly, so honorable, so good, that my conscience was giving me a type of energy I've never felt in my life.
[00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:35.075]  Because when I got some of the news in the last year, and more news yesterday confirming it, that there's a major FBI white collar crime task force directly under Obama and the Justice Department, the Attorney General, with
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:44.123]  Upwards of 20 people working 15 hours a day to find out some way to put me in prison and to shut down InfoWars.
[00:12:45.984 --> 00:12:51.406]  I wasn't scared when I confirmed it, but I still was upset by it and my mind was working.
[00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:53.566]  I didn't lose any sleep about it.
[00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:58.648]  And then this morning, I was just thinking about all the innocents being chopped up, all the babies.
[00:12:59.008 --> 00:13:02.810]  I was thinking about the globalists destabilizing all these countries, the fluoride in the water.
[00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:13.230]  The cancer viruses and the vaccines and how they want to keep their war quiet, underground, their geoengineering, basically invisible.
[00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:17.653]  They want to carry out their operation with everybody just in a trance.
[00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:26.237]  And the mere fact that we reach over a billion people a month via social networks, we have that from Google's own analytics.
[00:13:26.277 --> 00:13:29.959]  We actually show it in the video that's on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:32.301]  Obama plans to shut down news organization.
[00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:45.805]  The fact that we reach hundreds of millions of people every month on different video platforms, a million people a day on a podcast, five million people a day now on radio, I mean, it really is massive.
[00:13:46.145 --> 00:13:47.886]  And the globalists already know it's massive.
[00:13:49.987 --> 00:13:58.832]  And I knew launching a TV network that's going to grow slowly and just be a new avenue in their dinosaur brains would really freak them out and scare them, and it certainly has.
[00:14:01.846 --> 00:14:19.726]  But thinking about my forebearers, thinking about the founding fathers, thinking about the founders of Texas, thinking about my ancestors in England and the things they did, I just really in my gut, in my spirit, understood that I was beginning to approach the stairs to their ranks.
[00:14:21.788 --> 00:14:23.250]  And that's the most valuable thing in the world.
[00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:31.056]  It isn't fancy cars or big houses or hot tubs or Caribbean beaches that matter in the final equation.
[00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:32.597]  It is being honorable.
[00:14:33.057 --> 00:14:34.498]  It is standing up for what's right.
[00:14:34.878 --> 00:14:36.099]  It's being a good person.
[00:14:37.479 --> 00:14:41.182]  And it is upholding your family name.
[00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:45.304]  And I can truly be proud of what I've done.
[00:14:45.644 --> 00:14:46.745]  Not on some power trip.
[00:14:46.805 --> 00:14:47.685]  Not in an arrogant way.
[00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:49.827]  I've always felt like I haven't done enough.
[00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:53.213]  I've always felt like I haven't gone far enough.
[00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:56.434]  And if you notice, I've turned the heat up as of late.
[00:14:56.494 --> 00:15:08.058]  I've really gotten aggressive and really said what I think and gone to a whole other level of aggressiveness because I knew in my gut that that was the right thing to do.
[00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:14.781]  And my gut, my spirit, said right back to my conscious mind, yes, now you're lined up with God.
[00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:17.362]  Now you're doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:15:19.235 --> 00:15:21.778]  And with that, it will draw down the fire of the enemy.
[00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:23.860]  But that is expected.
[00:15:25.762 --> 00:15:26.963]  We're losing everything.
[00:15:27.324 --> 00:15:28.625]  We're becoming enslaved.
[00:15:28.665 --> 00:15:30.347]  We're becoming soulless.
[00:15:34.531 --> 00:15:37.334]  Because we have been intimidated.
[00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:39.016]  We have been cowed.
[00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:40.618]  We have been trained to cower.
[00:15:41.997 --> 00:15:55.403]  On our knees, on our bellies, licking the boots of the system, and then we see the arrogance, the craziness, the chutzpah, the bravado, the hubris of the elite, and it's just mind-blowing.
[00:15:55.683 --> 00:15:58.044]  Hillary Clinton looks like a breeze would blow her over.
[00:15:58.444 --> 00:16:02.206]  Janet Yellen's having many strokes on TV and can hardly talk.
[00:16:02.706 --> 00:16:05.628]  We're simply ruled by piles of trash.
[00:16:06.368 --> 00:16:13.290]  Because we've given in to fear of them, and the black uniforms, and the jackboots, and all the rest of it.
[00:16:15.031 --> 00:16:16.892]  And I can really say, I am free.
[00:16:17.932 --> 00:16:32.217]  I knew when I crossed the threshold, bullhorning Bilderberg, in 2006, and they sent Richard Holbrook out, when I did it, I could feel I was passing a line to another level.
[00:16:33.932 --> 00:17:00.006]  of opportunity for freedom but also danger and I loved every minute of it and I've passed other lines as well but launching a TV network that'll take years to grow is only a sign to them to remind them of the indomitable human spirit that refuses to submit it only reminds them of human empowerment and empowered individuals and the fact that
[00:17:00.566 --> 00:17:02.587]  We don't cower in fear to the system.
[00:17:02.847 --> 00:17:03.928]  They can't stand that.
[00:17:04.248 --> 00:17:09.411]  And so they know full well, if word gets to me of what's going on, I'll come on air and talk about it.
[00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:17.715]  And they think you're cowards and that you're then going to roll over in fear and not become involved because, oh my gosh, the big bad government might come get you.
[00:17:17.795 --> 00:17:18.736]  Let me explain something.
[00:17:20.011 --> 00:17:23.392]  We've gone from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 58 with autism.
[00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:27.774]  The CDC's saying by 2025, 1 in 3, maybe 1 in 2.
[00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:29.515]  They already came for us.
[00:17:29.735 --> 00:17:30.736]  They came for our kids.
[00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.817]  They already killed 55 million babies.
[00:17:32.857 --> 00:17:35.438]  They already keep them alive and sell their organs.
[00:17:36.218 --> 00:17:37.198]  They already came for us.
[00:17:37.579 --> 00:17:39.579]  They've been putting fluoride in the water for 60 years.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.020]  Massive IQ reductions.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.281]  Massive cancer increases.
[00:17:42.541 --> 00:17:43.481]  Harvard even admits it.
[00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:44.542]  They already came for us.
[00:17:44.982 --> 00:17:53.345]  We already got pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, cancer of the bladder, cancer of the kidneys up multi-thousand percent.
[00:17:53.525 --> 00:17:54.546]  They already came for us.
[00:17:56.118 --> 00:18:03.643]  They already drove down our wages, shut off our power plants, got rid of our jobs, destroyed our culture, and now we're on the news again.
[00:18:04.163 --> 00:18:08.425]  This time mainstream British newspapers legitimizing pedophilia yesterday.
[00:18:09.066 --> 00:18:12.648]  They're promoting pedophilia on TV as if it's good.
[00:18:13.088 --> 00:18:14.249]  They already came, folks.
[00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:15.049]  They already got us.
[00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.330]  We're already slaves.
[00:18:19.872 --> 00:18:22.014]  And my very cells
[00:18:23.612 --> 00:18:25.913]  My cells cannot go along with this.
[00:18:26.113 --> 00:18:28.334]  I am a slave to standing up to tyranny.
[00:18:29.134 --> 00:18:30.415]  I'm a slave to conscience.
[00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:34.016]  I'm a slave to Jesus Christ, but I chose to be.
[00:18:36.137 --> 00:18:39.378]  You people that are slaves to evil, I don't even know what planet you think you're living on.
[00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:42.140]  What a pathetic God you serve, you cowards.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.341]  You think you're being given power on this planet to carry out evil?
[00:18:46.761 --> 00:18:50.343]  You will pay in this life, and you will pay in the next.
[00:18:55.776 --> 00:18:58.857]  You don't have to believe in God to know when you do bad stuff, it comes back on you.
[00:19:01.879 --> 00:19:06.981]  And so at the bottom of the hour, I'll play the report I'm talking about that I shot in one piece, unedited.
[00:19:07.001 --> 00:19:10.663]  They put some articles over it just to document what I'm talking about.
[00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:14.605]  But I tell you, it is Kafkaesque.
[00:19:14.745 --> 00:19:15.725]  It is 1984.
[00:19:16.545 --> 00:19:24.009]  When you sit there on your couch after your kids have gone to bed for like an hour, staring out into the starlit sky through the window,
[00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:30.299]  And you cannot think of anything you've done illegal, other than speeding.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.120]  Other than drinking two beers and driving.
[00:19:35.021 --> 00:19:42.784]  And you can't think of anything you've done, and then you realize, this government's so criminal and so wicked and so bad, they frame people on record.
[00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:44.125]  It doesn't matter.
[00:19:45.005 --> 00:19:48.967]  And it doesn't make me feel scared or bad, it makes me feel sad for this country.
[00:19:49.527 --> 00:19:53.869]  That we're such a despicably corrupt, wicked, devilish nation.
[00:19:55.771 --> 00:20:03.334]  And that we are ruled by criminals that are openly waging war on the press in front of everyone and getting away with it.
[00:20:04.115 --> 00:20:05.395]  Imagine what comes next.
[00:20:06.315 --> 00:20:09.957]  Well, more bondage, more sickness, more pain.
[00:20:10.962 --> 00:20:15.204]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[00:20:15.384 --> 00:20:19.286]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[00:20:19.446 --> 00:20:26.630]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.833]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:32.053 --> 00:20:39.997]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:24:14.398 --> 00:24:15.719]  This is not America.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.462]  A little piece of you, a little piece of me dies.
[00:24:31.005 --> 00:24:33.027]  Look at this new shock poll.
[00:24:33.047 --> 00:24:40.193]  62% of Republicans feel betrayed by their party.
[00:24:40.273 --> 00:24:45.637]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:24:45.918 --> 00:24:48.580]  It's a Fox News poll.
[00:25:00.376 --> 00:25:18.170]  That's why the entire Republican leadership with the Democrats and the National Chamber of Commerce are giving more money to defeat Tea Party candidates in the last election and the upcoming election than the parties are donating to fight each other.
[00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.910]  Look it up.
[00:25:21.912 --> 00:25:28.658]  That's why they're indicting Tea Party governors and Tea Party attorney generals and Tea Party filmmakers
[00:25:29.864 --> 00:25:39.668]  I don't agree with Michael Moore's politics, but if they set him up politically and arrested him for some little chicken stuff, I would defend Michael Moore vehemently.
[00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:49.652]  Not a word from him about Dinesh D'Souza being thrown in prison for getting five friends to give to a Senate campaign and not setting up a PAC to do it.
[00:25:49.953 --> 00:25:50.653]  Totally legal.
[00:25:50.873 --> 00:25:55.395]  He just didn't dot an I. And I told you they're coming for everybody.
[00:25:58.268 --> 00:26:04.670]  They're gonna bring in 300,000 refugees out of the Middle East, admittedly full of Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and they'll end up attacking.
[00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:14.073]  But don't worry, the FBI's too busy with the FTC and the SEC and everybody else harassing small businesses.
[00:26:14.313 --> 00:26:17.394]  This morning I got up real early and I was just looking at FTC and SEC stuff.
[00:26:19.727 --> 00:26:29.430]  And it's just like they'll go after some supplement company that Arnold's involved with because over four years they charge business vacations in golf to the company.
[00:26:30.451 --> 00:26:33.752]  And then I go read the code and that's totally kosher, but they don't care.
[00:26:33.932 --> 00:26:40.454]  They'll go after people for playing golf at company outings that's part of company entertainment
[00:26:42.455 --> 00:26:47.958]  And try to put people in jail while the SEC and others knew for years about Bernie Madoff and did nothing.
[00:26:48.379 --> 00:26:51.301]  They know all about the big banks laundering drug money and do nothing.
[00:26:52.541 --> 00:26:54.723]  The CIA runs the major drug cartels.
[00:26:55.883 --> 00:26:59.526]  Our troops are made to grow the opium in Afghanistan on record.
[00:26:59.966 --> 00:27:05.789]  But if they catch your teenage daughter or son with one shot of heroin, five years in prison.
[00:27:08.331 --> 00:27:09.152]  A ruined record.
[00:27:09.372 --> 00:27:11.113]  And when they get out, they got a five-year
[00:27:12.617 --> 00:27:14.318]  Education and criminal operations.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.080]  A five-year degree.
[00:27:20.902 --> 00:27:22.462]  That's how sick all this is.
[00:27:24.063 --> 00:27:30.907]  And we've got the blackmailed, controlled Congress, the blackmailed, controlled Supreme Court, as the crazy train goes right over the cliff.
[00:27:34.969 --> 00:27:39.672]  And we've got a Justice Department that shipped
[00:27:41.218 --> 00:27:47.982]  Over 20,000 firearms in New Mexico to demonize the Second Amendment and run a false flag.
[00:27:48.262 --> 00:27:50.623]  CBS News even got the memo.
[00:27:50.644 --> 00:27:52.825]  I was saying it was clearly a false flag.
[00:27:52.965 --> 00:27:56.947]  They got it saying this is going to be used to blame the Second Amendment and restrict firearm ownership.
[00:27:57.107 --> 00:28:00.809]  That's the plan to field agents who were getting upset and didn't want to be part of it.
[00:28:03.171 --> 00:28:05.412]  And you know what they did to the reporter that broke it from CBS News?
[00:28:05.552 --> 00:28:06.753]  They fired her.
[00:28:08.643 --> 00:28:09.244]  But you know what?
[00:28:09.804 --> 00:28:10.725]  She has her honor.
[00:28:11.225 --> 00:28:12.186]  She's a good person.
[00:28:13.928 --> 00:28:23.136]  We have the biggest war on the press this country has ever seen by Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:28:23.176 --> 00:28:27.941]  I mean, that's admitted by Jonathan Turley, who's been a guest on the show, the liberal constitutional scholar.
[00:28:30.303 --> 00:28:34.287]  It's a fact that Obama has jailed more journalists
[00:28:35.407 --> 00:28:42.552]  And gone after more whistleblowers than all modern presidents in the last hundred years, together.
[00:28:44.313 --> 00:28:45.554]  Since those laws were on the books.
[00:28:46.535 --> 00:28:48.716]  The Trading with the Enemy Act, the Sedition Act, all of it.
[00:28:51.498 --> 00:28:55.881]  But because he's black, it's supposedly trendy, so it's okay.
[00:29:02.435 --> 00:29:05.177]  Does anyone feel safe having a government like this?
[00:29:05.197 --> 00:29:14.583]  Does anyone feel safe with the President, outside of law, just shuts down a thousand plus power plants and increases our power prices and gives General Electric waivers to make huge profits because they're not under it?
[00:29:15.544 --> 00:29:20.587]  Does anyone feel safe with states all over just starting forced inoculation, even outside of law?
[00:29:22.247 --> 00:29:25.869]  Because laying down to these people is what's got us to this position.
[00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:33.352]  The reason America had lower taxes, was freer, everybody wanted to move here, was the people wouldn't put up with tyranny and would fight back against it.
[00:29:35.066 --> 00:29:37.728]  We were known as fighters, and so we had prosperity.
[00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:40.551]  Really, that's all America had was the fact we were fighters.
[00:29:40.751 --> 00:29:49.178]  We had a lot of problems, but there were constantly brush wars, constantly people standing up against corrupt government, local, state, federal, constant fights with the railroads.
[00:29:50.039 --> 00:29:51.360]  Americans didn't bend over.
[00:29:52.101 --> 00:29:52.921]  That's why we were great.
[00:29:53.161 --> 00:29:59.267]  Now, we've gone from the greatest to some of the most servile people in the world, and it's time to stop it.
[00:30:00.017 --> 00:30:03.018]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:03.939 --> 00:30:06.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.863]  Hey Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[00:30:12.923 --> 00:30:15.804]  Did you know that Pope Francis has strong ties to communism?
[00:30:16.044 --> 00:30:22.287]  Francis is a member of the Jesuits who developed the so-called liberation theology, which many have labeled Christianized Marxism.
[00:30:22.507 --> 00:30:26.649]  They're the reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin America.
[00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:32.832]  And it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader, Raul Castro, praised Pope Francis for his anti-capitalist stance.
[00:30:33.093 --> 00:30:35.794]  Castro, like Francis, was also brought up by the Jesuits.
[00:30:36.094 --> 00:30:41.357]  Starting to make sense now why Francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes and more government?
[00:30:41.578 --> 00:30:44.319]  And also, did you know the recent reconciliation between the U.S.
[00:30:44.379 --> 00:30:47.601]  and Cuba was spearheaded by Pope Francis to the benefit of Castro?
[00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:55.986]  Vatican researcher Leo Zagami wrote an excellent article on InfoWars.com entitled, Vatican Flag to Fly Over the New World Order, which breaks it all down.
[00:30:56.266 --> 00:31:06.348]  Zoghami wrote, Barack Obama and Raul Castro's mundialist leftist agenda is guided and supervised by the first Jesuit Pope in history to help the Cubans embrace the new world order with enthusiasm.
[00:31:06.448 --> 00:31:10.149]  Keep checking InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.

[00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:13.540]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:21.863]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:32:22.083 --> 00:32:27.104]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:32:41.314 --> 00:32:43.415]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:43.535 --> 00:32:48.256]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:48.516 --> 00:32:51.657]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:51.797 --> 00:32:55.018]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:55.298 --> 00:32:57.098]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:57.278 --> 00:33:01.299]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that do it clean.
[00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:06.980]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:21.966 --> 00:33:29.750]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:48.221]  So to be clear, it is a badge of courage, a badge of honor to have MSNBC, CNN, the Houston Chronicle, the LA Times, the New York Times, basically every major publication in the country on a weekly basis or so
[00:33:49.423 --> 00:33:59.830]  Writes articles claiming I want to kill police, that I say the world's ending in September, that Jade Helms is going to be martial law, and just constant lies.
[00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.893]  That I influence the Boston Bombers, that I'm deeply racist.
[00:34:06.714 --> 00:34:10.917]  We're under massive disinformation attack because they want to inoculate people
[00:34:12.495 --> 00:34:26.104]  Psychologically, intellectually, mentally, to hate Infowars.com, to hate Alex Jones, to assassinate my name, before someone finds the website, the radio show, the films, for themselves.
[00:34:27.245 --> 00:34:28.566]  Because it's so dramatic.
[00:34:28.606 --> 00:34:34.230]  We get like 97% positive votes on YouTube.
[00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:35.571]  Nobody gets that.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.602]  Our products get five-star ratings, just unheard of.
[00:34:46.003 --> 00:34:47.644]  We're growing exponentially.
[00:34:47.744 --> 00:34:51.166]  Even as the economy implodes, the audience is expanding.
[00:34:52.046 --> 00:34:59.129]  So even though less revenue comes in per listener, we're able to still expand even in the face of a media implosion.
[00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.950]  The world's in a depression.
[00:35:02.951 --> 00:35:06.673]  And people are waking up now in droves all over the country and the planet.
[00:35:07.563 --> 00:35:17.746]  And so they're going after any leadership, whether it be Governor Abbott of Texas or the Attorney General of Texas or other conservative libertarian Republicans.
[00:35:20.147 --> 00:35:22.127]  They're going after everybody, folks.
[00:35:22.908 --> 00:35:28.249]  I expect they'll try to go after Walter Jones, the congressman who's joining us next hour, who spearheaded getting rid of Boehner.
[00:35:28.289 --> 00:35:29.390]  Praise God that happened today.
[00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:32.531]  I expect they'll go after Louie Gohmert.
[00:35:36.472 --> 00:35:37.112]  Chuck Norris,
[00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.611]  I got sent a photo this morning from Chuck Norris and his son.
[00:35:43.631 --> 00:35:45.312]  We're asking permission to tweet it.
[00:35:45.332 --> 00:35:46.252]  They haven't tweeted back yet.
[00:35:47.913 --> 00:36:01.679]  When his son, Mike Norris, who's a big filmmaker in his own right, was here in studio with us, he went ahead and openly said that his dad told him point blank, you get involved in the liberty movement.
[00:36:02.539 --> 00:36:02.900]  Oh, there it is.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.400]  We did tweet it.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.921]  It's on Real Alex Jones with the Infowars shirt.
[00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:12.542]  He said, get ready for him to come and try to kill you or set you up or indict you.
[00:36:12.982 --> 00:36:14.622]  But he said, I'm very proud of what you're doing.
[00:36:16.222 --> 00:36:18.803]  And his son told that story sitting right next to me here a few months ago.
[00:36:18.823 --> 00:36:24.404]  Because they're putting a movie out about a martial law takeover in America that I'm in.
[00:36:27.445 --> 00:36:32.785]  And you better believe that their family has been put under a lot of pressure as well.
[00:36:32.926 --> 00:36:35.226]  This is what goes on in the so-called free country.
[00:36:36.403 --> 00:36:44.911]  In America, Chuck Norris told his son, Mike Norris, who learned how to ride motorcycles with Steve McQueen.
[00:36:46.072 --> 00:36:47.053]  Americana patriot.
[00:36:49.555 --> 00:36:51.357]  You do this, there's a good chance they're going to kill you.
[00:36:51.957 --> 00:36:52.958]  But I'm proud of what you're doing.
[00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:56.982]  That's what's really going on in America.
[00:37:00.345 --> 00:37:01.806]  And most people are intimidated.
[00:37:02.246 --> 00:37:06.068]  I would be intimidated by putting my tail between my legs and giving in to it.
[00:37:06.948 --> 00:37:11.130]  Because that's scarier than having them pull me over, plant drugs on me.
[00:37:14.892 --> 00:37:16.293]  God knows what they're gonna make up.
[00:37:17.094 --> 00:37:17.634]  God knows.
[00:37:19.235 --> 00:37:21.116]  And I just see it as a foregone conclusion.
[00:37:21.216 --> 00:37:25.878]  I don't want it to happen, but what brings me solace is just accepting it.
[00:37:28.547 --> 00:37:30.348]  I consider myself to be dead already.
[00:37:31.909 --> 00:37:33.790]  And I'll tell you, that's when you're really alive.
[00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:41.013]  I remember I was talking to my uncle a few months before he got sick and died last year.
[00:37:41.033 --> 00:37:43.855]  So it was in 2013 I was talking to him.
[00:37:43.875 --> 00:37:45.396]  He died in January of 2014.
[00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:49.758]  And he'd been in a lot of secret helicopter operations with special forces.
[00:37:50.298 --> 00:37:51.379]  Shot down seven times.
[00:37:51.419 --> 00:37:55.561]  He never even told us that until we dug through his army chest one time when he was at work.
[00:37:57.045 --> 00:38:00.068]  And I was driving along with him talking about the death threats and the dirty tricks.
[00:38:00.108 --> 00:38:03.351]  And he said, I said, you know, though, the great part is God gives me comfort.
[00:38:03.391 --> 00:38:06.113]  I just turned it off and think that I'm basically dead already.
[00:38:06.133 --> 00:38:08.475]  He looked at me, he goes, that's what you've got to do.
[00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:17.143]  And just the way he said it, it was like, he had totally understood what I was saying.
[00:38:17.163 --> 00:38:19.265]  I understood what he was saying.
[00:38:19.405 --> 00:38:20.646]  And that's what it's really all about.
[00:38:21.747 --> 00:38:22.488]  I'm dead already.
[00:38:25.097 --> 00:38:27.858]  And that's when you're really alive, folks, is when you're dead already.
[00:38:30.159 --> 00:38:31.759]  There's nothing they can take from me now.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.320]  Not my children, not my name, nothing.
[00:38:34.881 --> 00:38:45.104]  I know that I've stood for what's right and what's good, and all the haters, and all their agents, and all their minions that have failed so many times before, I believe in my heart of hearts, you'll fail yet again.
[00:38:47.505 --> 00:38:49.286]  But whatever comes out of this,
[00:38:50.529 --> 00:38:53.473]  In the final equation, I've stood for what's right and what's just.
[00:38:54.254 --> 00:38:56.857]  And more people need to do that today.
[00:38:59.681 --> 00:39:03.386]  And more people need to tell their friends and family about InfoWars.com.
[00:39:04.707 --> 00:39:07.430]  And the forbidden information, what the system doesn't want you to have.
[00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:11.173]  More people need to become bold and stand up because they can't stop us all.
[00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:13.015]  And they know that's happening now.
[00:39:13.235 --> 00:39:14.957]  They know the military's blowing the whistle.
[00:39:15.217 --> 00:39:17.319]  They know people inside government are telling the truth.
[00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:18.920]  They know the truth's coming out.
[00:39:19.141 --> 00:39:22.624]  And I can look in the eyes of the New World Order and I can tell you they're scared.
[00:39:24.431 --> 00:39:27.153]  And they should be, because truth and justice is coming.
[00:39:27.914 --> 00:39:29.635]  And they cannot shut us all up.
[00:39:30.035 --> 00:39:32.997]  And the spirit of America is rising to face this tyranny.
[00:39:33.218 --> 00:39:35.679]  Are we really going to put up with a war on the press in this nation?
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:37.501]  Let's go to my report.
[00:39:38.321 --> 00:39:38.682]  Obama.
[00:39:40.342 --> 00:39:45.627]  is working on shutting down major independent American news operation.
[00:39:46.367 --> 00:39:50.971]  And again, I have this directly from multiple sources.
[00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:52.432]  This is going on.
[00:39:52.873 --> 00:39:54.134]  This is what they're up to.
[00:39:54.654 --> 00:39:56.035]  This is how they're operating.
[00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:57.657]  This is what they're doing.
[00:39:58.177 --> 00:40:08.306]  And it's all about the shutdown of information so they can fully take down this country and take your pension funds and gut the borders further and take down this civilization.
[00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.431]  And I want to ask you the question, are you going to put up with it?
[00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:17.832]  Because groveling and giving into this has only made it worse.
[00:40:18.532 --> 00:40:21.933]  Here is the report.
[00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:25.194]  And at the end, I'll add some points that I didn't have in the report.
[00:40:25.214 --> 00:40:39.157]  I need to write some notes on this because it was point blank that they want to shut down this operation or wound it or keep it from reaching more people or keep it from growing.
[00:40:40.933 --> 00:40:46.076]  Because they understand that we're a conduit that can force major stories out.
[00:40:46.116 --> 00:40:54.801]  I mean, Walter Jones is coming on with us next hour, a congressman who came on this show and went on others, but admitted this show was one of the main groups.
[00:40:54.861 --> 00:40:56.121]  You, the audience, are the power.
[00:40:56.462 --> 00:40:57.182]  You are the people.
[00:40:58.983 --> 00:41:03.806]  And that you coming on, and you supporting what we're doing, and you coming on board,
[00:41:04.938 --> 00:41:10.101]  Is the reason that he believed a month ago that Boehner would be stepping down, and now it's happened.
[00:41:10.402 --> 00:41:11.262]  Do you understand that?
[00:41:12.943 --> 00:41:29.034]  In a sea of passive people, in an ocean of cowards, in an ocean of brain-numbed, zombified sheeple, InfoWars is a gathering place, a focal point for millions of people that will stand up against the bullies.
[00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.271]  And the crooks are scared.
[00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:33.435]  They've committed so many crimes and been so arrogant.
[00:41:33.735 --> 00:41:34.897]  Their back's against the wall.
[00:41:34.957 --> 00:41:36.739]  They're committed to their cause.
[00:41:38.682 --> 00:41:39.523]  And all its evils.
[00:41:41.145 --> 00:41:43.449]  And God always does this before a nation is judged.
[00:41:44.994 --> 00:41:46.414]  The evil is brought out in the open.
[00:41:47.054 --> 00:41:49.935]  The people are given a choice whether they're going to go with it or stand against it.
[00:41:50.415 --> 00:41:51.855]  And you're all being given your choice right now.
[00:41:52.196 --> 00:42:13.420]  If America doesn't repent now and turn back, and if the churches don't stop being government institutions, and if the military and the police and the FBI and the rest of you don't start speaking out more and putting your careers on the line more to tell the truth and to blow the whistle, we're going to be judged worse than Germany was by the end of World War II, when one-third of the Germans were killed.
[00:42:15.336 --> 00:42:17.637]  You don't really see that on the news, but that's in the history books.
[00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:30.824]  I can assure you that if this goes through, within a decade, they're going to purge everyone that served them and helped bring the system in, probably sooner.
[00:42:31.684 --> 00:42:33.545]  You will be in the exact same position
[00:42:36.164 --> 00:42:40.706]  As the Attorney General of Texas has been indicted, and all the... and Dinesh D'Souza and everybody else.
[00:42:41.206 --> 00:42:46.188]  In America, we now face the Soviet NKVD level thuggery.
[00:42:46.528 --> 00:42:47.188]  Look in Germany.
[00:42:47.228 --> 00:42:48.649]  You criticize the open borders there?
[00:42:48.889 --> 00:42:50.550]  They have reactivated the Stasi.
[00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.090]  That's mainstream German news.
[00:42:52.411 --> 00:42:59.813]  And have them putting people in jail for 120 days and or 5,000 euro fines for saying you don't like open borders.
[00:43:01.134 --> 00:43:03.355]  That's the cultural Marxism.
[00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:10.096]  They mean business folks, and I'm not intimidated by them.
[00:43:10.437 --> 00:43:18.403]  I'm not gonna hide in some corner waiting for them or grovel to the system in the hopes they back off.
[00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:21.405]  This is an illegitimate system by every yardstick.
[00:43:21.685 --> 00:43:23.207]  It's committed so many crimes.
[00:43:23.527 --> 00:43:27.530]  The FBI Crime Lab, I've had the former head of it on, admitting it was totally manufactured.
[00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.093]  The whole system is rotten and evil.
[00:43:31.453 --> 00:43:34.956]  It doesn't mean everybody in it is evil, but from the top, it's evil.
[00:43:37.168 --> 00:43:43.053]  And it isn't fit to clean out a port-a-potty, much less execute justice.
[00:43:43.093 --> 00:43:44.534]  We've now reached this crisis.
[00:43:44.774 --> 00:43:54.441]  And they plan to use this societal constitutional crisis to collapse the old system completely and bring in complete tyranny that makes this tyranny look like a cakewalk.
[00:43:54.741 --> 00:44:00.626]  Let's go to the special breakdown where I go over all of this.
[00:44:01.547 --> 00:44:02.708]  And again, it's key to understand
[00:44:03.817 --> 00:44:11.163]  The White House tasked the FBI, Texas Division, that sector to dig up stuff, couldn't do it.
[00:44:11.603 --> 00:44:30.718]  Then they didn't want it to be political, they went to the FTC and around to some other federal agencies to sheep-dip that it's directly out of the White House and the Justice Department, and now they've got an FBI task force working for the Federal Trade Commission with whole rooms of senior people
[00:44:32.045 --> 00:44:34.726]  And when they do something like that, they will make something up.
[00:44:35.086 --> 00:44:39.007]  So, I say, politically, you've already filled your hand.
[00:44:40.008 --> 00:44:41.028]  That's what this is all about.
[00:44:41.108 --> 00:44:46.010]  Folks, you don't think George Washington and all them, when they signed the Declaration of Independence, didn't know what they were doing.
[00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.830]  I know what I'm doing.
[00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:53.772]  So don't... I take that pleasure away from you, that you think I'm like you and I'm a coward.
[00:44:53.852 --> 00:44:54.572]  I'm not a coward.
[00:44:54.772 --> 00:44:55.633]  Let's go to this report.
[00:44:55.953 --> 00:44:56.273]  Here it is.
[00:45:07.051 --> 00:45:16.017]  A few years ago, the Pentagon issued a report containing research dealing with controlling domestic populations here in the United States.
[00:45:16.897 --> 00:45:24.542]  And they weren't worried about communists, they weren't worried about radical Islamists, they weren't worried about conservatives or liberals or even peace activists.
[00:45:25.503 --> 00:45:36.130]  They were concerned about what they called empowered individuals who were taking action peacefully in the society to change the status quo.
[00:45:37.472 --> 00:45:38.572]  What is the status quo?
[00:45:39.813 --> 00:45:49.536]  The status quo is a rapid consolidation of wealth by the elite through crony capitalism and the public being domesticated via systems of socialism.
[00:45:51.577 --> 00:45:53.597]  The status quo is the breakdown of the family.
[00:45:53.657 --> 00:45:55.558]  The status quo is the end of our borders.
[00:45:55.978 --> 00:46:06.682]  The status quo is our government funding radical jihadists all over the Middle East and Africa and Central Asia to destabilize Christian areas and to kill other minority groups.
[00:46:09.079 --> 00:46:23.523]  Now, it was about a year ago that a FBI source, an FBI individual, contacted me to let me know that everything I was doing was being monitored and surveilled.
[00:46:23.843 --> 00:46:25.343]  And it was a very credible individual.
[00:46:26.964 --> 00:46:32.145]  And then today, I got contacted by an extremely credible individual.
[00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:35.066]  Many people out there would know their name.
[00:46:37.242 --> 00:46:45.012]  That the Obama administration has had enough of info wars and is worried about the fact that we are empowering people.
[00:46:45.633 --> 00:46:47.295]  That we are empowered individuals.
[00:46:48.116 --> 00:46:49.397]  And that we are bringing people together.
[00:46:51.179 --> 00:46:55.385]  And that they've got the entire operation lined up and ready.
[00:46:56.673 --> 00:47:03.316]  To pull a search and seizure, news cameras, whole nine yards raid on InfoWars.
[00:47:03.816 --> 00:47:12.940]  Now the whole point of that is like the cases with the Amish, where they sell their neighbor cheese, and then the feds SWAT team them and put their head on the ground and they've got helicopters.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.522]  It's to create the perception that you must really be a bad guy.
[00:47:17.422 --> 00:47:18.843]  But people see through that now.
[00:47:19.718 --> 00:47:20.338]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:47:20.959 --> 00:47:23.801]  They believe we have the full faith and credit of the U.S.
[00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:26.423]  federal government, so we can do whatever we want.
[00:47:26.463 --> 00:47:28.164]  We can commit any crime we want.
[00:47:28.405 --> 00:47:29.245]  We can get away with it.
[00:47:29.445 --> 00:47:37.631]  We can have Planned Parenthood openly sell baby parts, and we can see babies fighting scalpels with their hands, alive, out of the womb, and it's okay.
[00:47:37.892 --> 00:47:39.052]  Nobody's gonna get in trouble.
[00:47:40.754 --> 00:47:44.657]  Some folks back in the 40s, early 40s in Western Europe, thought that too.
[00:47:47.259 --> 00:47:51.581]  And my grandfathers weren't afraid of those bullies, and I'm not afraid of you.
[00:47:51.601 --> 00:47:53.922]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:47:54.102 --> 00:48:01.345]  I feel empowered, I feel strong, and I feel absolutely committed to telling the truth and exposing what's happening.
[00:48:02.786 --> 00:48:07.308]  But reportedly they have a FBI task force, one directly under
[00:48:09.383 --> 00:48:15.909]  The head of the FBI, in D.C., the major white-collar crime task force that goes after Lacosa, Nostra, you name it.
[00:48:15.929 --> 00:48:18.851]  They don't go after the Federal Reserve that actually runs the drugs or launders the money.
[00:48:19.432 --> 00:48:20.533]  The Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[00:48:20.553 --> 00:48:21.394]  Morgan, of course not.
[00:48:21.814 --> 00:48:22.555]  Or Wells Fargo.
[00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:32.157]  And they've got them in their whole rooms of men and women just pouring over everything and their fake informants and all the rest of it to try to manufacture something.
[00:48:32.417 --> 00:48:33.157]  And that's the word.
[00:48:33.197 --> 00:48:38.182]  They're very confident that they can raid this facility and make something up.
[00:48:38.242 --> 00:48:39.122]  So go ahead.
[00:48:40.203 --> 00:48:41.905]  You've already committed to who you are.
[00:48:41.925 --> 00:48:44.407]  You've already committed to what you stand for.
[00:48:45.307 --> 00:48:46.248]  I know what I stand for.
[00:48:46.428 --> 00:48:47.089]  I know what I've done.
[00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:53.013]  And anything you pull out of a hat is just that, a rabbit trick, and folks know you're a magician.
[00:48:53.493 --> 00:48:58.235]  The public isn't like children anymore, where they're three years old and believe a rabbit really came out of the hat.
[00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:03.376]  There's a table with a trap door, you put the hat on it, you open it, and put the rabbit up in and then pull it out.
[00:49:07.218 --> 00:49:16.081]  And you know, my source was saying, well by doing this, it may put a fly in their ointment, because you know, they want to be able to have it all Hollywood style.
[00:49:17.503 --> 00:49:22.326]  And I said, you know, I'm not even going to come out and talk about this because of that.
[00:49:22.346 --> 00:49:25.629]  I mean, I trust in God, just like George Washington did.
[00:49:26.522 --> 00:49:35.026]  I think about how he faced 40-50,000 troops landing in the north and 30-40,000 landing in the south and another 30-40,000 coming in a month later.
[00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:38.087]  I mean, they were burning down folks' houses, they were killing everybody.
[00:49:38.107 --> 00:49:41.648]  I mean, I'm nothing compared to the forebearers of this nation.
[00:49:41.908 --> 00:49:44.910]  But my ancestors were there and were involved in it all.
[00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:50.072]  And they were greater men than I. And so, I'm here facing a bunch of discredited
[00:49:51.073 --> 00:49:56.996]  Evil people who have a bunch of cowards amongst their midst who are compartmentalized who are going along with this.
[00:49:58.077 --> 00:50:02.379]  And so what I face is nothing compared to my ancestors.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.260]  So I have no fear.
[00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:10.664]  I only hope that I can try to measure at least partially up to what they did.
[00:50:12.912 --> 00:50:30.448]  Now, it was also said when I called a couple of my lawyers that are pretty high-powered and smart, they said, you know, this could be a way to further try to discredit you, you know, they write those articles where you said Jade Helm would be martial law, and it wasn't, but of course you didn't say that, and where the end of the world was coming in September, you didn't say that, but they say you said that.
[00:50:31.709 --> 00:50:38.255]  I'd be careful on this because it takes a lot to have an administration come after the press
[00:50:40.476 --> 00:50:43.218]  And this is really a bold move if they do this.
[00:50:44.079 --> 00:50:45.200]  But they had to concede.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:50.804]  We've seen a record reign of terror on mainline reporters, on whistleblowers.
[00:50:51.805 --> 00:50:53.986]  And so this is really part of the climate we're going into.
[00:50:54.507 --> 00:50:56.969]  I hope this is just people jerking my chain.
[00:50:57.489 --> 00:51:01.572]  I hope this is just folks trying to get a reaction.
[00:51:02.213 --> 00:51:07.617]  Because regardless of whether this is real or not, real people in the FBI,
[00:51:09.301 --> 00:51:16.788]  Continue to contact me to say, this is coming, this is being done, be ready.
[00:51:17.228 --> 00:51:17.769]  Be ready!
[00:51:18.229 --> 00:51:20.851]  I have outside accounting firms that do all the accounting.
[00:51:20.912 --> 00:51:22.173]  I can't even balance my own checkbook.
[00:51:22.933 --> 00:51:23.754]  I'm not a math guy.
[00:51:24.034 --> 00:51:26.757]  I have two outside firms, one that does it, one that audits it.
[00:51:27.237 --> 00:51:28.438]  Everything's transparent.
[00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:30.981]  In fact, that's the other thing.
[00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:33.403]  You sit back and you think, what is it they're going to cook up?
[00:51:34.693 --> 00:51:37.856]  One of my lawyers says it'll probably be supplements, but you've got outside lawyers.
[00:51:37.876 --> 00:51:41.119]  You use outside top facilities that produce it for you.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:43.822]  You're a private labeler for your formulas.
[00:51:45.743 --> 00:51:48.346]  That's probably, oh, that's the other big kicker.
[00:51:48.946 --> 00:51:50.608]  It's the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:51:51.889 --> 00:51:52.590]  The FTC.
[00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:57.615]  When I heard that, I remembered the fact that I was on the phone with Mark Cuban.
[00:51:59.377 --> 00:52:07.044]  I only talked to him a couple times and he was going to put out a film that I'd produced exposing Saudi involvement in 9-11, which is now basically admitted in the 28 pages.
[00:52:07.684 --> 00:52:11.828]  And he called back a few days later to the Hollywood producer and said, I can't do this now.
[00:52:12.088 --> 00:52:15.211]  He was going to put it on 1,100 screens and put it in stores everywhere.
[00:52:15.231 --> 00:52:17.893]  You know, the host of Shark Tank, owner of the Mavericks.
[00:52:18.894 --> 00:52:27.141]  He said, they called me up, the Bush FTC, and said, we're going to put you in prison for insider trading for putting this film out.
[00:52:28.564 --> 00:52:29.305]  And it was SEC.
[00:52:29.325 --> 00:52:30.626]  He said, listen, I got a family.
[00:52:30.786 --> 00:52:31.987]  I'm not going to be involved in this.
[00:52:33.228 --> 00:52:34.309]  Wow, this is really deep.
[00:52:35.931 --> 00:52:40.955]  And he came out and apologized in the news for talking about putting out loose change.
[00:52:41.636 --> 00:52:52.986]  A year later, New York Times comes out with an email, not just a call, with the Fed saying, we're going to indict you for insider trading because you put this film out.
[00:52:53.993 --> 00:52:54.853]  Or you're talking about it.
[00:52:55.433 --> 00:52:59.735]  That's how crazy and on a power trip these feds are.
[00:53:00.415 --> 00:53:10.638]  That they would call a guy worth five billion dollars on the phone and email him and say we're gonna put you in prison for talking about putting this film out and then he still
[00:53:11.977 --> 00:53:17.846]  Gave in to him, got on his knees, and they still came and tried to indict him, not once but twice.
[00:53:18.087 --> 00:53:19.269]  He didn't do insider trading.
[00:53:19.449 --> 00:53:20.971]  Listen, I'm no Martha Stewart.
[00:53:21.712 --> 00:53:25.759]  I know you've written the federal laws where taking a crap in your own toilet's illegal.
[00:53:26.897 --> 00:53:33.199]  I know that you've, you know, got this whole thing set up with your fake grand juries and your federal juries and all the rest of it.
[00:53:33.219 --> 00:53:37.120]  Don't ever think that I got into this not knowing the stakes.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:42.342]  Don't ever think I got into this not knowing criminals run this country now.
[00:53:43.402 --> 00:53:47.443]  I mean, hell, you people are in baby part business.
[00:53:47.723 --> 00:53:49.724]  You keep babies alive and sell their organs.
[00:53:50.124 --> 00:53:51.764]  You protect the people that do that.
[00:53:52.305 --> 00:53:56.266]  DynCorp and Halliburton that's come out are in the child trafficking rings.
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:53:59.081]  You people bring the narcotics in.
[00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:00.803]  I mean, you don't think I don't know that?
[00:54:01.924 --> 00:54:05.327]  I just always love how you try to intimidate me and you act like I don't know.
[00:54:05.567 --> 00:54:06.188]  I know!
[00:54:06.208 --> 00:54:11.052]  I have a moral responsibility to stand up to you.
[00:54:11.893 --> 00:54:13.174]  And I will continue to do it.
[00:54:15.816 --> 00:54:17.758]  And I may be destroyed in the process.
[00:54:17.798 --> 00:54:18.759]  That's part of God's plan.
[00:54:20.868 --> 00:54:28.615]  But in the final equation, my listeners and my viewers are the empowered people, and they're the power of Infowars.com.
[00:54:29.976 --> 00:54:33.219]  They're the power of liberty and freedom.
[00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.782]  I'm not the person that's important, and they're not going to go away.
[00:54:37.843 --> 00:54:43.849]  And they'll know in their hearts that whatever it is you're going to make up is a load of manure.
[00:54:44.878 --> 00:54:50.042]  This isn't the FBI and the CIA and the NSA of 30 years ago when you still had the public trust.
[00:54:50.162 --> 00:54:51.263]  You don't have its trust.
[00:54:52.704 --> 00:54:56.567]  And you're just moving forward with America's inertia as if this can go on forever.
[00:54:57.427 --> 00:55:12.018]  The head of defense intelligence, the general, and the deputy head of the CIA have all gone public in the last two months saying our government ordered them to aid Al Qaeda and ISIS and that it's evil and they're fixing intelligence.
[00:55:12.158 --> 00:55:12.899]  Our military
[00:55:14.096 --> 00:55:15.737]  is standing up and doing the right thing.
[00:55:16.398 --> 00:55:18.599]  And they know that all started here four or five years ago.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.701]  Again, it's about empowerment.
[00:55:20.721 --> 00:55:24.083]  It's about people believing doing the right thing can change the world.
[00:55:24.564 --> 00:55:25.704]  And I don't believe it.
[00:55:26.145 --> 00:55:27.065]  I know it.
[00:55:28.466 --> 00:55:43.417]  And so I'll tell you right now, my gut tells me we're gonna get more orders, more purchases, more support, more AM and FM affiliates, more TV affiliates, more support than we've ever gotten before because of what is reportedly being tried right now.
[00:55:44.867 --> 00:55:55.438]  And if you actually try to cook something up, no one's gonna buy it except for your little stable of kept, blackmailed, controlled juries and grand jurists.
[00:55:56.479 --> 00:55:59.122]  But a lot of juries aren't corrupt, a lot of judges aren't corrupt as well.
[00:55:59.402 --> 00:56:00.143]  You know, I think about
[00:56:01.462 --> 00:56:11.107]  Joe Bannister, who I first interviewed back in like 1999, highly decorated, great career, federal treasury agent, you know, doing raids on people.
[00:56:11.687 --> 00:56:14.468]  He hears a show about the Federal Reserve being private, the IRS being a scam.
[00:56:14.488 --> 00:56:15.149]  He doesn't believe it.
[00:56:15.389 --> 00:56:16.469]  He sets out to disprove it.
[00:56:16.709 --> 00:56:18.430]  Two years later, goes and talks to his bosses.
[00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:20.331]  He says, this looks like it's true.
[00:56:20.371 --> 00:56:21.192]  They said, just resign.
[00:56:22.292 --> 00:56:22.992]  That wasn't enough.
[00:56:23.032 --> 00:56:25.834]  Then they indicted him, not once, but twice.
[00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:32.734]  For tax fraud, for giving speeches about it in America, and both juries found him not guilty.
[00:56:33.414 --> 00:56:42.601]  So you see, I only begin to join the ranks of incredible men like him and Erwin Schiff in federal prison for exposing the IRS.
[00:56:43.002 --> 00:56:45.283]  I mean, this is what it's all about.
[00:56:45.944 --> 00:56:50.647]  And when I die, when they bury me six feet under, when I'm pushing daisies, I'm not going to be
[00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:58.998]  Listed with all the cowards over there that went along with being a bunch of parasites and gangs who feel so safe in their cowardice part of their little cruise.
[00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:01.681]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:57:01.721 --> 00:57:05.905]  We are about human empowerment and I know it shook them up, the money bomb.
[00:57:06.726 --> 00:57:08.288]  I mean, you know how much money we have to bring in to run this?
[00:57:08.328 --> 00:57:08.828]  That's nothing.
[00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:12.572]  I know it shook the system up to know that we've got 1.4, 1.6
[00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:18.341]  Billion people reached every month via social media.
[00:57:18.661 --> 00:57:19.442]  I know it shakes you up.
[00:57:19.482 --> 00:57:21.343]  We have billions of views online every year.
[00:57:21.363 --> 00:57:22.725]  I know it shakes you up.
[00:57:22.785 --> 00:57:25.066]  We reach 3-4 million people terrestrial radio a day.
[00:57:25.387 --> 00:57:27.709]  We got a million podcast listeners a day.
[00:57:27.729 --> 00:57:28.829]  And it's all growing.
[00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:29.590]  Absolutely!
[00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:38.797]  But I know as we rise to face you, for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction, that you're gonna do this.
[00:57:39.818 --> 00:57:41.380]  You are playing your role.
[00:57:42.403 --> 00:57:44.904]  You think you've chosen the right God, the right team.
[00:57:45.644 --> 00:57:48.485]  I've chosen the side I'm on, and that's where I am forever.
[00:57:49.206 --> 00:57:59.950]  And it is a fulfilling feeling, a buoying feeling, to know that I'm on the side of right, and to show people they can be empowered and stand up against the Goliaths of this world.
[00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:05.812]  Because it doesn't matter what happens to me, I'll inspire a million Davids against you.
[00:58:06.972 --> 00:58:08.593]  Because that's what InfoWars has always been.
[00:58:09.585 --> 00:58:12.948]  I think you could call it Operation David in the final equation.
[00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:15.750]  Don't take this broadcast for granted.
[00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:18.112]  Don't take what we do here for granted because the enemy doesn't like it.
[00:58:18.392 --> 00:58:18.732]  Know that.
[00:58:18.752 --> 00:58:21.234]  I want to thank you all and salute you for spreading the word.
[00:58:21.274 --> 00:58:26.499]  You are the modern Paul Reveres in this eternal fight against evil in Operation David.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.981]  That Operation David thing just came to me there.
[00:58:30.021 --> 00:58:33.384]  That was teleprompter-free, 13-minute long transmission.
[00:58:33.404 --> 00:58:37.768]  That's why I said FTC, not SEC with the Mark Cuban situation.
[00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:46.278]  And I said for every action there is a opposite and equal reaction when it's an equal opposite.
[00:58:46.598 --> 00:58:47.299]  Either way, I guess.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.220]  We'll be back.
[00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:48.801]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:49.982]  Congressman Jones coming up.
[00:58:50.042 --> 00:58:50.983]  He unseated Boehner.
[00:58:51.043 --> 00:58:51.583]  Praise God.
[00:58:51.603 --> 00:58:57.349]  Now the fight is to decide who we're going to put in place there.
[00:59:00.729 --> 00:59:10.640]  Most of the InfoWars radio listening audience is aware of the high-quality, affordable firearms available that are made right here in America at HDFirearms.com.

[00:59:53.088 --> 00:59:56.149]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:16.724 --> 01:00:17.365]  Big Brother.
[01:00:18.025 --> 01:00:19.046]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:19.787 --> 01:00:20.888]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.548 --> 01:00:22.349]  You want answers?
[01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:24.030]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:24.671 --> 01:00:28.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:32.978]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:40.124]  One commenter comments that Obama's enemies list is about 53% of the population.
[01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:40.465]  Yeah.
[01:00:46.227 --> 01:00:49.688]  We see massive persecution against the press, against whistleblowers.
[01:00:51.668 --> 01:00:55.549]  We see massive establishment media demonization of Infowars.com.
[01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:03.051]  And it's because of you, the listeners, who are empowered and taking action.
[01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:03.551]  Keep it up.
[01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:05.732]  It's beautiful.
[01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:08.912]  Congressman Jones was going to be on right now.
[01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:10.513]  He wants to come on after Boehner's statement.
[01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:11.833]  Has Boehner come out to make a statement yet?
[01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:14.652]  Not yet, we're waiting.
[01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:17.274]  Alright, the minute the live feed comes, just take over and put him on.
[01:01:17.294 --> 01:01:29.165]  Of course, this morning at about 7 o'clock central, because I was online doing research right when it popped up on DrudgeReport.com, House Speaker John Boehner to resign from Congress in October.
[01:01:29.605 --> 01:01:32.207]  Boehner has been a congressman for three decades.
[01:01:32.688 --> 01:01:37.893]  Now they want to try to organize, because the neocons are losing strength fast, and the rhinos.
[01:01:39.246 --> 01:01:42.207]  To put a successor just as bad as him in.
[01:01:42.307 --> 01:01:44.288]  So, that's the big fat fight.
[01:01:44.908 --> 01:01:47.929]  Boehner went on to say, there's nothing left to accomplish.
[01:01:47.949 --> 01:01:49.369]  Yeah, I guess Obamacare's in.
[01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:51.830]  Power plants are shut down.
[01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:53.711]  Borders are wide open.
[01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:55.551]  ISIS is running wild.
[01:01:57.852 --> 01:02:00.313]  The gender tranny bathrooms are going in.
[01:02:01.553 --> 01:02:02.934]  The media is promoting pedophilia.
[01:02:05.731 --> 01:02:08.091]  Caitlyn Jenner's Woman of the Year.
[01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:09.372]  I mean, just everything's wonderful.
[01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:13.232]  Isn't that just special?
[01:02:14.233 --> 01:02:15.173]  Isn't that just sweet?
[01:02:15.213 --> 01:02:16.293]  Isn't that just darling?
[01:02:18.053 --> 01:02:23.074]  I want to, again, go to break here in a moment and come back with Boehner's statement that's set to happen any moment.
[01:02:24.194 --> 01:02:33.616]  And then we have cars from Walter Jones coming on who spearheaded the movement under massive attack from inside the Republican Party and from without with the Democrats.
[01:02:36.826 --> 01:02:41.170]  To destroy him.
[01:02:43.431 --> 01:02:50.757]  And that's the reason they're coming after the Tea Party, is because we've got a real shot at curing the globalist disease.
[01:02:50.797 --> 01:02:51.798]  The Tea Party isn't perfect.
[01:02:51.818 --> 01:02:53.019]  The Republicans have tried to take it over.
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.162]  They weren't fully capable of doing that, weren't fully successful.
[01:02:57.543 --> 01:02:59.785]  Every time they'd take one group over, another would just pop up.
[01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:03.448]  And so now, they're killing it from every different angle, and it's still not working.
[01:03:04.252 --> 01:03:10.554]  And so now they're just going after myself, Dinesh D'Souza, Patriot Governors, Patriot Attorney Generals around the country.
[01:03:12.595 --> 01:03:15.416]  The Texas Attorney General was fighting Obama on every front.
[01:03:17.216 --> 01:03:20.737]  And so they just had their minion Democrats at the state level indicting him for nothing.
[01:03:21.337 --> 01:03:26.119]  Being at dinner and telling folks about what he thought a good investment was and not disclosing at dinner.
[01:03:27.551 --> 01:03:30.433]  I wonder who he's having dinner with, that he was involved with the company.
[01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:38.860]  I mean, that's the type of crazy town stuff, while the White House does stuff 5,000 times, 10,000 times worse, literally.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.683]  And let's just say it's illegal what he did.
[01:03:42.983 --> 01:03:45.205]  You could twist some interpretation of that out.
[01:03:46.446 --> 01:03:47.727]  He says he's politically motivated.
[01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:49.748]  We told you about it before it even happened.
[01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:56.674]  It's just crazy.
[01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:04.980]  It's absolutely crazy how out of control this whole country and this whole world has gotten.
[01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:09.942]  And the globalists are making their move right now because they're scared.
[01:04:10.283 --> 01:04:13.424]  I never even, in the whole last hour, even skipped a break.
[01:04:13.444 --> 01:04:14.184]  I gotta quit doing that.
[01:04:17.166 --> 01:04:18.266]  I didn't even plug anything.
[01:04:18.727 --> 01:04:26.971]  It's absolutely imperative that you understand that they hate what we do because it's effective and it's absolutely imperative you understand that it costs a massive amount of money
[01:04:28.012 --> 01:04:42.782]  To have the radio, TV satellites, the crew, the writers, the editors, the insurance, the customer service, the researchers, the investigative journalists, the camera people, just the list goes on and on, the lawyers to run this operation.
[01:04:43.103 --> 01:04:46.225]  We do it on the cheaps, but it's still very expensive.
[01:04:46.645 --> 01:04:48.706]  We need to be strong in the face of these attacks.
[01:04:49.187 --> 01:04:53.350]  We need to be well-fed, well-trained going into this big battle with the globalists.
[01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:56.472]  So I want to thank you all for your support, your prayers, most importantly.
[01:04:56.832 --> 01:05:07.472]  And ask you to visit InfoWarsTore.com today and check out the amazing products and great prices and shop with the good guys and help reload us for the next round with the New World Order.
[01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:11.875]  You've heard of Clock Kid, right?
[01:05:11.955 --> 01:05:16.696]  The boy who removed the insides of a digital clock, put it in a suitcase, then brought it to school to show his teachers.
[01:05:16.836 --> 01:05:22.037]  When people got suspicious, he claimed he didn't know anything, refused to talk to police, then gets invited to the White House.
[01:05:22.297 --> 01:05:22.917]  Well, get ready.
[01:05:23.077 --> 01:05:24.738]  Now we have Pope Kid.
[01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:25.378]  That's right.
[01:05:25.538 --> 01:05:33.399]  The Daily Mail reports five-year-old daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope after breaking through security barricades hours after he says mass in Spanish.
[01:05:33.659 --> 01:05:37.420]  Sofia Cruz was part of a crowd of thousands lining the papal route in Washington, D.C.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.680]  to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.601]  As he passed, she got over police barricades and ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the Pope-mobile.
[01:05:43.721 --> 01:05:47.182]  She happened to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that read, Pope Rescue DAPA.
[01:05:47.362 --> 01:05:49.262]  So the legalization would be your blessing.
[01:05:49.442 --> 01:05:52.963]  Makes you wonder, with all this security theater around, how a five-year-old could get through.
[01:05:52.983 --> 01:05:55.063]  Hmm, maybe it's staged.
[01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:58.424]  Of course every five-year-old's got a letter ready and a t-shirt printed up.
[01:05:58.584 --> 01:05:59.724]  Nothing weird about that.
[01:05:59.925 --> 01:06:00.805]  Back to the clock kid.
[01:06:00.865 --> 01:06:04.506]  Did you know his sister was suspended for reportedly threatening to blow up the school?
[01:06:04.726 --> 01:06:06.546]  Hmm, now it all becomes clearer.
[01:06:06.826 --> 01:06:10.028]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:17.611]  Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to be able to bring you the hands-down best deal we've ever offered on high-quality storable foods.
[01:06:17.931 --> 01:06:31.558]  InfoWarsStore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest, longest-lasting, most affordable storable foods at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[01:06:31.718 --> 01:06:34.199]  My goal is to find the best deals and bring it to you.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:41.604]  For a limited time until October 1st, they're allowing us to offer the lowest price on food they've ever given to the public.
[01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:48.028]  Now is the time, in the next week, to take action and to secure your pantry for any emergency.
[01:06:48.168 --> 01:06:51.890]  Visit InfoWarsSelect.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:52.510]  I want more candy!
[01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:53.291]  I want my baby again!
[01:06:53.311 --> 01:06:53.571]  My, my, my!
[01:07:13.559 --> 01:07:22.946]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[01:07:23.286 --> 01:07:25.888]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[01:07:25.988 --> 01:07:29.371]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:35.575]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:40.719]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:40.999 --> 01:07:47.163]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[01:07:47.383 --> 01:07:54.848]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[01:07:55.108 --> 01:08:02.392]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.
[01:08:02.672 --> 01:08:06.095]  Obtain your ChildEase today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:06.275 --> 01:08:09.216]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:13.539 --> 01:08:19.561]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:20.161 --> 01:08:23.201]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.221 --> 01:08:26.342]  All right, Boner is speaking, resigning, stepping down.
[01:08:26.422 --> 01:08:27.482]  Here it is, C-SPAN.
[01:08:28.263 --> 01:08:30.443]  That will help our children and their children.
[01:08:31.443 --> 01:08:36.725]  We're now on track to cut government spending by 2.1 trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
[01:08:37.245 --> 01:08:37.905]  They always say that.
[01:08:37.965 --> 01:08:41.266]  We've made the first real entitlement reform in nearly two decades.
[01:08:42.236 --> 01:08:46.019]  And we've protected 99% of the American people from an increase in our taxes.
[01:08:46.419 --> 01:08:47.300]  He's gonna say mission accomplished.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.601]  And we've done all this with a Democrat in the White House.
[01:08:50.642 --> 01:08:52.343]  So I'm proud of what we've accomplished.
[01:08:53.544 --> 01:08:57.867]  But more than anything, my first job as Speaker is to protect the institution.
[01:08:58.487 --> 01:08:58.587]  Oh!
[01:08:59.208 --> 01:09:05.032]  A lot of you know that, now know, that my plan was to step down at the end of last year.
[01:09:05.992 --> 01:09:06.553]  I decided
[01:09:08.355 --> 01:09:10.337]  This is face-saving, he's been driven out.
[01:09:26.983 --> 01:09:27.243]  I think?
[01:09:47.186 --> 01:09:50.067]  Would do irreparable harm to the institution.
[01:09:50.107 --> 01:09:51.248]  Wow, he's being halfway honest!
[01:09:51.308 --> 01:09:57.750]  So this morning I informed my colleagues that I would resign from the Speakership and resign from Congress at the end of October.
[01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:02.672]  Now, as you've often heard me say, this isn't about me.
[01:10:03.672 --> 01:10:05.793]  It's about the people, it's about the institution.
[01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:09.254]  No, the leadership battle exposes what a traitor you are.
[01:10:09.594 --> 01:10:10.354]  With your other leadership.
[01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:14.456]  Pope Francis addressing the greatest legislative body in the world.
[01:10:15.632 --> 01:10:20.676]  And I hope that we will all heed his call to live by the golden rule.
[01:10:20.957 --> 01:10:21.657]  Oh my gosh.
[01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:24.159]  But last night I started thinking about this.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:29.243]  And this morning I woke up and I said my prayers as I always do.
[01:10:29.263 --> 01:10:29.684]  Pure bold.
[01:10:29.744 --> 01:10:32.466]  And I decided, you know, today's the day I'm going to do this.
[01:10:33.087 --> 01:10:34.127]  As simple as that.
[01:10:35.509 --> 01:10:37.070]  That's the code I've always lived by.
[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:40.693]  If you do the right things for the right reasons, good things will happen.
[01:10:42.108 --> 01:10:48.693]  And I know good things lie ahead for this house, in this country, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished, especially proud of my team.
[01:10:49.093 --> 01:10:50.615]  It's a rat beating a sinking ship.
[01:10:50.715 --> 01:11:01.103]  I've been here my 25th year here, and I've succeeded in large part because I put a staff together, and a team together, many of which have been with me for a long time.
[01:11:02.023 --> 01:11:07.788]  And without a great staff, you can't be a great member, and you certainly can't be a great speaker.
[01:11:08.775 --> 01:11:12.398]  I'm going to thank my family for putting up with this all these years.
[01:11:12.418 --> 01:11:15.280]  They have wheelbarrows of tissues.
[01:11:16.401 --> 01:11:21.104]  Their first campaign photo was in July of 1981.
[01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:26.829]  And so they've had to endure all this.
[01:11:26.909 --> 01:11:28.850]  It's one thing for me to endure it.
[01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:29.791]  I've got thick skin.
[01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:35.155]  But, you know, the girls in my life, they've had to put up with a lot over the years.
[01:11:36.987 --> 01:11:38.067]  He's using them as a shield.
[01:11:38.087 --> 01:11:49.991]  Let me express my gratitude to my constituents who've sent me here 13 times over the last 25 years.
[01:11:50.971 --> 01:11:53.192]  You can't get here without getting votes.
[01:11:54.212 --> 01:12:04.575]  I've said this often, people ask me, what's the greatest thing about being Speaker or about being an elected official?
[01:12:05.231 --> 01:12:06.852]  And I said, what's the people you get to meet?
[01:12:07.512 --> 01:12:14.514]  You know, I've met tens of thousands of people in my own congressional district that I would never have met, other than the fact that I decided to run for Congress.
[01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:23.537]  And over the years as I've traveled on behalf of my colleagues in the party, I've met tens of thousands of additional people all over the country.
[01:12:24.637 --> 01:12:30.579]  And you meet rich people, you meet poor people, you meet interesting people, and probably a few boring ones along the way.
[01:12:31.628 --> 01:12:43.735]  But I can tell you that 99.9% of the people I meet on the road, anywhere, could not be nicer than they've been.
[01:12:43.915 --> 01:12:46.817]  It's been, really it's been wonderful.
[01:12:47.717 --> 01:12:53.040]  It's been an honor to serve in this institution.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:56.322]  And with that, alright Junior, go ahead.
[01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:01.445]  Really?
[01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:03.286]  What a surprise!
[01:13:04.707 --> 01:13:10.752]  There was a standing ovation at a Values Voters Summit as Rubio announced Boehner's resignation.
[01:13:10.772 --> 01:13:12.573]  There's video of that from C-SPAN.
[01:13:12.633 --> 01:13:13.754]  Yesterday was a wonderful day.
[01:13:13.774 --> 01:13:14.294]  It really was.
[01:13:14.655 --> 01:13:16.716]  And was I emotional yesterday?
[01:13:17.096 --> 01:13:17.697]  I think I was.
[01:13:20.199 --> 01:13:23.441]  I was really emotional in a moment that really no one saw.
[01:13:27.432 --> 01:13:29.552]  The Pope and I were getting ready to exit the building.
[01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:30.193]  Oh no.
[01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:31.973]  We found ourselves alone.
[01:13:33.253 --> 01:13:40.454]  And the Pope grabbed my left arm and said some very kind words to me about my commitment.
[01:13:41.395 --> 01:13:42.635]  Oh my gosh, you should start crying.
[01:13:44.015 --> 01:13:44.695]  Put it back on screen.
[01:13:44.715 --> 01:13:46.215]  To kids and education.
[01:13:46.475 --> 01:13:47.936]  Oh, he's completely mentally ill.
[01:13:48.396 --> 01:13:54.557]  And the Pope puts his arm around me and kind of pulls me to him and says, please pray for me.
[01:13:55.994 --> 01:13:58.135]  Well, who am I to pray for the Pope?
[01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:00.015]  The Marxist Pope?
[01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:03.196]  He's called us egomaniacs.
[01:14:04.496 --> 01:14:05.937]  Listen, it was never about the vote.
[01:14:05.997 --> 01:14:09.118]  He's crying because he's on such a power trip.
[01:14:09.338 --> 01:14:11.678]  I don't want my members to have to go through this.
[01:14:12.439 --> 01:14:14.339]  I certainly don't want the institution to go through this.
[01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:17.620]  He's got the tissue out!
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.241]  I'm just thinking about walking out the door anyway.
[01:14:20.521 --> 01:14:22.941]  I get a tear in my eye talking about aborted babies.
[01:14:22.981 --> 01:14:23.622]  This guy's just like...
[01:14:25.582 --> 01:14:31.808]  Mr. Speaker, I've heard you say before that a leader who doesn't have anybody following him is just a guy taking a walk.
[01:14:32.609 --> 01:14:33.309]  That's right.
[01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:44.379]  I got plenty of people following me, but this turmoil that's been churning now for a couple of months, it's not good for the members and it's not good for the institution.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:51.546]  And if I wasn't planning on leaving here soon, I can tell you I would not have done it.
[01:14:52.119 --> 01:15:05.586]  If I may just say, this continues, there are people who are on the right in your caucus and even outside of this institution who have been wanting you to step down for some time who feel that they have a victory today.
[01:15:05.606 --> 01:15:07.547]  Do you feel that you were pushed out?
[01:15:07.727 --> 01:15:08.308]  No.
[01:15:08.328 --> 01:15:16.032]  The members... I'm glad I made this announcement at the conference with all my Republican colleagues.
[01:15:16.072 --> 01:15:21.455]  Because it was a very good moment to help kind of rebuild the team.
[01:15:22.565 --> 01:15:25.547]  Listen, I feel good about what I've done.
[01:15:27.247 --> 01:15:33.190]  I know that I, every day, I've tried to do the right things for the right reasons, and tried to do the right thing for the country.
[01:15:42.321 --> 01:15:45.523]  I'm going to be here for another five weeks and I'm not going to leave.
[01:15:58.372 --> 01:16:00.635]  I'm not going to sit around here and do nothing for the next 30 days.
[01:16:00.655 --> 01:16:03.157]  There's a lot of work that needs to be done, and I... Oh yeah.
[01:16:03.177 --> 01:16:05.679]  I plan on getting as much of it done as I can.
[01:16:05.719 --> 01:16:17.071]  Like protecting Obama from all his crimes, keeping Obamacare in, keeping the abortion going, blocking the abortion ban votes, doing all the evil things you do, and making sure one of your minions gets in.
[01:16:17.711 --> 01:16:19.092]  I would have made, regardless of this.
[01:16:19.132 --> 01:16:21.693]  There's now an all-out leadership scramble happening.
[01:16:21.713 --> 01:16:22.834]  Had you just had enough?
[01:16:22.894 --> 01:16:25.255]  And how will anything be different?
[01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:26.355]  No, let me tell you.
[01:16:26.455 --> 01:16:29.477]  I would not describe it as having had enough.
[01:16:29.517 --> 01:16:30.217]  That's not it at all.
[01:16:46.638 --> 01:16:50.542]  When you're the Speaker of the House, you can't move the ball down the road for the New World Order anymore.
[01:16:50.602 --> 01:16:54.285]  You're a symbol of evil, just like the Attorney General was.
[01:16:54.425 --> 01:16:59.349]  And having a vote like this in the institution, I don't think is very healthy.
[01:17:00.170 --> 01:17:06.056]  And so I've done everything I can over my term as Speaker to strengthen the institution.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:13.603]  And frankly, my move today is another step in that effort to strengthen the institution.
[01:17:13.623 --> 01:17:14.903]  But won't the next Speaker say something?
[01:17:14.923 --> 01:17:16.244]  They've totally sold out the Congress.
[01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:16.664]  Hopefully not.
[01:17:17.544 --> 01:17:18.845]  That's my question, Mr. Speaker.
[01:17:19.065 --> 01:17:22.566]  How will Washington be different because you leave this institution?
[01:17:23.567 --> 01:17:28.869]  What should people watching this expect the House and Congress to do going forward if you're not here?
[01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:36.974]  If the Congress stays focused on the American people's priorities, there will be no problem at all.
[01:17:38.336 --> 01:17:45.847]  And while we have differences between Democrats and Republicans, the goal here as one of the leaders is to find the common ground.
[01:17:46.806 --> 01:17:51.029]  Listen, I talked to... Yeah, foreign banks want triple prices of health care and cut quality?
[01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:52.550]  You help ram it through and protect it?
[01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:57.434]  ...leaders, who I have a very good relationship with... Planned Parenthood wants to sell eight-month-old babies?
[01:17:57.494 --> 01:17:59.195]  ...the leaders have to be able to... Chop them up?
[01:17:59.215 --> 01:17:59.856]  Sell their organs?
[01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:00.496]  You protect it?
[01:18:01.437 --> 01:18:03.419]  ...to find the common ground and get things done.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:07.761]  Get things done!
[01:18:07.961 --> 01:18:10.243]  I can't listen to any more of this.
[01:18:10.303 --> 01:18:12.444]  We'll come back to some of it after the break.
[01:18:12.944 --> 01:18:18.347]  I just want to remind listeners that the Tea Party is under attack from this guy and the Democrats.
[01:18:18.867 --> 01:18:26.191]  They hate the Libertarian movement and the Republican Party because they know it's popular, it's constitutional, it's a counter to what they're doing.
[01:18:27.072 --> 01:18:30.014]  That's why I want to encourage all of you out there
[01:18:31.158 --> 01:18:36.103]  To visit InfoWarsLife.com today and find some of the best nutraceutical supplements out there.

[01:18:37.645 --> 01:18:39.327]  We've sold out of Super Mel Vitality.
[01:18:40.472 --> 01:18:48.977]  We got a small shipment in of Super Female Vitality, but in my case, Dr. Group talks about this, it works better for some men.
[01:18:49.397 --> 01:18:52.519]  It's just got a few added herbs that supposedly are more tailored to women.
[01:18:53.099 --> 01:18:55.461]  It's got all the same stuff that the men's has.
[01:18:56.001 --> 01:18:58.683]  Just check it out at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:18:59.123 --> 01:19:02.325]  If you didn't get a chance to get Super Female Vitality or the Super Female sold out,

[01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:18.027]  Also, Survival Shield Nacin Iodine, the good halogen X tube, is available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:18.288 --> 01:19:19.289]  That is going to sell out.
[01:19:19.309 --> 01:19:20.670]  It could be months until we get more.

[01:19:54.016 --> 01:19:55.477]  The globalists want to shut us down.
[01:19:55.958 --> 01:20:00.361]  Your answer to that is spreading the word, praying for us, and buying the products.
[01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:01.142]  And I know you will.
[01:20:01.462 --> 01:20:02.002]  So thank you.
[01:20:02.062 --> 01:20:02.723]  I salute you.
[01:20:03.123 --> 01:20:05.345]  It's now time to double down and defend the press.
[01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:10.329]  It's under attack because the enemy is in trouble and they're counter-offensive right now.

[01:21:15.694 --> 01:21:19.455]  And the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[01:21:19.715 --> 01:21:24.897]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[01:21:25.177 --> 01:21:29.798]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[01:21:30.078 --> 01:21:33.299]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[01:21:33.599 --> 01:21:35.700]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[01:22:10.054 --> 01:22:13.556]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:14.796]  It's true.
[01:22:14.916 --> 01:22:18.878]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:19.058 --> 01:22:20.899]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:21.439 --> 01:22:25.941]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:33.605]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA.

[01:23:10.743 --> 01:23:12.125]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowicz.
[01:23:12.565 --> 01:23:14.547]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:23:15.088 --> 01:23:18.752]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[01:23:18.972 --> 01:23:27.461]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[01:23:27.782 --> 01:23:31.065]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:23:31.926 --> 01:23:35.010]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:39.675]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:23:40.436 --> 01:23:44.660]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[01:23:45.361 --> 01:23:48.164]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:23:48.525 --> 01:23:50.767]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:23:51.608 --> 01:23:57.855]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[01:23:58.636 --> 01:24:03.901]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:05.923]  It is as though the protection is free.
[01:24:06.604 --> 01:24:08.225]  Visit idstronghold.com today.
[01:24:14.016 --> 01:24:20.240]  Boehner is still up there babbling at his announcement that he's going to resign at the end of October from the Speakership of the House of Representatives.
[01:24:20.921 --> 01:24:29.146]  Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina that publicly spearheaded the takedown of Boehner is going to be joining us at the start of the next segment.
[01:24:30.267 --> 01:24:38.693]  Marco Rubio announced at a conservative function this morning that Boehner was going to be stepping down to applause.
[01:24:39.253 --> 01:24:41.975]  This is him posing like he's on a rhino too.
[01:24:43.732 --> 01:24:50.467]  Marco Rubio is just as bad as John Boehner with his voting record, his flip-flopping, his open borders promotion.
[01:24:50.547 --> 01:24:54.014]  I mean, with Republicans like this, who needs Democrats?
[01:24:57.597 --> 01:24:59.818]  And this is why we're in so much trouble.
[01:25:00.359 --> 01:25:01.959]  And then his worship of the Marxist Pope.
[01:25:01.979 --> 01:25:09.023]  And by the way, last night I was listening to a local station that was rearing some of my show and I heard myself calling the Pope a scumbag and stuff.
[01:25:09.624 --> 01:25:17.588]  I don't apologize to the Pope for saying that, but I need to be more respectful because there's a lot of good people that are Catholics who are very hurt by what this Pope's doing.
[01:25:18.408 --> 01:25:20.009]  And I don't want to sound gleeful about it.
[01:25:20.089 --> 01:25:21.290]  I'm actually nauseous.
[01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:22.551]  I'm upset.
[01:25:24.047 --> 01:25:30.750]  I've never attacked the Catholic Church or our Popes because I thought what they stood for, I really couldn't criticize.
[01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:32.271]  It's like Pontius Pilate.
[01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:37.173]  I find no fault here when people are pro-life, anti-communist, you know, anti-Soviet Union.
[01:25:37.213 --> 01:25:40.434]  And I know there was infiltration and problems and I get it.
[01:25:40.915 --> 01:25:42.075]  There's been a long slide.
[01:25:42.795 --> 01:25:45.877]  It's just that it really freaks me out to see a Pope
[01:25:46.889 --> 01:25:50.651]  With hardcore Marxism, eugenics, you know, you can't have air conditioning.
[01:25:51.571 --> 01:25:53.152]  That's a death sentence to the third world.
[01:25:53.472 --> 01:25:55.813]  But I'm going to be more professional about it.
[01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:57.354]  Not because anybody complained.
[01:25:57.374 --> 01:25:59.035]  Everybody loves the fact that I'm bashing him.
[01:26:00.975 --> 01:26:02.016]  I don't like how it sounded.
[01:26:04.977 --> 01:26:06.298]  It's just, it's so sick.
[01:26:07.999 --> 01:26:08.599]  It's so sick.
[01:26:09.159 --> 01:26:12.641]  Here is Rubio making the announcement on Boehner, who's still giving his press conference.
[01:26:14.315 --> 01:26:15.616]  And we'll see how things progress.
[01:26:16.216 --> 01:26:19.498]  Just a few minutes ago, Speaker Boehner announced that he will be resigning.
[01:26:27.642 --> 01:26:30.423]  If people are not there to see Rubio, it's a conservative summit.
[01:26:38.271 --> 01:26:40.273]  The standing ovation goes on and on and on.
[01:26:40.693 --> 01:26:48.860]  Let's go back to his lordship, John Boehner, here for a minute to see what his excellency, I say that because every time I hear it, the U.N.
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:50.862]  There he is walking out, he's leaving.
[01:26:51.983 --> 01:26:54.044]  Let's turn up the audio here as we watch C-SPAN.
[01:26:54.084 --> 01:26:56.226]  Speaker Boehner, well, I really do.
[01:26:58.068 --> 01:27:02.171]  And he has served our nation to the utmost and I am very pleased
[01:27:03.610 --> 01:27:08.495]  That he was handled very well at the news conference.
[01:27:08.655 --> 01:27:10.637]  I'm glad nobody picked on him or anything.
[01:27:10.657 --> 01:27:11.958]  Oh, nobody picked on him.
[01:27:11.978 --> 01:27:13.559]  Because he cries all the time.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.904]  It's okay, he keeps the abortion going, because he cries a lot, little teddy bear.
[01:27:17.924 --> 01:27:19.565]  Well, that's a Schmitz-Holland act.
[01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:31.771]  He'll probably still indict him down the road just to scare everybody.
[01:27:31.791 --> 01:27:35.712]  I can't listen to any more of it.
[01:27:35.772 --> 01:27:39.193]  Turn that person off, please.
[01:27:39.213 --> 01:27:42.054]  That's some mummy up there doing the interviews.
[01:27:43.074 --> 01:27:44.235]  I'm sorry, I shouldn't be mean.
[01:27:44.295 --> 01:27:45.615]  I'm turning into Donald Trump here.
[01:27:45.895 --> 01:27:46.815]  Sure, it's a great reporter.
[01:27:46.835 --> 01:27:47.395]  I don't know.
[01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:49.476]  I just can't handle it.
[01:27:53.114 --> 01:27:56.017]  There's a headline conservatives warned his deputy McCarthy.
[01:27:56.817 --> 01:27:59.600]  We don't... he was... he was the deputy of Newt Gingrich.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:00.500]  John Boehner was.
[01:28:01.181 --> 01:28:01.842]  That's his real name.
[01:28:02.122 --> 01:28:03.443]  So be proud of your German name, buddy.
[01:28:05.445 --> 01:28:09.468]  And... if your name's Schmitt, it's not Schmitzer.
[01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:15.013]  Or if your name is Gruber, it's not Gobbler.
[01:28:16.535 --> 01:28:17.435]  Your name's Boehner.
[01:28:19.057 --> 01:28:20.058]  And the point is...
[01:28:21.806 --> 01:28:27.534]  That now they're trying to put his deputy in, and we're going to have...
[01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:30.389]  Congressman Jones joining us.
[01:28:31.069 --> 01:28:34.030]  I'm plugging twice this hour because I didn't plug any last hour.
[01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:36.590]  We got a lot of bills to pay around here and these are high-quality products.
[01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:55.374]  You know the globalists are attacking us or demonizing us, are going after Patriot Press, the Tea Party, thousands of Tea Party groups harassed, audited, indicted, filmmakers arrested, indicted, set up, and we've had multiple sources that I've put together in the last year from inside the government
[01:28:55.954 --> 01:28:56.434]  We're good to go.
[01:29:18.632 --> 01:29:20.133]  Doesn't matter we haven't done anything wrong.
[01:29:20.514 --> 01:29:31.703]  These people have shown, it's been proven, that they will frame you, they will set you up, or they will confuse you into saying something that's incorrect, so they can try to then charge you for making false statements to the FBI.
[01:29:32.023 --> 01:29:35.906]  That's why if the FBI ever comes around here, and they've been here before, I just say, give me your subpoena.
[01:29:36.247 --> 01:29:37.227]  Here's the info you want.
[01:29:37.628 --> 01:29:39.629]  Somebody making death threats once on a forum.
[01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:41.830]  And I'm not talking to you.
[01:29:42.771 --> 01:29:44.111]  So, talk to the hand.
[01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:46.351]  That's what you can be expecting.
[01:29:47.212 --> 01:29:56.974]  But anyways, we have a lot of high quality products available at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and Super Female Vitality is back in stock for a limited time.
[01:29:57.934 --> 01:29:59.634]  A small amount of that is available.
[01:30:00.134 --> 01:30:01.015]  We're on the march.
[01:30:01.515 --> 01:30:03.115]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:04.035 --> 01:30:06.716]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.683 --> 01:30:11.924]  You've heard of Clock Kid, right?
[01:30:12.024 --> 01:30:16.765]  The boy who removed the insides of a digital clock, put it in a suitcase, then brought it to school to show his teachers.
[01:30:16.905 --> 01:30:22.107]  When people got suspicious, he claimed he didn't know anything, refused to talk to police, then gets invited to the White House.
[01:30:22.348 --> 01:30:22.988]  Well, get ready.
[01:30:23.148 --> 01:30:24.809]  Now we have Pope Kid!
[01:30:25.029 --> 01:30:25.449]  That's right.
[01:30:25.589 --> 01:30:33.452]  The Daily Mail reports, five-year-old daughter of illegal immigrants is blessed by Pope after breaking through security barricades hours after he says mass in Spanish.
[01:30:33.732 --> 01:30:37.493]  Sofia Cruz was part of a crowd of thousands lining the paparazzi in Washington, D.C.
[01:30:37.513 --> 01:30:38.754]  to catch a glimpse of the pontiff.
[01:30:38.974 --> 01:30:43.678]  As he passed, she got over police barricades and ran out into the street in an attempt to approach the Pope-mobile.
[01:30:43.778 --> 01:30:47.261]  She happened to have a letter and a yellow t-shirt that read Pope Rescue DAPA.
[01:30:47.421 --> 01:30:49.343]  So the legalization would be your blessing.
[01:30:49.503 --> 01:30:53.026]  Makes you wonder, with all this security theater around, how a five-year-old could get through.
[01:30:53.046 --> 01:30:55.107]  Hmm, maybe it's staged.
[01:30:55.448 --> 01:30:58.490]  Of course every five-year-old's got a letter ready and a t-shirt printed up.
[01:30:58.650 --> 01:30:59.791]  Nothing weird about that.
[01:31:00.011 --> 01:31:00.872]  Back to the clock kid.
[01:31:00.932 --> 01:31:04.575]  Did you know his sister was suspended for reportedly threatening to blow up the school?
[01:31:04.795 --> 01:31:06.617]  Hmm, now it all becomes clearer.
[01:31:06.877 --> 01:31:10.079]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:31:10.579 --> 01:31:14.682]  Many of the products at InfoWarsLife.com are true game changers.
[01:31:14.882 --> 01:31:19.085]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:31:19.145 --> 01:31:26.410]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:31:26.590 --> 01:31:37.093]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:31:37.253 --> 01:31:40.594]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:31:40.774 --> 01:31:41.794]  What do you have to lose?
[01:31:41.914 --> 01:31:50.196]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:31:50.336 --> 01:31:53.560]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:57.684]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.967]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:32:00.167 --> 01:32:07.135]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:32:10.499 --> 01:32:17.444]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[01:33:28.712 --> 01:33:32.220]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:32.761 --> 01:33:34.746]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.945 --> 01:33:50.006]  Monday through Friday we're here live 11 a.m.
[01:33:50.046 --> 01:33:50.506]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:50.566 --> 01:33:52.847]  Central back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:53.627 --> 01:34:07.851]  We have seen an unprecedented war on the free press and on whistleblowers even Democrat top constitutional lawyers like Jonathan Turley have said Obama is three times worse than any president they've ever seen or read about or heard about.
[01:34:09.005 --> 01:34:10.706]  We have an attack on the family.
[01:34:10.766 --> 01:34:13.007]  We have an attack on our sovereignty, our borders.
[01:34:13.548 --> 01:34:16.269]  We have our own government caught funding ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:34:16.589 --> 01:34:20.292]  Even the head of Defense Intelligence quit and went public a month and a half ago.
[01:34:20.312 --> 01:34:25.575]  The deputy head of the CIA went public two weeks ago on CBS News.
[01:34:26.755 --> 01:34:30.818]  So the good news is there are good people in government telling the truth.
[01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:34.580]  The bad news is the corrupt elements are doubling and tripling down.
[01:34:35.916 --> 01:34:43.441]  Now it was back in August, we'll put the article up on screen, that we interviewed Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina.
[01:34:44.061 --> 01:34:46.123]  We interviewed him on August 15th.
[01:35:05.896 --> 01:35:11.505]  You in part led this dangerous operation because they target you and come after you when you do this.
[01:35:12.841 --> 01:35:16.143]  He of course then announced he will resign at the end of October today.
[01:35:16.503 --> 01:35:18.904]  And the big question is, what precipitated this?
[01:35:19.304 --> 01:35:20.865]  Was it the Vacate the Chair movement?
[01:35:21.165 --> 01:35:24.346]  He basically admitted today that internal battles forced him to do this.
[01:35:24.907 --> 01:35:25.827]  What comes next?
[01:35:25.887 --> 01:35:38.233]  Who does Congressman Jones think should be the real conservative, patriot, constitutionalist to lead the Republican Congress and challenge President Obama?
[01:35:38.273 --> 01:35:40.334]  Boehner said five times that I saw him.
[01:35:40.894 --> 01:35:49.678]  In the press conference that just ended, ten minutes ago, that he strengthened the House and strengthened the Speakership, that of course is obviously not true.
[01:35:49.898 --> 01:35:52.420]  So joining us is Congressman Walter Jones.
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:53.960]  Congressman, thank you so much.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.202]  We've won a big battle, but not the war.
[01:35:57.242 --> 01:36:02.405]  Alex, you're exactly right, and thank you for having me on your show in mid-August to talk about this issue.
[01:36:02.625 --> 01:36:09.408]  And, no, this is an opportunity, and I hope, and I know you will, but I hope other conservative talk show hosts
[01:36:09.912 --> 01:36:17.537]  We'll pick up the drumsticks and start beating the drum to get a conservative speaker in the House of Representatives.
[01:36:17.617 --> 01:36:19.078]  We're going to have an opportunity.
[01:36:19.658 --> 01:36:25.462]  It's not going to be easy, but we're going to have an opportunity to get the right person in that chair.
[01:36:26.263 --> 01:36:31.006]  And I anticipate next week when we go back, I'm in the Liberty Caucus, as you well know,
[01:36:31.567 --> 01:36:33.208]  We also have the Freedom Caucus.
[01:36:33.428 --> 01:36:40.093]  If you combine the Liberty Caucus and the Freedom Caucus, that's about 65 or 70 members who are basically conservative.
[01:36:40.973 --> 01:36:42.554]  This will be our opportunity.
[01:36:43.015 --> 01:36:44.956]  But we need to push from outside.
[01:36:45.756 --> 01:36:47.818]  Don't let this just be an inside battle.
[01:36:48.378 --> 01:37:00.466]  Let the outside forces who help us reach this victory today, to let their voices be heard by calling their members of Congress and tell them, for goodness sakes, let's get a man of principle
[01:37:00.954 --> 01:37:10.912]  In the speaker's chair, or a woman, a principal, who will not cut deals to raise the debt ceiling, will not cut deals to spend money overseas that we don't have.
[01:37:13.632 --> 01:37:30.528]  Well, I'm just speechless because your focused, simple words still are so important and so crystal that we have a chance to really try to get a good Speaker of the House in there that is basically as powerful as the President.
[01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:52.666]  If they exercise their power instead of being lapdogs, and we could really turn this country around, the entire power structure, both RINO and Democrat, has been focusing its energies on destroying the Tea Party and stopping a libertarian conservative rebellion in the House to try to take control of the Congress away from the establishment.
[01:37:52.686 --> 01:37:55.208]  And we, I think, are very close to doing that.
[01:37:55.749 --> 01:37:58.371]  Being up there on the Hill, sir, and being an expert on this,
[01:37:59.111 --> 01:38:08.454]  What do you think the strategy is, the winning strategy, to be able to try to checkmate Obama at a time where he's just operating like a dictator?
[01:38:09.434 --> 01:38:18.297]  Well, Alex, as you know and I know, before we had the vote for the Speaker of the House in January of 2015, I was one of 25 to vote no on John Boehner.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:29.486]  You and other talk show hosts, you were beating the drum that I called about just a moment ago to call for that drumbeat again.
[01:38:30.287 --> 01:38:33.970]  We're going to have, Bainer will be in office until the end of October.
[01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:40.376]  We're going to have a CR coming up and most of us hope that we defund Planned Parenthood.
[01:38:40.436 --> 01:38:50.324]  I don't know what will be in the continuing resolution known as a CR next week, but I will tell you this, we are going to have an opportunity that you do not get very often.
[01:38:51.257 --> 01:38:55.120]  And that's in the middle of a congressional session to change the leadership.
[01:38:56.140 --> 01:39:07.308]  That's why, again, I wanted to be on your show, and I would tell you that I hope that your listeners will do what they will probably very seldom have an opportunity to do.
[01:39:07.809 --> 01:39:10.390]  Change the direction of the House of Representatives.
[01:39:13.132 --> 01:39:15.274]  This is a historic moment right now.
[01:39:15.354 --> 01:39:19.557]  Who should they contact, and who are some of the people you think would be good speakers of the House?
[01:39:21.807 --> 01:39:37.079]  Alex, the reason I'm going to answer you this way is I anticipate over the weekend to have several phone calls, which I have not had yet, but I know that there are members of Congress who are testing the waters right now who are conservative.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:44.325]  I anticipate to be part of telephone conversations this weekend and certainly when I go back Monday.
[01:39:44.946 --> 01:39:47.087]  I'm looking at the TV right now.
[01:39:47.107 --> 01:39:48.949]  I met Salmon, who's a fine fellow.
[01:39:49.029 --> 01:39:50.090]  He was from Arizona.
[01:39:50.957 --> 01:39:53.098]  Uh, he ended up voting for Boehner.
[01:39:54.019 --> 01:40:02.903]  Uh, I know that since that time in August, he made the statement back in Arizona that if there was a vote to vacate the chair, he would vote to vacate the chair.
[01:40:03.723 --> 01:40:11.407]  There are plenty of conservatives who know that this is our opportunity to stop the train wreck.
[01:40:14.485 --> 01:40:17.227]  The country is being dismantled in front of us right now.
[01:40:17.307 --> 01:40:20.850]  We need a patriot in the Speakership of the House.
[01:40:22.591 --> 01:40:28.676]  Well, Alex, I'm looking at right now a Washington Post article because I want to write a letter to the editor.
[01:40:28.796 --> 01:40:29.957]  And let me read the headlines.
[01:40:30.017 --> 01:40:32.859]  I think this will be of interest to you and your listeners.
[01:40:33.399 --> 01:40:33.760]  U.S.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:36.822]  wasted billions of dollars rebuilding Afghanistan.
[01:40:38.234 --> 01:40:48.584]  Why in the world are we spending so much money, wasted money overseas, when we've got so many needs right here to rebuild America, especially in the area of infrastructure?
[01:40:49.925 --> 01:40:51.646]  That's the kind of leadership we need.
[01:40:51.727 --> 01:40:57.312]  Someone in that chair that would say to Mr. Obama, no, we're not going to raise the debt ceiling this year.
[01:40:58.072 --> 01:40:58.673]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:59.293 --> 01:41:01.876]  We raised it seven out of eight times for George Bush.
[01:41:02.822 --> 01:41:05.524]  Mr. Obama, you've been the president for six and a half years.
[01:41:05.564 --> 01:41:08.046]  You've had seven increases in the debt ceiling.
[01:41:08.407 --> 01:41:08.887]  No more.
[01:41:09.948 --> 01:41:14.251]  All that does is allow us to borrow money from foreign governments and we can't even pay it back.
[01:41:15.973 --> 01:41:18.355]  And now the foreign governments aren't borrowing the money.
[01:41:18.435 --> 01:41:20.356]  The Federal Reserve does it.
[01:41:20.416 --> 01:41:21.297]  It's just insane.
[01:41:22.958 --> 01:41:26.982]  Alex, that's why this is an opportunity that we don't get very often.
[01:41:28.122 --> 01:41:32.346]  And this opportunity is going to be driven by the people in America.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.303]  By calling their elected officials and say, get with the program.
[01:41:38.164 --> 01:41:43.589]  Give us somebody that will stand for principle to protect America.
[01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:46.691]  Well look at how we've opened the southern border.
[01:41:46.771 --> 01:41:49.093]  We advertise you can have your babies here for free.
[01:41:50.214 --> 01:41:53.116]  They pull off these stunts with anchor babies yesterday with the Pope.
[01:41:54.159 --> 01:42:00.301]  And now we have mainstream news saying it's our job to pay for everybody in the world.
[01:42:00.721 --> 01:42:02.082]  Europe's being told the same thing.
[01:42:02.442 --> 01:42:04.863]  Saudi Arabia caused a lot of the problems in Syria.
[01:42:05.123 --> 01:42:06.603]  They won't take one refugee.
[01:42:07.103 --> 01:42:10.905]  Since when is it the Western world's job to pay for everything?
[01:42:11.245 --> 01:42:12.185]  And why does D.C.
[01:42:12.225 --> 01:42:12.585]  do this?
[01:42:14.166 --> 01:42:21.168]  Because there's too much influence from, as I've said on your show many times, money drives policy.
[01:42:22.256 --> 01:42:26.658]  Policy should be driven by the people of America through their elected officials.
[01:42:28.179 --> 01:42:37.044]  This is an opportunity that we will not get every so often, and that is why we need to drive this message across this country.
[01:42:37.518 --> 01:42:41.162]  Sir, Congressman Jones again joins us if you just tuned in.
[01:42:41.303 --> 01:42:42.604]  Walter Jones, North Carolina.
[01:42:43.005 --> 01:42:45.407]  Boehner is announcing he will resign end of October.
[01:42:45.748 --> 01:42:50.693]  Congressman Jones with others have spearheaded the vacate the chair movement.
[01:42:51.214 --> 01:42:55.759]  He admitted if you just joined us in his short resignation farewell speech.
[01:42:56.783 --> 01:42:57.043]  Absolutely.
[01:42:57.063 --> 01:42:59.465]  I know, and you know, that the pressure that the Meadows
[01:43:19.887 --> 01:43:32.878]  Resolution put on the Speaker of the House and there were more and more Republicans going home listening to people like you, Alex, that came back and said, you know, if Boehner still goes down this road, we're going to have to vacate the chair.
[01:43:34.479 --> 01:43:37.281]  I want to thank Mark Meadows for taking the lead.
[01:43:37.682 --> 01:43:38.522]  I joined him.
[01:43:38.803 --> 01:43:40.904]  Thomas Massey joined him from Kentucky.
[01:43:40.964 --> 01:43:42.125]  Ted Yoho joined him.
[01:43:42.686 --> 01:43:46.509]  And last week, Louie Goma added his name to the resolution.
[01:43:47.725 --> 01:43:54.088]  Well, I said this last time you were on, after you left, that because of your leadership, I think you are a target.
[01:43:54.729 --> 01:43:57.530]  Because of Louie Gohmert's leadership, he's undoubtedly a target.
[01:43:57.830 --> 01:44:04.454]  This administration is going after, I know from high-level sources, the Governor of Texas, as the Fed's investigating.
[01:44:04.534 --> 01:44:05.655]  The guy's as clean as a whistle.
[01:44:06.595 --> 01:44:09.657]  They've indicted the Attorney General who was fighting Obama.
[01:44:10.157 --> 01:44:11.378]  And it's happening in other states.
[01:44:11.438 --> 01:44:12.519]  They're taking the gloves off.
[01:44:12.539 --> 01:44:13.600]  This is a criminal group.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:18.985]  I know you're a gentleman and, you know, don't like to use terms like that, but the 28 pages, you've seen it.
[01:44:19.165 --> 01:44:21.127]  Senator Graham's seen it.
[01:44:21.187 --> 01:44:22.368]  The Saudis were involved.
[01:44:22.408 --> 01:44:24.550]  Quarterbacking 9-11, there was a stand down.
[01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:31.315]  Now we have General Flynn, the outgoing head of Defense Intelligence Agency, on television
[01:44:32.324 --> 01:44:37.768]  Five weeks ago saying they were ordered to aid Al Qaeda and ISIS and that it was very evil.
[01:44:38.148 --> 01:44:42.851]  We have the deputy head of the CIA saying on CBS News Face the Nation two weeks ago.
[01:44:43.712 --> 01:44:55.300]  That signifies to me that the government, the good people in government, whether it be the FBI or the CIA or Defense Intelligence or you name it, are ready to stand up and tell the truth.
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:58.022]  In fact, they're doing stuff that I think endangers their lives.
[01:44:58.582 --> 01:44:59.022]  I know that
[01:45:00.123 --> 01:45:05.566]  Colonel Schaefer's been seriously threatened for coming on the show about Benghazi and breaking the Stinger missiles here first.
[01:45:06.866 --> 01:45:12.669]  So the point is, there's not just bad guys out there, there are a lot of good guys as well, and the battle is heating up right now.
[01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:15.130]  How does this tie into the 28 pages?
[01:45:15.170 --> 01:45:20.773]  I mean, what do you make of high-level generals resigning and saying, I'm not going to work with Al-Qaeda and ISIS?
[01:45:21.153 --> 01:45:23.014]  I mean, this is sensational news.
[01:45:23.535 --> 01:45:26.336]  It makes it in a few papers, but then doesn't go anywhere.
[01:45:27.742 --> 01:45:45.325]  Alex, that's why my hope is, just like the 28 pages that you very kindly have had me on your show, and you know there have been other members, Steve Lynch, Democrat, Thomas Massie, Republican, have joined me in a resolution calling on the White House to declassify that information.
[01:45:46.666 --> 01:45:53.127]  I don't want to read too much into Mr. Boehner stepping down, but I'm telling you because of my frustration for a number of years,
[01:45:53.877 --> 01:46:06.724]  The right person in the Speaker's chair can become a spokesman, a spokesman for what is good and what is right and what is wrong and what needs to be changed from wrong to right.
[01:46:07.465 --> 01:46:18.812]  Like Obamacare, like third trimester abortion, partial birth, all of this is incredibly unpopular, it's unconstitutional, it could be overturned, but Boehner would never stand up.
[01:46:19.512 --> 01:46:20.853]  No, no.
[01:46:20.913 --> 01:46:23.014]  That's the whole point, like I said.
[01:46:24.122 --> 01:46:27.506]  John is a good person, but he is not a leader.
[01:46:27.586 --> 01:46:33.012]  He is a leader that would rather, instead of standing for principle, he'd rather give in on principle.
[01:46:33.733 --> 01:46:35.215]  I know you're a gentleman and a nice guy.
[01:46:35.235 --> 01:46:42.544]  He comes off as a great guy to play golf with, but how does he treat you in person when he runs into you, knowing for years you've been trying to get rid of him?
[01:46:43.246 --> 01:46:45.347]  He'll just say hello and that's fine.
[01:46:45.687 --> 01:46:47.628]  I don't need to have a conversation with him.
[01:46:47.848 --> 01:46:50.690]  It's simply because I know what's happening to this country.
[01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:57.193]  I'm willing to be on your show and other shows that speak about the fact that our debt is $18.3 trillion.
[01:46:57.673 --> 01:47:04.036]  When Bill Clinton was in office and left office, Alex, in 2000, we were $5.6 trillion in debt.
[01:47:04.076 --> 01:47:05.897]  We've tripled the debt in 15 years.
[01:47:06.517 --> 01:47:09.699]  We cannot continue to go this way and be a strong nation.
[01:47:09.739 --> 01:47:12.020]  We are a nation on weak legs right now.
[01:47:12.674 --> 01:47:17.856]  When it goes under, most economists say we'll be like Mexico or some of the third world country.
[01:47:17.956 --> 01:47:24.659]  I mean, people don't seem to get it's untenable and the ruling establishment is multinational.
[01:47:24.699 --> 01:47:26.039]  They don't care if America goes under.
[01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:29.000]  But what is going to happen if we fall into a third world country?
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:31.361]  I mean, the whole world is going to be affected by that.
[01:47:32.201 --> 01:47:34.762]  Well, Alex, I do the shopping in my family.
[01:47:34.802 --> 01:47:38.984]  I've been married 49 years to the same lady and I do the shopping and I can tell you,
[01:47:39.745 --> 01:47:46.612]  Everything that I buy, the boxes are smaller, the ingredients are smaller in the box, and the price goes up.
[01:47:46.772 --> 01:47:59.145]  I mean, we are at a time that America's at a crossroads, and either we're going to survive or we're not going to survive, and I think this is one step to surviving by getting the right person in the Speaker's chair.
[01:48:00.695 --> 01:48:01.255]  Absolutely.
[01:48:01.295 --> 01:48:02.896]  Well, you're always thanking me, sir.
[01:48:02.956 --> 01:48:03.817]  Please don't thank me.
[01:48:03.857 --> 01:48:05.938]  This is all about saving our Republic.
[01:48:05.978 --> 01:48:10.200]  I know you don't want thanks as well, but it's so refreshing to have a statesman like yourself.
[01:48:10.861 --> 01:48:18.385]  And in the last few minutes we have left here, I wanted to just ask you, because I know you have to fight against a lot of the money they send against you, both parties and the rest of it.
[01:48:18.845 --> 01:48:30.172]  What is your prognosis for more patriot, constitutionalist, common sense, Tea Party-type Republicans taking over the Republican Party and saving this country?
[01:48:31.328 --> 01:48:53.897]  Well, on the House side, I'm very hopeful that this resigning by Mr. Boehner will inspire other conservative libertarian types to run for office and not become part of the problem in Washington, but like a few of us are trying to be, is the solution to the problem in Washington.
[01:48:54.598 --> 01:48:57.519]  That's why, again, Alex, you and the many others
[01:49:08.545 --> 01:49:09.225]  Absolutely.
[01:49:09.805 --> 01:49:15.167]  I know you don't like to speak ill of people, but who would not be a good choice?
[01:49:15.207 --> 01:49:20.588]  What about Speaker Boehner's right-hand man?
[01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:22.969]  They're talking about trying to
[01:49:24.161 --> 01:49:26.783]  Get McCarthy in there, what's your view on that?
[01:49:26.963 --> 01:49:30.405]  I don't think anyone from the leadership team is the right person.
[01:49:31.946 --> 01:49:37.210]  And McCarthy's part of that, Scalise is part of that, and Kathy Rogers-McMorris.
[01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:47.397]  And they're good people, I like them as people, but I know that they don't have the backbone that we need in that Speaker's chair to change the direction of the House and to change the direction of this country.
[01:49:50.302 --> 01:49:51.123]  Very well said.
[01:49:51.603 --> 01:49:53.144]  Thank you so much, Congressman Jones.
[01:49:53.164 --> 01:49:54.325]  The minute and a half we have left.
[01:49:54.765 --> 01:49:57.367]  What else is on your radar that you want to tell folks about?
[01:49:58.188 --> 01:50:05.894]  Well, I would just like to tell people that, and I know I've been repetitive, but I'd like to say that we're not going to get many opportunities like we have now.
[01:50:06.494 --> 01:50:09.817]  We have a few days for the people to rally behind
[01:50:10.327 --> 01:50:13.648]  Congress to put the right person in that speaker's chair.
[01:50:14.068 --> 01:50:24.732]  Let's get us a conservative who believes in the Constitution, who believes in the Bible, who believes in the greatness of America, and stop all this wasteful spending overseas.
[01:50:24.792 --> 01:50:31.695]  I just read the title of the Washington Post article, Billions Wasted in Afghanistan, and we're going to be there eight more years, Alex.
[01:50:32.435 --> 01:50:33.196]  Wasting money.
[01:50:34.216 --> 01:50:36.737]  Let's spend some here in America and rebuild this great nation.
[01:50:37.501 --> 01:50:45.793]  Absolutely, and let's cut spending and cut taxes at the same time and turn on the prosperity machine and get our country out of debt.
[01:50:46.133 --> 01:50:49.878]  Congressman Jones, jones.house.gov, thank you so much.
[01:50:49.918 --> 01:50:50.960]  We really appreciate you.

[01:54:15.645 --> 01:54:18.508]  Ira Haines Ira Haines
[01:54:30.985 --> 01:54:36.269]  You know, I told the Mark Cuban story.
[01:54:46.187 --> 01:55:06.173]  Back in 2007, or was it 2008, you can look it up in the New York Times, I went on record and I said the Securities and Exchange Commission called up on the phone, threatened to put him in prison for insider trading, for stuff that was completely legal, if he put out loose change final cut that I produced on a thousand plus screens.
[01:55:07.853 --> 01:55:09.754]  And I told that story on air
[01:55:11.854 --> 01:55:18.377]  But you said it was a Hollywood producer of the film, wouldn't say who, because they asked us not to say, and then it came out in the New York Times a year later.
[01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:28.283]  And in the video on Infowars.com, source White House has FBI task force investigating Infowars, we have the video where I show the New York Times article.
[01:55:28.903 --> 01:55:31.164]  So you've seen him go after Dinesh D'Souza, everybody.
[01:55:31.805 --> 01:55:37.948]  They didn't just call him up, they sent him an email that he used to kill their court case, so they indicted him again!
[01:55:38.448 --> 01:55:39.489]  And he beat them again!
[01:55:41.398 --> 01:55:43.900]  96% of the time, you don't beat them because they'll frame you.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:50.165]  But they went so far as to say, we're gonna get you, that that's how he stopped them.
[01:55:50.685 --> 01:55:54.168]  The guy was worth like, you know, 4 billion, now he's worth like 5, 6 billion now.
[01:55:54.949 --> 01:55:56.390]  You know, smart businessman from nothing.
[01:55:57.350 --> 01:56:00.633]  He was able to beat them because they were so arrogant.
[01:56:01.974 --> 01:56:03.495]  I mean, that's how corrupt this country is.
[01:56:03.535 --> 01:56:07.178]  You really think 96% of people, the feds in doubt are really guilty?
[01:56:07.238 --> 01:56:08.139]  I mean, you really believe that?
[01:56:10.003 --> 01:56:11.805]  No, about half of them are completely innocent.
[01:56:12.706 --> 01:56:13.626]  It was major studies.
[01:56:13.686 --> 01:56:15.488]  A third of people on death row didn't do it.
[01:56:15.768 --> 01:56:17.270]  DNA testing now shows.
[01:56:17.290 --> 01:56:26.919]  I remember up in Round Rock, the prosecutor in Williamson County knew he was sending Michael Mortensen to prison and knew he was innocent.
[01:56:28.493 --> 01:56:29.953]  The guy had no criminal record.
[01:56:30.353 --> 01:56:31.654]  His wife had been killed.
[01:56:32.134 --> 01:56:34.814]  Why would you... I don't know why they do it.
[01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:38.075]  They just get off on putting good people in prison.
[01:56:38.655 --> 01:56:43.716]  I couldn't think of a more demonic thing to do, other than like sacrifice children or something.
[01:56:45.697 --> 01:56:47.297]  And I know the government's compartmentalized.
[01:56:47.317 --> 01:56:50.538]  There's a lot of people in government that aren't corrupt, but they're like in different divisions.
[01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:55.012]  So I only raised that to show we are big time.
[01:56:55.372 --> 01:56:56.533]  They know we're big time.
[01:56:56.893 --> 01:56:58.954]  They've tried to assassinate my name, everything.
[01:57:00.055 --> 01:57:00.695]  They failed.
[01:57:01.416 --> 01:57:10.081]  So they're moving the ballgame, and to the FBI's credit, they were ordered by the White House, according to multiple sources, two years ago, to dig up something, and they couldn't.
[01:57:12.002 --> 01:57:20.747]  So then it went to the FTC, and back to the FBI, and I'm two years into this, and I'm just, will they follow orders?
[01:57:21.468 --> 01:57:21.768]  I don't know.
[01:57:23.507 --> 01:57:25.249]  They've got a group out of D.C.
[01:57:25.309 --> 01:57:26.810]  reportedly will follow whatever order they're given.
[01:57:28.451 --> 01:57:29.092]  So, whatever.
[01:57:30.293 --> 01:57:31.014]  I'm not afraid.
[01:57:32.175 --> 01:57:34.457]  It'd be like saying, are you afraid some kidnappers are going to come?
[01:57:34.497 --> 01:57:35.598]  I mean, they're kidnappers.
[01:57:35.618 --> 01:57:36.338]  They're bad people.
[01:57:36.398 --> 01:57:38.220]  I mean, I'm not going to live in fear of it.
[01:57:41.423 --> 01:57:49.590]  I know this, and this is on record, I'm scared of a SWAT team raid or something like that, even though that's what they're talking about doing, just for the added media effect.
[01:57:52.654 --> 01:57:54.074]  We're not going to resist any of it.
[01:57:55.015 --> 01:58:00.836]  We're going to sit there and just be the martyrs we are, politically, and the whole thing will come out.
[01:58:01.677 --> 01:58:07.138]  And that's their only hope, I'm sure, from experts I've talked to and I concur, is to get us to do something stupid.
[01:58:07.559 --> 01:58:08.359]  And we're not going to do that.
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:16.921]  And the plan is, I can beat the rap, whatever it's going to be, I can't beat the ride to slow us down to whatever.
[01:58:17.181 --> 01:58:18.622]  We're not a small organization.
[01:58:20.116 --> 01:58:20.977]  We're very strong.
[01:58:21.017 --> 01:58:21.938]  We reach a lot of people.
[01:58:21.978 --> 01:58:22.939]  We have great supporters.
[01:58:23.399 --> 01:58:27.763]  And out of this, we're going to get bigger and raise more capital and be stronger.
[01:58:28.884 --> 01:58:31.466]  And we even have studios and things set up in other countries.
[01:58:31.967 --> 01:58:32.948]  Everything ready for this.
[01:58:33.048 --> 01:58:34.009]  I mean, you think we're stupid?
[01:58:36.010 --> 01:58:37.692]  This is the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:40.450]  And we've always expected this.
[01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:42.771]  So, be sure and support us, folks.

[01:58:54.058 --> 01:58:55.178]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:58:55.218 --> 01:58:55.979]  Incredible specials.
[01:59:00.546 --> 01:59:01.987]  I want more candy!
[01:59:02.147 --> 01:59:03.108]  I want more video games!
[01:59:03.228 --> 01:59:03.308]  Mine!
[01:59:03.428 --> 01:59:03.868]  Mine!
[01:59:03.888 --> 01:59:03.988]  Mine!
[01:59:30.546 --> 01:59:31.326]  I think so.
[02:00:02.538 --> 02:00:05.145]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.693 --> 02:00:17.313]  Big Brother.
[02:00:17.994 --> 02:00:19.014]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:19.754 --> 02:00:20.855]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:21.515 --> 02:00:22.316]  You want answers?
[02:00:23.096 --> 02:00:23.997]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.637 --> 02:00:28.239]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:28.839 --> 02:00:32.941]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.683 --> 02:00:39.404]  Satan knows he's running out of time.
[02:00:39.524 --> 02:00:40.604]  Boehner is falling.
[02:00:41.445 --> 02:00:45.447]  An attempt to save the neocon nest up there, the rhino nest.
[02:00:46.187 --> 02:00:48.249]  He is ejecting out of the cockpit.
[02:00:50.931 --> 02:00:55.014]  The globalists hate us for exposing the fact that the Boston bombing was a false flag.
[02:00:55.054 --> 02:00:57.616]  We don't know exactly what the brothers were up to.
[02:00:57.636 --> 02:00:58.877]  Were they double, triple agents?
[02:00:58.897 --> 02:01:01.099]  We just know they were on CIA payroll.
[02:01:02.551 --> 02:01:04.552]  We helped take over news conferences and expose that.
[02:01:04.592 --> 02:01:05.693]  We've done so many other things.
[02:01:06.013 --> 02:01:06.714]  I'm not bragging.
[02:01:06.754 --> 02:01:08.895]  I'm just pointing out that InfoWars is highly effective.
[02:01:09.395 --> 02:01:10.716]  Tip of the spear getting rid of Boehner.
[02:01:10.756 --> 02:01:13.518]  You just heard the guy at the very tip of the spear saying that earlier.
[02:01:13.998 --> 02:01:15.379]  You are the tip of the spear.
[02:01:15.479 --> 02:01:16.300]  You are the power.
[02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.081]  You're the ones that are having the effect.
[02:01:19.662 --> 02:01:21.103]  You're the ones that need to be saluted.
[02:01:22.764 --> 02:01:24.445]  And that's why I just throw it out there.
[02:01:24.485 --> 02:01:25.746]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:01:25.786 --> 02:01:27.387]  Sign off on your Facebook, your Twitter.

[02:01:38.528 --> 02:01:39.608]  Share it with friends and family.
[02:01:43.511 --> 02:01:50.395]  One thing that the source told me was the type of operation they're talking about is basically grabbing all our computers
[02:01:51.383 --> 02:01:55.284]  And even bank accounts and things to try to shut down the media operation.
[02:01:55.644 --> 02:01:56.904]  How obvious is that going to be?
[02:01:56.924 --> 02:01:57.525]  But they don't care.
[02:01:58.185 --> 02:01:58.725]  Doesn't matter.
[02:01:58.825 --> 02:02:03.666]  We'll just go get a satellite truck, fire it up with the uplinks and contracts and be on the air in an hour.
[02:02:05.447 --> 02:02:07.527]  They just, they're blind in ways.
[02:02:07.567 --> 02:02:10.368]  They haven't done stuff this naked before in America.
[02:02:11.288 --> 02:02:13.149]  And they just don't get what they're doing.
[02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:15.009]  I quite frankly am excited about this.
[02:02:16.389 --> 02:02:17.450]  And I prayed about it this morning.
[02:02:17.490 --> 02:02:18.730]  I said, God, am I getting sick?
[02:02:20.717 --> 02:02:22.358]  I mean, I'm getting off on this.
[02:02:22.438 --> 02:02:23.138]  I'm excited.
[02:02:23.498 --> 02:02:24.579]  I almost can't wait.
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:28.440]  And the answer is no.
[02:02:28.501 --> 02:02:29.161]  You wanted to fight?
[02:02:29.621 --> 02:02:30.501]  You asked to be a vessel?
[02:02:30.581 --> 02:02:31.862]  You wanted to be put up against these people?
[02:02:33.503 --> 02:02:35.063]  You wanted to have a big effect?
[02:02:35.083 --> 02:02:37.845]  You wanted to measure up to your forebears?
[02:02:38.045 --> 02:02:39.345]  You're gonna get your chance.
[02:02:42.827 --> 02:02:44.348]  Ha ha ha ha!
[02:02:44.448 --> 02:02:44.788]  Yeah!
[02:02:46.471 --> 02:02:53.141]  A life of substance, a life of meaning, a life of value, a life of fullness and doing the right thing.
[02:02:53.161 --> 02:02:59.210]  I just am so honored to be your host.
[02:02:59.270 --> 02:03:00.051]  I'm so honored to be here.
[02:03:00.071 --> 02:03:01.514]  I'm so honored to be in this position.
[02:03:03.737 --> 02:03:06.999]  I'm so honored that with your help we've made history so many times together.
[02:03:07.879 --> 02:03:24.209]  And I'm so honored to work with other great people like Matt Drudge and the folks at WorldNetDaily and people like Colonel Schaefer and Ron Paul and just all the others, the great patriots, the people that believe in humanity, that believe in a handshake, that believe in goodwill.
[02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:30.733]  I just feel humbled to be part of such a order.
[02:03:31.783 --> 02:03:37.007]  There's no official order, no group, no sign above the door, no membership card, but it is the Great Order.
[02:03:37.847 --> 02:03:39.048]  The Great Order of Men.
[02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:53.779]  Makes me think of that poem, Child Rollin' the Dark Tower Came, that I've played here so many times because, I guess I played it once or twice, because this is the Great Animating Contest of Liberty.
[02:03:56.061 --> 02:03:56.561]  This is it.
[02:03:58.451 --> 02:04:02.895]  And it is through adversity that we become men and women.
[02:04:05.697 --> 02:04:07.198]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[02:04:10.161 --> 02:04:11.802]  Such an incredible time to be alive.
[02:04:12.783 --> 02:04:24.393]  And to fight for my country, to fight for the world, to fight for the unborn, to fight for due process, to fight for low taxes, to fight for prosperity, to fight for truth, to fight for medical freedom.
[02:04:26.325 --> 02:04:39.214]  To be involved with this great crew of men and women here at InfoWars, to be standing together, taking action together, is amazing.
[02:04:43.777 --> 02:04:44.358]  It really is.
[02:04:45.862 --> 02:04:47.623]  I mean, I live a James Bond movie.
[02:04:48.383 --> 02:04:52.045]  Jakari ran into the actor that plays James Bond, the latest guy.
[02:04:52.986 --> 02:04:57.749]  He's got a little clip of him going to the U.N., I guess, to be all fanfare for the carbon tax.
[02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:59.530]  Probably, I don't know, his politics.
[02:05:00.070 --> 02:05:01.130]  That's probably why he was going.
[02:05:01.150 --> 02:05:02.611]  It's like, who cares?
[02:05:03.532 --> 02:05:05.593]  You know, I like the real James Bonds, I know.
[02:05:06.674 --> 02:05:07.834]  And believe me, I know a lot of them.
[02:05:07.874 --> 02:05:08.935]  A lot of them aren't public.
[02:05:10.723 --> 02:05:13.424]  Over the weekend, Cheryl Atkinson released the following article.
[02:05:13.584 --> 02:05:16.566]  What the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies.
[02:05:16.846 --> 02:05:21.988]  She starts off with the New England Journal of Medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[02:05:22.208 --> 02:05:27.411]  She then discloses the consulting firm behind the study, the Lewin Group, lists major vaccine makers among its clients.
[02:05:27.611 --> 02:05:31.973]  In fact, the Lewin Group's parent company, United Health Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare.
[02:05:32.133 --> 02:05:37.134]  And a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, QSSI, was given the contract to build the Obamacare website.
[02:05:37.274 --> 02:05:50.777]  She then looks at the AstroTurf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use, like weak, too small, haphazard, not replicated, junk science, flawed, unrelated, and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia.
[02:05:50.937 --> 02:05:56.079]  She then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage.
[02:05:56.339 --> 02:06:01.780]  In fact, permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines, and there's no dispute in that arena.
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:07.101]  So the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your face, shove this back in theirs.
[02:06:07.281 --> 02:06:10.042]  Rob Dew for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:10.442 --> 02:06:15.463]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:06:15.603 --> 02:06:21.484]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:06:21.704 --> 02:06:26.305]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:06:26.505 --> 02:06:29.826]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:06:30.066 --> 02:06:31.626]  No needles, no injections.
[02:06:32.026 --> 02:06:38.391]  Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:38.411 --> 02:06:41.233]  Brain Force is here.
[02:06:41.413 --> 02:06:43.535]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:06:43.635 --> 02:06:48.359]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[02:06:48.619 --> 02:06:51.782]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:51.902 --> 02:06:55.124]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:55.384 --> 02:06:57.086]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:06:57.346 --> 02:06:57.586]  I think.
[02:07:15.725 --> 02:07:16.125]  I don't know.
[02:07:44.241 --> 02:07:49.723]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[02:07:49.863 --> 02:07:53.064]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[02:07:53.164 --> 02:07:57.166]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[02:07:57.346 --> 02:07:59.486]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[02:07:59.666 --> 02:08:06.629]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:08:11.101 --> 02:08:11.881]  Paul, guess what?
[02:08:12.001 --> 02:08:12.161]  What?
[02:08:12.381 --> 02:08:14.682]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell and we heard him talking to his lawyer.
[02:08:14.922 --> 02:08:17.323]  You see, we took the mic and we hid it up in the cell window.
[02:08:17.343 --> 02:08:18.543]  Wait a minute.
[02:08:18.643 --> 02:08:19.424]  What are you talking about?
[02:08:19.564 --> 02:08:20.964]  We bugged Mr. Blake's cell.
[02:08:21.904 --> 02:08:22.525]  You what?
[02:08:22.865 --> 02:08:24.785]  We bugged the cell with Arnold's tape recorder.
[02:08:24.945 --> 02:08:25.946]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[02:08:25.986 --> 02:08:26.866]  I can't listen to that.
[02:08:27.026 --> 02:08:28.927]  But Paul... Opie, I can't listen to that.
[02:08:29.027 --> 02:08:29.907]  I'm not permitted.
[02:08:30.387 --> 02:08:31.707]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[02:08:32.088 --> 02:08:33.788]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[02:08:34.748 --> 02:08:36.689]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[02:08:36.949 --> 02:08:38.110]  But Paul, this is different.
[02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:39.330]  Yes, it's worse.
[02:08:40.097 --> 02:08:43.019]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[02:08:43.399 --> 02:08:45.181]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[02:08:45.201 --> 02:08:48.703]  But, Pa, if you just listen to this... Opie, I can't listen.
[02:08:49.063 --> 02:08:50.284]  Pa, you're erasing the tape!
[02:08:50.344 --> 02:08:52.105]  That's what I mean to do.
[02:08:53.546 --> 02:08:56.828]  You bugged a conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[02:08:57.789 --> 02:09:01.511]  Now, that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[02:09:02.052 --> 02:09:03.613]  But, Pa... No buts.
[02:09:04.233 --> 02:09:06.455]  But if it helps the law... Opie...
[02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:10.211]  The law can't use this kind of help.
[02:09:12.071 --> 02:09:12.831]  Paul, guess what?
[02:09:12.971 --> 02:09:13.131]  What?
[02:09:13.351 --> 02:09:14.531]  We bugged Mr. Blake Stallion.
[02:09:14.571 --> 02:09:16.452]  We heard him talking to his lawyer.
[02:09:16.672 --> 02:09:20.892]  And so it repeats in our own day today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:22.473 --> 02:09:24.973]  Over and over again, and now they'd say, good kid.
[02:09:25.413 --> 02:09:27.494]  Good job you spied on them without a warrant.
[02:09:27.814 --> 02:09:30.274]  Good job you dialed in to what was happening.
[02:09:31.034 --> 02:09:35.095]  This is the total overthrow of the Americana system and what made us so special.
[02:09:36.104 --> 02:09:43.751]  And now they sit here with the DEA, the FBI, and all the rest of them, creating fake investigations where they frame people.
[02:09:45.112 --> 02:09:53.459]  And then they go and parallel construct where they claim they got all the evidence and go officially lie in front of the federal judges.
[02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:56.822]  And the federal judges know full well they're doing it.
[02:09:57.912 --> 02:09:59.652]  Look up parallel construction for yourself.
[02:10:00.152 --> 02:10:06.834]  And they even have classes at the Justice Department for the FBI and others to learn how to lie.
[02:10:07.674 --> 02:10:10.434]  But you gotta become a supervisor to get into those classes.
[02:10:10.754 --> 02:10:11.954]  Then you get the bigger paycheck.
[02:10:13.055 --> 02:10:16.335]  And so this is the criminal government that we have.
[02:10:17.155 --> 02:10:25.917]  And of course the DEA is out in Afghanistan torturing people to death that don't agree to only sell their opium to the United States.
[02:10:29.110 --> 02:10:31.271]  This is how the globalists operate.
[02:10:31.291 --> 02:10:37.495]  In fact, they pulled up the Reuters article, but the mainstream media will always say, oh, that's Infowars, so we save a few paragraphs to document it.
[02:10:37.735 --> 02:10:41.258]  Click on the Reuters link itself and we'll take you to U.S.
[02:10:41.278 --> 02:10:49.123]  Drug Enforcement Agency halts huge secret data program with the NSA where they parallel construct fake investigations.
[02:10:50.243 --> 02:10:55.867]  How could anyone ever sit in on one of these federal juries and believe anything you're being told?
[02:10:59.161 --> 02:11:01.162]  Because this is not the federal government.
[02:11:01.402 --> 02:11:06.323]  This is an alien, foreign, banking cartel that began to take over the country.
[02:11:06.523 --> 02:11:12.165]  The face sucker got on us in 1913, laid eggs in us, D.C.
[02:11:12.345 --> 02:11:19.128]  blew open, a bunch of aliens came out, and now they've got the whole country and the whole world infested.
[02:11:21.868 --> 02:11:26.270]  America was a big, strong host, and millions of eggs popped out of us.
[02:11:30.933 --> 02:11:31.774]  That's the allegory.
[02:11:33.796 --> 02:11:36.819]  And now we got our guts hanging out, stumbling around half-dead.
[02:11:36.839 --> 02:11:41.324]  And the Tea Party's like, you might want to sew your intestines shut, you might live.
[02:11:41.825 --> 02:11:43.166]  And the media's going, shut up!
[02:11:43.226 --> 02:11:45.349]  All that red stuff spraying out of your belly is loving.
[02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:47.030]  Just lay down and relax.
[02:11:49.343 --> 02:11:50.324]  They just want us to die.
[02:11:50.364 --> 02:11:51.165]  They're done with us.
[02:11:51.185 --> 02:11:52.447]  They already sucked us dry.
[02:11:52.707 --> 02:11:54.209]  We already hatched world government.
[02:11:54.429 --> 02:11:56.151]  We already funded total takeover.
[02:11:56.351 --> 02:12:00.015]  We have the highest rates of cancer, diabetes, neurological disorders.
[02:12:00.336 --> 02:12:04.941]  They're chemtrailing us, poisoning the water, dumbing us down, just slaughtering everyone.
[02:12:06.543 --> 02:12:08.946]  You got all these compartmentalized idiots working for the government.
[02:12:10.014 --> 02:12:11.475]  They think they're part of the winning team.
[02:12:11.496 --> 02:12:12.617]  Their kids drink fluoride.
[02:12:12.637 --> 02:12:14.458]  They breathe the chemtrails.
[02:12:14.498 --> 02:12:15.900]  They take all the shots.
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:19.403]  Probably a third of the feds listening to the show got a kid can't even talk.
[02:12:21.225 --> 02:12:22.827]  That's your bosses is what they did to you.
[02:12:23.107 --> 02:12:24.268]  You're not part of the winning team.
[02:12:24.308 --> 02:12:25.609]  You're getting screwed over like everybody else.
[02:12:27.792 --> 02:12:29.914]  And see they know my straight Texas talk.
[02:12:30.294 --> 02:12:33.998]  My hardcore in your face paradigm shattering info.
[02:12:36.587 --> 02:12:42.392]  Cuts through the trance for whatever grating reason, and gets people thinking because I cover stuff so horrible.
[02:12:44.815 --> 02:12:48.638]  See, the globalists do things so bad that people can't even imagine it's going on.
[02:12:49.279 --> 02:12:50.520]  The believability's not there.
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:58.067]  But then I show you historical examples, and show you what's currently happening, and so people get the believability, they research for themselves,
[02:13:00.569 --> 02:13:04.410]  I've had listeners for 21 years and people heard me talk about Planned Parenthood and baby parts.
[02:13:05.210 --> 02:13:07.091]  And hospitals killing people for their organs.
[02:13:07.111 --> 02:13:07.831]  That's now in the news.
[02:13:07.851 --> 02:13:09.252]  What do you think happened to our credibility?
[02:13:09.912 --> 02:13:11.512]  We have a congressman on to get rid of Boehner.
[02:13:12.673 --> 02:13:13.153]  Now he's going.
[02:13:13.173 --> 02:13:14.333]  What do you think happened to our credibility?
[02:13:14.633 --> 02:13:15.954]  We exposed Benghazi first.
[02:13:15.994 --> 02:13:16.834]  What happened to our credibility?
[02:13:17.234 --> 02:13:18.055]  Fast and furious.
[02:13:18.315 --> 02:13:20.615]  Homeland Security, DHS, MIAC memos.
[02:13:20.815 --> 02:13:22.396]  First, first, first, first, first, first.
[02:13:23.581 --> 02:13:26.124]  The illegals being shipped in by Border Patrol given vouchers.
[02:13:26.184 --> 02:13:27.024]  Jakari Jackson.
[02:13:27.725 --> 02:13:28.586]  Adam Salazar.
[02:13:28.766 --> 02:13:29.527]  First, first, first.
[02:13:29.687 --> 02:13:30.268]  We're first.
[02:13:30.388 --> 02:13:30.908]  We're first.
[02:13:31.068 --> 02:13:31.569]  We're first.
[02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:32.209]  We're first.
[02:13:32.350 --> 02:13:32.830]  We're first.
[02:13:32.970 --> 02:13:33.451]  We're first.
[02:13:33.591 --> 02:13:34.071]  We're first.
[02:13:34.211 --> 02:13:34.712]  We're first.
[02:13:35.493 --> 02:13:35.733]  We're first.
[02:13:35.753 --> 02:13:41.599]  Or we take what's currently going on and decipher it and then what our analysis ends up to be right 99% of the time.
[02:13:45.379 --> 02:13:46.039]  It's constant.
[02:13:46.139 --> 02:13:47.820]  It's not hard once you shift your paradigm.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:51.282]  They say it's 10,000 illegals they're going to bring in out of the Middle East.
[02:13:51.342 --> 02:13:53.363]  I say it's going to be a couple hundred thousand by next week.
[02:13:53.543 --> 02:13:54.043]  It was.
[02:13:55.004 --> 02:13:56.124]  I've got their formula.
[02:13:56.424 --> 02:13:57.365]  I've got them down.
[02:13:57.885 --> 02:13:59.125]  I've got the jack on them.
[02:14:00.626 --> 02:14:05.068]  I'm not bragging because the more I get right, this is the most important thing I've said in a year.
[02:14:05.108 --> 02:14:05.828]  Listen to me carefully.
[02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:10.831]  I subconsciously have sold out at some level.
[02:14:11.735 --> 02:14:22.082]  Because I catch myself not being as hardcore, I catch myself not saying stuff because it's so horrible, even though I know it's true, because I don't want to be rude, I don't want to be hateful, I don't want to be incendiary.
[02:14:22.422 --> 02:14:23.283]  I have children.
[02:14:23.803 --> 02:14:25.464]  In my flesh, I want to protect them.
[02:14:25.805 --> 02:14:28.487]  In my flesh, I don't want to confront these demons.
[02:14:30.108 --> 02:14:31.649]  But you know, my spirit's stronger than my flesh.
[02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:36.232]  Spirit's willing, the flesh is weak, well, that's a two-way street.
[02:14:37.935 --> 02:14:42.798]  My kids don't have a future anyways if we don't beat this, so I've just got to decide to do the right thing.
[02:14:43.098 --> 02:14:43.919]  May the heavens fall.
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:47.021]  And you've got to decide that.
[02:14:47.801 --> 02:14:49.162]  Because I know what we're facing.
[02:14:49.242 --> 02:14:50.343]  I know how serious it is.
[02:14:50.683 --> 02:14:51.944]  Who's up first, your car or your night?
[02:14:53.725 --> 02:14:54.586]  Go to night first, okay?
[02:14:58.089 --> 02:15:00.171]  It's just all this epic stuff's going on around us.
[02:15:00.211 --> 02:15:11.301]  I mean, it's epic that every major GMO stacked crop has huge birth defect problems, cancer problems, stillbirth problems in every major study.
[02:15:11.342 --> 02:15:11.702]  Look it up.
[02:15:11.802 --> 02:15:16.546]  I mean, we're eating stuff that kills the rats, guinea pigs, chinchillas that eat it.
[02:15:16.566 --> 02:15:20.110]  I mean, that's just epic.
[02:15:22.469 --> 02:15:27.735]  Glyphosate is in all lower 48 water supplies, and in Hawaii.
[02:15:28.455 --> 02:15:29.757]  It's miracle growth for cancer.
[02:15:30.938 --> 02:15:31.478]  That's epic.
[02:15:31.579 --> 02:15:32.019]  They know it.
[02:15:32.039 --> 02:15:32.780]  They did it on purpose.
[02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:34.562]  Same company did Agent Orange.
[02:15:35.643 --> 02:15:36.664]  Dioxin, all of it.
[02:15:36.684 --> 02:15:38.386]  I mean, these people are demons.
[02:15:41.058 --> 02:15:45.061]  I wouldn't be surprised if I got magic sunglasses and put them on and it's like they lives real or something.
[02:15:45.321 --> 02:15:48.244]  I mean, these people are so whacked out, so evil, so bad.
[02:15:48.444 --> 02:15:52.327]  Hospitals, it turns out, know they have mold that basically is going to kill a bunch of people come in there.
[02:15:52.627 --> 02:15:53.768]  They don't shut the hospital down.
[02:15:53.788 --> 02:15:54.488]  They don't clean it out.
[02:15:54.528 --> 02:15:57.251]  They want money so they cover up all the deaths.
[02:15:57.311 --> 02:16:02.495]  I mean, and then nothing's done to them because they're above the law.
[02:16:04.476 --> 02:16:05.437]  That came out two days ago.
[02:16:14.329 --> 02:16:18.510]  Oh, we gotta give the illegal aliens free babies and free health care and free everything.
[02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:27.772]  I saw an article where a bunch of California cities today, this week, started in a coalition paying for all the health care of illegals as a way to bring more people up there.
[02:16:28.052 --> 02:16:36.054]  And then I know all these people, Hispanic, black, white, who are losing their houses in the IRS, retirees are losing them, people that can't get health care that are citizens.
[02:16:36.674 --> 02:16:37.615]  I mean, it's sick.
[02:16:38.695 --> 02:16:39.375]  It's sick.
[02:16:40.711 --> 02:16:47.393]  The people that run this country have it out for America because America almost beat the British Empire and the world government.
[02:16:47.793 --> 02:16:49.933]  America almost beat the Rothschild Combine.
[02:16:50.274 --> 02:16:52.954]  Free market competes directly with their takeover.
[02:16:56.035 --> 02:16:57.996]  And they want our head on their wall.
[02:16:58.056 --> 02:16:59.956]  They want to mount us like a trophy.
[02:17:01.356 --> 02:17:02.537]  They want to kill our seed.
[02:17:05.838 --> 02:17:07.098]  They want to salt our earth.
[02:17:09.867 --> 02:17:12.208]  And folks better wake up to the war that's going on.
[02:17:12.969 --> 02:17:14.450]  That's why the system doesn't like us.
[02:17:14.930 --> 02:17:15.930]  Believe me, they're not stupid.
[02:17:16.210 --> 02:17:24.335]  They know if they try to assassinate me in the media, or physically, or come after us, that it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:17:24.375 --> 02:17:27.717]  But you see, letting us continue on blows up even bigger.
[02:17:28.277 --> 02:17:30.158]  And that's because I'm not selling out.
[02:17:30.538 --> 02:17:31.499]  I'm going all the way.
[02:17:31.879 --> 02:17:33.040]  I'm telling it like it is.
[02:17:34.275 --> 02:17:40.918]  I'm becoming conscious of the fact of my own weakness, and I'm refusing to be weak in the face of their weakness.
[02:17:41.398 --> 02:17:44.099]  I refuse to crawl around on my belly like they do.
[02:17:44.979 --> 02:17:45.960]  Let's go to David Knight.
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.201]  We'll come back in the next segment with him, then Jakari Jackson at the bottom of the hour.
[02:17:49.221 --> 02:17:51.542]  They've been filing a bunch of amazing reports in New York.
[02:17:52.022 --> 02:17:54.243]  The video reports are up on InfoWars.com.
[02:17:54.803 --> 02:17:56.144]  David Knight, thank you for joining us.
[02:17:57.418 --> 02:17:59.061]  David Knight for InfoWars.com.
[02:17:59.221 --> 02:18:02.847]  I'm here at Ground Zero, the 9-11 Museum.
[02:18:02.887 --> 02:18:04.049]  The Pope spoke here earlier.
[02:18:04.129 --> 02:18:07.395]  Actually, it was a world religion ceremony.
[02:18:07.435 --> 02:18:11.001]  But before we talk about that, Alex, I want to talk about what happened at the UN this morning.
[02:18:11.698 --> 02:18:16.380]  At the UN, as part of his speech, one of the things that he said was that the environment has rights.
[02:18:16.780 --> 02:18:17.340]  That's a quote.
[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:19.101]  The environment has rights.
[02:18:19.141 --> 02:18:20.081]  And he's going to speak for them.
[02:18:20.121 --> 02:18:20.881]  That's the classic take on it.
[02:18:20.901 --> 02:18:21.241]  That's right.
[02:18:21.641 --> 02:18:22.022]  That's right.
[02:18:22.422 --> 02:18:27.924]  And so what he's selling there is essentially Gaia religion, Gaia theory that we've seen.
[02:18:27.984 --> 02:18:31.265]  Many people push for the Earth Firsters, that agenda.
[02:18:31.565 --> 02:18:39.147]  Many people look at this, whether they're Catholic, or I've gotten a lot of tweetbacks from people saying, well, I agree with the Pope, and I'm not a Catholic, I'm an atheist.
[02:18:39.207 --> 02:18:40.448]  I think what he's doing is great.
[02:18:40.888 --> 02:18:45.330]  Those people need to understand that this is not a moral case that's being made.
[02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:47.150]  This is a political takeover.
[02:18:47.470 --> 02:18:49.571]  And there's evidence of that, Alex.
[02:18:49.991 --> 02:18:54.313]  The Chinese President met with Obama right after the Pope left in Washington yesterday.
[02:18:54.373 --> 02:18:57.454]  Today they're releasing an agenda that the U.S.
[02:18:57.654 --> 02:18:59.875]  and China have agreed on cap and trade.
[02:19:00.315 --> 02:19:01.756]  This is all falling into place.
[02:19:02.176 --> 02:19:04.637]  That's the next step, just like the TPP.
[02:19:04.697 --> 02:19:07.618]  And you can see the parallel structure with the TPP as well.
[02:19:08.138 --> 02:19:22.124]  The United States, in the center, enacting a Trans-Pacific Agreement, enacting a Trans-Atlantic Agreement, at the same time, we are the spine on which they attach these two wings, bringing these things together in the next step towards global governance.
[02:19:22.164 --> 02:19:27.727]  But they're also doing it with the climate change agenda, the cap and trade agenda.
[02:19:28.087 --> 02:19:31.028]  Because what they're going to do is they're going to cap and tax you.
[02:19:31.068 --> 02:19:32.769]  They're going to control your energy uses.
[02:19:33.409 --> 02:19:41.900]  And you can see in this particular instance, we've got the Chinese president, the US president, and essentially the cultural leader of Europe.
[02:19:41.941 --> 02:19:45.705]  There's not a strong central leader in Europe that could speak for all of Europe.
[02:19:45.986 --> 02:19:51.353]  So they bring in the Pope, and with the added advantage, Alex, that he can make a moral case.
[02:19:51.693 --> 02:19:52.073]  That's right.
[02:19:52.133 --> 02:19:53.634]  He's there to cement it all together.
[02:19:53.654 --> 02:19:57.056]  They're making their full push right now for open planetary government.
[02:19:57.437 --> 02:19:58.497]  Excellent job breaking it down.
[02:19:58.557 --> 02:19:59.418]  Come back more, David.
[02:19:59.798 --> 02:20:00.459]  Lay more of it out.
[02:20:00.499 --> 02:20:02.160]  Then we'll talk to Jakari Jackson after that.
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:03.721]  Stay with us on this live Friday.

[02:22:01.536 --> 02:22:04.237]  Being a vegetarian, it's hard getting all the protein I need.
[02:22:04.257 --> 02:22:04.497]  I try to

[02:24:36.585 --> 02:24:42.930]  I want to get back into this moment of world government, but separate from that, David, you've come down here to Texas, your wife,
[02:24:43.850 --> 02:24:45.451]  Your family, you're doing a great job.
[02:24:45.471 --> 02:24:47.673]  You know, I've told you about backup plans.
[02:24:47.753 --> 02:24:50.895]  If they try to come after me, I've kept you out of the whole business end of things.
[02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:53.557]  For you and Paul Watson to fill my shoes.
[02:24:53.877 --> 02:24:58.320]  If they kill me or if they set me up long before this, I knew stuff was going on.
[02:24:59.341 --> 02:25:07.187]  But I'm sure you may have read this morning and perhaps seen a video where Source, White House's FBI task force investigating info wars.
[02:25:07.667 --> 02:25:09.889]  I mean, they've got all these White House-run media outlets saying
[02:25:10.770 --> 02:25:12.241]  It's time to arrest me and stuff.
[02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:17.151]  I'm just a canary in the coal mine.
[02:25:17.171 --> 02:25:27.956]  They're going after people across the board, which shows we have power, which shows we're having an effect, which shows they need to not have any opposition to execute what they're about to do.
[02:25:28.336 --> 02:25:29.736]  It's a very reckless move.
[02:25:30.096 --> 02:25:38.900]  It's not like there hasn't been corruption in government before in this country, but it was smart enough to not go after vocal opposition in the middle of a sunny day.
[02:25:40.541 --> 02:25:42.262]  This is really getting to crazy town.
[02:25:42.302 --> 02:25:43.162]  Your take, David Knight?
[02:25:44.468 --> 02:25:45.648]  Well, Alex, that's very true.
[02:25:45.668 --> 02:25:52.751]  As I was listening to the press conference where John Boehner resigned, and again, that's something that we've been pushing really hard for.
[02:25:52.791 --> 02:25:54.012]  He tried to put a brave face on it.
[02:25:54.092 --> 02:25:59.634]  One of the reporters said, if you don't have anybody following you, you're not a leader, you're just somebody taking a walk.
[02:26:00.914 --> 02:26:02.015]  And that's the key.
[02:26:02.055 --> 02:26:03.075]  That's what we have to understand.
[02:26:03.095 --> 02:26:07.317]  When I look at all the people following the post... The government has a 9% approval rating.
[02:26:07.657 --> 02:26:09.618]  We have a high... Exactly, it's illegitimate.
[02:26:09.658 --> 02:26:10.198]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:26:11.223 --> 02:26:18.125]  Well, when I look at all these people following the Pope, to me, the big story is not the prepared speeches that the Pope is making.
[02:26:18.165 --> 02:26:21.746]  Yes, it's important that he's selling nonsense that the environment has rights.
[02:26:21.766 --> 02:26:27.687]  It would be laughable if we knew, if we didn't know that that was going to be taken literally and used against us.
[02:26:28.028 --> 02:26:33.329]  But the thing that gives him power are the people that follow him, not knowing what the agenda is about.
[02:26:33.869 --> 02:26:39.332]  And so that's our task, Alex, is to tell people what's behind this, to give them a broader perspective.
[02:26:39.593 --> 02:26:44.616]  If you want to understand what this is about in the immediate future, it's about climate change.
[02:26:44.656 --> 02:26:45.176]  That's the next...
[02:26:46.664 --> 02:26:47.365]  I don't know.
[02:27:06.866 --> 02:27:14.547]  It's not going to... Don't talk to me about global warming, about a global climate issue, if you're only going to put this selectively on the developed nations.
[02:27:14.607 --> 02:27:15.668]  So they learned their lesson.
[02:27:16.148 --> 02:27:17.108]  They bided their time.
[02:27:17.128 --> 02:27:19.248]  And they've got the big third world leader.
[02:27:19.268 --> 02:27:21.008]  The Pope is the leader of the third world.
[02:27:21.769 --> 02:27:22.929]  Mainly Catholic in the third world.
[02:27:23.189 --> 02:27:31.410]  They've now got him there to sucker them in to the eugenics, extermination, austerity movement, which will kill a billion people, Lord Monckton's numbers show it.
[02:27:31.890 --> 02:27:33.390]  That's why I get so angry at him.
[02:27:33.451 --> 02:27:36.051]  He knows full well this is an exterminist agenda.
[02:27:37.077 --> 02:27:37.538]  Exactly.
[02:27:37.618 --> 02:27:40.244]  Let me read you what Mother Jones said, because they're not Catholic.
[02:27:40.802 --> 02:27:46.883]  They're not looking at this with the starry eyes of someone who's projecting onto the Pope what they would like it to be.
[02:27:47.063 --> 02:27:49.303]  They said something big and strange is happening in the U.S.
[02:27:49.323 --> 02:27:49.684]  this week.
[02:27:49.964 --> 02:27:53.644]  Obama, the Pope, and the President of China are teaming up to save the world.
[02:27:54.004 --> 02:27:56.265]  No, they're teaming up to rule the world.
[02:27:56.565 --> 02:28:00.425]  That's precisely what this is about, and they're doing it for the people behind the scenes.
[02:28:00.745 --> 02:28:02.326]  That's the agenda that you need to understand.
[02:28:02.346 --> 02:28:04.266]  It's being sold as being compassionate.
[02:28:04.466 --> 02:28:09.787]  It's being sold... And we've got the Ford Foundation, a fake liberal publication, lauding
[02:28:10.547 --> 02:28:19.312]  A foreign communist leader, the Pope, and the President combining forces to save us when we know it's all about tyranny.
[02:28:20.213 --> 02:28:20.433]  Yes.
[02:28:20.793 --> 02:28:26.136]  And of course all of them are on the same page when it comes to a redistribution of wealth.
[02:28:26.756 --> 02:28:28.457]  All the money in the hands of a few people.
[02:28:28.898 --> 02:28:31.879]  The Chinese government was communist when it suited them.
[02:28:31.959 --> 02:28:33.540]  Now they're a group of fascists.
[02:28:33.841 --> 02:28:34.861]  And that's really what this is.
[02:28:34.901 --> 02:28:36.282]  There's not really any difference.
[02:28:36.622 --> 02:28:41.207]  When you get down to it at the end game, there's no difference between fascism and communism.
[02:28:41.447 --> 02:28:46.052]  It's a small elite cabal that is running everything and they can just use whatever label they want.
[02:28:46.272 --> 02:28:47.513]  People have to get beyond labels.
[02:28:47.754 --> 02:28:49.215]  They have to get beyond personality.
[02:28:49.435 --> 02:28:52.639]  That's what concerns me so much, Alex, about the GOP election.
[02:28:52.819 --> 02:28:53.560]  When I see everybody
[02:28:53.960 --> 02:28:59.344]  Falling in love with personality or on the Democrat side as we saw with Obama eight years ago.
[02:28:59.685 --> 02:29:02.247]  We need to look at the agenda of these people.
[02:29:02.447 --> 02:29:03.928]  We need to vet them carefully.
[02:29:04.168 --> 02:29:10.333]  And we need to stop putting all of our hopes on some distant high ruler that is going to save us in this life.
[02:29:10.393 --> 02:29:11.834]  And we need to work at the local level.
[02:29:12.095 --> 02:29:15.717]  Now today he was at the 9-11 Memorial Museum here.
[02:29:15.757 --> 02:29:17.539]  They had a multi-religion service.
[02:29:18.079 --> 02:29:18.940]  That's now over.
[02:29:19.721 --> 02:29:21.262]  But Alex, as we were watching that
[02:29:22.279 --> 02:29:27.988]  He was saying, and all these different religious leaders were saying, every life is valuable.
[02:29:28.529 --> 02:29:32.315]  And all religions take all these lives as indispensable.
[02:29:32.335 --> 02:29:34.058]  Well, the key is they get to speak.
[02:29:34.198 --> 02:29:36.942]  They get to speak for the environment and the quote.
[02:29:37.483 --> 02:29:42.966]  All religions working together in freedom, and then they let radical Islam run wild, but then arrest Christians for free speech.
[02:29:43.286 --> 02:29:43.826]  Stay there, David.
[02:29:43.846 --> 02:29:44.746]  I want you to finish up.
[02:29:44.766 --> 02:29:46.947]  Then we're gonna go to Jakari Jackson and get his take.
[02:29:46.987 --> 02:29:48.428]  He's been filing amazing reports.
[02:29:48.908 --> 02:29:56.151]  It's all coming up straight ahead on this Friday edition, and back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., if they haven't SWAT teamed me.
[02:29:57.432 --> 02:29:58.853]  And I tell you, this is exciting.
[02:29:59.553 --> 02:30:00.453]  We're on the march.
[02:30:00.954 --> 02:30:02.554]  The empire's on the run.
[02:30:03.475 --> 02:30:06.156]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:10.706 --> 02:30:13.407]  Over the weekend, Cheryl Atkinson released the following article.
[02:30:13.567 --> 02:30:16.549]  What the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies.
[02:30:16.829 --> 02:30:22.011]  She starts off with a New England Journal of Medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[02:30:22.191 --> 02:30:27.394]  She then discloses the consulting firm behind the study, the Lewin Group, lists major vaccine makers among its clients.
[02:30:27.594 --> 02:30:31.956]  In fact, the Lewin Group's parent company, United Health Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare.
[02:30:32.116 --> 02:30:37.097]  And a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, QSSI, was given the contract to build the Obamacare website.
[02:30:37.257 --> 02:30:50.760]  She then looks at the AstroTurf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use, like weak, too small, haphazard, not replicated, junk science, flawed, unrelated, and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia.
[02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:56.042]  She then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage.
[02:30:56.342 --> 02:31:01.763]  In fact, permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines, and there's no dispute in that arena.
[02:31:01.903 --> 02:31:07.085]  So the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your face, shove this back in theirs.

[02:33:37.122 --> 02:33:40.363]  We stand at historic crossroads.
[02:33:40.443 --> 02:33:41.784]  We've passed the point of no return.
[02:33:42.524 --> 02:33:45.605]  World government denied for so long, now out in the open.
[02:33:46.146 --> 02:33:48.066]  A pope calling for a one world religion.
[02:33:49.527 --> 02:33:58.511]  Major companies from Japan to Mexico, from the Netherlands to Chile are demanding their employees take chips to be able to enter the building.
[02:33:59.891 --> 02:34:01.132]  Cash is to be banned.
[02:34:01.992 --> 02:34:03.813]  World ID cards are being promoted.
[02:34:07.062 --> 02:34:11.303]  David Knight is our reporter on the ground outside the World Trade Center.
[02:34:11.323 --> 02:34:12.324]  They were outside the U.N.
[02:34:12.424 --> 02:34:13.044]  earlier today.
[02:34:13.064 --> 02:34:31.590]  Jakari Jackson is going to give us his take on a bunch of issues in a moment, but David Knight, you were getting into this epic moment where they pushed the entire eugenics, transhumanist, animal rights movement that isn't about animal rights, but about government taking human liberty away in the name of animals, the end of private property.
[02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:36.172]  I mean, this is all happening with this fabulously rich pope.
[02:34:37.293 --> 02:34:43.159]  And Obama and the Chinese President lecturing everyone on austerity as they get ready to screw the people.
[02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:46.122]  In the past, governments tried to create prosperity to be popular.
[02:34:46.563 --> 02:34:49.486]  Now they sell us on how ugly we are and how great it is to be poor.
[02:34:49.886 --> 02:34:52.089]  This is truly a 1984 society.
[02:34:52.669 --> 02:34:55.693]  A world of being trampled and being trampled upon and trampling.
[02:34:57.296 --> 02:34:58.196]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:34:58.236 --> 02:35:03.838]  They're telling you that they're going to stand for the environment, that the environment has rights, that animals have rights.
[02:35:04.178 --> 02:35:06.099]  This is the path to tyranny.
[02:35:06.499 --> 02:35:10.140]  They're going to be the ones who tell you how to protect the environment, how to protect the rights.
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:11.181]  It's just a beard.
[02:35:11.421 --> 02:35:16.342]  And of course, today what we saw was essentially a world religion ceremony.
[02:35:16.382 --> 02:35:23.004]  Look, I know a lot of people look at this and they say, isn't it great that all these different religions could come together and agree that 9-11 was a bad thing?
[02:35:23.024 --> 02:35:24.345]  And I say, yes, it is.
[02:35:25.109 --> 02:35:33.572]  But that's not the way you get religious tolerances by having a one world religion that says that we all worship the same God.
[02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:42.351]  That is, if you believe that you're a fool, if you tell people that you're a deceiver, the way to have tolerance of people is by something called the First Amendment.
[02:35:42.671 --> 02:35:45.252]  We solved that problem here in America once upon a time.
[02:35:45.432 --> 02:35:51.854]  We're about to undo that again, because if you have a one-world religion, there will be no tolerance for your religion.
[02:35:51.874 --> 02:35:56.575]  We already see Christians being targeted under this liberal one-world religion garbage.
[02:35:56.715 --> 02:35:58.876]  The only religion being targeted is true Christianity.
[02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:08.657]  And let me tell you, you know, the Pope is very concerned about the Muslims who died as part of the Hajj, you know, in Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:09.178 --> 02:36:11.800]  And there were over 700 people who died in a stampede.
[02:36:12.260 --> 02:36:16.183]  That's the seventh incident, according to my count, since 1990.
[02:36:16.924 --> 02:36:19.446]  Over 3,000 people have died doing that.
[02:36:19.486 --> 02:36:21.468]  So it's happening over and over and over again.
[02:36:21.728 --> 02:36:23.870]  Yet the Pope will not criticize Islam for that.
[02:36:24.290 --> 02:36:27.773]  Do you think if there were 3,000 people shot in New York City by
[02:36:28.033 --> 02:36:28.714]  By gunman?
[02:36:28.994 --> 02:36:30.655]  You think he'd have something to say about that?
[02:36:30.675 --> 02:36:31.696]  He'd blame the gun.
[02:36:32.157 --> 02:36:33.278]  He'd blame the gun culture.
[02:36:33.518 --> 02:36:39.203]  He's not blaming Islam or the Muslim culture for this repeated stampeding and death.
[02:36:39.743 --> 02:36:43.226]  It's just what we're seeing here today with the one world religion.
[02:36:43.286 --> 02:36:45.228]  What is behind the stampeding?
[02:36:45.268 --> 02:36:48.310]  I mean, isn't it just Mecca's letting too many people in?
[02:36:48.370 --> 02:36:51.173]  The Saudis are letting too many people into that side of Medina?
[02:36:52.731 --> 02:37:03.613]  They have a ceremony, the stoning of Satan, and it gets them worked up into a fury, and they have... people get stampeded because they start running over each other.
[02:37:03.633 --> 02:37:06.934]  It's a massive crowd, and just the lack of control.
[02:37:07.314 --> 02:37:14.715]  But I want to say this in terms of the preciousness of each life, because we heard that from all the different leaders of all these different religions today.
[02:37:15.136 --> 02:37:22.297]  If they really believed that, they would be standing at an abortion clinic, because there are more children that are killed each day with an abortion
[02:37:22.837 --> 02:37:25.579]  Then there were people who died here on 9-11.
[02:37:25.839 --> 02:37:30.522]  We have a 9-11 every day at abortion clinics, but this Pope can't be bothered to say that.
[02:37:30.562 --> 02:37:40.248]  When I was standing, taking pictures, we got the motorcade coming in earlier this morning at the UN, I heard people talking around me, and one of them said, this guy is great.
[02:37:40.328 --> 02:37:51.014]  Every time this Pope talks, he makes people understand the plight of those who have less than them, and he did a great job by not feeding the right-wing pro-lifers.
[02:37:51.615 --> 02:37:52.275]  You understand that?
[02:37:53.317 --> 02:37:59.966]  Feel sorry for people because they don't have as much money as you do, but don't feel sorry for them because they're having their life taken.
[02:38:00.326 --> 02:38:02.790]  That's the kind of calculus... Well, it's their religion.
[02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:04.051]  It's their religion.
[02:38:04.091 --> 02:38:07.516]  This is what they're pushing, and he's spouting classical...
[02:38:08.297 --> 02:38:12.038]  Marxism and then now all these leftists just love the Pope.
[02:38:12.318 --> 02:38:23.762]  See, they love a religion that pushes their idea because they're in a religion of collectivism that ends free will and ends language and makes you adopt their orthodox view of the world.
[02:38:24.956 --> 02:38:25.757]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:38:26.237 --> 02:38:39.387]  He had one other thing, too, I want to tell you, Alex, and that was when he met privately with the clergy, I believe it was a private meeting in Washington that this quote came out of, but he was talking to the church leaders that were there, and this is what he had to say to them.
[02:38:39.487 --> 02:38:50.795]  He said, many of you have suffered greatly in the not-too-distant past by having to bear the shame of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the church and the most vulnerable of her members.
[02:38:51.496 --> 02:38:52.136]  Do you catch that?
[02:38:52.696 --> 02:39:01.859]  The only thing he really had to say about the pedophile controversy within the Roman Catholic Church was, I'm sorry that some of you were embarrassed by being connected with that.
[02:39:02.539 --> 02:39:04.579]  He doesn't talk about the heinousness of this.
[02:39:04.859 --> 02:39:07.400]  And Alex, when I look at the way he's proud of people... He didn't personalize it.
[02:39:07.620 --> 02:39:11.301]  He just said, I'm sorry it embarrassed our thing.
[02:39:12.101 --> 02:39:13.621]  Yes, it embarrassed our institution.
[02:39:13.861 --> 02:39:15.642]  I'm sorry because you're part of the institution.
[02:39:15.922 --> 02:39:20.263]  But just like we see with the police, they don't purge the evildoers out of their midst.
[02:39:21.147 --> 02:39:22.968]  That is how you embrace corruption.
[02:39:23.008 --> 02:39:24.509]  That's how you propagate corruption.
[02:39:24.949 --> 02:39:28.470]  And I thought it was absolutely outrageous that that's the only thing that we've seen of that.
[02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:33.693]  If you want to talk about how you are there to help the children, then do something to help the children.
[02:39:33.833 --> 02:39:36.254]  Stop people from killing them and selling their baby parts.
[02:39:36.594 --> 02:39:38.955]  And stop people from molesting them sexually.
[02:39:39.255 --> 02:39:42.957]  Then we can have a conversation about what else you want to do to protect the children.
[02:39:43.217 --> 02:39:50.340]  But people need to understand that the thousands, tens of thousands of people, whatever, that are here, they need to understand that this
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:51.681]  It's completely epic!
[02:40:06.378 --> 02:40:09.920]  It's a Pope joins forces with Obama and Communist China to take over the world.
[02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:19.807]  This is a true axis of eugenics, a true axis of destroying any type of industrialization, clean industrialization around the world.
[02:40:19.847 --> 02:40:21.848]  Thank you so much, David Knight.
[02:40:21.868 --> 02:40:23.670]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:27.632]  I want to say, too, that no matter what happens, I'm not going anywhere.
[02:40:27.752 --> 02:40:28.773]  Jakari's not going anywhere.
[02:40:28.813 --> 02:40:29.614]  We're standing with you, Alex.
[02:40:30.134 --> 02:40:41.661]  Well, I know our audiences as well, and you know, this is from real sources, but they could also be telling these people this just to jerk our chain, and knowing we'll say it, so it'll scare the audience, but that's because they think we're cowards.
[02:40:42.441 --> 02:40:55.068]  We're not, and we always just disclose what's going on, and we get all these secret documents, we get all these great sources, and we get all these whistleblowers because we're crazy enough to put it out, and I've been through a lot of persecution before this.
[02:40:55.128 --> 02:40:57.050]  It's been kind of quiet the last few years, and
[02:40:57.970 --> 02:41:24.569]  I know I go after the White House all the time, and I point out what a fraud they are, and what liars they are, and you know, and I have Walter Jones and all these folks on trying to get the 28 pages released, and I go after the Saudis, and I go after, you know, you go after them, and we're really reaching over a billion people a month on social networks, hundreds of millions on the videos, tens of millions every week on the websites and the radio show, and it just really, really scares them, and they understand, hey, we take this guy out,
[02:41:25.939 --> 02:41:32.121]  It'll make him a martyr, but if we don't, he just keeps getting bigger because everything he talked about, everything his people talked about, is now out in the open.
[02:41:32.161 --> 02:41:33.241]  His credibility is going up.
[02:41:33.721 --> 02:41:36.322]  We can't just call him a kook who believes in Martians all day.
[02:41:37.402 --> 02:41:39.303]  And so, you know, I said it.
[02:41:39.343 --> 02:41:40.123]  I told you privately.
[02:41:40.163 --> 02:41:48.485]  I said launching this network and making the system more serious and having the fancy sets and sending reporters out is going to really get their attention.
[02:41:49.657 --> 02:41:51.378]  And is really going to have them, you know, do this.
[02:41:51.458 --> 02:42:10.391]  So we knew what we were doing and I believe out of whatever comes of this, we're only going to reach more people and it's going to be more effective because everything that's been done to me, stuff people wouldn't believe, I'm not going to get into it, it's off record, has just suddenly, when one door closes or something bad happens, all this good stuff happens.
[02:42:10.431 --> 02:42:16.936]  It's like angels come to our aid, the prayers, it is manifest destiny, it is providence and
[02:42:18.339 --> 02:42:21.480]  I'm just humbled to be part of this and to be in the middle of it and to see what's happening.
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:25.522]  That's why I tell you, the crew, you're part of something epic and big.
[02:42:25.542 --> 02:42:29.963]  I mean, a month ago, they crunched the numbers and said, Alex, it's a bigger audience.
[02:42:29.983 --> 02:42:31.164]  You're using two-year-old numbers.
[02:42:31.204 --> 02:42:31.984]  Here's the audience.
[02:42:32.044 --> 02:42:34.685]  And we look at it with computerized graphs.
[02:42:34.805 --> 02:42:36.206]  I mean, it's epic big.
[02:42:37.166 --> 02:42:52.872]  And it's getting bigger, and so we all better realize that we're part of something very serious, and we should all operate like this is our last day on air, our last article we're writing, our last video report, where we're really trying to lead people out of the New World Order.
[02:42:53.152 --> 02:42:54.632]  We're really trying to wake folks up.
[02:42:54.892 --> 02:42:56.053]  This is a huge epic battle.
[02:42:56.073 --> 02:42:58.534]  So God bless you, David, and I appreciate those kind words.
[02:42:58.574 --> 02:42:59.494]  And I've told David,
[02:43:00.234 --> 02:43:04.438]  Haven't I told you, David, that out of all these reporters, they're all doing a fabulous job.
[02:43:04.798 --> 02:43:10.063]  I'm trying to groom people who I think are smart as I am, or smarter, to continue on.
[02:43:10.083 --> 02:43:11.484]  Because I could die in a car wreck, David.
[02:43:11.784 --> 02:43:17.449]  So we've set things up regardless, and have contingency plans to continue this operation.
[02:43:17.469 --> 02:43:20.112]  I don't know, how many times have we discussed that, David?
[02:43:22.042 --> 02:43:23.363]  We're switching with Jakari right now.
[02:43:23.603 --> 02:43:26.546]  Once David gets back next week, we'll talk about some of that in studio.
[02:43:26.566 --> 02:43:32.350]  And if you want to know what I'm talking about, the video is up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:43:32.390 --> 02:43:38.515]  But please, I don't care whatever the cost is to me personally or to me physically.
[02:43:39.256 --> 02:43:40.397]  I care about
[02:43:42.347 --> 02:43:45.710]  Stopping the abortion of the partial birth abortion babies.
[02:43:46.250 --> 02:43:49.033]  I care about stopping putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:43:49.413 --> 02:43:50.894]  I care about getting the fluoride out.
[02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:52.215]  Stopping the geoengineering.
[02:43:52.736 --> 02:43:54.958]  I care about having a future for my children and your children.
[02:43:55.894 --> 02:43:57.395]  And there's no half measures here.
[02:43:57.776 --> 02:43:59.557]  We either tell it like it is or the enemy wins.
[02:44:00.137 --> 02:44:01.558]  You don't eat around the edges of this.
[02:44:01.598 --> 02:44:04.160]  This is so evil, you've got to stand against it.
[02:44:05.021 --> 02:44:11.626]  We have two big specials running right now that are great products and also finance this key operation.
[02:44:12.046 --> 02:44:20.413]  Brain Force is an amazing brain pill with like, what is it, 10 or 11 different ingredients that are, you know, just personally for me, they've done amazing things.
[02:44:20.913 --> 02:44:21.654]  One of the ingredients,
[02:44:23.883 --> 02:44:25.004]  is prescription in Europe.
[02:44:25.044 --> 02:44:26.725]  You can read all about it and find out why.
[02:44:26.745 --> 02:44:31.828]  There's a lot of brain enhancement supplements and things out there, but this simply is amazing.
[02:44:32.289 --> 02:44:35.150]  Brain Force available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:35.511 --> 02:44:37.512]  You can read the rave reviews right there on the site.
[02:44:38.373 --> 02:44:44.236]  Also, DNA Force that has one compound in it that is $40,000 a kilo.
[02:44:47.054 --> 02:44:49.316]  So, again, read all the facts for yourself.
[02:44:49.837 --> 02:44:51.419]  It's 20% off right now.
[02:44:51.959 --> 02:44:53.921]  Very expensive formula for us to put together.
[02:44:54.878 --> 02:44:58.321]  The most expensive product we have, ChildEase.
[02:44:59.242 --> 02:45:00.604]  Again, it's been made for over 20 years.
[02:45:00.624 --> 02:45:02.606]  We're one of the top organic manufacturers in the country.
[02:45:02.986 --> 02:45:05.969]  We just tweaked some of it to make our own formula and branded it ChildEase.
[02:45:05.989 --> 02:45:12.075]  It's got a bunch of natural herbs and compounds that I found helped focus me, and it helped me sleep better, but also calmer.
[02:45:12.976 --> 02:45:17.420]  It's a really amazing product, and your purchase, bottom line, funds the broadcast.
[02:45:18.570 --> 02:45:21.911]  Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine is a game changer.
[02:45:22.111 --> 02:45:23.992]  Iodine from the good halogen family.
[02:45:24.612 --> 02:45:25.633]  You've heard us break it down.
[02:45:25.673 --> 02:45:28.474]  You've heard us get into the fact that if you don't have iodine, you die.
[02:45:29.274 --> 02:45:31.315]  Iodine deficiency causes all sorts of problems.
[02:45:31.655 --> 02:45:32.856]  See the informational videos.
[02:45:32.916 --> 02:45:39.498]  Read more at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:45:39.879 --> 02:45:45.421]  And best we can tell, our sources wouldn't say, it looks like the attack may be against the supplements.
[02:45:45.441 --> 02:45:48.042]  But we've got two of the top lawyers, I mean the top in the country,
[02:45:48.522 --> 02:45:49.843]  We certify everything we say.
[02:45:49.883 --> 02:45:50.863]  We don't make claims.
[02:45:51.784 --> 02:45:53.525]  We just talk about what's personally happened to us.
[02:45:54.005 --> 02:45:58.227]  We talk about the basic science of nutrient deficiencies, things like that.
[02:45:58.787 --> 02:46:05.771]  Maybe they're coming after that to try to shut down some of our funding, but I can go just direct to appeals to the audience to donate dummies.
[02:46:06.571 --> 02:46:08.872]  I mean, you're not shutting us down.
[02:46:08.912 --> 02:46:12.154]  I predict if they actually try to take us down, it'll triple our revenue.
[02:46:12.654 --> 02:46:15.716]  I don't want that to happen because I don't want to be distracted with it.
[02:46:16.636 --> 02:46:17.758]  And it could be very distressing.
[02:46:17.818 --> 02:46:21.944]  That's why I haven't sued MSNBC saying lies about me and stuff, just because I don't have time to mess with it.
[02:46:21.964 --> 02:46:27.131]  I guess I quote a good Jesse Ventura quote, don't have time to bleed, but that's certainly true.
[02:46:27.151 --> 02:46:28.433]  So X2 is selling out.
[02:46:31.007 --> 02:46:32.128]  Knockout is back in.
[02:46:32.168 --> 02:46:32.909]  Great sleep aid.
[02:46:32.949 --> 02:46:33.850]  Certainly works for me.
[02:46:33.870 --> 02:46:37.613]  Has nine of the known compounds like Valerian Root and things like that.
[02:46:37.973 --> 02:46:43.298]  We have the Prostagard that has a bunch of other amazing products in it, not just the Saw Palmetto.
[02:46:43.638 --> 02:46:46.141]  So find out more at InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:50.163 --> 02:46:52.465]  And we can only run this until October 1st.
[02:46:53.165 --> 02:46:58.950]  The highest quality storable foods recently, you know, packaged very fresh from MyPatriotSupply.
[02:46:58.970 --> 02:47:06.456]  The special is dubbed InfoWars Select because by being private label we can even go below what their lowest prices are.
[02:47:07.376 --> 02:47:09.579]  So if you want to get storable foods, now is the time.
[02:47:09.939 --> 02:47:11.641]  The Mega Protein Kit is excellent.
[02:47:11.681 --> 02:47:14.524]  Six month supply, year supply, month supply.
[02:47:14.864 --> 02:47:18.308]  These are the lowest prices you will ever find.
[02:47:19.109 --> 02:47:21.892]  The Protein Mega Protein Kit is normally $127 and that's discounted.
[02:47:21.912 --> 02:47:22.793]  It's $99 right now.
[02:47:26.096 --> 02:47:27.237]  Uh, and there's no reviews of that.
[02:47:27.257 --> 02:47:28.418]  We need folks to get in there.
[02:47:28.498 --> 02:47:33.122]  I guess we have a... People are just down getting it, so... Uh, all the other areas obviously do have reviews.
[02:47:33.142 --> 02:47:36.666]  Uh, but InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:47:36.706 --> 02:47:38.607]  Alright, let's shift gears now to Jakari Jackson.
[02:47:42.751 --> 02:47:48.733]  Jacari Jackson, we're in front of the new Liberty Tower, where the World Trade Center were based before the events of 9-11.
[02:47:48.793 --> 02:47:51.694]  It's been following a bunch of powerful video reports.
[02:47:52.335 --> 02:47:57.957]  Jacari Jackson, what's front and center in your observance of the fiasco with the Pope?
[02:47:59.381 --> 02:48:01.523]  Shikari Jackson reporting from New York, New York.
[02:48:01.943 --> 02:48:08.329]  And as David touched, you know, we are watching while we're having our lunch break in a pizza parlor, the speech at the World Trade Center.
[02:48:08.429 --> 02:48:11.351]  And it's all these world leaders together of world religions.
[02:48:11.651 --> 02:48:13.553]  And on its face, you know, it does sound like a good thing.
[02:48:13.573 --> 02:48:15.615]  You know, everybody's coming here into unity.
[02:48:15.875 --> 02:48:23.421]  But if you go for a one world religion, it's not going to be one world Christianity or one world Islam or Hindu or anything that your religion may be at home.
[02:48:23.702 --> 02:48:27.545]  It's going to be this, you know, gumbo soup, all these different things.
[02:48:27.805 --> 02:48:29.266]  Yeah, talk about those amazing reports!
[02:48:50.851 --> 02:48:51.051]  Yes.
[02:48:51.491 --> 02:48:58.354]  Earlier this morning, we started out at the UN building, you know, as we expected, police blockades for several blocks in every direction.
[02:48:58.374 --> 02:49:02.796]  David and I split up temporarily so we could cover as much ground as possible.
[02:49:03.076 --> 02:49:08.719]  And while I was standing out there, you know, documenting all the things that were going on, the police blockades, the backchecks, all these type of things,
[02:49:09.439 --> 02:49:15.122]  Uh, actor Daniel Craig, you know, James Bond, I was standing there and I was like, that guy looks like, that is James Bond!
[02:49:15.482 --> 02:49:19.043]  And he walks over and I'm just, you know, watching him and I just, you know, go for it.
[02:49:19.083 --> 02:49:21.144]  I say, Mr. Craig, what do you think about the Pope being in town?
[02:49:21.164 --> 02:49:22.765]  He said, oh, it's great or something like that.
[02:49:23.145 --> 02:49:24.326]  It's very low audio.
[02:49:24.806 --> 02:49:25.826]  Whisper it pretty much to me.
[02:49:26.267 --> 02:49:29.448]  And now he was walking towards the, the, the, uh, UN Center.
[02:49:29.468 --> 02:49:32.649]  I'm not exactly sure if he went in, but he was moving around in that direction.
[02:49:32.689 --> 02:49:36.071]  But at the same time, there are many hotels or other places he could be going over there.
[02:49:36.451 --> 02:49:39.934]  And then David was out there getting some great footage as well, talking to the people.
[02:49:40.054 --> 02:49:41.555]  Many people came out to see the Pope.
[02:49:42.115 --> 02:49:46.198]  Thus far, the majority of the people that we've met, you know, have positive feelings about the Pope.
[02:49:46.218 --> 02:49:51.122]  But every now and again, we run into somebody who says, you know, I'm not exactly sure about, you know, what the agenda is.
[02:49:51.162 --> 02:49:55.986]  And it's not just about the Pope, but about the United Nations, about all these other world leaders that are coming in here.
[02:49:56.006 --> 02:50:00.689]  And it's like, I think there's more to this than is on the surface of this whole deal.
[02:50:01.029 --> 02:50:05.473]  And then yesterday, while we were still in DC, we were asking people, you guys may have
[02:50:06.113 --> 02:50:08.455]  The video David is talking about the worship service for the earth.
[02:50:08.635 --> 02:50:21.524]  Yeah, you know a lot of big I don't say big but they had a lot of a musical acts out there and David was telling me that like they expected the numbers to be in the thousands There's maybe a thousand people who out there, you know, of course David thousand
[02:50:21.984 --> 02:50:26.867]  200,000.
[02:50:22.344 --> 02:50:26.867]  Okay, so they anticipated the numbers for this event to be 200,000.
[02:50:26.987 --> 02:50:34.492]  Of course, there are many people at the Capitol, but at this musical event, you know, there's maybe a thousand or so people out there to hear this message of climate change.
[02:50:34.812 --> 02:50:42.337]  Everybody's saying that, oh, we have to do this for the Earth and name-dropping Leonardo DiCaprio and all these other shenanigans that were going on out there.
[02:50:42.577 --> 02:50:45.139]  But people need to realize, just like the people I talked to in the
[02:50:47.131 --> 02:50:49.672]  Alright, Jakari's Skype just broke up as we're going to break.
[02:50:49.692 --> 02:50:52.633]  We're going to come right back with him and have him finish that important point.
[02:50:53.293 --> 02:50:56.354]  But John Boehner is resigning at the end of October.
[02:50:56.394 --> 02:50:58.394]  He announced today a big victory.
[02:50:58.734 --> 02:51:02.576]  Some of the other news, Ontario moves to ban the term mother and father on government forms.
[02:51:03.156 --> 02:51:04.456]  Next they're going to ban it in school.
[02:51:04.796 --> 02:51:08.137]  More schools ban any type of contact sports.
[02:51:08.577 --> 02:51:09.698]  This is the prison state.

[02:54:19.294 --> 02:54:20.755]  And I think the top of our list
[02:54:23.513 --> 02:54:27.476]  It's providing for the safety and security of the American people.
[02:54:27.616 --> 02:54:29.418]  When are we going to defeat them?
[02:54:29.698 --> 02:54:35.442]  No, no, no, my nose is... That wasn't... No, it's not.
[02:54:35.582 --> 02:54:40.426]  What set you off that time?
[02:54:41.387 --> 02:54:46.911]  Making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream.
[02:54:48.072 --> 02:54:49.993]  I got it.
[02:54:50.113 --> 02:54:50.974]  It's important.
[02:55:00.635 --> 02:55:04.397]  I put my... myself through school.
[02:55:05.297 --> 02:55:07.938]  He always cries when he talks about himself.
[02:55:08.439 --> 02:55:09.819]  Every rotten job there was.
[02:55:09.839 --> 02:55:12.921]  I wanted to make sure every kid had the same chance in life.
[02:55:14.241 --> 02:55:17.022]  He cries when he's drunk.
[02:55:17.082 --> 02:55:18.763]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:19.223 --> 02:55:20.664]  Because there is a war on.
[02:55:21.164 --> 02:55:22.005]  For your mind.
[02:55:22.045 --> 02:55:24.246]  Oh my gosh, you should start crying.
[02:55:24.826 --> 02:55:26.647]  Put it back on script.
[02:55:30.165 --> 02:55:30.525]  That's all.
[02:55:31.646 --> 02:55:32.987]  He's got the tissue out.
[02:55:51.954 --> 02:55:53.115]  Well, the police lead her up there.
[02:55:53.155 --> 02:55:53.956]  It's totally staged.
[02:55:54.296 --> 02:55:55.777]  They just lie and say she broke through.
[02:55:56.458 --> 02:56:01.882]  And a lot more coming up with Rob Due, our news director, hosting The Fourth Hour.
[02:56:03.231 --> 02:56:11.175]  Salon's written a couple articles last week about pedophilia and pedophiles being nice people, so I'm very proud they've attacked me again.
[02:56:11.596 --> 02:56:18.059]  Alex Jones' wild-eyed Pope Francis attack breaking down the shock jock's latest unhinged conspiracy theory.
[02:56:18.659 --> 02:56:19.640]  And they say I'm wrong.
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:21.241]  The Vatican doesn't own the most land.
[02:56:21.281 --> 02:56:25.103]  It's the third biggest owner of land with 177 million acres.
[02:56:25.463 --> 02:56:28.765]  Well, yeah, I said Queen Elizabeth's number two and the Saudis number three.
[02:56:29.025 --> 02:56:32.527]  I've seen different numbers than you and the Vatican, admittedly, hides a lot of its wealth, okay?
[02:56:33.410 --> 02:56:37.273]  So the point is they got 177 million acres and trillions and trillions.
[02:56:37.813 --> 02:56:42.637]  They can take all the illegal aliens and pay for it, which they don't.
[02:56:42.657 --> 02:56:44.318]  Instead of telling me I need to.
[02:56:44.338 --> 02:56:45.319]  Okay?
[02:56:45.599 --> 02:56:46.219]  That's what I said.
[02:56:46.299 --> 02:56:46.880]  I'm sick of it.
[02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:47.760]  I'm sick of communists.
[02:56:48.161 --> 02:56:55.286]  Always big rich people want me to give my money to poor people so they can be their slaves on some global plantation cloward and pivot.
[02:56:56.087 --> 02:56:59.270]  Jakari Jackson, you got cut off by the break, my compadre.
[02:56:59.911 --> 02:57:02.654]  Just as a person, what do you make of this?
[02:57:02.694 --> 02:57:09.001]  I mean, the media's gone from attacking Catholics most of the time, because they were conservative, to just drooling over this guy.
[02:57:09.021 --> 02:57:12.084]  I mean, are you going to break down and cry if you see him?
[02:57:13.306 --> 02:57:14.727]  Oh, absolutely not, Alex.
[02:57:14.807 --> 02:57:20.732]  Like Dave was talking about the other day, how we were watching Fox News and they just would not say anything negative about the Pope.
[02:57:21.012 --> 02:57:26.997]  I'm not saying you have to attack the guy, but just Catholicism, you know, everybody, they had all these Catholics on to talk about how great it is.
[02:57:27.437 --> 02:57:33.042]  And like I said, it's not bashing Catholics, it's just like this one singular, we will not say anything negative about this guy.
[02:57:33.282 --> 02:57:34.823]  You know, just like they'll say something negative about Obama.
[02:57:34.843 --> 02:57:35.724]  Yeah, don't say anything about Jim Jones.
[02:57:35.804 --> 02:57:36.224]  It's a cult.
[02:57:36.244 --> 02:57:39.427]  I mean, would you agree that clearly he's becoming a cult leader?
[02:57:40.675 --> 02:57:40.975]  I don't
[02:58:02.836 --> 02:58:03.596]  That's a good question.
[02:58:24.645 --> 02:58:25.486]  He's absolutely right.
[02:58:25.766 --> 02:58:31.750]  But most of them are invaders that came into Syria, wanting to take over and get new houses and steal swimming pools, literally.
[02:58:32.251 --> 02:58:37.895]  And so, they're now being kicked out, so we're getting a bunch of jihadis from all over the Middle East.
[02:58:38.015 --> 02:58:41.757]  I mean, 76% in one way, 90-plus percent in another are military-age men.
[02:58:41.817 --> 02:58:43.299]  It turns out they're mainly jihadis.
[02:58:44.139 --> 02:58:48.081]  And so this is the defeated Al Qaeda army coming into Europe.
[02:58:48.681 --> 02:58:50.402]  Jakari, stay there back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:50.422 --> 02:58:51.443]  Some stations don't carry it.
[02:58:51.823 --> 02:58:53.484]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:53.824 --> 02:58:55.064]  Spread the word about the broadcast.

[02:58:56.385 --> 02:58:57.165]  And pray for us.
[02:58:57.385 --> 02:58:58.346]  We need those prayers.

[02:59:53.822 --> 02:59:56.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:13.248 --> 03:00:19.276]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:19.897 --> 03:00:22.881]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:29.116 --> 03:00:32.137]  Final segment that I am honchoing, captaining.
[03:00:32.157 --> 03:00:39.360]  And then we're going to have Rob Dew in the radio slash TV studio, the original studio, hosting the fourth hour.
[03:00:39.900 --> 03:00:42.822]  Jakari Jackson, you got cut off by the break again, my friend.
[03:00:43.542 --> 03:00:57.047]  You were getting into, just if you have logic, this guy that represents an organization worth hundreds of trillions, 177 million acres we know of, not mentioning Vatican Company subsidiaries, more like 300 million.
[03:00:57.267 --> 03:00:58.168]  But I've done my research.
[03:00:59.093 --> 03:01:03.535]  And they have debunking articles going, he's the third largest owner, not the first.
[03:01:03.615 --> 03:01:05.196]  Oh, you're discredited, Alex.
[03:01:06.236 --> 03:01:14.140]  Well, my point is, they're not taking any of these, quote, immigrants or migrants that in Syria would chop a Catholic's head off.
[03:01:14.180 --> 03:01:15.081]  I mean, this is sick.
[03:01:15.341 --> 03:01:15.701]  Go ahead.
[03:01:16.955 --> 03:01:23.501]  Oh, just like you said, they want everybody else to take care of people that they're encouraging to come to various countries.
[03:01:23.541 --> 03:01:27.144]  And as I said in the last segment, yes, some people have a very legitimate reason for fleeing.
[03:01:27.465 --> 03:01:40.176]  But when you have people like the Pope, like Obama, who are encouraging them to go to certain places, it's really ultimately their responsibility to take care of those people, especially people like Obama or other people who are going into other countries and causing a conflict.
[03:01:40.456 --> 03:01:41.196]  In the first place.
[03:01:41.516 --> 03:01:45.657]  And it's not just Obama, you have things with the Bushes as well, so it's not just him.
[03:01:46.057 --> 03:02:02.360]  But we have a long line of this going into other countries, messing them up, and then saying, oh, we can come here because we want to use... Yeah, and the very same politicians and the globalists that did that, and that won our guns, and that advertised the free anchor baby stuff, are the ones destabilizing the country, shifting gears, because it's a big story.
[03:02:03.161 --> 03:02:03.901]  I had one
[03:02:04.921 --> 03:02:06.582]  The informant is well known to threaten me.
[03:02:06.982 --> 03:02:09.243]  Then I had another FBI agent warn me about a year and a half ago.
[03:02:09.263 --> 03:02:11.003]  I told David and a few other people about it privately.
[03:02:11.023 --> 03:02:18.706]  And then I had another high level source say, no, I talked to somebody on the high level in the task force that they've been ordered by the White House to find something.
[03:02:19.566 --> 03:02:22.227]  And I mean, so this is real.
[03:02:22.267 --> 03:02:23.108]  This is going on.
[03:02:23.128 --> 03:02:25.969]  And I guess it's what we should expect in this corrupt country.
[03:02:26.029 --> 03:02:32.211]  But man, Jokari, what's your take on the news about Obama plans to shut down news organization if he can?
[03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:39.278]  Well, I definitely can understand they're looking at us because they want to take us down just like I was there a couple years ago.
[03:02:39.299 --> 03:02:47.249]  I think it was when I've been there about three or four months and the Secret Service shows up talking about something some guy wrote in a comment section on Planet Info Wars, I believe it was.
[03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:48.190]  I think so.
[03:03:15.553 --> 03:03:24.600]  Predictions that you made that came true, like before I started working for you Alex, I went back and watched some of your old, like, Mike Hanson archives type stuff and I saw you out there talking about how streetlights were looking at people.
[03:03:24.700 --> 03:03:25.761]  Well, that's not true and now...
[03:03:26.460 --> 03:03:26.900]  We're good to go.
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:57.961]  I know, I wish this stuff wasn't true.
[03:03:57.981 --> 03:04:02.822]  And in closing, Jakari, since you mention it, there are so many other examples of this.
[03:04:02.902 --> 03:04:06.964]  It's like, we had a guy death-threatening in the comments, so they show up here.
[03:04:07.004 --> 03:04:09.865]  They could have gone to the service that was doing it, you know, and gotten to where they're supposed to.
[03:04:10.685 --> 03:04:15.947]  And then they start, the FBI agent that called started asking me about the Obama deception that was about to come out.
[03:04:16.027 --> 03:04:20.149]  And then he starts calling around the office to other people, did we want to do something to Obama?
[03:04:20.669 --> 03:04:23.932]  So they just use that as an excuse to try to intimidate my staff.
[03:04:24.392 --> 03:04:25.413]  It's just crazy.
[03:04:25.793 --> 03:04:29.736]  I just wonder how they get these people, Jakari, to be this dirty.
[03:04:29.756 --> 03:04:31.337]  I mean, because that's dirty messing with us.
[03:04:32.278 --> 03:04:32.598]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:32.818 --> 03:04:35.601]  Like I said, any way they can, they're going to try to shut you down.
[03:04:35.981 --> 03:04:39.604]  But, you know, like I said, we kind of expect these type of things, like they have happened before.
[03:04:39.624 --> 03:04:41.926]  Any excuse they can, they're going to come after us.
[03:04:41.946 --> 03:04:45.028]  So we just try to be the best prepared that we can.
[03:04:45.368 --> 03:04:46.829]  Well, Jakari, I appreciate your courage.
[03:04:46.849 --> 03:04:48.270]  And there's also a lot of good people on the FBI.
[03:04:49.111 --> 03:04:50.811]  And that's why we know about this type of stuff.
[03:04:50.871 --> 03:04:51.732]  I'm going to point that out.
[03:04:51.772 --> 03:04:52.672]  Most of them are horrified.
[03:04:52.712 --> 03:04:54.412]  But they have a special unit out of D.C.
[03:04:54.472 --> 03:04:57.193]  They're the type of folks that brought you OKC.
[03:04:57.333 --> 03:04:58.813]  I mean, these are some nasty people.
[03:04:58.853 --> 03:04:59.974]  And just pray for us.
[03:05:00.294 --> 03:05:00.994]  Thank you, Jakari.
[03:05:01.014 --> 03:05:01.874]  Thank you for your courage.
[03:05:02.154 --> 03:05:03.274]  Got a wonderful... Thank you.
[03:05:03.314 --> 03:05:03.714]  Thank you.
[03:05:03.734 --> 03:05:04.475]  A wonderful team.
[03:05:04.515 --> 03:05:05.815]  And I praise God every day for them.
[03:05:06.455 --> 03:05:07.895]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[03:05:07.975 --> 03:05:09.776]  And Jesus is my rock.
[03:05:10.572 --> 03:05:13.275]  Over the weekend, Cheryl Atkinson released the following article.
[03:05:13.435 --> 03:05:16.398]  What the news isn't saying about vaccine autism studies.
[03:05:16.678 --> 03:05:21.884]  She starts off with a New England Journal of Medicine study that says there is no link between vaccines and autism.
[03:05:22.044 --> 03:05:27.269]  She then discloses the consulting firm behind the study, the Lewin Group, lists major vaccine makers among its clients.
[03:05:27.449 --> 03:05:31.834]  In fact, the Lewin Group's parent company, United Health Group, is a key government partner in Obamacare.
[03:05:31.974 --> 03:05:36.959]  And a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, QSSI, was given the contract to build the Obamacare website.
[03:05:37.119 --> 03:05:50.591]  She then looks at the AstroTurf propaganda campaign and some of the buzzwords they use, like weak, too small, haphazard, not replicated, junk science, flawed, unrelated, and how these words are used over and over again to attack anybody who questions the vaccine mafia.
[03:05:50.771 --> 03:05:55.934]  She then covers over 13 different studies that show a correlation between vaccine intake and brain damage.
[03:05:56.194 --> 03:06:01.657]  In fact, permanent brain damage is an acknowledged rare side effect of vaccines, and there's no dispute in that arena.
[03:06:01.777 --> 03:06:06.940]  So the next time your herd mentality friends are pushing vaccine propaganda in your face, shove this back in theirs.

[03:08:07.384 --> 03:08:17.948]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:22.108 --> 03:08:25.150]  All right, welcome to the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:25.170 --> 03:08:26.311]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:26.331 --> 03:08:27.392]  I'm your host, Rob Doo.
[03:08:28.393 --> 03:08:29.714]  And it's a pleasure to be here with you.
[03:08:29.734 --> 03:08:32.236]  We're going to talk about a little bit of Pope news here in the start.
[03:08:32.256 --> 03:08:35.878]  I'm going to take your calls in probably that short segment coming up after this segment.
[03:08:36.299 --> 03:08:41.382]  And then I've got some... Do you ever wonder what a Trump supporter looks like, sounds like, tastes like?
[03:08:41.502 --> 03:08:43.544]  Well, maybe not tastes like, but looks like and sounds like.
[03:08:43.564 --> 03:08:44.545]  We're going to have that for you.
[03:08:44.565 --> 03:08:49.748]  It's a report from Joe Biggs, who went to a Trump gathering in Dallas last week.
[03:08:50.959 --> 03:08:55.520]  And also, I'm going to look at some, I want to kind of end the week with some good news.
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:09:02.062]  Talking about the Russians released a image of the Earth that is really, it's stunning.
[03:09:02.782 --> 03:09:07.003]  They say it's the highest resolution image of the Earth from outside of the Earth.
[03:09:07.043 --> 03:09:07.763]  So we're going to show you that.
[03:09:08.063 --> 03:09:12.504]  And then some guys went out in the desert and kind of built a scale model of the solar system and time-lapsed it.
[03:09:12.944 --> 03:09:13.864]  Amazing film work.
[03:09:13.884 --> 03:09:15.605]  I'm going to give them some kudos and just talk about
[03:09:16.385 --> 03:09:25.910]  You know, we're all here on this earth together, and while we do have some differences, we definitely have to, and we have to point out the corruption, we do have to, at the end, work together to fix these problems.
[03:09:26.291 --> 03:09:31.914]  But first, before we get to all that, this came out of the AP today, and we posted it up on InfoWars.
[03:09:32.374 --> 03:09:38.177]  Immigration group planned Pope girl, planned girl's Pope encounter for a year.
[03:09:39.018 --> 03:09:43.921]  Now, I want to call your, the article of this came out in the Daily Mail.
[03:09:45.032 --> 03:09:47.675]  At 926 Eastern on the 24th.
[03:09:50.537 --> 03:09:52.899]  No, on 1747, so on the 23rd, I'm sorry.
[03:09:52.999 --> 03:09:54.240]  And then it was updated on the 24th.
[03:09:54.721 --> 03:09:57.003]  I posted a tweet the 23rd as soon as I saw this.
[03:09:57.203 --> 03:09:58.104]  I looked at the pictures.
[03:09:58.725 --> 03:10:02.628]  I said, does anyone else smell a hashtag BS, hashtag PR, hashtag stunt?
[03:10:02.668 --> 03:10:04.129]  I just happen to have a t-shirt and letter.
[03:10:05.010 --> 03:10:06.251]  And slip through security.
[03:10:06.731 --> 03:10:10.953]  Yeah, how do we have this multi-million dollar security apparatus around?
[03:10:10.973 --> 03:10:12.373]  This little girl happens to slip through.
[03:10:12.673 --> 03:10:17.715]  She's got a ready-made t-shirt, a very eloquent letter that she gave to the Pope.
[03:10:17.835 --> 03:10:19.156]  I think we have a B-roll of that.
[03:10:19.916 --> 03:10:21.117]  And then, who was it?
[03:10:21.397 --> 03:10:30.841]  Leo Zegami pointed out yesterday that the man actually holding the little girl up, the bald man there, is a Knights of Malta general, and he is one of the Pope's head of security.
[03:10:31.901 --> 03:10:32.582]  So it was all staged.
[03:10:32.622 --> 03:10:34.083]  Here it is out of the AP.
[03:10:34.543 --> 03:10:42.249]  Sophia Cruz's brief encounter with Pope Francis during his parade in Washington appeared to be a kind of spontaneous moment that is so enduring about the Pope.
[03:10:42.309 --> 03:10:46.293]  An initially hesitant young child wrapping an arm around his neck and he offers a kiss and a blessing.
[03:10:46.713 --> 03:10:52.638]  But five-year-old Sophie, the moment unfolded perfectly as it was scripted by members of a coalition of
[03:10:53.278 --> 03:10:54.940]  Of a Los Angeles-based immigrant rights group.
[03:10:55.300 --> 03:11:01.586]  They have been preparing for nearly a year for the young girl from suburban Los Angeles to make a dash to the Popemobile to deliver the message.
[03:11:02.267 --> 03:11:14.037]  Luckily, nobody decided to, you know, tase her or anything because people have been known, if you look at these places in the Mideast, when they do use children as suicide bombers, so it's not out of the ordinary that that could have happened.
[03:11:15.419 --> 03:11:19.883]  They even pulled off similar public relations coup a year ago in Rome using a 10-year-old girl with the Pope.
[03:11:20.244 --> 03:11:27.111]  We plan on doing this from the moment we learn he was coming to the United States as Juan Jose Gutierrez of Full Rights for Immigration Coalition.
[03:11:28.328 --> 03:11:33.030]  And, you know, he makes it act like, or sound like, that the U.S.
[03:11:33.070 --> 03:11:38.152]  doesn't even bring in anybody and any immigrants into the United States.
[03:11:38.492 --> 03:11:44.654]  Here's an article out of, I think it's the Washington Post, Pope calls for immigration leniency unlikely to change debate.
[03:11:46.010 --> 03:11:51.091]  And you go towards the end of this, we have a statement here from Representative Michael Burgess of Texas.
[03:11:51.571 --> 03:11:57.952]  The thing that always strikes me is when we get into these discussions is the United States takes in more people every year legally than the rest of the world combined.
[03:11:58.632 --> 03:11:59.893]  And we have the biggest prison population.
[03:11:59.913 --> 03:12:01.633]  We also take in the most immigrants.
[03:12:01.873 --> 03:12:04.013]  You start from that premise, it was 1.7 million last year.
[03:12:04.253 --> 03:12:08.374]  You want to add another 400 to 600,000 that came in without the benefit of doing it the right way.
[03:12:08.734 --> 03:12:09.634]  What is the right number?
[03:12:10.014 --> 03:12:13.255]  If over 2 million is not enough, would someone please tell me what the right number is?
[03:12:13.815 --> 03:12:16.899]  And I would encourage other countries to act accordingly.
[03:12:17.179 --> 03:12:20.063]  The Vatican for its part welcomes millions of visitors each year.
[03:12:20.083 --> 03:12:21.725]  I was one of them earlier this year.
[03:12:22.426 --> 03:12:28.554]  But always allows for a very slick few who meet the strict criteria to be admitted as residents or citizens.
[03:12:28.594 --> 03:12:29.335]  So they have
[03:12:29.895 --> 03:12:32.056]  High, high immigration laws in place.
[03:12:32.176 --> 03:12:36.197]  They have giant walls around their Vatican City, which is a sovereign nation.
[03:12:36.477 --> 03:12:37.597]  They have their own security.
[03:12:37.677 --> 03:12:39.938]  They don't go by any other laws except their own.
[03:12:40.358 --> 03:12:48.100]  They're able to cover things up that way, especially when it comes to pedophilia or gay sex with these priests.
[03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:52.521]  But we're supposed to take in everybody in the world, and we're racist if we don't do it.
[03:12:53.781 --> 03:12:54.901]  That's the story out there.
[03:12:54.941 --> 03:12:56.562]  There's some pictures of the wall.
[03:12:57.523 --> 03:12:59.305]  You know, look how high those are.
[03:12:59.485 --> 03:13:03.949]  That's a big ladder you're going to have to get or a giant tunnel.
[03:13:03.989 --> 03:13:06.491]  And it's all surrounded by roads and bridges.
[03:13:06.511 --> 03:13:10.554]  Let me tell you, Vatican City is an amazing place with what they've done with it.
[03:13:10.594 --> 03:13:14.978]  But that's what you do when you're able to take all the wealth and launder drug money and do all kinds of other things.
[03:13:16.101 --> 03:13:18.424]  And yet you basically don't have to face any laws.
[03:13:19.486 --> 03:13:22.169]  And so what's going on with this immigration crisis in Europe?
[03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:26.595]  Right now, Daily Mail is reporting rape and child abuse are rife in German refugee camps.
[03:13:26.795 --> 03:13:31.562]  Unsegregated conditions blamed as women are seen as fair game in overcrowded migrant centers.
[03:13:32.663 --> 03:13:44.599]  So, campaigners claim that they saw unaccompanied, that men there are seeing unaccompanied women as fair game and also they blame the conditions in which occupants were unsegregated by gender or nationality.
[03:13:44.639 --> 03:13:49.145]  They're just sticking people in fenced in areas and hoping they get along, but when you have
[03:13:50.310 --> 03:13:54.734]  If you can see the pictures for yourself, it's not a majority of families going into these centers.
[03:13:54.794 --> 03:13:56.415]  It's a majority of young males.
[03:13:56.596 --> 03:13:57.717]  And what are young males full of?
[03:13:57.737 --> 03:13:59.038]  They're full of testosterone.
[03:13:59.618 --> 03:14:00.659]  And that's what you're going to get.
[03:14:00.679 --> 03:14:05.964]  And then you have people that maybe lost their husbands, so they're fleeing women with their children.
[03:14:06.404 --> 03:14:07.765]  And they're being fair game.
[03:14:07.866 --> 03:14:13.230]  There's claims of child sex and rape among the women.
[03:14:13.290 --> 03:14:17.134]  So that's what's going on in Germany right now.
[03:14:17.694 --> 03:14:18.415]  Really makes you wonder.
[03:14:18.455 --> 03:14:27.407]  Now we have on InfoWars, oh going back to PopeKid, I encourage you to go watch the interview that David, or is it Darren McBreen and Kit Daniels did yesterday.
[03:14:27.447 --> 03:14:28.749]  PopeKid, What They Don't Want You To Know.
[03:14:28.789 --> 03:14:30.952]  That's up on InfoWars in our featured section.
[03:14:31.733 --> 03:14:35.278]  And a pretty funny moment there where Kit Daniels actually calls the Pope, Pope Marks.
[03:14:36.018 --> 03:14:47.182]  He has a Freudian slip because he is a Marxist wanting to have us live without air conditioning or TV or anything else that a modern society has.
[03:14:47.482 --> 03:14:50.964]  He's trying to sell the agenda that we should not have this.
[03:14:51.004 --> 03:14:54.345]  We should all live as one under the trees, I guess.
[03:14:54.785 --> 03:14:55.545]  But that's the thing.
[03:14:55.706 --> 03:15:04.669]  Humans have created this environment and we are liable for the pollution that we put out in this world, like the geoengineering that the Pope won't talk about.
[03:15:05.089 --> 03:15:06.370]  You know, that's never on the table.
[03:15:06.410 --> 03:15:12.372]  It's never geoengineering or fluoride in the water supply or the drugs that get into the water supply.
[03:15:12.392 --> 03:15:19.235]  There's all kinds of stuff that they put chemically into our bodies to change us, to keep us dumbed down and stupid.
[03:15:19.635 --> 03:15:21.536]  But I want to go now to a video.
[03:15:22.156 --> 03:15:24.458]  This is done by Jakari Jackson and David Knight.
[03:15:24.518 --> 03:15:28.200]  Public Rides buses so Pope can fly in a private jet.
[03:15:28.220 --> 03:15:34.324]  That's right, the Pope emits 572 tons of CO2 during his trip, but he's telling us we can't have air conditioning.
[03:15:34.865 --> 03:15:42.350]  Right now, the air conditioning seems to have frozen in this little studio, so maybe the Pope has prayed that InfoWars does not get its air conditioning as well.
[03:15:42.390 --> 03:15:43.511]  So let's go to that report.
[03:15:48.028 --> 03:15:55.165]  I accomplished so much good throughout the history of the United States.
[03:15:56.724 --> 03:15:58.965]  What did you think of the Pope's speech?
[03:15:59.025 --> 03:16:00.066]  It was fabulous.
[03:16:00.126 --> 03:16:02.727]  I'm not even Catholic, and I think he's wonderful.
[03:16:02.987 --> 03:16:04.608]  What do you think of his views on climate change?
[03:16:05.148 --> 03:16:05.889]  I support them.
[03:16:06.529 --> 03:16:08.410]  Yeah, I think enough's enough.
[03:16:08.590 --> 03:16:24.378]  I mean, I'm not somebody that's been a huge, huge advocate for climate change, but just seeing the people here today and hearing the Pope, you really realize that it's something we need to be very proactive with and take steps today to ultimately make a better tomorrow.
[03:16:25.138 --> 03:16:27.220]  And what are you doing to reduce your carbon footprint?
[03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:29.441]  I take the bus to work quite a bit.
[03:16:29.561 --> 03:16:30.522]  I'll take the train.
[03:16:30.982 --> 03:16:34.445]  Try not to drive into work when possible.
[03:16:35.126 --> 03:16:37.227]  And really focus on public transportation.
[03:16:37.627 --> 03:16:39.789]  And what will you do to reduce your carbon footprint?
[03:16:41.530 --> 03:16:42.311]  Recycling.
[03:16:43.271 --> 03:16:44.472]  I do that all the time.
[03:16:45.937 --> 03:16:46.917]  I'm driving a Prius.
[03:16:47.358 --> 03:16:53.259]  Well, okay, he didn't use the words climate change, and he didn't use the word climate once.
[03:16:54.060 --> 03:17:00.482]  He did speak on a lot of powerful things like poverty, the death penalty, just environmental degradation overall.
[03:17:01.762 --> 03:17:12.266]  I think he maybe might have done that to not step on people's feet, to let the ignorant be ignorant, but hear what he had to say, which is a start, which is more than nothing.
[03:17:15.186 --> 03:17:18.227]  We're more than happy to have been a part of this historical event today.
[03:17:18.347 --> 03:17:21.368]  Are you guys doing anything to lessen your carbon footprints?
[03:17:22.448 --> 03:17:23.608]  I mean, we took a bus here.
[03:17:23.628 --> 03:17:28.269]  There's like 50 of us that came from school, so we took one bus as opposed to multiple cars.
[03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:30.050]  We did that.
[03:17:30.110 --> 03:17:31.570]  We always turn our lights off.
[03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:32.951]  We always recycle too.
[03:17:33.151 --> 03:17:34.811]  We're doing environmental studies.
[03:17:34.871 --> 03:17:36.551]  We're environmental studies majors.
[03:17:37.672 --> 03:17:38.412]  And what else?
[03:17:38.472 --> 03:17:39.092]  Oh, we don't drive.
[03:17:40.137 --> 03:17:41.017]  Don't you ever drive?
[03:17:41.057 --> 03:17:42.078]  Is it just a temporary thing?
[03:17:42.338 --> 03:17:46.120]  I mean, I still don't know how to drive, so... Who knows, really?
[03:17:46.180 --> 03:17:48.101]  How old are you, do you mind?
[03:17:48.121 --> 03:17:48.181]  I'm 18.
[03:17:49.621 --> 03:17:49.801]  Yeah.
[03:17:50.182 --> 03:17:53.023]  Wow, those are some climate terrorists right there.
[03:17:53.103 --> 03:17:55.344]  They don't drive, they don't do anything.
[03:17:55.704 --> 03:17:58.165]  You know, they recycle, they turn off their lights.
[03:17:58.185 --> 03:18:06.289]  They're very good citizens, and they've been programmed like that since... I guess she's 18 now, that one girl was, so, you know...
[03:18:07.458 --> 03:18:19.994]  Late 90s she was born, definitely a millennial and that's what they've been doing is programming the younger generation so as they grow up they take these values and instill them in their kids and then that's how they change society.
[03:18:20.034 --> 03:18:25.380]  So it takes usually a generation or two or a generation and a half to make this happen but they're definitely working on it.
[03:18:26.348 --> 03:18:27.230]  Let's talk to my kids.
[03:18:27.270 --> 03:18:32.459]  My kids are not falling for the propaganda and we talk about it all the time.
[03:18:33.381 --> 03:18:35.084]  This morning the Pope was at the UN.
[03:18:35.124 --> 03:18:39.571]  He also went to the 9-11 memorial and did a multicultural
[03:18:41.827 --> 03:18:57.273]  Multicultural type religious ceremony with all the religions getting together to show that all religions are the same and can Well, who knows we're gonna see a report from David Knight later on about that But right now I want to get to his UN agenda is not about sustainability.
[03:18:57.313 --> 03:19:07.677]  It's not it's about total control and having a small pyramid of very very wealthy powerful people on top and lots of plebs underneath holding up
[03:19:08.418 --> 03:19:09.823]  The Golden Throne.
[03:19:09.923 --> 03:19:10.987]  So let's go to that report.
[03:19:18.063 --> 03:19:25.546]  I'm David Knight, and as we see from this perspective, we can see a little bit of the U.N., but of course you can see a lot more of the police.
[03:19:25.606 --> 03:19:31.948]  The perimeter extends two blocks on either side of the road, the 43rd Street that goes down to the U.N.
[03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:36.230]  And of course, you can't get any closer than 2nd Street, which is a couple blocks away.
[03:19:36.250 --> 03:19:37.771]  It's a huge perimeter they've put around here.
[03:19:38.251 --> 03:19:40.612]  Thousands and thousands of police officers.
[03:19:40.672 --> 03:19:41.872]  This is what it's come to.
[03:19:42.112 --> 03:19:43.413]  This is the total police state.
[03:19:44.053 --> 03:19:45.533]  But what is its ultimate objective?
[03:19:45.653 --> 03:19:47.994]  Its ultimate objective is not to protect one individual.
[03:19:48.014 --> 03:19:52.555]  Its ultimate objective is to set down a new agenda for sustainability.
[03:19:52.895 --> 03:19:53.556]  This is what the U.N.
[03:19:53.576 --> 03:19:56.016]  spokesmen on the news are openly saying.
[03:19:56.116 --> 03:19:56.636]  There it is.
[03:19:56.736 --> 03:19:58.517]  The new agenda for sustainability.
[03:19:58.537 --> 03:20:02.278]  You can watch that one at Public Rights Buses so Pope can fly in a private jet.
[03:20:02.658 --> 03:20:03.258]  Give me a call now.
[03:20:03.278 --> 03:20:03.318]  800-259-9231.

[03:22:17.816 --> 03:22:20.718]  that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.

[03:24:20.203 --> 03:24:21.123]  We are still live.
[03:24:21.143 --> 03:24:23.404]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:23.424 --> 03:24:24.925]  I'm your host Rob Dew.
[03:24:25.705 --> 03:24:39.211]  Sitting in here for the fourth hour we got a variety of hosts that come in here and do this and we're gonna be doing it from now on so if your radio station in your area is not carrying the fourth hour be sure you could give them a call and say hey Alex Jones is doing a fourth hour now let's get it on.
[03:24:40.257 --> 03:25:05.704]  And speaking of which, if you're also, if you have a local TV station in your area and you'd like to see them carry a TV broadcast of this show, also the InfoWars Nightly News, we have a, you can still go download a packet, information packet at InfoWars.com forward slash money bomb, scroll down a little bit, you download the PDF, you can send that to your TV station, get them to start carrying this, follow up with a phone call, follow up with an email, get your other friends to do it, when they see
[03:25:06.624 --> 03:25:12.240]  You know, when I'm looking at my emails, I see three people send me something, I go, whoa, this must be pretty important.
[03:25:12.421 --> 03:25:14.105]  Three different people sent it to me, I'm gonna check it out.
[03:25:15.362 --> 03:25:18.783]  And sometimes if you put a good headline in your email it helps as well.
[03:25:19.523 --> 03:25:22.644]  We got interrupted in the break by the UN agenda not about sustainability.
[03:25:22.664 --> 03:25:36.589]  I'm not going to finish that report but go check it out on our YouTube channel or you can find it on the article public rides buses so Pope can fly in a private jet and there's the two lovely ladies who are riding buses to maintain a low carbon footprint and they don't even drive.
[03:25:36.769 --> 03:25:37.890]  They don't know what freedom is.
[03:25:38.010 --> 03:25:41.931]  Freedom is about traveling around to where you want to go not being stuck on a bus line.
[03:25:42.331 --> 03:25:44.532]  What if you want to go on the road less traveled?
[03:25:45.888 --> 03:25:47.589]  Also, I'm going to take your phone calls right now.
[03:25:47.649 --> 03:25:50.111]  We have Charles from Georgia.
[03:25:50.131 --> 03:25:51.151]  Looks like he's been holding the longest.
[03:25:51.171 --> 03:25:52.072]  Let's talk about the Pope.
[03:25:52.432 --> 03:25:53.313]  Charles, what's going on?
[03:25:54.694 --> 03:25:55.954]  How you doing, Mr. Rob?
[03:25:56.195 --> 03:25:56.535]  I'm doing good.
[03:25:56.555 --> 03:25:58.676]  This is Charles from the Nation of Truth.
[03:25:59.277 --> 03:26:01.158]  And I just called in.
[03:26:01.478 --> 03:26:02.679]  I'm just curious about this Pope.
[03:26:02.699 --> 03:26:03.960]  We've been hearing a lot about him.
[03:26:04.780 --> 03:26:08.382]  And he's got a lot of cult followers behind him.
[03:26:09.463 --> 03:26:10.624]  Let me ask you, could he be
[03:26:11.368 --> 03:26:22.787]  The Pope, which is the false prophet, that could usher in the false messiah because all these people that are worshiping him could be the same people that worship the false messiah.
[03:26:23.168 --> 03:26:24.450]  I just want to get your take on that.
[03:26:25.492 --> 03:26:27.313]  Well, that's the thing about a cult of personality.
[03:26:27.713 --> 03:26:42.743]  It is hard to judge, and I think a lot of people are growing up, and when they grow up, especially if they're Catholic or Christian, they're brought into this mindset of the Pope is all-powerful, and that's the end of the line for Christianity right there, is the Pope.
[03:26:43.184 --> 03:26:44.665]  And so he's always held in reverence.
[03:26:45.754 --> 03:26:49.619]  And I think you have a lot of people who buy into what he's saying.
[03:26:49.679 --> 03:26:55.126]  A lot of people agree with him on these environmental policies that he wants to implement.
[03:26:55.746 --> 03:26:57.048]  And that's the agenda.
[03:26:57.729 --> 03:26:59.011]  It all goes to the training.
[03:26:59.031 --> 03:27:01.594]  But is this guy the false prophet?
[03:27:01.714 --> 03:27:02.815]  Is he the antichrist?
[03:27:03.956 --> 03:27:04.476]  Who knows?
[03:27:04.697 --> 03:27:07.699]  He's probably just another hatchet man for the New World Order.
[03:27:08.559 --> 03:27:11.441]  He's just bringing it in slowly but surely.
[03:27:11.521 --> 03:27:14.163]  Now the next Pope will get a little more draconian on environment.
[03:27:14.203 --> 03:27:16.104]  He'll say, hey, you don't even need houses.
[03:27:16.144 --> 03:27:22.208]  We should all just be living in tents because a house uses a lot of energy and we don't need to be using this energy.
[03:27:22.228 --> 03:27:27.452]  So they'll have us scattered about in fields or in giant camps somewhere.
[03:27:27.492 --> 03:27:29.213]  So I guess I hope that answers your question, Charles.
[03:27:29.253 --> 03:27:29.953]  Thanks for calling.
[03:27:30.454 --> 03:27:32.035]  Next up is Frank in New York.
[03:27:32.095 --> 03:27:33.095]  Let's talk about immigration.
[03:27:33.135 --> 03:27:33.716]  Frank, how you doing?
[03:27:35.273 --> 03:27:36.194]  Hey Ron, how are you?
[03:27:36.454 --> 03:27:36.894]  I'm fine.
[03:27:38.435 --> 03:27:38.715]  Great.
[03:27:39.255 --> 03:27:45.839]  If you look at the MIAC report, it actually does state that if you're against immigration, you're considered a terrorist.
[03:27:46.339 --> 03:27:47.420]  If you're against immigration?
[03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:47.420]  2009.
[03:27:47.580 --> 03:27:47.860]  Wow.
[03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:50.481]  Yeah, on the MIAC report.
[03:27:50.561 --> 03:27:51.202]  Yeah, look it up.
[03:27:51.822 --> 03:27:53.503]  Oh, I know about the MIAC report.
[03:27:54.083 --> 03:27:55.784]  Yeah, I'm going to pull it up right now.
[03:27:55.804 --> 03:27:55.884]  Yeah.
[03:27:59.457 --> 03:28:05.381]  And it actually does state that, like I said again, it's unredeemed, that if you're against immigration, you are a terrorist.
[03:28:05.841 --> 03:28:09.683]  You are against the, you know, support of what they want.
[03:28:09.703 --> 03:28:11.945]  Can you tell me what page it's on?
[03:28:11.965 --> 03:28:13.065]  I'm bringing up an old article.
[03:28:13.526 --> 03:28:14.706]  Secret State Police Report.
[03:28:14.766 --> 03:28:17.688]  Ron Paul, Bob Barr, Chuck Baldwin, Libertarians Are Terrorists.
[03:28:17.708 --> 03:28:19.829]  It's from 2009, written by Kurt Nemo.
[03:28:21.771 --> 03:28:22.371]  Hold on a second.
[03:28:24.456 --> 03:28:26.357]  I'm going to keep you on hold.
[03:28:26.397 --> 03:28:27.619]  When you have that, let me know.
[03:28:27.639 --> 03:28:29.180]  Because I'll pull it up.
[03:28:29.520 --> 03:28:30.261]  Is it on screen right now?
[03:28:30.301 --> 03:28:30.701]  There it is.
[03:28:30.841 --> 03:28:31.102]  Okay.
[03:28:31.982 --> 03:28:34.805]  Opposition to illegal immigration and income tax resistance.
[03:28:35.666 --> 03:28:36.186]  There it is.
[03:28:37.007 --> 03:28:37.507]  Right there.
[03:28:37.548 --> 03:28:40.931]  Christian identity, white nationalism, militant anti-abortion activists.
[03:28:41.591 --> 03:28:50.636]  Also, so you people making videos about the anti-abortion activists, or about the cutting up of baby parts and selling them, you might be terrorists.
[03:28:50.716 --> 03:28:54.419]  In fact, they're probably going to come after those groups putting those videos together.
[03:28:54.459 --> 03:28:55.479]  Frank, thanks for bringing that up.
[03:28:55.519 --> 03:28:56.260]  That is important.
[03:28:56.340 --> 03:29:00.902]  So this has been on the agenda since 2009, at least, probably before.
[03:29:01.383 --> 03:29:04.044]  Aaron, you want to talk about the Pope and the UN?
[03:29:04.244 --> 03:29:04.865]  What's on your mind?
[03:29:06.305 --> 03:29:10.608]  Yeah, just first, for like 10 seconds, I have a real good cause that everybody should check out.
[03:29:11.118 --> 03:29:15.340]  It's back on our feet at GoFundMe.com with some good folks.
[03:29:15.520 --> 03:29:23.464]  The actual website is GoFundMe.com forward slash T-N-4-W-B-V-D-S.
[03:29:24.385 --> 03:29:28.187]  And I really encourage people to check that out.
[03:29:28.207 --> 03:29:31.669]  Alright, what's on your mind with the Pope?
[03:29:31.789 --> 03:29:36.091]  This Pope thing is... I don't know about other people out there, but...
[03:29:36.841 --> 03:29:37.121]  It is.
[03:29:37.322 --> 03:29:39.384]  I have like the weirdest feeling in my stomach.
[03:29:40.024 --> 03:29:44.949]  And you got the... I mean... Aaron, I got a weird feeling we're up on a break.
[03:29:44.989 --> 03:29:45.890]  Sorry to cut you off.
[03:29:46.310 --> 03:29:47.812]  I will try to get to you in a second.
[03:29:47.832 --> 03:29:48.753]  Just hang tight there, buddy.
[03:29:49.353 --> 03:29:50.895]  You're watching the 4th Hour of Overdrive.
[03:29:50.915 --> 03:29:52.957]  It's Infowars.com Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:59.934 --> 03:30:02.935]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.875 --> 03:30:06.656]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.596 --> 03:30:12.797]  Kay Daniels, InfoWars.com.
[03:30:12.857 --> 03:30:15.738]  Did you know that Pope Francis has strong ties to communism?
[03:30:15.978 --> 03:30:22.219]  Francis is a member of the Jesuits who developed the so-called liberation theology, which many have labeled Christianized Marxism.
[03:30:22.439 --> 03:30:26.580]  They're the reason why communism and socialism has persevered for so long in Latin America.
[03:30:26.880 --> 03:30:32.782]  And it's not a coincidence that Cuba's current leader, Raul Castro, praised Pope Francis for his anti-capitalist stance.
[03:30:33.043 --> 03:30:35.744]  Castro, like Francis, was also brought up by the Jesuits.
[03:30:36.044 --> 03:30:41.286]  Starting to make sense now why Francis is constantly calling for carbon taxes and more government?
[03:30:41.526 --> 03:30:44.267]  And also, did you know the recent reconciliation between the U.S.
[03:30:44.307 --> 03:30:47.548]  and Cuba was spearheaded by Pope Francis to the benefit of Castro?
[03:30:47.789 --> 03:30:55.932]  Vatican researcher Leo Zagami wrote an excellent article on InfoWars.com entitled, Vatican Flag to Fly Over the New World Order, which breaks it all down.
[03:30:56.212 --> 03:31:06.298]  Zagami wrote, Barack Obama and Raul Castro's mandalist leftist agenda is guided and supervised by the first Jesuit Pope in history to help the Cubans embrace the new world order with enthusiasm.
[03:31:06.398 --> 03:31:10.080]  Keep checking InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv for more reports.
[03:31:10.360 --> 03:31:13.582]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:13.862 --> 03:31:18.865]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:31:18.865 --> 03:31:19.325]  We're good to go.
[03:31:40.231 --> 03:31:41.152]  Brain Force is here.
[03:31:41.332 --> 03:31:43.435]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:43.535 --> 03:31:48.301]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[03:31:48.541 --> 03:31:51.685]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:51.825 --> 03:31:55.009]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:55.330 --> 03:31:57.012]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:57.312 --> 03:31:58.192]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[03:31:58.212 --> 03:31:59.132]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:59.392 --> 03:32:01.273]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:32:01.393 --> 03:32:08.874]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:32:09.915 --> 03:32:17.076]  Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to be able to bring you the hands-down best deal we've ever offered on high-quality storable foods.
[03:32:17.396 --> 03:32:25.838]  Infowarsstore.com is now partnering with the top-of-the-line storable food company, My Patriot Supply, to bring you the highest quality, freshest,
[03:32:26.098 --> 03:32:31.039]  Longest lasting, most affordable, storable foods at the lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[03:32:31.199 --> 03:32:33.660]  My goal is to find the best deals and bring it to you.
[03:32:33.820 --> 03:32:41.062]  For a limited time until October 1st, they're allowing us to offer the lowest price on food they've ever given to the public.
[03:32:41.322 --> 03:32:47.483]  Now is the time in the next week to take action and to secure your pantry for any emergency.
[03:32:47.623 --> 03:32:51.364]  Visit InfoWarsSelect.com or InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:32:51.644 --> 03:32:55.047]  Everybody who knows me knows that I get emotional about certain things.
[03:32:55.087 --> 03:32:56.348]  And I think the top of our list
[03:33:23.456 --> 03:33:27.399]  It's providing for the safety and security of the American people.
[03:33:27.560 --> 03:33:29.381]  When are we going to defeat them?
[03:33:29.481 --> 03:33:29.822]  No, no, no.
[03:33:29.842 --> 03:33:30.802]  My nose is running.
[03:33:30.862 --> 03:33:32.564]  No, it's not.
[03:33:32.604 --> 03:33:41.331]  What set you off that time?
[03:33:41.352 --> 03:33:46.836]  Making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream.
[03:33:47.837 --> 03:33:48.418]  High five.
[03:33:49.779 --> 03:33:50.940]  It's important.
[03:33:59.337 --> 03:34:04.362]  I put my... myself through school.
[03:34:06.884 --> 03:34:09.766]  Working every rotten job there was.
[03:34:09.786 --> 03:34:12.869]  I wanted to make sure every kid had the same chance in life.
[03:34:14.590 --> 03:34:16.932]  And I could do that.
[03:34:16.952 --> 03:34:18.734]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:19.174 --> 03:34:20.635]  Because there is a war on.
[03:34:21.116 --> 03:34:22.037]  For your mind.
[03:34:22.397 --> 03:34:24.198]  Oh my gosh, you should start crying.
[03:34:25.019 --> 03:34:26.380]  Put it back on screen.
[03:34:27.822 --> 03:34:32.963]  I certainly don't want the institution to go through this.
[03:34:34.003 --> 03:34:34.863]  Poor Boehner.
[03:34:35.084 --> 03:34:38.704]  Resigned today under pressure from Walter Jones and others.
[03:34:38.744 --> 03:34:43.285]  We had Walter Jones earlier on the show today breaking all that down with Alex.
[03:34:43.485 --> 03:34:50.787]  And that's just amazing that we finally are getting rid of John Boehner, but they will be replacing Boehner with somebody else.
[03:34:51.943 --> 03:34:54.586]  Probably equally as bad, another acolyte of evil.
[03:34:56.047 --> 03:35:03.374]  Now before we show you what a Trump supporter looks like, which I'm very interested to see, well, we have 20% off Brain Force right now.
[03:35:03.394 --> 03:35:06.818]  You can talk to Anthony, Alex, or both on this.
[03:35:06.838 --> 03:35:08.319]  I started taking it a couple days ago.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:09.360]  Boom!
[03:35:09.440 --> 03:35:13.084]  It wakes you up really quickly and not in a jittery sort of way, but just...
[03:35:14.025 --> 03:35:15.085]  You're just more alert.
[03:35:15.446 --> 03:35:16.506]  More alert looking around.
[03:35:16.526 --> 03:35:22.908]  And if you're watching me now, I'm showing you how I look around alertly after taking Brain Force.
[03:35:22.929 --> 03:35:24.269]  And also ChildEase is back.
[03:35:25.129 --> 03:35:25.870]  Very popular.
[03:35:26.410 --> 03:35:35.153]  It's a pretty big bottle of liquid that you can give to your kids to help calm them down, especially in this world where kids can get distracted very easily.
[03:35:35.173 --> 03:35:36.474]  I want to read a couple comments here.
[03:35:37.423 --> 03:35:38.964]  This is from Button in Canada.
[03:35:39.004 --> 03:35:40.504]  Helped me focus in a calm, natural way.
[03:35:40.524 --> 03:35:42.365]  So I guess Button takes it as an adult.
[03:35:42.725 --> 03:35:46.127]  I take it with Supermail Vitality and other InfoWars combinations.
[03:35:46.147 --> 03:35:47.668]  This is by Carl in the UK.
[03:35:48.088 --> 03:35:48.868]  Does what it says.
[03:35:49.048 --> 03:35:49.889]  Regular customer.
[03:35:50.069 --> 03:35:51.769]  Never been let down.
[03:35:52.430 --> 03:35:57.472]  So try ChildEase if you have some children or even maybe try it on yourself if you're an adult.
[03:35:57.512 --> 03:36:00.193]  See if it helps you calm your nerves.
[03:36:00.293 --> 03:36:01.154]  Gets you focused.
[03:36:02.014 --> 03:36:03.236]  And also try BrainForce.
[03:36:03.276 --> 03:36:10.628]  It's all 20% off with BrainForce right now at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:36:11.430 --> 03:36:13.874]  Now Trump is leading in the polls still, 26%.
[03:36:16.112 --> 03:36:24.574]  Carly Fiorina is trailing now 16%, and this is a poll done, it looks like, by a New Hampshire primary poll.
[03:36:24.794 --> 03:36:25.774]  It's from CNN.
[03:36:26.194 --> 03:36:31.035]  And then it's followed by Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich.
[03:36:31.055 --> 03:36:34.136]  Of course, they don't mention Rand Paul anywhere.
[03:36:35.536 --> 03:36:36.356]  Rand Paul at 3%.
[03:36:36.396 --> 03:36:38.137]  They do finally mention him down there.
[03:36:38.917 --> 03:36:40.760]  Joe Biggs put this together back on the 14th.
[03:36:41.381 --> 03:36:52.176]  He went to the Trump rally in Dallas and he interviewed a lot of Trump supporters and here's what they sound like and what is on their mind, which I think is pretty interesting.
[03:36:52.677 --> 03:36:53.358]  So here's that report.
[03:36:58.109 --> 03:37:00.230]  I'm gonna sit here and take it anymore.
[03:37:34.508 --> 03:37:38.930]  So they're all cheering for Joe Biggs right there, who's showing his Hillary for Prison 2016 t-shirt.
[03:37:39.070 --> 03:37:41.652]  And people want pictures with it.
[03:37:41.852 --> 03:37:42.512]  It's pretty amazing.
[03:37:42.572 --> 03:37:45.014]  Why do you support Donald Trump?
[03:37:45.034 --> 03:37:46.234]  American veterans.
[03:37:46.254 --> 03:37:47.075]  American veterans?
[03:37:47.135 --> 03:37:48.075]  What else?
[03:37:48.175 --> 03:37:49.956]  He's just great for this country.
[03:37:50.116 --> 03:37:51.217]  He's gonna make a change.
[03:37:51.937 --> 03:37:54.199]  We need a change in the White House now.
[03:37:54.379 --> 03:37:55.839]  And you can't beat Trump.
[03:37:55.859 --> 03:37:57.880]  I'm here to support Donald Trump.
[03:37:58.521 --> 03:38:00.562]  So why do you support Donald Trump?
[03:38:02.236 --> 03:38:07.200]  I think he can keep us all employed and create new jobs.
[03:38:07.800 --> 03:38:07.981]  Oh boy.
[03:38:16.124 --> 03:38:17.085]  I think it could, yes.
[03:38:17.605 --> 03:38:18.466]  I like him a lot.
[03:38:19.086 --> 03:38:20.707]  I also like Jeb Bush.
[03:38:20.827 --> 03:38:24.670]  And the more I can learn about the two different positions.
[03:38:24.810 --> 03:38:30.034]  Although I will say I'm warming up to Trump more and more than I see him.
[03:38:30.054 --> 03:38:33.016]  I appreciate his candidness, his blunt talk.
[03:38:33.456 --> 03:38:43.886]  I'm here because I love Donald Trump and it's great to be at a patriotic event with a bunch of people who also feel the same way about our country.
[03:38:53.114 --> 03:38:59.079]  I'm hoping to see some young people, too, because we really need to get on the ball and fix this country.
[03:38:59.159 --> 03:39:05.204]  And we need someone who's going to get down to the root of it, get down to the main problem, and just go from there.
[03:39:05.285 --> 03:39:11.690]  And someone who knows how to win, which obviously, he says all the time, he knows how to win and be successful.
[03:39:11.790 --> 03:39:14.012]  I'm an immigrant from Canada that did it right.
[03:39:14.092 --> 03:39:18.416]  I've been here for nine years and I don't have any documents because the government's oppressed me.
[03:39:19.258 --> 03:39:29.823]  They've done a lot of damage to my life, but I'm here to help Donald Trump campaign so he can make my situation right so I can help America.
[03:39:29.843 --> 03:39:31.643]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[03:39:31.843 --> 03:39:34.004]  Now we're standing outside of the American Airlines Center.
[03:39:34.324 --> 03:39:35.925]  Donald Trump just gave his speech.
[03:39:36.225 --> 03:39:39.107]  How are you guys feeling tonight after listening to Donald Trump's speech?
[03:39:39.407 --> 03:39:39.927]  Feeling good.
[03:39:40.187 --> 03:39:45.769]  I was skeptical at first about having a comedian as the president, but it was fun.
[03:39:45.789 --> 03:39:46.910]  I think he can do a good job.
[03:39:47.210 --> 03:39:47.870]  I'm feeling great.
[03:39:48.030 --> 03:39:48.510]  I liked it.
[03:39:48.791 --> 03:39:49.571]  I got a good time.
[03:39:49.591 --> 03:39:51.912]  He was entertaining, but he did hit some of the issues.
[03:39:51.992 --> 03:39:52.672]  Are you all for him?
[03:39:53.872 --> 03:39:55.113]  I like what he's doing.
[03:39:55.193 --> 03:39:57.894]  I would lean more towards the Ted Cruz.
[03:39:57.974 --> 03:39:59.534]  He said, like, the anchor babies.
[03:39:59.894 --> 03:40:02.295]  People don't know that's not in the Constitution.
[03:40:02.775 --> 03:40:03.555]  It's not right.
[03:40:03.655 --> 03:40:05.956]  There's a lot of things, but I think what he's doing is great.
[03:40:05.976 --> 03:40:07.977]  It's bringing out a great conversation.
[03:40:08.337 --> 03:40:11.218]  He's changing the way that the politics are being run.
[03:40:11.798 --> 03:40:12.418]  I'm all for it.
[03:40:12.639 --> 03:40:13.959]  Trump's amazing in person.
[03:40:14.019 --> 03:40:17.581]  It's like if you take what you see on TV and then multiply that by 10.
[03:40:18.162 --> 03:40:25.906]  And if two words to describe the way Trump comes across in person I guess would be authentic and spontaneous.
[03:40:26.546 --> 03:40:33.330]  So it's so different from most of the Washington politicians who we'd describe as more rehearsed and following a script.
[03:40:33.370 --> 03:40:38.593]  Whereas Trump's presentation is spontaneous, it seems real, it seems genuine, and it seems unscripted.
[03:40:39.013 --> 03:40:43.176]  So when you came to this event tonight, how did you feel about Donald Trump before this?
[03:40:43.736 --> 03:40:45.377]  I've already been a fan of his.
[03:40:45.437 --> 03:40:46.778]  I like what he's been saying.
[03:40:48.179 --> 03:40:52.942]  I think he's bringing up a lot of issues that a lot of other people don't have the guts to actually bring up.
[03:40:53.562 --> 03:40:54.483]  And he's opening up the field.
[03:40:54.503 --> 03:40:56.144]  But I think I'm going to vote for him no matter what.
[03:40:56.724 --> 03:40:57.164]  What about you?
[03:40:57.545 --> 03:40:58.326]  I feel the same.
[03:40:58.686 --> 03:41:05.493]  We're from New York, so we like his bravado and the way he, you know, like, says things that no one else will.
[03:41:05.813 --> 03:41:09.417]  Donald, like, attacks Democrats and, like, says how he really feels, and I like that.
[03:41:09.557 --> 03:41:13.040]  Behind me, there's a large group of anti-Trump protesters out here.
[03:41:13.401 --> 03:41:17.044]  The police are starting to move the line of people back this way.
[03:41:17.505 --> 03:41:20.228]  Starting to get pretty hectic, so let's go see what's going on real quick.
[03:41:20.248 --> 03:41:20.408]  Come on.
[03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:30.250]  Wow, check this out, hey.
[03:41:32.813 --> 03:41:36.917]  Hey, so if you're just now getting here, there's a lot of stuff going on outside of the Trump protest.
[03:41:45.886 --> 03:41:48.628]  So as you can see, the police lines are starting to push back.
[03:41:48.989 --> 03:41:51.131]  There's a lot of people with Mexican flags.
[03:41:54.616 --> 03:41:54.776]  Quiet!
[03:41:54.836 --> 03:41:55.097]  Quiet!
[03:41:55.137 --> 03:41:55.237]  Quiet!
[03:41:55.277 --> 03:41:55.437]  Quiet!
[03:42:12.677 --> 03:42:27.712]  So there you got the Dallas PD was out there with their dancing horses keeping the protesters at bay those who think Trump is a racist because he's saying things that a lot of things he's saying I think need to be said and you don't get politicians saying this stuff because
[03:42:29.053 --> 03:42:33.878]  There's no money in keeping illegal immigration out of this country.
[03:42:33.898 --> 03:42:34.758]  There's no money in that.
[03:42:35.239 --> 03:42:39.903]  And so I really like Trump's stance on illegal immigration, except for building the wall.
[03:42:40.303 --> 03:42:42.004]  But that's a very interesting video.
[03:42:42.024 --> 03:42:43.285]  We're going to post that on InfoWars.
[03:42:43.306 --> 03:42:45.067]  I think Liam McAdoo might even play it tonight.
[03:42:45.527 --> 03:42:51.673]  Just gives you a real insight onto the Trump supporter and what he or she is all about.
[03:42:52.273 --> 03:42:56.276]  Now I want to change gears, really, and I'm going to make a 180 right now.
[03:42:56.936 --> 03:42:57.937]  This is out of Gizmodo.
[03:42:58.037 --> 03:43:00.639]  This is the definitive photograph of planet Earth.
[03:43:02.140 --> 03:43:06.243]  And this is unlike NASA's Blue Marble, which was a composite for many different photographs.
[03:43:06.663 --> 03:43:09.705]  This is a portrait of Earth taken in one single shot.
[03:43:09.745 --> 03:43:11.567]  It's the highest resolution image of our home planet.
[03:43:11.587 --> 03:43:12.107]  121 megapixels.
[03:43:12.127 --> 03:43:13.248]  And it was shot by the Russians.
[03:43:18.658 --> 03:43:24.439]  So it was a Russian satellite that shot that and I think that is a very beautiful image of our Earth.
[03:43:25.240 --> 03:43:28.600]  The reds coming out of the deserts are really amazing.
[03:43:28.661 --> 03:43:30.241]  I mean, that is just deep color.
[03:43:30.301 --> 03:43:30.781]  Look at that.
[03:43:31.481 --> 03:43:32.882]  That's the planet we live on, folks.
[03:43:32.942 --> 03:43:36.462]  That's where all this craziness is going on.
[03:43:36.582 --> 03:43:38.263]  All this craziness that we've created.
[03:43:39.628 --> 03:43:47.871]  And then I want to follow that up with, we posted this on InfoWars earlier in the week, a scale model of the solar system in the Nevada desert.
[03:43:48.531 --> 03:43:56.233]  So a couple filmmakers wanted to recreate a scale model of the entire solar system and they used an earth the size of a marble.
[03:43:56.693 --> 03:43:59.634]  The filmmakers are Wiley Overstreet and Alex Garoche.
[03:44:00.394 --> 03:44:05.496]  So we're going to go through a few of their, they put one video up, it's about an eight minute video, but I'm going to play some excerpts of it and analyze it.
[03:44:05.816 --> 03:44:09.097]  So this first video is why they decided to pull this off.
[03:44:09.991 --> 03:44:15.633]  If you look up an image of the Earth and Moon, you're going to get a picture where they're quite close together.
[03:44:16.654 --> 03:44:17.314]  Something like that.
[03:44:18.214 --> 03:44:24.837]  But in reality, the Earth and Moon are about that far apart.
[03:44:25.157 --> 03:44:27.999]  That is the Earth and the Moon to scale.
[03:44:29.545 --> 03:44:32.327]  Taking the same concept but for the solar system.
[03:44:33.167 --> 03:44:38.151]  Every single picture of the solar system that we ever encounter is not to scale.
[03:44:38.791 --> 03:44:46.536]  If you put the orbits to scale on a piece of paper, the planets become microscopic and you won't be able to see them.
[03:44:49.292 --> 03:44:54.776]  So our solar system is vast, that is to say the least, especially when you get to those outer planets.
[03:44:55.296 --> 03:45:10.727]  So what they did was they went out to the Black Rock Desert and they placed the sun, it was about a two meter ball, and then they started tracing out the orbits that these planets make, and they're not all circular, some of them are elliptical, and they attached little lights to these, and I'm gonna show you first the inner planets.
[03:45:10.747 --> 03:45:17.292]  So I hope you're watching at infowars.com forward slash show so you can actually see how beautiful the orbits are in time-lapse fashions.
[03:45:17.312 --> 03:45:18.773]  Let's roll the inner planets.
[03:45:19.373 --> 03:45:26.175]  We have 36 hours to measure the distances, trace out the orbits, and set up a time-lapse shot from up on top of a nearby mountain.
[03:45:30.195 --> 03:45:37.617]  To create a scale model with an Earth only as big as this marble, you need 7 miles of empty space.
[03:45:40.718 --> 03:45:41.458]  So that's why we're here.
[03:45:46.997 --> 03:45:50.421]  Once the time-lapse is ready, we'll drive each orbit with a light.
[03:45:50.441 --> 03:45:54.826]  Hopefully you'll be able to tell just how big they really are.
[03:45:58.611 --> 03:46:00.013]  Onward to the outer planets!
[03:46:02.677 --> 03:46:13.283]  So that was the inner planets, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and then Mars, and then we have the asteroid belt, and then we have the outer planets, of which they do neglect to use Pluto, which was a planet when I was a kid.
[03:46:13.363 --> 03:46:14.524]  Now it's not a planet anymore.
[03:46:15.064 --> 03:46:16.685]  But it's got moons, but it's not a planet.
[03:46:17.486 --> 03:46:20.928]  Anyway, here's a look at the outer planets, and then all the orbits all together.
[03:46:20.948 --> 03:46:23.069]  So I hope you're watching Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:46:23.129 --> 03:46:28.452]  If you can't watch it now, this will be up on YouTube on the Alex Jones Channel in a few hours, so you can check it out then.
[03:46:28.492 --> 03:46:30.013]  But here is the outer planets.
[03:46:40.376 --> 03:46:44.138]  That tiny light out there is our Sun, just over a mile away.
[03:46:44.838 --> 03:46:51.621]  So that was Saturn they just showed.
[03:46:51.701 --> 03:46:54.062]  Here's Uranus.
[03:46:56.243 --> 03:46:57.144]  Much bigger orbit.
[03:46:57.184 --> 03:47:01.506]  I mean, these are beautiful time lapses of just how vast our solar system is.
[03:47:03.542 --> 03:47:09.527]  And finally they're going to end with Neptune, which is way out there, seven miles away from the Sun with this scale model.
[03:47:13.330 --> 03:47:20.396]  And that is with the Earth the size of a marble and the Sun the size of a two meter balloon.
[03:47:20.476 --> 03:47:23.699]  I mean, that's where we live, people.
[03:47:25.180 --> 03:47:26.281]  And everything works together.
[03:47:26.481 --> 03:47:29.663]  All these planets also have their own gravity that work
[03:47:30.723 --> 03:47:46.710]  In conjunction with the sun's gravity and it all has an effect on us somewhere or another and that's what we have to realize that we are all on this really small planet living together and we may not all get along all the time but we all have to live here and if
[03:47:48.146 --> 03:47:58.810]  Muslims have to make room for Christians and Christians have to make room for Muslims as long as they're respecting each other's space and laws and I mean that's pretty much all I got to say about that.
[03:47:59.210 --> 03:48:16.156]  The final video here is the astronauts who have they interviewed some of the astronauts who talked who have seen the earth from orbit and here's what they had to say and he also ends with a little term that Alex likes to use how we're just a small little ball floating in space so I really wanted to get that out there and here's that last clip.
[03:48:18.062 --> 03:48:21.444]  There are 24 people in the entire history of the human species.
[03:48:21.785 --> 03:48:28.049]  Billions of people who have actually seen the full circle of the Earth with their own eyes.
[03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:33.254]  Following the breakfast, the astronauts went to the suit room where they donned their spacesuits.
[03:48:33.454 --> 03:48:35.776]  This is man's attempt to get to the moon.
[03:48:36.016 --> 03:48:37.437]  Zero.
[03:48:37.457 --> 03:48:39.418]  We have liftoff.
[03:48:39.478 --> 03:48:40.359]  Liftoff at 751.
[03:48:41.360 --> 03:48:43.802]  In Earth orbit, the horizon is just slightly curved.
[03:48:44.682 --> 03:48:53.770]  When you head on out to the moon, that horizon slowly curves around and upon itself, and all of a sudden you're looking at something that's very strange, but is very, very familiar.
[03:48:53.790 --> 03:48:57.073]  Oh my God, look at that picture over there.
[03:48:57.113 --> 03:48:58.154]  Wow, isn't that pretty?
[03:48:58.174 --> 03:49:02.458]  You can put your thumb up, and you can hide the Earth behind your thumb.
[03:49:03.920 --> 03:49:05.181]  Everything that you've ever known.
[03:49:06.364 --> 03:49:07.485]  All behind your thumb.
[03:49:08.525 --> 03:49:10.126]  Not any bigger than that, way up there.
[03:49:10.826 --> 03:49:12.327]  It's really beautiful.
[03:49:13.387 --> 03:49:14.248]  You can cry.
[03:49:18.189 --> 03:49:21.111]  That's what I really wanted to try and capture.
[03:49:22.511 --> 03:49:24.932]  We are on a marble floating in the middle of nothing.
[03:49:26.673 --> 03:49:30.655]  When you sort of come face to face with that, it's... it's staggering.
[03:49:35.208 --> 03:49:45.160]  It sure is staggering and that's kind of the message I guess for the weekend when you're out there and either supporting Trump or supporting the Pope or out there protesting some event.
[03:49:45.701 --> 03:49:48.884]  We just all have to remember we all are living on this planet together.
[03:49:48.905 --> 03:49:51.988]  It's very important to point out government corruption whenever you can.
[03:49:52.028 --> 03:49:52.969]  That's how I feel.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:50:02.926]  And the people of Catalonia are actually kind of done with paying for everybody in the rest of the country of Spain and they want to vote for independence.
[03:50:03.046 --> 03:50:06.248]  It looks like they're on their path of voting for independence.
[03:50:06.288 --> 03:50:09.951]  When I was in Barcelona, there were Catalonia flags everywhere.
[03:50:10.151 --> 03:50:13.613]  Everybody was flying them and that was one thing people did want to talk about, although
[03:50:14.608 --> 03:50:16.029]  Nobody want to talk about anything on camera.
[03:50:16.049 --> 03:50:23.352]  I think they're afraid of those new Spanish laws where if you speak out, show pictures of police, anything like that, you could get fined or arrested.
[03:50:23.372 --> 03:50:27.213]  Aaron, are you still there and are you ready to make your comment on the Pope?
[03:50:29.434 --> 03:50:30.595]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[03:50:30.615 --> 03:50:31.455]  Alright, go for it.
[03:50:32.799 --> 03:50:39.342]  Yes, the zip code on that real quick is 64079 at operation back in our seat.
[03:50:39.802 --> 03:50:48.086]  But the Pope, it's just, I'm sitting there watching him on ABC, first on NBC, and they don't have a translator, so I switch over to ABC.
[03:50:48.866 --> 03:50:58.631]  And I just get like this really weird feeling, no matter if it was yesterday when he was with the President, or today in New York, or you know, probably in Philadelphia also.
[03:50:59.358 --> 03:51:00.419]  All right, hold on, Aaron.
[03:51:00.439 --> 03:51:02.360]  You've got a long-winded explanation.
[03:51:02.400 --> 03:51:03.120]  We're going to break.
[03:51:03.140 --> 03:51:03.520]  We'll be back.
[03:51:03.601 --> 03:51:06.602]  Liam McAdoo is going to tell us what's going on in the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[03:51:06.942 --> 03:51:07.843]  It's the Overdrive Hour.
[03:51:07.863 --> 03:51:09.604]  This is Rob Doo hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[03:51:09.624 --> 03:51:10.244]  Thanks for watching.
[03:51:11.045 --> 03:51:18.409]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[03:51:18.709 --> 03:51:21.610]  That often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[03:51:22.110 --> 03:51:25.871]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[03:53:09.940 --> 03:53:14.143]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:53:14.363 --> 03:53:18.245]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in Omega-3s?
[03:53:18.405 --> 03:53:25.588]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% Omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:53:25.768 --> 03:53:30.790]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?

[03:53:42.875 --> 03:53:43.135]  I think so.

[03:54:17.876 --> 03:54:19.877]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[03:54:20.037 --> 03:54:21.417]  and now to 3 p.m.

[03:54:47.467 --> 03:54:49.328]  We are sending it out into space.
[03:54:49.368 --> 03:54:51.509]  So let's look and see what's going on at InfoWars right now.
[03:54:51.529 --> 03:54:53.729]  Got top three articles here on our featured section.
[03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:55.710]  Feminist vs. Facts and Logic.
[03:54:55.810 --> 03:54:57.030]  This is gonna get ugly.
[03:54:57.070 --> 03:55:02.472]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article and it follows the adventures of the slut walk girl.
[03:55:02.512 --> 03:55:03.032]  What's her name?
[03:55:03.092 --> 03:55:03.872]  Lauren Southern.
[03:55:04.712 --> 03:55:06.853]  And so it should be some... I have not watched those videos yet.
[03:55:06.893 --> 03:55:07.953]  It just went up a little bit ago.
[03:55:08.433 --> 03:55:11.954]  Ontario moves to ban mother-father on government forms.
[03:55:12.575 --> 03:55:12.955]  Person?
[03:55:13.075 --> 03:55:13.375]  Person?
[03:55:14.616 --> 03:55:16.179]  E-O-E-A?
[03:55:17.201 --> 03:55:17.722]  Documents.
[03:55:17.862 --> 03:55:20.387]  British government spied on everyone's web activity.
[03:55:20.447 --> 03:55:22.131]  Targeted internet radio listeners.
[03:55:22.652 --> 03:55:22.732]  Ah!
[03:55:23.556 --> 03:55:30.840]  Of course we knew that was going on, and joining me now in studio is Leanne McAdoo to talk about what's coming up on the nightly news.
[03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:31.801]  Leanne, what do you have coming up?
[03:55:32.241 --> 03:55:38.765]  Well, we're definitely going to be speaking about that particular article as well, because it's not just InfoWars that's being targeted.
[03:55:38.865 --> 03:55:48.390]  Anyone with a dissenting opinion, and even if you don't have a dissenting opinion, even if they're going to pre-crime you and see if you are a potential criminal or a potential
[03:55:50.233 --> 03:55:50.573]  I think so.
[03:56:16.212 --> 03:56:16.952]  The man's a pro.
[03:56:17.233 --> 03:56:18.513]  He knows how to talk.
[03:56:18.573 --> 03:56:24.076]  And speaking of that, we have James from California who wants to talk on the FBI raid, and then we'll get to the crying game with Boner.
[03:56:24.536 --> 03:56:25.276]  James, how's it going?
[03:56:26.337 --> 03:56:26.577]  Hey, good.
[03:56:26.597 --> 03:56:27.357]  How are you guys doing?
[03:56:27.518 --> 03:56:27.958]  Doing great.
[03:56:27.978 --> 03:56:29.058]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[03:56:29.078 --> 03:56:31.379]  Yeah, I turned on the computer today.
[03:56:31.439 --> 03:56:35.181]  I've been busy working, but I saw that article and it made me jump out of my seat.
[03:56:35.201 --> 03:56:42.545]  First, I want to say Yahoo for raising that money and going satellite and link up.
[03:56:43.534 --> 03:56:47.695]  I got my butt cheated by my wife for spending too much money buying a bunch of stuff from you guys.
[03:56:48.396 --> 03:56:50.456]  The good thing is you can use the stuff, you know?
[03:56:50.496 --> 03:56:50.996]  Right.
[03:56:51.016 --> 03:56:51.576]  That's great.
[03:56:51.676 --> 03:56:53.417]  Some of it was for her.
[03:56:53.477 --> 03:56:54.617]  I got her the brain for it.
[03:56:54.677 --> 03:57:01.399]  She's going to college right now, getting her degree and working, so I figured she needed the extra booze.
[03:57:01.639 --> 03:57:03.080]  That's a thoughtful husband.
[03:57:04.440 --> 03:57:05.901]  And I stocked up on the super meal.
[03:57:06.021 --> 03:57:07.581]  That makes it even more wonderful, right?
[03:57:07.861 --> 03:57:08.141]  Uh-oh.
[03:57:09.282 --> 03:57:10.282]  Do you guys have kids yet?
[03:57:11.667 --> 03:57:13.348]  Yeah, we do have a five-year-old, actually.
[03:57:13.368 --> 03:57:15.389]  You might be getting more kids.
[03:57:16.730 --> 03:57:18.411]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:57:18.651 --> 03:57:24.033]  So I live in San Francisco, which is the most corrupt city, probably, in the country.
[03:57:24.774 --> 03:57:37.340]  And anyways, I saw this article, it freaked me out, so I'm just wondering if you guys got, not being discussed on the air, but there's a plan, you know, to protect you guys, because if something went down, it'd be really bad.
[03:57:37.360 --> 03:57:38.361]  It'd be bad for everybody.
[03:57:39.250 --> 03:57:41.451]  And I think Alex can appreciate that.
[03:57:41.491 --> 03:57:57.276]  But I grew up as an athlete, played football my whole life, all through school, put myself through college, and there's this drill where you're surrounded by your teammates, and you're in the middle of this circle, and everyone gets a number, and they call out a number, and they come out and just, you know, whack you on.
[03:57:57.816 --> 03:57:59.357]  And that's how I feel like, you know,
[03:57:59.963 --> 03:58:03.667]  Being in this info war is that we're just getting attacked from every position.
[03:58:03.687 --> 03:58:05.028]  You know, the 12 o'clock, the 6 o'clock.
[03:58:05.068 --> 03:58:05.588]  Exactly.
[03:58:05.649 --> 03:58:07.370]  We have to be ready, and we are ready.
[03:58:07.390 --> 03:58:10.373]  We do have contingency plans in place if anything were to happen.
[03:58:11.214 --> 03:58:12.335]  Join us tonight, 7 p.m.
[03:58:12.375 --> 03:58:12.675]  Central.
[03:58:12.715 --> 03:58:14.857]  Leigh Ann McAdoo, you're going to be talking about Boehner, right?
[03:58:15.218 --> 03:58:19.122]  Yeah, more on Boehner, resigning from the most powerful position in government.
[03:58:19.242 --> 03:58:21.244]  I'm sure it's because he's... No, I can't.
[03:58:22.245 --> 03:58:22.485]  Please.
[03:58:24.122 --> 03:58:25.803]  And we'll play that crying game video again.
[03:58:25.823 --> 03:58:28.405]  His crying face is almost as bad as Kim Kardashian's.
[03:58:28.565 --> 03:58:29.525]  God, it's disgusting.
[03:58:30.306 --> 03:58:31.707]  That just about wraps it up for today.
[03:58:31.727 --> 03:58:34.808]  I'm your host Rob Doo, doing the fourth hour of Overdrive.

[03:58:37.830 --> 03:58:38.531]  7 p.m.
[03:58:38.571 --> 03:58:39.591]  Central for the nightly news.

[03:58:48.757 --> 03:58:49.337]  Thanks for watching.
[03:58:53.366 --> 03:58:57.248]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:59:00.489 --> 03:59:05.511]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life vitamin B12 formulation.
[03:59:05.631 --> 03:59:11.533]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[03:59:11.753 --> 03:59:13.634]  Methocobalamin, the same kind used in B12
