[00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:07.854]  Media spin fail artist Susan Rice has done it again.
[00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:20.221]  You may recall how Rice declared on five mainstream media interview shows that the Benghazi attack was a result of rioting due to the horribly produced and nefarious film Innocence of the Muslims.
[00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:33.473]  What happened this week in Cairo, in Benghazi, and many other parts of the region, a direct result of a heinous and offensive video that was widely disseminated that the U.S.
[00:00:33.493 --> 00:00:34.975]  government had nothing to do with.
[00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:39.559]  Or how about this doozy from the United States National Security Advisor?
[00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.466]  Sergeant Bergdahl, there are a lot of questions about how he originally was captured and whether or not he had deserted, had left his post.
[00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:46.747]  Is that going to be investigated?
[00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:51.853]  And if it's found that he did indeed leave his post, will he be disciplined or has already paid the price?
[00:00:52.153 --> 00:00:54.556]  He served the United States with honor and distinction.
[00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:55.077]  Ms.
[00:00:55.137 --> 00:00:56.739]  Rice has stepped in it again.
[00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.892]  The sanctions will be suspended and Iran will begin to be able to access its frozen accounts around the world.
[00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:05.613]  What do we think they'll spend that money on?
[00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:11.555]  We think for the most part they're going to need to spend it on the Iranian people and their economy which is tanked.
[00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:23.159]  And in fact we should expect that some portion of that money would go to the Iranian military and could potentially be used for the kinds of bad behavior that we have seen in the region up until now.
[00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:33.287]  This admission opens up the floodgates to scathing criticism of the highly unpopular deal the Obama administration, NATO dubbed a historic breakthrough, made with Iran.
[00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:44.996]  Over a hundred billion dollars worth of frozen Iranian assets are to be thawed due to the deal that has Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu deeming it a historic mistake.
[00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:51.321]  While the negotiators were closing the deal in Vienna, Iran's supposedly moderate president,
[00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.450]  I think?
[00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.702]  It happened four days ago.
[00:02:13.102 --> 00:02:20.286]  An official spokesman cited by the Saudi Arabian Press Agency also said, But of course the reckless hubris of the Obama administration would have us ignore this.
[00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.192]  To the North and South and West, a cry is heard.
[00:02:41.232 --> 00:02:42.636]  Death to America!
[00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:52.620]  Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, outlined four major problems with the Iran deal.
[00:02:52.881 --> 00:03:00.367]  First, Iran now has a vast nuclear infrastructure and a history of deceiving IAEA inspectors for years.
[00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:11.916]  This is not the hoped-for dismantle-for-dismantle deal in which the sanctions regime would be dismantled in exchange for the dismantling of Iran's nuclear weapons making capability.
[00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:12.477]  Second,
[00:03:12.757 --> 00:03:16.961]  The temporary restrictions placed on Iran expire in 10 years.
[00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:21.005]  Iran could be a hulking beast of terrorist activity by then.
[00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:26.531]  Third, the nuclear arms race will be galvanized in the most dangerous region on earth.
[00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:34.979]  And finally, the deal transfers to the Iranian regime's coffers $150 billion that is now frozen in foreign bank accounts.
[00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.362]  Iran has a $300 billion to $400 billion economy.
[00:03:39.743 --> 00:03:46.588]  A $150 billion cash bonanza for the regime is the equivalent of $8 trillion flowing into the U.S.
[00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:47.109]  Treasury.
[00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:58.438]  Tens of billions are likely to flow to the Shiite militias in Iraq, the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and other Iranian terror proxies in the region.
[00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:11.089]  Billions more will go to strengthening Iran's global terror network, which it has used to perpetrate terror attacks on five continents and more than 30 cities, from Buenos Aires to Burgas, Bulgaria to Bangkok.
[00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:26.922]  I continue to be much more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon going off in Manhattan, which is part of the reason why the United States, showing its continued
[00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:30.445]  I want to make this announcement now.
[00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.606]  It's going up as we speak a day early.
