[00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:17.933]  A major survey has revealed that American confidence in all three branches of government has reached record lows.
[00:00:18.293 --> 00:00:23.177]  The 2014 General Social Survey has mined the political climate for 40 years.
[00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:29.862]  Their studies now show that only 23% of Americans have a great deal of confidence in the Supreme Court.
[00:00:30.182 --> 00:00:32.584]  A meager 11% in the executive branch
[00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:36.045]  And a pitifully dismal 5% in Congress.
[00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:41.127]  American confidence in the Supreme Court is reaching a record 40 year low.
[00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:43.888]  2 in 10 have zero confidence in the Supreme Court.
[00:00:44.348 --> 00:00:47.969]  Just 3% of Republicans have confidence in the President.
[00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.090]  While Democrats have dropped from 25% in 2010 to 18% in 2014.
[00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.510]  And Congress?
[00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.030]  Well, Congress is a sick joke to most Americans.
[00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:08.958]  A very, very sad day when we have to make a Hobson's choice of either funding our national security or standing for the Constitution.
[00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:19.904]  Confidence was almost non-existent, with 7% of Democrats, 5% of Independents, and 3% of Republicans with a great deal of confidence.
[00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:26.948]  First of all, any conversation I have with these Senators, or Senator Mendez or anyone else,
[00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:29.379]  I do my best to make them private.
[00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.140]  If that's how they're initiated, that's how they should stay.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.663]  Senator Menendez has done a stalwart job as chair of the committee, and as far as I'm concerned, he's been an outstanding senator.
[00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:43.846]  45 years ago, 25% of Americans expressed a great deal of confidence in the press.
[00:01:44.186 --> 00:01:50.729]  Now, 7% of Americans have confidence, while 44% have no confidence at all.
[00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.631]  And 1 American in 10 has confidence in television.
[00:01:55.211 --> 00:02:07.297]  A recent Gallup poll named government as the number one problem in the United States, with the economy in general a close second, unemployment and jobs, immigration, health care, terrorism at sixth.
[00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:14.461]  America's frustration with our backdoor dealing entitled and detached elected leaders is fast approaching the breaking point.
[00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.822]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:02:24.298 --> 00:02:32.142]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.483]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:37.285]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:02:37.345 --> 00:02:41.447]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment, and pushes Obamacare.
[00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:44.908]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:02:44.928 --> 00:02:52.192]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:56.495]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:58.357]  We are the true media.
[00:02:58.497 --> 00:03:01.099]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.862]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
