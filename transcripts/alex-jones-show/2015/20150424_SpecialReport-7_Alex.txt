[00:00:07.386 --> 00:00:25.931]  Back in May of 2012, while America slept, an amendment overturned the long-standing Smith-Montt Act of 1948 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to be released within U.S.
[00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:26.591]  borders.
[00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.013]  Michael Hastings of BuzzFeed.com put it this way.
[00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:39.439]  The new law would give sweeping powers to the State Department and Pentagon to push television, radio, newspaper, and social media on to the U.S.
[00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:40.019]  public.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.323]  It removes the protection for Americans, says a Pentagon official who is concerned about the law.
[00:00:45.876 --> 00:00:49.620]  It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information.
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.701]  There are no checks and balances.
[00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:56.826]  No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.
[00:00:57.327 --> 00:01:09.378]  A WikiLeaks archive released recently reveals that the government is actively working with the corporate media to produce the sort of propaganda required to shape the foreign policy narrative of the United States.
[00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:20.449]  Within the trove lies ample evidence detailing a growing close relationship between the Obama Administration, the State Department, and the transnational entertainment corporation, Sony.
[00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.574]  The archive demonstrates Sony Corporation's connections to the U.S.
[00:01:24.614 --> 00:01:26.176]  military-industrial complex.
[00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:28.658]  An email from Richard Stengel, U.S.
[00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:40.850]  State Department Undersecretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, reveals how the government enlisted Sony and other entertainment corporations in the propaganda war against ISIS and Russia.
[00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:43.893]  It is addressed to Sony's Michael Linton.
[00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:44.834]  It reads,
[00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:47.256]  It was great to see you yesterday.
[00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:55.182]  As you could see, we have plenty of challenges encountering ISIL narratives in the Middle East, and Russian narratives in Central and Eastern Europe.
[00:01:55.663 --> 00:02:06.051]  In both cases, there are millions and millions of people in those regions who are getting a skewed version of reality, and it's not something that the State Department can do on its own, by any means.
[00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:15.338]  Following up on our conversation, I'd love to convene a group of media executives who can help us think about better ways to respond to both of these large challenges.
[00:02:15.658 --> 00:02:21.445]  This is a conversation about ideas, about content and production, about commercial possibilities.
[00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:25.088]  I promise you it will be interesting, fun, and rewarding.
[00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:36.401]  Michael Linton responded to this email by sending Stengel a list of names including Andy Byrd, Chairman of Walt Disney International, former Turner Broadcasting CEO Phil Kent,
[00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:46.024]  21st Century Fox COO James Murdoch and Drew Guff, a founding partner of private equity investment firm Sigler Guff.
[00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:49.705]  Another email from a staffer to Jane Hartley, the U.S.
[00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:57.408]  Ambassador to France, shows how the government intends to exploit the celebrity of actors to push its foreign policy objectives.
[00:02:57.788 --> 00:03:04.554]  We have already started to think through ways your superstars could potentially help amplify some of the great work U.S.
[00:03:04.654 --> 00:03:08.737]  Embassy Paris is doing, the staffer wrote, reports Motherboard.
[00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:22.190]  We'd love to include Sony names and events here, either as guests or performers, and would love the opportunity to leverage their popularity to promote the President's priorities and agenda overseas.
[00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.991]  The Director of Press Advance at the White House has joined the LA Times.
[00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:33.052]  The Los Angeles Times announced this morning the hiring of Johanna Mosca, an aide to President Obama.
[00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:36.993]  Mosca ironically employs the new age of newspeak
[00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:37.893]  We're good to go.
[00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:09.993]  Symbols are powerful, and the globalists have hijacked the symbols of America.
[00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:12.574]  They've turned them into their own symbols.
[00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:22.597]  Well, we are restoring the idea of the true republic, not the counterfeit globalist empire, by promoting the icon George Washington and others.
[00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:31.080]  That's why we're rolling out on 100% made-in-America line of incredible pro-liberty apparel.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.862]  We are re-popularizing liberty.
[00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:38.526]  We are helping fellow Americans rediscover what made this country great.
[00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:39.788]  We are the spirit of 1776.
