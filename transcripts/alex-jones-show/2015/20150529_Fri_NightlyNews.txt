[00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.633]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:25.957]  It is Friday night, May 29th, 2015 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.539]  Here is a little taste of what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.032]  How the Patriot Act took down its key supporter.
[00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:42.677]  Then, Rex Jones asks, what is the TPP?
[00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:47.741]  And live coverage from the Mohammed Cartoon Contest in Phoenix.
[00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:52.166]  That's next, on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:59.273]  ISIS has vowed to attack right around 6.15 when they're expected to have prayer time.
[00:01:02.588 --> 00:01:07.692]  Well, we are bringing you a very live extended version of the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:11.434]  God willing, we're going to be Skyping in live with Joe Biggs.
[00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.798]  He's in the air right now, but he should be touching down in Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:19.000]  They're having another rally for free speech there.
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.302]  And, you know, we said, Biggs, do you want to go?
[00:01:21.462 --> 00:01:23.343]  And he had already had his flight booked.
[00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.264]  So God willing, he'll get there in time.
[00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:26.826]  So we're going to be shooting this
[00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:30.710]  Addition of the news live tonight and just going as long as it takes.
[00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.472]  We're going to have a lot of reports for you.
[00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:36.816]  I'll be joined in studio by David Knight and Rob Dew here coming up.
[00:01:36.876 --> 00:01:40.801]  We're going to try to take some of your questions live on Twitter.
[00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:42.943]  I'll tell you how to do that here coming up soon.
[00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:44.865]  But let's get into the news.
[00:01:45.706 --> 00:02:00.277]  So, this weekend the Patriot Act is set to expire and a lot of people are kind of really hoping that they allow this to expire and not just have a pass it to find out what's in it type moment.
[00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:04.520]  It's set to expire midnight Sunday, so we'll keep our fingers crossed.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.904]  Obama is saying there's just a handful of senators standing in the way of the Patriot Act.
[00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:18.793]  Now, without action by midnight Sunday, a number of tools that permit law enforcement to pursue and investigate suspected terrorists will expire.
[00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:22.638]  Obama, of course, he's pulling out the terrorism card.
[00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:30.066]  He says, I don't want us to be in a situation in which for a certain period of time, those authorities go away and suddenly we are dark.
[00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:40.553]  And heaven forbid we've got a problem where we could have prevented a terrorist attack or apprehended someone who is engaged in dangerous activity.
[00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.114]  So there he goes throwing that out there.
[00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:48.319]  Heavens forbid there's some kind of a terrorist attack and there's just a handful of senators in the way.
[00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.523]  I mean, pointing out the obvious here that the Patriot Act and NSA, they have not stopped a single terrorist attack at this point.
[00:02:56.563 --> 00:03:01.825]  They were just scooping up the data of a lot of innocent Americans and people around the world.
[00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:11.730]  And possibly one of the reasons why a lot of these senators and people there are standing in the way of the Patriot Act is because of what happened to their good bunny, Dennis Hastert.
[00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.355]  Now we'll talk about him a little bit more coming up later in the news, but Dennis Hassard is the former House Speaker.
[00:03:18.835 --> 00:03:21.958]  He was the one who pushed for the Patriot Act initially.
[00:03:22.398 --> 00:03:28.243]  He took credit for the passage of the Patriot Act in 2001, as well as getting it reauthorized in 2005.
[00:03:28.663 --> 00:03:34.387]  And it is the very provisions in the Patriot Act that led to his indictment.
[00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:37.149]  So I think a lot of senators there are kind of saying,
[00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.430]  Well, wow.
[00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:46.073]  Hey, we already know that they're building a case against all of us to just kind of use whenever they want to bring the hammer down on somebody.
[00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:48.414]  But here again, not for a terrorist.
[00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:54.597]  Even if the guy is reprehensible and has done some real dirty deeds in his past, they didn't take him down for the dirty deeds.
[00:03:54.637 --> 00:04:00.219]  They took him down because he was using his cash money in a way that they did not like.
[00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:01.900]  So, more on that coming up.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.422]  But the NSA has already said that if their surveillance program ends,
[00:04:07.182 --> 00:04:10.824]  They're going to keep that treasure trove of all your phone data that they've collected.
[00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:18.089]  Now, if it expires midnight Sunday, they're already getting things prepared, moving things out of the way.
[00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:23.572]  They say they're going to isolate the computer servers where they're stored and block any investigators' access.
[00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:31.677]  But they're not going to destroy the database if it's legal authority to collect this material expires on schedule this Sunday.
[00:04:32.057 --> 00:04:46.854]  So they're just gonna hold on to it until some terror event happens and then everyone is calling for them to reinstate this program, which once again, if a terror attack does happen, the NSA will not be around to
[00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:47.815]  Stop it.
[00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:58.379]  But Obama has said, other law enforcement has said that they have some other tools in their tool bag that they can use to stop this terrorism, stop terrorist activities.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.943]  And a school in Orange County is actually going to start monitoring their students on social media using one of these tools.
[00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:09.805]  Now, this is a SnapTrends.
[00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:11.366]  They've got an annual license for this.
[00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:14.608]  SnapTrends is actually a software company based right out of here in Austin.
[00:05:15.188 --> 00:05:19.091]  But this software monitors Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.
[00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:32.740]  And the school said it plans to use this software to conduct routine monitoring for the purposes of prevention or early intervention of potential issues in which students or staff could be at risk to themselves or others.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.383]  So they're going to proactively prevent and intervene
[00:05:36.943 --> 00:05:40.405]  So they're doing all this to proactively prevent and intervene.
[00:05:40.845 --> 00:05:45.427]  Kids do stupid things, and we get it, and they do a lot of these really stupid things on social media.
[00:05:46.188 --> 00:05:50.510]  But this is getting these kids prepared to be under perpetual surveillance.
[00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.312]  And now, not just perpetual surveillance, but engaging in pre-crime.
[00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:56.033]  Okay?
[00:05:56.633 --> 00:06:03.855]  But once again, not for terrorists, it's for average Americans, young people here in school.
[00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:08.316]  Because the jihadists, check this out, they've got a help desk.
[00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:18.999]  So ISIS has created an online help desk to teach their fellow comrades safe practice and help them develop their own secure communications.
[00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:22.520]  This is a study based out of the U.S.-based Counterterrorism Center.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:33.668]  Isis is giving online training, educating their colleagues how to use established techniques for online privacy, such as the use of virtual private networks.
[00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:43.375]  They're teaching them how to use tools such as Tor, advising them against using regular popular platforms like Skype, Gmail, Google, and WhatsApp.
[00:06:44.641 --> 00:07:00.589]  And then the report says that we found conversations indicating that jihadis are in the early stages of developing secure communications and browsing programs, independent of the efforts by Western privacy advocates, and they're also working on developing their own software.
[00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:01.930]  A study found.
[00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:23.088]  So, always, right on time, ISIS is doing something that lets everyone know, well, you know what, we're going to need to keep the Patriot Act in effect and need the NSA to monitor all of our online communications because now ISIS has an online jihadi help desk to train people how to get around the government surveillance.
[00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:26.652]  Now, I'm sure everyone out there has watched The Matrix.
[00:07:26.852 --> 00:07:30.995]  If you have not, I recommend you go out and do that right away.
[00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:42.666]  But a report came out here just about a week or so ago where NASA was talking about a theory that someone had put forth that we are potentially living in this Matrix-like simulation.
[00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.907]  Where everything we are doing is sort of a pre-program.
[00:07:46.227 --> 00:07:51.769]  And I know a lot of people talk about that with just the way television shows are and the way our government works a lot of the times.
[00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:54.450]  It feels like a lot of things are programmed.
[00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:01.172]  But if you think that that is really far-fetched, this is something that the government has been working on for quite some time.
[00:08:01.552 --> 00:08:04.533]  They have been working on a simulation
[00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:06.374]  We're good to go.
[00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:45.646]  Our universe might be a Matrix-like computer game designed by aliens.
[00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:54.513]  This was a theory that was first proposed by a British philosopher Nick Bostrom just a few years after the Matrix film was released.
[00:08:54.873 --> 00:08:57.534]  So, of course he could have been influenced by the film, who knows?
[00:08:58.094 --> 00:09:05.776]  But in his paper, Dr. Bostrom suggests that a race of far-evolved descendants could be behind our digital imprisonment.
[00:09:05.997 --> 00:09:13.719]  These futuristic beings, whether they be human or otherwise, could be using virtual reality to stimulate a time in the past
[00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:17.460]  Or trying to recreate how their remote ancestors lived.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.841]  So, I know that might sound crazy, but NASA actually thinks that he could be right.
[00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:25.281]  Now, this is according to Rich Terrell.
[00:09:25.421 --> 00:09:32.603]  He is the director of the Center for Evolutionary Computation and Automated Design at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[00:09:32.983 --> 00:09:38.724]  He says that in quantum mechanics, particles do not have a definite state unless they're being observed.
[00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:45.287]  One explanation is that we're living within a simulation seeing what we need to see when we need to see it.
[00:09:45.667 --> 00:10:03.055]  And he said he still finds it inspiring that even if we are living in some sort of a simulation or many orders of magnitude down in levels of simulation, somewhere along the way something escaped the primordial ooze to become us and to result in simulations that made us.
[00:10:03.715 --> 00:10:05.456]  And so he thinks that that's cool.
[00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:10.257]  Well, I don't want to go into too deep of what that might possibly be.
[00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:16.739]  David Icke was actually on the Alex Jones Show and talked a little bit about what might be behind this digital enslavement.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:27.763]  But if you think that virtual reality and living in a simulation is just too far off, totally unreal, well that is exactly what the United States government has been working on.
[00:10:28.363 --> 00:10:33.825]  The NSA's AQUAINT program was actually featured on PBS Nova in 2009.
[00:10:34.505 --> 00:10:40.007]  AQUAINT stands for Advanced Question Answering for Intelligence.
[00:10:40.727 --> 00:10:52.711]  And PBS Nova says, With the entire Internet and thousands of databases for a brain, the device will be able to respond almost instantaneously to complex questions posed by intelligence analysts.
[00:10:53.371 --> 00:11:13.864]  As more and more data is collected through phone calls, credit card receipts, social media, GPS trackers, cell phone geolocation, internet searches, Amazon book purchases, and even E-ZPass toll records, it may one day be possible to know not just where people are and what they are doing, but what and how they think.
[00:11:14.864 --> 00:11:19.528]  So, this was many years ago, PBS Nova, you know, they're not huge conspiracy theorists.
[00:11:19.868 --> 00:11:26.473]  But think back then, 2009, smart homes and smart tracking apps weren't as prevalent as they are today.
[00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:30.596]  So, all of this technology were basically helping to build our own digital imprisonment.
[00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:39.763]  But another AI program, Sentient World Simulation, this was proposed in 2006 and has largely flown under the radar.
[00:11:40.143 --> 00:11:44.565]  Sentient World Simulation is a matrix-like reality simulating humanity.
[00:11:45.066 --> 00:11:54.370]  It is a mirror model of the real world running in parallel on a computer and it's designed to predict and evaluate future events and courses of action.
[00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:01.234]  SWS provides an environment for testing psychological operations and civil affairs activities.
[00:12:01.634 --> 00:12:05.636]  It's capable of illustrating the impact of these activities on populations.
[00:12:06.076 --> 00:12:14.821]  So in a parallel world, the Pentagon is running an AI program to see how people will react to propaganda and government-inflicted terror.
[00:12:15.241 --> 00:12:22.445]  So they can yank a country's water supply or stage a military coup and see how people are going to react.
[00:12:22.725 --> 00:12:32.894]  Now the military through all this is seeking to gain full spectrum picture of the everyday reality of people's lives and of course the adversaries of the military.
[00:12:33.294 --> 00:12:49.048]  So that's why they're tracking protesters and vegan potlucks and the Occupy protests and things like that because they're wanting to see not only who are terrorists but people who are actively trying to maybe overthrow the world order.
[00:12:49.648 --> 00:12:52.570]  So, with this upcoming Jade Helm, is this just a drill?
[00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.672]  Will soldiers be in place to test these simulation capabilities?
[00:12:58.072 --> 00:13:04.556]  Are they wargaming some potential humanitarian emergency scenarios, you know, responding to civil unrest?
[00:13:05.036 --> 00:13:07.237]  We did report last year how the U.S.
[00:13:07.257 --> 00:13:14.941]  Department of Defense put out a FedBizOp request for an even more game-changing technology to predict societal unrest.
[00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:18.603]  They were looking to find some technology that would help them to track
[00:13:19.104 --> 00:13:22.850]  All human activities that can be measured.
[00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:32.645]  David Knight and Rob Dew gave a really in-depth presentation of a whole nother level of geospatial simulation and how this is tying into Jade Helm.
[00:13:33.473 --> 00:13:41.336]  They are mapping humans onto the geological map, and they're looking at you at the individual level, every aspect of you.
[00:13:41.596 --> 00:13:43.977]  This is where the surveillance pays off for them.
[00:13:44.017 --> 00:13:47.098]  This is the geo-int, the human domain.
[00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:51.860]  And when they say mastering the human domain, it's a very specific term of art from the military.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.981]  And this has been an evolution.
[00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.722]  It started off as we're going to get real detailed maps of everything using satellite imagery.
[00:13:57.022 --> 00:13:58.383]  Well, now they have these detailed maps.
[00:13:58.583 --> 00:14:00.684]  Now they know who lives at what address.
[00:14:01.024 --> 00:14:04.846]  And now they're tying that in with your Facebook account, with your Twitter account, with your YouTube videos.
[00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:09.368]  So they're measuring your political beliefs and they can go up and down and go, well, he's kind of for us.
[00:14:09.388 --> 00:14:10.209]  This guy's against us.
[00:14:10.409 --> 00:14:11.730]  This guy's pulling the party line.
[00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:12.530]  This guy isn't.
[00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.811]  We need to put him on a watch list.
[00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:16.072]  And they're using all this for future operations.
[00:14:16.752 --> 00:14:16.932]  Let's go
[00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:44.632]  You have to understand, when they talk about the human domain, when they talk about geo-intelligence, mapping this all together, they're multi-int, taking all of this, multiple intelligence sources, focusing it down to the micro-level.
[00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:53.613]  They're very concerned, they say in these presentations, they're very concerned about one guy with a computer and a video camera because he can have worldwide impact.
[00:14:53.813 --> 00:14:56.214]  That's why they're looking at you as an individual.
[00:14:56.474 --> 00:14:56.914]  Exactly.
[00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:58.496]  And now, I want to go to this first clip.
[00:14:58.516 --> 00:14:59.236]  This is Lt.
[00:14:59.276 --> 00:14:59.557]  Col.
[00:14:59.757 --> 00:15:00.497]  Al DiLeonardo.
[00:15:00.517 --> 00:15:04.661]  This is from the Master of the Human Domain 2010 GEOINT conference.
[00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:06.782]  And he used to run a fusion cell for U.S.
[00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:07.603]  Special Forces.
[00:15:08.083 --> 00:15:10.005]  Okay, so this is not some ordinary guy.
[00:15:10.165 --> 00:15:14.288]  Hey, just like that's the bottom of the Jade Helm logo, Master of the Human Domain.
[00:15:14.448 --> 00:15:19.692]  The cell's objectives were to use as much non-traditional data
[00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:24.755]  From an Intel standpoint, that means a lot of open source data.
[00:15:25.095 --> 00:15:38.601]  To go out and do sense making of data, so that not only your analysts, but your machine learning, your algorithms you could build, would ultimately get to a predictive analysis cell.
[00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:42.763]  It's very, very hard to do, especially if you don't have all the data.
[00:15:42.923 --> 00:15:48.226]  Basically, old data is good data, new data is good data, and all data is good.
[00:15:49.426 --> 00:16:07.500]  In the context of how I view human brain, somewhat controversial in some aspects, it's sociocultural information and it becomes, when used in intelligence purposes or for sense making for operations,
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:16.745]  When you bring it to the GEOINT, and I don't mean to be coy in saying that, when you bring GEOINT to it, I think it becomes human terrain.
[00:16:16.945 --> 00:16:25.511]  You have to reach out and have people using traditional, non-traditional data sets as you see there further to the right.
[00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:30.313]  And ultimately as you bring in ESRI products and GEOINT, you get outputs.
[00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:36.660]  As unclassified examples there of different layers that you would make.
[00:16:37.261 --> 00:16:48.053]  It's that open source combined with the classified information, combined with the now, the old and the now that begins to give you the layers you can make to make sense of what's really going on.
[00:17:04.151 --> 00:17:05.405]  Okay.
[00:17:08.823 --> 00:17:10.384]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:17:10.804 --> 00:17:16.866]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:25.730]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world and install a corporate fascist state.
[00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.111]  I had read their own books, discovered their own documents.
[00:17:28.471 --> 00:17:36.394]  And my focus went from running six miles every other day, swimming two, three miles a couple times a week, and lifting weights,
[00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:39.037]  We're focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:17:39.377 --> 00:17:44.865]  I transformed my body from the beautiful gift that God gave me into something more akin to Jabba the Hutt.
[00:17:45.146 --> 00:17:46.147]  It became an internet joke.
[00:17:46.628 --> 00:17:51.094]  But now I've started the transformation back, getting my body, my temple, in shape.
[00:17:51.314 --> 00:17:52.837]  And I'm about to tell you how I did it.
[00:17:53.297 --> 00:18:01.302]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:18:01.683 --> 00:18:06.246]  Super Mel Vitality, Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and Oxy Powder.
[00:18:06.526 --> 00:18:13.531]  Those three products of the entire family of Infowarslife.com products are the most important from my own personal experience.
[00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:19.815]  The problem was though I'd never been a vitamin and mineral and supplement taker before so I kept forgetting to do it.
[00:18:20.295 --> 00:18:22.096]  So after I'd lost over 60 pounds
[00:18:23.597 --> 00:18:31.323]  Just a month and a half ago, I asked the crew to take a photo of me in the same lighting to see what I could do in just a month and a half.
[00:18:31.603 --> 00:18:34.005]  This is what happened in just 45 days.
[00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:38.749]  We took this photo back there in the back office, and I'd already lost a lot of weight.
[00:18:39.329 --> 00:18:44.392]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina, my energy levels exploded.
[00:18:44.632 --> 00:18:45.733]  Now is the time to take action.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.863]  Start your journey today with the Alex Challenge Pack.
[00:19:00.063 --> 00:19:01.705]  It's the trifecta of change.

[00:19:19.062 --> 00:19:20.203]  Jakari Jackson here.
[00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.884]  We have a new report on our site.
[00:19:22.365 --> 00:19:24.786]  Student punished for bringing hot pepper to school.
[00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:27.949]  This is a young man out of Long Island, a 10th grader.
[00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:33.333]  Basically his family likes to eat spicy food and you know, his buddies thought they did too.
[00:19:33.353 --> 00:19:34.654]  A stressed thought.
[00:19:34.974 --> 00:19:40.138]  So he took a hot pepper to school, which is supposed to be, you know, one of the hottest that you can get, hottest you can buy.
[00:19:40.818 --> 00:19:43.560]  And his buddies, they partook and they got sick.
[00:19:43.601 --> 00:19:46.803]  They went to the nurse's office and then the young man was disciplined.
[00:19:47.203 --> 00:19:51.328]  I believe the option he was facing was a day of suspension or two days of detention.
[00:19:52.309 --> 00:20:00.018]  And yes, I do believe this is overkill just in general, but then they went a step further and compared the hot peppers to this.
[00:20:01.155 --> 00:20:03.836]  Ghost pepper ads say they'll knock your socks off.
[00:20:04.216 --> 00:20:08.939]  The fad has spread to ghost pepper fast food fries, chili, and burgers.
[00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:10.459]  I eat hot food.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.320]  My family eats hot food.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.941]  It's just in all blood.
[00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:18.383]  The leans were mystified when they say the school likened the peppers to acid.
[00:20:18.743 --> 00:20:21.125]  I was told that it's equivalent to giving someone LSD.
[00:20:22.392 --> 00:20:23.273]  So there you have it.
[00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:29.518]  They said that bringing in a hot pepper was like bringing in LSD, which I most definitely disagree with.
[00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.260]  But you know, this is no surprise.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.902]  We see these things all the time in Chicago.
[00:20:33.922 --> 00:20:47.795]  They're not even allowing parents to pack the lunches anymore saying that, you know, the school lunch program knows best, even though you can find many examples of the kids being very unhappy with that program that Mrs. Obama is the figurehead for.
[00:20:48.275 --> 00:20:55.338]  You know, kids getting suspended for eating their pop tarts the wrong way and paper guns and playing with guns in their own front yard.
[00:20:55.378 --> 00:20:56.958]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:20:57.358 --> 00:21:04.661]  And then earlier this week we were talking about how the kids couldn't even, you know, play in their own front yards with forts and tree houses.
[00:21:04.701 --> 00:21:07.322]  But you know, that's a different matter outside the school.
[00:21:07.822 --> 00:21:12.204]  So this is the type of craziness we have to deal with when you go to the public school system.
[00:21:12.284 --> 00:21:15.505]  I don't have any kids, but it makes me very fearful for when I do,
[00:21:15.965 --> 00:21:17.445]  That they have to deal with this type of crap.
[00:21:17.925 --> 00:21:21.146]  So you can find more reports on the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:29.207]  The knowledge of the ancients.
[00:21:29.527 --> 00:21:30.788]  Tried and true.
[00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:33.108]  Trusted herbs and extracts.
[00:21:33.328 --> 00:21:35.948]  Fused with the latest nutraceutical science.
[00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:39.709]  Introducing the all new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:44.570]  Crafted with over 14 key ancient herbs and extracts to supercharge
[00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.270]  We're good to go.
[00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.771]  We're good to go.
[00:22:30.751 --> 00:22:41.054]  We are here to announce the unsealing of charges and the arrests of individuals as part of our long-running investigation into bribery and corruption in the world of organized soccer.
[00:22:41.234 --> 00:22:46.156]  It must have been, let's pretend we work for the American People Day over at the Department of Justice.
[00:22:46.636 --> 00:23:02.371]  Newly appointed United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch dropped the hammer on World Cup soccer executives, issuing warrants for their arrest regarding the accumulation of over $150 million received by employing methods of racketeering, money laundering, and wire fraud.
[00:23:02.651 --> 00:23:08.533]  The head of the snake of this notorious soccer empire, Sepp Blatter, will of course remain untouched.
[00:23:08.853 --> 00:23:22.957]  Bread and Circus historically serves as a huge distraction while the real criminals mingle in smoke-filled rooms holding the puppet strings of law enforcement that knows full well how they arrived at their position and where the real line is drawn.
[00:23:23.217 --> 00:23:24.057]  And so it goes.
[00:23:24.157 --> 00:23:35.981]  While the world watches soccer executives scurrying out like rats, no arrests, no warrants, nothing is done to the instigators of a far greater recent scandal that dealt punishing blows to the economy.
[00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:41.523]  Six banks have agreed to pay a combined $5.8 billion to the Justice Department and other regulators.
[00:23:41.903 --> 00:23:44.424]  Five of them have pled guilty to criminal charges.
[00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:55.430]  Citicorp, JP Morgan, Barclays and RPS are pleading guilty to charges tied to forex manipulation, while UBS is pleading guilty to interest rate manipulation charges.
[00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.332]  They have each agreed to a three-year corporate probation period.
[00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:06.536]  No scurrying executives, no impending jail time, just a laughable corporate probation period and fines.
[00:24:06.897 --> 00:24:12.840]  Who cares if executives of the most powerful banks colluded on rigging interest rates to make billions of dollars?
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:28.668]  The DOJ doesn't seem to mind that the Department of Defense spent $4 million on taxpayer-funded credit cards for personal charges, including $3.2 million of it at casinos and $100,000 at strip clubs by 646 government cardholders.
[00:24:29.109 --> 00:24:36.993]  While the average American family is seeing their health care costs skyrocket, the government throws away billions per year on waste and fraud.
[00:24:37.426 --> 00:24:47.890]  Those very same officials spending our taxpayer dollars will be right on board once the cash trough is replaced by digital currency, and that is coming sooner than most people think.
[00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:56.733]  A new age of economic totalitarianism, as highlighted by economist Martin Armstrong, is being discussed with zeal in secret meetings in London.
[00:24:57.253 --> 00:25:04.094]  Armstrong writes, this idea of eliminating cash first floated as the normal trial balloon to see how the people would take it.
[00:25:04.275 --> 00:25:10.936]  Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University and William Buter, the chief economist at Citigroup, first launched the concept.
[00:25:11.156 --> 00:25:17.937]  Their claims have been widely hailed and their papers are now the foundation for the new age of economic totalitarianism that confronts us.
[00:25:18.197 --> 00:25:25.539]  Rogoff and Buter have laid the groundwork for the end of much of our freedom and one day will be considered the new Marx with hindsight.
[00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:33.904]  Considerations of their arguments have shown how governments can seize all economic power and destroy cash in the process of eliminating all rights.
[00:25:34.264 --> 00:25:37.947]  Physical paper money provides the check against negative interest rates.
[00:25:38.107 --> 00:25:42.109]  For if they become too great, people will simply withdraw their funds and hoard cash.
[00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.831]  Furthermore, paper currency allows for bank runs.
[00:25:45.091 --> 00:25:51.856]  Eliminate paper currency and what you end up with is the elimination of the ability to demand to withdraw funds from a bank.
[00:25:52.136 --> 00:25:55.478]  Our Defense Department squanders billions of taxpayer dollars.
[00:25:55.578 --> 00:26:00.621]  We wanted to know how much taxpayer money the government spends on these mysterious micro-purchases.
[00:26:01.302 --> 00:26:02.182]  So we found out.
[00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:07.306]  Our review found about 20 billion dollars in just about the course of a year.
[00:26:07.686 --> 00:26:11.448]  We asked all of these other major federal agencies based here in D.C.
[00:26:11.488 --> 00:26:15.591]  for their micro-purchase shopping lists and all refused.
[00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:23.436]  The same cadre of criminals that crashed the economy in 2008 were merely slapped on the old wrist after being caught rigging interest rates.
[00:26:23.736 --> 00:26:40.406]  And world governments are colluding to imprison the population with a digital currency that will enslave anyone that doesn't adhere to the impending New World Order system run by a group of elite scum that would become far more powerful than anything we have ever imagined in our worst nightmares.
[00:26:40.726 --> 00:26:47.909]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, as it is called, is an all-out assault on our national sovereignty.
[00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.692]  It would unconstitutionally transfer legislative powers from the U.S.
[00:26:52.752 --> 00:27:04.177]  Congress, our state legislatures, our city and county governments, to multinational corporations and unaccountable international bureaucrats at the World Trade Organization.
[00:27:04.737 --> 00:27:11.299]  Americans are still off in la-la land thinking that the United States has the sovereignty.
[00:27:11.879 --> 00:27:18.021]  You know, the International Organization of Securities Commission regulates our market.
[00:27:18.721 --> 00:27:26.504]  And there's a Basel Commission on Banking and BIS, Bank International Settlements.
[00:27:27.024 --> 00:27:30.305]  The Federal Reserve is part of BIS.
[00:27:30.945 --> 00:27:32.327]  It regulates banking.
[00:27:32.347 --> 00:27:40.254]  You know, the International Criminal Court of Europe has jurisdiction over here in the United States.
[00:27:40.635 --> 00:27:48.142]  So the American people need to wake up that the sovereignty of the United States is gone.
[00:27:48.482 --> 00:27:50.624]  Global government's not coming, it's here.
[00:27:51.485 --> 00:27:52.226]  Exactly.
[00:27:52.677 --> 00:28:01.231]  But twisting a few media moguls arms to squeeze out bribes within an industry built on kicking a ball around a field is far more important.
[00:28:01.692 --> 00:28:03.515]  John Bowne, InfoWars.com
[00:28:10.836 --> 00:28:12.077]  Another major health threat.
[00:28:12.097 --> 00:28:16.982]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:28:17.002 --> 00:28:19.704]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:28:19.744 --> 00:28:26.530]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.633]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:28:29.793 --> 00:28:31.074]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:28:31.094 --> 00:28:33.415]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:28:33.475 --> 00:28:35.997]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[00:29:00.013 --> 00:29:07.517]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today to purchase your ProPure Pro1 G2.0 water filtration system or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:29:18.161 --> 00:29:25.388]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[00:29:26.129 --> 00:29:34.176]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:38.100]  How many did I adopt?
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.121]  I kill my kids!
[00:29:39.641 --> 00:29:40.843]  I kill my kids!
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.983]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[00:29:51.763 --> 00:29:52.604]  That's pretty cool, man.
[00:29:53.744 --> 00:29:56.846]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:59.607]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[00:30:00.618 --> 00:30:01.359]  I don't think so.
[00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:03.841]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[00:30:03.901 --> 00:30:04.902]  I pay for them.
[00:30:04.942 --> 00:30:06.223]  How many do you pay for them?
[00:30:06.303 --> 00:30:06.843]  Upwards of 50.
[00:30:06.903 --> 00:30:07.083]  Really?
[00:30:07.203 --> 00:30:07.564]  Oh yeah.
[00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:23.882]  You, you piece of f***ing s***!
[00:30:23.902 --> 00:30:25.724]  Bunch of misogynist mother f***er!
[00:30:25.764 --> 00:30:27.105]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[00:30:27.565 --> 00:30:28.285]  Tyler, you're being aggressive.
[00:30:28.966 --> 00:30:29.707]  I'm being aggressive!
[00:30:30.047 --> 00:30:30.467]  Come on!
[00:30:30.507 --> 00:30:31.488]  Come on!
[00:30:31.508 --> 00:30:32.769]  Let's get this on!
[00:30:32.809 --> 00:30:33.549]  Watch out!
[00:30:33.569 --> 00:30:34.050]  Watch out!
[00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:38.153]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[00:30:46.519 --> 00:30:51.583]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:10.172]  What do you think the TPP is?
[00:31:10.893 --> 00:31:11.753]  T-T-P?
[00:31:12.074 --> 00:31:13.595]  No, what is T-T-P?
[00:31:13.795 --> 00:31:14.396]  The D-P-P?
[00:31:14.816 --> 00:31:15.236]  The what?
[00:31:15.557 --> 00:31:16.377]  T-P-P.
[00:31:17.318 --> 00:31:17.919]  I have no idea.
[00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:18.879]  Nope.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.241]  I have no idea what that is.
[00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:21.442]  I ain't got a clue.
[00:31:21.782 --> 00:31:22.442]  I have no idea.
[00:31:22.803 --> 00:31:25.305]  Do any of y'all know what the heck the TPP is?
[00:31:25.325 --> 00:31:26.426]  TPP?
[00:31:26.486 --> 00:31:26.966]  No.
[00:31:27.387 --> 00:31:28.588]  Uh, no.
[00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:32.831]  Nobody knows what this is!
[00:31:32.851 --> 00:31:34.212]  I have no idea.
[00:31:34.232 --> 00:31:37.055]  It's, uh, toilet paper products.
[00:31:37.984 --> 00:31:42.146]  The Texas Petroleum people?
[00:31:42.666 --> 00:31:43.487]  The terrorist group?
[00:31:43.507 --> 00:31:44.107]  I don't know.
[00:31:44.627 --> 00:31:49.230]  My name is the WWE Thunderstruck Rollercoaster.
[00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:50.510]  God bless you.
[00:31:52.731 --> 00:31:53.512]  Words of wisdom.
[00:31:53.832 --> 00:31:55.313]  I would honestly have no idea.
[00:31:55.933 --> 00:31:59.455]  Well, it gives information.
[00:32:02.596 --> 00:32:06.617]  Well, I don't know exactly the words in English.
[00:32:07.257 --> 00:32:08.637]  And that's what we call guessing.
[00:32:08.897 --> 00:32:12.558]  Probably some Congress thing about homeless men.
[00:32:13.618 --> 00:32:14.779]  Tyrannical people in power.
[00:32:15.999 --> 00:32:18.060]  Actually pretty close, actually pretty darn close.
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.040]  Toilet paper.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.721]  The TPP, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:23.321]  Trans, trans what?
[00:32:23.877 --> 00:32:42.541]  Pacific Partnership is an alliance of corporate global businesses that will then be able to, in any of the three segments, Asian, Pacific, European, or American, will be able to bypass any or all of the laws and rules in that place and be able to do it with currency and due process.
[00:32:42.581 --> 00:32:43.382]  What do you think about that?
[00:32:44.242 --> 00:32:48.163]  Reminds me of what China does with their free market zones.
[00:32:49.203 --> 00:32:53.264]  I would definitely have to hear a lot more information because this sounds a lot like
[00:32:53.954 --> 00:32:56.156]  A bit of conspiracy theory to me.
[00:32:56.176 --> 00:32:58.678]  I think it sounds a little bit far-fetched.
[00:32:59.638 --> 00:33:04.862]  I'm being totally honest, I just don't... care right now.
[00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:05.543]  Is that bad?
[00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.004]  Like, I was just so unprepared for this.
[00:33:08.265 --> 00:33:09.225]  I think that's awesome, dude.
[00:33:10.106 --> 00:33:11.367]  Actually, yeah, I think it's awesome.
[00:33:12.408 --> 00:33:12.608]  Why?
[00:33:12.628 --> 00:33:17.591]  I mean, because we need people like that, I guess.
[00:33:18.412 --> 00:33:19.893]  I literally have no clue.
[00:33:20.133 --> 00:33:22.335]  I've never... I haven't watched the news in a while, man.
[00:33:23.743 --> 00:33:25.244]  Okay, well, there you have it.
[00:33:26.104 --> 00:33:26.945]  He hasn't watched news.
[00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:28.866]  None of us have.
[00:33:29.787 --> 00:33:34.790]  We just vote for Obama, and pray that he doesn't smite us with his mighty hand of vengeance.
[00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.513]  My first question for you is, which party do you support?
[00:33:40.133 --> 00:33:41.294]  Third party, Libertarian.
[00:33:41.634 --> 00:33:44.015]  Okay, okay, okay.
[00:33:44.395 --> 00:33:45.036]  Okay, good.
[00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:51.300]  I wanted to make sure I didn't end up on some, like, anti-Obama or something, because it is Texas.
[00:34:02.219 --> 00:34:05.002]  Yes, because that would be devastating.
[00:34:05.022 --> 00:34:09.706]  The TPP is fine, just don't insult the Lord and Savior Barack Obama.
[00:34:10.227 --> 00:34:17.334]  Now joining me now in studio is David Knight, and you are watching a very live edition of this InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:34:17.894 --> 00:34:21.258]  We have just received word the Biggs has landed.
[00:34:21.278 --> 00:34:26.262]  It's going to take him about 30 minutes to get to the site, then we're going to be Skyping in with him live.
[00:34:26.923 --> 00:34:27.843]  If everything goes well.
[00:34:28.624 --> 00:34:32.245]  I wanted to let you know that you can tweet us your questions on Twitter.
[00:34:32.285 --> 00:34:34.586]  Tweet them directly to our Twitter handles.
[00:34:35.126 --> 00:34:36.827]  I am Leanne McAdoo.
[00:34:37.767 --> 00:34:39.928]  Dew just created a Twitter today.
[00:34:40.348 --> 00:34:41.108]  You can follow him.
[00:34:41.168 --> 00:34:44.049]  That's DewsNews with a Z at the end.
[00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:45.610]  And David Knight
[00:34:46.576 --> 00:34:47.636]  Liberty Terian.
[00:34:47.897 --> 00:34:49.457]  That's Liberty Terian.
[00:34:49.737 --> 00:34:50.337]  Not Liberty Heron.
[00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:50.798]  Liberty.
[00:34:51.598 --> 00:34:52.258]  Liberty Terian.
[00:34:52.298 --> 00:34:55.659]  And so we'll have the guys pull those up so you can see for yourselves.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:01.822]  Now, earlier I mentioned that Dennis Hastert, he was the former House Speaker.
[00:35:02.682 --> 00:35:07.026]  He took responsibility, you know, took credit for helping to pass the Patriot Act in 2001.
[00:35:07.886 --> 00:35:28.444]  He was so happy about that, helped get it reauthorized again in 2005, and now it is that very Patriot Act and the provisions that were in there that were used to indict him on charges related to paying three and a half million dollars in hush money, which the federal law enforcement was able to detect that using the Patriot Act.
[00:35:28.564 --> 00:35:44.158]  It's kind of interesting that this guy kind of came out of nowhere and he was in place when September 11th came along when they needed somebody to push the Patriot Act through and you know one of the things that we're going to see in this and of course Alex Jones talked with Wayne Madsen a great deal about this today.
[00:35:44.198 --> 00:35:48.462]  We're going to have a clip about that towards the end of the after this segment.
[00:35:49.568 --> 00:35:56.654]  But they were talking about why is it that we have so many corrupt politicians and leadership of both parties?
[00:35:57.254 --> 00:36:02.819]  And of course the answer is they need people who are compromised that they can use as puppets.
[00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:08.443]  And so then the other question becomes why did they wait until now to come after Dennis Hastert?
[00:36:08.543 --> 00:36:13.187]  Why he was in there longest time a Republican has ever been Speaker of the House for eight years.
[00:36:13.928 --> 00:36:15.069]  Now they're coming after him.
[00:36:15.909 --> 00:36:19.030]  Very interesting, the timing that this is coming up with.
[00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:20.611]  But I've got some other questions here too.
[00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:23.672]  Let's take a look at what they're really coming after him for.
[00:36:23.732 --> 00:36:39.619]  Because, you know, we ought to also ask the question, how did a guy go from being a basketball, I'm sorry, a wrestling coach in a high school, how did he go from that to becoming a multi-millionaire who could pay millions of dollars to a blackmailer?
[00:36:39.799 --> 00:36:40.940]  Because that's what happened here.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:46.763]  We should look at the obscene concentration of power and money in Washington and what this tells us.
[00:36:46.783 --> 00:36:50.866]  Of course we see it with the Clintons, we see it with the Bushes, we see it with Obama himself.
[00:36:50.906 --> 00:36:55.828]  This is a guy who had never done anything in his life except be a community organizer.
[00:36:55.889 --> 00:37:01.252]  He was selected by the elites and put into place just like Dennis Hastert.
[00:37:01.972 --> 00:37:15.635]  And so the question about this becomes, and we'll talk about what the charges are, but it's really, you know, he got this cash, they're saying legally, but now he is facing a very long time in prison for cash that he picked up legally.
[00:37:15.895 --> 00:37:18.416]  But let's first talk about some of these charges that have come up.
[00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:24.138]  There was an interesting fine, I think it was the Hill that found this last year on C-SPAN.
[00:37:26.258 --> 00:37:32.282]  Dennis Hastert was on talking about his speakership, and it was open lines, and they had this creepy call.
[00:37:32.302 --> 00:37:33.503]  This was put out by Drudge.
[00:37:33.583 --> 00:37:34.723]  Let's go to that clip right here.
[00:37:38.105 --> 00:37:39.466]  Okay, you don't have that clip just yet.
[00:37:39.726 --> 00:37:47.871]  Okay, we're going to go back to that clip, but basically he was a high school coach, as I mentioned, wrestling coach, before he became a politician.
[00:37:48.192 --> 00:37:48.872]  Okay, got that clip.
[00:37:48.892 --> 00:37:50.773]  Let's run that clip.
[00:37:50.793 --> 00:37:52.414]  Here's Bruce, Independent Light.
[00:37:52.434 --> 00:37:52.574]  Hi.
[00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:53.935]  Hello, Danny.
[00:37:54.295 --> 00:37:55.216]  Hey, how are you doing?
[00:37:55.762 --> 00:37:56.302]  Pretty good.
[00:37:58.223 --> 00:37:59.643]  Remember me from Yorkville?
[00:38:00.103 --> 00:38:00.683]  Bruce, you're on.
[00:38:00.703 --> 00:38:01.844]  Go ahead with your question.
[00:38:02.564 --> 00:38:07.005]  I think he's gone.
[00:38:07.025 --> 00:38:09.185]  So this guy just called in to troll him there.
[00:38:09.205 --> 00:38:11.946]  He just called up, yeah, you remember me from Yorkville?
[00:38:11.966 --> 00:38:13.987]  Because that's the name of the high school, the town, the high school.
[00:38:14.747 --> 00:38:19.828]  Evidently, he was paying this guy, had agreed to pay this individual $3 million, Leanne.
[00:38:20.508 --> 00:38:22.369]  And after he paid out about $1.7 million, he stopped.
[00:38:23.709 --> 00:38:27.030]  So maybe this guy was kind of firing a shot across the bow at that point.
[00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.091]  Now we know that there are multiple charges.
[00:38:30.131 --> 00:38:35.512]  This was leaked out today by people with the Justice Department, the FBI, the ones investigating this.
[00:38:35.872 --> 00:38:45.495]  They called up the LA Times and they were telling them this is allegations of sexual misconduct with children that he had in high school, underage people that he had in high school.
[00:38:46.135 --> 00:38:52.744]  And so it's interesting that they're pulling this out and they're shopping this around because that's not what they're going to send him to jail for.
[00:38:52.764 --> 00:38:53.205]  Right.
[00:38:53.465 --> 00:38:56.930]  The statute of limitations has long since gone away.
[00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.715]  That was 35 years or more because he became a politician in about 1980, 81.
[00:39:02.998 --> 00:39:07.942]  So these charges would be 35 years old, there's a statute of limitations, so he's not going to go to jail for that.
[00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:16.348]  But they're creating this whisper campaign right now to discredit him and to keep people from asking why is he going to be going to jail.
[00:39:16.428 --> 00:39:21.292]  Because the reason he's going to be going to jail, that's what we want to talk about, is this structuring charge.
[00:39:21.672 --> 00:39:29.559]  This is something that he helped to create as part of the Patriot Act and he's going to be hoisted by his own batard right into jail because it looks like
[00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:35.145]  They could get as much as 530 years against him.
[00:39:35.305 --> 00:39:37.908]  They're saying they're going to take each of these structuring charges.
[00:39:38.228 --> 00:39:44.454]  What he did to pay this blackmailer off, first he took out 15 withdrawals of $50,000.
[00:39:44.754 --> 00:39:46.956]  And again, it's his money, okay?
[00:39:46.996 --> 00:39:50.039]  But that was reported to the FBI as being something that was suspicious.
[00:39:50.519 --> 00:39:51.760]  So they began an investigation.
[00:39:52.461 --> 00:39:54.963]  They talked to him and he said, well, I just don't trust the banks.
[00:39:55.304 --> 00:39:56.385]  That's I'm keeping the money.
[00:39:56.445 --> 00:40:02.110]  I'm just, you know, it basically wasn't really any of their business why he was taking this money out.
[00:40:02.971 --> 00:40:06.033]  At that point, though, he decided he was going to do it secretly.
[00:40:06.414 --> 00:40:13.540]  So then he started taking out withdrawals at less than $10,000 so that it wouldn't get noticed, except that he'd already been noticed.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.723]  So they started monitoring his account.
[00:40:16.963 --> 00:40:17.664]  He did that 106 times.
[00:40:19.105 --> 00:40:24.573]  For each of those, they say that they're going to charge him up to a maximum of 5 years for each of those accounts.
[00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:26.475]  So that would be 530 years.
[00:40:26.756 --> 00:40:28.258]  Now, consider this, Leanne.
[00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:34.807]  If he had been convicted of sexually molesting a minor in Illinois, he would have gotten between 6 to 30 years.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.180]  530 years for structuring.
[00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:46.483]  If he had robbed a bank, because this is his money that he's withdrawing, if he'd gone in and robbed a bank, he would have gotten 6 to 55 years.
[00:40:46.803 --> 00:40:50.244]  The upper limit would be if it was armed robbery and he hurt people.
[00:40:50.964 --> 00:40:56.166]  But for taking out his own cash and not filing the paperwork with the government,
[00:40:56.886 --> 00:41:02.530]  This law that he helped to pass could possibly send him to jail for 530 years.
[00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:09.816]  And so we have to really ask when we're looking at this, they're going to try to get you focused on his sexual perversion.
[00:41:09.896 --> 00:41:10.156]  Right.
[00:41:10.336 --> 00:41:17.722]  And that's the Department of Justice made the decision to not even include that in the indictment, to specify his past conduct.
[00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:19.483]  He had previous bad acts.
[00:41:19.683 --> 00:41:20.264]  Right.
[00:41:20.344 --> 00:41:22.085]  But they went around and spent the day
[00:41:23.106 --> 00:41:31.690]  Putting that in the media's ear that, in quotes, Hastert paid a man to conceal sexual misconduct while the man was a student at the high school where Hastert taught.
[00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.911]  So they're wanting everyone to just say, oh, throw him in jail.
[00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:35.772]  He's a pervert.
[00:41:35.832 --> 00:41:36.812]  What an awful person.
[00:41:37.372 --> 00:41:41.774]  Where, like you're saying, it's actually what's happening with his own money.
[00:41:41.974 --> 00:41:45.096]  Where if you were to, if he was to have
[00:41:45.876 --> 00:41:46.376]  Yes, exactly.
[00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:47.257]  Exactly.
[00:42:02.128 --> 00:42:02.529]  Absolutely.
[00:42:02.969 --> 00:42:08.696]  And I think it's outrageous that the statute of limitations has run out on the sexual molestation of minors.
[00:42:08.736 --> 00:42:09.838]  I don't think there ought to be one.
[00:42:09.898 --> 00:42:11.980]  But nevertheless, that's what the law is.
[00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:16.666]  But we see that these laws, these structuring laws, they began a long time ago.
[00:42:17.347 --> 00:42:26.193]  And they basically have created an entire industry around this and we're going to talk about what an assistant attorney general said to the anti-money laundering conference.
[00:42:26.213 --> 00:42:34.819]  There's an entire industry within the banks and basically you need to understand that although you may think that Dennis Hastert deserves this and he does.
[00:42:34.899 --> 00:42:37.541]  He deserves to go to jail for what he's done.
[00:42:37.601 --> 00:42:44.486]  He doesn't deserve to go to jail for taking his own cash out of the bank and you need to understand that if you support that
[00:42:45.166 --> 00:42:47.307]  You're in line to have that done to you as well.
[00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:54.772]  We've got a couple of cases just to make it just so that you understand and see how this works out for individuals.
[00:42:55.646 --> 00:43:01.830]  Of course we've had people who get their cash stolen from them constantly when they're stopped on the road by the highway patrol.
[00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.511]  We just had a recent case of a guy who was traveling cross-country.
[00:43:04.812 --> 00:43:05.692]  He had cash on him.
[00:43:05.732 --> 00:43:11.756]  He was going to California to start a new business and the TSA on the trains confiscated that cash.
[00:43:12.076 --> 00:43:13.777]  So that is civil asset forfeiture.
[00:43:14.257 --> 00:43:17.879]  Now that is bad enough, but then it gets even worse with structuring.
[00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:19.901]  Because what's bad about civil asset forfeiture, they say,
[00:43:20.521 --> 00:43:23.364]  It's civil, so we don't have to give you due process.
[00:43:23.404 --> 00:43:24.786]  We don't have to charge you with a crime.
[00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:27.348]  We don't have to convict you in court, in a trial.
[00:43:27.849 --> 00:43:40.823]  We can just merely say that your property was involved in committing this crime, and we charge your property with criminal action, this inanimate object, and seize that property, or they call it forfeit that property, is the way that they put it.
[00:43:41.323 --> 00:44:00.528]  So, we see that this has affected people in a variety of ways, but we've seen in North Carolina, just within the last week and a half, two cases come to light of one attorney from the Department of Justice that's based in North Carolina going after two small businesses and taking all of the money out of their accounts.
[00:44:00.648 --> 00:44:02.288]  In one case, it was a convenience store.
[00:44:02.308 --> 00:44:05.589]  They took $107,000 out of this man's convenience store.
[00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:07.630]  In the other case, it was a business.
[00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.910]  They'd been in business for 30 years.
[00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:14.853]  And because of money that they were withdrawing, they said that it was structured.
[00:44:15.073 --> 00:44:16.794]  Very subjective, the way they do this.
[00:44:17.214 --> 00:44:18.375]  They said it was structured.
[00:44:18.395 --> 00:44:20.696]  They confiscated all of their property.
[00:44:20.996 --> 00:44:22.097]  This is the way it's been reported.
[00:44:22.117 --> 00:44:27.060]  Now, the first guy, the convenience store owner, Lyndon McClellan, had a bank account for his convenience store.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.581]  It was seized by the IRS.
[00:44:28.961 --> 00:44:30.782]  And at first, he didn't understand why.
[00:44:30.862 --> 00:44:35.464]  The IRS said that it suspected that he was violating federal structuring laws.
[00:44:35.484 --> 00:44:36.025]  Do you understand that?
[00:44:36.645 --> 00:44:37.566]  It suspected.
[00:44:38.326 --> 00:44:39.747]  He wasn't even charged with the crime.
[00:44:39.847 --> 00:44:40.147]  That's right.
[00:44:40.307 --> 00:44:41.148]  They had no evidence.
[00:44:41.168 --> 00:44:44.210]  They just suspected that he was structuring deposits.
[00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:53.276]  Now, if you get a convenience store and you're collecting cash, when you deposit the cash, that may not be any criminal intent whatsoever.
[00:44:53.897 --> 00:45:03.103]  And they merely look at the amount of money that you put in or the amount of money that you take out, and they subjectively determine that you were trying to avoid going over that $10,000 limit.
[00:45:05.004 --> 00:45:10.827]  And of course, if you've got a business, if you're anyone who's ever had a business, you understand if you're dealing in cash, that's not a lot of money.
[00:45:11.247 --> 00:45:12.968]  That is a lot of money for us as individuals.
[00:45:13.248 --> 00:45:16.069]  It's not a lot of money for a business to do that.
[00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:19.050]  Now, this is what the attorney, the federal attorney, U.S.
[00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.291]  Attorney Steve West said to McClellan.
[00:45:21.791 --> 00:45:23.212]  He said, don't go public.
[00:45:23.712 --> 00:45:25.553]  He said, this will only make things worse for you.
[00:45:25.613 --> 00:45:29.235]  He said, it just ratchets up feelings within the agency.
[00:45:30.185 --> 00:45:30.545]  Get that?
[00:45:30.585 --> 00:45:33.168]  In other words, don't make us mad at you.
[00:45:33.668 --> 00:45:35.610]  Don't go public because we'll get mad at you.
[00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:36.671]  So he says, here's the deal.
[00:45:37.232 --> 00:45:41.195]  I'll return 50% of the money and this will stop this right now.
[00:45:41.936 --> 00:45:43.437]  And he said, no, I'm not going to do that.
[00:45:43.738 --> 00:45:46.941]  He went public and the public was outraged about that.
[00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:48.391]  We're good to go.
[00:46:07.012 --> 00:46:13.614]  They said they were looking, they had a bank account for their three decade old business, 30 years old, Marla Enterprises.
[00:46:14.034 --> 00:46:16.615]  They were amazed to find that the bank account was empty.
[00:46:16.695 --> 00:46:22.036]  The bank called them and wanted to know how they were going to cover $18,000 in outstanding checks that they had written.
[00:46:22.056 --> 00:46:28.478]  So you have to understand the cash flow involved in a business, the amount of money is much larger than you're going to see as an individual.
[00:46:28.518 --> 00:46:29.339]  That's why $115,000 is not that much.
[00:46:29.379 --> 00:46:30.339]  They just wrote $18,000 worth of checks.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:40.786]  Now, in this case, it wasn't the IRS, it was the Secret Service that seized the money, but it was done by the same U.S.
[00:46:40.826 --> 00:46:41.106]  attorney.
[00:46:41.147 --> 00:46:43.649]  He said, we got no warning, nothing at all.
[00:46:44.169 --> 00:46:46.492]  And so this guy did the same thing to them.
[00:46:46.852 --> 00:46:49.735]  Again, he said, I'll give you back half of it.
[00:46:49.755 --> 00:46:53.018]  And they said, no, we don't owe anything.
[00:46:53.158 --> 00:46:53.999]  We didn't commit a crime.
[00:46:54.019 --> 00:46:54.680]  We didn't do anything.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.400]  He said, OK, OK.
[00:46:56.201 --> 00:46:57.922]  I'll give you all of it back except for $10,000."
[00:46:58.422 --> 00:47:01.043]  And I said, absolutely not.
[00:47:01.463 --> 00:47:02.923]  This is what he had to say.
[00:47:02.963 --> 00:47:04.444]  This is what the business owner had to say.
[00:47:04.504 --> 00:47:08.265]  He said, my wife and I have run a business our entire lives.
[00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:10.566]  It's hard-earned, legitimate money.
[00:47:10.686 --> 00:47:13.967]  Why should I give it up and let it be stolen from us, whether it's $1 or $100?
[00:47:16.728 --> 00:47:17.609]  Exactly right.
[00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.271]  He committed no crime.
[00:47:19.532 --> 00:47:25.418]  This is a criminal government and this is the kind of government that Dennis Hastert created.
[00:47:25.438 --> 00:47:25.799]  Right.
[00:47:25.819 --> 00:47:28.482]  That is still with us, that is still abusing everybody.
[00:47:28.822 --> 00:47:35.911]  And then get this, even though they have had some minor reforms of this, they had the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act that was just recently passed.
[00:47:36.451 --> 00:47:47.422]  Under that, these people who have had charges made against them by their banks, they've had legal fees that they've had to go through to try to get their money back, that was stolen from them by the U.S.
[00:47:47.462 --> 00:47:52.266]  government, these people are entitled to get back $25,000 in legal fees.
[00:47:52.867 --> 00:47:54.549]  The government just said, we're not going to do that.
[00:47:55.489 --> 00:47:56.649]  I mean, this is the law.
[00:47:57.069 --> 00:48:07.311]  This is a law that was passed, Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, that was passed to stop these very kind of abuses from attorneys that work for the U.S.
[00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:12.352]  government, like Stephen West in North Carolina, and he just simply says, no, we're not going to obey that law.
[00:48:12.572 --> 00:48:20.514]  They pick which laws they want to obey, which ones they don't, they violate the Constitution with all of them, and they're stealing people's money right out of their accounts.
[00:48:20.534 --> 00:48:25.055]  And who they want to come after and prosecute, because obviously the banks are too big to jail.
[00:48:25.475 --> 00:48:25.735]  Yes.
[00:48:25.755 --> 00:48:29.237]  They won't come after them when they're... Well, and let's understand, exactly.
[00:48:29.358 --> 00:48:30.578]  That's exactly the point.
[00:48:30.939 --> 00:48:33.460]  Look at the largest money laundering case ever.
[00:48:34.281 --> 00:48:34.901]  HSBC.
[00:48:35.762 --> 00:48:38.583]  They were fined 1.9 billion dollars.
[00:48:38.964 --> 00:48:43.386]  Again, that sounds like a lot of money, but not for HSBC.
[00:48:43.727 --> 00:48:45.648]  Do you understand how much that fine is?
[00:48:46.048 --> 00:48:46.909]  And let me make it clear.
[00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:50.810]  HSBC really was engaged in criminal activity.
[00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.391]  They've come to us and they've said, we need to have this surveillance of your accounts.
[00:48:54.751 --> 00:49:02.094]  We need to have this massive system of reporting from the banks spying on you and sending reports to us all the time.
[00:49:02.134 --> 00:49:09.576]  We need to have that because you might be doing something, moving cash around to launder money for drug cartels or for terrorist groups.
[00:49:10.196 --> 00:49:14.898]  HSBC was laundering money for drug cartels, for terrorist groups.
[00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:15.918]  There's no question about it.
[00:49:16.218 --> 00:49:17.358]  They got caught red-handed.
[00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:22.861]  They're the kind of person, the kind of entity that this law was written for, trying to stop this.
[00:49:23.221 --> 00:49:34.525]  Not for people who are hard-working small businessmen who just happen to be depositing money without any regard, not trying to break the law, not understanding even what the law is, and yet the government takes their entire account.
[00:49:34.946 --> 00:49:37.527]  They took 1.9 billion dollars from HSBC.
[00:49:37.567 --> 00:49:41.548]  That was less than one month's profit for that company.
[00:49:41.808 --> 00:49:42.789]  Less than one month's profit.
[00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:44.669]  If you look at that on an annual basis, that's 8%.
[00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:58.115]  That, if you look at that as a tax for them doing business illegally with drug cartels and money launderers, okay, that 8% tax if you want to call that, the money laundering tax, that's less than their income tax.
[00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:03.697]  Of course, they don't pay any income tax anyway, but it's less than a corporation would pay, less than an individual would pay.
[00:50:04.017 --> 00:50:06.458]  None of you out there paying 8% income tax.
[00:50:07.198 --> 00:50:13.281]  And so they get away with an 8% tax even though they were guilty as could be with this.
[00:50:13.854 --> 00:50:18.899]  Right, and that's the other thing is just not pointing out that the real crime should be here with Hastert.
[00:50:18.979 --> 00:50:28.707]  He entered in Congress with a net worth of no more than $270,000 and then exited Congress with somewhere between $4 million and $17 million.
[00:50:29.128 --> 00:50:29.948]  Same thing with the Clintons.
[00:50:29.968 --> 00:50:30.569]  That's a crime.
[00:50:30.849 --> 00:50:31.210]  Exactly.
[00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:33.612]  Same thing with the Clintons, same thing with the Obamas, okay.
[00:50:34.132 --> 00:50:37.795]  Of course, Hillary says when she got out of Congress they were flat broke.
[00:50:37.936 --> 00:50:38.216]  Oh yeah.
[00:50:39.195 --> 00:50:41.818]  That's why they had to up their speaking fees.
[00:50:41.858 --> 00:50:43.620]  Yeah, that's the real problem.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.462]  And I don't think you can stop it.
[00:50:45.502 --> 00:50:47.764]  See, campaign finance reform isn't going to get there.
[00:50:48.826 --> 00:50:51.448]  This is something that these guys are getting after they get elected.
[00:50:51.509 --> 00:50:54.752]  The problem is not campaign finance reform, unfortunately.
[00:50:55.072 --> 00:50:58.076]  The problem is that there's so much power in Washington.
[00:50:58.456 --> 00:51:01.116]  That it is a black hole for criminals.
[00:51:01.717 --> 00:51:01.977]  Okay?
[00:51:02.037 --> 00:51:07.378]  It's a black hole for these type of people, like Dennis Hastert, who they know doesn't have much sense.
[00:51:07.418 --> 00:51:15.919]  I mean, this is a guy that the FBI has come to him and asked him why he took out $750,000 and $50,000 increments.
[00:51:16.539 --> 00:51:17.559]  And he lies about it.
[00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:20.620]  And then he starts trying to structure his deposits.
[00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.960]  He should know better because he passed the law.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:23.320]  Exactly.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:23.620]  Okay?
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.461]  If he doesn't know what's in the law, maybe he didn't read it after he passed it.
[00:51:30.562 --> 00:51:33.583]  Of all people, he should know what's in it, so he's not a very bright bulb.
[00:51:34.243 --> 00:51:38.344]  But he's somebody who's crooked, he's corrupt, somebody that they can control.
[00:51:39.145 --> 00:51:46.407]  And he's obviously been a sociopath and a predator from his early days as a coach.
[00:51:47.567 --> 00:51:50.228]  There's a lot we can learn from this, but I hope people will understand
[00:51:51.272 --> 00:51:58.315]  The legal corruption, the fallacies underlying civil asset forfeiture and structuring as a crime.
[00:51:58.335 --> 00:52:02.297]  Now Rand Paul and other individuals have co-sponsored this.
[00:52:02.337 --> 00:52:03.938]  I can't remember the co-sponsor in the house.
[00:52:04.278 --> 00:52:06.920]  They have sponsored now twice what they call the FAIR Act.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:15.724]  The FAIR Act would stop civil asset forfeiture and it would stop the crime, quote unquote, of structuring.
[00:52:16.244 --> 00:52:20.747]  If it's not being used to hide something that is illegal activity like HSBC.
[00:52:21.187 --> 00:52:23.008]  So hopefully that will go through.
[00:52:23.108 --> 00:52:24.489]  People need to understand what this is.
[00:52:24.709 --> 00:52:26.631]  And let me give you something from Woody Guthrie.
[00:52:26.911 --> 00:52:30.453]  This is the guy who, you know, wrote This Land is Your Land, This Land is Mine.
[00:52:30.773 --> 00:52:34.155]  He said, As through this world I've wandered, I've seen lots of funny men.
[00:52:34.776 --> 00:52:37.617]  Some will rob you with a six-gun, some with a fountain pen.
[00:52:38.418 --> 00:52:38.718]  Okay?
[00:52:39.018 --> 00:52:40.939]  Dennis Hastert is that kind of man.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.662]  This attorney, Stephen West, this U.S.
[00:52:44.722 --> 00:52:50.846]  attorney who is robbing small businesses throughout central North Carolina is that kind of man.
[00:52:51.066 --> 00:52:55.209]  He is nothing but a thief with a fountain pen and he's not obeying the law.
[00:52:55.469 --> 00:52:58.831]  He won't even obey the reform of this unconstitutional act.
[00:52:59.735 --> 00:53:12.964]  Well, and all I can say is hopefully that with this happening right there in Congress as they're trying to figure out if they're going to reauthorize the Patriot Act or not, everyone there can sort of see that they're not above the law or that they might, you know... Hey guys, this is Rob Dew.
[00:53:13.044 --> 00:53:16.046]  I just wanted to give you all a quick update on what's going on.
[00:53:16.066 --> 00:53:17.627]  We just got contact from Joe Biggs.
[00:53:17.668 --> 00:53:22.131]  He's acquired his rental car and is on his way to the site.
[00:53:22.791 --> 00:53:38.923]  So I would say 30-35 minutes he'll be there depending on traffic what it's like we're about two hours ahead here in Texas so it's about eight o'clock now so it's what six o'clock there and so just to give everybody an update out
[00:53:39.443 --> 00:53:46.789]  Who's watching us online on the YouTube stream and on the InfoWars.com forward slash show stream and on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:48.650]  All the streams out there.
[00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:49.751]  We appreciate everybody watching.
[00:53:50.392 --> 00:53:51.252]  Joe Biggs is on his way.
[00:53:51.293 --> 00:53:56.276]  We're going to, as soon as he gets there, we'll, you know, get a rundown from him of what he sees, what's going on.
[00:53:57.137 --> 00:54:02.260]  And I do believe he's going to be open-carrying his head-down Prevectus rifle.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:05.642]  Hopefully not in action.
[00:54:05.682 --> 00:54:08.964]  Second Amendment there, so just give you that quick update.
[00:54:09.004 --> 00:54:14.087]  David, great breakdown there on the real hidden truth of this Dennis Hastert thing.
[00:54:14.187 --> 00:54:16.569]  It's got a lot of angles to it, but I think you've really nailed it.
[00:54:16.929 --> 00:54:24.335]  Well, Rob, I hope that with this, you know, they're still talking about the Patriot Act, as Leanne mentioned, and I hope that people will keep this in mind.
[00:54:24.755 --> 00:54:26.096]  People don't understand what's going on.
[00:54:26.116 --> 00:54:27.998]  We just saw that with the report from Rex Jones.
[00:54:28.038 --> 00:54:29.939]  They don't know what the TPP is.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.062]  If you asked any of these people what structuring is, they wouldn't know.
[00:54:33.222 --> 00:54:34.423]  Businesses don't know.
[00:54:34.883 --> 00:54:39.607]  They don't understand how the government is robbing us, and that's really a big part of the problem.
[00:54:39.887 --> 00:54:42.269]  Well, and they think they're above the problem that they're creating.
[00:54:42.289 --> 00:54:43.650]  Yes, they think it's not going to happen to them.
[00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:45.711]  But look, you don't have to have a business.
[00:54:45.731 --> 00:54:50.695]  People are getting their cash stolen from them as they're traveling in cars, traveling on trains across this country.
[00:54:51.675 --> 00:54:55.838]  Whatever you're carrying, whatever the amount is, it's a big amount to you.
[00:54:56.298 --> 00:54:58.340]  And actually, people who don't have a lot of money
[00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:05.703]  Are really in a worse position than someone who does, who has a business that they can use for collateral because they can hire lawyers to get this back.
[00:55:05.743 --> 00:55:14.166]  You don't get a public defender to help you recover your cash when they seize it with civil asset forfeiture because they say it's not a criminal act.
[00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:15.967]  So you don't get a public defender even.
[00:55:16.007 --> 00:55:26.151]  So if it's a small amount of money and you're poor, even if you want to do this on the point of principle, you're not going to be able to do it because you're not going to have the money to challenge these people in court.
[00:55:27.478 --> 00:55:33.521]  And also, too, there with the veiled threats that the police are issuing to people that they're confiscating their money.
[00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:40.484]  You were mentioning that they were kind of also sending out those same threats to the bankers themselves.
[00:55:40.624 --> 00:55:41.025]  Absolutely.
[00:55:41.485 --> 00:55:43.746]  They are going after individuals.
[00:55:43.886 --> 00:55:46.507]  They're going after small businesses.
[00:55:46.867 --> 00:55:53.951]  They let the big criminals, the big banks like HSBC, who are actually doing criminal money laundering, they let them go with very small penalty.
[00:55:54.491 --> 00:55:58.375]  But they're threatening the small banks, just like everything else.
[00:55:58.395 --> 00:55:59.676]  The small banks are going to come after them.
[00:55:59.936 --> 00:56:08.144]  And so there was this conference of anti-money laundering individuals, Anti-Money Laundering and Financial Crime Conference.
[00:56:08.584 --> 00:56:10.566]  And this was back in March.
[00:56:10.726 --> 00:56:15.070]  And this was the Assistant Attorney General Caldwell, who went and addressed them.
[00:56:15.111 --> 00:56:19.294]  And what he did was he used this occasion to threaten the small banks.
[00:56:19.935 --> 00:56:29.742]  And he says that we're, he also talks about a process where they're going after kleptocracy asset recovery initiative, CARI.
[00:56:29.922 --> 00:56:33.844]  I guess it's kind of like cash and carry, you know, where they go after a foreign government.
[00:56:34.165 --> 00:56:38.147]  They say, well, we determined that this foreign government we think is corrupt.
[00:56:38.607 --> 00:56:40.249]  So we're going to call it a kleptocracy.
[00:56:40.569 --> 00:56:44.832]  And we're going to say that wherever we can get to any of their assets, we're going to just steal them.
[00:56:45.723 --> 00:56:46.023]  Okay.
[00:56:46.283 --> 00:56:48.344]  Now, of course, they're not going to give it back to the people.
[00:56:48.644 --> 00:56:49.264]  They're going to keep it.
[00:56:49.284 --> 00:56:49.704]  The U.S.
[00:56:49.724 --> 00:56:50.645]  government is going to keep it.
[00:56:50.685 --> 00:56:54.826]  They're going to keep it just like law enforcement keeps the stuff that they steal.
[00:56:55.206 --> 00:56:56.827]  But that's the whole point.
[00:56:56.867 --> 00:57:02.028]  The irony of this is that our government is the biggest kleptocracy on the planet.
[00:57:02.428 --> 00:57:04.949]  It is a rule by thieves.
[00:57:04.989 --> 00:57:06.710]  That's what these people are doing throughout this.
[00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:09.511]  But I want to read to you what he said to these bankers.
[00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:15.816]  When the criminal division, that's what he represents, and these are the people that will be trying Dennis Hastert.
[00:57:15.836 --> 00:57:23.182]  He said, when the criminal division evaluates a company's compliance policy during investigation, we don't only look at how the policy reads on paper.
[00:57:23.642 --> 00:57:30.047]  We also look at messages that are conveyed to employees, including in-person meetings, emails, telephone calls, compensation.
[00:57:30.067 --> 00:57:34.291]  In other words, this is a full-on East German surveillance state.
[00:57:34.671 --> 00:57:41.234]  Okay, where they're going to look at everything about your business, they're going to complete surveillance of everything.
[00:57:41.254 --> 00:57:47.257]  It's not going to be like the privileged people like Hillary Clinton who say they've got a private email server and you can't see that.
[00:57:47.317 --> 00:57:49.718]  No, they're going to come in and look at everything in these banks.
[00:57:49.958 --> 00:57:51.279]  They say we look at it as a whole.
[00:57:51.639 --> 00:57:54.440]  A company that's meaningfully stressed compliance, have they?
[00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:59.343]  Or if they're facing a conflict between compliance and profits, does the company choose profits?
[00:58:00.023 --> 00:58:06.407]  In the anti-money laundering and sanctions context in particular, effective compliance requires more.
[00:58:06.487 --> 00:58:07.748]  And I'd like to highlight a few points.
[00:58:07.808 --> 00:58:09.929]  First, you need to know your customer.
[00:58:09.969 --> 00:58:12.971]  In other words, spy incessantly on your customer.
[00:58:13.351 --> 00:58:16.213]  Constantly report everything about your customer.
[00:58:16.733 --> 00:58:21.299]  And he says, it's not enough just to be filing these reports.
[00:58:21.339 --> 00:58:22.701]  We want you to do more.
[00:58:23.021 --> 00:58:26.926]  More reports, and we want you to contact law enforcement completely.
[00:58:26.946 --> 00:58:29.209]  They say part of this is information sharing.
[00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:30.010]  Okay?
[00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:33.555]  And he says the second thing is, if this is a foreign bank and they have a U.S.
[00:58:33.615 --> 00:58:33.995]  branch,
[00:58:34.736 --> 00:58:42.078]  Then this foreign bank that happens to have a branch somewhere in the United States, they need to spy on all of their customers in that other country.
[00:58:42.098 --> 00:58:48.180]  So if they've got an Irish bank, they want them to spy on all the Irish customers.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.460]  I know this is an international show.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.181]  We've got a lot of people who watch us from around the world.
[00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:52.701]  Here's the point, folks.
[00:58:53.641 --> 00:59:00.703]  If you don't live in the United States, make sure you don't do business with a bank that has a branch in the United States.
[00:59:00.783 --> 00:59:02.084]  Because if you do,
[00:59:02.944 --> 00:59:24.041]  The federal government wants that Irish bank, even if you never set foot in the US, they want that Irish bank to report everything about you, anything that is suspicious, and then if some federal agency wants to assume that you did something suspicious, they will confiscate your cash even though you never set foot in the United States.
[00:59:24.341 --> 00:59:26.122]  That's the kind of kleptocracy we have.
[00:59:26.162 --> 00:59:27.303]  You want a real kleptocracy?
[00:59:27.323 --> 00:59:29.125]  It's right here in Washington.
[00:59:29.845 --> 00:59:41.033]  And he says, the majority of financial institutions file suspicious activity reports, but we encourage those institutions to consider whether to take more action, specifically alert law enforcement authorities about the problem.
[00:59:41.374 --> 00:59:46.818]  They may be able to seize funds or initiate an investigation or take other proactive steps.
[00:59:47.198 --> 00:59:53.783]  And he goes on to say, you know, you might think this is going to cost you a lot of money to hire all these anti-money laundering personnel.
[00:59:54.363 --> 01:00:00.956]  But he said, it may not be a profit center, but an investment will pay off because if you don't do it...
[01:00:01.883 --> 01:00:05.284]  We will come after you, is essentially what he's saying to them.
[01:00:05.585 --> 01:00:09.046]  Wow, so you're investing and not being investigated.
[01:00:09.286 --> 01:00:10.446]  It's a protection racket.
[01:00:11.387 --> 01:00:13.448]  These people are nothing but gangsters.
[01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:16.649]  Look at the way this US attorney, Stephen West, comes to these people.
[01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:23.192]  He steals their money, he has no reason to steal their money, and then he says, I'll tell you what, I'll give you back half of it.
[01:00:23.432 --> 01:00:24.592]  Don't get us ratcheted up.
[01:00:24.812 --> 01:00:28.774]  Yeah, don't talk to the press, don't tell anybody about this, I'll give you half of it back.
[01:00:29.494 --> 01:00:30.134]  You stole this from me.
[01:00:30.154 --> 01:00:31.195]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:00:31.435 --> 01:00:33.616]  And I'm glad these two businesses went out with this.
[01:00:34.056 --> 01:00:37.238]  I suspect we just saw these two things pop up all at once.
[01:00:37.278 --> 01:00:39.119]  We saw the second one pop up in North Carolina.
[01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:43.821]  I suspect the only reason we saw the second one pop up is because of the publicity that the first one got.
[01:00:44.161 --> 01:00:48.283]  And I think that now the local news in North Carolina is looking for this.
[01:00:48.743 --> 01:00:51.685]  If we make this go national, I bet this is going to be popping up everywhere.
[01:00:51.725 --> 01:00:53.026]  This is standard operating procedure.
[01:00:53.406 --> 01:00:59.950]  As bad as this is with this particular attorney, Stephen West, this is not something that is just coming out of that one North Carolina office.
[01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:03.372]  This is national and it is international, as I just pointed out.
[01:01:03.433 --> 01:01:09.096]  They will steal your money if you live in another country, never set foot in the United States, if your bank, not even a U.S.
[01:01:09.156 --> 01:01:14.880]  bank that you're dealing with, but if your foreign bank has a branch in the United States, they can use that to steal your money.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.261]  Wow, that's unbelievable.
[01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:19.043]  I didn't know about that aspect of the deal at all.
[01:01:19.683 --> 01:01:29.150]  And it's important, like you have mentioned, what they really want everyone to focus on is the sexual indiscretions of this man's past.
[01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:35.054]  And of course, you know, he's the embodiment of everything that's sleazy there in Washington with that.
[01:01:35.094 --> 01:01:37.295]  But that's not what they came after him for.
[01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:39.757]  And the issue there is the over-criminalization.
[01:01:40.057 --> 01:01:40.498]  Exactly.
[01:01:40.778 --> 01:01:42.780]  We saw that with Waco, if you remember.
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.223]  When they went into Waco, of course, this is something that was already staged.
[01:01:46.884 --> 01:01:51.128]  They had the press, they called the press to come and watch what they were going to do.
[01:01:51.468 --> 01:01:55.773]  The key word to kick it off was Showtime, when they attacked the Branch Davidians.
[01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.434]  But when all of this went south,
[01:01:58.194 --> 01:01:59.714]  And everything blew up in their face.
[01:02:00.535 --> 01:02:06.337]  What they did was, they didn't talk about any federal firearms issues that they were coming after him for.
[01:02:06.537 --> 01:02:06.817]  Okay?
[01:02:06.857 --> 01:02:07.877]  This was the ATF.
[01:02:08.397 --> 01:02:09.477]  They were only coming after him.
[01:02:09.498 --> 01:02:13.839]  They only had the jurisdiction to come after him for some kind of a firearms problem.
[01:02:14.179 --> 01:02:15.839]  They didn't talk about that whatsoever.
[01:02:15.859 --> 01:02:19.241]  And of course, it was nothing, again, except some paperwork charges.
[01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:19.661]  Okay?
[01:02:19.861 --> 01:02:20.641]  That he had not paid.
[01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:25.783]  What they did was, they smeared him with allegations of child abuse.
[01:02:25.963 --> 01:02:27.043]  Child sex abuse.
[01:02:27.659 --> 01:02:29.320]  And when I looked at that, I was like, give me a break.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.301]  That's not why this happened.
[01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:33.983]  You know, it was hard to get information back in that day.
[01:02:34.043 --> 01:02:35.284]  We didn't have internet.
[01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:40.327]  We had to rely on just billboards that were passing things around.
[01:02:40.347 --> 01:02:41.648]  So it was difficult to get information.
[01:02:41.668 --> 01:02:44.410]  But when you saw that, you knew there was something wrong.
[01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:48.073]  When the government was vilifying these people saying, this is all about child abuse.
[01:02:48.133 --> 01:02:52.195]  It's like, if it was about child abuse, the ATF wouldn't have been there with an armed raid.
[01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:53.937]  They wouldn't have called the press to come in there.
[01:02:54.277 --> 01:02:56.018]  It was simply a beard.
[01:02:56.058 --> 01:02:57.239]  And so now they're doing that again.
[01:02:57.719 --> 01:03:00.961]  They don't want you to focus on structuring.
[01:03:01.001 --> 01:03:07.365]  They don't want you to wake up and understand what's going on with civil asset forfeiture before it happens to you or your family.
[01:03:07.805 --> 01:03:08.826]  But you need to wake up.
[01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:11.768]  You need to understand what's going on because it will happen to you.
[01:03:11.908 --> 01:03:14.509]  It will happen to people that you know if we don't stop this.
[01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:16.971]  This is a criminal kleptocracy.
[01:03:17.631 --> 01:03:18.092]  Thieves.
[01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:22.056]  And of course these thieves were put into place by people like Dennis Astridge.
[01:03:22.076 --> 01:03:23.298]  So he deserves what he gets.
[01:03:23.358 --> 01:03:28.985]  But we don't deserve to be abused by his perversion of the legal system.
[01:03:29.025 --> 01:03:29.766]  And that's the key thing.
[01:03:29.997 --> 01:03:32.598]  Yeah, I mean that's just, you nailed it right there with that.
[01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:36.519]  I was, it makes me want to leave this country but where would we go?
[01:03:36.539 --> 01:03:39.819]  I mean it seems as though it's... Yeah, they'll steal your money no matter what country you're in.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:40.840]  Exactly.
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:51.923]  Well now, on the Alex Jones Show today we had Wayne Madsen come on and he was actually the investigative journalist who broke this Hastert blackmail sex scandal story in 2006.
[01:03:53.703 --> 01:03:54.303]  Nine years ago.
[01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:56.224]  Yeah, he was the first one to come out about it.
[01:03:56.244 --> 01:03:59.466]  Of course, you know, conspiracy theorists and all of that.
[01:04:00.106 --> 01:04:06.889]  But here, you know, years later... That's what they call anybody who's an investigative journalist, you're called a conspiracy theorist.
[01:04:07.369 --> 01:04:13.972]  If your investigation uncovers criminal or embarrassing information about people in power, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:04:13.992 --> 01:04:15.113]  That's their pushback.
[01:04:15.464 --> 01:04:23.768]  Right and that's kind of what you're supposed to do as an investigator is you're supposed to look at what's underneath the service and what's not you know what they're not just telling you right there.
[01:04:23.908 --> 01:04:27.370]  If you follow it wherever it leads that's that's what they'll do to protect themselves.
[01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:32.232]  Well let's take a look at this report from Wade Madsen on the Alex Jones Show today.
[01:04:44.853 --> 01:04:56.027]  Okay, on September 30th, 2006, I first reported on my website about this past misconduct of Dennis Hastert.
[01:04:56.788 --> 01:05:02.456]  Remember, he was Speaker of the House, third in line under presidential succession to the presidency.
[01:05:03.036 --> 01:05:10.961]  If I can just read this because it's very interesting this background of Hastert and how he got to his position.
[01:05:12.122 --> 01:05:32.516]  What I reported on September 30th, 2006, nine years ago, congressional sources told me that Hastert, while working from 1964 to 1980 as a popular history government teacher and wrestling coach at Yorkville High School in Yorkville, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, was the subject of persistent rumors about inappropriate contact
[01:05:32.916 --> 01:05:35.259]  With male members of his high school wrestling team.
[01:05:35.659 --> 01:05:41.885]  The culture of the times usually resulted in such alleged behavior being covered up by public and parochial school authorities.
[01:05:41.925 --> 01:05:50.754]  However, the rumors were enough for his Yorkville constituency to reject him when he ran for an open seat in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1980.
[01:05:51.835 --> 01:06:00.164]  However, Hastert lucked out when another sitting Republican House member who represented the three-seat district had a stroke and declined to run for re-election.
[01:06:00.204 --> 01:06:04.588]  The GOP machine bosses selected Hastert as the replacement candidate.
[01:06:04.869 --> 01:06:06.651]  Hastert served in Springfield from 1980 to 1986.
[01:06:08.192 --> 01:06:14.638]  Six years to make the transformation from wrestling coach, with that clout surrounding himself, to politician.
[01:06:14.758 --> 01:06:18.381]  In 1986, Hastert received another unexpected promotion.
[01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:21.004]  After incumbent Republican U.S.
[01:06:21.084 --> 01:06:30.792]  Representative John Grotberg was nominated by the GOP for a second term, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and fell into a coma.
[01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:32.254]  The Illinois Republican
[01:06:33.134 --> 01:06:44.582]  That's how Hastert got into the House of Representatives.
[01:06:45.582 --> 01:06:51.986]  He was rejected because of the rumors surrounding him as a high school wrestling coach.
[01:06:52.186 --> 01:06:59.011]  I heard from people in that particular town, Yorkville, and nearby, that Hastert was caught
[01:07:01.272 --> 01:07:07.757]  With inappropriate sexual contact with underage male members of his high school wrestling team.
[01:07:09.118 --> 01:07:18.244]  And isn't it funny, he only got into these political positions because either somebody had a stroke or somebody died of cancer.
[01:07:18.705 --> 01:07:28.472]  I remember walking with a friend of mine and we encountered Charlie Rangel back in those days in the Rotunda.
[01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:36.358]  You know, if you're with somebody and they kind of look at something and it's like an inside, they have some inside information.
[01:07:36.638 --> 01:07:43.823]  Well, here comes Hastert walking across the rotunda with a young, very young male page.
[01:07:43.963 --> 01:07:48.867]  Obviously, you see members of Congress with their senior staffers, chief of staff all the time.
[01:07:49.367 --> 01:07:50.648]  But this was very unusual.
[01:07:50.688 --> 01:07:55.792]  And I noticed a wry smile on Congressman Rangel's face, like he knew something.
[01:07:56.853 --> 01:08:01.457]  And, you know, the neuro-linguistics on that one said everything.
[01:08:02.038 --> 01:08:10.485]  And I actually had the opportunity of running into Hastert after he was speaker at the GOP convention in 2000 in Tampa.
[01:08:10.505 --> 01:08:17.211]  There was kind of a people traffic jam in the arena.
[01:08:17.831 --> 01:08:17.991]  Yeah.
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:41.724]  I forgot your name and I told him and the guy turned pale and said I got to get back to my Illinois delegation.
[01:08:42.124 --> 01:08:47.066]  So clearly he recalled the reports that I had on his misconduct back in 06.
[01:08:47.947 --> 01:08:49.628]  Oh you're definitely on target.
[01:09:07.165 --> 01:09:10.567]  I want to talk about a perfect storm today.
[01:09:11.748 --> 01:09:16.110]  And the perfect storm I'm going to discuss is a really good perfect storm.
[01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:30.418]  I have prayed, literally, to be able to find a high quality gun sponsor that is affordable and that is extremely well made and effective that I can promote to my audience.
[01:09:30.938 --> 01:09:34.740]  About six months ago, we get contacted by Head Down Firearms.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.441]  HDfirearms.com.
[01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.361]  Low cost compared to competitors.
[01:09:39.062 --> 01:09:40.022]  Super high quality.
[01:09:40.402 --> 01:09:41.182]  Super lightweight.
[01:09:41.602 --> 01:09:42.382]  Super accurate.
[01:09:42.602 --> 01:09:45.183]  And the experts salivate over it and love it.
[01:09:45.503 --> 01:09:46.804]  It is a perfect storm.
[01:09:47.784 --> 01:09:50.404]  It is a true diamond that we found.
[01:09:50.925 --> 01:09:51.705]  It's amazing.
[01:09:51.785 --> 01:09:56.126]  And so I feel so good about fully endorsing Head Down Firearms.
[01:09:56.626 --> 01:09:57.986]  HDfirearms.com.
[01:09:58.366 --> 01:10:00.047]  Check them out today and then go look at
[01:10:00.547 --> 01:10:02.889]  The dozens and dozens of third-party reviews.
[01:10:03.269 --> 01:10:08.793]  Go and watch the videos of folks stacking this up against rifles that cost $1,000 more.
[01:10:09.294 --> 01:10:21.222]  Their entire line of 5.56, 3.08, and their accessories are simply amazing, and it's designed by battle-hardened vets that know what they wish they would have had.
[01:10:21.763 --> 01:10:28.408]  Right after InfoWars got two of the head-down rifles in, we went out to my buddy Shane Steiner's ranch and had a fantastic time.
[01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:36.371]  Now, what I have to say so far, based off looking at this, this is a much lighter weight M4 AR-15, whatever you want to call it.
[01:10:36.731 --> 01:10:38.151]  This is a great weapon.
[01:10:38.191 --> 01:10:41.893]  I mean, I like how the railing system is for your hands, how you can get in.
[01:10:41.913 --> 01:10:42.833]  It's very comfortable.
[01:10:43.133 --> 01:10:48.795]  If I want to go in here and do some close quarters and come around, this is an amazing, amazing gun.
[01:10:49.136 --> 01:10:51.436]  I wish I had something like this when I was in combat.
[01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:58.059]  I mean, I'm telling you right now, an M4 like this would save a lot of lives if the military would just pick this up and put it
[01:10:58.599 --> 01:11:02.442]  Army-wide, Marine-wide, Navy, this is a good gun.
[01:11:02.642 --> 01:11:07.085]  This is something that's stable, reliable, lightweight, and very easy to use.
[01:11:07.285 --> 01:11:11.587]  Well, this here is another model of the Provectus line, and it's a little more heavy-duty.
[01:11:11.848 --> 01:11:13.108]  It's really well put together.
[01:11:13.849 --> 01:11:14.509]  Nothing rattles.
[01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:17.731]  It's got this enlarged charging handle.
[01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:19.712]  It's ambidextrous.
[01:11:20.273 --> 01:11:21.173]  I've been playing with the trigger.
[01:11:21.814 --> 01:11:23.475]  It's about a three and a half, four pound
[01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:26.003]  It's got a real crisp break to it.
[01:11:26.564 --> 01:11:35.416]  And again, I have some custom rifles at home that I've spent large amounts of money trying to get a trigger that has that type feel.
[01:11:53.130 --> 01:12:02.467]  Joe Biggs here at the office had the idea of getting a mannequin, wrapping an ISIS flag around it, and sticking a clown wig on top of it with some Tannerite and blowing it up.
[01:12:02.907 --> 01:12:05.332]  And the results were somewhat spectacular.
[01:12:23.448 --> 01:12:31.795]  In my view, guns are an incredible financial investment as well, but they're also an investment in the future liberty of this country.
[01:12:32.195 --> 01:12:37.979]  I'm proud of the fact that the United States is the most armed country in the world, and I want to make sure we keep it that way.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.802]  We're not gelded, castrated slaves.
[01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:42.223]  We don't live in North Korea.
[01:12:42.463 --> 01:12:43.804]  We don't live in communist China.
[01:12:44.024 --> 01:12:45.685]  We don't live in Fidel Castro's Cuba.
[01:12:46.066 --> 01:12:51.350]  We live in the United States of America that has been exceptional, that has been amazing,
[01:12:51.710 --> 01:12:55.832]  And then we've been losing ground to the globalists, and now the tide is starting to turn.
[01:12:56.073 --> 01:12:58.794]  The spirit of 1776 is rising.
[01:12:59.034 --> 01:13:04.978]  And I'm telling you, the spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms.
[01:13:05.498 --> 01:13:07.239]  HDFirearms.com.
[01:13:07.379 --> 01:13:10.181]  Or you can visit HeadDownProducts.com.
[01:13:10.321 --> 01:13:11.922]  That's HeadDownProducts.com.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:24.881]  Welcome back!
[01:13:25.021 --> 01:13:27.843]  You are watching us live on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:13:27.923 --> 01:13:30.085]  It's about 817 p.m.
[01:13:30.165 --> 01:13:31.666]  here in Austin, Texas.
[01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:33.847]  We can go to a live shot now.
[01:13:33.887 --> 01:13:36.929]  I think we've got some aerial footage coming in from Fox News.
[01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:42.093]  They're out there at Phoenix and Joe Biggs has landed.
[01:13:42.113 --> 01:13:44.695]  I'm not sure, has he arrived there yet guys?
[01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:47.797]  Or do we have an ETA on Joe Biggs?
[01:13:49.710 --> 01:13:50.451]  He's still en route.
[01:13:50.971 --> 01:13:51.291]  Okay.
[01:13:51.551 --> 01:13:58.917]  Well, you can see there's a pretty large crowd gathering there now, and I guess the prayer time would have started just a couple of minutes ago, so.
[01:14:00.398 --> 01:14:02.920]  Joining me now in studio, Rob Dew.
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:03.060]  Mm-hmm.
[01:14:04.461 --> 01:14:08.705]  And I would just like to point out that you started your Twitter account today.
[01:14:08.725 --> 01:14:11.427]  I mean, like- I finally fell into the pit.
[01:14:11.527 --> 01:14:17.692]  In epic troll fashion, you started a Twitter account specifically to troll someone.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:25.677]  I just sent one tweet out about this and it was in response to an article that one Matt Visor wrote.
[01:14:26.824 --> 01:14:31.768]  One reporter searched for talk show host Alex Jones, and it was very interesting.
[01:14:31.848 --> 01:14:32.729]  I got this email.
[01:14:32.749 --> 01:14:35.911]  If you guys scroll down to the bottom, you see my first tweet was about five or six hours ago.
[01:14:35.931 --> 01:14:36.452]  A follower tweet.
[01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.493]  Yeah.
[01:14:39.094 --> 01:14:40.935]  So I saw this guy's email.
[01:14:41.075 --> 01:14:41.716]  I contacted him.
[01:14:41.776 --> 01:14:43.857]  I said, hey, you know, let's see if we can work something out.
[01:14:44.178 --> 01:14:45.499]  Alex does not have a lot of time.
[01:14:45.679 --> 01:14:46.639]  When does he get here in the morning?
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:50.362]  He gets here about 20 minutes before the show, and he's looking at news.
[01:14:50.643 --> 01:14:50.823]  Right.
[01:14:51.363 --> 01:14:58.331]  And then he's done, he does some business around here, wraps a few things up, and then he's off to meetings doing other things.
[01:14:58.371 --> 01:15:02.815]  He doesn't sit around, hang out in the office, playing video games, tweeting, doing all this other stuff.
[01:15:03.056 --> 01:15:09.663]  He's not here, you know, he's working, like he works from his house all the time, but he's not physically here that much.
[01:15:10.103 --> 01:15:11.484]  As much as it used to be.
[01:15:11.504 --> 01:15:16.386]  When I first started, we would be up here until 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock at night, shooting videos, editing, doing all kinds of stuff.
[01:15:16.406 --> 01:15:19.507]  He's earned the right to not have to be here 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:15:19.567 --> 01:15:19.867]  Exactly.
[01:15:19.907 --> 01:15:21.248]  He's got a good crew underneath him.
[01:15:22.048 --> 01:15:23.809]  We're all pretty much self-contained.
[01:15:23.849 --> 01:15:26.370]  He throws us some leads when we need them.
[01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:28.151]  Go in this direction, go in this direction.
[01:15:29.432 --> 01:15:31.533]  So I said, okay, I'll see what I can do to set it up.
[01:15:32.338 --> 01:15:37.801]  And I talked to Alex and he said, you know, see if he'll just come on the show live, because I'm really not going to have time to talk to him today.
[01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:43.625]  Well, and this is when all that stuff was going down, where they were like, oh, Alex Jones didn't show up to our interview and all that.
[01:15:43.645 --> 01:15:44.846]  This was pretty much two days after.
[01:15:45.026 --> 01:15:45.986]  Yeah.
[01:15:46.126 --> 01:15:48.748]  When he, when, was it ABC, Stephanopoulos?
[01:15:49.228 --> 01:15:49.989]  Some Sunday show.
[01:15:50.009 --> 01:15:54.892]  Yeah, they didn't, they weren't going to do it live, or they were going to do it live, then they said not to, all that stuff.
[01:15:55.672 --> 01:15:59.713]  And so I'm like, yeah, you know, he put the call out to mainstream media.
[01:15:59.754 --> 01:16:02.274]  Here's a mainstream media guy from the Boston Globe, a writer.
[01:16:02.294 --> 01:16:03.635]  I went and checked him out.
[01:16:04.555 --> 01:16:07.256]  He writes mainly about coffee and kind of social stuff.
[01:16:07.416 --> 01:16:10.997]  So I'm like, wow, I guess there, but I think he went on the campaign trail with Romney.
[01:16:11.037 --> 01:16:12.378]  So he does have some political things.
[01:16:12.438 --> 01:16:14.399]  And so they sent him here to do some Jade Helms stuff.
[01:16:14.999 --> 01:16:19.280]  And I guess he just assumed we all sit around and wait for mainstream media to contact us for interviews.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.921]  That's what we live for, which we don't.
[01:16:21.782 --> 01:16:21.942]  Right.
[01:16:22.342 --> 01:16:25.305]  But I was happy to, you know, try to see if we could work about it to get him here.
[01:16:26.006 --> 01:16:27.067]  And I said, you know, how about this?
[01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:28.508]  How about you come on live, you do the interview.
[01:16:28.569 --> 01:16:30.851]  I think this will be something good for you.
[01:16:30.871 --> 01:16:36.256]  This will probably get your name out there a lot more than, you know, where you're at now at the Boston Globes, a little small.
[01:16:37.017 --> 01:16:37.317]  I think so.
[01:16:52.714 --> 01:16:53.455]  Come here.
[01:17:14.373 --> 01:17:15.454]  And I don't read every email.
[01:17:15.494 --> 01:17:18.076]  I probably have 100,000 emails I've never read in my inbox.
[01:17:18.116 --> 01:17:19.597]  We get thousands of emails every day.
[01:17:19.777 --> 01:17:20.817]  In total insanity.
[01:17:21.398 --> 01:17:22.679]  But I do what I can.
[01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:26.241]  And so with that, we tried to get him over here.
[01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:31.044]  Then he hemmed and hawed and said, oh, well, I talked to another editor and they said, no, I can't do it.
[01:17:31.084 --> 01:17:37.108]  I said, well, don't come by the office then because we don't want to have a reporter here that we have to hang out with and babysit while we're trying to do our other jobs.
[01:17:37.608 --> 01:17:43.309]  You know, if you look at the command post in there, when they're doing the live show, there's six people working in there, and that's just the people running the show.
[01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:55.373]  We got writers, we have the guys run the warehouse, we have graphics design people, we have tech people, computer tech people, we've got the nightly news division and the reporters, and then you got customer service.
[01:17:55.393 --> 01:17:57.513]  It's a big operation here, very big operation.
[01:17:58.053 --> 01:18:00.194]  So, you know, I said, don't come here.
[01:18:01.454 --> 01:18:04.315]  And then I went on the air and told Alex that, hey, he's not coming.
[01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:07.076]  We thought he would be here, now he's not coming.
[01:18:07.956 --> 01:18:10.177]  And Alex got mad and said, that's it, we're done with him.
[01:18:10.677 --> 01:18:13.338]  Because this guy wanted to also have a phone interview.
[01:18:13.538 --> 01:18:18.080]  I said, if you come in and do one hour, 30 minutes with Alex, we'll give you a phone interview, no problem.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.361]  After the show, you can talk to Alex when he's going to a meeting.
[01:18:20.601 --> 01:18:23.142]  He said he's got to be at a meeting at 3.30 while he's driving there, he'll talk to you.
[01:18:24.342 --> 01:18:25.223]  And he could have had that.
[01:18:25.803 --> 01:18:30.765]  But he wanted to neg on his showing up here to do the interview, the first interview.
[01:18:30.785 --> 01:18:31.905]  So Jones said, that's it, we're done.
[01:18:32.025 --> 01:18:33.346]  Which he even mentions in his article.
[01:18:34.859 --> 01:18:38.481]  But he kind of makes it look like I'm the jerk who's putting it out on him.
[01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:38.962]  Yeah.
[01:18:39.562 --> 01:18:40.863]  He didn't tell him right away.
[01:18:41.103 --> 01:18:41.363]  Right.
[01:18:41.503 --> 01:18:42.964]  So it got all misconstrued.
[01:18:43.144 --> 01:18:48.327]  Well, and when I got his tweet, or his text, I texted him back after I got it.
[01:18:48.347 --> 01:18:50.568]  I didn't have, once he said he was going to do it, I put my phone down.
[01:18:50.608 --> 01:18:52.909]  I'm doing a million other things in the office getting ready for the show.
[01:18:53.309 --> 01:18:54.310]  It could be printing something.
[01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:55.991]  I even bring Alex coffee sometimes.
[01:18:56.051 --> 01:18:58.072]  I mean, whatever needs to be done, I'm here to do it.
[01:18:58.092 --> 01:19:02.014]  Everybody's here to make this, you know, push this boat forward.
[01:19:02.794 --> 01:19:06.136]  And so then he tried to make it look like we had staged this thing, which we didn't.
[01:19:06.276 --> 01:19:06.936]  Alex didn't know.
[01:19:06.996 --> 01:19:09.798]  The word did not get back to him that he was coming on.
[01:19:09.818 --> 01:19:12.880]  Because I called Alex after he said that he would do it and said, hey, he's coming on.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.700]  His name's Matt Visory.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.801]  He works for the Boston Globe.
[01:19:15.261 --> 01:19:18.082]  And Alex immediately went into this Beastie Boys thing over the phone.
[01:19:18.102 --> 01:19:18.783]  It was kind of funny.
[01:19:19.443 --> 01:19:20.203]  And I laughed.
[01:19:20.223 --> 01:19:21.524]  And then he did it on the show.
[01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:22.465]  And it was so funny.
[01:19:22.485 --> 01:19:23.745]  He even writes about it in his article.
[01:19:25.186 --> 01:19:31.709]  Hey guys, I hate to interrupt you, but Joe Biggs is out in the field right now and he'd like to say hello.
[01:19:31.989 --> 01:19:32.489]  There we go.
[01:19:32.549 --> 01:19:33.889]  Well, let's go to Joe Biggs right now.
[01:19:33.909 --> 01:19:35.490]  Joe, can you hear us?
[01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:40.092]  Alright, hold on.
[01:19:40.112 --> 01:19:44.553]  Joe Biggs is on location in Phoenix at the Islamic Community Center.
[01:19:44.874 --> 01:19:46.074]  Just getting there.
[01:19:46.854 --> 01:19:48.475]  Yeah, I'm walking up right now.
[01:19:49.198 --> 01:19:52.240]  Give me a second while I'm... Yeah, hey, we'll come back to you, Joe.
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.202]  We'll just let people know that you're on your way there.
[01:19:54.742 --> 01:19:58.825]  And get settled in and then we'll have you pop back in when you're ready to talk.
[01:19:59.365 --> 01:20:00.786]  But we do have our reporter on the ground.
[01:20:00.866 --> 01:20:02.788]  He was in Cleveland this morning.
[01:20:02.828 --> 01:20:09.713]  He was actually sending me texts at 9 o'clock this morning going, should I stay here in Cleveland because originally we were going to do an Al Sharpton protest that night.
[01:20:10.814 --> 01:20:16.399]  Because actually the people of Cleveland didn't decide to go riot and loot and do all this stuff.
[01:20:16.419 --> 01:20:22.726]  They're letting justice take their course and hopefully they're taking non-violent means to correct the problems in their community.
[01:20:23.127 --> 01:20:23.867]  Which is good to see.
[01:20:24.568 --> 01:20:27.011]  So he said, hey, there's this thing that just happened.
[01:20:27.351 --> 01:20:28.292]  It's going up in Phoenix.
[01:20:28.312 --> 01:20:31.615]  They're going to do a Draw Muhammad Part 2 and ISIS says they're going to attack.
[01:20:32.489 --> 01:20:33.230]  And I said, go.
[01:20:33.710 --> 01:20:34.211]  Immediately.
[01:20:34.391 --> 01:20:35.892]  Make that happen.
[01:20:35.912 --> 01:20:38.695]  Because you can't wait with this stuff.
[01:20:38.735 --> 01:20:42.198]  Getting to the airport now, you've got to be there an hour before the plane leaves.
[01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:47.964]  By the grace of God, Joe's there right now, one day's notice, flying from another location.
[01:20:48.004 --> 01:20:51.167]  The guy's been in Cleveland since Sunday, I believe.
[01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:53.968]  And he's going to Baltimore right after this.
[01:20:54.028 --> 01:20:58.951]  And he's going to Baltimore because they're having all hell break loose because the cops are essentially standing down.
[01:20:58.971 --> 01:21:01.892]  Kind of what we saw in New York right after the two cops got shot.
[01:21:02.152 --> 01:21:13.638]  Well, we're not going to have our standoff with Al Sharpton there, but Justin Mooney on Twitter wants us to ask if Al Sharpton is going to pay for the Baltimore riot bill as payback for his unpaid taxes.
[01:21:13.798 --> 01:21:14.479]  Oh, that would be nice.
[01:21:14.499 --> 01:21:15.039]  That would be good.
[01:21:15.419 --> 01:21:17.100]  Hey, we are getting a few questions.
[01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:19.761]  Wow, we're getting a bunch here.
[01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.382]  Who woke y'all up?
[01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:22.563]  I like that.
[01:21:22.623 --> 01:21:23.583]  That's from James Bell.
[01:21:23.603 --> 01:21:24.484]  That just came in.
[01:21:24.504 --> 01:21:27.506]  And he's at zetspony083.
[01:21:27.526 --> 01:21:28.146]  Who woke y'all up?
[01:21:32.869 --> 01:21:36.491]  I was kind of a way, I became a theater major because I always liked to peer behind the curtain.
[01:21:36.891 --> 01:21:39.754]  I was always one of those people who liked to know what was going on behind the scenes.
[01:21:40.194 --> 01:21:47.379]  And I started reading, I actually read None Dare Call It A Conspiracy and Who Runs Congress, which I have both of those books on my desk right now.
[01:21:47.419 --> 01:21:51.562]  I bought those at a used bookstore on Route 22 in Murraysville, Pennsylvania in
[01:21:53.203 --> 01:21:57.765]  I think 1993 or 4 is when I bought those.
[01:21:57.825 --> 01:22:02.107]  I had torn my ACL and I was doing a lot of reading at the time because I couldn't play sports anymore.
[01:22:02.727 --> 01:22:03.947]  And I had about a year of rehab.
[01:22:04.007 --> 01:22:05.408]  So I was reading.
[01:22:05.428 --> 01:22:05.948]  Lots of reading.
[01:22:06.068 --> 01:22:07.989]  And that's when I started playing bass guitar.
[01:22:08.009 --> 01:22:11.210]  But those two books really got me thinking of what was going on.
[01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:16.052]  And I had already kind of said to myself, Democrats and Republicans are the same thing.
[01:22:16.472 --> 01:22:17.553]  They're just in it for the money.
[01:22:18.013 --> 01:22:24.615]  They're just in it to prolong their existence in that world of DC and not really interested in helping people.
[01:22:25.376 --> 01:22:27.276]  And corporations have bought them off.
[01:22:27.336 --> 01:22:27.897]  But what about you?
[01:22:27.937 --> 01:22:28.477]  Who woke you up?
[01:22:30.323 --> 01:22:42.854]  Well, you know, it's kind of bizarre, but I was like 10 and my best friend's mom was like a real hippie and she would always talk to us about like 2012, you know, that big 2012 theory and all that.
[01:22:43.294 --> 01:22:50.200]  So that was kind of the first time when I started to see that there was something more than just things that were going on with my daily life.
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:52.382]  And then, I don't know, I guess I was like 15 or...
[01:22:53.783 --> 01:22:59.569]  Something and and a lot of my friends and I in Chicago were into like reading about the Illuminati and stuff So, I don't know.
[01:22:59.609 --> 01:23:05.015]  I guess it was just my friends and I Don't really remember any epic.
[01:23:05.095 --> 01:23:10.761]  I can't say the book or the street, but Destiny I was destined to be woken up here.
[01:23:10.781 --> 01:23:10.861]  So I
[01:23:14.835 --> 01:23:21.059]  And if people don't believe in the power of Craigslist, Leanne actually, she got hired through Craigslist.
[01:23:21.119 --> 01:23:23.521]  Marcos in there got hired through Craigslist.
[01:23:24.001 --> 01:23:26.223]  Joe Jennings got hired through Craigslist.
[01:23:28.084 --> 01:23:37.571]  You gotta watch out for that, it's a lot of... Yeah, you know we put out, that's how we do a lot of hiring, because it's immediate, you get people interested really quickly, you can send stuff, it's all over the internet.
[01:23:37.591 --> 01:23:41.854]  And you also get the people who think you're just joking and trolling them, so then they send you back really...
[01:23:43.955 --> 01:23:52.759]  I got a couple weird, you know, I could have very detailed job descriptions when we do put one out and it says specifically how I like things and that really made some guy mad.
[01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.760]  But, you know, that's neither here nor there.
[01:23:56.060 --> 01:24:01.923]  Now, before I think we go to Joe Biggs, if we can, if we do have time, I want to play, because yesterday we had Wolfgang Halbig on.
[01:24:02.916 --> 01:24:03.176]  I don't know.
[01:24:24.858 --> 01:24:25.559]  It's really long.
[01:24:25.579 --> 01:24:30.443]  There's several versions out there and several really good activists.
[01:24:30.663 --> 01:24:32.625]  One, I think her name was Kat Waters.
[01:24:32.945 --> 01:24:33.666]  I think that's her name.
[01:24:33.786 --> 01:24:34.386]  I hope that's right.
[01:24:34.406 --> 01:24:36.928]  I met her in New York, but I saw her actually one of the shots.
[01:24:36.968 --> 01:24:37.709]  I'm like, oh, I know her.
[01:24:37.729 --> 01:24:41.773]  I met her in New York when Alex did the talkers speech a few years ago.
[01:24:42.914 --> 01:24:43.534]  But she was there.
[01:24:43.554 --> 01:24:44.435]  Sorry to stop you, dude.
[01:24:44.455 --> 01:24:45.336]  We've got Nazis.
[01:24:45.936 --> 01:24:46.637]  Oh, we've got Nazis.
[01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:47.417]  Oh, all right.
[01:24:47.437 --> 01:24:48.158]  Well, let's go to that.
[01:24:48.418 --> 01:24:50.500]  Well, that's actually one of our good Twitter questions.
[01:24:55.171 --> 01:24:56.052]  So what's going on, Biggs?
[01:24:56.072 --> 01:24:56.572]  Can you hear me?
[01:24:56.652 --> 01:25:06.118]  Yeah, there's a whole line of people standing facing the mosque and in between the people are, like, riot cops.
[01:25:06.858 --> 01:25:11.041]  Excuse me.
[01:25:12.402 --> 01:25:16.344]  And then on the other side are the people that are in support of Islam.
[01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:16.804]  Wow.
[01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:19.726]  Wow, this is... This is quite a face-off, then.
[01:25:20.006 --> 01:25:22.308]  There's a lot of people screaming and yelling at each other right now.
[01:25:22.754 --> 01:25:29.321]  Is there actually any sort of contest going on or is that just a ruse to get people out there?
[01:25:29.922 --> 01:25:31.483]  There's a lot of anger out here though.
[01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:34.166]  Yeah, this is... And it's all coming from the other side right now.
[01:25:34.927 --> 01:25:36.188]  It's coming from the Muslims?
[01:25:36.208 --> 01:25:37.650]  The Muslim side or the... Yeah.
[01:25:38.010 --> 01:25:38.351]  Oh wow.
[01:25:39.171 --> 01:25:43.196]  Yeah, they're screaming and cussing and telling everybody to go F off.
[01:25:44.137 --> 01:25:44.337]  Huh.
[01:25:45.071 --> 01:25:48.253]  Well, we got a good question from somebody on Twitter, Truth Depot.
[01:25:48.353 --> 01:25:55.738]  He wants to, he's asking, do you think the people putting on the drawing contest are government agents trying to spark unrest?
[01:25:56.739 --> 01:25:58.460]  What do you think of that, Biggs, Joe Biggs?
[01:25:59.781 --> 01:26:01.843]  Do you think they got some controlled opposition in there?
[01:26:04.025 --> 01:26:06.006]  He might not even be able to hear us.
[01:26:06.246 --> 01:26:07.147]  Joe can hear us?
[01:26:07.347 --> 01:26:07.667]  Oh, you can?
[01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:08.588]  Okay.
[01:26:08.628 --> 01:26:17.313]  So do you think it's possible that these bikers, since we just had the biker incident in Texas, that maybe some of them are working as agents for the government?
[01:26:17.333 --> 01:26:19.815]  Or do you think this is just a... Try to stir up unrest.
[01:26:20.315 --> 01:26:21.016]  A natural event.
[01:26:25.799 --> 01:26:28.000]  Joe Biggs, let everyone know that you are live.
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:28.821]  He is live.
[01:26:29.081 --> 01:26:30.402]  Yeah, tell people that I'm live on TV.
[01:26:31.857 --> 01:26:34.218]  Well, I mean, there's a giant, giant crowd of people.
[01:26:34.238 --> 01:26:38.199]  I mean, you can't tell people to to not cuss and be emotional.
[01:26:38.399 --> 01:26:38.759]  Oh, no.
[01:26:38.779 --> 01:26:40.380]  Hey, you know, that's going to happen.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.560]  I totally understand.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:41.820]  Yeah.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:42.381]  All right.
[01:26:42.401 --> 01:26:43.681]  How you doing?
[01:26:43.741 --> 01:26:43.921]  Good.
[01:26:43.981 --> 01:26:44.941]  All right.
[01:26:45.001 --> 01:26:45.482]  Well, let's.
[01:26:45.722 --> 01:26:46.822]  So what do you think?
[01:26:48.122 --> 01:26:50.883]  I think it's my First Amendment right to be out here.
[01:26:51.384 --> 01:26:51.624]  Yeah.
[01:26:51.664 --> 01:26:52.324]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:26:52.344 --> 01:26:52.824]  Yeah.
[01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:57.306]  If this if Mohammed is going to cry over a cartoon, what about Jesus?
[01:26:57.326 --> 01:26:58.006]  He never cried.
[01:26:58.186 --> 01:26:59.126]  He's not crying about it.
[01:26:59.146 --> 01:27:00.006]  He's saying, go for it.
[01:27:00.687 --> 01:27:01.347]  It doesn't matter.
[01:27:01.735 --> 01:27:04.437]  Well, when I'm in the United States, I defended this country.
[01:27:04.858 --> 01:27:11.343]  I will not back down from anybody trying to stamp on my rights, including Mr. Obama!
[01:27:13.746 --> 01:27:16.248]  Let the mind be free!
[01:27:16.288 --> 01:27:19.190]  Now, this seems like it was totally spontaneous.
[01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:21.392]  It was just announced this morning that they were going to do this, right?
[01:27:21.492 --> 01:27:22.994]  No, I think it's been a couple days.
[01:27:23.014 --> 01:27:23.955]  It's been a couple days?
[01:27:23.975 --> 01:27:26.717]  The guy over here on the other side, there's two guys over on the other side.
[01:27:26.737 --> 01:27:28.859]  They keep trying to pick fights with people.
[01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:30.378]  Oh, well, of course.
[01:27:30.438 --> 01:27:39.469]  That's... Well, and that's the question that we just, uh, we have from one of our Twitter... Oh yeah, the guy's flipping people off and all black.
[01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.611]  Yeah.
[01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:49.775]  And see, that was, that was kind of one of the issues that I had with this, is that this, this, this wasn't like a planned cartoon event.
[01:27:49.896 --> 01:27:58.740]  I mean, they're going to be, they're telling people to bring their cartoons, bring their drawings that they did, and then they're going to announce a winner at the end of it to make it be some sort of a thing.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:05.404]  But, you know, I really got the impression that this was sort of a provocatoring type event.
[01:28:05.424 --> 01:28:07.385]  So what do you think, what do you think about this today?
[01:28:09.085 --> 01:28:13.769]  I think it's Americans fed up with being told what to say and how to say it.
[01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:18.713]  And our government isn't condemning any of the stuff going on in the Middle East.
[01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:20.794]  They seem to be fine with what's going on.
[01:28:20.815 --> 01:28:23.036]  They won't say burning down a church is an act of terror.
[01:28:23.156 --> 01:28:33.325]  One of the reasons why the person who put this event on wanted to go to this specific mosque is that the two guys who came to Waco
[01:28:33.905 --> 01:28:44.579]  The two terrorist wannabes who went to Waco and attacked or attempted to attack the people there are from this mosque, or they had ties to this mosque.
[01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:51.848]  So that's why they are out here protesting outside of the Islamic community mosque there in Phoenix.
[01:28:53.032 --> 01:29:02.296]  And so, yeah, I mean, David Knight said it earlier that the First Amendment has been worth dying for in the past.
[01:29:02.696 --> 01:29:07.758]  So, you know, I don't think that that's something that they really want to do.
[01:29:07.798 --> 01:29:11.500]  But they said, you know, exercise your Second Amendment if our First Amendment
[01:29:13.266 --> 01:29:13.846]  is crushed.
[01:29:14.446 --> 01:29:16.987]  Biggs, give us a layout of the size here.
[01:29:17.048 --> 01:29:22.330]  How many people seem to be with the bikers and with the draw Muhammad cartoon rally?
[01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:25.931]  And then how many are, I guess, with the mosque, with the Islamic center?
[01:29:27.111 --> 01:29:35.795]  I'd say maybe 300 right now on the Islam side and about 3,000 on the other side over here.
[01:29:35.815 --> 01:29:36.255]  Wow.
[01:29:36.695 --> 01:29:37.616]  And then how many police?
[01:29:37.776 --> 01:29:38.336]  How many police?
[01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:41.117]  Probably about
[01:29:42.216 --> 01:29:44.680]  I don't know, I'd say 3-4 thousand in an area.
[01:29:45.241 --> 01:29:47.946]  I mean right here in front of me, probably about 60-70.
[01:29:48.567 --> 01:29:50.370]  But uh, I mean they're around every corner.
[01:29:50.410 --> 01:29:51.852]  There's more showing up right now.
[01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:52.393]  Right.
[01:29:52.874 --> 01:29:55.438]  Yeah, now it looks like they're putting up a barricade between the two groups.
[01:29:58.035 --> 01:29:58.295]  Yeah.
[01:29:58.655 --> 01:29:58.955]  Okay.
[01:29:59.196 --> 01:29:59.856]  This is just insane.
[01:29:59.896 --> 01:30:03.118]  But, you know, notice these guys aren't in riot gear.
[01:30:03.818 --> 01:30:11.682]  I mean, they have riot helmets on, but it's not the full battle armor, tear gas, ready to just wipe the floor with people.
[01:30:11.742 --> 01:30:14.003]  They're just there to keep the peace.
[01:30:14.163 --> 01:30:14.804]  Peace officers.
[01:30:15.544 --> 01:30:17.645]  Do you see anyone with open carry?
[01:30:18.986 --> 01:30:19.946]  Hey, guys!
[01:30:20.967 --> 01:30:22.167]  How many are open carrying right now?
[01:30:22.207 --> 01:30:24.469]  I've got two guys trying to kill a friend of mine!
[01:30:26.189 --> 01:30:26.910]  Love your neighbor?
[01:30:29.241 --> 01:30:29.741]  What's going on?
[01:30:31.102 --> 01:30:34.544]  Well, previous to the shooting in Texas.
[01:30:34.604 --> 01:30:35.324]  Yeah, that's where I'm from.
[01:30:35.604 --> 01:30:42.508]  Okay, there were two guys from this mosque that got convicted in federal court for conspiracy for terrorism, right?
[01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:48.091]  So we got two guys convicted, two guys out of this mosque went to go shoot somebody that I know personally.
[01:30:49.252 --> 01:30:55.295]  So apparently, I'll hold it up, this cartoon by Bosch Boston was the winning cartoon in Texas.
[01:30:55.315 --> 01:30:56.816]  Move this way a little bit so the light's on you.
[01:30:58.482 --> 01:31:04.963]  So this was the winning cartoon in Texas, in Garland, by Bosh Fonstein.
[01:31:05.303 --> 01:31:07.104]  This was apparently worth being killed over.
[01:31:08.204 --> 01:31:09.564]  He was going to die for this.
[01:31:10.884 --> 01:31:12.485]  This is actually somebody I know personally.
[01:31:12.505 --> 01:31:15.685]  This is a personal issue for me.
[01:31:15.725 --> 01:31:18.246]  He's a former Muslim.
[01:31:18.426 --> 01:31:24.127]  At 9-11, he went back and studied the Quran seriously, and he read it, and he determined it was evil.
[01:31:25.922 --> 01:31:28.564]  Adopted a new philosophy and became an atheist.
[01:31:28.984 --> 01:31:31.406]  And now he's got a death warrant against him.
[01:31:31.426 --> 01:31:34.148]  He gets countless death threats every single day because of this.
[01:31:35.349 --> 01:31:38.431]  If we can't speak out, we can't speak, we can't think.
[01:31:39.211 --> 01:31:45.115]  The ultimate goal is to destroy intellectual freedom and the ability for persuasion instead of violence.
[01:31:46.756 --> 01:31:53.461]  If we can't talk, we can't think, we can't be intellectual, we can't debate, we can't persuade, we cannot use channels that are non-violent.
[01:31:54.226 --> 01:31:55.427]  This is what they want to stop.
[01:31:55.667 --> 01:31:56.907]  They want to stop thinking.
[01:31:56.927 --> 01:31:58.148]  They want to stop debate.
[01:31:59.148 --> 01:32:01.870]  They want to stop persuasion because they're against persuasion.
[01:32:01.890 --> 01:32:03.250]  They're for force.
[01:32:04.831 --> 01:32:06.392]  This is just an intellectual issue.
[01:32:06.552 --> 01:32:07.252]  It's on paper.
[01:32:07.352 --> 01:32:08.053]  That's all it is.
[01:32:08.073 --> 01:32:10.914]  It's that simple.
[01:32:11.034 --> 01:32:13.535]  And I'm shocked that behind me there are supporters.
[01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:14.876]  All they had to do was check.
[01:32:15.336 --> 01:32:16.697]  This mosque has supported.
[01:32:17.398 --> 01:32:20.821]  Many people that have gone out and started jihad activities.
[01:32:21.001 --> 01:32:22.862]  They've had two people convicted in federal court.
[01:32:23.243 --> 01:32:24.964]  And they had two shooters from this mosque.
[01:32:26.786 --> 01:32:27.766]  How much more do you need?
[01:32:28.307 --> 01:32:30.549]  Ultimately, we're all motivated by ideas.
[01:32:31.589 --> 01:32:32.150]  Very well said.
[01:32:32.170 --> 01:32:32.590]  Get his name, Vic.
[01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:33.691]  They take ideas seriously.
[01:32:33.931 --> 01:32:34.432]  They do!
[01:32:34.872 --> 01:32:35.272]  What's your name?
[01:32:35.292 --> 01:32:35.853]  They act on it.
[01:32:36.013 --> 01:32:37.154]  My name is Jonathan Connolly.
[01:32:37.354 --> 01:32:37.634]  Man.
[01:32:38.475 --> 01:32:39.075]  Very well said.
[01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.657]  I'm going to get his contact info.
[01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:43.530]  This is ultimately an intellectual battle.
[01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:45.771]  But they bring it to us as a physical battle.
[01:32:45.811 --> 01:32:47.551]  We have to respond in some fashion.
[01:32:48.231 --> 01:32:49.372]  This is how we respond.
[01:32:50.012 --> 01:32:51.633]  We hold up and we speak.
[01:32:52.613 --> 01:32:54.894]  What is the alternative besides that?
[01:32:56.094 --> 01:33:00.176]  You know, and we were trying to do that at the hashtag Black Lives Matter protest.
[01:33:00.676 --> 01:33:05.958]  We were trying to hold up signs and speak for the ones that can't be spoken for.
[01:33:06.298 --> 01:33:08.179]  These little babies that are being killed.
[01:33:08.239 --> 01:33:09.520]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:33:10.714 --> 01:33:13.979]  Now you see they put up this huge thing up.
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:18.246]  They've got an area lane for the police and now everyone's chanting USA.
[01:33:18.967 --> 01:33:20.850]  It's quite a crowd.
[01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:21.311]  Yeah.
[01:33:27.182 --> 01:33:29.704]  Friday afternoon in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:33.707]  This is the side of the Islamic Cultural Center?
[01:33:34.047 --> 01:33:36.849]  It's the Islamic Community Mosque.
[01:33:36.869 --> 01:33:38.230]  There's a good aerial shot right there.
[01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:41.212]  You can see the two sides facing off.
[01:33:41.652 --> 01:33:43.494]  I can see the American flags on one side.
[01:33:44.374 --> 01:33:47.597]  And then you can see the Muslim crowd.
[01:33:47.637 --> 01:33:48.978]  They look almost the same size.
[01:33:49.178 --> 01:33:51.379]  Can I see your sign?
[01:33:53.241 --> 01:33:53.401]  Yeah.
[01:33:53.421 --> 01:33:55.102]  Come over this way a little bit so the light's on.
[01:33:55.776 --> 01:33:57.317]  Look at Biggs giving camera direction.
[01:33:58.959 --> 01:33:59.619]  Can you guys see that?
[01:33:59.939 --> 01:34:01.120]  Yeah, there's the Charlie Hebdo.
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.382]  Yeah, we see the Charlie Hebdo cartoon.
[01:34:03.482 --> 01:34:04.563]  It says don't mess with Texas.
[01:34:05.544 --> 01:34:08.587]  Yeah, well and that's actually when they had a few ISIS people.
[01:34:08.647 --> 01:34:10.968]  ISIS negative 2, Texas plus 2.
[01:34:12.610 --> 01:34:12.870]  Right.
[01:34:13.791 --> 01:34:16.973]  Well that's why... Biggs, what's your opinion?
[01:34:16.993 --> 01:34:21.117]  Do you think violence could kick off at any time or does it look like it's just going to be a shouting match?
[01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:26.412]  Yeah, there's definitely some violent, angry people on the other side right now.
[01:34:26.432 --> 01:34:30.655]  I mean, they're coming out and screaming at people and flipping everyone off.
[01:34:31.335 --> 01:34:34.177]  Definitely not being peaceful at this moment in time, I'll tell you that.
[01:34:34.197 --> 01:34:43.482]  Well, how do you feel knowing that ISIS was making some threats on Twitter or some of their wannabe jihadists were threatening this event on Twitter?
[01:34:43.502 --> 01:34:48.505]  And now on the other side, they're flying the flag upside down.
[01:34:48.525 --> 01:34:50.406]  I don't know if you guys can see that.
[01:34:52.034 --> 01:34:52.615]  On the other side?
[01:34:52.635 --> 01:34:54.616]  That's just a sign of distress, Donna.
[01:34:54.636 --> 01:34:55.957]  I don't think they realize that.
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:01.321]  That's just a sign of distress.
[01:35:01.982 --> 01:35:03.443]  That means your country is in distress.
[01:35:03.503 --> 01:35:11.289]  Well, and that's the thing that's so important to let people know is that this is America and the First Amendment is very important to us.
[01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:12.671]  People have died.
[01:35:13.922 --> 01:35:16.184]  To ensure that we have that right.
[01:35:17.565 --> 01:35:30.374]  And I don't know if the Muslim side of these people are supporting what ISIS is doing, or supporting what Al Qaeda is doing, but one thing's for sure, and it's come out, we talked about it right in the beginning, but we are funding Al Qaeda.
[01:35:30.414 --> 01:35:33.816]  We jump-started ISIS, essentially, into what's going on now.
[01:35:33.836 --> 01:35:37.079]  It's used them as a proxy army, and now they're running wild.
[01:35:37.719 --> 01:35:39.160]  And that's what happens with these incidents.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.823]  I was reading an article, I've got one up here from the Wall Street Journal from May 25th, talking about the Battle of Ramadi.
[01:35:45.123 --> 01:35:46.104]  Now let me ask you this, Biggs.
[01:35:46.964 --> 01:35:47.204]  Yeah.
[01:35:47.304 --> 01:35:50.286]  So the Battle of Ramadi started around May 5th.
[01:35:50.886 --> 01:36:01.192]  It talks about that the Islamic State launched an attack, Iraqis held them off with helicopters in the Golden Division, and then on the 13th, ISIS established a sniper nest and started taking out some people.
[01:36:01.272 --> 01:36:03.853]  Then on the 14th, they bring in an armored bulldozer.
[01:36:03.873 --> 01:36:04.654]  They were live right now on the news.
[01:36:05.174 --> 01:36:08.398]  And spend over an hour clearing out a concrete barricade.
[01:36:08.838 --> 01:36:13.843]  Now how come we didn't have any drones up in the air watching this and taking out this armored bulldozer?
[01:36:14.344 --> 01:36:15.385]  Biggs, let me ask you that.
[01:36:16.005 --> 01:36:26.216]  How could we, if we're supporting with air support on this campaign, how do we not take out this armored bulldozer that was breaking through the blockades that they put going into Ramadi?
[01:36:27.913 --> 01:36:28.973]  I mean that would be easy to do.
[01:36:44.718 --> 01:36:46.420]  And most of these were made from captured U.S.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.902]  military armored vehicles designed to be impervious to small arms fire.
[01:36:49.922 --> 01:36:55.346]  So they were able to drive these into the city, blow up the outer defenses, and then invade.
[01:36:55.366 --> 01:36:56.127]  Wow.
[01:36:56.167 --> 01:36:58.469]  And we didn't have any air support, and that's how it fell.
[01:36:58.909 --> 01:37:01.031]  They were able to cut the groups in half.
[01:37:01.091 --> 01:37:03.653]  The Golden Division was cut off from the rest, and then everybody retreated.
[01:37:04.656 --> 01:37:11.858]  I mean, if that's not picture-perfect, tell-tale evidence that we don't care what's going on with ISIS, we're just letting them run wild.
[01:37:11.978 --> 01:37:12.238]  Right.
[01:37:12.578 --> 01:37:13.458]  Think about the people that died.
[01:37:13.478 --> 01:37:15.319]  Ever dropping them weapons, the Iraqis are mad.
[01:37:15.599 --> 01:37:23.481]  And it's probably because the Iraqis have been coming out saying, hey, you're dropping them weapons, we've seen your helicopters, we fired at your helicopters because we see them bringing them weapons.
[01:37:24.521 --> 01:37:25.062]  It's ridiculous.
[01:37:25.322 --> 01:37:27.022]  Joe Biggs, your comments, if you could hear any of that.
[01:37:30.323 --> 01:37:31.803]  You were cutting out on that.
[01:37:31.843 --> 01:37:33.804]  You were saying about in Ramadi how it fell.
[01:37:34.537 --> 01:37:41.659]  Yeah, it just seemed like there was ample opportunity for drone strikes to be used in this fashion to repel an attack.
[01:37:41.719 --> 01:37:46.181]  I mean, there was ample opportunity to take out ISIS back this time last year.
[01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:50.502]  They were convoying in from the northern part down into Iraq.
[01:37:50.542 --> 01:37:52.703]  I mean, we could have done successive bracketing.
[01:37:52.723 --> 01:37:54.063]  There's all kinds of things we could have used.
[01:37:54.483 --> 01:37:59.505]  We could have done, you know, hit the first convoy, stop the convoy, then hit the last vehicle so no one can back up.
[01:37:59.841 --> 01:38:04.164]  And then he got it pinned right there, and then he just started nailing them with, uh, you know, airstrikes.
[01:38:04.204 --> 01:38:04.844]  It had been over with.
[01:38:04.944 --> 01:38:06.125]  We wouldn't be where we are today.
[01:38:06.525 --> 01:38:08.587]  And yet we allowed them to come into Iraq.
[01:38:08.607 --> 01:38:16.492]  We allowed them to take it back over after we found a reason to go into Iraq for these weapons of mass destruction that we were told.
[01:38:16.832 --> 01:38:22.916]  And then we send countless human beings lives to go over there and die for something that was a lie.
[01:38:23.256 --> 01:38:27.079]  And now we're letting this Frankenstein monster that we've created
[01:38:27.455 --> 01:38:30.238]  Come back and destroy the country that we helped try to get back.
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:32.842]  And now they're taking everything over.
[01:38:33.122 --> 01:38:35.986]  We're accidentally air dropping supplies to them.
[01:38:36.426 --> 01:38:37.808]  You know, I mean, it's just out of control.
[01:38:38.088 --> 01:38:40.491]  And then we're offering no air support at all.
[01:38:40.992 --> 01:38:41.232]  Yeah.
[01:38:41.252 --> 01:38:45.958]  You know, at least if you're going to say we're going to offer air support and drone strikes and missile strikes, then do it.
[01:38:46.994 --> 01:38:51.116]  You know, don't let city after city just fall and go, we don't know what's going on.
[01:38:51.356 --> 01:38:55.938]  But don't show video of the ISIS convoys.
[01:38:55.978 --> 01:38:58.079]  Don't show video of that because that's old news.
[01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:03.642]  That's when they came out, the Obama administration went to Fox and said, don't show video of that anymore because we don't like it.
[01:39:03.662 --> 01:39:04.402]  Because, you know why?
[01:39:04.442 --> 01:39:10.545]  Because you see them in brand new vehicles, you see them in Humvees that we've delivered there and just left for them to take.
[01:39:10.605 --> 01:39:11.766]  It's totally ludicrous.
[01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:12.966]  Totally ludicrous.
[01:39:13.086 --> 01:39:14.367]  And then Judicial Watch comes out.
[01:39:14.947 --> 01:39:16.348]  Secret Pentagon Report reveals U.S.
[01:39:16.368 --> 01:39:19.009]  created ISIS as a tool to overthrow Syria's President Assad.
[01:39:19.329 --> 01:39:20.089]  Right.
[01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:23.571]  All the proof is there and it's stuff we've been saying for a long time.
[01:39:25.451 --> 01:39:26.692]  We didn't just come up with this.
[01:39:27.152 --> 01:39:27.913]  You go search.
[01:39:27.993 --> 01:39:33.615]  Just go to the Alex Jones Channel and search for videos on we created ISIS and you'll find tons of videos.
[01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:37.256]  We've been saying it since day one that this is a proxy army that we created.
[01:39:37.657 --> 01:39:38.297]  And that's what we do.
[01:39:38.337 --> 01:39:39.497]  We fund proxy armies.
[01:39:40.138 --> 01:39:42.859]  We had a guy who sent in a question
[01:39:43.859 --> 01:39:46.222]  Oh, I guess I can't find it out.
[01:39:46.282 --> 01:39:49.785]  Mortish, pre-coach, I'm sorry, something94.
[01:39:49.825 --> 01:39:53.669]  Mortish is asking, this was set up three weeks ago on Facebook.
[01:39:53.789 --> 01:39:54.851]  Oh, it was set up three weeks ago?
[01:39:54.931 --> 01:39:55.131]  Okay.
[01:39:55.271 --> 01:39:58.034]  Well, here's Lord Boneshatter, says, I live in Canada.
[01:39:58.054 --> 01:40:02.038]  Is there a chance Alex could cover laws that tread on our freedom?
[01:40:02.881 --> 01:40:05.884]  Well, let me tell you, Alex can't cover everything.
[01:40:06.004 --> 01:40:10.007]  I would say, Lord Boneshatter, you get on YouTube and you start covering things.
[01:40:10.447 --> 01:40:13.570]  Hook up with like-minded Canadians in your area.
[01:40:13.650 --> 01:40:16.973]  Dan Dix is a guy who lives in Canada, and he's out there fighting for freedom.
[01:40:16.993 --> 01:40:17.754]  Why aren't you doing it?
[01:40:17.814 --> 01:40:18.434]  You get out there.
[01:40:18.794 --> 01:40:22.978]  You know, if you have a phone, you could post a video and put it up on YouTube.
[01:40:23.018 --> 01:40:24.459]  You can be your own activist.
[01:40:24.559 --> 01:40:27.262]  If you don't like the way things are going, then get up and change it.
[01:40:28.197 --> 01:40:30.300]  And we'll probably have you on the show if we like what you're doing.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:39.071]  Well haven't we just launched, and I hate to talk about this, I don't have all the facts on it, but aren't we launching that new YouTube site to help people out with that?
[01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:42.030]  Well, we're... Revolution News or something?
[01:40:42.851 --> 01:40:46.931]  Actually, we just launched another YouTube channel, and this one we're not even monetizing.
[01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:50.332]  We're going to see how we can grow it organically, and we're trying different things.
[01:40:51.092 --> 01:40:57.434]  And actually, Kit and Travis are taking that on, and we're posting some videos to that.
[01:40:58.074 --> 01:41:03.075]  Because, you know, the Alex Jones Channel is so big, it's got so many subscribers,
[01:41:04.175 --> 01:41:06.776]  You know, we're trying to find out who's, how it's fresh out there.
[01:41:06.796 --> 01:41:07.856]  It's Resistance News.
[01:41:07.916 --> 01:41:09.137]  That's our newest channel.
[01:41:09.157 --> 01:41:12.958]  We actually put up John Bowne's FIFA Distraction Exposed.
[01:41:13.638 --> 01:41:15.359]  And that's what's really, you know, that's one of the things.
[01:41:15.639 --> 01:41:17.019]  The media is going crazy.
[01:41:17.099 --> 01:41:20.861]  Twitter's going crazy about this election for FIFA.
[01:41:21.161 --> 01:41:22.041]  I mean, really?
[01:41:22.581 --> 01:41:23.802]  That's what you people care about?
[01:41:23.822 --> 01:41:24.402]  Right.
[01:41:24.622 --> 01:41:25.302]  We don't care about the TPP?
[01:41:25.342 --> 01:41:27.923]  What about the racketeering in our own election going on?
[01:41:28.283 --> 01:41:28.523]  Yeah.
[01:41:28.943 --> 01:41:29.964]  We don't care about the TPP.
[01:41:29.984 --> 01:41:32.165]  We don't care about World War III possibly happening.
[01:41:32.205 --> 01:41:37.628]  I mean, Putin's basically saying he thinks that NATO is going to have no choice but to use nuclear weapons on.
[01:41:38.048 --> 01:41:39.789]  I mean, that's where it's come to now.
[01:41:40.369 --> 01:41:42.950]  We've re-circled around back to the Cold War.
[01:41:43.110 --> 01:41:48.773]  Well, they know that there's so many people in the world that are football fans, so that's an easy distraction there.
[01:41:49.013 --> 01:41:50.494]  It's a very easy distraction.
[01:41:50.594 --> 01:41:52.295]  And, what, there's not corruption in sports?
[01:41:52.475 --> 01:41:52.815]  Come on.
[01:41:53.175 --> 01:41:54.636]  There's corruption in every sport.
[01:41:54.996 --> 01:41:57.997]  But, I'm sorry, bread and circuses at this point is not important.
[01:41:58.037 --> 01:41:59.778]  We need to really dig down.
[01:42:00.258 --> 01:42:03.620]  ISIS being created by the United States government, that's a big issue.
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.441]  That's something people should be concerned about.
[01:42:06.781 --> 01:42:09.983]  You know, they're now releasing these Dennis Hasser sex scandals.
[01:42:10.003 --> 01:42:10.783]  They're going after him.
[01:42:10.803 --> 01:42:12.064]  You and David talked about it earlier.
[01:42:12.084 --> 01:42:12.344]  Right.
[01:42:12.924 --> 01:42:13.705]  And they can't even...
[01:42:14.525 --> 01:42:15.706]  Put him on trial for that stuff.
[01:42:15.786 --> 01:42:18.027]  Well, and that's not even what they've come after him for.
[01:42:18.047 --> 01:42:20.009]  No, they're going after him for taking out his money.
[01:42:20.089 --> 01:42:25.492]  Yeah, they don't want you to focus on the structuring so that you go, hey, what's the big deal with taking out your own money?
[01:42:26.413 --> 01:42:30.055]  They want you to focus on the sex scandal and on all the perversion.
[01:42:30.075 --> 01:42:31.336]  And they're like, that's the issue.
[01:42:31.356 --> 01:42:31.956]  That's the problem.
[01:42:31.996 --> 01:42:32.817]  He's a bad man.
[01:42:33.217 --> 01:42:35.378]  But that's not what they came after him for.
[01:42:35.458 --> 01:42:38.200]  They didn't care that he did that decades ago.
[01:42:38.721 --> 01:42:41.783]  And whoever was his victim, I mean, they were working
[01:42:43.075 --> 01:42:45.616]  A huge payout or whatever, which is not illegal.
[01:42:45.896 --> 01:42:52.017]  If he had gone with an attorney to do something like that, settle out of court with the victim, that's completely legal to do.
[01:42:52.497 --> 01:42:59.419]  But here, because he didn't want to tell the FBI what he was up to with that cash money, that's why they came after him.
[01:42:59.919 --> 01:43:01.399]  I need to know everything anyway.
[01:43:01.619 --> 01:43:07.441]  Hey, Joe, if you can hear us, tell us what's going on right now out in Phoenix on location at the Islamic Cultural Center.
[01:43:07.461 --> 01:43:09.681]  Or is it the Islamic Community Center?
[01:43:09.701 --> 01:43:10.361]  I keep saying it wrong.
[01:43:10.642 --> 01:43:12.502]  The Islamic Community Center in Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:15.490]  Looks like he's turning.
[01:43:15.570 --> 01:43:16.091]  Okay, there we go.
[01:43:16.111 --> 01:43:17.071]  Alright, yeah.
[01:43:17.371 --> 01:43:18.452]  Tell us what's going on, Joe.
[01:43:18.472 --> 01:43:20.673]  There's a lot of people out here.
[01:43:20.713 --> 01:43:23.214]  There's screaming going on on both sides.
[01:43:23.895 --> 01:43:25.435]  Mostly from the other side, screaming over.
[01:43:25.455 --> 01:43:29.557]  And then, uh, you've got some people, looks like they've kind of infiltrated and came on our side.
[01:43:29.938 --> 01:43:32.519]  So the cops have been kind of like walking around, keeping an eye on them.
[01:43:33.427 --> 01:43:35.890]  Yeah, keep an eye on those people because those are the ones that will attack.
[01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:40.515]  This is exactly, I guess they're taking right from the Communist playbook.
[01:43:40.575 --> 01:43:43.578]  We had to deal with a smaller version of this a few months ago.
[01:43:43.598 --> 01:43:46.081]  Oh, there's an evil gun carrier big.
[01:43:46.101 --> 01:43:46.961]  Are you scared?
[01:43:46.981 --> 01:43:48.643]  There's a gun.
[01:43:48.663 --> 01:43:49.845]  There's some open carry.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.102]  Well, I actually have my HD firearms rifle on me right now.
[01:43:54.423 --> 01:43:55.083]  Oh my goodness.
[01:43:55.363 --> 01:43:56.024]  How dare you.
[01:43:56.524 --> 01:43:58.725]  So that's why everyone coming up talking to you.
[01:43:59.346 --> 01:44:07.311]  So Davis Absolute, he's a Phoenix native and he's asking you to interview... It's got the tripod on it, or the bipod.
[01:44:08.452 --> 01:44:08.972]  Very good.
[01:44:10.133 --> 01:44:11.794]  Look at that smile on his face.
[01:44:12.154 --> 01:44:14.356]  And I've shot that same gun.
[01:44:14.376 --> 01:44:16.097]  That gun shoots like a Cadillac.
[01:44:20.228 --> 01:44:20.868]  Into the crowd.
[01:44:21.248 --> 01:44:24.010]  Wielding knives, you hear that?
[01:44:24.090 --> 01:44:24.610]  Of course.
[01:44:25.630 --> 01:44:28.111]  The guy just said that he's like a security guy.
[01:44:28.592 --> 01:44:37.635]  He said that there's word that there's guys on the other side that have knives and they've heard him say that they're gonna come jump like bum rush the line and come over here and start stabbing people.
[01:44:37.935 --> 01:44:38.196]  What?
[01:44:38.536 --> 01:44:40.456]  Okay, tell that to the cops.
[01:44:40.717 --> 01:44:41.717]  Do the cops know this?
[01:44:42.577 --> 01:44:46.199]  Rob, have they never heard you don't bring a knife to a gunfight?
[01:44:46.786 --> 01:44:48.747]  Yeah, but that's going to get... Oh my.
[01:44:48.767 --> 01:44:49.528]  That's going to be crazy.
[01:44:49.548 --> 01:44:50.668]  This is almost insane.
[01:44:50.688 --> 01:44:54.331]  Joe Jennings popped in.
[01:44:54.351 --> 01:44:57.552]  I don't know if that went out over the air, but he said, you don't bring a knife to a gunfight.
[01:44:57.593 --> 01:45:00.434]  You've got a lot of armed patriots there.
[01:45:02.616 --> 01:45:06.218]  So Biggs, we have a Davis Absolute on Twitter.
[01:45:06.278 --> 01:45:14.162]  He's a Phoenix native and he's asking you to interview Muslims and peaceful Christian protesters that are in the blue shirts.
[01:45:14.263 --> 01:45:15.683]  They've blocked us off.
[01:45:15.703 --> 01:45:16.464]  We can't go over there.
[01:45:16.991 --> 01:45:18.352]  Well I think they're on both sides.
[01:45:18.392 --> 01:45:19.793]  They're the ones in the blue shirts.
[01:45:20.273 --> 01:45:22.174]  So I guess there's a big group of them.
[01:45:22.955 --> 01:45:24.456]  You might have just passed one right there.
[01:45:24.476 --> 01:45:25.836]  There's a blue shirt right there.
[01:45:25.937 --> 01:45:27.578]  Yeah but that's just a dirty t-shirt.
[01:45:27.598 --> 01:45:31.000]  Those guys have stuff written on theirs over there.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.461]  They're darker blue.
[01:45:33.501 --> 01:45:36.183]  I'll see but I mean they've got lines up.
[01:45:36.869 --> 01:45:37.189]  Yeah.
[01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:46.895]  So we're getting a lot of questions, people wondering if this is part of Jade Helm, if this is going to be used to foment civil unrest and be used for that.
[01:45:46.935 --> 01:45:52.959]  Of course, obviously, if a knife in a gunfight starts going off, that's going to change the game.
[01:45:53.399 --> 01:46:01.445]  The guy over here with the hat on, the group looking, he's the one that's been saying he's going to come over here apparently and start stabbing people.
[01:46:01.725 --> 01:46:01.965]  Really?
[01:46:04.383 --> 01:46:07.384]  He's the shorter guy, right in front of you.
[01:46:07.464 --> 01:46:08.604]  Yeah, I can't get across.
[01:46:08.664 --> 01:46:10.384]  As soon as you get close to this thing, they come at you.
[01:46:11.024 --> 01:46:13.005]  Yeah, I will.
[01:46:14.045 --> 01:46:17.426]  I think they decided there might be a security issue here today.
[01:46:17.506 --> 01:46:18.126]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:46:18.166 --> 01:46:18.526]  No wonder.
[01:46:19.186 --> 01:46:23.827]  Texas don't even get to do this half the time.
[01:46:24.287 --> 01:46:26.928]  So what do you think about all this?
[01:46:27.964 --> 01:46:29.045]  What do you guys think about this today?
[01:46:29.105 --> 01:46:33.009]  Uh, it's still bound to start going up.
[01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:36.992]  If we get more action down there, it's really going to get heated up.
[01:46:37.032 --> 01:46:37.152]  Where?
[01:46:37.213 --> 01:46:38.574]  Right down here.
[01:46:38.954 --> 01:46:39.775]  So what's going on now?
[01:46:39.795 --> 01:46:40.255]  Where is it?
[01:46:40.416 --> 01:46:43.058]  Down here we had a couple guys that look like they're provokers.
[01:46:43.418 --> 01:46:44.659]  Provocateurs?
[01:46:44.699 --> 01:46:45.680]  Yeah, a couple guys.
[01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.082]  Oh, there's a guy over here in the hat.
[01:46:47.322 --> 01:46:49.204]  They're saying he's the one that wants to come across the line of it.
[01:46:49.224 --> 01:46:50.004]  Yeah, well, there's another.
[01:46:50.124 --> 01:46:51.386]  You see the big guy out here?
[01:46:51.606 --> 01:46:52.567]  He's another big one.
[01:46:52.587 --> 01:46:53.728]  Yeah, he was starting it.
[01:46:54.443 --> 01:46:59.567]  Infowars.com reporter Joe Biggs is on the ground in Phoenix, Arizona at the Draw Muhammad Part 2 protest.
[01:46:59.607 --> 01:47:00.948]  For those of you just joining us.
[01:47:23.806 --> 01:47:26.426]  So there's guys coming over here and they're getting on the other side of this fence.
[01:47:27.367 --> 01:47:27.987]  They're coming over.
[01:47:28.007 --> 01:47:32.608]  I guess that's like a little area where a lot of the Muslims live.
[01:47:32.908 --> 01:47:36.548]  And they're over there at the gate and they keep coming over here provoking and then they run back over to the other side.
[01:47:37.308 --> 01:47:38.229]  Private property.
[01:47:38.309 --> 01:47:41.889]  And look, we're respecting their private property by not going back over there.
[01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:44.970]  It's like a helicopter.
[01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:46.270]  Is that the Fox News chopper?
[01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:48.470]  It's just blue and white.
[01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:49.010]  I can't tell.
[01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:49.470]  Okay.
[01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:52.431]  Hey, if you guys have that aerial shot, guys, go to that every once in a while too.
[01:47:53.459 --> 01:47:54.620]  Yeah, it's the Phoenix Police.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:55.761]  Oh, we don't?
[01:47:55.881 --> 01:47:56.261]  Okay.
[01:47:56.281 --> 01:47:57.402]  We had an aerial shot earlier.
[01:47:57.462 --> 01:47:57.823]  Oh, come here.
[01:47:58.323 --> 01:47:59.024]  Come on this side.
[01:47:59.704 --> 01:48:01.306]  Our aerial shot has turned into this.
[01:48:01.986 --> 01:48:02.767]  They've gone to the ground.
[01:48:03.067 --> 01:48:03.528]  Okay.
[01:48:04.489 --> 01:48:05.710]  I got these two guys with me right here.
[01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:06.150]  What's your name?
[01:48:06.370 --> 01:48:06.710]  Darren.
[01:48:06.991 --> 01:48:07.391]  Darren?
[01:48:07.551 --> 01:48:07.771]  Mike.
[01:48:08.412 --> 01:48:08.672]  Mike.
[01:48:09.393 --> 01:48:10.974]  And you're an Info Wars fan, huh?
[01:48:10.994 --> 01:48:11.595]  That's right.
[01:48:12.075 --> 01:48:12.836]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:48:12.856 --> 01:48:13.456]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:48:13.476 --> 01:48:14.077]  We appreciate it.
[01:48:14.097 --> 01:48:14.877]  Keep it up.
[01:48:14.917 --> 01:48:15.138]  Alright.
[01:48:15.158 --> 01:48:15.398]  Right on.
[01:48:21.977 --> 01:48:23.717]  Well, hell yeah!
[01:48:24.258 --> 01:48:27.118]  Biggs, you might run into a group called Freedom's Phoenix.
[01:48:27.138 --> 01:48:29.279]  There's a lot of good guys out there.
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:37.781]  Ernest Hancock, 4409, is a good activist out there.
[01:48:37.801 --> 01:48:39.482]  He does some amazing videos.
[01:48:40.162 --> 01:48:42.763]  I wonder if those guys will be out there at this event.
[01:48:44.985 --> 01:48:46.207]  Phoenix is a hotbed of people.
[01:48:46.487 --> 01:48:47.449]  I've been there a couple times.
[01:48:47.489 --> 01:48:51.594]  It's a hotbed of people who are into being free and living free.
[01:48:52.396 --> 01:48:58.525]  And, you know, when the truth comes out that, hey, these guys are at a mosque in your backyard,
[01:49:00.306 --> 01:49:01.587]  I agree with what they're doing out here.
[01:49:01.627 --> 01:49:04.228]  Coming out and just stating, hey, we know what's going on.
[01:49:04.528 --> 01:49:07.630]  If you're going to be a terrorist factory, we're going to have a problem with that.
[01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:16.934]  We didn't have a problem with you before when you were doing your Muslim thing, praying, keeping to yourselves, or just not going out and provoking.
[01:49:17.955 --> 01:49:22.797]  But if you're creating shooters who are going out and attacking people, well, now there's a problem.
[01:49:23.638 --> 01:49:28.560]  Now we need to man up and show up and just let people know that we're not going to take it.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.682]  So what do you think is the right position to take?
[01:49:30.702 --> 01:49:44.495]  Because I know there are some peaceful protesters in the crowd who are trying to bring everyone kind of together and don't want this thing to get out of hand because obviously if someone rushes the line with a knife, it could get a lot worse.
[01:49:44.515 --> 01:49:48.138]  That's not going to be good there tonight.
[01:49:48.258 --> 01:49:49.219]  But I mean, what do you think?
[01:49:50.322 --> 01:49:59.465]  Personally, I like it when people come out in a crowd and voice their opinions, and then you find out who really wants to talk and who really isn't interested in talking.
[01:49:59.665 --> 01:50:04.067]  Right now it looks like, you know, people holding American flags, holding signs.
[01:50:04.867 --> 01:50:06.888]  They're just saying, hey, not in my backyard.
[01:50:06.928 --> 01:50:10.829]  You're not going to become a terrorist breeding ground in my backyard.
[01:50:11.368 --> 01:50:17.354]  Right, well, I guess... I mean, they obviously didn't have a problem with them building their Islamic community center right there because it's built, it's pretty big.
[01:50:17.694 --> 01:50:17.935]  Right.
[01:50:17.955 --> 01:50:19.776]  It takes up at least half a block, that whole section.
[01:50:19.796 --> 01:50:25.422]  Yeah, it's right there by the university and federal buildings and everything like that.
[01:50:26.503 --> 01:50:47.459]  So the gentleman that Biggs was speaking with initially really powerful stuff that he was saying there and like that it's a cartoon you know it's a drawing on paper and that was you know worth someone losing their life over and if we bow down to that then you know what are we and that's kind of exactly what happened in DC they had
[01:50:48.980 --> 01:50:57.667]  They were wanting to put up posters for this Mohammed drawing contest and rather than do that, they just stopped for the next six months.
[01:50:57.967 --> 01:51:00.869]  Any PSAs or anything like this that would be kind of provocative.
[01:51:00.889 --> 01:51:02.070]  They just shut it all down.
[01:51:02.611 --> 01:51:12.158]  No signs there in the DC Metro because they didn't want this particular event or the Mohammed cartoon or whatever to go up in the Metro DC there.
[01:51:12.598 --> 01:51:17.322]  Now, as the Metro Authority, were they just thinking, okay,
[01:51:18.444 --> 01:51:21.147]  You know, this is going to be a target.
[01:51:21.807 --> 01:51:23.629]  Someone's going to come blow up the tunnel.
[01:51:23.729 --> 01:51:24.950]  But then there's the thing.
[01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:26.552]  Now we're... Exactly.
[01:51:26.712 --> 01:51:27.413]  We have to censor ourselves.
[01:51:27.433 --> 01:51:34.880]  Because of a cartoon, we are not going to let advertisers or PSAs or things go up because we don't want to get bombed.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:36.201]  This is America.
[01:51:37.282 --> 01:51:40.904]  And it's like you said, when you, you know, this is close to a university.
[01:51:40.924 --> 01:51:43.306]  You look at the universities around the country.
[01:51:43.346 --> 01:51:46.027]  They're all playing this free speech zone game.
[01:51:46.067 --> 01:51:47.748]  We have to approve what you're going to say.
[01:51:48.108 --> 01:51:49.469]  We have to see what you're going to do.
[01:51:49.849 --> 01:51:50.770]  You have to have a permit.
[01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:52.031]  You have to go into a zone.
[01:51:52.591 --> 01:51:54.432]  And that's not what this country is all about.
[01:51:54.492 --> 01:51:57.894]  This country is about people expressing themselves and expressing their ideas.
[01:51:57.974 --> 01:52:01.796]  As long as your ideas and actions don't interfere with anyone else's.
[01:52:02.176 --> 01:52:04.158]  Although, there's a lot of spots where we've taken that away.
[01:52:05.319 --> 01:52:09.383]  Especially when you look at, you know, the way people want to medicate themselves in this country.
[01:52:09.423 --> 01:52:11.886]  They're only allowed to do it the big pharma way.
[01:52:12.106 --> 01:52:14.850]  It's the only possible way you could actually heal yourself.
[01:52:14.890 --> 01:52:18.374]  Any other way is wrong or you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:52:18.394 --> 01:52:22.699]  But, you know, when you get to the self-censorship level, this is how the terrorists win.
[01:52:23.059 --> 01:52:23.259]  Right.
[01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:24.360]  This is it.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:32.185]  When people don't say anything, when people are afraid to speak out, when people get censored from putting... We're going to get rid of all PSAs.
[01:52:32.925 --> 01:52:34.326]  Now we're going to punish everybody.
[01:52:34.546 --> 01:52:34.766]  Right.
[01:52:35.106 --> 01:52:42.030]  No one can say anything because we don't want anyone to be offended because those people tend to go and chop people's heads off.
[01:52:42.450 --> 01:52:45.692]  And all this is done by our government creating terror groups.
[01:52:46.312 --> 01:52:48.013]  They created Al-Qaeda in the 80s.
[01:52:48.454 --> 01:52:50.535]  We're having all these problems now because of Al-Qaeda in the 80s.
[01:52:51.235 --> 01:52:51.415]  Right.
[01:52:51.535 --> 01:52:51.895]  That's it.
[01:52:52.476 --> 01:53:04.463]  And we're still continuing, even though we've seen what Osama bin Laden turned into and all of that, we're still continuing to arm and fund and train the rebels now, thinking they're not going to turn around and be the same thing ten years down the line.
[01:53:04.543 --> 01:53:08.185]  And it's our open worship of Saudi Arabia and their regime there.
[01:53:08.225 --> 01:53:09.766]  We don't condemn them for doing anything.
[01:53:10.046 --> 01:53:12.008]  So they become a breeding ground for terrorists.
[01:53:12.248 --> 01:53:13.088]  And that's where you look.
[01:53:13.409 --> 01:53:14.929]  Most of the hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.
[01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:16.270]  They didn't come from Afghanistan.
[01:53:16.690 --> 01:53:17.631]  They didn't come from Syria.
[01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:18.872]  I think maybe one did.
[01:53:19.929 --> 01:53:22.412]  But most of them came from Saudi Arabia.
[01:53:22.432 --> 01:53:22.872]  Right.
[01:53:23.313 --> 01:53:24.634]  No invasion of Saudi Arabia.
[01:53:24.654 --> 01:53:28.498]  It was Iraq, who didn't even have anything to do with it.
[01:53:28.538 --> 01:53:30.380]  Oh, we just happened to have bases on Saudi Arabia.
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:32.362]  Oh, we helped them out in the first Gulf War.
[01:53:33.971 --> 01:53:38.492]  Alright, so I'm getting word now that we're going to go ahead and take a quick commercial break.
[01:53:38.892 --> 01:53:42.593]  We'll go right back to the live coverage if anything happens there.
[01:53:42.673 --> 01:53:43.493]  We'll be on standby.
[01:53:43.593 --> 01:53:47.174]  And hey, why don't you guys pull up, I think John Bowne did a second report today.
[01:53:47.214 --> 01:53:49.274]  You got a description of that right there.
[01:53:50.315 --> 01:53:51.595]  It's about what Obama's doing.
[01:53:51.675 --> 01:53:53.415]  Court battle for the illegals.
[01:53:53.635 --> 01:53:56.276]  Obama must destroy middle class America.
[01:53:56.784 --> 01:53:56.964]  Right.
[01:53:57.565 --> 01:54:04.389]  Instead of rising the tide and making prosperity happen everywhere, we're going to lower the dock level down to the least common denominator.
[01:54:04.429 --> 01:54:12.174]  So we're all wallowing in filth and scum going, please just give us our digital soup line card so we can eat.
[01:54:12.554 --> 01:54:15.136]  That's where the policies of this country are going.
[01:54:15.156 --> 01:54:15.857]  They're not for
[01:54:16.497 --> 01:54:18.439]  Freedom and individuality and prosperity.
[01:54:18.519 --> 01:54:20.380]  It's going in the complete opposite direction.
[01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:23.823]  It's to drag us down with the rest of the third world instead of getting the third world out of that.
[01:54:23.843 --> 01:54:24.583]  Because we can do it.
[01:54:24.603 --> 01:54:25.244]  We have technology.
[01:54:25.284 --> 01:54:25.664]  Oh yeah.
[01:54:25.704 --> 01:54:26.144]  Worldwide.
[01:54:26.525 --> 01:54:32.449]  Everybody could be in a... We could make easily a paradise in this world if we just started changing.
[01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:34.171]  We don't let bankers run everything.
[01:54:34.211 --> 01:54:34.711]  That's the problem.
[01:54:34.751 --> 01:54:38.834]  If the people that Rex Jones interviewed would just start caring.
[01:54:38.874 --> 01:54:39.675]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:39.695 --> 01:54:40.996]  And I'd be like, what's a TPP?
[01:54:41.176 --> 01:54:42.437]  Is that toilet paper?
[01:54:43.037 --> 01:54:45.659]  Might as well be because it's flushing the country down the toilet.
[01:54:45.679 --> 01:54:48.882]  And that was Rex Jones' first outing with a microphone talking to people.
[01:54:49.162 --> 01:54:50.563]  The guy did a masterful job.
[01:54:51.604 --> 01:54:54.666]  So yeah, let's go to Bounds Report, maybe we'll play a couple ads.
[01:54:55.186 --> 01:55:05.034]  I encourage people out there, if you're watching this right now on YouTube or on InfoWars.com forward slash show, we always appreciate our PrisonPlanet.tv members who are big supporters of us.

[01:55:16.378 --> 01:55:21.240]  So we're going to reconnect with Joe Biggs here after this short break and see what else is going on in Phoenix.
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:25.942]  We thank you for joining us for this live coverage here on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:55:26.002 --> 01:55:26.782]  We're what?
[01:55:27.683 --> 01:55:28.703]  Two hours in right now.
[01:55:29.183 --> 01:55:29.463]  Wow.
[01:55:29.703 --> 01:55:30.244]  There you go.
[01:55:30.284 --> 01:55:31.264]  So we'll be right back after this.
[01:55:36.653 --> 01:55:37.934]  I've said this consistently.
[01:55:39.936 --> 01:55:43.379]  My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to carry out the laws.
[01:55:43.499 --> 01:55:44.701]  What I'm not going to do is just wait.
[01:55:45.822 --> 01:55:59.154]  I think it's fair to say that I've shown a lot of patience, tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and I'm going to keep on doing so, but in the meantime,
[01:56:00.716 --> 01:56:04.920]  Let's figure out what we can do lawfully through executive action.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:09.103]  What about what's in the interest of the American people?
[01:56:10.124 --> 01:56:12.106]  America is not an oligarchy.
[01:56:12.946 --> 01:56:18.731]  The masters of the universe, they don't get to meet at the White House and decide how to run this country.
[01:56:19.144 --> 01:56:27.788]  President Obama's legacy of bulldozing the Constitution with an executive branch arrogance unparalleled in American history has hit another snag.
[01:56:28.428 --> 01:56:37.672]  The judicial branch has yet again foiled the globalist-engineered subversive dilution of what remains of America's receding middle class.
[01:56:38.132 --> 01:56:43.955]  As 53% of Democrats are chomping at the bit to get illegals voting according to a recent Rasmussen poll,
[01:56:44.215 --> 01:56:46.657]  The American middle class has receded by over 10%.
[01:56:47.418 --> 01:56:59.448]  As more illegals pick up blue and white collar American jobs, jobs the liberals would have you believe are jobs Americans won't do, a lower middle class income is becoming the norm for born and raised Americans.
[01:56:59.908 --> 01:57:00.969]  Thanks for watching.
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:22.326]  Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Texas just won the executive amnesty case at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[01:57:22.506 --> 01:57:24.047]  The Constitution wins.
[01:57:24.308 --> 01:57:31.074]  Obama must now throw the Hail Mary to the Supreme Court, but that move could put his action in limbo until the end of his reign in office.
[01:57:31.374 --> 01:57:39.061]  His administration has decided to focus on the appeal of the injunction as it moves forward through the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in July.
[01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:47.723]  Ann Coulter and Jorge Ramos fiercely debated the actual census numbers concerning just how many illegals are now residing in the United States.
[01:57:48.144 --> 01:57:56.446]  Studies by award-winning journalists have put the number as high as 30 million, meaning a quarter of the Mexican population has moved to the United States.
[01:57:57.085 --> 01:58:01.348]  Do you think that people are biologically predisposed to commit crimes?
[01:58:01.388 --> 01:58:04.731]  No, I think there are cultures that are obviously deficient.
[01:58:04.751 --> 01:58:08.194]  And if they weren't deficient, you wouldn't be sitting in America interviewing me.
[01:58:08.334 --> 01:58:09.455]  I'd be sitting in Mexico.
[01:58:09.755 --> 01:58:14.399]  You fled that culture because it is a there are a lot of problems with that culture.
[01:58:14.539 --> 01:58:16.861]  When you bring the people here, you bring those cultures here.
[01:58:17.141 --> 01:58:18.542]  That includes honor killings.
[01:58:18.622 --> 01:58:21.885]  It includes uncles raping their nieces, not paying your taxes.
[01:58:21.945 --> 01:58:24.447]  It includes paying bribes to government officials.
[01:58:24.767 --> 01:58:26.008]  That isn't our culture.
[01:58:26.448 --> 01:58:37.763]  But it's particularly difficult to be effective when the administration continues to sabotage its own efforts by embracing unconstitutional policies like the president's executive action.
[01:58:37.883 --> 01:58:39.125]  I think perhaps the larger
[01:58:39.753 --> 01:58:45.038]  I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse.
[01:59:04.395 --> 01:59:13.407]  As the illegals crossing become more desperate and violent, Ramos and others like Luis Gutierrez won't rest until the entire population of Mexico is here.
[01:59:13.707 --> 01:59:19.514]  A creeping cultural imperialism that can only break the back of the almighty American dollar and dream.
[01:59:20.015 --> 01:59:22.018]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[01:59:29.446 --> 01:59:30.267]  The facts are in.
[01:59:30.467 --> 01:59:31.588]  The studies are legion.
[01:59:31.869 --> 01:59:39.216]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:59:39.396 --> 01:59:42.840]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:43.641]  Simple.
[01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:48.205]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:59:48.526 --> 01:59:51.729]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet.
[01:59:51.909 --> 01:59:53.951]  But we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:59:54.211 --> 01:59:59.597]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield formulation.
[01:59:59.757 --> 02:00:10.267]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[02:00:10.547 --> 02:00:12.409]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[02:00:12.509 --> 02:00:14.813]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[02:00:15.113 --> 02:00:16.977]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[02:00:17.277 --> 02:00:22.586]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[02:00:22.846 --> 02:00:25.571]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the...
[02:00:35.069 --> 02:00:42.232]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:00:42.332 --> 02:00:44.512]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:00:44.692 --> 02:00:49.894]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:00:50.054 --> 02:00:55.136]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:00:55.276 --> 02:00:58.398]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:00:58.678 --> 02:01:02.600]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:07.123]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:01:07.203 --> 02:01:17.349]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:01:17.549 --> 02:01:21.932]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[02:01:22.032 --> 02:01:23.993]  The new Infowars Life Lung Cleanse is

[02:02:40.752 --> 02:02:45.053]  Introducing the new InfoWarsLife.com Oil of Oregano Formulation.
[02:02:45.353 --> 02:02:53.075]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:02:53.295 --> 02:02:58.536]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[02:02:58.816 --> 02:03:04.337]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:04.737]  Yes.
[02:03:04.757 --> 02:03:13.319]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:03:13.659 --> 02:03:19.940]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:25.241]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:03:25.421 --> 02:03:28.941]  Now available in our limited first run at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:03:29.141 --> 02:03:30.161]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:03:41.041 --> 02:03:45.042]  All right, and welcome back to this live edition of the Info Wars Nightly News.
[02:03:45.062 --> 02:03:46.522]  We'll be right back with Joe Biggs.
[02:03:46.562 --> 02:03:49.363]  He's live out there in Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:03:49.863 --> 02:03:52.103]  I wanted to talk about some of your Twitter questions.
[02:03:52.163 --> 02:03:53.723]  You can send us in your questions.
[02:03:54.364 --> 02:04:02.005]  I am at Leanne McAdoo, Dews News with a Z, and there's also Liberty Terrian back there answering your questions on Twitter.
[02:04:02.425 --> 02:04:04.746]  First, I want to address Conspiracy Scope.
[02:04:04.926 --> 02:04:06.906]  I actually got the chance to meet Conspiracy Scope
[02:04:07.386 --> 02:04:09.788]  When we were covering 9-11 there in New York.
[02:04:10.208 --> 02:04:11.129]  Really great dude.
[02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:15.153]  He's like one of the original people who was putting all of our content on YouTube.
[02:04:15.193 --> 02:04:18.635]  So if you're on YouTube, be sure you follow his YouTube channel.
[02:04:19.236 --> 02:04:29.144]  But Conspiracy Scope has been wondering at what point will the people who pay for the Prison Planet subscription, when can they get a commercial-free news?
[02:04:30.305 --> 02:04:36.271]  Actually, we do put out a commercial-free podcast version, an audio version, of the show that a lot of people download.
[02:04:36.711 --> 02:04:41.315]  And that, I would say, goes up probably within 20 to 30 minutes.
[02:04:43.237 --> 02:04:44.838]  Tech guy back there, is that thumbs up?
[02:04:44.858 --> 02:04:45.499]  Is that correct?
[02:04:45.539 --> 02:04:50.223]  About 20-30 minutes after the show's done, by 2.30, we have an audio version up.
[02:04:51.304 --> 02:05:03.987]  And with video, the problem, Conspiracy Scope, is that it takes a long time to take HD video, edit it out, crunch it together, then you gotta compress it, then you gotta upload that.
[02:05:04.327 --> 02:05:09.308]  It's a lot quicker to upload an audio file than it is a video file.
[02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.809]  It's probably 50 times longer.
[02:05:12.609 --> 02:05:23.457]  And then that would be tying up a computer and we would have an editor working on that and making sure that's going up and not doing much else during the show.
[02:05:23.477 --> 02:05:26.940]  Or having to stay much longer after the show is over.
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:27.300]  Right.
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:31.223]  And what we do have is we immediately go to rebroadcast.
[02:05:31.283 --> 02:05:32.624]  So that's already going back up.
[02:05:33.886 --> 02:05:39.470]  Um, people can tune into that anytime they can skip the commercials or mute the commercials or whatever.
[02:05:40.231 --> 02:05:43.093]  Um, you know, ads are what pays the bills here.
[02:05:43.313 --> 02:05:44.254]  And yeah, I agree.
[02:05:44.694 --> 02:05:46.135]  Maybe Rob in the future.
[02:05:46.155 --> 02:05:46.636]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:05:46.916 --> 02:05:49.298]  We've got the guy who put this event together is on with bigs right now.
[02:05:49.318 --> 02:05:49.978]  We need to cut to them.
[02:05:50.098 --> 02:05:53.681]  All right, let's go to him.
[02:05:53.881 --> 02:05:55.102]  All right.
[02:05:55.122 --> 02:05:56.883]  This is the guy who put this event together.
[02:05:56.923 --> 02:05:57.664]  He's talking right now.
[02:05:58.326 --> 02:06:01.707]  And now my family is in hiding, and I'm having to go into hiding afterwards.
[02:06:01.727 --> 02:06:06.107]  Do you have any different opinion after talking to him?
[02:06:06.147 --> 02:06:06.367]  Nope.
[02:06:06.407 --> 02:06:08.408]  This is how it's been with a lot of Muslims.
[02:06:08.528 --> 02:06:13.809]  And some will still also say that, you know, they're allowed to sit there and deceive the infidel.
[02:06:13.909 --> 02:06:16.909]  But you didn't have a nice conversation?
[02:06:16.949 --> 02:06:19.650]  You didn't get a positive reaction from that conversation?
[02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:20.550]  We were peaceful.
[02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:22.090]  It was a peaceful conversation.
[02:06:22.590 --> 02:06:23.470]  I am capable.
[02:06:23.490 --> 02:06:24.191]  I am a Marine.
[02:06:24.251 --> 02:06:25.011]  I have discipline.
[02:06:25.111 --> 02:06:26.831]  I am capable to have a peaceful
[02:06:27.301 --> 02:06:28.442]  Conversation with somebody.
[02:06:28.782 --> 02:06:28.982]  Okay?
[02:06:29.022 --> 02:06:30.984]  And I have questions and I want answers.
[02:06:31.024 --> 02:06:32.585]  And that's what it came down to.
[02:06:32.785 --> 02:06:40.011]  And you brought up, you got to wear a Kevlar, you've got some guys surrounding you with guns.
[02:06:40.312 --> 02:06:41.232]  Was it worth it?
[02:06:42.253 --> 02:06:42.834]  Absolutely!
[02:06:43.074 --> 02:06:45.015]  You know, I just sacrificed myself.
[02:06:45.436 --> 02:06:46.957]  I just bought my house.
[02:06:47.497 --> 02:06:49.059]  First house I've bought in my life.
[02:06:49.379 --> 02:06:49.679]  Okay?
[02:06:49.979 --> 02:06:51.040]  Trying to raise my family out here.
[02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:52.141]  I just bought it a year ago.
[02:06:52.621 --> 02:06:53.802]  And now we're going to have to sell it.
[02:06:54.323 --> 02:06:56.865]  I just sacrificed my entire livelihood
[02:06:57.321 --> 02:07:00.867]  Just to expose what's going on in this country.
[02:07:00.887 --> 02:07:01.568]  Okay?
[02:07:01.668 --> 02:07:03.592]  Our freedom of speech is under attack.
[02:07:04.012 --> 02:07:11.265]  If you don't believe me, there's a group of people over there that think that I should be beheaded for wearing a shirt or for drawing a cartoon.
[02:07:11.912 --> 02:07:20.199]  There is also a group of people over there that are not Muslims, but they are the same type of people that spit on our Vietnam veterans when they came home.
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:23.422]  Well, there was a lot of spitting going on on this side today, too.
[02:07:23.863 --> 02:07:24.824]  And I don't condone that.
[02:07:25.064 --> 02:07:28.267]  So we'll do our part and we're going to police our own.
[02:07:28.907 --> 02:07:34.012]  This gentleman over here said they're going to practice and do their part and police their own.
[02:07:34.372 --> 02:07:35.193]  I still encourage
[02:07:35.706 --> 02:07:39.790]  Anybody in any major city to fire up your own freedom of speech rally.
[02:07:40.130 --> 02:07:45.655]  Don't call it an anti-Islam, don't let the media twist it, but a freedom of speech rally.
[02:07:45.695 --> 02:07:48.017]  I want it to happen in every state, okay?
[02:07:48.677 --> 02:07:51.219]  And I hope they all remain peaceful.
[02:07:51.499 --> 02:07:53.721]  What's planned from here on out tonight?
[02:07:54.882 --> 02:08:00.167]  I go, I hop in the truck with some fellow Americans and we disappear for a while.
[02:08:01.652 --> 02:08:06.896]  I'm going into hiding for a while.
[02:08:07.397 --> 02:08:09.018]  All right, ISIS posted my address.
[02:08:09.078 --> 02:08:10.880]  My family's already way off the radar.
[02:08:13.162 --> 02:08:14.723]  And they've called for lone wolf attacks.
[02:08:15.383 --> 02:08:20.648]  I've had a few of these individuals over here that are saying they're going to murder me and all that stuff.
[02:08:20.708 --> 02:08:21.929]  We expected it.
[02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.329]  I know.
[02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:25.432]  I knew what we were coming here to.
[02:08:25.492 --> 02:08:27.474]  And I came here and I have not once
[02:08:28.001 --> 02:08:28.642]  He fought for that.
[02:08:47.722 --> 02:08:49.002]  And get on with our lives.
[02:08:49.402 --> 02:08:50.763]  One final question, sorry.
[02:08:50.803 --> 02:08:55.843]  So there's a lot of police resources used up today, a lot of heated back and forth.
[02:08:56.384 --> 02:08:58.404]  Is it really worth it to make this point?
[02:08:58.844 --> 02:09:00.944]  I didn't call for the police forces to be out here.
[02:09:01.064 --> 02:09:04.825]  They're out here because, uh, let me also say this.
[02:09:04.885 --> 02:09:06.365]  May 17th, we were out here.
[02:09:06.385 --> 02:09:09.726]  We were out here fully armed.
[02:09:10.106 --> 02:09:15.067]  We came out here a few hours, voiced our opinion, held our protest.
[02:09:15.127 --> 02:09:15.907]  Everything was peaceful.
[02:09:16.445 --> 02:09:18.046]  There was a handful of cops.
[02:09:18.426 --> 02:09:19.927]  Everybody was courteous.
[02:09:19.947 --> 02:09:21.868]  There was nothing rude.
[02:09:21.908 --> 02:09:23.829]  We weren't throwing pig meat or nothing like that.
[02:09:23.849 --> 02:09:26.811]  And we all went home that night.
[02:09:27.351 --> 02:09:31.553]  Now, today, a lot of police resources, potentially some bad blood.
[02:09:31.593 --> 02:09:32.214]  Was it worth it?
[02:09:33.074 --> 02:09:33.935]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:09:34.195 --> 02:09:42.159]  Again, this has to be done just to show Americans and the rest of the world that our freedom of speech is under attack.
[02:09:44.119 --> 02:09:46.621]  Obviously corporate controlled media wouldn't understand that.
[02:09:46.661 --> 02:09:47.842]  Thank you for your service.
[02:09:47.882 --> 02:09:49.563]  Talk to him, Biggs.
[02:09:49.863 --> 02:09:50.884]  Tell him he's live right now.
[02:09:50.924 --> 02:09:52.545]  This guy's got a button on his backpack.
[02:09:52.565 --> 02:09:53.746]  Hey, I'll shake your hand.
[02:09:53.766 --> 02:09:54.106]  I don't agree.
[02:10:12.341 --> 02:10:13.122]  Hey Biggs.
[02:10:13.402 --> 02:10:15.565]  Wow.
[02:10:15.585 --> 02:10:19.689]  Yeah, I knew that would be out there.
[02:10:20.530 --> 02:10:21.091]  So Biggs.
[02:10:21.851 --> 02:10:21.972]  Yeah.
[02:10:21.992 --> 02:10:22.492]  Can you hear me?
[02:10:22.852 --> 02:10:27.277]  So ask him, you know, he fought for those people there to have their right.
[02:10:28.118 --> 02:10:28.858]  To free speech.
[02:10:29.099 --> 02:10:31.440]  For their right to be offended with him.
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:37.363]  Their right to have their religion there in the middle of Phoenix.
[02:10:37.743 --> 02:10:43.326]  They might not agree with each other, but he fought for our rights to have the freedom of speech.
[02:10:45.802 --> 02:10:51.984]  I mean, if you could even just talk to him about that, because the mainstream media guy that was talking to him was like, well, was it worth it?
[02:10:52.364 --> 02:10:57.946]  I think when he signed up to join, to be a Marine, it was worth it to fight for this country.
[02:10:59.126 --> 02:11:00.667]  This used to be a Christian church.
[02:11:01.307 --> 02:11:03.047]  They bought it and they put it down.
[02:11:03.087 --> 02:11:03.307]  Sure.
[02:11:04.548 --> 02:11:14.391]  So how does it feel, you know, fighting for your country like I did as well, and then you fought for the right to give people the ability to go out and do stuff like this, and then to be attacked
[02:11:15.089 --> 02:11:15.809]  It's sad, man.
[02:11:16.049 --> 02:11:17.210]  Lady Liberty is crying.
[02:11:17.230 --> 02:11:19.951]  This is ridiculous.
[02:11:20.631 --> 02:11:21.831]  I did fight for my country.
[02:11:21.871 --> 02:11:23.332]  I went to Iraq twice myself.
[02:11:25.392 --> 02:11:30.434]  Although I may not agree with everything that was going on with the war, I still rogered up to the call of duty.
[02:11:31.554 --> 02:11:33.215]  This isn't the country that I want.
[02:11:33.255 --> 02:11:35.255]  This isn't the country that our founding fathers wanted.
[02:11:35.275 --> 02:11:39.116]  This is tyranny, right on the other side of that wire right there.
[02:11:39.417 --> 02:11:40.737]  That's tyranny at its finest.
[02:11:41.077 --> 02:11:41.957]  They want to shut us up.
[02:11:43.058 --> 02:11:44.098]  They think it's okay for
[02:11:44.488 --> 02:11:48.230]  Someone like me to be beheaded because I'm wearing a shirt or drawing a cartoon.
[02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:58.074]  And unfortunately, yeah, I had to sacrifice my own livelihood here in Arizona that I just started a year ago, all to expose what's going on in our country.
[02:11:58.474 --> 02:11:58.734]  Wow.
[02:11:59.355 --> 02:12:02.396]  How does he feel about the fact the mainstream media wants him to be silent?
[02:12:02.736 --> 02:12:04.297]  The mainstream media is saying, well, why don't
[02:12:06.704 --> 02:12:07.405]  Was it worth it?
[02:12:07.425 --> 02:12:08.588]  Wanting me to be silent?
[02:12:09.008 --> 02:12:11.814]  Asking you if it was worth it.
[02:12:12.275 --> 02:12:13.276]  That's Anderson Cooper.
[02:12:13.517 --> 02:12:14.419]  Fuck Anderson Cooper.
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:16.603]  Maybe that'll be my next shirt.
[02:12:16.783 --> 02:12:17.765]  Fuck Anderson Cooper.
[02:12:17.905 --> 02:12:18.987]  I'm sure he wants to behead me.
[02:12:20.691 --> 02:12:20.991]  Yeah.
[02:12:21.471 --> 02:12:23.732]  Well, they consistently ask, was it worth it?
[02:12:23.812 --> 02:12:26.153]  I mean, was it worth it to go fight the war?
[02:12:26.213 --> 02:12:27.753]  Was it worth it there?
[02:12:27.893 --> 02:12:31.695]  Everything that, I mean, that's where, that's what we've come to.
[02:12:31.715 --> 02:12:32.315]  It's amazing.
[02:12:32.355 --> 02:12:39.397]  Was it worth it to fight against this tyranny, to fight against these other people who are coming here to fundamentally change our country?
[02:12:40.138 --> 02:12:40.818]  Was it worth it?
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:46.384]  You know, what's interesting, I've been to Detroit and they have Dearborn, Michigan's right outside of Detroit.
[02:12:46.484 --> 02:12:48.566]  And that is a huge Muslim community.
[02:12:49.367 --> 02:12:50.729]  And those people are there.
[02:12:50.749 --> 02:12:53.852]  They haven't assimilated into the American lifestyle.
[02:12:53.872 --> 02:12:55.994]  They've bought churches and turned them into mosques.
[02:12:56.534 --> 02:12:57.375]  I heard somebody say that.
[02:12:57.415 --> 02:12:59.757]  That used to be a Christian church and they turned it into a mosque.
[02:13:00.578 --> 02:13:05.780]  And that stuff is going to happen when you do have large influxes of people moving in.
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:08.581]  But we still have our rights.
[02:13:08.641 --> 02:13:12.282]  It's like, just because you move in, you can't dictate how we're going to live.
[02:13:12.462 --> 02:13:12.682]  Right.
[02:13:12.782 --> 02:13:17.684]  And David Knight came in here during the break and said he wanted to say something about free speech, and I think this is a good spot.
[02:13:17.724 --> 02:13:26.467]  David, why don't you pop in and talk about free speech, because you've got not a different view on free speech, but just a different view on what's going on in general.
[02:13:26.627 --> 02:13:27.487]  Why don't you pop in?
[02:13:27.927 --> 02:13:28.607]  Yeah, in general.
[02:13:29.048 --> 02:13:33.509]  I've watched Pamela Gellar, and frankly, I don't like her personally.
[02:13:33.529 --> 02:13:41.853]  I don't like the fact that she's trolling Muslims any more than I like the fact that you've got the Westboro Baptists that are going out there protesting military people's funerals.
[02:13:42.353 --> 02:13:50.657]  I find that kind of speech repulsive, but even though it is hate speech, it is protected under the First Amendment.
[02:13:51.357 --> 02:13:58.261]  And I think it's very important that we not allow the First Amendment to be destroyed by vilification, by hate speech laws.
[02:13:58.301 --> 02:14:02.964]  We need to protect speech we disagree with, speech that's even hateful.
[02:14:03.084 --> 02:14:08.308]  We need to support that because it's important to support that as a principle.
[02:14:08.968 --> 02:14:17.258]  I think it's important to understand that the very same First Amendment that gives Muslims and Christians freedom of religion also protects free speech.
[02:14:17.898 --> 02:14:20.041]  And how do we determine these freedoms?
[02:14:20.081 --> 02:14:23.144]  Well, your freedom ends with my nose, as we say, right?
[02:14:23.184 --> 02:14:26.668]  When your freedom starts spilling over into my life, when you start making demands on me,
[02:14:27.409 --> 02:14:30.250]  Then, you know, it's no longer your personal liberty.
[02:14:30.290 --> 02:14:42.613]  And so, I understand that Pamela Geller is making a point about a large percentage, perhaps, certainly the ones that we see, maybe, I don't know what percentage of Muslims they represent.
[02:14:43.153 --> 02:14:47.934]  But we see plenty of people who are Muslims who want to kill people.
[02:14:48.334 --> 02:14:49.796]  For exercising their free speech.
[02:14:49.896 --> 02:14:52.458]  So, I understand how they feel.
[02:14:52.578 --> 02:14:56.942]  It annoys me to see family guy doing cartoons making fun of Jesus.
[02:14:57.023 --> 02:14:58.224]  That really annoys me.
[02:14:58.404 --> 02:15:04.390]  I don't want to go out there and kill people because I understand where the First Amendment falls.
[02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:05.431]  I understand freedom of speech.
[02:15:05.451 --> 02:15:06.592]  I understand freedom of religion.
[02:15:06.992 --> 02:15:09.615]  I don't like to be forced as a taxpayer
[02:15:10.996 --> 02:15:15.879]  to pay for Andre Serranos putting a crucifix of Jesus in a vat of urine.
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:17.160]  I don't think that's art.
[02:15:17.380 --> 02:15:18.401]  I think that's hateful.
[02:15:18.641 --> 02:15:19.802]  I don't like to pay for that.
[02:15:20.022 --> 02:15:22.023]  I think we ought to stop paying for that type of thing.
[02:15:22.204 --> 02:15:23.705]  But I don't think you ought to be put in prison.
[02:15:24.085 --> 02:15:25.206]  I don't think you ought to be killed.
[02:15:25.646 --> 02:15:38.034]  And I think that's the point that you just saw the veteran who had organized this make, is that now he's under a death threat from this radical sect of Islam.
[02:15:38.094 --> 02:15:40.576]  If Islam wants to coexist here in America,
[02:15:41.236 --> 02:15:50.544]  They need to verbally take the lead in putting down the people who are getting violent against other people who cannot tolerate free speech.
[02:15:50.845 --> 02:16:00.293]  But I think it's just as important that we push back against the violations of free speech in the name of protecting people from feeling bad, in the name of shutting down hate speech.
[02:16:00.353 --> 02:16:06.358]  I think it's just as important that we push back on that in the universities, in the media, everywhere else where that's coming up.
[02:16:06.698 --> 02:16:10.840]  Right, the media guy's trying to shame the veteran there saying, do you think it's worth it?
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:11.640]  Do you think it's worth it?
[02:16:13.961 --> 02:16:16.643]  These people aren't saying Muslims go back to the Middle East.
[02:16:16.663 --> 02:16:18.363]  They're not saying, get out of my country.
[02:16:18.623 --> 02:16:25.967]  They're saying, look, we're allowed to show a cartoon image of your creator or your prophet.
[02:16:26.827 --> 02:16:27.127]  Okay.
[02:16:27.468 --> 02:16:28.588]  We're allowed to do that.
[02:16:28.969 --> 02:16:32.911]  Whether you like it or not, because you're allowed to say things that we don't like either.
[02:16:32.931 --> 02:16:33.772]  And that's the way it works.
[02:16:33.792 --> 02:16:36.754]  And what it is is hateful, but until they can... And he fought for them to have that right.
[02:16:37.074 --> 02:16:37.515]  Exactly.
[02:16:37.595 --> 02:16:40.116]  What they're doing, we can say at one level, is hateful.
[02:16:40.157 --> 02:16:41.658]  What Pamela Geller is doing is hateful.
[02:16:42.418 --> 02:16:49.808]  Until they can accept that and tolerate hateful attacks, then they need to be confronted.
[02:16:50.109 --> 02:16:52.252]  And I really do appreciate him putting his life on the line.
[02:16:52.452 --> 02:16:57.739]  But we need to confront people who will take away our basic fundamental freedoms.
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:00.101]  That we possess as human beings.
[02:17:00.161 --> 02:17:01.682]  Those are things worth fighting for.
[02:17:01.942 --> 02:17:03.303]  Those are things worth dying for.
[02:17:03.564 --> 02:17:07.306]  Those are even things worth going over the edge and being hateful about.
[02:17:07.446 --> 02:17:10.788]  To say, you're going to kill people because of their free speech exercise?
[02:17:10.808 --> 02:17:11.289]  Then fine.
[02:17:11.729 --> 02:17:13.450]  Let me illustrate that for you.
[02:17:13.470 --> 02:17:15.492]  I understand what Pamela Gellar is doing.
[02:17:16.112 --> 02:17:16.772]  I don't like it.
[02:17:16.892 --> 02:17:19.134]  I don't like it when it's done to me as a Christian.
[02:17:19.474 --> 02:17:21.395]  But I certainly understand the point that they're making.
[02:17:21.556 --> 02:17:22.576]  And it's an important point.
[02:17:22.596 --> 02:17:27.880]  We cannot allow free speech, freedom of religion to be shut down on the basis of hate speech.
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:37.802]  Understand, too, that we have the same thing is being done to Christians in terms of marriage and in terms of other religious aspects that they wish to exercise.
[02:17:38.082 --> 02:17:42.724]  And so this is a full spectrum that we need to understand where the boundaries are.
[02:17:42.784 --> 02:17:48.205]  We need to understand when you're coercing other people and when you're just exercising your free speech.
[02:17:48.325 --> 02:17:51.686]  I got two points to make here from a couple of Twitter followers.
[02:17:51.826 --> 02:17:53.167]  Loose Screw has a question.
[02:17:53.187 --> 02:17:57.989]  He says, do you think the straw that breaks the camel's back will be the financial collapse or religious riots?
[02:17:59.049 --> 02:18:09.854]  I think it'll be a combination of both, but I think the financial collapse is going to kick off anything major, aside from these hot pockets of protests that we're seeing around the country right now.
[02:18:10.214 --> 02:18:13.295]  I don't think you're going to see anything widespread until there is a financial collapse.
[02:18:13.395 --> 02:18:21.716]  And then David Absolute says, Christians assisting in peaceful protests would not spit on the Vietnam vets just to clear that up.
[02:18:22.416 --> 02:18:23.997]  And I would agree with him.
[02:18:24.017 --> 02:18:25.157]  I don't think you're going to see that.
[02:18:26.257 --> 02:18:28.517]  What do we consider the Westboro Baptist Church?
[02:18:29.177 --> 02:18:30.818]  Are those guys, what do they consider themselves?
[02:18:30.938 --> 02:18:32.158]  They call themselves Christian.
[02:18:32.178 --> 02:18:35.779]  Most people who call themselves Christian would not consider them to be Christian.
[02:18:35.799 --> 02:18:36.559]  A weird inborn sect.
[02:18:38.019 --> 02:18:40.480]  Yeah, I really don't understand where those guys are coming from.
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:48.002]  I've heard what they say, but it doesn't look anything like what I see Jesus doing, quite frankly.
[02:18:48.583 --> 02:18:48.803]  Right.
[02:18:49.103 --> 02:18:51.303]  Doesn't look like Jesus, so it doesn't look like Christianity to me.
[02:18:51.583 --> 02:18:58.286]  Yeah, and so we see people there with the blue signs across the way, and some are saying like, you know, F.
[02:18:59.722 --> 02:19:00.183]  I don't
[02:19:17.455 --> 02:19:22.298]  People who are in this country, who are against that, and that's exactly what happened in Waco.
[02:19:22.318 --> 02:19:30.122]  They have one of the largest groups of Islamic mosques there, spoke out about that and said, we absolutely disagree with what happened.
[02:19:30.142 --> 02:19:31.062]  We're not for that.
[02:19:31.462 --> 02:19:33.343]  If they want to draw the cartoons, who cares?
[02:19:33.423 --> 02:19:34.024]  Like, whatever.
[02:19:34.564 --> 02:19:36.325]  And so that's what we need to see more of.
[02:19:37.165 --> 02:19:41.928]  But a lot of people there are just kind of saying, you know, that you're just attacking this entire
[02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:50.994]  religion of people here but that's not the case and that's kind of the excuse that's being used throughout the media to just demand passivity.
[02:19:51.014 --> 02:19:52.275]  Don't offend!
[02:19:53.155 --> 02:20:04.541]  We can't let a vocal minority, whether it's a Westboro Baptist or whether it's a radical Muslims, we can't allow a vocal minority to destroy our freedoms and so they have to be confronted.
[02:20:04.681 --> 02:20:09.984]  Both groups have to be confronted and it really is something that's necessary and of course
[02:20:10.564 --> 02:20:17.712]  I, personally looking at this, I can't tell whether they are a small minority or a large minority or the majority, quite frankly.
[02:20:17.772 --> 02:20:26.401]  I think the Muslims need to take the lead in terms of opposing these violent people, but they need to be challenged, not cowed down to.
[02:20:26.681 --> 02:20:28.042]  Right, because then it only builds.
[02:20:28.322 --> 02:20:30.263]  Then they think, oh, well now we can get you on anything.
[02:20:30.503 --> 02:20:31.844]  Marco, just a quick production note.
[02:20:31.884 --> 02:20:36.027]  People do want to see what's going on in the protest, so keep this split screen up like you have.
[02:20:36.627 --> 02:20:42.431]  People, I've seen a couple tweets already of people watching that, and you can send us your Twitter questions.
[02:20:42.591 --> 02:20:47.014]  I'm at dewsnews, we've got at Leanne McAdoo, and at Liberty Terrien.
[02:20:47.994 --> 02:20:50.375]  And you're watching, this is the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:20:50.435 --> 02:21:01.640]  We're almost into two and a half hours of live coverage on this Friday where, you know, we could be out enjoying our Friday evening with our families, but we're here with you getting the word out.
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:05.202]  This is kind of a story that really just started bubbling up this morning.
[02:21:06.062 --> 02:21:09.626]  Um, over in, uh, in Phoenix, Arizona with this protest.
[02:21:09.646 --> 02:21:12.388]  I guess it's been planned for a couple weeks now, but it really, it hit the media.
[02:21:12.408 --> 02:21:14.991]  Well, he was on Anderson Cooper, I think, yesterday or something.
[02:21:15.031 --> 02:21:19.896]  But that's, that's how they want to, they really want to just point out how these people are hateful, hateful.
[02:21:20.076 --> 02:21:20.316]  Right.
[02:21:20.536 --> 02:21:24.260]  And, you know, they're being racist or, you know, bigots and whatever.
[02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:26.342]  And it's, it's not that.
[02:21:26.402 --> 02:21:30.046]  I mean, yeah, obviously some people probably are out there with that paradigm.
[02:21:30.546 --> 02:21:32.988]  But it is kind of saying, this is America.
[02:21:33.168 --> 02:21:42.016]  If we want to be able to put up posters in the metro authority, we don't need to be afraid that it's going to be bombed.
[02:21:42.497 --> 02:21:42.677]  Yeah.
[02:21:43.277 --> 02:21:44.959]  I mean, that that's insane.
[02:21:45.486 --> 02:21:47.447]  Let me just repeat what somebody tweeted to me.
[02:21:47.507 --> 02:21:50.188]  He said, the most important speech is that which offends.
[02:21:50.388 --> 02:21:51.329]  That is absolutely true.
[02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:52.349]  That's from James Knox.
[02:21:53.089 --> 02:21:54.010]  That's absolutely true.
[02:21:54.470 --> 02:21:58.912]  If you're going to bow down on the speech that offends, then you don't have free speech.
[02:21:59.172 --> 02:21:59.852]  That's the whole point.
[02:22:00.072 --> 02:22:05.535]  That's why Voltaire said, I may disagree with what you have to say, but I will defend it to my death.
[02:22:06.195 --> 02:22:11.340]  Because that is the essence of the principle of free speech, the principle of freedom of religion.
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:22.290]  I may totally disagree with them, and I do disagree with them religiously, but I will say they have a right to worship the way that they want to, unless that worship includes cutting people's heads off.
[02:22:22.510 --> 02:22:23.651]  We're not going to accept that.
[02:22:23.991 --> 02:22:26.254]  Well, I think the guy has it right there on that sign.
[02:22:26.274 --> 02:22:28.396]  He who does not love does not know God.
[02:22:28.777 --> 02:22:29.397]  And here's another one.
[02:22:29.437 --> 02:22:31.019]  Love the Muslims, hate evil.
[02:22:32.040 --> 02:22:33.662]  And that's what we have to get.
[02:22:33.722 --> 02:22:35.024]  We can live together.
[02:22:35.444 --> 02:22:37.086]  Christians and Muslims can live together.
[02:22:37.326 --> 02:22:38.208]  We can prosper together.
[02:22:38.228 --> 02:22:39.609]  They've been doing it for centuries.
[02:22:40.470 --> 02:22:49.152]  And you know they did it before we invaded in the Middle East and now all the Christian churches in Iraq and Afghanistan have been destroyed because of American foreign policy.
[02:22:49.472 --> 02:22:50.932]  We poisoned that well.
[02:22:51.012 --> 02:22:52.672]  We were the aggressor in that case.
[02:22:53.233 --> 02:22:53.533]  Okay?
[02:22:53.773 --> 02:23:03.675]  And so that's brought about a religious persecution and backlash against Christians in those Islamic countries that was not there for thousands of years until the U.S.
[02:23:03.715 --> 02:23:05.455]  military-industrial complex went there.
[02:23:05.615 --> 02:23:16.227]  And yes, liberals, we can thank Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and the Bush clan for that, for definitely instituting that, because before, I guess you can thank Zbigniew Brzezinski, too, for helping create Al-Qaeda.
[02:23:16.947 --> 02:23:26.117]  And, I mean, there's a whole list of technocrats and evil people that we sometimes vote into office, sometimes they just take, assume the office.
[02:23:26.958 --> 02:23:28.199]  Um, in our governments.
[02:23:28.559 --> 02:23:33.982]  And, you know, right now, what it looks like, I'm really impressed that it's been peaceful on both sides.
[02:23:34.002 --> 02:23:36.123]  Yeah, you're going to have words, but that's fine.
[02:23:36.523 --> 02:23:37.503]  Words can never hurt me.
[02:23:38.084 --> 02:23:38.464]  Right.
[02:23:38.484 --> 02:23:40.064]  Sticks and stones break my bones.
[02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:40.825]  Exactly.
[02:23:40.845 --> 02:23:42.346]  Change the channel if you don't like it.
[02:23:42.366 --> 02:23:47.968]  The cartoon, believe it or not, is really not going to offend your God if he is your God.
[02:23:48.048 --> 02:23:49.469]  I mean, it's a cartoon.
[02:23:49.669 --> 02:23:52.250]  If you don't like driving in front of the mosque, don't go down that street.
[02:23:52.350 --> 02:23:54.151]  You know, there's a million streets in America.
[02:23:54.191 --> 02:23:55.352]  They don't all have mosques in them.
[02:23:56.775 --> 02:24:09.903]  So, you know, right now what you're seeing, this looks like the private property where, I don't know if it's the Muslim, if the religion owns this or what or who owns it, but they seem to be coming over and they're talking with people now.
[02:24:10.303 --> 02:24:11.564]  This is what has to happen.
[02:24:11.624 --> 02:24:13.365]  This is the dialogue that
[02:24:14.125 --> 02:24:19.652]  You know, you hear all this cussing and signs and stuff, but this is the good side, right here, that you probably won't see on the mainstream media.
[02:24:19.732 --> 02:24:23.076]  Right, you're gonna just see the guns and the, you know, these people came out here.
[02:24:23.096 --> 02:24:24.738]  I know, people were carrying guns.
[02:24:24.758 --> 02:24:27.201]  They're frightening and terrorists and they're just harassing.
[02:24:27.662 --> 02:24:31.146]  But, see, the gentleman that was interviewed at the very beginning brought up a
[02:24:31.807 --> 02:24:32.648]  A good point.
[02:24:32.768 --> 02:24:51.658]  I mean, if there are now four people coming out of this particular mosque, I mean, I don't want to say that this mosque is breeding jihadists or anything like that, but a person who goes to that mosque, who is a member of that community, you have to be able to step outside of your, you know,
[02:24:52.799 --> 02:24:55.080]  Right where you're at and just be able to say, well what's going on here?
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:03.344]  What's happening here that now we have a few people that have been indicted or went to go sacrifice themselves because of a cartoon?
[02:25:03.965 --> 02:25:14.570]  Yeah, and as far as I know, there aren't too many Christian churches where people are going around and finding people to go out and attack other people.
[02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:17.592]  I don't think that's happening widespread.
[02:25:18.979 --> 02:25:26.083]  So, you know, the Muslims need to not preach that if they are preaching it, and condemn it if it's not being done in their name.
[02:25:26.124 --> 02:25:27.144]  They need to condemn that stuff.
[02:25:27.424 --> 02:25:28.325]  Joe, do you have anything to say?
[02:25:28.365 --> 02:25:29.586]  You've been listening to us for a while.
[02:25:29.626 --> 02:25:30.106]  Can you hear us?
[02:25:32.608 --> 02:25:34.349]  This is Joe Biggs getting a selfie, it looks like.
[02:25:38.579 --> 02:25:40.640]  I've gotten a couple of Twitter responses here.
[02:25:40.680 --> 02:25:47.221]  Somebody asked, can he go to speak to somebody that's representative for the Muslim side, but I think he's being prevented from doing that by the police.
[02:25:47.341 --> 02:25:52.962]  Well, you know, Joe, if you can hear us, go over by the fence area and talk to some of those people there and let's get their side of the story.
[02:25:53.002 --> 02:25:55.722]  I'd love to hear what they have to say about what's going on now.
[02:25:56.622 --> 02:25:58.803]  It does look like it's getting a little dark out there.
[02:25:58.863 --> 02:26:00.063]  The sun is starting to go down.
[02:26:00.123 --> 02:26:00.243]  It's 730.
[02:26:00.603 --> 02:26:05.864]  They probably have another 30 minutes of somewhat having light in that area.
[02:26:05.984 --> 02:26:08.627]  Joe Biggs, can I get a 10-4 if you hear me?
[02:26:08.647 --> 02:26:12.130]  He might not have his earpiece in.
[02:26:12.833 --> 02:26:14.034]  He's unplugged, guys.
[02:26:14.874 --> 02:26:17.495]  Hey, I got a tweet from a Mark A. Bushy.
[02:26:17.935 --> 02:26:21.697]  He says, Dave, you know nothing about the Westboro Baptist Church.
[02:26:21.717 --> 02:26:37.325]  Well, yeah, I'm not an authority on the Westboro Baptist Church, but what I've seen of the Westboro Baptist Church is I've seen them say they are going to be the instrument, I guess, of God's rebuke and judgment to the United States for homosexuality, I think is what they have an issue with.
[02:26:37.705 --> 02:26:42.986]  So they show up to the funerals of soldiers and scream at these people.
[02:26:43.587 --> 02:26:50.628]  I'm sorry, but that is out of line under any circumstances and it has absolutely nothing to do with it.
[02:26:50.668 --> 02:26:53.669]  Christians don't rebuke people for something that they didn't do.
[02:26:53.889 --> 02:26:58.610]  And so yeah, I don't know a whole lot about them, but what I know about them is enough.
[02:26:59.091 --> 02:27:00.491]  I don't need to know any more than that.
[02:27:02.048 --> 02:27:03.789]  Yeah, I would totally agree.
[02:27:04.910 --> 02:27:09.132]  Anthony McAuley, he was one of the guys, or McAuley, he's the one who's asking for the split screen.
[02:27:09.152 --> 02:27:12.054]  So keep that, definitely keep that split screen up there, Marcos.
[02:27:12.134 --> 02:27:15.836]  We're, this is live on location in Phoenix, Arizona.
[02:27:15.856 --> 02:27:19.758]  Is anyone able to talk to Biggs?
[02:27:20.078 --> 02:27:22.160]  I don't know if Biggs can hear us right now.
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:24.181]  So he's just going to keep shooting.
[02:27:24.201 --> 02:27:25.962]  Alright.
[02:27:27.262 --> 02:27:27.943]  Turn this up, guys.
[02:27:30.452 --> 02:27:32.894]  They're just calling him racist.
[02:27:32.934 --> 02:27:35.595]  Can't tell what side he's on right now.
[02:27:59.341 --> 02:28:01.143]  So I just got a text from Joe.
[02:28:01.183 --> 02:28:03.927]  He said somebody asked to estimate how many people are open carrying.
[02:28:03.967 --> 02:28:08.132]  He said it's about 50 people there open carrying right now.
[02:28:08.553 --> 02:28:11.216]  I'm going to text him again since he's watching this.
[02:28:11.797 --> 02:28:12.297]  Are you texting?
[02:28:12.618 --> 02:28:14.140]  Ask him if he can go talk to the people at the fence.
[02:28:16.883 --> 02:28:18.124]  You're watching live coverage right now.
[02:28:18.164 --> 02:28:20.146]  This is InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:28:20.206 --> 02:28:22.147]  Your host, Leigh Ann McAdoo, sitting right over there.
[02:28:22.207 --> 02:28:22.648]  I'm Rob Dew.
[02:28:22.668 --> 02:28:24.069]  We've got David Knight in the control room.
[02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:28.953]  And all this is paid for by your support out there on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:28:30.354 --> 02:28:33.597]  I just got a tweet, Rob.
[02:28:34.117 --> 02:28:41.683]  Edward Smokes says, we need an emphasis on the two convicted people and the two shooters in Texas that came from there and Phoenix.
[02:28:41.724 --> 02:28:45.807]  Of course, we mentioned that earlier, but people who are just joining us may not have heard that.
[02:28:46.007 --> 02:28:46.487]  That's true.
[02:28:46.667 --> 02:28:54.290]  That was why one of the people there was so angry and so passionate about this particular event and why he was there in support of it.
[02:28:55.051 --> 02:28:56.131]  It wasn't just hearsay.
[02:28:56.191 --> 02:28:57.412]  He knew the people personally.
[02:28:57.512 --> 02:28:59.253]  Two of them had already been indicted.
[02:28:59.813 --> 02:29:01.173]  And then we had another two.
[02:29:01.193 --> 02:29:03.314]  Here's something from Zen Design.
[02:29:03.394 --> 02:29:07.056]  Wouldn't any and every description of Muhammad be a form of blasphemy?
[02:29:07.116 --> 02:29:09.997]  Even written words are painted pictures of him.
[02:29:10.964 --> 02:29:11.564]  There you go.
[02:29:11.704 --> 02:29:14.906]  I mean, a picture they say is a thousand words.
[02:29:14.926 --> 02:29:18.368]  So I guess when you draw a picture of them, it's a thousand blasphemies.
[02:29:18.428 --> 02:29:21.669]  But if you're just going to write the name Muhammad, is that a blasphemy?
[02:29:22.210 --> 02:29:23.410]  That which cannot be said.
[02:29:23.430 --> 02:29:27.252]  I think there's a Monty Python skit in there somewhere.
[02:29:29.893 --> 02:29:33.695]  My eternal thanks goes out to these bikers and InfoWars.
[02:29:33.735 --> 02:29:35.176]  Thanks for the late night coverage, guys.
[02:29:35.236 --> 02:29:36.697]  It's Gabriel Allen King.
[02:29:38.342 --> 02:29:39.343]  Thank you all for tweeting us.
[02:29:39.383 --> 02:29:40.663]  This is my first day on Twitter.
[02:29:40.723 --> 02:29:42.124]  I feel like such a big boy now.
[02:29:43.265 --> 02:29:43.565]  I know.
[02:29:43.605 --> 02:29:48.927]  So proud of you that it was an epic troll fashion that you were like, I've got to get a Twitter and respond.
[02:29:48.947 --> 02:29:49.648]  Gonna do it.
[02:29:50.468 --> 02:29:52.889]  You're probably already blocked by that guy.
[02:29:52.949 --> 02:29:55.971]  You think the globalists are not using these events against the people?
[02:29:56.251 --> 02:30:00.994]  The op is the more important point to cover.
[02:30:01.414 --> 02:30:05.436]  Well, I guess we got a lot of people asking us if this is a PsyOp meant to stir up
[02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:24.016]  Division and unrest the whole divide-and-conquer, and I don't know if this you know It doesn't seem like that guy right there as part of a psyop seems like he You know obviously put his life on the line and that of his family to go out there and organize this event But situations like this absolutely are going to divide the country
[02:30:24.216 --> 02:30:29.500]  The country is divided on this, and that's why you have Americans who have gone out here to say, enough is enough.
[02:30:29.860 --> 02:30:35.625]  We're not going to just sit back and passively allow our country and our freedoms to be stripped away.
[02:30:35.685 --> 02:30:39.468]  They hate us for our freedoms, so let's go ahead and give them up.
[02:30:39.648 --> 02:30:46.793]  That means a lot of people died for those freedoms, to make this the land of the free, the home of the brave.
[02:30:47.194 --> 02:30:51.177]  We're not brave because we're, you know, just sitting by twiddling our thumbs and
[02:30:52.017 --> 02:30:54.438]  Letting the mainstream media tell us everything is okay.
[02:30:54.798 --> 02:30:57.318]  We can see that the flag is upside down.
[02:30:58.779 --> 02:31:04.460]  You know, Leanne, I would also add too that this is just one aspect of the attack on freedom of speech.
[02:31:05.101 --> 02:31:11.142]  We see, really, it's not a violent attack that you get hit with if you go to the universities.
[02:31:11.222 --> 02:31:14.403]  It's a very subtle attack, but it can be devastating to people nevertheless.
[02:31:15.143 --> 02:31:20.965]  And so we need to understand all the different spectrums which this attack on freedom of speech is coming.
[02:31:22.096 --> 02:31:27.139]  Coming after people saying that your speech is hateful, your speech offends me, so you need to be silenced.
[02:31:27.579 --> 02:31:29.300]  We cannot allow that.
[02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:39.285]  And it doesn't matter whether it's a mosque, and of course this is the worst case example of it, so maybe this is a good point for us to step back and say, what's the principle involved here?
[02:31:39.545 --> 02:31:50.911]  And then take that principle to other areas where they're not threatening to kill you, but they're threatening to destroy your business, destroy your personal life, fine you perhaps, because we've seen this in other countries where they say you can
[02:31:51.972 --> 02:31:53.833]  Get excessive fines for hate speech.
[02:31:54.193 --> 02:31:57.414]  David, you probably recognize this name, Gert Wilders.
[02:31:57.514 --> 02:32:01.775]  He wrote a book, I guess, called Marked for Death, Islam's War Against the West and Me.
[02:32:01.835 --> 02:32:02.915]  Somebody tweeted this.
[02:32:02.975 --> 02:32:06.016]  That was the guy with Pamela Geller, right?
[02:32:06.096 --> 02:32:08.437]  Is he from Holland or the Netherlands?
[02:32:08.457 --> 02:32:09.757]  Yeah, he's from the Netherlands.
[02:32:09.857 --> 02:32:13.759]  And they've had a fatwa on him for a long time, trying to kill him wherever he is.
[02:32:13.879 --> 02:32:15.839]  Everywhere he goes, he's got to watch out where he goes.
[02:32:15.999 --> 02:32:17.660]  That speaks volumes right there.
[02:32:18.467 --> 02:32:19.588]  As to what's going on with it.
[02:32:19.608 --> 02:32:21.609]  There's a lot of people I hate.
[02:32:21.629 --> 02:32:23.511]  I just ignore them or block them on Twitter.
[02:32:24.391 --> 02:32:25.412]  I try not to hate anyone.
[02:32:27.514 --> 02:32:31.697]  The guy who sent this also said Islam is not here to assimilate.
[02:32:32.217 --> 02:32:32.517]  You know what?
[02:32:32.618 --> 02:32:34.039]  We're not asking them to assimilate.
[02:32:34.679 --> 02:32:37.702]  But don't get in our business and we won't get in your business.
[02:32:37.722 --> 02:32:38.143]  How's that?
[02:32:38.263 --> 02:32:43.569]  Well, I see someone there with a poster that says Sharia law is not in alignment with the Constitution.
[02:32:43.929 --> 02:32:45.671]  And that's exactly it.
[02:32:45.691 --> 02:32:48.094]  And there's the other question there.
[02:32:48.114 --> 02:32:51.878]  You can't come here and have your own laws that are above the Constitution.
[02:32:51.918 --> 02:32:52.439]  That doesn't work.
[02:32:52.999 --> 02:32:57.543]  That comes, immigrates to America, gets to come here and say, well, this is how we did it in my country.
[02:32:57.863 --> 02:32:59.004]  That's not how it works.
[02:32:59.364 --> 02:33:01.346]  I've looked into moving to other countries.
[02:33:01.746 --> 02:33:04.428]  I don't get to go there and go change how they do things there.
[02:33:04.588 --> 02:33:05.629]  I have to assimilate.
[02:33:05.970 --> 02:33:07.050]  It's the same thing here.
[02:33:07.090 --> 02:33:13.235]  You don't get to, and so that's, that's the big question is what sort of authoritarian government would be
[02:33:14.192 --> 02:33:18.593]  I'm appreciative of allowing something like this to start stripping away at people.
[02:33:18.693 --> 02:33:22.954]  Don't offend them because they'll blow up the metro station.
[02:33:23.094 --> 02:33:25.515]  Better not get under their skin.
[02:33:25.535 --> 02:33:35.137]  It says a lot because they allow ISIS to get away with destroying ancient cities and things like that in the Middle East.
[02:33:35.177 --> 02:33:35.897]  They're arming them.
[02:33:35.917 --> 02:33:40.438]  They're allowing them to take down Ramadi there in Iraq.
[02:33:40.538 --> 02:33:42.639]  Oh, do we have Biggs back?
[02:33:42.739 --> 02:33:43.359]  Oh, he's just saying.
[02:33:44.119 --> 02:33:50.141]  You know, it's just, they're allowing all this to happen to, like, instill fear in the world, in the globe.
[02:33:50.381 --> 02:33:54.062]  And now they're, it's trickling into America, and so that is what this is about.
[02:33:54.262 --> 02:33:55.143]  People saying, no!
[02:33:55.963 --> 02:33:58.644]  We're absolutely not afraid of this, and we're not going to be passive.
[02:33:58.744 --> 02:34:07.547]  Not saying that all Muslims are bad, and Islam is bad, and, because I hate that, that's just a generalization right there, and that's absolutely not what this is all about.
[02:34:08.187 --> 02:34:11.768]  But we can't just refuse to call it radical Islam.
[02:34:13.730 --> 02:34:21.314]  Oxnard Montalvo says, interview more Muslims, I'd like to hear the excuse for being upset while living in the USA.
[02:34:22.695 --> 02:34:23.895]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:34:24.796 --> 02:34:31.539]  You know, you don't like this country, you don't like the way things are done, there's a million other countries, well not a million, a hundred other countries you can go to.
[02:34:32.519 --> 02:34:33.680]  And don't come to ours.
[02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:37.401]  If it's so bad, if we're so evil, if we're so wrong, go somewhere else.
[02:34:38.122 --> 02:34:39.963]  We don't need to be bothered with your nonsense.
[02:34:40.902 --> 02:34:44.067]  That's what I'd like to say and personally how I feel.
[02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:48.213]  I'm very open to the stuff that I tolerate in my life.
[02:34:48.373 --> 02:34:49.295]  I'm very open.
[02:34:50.096 --> 02:34:52.620]  Except when it comes to henpecking when I'm trying to find a parking spot.
[02:34:54.362 --> 02:34:56.145]  I don't take kindly to that at all.
[02:34:56.414 --> 02:35:02.040]  You know, Rob, you talked earlier about the universities, and we've seen several reports from several different universities.
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:04.923]  This is going on all over the place, where they have free speech areas.
[02:35:04.983 --> 02:35:08.367]  This is the new trend for destroying the First Amendment.
[02:35:08.387 --> 02:35:09.788]  They're teaching you tolerance, David.
[02:35:09.808 --> 02:35:15.675]  Yeah, we've seen it done at political conventions for the last several cycles, where they take all the protesters, put them literally in a cage,
[02:35:16.215 --> 02:35:18.156]  Blocks away from the political convention.
[02:35:18.196 --> 02:35:23.858]  We saw at the Bundy Ranch where they created a free speech area out in the middle of nowhere, literally.
[02:35:24.318 --> 02:35:29.620]  And somebody hung a sign there that says, free speech, the First Amendment is not an area.
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:30.320]  That's it.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:34.502]  And we have to understand that this is something that is, this is a big problem with Islam.
[02:35:35.242 --> 02:35:37.663]  This is also a problem with our universities.
[02:35:37.723 --> 02:35:46.767]  That is where they are also trying to create this repressive approach against the exercise of free speech.
[02:35:47.107 --> 02:35:47.908]  It is systemic.
[02:35:48.248 --> 02:35:52.550]  It is something that they train the kids and that's part of their university education.
[02:35:52.570 --> 02:35:55.631]  It used to be that you went there to embrace freedom.
[02:35:55.731 --> 02:35:56.392]  To ask questions.
[02:35:56.412 --> 02:35:57.732]  To debate and ask questions.
[02:35:58.112 --> 02:36:01.514]  Now you have to toe the politically correct line.
[02:36:02.034 --> 02:36:06.918]  Whether that's on climate change, or whether it's on white privilege, or feminism, or whatever.
[02:36:07.299 --> 02:36:09.361]  You have to toe their line.
[02:36:09.421 --> 02:36:24.314]  And so that, in a sense, I think, even though this is very violent and focused on people who are criticizing Mohammed, I think an even greater danger is what is going on in the universities because it is so broad-based and pervasive.
[02:36:24.850 --> 02:36:26.331]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[02:36:26.371 --> 02:36:28.072]  And, you know, I went to WVU.
[02:36:28.092 --> 02:36:29.452]  That's where I got my undergrad.
[02:36:30.213 --> 02:36:33.474]  And there was a lot of liberal leanings there.
[02:36:33.494 --> 02:36:37.596]  Definitely being a theater major, there was a lot of liberals and left leaning there.
[02:36:37.616 --> 02:36:40.458]  And I dealt a lot with that writing for the newspaper.
[02:36:40.998 --> 02:36:44.840]  I would write stuff about Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich.
[02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:47.801]  Newt Gingrich was the speaker at the time, and there was a lot of clashes there.
[02:36:47.821 --> 02:36:49.042]  And I'm like, look, they're all in on it.
[02:36:49.242 --> 02:36:49.943]  Y'all don't see that?
[02:36:50.383 --> 02:36:51.823]  And, oh, Bill Clinton's doing a good thing.
[02:36:53.084 --> 02:36:55.846]  But what was interesting there, we didn't have free speech zones.
[02:36:56.466 --> 02:37:02.890]  Once a week, there was a guy who would get out and he would literally bring a soapbox and stand on it and preach the Bible.
[02:37:03.370 --> 02:37:04.571]  And we called him the Bible guy.
[02:37:05.031 --> 02:37:06.292]  And he would argue with people.
[02:37:06.352 --> 02:37:07.172]  You'd be walking to class.
[02:37:07.192 --> 02:37:08.933]  You gonna talk, Biggs?
[02:37:09.253 --> 02:37:09.834]  Go ahead, Biggs.
[02:37:09.854 --> 02:37:12.555]  How you guys doing?
[02:37:12.795 --> 02:37:13.296]  Go ahead, buddy.
[02:37:13.436 --> 02:37:13.856]  Go ahead.
[02:37:14.456 --> 02:37:15.417]  Can you hear us?
[02:37:15.797 --> 02:37:17.318]  Yeah, stuff's pretty tense.
[02:37:17.378 --> 02:37:18.719]  There were some guys that were
[02:37:19.477 --> 02:37:22.459]  Yelling that they were going to gang rape that girl in the pink.
[02:37:22.479 --> 02:37:23.620]  I don't know if you remember seeing her.
[02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:24.080]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:24.740 --> 02:37:29.743]  But the Muslim guys on the other side, they said they're going to find her after this and gang rape her.
[02:37:29.803 --> 02:37:30.064]  Wow.
[02:37:30.084 --> 02:37:31.224]  That sounds peaceful.
[02:37:32.245 --> 02:37:33.406]  Yeah, it was very peaceful.
[02:37:35.747 --> 02:37:38.289]  So, I mean, I mean, that's the kind of stuff that's going on.
[02:37:38.329 --> 02:37:39.590]  It's pretty out of control at this point.
[02:37:39.630 --> 02:37:41.110]  I mean, I mean, what an insane threat.
[02:37:41.130 --> 02:37:46.714]  There's a lot of screaming and yelling and everyone's making threats that, hey, once the police leave, once it gets dark, it's going to be on.
[02:37:47.253 --> 02:37:48.994]  So it seems like there's a lot of people who have decided to come out here.
[02:37:49.034 --> 02:37:50.956]  Well, the police aren't going to leave.
[02:37:50.976 --> 02:37:51.056]  Yeah.
[02:37:51.076 --> 02:37:54.698]  Well, yeah, I know, but they're just people angry and talking, and who knows what'll happen.
[02:37:54.858 --> 02:37:58.061]  Are you able to go and speak to any of the people there at the fence?
[02:37:59.942 --> 02:38:01.783]  As far as, you know, people on our side?
[02:38:02.083 --> 02:38:03.044]  No, on the Muslim side.
[02:38:03.064 --> 02:38:04.065]  We're just private property.
[02:38:04.105 --> 02:38:06.607]  Yeah, they're over there talking to people on the fence.
[02:38:07.347 --> 02:38:10.849]  I saw you with your camera close, kind of close.
[02:38:10.890 --> 02:38:11.810]  Yeah, they're screaming.
[02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:12.671]  They're screaming over it.
[02:38:12.711 --> 02:38:15.773]  I mean, it's very vulgar language, so if I get behind you guys a little bit,
[02:38:16.761 --> 02:38:18.041]  Hey, it's freedom of speech, Biggs.
[02:38:18.261 --> 02:38:19.282]  Freedom of speech.
[02:38:19.422 --> 02:38:20.222]  We can take it.
[02:38:20.402 --> 02:38:21.442]  This isn't the radio.
[02:38:21.482 --> 02:38:23.203]  We don't have to worry about the FCC.
[02:38:23.223 --> 02:38:26.483]  This is streaming over the internet.
[02:38:26.543 --> 02:38:27.904]  Yeah, and to the interwebs.
[02:38:28.184 --> 02:38:37.006]  So this lady right here, she's been yelling for a while at them, and then they go back and forth.
[02:38:49.657 --> 02:38:53.801]  Can you go over to the fence where the, uh, kind of like the compound was?
[02:38:53.821 --> 02:38:54.982]  It was that iron fence earlier.
[02:38:55.002 --> 02:38:56.003]  The iron fence?
[02:38:57.205 --> 02:38:58.666]  Oh yeah, those guys walked off already.
[02:38:59.807 --> 02:39:01.929]  If you see them, some people would like you to interview them.
[02:39:01.969 --> 02:39:04.351]  We're getting tweets about that, get their side of the story.
[02:39:04.371 --> 02:39:05.913]  Which I think would be interesting.
[02:39:06.053 --> 02:39:06.373]  I do too!
[02:39:07.421 --> 02:39:09.043]  There's a, there's a housing area back over there.
[02:39:09.063 --> 02:39:11.645]  So they go back over there, hang out for a minute, and then they come back to the fence.
[02:39:12.006 --> 02:39:14.308]  Okay, well grab, yeah, grab him if you can.
[02:39:15.850 --> 02:39:19.834]  But, uh, if you can see the people over here straight across in that, like, tie-dye looking shirt.
[02:39:20.034 --> 02:39:20.174]  Yeah.
[02:39:20.214 --> 02:39:21.615]  He's the one that's been making the threats.
[02:39:22.436 --> 02:39:22.937]  Oh, really?
[02:39:22.957 --> 02:39:24.779]  He looked like he was trying to wave you down a second ago.
[02:39:30.465 --> 02:39:32.846]  It takes a real man to threaten a woman.
[02:39:32.866 --> 02:39:37.708]  I mean, to just make a threat like that, that's just disgusting.
[02:39:38.148 --> 02:39:42.289]  You know, Robbie, you were talking about the people at your university, a guy who would get up and get on a soapbox.
[02:39:42.549 --> 02:39:46.351]  They actually have a speaker's corner in Hyde Park in the UK every Sunday.
[02:39:47.091 --> 02:39:50.292]  People can take a soapbox and they can stand up there and talk about whatever they want.
[02:39:50.812 --> 02:39:56.234]  Usually it's politics and religion, and the last time I was in the UK, last time I was in London, was 14 years ago.
[02:39:58.815 --> 02:40:03.037]  I had been there many times before, but this was a really, really hot discussion.
[02:40:03.097 --> 02:40:08.741]  It was a Christian standing up, talking about religion, talking about Christianity, and the Muslims were screaming at him.
[02:40:08.801 --> 02:40:16.085]  And I noticed all the Babis just start quietly start walking over and standing there with their hands crossed in front of them, keeping an eye on this situation.
[02:40:16.105 --> 02:40:18.786]  They could see this thing escalating because these guys were getting real.
[02:40:18.826 --> 02:40:21.488]  It wasn't just one or two, it was a group of Muslims.
[02:40:22.388 --> 02:40:32.275]  Uh, coming after this, about to get violent with this Christian and he just kept talking on the soapbox and the police just kept assembling in a larger and larger group.
[02:40:32.815 --> 02:40:34.716]  That's what it's fundamentally about.
[02:40:34.896 --> 02:40:40.100]  You cannot allow yourself to be intimidated to get off of that soapbox.
[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:44.343]  And the government has to stand there and defend that.
[02:40:44.423 --> 02:40:45.844]  That's what the First Amendment is for.
[02:40:45.884 --> 02:40:49.127]  It's not just... It says it's to keep Congress from making any laws to take it back.
[02:40:49.347 --> 02:40:53.951]  But it's also the responsibility of government to protect all of our rights, however they can.
[02:40:53.991 --> 02:40:59.515]  And that means that that's one of the very things that the government, the police, the law enforcement should be doing.
[02:40:59.535 --> 02:41:03.859]  And that is protecting people's free speech, just like I saw at Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park.
[02:41:04.099 --> 02:41:09.102]  And when the government isn't protecting it, you have the right to protect it with your Second Amendment.
[02:41:09.282 --> 02:41:09.743]  Absolutely.
[02:41:09.883 --> 02:41:10.643]  That's what it's for.
[02:41:10.903 --> 02:41:19.629]  That is one of the biggest things we preach here, and Head Down Firearms is one of our, is our big sponsor, is our only firearm sponsor, and they're there.
[02:41:19.649 --> 02:41:20.289]  What do you got, Biggs?
[02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:25.752]  Alright, so one thing I want you to notice is, look how there's a lot of empty space.
[02:41:26.113 --> 02:41:26.833]  Yeah.
[02:41:26.853 --> 02:41:31.836]  A lot of people on this side are starting to clear out, and the other side is getting much larger.
[02:41:33.564 --> 02:41:33.804]  Wow.
[02:41:34.785 --> 02:41:36.565]  How's it broken down between sides, would you say?
[02:41:36.585 --> 02:41:42.588]  It's changing right now, but... How would you compare the size of the crowd?
[02:41:42.608 --> 02:41:45.110]  You say it's changing right now, how would you say it is?
[02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:50.252]  Yeah, I would say they probably outnumber us by about a hundred or so at this point now.
[02:41:51.953 --> 02:41:52.093]  Wow.
[02:41:52.153 --> 02:41:53.434]  And how many law enforcement are there?
[02:41:54.434 --> 02:42:01.397]  Um, let me see... Uh, twenty... About seventy still.
[02:42:02.318 --> 02:42:02.478]  Okay.
[02:42:03.403 --> 02:42:05.184]  Hey, what's the Marines name again?
[02:42:05.444 --> 02:42:05.664]  Joe?
[02:42:05.704 --> 02:42:12.647]  Any kind of road, any kind of road that gets into this area has been blocked off from far back.
[02:42:12.687 --> 02:42:17.349]  You've got to drive way out and around and then circle back and then walk a good ways to even get out this way.
[02:42:17.649 --> 02:42:30.955]  And they did that, I'm assuming, to counter any type of VBID threat because, you know, those tweets that came out a while back by some of those ISIS Twitter accounts saying that they weren't going to use bullets and guns wouldn't stop an attack.
[02:42:31.311 --> 02:42:34.012]  Which means that they were kind of hinting at some kind of explosion.
[02:42:34.472 --> 02:42:40.474]  So I think they took that into effect here and blocked off any kind of roadway that comes in here so no cars can even get here.
[02:42:40.774 --> 02:42:43.635]  They blocked off every little area, so you have to come in on foot.
[02:42:43.895 --> 02:42:47.016]  So if anything does happen out here, it'll be from a person.
[02:42:47.556 --> 02:42:49.317]  It won't be by vehicle or anything like that.
[02:42:49.637 --> 02:42:50.958]  There's no parked vehicles there then?
[02:42:51.818 --> 02:42:53.118]  No, everything's far away.
[02:42:53.138 --> 02:42:54.979]  The only vehicles in the area are police.
[02:42:55.559 --> 02:43:00.961]  There's one big RV, but that's inside the Muslim compound area right over here.
[02:43:02.179 --> 02:43:04.640]  And that's been there for, I don't know, the whole day so far.
[02:43:07.282 --> 02:43:12.025]  It's interesting that now the Muslims have cleared off from that fenced area where they were there earlier talking with people.
[02:43:12.065 --> 02:43:15.587]  You showed a little bit of people interacting there, and they weren't cussing each other out.
[02:43:15.627 --> 02:43:16.828]  They were talking and smiling.
[02:43:18.268 --> 02:43:21.210]  Yeah, I mean, they were having an alright conversation about stuff.
[02:43:21.230 --> 02:43:23.491]  They understand some of the people's concerns.
[02:43:23.852 --> 02:43:28.154]  You know, a lot of people are saying, uh, don't F, you know, Islam, but F ISIS.
[02:43:28.955 --> 02:43:31.256]  And then you've got a lot of different groups out here that are just
[02:43:32.350 --> 02:43:38.331]  They pretty much came out here to be rowdy, you know, on both sides.
[02:43:38.351 --> 02:43:38.571]  Right.
[02:43:38.611 --> 02:43:40.012]  Go ahead.
[02:43:40.852 --> 02:43:47.713]  Yeah, those are the kind of people that are, you know, they put in place so they can take away from the, you know, the entire meaning of being out here.
[02:43:48.133 --> 02:43:53.054]  The fact that this is about our country, you know, our First Amendment rights under attack.
[02:43:53.435 --> 02:43:57.375]  The fact that under this president, more journalists have been attacked.
[02:43:57.415 --> 02:44:00.156]  The fact that whistleblowers are completely
[02:44:00.876 --> 02:44:01.297]  I'm good.
[02:44:12.597 --> 02:44:12.797]  Yeah.
[02:44:12.977 --> 02:44:14.218]  You know, that's the country we live in.
[02:44:14.498 --> 02:44:22.642]  And Joe, if anything were to happen now, the mainstream media is going to jump on and say, well, it was those people wanting to go out there and stir up the Muslims and carry around their guns.
[02:44:23.103 --> 02:44:24.103]  And that's the big problem.
[02:44:24.143 --> 02:44:24.903]  That's what it'll be.
[02:44:24.923 --> 02:44:29.886]  It won't be the fact that, you know, whoever attacked first, that there was a clash.
[02:44:30.066 --> 02:44:32.027]  I mean, right now, it doesn't look like anybody's attacking anybody.
[02:44:32.728 --> 02:44:35.089]  But I guarantee you, the people who will get blamed
[02:44:36.016 --> 02:44:36.356]  Oh yeah.
[02:44:36.536 --> 02:44:38.618]  We'll be the ones who started the protest.
[02:44:38.658 --> 02:44:56.288]  And even if this remains a completely peaceful protest, that guy that was out there doing the interview, Fox News, you know, I don't know how they've been covering it, what angle they're taking, but surely they've got to get a story out of this if they sent a reporter out there, and so it'll be really interesting to see how they spin this event.
[02:44:56.348 --> 02:44:57.129]  Let's hear what she's saying.
[02:45:00.304 --> 02:45:01.065]  Why are you out here?
[02:45:26.519 --> 02:45:27.480]  Why am I out here?
[02:45:28.220 --> 02:45:29.441]  Go ask them why they're out here.
[02:45:29.862 --> 02:45:31.022]  Because they don't seem to know.
[02:45:31.162 --> 02:45:33.764]  Well, I'm asking you, why did you decide to come out here?
[02:45:33.784 --> 02:45:34.825]  Why am I out here?
[02:45:34.865 --> 02:45:40.489]  There's American citizens that were killed from people that came from this mass, this address, right down the corner from where I live.
[02:45:41.090 --> 02:45:41.830]  That's why I'm out here.
[02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:49.896]  I'm supposed to be, I'm peacefully protesting, and people are over there calling me ignorant because of the color of my skin, saying that I'm a Nazi lover, all sorts of stuff, which is ridiculous.
[02:45:49.956 --> 02:45:51.898]  I'm still trying to hear some intelligent information.
[02:45:53.059 --> 02:45:53.719]  That's why I'm here.
[02:45:53.739 --> 02:45:54.280]  Alright, cool.
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:55.060]  Have a nice day.
[02:45:56.601 --> 02:45:58.062]  That's a good point, Joe.
[02:45:58.482 --> 02:46:00.403]  Give us a breakdown on the factions that are there.
[02:46:00.483 --> 02:46:11.170]  The organizer who was there earlier said that he was spat on by some people, so I'm assuming those are some protesters on the non-Muslim side that were counter-protesting?
[02:46:11.190 --> 02:46:12.350]  Is that correct?
[02:46:13.831 --> 02:46:14.952]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:46:15.272 --> 02:46:16.753]  I mean, there's all kinds of groups of people out here.
[02:46:16.773 --> 02:46:23.717]  You've got your veterans, like motorcycle clubs, a lot of guys who are ex-Army, Marine, Navy, all that.
[02:46:24.042 --> 02:46:26.924]  And they have a little, you know, a motorcycle club.
[02:46:26.964 --> 02:46:27.724]  They're all out here.
[02:46:28.124 --> 02:46:31.586]  There's a lot of the 1%ers, 13%ers.
[02:46:32.186 --> 02:46:34.728]  Then you've got a lot of the 3%ers that are out here.
[02:46:34.768 --> 02:46:36.089]  There's a lot of different groups of people.
[02:46:36.989 --> 02:46:41.952]  The other side, at this point, at the very end down here, are the ones that are screaming out stuff.
[02:46:41.972 --> 02:46:46.154]  But I mean, this whole area on the side I'm on is starting to clear out.
[02:46:47.236 --> 02:46:57.845]  Which makes you think of... So on the non-Muslim side, do you have some people that are there that are protesting the protests or the counter-protesters on your side?
[02:46:58.146 --> 02:47:00.067]  Besides the people who are veterans and that sort of thing?
[02:47:00.107 --> 02:47:00.247]  No?
[02:47:01.028 --> 02:47:01.248]  No.
[02:47:01.569 --> 02:47:03.090]  What about the other side?
[02:47:03.570 --> 02:47:05.652]  How would you characterize, how would you break that down in terms of...
[02:47:06.753 --> 02:47:18.538]  Muslims who are yelling and screaming violent threats and are there any over there who are protesting the violent, the people who are making violent threats?
[02:47:18.558 --> 02:47:22.059]  In other words, are they saying, tone it down, that's not what we represent.
[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:27.842]  You've got a group of people who are, they're over there chanting USA now as well.
[02:47:28.162 --> 02:47:32.964]  So you've got a smaller group of people who are making death threats and things like that.
[02:47:32.984 --> 02:47:35.005]  Then you've got another group of people who are saying, hey,
[02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:40.863]  Uh, we don't agree with ISIS, but, you know, you can't hate all of Islam because of a few bad apples.
[02:47:41.364 --> 02:47:45.706]  So most of those people are on that side over there, and that's the only side that you can really get to.
[02:47:45.906 --> 02:47:53.791]  But what do they say about the fact that there have been now four individuals that have had ties to ISIS?
[02:47:53.811 --> 02:47:54.832]  I can't get close enough to it.
[02:47:54.952 --> 02:47:55.853]  I can't get close to it.
[02:47:56.113 --> 02:47:58.934]  As soon as the cops see me get over that way, they're like, yeah, you're not gonna last long.
[02:47:59.977 --> 02:48:08.401]  Do you see any tension on the other side, Joe, between the people who are chanting USA on the Islam side and the people who are making violent threats on the Islam side?
[02:48:08.441 --> 02:48:10.443]  Are those two going after each other?
[02:48:10.463 --> 02:48:14.845]  I think it looks like everyone on that side is ignoring the fact that they have differences over there.
[02:48:15.225 --> 02:48:20.728]  And they're more focused on, apparently, all of us white Nazis who hate everybody.
[02:48:20.868 --> 02:48:22.209]  Empyrean Northpigs.
[02:48:23.009 --> 02:48:23.309]  Yeah.
[02:48:23.409 --> 02:48:23.830]  Empyrean.
[02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:24.250]  Fascist.
[02:48:27.225 --> 02:48:31.108]  Well, that's the easiest thing to do is identity politics.
[02:48:31.888 --> 02:48:37.652]  Hey Joe, Natalie V just popped in and said, tell Joe nothing going on in Cleveland, good call going to Phoenix.
[02:48:38.273 --> 02:48:43.336]  I'd definitely say you had a good nose for that, of seeing that come out.
[02:48:43.356 --> 02:48:46.499]  This is definitely the news story of the day, at least.
[02:48:47.319 --> 02:48:52.943]  And hopefully nothing goes wrong and people can go out there and say, you know, and pull out their, put all their First Amendment.
[02:48:53.003 --> 02:49:02.189]  Hopefully this will get a conversation started and not just demonize people who are exercising their First and Second Amendment because they're allowed to do that.
[02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:03.510]  That is their right to do that.
[02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:05.871]  We're in America and hopefully this will start a conversation.
[02:49:06.312 --> 02:49:15.838]  It won't just get turned into this racial division and, you know, racist, white people against, you know, an entire religion and all that.
[02:49:16.058 --> 02:49:17.118]  Joe, read some of those signs.
[02:49:17.578 --> 02:49:19.639]  I can't really make out what they are.
[02:49:19.659 --> 02:49:23.260]  As soon as I get near here, people start shining lights.
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:24.700]  Oh wow, that's interesting.
[02:49:25.301 --> 02:49:29.042]  I've got a tweet from Crazy Horse saying thanks goes to the Phoenix Police Department.
[02:49:29.062 --> 02:49:30.722]  That person doesn't want to be on camera.
[02:49:31.722 --> 02:49:32.522]  That person right there.
[02:49:32.542 --> 02:49:34.963]  They're so far away and it's dark, I guess they don't understand how cameras work.
[02:49:38.144 --> 02:49:38.884]  What does that one say?
[02:49:38.924 --> 02:49:40.865]  Love not hate?
[02:49:41.385 --> 02:49:42.365]  Yeah, love not hate.
[02:49:42.465 --> 02:49:43.565]  One said, like I said, F-ISIS.
[02:49:46.201 --> 02:49:47.642]  Uh, but don't F Islam.
[02:49:48.283 --> 02:49:52.186]  Uh, I can't see that good right now because I was just, uh, flashing the eyes, so... Us too.
[02:49:52.266 --> 02:49:55.589]  Let me... No Revcom.
[02:49:55.609 --> 02:49:57.650]  Let me see if I can... No Revcom representatives.
[02:49:58.151 --> 02:49:58.992]  Are we, are we seeing those?
[02:49:59.252 --> 02:50:01.293]  Oh no, they're not going to be at a place like this.
[02:50:01.814 --> 02:50:02.074]  Yeah.
[02:50:04.036 --> 02:50:05.417]  Love your neighbor as yourself.
[02:50:05.617 --> 02:50:07.418]  Uh, love your neighbor.
[02:50:07.438 --> 02:50:09.340]  A lot of people holding love your neighbor signs.
[02:50:10.649 --> 02:50:12.772]  I think those are the ones in the blue you guys were talking about.
[02:50:12.872 --> 02:50:13.493]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:13.893 --> 02:50:22.604]  Do they bring those signs to these mosques when, you know, the people are preparing to go and, uh, what do they call it?
[02:50:23.962 --> 02:50:24.682]  Going jihad?
[02:50:25.463 --> 02:50:34.408]  It seems like a couple people here that we've heard from, they've had personal effects from this, where people have gone out and shot the one guy in the beginning.
[02:50:34.429 --> 02:50:34.989]  Yeah, that's what he said.
[02:50:35.049 --> 02:50:36.270]  And then the girl he just talked to.
[02:50:36.390 --> 02:50:45.916]  And then, yeah, that was right down the street, so they must have all known the same person that that happened to, and that two people from this particular mosque, and they were indicted, and then they had two more.
[02:50:46.676 --> 02:50:51.660]  And so, you know, we don't want to say that it's this mosque because I'm sure they have plenty of other mosques.
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:55.042]  There's a whole online community, things like that.
[02:50:55.102 --> 02:51:00.706]  So, you know, we don't want to say that it's they're training these people here or whatever, but there is some sort of an element.
[02:51:01.107 --> 02:51:07.431]  And so people need to be able to address this and to be able to say, wait a minute, this is not what we're about.
[02:51:07.571 --> 02:51:08.412]  What is happening?
[02:51:08.452 --> 02:51:12.895]  Let's, you know, let's see where the dark elements are within our own organization.
[02:51:13.396 --> 02:51:15.777]  And are they already under investigation?
[02:51:17.578 --> 02:51:19.660]  I mean, why is that not a point of focus?
[02:51:20.481 --> 02:51:25.205]  I wonder if, you know, that reporter went and asked anyone on that side anything like that.
[02:51:25.265 --> 02:51:33.492]  No, he just wanted to condemn the Marine for speaking his mind and getting people active, getting people off their couches and protecting and exercising their First and Second Amendment.
[02:51:33.813 --> 02:51:34.533]  You can't have that.
[02:51:34.553 --> 02:51:36.275]  They've got to be at home watching TV.
[02:51:36.655 --> 02:51:37.976]  Biggs, it'd be really interesting.
[02:51:37.996 --> 02:51:39.738]  Thanks to all you out there that are watching TV right now.
[02:51:40.438 --> 02:51:55.610]  If you can hear me, it'd be really interesting for you to get maybe even a second interview with the people that had that experience and if you could get any more information about that particular case because that's definitely not something that's going to be talked about on the news with regards to this event.
[02:51:55.830 --> 02:51:59.113]  It's just going to all be to demonize that Marine and all the people that are out there.
[02:51:59.593 --> 02:52:06.699]  It's not going to, they're not going to point out why he was moved and compelled enough to put his life in danger.
[02:52:08.140 --> 02:52:11.081]  So if you can, get a second meet-up with them.
[02:52:11.201 --> 02:52:17.424]  Ernesto, if you've been watching, Biggs has been trying to go over to the other side and talk to people, and the cops will not let him over there.
[02:52:17.444 --> 02:52:20.946]  They're keeping both groups completely apart.
[02:52:21.506 --> 02:52:28.009]  There was a small group of Muslims on the back side from an adjoining property, but they're no longer there.
[02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:31.531]  And that is why you're only getting this one side.
[02:52:31.571 --> 02:52:34.092]  The cops are not letting people co-mingle at this point.
[02:52:34.454 --> 02:52:41.816]  And even though we would like to get an interview, I agree with one of the tweets that I got from Crazy Horse that says, kudos to the police for keeping it peaceful.
[02:52:42.456 --> 02:52:47.178]  I think they've done a very good job and they haven't been provocative to either side.
[02:52:47.898 --> 02:52:50.479]  And they're only dressed like half a Darth Vader at this point.
[02:52:50.499 --> 02:52:52.599]  They're not in full Darth Vader gear.
[02:52:52.619 --> 02:52:54.180]  Full on Stormtrooper, yeah.
[02:52:55.700 --> 02:53:05.403]  Yeah, I mean, Biggs, if you're going to be there anyway, it would be interesting, once this all kind of settles down, if you are able to get an alternative perspective from the other side.
[02:53:05.423 --> 02:53:08.263]  That looks so good.
[02:53:08.283 --> 02:53:09.324]  Some water?
[02:53:09.744 --> 02:53:11.164]  The water looks so good, yeah, I know.
[02:53:11.184 --> 02:53:12.705]  I haven't even eaten today yet.
[02:53:13.705 --> 02:53:13.945]  Yeah.
[02:53:13.985 --> 02:53:15.605]  You're a true info warrior, Joe.
[02:53:15.945 --> 02:53:18.926]  I told him that's why you always got to keep a Clif Bar in your bag.
[02:53:19.126 --> 02:53:21.327]  I keep a Clif Bar in my bag, just for these occasions.
[02:53:24.676 --> 02:53:25.677]  Oh, there you go.
[02:53:25.717 --> 02:53:26.558]  Talk to that person.
[02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:28.980]  Talk to that person.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.342]  Go, go, go.
[02:53:30.382 --> 02:53:30.802]  Talk to him.
[02:53:30.842 --> 02:53:32.204]  Yeah, let me go over there.
[02:53:32.264 --> 02:53:34.326]  That way I get tackled to the ground and we're done.
[02:53:35.587 --> 02:53:38.610]  Anybody that tries to walk over there, they stop you right away.
[02:53:39.331 --> 02:53:41.052]  Biggs, are you afraid of getting tackled?
[02:53:42.234 --> 02:53:42.634]  Uh, no.
[02:53:42.654 --> 02:53:43.255]  I have a gun.
[02:53:44.196 --> 02:53:46.938]  But if I get tackled, then the show's over, you know?
[02:53:47.218 --> 02:53:49.380]  No, then the show just gets started!
[02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:55.184]  Okay, when this falls off the thing and hits the ground and breaks, then you guys have no way of knowing what's going on.
[02:53:56.304 --> 02:53:58.126]  I just got a tweet from Andrew Liebich.
[02:53:58.186 --> 02:54:05.691]  He said that Chris Cuomo just went on CNN and said, quote, hate speech has no protections under the First Amendment.
[02:54:06.191 --> 02:54:07.512]  Sorry, read it.
[02:54:08.053 --> 02:54:09.874]  It doesn't make any exceptions for hate speech.
[02:54:11.476 --> 02:54:12.638]  CNN's Chris Cuomo.
[02:54:12.678 --> 02:54:15.022]  But the guy there was just saying he would gang rape that girl.
[02:54:15.042 --> 02:54:16.063]  Let's get a picture of Chris Cuomo up.
[02:54:16.083 --> 02:54:17.706]  So that sounds like hate speech to me.
[02:54:18.106 --> 02:54:23.194]  Or tweeting out on, ISIS tweeting out that they're going to attack this Marine and his whole family.
[02:54:23.214 --> 02:54:26.319]  That they're saying that they're going to behead people.
[02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:28.321]  Come across the line and stab people.
[02:54:28.341 --> 02:54:29.021]  That's not hateful.
[02:54:29.282 --> 02:54:29.962]  That's fine.
[02:54:30.002 --> 02:54:33.144]  There's a difference between making bodily threats to people, okay?
[02:54:33.424 --> 02:54:34.845]  That can be called assault.
[02:54:36.046 --> 02:54:36.366]  Whatever.
[02:54:36.426 --> 02:54:38.668]  But that's different than exercising your free speech.
[02:54:38.708 --> 02:54:41.370]  Saying, you know, I think this particular group is stupid.
[02:54:41.450 --> 02:54:42.330]  I don't like their leader.
[02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:44.532]  I'm going to parody their leader with cartoons.
[02:54:44.852 --> 02:54:45.452]  That's different.
[02:54:45.472 --> 02:54:45.993]  No, how could you say that?
[02:54:46.013 --> 02:54:47.674]  You want to call that hateful and shut it down?
[02:54:47.914 --> 02:54:51.316]  Chris Cuomo has just shown up at the entire family.
[02:54:51.336 --> 02:54:54.699]  Please put a picture of Chris Cuomo up for the audience at home.
[02:54:54.759 --> 02:54:56.280]  Or I'll pull him up here on my...
[02:54:56.820 --> 02:54:57.800]  Why are you guys out here today?
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:54:59.040]  My little tweeter machine here.
[02:54:59.060 --> 02:55:00.001]  You're here to what?
[02:55:00.101 --> 02:55:00.641]  To pray.
[02:55:00.801 --> 02:55:01.601]  Our prayer time.
[02:55:01.981 --> 02:55:02.281]  Okay.
[02:55:02.321 --> 02:55:04.482]  So what do you think about all this going on?
[02:55:04.962 --> 02:55:05.402]  You know what?
[02:55:05.482 --> 02:55:07.482]  If it makes you guys feel good, you know what?
[02:55:07.522 --> 02:55:10.203]  Come out here and do your riot and you show your respect.
[02:55:10.223 --> 02:55:11.003]  That's not a riot.
[02:55:11.023 --> 02:55:12.123]  And we show our respect.
[02:55:12.283 --> 02:55:12.883]  That's not a riot.
[02:55:12.903 --> 02:55:13.823]  Trust me, I know what riots are.
[02:55:13.843 --> 02:55:15.344]  I was in Ferguson and Baltimore.
[02:55:15.384 --> 02:55:19.505]  You know, we're just hoping for peace for everybody, you know, here, everywhere.
[02:55:19.785 --> 02:55:21.025]  That's all we're asking for.
[02:55:21.105 --> 02:55:26.086]  And do you understand the fact that people feel like they have the right to do this because of the First Amendment?
[02:55:26.636 --> 02:55:30.099]  You know, I think you have the right, but you don't have the right to disrespect any religion.
[02:55:30.119 --> 02:55:32.180]  If it's disrespecting any religion... Yes, we do.
[02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:35.883]  Yeah, but the Constitution doesn't say that... They don't have the right to behead people.
[02:55:35.903 --> 02:55:37.324]  It doesn't say that you can't do that.
[02:55:37.344 --> 02:55:39.986]  We should avoid causing problems in the world.
[02:55:40.006 --> 02:55:41.207]  We're already having problems in the world.
[02:55:41.227 --> 02:55:43.568]  What about the four people that have come from that mosque?
[02:55:43.709 --> 02:55:45.770]  If that's right there, it does not avoid problems.
[02:55:46.491 --> 02:55:47.651]  That causes more problems.
[02:55:47.671 --> 02:55:51.674]  Do you condone the actions of the two guys that came here and went to Garland, Texas?
[02:55:51.975 --> 02:55:52.815]  You know what, sir?
[02:55:52.895 --> 02:55:54.056]  They paid the price.
[02:55:54.196 --> 02:55:56.418]  And everyone who looks for trouble is going to pay the price.
[02:55:57.952 --> 02:55:59.013]  That's a good point there, too.
[02:55:59.693 --> 02:56:00.974]  You look for trouble, you will pay the price.
[02:56:00.994 --> 02:56:05.016]  I've got some pictures of Chris Cuomo up here.
[02:56:05.096 --> 02:56:06.937]  Split screen.
[02:56:06.957 --> 02:56:09.999]  But see, there are plenty of people that are willing to pay that price.
[02:56:10.199 --> 02:56:13.381]  And so that's the thing, there are people that are willing to pay that price.
[02:56:15.062 --> 02:56:17.624]  So what do you guys think about, or do you want to say anything?
[02:56:17.944 --> 02:56:19.705]  So what do you guys think about the actions of ISIS?
[02:56:20.906 --> 02:56:23.527]  Is that of Islam, or do you not condone those?
[02:56:23.547 --> 02:56:24.968]  We're against it, sir.
[02:56:25.008 --> 02:56:25.849]  We're against it all.
[02:56:25.869 --> 02:56:26.809]  We're against killing.
[02:56:29.043 --> 02:56:29.764]  100% up to peace.
[02:56:30.624 --> 02:56:31.925]  ISIS does not represent Islam.
[02:56:31.945 --> 02:56:34.006]  The same thing as KKK does not represent Christianity.
[02:56:34.146 --> 02:56:35.267]  That's how I've done it.
[02:56:36.107 --> 02:56:36.447]  Thank you.
[02:56:36.527 --> 02:56:37.067]  Take it easy, brother.
[02:56:38.568 --> 02:56:43.651]  So there, those are the first two guys I've seen that have been able to come over here, but they're probably just getting ready to walk home.
[02:56:45.532 --> 02:56:49.454]  Yeah, we should remember that the KKK carries crosses and burns them, right?
[02:56:50.114 --> 02:56:52.075]  That doesn't make them representatives of Christianity.
[02:56:52.095 --> 02:56:52.855]  He's exactly right.
[02:56:58.928 --> 02:57:04.011]  The other side is definitely getting louder and more energetic.
[02:57:04.351 --> 02:57:10.955]  And you've got a lot of... You can hear them chanting.
[02:57:10.975 --> 02:57:12.836]  There's a sign that says Love Rally.
[02:57:12.856 --> 02:57:16.578]  Can you guys hear them?
[02:57:20.160 --> 02:57:20.901]  Oh yeah, we can hear them.
[02:57:21.681 --> 02:57:22.562]  I'm trying not to talk.
[02:57:22.602 --> 02:57:24.904]  People are saying they want to hear what's going on, so... Yeah.
[02:57:25.124 --> 02:57:27.426]  Trying to keep my yapper shut for a bit.
[02:57:36.654 --> 02:57:39.957]  So we're now, what, starting our third hour now?
[02:57:40.137 --> 02:57:41.939]  It's 10.01 here in Austin, Texas.
[02:57:41.979 --> 02:57:43.360]  It's 8 o'clock in Phoenix.
[02:57:44.221 --> 02:57:46.423]  I imagine that this will wind down when it gets dark.
[02:57:46.523 --> 02:57:47.604]  The street lights have come on.
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:51.161]  That used to be time for me to go home.
[02:57:51.541 --> 02:57:52.181]  Yeah.
[02:57:52.861 --> 02:57:55.943]  Well, you know, and that was the thing on the Facebook page, on their event page.
[02:57:56.243 --> 02:57:57.764]  I think we might even be able to pull that up.
[02:57:57.824 --> 02:57:59.685]  They weren't planning on staying out there all night.
[02:57:59.785 --> 02:58:03.927]  It had an end, a time limit, a start and a finish to it.
[02:58:03.947 --> 02:58:09.550]  They don't want this to turn into weeks-long, you know, Ferguson protest or anything like that.
[02:58:09.790 --> 02:58:13.932]  They just wanted to come out, have their peaceful protest, and they're done.
[02:58:16.354 --> 02:58:19.597]  Yeah, so far, I mean, everything is good except for the people who are making threats.
[02:58:20.077 --> 02:58:26.822]  Hopefully, it only stays as threats and doesn't, you know, evolve into something hands-on.
[02:58:28.564 --> 02:58:31.766]  Alright, so what do you think about all this, man?
[02:58:31.786 --> 02:58:44.937]  Honestly, I think, you know, how they can just stand for a religion that's been able to cut off people's heads.
[02:58:45.390 --> 02:58:48.491]  You know, that's been over numerous times.
[02:58:54.113 --> 02:58:56.794]  So what do you think about, do you live around here?
[02:58:56.814 --> 02:58:59.234]  Yeah, just for school for right now.
[02:58:59.394 --> 02:59:02.075]  And let me see that shirt you got right there.
[02:59:02.115 --> 02:59:03.416]  I've never seen a shirt like that before.
[02:59:03.436 --> 02:59:05.816]  I'm just playing.
[02:59:05.836 --> 02:59:06.677]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:59:09.601 --> 02:59:18.245]  So what do you think about the fact that this church had the two ISIS guys who came over to Garland, Texas and tried to essentially just ambush the place?
[02:59:18.765 --> 02:59:28.629]  I don't see why anybody would want to be over on that side and support those and stand up for those guys that were going to shoot that that drawing over there.
[02:59:29.050 --> 02:59:30.170]  That's unbelievable.
[02:59:30.550 --> 02:59:32.171]  Why anybody would even stand for that?
[02:59:33.051 --> 02:59:33.752]  No point in...
[02:59:37.816 --> 02:59:40.337]  I just had something hit my feet, like a rock or something.
[02:59:42.659 --> 02:59:50.543]  I wonder if Chris Cuomo is related to Andrew Cuomo and the whole Cuomo gang that runs New York and likes to tell people what they can say and what they can't say.
[02:59:50.763 --> 02:59:51.823]  Yeah, I think it's his son.
[02:59:52.944 --> 02:59:53.684]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:59:59.468 --> 03:00:03.710]  And so the media here is taking the angle that this is a biker protest.
[03:00:06.257 --> 03:00:09.418]  You have the right to do it here.
[03:00:09.458 --> 03:00:11.779]  There you go.
[03:00:11.819 --> 03:00:18.561]  There's people on the other side who keep shining lights over here anytime they see a camera.
[03:00:19.461 --> 03:00:20.842]  This guy looks like he's got a Quran.
[03:00:20.882 --> 03:00:21.922]  He's ripping pages out of it.
[03:00:23.130 --> 03:00:25.052]  Travis, we still have the YouTube stream going, right?
[03:00:25.492 --> 03:00:27.214]  I think we had it cut out at 9.30.
[03:00:27.314 --> 03:00:30.416]  So yeah, they're calling this a group of anti-Islam protestors.
[03:00:30.596 --> 03:00:31.137]  So yeah.
[03:00:31.197 --> 03:00:32.558]  Not pro-free speech protestors.
[03:00:32.598 --> 03:00:33.298]  Let's spin it.
[03:00:33.358 --> 03:00:34.900]  And that's what he continued to say.
[03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:36.361]  It's pro-free speech.
[03:00:36.461 --> 03:00:37.562]  It's not anti-Islam.
[03:00:37.602 --> 03:00:38.683]  Don't let the media spin it.
[03:00:38.723 --> 03:00:40.404]  And they're just going to do what they want anyway.
[03:00:41.365 --> 03:00:42.486]  Print what they want anyway.
[03:00:44.027 --> 03:00:50.312]  Yeah, I think this guy who's tearing the Quran up is the one who's really getting them angry.
[03:00:53.191 --> 03:00:54.532]  Do you support the NLD?
[03:00:55.152 --> 03:00:56.593]  Do you support ISIS?
[03:00:56.613 --> 03:00:58.894]  Do you support them?
[03:00:59.574 --> 03:01:01.315]  Do you support ISIS?
[03:01:02.476 --> 03:01:03.596]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:01:04.497 --> 03:01:09.479]  You're supporting ISIS by saying that?
[03:01:09.519 --> 03:01:11.701]  You're saying that you support it.
[03:01:12.361 --> 03:01:13.241]  This is America.
[03:01:13.281 --> 03:01:18.264]  We support our religion, our freedoms, and you're supporting
[03:01:19.221 --> 03:01:19.481]  Well...
[03:01:34.298 --> 03:01:53.132]  So we've got now there is another hashtag not my America and so this is a hashtag that is it's a group that they're the take on hate campaign and they're wanting to work against that the narrative that this is all Muslims and it's all you know kind of that anti-islam rhetoric
[03:01:54.873 --> 03:02:00.062]  And they say in our America freedom of speech should not be used to trump freedom of religion.
[03:02:00.663 --> 03:02:04.650]  All Americans have the right to worship free of fear and intimidation.
[03:02:04.670 --> 03:02:04.730]  And...
[03:02:06.934 --> 03:02:09.535]  I mean, I think that that's exactly right.
[03:02:09.595 --> 03:02:10.495]  That's exactly true.
[03:02:10.555 --> 03:02:15.356]  But don't we also have the right to live our lives and draw cartoons?
[03:02:15.436 --> 03:02:19.277]  And I mean, that was all in response to the Charlie Hebdo attack.
[03:02:19.577 --> 03:02:27.319]  It's not like we were just like, hey, let's, you know, Americans, or we, that Pamela Geller was like, let's just start drawing the Prophet Muhammad.
[03:02:27.460 --> 03:02:32.801]  No, she did that in response to a massacre that took place in Paris.
[03:02:33.221 --> 03:02:40.565]  We're not going to stop using our freedom of speech just because the people of France, they started cracking down and they were like, maybe we ought to watch out what we're saying.
[03:02:40.605 --> 03:02:47.188]  And all the media stopped printing, no one would post the pictures that they drew, no one would post the cartoons, they blacked it out.
[03:02:47.208 --> 03:02:49.069]  Well they did that at the shooting here too.
[03:02:49.089 --> 03:02:53.771]  They capitalized The Prophet Muhammad, which they would never call him, Jesus the Christ.
[03:02:54.491 --> 03:02:56.513]  You know, it's just a double standard.
[03:02:56.933 --> 03:03:10.523]  I've got a question about Chris Cuomo, and of course his dad is the governor of New York, and I have to wonder if any of them, or his grandfather Mario Cuomo, did any of them ever have a problem with the attacks on Christianity, the mocking of Christianity?
[03:03:10.543 --> 03:03:12.405]  Did they call for Family Guy to be cancelled?
[03:03:13.025 --> 03:03:21.248]  Did they want to stop the taxpayer funding of Andrea Serrano's Piss Christ and these other works of so-called art?
[03:03:21.548 --> 03:03:22.748]  They never had a problem with that.
[03:03:22.788 --> 03:03:24.349]  They never called that hate speech.
[03:03:24.449 --> 03:03:27.470]  So why are they all of a sudden upset about this?
[03:03:30.956 --> 03:03:32.658]  Because it's not politically correct.
[03:03:32.958 --> 03:03:34.099]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:03:34.139 --> 03:03:34.820]  And that's the point.
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:38.984]  The political correctness goes far beyond this clash of religions.
[03:03:39.064 --> 03:03:45.250]  As I pointed out, the real pervasiveness of it is in the university systems that they control.
[03:03:48.413 --> 03:03:51.796]  Somebody put up Chris Cuomo's Twitter page.
[03:03:51.976 --> 03:03:54.038]  Maybe we should send him some tweets.
[03:03:55.159 --> 03:03:55.900]  Don't be hateful.
[03:03:58.601 --> 03:04:03.263]  Chris Cuomo took to Twitter to claim hate speech has no protectionism under the First Amendment.
[03:04:03.823 --> 03:04:06.384]  Maybe we should say something to him right now.
[03:04:06.984 --> 03:04:09.365]  Well, I don't really know.
[03:04:09.626 --> 03:04:10.326]  This is just...
[03:04:11.192 --> 03:04:12.092]  No, we don't hate!
[03:04:12.492 --> 03:04:13.172]  We love!
[03:04:13.413 --> 03:04:16.133]  We want equality!
[03:04:16.393 --> 03:04:32.217]  It's just crazy how there's just such a, you know, two opposing sides where they say Islam is love and peace and all of that and then they have these other super radicalized side of it that is, you know, wants to take it back to Sharia law.
[03:04:34.116 --> 03:04:48.327]  I mean, they're saying that they don't want intimidating anti-Islam subway ads and stuff like that, but you're allowed to intimidate people saying that you're gonna behead them or stab them or gang rape them?
[03:04:48.347 --> 03:04:51.610]  I mean, it's a double standard.
[03:04:52.010 --> 03:04:54.712]  But you're right, when do they start sticking up for the other side?
[03:04:54.792 --> 03:05:00.937]  When are we allowed to not be demonized and when is it wrong for us to be offended?
[03:05:01.556 --> 03:05:01.936]  Exactly.
[03:05:01.976 --> 03:05:08.298]  They can make violent threats, verbal assaults on people, and that's upheld as free speech.
[03:05:08.398 --> 03:05:12.959]  Nevertheless, if you just do parody, that is called hate.
[03:05:14.440 --> 03:05:21.462]  Where's Chris Cuomo in terms of condemning the people who are making these violent threats?
[03:05:22.822 --> 03:05:28.264]  Hate speech is not the same as making violent threats to people.
[03:05:28.724 --> 03:05:31.045]  Assaults should be and could be arrested for that.
[03:05:33.086 --> 03:05:33.546]  That's different.
[03:05:36.968 --> 03:05:46.752]  Well, it looks like a lot of the people left are leaving now, moving out.
[03:05:48.313 --> 03:05:54.035]  I think that that was their plan, was just to stay there for their prayer time.
[03:05:58.237 --> 03:06:00.538]  But the media has already started reporting on this.
[03:06:02.805 --> 03:06:03.766]  It's really clear what they're saying.
[03:06:03.786 --> 03:06:09.590]  Chris Cuomo's saying because 1.5 million Muslims aren't responding, then we can't say anything.
[03:06:09.630 --> 03:06:15.534]  We have to... Of course they are, but they're doing it to be insulting.
[03:06:15.694 --> 03:06:16.474]  That's the point.
[03:06:20.577 --> 03:06:25.300]  Yeah, someone saying a drawing is not incitement to violence.
[03:06:26.863 --> 03:06:27.384]  It's a drawing.
[03:06:27.404 --> 03:06:29.346]  A slur is a slur.
[03:06:29.386 --> 03:06:31.969]  That's why the Garland and Phoenix things were held to insult.
[03:06:31.989 --> 03:06:33.831]  Doesn't make them illegal by any stretch.
[03:06:36.053 --> 03:06:36.934]  At least he's saying that.
[03:06:37.195 --> 03:06:39.597]  But he does say, didn't he say, he said something similar.
[03:06:39.617 --> 03:06:42.981]  Do I have to follow this guy and actually look at the rest of his tweets?
[03:06:44.403 --> 03:06:46.105]  No, I think you can go to his page.
[03:06:46.385 --> 03:06:47.246]  I'll just go to his page.
[03:06:48.328 --> 03:06:50.550]  Having to teach Du the ways of the Twitter?
[03:06:52.331 --> 03:06:53.832]  You don't understand this technology.
[03:06:54.473 --> 03:06:55.954]  Well Biggs, is it winding down?
[03:06:55.994 --> 03:06:57.155]  How long are you going to stay out there?
[03:06:58.636 --> 03:06:59.176]  Are you hungry?
[03:06:59.196 --> 03:07:00.257]  I don't have my earphones in.
[03:07:00.297 --> 03:07:02.699]  I gotta let my battery charge.
[03:07:02.719 --> 03:07:03.279]  Give me a second.
[03:07:03.479 --> 03:07:03.840]  Gotcha.
[03:07:05.281 --> 03:07:08.723]  Just had someone tweet me and correct what I said and that is that...
[03:07:10.057 --> 03:07:12.438]  Andrew and Chris are sons of Mario Cuomo.
[03:07:12.458 --> 03:07:13.498]  They're not father and son.
[03:07:13.538 --> 03:07:15.739]  That's how much I watch CNN.
[03:07:17.520 --> 03:07:24.163]  The two of them, the governor and Chris Cuomo, the commentator for CNN, are brothers and both of them are sons of Mario Cuomo.
[03:07:25.797 --> 03:07:33.441]  It's just weird how these people get in these positions of power and then their spawns go out and keep preaching the same stuff.
[03:07:33.481 --> 03:07:34.701]  Oh yeah, well that's what they think.
[03:07:34.762 --> 03:07:36.022]  It's their bloodline.
[03:07:36.222 --> 03:07:40.604]  That they have that divine right to lead all of us lesser humans.
[03:07:40.885 --> 03:07:42.045]  We have that book in the store.
[03:07:45.347 --> 03:07:46.507]  Bin Laden's favorite on the show.
[03:07:46.527 --> 03:07:49.209]  What'd you say there, Biggs?
[03:07:49.269 --> 03:07:53.691]  They just brought the lights out, so it's not going to get dark anytime soon now.
[03:07:54.514 --> 03:07:55.054]  There you go.
[03:07:55.074 --> 03:07:57.415]  But it seems like the crowd is really clearing out.
[03:07:59.795 --> 03:08:03.096]  Uh, the crowd on the side that I'm able to be on is very cleared out.
[03:08:03.636 --> 03:08:04.317]  Yeah, I see that.
[03:08:04.757 --> 03:08:06.617]  Well, that, I mean, that was kind of the thing.
[03:08:06.657 --> 03:08:09.458]  They weren't planning on staying there all night.
[03:08:09.478 --> 03:08:12.439]  Hold on a second, yeah.
[03:08:12.519 --> 03:08:14.619]  I'm just, it's hard with me by myself.
[03:08:14.639 --> 03:08:18.680]  I'm trying to roll all these wires and... I know, you're doing a great job.
[03:08:19.301 --> 03:08:20.621]  Yeah, everybody gives a hand.
[03:08:21.833 --> 03:08:25.174]  He was in Cleveland this morning, getting ready to protest Al Sharpton.
[03:08:25.294 --> 03:08:25.654]  How you doing?
[03:08:25.874 --> 03:08:26.755]  Turned on a dime.
[03:08:26.895 --> 03:08:27.595]  Here we go.
[03:08:27.615 --> 03:08:28.435]  So, who are you with?
[03:08:28.815 --> 03:08:29.716]  Infowars.com.
[03:08:30.236 --> 03:08:30.756]  Infowars?
[03:08:30.976 --> 03:08:31.996]  Yeah, Infowars.
[03:08:32.156 --> 03:08:34.677]  So, can you tell me, what are you out here today for?
[03:08:34.817 --> 03:08:35.857]  I got nothing to say, man.
[03:08:36.118 --> 03:08:36.398]  Okay.
[03:08:36.478 --> 03:08:40.259]  How are you doing today?
[03:08:40.539 --> 03:08:40.999]  I'm alright.
[03:08:41.019 --> 03:08:42.800]  What do you think about all this stuff that's going on?
[03:08:42.820 --> 03:08:45.961]  All I got to say is there's no point to it.
[03:08:48.775 --> 03:08:49.756]  They told him not to talk.
[03:08:49.776 --> 03:08:50.156]  Do what?
[03:08:50.236 --> 03:08:53.197]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:08:53.377 --> 03:08:55.318]  I mean, what do you think about all this stuff?
[03:08:55.358 --> 03:08:56.199]  It's your personal opinion.
[03:08:56.479 --> 03:08:56.859]  I don't know.
[03:08:56.879 --> 03:08:59.200]  We have a spokesman for the mosque.
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:00.841]  If you want, you can intervene.
[03:09:00.981 --> 03:09:02.562]  You guys can't speak for yourselves?
[03:09:02.642 --> 03:09:03.983]  It's no work.
[03:09:04.003 --> 03:09:04.683]  This is funny.
[03:09:04.823 --> 03:09:05.343]  You're in America.
[03:09:05.363 --> 03:09:06.124]  You got freedom of speech.
[03:09:06.144 --> 03:09:07.044]  You can say whatever you want.
[03:09:07.224 --> 03:09:08.405]  See if you can get the spokesman.
[03:09:08.425 --> 03:09:08.685]  We know that.
[03:09:08.705 --> 03:09:09.265]  This is for sure.
[03:09:09.305 --> 03:09:11.026]  You guys are going against that.
[03:09:11.066 --> 03:09:11.706]  Going against what?
[03:09:11.766 --> 03:09:14.088]  You guys are saying that Islam, they shouldn't be here.
[03:09:14.228 --> 03:09:14.868]  I never said that.
[03:09:15.228 --> 03:09:16.069]  I don't agree with ISIS.
[03:09:17.538 --> 03:09:19.699]  Yeah, fuck ISIS.
[03:09:20.499 --> 03:09:21.479]  Say that again?
[03:09:22.159 --> 03:09:23.119]  I said, fuck ISIS.
[03:09:23.479 --> 03:09:26.940]  But, you know, the protest for me is funny.
[03:09:27.701 --> 03:09:28.561]  It's just for show.
[03:09:28.861 --> 03:09:30.701]  It doesn't mean anything.
[03:09:30.761 --> 03:09:31.301]  Just for show.
[03:09:31.381 --> 03:09:32.082]  I don't know.
[03:09:32.102 --> 03:09:33.662]  Got a lot of people talking.
[03:09:33.702 --> 03:09:35.302]  Do you want to know?
[03:09:35.662 --> 03:09:36.783]  ISIS is a piece of shit.
[03:09:36.883 --> 03:09:38.503]  That guy had the best sign out here.
[03:09:38.543 --> 03:09:40.584]  He said, fuck ISIS, not Islam.
[03:09:41.024 --> 03:09:43.284]  Best sign out here.
[03:09:44.085 --> 03:09:45.625]  So who's your representative that can talk?
[03:09:48.116 --> 03:09:54.120]  Yeah, he already spoke to a couple of media outlets already.
[03:09:54.400 --> 03:10:00.104]  Johnny Yarbrough is asking us to ask them their feelings on Sharia law versus the Constitution.
[03:10:00.184 --> 03:10:04.487]  Do you think that Sharia law should be implemented in America over the Constitution?
[03:10:04.687 --> 03:10:05.407]  We don't believe that.
[03:10:05.507 --> 03:10:06.048]  We don't believe.
[03:10:06.508 --> 03:10:08.229]  I mean, that's all you got to do is yes or no.
[03:10:08.289 --> 03:10:09.670]  That's why they're here, right?
[03:10:09.710 --> 03:10:11.471]  Because our country is green.
[03:10:11.531 --> 03:10:12.452]  That's what people wonder.
[03:10:12.512 --> 03:10:15.594]  So they want to hear from someone who's being peaceful and they just want to know.
[03:10:15.916 --> 03:10:19.158]  You gotta understand, when someone doesn't know something, they become fearful.
[03:10:19.278 --> 03:10:19.658]  Of course!
[03:10:19.678 --> 03:10:21.039]  So that's why I'm trying to ask you.
[03:10:21.359 --> 03:10:24.201]  The United States Constitution gives us the right to pray here.
[03:10:25.302 --> 03:10:27.783]  So why would we want to get rid of the United States Constitution?
[03:10:28.203 --> 03:10:30.144]  Without the Constitution, we don't have a right to pray.
[03:10:30.164 --> 03:10:33.246]  These people are going to jump over the fence and shoot and kill everybody else.
[03:10:33.526 --> 03:10:36.508]  Without the United States Constitution protecting our rights to practice our religion.
[03:10:37.028 --> 03:10:37.269]  Right.
[03:10:37.369 --> 03:10:38.870]  So why would you want to get rid of that?
[03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:40.070]  Exactly.
[03:10:40.210 --> 03:10:40.671]  Amen.
[03:10:41.351 --> 03:10:42.212]  I agree with you 100%.
[03:10:42.852 --> 03:10:44.613]  But I'm saying, you know, a lot of people think that
[03:10:45.359 --> 03:10:48.642]  There's a lot of people who are radical or saying, yeah, you know, that all Islam is bad.
[03:10:48.922 --> 03:10:51.984]  You know, I believe that everyone should have the right to practice whatever religion they want.
[03:10:52.005 --> 03:10:53.165]  That's what the country's founded on.
[03:10:53.626 --> 03:10:56.628]  But you know, I just, I don't like ISIS.
[03:10:57.529 --> 03:10:59.230]  It's just ignorance.
[03:10:59.351 --> 03:11:06.596]  Anytime in society, the less you know about something, the more you are afraid of it.
[03:11:06.897 --> 03:11:11.240]  But the more you learn about and understand it, that's when you become tolerant.
[03:11:12.461 --> 03:11:13.202]  In our history,
[03:11:14.191 --> 03:11:15.271]  They hated black people.
[03:11:16.052 --> 03:11:16.392]  Okay?
[03:11:17.012 --> 03:11:19.852]  There are less people who hate black people today than in our history.
[03:11:20.253 --> 03:11:20.913]  But what happened?
[03:11:21.013 --> 03:11:25.774]  Over time, they learned to live together and adapt and know there's no reason to be afraid of them.
[03:11:26.254 --> 03:11:27.734]  Now they're afraid of Hispanics.
[03:11:28.114 --> 03:11:29.775]  They think they're going to take over Arizona.
[03:11:30.235 --> 03:11:30.595]  Okay?
[03:11:30.975 --> 03:11:32.415]  Now they're afraid of Muslims.
[03:11:32.676 --> 03:11:34.096]  They think Muslims are going to take over.
[03:11:34.336 --> 03:11:35.616]  So this is nothing new.
[03:11:35.916 --> 03:11:37.977]  This has been around in our history for a long time.
[03:11:38.037 --> 03:11:38.617]  Ask him where he's from.
[03:11:38.637 --> 03:11:39.057]  Say that again?
[03:11:39.337 --> 03:11:40.377]  This is just another cycle.
[03:11:40.537 --> 03:11:41.198]  And where are you from?
[03:11:43.177 --> 03:11:43.937]  I'm a U.S.
[03:11:43.997 --> 03:11:44.358]  citizen.
[03:11:44.598 --> 03:11:46.339]  No, but I'm just, with your accent, where are you from?
[03:11:46.359 --> 03:11:48.340]  My accent is from Gambia in West Africa.
[03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:49.060]  Okay.
[03:11:49.380 --> 03:11:50.121]  He said in Gambia.
[03:11:50.281 --> 03:11:50.461]  Yeah.
[03:11:50.501 --> 03:11:51.341]  Gambia, West Africa.
[03:11:51.841 --> 03:11:54.643]  This has been going, so this is just one cycle, like you said.
[03:11:54.703 --> 03:11:54.883]  Yeah.
[03:11:54.903 --> 03:11:57.424]  So another cycle will come around, someone else will be a target.
[03:11:58.745 --> 03:12:03.467]  The Imam preaches all the time that violence is not acceptable in Islam.
[03:12:03.567 --> 03:12:10.651]  So what do you think about the two people that supposedly went here and then the ones who went to Garland and went to attack the other event?
[03:12:10.970 --> 03:12:18.512]  Their actions are unwarranted, and we do not condone their actions, and they should not have gone there.
[03:12:19.072 --> 03:12:25.474]  However, I think under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution that they were provoked.
[03:12:26.015 --> 03:12:28.355]  How do you think they became radicalized, so to say?
[03:12:28.755 --> 03:12:29.576]  We don't know them.
[03:12:30.496 --> 03:12:31.176]  We don't know them.
[03:12:31.256 --> 03:12:33.117]  How long were they attending here, do you know?
[03:12:33.137 --> 03:12:34.457]  We don't know, and I don't know.
[03:12:34.897 --> 03:12:36.778]  I've never met them, and I don't know them.
[03:12:37.418 --> 03:12:38.578]  How long have you been going here?
[03:12:39.299 --> 03:12:40.119]  About six years.
[03:12:40.734 --> 03:12:42.435]  Okay, so out of that entire time, six years?
[03:12:42.455 --> 03:12:44.997]  Yeah, you didn't get radicalized.
[03:12:45.537 --> 03:12:46.758]  But did you ever see those people?
[03:12:47.318 --> 03:12:47.538]  No!
[03:12:47.918 --> 03:12:48.479]  Did you, sir?
[03:12:49.179 --> 03:12:49.519]  Oh, no.
[03:12:50.080 --> 03:12:51.040]  I haven't.
[03:12:51.140 --> 03:12:51.681]  I'm an attorney.
[03:12:51.941 --> 03:12:52.941]  Does he think they were set up?
[03:12:54.062 --> 03:12:55.323]  Do you think they were set up at all?
[03:12:56.584 --> 03:12:59.706]  No, I believe their actions are uncalled for.
[03:13:00.426 --> 03:13:02.367]  Violence is not accepted in Islam.
[03:13:02.387 --> 03:13:04.368]  Well, no, but do you think that someone put them up to that?
[03:13:04.629 --> 03:13:07.010]  Do you think someone kind of grabbed them in a radical...
[03:13:07.780 --> 03:13:09.781]  I don't have personal knowledge of that.
[03:13:10.242 --> 03:13:13.584]  But I know here it's not, it didn't happen here at the mosque.
[03:13:13.824 --> 03:13:17.366]  If they are radicalized, they must have been radicalized elsewhere.
[03:13:17.946 --> 03:13:19.988]  And radicalized is a subjective term.
[03:13:20.048 --> 03:13:22.529]  It depends what you mean by radicalized.
[03:13:23.490 --> 03:13:27.672]  What I do know is that this party does not tolerate their conduct.
[03:13:28.093 --> 03:13:31.435]  Well, yeah, I mean, radical would be saying you want to kill somebody because they drew a cartoon.
[03:13:31.475 --> 03:13:36.498]  Well, we do not support what they did.
[03:13:37.145 --> 03:13:39.446]  That's our job as just adult human beings to restrain and
[03:13:57.953 --> 03:13:58.733]  To restrain ourselves.
[03:13:59.113 --> 03:14:01.994]  If someone's verbally attacking you, you sit there and you move on.
[03:14:02.314 --> 03:14:04.815]  If you decide to take it to violence, then that's what escalates.
[03:14:04.835 --> 03:14:09.197]  There is speech that's protected and there is speech that is not protected.
[03:14:09.877 --> 03:14:13.678]  Speech that provokes violence is not protected speech.
[03:14:14.458 --> 03:14:14.839]  Okay?
[03:14:15.699 --> 03:14:19.240]  Speech that, even hate speech is protected.
[03:14:19.360 --> 03:14:22.161]  But speech that provokes violence for someone to act
[03:14:22.771 --> 03:14:24.052]  It's not protected speech.
[03:14:24.552 --> 03:14:30.477]  I believe what they were doing in Texas was provocative speech and it's not protected under the Constitution.
[03:14:30.737 --> 03:14:43.728]  However, I equally believe the conduct of those that went there, allegedly from here in Phoenix, their conduct is unacceptable and violence is also unacceptable under Islam.
[03:14:44.248 --> 03:14:47.170]  And the Imam believes that, our Muslim community believes that.
[03:14:48.618 --> 03:14:52.642]  Like the guy said, the best sign here is the one that says, fuck ISIS, not Islam.
[03:14:52.702 --> 03:14:53.603]  Yeah, I like that one.
[03:14:53.664 --> 03:14:55.445]  Hey, tell him he should be the spokesman.
[03:14:55.465 --> 03:14:56.487]  He's an excellent speaker.
[03:14:57.408 --> 03:14:58.769]  No, no, you're very excellent.
[03:14:58.929 --> 03:15:00.591]  I don't speak for the mosque, by the way.
[03:15:01.192 --> 03:15:02.773]  Oh yeah, it's your opinion, yeah.
[03:15:03.154 --> 03:15:06.037]  Yeah, I don't speak for the mosque.
[03:15:06.377 --> 03:15:09.741]  But this scene, to me, is not surprising.
[03:15:11.502 --> 03:15:14.063]  For me, it's just for show.
[03:15:14.423 --> 03:15:24.887]  Do you think it stems from the fact that a lot of the ISIS stuff, the beheadings, because they've gone around killing Christians, they're lining people up on the beaches, chopping their heads off.
[03:15:25.167 --> 03:15:30.549]  Don't you think that kind of gets... And then on top of that, we know that our government drops some weapons as well, too.
[03:15:30.609 --> 03:15:33.710]  So, I mean... No, no, protest is nothing new.
[03:15:33.890 --> 03:15:35.030]  This has been around forever.
[03:15:35.050 --> 03:15:36.651]  Oh yeah, I go to protests all the time.
[03:15:36.671 --> 03:15:37.131]  Exactly.
[03:15:37.191 --> 03:15:39.192]  So, this is not the first time this happened.
[03:15:39.492 --> 03:15:40.532]  The events you mentioned,
[03:15:40.933 --> 03:15:44.716]  Well, they're protesting because of the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
[03:15:44.736 --> 03:15:45.457]  I mean, originally.
[03:16:03.066 --> 03:16:05.628]  They're here, they think Islam and Muslims are going to take over.
[03:16:05.648 --> 03:16:09.450]  Well, you don't think, you don't think, well, people are protesting because of the Charlie Hebdo thing.
[03:16:09.470 --> 03:16:09.991]  They are in Europe.
[03:16:10.191 --> 03:16:15.094]  So the fact that, the fact that armed gunmen came in and shot people because they drew something.
[03:16:15.514 --> 03:16:19.457]  I mean, people attack all kinds of religions, but that's where you have to restrain yourself.
[03:16:20.057 --> 03:16:20.618]  Exactly.
[03:16:20.738 --> 03:16:21.759]  We had the Holocaust.
[03:16:22.139 --> 03:16:24.741]  The Jewish people were persecuted.
[03:16:25.201 --> 03:16:27.302]  They were not persecuted by Muslims.
[03:16:27.903 --> 03:16:28.243]  Okay.
[03:16:28.803 --> 03:16:31.265]  We had the Crusaders who were the Christians.
[03:16:31.718 --> 03:16:32.698]  They were not the Muslims.
[03:16:32.998 --> 03:16:36.919]  The Crusaders killed more people than the so-called Muslims did.
[03:16:36.939 --> 03:16:38.059]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:16:38.619 --> 03:16:45.540]  So, people will always have reason to protest, and it's their right to protest.
[03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:49.741]  What we don't accept is provoking someone to act because you hate them.
[03:16:50.441 --> 03:16:52.121]  That's not protected under the United States Constitution.
[03:16:52.141 --> 03:16:54.282]  You're again putting the blame back on the people drawing pictures.
[03:16:54.302 --> 03:16:57.602]  But then you're blaming the people who are drawing, you're blaming the victim.
[03:16:57.662 --> 03:16:58.503]  Well, thank you for your time.
[03:16:59.163 --> 03:16:59.883]  What's your name again?
[03:16:59.903 --> 03:17:00.423]  Abdul.
[03:17:00.603 --> 03:17:00.863]  Abdul?
[03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:04.211]  He should be the spokesperson.
[03:17:06.212 --> 03:17:10.575]  Except for the fact that he said that some people, there's some free speech that's not protected.
[03:17:10.895 --> 03:17:11.515]  That's where he's wrong.
[03:17:12.416 --> 03:17:13.957]  Yeah, where is that in the Constitution?
[03:17:14.037 --> 03:17:15.118]  Yeah, where does it say you can't incite?
[03:17:15.658 --> 03:17:17.820]  And it's like, how do you know what's going to incite violence?
[03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:20.261]  You could say, hey have a good day, and he could turn around and punch you.
[03:17:20.481 --> 03:17:23.643]  Yeah, but I don't think that's in the Constitution, but I think that they did decide that.
[03:17:23.763 --> 03:17:24.044]  Oh man.
[03:17:24.384 --> 03:17:25.505]  Who's crossing the line?
[03:17:32.808 --> 03:17:33.709]  Yeah, don't.
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:18:15.131]  Anybody who just tuned in, you're watching live coverage of a protest outside, inside Phoenix actually, at a mosque where it was a Marine who decided to hold a free speech protest and basically have a draw Muhammad contest, part two, in response to the attacks that happened in Garland, Texas.
[03:18:16.600 --> 03:18:18.281]  And he's being condemned by the media.
[03:18:18.321 --> 03:18:20.121]  Definitely the mainstream media is condemning this guy.
[03:18:20.141 --> 03:18:24.062]  And saying you can't go out and incite hate.
[03:18:24.623 --> 03:18:26.343]  And incite violence by doing this.
[03:18:26.743 --> 03:18:27.503]  That's not what he's doing.
[03:18:27.523 --> 03:18:30.664]  They're making the... They're parting the seas.
[03:18:30.784 --> 03:18:31.245]  Tom, you're a vet.
[03:18:31.265 --> 03:18:32.185]  You need some water.
[03:18:32.205 --> 03:18:36.046]  They are pushing the ropes over.
[03:18:46.693 --> 03:18:48.755]  And, uh, pushing everybody onto the sidewalks now.
[03:18:48.775 --> 03:18:50.076]  You can no longer stand in the street.
[03:18:50.536 --> 03:18:51.276]  Ah.
[03:18:52.417 --> 03:18:56.300]  They're widening the area so people can, uh, attack at each other.
[03:18:56.380 --> 03:18:58.342]  Are there any tank violences in the area?
[03:18:59.402 --> 03:19:03.646]  Yeah, they have a huge military base.
[03:19:03.766 --> 03:19:06.648]  I guess that's Tucson, right?
[03:19:09.893 --> 03:19:11.794]  He said people are afraid of the Hispanics.
[03:19:11.994 --> 03:19:15.514]  There's Hispanics living all over Phoenix and Arizona.
[03:19:15.895 --> 03:19:17.275]  They're not afraid of Hispanics.
[03:19:17.295 --> 03:19:24.377]  What they are is saying, we can't have illegal aliens come into this country and start sucking off the system without being contributors to the system.
[03:19:25.137 --> 03:19:26.797]  And that's what they're saying they don't like.
[03:19:27.137 --> 03:19:29.018]  And they're coming in and getting a lot of free stuff.
[03:19:29.278 --> 03:19:30.938]  They're getting free bus tickets everywhere.
[03:19:30.978 --> 03:19:32.059]  They're not being deported.
[03:19:32.519 --> 03:19:33.839]  And that's what people have a problem with.
[03:19:35.424 --> 03:19:38.686]  We cannot save the entire world ourselves.
[03:19:38.906 --> 03:19:41.929]  We have to get other people to show them the way to save themselves.
[03:19:41.989 --> 03:19:46.692]  And it's not by everybody coming here and bringing all your problems and all your baggage along with it.
[03:19:46.832 --> 03:19:49.734]  Right, and if you do come here, you don't have to assimilate.
[03:19:50.515 --> 03:19:53.096]  Yeah, pretending like, oh, yeah, exactly.
[03:20:03.684 --> 03:20:04.945]  Where's that shot coming from, guys?
[03:20:07.458 --> 03:20:09.899]  That's the Fox affiliate out of Arizona.
[03:20:12.379 --> 03:20:14.340]  Is anybody else covering it?
[03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:15.420]  Any other affiliates?
[03:20:15.640 --> 03:20:17.321]  Or is Fox the only one?
[03:20:18.061 --> 03:20:20.442]  This was the aerial footage we were showing earlier.
[03:20:21.562 --> 03:20:22.902]  They were posting the aerial footage.
[03:20:23.002 --> 03:20:24.843]  So we've just kept the feed coming in.
[03:20:32.332 --> 03:20:35.053]  This has got to be one of our longest live broadcasts in a while.
[03:20:35.073 --> 03:20:40.376]  I don't know when we did the, was it the election or the state of the union?
[03:20:40.456 --> 03:20:41.817]  We did, Ferguson was pretty long.
[03:20:41.937 --> 03:20:43.118]  Ferguson was pretty long.
[03:20:43.418 --> 03:20:44.979]  That was like a five hour actually.
[03:20:44.999 --> 03:20:49.601]  I think it's good though that we do these, you know, at least once every other month.
[03:20:49.781 --> 03:20:54.064]  I think it's good to get out here and do this live stuff and react to things you're seeing in real time.
[03:20:54.644 --> 03:20:54.844]  Right.
[03:20:55.845 --> 03:20:57.446]  We are always teleprompter free.
[03:20:58.433 --> 03:20:58.813]  That is true.
[03:20:58.833 --> 03:21:02.497]  We do have some TVs here, but we're just looking at stuff you guys are seeing.
[03:21:02.957 --> 03:21:07.161]  We're seeing the feed that's going on the air, and then we have a feed going back into the control room.
[03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:10.464]  We can see people eating pizza.
[03:21:15.248 --> 03:21:19.232]  Yeah, they've widened the road and pushed everyone back to the sidewalks now.
[03:21:22.577 --> 03:21:30.603]  You know, I've gotten several tweets, people saying, Joe Antecuzar saying, can't see how there's a built-in hate factor to artistic expression.
[03:21:31.323 --> 03:21:34.225]  The fact that you're drawing a cartoon is not a provocation.
[03:21:36.447 --> 03:21:46.854]  Well, and just like you said, when the artist did Piss Christ, I mean, people were really upset about that, but they didn't try to go kill him or anything, they were just upset that their tax dollars were paying for it.
[03:21:47.414 --> 03:21:48.375]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:21:50.745 --> 03:21:53.906]  Robert Winters says it looks like they're clearing a path for a vehicle to move in.
[03:21:54.307 --> 03:21:55.587]  Do you see any vehicles there?
[03:21:55.647 --> 03:21:58.068]  Any MRAPs or anything on the staging area?
[03:21:58.749 --> 03:22:00.270]  Hold on, let me walk down the road real quick.
[03:22:00.310 --> 03:22:01.490]  I see some lights flashing.
[03:22:04.111 --> 03:22:06.212]  I've got my earpiece out so I can charge the phone.
[03:22:06.473 --> 03:22:06.753]  Sure.
[03:22:09.574 --> 03:22:12.416]  Yeah, they pushed everyone back because of that scuffle that happened, I think.
[03:22:13.696 --> 03:22:16.778]  Because people started running across and into the road.
[03:22:17.794 --> 03:22:21.801]  One officer got hit a little bit, so I think they were just like, alright, that's enough, we're gonna push back.
[03:22:23.424 --> 03:22:25.046]  Settle down everybody, settle down.
[03:22:28.820 --> 03:22:32.242]  So we have our reporter Joe Biggs on location if you're just joining us.
[03:22:32.282 --> 03:22:36.384]  This is our, we're working on our third hour at this point.
[03:22:36.444 --> 03:22:39.425]  We started at 7 o'clock, over our third hour.
[03:22:39.445 --> 03:22:40.726]  We're well into our third hour now.
[03:22:40.786 --> 03:22:44.688]  Just about halfway through getting to the bottom of the hour.
[03:22:45.128 --> 03:22:51.331]  And this is our live coverage of the Muhammad Prophet cartoon contest.
[03:22:51.512 --> 03:22:53.433]  Fourth hour actually.
[03:22:53.473 --> 03:22:54.453]  We're going into our fourth hour.
[03:22:54.493 --> 03:22:55.914]  Yeah, it's like three and a half hours.
[03:22:57.458 --> 03:22:58.438]  There's a, you mean like an MRAP?
[03:22:58.458 --> 03:23:01.800]  Nah, I didn't see an MRAP, but they've got, of course, the undercovers and stuff like that.
[03:23:01.880 --> 03:23:04.020]  But I mean, on both sides, they're doing stuff good.
[03:23:04.100 --> 03:23:04.400]  Oh, really?
[03:23:04.460 --> 03:23:04.781]  Oh, sorry.
[03:23:04.821 --> 03:23:05.261]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:23:27.566 --> 03:23:31.148]  If you don't mind, man, when you get a chance, let me get a picture of what you got.
[03:23:31.168 --> 03:23:32.109]  Yeah, yeah, let me get a picture, yeah.
[03:23:32.129 --> 03:23:33.450]  This is my girlfriend, Lane.
[03:23:33.730 --> 03:23:34.270]  Hi!
[03:23:34.311 --> 03:23:38.313]  This is why we don't let people come to the office, because this would happen all day long.
[03:23:43.116 --> 03:23:45.398]  If you think about coming to the office, don't, just send us an email, please.
[03:23:45.418 --> 03:23:46.519]  Just don't even think about it.
[03:23:46.539 --> 03:23:48.800]  It's much, it's much easier on everyone.
[03:23:48.820 --> 03:23:49.521]  That is a pre-crime.
[03:23:49.541 --> 03:23:52.923]  That is a pre-crime to even think about coming to this office.
[03:24:00.231 --> 03:24:02.512]  Oh yeah, it's definitely cleared out a good bit.
[03:24:02.992 --> 03:24:18.058]  The other side is definitely stronger as far as numbers, but uh... Yeah, I mean there's no need to... I feel like people protested peacefully.
[03:24:18.238 --> 03:24:21.860]  I think you need a three burst of an air horn and everybody just walk away.
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:22.060]  Yeah.
[03:24:22.840 --> 03:24:24.201]  Everybody's made their point.
[03:24:24.221 --> 03:24:24.961]  That's the signal.
[03:24:24.981 --> 03:24:26.162]  But if they want to stay out there, go ahead.
[03:24:26.222 --> 03:24:26.742]  But that's...
[03:24:34.261 --> 03:24:41.068]  We're getting a few people asking us if you're able to speak to any more Muslims to ask them if they have any message for non-Muslims.
[03:24:44.191 --> 03:24:49.035]  That is... Nobody I am.
[03:24:49.055 --> 03:24:52.299]  That's a tricky Twitter handle there.
[03:24:52.319 --> 03:24:53.159]  Hard to read.
[03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:55.710]  James Knox is active.
[03:24:56.330 --> 03:24:57.450]  He's put in several tweets.
[03:24:57.490 --> 03:24:58.751]  He said, remember Rushdie's book?
[03:24:59.111 --> 03:25:00.992]  It was Satanic versus James.
[03:25:01.652 --> 03:25:10.536]  And that, as from what I remember, like the first brush with people being threatened with death for writing something.
[03:25:10.656 --> 03:25:12.296]  At least in my modern memory.
[03:25:12.356 --> 03:25:13.397]  I'm sure there's other people who...
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:19.385]  He was making correlations to where the prophecies Muhammad received weren't from God.
[03:25:20.085 --> 03:25:22.768]  Did that go out over the air, Marcos?
[03:25:22.808 --> 03:25:24.689]  Yeah, I'm on the air right now.
[03:25:25.490 --> 03:25:31.235]  I read the satanic verses and I got looks everywhere I went because people would just read the title.
[03:25:31.255 --> 03:25:32.216]  I'm looking at some things right now.
[03:25:32.256 --> 03:25:33.697]  A lot of them are giving the
[03:25:40.270 --> 03:25:42.491]  You know, biker rally, anti-Islam.
[03:25:44.472 --> 03:26:00.078]  They're obviously putting out the other groups that are against this, kind of going against counter the hate and all that, really pushing for everyone to go to Twitter to try to drown out anyone who might be in support of this protest.
[03:26:01.919 --> 03:26:04.220]  Maximilius is digging the Twitter action.
[03:26:06.661 --> 03:26:07.581]  That's where I see hate at.
[03:26:07.601 --> 03:26:09.282]  The fact that there's this
[03:26:10.157 --> 03:26:18.784]  Incredible hate for freedom, for liberty, to be able to say what you want to say, to be able to go out and do what you want to do, without being harassed, you know.
[03:26:19.825 --> 03:26:21.727]  Well that's the only way their tyranny will reign.
[03:26:21.747 --> 03:26:25.089]  Without having cops storming in on no knock raids and attacking you.
[03:26:25.630 --> 03:26:25.850]  Right.
[03:26:26.591 --> 03:26:31.135]  Well that's the only way that they can push their authoritarian agenda and rain down the tyranny.
[03:26:32.356 --> 03:26:33.137]  What did Rex say?
[03:26:33.257 --> 03:26:35.938]  Smite us with his hand of tyranny?
[03:26:35.959 --> 03:26:37.219]  You know?
[03:26:37.459 --> 03:26:42.623]  But that's the only way they can do it is they gotta break our spirit to take us over.
[03:26:42.643 --> 03:26:45.024]  That sounds like one of the worst authoritarian rules.
[03:26:45.064 --> 03:26:51.348]  When they start telling you what you can't say and what you can't draw in ways that you are not allowed to communicate.
[03:26:52.029 --> 03:26:53.790]  And they use violence to enforce it.
[03:26:54.110 --> 03:26:58.013]  That sounds like one of the worst authoritarian tricks in the book.
[03:26:58.919 --> 03:27:08.952]  You're absolutely right, Marcus, because if we allow them to say that certain things are allowed to be said and others aren't, that's going to be used as a justification to take down web channels.
[03:27:09.821 --> 03:27:12.342]  It's going to be used to take down media organizations.
[03:27:12.382 --> 03:27:17.763]  That's the way they will come after us if we let them decide that there are certain things that can't be said.
[03:27:18.523 --> 03:27:19.884]  Who makes those decisions?
[03:27:19.924 --> 03:27:26.745]  There's nothing in the Constitution that gives anyone the right to make decisions as to what speech is allowed and what speech is prohibited.
[03:27:27.185 --> 03:27:27.505]  Sorry.
[03:27:27.746 --> 03:27:30.006]  You don't have the right to not be offended.
[03:27:30.046 --> 03:27:31.186]  Who will be making those decisions?
[03:27:31.666 --> 03:27:34.607]  You don't have the freedom from offense in America.
[03:27:34.827 --> 03:27:36.508]  You have the freedom to say what you want.
[03:27:38.148 --> 03:27:38.969]  I gotta tweet everything.
[03:27:39.189 --> 03:27:42.671]  No, I was wondering if Watson's up with us watching this.
[03:27:42.911 --> 03:27:43.372]  Oh, I wonder.
[03:27:43.392 --> 03:27:44.532]  I haven't heard from Watson.
[03:27:44.872 --> 03:27:51.456]  Andrew Leibich points out that South Park depicted Muhammad as some sort of fireball wizard with no backlash.
[03:27:51.817 --> 03:27:54.939]  You guys get the camera on that?
[03:27:56.580 --> 03:27:57.340]  Is there a picture of it?
[03:27:57.500 --> 03:28:00.122]  Yeah, this is South Park depicted this.
[03:28:00.182 --> 03:28:02.383]  If you can do the doc cam.
[03:28:06.977 --> 03:28:07.477]  Where are you?
[03:28:07.677 --> 03:28:08.438]  Where is it?
[03:28:08.598 --> 03:28:09.518]  There we go.
[03:28:10.258 --> 03:28:11.239]  It's getting late, everybody.
[03:28:11.559 --> 03:28:12.279]  Oh, fire.
[03:28:12.299 --> 03:28:12.900]  That, look.
[03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:16.421]  That's the Prophet Muhammad as depicted on South Park.
[03:28:16.621 --> 03:28:17.722]  No backlash.
[03:28:17.882 --> 03:28:18.722]  Fireball wizard.
[03:28:18.742 --> 03:28:21.383]  There's Joe Biggs.
[03:28:24.505 --> 03:28:34.709]  Somebody's saying something about 9-11.
[03:28:34.769 --> 03:28:35.550]  I know, I heard that too.
[03:28:43.255 --> 03:28:47.757]  I think the most amazing thing is Joe's just out there with an iPhone, bringing you this coverage.
[03:28:48.637 --> 03:28:48.857]  Right.
[03:28:48.957 --> 03:28:51.178]  And that's what we always want to point out to everyone else.
[03:28:51.218 --> 03:28:54.820]  They're like, well, why don't you cover the Zionist agenda all the time?
[03:28:54.880 --> 03:28:56.301]  Like, you go out and cover that.
[03:28:56.361 --> 03:28:58.041]  Take your phone and go out.
[03:28:58.161 --> 03:29:04.064]  And if you have all this knowledge for something, that really bugs me when people say stuff like that.
[03:29:04.104 --> 03:29:05.024]  Like, why don't you cover this?
[03:29:05.084 --> 03:29:05.665]  Why don't you cover that?
[03:29:05.725 --> 03:29:08.126]  Do you know how much tyranny is out there?
[03:29:08.826 --> 03:29:13.190]  We can't cover it all and it's not our job to stay on one specific topic.
[03:29:13.211 --> 03:29:15.092]  Day after day after day.
[03:29:15.152 --> 03:29:20.318]  I probably don't do as many reports as I do because it's moving so fast and there's so many other things going on.
[03:29:20.738 --> 03:29:23.241]  I would put out five reports a day if I could.
[03:29:23.361 --> 03:29:24.242]  It's just you can't
[03:29:25.011 --> 03:29:33.393]  There's so much, and I think that that's by design as well, is that you have all these fires going that, you know, the fire department can't put them all out because they can't get all across town.
[03:29:33.433 --> 03:29:36.253]  And I really respect people like Bev Harris who just do one thing.
[03:29:36.353 --> 03:29:37.674]  I'm just doing black box voting.
[03:29:37.734 --> 03:29:38.074]  That's it.
[03:29:38.434 --> 03:29:39.974]  This is my, this is my task.
[03:29:40.254 --> 03:29:40.935]  Or the food babe.
[03:29:40.975 --> 03:29:42.075]  I'm just doing food safety.
[03:29:42.115 --> 03:29:42.995]  I'm not doing anything else.
[03:29:43.035 --> 03:29:43.795]  I'm not getting involved.
[03:29:44.335 --> 03:29:45.255]  We cover everything.
[03:29:45.516 --> 03:29:45.736]  Right.
[03:29:46.036 --> 03:29:47.396]  I can't think of something we don't cover.
[03:29:47.921 --> 03:29:48.101]  Right.
[03:29:48.441 --> 03:29:51.123]  They probably still hear, you know, hey, why didn't he cover that kind of food?
[03:29:51.443 --> 03:29:52.283]  Or that kind of attitude?
[03:29:52.343 --> 03:29:52.523]  Yeah.
[03:29:52.844 --> 03:29:54.925]  Hey, I got something on Twitter from Zach Mount.
[03:29:54.985 --> 03:30:00.207]  He asks, were there any winners declared at the Muhammad Art Contest?
[03:30:00.988 --> 03:30:02.448]  Do we have any pictures of any entries?
[03:30:02.829 --> 03:30:05.930]  Well, we saw last contest winner, but I don't think we have any.
[03:30:05.950 --> 03:30:09.412]  Well, they were supposed to declare a winner at the end of this protest.
[03:30:10.332 --> 03:30:12.894]  Travis says when you stand up for free speech, everybody's a winner.
[03:30:12.914 --> 03:30:14.134]  That's true.
[03:30:14.234 --> 03:30:14.815]  There you go.
[03:30:16.462 --> 03:30:17.523]  We're all winners.
[03:30:17.743 --> 03:30:18.824]  Hey, wait a minute.
[03:30:18.864 --> 03:30:19.804]  Is this Common Core?
[03:30:19.824 --> 03:30:27.390]  Yeah, I mean, here's how tolerant Andrew Cuomo is, brother of Chris Cuomo.
[03:30:27.610 --> 03:30:28.350]  Who are they?
[03:30:28.551 --> 03:30:33.934]  Are they these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life, pro-assault weapon, anti-gay?
[03:30:35.075 --> 03:30:35.816]  Is that who they are?
[03:30:35.976 --> 03:30:44.362]  Because if that's who they are, and if they are the extreme conservatives, they have no place in the state of New York, because that's not who New Yorkers are.
[03:30:44.878 --> 03:30:46.158]  How's that for tolerance?
[03:30:46.338 --> 03:30:48.739]  I think that sounds kind of hateful and provocative, don't you?
[03:30:49.139 --> 03:30:50.419]  Right to life.
[03:30:50.499 --> 03:30:53.080]  I love how they're saying, like, right to life.
[03:30:53.760 --> 03:30:57.841]  How does saying, like... Because he wants to kill you.
[03:30:57.941 --> 03:30:59.021]  Beings for life.
[03:30:59.101 --> 03:31:04.243]  When did that become... When you're old and not working and providing a tax base, then he wants you to have the right to die.
[03:31:04.283 --> 03:31:06.283]  Well, he'll want his right to life when he gets old.
[03:31:06.383 --> 03:31:09.724]  And he wants the right to kill half the black babies in New York.
[03:31:09.784 --> 03:31:10.424]  That's what he wants.
[03:31:11.484 --> 03:31:11.744]  Right.
[03:31:11.864 --> 03:31:14.145]  Well, more killed than have been born there.
[03:31:16.172 --> 03:31:17.793]  But I'm racist for pointing that out, I'm sorry.
[03:31:17.813 --> 03:31:18.334]  Racist.
[03:31:19.435 --> 03:31:20.736]  And sort of extremist.
[03:31:23.718 --> 03:31:26.380]  Yeah, people are really, really digging this Twitter.
[03:31:26.420 --> 03:31:27.581]  We should probably do this once a week.
[03:31:28.042 --> 03:31:40.572]  I've been saying, I also want to have a contest where I, I mean I gotta, you know, I gotta run this by the boss man, but I want to have a contest for our Prison Planet subscribers.
[03:31:40.632 --> 03:31:43.194]  I think we should do like a monthly giveaway or something.
[03:31:43.634 --> 03:31:45.596]  Something, one of our big products, I don't know.
[03:31:46.994 --> 03:31:48.715]  We do appreciate you guys.
[03:31:48.755 --> 03:31:54.598]  You really do help us fund this operation and send bigs out to do all this extremist activity.
[03:31:54.618 --> 03:32:03.523]  So what do you think about all these people coming out here doing this?
[03:32:03.563 --> 03:32:04.363]  What do you think about it?
[03:32:04.443 --> 03:32:04.783]  I love it.
[03:32:04.963 --> 03:32:05.383]  You love it?
[03:32:05.464 --> 03:32:05.864]  All right, cool.
[03:32:06.304 --> 03:32:06.484]  Good.
[03:32:07.064 --> 03:32:12.607]  And don't you think that the Constitution says that you have the right to say whatever you want?
[03:32:13.007 --> 03:32:16.169]  And if it offends you, then oh well, just get over it.
[03:32:17.213 --> 03:32:24.196]  That doesn't, that doesn't mean that you're able to go out and go shoot people up or threaten to cut someone's head off or cut someone's head off because you don't like what they said or drew.
[03:32:29.879 --> 03:32:30.259]  All right.
[03:32:31.019 --> 03:32:33.040]  Hey man, I just got one question.
[03:32:33.240 --> 03:32:37.362]  Is Alex like, really, like how he is?
[03:32:37.482 --> 03:32:39.523]  Like, personal?
[03:32:39.583 --> 03:32:43.045]  This guy wants to know if Alex is how he is on the show, off the air.
[03:32:43.585 --> 03:32:44.726]  You guys want to tell him real quick?
[03:32:45.504 --> 03:32:47.964]  Alex is sometimes more intense off the air.
[03:32:47.984 --> 03:32:53.866]  Yeah, he holds back a little bit because it's a family show and he doesn't want to get too angry about stuff sometimes.
[03:32:53.966 --> 03:32:55.386]  But yeah, you've seen him have to.
[03:32:56.926 --> 03:33:01.367]  He breaks the mic sometimes off air and he gets really upset with this.
[03:33:01.587 --> 03:33:02.327]  This is real.
[03:33:02.467 --> 03:33:04.468]  And he has everyday problems.
[03:33:04.508 --> 03:33:06.728]  He loses his cell phone.
[03:33:06.768 --> 03:33:10.189]  I've seen him actually quit smoking and be successful doing that.
[03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:11.709]  He's got everyday problems just like
[03:33:12.489 --> 03:33:27.574]  Everybody else out there, you know, sometimes he forgets to put gas in his car and You know, he's got so much going on So yeah, I mean he's Alex is as you know, I hear people say he's putting on an act He's definitely not putting on an act definitely not what he is.
[03:33:27.654 --> 03:33:29.375]  His entire life is an act.
[03:33:29.415 --> 03:33:32.816]  Yeah, I don't believe I mean Alex is like that even when
[03:33:34.096 --> 03:33:42.683]  I remember we took a day off one time, half a day actually, and we went to Barton Springs, and we were shooting B-roll for a piece on Barton Springs, but that was considered a day off.
[03:33:43.143 --> 03:33:49.829]  And we went and got snow cones, and we're sitting there eating them, and they kind of tasted chemically and funny.
[03:33:51.130 --> 03:33:53.252]  And he's looking at me, I'm like, yeah, it kind of tastes weird.
[03:33:53.272 --> 03:33:54.733]  He goes, let's investigate.
[03:33:54.793 --> 03:34:03.340]  He pulls out his phone, we go over there, we ask the guy for the syrup jar, we're looking at it, and we're like, yep, it has aspartame in it, it has this red...
[03:34:04.645 --> 03:34:07.548]  And then we start preaching to the people who are good at snow cones.
[03:34:07.568 --> 03:34:08.589]  It's got aspartame in it.
[03:34:08.609 --> 03:34:09.589]  You know what aspartame does?
[03:34:10.210 --> 03:34:10.891]  You know how it's made?
[03:34:10.911 --> 03:34:11.851]  It's bacteria poop.
[03:34:12.252 --> 03:34:16.916]  I mean, you know, if this was all an act, he wouldn't be doing that.
[03:34:16.996 --> 03:34:24.022]  He would be having a good time at Barton Springs, but instead he's investigating the snow cone man and what he's putting in the snow cones.
[03:34:24.122 --> 03:34:25.003]  What were you showing me?
[03:34:25.782 --> 03:34:26.443]  Are you showing me something?
[03:34:26.583 --> 03:34:29.367]  Yes, I wanted you to respond to this tweet.
[03:34:30.248 --> 03:34:36.156]  They said if they did not wear shirts saying F Islam, then the pitch for free speech would be more convincing.
[03:34:38.928 --> 03:34:43.410]  I mean, that's the whole point of free speech is you can do that if you want.
[03:34:43.630 --> 03:34:49.553]  If it offends people, that's what, you know, David Knight, you brought this up, Westboro Baptist Church, awful people.
[03:34:49.613 --> 03:34:51.834]  They, I just, they make me cry.
[03:34:51.874 --> 03:34:58.617]  I just watched a video today where they were out protesting a Marines funeral and there, there is a, there is a, um,
[03:34:59.517 --> 03:35:15.361]  A troop of veterans that come out and they station themselves in between the Westboro Baptist Church and the funeral attendees and they block them off and you know that's one way to block that hate speech but you know that brought tears to my eyes because I just don't understand how people can be that hateful.
[03:35:15.701 --> 03:35:16.201]  But you know what?
[03:35:16.341 --> 03:35:17.642]  I don't want to murder them.
[03:35:17.982 --> 03:35:19.122]  Misguided and hateful.
[03:35:19.862 --> 03:35:26.704]  And as one person just tweeted here, you know, point out that you can go to jail for denying the Holocaust in Europe.
[03:35:27.364 --> 03:35:28.305]  Some European countries.
[03:35:28.565 --> 03:35:29.145]  You really can.
[03:35:29.185 --> 03:35:39.293]  I mean, not just for saying it, but if you write a publication saying that, you know, that it didn't happen, they can consider that, in some instances they have considered that to be hate speech.
[03:35:39.353 --> 03:35:40.854]  So, I think that's deplorable.
[03:35:40.974 --> 03:35:43.576]  I think you ought to be able to say whatever you wish.
[03:35:43.656 --> 03:35:46.058]  I mean, I personally believe that there was a Holocaust.
[03:35:46.078 --> 03:35:47.399]  I think there's a lot of evidence for it.
[03:35:47.679 --> 03:35:51.902]  Nevertheless, people who feel otherwise need to be able to say that.
[03:35:51.942 --> 03:35:54.144]  We need to have a clash of ideas.
[03:35:54.504 --> 03:35:56.386]  When you gag people's speech,
[03:35:56.846 --> 03:35:58.887]  Then they start to wonder, well, what's really up with that?
[03:35:58.927 --> 03:35:59.808]  And rightfully so!
[03:35:59.848 --> 03:36:05.111]  That's what we see happening all the time in America, that the government will not be open and honest with us.
[03:36:05.131 --> 03:36:08.533]  When they finally do talk, they usually give us conflicting lies.
[03:36:08.553 --> 03:36:10.635]  They'll tell us one lie one day, another lie another day.
[03:36:10.695 --> 03:36:13.056]  That's why people start doing investigations.
[03:36:13.136 --> 03:36:15.217]  Then they call us conspiracy theorists.
[03:36:15.237 --> 03:36:19.240]  Well, I think we can sum up tonight with Maximilius' tweet.
[03:36:19.840 --> 03:36:22.402]  Popular speech doesn't need to be protected.
[03:36:22.802 --> 03:36:24.183]  That's it right there.
[03:36:24.223 --> 03:36:28.666]  The only cap is speech that could be inflammatory to people.
[03:36:29.386 --> 03:36:30.607]  That's what needs to be protected.
[03:36:30.847 --> 03:36:34.729]  Whether we like it or not, whether we agree with it or not, is beside the point.
[03:36:34.829 --> 03:36:36.110]  It still needs to be protected.
[03:36:36.590 --> 03:36:37.631]  Or this country's gone.
[03:36:38.431 --> 03:36:43.774]  And when our country goes, and there's people working on getting rid of our country right now.
[03:36:43.794 --> 03:36:46.776]  When our country goes, the whole world's going to descend into a hell pit.
[03:36:47.757 --> 03:36:47.897]  Yeah.
[03:36:48.246 --> 03:36:57.775]  And all the little communists running around here that are living in this Western world that love it so much, that love the designer sunglasses they wear and the designer clothes that they're wearing.
[03:36:59.156 --> 03:37:00.998]  They're going to be in for a rude awakening.
[03:37:01.959 --> 03:37:02.199]  Yeah.
[03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:07.104]  Well, that's their answer to police violence in America against minorities is communism.
[03:37:08.085 --> 03:37:08.205]  Yeah.
[03:37:09.511 --> 03:37:16.075]  And even Mao said, I'm going to do a report on this next week, Mao even said communism doesn't work once the revolution succeeds.
[03:37:16.555 --> 03:37:17.096]  It doesn't work.
[03:37:17.456 --> 03:37:18.217]  He even admits it.
[03:37:18.817 --> 03:37:27.582]  All these people running around worshipping Mao and they don't even, he didn't even believe the system he was pushing and wrote about in his little red book that they carry around.
[03:37:27.622 --> 03:37:29.584]  His little red book, he just needed the useful idiots.
[03:37:30.504 --> 03:37:31.625]  Well he could see that it didn't work.
[03:37:31.665 --> 03:37:37.749]  He saw people starving by the millions, tens of millions when he did his cultural revolution.
[03:37:38.769 --> 03:37:39.329]  You know what works?
[03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:40.190]  Local farms.
[03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:41.451]  Local power.
[03:37:42.592 --> 03:37:43.713]  Deconsolidation.
[03:37:44.433 --> 03:37:45.474]  Decentralization.
[03:37:45.514 --> 03:37:46.255]  That's what works.
[03:37:47.115 --> 03:37:55.541]  Yeah, he had this idealistic idea that everybody ought to go back to the land and that I'll be better off for it, yet he didn't have any idea himself how to run a farm, how to grow things.
[03:37:55.801 --> 03:37:59.204]  So that centralized management made it all fail.
[03:37:59.884 --> 03:38:02.847]  There were people that could make it work, but... He probably killed them.
[03:38:03.007 --> 03:38:04.168]  Yeah, he probably killed them.
[03:38:04.188 --> 03:38:04.648]  They had glasses on.
[03:38:04.668 --> 03:38:05.549]  He definitely did kill them.
[03:38:06.329 --> 03:38:08.170]  You know, you read the letters from Pol Pot.
[03:38:08.190 --> 03:38:12.331]  They had kids that survived the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot and all that.
[03:38:12.971 --> 03:38:17.072]  That whole revolution that went on only killed about 3 million people.
[03:38:17.512 --> 03:38:21.433]  But, you know, these were kids who saw their parents killed.
[03:38:22.033 --> 03:38:26.074]  They were going after anybody that could read, anybody that had glasses, anybody that was educated.
[03:38:27.034 --> 03:38:30.217]  And if you were older, they got rid of you because those people knew what freedom was.
[03:38:30.297 --> 03:38:34.081]  And then they knew they could take the kids and brainwash them and make them, turn them into work slaves.
[03:38:34.921 --> 03:38:35.662]  That's not freedom.
[03:38:36.043 --> 03:38:38.585]  That's not a utopian society that you think you're going to get.
[03:38:38.665 --> 03:38:40.887]  And that's what's going to happen when you go that route.
[03:38:40.987 --> 03:38:41.688]  That's what happens.
[03:38:42.335 --> 03:38:46.257]  And that's why we have to worry so much about what they're doing in the colleges.
[03:38:47.057 --> 03:38:56.502]  In many cases, it's indoctrination and brainwashing, especially when it comes to freedom of speech, hate speech, all the isms that they're preaching to everyone.
[03:38:56.562 --> 03:39:02.145]  That's what's so concerning about what's going on in the colleges, because it is a way of social control.
[03:39:02.565 --> 03:39:03.305]  And they start it early.
[03:39:03.345 --> 03:39:04.266]  They start at K-12 as well.
[03:39:05.014 --> 03:39:05.234]  Right.
[03:39:05.395 --> 03:39:06.817]  It's getting earlier and earlier now.
[03:39:06.917 --> 03:39:09.881]  And now it's this whole thing with white privilege.
[03:39:09.981 --> 03:39:12.505]  And I actually took an African American history class.
[03:39:12.605 --> 03:39:14.127]  I learned all about white privilege.
[03:39:14.187 --> 03:39:14.988]  I saw all of the...
[03:39:16.238 --> 03:39:19.921]  Advertising and stuff like that and and there is a case for it.
[03:39:19.961 --> 03:39:38.573]  It's absolutely true It's not just like this myth that's out there, but the way that it's being indoctrinated into the young people is that they are Becoming racist themselves against white people you even have white people hating themselves who are there for this you know and it's I mean, I just think that that's I
[03:39:39.639 --> 03:39:40.379]  Those people are weak.
[03:39:41.420 --> 03:39:42.140]  Don't be weak.
[03:39:42.561 --> 03:39:43.121]  Don't be weak.
[03:39:43.161 --> 03:39:44.102]  Don't be weak.
[03:39:44.722 --> 03:39:46.823]  That's a saying that goes around here.
[03:39:46.903 --> 03:39:47.483]  Don't be weak.
[03:39:47.524 --> 03:39:48.024]  Don't be weak.
[03:39:49.341 --> 03:39:51.303]  That's mental weakness, not physical weakness.
[03:39:51.463 --> 03:39:52.244]  Mental weakness.
[03:39:52.264 --> 03:39:52.944]  Don't be weak.
[03:39:53.344 --> 03:39:53.605]  Yeah.
[03:39:53.845 --> 03:39:56.887]  Don't get pulled into these little psychological games.
[03:39:57.007 --> 03:39:57.248]  Right.
[03:39:57.388 --> 03:40:13.861]  And it is important to understand your history, to understand facts, to see what things are really going on so that you can have empathy and you can understand so that when you do see these protests or a lot of people getting upset, saying black lives matter, you can understand why that is happening and
[03:40:14.522 --> 03:40:19.644]  You know, but don't allow yourself to get sucked in to the racial division.
[03:40:19.664 --> 03:40:20.804]  That is a part of it.
[03:40:20.824 --> 03:40:22.284]  That's what we've been saying there.
[03:40:22.304 --> 03:40:23.145]  I don't know, let's hear it.
[03:40:23.165 --> 03:40:23.585]  Turn this up.
[03:40:23.605 --> 03:40:27.286]  There should be no border here.
[03:40:27.346 --> 03:40:28.606]  The 99% have to cooperate together.
[03:40:42.287 --> 03:40:42.687]  To beat the 1%.
[03:40:42.728 --> 03:40:44.649]  We're all in the same boat.
[03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:47.753]  We're being lied to by central governments and central bankers.
[03:40:48.013 --> 03:40:48.573]  That's the issue.
[03:40:59.464 --> 03:41:02.266]  Good thing you didn't know that first.
[03:41:02.286 --> 03:41:03.226]  I got nervous.
[03:41:03.347 --> 03:41:10.091]  Kushmaster says, me and I say we douse the Middle East in DMT and let them settle their disputes then.
[03:41:30.383 --> 03:41:32.065]  Well, they're pretty much doing that.
[03:41:32.125 --> 03:41:35.467]  They're dropping weapons there and letting them kill each other.
[03:41:35.487 --> 03:41:36.888]  They're DMT, not TNT.
[03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:40.111]  Big difference, definitely more explosive.
[03:41:40.131 --> 03:41:46.356]  I don't recall MLK showing up, guns loaded and saying, F. Whites.
[03:41:46.917 --> 03:41:48.498]  Right, but that was back then.
[03:41:48.618 --> 03:41:56.164]  Apparently you haven't seen a lot of the protests that have been going on now saying, F. Whites and Hammer and Sickle.
[03:41:57.205 --> 03:42:00.748]  You know, who's that guy out there saying whites need to bow down?
[03:42:00.828 --> 03:42:01.789]  We're all going to die.
[03:42:01.809 --> 03:42:04.371]  I mean, it's it's changed now.
[03:42:04.651 --> 03:42:06.353]  The racism has shifted.
[03:42:06.373 --> 03:42:08.194]  It is actively shifting.
[03:42:08.275 --> 03:42:09.796]  So yes, you're absolutely right.
[03:42:09.816 --> 03:42:12.838]  MLK was out there calling for peaceful protests.
[03:42:13.139 --> 03:42:17.242]  Things got violent, escalated, you know, on the other side.
[03:42:17.302 --> 03:42:18.984]  And we're still seeing that today.
[03:42:19.604 --> 03:42:22.347]  But I mean, wow.
[03:42:24.898 --> 03:42:26.819]  When we started today, I had 155 followers.
[03:42:26.879 --> 03:42:28.479]  Now I'm up to 298.
[03:42:28.519 --> 03:42:34.542]  And I think I... Dude almost has 300 followers on Twitter.
[03:42:34.562 --> 03:42:35.842]  I'm really pumped about this.
[03:42:36.683 --> 03:42:37.523]  No, I'm not really.
[03:42:37.763 --> 03:42:38.643]  You are pumped!
[03:42:38.763 --> 03:42:40.224]  It's your first day.
[03:42:40.244 --> 03:42:42.345]  You're new to the Twitterverse.
[03:42:43.325 --> 03:42:49.467]  I wanted to build an account, so when I go to Bilderberg, I can... Well, it is actually my favorite social network.
[03:42:50.188 --> 03:42:52.028]  You know what's going on right when it's going on.
[03:42:52.529 --> 03:42:53.209]  And the people there...
[03:42:54.281 --> 03:43:00.067]  They only got 150 characters, so... You have to be really careful with your words.
[03:43:00.107 --> 03:43:01.749]  Yeah, it helps you, you know, be succinct.
[03:43:01.809 --> 03:43:02.210]  Efficiency.
[03:43:02.550 --> 03:43:02.750]  Exactly.
[03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:05.954]  Efficiency is the... Efficiency at all costs.
[03:43:06.114 --> 03:43:09.618]  There's a great hippie who lives in South Austin that says, Efficiency at all costs.
[03:43:11.309 --> 03:43:16.691]  So Gunnar Chamberlain, King Gunnar, I think he's saying, I think white privilege is rare in today's economy.
[03:43:16.751 --> 03:43:19.952]  Many of us white people have no privilege or pool in America.
[03:43:20.392 --> 03:43:21.032]  Myth to me.
[03:43:21.613 --> 03:43:23.173]  And that's exactly right.
[03:43:23.213 --> 03:43:26.594]  That's why a lot of white people are like pushing back, going, what white privilege?
[03:43:26.674 --> 03:43:28.215]  Nobody handed me anything.
[03:43:28.275 --> 03:43:29.975]  And so that's what it is.
[03:43:30.135 --> 03:43:40.319]  You're going to these classes in college and the university, and they're showing you how the history of it all, you're seeing the historical cartoons and the historical advertising and how
[03:43:40.919 --> 03:43:50.341]  Black people were depicted in television and movies and elections and things, and how that's kind of still trickled through in our society, but you're absolutely right.
[03:43:50.401 --> 03:43:55.543]  Like, I didn't grow up, I mean, at least I don't feel that way, but, you know.
[03:43:56.423 --> 03:43:59.644]  Leanne, I've just been notified, Joe told me he got a text from Joe Biggs.
[03:43:59.864 --> 03:44:06.205]  He's being taken over to the other side, so hopefully we're going to have some interviews with people from the Muslim community.
[03:44:06.245 --> 03:44:08.626]  Just when you thought we were going away.
[03:44:10.148 --> 03:44:13.672]  There's a good quote here from George Orwell that was sent from Rant Reaper.
[03:44:13.712 --> 03:44:18.517]  He says, if liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.
[03:44:18.677 --> 03:44:20.499]  There you go.
[03:44:20.780 --> 03:44:24.023]  I think that goes with the popular speech, does not need to be protected.
[03:44:24.183 --> 03:44:25.144]  These are truths that are self-evident.
[03:44:32.492 --> 03:44:35.053]  Is he walking with that older gentleman that was talking to you?
[03:44:35.333 --> 03:44:39.594]  Yeah, I'm gonna walk over here, he's gonna get me on the other side, and we're gonna go talk to some people on the other side.
[03:44:39.614 --> 03:44:41.135]  Alright, stay in the light.
[03:44:43.295 --> 03:44:46.916]  I gotta unplug this, I gotta unplug my earphones so I can keep the phone charging.
[03:44:46.956 --> 03:44:52.158]  Yeah, hey Joe, why don't you get, do you want to stay live or do you want to take a little break or anything?
[03:44:52.718 --> 03:44:56.499]  Yeah, that'd be nice to be able to get off it so I can start filming, shoot some videos.
[03:44:56.619 --> 03:45:04.581]  Yeah, why don't you charge a little bit, and then when you get ready, why don't we hook back up at 11 o'clock and you're on the other side ready to go.
[03:45:04.601 --> 03:45:05.822]  Alright.
[03:45:06.702 --> 03:45:10.163]  That's right, Mr. Jennings, we're still going strong.
[03:45:11.540 --> 03:45:15.943]  Um, and, uh, let's, uh, let's go to a break real quick.
[03:45:15.963 --> 03:45:18.505]  Did we play, we did play Bounds Other Report, didn't we?
[03:45:18.525 --> 03:45:20.106]  Did we play both of Bounds Reports?
[03:45:20.146 --> 03:45:22.588]  I know Jakari's got a few reports.
[03:45:23.569 --> 03:45:25.390]  We could throw in those, you know what we could do?
[03:45:25.410 --> 03:45:26.751]  Oh, we didn't do the Wolf Pack?
[03:45:26.811 --> 03:45:27.772]  We could do the How Big.
[03:45:28.393 --> 03:45:30.834]  We went through this, we had Carmen, our intern.
[03:45:30.854 --> 03:45:35.358]  Yeah, I'm gonna explain them all and then we're gonna lump them all together and play them all in a row.
[03:45:36.098 --> 03:45:39.221]  And then play a couple ads and then we'll come back.
[03:45:39.923 --> 03:45:46.607]  Because, you know, we've been doing this, we're about to hit four hours, we're getting a little... I think our backs are going out at this point.
[03:45:47.867 --> 03:45:49.408]  I gotta get up from this chair for a second.
[03:45:49.828 --> 03:45:50.889]  It is getting a little hot in here.
[03:45:51.462 --> 03:45:52.862]  A little, I'm getting a little shiny.
[03:45:52.882 --> 03:45:53.583]  I can feel it.
[03:45:54.643 --> 03:46:00.444]  So these are clips from the How Big Hearing where he had to go up to Sandy Hook.
[03:46:00.964 --> 03:46:05.145]  His attorney is Kay Wilson and the Sandy Hook lawyer is Monty Frank.
[03:46:05.165 --> 03:46:08.286]  He's the bald guy in the shots that you'll see.
[03:46:08.306 --> 03:46:11.167]  A couple things about Monty Frank.
[03:46:11.767 --> 03:46:16.428]  He started a cyclist group called Team 26 where they ride to D.C.
[03:46:16.468 --> 03:46:19.209]  and he's a gun control legislation advocate.
[03:46:20.029 --> 03:46:25.674]  So, I don't know if he's biased at all, but he does try to offer testimony in one of the clips.
[03:46:25.714 --> 03:46:28.637]  At one point, he just starts blurting out testimony.
[03:46:28.677 --> 03:46:33.021]  He's not objecting, he's not being a lawyer, he becomes an active participant in there.
[03:46:33.481 --> 03:46:40.667]  The first thing, what we'll start with is him asking for the security system, and then they're talking about, well,
[03:46:41.308 --> 03:46:47.734]  There's a lot of reports that they installed a new security system and then we never saw any video of anything going on in there.
[03:46:48.034 --> 03:46:51.037]  But the judge says news articles are hearsay and not credible information.
[03:46:51.538 --> 03:47:00.926]  And then he asked for the log for people checking in because while Gene Rosen, we have actual proof of this, Gene Rosen is being interviewed, a guy who a lot of people think is questionable.
[03:47:01.787 --> 03:47:05.108]  Behind him, there's a flashing sign that's saying everybody must check in.
[03:47:05.248 --> 03:47:06.349]  Everybody must check in.
[03:47:06.949 --> 03:47:10.070]  So, Halving's saying, where's that log that everybody checked in?
[03:47:10.430 --> 03:47:13.812]  You're saying you have a giant flashing road sign that says everybody must check in.
[03:47:14.392 --> 03:47:15.092]  Check in where?
[03:47:15.152 --> 03:47:17.453]  Check in where and what are they checking into and let's see that list.
[03:47:17.573 --> 03:47:18.814]  Let's see how many people checked in.
[03:47:19.414 --> 03:47:28.258]  The second, he's asking for proof from a school board meeting that there was permission slips signed for people
[03:47:29.678 --> 03:47:29.878]  We're good.
[03:47:45.266 --> 03:47:45.386]  And
[03:48:03.655 --> 03:48:10.123]  The second biggest school shooting in American history is a medium threat and it's being listed as an unwanted person.
[03:48:10.223 --> 03:48:13.527]  I find that really hard to believe and this report's written after the fact.
[03:48:13.968 --> 03:48:17.192]  It's not a report that's being written in real time as 911 calls are coming in.
[03:48:17.232 --> 03:48:20.256]  And there were 911 calls of people supposedly saying there's being shots fired.
[03:48:20.776 --> 03:48:20.977]  Right.
[03:48:22.180 --> 03:48:32.509]  The next clip will go to the explanation of why the lawyer wants to see, why they think that unwanted person report is wrong and been falsified, and they want to see the real report.
[03:48:32.829 --> 03:48:37.013]  And that's when the lawyer, Monty Frank, starts offering testimony.
[03:48:38.034 --> 03:48:46.261]  And then he asked the chief why there's no transcripts of audio communications between the state police helicopter and the Sandy Hook police on the ground.
[03:48:47.462 --> 03:48:55.408]  Because there's a log that they did provide that said the state police helicopter is being called out to assist the Sandy Hook PD in locating people in the woods.
[03:48:55.649 --> 03:48:57.510]  So you'd think there would be communication going on there.
[03:48:57.670 --> 03:49:00.032]  Well, there are none, apparently.
[03:49:00.612 --> 03:49:07.758]  And then there's the case of the dashboard video cams, which Wolfgang went and looked at, and they had no timecode on them.
[03:49:08.839 --> 03:49:15.504]  And they released these dash cam videos on the web with timecode and with the officer's name, but the stuff that he saw did not have that.
[03:49:16.476 --> 03:49:17.617]  It's just weird.
[03:49:18.057 --> 03:49:19.919]  How do you get rid of the logs like that?
[03:49:20.259 --> 03:49:25.643]  Is it that easily falsified that you can just remove it after it's been created two years later?
[03:49:25.903 --> 03:49:28.084]  You can still remove the log?
[03:49:28.725 --> 03:49:33.288]  And then he speaks with the head of facilities there at Newtown.
[03:49:33.348 --> 03:49:34.429]  It's Gino Faiella.
[03:49:35.170 --> 03:49:39.213]  And he asks him if he had any emails between him and Don Hopsprung.
[03:49:39.933 --> 03:49:43.595]  And the guy says, I'm not sure if we have any emails.
[03:49:43.615 --> 03:49:45.755]  He says he's seen them, but he says that they exist.
[03:49:45.775 --> 03:49:46.656]  He says, did you read them?
[03:49:46.676 --> 03:49:47.136]  Did you see them?
[03:49:47.156 --> 03:49:47.696]  Do you read them?
[03:49:47.736 --> 03:49:47.976]  Yeah.
[03:49:48.116 --> 03:49:48.357]  I'm not sure.
[03:49:48.377 --> 03:49:49.017]  Oh, so they exist.
[03:49:49.457 --> 03:49:50.137]  Oh, I'm not sure.
[03:49:50.157 --> 03:49:50.237]  Yeah.
[03:49:51.378 --> 03:49:53.018]  And then they ask him about work orders.
[03:49:53.038 --> 03:49:59.781]  So those are, it's a whole two hour, you know, hearing that's online and you can go watch it.
[03:49:59.941 --> 03:50:01.882]  Just want further anomalies.
[03:50:02.242 --> 03:50:03.563]  It's definitely some anomalies.
[03:50:03.843 --> 03:50:04.003]  Yeah.
[03:50:04.043 --> 03:50:05.824]  Rob, I got to say, you know,
[03:50:06.684 --> 03:50:09.587]  As Montel Williams said, Alex Jones is a fraud for profit.
[03:50:09.627 --> 03:50:11.588]  His attacks on school shooting victims are evil.
[03:50:11.889 --> 03:50:13.950]  So you shouldn't ask any of these questions.
[03:50:14.571 --> 03:50:23.359]  Anybody that investigates this, you know, like a school safety consultant like Wolfgang Halbig, he shouldn't ask any questions of this shooting.
[03:50:24.099 --> 03:50:27.242]  We shouldn't be looking to see who really was behind this.
[03:50:27.342 --> 03:50:32.046]  We shouldn't be investigating the actions of the police to see if they were done properly.
[03:50:32.978 --> 03:50:34.340]  You know, he investigated Columbine.
[03:50:34.360 --> 03:50:37.084]  He didn't get those kinds of false answers.
[03:50:37.104 --> 03:50:41.030]  He didn't get that kind of stonewalling when he investigated any other school shootings.
[03:50:41.351 --> 03:50:48.762]  But, you know, people like Montel Williams just want to say that we hate the school shooting victims if we investigate these things.
[03:50:49.342 --> 03:50:51.584]  No, actually we want to keep this from happening again.
[03:50:51.624 --> 03:50:54.185]  That's what Wolfgang Halbig's profession was.
[03:50:54.245 --> 03:51:01.930]  He was a highway patrolman, he was a principal, he combined those two together to become a school safety consultant and he investigated these other school shootings.
[03:51:01.970 --> 03:51:08.114]  But, you know, we're evil if we look at these logs, if we look at these discrepancies, if
[03:51:08.154 --> 03:51:09.915]  We analyze the actions of the police.
[03:51:09.955 --> 03:51:10.775]  Why didn't they do this?
[03:51:10.835 --> 03:51:11.515]  Why didn't they do that?
[03:51:11.535 --> 03:51:14.977]  We're not supposed to ask questions because then we are attacking the victims.
[03:51:15.257 --> 03:51:19.678]  No, we're trying to stop more victims from happening.
[03:51:19.918 --> 03:51:31.743]  Yeah, obviously if one guy loaded up a hundred pound weakling, loaded up with ammo over hundreds of rounds and going into a school can go in and kill that many people that quickly, well there's something wrong.
[03:51:31.763 --> 03:51:32.243]  Right.
[03:51:32.623 --> 03:51:38.487]  And if that's really what happened, then we need to sew up those loopholes.
[03:51:38.527 --> 03:51:40.249]  And the loophole is not the fact that he had a gun.
[03:51:40.489 --> 03:51:44.432]  The loophole is the fact that there are not more guns on the campus.
[03:51:44.812 --> 03:51:51.157]  And there's something wrong when the government will not answer for their actions, when they will hide and cover up.
[03:51:51.377 --> 03:51:51.697]  Oh, totally.
[03:51:51.717 --> 03:51:52.818]  Stonewall information.
[03:51:53.139 --> 03:51:54.380]  I mean, we're talking about free speech.
[03:51:54.640 --> 03:51:56.341]  We should have transparency as well.
[03:51:56.442 --> 03:51:57.683]  And that's what we're talking about.
[03:51:57.723 --> 03:52:00.045]  And that's a glaring problem with this.
[03:52:00.245 --> 03:52:02.727]  People like Montel Williams just don't want to see it.
[03:52:02.767 --> 03:52:05.710]  They just would rather troll people and make false accusations.
[03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:09.453]  So we're just going to roll these clips all at one time and then we're going to go to a break and come back.
[03:52:09.473 --> 03:52:09.934]  What do you have next?
[03:52:09.954 --> 03:52:13.116]  Well, I just wanted to make this point is that they say they don't want to release the video of
[03:52:13.777 --> 03:52:20.721]  Adam Lanza going in the school and all of that because they don't want to further hurt the victims and all of that.
[03:52:20.761 --> 03:52:27.125]  But they released the video of the Tsarnaev behind the little boy that was killed.
[03:52:27.165 --> 03:52:28.986]  I mean, that was a tragic accident.
[03:52:29.146 --> 03:52:32.188]  They released that video right away.
[03:52:32.208 --> 03:52:33.688]  They released the Osama video.
[03:52:33.708 --> 03:52:35.429]  Why isn't that concern there?
[03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:37.891]  It's just a video of him walking in the school.
[03:52:38.211 --> 03:52:41.712]  They did show the videos of Saddam Hussein and others that they had killed.
[03:52:41.772 --> 03:52:42.252]  Qaddafi?
[03:52:42.532 --> 03:52:42.733]  Yeah.
[03:52:42.873 --> 03:52:44.513]  We got to see his execution.
[03:52:44.533 --> 03:52:46.594]  So they're rather selective about this, aren't they?
[03:52:46.614 --> 03:52:46.714]  Right.
[03:52:47.314 --> 03:52:49.235]  It's only the ones that are going to offend certain people.
[03:52:49.495 --> 03:52:51.495]  There's just certain groups that we're not allowed to offend.
[03:52:51.976 --> 03:52:52.916]  White people can be offended.
[03:52:53.564 --> 03:52:55.186]  Or maybe the ones that they just made up.
[03:52:55.506 --> 03:52:56.567]  The ones that aren't real.
[03:52:56.687 --> 03:52:56.987]  There you go.
[03:52:57.007 --> 03:52:58.909]  Or they don't have any real pictures.
[03:52:58.949 --> 03:53:00.951]  Maybe that's why they're not showing them to us.
[03:53:01.011 --> 03:53:05.655]  These clips, it's about 12 minutes and a couple breaks, so around 11.15 we'll be back.
[03:53:05.776 --> 03:53:11.961]  But people should watch this because this is some really interesting stuff behind the scenes of what's going on in Sandy Hook.
[03:53:12.061 --> 03:53:15.725]  And then we'll be back with Joe Biggs and he'll be on the Muslim side of this protest.
[03:53:15.905 --> 03:53:16.706]  So thanks for joining us.
[03:53:25.960 --> 03:53:37.650]  Did you request information regarding the Sandy Hook Elementary School security system, including the name and address of the contractor who installed the security system in operation at the school before December 14, 2012?
[03:53:38.311 --> 03:53:40.212]  Yes, I did.
[03:53:40.693 --> 03:53:44.676]  Did you ever receive any of that information from the town or the school board?
[03:53:47.439 --> 03:53:48.900]  I received it from my attorney.
[03:53:49.981 --> 03:53:50.762]  And what did you receive?
[03:53:51.195 --> 03:54:08.850]  I received a document, a purchase order, that was generated in the year 2007-2008 showing the installation of a security system at Sandy Hook Elementary School and that's not what I was looking for.
[03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:13.554]  Is there any reason you had a belief that there was a newer security system that was at the school?
[03:54:14.295 --> 03:54:14.955]  Yes, ma'am.
[03:54:16.087 --> 03:54:21.470]  The national news media, all major channels, carry the story the next day of the incident.
[03:54:23.251 --> 03:54:26.273]  Would you provide the document?
[03:54:26.353 --> 03:54:29.275]  If you're referring to a newscaster hearsay.
[03:54:29.815 --> 03:54:31.336]  It's published.
[03:54:31.596 --> 03:54:34.838]  It doesn't matter if it's published in a paper or if it's on a TV station.
[03:54:35.218 --> 03:54:38.240]  What's in the public media that's not credible information.
[03:54:39.121 --> 03:54:43.063]  You testified that you did not receive a copy of the sign-on line.
[03:54:43.905 --> 03:54:50.971]  Referred to on a traffic sign, posted outside Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.
[03:54:51.871 --> 03:54:52.092]  Right?
[03:54:52.952 --> 03:54:55.214]  And the town responded that it does not have that document.
[03:54:56.035 --> 03:54:56.295]  Right?
[03:54:57.095 --> 03:54:57.836]  Isn't that what it says?
[03:54:57.916 --> 03:54:58.797]  Yeah, but you have nothing.
[03:54:58.837 --> 03:55:00.058]  You don't have any documents.
[03:55:00.078 --> 03:55:01.459]  I mean... Isn't that what it says?
[03:55:01.699 --> 03:55:02.220]  Answer my question.
[03:55:02.240 --> 03:55:02.940]  Isn't that what it says?
[03:55:02.960 --> 03:55:05.042]  That the town does not have responsive documents?
[03:55:05.182 --> 03:55:07.324]  Absolutely, but you have documents from nobody.
[03:55:07.344 --> 03:55:08.585]  And you just don't believe that, correct?
[03:55:08.605 --> 03:55:09.245]  I don't believe you.
[03:55:09.265 --> 03:55:09.866]  I don't trust you.
[03:55:16.758 --> 03:55:28.241]  So, Mr. Howden, you're here today because you do not believe that the town has Port-a-Potty records or responses in connection with the signage.
[03:55:29.521 --> 03:55:29.981]  Is that right?
[03:55:30.821 --> 03:55:36.723]  No, I believe the school board has the records.
[03:55:37.143 --> 03:55:38.603]  They have school board policies.
[03:55:38.643 --> 03:55:42.824]  They're required to show expenditure, taxpayer dollars.
[03:55:43.184 --> 03:55:44.545]  Do you have those?
[03:55:44.565 --> 03:55:45.425]  That is outside of FOA.
[03:55:49.251 --> 03:55:51.112]  Let's try to stay focused on the FOI.
[03:55:51.392 --> 03:55:53.414]  I agree, but I'm looking for custodian of records.
[03:55:53.454 --> 03:55:58.058]  The town is not the custodian of records, even though he writes that in there.
[03:55:58.078 --> 03:56:08.568]  Do you have any reason to believe that I was not responding on behalf of the Board of Education, the Town of Newtown, and the Newtown Police Department?
[03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:12.451]  I do not believe.
[03:56:14.212 --> 03:56:17.655]  Through this, item number one says consent agenda, right?
[03:56:21.458 --> 03:56:25.001]  Item number one, on January 23rd... I'm here for you, go ahead.
[03:56:25.821 --> 03:56:29.544]  The first bullet point says minutes of December 17th, 2012, correct?
[03:56:29.664 --> 03:56:30.205]  That's true.
[03:56:30.625 --> 03:56:31.186]  Turn the page.
[03:56:31.206 --> 03:56:32.547]  What's the next one say?
[03:56:32.587 --> 03:56:33.968]  Turn the page.
[03:56:35.669 --> 03:56:36.070]  Okay.
[03:56:36.570 --> 03:56:39.933]  Those are minutes of the Board of Education from December 17th, 2012, right?
[03:56:39.953 --> 03:56:42.194]  Right, that's not what I asked for.
[03:56:43.434 --> 03:56:46.716]  The next item... January 8th.
[03:56:48.697 --> 03:56:52.659]  And if you turn two pages back... I didn't ask for January 8th, but you made me pay for it.
[03:56:55.040 --> 03:56:55.861]  Next page is what?
[03:56:57.504 --> 03:57:03.008]  I think you asked for copies of all supporting documents, and those could be considered supporting documents.
[03:57:03.208 --> 03:57:04.909]  They are supporting documents.
[03:57:05.129 --> 03:57:08.572]  He understands how a consent agenda works in public schools.
[03:57:08.712 --> 03:57:10.173]  I've been the school administrator.
[03:57:10.473 --> 03:57:14.135]  If there's one thing I know, it's how we post consent agendas.
[03:57:14.176 --> 03:57:18.158]  Well, Mr. Kelly, what is it that you actually thought you were going to get when you asked for these documents?
[03:57:18.538 --> 03:57:23.062]  Well, I was looking forward for January 23rd on the consent agenda.
[03:57:23.362 --> 03:57:26.504]  When the board approved that consent agenda five to zero,
[03:57:27.028 --> 03:57:40.814]  You should have seen field trips for 26 children going to the Super Bowl in New Orleans, which is an out-of-state field trip, which has to be approved by the principal, the superintendent, and the school board.
[03:57:41.555 --> 03:57:47.958]  Nowhere on any of those documents have I reviewed, can you find that field trip signed and approved.
[03:57:48.058 --> 03:57:49.298]  That's what I'm looking for.
[03:57:50.039 --> 03:57:51.920]  And it should be on the consent agenda.
[03:57:51.980 --> 03:57:54.721]  And the reason I say that, sir, is because
[03:57:55.450 --> 03:58:03.459]  If you look at the document that he just provided to me, you can actually see a field trip being approved on the consent agenda.
[03:58:04.421 --> 03:58:07.184]  Field trips are approved on consent agendas.
[03:58:07.905 --> 03:58:10.327]  You just cannot find the one that I'm looking for.
[03:58:24.892 --> 03:58:28.094]  Chief Keeho, it purports to be a daily incident law.
[03:58:28.114 --> 03:58:29.555]  Do you recognize it as such?
[03:58:30.436 --> 03:58:30.916]  Yes, I do.
[03:58:31.117 --> 03:58:31.397]  Okay.
[03:58:31.437 --> 03:58:34.119]  Is this an official record of the Newtown Police Department?
[03:58:34.519 --> 03:58:34.759]  Yes.
[03:58:35.159 --> 03:58:35.520]  Okay.
[03:58:35.960 --> 03:58:51.111]  And I direct your attention, sir, to page 3 of this document, which has been marked as Complaint Exhibit C. Are you looking at page 3?
[03:58:52.132 --> 03:58:52.372]  Yes.
[03:58:52.532 --> 03:58:53.353]  Looks like it's for...
[03:58:54.161 --> 03:58:56.522]  Correct me if I'm wrong, sir, but this is for December 14, 2012, at 935?
[03:58:56.622 --> 03:59:01.185]  At the top of the page?
[03:59:01.285 --> 03:59:01.505]  Yes.
[03:59:01.845 --> 03:59:02.205]  Okay.
[03:59:02.966 --> 03:59:04.306]  What is the incident type there?
[03:59:06.247 --> 03:59:07.088]  Unwanted person.
[03:59:07.648 --> 03:59:08.869]  And the location or venue?
[03:59:08.889 --> 03:59:11.310]  12 Dickinson Drive.
[03:59:11.750 --> 03:59:12.090]  Okay.
[03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:14.972]  You understood that would be the Sandy Hook Elementary School?
[03:59:15.692 --> 03:59:15.912]  Yes.
[03:59:16.132 --> 03:59:16.492]  Okay.
[03:59:17.153 --> 03:59:23.156]  Now, there seems to be a list of units on County Route
[03:59:32.512 --> 03:59:35.674]  Looks like there were 22 units that are identified.
[03:59:35.734 --> 03:59:37.315]  Were those all Newtown units?
[03:59:38.776 --> 03:59:40.317]  Newtown Police Department units?
[03:59:42.718 --> 03:59:47.081]  Again, I would object and I'm going to ask what this has to do with the subject of this appeal.
[03:59:48.682 --> 03:59:51.503]  Your Honor, we have requested under
[03:59:55.462 --> 04:00:01.526]  FIC 14461, our Exhibit CA, is the FOIA request dated April 25, 2014.
[04:00:03.008 --> 04:00:08.131]  We ask for copies of all communications for December 14, 2012 from 6 a.m.
[04:00:08.151 --> 04:00:08.852]  to 6 p.m.
[04:00:08.872 --> 04:00:13.255]  between the Newtown Police Department and the Connecticut State Police Trooper 1 helicopter.
[04:00:13.275 --> 04:00:17.938]  Mr. Howell, we testify we did not receive that.
[04:00:19.519 --> 04:00:23.022]  My inquiry is whether or not there is an issue in here
[04:00:30.364 --> 04:00:36.569]  Well, it purports to be a detailed call for service report for December 14, 2012.
[04:00:38.450 --> 04:00:43.194]  And it says 9-1-1 caller, 12 Dickinson Drive.
[04:00:44.414 --> 04:00:48.678]  And Chief Kehoe has indicated that the call type was unwanted person.
[04:00:50.039 --> 04:00:51.700]  So I asked him, what does that mean?
[04:01:01.198 --> 04:01:14.604]  It's a generic term that we use from our CADRMS system, which is a automated dispatch records management system, indicating that this person has not been invited to this particular location.
[04:01:14.624 --> 04:01:15.325]  Okay, thank you.
[04:01:16.185 --> 04:01:20.547]  Is there, Your Honor, I'd like to put this into the record.
[04:01:22.868 --> 04:01:23.588]  Any objection?
[04:01:23.688 --> 04:01:26.330]  I don't understand what it is.
[04:01:26.470 --> 04:01:29.291]  Has that clarified whether it's an authentic document or not?
[04:01:29.821 --> 04:01:33.023]  Well, I'm not sure I would need further testimony.
[04:01:33.364 --> 04:01:36.246]  He's testifying to this official document.
[04:01:36.266 --> 04:01:40.569]  This is a document that was provided in response to your request, right?
[04:01:49.555 --> 04:01:50.736]  It's not a true document.
[04:01:54.098 --> 04:01:58.882]  All right, so may I further want to hear the witness, Your Honor?
[04:01:59.429 --> 04:02:00.250]  As of this document?
[04:02:01.710 --> 04:02:01.830]  Yes.
[04:02:01.850 --> 04:02:02.111]  Okay.
[04:02:03.912 --> 04:02:11.816]  So, um, I'm directing your attention to this 911 caller from 12 Dickinson Drive.
[04:02:12.857 --> 04:02:15.919]  What was the priority of this particular call?
[04:02:22.443 --> 04:02:24.684]  This particular document says it's a medium priority.
[04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:57.890]  Chief Kehoe, to your best understanding of this series of events and the calls that came into your station, isn't it true that the first caller on this day regarding the 12 Dickinson Tribe incident at Sandy Hook in the town of Newhound was that there was a report of shots fired?
[04:02:58.230 --> 04:02:58.711]  Objection.
[04:02:59.930 --> 04:03:02.772]  Let's stick to the whether this has been doctored.
[04:03:04.893 --> 04:03:11.618]  It goes to the issue of whether this has been doctored and whether it's the document that we requested.
[04:03:13.199 --> 04:03:17.721]  You're asking questions whether this is a relevant document.
[04:03:17.742 --> 04:03:19.843]  Now you're saying that there's a change in the document.
[04:03:21.024 --> 04:03:21.504]  We don't know.
[04:03:34.303 --> 04:03:49.109]  I believe that a document which would have been the detail call for service report concerning this particular incident would have been a high priority call type involving shots fired.
[04:03:50.168 --> 04:03:58.255]  The document we have been given through our FOIA request indicates that it was a medium priority and that it was for an unwanted person.
[04:03:59.195 --> 04:04:10.144]  It calls into question whether or not we have in fact received the documents that we duly requested through the FOIA request process, which is upon appeal and is directly at issue in this hearing.
[04:04:10.605 --> 04:04:16.650]  I think we're starting to get to the real heart of this matter, which is that this isn't really about the documents, it's about a belief.
[04:04:17.790 --> 04:04:21.612]  I'm going to object to that testimony by Attorney Frank.
[04:04:22.232 --> 04:04:23.952]  This is about the FOIA requests.
[04:04:24.853 --> 04:04:41.258]  The motivations behind Mr. Halbig is that he is a concerned citizen, and a brave one at that, and that he has, like any citizen of this country, has an opportunity through the Connecticut FOIA laws to request public, non-privileged, non-exempt documents.
[04:04:41.478 --> 04:04:42.158]  And they've been provided.
[04:04:43.459 --> 04:04:44.099]  We don't know that.
[04:04:44.959 --> 04:04:46.720]  You have the document, you just don't believe it.
[04:04:48.747 --> 04:04:52.169]  It's at odds with the facts as we know them.
[04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:57.111]  I'd still like to ask you to put this in for the Commissioner's consideration.
[04:04:57.131 --> 04:04:59.732]  The facts that we know is that 26 people were killed.
[04:04:59.792 --> 04:05:03.334]  Objection to the untestimony of counsel.
[04:05:03.854 --> 04:05:09.577]  You're giving testimony now, and you're not sworn in to do so.
[04:05:09.977 --> 04:05:17.361]  I think that the question was whether you want this put into the record as an exemption.
[04:05:18.639 --> 04:05:25.324]  I do not have an objection if it's being offered as a document that was reduced in response to FOIA.
[04:05:29.268 --> 04:05:30.308]  That is correct, Your Honor.
[04:05:30.348 --> 04:05:30.809]  Thank you.
[04:05:30.869 --> 04:05:34.291]  Yes, Chief Kehoe, do you know whether or not
[04:05:44.428 --> 04:05:49.070]  There are any transcripts of communications for December 14, 2012 from 6 a.m.
[04:05:49.090 --> 04:05:49.751]  to 6 p.m.
[04:05:49.771 --> 04:05:54.173]  between the Newtown Police Department and the Connecticut State Police Trooper 1 helicopter?
[04:05:54.193 --> 04:05:59.236]  Best mine out, there are no communications.
[04:05:59.256 --> 04:06:00.176]  No communications?
[04:06:01.597 --> 04:06:01.937]  That's correct.
[04:06:03.998 --> 04:06:07.460]  There were no communications between the Newtown Police Department
[04:06:08.100 --> 04:06:10.921]  And the trooper won a helicopter for the state police.
[04:06:10.941 --> 04:06:13.162]  The question was transcripts of communications.
[04:06:13.202 --> 04:06:18.883]  So do you mean to say that to your knowledge there was no transcripts of communications?
[04:06:19.003 --> 04:06:21.044]  I think that was your question.
[04:06:21.424 --> 04:06:23.925]  That was my question, but I think his testimony is what it is.
[04:06:24.045 --> 04:06:36.749]  So just to remind you that you're under oath, but I'd like to ask you whether or not you know whether or not those dash cam recordings contain a date signature and a timestamp as well as a listing of
[04:06:37.574 --> 04:06:42.116]  The police car, or unit, and the officer?
[04:06:46.138 --> 04:06:49.360]  Could you repeat the question, please?
[04:06:49.380 --> 04:07:01.645]  Do the dash cam videos typically contain a date stamp, a time, a unit, or an officer's name in the video?
[04:07:02.826 --> 04:07:03.046]  Yes.
[04:07:03.706 --> 04:07:04.046]  Okay.
[04:07:04.667 --> 04:07:05.227]  Can you tell us
[04:07:05.746 --> 04:07:14.412]  Why there was no date stamp or time on the video shown to Mr. Helbig yesterday by your Executive Secretary?
[04:07:21.877 --> 04:07:24.258]  What you reviewed yesterday was a copy.
[04:07:24.919 --> 04:07:35.126]  The best we could do to copy our in-car camera system to a medium that could be viewed
[04:07:36.207 --> 04:07:40.189]  I'm not sure they did.
[04:07:40.229 --> 04:07:41.150]  They're embedded in that.
[04:08:06.314 --> 04:08:07.294]  Video reviewed yesterday.
[04:08:08.955 --> 04:08:10.035]  And how do you know that?
[04:08:12.296 --> 04:08:13.297]  Because I viewed them.
[04:08:14.197 --> 04:08:16.198]  And did you actually see them appear on the screen?
[04:08:16.478 --> 04:08:16.638]  Yes.
[04:08:16.698 --> 04:08:17.538]  Superimposed on the video?
[04:08:17.558 --> 04:08:18.039]  Yes.
[04:08:21.300 --> 04:08:25.182]  Okay, so you did review them prior to allowing us to view them yesterday?
[04:08:25.482 --> 04:08:25.642]  Yes.
[04:08:26.182 --> 04:08:30.043]  And it's your testimony that there were date and time stamps on them at the time that you reviewed them?
[04:08:30.063 --> 04:08:30.504]  Yes.
[04:08:33.025 --> 04:08:33.765]  Are you aware of
[04:08:34.833 --> 04:08:48.579]  Any e-mails that may have come from School Principal Dawn Hoxgrum or her Assistant School Principal for the period of May 1st, 2012 through December 13th, 2012 to the Facilities Department?
[04:08:50.640 --> 04:08:50.880]  Yes.
[04:08:52.961 --> 04:08:57.443]  And, um, did you, have you reviewed those e-mails?
[04:08:57.463 --> 04:09:02.465]  I don't quite understand the question.
[04:09:02.846 --> 04:09:03.546]  Have you looked at them?
[04:09:04.175 --> 04:09:04.775]  Have you read them?
[04:09:04.995 --> 04:09:05.295]  Of course.
[04:09:06.036 --> 04:09:07.136]  Okay, so they exist?
[04:09:08.296 --> 04:09:09.097]  Uh, not sure.
[04:09:10.357 --> 04:09:13.918]  Well, I'm afraid I can't help you with that.
[04:09:13.978 --> 04:09:16.699]  If you received them and you read them, then they must exist.
[04:09:16.779 --> 04:09:17.980]  I would think that they must exist, yes.
[04:09:18.660 --> 04:09:22.782]  And did you conduct such an inspection in 2012, by August 1st of 2012?
[04:09:23.602 --> 04:09:23.822]  Yes.
[04:09:24.582 --> 04:09:28.363]  And did you conduct such an inspection of the Sandy Hook Elementary School?
[04:09:28.904 --> 04:09:29.124]  Yes.
[04:09:30.424 --> 04:09:31.425]  And what were your findings?
[04:09:34.282 --> 04:09:35.623]  What does this have to do with documents?
[04:09:36.983 --> 04:09:41.725]  Well, because, well, we have never received those inspection reports, although they are the subject of this appeal.
[04:09:42.165 --> 04:09:57.092]  If I may direct your Honor's attention to FIC 14-461, which has been marked as Complainant's Exhibit A, constitutes the FOIA request made by the former counsel, Attorney Spinella, for Mr. Halbig,
[04:10:01.184 --> 04:10:13.032]  Subparagraph 5 requests Newtown Standing Hook Elementary School positive substance reports, copies of Triannual Asbestos Inspection Reports, copies of any reports showing lead paint.
[04:10:15.273 --> 04:10:21.877]  It also requests... And the town responded to those?
[04:10:24.619 --> 04:10:27.201]  We did not receive those reports.
[04:10:50.739 --> 04:11:02.947]  Joe Biggs, as he was attempting to go back over on the other side to talk with some of the Muslim people at this protest going on in Phoenix City, we got a text that said, I'm trying to call in, got bum-rushed, or got rushed.
[04:11:03.127 --> 04:11:04.288]  So Biggs, are you there?
[04:11:04.328 --> 04:11:04.768]  Can you hear us?
[04:11:05.749 --> 04:11:07.110]  Yeah, I'm back on the other side now.
[04:11:07.170 --> 04:11:12.814]  I went over there and there were some of the hipster dudes, like a lot of the Austinite-looking people.
[04:11:12.834 --> 04:11:14.575]  The guys got, you know,
[04:11:15.333 --> 04:11:16.233]  Did you get that on video?
[04:11:16.273 --> 04:11:17.053]  Were you recording?
[04:11:42.861 --> 04:11:58.405]  But I was called a gun nut, a stupid conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones sucks, Info Wars is stupid, we all watch Fox News, we're all retarded, everything's a conspiracy, just a bunch of stuff like that.
[04:11:59.865 --> 04:12:04.226]  Yeah, it's a huge conspiracy that ISIS, you're one of their number one targets.
[04:12:05.166 --> 04:12:10.388]  But those weren't even Muslims though, those were just people out there that, the same ones that show up to like Ferguson to start crap.
[04:12:11.892 --> 04:12:17.514]  The people over here behind me that I talked to at the fence, they've all been very cool, calm, and collective, and they're willing to speak.
[04:12:17.835 --> 04:12:23.777]  I mean, they've all left now for the most part, but I mean, everyone over there, they're just a bunch of agitators who are looking for something.
[04:12:23.797 --> 04:12:24.878]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[04:12:25.638 --> 04:12:28.099]  I feel like that's kind of what's going to be there right now at this hour.
[04:12:28.879 --> 04:12:30.200]  Well, it's already clearing out now.
[04:12:30.220 --> 04:12:31.581]  I mean, a lot of people are starting to push.
[04:12:32.521 --> 04:12:40.485]  The one thing I definitely don't want to be is the only one over here when it's time to go and everyone's over there because they didn't seem too happy about me being here.
[04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:44.111]  And you were going there with somebody?
[04:12:44.951 --> 04:12:47.012]  So who was trying to bring you over there initially?
[04:12:48.313 --> 04:12:53.736]  Uh, well the guy who listens to the show, he goes, hey man, he's like, he's like, you want to try to get it over on the other side.
[04:12:53.776 --> 04:12:54.836]  I know a way to get around.
[04:12:54.916 --> 04:12:55.597]  And I said, okay.
[04:12:56.297 --> 04:12:57.718]  So the cops let us through.
[04:12:57.838 --> 04:13:00.519]  And then as soon as we went over there, the people started like verbally attacking me.
[04:13:01.039 --> 04:13:02.400]  Then, uh, some lady came over.
[04:13:02.420 --> 04:13:04.381]  She looked like one of those communists.
[04:13:04.961 --> 04:13:09.003]  She runs over and starts grabbing the cops and goes, this guy's starting stuff, you know, get him out of here.
[04:13:09.023 --> 04:13:11.905]  I'm like, all right, I'm just over here being peaceful saying, Hey,
[04:13:12.318 --> 04:13:13.079]  Why are you out here?
[04:13:13.099 --> 04:13:13.799]  What's going on?
[04:13:14.159 --> 04:13:16.201]  And then it just immediately got bum-rushed by people.
[04:13:16.241 --> 04:13:28.991]  So, definitely not peaceful, but I'm sure tomorrow when you click on Fox News, it'll say everybody over here on this side is a bunch of gun nuts and everybody on the other side was very peaceful, which definitely is not the situation.
[04:13:29.572 --> 04:13:33.175]  And the same thing happened when Jakari tried to ask one of those communists a question.
[04:13:33.215 --> 04:13:34.396]  He said, don't be aggressive.
[04:13:35.917 --> 04:13:37.318]  All he did was ask him a question.
[04:13:37.738 --> 04:13:38.639]  Oh my gosh.
[04:13:39.159 --> 04:13:39.800]  The humanity.
[04:13:40.646 --> 04:13:51.814]  Well, and it's crazy because you wonder if the mosque there, you know, are those people speaking on their behalf or did they just show up and so that's kind of their own personal agenda they're pushing here.
[04:13:53.095 --> 04:14:03.002]  You know, because you thought you were going to go be able to speak to the other side, to those on the Muslim side, but I think that all those people are probably gone.
[04:14:03.022 --> 04:14:05.804]  I mean, they were there for their prayer, like the guy said.
[04:14:06.545 --> 04:14:08.446]  Yeah, now it's just a bunch of people who just want to
[04:14:08.911 --> 04:14:10.812]  Literally just argue back and forth and bicker.
[04:14:11.152 --> 04:14:11.452]  Right.
[04:14:14.173 --> 04:14:16.194]  It's pretty much ridiculous right now.
[04:14:16.234 --> 04:14:17.254]  I mean, what's going on?
[04:14:18.174 --> 04:14:25.617]  Both people making, arguing stupid points that don't really even matter that are just completely against the fact of why this is happening.
[04:14:25.917 --> 04:14:26.157]  Right.
[04:14:26.237 --> 04:14:33.059]  Well, that's why I think the leader of the event already kind of rolled out and the people that were there for the right thing.
[04:14:33.099 --> 04:14:37.281]  And then you have, you know, some people there are really aggressive, but they're fighting with the wrong people.
[04:14:37.321 --> 04:14:37.661]  They're just,
[04:14:39.355 --> 04:14:42.438]  Are people still open carrying out there?
[04:14:44.721 --> 04:14:45.161]  Yeah, me.
[04:14:45.962 --> 04:14:46.603]  You're the only one?
[04:14:47.964 --> 04:14:48.485]  Pretty much.
[04:14:48.565 --> 04:14:51.188]  I mean, that guy took all his people with him.
[04:14:51.208 --> 04:14:54.651]  So he had about 20 or 30 people around him and they're all gone.
[04:14:54.711 --> 04:14:57.214]  So now I'm pretty much alone.
[04:14:57.234 --> 04:14:59.316]  Yeah.
[04:15:03.640 --> 04:15:09.003]  Why don't you give us another shot of what's going on and then maybe we'll go ahead and cut out.
[04:15:09.103 --> 04:15:11.545]  Maybe you can go get something to eat.
[04:15:11.705 --> 04:15:12.926]  It looks like it's winding down.
[04:15:12.966 --> 04:15:18.850]  I don't think there's... Maybe they're just waiting for all the media to leave.
[04:15:22.193 --> 04:15:23.153]  It looks barren out there.
[04:15:23.754 --> 04:15:24.294]  Yeah.
[04:15:25.095 --> 04:15:26.296]  Well, and that's what it is now.
[04:15:26.356 --> 04:15:28.037]  It's just, you know, people that
[04:15:30.224 --> 04:15:31.986]  Might not have plans on a Friday night.
[04:15:32.746 --> 04:15:33.647]  She's still upset.
[04:15:33.667 --> 04:15:41.033]  Somebody said, how does Chris Cuomo not have white privilege?
[04:15:41.453 --> 04:15:44.296]  If his family wasn't famous, he wouldn't have a job at CNN.
[04:15:45.317 --> 04:15:47.278]  Yeah, well that's nepotism.
[04:15:47.298 --> 04:15:49.400]  I think that's called nepotism.
[04:15:49.640 --> 04:15:51.982]  That's pervasive.
[04:15:57.344 --> 04:15:58.204]  No, talk to that guy.
[04:15:58.564 --> 04:15:59.025]  Interview him.
[04:15:59.785 --> 04:16:00.565]  Let's close it out.
[04:16:00.585 --> 04:16:00.805]  Alright.
[04:16:02.486 --> 04:16:04.387]  Alright, so you're going to be the last interview then real quick.
[04:16:04.407 --> 04:16:06.307]  So why are you out here today?
[04:16:06.327 --> 04:16:06.707]  One second, man.
[04:16:07.107 --> 04:16:07.668]  Can you hold this?
[04:16:09.548 --> 04:16:10.269]  Just talking to that.
[04:16:10.329 --> 04:16:11.389]  Are you going to put the earpiece in?
[04:16:11.709 --> 04:16:11.929]  Alright.
[04:16:11.949 --> 04:16:22.593]  Yeah, I'm out here today because pretty much because I got a Facebook post letting me know that there was a rally coming out approximately four or five miles away from my house.
[04:16:23.033 --> 04:16:25.614]  So I definitely wanted to come out and see what was happening.
[04:16:26.349 --> 04:16:28.671]  Um, it's definitely an interesting crowd.
[04:16:29.012 --> 04:16:34.396]  Um, I wasn't sure what was going on as far as like the, uh, the... Oh, shit.
[04:16:34.516 --> 04:16:35.097]  I'm sorry.
[04:16:36.718 --> 04:16:37.339]  Oh, goodness.
[04:16:37.499 --> 04:16:38.039]  What's going on?
[04:16:39.221 --> 04:16:40.442]  I don't know, but people are running.
[04:16:42.603 --> 04:16:43.284]  Are the cops running?
[04:16:44.405 --> 04:16:45.346]  Yes, everybody's running.
[04:16:46.773 --> 04:16:50.034]  I don't know what's going on.
[04:16:50.134 --> 04:16:56.735]  I didn't hear any noises, but people are yelling and... Can you guys hear me?
[04:16:56.775 --> 04:16:57.115]  Yeah, yeah.
[04:16:57.155 --> 04:16:57.655]  Keep talking.
[04:16:57.715 --> 04:16:58.255]  All right.
[04:17:15.874 --> 04:17:17.355]  I don't know what's going on.
[04:17:17.375 --> 04:17:19.217]  There's some kind of squirmish.
[04:17:19.518 --> 04:17:20.899]  They crossed the line to us.
[04:17:34.921 --> 04:17:39.103]  That's kind of hard to tell what's going on right now.
[04:18:04.111 --> 04:18:05.392]  Someone keeps saying tear gas.
[04:18:08.713 --> 04:18:10.234]  I heard someone say stand your ground.
[04:18:10.314 --> 04:18:17.197]  Yeah, because there were some people pushing and the guy was saying, hey, you know, if someone pushes you, stand your ground.
[04:18:22.860 --> 04:18:24.360]  Well, that's about it.
[04:18:24.380 --> 04:18:25.341]  That's the last few people.
[04:18:28.002 --> 04:18:29.162]  Tell that one guy, thank you.
[04:18:29.182 --> 04:18:29.683]  Sorry.
[04:18:34.548 --> 04:18:40.551]  Can you see the group that you went over and tried to talk to who were outing you as an InfoWars person?
[04:18:42.812 --> 04:18:44.873]  I mean, that whole side just cleared out now.
[04:18:44.933 --> 04:18:46.273]  I don't know where everyone went.
[04:18:46.293 --> 04:18:47.554]  There's no one on the other side now.
[04:18:47.694 --> 04:18:47.974]  Yeah.
[04:18:49.535 --> 04:18:50.955]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[04:18:51.515 --> 04:18:56.218]  The event wasn't supposed to be some big pop-off protest, you know, for weeks.
[04:18:56.258 --> 04:18:57.938]  It was just a planned protest.
[04:19:04.372 --> 04:19:10.756]  So now the helicopters flash or shine a light on this guy with his kids, his family.
[04:19:11.117 --> 04:19:16.160]  I guess he was one of the ones involved so the helicopter keeps shining his light directly on him.
[04:19:16.760 --> 04:19:19.803]  Well is that the police helicopter or Fox News?
[04:19:19.823 --> 04:19:22.565]  It's probably a police helicopter.
[04:19:22.605 --> 04:19:23.665]  I'm pretty sure that's police.
[04:19:27.068 --> 04:19:29.389]  Unless Fox News has got a Skrillex concert going on.
[04:19:33.752 --> 04:19:34.632]  This is Fox News.
[04:19:35.193 --> 04:19:40.575]  Yeah, you can see that it looks like most of the people have cleared out on the Muslim side.
[04:19:43.676 --> 04:19:50.178]  And there's the road, you can see the cops in the middle of it, keeping everybody on each side, keeping the sides divided.
[04:19:50.198 --> 04:19:51.439]  What is that big moving stick?
[04:19:51.639 --> 04:19:52.279]  What was that?
[04:19:52.499 --> 04:19:53.059]  Did you see that?
[04:19:54.980 --> 04:19:58.161]  It was like a light pole, but it was blocked.
[04:19:58.941 --> 04:19:59.222]  What?
[04:20:00.022 --> 04:20:02.783]  Yeah, it was right there on the corner of the screen.
[04:20:05.410 --> 04:20:06.070]  Well, it's clearing out.
[04:20:06.090 --> 04:20:07.250]  We'll have to see it on the replay.
[04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:14.612]  Alright, Biggs, are you signing off?
[04:20:14.972 --> 04:20:16.112]  You think you're ready to sign off?
[04:20:16.152 --> 04:20:18.873]  Yeah, we might as well.
[04:20:18.933 --> 04:20:20.673]  I mean, it's already clearing out now at this point.
[04:20:20.733 --> 04:20:21.933]  Everyone's starting to walk off.
[04:20:22.013 --> 04:20:26.234]  I mean, there's like five people on the other side right now.
[04:20:26.634 --> 04:20:31.816]  Yeah, I think it's just going to devolve into... You can only scream so much at these events where you get tired.
[04:20:32.056 --> 04:20:32.296]  Right.
[04:20:32.776 --> 04:20:33.876]  Especially if you don't have a megaphone.
[04:20:37.196 --> 04:20:42.438]  Well let us know if you're able to speak to anyone else while you're there or any other reports you're uploading.
[04:20:42.498 --> 04:20:43.058]  Hold on.
[04:20:45.139 --> 04:20:46.240]  Look who came out to protest.
[04:20:46.260 --> 04:20:46.920]  These little puppies.
[04:20:47.580 --> 04:20:48.180]  Puppies.
[04:20:48.200 --> 04:20:49.581]  Protest puppies.
[04:20:50.361 --> 04:20:51.182]  Those are cute.
[04:20:51.342 --> 04:20:52.002]  Protest pup.
[04:20:52.042 --> 04:20:53.603]  Let me see them.
[04:20:53.643 --> 04:20:54.743]  What's this guy's name?
[04:20:55.163 --> 04:20:56.124]  Hansel and Gretel.
[04:21:07.540 --> 04:21:08.521]  I need some puppies like that.
[04:21:08.541 --> 04:21:09.001]  That's cool.
[04:21:09.241 --> 04:21:11.263]  What kind of gun is that?
[04:21:11.703 --> 04:21:16.007]  This is a Perfectus AR-15 made by Head Down Rifles.
[04:21:16.087 --> 04:21:16.607]  It's pretty awesome.
[04:21:16.627 --> 04:21:18.148]  Why do I have guns?
[04:21:18.168 --> 04:21:19.349]  Because you're allowed to carry.
[04:21:19.970 --> 04:21:22.032]  I know, like, for what?
[04:21:23.072 --> 04:21:25.534]  They said on the news that they might burn down the church.
[04:21:25.935 --> 04:21:26.615]  They said what now?
[04:21:26.795 --> 04:21:28.817]  On the news that they might burn down the church.
[04:21:28.857 --> 04:21:29.137]  Who?
[04:21:29.818 --> 04:21:30.819]  I don't know, maybe a person.
[04:21:31.559 --> 04:21:31.939]  Oh, okay.
[04:21:33.321 --> 04:21:34.201]  Educate them, Biggs.
[04:21:34.461 --> 04:21:34.982]  Educate them.
[04:21:35.737 --> 04:21:35.977]  No.
[04:21:36.617 --> 04:21:39.819]  Well, you guys be safe out here.
[04:21:40.339 --> 04:21:40.659]  Do what?
[04:21:41.980 --> 04:21:43.140]  No, there was no guns.
[04:21:43.280 --> 04:21:44.641]  It's a peaceful protest.
[04:21:45.921 --> 04:21:48.642]  They were exercising their first and second amendments.
[04:21:49.703 --> 04:21:51.723]  No, he doesn't.
[04:21:52.684 --> 04:21:53.624]  Can you still hear us, Biggs?
[04:21:54.104 --> 04:21:54.965]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:21:55.045 --> 04:21:56.245]  I just don't have my earpiece in.
[04:21:56.285 --> 04:21:57.366]  I just got the phone close.
[04:21:57.706 --> 04:21:58.206]  Oh, gotcha.
[04:21:58.406 --> 04:21:58.666]  Okay.
[04:21:59.106 --> 04:21:59.587]  Yeah.
[04:22:00.267 --> 04:22:03.088]  I'm trying to walk off and try to get back because
[04:22:03.857 --> 04:22:06.159]  If it clears out and I'm here by myself, I'm a big target.
[04:22:07.499 --> 04:22:07.820]  Yeah.
[04:22:11.582 --> 04:22:13.223]  Well, so what's the plan next?
[04:22:13.283 --> 04:22:15.485]  Are you going to try and talk to anyone else while you're there?
[04:22:15.545 --> 04:22:16.946]  And then when are you flying out?
[04:22:17.526 --> 04:22:22.049]  Well, I'm not going to put that information out, but it's going to be tomorrow.
[04:22:22.089 --> 04:22:23.350]  What flight are you on?
[04:22:23.370 --> 04:22:25.992]  I know where he's going.
[04:22:26.312 --> 04:22:33.577]  Some creepy guy was tweeting me today, like he was stalking my flights and trying to find what flight I was on.
[04:22:34.522 --> 04:22:35.563]  Yeah, I guess it's true.
[04:22:35.623 --> 04:22:44.510]  I mean, you're not as far as that Marine there that's going into hiding, but... Well... The cops are obsessed with flashing this guy.
[04:22:45.871 --> 04:22:47.192]  The guy with the dogs, right?
[04:22:47.392 --> 04:22:47.972]  Was that the guy?
[04:22:48.673 --> 04:22:48.913]  Yeah.
[04:22:49.173 --> 04:22:49.453]  Yeah.
[04:22:51.175 --> 04:22:54.297]  I guess the guy with his two sons and three puppies is a threat.
[04:22:54.477 --> 04:22:54.738]  Yeah.
[04:22:56.079 --> 04:22:56.879]  Puppy protest.
[04:22:58.560 --> 04:23:01.663]  Hey, how's it going?
[04:23:03.143 --> 04:23:04.364]  How you doing?
[04:23:04.504 --> 04:23:06.005]  Can I just ask about this?
[04:23:06.065 --> 04:23:08.206]  Because I saw you... Oh, okay!
[04:23:08.226 --> 04:23:11.407]  So is that just like a... Yeah, it's Skype and we're live right now.
[04:23:11.427 --> 04:23:12.488]  This is out of Austin, Texas.
[04:23:12.648 --> 04:23:13.068]  Oh, nice!
[04:23:13.208 --> 04:23:14.769]  So everyone's... Is that where you're from?
[04:23:15.329 --> 04:23:15.570]  Yeah.
[04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:17.711]  Oh, yeah?
[04:23:17.731 --> 04:23:17.851]  Yep.
[04:23:17.871 --> 04:23:21.032]  You guys have a good night.
[04:23:21.513 --> 04:23:22.633]  He's making his way around.
[04:23:23.254 --> 04:23:25.855]  People are always amazed by... The selfie stick?
[04:23:26.075 --> 04:23:28.536]  We can do so much with this little setup that we have.
[04:23:28.716 --> 04:23:29.017]  Yeah.
[04:23:30.097 --> 04:23:31.458]  The power of the selfie stick.
[04:23:32.352 --> 04:23:32.652]  Yeah.
[04:23:33.233 --> 04:23:37.415]  Yeah, I used to hate those things until I learned that we could actually utilize them here at work.
[04:23:37.956 --> 04:23:39.237]  What are you talking about?
[04:23:39.377 --> 04:23:41.398]  It's not just for taking selfies, Biggs.
[04:23:42.299 --> 04:23:42.779]  Negative.
[04:23:42.799 --> 04:23:43.860]  That's the whole purpose.
[04:23:46.281 --> 04:23:46.922]  It makes it easier.
[04:23:46.962 --> 04:23:47.782]  My arm doesn't cramp.
[04:23:47.802 --> 04:23:48.963]  I don't have to hold my phone out.
[04:23:50.504 --> 04:24:01.872]  Well, hey, Biggs, I would say maybe get some food to eat and maybe do a little after action report for tomorrow, because this is all... You came in at about the two and a half hour mark of the whole show.
[04:24:03.046 --> 04:24:04.206]  You're with us for about two hours.
[04:24:04.446 --> 04:24:08.567]  I guess we missed all the good, the one good spot when, uh, when you were going over there.
[04:24:10.228 --> 04:24:10.588]  That's all.
[04:24:10.608 --> 04:24:11.108]  That's all.
[04:24:11.148 --> 04:24:12.508]  Every time we go to break, that's what happens.
[04:24:12.729 --> 04:24:13.029]  Yeah.
[04:24:13.949 --> 04:24:16.470]  I have a feeling that there'll be many more events like this, so.
[04:24:16.770 --> 04:24:17.090]  Oh yeah.
[04:24:17.350 --> 04:24:17.610]  Yeah.
[04:24:17.630 --> 04:24:20.110]  All right.
[04:24:20.170 --> 04:24:21.891]  Well, Biggs, you stay safe.
[04:24:22.511 --> 04:24:26.072]  Um, just give us a report later, later tonight after you get some food.
[04:24:26.092 --> 04:24:29.673]  Somebody, somebody in the studio needs to be monitoring this until I get back to the car.
[04:24:30.376 --> 04:24:31.837]  Yeah, well I think we're gonna do that.
[04:24:31.877 --> 04:24:32.658]  We'll keep you live.
[04:24:32.738 --> 04:24:33.459]  We'll keep you live.
[04:24:33.499 --> 04:24:36.601]  In fact, we could just keep you live and let you take us out.
[04:24:37.962 --> 04:24:38.583]  You wanna do that?
[04:24:38.603 --> 04:24:45.849]  Well, I don't want it to be live because I don't want someone watching on the other side that doesn't like us to be sitting there going like, okay, I know where that is.
[04:24:49.051 --> 04:24:51.593]  Biggs, you're a conspiracy theorist, Biggs.
[04:24:51.613 --> 04:24:53.075]  You have become one.
[04:24:53.555 --> 04:24:56.718]  No, I'm a combat survivor and I know what it takes to survive.
[04:24:59.068 --> 04:25:02.549]  Alright, we'll sign you off now and then we'll close out the show.
[04:25:03.169 --> 04:25:06.189]  Stay safe and we'll see you, I guess you're going to be in Baltimore next.
[04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:08.470]  Yes, indeed.
[04:25:08.490 --> 04:25:09.130]  Tomorrow night.
[04:25:10.650 --> 04:25:11.830]  Or at some point in time.
[04:25:12.130 --> 04:25:13.451]  At some point in the future.
[04:25:14.411 --> 04:25:14.991]  Possibly.
[04:25:15.831 --> 04:25:23.153]  Sometime, possibly, maybe, within the next 48 hours I could be back on the East Coast again.
[04:25:23.673 --> 04:25:25.153]  What's your plan in Baltimore?
[04:25:27.806 --> 04:25:37.269]  To go to North and Penn, the area that Jakari and I were at last time, that seems to be the kind of focal point, the main area where a lot of stuff has been happening.
[04:25:38.310 --> 04:25:38.550]  Yeah.
[04:25:39.250 --> 04:25:42.411]  Why do you think it was so different there in Baltimore versus Cleveland?
[04:25:43.711 --> 04:25:45.212]  Because the community came together.
[04:25:45.292 --> 04:25:49.313]  I mean, the community really cares.
[04:25:49.353 --> 04:25:57.036]  I mean, the fact that every religious leader in that town came out there and held hand in hand, usually
[04:25:57.560 --> 04:26:03.404]  Religions that you wouldn't see, you know, talking that much around and then kind of coming together.
[04:26:03.444 --> 04:26:03.984]  So why not?
[04:26:04.025 --> 04:26:08.007]  I mean, yeah, when you act that way, that's the kind of reaction you're going to get.
[04:26:08.027 --> 04:26:21.917]  You're going to have people act, uh, rational and have, uh, more, uh, more of a respect for what's going on when they, when they can tell that the community cares, you know, people went out and protested, but everything remained calm.
[04:26:21.997 --> 04:26:25.860]  I mean, Cleveland, Cleveland, no, I'm talking about in Cleveland.
[04:26:26.180 --> 04:26:26.260]  Oh,
[04:26:26.860 --> 04:26:30.783]  So in Cleveland, you know, they, they, they handed, they handled everything a lot better.
[04:26:32.324 --> 04:26:32.504]  Hmm.
[04:26:32.925 --> 04:26:33.145]  Yeah.
[04:26:34.006 --> 04:26:35.867]  Didn't seem to be any outside agitators.
[04:26:37.468 --> 04:26:42.152]  I mean, there was the Revcom guys were there, but I mean, they couldn't get the support.
[04:26:43.413 --> 04:26:46.796]  I think, I think Cleveland likes their sports more than they like anything else.
[04:26:47.636 --> 04:26:56.083]  You know, the fact that the Cavaliers are about to, now that the Cavaliers are going into the championship, I don't think they are going to waste their time rioting.
[04:26:56.601 --> 04:26:59.626]  When their sports team is finally going to go to the playoffs.
[04:27:00.086 --> 04:27:01.108]  I thought they got eliminated.
[04:27:01.268 --> 04:27:01.609]  Yeah.
[04:27:02.430 --> 04:27:03.472]  No, the Cavs are in.
[04:27:03.552 --> 04:27:03.912]  Really?
[04:27:03.952 --> 04:27:04.633]  I thought they lost.
[04:27:04.734 --> 04:27:08.059]  No.
[04:27:08.519 --> 04:27:08.900]  Oh, you're good.
[04:27:11.311 --> 04:27:17.114]  Alright, well Joe Biggs, thank you for sacrificing being out there on the front lines of the Info War.
[04:27:17.374 --> 04:27:20.915]  We appreciate what you're doing out there and we'll see you in Baltimore.
[04:27:22.176 --> 04:27:23.797]  And I guess that's about it.
[04:27:23.957 --> 04:27:25.117]  I think we're going to wrap it up here.
[04:27:25.177 --> 04:27:28.939]  Let's go ahead and take Joe off so nobody sees where he's going.
[04:27:30.380 --> 04:27:37.123]  And then stay, Mr. Jennings, you can just stay on there until he gets in his car just so we know he's okay.
[04:27:38.453 --> 04:27:40.055]  And I guess we'll wrap it up.
[04:27:40.095 --> 04:27:42.899]  We're coming in at four and a half hours of broadcast.
[04:27:43.100 --> 04:27:46.505]  It's been quite an event.
[04:27:48.387 --> 04:27:48.888]  Very interesting.
[04:27:48.908 --> 04:27:52.914]  I didn't think we'd be on this long, but I thought we were going to roll out about 930.
[04:27:53.354 --> 04:27:54.436]  Two hours later, here we are.
[04:27:55.936 --> 04:27:57.558]  Well, I think it was pretty interesting.
[04:27:57.578 --> 04:28:01.402]  It'll be interesting to see how, you know, the media covers it tomorrow.
[04:28:01.462 --> 04:28:02.644]  You guys were all there.
[04:28:02.724 --> 04:28:07.289]  You watched it live so you can see for yourself what exactly was happening.
[04:28:07.309 --> 04:28:13.176]  You're not just going to get the bits and pieces that some other news outlets might want to give you that spin.
[04:28:13.496 --> 04:28:16.418]  And if you're not watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, what are you waiting for?

[04:28:21.321 --> 04:28:22.642]  It's a monthly fee.
[04:28:22.682 --> 04:28:25.304]  It's a subscription site, but it pays for everything we do here.
[04:28:25.504 --> 04:28:29.126]  And you can share your username and password with up to 20 people.
[04:28:29.666 --> 04:28:33.289]  I don't know of any other subscription site that lets you do that, but we do it here.
[04:28:33.729 --> 04:28:35.830]  And it's because we're more interested in getting the word out.
[04:28:35.890 --> 04:28:38.252]  We just need a little bit of cost to cover the bandwidth.
[04:28:38.752 --> 04:28:45.619]  Cover the studio lights, the personnel, the TVs, the ridiculous amount of TVs we have around us right now.
[04:28:45.819 --> 04:28:47.661]  Unnecessary amount of televisions.
[04:28:48.041 --> 04:28:49.643]  It's because it's a building full of men.
[04:28:50.224 --> 04:28:53.627]  Nine, eighteen TVs just behind us right there.
[04:28:53.647 --> 04:28:54.208]  A giant television.
[04:28:54.548 --> 04:28:55.688]  So there it is.
[04:28:55.729 --> 04:28:57.589]  But that's all we've we've done it all with your help.
[04:28:58.029 --> 04:29:03.592]  And Alex Jones's ability to carry the ball every day and get on the radio and wake people up.
[04:29:04.272 --> 04:29:07.173]  And we thank you once again for your support.
[04:29:07.253 --> 04:29:08.914]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[04:29:09.354 --> 04:29:12.035]  Also check out head down HDFirearms.com.
[04:29:14.956 --> 04:29:18.779]  Head Down is one of our sponsors now, and we're encouraging people to go check out their firearms.
[04:29:18.839 --> 04:29:28.724]  I've fired both models that you've seen in the videos, and there's the Prevectus model, and really amazing rifles.
[04:29:28.765 --> 04:29:30.486]  They're very solidly built.
[04:29:31.326 --> 04:29:38.871]  I've got an old AK Draco pistol, and I fire a couple clips through that, and it's ready to fall apart and needs to be retightened.
[04:29:39.711 --> 04:29:43.012]  Fixed and you know, it's not, I think it's a Romanian AK.
[04:29:43.052 --> 04:29:45.972]  It's not, uh, it's not very, not very good.
[04:29:46.872 --> 04:29:49.653]  It's not very durable, but these Perfectus rifles are amazing.
[04:29:49.773 --> 04:29:50.833]  I've fired them myself.
[04:29:50.893 --> 04:29:51.713]  Very accurate.
[04:29:52.394 --> 04:29:56.714]  And especially once you get them dialed in and just, uh, you know, fun to shoot.
[04:29:57.155 --> 04:29:58.095]  So you got to fire one too.
[04:29:58.195 --> 04:29:58.395]  Yeah.
[04:29:58.555 --> 04:29:59.035]  I enjoyed it.
[04:29:59.215 --> 04:30:00.415]  I like the little grip.
[04:30:00.935 --> 04:30:01.075]  Yeah.
[04:30:01.095 --> 04:30:02.596]  A little soft grip there.
[04:30:02.636 --> 04:30:03.056]  It was good.
[04:30:03.076 --> 04:30:08.697]  It wasn't too big, you know, on my, uh, my hands and my weak little girly arms.
[04:30:08.917 --> 04:30:09.177]  All right.
[04:30:10.842 --> 04:30:12.783]  All right, with that, we're going to sign off.

[04:31:31.094 --> 04:31:32.315]  Another major health threat.
[04:31:32.355 --> 04:31:37.237]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[04:31:37.317 --> 04:31:39.978]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
