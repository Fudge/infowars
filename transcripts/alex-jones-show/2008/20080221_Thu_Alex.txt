[00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:06.595]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:08.297]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:10.118]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:11.600]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:13.262]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:17.746]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:22.171]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:29.752]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:51.487]  Thank you for joining us in another transmission against tyranny as we attempt to unlock the minds and awaken the people of the United States and the planet to the dark architects, the social engineers, the criminal technocrats that control the scientific dictatorship, the Pentagon design control grid that is rapidly expanding across the free world.
[00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:18.048]  As we are assailed with chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals on a daily basis, as the television dumbs us down, as the culture degenerates and rapidly falls apart, as the prisons sprout up like mushrooms after a spring rain, as the families unravel and disintegrate, we are here attempting to wake the population of the planet up.
[00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:19.529]  Former U.S.
[00:01:19.589 --> 00:01:28.633]  Ambassador and, of course, best-selling author, university professor, Peter Dale Scott will be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:39.097]  Then Daniel Estillon joins us in the middle of the second hour with new info on the New World Order and their latest operations after Davos and, of course, Bilderberg.
[00:01:40.338 --> 00:01:41.338]  It is the 21st day of February 2008.
[00:01:41.378 --> 00:01:42.078]  Indonesia accuses U.S.
[00:01:42.098 --> 00:01:42.839]  in Byrd
[00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:51.037]  Flu plot.
[00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.079]  This is out of the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.186]  Paul Watson has done a more detailed report that's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:01.047]  We'll be going over that.
[00:02:01.707 --> 00:02:03.629]  Why do we have Peter Dale Scott coming on?
[00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.492]  He is quoted in an excellent article
[00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:20.418]  In the San Francisco Chronicle that is taken directly from this radio show, directly from articles Paul Watson and I and others have written, where we chronologically have laid out how they're openly easing us into martial law.
[00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:26.460]  Now, I would imagine that these guys probably don't even know who I am that did this paper.
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.302]  But if you just look at it, you will come to the exact same results.
[00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:36.103]  None of it is even secret.
[00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:40.107]  The government publicly says they're preparing to put you in camps.
[00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:42.808]  They publicly say they're preparing to take your children.
[00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:45.690]  They publicly say they're preparing to forcibly inject you.
[00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.852]  They publicly say they can execute you if they want to, even if you're a U.S.
[00:02:49.872 --> 00:02:50.273]  citizen.
[00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:51.693]  No judge, no jury, no trial.
[00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:54.335]  They have been setting this up for decades.
[00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:55.476]  It's bipartisan.
[00:02:56.316 --> 00:03:00.358]  And the San Francisco Chronicle has come right out and admitted it.
[00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.080]  Right out with a huge story.
[00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:08.916]  Called Rule by Fear or Rule by Law.
[00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:13.620]  So we're going to be breaking this down in the first hour today.
[00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:19.506]  And guess what the FEMA camp program, quote, The Roundup of American Citizens is called?
[00:03:20.427 --> 00:03:21.188]  Endgame.
[00:03:21.488 --> 00:03:22.649]  Operation Endgame.
[00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.013]  And of course we talk about that in the film, Endgame.
[00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:27.834]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:29.516]  This is their endgame.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.421]  They intend to do it.
[00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:33.723]  This is the entire Pentagon goal.
[00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:36.005]  This is everything NORTHCOM does.
[00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:38.827]  They work for the private banks that own them.
[00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:45.373]  Everything they do is about deceit and lies and sterilization and poisoning and evil.
[00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:48.396]  But it's compartmentalized.
[00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:53.160]  Even captains and colonels and generals are compartmentalized and not see the full picture.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.561]  But at NORTHCOM,
[00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.700]  They're in Colorado Springs and in other areas.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.320]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.582]  They are wicked, America-hating traitors of the highest caliber.
[00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:09.582]  They are enemies of the Republic.
[00:04:09.862 --> 00:04:18.985]  They have systematically sought to legitimize torture, secret arrest, tasering, sound wave, microwave guns to be used on us.
[00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:19.945]  They've called for it.
[00:04:20.205 --> 00:04:23.466]  The military has been infiltrating police for 20 years.
[00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:24.766]  There's a huge black-op.
[00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:29.782]  Going on nationwide, worldwide, to take over our cities and counties.
[00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:31.503]  They ship in the narcotics.
[00:04:32.183 --> 00:04:33.844]  They do it all.
[00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.408]  It's all Pentagon programs to put AIDS virus in the hepatitis shots.
[00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.710]  It's all run by these boys.
[00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.573]  Our military has been taken over by the technocrats.
[00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:54.610]  It is a... People make fun of the military and say, oh, military intelligence, an oxymoron.
[00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.932]  They are total precision!
[00:04:57.192 --> 00:04:57.912]  They're not idiots!
[00:04:58.092 --> 00:04:59.273]  They got big brains!
[00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:09.744]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:05:10.205 --> 00:05:13.386]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:06:01.788 --> 00:06:03.168]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.309]  A new world order.
[00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.332]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.313]  It's known as the Bilderberg government.
[00:06:13.732 --> 00:06:15.953]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:18.955]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:27.040]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:35.049]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.971]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:41.852]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[00:06:41.932 --> 00:06:43.073]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:43.113 --> 00:06:43.833]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.853 --> 00:06:44.934]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:45.894]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.135 --> 00:06:47.155]  That's what they're after.

[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.361]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:00.022]  You have been warned.
[00:07:01.403 --> 00:07:02.584]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:07:02.684 --> 00:07:04.986]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:07:05.106 --> 00:07:08.088]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals, U.S.
[00:07:08.148 --> 00:07:08.848]  is a real thing.
[00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:15.793]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial, antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:21.177]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:22.097]  We're good to go!
[00:07:48.163 --> 00:07:51.884]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:56.946]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:59.907]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:06.548]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:09.229]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.931]  Government loves that image that they cultivate.
[00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:21.142]  Of the welfare line, the social security line, ineptness.
[00:08:23.162 --> 00:08:30.863]  But that's like flypaper or spider paper you put out to catch the little insects in.
[00:08:32.084 --> 00:08:45.446]  That's to slow us down as we spend all our time in red tape and bureaucracy and doing our taxes and they can selectively enforce and there's no tax form that they can't find criminality in to selectively send you to prison whenever they want.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.382]  Forbes Magazine, Money Magazine, one hired 20 CPAs, another hired 50.
[00:08:50.682 --> 00:08:58.825]  They got 50 and 20 different answers from each different CPA with the same tax documents, with the same receipts.
[00:09:00.786 --> 00:09:07.568]  But at the top, it's run by men and women that develop cruise missiles that can shoot through a window 30 years ago.
[00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:11.750]  Missiles that can be fired from the deck of a ship and blow a
[00:09:13.513 --> 00:09:26.984]  Satellite to pieces, or fire a particle beam through special mirrors in space that bounce it to within a few inches of its target, thousands of miles away, incinerating it.
[00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:30.047]  These are the individuals that designed the Internet.
[00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:32.489]  These are the individuals that designed it all.
[00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:35.351]  The flicker rate of the television was Pentagon designed.
[00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:36.532]  Everything
[00:09:37.663 --> 00:09:46.646]  Every major university serves them, compartmentalize, gives them the pieces they need, never even knowing what they're working on, to be assembled by even bigger brains.
[00:09:51.407 --> 00:10:05.272]  I mean, literally, every one of the greatest minds, mathematicians, idiot savants, top PR experts, the top psychologists, top psychiatrists, they all work for them, they've got them all.
[00:10:08.215 --> 00:10:14.107]  90 plus percent of science research in the universities is now DARPA controlled.
[00:10:16.952 --> 00:10:19.618]  And it's all how to sterilize you.
[00:10:20.356 --> 00:10:21.857]  It's all how to poison you.
[00:10:21.897 --> 00:10:24.698]  It's all how to do it incrementally so you don't notice.
[00:10:25.378 --> 00:10:47.349]  And then to, through the American Medical Association, compartmentalize it so they don't even know what's happening, so that they misidentify symptoms at the ground level, where the doctors are little more than technicians that follow their handbooks and have no earthly conception of what's happening.
[00:10:49.853 --> 00:10:57.761]  This is the elite on just incredible power trips playing God with genetic engineering, weapons development, you name it.
[00:11:02.826 --> 00:11:08.512]  And so I got up this morning, actually I found it last night, but I got up this morning and did some more research on the subject.
[00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:16.380]  You know, I'm kind of like the crazy uncle you keep in the basement of the attic in talk radio and in the quote patriot movement.
[00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:21.682]  Oh, I'm that weirdo that 12 years ago read FEMA documents on air about the concentration camps.
[00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:27.684]  I'm that weirdo that went to urban warfare drills and videotaped the troops training to take our guns here in the US.
[00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:30.425]  People couldn't deal with it then.
[00:11:32.106 --> 00:11:33.766]  But now it's all public.
[00:11:35.307 --> 00:11:38.888]  And so we are seeing more and more reports, more and more discussions about it.
[00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:51.577]  But the spin we're getting from Bob Woodward, and the spin we're getting from Naomi Wolf, and the spin we're getting from the San Francisco Chronicle is that it's Bush.
[00:11:52.978 --> 00:12:08.910]  Bush is a mentally unstable person who they chose because they could control him and then dump everything they did in their last eight years of their agenda on him, and then they move it over to a Hillary or a Barack Obama,
[00:12:11.288 --> 00:12:12.248]  And then they move on.
[00:12:12.808 --> 00:12:17.089]  And then by the time you figure out that they're corrupt, doesn't matter, they give you a new Patsy.
[00:12:17.589 --> 00:12:18.510]  A new Schill.
[00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:40.975]  So that you never notice that they're just puppets and that it's the technocrats, the technocracy, that is pulling the strings and orchestrating this like a... orchestra... orchestrator... conductor...
[00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.111]  And we see this happening.
[00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:47.172]  Here's the San Francisco Chronicle today.
[00:12:47.252 --> 00:12:49.674]  I'm just going to read this and then I'll comment as I go.
[00:12:51.054 --> 00:12:53.296]  Rule by fear or rule by law.
[00:12:53.456 --> 00:12:54.756]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.777]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:12:57.358 --> 00:13:07.243]  The power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers
[00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:19.916]  "...is in the highest degrees odious, and is the foundation of all totalitarian governments, whether Nazi or Communist, Winston Churchill, November 21st, 1943."
[00:13:20.736 --> 00:13:24.778]  The attack of habeas corpus is the root, I would add.
[00:13:25.579 --> 00:13:35.964]  "...since 9-11, and seemingly without the notice of most Americans, the federal government has assumed the authority to institute martial law
[00:13:38.308 --> 00:13:50.652]  Arrest a wide swath of dissidents, citizens and non-citizens alike, and detain people without legal or constitutional recourse in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the United States.
[00:13:51.192 --> 00:13:52.512]  They do that because they think that's popular.
[00:13:52.912 --> 00:13:59.974]  Or to support the rapid development of new programs.
[00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:05.056]  Beginning in 1999, the government has entered into a series of single-bit
[00:14:06.954 --> 00:14:16.056]  ...and single-bid, no-bid contracts with Halliburton, subsidiary Kellogg, Brown & Root, KBR to build detention camps in undisclosed locations within the United States.
[00:14:17.576 --> 00:14:27.038]  The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars, some reportedly equipped with shackles, ostensibly to transport detainees.
[00:14:27.498 --> 00:14:30.579]  This is the San Francisco Chronicle saying this.
[00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:38.912]  According to diplomat and author Peter Dale Scott, KBR contract is part of a homeland security plan titled End Game.
[00:14:38.932 --> 00:14:40.613]  Well, that's public.
[00:14:40.953 --> 00:14:42.293]  We covered that four years ago.
[00:14:42.873 --> 00:14:47.574]  Which sets as its goal the removal of all removable aliens and potential terrorists.
[00:14:49.975 --> 00:14:56.536]  Fraud busters such as Representative Henry Waxman of Los Angeles have complained about these contracts, saying that more taxpayer dollars should not go to
[00:14:58.368 --> 00:15:12.938]  Taxpayer gouging Halliburton, but the real question is, what kind of new programs require the Constitution and the construction and refurbishment of detention facilities in nearly every state of the Union with the capacity to hold perhaps millions of people?
[00:15:13.058 --> 00:15:16.001]  Well, this one contract says three million.
[00:15:16.361 --> 00:15:17.642]  Three one million man camps.
[00:15:18.582 --> 00:15:22.005]  And again, we've been... You read this article, it sounds bad.
[00:15:22.025 --> 00:15:23.386]  It's not one one-hundredth of it.
[00:15:23.406 --> 00:15:24.386]  And it didn't start in 99, by the way.
[00:15:29.825 --> 00:15:37.514]  1042 the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act use of armed forces in major public emergencies gives the executive
[00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:42.777]  The power to invoke martial law, it actually says it, for the first time in more than a century.
[00:15:43.138 --> 00:15:56.130]  The President is now authorized to use the military in response to a natural disaster, a disease outbreak, a terrorist attack, or any other condition in which the President determines that domestic violence has occurred to the extent that state officials cannot maintain public order.
[00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.933]  And it goes on to talk about insurrection, rebellion in there.
[00:16:00.248 --> 00:16:01.529]  See, it's worse than what this says.
[00:16:01.969 --> 00:16:17.019]  The Military Commissions Act of 2006, ran through Congress just before the 2006 midterm elections, allows for the indefinite imprisonment of anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on a list of terrorist organizations, even retroactively, or who speaks out against the government's policies.
[00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:20.962]  The law calls for secret trials of citizens and non-citizens alike.
[00:16:21.902 --> 00:16:26.986]  Also in 2007, the White House quietly issued National Security Presidential Directive 51 NSPD
[00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:31.487]  Now, it's much worse than that again.
[00:16:59.562 --> 00:17:08.930]  The entire Homeland Security Committee has asked to see the full text of this secret document, and Congress was told, Bush is now above Congress, you're not allowed to see it.
[00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:19.178]  See our article, written over a year ago, titled, Martial Law Plan Is So Bad Not Even Congress Can See It.
[00:17:20.026 --> 00:17:21.067]  Now, by the way, that's criminal.
[00:17:21.087 --> 00:17:28.730]  The President just can't tell Congress and the Homeland Security Committee, who are even, quote, certified with the highest security clearances, oh, sorry, you can't see this plan.
[00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.951]  Well, we reverse-engineered it, and we know what it is.
[00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:34.073]  They have to train the troops, and we've gone out and shown you how they're being trained.
[00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:36.434]  They're being trained to line you up and blow your heads off.
[00:17:37.194 --> 00:17:39.776]  They're being trained to forcibly inject you and take your guns, okay?
[00:17:40.056 --> 00:17:44.778]  And now they admit they've hired 26,000 preachers to run around the streets telling you to submit when they do this.
[00:17:45.818 --> 00:17:46.939]  See, it's much worse than what they say.
[00:17:48.553 --> 00:17:49.414]  Continues, U.S.
[00:17:49.454 --> 00:17:54.658]  Representative Jane Harman has come up with a new way to expand the domestic war on terror.
[00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:58.341]  Her Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act, H.R.
[00:17:59.402 --> 00:18:14.075]  1955, which passed the House by a lopsided vote of 404 to 6, which set up a commission to examine and report on the facts and causes of so-called violent radicalism and extremism ideology, then make legislative recommendations on combating restricting free speech.
[00:18:14.704 --> 00:18:27.849]  According to commentary in the Baltimore Center, Representative Harmon and her colleagues from both sides of the aisle believe the country faces a native brand of terrorism, and that's what turned up in saying the new threat, everything shifting over, quote, to blonde-haired blue-eyed Al-Qaeda.
[00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:29.970]  Totally imaginary, but i.e.
[00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.771]  the general public.
[00:18:31.991 --> 00:18:34.772]  And needs a commission with sweeping investigative power to combat it.
[00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:39.194]  A clue as to where Harmon's commission might be aiming
[00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:49.148]  Is the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act a law that labels those who engage in sit-ins, civil disobedience, trespass, or any other crime in the name of animal rights as terrorists?
[00:18:50.328 --> 00:19:00.010]  Other groups in the crosshairs could be anti-abortion protesters, anti-tax agitators, immigration activists, environmentalists, peace demonstrators, Second Amendment rights supporters, the list goes on and on.
[00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:05.531]  According to author Naomi Wolf, the National Counterterrorism Center holds the names of roughly 775,000 terrorist suspects.
[00:19:09.272 --> 00:19:14.495]  And their own training manuals say gun owners, land rights activists, you, me.
[00:19:17.397 --> 00:19:25.682]  And the number of people on the terror list increases by 20,000 per month and under the new system you won't be able to buy or sell because you're going to have to swipe your card again.
[00:19:26.642 --> 00:19:30.705]  What could the government be contemplating that leads it to make contingency plans for detaining without
[00:19:32.111 --> 00:19:34.113]  Resources, millions of its own citizens.
[00:19:34.613 --> 00:19:38.396]  The Constitution does not allow the executive to have unchecked power under any circumstances.
[00:19:38.416 --> 00:19:46.722]  The power must not allow the president, the people must not allow the president to use the war on terrorism to rule by fear instead of by law.
[00:19:48.744 --> 00:19:49.885]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:52.687 --> 00:19:54.008]  Starting to figure out what's happening?
[00:19:55.509 --> 00:19:56.770]  All I've told you is the truth.
[00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:58.191]  That's all I've told you.
[00:19:58.772 --> 00:19:59.052]  Okay?
[00:20:02.887 --> 00:20:04.948]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.588 --> 00:20:14.492]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.972 --> 00:20:22.135]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:28.344]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.844 --> 00:20:39.674]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.434 --> 00:20:42.496]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.997 --> 00:20:44.418]  For more information, call 702-953-7000.
[00:20:51.054 --> 00:20:56.438]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:56.959 --> 00:20:58.460]  A new world order.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:09.049]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of governments.
[00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:13.953]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:13.973 --> 00:21:16.214]  Both their objectives be world domination.
[00:21:16.755 --> 00:21:19.157]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:27.245]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.268 --> 00:21:35.251]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.712 --> 00:21:39.194]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.594 --> 00:21:42.076]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:42.136 --> 00:21:43.277]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.317 --> 00:21:44.077]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.097 --> 00:21:45.158]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.378 --> 00:21:46.099]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:47.380]  That's what they're after.

[00:21:59.047 --> 00:22:00.048]  You have been warned.
[00:22:00.168 --> 00:22:01.269]  We're good to go.
[00:22:21.218 --> 00:22:21.598]  We're good.

[00:23:03.326 --> 00:23:04.607]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[00:23:04.867 --> 00:23:06.867]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:23:07.028 --> 00:23:08.748]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:10.169]  The Late Great USA.
[00:23:10.409 --> 00:23:11.829]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[00:23:56.775 --> 00:24:05.340]  All right, we're back live.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.782]  Professor Peter Dale Scott is joining us to talk about Operation Endgame.
[00:24:09.903 --> 00:24:11.463]  They are radically expanding it.
[00:24:11.584 --> 00:24:14.305]  Everything they're doing is about clamping martial law down.
[00:24:14.785 --> 00:24:16.807]  They'll probably do it under Hillary or Obama.
[00:24:17.227 --> 00:24:19.968]  The Democrats will suddenly love it, worship it.
[00:24:20.829 --> 00:24:22.350]  They're suddenly not going to dislike it.
[00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.271]  They're coming for us.
[00:24:25.538 --> 00:24:27.440]  They've overthrown hundreds of third world countries.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.360]  They want to do it here.
[00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:30.862]  But they're taking their time bringing down the U.S.
[00:24:31.463 --> 00:24:34.165]  What do you do when your own military goes bad?
[00:24:34.185 --> 00:24:35.786]  What do you do when your own government goes bad?
[00:24:37.248 --> 00:24:38.168]  That is coming up.
[00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:41.311]  San Francisco Chronicle writing an article that sounds like I wrote it.
[00:24:42.192 --> 00:24:44.093]  You see people are tuning into the reality now.
[00:24:44.473 --> 00:24:47.596]  They're finding out we're becoming passe here.
[00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:54.212]  Gold has hit its all-time high of $953 and climbing.
[00:24:54.232 --> 00:24:55.552]  $953 an ounce.
[00:24:55.872 --> 00:25:01.575]  Ted Anderson has gold in stock at the price it was last week at $920.
[00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:07.098]  Ladies and gentlemen, he has got it at $30 below.
[00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:16.623]  So, again, with the price he set it at, this is set at the price that it was a week ago at $920.
[00:25:18.266 --> 00:25:19.887]  And he is going to run out of these coins.
[00:25:20.047 --> 00:25:37.211]  Ted, how many of the British Sovereigns, how many of the Franks out of Europe, out of France and Belgium and other places, those quarter-ouncers, wonderful coins, how many of those do you have right now at the original price, as gold hits its all-time high?
[00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:41.073]  Well, I secured a deal on the British Sovereigns, about 250 coins.
[00:25:41.413 --> 00:25:44.193]  The Franks, I think I had less than that, maybe about 100, 150.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.243]  The silver, I mean, those silver coins at $19 per face, well, silver right now is over $18 now.
[00:25:50.283 --> 00:25:50.363]  It's $18.05.
[00:25:57.926 --> 00:26:00.627]  So that's now less than a buck over the spot.
[00:26:00.827 --> 00:26:01.727]  Yeah, excuse us.
[00:26:01.767 --> 00:26:08.388]  Ted has to make one dollar an ounce on that, literally just to pay the people to take the phone calls and ship it out to you.
[00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:10.189]  He's doing this to introduce you to it.
[00:26:10.469 --> 00:26:11.989]  You cannot find better deals.
[00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:13.129]  Ted, tell them about the offering.
[00:26:13.309 --> 00:26:16.330]  Well, right now, currently, we have the British Sovereign coin.
[00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.890]  It's at $2.54.
[00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.390]  You can do the math.
[00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.771]  It's a quarter ounce gold piece.
[00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:23.711]  We have the Frank coin, which is a one-fifth ounce gold coin.
[00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:24.812]  Also, a very good buy, $2.02.
[00:26:27.192 --> 00:26:30.994]  And then the silver right now is at $19 per face.
[00:26:31.034 --> 00:26:35.556]  I know it's kind of confusing, but 4 quarters and 10 dimes equal the same amount of silver.
[00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:43.339]  So if you do the math, $1 per face at $19, I'd suggest that people pick it up at $100 face quantities.
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.481]  Right now, the handwriting is on the wall.
[00:26:48.521 --> 00:26:50.201]  We talked about this yesterday, Alex.
[00:26:50.622 --> 00:26:52.582]  The gold and silver game is not over.
[00:26:53.503 --> 00:26:56.264]  The gold should be up in the $2,000 range.
[00:26:56.384 --> 00:26:57.744]  Silver should be up closer to $50.
[00:26:58.604 --> 00:27:01.726]  Could be closer to $100 if you do the inflation thing against $50 in 1980.
[00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:02.746]  Silver could easily be $100 an ounce.
[00:27:08.588 --> 00:27:10.830]  And this thing's climbing, the dollar's falling.
[00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.051]  We all know what's going on.
[00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:16.915]  Look at the news that you're giving us about our government and our own military.
[00:27:17.015 --> 00:27:17.875]  I mean, my God!
[00:27:18.376 --> 00:27:19.497]  We do have to prepare.
[00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:25.821]  We have to have things that are going to be valuable that's outside of the realm of what the government can control.
[00:27:25.881 --> 00:27:29.244]  And this is a commodity that people have to dig it out of the ground.
[00:27:29.304 --> 00:27:30.085]  It takes labor.
[00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:32.126]  It's been money for over 6,000 years.
[00:27:32.186 --> 00:27:34.428]  The United States hasn't even been around that long.
[00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:37.411]  It outlasted the rise and the fall of the Roman Empire.
[00:27:37.811 --> 00:27:42.495]  It's going to outlast the rise and the fall of the United States Empire as well.
[00:27:45.778 --> 00:27:49.562]  Right now, I talk to people, they say, what should I do with my IRA?
[00:27:49.622 --> 00:27:51.544]  What should I do with my money in the stock market?
[00:27:51.584 --> 00:27:54.927]  What should I do with all this real estate that I have?
[00:27:54.987 --> 00:27:57.669]  The whole house of cards is falling apart right now, Alex.
[00:27:57.689 --> 00:27:58.210]  This is it!
[00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:00.407]  The handwriting is on the wall.
[00:28:00.427 --> 00:28:01.167]  It's going to be bad.
[00:28:01.207 --> 00:28:02.368]  The question is how bad.
[00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:05.750]  That's what all the economic experts, the top names we bring you here say.
[00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:07.071]  I believe in this.
[00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:08.291]  This is a great deal.
[00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:10.452]  Ted, tell them about the gold coins you're offering.
[00:28:10.632 --> 00:28:12.433]  Well, right now it's the British Sovereign.
[00:28:12.473 --> 00:28:14.395]  They're at $254 per coin.
[00:28:14.495 --> 00:28:16.696]  And I also have the French Franc at $202.
[00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:21.158]  I have some of the old $5 gold pieces that are still around at $340.
[00:28:21.779 --> 00:28:24.300]  Alex, you can't find a better time to be buying this stuff.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:29.206]  I mean, well, you can turn back the clock six years, and you could almost triple your money.
[00:28:29.306 --> 00:28:37.295]  Well, all of those are great deal, but the silver and the French francs, those are just absolute barn burners.
[00:28:37.596 --> 00:28:38.257]  Here's the number, 1-800-686-7000.
[00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:41.879]  Yeah, you're going to have to pay more.
[00:28:41.939 --> 00:28:44.000]  Just say you heard it on Alex and we'll give you the discount.
[00:29:08.524 --> 00:29:15.425]  Well, I'll certainly make the commitment that I'll hold it all throughout today, and if the prices hold, I'll do it tomorrow as well.
[00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:17.272]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:29:17.292 --> 00:29:19.273]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:25.057]  This is a no-brainer, Ted.
[00:29:25.097 --> 00:29:30.862]  People should have moved earlier, but if they think gold's hit its high, all the smart money's on it just going crazy.
[00:29:31.422 --> 00:29:32.763]  Yeah, that's for sure, Alex.
[00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:34.324]  It's going to go higher.
[00:29:34.364 --> 00:29:35.325]  There's no question about it.
[00:29:35.545 --> 00:29:37.927]  And again, it's not that gold's really going up in price.
[00:29:37.987 --> 00:29:39.868]  It's that America is going in the toilet.
[00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:43.131]  The martial law mavens have set it all up.
[00:29:44.655 --> 00:29:47.477]  This is just a stopgap emergency measure 800-686-2237.
[00:29:49.098 --> 00:29:50.719]  We'll be back with Operation Endgame.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.000]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.481 --> 00:29:55.082]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:30:06.562 --> 00:30:11.464]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:11.664 --> 00:30:12.985]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[00:33:01.718 --> 00:33:06.342]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:33:06.382 --> 00:33:10.685]  What if I say I'm not just another one in your place?
[00:33:10.765 --> 00:33:11.906]  Gonna pretend to?
[00:33:11.946 --> 00:33:14.869]  What if I say I'll never do better?
[00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:17.090]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.033]  What if I say I'm not just another one in your place?
[00:33:20.093 --> 00:33:21.114]  Gonna pretend to?
[00:33:21.154 --> 00:33:22.995]  What if I say I'll never do better?
[00:33:27.735 --> 00:33:38.883]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:40.004 --> 00:33:44.908]  Professor, author, diplomat, Peter Dale Scott is our guest.
[00:33:46.429 --> 00:33:52.814]  And he is quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle article, Rule by Fear or Rule by Law?
[00:33:54.114 --> 00:33:55.675]  And you would think that he had written this article.
[00:33:55.695 --> 00:33:56.876]  You would think that I had written it.
[00:33:57.817 --> 00:33:59.458]  We're all separate investigators.
[00:33:59.498 --> 00:34:00.719]  We're separate from each other.
[00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:04.061]  I discovered all this back in the mid-1990s.
[00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:05.502]  I went to urban warfare drills.
[00:34:05.622 --> 00:34:09.265]  I witnessed troops training to take our guns, training to put us in camps.
[00:34:09.745 --> 00:34:14.669]  I made Police State 2000, Police State 2 the takeover, Police State 3 total enslavement.
[00:34:15.269 --> 00:34:22.933]  People saw the Marines in Maryland and California training to break up our families, and they thought I'd hired aircraft carriers, the Coronado.
[00:34:23.334 --> 00:34:25.655]  They thought I'd hired helicopters, thousands of troops.
[00:34:26.175 --> 00:34:38.682]  My director friend, Rick Linklater, who saw Police Day 2000, I told him about how people thought it was fake Marines, and he laughed and said, you know, that would cost $50 million for me, even if I could get the military to, you know, help me make something fictitious.
[00:34:39.742 --> 00:34:43.584]  I had documents in the film, but people couldn't believe it in the late 1990s.
[00:34:45.484 --> 00:34:49.667]  There is secret black-op operations going on everywhere since the late 80s.
[00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:53.931]  They've had military secretly working with police in gun and drug raids.
[00:34:54.311 --> 00:34:55.852]  This is now all coming public.
[00:34:55.872 --> 00:34:57.574]  This is a long strategic plan.
[00:34:58.575 --> 00:35:02.418]  The greatest threat to a free society has always been its military.
[00:35:03.098 --> 00:35:11.265]  Or, even if it's a dictatorial society like Rome and its decline, where one month to the next you'd have a new emperor who is normally the last head of the Praetorian Guard.
[00:35:13.135 --> 00:35:14.736]  And they have built the FEMA camps.
[00:35:14.796 --> 00:35:15.957]  It didn't start under Bush.
[00:35:16.097 --> 00:35:17.577]  It has radically accelerated.
[00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:21.199]  And he has, in PDD 51, declared that he is a dictator.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:29.624]  The Supreme Court this week said he is above the law, agreed with the Alberto Gonzales doctrine that the Führer precept.
[00:35:30.624 --> 00:35:37.588]  Everyone who looks at this, whether it's Dr. Paul Craig Roberts or Peter Dale Scott or Naomi Wolf or even
[00:35:38.965 --> 00:35:41.909]  You know, one of the guys that brought out the whole Nixon situation.
[00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:46.494]  Bob Woodward has written about this, giving speeches a year ago saying he's worried about martial law.
[00:35:46.755 --> 00:35:50.399]  Willie Nelson came on the last two weeks twice and said he's worried.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.542]  Anybody who's paying attention...
[00:35:53.465 --> 00:35:53.926]  No, it's not.
[00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:19.971]  Well, I'm glad to join you, and I'm glad you brought up the question of martial law, because I think that's the biggest issue here.
[00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:24.995]  The building of these detention camps is a matter of concern, but martial law is the big picture.
[00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:52.436]  And you're right, this goes way back behind the current Bush administration.
[00:36:52.996 --> 00:37:10.722]  In fact, you know, one of the little-noticed things about James McCord, who was one of the Watergate burglars, was that he was working then for the Office of Emergency Management, and he was working on plans to build detention camps to detain American civilians.
[00:37:11.528 --> 00:37:16.331]  And so, yes, these plans are at least 30 years old.
[00:37:16.391 --> 00:37:18.773]  They get bigger and bigger as time goes on.
[00:37:18.793 --> 00:37:36.364]  And the movements, just in the last six years since 9-11, and this, by the way, all has to do with 9-11, the steps that have been taken since then to move towards martial law are very striking.
[00:37:36.772 --> 00:37:39.153]  They're so public that people don't notice them.
[00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:51.578]  But we used to have, of course, the Posse Comitatus Act, which said that the military would not be used in a normal way in law enforcement in this country.
[00:37:51.678 --> 00:37:56.359]  And that act has been effectively superseded.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.561]  And they wanted to use the military.
[00:37:59.581 --> 00:38:02.502]  I think, actually, to some extent, they did use the military.
[00:38:02.662 --> 00:38:03.162]  Katrina
[00:38:03.635 --> 00:38:08.380]  They brought in the military again when we had forest fires here in California last year.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.482]  And that was a laboratory test in Katrina.
[00:38:10.502 --> 00:38:12.864]  They wouldn't bring food, they would just come confiscate the guns.
[00:38:13.564 --> 00:38:15.867]  And not only that, they sent in Blackwater.
[00:38:15.987 --> 00:38:22.653]  They sent in private security people who had the power to shoot and kill down in New Orleans.
[00:38:23.594 --> 00:38:27.798]  And there are plans to make that sort of thing permanent as well.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:34.506]  I want to break down how it developed 30 plus years ago in an embryonic phase.
[00:38:34.726 --> 00:38:43.977]  I've even seen photos and documents and news articles about drills to take over towns for domestic control under Eisenhower, and it's just expanded since then.
[00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:47.522]  But you said the key point there, and I was making that before you came on.
[00:38:48.149 --> 00:38:50.692]  This no longer is just in declassified documents.
[00:38:50.712 --> 00:38:51.673]  This is now public.
[00:38:52.113 --> 00:39:04.125]  And most chilling of all, we know about the billions spent for fake reporters and agents of influence and fake newscasts, but something that was overlooked was 400 plus thousand dollars paid to Tommy Franks
[00:39:04.625 --> 00:39:14.011]  Three years ago, when he, quote, retired, to go around on Fox and CNN and to give interviews saying, gee, I'm sad it's going to happen, but it's the only thing that will keep us safe.
[00:39:14.571 --> 00:39:17.353]  One more attack and we're going to go to military rule and martial law.
[00:39:17.713 --> 00:39:21.975]  And then it came out that he was being paid by the White House to go carry that message.
[00:39:22.356 --> 00:39:29.840]  It's the fact that they're trying to introduce the idea and desensitize us means they may be considering doing it.
[00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:40.542]  Well, it's true, you have people who are put in this area to plan this sort of thing, and the longer they plan, the bigger their ideas get.
[00:39:40.823 --> 00:39:58.276]  But if I could break it down historically, what happened in the Eisenhower era was at the height of the Cold War, people, I knew some of these people in government, they were very genuinely frightened of a nuclear attack, and there had to be planning, what are you going to do with a nuclear attack?
[00:39:58.736 --> 00:39:59.377]  That doesn't
[00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:01.261]  Shock me so much.
[00:40:01.722 --> 00:40:06.383]  The second stage, this would involve James McCord at the time of Watergate.
[00:40:06.943 --> 00:40:13.505]  They were very frightened of insurrection in the American cities because to some extent we were getting it then.
[00:40:13.565 --> 00:40:17.987]  We did have, you know, riots that lasted for days and people were killed.
[00:40:18.047 --> 00:40:20.348]  There were millions of dollars of property damage.
[00:40:20.788 --> 00:40:26.390]  What is the third stage that alarms me the most is what's happened since about, I think it's 1981.
[00:40:28.668 --> 00:40:35.051]  FEMA, by the way, Federal Emergency Management Agency, has been the infrastructure for all this planning.
[00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:51.637]  It was only created in 1979, replacing earlier organizations, and certainly from the beginning of the Reagan era, it's been involved in planning for emergency situations
[00:40:52.287 --> 00:40:54.788]  When really, it's not clear what was the emergency.
[00:40:54.848 --> 00:40:57.288]  We were no longer frightened of nuclear attack.
[00:40:57.348 --> 00:41:00.789]  And by the way, that's no longer even the aim of this planning.
[00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:02.850]  They've taken that out of the planning.
[00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:08.131]  They're no longer frightened of massive insurgencies the way they had.
[00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:11.312]  I think they are very worried about dissent.
[00:41:11.672 --> 00:41:20.975]  And particularly now with the rise of the Internet, they are actually, they've had a war game in order to figure out how to control the Internet.
[00:41:21.707 --> 00:41:26.932]  And so, it's the gratuitous nature of this planning.
[00:41:27.032 --> 00:41:31.016]  They have, what, a list of people who could be rounded up?
[00:41:31.036 --> 00:41:32.658]  775,000 people?
[00:41:32.778 --> 00:41:33.579]  Something like that.
[00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:35.400]  That's you and me, Alex.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.822]  We're on that list, I'm sure.
[00:41:37.865 --> 00:41:38.546]  Oh, guaranteed.
[00:41:38.586 --> 00:41:40.628]  In fact, we've gotten FBI training documents.
[00:41:40.648 --> 00:41:41.269]  We've got it all.
[00:41:41.369 --> 00:41:48.738]  It's gun owners, pro-life demonstrators, animal rights people, land rights, environmentalists.
[00:41:48.778 --> 00:41:50.200]  I mean, it's basically everybody.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:56.848]  And we see the Pentagon in Houston and New York and other places using regular army to go infiltrate peace groups.
[00:41:57.388 --> 00:41:58.528]  This is going on everywhere.
[00:41:58.628 --> 00:42:04.130]  Then we find that they're actually provocateuring groups, have police hired to provocateur, start fights.
[00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:09.192]  They're also trying to radicalize to have the excuse to use all of this.
[00:42:09.992 --> 00:42:11.153]  And so that's the key here.
[00:42:11.193 --> 00:42:15.334]  We've seen this grow, but I would have to say it's thousands of times what it was
[00:42:16.174 --> 00:42:23.918]  30 years ago, and now most of the new big scholarships from the federal government are for homeland security, spying, data mining.
[00:42:24.638 --> 00:42:41.265]  I now see them, Professor Scott, shifting the infrastructure of the military-industrial complex into a stance that is mainly looking into controlling the United States, and they openly call us a containment or war zone under NORTHCOM.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:47.122]  Yes, they created a military district in 2002 called NORTHCOM.
[00:42:47.522 --> 00:42:53.003]  That was the key step in overriding the Posse Coma Tattoo Act.
[00:42:54.304 --> 00:43:05.387]  America is now treated as a zone for military activity the way that SOUTHCOM treats Latin America and CENTCOM treats Asia.
[00:43:06.007 --> 00:43:10.929]  By the way, some of the people who have been planning this, too,
[00:43:11.647 --> 00:43:15.228]  It's planning that goes back to the 1980s.
[00:43:15.608 --> 00:43:26.610]  I think it's worth pointing out that when President Reagan, with an executive order, he set up people to plan this, he brought in people from outside the government.
[00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.510]  And one of them was Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:32.791]  And another of the planners in the 1980s was Dick Cheney.
[00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:34.771]  He was a congressman from Wyoming.
[00:43:34.811 --> 00:43:37.872]  He had no other responsibilities at that time.
[00:43:38.405 --> 00:43:50.417]  And those two men have been on the planning continuously since the 1980s, including under Clinton, when at that point neither of them were in the government, each of them was the CEO of a big corporation.
[00:43:50.878 --> 00:44:01.208]  So there has been, and then what they were finally able to implement, this was called Continuity of Government Planning, and this Continuity of Government Planning, COG we call it,
[00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:12.708]  It envisaged martial law, it envisaged massive warrantless detentions, it envisaged warrantless surveillance, all the things that we now have.
[00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:21.134]  And COG, I hope everyone listening to this knows this, COG was actually implemented on September the 11th, 2001.
[00:44:23.306 --> 00:44:27.328]  And nobody yet has been able to find out what exactly that meant.
[00:44:27.528 --> 00:44:28.449]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:44:28.569 --> 00:44:38.154]  Congress last year tried to see PDD 51, not just the White House release, the front page, but the actual planning, you know, the full... And the annexes.
[00:44:38.194 --> 00:44:40.835]  There were classified annexes that it admitted.
[00:44:41.235 --> 00:45:01.961]  And exactly, first one member wanted to see it, then the chairman wanted to see it, and Bush said to Congress, even though they have the highest security clearances, you can't see it, but on its face it says Bush is above the government, then we have, so really, they're trying to legitimize, and just in plain view, Professor, phase in open martial law.
[00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:03.042]  Is that an accurate statement?
[00:45:03.342 --> 00:45:05.602]  Yes, and I want to take it a bit further.
[00:45:07.853 --> 00:45:15.799]  Well, the PDD 51, it explicitly was about continuity of government planning.
[00:45:16.239 --> 00:45:37.215]  Well, the books that have been written about continuity of government planning, there are two good ones, one by James Mann, The Rise of the Vulcans, and another one by James Bamford, Pretext for War, and both of them quote how these planners, they were planning the role of Congress in an emergency,
[00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:40.320]  And they decided that Congress wasn't important.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:56.226]  So you have documents here which are providing, in effect, for suspension of the Constitution, for the suspension of the activities of Congress, and when Congress wants to see what those documents are, they're told they can't see them.
[00:45:56.466 --> 00:45:57.246]  Now let me stop you.
[00:45:57.306 --> 00:45:58.246]  Let me stop you right there.
[00:45:58.306 --> 00:46:01.668]  I hope listeners, police officers, everybody, you're listening to magnitude.
[00:46:01.728 --> 00:46:02.528]  The President
[00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:32.493]  Has these war planners, these private corporate people that came in, we have the National Security Act 1947, the shadow government begins, then by the eighties, these top corporate legates, or super gophers, step in, through the power of that shadow government, they only amass more power, now they're old, now they want to see all this happen, and to be clear, this is now in slow motion, in kind of a slow motion Red Dawn,
[00:46:33.494 --> 00:46:43.382]  You know, to use that term of an invasion, are flicking the switches on, activating it, then having their PR mechanisms explain it all away.
[00:46:43.402 --> 00:46:52.289]  I mean, this is the magnitude of Congress being told, you don't run anything because some private planners say we do.
[00:46:52.670 --> 00:47:00.056]  Then you have the no-bid contracts, the torture, the corruption, the slave trafficking that Halliburton's been caught BBC doing.
[00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:02.517]  I mean, this is like something out of a nightmare.
[00:47:03.698 --> 00:47:05.939]  I mean, Professor Scott, it's one thing if they planned it.
[00:47:06.179 --> 00:47:07.280]  They're now implementing.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:08.680]  What is the time frame?
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.522]  I mean, you think they're going to go ahead and go for it all?
[00:47:11.922 --> 00:47:14.803]  Or I do see a massive resistance starting to form.
[00:47:16.184 --> 00:47:20.746]  My own feeling, first of all, I'm not as panicked as some people are.
[00:47:21.327 --> 00:47:23.808]  I think they want to possess these powers.
[00:47:24.326 --> 00:47:30.891]  I don't know that they are tremendously interested in exercising them in a spectacular way.
[00:47:31.011 --> 00:47:32.212]  I think quite the contrary.
[00:47:32.712 --> 00:47:40.999]  I think they would like to maintain a kind of appearance of continuity and slip these things in one after another.
[00:47:41.519 --> 00:47:50.326]  But I think that the root issue at the bottom of it is they also have plans for hegemonic domination of the world.
[00:47:50.836 --> 00:47:54.620]  Permanent troops in Iraq, and this goes to both parties.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.986]  And that's why they have to secure us as the Hessian slaves, the Hessian war slaves.
[00:48:01.988 --> 00:48:05.973]  They know that democracy and empire are not really compatible.
[00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:07.715]  One of them has to prevail.
[00:48:08.237 --> 00:48:10.719]  If democracy prevails, we'll have less empire.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:15.344]  Well, that's what Pinak says, and also Zbigniew Brzezinski's Grand Chess Board.
[00:48:15.384 --> 00:48:21.870]  He says, we're democratic, the people don't like war, if we don't have giant catalyzing terror attacks, it's not going to happen.
[00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:22.851]  Boy, that's pretty obvious.
[00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:32.376]  Yes, but on the other hand, you know, I've seen, well, you know, I just had a book come out where I write about all this called The Road to 9-11.
[00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:34.277]  Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America.
[00:48:34.317 --> 00:48:35.398]  The Road to 9-11, yes.
[00:48:35.558 --> 00:48:41.282]  Yes, and some of the reviews of it say, well, I'm worried about a military coup.
[00:48:41.342 --> 00:48:42.803]  That's not what I'm worried about.
[00:48:42.843 --> 00:48:46.625]  A military coup would be like a public demonstration.
[00:48:46.645 --> 00:48:47.346]  Look, folks,
[00:48:47.901 --> 00:48:50.405]  The year of the American Constitution is over.
[00:48:50.465 --> 00:48:52.027]  We've replaced it with something else.
[00:48:52.267 --> 00:48:53.669]  That's not what they want to do.
[00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:59.197]  They want people to go on thinking that they still live under the Constitution at a time
[00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:03.123]  When they have managed to override the Constitution.
[00:49:03.143 --> 00:49:04.563]  No, no, that's it, that's exactly it.
[00:49:04.583 --> 00:49:19.090]  But I see that as even a greater danger, this creeping death, as they corporatize, privatize, transfer everything over, get rid of the Bill of Rights piecemeal, then they could clamp down overnight and people wouldn't even notice.
[00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:26.453]  Yes, well, this is why this current issue, I'm shocked that this all, what you brought up about how the
[00:49:26.946 --> 00:49:38.489]  Homeland Security Committee, the House Committee, was not able, they asked to see the documents, they demanded to see the documents, and they were told that they didn't have the authorization to see the documents.
[00:49:38.889 --> 00:49:50.512]  Now that is a contest between the powers conferred by the Constitution versus the powers that are being conferred by the secret planners, some of whom weren't even in the government.
[00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:54.973]  And the mainstream press ought to have made a huge issue of this.
[00:49:55.713 --> 00:49:58.255]  Congressman DeFazio spoke about it in the House.
[00:49:58.295 --> 00:49:59.836]  He tried to make an issue of it.
[00:50:00.356 --> 00:50:03.938]  It's very depressing to me that that happened more than six months ago.
[00:50:04.739 --> 00:50:12.584]  And so far, there's no demand in the media for a resolution of this contest.
[00:50:12.624 --> 00:50:14.585]  There's no real demand in Congress.
[00:50:14.605 --> 00:50:16.526]  Well, this is what happened with Julius Caesar.
[00:50:16.846 --> 00:50:19.428]  He just announced himself Caesar and the Senate went along.
[00:50:20.482 --> 00:50:24.243]  And, uh, you know, a lot of people don't know the Roman history.
[00:50:24.303 --> 00:50:30.586]  They think that Caesar and Augustus closed down the Senate and all the Roman institutions.
[00:50:30.626 --> 00:50:31.046]  They didn't.
[00:50:31.466 --> 00:50:33.167]  The institutions kept on going.
[00:50:33.187 --> 00:50:35.828]  They just now had emperors.
[00:50:35.848 --> 00:50:38.108]  The word emperator really means general.
[00:50:38.169 --> 00:50:44.851]  They had generals who were running things, and the Senate could go on talking till they were blue in the face, just like
[00:50:45.393 --> 00:50:51.219]  Our Senate, our Congress can worry about what kind of steroids Roger Simmons was taking.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.403]  But the big issues are being ignored by Congress.
[00:50:54.423 --> 00:50:55.444]  Peter Del Scott, stay there.
[00:50:55.504 --> 00:50:57.145]  The new book is The Road to 9-11.
[00:50:57.346 --> 00:50:58.807]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:50:58.827 --> 00:50:59.288]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.086 --> 00:51:14.841]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:15.262 --> 00:51:21.990]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:22.770]  We're good to go.
[00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:52.550]  We're good to go.
[00:52:02.203 --> 00:52:08.205]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home that you can use anytime that helps reduce back pain, sciatica, hip pain, and more?
[00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:11.166]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms.
[00:52:11.426 --> 00:52:13.707]  You need the Sacrowegi Sacral Stabilizer.
[00:52:13.987 --> 00:52:17.569]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle.
[00:52:17.729 --> 00:52:18.509]  Yes, that's right.
[00:52:18.569 --> 00:52:23.591]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[00:52:23.771 --> 00:52:27.472]  Gravity does the work with the Sacrowegi under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[00:52:27.652 --> 00:52:29.693]  Help correct posture to help relieve the pain.
[00:52:29.933 --> 00:52:31.754]  Better balance equals fewer problems.
[00:52:31.914 --> 00:52:34.955]  You can even sit on the Sacroegi at the computer or while traveling.
[00:52:35.115 --> 00:52:40.477]  This device has been helping people for the past 15 years, yet the cost is still just $29.95.
[00:52:40.697 --> 00:52:43.758]  Finally, something available that really relieves those stubborn aches and pains.
[00:52:43.898 --> 00:52:47.159]  Order your Sacroegi now and get a free instructional DVD.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:47.720]  Just call 1-800-737-9295.
[00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:47.940]  That's 1-800-737-9295.
[00:53:02.225 --> 00:53:09.208]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[00:53:09.428 --> 00:53:10.668]  We got immediate results.
[00:53:11.009 --> 00:53:15.730]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual when he's disrespectful, defiant, or even abusive?
[00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.831]  Do you know how to fix it?
[00:53:17.231 --> 00:53:22.593]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior right now with the Total Transformation.
[00:53:22.913 --> 00:53:25.976]  The program then helps you fix every behavior problem under the sun.
[00:53:26.337 --> 00:53:31.342]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[00:53:31.562 --> 00:53:34.325]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:39.570]  The Total Transformation is the program I've used for over 30 years to solve even the worst behavior problems.
[00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:43.652]  Your child will listen to you again, and you'll get peace and sanity back into your home.
[00:53:43.972 --> 00:53:44.612]  I guarantee it.
[00:53:45.012 --> 00:53:49.254]  Call now and get how to turn your child's attitude around in one minute or less, free with your order!
[00:53:49.274 --> 00:53:49.714]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 Call now!
[00:53:49.734 --> 00:53:49.874]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402
[00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:09.591]  He's got a new book out.
[00:54:09.631 --> 00:54:10.872]  It's extremely powerful.
[00:54:11.392 --> 00:54:14.074]  The Road to 9-11, Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America.
[00:54:14.415 --> 00:54:16.996]  We're going to talk more about it for about 20 minutes into the next hour.
[00:54:18.618 --> 00:54:22.260]  Professor Peter Dale Scott, again, is our guest.
[00:54:24.402 --> 00:54:28.285]  And we'll put out some of his websites or contact points for you before he leaves us as well.
[00:54:28.305 --> 00:54:30.647]  We have links to those up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:54:32.328 --> 00:54:33.849]  Professor, you know, I have a family.
[00:54:33.949 --> 00:54:34.590]  I have children.
[00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:49.899]  I see them militarizing the police, giving them the federal training, the tasers, the Pentagon-designed face-scanning cameras, this grid the Pentagon brags that they want to, quote, use the same control grid that they have in Afghanistan and Iraq here.
[00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:52.121]  I mean, it's public.
[00:54:52.161 --> 00:54:55.764]  They have Army war planners come out and say that we don't work for the American people.
[00:54:56.164 --> 00:55:00.687]  Naval war planners at the War College saying we work for Madison Avenue.
[00:55:02.762 --> 00:55:07.464]  They want to be able to threaten the rest of the establishment with this power they have, obviously.
[00:55:08.024 --> 00:55:14.106]  But if they do stage another event, or provocateur, or allow a big-ass terrorist attack to happen, they could go hot overnight.
[00:55:14.926 --> 00:55:16.666]  But either way, we're being eased into this.
[00:55:18.007 --> 00:55:20.608]  Any other observations or ways to fight this?
[00:55:20.628 --> 00:55:22.868]  I mean, I do think people are waking up.
[00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:26.570]  I just want it to stop.
[00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:29.631]  And on top of that, I see the Democrats getting into office.
[00:55:29.651 --> 00:55:30.711]  They're just going to continue with it.
[00:55:31.586 --> 00:55:41.714]  I'm afraid that we're not going to end these problems by electing anybody who's got a chance of winning in 2008 is not going to make a big difference.
[00:55:41.734 --> 00:55:42.255]  That's right.
[00:55:42.695 --> 00:55:44.376]  I would say, what can we do?
[00:55:44.456 --> 00:55:56.626]  Well, there's what we can do right now, and then right after that I want to discuss what we should do if there is another 9-11 type event, if there is a real risk that there may be.
[00:55:57.206 --> 00:55:58.167]  As for right now,
[00:55:58.835 --> 00:56:10.462]  I want to read what one of the COG planners said in the 1980s, about the 1980s, to James Mann.
[00:56:10.542 --> 00:56:17.786]  He said, one of the awkward questions we faced was whether to reconstitute Congress after a nuclear attack.
[00:56:18.307 --> 00:56:22.649]  It was decided that no, it would be easier to operate without them.
[00:56:22.869 --> 00:56:25.551]  Well of course it would be easier, that's the whole point of
[00:56:26.212 --> 00:56:32.115]  The Constitution is to make it a little bit difficult for people in power to operate by whim.
[00:56:32.595 --> 00:56:37.917]  Now, you might say, well, that's not relevant, because that was about what to do after a nuclear attack.
[00:56:38.317 --> 00:56:45.180]  But what happened in the 1980s was that they expanded the idea of continuity of government.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.541]  That's their code word for it.
[00:56:47.661 --> 00:56:51.223]  I think, really, COG, in fact, stands for change of government.
[00:56:51.263 --> 00:56:54.004]  I mean, if you suspend the Constitution, then you
[00:56:55.276 --> 00:56:57.097]  Push Congress off to one side.
[00:56:57.137 --> 00:57:04.518]  Now they're saying it's about the economy and that they're going to order the economy and of course give all the no-bid contracts to themselves.
[00:57:04.738 --> 00:57:07.699]  This is about a bunch of mobsters just sucking us dry.
[00:57:08.479 --> 00:57:19.142]  It's now explicitly by an executive order, COG planning is in response to any emergency and that's why we got it on September the 11th.
[00:57:19.222 --> 00:57:23.103]  That wasn't a nuclear attack but we got COG because they've changed
[00:57:23.723 --> 00:57:30.647]  The target of COG to be any emergency, and that includes natural disasters.
[00:57:31.368 --> 00:57:47.397]  Now, what we should do right now is clear up this matter, which is more important, the powers of Congress under the Constitution, the ability to review plans, which here we are told by one of the planners
[00:57:48.012 --> 00:57:51.594]  And include the suspension of Congress altogether.
[00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:53.316]  It's an open statement, isn't it?
[00:57:53.616 --> 00:57:55.097]  That do we have a Congress?
[00:57:55.157 --> 00:57:56.218]  Do we have a Republic?
[00:57:56.458 --> 00:57:59.100]  Or are we just a dictatorship of the elite?
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.362]  Well, come down to the people who are watching this show.
[00:58:02.922 --> 00:58:09.627]  I think they should all be putting pressure on their congressmen, their senators, to say, resolve this issue.
[00:58:10.067 --> 00:58:13.189]  Does Congress have the right to see these COG plans?
[00:58:13.269 --> 00:58:16.091]  I think that is the most important constitutional issue.
[00:58:16.516 --> 00:58:17.256]  Stay there, Professor.
[00:58:17.296 --> 00:58:17.957]  We've got a break.
[00:58:18.077 --> 00:58:24.120]  We'll be back in 70 seconds to talk about what if they stage another big event, and we all know it's staged.
[00:58:24.421 --> 00:58:25.141]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.536 --> 00:58:45.698]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:49.441 --> 00:58:50.582]  I did.
[00:58:50.642 --> 00:58:58.909]  Here comes my song.
[00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:03.293]  Don't let go.
[00:59:12.809 --> 00:59:19.074]  The establishment has been doing...
[00:59:36.286 --> 00:59:49.471]  Is to set the precedent to secretly arrest you, secretly execute you, take your property, not let you fly, not let you drive, not let you have a job under the new Homeland Security Real ID Act.
[00:59:53.153 --> 01:00:01.957]  And they even said back during the 80s, they could grab a bunch of illegal aliens to kind of shell conservatives on in the mix while they grab the political dissidents.
[01:00:02.477 --> 01:00:03.417]  They have stated it.
[01:00:04.578 --> 01:00:05.258]  Both parties
[01:00:06.491 --> 01:00:07.451]  They've trained the troops.
[01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.434]  They can go hot anytime, or they can just continue the incremental slide.
[01:00:12.454 --> 01:00:13.614]  I wouldn't even call it incremental now.
[01:00:13.674 --> 01:00:15.215]  It's at breakneck speed.
[01:00:15.235 --> 01:00:18.877]  The new book is The Road to 9-11, Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America.
[01:00:19.517 --> 01:00:20.518]  Professor Peter Dale Scott.
[01:00:20.538 --> 01:00:28.221]  Professor, please continue with if there is a new staged event or a new provocation, a new 9-11, what flows out of that?
[01:00:28.742 --> 01:00:31.643]  Well, I want to be very clear that if there is
[01:00:32.347 --> 01:00:38.070]  Another event of, you know, it could be smaller, it could be bigger, it could easily be bigger.
[01:00:39.551 --> 01:00:54.300]  Like 9-11, the first principle that every American citizen should insist on is we do not invade any countries until we have had a thorough examination of exactly what happened in this event.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.621]  You know, here it is now, 2008, we still haven't had a proper
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:16.073]  Investigation of what happened on September the 11th, 2001, is a new book by Philip Sheenan about the activities of the 9-11 Commission, and it's clear that they were just rushing to judgment the same way that the Warren Commission was rushing to judgment back in 1964.
[01:01:16.334 --> 01:01:18.515]  They were White House appointed.
[01:01:19.336 --> 01:01:25.841]  They were White House appointed, and the director who wrote, directed the writing of the report
[01:01:26.579 --> 01:01:39.509]  was not only very close to Condoleezza Rice and had written a book with her, he had also written the National Security Strategy, which called for a preemptive war.
[01:01:39.649 --> 01:01:43.592]  So he was not a disinterested bystander, outsider.
[01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:48.475]  He was a principal in the whole system that needed to be investigated.
[01:01:49.076 --> 01:01:50.577]  A architect, a fellow traveler.
[01:01:51.109 --> 01:02:05.893]  Yeah, and well anyway, so what I want to say is that if we have another of these events, we need to be sure that it is properly investigated before we go to a major war.
[01:02:06.273 --> 01:02:17.236]  Look at even, you know, I rarely agree with the Council on Foreign Relations, but their journal, Foreign Affairs, had an article in, I think it was April 2007, saying we may very well
[01:02:20.365 --> 01:02:33.370]  have a 9-11 attack type attack, and it might look as if it was Iran, but we shouldn't immediately go into Iran.
[01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:45.916]  And it pointed out, I'm worried of other people doing it, but the article was worried that Al-Qaeda would do it, because Al-Qaeda is Sunni, it hates the Shia government of Iran,
[01:02:47.768 --> 01:02:51.289]  It wants more power for the Sunnis and Afghans.
[01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:54.230]  Yeah, that's a line being put out by Robert Bayer right now, too.
[01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:55.750]  Uh-huh.
[01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:59.891]  But the point is, the overall point is a good one.
[01:03:00.351 --> 01:03:06.313]  If you have an event like this, you don't go to war until you've analyzed the event.
[01:03:06.373 --> 01:03:14.755]  That is, you know, when history is written 200 years from now, they will say that one of the signs that the American government may be the best
[01:03:15.396 --> 01:03:38.022]  constitutional system in the world, I would be prepared to argue that it is, but it broke down completely in 2001 when we committed to two wars against two countries on the flimsiest of evidence, and we still, even now, we have second thoughts about the wars, but we haven't got to the point of having second thoughts about the evidence.
[01:03:38.762 --> 01:03:43.483]  He's the author of The Road to 9-11, Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America, Peter Dale Scott.
[01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:47.080]  Big segment coming up with him on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.342]  InfoWars.com's been redesigned.
[01:03:49.462 --> 01:03:49.982]  Check it out.
[01:03:53.925 --> 01:03:55.606]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:03:55.926 --> 01:03:59.388]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:03:59.548 --> 01:04:01.470]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.752]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:04:05.072 --> 01:04:09.275]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the
[01:04:09.315 --> 01:04:09.655]  We're good.
[01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:39.756]  We're good to go.

[01:05:54.227 --> 01:05:54.888]  It's a fact.
[01:05:55.088 --> 01:06:02.578]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:06:02.698 --> 01:06:09.087]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all loans.
[01:06:09.087 --> 01:06:09.607]  I think so.
[01:06:28.912 --> 01:06:33.933]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:06:34.113 --> 01:06:38.594]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[01:07:37.023 --> 01:07:38.584]  Peter Del Scott is our guest.
[01:07:40.205 --> 01:07:49.951]  We'll be talking to him in just one moment, but for now, the immortal Waylon Jennings.
[01:08:06.355 --> 01:08:11.578]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[01:08:12.358 --> 01:08:18.862]  Rage her blades and dice in her mind.
[01:08:18.882 --> 01:08:22.564]  Just a touch of sadness in her veins.
[01:08:23.765 --> 01:08:26.266]  Thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[01:08:34.066 --> 01:08:36.787]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:39.147 --> 01:08:47.829]  The good news is, five years ago in major polls, less than 10% of the country believed that the electronic no-record die-bolt machines and others were a fraud.
[01:08:48.209 --> 01:08:51.890]  Now 85% in Gallup poll believe it, and know it, and they're in trouble.
[01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:53.010]  People are going to prison.
[01:08:53.610 --> 01:08:54.611]  We're ferreting them out.
[01:08:55.311 --> 01:09:00.892]  Most Americans would laugh 15 years ago when people talked about the new world order and martial law and the gear up for it.
[01:09:01.639 --> 01:09:02.579]  Now people don't laugh.
[01:09:02.699 --> 01:09:03.960]  Now it's coffee table talk.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.241]  And on every front, people don't want the war.
[01:09:07.301 --> 01:09:08.141]  They don't want any of this.
[01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:11.262]  So the establishment is just making it a little bit more obvious.
[01:09:11.402 --> 01:09:16.184]  Oh, the illusion of freedom and liberty is okay, but not the real thing.
[01:09:17.664 --> 01:09:30.488]  Peter Dale Scott, we're going to talk about your new book, The Road to 9-11, before you leave us, but we have to think about what will happen if the establishment stages a nuke, or lets a group in to do something, or blows up some more buildings, or
[01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:32.491]  We're good to go.
[01:09:56.861 --> 01:10:04.124]  I guess it's just after the FEMA camp and after a few years of torture, Peter Dell Scott will say he's a terrorist, kind of like these six people they've had for six years.
[01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:14.327]  I mean, with that one guy, he's admitted to bombing buildings that didn't exist when he was arrested, or killing people that weren't killed, you know, until three years after he was arrested.
[01:10:15.288 --> 01:10:16.428]  It's just, they don't care.
[01:10:16.768 --> 01:10:20.049]  I mean, we do look at that happening, don't we?
[01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:21.490]  I mean, that is in the cards.
[01:10:22.216 --> 01:10:26.678]  Yes, well, I mean, it's very hard to know what's in the cards.
[01:10:28.119 --> 01:10:34.022]  I know that the government, you know, personally, I'm totally non-violent.
[01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:37.304]  The worst thing I ever did was march against something.
[01:10:37.444 --> 01:10:43.227]  I've never even been arrested in a protest, which is, here in Berkeley, it's almost something to be embarrassed about.
[01:10:43.747 --> 01:10:44.408]  They don't care!
[01:10:44.428 --> 01:10:44.948]  They don't care!
[01:10:46.839 --> 01:10:53.062]  I asked my FBI file in 1978, and I just asked for the headquarters file.
[01:10:53.102 --> 01:10:54.623]  I should have asked for San Francisco.
[01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:57.725]  The headquarters file was 985 pages.
[01:10:58.205 --> 01:11:12.994]  Well, if they have that much on somebody who's totally non-violent, or my friend Brian Wilson, who fasted, he marched, he was committed to non-violence, and when they got his files, it turned out they were treating him as a terrorist.
[01:11:13.689 --> 01:11:17.952]  So, to come back to what you were saying... They're the terrorists.
[01:11:19.713 --> 01:11:20.053]  Sorry?
[01:11:20.534 --> 01:11:22.115]  They're the terrorists.
[01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:25.237]  That's terrorism having files on peace activists.
[01:11:25.757 --> 01:11:26.057]  Right.
[01:11:26.238 --> 01:11:37.025]  Well, to come back to what you were saying a bit earlier, we know so much more about these things now, and the main reason we know about it is because of the Internet.
[01:11:37.475 --> 01:11:47.680]  That the mainstream media, which there's a good book out just out about how they've all been tied up with the CIA and have been able to manipulate public opinion.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.281]  Well that came out in 77 with Mockingbird, but go ahead.
[01:11:50.742 --> 01:11:59.106]  Yes, but there's a new one, a new book by a man called Wilford that is a very good extended treatment of it.
[01:11:59.886 --> 01:12:05.929]  The alternative to that is the alternative media and above, well your show would be an example,
[01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:08.227]  But the internet is the main thing.
[01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:14.632]  One thing to watch for, I say in my book, that the internet is like the canary in the cave.
[01:12:14.752 --> 01:12:17.955]  If the canary stays alive, then democracy is still alive.
[01:12:19.437 --> 01:12:24.861]  Freedom of information on the Internet, there is certainly hope for this country.
[01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:30.824]  But they're coming with Internet 2, saying they'll decide what tier you can be on, what data can flow.
[01:12:31.065 --> 01:12:32.746]  They're already clamping down on sites.
[01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:36.348]  We do see them at least putting their toe in the water with censorship.
[01:12:36.828 --> 01:12:46.114]  Well, there was a judicial decision just this week to dismantle a website because they didn't like something they did.
[01:12:46.635 --> 01:12:48.035]  WikiLeaks, yeah.
[01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:49.930]  Yes, that's right.
[01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:57.635]  Well, I want to say in a general way that everyone should be watching for the maintenance of freedom of access to the Internet.
[01:12:57.975 --> 01:13:04.419]  They should know, I quote this in my book, that the government had a war game under NORTHCOM.
[01:13:04.459 --> 01:13:08.301]  They had a war game called Fibrestorm, which was all about the Internet.
[01:13:08.321 --> 01:13:11.703]  And I'm going to quote here from an AP story about it.
[01:13:12.979 --> 01:13:25.326]  The cyberstorm was an exercise to test how the government would respond to devastating attacks from anti-globalization activists, underground hackers, and bloggers!
[01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:27.427]  And bloggers!
[01:13:28.007 --> 01:13:38.293]  So they said that they were going to deal with activist calls by internet bloggers whose weblogs include political rantings and musing about
[01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.689]  Musings about current events.
[01:13:41.029 --> 01:13:41.729]  How dare they?
[01:13:41.749 --> 01:13:43.990]  Well, you and I are musing about current events.
[01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.691]  And they are planning to do something about it.
[01:13:47.952 --> 01:13:52.453]  Well, I mean, this would have convicted the Nazis right there for going against free speech.
[01:13:52.653 --> 01:13:55.034]  And I mean, right there, they show who they are.
[01:13:55.054 --> 01:13:58.235]  And they've had hearings in Congress where they list 9-11 truth groups.
[01:13:58.616 --> 01:14:03.477]  I mean, they're saying we're lumped in with terrorists because we talk about political issues.
[01:14:03.517 --> 01:14:04.638]  They're saying that's evil.
[01:14:05.171 --> 01:14:26.487]  Right, and there's another cyberstorm war game coming up in March of this year, so I think people should watch about that, and need to know what it's doing, and get Congress to do something, because what is the instrument of democracy, the institution of democracy, that is supposed to push back against an aggressive administration?
[01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:33.933]  It's supposed to be the Congress, so the people have to push on Congress, so that Congress will push against what the administration is doing.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:37.283]  Well, I agree with you and we've got to defend this republic.
[01:14:37.404 --> 01:14:41.248]  Did you see Gary Hart last year in September 26?
[01:14:41.328 --> 01:14:43.391]  It was all over the web and in some newspapers.
[01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:52.362]  Unsolicited advice to the government of Iran where he makes a not even veiled threat and says, well let me just read the quote here.
[01:14:53.658 --> 01:14:57.740]  For historians of American wars, the question is whether we provoke provocations.
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:06.623]  And he goes on to, just to paraphrase it, he says, hey, we staged the deal in Havana with the USS Maine, the Gulf of Tonkin, 1964.
[01:15:07.283 --> 01:15:11.885]  He says, don't think that just because the people are against war that we won't have a provocation.
[01:15:12.386 --> 01:15:13.246]  Did you see that letter?
[01:15:13.786 --> 01:15:15.667]  I did not, no, but it's a good point.
[01:15:15.947 --> 01:15:20.909]  We should be very, very mindful of the Tonkin Gulf incidents because we had some Gulf
[01:15:21.454 --> 01:15:30.099]  Persian Gulf incidents last year, which were hyped up as being an unsolicited attack on a U.S.
[01:15:30.179 --> 01:15:32.320]  destroyer by a small PT boat.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.222]  Well, that was the scenario for Tonkin Gulf.
[01:15:35.542 --> 01:15:38.944]  And then it turned out that it was fake radio transmissions and was a setup.
[01:15:38.964 --> 01:15:40.125]  Both of them were fake, yeah.
[01:15:40.185 --> 01:15:42.766]  Tonkin Gulf was fake, and this other one was fake.
[01:15:42.786 --> 01:15:49.470]  It was a story that was hyped up in the Pentagon by the same people that gave us the false information
[01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:53.530]  About Saddam and weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[01:15:53.770 --> 01:16:02.759]  But that's the good news is a lot of their propaganda is falling flat on its face now because they're using a 30 year old propaganda model against us.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:08.405]  I hope that the American people are becoming smarter about this sort of thing.
[01:16:08.445 --> 01:16:13.310]  We have been exposed to so much false propaganda in the last six years.
[01:16:13.772 --> 01:16:18.055]  That we should have an unusually savvy electorate for a while.
[01:16:18.116 --> 01:16:21.158]  You know, a generation from now, people may begin to forget.
[01:16:21.638 --> 01:16:39.593]  But right now, people should be very aware that they are being lied to, that they have been brought into a disastrous war in Iraq, for which there was no... You know, even the people being responsible for going after Osama Bin Laden,
[01:16:41.618 --> 01:16:51.786]  I agree that this was a terrible setback in the war on terrorism because we've produced a whole new generation of would-be terrorists by what we've been doing in Iraq.
[01:16:52.026 --> 01:16:54.869]  But that justifies the system.
[01:16:55.689 --> 01:17:04.937]  So it becomes a cycle that expands itself until somebody tries to stop it from outside.
[01:17:05.057 --> 01:17:06.057]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:09.532]  They admit that they want the strategy of tension.
[01:17:09.972 --> 01:17:13.195]  They plan to generate actual, real resistance.
[01:17:13.235 --> 01:17:16.117]  They need that to continue their militarized cycle.
[01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:20.421]  They very much want to keep bases in Iraq.
[01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:30.809]  I'm disappointed that both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, when they say they want to bring back troops, ask them, do they want to bring back all the troops?
[01:17:30.929 --> 01:17:32.510]  Because the answer is, no, they don't.
[01:17:33.131 --> 01:17:34.652]  They want to keep the permanent bases.
[01:17:35.154 --> 01:17:37.956]  We've built permanent bases there, and they want to keep them.
[01:17:38.497 --> 01:17:46.783]  So I think the key here is to tell Democrats, don't think this all ends if Bush leaves office, which we hope he does, because this agenda is going to continue.
[01:17:46.823 --> 01:17:47.824]  We have to continue fighting.
[01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:52.307]  We have to fight the agenda and not pin it on personalities.
[01:17:52.427 --> 01:17:55.489]  It's much bigger than just personalities, as you said at the beginning.
[01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:58.051]  You know, I want to keep you for one more segment at the bottom of the hour.
[01:17:58.071 --> 01:17:59.813]  We're about to break here for a short break.
[01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:00.333]  Can you do that?
[01:18:00.353 --> 01:18:02.875]  Because I want to specifically spend five minutes on your book.
[01:18:03.519 --> 01:18:03.999]  Very good.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.121]  Okay, we're going to break here in just a moment.
[01:18:06.541 --> 01:18:09.743]  Fire out any websites that you think people should check out, Professor.
[01:18:10.323 --> 01:18:16.447]  Well, I'd like to mention my own, which is easy to remember, www.peterdalescott.org.
[01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:19.409]  Peterdalescott.org?
[01:18:19.429 --> 01:18:21.310]  Yes.
[01:18:21.851 --> 01:18:26.854]  Not peterdalescott.com, because that's somebody else's website trying to shoot me down.
[01:18:27.954 --> 01:18:28.215]  Really?
[01:18:28.255 --> 01:18:28.915]  That's nasty.
[01:18:29.535 --> 01:18:30.416]  Peterdalescott.org.
[01:18:32.856 --> 01:18:40.438]  I want to talk about your book, and your book gets into the shadowy controllers, the deep government, as you call it, that nexuses in with the multinational corporations.
[01:18:40.498 --> 01:18:45.319]  What their overall agenda is, not just their rook, that is the neocons.
[01:18:45.359 --> 01:18:46.620]  They're just high-level servants.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:50.461]  We'll get Peter Del Scott's take on that in a final segment.
[01:18:50.521 --> 01:18:52.841]  Then, Daniel Esselstyn joining us from Spain.
[01:18:54.342 --> 01:18:55.742]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:56.822 --> 01:18:59.503]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:03.378]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:03.458 --> 01:19:05.239]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:19:05.519 --> 01:19:08.521]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[01:19:09.101 --> 01:19:11.523]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.283 --> 01:19:19.728]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:27.573]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:28.073 --> 01:19:31.516]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.937 --> 01:19:34.439]  Bill Burgess is making great progress in the New World Order.
[01:19:34.479 --> 01:19:35.660]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.441]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.461 --> 01:19:37.522]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.722 --> 01:19:38.543]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.683 --> 01:19:39.744]  That's what they're after.

[01:19:55.638 --> 01:20:00.822]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:20:00.982 --> 01:20:02.343]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:20:02.603 --> 01:20:10.769]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:23:05.666 --> 01:23:09.447]  This is unlike any tyranny we've ever seen.
[01:23:09.547 --> 01:23:10.427]  It's scientific.
[01:23:10.467 --> 01:23:11.107]  It's focused.
[01:23:14.648 --> 01:23:15.688]  It's forward-looking.
[01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:18.269]  It's very calculating.
[01:23:19.349 --> 01:23:20.310]  Building each block.
[01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:34.513]  And then also, the corporations and individuals that run this in both parties, they also make hundreds of millions of dollars apiece owning stock or being on the board of directors of the new police state industries.
[01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:36.164]  It's simple.
[01:23:36.184 --> 01:23:42.909]  The bomb makers that own our media, that themselves are owned by the central banks, just decided, hey, let's go ahead and just take it all over.
[01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:50.414]  And you see defense contractors owning the red light cameras, owning the face scanning cameras, owning and controlling stock in private prison companies.
[01:23:51.175 --> 01:24:00.182]  Peter Dell Scott, this is a self-replicating tyranny, very hard to beat, because it uses our tax money to fund itself through the private sector.
[01:24:01.317 --> 01:24:11.402]  Well, I think this is a good country to take on this sort of thing, because we do have strong traditions of the people doing things.
[01:24:11.582 --> 01:24:20.266]  I think we saw in Watergate, for example, a check to unrestricted executive power.
[01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:24.928]  We need, in effect, another Watergate crisis in this country.
[01:24:26.343 --> 01:24:31.285]  And I don't write off this country as a dictatorship by any means.
[01:24:31.445 --> 01:24:39.989]  And as I said, I think one of the big resources that we both have, and we will have power as long as we have this resource, is the Internet.
[01:24:40.869 --> 01:24:48.612]  But we're dealing with what is in one sense a very old problem in this country, which is, and it's not spoken about nearly enough,
[01:24:49.144 --> 01:24:58.431]  Which is that the 1% of this country owns such a huge percentage of it, maybe 60, 70, 80% of personal stock.
[01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:12.741]  Franklin Roosevelt said, I lead off my book with a quote from Jefferson, a quote from Theodore Roosevelt, which I'm going to read his here, we hold it a prime duty of the people to free our government
[01:25:13.206 --> 01:25:14.727]  From the control of money.
[01:25:14.847 --> 01:25:17.849]  He said that in 1912, almost a century ago.
[01:25:17.929 --> 01:25:19.250]  Well, we haven't done it yet.
[01:25:19.831 --> 01:25:37.383]  And then Franklin Roosevelt said in 1933, and it was in a private letter, where he was speaking to a friend, the real truth is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:43.251]  Well, that's why I call my subtitle, Wealth, Empire, and the Future of America.
[01:25:43.491 --> 01:25:44.871]  There is the problem.
[01:25:45.031 --> 01:25:46.792]  It's never really been addressed.
[01:25:47.352 --> 01:26:04.638]  It has got worse recently because of, as Eisenhower warned, the military-industrial complex, which was quite centralized and powerful, and which has in a sense hijacked the real economy, and through that has hijacked
[01:26:05.656 --> 01:26:06.657]  The power of it.
[01:26:06.717 --> 01:26:18.703]  Why do you think Eisenhower, because he was their boy, I know they brought Northwoods to him and he said no, then Kennedy said no, but he looked even paranoid in that farewell address and something gets dropped and he looks like he's worried.
[01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:24.246]  Why do you think Eisenhower warned about the undue influence of the military-industrial complex?
[01:26:24.986 --> 01:26:31.790]  I think that it bore in upon him increasingly, especially in his second term.
[01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:34.131]  He began to realize that
[01:26:34.747 --> 01:26:37.288]  He was not in control of his administration.
[01:26:37.348 --> 01:26:52.514]  I think he was... We've got to go to some past history here, but the U-2 incident, which sabotaged the summit meeting, which he wanted to have with the Russians, made him realize that there were some powers that he wasn't dealing with.
[01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:57.796]  And so he made this warning, and it's interesting, you know, he did it totally on his own.
[01:27:00.867 --> 01:27:05.168]  Only a very small handful of people around him knew he was going to make that speech.
[01:27:06.068 --> 01:27:12.671]  And so I think if he said, well, you know, I'm leaving now, I can just... He cared about the country.
[01:27:13.091 --> 01:27:13.931]  There's no shortage.
[01:27:13.971 --> 01:27:18.773]  Well, if you look at his eyes, he is looking around him like he's paranoid while he's saying it.
[01:27:19.353 --> 01:27:21.694]  Well, he always had that way of looking around him.
[01:27:22.354 --> 01:27:25.255]  I go back to that era, and I remember his press conferences.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.982]  Maybe he was paranoid at that moment, but he had the guts to say it.
[01:27:30.523 --> 01:27:34.145]  And he had one or two people around him, like Goodpastor, who supported him.
[01:27:34.466 --> 01:27:40.570]  But the thing is that in those days, the military-industrial complex was a segment of the economy.
[01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:48.136]  What has happened, really, since Nixon, is that increasingly it has become the economy.
[01:27:48.676 --> 01:27:53.980]  And then when people say, well, we have other things that do very well, like aircraft and electronics,
[01:27:55.471 --> 01:27:56.391]  Subsidiaries.
[01:27:57.251 --> 01:28:01.572]  All of these are adjunct to the military budget.
[01:28:02.272 --> 01:28:13.855]  And we don't have, you know, they talk free enterprise and so on, but the core of the American economy now is oil and arms, which are very tied up.
[01:28:13.935 --> 01:28:14.575]  And drugs.
[01:28:14.815 --> 01:28:16.235]  You write about that in the book.
[01:28:16.255 --> 01:28:17.135]  Oh yes, that too.
[01:28:17.196 --> 01:28:19.796]  But I'm talking about the official economy.
[01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:24.377]  Then there's the black economy, which is, I believe, a significant part.
[01:28:25.332 --> 01:28:30.695]  I mentioned that in this book, but I'm really saving most of that for the next book I'm going to write.
[01:28:30.815 --> 01:28:31.436]  Absolutely.
[01:28:31.476 --> 01:28:32.256]  The Road to 9-11.
[01:28:32.696 --> 01:28:34.457]  PeterDaleScott.org.
[01:28:34.818 --> 01:28:35.538]  Be sure and get it.
[01:28:35.798 --> 01:28:38.820]  Professor, I'm going to have you back up for even longer next time.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:39.500]  Thank you.
[01:28:40.141 --> 01:28:41.321]  I've enjoyed this very much.
[01:28:41.782 --> 01:28:42.382]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:44.423 --> 01:28:45.364]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.804 --> 01:28:47.385]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:51.047]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:56.010]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:59.271]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:04.132]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:29:04.492 --> 01:29:07.113]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:29:07.373 --> 01:29:12.254]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:29:12.454 --> 01:29:14.234]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:29:14.434 --> 01:29:20.156]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:29:20.416 --> 01:29:22.116]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:29:22.436 --> 01:29:26.419]  Yes, SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:29:26.859 --> 01:29:37.865]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.

[01:29:53.675 --> 01:29:56.617]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:29:56.777 --> 01:30:01.981]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:30:02.301 --> 01:30:07.585]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:08.005 --> 01:30:09.146]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:09.507 --> 01:30:18.373]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.

[01:30:53.368 --> 01:30:58.313]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:30:58.633 --> 01:31:00.515]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:31:00.695 --> 01:31:03.758]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:31:03.938 --> 01:31:07.061]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:31:07.381 --> 01:31:09.223]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:31:09.483 --> 01:31:13.184]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:31:13.484 --> 01:31:16.124]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:31:16.144 --> 01:31:21.026]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:31:21.246 --> 01:31:25.546]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:30.267]  The Bible says, Would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[01:31:30.588 --> 01:31:32.608]  These materials document the global leaders,
[01:31:32.688 --> 01:31:32.928]  We're good.
[01:31:57.282 --> 01:31:59.804]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:32:00.284 --> 01:32:13.414]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:14.135 --> 01:32:17.917]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:18.918 --> 01:32:24.162]  We've been talking about the end game, the plan to take your children from you, put you in camps, line you up and shoot you.
[01:32:26.064 --> 01:32:26.504]  Now they don't
[01:32:27.666 --> 01:32:31.028]  Have to go with that plan because they're just incrementally taking everything over to begin with.
[01:32:31.549 --> 01:32:35.551]  I mean, we're in martial law when they get up on the news and say it's the law, you gotta take vaccines when there is no law.
[01:32:36.232 --> 01:32:40.635]  You're under martial law when they're setting up random checkpoints on the highway or on buses and trains.
[01:32:41.775 --> 01:32:42.856]  But the border's wide open.
[01:32:43.757 --> 01:32:50.281]  We're in martial law when they selectively enforce DWI and insurance laws on citizens, but illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:32:51.334 --> 01:32:52.955]  They do what they want, when they want.
[01:32:52.995 --> 01:32:55.897]  It is a hopelessly corrupt and degenerate society.
[01:32:56.297 --> 01:32:59.339]  The government is just rat-roach-eaten from end-to-end.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:08.725]  Big global corporations are so corrupt, they've endangered their own system by quadruple-leveraging-junk-bonds-AAA-rated.
[01:33:08.745 --> 01:33:13.829]  It's just pell-mell corruption, endless liquidity to buy everything up.
[01:33:14.769 --> 01:33:16.370]  Huge FEMA camps are built.
[01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:20.133]  They're poisoning the water, poisoning the food, carrying out eugenics against us.
[01:33:21.537 --> 01:33:22.778]  It's just light years.
[01:33:23.339 --> 01:33:24.800]  Light years ahead of what most people know.
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.221]  We got to have Peter Dale Scott back on.
[01:33:26.481 --> 01:33:28.322]  During the break, he said, oh, I'd love to come back on.
[01:33:28.342 --> 01:33:29.764]  This is the best interview I've ever been on.
[01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:32.125]  It's great to be on a show where somebody knows what they're talking about.
[01:33:32.566 --> 01:33:33.747]  See, he doesn't even look at my stuff.
[01:33:33.807 --> 01:33:34.968]  I don't even know how to look at his stuff.
[01:33:35.068 --> 01:33:36.169]  We say the exact same thing.
[01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:37.850]  Because it's the document.
[01:33:37.930 --> 01:33:40.312]  Same thing with Daniel Lester.
[01:33:40.332 --> 01:33:41.693]  Now, I do read quite a bit of his stuff.
[01:33:43.054 --> 01:33:46.737]  The point here is, we're telling you the facts.
[01:33:48.132 --> 01:33:51.895]  And now the San Francisco Chronicle admits the government has set up martial law.
[01:33:52.216 --> 01:33:55.118]  They've claimed that Congress has no authority and doesn't even matter.
[01:33:55.739 --> 01:34:00.723]  And that private corporations nexusing in with the president run everything.
[01:34:01.063 --> 01:34:02.905]  Now that's in-your-face martial law.
[01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:06.528]  And in Northcom's own statements, which Peter Del Scott read, these are public.
[01:34:06.548 --> 01:34:07.929]  Can you imagine what's secret?
[01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:11.352]  They said that bloggers' free speech is terrorism.
[01:34:11.392 --> 01:34:12.773]  They said it's a threat to the government.
[01:34:13.254 --> 01:34:14.595]  They must wage war on us.
[01:34:15.325 --> 01:34:16.466]  Our free speech is bad.
[01:34:16.546 --> 01:34:17.207]  In America!
[01:34:17.667 --> 01:34:19.990]  How far have you neocon followers slipped?
[01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:27.737]  Well, you hear Michael Savage and others get on air and say, criticizing the government is terrorism, because the government's fighting terrorists, and if you do that, you're a terrorist.
[01:34:28.117 --> 01:34:32.041]  And then we have all these Republican memos, where they come out and they say,
[01:34:33.247 --> 01:34:35.408]  Oh, we sure need another 9-11 attack.
[01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:36.529]  Oh, it'd be so good.
[01:34:37.049 --> 01:34:41.552]  State governors, state Republican Party chairs, top neocon writers.
[01:34:41.572 --> 01:34:46.735]  I mean, they write news articles saying 9-11 was sure good for the country, we sure needed that.
[01:34:46.755 --> 01:34:48.256]  It was good for you, you trash!
[01:34:49.036 --> 01:34:57.641]  And then, Gary Hart writes a letter to Iran saying, we staged the USS Remainer, Nevada, and the Gulf of Tonkin,
[01:34:58.484 --> 01:35:03.106]  For historians of American wars, the question is whether we provoke provocations or not.
[01:35:04.287 --> 01:35:09.429]  He goes on with just no veil to say, we stage events, Iran, you better do what we say.
[01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:14.552]  Don't just think because the polls show 80% are against the war that this isn't going to happen.
[01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:18.154]  We stage things.
[01:35:19.254 --> 01:35:22.456]  I mean, again, he knows that the general public doesn't read.
[01:35:22.956 --> 01:35:24.757]  He knows he can put that out in the newspaper.
[01:35:25.561 --> 01:35:28.263]  In a newspaper, just right out in the open.
[01:35:28.303 --> 01:35:31.645]  He helped write the whole Homeland Security architecture.
[01:35:32.586 --> 01:35:33.847]  With a heart-rubbing commission.
[01:35:36.508 --> 01:35:38.029]  For the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:35:40.951 --> 01:35:42.692]  Where they called for everything you see now.
[01:35:42.732 --> 01:35:44.854]  The total militarized takeover of America.
[01:35:45.154 --> 01:35:46.495]  The end of Posse Comitatus.
[01:35:46.515 --> 01:35:49.917]  And then they sit there without even a veil.
[01:35:49.937 --> 01:35:54.180]  And just wallow in who they are.
[01:35:56.681 --> 01:36:00.384]  It's like Peter L. Scott said, the professor earlier, this is all right out in the open now.
[01:36:01.265 --> 01:36:05.628]  Daniel Eskalon, it is always a great honor, his book now going into its fourth printing.
[01:36:07.114 --> 01:36:08.355]  It is sold out most places.
[01:36:08.415 --> 01:36:11.398]  We happen to have a couple hundred of them at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:11.819 --> 01:36:15.402]  Hundreds of photos, hundreds of documents, an incredible read.
[01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:16.904]  Read a chapter or two a night.
[01:36:16.924 --> 01:36:18.405]  You'll be an expert on the New World Order.
[01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:20.688]  Just unparalleled research.
[01:36:21.288 --> 01:36:22.830]  It is the Club Bilderberg.
[01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:28.175]  It is the book available at InfoWars.com, or better, bookstores everywhere.
[01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:30.638]  And I forgot to ask you, are you in Spain right now, Daniel?
[01:36:31.498 --> 01:36:31.978]  I'm in Spain.
[01:36:32.018 --> 01:36:32.859]  I'm in Madrid.
[01:36:32.959 --> 01:36:35.159]  I'll be coming to the United States in the next three weeks.
[01:36:35.179 --> 01:36:39.181]  I have about two weeks worth of tours across Western United States.
[01:36:39.221 --> 01:36:43.482]  There's such tremendous demand, Alex, for all that information, yours and mine.
[01:36:43.522 --> 01:36:45.423]  Again, I'm going to shamelessly promote your book.
[01:36:45.483 --> 01:36:49.965]  People, if you don't have Alex's latest DVD, I don't know what you're waiting for.
[01:36:49.985 --> 01:36:52.345]  You better get it if you want to understand how things run.
[01:36:52.386 --> 01:36:53.386]  You know what you just said?
[01:36:53.786 --> 01:36:59.268]  What a perspective for the future, all the things you talked about, martial law, starvation, et cetera, death.
[01:36:59.898 --> 01:37:04.642]  But you know, one of the things I'll do when I'm in the States is we have a big show in Portland.
[01:37:05.002 --> 01:37:07.945]  We just have to set them all straight and make sure people understand.
[01:37:07.985 --> 01:37:09.406]  We've got to connect the dots.
[01:37:09.966 --> 01:37:16.532]  Something that you do on a daily basis and needless to say, from Spain, on behalf of humanity, very grateful for all your work, Alex.
[01:37:17.156 --> 01:37:18.877]  No, Daniel, we're thankful to you.
[01:37:18.917 --> 01:37:23.659]  I mean, I know so many people in this movement who don't have their heads screwed on straight or it's about competition.
[01:37:23.699 --> 01:37:24.679]  It's about grandstanding.
[01:37:24.699 --> 01:37:32.263]  But when I'm with you personally, you know, and the time we've had to hang out, I mean, you have this grave attitude, you're focused, you realize
[01:37:33.477 --> 01:37:35.298]  And I want everybody else to have an attitude adjustment.
[01:37:35.778 --> 01:37:38.619]  You know, this isn't about who's got what bumper music on their show.
[01:37:38.659 --> 01:37:40.639]  This isn't about, you know, who did what.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:44.160]  This isn't about who the biggest or the baddest is in fighting the new world order.
[01:37:44.361 --> 01:37:45.741]  That's a dangerous position to be in.
[01:37:46.041 --> 01:37:47.662]  This is about survival.
[01:37:47.982 --> 01:37:57.885]  Daniel, I want to get into new developments you've learned about the Bilderberg agenda, new info you got out of some of the last conferences they've had, like Davos, where the agenda is going, where any fishers are at right now.
[01:37:59.026 --> 01:38:05.090]  Well, basically you're looking, again, one country, one world government, borderless, one currency, one constitution.
[01:38:28.628 --> 01:38:31.469]  Basically right by the same people, by the same men from behind the curtain.
[01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:35.891]  You're looking at something, a plan, which has been in motion for the past 600 years or so.
[01:38:35.992 --> 01:38:38.733]  It's the wholesale destruction of nation-states.
[01:38:38.813 --> 01:38:47.997]  Again, it goes back to the Council of Florence when the idea was to create nation-states, which is what the United States has always been the greatest nation-state on Earth.
[01:38:48.416 --> 01:38:55.617]  And for the past 600 years, and especially again looking at Europe, we have countries, constitutions, flags, borders, armies.
[01:38:55.877 --> 01:39:04.779]  Now you have one country called Europe, one constitution called the European Constitution, which, by the way, takes precedence over national constitutions.
[01:39:04.799 --> 01:39:07.559]  You have one currency, one border, one law.
[01:39:07.999 --> 01:39:13.140]  And needless to say, what they're doing right now is, again, they're working on the North American Constitution.
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:16.321]  And I know this for a fact because my sources are telling me that the men
[01:39:16.846 --> 01:39:31.737]  Behind the curtains, who's the, you know, the consummate bureaucrat who is helping the North American CFR elites to put it together, is the former Secretary General of NATO, a member of the Spanish Socialist Party, a member by the name of Javier Solana.
[01:39:32.157 --> 01:39:38.962]  So that's basically what Bilderberg is, one country, one world order, needless to say, working for them at our expense.
[01:39:39.023 --> 01:39:43.005]  It's not about us, it's about them, it's about getting power into fewer and fewer hands.
[01:39:43.025 --> 01:39:46.288]  And you're looking again at giant cartels,
[01:39:46.903 --> 01:39:52.608]  Whose objective is the creation of global elites more powerful than any nation on the planet.
[01:39:52.628 --> 01:39:58.433]  Which is why, again, they must destroy the greatest nation on the world, which is the United States.
[01:39:59.013 --> 01:40:02.416]  And while they do that, they claim they're doing all of this to save the U.S.
[01:40:02.496 --> 01:40:08.201]  while they destroy its economy, destroy its currency, destroy its borders, destroy its good name.
[01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:12.425]  I want to throw out a few little side issues that are important before I forget.
[01:40:13.115 --> 01:40:16.716]  Tony Blair, you said a year ago they plan to make him the head of Europe.
[01:40:17.056 --> 01:40:20.237]  He converted to Catholicism, with Europe being predominantly Catholic.
[01:40:20.257 --> 01:40:21.817]  That was a big sign eight months ago.
[01:40:22.637 --> 01:40:23.918]  It supposedly rotates.
[01:40:24.058 --> 01:40:29.139]  England isn't in line, but they break their own rules whenever they want, being dictatorial in nature.
[01:40:29.539 --> 01:40:31.880]  And now they're trying to position Blair into that.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:33.780]  He lied and said he wasn't planning it.
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:35.120]  Can you talk about Blair?
[01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:39.421]  Do you think he's going to get the EU presidency?
[01:40:39.781 --> 01:40:41.742]  Or do you think that there's so much
[01:40:42.622 --> 01:40:44.563]  Opposition mounting that they won't be able to do it?
[01:40:45.323 --> 01:40:50.704]  No, there's actually not a lot of opposition at all, because again, as in the United States, so is the case in Europe.
[01:40:50.784 --> 01:40:57.066]  The country, or the continent, has been so damned down, and especially now, with the subprime crisis hitting full effect.
[01:40:57.346 --> 01:41:00.887]  You know, you're talking about the worst banking crisis since 1931.
[01:41:01.567 --> 01:41:05.708]  People are just really not in the mood to hear anything other than their own personal finances.
[01:41:06.892 --> 01:41:19.780]  People don't understand quite yet is that the world financial system has already collapsed and what we're experiencing and will experience from now into the future are only the effects of it, which are gradually coming to the surface.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:26.984]  And again, there's not a lot of opposition to Tony Blair's probable most likely position as the European czar.
[01:41:27.044 --> 01:41:36.490]  And again, all the things that you're seeing right now, and again, you and I have talked about this, I remember in 2006 when we saw each other during Bilderberg Conference in Canada, in Ottawa,
[01:41:36.843 --> 01:41:39.725]  There's just so many predictions that you and I have been making over the years.
[01:41:40.045 --> 01:41:57.877]  I can't remember all of them, but you just told me, you know, you're right, I did say it about a year ago, I just couldn't remember it, because again, so much is happening so fast, and what before took six months to actually put together, now all of that is actually in warp run, it's being done literally in a matter of days.
[01:41:58.177 --> 01:42:00.359]  By the way, something just came out of Spain today.
[01:42:00.819 --> 01:42:06.043]  Citigroup have announced that as of now, people will only be able to withdraw
[01:42:07.445 --> 01:42:09.628]  10,000 euros a month.
[01:42:09.788 --> 01:42:12.712]  2,000 euros a day and maximum 10,000 euros a month.
[01:42:12.752 --> 01:42:15.076]  That is huge financial news.
[01:42:15.176 --> 01:42:17.920]  That basically means around the bank right there.
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.723]  That means they're preempting some news.
[01:42:20.974 --> 01:42:26.016]  Well, again, it's not going to come out publicly, but it has come out.
[01:42:26.076 --> 01:42:33.119]  It's in a trial balloon, and it has come out on a few Spanish financial websites, but again, it disappeared almost as quickly.
[01:42:33.159 --> 01:42:35.120]  But again, it makes almost sense in the world.
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:40.762]  You know, if you look at it in Europe, for example, it's literally a domino effect.
[01:42:40.802 --> 01:42:43.303]  What is happening in the United States is a subprime crisis.
[01:42:43.623 --> 01:42:46.284]  Well, it's in full gear right now in Europe, yes.
[01:42:46.804 --> 01:42:47.144]  I think?
[01:43:16.974 --> 01:43:31.660]  Again, you see it all the way back in August 2007, when there was a credit crunch, when the lending between the banks almost came completely to a halt in Europe, as a so-called reverse leverage collapse began through this process.
[01:43:32.082 --> 01:43:33.023]  We're good to go.
[01:43:48.403 --> 01:43:54.026]  And you said the elite are popping the subprime to cause this spiraling slide.
[01:43:54.347 --> 01:44:02.131]  You said it would be a long, slow slide so that they can consolidate everything, and then it would be made to look like it happened on accident.
[01:44:02.231 --> 01:44:07.074]  Exactly what you said, because you were getting it from sources inside Bilderberg.
[01:44:07.294 --> 01:44:08.155]  What are those sources?
[01:44:08.995 --> 01:44:10.376]  I'm going to give you another piece of information.
[01:44:10.416 --> 01:44:12.337]  You know, something which is coming together again right now.
[01:44:12.377 --> 01:44:13.958]  I saw this about ten years ago.
[01:44:14.423 --> 01:44:14.783]  I don't know.
[01:44:30.262 --> 01:44:39.990]  Shortly after Canada, I saw, again, demand destruction in a Club of Rome report, and about three months later, in a trilateral paper report, and then I saw it in the European Commission report.
[01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:43.212]  So I asked a friend of mine in the World Bank, I said, what does this mean?
[01:44:43.252 --> 01:44:44.974]  And he said, how do you destroy the demand?
[01:44:44.994 --> 01:44:46.775]  I said to him, well, how do you do this?
[01:44:46.795 --> 01:44:58.745]  He said, you destroy the demand by destroying the world economy, because poor people, you know, the great unwashed, us, the rest of humanity, you know, they can destroy us, they can take away whatever little we have,
[01:44:59.252 --> 01:45:06.857]  Just as in the 1929 supposed crash, it wasn't a crash, it was a transfer of wealth and people better understand it.
[01:45:07.217 --> 01:45:08.698]  We lost, they gained.
[01:45:08.778 --> 01:45:10.940]  The same thing is being done right now.
[01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:16.764]  The giant corporations, these giant cartels which form part of the Bilderberg inner circle,
[01:45:17.324 --> 01:45:18.945]  Spider Web of Virtual Interest.
[01:45:19.265 --> 01:45:23.427]  They'll be able to buy, for pennies on the dollar, anything out there.
[01:45:23.547 --> 01:45:25.087]  It's a great fire sale.
[01:45:25.427 --> 01:45:28.749]  And needless to say, we, the people, will be suffering.
[01:45:28.789 --> 01:45:34.271]  But again, we should ask ourselves why nobody's talking about it in the U.S.
[01:45:34.491 --> 01:45:35.772]  presidential races.
[01:45:37.904 --> 01:45:40.226]  They're not talking about any of the serious issues.
[01:45:40.806 --> 01:45:47.191]  Shifting gears back out of banking, Daniel Esselin, and coming up in the next hour, folks, you'll be able to talk to Daniel and call in and ask your questions at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:45:47.211 --> 01:45:48.092]  Investigative journalist.
[01:45:56.187 --> 01:45:57.808]  He's in my film, Endgame.
[01:45:57.848 --> 01:46:00.670]  He has a best-selling book, now in its fourth printing here in the U.S.
[01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:03.932]  It's been in as many as 20 printings in other nations, 25-plus nations.
[01:46:04.893 --> 01:46:06.654]  I think that number has grown.
[01:46:06.674 --> 01:46:07.855]  50 countries, Alex.
[01:46:07.895 --> 01:46:11.597]  We just sold the rights to our 50th country and our 30th language.
[01:46:11.738 --> 01:46:12.798]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:46:13.219 --> 01:46:19.223]  It's the people leading this fight, and I think we can win this war if we can just wake up from our drunken stupor.
[01:46:20.123 --> 01:46:20.624]  Absolutely.
[01:46:20.684 --> 01:46:22.345]  So, in the last year, it's doubled.
[01:46:22.405 --> 01:46:23.445]  That's just incredible.
[01:46:23.786 --> 01:46:24.126]  Daniel,
[01:46:24.935 --> 01:46:27.237]  We know on one arm they've got the war on terror.
[01:46:27.297 --> 01:46:31.240]  That's how they dominate us, arrest us, control us, push us around.
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.461]  That's their excuse.
[01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:37.064]  But on the other hand, they use this whole push of global warming, man-made global warming.
[01:46:37.384 --> 01:46:54.157]  They're going to say how big your house can be, how much food you can have, remote control thermostats in your house, banning fireworks in the EU, even if local governments want to put them on, banning outside space heaters, banning fireplaces, taxing and regulating your cows, your sheep,
[01:46:54.797 --> 01:47:02.961]  Well, I can give you a very, very concrete example, which I did see in a Club of Rome report about six months ago or so, and about two weeks ago as I was preparing, started preparing for my show in the United States.
[01:47:24.304 --> 01:47:28.205]  I got information from my sources in the Ministry of Agriculture in Canada.
[01:47:28.545 --> 01:47:39.109]  What they're basically trying to do, they're trying to destroy an independent watchdog organization which makes sure that the people don't get ripped off by the big agribusiness.
[01:47:39.631 --> 01:47:48.576]  And that's again, that's part of the entire agenda of control, and what they're trying to do, they're trying to destroy what's called the Canadian Grain Commission, whose annual budget is about $15 million.
[01:47:49.016 --> 01:47:55.240]  It's the only thing in Canada that stands in the way of total corporate control over grading and prices.
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:48:00.983]  And what basically they're doing, they're trying to eliminate it to be able to directly control it, and investigating it,
[01:48:01.443 --> 01:48:15.749]  I've realized that all the way down from the Minister of Agriculture of Canada, down to the people who supposedly put together independent reports for the Club of Rome, are the same individuals who are actually doing this and trying to destroy it.
[01:48:15.889 --> 01:48:19.870]  The Minister of Agriculture of Canada is a guy by the name of Jerry Ritt.
[01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:26.393]  He used to be a chairman of Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Foods and was part of Agri-Business.
[01:48:26.793 --> 01:48:42.403]  And again, it's all part of the global agenda, because as you know, as Kissinger said, you control the energy, you control the nations, you control the food, you control the people, and it's again, we the people are the only ones who are standing in the way of total control over all of these resources and our lives.
[01:48:42.784 --> 01:48:46.626]  They need control of food and they must control the water, and that's what they're doing.
[01:48:46.666 --> 01:48:49.368]  And again, it all comes out of the Club of Rome reports.
[01:48:49.970 --> 01:48:57.976]  Needless to say, they talked about it at the Bilderberg Annual Meeting in 2007 in Istanbul, and of course they'll be talking about it in 2008.
[01:48:58.016 --> 01:49:01.639]  Now I want to explain this.
[01:49:01.759 --> 01:49:02.740]  They're monopoly men.
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:03.740]  They're not free market.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:10.826]  If they get control of industries through regulation, if they get control of governments through global, international treaties and bodies,
[01:49:11.562 --> 01:49:16.947]  And we just had Gordon Brown call for a world government, a world army with NATO at the head.
[01:49:17.388 --> 01:49:18.929]  It's all happening.
[01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:27.698]  What do you say to people that listen to this show and giggle and snivel and send me emails and laugh and say we're crazy when all we're doing is reporting what they're doing, Daniel?
[01:49:28.547 --> 01:49:30.788]  Alex, you know, I'll give you an example with Titanic.
[01:49:30.828 --> 01:49:31.268]  It's too late.
[01:49:31.308 --> 01:49:32.568]  We know this thing is going to crash.
[01:49:32.588 --> 01:49:34.509]  We know it's going to hit an iceberg and it's going to sink.
[01:49:34.929 --> 01:49:37.229]  There is no time to speak to six billion people.
[01:49:37.269 --> 01:49:41.430]  We only have to pick and choose the people who are willing to listen and willing to participate.
[01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:43.271]  We don't want all these people on board.
[01:49:43.291 --> 01:49:44.311]  We don't want dead weight.
[01:49:44.351 --> 01:49:48.052]  We only want the people who understand that the only way we can... Stay there.
[01:49:48.272 --> 01:49:48.652]  Stay there.
[01:49:49.012 --> 01:49:49.432]  Got a break.
[01:49:49.472 --> 01:49:50.533]  Finish up with Daniel Osmond.
[01:49:50.573 --> 01:49:50.973]  Stay with us.
[01:49:50.993 --> 01:49:51.433]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.059 --> 01:49:55.700]  American needs Ron Paul.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:59.263]  There are numerous ways to show your support for him, and a better America.
[01:49:59.443 --> 01:50:03.345]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[01:50:03.525 --> 01:50:06.447]  That's why we have created RonPaulFlags.com.
[01:50:06.607 --> 01:50:14.573]  RonPaulFlags.com produces some of the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president of our ailing country.
[01:50:14.793 --> 01:50:20.657]  Standard flags are 3 feet by 5 feet, and custom flags can be as large as 30 feet by 50 feet.
[01:50:20.817 --> 01:50:23.899]  Our most popular flags are Ron Paul, president in Ohio.
[01:50:23.899 --> 01:50:24.599]  We're good to go!
[01:50:54.182 --> 01:51:06.906]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:14.069]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:51:14.429 --> 01:51:18.011]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:18.392 --> 01:51:21.574]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:21.794 --> 01:51:23.515]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:51:23.555 --> 01:51:29.298]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:51:29.699 --> 01:51:33.281]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com.
[01:51:33.621 --> 01:51:34.122]  We're good to go.
[01:51:53.931 --> 01:52:02.314]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:52:02.634 --> 01:52:08.316]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[01:52:08.616 --> 01:52:15.158]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[01:52:15.718 --> 01:52:19.000]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:21.342]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:52:21.562 --> 01:52:27.926]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum-packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[01:52:28.166 --> 01:52:31.468]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[01:52:47.763 --> 01:52:49.508]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[01:52:57.026 --> 01:52:58.347]  I got my wires crossed.
[01:52:58.387 --> 01:53:07.694]  Daniel's only going to be with us five minutes into the next hour, but I'm going to have him up for a full hour next week ahead of his trip to the United States, and we'll talk about all those events and dates then.
[01:53:08.274 --> 01:53:18.322]  I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com, the new, redesigned, upgraded InfoWars.com, and via the safe, secure online video and bookstore shopping cart, get the true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:53:18.999 --> 01:53:23.382]  Since 1954, the world's most powerful people have met in secret once a year until now.
[01:53:23.862 --> 01:53:25.123]  And it is the definitive work.
[01:53:25.303 --> 01:53:27.504]  It is hundreds of photos, hundreds of documents.
[01:53:28.004 --> 01:53:29.465]  I mean, every page is illustrated.
[01:53:29.565 --> 01:53:30.046]  Every page.
[01:53:30.066 --> 01:53:33.708]  This is such a well-done book, and it's such powerful information.
[01:53:33.788 --> 01:53:37.210]  I hope you'll get it at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:53:41.372 --> 01:53:46.613]  And I agree, if somebody laughs at you, move on, but we should still try to wake up others, especially prominent people.
[01:53:47.493 --> 01:53:50.974]  And Daniel, I mean, would you encourage people to give your book to skeptics?
[01:53:51.834 --> 01:54:03.437]  Because I don't know, I mean, this is so important, but I also agree with you that we're in such crisis, I don't get how people laugh and smile about this when even mainstream media admits we're going into a global crisis.
[01:54:04.366 --> 01:54:10.489]  Well, Alex, again, with four basic pieces of proof, irrefutable evidence, people still don't believe.
[01:54:10.569 --> 01:54:13.150]  It doesn't matter if you give them $400,000 or $400 million.
[01:54:13.591 --> 01:54:14.671]  Again, the drug crisis.
[01:54:14.691 --> 01:54:19.353]  People believe it's drug traffickers in South America who control the drug trade.
[01:54:19.393 --> 01:54:25.216]  They don't understand that it's the biggest corporations in the world who are the ones who are profiting from the international drug trade.
[01:54:25.496 --> 01:54:28.258]  And all that money is being washed and laundered through Wall Street again.
[01:54:28.778 --> 01:54:40.042]  If people don't understand, the question is, do we waste our time trying to convince them, which takes a lot of time and a lot of energy, or do we go after the people, you know, who are half-believers, and we get them on board?
[01:54:40.182 --> 01:54:40.923]  I don't really know.
[01:54:41.283 --> 01:54:43.644]  I think there's simply not enough time.
[01:54:43.664 --> 01:54:51.947]  You know, as Peter Dale Scott said, as you said, and I said, so many other people out there, knowledgeable people who understand, we're at the end of a financial system.
[01:54:51.987 --> 01:54:57.929]  We're experiencing a systemic collapse of the financial markets and of civilization as we know it.
[01:54:58.456 --> 01:55:04.681]  If people don't understand it and they prefer to watch football games and hockey games and all that other jazz, that's fine.
[01:55:05.142 --> 01:55:06.283]  Don't have the time for them.
[01:55:06.343 --> 01:55:07.263]  It's a Titanic.
[01:55:07.303 --> 01:55:10.706]  We talk to the people who understand and we get them on board.
[01:55:10.986 --> 01:55:12.247]  We don't need that many people.
[01:55:12.588 --> 01:55:18.232]  If we can get 10, 20, 30 million people to understand, that's a big enough force to win this war.
[01:55:18.873 --> 01:55:19.573]  Absolutely.
[01:55:19.854 --> 01:55:24.217]  Daniel, on the time we've got left in this segment and the next, any new intel on their agenda?
[01:55:24.317 --> 01:55:25.058]  Any splits?
[01:55:25.198 --> 01:55:27.300]  What happened at Davos behind the scenes?
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:49.820]  Well, you know, I can tell you one thing, that going back to the American elections, which I think interests a lot the people in the United States, you know, I've been saying it for months, that my candidate is Michael Bloomberg, it's not McCain, who probably is not going to live long enough to enjoy, because he's a very, very sick man, and needless to say, Barack Obama has been compromised, and Hillary Clinton
[01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:53.773]  He's hated in London and in most circles in the United States as well.
[01:55:54.233 --> 01:55:58.877]  I think it's Bloomberg, but there's something else which came out recently that I saw a few days ago.
[01:55:59.297 --> 01:56:03.060]  They're talking about a potential Bloomberg-Obama ticket.
[01:56:03.613 --> 01:56:16.123]  And now, it has been actually floated by this woman by the name of Armstrong Williams on the site called Newsmax.com, I think about three or four days ago, they're talking about Obama the Independent.
[01:56:16.563 --> 01:56:20.787]  By the way, Armstrong Williams has been on the White House payroll with fake news.
[01:56:21.927 --> 01:56:22.428]  Exactly.
[01:56:22.468 --> 01:56:26.053]  But, you know, this is one of the things which is... Well, listen, listen, listen.
[01:56:26.073 --> 01:56:33.643]  I agree with you because now Bloomberg's coming out supporting Obama and talking about Hillary trying to cheat him in New York with votes.
[01:56:33.683 --> 01:56:33.984]  Go ahead.
[01:56:34.782 --> 01:56:35.162]  Exactly.
[01:56:35.182 --> 01:56:45.169]  Well, Bloomberg, you know, apparently is prepared to give $1 billion to Obama's campaign, after which Obama would vote from the Democratic Party and run as an independent.
[01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:50.993]  Again, a lot of people don't quite understand that it doesn't matter if the election process started months ago.
[01:56:51.314 --> 01:56:58.439]  As an independent, you can run whenever you want, and Bloomberg has $11 billion of his own cash to spend on the campaign.
[01:56:59.719 --> 01:57:00.980]  It's about money, Alex.
[01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:03.783]  And you have to understand, it's what my friend in the World Bank told me.
[01:57:03.803 --> 01:57:11.930]  He said, if you want to understand how this is done and what the elites are doing to us, understand how money works and what money can do for us if you know how to use it.
[01:57:11.950 --> 01:57:16.394]  Now, Daniel, are you saying you're getting this from sources inside the power structure?
[01:57:18.175 --> 01:57:26.683]  I'm getting it from the people who are at Davos and who heard others talking in, you know, small talk, idle chatter during lunches and dinners.
[01:57:27.051 --> 01:57:29.913]  But people, again, were involved in the American government, so... Stay there!
[01:57:29.973 --> 01:57:30.434]  Stay there!
[01:57:30.454 --> 01:57:30.734]  Stay there!
[01:57:30.754 --> 01:57:31.194]  We got a break.
[01:57:31.254 --> 01:57:31.535]  One minute.
[01:57:31.575 --> 01:57:34.757]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:36.158 --> 01:57:37.719]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:50.309]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.509 --> 01:57:51.150]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.810 --> 01:57:52.891]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.592 --> 01:57:54.693]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.353 --> 01:57:56.114]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.906 --> 01:57:57.787]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.807 --> 01:58:02.070]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:06.753]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.815 --> 01:58:12.537]  Big news coming up in the next segment after Daniel leaves us.
[01:58:13.378 --> 01:58:17.321]  I'm also going to be opening the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:18.262 --> 01:58:21.524]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group, Daniel Estelin.
[01:58:22.805 --> 01:58:24.066]  Daniel continuing show.
[01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:29.092]  Alitas, the info you got at Davos, the buzz is Bloomberg and Obama.
[01:58:29.876 --> 01:58:35.779]  And you're saying that's being jockeyed around, or you think from the info you got that that's definitely in the cards?
[01:58:36.279 --> 01:58:39.000]  Well, somebody's talking about it, Alex, which is how I get the information.
[01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:40.541]  Eugene, somebody's talking about this.
[01:58:40.861 --> 01:58:41.601]  Somebody is in the know.
[01:58:41.641 --> 01:58:46.643]  I've been talking about Bloomberg candidacy since October, since I was in the States the first time to promote my book.
[01:58:47.024 --> 01:58:48.704]  And again, it makes all the sense in the world.
[01:58:48.764 --> 01:58:49.765]  It's about money.
[01:58:50.085 --> 01:58:56.848]  And the situation is such a disastrous situation right now that the bankers themselves, they need to put their guy in the White House
[01:58:57.199 --> 01:59:06.284]  To be able to control the situation and the Obamas and the McCains and the Clintons, they just don't have the financial savvy and smarts to know what to do.
[01:59:06.464 --> 01:59:13.727]  And someone such as Michael Bloomberg, who himself is a money man, is again the banker's choice for the White House.
[01:59:13.887 --> 01:59:15.008]  I wouldn't be surprised at all.
[01:59:15.148 --> 01:59:17.269]  I thought it would be Bloomberg all the way.
[01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:21.731]  Now they're talking about a Bloomberg candidacy in the United States mainstream press.
[01:59:22.112 --> 01:59:24.353]  So again, I think it's a possibility.
[01:59:24.373 --> 01:59:26.874]  I think it's a little bit too early to tell, but I think it's...
[01:59:27.518 --> 01:59:27.958]  In the cards.
[01:59:28.339 --> 01:59:28.999]  Anything else?
[01:59:29.479 --> 01:59:30.980]  Iran's still off the table.
[01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:32.221]  What about stage terror?
[01:59:32.501 --> 01:59:34.362]  In the three minutes we've got, you've got the floor.
[01:59:34.522 --> 01:59:36.063]  Any other key info you've got?
[01:59:36.983 --> 01:59:45.568]  Well, I think, again, you know, this is a message to all the people out there listening to the show and the new audience which you have in the last few weeks and a few months.
[01:59:45.996 --> 02:00:03.458]  We're talking not about a Bilderberg group, but we're talking about a very powerful group of people, the oligarchy, which is essentially a private criminal enterprise stretching across the globe and operating through a network of government agencies, private institutions, and both publicly owned and private corporations.
[02:00:03.928 --> 02:00:31.253]  And again, it's important to understand that we're talking about a self-perpetuating system, a virtual spiderweb of interlocked financial, political, economic, and industry systems, again, with a very set model at the center, which is the Bilderberg Group, which is, again, one of the reasons why all of these individuals keep coming back again and again and again, because these are the same people, the Kissingers, the Sutherlands, the Etienne d'Avignon, the Rockefellers, the Brzezinskis,
[02:00:31.673 --> 02:00:37.196]  They are in all of these things, and again, that's how this oligarchy actually works.
[02:00:39.217 --> 02:00:42.498]  The Kissingers, the Rockefellers haven't relinquished their power yet.
[02:00:43.018 --> 02:00:45.559]  They're losing a lot of their luster and sparkle.
[02:00:45.599 --> 02:00:47.440]  They want to see their new world order be born.
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:52.142]  Does that mean that they're trying to accelerate things, or is there a power transfer starting to happen?
[02:00:52.783 --> 02:00:55.544]  Well, you know, let me tell you, I'm very frank with you.
[02:00:55.664 --> 02:00:59.746]  These people are going to be long dead and buried before their plans for the new world order come to pass.
[02:01:00.246 --> 02:01:04.669]  Thanks to the work you do, the work I do, and the work that people are finally beginning to wake up.
[02:01:04.769 --> 02:01:08.831]  Not enough people, but enough people to slow them down considerably.
[02:01:08.931 --> 02:01:16.715]  Again, the information that we're able to get out to the people is enough to derail some of their plans, and that's exactly what we need.
[02:01:17.055 --> 02:01:18.216]  I don't think they're losing their roster.
[02:01:18.256 --> 02:01:19.857]  I think, again, they still are in control.
[02:01:20.839 --> 02:01:32.206]  I think it's a very organized financial meltdown, but again, as in any crisis, you need to control the situation, and they don't control all the elements, which is, again, one of the advantages that we have.
[02:01:32.566 --> 02:01:35.087]  They don't control the entire system, only most of it.
[02:01:37.249 --> 02:01:39.810]  And people are starting to wake up to the world government, aren't they?
[02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:41.131]  Does that concern the elite?
[02:01:42.463 --> 02:01:45.124]  Well, you know, it's a very relative thing.
[02:01:45.164 --> 02:01:53.448]  Again, my book has sold over a million and a half copies in the world, but how many millions watched the final of the NFL, you know, the Super Bowl?
[02:01:53.468 --> 02:01:55.449]  Was it 30, 40, 50 million people?
[02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:56.689]  It's a very relative thing.
[02:01:56.709 --> 02:02:04.253]  Again, 2 million people is a lot of people, but 50 million people sitting in front of the boob tube watching a football game eating popcorn is a lot more people.
[02:02:06.054 --> 02:02:06.674]  Absolutely.
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:08.880]  Well, I know this.
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:09.740]  We don't have a choice.
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:10.961]  All we can do is fight back.
[02:02:11.001 --> 02:02:12.781]  We can't just lay here in the gutter and give up.
[02:02:13.161 --> 02:02:14.201]  He's coming to the U.S.
[02:02:14.261 --> 02:02:14.721]  next month.
[02:02:14.741 --> 02:02:23.643]  He'll be back home with us next Friday for a full hour to tell you about some of the places he's going to be and a lot of other developments and information we haven't had time to cover.
[02:02:23.663 --> 02:02:30.504]  Maybe we'll go back into history, too, with Lord Milner and extrapolate out how they really codified this modern plan that we're living under.
[02:02:31.044 --> 02:02:35.085]  Next week, I promise to get the information from the Davos Forum for you, Alex.
[02:02:35.771 --> 02:02:36.511]  Fantastic!
[02:02:36.551 --> 02:02:38.531]  He's the author of... We'll do it exclusively on your show.
[02:02:39.072 --> 02:02:40.132]  Fantastic, Daniel.
[02:02:40.152 --> 02:02:40.492]  Be safe.
[02:02:40.512 --> 02:02:41.472]  We'll talk to you next week.
[02:02:42.092 --> 02:02:42.372]  Great.
[02:02:42.472 --> 02:02:42.952]  God bless you.
[02:02:42.972 --> 02:02:43.332]  Take care.
[02:02:43.572 --> 02:02:43.992]  Take care.

[02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:47.820]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.584]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:03:51.745 --> 02:03:53.667]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:03:53.687 --> 02:03:56.950]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:03:57.271 --> 02:04:02.777]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:04:03.057 --> 02:04:07.002]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:04:07.322 --> 02:04:12.266]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:04:12.546 --> 02:04:15.328]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:04:44.631 --> 02:04:45.371]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:04:47.757 --> 02:04:51.139]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:56.483]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:04:56.683 --> 02:05:01.487]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:05:01.747 --> 02:05:12.855]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[02:05:51.326 --> 02:05:53.047]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.728 --> 02:05:54.849]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.489 --> 02:05:56.310]  You want answers?
[02:05:57.071 --> 02:05:57.971]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.632 --> 02:06:02.555]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.815 --> 02:06:06.879]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.119 --> 02:06:15.222]  Rachel, David, Aaron, Stacey, Scott, we're going to all of you in about three minutes.
[02:06:18.884 --> 02:06:21.545]  Indonesia thinks that the birds lose a bio-weapon.
[02:06:21.565 --> 02:06:25.688]  Well, we already knew that, but now the government's talking about it as the truth begins to come out.
[02:06:26.228 --> 02:06:27.428]  We'll get into that as well.
[02:06:28.809 --> 02:06:31.831]  Before I go to your calls, I got this email, and I don't know if this is true.
[02:06:31.871 --> 02:06:33.051]  I got this five minutes ago.
[02:06:33.071 --> 02:06:34.072]  I was reading through some email.
[02:06:35.091 --> 02:06:38.954]  Trey brought it into me, a big stack of it, and I was going through it.
[02:06:39.495 --> 02:06:40.916]  We all read what you send in.
[02:06:42.857 --> 02:06:50.143]  And I did some googling and couldn't find it, but I believe the email I've been sent.
[02:06:51.584 --> 02:06:54.587]  Only because I've seen the exact same stuff here in Austin, Texas.
[02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:59.891]  And it's just an amazing example of total police state.
[02:07:00.797 --> 02:07:01.877]  And color of love.
[02:07:02.018 --> 02:07:03.598]  So let me just read you this email.
[02:07:03.618 --> 02:07:05.039]  And the person gave me their full name.
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:10.101]  They don't say don't give their name, but I'm still not going to give it.
[02:07:10.201 --> 02:07:14.462]  But if Darren M. That's his last name.
[02:07:16.063 --> 02:07:17.384]  That's the initial of his last name.
[02:07:17.424 --> 02:07:19.364]  If Darren M. can get in on the line.
[02:07:19.384 --> 02:07:23.106]  I know the lines are loaded right now, but when you hear a caller hang up, try to call in.
[02:07:23.126 --> 02:07:28.608]  If Darren M. wants to call in and tell this story or anybody else
[02:07:29.255 --> 02:07:30.376]  Who's had this happen to them?
[02:07:30.396 --> 02:07:31.697]  Because I know this goes on.
[02:07:32.698 --> 02:07:34.320]  I know it's expanding all over the country.
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:36.882]  But I don't know about Abilene, Texas.
[02:07:37.923 --> 02:07:38.604]  Now listen to this.
[02:07:38.704 --> 02:07:39.144]  Comments.
[02:07:40.105 --> 02:07:41.927]  Below is the result of your feedback form.
[02:07:41.967 --> 02:07:45.870]  It was submitted by Darren M. on Tuesday, February 5th.
[02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:50.274]  It's now, of course, continuing here.
[02:07:50.314 --> 02:07:51.916]  It says, My 16-year-old son
[02:07:53.018 --> 02:07:55.341]  Got in some trouble yesterday for talking in class.
[02:07:55.421 --> 02:07:58.584]  He was not asked to write sentences or to stay after school.
[02:07:58.624 --> 02:08:01.948]  He did not receive a notice to take home to his parents.
[02:08:02.208 --> 02:08:05.191]  No sir, he received a citation, a ticket.
[02:08:05.331 --> 02:08:13.560]  He will appear, he will have to appear at the Taylor County Courthouse sometime during next week and there will be, will be a possible fine.
[02:08:14.501 --> 02:08:15.682]  Let me explain that in a minute.
[02:08:16.249 --> 02:08:23.575]  When my son expressed his shock and amazement over such a drastic punishment, they told him to get over it because it's not that big of a deal.
[02:08:23.635 --> 02:08:30.420]  In fact, said the faculty member, handing him the citation, this is the fifth ticket I've handed out today.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:31.761]  I'm completely blown away.
[02:08:34.324 --> 02:08:36.245]  Now let me just walk through this first.
[02:08:37.626 --> 02:08:41.109]  A, only a police officer can give you a ticket.
[02:08:42.814 --> 02:08:48.936]  Lockheed Martin, the big defense contractor in San Diego, was caught shortening yellow lights, more than doubling the amount of accidents.
[02:08:49.756 --> 02:08:50.856]  Deaths resulted, by the way.
[02:08:51.356 --> 02:08:58.138]  Shortening yellow lights from four seconds down to two, because they wanted you to run through it, even a foot, over the line, which we all do all the time.
[02:08:58.158 --> 02:09:00.679]  You know, those things come on quick, you gotta slam your brakes on.
[02:09:01.559 --> 02:09:02.419]  I don't run red lights.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.180]  It's dangerous, not to mention I don't want the ticket.
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:09.941]  You slam your brakes on, and the people will slide out, and the intersection wrecks.
[02:09:10.782 --> 02:09:12.002]  But that isn't what beat them in court.
[02:09:13.064 --> 02:09:15.425]  In San Diego, five years ago, it got removed there.
[02:09:15.465 --> 02:09:21.769]  Another company put another system in because Lockheed Martin, with no officer, was just using the photo cameras to give you tickets.
[02:09:21.789 --> 02:09:22.990]  And they've lost all over the country.
[02:09:23.330 --> 02:09:23.970]  They don't care.
[02:09:24.171 --> 02:09:26.752]  One red light camera can make five plus million dollars.
[02:09:27.372 --> 02:09:28.513]  They've made more than that before.
[02:09:28.813 --> 02:09:30.854]  So they'll just fight the tickets, fight it in court.
[02:09:30.914 --> 02:09:31.755]  The cattle don't know.
[02:09:31.815 --> 02:09:32.355]  They don't care.
[02:09:32.535 --> 02:09:33.476]  Doesn't matter if it's criminal.
[02:09:34.296 --> 02:09:35.217]  But, here's the deal.
[02:09:37.058 --> 02:09:39.059]  A teacher can't give you a ticket.
[02:09:39.119 --> 02:09:40.380]  She can call a cop,
[02:09:41.289 --> 02:09:51.913]  And then if he sees something like drugs or violence, or something that's illegal, that's in the criminal code of the law of the state, then he can do something.
[02:09:52.393 --> 02:09:55.875]  A teacher, they can't just suddenly say, it's illegal to talk.
[02:09:55.975 --> 02:10:04.698]  Now, that said, the schools are induction centers to get your children either on welfare, in psychiatric care, or in prison.
[02:10:05.501 --> 02:10:06.662]  That's in the federal documents.
[02:10:06.982 --> 02:10:08.903]  We've got the number two Department of Education.
[02:10:08.923 --> 02:10:10.324]  I mean, she ran the thing.
[02:10:10.364 --> 02:10:11.364]  Had a policy on.
[02:10:11.404 --> 02:10:12.365]  She has the documents.
[02:10:12.405 --> 02:10:13.185]  We carry it now.
[02:10:13.625 --> 02:10:14.526]  Deliberate dumbing down.
[02:10:14.546 --> 02:10:16.207]  The book weighs like eight pounds or something.
[02:10:16.227 --> 02:10:17.627]  It's the size of the Dallas phone book.
[02:10:18.228 --> 02:10:19.328]  I mean, this is the plan.
[02:10:19.468 --> 02:10:20.369]  It's systematic.
[02:10:20.469 --> 02:10:21.189]  It's sinister.
[02:10:21.549 --> 02:10:22.890]  The teachers and cops don't know.
[02:10:22.930 --> 02:10:25.612]  They're compartmentalized and brainwashed like the rest of us.
[02:10:26.832 --> 02:10:28.273]  To get your children into prison.
[02:10:28.293 --> 02:10:29.314]  To get them into the system.
[02:10:29.334 --> 02:10:30.234]  To get them on drugs.
[02:10:31.094 --> 02:10:32.315]  That is, the prescription drugs.
[02:10:32.335 --> 02:10:33.836]  Get them on welfare one way or the other.
[02:10:35.001 --> 02:10:38.683]  So, when you leave school, you won't have the rights of someone who isn't a felon.
[02:10:39.244 --> 02:10:42.706]  Either you're mentally ill, you're on welfare, or you're in a prison system.
[02:10:44.107 --> 02:10:49.950]  Now, here in Austin, Texas, with the ASAP program, starting in 1998, and we got them sued, and they had to back off.
[02:10:49.970 --> 02:10:52.212]  I mean, we went down there and stopped the program.
[02:10:52.532 --> 02:10:55.314]  By the way, though, years later, they crept back with it, and it's back.
[02:10:55.374 --> 02:10:56.694]  I don't have time to go fight it myself.
[02:10:57.095 --> 02:10:57.695]  You're welcome to.
[02:10:57.715 --> 02:10:59.977]  I used to have to go to the County Commissioner's Court every week.
[02:11:00.337 --> 02:11:02.138]  We had to get parents to file lawsuits.
[02:11:02.842 --> 02:11:03.402]  And we beat it.
[02:11:03.542 --> 02:11:05.683]  Now, it's a federally written, mandated program.
[02:11:05.703 --> 02:11:06.603]  They get money for it.
[02:11:06.964 --> 02:11:09.284]  It's got different names, different areas, but this is what happens.
[02:11:10.825 --> 02:11:14.186]  You are late to class three times.
[02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:16.627]  You are charged with criminal truancy.
[02:11:16.667 --> 02:11:17.447]  Now, let me say that again.
[02:11:19.368 --> 02:11:23.570]  The state law at the time said 14 truancies in a semester.
[02:11:24.170 --> 02:11:27.531]  Unexcused criminal truancy kicks in on the child and the parents.
[02:11:30.831 --> 02:11:40.575]  We would go down and say, here's the law, but we had local newscasts about it, we went and shot video of people's houses where it happened, parents who heard about it on the TV show and radio show were waiting with cameras.
[02:11:43.417 --> 02:11:54.982]  If your child was late to class three times, they would count that as one truancy, they would file, they would claim criminal charges, then they would bring in false charges that violated state code,
[02:11:55.876 --> 02:12:04.883]  And they even built on to all the high schools and middle schools, portable buildings that have judges in them, and they call the ignorant parents in, who have no idea about which way is up.
[02:12:05.403 --> 02:12:07.525]  And Judge Jean Meir was on local CBS News.
[02:12:07.545 --> 02:12:08.766]  We ought to find that video and play it here.
[02:12:08.786 --> 02:12:09.747]  We played it on local TV.
[02:12:10.968 --> 02:12:13.370]  And she was just grandstanding for television.
[02:12:13.410 --> 02:12:14.591]  She's the head family court judge.
[02:12:14.611 --> 02:12:15.812]  It's not even a real court system.
[02:12:16.052 --> 02:12:17.032]  It's all color of law.
[02:12:17.833 --> 02:12:18.974]  But she isn't normally there.
[02:12:19.374 --> 02:12:21.476]  She was just there to grandstand for CBS cameras.
[02:12:22.396 --> 02:12:25.159]  And it shows the young, uh, eleven-year-old.
[02:12:25.619 --> 02:12:28.401]  He has missed class once, been late three times.
[02:12:28.842 --> 02:12:35.107]  She points her finger and she goes, you're going to juvenile hall, you're going to spend months in jail the next time you do this.
[02:12:35.127 --> 02:12:36.188]  Do you understand, young man?
[02:12:36.408 --> 02:12:37.549]  He said, yes ma'am, I'm sorry.
[02:12:37.569 --> 02:12:38.210]  He starts crying.
[02:12:38.570 --> 02:12:40.011]  And she goes, sign here.
[02:12:41.192 --> 02:12:44.635]  Now see, if you're being convicted of something in a real court, it isn't sign here.
[02:12:45.216 --> 02:12:46.797]  They don't under- it's like a third world country.
[02:12:47.330 --> 02:12:48.711]  That's a contract fraud.
[02:12:49.352 --> 02:12:52.034]  You are signing your child over to probation.
[02:12:52.314 --> 02:12:53.976]  They know you don't know procedure.
[02:12:54.176 --> 02:12:55.818]  They know you don't know due process.
[02:12:56.218 --> 02:13:07.408]  So for something that didn't violate any law, that all they could have was administrative discipline in the school, they are now, and then the next time he misses or is late,
[02:13:08.317 --> 02:13:09.137]  You know what's going to happen.
[02:13:09.577 --> 02:13:10.718]  Now he goes to juvenile.
[02:13:10.978 --> 02:13:14.279]  Now he's hanging out with coke heads and drug heads and thieves.
[02:13:14.779 --> 02:13:17.800]  Now he's going to end up running with those guys nine times out of ten.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.141]  He's going to rob houses.
[02:13:19.461 --> 02:13:20.341]  His life's over.
[02:13:21.101 --> 02:13:21.582]  It's over.
[02:13:22.422 --> 02:13:23.462]  And that's what they want.
[02:13:23.782 --> 02:13:26.783]  The drug cartels own the prisons, own the private prisons.
[02:13:27.124 --> 02:13:29.724]  They administer the public prisons, the government prisons.
[02:13:30.185 --> 02:13:33.146]  And literally, they want to pack them for your kids.
[02:13:33.526 --> 02:13:35.386]  They run the narcotics, they run it all.
[02:13:35.746 --> 02:13:37.007]  Now let's just be clear about this.
[02:13:37.791 --> 02:13:38.211]  Okay?
[02:13:38.452 --> 02:13:39.132]  I'm sick of it!
[02:13:39.693 --> 02:13:56.767]  Now, we went down there, lawsuits were filed, uh, we showed they were violating the law, they sent the Travis County SWAT team in, I'm sitting there in the chair, they sit down, start threatening me, this was all over Austin News, I mean, they just, like, like, like, that was gonna get to me.
[02:13:57.067 --> 02:13:58.688]  I've gone past the point of no return.
[02:13:58.868 --> 02:14:04.533]  I'm sure one day you're gonna have me in a pit, ripping my teeth out with pliers, but it doesn't matter, you're still gonna go to hell, you demon!
[02:14:05.293 --> 02:14:07.475]  There are some people that just don't care what you do!
[02:14:07.635 --> 02:14:09.817]  There are some people who aren't afraid of you anymore!
[02:14:09.937 --> 02:14:11.499]  You're feeding on these little kids!
[02:14:13.901 --> 02:14:14.242]  Hold on.
[02:14:15.403 --> 02:14:15.903]  Hold on a minute.
[02:14:19.486 --> 02:14:27.174]  Now, I've seen articles where if you don't finish your homework, they criminally charge your parents.
[02:14:27.734 --> 02:14:29.416]  That's not real law in Houston, Texas.
[02:14:30.245 --> 02:14:31.106]  They can't do this.
[02:14:31.146 --> 02:14:33.467]  They trick you into signing documents when you're there.
[02:14:33.727 --> 02:14:38.090]  It's like they trick you and tell you it's the law, you gotta show up to a courthouse to be injected when there's no law.
[02:14:38.331 --> 02:14:39.651]  The government's criminal!
[02:14:40.012 --> 02:14:40.592]  Period!
[02:14:42.433 --> 02:14:43.074]  Period!
[02:14:46.136 --> 02:14:56.082]  And so, I don't know about Abilene, where you talk in class, and the teacher gives you a ticket, and then you show up, and they say there may be a fine, you notice, because it's not real procedure.
[02:14:56.142 --> 02:14:56.763]  It's not law.
[02:14:57.950 --> 02:15:03.792]  You get there, and they're going to trick them and say, alright, sign here and you're on probation for talking in class.
[02:15:04.213 --> 02:15:05.573]  And now they got you.
[02:15:06.173 --> 02:15:08.174]  The fees, the fines, all of it.
[02:15:09.255 --> 02:15:15.077]  I'm telling you kids, if your parents are dumb enough to put you in a government training camp, or they're so poor they can't help it, keep your mouth shut.
[02:15:15.157 --> 02:15:16.458]  Realize you're in a camp.
[02:15:16.798 --> 02:15:18.218]  Realize enemies run it.
[02:15:18.258 --> 02:15:19.519]  They're there to hurt you.
[02:15:20.099 --> 02:15:21.680]  You keep your mouth shut.
[02:15:23.059 --> 02:15:27.069]  Kids want to come beat you up, you just run, because now they charge both people.
[02:15:27.089 --> 02:15:28.814]  You're being assaulted, you'll be charged too.
[02:15:29.315 --> 02:15:30.378]  Can't even defend yourself.
[02:15:30.965 --> 02:15:32.045]  Keep your mouth shut.
[02:15:32.185 --> 02:15:33.066]  Never get in trouble.
[02:15:33.106 --> 02:15:35.326]  Don't play their sports, because they'll try to set you up there.
[02:15:35.747 --> 02:15:37.467]  Don't hang out with people at the school.
[02:15:37.807 --> 02:15:43.029]  If you're forced to go to one of these death camps, and that's what they are, you just sit there and you keep your mouth shut.
[02:15:43.209 --> 02:15:44.129]  But act a little normal.
[02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:46.990]  They're claiming you've got a psychological problem, and try to do something to you there.
[02:15:47.010 --> 02:15:47.750]  Just act friendly.
[02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:49.071]  Keep your mouth shut.
[02:15:49.331 --> 02:15:51.251]  Realize they're brainwashed zombies running it.
[02:15:51.331 --> 02:15:52.532]  Total idiot scum.
[02:15:52.732 --> 02:15:54.072]  Have no idea what they're part of.
[02:15:54.452 --> 02:15:56.273]  School nurses pushing drugs on the kids.
[02:15:56.733 --> 02:15:58.514]  You just stay out of it, and you beat them.
[02:15:58.534 --> 02:16:05.979]  You beat them real good, and you eat organic food, and you drink good water, and you go for nice jogs, but make sure you jog only at a track.
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:07.841]  Cops will arrest you for jogging down the street.
[02:16:07.861 --> 02:16:09.902]  It's happened to me, or they've tried to.
[02:16:10.403 --> 02:16:12.444]  So just realize, it's a cesspit of evil.
[02:16:12.704 --> 02:16:15.906]  They know young people aren't informed, so they target you.
[02:16:16.226 --> 02:16:18.508]  Once you're a little bit older, they don't target you as much.
[02:16:19.229 --> 02:16:20.489]  You are under attack.
[02:16:20.529 --> 02:16:22.090]  You are literally being hunted.
[02:16:22.771 --> 02:16:23.151]  Okay?
[02:16:23.692 --> 02:16:24.152]  Beat them!
[02:16:24.918 --> 02:16:25.619]  Dress nice.
[02:16:25.779 --> 02:16:26.439]  Be healthy.
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:29.001]  Never use their illegal or legal drugs.
[02:16:30.342 --> 02:16:34.705]  Go get a job while your other friends are sucking their thumbs and playing video games.
[02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:35.806]  Make money.
[02:16:36.066 --> 02:16:37.247]  Take care of your grandma.
[02:16:37.487 --> 02:16:39.409]  I bet your parents aren't taking care of grandma.
[02:16:40.089 --> 02:16:41.650]  She's probably in a city near you.
[02:16:41.890 --> 02:16:43.151]  You ever gone and seen your grandma?
[02:16:43.352 --> 02:16:44.913]  She's probably got bed sores right now.
[02:16:44.953 --> 02:16:47.615]  She's probably being beaten by the people that run the facility.
[02:16:48.355 --> 02:16:52.178]  You need to get enough money to get yourself a car and you need to go take care of your grandmother.
[02:16:53.092 --> 02:16:56.436]  And you need to give her love and hold your grandmother or your grandfather's hand.
[02:16:56.936 --> 02:17:01.581]  And your parents tell you shut up when they got bed sores and the room stinks of urine.
[02:17:02.121 --> 02:17:06.386]  You calmly take photos of it and say, please take care of mama, please take care of grandpa.
[02:17:07.247 --> 02:17:11.111]  That's what you do in this evil, demon-run hell pit!
[02:17:11.651 --> 02:17:13.052]  It's only gonna get worse and worse.
[02:17:13.093 --> 02:17:16.196]  I'm telling you, you wanna hurt them, you just beat them by living well.
[02:17:17.020 --> 02:17:18.701]  You just beat em, beat em, beat em.
[02:17:18.741 --> 02:17:19.881]  Don't use their drugs.
[02:17:20.141 --> 02:17:24.483]  Don't talk in their filthy, disgusting, cesspit scumbag camps.
[02:17:25.243 --> 02:17:25.743]  Beat em!
[02:17:26.483 --> 02:17:26.944]  Beat em!
[02:17:27.304 --> 02:17:28.324]  That's how you beat em.
[02:17:29.124 --> 02:17:30.445]  I want you to live well.
[02:17:31.025 --> 02:17:32.045]  I want you to prosper.
[02:17:32.065 --> 02:17:33.046]  I want you to be happy.
[02:17:33.746 --> 02:17:35.907]  I promise we're going right to your calls when we get back.

[02:17:46.371 --> 02:17:47.772]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:47.792 --> 02:17:49.893]  A new world order.
[02:17:50.594 --> 02:17:54.837]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of governments.
[02:17:55.497 --> 02:17:57.259]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:17:57.459 --> 02:18:00.601]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.121 --> 02:18:03.503]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.290 --> 02:18:11.795]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.637 --> 02:18:19.581]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:18:26.505 --> 02:18:27.665]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.685 --> 02:18:28.446]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.466 --> 02:18:29.526]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.747 --> 02:18:30.387]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.407 --> 02:18:31.428]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:19:50.033 --> 02:19:52.034]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:19:52.194 --> 02:19:53.935]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:19:54.095 --> 02:19:55.335]  The Late Great USA.
[02:19:55.575 --> 02:19:56.995]  America, Freedom the Fascism.

[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:42.861]  I think so.
[02:21:03.484 --> 02:21:07.045]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:21:07.345 --> 02:21:13.346]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:21:13.586 --> 02:21:17.107]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:21:17.367 --> 02:21:21.908]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:21:22.188 --> 02:21:22.968]  Do your part.
[02:21:23.228 --> 02:21:25.489]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[02:21:32.290 --> 02:21:32.530]  I think.
[02:21:50.549 --> 02:21:54.112]  You got agencies that predatory feed on you.
[02:21:54.132 --> 02:21:55.913]  They can care less about you.
[02:21:55.953 --> 02:21:57.734]  They want to hurt you.
[02:21:57.774 --> 02:22:00.556]  The idiots enforcing it don't know that.
[02:22:00.596 --> 02:22:02.277]  You've now been warned.
[02:22:20.188 --> 02:22:23.068]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[02:22:23.769 --> 02:22:26.389]  Hillary and Obama are in town right now, where I'm broadcasting from.
[02:22:26.729 --> 02:22:28.050]  The tell's on that coming up.
[02:22:28.430 --> 02:22:31.171]  Rachel in California, you're on the air.
[02:22:31.211 --> 02:22:31.571]  Welcome.
[02:22:32.691 --> 02:22:33.331]  Alex?
[02:22:34.051 --> 02:22:34.671]  Yes, welcome.
[02:22:35.172 --> 02:22:36.232]  Hi.
[02:22:36.952 --> 02:22:43.854]  Actually, I just want to say I did disagree with one thing that you said a few times a while back, and that was the
[02:22:45.303 --> 02:22:49.145]  Uh, if Hillary gets the nomination, that Obama would be her running mate.
[02:22:49.945 --> 02:23:01.470]  And I just don't think that that's going to happen, because I think that a female and a black vice president is way too much for the New World Order to handle.
[02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:03.510]  Oh, they don't care about fronts.
[02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:05.011]  They don't care about political correctness.
[02:23:05.051 --> 02:23:06.932]  That's just meant to manipulate us.
[02:23:07.552 --> 02:23:10.513]  Yeah, I just, I don't know.
[02:23:12.114 --> 02:23:14.595]  How much I see them trying to kill off, um,
[02:23:15.387 --> 02:23:22.573]  You know, all these black people in Africa with the eugenicists and stuff.
[02:23:22.953 --> 02:23:23.333]  I don't know.
[02:23:23.713 --> 02:23:25.675]  I don't see him getting the nomination.
[02:23:25.695 --> 02:23:28.597]  The black leaders in Africa take that UN money and let them do it.
[02:23:30.198 --> 02:23:30.579]  Yeah.
[02:23:30.799 --> 02:23:31.459]  See?
[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:35.002]  You don't think they can't find black people to go along with their operation?
[02:23:36.132 --> 02:23:41.597]  No, I just don't think that having both of them... It would either be Hillary or Obama.
[02:23:41.617 --> 02:23:43.539]  I don't think... I think both... Well, who knows?
[02:23:43.559 --> 02:23:44.220]  You might be right.
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:46.802]  Newt Gingrich thinks they're going to be, you know, running mates.
[02:23:46.822 --> 02:23:47.282]  He said that.
[02:23:47.322 --> 02:23:48.203]  He's kind of an insider.
[02:23:48.223 --> 02:23:49.044]  But things change.
[02:23:49.084 --> 02:23:49.845]  Things get fluid.
[02:23:50.465 --> 02:23:53.488]  One thing's for sure we're going to find out, and another thing's for sure it doesn't really matter.
[02:23:53.508 --> 02:23:56.471]  I mean, I've been talking about it, but they're all puppets anyway, so, you know.
[02:23:56.791 --> 02:23:58.332]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:23:58.433 --> 02:23:59.454]  I just have one question.
[02:24:00.419 --> 02:24:04.040]  How do I hear your broadcast on the one you had on 9-11, 2001?
[02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:07.762]  I've been looking for that.
[02:24:07.962 --> 02:24:08.982]  That is out on the web.
[02:24:09.042 --> 02:24:11.043]  It's Alex Jones live broadcast from 9-11.
[02:24:11.063 --> 02:24:11.983]  You should Google that.
[02:24:12.304 --> 02:24:13.124]  I've seen it here and there.
[02:24:13.144 --> 02:24:14.244]  I've got a recording of it somewhere.
[02:24:15.125 --> 02:24:15.465]  Okay.
[02:24:17.586 --> 02:24:19.786]  Huh.
[02:24:20.347 --> 02:24:26.509]  It's also weird that you were talking about the truancy thing, because I went through hell with that.
[02:24:28.997 --> 02:24:31.758]  Tell us what happened.
[02:24:33.279 --> 02:24:38.841]  My daughter's teacher, he was like a total control freak.
[02:24:39.161 --> 02:24:39.881]  Oh, I forgot.
[02:24:40.681 --> 02:24:42.862]  The government says that they're their children.
[02:24:43.762 --> 02:24:49.644]  With the ASAP program, if you had the flu and your child had the flu or whatever, in the case of Mike Hanson, the camera guy, that happened to him,
[02:24:50.723 --> 02:24:57.406]  Within two hours of his kid not showing up at school, he hadn't called, so the cops showed up banging on their door there, threatening to arrest him.
[02:24:57.667 --> 02:24:58.807]  I mean, that's how they operate.
[02:24:58.827 --> 02:25:00.368]  It's just a nanny state, always.
[02:25:00.588 --> 02:25:01.769]  But, I mean, tell me about your teacher.
[02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:18.477]  Okay, um, well, he, um, well, okay, one day we get this knock at the, at the, um, door, and, um, I just had my, uh, my second daughter, and I was laying down with her, and my husband answers the door, and it's this police officer.
[02:25:19.469 --> 02:25:34.993]  And he asked for me, but I was laying down with the baby, so he goes, well, she's laying down right now, and I'm here in Susan Hicks' room, so I'm wondering what's going on, so I kind of get up and I'm listening, and there's this sheriff, and he goes, well, what's this all about?
[02:25:35.773 --> 02:25:41.595]  And he doesn't say it's because your kid's missing school or whatever, he says, he goes,
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.645]  If I tell you somebody's got a Type A personality, that means they're a very controlling personality, okay?
[02:25:47.586 --> 02:25:50.369]  Your daughter's teacher is trying to get you guys put into jail.
[02:25:52.031 --> 02:25:55.875]  He is basically, he has any notes that she sends home or whatever, just
[02:25:56.471 --> 02:26:00.133]  Sign him, bring him back, you know, basically kiss her butt.
[02:26:00.354 --> 02:26:01.975]  Now that was a nice cop.
[02:26:02.355 --> 02:26:04.016]  You see, he knows it's a bunch of baloney.
[02:26:04.056 --> 02:26:09.419]  That's the only thing holding back this thing is a lot of the cops are still, you know, got their heads screwed on halfway straight.
[02:26:09.459 --> 02:26:11.241]  But no, that's exactly what goes on.
[02:26:11.261 --> 02:26:12.661]  There's no laws, no nothing.
[02:26:12.982 --> 02:26:14.363]  They just harass everybody.
[02:26:14.743 --> 02:26:14.983]  Yeah.
[02:26:15.543 --> 02:26:15.804]  Yeah.
[02:26:16.004 --> 02:26:24.169]  And I mean, um, she was like, um, see, uh, when I would, when I would walk her to school, I kind of walk her there early and just drop her off.
[02:26:24.764 --> 02:26:29.146]  And I didn't know, I'm only 15 years older than my daughter, so I'm not that much older than my kid.
[02:26:29.866 --> 02:26:34.788]  And when I went to school, you know, I'd get there early and we'd play, you know, it'd be like recess or whatever.
[02:26:34.808 --> 02:26:42.791]  No, my dad sometimes would take me instead of, or my mom, instead of me taking the bus, and I might get there an hour early, and that meant I got to go eat a second breakfast in the lunch hole.
[02:26:43.151 --> 02:26:44.552]  Yeah, but you got to play around and stuff.
[02:26:44.912 --> 02:26:52.695]  So, you know, I'd drop her off early thinking that, you know, but then she would complain, and when my husband would walk her, he would stay with her.
[02:26:53.328 --> 02:27:02.791]  And, you know, she's like daddy's little girl, so I didn't really think anything of it, but I found out that they weren't allowed to run around or play.
[02:27:03.131 --> 02:27:05.832]  When you get there early, they'd basically just be walking and playing.
[02:27:05.852 --> 02:27:11.894]  Most schools, first they banned dodgeball, now they've banned tag or running, and now they're little prisoners.
[02:27:11.914 --> 02:27:14.554]  They have to sit there, take their Prozac, and they're not allowed to run.
[02:27:14.574 --> 02:27:16.395]  If you don't believe me, folks, Google it.
[02:27:17.015 --> 02:27:19.377]  Again, it's about psychological torture.
[02:27:19.717 --> 02:27:23.761]  Then they come in, don't let them go to the bathroom all day, make them go in trash cans with cots there.
[02:27:24.561 --> 02:27:25.963]  It's a re-education camp.
[02:27:26.243 --> 02:27:30.326]  It's about breaking your children down, traumatizing them, brainwashing them.
[02:27:30.506 --> 02:27:31.187]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.671 --> 02:27:37.592]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.052 --> 02:27:39.674]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.574 --> 02:27:43.317]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.326 --> 02:27:46.987]  It's a fact.
[02:27:47.207 --> 02:27:54.673]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:27:54.813 --> 02:28:03.680]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:14.488]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:28:14.728 --> 02:28:15.208]  We're good to go.

[02:29:46.286 --> 02:29:50.327]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:50.547 --> 02:29:53.948]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:54.108 --> 02:29:57.629]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.869 --> 02:30:01.109]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:01.129 --> 02:30:06.611]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:06.631 --> 02:30:11.852]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:12.312 --> 02:30:16.255]  Well, going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:30:16.395 --> 02:30:17.676]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:30:17.716 --> 02:30:23.640]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:28.123]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:28.203 --> 02:30:29.564]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[02:30:41.719 --> 02:30:48.002]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:30:48.322 --> 02:30:56.766]  Alright, I'm gonna blast through your calls, but I know people driving along in their cars.
[02:30:56.846 --> 02:30:57.966]  New listeners didn't believe me.
[02:30:58.447 --> 02:31:00.628]  I typed, children not allowed to run in playground.
[02:31:02.208 --> 02:31:05.490]  And I got all these mainstream news stories.
[02:31:05.890 --> 02:31:07.311]  Playground games banned.
[02:31:10.184 --> 02:31:25.391]  CBC not allowed to, it goes on, it's just over and over again, it says not allowed to run outside, not allowed to skip rope, schools have banned skipping rope, hula hoops, but they have not banned the deep fried snacks.
[02:31:26.572 --> 02:31:28.913]  And in some cases even running in the playground is not allowed.
[02:31:29.620 --> 02:31:30.901]  Just like in a prison yard.
[02:31:30.941 --> 02:31:32.241]  You're not allowed to run around.
[02:31:32.741 --> 02:31:33.622]  These are prisons!
[02:31:34.262 --> 02:31:36.283]  Most... See, they started 15 years ago.
[02:31:36.923 --> 02:31:39.964]  Dodgeball is banned, reportedly, nationwide.
[02:31:41.965 --> 02:31:43.746]  But, by the way, you think I'm joking.
[02:31:43.806 --> 02:31:53.690]  From Minnesota, to Michigan, to Texas, we have literally hundreds of news articles where they unannounced, cops run in with guns, they say, we're terrorists, we're homeschoolers, we're here to kill you.
[02:31:53.770 --> 02:31:57.712]  And the schools say, well, the feds paid us to do this, we have to follow this curriculum.
[02:31:58.303 --> 02:32:00.792]  And the children wet themselves, defecate all over themselves.
[02:32:01.334 --> 02:32:03.161]  In other cases they'll have middle school...
[02:32:04.887 --> 02:32:14.113]  after school deals or they'll have camp and the cops come with knives and masks and we're going to kill you and they literally have panic attacks and have to go into mental institutions.
[02:32:14.513 --> 02:32:15.934]  Oh, that was in the news about a month ago.
[02:32:16.574 --> 02:32:31.583]  A famous case in Michigan, all over the state, they had control burns in the parking lot, marched the kids out, set fires, and had 50 plus cops run around screaming in masks, I'm homeschoolers against public school, we're going to kill you.
[02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:37.092]  And that was the federal curriculum, and the children thought they were going to die, and they threw fake blood on them.
[02:32:37.712 --> 02:32:40.574]  Again, that's to demonize homeschool, demonize guns.
[02:32:40.614 --> 02:32:42.195]  Those kids will be screwed up for life, a lot of them.
[02:32:42.836 --> 02:32:43.196]  It's over!
[02:32:44.821 --> 02:32:47.703]  Uh, we've had teachers on where it was unannounced until the teachers were going to kill them.
[02:32:48.063 --> 02:32:49.884]  The teacher ends up in a mental institution.
[02:32:50.605 --> 02:32:52.126]  I mean, you know, it's just over, folks.
[02:32:52.546 --> 02:32:54.647]  Hardcore Soviet mind control.
[02:32:54.887 --> 02:32:59.010]  The cops are so dumb, you know, the feds give them the training and give them money to go do it.
[02:32:59.050 --> 02:33:03.032]  Sometimes 50, 40, 100 grand, depending on how many, I mean, it's just masses of money.
[02:33:03.293 --> 02:33:04.353]  You can go look it up for yourself.
[02:33:04.913 --> 02:33:07.155]  I've seen it be over 100 grand to do a series of these.
[02:33:08.185 --> 02:33:10.708]  Uh, and it's just hellish mind control.
[02:33:11.108 --> 02:33:16.773]  And all over the country, they make the kids wait all day, no lunch, to show them what a real terror attack's like.
[02:33:17.574 --> 02:33:23.359]  That then depresses them, and then after two hours after lunch, when they're really got low blood sugar, they're really freaked out and crying.
[02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:26.122]  They're made to defecate and urinate in trash cans.
[02:33:26.242 --> 02:33:27.243]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[02:33:28.749 --> 02:33:31.550]  Now, the Soviets would do it when they came into an Eastern European country.
[02:33:31.570 --> 02:33:32.110]  They were taking over.
[02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:35.951]  They put up sports stadiums, you know, movie screens, blaring propaganda.
[02:33:36.311 --> 02:33:38.331]  They wouldn't beat you if you'd tattle on your friends.
[02:33:38.371 --> 02:33:43.232]  It was, you know, freaking you out, terrorizing you, threatening to kill you, to break you down.
[02:33:44.372 --> 02:33:44.892]  And this is it.
[02:33:44.912 --> 02:33:45.713]  Just red dawn.
[02:33:45.733 --> 02:33:49.153]  Might as well have a sports stadium and lights flashing and just, you know.
[02:33:49.734 --> 02:33:52.274]  Folks, we're so far into hell pit right now.
[02:33:52.854 --> 02:33:54.074]  But again, the parents don't know.
[02:33:54.134 --> 02:33:55.475]  It's all going on at the school.
[02:33:55.835 --> 02:33:56.635]  It's all happening.
[02:34:00.151 --> 02:34:01.992]  Because I know I say this stuff and it sounds like it's made up.
[02:34:02.212 --> 02:34:03.312]  It's all right here in front of me.
[02:34:05.093 --> 02:34:06.493]  The magnitude of it.
[02:34:07.933 --> 02:34:10.214]  Because they know that these are defenseless children.
[02:34:11.354 --> 02:34:12.855]  And it's just so sick.
[02:34:12.915 --> 02:34:18.136]  And they know they're going to be totally traumatized, trained to get on the FEMA buses, trained to do all this.
[02:34:18.357 --> 02:34:19.737]  They're training them how to be prisoners.
[02:34:20.677 --> 02:34:23.038]  And then they'll also hate homeschoolers and gun owners forever.
[02:34:23.918 --> 02:34:25.779]  Okay, David in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:34:25.799 --> 02:34:29.320]  I don't know what to say after all that.
[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:34.022]  We've got a situation coming up in a few months with a national ID card.
[02:34:35.463 --> 02:34:36.963]  I just wanted to get your take on that.
[02:34:37.023 --> 02:34:41.025]  Is that going to... I mean, obviously, if we all refuse it, we're all in prison.
[02:34:41.065 --> 02:34:42.566]  We're not going to be able to do any good.
[02:34:42.966 --> 02:34:45.388]  Well, it's a complex disinfo operation.
[02:34:45.428 --> 02:34:49.430]  We've had a national ID card since the mid-1990s.
[02:34:49.470 --> 02:34:57.334]  We've had a world ID card since it was standardized through International Convention and Compact in 2000 in Australia at a UN summit.
[02:34:57.634 --> 02:34:59.495]  It's already a global system.
[02:35:00.236 --> 02:35:11.652]  And now they're just going to enforce it with no job, no car, no loans, no getting on planes, buses, trains, without your federally standardized ID cards of the states.
[02:35:12.310 --> 02:35:19.136]  Well, is that something that... I know Aaron Russo said he wasn't going to accept his, and I'm looking at it... But see, what people don't know is you already have it.
[02:35:19.557 --> 02:35:20.878]  See, they're very slick, sir.
[02:35:20.918 --> 02:35:22.980]  They're just now announcing the NSA spies on you.
[02:35:23.421 --> 02:35:25.923]  Let me... Well, like you say, what can you do then?
[02:35:26.323 --> 02:35:27.644]  Then I won't worry about that anymore.
[02:35:27.745 --> 02:35:29.386]  One thing I want to run past you real quick.
[02:35:29.406 --> 02:35:31.088]  I just got your Police State DVD.
[02:35:32.362 --> 02:35:36.123]  Um, because I wanted to help support you and I had everything else, but I wanted to run something past you.
[02:35:36.143 --> 02:35:37.023]  I'll make it really quick.
[02:35:37.083 --> 02:35:42.125]  I lived north of San Antonio in 99, just north of 281.
[02:35:42.805 --> 02:35:49.146]  And I remember one day, and my friend will vouch for me on this, a helicopter was going up and down the Rosa homes and he was flying in like a chain pattern.
[02:35:49.166 --> 02:35:52.207]  He was flying to a house, doing a circle, flying to the next house, doing a circle.
[02:35:53.007 --> 02:35:53.927]  I want to let you know about this.
[02:35:54.348 --> 02:35:59.669]  I watched this for about an hour and a half as he came down the Rosa houses coming from north to south.
[02:36:00.330 --> 02:36:03.831]  And I don't know if this has anything to do with that training that was on your video or not.
[02:36:03.871 --> 02:36:05.032]  Yeah, it's infrared.
[02:36:05.052 --> 02:36:06.993]  They're scanning each home for grow lights.
[02:36:07.953 --> 02:36:10.374]  Okay, because I wanted to say that.
[02:36:10.614 --> 02:36:14.075]  But then the next time it'll be the machine gun you as you flee down the street.
[02:36:14.536 --> 02:36:17.377]  Well, and I was curious, because see, I've never grown dope in my life.
[02:36:17.477 --> 02:36:18.077]  I was curious.
[02:36:18.117 --> 02:36:19.758]  That's the thing I wanted to bring up with you.
[02:36:19.798 --> 02:36:22.439]  He stopped over my house and I found that curious.
[02:36:22.899 --> 02:36:28.241]  And without having the keen sense to grab a video recorder, I grabbed my phone and I called my best friend.
[02:36:28.801 --> 02:36:32.646]  And I'd already called him and told him about the situation, this helicopter flying over the houses.
[02:36:33.147 --> 02:36:34.509]  I went out onto my balcony.
[02:36:34.889 --> 02:36:39.395]  This helicopter was low enough to where I could see the pilots in the window.
[02:36:42.262 --> 02:36:44.624]  I held the phone up so Joe could hear the helicopter.
[02:36:44.644 --> 02:36:46.026]  They must have thought I had a pistol.
[02:36:46.466 --> 02:36:48.748]  He jerked, I know this sounds ridiculous, but it happened.
[02:36:49.028 --> 02:36:52.972]  He jerked the helicopter back and that's the only thing I can think of is he thought I was going to fire at him.
[02:36:53.432 --> 02:37:01.159]  But A, I wasn't growing dope, and B, on the right hand side of that helicopter there was a device that was about four feet around.
[02:37:01.259 --> 02:37:01.720]  A pod.
[02:37:02.293 --> 02:37:02.453]  What?
[02:37:02.593 --> 02:37:04.134]  Okay, I don't know anything about that.
[02:37:04.154 --> 02:37:05.594]  Was it a black or white dome?
[02:37:05.994 --> 02:37:07.035]  It was, it was dark.
[02:37:07.075 --> 02:37:08.455]  It was the same color as the helicopter.
[02:37:08.575 --> 02:37:11.996]  Yeah, they were doing an infrared or a radio wave scan.
[02:37:12.357 --> 02:37:24.021]  They've got them where they can, and they don't tell the public this, but it's now been declassified, where they can see you having sex on the toilet, but generally the police are flying around and the military are flying around with one that just picks up big heat resonance signals.
[02:37:24.261 --> 02:37:24.961]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:25.101 --> 02:37:26.161]  It's all part of your freedom.
[02:37:27.042 --> 02:37:30.443]  But your car gets stolen, your house gets broken into, they're not coming out to your house.
[02:37:31.089 --> 02:37:35.873]  But if they got a way to suck your child into their system, they'll do it with absolute pleasure.
[02:37:37.054 --> 02:37:37.895]  Makes me sick.
[02:37:38.576 --> 02:37:40.297]  Stacey in Idaho, you're on the air.
[02:37:42.559 --> 02:37:53.849]  I just had a question about, I've been listening to the economy going down and all that, and what do you think, should we leave cash in the bank, hide it in our house, and what about food supply, do we hide it?
[02:37:53.869 --> 02:37:54.770]  I mean, what?
[02:37:55.928 --> 02:38:05.572]  You know, if they go to martial law or a total financial collapse or a bioweapons release, and our friends could do any of those or none of the above, but it's all certainly in the cards.
[02:38:05.592 --> 02:38:06.493]  You've got to prepare for it.
[02:38:07.373 --> 02:38:11.355]  At first, when they lock stuff down, I don't think the next big event will be total lockdown.
[02:38:11.475 --> 02:38:15.457]  Each one gets bigger as they train us how to behave, how to act like slaves.
[02:38:16.289 --> 02:38:22.470]  You know, they want to be very careful about the enslavement, also making sure all their minions follow orders, testing.
[02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:31.692]  So there'll probably be a big building that's blown up, or a smaller bio-release, only a few thousand die, and then we have to have checkpoints, and life will be different after that, and then a bigger event comes after that.
[02:38:32.453 --> 02:38:43.455]  But if it's a financial collapse, you know, it'll just be, come down here to the sports stadium to get your food, and then, oh, by the way, give us your guns, because there's been some riots, and then that's what'll happen.
[02:38:44.224 --> 02:38:56.885]  But yeah, no, I mean, if it's in the region where the attack happens, you will have troops come to your house and they'll drag you out and slam your head in the concrete and break your nose and laugh about it, and they'll all sit there and admire your guns and steal them for themselves, just like New Orleans.
[02:38:57.577 --> 02:39:01.278]  When do you think this is going to happen in the next year, two years, three years?
[02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:01.758]  I don't know.
[02:39:01.778 --> 02:39:04.219]  I just know that they spend all their time preparing.
[02:39:04.399 --> 02:39:06.700]  The entire government operation is nothing but this.
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:07.841]  This is all they do.
[02:39:07.901 --> 02:39:11.482]  Because once they take over, they can have all the pension funds, all your property.
[02:39:11.922 --> 02:39:13.983]  Anybody in a black uniform will be like God.
[02:39:14.003 --> 02:39:19.645]  You know, it'll be the Super Bowl guys in black uniforms with supermodels with them, you know, shining their helmets.
[02:39:19.685 --> 02:39:26.427]  I mean, just total sickness, total evil, gibbering yuppies running around worshiping the evil just so they get to keep their power.
[02:39:26.867 --> 02:39:35.040]  So should we do food supply now in our home and hide it?
[02:39:35.221 --> 02:39:35.862]  Absolutely!
[02:39:35.902 --> 02:39:40.309]  And again, it isn't because we know it's going to happen, it's because it's a possibility and it's the proper preparation.
[02:39:40.774 --> 02:39:41.694]  But what about the cash?
[02:39:41.714 --> 02:39:47.016]  Because I've got some cash I have... Well, they can just devalue that, and they are devaluing that right now.
[02:39:47.417 --> 02:39:49.137]  But I would have a mix of things, you know?
[02:39:49.658 --> 02:39:53.659]  Something in a safety deposit box, something at home, something buried, you know, at the farm.
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:56.940]  You know, really, food is the key.
[02:39:57.701 --> 02:40:03.383]  And if you really want to get into preparedness, if stuff breaks down, the toilets will all overflow from the sewage.
[02:40:04.003 --> 02:40:06.464]  So you've got to know how to seal those toilets.
[02:40:06.964 --> 02:40:12.766]  If you really want to get serious, you want to be able to seal your toilets, have a chemical toilet, and have a year's supply of food for everybody in your house.
[02:40:13.426 --> 02:40:16.167]  But don't put it under the house, maybe up above in the attic?
[02:40:16.207 --> 02:40:17.527]  Yes, yes.
[02:40:17.567 --> 02:40:23.629]  But the biggest problem is, or you have some old food that's out in the open, an old gun, you just give away to them when they come.
[02:40:23.929 --> 02:40:24.930]  Right.
[02:40:25.010 --> 02:40:29.031]  And you also, this happened in New Orleans, if you're a good looking woman, you want to stay out of their way.
[02:40:29.271 --> 02:40:32.932]  Because most of the troops are now illegal aliens or felons, and they're going to want to have their way with you.
[02:40:33.391 --> 02:40:34.711]  We have a total scum military.
[02:40:34.791 --> 02:40:36.952]  Okay, well thank you.
[02:40:37.272 --> 02:40:37.972]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:40:38.872 --> 02:40:41.672]  And by total scum, the directorate people that run it are total scum.
[02:40:41.692 --> 02:40:44.893]  There's still a lot of good people in there, but they're shifting over to a total scum military.
[02:40:45.873 --> 02:40:47.233]  I'm very happy to talk about that.
[02:40:47.273 --> 02:40:48.854]  Isn't it a nice life we have here?
[02:40:49.034 --> 02:40:50.814]  I'm totally mad about all this, folks.
[02:40:51.194 --> 02:40:52.114]  I'm sick of doing this.
[02:40:52.154 --> 02:40:53.434]  I'm sick of having to talk about it.
[02:40:53.894 --> 02:40:55.355]  Most people don't see how clear it is.
[02:40:55.535 --> 02:40:56.615]  I do see what it's like.
[02:40:56.755 --> 02:40:57.115]  I know.
[02:40:57.895 --> 02:40:58.735]  I know what they're doing.
[02:40:59.175 --> 02:41:00.176]  It's disgusting.
[02:41:00.796 --> 02:41:02.516]  And it's ruining all of our futures.
[02:41:03.450 --> 02:41:05.871]  They're going to take your pension funds too, cops.
[02:41:06.251 --> 02:41:09.912]  And they're going to give you fluoride and your water and all that stuff and your shots for your kids.
[02:41:10.152 --> 02:41:11.073]  Well, I'm your friend.
[02:41:12.233 --> 02:41:13.353]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:41:13.394 --> 02:41:14.594]  I know who these people are.
[02:41:15.394 --> 02:41:15.794]  Okay?
[02:41:16.675 --> 02:41:17.075]  I know.
[02:41:17.375 --> 02:41:18.515]  I've been right all along.
[02:41:19.336 --> 02:41:21.636]  Everything I talk about is in major newspapers today.
[02:41:22.077 --> 02:41:22.637]  This is it.
[02:41:23.437 --> 02:41:24.777]  Now, the good news is people are mad.
[02:41:24.798 --> 02:41:25.278]  They're riled.
[02:41:25.318 --> 02:41:26.778]  The globalists are a little hesitant now.
[02:41:27.098 --> 02:41:28.539]  So they're going to go ahead with the incremental move.
[02:41:30.319 --> 02:41:31.700]  Scott in Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:41:32.915 --> 02:41:33.475]  Hello, my friend.
[02:41:33.495 --> 02:41:33.535]  Hi.
[02:41:33.875 --> 02:41:36.397]  It's a pleasure and an honor to speak to you.
[02:41:37.017 --> 02:41:39.158]  I just wanted to ask a question.
[02:41:39.198 --> 02:41:56.746]  I listen to your show about every day, but I have not heard anybody bring up, if the globalists don't get their Christmas wish and Obama does get the nomination, would Hillary be considered as his running mate?
[02:41:59.007 --> 02:41:59.628]  Say that again?
[02:42:00.148 --> 02:42:02.289]  Well, if Obama would get the nomination.
[02:42:03.075 --> 02:42:06.097]  Would Hillary run as his running mate?
[02:42:06.157 --> 02:42:07.178]  I think it's all on the table.
[02:42:07.198 --> 02:42:09.979]  I think the Bloomberg dark horse is a big one.
[02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:13.401]  I think that there's a lot of different issues there.
[02:42:14.122 --> 02:42:17.184]  And all the candidates are weak, so it's strong for a third-party run.
[02:42:18.144 --> 02:42:24.168]  But it doesn't matter if it's Hillary or Obama or Obama and Hillary or McCain and whoever, because it's all staged.
[02:42:24.689 --> 02:42:26.149]  Well, here's kind of my thought on it.
[02:42:28.005 --> 02:42:35.089]  I would definitely not want her as a running mate because of the hubris of the Clintons wanting to be President.
[02:42:35.909 --> 02:42:37.670]  Something would definitely happen to Obama.
[02:42:37.690 --> 02:42:41.652]  There's been talk about if he got in any way that there possibly could be an assassination.
[02:42:42.522 --> 02:42:43.622]  Well, it's like Congress.
[02:42:43.682 --> 02:42:47.243]  Congress allows the President to say they're not involved in government anymore.
[02:42:47.263 --> 02:42:50.624]  I mean, that's the real target of these people.
[02:42:51.504 --> 02:43:01.007]  But meanwhile, you've got a bunch of Republicans and another top Republican judge just caught drunk driving in drag, who are part of this weird little nanny guild that the globalists control.
[02:43:01.727 --> 02:43:05.208]  And it's just total decadent scum running everything.
[02:43:05.268 --> 02:43:05.968]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:06.668 --> 02:43:07.329]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:07.709 --> 02:43:09.250]  Well, here's my take on it.
[02:43:09.350 --> 02:43:15.255]  I would not want to be Obama and have Hillary as my vice president because, again, of the hubris of the Clintons.
[02:43:15.355 --> 02:43:17.036]  No, it's like Bush Sr.
[02:43:17.076 --> 02:43:18.738]  and clearly involved in having Reagan shot.
[02:43:19.038 --> 02:43:30.227]  Yeah, and then what would happen is, if he's got a dog, his head would end up being chewed off and then Whammy Fammy would come in and say, oh, the family pooch ate his head.
[02:43:30.867 --> 02:43:31.808]  I appreciate the call.
[02:43:32.801 --> 02:43:34.142]  Let's talk to Richard in Denver.
[02:43:34.202 --> 02:43:35.082]  Richard, you're on the air.
[02:43:36.043 --> 02:43:37.544]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:43:37.584 --> 02:43:41.125]  Remember, you're motivated by your love of your fellow citizens.
[02:43:42.046 --> 02:43:44.067]  Don't get sucked into their hatin' game.
[02:43:44.087 --> 02:43:46.228]  I know, I'm being a bit hateful today.
[02:43:46.248 --> 02:43:47.829]  I'm just so sick of it, man.
[02:43:48.109 --> 02:43:49.670]  It's so obvious what they're doing.
[02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:53.151]  Well, I know, but part of their plan is to get you hating.
[02:43:53.732 --> 02:44:01.456]  And when you're hating, let's just imagine that there's like an energy field around the planet that's determined by the amount of love and the
[02:44:02.532 --> 02:44:07.435]  And the lack of love that is involved in the planet at the moment.
[02:44:07.595 --> 02:44:14.439]  Your love is very powerful and very important and you must find your center and be in that love as much as you can.
[02:44:14.679 --> 02:44:23.064]  All of us must work from that place because in love there is no resistance, but in the resistance there must be love.
[02:44:23.564 --> 02:44:28.227]  And the reason I'm calling is I've been reading John Taylor Gatto's book
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.823]  I guess that you had on about this school system.
[02:44:32.183 --> 02:44:35.746]  You're absolutely right about what's going on in our school system.
[02:44:36.207 --> 02:44:42.533]  The police state is closing in on every corner, and I wanted to tell you about an incident that happened to me last week.
[02:44:43.213 --> 02:44:50.360]  I was called for jury duty here in Denver, and during the course of waiting to be called up for a case,
[02:44:51.167 --> 02:45:06.478]  I had been reading about fully informed jury associations literature about jury nullification, and the more I read, the more I realized that this is the place where the people still
[02:45:07.535 --> 02:45:09.196]  They exercise their power.
[02:45:09.316 --> 02:45:09.936]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[02:45:09.976 --> 02:45:19.842]  The founders, the common law back in Magna Carta 1215, the government can pass corrupt laws, try to persecute innocent people, like Kelly Rushing in Kentucky, no criminal record.
[02:45:19.862 --> 02:45:23.904]  They have a cop, a Ron Paul video, and they arrested him and said, this is anti-government.
[02:45:24.265 --> 02:45:28.007]  And they said, this terrorized us, this video of Ron Paul speaking.
[02:45:28.047 --> 02:45:29.407]  I'm not kidding, this is in the newspaper.
[02:45:29.788 --> 02:45:35.551]  And they took him to court, wanted two charges of terroristic threat via the video, and the jury found him not guilty.
[02:45:36.314 --> 02:45:47.179]  Well, William Penn was charged with preaching an illegal religion in London, that religion being Quakerism, and the jury found him innocent in spite of the law.
[02:45:48.039 --> 02:45:56.083]  Four members of that jury were put into jail and kept in jail for four days and not allowed toilet facilities or food or any kind of
[02:45:58.699 --> 02:46:01.081]  Visits by, you know, representation.
[02:46:01.121 --> 02:46:01.802]  Forget about it.
[02:46:02.122 --> 02:46:07.367]  The judge tried to make the jury renounce their... Yeah, that's how they try to break in.
[02:46:07.627 --> 02:46:10.190]  And they're torturing our kids right now in the schools.
[02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:11.070]  Exactly.
[02:46:11.090 --> 02:46:14.834]  Well, there's an organization, F.I.J.A.
[02:46:15.755 --> 02:46:18.657]  Yeah, the founder is Red Beckman.
[02:46:19.798 --> 02:46:24.743]  And the executive director is a wonderful woman by the name of Elo Elo Jones.
[02:46:25.256 --> 02:46:26.657]  Who is doing fantastic work.
[02:46:26.677 --> 02:46:26.897]  No, no.
[02:46:26.917 --> 02:46:27.877]  We're going to have him back on.
[02:46:27.897 --> 02:46:29.238]  We probably had him on 30 times.
[02:46:29.598 --> 02:46:30.539]  Thanks for the call, bro.
[02:46:30.659 --> 02:46:31.559]  Derek in Michigan.
[02:46:31.579 --> 02:46:32.399]  You're on the air, Derek.
[02:46:32.459 --> 02:46:33.320]  Or Missouri, excuse me.
[02:46:34.100 --> 02:46:34.580]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:35.061]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:35.221 --> 02:46:36.801]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:46:36.822 --> 02:46:49.768]  Hey, I'm a 36-year-old black man, and I was affected by what you were saying about the poisoning in schools, because I dropped out of school, and different things like that.
[02:46:50.428 --> 02:46:54.590]  And I just want to know how can I... I want to go to college and be a school teacher.
[02:46:55.330 --> 02:47:01.095]  And I've been listening to what you've been saying about how they're going up with the tuition and all this stuff.
[02:47:01.655 --> 02:47:03.997]  Is that a good thing to do for right now?
[02:47:04.197 --> 02:47:11.102]  I think it's good to have good teachers and people and good cops, but they don't let you teach or be a good officer or good in the system.
[02:47:11.863 --> 02:47:13.784]  Notice now, police are synonymous with schools.
[02:47:15.005 --> 02:47:18.908]  You have to follow their edicts, which is all compartmentalized.
[02:47:18.928 --> 02:47:23.532]  But if you've got your GED and you're going to college and want to get a teaching certificate, more power to you.
[02:47:24.421 --> 02:47:27.962]  Uh, it's just that, uh, and some schools are better than others.
[02:47:27.982 --> 02:47:30.863]  They're not all, you know, engaged in Soviet brainwashing.
[02:47:30.883 --> 02:47:32.684]  I mean, literally, it's Soviet brainwashing.
[02:47:32.704 --> 02:47:35.285]  Uh, but, uh, I mean, it's hellish.
[02:47:35.925 --> 02:47:40.326]  Okay, and can you get a name of, of, of, of different parts on education?
[02:47:40.346 --> 02:47:42.707]  Because I want to get more into, uh, those books.
[02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:46.482]  Uh, books about, uh, education.
[02:47:46.542 --> 02:47:49.343]  I know John, I know John, uh, Taylor Gatto.
[02:47:49.483 --> 02:47:54.765]  Yeah, that's the underground history of education, and you've got the deliberate dumbing down by Charlotte Isserby.
[02:47:55.045 --> 02:47:55.305]  Okay.
[02:47:55.325 --> 02:48:01.428]  But I mean, if you read the big founding textbooks on teaching, it's about making us standardized, dumbing us down, controlling us.
[02:48:01.768 --> 02:48:06.830]  But by the time you get down to the low level as a teacher, and they're going to tell you this curriculum's good, and it's for good reasons.
[02:48:07.853 --> 02:48:10.234]  Right, and I know better by listening to your program.
[02:48:10.274 --> 02:48:13.835]  Yeah, we go to the engineering books by people that actually wrote it what they said.
[02:48:14.155 --> 02:48:14.516]  Okay.
[02:48:16.016 --> 02:48:18.737]  Okay, and that's what I was trying to find out, the engineer books.
[02:48:19.658 --> 02:48:29.321]  Well, you can go to John Taylor Gatto's website, and he has his 500-page book for free on there, and it's got all the citations, so many it'll make your head spin, or you can buy Deliberate Dumbing Down.
[02:48:29.962 --> 02:48:33.623]  It's the size of a phone book with all the documents in it at InfoWars.com.
[02:48:33.783 --> 02:48:34.663]  Anything else?
[02:48:35.244 --> 02:48:35.604]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:36.519 --> 02:48:37.300]  Thank you very much.
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:38.461]  Thank you, Derek.
[02:48:38.481 --> 02:48:39.121]  Good to hear from you.
[02:48:39.141 --> 02:48:40.843]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:48:40.863 --> 02:48:45.647]  Stay with me.
[02:48:46.607 --> 02:48:48.009]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.029 --> 02:48:50.130]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.851 --> 02:48:55.295]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:55.755 --> 02:48:57.497]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:57.577 --> 02:49:00.839]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:03.782]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.529 --> 02:49:11.859]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.873 --> 02:49:19.856]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.337 --> 02:49:23.799]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.199 --> 02:49:26.701]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.761 --> 02:49:27.922]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.942 --> 02:49:28.702]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.722 --> 02:49:29.763]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.003 --> 02:49:30.764]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.964 --> 02:49:31.964]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:32.125 --> 02:49:40.310]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:40.470 --> 02:49:43.452]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.652 --> 02:49:44.673]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.734 --> 02:49:46.695]  We're good to go.
[02:50:02.392 --> 02:50:16.576]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[02:50:16.856 --> 02:50:24.538]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[02:50:25.059 --> 02:50:27.899]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:29.540]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:30.941]  Decide now.
[02:50:31.421 --> 02:50:32.222]  Place your bet.
[02:50:33.003 --> 02:50:34.464]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[02:50:34.844 --> 02:50:36.246]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:50:36.266 --> 02:50:36.486]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:50:46.042 --> 02:50:47.884]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:50:48.024 --> 02:50:53.208]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:50:53.388 --> 02:50:54.729]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:50:54.989 --> 02:51:03.176]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:03.396 --> 02:51:09.121]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:09.281 --> 02:51:11.063]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:51:11.123 --> 02:51:13.306]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:51:13.326 --> 02:51:17.692]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:51:17.852 --> 02:51:20.035]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:51:20.075 --> 02:51:26.783]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio back.
[02:51:29.275 --> 02:51:29.655]  I think so.
[02:51:48.701 --> 02:51:52.245]  Final segment, I want to jam in a few final calls and hit on one story.
[02:51:52.825 --> 02:51:59.773]  But first, Freedom Law School's 2008 Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference is coming up March 28th through the 31st.
[02:52:00.193 --> 02:52:00.453]  Where?
[02:52:00.574 --> 02:52:01.915]  Irvine, California.
[02:52:04.341 --> 02:52:11.624]  Jason Burmiss, G. Edward Griffin, Tommy Cryer, Joe Bannister, Larry Becraft, Michael Collins Piper, and many, many others.
[02:52:11.644 --> 02:52:16.305]  It's going to be an amazing conference out there, so go ahead and get your tickets now.
[02:52:16.365 --> 02:52:17.706]  They have sold out many times.
[02:52:18.006 --> 02:52:19.066]  They have every three or four months.
[02:52:19.086 --> 02:52:19.547]  760-868-4271.
[02:52:19.567 --> 02:52:20.467]  760-868-4271 or livefreenow.org.
[02:52:29.875 --> 02:52:34.876]  That is LiveFreeNow.org, coming up in Irvine, California, 28th to the 31st.
[02:52:35.557 --> 02:52:40.118]  Also, I'm a documentary filmmaker, online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:40.558 --> 02:52:46.540]  We also want your help getting the free YouTube video condensed of the Monday interview with Willie Nelson.
[02:52:46.940 --> 02:52:48.880]  We want to get that out and have that go viral.
[02:52:48.900 --> 02:52:50.401]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:50.421 --> 02:52:51.861]  Please help us out with that.
[02:52:52.021 --> 02:52:55.662]  Indonesian health minister accuses US of bird flu, bioweapon conspiracy.
[02:52:56.357 --> 02:52:58.139]  New book endorsed by President accuses U.S.
[02:52:58.179 --> 02:53:09.511]  government of seeking monopoly to make vast profits and potentially wage warfare with the bioweapon, of course, as a way to destabilize Asia, which is exactly what scientists in China and other places have looked at it.
[02:53:09.571 --> 02:53:10.272]  It's engineered.
[02:53:11.201 --> 02:53:12.322]  And it's just our friends.
[02:53:12.462 --> 02:53:16.324]  But the good news is people are getting wise to the new world order.
[02:53:16.864 --> 02:53:18.245]  And I'm going to talk more about this tomorrow.
[02:53:18.265 --> 02:53:19.926]  I think I'm going to have Paul on to talk about this.
[02:53:19.946 --> 02:53:20.667]  This is a big issue.
[02:53:20.687 --> 02:53:21.627]  Should have gotten into it more.
[02:53:22.027 --> 02:53:26.410]  But it is up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:53:27.991 --> 02:53:29.011]  Let's go to Dan in Illinois.
[02:53:29.051 --> 02:53:30.592]  I'll try to cram in Matthew and Michael.
[02:53:30.632 --> 02:53:31.793]  Dan in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:53:32.413 --> 02:53:32.873]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:33.874 --> 02:53:35.415]  On the infrared sensing radar,
[02:53:36.429 --> 02:53:53.233]  They've now got a new contract for a VISA building out of San Diego, which would scan the entire building, which is illegal, because when they do it for drugs, they said it was constitutional because they're scanning the excess heat radiating off your house.
[02:53:53.333 --> 02:53:53.593]  Yes.
[02:53:54.093 --> 02:54:05.255]  So if they scan the entire building, it's unconstitutional, but the Army's contracting this now out of Science Applications International Corporation in San Diego.
[02:54:06.727 --> 02:54:08.308]  And again, I saw that a week ago.
[02:54:08.328 --> 02:54:09.509]  I didn't have time to get into it.
[02:54:09.929 --> 02:54:10.709]  Write up a blurb.
[02:54:10.809 --> 02:54:12.430]  Post it on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:14.111]  Submit stuff to Curt Nemo.
[02:54:14.151 --> 02:54:15.692]  He'll post it as stories if it's good.
[02:54:15.932 --> 02:54:17.753]  Just write your comments and a link to the story.
[02:54:18.073 --> 02:54:19.233]  We can't track it all.
[02:54:19.714 --> 02:54:23.275]  What, for 10 years they now have handheld backpack systems that look through your walls?
[02:54:23.756 --> 02:54:26.797]  I mean, this is Big Brother and they're now just doing it.
[02:54:26.837 --> 02:54:28.878]  Yeah, we're just going to look through your walls all the time.
[02:54:29.338 --> 02:54:30.539]  They've already tethered blimps.
[02:54:30.899 --> 02:54:34.543]  The television has been prostituting Barack Obama as the new JFK so I think the callers might be
[02:54:47.663 --> 02:55:16.208]  on to something because uh... that's the only way hillary clinton would get in as president because when you know i know i i i thought they were going to really was behind her but i think that you know it's going to happen brocco bombing is scary and they will try to make you like this hollywood type of shrieking fainting women he's total new world order uh... who's calling from new york matthew matthew in new york hit me yes hello i just want to ask one question i thought the movie obsession the other day and uh... he was kind of
[02:55:16.567 --> 02:55:25.189]  Typical sort of Fox News sort of portrayal of things, and it had some true things, but the question I had about it was the 7-7 bombers.
[02:55:26.929 --> 02:55:30.090]  I know everything you said about it, and it sounds very convincing.
[02:55:30.190 --> 02:55:31.350]  I haven't seen Obsession.
[02:55:31.410 --> 02:55:31.790]  What is it?
[02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:35.691]  Oh, it's the movie about Islamic terrorism and extremism.
[02:55:36.191 --> 02:55:41.212]  Now, the one question I have, though, is the 7-7 bombers all did martyr tapes.
[02:55:41.432 --> 02:55:46.393]  They all did their talks beforehand, where they talked about how they were doing what they were going to do for Allah and all that.
[02:55:46.926 --> 02:55:51.528]  And I'm just wondering, how does that square with what we know about the drills that day by the government?
[02:55:51.548 --> 02:55:53.028]  I'm going to write a note tomorrow.
[02:55:53.068 --> 02:55:54.429]  I'm going to try to answer that.
[02:55:54.829 --> 02:55:57.050]  It's very sophisticated how they do this.
[02:55:57.470 --> 02:56:00.451]  All we know is the government was running drills, the exact same thing happening.
[02:56:00.991 --> 02:56:05.933]  Those people were probably being paid as part of drills and thought that they were part of a simulation.
[02:56:05.973 --> 02:56:08.954]  We know that happened with the 9-11 hijackers.
[02:56:08.974 --> 02:56:10.095]  I am out of time.
[02:56:10.795 --> 02:56:11.796]  I'm going to write a note.
[02:56:11.856 --> 02:56:13.338]  If I don't remember tomorrow, call in.
[02:56:13.378 --> 02:56:15.080]  Remind me to cover that on the Friday show.
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:17.942]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:18.223 --> 02:56:19.184]  The show isn't over.
[02:56:19.204 --> 02:56:22.487]  If you're listening on the internet, you can come right back at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:22.787 --> 02:56:27.592]  If you missed any of Peter Del Scott in the first hour with martial law, we really cover key info.
