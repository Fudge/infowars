[00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:06.855]  99.9% of deadly MRSA, black mold, E. coli, bird flu, and more from all surfaces.
[00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:09.178]  Germfree33.com.
[00:00:09.278 --> 00:00:11.320]  Remove pollen, mold, pet dander.
[00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:20.568]  I have never heard anything like it in my life.
[00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.053]  National radio host, Michael Reagan.
[00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:32.177]  Called for the extrajudicial, no trial, the 9-11 truthers be killed.
[00:00:32.878 --> 00:00:33.779]  We just played the clip.
[00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.781]  He said we should all be taken out and killed.
[00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:36.821]  And he said, I'm serious.
[00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:38.283]  I want them dead.
[00:00:38.303 --> 00:00:40.004]  I will pay for the bullets.
[00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:41.826]  Kill us now.
[00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:47.691]  Ladies and gentlemen, this country is in the greatest crisis it's ever seen.
[00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:51.975]  If it falls, it will be a greater engine of evil than Nazi Germany was.
[00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.628]  It's already fallen to the Bush regime and they've destroyed our name.
[00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.551]  They've destroyed our currency.
[00:01:01.152 --> 00:01:03.534]  They've destroyed our treasury.
[00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:07.938]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution is being dismantled.
[00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:14.304]  The leader of the Tories resigned yesterday saying that he basically discovered the government was setting up a dictatorship in England.
[00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:22.640]  Evil is moving across the face of the world, and in the midst of that evil there are incredible patriots who I just get more and more respect for.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.701]  Dennis Kucinich, I have to say, really is the leader now against this tyranny.
[00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.882]  I have to say that Ron Paul isn't even as strong as he is when it comes to speaking out.
[00:01:33.962 --> 00:01:36.943]  Ron Paul did sign on to the 35 articles of impeachment.
[00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:37.923]  We salute him for that.
[00:01:38.603 --> 00:01:39.924]  But I have to tell you, Dennis Kucinich
[00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:45.088]  In this very dark climate has courage that no one else in Congress.
[00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:54.819]  I've not seen it and I assure you he needs our prayers because this is a very wicked group and the mainstream media has tried to ignore it.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.801]  Cafferty and others on
[00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:09.695]  CNN and MSNBC with some of the other shows like Countdown and Overman have been calling for impeachment but not really talking about the fact that Dennis Kucinich is pushing for it.
[00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:11.296]  The congressman joins us, very busy.
[00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.277]  He's with us for the next 25 minutes for the rest of this hour.
[00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:20.039]  You can go to Kucinich.house.gov and read the 35 articles of impeachment.
[00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:24.801]  You can also go to Infowars.com and see the YouTube clips of his speech he gave a few days ago.
[00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:26.942]  Dennis Kucinich, I just
[00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:32.204]  I absolutely want to praise what you're doing for the Republic.
[00:02:32.804 --> 00:02:36.826]  You really are doing something, as you know, that takes a lot of courage.
[00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:43.510]  Alex, thank you very much for those kind words and for the honor of being on your show.
[00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:54.595]  Your listeners are particularly attuned to the erosion of democratic principles and what led me to finally introduce these articles.
[00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:08.674]  Was the totality of the offenses and the ongoing violations, and the possibility that we could even end up in another war, based on lies.
[00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:13.955]  We are losing our country to lies, to erosion of our civil liberties.
[00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:19.837]  We've moved in a direction that's profoundly anti-democratic, and Congress has a constitutional responsibility
[00:03:20.413 --> 00:03:23.377]  To put a check on an executive abuse of power.
[00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:25.580]  That's what these articles of impeachment will do.
[00:03:25.641 --> 00:03:36.376]  And they not only set a historic benchmark for, and a historic record for future generations, but they also send a message to whoever would be the next president.
[00:03:37.034 --> 00:03:42.058]  That such usurpations and abuses are not going to be tolerated.
[00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:55.107]  Congressman, just to break down for those that don't know the process, you basically have brought charges to the equivalent of the grand jury, which is the House, which will then decide whether or not to indict, then it will go to a trial in the Senate.
[00:03:55.727 --> 00:03:57.748]  If Richard Nixon, who did one-one
[00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.571]  Hundreds, literally, of what Bush and his crime syndicate have done.
[00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:17.321]  And if Clinton deserved, for what he did, to be indicted in the House, there is no doubt that George Bush and his group of cronies must be indicted just to get our country's name back and to let the police and military know that what they've been ordered to do is illegal.
[00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:20.484]  Because now we see the precedent set for all forms of tyranny.
[00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:27.688]  Can you walk through how important it is that people get behind this process and how do we, you know, A, what has Bush and his crime syndicate done?
[00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:27.728]  B,
[00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.310]  How do we help you get this done?
[00:04:31.191 --> 00:04:47.242]  Alex, the first thing that I want to say, after listening to the way that you provided a capsule summary, is that you yourself are someone who needs to be appreciated for your understanding what's happening, your willingness to communicate it to people.
[00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:49.283]  So I thank you for understanding.
[00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:56.268]  I thank you for understanding the scope of the challenge that we face, and for outlining it in a way that you have, because it essentially
[00:04:57.252 --> 00:05:10.558]  We, you know, these charges have to be presented to the Judiciary Committee, which then will hopefully hold a hearing and send it to the House for the report, which then will be voted on.
[00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:14.180]  And if the President is impeached in the House, he would go on trial in the Senate.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.842]  This whole, this is a moment where
[00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:28.576]  We have the opportunity to reclaim our government and to reclaim all that's good and right in America and what we stand for, not only with respect to each other, but what we stand for in the world.
[00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.697]  I love this country.
[00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:36.740]  I get chills when I watch the flag pass by in a parade.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:45.745]  I wear an American flag because a blind person gave it to me because it has USA and Braille on it.
[00:05:46.334 --> 00:05:49.857]  So then even a blind person would know I'm wearing this flag because I love this country.
[00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:50.678]  I love the flag.
[00:05:50.718 --> 00:05:53.620]  I love what America has historically stood for.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.946]  But I see our country as it's being destroyed by people who don't want to obey the law and just want to be a law unto themselves.
[00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:10.855]  That's why there's got to be an accounting for the loss of lives of our soldiers that have been sent there on a mission that was not based in truth.
[00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:27.789]  There's got to be an accounting for the injuries to them, there's got to be an accounting for the innocent Iraqis who have died, for the huge amounts of money that we're borrowing to be able to keep this war going, and every other president who has been held to a measure of accounting.
[00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.350]  Their offenses pale.
[00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.871]  In comparison to the offenses of this President.
[00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:36.372]  And you've put out 35.
[00:06:36.432 --> 00:06:39.833]  Let's just cover 5 or 6 of what you think are most important.
[00:06:39.853 --> 00:06:40.774]  They're all very important.
[00:06:41.514 --> 00:06:43.775]  Of those 35, Congressman Dennis Kucinich.
[00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:50.738]  Well, you know, the ones that deal with Iraq really talk about manufacturing a false case for war.
[00:06:51.138 --> 00:07:00.162]  And it's been just demonstrated over and over that all the representations that were made that Iraq supposedly had weapons of mass destruction, posing imminent threat,
[00:07:01.074 --> 00:07:04.696]  Uh, that, uh, it had something to do with 9-11 or Al Qaeda's role in 9-11.
[00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:12.340]  All of those, uh, attempts to try to get the American people to believe that an organized effort was made, in fact, were based in falsehood.
[00:07:13.301 --> 00:07:17.983]  Um, and it was so, uh, a war of aggression was begun against a country that did not attack us.
[00:07:18.924 --> 00:07:22.386]  Uh, and such a war is in violation of international law.
[00:07:23.406 --> 00:07:29.630]  Uh, the, uh, which puts George Bush within the reach of an international tribunal.
[00:07:30.256 --> 00:07:32.458]  This is why Congress needs to become involved.
[00:07:32.478 --> 00:07:38.383]  We cannot let other governments or other jurisdictions do our work for us.
[00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:48.591]  We need to look at the record and recognize that law has been violated and it has to become a matter of a systematic public examination when that happens.
[00:07:49.812 --> 00:07:52.595]  You know, it's said that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.
[00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:56.338]  This country will begin to be freed from the grip of fear.
[00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:09.068]  Which has been placed its clammy hold on us since 9-11, and the capitalization on the events of 9-11, for political purposes, will end.
[00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:10.888]  And we'll get our country back.
[00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:12.508]  This is about getting our country back.
[00:08:13.308 --> 00:08:25.651]  Re-establishing the rule of law, getting back our civil liberties, putting aside, you know, enforcing posse comitatus, making sure there's no more torture, wiretapping, eavesdropping, or any of the things that
[00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:27.129]  That are un-American.
[00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:36.553]  We're going to reclaim America and the Impeachment Resolution and 35 articles are intent on doing just that.
[00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:40.734]  You've got quite a few co-sponsors just a few days into this.
[00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:43.235]  Tell us about that process, sir.
[00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:50.437]  Well, the bill just went to Judiciary yesterday and Congress adjourned for the week early in the day.
[00:08:51.778 --> 00:08:55.619]  We have now three co-sponsors, Congressman Wexler,
[00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:59.402]  Congresswoman Lee and Woolsey have co-sponsored.
[00:08:59.862 --> 00:09:05.524]  Next week will be an opportunity for people to become co-sponsors.
[00:09:05.564 --> 00:09:12.507]  I would ask your listeners to please call their member of Congress and indicate your support for co-sponsorship.
[00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:24.451]  I would ask everyone who's listening, please read the Articles of Impeachment, because the more conversant you are, the more fluent you'll be in talking to Congressional staff about the urgency of members of Congress getting onto it.
[00:09:25.214 --> 00:09:52.212]  uh... my information is available on my website at consens.us and certainly uh... you know if you check there's a hundred thousand places on the web by now that i have information about the articles of impeachment uh... you know this is the time for us all to get involved so what you can do is is learn about it read about it be conversant in it contact a member of congress make sure that they've read it ask them to support the resolution hr uh... twelve fifty-eight
[00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:53.755]  And then demand hearings.
[00:09:53.995 --> 00:09:54.876]  We have to have hearings.
[00:09:54.936 --> 00:09:57.337]  We cannot avert our eyes.
[00:09:57.458 --> 00:09:58.238]  So that's the key.
[00:09:58.638 --> 00:10:00.840]  The hearings will open up this evidence.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.245]  It will become a televised spectacle, which is what we need, so more people learn about the crimes that have committed.
[00:10:07.265 --> 00:10:08.226]  And by the way, you had to stop at 35.
[00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:11.588]  There were, I mean, what about a million dead Iraqis?
[00:10:11.628 --> 00:10:20.014]  What about, I mean, when you add it all together, frankly, I've got to say that yours is very measured, and I would call even conservative, as bad as the 35 are.
[00:10:20.034 --> 00:10:20.915]  Now, I had read that
[00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:24.916]  Twenty-five congressmen and women had, quote, signed onto it.
[00:10:24.956 --> 00:10:26.117]  I've seen a media blurb.
[00:10:26.757 --> 00:10:29.298]  I guess that means they have publicly said they're supporting it.
[00:10:29.638 --> 00:10:32.019]  They just haven't had a... They may be confused about that.
[00:10:32.059 --> 00:10:34.239]  That may have related to the Cheney impeachment.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.601]  I'm not aware that we have 25 co-sponsors, but I will find that out immediately.
[00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:41.642]  All right.
[00:10:43.403 --> 00:10:46.804]  How soon until we'll find out if we're able to force hearings in the House?
[00:10:48.124 --> 00:10:49.425]  Well, here's what I've said.
[00:10:51.232 --> 00:10:52.553]  We need to start making calls.
[00:10:52.593 --> 00:10:57.557]  And all next week, we need to be calling members of Congress and encouraging them to sign on.
[00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:02.961]  And also encouraging them to ask for hearings in judiciary.
[00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:12.709]  I'm going to be meeting with the Chairman of Judiciary and also with members of the Judiciary Committee, providing them with backup documentation for the charges that are in the articles.
[00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:20.895]  I feel it's important that they have a little bit of time to be able to read them and digest them and make a decision.
[00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:38.542]  I've made it clear, though, that in the face of statements by the House leadership that this thing is dead on arrival, that unlike other resolutions where, in fact, if you introduce a bill that goes to committee, there are oral hearings, it is dead, a privilege resolution is one that you can bring back again.
[00:11:39.202 --> 00:11:49.550]  So I've made it very clear, if there's no action within 30 days, I will come back with 60 articles of impeachment and stand on the House floor for eight hours.
[00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:51.305]  And read them.
[00:11:51.686 --> 00:11:55.728]  And so that the nation can once again hear what's going on.
[00:11:55.808 --> 00:12:02.150]  Congressman, I could never imagine reading these 35 articles of impeachment a more provable case.
[00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:12.395]  I mean, in their own memos, their own executive orders, their own Pentagon battle plans, this fake newscast, paying for fake media, agents of influence.
[00:12:12.455 --> 00:12:14.116]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:12:14.156 --> 00:12:15.637]  This morning I ran across a story
[00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:30.044]  That I'd forgotten about from a few months ago, London Guardian Associated Press, where John McCain went to a fundraiser in London, raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, admitted it was illegal, there's no debating each count as a felony, and then he just said, so what?
[00:12:30.104 --> 00:12:35.466]  I mean, that's just another example of the government on every level is just going completely lawless.
[00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:36.706]  What has happened?
[00:12:36.726 --> 00:12:40.667]  It's like a... Well, let me tell you, people who
[00:12:41.941 --> 00:12:42.842]  Our U.S.
[00:12:42.902 --> 00:12:53.566]  expatriates, people who live in another country, but are citizens of the United States, can contribute to the campaign of a federal candidate.
[00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:54.927]  But they admitted these weren't U.S.
[00:12:54.947 --> 00:12:55.827]  citizens or expatriates.
[00:12:55.847 --> 00:12:57.188]  Well, that's a whole different deal.
[00:12:57.268 --> 00:12:59.009]  I mean, I don't know, this is the first I've heard of it.
[00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.409]  That was the Rothschild meeting, yes.
[00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:01.210]  Wow.
[00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:06.432]  Well, my concern here is that in upholding the rule of law,
[00:13:07.712 --> 00:13:13.598]  We are basically correcting, you know, correcting the direction of our ship of state.
[00:13:13.638 --> 00:13:13.938]  That's it!
[00:13:14.038 --> 00:13:16.701]  We're complicit if we don't do what you're doing right now.
[00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:19.784]  We have a moral obligation to get behind Dennis Kucinich.
[00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:23.147]  Yeah, Alex, I appreciate that.
[00:13:23.187 --> 00:13:32.155]  I also want to say that I've just had my office check the impeachment resolution with respect to Vice President Cheney at 27 coast boundaries.
[00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:42.415]  Our bill that we just introduced, and people had to put their name in as they were leaving for the break for the weekend, we have three.
[00:13:42.696 --> 00:13:46.441]  So by next week, I'm confident that
[00:13:47.307 --> 00:13:50.430]  People hear from their constituents around the country that they'll come back and sign on.
[00:13:50.710 --> 00:14:05.742]  Congressman, with trillions missing from the Pentagon, three trillion spent on the war, you haven't heard the clip, but we played it earlier, of Michael Reagan saying that 9-11 truthers should be taken out some early and killed without trials, and he said, I will pay for the bullets.
[00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:09.825]  And I've seen similar rhetoric from these neocons in talk radio.
[00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:14.407]  It seems like they're cornered now and that they're more dangerous than ever.
[00:14:14.427 --> 00:14:15.008]  Can you speak?
[00:14:15.328 --> 00:14:21.290]  I mean, are you getting a sense, because you're up there in the catbird seat in Congress, that things are coming to a head right now?
[00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:29.053]  We, you know, our country, these events over the last seven years have really divided our country.
[00:14:30.533 --> 00:14:32.094]  And we need to find a way to unite.
[00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:33.074]  We can unite in truth.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:41.028]  We need to understand that there's just deep concern that people have on all sides that
[00:14:41.838 --> 00:14:46.621]  That things are unfair and that people are being unfairly accused.
[00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:48.642]  Well, that's why we need hearings to bring it all out.
[00:14:49.183 --> 00:14:54.446]  Well, you've been championing the fact that we have the EPA report that the dust was deadly and they covered it up.
[00:14:54.806 --> 00:15:02.731]  Now they've had to basically admit a lot of that in scientific studies and we're called traitors for even saying we should give health care to the firemen and police.
[00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:07.034]  Well, I felt, you're correct in what you just said, but I will say this.
[00:15:08.447 --> 00:15:36.513]  That I feel strongly enough about bringing out the truth about 9-11 that I brought forth articles that for the first time make 9-11 truth a serious discussion in articles of impeachment, the obstruction of the investigation into the attacks of 9-11,
[00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:48.019]  The fact that the administration repeatedly ignored and failed to respond to high-level intelligence warnings of a planned attack.
[00:15:48.059 --> 00:15:51.802]  You've got them there, and they were caught lying to Congress on that!
[00:15:52.142 --> 00:16:06.094]  And the fact that the 9-11, those who responded to 9-11, were not told of the dangers to their health, and so they were encouraged to go forward without providing adequate protection.
[00:16:06.753 --> 00:16:10.958]  And that's an article as well, Endangering Health and 9-11 First Responders.
[00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:14.081]  Congressman, shifting gears, we don't have a lot of time, we've just got the next segment.
[00:16:15.062 --> 00:16:25.332]  I know you're a confident, manly guy, you don't like to talk about issues like this, but we know that we've had a lot of suspicious planes blowing up, people committing suicide, people falling downstairs.
[00:16:25.973 --> 00:16:30.995]  You know in the 23rd Psalm, which is always worth reading, it says, Though I walk through the valley of shadows, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[00:16:31.496 --> 00:16:32.476]  And I think we have to have confidence
[00:16:55.942 --> 00:17:03.388]  That there is a spiritual dimension in life which is always, you know, that we always move in.
[00:17:04.408 --> 00:17:18.539]  And when we do that, it's like whatever the will of that spiritual dimension is, some call it God, and I'll call it God, whatever the will of God is, is something that
[00:17:19.944 --> 00:17:20.965]  Whatever will be, will be.
[00:17:21.045 --> 00:17:22.626]  But I don't worry about that.
[00:17:22.926 --> 00:17:23.647]  I never worry about it.
[00:17:23.827 --> 00:17:29.270]  Congressman, I'm getting from you that you're committed, that you're just going to do your duty, and the consequences belong to God.
[00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:38.937]  I think we are here on this planet to do the work of God.
[00:17:39.237 --> 00:17:43.040]  And you know, now some people will
[00:17:44.472 --> 00:17:46.093]  talk about it in a spiritual sense.
[00:17:46.153 --> 00:17:48.875]  Others will say we're aligning with a higher purpose.
[00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:50.015]  Well, however you want to describe it.
[00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:55.338]  I think that we're here for a higher purpose, and so I try to live that.
[00:17:55.798 --> 00:18:00.061]  And each of us has an opportunity to do it every day in the work that we do.
[00:18:00.921 --> 00:18:02.902]  Congressman, final segment with you straight ahead.
[00:18:02.922 --> 00:18:04.883]  We'll be back in about two minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:05.264 --> 00:18:06.424]  This is history, you're seeing.
[00:18:06.444 --> 00:18:08.305]  We've all got to pray for the Congressman.
[00:18:10.947 --> 00:18:12.668]  Now, let me talk to the Congressman real fast.
[00:18:13.908 --> 00:18:22.290]  And you know, now some people will talk about it in a spiritual sense, others will say we're aligning with a higher purpose, however you want to describe it.
[00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:27.631]  I think that we're here for a higher purpose, and so I try to live that.
[00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:32.332]  And each of us has an opportunity to do it every day in the work that we do.
[00:18:33.252 --> 00:18:35.233]  Congressman, final segment with you straight ahead.
[00:18:35.273 --> 00:18:37.233]  We'll be back in about two minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:37.593 --> 00:18:38.754]  This is history you're seeing.
[00:18:38.774 --> 00:18:40.594]  We've all got to pray for the Congressman.
[00:18:43.195 --> 00:18:55.903]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:18:56.343 --> 00:19:00.145]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:19:00.505 --> 00:19:07.029]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:10.591]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:19:10.812 --> 00:19:18.316]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:19:34.348 --> 00:19:36.610]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:42.315]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:47.579]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.083]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.830]  I'm not bringing it up because of fear.
[00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:59.532]  I'm bringing it up because they seem like they're... It's a practical consideration.
[00:19:59.572 --> 00:20:01.552]  Look, with these guys, are you kidding?
[00:20:01.693 --> 00:20:04.353]  I mean, I know that, but you know what?
[00:20:05.234 --> 00:20:16.017]  The one thing I want to share with you, I don't put any fear out there, even in thinking, because we bring to ourselves that which we fear, and someone who's truly fearless
[00:20:17.577 --> 00:20:19.119]  Can't be touched.
[00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:19.940]  Oh, I agree with you.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.102]  It's not even fear that I have.
[00:20:21.122 --> 00:20:26.489]  I was telling you about it because it seems like they're getting more agitated and more dangerous than ever.
[00:20:26.509 --> 00:20:26.829]  Oh, are you?
[00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:27.710]  Oh, the hysteria.
[00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:28.351]  Absolutely.
[00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:30.554]  Well, you know what?
[00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:34.319]  They're bothering you because you're a person of consequence when you speak.
[00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:37.540]  It starts to have an effect, and we have to all speak.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.920]  Well, I just want to say this.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:47.983]  I've been honored to call you a friend, and I've been honored just to even get to talk to you and to be associated with somebody like yourself, Congressman.
[00:20:48.023 --> 00:20:51.284]  And I have to tell you, you've been the only true bold voice.
[00:20:51.504 --> 00:20:55.965]  I like Congressman Ron Paul, supported him, and I'm not criticizing him.
[00:20:56.005 --> 00:21:01.247]  It's just that, really, you're starting to overshadow him, I have to be honest, in your boldness.
[00:21:01.267 --> 00:21:02.467]  We're going live right now, sir.
[00:21:02.647 --> 00:21:04.868]  Can we keep you to five after, or do you want to go in five minutes?
[00:21:05.228 --> 00:21:07.896]  I'm going to have to go in five minutes, and let's talk again soon.
[00:21:08.036 --> 00:21:08.578]  Okay, thank you.
[00:21:08.598 --> 00:21:09.159]  We're going live now.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:09.581]  Here we go.
[00:21:19.283 --> 00:21:27.249]  Alright, final segment with Congressman Kucinich.
[00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.870]  We salute him.
[00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.211]  We want to support his impeachment.
[00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:31.112]  Go learn the 35 articles.
[00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:33.594]  Learn what is documented and what's happening.
[00:21:34.555 --> 00:21:36.156]  Just amazing the courage he's got.
[00:21:36.196 --> 00:21:40.419]  And we were talking during the break just about how he's committed and that's just the end of it.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.361]  We've got about four minutes.
[00:21:42.441 --> 00:21:44.723]  Anything else you think is key that people should know, Congressman?
[00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:54.260]  We're in a period where we need to reclaim our country, and that we cannot put on hold domestic law, international law, or constitutional law.
[00:21:54.801 --> 00:22:03.011]  There's no logical explanation for this impeachment being put on the table, or put off the table.
[00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:19.504]  This impeachment process can be very good for our country in kind of recalibrating our moral compass and helping to educate people as to what's going on and bring about a consciousness shift that aligns us again with our basic principles upon which this country was founded.
[00:22:19.524 --> 00:22:24.448]  We've got to break this Washington mindset of insularity and unaccountability.
[00:22:24.924 --> 00:22:28.409]  And reach out and reconnect with each other, and with people all over the globe.
[00:22:28.969 --> 00:22:35.278]  This isn't about Democrat or Republican, it's not about right or left, it's about the truth, and the truth doesn't have a political party.
[00:22:36.684 --> 00:22:39.747]  Well, Congressman, I totally agree with you on that.
[00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:51.740]  We were talking during the break about how they're acting like cornered rats, but that shows that we're really having success here, and when you talk about how this is the right thing to do, it is a fight between good and evil.
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.523]  There's no doubt true evil has reared its head in our time, in our country.
[00:22:56.244 --> 00:22:59.326]  And I don't see how anybody out there would not get off the fence.
[00:22:59.406 --> 00:23:03.348]  What are some of the basic things that average Joes can do?
[00:23:03.368 --> 00:23:07.430]  I mean, go when their congressman or woman is in the local district, shake them up?
[00:23:07.551 --> 00:23:14.815]  First, it is important that everyone reads these articles, because we need to be conversant in what the issues are.
[00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:24.360]  The next thing is, call your member of Congress, and ask that member to read the articles, and after doing so, to sign on to House Resolution 1258.
[00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:30.228]  And then encourage us also the hearings in judiciary.
[00:23:30.608 --> 00:23:34.891]  Now I have said, you know, people said, well this thing, they're not going to hold any hearings, this thing is a dead deal.
[00:23:35.392 --> 00:23:39.955]  I have said that I'll be back with 60 articles in a month if they don't hold any hearings.
[00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:41.476]  We're not going to let this go.
[00:23:41.496 --> 00:23:42.757]  This is not going to go away.
[00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:51.784]  We're going to continue to, in our efforts to save this country from this calamity of deception and of anti-democratic
[00:23:53.875 --> 00:23:59.939]  Behavior and destruction of the law, international law as well as domestic, and the destruction of our Constitution.
[00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:00.940]  I believe in America.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.081]  I love this country.
[00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:02.521]  I do too.
[00:24:02.581 --> 00:24:10.026]  Congressman, in closing, I would liken this to a new Declaration of Independence and people will rally to it and push it and expose it.
[00:24:10.046 --> 00:24:14.429]  And if we can get hearings, they will be brought down and we can get our name back.
[00:24:14.449 --> 00:24:15.310]  Do you agree with that statement?
[00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.731]  I think that's right.
[00:24:18.274 --> 00:24:19.235]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:24:19.275 --> 00:24:20.055]  Thank you, Congressman.
[00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:21.876]  Well, you've got several websites.
[00:24:21.896 --> 00:24:22.837]  Which one should we visit?
[00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:24.518]  Cassinich.us.
[00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:27.240]  Cassinich.us.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.101]  And go in there.
[00:24:28.141 --> 00:24:29.522]  That's my website.
[00:24:29.602 --> 00:24:32.844]  If you sign up, we'll keep you posted on events as they unfold.
[00:24:33.064 --> 00:24:34.165]  I know you're a very busy man.
[00:24:34.185 --> 00:24:35.385]  We've got about a minute left with you.
[00:24:36.046 --> 00:24:38.147]  Can we get you back on in the next few weeks?
[00:24:38.668 --> 00:24:44.872]  It would be good if we talked in another week or so so we could bring you up to date.
[00:24:44.932 --> 00:24:47.353]  Maybe we should do it just before the 4th of July.
[00:24:47.393 --> 00:24:47.954]  That would be great.
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.524]  Alright, Congressman, thank you so much and again we salute you.
[00:24:52.825 --> 00:24:56.749]  We're all behind you and right beside you and say hi to your wife and great staff for us.
[00:24:56.869 --> 00:24:57.490]  Thanks for coming on.
[00:24:58.143 --> 00:24:59.504]  Thanks to you and your listeners, Alex.
[00:24:59.604 --> 00:24:59.945]  Thank you.
[00:25:00.105 --> 00:25:00.365]  Wow.
[00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:02.026]  There goes Congressman Dennis Kucinich.
[00:25:02.086 --> 00:25:05.809]  And folks, I have criticized him on a few issues, but the guy is genuine.
[00:25:05.849 --> 00:25:06.890]  The guy is real.
[00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:09.933]  He is such a great speaker.
[00:25:09.973 --> 00:25:11.654]  He speaks from the heart and from history.
[00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:15.958]  And the enemy is completely out of control right now.
[00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:17.439]  They are very dangerous.
[00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:18.880]  They know they've wrecked this country.
[00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:20.822]  They know they've tripled the size of government.
[00:25:20.862 --> 00:25:23.824]  They know they've committed all these crimes, and they're going for broke.
[00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:26.606]  And I don't know what new events they're going to stage or what.
[00:25:26.646 --> 00:25:28.067]  We've got to keep them off balance.
[00:25:28.807 --> 00:25:31.008]  We've got to continue to expose the left-right paradigm.
[00:25:32.108 --> 00:25:38.011]  Or, I mean, just the economic crises is looming depression, mainstream news.
[00:25:39.892 --> 00:25:41.533]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[00:25:41.773 --> 00:25:45.935]  And I can hardly sleep lately, the way things are moving so fast.
[00:25:46.275 --> 00:25:47.635]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
[00:25:47.675 --> 00:25:48.136]  Stay with us.
[00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:52.698]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:55.899 --> 00:25:58.201]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:02.145]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:26:02.425 --> 00:26:05.889]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:07.890]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:26:08.371 --> 00:26:11.234]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:26:11.554 --> 00:26:17.019]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:21.203]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:26:21.503 --> 00:26:26.425]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:26:26.705 --> 00:26:29.466]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:26:47.534 --> 00:26:56.061]  The medication for a little while it would maybe work and then it wouldn't and we were he was going back and forth and my husband's not the type that he wants to go to the doctor anyway he'll wait till he
[00:27:14.685 --> 00:27:16.706]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:27:17.286 --> 00:27:20.147]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:23.849 --> 00:27:24.389]  Welcome back.
[00:27:24.449 --> 00:27:25.670]  We have Keith Byrne.
[00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.090]  We are Change Ireland.
[00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:30.872]  The polls show that we're going to win the Lisbon Treaty.
[00:27:33.273 --> 00:27:35.794]  A few months ago, but We Are Change Ireland energized.
[00:27:35.814 --> 00:27:38.935]  They made a film using a lot of endgame.
[00:27:39.475 --> 00:27:41.396]  It went number one in Ireland Googled.
[00:27:42.176 --> 00:27:43.237]  Millions saw it.
[00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:44.575]  Millions.
[00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:49.696]  And they are credited, even by mainstream press, as helping mobilize people against it.
[00:27:49.736 --> 00:27:53.217]  It looks like it's going down in defeat as of right now.
[00:27:53.737 --> 00:27:59.878]  Talking to people on the streets, I've talked to Keith and others with We Are Change Ireland, and they're saying 10 to 1.
[00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:02.598]  Taxi cab drivers say they're asking all their fares.
[00:28:02.638 --> 00:28:04.018]  They're saying 10 to 1 against it.
[00:28:04.398 --> 00:28:12.820]  So there's definitely election fraud, but it looks like that the landslide against it is so huge that they may not be able to cheat and say that the treaty went through.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.440]  Now let's explain.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:25.147]  In 50 years of the European Union, which they didn't announce that it existed until 2000, but they had the 50th anniversary in 2007, they have only allowed three referendums.
[00:28:26.207 --> 00:28:26.547]  Okay?
[00:28:26.668 --> 00:28:31.350]  And the one in France and the other there in Europe failed.
[00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:32.151]  That was in 2005.
[00:28:32.191 --> 00:28:32.491]  Big defeat.
[00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:43.315]  Now, they're already under the Euro, but that was to get rid of any national sovereignty and any power their governments had and make the EU president basically a dictator, and that's mainstream news saying that.
[00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:54.038]  I mean, it's in paper that they'll run everything, total regulation, total taxes, greenhouse taxes, total micromanagement, hellish control, attacking free speech, everything.
[00:28:55.699 --> 00:28:59.300]  Now, they've been propagandizing for about four years in Ireland, and to build up to this,
[00:29:00.493 --> 00:29:01.553]  And they're now reporting.
[00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:03.954]  I want to go to Paul Watson first, then we'll go to Ireland.
[00:29:04.334 --> 00:29:08.554]  Then I want to go to the UK first, because the UK wasn't allowed to vote on this either.
[00:29:08.794 --> 00:29:12.515]  They're trying to bring it in there by stealth, so we can understand what's being announced.
[00:29:12.815 --> 00:29:16.936]  Incredible headline, amazing analysis up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:18.056]  Get it out to everyone right now.
[00:29:18.496 --> 00:29:22.237]  EU dictators may ram through Lisbon Treaty despite Irish rejection.
[00:29:22.697 --> 00:29:28.818]  EU risks losing all legitimacy by circumventing its own laws in pursuit of a federal super state.
[00:29:29.418 --> 00:29:43.811]  And we go to Paul Watson from the UK, literally from the hometown of Robin Hood there in Sheffield, to tell us what's happening as we fight this modern day Prince John type activity.
[00:29:44.191 --> 00:29:45.612]  Paul Watson, tell us what's happening.
[00:29:46.753 --> 00:29:47.294]  Hello Alex.
[00:29:47.534 --> 00:29:47.834]  Hello.
[00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:55.041]  Yeah, basically what's happening is that the EU, as it's always been about,
[00:29:56.986 --> 00:30:21.197]  I'm continuing to pursue this federal super state no matter what referendum or treaty gets rejected by its own member states because under EU laws, even if one of its member states rejects a treaty or a constitution as has happened today, the EU under its own laws is mandated to scrap the bill.
[00:30:22.372 --> 00:30:34.262]  But in 2001 when the Irish voted on Neath Treaty and rejected it, which was similar to the Lisbon Treaty, they simply had another referendum a year later until they got the result that they wanted.
[00:30:35.253 --> 00:30:47.623]  But this time it appears as if they're even going to go a step further than that, and simply ignore the Irish rejection of the Lisbon Treaty today, and push ahead and run through with it anyway.
[00:30:47.943 --> 00:30:52.727]  Paul, go through the details of why they're beginning to make noises that this is the case.
[00:30:52.907 --> 00:30:53.568]  Tell your story.
[00:30:55.249 --> 00:31:03.436]  Well, the BBC's reporting, quote, the British government is expected to continue ratifying the EU Treaty despite its rejection by Irish voters.
[00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:04.857]  Now, I remember it was
[00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:21.663]  The Labour Party, under Blair, in their own manifesto, that promised that any EU constitution or EU treaty, which would mean further integration with the EU, would be put to a referendum in the UK.
[00:31:22.043 --> 00:31:22.923]  It never happened.
[00:31:23.404 --> 00:31:24.865]  Brown never followed up on it.
[00:31:24.905 --> 00:31:25.946]  He was a complete liar.
[00:31:27.307 --> 00:31:35.213]  So they're saying that it's going to go through in the British Parliament anyway, and the Guardian's reporting today that
[00:31:35.652 --> 00:31:45.060]  Gordon Brown actually phoned the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, quote, to assure him that the British ratification would continue.
[00:31:45.781 --> 00:31:58.392]  Yeah, under EU laws, it's supposed to completely annul the treaty if one member state rejects it, but Sarkozy and Brown are going to go ahead with it anyway, as is the President Barroso, who
[00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:06.544]  Quote, urge member states to continue ratifying the treaty insisting it was alive and we should now try to find a solution.
[00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:10.252]  So they're saying we're not going to kill it, we're going to push it through anyway.
[00:32:13.095 --> 00:32:16.198]  Showing that they are complete and total tyrants, Paul.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.903]  Shifting gears, we're going to go to Ireland.
[00:32:19.943 --> 00:32:21.564]  We are changing to keep you on with this, Paul.
[00:32:22.265 --> 00:32:32.476]  One of the main leaders of the Tories resigned saying that he's discovered, and we've played the audio, that they're trying to set up a dictatorship, that it is martial law, that it is a control grid.
[00:32:32.496 --> 00:32:33.557]  This is not a stunt.
[00:32:34.478 --> 00:32:36.239]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:32:36.299 --> 00:32:43.282]  He's saying the government's tyrannical, they're taking over, he's resigning one of the top positions in the Parliament, one of the main leaders of the Tories.
[00:32:43.643 --> 00:32:44.843]  Tell us about this development.
[00:32:46.724 --> 00:32:50.626]  Yeah, that's David.
[00:32:50.666 --> 00:32:54.808]  The 42-day law to detain people without trial for 42 days.
[00:32:57.478 --> 00:33:04.245]  Was passed by Gordon Brown and the Labour Party yesterday after a bunch of backroom deals that they managed to pull off.
[00:33:05.186 --> 00:33:12.753]  And Davis, who is on the Conservative Party, just said, that's it, I'm resigning as a moral reaction to what went down.
[00:33:13.374 --> 00:33:20.901]  And so now there's a national media demonization against Davis because he's going to try and rerun for his seat.
[00:33:22.392 --> 00:33:44.659]  So there's a big media demonization campaign against him because what he's talking about is not just the fact that detaining people without trial for 42 days is a complete abomination to any notion of a free society, but he's also talking about the control factor of what's going on in the UK with the surveillance cameras.
[00:33:44.679 --> 00:33:46.040]  He's talking about the fact that
[00:33:46.638 --> 00:33:55.406]  We live in a highly regulated society and it's becoming increasingly insane and for his own moral reasons he chose to stand down as a form of protest.
[00:33:55.986 --> 00:34:01.952]  So obviously the mass media is now demonising him in lockstep with Gordon Brown.
[00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:03.851]  Let me ask you another issue.
[00:34:04.352 --> 00:34:13.775]  You know, a bunch of We Are Change people have been arrested, detained for filming, for handing out videos on major street corners in Denver, in Canada, in the U.S.
[00:34:13.836 --> 00:34:14.416]  and Canada.
[00:34:14.956 --> 00:34:20.558]  And now, and this is huge news, Mark Dice is coming up later, Mark Dice has the idea of mailing the troops.
[00:34:21.038 --> 00:34:25.740]  And we know the neocons have programs where they mail pro-war books, pro-propaganda.
[00:34:26.261 --> 00:34:31.163]  They have these advertisement sites where you go and then they give you a member of the military to send packages to.
[00:34:32.483 --> 00:34:45.352]  And Mark Dice said, this is on Monday, he said, let's send documents, let's send Operation Northwoods, Operation Ajax, let's send Terror Storm videos to the troops, which is his First Amendment right.
[00:34:46.733 --> 00:34:50.115]  And the most amazing clip, in fact, cue it up.
[00:34:51.542 --> 00:34:56.684]  John, right where he talks about, we need to take Mark Dyson and these other 9-11 truthers out, and kill them.
[00:34:56.744 --> 00:34:58.685]  No trial, and then he'll pay for the bullets.
[00:34:58.725 --> 00:35:00.866]  He is calling for our murder.
[00:35:01.527 --> 00:35:07.990]  Michael Savage, the fake conservative, top beat Nick of the 60's, always an operative, is calling for us to be put in forced labor camps.
[00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:14.393]  I mean, the fact that they're doing this means they are really serious about coming after us.
[00:35:14.433 --> 00:35:15.193]  It doesn't scare me.
[00:35:15.533 --> 00:35:21.156]  It means we're hurting them and showing that they're really destroying this country and are not real conservatives.
[00:35:21.456 --> 00:35:22.557]  But Paul, your take on that?
[00:35:24.598 --> 00:35:29.700]  Well, I mean, it all stems from that 2006 White House memo.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:35.303]  I mean, that's before all the white al-Qaeda propaganda that started coming out.
[00:35:36.147 --> 00:35:50.113]  At the end of last year and early this year, you had a 2006 White House memo that said that conspiracy theories promulgated by the internet and DVDs are a wellspring of terrorist influence.
[00:35:50.976 --> 00:35:52.997]  Words to that effect, I'm paraphrasing.
[00:35:53.657 --> 00:36:03.581]  And now they've had the congressional hearings where they showed architects and engineers for 9-11 Truths just covering the basic math and physics, saying they're with Al-Qaeda with no evidence, total slander.
[00:36:05.382 --> 00:36:11.024]  And that's right, Michael Reagan's been invited to the White House publicly to get his talking points.
[00:36:11.864 --> 00:36:13.745]  Listeners understand, we are now being attacked.
[00:36:14.345 --> 00:36:20.488]  We've had them come out and say 9-11 Truthers are behind bombings and attacks, that we should be tased, taken to quote secret prisons.
[00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:22.188]  MSNBC, others.
[00:36:22.628 --> 00:36:27.170]  I mean, Paul, we are now the main focus of the criminals that run the government.
[00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.810]  I hope the listeners realize this.
[00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:32.031]  I mean, I keep pointing this out because we need support to continue here.
[00:36:33.832 --> 00:36:38.853]  That's right, and they're turning the anti-terror apparatus around to face us.
[00:36:39.653 --> 00:36:45.035]  And the media has just gone crazy in identifying anything as terrorism.
[00:36:45.675 --> 00:36:50.116]  They even had Fox News, when Obama gave his
[00:36:50.783 --> 00:36:50.963]  It's
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.524]  Yeah, they claim that 9-11 truth is a dangerous possibility.
[00:37:09.165 --> 00:37:17.115]  Well, they make women who aren't even Muslim who wear a scarf now, Dunkin' Donuts, take TV ads off because wearing a scarf shows you're Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:17.416 --> 00:37:20.199]  This is an insane paranoia when they are Al-Qaeda.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.901]  The government carried out the attacks.
[00:37:21.942 --> 00:37:22.502]  Let's go to...
[00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:28.040]  Keith Byrne, there with We Are Change Ireland.
[00:37:28.721 --> 00:37:29.502]  Give us a report.
[00:37:29.682 --> 00:37:31.144]  Is it officially being defeated?
[00:37:31.444 --> 00:37:33.046]  They're saying they believe it's been defeated.
[00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:36.791]  The Lisbon Treaty to bring you into the EU tyranny has been defeated.
[00:37:37.211 --> 00:37:38.953]  Give us your take on what's happening from Ireland.
[00:37:39.734 --> 00:37:42.335]  Well Alex, the way we look at it is it's a no vote here.
[00:37:42.356 --> 00:37:56.083]  The actual government have said unofficially that they have been defeated in the Lisbon Treaty and I think it was the Minister of Justice who said that it was disappointing and that they didn't get the result that they wanted.
[00:37:56.583 --> 00:38:00.705]  So it actually is a victory here right now and I think it's time that we can celebrate a little.
[00:38:01.225 --> 00:38:03.727]  But they are going to come back again somehow, we believe.
[00:38:04.676 --> 00:38:05.757]  Well, another great victory.
[00:38:05.777 --> 00:38:07.338]  This is three defeats in a row.
[00:38:07.358 --> 00:38:11.301]  Now they're going to try to put in electronic voting like they're doing in England.
[00:38:11.841 --> 00:38:14.543]  But again, showing their dictator, showing their tyrants.
[00:38:15.023 --> 00:38:17.045]  Are you excited right now, Mr. Byrne?
[00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:19.386]  Oh yeah, Alex, we're all excited here.
[00:38:19.426 --> 00:38:22.248]  And I've brought other members of the Change Chapter here in Ireland.
[00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:26.871]  We can all speak to you and give our personal stories of the journey throughout the campaign.
[00:38:28.813 --> 00:38:29.413]  Absolutely.
[00:38:29.453 --> 00:38:30.434]  This is very exciting.
[00:38:30.454 --> 00:38:32.936]  What's the spirit out there on the streets in Ireland?
[00:38:34.104 --> 00:38:35.286]  Well, I'm not too sure.
[00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:37.629]  I was in town and I was pretty excited myself.
[00:38:37.729 --> 00:38:46.961]  I didn't really get to go out to where the ballots were being counted, but I went up to another campaigning office and the atmosphere there was electric.
[00:38:47.001 --> 00:38:48.083]  People were very excited.
[00:38:49.164 --> 00:38:51.965]  Let's continue the discussion for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:38:52.005 --> 00:38:54.125]  We're streaming live right now and on my internet streams.
[00:38:54.425 --> 00:38:55.285]  This is too important.
[00:38:55.305 --> 00:38:58.386]  I've got about six other guests coming up, Ralph Nader included.
[00:38:58.766 --> 00:39:00.246]  So, Paul Watson, stay there.
[00:39:00.827 --> 00:39:02.627]  Keith Byrne, we'll be back in four minutes for everybody else.
[00:39:02.687 --> 00:39:06.568]  This is the long break for InfoWars stream listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:39:06.868 --> 00:39:07.588]  This is too important.
[00:39:07.608 --> 00:39:10.229]  We're going to continue discussions after this quick break.
[00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:11.769]  On the other side, we'll be back for everybody else.
[00:39:11.789 --> 00:39:12.149]  Stay with us.
[00:39:14.544 --> 00:39:17.806]  Okay, bring up Keith Byrne and Paul Watson.
[00:39:18.466 --> 00:39:20.327]  Paul, you want to comment on what Keith Byrne is saying?
[00:39:21.928 --> 00:39:43.318]  Yeah, it's very exciting and it's a massive setback for the EU because even though, as before with the EU Constitution, which was crudely repackaged as the Lisbon Treaty and the Nice Treaty, which the Irish were forced to vote twice on before the EU got the result it wanted, if they come back and say
[00:39:44.304 --> 00:39:45.986]  We're just going to ram it through anyway.
[00:39:46.306 --> 00:39:54.335]  Then that, in the eyes of the public and the media, they lose more legitimacy.
[00:39:55.636 --> 00:39:57.839]  Keith Byrne, all I can say is hail the Irish.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.642]  We really want to say good job there.
[00:40:02.304 --> 00:40:05.968]  They pull all sorts of fast ones, but they know everybody on the street knows they voted against it.
[00:40:06.548 --> 00:40:13.357]  There's clearly fraud and they're saying neck-and-neck a very close victory for liberty and sovereignty that Ireland has fought so hard for.
[00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:18.864]  But the fact that they're saying it's neck-and-neck shows that there was massive fraud according to everybody we've talked to in Ireland.
[00:40:20.026 --> 00:40:36.705]  Yeah Alex, well you know I looked at some actual press reports and in some rural parts of the country, especially down over the west coast, there was in one county there was for every six no votes there was one yes and even in some towns there was 84% against
[00:40:40.588 --> 00:40:41.689]  And you know what that shows?
[00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:42.529]  You know what that shows?
[00:40:42.629 --> 00:40:54.956]  In small areas where the local officials aren't corrupt, it was 8 to 2, but then let me guess, in the big cities controlled by party leaders, they were able to cheat, and I bet the treaty won in those areas.
[00:40:55.791 --> 00:41:03.334]  Yeah, well the report I've seen for Dublin was 47% yes and 53% no.
[00:41:04.655 --> 00:41:12.478]  But back again, if you go down to the south coast and some of the counties along the south coast, it was for every 3 no votes, 1 yes.
[00:41:13.878 --> 00:41:23.981]  It really is, from what I read in the newspaper, a big victory, but then when you look at the official tallies, it comes in close enough to each other.
[00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:25.562]  Yeah, it's the same thing here.
[00:41:26.282 --> 00:41:33.084]  Areas where the die-bolt machines are, the polls are never right, and then areas where the people can actually vote, you know, it's anti-New World Order.
[00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:38.767]  Look, 99% of Texans are against these toll roads on existing roads, but it still happens.
[00:41:38.987 --> 00:41:44.311]  What are the Irish going to do as they now try to ram this through, despite the fact that it looks like you voted it down?
[00:41:45.611 --> 00:41:47.613]  Well, Alex, for sure it's been voted down.
[00:41:47.633 --> 00:41:53.536]  There's that whole vibe in the town, and I've spoken to a few individuals in town, and everybody's aware that it's gone down.
[00:41:53.556 --> 00:42:01.181]  And I actually picked up the biggest newspaper in Dublin, and on the front of it, it had, we send a large resounding no.
[00:42:02.114 --> 00:42:06.795]  So it is official that they have been defeated and it clearly is a no vote.
[00:42:07.136 --> 00:42:09.876]  But like I said, we're getting ready for the next round.
[00:42:09.936 --> 00:42:11.457]  They are going to come back somehow.
[00:42:11.897 --> 00:42:15.058]  I don't know if they'll even come back through referendum.
[00:42:15.458 --> 00:42:16.218]  I'm not too sure.
[00:42:16.398 --> 00:42:17.179]  Like we said before... No, no.
[00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:18.339]  Paul has the procedure.
[00:42:18.379 --> 00:42:18.799]  Yeah, Paul.
[00:42:18.819 --> 00:42:19.699]  How are they going to come back?
[00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:20.240]  Through treaty?
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:21.820]  Through governmental votes?
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.642]  Well, what I'm saying is that it looks like they're not even going to try and reintroduce it.
[00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:28.262]  They're just going to...
[00:42:29.016 --> 00:42:33.857]  We ran it through anyway, but Rosso says they're going to work out a solution.
[00:42:33.937 --> 00:42:42.760]  Well, that's how the SPP, that's how the SPP with the North American Union works here, signed March 24, 2005, is they just don't let you vote on it.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.821]  It's all done by the bureaucracy, by the different agencies.
[00:42:49.762 --> 00:42:50.002]  Paul?
[00:42:51.182 --> 00:42:57.664]  Yeah, and they don't like the fact that the Irish people had the chance to have a vote, because when the Dutch and the
[00:42:58.266 --> 00:42:59.027]  French did in 2005.
[00:42:59.288 --> 00:43:07.962]  They rejected it because they know that the majority of the people in the EU hate the integration that's being enforced on them.
[00:43:07.982 --> 00:43:09.786]  Alright, we're going live.
[00:43:09.806 --> 00:43:11.228]  We're going back live on the main transmission.
[00:43:11.248 --> 00:43:11.528]  Here we go.
[00:43:18.809 --> 00:43:23.638]  Alright, we've got about five minutes left with Paul Watson and of course Keith Byrne from We Are Change Ireland.
[00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:24.980]  Paul joins us from England.
[00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:29.949]  He's the editor and head honcho over at PrisonPlanet.com with his brother Steve Watson.
[00:43:32.678 --> 00:43:51.307]  Gentlemen, during the behind-the-scenes, PrisonPlanet.tv, four minutes we were just doing for the main listeners, they are officially saying now in the towns, the news is saying, yes, it was beaten, they're coming back now, they're going to use the bureaucracies to try to just force it by fiat, just like our North American Union, but in that is their defeat.
[00:43:51.667 --> 00:43:57.110]  They have to show now that in the US, in Ireland, in England, in Germany, in France, in the Netherlands,
[00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:04.396]  That they don't do the will of the people, they don't follow the Constitution, they let you vote, and then if they don't like what you did, they just go ahead and do it anyways.
[00:44:04.736 --> 00:44:10.921]  That's why they need a police state and restrict free speech and have all this, because they're now just taking the gloves off and going into tyranny.
[00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:19.628]  Now we have to decide if we're going to speak up and come out of the woodwork to expose the fact that they've lost the moral high ground and discredit them, or are we going to let them come in with tyranny?
[00:44:20.409 --> 00:44:21.230]  Go ahead, Paul Watson.
[00:44:22.878 --> 00:44:26.720]  Well yeah, and that's what the EU was designed to be all along.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:35.064]  We know that as far back as the fifties when Bilderberg were first meeting, they were talking about a European Union and a single currency.
[00:44:35.104 --> 00:44:50.272]  And then I did an article a few days ago highlighting what Vladimir Bukovsky, the Soviet dissident who first revealed the psychiatric torture camps that the Soviets were running, he saw documents in the eighties
[00:44:51.079 --> 00:45:00.464]  Um, about how the European Union was designed to, uh, turn into what he called the E-U-S-S-R, a totalitarian federal super state.
[00:45:00.524 --> 00:45:02.105]  And again, the bankers want that.
[00:45:02.185 --> 00:45:04.947]  They want, quote, easy administrative control.
[00:45:04.967 --> 00:45:07.868]  As Carol Quigley wrote, call it fascist, call it communist.
[00:45:08.208 --> 00:45:16.393]  They want top-down, and they're going to use the Green Revolution as their excuse to cover up for the new consolidation and transfer of wealth for the middle class.
[00:45:16.993 --> 00:45:34.564]  Yeah Alex, another major victory and I couldn't have been doing any better with all the campaigners and all the groups and all the activists that were out on the streets.
[00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:37.586]  And Alex, do you want to speak to some of the members that helped out?
[00:45:37.946 --> 00:45:40.268]  These are real guys that are out on the streets until 10pm.
[00:45:40.528 --> 00:45:45.171]  A lot of nights, most days during the week, we have a few members... Are they there now?
[00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:46.491]  They're here right now.
[00:45:46.511 --> 00:45:52.193]  Okay, I'm going to have to get my next guest, Barbara Lowe Fisher, about the vaccines on about ten minutes late.
[00:45:52.653 --> 00:45:53.333]  Call her and let her know.
[00:45:53.353 --> 00:45:54.734]  We're going to call her at 38 after them.
[00:45:54.754 --> 00:45:59.476]  We've got Ralph Nader coming on, Mark Dice, David Edwards, about death squads in the U.S.
[00:46:00.156 --> 00:46:02.236]  Top expert, academic on that subject.
[00:46:02.537 --> 00:46:05.497]  But yes, go ahead and introduce.
[00:46:05.738 --> 00:46:06.578]  Who else do we have there?
[00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:10.659]  Alex, we have Derek, we have Johnny, and we have a guy called Brendan.
[00:46:11.259 --> 00:46:12.860]  Okay, give it to whoever you'd like.
[00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:15.723]  Who wants to go?
[00:46:16.764 --> 00:46:17.704]  Hello Alex, can you hear me?
[00:46:17.904 --> 00:46:18.805]  Yes, tell us what happened.
[00:46:18.825 --> 00:46:19.465]  Tell us who you are.
[00:46:20.306 --> 00:46:21.106]  My name is Brandon.
[00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:22.527]  It's a great victory for the Irish.
[00:46:22.607 --> 00:46:24.748]  It's a great victory for all the peoples in Europe.
[00:46:24.768 --> 00:46:27.169]  This has defeated the European bureaucrats.
[00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.131]  They had their big project.
[00:46:29.171 --> 00:46:32.853]  They had a big project that was so great, they even called it a constitution.
[00:46:33.113 --> 00:46:37.975]  When the French rejected it, and the Dutch rejected it, they used every dirty trick in the book to try to push it through.
[00:46:38.236 --> 00:46:38.896]  They changed the name
[00:46:38.936 --> 00:46:40.578]  Well it sounds like you're excited there.
[00:46:40.598 --> 00:46:41.739]  What's the mood on the streets?
[00:46:57.908 --> 00:47:13.895]  The Irish people themselves, a lot of them just didn't understand what was going on.
[00:47:14.255 --> 00:47:17.897]  They were deliberately confused by the people in Brussels and their treaty.
[00:47:18.237 --> 00:47:22.859]  So, while a lot of the people who were active in the movement, certainly they're very excited by the possibilities.
[00:47:22.879 --> 00:47:26.201]  I think it's going to take a while before the Irish fully realize exactly what this means.
[00:47:27.418 --> 00:47:28.198]  Absolutely.
[00:47:28.598 --> 00:47:29.819]  Great talking to you, sir.
[00:47:29.959 --> 00:47:31.699]  And I want to give credit where credit's due.
[00:47:31.719 --> 00:47:37.521]  You guys made a film, number one on Google Video in Ireland for months and months and months.
[00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:39.302]  And I think that really helped turn the tide.
[00:47:40.762 --> 00:47:41.202]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:47:41.242 --> 00:47:44.423]  And it couldn't have been done any better with two members, Dave and Anthony.
[00:47:44.443 --> 00:47:45.503]  They really put that together.
[00:47:45.884 --> 00:47:47.884]  But Alex, I'll introduce you to Derek.
[00:47:48.384 --> 00:47:51.245]  Derek is a very hard street activist.
[00:47:51.405 --> 00:47:52.406]  Derek, tell us.
[00:47:52.426 --> 00:47:53.446]  Derek, we're about to break.
[00:47:53.466 --> 00:47:54.106]  Tell us what happened.
[00:47:54.126 --> 00:47:54.806]  Tell us what you're doing.
[00:47:57.873 --> 00:48:01.295]  Basically, for the last few months, I've been out as much as I can.
[00:48:01.355 --> 00:48:05.317]  Cams in, leaflets, puns, bumper stickers on taxi drivers' cars.
[00:48:05.357 --> 00:48:08.199]  Now, talking to the taxi drivers, they're telling me how they're living.
[00:48:08.519 --> 00:48:09.720]  Now, they can't afford to live.
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:10.900]  They can't afford to make money.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.782]  It's all thanks to the EU-controlled regulations and that.
[00:48:16.301 --> 00:48:22.745]  So, basically, a lot of people are awake to it, they just don't see the big picture, but they can feel it in their pocket already.
[00:48:22.785 --> 00:48:35.032]  They feel it with the mortgage rates going up, you know, the cost of living, the rates at the bottom of wages, influx of mass immigration, which is, you know, it's driving undercutting Irish workers, and it's exploiting the foreign nationals coming in.
[00:48:36.218 --> 00:48:38.239]  It's international, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:38.259 --> 00:48:40.480]  We're going to come back to you guys in a moment, put you on hold now.
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:41.901]  It is international.
[00:48:41.941 --> 00:48:47.424]  The globalists are bringing in an international grid of tyranny, but all of us worldwide are brought together for liberty.
[00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:55.208]  From England to Ireland to Germany to Japan, from Russia to Mexico, from Chile to Greenland, the resistance marches on.
[00:48:55.628 --> 00:49:00.390]  Paul Watson, from the UK, Prison Planet Editor, and more with We Are Change Ireland.
[00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:03.452]  A great victory against the New World Order when we get back.
[00:49:04.617 --> 00:49:05.538]  We're on the march.
[00:49:05.998 --> 00:49:07.619]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.302]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:49:13.363 --> 00:49:13.843]  Yeah!
[00:49:13.883 --> 00:49:15.064]  The guys are in there happy!
[00:49:15.084 --> 00:49:25.231]  The makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film.
[00:49:25.311 --> 00:49:27.493]  To Greenland, the resistance marches on.
[00:49:27.953 --> 00:49:30.355]  Paul Watson, from the UK, Prison Planet editor.
[00:49:31.141 --> 00:49:32.662]  And more with We Are Change Ireland.
[00:49:32.963 --> 00:49:35.885]  A great victory against the New World Order when we get back.
[00:49:36.846 --> 00:49:37.786]  We're on the march.
[00:49:38.247 --> 00:49:39.848]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:43.471]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:49:46.724 --> 00:49:59.457]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:49:59.878 --> 00:50:03.702]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:50:04.002 --> 00:50:04.462]  We're good to go.
[00:50:27.978 --> 00:50:28.378]  We're good.
[00:50:47.336 --> 00:50:47.836]  Hi, neighbor.
[00:50:48.157 --> 00:50:50.878]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[00:50:51.459 --> 00:50:56.181]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[00:50:56.742 --> 00:51:01.865]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[00:51:02.465 --> 00:51:09.550]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:14.973]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[00:51:15.593 --> 00:51:22.638]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[00:51:23.418 --> 00:51:27.841]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[00:51:28.522 --> 00:51:28.802]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:51:28.822 --> 00:51:28.882]  800-409-5633.
[00:51:28.902 --> 00:51:29.862]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:51:29.902 --> 00:51:30.183]  Who am I?
[00:51:30.223 --> 00:51:30.363]  Nobody.
[00:51:30.403 --> 00:51:31.504]  Steve Schenck, Someone Who Cares.
[00:51:49.471 --> 00:51:51.532]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:51:52.153 --> 00:52:01.077]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:52:01.598 --> 00:52:08.762]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:52:09.462 --> 00:52:14.945]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die, with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:52:15.445 --> 00:52:18.267]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radi-
[00:52:22.947 --> 00:52:24.188]  I salute Ireland.
[00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:25.949]  I salute the Netherlands.
[00:52:26.049 --> 00:52:27.029]  I salute France.
[00:52:30.151 --> 00:52:32.312]  Over there they don't deny the EU exists.
[00:52:33.133 --> 00:52:33.613]  They admit it.
[00:52:33.633 --> 00:52:39.256]  But they didn't for the first 40 plus years of its embryonic growth.
[00:52:39.716 --> 00:52:42.338]  Now everything is compounded, accelerated, telescoped.
[00:52:43.319 --> 00:52:45.741]  Well, what happened in 50 years is happening in two years now.
[00:52:46.342 --> 00:52:48.003]  We are going under international regulation.
[00:52:48.023 --> 00:52:48.684]  I have a business.
[00:52:49.364 --> 00:52:52.547]  I get all the North American Union documents telling me I'm under their control.
[00:52:52.927 --> 00:52:54.088]  I show them to you on TV.
[00:52:54.108 --> 00:52:56.310]  Show them to you on the web.
[00:52:59.493 --> 00:53:00.033]  Oh, man.
[00:53:00.153 --> 00:53:06.158]  I'm going to play out the rest of this song and then we'll go back and say bye to We Are Change UK and Paul Watson.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:08.841]  The rest of this song is for you.
[00:53:25.478 --> 00:53:27.520]  I'll tell you what, cue up the Bandit.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.101]  Because that song's in it.
[00:53:29.121 --> 00:53:31.343]  I want to play a couple minutes of Smokey and the Bandit.
[00:53:31.363 --> 00:53:32.063]  John, you got that?
[00:53:33.004 --> 00:53:33.424]  I'll find it.
[00:53:33.844 --> 00:53:35.386]  Yeah, tell me when you get that cued up.
[00:53:35.426 --> 00:53:39.429]  And as we say bye to them, we'll go out with Smokey and the Bandit.
[00:53:39.749 --> 00:53:40.730]  You were on vacation, John.
[00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:42.831]  That was sent up last week and on Monday.
[00:53:43.352 --> 00:53:47.235]  Going back to We Are Change Ireland, anything else you guys want to add?
[00:53:47.255 --> 00:53:52.299]  Anybody else from We Are Change Ireland there who wants to jump on the phone and talk to us worldwide right now?
[00:53:53.021 --> 00:53:54.622]  No problem, Alex.
[00:53:54.642 --> 00:53:55.482]  Here's Johnny, over.
[00:53:56.203 --> 00:53:57.203]  Hey, Alex.
[00:53:57.243 --> 00:53:59.405]  It's been a very hard few months there.
[00:53:59.785 --> 00:54:09.590]  I just want to say thanks to all the groups and all the activists, and especially thanks to yourself and other We Are Change groups for giving me the inspiration to do what I'm doing.
[00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:16.034]  And also thanks to the people who have listened to us, because it really takes two people to tell the truth, the speaker and the listener, you know?
[00:54:16.354 --> 00:54:17.054]  The song's right.
[00:54:17.074 --> 00:54:18.315]  I just want to say thanks very much.
[00:54:19.955 --> 00:54:21.957]  Well, my friend, I just want to thank all of you.
[00:54:21.977 --> 00:54:26.042]  Anybody else there from We Are Change UK, Tip of the Spear, defeating the Lisbon Treaty?
[00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:28.385]  No one else here, Alex.
[00:54:28.425 --> 00:54:29.987]  Just everybody you've spoken to.
[00:54:30.007 --> 00:54:30.567]  That's about it.
[00:54:32.009 --> 00:54:32.770]  Alright, gentlemen.
[00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:33.551]  Thank you so much.
[00:54:33.591 --> 00:54:37.976]  I'll check in with you next week as this unfolds, and I appreciate you coming on with us.
[00:54:38.803 --> 00:54:44.628]  No problem Alex, have a pint of Guinness on us!
[00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:52.094]  Well, they say you can't fight City Hall.
[00:54:52.274 --> 00:54:56.217]  The media tells us we can't make a difference.
[00:54:56.797 --> 00:55:01.241]  Here's an example of a small group of committed individuals who have picked a topic.
[00:55:01.641 --> 00:55:04.384]  It was a close vote, despite the vote fraud.
[00:55:04.964 --> 00:55:07.346]  And the few percentage points that won it,
[00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:11.902]  The sovereignty could have been the thousands of people that they woke up to.
[00:55:11.922 --> 00:55:14.128]  You can fight City Hall, you can make a difference.
[00:55:15.535 --> 00:55:29.879]  You've got continual reporting at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com as all of this unfolds with the Lisbon Treaty as the enemy regroups and comes in with a bureaucratic implementation by stealth as the North American Union documents state.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:34.921]  Just absolutely historical things that we see unfolding here.
[00:55:35.241 --> 00:55:41.883]  We are the people, we have the will of the people, we have common sense, we have due process, the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[00:55:42.644 --> 00:55:50.443]  The organic law, we're the good guys, the government is owned by foreign corporations that are playing God and trying to piratically seize our society.
[00:55:50.783 --> 00:55:51.866]  Paul Watson, God bless you.
[00:55:52.637 --> 00:55:53.117]  Thanks Alex.
[00:55:53.638 --> 00:55:54.058]  You bet.
[00:55:54.458 --> 00:55:58.321]  I'm going to go ahead now as we get our next guest lined up and play Smokey and the Bandit.
[00:55:58.361 --> 00:56:09.449]  This was our theme song when we were out on the road in Bilderberg being followed by secret police, being chased, being surveilled and I think this song says it all ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:09.469 --> 00:56:12.211]  We are the Rag Tag and we are going to win with God's help.
[00:56:12.232 --> 00:56:12.612]  Here it is.
[00:56:24.787 --> 00:56:27.193]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[00:56:27.954 --> 00:56:33.507]  We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.
[00:56:56.409 --> 00:57:01.131]  We're going to do what they say can't be done.
[00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:04.913]  And it's show time to get down.
[00:57:04.973 --> 00:57:06.774]  Just watch old Bandit run.
[00:57:07.054 --> 00:57:07.954]  We're on the side of right.
[00:57:08.054 --> 00:57:09.315]  We're going to win.
[00:57:09.555 --> 00:57:10.695]  We're never going to stop.
[00:57:11.055 --> 00:57:11.976]  We're never going to back down.
[00:57:11.996 --> 00:57:12.636]  We're committed.
[00:57:13.016 --> 00:57:14.097]  Whatever you do to us.
[00:57:14.437 --> 00:57:15.457]  Whatever you try.
[00:57:15.737 --> 00:57:16.798]  We've got the initiative.
[00:57:17.038 --> 00:57:18.018]  We've got the focus.
[00:57:18.298 --> 00:57:19.219]  We've got the will.
[00:57:19.699 --> 00:57:20.159]  Tyrants.
[00:57:20.639 --> 00:57:23.581]  And I'm telling everybody who's been on the fence, choose sides now.
[00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:25.882]  Get on our team now!
[00:57:26.302 --> 00:57:29.123]  Come in for the big win against the New World Order!
[00:57:29.563 --> 00:57:29.843]  Woo!
[00:57:30.003 --> 00:57:30.743]  I love it!
[00:57:31.143 --> 00:57:32.144]  I'm so excited!
[00:57:32.164 --> 00:57:34.064]  They shot down the Lipset Treaty!
[00:57:34.385 --> 00:57:34.745]  Woo!
[00:57:34.845 --> 00:57:35.425]  Yeah!
[00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:39.286]  And now they're gonna try to bring it in through tyranny and show everybody who they are!
[00:57:39.526 --> 00:57:41.387]  This song's for you, UK!
[00:57:41.607 --> 00:57:42.967]  This song's for you, Ireland!
[00:57:43.208 --> 00:57:45.828]  This song's for all of you fighting the North American Union!
[00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:49.710]  Old Smokey's got his ears on and he's hot on our trail!
[00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:52.351]  Yeah, we're gonna beat him, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:52.391 --> 00:57:52.831]  Here it is.
[00:57:58.767 --> 00:58:01.129]  We're gonna do what they say can't be done.
[00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:06.154]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[00:58:06.594 --> 00:58:08.736]  I mean, he's found a white old bandit run.
[00:58:08.856 --> 00:58:12.379]  Old Smokey's got them ears on.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.881]  He's not on your trail.
[00:58:14.021 --> 00:58:16.783]  He ain't gonna rest until you're in jail.
[00:58:16.983 --> 00:58:20.246]  So you've got to dodge him, you've got to duck him.
[00:58:20.286 --> 00:58:21.788]  You've got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:32.638]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[00:58:50.521 --> 00:58:51.522]  Don't touch the brakes.
[00:58:52.323 --> 00:58:55.225]  Just drop that hammer down and go all the way.
[00:58:55.926 --> 00:58:56.967]  Be part of history, folks.
[00:58:56.987 --> 00:58:57.868]  You're only alive once.
[00:58:57.888 --> 00:58:58.548]  This is history.
[00:58:59.089 --> 00:59:00.971]  Are you part of the fight against the New World Order?
[00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:02.172]  Are you coming in for the big win?
[00:59:03.393 --> 00:59:04.774]  That's a question you gotta ask yourselves.
[00:59:04.794 --> 00:59:05.915]  This is life and death.
[00:59:06.436 --> 00:59:07.757]  The enemy's giving us no quarter.
[00:59:08.357 --> 00:59:10.379]  We are kicking their butt every time we take the field.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:12.101]  But most of us don't take the field.
[00:59:13.874 --> 00:59:20.215]  Most of you don't know the historical things that are happening, the things that are going on around you, and just how amazing they are.
[00:59:20.275 --> 00:59:21.195]  Do we have our next guest?
[00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:22.436]  She's all set.
[00:59:23.136 --> 00:59:28.017]  Folks, this is a perfect time to have this guest on, the next 20 minutes, and I want to have her back up for a couple hours in the near future.
[00:59:28.297 --> 00:59:33.277]  They've got the site, the organization, the group that really understands what's happening with the vaccines, the eugenics program.
[00:59:34.098 --> 00:59:41.179]  In 2000, Congressman Dan Burton sent in federal investigators with a congressional subpoena, seized documents from the CDC.
[00:59:42.219 --> 00:59:48.384]  The EPA, the FDA, and in their own documents they admitted that millions have been brain damaged by mercury in the vaccines.
[00:59:48.884 --> 00:59:50.886]  Then the media lied and said there was no mercury in it.
[00:59:50.926 --> 00:59:56.871]  Now they've had to admit it's in there, they've had to admit, federal courts have admitted, doctors, a blue ribbon panel had to admit it caused brain damage.
[00:59:57.191 --> 00:59:57.952]  We've been right again.
[00:59:58.873 --> 01:00:00.134]  Now Charlie Sheen, my friend,
[01:00:02.674 --> 01:00:06.937]  And his ex-wife, he's been to court, he's been fighting her, trying to keep her from vaccinating his children.
[01:00:07.977 --> 01:00:10.079]  The news is demonizing him, attacking him.
[01:00:10.359 --> 01:00:13.381]  They put a crazy looking picture of him up on the web on TMZ yesterday.
[01:00:13.801 --> 01:00:17.003]  Charlie Sheen tells Denise Richards, don't stick my kids.
[01:00:17.703 --> 01:00:21.026]  And there's the article for folks watching on PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:00:21.929 --> 01:00:24.271]  And it says, Charlie Sheen thinks vaccinations are poison.
[01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.172]  He doesn't think, he knows.
[01:00:25.492 --> 01:00:27.754]  This guy's obsessed with researching things, that's all he does.
[01:00:28.434 --> 01:00:30.356]  He does like ten hours a day, it's incredible.
[01:00:30.396 --> 01:00:34.719]  The guy doesn't party, doesn't play around, he drinks black coffee and studies the New World Order.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.201]  I got a chance to meet his mother a couple times.
[01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.443]  They've known all about it their whole life.
[01:00:39.923 --> 01:00:40.484]  Great people.
[01:00:41.264 --> 01:00:44.767]  Uh, so do a lot of other celebrities, including Jenny McCarthy and her boyfriend Jim Carrey.
[01:00:45.428 --> 01:00:52.835]  But, uh, his ex-wife Denise Richards apparently thinks that both reality TV shows and vaccinations are safe for kids, so naturally there's a big battle brewing.
[01:00:53.095 --> 01:00:58.460]  TMZ reports that Sheen sent a legal letter to the girl's physician stating the lack of consent for doctors to treat the daughters.
[01:00:59.261 --> 01:01:03.264]  And then they go into the media demonizing him for doing something that he's been proven right.
[01:01:03.924 --> 01:01:08.887]  I want to now bring you Barbara Lowe Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center.
[01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:10.248]  We'll give you out the website.
[01:01:10.588 --> 01:01:12.049]  But you got about 20 minutes, ma'am.
[01:01:12.249 --> 01:01:12.990]  We appreciate you.
[01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:16.432]  Break down the group, what we're facing, what's in the vaccines.
[01:01:16.512 --> 01:01:22.215]  And there is no law we've got to take them, though New Jersey and New York are trying to pass laws to do that right now.
[01:01:22.656 --> 01:01:23.136]  You're on the air.
[01:01:23.676 --> 01:01:41.251]  Okay, well I've been doing this for 26 years, fighting this fight to inform the public about the truth about vaccination, the risks associated with vaccination, and fighting for the freedom in this country to be able to choose which vaccines we want to use or not use any vaccines.
[01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:48.777]  In other words, I think it is a human right to be able to choose, to decide what you're willing to risk your life or your child's life for.
[01:01:49.418 --> 01:01:51.720]  Vaccines carry a risk of injury or death.
[01:01:52.762 --> 01:01:54.624]  That risk can be greater for some than others.
[01:01:55.284 --> 01:02:03.791]  But, over the last 25 years, we've seen the government recommend twice as many vaccines, and three times as many doses of vaccines.
[01:02:03.811 --> 01:02:10.856]  They're up to 50-something now, and if people would have listened to you and the medical doctors who warned 25 years ago, we wouldn't have millions and millions of autistic children.
[01:02:11.556 --> 01:02:12.177]  Absolutely.
[01:02:12.257 --> 01:02:21.524]  We warned back in the 1980s about DPT vaccine that was brain-damaging children, and Congress finally said, wait a minute, we can't have all these lawsuits, we're going to have to pass a law
[01:02:22.068 --> 01:02:29.571]  And they did in 1986, protecting the manufacturers and the doctors from liability because the truth was getting out and people were going to court.
[01:02:29.931 --> 01:02:33.272]  And they said, and the vaccine manufacturers said, we're going to leave this country without any vaccine.
[01:02:33.632 --> 01:02:35.393]  So the government says, we're going to protect you.
[01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:39.314]  Well, since then, we have seen an addition of so many vaccines.
[01:02:39.354 --> 01:02:51.518]  In fact, with the CDC's latest recommendation of a flu shot for every child from six months through 18 years old, we're up to 69 doses of 16 vaccines the government recommends for our kids.
[01:02:51.914 --> 01:02:52.955]  Through age 18.
[01:02:53.435 --> 01:03:00.321]  And they simply have not done the scientific studies to prove that this kind of manipulation of the immune system is safe.
[01:03:00.842 --> 01:03:01.902]  Here's a microcosm.
[01:03:02.463 --> 01:03:07.727]  On their own Gardasil insert, go to Gardasil's website, Merck, folks brought you Vioxx and all the heart attacks.
[01:03:08.388 --> 01:03:13.812]  You go there and they say this probably doesn't even protect you, there's hundreds of strains, this only covers four to six.
[01:03:14.233 --> 01:03:18.797]  If you already have the virus as most Americans have, it gives you a 45% increase in actually getting cancer.
[01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:23.360]  But it doesn't matter, people think it's a cancer cure, they're out taking it.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:30.843]  Yeah, that's a vaccine, the newest vaccine, and they only studied that vaccine in fewer than 1,200 little girls under the age of 16.
[01:03:30.883 --> 01:03:33.364]  And there have been a bunch of deaths, and they still approved it.
[01:03:33.884 --> 01:03:36.586]  And they still approved it, and they targeted 11-year-old girls.
[01:03:36.606 --> 01:03:39.087]  They'd only studied it in about 100 11-year-old girls.
[01:03:39.127 --> 01:03:39.507]  Good God.
[01:03:40.027 --> 01:03:46.270]  The government said every little 11-year-old girl should take it, and Merck, within six months of licensure by the FDA,
[01:03:46.838 --> 01:03:54.203]  Went through all of the states trying to ram vaccine mandates so that all sixth grade girls would have to get it.
[01:03:54.363 --> 01:04:01.428]  And by getting Perry to sign on to it, it kicked in vaccine liability because they knew it was a dangerous vaccine.
[01:04:01.788 --> 01:04:05.331]  And so now the taxpayer pays for all the damage, but nobody ever hears about it.
[01:04:05.751 --> 01:04:11.635]  But we did organize a national effort, and parents went into their legislatures in the states
[01:04:12.017 --> 01:04:19.204]  And they oppose this vaccine being mandated, and for the first time in a quarter century, we beat back a government mandate.
[01:04:19.765 --> 01:04:23.809]  And so, what you said at the top of your show, of this segment, you are right.
[01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:31.537]  If people will stand up for their right to be free, to make these kinds of choices, they can make a difference.
[01:04:31.957 --> 01:04:35.741]  But they have to get out of being apathetic, and they have to stand up and be counted.
[01:04:36.787 --> 01:04:37.467]  Absolutely.
[01:04:37.527 --> 01:04:39.788]  This is all about setting precedence.
[01:04:39.828 --> 01:04:54.812]  Continue to break down the types of, I mean, they admit all these different types of cancer viruses found in vaccines, all the mercury, all the DNA fragments, all the toxins, all the different chemicals, the different funguses, the different bacteria.
[01:04:55.553 --> 01:04:59.574]  I mean, they forced the anthrax shot, later admitting that it killed a bunch of the troops.
[01:04:59.874 --> 01:05:03.175]  They forced smallpox shots, so they had to suspend it because it was killing so many people.
[01:05:03.955 --> 01:05:05.516]  But it always is in the back of the paper.
[01:05:05.576 --> 01:05:06.596]  I mean, this is a holocaust.
[01:05:07.817 --> 01:05:12.900]  No, the people just generally do not understand the components of vaccines.
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.841]  There's aluminum.
[01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:15.162]  Yes, there's mercury.
[01:05:15.202 --> 01:05:21.125]  They've taken mercury out of some of the vaccines, but they've left it in the flu vaccine, for example, that we're trying to give every kid.
[01:05:21.145 --> 01:05:22.867]  They're saying every kid has to get every year.
[01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:24.788]  There's phenoxyethanol.
[01:05:25.028 --> 01:05:30.952]  There's adventitious agent contamination with virus DNA from viruses and bacterias they can't screen for.
[01:05:31.905 --> 01:05:36.666]  There is, you know, plus lab-altered viruses and bacteria.
[01:05:37.807 --> 01:05:55.912]  So, you know, when you manipulate the immune system over and over again, typically by injecting into the body these components and these lab-altered viruses and bacteria, you have no idea what is going to happen, particularly if you are a person who has, for example, in the family, a history of autoimmunity-like.
[01:05:56.331 --> 01:06:06.737]  Thyroid disease or rheumatoid arthritis or asthma or severe allergies, which a lot of us have, that we may already be predisposed to kind of having a hypersensitive immune system.
[01:06:07.078 --> 01:06:23.228]  If you keep hitting a kid over and over again, sometimes with eight to ten vaccines on one day repeatedly, you are going to have a greater number of people who would ordinarily not have expressed that autoimmunity become brain and immune system damaged.
[01:06:23.548 --> 01:06:25.169]  Give out the website for your organization.
[01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:33.683]  We have, the website is www.nvic.org for National Vaccine Information Center.org.
[01:06:33.703 --> 01:06:37.204]  We also have a new website, standupbecounted.org.
[01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:49.510]  Okay, we're talking to the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, the biggest advocacy group for choice, for people having their right to not be medicated against their will, and to inform the public about what's happening.
[01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:51.391]  I don't normally get in Charlie Sheen's business.
[01:06:51.451 --> 01:06:52.332]  I'm good friends with him.
[01:06:53.072 --> 01:07:02.116]  And he, you know, privately in the past, before this was all public, even when she divorced him, she brought up these issues, saying he's crazy, he believes vaccines are dangerous.
[01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:11.740]  Meanwhile, Jenny McCarthy's on Oprah, it's all over the news, Larry King Live's admitting it, the government's admitting it, and then now she's attacking him and the media again, trying to medicate.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.502]  I think we're going to make a YouTube video of this and I'll send it to Charlie and he might give it to her.
[01:07:15.582 --> 01:07:17.103]  He's nicely tried to educate her.
[01:07:17.483 --> 01:07:18.224]  She needs to become educated.
[01:07:18.244 --> 01:07:18.884]  This is a very serious issue.
[01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:21.106]  I actually, many years ago, had a talk with Charlie Sheen about this.
[01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:24.009]  I tell you, Charlie is a freedom fighter.
[01:07:43.883 --> 01:07:48.685]  He's an incredible guy, and he is educated about this issue.
[01:07:49.045 --> 01:07:58.168]  She really needs to open up her eyes, take another look at it, and do it, because she needs to protect her children, just in case they may be at high risk for having vaccine reactions.
[01:07:58.208 --> 01:08:04.371]  But, I mean, how can she say he's crazy when he's given her the research and it's all over the news it's causing problems?
[01:08:05.731 --> 01:08:06.632]  You know, I don't know.
[01:08:06.772 --> 01:08:10.413]  I mean, I don't know that personal situation.
[01:08:10.473 --> 01:08:13.114]  I only know that Charlie has educated himself.
[01:08:13.601 --> 01:08:19.703]  He has done a lot of research, I agree with you, and he is very articulate about the subject.
[01:08:19.983 --> 01:08:32.507]  And I think that, you know, mothers and fathers, whether they're together in a marriage together or whether they're split up, they really need to take this issue seriously and not make it a battleground for who gets custody or whether one person is a better parent than another.
[01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.687]  This is serious stuff.
[01:08:34.168 --> 01:08:35.628]  These vaccines can impact
[01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:41.534]  on brain and immune system function, and everybody needs to get educated about it before they get one more vaccine.
[01:08:41.634 --> 01:08:50.378]  Well, they're also tied into autoimmune diseases causing cancers, and they found so many, not just SV40, but so many other cancer viruses in every major vaccine line.
[01:08:51.478 --> 01:08:56.420]  Well, you know, this is the situation with, for example, polio vaccine.
[01:08:57.121 --> 01:09:00.182]  A lot of people don't know that that vaccine was contaminated with
[01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:01.213]  I don't
[01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:28.823]  There is a potential HIV connection to the polio vaccine.
[01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:35.875]  Well, Dr. Salk has now admitted that the monkeys they used for the polio vaccine had been used in bioweapons tests in Africa.
[01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:43.059]  Yeah, that's the connection, is the experimental polio vaccine campaigns in Africa in the 1950s and 60s.
[01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:46.881]  And over 100 million Americans got inoculations from those batches.
[01:09:47.342 --> 01:09:47.702]  Correct.
[01:09:48.002 --> 01:09:49.223]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[01:09:49.523 --> 01:09:56.788]  Hey, sorry Denise, we just know the facts, your ex-husband knows the facts, and I'm tired of you picking on Charlie and being ignorant.
[01:09:57.608 --> 01:10:04.793]  And you've made this a public issue on your stupid reality show to torture him, and we're sick of it, so his friends are weighing in and telling you,
[01:10:05.828 --> 01:10:10.561]  Stop doing this to your children just to make fun of your husband who happens to know what's going on, your ex-husband.
[01:10:10.742 --> 01:10:11.744]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:10:14.358 --> 01:10:20.263]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?

[01:10:20.863 --> 01:10:21.504]  We'll be right back.
[01:10:21.764 --> 01:10:23.685]  Hey, sorry Denise, we just know the facts.
[01:10:24.025 --> 01:10:29.049]  Your ex-husband knows the facts, and I'm tired of you picking on Charlie and being ignorant.
[01:10:29.890 --> 01:10:42.840]  And you've made this a public issue on your stupid reality show to torture him, and we're sick of it, so his friends are weighing in and telling you, stop doing this to your children just to make fun of your husband who happens to know what's going on, your ex-husband.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:44.021]  We'll be right back with our guest.
[01:10:46.579 --> 01:10:52.467]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:10:52.567 --> 01:11:01.418]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch.

[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:05.280]  Here's the story.
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:13.445]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:11:13.745 --> 01:11:14.806]  And here's the best part.

[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.584]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[01:11:36.905 --> 01:11:39.908]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.

[01:11:46.542 --> 01:11:48.223]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:51.966]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:11:52.126 --> 01:11:53.988]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:11:54.008 --> 01:11:57.310]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:11:57.611 --> 01:12:03.095]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:12:03.355 --> 01:12:07.278]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:12:07.598 --> 01:12:12.519]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:12:12.799 --> 01:12:15.560]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:12:44.674 --> 01:12:45.414]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:51.886]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:12:52.086 --> 01:12:56.949]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:12:57.109 --> 01:13:03.033]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[01:13:03.273 --> 01:13:07.516]  We promote a common-sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[01:13:07.736 --> 01:13:14.981]  Published monthly since 1985, the Nationalist Times features outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[01:13:16.762 --> 01:13:19.565]  Ralph Nader is scheduled to be calling in in the next 10 minutes.
[01:13:19.866 --> 01:13:24.511]  Then Mark Dice being death-threaded on national radio by Michael Reagan.
[01:13:24.551 --> 01:13:29.417]  This serious, totally jam-packed Friday transmission here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:29.677 --> 01:13:31.199]  Lisbon Treaty going down in flames.
[01:13:31.599 --> 01:13:35.383]  EU swears to try to ram it through now through the bureaucracy illegally.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.281]  We are talking to Barbara Lowe Fisher.
[01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:43.022]  I didn't mean to bring Charlie Sheen into this, but the point is he's being attacked in national media right now.
[01:13:43.882 --> 01:13:45.303]  All the evidence is on his side.
[01:13:45.343 --> 01:13:47.223]  He told me he'd done hundreds of hours of research.
[01:13:48.604 --> 01:13:55.106]  And I was just talking to Barbara Lowe Fisher, and she said Charlie called her years ago and did an hour and a half research with her on the phone.
[01:13:55.526 --> 01:13:56.706]  I mean, that's an example.
[01:13:56.726 --> 01:13:58.007]  I didn't even know she knew Charlie.
[01:13:58.327 --> 01:14:04.689]  And here he is with another activist group, with scientists and doctors on their group, doing research, and then Denise does no research.
[01:14:05.129 --> 01:14:14.635]  Like so many other mothers and fathers out there who then just say we're... I mean, Barbara, they lied for years and said that we were lying that mercury was even in the vaccines.
[01:14:15.055 --> 01:14:16.757]  Or then they said mercury was good for you.
[01:14:16.777 --> 01:14:18.798]  In fact, John, cue that mercury good for you clip up.
[01:14:19.078 --> 01:14:30.786]  Your comments on the amount of deception they put out and then now all over the country at the start of the school year they announce it's the law, come to the courthouse, come to the sports stadium, be inoculated or you'll be arrested and there's no law.
[01:14:30.826 --> 01:14:32.427]  Then you've got that mass fraud.
[01:14:32.487 --> 01:14:34.268]  I mean, this is so incredible, Barbara.
[01:14:36.032 --> 01:14:36.972]  That's what they're trying to do in New York.
[01:14:36.992 --> 01:14:41.613]  They're trying to ram through legislation that would make the CDC a de facto lawmaking body.
[01:14:41.653 --> 01:14:47.934]  That every time the CDC recommends a new vaccine, it will be automatically added to the state laws in New York.
[01:14:48.054 --> 01:14:49.454]  And they want to do this in every state.
[01:14:49.514 --> 01:15:00.116]  And they're even going so far as to say every new vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease, like HPV or Hepatitis B, would be given to children without their parents' permission.
[01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:03.517]  Now they're really, really going beyond the line.
[01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:08.661]  And I think that people don't realize that these laws get passed and they never even know about it.
[01:15:09.261 --> 01:15:23.068]  And they need to get on our website, they need to sign up for the vaccine e-news I put out every week that alerts people about paying attention to what's happening in their state because they're going to wake up one day and they're not going to be able to say no to that.
[01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:30.366]  There are hundreds of vaccines in more than 2,000 clinical trials around the world that are being created by Big Pharma.
[01:15:30.746 --> 01:15:34.029]  And then Big Pharma comes in and makes your government make you take it.
[01:15:34.249 --> 01:15:40.333]  Let's play this local CBS clip at the similar news copy was read all over the country saying mercury is actually good for your brain.
[01:15:40.553 --> 01:15:40.954]  Here it is.
[01:15:41.738 --> 01:15:47.744]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:15:48.185 --> 01:15:54.631]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:15:55.092 --> 01:16:02.019]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:16:02.219 --> 01:16:08.183]  But if you read the study it just claimed, it wasn't even related to that, it was pure deception.
[01:16:08.243 --> 01:16:14.367]  Up on the screen I have TMZ with a crazy looking screenshot of Charlie like he's bad.
[01:16:14.387 --> 01:16:16.428]  I mean this is so insane.
[01:16:16.468 --> 01:16:18.209]  Give out the organization's website again.
[01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:30.457]  www.nvic.org or standupbecounted.org In the minute we've got left, any other key points that need to be added, Barbara?
[01:16:30.905 --> 01:16:33.948]  Well, on the mercury issue, I mean, it kills brain cells.
[01:16:34.428 --> 01:16:38.251]  Aluminum that's in vaccines is also known to kill brain cells.
[01:16:38.832 --> 01:16:41.014]  I mean, that's just known in the medical literature.
[01:16:41.234 --> 01:16:45.578]  So for someone to stand up and say that mercury is good for you is just ridiculous.
[01:16:46.398 --> 01:16:51.102]  You know, people need to get educated about these vaccines and not assume they're like taking a drink of water.
[01:16:51.403 --> 01:16:55.346]  You know, they have profound effects on brain and immune function.
[01:16:56.059 --> 01:16:59.101]  And so they need to get educated, and then make an informed decision.
[01:16:59.401 --> 01:17:04.343]  Well, in the past, when they only wanted to take a few dozen vaccines, they could buffalo people and lie and say they had to take it.
[01:17:04.383 --> 01:17:16.229]  Now that it's 60-plus shots, and then it'll be 100 the next year, as you said, the people are finally saying no, so now the government's trying to come in with actual laws to forcibly medicate people with deadly poisons.
[01:17:16.749 --> 01:17:18.990]  And we just salute you and your organization.
[01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:22.152]  I would imagine, is your group growing like never before?
[01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:26.914]  Oh, well, our website is getting more than a million hits now a year.
[01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:27.735]  I mean, we're good.
[01:17:27.775 --> 01:17:28.335]  We're growing.
[01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:28.595]  Yeah.
[01:17:28.715 --> 01:17:37.019]  A lot of people, if you go on Google search and Google a vaccine copy, like vaccine information, we come up number one or two, our website and the blog that I have.
[01:17:37.469 --> 01:17:41.312]  So, I would really encourage people to not stick their heads in the sand.
[01:17:41.612 --> 01:17:43.574]  Don't believe everything your doctor tells you.
[01:17:43.854 --> 01:17:45.115]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:17:45.616 --> 01:17:46.977]  Stand up for your rights.
[01:17:47.437 --> 01:17:49.299]  Alright.
[01:17:49.419 --> 01:17:51.861]  Barbara Lowe Fisher, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.485]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:17:58.866 --> 01:18:01.068]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:18:02.998 --> 01:18:03.358]  All right.
[01:18:03.418 --> 01:18:04.239]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:27.791 --> 01:18:31.172]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:18:31.192 --> 01:18:34.693]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:38.194]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.334]  A new world order.
[01:18:41.035 --> 01:18:45.076]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:18:45.176 --> 01:18:48.757]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:18:48.777 --> 01:18:51.017]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:18:51.557 --> 01:18:53.958]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:18:54.731 --> 01:19:02.237]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:05.099 --> 01:19:10.083]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:10.543 --> 01:19:14.005]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:14.406 --> 01:19:16.908]  Build-a-Burg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:19:16.968 --> 01:19:18.128]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:18.148 --> 01:19:18.909]  They're not after money.
[01:19:18.929 --> 01:19:20.010]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:20.951]  They're after power.
[01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:22.051]  That's their after-museum.
[01:19:22.352 --> 01:19:22.552]  Order.
[01:19:23.357 --> 01:19:24.157]  You want answers?
[01:19:24.938 --> 01:19:25.818]  Well, so does he.
[01:19:26.498 --> 01:19:30.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.802]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:19:40.564 --> 01:19:48.007]  Well, for the next 20 minutes, we have presidential candidate running as an independent, not as a Green this time, Ralph Nader.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:55.204]  Famous anti-corruption consumer advocate and he is with us now running for president.
[01:19:56.185 --> 01:20:03.990]  The Democrats could argue that it was bad for him to run as a Green and maybe it made Al Gore lose or this or that or some other candidate.
[01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:10.234]  But in the final equation now, what difference is there with Barack Obama and John McCain?
[01:20:10.274 --> 01:20:17.399]  And we'll ask Ralph Nader his take on that, talk about his campaign and what his party platform is running as an independent.
[01:20:17.739 --> 01:20:19.340]  Mr. Nader, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:20:20.221 --> 01:20:20.821]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:20:20.922 --> 01:20:21.682]  Thank you, listeners.
[01:20:22.603 --> 01:20:26.147]  What's most important for my listeners to know, and why are you running for president?
[01:20:27.568 --> 01:20:35.576]  Well, we need someone who has stood for the people and not for big business and their government minions in Washington, and it's quite clear after
[01:20:36.147 --> 01:20:40.270]  Working here for so many years that every department agency in Washington, D.C.
[01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:42.891]  is overwhelmingly controlled by corporate power.
[01:20:43.292 --> 01:20:47.454]  The big banks and financial institutions control the Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
[01:20:47.895 --> 01:20:52.778]  The big defense manufacturers control the Department of Defense more than the people.
[01:20:53.198 --> 01:20:56.259]  There's not much left for people to decide anymore, Alec.
[01:20:56.399 --> 01:20:57.379]  Not much left at all.
[01:20:57.819 --> 01:21:05.161]  The Constitution still starts with we the people, but the way the judges are reading it, it sounds more like we the corporation.
[01:21:05.381 --> 01:21:12.622]  On our website, votenator.org, and I really urge you to connect with that vibrant website from time to time, folks.
[01:21:13.122 --> 01:21:21.404]  And also, regardless of where you're going to vote, or who you're going to vote for, log into our email at votenator.org, and you'll get regular
[01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:29.537]  Uh, missives and announcements give you a different take than the mainstream media does on the presidential campaign.
[01:21:30.137 --> 01:21:37.385]  The thing is this, people who believe the taxpayer dollar is a sacred trust
[01:21:37.925 --> 01:21:40.827]  have got to challenge the waste in Washington.
[01:21:41.167 --> 01:21:49.411]  And the biggest waste is in that bloated, wasteful military budget that now takes one half of the federal government's complete operating expenditures.
[01:21:49.651 --> 01:21:50.872]  And there's no more Soviet Union.
[01:21:51.392 --> 01:22:05.540]  So, it's obviously a huge contract bonanza for these big defense companies whose lobbies swarm over Washington, whose political action committees cash register politics, and whose executives go into the Pentagon
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:10.343]  Telling generals and admirals what they can do at the top.
[01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:21.073]  Mr. Nader, I want to go back to what you first said, describing how global corporations have come in and taken over the decision-making process of government to where government is just their vehicle.
[01:22:21.453 --> 01:22:23.555]  How would you describe that system?
[01:22:23.595 --> 01:22:24.416]  Is that fascism?
[01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:29.000]  Yeah, well, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said it in 1938 in a message to Congress.
[01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.203]  He said, when our government is taken over by private economic power, that's fascism.
[01:22:34.223 --> 01:22:36.245]  He used that exact words, Alex.
[01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:38.967]  And of course, it's never been worse.
[01:22:39.347 --> 01:22:40.848]  What do you hope to do with this campaign?
[01:22:41.929 --> 01:22:43.430]  Well, look what we've got to do.
[01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:47.112]  First of all, these global trade agreements are more than trade agreements.
[01:22:47.152 --> 01:22:50.895]  They basically allow communist and fascist dictators abroad
[01:22:51.711 --> 01:22:59.492]  Who receive the global corporations, jobs and industries, and pummel their workers down to 20, 30, 40 cents an hour, etc.
[01:22:59.992 --> 01:23:05.413]  They allow these fascist and communist regimes to pull down the standard of living for the American worker.
[01:23:06.234 --> 01:23:09.114]  That's what the whole point of NAFTA and WTO are.
[01:23:09.614 --> 01:23:16.555]  It's to open up very low-cost areas abroad, and these are dictatorially repressed costs.
[01:23:16.595 --> 01:23:20.056]  They are not market costs in places like China.
[01:23:20.718 --> 01:23:24.220]  And so they say, okay, we're open for business.
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:39.049]  So, you know, General Electric, General Motors, all these companies move their industries, lay off their workers, hollow communities in downtown USA, around the country, the electronics industry, the auto supply industry, you know, they're all moving over there.
[01:23:39.617 --> 01:23:47.624]  And then they use this hard-working Chinese labor at 30, 40, 50 cents an hour with modern capital equipment and ship the products back to the U.S.
[01:23:48.185 --> 01:23:54.231]  And in the meantime, workers and companies playing by the rules here can't compete.
[01:23:54.631 --> 01:24:01.017]  And not only that, but a lot of the food you're getting, especially farm-bred fish, for example, from China, is contaminated.
[01:24:01.477 --> 01:24:02.518]  Yes sir, got a break, got a break.
[01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.800]  We're going to continue talking on the internet side.
[01:24:19.008 --> 01:24:19.488]  Mr. Nader?
[01:24:19.869 --> 01:24:21.009]  Yeah?
[01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:36.020]  Just to explain, we're on the AM and FM dial in three minutes, but on the internet, I don't want to waste any time, so with the huge internet and TV audience we have right now, I want to continue talking during this three minute break, but let's come back to that other subject when we return.
[01:24:37.521 --> 01:24:43.045]  Right now, give out some of the websites, tell people about the campaign, and then some more of the basics of your platform.
[01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:54.429]  Alright, the website is votenator.org, or votenator.org, and we've got the issues that are on the table for Nader Gonzales off the table for Obama-McCain.
[01:24:54.469 --> 01:24:56.350]  We want to open up the presidential debates.
[01:24:56.910 --> 01:25:04.331]  It's a corporation, this Commission on Presidential Debates, created by the Republican-Democratic Party, and they decide who gets on and who doesn't get on.
[01:25:04.371 --> 01:25:07.072]  They decide which reporters are chosen for the questions.
[01:25:07.092 --> 01:25:08.172]  I mean, the whole thing's a farce.
[01:25:08.572 --> 01:25:10.533]  And then they have it funded by corporate lobbies.
[01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:11.893]  We want to have a
[01:25:12.543 --> 01:25:20.446]  We want to tax things we like the least as a society or dislike the most before we tax workers and before we tax the necessities of life.
[01:25:20.926 --> 01:25:25.148]  So, massive speculation in Wall Street, it's not taxed.
[01:25:25.248 --> 01:25:28.930]  You buy something in the store, you get a 5, 6, 7 percent sales tax.
[01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:29.570]  Someone buys
[01:25:30.146 --> 01:25:34.167]  A hundred million dollars of GM derivatives, and there's no tax.
[01:25:34.508 --> 01:25:42.210]  And when these Wall Street crooks get these giant investment banks into trouble, they go to Washington for a bailout on the back of the taxpayers.
[01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:58.236]  So, if we have a tiny tax on speculation and securities, since $500 trillion have been negotiated, will be this year, you can imagine how much money that will raise and depress, somewhat, this speculative fervor that's driving up
[01:25:58.898 --> 01:26:03.482]  Uh, energy prices and your gasoline, uh, at your gas pump.
[01:26:03.502 --> 01:26:04.543]  We want to reverse U.S.
[01:26:04.603 --> 01:26:05.664]  policy in the Middle East.
[01:26:06.124 --> 01:26:14.591]  You side with the peace movement in Israel and Palestine, not with the war, uh, militaristic efforts the way, uh, Bush and Clinton and others have done.
[01:26:14.611 --> 01:26:17.313]  Uh, we want to impeach Bush and Cheney.
[01:26:17.834 --> 01:26:21.697]  Uh, these are the most impeachable, uh, President and Vice President in American history.
[01:26:22.233 --> 01:26:27.797]  And it's good that Dennis Kucinich has spent about three hours on the House floor making the case.
[01:26:27.837 --> 01:26:28.637]  Let me stop you there.
[01:26:28.677 --> 01:26:30.199]  We're about to come back to the full audience.
[01:26:30.239 --> 01:26:32.560]  That was my next question when we got back to the main audience.
[01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:36.403]  Let's get directly into impeachment and those 35 articles.
[01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:48.391]  Let's get into your campaign and then more about this kind of modern globalist mercantilism that is completely destroying really any future economic viability into this nation.
[01:26:48.431 --> 01:26:51.173]  But before we come back in 20 seconds, give out your website again.
[01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:54.203]  The website is votenator.org.
[01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:59.248]  You want to make a monetary donation, a contribution, by all means, whatever you can afford.
[01:26:59.268 --> 01:27:02.811]  The legal limit is $4,600.
[01:27:03.472 --> 01:27:08.757]  And we're not getting any money from commercial interests or PACs, so we rely on folks like you.
[01:27:08.998 --> 01:27:09.838]  We're going live right now.
[01:27:09.879 --> 01:27:11.260]  We're going live to the Bain audience right now.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:11.800]  Final segment.
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:12.081]  Here we go.
[01:27:14.306 --> 01:27:22.009]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:27:22.929 --> 01:27:27.170]  The PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and listeners of the InfoWars.com streams.
[01:27:27.190 --> 01:27:29.571]  We've just got a behind-the-scenes for three minutes with Ralph Nader.
[01:27:29.771 --> 01:27:33.072]  This is our main final segment with him for the next 15 minutes right now.
[01:27:33.593 --> 01:27:36.994]  Sir Dennis Kucinich, who I know you agree with on a lot of policies,
[01:27:38.135 --> 01:27:42.439]  He has successfully defeated a corporate attack on getting back into Congress.
[01:27:42.979 --> 01:27:46.022]  He now introduced 35 articles of impeachment, as you know.
[01:27:46.042 --> 01:27:48.525]  A. What do you think of those 35 articles?
[01:27:48.605 --> 01:27:51.268]  B. Are you in support of the impeachment?
[01:27:51.328 --> 01:27:55.312]  And what can we do to try to support him in that?
[01:27:56.584 --> 01:28:13.513]  Well, not only am I supportive, but about three weeks ago I stood in front of the White House with the terrorists milling around and made a 45-minute case for the impeachment of Bush, Cheney, or their resignation, the way Nixon and Agnew had to resign, or their subsequent prosecution once they leave office.
[01:28:13.953 --> 01:28:21.057]  I mean, there are at least five serious, repeated, daily high crimes and misdemeanors, as our Constitution puts it, for impeachment.
[01:28:21.517 --> 01:28:28.719]  One is a criminal war of aggression against Iraq based on a platform of lies, deceptions, and cover-ups that have been hugely documented.
[01:28:29.179 --> 01:28:32.320]  The second is systemic torture that violates the U.S.
[01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:36.781]  Army Field Manual, federal statutes, our Constitution, and the Geneva Conventions.
[01:28:36.841 --> 01:28:45.503]  The third is arresting thousands of Americans and throwing them in jail without preferring charges and allowing them to have attorneys.
[01:28:49.716 --> 01:28:49.936]  I think?
[01:29:07.535 --> 01:29:16.699]  Uh, has had 800 signing statements, signing bills enacted by Congress, and he basically says, I'll decide whether or not I'm going to obey them.
[01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:22.402]  And that's more signing statements than all the presidents from George Washington to Clinton put together.
[01:29:22.682 --> 01:29:33.867]  So all five, and they go on every day, they're not like Alex, not like, you know, a one-time Watergate situation, not like lying under oath about sex involving Clinton, for which he was impeached.
[01:29:34.428 --> 01:29:37.077]  And I think we should all support Dennis Kucinich.
[01:29:37.097 --> 01:29:41.110]  You notice that the mainstream media has pretty much blacked him out, and here he is.
[01:29:41.904 --> 01:29:50.067]  Uh, a upstanding member of the House, right on the House floor, and, uh, they got reporters all over the place, and suddenly they put away their pens, huh?
[01:29:50.507 --> 01:30:01.610]  So, uh, it is important to get, uh, Chairman John Conyers and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, uh, to hold this President and Vice President accountable for their high crimes and misdemeanors.
[01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:06.112]  You know, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, put it very well the other day.
[01:30:07.352 --> 01:30:09.873]  We tried a monarchy once, but it didn't work.
[01:30:10.393 --> 01:30:14.354]  By the way, Alex, just to finish, I was up in Kennebunkport, where the Bushes have their palatial estate.
[01:30:26.939 --> 01:30:32.665]  I made the same point on impeachment, and that's up on our website, votenator.org.
[01:30:32.705 --> 01:30:42.193]  Anybody who wants to see that statement across the cove from the Bush family compound can look up votenator.org.
[01:30:42.273 --> 01:30:43.554]  It's been getting a lot of attention.
[01:30:43.574 --> 01:30:45.696]  Mr. Nader, I've got to ask you a list of questions here.
[01:30:45.776 --> 01:30:51.762]  First off, you've been around a long time, you've seen a lot of corruption, one of the foremost corruption fighters out there, and we support you in that.
[01:30:52.282 --> 01:30:57.925]  But in your life studying this and seeing different personalities, here's just one small tiny example.
[01:30:58.945 --> 01:31:00.926]  You have John McCain goes over to England.
[01:31:00.946 --> 01:31:03.348]  He has hundreds of donors to a campaign dinner.
[01:31:03.828 --> 01:31:04.668]  None of them are U.S.
[01:31:04.688 --> 01:31:05.129]  citizens.
[01:31:05.169 --> 01:31:06.469]  They admit it's all felonies.
[01:31:06.749 --> 01:31:09.271]  The London Guardian and AP report on it, but no other press.
[01:31:09.571 --> 01:31:12.532]  And John McCain just says, I don't care, I'll commit crimes if I want to.
[01:31:12.992 --> 01:31:17.555]  We have the White House memos with Gonzales and Yu saying they can torture children with pliers.
[01:31:18.115 --> 01:31:19.175]  I mean, what has happened?
[01:31:19.576 --> 01:31:20.736]  It's more than just corruption.
[01:31:20.776 --> 01:31:22.316]  It's like insanity.
[01:31:22.377 --> 01:31:24.817]  Like, they're trying to break every rule.
[01:31:24.837 --> 01:31:25.418]  They're trying.
[01:31:25.658 --> 01:31:27.958]  Even the Nazis didn't admit they tortured people.
[01:31:28.279 --> 01:31:29.239]  They just did it in secret.
[01:31:29.259 --> 01:31:30.999]  I mean, the mindset of these people.
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.440]  I'm worried they may stage a vent.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:35.441]  They may start another war with Iran.
[01:31:35.741 --> 01:31:37.202]  I mean, they're building FEMA camps.
[01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:38.542]  That's now in the newspapers.
[01:31:39.022 --> 01:31:40.863]  They're setting up private death squads.
[01:31:41.563 --> 01:31:44.304]  I mean, can you just speak to what we've seen?
[01:31:44.904 --> 01:31:46.845]  I mean, not just the articles of impeachment, but just the
[01:31:47.185 --> 01:31:52.969]  The total lawlessness and why you think they're doing it, because there's got to be some method to this, or is it just total megalomania?
[01:31:53.649 --> 01:31:55.150]  Lawlessness is the right word.
[01:31:55.170 --> 01:31:56.791]  This is an outlaw presidency.
[01:31:56.811 --> 01:32:00.274]  This is a president who thinks he's above the law, beyond the law.
[01:32:00.334 --> 01:32:01.955]  He can do anything he wants.
[01:32:01.995 --> 01:32:04.797]  He can arrest and throw in prison anybody he wants.
[01:32:04.857 --> 01:32:09.860]  He can invade and attack any country in the world that he wants, and he's effectively said that.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.083]  And he can violate any constitutional provision or federal law that he wants.
[01:32:14.123 --> 01:32:15.644]  Now, how does he get away with it?
[01:32:15.965 --> 01:32:18.226]  Because there's no opposition party to speak of.
[01:32:18.286 --> 01:32:21.729]  The Democratic Party have just lain down on the job.
[01:32:21.949 --> 01:32:25.132]  They control Congress, but they refuse to have impeachment hearings.
[01:32:25.152 --> 01:32:31.697]  They even refuse to have hearings on the constitutional and statutory crimes of the Bush-Cheney regime.
[01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:43.833]  And I notice a real tone of urgency in your voice, Alec, and it's well merited because this is a subversion of everything our founding fathers ever dreamed of for our country.
[01:32:44.719 --> 01:32:46.701]  And we've got to do something about it.
[01:32:46.741 --> 01:32:55.628]  We've got to contact our senators and representatives, and when they come home in August, I mean, surround their auditoriums with protesters and say, you've got to do something.
[01:32:55.648 --> 01:32:58.651]  Don't tell us that it's only six months left in the regime.
[01:32:58.671 --> 01:33:01.273]  And then the police show up and say, no protest allowed.
[01:33:01.893 --> 01:33:04.796]  Activists being arrested everywhere, building more prisons everywhere.
[01:33:04.816 --> 01:33:08.959]  I mean, it looks like this regime, backed up by the corporations, is going for broke.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.601]  What do you think their endgame is?
[01:33:11.946 --> 01:33:15.826]  Well, I mean, their endgame is basically corporate fascism.
[01:33:16.637 --> 01:33:23.399]  That's what it is, the merger of government and big business for criminal purposes.
[01:33:23.539 --> 01:33:35.643]  And you'll notice that on our website, one of the issues on our table there, off the table for Obama and McCain, is an aggressive crackdown on corporate crime and corporate subsidies of the taxpayer dollar.
[01:33:36.003 --> 01:33:43.805]  And you know, this corporate crime has looted and drained millions of pensions of workers, small investors, laid-off workers, nobody's working for Enron anymore.
[01:33:44.225 --> 01:33:48.990]  Wall Street is a hotbed of crookery and crime, and you've got a war criminal in the White House.
[01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:54.836]  The shocking thing of it is, Alex, is how much are the American people going to take?
[01:33:54.896 --> 01:34:02.463]  Well that's my point, sir, is that they look like they're accelerating it, and I'm worried that they'll even leave office.
[01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:04.165]  I mean, are you worried they might stage something?
[01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:06.871]  I'm worried they might attack Iran.
[01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:11.695]  Yeah, I mean that way he shuts up the press, most of the press.
[01:34:11.735 --> 01:34:13.196]  He chills out the Democrats.
[01:34:13.236 --> 01:34:17.279]  He stifles dissent and concentrates more power in his hands.
[01:34:17.399 --> 01:34:29.168]  I think the hope for the country are these retired generals, admirals, national security types, the diplomats who have spoken out against the war, but they haven't organized into a powerful
[01:34:29.808 --> 01:34:33.250]  Uh, lobby against the war, against this kind of criminality.
[01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:37.992]  Although, when you talk to them, when you read their op-eds and their statements, they're just terrific patriots.
[01:34:38.032 --> 01:34:40.453]  But, one at a time doesn't do it.
[01:34:40.493 --> 01:34:44.135]  They gotta all organize, and that'll turn Congress around, let me tell you.
[01:34:44.155 --> 01:34:53.439]  We're talking about all these heroes and patriots with the ribbons and where they've served all over the country, up against these draft dodgers called George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
[01:34:53.699 --> 01:34:54.600]  It's no contest.
[01:34:55.276 --> 01:34:59.418]  Well, it is a going for broke, and you're right, there's all these great patriots fighting back against them.
[01:35:00.119 --> 01:35:02.000]  Shifting gears into another subject, GMO.
[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:09.284]  I mean, I've had the scientists who worked at the companies where all the rats would die when they feed them a potato over a few months, and then they put that on our table.
[01:35:09.504 --> 01:35:12.126]  I mean, again, it's like the corporations have gone insane.
[01:35:12.146 --> 01:35:14.948]  I don't mean your mom and pop ones, listeners, I mean the big fortune ones.
[01:35:15.228 --> 01:35:16.489]  Yeah, like Monsanto and others.
[01:35:16.729 --> 01:35:20.351]  What would you do as president against these GMOs?
[01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:27.037]  Well, first of all, suspend any further GMO foods in the marketplace.
[01:35:27.438 --> 01:35:28.819]  They are not labeled.
[01:35:28.839 --> 01:35:37.388]  95% of the American people, when they go to the supermarket, they've said they want genetically modified foods in packages and elsewhere labeled.
[01:35:37.688 --> 01:35:38.950]  And Monsanto says no.
[01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:40.231]  The people say yes.
[01:35:40.511 --> 01:35:41.492]  Monsanto wins.
[01:35:41.772 --> 01:35:42.533]  The people lose.
[01:35:42.874 --> 01:35:43.895]  No democracy there.
[01:35:44.535 --> 01:35:53.611]  Also, there's a very good group in Cambridge started by Harvard and MIT scientists called Council for Responsible Genetics.
[01:35:54.128 --> 01:35:56.310]  And the website is genewatch.org.
[01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:59.632]  That's G-E-N-E watch dot org.
[01:35:59.972 --> 01:36:01.513]  And you get good information there.
[01:36:01.853 --> 01:36:03.534]  There's been at least some progress.
[01:36:03.594 --> 01:36:12.120]  Congress is about to ban employers from deploying DNA information in order to decide whether to hire a fire department.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.081]  Oh, that's another issue.
[01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:17.944]  What about police all over the country under federal grants taking blood at checkpoints without warrants?
[01:36:18.184 --> 01:36:23.087]  There's body scanners going in the airports that literally scan your naked body and save the images.
[01:36:23.107 --> 01:36:23.748]  What would you do to that?
[01:36:24.348 --> 01:36:25.189]  Well, I'd stop that.
[01:36:25.429 --> 01:36:30.773]  Because first of all, there are some things in people's packages that these body scanners don't catch to begin with.
[01:36:31.313 --> 01:36:39.018]  And it's amazing how they want to have these body scanners, but the cargo is still very little examined of the passengers.
[01:36:39.138 --> 01:36:40.579]  One out of a hundred on the cargo ships.
[01:36:41.019 --> 01:36:44.622]  In closing, Ralph Nader, running for president, what is the strategy?
[01:36:44.682 --> 01:36:47.524]  How do we help force you into the debates?
[01:36:48.823 --> 01:36:56.427]  Well, Google at their headquarters the other week wants to do their own debates, you know, with YouTube as their subsidiary.
[01:36:56.808 --> 01:36:57.608]  They can pull it off.
[01:36:57.628 --> 01:37:02.931]  They want to start one in New Orleans, and they can deliver an audience that doesn't rely on NBC, ABC, and CBS.
[01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:03.852]  That's one.
[01:37:04.232 --> 01:37:07.594]  And the second is, really protest this debate commission.
[01:37:07.914 --> 01:37:12.036]  You can get the way to protest, go to the website OpenDebates.org.
[01:37:12.116 --> 01:37:13.177]  OpenDebates.org.
[01:37:13.217 --> 01:37:15.778]  Yeah, and you ought to have this guy George Fair on your program.
[01:37:15.818 --> 01:37:16.999]  He's the expert critic.
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:20.542]  Harvard Law grad, he's the expert critic on the debate.
[01:37:20.582 --> 01:37:23.084]  Yeah, we have these private, corporate hijackings of the process.
[01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:24.945]  Hey, listen, here's an idea, and I'm sure you've thought of it.
[01:37:25.286 --> 01:37:33.992]  Even if ABC, CBS, Fox won't let you in the debates, how about we have the real third party, the real independents, have a real Google debate, even if they won't show up?
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:35.141]  Exactly.
[01:37:35.161 --> 01:37:38.725]  They have empty chairs where these cowards are afraid to show up.
[01:37:39.045 --> 01:37:42.369]  Other western countries have five, six people on the debates.
[01:37:42.449 --> 01:37:46.473]  These guys want it all to themselves and they own the corporation.
[01:37:46.934 --> 01:37:48.075]  One minute closing statement.
[01:37:48.115 --> 01:37:48.736]  We're out of time, sir.
[01:37:50.069 --> 01:37:50.469]  All right.
[01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:54.251]  For 40 years, I've worked for the American people.
[01:37:54.351 --> 01:38:03.317]  You've got safer cars, and we've had drinking water safety, food safety, freedom of information, so you know what's going on, and you can sue the government to get information.
[01:38:03.757 --> 01:38:07.959]  We're opposed to subsidies, handouts, giveaways of your tax dollars to corporations.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:15.303]  We want to put the corporate crime wave under the rule of law and prosecute these crooks, business crooks.
[01:38:15.784 --> 01:38:16.564]  Put them in jail.
[01:38:16.864 --> 01:38:19.826]  After they're convicted, it'll improve prison conditions.
[01:38:20.339 --> 01:38:21.439]  We want to reverse U.S.
[01:38:21.499 --> 01:38:40.945]  policy in the Middle East, impeach Bush and Cheney, repeal anti-union laws, adopt a security speculation tax on Wall Street so they can reduce taxes on you as a worker, put an end to the ballot access obstructionism that keeps dissent from getting into the arena, and dissent is the mother of all assent.
[01:38:41.585 --> 01:38:48.508]  And open up, the question is, why do corporations as artificial entities have the same constitutional rights as you, real people, do?
[01:38:49.049 --> 01:38:54.351]  And if they continue to do that, there's no such thing as equal justice under the law between you and ExxonMobil.
[01:38:54.792 --> 01:39:06.177]  So, log in to votenator.org, sign on to our email list right away, and you will get a real refreshing view of what this presidential race should be all about.
[01:39:06.237 --> 01:39:08.258]  Presidential candidate Ralph Nader, thanks for joining us.
[01:39:08.278 --> 01:39:09.999]  Will you check back in when this is as this develops?
[01:39:10.478 --> 01:39:13.484]  Well, I've missed you since I saw you at Crawford the other day.
[01:39:13.624 --> 01:39:14.205]  Take care, sir.
[01:39:17.515 --> 01:39:18.276]  He's probably already gone.
[01:39:42.403 --> 01:39:42.924]  Thanks, Alec.
[01:39:42.964 --> 01:39:45.807]  We'll see you soon, and I'll get Matt Gonzales on one of these days.
[01:39:45.947 --> 01:39:47.509]  Oh, well, I'll call your campaign people today.
[01:39:48.009 --> 01:39:48.710]  Okay, very good.
[01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:49.250]  Thank you, sir.
[01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.471]  Bye-bye.
[01:39:49.491 --> 01:39:49.671]  Bye-bye.
[01:39:50.111 --> 01:39:51.753]  Alright, there goes Ralph Nader, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:51.773 --> 01:39:52.694]  We'll be back in two minutes.
[01:40:07.242 --> 01:40:10.444]  Two perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:40:10.824 --> 01:40:14.025]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:40:14.245 --> 01:40:15.926]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:40:15.986 --> 01:40:21.729]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:27.332]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:40:27.532 --> 01:40:36.596]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds
[01:40:36.596 --> 01:40:36.836]  I'm good.
[01:40:46.431 --> 01:40:47.392]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:40:47.472 --> 01:40:52.255]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:40:52.435 --> 01:41:00.220]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:05.863]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:41:06.083 --> 01:41:13.048]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:41:13.348 --> 01:41:18.691]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:41:18.931 --> 01:41:23.673]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:41:24.013 --> 01:41:31.597]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:41:31.937 --> 01:41:38.180]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:39.701]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:39.961]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:41:40.041 --> 01:41:43.763]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[01:41:43.783 --> 01:41:44.803]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:41:55.683 --> 01:42:00.147]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:42:00.468 --> 01:42:02.589]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:05.092]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[01:42:05.372 --> 01:42:08.275]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:42:10.296 --> 01:42:12.398]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:18.124]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:42:20.012 --> 01:42:24.553]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:42:24.593 --> 01:42:27.734]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:42:29.434 --> 01:42:34.335]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[01:42:34.395 --> 01:42:37.456]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:42:38.876 --> 01:42:41.016]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[01:42:41.096 --> 01:42:43.277]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:42:47.083 --> 01:42:51.286]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[01:42:51.486 --> 01:42:53.447]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:42:53.627 --> 01:42:58.751]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about a simple technology you can have right now.
[01:42:59.011 --> 01:43:03.213]  GasFreedom is a do-it-yourself, affordable, practical, free-energy device.
[01:43:03.454 --> 01:43:07.856]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:43:09.097 --> 01:43:09.497]  Oh, yeah!
[01:43:09.517 --> 01:43:11.058]  So that might be the end.
[01:43:39.005 --> 01:43:40.125]  I got a lot of love.
[01:43:40.145 --> 01:43:42.806]  I just love everybody.
[01:43:45.287 --> 01:43:46.827]  Until I see them hurt innocent people.
[01:43:46.907 --> 01:43:50.108]  Until I see them push little people around.
[01:43:50.128 --> 01:43:52.589]  Until they try to push me around.
[01:43:53.989 --> 01:43:54.589]  That's right.
[01:43:55.689 --> 01:43:56.890]  I'm not here to be a slave.
[01:43:57.570 --> 01:44:03.231]  I'm not here to have my creativity and my liberty and my mobility stifled.
[01:44:03.972 --> 01:44:05.372]  I'm not giving in to the new world order.
[01:44:07.754 --> 01:44:08.935]  I'm not going quietly.
[01:44:11.377 --> 01:44:12.118]  End of the night.
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:17.102]  Well, the Lisbon Treaty shot down, official.
[01:44:17.282 --> 01:44:22.166]  And they say they're going to go ahead and try to ram through EU takeover of Ireland.
[01:44:23.727 --> 01:44:26.129]  Whether the people like it or not.
[01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:28.591]  Keep it rolling, I like it.
[01:44:34.329 --> 01:44:35.110]  Oh no!
[01:45:06.786 --> 01:45:08.908]  You know, I wish I could just sit here and listen to music on the show.
[01:45:09.248 --> 01:45:14.633]  I guess I'd be a disc jockey.
[01:45:14.814 --> 01:45:16.015]  What an easy job.
[01:45:16.035 --> 01:45:22.080]  You know, it's very satisfying.
[01:45:39.652 --> 01:45:42.274]  So satisfying to fight tyranny.
[01:45:42.294 --> 01:45:55.581]  To take action against evil and to see it bear such incredible fruit.
[01:45:57.121 --> 01:45:57.782]  Oh yeah!
[01:46:00.143 --> 01:46:03.805]  I mean it is so important
[01:46:11.954 --> 01:46:19.696]  To come together as we pull through this dark night.
[01:46:20.016 --> 01:46:28.639]  You know they say that adversity makes men and plenty makes monsters.
[01:46:30.639 --> 01:46:35.401]  It is adversity that brings out the greatest in all of us.
[01:46:35.461 --> 01:46:38.942]  This Madison Avenue materialism
[01:46:40.322 --> 01:46:42.303]  Is what has brought us to what we are today.
[01:46:44.324 --> 01:46:46.245]  But now the pendulum begins to swing back.
[01:46:46.285 --> 01:46:50.987]  As tyranny comes to its greatest level in modern history.
[01:46:52.408 --> 01:46:56.429]  With a scientific overlay the likes of which was never even dreamed.
[01:46:59.671 --> 01:47:06.054]  We see ragtag groups who love liberty and hate tyranny.
[01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:10.002]  Coming together on a thousand fronts.
[01:47:10.462 --> 01:47:13.384]  Oh yeah.
[01:47:13.724 --> 01:47:18.286]  I know your heart's like mine.
[01:47:20.087 --> 01:47:23.088]  And that's really it.
[01:47:25.529 --> 01:47:34.313]  It is so good to be able to commune with all of you.
[01:47:38.717 --> 01:47:39.838]  To know that we're together.
[01:47:43.541 --> 01:47:58.394]  To know that we're going through that long night and we're coming through on the other side with daybreak and the rebirth of liberty and humanity pointing its great creativity and its love towards the stars.
[01:48:02.678 --> 01:48:06.341]  I am just so honored and humbled to know all of you.
[01:48:10.290 --> 01:48:14.593]  And I'll tell you right now that we are having a huge effect.
[01:48:16.214 --> 01:48:18.655]  And yeah, I'm having adrenaline rushes right now.
[01:48:20.736 --> 01:48:27.561]  I'm having endorphins being released in my mind right now because I know what matters.
[01:48:28.441 --> 01:48:29.322]  I know what's important.
[01:48:29.342 --> 01:48:32.884]  And we've had some amazing victories in the last few days.
[01:48:34.885 --> 01:48:37.187]  We're having a victory that we're waking up so many people.
[01:48:38.203 --> 01:48:54.912]  We're having victories that we just shot down the Libsyn Treaty, with EU expansion into Ireland that will force the enemy now to act like what they are, dictators, and move ahead with force implementation that will only swell our numbers and accelerate the explosion of the alternative media.
[01:48:55.673 --> 01:49:00.295]  The enemy will then move to block the internet, and that will only prove our case that much more.
[01:49:00.855 --> 01:49:03.097]  Victory is within sight.
[01:49:04.377 --> 01:49:05.298]  We're on the march.
[01:49:05.778 --> 01:49:07.279]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:49:08.294 --> 01:49:11.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:14.295 --> 01:49:21.637]  Propansion into Ireland that will force the enemy now to act like what they are, dictators, and move ahead with forced implementation.
[01:49:22.397 --> 01:49:27.158]  That will only swell our numbers and accelerate the explosion of the alternative media.
[01:49:27.878 --> 01:49:32.499]  The enemy will then move to block the internet, and that will only prove our case that much more.
[01:49:33.079 --> 01:49:35.280]  Victory is within sight.
[01:49:36.542 --> 01:49:39.563]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:49:40.484 --> 01:49:43.245]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:46.487 --> 01:49:58.492]  Prepare for an uncertain future with DVDs from the winner of 13 telly awards, Hoods Woods is... All back through the years, when dad was around.
[01:50:02.378 --> 01:50:10.787]  His big hands, I recall, impressed me most of all when Dad was around.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:24.163]  Doing the chores, getting things at the stores.
[01:50:25.304 --> 01:50:29.827]  Hunting, fishing, I was five then eleven.
[01:50:30.527 --> 01:50:36.711]  His big hands in those days showed me all of his ways.
[01:50:37.251 --> 01:50:40.213]  Oh, when dad was around,
[01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:55.074]  From twelve to twenty, We were happy, had twenty, When Dad was around.
[01:50:57.914 --> 01:51:06.157]  His big hands were still guiding, In each other confiding, When Dad was around.
[01:51:12.148 --> 01:51:15.609]  We have to find the people who are doing this, take them out, and shoot them.
[01:51:17.829 --> 01:51:18.089]  Really.
[01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:27.491]  Just find the people who are sending those letters to our troops to demoralize our troops and do what they're doing, you take them out, they are traitors to this country, and shoot them.
[01:51:28.751 --> 01:51:29.712]  You have a problem with that?
[01:51:30.052 --> 01:51:30.572]  Deal with it.
[01:51:31.972 --> 01:51:35.633]  But anybody who would do that doesn't deserve to live.
[01:51:35.893 --> 01:51:36.473]  You shoot them.
[01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:40.634]  You call them traitors, that's what they are, and you shoot them dead.
[01:51:42.501 --> 01:51:43.362]  I'll pay for the bullet.
[01:51:45.543 --> 01:51:52.649]  Mark Dice, the founder of the Resistance, which he calls a media watchdog group, says that the U.S.
[01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:57.593]  government was responsible for the September 11th terrorist attacks and that the armed forces should know it.
[01:51:58.553 --> 01:51:59.614]  People want the facts.
[01:52:00.255 --> 01:52:02.036]  The Marines are hungry for the truth.
[01:52:02.356 --> 01:52:03.677]  What got them there in Iraq?
[01:52:04.478 --> 01:52:06.279]  Why are they risking their lives?
[01:52:06.539 --> 01:52:08.621]  And we're going to help them understand that.
[01:52:09.822 --> 01:52:11.043]  So he's going to send letters
[01:52:12.205 --> 01:52:20.568]  And declassified government documents that he says can prove the government's responsibility for the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
[01:52:20.808 --> 01:52:22.609]  And he's urging others to do the same.
[01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:30.692]  Now, Captain Pete Hegseth, Executive Director of Vets for Freedom, you ought to get him on too, Brett.
[01:52:31.233 --> 01:52:32.453]  I'm on it.
[01:52:33.854 --> 01:52:39.976]  Says, you know something, these are going to end up in the trash, or they're going to end up in the toilet, or they're going to end up
[01:52:41.616 --> 01:52:42.457]  On the firing range.
[01:52:43.357 --> 01:52:47.820]  How about you take Mark Dice out and put him in the middle of the firing range?
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:54.184]  Tie him to a post, don't blindfold him, let it rip and have some fun with Mark Dice.
[01:52:54.645 --> 01:52:57.346]  These people are just, folks, I'm telling you, outrageous.
[01:52:57.947 --> 01:52:59.388]  Now we know where the Ron Paul supporters went.
[01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:01.069]  All right.
[01:53:02.029 --> 01:53:04.291]  Now that is who is outrageous.
[01:53:04.551 --> 01:53:07.413]  Who you were just hearing there is who is outrageous.
[01:53:08.033 --> 01:53:10.035]  We have a constitutional right to the First Amendment.
[01:53:10.936 --> 01:53:16.543]  We had We Are Change arrested and ticketed in Denver for on the streets of Denver handing out DVDs yesterday.
[01:53:16.563 --> 01:53:17.884]  We're going to be getting them on Sunday.
[01:53:18.765 --> 01:53:22.570]  We had We Are Change videotaping outside an event with Colin Powell.
[01:53:22.890 --> 01:53:26.034]  They arrested them and charged them with trespassing for being on the city sidewalk.
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:31.001]  They are openly calling to put us in camps, beat us, send us to secret camps.
[01:53:31.081 --> 01:53:32.882]  They said that on the morning show with Joe Scarborough.
[01:53:33.942 --> 01:53:35.763]  These are serious people, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:36.603 --> 01:53:40.204]  They are trying to say that we're involved in bombings and terrorism, just making it up.
[01:53:41.724 --> 01:53:44.085]  Mark Dice had the great idea earlier this week.
[01:53:45.635 --> 01:53:50.258]  And Fox had the headline, 9-11 truthers go postal.
[01:53:51.039 --> 01:53:53.121]  And then it went to say, we want to mail them to the post office.
[01:53:53.161 --> 01:53:56.483]  But the headline implies we're killing people, while they say they want to kill us.
[01:53:56.923 --> 01:54:05.330]  Mark, you have to take legal action on Michael Reagan, because this is what the Nazis did the first few years, beating people up, calling for violence, saying we should be killed.
[01:54:06.170 --> 01:54:11.092]  I mean, he's the guy with the party who helped destroy the borders, who helped triple the size of government.
[01:54:11.112 --> 01:54:11.973]  They're not conservatives.
[01:54:11.993 --> 01:54:12.813]  They lied to us.
[01:54:13.173 --> 01:54:15.894]  We know the Republican memos say they want more 9-11s.
[01:54:15.914 --> 01:54:17.335]  They wanted 9-11 before it happened.
[01:54:17.635 --> 01:54:20.456]  PNAC said September 2000, rebuilding America's defenses.
[01:54:21.617 --> 01:54:22.737]  You're getting all these threats.
[01:54:22.937 --> 01:54:23.737]  I'm getting threats.
[01:54:24.098 --> 01:54:25.718]  And this guy is on hundreds of stations.
[01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:26.879]  I know he's on in San Antonio.
[01:54:27.759 --> 01:54:31.701]  Right here, we can hear him in Austin, calling for your murder.
[01:54:32.577 --> 01:54:34.960]  I mean, there's no doubt that they want tyranny in this country.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:36.722]  Mark Dice, what was it like for you to learn of this?
[01:54:37.858 --> 01:54:38.579]  It's pretty shocking.
[01:54:38.599 --> 01:54:40.240]  I actually contacted the FBI.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.441]  I filed a report with them.
[01:54:41.481 --> 01:54:44.383]  The agent on the case got back with me shortly after.
[01:54:44.403 --> 01:54:48.006]  He's asking me to forward the death threats that I've been getting in the email.
[01:54:48.606 --> 01:54:50.047]  I've contacted the FCC.
[01:54:50.127 --> 01:54:56.732]  I've sent out a press release to every major news agency about this, demanding that he be fired and legal action be taken.
[01:54:57.193 --> 01:54:59.995]  You can go to MarkDice.com and get a copy of the press release.
[01:55:00.055 --> 01:55:02.497]  I just want to ask everybody to send it out to all the media.
[01:55:03.263 --> 01:55:04.604]  This is completely unacceptable.
[01:55:04.644 --> 01:55:06.546]  This is beyond the pale.
[01:55:06.586 --> 01:55:07.967]  He's more than crossed the line.
[01:55:08.608 --> 01:55:13.092]  They are the terrorists, and I'm going to pursue as much legal action as I can.
[01:55:13.132 --> 01:55:18.017]  Well, there's a lot of weak-minded nutcases that love the New World Order, and they may kill you.
[01:55:18.577 --> 01:55:22.501]  I mean, they may take a shot at you, Mark, and then that son of a bitch is definitely going to go to prison.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:25.321]  And not only that, he wants to pay for the bullet too.
[01:55:25.521 --> 01:55:28.083]  Yeah, he is calling for murder.
[01:55:28.303 --> 01:55:30.824]  He contracted murder on air.
[01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:32.685]  And we got the whole tape.
[01:55:32.705 --> 01:55:33.826]  He didn't say it was a joke.
[01:55:34.146 --> 01:55:35.187]  He called.
[01:55:35.447 --> 01:55:36.948]  He solicited murder.
[01:55:37.208 --> 01:55:39.969]  He solicited premeditated capital murder.
[01:55:39.989 --> 01:55:41.190]  I hope you put that in your press release.
[01:55:41.770 --> 01:55:44.171]  In fact, that's the headline we should have at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:44.191 --> 01:55:51.175]  I know there's some stories, Kurt Nemo's already gotten up there, but Michael Reagan, son of the President, contracts for murder on air.
[01:55:51.535 --> 01:55:52.555]  He was serious.
[01:55:52.816 --> 01:55:56.577]  He called for your murder three separate times and offered to pay for it.
[01:55:57.418 --> 01:56:05.722]  Yeah, now there's another talk show host, I'm not going to name, that has called for the murder of judges in the past, and people have went out, his listeners have went out and murdered them.
[01:56:06.491 --> 01:56:13.213]  This is very serious, which is why I contacted the FBI, and we're going to do everything that we can to take all the legal recourse against this.
[01:56:13.673 --> 01:56:16.534]  This is very sad, very shocking.
[01:56:17.554 --> 01:56:19.215]  They've crossed a new line here now.
[01:56:19.535 --> 01:56:20.695]  No, no, they're desperate.
[01:56:21.416 --> 01:56:29.658]  My family's getting threats after they tried to call my wife as I was leaving Bilderberg, and said that I'd gotten a woman pregnant, and of course was made up to freak her out.
[01:56:30.038 --> 01:56:33.219]  Then stuff about burning my house down, going after my children.
[01:56:33.239 --> 01:56:35.320]  I mean, these are the scum of the earth.
[01:56:36.491 --> 01:56:47.175]  Even if it's not a government job, by putting the word out there, by encouraging that, some psycho, some mentally unstable person, what they're hoping is will track us down and do their dirty work for them, and he needs to be held accountable.
[01:56:47.648 --> 01:56:50.549]  I'll keep everybody informed on what's going on with the case here.
[01:56:51.149 --> 01:56:54.730]  And please go to MarkDice.com, get the press release that I have posted there.
[01:56:55.190 --> 01:56:59.391]  It has a link to his statement in there and email it to all the major media institutions.
[01:57:00.091 --> 01:57:01.312]  Let's get this man fired.
[01:57:01.612 --> 01:57:03.872]  Well, I want to say this to everybody out there.
[01:57:04.192 --> 01:57:06.513]  I've got a Second Amendment right to defend myself and my family.
[01:57:07.233 --> 01:57:10.755]  Listen, I'm six foot three, I'm 210 pounds, I'm trained in martial arts, I have firearms,
[01:57:29.133 --> 01:57:33.395]  We'll take all the legal duties to defend myself and my family and my property.
[01:57:33.415 --> 01:57:35.676]  And they demonized the Black Panthers, that's all they said.
[01:57:35.716 --> 01:57:37.417]  They said, we will protect ourselves.
[01:57:38.137 --> 01:57:39.658]  This is strictly in self-defense.
[01:57:39.718 --> 01:57:41.098]  We're not an offensive movement.
[01:57:41.138 --> 01:57:46.360]  This is an information outreach, and now they're threatening us with contract killings, with murder.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:48.181]  This is just absolutely ridiculous.
[01:57:48.801 --> 01:57:50.082]  I don't even know what else to say.
[01:57:50.422 --> 01:57:51.242]  I'm just so pissed.
[01:57:51.603 --> 01:57:53.884]  I'm trying not to just yell on the phone and get out of control.
[01:57:53.924 --> 01:57:55.184]  No, go ahead, get out of control.
[01:57:55.204 --> 01:57:56.885]  So what's it going to take to get this country back?
[01:57:58.647 --> 01:57:59.288]  Oh, I know, man.
[01:57:59.308 --> 01:58:03.250]  You know, I put the phone number for his network, for his studio on there.
[01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:04.190]  I want everybody to call that.
[01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:06.151]  There's an email link to the FCC.
[01:58:06.732 --> 01:58:08.353]  You can file a complaint with him.
[01:58:08.593 --> 01:58:13.215]  I have information for the date of the broadcast and just include maybe my press release.
[01:58:13.235 --> 01:58:14.376]  Yeah, when was the date of this?
[01:58:14.396 --> 01:58:15.096]  Was this yesterday?
[01:58:15.697 --> 01:58:21.240]  This was Tuesday, June 10th, during the second hour of his program, which is nationally syndicated.
[01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:22.661]  I believe he has millions of listeners.
[01:58:22.701 --> 01:58:24.542]  This is a talking head that's been on Fox News.
[01:58:24.782 --> 01:58:26.623]  He's the adopted son of Ronald Reagan.
[01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:29.523]  And, well, you know, I don't know much about Ronald Reagan.
[01:58:29.543 --> 01:58:35.272]  We know he was involved with Iran-Contra and the Bohemian Grove, but his contract killings were at least done in private.
[01:58:37.591 --> 01:58:38.711]  Well, we're not going to put up with this.
[01:58:38.751 --> 01:58:40.432]  He needs to be arrested immediately.
[01:58:40.452 --> 01:58:43.273]  And it's time for these terrorists to be brought to justice.
[01:58:44.253 --> 01:58:46.314]  How dare them threaten my wife and my children?
[01:58:46.354 --> 01:58:47.414]  How dare them do this?
[01:58:47.814 --> 01:58:49.635]  How dare them do this to you, Mark?
[01:58:49.955 --> 01:58:54.676]  The agent that I talked to, I mean, we know that there's corrupt elements within the FBI, but they do a lot of good work.
[01:58:54.696 --> 01:58:57.837]  They do a lot of legitimate investigations.
[01:58:57.877 --> 01:58:59.338]  Same with the police and the military.
[01:59:00.078 --> 01:59:04.719]  And so we can only hope that the agents on this case are legitimate and are going to fight for the Constitution.
[01:59:04.739 --> 01:59:06.120]  They're going to fight for my civil rights.
[01:59:07.399 --> 01:59:09.059]  Michael Reagan fully responsible.
[01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:14.061]  In case there's any questions about it, tell us in a minute.
[01:59:14.081 --> 01:59:15.561]  Let's just play the whole clip right now.
[01:59:15.641 --> 01:59:16.221]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:59:16.241 --> 01:59:16.961]  It's about two minutes.
[01:59:17.001 --> 01:59:18.182]  Here it is.
[01:59:18.522 --> 01:59:29.505]  This is the contract killing, the call for a contract killing, soliciting capital murder to, he's in the top ten, he's the ninth largest host in the country, rated at four million listeners per day.
[01:59:30.005 --> 01:59:34.786]  This is four million people hearing for the contract murder of Mark Dice for engaging in the First Amendment.
[01:59:34.826 --> 01:59:35.146]  Here it is.
[01:59:35.865 --> 01:59:39.346]  We've got to find the people who are doing this, take them out, and shoot them.
[01:59:41.566 --> 01:59:41.806]  Really.
[01:59:42.326 --> 01:59:51.228]  Just find the people who are sending those letters to our troops to demoralize our troops and do what they're doing, you take them out, they are traitors to this country, and shoot them.
[01:59:52.488 --> 01:59:53.449]  You have a problem with that?
[01:59:53.789 --> 01:59:54.309]  Deal with it.
[01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:59.370]  But anybody who would do that doesn't deserve to live.
[01:59:59.630 --> 02:00:00.210]  You shoot them.
[02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:04.371]  You call them traitors, that's what they are, and you shoot them dead.
[02:00:06.238 --> 02:00:07.098]  I'll pay for the bullet.
[02:00:09.279 --> 02:00:16.360]  Mark Dice, the founder of the Resistance, which he calls a media watchdog group, says that the U.S.
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:21.321]  government was responsible for the September 11th terrorist attacks and that the armed forces should know it.
[02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:23.341]  People want the facts.
[02:00:23.981 --> 02:00:25.761]  The Marines are hungry for the truth.
[02:00:26.081 --> 02:00:27.382]  What got them there in Iraq?
[02:00:28.202 --> 02:00:30.002]  Why are they risking their lives?
[02:00:30.262 --> 02:00:32.343]  And we're going to help them understand that.
[02:00:33.543 --> 02:00:34.763]  So he's going to send letters
[02:00:35.942 --> 02:00:44.306]  And declassified government documents that he says can prove the government's responsibility for the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
[02:00:44.546 --> 02:00:46.347]  And he's urging others to do the same.
[02:00:47.648 --> 02:00:54.431]  Now, Captain Pete Hegseth, Executive Director of Vets for Freedom, you ought to get him on too, Brett.
[02:00:54.952 --> 02:00:56.192]  I'm on it.
[02:00:57.573 --> 02:01:03.716]  Says, you know something, these are going to end up in the trash, or they're going to end up in the toilet, or they're going to end up
[02:01:05.353 --> 02:01:06.173]  on the firing range.
[02:01:07.094 --> 02:01:11.555]  How about you take Mark Dice out and put him in the middle of the firing range.
[02:01:12.015 --> 02:01:13.295]  Tie him to a post.
[02:01:13.676 --> 02:01:14.636]  Don't blindfold him.
[02:01:15.216 --> 02:01:17.917]  Let it rip and have some fun with Mark Dice.
[02:01:18.377 --> 02:01:21.078]  These people are just, folks, I'm telling you, outrageous.
[02:01:21.678 --> 02:01:23.118]  Now we know where the Ron Paul supporters went.
[02:01:24.379 --> 02:01:24.899]  Oh, my God.
[02:01:25.199 --> 02:01:26.539]  That was a mean thing to say, Brett.
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:27.880]  That was a mean thing.
[02:01:27.900 --> 02:01:28.880]  You know how mean that was to say?
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:29.160]  Yeah.
[02:01:29.180 --> 02:01:29.940]  Sorry if I offended Mark.
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:31.281]  They hate real constitutionalists.
[02:01:32.301 --> 02:01:37.385]  You know, I also want to urge everybody, too, for those who didn't know about the campaign, the Operation Inform the Soldiers.
[02:01:38.245 --> 02:01:40.307]  Information's on MarkDice.com about that.
[02:01:40.347 --> 02:01:45.070]  Yeah, this is only going to make us send out more now that they've engaged in this treason, this crime.
[02:01:45.771 --> 02:01:51.495]  You know, Mark, this is so amazing that he would seriously do this, and there's more at the first of it.
[02:01:52.055 --> 02:01:52.655]  There's more.
[02:01:52.675 --> 02:01:54.657]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:01:54.737 --> 02:01:58.540]  It's up at MarkDice.com, TheResistanceManifesto.com.
[02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:01.782]  People have to get behind you, Mark, and us, like never before.
[02:02:02.262 --> 02:02:11.690]  These sudden threats, you know, saying we should all go to FEMA camps, be tortured to death on MSNBC, on CNN, on Fox, saying we're criminals, we need to be arrested.
[02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:13.051]  I mean, we're hurting them.
[02:02:13.331 --> 02:02:15.773]  Make no mistake, listeners, it's you doing it, getting the word out.
[02:02:16.054 --> 02:02:16.754]  They're getting desperate.
[02:02:16.794 --> 02:02:17.795]  Mark Dicer, take on that.
[02:02:18.476 --> 02:02:21.678]  You can hear the anger and the hatred in his voice, and everybody knows this.
[02:02:21.979 --> 02:02:28.324]  And that's because they know that we know that the globalists did 9-11, and they've been defending this system, and they're getting scared they're going to go to prison.
[02:02:29.335 --> 02:02:37.680]  I was on the biggest talk show in Los Angeles, KFI 640, yesterday with Bill Handel, and he knew and he acknowledged that a third of the American people believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:40.041]  So we should all be shot, though!
[02:02:40.061 --> 02:02:48.146]  36% of us believe total inside job, 84%, Angus and Reed, New York Times Poll believe they may have carried it out, 84% of us need to be killed.
[02:02:48.886 --> 02:02:55.090]  Listen, if you don't want to spend the money to send the troops letters and DVDs, there's also programs where you can email the troops, which is free.
[02:02:55.951 --> 02:03:02.435]  Go to my press release and there's a couple websites on there where you can sign up for free and email back and forth with the troops and let's email them links.
[02:03:02.515 --> 02:03:08.839]  And they're going to put spooks on trying to stop those, so send it under other names, other places, but also do it through churches.
[02:03:08.859 --> 02:03:17.285]  There's thousands of groups doing this so that they can't coordinate stopping us and they're worried because tyranny comes to your door in the form of a uniform or as military or police.
[02:03:17.605 --> 02:03:22.208]  If we're able to wake all them up, that's what Jack McClamson has been doing for 27 years, it's game over for them.
[02:03:22.912 --> 02:03:29.218]  Yeah, I'm sending my material through a surrogate just because I'm sure that they've been, my name's been flagged, and any material that I send's probably not going to make it through.
[02:03:29.858 --> 02:03:42.089]  But if we get thousands of people to at least send emails with links and documents and YouTube videos, the troops will get it, they'll read it, and I'm sure that a lot of the troops are going to appreciate it and are going to send us back emails saying that they understand.
[02:03:42.269 --> 02:03:48.655]  I want to say something, Mark, to the military and police and the secret police that were following me in Virginia last week, admittedly, in the video we got of it.
[02:03:49.295 --> 02:03:50.397]  You know the government's bad.
[02:03:50.437 --> 02:03:51.358]  You know you're doing wrong.
[02:03:51.398 --> 02:03:53.240]  You know torture of children is wrong in memos.
[02:03:53.621 --> 02:03:56.144]  You know the rape of women in front of their husbands is wrong.
[02:03:56.425 --> 02:04:00.210]  You know sniping families off the side of the road for target practice and laughing is wrong.
[02:04:00.490 --> 02:04:01.552]  You know calling for U.S.
[02:04:01.592 --> 02:04:03.554]  citizens' murder is wrong.
[02:04:03.835 --> 02:04:05.036]  You know it's wrong.
[02:04:05.076 --> 02:04:06.879]  You know the pension funds being robbed are wrong.
[02:04:07.099 --> 02:04:08.480]  You know the NAU is wrong.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:09.842]  You know the open borders are wrong.
[02:04:10.162 --> 02:04:12.704]  You know trillions missing from the Pentagon is wrong.
[02:04:12.964 --> 02:04:14.366]  You know you're in the wrong.
[02:04:14.826 --> 02:04:20.191]  And I want to tell people in the government engaged in crimes, if you won't join us, at least stand down and commit in crimes.
[02:04:20.671 --> 02:04:23.654]  Because Mark, I mean, he admittedly got White House talking points.
[02:04:23.674 --> 02:04:25.896]  He's one of the guys that goes to the White House and has those public meetings.
[02:04:26.236 --> 02:04:27.698]  This is a White House threat.
[02:04:28.158 --> 02:04:30.119]  This is, we are going to kill you.
[02:04:30.759 --> 02:04:33.200]  And my whole point is, we're committed, we're not stopping.
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:37.161]  I told people this week, I felt the threshold go up to a whole new level.
[02:04:37.201 --> 02:04:38.601]  Mark, are you committed?
[02:04:38.621 --> 02:04:39.662]  You're never stopping.
[02:04:39.922 --> 02:04:40.502]  That's the key.
[02:04:40.562 --> 02:04:42.323]  Everybody else, they can't stop us all.
[02:04:43.023 --> 02:04:50.725]  No, the can of worms I've doped is out, and my friends and family have your numbers, Alex, and others, and if anything happens to me, they're going to contact you immediately.
[02:04:51.185 --> 02:04:55.647]  They also have other radio stations, other courses of action that will be taken if anything happens.
[02:04:56.347 --> 02:05:04.750]  Uh... any funny business so that they can't stop us and they're they're getting so angry that they're I don't think that they know what to do and they're just speaking right off the top of their head.
[02:05:05.570 --> 02:05:24.077]  They're cornered criminals but I would add this I'm non-violent but when they threaten my family and other people they change the rules of war and they need to know that I'm on air telling everybody don't be violent they didn't understand something happens to Mark Dice, something happens to you uh... this is maybe what they want is an escalation but the whole point is is that they're crossing lines
[02:05:25.037 --> 02:05:50.203]  uh... that uh... they shouldn't be crossing and then my god michael reagan has really i mean uh... coming out saying you need to be murdered he better hope and pray civilly criminally and also a retribution there's a lot of unstable people listen to this show i mean there are hundreds of thousands of hardcore special ops retired vets people in there and they are just they know folks and i think i'm a law-abiding citizen you're a law-abiding citizen were were non-violent informational outreach
[02:05:51.103 --> 02:06:02.310]  Self-defense is our legal right, and if your life or somebody else's life is in immediate danger, you have the legal right to take the course of action that will protect that individual, even if that results in the attacker's death.
[02:06:02.610 --> 02:06:12.356]  I want to make that clear, that we know our rights, we're law-abiding citizens, and we're non-violent, but we're not going to just stand by and let ourselves be attacked or harmed in any way.
[02:06:14.217 --> 02:06:14.857]  Amen to that!
[02:06:15.317 --> 02:06:19.480]  I mean, this is... Mark, I'm just speechless right now hearing that.
[02:06:20.427 --> 02:06:27.011]  I don't know what to do, and you know, at first I was so in shock, and then I started really thinking about the ramifications of this, which is why I contacted the FBI.
[02:06:27.191 --> 02:06:46.541]  I've been in contact with this agent, and we're going to see what we can do in taking all the legal action that we can to the FCC, to the press, and we're going to send a message that this is not tolerable, that they are the terrorists, they're the anti-Americans, they're trying to eliminate our constitutional rights, our Second Amendment, and I want to just
[02:06:48.082 --> 02:06:52.686]  I'll just make this clear that the Constitution lists the amendments in the order of importance.
[02:06:53.007 --> 02:06:57.711]  The first one is the right to freedom of speech, and the second one is the right to bear arms.
[02:06:57.811 --> 02:07:07.180]  I also want to make everybody clear that Jesus himself said to sell your clothes and sell your goods and buy a sword.
[02:07:09.577 --> 02:07:10.458]  Yeah, there's no doubt.
[02:07:10.498 --> 02:07:15.982]  These are rogue criminals, mad dog killers out of control, who are so criminal, they just think they can let it all hang out.
[02:07:16.082 --> 02:07:17.703]  And I think they've way overreached here, Mark.
[02:07:18.023 --> 02:07:19.144]  Stay there for a final segment.
[02:07:19.164 --> 02:07:24.608]  I want to give out the number to the neocon fake conservative anti-American network he's on.
[02:07:25.208 --> 02:07:27.430]  And then, look, you fake conservatives, the jig's up.
[02:07:28.010 --> 02:07:31.833]  You've attacked Ron Paul, everybody else, your name is mud, your ratings are plummeting, you're falling apart.
[02:07:32.333 --> 02:07:34.415]  We will not sit here and take your crime anymore.
[02:07:34.835 --> 02:07:36.917]  We will not take your criminal activity anymore.
[02:07:37.417 --> 02:07:39.378]  You're on the losing side, you're on the wrong side.
[02:07:39.619 --> 02:07:42.381]  We're gonna give out phone numbers to these criminals and to the FCC.
[02:07:42.721 --> 02:07:44.382]  On the other side, with Mark Dice, stay with us.
[02:07:45.923 --> 02:07:51.568]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:07:51.748 --> 02:07:54.069]  But as you know, most people are overly... One second.
[02:07:55.971 --> 02:07:56.151]  Go ahead.
[02:07:56.724 --> 02:07:57.004]  Mark?
[02:07:57.524 --> 02:07:57.684]  Yeah.
[02:07:58.404 --> 02:08:01.085]  Yeah, this is going to be, uh, this is very serious.
[02:08:01.445 --> 02:08:02.986]  He did that in a premeditated fashion.
[02:08:03.526 --> 02:08:04.746]  Oh yeah, and he repeated it three times.
[02:08:05.346 --> 02:08:07.947]  Do you have, uh, the FCC's number?
[02:08:08.927 --> 02:08:10.788]  Yeah, I emailed them on their complaint line.
[02:08:10.808 --> 02:08:11.408]  I have their numbers.
[02:08:11.428 --> 02:08:12.088]  I haven't had time.
[02:08:12.128 --> 02:08:12.849]  I've been too busy.
[02:08:12.869 --> 02:08:13.929]  Give it all out on air.
[02:08:15.449 --> 02:08:16.830]  And what network is he with?
[02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:19.691]  Radio America.
[02:08:19.751 --> 02:08:21.231]  I have the number to his syndicator.
[02:08:21.969 --> 02:08:27.232]  And I got through to them and told them what happened, and they put me through to the producer, so if we just... I'll give that number out.
[02:08:27.292 --> 02:08:29.294]  Let me Google the FCC's number here again.
[02:08:29.314 --> 02:08:32.516]  Yeah, you want complaints, you want... yeah.
[02:08:33.076 --> 02:08:36.418]  And then, uh, what FBI... I would call multiple FBI offices.
[02:08:36.798 --> 02:08:37.739]  What FBI did you call?
[02:08:38.359 --> 02:08:39.760]  I called the local San Diego office.
[02:08:41.961 --> 02:08:44.023]  Did you... did you tell them you expect immediate action?
[02:08:45.023 --> 02:08:47.445]  Yeah, she called me back within probably 20 minutes or so.
[02:08:47.505 --> 02:08:49.106]  She had talking with, uh, I think it was the...
[02:08:49.813 --> 02:08:51.394]  Yeah, you need to put the headline out!
[02:08:51.414 --> 02:08:51.494]  What?
[02:09:01.417 --> 02:09:01.857]  I can't hear you.
[02:09:02.417 --> 02:09:03.098]  Oh, we're still rolling?
[02:09:03.158 --> 02:09:04.638]  Okay, I didn't even know we were still on the internet.
[02:09:04.858 --> 02:09:05.819]  We're going to upload all that.
[02:09:06.159 --> 02:09:09.940]  Look, there's no doubt that what we need to put out is what this is.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.141]  He's solicited for capital murder.
[02:09:12.941 --> 02:09:15.122]  That is a highest level felony.
[02:09:15.162 --> 02:09:16.723]  I mean, that is considered murder.
[02:09:16.983 --> 02:09:25.546]  To solicit it, I believe under federal code and state law, you can even get death penalty for soliciting murder because it's considered almost a murder.
[02:09:26.586 --> 02:09:28.167]  Normally you get life in prison for that.
[02:09:28.728 --> 02:09:30.529]  And he didn't say he was joking.
[02:09:30.949 --> 02:09:33.011]  He didn't qualify it, which would have been bad enough.
[02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:34.972]  It's a terrific threat at the bare minimum.
[02:09:35.452 --> 02:09:40.235]  And then on that sliding scale, he solicited for murder, Mark.
[02:09:41.156 --> 02:09:47.560]  So he has solicited for murder to four million people and then offered monetary consideration.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.742]  This is a serious felony.
[02:09:50.442 --> 02:09:56.226]  And, you know, the agent on this also suggested that we get in contact with the FCC, with his producers, with his... Alright, pull those numbers up.
[02:09:56.246 --> 02:09:57.006]  We're back in one minute.
[02:09:57.026 --> 02:09:57.967]  I want to give them all out.
[02:09:59.408 --> 02:10:00.008]  Good God.
[02:10:00.909 --> 02:10:04.731]  This is just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, as you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:10:05.311 --> 02:10:07.753]  We need people to get all these videos, edit them, get them out.
[02:10:07.793 --> 02:10:08.954]  We'll post them on the websites.
[02:10:10.254 --> 02:10:12.776]  Oh, I was planning to take a few days off next week and have Burma sitting in.
[02:10:12.816 --> 02:10:13.817]  I may not even do that now.
[02:10:13.937 --> 02:10:15.318]  I want to see my family when I'm out of town.
[02:10:16.195 --> 02:10:17.676]  It's just all going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:10:17.696 --> 02:10:20.858]  These criminals are not going to stop, and he has committed a very serious crime.
[02:10:21.318 --> 02:10:25.340]  But hell, Michael Savage gets up and says, anybody against the ward, he's to be put in a camp, a forced labor camp.
[02:10:26.081 --> 02:10:28.882]  Oh, that dirty beatnik from the 60s, I'm so sick of this trash.
[02:10:29.283 --> 02:10:32.064]  How these mainline conservatives can be fooled by him, God Almighty.
[02:10:32.084 --> 02:10:34.606]  Alright, Mark, we're coming back in ten seconds, okay?
[02:10:36.127 --> 02:10:37.247]  All natural ingredients.
[02:10:37.567 --> 02:10:37.727]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[02:10:37.747 --> 02:10:37.948]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[02:10:50.652 --> 02:10:53.013]  Cyrus Jones lived to be 103.
[02:10:53.053 --> 02:10:56.614]  When you're just a little kid, 103's forever.
[02:10:57.914 --> 02:11:01.595]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913.
[02:11:02.936 --> 02:11:09.317]  Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[02:11:09.357 --> 02:11:12.678]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[02:11:13.739 --> 02:11:17.600]  So, Cyrus Jones lived forever.
[02:11:20.747 --> 02:11:26.312]  When you dig my grave, will you make it shallow?
[02:11:30.035 --> 02:11:39.983]  German defense ministers, Willie Nelson, Governor Ventura, architects, engineers, scientists, they've all come out and said it's an inside job.
[02:11:42.568 --> 02:11:43.649]  They're not going to stop us.
[02:11:44.269 --> 02:11:45.289]  This song's for you, Mark.
[02:11:45.329 --> 02:11:46.490]  We're all going to die someday.
[02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:51.033]  No one down in history will be remembered for standing up for the little guy.
[02:11:51.113 --> 02:11:51.893]  Grave Digger.
[02:11:52.013 --> 02:11:57.576]  The political system of the New World Order is going to be destroyed.
[02:12:11.781 --> 02:12:16.724]  I want to hold Mark five minutes over to the next hour, then we have a Dave Edwards about domestic death squads.
[02:12:17.224 --> 02:12:21.186]  Jesse Benton in the last 15, so the fourth hour will be totally jam-packed.
[02:12:22.667 --> 02:12:23.888]  Now let's play this little part.
[02:12:24.328 --> 02:12:25.649]  The New World Order is scared of dying.
[02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:26.049]  We're not.
[02:12:26.649 --> 02:12:27.150]  We're committed.
[02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:31.132]  We're going to live as long as we can.
[02:12:31.612 --> 02:12:32.132]  We're committed.
[02:12:34.534 --> 02:12:36.455]  Doesn't matter what you do, we're not going to shut up.
[02:12:36.495 --> 02:12:37.515]  We've had enough of your murder.
[02:12:38.035 --> 02:12:38.776]  Enough of your crime.
[02:12:42.088 --> 02:12:44.268]  Enough of you destroying our name.
[02:12:47.989 --> 02:12:49.009]  You know we're going to beat you.
[02:12:49.049 --> 02:12:52.530]  This isn't like past things in the last 50 years.
[02:12:53.010 --> 02:12:54.151]  Movements you can control.
[02:12:54.171 --> 02:12:56.711]  You're not going to stop us.
[02:12:57.051 --> 02:13:01.592]  People are going to be part of history.
[02:13:01.912 --> 02:13:02.792]  Part of bringing you down.
[02:13:11.730 --> 02:13:13.332]  We'll be remembered.
[02:13:31.556 --> 02:13:34.037]  All the torture, all the stages there.
[02:13:34.198 --> 02:13:36.458]  It's all coming out.
[02:13:36.478 --> 02:13:41.521]  I can feel the rain.
[02:13:42.041 --> 02:13:44.202]  Let's go back to Mark Dice.
[02:13:44.262 --> 02:13:48.503]  Mark, give us the numbers to his syndicator.
[02:13:48.563 --> 02:13:50.904]  Give us the numbers to the FCC.
[02:13:50.964 --> 02:13:52.205]  Give us the numbers, Mark Dice.
[02:13:52.585 --> 02:13:53.245]  Death-threaded.
[02:13:53.285 --> 02:13:56.647]  His syndicator is RadioAmerica.org.
[02:13:57.087 --> 02:13:58.187]  The phone number is 703.
[02:14:01.144 --> 02:14:02.525]  Give the number out again!
[02:14:13.559 --> 02:14:17.141]  One thousand, also available on markdice.com.
[02:14:17.201 --> 02:14:18.582]  Let me stop you because we're going to hold you over.
[02:14:19.662 --> 02:14:24.424]  You need to go, it'll probably only cost you three or four thousand if you need the money and I'll spot it to you because I know you're broke, Mark.
[02:14:24.464 --> 02:14:32.008]  You need to get an injunction filed in your local state or federal court against further death threats and further solicitation to murder.
[02:14:32.188 --> 02:14:34.429]  Any judge, you bring that before and play it.
[02:14:34.869 --> 02:14:37.291]  Under rules of evidence, we'll put an injunction on him.
[02:14:37.591 --> 02:14:41.533]  That will then get the news and then pressure will be brought and we can get this guy fired.
[02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:41.893]  Go ahead.
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:54.728]  Also, the FCC's phone number, 1-888-CALL-F-C-C, 1-888-C-A-L-L-F-C-C.
[02:14:54.868 --> 02:15:04.935]  You can also go to fcc.gov and email a complaint in with the audio link and the date of the broadcast as well.
[02:15:05.055 --> 02:15:06.176]  And when is that crediting on?
[02:15:06.376 --> 02:15:07.597]  He's on in a few hours, isn't he?
[02:15:08.507 --> 02:15:10.768]  I think he's on in about three hours.
[02:15:11.028 --> 02:15:16.409]  Yeah, we need everybody to call into the show, act like stupid neocons or dumb liberals and you can get on.
[02:15:16.649 --> 02:15:18.329]  We're not dumb liberals or dumb neocons.
[02:15:18.349 --> 02:15:19.190]  We're Americans.
[02:15:19.450 --> 02:15:20.690]  Defenders of the Republic.
[02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:22.890]  Mark Dice, back in 60 seconds.
[02:15:27.532 --> 02:15:28.872]  Let me talk to Mark.
[02:15:28.892 --> 02:15:30.112]  We'll just keep going during this break.
[02:15:30.432 --> 02:15:30.712]  Mark?
[02:15:31.293 --> 02:15:31.633]  One second.
[02:15:32.953 --> 02:15:33.193]  Go ahead.
[02:15:35.289 --> 02:15:36.991]  Mark, we're going to be back in 60 seconds.
[02:15:37.011 --> 02:15:38.232]  You can stay five more minutes, right?
[02:15:38.612 --> 02:15:38.792]  Sure.
[02:15:39.393 --> 02:15:42.976]  Alright, I want to get you on the Sunday radio show to recap this.
[02:15:43.036 --> 02:15:49.582]  I want to get We Are Change Canada and We Are Change Denver on.
[02:15:49.602 --> 02:15:51.264]  I mean, they're running in arresting everybody now.
[02:15:51.284 --> 02:15:53.846]  You come out and hold out a hand out a DVD on the road, they just come.
[02:15:54.567 --> 02:15:55.088]  I mean, they are.
[02:15:55.128 --> 02:15:55.928]  They know we're hurting them.
[02:15:55.948 --> 02:15:57.590]  They know the terrorists know we're going to get them.
[02:15:58.547 --> 02:16:00.608]  Yeah, you know, this isn't going to cause us to back down.
[02:16:00.628 --> 02:16:01.889]  I don't know what they think we're going to do.
[02:16:01.929 --> 02:16:02.829]  This is only going to energize us.
[02:16:02.869 --> 02:16:06.091]  No, no, whenever I'm burned out and tired, this type of stuff just totally energizes.
[02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:07.592]  You threaten my family, just boom!
[02:16:07.992 --> 02:16:09.472]  Oh yeah, I'm totally juiced right now.
[02:16:09.553 --> 02:16:16.856]  I could go, I don't know what they're expecting we're going to do with this other than just retaliate with more information and even more of a drive.
[02:16:17.236 --> 02:16:19.978]  Well, they're cowards, so they operate according to how a coward would work.
[02:16:20.458 --> 02:16:22.279]  Understand government and criminals watching.
[02:16:22.559 --> 02:16:23.860]  You are not the legitimate government.
[02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:25.581]  We are committed.
[02:16:26.201 --> 02:16:27.281]  Mark, you want to talk about commitment?
[02:16:28.002 --> 02:16:28.162]  Yeah.
[02:16:29.369 --> 02:16:30.330]  Yeah, we're still on the air right now?
[02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:33.492]  Yeah, we're on the internet, and this is going over my internet streams too, right?
[02:16:33.512 --> 02:16:34.032]  Not just the video.
[02:16:34.052 --> 02:16:35.273]  Yeah, we're going to come back right now, Mark.
[02:16:35.293 --> 02:16:36.174]  Let's talk about commitment.
[02:16:36.214 --> 02:16:36.994]  Give out those numbers.
[02:16:38.155 --> 02:16:40.837]  But bottom line, you need to get an injunction now.
[02:16:41.837 --> 02:16:42.138]  Okay?
[02:16:42.178 --> 02:16:50.763]  You need an injunction against further terroristic threats and the calls to commit capital murder, the contracting to commit capital murder.
[02:16:51.124 --> 02:16:58.508]  And you need to call that FBI agent back and say he is criminally liable if he doesn't do this complaint and he doesn't go arrest that piece of crap right now.
[02:16:58.569 --> 02:16:58.869]  Here we go.
[02:16:59.309 --> 02:16:59.394]  Yeah.
[02:17:05.458 --> 02:17:17.288]  Mark Dyson, you're going to give those numbers out again to the FCC, the website, going to give out the number for the syndicator, for this troll, this fake conservative, this piece of trash, Michael Reagan, who's there to pacify conservatives until they get their new world order in.
[02:17:18.409 --> 02:17:21.391]  Same corporate genders that own him, own Obama, own Hillary, own them all.
[02:17:21.751 --> 02:17:22.172]  McCain.
[02:17:23.313 --> 02:17:24.073]  Commitment, Mark.
[02:17:24.093 --> 02:17:30.379]  We were talking during the break, to PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, they could see it, and internet streamlisters at Infowars.com, for the MNFM audience.
[02:17:30.959 --> 02:17:31.419]  Commitment.
[02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:34.302]  Does this scare you off, or does this make you commit more?
[02:17:35.188 --> 02:17:36.849]  This is very energizing for me.
[02:17:37.090 --> 02:17:43.414]  I've known the consequences of this for quite some time, and I don't know what they think that I'm going to do other than become more energized.
[02:17:43.434 --> 02:17:46.257]  I have so much adrenaline pumping through my system.
[02:17:46.277 --> 02:17:47.838]  I've been contacting so many people.
[02:17:47.858 --> 02:17:48.779]  I'm just going to go even further.
[02:17:49.599 --> 02:17:54.163]  And I'm perfectly able and willing to defend myself, and I'm not afraid to die.
[02:17:54.882 --> 02:18:00.264]  If I die, if I'm murdered, then my soul is then freed, and everybody else can just continue to work.
[02:18:00.604 --> 02:18:03.885]  And again, I have contingency plans for information outreach.
[02:18:03.945 --> 02:18:07.426]  If that were to happen, people will be contacting the appropriate individuals.
[02:18:07.446 --> 02:18:08.727]  Alex, you're top on that list.
[02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:23.852]  And so I just want these people to know that I don't know what they think that they're going to accomplish by doing this, other than making themselves look completely more criminal and dig their own hole that they're going to be lying in, just wondering what it is that they've
[02:18:24.557 --> 02:18:27.038]  They've done calling for these criminal activities here.
[02:18:28.759 --> 02:18:29.479]  His phone number.
[02:18:29.919 --> 02:18:32.160]  The syndication company is Radio America.
[02:18:32.761 --> 02:18:34.261]  RadioAmerica.org.
[02:18:34.741 --> 02:18:35.322]  The number is 703-302-1000.
[02:18:41.286 --> 02:18:43.467]  And in the complaint, say it was on Tuesday.
[02:18:43.507 --> 02:18:45.248]  This information is on my site as well.
[02:18:45.908 --> 02:18:50.411]  The death threat was made Tuesday, June 10th during the second hour and we have audio of that.
[02:18:51.271 --> 02:18:53.272]  Not just a death threat, not just a terroristic threat.
[02:18:53.612 --> 02:19:01.936]  He publicly contracted services for a premeditated capital murder of Mark Dice.
[02:19:02.937 --> 02:19:07.499]  Wanting to pay for the bullet and mentioning it three times that he thinks that I should be murdered.
[02:19:08.264 --> 02:19:11.807]  The FCC's number is 1-800-CALL-FCC.
[02:19:12.288 --> 02:19:16.752]  And again, please, go to my site, get the press release, and email it out to all the news agencies.
[02:19:16.772 --> 02:19:18.193]  Let's get everybody talking about it.
[02:19:18.213 --> 02:19:23.037]  Yeah, it's up on InfoWars.com, MarkDice.com, The Resistance Manifesto.com.
[02:19:23.277 --> 02:19:26.000]  Were you able to dig up this little troll's radio show number?
[02:19:27.170 --> 02:19:28.750]  I haven't done that yet, I've been too busy.
[02:19:28.770 --> 02:19:31.911]  I'm sure you can go to reagan.com and check it out and you get the times there.
[02:19:31.931 --> 02:19:34.712]  You can probably stream the show and again, feed the screen.
[02:19:34.872 --> 02:19:36.613]  Look, they've hired domestic death squads.
[02:19:36.633 --> 02:19:37.853]  We're talking about that next.
[02:19:38.193 --> 02:19:39.154]  They are desperate.
[02:19:39.194 --> 02:19:40.914]  The New World Order is desperate.
[02:19:40.934 --> 02:19:43.755]  They want to do here what they did in Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador.
[02:19:44.055 --> 02:19:45.335]  And it's not going to happen, bastards.
[02:19:45.495 --> 02:19:47.076]  This is home of the free, land of the brave.
[02:19:47.536 --> 02:19:48.096]  You understand?
[02:19:48.616 --> 02:19:50.217]  Anybody that's getting involved or that's
[02:19:51.010 --> 02:19:58.539]  Thinking about getting involved, and if they're afraid that something like this is going to happen to them, I want to urge you to not be afraid to just continue on the course of action.
[02:19:58.999 --> 02:20:08.130]  Jesus said that the greatest thing that a man can do is to lay his life down for his fellow man, and that's what they want you to do is to be afraid so that you won't take action.
[02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.911]  I'm good.
[02:20:22.301 --> 02:20:30.451]  There's other individuals that are going to expose them, that are going to continue the movement, and let's just use this as a reason to energize and to increase our efforts.
[02:20:30.491 --> 02:20:35.417]  And again, I want to urge everybody to start emailing the troops and sending the troops more DVDs.
[02:20:35.537 --> 02:20:42.285]  Yeah, let's not forget, their death threat, their contracting for murder on national radio, it is only going to blow up in their face, everybody.
[02:20:42.685 --> 02:20:46.509]  In fact, I'm so busy I wasn't going to do it myself, but we're going to mail the troops some packages here.
[02:20:47.170 --> 02:20:48.751]  And that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:48.952 --> 02:20:49.732]  We are not going to stop.
[02:20:49.773 --> 02:20:51.294]  All the details at MarkDice.com.
[02:20:51.614 --> 02:20:53.597]  Mark, let my producer call you right now.
[02:20:54.037 --> 02:20:56.580]  I want to talk to you this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:02.606]  We've got the live show, the Sunday abbreviated edition of the 4-hour weekday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:21:02.646 --> 02:21:02.966]  Central.
[02:21:02.986 --> 02:21:03.847]  I want to have you on.
[02:21:04.688 --> 02:21:05.309]  The show.
[02:21:06.051 --> 02:21:11.701]  This is just absolutely incredible and we'll be talking to you on Sunday and we're all going to be praying for you, Mark.
[02:21:11.721 --> 02:21:12.582]  We appreciate your courage.
[02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:13.790]  Thank you.
[02:21:13.810 --> 02:21:16.991]  And Michael Reagan said, if you've got a problem with it, deal with it.
[02:21:17.131 --> 02:21:18.212]  So we're dealing with it.
[02:21:18.592 --> 02:21:19.452]  Yeah, we're going to deal with him.
[02:21:20.173 --> 02:21:23.294]  He's going to get civilly sued and he's probably going to go to prison.
[02:21:23.614 --> 02:21:26.515]  He has contracted for murder in front of everyone.
[02:21:26.915 --> 02:21:28.196]  Committed an incredible crime.
[02:21:28.236 --> 02:21:31.817]  We need injunctions now to stop further murder, calls for murder.
[02:21:32.337 --> 02:21:36.519]  The person that may try to murder Mark Dice or anybody else is going to be listening the next time he does it.
[02:21:36.899 --> 02:21:37.899]  This is a clear danger.
[02:21:37.959 --> 02:21:40.760]  He must be injuncted now from further crimes.
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.101]  Mark Dice, stay right there.
[02:21:47.201 --> 02:21:50.364]  John, do you have the next guest?
[02:21:50.524 --> 02:21:51.405]  I sure do, he's all set.
[02:21:51.445 --> 02:21:53.287]  Alright, let me say bye to Mark Dice right now.
[02:21:53.687 --> 02:21:56.310]  We're going to keep this discussion going as we get into Death Squads next.
[02:21:57.551 --> 02:22:00.594]  Mr. Edwards, thank you for coming on with us.
[02:22:00.894 --> 02:22:02.276]  Get Edwards on here with Dice right now.
[02:22:03.724 --> 02:22:04.465]  Punch them both up.
[02:22:04.625 --> 02:22:05.085]  Can you do that?
[02:22:05.105 --> 02:22:05.945]  Give me a second.
[02:22:05.965 --> 02:22:06.306]  Give me a second.
[02:22:06.566 --> 02:22:08.067]  Mark, we're here with you.
[02:22:08.087 --> 02:22:09.267]  This is very serious.
[02:22:09.548 --> 02:22:16.872]  This shows a whole new opening up in their war front against us because they realize we have the attack pattern in the info war that's going to bring them to justice.
[02:22:16.912 --> 02:22:20.034]  So you need to watch your hind end right now.
[02:22:20.254 --> 02:22:20.534]  He's there.
[02:22:21.434 --> 02:22:22.875]  Like I said, I'm trained in martial arts.
[02:22:22.955 --> 02:22:25.877]  I work out several times a week, up to five, six days a week.
[02:22:25.897 --> 02:22:29.319]  Tell the listeners here the specific death threats that this has already generated.
[02:22:30.561 --> 02:22:32.583]  Oh my God, I can't even tell you how many I've gotten.
[02:22:32.643 --> 02:22:37.026]  People wanting to come and find me, to do very bad things to me.
[02:22:37.046 --> 02:22:41.930]  And I mean, not only just kill me, but just, I don't know how they come up with some of these disgusting things that they want to do.
[02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:42.650]  Well, they do it in Iraq.
[02:22:42.691 --> 02:22:45.833]  They do it, raping children, ripping testicles off with pliers.
[02:22:45.913 --> 02:22:46.133]  I think?
[02:23:06.986 --> 02:23:09.749]  And with the death threats you've been getting, I want to talk to David Edwards.
[02:23:09.769 --> 02:23:10.829]  We're not on the main show yet.
[02:23:10.849 --> 02:23:11.990]  We're on the TV program right now.
[02:23:13.292 --> 02:23:14.853]  David Edwards, of course, is an academic.
[02:23:15.613 --> 02:23:17.575]  He's written books on the subject.
[02:23:17.595 --> 02:23:25.482]  He's writing a book right now with one of the top experts on death squads and the New World Order, Peter Dale Scott, professor, award-winning author and professor.
[02:23:25.502 --> 02:23:30.146]  Are you hearing that Michael Reagan called for the murder of Mark Dyson, contracted murder on the air?
[02:23:32.168 --> 02:23:35.929]  Yes, I've been listening and watching the show this morning, Alex.
[02:23:36.289 --> 02:23:37.089]  What do you think of this?
[02:23:41.050 --> 02:23:42.671]  Well, it certainly fits the pattern.
[02:23:43.691 --> 02:23:49.853]  Obviously, Mr. Reagan is part of a... A criminal group.
[02:23:51.193 --> 02:23:55.634]  Of a complex of private security firms and connected to the renegade
[02:23:59.642 --> 02:24:02.124]  Military intelligence system, yeah.
[02:24:02.204 --> 02:24:04.125]  And I'm sick of them saying they do this for America.
[02:24:04.285 --> 02:24:05.526]  They're destroying the country.
[02:24:05.807 --> 02:24:06.607]  Everybody knows it.
[02:24:06.907 --> 02:24:07.588]  We're sick of them.
[02:24:07.628 --> 02:24:07.948]  Stay there.
[02:24:07.968 --> 02:24:09.289]  We're coming back to you right now, okay?
[02:24:09.829 --> 02:24:11.971]  Main transmission in T-minus 30 seconds.
[02:24:14.193 --> 02:24:17.935]  Two teaspoons daily boost natural immunity without drug toxicity.
[02:24:18.336 --> 02:24:19.256]  That's still there, right?
[02:24:19.476 --> 02:24:21.558]  Oxygen and silver in a new... Everyone's still there.
[02:24:22.273 --> 02:24:27.517]  The supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds, flus, cancers and more.
[02:24:27.837 --> 02:24:33.861]  Build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely and inexpensively with OxySilver.
[02:24:34.242 --> 02:24:36.243]  Order your supply now by calling toll free 1-877-817-9829.
[02:24:36.263 --> 02:24:36.823]  That's 1-877-817-9829.
[02:24:36.843 --> 02:24:37.164]  Do it now!
[02:24:46.562 --> 02:24:48.744]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:24:49.344 --> 02:24:52.207]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:57.371 --> 02:24:59.793]  Jesse Benton with the latest Ron Paul campaign news.
[02:24:59.813 --> 02:25:01.295]  The last 15 minutes of the show.
[02:25:02.536 --> 02:25:05.618]  I'm going to have the gentleman we're about to talk to back up in the near future.
[02:25:05.638 --> 02:25:08.461]  30 minutes, 35 minutes is not enough with him.
[02:25:09.662 --> 02:25:10.743]  He's David Edwards.
[02:25:12.250 --> 02:25:17.171]  Works with David Ray Griffin, works with Peter Dale Scott, writing a book with him right now about death squads and more.
[02:25:17.531 --> 02:25:18.051]  This fits in.
[02:25:18.072 --> 02:25:20.872]  We were talking about domestic death squads, the private security firms.
[02:25:21.312 --> 02:25:23.573]  They run the red light cameras, the surveillance cameras.
[02:25:23.633 --> 02:25:27.234]  It's the military industrial complex, foreign-ly owned, coming and taking over.
[02:25:27.694 --> 02:25:31.175]  But I want to play again from right when he's making the death threat, about 30 seconds in.
[02:25:31.435 --> 02:25:36.396]  This is Michael Reagan, ninth largest talk show host rated by talkers, four million listeners per day.
[02:25:36.736 --> 02:25:38.897]  In his second hour, it's on all over Texas.
[02:25:39.557 --> 02:25:53.426]  You can hear him on three stations that come into Austin, calling for, calling for murder, calling, contracting for murder, calling for people to kill, saying he will pay for it, and calling for the murder of anyone that gives 9-11 truth information to the troops.
[02:25:53.486 --> 02:25:59.450]  Let's play this vicious, unprecedented, 1939-style intimidation.
[02:25:59.490 --> 02:26:02.833]  The exact same kind of stuff they did in Germany to shut up the opposition.
[02:26:03.013 --> 02:26:05.875]  This is pure evil, and we're only going to the next level.
[02:26:05.895 --> 02:26:07.296]  You threaten my family, it's been happening.
[02:26:07.556 --> 02:26:08.877]  Threaten my wife, you bastards.
[02:26:08.937 --> 02:26:09.177]  Listen.
[02:26:10.217 --> 02:26:21.365]  Listen, I don't know about you, but down here in Texas, folks, my family didn't fight at San Jacinto, and didn't raise Colonel Travis's son, and didn't go through everything we went through to be a bunch of cowards, and Americans aren't made of cowardly stuff.
[02:26:21.605 --> 02:26:26.768]  You've mesmerized us, you've got us into your false left-right paradigm, you put everybody to sleep, but they're waking up now.
[02:26:27.189 --> 02:26:28.049]  And people don't like it.
[02:26:28.069 --> 02:26:29.050]  They don't like your tyranny.
[02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:30.291]  They're not scared of you.
[02:26:31.519 --> 02:26:35.261]  We're still made of the right stuff, ladies and gentlemen, and you're going to go to prison, all of you.
[02:26:35.702 --> 02:26:37.323]  You're just going to keep pushing and pushing.
[02:26:37.403 --> 02:26:39.404]  Let's play the serious crime.
[02:26:40.365 --> 02:26:43.827]  We've got to find the people who are doing this, take them out, and shoot them.
[02:26:46.068 --> 02:26:46.308]  Really.
[02:26:46.829 --> 02:26:55.714]  Just find the people who are sending those letters to our troops, to demoralize our troops and do what they're doing, you take them out, they are traitors to this country, and shoot them.
[02:26:56.995 --> 02:26:57.935]  You have a problem with that?
[02:26:58.296 --> 02:26:58.776]  Deal with it.
[02:27:00.194 --> 02:27:03.855]  But anybody who would do that doesn't deserve to live.
[02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:08.896]  You shoot them, you call them traitors, that's what they are, and you shoot them dead.
[02:27:10.736 --> 02:27:11.576]  I'll pay for the bullet.
[02:27:13.777 --> 02:27:20.858]  Mark Dice, the founder of the Resistance, which he calls a media watchdog group, says that the U.S.
[02:27:20.878 --> 02:27:25.779]  government was responsible for the September 11th terrorist attacks and that the armed forces should know it.
[02:27:26.778 --> 02:27:27.818]  People want the facts.
[02:27:28.479 --> 02:27:30.240]  The Marines are hungry for the truth.
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:31.880]  What got them there in Iraq?
[02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:34.481]  Why are they risking their lives?
[02:27:34.761 --> 02:27:36.822]  And we're going to help them understand that.
[02:27:38.043 --> 02:27:48.807]  So he's going to send letters and declassified government documents that he says can prove the government's responsibility for the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.
[02:27:49.028 --> 02:27:50.848]  And he's urging others to do the same.
[02:27:52.129 --> 02:27:54.570]  Now, Captain Pete Hegseth.
[02:27:55.442 --> 02:27:57.164]  Executive Director of Vets for Freedom.
[02:27:57.605 --> 02:27:58.926]  You ought to get him on too, Brett.
[02:27:59.427 --> 02:27:59.807]  I'm on it.
[02:28:00.608 --> 02:28:10.659]  He says, you know something, these are going to end up in the trash, or they're going to end up in the toilet, or they're going to end up on the firing range.
[02:28:11.596 --> 02:28:16.039]  How about you take Mark Dice out and put him in the middle of the firing range.
[02:28:16.499 --> 02:28:22.403]  Tie him to a post, don't blindfold him, let it rip and have some fun with Mark Dice.
[02:28:22.863 --> 02:28:25.564]  These people are just folks, I'm telling you, outrageous.
[02:28:26.165 --> 02:28:28.306]  Now we know where the Ron Paul supporters went.
[02:28:28.346 --> 02:28:29.367]  That's enough of this bastard.
[02:28:31.061 --> 02:28:33.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a big deal.
[02:28:33.163 --> 02:28:44.375]  You need to tell everybody this weekend to go to MarkDice.com, InfoWars.com, get the story, get the link, call every government agency, because if they can get away with this, this is part of a program they follow in countries.
[02:28:44.956 --> 02:28:47.638]  They got 30% of the population that will do anything they say.
[02:28:48.099 --> 02:28:51.943]  That's going to be the ruling class, the ruling death squad enforcers.
[02:28:51.963 --> 02:28:53.444]  We're going to go to Mark Dice in just a moment.
[02:28:54.305 --> 02:28:55.506]  We're going to let him go in a second.
[02:28:55.526 --> 02:29:05.956]  I want him to talk about the death threats he's getting as a result of this, but I wanted to go to David Edwards, an expert on death squads, co-authoring a book right now on the subject, and he is an academic.
[02:29:06.776 --> 02:29:09.899]  He has been all over the world reporting on this, seeing it first hand.
[02:29:11.341 --> 02:29:15.284]  I just had you on for about ten minutes a few days ago, what, Tuesday, the day he did this?
[02:29:15.304 --> 02:29:16.785]  We're learning about it two days, three days later.
[02:29:17.426 --> 02:29:24.712]  We were talking about how they're going to unleash death squads, how they're calling for our death on TV, saying 9-11 truthers need to be tortured, tased, go to secret prisons.
[02:29:25.373 --> 02:29:30.397]  This is a guy who admittedly gets talking points from the White House, New York Times, he goes there and gets orders.
[02:29:30.877 --> 02:29:32.258]  This is directly from the White House.
[02:29:32.278 --> 02:29:36.922]  We have Congress having hearings showing 9-11 truth, architects and engineers saying they're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:29:38.603 --> 02:29:43.227]  What does this mean to you to see this happening, David Edwards, as an academic who's been studying this for decades?
[02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:46.330]  Well, Barry, this is really
[02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:48.341]  Close to the bone for me.
[02:29:49.262 --> 02:30:04.595]  While I was teaching in the University of Maryland system, I'm an expert in the Indian region, and I speak some of the Indian languages in that region.
[02:30:05.716 --> 02:30:15.144]  And while I was teaching in the University of Maryland system, I was setting up language training courses for anthropology students in those languages.
[02:30:16.568 --> 02:30:26.776]  And, um, was approached by one of these private security firms that provides linguistic and other sorts of services to the Pentagon.
[02:30:28.076 --> 02:30:38.964]  And they recruited, you know, attempted to, uh, tempt me to, uh, work for them, um, and set up a Quechua language training program.
[02:30:38.984 --> 02:30:45.329]  Quechua is the Incan language, uh, for, uh, appeared special forces and that type of
[02:30:46.693 --> 02:30:55.975]  They were very interested, it appeared, to get back into Bolivia and overthrow the first Indian President elected to the Bolivian Presidency.
[02:30:58.116 --> 02:31:00.276]  I, of course, refused to work with them.
[02:31:01.997 --> 02:31:07.018]  I got information through channels to Abel Morales, the Bolivian President.
[02:31:09.439 --> 02:31:12.699]  Right after that, I had one of my cars.
[02:31:13.140 --> 02:31:14.680]  I lived in Annapolis, Maryland.
[02:31:15.322 --> 02:31:29.472]  I was right in the heart of this system and someone literally picked up and wrapped one of my vehicles around the tree in front of my house and then I endured for several days.
[02:31:29.512 --> 02:31:40.640]  I had to commute long distances to the college where I was teaching and I had Maryland State Troopers escort me the entire 80 miles one way.
[02:31:42.603 --> 02:31:53.726]  uh... when i was going to work and they made a very clear uh... presentation of the fact that uh... people very high up were very irritated that i had transmitted that information.
[02:31:53.766 --> 02:31:56.007]  Well, I want you to tell that story after Mark leaves.
[02:31:56.047 --> 02:31:56.687]  He's got to go.
[02:31:56.727 --> 02:31:59.148]  That's why you're here to go over this network.
[02:31:59.328 --> 02:32:03.229]  They've taken over hundreds of countries and black ops are just deciding to do it here.
[02:32:03.309 --> 02:32:09.451]  What does it mean when a White House operative like Michael Reagan calls openly and contracts for Mark Dice's murder?
[02:32:10.412 --> 02:32:11.512]  Well, well, that's
[02:32:13.174 --> 02:32:18.978]  They know, Alex, that this information is going to come right across your radar screen.
[02:32:19.819 --> 02:32:24.102]  And basically what they're saying is, they're not only telling Mark, but they're telling you something.
[02:32:25.243 --> 02:32:28.085]  And I... Oh, they already told me with phone calls this week, believe me.
[02:32:29.607 --> 02:32:33.289]  So, I think that's what you need to really pay attention to.
[02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:34.590]  Who do they think we are?
[02:32:34.771 --> 02:32:35.952]  I'm not going to stop!
[02:32:36.972 --> 02:32:37.212]  Ever!
[02:32:37.233 --> 02:32:40.075]  Yes, and I think that's very obvious to them as well.
[02:32:40.175 --> 02:32:42.877]  And basically what they're... They're not trying to intimidate you.
[02:32:43.322 --> 02:32:46.764]  They're basically telling you that they've been given the green light.
[02:32:49.866 --> 02:32:50.086]  Yeah.
[02:32:50.526 --> 02:32:51.127]  Well, that's it.
[02:32:51.167 --> 02:32:51.807]  That's the way it is.
[02:32:53.408 --> 02:32:54.209]  God, they're scum.
[02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:57.131]  I just can't believe they're doing it to this country so their buddies can suck it dry.
[02:32:57.171 --> 02:32:58.091]  Mark Dice comments.
[02:32:59.512 --> 02:33:03.735]  Yeah, I just want to thank them if they ever do release me from this
[02:33:04.855 --> 02:33:10.839]  Earthly, plain, and then I just want everybody else to just continue to fight and get the word out, and again, don't be scared.
[02:33:10.859 --> 02:33:11.920]  That's what they want everybody to do.
[02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:12.560]  I'm not scared.
[02:33:12.941 --> 02:33:13.981]  Don't let it scare you, listeners.
[02:33:14.201 --> 02:33:15.022]  It means we're beating them.
[02:33:15.442 --> 02:33:16.403]  They can't stop us all.
[02:33:17.243 --> 02:33:18.444]  No, this is energizing.
[02:33:18.504 --> 02:33:19.925]  It's very disturbing.
[02:33:21.126 --> 02:33:23.228]  And it confirms everything we know about this scum.
[02:33:24.729 --> 02:33:28.051]  Yeah, you know, we're the ones that really care about this country.
[02:33:28.091 --> 02:33:30.172]  We're the ones that are upholding the Constitution.
[02:33:30.232 --> 02:33:31.173]  These are the Nazis.
[02:33:31.233 --> 02:33:31.893]  These are the terrorists.
[02:33:31.913 --> 02:33:34.155]  This just absolutely proves beyond a doubt
[02:33:35.230 --> 02:33:42.213]  These are the terrorists, and it's going to be interesting to see if the mainstream media picks this up, or if there's going to be a total blackout on this.
[02:33:44.613 --> 02:33:51.816]  Well, I know going into the belly of the beast in Virginia and Maryland and D.C., having them come right up to me and say, you plan to do something violent?
[02:33:52.136 --> 02:33:53.016]  Want to do something violent?
[02:33:53.076 --> 02:33:55.797]  Photographing us, we'd videotape them, they'd put clown masks on.
[02:33:55.817 --> 02:33:59.218]  I mean, that's what our country's turned into, being followed by guys in clown masks.
[02:33:59.278 --> 02:34:01.059]  I mean, it's just...
[02:34:02.632 --> 02:34:03.732]  It's just so incredible.
[02:34:04.193 --> 02:34:06.614]  Folks, they're going to take all your pension funds, everything.
[02:34:06.634 --> 02:34:07.394]  That's what this is about.
[02:34:07.454 --> 02:34:20.018]  They are going to... Explain to them, David Edwards studying this and teaching, you know, as a professor at graduate level on this, what is it like to know that they're doing here what they did in all these third world countries.
[02:34:20.259 --> 02:34:21.279]  That they're really going to do it.
[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:31.883]  Well, I think, and please let me know when you've got a time sensitivity, but the book that
[02:34:32.978 --> 02:34:38.901]  The book that Peter and I are writing about really does go back to the literal belly of the beast.
[02:34:40.241 --> 02:34:54.988]  During those last days of World War II and Allen Dulles recruiting, Gestapo SS, Storm Troopers, you know, the worst sort of war criminals, and not just a few, but literally tens of thousands
[02:34:55.951 --> 02:34:57.872]  of Nazi troops.
[02:34:57.952 --> 02:35:05.596]  My uncle was in Vietnam and would see the sons of famous four-star Nazi generals in his command in the army, but go ahead.
[02:35:05.817 --> 02:35:07.157]  Well, that's absolutely right.
[02:35:07.197 --> 02:35:18.404]  You had torturers, Nazi torturers literally, Nazi torturers training US troops, Green Beret troops in Operation Phoenix, and we also
[02:35:20.043 --> 02:35:25.890]  We're going to be looking at the Office of Public Safety, operating at the CIA front.
[02:35:25.950 --> 02:35:26.550]  We'll stay there.
[02:35:26.571 --> 02:35:28.092]  We're going to say bye to Mark Dice now.
[02:35:28.112 --> 02:35:30.735]  We're going to come back for a couple of segments with you and go over this.
[02:35:30.755 --> 02:35:32.497]  We're going to have you back on again in the near future.
[02:35:32.778 --> 02:35:38.044]  This just broke in the middle of it, and it just so happens you're a Death Squad expert, one of the top ones, and here we are dealing with it.
[02:35:38.865 --> 02:35:39.726]  Mark, good job.
[02:35:40.226 --> 02:35:41.666]  Upsetting the enemy with your great idea.
[02:35:41.686 --> 02:35:43.287]  It shows it's an effective attack pattern.
[02:35:43.687 --> 02:35:45.707]  No one's going to stop anybody from getting this out.
[02:35:45.967 --> 02:35:47.507]  This is an attempt to intimidate everybody.
[02:35:47.527 --> 02:35:48.448]  It doesn't intimidate us.
[02:35:48.828 --> 02:35:50.588]  In closing, give out those phone numbers again.
[02:35:51.968 --> 02:35:58.869]  Contact the FCC at 1-888-CALL-FCC.
[02:35:59.390 --> 02:36:01.410]  You can also go to my site and email them.
[02:36:02.050 --> 02:36:05.511]  And again, try to include the date and the broadcast hour of the show.
[02:36:05.531 --> 02:36:07.411]  Of course, the host's name.
[02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:17.426]  You can contact Michael's syndicator at 703-302-1000 and please get the press release out to the mainstream media.
[02:36:17.446 --> 02:36:18.467]  Let's send a message to them.
[02:36:21.013 --> 02:36:24.116]  And I don't think that these fools know that I know how the media works.
[02:36:24.336 --> 02:36:25.658]  I know how to slip through the cracks.
[02:36:25.838 --> 02:36:27.920]  I know how to find out when they're asleep at the switch.
[02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:29.021]  Mark, Mark, stay there.
[02:36:29.061 --> 02:36:34.867]  We're going to go ahead and just do, for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars stream listeners, this is so important and life-threatening.
[02:36:35.127 --> 02:36:37.769]  We're going to cover these four minutes with you right now and our guests.
[02:36:37.789 --> 02:36:43.735]  Then we're going to let you go in about three minutes and exclusively talk to the academic we have on covering the death squad.
[02:36:43.755 --> 02:36:44.156]  Stay with us.
[02:36:46.767 --> 02:36:50.668]  Okay, I want to go back to David Edwards.
[02:36:50.688 --> 02:36:53.829]  David, from studying these criminals, I don't care if they've given a green light.
[02:36:53.869 --> 02:36:55.669]  And yeah, calling up threatening to go after my family.
[02:36:55.689 --> 02:37:00.870]  I mean, first it's saying I got a lady pregnant and trying to scare my wife with that, which she knew was bull.
[02:37:01.731 --> 02:37:04.271]  And then bringing up my kids.
[02:37:04.911 --> 02:37:05.932]  God, they're evil, man.
[02:37:06.692 --> 02:37:12.713]  And I've said, they're breaking all the rules of war here, but I guess they did that with their death squads in Latin America, didn't they?
[02:37:13.894 --> 02:37:14.854]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:37:16.876 --> 02:37:31.762]  What you're talking about when you're talking about the death squads in Latin America are literally death squad commandos and torture squad commandos who were literally trained in torture techniques by S.S.
[02:37:31.823 --> 02:37:38.085]  Gustavo, the worst type of Joseph Mengele type of torturers and murderers.
[02:37:38.245 --> 02:37:39.806]  Yeah, Klaus Barmy even helped!
[02:37:40.834 --> 02:37:42.234]  Well, that's absolutely right.
[02:37:43.114 --> 02:37:59.018]  I live... By the way, my grandfather in Midland, Texas saw when Klaus Barbie was in his height of power and working with President or the military dictator out there.
[02:37:59.078 --> 02:38:06.959]  So, yes, I'm quite familiar with this drill and that's what's unfortunate about this time ever since 9-11, which is obviously
[02:38:10.543 --> 02:38:18.106]  You know, false flag terrorist event, and incidentally, Operation Condor extensively used false flag terrorist events.
[02:38:18.146 --> 02:38:28.170]  Yeah, well the Nazis used it to start war with Poland, and the Glywods event, and of course the Reichstag, now admitted to being Hitlerian, so this is their specialty.
[02:38:29.351 --> 02:38:30.491]  That's exactly right.
[02:38:31.031 --> 02:38:34.913]  They have used that and the strategy of tension.
[02:38:36.594 --> 02:38:39.635]  I was actually thinking that maybe later on in the interview we could
[02:38:40.154 --> 02:38:46.517]  Read some of those documents that were emanating probably from the NATO Supreme Command to the Gladio Warriors.
[02:38:46.537 --> 02:38:49.579]  Yeah, we're going to do that because we've got to let Mark Dice go.
[02:38:49.599 --> 02:38:52.480]  That relates to what's happening exactly right now.
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:53.841]  Sure, we've got to let Mark Dice go.
[02:38:54.521 --> 02:38:55.402]  Mark, we're praying for you.
[02:38:55.442 --> 02:38:56.422]  I'll stay in contact.
[02:38:56.462 --> 02:39:01.845]  I'm going to have Trey, the producer, call you right now and set you up for 4.30 Central, 2.30 Pacific.
[02:39:02.205 --> 02:39:03.646]  Are you going to be able to do that Sunday?
[02:39:04.166 --> 02:39:08.048]  I'll do that and I want to let everybody know that in a couple days or maybe a week I'm going to release
[02:39:08.824 --> 02:39:14.566]  Several chapters of the Resistance Manifesto revised edition in a PDF format for free.
[02:39:15.206 --> 02:39:20.128]  The revised edition is going to be out hopefully in several weeks, if not the middle of the summer.
[02:39:20.748 --> 02:39:22.408]  Just get that information out to everybody.
[02:39:22.929 --> 02:39:23.309]  I've got to go.
[02:39:23.329 --> 02:39:24.229]  I've got a lot of work to do.
[02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:25.689]  I'll keep in contact with you guys.
[02:39:25.909 --> 02:39:26.350]  Alright, Mark.
[02:39:26.410 --> 02:39:30.851]  One more time, fire the numbers out to the FCC and to that criminal, Michael Reagan.
[02:39:31.931 --> 02:39:33.252]  The FCC is 1-888-CALL-FCC.
[02:39:38.694 --> 02:39:41.757]  1-888-CALL-C-A-L-L-F-C-C.
[02:39:41.917 --> 02:39:43.739]  That's for the Federal Communications Commission.
[02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:48.965]  His syndicator is Radio America at RadioAmerica.org.
[02:39:49.365 --> 02:39:49.946]  Their number is 703-302-1000-703.
[02:40:00.193 --> 02:40:06.340]  And his show starts in two and a half hours, 5 p.m.
[02:40:06.380 --> 02:40:07.301]  central, I believe.
[02:40:07.681 --> 02:40:13.288]  Folks, call in, get past the screeners, get on the air and tell him how dare him engage in these crimes.
[02:40:13.928 --> 02:40:14.769]  He said, deal with it.
[02:40:14.809 --> 02:40:15.871]  We are going to deal with it.
[02:40:16.371 --> 02:40:19.113]  And we got a lot of good people in the government who are exposing all this.
[02:40:19.153 --> 02:40:19.954]  They're very upset.
[02:40:19.994 --> 02:40:27.420]  This is a key criminal subset cadre, compartmentalized black operation, and they will be brought to justice.
[02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:30.022]  Mark Dice, we will be talking to you on Sunday.
[02:40:30.062 --> 02:40:30.422]  Take care.
[02:40:31.063 --> 02:40:33.445]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, there goes Mark Dice.
[02:40:33.465 --> 02:40:34.065]  We're going to come in.
[02:40:34.105 --> 02:40:38.789]  Let's move fast with the basics on this David Edwards right now.
[02:40:38.809 --> 02:40:39.870]  We're going live in 10 seconds.
[02:40:49.151 --> 02:40:51.574]  We'll ride again.
[02:41:04.161 --> 02:41:06.022]  We'll ride again no matter what you do to us.
[02:41:07.643 --> 02:41:11.806]  The spirit of humanity, the spirit of liberty.
[02:41:12.207 --> 02:41:16.850]  You're gonna lose.
[02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:20.252]  You've done so many horrible things to so many people.
[02:41:20.352 --> 02:41:22.954]  All those graves they've dug up all over Latin America and Asia.
[02:41:22.974 --> 02:41:25.476]  Put your gun down, whole families and little babies.
[02:41:26.717 --> 02:41:30.259]  You're going to pay.
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:37.164]  They've trained lots of dentists, Mexican paramilitary teams committing murders from Indiana to Texas.
[02:41:37.184 --> 02:41:41.627]  All right, going to our guest, David Edwards, academic.
[02:41:41.647 --> 02:41:42.808]  Give out any websites you want.
[02:41:42.828 --> 02:41:43.588]  You've got the floor.
[02:41:43.929 --> 02:41:45.170]  David, break down what we're facing.
[02:41:47.091 --> 02:41:48.212]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:41:48.332 --> 02:41:52.675]  I just wanted to, I've always told myself that if I had the opportunity to
[02:41:53.609 --> 02:41:58.832]  Speak with you, I just wanted to tip my hat to you and your work surrounding the Bohemian Grove.
[02:42:01.313 --> 02:42:15.421]  I had a very interesting experience some 30 years ago as I started to realize that my own father was a member of the Bohemian Club, as he had related to me and what exactly that meant.
[02:42:16.581 --> 02:42:19.083]  And I went for years really not understanding
[02:42:21.347 --> 02:42:29.794]  What all that meant until I was able to go to your website sometime late in 2000 and actually found video streaming.
[02:42:31.135 --> 02:42:32.716]  So, that really changed my life.
[02:42:32.756 --> 02:42:33.857]  I just wanted to thank you for that.
[02:42:33.877 --> 02:42:38.982]  Are you there?
[02:42:40.383 --> 02:42:40.703]  Jones?
[02:42:42.164 --> 02:42:42.424]  Hello?
[02:42:43.906 --> 02:42:45.027]  Just go ahead and keep talking.
[02:42:46.228 --> 02:42:46.748]  Oh, okay.
[02:42:47.989 --> 02:42:48.890]  Anyway, as it is,
[02:42:49.620 --> 02:43:01.164]  Um, I thought that it would be really salient, just trying to get a grasp of the moment and thinking about, you know, what's happened in the last few years and what's taking place right now.
[02:43:01.685 --> 02:43:18.071]  I just was going to read very quickly, um, one of the documents that was, uh, discovered among some of the former Italian fascist, uh, gladio warriors and undoubtedly having emanated from the NATO Supreme Command.
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:46.820]  Describing the strategy of tension and just very clearly Talking about what our moment is right now, so I'm going to just read that really quickly Our belief is that and again, I'm quoting our belief is that the first phase of political activity ought to be to create the conditions favoring the installation of Chaos and all of the regime's structures, and this is talking about any regime that
[02:43:47.398 --> 02:43:58.621]  That, uh, the Gladio system, or the Condor system for that matter, which was a subset of the Gladio operations, um, any regime that the system would target.
[02:44:00.141 --> 02:44:06.823]  This should necessarily begin with the undermining of the state economy, so as to arrive at confusion throughout the whole legal apparatus.
[02:44:07.763 --> 02:44:16.325]  This leads on to a situation of strong political tension, fear in the world of industry, and hostility toward the government and the political parties.
[02:44:16.812 --> 02:44:25.294]  In our view, the first move we should make is to destroy the structure of the democratic state, under the cover of communist and pro-Chinese activities.
[02:44:25.975 --> 02:44:37.838]  Moreover, we have people who have infiltrated these groups, and obviously we will have to tailor our actions to the ethos of the milieu, depending on what the culture of that particular country or regime might be.
[02:44:38.518 --> 02:44:44.220]  Propaganda and action of a sort which will seem to have emanated from our communist adversaries
[02:44:44.853 --> 02:44:49.055]  And pressure brought to bear on people in whom power is invested at every level.
[02:44:49.436 --> 02:45:01.922]  That will create a feeling of hostility toward those who threaten the peace of each and every nation and at the same time we must raise up a defender of the citizenry against the disintegration brought about by terrorism and subversion.
[02:45:02.463 --> 02:45:14.049]  And what we see here in this little microscopic event with Mark is that obviously that strategy of tension is being turned on him and he's being depicted
[02:45:14.714 --> 02:45:19.657]  As being subversive, as being quote-unquote a terrorist, which is what they do.
[02:45:20.177 --> 02:45:34.106]  And then riding in on the white horse in the microcosm is this Reagan fellow who's basically saying, we're going to go ahead and defend our country, defend our troops against this subversion.
[02:45:38.516 --> 02:45:40.156]  Listen, I'm giving you the floor in here, man.
[02:45:40.176 --> 02:45:41.557]  I'm sitting back listening, so go ahead.
[02:45:42.117 --> 02:45:42.577]  Oh, okay.
[02:45:42.597 --> 02:45:43.857]  We're about to go to break in a moment, though.
[02:45:45.037 --> 02:45:49.338]  I'm just so used to you being such a ready participant in the conversation.
[02:45:49.538 --> 02:45:53.059]  I know, but I cut your time short today, so I'm letting you go.
[02:45:53.539 --> 02:45:56.260]  I really do know what Mark's going through.
[02:45:57.180 --> 02:46:07.502]  Of course, my communication was in a far more restricted sort of quiet arena in that I was teaching 9-11 truth.
[02:46:08.929 --> 02:46:22.601]  Um, in the University of Maryland system, and I was also communicating, um, information to those who I thought that information might be sensitive, and... Alright, listen, listen, the full audience is back in three minutes, but this is so important, I want to keep talking to you during the break.
[02:46:22.981 --> 02:46:33.690]  For people listening on the InfoWars.com screens, and of course those listening, uh, watching PrisonPlanet.tv, because these death threats are too important, we need every minute of time we have, because we've got the Ron Paul campaign on in 15 minutes.
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:36.520]  Alright, continue sir.
[02:46:36.741 --> 02:46:38.702]  Continue, because this will all be up on YouTube and other places.
[02:46:38.942 --> 02:46:41.623]  They get it off PrisonPlanet.tv, the members do, the great folks there.
[02:46:42.423 --> 02:46:42.864]  Continue.
[02:46:44.484 --> 02:47:04.274]  Alright, so, as I was saying earlier, when I did let the Bolivian officials know through some back channels what it was that this private security firm was trying to get me to do, then I immediately, there in Annapolis, Maryland,
[02:47:04.667 --> 02:47:14.230]  I began to experience intimidation and then there were in fact attempts on my life which induced me to get out of the area.
[02:47:14.410 --> 02:47:15.210]  Tell us about those.
[02:47:15.270 --> 02:47:16.631]  Specifically, what did they do?
[02:47:17.191 --> 02:47:19.032]  Hold on, let me stop you.
[02:47:19.912 --> 02:47:23.453]  Is that in the psyops... David, stop, stop.
[02:47:23.473 --> 02:47:24.173]  You want me to interrupt you?
[02:47:24.193 --> 02:47:24.433]  I will.
[02:47:24.694 --> 02:47:27.474]  I mean, specifically, tell us about the attempts on your life.
[02:47:29.395 --> 02:47:31.716]  Well, I'll just talk about one experience.
[02:47:33.045 --> 02:47:57.925]  And I think that the attempt was cast in this sort of methodology because I had worked for the Smithsonian, I had been vetted by, you know, I was a federal employee, I had to go through a background check, obviously I was not a subversive in their sort of definition of the term, or a terrorist, of course, and so I think that
[02:47:58.632 --> 02:48:06.613]  That basically made it a little bit more difficult to just pick me up on the street and disappear me, although I know that's happening quite a bit now.
[02:48:07.954 --> 02:48:27.937]  But what did happen to me was that after some of the intimidation tactics had taken place, and I continued to speak out and to communicate to the people I was talking to about 9-11 Truth, about the strategy of tension, and about these private security firms, and
[02:48:28.559 --> 02:48:29.980]  And fascism in America.
[02:48:31.321 --> 02:48:36.744]  One day in Annapolis, Maryland, I was going through a very large intersection.
[02:48:37.224 --> 02:48:42.087]  There was a green light in front of me, and all the cars were going about 40-50 miles.
[02:48:43.528 --> 02:48:49.571]  And suddenly, two cars in front of me, just all of a sudden, slammed on their brakes.
[02:48:49.631 --> 02:48:50.172]  Two cars.
[02:48:50.572 --> 02:48:57.456]  And I looked in the rearview mirror really quickly, and there was a huge semi-truck bearing down behind me.
[02:48:58.234 --> 02:49:20.599]  I had, you know, way less than a second to make a decision, and I just went, you know, 50, 60 miles, made a, had a, make a very hairpin left-hand turn and get out of their way, and I looked in my rearview mirror, and when they saw that I had gotten out of their way, they just continued on as if there was still a green light, but they had come to a complete stop.
[02:49:21.445 --> 02:49:24.746]  Well, these guys in Virginia that I saw last week, they didn't even hide it.
[02:49:24.826 --> 02:49:29.767]  It's about 6'2", 6'3", 240 pounds, and we'd see them go into Bilderberg.
[02:49:29.787 --> 02:49:37.468]  They were admitted, military, secret police, special forces, all about 35 years old, 40 years old, and they didn't even try to hide who they were.
[02:49:37.648 --> 02:49:39.428]  They didn't want us getting video of their faces, though.
[02:49:41.129 --> 02:49:43.949]  Did they look like that, the guys driving the cars?
[02:49:44.029 --> 02:49:46.010]  We're these private security firms.
[02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:46.670]  Yeah, the same look.
[02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:47.870]  Okay, listen, we're going live.
[02:49:47.890 --> 02:49:48.110]  Here we go.
[02:49:53.459 --> 02:49:55.581]  I gotta say, it's exciting, it's exhilarating.
[02:49:55.601 --> 02:49:56.842]  My life means something.
[02:49:57.583 --> 02:50:13.417]  I'm going toe-to-toe with the private security firms and the people inside the criminal government that work for the Fortune 100 banks that are gutting this country, setting it up to take the pension funds, the whole economy down, as the IMF and World Bank documents, 2002, March, that will release state, they will do.
[02:50:14.839 --> 02:50:16.160]  We're here defending the Republic.
[02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:18.022]  We were just talking to this academic.
[02:50:19.312 --> 02:50:20.492]  They're working for the Smithsonian.
[02:50:21.373 --> 02:50:23.393]  They tried to recruit him into covert operations.
[02:50:23.914 --> 02:50:28.695]  He spoke out against it, exposed it, tried to kill him.
[02:50:28.735 --> 02:50:33.817]  They tried to run him down with a semi to see the black op high and tight guys right there looking at you like they're hunting.
[02:50:34.717 --> 02:50:37.478]  It's just like, they're devils when you look in their eyes.
[02:50:38.779 --> 02:50:44.480]  What they don't understand is, they could probably break me, put me in a bag, keep a hood over my head, torture me for months.
[02:50:44.661 --> 02:50:45.241]  I'll be a mess.
[02:50:46.408 --> 02:50:47.169]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:50:47.209 --> 02:50:49.031]  My missiles in the Info War are fired.
[02:50:49.071 --> 02:50:50.393]  My payload is dropped.
[02:50:52.936 --> 02:50:53.296]  I'm there.
[02:50:53.436 --> 02:50:53.877]  I've done it.
[02:50:54.217 --> 02:50:59.203]  I have gotten hundreds of millions of people, conservatively, to see the films I've produced online.
[02:50:59.803 --> 02:51:01.165]  I have woken up tens of millions.
[02:51:01.205 --> 02:51:02.747]  You, my listeners, have done the same thing.
[02:51:04.088 --> 02:51:05.630]  And I know I've done the right thing.
[02:51:06.701 --> 02:51:10.943]  And I know that I'm declaring the victory right now, you can't take away what we've done.
[02:51:11.284 --> 02:51:22.330]  Going back to you sir, we've got about 12 minutes before Ron Paul's and half the time his campaign head is so busy he'll end up, he wanted on but he'll end up not calling in so maybe at the end of the hour but we'll see what happens.
[02:51:22.730 --> 02:51:25.292]  Are we calling Ron Paul's guy Jesse Benton or is he calling us John?
[02:51:25.452 --> 02:51:25.912]  I'm calling him.
[02:51:26.272 --> 02:51:27.993]  Okay, we'll call him in about 45 after.
[02:51:29.134 --> 02:51:31.036]  You've got the floor for the last time that we've got.
[02:51:31.056 --> 02:51:33.297]  I'll have you back up in the next few weeks for two hours.
[02:51:33.337 --> 02:51:34.218]  This is too important.
[02:51:34.819 --> 02:51:35.619]  But continue.
[02:51:35.639 --> 02:51:40.483]  Earlier you were reading their own government documents declassified about how they control the communists, the fascists.
[02:51:40.523 --> 02:51:41.243]  It's all staged.
[02:51:41.544 --> 02:51:41.944]  Continue.
[02:51:44.146 --> 02:51:44.866]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:51:45.106 --> 02:51:51.191]  Well, one of the things that, you know, referencing back to Operation Condor, which
[02:51:52.017 --> 02:51:57.361]  Many people don't realize Operation Condor was a subset of Operation Gladio.
[02:51:58.042 --> 02:52:18.478]  And often times you had Gladio warriors, and I'm talking about ex-Nazi commando, the SS Gestapo, as well as Italian black shirt fascists, and the other sort of paramilitaries that were developed by NATO, by the CIA, after World War II, would come from Europe.
[02:52:19.116 --> 02:52:28.064]  Go into Latin America and participate, lead, train, organize, death squads, torture cells,
[02:52:30.035 --> 02:52:35.178]  And so it, Operation Condor was definitely a subset of Operation Gladius.
[02:52:35.198 --> 02:52:44.844]  And now they're using the cadres they trained, tens of thousands, and it's now mainstream news, we reported it years before it came out, in Iraq, and now they're trying to set up... I'm so glad you're bringing that up, Alex.
[02:52:44.905 --> 02:52:58.173]  That's exactly, I just wanted to sort of trace that genealogy really quickly, that one of the things that people don't generally understand is that Operation Condor, which was basically a South American
[02:52:58.953 --> 02:53:18.077]  Phenomenon was then brought up into Central America in the 1980s and Oliver North and all of the Iran Contra villains were involved in an Operation Condor operation in Central America in the Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala.
[02:53:18.298 --> 02:53:28.620]  Guatemala and the massacre of, you know, about 150,000 Guatemalan Maya was a Condor operation and Oliver North
[02:53:29.216 --> 02:53:53.482]  And the different Condor commandos who were working in Central America, then later on, and as well as the South American Condorites, did organize themselves into private security firms that are being contracted, as you were saying, into Iraq, as well as in operations throughout North and South America.
[02:53:53.522 --> 02:53:58.663]  So, you're basically, you have here a cadre of tens of thousands of
[02:53:59.261 --> 02:54:09.527]  private security employees who have been trained either directly or indirectly literally by Nazis.
[02:54:09.647 --> 02:54:15.010]  And now it's come out in mainstream news that the army training schools teach them how to torture people.
[02:54:15.370 --> 02:54:17.871]  Now it's not even hidden what went on at the School of Americas.
[02:54:19.272 --> 02:54:20.153]  That's exactly right.
[02:54:20.193 --> 02:54:28.017]  And that entire complex of the School of Americas and Operation Condor had as its
[02:54:28.624 --> 02:54:32.240]  Genesis, the bringing over of the Nazis.
[02:54:32.930 --> 02:54:36.232]  into South America back in the late forties and the fifties.
[02:54:36.352 --> 02:54:42.917]  And really, this is private corporate interests with drug dealing, murdering, torture teams that just said, why not take the US over too?
[02:54:43.437 --> 02:54:49.221]  And their arrogant, haughty North and his buddies like Reagan, they just know it.
[02:54:49.241 --> 02:54:50.542]  I mean, they all brag about it.
[02:54:50.882 --> 02:54:54.324]  They get to act like they're patriotic while they suck the country dry and they prance around.
[02:54:54.605 --> 02:54:55.906]  And don't think the left's going to save you.
[02:54:55.926 --> 02:54:57.086]  They're just as involved now.
[02:54:57.367 --> 02:54:59.148]  This thing transcends parties, doesn't it now?
[02:55:00.029 --> 02:55:01.410]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:55:03.491 --> 02:55:27.906]  One of the things that I definitely wanted to say today was that, unfortunately, one of the big psyops is that we currently live in a fascist state, and the psyop is that all of the facades of American, Republican democracy continue to exist, when in fact they do not.
[02:55:28.602 --> 02:55:42.454]  And that's the appeal that I was hearing today about, you know, appealing to the judicial system and everything, which undoubtedly at the lower levels, the last bastion of constitutional democracy here in this country.
[02:55:42.834 --> 02:55:52.623]  And yet, still, we really don't have anything but a hollow shell of the constitutional government that we have been raised to believe in.
[02:55:53.443 --> 02:55:54.765]  So the problem here is that
[02:55:57.412 --> 02:56:14.083]  Now when they start to get more overt like this, which is exactly what they did in South America during the Condor years, I think basically what they're basically saying is, we're going to go ahead, we're going to do what we want to do, and you just watch, we can do this with impunity.
[02:56:17.064 --> 02:56:21.967]  Yeah, well, there are a lot of people in this country who aren't poor, starving, unarmed,
[02:56:23.996 --> 02:56:27.798]  Mesoamerican populations and it's going to get bad, my God.
[02:56:28.999 --> 02:56:31.380]  Now the good news is this has been going on so long.
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:32.681]  That's part one, I want you to answer that.
[02:56:32.721 --> 02:56:35.763]  But then part two, look at the intelligence community speaking out.
[02:56:35.823 --> 02:56:37.044]  Look at all the generals coming out.
[02:56:37.364 --> 02:56:38.744]  Look at people saying no to torture.
[02:56:39.265 --> 02:56:41.326]  I mean, I want people to know we've got a fighting chance here.
[02:56:41.346 --> 02:56:43.447]  They may be able to kill a few of us and try to scare everybody.
[02:56:43.747 --> 02:56:45.708]  You've got to get more vocal if that happens, folks.
[02:56:45.749 --> 02:56:47.289]  Don't let us die in vain if that is to happen.
[02:56:47.329 --> 02:56:47.930]  And God forbid it.
[02:56:47.970 --> 02:56:50.011]  I love my life and want it to continue on.
[02:56:50.511 --> 02:56:51.512]  But go ahead and comment on that.
[02:56:52.679 --> 02:56:57.121]  Well, I think I'm going to come at this from a very different angle.
[02:56:58.081 --> 02:57:11.066]  One of the other things that I did want to communicate today was that I am a cultural anthropologist, and I'm currently working with the more traditional and the more religious Hopi Indians.
[02:57:11.726 --> 02:57:21.670]  Just in the course of events, I did share some of the information that I've been able to discover in the last seven or eight years.
[02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:24.670]  Just talking to them about 9-11 and that type of thing.
[02:57:24.710 --> 02:57:35.813]  And surprisingly, the Hopi Indians actually have a number of prophecies that directly address the current situation that we're in right now.
[02:57:35.933 --> 02:57:48.676]  And while I can't be exactly specific, one of the things that they do say is that there will be something that will make the 1860s in this country just look like nothing.
[02:57:48.896 --> 02:57:51.277]  That there is going to be a huge conflict.
[02:57:51.735 --> 02:57:54.317]  Within this country and a very large loss of life.
[02:57:56.398 --> 02:58:00.880]  Well, just geopolitically, I can look at that from a sociological perspective.
[02:58:01.661 --> 02:58:08.445]  You know, these young guys on power trips that have tortured, they've wedded themselves to evil, they've committed to what they're doing because they've had to rationalize it.
[02:58:08.745 --> 02:58:09.846]  Some are just psychopaths.
[02:58:11.987 --> 02:58:12.948]  I want you to address the point.
[02:58:12.968 --> 02:58:14.268]  They are losing the moral ground.
[02:58:14.288 --> 02:58:16.129]  A lot of their people do not like what's happening now.
[02:58:16.490 --> 02:58:18.391]  It's one thing to go down there and kill, quote, foreigners.
[02:58:18.451 --> 02:58:20.112]  It's another thing to come here and do, is what I'm saying.
[02:58:21.072 --> 02:58:33.378]  Well, that's exactly it, and that very much mirrors when you talk about the retired intelligence community, the retired military, all these generals leaving.
[02:58:33.798 --> 02:58:50.026]  This is exactly what happened in all of the South American countries where Condor existed, which is basically all of them, but Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, you name it.
[02:58:50.899 --> 02:58:52.140]  And in Chile, obviously.
[02:58:52.420 --> 02:59:02.689]  But in all of those countries, you had this small fascist elite who then went after what they called the Constitutionalists.
[02:59:03.209 --> 02:59:19.923]  And that included generals and politicians, and much of what Condor was about was identifying the opposition in the regular hierarchy of the military and the political world, and murdering those people
[02:59:20.345 --> 02:59:28.554]  And eliminating them so that they could silence all official or legitimate voices of opposition to this program.
[02:59:28.574 --> 02:59:37.724]  So, they start out as a very small, tight, elite cadre, and then they go about eliminating all of the significant legitimate voices.
[02:59:39.505 --> 02:59:41.086]  But again, I've analyzed the history.
[02:59:41.106 --> 02:59:45.867]  I mean, you're an expert in this, but you recognize I've read quite a bit about it myself and had a lot of other experts on.
[02:59:46.387 --> 02:59:54.250]  I see a different sociological makeup here, and they even admit in a lot of their own documents that it's not going to be as easy here as it was in Latin America.
[02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:58.711]  And a lot of them... I mean, people are going to strike back, is my point.
[02:59:59.091 --> 03:00:07.474]  This is not just... Well, yes, and I've had conversations with... I think one of the things that they've actually, you know, now try to avoid
[03:00:08.024 --> 03:00:22.356]  But I think the Vietnam War actually comes into play here because there you had a very large group of citizen vets who have now come back and who understand how to handle themselves, etc.
[03:00:22.936 --> 03:00:35.226]  And I have actually had conversations with vets who say to me, you know, if what you say is true about 9-11 and all of this, what they say is that there are 500,000
[03:00:37.096 --> 03:00:42.279]  People who would, in fact, fight against something like that, if what you're saying is true.
[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:52.061]  Just hope to God they stop.
[03:00:52.201 --> 03:00:56.464]  I mean, I hope to God they slow down, but the signs are... Folks, this is the endgame.
[03:00:56.504 --> 03:00:57.545]  We told you this was real.
[03:00:57.565 --> 03:00:58.726]  We told you they were building camps.
[03:00:58.966 --> 03:01:00.687]  And you're the main target, American people.
[03:01:01.788 --> 03:01:03.469]  It's not just us at the forefront fighting them.
[03:01:04.110 --> 03:01:06.031]  And I'm at the point of no return a long time ago.
[03:01:06.071 --> 03:01:07.972]  I'm committed to this, and I'm at peace with that.
[03:01:09.633 --> 03:01:14.697]  It's just so sad that more good people didn't stand up earlier, before this probably unfolds.
[03:01:17.637 --> 03:01:19.458]  It's just so sad.
[03:01:19.478 --> 03:01:20.479]  God, it's sad.
[03:01:20.499 --> 03:01:37.327]  Well, as you know, I'm working with Peter Dale Scott on this book, and he is one of the foremost voices in terms of trying to bring to light what it is that they've been doing ever since the 1980s in the development of continuity of government in terms of the internment camps.
[03:01:37.947 --> 03:01:44.891]  And one of the things that, again, one of the things that people don't realize is that the internment camps, concentration camps, torture camps,
[03:01:45.427 --> 03:01:48.930]  We're a very huge part of the apparatus of Operation Condor.
[03:01:49.050 --> 03:01:54.333]  God, I think about all the admitted crimes, how they would enjoyably murder children and torture them to death.
[03:01:54.674 --> 03:01:56.395]  I just can't believe that's who we are.
[03:01:57.236 --> 03:02:01.218]  And I can't believe that they somehow sold a bunch of mainline conservatives that that's manly.
[03:02:02.199 --> 03:02:03.060]  God help them all.
[03:02:03.240 --> 03:02:03.980]  God help them all.
[03:02:04.601 --> 03:02:05.281]  God help them.
[03:02:06.262 --> 03:02:14.148]  Well, you know, Alex, one other thing that I really did want to share today before we ran out of time was that, you know, when we start talking about our political leadership,
[03:02:14.969 --> 03:02:19.411]  You know, one has to realize that, um, just give you one example.
[03:02:19.431 --> 03:02:22.732]  Well, let me say this, there's a reason Congress doesn't impeach.
[03:02:22.972 --> 03:02:24.552]  There's a reason they're all scared, too.
[03:02:24.612 --> 03:02:25.073]  They know!
[03:02:26.073 --> 03:02:42.499]  Well, as early as 1979, there was a secret, classified Senate report that talked about the fact that the CIA was running Operation Condor with the full participation
[03:02:43.374 --> 03:02:43.935]  I don't
[03:02:56.525 --> 03:03:00.528]  Jack Anderson got his hands on it and started reporting on it in August of 1979.
[03:03:00.748 --> 03:03:04.471]  Well, listen, we've got to let you go because we've got the Ron Paul campaign here, but I'll say this.
[03:03:04.811 --> 03:03:17.960]  My grandfather worked in the oil fields and was a leasehound, and when he was out in Midland, Texas, he said that he'd go into the military slash oil field worker bar restaurants and he'd see a bunch of Germans there in U.S.
[03:03:18.001 --> 03:03:18.821]  military uniforms.
[03:03:18.861 --> 03:03:19.842]  This wasn't with NASA.
[03:03:20.182 --> 03:03:21.383]  So it's just everywhere.
[03:03:21.763 --> 03:03:25.126]  Give out some websites real fast, and then we're going to have you back up in the next few weeks.
[03:03:26.392 --> 03:03:27.112]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:03:27.212 --> 03:03:28.033]  It's been a real honor.

[03:03:53.772 --> 03:03:54.673]  Thanks a lot.
[03:03:55.013 --> 03:03:55.333]  You bet.
[03:03:55.373 --> 03:03:55.834]  Thank you.
[03:03:55.914 --> 03:04:01.178]  Let's go to Jesse Benton for the next three minutes and then the final segment of the show coming up with Ron Paul's announcement.
[03:04:02.119 --> 03:04:05.721]  He never really even said he was dropping out of the campaign last night, but the website said that.
[03:04:06.422 --> 03:04:08.884]  So to be specific, what is going on, Jesse Benton?
[03:04:09.850 --> 03:04:11.351]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[03:04:12.231 --> 03:04:15.393]  You know, what's going on is we're launching phase two of this revolution.
[03:04:15.413 --> 03:04:22.197]  You know, the presidential campaign was phase one in the revolution to restore our republic and take back our constitution.
[03:04:22.217 --> 03:04:31.162]  And if you just look at the incredible expansion of liberty-minded people and the way the message spread during the past 17 months of the PCC, it's been incredible.
[03:04:31.482 --> 03:04:33.884]  And it's all because of the grassroots supporters out there.
[03:04:34.384 --> 03:04:42.669]  And now what Dr. Paul has legally ended the PCC, but that's just to get the FEC off our backs so we can really do the work that we need to do.
[03:04:43.029 --> 03:04:46.331]  And that is rolling up our sleeves, you know, working with the grassroots.
[03:04:46.391 --> 03:04:56.017]  Dr. Paul's going to be a leader and, you know, but at the same time he's going to encourage the grassroots to keep going with all the spontaneous creativity that they've shown throughout this campaign.
[03:04:56.597 --> 03:04:59.598]  And he's going to be there to help encourage and lead.
[03:04:59.638 --> 03:05:11.922]  We're going to organize at the grassroots level and we're going to elect other candidates, constitutionalist candidates, limited government candidates, to office at the state and federal level all across this country.
[03:05:13.182 --> 03:05:19.524]  Jesse Benton, tell us about the parallel convention or rally that's going to be happening in Minnesota.
[03:05:20.575 --> 03:05:23.656]  It's going to be at the Williams Arena at the University of Minnesota.
[03:05:23.736 --> 03:05:26.037]  It's going to be on Tuesday, September 2nd.
[03:05:26.117 --> 03:05:27.678]  It's going to be an all-day event.
[03:05:27.738 --> 03:05:29.959]  We're inviting some great guest speakers.
[03:05:29.979 --> 03:05:31.139]  We're going to have entertainment.
[03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:34.741]  We're going to have just a really amazing day.
[03:05:35.041 --> 03:05:36.822]  It's going to be a celebration of liberty.
[03:05:37.302 --> 03:05:39.983]  And a celebration of traditional Republican values.
[03:05:40.263 --> 03:05:41.223]  Real limited government.
[03:05:41.243 --> 03:05:46.545]  And we're going to send a powerful message to the Republican Party that their limited government works.
[03:05:46.585 --> 03:05:53.288]  There are people out there that really want their freedom, they want their liberties, and they want the Republican Party to return to what they used to stand for.
[03:05:53.388 --> 03:05:55.508]  And that, of course, is being the party of limited government.
[03:05:55.528 --> 03:05:59.910]  What about with all the delegates, Ron Paul, God, what are we planning inside the main convention?
[03:06:00.842 --> 03:06:04.605]  Ron, Dr. Paul is still strongly encouraging all of his delegates to go.
[03:06:05.185 --> 03:06:14.691]  We believe we have about 50 people that were bound to Dr. Paul, and then we think we have dozens and dozens more that were perhaps bound to other candidates, but were supportive of Dr. Paul.
[03:06:14.972 --> 03:06:28.901]  We're saying still go, take part, be a voice for limited government, be respectful, yet be very energetic, and let's show these Republicans that we want limited government, influence the platform, and let's get this party fixed.
[03:06:30.487 --> 03:06:37.087]  Jesse Benton, how much money was left over that was raised and what is that going to be used on?
[03:06:38.001 --> 03:06:51.269]  About four million bucks is left over, and we're moving very carefully because the FEC is very fickle, but that money is going to be able to be transferred into the new organization, Campaign for Liberty.
[03:06:51.489 --> 03:06:55.032]  Check us out at thecampaignforliberty.com and sign up to join us today.
[03:06:55.412 --> 03:07:01.896]  So that money is going to be there for grassroots organizing, for getting the message out, and for electing candidates.
[03:07:02.276 --> 03:07:16.981]  The congressman told me about a month ago on air that he was going to launch a battle plan to fight the NAU, to fight the open borders, to fight to end the war, so that the huge organization of grassroots still has actions to take to keep this army together.
[03:07:17.041 --> 03:07:17.321]  Jesse?
[03:07:18.689 --> 03:07:19.550]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:07:20.831 --> 03:07:21.691]  That's what it's all about.
[03:07:21.731 --> 03:07:23.072]  We need to increase our numbers.
[03:07:24.974 --> 03:07:29.217]  That's why we had to transition into Phase 2 of this revolution.
[03:07:29.517 --> 03:07:34.581]  Because when you're operating under FEC guidelines, there's just very little that you can do.
[03:07:34.641 --> 03:07:36.202]  We need to grow this effort.
[03:07:36.222 --> 03:07:38.663]  Well, $4 million is a great seed for that.
[03:07:38.964 --> 03:07:39.824]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[03:07:39.864 --> 03:07:42.686]  Final segment with Jesse Benton, Communications Director, Ron Paul 2008.
[03:07:45.626 --> 03:07:49.107]  Fuel prices are at an all-time high with no relief in sight.
[03:07:49.307 --> 03:07:51.987]  Do you feel powerless against the large oil companies?
[03:07:52.267 --> 03:07:53.328]  Now you can fight back.
[03:07:53.628 --> 03:07:58.269]  Doer Alt Fuel Conditioner from Fuel Saver Incorporated is the solution you need.
[03:08:00.849 --> 03:08:01.389]  We're off air.
[03:08:01.509 --> 03:08:01.729]  No.
[03:08:02.029 --> 03:08:02.289]  Cut it.
[03:08:02.789 --> 03:08:06.670]  When you're operating under FEC guidelines, there's just very little that you can do.
[03:08:06.690 --> 03:08:08.311]  We need to grow this effort.
[03:08:08.351 --> 03:08:10.791]  Well, four million is a great seed for that.
[03:08:10.811 --> 03:08:11.951]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[03:08:11.991 --> 03:08:13.252]  Final segment with Jesse Benton.
[03:08:13.672 --> 03:08:14.832]  Communications Director, Ron Paul 2008.
[03:08:17.708 --> 03:08:21.189]  Fuel prices are at an all-time high with no relief in sight.
[03:08:21.389 --> 03:08:24.070]  Do you feel powerless against the large oil companies?
[03:08:24.351 --> 03:08:25.411]  Now you can fight back.
[03:08:25.711 --> 03:08:32.954]  Doer Alt Fuel Conditioner from Fuel Saver Incorporated is the solution you need for power, performance, and especially savings.
[03:08:33.194 --> 03:08:34.115]  Fuel Saver Inc.'

[03:10:56.010 --> 03:10:58.851]  Tim Russert, 58, was vacationing with his family in Italy.
[03:10:58.871 --> 03:11:02.952]  He returned last night, collapsed while recording a track at Bureau in D.C.
[03:11:02.972 --> 03:11:06.873]  Industry shock, he's dead.
[03:11:10.794 --> 03:11:12.514]  Yeah, life isn't a joke, folks.
[03:11:12.614 --> 03:11:14.255]  It goes by so quick.
[03:11:14.835 --> 03:11:22.057]  And all you that serve evil, you're going to have your judgment before God one day.
[03:11:22.077 --> 03:11:23.257]  A very wicked man is dead.
[03:11:24.626 --> 03:11:25.847]  We're sad for his family, though.
[03:11:26.748 --> 03:11:29.189]  He served the new world order with pride.
[03:11:30.310 --> 03:11:31.410]  Now he's gone to his father.
[03:11:33.972 --> 03:11:38.875]  Jesse Benton, in closing with the Ron Paul 2008 campaign, I salute you for your fine work.
[03:11:39.436 --> 03:11:41.357]  The Trilateral Commission, we got their minutes out.
[03:11:41.717 --> 03:11:49.482]  Number one thing was the Ron Paul revolution, not winning the presidency, but the fact that young people are learning about liberty instead of statism and centralization.
[03:11:49.862 --> 03:11:51.323]  In two final minutes, you've got the floor.
[03:11:51.363 --> 03:11:52.404]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[03:11:53.821 --> 03:12:01.008]  No, well, of course, there's plenty I'd like to add, Alex, because your listeners, they really go all out to support this cause.
[03:12:01.448 --> 03:12:13.699]  And we just want to encourage everybody to go ahead and visit CampaignForLiberty.com, sign up to join us, check out our blog, and start sending us comments about what you'd like to see us be doing.
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:20.284]  Also, you know, I've pledged to come and make plans to come to the rally on September 2nd.
[03:12:20.324 --> 03:12:21.045]  It's going to be great.
[03:12:21.345 --> 03:12:23.166]  We're going to have a great time.
[03:12:23.186 --> 03:12:24.467]  It's going to be wonderful.
[03:12:24.547 --> 03:12:35.875]  And every single person that gets there, there's going to be one more bullet in our gun to really just fire at the establishment and say that, hey, you know, we want limited government.
[03:12:35.935 --> 03:12:36.755]  We want our liberties.
[03:12:36.815 --> 03:12:41.619]  So I just hope everybody can get there and really just celebrate our American traditions.
[03:12:42.418 --> 03:12:48.022]  Absolutely, and you're getting all hitched up soon into the Ron Paul clan, aren't you?
[03:12:49.223 --> 03:12:50.284]  Yes, sir.
[03:12:50.644 --> 03:12:55.867]  I met my fiancée Valerie Pyatt, who's one of Ron's granddaughters, on the campaign, and we're getting married August 22nd.
[03:12:55.887 --> 03:12:59.450]  As a matter of fact, I'm going to be a mortgage slave, Alex.
[03:12:59.510 --> 03:13:01.892]  I just put an offer in on a house, and it was accepted.
[03:13:01.932 --> 03:13:09.177]  So I'm happy, yet just a little bit nervous about being tied down to the banking system.
[03:13:09.557 --> 03:13:16.459]  Well Jesse, we commend you for a fabulous job of the campaign, and onward and upward, and we'll continue to talk to you as this develops.
[03:13:16.999 --> 03:13:21.721]  Are you now going to join the new Liberty Group, or when is the official campaign going to shut down?
[03:13:21.741 --> 03:13:27.462]  The campaign shut its doors today, and Campaign for Liberty is an organization.
[03:13:27.482 --> 03:13:29.823]  We're up and running, and we need everybody out there to support.
[03:13:30.263 --> 03:13:34.264]  So yes, I will be joining, and in what capacity is yet to be decided.
[03:13:34.284 --> 03:13:42.265]  Well listen, you're a smart guy, but get that manifesto, not just the book, but like four battle points out as soon as you can before any momentum is lost.
[03:13:42.305 --> 03:13:44.306]  Jesse Benton, we salute you, thanks for joining us.
[03:13:44.866 --> 03:13:45.886]  Thanks Alex, appreciate it.
[03:13:46.266 --> 03:13:57.828]  We beat the Lisbon Treaty today, Tim Russert died today at NBC while cutting a track, tyrannies all over the place, Michael Reagan's death-threatening people on air, soliciting murder on air, and it is a threat to everyone.
[03:13:59.650 --> 03:14:01.091]  That's a threat directly from the White House.
[03:14:02.512 --> 03:14:09.217]  I would ask people, if they kill me or Mark Dice or anybody in my family, I'm going to go ahead and say it.
[03:14:09.437 --> 03:14:09.898]  Avenge me.
[03:14:10.938 --> 03:14:11.779]  I'm going to go ahead and say it.
[03:14:11.799 --> 03:14:14.841]  I'm non-violent, but I want whoever does it to be brought to justice.
[03:14:16.122 --> 03:14:18.124]  And I want the enemy brought to justice.
[03:14:18.304 --> 03:14:20.025]  And we'll continue to fight for you as well.
[03:14:20.866 --> 03:14:24.249]  But we're not going to let these unbelievably despicable death squads
[03:14:25.305 --> 03:14:27.567]  We know they use a lot of foreigners too, Israelis and others.
[03:14:27.627 --> 03:14:28.788]  Just keep doing this to us, man.
[03:14:28.808 --> 03:14:29.648]  We just want to be free.
[03:14:29.688 --> 03:14:30.529]  Leave us alone!
[03:14:31.069 --> 03:14:33.351]  Stop destroying our dollar, our name, our country.
[03:14:33.691 --> 03:14:35.072]  Stop carrying out terror attacks.
[03:14:35.092 --> 03:14:35.672]  You killed 3,000 people!
[03:14:37.148 --> 03:14:41.370]  Well, in the military, sometimes we gotta have a pawn sacrifice for the larger betterment of the country.
[03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:42.070]  Bull!
[03:14:42.551 --> 03:14:43.891]  You don't care about this country.
[03:14:44.292 --> 03:14:45.372]  You're destroying this country.

[03:15:10.758 --> 03:15:13.399]  He that is in us is greater than he that is in the world.
