[00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.311]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:10.752]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:12.393]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:16.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.256 --> 00:00:21.338]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:34.353]  Joining us for his monthly visit today, on the 7th of October 2008, Tuesday edition.
[00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:43.259]  Coming up in an hour, we're going to have a 30 minute visit, coming up in a half hour, with Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster about what's happening in the markets.
[00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:55.087]  The markets, by the way, are down right now, 21 points after a huge plunge of around 400 points is what it closed at yesterday, down from last Friday.
[00:00:55.985 --> 00:01:12.134]  So, Bob Chapman, then we have, of course, joining us, Mike Rivera, then we have Richard C. Cook, the historian and economist, analyst, and then Webster Tarpley popping in for an hour as well.
[00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:19.558]  There's a lot of financial news I want to cover today, obviously.
[00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:24.081]  On top of it,
[00:01:25.214 --> 00:01:28.136]  We have a poll by CNN.
[00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:31.318]  60% say depression is likely.
[00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:38.423]  So, I'm sure that was aided by the President and every other major party leader running around saying we're going to have a depression.
[00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:44.507]  Because they want to implode the market now and then loot what's left of the currency.
[00:01:45.307 --> 00:01:48.229]  Brazil, Argentina abandon the U.S.
[00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:49.650]  dollar, completely dump it.
[00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:58.453]  There's also a report on CNBC that they believe gold prices to double on paper market default.
[00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:00.074]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:06.441]  Fed considers plan to buy companies unsecured debt and states unsecured debt.
[00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:15.590]  So you've only seen the beginning of the takeover where tax money buys
[00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:20.891]  Securities buys different assets and hands it over to other private interests.
[00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:31.000]  By the way, former head of Goldman Sachs has hired the vice president from Goldman Sachs to head up handing out the multi-trillions.
[00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:34.603]  If you really read the bill, it's upwards of five trillion as we keep reporting.
[00:02:35.344 --> 00:02:36.685]  And we'll get into that as well.
[00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:40.329]  So this is a Goldman Sachs operation almost entirely.
[00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.052]  So we'll go over some of that news.
[00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.230]  Also, Delta Force Officers says U.S.
[00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.412]  officials stop plans to kill Bin Laden.
[00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:52.493]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:52.533 --> 00:03:02.738]  We have a clip there from 60 Minutes where they admit what we told you in my first 9-11 film.
[00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:04.438]  Well, the first 9-11 film, period.
[00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:07.360]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, put out just three months.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.163]  Well, the first version was put out two weeks after, but the final version was put out about three months after 9-11.
[00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:20.596]  And we break down there that Delta Force was not allowed to capture or kill Bin Laden.
[00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:22.939]  That was only one case of hundreds.
[00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:35.511]  And so I want to go back over that, but here is the Delta Force commander saying exactly what we told you close to seven years ago.
[00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:49.304]  And, uh, you know, in Illinois, Missouri, and other areas, like Connecticut, people have been threatened with arrest if they quote, uh, lie about Barack Obama.
[00:03:49.344 --> 00:03:51.546]  The police said they will come and charge you.
[00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:52.746]  That was in the newscast.
[00:03:53.487 --> 00:03:56.989]  Several of the newscast and news articles in the campaign confirmed that.
[00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.991]  But still, people were in denial about it.
[00:04:02.043 --> 00:04:06.725]  And then the prosecutors and county sheriffs had to back off of that, at least publicly.
[00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:17.371]  And now John McCain is using that police state tactic as a campaign point in new attack ads against Barack Obama.
[00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:29.417]  Meanwhile, the Times of London reports Corsi detained, deported from Kenyon, and the police told him when he arrived he was going to meet with one of
[00:04:30.726 --> 00:04:32.287]  Barack Obama's brothers.
[00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:36.308]  They told him, you're not allowed to come here and lie.
[00:04:37.808 --> 00:04:42.430]  And so he was arrested, detained, and thrown out of the country.
[00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.592]  And, uh, the local paper said it was being done on behalf of Lord Obama.
[00:04:49.352 --> 00:04:53.173]  So, uh, just amazing police state tactics.
[00:04:53.213 --> 00:04:55.054]  And look, I don't have a dog in this fight.
[00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:56.374]  I'm not for McCain or Obama.
[00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:58.015]  They're both in the world order.
[00:04:58.035 --> 00:04:58.875]  This is very serious.
[00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:03.716]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.138]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.402]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:05:09.702 --> 00:05:16.170]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.693]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:22.234]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[00:05:22.474 --> 00:05:27.116]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:30.977]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.718]  Travel less, meet online.
[00:05:32.838 --> 00:05:35.319]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[00:05:45.162 --> 00:05:47.284]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:05:47.304 --> 00:05:47.945]  And we knew what to do.
[00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:09.730]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.296]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:25.530]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.673]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:32.953 --> 00:06:36.015]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.035 --> 00:06:41.157]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:44.636]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:44.996 --> 00:06:50.838]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:51.038 --> 00:06:53.519]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:58.861]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.493]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:07:02.653 --> 00:07:09.335]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:17.757]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:07:17.997 --> 00:07:23.699]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:25.680]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.880]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:07:28.021 --> 00:07:32.282]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:07:32.442 --> 00:07:34.563]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:42.426]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:08:02.171 --> 00:08:08.213]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.373 --> 00:08:11.754]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:28.200]  We are steaming towards an interview in 22 minutes with Bob Chapin, then Mike Rivera, then Richard Seacook, and Webster Tarpley.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:33.863]  So four guests today, predominantly on the economy, what's happening around the world, and the unfolding police state.
[00:08:35.984 --> 00:08:46.330]  On the Dr. Corsi issue, love him or hate him, the mainstream media really won't attack Dr. Corsi on the claims he's made about
[00:08:47.478 --> 00:08:49.940]  Barack H. Obama.
[00:08:51.201 --> 00:08:56.525]  And I have said over and over again that John McCain is pure evil, pure New World Order.
[00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:03.530]  He wants to use the military on the streets of America for law enforcement, which just goes with the whole unfolding plan.
[00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.492]  These guys are just frontmen and puppets, so they push the agenda.
[00:09:08.574 --> 00:09:14.018]  I actually went and pulled up the YouTube clips and writings and votes of Obama in the State Senate
[00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:16.209]  And in the U.S.
[00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:19.871]  Senate, he is probably more anti-gun than even Chuck Schumer.
[00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.013]  It really is true that he wants to ban .308 rounds, .223 rounds.
[00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:26.754]  He wants to ban many types of rifles.
[00:09:29.415 --> 00:09:31.475]  And I have not heard that from John McCain.
[00:09:32.696 --> 00:09:35.377]  And I try to control myself.
[00:09:35.597 --> 00:09:37.718]  I try to not get pulled into the left-right paradigm.
[00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:58.906]  I personally, you know, just on the surface with public relations, you know, their public relations, their propaganda, I, you know, have that deep-seated white guilt that I can't fully throw off, which we're all indoctrinated with, to where, you know, I'd like to have a black president and say, see, we don't care.
[00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:01.267]  I'd like to be able to support Barack Obama.
[00:10:01.287 --> 00:10:04.789]  I'd like to be able to say he's a good guy, but he is a gun banner.
[00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.272]  His dad is a Muslim.
[00:10:07.352 --> 00:10:08.913]  He was raised in Muslim schools.
[00:10:08.973 --> 00:10:10.594]  He was born in a foreign country.
[00:10:10.995 --> 00:10:12.896]  They are engaging in police state tactics.
[00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:17.519]  And Barack Obama will get mass support.
[00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:18.680]  That's what he has.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.761]  And Webster Tarpley has been right about that.
[00:10:23.103 --> 00:10:24.184]  He has been right about that.
[00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:27.366]  And by the way, Webster's not some, you know, right-winger.
[00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:32.049]  He's what I'd call a progressive classical leftist who's transcended the
[00:10:35.553 --> 00:10:39.214]  Eugenics, social engineering arm of the Democratic Party.
[00:10:39.254 --> 00:10:44.075]  He will admit it's pure evil and there for eugenics and there to break up the family and destroy things.
[00:10:44.755 --> 00:10:49.896]  He believes that you could have a big government, though, that was run by good people that would uplift humanity.
[00:10:50.276 --> 00:10:51.536]  It just doesn't work that way.
[00:10:51.596 --> 00:10:56.357]  But the point is, is that he's not some right-winger with an axe to grind.
[00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:59.838]  Like, he wrote the unauthorized biography of George Bush back in the early 90s.
[00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:21.554]  Back in 1991, which is the definitive work on the Nazi connections that are now on the BBC and Associated Press, and is now admitted fact, and we've been to the National Archives and confirmed that more research has been added, and we cover it in my 2005 film, 9-1-1, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:11:21.574 --> 00:11:23.756]  But the point here is, is that
[00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:27.389]  It is true that McCain has no grassroots real support.
[00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.951]  He doesn't have mindless worshipping zombies.
[00:11:31.512 --> 00:11:34.053]  Mainline conservatives don't trust him, don't like him.
[00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:35.974]  They know he's for open borders.
[00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:37.275]  They know he's for gun control.
[00:11:37.335 --> 00:11:40.056]  They know he's for carbon taxes and the rest of it.
[00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:46.355]  And so, they're wise to him, but they're holding their nose, thinking they're going to vote for him.
[00:11:46.395 --> 00:11:47.136]  Hey, it doesn't matter.
[00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:50.677]  The electronic voting machines are going to put in who the establishment wants.
[00:11:51.137 --> 00:11:56.458]  Now, they've only got about 40% of the country with the fraud systems that we can document that do steal elections.
[00:11:56.978 --> 00:11:57.899]  See, this is how it works.
[00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:09.922]  The Democrats think it's a partisan thing that George Bush was put in, and that the Supreme Court appointed him, and that the election was stolen in many states like Ohio,
[00:12:11.221 --> 00:12:18.746]  And New Mexico and places and it was proven and people went to jail and but still the election wasn't reversed.
[00:12:18.827 --> 00:12:21.328]  So yes, George Bush stole both elections.
[00:12:21.869 --> 00:12:24.030]  But that's only one level to it.
[00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:27.553]  You've got to be sophisticated if you're ever going to beat these people.
[00:12:28.834 --> 00:12:30.655]  That was because we had eight years of Bill Clinton.
[00:12:31.075 --> 00:12:32.616]  They needed to pass the baton.
[00:12:32.636 --> 00:12:36.019]  The conservatives said, give us anything but, you know, another quote, liberal.
[00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:40.602]  Then Bush comes in and gives you tripling the size of government, tripling the size of the BATF.
[00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:49.962]  Doubling the size of the welfare agencies, and of the CPS, and just a reign of terror against liberty, voting with the Democrats.
[00:12:52.364 --> 00:13:04.934]  And so now they need to give you a fresh face, you know, a handsome, smiling, brown face, with, you know, shining eyes, compared to McCain.
[00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:09.358]  I mean, Obama doesn't have that much fire or
[00:13:11.778 --> 00:13:17.959]  Charisma compared to a white Baptist preacher, or black Baptist preacher, but he's got a little bit of it.
[00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:22.000]  And that's a lot more than John McCain, that individual.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.321]  Over 90% of people die who get the type of cancer he had.
[00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:31.802]  And even a lower percentage live more than 10 years, even after it's in remission.
[00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:38.623]  He is nine years after his lymphomas being removed, the lymph nodes being removed.
[00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:41.503]  Doesn't look good.
[00:13:41.803 --> 00:13:42.764]  But it's like Bob Dole.
[00:13:42.804 --> 00:13:47.085]  They ran a corpse against Bill Clinton in 1996.
[00:13:49.986 --> 00:13:52.407]  And so, that's what's happening right now.
[00:13:52.707 --> 00:14:00.970]  And they did arrest the individual that claims he was the gay lover of Barack Obama.
[00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:04.131]  I have no doubt that it's probably true.
[00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:05.332]  Larry Sinclair.
[00:14:06.764 --> 00:14:13.569]  They did arrest him at the National Press Club, and Joe Biden's son arrested him, and a minute later it was trumped up, and the charges were dropped.
[00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:20.274]  They are arresting and harassing and shutting down websites of people, especially Democrats that don't like Obama.
[00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:23.537]  And I mean, I have to call it what it is.
[00:14:25.578 --> 00:14:26.319]  I have to call it.
[00:14:27.276 --> 00:14:36.600]  What it is, and it's just like Margaret Sanger said, the elite had to go out and hire black leaders to sell eugenics and breaking up the family and getting blacks on welfare.
[00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:38.001]  And blacks weren't stupid.
[00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:48.906]  A lot of the real leaders said, this is the government taking control, putting us back on a reservation, the plantation, this is just like they went to the Native Americans and said we're going to give you money and take care of you and move you over here.
[00:14:49.266 --> 00:14:50.627]  It's the same system.
[00:14:51.407 --> 00:14:52.268]  But they sent in huge
[00:14:53.957 --> 00:14:58.541]  Cores of black leaders paid off to lead the black community into destruction.
[00:15:00.023 --> 00:15:05.868]  And I don't agree with some of the things he says, but on the majority of the issues, Louis Farrakhan is actually right about that.
[00:15:06.229 --> 00:15:06.949]  And he will tell you.
[00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:14.216]  But notice he's pulled into the hype, and he knows it would politically destroy him if he didn't fall at the feet of Barack Obama, and so he has.
[00:15:16.038 --> 00:15:16.899]  This is about power.
[00:15:19.376 --> 00:15:46.993]  and uh... so let me just say you're not going to really have a choice on who gets elected either way we are in deep trouble corsi detained deported from kenya the times of london a leading american neoconservative author have been detained by immigration authorities in kenya as he tried to launch a book smearing barack obama see how even the headline is is leaning towards corsi out of england drum corsi of swift boat veterans for truth fame
[00:15:47.754 --> 00:15:54.636]  Was this morning being held after failing to reckon with Obama-mania.
[00:15:54.696 --> 00:15:56.077]  It's like they're laughing in the newspaper.
[00:15:56.697 --> 00:16:14.723]  He had been planning to launch his book entitled The Obama Nation, left his politics and the cult of personality before traveling to one of the slums to donate money to the Senator's half-brother, George, who was found living in a squalid condition two months ago.
[00:16:16.098 --> 00:16:22.681]  Yeah, you know, I have a little bit of family who doesn't do well financially, and I don't have a lot of money, but I give them as much money as I can.
[00:16:22.701 --> 00:16:26.742]  I can't imagine not trying to take care of your family.
[00:16:26.762 --> 00:16:29.404]  It's just another horrible thing.
[00:16:30.664 --> 00:16:37.787]  But officers swooped hours after Dr. Corsi was described as author of a smear crusade by local newspapers.
[00:16:38.327 --> 00:16:43.289]  Immigration officials claim he had been detained because he did not have a work permit.
[00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:44.990]  However, one of Corsi's assistants says
[00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:48.942]  He was just answering some questions.
[00:16:49.622 --> 00:16:50.783]  You know, as a journalist, to be there.
[00:16:51.003 --> 00:16:59.606]  That's what Canada said when they grabbed me and detained me for 15 hours and Aaron Dykes and Ryan Slick Eisen and threatened to put us in prison and laughed at us and cussed and screamed at us.
[00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:03.587]  And then they said, you're here to cover the conference, aren't you?
[00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:08.989]  And started screaming at us that we weren't going to be allowed to cover Bilderberg and bleeping this and effing that.
[00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.091]  Until Jim Tucker showed up with the CBC.
[00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:25.976]  We were supposed to meet with Jim, and they didn't confiscate one of our phones, they did confiscate two of them, and the call got through in the holding area.
[00:17:26.997 --> 00:17:32.500]  We were able, when Tucker started calling us, to go, oh, call Tucker.
[00:17:33.301 --> 00:17:42.727]  And Tucker, within an hour, drug his butt out of bed at 5 a.m., went down to the CBC offices where he was meeting later that morning,
[00:17:43.402 --> 00:17:44.082]  With a reporter.
[00:17:44.542 --> 00:17:46.123]  He got there early when she showed up.
[00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:49.564]  They got with a camera crew and a radio crew and came down.
[00:17:49.584 --> 00:17:50.985]  Because the main offices are there.
[00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:57.087]  In uh... In uh... Ottawa.
[00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:00.108]  Capital of Canada.
[00:18:01.869 --> 00:18:06.151]  And they showed up and got us out of there about, I don't know, five, six hours later.
[00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.131]  One o'clock in the afternoon.
[00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:09.152]  And they were so angry.
[00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:12.824]  And so I really can't ever go back to Canada.
[00:18:13.064 --> 00:18:14.305]  They told me I'm in their system.
[00:18:14.986 --> 00:18:19.169]  And they leaned over and just basically told me that, uh, don't ever come back to Canada.
[00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.392]  Because next time you won't be so lucky.
[00:18:25.374 --> 00:18:26.215]  I remember them laughing.
[00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:33.481]  We're going through all three of our laptops saying, we're gonna find porn, we're gonna find porn, you're gonna go to prison, you're gonna spend five years in a Canadian prison.
[00:18:34.202 --> 00:18:36.224]  You're gonna spend years before you even go to trial, because that's what they do.
[00:18:36.264 --> 00:18:38.626]  It's really tyrannical up there, but the public doesn't know about it.
[00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.772]  Um, because the media doesn't cover it usually.
[00:18:41.792 --> 00:18:45.555]  And I remember saying, what do you mean porn?
[00:18:46.255 --> 00:18:55.262]  And they said any porn, as much as a topless pinup picture, and that's transporting porn in here, and thank God no one in the office had visited porn.
[00:18:56.063 --> 00:18:58.205]  What office would you imagine to have three computers, nothing on it?
[00:18:58.265 --> 00:19:05.230]  By the grace of God, there was nothing on any of it, not so much as a swimsuit girl, and they were so angry.
[00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:08.213]  And they got the memory sticks out of our cameras.
[00:19:09.495 --> 00:19:15.199]  Looked at them and... You know, they would grab member sticks out and say, what's on these?
[00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:16.640]  And I'd say, they're clean.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.101]  They're empty.
[00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:20.042]  You effing liar!
[00:19:20.082 --> 00:19:23.504]  When I find photos on here, I'm charging you for lying to a federal official!
[00:19:24.885 --> 00:19:29.948]  Then they'd pop them in and it'd be clear and he'd start breathing heavy, little bastard in a black uniform.
[00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:33.971]  They'd love to be able to taser me to death like they do people routinely in those facilities.
[00:19:34.692 --> 00:19:35.372]  I'm lucky they didn't.
[00:19:36.946 --> 00:19:38.767]  Well, they got Corsi in Africa right now.
[00:19:39.427 --> 00:19:40.628]  Went out and found him in the city.
[00:19:41.248 --> 00:19:41.889]  Drug him in.
[00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.351]  Read the details at Infowars.com.
[00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:47.872]  Tell you about the Delta Force when we get back.

[00:19:57.718 --> 00:20:00.119]  Now it's on mainstream television.
[00:20:01.028 --> 00:20:05.451]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:10.855]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[00:20:11.415 --> 00:20:13.236]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[00:20:13.697 --> 00:20:15.778]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[00:20:16.399 --> 00:20:19.060]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:20.902]  Know how to reach campus security.
[00:20:21.342 --> 00:20:24.444]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[00:20:24.884 --> 00:20:27.186]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:04.805]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:04.985 --> 00:21:17.270]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.091]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:23.673]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.113 --> 00:21:26.334]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:29.256]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:29.276 --> 00:21:32.137]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:32.277 --> 00:21:38.621]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:38.701 --> 00:21:42.042]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:48.466]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.026 --> 00:21:53.067]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.167 --> 00:21:55.328]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.128 --> 00:21:58.769]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:58.789 --> 00:22:03.791]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:07.032]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:22:07.372 --> 00:22:09.353]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:22:10.013 --> 00:22:11.073]  But who is the enemy?
[00:22:11.553 --> 00:22:12.094]  Bin Laden.
[00:22:12.534 --> 00:22:13.294]  This is his MO.
[00:22:13.314 --> 00:22:14.715]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:16.135]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:22:16.695 --> 00:22:23.458]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:22:23.858 --> 00:22:24.299]  Some U.S.
[00:22:24.339 --> 00:22:30.081]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:22:30.681 --> 00:22:34.143]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:34.403 --> 00:22:44.449]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:45.430]  Fabled enemies.

[00:23:04.954 --> 00:23:11.397]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper than dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:12.838]  Here is why.
[00:23:13.518 --> 00:23:23.443]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:23:23.963 --> 00:23:26.344]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:23:26.704 --> 00:23:28.784]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:29.324]  this fall?
[00:23:29.804 --> 00:23:30.304]  Don't wait.

[00:23:59.031 --> 00:23:59.591]  Act now!
[00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:06.213]  Finishing up with the attack on free speech by the Obama zombies.
[00:24:08.869 --> 00:24:09.550]  They mean well.
[00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:16.574]  They think carrying out tyranny will save us from the great evil of George Bush, but it's both parties that are bought and paid for by the same interest.
[00:24:16.634 --> 00:24:24.479]  And when George Bush was having warrantless wiretaps, and still is, the American people, and setting up this control grid and butchering the Bill of Rights, we were against it.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.501]  We were against it when Bill Clinton did it.
[00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:30.323]  And now it looks like it'll probably be Barack H. Obama.
[00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:33.065]  Who knows who's gonna win?
[00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:35.066]  It doesn't matter in the final equation.
[00:24:35.086 --> 00:24:37.368]  The point is, we have to say no to this tyranny.
[00:24:39.088 --> 00:24:48.311]  Now, CBS News is now reporting only a very small part of a larger, important story that needs to be told.
[00:24:48.331 --> 00:25:00.195]  6,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda cream, as they were described by the Times of London, and other publications were flown out to safety in what's called the airlift of evil in the first two months of the Afghan invasion.
[00:25:01.056 --> 00:25:06.238]  You see, the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban leadership had been on the CIA payroll back since at least 1978.
[00:25:08.163 --> 00:25:10.024]  And so the real guys, they got out of the country.
[00:25:10.444 --> 00:25:12.105]  And they would arrest a few religious leaders.
[00:25:12.165 --> 00:25:22.211]  In fact, the one big leader they arrested was the guy who... the cleric who offered to turn bin Laden in, offered to try to help, warn the U.S.
[00:25:22.291 --> 00:25:26.613]  in the weeks before, because he heard the chatter, which of course was a setup, a story being planted.
[00:25:27.153 --> 00:25:31.796]  So whoever waited, and with open arms for the U.S., they got grabbed and sent to Gitmo.
[00:25:32.628 --> 00:25:35.790]  But then the real Taliban and Al-Qaeda, they got flown out to safety.
[00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.953]  And special forces would capture number two in Taliban, number four in Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:40.373 --> 00:25:48.358]  And they'd be ordered to release them, give them money, give them food, put them in trucks, escort them to the border of Pakistan, put them in C-130s.
[00:25:48.438 --> 00:25:55.742]  And there were special forces colonels in the San Francisco Chronicle and in all these articles.
[00:25:55.782 --> 00:25:57.243]  I mean, they were hopping mad.
[00:25:58.504 --> 00:25:59.685]  A few years later, that's what
[00:26:01.747 --> 00:26:03.708]  That's what upset Pat Tillman so much.
[00:26:04.749 --> 00:26:16.917]  Of course, we've had former Army folks, Rangers and others on who talk about staging, you know, shootouts with Al-Qaeda and Taliban, with CNN, where they would just go to a base and then fire their weapons like they were fighting somebody.
[00:26:18.878 --> 00:26:30.065]  Now, Delta Force, patriotic guys, attached basically to the CIA and the National Security Council, they get paired up with this Taliban leader,
[00:26:30.939 --> 00:26:39.204]  Who's supposedly going to help them hunt Bin Laden, and you hear the Delta Force commander on 60 Minutes saying it was like it was staged.
[00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:44.508]  It was like they would have these staged firefights with Bin Laden's people, and then they would never help us.
[00:26:45.268 --> 00:26:47.890]  And this is who the CIA picked and paid to aid them.
[00:26:49.631 --> 00:26:58.597]  And then it turned out the CIA would pay $25,000, in some cases more, per head for 14-year-old innocent kids to send to Gitmo and then release the real people.
[00:26:59.452 --> 00:27:00.673]  So, it's a long piece.
[00:27:00.713 --> 00:27:02.314]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:03.035 --> 00:27:04.056]  But here's a few minutes of it.
[00:27:05.077 --> 00:27:13.924]  Shortly after 9-11, the Pentagon ordered a top-secret team of American commandos into Afghanistan with a single, simple order.
[00:27:14.464 --> 00:27:16.066]  Kill Osama Bin Laden.
[00:27:16.566 --> 00:27:20.069]  It was America's best chance to eliminate the leader of Al-Qaeda.
[00:27:20.929 --> 00:27:28.836]  The inside story of exactly what happened in that mission and how close it came to its objective has never been told until tonight.
[00:27:29.531 --> 00:27:32.572]  The man you're about to meet was the officer in command.
[00:27:33.012 --> 00:27:34.453]  Leading a team from the U.S.
[00:27:34.593 --> 00:27:36.634]  Army's mysterious Delta Force.
[00:27:37.074 --> 00:27:41.435]  A unit so secret, it's often said that Delta doesn't exist.
[00:27:42.075 --> 00:27:45.257]  But you're about to see Delta's operators in action.
[00:27:45.937 --> 00:27:49.118]  Why would the mission commander break his silence after seven years?
[00:27:49.738 --> 00:27:54.600]  He told us that most everything he's read in the media is wrong.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.741]  And tonight, he wants to set the record straight.
[00:27:58.985 --> 00:28:01.907]  Our job is to go find them, capture a killer... Hey, back that up!
[00:28:02.207 --> 00:28:14.595]  People, Star Conspiracy Theories, we're recording that off the web, it buffered, so there's a few breakups in this, but you can go watch it all for yourself again on InfoWars.com or at the CBS 60 Minutes site, so back it up a few seconds and play it again.
[00:28:15.842 --> 00:28:18.684]  It's often said that Delta doesn't exist.
[00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:22.506]  But you're about to see Delta's operators in action.
[00:28:23.186 --> 00:28:26.368]  Why would the mission commander break his silence after seven years?
[00:28:27.008 --> 00:28:31.871]  He told us that most everything he's read in the media is wrong.
[00:28:32.371 --> 00:28:34.993]  And tonight, he wants to set the record straight.
[00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:41.164]  Our job is to go find him, capture and kill him, and we knew the writing on the wall was really to kill him.
[00:28:41.605 --> 00:28:46.588]  No one wanted to bring Osama Bin Laden back to stand trial in the United States somewhere.
[00:28:46.748 --> 00:28:54.773]  In 2001, just 10 weeks after 9-11, he was a 37-year-old Army major leading a team of America's most elite commandos.
[00:28:55.394 --> 00:28:58.456]  Even now, we can't tell you his name or show you his face.
[00:28:59.927 --> 00:29:07.914]  We hired a theatrical makeup artist to take the former Delta officer through a series of transformations to create the man you see now.
[00:29:08.695 --> 00:29:10.496]  He calls himself Dalton Fury.
[00:29:10.796 --> 00:29:14.139]  He's the author of Kill Bin Laden, a new book out this week.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.042]  Dalton Fury is used to disguises.
[00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:23.367]  In fact, in 2001, his entire team transformed itself in Afghanistan.
[00:29:24.224 --> 00:29:30.506]  Everybody has their beard grown, everybody's wearing local Afghan clothing, sometimes carrying the same weapons as them.
[00:29:30.846 --> 00:29:39.328]  The idea was that if this all worked out, Osama Bin Laden would be dead and no one would ever know that Delta Force was there.
[00:29:39.648 --> 00:29:42.968]  Alright, stay there folks, I'm going to play a little bit more of this and finish my comments on it.
[00:29:42.988 --> 00:29:47.790]  We'll go to Bob Chapman and the latest economic developments with the stock market plunging as we speak.
[00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:49.250]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.087 --> 00:29:52.008]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.468 --> 00:29:54.089]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.772]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.254 --> 00:30:02.895]  High gasoline prices got you down?
[00:30:03.396 --> 00:30:05.497]  Is your vehicle not getting the mileage it used to?
[00:30:06.318 --> 00:30:11.442]  Poor quality gasoline and the addition of ethanol plugs your fuel injectors and slowly robs fuel economy.
[00:30:12.002 --> 00:30:15.004]  Mechanics charge up to $300 to clean your fuel system.

[00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:54.910]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:55.571]  A new world order.
[00:30:55.611 --> 00:30:58.273]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.121]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:12.821 --> 00:31:15.042]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:18.023]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:31:18.783 --> 00:31:26.105]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.128 --> 00:31:34.110]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:38.051]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.091 --> 00:31:40.973]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.013 --> 00:31:42.133]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.173 --> 00:31:42.933]  They're not after money.
[00:31:42.953 --> 00:31:44.054]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.254 --> 00:31:44.974]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.214 --> 00:31:46.255]  That's what they have to do.
[00:31:46.375 --> 00:31:54.578]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:54.718 --> 00:31:57.659]  Endgame, prepped for global enslavement.
[00:31:57.859 --> 00:31:59.060]  You have been warned.
[00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:16.830]  We're good to go.
[00:32:32.637 --> 00:32:32.717]  No.
[00:32:32.877 --> 00:32:34.318]  We know one thing's certain right now.
[00:32:34.358 --> 00:32:38.200]  We're headed into much higher prices on food, and there is a global food shortage.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.460]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.281]  Do what I did.
[00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:41.922]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[00:32:42.042 --> 00:32:44.723]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[00:32:44.843 --> 00:32:46.624]  Get some food and put it away, and be safe.

[00:32:48.285 --> 00:32:49.365]  You deserve security.

[00:32:50.446 --> 00:32:50.946]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:32:50.966 --> 00:32:51.046]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:51.166 --> 00:32:51.846]  Put some food away.
[00:32:51.866 --> 00:32:52.327]  Do it now.
[00:32:52.347 --> 00:32:52.407]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:33:15.896 --> 00:33:29.371]  I've got to run to keep from hattin' And I'm bound to keep on ridin' I've got one more silver dollar
[00:33:49.628 --> 00:33:50.251]  Yeah.
[00:34:03.339 --> 00:34:09.621]  Bob Chapman's legendary for getting time zones mixed up.
[00:34:09.662 --> 00:34:10.582]  He'll probably call in.
[00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:12.263]  He always calls in earlier.
[00:34:12.303 --> 00:34:15.284]  He calls in during another section of the show.
[00:34:15.444 --> 00:34:17.845]  Probably when Rivero's on next hour, I predict he'll call in.
[00:34:17.945 --> 00:34:19.986]  If not, he'll call in any minute from now.
[00:34:20.126 --> 00:34:22.887]  I'm going to go over the economic news regardless here in a few minutes.
[00:34:22.907 --> 00:34:26.888]  We've got Mike Rivero coming up in about 27 minutes.
[00:34:26.988 --> 00:34:28.469]  Webster Tarpley, then Richard C. Cook.
[00:34:30.937 --> 00:34:33.238]  On this 7th day of October 2008.
[00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:41.019]  So we're playing some excerpts from CBS News to analyze it and comment on it, critique it.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:59.424]  They have this Delta Force commander who is describing how he's spoken up after 7 years because never in his 5 years with Delta Force and that means many years previously either with Army Special Forces
[00:35:00.129 --> 00:35:04.011]  The Marines or the Navy SEALs, as they take from all those groups, the best.
[00:35:05.011 --> 00:35:11.293]  That he had never, you know, come up with an operational plan in the field and had the higher-ups then say no to it.
[00:35:12.494 --> 00:35:14.855]  Now, this story is being reported in a vacuum.
[00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:24.799]  You have more than 20 cases of Predator drones and others over who they said was Bin Laden or other top Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:27.620]  Al-Cieda.
[00:35:30.004 --> 00:35:35.045]  And the CIA orders the Air Force not to bomb them.
[00:35:37.546 --> 00:35:49.308]  And again, you have the other, just regular Army, regular Special Forces, the Green Berets, the Rangers below them, would capture people in order to release them.
[00:35:49.728 --> 00:35:50.488]  Over and over again.
[00:35:50.528 --> 00:35:52.329]  It was a staged war.
[00:35:53.529 --> 00:35:57.650]  What Al Qaeda did is they would go grab conscripts out of the cities.
[00:35:58.809 --> 00:36:01.150]  And they would put them on the front lines in three rings.
[00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:04.813]  And then the Northern Alliance would ask the U.S.
[00:36:05.753 --> 00:36:14.758]  and the British troops alongside them in the north, why are we only shelling the first ring of defenses and not the second or third?
[00:36:16.559 --> 00:36:24.164]  Because it was only for 15, 16-year-olds to die who had been forced out of the mountains from their goat herding and thrown a Kalashnikov.
[00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.973]  It was a staged intelligence operation in a country run by the New World Order.
[00:36:30.474 --> 00:36:32.155]  Boy, now look at opium production exploding.
[00:36:33.436 --> 00:36:34.677]  And it's come out that British and U.S.
[00:36:34.697 --> 00:36:36.338]  troops guard the poppies.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.080]  It's so evil.
[00:36:40.701 --> 00:36:41.622]  And it's in your face.
[00:36:43.163 --> 00:36:45.505]  And so when you hear about this, remember the airlift of evil.
[00:36:46.546 --> 00:36:49.848]  6,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda in a two-day period flown out to safety.
[00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.650]  Out of Kandahar, out of Kabul.
[00:36:54.446 --> 00:37:03.191]  So then they have to have, you know, this legendary story about Bin Laden up in the hills, up on the Pakistan border in the high mountains.
[00:37:04.572 --> 00:37:09.474]  And, you know, the satellites and infrared can't spot him, can't kill him, but the truth is they did.
[00:37:10.535 --> 00:37:13.336]  Quote, who they claimed was Bin Laden, and they would always say no to killing him.
[00:37:13.797 --> 00:37:20.120]  The info we've got is that he was dying right around that time in Dubai at the American hospital.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.381]  It's called the American Hospital.
[00:37:22.426 --> 00:37:27.629]  And that was reported by mainstream press in Europe, in France, in the Middle East, and in England.
[00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:34.293]  And of course, Bin Laden, the CIA asset, going back until the early 1980s, codenamed Tim Osman.
[00:37:35.454 --> 00:37:49.483]  And so, the Delta Force is sent in, and then over and over again they're told, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:37:52.282 --> 00:37:54.203]  9-11, the Rotterdam, let's finish up playing some of this.
[00:37:55.004 --> 00:37:56.845]  And that always is when you're talking about Delta Force.
[00:37:57.725 --> 00:38:01.067]  And there was no mission more important to the United States.
[00:38:01.667 --> 00:38:02.948]  We'll smoke him out of his cave.
[00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:05.309]  And we'll get him eventually.
[00:38:05.969 --> 00:38:10.032]  But the administration's strategy was to let Afghans do most of the fighting.
[00:38:10.892 --> 00:38:18.236]  Using radio intercepts and other intelligence, the CIA pinpointed bin Laden in the mountains near the border of Pakistan.
[00:38:18.883 --> 00:38:28.932]  Following the strategy of keeping an Afghan face on the war, Fury's Delta team joined the CIA and Afghan fighters and piled into pickup trucks.
[00:38:29.673 --> 00:38:32.795]  They videotaped their journey to a place called Tora Bora.
[00:38:33.616 --> 00:38:39.461]  Fury told us his orders were to kill Bin Laden and leave the body with the Afghans.
[00:38:39.942 --> 00:38:45.927]  Right here, you're looking at basically the battlefield from the last location that we had firm on Osama Bin Laden's location.
[00:38:46.463 --> 00:38:51.024]  This ridgeline is at about 14,000 feet and back this way toward me is Pakistan.
[00:38:51.104 --> 00:38:51.524]  That's right.
[00:38:51.904 --> 00:38:57.386]  On a scale of say 1 to 10, 10 being the toughest, how tough a position is this to attack?
[00:38:58.806 --> 00:38:59.907]  In my experience it's a 10.
[00:39:01.107 --> 00:39:07.228]  Delta developed an audacious plan to come at Bin Laden from the one direction he would never expect.
[00:39:08.009 --> 00:39:09.069]  We want to come in on the back door.
[00:39:09.787 --> 00:39:11.768]  You were going to come up over the tops of the peaks?
[00:39:11.848 --> 00:39:12.228]  That's right.
[00:39:12.248 --> 00:39:23.715]  The original plan that we sent up to Ohio headquarters, Delta Force wants to come in, over the mountain with oxygen, coming from the Pakistan side, over the mountains and come in and get a drop on the line from behind.
[00:39:24.055 --> 00:39:25.836]  Why didn't you do that?
[00:39:25.876 --> 00:39:27.377]  Disapproved at some level above us.
[00:39:28.178 --> 00:39:32.300]  Whether that was Central Command or all the way up to the President of the United States, I'm not sure.
[00:39:32.967 --> 00:39:42.010]  The next option Delta wanted to employ was to drop hundreds of landmines in the mountain passes that led to Pakistan, Bin Laden's escape route.
[00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.730]  First guy blows his leg off, everybody else stops.
[00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.271]  That allows aircraft overhead to find them.
[00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:48.851]  They see all these heat sources out there.
[00:39:48.871 --> 00:39:51.432]  Okay, there's a big large group of al-Qaeda moving south.
[00:39:51.492 --> 00:39:52.332]  They can engage that.
[00:39:52.612 --> 00:39:53.353]  Why didn't you do that?
[00:39:53.673 --> 00:39:54.133]  Disapproved.
[00:39:55.813 --> 00:39:56.714]  Why was it not approved?
[00:39:57.354 --> 00:39:57.934]  I have no idea.
[00:39:59.378 --> 00:40:04.087]  How often does Delta come up with a tactical plan that's disapproved by higher headquarters?
[00:40:04.868 --> 00:40:07.853]  In my experience, in my five years at Delta, never before.
[00:40:08.795 --> 00:40:12.081]  The military wouldn't tell us who rejected the plans or why.
[00:40:12.774 --> 00:40:21.539]  Fury wasn't happy about it, but he pressed on with the only option he had left, a frontal assault on Bin Laden's dug-in Al-Qaeda fighters.
[00:40:22.279 --> 00:40:29.703]  The Delta team had only about 50 men, so the mission would depend on the Afghan militia as guides and muscle.
[00:40:30.364 --> 00:40:34.966]  Their leader was a warlord, a self-styled general named Ali.
[00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:36.187]  Ali told us
[00:40:37.049 --> 00:40:43.232]  After about 30 seconds of discussion, he kind of listened to me ramble on, and then the first thing he said was, I don't think you guys can handle it.
[00:40:43.572 --> 00:40:45.713]  You can't handle Al-Qaeda in these mountains.
[00:40:46.454 --> 00:40:53.657]  Ali, second from the left, met with this CIA officer, and accepted millions of dollars in cash from the agency.
[00:40:53.677 --> 00:40:54.638]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:40:54.678 --> 00:40:59.980]  Of course, you got the CIA playing the Delta Force like complete fools here.
[00:41:01.541 --> 00:41:05.283]  And here you've got this well-meaning Delta Force commander, it's clear to, easy to assess,
[00:41:06.334 --> 00:41:10.977]  He believes he's exposing bad command, but here's the government allowing him to release the videos.
[00:41:11.618 --> 00:41:21.445]  Here is the CENTCOM, the Pentagon, allowing all this to come out because it adds to the myth that Bin Laden was even in those mountains.
[00:41:23.586 --> 00:41:25.228]  Of course they couldn't let him go in and kill him.
[00:41:25.528 --> 00:41:32.753]  Of course they couldn't drop the big daisy cutters that would suck the air out of any cave or kill anybody for a mile around.
[00:41:33.414 --> 00:41:35.295]  Of course they wouldn't launch a real assault.
[00:41:35.922 --> 00:41:38.284]  It was totally staged.
[00:41:38.925 --> 00:41:41.787]  And see, if you just watched this TV program, you wouldn't know that.
[00:41:41.827 --> 00:41:43.329]  You would think, oh, this was just this one case.
[00:41:43.389 --> 00:41:44.330]  No, it was everywhere!
[00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:52.777]  And then all the jailbreaks, the staged jailbreaks they've had to release Al-Qaeda out of prisons in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan.
[00:41:53.078 --> 00:42:00.044]  Pakistani intelligence handling Al-Qaeda, sending them the money, meeting with... Well, Joe Biden in the week before 9-11.
[00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:02.106]  I mean, these people are sick.
[00:42:04.685 --> 00:42:05.646]  It's disgusting.
[00:42:07.607 --> 00:42:17.753]  And then you've got this guy who is completely well-meaning, basically like a well-bred hunting dog, who is just something that they play games with in the CIA.
[00:42:19.073 --> 00:42:24.416]  And so here he is thinking he's a whistleblower with his book, Kilbin Laden, and it just plays into the larger fairy tale.
[00:42:24.937 --> 00:42:26.438]  Until you have the other pieces of the puzzle.
[00:42:26.838 --> 00:42:28.759]  Continue with the mindslave.
[00:42:30.035 --> 00:42:37.240]  Ali, second from the left, met with this CIA officer and accepted millions of dollars in cash from the agency.
[00:42:37.861 --> 00:42:42.204]  In short order, his Mujahideen fighters were escorting Delta Force.
[00:42:42.224 --> 00:42:49.069]  Yeah, given millions of dollars by the CIA to lead Delta Force on a wild goose chase and not support them.
[00:42:50.376 --> 00:42:54.277]  This is video of the top secret mission never seen by the public before.
[00:42:54.297 --> 00:42:56.998]  It was recorded by the Delta Commandos themselves.
[00:43:16.974 --> 00:43:22.737]  Dressed like Afghans, the Americans maneuvered up the mountains, calling in airstrikes on Al Qaeda.
[00:43:23.337 --> 00:43:30.581]  By day, they would advance, but at night, they soon discovered that their Afghan allies went home.
[00:43:31.202 --> 00:43:40.907]  Well, I have to assume that if you started up the hills of Tora Bora, and the Mujahideen took territory, they didn't abandon that at night.
[00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.310]  Oh, yes they did.
[00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:43.731]  They gave it up to the enemy?
[00:43:43.951 --> 00:43:44.351]  Absolutely.
[00:43:44.371 --> 00:43:51.173]  The Mujahideen would go up, get into a skirmish, a firefight, lose a guy or two, maybe kill an Al-Qaeda guy or two, and then they'd leave.
[00:43:51.653 --> 00:43:55.055]  It was almost like it was an agreement and understanding between the two forces fighting each other.
[00:43:55.415 --> 00:43:56.615]  Almost put on a good show.
[00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:58.436]  Oh, rewind that!
[00:43:58.456 --> 00:44:02.157]  A good show, yeah, but you're seeing into one level of it.
[00:44:03.077 --> 00:44:08.039]  Are you strong enough mentally to understand history, Delta Force,
[00:44:08.815 --> 00:44:12.539]  And understand just how big a pawn you really are.
[00:44:22.808 --> 00:44:23.349]  Oh, yes they did.
[00:44:23.709 --> 00:44:24.770]  They gave it up to the enemy?
[00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.391]  Absolutely.
[00:44:25.411 --> 00:44:32.177]  The Mujahideen would go up, get into a skirmish, a firefight, lose a guy or two, maybe kill an Al-Qaeda guy or two, and then they'd leave.
[00:44:32.197 --> 00:44:36.101]  It was almost like it was an agreement, an understanding between the two forces fighting each other.
[00:44:36.462 --> 00:44:38.724]  Almost put on a good show, and then leave.
[00:44:39.405 --> 00:44:45.631]  Four days after arriving in Tora Bora, Dalton Fury was faced with a fateful command decision.
[00:44:46.357 --> 00:44:56.559]  Three of his men were in trouble behind enemy lines, and at the same time, the CIA had been listening to Bin Laden's radio transmissions and had a breakthrough.
[00:44:56.719 --> 00:44:57.319]  Oh, give me a break!
[00:44:57.339 --> 00:44:58.340]  This is where it gets complicated.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:06.201]  At about the same time, the CIA, George, comes into our room, and he says, Guys, I got a location for Osama Bin Laden.
[00:45:06.641 --> 00:45:09.962]  That's probably the best location data we've had on Osama Bin Laden ever.
[00:45:10.766 --> 00:45:13.728]  It was night, so Fury was without his Afghan allies.
[00:45:14.408 --> 00:45:20.991]  Still, he managed to rescue his men, and then found himself approaching Bin Laden's doorstep.
[00:45:21.471 --> 00:45:26.393]  We're about 2,000 meters away from where we think Bin Laden's at still, from where we're at.
[00:45:27.374 --> 00:45:28.394]  Now we have to make a decision.
[00:45:29.055 --> 00:45:30.315]  Fury had two choices.
[00:45:30.755 --> 00:45:36.018]  Advance his small team with no Afghan support, or return to camp and assault in the morning.
[00:45:36.869 --> 00:45:45.955]  He was under orders to make the Afghans take the lead, and intelligence said there were more than 1,000 hardened fighters protecting Bin Laden.
[00:45:46.455 --> 00:45:57.402]  You write in the book, my decision to abort that effort to kill or capture Bin Laden when we might have been within 2,000 meters of him, about 2,000 yards, still bothers me.
[00:45:58.812 --> 00:46:02.093]  It leaves me with a feeling of somehow letting down our nation.
[00:46:02.273 --> 00:46:03.413]  I mean, let me just stop.
[00:46:03.433 --> 00:46:06.494]  This goes against all military doctrine.
[00:46:06.514 --> 00:46:07.474]  This is pure bull.
[00:46:08.194 --> 00:46:13.796]  The 50 would have attacked from concealed positions and called in airstrikes against those thousand.
[00:46:13.996 --> 00:46:15.776]  That is pure bull!
[00:46:16.096 --> 00:46:25.619]  A two-year-old who knows anything about any military strategy and modern military strategy knows that is absolute garbage.
[00:46:27.389 --> 00:46:36.071]  Two rangers put in to radio and intelligence and call in airstrikes would have done that.
[00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:39.511]  This is pure bull.
[00:46:39.571 --> 00:46:40.392]  Let's go back to it.
[00:46:42.892 --> 00:46:49.233]  Had we gone up that ridgeline toward that location, Osama bin Laden might have been 500 meters away.
[00:46:49.433 --> 00:46:50.454]  We might have run right into him.
[00:46:51.234 --> 00:46:52.374]  So there's always that doubt.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.440]  That we might have run into him.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.141]  We also might have got up there.
[00:46:56.501 --> 00:46:59.402]  No, he was fighting for his life in Dubai, pal.
[00:46:59.842 --> 00:47:02.742]  Go ahead and rewind it back to the puppet.
[00:47:03.422 --> 00:47:04.363]  Cautious run into him.
[00:47:05.123 --> 00:47:08.344]  So there's always that doubt that we might have run into him.
[00:47:08.844 --> 00:47:10.984]  We also might have got up there and found nothing.
[00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:15.885]  It wasn't worth the risk at that particular moment to go up there and play cowboy.
[00:47:16.566 --> 00:47:17.666]  It was better to be cautious
[00:47:19.055 --> 00:47:19.535]  Oh yeah.
[00:47:20.016 --> 00:47:21.677]  Go up there with the entire force the next day.
[00:47:21.817 --> 00:47:22.617]  That's right, hit pause.
[00:47:22.777 --> 00:47:32.863]  You got somebody who supposedly killed 3,000 Americans, he has his $50 million bounty on his head, you're the Delta Force, and you are cautious.
[00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:35.204]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:37.892]  Now you notice they're making it all about that event.
[00:47:38.312 --> 00:47:43.297]  There were the other times where they quote had him in their sights and couldn't call in airstrikes or weren't allowed to go in.
[00:47:43.937 --> 00:47:46.960]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.161]  But forget this story.
[00:47:48.541 --> 00:47:49.582]  This is just more evidence.
[00:47:51.244 --> 00:47:52.605]  Research the airlift of evil.
[00:47:52.625 --> 00:47:59.331]  In fact, Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Aaron Dykes, Kurt Nemo, one of our writers, we ought to go back and pull all those airlift of evil stories.
[00:48:00.265 --> 00:48:04.428]  And then the special forces colonel that was in the papers in the U.S.
[00:48:04.468 --> 00:48:25.460]  saying we were ordered to stand down and how they flew them out to safety and how it was all staged and even the CIA commander who wrote Jawbreaker admits, like we had him on a few years ago, that they were told to just go grab innocent people and not get anybody real and fly them to Guantanamo Bay for a torture laboratory to test torture.
[00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:29.643]  That was one part, but also to show the public, look, it's men with beards.
[00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:30.850]  They did it.
[00:48:33.453 --> 00:48:34.513]  It's all about a show.
[00:48:34.613 --> 00:48:35.975]  It's all about theater.
[00:48:37.576 --> 00:48:38.236]  For the public.
[00:48:39.758 --> 00:48:40.618]  That's all they're doing.
[00:48:41.579 --> 00:48:42.280]  It's that simple.
[00:48:43.681 --> 00:48:45.202]  We're going to come back, cover the economy.
[00:48:46.403 --> 00:48:49.205]  And Mike Rivera is going to be all of us, and Webster Tarpley, Richard C. Cook.
[00:48:52.338 --> 00:48:54.119]  The public doesn't know about this.
[00:48:54.199 --> 00:48:55.299]  They still don't know.
[00:48:55.819 --> 00:48:59.641]  They saw Bush say, Bin Laden's our number one target, and a year later, who's Bin Laden?
[00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:00.781]  I don't care about Bin Laden.
[00:49:00.801 --> 00:49:01.962]  I'm not looking for Bin Laden.
[00:49:02.702 --> 00:49:03.422]  He actually said that.
[00:49:03.462 --> 00:49:04.523]  He said, so what?
[00:49:05.823 --> 00:49:06.963]  We're not really targeting him.
[00:49:07.724 --> 00:49:11.485]  Never forget Bandar Bush, his nickname, the Saudi ambassador at that time of Larry King Live.
[00:49:11.885 --> 00:49:15.787]  He was at 9-11 and best friends with the Bushes and Cheney and
[00:49:17.176 --> 00:49:22.998]  King was saying, Bin Laden's evil, Bin Laden's horrible, Bin Laden's bad, Bin Laden's a piece of trash, and Mandar said, how dare you say that about him?
[00:49:23.398 --> 00:49:26.539]  He's a great and honorable man, and he didn't even do 9-11.
[00:49:26.599 --> 00:49:31.441]  I mean, these are rock star in Saudi Arabia.
[00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:37.723]  See, who carried out the Afghan attack on the Russians starting in 79 to get the Russians to invade?
[00:49:39.964 --> 00:49:46.666]  It was the Saudis, the Israelis, and the United States matching funds and logistics to go in there and do that.
[00:49:47.563 --> 00:49:50.485]  And then Pakistan in the operation in 2001.
[00:49:51.305 --> 00:49:58.189]  This is a team that's covered in Fabled Enemies by Jason Bermas, the new film I just produced, that we hardly even plug.
[00:49:58.229 --> 00:50:01.430]  I should get it on DVD, folks, at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:03.311]  We're seeing super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:03.631 --> 00:50:04.472]  People need to see this.
[00:50:04.952 --> 00:50:05.772]  They need to know this.
[00:50:05.792 --> 00:50:07.013]  They need to understand it.
[00:50:08.354 --> 00:50:08.614]  Okay?
[00:50:09.355 --> 00:50:11.656]  They love far away places with big mountains.
[00:50:11.716 --> 00:50:16.379]  It's a nice backdrop far away where they can control it and give you whatever fairy tale they want.
[00:50:16.579 --> 00:50:18.320]  Just like they told the famous painter Remington.
[00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:20.181]  Hearst Publishing did.
[00:50:20.622 --> 00:50:23.103]  They said, you supply the pictures, I'll supply the war.
[00:50:23.663 --> 00:50:27.285]  Remington went down there and said, there's no massacres, no troops, nothing going on here.
[00:50:28.166 --> 00:50:29.327]  And he said, look, fake them.
[00:50:29.887 --> 00:50:36.011]  Fake paintings that we can then put into the newspaper.
[00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:38.392]  You supply the pictures, I'll supply the war.
[00:50:39.258 --> 00:50:39.779]  And that's it.
[00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:40.940]  A staged war.
[00:50:42.361 --> 00:50:45.444]  The only war going on in Afghanistan is warlords fighting over the opium.
[00:50:47.205 --> 00:50:47.806]  Just like the U.S.
[00:50:47.846 --> 00:50:50.128]  is running a war in Mexico to consolidate the drug trade.
[00:50:50.588 --> 00:50:51.589]  There's real casualties there.
[00:50:51.609 --> 00:50:53.611]  That's over drugs, money.
[00:50:54.172 --> 00:50:55.193]  Same thing in Afghanistan.
[00:50:56.454 --> 00:50:57.595]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:50:57.815 --> 00:50:58.315]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.343 --> 00:51:04.868]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to read?
[00:51:05.508 --> 00:51:06.149]  Of course not.
[00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:12.598]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:51:13.211 --> 00:51:18.054]  I'm Walt Augustinowicz, founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information you need to know.
[00:51:18.594 --> 00:51:23.398]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards, because they look physically just like the old card.
[00:51:23.798 --> 00:51:33.304]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with the card possible, right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing the card.
[00:51:33.644 --> 00:51:36.546]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[00:51:37.046 --> 00:51:42.308]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's why we manufacture the SecureSleeve.
[00:51:42.568 --> 00:51:49.030]  The SecureSleeve is a patent-pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier, preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:53.831]  You can get more information and purchase the SecureSleeve online at idstronghold.com.
[00:51:54.151 --> 00:51:57.372]  That's idstronghold.com, or call us at 800-610-2770.
[00:52:00.857 --> 00:52:07.220]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.601 --> 00:52:09.582]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.242 --> 00:52:11.282]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.783 --> 00:52:12.363]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.583 --> 00:52:13.524]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:13.544 --> 00:52:14.944]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:14.964 --> 00:52:16.405]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:16.945 --> 00:52:23.687]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.088 --> 00:52:24.548]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.588 --> 00:52:30.350]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:34.371]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:44.678]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:52:44.918 --> 00:52:45.659]  Fabled enemies.
[00:52:46.139 --> 00:52:53.464]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:53.564 --> 00:52:57.247]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.828 --> 00:53:04.631]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:09.775]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings accounts?
[00:53:09.975 --> 00:53:15.079]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[00:53:15.379 --> 00:53:17.261]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[00:53:17.461 --> 00:53:25.903]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEPs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:53:25.943 --> 00:53:30.584]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[00:53:30.924 --> 00:53:33.185]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[00:53:37.126 --> 00:53:42.089]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[00:53:42.569 --> 00:53:47.072]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question of when.
[00:53:47.532 --> 00:53:52.576]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[00:53:52.836 --> 00:53:53.676]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.
[00:53:53.696 --> 00:53:53.756]  1-866-323-5665.
[00:54:18.394 --> 00:54:32.641]  You know, they say the fruit is in the pudding.
[00:54:43.639 --> 00:54:50.225]  And if you go back and you listen to this radio show for the last 13 years, you will see stunning precision.
[00:54:52.127 --> 00:54:52.987]  But it's not hard.
[00:54:53.107 --> 00:54:57.251]  The master planners, much of their criminal operations are public.
[00:54:58.352 --> 00:55:10.963]  We know the tricks they play, we know the way they operate, we understand the enemy's modus operandi, their M.O., what makes them tick, and how they play different segments of the government and the culture off against each other.
[00:55:14.537 --> 00:55:19.559]  But 9-11 was a complete and total fiction, the entire thing.
[00:55:21.679 --> 00:55:24.740]  And that is now coming out more and more.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:30.402]  The public is now discovering the facts.
[00:55:31.802 --> 00:55:34.423]  And that is certainly the good news.
[00:55:35.884 --> 00:55:39.425]  Alright, right now the stock market is plunging yet again.
[00:55:42.148 --> 00:55:42.809]  It is at 9,760 points.
[00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:47.853]  So the way this worked is it lost 800 points and gained about 400 back.
[00:55:47.873 --> 00:55:48.633]  Now it's lost about 200 points or 195.14.
[00:55:48.673 --> 00:55:52.657]  So we're looking at a 600 point drop now in the last two days and it's going straight down right now.
[00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:10.740]  All by design.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:22.487]  They need to blow the economy out, and then they will take the dollar currency, they will buy up all the real assets while it still has a little bit of value, and then they will pass on the hyperinflation to the American people and the people of the world.
[00:56:24.068 --> 00:56:25.849]  The dollar will die as the world reserve currency.
[00:56:25.869 --> 00:56:27.650]  They're going to set up a new global currency.
[00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:28.591]  We told you they'd do that.
[00:56:28.671 --> 00:56:30.852]  Now they're announcing that that is indeed the plan.
[00:56:31.572 --> 00:56:34.214]  Polls say 60% say depression is likely.
[00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:41.160]  Poll finds 6 out of 10 believe depression is somewhat very likely, seeing 25% unemployment and millions of homeless and hungry.
[00:56:42.441 --> 00:56:48.868]  CNN reports nearly 6 out of 10 Americans believe either economic depression is likely, according to a poll released last night.
[00:56:48.888 --> 00:56:56.656]  The CNN Opinion Research Poll, which surveyed more than 1,000 Americans over the weekend, cited common measures of the economic pain of the 1930s.
[00:56:58.243 --> 00:57:03.108]  25% unemployment rate, widespread bank failures, and millions of Americans homeless and unable to feed their families.
[00:57:03.128 --> 00:57:07.512]  Now remember, it's a select inner group of banks imploding the other banks to consolidate them.
[00:57:09.114 --> 00:57:13.958]  In response, 21% of those polls say the depression is very likely, and another 30% say it is somewhat likely.
[00:57:13.978 --> 00:57:18.803]  The poll also found that 29% feel the depression is not very likely, while 13% believe it's not likely at all.
[00:57:20.865 --> 00:57:21.586]  But economists
[00:57:23.175 --> 00:57:26.898]  Even many who feel current economic risk are dire generally don't believe another depression is likely.
[00:57:26.918 --> 00:57:33.083]  Yeah, they'll just tell you it's not a depression as they get the third army ready to deal with the American people.
[00:57:33.763 --> 00:57:40.969]  But again, they're going to implode things so bad over the next few years when riots and things break out that we will beg for the military.
[00:57:41.889 --> 00:57:45.872]  They're not going to unfurl a black flag of death and announce we're the evil New World Order.
[00:57:45.892 --> 00:57:47.213]  They've got to brainwash the troops.
[00:57:47.774 --> 00:57:49.195]  They've got to sell them on the mission.
[00:57:51.721 --> 00:57:55.164]  No, it'll be helping women, helping children, giving people hot meals.
[00:57:56.465 --> 00:58:03.752]  And of course, doing some intelligence ops, arresting militia terrorists who don't like what's happening.
[00:58:04.793 --> 00:58:10.798]  The militia terrorists, of course it'll be the government, will attack food convoys and steal it.
[00:58:10.818 --> 00:58:14.862]  And the mindless public will swell up full of rage.
[00:58:16.223 --> 00:58:17.985]  And then the mass arrests can start.
[00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:25.334]  The 26,000 preachers hired to teach their flock to submit to tyranny can fully activate.
[00:58:26.615 --> 00:58:29.597]  And then they can have a national draft and use the U.S.
[00:58:29.637 --> 00:58:33.360]  population as the Hessian Merc Force for New World Order, Inc.
[00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:36.442]  We'll be right back with Mike Rivera.
[00:58:36.462 --> 00:58:43.066]  Let's go ahead and get him on the line from Hawaii.
[00:58:43.106 --> 00:58:44.307]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.327 --> 00:58:47.930]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:56.585 --> 00:58:58.166]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:58:58.226 --> 00:58:59.367]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:58:59.387 --> 00:59:00.988]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:59:01.088 --> 00:59:03.909]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:59:03.969 --> 00:59:08.212]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:59:08.412 --> 00:59:17.237]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[00:59:17.257 --> 00:59:22.420]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:59:30.017 --> 00:59:33.440]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.942]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:59:36.102 --> 00:59:42.786]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.452]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:59:53.614 --> 00:59:55.555]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.996 --> 00:59:58.798]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.405 --> 01:00:06.026]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.706 --> 01:00:07.787]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.488 --> 01:00:09.609]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.229 --> 01:00:11.070]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:12.691]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:17.015]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.575 --> 01:00:21.698]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:30.485]  Well, they got a coffee cup over at WhatReallyHappened.com that reads, the last official act of a corrupt government is to loot the country.
[01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:36.578]  The International Bank of Settlements stated two years ago that they were going to implode the U.S.
[01:00:36.658 --> 01:00:37.578]  markets by design.
[01:00:37.598 --> 01:00:43.882]  Almost three years ago, we reported from Bilderberg that that was also the plan, and exactly as we laid it out, is how it's now happening.
[01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:54.128]  Immunity for the crimes of the bankers, the power to shut down and take over other financial institutions that are actually solvent, to then pay top dollar for them and give that to select groups.
[01:00:54.668 --> 01:00:57.650]  The Vice President of Goldman Sachs
[01:00:58.436 --> 01:01:06.221]  He is the one that's going to hand out the $700 billion, appointed by his former boss of Goldman Sachs, in complete conflict of interest, Henry Paulson.
[01:01:06.962 --> 01:01:09.364]  We've got Mike Rivera with us for the next hour.
[01:01:09.384 --> 01:01:10.304]  He joins us once a month.
[01:01:10.685 --> 01:01:12.746]  Also a great GCN radio talk show host.
[01:01:13.326 --> 01:01:15.928]  And of course, my website for those who are joining us.
[01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:19.211]  Websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:20.531]  We'll talk about the economy.
[01:01:23.459 --> 01:01:29.701]  CBC and others, as well as CBS, reporting that, oh, Delta Force is coming out and saying they weren't allowed to kill Bin Laden.
[01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:30.381]  That's old news.
[01:01:30.401 --> 01:01:37.823]  We'll get his take on that, where he sees the election going, and a lot more with Mike Rivero today.
[01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:38.883]  Mike, good to have you here with us.
[01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:43.964]  Well, thanks for having me on the show today, and boy, what an interesting time we are in right now, isn't it?
[01:01:44.444 --> 01:01:44.984]  Absolutely.
[01:01:45.024 --> 01:01:46.445]  Let's get into the economy first.
[01:01:46.465 --> 01:01:47.525]  Give us your breakdown on that.
[01:01:48.556 --> 01:01:57.398]  Well, obviously the economy has reached a crisis point and I think this really kind of shows the downside of this globalism idea.
[01:01:58.378 --> 01:02:18.625]  Uh, in that, you know, I have long maintained that national borders serve the same function for economies, and then for the Earth, that fireproof doors do for buildings and watertight bulkheads do for ships, and that is they contain an accident, and when you block open those fireproof doors, or you weld open the waterproof bulkheads to make it easier to move around,
[01:02:19.045 --> 01:02:24.506]  It all looks like it's better for a little while until you have an accident and then you can't keep things under control.
[01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:26.506]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:02:26.546 --> 01:02:31.047]  I have readers writing in and saying, why when the banks go down does it affect our market?
[01:02:31.127 --> 01:02:32.888]  Why when we go down does it affect them?
[01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:36.528]  Why is Europe in such trouble from all of the American problems?
[01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:41.909]  And the reason is the globalists took down the normal barricades that exist on national borders.
[01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:45.070]  We have European Union banks that were basically taking
[01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:46.471]  Continue breaking it down.
[01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:16.058]  Well, the idea is, I know that there are two schools of thought about what's going on right now.
[01:03:16.258 --> 01:03:32.214]  One is that the economic crash is intentionally planned to pave the way for the Amaro, and I have no doubt that those who are pushing for a North American Union and a single currency are planning on how they can exploit the current situation.
[01:03:33.074 --> 01:03:41.823]  And then there's the other school of thought, which is that it's simply accident, stupidity, and greed run rampant, and everybody looking out for themselves until the whole system breaks down.
[01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:54.414]  And, you know, a lot of current American economic thought goes back to this guy named Adam Smith, who created this theory that if everybody was just looking out for their own greed, they would somehow advance the system as a whole.
[01:03:55.055 --> 01:03:57.117]  And, of course, this theory was disproven.
[01:03:57.737 --> 01:04:02.221]  By John Nash, the mathematician.
[01:04:02.241 --> 01:04:09.148]  But even though he disproved it, people still like it because it sort of justifies that Gordon Gekko, greed is good mentality.
[01:04:09.488 --> 01:04:10.969]  What's good for me is good for the country.
[01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:19.177]  Obviously what we see here right now, though, is that everybody looking out just for themselves is ultimately very detrimental and destructive of the system as a whole.
[01:04:21.993 --> 01:04:31.282]  And the bottom line is that in our country, we stopped making products for money, and we turned money into the product.
[01:04:31.682 --> 01:04:44.274]  And Wall Street's major problem is that instead of just offering ordinary people a piece of investment in companies, they started playing all these little additional products and gambling games that got out of control.
[01:04:44.334 --> 01:04:46.276]  The derivatives are really what's doing the damage.
[01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.071]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:50.612]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[01:04:50.652 --> 01:04:53.594]  I want to get his take on how all this is going to unfold.
[01:04:54.014 --> 01:04:59.458]  The incredible insider trading and conflict of interest about who's running the banker takeover situation.
[01:05:02.518 --> 01:05:04.759]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[01:05:05.079 --> 01:05:08.260]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:13.762]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a whole week in advance?
[01:05:14.163 --> 01:05:16.564]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[01:05:16.924 --> 01:05:21.285]  The guys over at eminiforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:26.428]  They call it a G-Line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[01:05:26.868 --> 01:05:27.388]  Impossible?
[01:05:27.788 --> 01:05:32.550]  Head over to e-mini-forecaster.com and check out their forecast history to see for yourself.
[01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.912]  e-mini-forecaster.com predicts the market one whole week in advance.
[01:05:37.292 --> 01:05:40.874]  It's simple to use and can give you the market edge you've been looking for.
[01:05:41.234 --> 01:05:45.676]  If you're an active trader in the markets, go directly to e-mini-forecaster.com.
[01:05:45.936 --> 01:05:50.197]  That's e-m-i-n-i-forecaster.com right now for more information.
[01:05:50.438 --> 01:05:53.679]  Again, that's e-m-i-n-i-forecaster.com.
[01:05:55.606 --> 01:05:59.370]  This is Rob at EveningForecaster.com, and I approve this message.
[01:06:00.751 --> 01:06:07.137]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.519]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:06:10.139 --> 01:06:11.180]  But who is the enemy?
[01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:12.221]  Bin Laden.
[01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:13.422]  This is his MO.
[01:06:13.442 --> 01:06:14.824]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:06:14.844 --> 01:06:16.305]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:06:16.705 --> 01:06:23.572]  Enabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:06:23.992 --> 01:06:24.433]  Some U.S.
[01:06:24.473 --> 01:06:30.258]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:30.819 --> 01:06:34.282]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:34.502 --> 01:06:44.571]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:06:44.811 --> 01:06:45.552]  Fabled enemies.

[01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:13.119]  Here is why.
[01:07:13.659 --> 01:07:23.568]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[01:07:24.088 --> 01:07:26.470]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:28.912]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:07:28.952 --> 01:07:29.752]  this fall?
[01:07:29.932 --> 01:07:30.453]  Don't wait.

[01:08:09.404 --> 01:08:12.747]  Breaking down the economy with syndicated talk show host,
[01:08:13.826 --> 01:08:20.311]  Mike Rivera, by the way, Mike Rivera is in the new film, Fabled Enemies, put out by Jason Bermas, produced by myself.
[01:08:20.431 --> 01:08:21.131]  An excellent film.
[01:08:21.151 --> 01:08:24.554]  We'll talk some about that film with Mike before he leaves us.
[01:08:25.014 --> 01:08:37.223]  Now, in the shower, Mike, the reason I know this is contrived and engineered is that we had sources inside Bilderberg almost three years ago in the 2006 meeting
[01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:46.200]  And they said they were going to start a global implosion through the subprime mortgages and blame it on that, which we know is a fraction of the larger derivatives problem.
[01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:49.482]  Then, of course, before that, we have the IMF and World Bank documents.
[01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:55.665]  When Joseph Stiglitz left the World Bank with secret documents about how they get countries in debt by design and blow them out.
[01:08:55.746 --> 01:08:59.968]  They want the economy to fully collapse when confidence is lost so they can consolidate.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:08.921]  And we know that the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve, you know, they're only a small group of banks that control the regulators over the banks.
[01:09:09.762 --> 01:09:20.504]  And we know that we saw the last two weeks, the White House, the both party leaders in the House and the Senate, saying depression, depression, depression, knowing full well that would cause a depression.
[01:09:20.784 --> 01:09:28.045]  Then they got their banker takeover bill with immunity and the new powers and really about five trillion in funding, according to Bloomberg and other publications.
[01:09:28.928 --> 01:09:29.328]  We're good to go.
[01:09:47.837 --> 01:09:53.561]  Uh, having the 3rd Army working, ready to activate October 1st, signing PDD 51.
[01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:59.105]  Congressman last week, we had one of them on, told, if you don't pass this, martial law will be declared.
[01:09:59.526 --> 01:10:04.530]  But in the words of Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, uh, the banker bill gives them financial.
[01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.610]  Marshall Law.
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:07.351]  So they got it one way or another.
[01:10:07.391 --> 01:10:09.492]  I mean, these are amazing things that are happening.
[01:10:09.552 --> 01:10:17.154]  Whether they're doing it to try to maintain control, or whether they wanted to get us entrapped in debt, but it blew up in their face, and that does happen to bomb makers.
[01:10:17.695 --> 01:10:25.957]  Regardless, they are sitting atop it and proposing, as we said years ago they would, a world government run by the bankers with a carbon tax as the new bubble.
[01:10:26.018 --> 01:10:26.958]  That is on record.
[01:10:27.558 --> 01:10:30.519]  And now we've seen that proposed in all the major financial publications.
[01:10:30.879 --> 01:10:31.579]  That's a mouthful.
[01:10:31.619 --> 01:10:32.760]  Mike Rivera, your analysis.
[01:10:33.758 --> 01:10:42.660]  Well, my analysis is I have absolutely no doubt that there are always groups of people who are thinking about and planning for a global government of some form or other.
[01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:51.423]  But in this case, I think they may have stumbled rather badly, because while the spin certainly is that it's all those mean old subprime mortgage
[01:10:51.903 --> 01:10:54.684]  Holders who took out mortgages they couldn't afford and everything.
[01:10:54.984 --> 01:11:00.545]  The reality is most Americans understand full well that when these people took the mortgages out, they could afford them.
[01:11:00.885 --> 01:11:03.305]  They could afford the payments and it was all working out well.
[01:11:03.645 --> 01:11:11.847]  What put the screws to the American public is our government giving tax credits to corporations to make it easier to move jobs to other countries.
[01:11:12.307 --> 01:11:19.128]  And, you know, if this was a deliberate policy, you know, which is only one of two theories, it was either deliberate policy or incredibly stupid,
[01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:35.400]  But if it was deliberate policy, it's going to make it very hard to sell a global government and a global currency to the American people when they see the global interrelation of the various economies of the world is what's dragging it down, not moving it back up again.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:41.224]  The problem with this bailout package is this has destroyed all confidence in the U.S.
[01:11:41.284 --> 01:11:42.645]  government, all trust in the U.S.
[01:11:42.685 --> 01:11:44.327]  government, not that there was any left after Iraq,
[01:11:45.502 --> 01:12:02.769]  And so, they can sit up there and say, well, we propose a world government and global currency, but if the people of the world are saying, we've had it with globalism, we don't want it anymore, we want small, regional, little areas where we take care of ourselves, and you take care of yourselves, because the only reason to consolidate is to build empire.
[01:12:03.149 --> 01:12:07.691]  Mike, I mean, I agree with you, but what the people want is one thing, what happens is another.
[01:12:08.271 --> 01:12:09.672]  Ninety-plus percent
[01:12:10.623 --> 01:12:16.987]  Thousand-to-one phone calls, you know, into Congress against the banker bailout takeover, they still did it.
[01:12:17.107 --> 01:12:21.310]  So my point is, it is in the Wall Street Journal calling for a, quote, banking new world order.
[01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.251]  It is in the Financial Times of London.
[01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:24.331]  It is in the BBC.
[01:12:24.752 --> 01:12:33.577]  Kissinger and Soros and all of them are calling for this, and it's what they said they would do back in the seventies in the Trilateral Commission documents, and they're not stupid.
[01:12:33.897 --> 01:12:40.241]  They know bailing out the institutions that engineered this and buying securities and derivatives at a hundred percent
[01:12:41.408 --> 01:12:48.053]  Whatever value they say it is, when they're really next to worthless, and in some cases are worthless, they know that's going to destroy Main Street.
[01:12:48.353 --> 01:12:50.694]  They know that's going to accelerate the destruction of the dollar.
[01:12:51.075 --> 01:13:00.281]  So, they are carrying out a path that will crater the economy to an extent that things will break down, there will be riots, and the people will welcome the military.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.921]  Well, that may be the plan.
[01:13:04.041 --> 01:13:11.706]  I don't think it's going to work out, because the American people, the people of the world, are very different than they were back in the 1970s.
[01:13:11.746 --> 01:13:22.432]  1970s, you know, the Internet was just beginning as the ARPANET, and most Americans still trusted what they got from the media and what they were getting from, you know, newspapers and the rest of it.
[01:13:22.872 --> 01:13:26.074]  And, you know, the rules that worked back then, the Cold War
[01:13:26.374 --> 01:13:27.614]  I totally agree with you on that.
[01:13:27.634 --> 01:13:29.715]  We're just looking at this from a different...
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.022]  Slightly different perspectives and angles, and that's why we have you here.
[01:13:49.142 --> 01:14:00.550]  So, extrapolating forward, in the 70s they could fool 60-70% into believing the government loved them and wanted to help them and was benevolent and wanted to, you know, give them kisses on the forehead and was sweet and loving.
[01:14:01.071 --> 01:14:11.498]  Now you get 90-plus percent against open borders, 90-plus percent, or 80-plus percent against the war, 99-percent literally against the banker takeover bill.
[01:14:12.253 --> 01:14:13.134]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:14:13.494 --> 01:14:16.997]  They are playing a 30, 40, 50 year old game where they have media dominance.
[01:14:17.297 --> 01:14:24.684]  Even if they shut the web down today, the genies out of the bottle, they are totally discredited in every poll and every number, 9% approval ratings for Congress.
[01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:25.824]  I agree with you.
[01:14:26.145 --> 01:14:30.128]  I'm saying they think they're in control, they're going ahead with this, and it's not going to work.
[01:14:30.168 --> 01:14:33.811]  So it's like two freight trains going 80 miles an hour, running into each other.
[01:14:33.851 --> 01:14:34.712]  What's going to happen here?
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.682]  Well, obviously we're heading toward a crisis.
[01:14:37.742 --> 01:14:42.427]  I'm afraid, you know, we are dealing with a government that is more than willing to use violence to achieve its ends.
[01:14:42.467 --> 01:14:47.192]  We've seen that in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and even Pakistan, where the U.S.
[01:14:47.212 --> 01:14:51.516]  government is perfectly willing to kill 20 innocent people to get one suspected militant.
[01:14:51.857 --> 01:14:54.960]  I think we'll see the same policy enacted here in the United States.
[01:14:55.300 --> 01:15:01.242]  We've already seen they're building these giant open-air microwave oven pain machines on the top of armored vehicles.
[01:15:01.643 --> 01:15:05.144]  Those are there to herd us where the government wants us to be herded.
[01:15:05.444 --> 01:15:10.686]  So the bottom line is we're coming up on a period of violence directed at the American people by the U.S.
[01:15:10.726 --> 01:15:13.207]  government to get us to go along with their plans.
[01:15:13.587 --> 01:15:16.969]  But you know, anytime somebody has tried that in history,
[01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:20.191]  You know, it has not worked out very well.
[01:15:20.211 --> 01:15:22.752]  Hitler's 1,000-year Reich lasted only 12 years.
[01:15:23.072 --> 01:15:27.095]  The new American century looks to be collapsing after just 6 or 8.
[01:15:27.935 --> 01:15:32.758]  And, you know, it looks to me like... I think it's going to fall apart.
[01:15:33.178 --> 01:15:38.385]  And I think we're seeing probably the 21st century equivalent of the fall of the Roman Empire.
[01:15:38.725 --> 01:15:44.652]  Well Mike, I agree with you, but I mean, for new listeners, you're not just saying microwave guns and sound cannons.
[01:15:44.672 --> 01:15:49.899]  The Army came out in their official publication two weeks ago and said, we're preparing
[01:15:50.379 --> 01:16:10.539]  For war with the American people, civil unrest, non-lethal weapons, what the head of the Air Force said two years ago, use them first on the Americans, then we can claim they're allowable in war, they're illegal under international conventions, you know, we're the guinea pigs, and we have them hiring felons for the military, illegal aliens, I mean, they're gonna make a go at it, and I agree!
[01:16:11.159 --> 01:16:18.167]  If 1% of the public who has guns fights back, and it'll be more than that, if they try this, those guys with microwave guns are going to get blasted.
[01:16:18.627 --> 01:16:27.577]  And, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not bashing Iraqis, but, you know, the types of Americans that are going to be fighting, and it's going to happen, if this keeps going on, are the former military people.
[01:16:27.637 --> 01:16:28.958]  I mean, I feel sorry for the military.
[01:16:29.158 --> 01:16:30.420]  They are going to get shot to hell.
[01:16:31.736 --> 01:16:41.761]  Well, they really are, and again, because the United States is a more technological society than Iraq is, we're going to find better ways to defeat these devices.
[01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:48.824]  I mean, there are already some very good theoretical foundations for making those microwave vehicles self-destruct.
[01:16:49.464 --> 01:16:53.006]  And I'm not going to go into that on the air, but, you know, it's being talked about.
[01:16:53.466 --> 01:16:59.749]  And as far as trying to control the Internet and the alternative media, you're probably aware the government ordered the shutdown of Usenet last June.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.841]  Explain to people who don't know what that means.
[01:17:04.481 --> 01:17:20.406]  Okay, before there was the World Wide Web and browsers like Netscape and Firefox, people shared information on a mass basis through a news group system called Usenet that goes back to the early days of the Internet, even before it was the Internet, when it was still the ARPANET.
[01:17:20.466 --> 01:17:24.687]  The whole VBS system, and people have said, well, they shut down the free web as they're announcing.
[01:17:24.987 --> 01:17:27.108]  Web 1 will go back to the Usenet.
[01:17:27.508 --> 01:17:27.888]  Uh-uh.
[01:17:29.517 --> 01:17:30.437]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:30.737 --> 01:17:32.258]  In June, the U.S.
[01:17:32.318 --> 01:17:38.359]  government, claiming that it was a haven for child pornography, shut down Usenet.
[01:17:38.639 --> 01:17:45.300]  Now, it's still available in other countries, and people who were using Usenet are simply attaching to servers, you know, in other lands.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.421]  But inside the United States, it's been shut down.
[01:17:47.681 --> 01:17:53.242]  The real motive appears to be that, you know, the government wanted truly anonymous mass communication ended on the Internet.
[01:17:53.662 --> 01:18:02.065]  And, of course, there was a lot of pressure from the motion picture and recording industries to shut down Usenet because a lot of material was being posted there that was copyrighted.
[01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:12.869]  But, again, they found this child porn supposedly planted in about 80 different news groups out of some 90,000 that were in existence.
[01:18:13.469 --> 01:18:15.250]  That's how it works.
[01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:20.912]  That's like saying there's one bad person in Detroit, Michigan, so we'll just make everybody leave Detroit, Michigan.
[01:18:21.886 --> 01:18:24.709]  Well, again, that's what we're seeing in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:18:24.729 --> 01:18:25.010]  The U.S.
[01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:31.938]  government gladly kills 20 innocent civilians to get one suspected militant, even if they can't actually prove the militant was guilty of anything.
[01:18:32.178 --> 01:18:35.262]  That's the mentality and mindset we're seeing in the American people right now.
[01:18:35.702 --> 01:18:40.468]  But they are trying to figure out ways that they can shut down the non-commercial portions of the Internet.
[01:18:41.428 --> 01:18:46.412]  They're trying to figure out ways that they can limit people's ability to communicate anonymously.
[01:18:46.752 --> 01:18:52.036]  They want a system where if you're writing from point A to point B, they can track it, read it, and use it.
[01:18:52.316 --> 01:19:03.583]  But the bottom line is that all of this stuff allows them to watch ordinary Americans, but people who are really intent on secret communications, there are very easy ways to do this.
[01:19:04.144 --> 01:19:10.548]  Many years ago... The whole attack is built around shutting down the general public's free speech and sharing information.
[01:19:11.334 --> 01:19:16.459]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is, so that we have to go back to being dependent on the commercial media.
[01:19:16.479 --> 01:19:17.120]  But you know something?
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:25.509]  It's not going to work, because remember, in the old former Soviet Union, they didn't have an internet, but they had fax machines, and this network of fax machines.
[01:19:25.549 --> 01:19:32.837]  Well, it's going to cost me about $2,000 a month, but we hope to get a sponsor, but we're putting in hundreds of regular landlines.
[01:19:33.697 --> 01:19:34.398]  Uh, next week.
[01:19:34.418 --> 01:19:35.478]  They're already going in this week.
[01:19:35.819 --> 01:19:41.282]  So people can dial into those, record the show that way, and then distribute it out.
[01:19:41.802 --> 01:19:44.164]  Uh, so we're already preparing for the web to be shut down here.
[01:19:44.584 --> 01:19:46.485]  We're already gearing up for it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:46.505 --> 01:19:47.466]  This is not a joke.
[01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:48.647]  This is not a game.
[01:19:48.687 --> 01:19:50.588]  There's a multi-pronged public attack.
[01:19:50.608 --> 01:19:55.831]  Uh, we now have Senator Lieberman basically running YouTube, ordering whatever he wants removed.
[01:19:56.351 --> 01:19:57.392]  Mike Rivera is our guest.

[01:20:05.044 --> 01:20:06.486]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:20:06.826 --> 01:20:07.526]  Sound familiar?
[01:20:07.666 --> 01:20:10.989]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?

[01:21:16.476 --> 01:21:16.636]  I think?
[01:21:34.011 --> 01:21:37.253]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:50.159]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:22:54.306 --> 01:23:01.752]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:23:01.932 --> 01:23:03.373]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:23:03.673 --> 01:23:05.915]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:23:06.355 --> 01:23:11.099]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:23:11.499 --> 01:23:14.341]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[01:24:09.063 --> 01:24:12.906]  Mike Rivero had one of the very first big websites on the internet.
[01:24:12.946 --> 01:24:18.189]  He was really the guy that brought out most of the first information that was picked up by others about the murder of Vince Foster.
[01:24:19.811 --> 01:24:23.353]  And he works in the film industry, works a lot of IT stuff.
[01:24:23.373 --> 01:24:24.414]  He knows of what he speaks.
[01:24:26.535 --> 01:24:33.520]  Remember three months ago, Senator Lieberman wrote letters to Google, which also owns YouTube, and said basically anything criticizing the government
[01:24:34.387 --> 01:24:36.249]  Is helping Al-Qaeda needs to be banned.
[01:24:36.269 --> 01:24:45.499]  They had simultaneous hearings showing Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, which is getting peer-reviewed journals to document bombs in the buildings.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.201]  They're very threatened by that.
[01:24:47.221 --> 01:24:51.085]  They put that in-between video of Al-Qaeda training videos saying this is Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:52.026 --> 01:24:55.710]  And now YouTube is banning basically whatever the government wants banned.
[01:24:56.457 --> 01:25:03.240]  I mean, they'll even ban a beauty pageant that has, you know, 30 seconds of Sarah Palin in it from the 80s.
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:04.640]  Just whatever they want.
[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:11.583]  When ABC News is airing them killing the puppy, throwing it off the cliff of the Marines, well, we have YouTube banning it.
[01:25:11.643 --> 01:25:12.383]  They will still ban it.
[01:25:12.923 --> 01:25:16.985]  They will ban video of the troops shooting Iraqis, driving down the road in cars and laughing.
[01:25:18.944 --> 01:25:21.128]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it's already happening.
[01:25:21.148 --> 01:25:21.929]  That's only one way.
[01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:25.255]  So what are some of the other ways they plan to shut down free speech if we break down?
[01:25:25.535 --> 01:25:27.098]  What's going to happen in the future, Mike Rivera?
[01:25:28.287 --> 01:25:35.389]  Well, one of the more obvious ways that they've been doing it is they're basically trying to buy up all the key sites we've seen.
[01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:48.213]  Google and Yahoo basically, even though Google is in serious financial trouble itself, it's still out there acquiring other websites, acquiring other properties to bring under its gigantic media umbrella.
[01:25:48.273 --> 01:25:56.196]  And we're basically seeing the creation of internet megacorporations to rival the media corporations and the traditional
[01:25:57.176 --> 01:25:59.877]  Yeah, and I think that's gonna be the next step.
[01:26:17.504 --> 01:26:17.964]  We're good to go.
[01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:51.742]  University carriers for orgs and 54 comms which will be private companies and then you sign a sub-licensing with them and then they license you under a contract you sign and then they can ban you like YouTube or MySpace.
[01:26:52.903 --> 01:26:54.224]  Yeah, basically that's it.
[01:26:54.264 --> 01:27:00.870]  They're trying to basically take the public internet and, you know, re-corporatize it and put it under control.
[01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:04.233]  But again, the wires that are out there
[01:27:06.532 --> 01:27:07.973]  People are going to find ways around it.
[01:27:07.993 --> 01:27:13.697]  They've been trying to ban the internet in China, and the IT guys there are just finding ways around it.
[01:27:14.417 --> 01:27:20.301]  And it's a case of, you know, once the people know that there is truth out there to find, they're going to want to go find it.
[01:27:20.601 --> 01:27:22.442]  That's just almost an instinct with people.
[01:27:22.542 --> 01:27:28.566]  And again, going back to the fall of the Soviet Union, I mean, look at all the controls they had in that country.
[01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:34.029]  When you bought a typewriter, you had to type out a sample piece of paper and turn it over to the police.
[01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:39.775]  So that if they ever found a typewritten document they didn't agree with, they could match which typewriter it came from.
[01:27:40.236 --> 01:27:48.665]  And we're already seeing that here in the United States where color laser jets put hidden codes on the paper they print, so the police can find out who sent, you know,
[01:27:49.426 --> 01:27:54.830]  By the way, the Patriot movement in the 80s and 90s grew before the internet with the fax brigades, as they were called here.
[01:28:17.605 --> 01:28:22.226]  And also with Fidonet, which was a modem-to-modem packet transmission utility.
[01:28:22.946 --> 01:28:35.009]  That's in the middle of a revival right now, where people are digging their modems out of their garages and they're going back to using the phone lines to connect their computers together so they can operate outside the broadband cable net.
[01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:37.389]  And that's why the Feds just shut down that old system.
[01:28:38.729 --> 01:28:41.870]  They can still do it over the web, but they shut down the old operating system.
[01:28:42.412 --> 01:28:51.760]  They shut down the Usenet, but people can set it back up again using Fidonet because Fidonet operates completely separate from the broadband internet.
[01:28:53.866 --> 01:29:03.734]  Well, bottom line, people had better appreciate InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, WhatReallyHappened.com now, while it's still got about 98% freedom.
[01:29:03.754 --> 01:29:06.016]  But we can see the screws being put in.
[01:29:06.377 --> 01:29:12.742]  Also, with Comcast and Time Warner announcing, oh, we're only going to let you visit a few thousand sites, we're not going to give you access to the other sites.
[01:29:12.762 --> 01:29:15.204]  That's already begun in Canada and Texas and other places.
[01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:25.749]  Yeah, that's definitely, the problem is when you sign up for one of these really big internet service providers, you have to use their gateways and they can control what you see.
[01:29:25.929 --> 01:29:37.974]  Here's an example, just four months ago, I have several systems, but we have Time Warner cable, cable modem, and now if I type a URL in wrong, it doesn't give me a screen on my computer, I'm on the Time Warner website.
[01:29:38.735 --> 01:29:40.036]  So see, you're going through their gate.
[01:29:40.056 --> 01:29:42.297]  They're logging everything, tracking everything.
[01:29:42.717 --> 01:29:43.397]  That is the model.
[01:29:43.457 --> 01:29:48.099]  Mike, we're gonna come back, talk more about how things, how you see things unfolding on the other side.
[01:29:48.119 --> 01:29:49.940]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.101]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.581 --> 01:29:54.181]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.102 --> 01:29:57.803]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.821 --> 01:30:05.724]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[01:30:06.184 --> 01:30:08.225]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:30:08.706 --> 01:30:14.029]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.
[01:30:14.389 --> 01:30:17.552]  GasFreedom is an affordable, practical, free energy device.
[01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:23.015]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:30:23.596 --> 01:30:28.199]  HHO, also called browns gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[01:30:28.639 --> 01:30:31.561]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[01:30:31.961 --> 01:30:34.142]  This is the secret the oil companies don't want you to know.

[01:30:52.771 --> 01:30:53.231]  Call today.
[01:31:01.227 --> 01:31:07.652]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:07.992 --> 01:31:09.953]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:10.634 --> 01:31:11.694]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:12.195 --> 01:31:12.755]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:12.975 --> 01:31:13.916]  This is his MO.
[01:31:13.936 --> 01:31:15.337]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:15.357 --> 01:31:17.038]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:17.358 --> 01:31:24.083]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:24.483 --> 01:31:24.923]  Some U.S.
[01:31:24.963 --> 01:31:30.765]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:31.325 --> 01:31:34.805]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:31:34.825 --> 01:31:45.068]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:31:45.288 --> 01:31:46.048]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:31:46.528 --> 01:31:53.130]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:57.733]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:01.256 --> 01:32:06.920]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[01:32:07.201 --> 01:32:11.985]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[01:32:12.245 --> 01:32:17.209]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[01:32:17.409 --> 01:32:20.792]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[01:32:21.332 --> 01:32:29.496]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[01:32:29.837 --> 01:32:34.799]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:41.383]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[01:32:41.623 --> 01:32:43.944]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[01:32:44.224 --> 01:32:46.647]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[01:33:46.679 --> 01:33:46.839]  Go!
[01:33:50.327 --> 01:33:52.489]  Mike Rivero is our guest.
[01:33:52.709 --> 01:34:05.238]  Mike, looking forward to more of what we're going to see in the near future, mid-term and long-term.
[01:34:06.499 --> 01:34:14.845]  Regardless of what's orchestrating the financial collapse, the immunity, the power, the takeover, the establishment knows it's not going to help Main Street.
[01:34:14.905 --> 01:34:19.228]  It's going to hurt it with the devaluation of the currency, bare minimum.
[01:34:20.026 --> 01:34:22.227]  And everything is falling apart financially.
[01:34:22.728 --> 01:34:24.128]  The jobless claims are spiking.
[01:34:24.729 --> 01:34:30.972]  And we had 90% or close to 90% living on farms during the Great Depression being self-sufficient.
[01:34:31.752 --> 01:34:36.135]  And still 7 million starved to death according to university studies over the decade-long depression.
[01:34:36.635 --> 01:34:39.537]  Because the bankers would kick folks off their lands they couldn't produce in some cases.
[01:34:40.457 --> 01:34:42.518]  Now we have 90% living in the cities.
[01:34:43.219 --> 01:34:46.781]  Of the 10% living in rural areas, only about half are still self-sufficient.
[01:34:46.801 --> 01:34:47.101]  The rest
[01:34:47.725 --> 01:34:54.111]  Work at gas stations, or power plants, or prisons, or at the local office supply store.
[01:34:56.593 --> 01:35:00.576]  I mean, we've got world leaders talking about abyss, total breakdown, everything stopping.
[01:35:02.078 --> 01:35:04.400]  Trying to terrorize us into going along with this?
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:06.642]  Or is that really a big threat?
[01:35:06.982 --> 01:35:10.145]  And why are they activating the 3rd Brigade and the rest of it?
[01:35:11.778 --> 01:35:16.823]  Well, I think obviously, you know, the government's first instinct is its own self-preservation and survival.
[01:35:17.043 --> 01:35:22.308]  And we know that FEMA does not really exist to take care of the people in the event of an emergency.
[01:35:22.688 --> 01:35:29.334]  FEMA's primary charter is to preserve the government, even against the people, during times of a national emergency.
[01:35:29.354 --> 01:35:35.380]  And that's what its real function is and what most of its budget and staff are focused on, is continuity of government.
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.283]  And, you know, keeping the system moving forward.
[01:35:38.623 --> 01:35:39.384]  I think the U.S.
[01:35:39.444 --> 01:35:42.967]  government is well aware they've pushed the population to the edge of a rebellion.
[01:35:43.207 --> 01:35:48.633]  That's the reason they've got the troops back here from Iraq, you know, in the streets of America in defiance of Posse Comitatus.
[01:35:49.053 --> 01:35:50.875]  We already know the government is acting illegally.
[01:35:50.915 --> 01:35:54.919]  This bailout bill, the manner in which it was passed, was completely unconstitutional.
[01:35:55.519 --> 01:35:59.300]  So, we know the government is not even following the law itself.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:05.982]  It's just doing whatever it takes to have another week, you know, in power in Sodom on the Potomac.
[01:36:06.862 --> 01:36:10.904]  We know we've had massive election fraud for the last several elections.
[01:36:10.944 --> 01:36:12.784]  We're seeing it again this time.
[01:36:13.204 --> 01:36:15.645]  It's just the people in power want to stay there.
[01:36:15.705 --> 01:36:18.446]  They don't want to give up the goodies and the perks and the privilege.
[01:36:19.166 --> 01:36:33.236]  And people who get to that level generally are perfectly willing to do anything to hang on to power, including killing off, you know, thousands of other Americans in a new false flag terror attack to try and scare us back into submission.
[01:36:33.676 --> 01:36:48.566]  But, you know, the problem with using fear to control a population is once the fear wears off, and fear is very tiring, it's very exhausting, once you get too tired to be afraid anymore and you start thinking again, you see what your government's been up to, that's when it really starts to fall apart.
[01:36:49.366 --> 01:36:58.312]  And the problem right now is, you know, Bush can get up there and say, well, this bailout was really necessary and trust me, and nobody's trusting him because we know we were lied to about Iraq.
[01:36:58.593 --> 01:37:00.654]  We've reached the point where the U.S.
[01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:08.879]  government really cannot effectively govern anymore because of the skepticism and mistrust and loss of faith by the American people.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:15.804]  And a government that can't govern during a time of crisis is a government that is eventually doomed to collapse.
[01:37:16.318 --> 01:37:17.579]  Now, you know my view.
[01:37:17.639 --> 01:37:20.221]  Both candidates are bought and paid for by the same interests.
[01:37:20.241 --> 01:37:21.061]  You know, that's proven.
[01:37:21.222 --> 01:37:28.807]  Why does Barack Obama, who I know you're leaning towards thinking it's a new regime, why is he getting triple the Wall Street money that McCain is?
[01:37:29.007 --> 01:37:33.210]  And it really is true they're threatening people with arrest if they, quote, lie about him.
[01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:33.931]  That was true.
[01:37:33.971 --> 01:37:37.853]  They just arrested, detained Corsi over in Kenya.
[01:37:37.873 --> 01:37:41.436]  I mean, I agree with Webster Tarpoli in that
[01:37:42.538 --> 01:37:44.340]  That with McCain, you've got a dead duck.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.321]  No one supports him.
[01:37:45.341 --> 01:37:46.342]  They know he's a criminal.
[01:37:47.183 --> 01:37:49.626]  He doesn't have any of that pizzazz or star power.
[01:37:50.146 --> 01:37:53.010]  But with Barack Obama, they get a new fresh face to
[01:37:55.243 --> 01:37:56.464]  Expand their operation.
[01:37:56.484 --> 01:37:58.145]  And I've looked into it.
[01:37:58.185 --> 01:38:01.387]  I mean, Barack Obama really is the biggest gun grabber on paper.
[01:38:01.847 --> 01:38:09.292]  I mean, he says, ban all your .308s and .223 rifles, which is most of them, calling them, you know, some type of devil weapon.
[01:38:09.832 --> 01:38:10.733]  And I'm not weighing in.
[01:38:10.773 --> 01:38:12.954]  I'm not going to... I can't even vote in Travis County.
[01:38:13.234 --> 01:38:15.636]  We know we have total election fraud here for over a decade.
[01:38:16.116 --> 01:38:16.836]  That's been proven.
[01:38:17.297 --> 01:38:18.498]  Some people say, well, who are you going to vote for?
[01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:19.618]  Well, I'm not allowed to vote here.
[01:38:19.958 --> 01:38:20.379]  It's fake.
[01:38:20.439 --> 01:38:20.919]  We've proven it.
[01:38:20.939 --> 01:38:22.240]  It's even come out in the paper.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:37.515]  And the Legislative Election Commission said, well yeah, Travis County is allowed to double count ballot boxes, falsify signatures, break safety seals.
[01:38:37.535 --> 01:38:42.340]  I understand that if I weigh in on either side, that only empowers the left-right paradigm, but your take on that?
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:46.662]  Well, you know, Obama is far from being a perfect candidate.
[01:38:46.682 --> 01:38:47.882]  I mean, I wanted Ron Paul.
[01:38:47.922 --> 01:38:49.043]  A lot of other people did.
[01:38:49.243 --> 01:38:55.546]  And I think it's time that, you know, we change the system to allow a level playing field for third parties.
[01:38:55.586 --> 01:39:02.049]  Because right now, the way it's set up, the two quote-unquote traditional parties have all the advantages going into every election.
[01:39:02.749 --> 01:39:12.893]  And it really is, it's not quite a locked door to a third party, but they definitely make you go through several more hallways to try and run a campaign than the traditional parties do.
[01:39:15.694 --> 01:39:25.758]  The only reason I'm leaning toward Obama is because I don't want McCain, and I think McCain shot himself in the foot by picking Sarah Palin in a moment of peak when he couldn't get Joe Lieberman.
[01:39:26.259 --> 01:39:32.021]  And I think the reason that everybody is donating to Barack Obama right now is they want to be in good with the guy they think is going to win.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:39.254]  And, you know, that's really what it's coming down to, is the more it looks like you're going to win, the more money you're going to attract.
[01:39:40.164 --> 01:39:47.966]  And that's why that early campaign really is important, because that perception is what drives the funding for the latter part of the campaign.
[01:39:48.526 --> 01:40:02.290]  And I know there's a lot of vested interest still pushing for McCain to win, because he's going to continue the policies of the Bush administration that have allowed the rich to get richer and the military to get, you know, literally historic levels of funding.
[01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:06.231]  And I should add, and I continue, but I want your take on this before I forget,
[01:40:07.296 --> 01:40:13.861]  Just because Barack Obama in most polls is nine points ahead, and the Electoral College, they are in a dead heat.
[01:40:16.723 --> 01:40:22.567]  I think the numbers have shifted slightly toward Obama as of the last time they did an Electoral College.
[01:40:22.607 --> 01:40:26.510]  He's only got one more point, yeah.
[01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:33.995]  Okay, but I think the trend is definitely there, and the problem is that Sarah Palin really was the worst choice
[01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:52.373]  That McCain could have made for Vice President, and I know his stated logic was he wanted a female Vice Presidential candidate to lure the disaffected Hillary voters, but to pick up, you know, this ex-beauty queen, you know, who's opposed to abortion and wants the end of the world to come around, I think was a mistake.
[01:40:53.654 --> 01:41:00.456]  Now, I talked to our own Hawaii State Governor, Linda Lingle, and McCain's people did not even call her.
[01:41:01.156 --> 01:41:14.480]  And now I don't agree with everything that Linda Lingle says, and she doesn't look all that hot in a bathing suit, and I'm sorry Linda, but you don't, but she at least knows the mechanism of government, and she would have been a far more credible vice presidential nomination than Sarah Palin.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:20.022]  So I think probably future history is going to look back at Sarah Palin as the reason McCain really lost it.
[01:41:22.111 --> 01:41:24.693]  Well, I mean, Mike, you're a smart guy.
[01:41:24.733 --> 01:41:26.655]  You know they're just fronts and puppets.
[01:41:26.675 --> 01:41:30.258]  I mean, we've got Northcom saying it basically runs everything.
[01:41:30.298 --> 01:41:34.541]  You've got Congress being told, if you don't pass this, we'll declare martial law.
[01:41:35.002 --> 01:41:37.604]  And the committee chairmen are all either on board or blackmailed.
[01:41:38.024 --> 01:41:44.930]  They're getting ready to set Barney Frank, the pervert, up for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, for hiring his boyfriend to head one of them up.
[01:41:46.111 --> 01:41:46.551]  So it's just...
[01:41:48.607 --> 01:41:48.947]  I don't know.
[01:41:49.027 --> 01:41:54.509]  It's all incredible corruption there, and I hope that when the U.S.
[01:41:54.529 --> 01:41:58.491]  government collapses, and I really do believe that it's going to collapse the way the U.S.S.R.
[01:41:58.531 --> 01:42:17.319]  did, and we start to think about forming a new country, that we just sort of go back to that constitutional system that worked for us for the first hundred years, and why we ever let ourselves get tricked away from that, you know, where the Treasury controlled the money and we had currency of a fixed value, and all these things that worked for the common people.
[01:42:17.839 --> 01:42:23.762]  And then starting in 1913, we just got swindled by the bankers one time after the other, after the other, after the other.
[01:42:24.422 --> 01:42:30.265]  And we're in the mess we're in right now because we gave away our national sovereignty to private banks.
[01:42:30.525 --> 01:42:33.386]  And that is really the root of all of our problems.
[01:42:35.247 --> 01:42:41.930]  But specifically, as the economy breaks down, as confidence in the government falls apart,
[01:42:43.083 --> 01:42:45.827]  It doesn't matter to the establishment or the people who are against it.
[01:42:45.927 --> 01:42:49.552]  They are just going to use their expanded police force to try to suppress the people.
[01:42:50.013 --> 01:42:57.764]  But what are the police going to do when their grandmas are homeless, and their cousins are homeless, and their dollar is being devalued?
[01:43:00.002 --> 01:43:01.923]  I think we're going to see a societal breakdown.
[01:43:01.943 --> 01:43:09.286]  The bottom line is that the police state mentality, they don't really have enough people to control the United States.
[01:43:09.326 --> 01:43:18.309]  I mean, look how much trouble they're having in Iraq and Afghanistan, where they're out there with tanks and guns and helicopters and warplanes and bombs, and they still can't keep the places under control.
[01:43:18.569 --> 01:43:20.030]  This is the United States of America.
[01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:21.410]  We've got 300 million people.
[01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:23.371]  We are technologically trained.
[01:43:23.711 --> 01:43:25.712]  Many of us are ex-soldiers and we're trained.
[01:43:26.332 --> 01:43:27.332]  If the U.S.
[01:43:27.372 --> 01:43:32.294]  military can't control the streets of Iraq, they certainly cannot control the streets of the United States of America.
[01:43:35.434 --> 01:43:41.276]  Well, Mike, I just can't believe it's all unfolding, just like we said it would.
[01:43:41.296 --> 01:43:47.117]  A, do you think, how long will this recession last?
[01:43:47.177 --> 01:43:49.038]  When will it officially be called a depression?
[01:43:51.821 --> 01:43:58.872]  Well, the definition of a depression is a rather arbitrary one where they say... Three quarters without growth.
[01:43:59.593 --> 01:44:02.998]  Yeah, well, three quarters without growth, 25% unemployment.
[01:44:03.379 --> 01:44:04.000]  The problem is...
[01:44:05.894 --> 01:44:10.376]  We have to rely on the government to get those numbers, and we know the government lies.
[01:44:10.476 --> 01:44:12.357]  We could be in a depression right now.
[01:44:12.558 --> 01:44:20.082]  We already know that the unemployment numbers are subject to reinterpretation and recalculation.
[01:44:20.502 --> 01:44:30.707]  They have these different categories that people who have been out of work over a certain period of time get shuffled off into these specialized categories, so they're not counted in the immediate unemployment figures.
[01:44:30.847 --> 01:44:31.808]  Yeah, they're called books.
[01:44:32.569 --> 01:44:34.650]  Yeah, they cook the books is the short version.
[01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:38.372]  That's the problem when you live under a government that you know lies to you.
[01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:43.414]  You have no way of knowing what the real situation is, and obviously the government is going to lie to put it to the test.
[01:44:43.434 --> 01:44:44.935]  And they're lying to themselves, too.
[01:44:45.755 --> 01:44:46.976]  They're lying to themselves, too.
[01:44:48.036 --> 01:44:50.818]  Yeah, there's a lot of gross self-deception going on there.
[01:44:50.858 --> 01:44:55.820]  I mean, they even cooked the Dow Industrial Averages, you know, when it was really bad a couple of weeks ago.
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:58.922]  They said, well, we'll just take out AIG because it's such a downer.
[01:44:58.942 --> 01:44:59.882]  Well, they always do that.
[01:44:59.902 --> 01:45:01.503]  They're always taking losers out of the 30.
[01:45:02.538 --> 01:45:05.861]  Yeah, and put Kraft Foods in, which is always going to be a winner.
[01:45:05.941 --> 01:45:12.186]  It's still down 270 today, as a matter of fact, as we watch this thing.
[01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:20.293]  But the bottom line is, we can't trust anything that we're getting from the media or from the government.
[01:45:20.574 --> 01:45:25.198]  And of course, that's why they hate shows like yours and mine and the Internet, is because they know Americans.
[01:45:25.858 --> 01:45:32.361]  Want to know what's really going on and that's why the the viewership of the mainstream media is in decline Your audience is going up.
[01:45:32.481 --> 01:45:41.825]  My audience is going up your blog your your website readership is exploding My website readership is exploding people know they've been lied to they're angry about it
[01:45:42.505 --> 01:45:55.631]  And, you know, they're coming to the alternative media, and it's for that reason that any efforts by the government to curtail the alternative media are going to be too obvious to everybody, and that's just going to further fan the anger that's out there.
[01:45:56.012 --> 01:46:11.279]  Well, Mike, when you talk about exploding, when I get up on air and I talk about how almost any guest we call, even outside the liberty, freedom, reality genre, even mainline guests, almost all of them have heard of the show, and many of them like the show.
[01:46:11.954 --> 01:46:15.282]  We can randomly call up companies we want to sponsor.
[01:46:15.964 --> 01:46:20.696]  And I'm talking 80% of the time they know who we are with the first person that answers the phone.
[01:46:21.784 --> 01:46:23.385]  And the majority of the time, they're a fan.
[01:46:23.425 --> 01:46:26.186]  A small part of the time, they hate us or are scared of us.
[01:46:26.967 --> 01:46:30.008]  And you know, we called Chuck Norris up to have him on, and he's been listening for years.
[01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:36.112]  You know, comes on the show and says that, I mean, on the street and other parts of the country, other parts of the world.
[01:46:36.152 --> 01:46:36.632]  And you're right.
[01:46:37.032 --> 01:46:38.013]  Your numbers are exploding.
[01:46:38.053 --> 01:46:38.593]  I look at them.
[01:46:38.693 --> 01:46:39.593]  Our numbers are exploding.
[01:46:39.734 --> 01:46:43.075]  All the web rating services, I mean, doubling in the last three months.
[01:46:43.175 --> 01:46:44.316]  And it's exponential.
[01:46:44.816 --> 01:46:49.979]  I don't see how the establishment can't bring in martial law or shut down the web because just looking
[01:46:51.983 --> 01:46:52.803]  At my growth numbers.
[01:46:52.843 --> 01:46:59.408]  Now the problem is the alternative media is infiltrated by a lot of disinformation people.
[01:46:59.488 --> 01:47:10.496]  It's infiltrated by tell-and-tell pro specialists who know how to get people in fighting with each other and then almost even countering it feeds into but we need to point it out any site that spends you know even a third of its time
[01:47:11.196 --> 01:47:11.777]  I don't know.
[01:47:28.234 --> 01:47:33.455]  And then they'll say, I don't understand why they don't work with us after they've spewed all these lies and propaganda.
[01:47:33.695 --> 01:47:35.015]  Of course, they're being deceptive.
[01:47:36.236 --> 01:47:37.976]  They know they're trying to deceive their audiences.
[01:47:38.016 --> 01:47:40.477]  Now, a small group of them are government operatives.
[01:47:40.797 --> 01:47:42.997]  And then the mockingbirds kind of hear it and parrot it.
[01:47:43.257 --> 01:47:49.138]  But it's kind of a social morbidity, a very morbid, very nasty mode.
[01:47:49.158 --> 01:47:51.219]  And I don't see it holding us back.
[01:47:51.319 --> 01:47:55.520]  I mean, we've really reached terminal velocities, as they say, where we're escaping out of this.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:10.251]  I see the enemy throwing in every trick they've got, throwing in, you know, just every form of propellant they've got to try to get us to, you know, to tell us 9-11 truth is dead when it's bigger than ever.
[01:48:10.711 --> 01:48:16.296]  Or to tell us that the alternative media, nobody listens to it when it's bigger than ever.
[01:48:16.316 --> 01:48:23.722]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of this intentional mantras to try to tell us that we're not having victories when we really are.
[01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:30.873]  Well, again, yes, they're throwing every trick they can at us, but again, it's the tricks that they used back in the 1950s and the 1960s.
[01:48:31.313 --> 01:48:47.778]  I mean, the attacks I see on you, the attacks I see on myself, they have not changed one bit since the dirty tricks that were being played by the FBI informants on college campuses during the 1960s, when they were opposing the peace movement, when they were attacking the early civil rights movement, when they were attacking the early feminists.
[01:48:48.238 --> 01:48:52.302]  You know, all of these things they played, these games, they haven't changed one bit.
[01:48:52.643 --> 01:49:00.671]  The problem they don't understand, and they never got, is that your average American citizen understands that this stuff is out there.
[01:49:00.711 --> 01:49:06.077]  Now, every time I've gone to a local Peace March, there are always activists who are out there handing out flyers saying,
[01:49:06.417 --> 01:49:11.561]  This is what the government infiltrators will do to try and make us look bad, so don't fall for it.
[01:49:11.881 --> 01:49:14.043]  So these kids out there, they're smart.
[01:49:14.643 --> 01:49:15.704]  They know what's going on.
[01:49:15.744 --> 01:49:17.586]  They know how the FBI plays the game.
[01:49:17.846 --> 01:49:18.987]  They're ready to deal with it.
[01:49:19.267 --> 01:49:23.270]  And that is why all of these attacks that they're labeling on us right now on the internet,
[01:49:23.710 --> 01:49:27.915]  It isn't working because the American people are vastly different.
[01:49:27.955 --> 01:49:29.396]  They're vastly more educated.
[01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:30.337]  They're smarter.
[01:49:30.537 --> 01:49:33.821]  They understand the government lies and plays dirty tricks to get its way.
[01:49:34.201 --> 01:49:36.804]  And just that awareness... We'll take the Michelle Malkin.
[01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:42.570]  Fox News tried to set up 9-11 Truth saying that we attacked a girl in a wheelchair.
[01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:44.591]  That letter came out that was bull.
[01:49:44.891 --> 01:49:47.733]  They tried to say that I was saying kill Michelle Malkin and all that.
[01:49:48.194 --> 01:49:51.596]  We ended up defeating them and making them admit it wasn't true.
[01:49:52.117 --> 01:49:53.097]  Thanks to your help and others.
[01:49:53.137 --> 01:49:53.758]  So you're right.
[01:49:54.098 --> 01:49:56.700]  I mean they're playing the same old tricks and it's only revealing them.
[01:49:57.722 --> 01:50:11.060]  Yeah, it's become way, way too obvious that's what's going on and they really have never gotten a grip on the fact that the internet has fundamentally changed the nature of information flow through society.
[01:50:11.441 --> 01:50:12.522]  We're in the middle of a
[01:50:13.303 --> 01:50:20.827]  Cultural sociological revolution as great as when Gutenberg's movable type made printing inexpensive and affordable by the common people.
[01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:21.347]  It's greater!
[01:50:21.367 --> 01:50:22.048]  It is greater!
[01:50:22.608 --> 01:50:30.873]  And the ruling structures have either got to evolve to a world in which it's much more difficult to lie to the people or they're going to go extinct.
[01:50:30.913 --> 01:50:35.135]  And I think that's what's happening to the United States because it carries the burden of so many past lies.
[01:50:35.655 --> 01:50:36.836]  It can't be truthful now.
[01:50:38.508 --> 01:50:39.689]  Mike Rivera is our guest.

[01:50:45.534 --> 01:50:50.999]  Now is the time to ignore the diversions, the distractions, the lies, the frauds, the infighting, all of it.

[01:51:01.531 --> 01:51:11.199]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:51:11.299 --> 01:51:14.601]  Her face was every face I've ever known.
[01:51:14.982 --> 01:51:16.723]  Her face was my own face.
[01:51:17.023 --> 01:51:21.565]  GCN brings you Uncivil Liberties, a movie the government does not want you to see.

[01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:08.554]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:10.518]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:10.618 --> 01:52:16.993]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:17.652 --> 01:52:26.195]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:26.555 --> 01:52:33.337]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:52:33.637 --> 01:52:36.738]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:52:36.798 --> 01:52:42.580]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:45.201]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:54:11.681 --> 01:54:14.902]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:54:16.443 --> 01:54:19.725]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:54:22.046 --> 01:54:24.847]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[01:54:26.708 --> 01:54:29.609]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[01:54:33.975 --> 01:54:35.456]  Final segment with Mike Rivero.
[01:54:35.556 --> 01:54:39.959]  Always great to have him up with us once a month, sometimes even more often as things unfold.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.342]  I'm glad you brought up false flag terrorism.
[01:54:43.882 --> 01:54:46.404]  We've clearly seen economic false flag terrorism.
[01:54:46.424 --> 01:54:54.169]  Whether they engineered the first collapse or not, the fear-mongering, there would be a depression instantly if the bankers weren't given unlimited financial power.
[01:54:54.209 --> 01:54:56.691]  That was economic terrorism.
[01:54:56.711 --> 01:55:02.195]  And then last week there was a huge story put out by a white supremacist who always puts out disinfo.
[01:55:03.355 --> 01:55:07.339]  And just huge hoax after hoax that all the banks would fold on Monday.
[01:55:07.359 --> 01:55:12.824]  And then when it doesn't come true, my site and your site get blamed for it.
[01:55:12.864 --> 01:55:17.128]  When we were exposing it last week, of course, it was pushing for the banker bailout.
[01:55:17.709 --> 01:55:19.250]  So we're seeing a lot of that.
[01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:22.053]  But again, as you said, the public is developing a palette.
[01:55:22.822 --> 01:55:30.285]  You know, the taste buds to be able to recognize what's happening and what's really going on.
[01:55:30.745 --> 01:55:36.187]  Mike, so I wanted you to specifically talk about in the last three or four minutes we've got false flag terror.
[01:55:36.247 --> 01:55:38.548]  You brought up that that is a prime concern right now.
[01:55:38.688 --> 01:55:39.529]  I agree with you.
[01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:42.610]  The enemy has already staged many terror attacks in the past.
[01:55:42.650 --> 01:55:48.632]  They staged the 9-11 attack when it came out that they'd stolen trillions, upwards of two trillion from the Pentagon trust funds.
[01:55:48.992 --> 01:55:50.253]  That was in the AP the day before 9-11.
[01:55:51.605 --> 01:55:57.749]  We know that anytime there's a big economic collapse, that they like to have a staged terror attack to get people to rally around the state.
[01:55:58.030 --> 01:56:00.731]  Do you see that as an increased probability?
[01:56:02.212 --> 01:56:15.822]  Well, I'm sure there are people who are thinking it's good for another try right now, but I think the fact that the 9-11 Truth Movement has been so powerful and so vocal, and gotten the word out there, that that has been the deterrent to a new false flag terror attack.
[01:56:15.862 --> 01:56:20.465]  Because if you think about it, Bush is only four months away from being out of his office.
[01:56:21.005 --> 01:56:25.171]  And it means he's not going to get his Iran war, unless he tries something really desperate.
[01:56:25.412 --> 01:56:30.699]  That plane incident this morning may have been a last desperate gasp to create a situation justifying an invasion.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:34.825]  But the bottom line is, I think anybody who's thinking about it... Hold on!
[01:56:34.845 --> 01:56:35.707]  No lies over that!
[01:56:35.767 --> 01:56:37.169]  Tell folks about the plane incident.
[01:56:37.817 --> 01:56:45.043]  Okay, very briefly this morning, there was an airplane that was attempting to fly from Turkey to Afghanistan over Iran.
[01:56:46.144 --> 01:56:48.967]  Conflicting reports are that it was carrying senior U.S.
[01:56:49.007 --> 01:56:52.229]  military people, then the latest story said it was a Hungarian relief aid team.
[01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:59.516]  It was forced down because it was using an improper identification code, and the Iranians basically forced it down.
[01:56:59.596 --> 01:57:01.277]  But that happens here in the U.S.
[01:57:01.377 --> 01:57:02.058]  every day!
[01:57:02.078 --> 01:57:05.781]  If you don't have the right code, you get forced down!
[01:57:06.883 --> 01:57:11.746]  Well, anyway, the Iranian said, OK, you can go, and they let the plane continue on its way.
[01:57:12.106 --> 01:57:21.171]  And the reason it was interesting is because not too long ago, there was this revelation that George Bush had planned on allowing a U.S.
[01:57:21.211 --> 01:57:22.072]  plane with U.N.
[01:57:22.132 --> 01:57:26.735]  markings to get shot down over Iran as a pretext for invasion.
[01:57:27.295 --> 01:57:32.178]  And, you know, we had the ski boat incident and the captured British sailors incident.
[01:57:32.763 --> 01:57:37.667]  And Dick Cheney was talking about letting a bunch of seals get killed in order to trigger war with Iran.
[01:57:38.028 --> 01:57:41.711]  They've been really trying to figure out a way to get this thing going, and they haven't been able to.
[01:57:41.811 --> 01:57:46.955]  And the reason they can't is the American people are aware of the lies and deceptions.
[01:57:47.235 --> 01:57:50.718]  They are not falling for it ever again.
[01:57:50.778 --> 01:57:54.862]  You know, it's like Bush used to joke about, fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice, shame on me.
[01:57:56.723 --> 01:58:01.587]  And the American people remember that they were lied to about Saddam's nuclear bombs.
[01:58:01.627 --> 01:58:04.950]  They remember it because you constantly remind them, I constantly remind them.
[01:58:05.850 --> 01:58:10.234]  It makes it very difficult for the government to do, uh, to carry off further deceptions.
[01:58:10.314 --> 01:58:15.397]  Now we know that, uh, you know, Georgia actually initiated the recent conflict, uh, with Russia.
[01:58:15.477 --> 01:58:16.498]  Yeah, by the way, let me stop you.
[01:58:16.558 --> 01:58:17.499]  Let's do five more minutes.
[01:58:17.519 --> 01:58:19.060]  Then get Webster Tarpley on if you can.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:20.361]  Uh, Mike, you can do five more.
[01:58:20.381 --> 01:58:21.082]  Can't you finish up?
[01:58:21.782 --> 01:58:22.022]  Okay.
[01:58:22.422 --> 01:58:23.423]  We'll be back in one minute.
[01:58:24.023 --> 01:58:26.084]  Yeah, I forgot to even cover that two weeks ago.
[01:58:26.664 --> 01:58:35.768]  BBC, Times of London, AP, they all come out and say, okay, it's admitted, NATO admits, Georgia did launch a sneak attack and then lied to us.
[01:58:36.148 --> 01:58:37.568]  And that's plausible deniability.
[01:58:37.608 --> 01:58:38.329]  Of course, the U.S.
[01:58:38.349 --> 01:58:39.189]  was running the attack.
[01:58:39.209 --> 01:58:43.110]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.271 --> 01:58:47.992]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.463 --> 01:58:57.852]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:58:58.233 --> 01:59:00.195]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:00.856 --> 01:59:01.898]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:02.419 --> 01:59:02.959]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:04.041]  This is his MO.
[01:59:04.081 --> 01:59:05.563]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:05.603 --> 01:59:06.845]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:07.566 --> 01:59:14.312]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:14.712 --> 01:59:15.173]  Some U.S.
[01:59:15.193 --> 01:59:20.958]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:21.559 --> 01:59:25.002]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:25.242 --> 01:59:35.309]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:59:35.530 --> 01:59:36.290]  Fabled enemies.

[02:00:05.655 --> 02:00:06.315]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.976 --> 02:00:08.056]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.736 --> 02:00:09.877]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.497 --> 02:00:11.317]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.077 --> 02:00:13.598]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.638 --> 02:00:17.199]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.819 --> 02:00:21.921]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.667 --> 02:00:31.071]  We're good to go.
[02:00:42.791 --> 02:00:44.232]  You're right, Mike Rivera.
[02:00:44.252 --> 02:00:49.014]  I mean, it comes out that Dick Cheney was planning to stage terror attacks by having U.S.
[02:00:49.394 --> 02:00:52.435]  Navy SEALs dress up like Iranians and have them basically attack U.S.
[02:00:52.495 --> 02:00:53.655]  shipping, U.S.
[02:00:53.715 --> 02:00:57.617]  Naval larger craft, larger ships, and the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:00:58.097 --> 02:01:02.599]  And the fact is, that was then leaked from inside the White House and then confirmed.
[02:01:03.259 --> 02:01:04.620]  So another issue here is,
[02:01:06.207 --> 02:01:14.073]  A. We have friends in government at every level, a lot of which laughed at us at first, but now they see the full horror and understand just how serious this is.
[02:01:14.093 --> 02:01:17.275]  A lot of them are scared of prosecution, so they're trying to hedge their bets as well.
[02:01:17.295 --> 02:01:21.198]  Some of them aren't good, they're just trying to do the right thing for their selfish reasons.
[02:01:21.238 --> 02:01:25.801]  That's A. And then B. I want you to briefly comment on 9-11 Truth.
[02:01:26.621 --> 02:01:34.447]  Its victory, we always said going back seven years ago, plus was to expose false flag terror, bring it into the nomenclature, the public consciousness,
[02:01:35.487 --> 02:01:48.059]  So the people would look at Kibono, who benefits, and so that they would lose false flag terror as a useful tool of state's craft on the national and geopolitical realm globally.
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:51.443]  And so it's been a fabulous... I mean, are we going to get convictions?
[02:01:51.503 --> 02:01:52.023]  Jail time?
[02:01:52.063 --> 02:01:52.544]  Who knows?
[02:01:53.044 --> 02:01:55.947]  The point is, it's been a huge success and it's only growing.
[02:01:57.193 --> 02:02:01.635]  Well, we're never going to get convictions, we're never going to get jail time for the perpetrators, we're never going to get the U.S.
[02:02:01.675 --> 02:02:10.297]  government to admit what it did, and it doesn't really matter anyway, because we know what happened and I don't need the government to tell me that I'm correct in my conclusions.
[02:02:10.778 --> 02:02:17.820]  As you point out, the victory here is that we've educated the American people that these kind of things do go along.
[02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:23.642]  There were no torpedoes in the Gulf of Tonkin, the USS Maine was blown up by an onboard coal fire,
[02:02:24.289 --> 02:02:29.151]  Hoaxes are used to start wars all the time, and this was just another one.
[02:02:29.892 --> 02:02:45.059]  And knowing that, for the ordinary American man in the street, Main Street, USA, Joe Sixpack, whatever you want to call him, for him to be aware that the government stages these kind of tricks to start a war means it's far more difficult for the government to actually pull that off.
[02:02:45.519 --> 02:02:54.323]  Now, as I said before the break, our problem is that our current government is carrying so many lies throughout its history that it really cannot start being truthful.
[02:02:54.383 --> 02:02:58.124]  So it's just trying to follow the policy of if at first you don't succeed, lie, lie again.
[02:03:00.063 --> 02:03:09.545]  It's no longer in touch with the reality of its environment, and like any life form that gets out of touch with the reality of the changing environment, it's going to go extinct.
[02:03:09.605 --> 02:03:11.225]  It's just a question of how and when.
[02:03:11.645 --> 02:03:15.966]  We may be seeing the beginnings of the death throes right now.
[02:03:17.266 --> 02:03:24.147]  The collapse of the Soviet Union really did mark the end of the Cold War superpower mentality, and it's a little amazing that the U.S.
[02:03:24.328 --> 02:03:26.728]  has hung on to that mentality ever since then.
[02:03:27.248 --> 02:03:28.510]  We've got to pay for the empire!
[02:03:47.938 --> 02:03:53.405]  Yeah, we're paying for the empire, we're paying for the war machine, we're paying for all the money it's borrowed for the last hundred years.
[02:03:54.347 --> 02:04:00.394]  And the empire always wants to secure its home base, so we're gonna live in a slave-like homeland.
[02:04:00.595 --> 02:04:01.516]  So, yeah.
[02:04:02.566 --> 02:04:06.448]  Yeah, that's something that your listeners and readers really need to think about.
[02:04:06.768 --> 02:04:12.971]  If we were to work and sacrifice and accept 80-90% taxes to try and save the U.S.
[02:04:13.011 --> 02:04:16.892]  government from its own folly, what do we get at the end of all that sacrifice?
[02:04:17.193 --> 02:04:25.656]  We still get a government that is reading our emails, listening to our phone calls, watching us with TV cameras all the time, refusing to trust us, groping us at the airports.
[02:04:26.597 --> 02:04:29.578]  Why should we work hard for somebody who treats us that badly?
[02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:35.513]  When the easiest thing is to say, okay, I'm just going to coast for a while and let the U.S.
[02:04:35.553 --> 02:04:38.834]  government drive itself off the cliff, and I refuse to follow behind it.
[02:04:39.395 --> 02:04:41.856]  Yeah, there have been empires that actually reward their minions.
[02:04:42.276 --> 02:04:44.838]  This one is viciously attacking its minions.
[02:04:45.198 --> 02:04:46.479]  The worst possible scenario.
[02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:48.540]  WhatReallyHappened.com, Mike Rivera.

[02:07:04.107 --> 02:07:09.628]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:15.349]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:07:15.609 --> 02:07:16.770]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:17.090 --> 02:07:25.972]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:06.414]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.774 --> 02:08:09.095]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:12.017 --> 02:08:16.941]  Okay, Webster Griffin and Tarpley have been joining us quite a bit lately as the election heats up into the last month.
[02:08:18.829 --> 02:08:22.231]  He talked about how McCain's a dead duck, has no political support.
[02:08:22.291 --> 02:08:25.573]  If he was to get elected, it would be more stagnant New World Order.
[02:08:25.613 --> 02:08:32.997]  But Barack Obama is getting three times the financial support that McCain is from Wall Street and the CFR Foundation elites.
[02:08:33.498 --> 02:08:34.758]  And I didn't just believe Tarpley.
[02:08:34.798 --> 02:08:38.640]  I was aware of those numbers, and I've been looking more into them, and it's actually more than three times.
[02:08:39.481 --> 02:08:40.762]  And so that's a bad sign.
[02:08:40.862 --> 02:08:48.066]  And then, you know, I played this on air two weeks ago, a week and a half ago to be technical, and listeners couldn't believe it.
[02:08:48.684 --> 02:08:49.865]  I played Missouri, St.
[02:08:49.885 --> 02:08:58.929]  Louis TV stations, read news articles where the police said, there's a law in ethics against lying about Obama, and we will decide what a lie is.
[02:08:59.029 --> 02:09:01.750]  If you say he's anti-gun, we will come and arrest you.
[02:09:02.570 --> 02:09:03.791]  And you know, they said all those things.
[02:09:03.811 --> 02:09:05.471]  They said, we will come out and deal with you.
[02:09:05.952 --> 02:09:08.993]  They said, if you say he's a Muslim, we're coming after you.
[02:09:09.053 --> 02:09:09.933]  If you say this or that.
[02:09:10.854 --> 02:09:13.735]  And regardless if it's true or not, it's your First Amendment right.
[02:09:13.775 --> 02:09:16.596]  If somebody wants to sue you for civil damages, that's the case.
[02:09:19.367 --> 02:09:20.328]  But not criminal.
[02:09:20.368 --> 02:09:24.471]  And then it popped up in Illinois, and Connecticut, and Vermont, and all over.
[02:09:24.491 --> 02:09:30.797]  And then I had callers call me off-air and threaten me when I had Tarpley on a week and a half ago, saying, you need to be arrested, Alex.
[02:09:30.877 --> 02:09:33.259]  I used to be a fan of you, but you talk bad about Barack Obama.
[02:09:33.499 --> 02:09:35.080]  You're trying to help that bastard Bush.
[02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.142]  You work for him, and you're going to get it, too.
[02:09:37.622 --> 02:09:41.065]  And then they called on-air and told Tarpley, I want to come down there to the studio.
[02:09:41.085 --> 02:09:42.346]  And I was like, are you joking?
[02:09:42.846 --> 02:09:55.675]  And by the way, one of these people I know, vaguely from events and things, kind of a mainline Republican, was now literally under some type of Machiavellian Beelzebub spell, saying he wants to arrest Tarpley.
[02:09:56.375 --> 02:10:03.500]  And then now, Jerome Corsi, I interviewed him at the DNC a month ago, he said he was going to Kenya soon, he'd come on after he got back.
[02:10:04.515 --> 02:10:06.376]  He was going to check the birth certificate.
[02:10:06.396 --> 02:10:10.578]  He was going to, you know, go see the brother who lives in a shack.
[02:10:11.699 --> 02:10:13.380]  You know, that Barack Obama doesn't help.
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:16.802]  I mean, you know, I have a right to say these things about Bin Laden.
[02:10:16.862 --> 02:10:17.842]  I don't need to be threatened.
[02:10:18.643 --> 02:10:21.524]  And see, this really, I mean, this is real.
[02:10:21.564 --> 02:10:22.645]  This is happening to me.
[02:10:23.065 --> 02:10:24.526]  This is happening to Dr. Corsi.
[02:10:24.746 --> 02:10:25.927]  I don't care what you think about him.
[02:10:25.967 --> 02:10:28.008]  They haven't challenged what he claimed in the book.
[02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:34.075]  They have only been challenging his credibility, or saying he's bad, or something he said on the message board five years ago.
[02:10:34.896 --> 02:10:45.284]  And the point is, is that they really are in- I mean, they arrested another individual who went to the National Press Club to speak out against him, official speaker, and then Biden's son had him arrested.
[02:10:45.745 --> 02:10:58.415]  I mean, this- can you- look, when Bill Clinton was bringing in tyranny, I was against him, but said he was a puppet of the New World Order, of the Global Crime Syndicate, the Anglo-American establishment, a CIA operative, left cover,
[02:10:59.162 --> 02:11:10.366]  I went on air, I covered that, how he had Cord Meyer as his handler over in London station, and people said, how dare you right-wing scum filth?
[02:11:11.167 --> 02:11:19.430]  And then George Bush came in and I said, he's destroying the Bill of Rights Constitution, setting up edicts and martial law and gutting the economy and secret arrest and torture.
[02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:21.851]  How dare you, you communist piece of filth?
[02:11:22.555 --> 02:11:28.297]  And now I'm saying, hey, when McCain calls for using troops on the streets to, quote, fight crime, that's bad.
[02:11:28.677 --> 02:11:29.378]  That's fascism.
[02:11:29.598 --> 02:11:30.098]  That's tyranny.
[02:11:30.938 --> 02:11:31.819]  And I get called a commie.
[02:11:32.139 --> 02:11:38.481]  And then I say, man, what Barack Obama's doing, way over and above what McCain's doing, because he has the star appeal.
[02:11:38.741 --> 02:11:42.143]  He has the well-meaning drones, who are just out of control.
[02:11:42.523 --> 02:11:44.523]  It's, we're gonna get you, Alex Jones.
[02:11:44.583 --> 02:11:46.024]  So, Tarpley is right.
[02:11:46.484 --> 02:11:51.066]  Webster Tarpley was absolutely right ten months ago when he started doing this, and he's got two books out now on it.
[02:11:51.835 --> 02:12:01.207]  Because Obama, and that's what the establishment has said, he will bring people back into trusting government, back into going along with the system, back into the new youth brigades.
[02:12:01.647 --> 02:12:02.188]  It's true.
[02:12:02.288 --> 02:12:03.430]  Tarpley is right.
[02:12:03.850 --> 02:12:06.714]  So Webster, I want you to break him down, then let's get into the economy.
[02:12:07.665 --> 02:12:08.685]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:12:08.725 --> 02:12:13.027]  Let me just point to two immediate, or maybe three immediate breaking stories.
[02:12:13.527 --> 02:12:20.710]  The first is, as you said, Jerome Corsi, who is, of course, I would call him a neocon.
[02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:28.193]  I don't agree with him on many issues, but he's written a very useful biography of Obama called Obama Nation.
[02:12:29.019 --> 02:12:34.084]  Which tells a significant amount of things that you need to know about Obama.
[02:12:34.164 --> 02:12:35.785]  I would say it doesn't go far enough.
[02:12:35.865 --> 02:12:43.492]  It doesn't make the case of Obama as a poverty pimp, as a foundation operative, and therefore, in a general sense, a government agent.
[02:12:44.250 --> 02:12:49.152]  And the deployment of this Brzezinski, Rockefeller, Soros trilateral group.
[02:12:49.172 --> 02:12:50.932]  He doesn't have anything in there about that.
[02:12:50.952 --> 02:12:56.394]  He talks about him as a kind of a communist or socialist and or Muslim.
[02:12:57.034 --> 02:12:58.594]  And that is a certain level of truth.
[02:12:58.995 --> 02:13:00.435]  Because that's part of his left cover.
[02:13:00.455 --> 02:13:02.936]  That's like Sherrod Lawton as the Muslim extremist.
[02:13:03.376 --> 02:13:05.276]  Really a CIA asset, Tim Osman.
[02:13:05.517 --> 02:13:06.137]  It's the same thing.
[02:13:06.177 --> 02:13:13.199]  You see the foundation creature literally taken from high school and put in to build this cred, this street cred.
[02:13:13.619 --> 02:13:16.562]  Right, with a cover story, as you quite properly say.
[02:13:16.962 --> 02:13:26.191]  So, the question of course is, we have the Philberg lawsuit in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in that lawsuit,
[02:13:26.886 --> 02:13:31.087]  The Obama campaign has now made two legal steps.
[02:13:31.147 --> 02:13:34.928]  The first one was a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
[02:13:34.968 --> 02:13:43.011]  Filberg is asking, we want to see proof that Obama is constitutionally qualified to be the President of the United States.
[02:13:43.051 --> 02:13:45.991]  We want to see that he was born inside the U.S.
[02:13:46.171 --> 02:13:47.692]  or a territory or a possession.
[02:13:48.312 --> 02:13:53.336]  And secondly, that he is still a citizen, that he didn't give up his citizenship at some point.
[02:13:53.577 --> 02:13:58.260]  So the first response of the Obama campaign to that is, we want to dismiss it, we want to throw it out.
[02:13:58.641 --> 02:14:00.903]  The judge has not granted the motion to dismiss.
[02:14:00.923 --> 02:14:04.786]  You want to think if he really was a proper U.S.
[02:14:04.806 --> 02:14:12.892]  citizen or eligible run for president, his mother living here 18 years before she had him, that would be the level he need to clear legally.
[02:14:15.726 --> 02:14:20.289]  You would think they'd want to answer this nagging question, but they never answer these nagging questions.
[02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:21.590]  That's exactly the point.
[02:14:21.630 --> 02:14:24.732]  Now, the second one is that they say, we want to delay discovery.
[02:14:24.752 --> 02:14:31.536]  In other words, the moment where production, where documents have to be produced, or even, you know, interviews, depositions have to be taken.
[02:14:31.876 --> 02:14:32.937]  They say, we want to delay that.
[02:14:34.221 --> 02:14:35.762]  Now, this stinks to high heaven.
[02:14:35.803 --> 02:14:40.827]  This, to me, indicates that he is not a citizen, that he is not natural born and or not a citizen.
[02:14:41.147 --> 02:14:54.740]  I don't know which one it is, because Philberg's website, as people know, obamacrimes.com, has had something approaching 20 million visitors now in about five or six weeks, so this is a serious
[02:14:55.460 --> 02:15:08.532]  If Obama wants to be president, he must produce the so-called vault copy of his birth certificate showing that he was born in Hawaii, if that's where he was born.
[02:15:09.361 --> 02:15:25.213]  And if there's also this question about when his mother, the pro-communist anthropologist, Stanley Ann Dunham, moved to Indonesia with her husband Lolo Sotero, he may well have lost his citizenship as part of being sort of adopted by Lolo Sotero.
[02:15:25.313 --> 02:15:26.554]  I mean, that's what's so incredible.
[02:15:26.594 --> 02:15:27.735]  Look at all the foundations.
[02:15:28.533 --> 02:15:33.940]  You know, they didn't give us a black guy from the United States with a clear, you know, pedigree as a citizen and nobody care.
[02:15:34.361 --> 02:15:35.663]  It's gotta have all this.
[02:15:35.703 --> 02:15:38.647]  That's meant to stir up the left and right once he gets in.
[02:15:38.687 --> 02:15:42.111]  I mean, the name, Barack Obama, you couldn't write a script like this.
[02:15:43.513 --> 02:15:52.676]  Well, this many complicated things feed into that, but I think that the basic legal question that really everybody should be able to agree on is, the Constitution has to be respected.
[02:15:53.076 --> 02:15:55.077]  It's either Constitution or Civil War.
[02:15:55.357 --> 02:16:00.859]  I'll take the Constitution any day, and that means the President has got to fulfill those requirements.
[02:16:00.879 --> 02:16:04.300]  So let the Obama campaign put this entire issue to rest.
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:12.107]  By coming forward with the detailed, or vault, V-A-U-L-T copy of the original birth certificate of Obama.
[02:16:12.127 --> 02:16:13.087]  They refused to do this.
[02:16:13.127 --> 02:16:17.952]  Now, related to that is, what was Corsi going to announce in Kenya?
[02:16:18.512 --> 02:16:20.454]  He obviously went to Kenya, it seems to me.
[02:16:20.734 --> 02:16:22.896]  And by the way, last time I checked, he's still in custody.
[02:16:22.936 --> 02:16:26.539]  He was supposedly there looking for birth records of Mr. Obama.
[02:16:26.579 --> 02:16:26.679]  Yes!
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:27.560]  This is it!
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:32.044]  He's looking for the birth certificate of Obama in Kenya, because there's a growing body of evidence
[02:16:32.444 --> 02:16:34.987]  That Obama was actually born in Kenya.
[02:16:35.047 --> 02:16:39.132]  And the police go out and grab him in the streets after he already got into the country.
[02:16:39.713 --> 02:16:40.454]  It's outrageous.
[02:16:40.554 --> 02:16:46.421]  And it seems to me now, let's see what these people from the American Civil Liberties Union are made of.
[02:16:46.882 --> 02:16:50.186]  All the human rights groups, Human Rights Watch, Africa Watch.
[02:16:51.027 --> 02:16:53.069]  Uh, you know, Amnesty International.
[02:16:53.169 --> 02:16:55.752]  Are they going to come forward and say, free Jerome Corsi?
[02:16:56.012 --> 02:17:00.116]  There's another guy with him, whose name I don't have, who's also been arrested.
[02:17:00.517 --> 02:17:03.540]  It seems to me that they were probably thrown in jail.
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:05.963]  There's a good possibility that they were thrown in jail.
[02:17:06.363 --> 02:17:08.225]  No, they're being held.
[02:17:08.426 --> 02:17:10.588]  They've been held for at least 20 hours, it looks like.
[02:17:10.968 --> 02:17:12.449]  And I would recommend the following.
[02:17:12.469 --> 02:17:14.330]  There's a Kenyan embassy here in Washington.
[02:17:14.370 --> 02:17:15.670]  Maybe I just give the phone number.
[02:17:15.710 --> 02:17:18.112]  Why don't you call them up and give them a piece of your mind?
[02:17:18.572 --> 02:17:23.834]  This is 202-387-6101.
[02:17:23.855 --> 02:17:24.775]  202-387-6101.
[02:17:26.096 --> 02:17:29.477]  Call them and say, free Corsi and free his assistant.
[02:17:29.998 --> 02:17:31.558]  And this, of course, what regime is this?
[02:17:31.618 --> 02:17:34.240]  This is Obama's cousin is doing this.
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.380]  This is Odinga.
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:38.722]  This is Ryla Odinga, who is... Let me just add this.
[02:17:39.282 --> 02:17:40.623]  This isn't about him being black.
[02:17:40.703 --> 02:17:45.007]  I made a film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, the last third of it, an hour.
[02:17:45.567 --> 02:17:48.950]  It's about Arnold Schwarzenegger's dad, the SS captain, running a whole area.
[02:17:49.371 --> 02:17:54.195]  His mother, after his dad dies, marries the number two in the SS in Austria.
[02:17:54.215 --> 02:18:00.680]  He runs around saying he loves Hitler, wants to be a dictator, so he shouldn't be able to be governor, he shouldn't be able to be president.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.284]  You know, we're against foreigners, and that's why we have laws against that, because in Europe,
[02:18:06.218 --> 02:18:09.200]  We had Austria, of all places, that specialized.
[02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:11.903]  You're a historian, you know this, Webster.
[02:18:11.923 --> 02:18:17.687]  200 years ago, plus, in trying to send in their people into other areas of Europe to take it over.
[02:18:18.268 --> 02:18:20.109]  And so that's why countries have laws.
[02:18:20.209 --> 02:18:22.711]  You've got to have a clear pedigree in that country.
[02:18:22.731 --> 02:18:28.876]  It goes back to the CIA and FBI wouldn't trust somebody to be high-level if you didn't have four or five generations here.
[02:18:29.984 --> 02:18:39.894]  Yes, well, in this case, the Constitution is absolutely categorical, that you've got to be born in a state territorial possession, and you've got to be a citizen.
[02:18:40.134 --> 02:18:42.276]  And I think that's the big question for Obama.
[02:18:43.017 --> 02:18:49.503]  The other side of it, of course, is suppose Obama gets into office with this horrible secret, there's another way they can blackmail him.
[02:18:49.543 --> 02:18:51.285]  In other words, the banking establishment...
[02:18:51.305 --> 02:18:55.793]  Guys, Webster, why are they so ready to threaten arrest, order arrest, or to bully?
[02:18:55.853 --> 02:19:00.361]  I mean, they are acting like George Bush before George Bush even got in office.
[02:19:00.962 --> 02:19:04.749]  They're doing Hitlerian police state things before they even have the power.
[02:19:05.273 --> 02:19:08.375]  Well, this is what I tried to call attention to, these two books, right?
[02:19:08.455 --> 02:19:22.764]  Obama, The Postmodern Crew, The Making of a Manchurian Candidate, which you have, I believe, in your bookshop, and Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography, which you may have, or which is otherwise at Amazon for people who want to get it there.
[02:19:24.024 --> 02:19:26.546]  The question of the fascist mass movement, I think, is central.
[02:19:27.206 --> 02:19:28.147]  Under Bush, Cheney
[02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:34.211]  You could expect probably the worst thing that's gonna happen to you is a couple of FBI agents come and harass you.
[02:19:34.712 --> 02:19:36.073]  And this of course is unpleasant.
[02:19:36.453 --> 02:19:44.859]  But it's in no relation to a fascist mob that comes to burn you out, beat you up, kill you, rape your wife, and so forth.
[02:19:44.899 --> 02:19:49.583]  This is the difference between an authoritarian police state and a fascist mass movement.
[02:19:49.743 --> 02:19:50.664]  Well there's no doubt
[02:19:51.245 --> 02:19:53.369]  He's got the posse.
[02:19:53.770 --> 02:19:55.092]  Obama has a posse.
[02:19:55.473 --> 02:19:59.822]  They're ready to come after anybody that speaks out against him, and that's un-American.
[02:19:59.882 --> 02:20:00.844]  Webster Tarr, please stay with us.

[02:20:44.329 --> 02:20:44.749]  I think so.
[02:21:01.252 --> 02:21:07.641]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:08.022 --> 02:21:09.964]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:10.665 --> 02:21:11.687]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:12.208 --> 02:21:12.728]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:13.009 --> 02:21:13.830]  This is his MO.
[02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:15.312]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:15.372 --> 02:21:16.834]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:17.354 --> 02:21:24.099]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:24.499 --> 02:21:24.939]  Some U.S.
[02:21:24.979 --> 02:21:30.783]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:21:31.344 --> 02:21:34.786]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:21:35.046 --> 02:21:45.076]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:21:45.316 --> 02:21:46.077]  Fabled enemies.

[02:22:01.001 --> 02:22:10.111]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[02:22:10.272 --> 02:22:18.321]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[02:22:18.461 --> 02:22:21.084]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1%
[02:22:22.105 --> 02:22:25.647]  Of all cases, don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.

[02:23:53.959 --> 02:23:57.122]  Alright Webster, let's finish up with Obama because
[02:24:17.702 --> 02:24:19.623]  The New World Order are really racist.
[02:24:19.863 --> 02:24:20.903]  I found that at the top.
[02:24:20.923 --> 02:24:23.824]  I mean, look at their exterminating blacks all over Africa.
[02:24:24.704 --> 02:24:27.305]  People worldwide, period, but they particularly hate Africans.
[02:24:27.825 --> 02:24:34.267]  Imagine, they may forever destroy the name of black politicians in Western politics.
[02:24:35.347 --> 02:24:37.228]  They've hired so many other monsters in Africa.
[02:24:37.248 --> 02:24:44.310]  I mean, could it be that that's the president will have with the FEMA camps and the roundups and with vitriolic, you know, that will get the
[02:24:45.203 --> 02:24:48.646]  The inner city folks behind it, like you said, the left cover.
[02:24:49.026 --> 02:24:52.729]  I'm really starting to get horrified that it looks like your right, Webster.
[02:24:54.011 --> 02:25:02.037]  The difference is, when you have a top-down dictatorship, which is simply a police state, it becomes more and more oppressive.
[02:25:02.097 --> 02:25:08.503]  And this police state would still have a long ways to go until it got as oppressive as a police state dictatorship could be.
[02:25:09.063 --> 02:25:12.286]  You reach a point where the police are no longer enough,
[02:25:13.027 --> 02:25:27.551]  And the army is not reliable, because if you've seen so many revolutions, you know, Bolshevik Revolution, a couple of divisions arrive, they're supposed to quell the rebellion in the city, and they go over and support the insurrection or the revolution or whatever it is.
[02:25:28.071 --> 02:25:31.532]  Therefore, there's got to be a third element added, and this is what
[02:25:32.941 --> 02:25:48.870]  What came out of Italy in 1919, which is a fascist mass movement, which is initially composed of left-wing socialists, revolutionary socialists... And we've now seen the CIA in Eastern Europe doing the very same color revolutions that give them grassroots cover.
[02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:56.094]  They've reduced this to a cookbook, but revolutionary socialists like Mussolini, the creative class, you've got to remember that the
[02:25:56.494 --> 02:26:05.697]  The most prominent writer in Italy, D'Annunzio, the most prominent painter, Marinetti, the most prominent sculptor, the most prominent architect, all were fascists!
[02:26:06.078 --> 02:26:18.262]  So the idea that intellectuals like Obama and so forth, or university students, remember that university students... Well they even got, Mussolini got the famous US playwright who had won all the big prizes.
[02:26:18.362 --> 02:26:19.062]  What was his name?
[02:26:19.342 --> 02:26:20.983]  He wrote the first book on the Federal Reserve.
[02:26:21.803 --> 02:26:22.844]  Oh, what was his name?
[02:26:22.924 --> 02:26:23.485]  Ezra Pound.
[02:26:23.525 --> 02:26:24.686]  Yes, that's a little bit later.
[02:26:24.986 --> 02:26:36.175]  Ezra Pound, the sort of fascist poet, I guess, became a... He did radio broadcasts for Mussolini, but in the original movement, a lot of people were very excited about this.
[02:26:36.475 --> 02:26:39.478]  In particular, university students, university professors.
[02:26:39.958 --> 02:26:44.081]  Campuses, generally speaking, were hotbeds of fascism and Nazism.
[02:26:44.101 --> 02:26:47.964]  So the idea that students like Obama... This isn't automatically a good thing.
[02:26:48.004 --> 02:26:53.728]  This is not... And by the way, those who don't think there weren't black fascists and even Nazis don't know the history.
[02:26:53.788 --> 02:26:59.032]  The Nazis had giant African corps of black Nazis, Asian Nazis.
[02:27:00.539 --> 02:27:06.260]  Well, it had a worldwide appeal, but I think that the race issue is really not the main thing.
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:18.283]  The race issue is a tool, but the... No, I know, but the public is thinking of a black guy, and they're saying it's impossible that he could be a fascist, because fascism has falsely a racial connotation because of the Nazi strength.
[02:27:18.543 --> 02:27:24.784]  You've also got to look at fascism in the defeated countries of World War I, like Germany, Italy was one thing.
[02:27:25.144 --> 02:27:29.165]  But there's also, as I go through in this book, Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography.
[02:27:29.705 --> 02:27:31.867]  There are also two cases that we would like to point to.
[02:27:31.987 --> 02:27:33.908]  One is fascism in Britain.
[02:27:34.068 --> 02:27:46.516]  There was a group called the British Union of Fascists with Sir Oswald Mosley, and this was a kind of a pro-Hitler, pro-Mussolini group inside Britain, and they were not warlike in any particular way.
[02:27:46.576 --> 02:27:49.598]  As a matter of fact, their idea was to keep Britain out of the war
[02:27:49.978 --> 02:27:55.000]  While Hitler went after Stalin, they would make sure that Britain did not get involved in the war.
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:57.580]  So this is maybe a little bit similar to what's going on now.
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:02.802]  The Brzezinskis... And his son is the head of Formula One and just got caught in the big Nazi orgy.
[02:28:03.262 --> 02:28:03.602]  Really?
[02:28:03.942 --> 02:28:09.504]  And then you have the other one, there's a French example, the so-called French Popular Party, Parti Populaire Francais.
[02:28:10.004 --> 02:28:15.969]  With a leader who was a former communist, and they're also pretty much on this line, let's not get involved in foreign wars.
[02:28:16.310 --> 02:28:19.312]  And then you have to ask, what are the main constituents of fascism?
[02:28:19.352 --> 02:28:25.418]  Well, these things like the founding of a new man, the overcoming of class struggle, very important.
[02:28:25.778 --> 02:28:30.021]  No partisanship, no class struggle, but only national unity.
[02:28:30.061 --> 02:28:32.123]  It's exactly what Obama preaches the whole time.
[02:28:32.183 --> 02:28:35.945]  Anyway, in my book I go through about a dozen characteristics of this.
[02:28:36.226 --> 02:28:38.707]  One of the interesting characteristics is a hatred of women.
[02:28:39.068 --> 02:28:45.152]  If you had to say what is a key characteristic that fascist movements from Salazar in Portugal
[02:28:45.652 --> 02:28:46.633]  We're good to go.
[02:29:06.551 --> 02:29:11.935]  Is the one who has a fascist movement or a reasonable facsimile thereof.
[02:29:11.995 --> 02:29:17.279]  What I mean by that is, the Mussolini's march on Rome had a big element of political theater in it.
[02:29:17.699 --> 02:29:24.284]  And indeed, the army commander at that time said to the king, look, if I open fire for five minutes, I can sweep these people away.
[02:29:24.524 --> 02:29:25.085]  That's true.
[02:29:25.305 --> 02:29:30.929]  But they needed the appearance of a mass movement so that you can impose austerity and then go to war.
[02:29:32.561 --> 02:29:36.963]  And now we have them with the eugenics carbon taxes being set up in Europe and the U.S.
[02:29:37.363 --> 02:29:38.903]  All set up with the fake right wing.
[02:29:38.943 --> 02:29:40.164]  People rebuke it, bring in the left.
[02:29:40.304 --> 02:29:41.644]  Yes, that's it.
[02:29:41.924 --> 02:29:42.224]  Stay there.
[02:29:43.065 --> 02:29:43.345]  Stay there.
[02:29:43.365 --> 02:29:44.465]  We gotta break Webster Darfley.
[02:29:44.845 --> 02:29:46.206]  Riveting, powerful, compelling.
[02:29:46.226 --> 02:29:47.426]  We'll talk to you after a quick break.
[02:29:51.948 --> 02:29:52.848]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.328 --> 02:29:54.949]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:58.550]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.858 --> 02:30:07.526]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[02:30:07.806 --> 02:30:12.593]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[02:30:12.833 --> 02:30:16.678]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals
[02:30:16.698 --> 02:30:16.998]  I think so.
[02:30:35.077 --> 02:30:36.778]  May I have everybody's attention?
[02:31:07.619 --> 02:31:08.419]  Same side job!
[02:31:08.479 --> 02:31:10.020]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:11.640]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:19.323]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged, wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[02:31:19.383 --> 02:31:27.886]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:31:27.926 --> 02:31:32.748]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:31:40.682 --> 02:31:44.064]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:31:44.244 --> 02:31:46.605]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:31:46.705 --> 02:31:53.389]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[02:31:58.552 --> 02:32:01.054]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:32:01.494 --> 02:32:16.726]  You know, as a father and a husband, one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children, checking up on my wife, making sure she has the things she needs, but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they're secure, that they feel comfortable every day in their little skins.
[02:32:16.826 --> 02:32:21.109]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives.
[02:32:21.269 --> 02:32:29.275]  I've always wanted to be a good provider, and I'm not going to change that now just because the economy's in upheaval and because there's a lot of political and social uncertainty.
[02:32:29.275 --> 02:32:29.495]  I think?
[02:32:48.490 --> 02:32:51.114]  I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.
[02:32:51.214 --> 02:32:52.677]  Call eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:32:52.757 --> 02:32:54.219]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:32:54.600 --> 02:32:54.800]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:55.261]  Call them today.
[02:32:55.301 --> 02:32:55.922]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:33:07.554 --> 02:33:08.075]  I don't think so.
[02:33:30.123 --> 02:33:34.806]  They love to throw the power to the right and throw it to the left in the control paradigm.
[02:33:35.446 --> 02:33:39.628]  Right now you got Obama about nine points ahead in most polls.
[02:33:40.369 --> 02:33:46.252]  It's a dead heat with Obama maybe one more electoral college point than McCain right now.
[02:33:48.228 --> 02:33:50.108]  And I've been watching the media carefully.
[02:33:50.128 --> 02:33:52.769]  There's clearly a bias against John McCain.
[02:33:53.009 --> 02:33:54.549]  And folks, John McCain's pure evil.
[02:33:55.069 --> 02:33:56.490]  I'm not supporting John McCain here.
[02:33:56.530 --> 02:33:57.710]  I'm just reporting the facts.
[02:33:57.770 --> 02:33:59.850]  And every day, more evidence is piled on.
[02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:04.051]  Dr. Corsi arrested, kidnapped, being held by the government.
[02:34:04.111 --> 02:34:08.872]  He got in and they found him on the streets, out trying to... And I talked to him.
[02:34:09.272 --> 02:34:13.293]  He said he was going, off the record, to Kenya to try to get
[02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:14.661]  The birth certificate.
[02:34:14.681 --> 02:34:17.343]  He said, I'll be going there to prove that, but don't talk about that yet.
[02:34:17.783 --> 02:34:21.206]  He said, I'll talk to you after I get back from Kenya in a month and a half, right before the election.
[02:34:21.926 --> 02:34:22.847]  I saw him in Denver.
[02:34:22.867 --> 02:34:24.108]  You saw the interview we did.
[02:34:24.288 --> 02:34:25.429]  He told us that off air.
[02:34:26.109 --> 02:34:29.051]  And so I can confirm he was there snooping around for that.
[02:34:29.432 --> 02:34:31.914]  And then they went out into the city and grabbed him.
[02:34:31.974 --> 02:34:36.017]  The federal police of Kenya, which is not, I mean, which is
[02:34:36.497 --> 02:34:45.439]  He's not normally been a police state, but has a new leader related to Obama, and Obama supported his campaign, who is arresting dissidents, and that's in a separate area.
[02:34:45.679 --> 02:34:50.719]  He is definitely internationally aligned with thugs, and folks, we don't discriminate here.
[02:34:50.759 --> 02:34:57.381]  That's why we can say a black guy can be just as evil as a white guy, and Barack Obama's got very evil people behind him.
[02:34:57.681 --> 02:34:58.801]  Continue, Webster Tarboy.
[02:34:59.301 --> 02:35:03.462]  Concerning this, Odinga, in my view, is a CIA agent.
[02:35:03.562 --> 02:35:04.682]  In other words, he's a U.S.
[02:35:04.762 --> 02:35:05.082]  puppet.
[02:35:05.649 --> 02:35:15.914]  But in order to consolidate power, you have the Luo ethnic group, or the Luo tribe, to which Obama and Odinga both belong.
[02:35:16.354 --> 02:35:21.997]  They have stipulated this alliance with a group of Islamic fundamentalists, I think also clients of the CIA.
[02:35:22.117 --> 02:35:24.298]  Again, there's that Muslim situation.
[02:35:24.358 --> 02:35:25.479]  It just keeps popping up.
[02:35:26.599 --> 02:35:29.281]  He goes to Muslim schools, and I'm not even attacking Muslims here.
[02:35:29.541 --> 02:35:31.782]  The point is, is that where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:35:32.795 --> 02:35:35.137]  It is obviously a U.S.
[02:35:35.357 --> 02:35:37.659]  strategy for the destabilization of the area.
[02:35:38.039 --> 02:35:45.104]  The largest ethnic group in Kenya is the Kikuyu ethnic group, and they've dominated the government for most of the time.
[02:35:45.464 --> 02:35:49.487]  But now we've just had a kind of color revolution or CIA people power coup.
[02:35:50.067 --> 02:36:02.378]  Led by this guy Odinga, with Obama going over there and campaigning for him, to the point where the previous government said, Obama, you're acting as a stooge for the State Department and interfering in our internal affairs.
[02:36:02.438 --> 02:36:03.419]  So why don't you get out of here?
[02:36:03.439 --> 02:36:05.200]  So it's not right against black.
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:08.403]  In this case, it's two black... Well, that's just like the U.N.
[02:36:08.463 --> 02:36:13.207]  engineering the slaughter for oil fields in Rwanda with the Hutus against the Tutsis.
[02:36:13.227 --> 02:36:13.728]  Same story.
[02:36:14.108 --> 02:36:17.272]  Right, and in this case, look, Odinga has two children.
[02:36:17.332 --> 02:36:21.838]  He has a son named Raul, named after Raul Castro.
[02:36:21.858 --> 02:36:22.659]  Alright, fine.
[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:27.245]  But then he's got a daughter named Winnie, after Winnie Mandela.
[02:36:27.285 --> 02:36:30.189]  And you remember that Winnie Mandela was famous for murdering...
[02:36:30.829 --> 02:36:31.690]  Murdering people.
[02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:40.733]  She murdered Steve, or she was part of a group that murdered a very famous activist named Steve Biko, who she regarded as a competitor.
[02:36:41.033 --> 02:36:46.336]  And they put gasoline in the tire, hanging around their head, and then it melts over them.
[02:36:46.656 --> 02:36:49.877]  Yeah, this is the... No, Odinga supports necklacing.
[02:36:50.197 --> 02:36:57.920]  So Mr. Necklacing, Burn Baby Burn of Kenya, is now Obama's great friend and ally.
[02:36:58.081 --> 02:36:58.881]  I would urge people,
[02:36:59.341 --> 02:37:01.042]  This is a point really to mobilize.
[02:37:01.082 --> 02:37:02.843]  Now, Corsi is being held over there.
[02:37:03.083 --> 02:37:07.385]  Whatever you think of Corsi, you know, you don't have to embrace all of his politics.
[02:37:07.465 --> 02:37:10.507]  We should support investigative journalists, whether we love them or hate them.
[02:37:10.547 --> 02:37:12.848]  Give us, you know, I think we should be calling the U.S.
[02:37:12.888 --> 02:37:18.771]  State Department and the media instead of the Kenyan little CIA field office.
[02:37:18.811 --> 02:37:20.191]  But let me, let's give out the Kenyan number.
[02:37:20.211 --> 02:37:20.892]  Great idea!
[02:37:21.352 --> 02:37:22.372]  The Kenyan embassy is 202.
[02:37:23.473 --> 02:37:23.933]  3-8-7-6-1-0-1.
[02:37:23.953 --> 02:37:24.714]  2-0-2-3-8-7-6-1-0-1.
[02:37:24.734 --> 02:37:29.317]  You're very right, Alex.
[02:37:29.377 --> 02:37:30.718]  It should be that the U.S.
[02:37:30.778 --> 02:37:34.200]  State Department is now supposed to step forward and say, U.S.
[02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:39.544]  citizens have been seized illegally in this country of Kenya, and we demand that they be freed.
[02:37:40.044 --> 02:37:42.466]  Let's stop right there, or we should have tourist protest.
[02:37:42.726 --> 02:37:46.248]  That's one of the safer countries in Africa and their main product.
[02:37:46.308 --> 02:37:48.530]  Not anymore, not since this revolution started.
[02:37:48.550 --> 02:37:49.951]  I was about to say, but let's stop right there.
[02:37:50.331 --> 02:37:51.112]  Give that number out.
[02:37:51.152 --> 02:37:51.932]  People, hold up a minute.
[02:37:51.972 --> 02:37:53.553]  I want to call them live on air.
[02:37:53.573 --> 02:37:55.454]  As long as we tell them they're live on air, that's fine.
[02:37:55.795 --> 02:37:56.855]  John, write this down.
[02:37:56.895 --> 02:37:57.496]  Write down the number.
[02:37:57.536 --> 02:37:58.096]  We're going to call them.
[02:37:58.116 --> 02:37:59.817]  Folks, hold off from calling so we can get through.
[02:38:00.718 --> 02:38:03.060]  John, get the Kenyan number right now from Webster.
[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:05.601]  I believe this is what I've written down off an email I got.
[02:38:05.621 --> 02:38:05.661]  202-387-6101.
[02:38:05.681 --> 02:38:06.282]  I think that's accurate.
[02:38:09.804 --> 02:38:15.149]  Say it again, say it again.
[02:38:15.169 --> 02:38:16.470]  202-387-6101.
[02:38:16.510 --> 02:38:20.634]  Hey John, I want you to dial that live on air where people can hear it.
[02:38:20.654 --> 02:38:23.717]  You can, we haven't done this in a while, but you can punch us up on air with the dialing, right?
[02:38:23.737 --> 02:38:26.820]  Alright, let's, as soon as you get it ringing.
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:27.701]  Great idea.
[02:38:27.841 --> 02:38:28.802]  Yeah, but keep going Webster.
[02:38:30.046 --> 02:38:31.287]  Anyway, look at this guy.
[02:38:31.327 --> 02:38:34.129]  He's got one son named after Raul Castro.
[02:38:34.530 --> 02:38:35.811]  That's fine.
[02:38:35.851 --> 02:38:36.772]  That's your cup of tea.
[02:38:36.812 --> 02:38:41.215]  But Winnie Mandela, this is a slightly more problematic choice.
[02:38:41.235 --> 02:38:42.416]  This is a vicious terrorist.
[02:38:42.836 --> 02:38:44.478]  Yeah, and a killer.
[02:38:44.538 --> 02:38:45.318]  I mean, she was somebody.
[02:38:45.338 --> 02:38:45.999]  She was someone.
[02:38:46.019 --> 02:38:47.860]  Mandela even had to divorce her on this.
[02:38:47.880 --> 02:38:49.622]  Had to dump her because of this stuff.
[02:38:49.882 --> 02:38:51.924]  The other thing I would add is Obama
[02:38:52.504 --> 02:38:58.969]  It's not widely known, but in terms of getting that monstrous bailout package passed last Friday... He bullied Congress.
[02:38:59.290 --> 02:39:06.215]  He was doing conference calls, in particular with the Congressional Black Caucus, which had voted overwhelmingly against it.
[02:39:06.855 --> 02:39:09.718]  Even though Obama said he was for it, they voted against it.
[02:39:10.138 --> 02:39:14.662]  He was on the phone, arm-twisting and cajoling and doing God knows what else.
[02:39:14.682 --> 02:39:17.564]  The New York Times reported he was instrumental in getting the final votes.
[02:39:18.024 --> 02:39:23.749]  And if you look at the evolution of this crisis, Obama was always 1,000% in favor of the bailout.
[02:39:23.789 --> 02:39:30.534]  McCain went through this moment of vacillation when he saw that there were 125 or 150 people... And you're saying that may lose him the election.
[02:39:30.574 --> 02:39:31.655]  He could have done something popular.
[02:39:32.759 --> 02:39:36.063]  Yeah, McCain obviously made the stupidest mistake of his life.
[02:39:36.103 --> 02:39:43.210]  He could have voted... McCain could have said, I can't stand this bill because of all the earmarks and pork barrel stuff that's in it.
[02:39:43.230 --> 02:39:47.956]  Because there's wooden arrows and all sorts of other silly things that have been put into it.
[02:39:47.996 --> 02:39:49.197]  He could have had a cover story.
[02:39:49.217 --> 02:39:51.139]  There's IRS secret police in it.
[02:39:51.399 --> 02:39:52.821]  There's carbon taxes in it.
[02:39:53.797 --> 02:39:53.997]  Right.
[02:39:54.057 --> 02:39:57.178]  So all sorts of good reasons for McCain to say no to it.
[02:39:57.658 --> 02:40:01.979]  But obviously, as you say, McCain is a very shaky proposition.
[02:40:02.419 --> 02:40:03.559]  I'm not arguing for McCain.
[02:40:03.579 --> 02:40:06.300]  What I'm arguing for is divided government.
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:11.321]  I do not want... Separation of powers, and you get that with McCain.
[02:40:11.341 --> 02:40:13.422]  John, how's it going with the call into the Kenyan embassy?
[02:40:16.042 --> 02:40:16.662]  Oh, is it ringing?
[02:40:17.423 --> 02:40:18.083]  Well, let me hear it.
[02:40:18.583 --> 02:40:20.043]  Let's hear the ringing on air, and then I'll talk to him.
[02:40:20.063 --> 02:40:21.344]  I'll tell him it's Genesis and we're live.
[02:40:22.624 --> 02:40:23.244]  Pipe it in, John.
[02:40:25.390 --> 02:40:29.513]  Here we go, calling the, uh, Kenyan Embassy in, uh, D.C.
[02:40:30.954 --> 02:40:31.415]  You're on air.
[02:40:31.435 --> 02:40:42.784]  I bet their phones are busy.
[02:40:48.288 --> 02:40:49.749]  Maybe they won't take any day off.
[02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:53.532]  Probably over at Laney getting their instructions.
[02:40:55.911 --> 02:40:58.216]  Alex, maybe somebody there can also look them up.
[02:40:58.937 --> 02:41:00.600]  Go to their webpage, I'm sure they have one.
[02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:02.163]  Yeah, John, you want to find an alternate number?
[02:41:04.286 --> 02:41:07.387]  I'll tell you what, get the State Department.
[02:41:08.368 --> 02:41:10.148]  What's the name of the section for U.S.
[02:41:10.208 --> 02:41:12.609]  citizens abroad in political trouble?
[02:41:13.170 --> 02:41:14.570]  What's the name of that desk?
[02:41:14.610 --> 02:41:19.032]  I would try the Africa desk of the State Department.
[02:41:19.112 --> 02:41:24.074]  Yeah, the Africa desk, but specifically... Africa desk, that'll be good enough.
[02:41:24.414 --> 02:41:26.775]  Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.
[02:41:26.835 --> 02:41:30.556]  John, call information, get the Africa desk for the U.S.
[02:41:30.596 --> 02:41:31.177]  State Department.
[02:41:31.197 --> 02:41:31.737]  Let's call them.
[02:41:32.665 --> 02:41:32.965]  Thank you.
[02:41:33.206 --> 02:41:33.746]  Africa does.
[02:41:33.806 --> 02:41:47.979]  This is absolutely outrageous, and I would really urge everybody to mobilize on this, because this is... If you can nail Obama on a couple of things like this, because it also leads right into the Filberg case, if he's a citizen, why won't he produce a birth certificate?
[02:41:48.639 --> 02:41:50.221]  We want to have the rule of law, right?
[02:41:50.281 --> 02:41:53.163]  Constitution is better than chaos and civil war.
[02:41:53.463 --> 02:41:55.065]  So let's respect the Constitution.
[02:41:55.885 --> 02:41:59.007]  And that means we want to see Obama's birth certificate.
[02:41:59.027 --> 02:42:02.329]  I would also point out, every state can do this.
[02:42:02.369 --> 02:42:05.311]  In other words, you can be in any state where Obama's on the ballot.
[02:42:05.751 --> 02:42:11.015]  You should go to Philberg's website, the obamacrimes.com.
[02:42:11.555 --> 02:42:13.916]  Get a copy of his submission.
[02:42:14.177 --> 02:42:16.738]  You can make the requisite changes in that.
[02:42:17.439 --> 02:42:20.861]  Give it to the Secretary of State of your state, or if you're a lawyer,
[02:42:21.687 --> 02:42:25.951]  And then contact the media that you've entered in to get local press.
[02:42:26.331 --> 02:42:30.174]  Right, because there are 50 or more, 51 with the D.C.
[02:42:30.314 --> 02:42:32.035]  and District of Columbia.
[02:42:32.215 --> 02:42:39.341]  There are at least 51 places where Obama can and should be sued to produce his birth certificate or be thrown off the ballot.
[02:42:39.361 --> 02:42:41.623]  That would be with the Secretary of State's office at each state.
[02:42:41.863 --> 02:42:42.624]  Yeah, depending.
[02:42:42.684 --> 02:42:46.187]  At most states, it's the Secretary of State, the guy who puts you on the ballot.
[02:42:46.347 --> 02:42:49.109]  And if you're a lawyer, or if you can get a lawyer,
[02:42:49.887 --> 02:42:55.170]  Take the Phil Byrd case as your starting point, make some requisite changes in that.
[02:42:55.230 --> 02:43:08.557]  And you're right, they love the fact that Bush wasn't elected, so they can always undermine him that way, and then put all the blame, and he's horrible, but he's just a puppet, and then set the precedent for constitutional crises, and get half the population, or the 20% of the
[02:43:11.038 --> 02:43:14.901]  of the population, roughly 25% that actually voted for him, to then support tyranny.
[02:43:15.201 --> 02:43:20.985]  Well now, if Obama's cheating the Constitution, we can now get 25-30% of the population to support that tyranny.
[02:43:21.225 --> 02:43:28.650]  This is also a seduction of the public to go... and that's how dictators and corrupt systems like to entice the public.
[02:43:29.570 --> 02:43:35.354]  I mean, Webster, you're a historian, so you understand the way tyrants seduce the public in a process.
[02:43:36.818 --> 02:43:41.781]  Yes, in the 20th century this typically was this question of the fascist mass movement.
[02:43:42.401 --> 02:43:47.724]  Remember though, with the color revolution cookbook, one of the things that most prominently you see now,
[02:43:48.607 --> 02:44:03.776]  One of the key ingredients of a people-power coup by the CIA and the intelligence agencies, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, Rosa's Revolution in Georgia that produced this tinpot Mussolini-Sakashvili, is fake polling.
[02:44:03.896 --> 02:44:05.978]  And we are now in the land of fake polling.
[02:44:06.158 --> 02:44:07.338]  All the polls are doctored.
[02:44:07.639 --> 02:44:08.619]  You mentioned a couple of them.
[02:44:08.639 --> 02:44:09.700]  There's a big divergence.
[02:44:10.581 --> 02:44:14.244]  Right now we have a Reuters Zogby poll that says Obama is ahead by 3.
[02:44:14.765 --> 02:44:17.647]  We have a Hotline tracking poll that Obama is ahead by 2.
[02:44:18.148 --> 02:44:20.971]  We have a CBS poll that Obama is ahead by 2.4.
[02:44:22.292 --> 02:44:29.159]  And then we have tracking polls from Gallup and Rasmussen that say something completely different, that Obama is ahead by 7, 8, or 9.
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:33.463]  I think we just have to say, all of these polls are inherently
[02:44:33.983 --> 02:44:38.746]  Unreliable, and may indeed be responding to the logic of the intelligence community.
[02:44:39.026 --> 02:44:42.368]  And the intelligence community, it should be obvious, supports Obama 1,000%.
[02:44:43.148 --> 02:44:48.251]  And the reason they want to do that is the question of the facelift for imperialism.
[02:44:48.491 --> 02:44:53.614]  Who can go into Europe and say, follow me in my assault on Russia?
[02:44:54.074 --> 02:44:54.954]  Obama can do this.
[02:44:55.034 --> 02:44:56.675]  McCain has no chance, whatever.
[02:44:56.976 --> 02:45:02.078]  Who can go into Africa and say, kick out the Chinese and join with us here in the United States?
[02:45:02.378 --> 02:45:03.259]  McCain can't do that.
[02:45:03.839 --> 02:45:06.202]  Republicans have beat their war drum.
[02:45:06.503 --> 02:45:12.229]  They've been discredited on lies on WMDs and Yellow Cake and Afghan heroin, opium.
[02:45:12.269 --> 02:45:15.213]  So now they need a fresh left cover, as you say.
[02:45:15.593 --> 02:45:20.379]  Yes, and the Hegelian element, most of the time people talk about the Hegelian dialectic.
[02:45:20.439 --> 02:45:23.202]  I don't think it's really the heart of the matter, but in this case it may well be.
[02:45:24.939 --> 02:45:28.322]  Obama is controlled by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[02:45:28.643 --> 02:45:31.786]  And then McCain's controlled foreign policy by his son.
[02:45:32.046 --> 02:45:34.869]  Right, but in terms of Hagel, let's follow the Hagel track back.
[02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:36.751]  Zbigniew Brzezinski
[02:45:37.449 --> 02:45:50.342]  Was a student and indeed a co-worker of a guy called Karl Friedrich, who comes out of Germany, and actually is an element, his professors were elements of a neo-Hegelian school.
[02:45:50.442 --> 02:45:52.844]  One of them in particular, Alfred Weber.
[02:45:53.165 --> 02:45:56.048]  If you've heard of Max Weber, his brother, Alfred Weber,
[02:45:59.691 --> 02:46:01.692]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:21.702]  Interlude of left-wing rules.
[02:46:21.802 --> 02:46:22.743]  To lead forward.
[02:46:22.763 --> 02:46:23.424]  To lead forward.
[02:46:23.684 --> 02:46:24.885]  The Carter administration.
[02:46:24.905 --> 02:46:27.688]  In other words, you've got to reverse your field from every now and then.
[02:46:27.988 --> 02:46:31.211]  You can't be Johnny OneNote and always repeating the same stuff.
[02:46:31.511 --> 02:46:35.816]  You can't go into the world today and say, War on Terror, Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:35.856 --> 02:46:37.397]  This is absolutely discredited.
[02:46:37.737 --> 02:46:38.318]  It's a joke.
[02:46:38.358 --> 02:46:39.299]  It's a laughingstock.
[02:46:39.359 --> 02:46:40.720]  Everybody in Europe hates you.
[02:46:41.041 --> 02:46:42.622]  The Africans will turn against you.
[02:46:42.842 --> 02:46:44.484]  You're isolated and you're bankrupt.
[02:46:44.864 --> 02:46:49.406]  So the genius of Brzezinski is to say, but now he's a smiling liberal face.
[02:46:49.726 --> 02:46:51.827]  Yeah, a left liberal face.
[02:46:52.127 --> 02:46:56.869]  Let's give them human rights, humanitarian concerns, and above all, dignity.
[02:46:57.149 --> 02:47:00.730]  And dignity means that you get a mini-state or a micro-state
[02:47:01.090 --> 02:47:02.951]  That corresponds exactly to you.
[02:47:03.031 --> 02:47:19.279]  I mean, it would also imply the breakup of the United States before too long, because the idea is that whatever your ethnic, religious, and other peculiarities may be, you should have an identity politics, mini-state or micro-state, that corresponds exactly to those.
[02:47:19.299 --> 02:47:20.220]  For example, the Luros.
[02:47:20.620 --> 02:47:28.224]  With the Luros, you can destabilize Kenya, Tanzania, the Congo, along with Uganda,
[02:47:29.122 --> 02:47:31.924]  And parts of other surrounding countries.
[02:47:31.944 --> 02:47:33.325]  You get up to about five countries.
[02:47:33.686 --> 02:47:39.810]  If you're going to have a Lua state under Odinga, that essentially carves you five of the African countries.
[02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:46.015]  And then you can begin kicking the Chinese out of all of those places and pursue your imperialist agenda.
[02:47:46.055 --> 02:47:51.358]  So it does go back to the Hegelianism of Alfred Weber and then this Carl Friedrich.
[02:47:51.418 --> 02:47:51.979]  Carl Friedrich
[02:47:52.379 --> 02:47:53.260]  I think so.
[02:48:09.506 --> 02:48:14.069]  Maybe you don't get involved, and Brzezinski would say, we don't, we want to use others.
[02:48:14.449 --> 02:48:15.890]  We want to use... He used proxies!
[02:48:16.310 --> 02:48:16.930]  Yeah, proxies.
[02:48:16.970 --> 02:48:18.691]  Let's use them as kamikaze puppets.
[02:48:18.751 --> 02:48:20.612]  Above all, let's use Iran.
[02:48:20.892 --> 02:48:22.794]  Why attack Iran to destroy Iran?
[02:48:23.074 --> 02:48:26.075]  Why not get Iran to attack Russia and destroy both?
[02:48:26.115 --> 02:48:28.677]  And if you don't believe it, look at what they did with Georgia.
[02:48:28.737 --> 02:48:32.059]  If there was ever a hopeless military... By the way, I wanted you to comment on that.
[02:48:32.159 --> 02:48:35.881]  Now NATO and the US has blamed their puppet.
[02:48:36.601 --> 02:48:39.604]  I think that it may be a little bit more complicated.
[02:48:39.624 --> 02:48:44.309]  I suspect that people in the Bush State Department might have told them, don't do it, you're going to get overwhelmed.
[02:49:01.932 --> 02:49:06.215]  But I think Brzezinski and Soros do their own direct channels, back channels, if you like.
[02:49:06.256 --> 02:49:07.697]  We're telling them, go ahead and do it.
[02:49:07.737 --> 02:49:08.758]  Let's get the crisis going.
[02:49:08.778 --> 02:49:10.019]  And they're setting him up.
[02:49:10.339 --> 02:49:18.705]  They don't care if he loses, knowing he would, because they want to set the stage for the big, bad Russia and try to get Europe to line up against Russia and let new weapon systems be rolled in.
[02:49:18.946 --> 02:49:19.426]  Exactly.
[02:49:19.466 --> 02:49:22.008]  And he's the Shah of Iran, if you like.
[02:49:22.048 --> 02:49:23.729]  He was their puppet.
[02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.630]  They put him in.
[02:49:24.970 --> 02:49:26.272]  But he's also expendable.
[02:49:26.612 --> 02:49:29.074]  And he's expendable as the leading edge of getting
[02:49:29.634 --> 02:49:33.937]  Larger puppets, Ukraine, Poland, and then the three Baltics, right?
[02:49:34.017 --> 02:49:35.398]  Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia.
[02:49:35.418 --> 02:49:39.101]  But now Ukraine's pulling out, Poland doesn't want to go along.
[02:49:39.981 --> 02:49:42.923]  I mean, they know that Russia just wants to do business.
[02:49:43.243 --> 02:49:44.765]  They want to have a good economy.
[02:49:45.045 --> 02:49:46.145]  So can you comment on that?
[02:49:46.185 --> 02:49:50.588]  We now see Eastern Europe and some of these puppet states breaking away from the West.
[02:49:50.689 --> 02:49:52.570]  And in Parliament, we see things breaking down.
[02:49:53.334 --> 02:49:59.779]  I think that it proves that Brzezinski's methods, ultimately, desperate as they are, generally don't work.
[02:49:59.799 --> 02:50:03.422]  Because we have blowback with the overall NATO-US system being discredited.
[02:50:04.043 --> 02:50:06.765]  Yes, and Ukraine is a very specific case.
[02:50:06.965 --> 02:50:10.608]  You have Yushchenko, who's here in the United States now, or wasn't until yesterday.
[02:50:11.272 --> 02:50:16.296]  Yushchenko is a straight U.S.-British International Monetary Fund NATO agent.
[02:50:16.676 --> 02:50:19.439]  And he's the pro-Western side in Kiev.
[02:50:19.799 --> 02:50:25.784]  But, interestingly enough, we have Yulia Tymoshenko, the former gas princess, right?
[02:50:25.824 --> 02:50:27.485]  The blonde lady with the braids.
[02:50:27.845 --> 02:50:28.546]  You may have seen her.
[02:50:29.406 --> 02:50:29.766]  Pardon me?
[02:50:29.946 --> 02:50:30.786]  Looks like Princess Leia.
[02:50:30.806 --> 02:50:32.567]  Yeah, they've been other snowmaidens.
[02:50:32.707 --> 02:50:34.427]  Nikolochka, I think they call her.
[02:50:35.408 --> 02:50:40.589]  So she is now the neutral, or indeed pro-Russian side of Ukraine.
[02:50:40.629 --> 02:50:47.771]  So that government is falling, and therefore the puppet regime that Soros and Brzezinski had put up in Ukraine is now in great trouble.
[02:50:47.831 --> 02:50:51.952]  So the point is that Putin is the new Cardinal Brzezinski.
[02:50:51.992 --> 02:50:57.414]  He's infinitely better in terms of geopolitics than any of these amateurs around Brzezinski.
[02:50:57.574 --> 02:50:58.595]  Webster, stay there.
[02:50:58.655 --> 02:51:00.696]  Let's look into the future on the economic front.
[02:51:02.277 --> 02:51:02.957]  Question.
[02:51:03.117 --> 02:51:06.519]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[02:51:07.780 --> 02:51:12.263]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[02:51:12.343 --> 02:51:12.883]  Question.
[02:51:13.183 --> 02:51:16.765]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[02:51:18.446 --> 02:51:19.027]  Question.
[02:51:19.227 --> 02:51:22.789]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[02:52:01.836 --> 02:52:08.218]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:52:08.598 --> 02:52:10.559]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:11.239 --> 02:52:12.339]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:12.779 --> 02:52:13.300]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:13.560 --> 02:52:14.500]  This is his MO.
[02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:15.940]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:15.960 --> 02:52:17.641]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:52:17.941 --> 02:52:24.663]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:52:25.083 --> 02:52:25.523]  Some U.S.
[02:52:25.563 --> 02:52:31.348]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:52:31.928 --> 02:52:35.411]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:52:35.431 --> 02:52:45.679]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:52:45.899 --> 02:52:46.660]  Fabled enemies.

[02:53:05.973 --> 02:53:07.393]  The stock market is crazy.
[02:53:07.834 --> 02:53:10.154]  The chemtrails are spraying us with their chemicals.
[02:53:10.794 --> 02:53:12.555]  It's time to think about what is important.
[02:53:13.095 --> 02:53:15.316]  Most forget just how important life is.
[02:53:16.016 --> 02:53:22.538]  Life Change Tea removes toxins, chemicals, parasites, and bacteria that store up in your body.

[02:53:31.581 --> 02:53:32.281]  You lose weight!
[02:53:32.581 --> 02:53:36.384]  And on top of that, there's a 45-day money-back guarantee.
[02:53:36.804 --> 02:53:37.485]  So why wait?
[02:53:37.825 --> 02:53:38.325]  Call now.
[02:53:38.445 --> 02:53:40.847]  Operators are standing by.
[02:53:40.867 --> 02:53:41.607]  928-308-0408.
[02:53:41.787 --> 02:53:46.931]  I'll say it again.
[02:53:46.951 --> 02:53:47.611]  928-308-0408.
[02:53:47.771 --> 02:53:52.355]  Or order online at GetTheTee.com.
[02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:54.476]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[02:53:54.516 --> 02:53:58.579]  Now remember, the stock market may crash, but you don't have to go with it.
[02:54:02.694 --> 02:54:09.557]  Okay, we're dialing the African desk at the State Department in Washington, D.C.
[02:54:12.418 --> 02:54:15.599]  John just talked to him and they said, oh no, Mr. Corsi's not being held anywhere.
[02:54:15.619 --> 02:54:17.160]  He's very happy having a nice vacation.
[02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:19.381]  Uh, ma'am?
[02:54:20.721 --> 02:54:21.261]  Hello, ma'am?
[02:54:22.642 --> 02:54:22.922]  Hello?
[02:54:23.982 --> 02:54:25.003]  Hello, this is Alex Jones.
[02:54:25.023 --> 02:54:25.443]  Who's there?
[02:54:28.084 --> 02:54:28.564]  They hung up.
[02:54:28.604 --> 02:54:29.845]  Call back right now, on air.
[02:54:29.925 --> 02:54:30.705]  I just want to talk to them.
[02:54:31.775 --> 02:54:33.196]  Okay, we just called him there in the break.
[02:54:33.216 --> 02:54:35.017]  They said he's happy and he's not in jail.
[02:54:35.057 --> 02:54:35.597]  Nothing happened.
[02:54:35.998 --> 02:54:39.260]  AP is reporting that he is on house arrest.
[02:54:40.340 --> 02:54:41.781]  The Times of London is reporting it.
[02:54:43.362 --> 02:54:44.383]  I have the AP here.
[02:54:44.663 --> 02:54:51.107]  Carlos Maltooth, a senior immigration official in charge of investigators, said Dr. Corsi did not have a work permit.
[02:54:51.127 --> 02:54:52.448]  We still haven't decided what to do with him.
[02:54:52.768 --> 02:54:53.849]  He told the Associated Press.
[02:54:54.609 --> 02:54:55.730]  So we're calling the embassy.
[02:54:56.900 --> 02:54:58.862]  Well, the State Department to ask what the U.S.
[02:54:58.902 --> 02:55:01.745]  Embassy is doing about this over in Kenya.
[02:55:04.669 --> 02:55:05.690]  John, you got the phone ringing yet?
[02:55:07.652 --> 02:55:08.773]  I don't mind hearing the recording.
[02:55:08.954 --> 02:55:09.254]  Here we go.
[02:55:29.773 --> 02:55:30.993]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:55:33.034 --> 02:55:44.837]  Probably have our number in their caller ID.
[02:55:50.079 --> 02:55:51.559]  Now the State Department's not answering.
[02:55:55.360 --> 02:55:57.161]  John, you said they were answering right away before, right?
[02:56:03.626 --> 02:56:04.386]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:56:04.426 --> 02:56:06.627]  As soon as they heard me talking, they could tell what it was and hung up.
[02:56:07.227 --> 02:56:08.327]  Or I could declare myself to them.
[02:56:10.107 --> 02:56:11.127]  Yeah, I'll call back again.
[02:56:11.147 --> 02:56:18.129]  This is very interesting, isn't it, Webster Tarbley, to call them up and they say, we don't know what you're talking about.
[02:56:18.149 --> 02:56:20.509]  Remember, of course, he's quite happy right now.
[02:56:20.969 --> 02:56:25.110]  Remember that power in Washington is no longer in the hands of Bush Cheney, whatever that was.
[02:56:25.290 --> 02:56:29.611]  It's now Condoleezza Rice, Bob Gates, a Brzezinski man.
[02:56:30.331 --> 02:56:37.133]  Obama has signaled that Bob Gates will stay on at the Pentagon as a Brzezinski insider.
[02:56:37.213 --> 02:56:40.154]  And by the way, he was at the Bilderberg meeting earlier this year in Chantilly.
[02:56:40.474 --> 02:56:40.975]  Gates was.
[02:56:41.315 --> 02:56:43.856]  Yeah, he was Brzezinski's office boy.
[02:56:43.876 --> 02:56:44.176]  It's ringing.
[02:56:44.216 --> 02:56:44.576]  It's ringing.
[02:56:44.936 --> 02:56:45.256]  It's ringing.
[02:56:45.276 --> 02:56:46.836]  Hold on.
[02:56:46.857 --> 02:56:47.897]  Brzezinski's office boy.
[02:56:48.277 --> 02:56:49.177]  Here we go.
[02:56:50.998 --> 02:56:51.758]  CIA director.
[02:56:51.778 --> 02:56:57.280]  This is ridiculous.
[02:57:04.619 --> 02:57:06.100]  Hello?
[02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:07.280]  John?
[02:57:07.300 --> 02:57:10.662]  Are you on air right now with me?
[02:57:11.802 --> 02:57:12.362]  Get on air with me.
[02:57:12.803 --> 02:57:14.063]  I'm on air.
[02:57:15.364 --> 02:57:17.104]  John, I want you to use a back line.
[02:57:17.124 --> 02:57:18.965]  They've obviously got caller ID.
[02:57:19.506 --> 02:57:21.787]  Okay, I'm going to call off my studio extension.
[02:57:22.027 --> 02:57:23.107]  Yeah, call on a back line.
[02:57:23.127 --> 02:57:24.968]  We're going to keep trying this web show.
[02:57:24.988 --> 02:57:25.908]  We'll hold you over to finish up.
[02:57:25.928 --> 02:57:29.370]  What were you saying just now about the Minion gates?
[02:57:30.146 --> 02:57:45.653]  Well, we have the Principals Committee, it's the Committee of Public Safety, so it's Gates, the Brzezinski veteran, we've got Rice, the people of Corbell, Albright, and you've got, of course, Paulson, who's running the government, clearly enough, from Goldman Sachs, and Admiral Mullen.
[02:57:45.893 --> 02:57:47.994]  That's what runs Washington, not Bush-Cheney.
[02:57:48.014 --> 02:57:50.875]  Well, you're right, and now they've taken our Goldman Sachs Vice President.
[02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:55.612]  Under the former Goldman Sachs head who's running it all to hand out the 700 plus million.
[02:57:56.072 --> 02:58:10.197]  And remember that Goldman Sachs is the main, the single greatest contributor to Obama, and Goldman Sachs is beating, Obama's beating McCain, I think, 5 or 6 to 1 in the Goldman Sachs bundling category.
[02:58:10.217 --> 02:58:10.978]  So it's bundled.
[02:58:10.998 --> 02:58:11.918]  They've given close to $500,000 to him.
[02:58:14.682 --> 02:58:15.403]  Something like that.
[02:58:15.643 --> 02:58:18.065]  So, you're going to get a Goldman Sachs dictatorship.
[02:58:18.546 --> 02:58:20.467]  Remember that Pelosi is run by Soros.
[02:58:20.608 --> 02:58:22.209]  You don't want to have a one-party state.
[02:58:22.229 --> 02:58:24.131]  You want divided government and gridlock.
[02:58:25.592 --> 02:58:26.813]  When you have a tyranny, certainly.
[02:58:27.254 --> 02:58:31.237]  And not having gridlock and separation of powers always gives you tyranny.
[02:58:31.638 --> 02:58:32.839]  Webster, one minute break.
[02:58:32.879 --> 02:58:33.700]  Come back with five minutes.
[02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:34.440]  Let you wrap up.
[02:58:34.861 --> 02:58:36.822]  Later in the show, I'm going to try to call again.
[02:58:37.163 --> 02:58:37.883]  We'll see what happens.
[02:58:37.903 --> 02:58:38.264]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.268 --> 02:58:46.631]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.755 --> 02:58:53.496]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[02:58:53.776 --> 02:58:57.219]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:57.239 --> 02:58:59.201]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:59.841 --> 02:59:02.563]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:59:02.883 --> 02:59:08.348]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:59:08.608 --> 02:59:12.531]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[02:59:18.053 --> 02:59:20.814]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:59:36.041 --> 02:59:38.582]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:59:38.923 --> 02:59:40.564]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:59:40.984 --> 02:59:42.745]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:59:42.965 --> 02:59:44.786]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:59:45.106 --> 02:59:46.507]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:59:46.887 --> 02:59:48.268]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:59:51.430 --> 02:59:53.331]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:53.811 --> 02:59:56.593]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:01.903 --> 03:00:06.207]  We have talked to Chris Emory, a great Oklahoma City investigator, a talk show host in his own right.
[03:00:06.667 --> 03:00:07.828]  Got the same info we got.
[03:00:07.868 --> 03:00:08.429]  You call the U.S.
[03:00:08.509 --> 03:00:11.992]  Embassy and they say Corsi was not currently in custody.
[03:00:12.052 --> 03:00:14.454]  And further, they refused to give their name as a spokesman.
[03:00:15.275 --> 03:00:18.638]  They said that Corsi was well and enjoying his vacation in Kenya.
[03:00:20.820 --> 03:00:27.486]  So, because they're not answering the phone, clearly with caller ID, with us calling, we're going to give out the number to the U.S.
[03:00:27.646 --> 03:00:28.287]  State Department.
[03:00:29.185 --> 03:00:38.971]  In Washington, D.C., ask for the African desk, ask for others, and you tell them that we don't appreciate that puppet government arresting investigative journalists or detaining them.
[03:00:39.171 --> 03:00:40.552]  John Harmon, let's bring John up.
[03:00:40.592 --> 03:00:41.373]  John, give them the number.
[03:00:42.285 --> 03:00:43.106]  The number is 2-0-2-5-7-2-5-1-6-0.
[03:00:43.126 --> 03:00:44.447]  One more time.
[03:00:44.467 --> 03:00:44.968]  2-0-2-5-7-2-5-1-6-0.
[03:00:45.108 --> 03:00:50.854]  Alright, Richard C. Cook's coming up over his perspective on the economy and what's happening.
[03:00:50.874 --> 03:00:51.315]  And, um...
[03:01:04.716 --> 03:01:06.057]  Going back to Webster Tarpley.
[03:01:06.277 --> 03:01:08.619]  Webster, I really appreciate you spending time with us.
[03:01:08.659 --> 03:01:12.181]  Spend four minutes of the time we have left on where you see the economy going.
[03:01:12.221 --> 03:01:15.683]  They got their Banker Empowerment Bill, which is not a bailout of Wall Street.
[03:01:15.703 --> 03:01:17.164]  We're going to have socialism.
[03:01:17.184 --> 03:01:18.345]  Might as well be to the people.
[03:01:18.925 --> 03:01:20.647]  We should have direct cash payments to the people.
[03:01:21.267 --> 03:01:24.109]  Instead, they're going to seize whatever they want, do whatever they want.
[03:01:25.736 --> 03:01:29.239]  Immunity, a Goldman Sachs dictatorship, good way of putting it, that's what it is.
[03:01:29.659 --> 03:01:31.661]  We're not exaggerating there.
[03:01:32.241 --> 03:01:38.046]  Where you see this going now is the market is in free fall, down over a thousand points in the last week.
[03:01:38.829 --> 03:01:43.294]  Well, the first thing about the bailout, of course, is that it's futile, and there are two things that have to be done.
[03:01:43.774 --> 03:01:45.276]  This is a derivatives crisis.
[03:01:45.576 --> 03:01:47.058]  It's now beginning to filter through.
[03:01:47.498 --> 03:01:50.462]  What is in crisis is not mortgages to poor people.
[03:01:50.522 --> 03:01:51.483]  This is ridiculous.
[03:01:51.983 --> 03:01:52.924]  It is derivatives.
[03:01:53.185 --> 03:01:54.906]  1.5 quadrillion of derivatives.
[03:01:54.946 --> 03:01:57.069]  That includes mortgage-backed securities,
[03:01:57.569 --> 03:02:05.736]  Collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, structured investment vehicles, structured notes of all sorts, over-the-counter derivatives.
[03:02:06.097 --> 03:02:12.082]  The only thing to be done with those derivatives is to wipe them out, to expunge them, to freeze them, to destroy them.
[03:02:12.482 --> 03:02:14.384]  You can freeze them if you want to, that's fine.
[03:02:14.424 --> 03:02:20.629]  Freeze them for the duration of the crisis, say a 10-year freeze on all derivatives and indeed all financial debt.
[03:02:20.649 --> 03:02:24.092]  You have to do that or it will continue to infect what's left of the real economy.
[03:02:24.512 --> 03:02:25.553]  Because it's a black hole.
[03:02:25.593 --> 03:02:30.997]  It's a 1.5 quadrillion dollar black hole which is going to eat this piddling sum.
[03:02:31.057 --> 03:02:34.520]  It's enough to bankrupt the United States, but not enough to save the derivatives.
[03:02:34.961 --> 03:02:36.802]  So you've got to destroy these derivatives.
[03:02:36.862 --> 03:02:40.745]  Delete them, shred them, bonfire the derivatives, call it whatever you want.
[03:02:41.025 --> 03:02:42.386]  They've got to be destroyed.
[03:02:42.426 --> 03:02:44.208]  They've got to be put out of action.
[03:02:44.248 --> 03:02:48.011]  Because it's a Ponzi fraud that attached itself to the real economy criminally.
[03:02:48.271 --> 03:02:52.153]  Now, the other thing is, I've written a paper about the Main Street Lending Facility.
[03:02:52.213 --> 03:03:00.936]  By my calculation, the Federal Reserve now has $1.5 trillion of special, cheap federal credit to parasites.
[03:03:01.056 --> 03:03:06.278]  To banks, investment banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, money markets.
[03:03:06.938 --> 03:03:09.420]  Uh, brokerage houses and all sorts of other people.
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:15.104]  The line that they used to try to defend was the Federal Reserve will only help its own member banks is gone.
[03:03:15.445 --> 03:03:19.768]  So why not agitate now for a partial nationalization of the Fed?
[03:03:19.808 --> 03:03:22.250]  Let's do it step by step and get things going.
[03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:23.871]  Let's open up a window.
[03:03:24.031 --> 03:03:25.693]  Force the Fed to open a window.
[03:03:26.173 --> 03:03:27.294]  One trillion dollars
[03:03:27.954 --> 03:03:34.458]  Of cheap credit between 1.5% and 1% for producers, that is to say, for the Detroit automakers.
[03:03:34.478 --> 03:03:36.719]  And that would rebuild the real economy.
[03:03:37.060 --> 03:03:38.761]  Yes, you'd be creating actual jobs.
[03:03:39.001 --> 03:03:42.603]  Why is it that parasites get all the cheap credit from the producers?
[03:03:42.623 --> 03:03:44.504]  Why is it that criminals and engineers get it all?
[03:03:44.724 --> 03:03:46.105]  And producers don't get any.
[03:03:46.165 --> 03:03:47.166]  In other words, the rest of us.
[03:03:47.226 --> 03:03:51.068]  And I'm talking dry cleaners, restaurants, auto repair shops.
[03:03:51.588 --> 03:03:54.152]  Small and medium industry, all the way up to Detroit.
[03:03:54.172 --> 03:03:55.754]  Detroit is on the verge of collapse.
[03:03:55.814 --> 03:04:00.541]  Light bulb factories, the clothing production.
[03:04:00.581 --> 03:04:01.042]  Farmers!
[03:04:01.302 --> 03:04:02.744]  Farmers need cheap credit.
[03:04:02.924 --> 03:04:07.671]  We've got to have cheap credit for all kinds of farmers, all kinds of agricultural industries.
[03:04:08.091 --> 03:04:15.057]  I mean, I'm not for all this socialism, but if they're going to just hand trillions to private bankers that goes offshore, why not just give it to farmers?
[03:04:15.177 --> 03:04:16.718]  And again, it's not socialism at all.
[03:04:16.738 --> 03:04:21.722]  This is the American system of Alexander Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
[03:04:21.942 --> 03:04:31.230]  This is the essence of the American system of political economy, and it's only because of the Milton Friedman agitation and the Von Hayek agitation of the past.
[03:04:31.810 --> 03:04:34.852]  We're out of time.
[03:04:34.892 --> 03:04:39.675]  Folks, you can get your book at InfoWars.com.
[03:04:40.115 --> 03:04:41.556]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[03:04:41.576 --> 03:04:42.176]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:42.196 --> 03:04:45.138]  Please keep going on Corsi, because he needs help.
[03:04:45.838 --> 03:04:47.559]  Yeah, fire out your own personal website.
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:55.764]  The best way to get my stuff is Amazon.com, but if you want to see my Bush book, for example, it's up for free at Tarpley.net.
[03:04:55.904 --> 03:04:56.944]  Alright, thanks, Webster.
[03:04:58.903 --> 03:05:05.309]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:05:05.650 --> 03:05:07.631]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:05:08.312 --> 03:05:09.373]  But who is the enemy?
[03:05:09.853 --> 03:05:10.394]  Bin Laden.
[03:05:10.634 --> 03:05:11.475]  This is his ammo.
[03:05:11.515 --> 03:05:13.016]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:05:13.037 --> 03:05:14.718]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:05:14.998 --> 03:05:21.745]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:05:22.145 --> 03:05:22.585]  Some U.S.
[03:05:22.625 --> 03:05:28.430]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:05:28.990 --> 03:05:32.472]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:05:32.492 --> 03:05:42.720]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:05:42.960 --> 03:05:43.720]  Fabled Enemies.
[03:05:44.201 --> 03:05:50.805]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:05:53.942 --> 03:05:55.383]  Or you are with the terrorists!
[03:05:58.665 --> 03:06:01.707]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[03:06:02.087 --> 03:06:04.149]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[03:06:04.409 --> 03:06:07.411]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[03:06:07.711 --> 03:06:10.273]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[03:06:10.513 --> 03:06:14.175]  Finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[03:06:14.575 --> 03:06:16.697]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[03:06:17.197 --> 03:06:20.259]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[03:06:20.479 --> 03:06:25.122]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[03:06:25.262 --> 03:06:28.984]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[03:06:29.204 --> 03:06:30.745]  Travel less, meet online.
[03:06:30.845 --> 03:06:33.327]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.

[03:06:39.431 --> 03:06:39.991]  Remember that code?
[03:06:40.051 --> 03:06:40.351]  We're good.
[03:06:58.530 --> 03:07:06.934]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[03:07:07.234 --> 03:07:12.917]  At HempUSA.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[03:07:13.218 --> 03:07:19.821]  At HempUSA.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[03:07:20.341 --> 03:07:23.623]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[03:07:23.723 --> 03:07:25.964]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[03:07:26.164 --> 03:07:32.528]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced affordably to be used as a storable food.
[03:07:32.748 --> 03:07:36.070]  HempUSA.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.

[03:07:59.867 --> 03:08:05.411]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.875 --> 03:08:18.375]  We're good to go.
[03:08:40.094 --> 03:08:40.914]  Being set up.
[03:08:40.934 --> 03:08:46.636]  But before we go to our guest, in a few minutes I also want to give you some of the numbers.
[03:08:47.197 --> 03:08:49.037]  Well, right now the Dow drops below 9,700.
[03:08:49.217 --> 03:08:52.699]  It's down 327 points today.
[03:08:52.719 --> 03:08:54.459]  It was down about 400 points yesterday.
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.060]  Last week, as you know, it dropped about 600 points.
[03:08:57.601 --> 03:08:59.781]  That's over a thousand point drop in a week.
[03:09:00.702 --> 03:09:03.543]  And that's after the bankers were given dictatorial power.
[03:09:03.863 --> 03:09:09.465]  So they are definitely consolidating and we'll get his unique analysis on that coming up in a moment.
[03:09:10.405 --> 03:09:13.828]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about New Vitality, a wonderful sponsor.
[03:09:13.848 --> 03:09:22.677]  They have hundreds of great vitamins and minerals and different nutrient products that don't have magical claims.
[03:09:23.337 --> 03:09:24.438]  They don't have miracle claims.
[03:09:24.459 --> 03:09:34.248]  They're just high-quality things that are known to be really good for you, like concentrated aloe vera with 29 other ingredients in their aloe-ease body cleanse that flushes out the guts and detoxifies
[03:09:35.575 --> 03:09:50.155]  So important, toll free number to call them, 1-800-569-4056, but link through to the banner on InfoWars.com, NewVitality.com, if you forget the name of the website you can find a banner on InfoWars.com and check out their hundreds of great products.
[03:09:50.695 --> 03:09:51.955]  Alloys, colon, and body cleanse.
[03:09:51.975 --> 03:09:53.276]  They also have a super beta prostate.
[03:09:53.296 --> 03:09:55.536]  Men over 45 should really all be taking this.
[03:09:55.556 --> 03:09:57.716]  This is even what mainline doctors are prescribing.
[03:09:58.536 --> 03:10:04.678]  And it's concentrated salt palm meadow and other herbs and things that are known to really help the health of the prostate.
[03:10:04.698 --> 03:10:05.598]  Super beta prostate.
[03:10:05.618 --> 03:10:05.998]  1-800-569-4056.
[03:10:06.018 --> 03:10:07.238]  Again, or you can also go to newvitality.com.
[03:10:07.258 --> 03:10:07.338]  1-800-569-4056.
[03:10:07.378 --> 03:10:08.078]  Great folks.
[03:10:18.926 --> 03:10:22.129]  Another wonderful sponsor is Okolo Blue.
[03:10:22.849 --> 03:10:28.534]  Okolo Blue is a sponsor that we're really proud to have.
[03:10:29.074 --> 03:10:30.395]  We have it right here in our office.
[03:10:31.015 --> 03:10:35.359]  It gets 7.5 gallons a day in average humidity in the lowest humidity in the desert.
[03:10:35.799 --> 03:10:40.403]  It's about three gallons or a little bit more than three gallons, a half of 7.5 a day.
[03:10:41.123 --> 03:10:42.905]  It's an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[03:10:42.945 --> 03:10:44.986]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:10:45.026 --> 03:10:46.427]  Pure clean water without the fluoride.
[03:10:46.808 --> 03:10:48.329]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:52.762]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way Mother Nature makes it.
[03:10:53.123 --> 03:10:54.644]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:10:54.784 --> 03:10:55.804]  Neutral pH.
[03:10:56.505 --> 03:10:58.726]  And how does the filtration process work?
[03:10:58.746 --> 03:11:00.087]  The water is grabbed out of the air.
[03:11:00.147 --> 03:11:00.888]  It's naturally there.
[03:11:01.268 --> 03:11:03.930]  Then it passes through an activated carbon filter.
[03:11:03.970 --> 03:11:05.571]  Then a silver impregnated carbon filter.
[03:11:05.811 --> 03:11:07.392]  Then a reverse osmosis system.
[03:11:08.193 --> 03:11:11.175]  And that's... reverse osmosis gets out 99% of the stuff by itself.
[03:11:11.615 --> 03:11:13.196]  Then a taste and odor removal filter.
[03:11:13.236 --> 03:11:16.919]  And it's stored in a tank, illuminated by an antibacterial fungal UV light.
[03:11:17.535 --> 03:11:19.437]  Comes in red, black, white, green, silver, and blue.
[03:11:19.477 --> 03:11:21.699]  You can plug a solar panel into it or right into the wall.
[03:11:22.039 --> 03:11:23.461]  Okoloblue.com.
[03:11:23.581 --> 03:11:25.903]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[03:11:25.963 --> 03:11:29.947]  Okoloblue.com or 866-585-4044.
[03:11:30.407 --> 03:11:35.052]  And you can see banners up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com over to Okoloblue.
[03:11:35.472 --> 03:11:39.536]  If you forget the website, you can also call and get a free brochure or order one today.
[03:11:39.556 --> 03:11:39.596]  866-585-4044.
[03:11:39.616 --> 03:11:39.836]  Okoloblue.
[03:11:43.374 --> 03:11:43.734]  All right.
[03:11:44.295 --> 03:11:46.236]  And it is the sponsors that make this show possible.
[03:11:46.536 --> 03:11:50.578]  Plus, I only seek out sponsors I believe in and I think are cool and affordable.
[03:11:51.319 --> 03:11:59.123]  Okay, Richard C. Cook needs no introduction, but I will introduce him with the fact that the stock market is down, as he predicted years ago, to $9,628 and plunging as we speak.
[03:12:02.948 --> 03:12:03.468]  I don't
[03:12:26.428 --> 03:12:29.331]  The Fed's talking about a big rate cut that will further implode the dollar.
[03:12:29.652 --> 03:12:31.333]  Gold is exploding in prices today.
[03:12:31.774 --> 03:12:34.677]  Richard C. Cook, break down what we're facing, sir.
[03:12:35.678 --> 03:12:41.924]  Well, I think what we need to understand is that this is not really a financial crisis.
[03:12:43.246 --> 03:12:47.871]  That's what everybody portrays it as, but that is not really the case.
[03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:58.913]  What we have is a production crisis because it's the world economy, the producing economy, that is actually collapsing.
[03:13:01.013 --> 03:13:02.515]  The financial wizards
[03:13:19.116 --> 03:13:19.677]  That is correct.
[03:13:19.697 --> 03:13:21.378]  And the stock market, it's not really a mystery.
[03:13:21.498 --> 03:13:25.361]  And as you say, some of us saw this coming a long time ago.
[03:13:39.032 --> 03:13:52.232]  I started writing about this well over a year ago, and I was estimating at that time that the stock market could come down in half from its high of $14,000, because what it's doing is it's really going to its natural level.
[03:13:52.904 --> 03:13:57.447]  The stock market has been artificially inflated by all the financial bubbles.
[03:13:58.047 --> 03:14:10.735]  Now that those financial bubbles have burst, it's going back to its natural level, which is the level that the producing and consumer economy can sustain without excessive debt.
[03:14:11.593 --> 03:14:22.881]  That's what is going on and the real indicator here that nobody pays any attention to because they don't want us to pay attention to it is consumer purchasing power.
[03:14:23.522 --> 03:14:28.645]  It's what consumers are comfortably able to buy with what they earn.
[03:14:29.306 --> 03:14:33.789]  Now consumers over you know really going back 20-25 years
[03:14:35.570 --> 03:14:41.834]  Have been buying way more than what they can afford because of the easy credit that's been available.
[03:14:42.434 --> 03:14:47.276]  This is why the economy is 70 trillion dollars in debt.
[03:14:47.957 --> 03:14:53.980]  Because consumers have only been able to keep up their standard of living by more and more borrowing.
[03:14:54.420 --> 03:15:01.224]  Now that they can't borrow anymore because people won't lend to them because it's so obvious they can't repay their loans.
[03:15:01.844 --> 03:15:04.706]  Consumer purchasing power in the United States
[03:15:05.618 --> 03:15:05.838]  Yes, we are.
[03:15:26.341 --> 03:15:32.486]  Tens of billions of dollars in additional bond issues in order to pay for all of these bailouts.
[03:15:32.966 --> 03:15:39.391]  And, of course, Treasury bonds are earning such a low level of interest that it's really negative savings.
[03:15:39.431 --> 03:15:46.036]  You lose money when you buy Treasury bonds these days, but you have to because you lose even more in the stock market.
[03:15:46.617 --> 03:15:55.584]  So we're seeing a shift into the Treasury bond market that is going to be used to generate more borrowed cash by the government this time
[03:15:56.224 --> 03:16:05.072]  In order to pay off all of these bailouts to the rich financiers who have just carried out the biggest heist in history.
[03:16:07.875 --> 03:16:08.996]  Continue, continue.
[03:16:10.017 --> 03:16:20.787]  Well, what we're seeing in all of the markets is not the collapse of the capital markets.
[03:16:22.221 --> 03:16:29.903]  Because the capital that's available for all of these investments is only a very tiny proportion of what has actually gone into the bubbles.
[03:16:31.043 --> 03:16:39.926]  The real source of the bubble financing has been bank leveraging from the banks of fractional reserve privileges.
[03:16:39.946 --> 03:16:41.546]  And I've said on this show before,
[03:16:42.227 --> 03:16:42.687]  I think so.
[03:17:05.713 --> 03:17:34.640]  uh... merger acquisition uh... bubble uh... has continued to fuel these bubbles ever since then and now it's those bubbles in that bank leveraging that's being withdrawn now where where you may ask did the money come from for the banks to do all of that leverage financing well it came from several sources one was the regulatory agencies including the federal reserve and including the securities and exchange commission
[03:17:35.060 --> 03:17:35.420]  I think so.
[03:17:53.707 --> 03:17:54.328]  We're good to go.
[03:18:12.301 --> 03:18:14.164]  The guy McCain said should be fired.
[03:18:15.206 --> 03:18:24.584]  Cox allowed the SEC to deregulate and to permit investors to put more and more of their investments in bank-leveraged borrowing.
[03:18:25.525 --> 03:18:32.409]  And they got so overextended that this is one of the things that's driven the whole bubble that is now bursting.
[03:18:32.889 --> 03:18:42.694]  And it's part of the deregulation regime that began, of course, under Reagan and has accelerated and now has completely played itself out under Bush.
[03:18:43.314 --> 03:18:49.257]  So what we are really seeing now is the result, the logical conclusion,
[03:18:50.209 --> 03:19:02.857]  Of everything that was done since the 1980s in the Reagan Revolution to deregulate the markets and to allow vast amounts of bank lending to enter into these markets to fuel these bubbles.
[03:19:03.497 --> 03:19:05.258]  It's all coming to an end right now.
[03:19:06.099 --> 03:19:18.426]  And what the financiers, led by Paulson, of course, and Goldman Sachs, is to move money into Treasury bonds so the Treasury can then use that money to buy the toxic debt
[03:19:19.159 --> 03:19:28.995]  Which the financial institutions and the investors, the brokers, will use to pay themselves off one last time.
[03:19:29.557 --> 03:19:35.061]  So we're seeing the end of the bailouts and the end of the payoffs to the financiers who engineered the disaster.
[03:19:35.361 --> 03:19:35.602]  That's right.
[03:19:35.622 --> 03:19:37.443]  They're taking their profit by design.
[03:19:37.463 --> 03:19:39.244]  I want to talk about this controlled implosion.
[03:19:39.685 --> 03:19:43.708]  Congressman being told last week physical martial law would be declared.
[03:19:43.788 --> 03:19:46.250]  I mean, and that hasn't gotten hardly any mainstream attention.
[03:19:46.670 --> 03:19:49.672]  Even in, you know, alternative talk radio it's not being covered.
[03:19:50.373 --> 03:19:57.138]  We are all seeing it come to a head from Richard C. Cook looking forward what he thinks is going to happen in the short, mid, and long term future.
[03:19:57.158 --> 03:19:57.598]  Stay with us.
[03:19:59.181 --> 03:19:59.742]  You invest.
[03:19:59.902 --> 03:20:00.803]  You buy insurance.
[03:20:00.943 --> 03:20:01.904]  You wear your seatbelt.
[03:20:02.184 --> 03:20:04.866]  You do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[03:20:05.047 --> 03:20:05.567]  But why?

[03:20:56.613 --> 03:20:58.114]  Prepare for tomorrow now.
[03:20:59.314 --> 03:21:04.737]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[03:21:05.037 --> 03:21:06.357]  And we knew what to do.
[03:21:06.377 --> 03:21:08.138]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:21:08.358 --> 03:21:14.701]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:21:17.062 --> 03:21:18.062]  The V.A.
[03:21:18.102 --> 03:21:23.945]  director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:21:24.285 --> 03:21:31.088]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:21:31.369 --> 03:21:34.450]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:21:34.530 --> 03:21:39.953]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:21:40.233 --> 03:21:42.914]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[03:21:52.361 --> 03:21:57.265]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:21:59.198 --> 03:22:02.560]  Are you sick and tired of spending your hard-earned money to fill your gas tank?
[03:22:02.880 --> 03:22:04.261]  Then do something about it!
[03:22:04.562 --> 03:22:10.045]  Fuel Saver's Fuel Conditioner lets you drive further on each gallon of fuel, completely safe for all engines.
[03:22:10.165 --> 03:22:19.351]  Just add a small squeeze of product to your tank each time you fill up to improve your fuel economy 10% to 20% or more, saving you $0.35 to $0.80 on every gallon.
[03:22:19.651 --> 03:22:25.175]  Each little two-ounce squeeze bottle is highly concentrated and costs only $8 to treat 100 gallons of gas or 50 gallons of
[03:22:26.616 --> 03:22:26.896]  I don't know.
[03:22:56.482 --> 03:22:57.223]  Call now!
[03:22:58.383 --> 03:23:04.608]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:23:05.048 --> 03:23:12.834]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:23:13.174 --> 03:23:21.039]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[03:23:21.340 --> 03:23:26.103]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:23:26.403 --> 03:23:31.148]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:23:31.628 --> 03:23:35.492]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:23:35.992 --> 03:23:37.013]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:23:37.073 --> 03:23:41.117]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:23:41.577 --> 03:23:45.959]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:23:46.479 --> 03:23:49.041]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[03:23:51.242 --> 03:23:51.462]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:51.482 --> 03:23:53.603]  Quite some time I've been sitting it out Didn't take no chances
[03:24:14.682 --> 03:24:29.407]  Former White House analyst, historian, NASA analyst, writer for major publications like the Washington Post,
[03:24:42.353 --> 03:24:43.153]  Richard C. Cook.
[03:24:43.213 --> 03:24:46.674]  Richard, give out your website and tell us a little bit more about some of the articles and work you've been doing.
[03:24:46.694 --> 03:24:49.675]  And then let's get into where they're going in the future.
[03:24:49.695 --> 03:24:51.075]  I mean, they've geared up for a police state.
[03:24:51.115 --> 03:24:52.055]  They've prepared for this.
[03:24:52.096 --> 03:24:55.236]  They changed the bankruptcy laws to go out to the public.
[03:24:55.256 --> 03:24:58.857]  And then they passed laws where they could take the pensions for themselves with companies.
[03:24:58.877 --> 03:25:01.918]  I mean, I see massive preparation in all of this.
[03:25:01.978 --> 03:25:09.760]  Then last week's unprecedented economic terrorism with every major leader saying, you know, sign over
[03:25:11.857 --> 03:25:12.758]  That's exactly what has happened.
[03:25:12.778 --> 03:25:14.158]  Now, my website, www.RichardCCook.com,
[03:25:35.031 --> 03:25:38.773]  I also have a lot of articles now.
[03:25:38.833 --> 03:25:40.915]  Most of my articles are on global research.
[03:25:40.995 --> 03:25:45.798]  It's www.globalresearch.ca.
[03:25:46.458 --> 03:25:49.139]  And I have an email for comments.
[03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:52.141]  I also have a report on the 08 election.
[03:25:53.162 --> 03:25:57.564]  That's economicsanity at gmail.com.
[03:25:57.804 --> 03:26:00.106]  Economicsanity at gmail.com.
[03:26:00.846 --> 03:26:03.207]  People can write in and get on the mailing list.
[03:26:03.968 --> 03:26:07.529]  But that's exactly what happened, what you described, Alex.
[03:26:07.649 --> 03:26:15.073]  And it's interesting that the dictatorial powers were assumed not on the part of the producing economy,
[03:26:15.934 --> 03:26:20.995]  As has happened at other times in American history, particularly in wartime.
[03:26:21.095 --> 03:26:31.858]  But by the banks, by the financial economy, by what I call the Wall Street fat cats, of which Paulson, of course, is the most prominent.
[03:26:31.878 --> 03:26:42.081]  I mean, Paulson already had been paid before he came to be the Secretary of the Treasury hundreds of millions of dollars in earnings and bonuses.
[03:26:42.870 --> 03:26:43.210]  I think?
[03:26:59.793 --> 03:27:02.997]  Uh, failures in the history of the world.
[03:27:03.017 --> 03:27:04.679]  But they knew it was a failure.
[03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:10.347]  They created the debt bubble by design and were making money selling these derivatives to people all along.
[03:27:10.708 --> 03:27:12.390]  That is absolutely correct.
[03:27:12.610 --> 03:27:16.436]  And they closed all of the doors for the public to get out.
[03:27:17.611 --> 03:27:19.653]  There are so many signs of premeditation.
[03:27:19.693 --> 03:27:29.259]  When you read the IMF and World Bank plans, where the International Bank of Settlements and others have engineered this in third world countries, it's a replay of what was done in Argentina in 2000-2001.
[03:27:29.600 --> 03:27:30.620]  Yes, that's correct.
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:40.107]  It was known that this could happen, and it was done through Congress, which is one of the most shameful episodes in our history, particularly
[03:27:40.774 --> 03:27:47.978]  You know, after that first vote in the House, when enough congressmen stood up and said no, that they had to take it back.
[03:27:48.399 --> 03:27:48.599]  And 1,000-to-1!
[03:27:48.619 --> 03:27:50.000]  1,000-to-1 phone calls against it!
[03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:55.543]  Right, and so instead of trying to put it back through the House, they did an end-run around the House.
[03:27:56.364 --> 03:28:00.206]  They took it to the Senate, where all the senators had already been bought off.
[03:28:00.786 --> 03:28:15.133]  And of course, we all know, you know, we've all seen the reports on campaign contributions and who pays the bills for Barney Frank and Chris Dodd and all the rest, you know, where their campaign money comes from.
[03:28:15.173 --> 03:28:19.815]  And the same goes with Obama and Hillary Clinton and McCain.
[03:28:20.435 --> 03:28:22.016]  They all work for Wall Street.
[03:28:22.776 --> 03:28:24.557]  That's where their financial support is.
[03:28:24.657 --> 03:28:25.778]  And so they came in
[03:28:26.756 --> 03:28:31.213]  In the 11th hour and threatened everyone with a collapsing economy.
[03:28:32.294 --> 03:28:43.936]  wrote a bill where the money from the public is going to be used for years into the future to pay them off so they can take that money and go spend it on fixed assets.
[03:28:44.016 --> 03:28:48.017]  And we're going to see a lot of big houses being bought, a lot of land being bought.
[03:28:48.037 --> 03:28:54.079]  So instead of them getting in trouble for engineering this, they get to be financial kingpins and suck the money out of us.
[03:28:54.099 --> 03:28:56.439]  They get a payoff.
[03:28:56.979 --> 03:29:00.920]  It's what I call, and I wrote this in an article recently, Alex,
[03:29:02.024 --> 03:29:03.826]  It's what I call hush money.
[03:29:04.407 --> 03:29:11.553]  Now, the reason I call it hush money is that this whole thing was not just engineered by the banks.
[03:29:12.334 --> 03:29:17.219]  I have written how back in the, you know, we all know now it came out of
[03:29:18.477 --> 03:29:19.918]  They created this new derivative bubble.
[03:29:19.938 --> 03:29:20.338]  Stay there.
[03:29:20.399 --> 03:29:21.079]  We're going to come back.
[03:29:21.099 --> 03:29:22.880]  Richard C. Cook, final segment with our guest.
[03:29:22.900 --> 03:29:23.821]  Stay with us.
[03:29:48.968 --> 03:29:49.889]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.369 --> 03:29:51.990]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.890 --> 03:29:55.692]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.114 --> 03:30:02.255]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[03:30:02.356 --> 03:30:05.477]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:30:05.837 --> 03:30:07.819]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:30:08.479 --> 03:30:09.520]  But who is the enemy?
[03:30:10.020 --> 03:30:10.540]  Bin Laden.
[03:30:10.800 --> 03:30:11.721]  This is his ammo.
[03:30:11.741 --> 03:30:13.162]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:30:13.202 --> 03:30:14.002]  We have to look to Israel.
[03:30:14.042 --> 03:30:14.262]  Some U.S.
[03:30:14.282 --> 03:30:17.243]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:30:17.263 --> 03:30:19.164]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:30:33.030 --> 03:30:42.893]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much much more.
[03:30:43.134 --> 03:30:43.894]  Fabled enemies.

[03:31:02.434 --> 03:31:05.357]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[03:31:05.497 --> 03:31:08.340]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[03:31:08.520 --> 03:31:11.243]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[03:33:23.003 --> 03:33:29.544]  Historian, analyst, economist.
[03:33:45.558 --> 03:33:45.858]  Author.
[03:33:46.779 --> 03:33:47.200]  Journalist.
[03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:50.684]  RichardCCook.com.
[03:33:51.805 --> 03:33:55.349]  Richard, let's just get down to basics here in a little bit of time we have left with you today.
[03:33:56.897 --> 03:34:00.958]  The public, I don't think, has any inkling of where we're going.
[03:34:01.579 --> 03:34:23.505]  I still think that some of them think it's hype, even when CNN announces, hey, army brigades, and we read carefully, it's multiple brigades, they're gonna deal with rioting people, and the British say, we're getting ready for riots over the economy, and we got microwave guns ready in the U.S., and I had congressmen on last week, they were told, martial law will be declared, you'll be basically thrown out if you don't do this,
[03:34:24.953 --> 03:34:26.293]  I mean, that is terrorism.
[03:34:26.353 --> 03:34:27.174]  That is threats.
[03:34:28.295 --> 03:34:32.217]  And so where you see this going, because the public, thank God, didn't get suckered.
[03:34:32.277 --> 03:34:37.561]  Ninety-plus percent still said no after the financial terrorism Monday afternoon when the House voted it down.
[03:34:38.411 --> 03:34:54.875]  A trillion, 200 plus billion lost, and then they acquiesced, at least in Congress, to the scaremongering and threats, and then now the plunging has intensified, with the market down at 9,600 and something today, down over 400 points, or 300 plus points, down over 400 yesterday.
[03:34:54.895 --> 03:35:03.477]  I mean, this is getting to be, we're not talking about weeks or months if this continues, I mean, the malls, Austin is supposedly
[03:35:05.064 --> 03:35:22.109]  uh... the you know wealthiest per capita city in the country the best off in the recession the real estate markets plunging and my wife went last week to the mall to get a prescription for glasses done she said she's been there before and it's full it's empty everybody's talking about it and we're in a good city
[03:35:23.373 --> 03:35:30.539]  It is homeless people all over the country exploding, tripling their numbers in the different indexes we have, and this is only the beginning.
[03:35:30.799 --> 03:35:41.606]  So, A, what is the public, who's already mad, going to do when they find out this bailout went to offshore banking crime syndicates, that the elite are all literally leaving the country to Dubai and Switzerland?
[03:35:42.047 --> 03:35:47.871]  And then how do you see this unfolding, the way they're going to govern it, versus what you think we should do to avert it?
[03:35:48.371 --> 03:35:53.934]  Well, we're going into a long-term recession right now, and probably a depression.
[03:35:54.915 --> 03:35:58.116]  And it's not only in the United States, it's worldwide.
[03:35:58.416 --> 03:36:00.498]  Yeah, it's sucking down the Euro this week, everything!
[03:36:00.778 --> 03:36:11.403]  Yeah, it's happening throughout Europe, and when the Asian countries can no longer sell their products to the United States, their economies are going to freeze up too, now.
[03:36:14.821 --> 03:36:22.325]  Here's the difference, though, where the Asian economies have an advantage, which is that they produce things.
[03:36:22.525 --> 03:36:24.126]  We don't produce things anymore.
[03:36:24.906 --> 03:36:26.747]  We gave away our industry.
[03:36:27.568 --> 03:36:29.709]  We gave away our family farming.
[03:36:30.396 --> 03:36:32.680]  We gave them all to global capitalism.
[03:36:33.241 --> 03:36:36.566]  We gave them to the people who put NAFTA through.
[03:36:37.127 --> 03:36:41.414]  We gave them to the people who put through China as a most favored trading nation.
[03:36:41.915 --> 03:36:44.639]  We don't have it anymore, so where are we going to get it?
[03:36:45.370 --> 03:36:49.052]  Where are we going to get the food when we can't buy the food on credit anymore?
[03:36:49.493 --> 03:36:53.796]  Where are we going to get the consumer products when we can't buy those on credit anymore?
[03:36:53.816 --> 03:36:55.417]  The answer is nowhere.
[03:36:55.557 --> 03:36:56.838]  Well let me tell you about East Texas.
[03:36:56.998 --> 03:37:00.280]  A year ago in East Texas where I have family, they have the swan trucks.
[03:37:00.860 --> 03:37:01.201]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:37:18.766 --> 03:37:27.872]  Talking to everybody out in the country, the majority of people said, we can't even afford this inexpensive food anymore because we're spending it on gas just to get to work.
[03:37:27.932 --> 03:37:38.600]  I mean, it's already in Michigan and East Texas and Florida and the states are going bankrupt and the credit card debt's coming bankrupt and now the bankers are saying they're going to bail out their cronies and select corporations.
[03:37:38.620 --> 03:37:39.880]  I mean, I'm sorry, I'm just ranting.
[03:37:39.920 --> 03:37:41.902]  It's just... Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
[03:37:41.942 --> 03:37:47.846]  And, you know, I started writing several months ago that
[03:37:48.507 --> 03:37:50.390]  People say it can't happen here.
[03:37:51.251 --> 03:37:57.418]  Yet we already have, or had at that time a year ago, 35 million Americans who didn't have enough food to eat.
[03:37:58.300 --> 03:38:03.526]  And people were laughing about that because the government was calling them nutritionally challenged.
[03:38:04.307 --> 03:38:06.310]  Well, that number has not gone away.
[03:38:07.397 --> 03:38:17.403]  But if you look at the collapse of farming in this country and the inability that this nation has to even grow its own food anymore, this could happen here.
[03:38:17.844 --> 03:38:21.146]  We could have large-scale food shortages in this country.
[03:38:21.166 --> 03:38:22.266]  Well, that's the issue!
[03:38:22.307 --> 03:38:23.647]  That's the issue!
[03:38:23.847 --> 03:38:25.148]  Well, that's the next issue.
[03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:32.753]  90% agrarian in the Great Depression, now 90% urban, and of the 10%, half of those aren't even self-sufficient.
[03:38:32.833 --> 03:38:34.734]  We have 5% that are self-sufficient.
[03:38:36.275 --> 03:38:37.857]  Road Warrior, Mad Max.
[03:38:39.378 --> 03:38:40.799]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:42.641]  And what are people going to do?
[03:38:42.721 --> 03:38:44.983]  Are they going to let themselves be put out of their houses?
[03:38:45.824 --> 03:38:49.988]  What are they going to do when they don't have enough food to eat or their family doesn't have enough food to eat?
[03:38:50.028 --> 03:38:54.212]  I'm seeing reports from Tennessee and Texas where people are holed up in houses.
[03:38:54.292 --> 03:38:57.194]  Just this morning I saw one and the cops just gunned them down.
[03:39:00.908 --> 03:39:06.715]  Yeah, we saw what happened to that woman, I guess it was in Ohio, that's now being reported on TV.
[03:39:07.316 --> 03:39:08.737]  This is starting to happen.
[03:39:08.998 --> 03:39:17.548]  And one of the features of this bailout plan is that Paulson and his people were adamant
[03:39:18.246 --> 03:39:22.908]  That they were not going to allow housing prices to fall anymore.
[03:39:23.428 --> 03:39:26.410]  That people were going to be held to their mortgages.
[03:39:26.470 --> 03:39:34.634]  And Paulson said on TV, when he was testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, that foreclosures were going to continue.
[03:39:34.674 --> 03:39:36.795]  This is not a plan to help people with their mortgages.
[03:39:36.835 --> 03:39:37.235]  And let's be clear.
[03:39:37.255 --> 03:39:38.075]  We're bailing them out.
[03:39:38.135 --> 03:39:39.176]  It's going to devalue the dollar.
[03:39:39.196 --> 03:39:41.617]  And they said, the Fed chairman said two weeks ago,
[03:39:42.097 --> 03:39:45.699]  Top dollar will be paid for these so they know the people will default.
[03:39:46.099 --> 03:39:50.521]  The banks will be paid top dollar and then even get to repossess it.
[03:39:50.781 --> 03:39:51.181]  That's right.
[03:39:51.221 --> 03:39:54.683]  And then you had people saying, Bernanke said this,
[03:39:55.385 --> 03:40:03.155]  That when the money was paid back to the public from these mortgage-backed securities, they weren't going to lose money, and they might even make money.
[03:40:03.776 --> 03:40:09.243]  And the only way that that's possible is if the people who owe the money still have to pay it.
[03:40:09.684 --> 03:40:13.489]  Now, Countrywide has just announced a program to their credit.
[03:40:14.814 --> 03:40:23.981]  Countrywide, of course, is now owned by Bank of America, that they're going to start allowing people to scale back on the principal and the interest that they owe on their houses.
[03:40:24.061 --> 03:40:32.848]  So at least there's some little glimmer of common sense coming through by the people who are holding the mortgages, but it sure is not part of the government plan.
[03:40:33.409 --> 03:40:43.397]  What is in the government plan is a travesty, and you just have to wonder when the banking lobbyists and when the Bush administration lobbyists were going around
[03:40:44.037 --> 03:40:53.465]  Congress last week, in the House of Representatives, twisting arms of those congressmen to get them to change their votes to pass this bill.
[03:40:53.685 --> 03:40:55.426]  What were they threatening them with?
[03:40:56.007 --> 03:40:59.629]  You know, what were they pulling out of their... Well, they told them martial law!
[03:40:59.730 --> 03:41:00.730]  They told them martial law!
[03:41:01.071 --> 03:41:03.052]  Yeah, so there you have it.
[03:41:03.072 --> 03:41:04.153]  It was done by threats.
[03:41:04.193 --> 03:41:05.474]  It was done by coercion.
[03:41:06.054 --> 03:41:10.258]  You know, even then, a hundred and some congressmen still had the guts to say no.
[03:41:11.129 --> 03:41:13.190]  But not enough to stop the juggernaut.
[03:41:13.230 --> 03:41:27.415]  Well, that shows that the establishment is going for broke, because when you start getting elites threatening martial law to Congress, and then the congressman came on the show and said, well, under House rules, I can't tell you what was told me in confidence.
[03:41:27.995 --> 03:41:30.376]  I mean, that shows the establishment is going for broke.
[03:41:30.676 --> 03:41:31.256]  Yeah, it did.
[03:41:31.496 --> 03:41:31.797]  It did.
[03:41:32.197 --> 03:41:38.139]  Now, whether it was going for broke merely to get one last raid on the Treasury,
[03:41:38.892 --> 03:41:44.235]  Or whether it has something longer term and more sinister in mind, I honestly don't know.
[03:41:44.976 --> 03:41:46.557]  Bush is clearly bailing out.
[03:41:47.717 --> 03:41:48.758]  Cheney is bailing out.
[03:41:48.778 --> 03:41:52.460]  They moved Halliburton to Dubai, so maybe he's going bye-bye to Dubai.
[03:41:52.500 --> 03:41:57.203]  And the Bushes are going down to Paraguay, where I talked to a top investigative journalist.
[03:41:58.306 --> 03:42:03.730]  A few weeks ago, I mean top, international, they say Ken Lay is alive in Paraguay.
[03:42:04.091 --> 03:42:06.392]  Well, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.
[03:42:06.453 --> 03:42:16.661]  So, maybe this is just their last attempt to take the money and run, or maybe they have something in mind that is much more sinister than that.
[03:42:16.781 --> 03:42:17.962]  Again, I do not know.
[03:42:18.682 --> 03:42:30.792]  I do not have the answer to that, but clearly they've ramped up, they've geared up to keep order in the streets by using the army just as they did during the Katrina disaster.
[03:42:30.832 --> 03:42:33.434]  So it looks to me like a nationwide Katrina.
[03:42:34.134 --> 03:42:42.201]  This is a financial and an economic hurricane that's going to have the same effects as that and it's going to be just as disastrous.
[03:42:43.241 --> 03:42:47.425]  If we get a new president in office in November,
[03:42:48.426 --> 03:42:56.471]  Uh, who intends to do anything about it, then the obvious answer, and what all the Democrats are saying is, that we're going to see the New Deal back again.
[03:42:56.491 --> 03:43:03.215]  Uh, now whether it's, uh, there's any time even to do that, I don't know.
[03:43:03.235 --> 03:43:08.038]  Yeah, but their New Deal is homeland security, law enforcement jobs, more prisons.
[03:43:08.078 --> 03:43:10.320]  I've been talking about that for years, and Barack Obama,
[03:43:11.694 --> 03:43:15.158]  He's gotten three times the Wall Street money that McCain has.
[03:43:15.538 --> 03:43:16.580]  How do you square that?
[03:43:17.321 --> 03:43:17.961]  Well, I don't.
[03:43:18.322 --> 03:43:21.365]  That's the big unknown.
[03:43:21.746 --> 03:43:28.474]  There would be no problem for the Democrats to print money just the way they're printing money to give to the bankers.
[03:43:28.974 --> 03:43:32.138]  To print money and pay people to dig ditches and fill them up again.
[03:43:32.158 --> 03:43:38.185]  Yeah, if they're going to kill the dollar, they might as well in the next few years build a real economy so we got something left.
[03:43:38.545 --> 03:43:38.905]  Correct.
[03:43:38.945 --> 03:43:40.087]  That's the only real hope we have.
[03:43:40.147 --> 03:43:41.488]  Instead it's all going offshore.
[03:43:41.508 --> 03:43:42.590]  And I don't mean to yell, Richard.
[03:43:42.730 --> 03:43:43.451]  No, you're right.
[03:43:43.831 --> 03:43:44.992]  How do you contain yourself?
[03:43:45.032 --> 03:43:47.275]  Because I know what this means to my beloved country.
[03:43:48.035 --> 03:43:57.165]  People who talk about they love it, I really do love it, because this is the only country I got, it's where my roots are, and I'm watching it all die, it all be stolen by these fraudsters.
[03:43:57.545 --> 03:44:02.991]  That's right, and the only hope is to take that same treasury money they're printing
[03:44:04.032 --> 03:44:08.436]  And giving it away to the financiers and begin to do something for the people.
[03:44:08.556 --> 03:44:08.996]  Exactly!
[03:44:09.036 --> 03:44:11.818]  Helicopterman isn't helicoptering money to the people.
[03:44:12.078 --> 03:44:15.081]  He's helicoptering it overseas to international banks.
[03:44:15.161 --> 03:44:17.222]  They need to be helicoptering it on us.
[03:44:17.562 --> 03:44:18.903]  And he's lying about it.
[03:44:19.564 --> 03:44:30.352]  Now, the hope is, and the title of my next book, which I hope will be out within a few weeks, is We Hold These Truths, The Hope of Monetary Reform.
[03:44:31.329 --> 03:44:48.882]  The hope lies with the fact that there are enough people within this country in the monetary reform movement to be able to at least arrest the hemorrhaging and to put in place a monetary system and an economy that will put
[03:44:49.708 --> 03:44:54.131]  Money back into the hands of people that they need to rebuild the economy from the bottom up.
[03:44:54.671 --> 03:45:00.255]  And the key to this, really Alex, goes back to what I started talking about in the very first place.
[03:45:00.315 --> 03:45:01.276]  It's purchasing power.
[03:45:02.074 --> 03:45:16.921]  People do not have purchasing power any longer because their jobs, their farms, their small businesses were all taken away from them by the financial looting of the global financial industrialists.
[03:45:16.941 --> 03:45:17.861]  Well, I'm going to have you back on.
[03:45:17.881 --> 03:45:22.223]  We're about to have to end this, Richard, because I'm going to cover the financial news, but I agree with you.
[03:45:23.241 --> 03:45:25.243]  And I am against helicoptering money.
[03:45:25.283 --> 03:45:27.525]  It's better for it to be at the grassroots and it devalues it.
[03:45:27.565 --> 03:45:32.670]  But they clearly have decided to kill the dollar in the next three years and bring out some new monetary unit.
[03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:34.611]  They've openly said that's their plan.
[03:45:35.032 --> 03:45:37.254]  So in the interim, we might as well build up some real economy.
[03:45:37.274 --> 03:45:38.235]  But we know that's not...
[03:45:38.775 --> 03:45:41.157]  Going to be basically what happens unless there's political will.
[03:45:41.497 --> 03:45:56.007]  What about a national call for the fact that they're criminals pointing out their insider trading, their conflict of interest, all the... I mean, you know, the Goldman Sachs VP to hand out the $700 billion, I mean, under the former head of Goldman Sachs.
[03:45:56.047 --> 03:46:00.530]  I mean, this isn't even the pretense of legality.
[03:46:00.690 --> 03:46:04.833]  And I think we need to have state grand juries, as Ron Paul said two weeks ago here on the show,
[03:46:07.805 --> 03:46:09.006]  I totally agree.
[03:46:09.266 --> 03:46:23.711]  If you look at my last article on global research, titled Grand Larceny, I begin to go through there the breakdown of how it was done at the political level by the Bush administration with the collusion
[03:46:24.660 --> 03:46:28.742]  of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
[03:46:28.762 --> 03:46:30.222]  He was a crime from the top.
[03:46:30.702 --> 03:46:35.024]  One of the people who tried to stop this was Eliot Spitzer when he was Attorney General of New York.
[03:46:35.044 --> 03:46:37.104]  And so they found his crooked toe nail and got him.
[03:46:37.345 --> 03:46:41.766]  They got him, yeah, because he'd blown the whistle on the fact that the U.S.
[03:46:41.786 --> 03:46:46.628]  Department of Treasury, the comptroller of the currency, the department I used to work for,
[03:46:47.368 --> 03:46:52.292]  He was saying he was going to investigate from the state level and they said, uh-uh, buddy.
[03:47:03.149 --> 03:47:03.589]  That's right.
[03:47:03.729 --> 03:47:05.330]  They blocked the investigations.
[03:47:05.430 --> 03:47:05.951]  It was done.
[03:47:05.971 --> 03:47:13.435]  This wasn't a bunch of mortgage brokers out there telling people, come on, cheat on your application so I can make a few extra bucks.
[03:47:13.755 --> 03:47:15.056]  That's how they're portraying it.
[03:47:15.476 --> 03:47:21.559]  This was a top-down program put in place by the highest political and financial levels.
[03:47:22.060 --> 03:47:22.880]  Well, absolutely.
[03:47:22.900 --> 03:47:25.301]  They admit that in the IMF and World Bank documents.
[03:47:25.361 --> 03:47:27.603]  Well, Richard C. Cook, I want to get you back on.
[03:47:28.483 --> 03:47:29.484]  Next week, if you can.
[03:47:29.885 --> 03:47:31.786]  Let's do an hour on monetary reform.
[03:47:32.247 --> 03:47:38.352]  So, down the road, people, after this fully crashes, know what can really be done.
[03:47:38.392 --> 03:47:51.083]  I mean, if we had a free market left, and an economy left, I would say the libertarian model, but when it's this shot, and the economy's like a dying man on the beach who's been grounding, you've got to, you know, defibrillate him to get his heart going.
[03:47:52.765 --> 03:47:53.466]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:47:53.746 --> 03:47:54.066]  I agree.
[03:47:54.467 --> 03:47:55.307]  I'll be glad to get back.
[03:47:55.488 --> 03:47:56.649]  All right, Richard Cook, thank you.
[03:47:56.669 --> 03:47:57.069]  Take care.
[03:47:57.089 --> 03:47:57.890]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[03:47:58.050 --> 03:47:58.330]  You bet.
[03:47:58.370 --> 03:47:59.031]  There he goes.
[03:47:59.051 --> 03:48:05.217]  For the balance of the show, I want to go over the stock market numbers, what we're looking at from CNBC, CNN.
[03:48:05.237 --> 03:48:09.881]  It's also up on InfoWars.com and PrisonMoney.com, some key articles from Paul Watson there.
[03:48:10.221 --> 03:48:11.883]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up.
[03:48:11.963 --> 03:48:15.426]  Gold is trading at $880 plus and shooting straight up.
[03:48:16.458 --> 03:48:24.566]  Even mainline CNN, ABC News are all reporting that there has been a manipulation in the gold paper to keep it down.
[03:48:24.606 --> 03:48:28.650]  That's now not Ted Anderson, it's CNN, it's MSNBC, it's all over the news.
[03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:30.391]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:48:31.492 --> 03:48:37.658]  They've artificially suppressed the paper cost, but that we're going to see this paradox of manipulation
[03:48:38.763 --> 03:48:42.186]  Where gold's $2,000 an ounce, but gold paper is $900.
[03:48:43.388 --> 03:48:49.153]  And so what everything Ted's been saying and Ron Paul's been saying is now being said by mainstream news.
[03:48:49.173 --> 03:48:50.294]  They can no longer hide it.
[03:48:50.314 --> 03:48:53.778]  And this is an amazing admission, Ted, that we're now seeing.
[03:48:54.018 --> 03:48:58.042]  I believe they're putting this out because they don't want to be caught, you know, behind the curve.
[03:48:58.062 --> 03:48:59.463]  They want to look like they told the people.
[03:48:59.483 --> 03:49:00.184]  This is big, Ted.
[03:49:00.644 --> 03:49:11.808]  Yeah, yeah, they've been manipulating the gold prices through the futures market all along here, trying to keep that down, because if they can keep that down, it gives the illusion that the United States dollar is going to be strong and okay.
[03:49:11.888 --> 03:49:14.069]  Well, you know, wake up everybody.
[03:49:14.089 --> 03:49:17.550]  I mean, our whole economic system is melting down.
[03:49:17.570 --> 03:49:23.373]  I mean, if you're talking about, who are we going to dump the helicopters, who are we going to dump the helicopter loads of money onto?
[03:49:23.713 --> 03:49:24.333]  Is it going to be the
[03:49:24.773 --> 03:49:27.114]  The financial leaders are going to be the U.S.
[03:49:27.174 --> 03:49:27.634]  citizens.
[03:49:27.674 --> 03:49:31.315]  My God, once you start giving away something for free, it has no value.
[03:49:31.815 --> 03:49:33.656]  And that's exactly what's going on with the U.S.
[03:49:33.716 --> 03:49:34.076]  dollar.
[03:49:34.336 --> 03:49:37.377]  And yeah, you're right, they are trying to manipulate, but right now the dollar's down.
[03:49:37.677 --> 03:49:38.797]  The Dow Jones is down.
[03:49:38.817 --> 03:49:39.717]  The Russell's down.
[03:49:39.757 --> 03:49:42.478]  Just about everything on the New York Stock Exchange is down.
[03:49:42.678 --> 03:49:44.379]  But gold is up $28.80, going straight up at $884.10.
[03:49:44.459 --> 03:49:46.999]  And ladies and gentlemen, Ted still has gold at last week's price.
[03:49:53.417 --> 03:50:06.447]  A whopping 50 bucks cheaper than it now is, and he for a limited time is offering you last week's prices now, but it is going to be gone by tomorrow if this continues.
[03:50:06.487 --> 03:50:07.428]  Ted, tell them the coins.
[03:50:07.908 --> 03:50:09.590]  Yeah, sure, I'll be happy to tell them the coins.
[03:50:09.810 --> 03:50:14.794]  Same deal, exact same deal that I offered yesterday, but yet gold's up another 30-some bucks today.
[03:50:14.974 --> 03:50:18.595]  And the deal yesterday was $25.30 over what it was last week.
[03:50:18.695 --> 03:50:18.995]  Exactly.
[03:50:19.015 --> 03:50:22.156]  This was locked in closer to $800 an ounce, and it's $900.
[03:50:22.276 --> 03:50:25.857]  And right now gold is seeing a high of $890.
[03:50:26.437 --> 03:50:27.417]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:50:27.457 --> 03:50:28.878]  So it's $80-something bucks cheaper.
[03:50:29.098 --> 03:50:29.918]  Oh yeah, it's huge.
[03:50:30.038 --> 03:50:32.999]  So this is as good as that deal you offered two weeks ago that was the best deal ever?
[03:50:33.119 --> 03:50:33.459]  It is.
[03:50:33.979 --> 03:50:34.219]  It is.
[03:50:34.239 --> 03:50:34.619]  Hold on.
[03:50:34.639 --> 03:50:35.559]  Okay, okay.
[03:50:36.020 --> 03:50:37.220]  Folks, do the math.
[03:50:37.967 --> 03:50:39.748]  Ted bought gold at $800 an ounce.
[03:50:39.828 --> 03:50:40.629]  It's $884.
[03:50:41.109 --> 03:50:43.051]  You cannot beat this deal anywhere.
[03:50:43.091 --> 03:50:45.312]  You will not find a better deal anywhere.
[03:50:46.033 --> 03:50:48.454]  He'll tell you the coins when we get back, but here's the number.
[03:50:48.474 --> 03:50:48.514]  800-686-2237.
[03:50:48.534 --> 03:50:48.574]  800-686-2237.
[03:50:48.594 --> 03:50:51.136]  And we'll find out from Ted on the other side how long he can hold this deal open.
[03:51:00.609 --> 03:51:05.893]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[03:51:06.253 --> 03:51:08.535]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[03:51:08.895 --> 03:51:12.358]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[03:51:12.558 --> 03:51:15.500]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation.
[03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:23.824]  We can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.

[03:51:46.357 --> 03:51:47.738]  It is a big idea.
[03:51:47.818 --> 03:51:48.539]  A new world order.
[03:52:03.326 --> 03:52:08.130]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:52:08.210 --> 03:52:10.391]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:52:11.052 --> 03:52:13.314]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:52:13.854 --> 03:52:16.296]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:52:17.036 --> 03:52:24.462]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:52:27.384 --> 03:52:32.348]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:52:32.808 --> 03:52:36.289]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:52:36.689 --> 03:52:39.190]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:52:39.250 --> 03:52:40.390]  Most people have no idea.
[03:52:40.410 --> 03:52:41.170]  They're not after money.
[03:52:41.190 --> 03:52:42.270]  They have all the money they need.
[03:52:42.470 --> 03:52:43.191]  They're after power.
[03:52:43.431 --> 03:52:44.311]  That's what they're after.

[03:52:56.154 --> 03:52:57.274]  You have been warned.
[03:52:58.391 --> 03:53:01.754]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:53:01.894 --> 03:53:07.119]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:53:07.299 --> 03:53:12.083]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:53:12.463 --> 03:53:23.573]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:53:23.973 --> 03:53:29.516]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[03:53:29.756 --> 03:53:35.819]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:53:36.019 --> 03:53:36.640]  What about you?
[03:53:37.040 --> 03:53:38.961]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[03:54:04.805 --> 03:54:06.366]  Man, the bankers are going the distance.
[03:54:06.426 --> 03:54:07.827]  They are just gutting everything.
[03:54:09.729 --> 03:54:14.712]  The stock market was down the Dow about 400 points yesterday.
[03:54:14.732 --> 03:54:16.714]  It's down 434 points today to 9,520.
[03:54:17.494 --> 03:54:19.016]  Trillions being lost every day.
[03:54:19.076 --> 03:54:20.196]  They are looting it all.
[03:54:20.597 --> 03:54:24.259]  I told you, after they got the new power, they would drive all the stocks down.
[03:54:25.060 --> 03:54:26.501]  They promised if you give them the power,
[03:54:27.452 --> 03:54:31.515]  That they would then save it, but instead now they want to drop everything so they can buy it up.
[03:54:32.135 --> 03:54:33.496]  And then they're going to devalue the dollar.
[03:54:33.536 --> 03:54:39.079]  It's already plunging today, but it'll... Oh my... Ted, I can't... I knew all this would happen.
[03:54:39.099 --> 03:54:41.541]  They said they were going to do it, but to witness it...
[03:54:42.384 --> 03:54:50.134]  And to just hear a former White House analyst and analyst for the Securities and Exchange Commission saying everything we're saying, they are really doing this.
[03:54:50.174 --> 03:54:51.475]  But I guess people shouldn't listen to us.
[03:54:51.495 --> 03:54:57.002]  They shouldn't get gold that you secured at 80 plus dollars under what it's selling for now.
[03:54:57.282 --> 03:54:59.204]  They shouldn't move out of paper into that, Ted.
[03:54:59.425 --> 03:55:00.786]  They should just stay on the stock market.
[03:55:00.967 --> 03:55:02.028]  You know, I have family.
[03:55:02.651 --> 03:55:03.732]  They really don't, Alex.
[03:55:03.972 --> 03:55:07.634]  I mean, the stock market has a lot to do with what's going on in the leverage markets.
[03:55:24.344 --> 03:55:30.269]  Crises in the housing market and the crises in the credit market with all the banks that can't trade amongst each other.
[03:55:30.289 --> 03:55:32.971]  The commercial paper market is in trouble.
[03:55:33.391 --> 03:55:36.293]  I mean, just everything that has to do with paper is in trouble.
[03:55:36.513 --> 03:55:38.395]  And what do you think is going to happen to these companies?
[03:55:38.455 --> 03:55:42.658]  I mean, big, big name companies right now are getting bailed out so they don't fail.
[03:55:43.358 --> 03:55:43.759]  I think?
[03:56:04.338 --> 03:56:09.721]  Bankers have sucked that dry and they got the 3rd Brigade to make sure we submit and brainwash police.
[03:56:09.741 --> 03:56:10.502]  I hope they wake up.
[03:56:10.782 --> 03:56:16.446]  Ted, tell them about the coins you've got in supply that you secured at $80 under what it is right now.
[03:56:17.066 --> 03:56:18.067]  Wait, the last deal was about $80.
[03:56:18.707 --> 03:56:20.548]  Is this the all-time best deal?
[03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:27.475]  It's probably a twin of what we did, what was it, two weeks ago when the market took up like a rocket like it did today here.
[03:56:28.737 --> 03:56:30.959]  Right now I do have the Frankster at $190.
[03:56:31.019 --> 03:56:35.645]  Anybody that listened yesterday knows that that's the same price as yesterday and gold is up a lot more today.
[03:56:35.665 --> 03:56:36.766]  It's the same price as Friday.
[03:56:36.906 --> 03:56:40.249]  Yep, same price as Friday, because yesterday's price was the same as Friday.
[03:56:40.289 --> 03:56:41.971]  British Sovereigns, I still have those at $2.34.
[03:56:42.011 --> 03:56:44.413]  That's a quarter ounce coin, you can do the math.
[03:56:45.334 --> 03:56:51.480]  It is next to melt, and that's because the prices have gone up so much.
[03:56:51.500 --> 03:56:54.903]  And folks can't even find melt out there, and that's a semi-collectible coin.
[03:56:54.923 --> 03:56:57.065]  Yeah, you can't buy coins that melt anymore.
[03:56:57.405 --> 03:56:58.886]  The physical market has dried up.
[03:56:58.926 --> 03:56:59.987]  There's not enough available.
[03:57:00.047 --> 03:57:12.437]  Just like you said, the physical market, the spread between physical market coins and the spot price of gold and silver both has widened, and it's going to continue to widen because people are buying this stuff, putting it away, and taking it out of the market.
[03:57:12.737 --> 03:57:17.541]  That $10 Indian, though, that we talked about yesterday, they're at $6.73.
[03:57:20.343 --> 03:57:22.184]  Try to get supply on $10 Indians.
[03:57:22.244 --> 03:57:24.006]  It's almost like the market forgot about them.
[03:57:24.206 --> 03:57:25.467]  We still have the silver half dollars.
[03:57:25.587 --> 03:57:26.647]  Yes, we do.
[03:57:26.667 --> 03:57:27.127]  800-686-2237.
[03:57:29.488 --> 03:57:30.129]  Prison Planet.
[03:57:30.449 --> 03:57:32.770]  Headline, Gold prices to double on paper market.
[03:57:33.070 --> 03:57:34.811]  Demand of physical gold outstripping supplies.
[03:57:34.851 --> 03:57:38.332]  Global interest rate cuts lead flight from paper currencies.
[03:57:39.212 --> 03:57:49.817]  And it says Jörg Kenner, CEO of Swiss Asia Capital, told CNBC this morning that the flight from paper currencies as a result of global interest rate cuts will lead to doubling the price of gold within a short period.
[03:57:50.317 --> 03:57:52.999]  And we don't know if that's going to happen, but that's being predicted on mainstream news.
[03:57:53.459 --> 03:57:58.503]  As demand for physical precious metals outstrips supplies, causing paper contracts on gold to default.
[03:57:58.863 --> 03:58:00.965]  The physical market may have been on fire.
[03:58:00.985 --> 03:58:05.008]  It's getting very hard to buy one ounce coins in smaller bars.
[03:58:05.088 --> 03:58:06.549]  Most jewelry shops have been running out.
[03:58:06.989 --> 03:58:09.091]  On and on and on he talks about the fraud that's going on.

[03:58:13.594 --> 03:58:15.636]  Defeat the New World Order, at least personally.
[03:58:15.937 --> 03:58:18.659]  Protect yourself from the bankers looting everything.
[03:58:19.139 --> 03:58:24.564]  So they've got Indians, they've got Franks, they've got British Sovereigns, and they've got silver half-dollar Franklins.
[03:58:24.584 --> 03:58:24.644]  800-686-2237.
[03:58:24.704 --> 03:58:25.285]  Ted, thank you.
[03:58:25.305 --> 03:58:28.628]  Thanks for having me up, Alex.
[03:58:28.908 --> 03:58:29.188]  You bet.
[03:58:29.909 --> 03:58:31.350]  And you can hold that till midnight, right?
[03:58:31.791 --> 03:58:32.491]  Yep, I'll be here.
[03:58:32.551 --> 03:58:33.392]  We'll do it till midnight.
[03:58:33.412 --> 03:58:33.792]  All right.
