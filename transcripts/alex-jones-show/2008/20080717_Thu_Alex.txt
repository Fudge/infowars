[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.792]  Term free, 33 dollars.
[00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.097]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:23.581]  We've got Tex Mars with us for close to an hour and a half, and we have Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker of the Taxi to the Dark Side, as Dick Cheney called it, the torture camps where they torture children to death, joining us.
[00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.442]  She's also got a new film coming out about Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:35.564]  But we are joined for the next hour and 20 minutes or so by a professor of space and aeronautics and military science, Tex Mars.
[00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:36.905]  He was an officer in the Air Force.
[00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:57.725]  He's had a whole bunch of best-selling books, not just on the New World Order and global government, but he's written the books that are, only one gets chosen a year, the official book on how to pass the armed services military exam and all sorts of scholarly stuff.
[00:00:57.745 --> 00:00:58.766]  He's really a scholar.
[00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:00.828]  And we've been having him on quite a bit lately.
[00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:03.392]  We're really honored to have him in the studio with us.
[00:01:03.432 --> 00:01:13.865]  We're blessed to have him and his wife, Wanda Mars, and their great staff over at Power of Prophecy here in Austin, Texas, really serving the world with some of the best and most heartening information.
[00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:15.287]  out there available.
[00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:19.889]  We had him on twice in the last month about mysterious monuments.
[00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.832]  For the prisonplanet.tv viewers, I showed you some of the pages here on air.
[00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:24.812]  He's got some more today.
[00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:27.994]  We'll be showing folks here on the document cam.
[00:01:28.875 --> 00:01:35.999]  But because so much has happened today, and because Texas made films about this and written books about this from the source documents,
[00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:47.048]  I wanted to first thank Tex for being here, but then get his response to Barack Obama coming out in a speech saying, million plus youth brigade armed and it's spying on the American people.
[00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:47.749]  They even said it.
[00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.233]  Now we know they've been setting it up, and we know Obama didn't invent this, he's just the front.
[00:01:53.193 --> 00:02:03.696]  And then they've announced in Chicago they're going to use the National Guard for gun confiscation and all over they have this knock and talk where police are trying to come to people's houses from Boston to Dallas to Tucson to L.A.
[00:02:04.176 --> 00:02:08.977]  under federal grants and they're taking blood at warrantless checkpoints now all over the country.
[00:02:09.857 --> 00:02:15.899]  And so they are really trying to get in our comfort zones and I wanted to get Tex Marr's take on that.
[00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.679]  Tex, it's a real honor to have you here.
[00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:18.919]  Hey Alex, great to be with you again.
[00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.260]  And it really is a momentous time.
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.704]  You know, this scheme by Barack Obama is not new.
[00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:35.972]  And as you mentioned earlier on your program, we go back to the Soviet era, when they had the Soviet communist youth.
[00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:43.498]  Also, remember the incredible brigades of red youth during the days of Mao Zedong.
[00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.144]  And Hillary Rodham Clinton, of all things, proposed a great youth corps for America.
[00:02:50.684 --> 00:02:59.915]  So, I believe that Barack is simply following in this socialist, communist line that we've seen really the last century.
[00:03:00.576 --> 00:03:05.662]  And you know, they believe that they can capture one entire generation, the youth.
[00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:11.128]  And if they can convert that youth into their way of thinking,
[00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:17.383]  And to the, as Gorbachev called it, perestroika, that that will mean a total victory for them.
[00:03:17.743 --> 00:03:18.924]  And I believe that's true.
[00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:24.408]  Now, the interesting thing is, you know, we were at Brave New Books just last week, and guess what?
[00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:30.353]  Much of the crowd there that's interested in exposing this, that are angry, are the youth.
[00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:36.418]  I think we have an incredible tide here of young people who are waking up
[00:03:37.054 --> 00:03:46.181]  Now, some of the old people, unfortunately, I'm a little older, and I'm a little embarrassed that maybe my generation, because the youth of America are beginning to say, hey, wait just a minute.
[00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:51.084]  This is an age of barbarism, and we're not going to take this anymore.
[00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:58.910]  And I think the youth understand the sacrifices made by Americans in generations past.
[00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.732]  And they're saying, we're not going to forfeit
[00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:05.477]  What great generations before us did.
[00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:07.638]  We're not going to forfeit those freedoms.
[00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:12.700]  But again, Barack Obama, John McCain, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.783]  This is a very false dichotomy, this left-right spectrum.
[00:04:19.143 --> 00:04:20.604]  And I want people to understand something.
[00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:31.529]  People out there who are listening to us who may consider themselves as on the left side, okay, of center, they may believe that, well, if we get somebody like Barack Obama,
[00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.677]  Who says he's for change, everything will be okay.
[00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.206]  I'm afraid that some people will go to sleep.
[00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:43.326]  Because they believe that, hey, we're leftists, now we've got a leftist like us.
[00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:47.748]  But really, do they have a leftist like them?
[00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:50.669]  It was the same thing with Bush.
[00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.751]  Everybody thought it was going to be wonderful, and conservatives all went to sleep.
[00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:59.753]  But if you look, it is the exact policies, just different rhetoric, continuing.
[00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:02.474]  And there's this huge foundation for youth brigades.
[00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:07.357]  Bush took Clinton's AmeriCorps and set up SecurCorps with the youth.
[00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:13.062]  Sixth, seventh, and eighth grade with M-16s, training for gun confiscation.
[00:05:13.102 --> 00:05:14.423]  That was in major newspapers.
[00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:16.325]  Philadelphia Daily News was one.
[00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:22.111]  So this is all going on behind the scenes very quietly, but exactly.
[00:05:23.012 --> 00:05:29.699]  We have to shatter that left-right paradigm because they keep fooling us by changing horses, but I think, as you said earlier,
[00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:39.250]  One of the big things is they're afraid now because one of the things that Jim Tucker got out of the Trilateral Commission meeting a few months ago in D.C.
[00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.552]  and he had moles and got their minutes out.
[00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:43.735]  He has all those sources being in D.C.
[00:05:44.075 --> 00:05:47.559]  as a reporter now for 50 years and he's always proven to have accurate info.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.761]  They weren't worried about Ron Paul for president.
[00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:51.203]  They said he's got the youth.
[00:05:51.863 --> 00:05:55.566]  They're not getting into the communist groups or the right-wing groups, the fake right-wing groups.
[00:05:55.967 --> 00:05:58.729]  They are really getting into Liberty and they're talking about the Federal Reserve.
[00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.190]  And they are scared.
[00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.831]  And they're scared for a good reason.
[00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:05.655]  Because if we had more time, I know we could win this.
[00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:08.477]  The problem is the enemy sees we're coming at them and so they're moving quick.
[00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:14.780]  Well, with an economic catastrophe on the horizon.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.102]  Remember during the Great Depression, Roosevelt began his Civilian Conservation Corps, and much of that was youth.
[00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:26.122]  I believe this is what is going to take place.
[00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:45.152]  If Barack Obama is President, I believe he will be, unless some 9-11 event catapults John McCain into office, what we will see is this will be proposed to be one of the solutions for these millions of American youth who can't find a job.
[00:06:46.068 --> 00:06:47.169]  Who have no future.
[00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.013]  Who are out there driftless, because of economic calamity.
[00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:52.194]  You've been saying this for 15 years.
[00:06:52.234 --> 00:06:53.055]  You didn't just say this.
[00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:53.716]  Of course.
[00:06:54.156 --> 00:07:00.763]  And so, this will be the perfect thing for Obama to say, hey, youth of America, now I'm going to give you a purpose.
[00:07:00.903 --> 00:07:02.365]  I'm going to give you a goal.
[00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:04.727]  We're going to train you, indoctrinate you.
[00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:08.671]  You're going to be our youth core, our homeland security.
[00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:25.684]  And it just so happens that a trillion dollar platform has already been built over the last twenty years for him, but overnight he's got the idea and got all these bigwigs behind him in the Chicago Tribune saying this is... and they say, they don't say, oh it's mission will be helping people and some security.
[00:07:25.984 --> 00:07:28.426]  They say that there will be spies.
[00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:30.067]  Armed spies.
[00:07:30.147 --> 00:07:30.648]  Tex, go ahead.
[00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:44.536]  Well, they believe a generation that's been built, conditioned on video games like Grand Theft Auto and such, and barbaric movies, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and all these, they believe these people will be fit
[00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:53.377]  to run their gulag concentration camps that Halliburton and KBR have built systematically over the last ten years or so.
[00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:55.258]  So we have a generation.
[00:07:55.558 --> 00:08:01.902]  Now what we have to do is continue to educate people, inform people, and really rattle some cages.
[00:08:02.102 --> 00:08:03.262]  Hey Alex, I want to tell you something.
[00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:10.347]  This is just maybe symbolic, but it shows you the power of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:17.349]  You remember last week when we were on, we talked about these North American Union pyramids in West Virginia.
[00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:30.852]  Now remember, one of the things I'd like us to talk about today is the fact that the Illuminists in building this architecture around the world, this architectural colossus, are signaling future events.
[00:08:31.392 --> 00:08:32.652]  Now, we have in 2005 in Waco, Texas,
[00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:44.039]  The President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, Morton, the Prime Minister of Canada, and Bush agreeing to this pact, this North American Union, by 2010.
[00:08:44.379 --> 00:08:45.740]  Okay?
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.040]  This was in 2005.
[00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.582]  But wait!
[00:08:49.742 --> 00:09:01.990]  In 1995, in West Virginia, where the two Senators of that state, by the way, are Rockefeller, Jay Rockefeller, and Byrd, a 33rd degree Mason, they erected three pyramids.
[00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.191]  And they used U.S.
[00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:10.895]  taxpayer and West Virginia taxpayer money, and these three pyramids are symbolic.
[00:09:11.236 --> 00:09:12.276]  They are magical.
[00:09:12.436 --> 00:09:13.417]  They are ritual.
[00:09:13.437 --> 00:09:17.180]  And I believe they conducted rituals in those at their inauguration.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.482]  Well, we know it was laid down by Masons, so they do a ritual at Cornerstone.
[00:09:20.662 --> 00:09:24.705]  Now, they placed three flags in front of them that existed to this day.
[00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:26.466]  Now, here's a photo of that.
[00:09:26.506 --> 00:09:28.928]  I know your TV people can see it, but those on the radio.
[00:09:28.948 --> 00:09:40.495]  I want you to understand, here are three pyramids and the three flagpoles flying the Mexican, the Canadian, and the American flag in Princeton, West Virginia.
[00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:41.116]  Okay?
[00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:43.097]  Now, this is interesting.
[00:09:43.137 --> 00:09:44.878]  We went on your program and we exposed this.
[00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:48.161]  This was the first time this had ever been exposed.
[00:09:48.681 --> 00:09:53.304]  Remember, this presage, this was a precursor to the North American Union Pact.
[00:09:53.544 --> 00:09:54.185]  Well, guess what?
[00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:58.896]  A good friend of my ministry sent me a new picture.
[00:09:59.997 --> 00:10:11.924]  And because of the incredible commotion that your show caused, they have temporarily brought down the Mexican and Canadian flags, and the only one that exists right now is the U.S.
[00:10:12.104 --> 00:10:13.245]  This is a brand new photo.
[00:10:13.445 --> 00:10:14.626]  Yeah, this is a brand new photo.
[00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:15.006]  Same place.
[00:10:15.026 --> 00:10:16.587]  We just showed people all three of the flags.
[00:10:17.127 --> 00:10:19.349]  Now, again, they can only do this stuff in the dark.
[00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:23.332]  They can only do this if we don't expose it.
[00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:24.793]  One person wrote me an email.
[00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:31.979]  He said, Tex, what I did was, after I heard you with Alex Jones, I went to that place, and to my shock, it was true.
[00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:34.461]  There were the three flags flying.
[00:10:34.841 --> 00:10:40.506]  He said, I just got out of my car, I parked it, and I hoisted the two down, Mexican
[00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.527]  And he said, I didn't want to damage any property.
[00:10:42.547 --> 00:10:43.647]  I didn't want to get in any trouble.
[00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:44.447]  I love it.
[00:10:44.487 --> 00:10:45.707]  That's like Sons of Liberty.
[00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:46.448]  We're starting to get aggressive.
[00:10:46.468 --> 00:10:46.748]  Exactly.
[00:10:46.988 --> 00:10:51.469]  He said, and I folded them up very neatly and just set them down there on the sidewalk and left.
[00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:53.350]  Now, it's interesting.
[00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.151]  And then he said, I came back a week later and I took another picture.
[00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:56.511]  Guess what?
[00:10:56.531 --> 00:10:57.371]  They haven't put them back up.
[00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:05.633]  They're getting besieged with phone calls demanding to know why those foreign flags are in West Virginia at a government taxpayer-paid building.
[00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:07.674]  But remember, even the architecture
[00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:13.418]  You see, the pyramids are a sign of regeneration, of the new order of the ages.
[00:11:13.438 --> 00:11:14.179]  It's rising.
[00:11:14.479 --> 00:11:15.199]  It's rising.
[00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:19.423]  And in fact, when the Egyptians, every time a new dynasty came in, they would build new monuments to it.
[00:11:19.883 --> 00:11:23.646]  And it also indicates, symbolizes the death of the old.
[00:11:24.367 --> 00:11:26.909]  So, they were saying, death to America,
[00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:30.250]  And up with the North American Union.
[00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.511]  Which is also why they're building the big Muslim crescent moon and star.
[00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:37.252]  In fact, we're going to get to that when we get back.
[00:11:37.352 --> 00:11:43.274]  In fact, we'll just continue to talk during the break for presentplanet.tv viewers, but we'll come back with the main info in four minutes.
[00:11:43.574 --> 00:11:43.974]  Stay with us.
[00:11:46.383 --> 00:11:47.384]  Okay, John, thank you.
[00:11:47.645 --> 00:11:49.768]  We'll just coast back into the next segment.
[00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:52.171]  Oh, look at Burmess, how nice he is.
[00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:54.294]  With a jumbo, big gulp of water for you.
[00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:55.816]  Hey, Burmess, what do you think of the show?
[00:11:55.836 --> 00:11:56.076]  Good times.
[00:12:00.205 --> 00:12:01.365]  Jason Mermis is a good guy.
[00:12:01.385 --> 00:12:03.426]  Well, I'll tell you, he knows about 9-11, doesn't he?
[00:12:03.446 --> 00:12:04.146]  He studied that.
[00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:05.106]  He's going to get a lot of heat.
[00:12:05.126 --> 00:12:09.767]  You know, his new film that I decided to produce, a lot of it's about the Israelis.
[00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.648]  And boy, I tell you, I'm going to get into the deep water now.
[00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:21.530]  Well, you know, in Mysterious Monuments, I have a whole section on Rothschild's unholy legacy in the Holy Lands.
[00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:27.331]  Now, I want Jewish people to know, you know, in the last segment, a Jewish patriot called into the show.
[00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:29.316]  And I appreciated that, gentlemen.
[00:12:30.256 --> 00:12:30.876]  But guess what?
[00:12:31.536 --> 00:12:38.339]  I believe these folks, they don't care if Israelis suffer, if Palestinians suffer.
[00:12:38.739 --> 00:12:42.040]  In fact, I believe they want to bring tragedy to Israel.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.341]  They believe like the phoenix, they can build on the ashes.
[00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:55.025]  Well, have you seen those big reports about the top ten, first it was the top six, and the top ten billionaires left Israel, sold their houses, and moved to London.
[00:12:55.085 --> 00:12:56.145]  Why do you think they're leaving?
[00:12:56.565 --> 00:13:01.227]  Well, they're leaving because they know there can be an incredible blow-up there.
[00:13:01.608 --> 00:13:03.248]  And by the way, they don't mind that at all.
[00:13:04.489 --> 00:13:14.454]  One of their goals, of course, is to blow up the mosque there on top of the Temple Mount, the Dome of the Rock, and build a great Masonic temple of all religions.
[00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:16.715]  Well, I'm sure it's obviously in your books.
[00:13:16.815 --> 00:13:17.915]  Of course, the text has seen it.
[00:13:18.156 --> 00:13:20.577]  But they have the Supreme Court building with an all-seeing eye.
[00:13:21.317 --> 00:13:21.577]  That's right.
[00:13:21.597 --> 00:13:22.999]  That's just complete craziness.
[00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:33.469]  Remember, even in the Old Testament, and this is not a sermon today, but God told the Israelis, the Israelites, come out of Egypt.
[00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:42.178]  But the Rothschilds have built, at Hebrew University, right in the courtyard, and I picture that in the book, a great Egyptian pyramid.
[00:13:42.778 --> 00:13:57.012]  And this Supreme Court of Israel, that's intended to be the New World Order Supreme Court of the world, is built in all of these Egyptian, Pyramid, Masonic... They say the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:13:58.914 --> 00:14:10.080]  That they'll come out of Egypt means get rid of their religion, and that when Moses comes down with the law, they're all partying, having orgies with the golden calf, making sacrifices, and they all get blown to bits.
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.621]  But I mean, that's the same thing.
[00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:15.343]  There's always been those two groups within Israel, and that's the struggle.
[00:14:15.703 --> 00:14:22.488]  So we want Israel to be good and come out of Egypt, not continue to be the bearers of that evil from Egypt.
[00:14:22.648 --> 00:14:29.233]  Well, you know, authors like Barry Commission, I suspect he's been on this program for a while, he is a Jewish patriot.
[00:14:29.654 --> 00:14:37.940]  But remember, he says himself, he has reported the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.462]  All these things are done by this satanic Jewish sect.
[00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:43.004]  And by the way, even Billy Graham,
[00:14:43.755 --> 00:14:45.477]  You know, this came out in the Nixon tapes.
[00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:48.940]  He talked about the satanic sect among the Jews.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.761]  Here's the whole point of it.
[00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:53.544]  It doesn't matter whether you're Gentile or Jew.
[00:14:53.704 --> 00:14:55.846]  Do you serve the devil or do you serve God?
[00:14:55.966 --> 00:14:56.406]  Exactly.
[00:14:56.887 --> 00:15:04.894]  And to be very honest with you, one of my goals is to try to rescue as many people of Israel, just like the Palestinians.
[00:15:05.254 --> 00:15:08.458]  Well, I agree, and that's what I've always done, is expose the wickedness that's going on.
[00:15:08.878 --> 00:15:14.064]  I just don't hate the individuals, and that's why I get bullied around, because I make films about the U.S.'
[00:15:14.044 --> 00:15:16.987]  's liberty, I have guests constantly on, and they say, you don't cover this.
[00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:17.307]  No.
[00:15:17.728 --> 00:15:20.511]  What I do is I explain that Saudi Arabia is just as wicked.
[00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:29.797]  You know, I'm explaining there's evil in all high places instead of just focusing in on one, which is what the new order always wants us to do, another form of divide and conquer.
[00:15:30.057 --> 00:15:35.961]  It is divide and conquer, and yet it is true though, Alex, that the Zionist neocons right now are dominant.
[00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:38.003]  They are dominant in this new world order.
[00:15:39.124 --> 00:15:41.647]  And of course, this is going to bring great tragedy.
[00:15:41.827 --> 00:15:42.588]  Listen to this now.
[00:15:42.928 --> 00:15:44.891]  Not only to the United States, but to Israel.
[00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.633]  And that is planned.
[00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:49.535]  Before you leave, let's get into that on the full show.
[00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:52.399]  Coming back right now, let's continue with what you were talking about with the pyramids.
[00:15:55.302 --> 00:16:03.824]  I was telling you that in Mysterious Monuments, we have a whole section called Rothschild's Unholy Legacy in the Holy Lands.
[00:16:04.484 --> 00:16:14.446]  He's built a great pyramid in the courtyard of Hebrew University, and he's built the Israeli Supreme Court, an incredible complex.
[00:16:15.047 --> 00:16:20.188]  There again we have Egyptian pyramids and all kinds of Masonic numerology used therein.
[00:16:20.508 --> 00:16:21.028]  And by the way,
[00:16:21.628 --> 00:16:26.193]  When you come out of Egypt, the first city you come to there is called Eilat.
[00:16:26.654 --> 00:16:27.575]  E-I-L-A-T.
[00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:37.005]  And when you drive in, you will see a great pyramid right there in the middle of the street in the boulevard with the all-seeing eye and the Masonic square and compass.
[00:16:37.306 --> 00:16:40.049]  Here again we see signs of Rothschild.
[00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:43.971]  Rothschild, of course, was the designer of the Israeli flag in 1948.
[00:16:44.611 --> 00:16:47.673]  The six-pointed star, which is actually... The Seal of Solomon.
[00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:48.693]  The Seal of Solomon.
[00:16:48.713 --> 00:16:50.374]  It's the hexagram of witchcraft.
[00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:54.717]  666 is concealed within the six-pointed star.
[00:16:54.737 --> 00:16:58.579]  And that's the penultimate Kabbalic symbol, is it not?
[00:16:58.699 --> 00:16:58.999]  Oh, yes.
[00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:00.480]  And you know, the average person, you know...
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.201]  It doesn't matter.
[00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.261]  You may have a Jewish neighbor.
[00:17:03.281 --> 00:17:03.982]  You tell them about this.
[00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.142]  They don't know anything about this.
[00:17:05.162 --> 00:17:05.963]  They're not plotters.
[00:17:05.983 --> 00:17:07.204]  They're not conspirators.
[00:17:07.684 --> 00:17:11.967]  And I believe the people of Israel are going to be great victims of this.
[00:17:12.527 --> 00:17:17.010]  Because there is a satanic sect within the Zionist at the top.
[00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.231]  Just like in America.
[00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:21.072]  The average American is patriotic to the core.
[00:17:21.372 --> 00:17:23.814]  But we have this small clique, this cabal,
[00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:24.814]  Well, it's like the British.
[00:17:25.374 --> 00:17:27.975]  I mean, I've got an English name, you've got a Scottish name.
[00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:30.475]  The point is, the government's evil there.
[00:17:30.495 --> 00:17:32.816]  We're not talking about the evil communist Chinese.
[00:17:32.836 --> 00:17:34.356]  We're not saying the Chinese are bad.
[00:17:34.616 --> 00:17:36.257]  We're saying their leaders are wicked.
[00:17:36.297 --> 00:17:41.278]  And Israel is dominated by very, very wicked people, and they have now dominated the U.S.
[00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:45.579]  Now, some people say, well, is their goal to bring Judaism to the world scene?
[00:17:45.979 --> 00:17:46.219]  Listen.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:59.178]  Their world religion is based on acceptance of all religions, a melting of all religions into one, but you cannot say that your religion is exclusive or better.
[00:17:59.459 --> 00:18:00.420]  Let's just take this.
[00:18:01.345 --> 00:18:03.727]  This is an absolute disgrace.
[00:18:04.468 --> 00:18:18.640]  What I'm showing you here, and what is pictured in Mysterious Monuments, is the taxpayer-funded monument to the victims that died on 9-11, that aircraft that crashed there near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
[00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:25.607]  Now, they have built, listen to this, an Islamic monument
[00:18:28.144 --> 00:18:29.024]  It's an incredible thing.
[00:18:29.104 --> 00:18:33.686]  Remember, Arlen Specter is the senator that sort of greased this bill through Congress.
[00:18:33.706 --> 00:18:34.986]  And it even aims at Mecca.
[00:18:35.466 --> 00:18:37.046]  Well, it's oriented toward Mecca.
[00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:47.249]  And I show here, if you look at it, the crescent moon and the star, which is the sign of Islam, and they have designed it in the same kind of format.
[00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:50.870]  And by the way, even the name of it is called the Crescent of Embrace.
[00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.652]  What a slap in the face to the survivors!
[00:18:54.672 --> 00:19:00.618]  And they've got the visitor center, you have to be there to see it, but I know this is laid out, and it's been on the news, like a star right there.
[00:19:01.019 --> 00:19:03.121]  Like, you know, the red star of communism.
[00:19:03.641 --> 00:19:09.267]  But the crescent of embrace, because the Islamic symbol is the crescent moon.
[00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:12.210]  So here we have a slap in the face.
[00:19:13.191 --> 00:19:16.074]  How can they actually, and by the way, Arlen Specter is Jewish.
[00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:19.262]  But he is a 33rd degree Mason!
[00:19:19.843 --> 00:19:31.220]  And remember, it was Albert Pike, the former Sovereign Grand Commander of Freemasonry, who said, every Masonic temple, or lodge, is a temple of religion.
[00:19:31.903 --> 00:19:39.188]  But it is not the religion of either the Jews, or the Christians, or the Muslims, or the Hindus, but of the great architect.
[00:19:39.608 --> 00:19:40.108]  Lucifer.
[00:19:40.248 --> 00:19:41.909]  Yeah, all-seeing-eye God.
[00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:43.610]  They call him the great architect.
[00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.311]  He is, in fact, Lucifer.
[00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:47.873]  And their religion is manifesting it through building.
[00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:48.813]  Through building.
[00:19:48.874 --> 00:19:50.475]  They call themselves the builders.
[00:19:50.795 --> 00:19:58.900]  I have a picture of a well-known, in fact he's celebrated in all the Masonic lodges, and by the Supreme Lodge there in Washington, D.C.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.461]  Joseph Fort Newton.
[00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.063]  He wrote a book called The Builders.
[00:20:02.463 --> 00:20:11.912]  Did you know that the Freemasons actually claim that a Freemason named Peleg was the architect of the Tower of Babel?
[00:20:12.963 --> 00:20:13.884]  What a boast!
[00:20:13.904 --> 00:20:17.708]  They say, we, the masons, built the Tower of Babel!
[00:20:17.728 --> 00:20:28.758]  Well, that's like the European Union building is built exactly like that, and they even say that's what it's supposed to be, and then they have on their stamps and money, they have the image of upside-down stars flying over it.
[00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:29.738]  That's right.
[00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:35.243]  We have a picture here now, for your TV audience at least, but I want people to understand this.
[00:20:35.824 --> 00:20:37.766]  This is the new European
[00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:39.640]  See, it's not done.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.420]  Community building.
[00:20:40.921 --> 00:20:41.642]  Well, it is done.
[00:20:41.862 --> 00:20:43.844]  But I mean, I see what you mean, it's not done.
[00:20:43.904 --> 00:20:46.166]  But in the architecture, they're leaving it like the biblical images.
[00:20:46.466 --> 00:20:48.088]  Yeah, this is the Tower of Babel.
[00:20:48.348 --> 00:20:52.011]  Now, remember what I said about the Illuminati signaling future events.
[00:20:52.512 --> 00:20:55.054]  They build gigantic, monumental architecture.
[00:20:55.595 --> 00:21:00.219]  And remember, it takes many years to build such grandiose edifices.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.780]  But here we have
[00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:14.369]  In Europe, they have built this European Community Headquarters, and they have their 12-star flag out in front, and it is an unfinished Tower of Babel.
[00:21:14.389 --> 00:21:16.370]  They intend to finish the project.
[00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.013]  Well, I agree with you, and as you know, Tex, on their actual money, they put the ancient Tower of Babel.
[00:21:21.033 --> 00:21:27.137]  The European Union, on their handbills, has the ancient Tower of Babel in the biblical representation.
[00:21:27.177 --> 00:21:28.338]  Stay there, Tex, we'll be right back.
[00:21:35.248 --> 00:21:36.149]  We're on the march.
[00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.231]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:41.914]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:42.274 --> 00:21:43.335]  Alright, we're gonna keep going, John.
[00:21:46.465 --> 00:22:09.088]  We're here talking with Tex Mars and to explain to people on the web, they keep getting confused by this at PrisonPlanet.tv and then when people grab it and post it all over the internet, we have a live radio show in here and there's about fourteen minutes of ads an hour and so I don't want to waste time with somebody like Tex when he comes in so we will then talk behind the scenes so that you can also watch us
[00:22:10.179 --> 00:22:10.679]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.340]  Our email is going crazy.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.041]  Here's the reason why.
[00:22:38.699 --> 00:22:48.564]  So many people listen to your program, they listen to my program, they buy books and they buy videos, but what was missing perhaps?
[00:22:48.864 --> 00:22:50.665]  Because so many people are skeptics.
[00:22:51.045 --> 00:22:55.066]  So many people watch the control mass media and they're lied to and propagandized.
[00:22:55.967 --> 00:23:00.449]  But what Mysterious Monuments does for the first time is show that there is physical
[00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:02.761]  Forensic evidence.
[00:23:03.282 --> 00:23:03.942]  It's everywhere.
[00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:04.862]  It's like CSI.
[00:23:04.982 --> 00:23:06.243]  And it's not just what's in your book.
[00:23:06.323 --> 00:23:08.104]  Once they know the language, they see it everywhere.
[00:23:08.344 --> 00:23:15.487]  Oh yes, because this is an encyclopedia of secret Illuminati designs, Masonic architecture, and occult places.
[00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:18.888]  And what I do is show what all the symbology means.
[00:23:19.368 --> 00:23:20.749]  What is the numerology?
[00:23:20.849 --> 00:23:26.571]  Why is the Washington Monument, an Egyptian obelisk, exactly 555 feet tall?
[00:23:27.091 --> 00:23:29.032]  Well, it's because five is the number of
[00:23:29.832 --> 00:23:30.693]  Regeneration.
[00:23:31.274 --> 00:23:33.816]  And it's the number of the death of the old.
[00:23:34.657 --> 00:23:34.957]  You see?
[00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:37.359]  And the bringing in of the new order.
[00:23:37.939 --> 00:23:40.802]  So we have a triple witching, you might say, with 555.
[00:23:41.202 --> 00:23:46.867]  But in Houston, Texas, they're planning to build a great goddess statue.
[00:23:47.347 --> 00:23:48.969]  They call her the Spirit of Houston.
[00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:52.332]  And of course, she is a sex goddess.
[00:23:53.012 --> 00:23:56.573]  And she's exactly five hundred and fifty five feet tall.
[00:23:56.793 --> 00:23:58.354]  The same as the Washington Monument.
[00:23:58.754 --> 00:24:00.875]  So everything is done with numbers.
[00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:03.836]  And again I want to tell people, I want people to understand something.
[00:24:04.256 --> 00:24:14.059]  Sometimes this monumental architecture is inaugurated on an astrologically auspicious day, but also it has to go along with the numbers.
[00:24:14.099 --> 00:24:19.141]  For example, and by the way, usually when this architecture is begun,
[00:24:20.846 --> 00:24:23.967]  It begins a great period of bloodshed in human history.
[00:24:23.987 --> 00:24:24.987]  This is too important.
[00:24:25.007 --> 00:24:29.848]  Come back and recap and get into all this when we come back in about 15 seconds, Tex.
[00:24:29.908 --> 00:24:34.089]  This is so important and we'll show people all these great images that you're kind enough to show us.
[00:24:34.329 --> 00:24:35.529]  We have Tex Mars here with us.
[00:24:35.569 --> 00:24:39.290]  We're going back into the main transmission in T-minus 5 seconds.
[00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:39.650]  Here we go.
[00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.370]  344-3420 today.
[00:24:51.468 --> 00:24:56.412]  We are back live.
[00:24:56.792 --> 00:25:02.556]  I have run into quite a few Hollywood people over the years and a lot of prominent folks have really sought me out.
[00:25:02.576 --> 00:25:05.879]  And it happened once, it happened twice, it happened three times.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.003]  You hear about Ronald Reagan, what time he'd give a speech, what day he'd give a speech, what color tie.
[00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.325]  They would consult with three different astrologers.
[00:25:13.385 --> 00:25:16.668]  Tony Blair being possessed by the spirit of the light each morning.
[00:25:16.688 --> 00:25:18.169]  We talked about that a few weeks ago with Tex.
[00:25:18.989 --> 00:25:19.950]  And people couldn't believe it.
[00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.372]  They googled it and found all the mainstream news and freaked out.
[00:25:24.494 --> 00:25:26.315]  Times of London, BBC, you name it.
[00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:29.878]  But I don't put me stock in all that stuff.
[00:25:30.078 --> 00:25:30.999]  I know it's dangerous.
[00:25:31.059 --> 00:25:33.181]  I stay away from it, whether it's real or not, that whole culture.
[00:25:33.521 --> 00:25:34.442]  But you know, I was born on 2-11-74.
[00:25:36.323 --> 00:25:52.434]  And separately, I guess these globalists, I guess even the police when they're looking at you at high levels, they go and look at when you're born, and they do charts, and also the date, and the numerology, and when I had three separate prominent people go, I've looked into your date of birth, and you know, 2-11-74,
[00:25:54.895 --> 00:26:08.925]  And you put the 2 and the 11 together, and the 74 makes 11, and oh, this is the best number you can have for your birth, and then we did your chart, you know, we found out when you were born at 1 o'clock in the morning on this day when Mars was in the transit with this.
[00:26:09.145 --> 00:26:11.807]  But the point is, it's all gobbledygook, but they live it!
[00:26:11.867 --> 00:26:18.131]  They are literally obsessed, and that's the language they operate off of, and numerology.
[00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:19.772]  And behind the scenes, Tex was getting into it.
[00:26:20.072 --> 00:26:22.614]  Recap some of what you said, and then get more into it.
[00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:23.735]  Please, Tex Mars.
[00:26:24.235 --> 00:26:34.723]  Well, you know, Alex, I was thinking while you were talking about that, in World War II, British intelligence working with the OSS, which is the precursor of the CIA of the United States,
[00:26:35.518 --> 00:26:39.380]  Did the astrological chart on Adolf Hitler and Himmler.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.080]  Well, can you imagine here?
[00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:44.182]  We're in the midst of World War II, they're doing the astrological chart.
[00:26:44.362 --> 00:26:47.983]  They want to understand the personality of Hitler and Himmler.
[00:26:49.664 --> 00:26:53.566]  One of the things we have to understand is that the Illuminist elite
[00:26:54.814 --> 00:27:00.561]  How this monumental architecture, remember they are empire builders, and architecture is a great part of that.
[00:27:00.882 --> 00:27:03.805]  Hitler, for example, had his own personal architect.
[00:27:04.185 --> 00:27:11.975]  They say he spent more time than even war making and war planning with Albert Speer, his architect, and he had great drawings.
[00:27:11.995 --> 00:27:14.478]  Remember he considered himself a little bit of an artist architect.
[00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:17.471]  And so he had these fantastic plans.
[00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:20.633]  Stalin also had his architects all around him.
[00:27:21.534 --> 00:27:30.801]  They tore down one of the most famous churches, just raised it to the ground in Moscow, so they could build a great temple, you know, a great monument.
[00:27:30.821 --> 00:27:31.402]  To the Soviet man.
[00:27:31.662 --> 00:27:40.109]  Yeah, to the Soviet man with linen at the top, raising his hand and looking toward the prince of the power of the air, which the Bible says is Satan.
[00:27:41.122 --> 00:27:52.792]  And then Lennon, as I learned from you, and I went and found it in mainline history books, he was obsessed with Lucifer and blood and death and just a complete maniac, and like you said, go to an island and just murder little bunny rabbits?
[00:27:53.392 --> 00:27:54.793]  Oh, he was a monster.
[00:27:55.134 --> 00:27:56.515]  He kept calling for more blood.
[00:27:56.935 --> 00:27:59.777]  Here again we have the death situation.
[00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:03.480]  Let me give people a little picture of this.
[00:28:04.369 --> 00:28:17.301]  Now, this is, and I know this is the radio, but this is the great Maltese Temple of Blood that has been built in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic, off the coast of the United States.
[00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:21.424]  Now, this is the other part of, you know, Haiti is on one side, and there is Dominican Republic.
[00:28:21.885 --> 00:28:25.948]  They built this, and they began the planning for this, Alex, in 1939.
[00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.132]  Now, they had the foresight to build this thing.
[00:28:31.152 --> 00:28:35.394]  Remember, 1939 kicked off World War II, and they began the building.
[00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:40.697]  And the reason this was so important, remember, great bloodshed began.
[00:28:40.717 --> 00:28:43.698]  50 million people perished in World War II.
[00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:45.940]  They were planning this great temple.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:46.500]  Now, 1992,
[00:28:48.681 --> 00:28:50.223]  They had the grand opening of this.
[00:28:50.643 --> 00:28:51.604]  Everybody was there.
[00:28:51.704 --> 00:28:53.906]  Meanwhile, Bush is announcing 1,000 points of light.
[00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:57.289]  Simultaneously, all sorts of weird celebrations all over the world.
[00:28:57.309 --> 00:29:00.152]  The New Edgers are on top of mountains, calling in the New Age.
[00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:02.534]  The Harmonic Convergence and so forth.
[00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:05.096]  They were having the Great Earth Day situations.
[00:29:05.517 --> 00:29:06.718]  Now, what is this?
[00:29:06.858 --> 00:29:08.239]  It's a gigantic building.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.962]  It's many football fields long.
[00:29:11.662 --> 00:29:12.743]  It's bigger than the U.S.
[00:29:12.783 --> 00:29:13.623]  Capitol building.
[00:29:14.183 --> 00:29:16.885]  It's shaped like a great Mayan temple.
[00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:22.488]  In fact, there's a great Mayan pyramid on top of it with a gigantic laser light.
[00:29:22.528 --> 00:29:25.149]  They actually create the image of the beast in the sky.
[00:29:25.189 --> 00:29:27.711]  That shines out of the torch was another Illuminati symbol.
[00:29:28.051 --> 00:29:40.798]  Remember those Mayan temples and the millions of people who were sacrificed to the sun god, to Lucifer, in those Mayan, Incan, Aztec temples in Meso and South Central America.
[00:29:41.038 --> 00:29:43.179]  And I'm noticing, as you said, there's no windows in this.
[00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:52.624]  There's no window in this gigantic thing, but I understand that some people claim that there are many prison cells, many dungeons, torture centers in this.
[00:29:52.664 --> 00:29:55.366]  Now, when this first came to my attention,
[00:29:56.449 --> 00:30:14.519]  The report to me was that this is going to be used, people will be taken on jets, dissidents in America, okay, resistors to the New World Order, will be taken on jet aircraft, brought here, tortured and disposed of, and I said, no, no, that can't, why would they take people on jet aircraft?
[00:30:16.795 --> 00:30:17.656]  Can you believe it?
[00:30:18.136 --> 00:30:20.938]  Extraordinary rendition is the euphemism they used.
[00:30:21.479 --> 00:30:33.148]  We're picking up people who resist the New World Order, calling them potential terrorists, and we now have a system, according to European reports, 39 gulags around the world.
[00:30:33.368 --> 00:30:39.452]  I want to ask the question, is this Maltese Temple of Blood, inaugurated in 1992, was this not a precursor
[00:30:43.171 --> 00:30:51.399]  to what we have today two great wars uh... in the middle east maybe another one to come now everywhere you go the new york
[00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:55.353]  World Trade Centers were brought down, these two great towers.
[00:30:55.913 --> 00:31:04.216]  But prior to bringing them down, they erected four great towers with pyramidal structures on top.
[00:31:04.616 --> 00:31:08.857]  They call it the World Financial Center, and it sits right on the harbor at New York City.
[00:31:09.457 --> 00:31:14.519]  So they built four, each one being a corner of the world, the four corners of the world.
[00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:18.160]  Now why did they bring down the two World Trade Center towers?
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.720]  This was the signal.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.781]  This was the Illuminati's goal.
[00:31:22.441 --> 00:31:28.305]  They were saying it is the end of the American superiority in the World Financial Center.
[00:31:28.885 --> 00:31:37.151]  At the same time, they were planning to bring down the two World Trade Center towers, which would mean the end of American glory, you see.
[00:31:37.411 --> 00:31:38.612]  The end of the dollar.
[00:31:39.132 --> 00:31:48.519]  Over in Europe, they were building a great statue of the goddess, and she is holding up, and I have a picture of her in my book, she is holding up the Euro.
[00:31:49.531 --> 00:31:55.774]  And beneath her, in a supine, cowering, you know, admiring position, are the people of the world.
[00:31:56.054 --> 00:31:56.935]  This is a statue.
[00:31:57.015 --> 00:31:57.915]  About where is that?
[00:31:57.935 --> 00:31:58.716]  Because I remember seeing that.
[00:31:58.736 --> 00:31:59.356]  It's incredible.
[00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:05.139]  Yeah, this is on pages four, let's see, page fifty-seven.
[00:32:05.999 --> 00:32:07.060]  In Mysterious Monuments.
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.523]  There is the Euro Goddess, and look at her!
[00:32:11.983 --> 00:32:14.044]  You can see the picture, she's holding up the Euro!
[00:32:14.585 --> 00:32:17.487]  She's exalting the Euro among all the nations in the world.
[00:32:17.507 --> 00:32:22.650]  And then there's a pyramid structure made up of basically crushed people who are supine on their backs.
[00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:30.975]  And not only that, over in Berlin, Germany, they had a huge, and I have the headline in this book, I think that's page 40, 41, The Reichstag Reborn.
[00:32:34.235 --> 00:32:45.180]  But it's not just the old outside, it looks like the Reichstag, but inside they have a great inverse cone or pyramid down into the assembly.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:54.624]  And that channels all of the Prince of the Power there, all of the energy forces from the cosmic gods and goddesses into the German Reichstag.
[00:32:54.644 --> 00:32:59.326]  So they added that feature, that satanic feature to the architecture of the Reichstag.
[00:32:59.746 --> 00:33:00.927]  But here again we have
[00:33:01.087 --> 00:33:02.287]  And they have that in the Louvre, too.
[00:33:02.567 --> 00:33:04.248]  Pyramids on top, pyramids below.
[00:33:04.568 --> 00:33:13.891]  And then Francois Mitterrand said, I'm an occultist, and I've had this guy design it with 666 pieces of yellow-pink glass, and that this is a power talisman.
[00:33:14.351 --> 00:33:17.011]  He was in the news saying it was kind of a national thing.
[00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:17.792]  God, is he crazy?
[00:33:17.832 --> 00:33:18.912]  And they said, no.
[00:33:19.412 --> 00:33:21.794]  I have a whole lot on the architect, I.M.
[00:33:22.374 --> 00:33:23.915]  Pye, Chinese-American.
[00:33:24.195 --> 00:33:26.497]  By the way, he's doing a lot of projects in Red China today.
[00:33:27.477 --> 00:33:30.960]  He also, I think he was the designer of the Kennedy Center.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.721]  But I.M.
[00:33:32.801 --> 00:33:35.483]  Pye specializes in pyramids.
[00:33:36.243 --> 00:33:40.946]  And he did build, and it's odd to see this ancient King Louis XIV.
[00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:50.575]  The Louvre Museum, and right in front of it is an Egyptian pyramid of crystal glass.
[00:33:51.256 --> 00:34:05.030]  But it's interesting that Mitterrand, according to Le Monde, that's the Paris newspaper of the world in English, Mitterrand went to the top of a sacred mountain in the Pyrenees.
[00:34:06.019 --> 00:34:09.200]  And there he beat on drums and sat lotus-legged.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.800]  And remember, this is the president of France!
[00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:18.322]  He has the ability to destroy much of the world with the nuclear weapons of France.
[00:34:18.342 --> 00:34:19.782]  So they've got more than a thousand nukes.
[00:34:20.082 --> 00:34:24.243]  And he beat the drums to evoke the spirits to come forth.
[00:34:24.583 --> 00:34:27.064]  And they instructed him to build a Great Pyramid.
[00:34:27.504 --> 00:34:33.425]  Now this is no different than an American, a billionaire named Isaac Tigrett, who went to the Great Pyramid
[00:34:34.506 --> 00:34:44.359]  In Egypt, and spent the night in the Pharaoh's King's Chamber, in the very middle, and at the stroke of midnight, according to his testimony.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.544]  By the way, I have a picture of Isaac Tegret in this book.
[00:34:48.104 --> 00:34:48.805]  Isaac Tegret.
[00:34:49.506 --> 00:34:55.732]  Says, a great light came, and a voice said to him, build a pyramid like this in the United States.
[00:34:56.292 --> 00:35:05.341]  So we went to the sister city of Memphis, which is Memphis, Memphis, Egypt, Memphis, Tennessee, and he built the Great American Pyramid.
[00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:06.081]  What page is that, Tex?
[00:35:06.101 --> 00:35:07.443]  I want to show them that, it's amazing.
[00:35:08.263 --> 00:35:11.426]  I don't remember the page of that, but it's probably in the first 50 pages that I remember.
[00:35:11.446 --> 00:35:12.527]  624 pages, it sort of sometimes escapes me.
[00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:21.992]  There's so much here, but I believe you'll see on the right-hand side there a picture of Isaac Tegret.
[00:35:22.612 --> 00:35:28.074]  Isaac Tegret is the founder of Hard Rock Cafes, the chain.
[00:35:29.094 --> 00:35:32.695]  And he, of course, worships Sai Baba, the Hindu guru, and so forth.
[00:35:33.276 --> 00:35:35.696]  But he also owned the Phoenix Suns.
[00:35:35.776 --> 00:35:36.637]  Now get that Sun.
[00:35:36.657 --> 00:35:40.058]  Remember the Sun God motif of the ancient mystery religions?
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.264]  I have pictured the t-shirt they sell, and I've seen young people wearing this t-shirt.
[00:35:46.665 --> 00:35:49.367]  It says Hard Rock Cafe, and then it's the sun.
[00:35:49.928 --> 00:35:51.109]  Just an image of the sun.
[00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:53.091]  Here again, we get to this sun god.
[00:35:53.411 --> 00:35:55.012]  By the way, here's something else.
[00:35:55.032 --> 00:35:57.154]  If you want to talk about the Harbinger, there we go.
[00:35:57.415 --> 00:35:58.335]  There you see the picture.
[00:35:58.696 --> 00:36:00.537]  By the way, this is American Airlines Magazine.
[00:36:01.438 --> 00:36:07.142]  And I was flying somewhere and, wow, there on the front cover is the Great American Pyramid.
[00:36:07.162 --> 00:36:13.026]  See, he's telling us, it says hip and holy is the American Airlines Magazine and they're telling you this is religious.
[00:36:13.667 --> 00:36:17.749]  American Airlines is saying this is a holy, these pyramids are religious, baby.
[00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:18.710]  That's right.
[00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.591]  And there's the government.
[00:36:19.971 --> 00:36:21.632]  Look at the t-shirt here on the left-hand side.
[00:36:21.932 --> 00:36:22.653]  This is an ad.
[00:36:23.093 --> 00:36:25.755]  I got it out of the Minneapolis Magazine and look what it says at the top.
[00:36:26.315 --> 00:36:26.876]  Revolution.
[00:36:27.076 --> 00:36:27.596]  Anarchy.
[00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:28.197]  Rebellion.
[00:36:29.337 --> 00:36:30.518]  Bring the whole family!
[00:36:30.558 --> 00:36:32.058]  Bring the whole family, oh yeah!
[00:36:32.738 --> 00:36:56.906]  By the way, the interesting thing about this Great Pyramid is that rumors began when this was built that Isaac Tegret, this billionaire, owner of the Phoenix Suns, this is one of the richest guys in America, that Isaac Tegret had had the engineers and the builders to place a small sealed metal box right at the very apex
[00:36:58.185 --> 00:37:00.246]  Way up at the top, hundreds and hundreds of feet up.
[00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:05.607]  And it was rumored that that building was dedicated to the devil by Isaac Tegret.
[00:37:05.887 --> 00:37:11.348]  Now, the city fathers, this rumor got so big in Memphis, they were afraid nobody would come to the pyramid.
[00:37:11.388 --> 00:37:16.349]  They were going to have all these athletic games and so forth, and there was going to be a rock and roll museum there.
[00:37:16.689 --> 00:37:19.410]  So they said, what are we going to do to get the people to come to this?
[00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.871]  They're afraid that it's been dedicated to the devil in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:24.851]  So they made fun of it.
[00:37:25.012 --> 00:37:26.032]  Now listen to this, Alex.
[00:37:26.292 --> 00:37:26.972]  They made fun.
[00:37:27.012 --> 00:37:31.853]  They said, can you believe these crazy people out there, conspiracy theorists, are claiming this was dedicated to the devil?
[00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:38.015]  They're claiming there was a strange box that was planted at the very top and welded down.
[00:37:38.475 --> 00:37:40.016]  So they made a big deal of it.
[00:37:40.056 --> 00:37:41.296]  The mayor and the city council.
[00:37:41.376 --> 00:37:42.076]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:37:42.536 --> 00:37:47.638]  And they sent their engineers up with the newspapers, the cameras moving in the local channels.
[00:37:48.178 --> 00:37:48.738]  Guess what?
[00:37:49.478 --> 00:37:51.019]  They said, we're going to show you there's nothing there.
[00:37:51.079 --> 00:37:52.339]  They found the box.
[00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:58.241]  They took welding torches, they brought it down, they opened it up, and boy, they were shocked!
[00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:00.625]  There was a velvet patch in there!
[00:38:01.403 --> 00:38:02.524]  Or, I'm sorry, a bag.
[00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:05.186]  They opened up the bag and there were artifacts.
[00:38:05.946 --> 00:38:07.768]  Obviously, talismans, charms.
[00:38:08.288 --> 00:38:14.953]  It had been dedicated to his gods, just as had been rumored by the builders of that pyramid.
[00:38:15.053 --> 00:38:25.100]  Well, just like we told you, in West Virginia they had the North American Union obelisk and the pyramids and the flags and there it is, folks.
[00:38:26.645 --> 00:38:28.026]  Again, a lot of atheists out there.
[00:38:28.046 --> 00:38:30.487]  The New World Order trains people to not believe in the spiritual.
[00:38:30.867 --> 00:38:34.369]  But that's only because they want them to be blind so that they can control them.
[00:38:34.809 --> 00:38:44.374]  But when you get into it, I don't know a globalist who isn't completely obsessed and who in their writings doesn't admit that they're basically flopping around daily being possessed by entities.
[00:38:44.414 --> 00:38:45.054]  They believe it.
[00:38:45.374 --> 00:38:46.715]  Whether they're schizophrenic or not,
[00:38:47.645 --> 00:38:52.967]  And as you said, they now say that their gods are telling them to kill almost everyone on Earth.
[00:38:53.527 --> 00:38:56.908]  And so I want to get into their world population reduction, and then go back through your other notes.
[00:38:56.928 --> 00:38:58.748]  We've got about 45 minutes left with you, Tex.
[00:38:59.169 --> 00:39:10.092]  You really have gotten into their documents, their plans, how they created that special forces group that's job was to, quote, be the beast and the Earth force to kill everybody.
[00:39:10.112 --> 00:39:11.512]  Yeah, the Earth Battalion.
[00:39:11.772 --> 00:39:12.613]  Yeah, the first Earth Battalion.
[00:39:12.633 --> 00:39:13.993]  Colonel Jim Shannon's Earth Battalion.
[00:39:14.153 --> 00:39:18.071]  Yeah, and then now they've announced, and right here at Office Depot in town...
[00:39:20.776 --> 00:39:21.537]  Two stories now.
[00:39:21.577 --> 00:39:22.577]  We put photos up there.
[00:39:22.697 --> 00:39:25.519]  It says you've got to park around back if you've got an SUV.
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.060]  And they come out and tow you.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.523]  And then it says this is dedicated to the earth and this is for the earth and this is this and that.
[00:39:31.543 --> 00:39:32.984]  And of course it all sounds reasonable.
[00:39:33.284 --> 00:39:37.567]  Meanwhile they're the ones destroying the earth with all the toxic waste and GMO and the rest of it.
[00:39:38.688 --> 00:39:42.491]  And they're now inculcating us with an anti-human, pro-death view.
[00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:46.613]  And I wanted to let people understand that that's what's guiding all of this.
[00:39:46.633 --> 00:39:48.995]  And I wanted you to speak to that and some of their monuments to death.
[00:39:49.595 --> 00:39:58.941]  You know, back in the 18th century, the French Revolution, the Illuminists, of course, engendered that incredible bloody thing with the guillotines and so forth.
[00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:03.143]  But they said, we're inaugurating an age of reason.
[00:40:03.443 --> 00:40:06.485]  And they claimed that they worshipped a god of reason.
[00:40:06.825 --> 00:40:09.427]  Not the god of the other religions, but a new god.
[00:40:09.947 --> 00:40:15.110]  The great architect who would build a great new order of the ages, the God of Reason.
[00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:21.314]  Now on page 21 of Mysterious Monuments, I have a picture of the Georgia Guidestones.
[00:40:22.094 --> 00:40:23.415]  Now this is something that I visited.
[00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:26.557]  Here are these, it's almost like an American Stonehenge.
[00:40:28.756 --> 00:40:40.320]  I went there and I saw they had a great bronze plaque, and it's written in eight different languages, including English, French, Babylonian, cuneiform, back to Babylon,
[00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:46.114]  And they said, let these be guidestones to an age of reason.
[00:40:46.515 --> 00:40:48.175]  Now remember, this is a new thing.
[00:40:49.036 --> 00:40:49.876]  Remember what I said?
[00:40:50.276 --> 00:40:55.319]  That the Illuminati elite signal future events through architecture.
[00:40:55.859 --> 00:41:00.181]  They built these Georgia Guidestones near the little town of Eberton, Georgia.
[00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:02.282]  They spent many millions of dollars
[00:41:03.138 --> 00:41:11.361]  And the first of the Ten Guides, these replace the Ten Commandments, you see, for this new environmental world order.
[00:41:12.141 --> 00:41:22.265]  The first one says that the world must be reduced to 500 million people so that mankind will be in harmony
[00:41:23.163 --> 00:41:25.044]  Perpetually with nature.
[00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:35.391]  Now since there are seven billion people on this planet, all they have to do is massacre six and a half billion to make it sustainable.
[00:41:35.431 --> 00:41:36.832]  They use the word sustainable.
[00:41:37.332 --> 00:41:40.995]  And they say five hundred million is the most this planet can sustain.
[00:41:41.115 --> 00:41:44.297]  And now the Pope came out today and said we must be sustainable.
[00:41:44.817 --> 00:41:50.921]  All the other big, they've had both Pat Robertson and Al Sharpton get together and say we agree.
[00:41:50.981 --> 00:41:51.682]  Newt Gingrich
[00:41:52.302 --> 00:42:01.029]  I had a good friend the other day, where she worked, she mentioned that she didn't believe in global warming.
[00:42:18.493 --> 00:42:24.895]  And a lady that worked there, right, and they've been friends for years, in the desk next door, got up and screamed at her.
[00:42:25.615 --> 00:42:27.456]  How dare you not believe in global warming?
[00:42:27.816 --> 00:42:28.756]  You're a monster!
[00:42:29.516 --> 00:42:32.557]  And started calling her names, and it was like religious fervor.
[00:42:33.037 --> 00:42:33.678]  How dare you?
[00:42:34.078 --> 00:42:35.438]  You must believe in global warming.
[00:42:36.078 --> 00:42:41.560]  Don't you understand we've got to save the planet, we've got to save... Well, they're now saying in the US and England that we need to be arrested.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.021]  We'll talk behind the scenes more about this right now.
[00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.672]  Yeah, Tex, that is the incredible part about this.
[00:42:50.892 --> 00:42:55.876]  I'm not getting this from myself looking at it and guessing.
[00:42:55.916 --> 00:43:02.620]  They say that they're going to control our lives, micromanage everything we do, how much resources we can have on a card.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.401]  That will also track everything we do.
[00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:22.777]  And then it also hijacks any sensible environmental stuff, toxic waste, nuclear reactors in the ocean, the genetically cross-species chimeras that are giving rise to super viruses, things that really can hurt the earth, the grey goo type scenario, nanotech, all of that.
[00:43:23.417 --> 00:43:24.818]  None of that is an issue.
[00:43:25.479 --> 00:43:30.823]  The only thing that we're being told that matters now is that we just not question
[00:43:32.014 --> 00:43:35.735]  And we will buy our carbon credits from the federal government of each nation.
[00:43:35.835 --> 00:43:37.435]  We'll buy them from the private bankers.
[00:43:37.935 --> 00:43:42.397]  This is what the bankers said in the Club of Rome documents in 1992, Richard N. Haas, now head of the CFR.
[00:43:42.437 --> 00:43:55.820]  He said, this will control all resources and all energy, and all animal life will basically be under our control, and it, quote, makes humanity the enemy, and the state will prosecute operations against the enemy.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.961]  So, even if you believe man-made global warming is real and carbon is bad, which it isn't,
[00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:01.201]  You know, plants breathe it.
[00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:03.102]  They put out oxygen animals breathe.
[00:44:05.543 --> 00:44:13.947]  This Kyoto deal and the carbon credits will only transfer it to India and Mexico and China and a hundred plus other countries.
[00:44:13.987 --> 00:44:17.108]  And studies actually show it will radically increase it.
[00:44:17.408 --> 00:44:20.389]  But then you tell that to the environmentalists and they just go, No!
[00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:21.070]  No!
[00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:21.130]  No!
[00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:21.670]  No!
[00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.771]  I mean, it is... and see, they don't care about the environment.
[00:44:24.891 --> 00:44:26.252]  It is their cult.
[00:44:26.572 --> 00:44:28.513]  They were taught there is no religion, but
[00:44:29.113 --> 00:44:30.915]  Humans have a place in themselves for that.
[00:44:31.376 --> 00:44:37.603]  And so they've now been given the false religion, thinking it's humanism, when it's really anti-humanism.
[00:44:37.643 --> 00:44:38.645]  Can you speak to that, Tex?
[00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:57.803]  Well, five minutes of research, just Google it up, you'll find that the four top weather tracking scientific stations on this planet, the four top, including NASA, all say we have gone into an era of global cooling, and it's just a cyclical thing.
[00:44:58.223 --> 00:45:00.264]  We started cooling ten years ago.
[00:45:00.324 --> 00:45:02.666]  That's right, and so we're in a period of global cooling.
[00:45:02.946 --> 00:45:05.348]  That's why, of course, the environmental crazies,
[00:45:06.788 --> 00:45:08.969]  No longer really use global warming very much.
[00:45:09.029 --> 00:45:15.252]  They change the name to climate change, or earth changes, because they know now they're going to sound more and more like idiots.
[00:45:15.352 --> 00:45:21.094]  And Club of Rome first said ice age in the 60s, then it was global warming, and now it's climate change.
[00:45:21.254 --> 00:45:28.737]  In 86, 87, 88 era, in Colorado, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and others met, okay, with world leaders.
[00:45:28.797 --> 00:45:29.518]  Maury Strong, right?
[00:45:29.558 --> 00:45:30.418]  That's right, the Maury Strong.
[00:45:30.418 --> 00:45:32.419]  We're coming back to the main transmission.
[00:45:32.459 --> 00:45:32.759]  Stay there.
[00:45:32.779 --> 00:45:35.040]  I want to hear about this with Tex Marsh right now.
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:38.061]  Get a little bit of behind the scenes when we've got a full radio audience.
[00:45:38.281 --> 00:45:39.081]  I just want to warn them.
[00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:41.162]  And see, we've got so much more knowledge.
[00:45:41.222 --> 00:45:42.883]  I'm not interrupting Tex to be obnoxious.
[00:45:43.183 --> 00:45:45.384]  I want to add to what he's saying and back him up.
[00:45:45.784 --> 00:45:48.665]  I neurotically like to finish his sentences to show people out there watching.
[00:45:48.885 --> 00:45:50.345]  We're not making this up, folks.
[00:45:50.365 --> 00:45:51.146]  We've done the research.
[00:45:51.186 --> 00:45:51.526]  It's real.
[00:45:51.726 --> 00:45:52.086]  Here we go.
[00:45:54.087 --> 00:45:56.808]  Alright, before we go any further.
[00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:03.852]  I want all of you to know that we're opening the phones up in the next hour for 30 minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:03.872 --> 00:46:05.432]  I'm going to take a lot of calls for TexMars.
[00:46:05.452 --> 00:46:05.632]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:05.672 --> 00:46:06.272]  TexMars is coming up.
[00:46:06.312 --> 00:46:09.533]  Questions about specifically the New World Order, what they're doing.
[00:46:09.573 --> 00:46:12.834]  We were just now talking about the phony environmental movement.
[00:46:21.637 --> 00:46:33.450]  Meanwhile, the globalists are destroying the earth and want to build a new one, but how it is a cult, and they admit that this is a social unification tool in their own papers, admitting it's all fake.
[00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:40.938]  It's just cynical and evil, and while you're busy trying to ban carbon and tax yourself, they're going to go on genetic engineering and doing things that are really bad.
[00:46:41.338 --> 00:46:41.779]  Tex Mars.
[00:46:42.279 --> 00:46:43.880]  Well, back to the Georgia Guidestones.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:47:03.309]  Here we have the Illuminist signaling the future of mankind, which is a catastrophe, which will mean the wipeout of six and a half billion people off this planet, so they can reach their reasonable goal of five hundred million sustainable population.
[00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:06.170]  So they have this in stone, amazingly.
[00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.412]  Here we have the forensic evidence of that.
[00:47:09.972 --> 00:47:33.141]  So, by the way, if we go forward, I want to mention, too, as we were on the break, we were talking about, back in the late 1980s, in Colorado, Maurice Strong, head of the United Nations Environmental Program, met with the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, and others, and there at Crestone, Colorado, they came up with the idea for the World Conservation Bank.
[00:47:34.922 --> 00:47:39.143]  And all of the nations of the world would put in all of their wilderness areas and everything.
[00:47:40.143 --> 00:47:54.067]  And by the way, the interesting thing about this is we then began this great process of internationalizing all of America's wilderness areas and national parks with the United Nations biospheres.
[00:47:54.387 --> 00:47:57.167]  And people didn't believe it, but we got the treaty agreements.
[00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:59.328]  It was a handover of that, but not just that.
[00:47:59.608 --> 00:48:04.109]  The buffer zones, and now those are all the areas they're grabbing and setting off limits.
[00:48:04.249 --> 00:48:07.111]  That's right, because nature is to be the great world religion.
[00:48:07.431 --> 00:48:09.612]  But who is the god of nature?
[00:48:09.713 --> 00:48:10.513]  Nature's god?
[00:48:10.533 --> 00:48:12.995]  Well, it's Pan, the horned god of the forest.
[00:48:13.035 --> 00:48:16.517]  Here again, everything goes back to these devils.
[00:48:16.677 --> 00:48:33.828]  And by the way, to indicate that, to indicate that that was the future of the world, is Pan, the horned god of witchcraft, in London, England, in Hyde Park, which is sort of like New York Central Park, they have built a great statue of Pan, the horned devil god.
[00:48:35.276 --> 00:48:39.342]  A man named Epstein was the sculptor, and underneath it there's a bronze plaque.
[00:48:39.382 --> 00:48:49.797]  Now imagine, go to London, England, go to Hyde Park, and there you have a great devil goat god statue, and underneath it says, Family of Man.
[00:48:50.936 --> 00:48:52.037]  Family of man!
[00:48:52.057 --> 00:48:55.759]  He's head of the family of man, according to the Illuminist!
[00:48:56.839 --> 00:48:59.841]  And by the way, go to the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.
[00:48:59.861 --> 00:49:00.761]  and have pictures of it.
[00:49:01.042 --> 00:49:03.243]  You'll also find devils.
[00:49:03.443 --> 00:49:04.784]  There's a devil god.
[00:49:04.824 --> 00:49:09.306]  I think that's pages 388, 389 of Mysterious Monuments.
[00:49:09.666 --> 00:49:10.607]  Even Darth Vader!
[00:49:11.087 --> 00:49:18.050]  Because the Book of Daniel, the Bible says, the last day's ruler, world king, the Antichrist, will be the god of forces.
[00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:20.792]  And there we have old Darth Vader in stone!
[00:49:21.212 --> 00:49:25.054]  It's a little comedic in a way, and yet it's symbolic.
[00:49:25.074 --> 00:49:27.755]  Well, they know it's funny for the public, but then it's not for everybody else.
[00:49:27.935 --> 00:49:42.142]  Now imagine, here we have a great gothic cathedral, the National Cathedral, where they had the 9-11, you know, interfaith memorial service with all the presidents and religious leaders, and there's Doroth Vader looking down on people.
[00:49:42.902 --> 00:49:51.546]  But you can't see him, you've got to have a telephoto lens, because these demons and devils are all up on the ledges in stone, looking down on pastors by.
[00:49:53.723 --> 00:49:56.044]  I want to get back to this North American Union thing.
[00:49:56.824 --> 00:50:00.205]  What other ways have they signaled... Okay, let's stay there.
[00:50:00.225 --> 00:50:04.086]  We've got a one-minute break, and then we're going to come in again to the North American Union and take calls.

[00:51:52.949 --> 00:51:55.090]  I want to come back in the next segment and go directly to your calls.
[00:51:55.530 --> 00:52:00.332]  Michael, Jeffy, and many others that are holding 1-800-259-9231.
[00:52:00.372 --> 00:52:03.853]  We are live, 17th day of July 2008.
[00:52:04.273 --> 00:52:07.194]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are my websites.
[00:52:07.634 --> 00:52:12.536]  Text websites, of course, are TextMars.com, PowerOfProphecy.com, ConspiracyWorld.com.
[00:52:14.697 --> 00:52:17.040]  New book, he's got out of the encyclopedic in size.
[00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.523]  Very, very important.
[00:52:18.983 --> 00:52:22.909]  And we hope that you will get a copy of it as I hold it up for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:52:23.249 --> 00:52:24.130]  Mysterious Monuments.
[00:52:24.431 --> 00:52:27.976]  Okay, how are they heralding and bringing in their North American Union?
[00:52:29.363 --> 00:52:32.886]  Three North American Union pyramids, a structure they built.
[00:52:33.206 --> 00:52:41.592]  But interestingly enough, remember, a facet of this North American Union is the ending of American sovereignty, the bringing in of a new currency, the Amaro.
[00:52:42.133 --> 00:52:45.175]  Now they have actually built an entire new U.S.
[00:52:45.335 --> 00:52:47.177]  Mint in Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:52:47.817 --> 00:52:51.841]  And here are the pictures of it for your TV site.
[00:52:52.262 --> 00:52:53.202]  Here again, what do we have?
[00:52:53.242 --> 00:52:57.407]  We have a great circle indicating the whole world falls under the sway of what?
[00:52:57.767 --> 00:52:59.228]  Well, the men of the pyramid.
[00:52:59.569 --> 00:53:01.190]  The pyramid is in the very center.
[00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:04.053]  So that's the all-seeing eye above the world, architecturally is what that means.
[00:53:04.053 --> 00:53:08.154]  That's right, here's an aerial view, and both of these shots, by the way, are in mysterious monuments.
[00:53:08.754 --> 00:53:12.476]  Here we have, notice the Great Pyramid on top of the Circle of the World.
[00:53:12.876 --> 00:53:16.117]  This is where I believe the Amaro is going to be printed.
[00:53:16.677 --> 00:53:18.197]  Everything must be made new.
[00:53:18.557 --> 00:53:22.359]  This is between, on the freeway between Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas.
[00:53:23.199 --> 00:53:26.240]  I went there, I took some of these pictures, and by the way, I did some research.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.745]  And I called and talked to the architectural office that designed this building.
[00:53:32.046 --> 00:53:35.930]  And I said, by the way, the architect in charge, might he have been a Freemason?
[00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:36.630]  And they said, yes.
[00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:37.451]  How did you know?
[00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:40.875]  And he designed this building on Masonic principles.
[00:53:41.155 --> 00:53:44.098]  That's what they told me at the U.S.
[00:53:44.759 --> 00:53:46.260]  Office of Bureau of Engraving.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.682]  They don't even hide it.
[00:53:47.822 --> 00:53:49.143]  No, they thought it was a great idea.
[00:53:49.984 --> 00:53:57.309]  And by the way, they said that they wanted an actual all-seeing eye there at the gate, but for some reason management said no to that.
[00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:01.552]  So they got all, everything, I guess they got a little bit too much.
[00:54:01.873 --> 00:54:04.735]  So the Amaro, a new U.S.
[00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:05.855]  printing, tell folks about this.
[00:54:06.716 --> 00:54:10.638]  All right, now we talk about the greatest sex cult in the world.
[00:54:10.918 --> 00:54:17.360]  Now, I know this is vulgar, this is grotesque, but these men actually believe in sexual ritual.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:20.102]  You've got the breasts right here, you've got the phallus.
[00:54:20.442 --> 00:54:23.923]  Well, this is the new state capital of the state of Florida.
[00:54:23.943 --> 00:54:27.605]  Remember, Jeb Bush was the governor when this thing was built.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.141]  And architectural.
[00:54:30.361 --> 00:54:38.491]  Now architects themselves, one of the most popular websites, chose this as the most sexual piece of architecture in the world.
[00:54:39.132 --> 00:54:40.614]  It's the state capital of Florida.
[00:54:40.834 --> 00:54:41.294]  And what is it?
[00:54:41.435 --> 00:54:43.878]  It's the man's testicles and the man's phallus.
[00:54:44.982 --> 00:54:46.963]  Now, can you believe the state capital of Florida?
[00:54:47.023 --> 00:54:48.684]  Because they can say that's breast too.
[00:54:48.724 --> 00:54:50.225]  Yeah, but it's the testicles.
[00:54:50.305 --> 00:54:51.966]  And they admit this.
[00:54:52.026 --> 00:54:52.866]  It's real funny to them.
[00:54:52.886 --> 00:54:54.167]  It's a sex cult.
[00:54:54.787 --> 00:54:55.868]  Well, it is a sex cult.
[00:54:56.028 --> 00:55:03.071]  And their dominance in sex, they believe in killing the majority of us so we can't procreate, because that's magical to them.
[00:55:03.412 --> 00:55:05.373]  So it's also a great greediness to kill you.
[00:55:05.633 --> 00:55:11.316]  There is a sex ritual, of course, in such secret societies as the Bohemian Grove, the Order of Skull and Bone.
[00:55:11.336 --> 00:55:13.317]  Oh, by the way, speak of the devil, that's going on right now.
[00:55:14.372 --> 00:55:16.013]  Oh yeah, the Beeman Groves.
[00:55:16.194 --> 00:55:18.616]  They're down there worshipping their great owl that you exposed.
[00:55:18.816 --> 00:55:22.379]  And having man-on-man intercourse.
[00:55:22.839 --> 00:55:24.200]  Yeah, that's a terrible thing.
[00:55:24.481 --> 00:55:28.124]  But even the fifteen young men initiated in the Order of Skull and Bones.
[00:55:28.464 --> 00:55:34.889]  In Mysterious Monuments, I actually show the original layout of the city of New Haven.
[00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:38.452]  Now remember, the word New Haven means the New Heaven.
[00:55:39.193 --> 00:55:42.734]  This is where the educational center of the world was going to be.
[00:55:43.194 --> 00:55:43.914]  Would you believe?
[00:55:44.034 --> 00:55:48.115]  Well, Mason's founded Niederwald, which means Underworld outside Austin, but sorry, go ahead.
[00:55:48.375 --> 00:55:55.576]  Well, here we have, and by the way, this is a 1797, dated 1797, a drawing of the city plan.
[00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:59.397]  It shows a nine square city, because concealed in the number nine is 666.
[00:56:00.918 --> 00:56:02.638]  But in the very center of the city,
[00:56:03.689 --> 00:56:06.010]  They show it will be the town cemetery.
[00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:14.414]  The center is the center of death of New Haven, Connecticut, where Yale University... Well, they also admit, Yale admits the town, the university is laid out as a skull and crossbones.
[00:56:14.814 --> 00:56:15.674]  It is.
[00:56:15.714 --> 00:56:21.517]  You will see in the original layout, you will see a skull and bones, and this comes from the book
[00:56:22.197 --> 00:56:25.038]  It is the diary of Ezra Stiles.
[00:56:25.098 --> 00:56:30.320]  He was a high-level Freemason, and he was one of the first presidents of Yale College.
[00:56:30.861 --> 00:56:33.582]  And he actually showed, here is our city.
[00:56:34.302 --> 00:56:38.944]  And by the way, right next to the town cemetery is the tomb
[00:56:39.884 --> 00:56:43.505]  The resident for the Skull and Bones for the 50 young men initiated.
[00:56:43.605 --> 00:56:45.505]  A devil cult runs our society.
[00:56:45.525 --> 00:56:47.345]  We're going to keep talking here in the break, guys.
[00:56:47.365 --> 00:56:48.586]  We're going to keep going here.
[00:56:48.886 --> 00:56:50.846]  I mean, literally, that's why they kill.
[00:56:50.886 --> 00:56:52.826]  That's why they murder a group of psychopaths.
[00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:55.567]  Many of you look at it as a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
[00:56:55.887 --> 00:56:58.507]  A group of psychopaths have created a religion around their beliefs.
[00:56:58.567 --> 00:56:59.408]  We know better than that.
[00:56:59.708 --> 00:57:01.888]  And they're carrying out all sorts of insanity.
[00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:05.389]  And they run everything because they're ruthless and cunning and organized.
[00:57:05.409 --> 00:57:06.429]  The general public's just...
[00:57:07.049 --> 00:57:10.330]  Unaware of what's going on, and now they're going to bring in their great death.
[00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:12.211]  I have an entire section here.
[00:57:12.271 --> 00:57:15.552]  I think it's the most important section in my book.
[00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:18.433]  It's called, Where the Rich and Famous Dwell.
[00:57:19.093 --> 00:57:21.114]  Hey, they're not just building these buildings in public.
[00:57:21.654 --> 00:57:22.934]  What are their estates like?
[00:57:23.314 --> 00:57:25.295]  Now, they've opened up many of their great estates.
[00:57:25.315 --> 00:57:29.356]  You know, the DuPonts, the Astors, the Vanderbilts, the Rothschilds and others.
[00:57:29.576 --> 00:57:31.637]  They've opened up many of their estates to the public.
[00:57:32.077 --> 00:57:35.379]  And so they've taken out a lot of their satanic statues and things like that.
[00:57:35.699 --> 00:57:40.661]  But even what they've left, visit the Vanderbilt Mansion, the Biltmore Estate.
[00:57:40.861 --> 00:57:41.182]  I did.
[00:57:41.602 --> 00:57:44.083]  You'll see all the gargoyles and devils and so forth.
[00:57:44.723 --> 00:57:50.006]  But the interesting thing, and I know you've done so much to expose the Bohemian Grove, the great DuPont Estate,
[00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:58.157]  The outside the landscaping and the pool area and the architecture is built in the shape of a great owl.
[00:57:59.098 --> 00:58:03.663]  And the head of the owl is the Order of Skull and Bones symbol.
[00:58:03.943 --> 00:58:09.509]  You'll see the deaf head and what appears to be the skull, the bones crossed.
[00:58:10.089 --> 00:58:19.194]  Skull and Bones, owl, on the grounds of the DuPont Estate, and it's open to the public, but you don't notice it until you go aerially and you look down.
[00:58:19.475 --> 00:58:26.759]  You're walking maybe right there where the skull and bones is, or the head of the owl, but it has to be an aerial shot before you know what's going on.
[00:58:27.179 --> 00:58:31.562]  I mean, we know wars and things, the ritualized murder, the shock and awe, things you've talked about like that.
[00:58:32.803 --> 00:58:36.686]  They call the operation the name of a goddess and it's a double meaning, people don't even know what it means.
[00:58:38.247 --> 00:58:44.211]  How many of them though are still doing the old-fashioned Luciferian ritual of having breeders getting babies and killing them?
[00:58:45.393 --> 00:58:46.494]  Well, that's going on.
[00:58:47.075 --> 00:58:52.540]  Remember, the Masons laid the cornerstone to most of America's public buildings.
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.123]  Post offices, all the buildings in Washington D.C.
[00:58:56.143 --> 00:58:58.405]  and so forth, courthouses around the country.
[00:58:58.445 --> 00:59:00.047]  And they say abortion's a sacrifice.
[00:59:00.988 --> 00:59:03.810]  Oh yes, there is a book in fact, Abortion as a Sacrament.
[00:59:04.531 --> 00:59:05.471]  Published by a witch.
[00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:08.812]  A very popular book among these occultists.
[00:59:09.132 --> 00:59:13.294]  And they say that abortion is, in fact, a sacrifice to the god of nature.
[00:59:13.354 --> 00:59:18.455]  I'm tired of all the lower level practitioners saying that's not in our teachings or our belief or our system.
[00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:20.176]  But they just haven't graduated.
[00:59:20.216 --> 00:59:22.036]  They're porch masons or porch witches.
[00:59:22.436 --> 00:59:24.437]  They don't understand at the top it's the same thing.
[00:59:24.777 --> 00:59:26.898]  And I'm not going to traffic with people that kill babies.
[00:59:27.258 --> 00:59:28.058]  Remember again.
[00:59:28.638 --> 00:59:33.341]  The architecture of the Illuminati signals future events.
[00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:34.401]  Let's get to this real quick.
[00:59:34.761 --> 00:59:37.343]  In 1935... Stand there, we're coming right back.
[00:59:37.383 --> 00:59:42.586]  And we've got to get to some calls, but I want to have that new thought there with TechSmars.
[00:59:42.606 --> 00:59:45.047]  We've got a twisting arm to come back in and get into other areas.
[00:59:45.547 --> 00:59:47.728]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:59:48.308 --> 00:59:51.209]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:56.130]  Michael in Texas, Jeffy in London, John in Oklahoma, Morgan in Georgia.
[00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:57.290]  We're going to get to all your calls.
[00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:57.590]  1-800-259-9931.
[00:59:57.671 --> 00:59:59.631]  Tex Mars is with us again in studio.
[01:00:03.487 --> 01:00:15.955]  And I gotta tell you, get his book, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWars.com, and you can also get it discounted with my film discounted in-game that ties in with it, their master plan to carry out global extermination.
[01:00:16.215 --> 01:00:18.417]  It's all stated, it's the most important info out there.
[01:00:18.877 --> 01:00:19.777]  You need this book.
[01:00:20.057 --> 01:00:20.538]  It's huge.
[01:00:20.638 --> 01:00:21.698]  Great coffee table book.
[01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:23.418]  Great to wake up friends and family.
[01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:24.118]  Very affordable.
[01:00:24.519 --> 01:00:25.839]  Infowars.com.
[01:00:25.879 --> 01:00:28.240]  Also get my new film, Truth Rising, while you're at it.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.701]  My new cinema verite style film on DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:35.982]  Texting closing, you were talking about how they signal future events.
[01:00:36.002 --> 01:00:36.682]  Then we're going to go to calls.
[01:00:37.182 --> 01:00:40.924]  Through architecture, and through symbology, and even through the currency.
[01:00:41.524 --> 01:00:55.391]  In 1935, Franklin Roosevelt, then a 32 degree mason, and his Secretary of Agriculture, who was a 33 degree mason, Henry Wallace, they had a plan and they changed the currency of the United States for the first time in 1935.
[01:00:55.511 --> 01:01:03.235]  It was finally admitted to the public that there was a reverse, a secret hidden side of the Great Seal.
[01:01:03.955 --> 01:01:04.515]  That's right.
[01:01:04.595 --> 01:01:05.576]  You can be shown the pyramid now.
[01:01:05.616 --> 01:01:06.516]  It's only a one dollar bill.
[01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:14.020]  The Great Pyramid of Egypt, the All-Seeing Eye of the Sun God, or Lucifer, and the words Novus Ordo Seclorum.
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:14.020]  1935.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.021]  And guess what?
[01:01:16.921 --> 01:01:22.203]  Exactly, exactly six years later, great human sacrifice and blood.
[01:01:22.564 --> 01:01:23.244]  Pearl Harbor.
[01:01:23.724 --> 01:01:29.167]  The inauguration into the World War II era of the United States.
[01:01:29.547 --> 01:01:30.368]  The number six.
[01:01:30.768 --> 01:01:37.331]  Six years after we had the great sign of Osiris and Horus, the great sun god and his son, and the pyramid.
[01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:43.394]  We had unleashed this great American death period with Pearl Harbor.
[01:01:43.635 --> 01:01:45.716]  So everything is signal in advance.
[01:01:45.776 --> 01:01:51.919]  The Georgia Guidestones saying we intend to catapult the world into this new world order and there will be great death.
[01:01:52.119 --> 01:01:55.521]  So this was the secret seal that could only be shown to the slaves in 35.
[01:01:55.561 --> 01:01:57.021]  That's right.
[01:01:57.121 --> 01:02:03.264]  And they'd already had the seal made, turn of the century, 30 years plus before, if I remember the story correctly.
[01:02:03.485 --> 01:02:08.827]  But then they finally even had a little display and said, look, ah, you can see this now.
[01:02:08.927 --> 01:02:09.988]  Let's go ahead and show folks.
[01:02:10.128 --> 01:02:14.430]  Yes, origins actually go all the way back to Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, but it was kept hidden.
[01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:22.812]  I've just seen a documentary where they showed when they had the one minute that they had at the Capitol, I believe, and there was another side they showed everybody.
[01:02:22.832 --> 01:02:24.533]  Yeah, they call this the obverse side.
[01:02:24.913 --> 01:02:26.113]  I think it's quite interesting.
[01:02:26.373 --> 01:02:34.356]  By the way, even the Great Eagle itself is a sign of empire, and over the eagle you will see a six-pointed star, the hexagram.
[01:02:34.636 --> 01:02:38.257]  It's not just a star, it is the six-pointed star
[01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:42.625]  The hexagram that is used to put a curse on things.
[01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:43.907]  So I want to ask you a question.
[01:02:44.388 --> 01:02:45.791]  Did they place a curse?
[01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:53.232]  on the United States with this great hexagram placed over the eagle on our dollar bill.
[01:02:53.652 --> 01:02:57.115]  But again, all of this is mirrored in architecture.
[01:02:57.735 --> 01:02:59.997]  These people have these unheavenly visions.
[01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:14.148]  I want to mention, too, that the United Nations building was built on Egyptian satanic architectural principles, worshiping the god Shu, and I have a picture of that in Mysterious Monuments, the United Nations Secretariat building,
[01:03:14.728 --> 01:03:22.511]  And, predictably, shortly after the United Nations was formed, the Korean War ensued, and great death and bloodshed.
[01:03:22.791 --> 01:03:26.953]  So, bloodshed and death follows architecture.
[01:03:27.393 --> 01:03:41.418]  And I think we can see the plans of the Illuminati, the grand design that Manly P. Hall, 33rd degree Mason, called it, the grand design is revealed in architecture, unknown to the average person.
[01:03:42.668 --> 01:03:47.153]  But known only to the higher level, uh, hierophants and initiates.
[01:03:47.814 --> 01:03:52.098]  Okay, amazing information, and a lot of it is covered in Mysterious Monuments.
[01:03:52.118 --> 01:04:00.307]  You can also, at InfoWars.com, when you get Mysterious Monuments, get the first part, which, uh, is, of course, Codex Magicka, just as thick, just as amazing.
[01:04:00.327 --> 01:04:04.612]  And briefly, tell folks what's covered in Codex Magicka for those that don't have it, Tex.
[01:04:04.952 --> 01:04:09.913]  Well, Codex Magicka is another huge book with a thousand photographs and illustrations.
[01:04:10.454 --> 01:04:28.459]  Codex Magicka is the same size as Mysterious Monuments, but it covers the Illuminati and the Elite and all of the secret societies, including Freemasonry, their secret hand signs, their secret rituals, done in plain sight on television and magazines and newspapers, how they actually contort their bodies.
[01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:33.345]  And handshakes, symbols, signs, the meaning of these.
[01:04:34.066 --> 01:04:36.769]  And it's just amazing what you find.
[01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:40.775]  And Tex, when did you really wake up to the New World Order?
[01:04:40.795 --> 01:04:41.135]  20 years ago?
[01:04:42.048 --> 01:04:46.490]  Well, I believe, yeah, I can almost, I remember, it just knocked me down when I discovered it.
[01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:54.194]  You know, I really, to point it back, I had done much exposing the New Age movement and its occultic ways.
[01:04:54.214 --> 01:04:56.195]  Infiltrating Christianity and it led you back.
[01:04:56.215 --> 01:05:04.339]  Yeah, well, I had a young man, a tremendously brilliant guy, he worked for a high tech, I'll just tell you, he worked for IBM, an engineer.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.781]  He graduated from Yale University, he came to visit me,
[01:05:07.661 --> 01:05:08.562]  And he was a Christian man.
[01:05:08.582 --> 01:05:16.308]  He says, Tex, I know you've done all the study of the occult and mystery Babylon and the ancient religions, but are you aware of the secret societies?
[01:05:16.348 --> 01:05:22.013]  And he said, I studied the Order of Skull and Bones when I was a student at Yale University.
[01:05:22.633 --> 01:05:24.034]  And I said, well tell me what you know.
[01:05:24.334 --> 01:05:24.795]  And he did.
[01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:29.959]  And by the way, he had written a dissertation while he was at Yale University
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.001]  Roger Javins was his name.
[01:05:32.381 --> 01:05:34.462]  And he said, here, I want you to see this.
[01:05:34.763 --> 01:05:38.585]  That propelled me into this incredible study of secret societies.
[01:05:38.605 --> 01:05:40.466]  That took you behind the curtain, behind the curtain.
[01:05:40.486 --> 01:05:44.769]  Well, it did, and I'd say that was about 22 years ago now, today.
[01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:51.233]  And that's why mysterious monuments and Codex Magicka are based on over 20 years of research and investigation.
[01:05:51.253 --> 01:05:53.715]  That's where I was going, is that this is really
[01:05:54.896 --> 01:06:06.453]  I don't want to say you're penultimate because you're going to do a lot more, but this is really the sum or the essence of your work and research, and it's so important that people have these.
[01:06:06.473 --> 01:06:08.576]  We're going to your calls, but I do want to draw a picture for people.
[01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:09.116]  Very simple.
[01:06:10.354 --> 01:06:15.038]  The globalists, their symbol is also the pyramid, the Illuminati, because it's a symbol of compartmentalization.
[01:06:15.058 --> 01:06:18.300]  We're the big mass down here at the bottom, and then they're the illuminated ones on top.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:25.846]  But to make it more simple and squares, you see this, you're in a box, and we'll show people a close shot of this.
[01:06:26.766 --> 01:06:33.551]  You think you see everything, but really you're a Republican or you're a Democrat, you've got this limited view.
[01:06:34.542 --> 01:06:51.263]  And then meanwhile you have no idea that you are part of a larger structure, that there are other people who have their own views and their own ideas and their own systems of thought and there's even different cults and different groups that think they have all the answers and different organizations and governments and strata.
[01:06:52.845 --> 01:06:54.747]  The Illuminati, they have unlimited funding.
[01:06:55.127 --> 01:07:02.374]  They are just masters at having their people with different levels of knowledge controlling all of these strata with corporate management systems.
[01:07:02.474 --> 01:07:03.435]  And that's why they're in control.
[01:07:03.695 --> 01:07:04.656]  They know they're the builders.
[01:07:04.696 --> 01:07:05.557]  They're the architects.
[01:07:05.957 --> 01:07:07.158]  They know how to lay all this out.
[01:07:07.198 --> 01:07:08.439]  They pay attention to detail.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:17.248]  And that's why they say you're profane and deserve to die because you can't even figure out that you are limited and blinded down to the point of not even able to see outside this box.
[01:07:17.788 --> 01:07:24.470]  So I don't claim that you have to believe everything I'm saying or what Tex is saying, though I trust to know what Tex is saying is accurate because I've studied what he's reported.
[01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:29.012]  I just want you to realize you are in a box, and all of us are to a certain extent.
[01:07:29.252 --> 01:07:31.112]  You know, we're finite, we're not infinite like God.
[01:07:31.592 --> 01:07:39.555]  The Illuminati tries to play God, but they use systems and mechanisms and mathematics to try to mimic it, and it's a joke compared to what God does.
[01:07:40.195 --> 01:07:42.798]  I mean, even a joke is saying too much.
[01:07:43.198 --> 01:07:47.543]  But compared to what we as individuals do, it is, you know, John marveled at the Beast.
[01:07:48.123 --> 01:07:49.845]  And that's the whole system.
[01:07:50.625 --> 01:07:52.487]  And so that's what we're facing here.
[01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:57.292]  I want to go to calls, but briefly, you know, how the compartmentalization operates.
[01:07:57.452 --> 01:08:02.693]  Well, Alex, we have some tremendous people out there that are exposing different facets of this, and I commend them.
[01:08:02.933 --> 01:08:10.495]  For example, there are people out there that are studying the Jesuit Order, the Order of the Jesuits, which is a Catholic Order, or the Knights of Malta, or Opus Dei.
[01:08:11.215 --> 01:08:17.037]  Others really focus their attention on the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, or Freemasonry.
[01:08:17.517 --> 01:08:25.479]  Now, you know, I'm glad for all these things, but they get so focused on the one group, they forget, as you just did,
[01:08:26.059 --> 01:08:28.340]  That the pyramid has many stones.
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.801]  It has many facets.
[01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:31.681]  And listen, they will end one.
[01:08:32.022 --> 01:08:35.583]  If the Bohemian Grove is exposed too much, they'll end it and start another one.
[01:08:36.383 --> 01:08:42.546]  So they're not beyond this incredible proliferation of secret societies and groups.
[01:08:42.946 --> 01:08:44.367]  So we need to understand
[01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:51.153]  That if a person says, oh no, it's only the Jesuits, it's only the Vatican, it's only this, it's only the Zionists.
[01:08:51.654 --> 01:08:52.114]  No, no, no.
[01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:59.162]  These people have created a system where everything concretes together, fits together.
[01:08:59.622 --> 01:09:02.105]  And as you just said, they are the capstone.
[01:09:02.685 --> 01:09:08.191]  And they're going to crown this monumental system, even this architectural colossus.
[01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:13.137]  And everything is being built now, and the ultimate is coming up.
[01:09:13.157 --> 01:09:17.322]  And I believe that the year 2009, for example, will be a very important year.
[01:09:17.922 --> 01:09:19.443]  Because 2 times 9 equals 18.
[01:09:19.903 --> 01:09:22.584]  And 18 is 6 plus 6 plus 6.
[01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:23.784]  Is that ridiculous?
[01:09:23.924 --> 01:09:25.265]  Of course it's ridiculous!
[01:09:25.865 --> 01:09:26.845]  It's absurd!
[01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:28.766]  But they believe it.
[01:09:29.106 --> 01:09:31.527]  The Illuminists actually believe it.
[01:09:31.907 --> 01:09:35.508]  And they have their lower-level subordinates, let's just call them.
[01:09:35.788 --> 01:09:43.811]  The George Bushes, the Cheneys, the Olmerts, the Browns, and so forth, to do their bidding.
[01:09:43.911 --> 01:09:46.352]  All of these people are servants themselves.
[01:09:47.466 --> 01:09:48.047]  Absolutely.
[01:09:48.087 --> 01:09:51.389]  Let's take a call, and as we go into break, we'll take calls behind the scenes as well.
[01:09:52.570 --> 01:09:55.652]  Let's talk to Chaffee in London first.
[01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.354]  You're on the air with Tex Mars Worldwide.
[01:09:57.374 --> 01:09:58.334]  Hello?
[01:09:58.875 --> 01:09:59.455]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:00.336]  Yeah, hi.
[01:10:00.356 --> 01:10:02.017]  Sorry, this is the first time.
[01:10:02.378 --> 01:10:05.100]  Basically, there was a couple of points I needed to mention.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.161]  First one was in respect.
[01:10:07.221 --> 01:10:08.522]  I'm actually a Muslim from London.
[01:10:09.523 --> 01:10:10.224]  Wait, wait.
[01:10:10.244 --> 01:10:12.826]  Tex is getting his headset on, and they're having a malfunction.
[01:10:13.826 --> 01:10:14.847]  Let me help you with them, Tex.
[01:10:14.867 --> 01:10:15.608]  Keep talking, Chaffee.
[01:10:16.226 --> 01:10:16.686]  Yeah, hello.
[01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:21.550]  Yeah, basically I just wanted to thank your guest and yourself for all the work that you've done.
[01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:24.592]  But there was just a couple of points I wanted to mention.
[01:10:24.712 --> 01:10:31.958]  One was in respect to the star and the crescent, which many people today actually state it's a true Islamic symbol.
[01:10:32.078 --> 01:10:34.980]  Its origins are actually from Constantinople.
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:39.623]  When the Muslims took Constantinople in 1453... That's right, they adopted the symbol of the city.
[01:10:39.663 --> 01:10:44.387]  What happened was the symbol of Constantinople was the star and the crescent.
[01:10:45.187 --> 01:10:51.211]  Well, hold on a minute, now that's true, but they liked the sign because they already liked the moon.
[01:10:51.571 --> 01:10:54.172]  Muhammad came from a tribe that were moon worshippers.
[01:10:54.552 --> 01:10:59.075]  No, this is actually about six or seven thousand years preceding that.
[01:10:59.315 --> 01:11:05.659]  We can debate these issues, but there was a couple of other things I wanted to mention as well.
[01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:07.660]  Constantinople isn't eight thousand years old, sir.
[01:11:10.117 --> 01:11:12.040]  No, it's about 7,000 years old, actually.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:20.392]  I mean, if you actually go into the history of it, the symbol itself... We're going to keep talking behind the scenes with you for all the Prison Planet TV viewers.
[01:11:20.432 --> 01:11:21.834]  Final segment with Tex coming up, fine.
[01:11:23.996 --> 01:11:35.687]  I mean, we're just here talking about how it is now a Muslim symbol today, it's on top of the mosque, it's on the flags, and the point is that they're making the memorial of that out in Shanksville.
[01:11:35.707 --> 01:11:36.808]  So that's not debatable.
[01:11:37.088 --> 01:11:38.790]  We'll find out exactly what you're getting at here.
[01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:40.912]  Man, this hour and a half has gone by so fast.
[01:11:40.932 --> 01:11:41.893]  Your call is straight ahead.
[01:11:42.714 --> 01:11:43.995]  Michelle, John, Morgan, others.
[01:11:44.015 --> 01:11:45.096]  Stay there, Cheffy.
[01:11:45.376 --> 01:11:46.837]  Okay, Cheffy, go ahead and finish up.
[01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.991]  They did infiltrate the Sunni Islam.
[01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:58.258]  What they basically did was they removed certain books, which today Muslims are completely ignorant about.
[01:11:58.618 --> 01:12:05.726]  However, slowly, this information is now actually, you know, in the year 2009, it's actually now coming to light.
[01:12:06.266 --> 01:12:11.672]  And, you know, I think it's just a matter of time before people actually wake up and smell the bacon.
[01:12:12.012 --> 01:12:12.072]  Jax?
[01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.382]  Hey, I like what this London caller is saying.
[01:12:31.843 --> 01:12:42.128]  Again, I think it's really important that instead of us sticking to our points of confusion, we should come to common terms.
[01:12:42.568 --> 01:12:48.831]  Well, listen, sir, that wasn't a point of confusion.
[01:12:49.391 --> 01:12:53.253]  We were showing that they're manipulating and involved in all the religion.
[01:12:53.513 --> 01:13:18.751]  It's very clever, I mean I've actually been studying how the British did it and what they did was over a period of 150 years they infiltrated all the different sects as such and then they basically created, what they did was these individuals basically said they were Muslims and then they lived as Muslims for a period of 40, 50 and 60 years and one such dope that they picked up was this guy called Abdul Rahab
[01:13:19.332 --> 01:13:27.094]  And, you know, basically they loaded him, you know, and, you know, it was primarily to do, you know, I mean... Thank you, Jeffy.
[01:13:27.895 --> 01:13:28.615]  Jeffy, thank you.
[01:13:28.635 --> 01:13:29.355]  Sometime call back in.
[01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:29.915]  We'll talk more about it.
[01:13:29.935 --> 01:13:31.616]  I just want to get everybody in while we can.
[01:13:31.936 --> 01:13:33.976]  Michelle in Texas, you're on the air with TexMars.
[01:13:34.016 --> 01:13:34.396]  Go ahead.
[01:13:38.217 --> 01:13:38.938]  Come on, Michelle.
[01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:39.278]  You there?
[01:13:39.658 --> 01:13:40.578]  Yes, I'm here, Alex.
[01:13:40.598 --> 01:13:40.798]  Go ahead.
[01:13:40.818 --> 01:13:41.779]  You're on the air with TexMars.
[01:13:41.979 --> 01:13:42.619]  Wonderful.
[01:13:42.699 --> 01:13:46.700]  Tex, I want to say that I think that your book, I'm looking at it right now,
[01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:50.092]  It's absolutely wonderful, and I'm kind of intrigued, too.
[01:13:50.772 --> 01:14:00.057]  By page 29, you talk about Isaac Segret, who built the pyramid in Memphis.
[01:14:00.277 --> 01:14:00.417]  Yes.
[01:14:00.517 --> 01:14:08.621]  So I'm reading up on that, and I'm going to do some additional research, but I basically want to say, God bless you, Alex, as well, for all that you do.
[01:14:08.761 --> 01:14:09.361]  I am a U.S.
[01:14:09.401 --> 01:14:16.845]  veteran, and I talked to you a little bit more than a year ago, but there's just been so much going on, and just my only plea to people
[01:14:17.446 --> 01:14:23.670]  out there who aren't aware of this being real, that this is real, and with no shadow of a doubt.
[01:14:24.191 --> 01:14:38.281]  Me being a former veteran, I was stationed in Fort Carson, Colorado, right in the heart of Colorado Springs, Colorado, where Obama just did his speech talking about the Nazis, Nazi, and the youth.
[01:14:38.861 --> 01:14:41.623]  I just want to point out that this stuff is very much real.
[01:14:42.348 --> 01:14:56.698]  And also the fact that I'm African American, I catch a lot of heat for supporting Ron Paul and not Obama and I just think that it's crazy for people to not really do their own research to find out what's really going on.
[01:14:56.718 --> 01:15:02.362]  I've since relocated to Dallas and just trying to get the word out to people in this area too.
[01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:05.878]  Time and gas and everything.
[01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:09.821]  I would love to make a trip out there to Austin to see everything that she walks about there.
[01:15:09.901 --> 01:15:10.182]  Absolutely.
[01:15:10.202 --> 01:15:14.606]  But Michelle, tell us about, we know they're gearing up for martial law out in Colorado.
[01:15:14.866 --> 01:15:15.486]  Absolutely.
[01:15:15.606 --> 01:15:21.872]  Even in my neighborhood where I'm at now, I mean, they constantly, they do police checks.
[01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:23.453]  And it's very serious.
[01:15:23.594 --> 01:15:28.018]  And I think, I praise God for your guest yesterday, Freeman, who mentioned the fact
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.762]  Um, when he was confronted with police that he made the comment, widow son.
[01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:42.767]  So I know that when I get confronted again, because I was confronted two weeks ago in a local shopping mall by police, um, they still felt that there was a lot of chaos going on.
[01:15:42.787 --> 01:15:44.147]  Stay there, we're coming back on the main show.
[01:15:44.167 --> 01:15:45.128]  Tell us about the martial law.
[01:15:45.148 --> 01:15:45.388]  Here we go.
[01:15:50.558 --> 01:15:53.480]  Well, time has just blasted past, and I want to go to John and Morgan.
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:16:02.484]  We were talking to Michelle from PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, and she was talking about how she was out at Colorado Springs, Colorado, where they're openly setting up the martial law takeover of America.
[01:16:03.024 --> 01:16:07.647]  So she gets out of the military and goes to Dallas, and now they're running checkpoints in her neighborhood.
[01:16:07.667 --> 01:16:10.388]  Now they're going to use the National Guard for gun confiscation.
[01:16:10.408 --> 01:16:11.629]  They just calmly announce it.
[01:16:12.329 --> 01:16:13.770]  I mean, it's happening, folks.
[01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:14.771]  They're putting it in place.
[01:16:15.091 --> 01:16:17.212]  Finish up with what's happening in Dallas, Michelle.
[01:16:17.492 --> 01:16:18.213]  Well, absolutely.
[01:16:18.253 --> 01:16:20.815]  I can only talk about from my own personal experience.
[01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:27.041]  And again, I just want to point out again to anybody who's new to listening to your show that I am a U.S.
[01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:27.541]  Veteran.
[01:16:27.742 --> 01:16:31.225]  I served proudly in my country, the U.S.
[01:16:31.365 --> 01:16:33.067]  Army, the whole Iraq War thing.
[01:16:33.427 --> 01:16:36.430]  But I have a spirit of discernment and I went with my heart.
[01:16:36.929 --> 01:16:37.990]  Yeah, I'm good.
[01:16:53.832 --> 01:16:55.173]  Um, which was about two weeks ago.
[01:16:55.193 --> 01:17:00.378]  I got confronted by the local mall, um, police as well as the, um, city police.
[01:17:00.418 --> 01:17:09.506]  And they were in there and I made the comment to him saying that you, you essentially what you sharing a show, how this is a Nazi kind of operation.
[01:17:09.566 --> 01:17:12.969]  And he got completely upset with me and walked away.
[01:17:13.069 --> 01:17:17.193]  But it was, it blew my mind because I thought to myself, this is real.
[01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:22.712]  And I'm a soldier, or a former soldier, a veteran, and this is how they treat me.
[01:17:22.932 --> 01:17:24.273]  Of course, they didn't know that.
[01:17:24.393 --> 01:17:27.375]  They didn't know that, but it doesn't matter.
[01:17:27.595 --> 01:17:28.736]  Yeah, they're turning the heat up.
[01:17:29.036 --> 01:17:30.077]  They're turning the heat up slowly.
[01:17:30.137 --> 01:17:33.078]  Michelle, call me back another day when there's not a guest, and tell me more about this.
[01:17:33.138 --> 01:17:33.899]  It's everywhere.
[01:17:33.959 --> 01:17:34.299]  Boston.
[01:17:34.519 --> 01:17:39.222]  When I was in D.C., there'd be crowds of tourists just in the middle of a park, and cops would come over and yell at them.
[01:17:39.562 --> 01:17:44.605]  And it was there to let you know that you're a slave, and now it's happening everywhere, Tex.
[01:17:45.731 --> 01:17:59.306]  Well, you know, a lady like Michelle, who has served this country and deserves respect, can you believe that President Bush and John McCain opposed, violently opposed, the GI Bill, the Education Act?
[01:18:02.289 --> 01:18:07.133]  They don't want to pay for their college because they want to keep them entrapped in the military.
[01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:09.514]  They're afraid too many may get out and go to college.
[01:18:09.754 --> 01:18:14.178]  This was just horrible, the treatment through the Veterans Administration and everything.
[01:18:14.498 --> 01:18:25.246]  Listen, I'm getting on a tangent here, but after a 20-year career in the Air Force, people deserve more respect from our government.
[01:18:25.626 --> 01:18:26.647]  And I'll tell you something else.
[01:18:27.487 --> 01:18:32.917]  Our men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve to know the truth about 9-11.
[01:18:33.077 --> 01:18:38.708]  And it is unpatriotic to oppose the truth-telling.
[01:18:40.094 --> 01:18:40.654]  Absolutely.
[01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:42.775]  They are the unpatriots.
[01:18:43.235 --> 01:18:57.078]  We're the patriots because we're saying we want to know for the sake of our men and women who have lost limbs and lives and sacrificed in the Iraq War and Afghanistan, we want them to know what the truth is about 9-11.
[01:18:57.558 --> 01:18:59.138]  I'm sorry, I just got a little upset about that.
[01:18:59.198 --> 01:18:59.978]  No, no, I agree.
[01:19:00.018 --> 01:19:01.318]  They treat them like absolute crap.
[01:19:01.338 --> 01:19:03.279]  They're even denying them health care now, as you know.
[01:19:04.559 --> 01:19:10.202]  Have you heard 35 year employees, even managers at GM are being told no healthcare?
[01:19:11.323 --> 01:19:13.584]  They have contracts saying they're supposed to get it and they say no.
[01:19:13.785 --> 01:19:18.007]  Well across America, healthcare is being cut out by corporations.
[01:19:18.547 --> 01:19:23.450]  And now it's going to be government, which is going to sound good, but then that's going to be eugenics.
[01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:23.830]  That's right.
[01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:30.054]  They're pushing people, and now people are going to say, hey Obama, President Obama or President McCain, we've got to have health care now.
[01:19:30.415 --> 01:19:32.536]  And of course, you're absolutely right.
[01:19:32.556 --> 01:19:38.140]  And now they'll be able to, the government is going to do what they want with you and tell the doctors what to do so they can carry out eugenics.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.582]  I apologize to John and Morgan and others, we just don't have time to get to you.
[01:19:42.383 --> 01:19:43.143]  We are out of time.
[01:19:43.163 --> 01:19:46.325]  I have an Academy Award winner coming up to talk about two films she's doing.
[01:19:47.026 --> 01:19:49.868]  And it's just been absolutely amazing having Tex in here.
[01:19:50.208 --> 01:19:52.509]  Tex, give people the toll-free number.
[01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.732]  So they can call and get a free copy, sign up for your newsletter.
[01:19:56.752 --> 01:19:58.133]  They get it free all year, every month.
[01:19:59.093 --> 01:20:00.914]  Tell them how they can call and get a free copy of that.
[01:20:01.174 --> 01:20:04.016]  Oh yeah, we'll give them the special edition on Mysterious Monuments.
[01:20:04.797 --> 01:20:06.037]  It has a lot of pictures in it and such.
[01:20:06.217 --> 01:20:06.978]  No cost at all.
[01:20:07.398 --> 01:20:08.138]  Absolutely free.
[01:20:08.158 --> 01:20:14.042]  Just call us toll free 1-800-234-9673.
[01:20:14.382 --> 01:20:15.162]  Give us your address.
[01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:17.084]  Nobody will ask for a penny from you.
[01:20:17.584 --> 01:20:19.245]  Of course the book is available through
[01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:24.614]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PowerOfProphecy.com.
[01:20:24.895 --> 01:20:27.018]  But the free newsletter, hey, they don't have to buy anything.
[01:20:27.058 --> 01:20:27.519]  Just call 1-800-234-9673.
[01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:35.231]  Absolutely, and I really do hope that listeners will get Tex Barr's book.
[01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:40.792]  You can also call toll-free and get it at 888-253-3139.
[01:20:41.232 --> 01:20:42.212]  Also, get Endgame.
[01:20:42.232 --> 01:20:43.492]  People need to see that film.
[01:20:43.512 --> 01:20:44.853]  That film's really waking people up.
[01:20:44.893 --> 01:20:50.974]  If you haven't gotten a DVD of Endgame, this information is very damaging to the New World Order, and who knows how long you'll be able to get it.
[01:20:51.334 --> 01:20:55.295]  I mean, don't take these shows and the internet and radio and books and films for granted.
[01:20:55.315 --> 01:20:57.435]  So go to Infowars.com or call toll-free.
[01:20:58.135 --> 01:21:02.577]  And get Mysterious Monuments, get Endgame, get my new film Truth Rising.
[01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:03.918]  They all need to be seen.
[01:21:04.358 --> 01:21:06.259]  And you need to realize that you're the solution.
[01:21:06.299 --> 01:21:06.899]  Look in the mirror.
[01:21:07.299 --> 01:21:10.120]  It's you that's going to fight the New World Order and wake up hearts and minds.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.941]  They're out recruiting their people right now.
[01:21:11.961 --> 01:21:14.762]  We've got to recruit ours.
[01:21:14.782 --> 01:21:15.062]  888-253-3139.
[01:21:15.122 --> 01:21:19.964]  Or you can see all my films online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:21:20.185 --> 01:21:22.826]  We're going to come back with Ivo Orner.
[01:21:22.846 --> 01:21:23.886]  I want to thank Tex Mars.
[01:21:23.926 --> 01:21:24.947]  Thanks, it was incredible, Tex.
[01:21:24.967 --> 01:21:25.527]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:21:26.087 --> 01:21:26.687]  God bless you my friend.
[01:21:26.727 --> 01:21:28.048]  Just absolutely amazing.
[01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:33.311]  I'm going to twist Tex's arm and get him back here in the next month or two to really take a lot of calls.
[01:21:33.351 --> 01:21:34.031]  God bless you all.
[01:21:34.051 --> 01:21:34.591]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:35.852]  We're on the march.
[01:21:36.332 --> 01:21:37.933]  The empire's on the run.
[01:21:38.873 --> 01:21:39.614]  Alex Jones.
[01:21:58.898 --> 01:22:14.117]  Well, for the next 30 minutes, Eva Orner is our guest, Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker of Taxi to the Dark Side, the torture and mass murder of children, knowing they were totally innocent just to create the image that they were fighting Al-Cieda.
[01:22:16.175 --> 01:22:21.061]  And I want to get a recap from her about the aftermath of the film coming out, winning the Academy Award.
[01:22:22.423 --> 01:22:23.644]  Now more has come out.
[01:22:23.704 --> 01:22:31.033]  You've got the International Association of Doctors, Generals of the Military, and our own government saying it's high treason, that it's all war crimes.
[01:22:31.053 --> 01:22:32.675]  So really vindicated, validated.
[01:22:33.496 --> 01:22:37.440]  Vindicated in the right word, because they were always right, and everybody pretty much commended him.
[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.722]  But validated, Ian Spage.
[01:22:41.243 --> 01:22:46.207]  But also she's here because coming out is Gonzo, the life and work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:22:47.108 --> 01:22:49.029]  And it's also narrated by
[01:22:50.444 --> 01:22:51.125]  Johnny Depp.
[01:22:51.745 --> 01:22:55.209]  Eva Orner just is involved in so much fine work.
[01:22:55.249 --> 01:23:02.616]  I met her when she was here working on a documentary kind of covering the 9-11 truth movement with us, but she's not here to talk about that today.
[01:23:03.156 --> 01:23:08.341]  And so we have her with us, and later we're going to play a clip of Hunter S. Thompson talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:23:08.682 --> 01:23:10.924]  I'd also interviewed some of his friends who set up before he died.
[01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:12.766]  He was working on stories about Bush.
[01:23:13.346 --> 01:23:19.430]  and pedophile rings and gay porn stars and the rest of it, which came out in the news later that we're in the White House, you know, the gay porn stars.
[01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:23.492]  But Eva Orner, it's very nice to have you on with us.
[01:23:24.293 --> 01:23:26.514]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.115]  It's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:23:28.435 --> 01:23:34.059]  They're announcing National Guard do house-to-house gun confiscation just nonchalantly in America.
[01:23:34.699 --> 01:23:40.883]  Obama's calling for a million-man Stasi force and it's just, everything is insane.
[01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:43.630]  It certainly is.
[01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:45.151]  It certainly is.
[01:23:45.751 --> 01:23:47.253]  I'm just glad I get to make movies.
[01:23:48.013 --> 01:23:51.736]  Yeah, and go to dangerous places like Afghanistan and China and the rest of it.
[01:23:52.176 --> 01:23:53.357]  Tell us about Gonzo.
[01:23:53.397 --> 01:23:54.298]  Let's get into that first.
[01:23:55.198 --> 01:24:04.064]  We actually made Gonzo at the same time as we were making Taxi to the Dark Side, which was a really interesting thing to be doing at the same time.
[01:24:04.265 --> 01:24:06.106]  I think in a lot of ways it really helped us with
[01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:14.553]  Making Taxi because it was, well it's not a light film by any means, it's definitely a lot lighter than The Subject of Torture, which we covered in Taxi.
[01:24:14.613 --> 01:24:17.614]  So we made them concurrently.
[01:24:19.854 --> 01:24:31.879]  It's a film about the great, late Hunter S. Thompson, who's one of the finest journalists and writers that have come out of America in, I would say, comfortably the last 50 to 100 years.
[01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:36.489]  And we were approached to make it after he killed himself.
[01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:37.670]  So we started making it.
[01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:46.311]  The first thing we shot was actually his ashes scattering that Johnny Depp organized at his house in Woody Creek, at Hunter's house in Woody Creek.
[01:24:46.771 --> 01:24:51.232]  And then, you know, we had unprecedented access to all of Hunter's estate.
[01:24:51.272 --> 01:24:52.872]  You know, he was an incredible hoarder.
[01:24:52.912 --> 01:24:55.753]  So we had access to all of this incredible archival material.
[01:24:56.393 --> 01:25:00.073]  And we had an incredible team of researchers who went through it all and put it together.
[01:25:00.153 --> 01:25:02.954]  And, you know, it's just a really comprehensive look at
[01:25:03.672 --> 01:25:12.647]  The pinnacle of his career, which was when he wrote, in the late 60s and early 70s, when he wrote Hell's Angels, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and Fear and Loathing on the campaign trail.
[01:25:13.251 --> 01:25:14.931]  And some seminal articles as well.
[01:25:16.392 --> 01:25:22.253]  While you were, and I want to talk about the film, and it's getting great reviews by the New York Times and others, just congratulations.
[01:25:22.613 --> 01:25:23.474]  Thank you.
[01:25:23.514 --> 01:25:25.054]  You've hit the zeitgeist, Eva Orner.
[01:25:25.074 --> 01:25:27.455]  You've made so many films before this that are great as well.
[01:25:27.475 --> 01:25:37.317]  Well, we have to also credit the person that I worked with that whole time, who's really the force behind these films, which is the great director Alex Gibney, who also directed Taxi to the Dark Side.
[01:25:38.942 --> 01:25:41.062]  And of course, he also, before that, made the Enron film.
[01:25:41.322 --> 01:25:42.003]  Exactly.
[01:25:42.023 --> 01:25:44.343]  He's a really amazing force to be reckoned with.
[01:25:44.363 --> 01:25:45.623]  He's an incredible filmmaker.
[01:25:46.723 --> 01:25:49.744]  Well, he also, I mean, not just as a filmmaker, he picks great topics.
[01:25:49.824 --> 01:25:50.784]  Great, great subjects.
[01:25:51.384 --> 01:25:52.464]  You know, great things to cover.
[01:25:53.185 --> 01:25:57.885]  Yeah, he definitely knows how to get in trouble.
[01:25:58.246 --> 01:25:59.406]  Man, I can't wait to see this.
[01:25:59.466 --> 01:26:04.227]  I know it'll be next near impossible to see it at any of the film festivals.
[01:26:04.247 --> 01:26:05.727]  How are we going to be able to see this?
[01:26:06.793 --> 01:26:07.273]  Gonzo?
[01:26:07.593 --> 01:26:15.695]  Gonzo came out on July 4 in 25 cities across the country and I was just checking with your producer and it is on in Austin at the minute.
[01:26:15.955 --> 01:26:17.595]  Well guys, we're going to have to go see this.
[01:26:17.615 --> 01:26:20.696]  I also want to see that movie about the Huns.
[01:26:21.136 --> 01:26:24.076]  We've been so busy, they want to scurry off and watch Batman.
[01:26:24.116 --> 01:26:25.036]  I don't particularly want to.
[01:26:25.556 --> 01:26:28.257]  And Jason can't go, he's got to go watch Ultimate Fighting Saturday.
[01:26:29.037 --> 01:26:30.977]  But yeah, I want to go see it.
[01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:32.758]  Well, fantastic.
[01:26:32.778 --> 01:26:33.818]  Tell us more about the film.
[01:26:36.459 --> 01:27:02.954]  So, I mean, the thing about Hunter, I think, when people think about Hunter S. Thompson, a lot of people have very preconceived ideas about, you know, he was a big partier, he hung out with a lot of celebrities, or a lot of celebrities hung out with him, you know, he took copious amounts of drugs, he was very famous for the amount of alcohol and drugs that he took, and, you know, what we did was actually make a film that's got a really, it's a lot of fun and it's a great film to watch, but it's actually really serious in
[01:27:04.455 --> 01:27:09.117]  Um, in its tone and it's a great history lesson and a great recount of history.
[01:27:09.437 --> 01:27:19.342]  And we actually start the film with a really, you know, our, what's the word, I guess our style of, you know, a dig at the current US administration.
[01:27:19.742 --> 01:27:33.589]  Before Hunter killed himself, he wasn't terribly prolific for the last few years of his life, but he was writing a blog for ESPN and he wrote this incredible blog in response to 9-11 as he was watching it happen on television.
[01:27:34.108 --> 01:27:36.769]  He really predicted what was going to happen.
[01:27:36.789 --> 01:27:44.172]  He predicted that George Bush was going to declare martial law, and he kind of predicted the Patriot Act, and all of this amazing stuff.
[01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:52.195]  So we actually start the film with that, and Johnny Depp's reading it, because Johnny Depp played Hunter in the Terry Gilliam movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
[01:27:52.695 --> 01:27:59.137]  So Johnny Depp narrates the film as Hunter, and we only use Hunter's actual written words as narration in the film.
[01:27:59.197 --> 01:28:00.858]  So it's sort of very artful and lovely.
[01:28:01.458 --> 01:28:03.819]  But the film starts with this scathing account of
[01:28:04.597 --> 01:28:20.946]  Of what was happening in America, and then it goes back and kind of traces his career from his early days as a young journalist and writer, all the way through to being a pop culture icon, until his death.
[01:28:20.966 --> 01:28:33.393]  I think one of the best parts of the film, or one of my favorite parts of the film, is when we cover the great book that he wrote, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail, in 1972, and George McGovern features very heavily in that section, and we cover the Eagleton Affair,
[01:28:34.564 --> 01:28:40.070]  Gary Hart talks about it and there's some really great people in the film that we interviewed.
[01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:43.253]  There's definitely someone in the film for every audience member.
[01:28:46.235 --> 01:28:47.196]  I think it's a great film.
[01:28:47.216 --> 01:28:49.338]  I've been sitting in a lot of audiences lately.
[01:28:49.479 --> 01:28:59.268]  I was just in Australia where it premiered in the Sydney Film Festival and I was doing a whole lot of Q&As in LA the last few weeks and audiences are responding incredibly well to the film.
[01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:04.770]  Why do you think so many celebrities and people at the time liked Hunter S. Thompson's writing?
[01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:19.402]  Um, you know, I think if you've read his writing and you're familiar with his writing, it's so, it's so fresh and so unique and so exciting and even now, you know, some of it's, you know, 50 years old and it's, is it 50?
[01:29:19.442 --> 01:29:21.744]  No, you know, 40, 45 years old.
[01:29:22.145 --> 01:29:28.230]  It's so powerful and dynamic and while so many people have tried to copy, you know, his gonzo style,
[01:29:29.429 --> 01:29:41.857]  It still is incredibly fresh, it's honest, it's irreverent, it's funny, it's angry, it's really, it's just so unusual and so dynamic and I think that's what appeals to it.
[01:29:41.897 --> 01:29:46.741]  I mean it's so funny because obviously from my accent people can tell that I'm originally from Australia.
[01:29:46.761 --> 01:29:52.825]  Well I mean I grew up with Hunter S. Thompson books laying around as my mom's a big fan and I read quite a few of them and I do think a lot of it was great info.
[01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:55.987]  I like how he also changed as he got more info.
[01:29:56.427 --> 01:30:00.269]  He clearly at the end knew that the Bush administration was a pedophile cult.
[01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:05.753]  I've talked to his friends and witnesses and people that he wrote things to and he was getting ready to do a big piece on that.
[01:30:05.793 --> 01:30:11.816]  He also began to believe it was a total inside job as other prominent
[01:30:12.677 --> 01:30:13.358]  I think so.
[01:30:29.373 --> 01:30:33.115]  Had woken up to that before he died and so had Kurt Vonnegut.
[01:30:33.435 --> 01:30:35.436]  I just wish they would have said more before they died.
[01:30:35.877 --> 01:30:43.360]  With the material you ran into, did you see him from saying they're going to use us to make us a police state to him then waking up as they blew up the towers?
[01:30:44.421 --> 01:30:50.204]  No, I mean we really didn't go into that and we honestly didn't come across anything like that.
[01:30:50.224 --> 01:30:51.865]  Well let me play an audio clip right now.
[01:30:51.885 --> 01:30:53.246]  Here's Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:30:53.866 --> 01:30:55.447]  This is about a year before he died.
[01:30:55.487 --> 01:30:55.787]  Here it is.
[01:30:56.551 --> 01:31:07.635]  The first question I have is basically to get from you a sense of how you would rate the American media in their coverage of the events of the attack last September.
[01:31:08.136 --> 01:31:11.437]  What's your assessment of how the American media has performed?
[01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:14.138]  Well, let's see.
[01:31:14.918 --> 01:31:21.441]  Shamefully is a word that comes to mind, but that's not true in the case of, well, it depends.
[01:31:23.142 --> 01:31:41.127]  There are papers in the New York Times, Washington Post, but overall the American journalism, I think, has been cowed and intimidated by this massive flag-sucking, this patriotic orgy that the White House keeps whipping up.
[01:31:42.248 --> 01:31:47.529]  You know, if you criticize the President, it's unpatriotic and there's something wrong with you, you may be a terrorist.
[01:31:51.172 --> 01:32:01.779]  I've been raving against this from the very beginning, but I don't have much of a constant national platform now because I've been working on this book, The Kingdom of Fear, which really describes what's going on over here.
[01:32:01.799 --> 01:32:03.100]  The Kingdom of Fear.
[01:32:04.021 --> 01:32:08.364]  So in that sense, Hunter S. Thompson, there's not enough room for dissenting voices?
[01:32:09.665 --> 01:32:10.505]  Well, there's plenty of room.
[01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:12.226]  There's just not enough.
[01:32:12.707 --> 01:32:13.928]  People are willing to take the risk.
[01:32:15.389 --> 01:32:20.332]  It's just sort of a herd mentality, a lemming-like mentality.
[01:32:21.184 --> 01:32:26.668]  If you don't go with the flow, you're anti-American and therefore a suspect.
[01:32:27.428 --> 01:32:29.490]  And we've seen this before, these patriotic frenzies.
[01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:44.239]  Yeah, wartime, you know, they declare, it's very convenient having an undeclared war that you can call a war and impose military tribunals and wartime security.
[01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:48.182]  And then we've got these generals telling us that
[01:32:49.133 --> 01:32:52.015]  This war is going to go on for a long, long time.
[01:32:52.035 --> 01:32:55.377]  Maybe it's not so much the generals now.
[01:32:55.397 --> 01:32:57.619]  The generals are a little afraid to invade Iraq.
[01:32:58.319 --> 01:32:59.060]  A little worried about it.
[01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:01.861]  But it's the civilians in the White House.
[01:33:01.941 --> 01:33:02.402]  It's a gang of
[01:33:03.756 --> 01:33:09.402]  You know, this is a ten minute clip.
[01:33:10.303 --> 01:33:12.745]  I meant to cut it down before air time and I don't think we're going to have time to play it all.
[01:33:12.765 --> 01:33:15.628]  But he goes in and they say, you know, did this help the Bush administration?
[01:33:15.648 --> 01:33:17.050]  He says, absolutely it helped them.
[01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:18.131]  Yeah, it's really suspicious.
[01:33:18.151 --> 01:33:21.835]  And I'm going to post it on the web again at PrisonPlanet.com for folks that want to hear it.
[01:33:22.815 --> 01:33:24.657]  But, and it's actually an hour long interview.
[01:33:24.677 --> 01:33:25.997]  This is a ten minute cut down.
[01:33:26.798 --> 01:33:31.001]  But then, yeah, I talked to one of the editors at a major Canadian paper who was friends with him.
[01:33:31.041 --> 01:33:31.721]  I talked to others.
[01:33:31.781 --> 01:33:36.424]  I got some of his correspondences where he was saying, yeah, they blew those buildings up, controlled demolitions.
[01:33:36.504 --> 01:33:37.625]  I'm going to go public about it.
[01:33:37.665 --> 01:33:39.546]  And then he supposedly committed suicide.
[01:33:39.566 --> 01:33:44.390]  And I know his son was home at the time and didn't see it happen, but said, yeah, it looked like he killed himself.
[01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:49.333]  But obviously, Eva, you've heard the people that are out there who are suspicious.
[01:33:50.093 --> 01:33:55.278]  That Hunter S. Thompson didn't kill himself, though he always talked about how he was going to kill himself.
[01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:59.181]  So, I mean, you think it's pretty clear he didn't kill himself?
[01:33:59.641 --> 01:34:12.012]  Yeah, I mean, we've actually got footage in the film of him with his longtime collaborator and illustrator, Ralph Steadman, when he was quite young, visiting a morgue and pre-planning his funeral with him.
[01:34:12.032 --> 01:34:15.495]  You know, he'd always, always, always talked about killing himself.
[01:34:15.555 --> 01:34:17.637]  When the time was right, it was going to happen.
[01:34:18.821 --> 01:34:23.543]  I don't actually think that there's any evidence to dispute that.
[01:34:23.823 --> 01:34:25.104]  He was at home with his family.
[01:34:25.164 --> 01:34:26.705]  Why did he want to kill himself?
[01:34:26.905 --> 01:34:29.026]  Was that him trying to take control of his life at the end?
[01:34:29.466 --> 01:34:37.570]  I think he'd always had this crazy death wish and he'd always talked about it since he was really young and healthy, but when he died...
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.100]  He was in failing health.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:45.582]  I mean, he was a guy who'd been really, you know, so productive and so amazing and so talented and so successful.
[01:34:45.682 --> 01:34:50.584]  However, he was a huge drinker and a huge drug taker and his health was starting to fail him.
[01:34:50.604 --> 01:34:55.605]  And I just think it just got to a point where he just couldn't take it anymore.
[01:34:55.625 --> 01:34:58.486]  So it was no, you know, it was no huge surprise.
[01:34:58.606 --> 01:35:07.889]  Although all of his longtime amazing friends who talk in the film and family all say something that to me is another really powerful part of the film.
[01:35:08.325 --> 01:35:17.573]  You know, I think that Jimmy Buffett, the really talented musician, actually says, you know, it's fun reminiscing about him, it's fun talking about him, but, you know, I really miss him.
[01:35:17.633 --> 01:35:24.979]  And the most tragic thing is that he could have wielded a pretty powerful sword right now against what's going on in this country.
[01:35:24.999 --> 01:35:29.163]  Well, yeah, so many people respect him that he could have really exposed what happened.
[01:35:29.503 --> 01:35:32.626]  And I think he would have been the type when the Democrats get in and carry out the same tyranny.
[01:35:32.646 --> 01:35:36.589]  I think he would have spoken... He was pretty across the board like that.
[01:35:36.963 --> 01:36:02.731]  And I think also the other thing that I really like about the film whenever I do press screenings and stuff is it sort of feels to me like the end of the film is incredibly inspiring and I feel like it's a call to arms to young journalists to get a bit of gonzo and start asking tough questions and writing articles that are madly critical about what's going on and really start messing with people.
[01:36:05.553 --> 01:36:14.061]  You know, George Bush's press conference that he did yesterday and I was watching the media just asking these incredibly lame questions and just, you know, someone should just...
[01:36:14.574 --> 01:36:16.955]  Someone should just break out and go a little crazy.
[01:36:16.995 --> 01:36:19.235]  Well, that's why I agree.
[01:36:19.255 --> 01:36:19.915]  You've done a great job.
[01:36:19.955 --> 01:36:21.816]  I can't wait to see this film, Taxi to the Dark Side.
[01:36:21.856 --> 01:36:26.197]  I saw that at the Arbor here in Austin and it just blew me away and I bet that's where this is showing.
[01:36:26.637 --> 01:36:31.278]  I kept waiting for it to come out and then suddenly it's the day to interview Eva and I'm like, you informed me it's out.
[01:36:31.938 --> 01:36:36.179]  I'm going to go run off and see it as soon as... I think you'll like it.
[01:36:37.952 --> 01:36:50.608]  Oh, well I was totally blown away by your last film, Tax at the Dark Side, and I do want to try to get the director on as well because he witnessed also so much of the information as well.
[01:36:51.249 --> 01:36:53.111]  What is it like winning an Academy Award?
[01:36:54.633 --> 01:36:55.835]  Oh, it's pretty good fun, Alex.
[01:36:57.313 --> 01:36:59.634]  You can take it, you know, whatever comes.
[01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:09.456]  No, it was a really, you know, magical experience and it was even better and sweeter for us because we made a film that really a lot of people didn't want us to make.
[01:37:09.856 --> 01:37:12.177]  We made a film that was really hard to finance.
[01:37:12.337 --> 01:37:14.897]  You know, most of our films are a lot easier to finance.
[01:37:14.978 --> 01:37:20.599]  No one wanted to put money into it because at the end of the day, you know, at the time everyone was like, who wants to make a film about torture?
[01:37:21.226 --> 01:37:23.188]  That was such sweet vindication.
[01:37:23.609 --> 01:37:30.377]  And also, of all the films nominated, all the feature documentaries nominated this year, ours was by far the darkest.
[01:37:30.518 --> 01:37:37.106]  So it was a real nod from members of the Academy, our filmmaking peers, and the industry.
[01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:40.237]  That's such a dark, challenging film.
[01:37:40.257 --> 01:37:42.998]  Let me elaborate on that.
[01:37:43.018 --> 01:37:44.900]  People criticize me saying I'm being negative.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:45.180]  No.
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.962]  Ignoring these bad things is what is negative.
[01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:55.827]  Enlancing the wound, treating it, admitting these bad things are going on, also gets our name back to a certain extent.
[01:37:55.987 --> 01:38:00.670]  Some of your filmmakers are American, others are from other countries, but we appreciate it.
[01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:04.051]  You know, the fact that this can be exposed so it doesn't continue to happen.
[01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:08.932]  And so how dare those... I know I saw some criticism of this is negative and anti-American.
[01:38:08.992 --> 01:38:09.532]  No, it's not.
[01:38:09.832 --> 01:38:11.992]  Torturing innocent people is un-American.
[01:38:12.012 --> 01:38:12.773]  Exactly.
[01:38:13.253 --> 01:38:13.933]  Exactly.
[01:38:13.953 --> 01:38:22.815]  You know, and the great thing about the film, too, is it's going to screen on HBO uncut in September, just before the elections, which is really, I think, going to be fantastic.
[01:38:22.835 --> 01:38:24.155]  And I think it'll get a lot of exposure.
[01:38:24.861 --> 01:38:25.984]  Oh, so that's really exciting.
[01:38:26.285 --> 01:38:33.661]  And, you know, the other thing that was, we made it, gosh, we finished it about, well over a year ago, so, you know, we started making it like three years ago.
[01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:43.364]  One of my concerns at the time, which now is so bittersweetly funny, but one of my concerns was, God, what if this is just incredibly irrelevant by the time it comes out?
[01:38:43.404 --> 01:38:44.224]  What if it's all over?
[01:38:44.264 --> 01:38:45.664]  What if Guantanamo is closed?
[01:38:45.724 --> 01:38:49.226]  What if this isn't a discussion anymore?
[01:38:49.926 --> 01:39:00.449]  This morning I was driving to an appointment and I was listening to NPR and Jane Mayer, who was a huge help in the film, she's a New Yorker journalist who broke a lot of stories about torture,
[01:39:01.431 --> 01:39:10.234]  Um, over the last couple of years, he's just put a book out that's called The Dark Side, and it's, you know, it's really... And now we've got them... It's our film.
[01:39:10.414 --> 01:39:10.754]  Exactly.
[01:39:10.794 --> 01:39:13.115]  Now we have the Red Cross coming out and saying war crimes.
[01:39:13.475 --> 01:39:22.898]  Now the gauntlet's down to the establishment, um, not the American Red Cross, International Red Cross folks, different folks, saying, you did this, you need to be punished.
[01:39:23.298 --> 01:39:25.659]  Final segment with Eva Orner, straight ahead.
[01:39:25.719 --> 01:39:28.059]  She is an Academy Award winner for Taxi to the Dark Side.
[01:39:28.279 --> 01:39:29.720]  We'll talk about that film when we get back.
[01:39:32.674 --> 01:39:34.255]  Let me talk to Eva real fast.
[01:39:35.355 --> 01:39:35.956]  Uh, hey, Eva.
[01:39:36.276 --> 01:39:42.459]  It's called The Dark Side and it's, you know, it's really, you know, along the same lines as our film.
[01:39:42.739 --> 01:39:43.060]  Exactly.
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:45.421]  Now we have the Red Cross coming out and saying war crimes.
[01:39:45.801 --> 01:39:55.226]  Now the gauntlet's down to the establishment, um, not the American Red Cross, International Red Cross folks, different folks, saying you did this, you need to be punished.
[01:39:55.606 --> 01:39:57.988]  Final segment with Eva Orner straight ahead.
[01:39:58.048 --> 01:40:00.369]  She is an Academy Award winner for Taxi to the Dark Side.
[01:40:00.589 --> 01:40:02.030]  We'll talk about that film when we get back.
[01:40:06.713 --> 01:40:09.635]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[01:40:10.115 --> 01:40:14.218]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[01:40:14.939 --> 01:40:16.640]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?

[01:41:05.796 --> 01:41:09.217]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:41:09.397 --> 01:41:11.237]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:41:11.857 --> 01:41:14.578]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:41:14.898 --> 01:41:20.360]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.

[01:42:21.742 --> 01:42:26.144]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:42:28.806 --> 01:42:29.246]  I think so.
[01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:54.781]  I've been interviewed by a couple of mainstream TV networks, Discovery Channel, History Channel.
[01:42:55.462 --> 01:42:59.346]  Not Discovery, it was History and somebody else and they've been real mean to us.
[01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:03.831]  So she called up and said, we're with Discovery Channel and I was like yelling at her meanly.
[01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:07.675]  She still turned the other cheek and they turned out to be great folks.
[01:43:10.137 --> 01:43:11.318]  Making so many big films.
[01:43:11.378 --> 01:43:14.620]  Gonzo is the one in theaters across the country right now.
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:15.460]  You'll want to go see that.
[01:43:15.841 --> 01:43:22.025]  And she was just telling me during the break that Taxi the Dark Side is going to be screening on HBO in the next few months.
[01:43:22.465 --> 01:43:23.946]  She'll give us the exact date in a moment.
[01:43:23.986 --> 01:43:24.846]  You want to see this.
[01:43:24.886 --> 01:43:26.047]  It's very disturbing though.
[01:43:26.067 --> 01:43:28.149]  I mean, you want to see her.
[01:43:28.169 --> 01:43:28.929]  They're torturing her to death.
[01:43:28.949 --> 01:43:29.610]  You'll get a chance.
[01:43:30.569 --> 01:43:36.437]  Young men, young kids, totally innocent, the sickos they had doing it, the orders to do it.
[01:43:37.158 --> 01:43:39.541]  And then it's going to be on DVD, and I'm going to get a hold of these.
[01:43:39.601 --> 01:43:42.705]  I'm going to have these on the website, but they'll be in stores as well.
[01:43:42.725 --> 01:43:43.826]  You need to show this to everybody.
[01:43:44.347 --> 01:43:47.331]  Eva Orner, do you have the exact date of when it's going to be screening on HBO?
[01:43:47.791 --> 01:43:59.516]  I actually don't, but it's going to be definitely September in their show, and they're going to be screening it uncut, and there'll be a lot of publicity surrounding it, and then after it screens on HBO, it'll be widely available on DVD.
[01:43:59.697 --> 01:44:00.417]  By uncut?
[01:44:00.457 --> 01:44:01.958]  Is that more hardcore than the theater?
[01:44:02.658 --> 01:44:09.101]  No, it's the theater cut, but you know, I think a lot of networks, the reason we love that HBO is showing it is because they're going to show it uncut, and it is.
[01:44:09.545 --> 01:44:14.828]  It's definitely challenging and there are definitely disturbing scenes in it.
[01:44:15.108 --> 01:44:18.110]  You've got some video and photos that were never put on the news, folks.
[01:44:18.150 --> 01:44:19.330]  Some of this is XXX.
[01:44:20.151 --> 01:44:21.871]  And we don't mean that in a good way.
[01:44:22.532 --> 01:44:28.035]  We had amazing access and incredible researchers and we got a lot of footage that nobody's seen before.
[01:44:29.295 --> 01:44:31.977]  It's definitely a disturbing and thought-provoking film.
[01:44:32.097 --> 01:44:34.459]  Yeah, folks, you'll actually be inside the torture pits.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.041]  Not the sanitized stuff you saw on the news.
[01:44:37.101 --> 01:44:41.125]  I know that's horrible to say, but you think it's cute seeing movies like Hostile and stuff.
[01:44:41.165 --> 01:44:42.486]  It's not cute, it's not funny.
[01:44:42.786 --> 01:44:44.107]  You need to see Taxi the Dark Side.
[01:44:44.988 --> 01:44:48.511]  In closing, you've had a lot of courage.
[01:44:49.231 --> 01:44:51.253]  Is it fulfilling to know you're really doing good in the world, Eva?
[01:44:52.361 --> 01:44:58.685]  You know, it's really good at a time like this when the world doesn't feel like the greatest place in my lifetime anyway.
[01:44:58.765 --> 01:45:07.010]  It feels good to be making stuff that is thought-provoking and challenging and provocative and makes a difference, you know, in some small way.
[01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:10.452]  Yeah, it's really inspiring and that's the sort of stuff that I'm
[01:45:11.115 --> 01:45:12.256]  I hope to continue to do.
[01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:32.530]  Nothing more beautiful.
[01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:42.893]  We're going to get your director of Taxi to the Dark Side, Ann Gonzo, on because I can also interview him about his Enron film, The Smartest Guys in the Room, and that's going to be interesting as well.
[01:45:43.093 --> 01:45:46.214]  Give us some of the websites for your film company or any other info.
[01:45:49.135 --> 01:45:54.117]  The website for Alex Gibney's company is jigsawprods.com.
[01:45:56.279 --> 01:46:08.286]  And there's the website for the Hunter S. Thompson movie, which is, I believe, HunterThompsonMovie.com, where you can see the trailer and read all about it and read the press kit.
[01:46:08.306 --> 01:46:13.108]  But if you just Google Hunter S. Thompson film, you'll find a lot of information as well.
[01:46:13.148 --> 01:46:15.730]  The trailer's everywhere and there's lots and lots of reviews.
[01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:16.890]  Alright, E. Moore?
[01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:21.173]  And also, same with Taxi to the Dark Side, just Google it and you'll find lots of
[01:46:22.273 --> 01:46:23.234]  Interesting information.
[01:46:23.975 --> 01:46:27.418]  And by the way, Johnny Depp is narrating the new Gonzo film.
[01:46:27.939 --> 01:46:29.020]  Yeah, and he's in it as well.
[01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:30.641]  He's interviewed as well.
[01:46:30.761 --> 01:46:31.582]  He's pretty terrific.
[01:46:31.882 --> 01:46:32.623]  Yeah, neat guy.
[01:46:33.044 --> 01:46:35.306]  Okay, thank you so much for spending time with us, Eva.
[01:46:35.871 --> 01:46:36.672]  That's crazy Alex.
[01:46:36.752 --> 01:46:37.292]  Take care.
[01:46:37.632 --> 01:46:37.933]  You bet.
[01:46:37.953 --> 01:46:39.314]  I'm going to go see her movie and then call you back.
[01:46:39.674 --> 01:46:40.375]  What a sweet lady.
[01:46:40.395 --> 01:46:41.115]  What a smart lady.
[01:46:41.596 --> 01:46:42.276]  We're out of time.
[01:46:42.556 --> 01:46:43.397]  John, say bye to her.
[01:46:44.278 --> 01:46:45.939]  We are out of here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:56.748]  Speaking of my film, which has no voiceover from Alex Jones and is amazing and shows you who the truth movement is, how 9-11 is an inside job, how the first responders aren't getting treatment.
[01:46:56.768 --> 01:46:57.769]  It is truth rising.
[01:46:58.249 --> 01:46:59.450]  It needs to be seen.
[01:46:59.811 --> 01:47:03.614]  PrisonPlanet.tv, watch it right now or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:03.994 --> 01:47:10.240]  Retransmission starts now with all the big guests we had on today at InfoWars.com for the audio streams.
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:11.261]  God bless you all.
