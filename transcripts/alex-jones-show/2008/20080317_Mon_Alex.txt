[00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.913]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:11.394]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:13.055]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:17.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:21.982]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.991]  It is the 17th day of March 2008.
[00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:41.173]  Beware the Ides of March, they say.
[00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:43.494]  A very unlucky month in history.
[00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:47.916]  It's when armies go on the march.
[00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:50.257]  It's the month of Mars, of war.
[00:00:51.797 --> 00:00:54.058]  We're going to be live here again for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:59.240]  This is a massive, totally jam-packed broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:10.334]  We have Arjun Tenzin joining us from India, where the Tibetan government is in exile.
[00:01:10.394 --> 00:01:15.017]  He is the director of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, with the Dalai Lama.
[00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:21.662]  We're going to cover the mass murder and tyranny that's going on there, as our government fully supports it, criminally.
[00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:27.886]  Daniel Sanjata, of course, star of screen, stage and film, television.
[00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:39.087]  Really upset and angry about Geraldo Rivera coming out and demonizing 9-11 truthers and saying that we're behind bombings and now we have other evidence of attempted set-ups in New York.
[00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.392]  The star of Rescue Me will be joining us for 30 minutes in one hour.
[00:01:44.952 --> 00:01:52.019]  Barbara Penninger, whose parents have gone into hospice and they're trying to basically euthanize them.
[00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:59.729]  And then Bob Chapman from International Forecaster will be with us in the third hour covering the financial news.
[00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.373]  We're going to get into financial news after the 15-20 minute coverage coming up of what's happening in Tibet.
[00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:07.814]  But people are losing their lives.
[00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:09.335]  They're under martial law.
[00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:15.019]  The Communist Chinese are just absolutely corrupt aggressors in all of this.
[00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:19.608]  And we're going to be breaking down the inside scoop on what's going on there.
[00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.272]  And the 80-plus dead as of last night, the numbers are only growing.
[00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:37.983]  So that's coming up from the Dalai Lama's government in exile in India, right next door to Tibet there, just east of them, there on the western side.
[00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:46.148]  You always think of Tibet above China, because it's the roof of the world, but it's really to the western side of China.
[00:02:46.588 --> 00:02:48.649]  They're bordering with India.
[00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:51.892]  Obviously, the economic news.
[00:02:51.952 --> 00:02:55.054]  I'm going to attempt to be as calm as possible at the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.817]  After we cover Tibet, I'm just going to walk through what's happening.
[00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:01.319]  Our worst fears are being realized.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.303]  I could barely sleep last night, even though I've been up since 6.30 a.m.
[00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:07.664]  the previous morning.
[00:03:08.991 --> 00:03:27.971]  I tossed and turned all last night, and you're not going to see fireworks today or tomorrow or next week or next month, but what has now happened are grievous, irreversible wounds in the financial structure, and it is going to mean that we are going to have a depression.
[00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:31.555]  We are going to have a depression now.
[00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.606]  And we had tried to reverse it.
[00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:37.748]  We tried to politically get people motivated to blame the New World Order.
[00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:39.669]  They would have backed off and not done this.
[00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.832]  But 99% chance we're going to have a full-born, full-blown depression.
[00:03:48.793 --> 00:03:51.554]  I mean, Grapes of Wrath, the whole nine yards.
[00:03:51.635 --> 00:03:58.418]  But back then, in the Grapes of Wrath, you didn't have the government swooping in and grabbing your children.
[00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:08.211]  This is all designed, and it is going to be really sick, and I've been saying it, hell is being released.
[00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:09.792]  Well, hell has been released.
[00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:25.321]  I watched him opening the black gates and releasing the titan out of its pit, the financial titan of financial ruin, and he's now left the pit, and he is now engaging the people.
[00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:33.312]  Meanwhile, Bush is doing his job, telling everybody, lay down, everything's fine, everything's wonderful.
[00:04:34.312 --> 00:04:39.596]  The government loves you, as they engage in the purposeful implosion.
[00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:45.180]  Coming up, Dollar Nosedive stirs joint intervention jitters.
[00:04:46.398 --> 00:04:49.219]  Dollar tumbles after Fed's weekend action.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.701]  Gold hits $1,030 an ounce.
[00:04:53.181 --> 00:04:56.082]  Huge brokerage firms go bankrupt one after another.
[00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.303]  Domino effect now in frame.
[00:04:58.724 --> 00:05:00.585]  It's all coming up after we go to Tibet.
[00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:03.306]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:05.427]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.147 --> 00:05:09.769]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:13.818]  It's known as the Bilderberg Theory.
[00:05:13.858 --> 00:05:16.100]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.082]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.822 --> 00:05:27.207]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.133]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.613 --> 00:05:39.115]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:42.016]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.056 --> 00:05:43.016]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.036 --> 00:05:43.957]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:45.037]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:45.698]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.718 --> 00:05:46.938]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:05:47.418 --> 00:05:55.602]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:55.762 --> 00:05:58.763]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:58.923 --> 00:06:00.064]  You have been warned.
[00:06:01.563 --> 00:06:02.723]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:05.124]  I'm seeing a new Dramatical Report here on Genesis.
[00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:08.225]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals, U.S.
[00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:08.985]  is a real thing.
[00:06:09.045 --> 00:06:15.907]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh and never before available garlic.
[00:06:16.047 --> 00:06:21.328]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:06:21.508 --> 00:06:22.248]  We're good to go!
[00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:51.643]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.

[00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.408]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:07:00.794 --> 00:07:07.339]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, radical changes need to be implemented if we're to avert becoming a third world nation.
[00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.302]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health solutions.
[00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:14.283]  Introducing Oregon Products.

[00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:32.316]  Wilhelm Reich Oregon uses cloud buster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic energy savings of up to 25%.

[00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:13.477]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.638 --> 00:08:18.259]  As we speak, the Supreme Court is moving to declare the Second Amendment dead.
[00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:27.962]  Chris Matthews is calling for basic gun bans and checkpoints, like in the airports, to disarm American citizens.
[00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:35.327]  The San Francisco Chronicle and Houston Chronicle reported FEMA camps have been built for the American people.
[00:08:36.668 --> 00:08:38.669]  Bear Stearns has basically gone bankrupt.
[00:08:38.689 --> 00:08:40.389]  The Carlisle Group has gone bankrupt.
[00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.750]  A domino effect has now been triggered.
[00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.551]  Just as we predicted it would.
[00:08:45.432 --> 00:08:52.635]  Fiscal Armageddon, Financial Armageddon, we'll be documenting all that coming up in about 22 minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:57.297]  This is one of the most important broadcasts we've ever done.
[00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:13.061]  Now, we're about to be joined by the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy director, and that is the main group fighting for Tibetan liberation, and he is the director, Ergen Tenzin.
[00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:22.368]  There are few cases where brazen, unadulterated wars of aggression are more obvious than in the case of the peaceful Tibetans.
[00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:27.752]  Now, of course, killed 60 million of his own people.
[00:09:29.435 --> 00:09:33.196]  In 1950, Chinese troops, the People's Liberation Army, under Mao Zedong marched into Tibet.
[00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:39.958]  And basically set up a dictatorship.
[00:09:39.998 --> 00:09:44.060]  Then in 1959, they just howitzer all of the main temples into dust.
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.361]  And they rolled cannons up the defenseless people and just slaughtered hundreds of thousands.
[00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:53.987]  They force Tibetan women to marry Chinese men to eradicate them.
[00:09:54.347 --> 00:09:58.088]  They also fully enforce one child, sterilizing women after one baby.
[00:09:58.388 --> 00:10:00.189]  They kind of wink-wink and China proper.
[00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:03.190]  They don't give preferential loans to the Tibetans.
[00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.251]  They give them to them in very high interest rates.
[00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:08.732]  The Tibetans are basically being exterminated.
[00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:12.653]  There's very small amounts of them left, what there was, barely hanging on.
[00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:14.694]  You don't hear in the news why all this started.
[00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:27.378]  The big anniversary of their invasion, the Communist Chinese murderous invasion, just coming into a totally sovereign nation, one of the oldest countries in the world, Tibet, and they came in.
[00:10:27.398 --> 00:10:29.259]  I'm going to give you some background before we go to our guest.
[00:10:31.481 --> 00:10:33.563]  And it's just been a reign of genocide and terror.
[00:10:33.783 --> 00:10:35.384]  Kind of accelerated what the U.S.
[00:10:35.444 --> 00:10:36.405]  did to the Native Americans.
[00:10:37.045 --> 00:10:40.748]  But it's been accelerated, and much more successful in a quicker time frame.
[00:10:43.073 --> 00:10:48.315]  And the big news here is, in the past, our government would decry this and say China was bad.
[00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:49.055]  They don't now.
[00:10:50.575 --> 00:11:08.100]  And our media is not telling you, it's in the foreign press and it's confirmed, that on the anniversary of the Communist Chinese takeover, they like to go around and randomly arrest hundreds of people, and the Tibetans finally got tired of having their doors knocked down at night and drug off to be killed or tortured, or have their organs taken.
[00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:16.731]  And so the Tibetans finally went out in the streets and started burning down some of the government buildings and things.
[00:11:17.332 --> 00:11:27.655]  Okay, joining us is the director from India, where they're in exile, of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, Erjun Tenzin.
[00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:28.776]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:30.096]  Hello.
[00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:33.869]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:38.791]  Tell us about the center, what you do, and in a nutshell, what's happening in Tibet.
[00:11:39.072 --> 00:11:40.913]  We're now told the death toll is way above 80.
[00:11:43.254 --> 00:11:52.459]  Well, actually, the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy is the primary Tibetan NGO documenting the human rights abuses taking place in Tibet.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:00.143]  And for the last more than a decade, we have been documenting various forms of human rights violations taking place in Tibet.
[00:12:01.624 --> 00:12:12.292]  We have been issuing various updates from time to time to the international community about all the human rights violations that have been taking place over decades of Chinese rule in Tibet.
[00:12:13.713 --> 00:12:20.818]  And as the world now knows, like so far, Tibet has always been very silent.
[00:12:21.838 --> 00:12:31.684]  And the last protests that took place on a mass scale were in late 1980s, to be precise, 87, 88, 89, and early 1991 and 2.
[00:12:32.505 --> 00:12:45.033]  After that, the Chinese have been clamping down upon the Tibetans, and there was no protest to take place at all, because the tyranny was so bad that nobody dared to speak out.
[00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:53.072]  Anyone who was speaking out would be thrown into jail for about 10 to 12 to 15 to life imprisonment, so nobody dared to speak out.
[00:12:53.412 --> 00:13:07.699]  But because of this deep, deep resentment which has been created by the Chinese authorities in Tibet over decades now, now the Tibetan people are again coming onto the street and showing their protest.
[00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:11.261]  As you know now, since the 10th of March, which is the Tibetan Uprising Day,
[00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:23.803]  Monks in hundreds, in thousands, have come onto the streets, beginning from Lhasa, where the monks of the three great monasteries have come to the streets and protested against the Chinese authorities in Tibet.
[00:13:24.163 --> 00:13:27.766]  And the monks were thrown back into their monasteries and the monasteries sealed.
[00:13:28.046 --> 00:13:33.751]  Thereafter, ordinary people joined by the smaller monasteries, they also came into the streets.
[00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:39.075]  And when the protests in Lhasa, they were being brutally crushed, and
[00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:48.383]  And the security forces, they were going like house-to-house raids to pick up all the suspected protesters.
[00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:52.265]  Basically, they were picking up all the young men in these families.
[00:13:52.645 --> 00:14:01.208]  We have been receiving testimonies of crying mothers and elderly in the families saying that their young sons are being dragged away, beaten by the security forces.
[00:14:01.429 --> 00:14:06.571]  We don't know how many have been carried away right now, but we're estimating anywhere around 600 plus.
[00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:17.213]  And, according to information that we have been receiving so far, the protests have spread like a wildfire in the whole of Tibet now.
[00:14:17.713 --> 00:14:29.715]  Say, in northeastern Tibet, in various, various parts in northeastern Tibet, what the Tibetans traditionally know as Angol region, there are protests, mass-scale protests taking place everywhere.
[00:14:30.315 --> 00:14:36.076]  When I say mass-scale, it's about 5,000 plus Tibetans coming onto the streets and protesting against the Chinese rule in Tibet.
[00:14:37.296 --> 00:14:53.930]  Yesterday, we have been receiving pictures of the Chinese police shooting indiscriminately into the protesters and as a result, at least, at least, 15 dead bodies have been brought into a local monastery and people fear that about 30 plus have already been killed.
[00:14:54.451 --> 00:14:55.972]  Well, sir, go ahead.
[00:14:56.212 --> 00:14:57.113]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:07.013]  Hello, this morning also we have been receiving information that there are protests still going on in various parts of Tibet, especially in the northeastern Tibet region.
[00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:10.054]  There are now students protesting coming out.
[00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:18.998]  The students have been peacefully protesting, and even for them, like middle school students, about 40 have been rounded off and taken to police stations.
[00:15:19.278 --> 00:15:21.519]  We have university students also protesting.
[00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:25.501]  And right now, about two hours ago,
[00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:31.813]  Tibetan students in the Chinese capital, Beijing, they are also facing a solidarity protest there.
[00:15:32.733 --> 00:15:35.695]  That incredible peril, we know what happened in Tiananmen Square.
[00:15:36.156 --> 00:15:46.202]  Again, we're talking to the director of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, the main organization politically fighting for the Tibetan people.
[00:15:46.903 --> 00:15:49.865]  The genocide is ongoing against your fine people.
[00:15:50.735 --> 00:16:05.706]  And it's so sad to see this, even most Chinese don't like what their government has been doing to you, but they've been bringing in historical subgroups and rivals that have lived near you to usurp and take you over.
[00:16:05.966 --> 00:16:12.530]  I want to be clear, AP, Reuters and others are reporting 80 plus dead, but you sounded like you're saying it's around 50 or so?
[00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:26.533]  Yes, from whatever we could confirm at the moment, according to our confirmed information that we have been able to document at the moment, we are counting the death toll as 55 absolutely confirmed.
[00:16:27.593 --> 00:16:33.155]  Okay, but I would imagine the international press is probably maybe one step ahead of you, though you have a lot of sources inside Tibet.
[00:16:33.435 --> 00:16:39.317]  How are you, you know, we've seen the cell phone camera videos, we've seen a few of those getting out, we're seeing less and less of those.
[00:16:40.197 --> 00:16:42.718]  How are you still able to get information out of Tibet?
[00:16:44.116 --> 00:16:52.104]  Well, actually, it's through the marvels of technology nowadays that we have been able to receive information.
[00:16:52.124 --> 00:17:01.973]  No matter how strict the authorities tend to be, there is always a bravery element and some brave
[00:17:02.609 --> 00:17:30.909]  brain element and it is a combination of these like the people inside Tibet they also know that that's the risk that they are taking and we also know that what sort of risk that they are taking but despite the risk as we already know like China does not tolerate any kind of reporting to the outside world but these are like now like the last resort south to the outside world like putting themselves at on risk
[00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:33.135]  Absolutely.
[00:17:33.155 --> 00:17:38.457]  As you say, it's part courage, part brainpower, part ingenuity, part brainpower, part muscle power.
[00:17:39.997 --> 00:17:44.618]  Now, what do you expect the communist Chinese oppressors to do now?
[00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:59.122]  Do you believe that there were these spontaneous demonstrations because the people knew in Tibet that the Olympics were coming and that this was your chance to bring attention to the genocide that's going on?
[00:17:59.522 --> 00:18:01.603]  Or why did all of this start?
[00:18:02.952 --> 00:18:03.732]  Well, exactly.
[00:18:03.753 --> 00:18:10.657]  As I said before, there's a deep-seated resentment by the Tibetan people against the authorities.
[00:18:11.017 --> 00:18:16.940]  And nobody has been able to speak up in the last at least two decades when the last big protest happened.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.603]  So for two decades, the Tibetans have been suppressing their sentiments.
[00:18:23.145 --> 00:18:47.627]  Despite the tight clampdown by the authorities, and with now the Olympics coming on, the spotlight being on Beijing, and of course, Tibetans in exile also marching back into Tibet, it's an inspiration and it's an opportunity to perfectly highlight the Tibetan cause to the outside world.
[00:18:48.286 --> 00:19:00.669]  Well, how cowardly is it for the Chinese military to shoot people in the streets who are there, in many cases, peacefully demonstrating, and then after they start shooting them, as what we've seen, then they start burning things.
[00:19:00.689 --> 00:19:05.690]  I mean, how cowardly is it for the Chinese military to shoot unarmed civilians?
[00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.550]  They're also doing it all over China.
[00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.131]  China itself is having more and more resistance.
[00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:13.211]  So, can you speak to the cowardliness of shooting at unarmed people?
[00:19:13.471 --> 00:19:16.592]  But also, it's not just a rebellion against tyranny in Tibet.
[00:19:16.892 --> 00:19:22.635]  The rebellion is intensifying in Chinese-held areas across the Chinese mainland.
[00:19:23.715 --> 00:19:24.156]  Exactly.
[00:19:24.176 --> 00:19:35.041]  The use of arms and ammunition by the paramilitary troops, by the various Chinese security forces, it does not show their might.
[00:19:35.301 --> 00:19:36.502]  It does not show their guns.
[00:19:36.602 --> 00:19:38.283]  It does not show their latest guns.
[00:19:38.403 --> 00:19:42.285]  It just shows how weak that they are deep within.
[00:19:43.005 --> 00:19:56.475]  In order to use that brand new gun on an innocent Tibetan, peacefully shouting for his rights, peacefully participating in a demonstration, peacefully holding a channel light, and asking... Stay there, sir, stay there.
[00:19:56.535 --> 00:19:58.997]  The Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy Director.
[00:19:59.277 --> 00:20:00.518]  Final segment straight ahead with you.
[00:20:01.959 --> 00:20:03.381]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:03.401 --> 00:20:05.502]  A new world order.
[00:20:06.203 --> 00:20:10.006]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by power.
[00:20:11.098 --> 00:20:12.840]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:16.062]  Put their objection to the world domination.
[00:20:16.703 --> 00:20:19.145]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:27.252]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:20:30.235 --> 00:20:35.199]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:20:35.679 --> 00:20:39.140]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.061]  Build a very good space to make progress for the world, government.
[00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:43.242]  Most people have no idea.
[00:20:43.262 --> 00:20:44.022]  They're not after money.
[00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:45.122]  They have all the money they need.
[00:20:45.342 --> 00:20:46.082]  They're after power.
[00:20:46.303 --> 00:20:48.063]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:55.666]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:56.706]  Endgame.
[00:20:56.986 --> 00:20:58.947]  Only prepped for global enslavement.
[00:20:58.987 --> 00:21:00.087]  You have been warned.
[00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:03.591]  I think so.
[00:21:25.168 --> 00:21:25.888]  We're good to go.
[00:21:49.757 --> 00:21:50.538]  We're good.
[00:22:01.101 --> 00:22:02.802]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:22:03.102 --> 00:22:06.563]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.624]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:22:08.644 --> 00:22:11.945]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:22:12.245 --> 00:22:17.747]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:22:18.027 --> 00:22:21.968]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:22:22.308 --> 00:22:27.231]  In the Infowar, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:22:27.531 --> 00:22:30.313]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[00:22:59.605 --> 00:23:00.986]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:02.206]  It's a fact.
[00:23:02.406 --> 00:23:13.108]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest
[00:23:13.148 --> 00:23:13.528]  I'm good.

[00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.799]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:24:00.819 --> 00:24:03.180]  Tibet is their country.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:09.143]  The Communist Chinese are evil in every book.
[00:24:27.094 --> 00:24:29.556]  They killed 60 million, conservatively, of their own people.
[00:24:30.517 --> 00:24:32.239]  They killed masses of Tibetans.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.522]  Their government, their military are a bunch of criminal dirtbags.
[00:24:38.384 --> 00:24:45.490]  And what's really bad is that our government is now neutral on this, and going, look at the police, deal with those troublemakers.
[00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.812]  I bet most American cops think it's bad.
[00:24:48.172 --> 00:24:49.393]  They think the Tibetans are bad now.
[00:24:49.614 --> 00:24:51.095]  Again, evil is good today.
[00:24:51.715 --> 00:24:52.616]  No, it's not good.
[00:24:53.817 --> 00:24:54.598]  And the good news is,
[00:24:56.044 --> 00:25:04.175]  The people are standing up, and we're talking about the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy director, Ergen Tinzin.
[00:25:04.476 --> 00:25:09.723]  Sir, in closing, people are also starting to revolt in China proper, too, aren't they?
[00:25:11.089 --> 00:25:11.869]  Yes, exactly.
[00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:17.993]  There are lots of issues that have been unaddressed by the government of China.
[00:25:18.373 --> 00:25:26.638]  So, it's not only in Tibet, it's also in Xinjiang, it's also in Inner Mongolia, it's also in mainland China itself.
[00:25:26.959 --> 00:25:31.681]  It's also in Beijing that the people are now standing up against the government.
[00:25:31.902 --> 00:25:37.505]  There are issues of religious freedom, there are issues of housing rights, there are issues of
[00:25:38.498 --> 00:25:43.354]  Health and there are issues of migrant workers and there's a whole plethora of issues.
[00:25:44.574 --> 00:25:47.036]  Absolutely, and tyranny is on the run globally.
[00:25:47.076 --> 00:25:49.118]  That's why it's trying to move against free humanity.
[00:25:49.558 --> 00:25:57.464]  And I want you to know we stand with the Tibetan people and we pray for your liberty and your future liberation against the New World Order.
[00:25:58.465 --> 00:26:00.927]  How do you see this playing out in the days and weeks?
[00:26:00.987 --> 00:26:04.730]  What do you see unfolding in Tibet right now?
[00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.331]  They've expelled all the foreigners.
[00:26:06.612 --> 00:26:07.472]  They're clamping down.
[00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.353]  What do you see happening?
[00:26:09.705 --> 00:26:28.781]  Well, according to the local time, midnight, which is in about now, in about 5 or 10 minutes, now the authorities' initial order for the protesters to voluntarily surrender to the authorities is now meeting its deadline.
[00:26:28.801 --> 00:26:33.966]  So in about 5 or 10 minutes, the order will close its deadline and then they will again
[00:26:34.866 --> 00:26:47.278]  That's right, they're saying if they turn themselves in, they'll be lenient, meaning they'll only put them in a slave camp for 10 years instead of injecting them with poison, right?
[00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:48.981]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:26:49.001 --> 00:26:54.244]  So it's just a tactic to fool the protesters, you know.
[00:26:54.544 --> 00:26:57.505]  You come in and then, you know, we are going to give you leniency.
[00:26:57.525 --> 00:26:58.346]  That's what they are saying.
[00:26:58.386 --> 00:26:59.626]  But it's not going to be like that.
[00:26:59.666 --> 00:27:01.007]  We have seen it in the past also.
[00:27:01.307 --> 00:27:09.891]  During those big demonstrations in the late 80s also that, you know, like they have been coming after each and every individual and they have thrown thousands during that time into the jail.
[00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:11.592]  And people have been suffering and suffering.
[00:27:12.652 --> 00:27:19.897]  You know, since that last demonstration in the late 80s, there are still some individuals who are still serving their term.
[00:27:21.638 --> 00:27:23.699]  Well, you know, they also execute a lot of people.
[00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:25.220]  Exactly.
[00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:35.406]  What about a website, your organization, for people that want to donate or support or spread the word as you fight against the vicious beast of the Communist Chinese?
[00:27:35.746 --> 00:27:37.087]  How do we support a free Tibet?
[00:27:38.391 --> 00:27:49.253]  Well, you can always follow the happenings inside Tibet through our website, which is www.tphrd.org.
[00:27:49.313 --> 00:27:53.754]  Let me repeat, www.tphrd.org.
[00:27:54.154 --> 00:28:05.417]  So, we have been getting news updates and pictures and mobile phone clips and everything, and we have been following the situation inside Tibet intensely, and whatever the information that we could
[00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:09.660]  Double check and verify and confirm we upload onto a website.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:18.027]  And at the moment, as we noticed from the web sheets also, like in the last four or five days, it's jumped a lot.
[00:28:18.347 --> 00:28:24.012]  And we request the people to follow the news with us also on our organization's website.
[00:28:25.348 --> 00:28:26.089]  Absolutely!
[00:28:26.189 --> 00:28:29.191]  Executive Director, Mr. Erdzin Tenzin.
[00:28:29.651 --> 00:28:31.252]  You can see his picture up on their site.
[00:28:31.272 --> 00:28:34.034]  A lot of photos, documents, articles about what's really happening.
[00:28:34.355 --> 00:28:36.316]  It's a hardcore source for real news.
[00:28:36.776 --> 00:28:39.478]  T-C-H-R-D dot O-R-G.
[00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:42.340]  T-C-H-R-D dot O-R-G.
[00:28:42.881 --> 00:28:46.443]  That, of course, is the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy.
[00:28:46.723 --> 00:28:50.306]  Wherever the iron fist of tyranny is smashing into free humanity,
[00:28:50.846 --> 00:28:55.228]  This broadcast will be there facing that tyranny down in whatever way we can.
[00:28:55.588 --> 00:29:11.413]  We ask you, the listeners, to be in heart, mind, and spirit with the Tibetan people who are just being exterminated for the last 50 plus years by the beast of the Red Communist Chinese that our government has now sickeningly embraced as they bring us into the New World Order.
[00:29:11.453 --> 00:29:16.935]  We face what the Tibetans face very soon here as the tyranny envelops the United States.
[00:29:17.815 --> 00:29:21.278]  As things develop during the week, sir, I'd like to have you pop back in.
[00:29:21.358 --> 00:29:24.681]  Thank you for spending time with us, and go with God.
[00:29:25.442 --> 00:29:26.283]  Thank you, thank you.
[00:29:26.703 --> 00:29:27.163]  Take care.
[00:29:27.804 --> 00:29:29.966]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, again that website, TCHRD.org.
[00:29:30.266 --> 00:29:31.127]  TCHRD.org.
[00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:39.761]  They are under total tyranny right now.
[00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:45.768]  They are fighting back with sticks and stones against tanks, armored vehicles, and scum with machine guns.
[00:29:46.109 --> 00:29:49.292]  And you look at those Chinese soldiers, they just look completely demonic.
[00:29:51.695 --> 00:29:52.616]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.097 --> 00:29:54.698]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.323]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.894 --> 00:30:03.735]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:03.875 --> 00:30:10.578]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:30:10.838 --> 00:30:19.021]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:25.023]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:25.143 --> 00:30:26.904]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:26.984 --> 00:30:28.865]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:28.925 --> 00:30:33.530]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.833]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:30:35.933 --> 00:30:43.682]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:30:43.882 --> 00:30:45.483]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:51.427]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:30:51.467 --> 00:30:56.029]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened,
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.181]  And how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.

[00:32:01.047 --> 00:32:03.990]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:09.356]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:32:09.677 --> 00:32:14.962]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:15.383 --> 00:32:16.444]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:16.864 --> 00:32:25.927]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:33:08.832 --> 00:33:10.833]  Yeah, they build the big guns.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:15.575]  Yeah, they build the death planes.
[00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:19.477]  Yeah, they build all the bombs.
[00:33:21.858 --> 00:33:24.360]  Yeah, they hide behind walls.
[00:33:26.161 --> 00:33:28.102]  Yeah, they hide behind desks.
[00:33:30.423 --> 00:33:34.645]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:43.335]  You that never done nothing but build to destroy.
[00:33:45.777 --> 00:33:51.923]  You play with my world like it's your little toy.
[00:33:54.185 --> 00:33:59.991]  You put a gun in my hand and you hide from that.
[00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:13.351]  Welcome back.
[00:34:14.011 --> 00:34:22.014]  Yeah, when you look at the Communist Chinese soldiers dragging men, women, children away, they have looks of demonic pleasure.
[00:34:22.054 --> 00:34:24.335]  They enjoy just the raw exercise of power.
[00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:27.696]  Dragging people off to have their organs harvested.
[00:34:27.756 --> 00:34:29.137]  Dragging the women off to rape them.
[00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:30.599]  They're the winners.
[00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:31.439]  They're the good guys.
[00:34:31.459 --> 00:34:32.340]  They always win.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.241]  They've got the big evil behind them.
[00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:36.282]  No, evil doesn't always win.
[00:34:36.302 --> 00:34:38.463]  And just like Hitler and all the rest of it, you're going to fall.
[00:34:39.604 --> 00:34:40.325]  Just like Mao.
[00:34:40.365 --> 00:34:41.025]  He fell.
[00:34:41.926 --> 00:34:42.646]  Ceausescu.
[00:34:44.007 --> 00:34:44.647]  Mussolini.
[00:34:48.049 --> 00:34:48.950]  You all fail.
[00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:49.950]  You all fall.
[00:34:52.232 --> 00:34:54.173]  Okay, here's the deal.
[00:34:54.693 --> 00:34:56.114]  This is the type of news I have.
[00:34:56.154 --> 00:34:57.255]  This is from Reuters.
[00:34:57.535 --> 00:34:58.736]  Okay, this is Reuters.
[00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:04.526]  New World Order buyers seen for banks.
[00:35:05.447 --> 00:35:08.450]  And it just says this means the beginning of the New World Order.
[00:35:09.211 --> 00:35:11.834]  See, they have to openly brag what they're doing to you.
[00:35:11.874 --> 00:35:15.378]  Before I get into the financial news, I want to just make it very clear.
[00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:19.302]  What's happening today is a political question.
[00:35:22.077 --> 00:35:24.659]  The central banks have designed this whole Ponzi scheme.
[00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:28.142]  They issued mountains of currency, credit, liquidity.
[00:35:28.182 --> 00:35:34.747]  They bought up all the real assets, the infrastructure, the commodities, the vast majority of it.
[00:35:35.968 --> 00:35:37.329]  They bought off your politicians.
[00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:38.410]  They had endless money to do it.
[00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:41.513]  They militarized your police with grants.
[00:35:41.553 --> 00:35:42.053]  They did it all.
[00:35:42.073 --> 00:35:44.095]  It's real simple.
[00:35:47.532 --> 00:35:53.915]  They brainwashed the public to go along with it, and now they're going to implode the entire economy while telling you it's good while they implode it.
[00:35:54.175 --> 00:35:56.876]  And the mind control is so great, many will say the economy is wonderful.
[00:35:57.736 --> 00:35:59.937]  People will say the dollar is strong, even when it's toilet paper.
[00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:01.798]  They're still doing it.
[00:36:02.458 --> 00:36:11.182]  But that's only meant so you get left holding all the bag, and the establishment gets to extricate themselves out of the implosion they designed as a consolidation.
[00:36:11.542 --> 00:36:14.823]  That will make the Great Depression, if it continues, look like a walk in the park.
[00:36:18.192 --> 00:36:19.472]  I wish this wasn't happening.
[00:36:20.572 --> 00:36:22.093]  I wish I wasn't right about gold.
[00:36:23.473 --> 00:36:25.113]  I wish I wasn't right about commodities.
[00:36:25.173 --> 00:36:26.574]  I wish I wasn't right about the New World Order.
[00:36:26.874 --> 00:36:29.634]  Because this means they're going to follow everything else they said they're going to do.
[00:36:30.134 --> 00:36:31.054]  This is just the beginning.
[00:36:31.314 --> 00:36:32.555]  This is the honeymoon, folks.
[00:36:32.895 --> 00:36:34.695]  This is the edge of the storm.
[00:36:34.955 --> 00:36:38.176]  This isn't even the foothills of the mountains we're going into.
[00:36:41.756 --> 00:36:43.937]  It's unbelievable.
[00:36:44.597 --> 00:36:45.537]  It is unspeakable.
[00:36:46.641 --> 00:36:56.027]  There are thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands times raw debt created out of nothing than there is actual assets in the entire planet.
[00:36:56.087 --> 00:36:57.028]  It's not even real.
[00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:58.789]  They created a black hole.
[00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:59.689]  Why do I say a black hole?
[00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:06.354]  It sucks all life, all energy, all light into it.
[00:37:06.894 --> 00:37:07.895]  And that's what they've created.
[00:37:09.275 --> 00:37:11.717]  And now they're going to wreck their own companies, they're going to consolidate.
[00:37:11.977 --> 00:37:14.619]  There are 100-year-old, there are 50-year-old, there are 85-year-old companies.
[00:37:17.981 --> 00:37:25.868]  Companies that were worth tens of trillions of dollars leveraged, who are being sold for $250-$260 million right now.
[00:37:26.168 --> 00:37:32.974]  And when JP Morgan buys Bear Stearns, that's a favor, because it's really just trillions of dollars of debt they've just bought.
[00:37:33.354 --> 00:37:34.315]  Absolute crap.
[00:37:34.735 --> 00:37:35.255]  Worthless.
[00:37:35.316 --> 00:37:36.096]  It's going nowhere.
[00:37:38.398 --> 00:37:39.799]  And it's the domino effect.
[00:37:41.641 --> 00:37:43.923]  Now, we've been telling you for three years
[00:37:46.599 --> 00:38:00.542]  And we've been hot and heavy telling you since 2006 when we had moles inside Bilderberg, and we can't, I mean, by the way, the moles are so good that we tell you Bush will next week announce that he's supporting global warming, global tax.
[00:38:00.902 --> 00:38:02.503]  People laughed at us, then it was announced.
[00:38:02.563 --> 00:38:04.263]  That was last year's Bilderberg.
[00:38:05.804 --> 00:38:07.044]  Hard to believe a new one's coming up.
[00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.004]  Man, time flies.
[00:38:10.005 --> 00:38:11.125]  And then a week later he announced
[00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:20.415]  Jim Tucker was able to say that they were going to stage the fall of the Berlin Wall a year before it happened when no one had ever heard of such a thing.
[00:38:21.275 --> 00:38:28.919]  He found out it was going to be a staged event and wrote about it on the front page of a newspaper with hundreds of thousands in circulation because they were going to stage that event.
[00:38:31.621 --> 00:38:32.841]  Hundreds of such predictions.
[00:38:33.161 --> 00:38:38.764]  Oh no, Tucker said, we're not going to invade in March of 2002, it'll be March of 2003.
[00:38:39.244 --> 00:38:42.226]  Now we're having the 5th year anniversary come up here in just a few days.
[00:38:47.538 --> 00:38:48.719]  And what did they say then?
[00:38:49.019 --> 00:39:00.427]  Estillon and Tucker, who respectively have been covering Bilderberg for 45 years, longer than that.
[00:39:00.447 --> 00:39:04.249]  33 for Tucker, 17 now for Estillon.
[00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:15.517]  They said they're going to implode the housing market first, to destroy the entire global derivatives market,
[00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:20.481]  And that there's going to be a world financial meltdown and they're going to consolidate.
[00:39:22.142 --> 00:39:28.025]  But we don't need to believe Daniel Estelin or Jim Tucker, even though they're right, even though they had sources inside.
[00:39:30.047 --> 00:39:42.394]  All we have to do is go to the IMF documents released in 2002 by Joseph Stiklitz, Nobel Prize winner, who left
[00:39:45.129 --> 00:40:02.918]  Where the IMF and World Bank have this 100 point plan they make you sign, it's a 112 point plan, and it even talks about how they orchestrate the final implosion, the rioting in the streets, then they get to bring in the troops, then they get to totally implode all stocks down to zero, they get everything.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:11.583]  And since 2002 I've been saying, I mean back then we were sitting on enough derivatives hundreds of times what we could ever pay back.
[00:40:15.006 --> 00:40:16.406]  The banks just created it out of nothing.
[00:40:17.067 --> 00:40:17.867]  But they get the world.
[00:40:18.447 --> 00:40:20.187]  So they're going to blow out hundreds of banks.
[00:40:20.207 --> 00:40:22.868]  You know, when the FDIC doubled its employees in the last year?
[00:40:22.888 --> 00:40:25.088]  And they just hired more again?
[00:40:26.989 --> 00:40:27.669]  More than doubling?
[00:40:28.809 --> 00:40:33.290]  FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, saying they're getting ready for hundreds and hundreds of banks to go under?
[00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.991]  And that's what's in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:40:35.031 --> 00:40:36.171]  That means thousands of banks.
[00:40:42.372 --> 00:40:45.254]  This is not for theatrical fun that we get up here and talk about this.
[00:40:45.534 --> 00:40:46.575]  We tell you straight.
[00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:50.537]  We give you the straight scoop here.
[00:40:50.837 --> 00:40:52.498]  We interview all the experts.
[00:40:52.538 --> 00:40:57.261]  We bring you the people on the inside, the people who've made predictions that have borne out time and time again.
[00:40:57.861 --> 00:41:05.306]  We bring you the head of the governmental system for the Tibetans in absentia.
[00:41:06.627 --> 00:41:07.987]  We bring you the top economist.
[00:41:08.028 --> 00:41:08.648]  We bring you
[00:41:09.732 --> 00:41:14.596]  Whoever the top people in their field, genetic engineering, we don't just make the claims we bring in here to you.
[00:41:14.937 --> 00:41:19.460]  And folks, we have done the total analysis, and it is all by design.
[00:41:19.741 --> 00:41:20.862]  That is the only issue.
[00:41:20.902 --> 00:41:23.003]  It's too late now to turn this around.
[00:41:23.324 --> 00:41:24.965]  It's too late now to fix this.
[00:41:28.148 --> 00:41:36.394]  All we can do is try to protect ourselves individually, and then politically, it's too late to stop it now, to stop it unraveling.
[00:41:36.755 --> 00:41:38.176]  But it is not too late
[00:41:41.218 --> 00:41:43.138]  To politically expose who's behind it.
[00:41:43.478 --> 00:41:50.280]  Because if we don't do that, and if we don't demonize the New World Order, and we don't show how they engineered this, they're going to pose as our saviors.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:57.661]  And their problem-reaction solution, they create the crisis and offer the next solution that brings you even deeper under their thrall.
[00:41:58.221 --> 00:41:58.922]  Under their control.
[00:41:59.882 --> 00:42:10.384]  So, if we don't fully discredit them and expose how they engineered this on purpose, they're going to get away with literally taking over all the wealth in the world that they didn't control, which is only about 20%.
[00:42:14.835 --> 00:42:15.055]  I think so.
[00:42:37.631 --> 00:42:49.178]  I mean, right now they're merging, they're slashing, they're buying thousands of major companies, airline, airline manufacturers, defense contractors, major banks, hundreds of them a day are being consolidated.
[00:42:51.599 --> 00:42:54.121]  This is a consolidation of the big boys.
[00:42:57.883 --> 00:43:02.426]  And their implosions, thousands of companies going under.
[00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:10.217]  Real estate, condos, Las Vegas hotels going under, just everything going under.
[00:43:10.958 --> 00:43:13.400]  GM, Ford teetering on the edge of the precipice.
[00:43:17.604 --> 00:43:24.249]  As they fall, as they crush, as they implode, they crush whoever works for them, whoever gets pensions from them.
[00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.453]  The inflation will destroy people on fixed income, Social Security.
[00:43:28.714 --> 00:43:29.794]  It already has hurt you badly.
[00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:30.535]  It hasn't even begun.
[00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.673]  And I talk to people and they have a pre-programmed response.
[00:43:37.713 --> 00:43:38.894]  They say, well, I don't own any stocks.
[00:43:38.934 --> 00:43:40.356]  Why do I care if the market goes down?
[00:43:40.376 --> 00:43:41.757]  And I go, it's not about the market.
[00:43:41.797 --> 00:43:44.120]  It's all those companies that you work for.
[00:43:45.009 --> 00:43:46.070]  They do trade on the market.
[00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:51.193]  Or even if you don't work for any of those Fortune 500 companies, they do business with your company or where you work.
[00:43:51.513 --> 00:43:52.694]  This will affect you.
[00:43:52.874 --> 00:43:58.017]  But Americans are pre-programmed to always claim, it doesn't affect me, I don't care, it's hurting somebody else.
[00:43:58.278 --> 00:44:01.219]  Listen, you dumbasses, excuse me for using that, I apologize.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.501]  I try to be, I'm just really freaked out here.
[00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:11.146]  Don't you understand, you fool, that something that happens in Communist China affects you, and something that happens here in the U.S.
[00:44:11.186 --> 00:44:12.787]  or to your neighbor really affects you?
[00:44:13.982 --> 00:44:17.284]  The New World Order sold you on only caring about yourselves.
[00:44:19.205 --> 00:44:24.668]  And automatically, it's like a mental illness, whenever you're faced with some crisis, you just rationalize it away.
[00:44:24.948 --> 00:44:27.109]  That doesn't get the problem fixed!
[00:44:29.851 --> 00:44:32.492]  Do you know what a depression will look like in this country?
[00:44:34.374 --> 00:44:40.297]  Do you know people starved to death in the 1930's when 80% of us could grow food and lived on farms?
[00:44:40.917 --> 00:44:42.118]  It's the opposite of that now.
[00:44:44.336 --> 00:44:46.678]  95% aren't self-sustaining.
[00:44:47.999 --> 00:44:50.922]  10% live in the country, but only 5% are self-sustaining.
[00:44:51.763 --> 00:44:52.843]  Do you understand?
[00:44:53.164 --> 00:44:53.984]  Do you read me?
[00:44:54.165 --> 00:44:56.226]  They're going to come and take your farms and ranches.
[00:44:56.407 --> 00:44:57.948]  They're going to repossess everything!
[00:44:58.738 --> 00:45:02.963]  Even if you've got money to pay your taxes, they're going to send goons out to steal your property.
[00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:03.824]  Because you know what?
[00:45:03.884 --> 00:45:08.570]  They know by imploding the economy, they're going to be able to hire a bunch of goons that'll do anything for money.
[00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.234]  This is all being precipitated by design.
[00:45:12.274 --> 00:45:14.757]  This is a black cauldron of hell!
[00:45:15.178 --> 00:45:18.822]  This is judgment on this country being released!
[00:45:32.671 --> 00:45:40.273]  I guess there's some micron chance that we might just have a deep recession, but... I'm hoping for that, okay?
[00:45:40.293 --> 00:45:43.114]  But it's almost bad of me to come on here and even try to make you hope.
[00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:46.095]  Because then you might sit around... I sit around!
[00:45:46.135 --> 00:45:52.417]  I'm so busy doing radio shows and doing research and setting up guests and working, making films, that I can't even get my own finances in order.
[00:45:57.418 --> 00:45:59.139]  Let me read you the financial news here.
[00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:00.319]  New World Order.
[00:46:00.399 --> 00:46:02.200]  Buyers seen for banks.
[00:46:03.763 --> 00:46:11.173]  Financial firms face a new world order after weekend fire sale of Bear Stearns in the Federal Reserve's first emergency weekend meeting since 1979.
[00:46:11.233 --> 00:46:13.856]  Research firm Credit Cite said in a report.
[00:46:13.897 --> 00:46:17.081]  Then it goes on to talk about new world order and how it's taking over.
[00:46:17.814 --> 00:46:18.795]  Yeah, but it doesn't exist.
[00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:21.397]  This delusional bull has to stop.
[00:46:21.978 --> 00:46:25.380]  Dollar's nosedive stirs joint intervention jitters.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.661]  The dollar sharp slide.
[00:46:27.142 --> 00:46:38.551]  The 13-year lows against the yen and fresh all-time lows versus the euro on Monday is stoking jitters at the possibility of a joint central bank intervention to prop up the dollar, which means more inflation
[00:46:39.131 --> 00:46:40.753]  Which will drive down the dollar even more.
[00:46:40.953 --> 00:46:42.154]  And they cut interest rates again.
[00:46:42.355 --> 00:46:43.356]  That drives it down again.
[00:46:43.616 --> 00:46:50.123]  They're doing all this on purpose, knowing the public's too dumb to know that their quote, interventions are the opposite of that.
[00:46:53.026 --> 00:46:54.448]  Well, Bush says he's trying to help.
[00:46:54.508 --> 00:46:55.509]  He's doing the opposite.
[00:46:55.529 --> 00:46:56.490]  He doesn't run anything.
[00:46:58.539 --> 00:47:00.761]  Greenspan's running around and bad-mouthing.
[00:47:00.801 --> 00:47:01.602]  Here he is again today.
[00:47:01.862 --> 00:47:04.744]  Greenspan, economy worse since World War II.
[00:47:04.804 --> 00:47:06.846]  And he goes on to say, since the end of the Great Depression.
[00:47:07.246 --> 00:47:09.488]  Again, trying to make things as bad as he can.
[00:47:10.128 --> 00:47:12.250]  See, I'm here saying it's bad because they're doing it.
[00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:13.891]  But they're the ones that get listened to.
[00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:16.854]  They're doing it to artificially drive it down so they get it all.
[00:47:18.875 --> 00:47:21.357]  Dollar tumbles after Fed's weekend action.
[00:47:22.318 --> 00:47:23.179]  The dollar tumbled.
[00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:26.702]  And it just goes into
[00:47:27.597 --> 00:47:28.337]  What's happening there?
[00:47:28.377 --> 00:47:28.818]  Here's another one.
[00:47:28.858 --> 00:47:31.819]  Carlisle Capital bankrupt to wind up fund.
[00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:46.844]  And they're just shutting down and their investors and people that held stock in it are now going to be given... Their stock was $20 a share.
[00:47:46.904 --> 00:47:47.745]  Now it's $2.
[00:47:48.305 --> 00:47:51.466]  And they're saying that may not even be able to be sustained.
[00:47:51.506 --> 00:47:52.507]  So they're just shutting it down.
[00:47:52.567 --> 00:47:52.867]  Bye.
[00:47:52.987 --> 00:47:53.207]  Boom.
[00:47:54.252 --> 00:47:57.573]  Trillions of dollars leveraged, already put into real assets, see?
[00:47:57.933 --> 00:48:02.094]  And then now they just close it down and burn the people that gave them the seed money to go leverage.
[00:48:04.154 --> 00:48:04.735]  I shouldn't laugh.
[00:48:04.775 --> 00:48:05.935]  It's just so sick, man.
[00:48:06.915 --> 00:48:07.735]  It's so sick.
[00:48:09.696 --> 00:48:12.797]  Lehman shares hit as domino speculation grows.
[00:48:13.197 --> 00:48:22.359]  Lehman Brothers share dropped more than 25% in pre-market trading as Wall Street wondered whether the firm might be the next domino to fall in the banking meltdown.
[00:48:24.269 --> 00:48:25.649]  They've lost their A1 rating.
[00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:26.370]  J.P.
[00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.830]  Morgan agrees to buy Bear Stearns for $2 a share.
[00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:40.013]  And agreed to finance $30 billion in assets that aren't assets.
[00:48:40.553 --> 00:48:43.154]  It's a Ponzi scheme coming unraveled.
[00:48:48.118 --> 00:49:01.730]  JP Morgan Chase set a deal to buy stricken rival Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom price while the US Federal Reserve expanded lending to securities firms for the first time since the Great Depression to prop up the financial system.
[00:49:02.851 --> 00:49:09.837]  The shock news, the biggest sign yet of how devastating the credit crisis is for Wall Street slammed the US dollar to a record low.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.101]  Gold hits $130 an ounce
[00:49:18.112 --> 00:49:39.365]  The gold price surged well past the landmark it reached last week to $1,380, $1,030.80, announced because of fears around the stability of the global financial sector after JP Morgan bought Bear Stearns at a fire sale price for the Federal Reserve expanded lending to the financial services.
[00:49:40.766 --> 00:49:43.808]  The news driving investors into bullying shows no sign of letting up.
[00:49:46.497 --> 00:49:54.461]  As many in the market are calling gold higher at $1,250 or $1,500 not long from now.
[00:49:54.621 --> 00:49:55.721]  Let's bring up Ted Anderson.
[00:49:55.741 --> 00:49:57.542]  We only have about four minutes on the other side.
[00:49:58.283 --> 00:49:59.845]  Ted's been in this business 28 years.
[00:49:59.925 --> 00:50:01.567]  Ted, what's the market news you've got?
[00:50:01.587 --> 00:50:03.128]  The markets globally are down right now.
[00:50:03.388 --> 00:50:08.274]  Well, I'm picking through the same news that you are, but you take a look at that buyout by Bear Stearns.
[00:50:08.334 --> 00:50:13.259]  I mean, that's the Federal Reserve System stepping in and going, OK, we do have a depression coming on here.
[00:50:13.299 --> 00:50:14.180]  It's very similar to 1929.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:20.687]  Not only are we going to make credit easier, now we're just going to step in and start investing in these companies.
[00:50:21.167 --> 00:50:28.531]  I mean, my God, Alex, this means that the United States dollar is just going to be falling like a storm because... But maybe people don't understand that.
[00:50:28.811 --> 00:50:32.413]  And we know we have a smart audience, but some people who are new literally don't understand anything.
[00:50:33.454 --> 00:50:35.134]  So when we come back, we'll explain that, Ted.
[00:50:35.495 --> 00:50:38.796]  Yeah, I'll be happy to go into it, because this is very serious information.
[00:50:38.836 --> 00:50:39.737]  You've got to hear it, man.
[00:50:40.777 --> 00:50:43.039]  Yeah, I mean, let me just add a little caveat now.
[00:50:44.239 --> 00:50:49.322]  Folks, you have to pay this back in tax money, but also it devalues your currency.
[00:50:50.072 --> 00:50:50.819]  You understand that?
[00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:52.233]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.503 --> 00:51:04.045]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:51:04.385 --> 00:51:05.666]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[00:51:05.926 --> 00:51:07.907]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:51:08.087 --> 00:51:09.828]  The Truth Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:09.988 --> 00:51:11.229]  The Late Great USA.
[00:51:11.469 --> 00:51:12.890]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[00:51:28.139 --> 00:51:28.439]  I think so.
[00:52:01.682 --> 00:52:03.443]  Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention.
[00:52:03.663 --> 00:52:04.944]  Ron Paul did not quit.
[00:52:05.144 --> 00:52:06.145]  He is still in the race.
[00:52:06.525 --> 00:52:09.807]  Most Americans do not understand how the election process works.
[00:52:10.248 --> 00:52:11.288]  The media is lying.
[00:52:11.749 --> 00:52:14.310]  John McCain does not have the Republican nomination.
[00:52:14.711 --> 00:52:17.432]  The popular vote is just a straw poll, believe it or not.
[00:52:17.813 --> 00:52:20.995]  The delegates have the power over the elections, not the voters.
[00:52:21.415 --> 00:52:25.798]  After the mainstream media wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit, many supporters quit as well.
[00:52:26.359 --> 00:52:31.262]  Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency, as long as he has your continued support.
[00:52:31.722 --> 00:52:32.743]  Ron Paul has a plan.
[00:52:33.023 --> 00:52:39.307]  The delegates have not yet been voted on, and they are voted first in county, then state, all the way to the National Convention.
[00:52:39.788 --> 00:52:44.231]  Go to our website at ronpaulflags.com and click on why Ron Paul will win.

[00:52:48.655 --> 00:52:49.395]  Stand your ground.

[00:53:18.818 --> 00:53:19.538]  We're good to go.
[00:53:37.827 --> 00:53:38.227]  Let's do it!
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.481]  Look, the simplest way to describe this is this.
[00:54:13.681 --> 00:54:19.142]  Mexico, in the 80s, devalued their currency down to basically nothing and robbed the general public.
[00:54:19.582 --> 00:54:25.284]  But the people running the country, while they were jacking up the currency, bought real assets with it globally.
[00:54:25.904 --> 00:54:29.305]  And that's why Mexico, per capita, has the most billionaires of any nation in the world.
[00:54:29.325 --> 00:54:31.706]  In fact, the richest guy in the U.S.
[00:54:31.786 --> 00:54:35.567]  is no longer Bill Gates, because the guy's also a U.S.
[00:54:35.607 --> 00:54:36.007]  citizen.
[00:54:36.267 --> 00:54:37.067]  It's a Mexican.
[00:54:38.639 --> 00:54:40.300]  So, uh, that's how that works.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.641]  And so they have destroyed your entire future.
[00:54:42.981 --> 00:54:44.341]  They have totally raped and robbed you.
[00:54:44.921 --> 00:54:48.903]  The question is, will we let the mainstream media now get away with this and cover this up?
[00:54:49.323 --> 00:54:50.464]  And will you protect yourselves?
[00:54:50.784 --> 00:54:51.404]  Uh, Ted, go ahead.
[00:54:52.139 --> 00:54:57.244]  Just about to say with the Federal Reserve System stepping in and helping buy out this Bear Stearns deal.
[00:54:57.304 --> 00:54:59.767]  It's the first time that's happened since the Great Depression.
[00:55:00.768 --> 00:55:06.714]  That particular stock was trading and went from $160 down to $60 and now they're buying at $2 per share.
[00:55:07.174 --> 00:55:09.336]  I should reprint that Oh Yeah book.
[00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:11.158]  I know I sent you one a while ago Alex.
[00:55:11.218 --> 00:55:11.879]  It talks about
[00:55:12.479 --> 00:55:17.382]  What the stock market was like in 1929 going into the depression of the 1930s.
[00:55:17.422 --> 00:55:22.845]  And all the predominant individuals at that time were trying to convince people that this is all going to come back.
[00:55:23.145 --> 00:55:24.146]  It's all going to recover.
[00:55:24.206 --> 00:55:25.227]  Everything's going to be great.
[00:55:25.267 --> 00:55:26.227]  Don't worry about this.
[00:55:26.607 --> 00:55:29.249]  And you hear the same rhetoric going on in the papers today.
[00:55:29.689 --> 00:55:37.994]  Right now the Federal Reserve System is printing money like drunken sailors and they're injecting it into the system and now they're trying to prop up the stock market to avoid
[00:55:38.494 --> 00:55:39.975]  And Ted, let me be clear on this.
[00:56:06.353 --> 00:56:07.875]  Both the bad things are happening.
[00:56:08.035 --> 00:56:20.710]  They tell the public, oh, we're hoping to inject hundreds of billions of dollars a month into these companies, into these big brokerage houses, to keep the market going.
[00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:32.878]  But those are dominoing and going down, even though they're injecting the hundreds of billions a month, and it's devaluing the dollar while they do it, and then people would think, oh, they're just stupid.
[00:56:32.918 --> 00:56:33.898]  No, they're not stupid.
[00:56:33.938 --> 00:56:35.920]  We have their own documents.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.502]  This is by design.
[00:56:38.542 --> 00:56:43.645]  It'll show you rich guys jumping out a window soon, and they'll show you some guys worth a billion bucks going to jail.
[00:56:43.985 --> 00:56:44.746]  They're nothing.
[00:56:45.106 --> 00:56:48.269]  The real power is worth hundreds and hundreds of trillions apiece.
[00:56:48.689 --> 00:56:52.392]  They are controlling all this, and they are doing this by design, Ted.
[00:56:52.412 --> 00:56:54.614]  Well, this is where you're hitting the nail right on the head, Alex.
[00:56:54.654 --> 00:56:59.698]  The people that are printing the money are able to buy real property by just printing something for nothing.
[00:56:59.718 --> 00:57:09.586]  They're ending up with all the value of this country, and we, the citizens, the people of the United States of America, who are forced by our legal tender laws to accept their money, are the ones that are losing.
[00:57:09.806 --> 00:57:10.427]  It's crazy.
[00:57:10.487 --> 00:57:11.808]  We should be up in arms.
[00:57:11.848 --> 00:57:13.890]  We should start a revolution because of the fact
[00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.292]  That we can't have constitutional money here.
[00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:23.598]  It's crazy that we accept what we're accepting, but then nonetheless... This is multi-pronged, though, and I want to hold you over one more segment.
[00:57:23.618 --> 00:57:28.362]  The Daniel Sundiata is coming on, the big star of Rescue Me.
[00:57:28.783 --> 00:57:31.205]  He's really upset about the demonization of 9-11 Truth.
[00:57:31.825 --> 00:57:34.248]  We'll be breaking that down for you.
[00:57:34.468 --> 00:57:36.770]  He called in to the Sunday show, and I wanted to have him back on.
[00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:40.072]  We've got a lady who's basically having her parents euthanized.
[00:57:40.733 --> 00:57:43.175]  We'll do financial news in the third hour.
[00:57:43.475 --> 00:57:45.917]  We've got Bob Chapman joining us as well.
[00:57:46.177 --> 00:57:48.819]  And more attacks on 9-11 Truth.
[00:57:49.059 --> 00:57:53.343]  We're going to have, for about 10 minutes, right at the end of the show, Luke Rodowski on.
[00:57:53.663 --> 00:57:55.905]  They've had somebody show up with a sign saying,
[00:57:56.625 --> 00:58:15.115]  9-11 Truth carried out the Times Square bombing and it's a known disinfo operative one of the no-plainers and so clearly the enemy's coming out of the closet openly declaring themselves agents then this guy assaulted somebody so it is it is really heating up out there ladies and gentlemen Ted stay there I want to talk about a how do we
[00:58:15.915 --> 00:58:17.175]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.184 --> 00:58:48.565]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.088 --> 00:58:58.768]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.388 --> 00:59:00.509]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.169 --> 00:59:02.289]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.909 --> 00:59:03.770]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:06.010]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:09.691]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.252 --> 00:59:14.353]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:20.243 --> 00:59:22.625]  Alright, we're facing economic meltdown.
[00:59:22.645 --> 00:59:24.526]  The domino effect has been triggered.
[00:59:25.127 --> 00:59:26.027]  It's irreversible.
[00:59:26.047 --> 00:59:30.350]  9-11 Truth is being demonized.
[00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:34.313]  The mainstream media has got CIA talking points saying we're all violent.
[00:59:34.493 --> 00:59:35.674]  No evidence of that made up.
[00:59:37.355 --> 00:59:43.439]  The star of Rescue Me and many other TV and movie programs, Daniel Sanjada, is going to be popping in for about 25 minutes.
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:45.861]  Coming up in more financial news today.
[00:59:47.422 --> 00:59:55.050]  Going back to Ted, Ted Anderson, is there a way to basically and simply explain this to people that there's no way to get out of this financial bubble they've created?
[00:59:56.231 --> 00:59:57.832]  Alex, it's as simple as this.
[00:59:58.512 --> 01:00:01.053]  The money comes into the system through a bank.
[01:00:01.113 --> 01:00:02.174]  They lend it to us.
[01:00:02.234 --> 01:00:04.235]  We have to pay interest on that debt.
[01:00:04.755 --> 01:00:06.456]  And that compounds against us.
[01:00:06.516 --> 01:00:09.677]  Every time we take on more money, we have to pay more interest.
[01:00:09.957 --> 01:00:16.600]  Mathematically, for those of you who can do the numbers, you'll know that you have a compounding system that's working against you.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.961]  Eventually, it consumes you.
[01:00:18.361 --> 01:00:20.002]  It's just like if you're paying credit cards
[01:00:20.722 --> 01:00:21.982]  One credit card with the next.
[01:00:22.022 --> 01:00:25.463]  You can do it for a while, but then after a while the interest gets to be too much.
[01:00:25.483 --> 01:00:26.404]  You can't do it no more.
[01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:40.148]  The United States government had, I should say, the United States Congress turned over the power to create money to the Federal Reserve Bank in 1913 and started this thing off and we're just at the end of the line on it.
[01:00:41.408 --> 01:00:48.460]  And the big right thing was in 13, once they got in control in 29 through 40, and then they did it in the 70s and 80s.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:52.347]  Now the big one, the mother of all meltdowns, is what we're now facing.
[01:00:52.387 --> 01:00:53.609]  Ted, we only got three minutes left.
[01:00:54.289 --> 01:00:56.370]  We know politically we've got exposures behind it.
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:57.030]  I'm going to do that.
[01:00:57.050 --> 01:00:57.951]  The Lizards are going to do that.
[01:00:57.991 --> 01:01:05.615]  My book that I wrote six years ago, Descent into Tyranny, has a whole chapter on it and said this is what happened with their own IMF documents, World Bank documents as well.
[01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:11.138]  In the two, three minutes we've got, you still have gold at last week's prices, but it's going to move up.
[01:01:12.038 --> 01:01:13.639]  It moved up last week from the week before.
[01:01:13.679 --> 01:01:14.579]  It's going to move up again.
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:17.521]  I'm locking in a little bit of gold and silver, what I can afford.
[01:01:18.161 --> 01:01:20.323]  People are insane if they don't call you.
[01:01:20.363 --> 01:01:21.164]  Tell them about the offer.
[01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:21.725]  Yeah, sure.
[01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:22.465]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:01:22.505 --> 01:01:24.027]  I've got the British Sovereign right now.
[01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:26.869]  They're at $277 per coin.
[01:01:26.909 --> 01:01:28.170]  We have the Frank coins.
[01:01:28.231 --> 01:01:29.251]  They're at $220.
[01:01:30.252 --> 01:01:34.356]  Sleeper for sure is silver right now because silver is going to take a big move too.
[01:01:34.837 --> 01:01:37.719]  And I've got those Walking Liberties still at $210.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.643]  Alex, I'm not kidding you when I say this.
[01:01:42.023 --> 01:01:44.044]  Supply is really the issue now.
[01:01:44.084 --> 01:01:47.086]  I've got people placing very large orders with us.
[01:01:47.106 --> 01:01:49.088]  We're running like crazy to fill those orders.
[01:01:49.888 --> 01:01:51.629]  Supply is going to be a big problem.
[01:01:51.669 --> 01:01:54.651]  You may want this kind of material two weeks from now.
[01:01:54.671 --> 01:01:56.973]  You might find that you have to settle for something different.
[01:01:57.713 --> 01:02:03.477]  You want to beat the yuppies, because the yuppies, by the time you hear them talking about it at the golf club,
[01:02:04.117 --> 01:02:06.399]  You know, about how they heard the new great deal is gold.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.300]  It's over.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.822]  There's only... You've got to get into this now.
[01:02:09.902 --> 01:02:10.903]  It's finite supply.
[01:02:10.943 --> 01:02:11.764]  Tell them about the offer.
[01:02:11.784 --> 01:02:12.485]  Give them the number, Ted.
[01:02:12.525 --> 01:02:15.587]  Yeah, the offers are for British sovereigns at $277.
[01:02:16.048 --> 01:02:19.711]  The franc coins are currently right now at $220.
[01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:22.693]  We also have the halves at $210.
[01:02:23.034 --> 01:02:24.815]  The telephone number to get a hold of us is 1-800-686.
[01:02:27.357 --> 01:02:49.308]  2-2-3-7 again 1-800-686-2237 you're entering into a market where normally normally there's only about one and a half percent of the population buying into this market right now and then the numbers are growing it's grown ten twenty percent it is just not enough of it to go around so you gotta get in now and you by now you should be able to see that the dollar is being cooked
[01:02:49.928 --> 01:02:56.832]  And you can't fix an ailing monetary system that's got problems from being watered down by adding more water.
[01:02:56.872 --> 01:03:00.534]  This Bear Stearns thing is like throwing buckets of water.
[01:03:00.554 --> 01:03:02.455]  And again, let's be clear.
[01:03:02.555 --> 01:03:03.195]  Let's be clear.
[01:03:03.695 --> 01:03:04.476]  You waited when it was $260.
[01:03:04.536 --> 01:03:05.256]  You waited when it was $400, $500, $600, $800, $1000.
[01:03:05.396 --> 01:03:06.437]  You keep thinking it's too much.
[01:03:06.477 --> 01:03:07.377]  Folks, the dollar is burning away.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.863]  And it'll take another year for its true inflationary effects to come home.
[01:03:16.163 --> 01:03:17.264]  Then it's really curtains.
[01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.246]  You gotta move into gold and silver.
[01:03:19.886 --> 01:03:21.067]  I recommend you move into both.
[01:03:21.087 --> 01:03:21.308]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:03:21.328 --> 01:03:21.408]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:22.629]  I hate the New World Order.
[01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:24.330]  I hate them with a passion.
[01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:25.671]  Don't get left holding the bag.
[01:03:25.712 --> 01:03:25.952]  Beat them.
[01:03:25.972 --> 01:03:27.073]  Get into metals now.
[01:03:27.093 --> 01:03:27.133]  800-686-2237.
[01:03:36.941 --> 01:03:38.962]  2237.
[01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:38.962]  Ted, thanks for coming in.
[01:03:39.002 --> 01:03:40.422]  And hey, that's the solution right there.
[01:03:40.803 --> 01:03:41.843]  Just protect ourselves.
[01:03:41.883 --> 01:03:42.863]  You can't save the ship.
[01:03:43.424 --> 01:03:46.765]  We can obviously throw overboard the people that actually did this.
[01:03:47.525 --> 01:03:48.585]  But Ted, thanks for coming on.
[01:03:48.645 --> 01:03:49.886]  Hey, it's always a pleasure Alex.

[01:04:53.727 --> 01:05:06.453]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:05:06.854 --> 01:05:17.519]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for the new independent investigation, in which family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:05:17.919 --> 01:05:21.080]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.041]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:28.822]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:05:54.093 --> 01:05:58.115]  The national savings rate has plummeted to an all-time low, while household debt is at an all-time high.
[01:05:58.255 --> 01:06:00.275]  The answer is not the creation of more debt.
[01:06:00.475 --> 01:06:13.820]  Using the innovative Interest-Canceling Money Merge Account program, along with existing banking tools, we offer you the power to pay off your mortgage in a fraction of the time and potentially save thousands in interest, all without refinancing an existing mortgage or interrupting your lifestyle.

[01:06:19.102 --> 01:06:24.604]  It is estimated that in just 18 months, our team alone has helped American homeowners get on track to save a half a billion dollars in interest.
[01:06:24.745 --> 01:06:25.805]  Agents are standing by.

[01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:02.405]  Government Cover-Ups.
[01:07:03.045 --> 01:07:03.866]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.606 --> 01:07:05.627]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:10.130]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:14.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:26.241]  This particular recruiting center has been the scene of demonstrations for decades.
[01:07:26.361 --> 01:07:39.405]  I remember during my day in the Vietnam era, that same, you know, it's right in the middle of Times Square, it's perfectly located, so it is where, you know, it's like a magnet for these crazy people, for anarchists.
[01:07:40.426 --> 01:07:41.847]  That's what I think this is.
[01:07:42.168 --> 01:07:45.770]  I think that this bomber isn't Al-Qaeda, isn't anything like that.
[01:07:46.071 --> 01:07:52.195]  He's more like, it's a man, he's more like those 9-11 was an inside job kind of guys.
[01:07:52.495 --> 01:08:00.141]  The protesting in a violent way, but in a violent way almost like the eco-terrorists, but they don't intend to inflict casualties.
[01:08:00.181 --> 01:08:01.102]  But they do it in the middle of the night.
[01:08:01.122 --> 01:08:02.843]  In the middle of the night, making a political point.
[01:08:02.863 --> 01:08:04.264]  They could have killed people with it, it had to be.
[01:08:04.304 --> 01:08:09.168]  Alright, and again, for six months, Glenn Beck, O'Reilly, Sean Hannity,
[01:08:11.131 --> 01:08:19.415]  Morning Joe, they've all been saying in unison, 9-11 truth is going to bomb, they're going to shoot, they're going to kill, use the military against us.
[01:08:19.435 --> 01:08:20.115]  With no evidence.
[01:08:20.516 --> 01:08:21.676]  It was a talking point though.
[01:08:22.376 --> 01:08:30.500]  Then, Geraldo comes out, and now others, and say, oh, we're probably behind the attack, we're violent, when we've never been violent.
[01:08:32.141 --> 01:08:35.102]  See, he lies, but he knows his audience is a bunch of idiots.
[01:08:36.155 --> 01:08:37.997]  And so this is the type of wickedness.
[01:08:38.017 --> 01:08:43.062]  And then we had this other newscast last week where the guys across the street with a sign saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[01:08:44.263 --> 01:08:46.005]  The Clinton supporters come over and beat him up.
[01:08:46.045 --> 01:08:47.246]  That's in the local newspaper.
[01:08:47.947 --> 01:08:53.432]  And by the time it gets on the morning show, they say, oh, he got in the president's face and the Secret Service arrested him.
[01:08:53.933 --> 01:08:54.954]  But that's not what happened.
[01:08:54.974 --> 01:08:56.035]  The Secret Service didn't touch him.
[01:08:56.415 --> 01:08:59.078]  And the local paper said he shouldn't have been arrested, but they arrested him.
[01:09:00.467 --> 01:09:04.716]  You see, this is the... They're scared of 9-11 Truth, folks, because this is their baby.
[01:09:04.776 --> 01:09:05.698]  They carried this out.
[01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:07.221]  The establishment carried it out.
[01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:18.579]  And Daniel Sinjada, of course, a big star of Rescue Me, a very popular television program, and he's one of the big stars on that show, and a lot of other popular TV programs and movies, you name it.
[01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:24.781]  He is a Tony-nominated television actor, and we appreciate him coming on.
[01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:29.602]  Yesterday, he said he was there at his place shooting a romantic comedy in Boston.
[01:09:29.622 --> 01:09:30.422]  He normally lives in New York.
[01:09:31.102 --> 01:09:38.884]  And, uh, he was listening to the show and he got so mad he called, and he says he's called Fox, because he realizes, I'm glad he realizes, how serious this is.
[01:09:39.224 --> 01:09:41.085]  Daniel Senjata, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:09:41.705 --> 01:09:45.066]  Oh, thanks for having me on again, Alex, and thank you for indulging me yesterday.
[01:09:45.086 --> 01:10:00.050]  I really just, literally, was just chomping at the bit, myself starting to froth at the mouth, but just more with righteous indignation at, uh, at just the unbelievable, uh, hypocrisy of, uh, of Fox.
[01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.831]  We're good.
[01:10:13.972 --> 01:10:14.793]  We are not cowards.
[01:10:14.913 --> 01:10:18.637]  They are the cowards because they refuse to engage us on the facts.
[01:10:18.977 --> 01:10:21.880]  What they want to do is they want to do these ad hominem attacks.
[01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:26.064]  They want to, you know, try to, you know, make people look like they're insane.
[01:10:26.085 --> 01:10:27.786]  They want to make people look like they're crazy.
[01:10:27.826 --> 01:10:31.350]  They'll attack the Charlie Sheens and the Rosie O'Donnells and the Marion Cotillards.
[01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.211]  Meanwhile, they won't address you.
[01:10:33.611 --> 01:10:39.133]  They won't bring you on TV to have a rational and reasoned discussion and debate based on the facts.
[01:10:39.493 --> 01:10:48.437]  So the only cowards in the situation are people like Geraldo and the other people that are using these probably CIA-given talking points to try to demonize 9-11 truth.
[01:10:48.717 --> 01:10:49.337]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:49.657 --> 01:10:54.219]  Well, I agree with you, and yesterday you were really hot in the time we had.
[01:10:54.259 --> 01:11:03.222]  I mean, seeing that video, knowing Geraldo's doing this, I mean, I understand how serious it is, but I want to get your take on it and what you think we should do about it.
[01:11:04.273 --> 01:11:08.737]  Well, you know, I mean, it is very serious and what to do about it.
[01:11:08.817 --> 01:11:10.758]  I mean, people just have got to do that.
[01:11:10.778 --> 01:11:12.480]  They have got to follow your advice.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:19.906]  You know, Alex, you tell people to get on to the information sharing networks, to download your movies, to talk to their friends.
[01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:22.878]  I mean, we can lead horses to water, but we can't make them drink.
[01:11:23.199 --> 01:11:27.463]  However, I think that there's enough information out there, especially about 9-11.
[01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:34.049]  And I think the reason why it's important to focus on that is that it's, you know, that is the one spot out of all the things that you talk about.
[01:11:34.349 --> 01:11:42.497]  I think that 9-11 is the one thing that if we can focus on that and push that forward into the mainstream, it's the proverbial soft spot on the underbelly of the dragon.
[01:11:42.777 --> 01:11:44.839]  They really left themselves overextended there.
[01:11:44.879 --> 01:11:46.060]  They really messed up there.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:51.243]  I think that their hubris got the better of them, and they thought that they were going to be able to, you know, sneak one past us.
[01:11:51.604 --> 01:11:52.644]  But we know who did it.
[01:11:53.065 --> 01:11:54.346]  We know who's responsible.
[01:11:54.866 --> 01:12:05.293]  And when it goes mainstream, and when America wakes up to the truth of what happened that day, and all the lies that have been told in the wake of that horrific event, there's going to be hell to pay.
[01:12:05.593 --> 01:12:06.494]  There's going to be hell to pay.
[01:12:06.534 --> 01:12:08.475]  Now, nobody's saying that we want violence.
[01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:10.317]  Nobody's doing anything violent.
[01:12:10.337 --> 01:12:12.078]  We're certainly not bombing Times Square.
[01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:13.608]  Or anything like that.
[01:12:13.648 --> 01:12:14.589]  That's just absolutely standard.
[01:12:14.609 --> 01:12:16.029]  Well, that's why they're scared, though.
[01:12:16.069 --> 01:12:17.209]  They know where this leads.
[01:12:17.269 --> 01:12:18.590]  It does lead to them indicted.
[01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.471]  It does lead to them spending the rest of their lives in prison.
[01:12:21.951 --> 01:12:29.633]  And so that's why there's... I mean, the fear you see in the politicians now, the fear you see in these pundits, it's because they know it's an inside job.
[01:12:30.093 --> 01:12:31.973]  Folks, look at how guilty they act.
[01:12:32.034 --> 01:12:33.394]  Look at how upset they are.
[01:12:33.734 --> 01:12:35.855]  They know, and they know this isn't stopping.
[01:12:37.646 --> 01:12:38.287]  Absolutely true.
[01:12:38.888 --> 01:12:44.976]  I mean, you know, one of our favorite guests that you've had on recently, and I've made an effort to reach out and contact her, is Naomi Wolf.
[01:12:45.726 --> 01:12:55.611]  Uh, you know, after I heard her on your show, I read her article, uh, Fascist America and Ten Easy Steps, and recently I bought her book, uh, The End of America, Letter to a Young Patriot.
[01:12:56.012 --> 01:12:58.733]  I mean, folks, uh, this is classic.
[01:12:58.773 --> 01:13:07.498]  What Heraldo did the other day is a classic hallmarker for, you know, a precursor to, you know, more aggressive action.
[01:13:07.798 --> 01:13:15.022]  You know, what they're trying to do is they're trying to demonize groups who are actually taking peaceful means to keep their freedom, uh, and what, and
[01:13:15.822 --> 01:13:19.024]  What follows after that is the actual roundups, the actual detentions.
[01:13:19.044 --> 01:13:29.390]  This is, we are in a crisis state of emergency, and if all we do is tune in and listen, and go back to our normal everyday lives, pretty soon we're going to find ourselves, it's going to be too late.
[01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:30.431]  It's going to be too late.
[01:13:30.931 --> 01:13:32.111]  And we're at that point now.
[01:13:32.172 --> 01:13:33.732]  People have got to get active.
[01:13:34.132 --> 01:13:34.832]  Got to get active.
[01:13:34.852 --> 01:13:42.975]  We have to start taking the information that Alex has been giving us and that other intelligent media professionals, brave people have been standing up and giving us.
[01:13:43.295 --> 01:13:48.237]  And we've got to take that information and we've got to turn it into informed action.
[01:13:48.597 --> 01:13:52.198]  Calling in to your governors, calling in to your senators, calling in to your representatives.
[01:13:54.375 --> 01:14:05.241]  Honestly, I'm not an expert on... Creating such a buzz, which is already there, but expanding it to the next octave, never stopping, but just shifting gears into a whole other area of denial.
[01:14:06.382 --> 01:14:21.630]  There are people, two years ago, three years ago, a month ago, a day ago, on the message boards, on the Digg comments, and on our comments, on my websites, saying we're traitors for saying the Federal Reserve is purposefully imploding our currency, and denying it, and saying the dollar is strong.
[01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:23.711]  There is still a cadre of people
[01:14:24.671 --> 01:14:29.112]  Who believe anything this government tells them, and I just wish they knew.
[01:14:29.212 --> 01:14:30.292]  We're their friends!
[01:14:30.992 --> 01:14:33.893]  I mean, you know, we're not happy the government's run by crooks.
[01:14:34.293 --> 01:14:36.253]  We're not happy that they staged the attacks.
[01:14:36.613 --> 01:14:38.374]  We're not saying the whole government's bad.
[01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.794]  I mean, look, we wish it wasn't true!
[01:14:41.094 --> 01:14:43.055]  I mean, but we have to tell the truth!
[01:14:43.455 --> 01:14:47.075]  This is very upsetting, but if we don't, they're not going to stop, folks.
[01:14:47.575 --> 01:14:50.676]  The people running our country will never stop until they are stopped.
[01:14:51.542 --> 01:14:53.463]  Yeah, and we're never going to stop trying to stop them.
[01:14:53.523 --> 01:15:00.448]  I mean, if they think they're going to intimidate people into silence, I mean, that's one of the realizations that I came to yesterday.
[01:15:00.468 --> 01:15:03.270]  I mean, I hadn't really... I did one interview since I've been here in Boston.
[01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:06.392]  I went on WRKO and talked about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:15:06.712 --> 01:15:08.093]  I haven't been as active as I should be.
[01:15:08.493 --> 01:15:10.314]  And so, really, I'm holding myself accountable.
[01:15:10.574 --> 01:15:15.998]  And I guess I just ask all of your listeners to look in the mirror and take the personal responsibility to just refuse to be silent.
[01:15:16.438 --> 01:15:19.460]  Well, you're right, but that's a good way to put it, nosedive the country into an abyss.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.080]  I mean, I don't want to sit here and knock you.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.402]  I mean, you know, you've gone to events wearing a 9-11 inside job shirt.
[01:15:24.462 --> 01:15:25.683]  You've come on this show, some other shows.
[01:15:37.348 --> 01:15:43.315]  I mean, it doesn't all rest with one man, but I'm getting from this that Geraldo kind of threw the gauntlet down to you.
[01:15:43.335 --> 01:15:49.602]  I mean, you saw what that was, and so now I hope not just Daniel Sinjada, but so many other people who are prominent.
[01:15:50.242 --> 01:15:52.585]  And you made a good point yesterday when you called in.
[01:15:52.605 --> 01:15:56.229]  They ignore scientists, physicists, they ignore...
[01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:01.592]  You know, number two in the Japanese parliament over the second largest party.
[01:16:01.973 --> 01:16:09.576]  They ignore former CIA section chiefs, but they'll attack the best actress because she's a woman, she's French, oh look at that, enemy.
[01:16:10.156 --> 01:16:13.177]  They'll attack an actor, they'll take the bait, oh like an actor's dumb.
[01:16:13.417 --> 01:16:20.541]  But the good news is people do pay attention to what actors say and celebrities say over what a former Italian president says.
[01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:23.922]  And so it's very important for more celebrities to go public.
[01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:30.839]  Yeah, yeah, you know, and again, they'll even ignore their own, they'll even ignore the former chief of NIST fire science division.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.481]  They'll ignore their own people.
[01:16:32.882 --> 01:16:41.794]  I mean, you know, come on, they've got people who are guilt-ridden over what they know is an obvious cover-up that they participated in who are coming out and saying, hey, we need to have this independently reviewed.
[01:16:42.174 --> 01:16:43.234]  And they won't even cover that.
[01:16:43.755 --> 01:17:04.441]  I mean, it's just anybody who knows what liars do when they're lying, anybody who has any basic comprehension of psychology can tell that all their behavior indicates and points to the fact that they know they're guilty, they know we know they're guilty, and they are now grasping at straws and doing everything that they possibly can do
[01:17:04.901 --> 01:17:08.003]  To misinform, disinform, and distract people from knowing the truth.
[01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:09.023]  But it's not going to work.
[01:17:09.423 --> 01:17:12.184]  We are going to see some perp walks in the very near future.
[01:17:12.204 --> 01:17:12.765]  It's going to happen.
[01:17:12.985 --> 01:17:13.465]  It's going to happen.
[01:17:13.585 --> 01:17:16.706]  Either that or they're going to push us into martial law and they're going to win.
[01:17:16.747 --> 01:17:17.647]  We don't have a choice.
[01:17:18.187 --> 01:17:20.468]  People who think they can just sit this out, you can't.
[01:17:20.968 --> 01:17:22.229]  These people have to be met.
[01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:28.572]  But just every night when I go to bed, I consciously think about the fact that they are willing to kill 3,000 people.
[01:17:28.932 --> 01:17:32.854]  The folks we're dealing with are bold, are reckless, and are complete psychopaths.
[01:17:33.556 --> 01:17:34.477]  Yeah, they are.
[01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:38.719]  And you know, I can't honestly say that I have no fear, but I'm not going to let my silence me.
[01:17:38.999 --> 01:17:41.321]  I mean, you know, yeah, the thought of, you know, you've said it yourself.
[01:17:41.361 --> 01:17:49.646]  I mean, you, when, you know, these people come back from the, you know, these soldiers come back from Iraq and they end up as our, you know, a lot of them are mentally disturbed.
[01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:51.287]  They're going to end up as our police officers.
[01:17:51.327 --> 01:17:52.668]  They're going to be living next door to us.
[01:17:53.848 --> 01:17:56.330]  We've seen on the videos that you've recently shown,
[01:17:56.970 --> 01:18:06.678]  Uh, on your, on your, on your program, you know, the, the, the torture of the puppy, the shooting up of the cars, the laughing, the, uh, I forget what you call it, psychopath, psychopathic sadism, or something like that?
[01:18:06.718 --> 01:18:08.219]  Yes, yes, psychopathic sadism.
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.741]  This, this is what we have to look forward to, people.
[01:18:10.901 --> 01:18:12.983]  This is what we have to look forward to, and it's coming soon.
[01:18:13.143 --> 01:18:14.084]  These people are coming home.
[01:18:14.444 --> 01:18:20.490]  You know, right now they're stop-lost and being forced into, you know, remaining in the conflict.
[01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:22.331]  But pretty soon we're going to have to face this at home.
[01:18:22.351 --> 01:18:25.254]  What we do abroad, the chickens will come home to roost.
[01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:26.755]  We've got to stop this now.
[01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:29.798]  Daniel Sanjata, final segment with you on the other side.
[01:18:29.898 --> 01:18:35.363]  Always honored to have you pop in and we're really glad that you are deciding to go even more public.
[01:18:36.393 --> 01:18:42.907]  And I just want to get into a few other strategy points with you and any other comments or info you want to put out on the other side.
[01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:45.573]  Then we're going to talk to a lady where they're trying to euthanize her parents.
[01:18:54.053 --> 01:18:55.734]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:18:56.054 --> 01:18:59.535]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:18:59.675 --> 01:19:01.636]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:19:01.716 --> 01:19:04.877]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:19:05.197 --> 01:19:10.719]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:14.920]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:20:56.632 --> 01:20:58.735]  A new world order.
[01:20:59.455 --> 01:21:03.679]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:07.163]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:07.183 --> 01:21:09.425]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:21:09.945 --> 01:21:12.368]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:20.499]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.

[01:21:35.351 --> 01:21:36.492]  Most people have no idea.
[01:21:36.512 --> 01:21:37.292]  They're not after money.
[01:21:37.312 --> 01:21:38.352]  They have all the money they need.
[01:21:38.572 --> 01:21:39.332]  They're after power.
[01:21:39.552 --> 01:21:40.593]  That's what they're after.

[01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:52.197]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:21:52.237 --> 01:21:53.377]  You have been warned.
[01:21:54.312 --> 01:21:59.818]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:22:00.238 --> 01:22:04.463]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:22:04.903 --> 01:22:11.771]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:12.191 --> 01:22:18.896]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:19.217 --> 01:22:20.838]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:22:21.138 --> 01:22:24.321]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:22:24.581 --> 01:22:27.043]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:22:27.363 --> 01:22:33.948]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:22:33.968 --> 01:22:35.349]  Final segment with Daniel Sinjadam.
[01:23:03.326 --> 01:23:06.168]  Known best for his starring roles in Rescue Me.
[01:23:06.188 --> 01:23:08.709]  A lot of other TV programs as well.
[01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:10.190]  Really nice guy.
[01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:10.971]  Big guy, man.
[01:23:10.991 --> 01:23:12.512]  He's like seven feet tall.
[01:23:13.672 --> 01:23:14.813]  Nice guy to meet in person.
[01:23:15.353 --> 01:23:20.836]  He was there when I got arrested by the police, basically the orders of Fox News.
[01:23:21.617 --> 01:23:27.080]  You know, Daniel, I don't know how many of these clips you've seen, but there are probably a hundred of them, where they say the same thing.
[01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:27.801]  Arrest us.
[01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:28.381]  Taser us.
[01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:30.633]  Put us in camps.
[01:23:31.213 --> 01:23:31.994]  We're dangerous.
[01:23:32.034 --> 01:23:33.054]  We're going to be dangerous.
[01:23:33.614 --> 01:23:35.215]  There's no doubt it's a talking point.
[01:23:35.235 --> 01:23:37.815]  They don't just come up with this out of nothing.
[01:23:37.855 --> 01:23:39.476]  They're told to go with this.
[01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:47.258]  And I wonder what it's like to be these MSNBC people and Fox people and even CNN people like Glenn Beck.
[01:23:47.298 --> 01:23:50.019]  I mean, they're all smart.
[01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:51.899]  They've got to know they've sided with evil.
[01:23:52.859 --> 01:23:53.500]  They have to know.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:54.520]  They have to know.
[01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:58.061]  And I don't understand how they can look themselves in the mirror, how they can sleep at night.
[01:23:58.101 --> 01:23:58.481]  I mean, look,
[01:23:59.022 --> 01:24:04.865]  I can't even be on Rescue Me representing firefighters and know what I know and not speak out.
[01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:17.072]  For them to intentionally put out lies, for them to intentionally put out disinformation and misinformation, knowing where this country is headed, I mean, I don't know what kind of deals they've signed with the devil.
[01:24:17.617 --> 01:24:23.321]  But these people, I mean, they've got some serious answering to do to their creator when their lives are said and done.
[01:24:23.361 --> 01:24:25.023]  That's one thing I know for sure.
[01:24:25.343 --> 01:24:32.168]  And just let me say, Alex, you know, I remember the night that you got arrested while we were protesting, and we peacefully marched over.
[01:24:32.188 --> 01:24:33.449]  I'm going to say Luke Rutkowski.
[01:24:34.028 --> 01:24:47.929]  and uh... we are change crew in new york city they handled themselves so peacefully and so professionally i mean we got a single file line we marched over there for we marched from i don't know rockefeller center wherever was he got arrested
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:51.481]  Peacefully marched over to the police precinct where they were holding you.
[01:24:51.801 --> 01:24:58.642]  We stood on the other side of the street without obstructing traffic, against the wall so that people could use the sidewalk.
[01:24:58.922 --> 01:25:02.643]  The police officer stood there laughing and kind of talking to Luke.
[01:25:02.943 --> 01:25:07.824]  He has a great rapport with the officers in the city, who by the way, the police officers and the firefighters, they all know.
[01:25:08.104 --> 01:25:09.845]  They all know 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:25:10.125 --> 01:25:12.926]  They knew that they had arrested you basically because you didn't have an ID.
[01:25:13.226 --> 01:25:14.746]  It's not that you really did anything wrong.
[01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:15.406]  Yeah.
[01:25:15.426 --> 01:25:18.929]  I don't know, I guess we were bullhorning without a permit, but we had to take that opportunity.
[01:25:18.969 --> 01:25:21.351]  I mean, it was just that, you know, they let themselves wide open there.
[01:25:22.932 --> 01:25:32.560]  But I just simply say, I say all this to say that, you know, nothing that we have done indicates any kind of violent tendencies on the part of 9-11 Truth.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.281]  As a matter of fact, it's totally the opposite.
[01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:35.522]  Well, Daniel, you're right, though.
[01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:36.083]  You're right.
[01:25:36.483 --> 01:25:40.086]  But he basically says we are a violent group.
[01:25:40.726 --> 01:25:42.588]  He just lies and says, it's incredible.
[01:25:43.448 --> 01:25:44.089]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:44.589 --> 01:25:45.190]  Unbelievable.
[01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:48.073]  But you know, I mean, obviously, you know, obviously there's an agenda.
[01:25:48.313 --> 01:25:49.955]  Obviously there's a reason why he's saying that.
[01:25:50.276 --> 01:25:54.060]  You know, let me just say, tell another story here real quick, Alex.
[01:25:54.645 --> 01:26:05.267]  Recently, I did a play with Jennifer Garner and Kevin Kline on Broadway called Cyrano de Bergerac, and I was being interviewed by the New York Times ostensibly about my participation in the play.
[01:26:05.807 --> 01:26:12.908]  I wore an Investigate 9-11 t-shirt during the interview, hoping that the interviewer would take the bait and ask me about the t-shirt, and she did.
[01:26:13.848 --> 01:26:22.170]  It just so happened she was informed about my views on 9-11, and we ended up spending about 45 minutes of an hour and a half interview talking specifically about 9-11.
[01:26:23.634 --> 01:26:26.936]  I made sure that I spoke in a way that they could not edit me into obscurity.
[01:26:26.956 --> 01:26:28.477]  I made good points.
[01:26:28.657 --> 01:26:29.758]  I gave references.
[01:26:30.678 --> 01:26:35.301]  She was engaged in the conversation, and I got the impression that she was enjoying the conversation that we were having.
[01:26:35.882 --> 01:26:39.143]  And, lo and behold, wouldn't you know, the interview got killed.
[01:26:39.644 --> 01:26:40.664]  The interview got killed.
[01:26:41.005 --> 01:26:44.347]  And I know it wasn't... Yes, there was a strike on Broadway at that time.
[01:26:44.387 --> 01:26:47.508]  That's when Broadway went dark for about three weeks, and so our show was down.
[01:26:47.528 --> 01:26:50.130]  That's the excuse that the New York Times gave for killing the article.
[01:26:50.566 --> 01:27:01.510]  But my intuition tells me, and I just know, that the reason why they killed that interview was because of the 9-11 content that was in the interview and the fact that I didn't speak in a stumbling, stupid way about it.
[01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:06.812]  I spoke like somebody who was informed, who had done their homework, and they couldn't, as I said before, edit me into obscurity.
[01:27:07.132 --> 01:27:08.612]  And so they just chose to kill the article.
[01:27:08.632 --> 01:27:10.053]  Well, that brings me to the next point.
[01:27:10.153 --> 01:27:15.915]  I hope they would take the bait and maybe have you on one of these Fox News shows to debate them.
[01:27:16.770 --> 01:27:17.651]  Oh, I'd be happy to.
[01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:18.752]  I mean, I'd be happy to.
[01:27:18.812 --> 01:27:21.575]  I mean, they certainly could choose... You know what?
[01:27:21.635 --> 01:27:31.664]  Yes, I wish they would take the bait, thinking that they could get a stupid actor to come on TV, that they could make look stupid, you know, make look dumb like the British... Well, you're anything but stupid, so... Well, thank you for that, Alex.
[01:27:31.684 --> 01:27:32.845]  They're pretty dumb themselves.
[01:27:32.885 --> 01:27:37.109]  I mean, the sophomoric, mindless level that they're at on these TV shows...
[01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:39.071]  It really is.
[01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:45.577]  I mean, they're speaking to the lowest common denominator.
[01:27:45.837 --> 01:27:50.681]  There's nothing mind-expanding about the news that they choose to report.
[01:27:50.701 --> 01:27:54.124]  They'd much rather focus on Britney Spears getting out of a limo without any panties on.
[01:27:54.425 --> 01:28:02.732]  Meanwhile, they're ignoring former FBI and CIA officials who are saying 9-11 was an inside job or we need to have a real investigation.
[01:28:02.752 --> 01:28:03.313]  I mean, come on!
[01:28:03.775 --> 01:28:07.977]  Come on, how can you even compare the newsworthiness of those two stories?
[01:28:08.218 --> 01:28:13.481]  Daniel, do you have a personal website or a place where people can just go check out your thoughts by themselves?
[01:28:13.701 --> 01:28:15.882]  I don't yet, Alex, but I'm going to get on that.
[01:28:15.902 --> 01:28:22.286]  I do have my domain names reserved, but I'm going to go ahead and build websites, and it's not going to be any kind of a shrine to Daniel Sujata.
[01:28:22.326 --> 01:28:22.846]  I'll tell you that.
[01:28:22.866 --> 01:28:24.587]  You'll probably be hard-pressed to find anything about me.
[01:28:24.787 --> 01:28:30.009]  Not personally, but I'm going to definitely, I'm going to try to make them, I'm going to use the awards as my model.
[01:28:30.909 --> 01:28:31.529]  Well, thank you, Daniel.
[01:28:31.549 --> 01:28:35.171]  Daniel, let me get you back up in the near future and not just once a year.
[01:28:35.231 --> 01:28:36.611]  I want to talk to you soon again, okay?
[01:28:37.271 --> 01:28:37.631]  Sure, man.
[01:28:37.651 --> 01:28:38.732]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:28:38.992 --> 01:28:41.193]  Oh, thank you for your courage and thanks for marching with us.
[01:28:41.673 --> 01:28:43.073]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.894 --> 01:28:44.854]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.294 --> 01:28:46.895]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.815 --> 01:28:50.516]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.020]  Alright, Dad.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.281]  Let me get this straight.
[01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:58.602]  I'm sure Hulibirdy takes place in the future, right?
[01:28:58.743 --> 01:28:59.603]  Like, Star Wars?
[01:28:59.763 --> 01:29:00.424]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:29:00.584 --> 01:29:01.564]  Slightly in the future.
[01:29:01.804 --> 01:29:02.585]  Wait a second.
[01:29:02.865 --> 01:29:05.947]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:07.028]  Alright, Einstein.
[01:29:07.188 --> 01:29:09.209]  But it is kinda like Star Wars anyway.
[01:29:09.369 --> 01:29:16.013]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[01:29:16.233 --> 01:29:16.573]  Okay.
[01:29:16.773 --> 01:29:17.554]  So don't tell me.
[01:29:17.874 --> 01:29:19.435]  The government's the bad guy again?
[01:29:19.555 --> 01:29:20.396]  Yep, that's right.
[01:29:20.716 --> 01:29:23.077]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[01:29:23.097 --> 01:29:24.138]  Not exactly.
[01:29:24.438 --> 01:29:26.459]  I know, you're Chewbacca!
[01:29:26.559 --> 01:29:35.441]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:38.242]  Wait a second, they can't track us, it's a free country!
[01:29:38.782 --> 01:29:39.482]  Exactly.
[01:29:40.282 --> 01:29:44.023]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[01:29:53.937 --> 01:29:59.821]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:29:59.941 --> 01:30:11.390]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:12.651]  Here's the story.
[01:30:12.952 --> 01:30:20.821]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:22.183]  And here's the best part.
[01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:23.585]  It's 100% legal.
[01:30:23.965 --> 01:30:30.053]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[01:30:30.373 --> 01:30:31.194]  We're good to go.
[01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:55.450]  Hi neighbor.
[01:30:55.770 --> 01:30:58.492]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:30:59.073 --> 01:31:03.796]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate eating our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[01:31:04.356 --> 01:31:09.480]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:17.166]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[01:31:17.686 --> 01:31:22.590]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:30.252]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[01:31:31.013 --> 01:31:35.454]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[01:31:36.134 --> 01:31:36.414]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:36.434 --> 01:31:36.474]  800-409-5633.
[01:31:36.514 --> 01:31:37.575]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:37.595 --> 01:31:37.955]  Who am I?
[01:31:37.975 --> 01:31:38.255]  Nobody.
[01:32:05.043 --> 01:32:26.435]  Lookin' out your window, baby, now seein' you like to catch Bandits playing Dixie, man got his hand out to bed Thirsty in the Fjord, thirsty in the North Carthage Well, there's sometimes, these times, you know we come as a man and a woman
[01:32:31.332 --> 01:32:36.976]  Okay, she'll be with us about 15 minutes, then I'm going to get back into world news, financial news, huge 9-11 developments.
[01:32:37.677 --> 01:32:43.862]  Bo Dietl, one of the top cops in New York, basically just came right out and admitted 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:32:44.722 --> 01:32:46.724]  But all of his cuss words have to be edited out.
[01:32:46.924 --> 01:32:48.425]  I think John's done with that now.
[01:32:48.465 --> 01:32:49.106]  That's coming up.
[01:32:49.566 --> 01:32:51.167]  I want to apologize to this lady.
[01:32:52.128 --> 01:32:53.609]  And nobody asked me to apologize.
[01:32:53.649 --> 01:32:54.470]  Nobody complained.
[01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:58.873]  I was driving home at about 1 in the morning last night.
[01:32:59.781 --> 01:33:15.134]  from the office, working on a film, and I heard the local rebroadcast of my syndicated Sunday show on the local station, and if you had never heard the show, you'd think I was just a complete meanie.
[01:33:15.574 --> 01:33:22.760]  I wasn't being mean to her, but I would start shouting at her, you know, answer this question, answer that question, and it's because
[01:33:23.696 --> 01:33:25.777]  I am very animalistic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:25.797 --> 01:33:26.857]  I mean, I really am.
[01:33:27.337 --> 01:33:29.057]  Most men want to act like they're animalistic.
[01:33:29.357 --> 01:33:30.358]  I mean, I'm an animal.
[01:33:31.638 --> 01:33:33.318]  I'm also intellectual at the same time.
[01:33:34.219 --> 01:33:45.161]  But I am just a caveman down in the dirt, you know, fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman, be he alive or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread.
[01:33:46.222 --> 01:33:47.602]  I'm a very loving person.
[01:33:49.187 --> 01:33:50.308]  I just love life.
[01:33:50.388 --> 01:33:51.588]  The neighbor's dog came over yesterday.
[01:33:51.608 --> 01:33:52.209]  It's so cute.
[01:33:52.249 --> 01:33:53.109]  It's named Scout.
[01:33:53.129 --> 01:34:00.053]  I was just looking at this dog thinking, God, look at God's creation and just how beautiful the sky was and my children playing in the backyard.
[01:34:00.093 --> 01:34:03.435]  And then I think about the New World Order and it just makes me mad.
[01:34:05.356 --> 01:34:05.736]  You understand?
[01:34:05.756 --> 01:34:07.797]  I mean, I'm a really sweet person.
[01:34:07.817 --> 01:34:12.099]  I'm also a very vicious person on the other side of that coin when it comes to protecting my family.
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.502]  And I literally get to the point where I can't control myself because
[01:34:19.611 --> 01:34:20.411]  She's waiting on the line.
[01:34:20.451 --> 01:34:25.093]  This lady calls in and they took her two parents when they got the flu.
[01:34:25.113 --> 01:34:26.473]  They're 80-something years old.
[01:34:26.493 --> 01:34:27.214]  She's taking care of them.
[01:34:28.954 --> 01:34:38.957]  And basically, the health department, you know, elderly services, they've got different names everywhere, came and took them and took them to hospice when they had the flu and won't give them food or water.
[01:34:38.977 --> 01:34:43.658]  Well, if you don't help somebody when they got the flu and they got it bad, they'll die at their 15 years old.
[01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:48.600]  Much less, I mean, I've had to go to the hospital before when I've had the flu.
[01:34:49.321 --> 01:34:51.542]  For four or five days and I can't eat and nothing's held down.
[01:34:51.562 --> 01:34:53.802]  You know, you take them to my dad.
[01:34:53.842 --> 01:34:54.502]  My dad knows what to do.
[01:34:54.543 --> 01:34:55.243]  Take you to the clinic.
[01:34:55.283 --> 01:34:56.263]  Shoot you up with Finnegran.
[01:34:56.563 --> 01:34:57.383]  You stop vomiting.
[01:34:57.403 --> 01:34:58.164]  The diarrhea stops.
[01:34:58.184 --> 01:34:58.944]  You can hold down fluids.
[01:34:58.964 --> 01:34:59.364]  You're fine.
[01:35:02.285 --> 01:35:03.085]  But they don't do that.
[01:35:03.565 --> 01:35:05.606]  And here's why I go crazy on air.
[01:35:06.266 --> 01:35:09.767]  I have all this knowledge, all this data, all this understanding of how they operate.
[01:35:09.847 --> 01:35:13.828]  Every facet of their operation when it comes to this particular area.
[01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:17.470]  And I know it sounds crazy to the listeners.
[01:35:17.490 --> 01:35:19.190]  There's no way to impart all the knowledge.
[01:35:19.210 --> 01:35:20.531]  There's no way to warn people.
[01:35:22.471 --> 01:35:25.673]  And so I was telling her story for, and she was saying, yes, that's what happened.
[01:35:25.693 --> 01:35:26.473]  Yes, that's what happened.
[01:35:26.493 --> 01:35:27.193]  Yes, that's what happened.
[01:35:27.533 --> 01:35:29.314]  Because it's all compartmentalized.
[01:35:29.374 --> 01:35:30.674]  It's all standardized.
[01:35:31.855 --> 01:35:32.695]  It's eugenics.
[01:35:33.495 --> 01:35:35.916]  I don't want to say Nazi eugenics, because they got it from us.
[01:35:37.317 --> 01:35:41.558]  The big brokerage houses, banks, have lobbied the insurance companies, which they own.
[01:35:42.218 --> 01:35:42.899]  Vice versa.
[01:35:43.139 --> 01:35:43.799]  It's interlocked.
[01:35:45.797 --> 01:35:54.260]  To basically kill old people the first time they get flu after 70 because they want the inheritance tax.
[01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:55.560]  It's built into the model.
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.861]  That's only one facet to it.
[01:35:59.942 --> 01:36:03.463]  And I've interviewed Wesley Smith and I want him back on the Wall Street Journal.
[01:36:03.503 --> 01:36:09.625]  He's done just scores of stories over the years where he lists on air the names of old men, old women, young people.
[01:36:10.766 --> 01:36:14.407]  The media made an issue out of Terri Schiavo because she was paralyzed and couldn't talk.
[01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:20.079]  And they wanted to, they thought they could sell euthanizing people because she looked like a vegetable.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:24.101]  So they made, you know, they gave that attention.
[01:36:24.121 --> 01:36:28.283]  Now good people fought for her, but they gave that attention because they thought it was a good case point.
[01:36:28.603 --> 01:36:35.606]  They don't want it to be Mr. Winland or others who could get up and walk, but who got signed over to the government by their family.
[01:36:35.846 --> 01:36:40.789]  So the government in Los Angeles shamed him down and he begged for food and water for 14 days and died.
[01:36:40.809 --> 01:36:41.649]  And the guy was a sweetheart.
[01:36:43.599 --> 01:36:49.302]  Every time we do these interviews that are multi-hour long, nurses call in and say, yeah, they kill people in our hospital every day.
[01:36:51.162 --> 01:36:52.343]  It's called bioethics.
[01:36:52.403 --> 01:36:53.664]  It's what the boards do.
[01:36:53.944 --> 01:36:56.125]  See, for ten years, they haven't given the Hippocratic Oath.
[01:36:58.165 --> 01:37:00.547]  Hippocrates, you know, I will do no harm as a doctor.
[01:37:01.827 --> 01:37:03.748]  They don't give that anymore for a reason, folks.
[01:37:04.708 --> 01:37:06.209]  Now, the story gets even sicker.
[01:37:06.409 --> 01:37:10.531]  They give her mother, and she didn't give him a flu shot.
[01:37:11.112 --> 01:37:12.192]  You still get the flu regardless.
[01:37:12.212 --> 01:37:13.393]  The last six years in a row.
[01:37:13.893 --> 01:37:14.853]  Look this up for yourself.
[01:37:15.033 --> 01:37:16.494]  They haven't picked the right strain.
[01:37:16.694 --> 01:37:19.255]  They have to guess what mutation it's going to be the year before.
[01:37:19.735 --> 01:37:23.416]  They have to make the vaccine, even if you think they mean well, which of course they don't.
[01:37:24.857 --> 01:37:26.997]  The people giving it do, but the people making it don't.
[01:37:27.037 --> 01:37:27.878]  It's compartmentalized.
[01:37:27.938 --> 01:37:28.658]  Pyramid structure.
[01:37:29.158 --> 01:37:29.698]  Need to know.
[01:37:30.079 --> 01:37:30.759]  Compartmentalized.
[01:37:30.779 --> 01:37:33.960]  So I'm giving you some background that we're going to go to.
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.201]  Her mother's facing a death sentence right now.
[01:37:38.675 --> 01:37:39.996]  She got her dad out of their clutches.
[01:37:40.376 --> 01:37:49.480]  And when I hear this, when I think about our revered elders, and when I think about them doing this, I realize that if they can do it to them, they're going to do it to me, they're going to do it to my kids, to my neighbors.
[01:37:49.921 --> 01:37:54.303]  But it isn't just like a greedy, selfish thing that, oh my God, if they're doing it to somebody else, it could happen to me.
[01:37:54.863 --> 01:37:56.164]  It doesn't need to be conscience.
[01:37:56.484 --> 01:38:02.847]  I, in my very bones, am a healthy tribal person who would take care of my tribe.
[01:38:05.399 --> 01:38:06.359]  And so I understand.
[01:38:06.459 --> 01:38:10.760]  I personalize what's happening to this woman and I go into a red rage.
[01:38:14.921 --> 01:38:15.982]  And I know it's evil.
[01:38:16.062 --> 01:38:16.982]  I have the documents.
[01:38:17.022 --> 01:38:17.562]  We've covered it.
[01:38:17.802 --> 01:38:18.842]  We've had all the guests on.
[01:38:18.862 --> 01:38:20.403]  We've done probably a hundred shows on this.
[01:38:20.803 --> 01:38:22.203]  But that was four, five, six years ago.
[01:38:22.243 --> 01:38:23.403]  I did three, four years of shows.
[01:38:23.423 --> 01:38:24.124]  I'm going to bring them back.
[01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:25.124]  I'm going to do more shows on it.
[01:38:26.744 --> 01:38:28.945]  We have to, you know, continue to bring the old stuff back.
[01:38:29.005 --> 01:38:33.446]  I forget that I've covered stuff, you know, five, six, seven years ago, 50 times and I never covered it again.
[01:38:34.002 --> 01:38:38.323]  I want to walk through all this with you, so we can save lives here.
[01:38:39.623 --> 01:38:43.864]  Now, her parents get sick, she takes them into the hospital.
[01:38:45.224 --> 01:38:47.864]  Of course, they're 80-something years old, they're vomiting, they've got diarrhea.
[01:38:48.684 --> 01:38:51.825]  Any hospital worth its salt knows the standard procedure.
[01:38:51.845 --> 01:38:59.966]  You give them an anti-nausea injection, you put them on IV, 99% of the time they're going to be fine.
[01:39:00.226 --> 01:39:01.467]  They don't do that now, folks.
[01:39:01.707 --> 01:39:03.327]  They have a bioethics policy.
[01:39:05.276 --> 01:39:14.722]  Where the hospital nurse comes in, this nice woman, Barbara Penninger, thinks that she is there with friends, even though she's a listener to the show.
[01:39:15.443 --> 01:39:16.624]  Where do you take your mom and daddy?
[01:39:16.644 --> 01:39:17.244]  She takes them there.
[01:39:19.265 --> 01:39:20.646]  The computer's hooked up to the wall.
[01:39:21.106 --> 01:39:22.107]  The head nurse enters.
[01:39:22.327 --> 01:39:23.488]  Okay, they had their flu shot.
[01:39:23.768 --> 01:39:24.909]  No, I don't believe in that.
[01:39:25.009 --> 01:39:25.309]  Boom.
[01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:28.331]  She calls the adult social services.
[01:39:28.351 --> 01:39:28.812]  They come.
[01:39:29.152 --> 01:39:30.713]  They say, we're taking your parents.
[01:39:30.733 --> 01:39:32.374]  You abused them for not giving them the shot.
[01:39:33.092 --> 01:39:34.032]  But here's the doublespeak.
[01:39:34.112 --> 01:39:35.393]  There's no law, you gotta take the shot.
[01:39:35.453 --> 01:39:37.734]  The shot for the last six years hasn't even been the right strain.
[01:39:37.994 --> 01:39:39.835]  There's more than ten strains out this year.
[01:39:41.316 --> 01:39:42.176]  Doesn't cover you.
[01:39:42.196 --> 01:39:44.057]  Gives you more than three shots.
[01:39:44.097 --> 01:39:45.918]  You have more than a double chance for Alzheimer's.
[01:39:46.558 --> 01:39:48.179]  These are all official numbers.
[01:39:48.479 --> 01:39:50.019]  So, number one, it's your right not to take it.
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:51.060]  Number two, it's bad.
[01:39:52.901 --> 01:39:53.481]  But here's the deal.
[01:39:54.361 --> 01:39:56.982]  Do they see how dare you were taking them away from them?
[01:39:57.043 --> 01:39:58.383]  Give them Finnegran injections.
[01:39:58.703 --> 01:39:59.444]  Give them IV.
[01:39:59.484 --> 01:40:02.425]  No, they swoop them away and take them to a hospice.
[01:40:03.687 --> 01:40:11.211]  And don't give them IV, don't give them anti-nausea, don't give them food or water, and of course, after 6-7 days, they're fried, folks.
[01:40:11.971 --> 01:40:28.219]  This woman fights, goes there, demands IV, gets it after days and days on her daddy, the fluid he needs, this is stuff that would kill a 15 year old who was healthy, gets her dad out, they call social workers saying she's a nut, they won't give
[01:40:29.301 --> 01:40:30.141]  Anything to her mother.
[01:40:30.161 --> 01:40:32.363]  She had to fight to get an IV in her or she'd already be dead.
[01:40:32.603 --> 01:40:34.023]  She's nine days into this now.
[01:40:34.063 --> 01:40:35.424]  She just got an IV two days ago.
[01:40:36.705 --> 01:40:37.685]  Now, I made this woman.
[01:40:37.725 --> 01:40:38.706]  I knew her story was true.
[01:40:38.726 --> 01:40:39.146]  She told it.
[01:40:39.166 --> 01:40:40.086]  I've heard it a million times.
[01:40:40.286 --> 01:40:41.967]  But I made her send me all of it.
[01:40:42.027 --> 01:40:44.448]  Hospital records, their living will, everything.
[01:40:44.508 --> 01:40:45.049]  She sent it.
[01:40:45.349 --> 01:40:46.109]  It's all true.
[01:40:46.169 --> 01:40:46.970]  It's happening now.
[01:40:48.230 --> 01:40:49.311]  And I get these calls every day.
[01:40:49.511 --> 01:40:51.912]  I have to pick occasionally, okay, we'll have you on.
[01:40:52.912 --> 01:40:56.114]  It's like I'm in a lifeboat that holds 20 people and there's 10,000 wanting in the boat.
[01:40:58.914 --> 01:41:04.917]  Now her mama is in there right now with programmed brainwashed cult members.
[01:41:04.937 --> 01:41:05.457]  That's what they are.
[01:41:05.477 --> 01:41:06.497]  The whole society is a cult.
[01:41:06.537 --> 01:41:08.198]  The cops, the hospitals.
[01:41:08.318 --> 01:41:08.818]  It's a cult.
[01:41:09.579 --> 01:41:10.759]  They believe in what they're doing.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.520]  Her mama's in there.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.501]  She's on an IV, barely hanging on.
[01:41:15.281 --> 01:41:16.902]  They won't let her put a feeding tube in her.
[01:41:16.922 --> 01:41:18.483]  They have nine days without giving her anything.
[01:41:18.503 --> 01:41:19.583]  That's why she's in this state.
[01:41:21.224 --> 01:41:23.025]  Now again, you're 20 and you go to the hospital.
[01:41:23.045 --> 01:41:23.885]  They give you Finnegan.
[01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:25.686]  They give you an IV.
[01:41:25.706 --> 01:41:26.086]  You're fine.
[01:41:27.563 --> 01:41:28.904]  But see, it's time for them to die.
[01:41:29.004 --> 01:41:29.184]  They're 80.
[01:41:29.764 --> 01:41:32.225]  They're sucking off the socialist welfare system.
[01:41:32.245 --> 01:41:33.125]  That's how they see it.
[01:41:33.546 --> 01:41:43.970]  When you read the bioethicist boards, this is official US and British papers, they say under Barack Obama and Hillary's system, they will not give health care openly, this is public, to people that are old.
[01:41:45.131 --> 01:41:52.714]  You're going to need to be wealthy and have your own private physicians and have your own lawyers there to not have them kill you like they've been doing in Scandinavia for 20 years.
[01:41:55.057 --> 01:41:57.419]  Now this all goes on under everybody's noses.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.461]  Your kid breaks their finger.
[01:41:59.521 --> 01:42:00.762]  Your mama's got the flu.
[01:42:01.543 --> 01:42:02.664]  You're going to have a baby.
[01:42:02.864 --> 01:42:06.808]  Every hospital enters all your details to social workers instantly.
[01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:12.013]  And so this lady called just to warn people, hey, this isn't just kids they're snatching.
[01:42:12.533 --> 01:42:13.894]  And you're absolutely right, ma'am.
[01:42:13.995 --> 01:42:14.355]  They're not.
[01:42:15.776 --> 01:42:16.817]  So I'm going to shut up.
[01:42:16.877 --> 01:42:18.419]  I've given you the background info.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.481]  And I want to bring up
[01:42:21.596 --> 01:42:23.678]  Barbara Penninger on the air.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:25.821]  That's her married name.
[01:42:26.301 --> 01:42:28.443]  Her folks have another name.
[01:42:28.463 --> 01:42:32.868]  I just had all of the hospital documents here in front of me.
[01:42:32.928 --> 01:42:33.449]  Oh, here they are.
[01:42:34.730 --> 01:42:39.695]  And Barbara, you're a real sweetheart, and I apologize that I began screaming and frothing when you were on the phone.
[01:42:39.735 --> 01:42:42.158]  I wasn't mentally prepared to deal with it.
[01:42:43.608 --> 01:42:49.672]  And I personalized it, which I have a problem psychologically doing, and went into a primitive caveman behavior.
[01:42:49.913 --> 01:42:52.114]  So I apologize for being rude to a lady.
[01:42:52.174 --> 01:42:53.135]  I just was freaking out.
[01:42:55.017 --> 01:42:56.558]  Barbara, are you there?
[01:42:56.598 --> 01:42:57.118]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:57.599 --> 01:42:59.860]  And there's no apology necessary.
[01:43:01.862 --> 01:43:09.248]  With all the ranting and raving and screaming that I've done, I was kind of glad somebody else was screaming along with me.
[01:43:11.262 --> 01:43:18.846]  But it has been a... And like I said, I didn't ever think that I would be on again today.
[01:43:19.966 --> 01:43:33.313]  That was not my intent, because we focus so much on CPS, matching kids, and people don't realize that they will grab the elderly.
[01:43:35.879 --> 01:43:39.040]  Just as easily as they will children.
[01:43:39.301 --> 01:43:39.941]  Let's be clear.
[01:43:40.081 --> 01:43:43.222]  Grabbed them out of the hospital and took them and didn't give them care.
[01:43:43.662 --> 01:43:45.023]  You had to demand the IV.
[01:43:45.243 --> 01:43:46.824]  Now, let's cut to the chase.
[01:43:46.844 --> 01:43:48.064]  You've gotten your papa back.
[01:43:48.344 --> 01:43:49.145]  Tell us his name.
[01:43:49.225 --> 01:43:50.065]  I've got all your documents.
[01:43:50.085 --> 01:43:52.446]  Tell us your mama's full name, where she is.
[01:43:53.146 --> 01:43:55.007]  You've been demanding a feeding tube for days.
[01:43:55.387 --> 01:43:56.487]  How is she doing right now?
[01:43:57.648 --> 01:44:02.650]  Well, they did do the feeding tube surgery this morning.
[01:44:04.008 --> 01:44:05.668]  So we've got the feeding tube in.
[01:44:06.268 --> 01:44:10.749]  I do think we're going to win this fight, and I'm going to tell you Alex, it's because of you.
[01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:19.231]  But if we had not been listening to you for the last couple of years, I would have been totally stupid.
[01:44:19.471 --> 01:44:26.773]  Because these people, these social workers and nurses, I think they really believe they're doing the right thing.
[01:44:28.073 --> 01:44:31.654]  And the way they talk to you, and I feel like I was even tricked
[01:44:32.637 --> 01:44:36.418]  They talk to you like you're an animal, they talk to you like they're God, but we know their tricks.
[01:44:37.138 --> 01:44:40.498]  Yes, and it was like when they asked for the living will.
[01:44:41.539 --> 01:44:49.500]  And I think, of course, I had to threaten to get an attorney and everything before I could get her feeding tube put in.
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:45:02.022]  And if there's no complications, I've been dealing with a social worker this morning, they said that they would let me bring her home in three days if there's no more problems.
[01:45:03.002 --> 01:45:09.630]  They would let you, and their reason for taking her out of your custody is claiming you didn't give them those shots?
[01:45:10.351 --> 01:45:10.672]  Right.
[01:45:11.132 --> 01:45:11.993]  Pieces of filth?
[01:45:12.053 --> 01:45:13.535]  I mean, this isn't a free country.
[01:45:13.575 --> 01:45:14.096]  Sorry, sorry.
[01:45:14.416 --> 01:45:16.439]  This isn't a free country.
[01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:19.002]  It's okay, I understand.
[01:45:19.022 --> 01:45:22.166]  Because I may start doing the same thing here in a minute.
[01:45:23.384 --> 01:45:27.126]  Well, I want to know where your mother is right now.
[01:45:27.307 --> 01:45:27.747]  Where is she?
[01:45:28.227 --> 01:45:34.092]  Okay, right now she is in the hospital in Methodist Hospital North in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:45:35.373 --> 01:45:39.176]  Oh, so they took her out of the hospice and sent her where she should be?
[01:45:40.276 --> 01:45:40.557]  Right.
[01:45:40.937 --> 01:45:44.740]  The hospice ward is still within the hospital.
[01:45:45.901 --> 01:45:47.522]  Okay, she's still in the hospice ward?
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:51.202]  Well, they took her back to the hospice ward.
[01:45:51.662 --> 01:45:54.323]  Now, you sent me some of their medical stuff, but I don't have their full chart.
[01:45:54.604 --> 01:45:56.705]  Did they give them Finagrin when they were admitted?
[01:45:57.405 --> 01:45:57.625]  No.
[01:45:59.046 --> 01:46:00.807]  Did they give them any other anti-nausea?
[01:46:01.167 --> 01:46:02.288]  See, that's another thing.
[01:46:02.308 --> 01:46:09.792]  I don't believe they had the flu, because neither of them were vomiting, diarrhea.
[01:46:09.932 --> 01:46:12.433]  It was nothing like that.
[01:46:13.214 --> 01:46:15.575]  And I didn't believe they had the flu.
[01:46:18.335 --> 01:46:22.518]  I believe it was an upper respiratory infection that turned into pneumonia.
[01:46:22.618 --> 01:46:23.419]  Everybody's had that.
[01:46:23.439 --> 01:46:25.380]  That stuff's everywhere.
[01:46:27.742 --> 01:46:37.268]  Now, they said they got a positive test on my father for influenza, but they have never given me the test results on my mother.
[01:46:37.328 --> 01:46:44.373]  The point is, your parents get sick, you go to the hospital, and they grab them and stick them in a hospice ward,
[01:46:45.094 --> 01:46:47.014]  And some hospices aren't bad, but most are.
[01:46:47.054 --> 01:46:48.295]  It's a whole eugenic system.
[01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:55.236]  And it's just unbelievably disgusting that then... I mean, because you told me that they griped at you until you were bad enough to give them the flu shot.
[01:46:55.816 --> 01:46:56.336]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:56.936 --> 01:47:02.138]  That's why I will have a social worker here every week for the rest of their lives.
[01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:05.518]  Why?
[01:47:05.578 --> 01:47:06.518]  This is a free country.
[01:47:06.719 --> 01:47:11.640]  They just say they're going to be there every day for the rest of their lives?
[01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:13.600]  In this so-called free country?
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:17.121]  Okay, well they haven't said they'll be here for the rest of their lives.
[01:47:17.141 --> 01:47:24.063]  Look, you need to tell them they're not God, and just get your mother back, and then if you have to, even move out of the area if you have to, just get away.
[01:47:24.283 --> 01:47:27.844]  Look, look, there are groups that will help you, there are elderly rights groups that will help you.
[01:47:28.144 --> 01:47:35.707]  These cockroaches are going to try to force your parents when they survive their clutches, and there's no doubt they wouldn't survive if you wouldn't have gotten your daddy out.
[01:47:35.907 --> 01:47:37.547]  Your mama's probably going to survive now, right?
[01:47:39.688 --> 01:47:41.028]  Probably so.
[01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:43.529]  I hope so.
[01:47:44.472 --> 01:47:50.517]  Um, you know, they're, they're both still very, very ill.
[01:47:51.257 --> 01:47:54.120]  And also, while... Do they have them?
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.582]  I mean, have they done a tissue swab to see if they have strep?
[01:47:58.023 --> 01:48:01.225]  There's really bad strep going around, and most people don't even know that.
[01:48:01.685 --> 01:48:05.888]  So they go to an idiot doctor who doesn't even test for strep, and then they put them on something else.
[01:48:05.928 --> 01:48:07.750]  There's really bad strep going around.
[01:48:08.832 --> 01:48:13.134]  Well, see, another thing that happened was... Well, that's what I've got from the files here.
[01:48:13.154 --> 01:48:14.435]  They're not doing real medical care.
[01:48:14.675 --> 01:48:18.197]  They've just got them sitting there in their beds and weren't even going to give them water.
[01:48:18.757 --> 01:48:20.118]  Because, quote, they're in hospice.
[01:48:20.158 --> 01:48:22.119]  They haven't had any real medical care.
[01:48:24.060 --> 01:48:30.363]  See, when they wanted living wills, I went ahead and got them.
[01:48:30.723 --> 01:48:33.704]  Now, the living wills were mainly no life support.
[01:48:34.024 --> 01:48:35.125]  You know, no intubation.
[01:48:36.949 --> 01:48:39.491]  But that's what the Wall Street Journal writer has always shown.
[01:48:39.851 --> 01:48:44.394]  That means that they interpret that to mean you don't want any help.
[01:48:44.894 --> 01:48:48.717]  If you sign these, they will chain you down and kill you, even if you're talking.
[01:48:48.757 --> 01:48:49.057]  Go ahead.
[01:48:49.637 --> 01:48:54.421]  Well, my parents had signed a living will because they did not want to be put on life support.
[01:48:54.681 --> 01:49:01.806]  This was like ten years ago, back when everybody was talking about the life support thing and everything.
[01:49:03.161 --> 01:49:06.884]  When they asked me that when I first walked in, you know, do they have a living will?
[01:49:06.964 --> 01:49:07.604]  Yes, sure.
[01:49:08.225 --> 01:49:13.488]  And it just didn't occur to me what was going to transpire from that.
[01:49:14.369 --> 01:49:19.132]  Because after I brought it in, they were telling me that it wasn't specific enough.
[01:49:20.073 --> 01:49:27.178]  And we had to go over these, and I think... And so now it was to the discretion of the Bioethicist Board, correct?
[01:49:27.973 --> 01:49:36.677]  Right, and even after I signed what I signed, it had to be approved by a doctor from what I had said.
[01:49:37.197 --> 01:49:44.161]  Yeah, what's happening is the hospitals are taking control of our decision making process.
[01:49:44.921 --> 01:49:50.664]  They're mischievous, untrustworthy, very wicked institutions.
[01:49:54.011 --> 01:49:56.553]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.

[01:51:53.329 --> 01:51:59.254]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:51:59.374 --> 01:52:03.618]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:52:03.718 --> 01:52:11.224]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:12.005]  The solution
[01:52:12.185 --> 01:52:16.226]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[01:52:38.834 --> 01:52:43.257]  Alright, we're back live, going right back to our guest Bob Chapman for the Economic Outlook coming up.
[01:52:43.297 --> 01:52:44.037]  Barbara Penninger.
[01:52:44.137 --> 01:52:45.138]  Barbara, why don't I...
[01:53:06.161 --> 01:53:10.684]  Have this posted on Infowars.com, the great letter you wrote, breaking this down.
[01:53:11.004 --> 01:53:12.165]  You get them to the hospital.
[01:53:13.325 --> 01:53:14.926]  Social workers show up immediately.
[01:53:14.946 --> 01:53:17.908]  You've written all this down, saying you didn't give them a flu shot.
[01:53:18.808 --> 01:53:20.409]  They knew because you'd answered the questions.
[01:53:20.429 --> 01:53:25.152]  They didn't tell you, hey, by the way, we're about to try to take your dad from you, when they were asking you these questions.
[01:53:25.192 --> 01:53:28.874]  And they show, come up with a... I mean, this is just a horrible story.
[01:53:28.994 --> 01:53:33.457]  And instead of giving them water and food and taking care of them, they just sit them there.
[01:53:34.292 --> 01:53:46.338]  To die and then you have to fight to make them give them basic medical care and then they counter with the mental illness of you were mean and didn't give them a flu shot and then I read the medical records here it turns out they don't even really have flu.
[01:53:47.475 --> 01:53:53.120]  So, just total sickos, but if you'd have been 18 years old in the hospital, you'd have gotten real care.
[01:53:53.661 --> 01:54:02.388]  The bioethics board says they're meant to basically be pushed off into the hinterland, but then they make you guilty for not giving them the mercury shot.
[01:54:02.789 --> 01:54:08.894]  You said also yesterday on the show that the doctors swore there was no mercury in the shot, and then you showed him on the insert and he got mad?
[01:54:09.755 --> 01:54:11.817]  Yes, that happened in December.
[01:54:12.219 --> 01:54:13.099]  I believe yesterday.
[01:54:13.159 --> 01:54:14.900]  I was kind of getting excited yesterday.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:16.700]  I believe I said October, but it was in December.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:17.800]  Tell folks what happened then.
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:28.582]  In December, I took them for their regular checkup, you know, so they can get their refills on their blood pressure medicine and stuff like that.
[01:54:29.243 --> 01:54:32.123]  And the doctor says, you haven't had your flu shot this year.
[01:54:32.743 --> 01:54:34.824]  And I said, no, and they're not going to get one either.
[01:54:35.464 --> 01:54:36.964]  And he said, why not?
[01:54:37.044 --> 01:54:40.525]  I said, well, the Marisol is in the vaccine.
[01:54:41.472 --> 01:54:45.254]  And we're not getting vaccines this year.
[01:54:46.575 --> 01:54:49.256]  And I've had the flu shot a couple of times.
[01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:51.257]  And that terrifies me.
[01:54:51.657 --> 01:54:52.958]  It absolutely terrifies me.
[01:54:53.018 --> 01:54:53.458]  Oh yeah.
[01:54:54.378 --> 01:54:58.200]  And he said, well, they've taken that out.
[01:54:58.641 --> 01:55:01.182]  I said, well, I would like to see the package insert.
[01:55:01.962 --> 01:55:03.183]  Which that kind of floored him.
[01:55:03.303 --> 01:55:05.324]  He wasn't expecting that.
[01:55:05.384 --> 01:55:06.604]  No, they treat us like we're animals.
[01:55:06.664 --> 01:55:07.525]  Well, what happened next?
[01:55:08.464 --> 01:55:12.628]  He walked out and he came in with the package insert and he said, it's not in there.
[01:55:13.108 --> 01:55:14.429]  And I said, may I see it?
[01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:15.650]  And he said, sure.
[01:55:15.730 --> 01:55:16.651]  He handed it to me.
[01:55:16.671 --> 01:55:18.192]  He obviously didn't look at it.
[01:55:19.233 --> 01:55:25.878]  Obviously he had been... That's why I'm saying, these people have been breaking... No, no, they're comparting the news so that it's out of there and they actually quadrupled it!
[01:55:26.159 --> 01:55:32.764]  They actually put five times in the flu shot, four times in all the other shots, and that's official numbers, but that was in AP.
[01:55:32.804 --> 01:55:35.366]  But go ahead and tell us what it said on the insert.
[01:55:36.159 --> 01:55:37.720]  Uh, it said the Marisol.
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.660]  It was, it was in there and I said, here it is.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:41.721]  It says the Marisol.
[01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:52.104]  And he jerked it out of my hand and looked at it and he walked out of the room and he came back and, you know, finished up and never said another word about it.
[01:55:53.228 --> 01:55:56.611]  He probably reported you to the health workers then.
[01:55:57.191 --> 01:56:00.073]  You probably had a file opening, but they never responded to it.
[01:56:00.533 --> 01:56:02.135]  And that's probably where that began.
[01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:06.818]  Because now, with the pediatrician, you put your three-year-old behind closed doors, does mommy touch you here?
[01:56:07.138 --> 01:56:08.259]  And it's really because they're perverts.
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:10.901]  And the feds are in there making them do it.
[01:56:10.941 --> 01:56:11.802]  The country's gone!
[01:56:12.322 --> 01:56:15.163]  And I do want people to know you're being spied on at every turn.
[01:56:15.503 --> 01:56:19.425]  Not every doctor is bad and every nurse is bad, but like you said, they mean well.
[01:56:19.725 --> 01:56:24.087]  That, just like a Jim Jones cult member or a Charlie Manson cult member meant well.
[01:56:24.527 --> 01:56:26.088]  The Nazis meant well, folks!
[01:56:26.828 --> 01:56:28.889]  The Nazis really thought they were good!
[01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:39.874]  Well, that's why this is so important, that people my age, people who are 50 years old, who have elderly people, elderly parents that they're taking care of,
[01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:43.173]  They've got to go along with them to the doctor.
[01:56:43.234 --> 01:56:47.479]  They can't let them get tricked, you know, into this.
[01:56:48.199 --> 01:56:51.283]  Well, you've also got to educate that hospital.
[01:56:51.363 --> 01:57:00.334]  I would go in there with all the AP Reuters reports about, if you take three of the, just type into Google, more than three, I think the exact headline is three
[01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.950]  They should.
[01:57:03.010 --> 01:57:04.011]  And the hospital has a lot of rules.
[01:57:19.835 --> 01:57:23.879]  And this is something very important that I forgot to put in the... Well, you know what?
[01:57:23.919 --> 01:57:24.379]  Stay there.
[01:57:24.439 --> 01:57:24.719]  Stay there.
[01:57:24.739 --> 01:57:26.641]  I want to come back briefly because Bob Chapman's coming on.
[01:57:26.941 --> 01:57:31.465]  I want to tell people your parents' names, where they're at, to make sure your mother survives.
[01:57:31.545 --> 01:57:33.967]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
[01:57:34.007 --> 01:57:35.208]  Visit gpnlive.com today.
[01:57:50.322 --> 01:57:50.963]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.623 --> 01:57:52.704]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.385 --> 01:57:54.505]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.146 --> 01:57:55.967]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.727 --> 01:57:57.648]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.668 --> 01:58:02.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.472 --> 01:58:06.615]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.436 --> 01:58:10.338]  Alright, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:12.139 --> 01:58:15.722]  Big financial news, total breakdown of the implosion that we're now witnessing.
[01:58:15.762 --> 01:58:16.743]  This is just the beginning.
[01:58:19.558 --> 01:58:20.679]  The total implosion.
[01:58:20.819 --> 01:58:21.919]  I have to be honest with you.
[01:58:21.939 --> 01:58:23.400]  That's what every indicator shows.
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:26.461]  Bob Chapman, expert on all this, coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:27.502 --> 01:58:28.722]  We're talking to a great lady.
[01:58:29.062 --> 01:58:30.263]  She's Barbara Penninger.
[01:58:30.303 --> 01:58:32.384]  Barbara, finish up the point you were going to make.
[01:58:32.464 --> 01:58:34.665]  Tell us your parents' names, where they're at.
[01:58:35.145 --> 01:58:36.286]  You've gotten your daddy back.
[01:58:36.326 --> 01:58:39.567]  You've demanded after nine days a feeding tube for your mama.
[01:58:40.247 --> 01:58:42.949]  You've fought them off, but finish up.
[01:58:43.829 --> 01:58:46.850]  Well, I hate to bring this up now.
[01:58:46.890 --> 01:58:47.791]  It's so close to the end.
[01:58:49.366 --> 01:58:55.249]  One of their rules is if you're over 50 years old, they have to check temperature rectally.
[01:58:56.890 --> 01:59:08.936]  The day after I finally got my father home, I got a call from the doctor's office saying he had contracted a pathogen in the hospital called VRE.
[01:59:10.496 --> 01:59:14.118]  And they wouldn't go into what it was, but they had to call in a medicine.
[01:59:15.138 --> 01:59:16.940]  Uh, for it, and I had to go get it.
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:18.822]  And, uh... And they wouldn't tell you.
[01:59:18.842 --> 01:59:19.802]  They treat you like an animal.
[01:59:20.203 --> 01:59:23.706]  So, basically, they didn't clean... Basically, they didn't clean the thermometer.
[01:59:24.547 --> 01:59:27.149]  Uh, just like the big Hollywood guys.
[01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:35.697]  Two kids almost died when they gave them, like, a thousand times the amount of vitamin K they were supposed to have, and then they treated him like he was bad.
[01:59:36.137 --> 01:59:36.958]  Dennis Quaid.
[01:59:37.398 --> 01:59:41.342]  Of course, I googled VRE and found out that it is passed.
[01:59:41.983 --> 01:59:44.687]  Through rectal thermometers in hospitals.
[01:59:44.987 --> 01:59:45.347]  Of course!
[01:59:45.428 --> 01:59:48.992]  I mean look, 300,000 people died just from this drug diagnosis.
[01:59:49.012 --> 01:59:49.953]  60 minutes at 100 plus thou.
[01:59:51.425 --> 01:59:52.565]  My father's name is Bobby Waldrop.
[01:59:52.605 --> 01:59:53.106]  W-A-L-D-R-O-P Waldrop.
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:24.181]  And my mother is Marie Waldrop.
[02:00:24.661 --> 02:00:28.363]  Okay, and again, tell them which facility they're staying at.
[02:00:28.843 --> 02:00:31.525]  It is, well, now my dad is home.
[02:00:32.405 --> 02:00:37.088]  My mother is at Methodist Hospital North in Memphis.
[02:00:38.828 --> 02:00:45.552]  But just so you'll know, the only thing that will cure VRE is a drug called Vioxx.
[02:00:46.512 --> 02:00:47.413]  I'm sorry, Zyvox.
[02:00:47.613 --> 02:00:48.213]  Z-Y-V-O-X.
[02:00:50.689 --> 02:00:52.830]  And for 20 pills, it is $1,500.
[02:00:53.031 --> 02:00:54.572]  Oh, I know.
[02:00:54.852 --> 02:00:58.934]  You ought to make them pay for it, because they didn't clean the rectal thermometer.
[02:01:00.215 --> 02:01:00.875]  Look, look, look.
[02:01:01.256 --> 02:01:02.757]  Just pure evil.
[02:01:03.117 --> 02:01:04.658]  Look, keep me abreast of the situation.
[02:01:04.698 --> 02:01:07.119]  We're going to post the story you sent us, okay?
[02:01:07.139 --> 02:01:07.299]  Okay.
[02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:08.200]  Is that okay?
[02:01:10.223 --> 02:01:11.023]  That is fine.
[02:01:11.103 --> 02:01:12.704]  And we're not going to post any of the private stuff.
[02:01:13.164 --> 02:01:14.585]  And God bless you, my dear.
[02:01:14.605 --> 02:01:17.486]  And of course, your case is nothing compared to many.
[02:01:17.526 --> 02:01:19.787]  But I want to thank you for calling in to warn people.
[02:01:20.128 --> 02:01:23.829]  Because by being quiet, they would just get away with more and more of this.
[02:01:23.869 --> 02:01:24.810]  So it was good talking to you.
[02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:26.511]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:01:27.331 --> 02:01:28.051]  Take care, my dear.
[02:01:28.091 --> 02:01:29.552]  What a great lady taking care of her parents.
[02:01:29.572 --> 02:01:33.634]  She could just be yuppie scum and just warehouse them and let them die like most people do.
[02:01:37.636 --> 02:01:38.196]  There you go.
[02:01:39.272 --> 02:01:41.673]  Hey, you don't believe me that Mercury is just going with vaccines?
[02:01:41.713 --> 02:01:45.636]  Just go to the doctor, act like you want a shot and say, by the way, can I see that insert?
[02:01:47.957 --> 02:01:50.278]  And then have them tell you it's not in there and then read it's in there.
[02:01:51.739 --> 02:01:52.719]  See, don't believe me.
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:54.420]  Don't believe me.
[02:01:55.461 --> 02:01:56.181]  Go look it up.
[02:01:57.262 --> 02:01:58.403]  Cops listening right now.
[02:01:58.903 --> 02:02:02.505]  You don't believe sodium chloride was put in the water to brain damage you and me and everybody else?
[02:02:03.638 --> 02:02:04.919]  You think I'm a cook, don't you?
[02:02:05.279 --> 02:02:12.261]  Why don't you go find out, and find out who really runs things, and get your head around what we're really dealing with here!
[02:02:14.542 --> 02:02:15.783]  This is a nightmare!
[02:02:16.263 --> 02:02:24.846]  Psychopathic scientist elites who think they're God, having their way with us with a bunch of compartmentalized monkeys, running these hospitals, schools, everything else!
[02:02:25.678 --> 02:02:26.878]  Y'all make me sick!
[02:02:27.339 --> 02:02:29.899]  All of you that follow your orders and don't know what's going on!
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:33.361]  The Bible says they perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:02:33.441 --> 02:02:35.621]  Stop having lack of knowledge!
[02:02:36.241 --> 02:02:39.062]  At least don't give your kids the sodium fluoride water!
[02:02:39.943 --> 02:02:42.063]  At least don't give them the mercury vaccines!
[02:02:42.443 --> 02:02:43.964]  At least care about your children!
[02:02:46.147 --> 02:02:58.870]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:06.012]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:03:06.372 --> 02:03:06.812]  We're good to go.
[02:03:36.152 --> 02:03:36.572]  We're good to go.
[02:03:45.879 --> 02:03:46.540]  It's progressing.
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:50.865]  And it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[02:03:51.345 --> 02:03:52.767]  We are entering martial law.
[02:03:53.248 --> 02:03:55.410]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.
[02:03:55.951 --> 02:03:57.172]  America has them all.

[02:04:47.846 --> 02:04:49.308]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:49.408 --> 02:04:52.330]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:55.312]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:55.332 --> 02:04:58.174]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[02:04:58.735 --> 02:05:05.201]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:46.924 --> 02:05:52.946]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.566 --> 02:05:56.587]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:04.831 --> 02:06:12.874]  Well, we've taken you to Tibet with the chairman of the governmental organization in absentia in India.
[02:06:14.102 --> 02:06:18.124]  Chairman of that organization exposing the mass murder and tyranny by the Red Chinese over there.
[02:06:19.745 --> 02:06:33.293]  We've also covered what's happening in the markets in the first hour, then we covered the police state in 9-11 in the last hour and how they're trying to euthanize the old in this country with the government social workers, not just the children they're trying to get.
[02:06:34.053 --> 02:06:38.276]  They just want to get your children and put them on a bunch of drugs and leverage up the money they get.
[02:06:38.336 --> 02:06:41.458]  They get $200,000 a year if they get them on drugs, or adopt them out for $500,000.
[02:06:43.792 --> 02:06:46.253]  And now we're going to get back into the economy and where all this is going.
[02:06:46.273 --> 02:06:47.193]  This is a big issue.
[02:06:47.213 --> 02:06:48.934]  You're going to have continual coverage.
[02:06:48.954 --> 02:06:51.875]  We're going to have the head of the New York Business School on again this week.
[02:06:51.915 --> 02:06:53.756]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on again this week.
[02:06:54.096 --> 02:06:56.097]  I'm trying to get Stiklitz back on again this week.
[02:06:56.717 --> 02:07:02.579]  But somebody who's really a straight shooter and been in this business forever and has been spot on is Bob Chapman.
[02:07:02.599 --> 02:07:03.980]  We're going to him in one moment.
[02:07:04.020 --> 02:07:05.821]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:07:06.301 --> 02:07:11.403]  Before I do that, I am trying to help third world children in Africa, in the Philippines.
[02:07:12.361 --> 02:07:17.345]  Sponsoring a girl in the Philippines, a boy in, of course, the Philippines.
[02:07:18.426 --> 02:07:20.588]  And his name is Kent in the Philippines.
[02:07:20.968 --> 02:07:23.270]  His family earns $175 per month.
[02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:24.491]  His age is 10 years old.
[02:07:25.812 --> 02:07:36.000]  And folks, $22 a month gets these children, and I'm sponsoring too, food, shoes, clothing,
[02:07:36.906 --> 02:07:37.867]  Basic education.
[02:07:37.907 --> 02:07:39.007]  It's a good organization.
[02:07:39.067 --> 02:07:44.110]  My parents had fostered, you know, through this, two kids whenever I was growing up.
[02:07:44.170 --> 02:07:51.995]  My uncle lived in Guatemala on work he did and lived next door to people who were running this operation in Guatemala.
[02:07:52.015 --> 02:07:52.935]  They were really good people.
[02:07:54.296 --> 02:07:56.157]  So I check into charities before I promote them.
[02:07:56.177 --> 02:08:03.141]  If you go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or truthnews.us or ronpaulwarren.com, you'll see the Children International banners.
[02:08:03.641 --> 02:08:04.181]  Link through.
[02:08:04.281 --> 02:08:04.962]  Look at the children.
[02:08:05.638 --> 02:08:06.279]  Pick a child.
[02:08:06.339 --> 02:08:06.679]  Help them.
[02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:08.861]  Sponsor them.
[02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:09.441]  Don't wait.
[02:08:10.182 --> 02:08:13.025]  I know things are getting tough in this country, but that's the time to help others.
[02:08:14.026 --> 02:08:17.168]  Believe me, the UN and the globalists aren't helping them, and Children International is.
[02:08:18.710 --> 02:08:21.812]  Okay, going to Bob Chapman.
[02:08:23.214 --> 02:08:29.499]  Bob, every expert I've had on, you, Dr. Roberts, the New York School of Business guy, the
[02:08:33.775 --> 02:08:37.397]  Shadow Trends fellow who tracks the government's fake numbers.
[02:08:39.298 --> 02:08:50.043]  Everybody's saying depression within the next year or two, but I know you guys are being conservative, but it looks like, to me, the unraveling's happening faster than even what Joseph Stiklitz and you said.
[02:08:50.063 --> 02:09:00.889]  I mean, I know you're being conservative, so your estimations and your forecast will come in correctly, but am I wrong in saying it looks like this is starting to happen faster than you thought?
[02:09:02.874 --> 02:09:14.286]  It could be, but, you know, as you get older and you look back, you see that things, even in today's age, don't happen usually as fast as you think that they will.
[02:09:15.227 --> 02:09:17.009]  I'm giving them two to three years out.
[02:09:17.409 --> 02:09:18.891]  If there's no one to award acts,
[02:09:19.537 --> 02:09:31.761]  The last untoward act was the lady who works for Oppenheimer, Meredith Whitney, who is a bank analyst who came out and said, gee, I think Citigroup's got some serious problems.
[02:09:32.181 --> 02:09:33.642]  And that's how this all began.
[02:09:34.522 --> 02:09:36.142]  She opened up the Pandora's box.
[02:09:36.162 --> 02:09:40.324]  So you never know when all of a sudden something like that's going to pop up.
[02:09:42.095 --> 02:09:54.124]  That's possible, but not probable, so... But wait a minute, that happened two weeks ago when Greenspan went over and talked to the group of Arabs, the oil producing states, and told them to dump the dollar.
[02:09:54.404 --> 02:10:04.532]  So all the evidence I see shows they're trying to drive down the dollar, cutting interest rates, knowing that's going to happen, but now it looks like it can't even save the brokerage funds or the stock market, like they're going to blow everything!
[02:10:06.213 --> 02:10:08.655]  Well, they will save them selectively.
[02:10:08.835 --> 02:10:10.176]  You've got to remember that
[02:10:11.011 --> 02:10:14.933]  There are banks within the banking system that own the Federal Reserve.
[02:10:15.533 --> 02:10:16.593]  Their shareholders do.
[02:10:17.334 --> 02:10:19.334]  And so, they're not going to allow them to go under.
[02:10:21.055 --> 02:10:27.157]  And so, you have the Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, J.P.
[02:10:27.197 --> 02:10:28.698]  Morgan Chase, etc.
[02:10:28.898 --> 02:10:29.818]  They're not going under.
[02:10:30.719 --> 02:10:34.580]  Not part of that group was Bear Stearns.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:39.262]  And also, Bear Stearns refused to join them in the bailout
[02:10:39.875 --> 02:10:41.355]  of LTCM in 1998.
[02:10:42.696 --> 02:10:43.976]  And they've never forgotten that.
[02:10:44.196 --> 02:10:45.336]  It was payback time.
[02:10:46.377 --> 02:10:54.679]  And Morgan paid $2 a share for a stock that was selling for $170 about 8 or 10 months ago.
[02:10:55.759 --> 02:11:01.621]  And incidentally, one-third of the stock in Bear Stearns was owned by their employees.
[02:11:01.741 --> 02:11:06.082]  So not only are they going to take horrendous losses, almost 100%,
[02:11:09.736 --> 02:11:18.306]  I'm going to pick your brain here today because there's so much going on we can get stuck on one facet.
[02:11:18.326 --> 02:11:23.712]  A, that we're talking about two to three years and that seems to be what all the experts are saying.
[02:11:25.053 --> 02:11:26.395]  Why still two to three?
[02:11:27.210 --> 02:11:33.632]  Because, you know, I mean, you said last year we'd see the earnings come in, that that would precipitate more of these imploding.
[02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:37.253]  We have the Carlisle financial imploding, going completely bankrupt.
[02:11:38.074 --> 02:11:40.635]  Now they're talking about other major houses going bankrupt.
[02:11:40.695 --> 02:11:43.816]  I mean, you still see this on trend for two to three years?
[02:11:45.436 --> 02:11:48.557]  Yes, I do, because they're going to continue to create money and credit.
[02:11:48.577 --> 02:11:53.919]  They're going to inject money into the system just like they are now, $200 billion this month.
[02:11:54.665 --> 02:12:11.355]  And the collateral that's being given is junk bonds for all intents and purposes, and eventually what's going to happen is the banks that receive that money are part of the Federal Reserve System, and they're part of the owners of the Fed.
[02:12:12.155 --> 02:12:20.380]  They're not going to be allowed to go under, so they're going to keep the money, and the Fed is going to keep the toxic garbage, if you want to call it that.
[02:12:21.084 --> 02:12:28.851]  And what happens next is eventually the Fed sells that stuff, but they don't care whether they take a loss or not, because they created the money out of thin air!
[02:12:29.431 --> 02:12:33.415]  But that will devalue... And they'll pay for all this, the public, with massive inflation.
[02:12:33.975 --> 02:12:34.435]  Exactly.
[02:12:34.656 --> 02:12:37.658]  And then they'll claim we've got to pay taxes back for it, too.
[02:12:38.159 --> 02:12:39.700]  So we'll get double hit, right?
[02:12:40.321 --> 02:12:41.782]  I just got a piece from Ron Paul.
[02:12:41.822 --> 02:12:46.646]  He said they're setting up the legislation now to increase taxation to pay for all of this.
[02:12:47.478 --> 02:12:48.699]  Yeah, well, I've seen that coming in.
[02:12:48.719 --> 02:12:49.879]  Yeah, they say exactly.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:56.903]  Tripling the cops, just sucking off of us, tickets everywhere, fines, fees, global warming taxes.
[02:12:56.943 --> 02:13:00.105]  They admit that's going to pay... Man, it's going to be hellish, Bob.
[02:13:02.046 --> 02:13:07.849]  Well, when you get the court case in Washington, D.C., they're going to try to take away the guns.
[02:13:08.369 --> 02:13:08.509]  Yeah.
[02:13:08.529 --> 02:13:11.191]  And if they do that, they're liable to have a revolution on their hands.
[02:13:12.336 --> 02:13:25.107]  Oh yeah, they're going to rule against the Second Amendment and then spin it and say it was a pro-Second Amendment rule, and they're going to say, oh, you have a right, but we can restrict it, and they're going to call it a victory, and the NRA will tell its people to stand down, and people will probably just hand them in.
[02:13:27.048 --> 02:13:32.493]  Well, my advice is make sure you've got plenty of Cosmoline and start burying.
[02:13:34.294 --> 02:13:35.575]  Cosmoline, that grease.
[02:13:35.935 --> 02:13:38.878]  Now, Bob, they're talking about other
[02:13:40.123 --> 02:13:44.624]  Big groups like Lehman Brothers shares hit as domino speculation grows.
[02:13:45.544 --> 02:13:52.346]  How far do you think this dominoing as huge brokerage funds and huge outfits implode?
[02:13:53.066 --> 02:13:54.067]  Do you think it's going to domino?
[02:13:56.507 --> 02:14:00.829]  Well, they're going to try to extend it out as long as possible.
[02:14:01.829 --> 02:14:06.370]  And that way it won't totally, completely, quickly impact the market.
[02:14:07.285 --> 02:14:10.747]  And that's what they're hoping for, and people like Lehman are going to be helped.
[02:14:13.568 --> 02:14:16.229]  Now, down the road... They're going to make $20 million, they're going to get it.
[02:14:16.509 --> 02:14:19.110]  Down the road, though, this is going to make the implosion worse, isn't it?
[02:14:20.231 --> 02:14:20.971]  Absolutely.
[02:14:21.291 --> 02:14:23.352]  Because they can't keep on doing it indefinitely.
[02:14:23.692 --> 02:14:28.294]  They did exactly the same thing during the early 1930s.
[02:14:28.875 --> 02:14:29.875]  And you saw what happened.
[02:14:33.077 --> 02:14:35.958]  Just super hyperinflation and inflationary depression.
[02:14:38.109 --> 02:14:42.012]  That's right, and that's why it's so important that people have gold and silver-related assets.
[02:14:43.293 --> 02:14:49.097]  In fact, I have never seen worse market manipulation than what I saw this morning.
[02:14:49.677 --> 02:14:50.738]  It is so blatant.
[02:14:51.278 --> 02:14:55.201]  Anybody on Wall Street is a professional who doesn't see it as a nincompoop.
[02:14:55.461 --> 02:14:57.903]  Okay, well, I'm a novice, but tell me if I'm right.
[02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:01.451]  Gold opens at 8 o'clock in the morning in New York.
[02:15:01.931 --> 02:15:02.571]  It shoots up to $9.30.
[02:15:02.731 --> 02:15:06.072]  And then they dump masses of IMF gold.
[02:15:06.352 --> 02:15:09.193]  They pull all sorts of shenanigans and drive it down to $1,000.
[02:15:10.774 --> 02:15:12.074]  Then it shoots back up to $1,015.
[02:15:13.054 --> 02:15:17.796]  That tells me their old tricks aren't working anymore.
[02:15:19.396 --> 02:15:20.076]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:15:20.197 --> 02:15:21.537]  But that's what they are doing.
[02:15:21.597 --> 02:15:25.178]  But what they're selling or whether they're shorting, I don't know right now.
[02:15:25.258 --> 02:15:28.059]  But I do know the commercial shorts on the ComEx
[02:15:29.145 --> 02:15:30.986]  Their shorts are almost at record levels.
[02:15:31.506 --> 02:15:33.487]  Now, I was a trader for 25 years.
[02:15:33.507 --> 02:15:34.887]  I own my own brokerage firm.
[02:15:35.847 --> 02:15:41.990]  And never could it be that all of the commercials were all net short.
[02:15:42.490 --> 02:15:43.350]  It's impossible.
[02:15:43.770 --> 02:15:49.092]  So that has to mean that the United States government is guaranteeing them against losses.
[02:15:51.853 --> 02:15:57.275]  Explain that in layman's terms for people that don't understand the types of mechanisms.
[02:15:58.548 --> 02:16:06.894]  Professionals in the market who make markets, they're the ones that you go to when you purchase or you sell, we'll say gold.
[02:16:07.955 --> 02:16:14.400]  And usually, historically, most of the time, the professionals are short.
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:17.202]  That means they're betting that gold's going to go down.
[02:16:18.162 --> 02:16:22.646]  And if they're in the stock market, they're betting stocks are going to go down, or particular stock.
[02:16:23.606 --> 02:16:25.728]  And that's just the way professionals operate.
[02:16:27.865 --> 02:16:34.450]  I have never seen all of the professionals all record short at the same time.
[02:16:35.111 --> 02:16:41.836]  And the only thing that can induce that is guarantee that you can't have a loss.
[02:16:42.376 --> 02:16:50.202]  And the only one that can guarantee that, that indirectly controls the exchanges and the final analysis, is the United States government.
[02:16:54.466 --> 02:16:57.508]  So we're entering complete financial Alice in Wonderland.
[02:16:58.809 --> 02:16:59.530]  Absolutely.
[02:17:00.251 --> 02:17:02.953]  And Wall Street is catching on.
[02:17:03.013 --> 02:17:09.379]  That's why commodities and gold and silver are going bonkers, because they're sliding their money over there.
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:20.850]  At the same time, this Federal Reserve and the Treasury and the Working Group of Financial Markets, of which they're all involved in, that's why they're having a hard time keeping the stock market up.
[02:17:21.291 --> 02:17:24.434]  Because money's leaving and going over into gold and silver commodities.
[02:17:24.887 --> 02:17:29.133]  And that's going to get greater and greater and greater as we go out over the next two years.
[02:17:30.194 --> 02:17:32.097]  Bob Chapman, I want to continue to pick your brain.
[02:17:32.137 --> 02:17:35.000]  TheInternationalForecaster.com, always honored to have you.
[02:17:35.461 --> 02:17:40.408]  Quick break, we'll be right back with Bob as we continue to analyze the unraveling that's happening right now.
[02:17:46.152 --> 02:17:47.834]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:17:48.154 --> 02:17:51.618]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:17:51.779 --> 02:17:53.681]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:17:53.701 --> 02:17:56.984]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:17:57.305 --> 02:18:02.831]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:18:03.091 --> 02:18:07.056]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:18:07.356 --> 02:18:12.281]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:18:42.867 --> 02:18:44.308]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:18:44.668 --> 02:18:45.408]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.382]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:18:48.402 --> 02:18:50.784]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:18:50.904 --> 02:18:53.868]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:18:53.928 --> 02:18:54.608]  is a real thing.
[02:18:54.709 --> 02:19:01.596]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:19:01.716 --> 02:19:06.982]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:19:07.142 --> 02:19:07.903]  We're good to go!
[02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:37.908]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[02:19:37.988 --> 02:19:42.732]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[02:19:42.893 --> 02:19:45.695]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:19:46.936 --> 02:19:48.337]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:48.357 --> 02:19:50.459]  A new world order.
[02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:55.563]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:56.084 --> 02:19:57.825]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:19:57.945 --> 02:20:01.068]  Doesn't their objective be world domination?
[02:20:01.676 --> 02:20:04.101]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:04.862 --> 02:20:12.196]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:20.203]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:20.663 --> 02:20:24.125]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:24.505 --> 02:20:27.026]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:27.086 --> 02:20:28.227]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:28.247 --> 02:20:29.007]  They're not after money.
[02:20:29.027 --> 02:20:30.108]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:30.308 --> 02:20:30.728]  They're after power.
[02:20:30.768 --> 02:20:31.969]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:20:32.449 --> 02:20:36.991]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:20:40.914 --> 02:20:43.555]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:20:43.935 --> 02:20:45.195]  You have been warned.
[02:20:46.996 --> 02:20:50.356]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:20:50.496 --> 02:20:55.718]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:20:55.898 --> 02:21:00.699]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:21:00.959 --> 02:21:12.081]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:21:12.381 --> 02:21:17.924]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:21:18.144 --> 02:21:24.227]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:21:24.427 --> 02:21:25.068]  What about you?

[02:21:59.686 --> 02:22:16.419]  There must be some kind of way out of here folks We've got one of the real experts out there, and we always appreciate him bringing his intellect the show I'm jumping in a lot because there's so many points so many questions.
[02:22:16.459 --> 02:22:16.919]  I've got I
[02:22:18.849 --> 02:22:38.626]  Bob, I remember the IMF documents that I make such a big deal out of from 2002, where they talked about how they engineer the implosions of economies, how they issue all the credit, the big banks, and like you said, the banks on the Federal Reserve, they position themselves safely, then they cause domino effects to blow out the mid-level and even larger banks to consolidate.
[02:22:40.868 --> 02:22:44.892]  But then you and others say this may be something that even hurts them,
[02:22:46.169 --> 02:22:47.750]  But I do see a method to the madness.
[02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:57.173]  How much of this is just greed and out-of-control behavior, and how much of this is the larger, mega-institutional banks just having a payday?
[02:22:59.174 --> 02:23:01.055]  Well, first of all, they planned this.
[02:23:01.795 --> 02:23:04.896]  Second of all, everything went haywire for them in the Middle East.
[02:23:05.796 --> 02:23:15.420]  They tried to reverse the program for Europe, the United States, and Canada that they set in place to demolish their economies and their financial systems.
[02:23:16.902 --> 02:23:17.703]  They couldn't stop it.
[02:23:18.443 --> 02:23:24.687]  And then, as I explained earlier, this lady came along and said, hey, all these people don't have any clothes on.
[02:23:25.408 --> 02:23:27.669]  And glory be, they didn't.
[02:23:28.409 --> 02:23:30.271]  And the whole thing came tumbling down.
[02:23:30.891 --> 02:23:34.093]  And so it's something that they're into that is out of control.
[02:23:34.113 --> 02:23:38.215]  That's both the Fed, the Treasury, and the markets.
[02:23:39.056 --> 02:23:43.739]  And it's only a matter of time before it comes unglued further and further and further.
[02:23:44.563 --> 02:23:47.624]  And they're hoping that they can last it out.
[02:23:47.664 --> 02:23:57.645]  Well, they did the same thing between 1929 and 1931, in apposition to what Milton Friedman had to say, which was totally wrong.
[02:23:57.665 --> 02:23:59.246]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:24:00.386 --> 02:24:09.187]  People are saying there's incredible parallels for that year and a half, two years, where the stock market went up and down and where they pumped money into all the big firms.
[02:24:09.468 --> 02:24:11.288]  And people are saying it's a carbon copy.
[02:24:11.328 --> 02:24:11.908]  Is that accurate?
[02:24:13.634 --> 02:24:14.235]  It's close.
[02:24:14.795 --> 02:24:19.279]  The only thing is the leverage now is, I don't know, 20, 30 times what it was then.
[02:24:19.299 --> 02:24:36.271]  At that time we had a relatively homogeneous population, low crime, people saved, people walked around with $20 gold pieces in their pockets until depression took hold.
[02:24:37.412 --> 02:24:38.193]  It's different today.
[02:24:39.326 --> 02:24:42.527]  People don't have gold coins or gold bullions, so to speak.
[02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:43.648]  They don't live on a farm.
[02:24:44.988 --> 02:24:45.968]  They don't live on a farm.
[02:24:46.969 --> 02:24:50.490]  There's a relatively high crime rate compared to the 1930s.
[02:24:51.410 --> 02:24:54.031]  And people should know better today, and they don't.
[02:24:54.911 --> 02:24:56.932]  And the reason why is they just don't care.
[02:24:59.172 --> 02:25:01.553]  It is going to be an absolute bad one.
[02:25:02.413 --> 02:25:07.615]  Bob, you know, you've been in Army Intelligence, Counterintelligence, you've been, you know, the biggest financial newsletter out there.
[02:25:08.537 --> 02:25:16.402]  Well, I think as the economy degenerates into recession, depression, more people will be out of work, their benefits will run out, our taxes are going to go up at the worst possible time, of course, and
[02:25:37.788 --> 02:25:46.813]  The dislocation is going to be terrible, because you have all these people losing their homes, then their cars, then their jobs, and you've got an awful lot of people living under bridges.
[02:25:47.853 --> 02:25:50.374]  And desperate people do desperate things.
[02:25:51.115 --> 02:25:54.076]  And that's why government wants to get the weapons away from people.
[02:25:54.276 --> 02:26:04.742]  There's about 450 million of them in the United States, and they desperately want them, because they don't want the people to fight back, because that is going to be the natural outgrowth of what they're doing.
[02:26:04.802 --> 02:26:05.562]  And they know that.
[02:26:06.326 --> 02:26:22.278]  And so it's extremely important that people never give up their weapons irrespective of the possibilities that are put before you in keeping them when you shouldn't have them, like, you know, going to an internment camp.
[02:26:23.179 --> 02:26:25.581]  And so they can pry them from my dead, cold fingers.
[02:26:26.041 --> 02:26:29.664]  But I mean, this mess is so big, Bob, just looking at it from my perspective,
[02:26:30.652 --> 02:26:32.654]  This isn't Tibet where nobody's got guns.
[02:26:32.714 --> 02:26:38.499]  If 1% of 100 million gun owners, and it's more than that, fights back, their butts kicked any way you cut it.
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.782]  And 1% will... They know that, too.
[02:26:42.203 --> 02:26:44.785]  And that's why we can't allow them to do that.
[02:26:45.286 --> 02:26:53.173]  Because they will drag those 210,000 mercenaries out of the Middle East and bring them back here, because for 200 grand a year, they'll kill anybody.
[02:26:55.735 --> 02:26:56.076]  Idiots.
[02:26:57.665 --> 02:27:02.427]  I mean, murder for hire today, it's easy to get somebody murdered for 30 or 40 or 50 grand.
[02:27:04.388 --> 02:27:05.469]  That's just the way it is.
[02:27:05.809 --> 02:27:06.549]  Believe me, I know.
[02:27:06.609 --> 02:27:07.730]  But it goes on every day.
[02:27:09.090 --> 02:27:11.431]  Of course, our government, when they do it, they pay far less.
[02:27:14.573 --> 02:27:14.953]  I know.
[02:27:15.613 --> 02:27:19.775]  And they tell us the people doing this are good patriots.
[02:27:19.855 --> 02:27:21.616]  Most of them are felons or illegal aliens.
[02:27:22.856 --> 02:27:26.278]  And the good ones that aren't... Well, most of them are disordered, believe me, that's for sure.
[02:27:26.869 --> 02:27:27.909]  Yeah, they got mental problems.
[02:27:27.989 --> 02:27:28.650]  Bob, stay there.
[02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:32.911]  Let's come back and talk about how to protect ourselves and I got a bunch of other stuff here.
[02:27:35.992 --> 02:27:36.913]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.373 --> 02:27:39.014]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.894 --> 02:27:42.615]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.167 --> 02:27:48.007]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:27:48.227 --> 02:27:51.268]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:27:51.508 --> 02:27:56.129]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:59.089]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:27:59.369 --> 02:28:04.230]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[02:28:04.450 --> 02:28:06.211]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:28:06.431 --> 02:28:12.152]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:28:12.412 --> 02:28:14.112]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:28:14.432 --> 02:28:18.414]  Yes, SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:28:18.854 --> 02:28:29.860]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at the regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:35.323]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[02:28:35.543 --> 02:28:38.565]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[02:28:38.585 --> 02:28:39.085]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:28:41.446 --> 02:28:44.629]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[02:28:45.669 --> 02:28:51.333]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:28:51.514 --> 02:28:56.657]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:28:56.937 --> 02:29:02.021]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:29:02.321 --> 02:29:05.884]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[02:29:06.685 --> 02:29:14.191]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:29:14.431 --> 02:29:17.974]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:29:18.214 --> 02:29:22.778]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:29:23.059 --> 02:29:23.839]  Do your part!
[02:29:24.099 --> 02:29:26.361]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:29:26.722 --> 02:29:32.847]  AlkaVision Plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[02:29:33.147 --> 02:29:35.549]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.

[02:29:42.375 --> 02:29:43.796]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:29:45.071 --> 02:29:45.351]  Fact.
[02:29:45.532 --> 02:29:51.478]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:29:51.579 --> 02:29:55.844]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:29:55.924 --> 02:30:03.412]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:30:04.413 --> 02:30:08.436]  Detoxification integrated with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:30:08.636 --> 02:30:17.643]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[02:30:17.783 --> 02:30:29.732]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life for mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system,
[02:30:29.932 --> 02:30:30.932]  We're good to go.
[02:30:54.893 --> 02:30:57.856]  This is the reality of the crisis in the US economy.
[02:30:57.916 --> 02:31:05.262]  People who used to own their own homes are living hand to mouth on land once occupied by those less fortunate.
[02:31:23.766 --> 02:31:27.147]  In the last month, some 16,000 houses were repossessed.
[02:31:27.608 --> 02:31:32.090]  Their occupants forced out when they could no longer meet ever-increasing mortgage payments.
[02:31:32.690 --> 02:31:36.211]  Now they shower at a local church and get by on handouts.
[02:31:36.912 --> 02:31:40.173]  They have nowhere else to go and it's a difficult adjustment.
[02:31:40.613 --> 02:31:42.894]  But some are determined to get back on track.
[02:31:43.374 --> 02:31:52.038]  Once I do get a job full-time, instead of just one day a week, I'll be able to save my money and get a car and make it easier to go back to work.
[02:31:52.765 --> 02:31:55.907]  This woman used to live in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house.
[02:31:56.368 --> 02:32:00.211]  But when her husband fell ill, it became impossible to make ends meet.
[02:32:00.831 --> 02:32:05.635]  Now they live in a mobile home at the camp, and family visits are a thing of the past.
[02:32:06.315 --> 02:32:07.616]  We have a lot of grandkids, too.
[02:32:09.077 --> 02:32:10.979]  And they always come over and stay and stuff.
[02:32:11.559 --> 02:32:12.140]  They don't come here.
[02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:13.421]  I don't want them to come here.
[02:32:13.581 --> 02:32:15.002]  We go there and see them at their house.
[02:32:16.238 --> 02:32:20.221]  Others, too, are finding it difficult to let go of what they once had.
[02:32:20.241 --> 02:32:25.305]  I lost a home, settled all my bills, sold a prune.
[02:32:25.345 --> 02:32:30.850]  There are clip after clip up on InfoWars.com of these giant tent cities popping up, and you look at it.
[02:32:31.210 --> 02:32:33.492]  It's not the drunken, ne'er-do-well drug addicts.
[02:32:34.073 --> 02:32:39.197]  It's blue-collar people living in tents or mobile homes, and
[02:32:40.029 --> 02:32:47.192]  I notice in the message boards and in the mainstream message where people are like, oh forget them, they're poor, they're scum, they shouldn't have got a loan, they couldn't pay back.
[02:32:47.693 --> 02:32:51.454]  And that's true to a certain extent, but why did the banks give it?
[02:32:52.195 --> 02:32:53.595]  Why do we have to insure it?
[02:32:53.675 --> 02:32:55.156]  Why is the government bailing it out?
[02:32:56.156 --> 02:32:59.878]  You're going to pay taxes on it and you're going to get hit by your savings being devalued.
[02:33:00.679 --> 02:33:05.701]  Then I had a guy yesterday I was talking to go, well I don't care what was happening to the country, I don't own any stocks.
[02:33:06.408 --> 02:33:07.949]  Those companies are imploding.
[02:33:08.289 --> 02:33:09.469]  That affects your business.
[02:33:09.489 --> 02:33:10.629]  That affects where you work.
[02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:20.112]  Bob, what's this attitude of some Americans who laugh at people that are being thrown out of their houses, and who think that this imploding economy isn't going to hurt them?
[02:33:20.773 --> 02:33:26.654]  That seems like such a modern attitude, where these yuppies are trying to just say, so what, that doesn't affect me.
[02:33:26.694 --> 02:33:28.615]  Isn't that the height of decadence?
[02:33:30.156 --> 02:33:31.276]  No, it's the height of ignorance.
[02:33:32.362 --> 02:33:37.585]  And it's the same thing conceptually during the war.
[02:33:38.505 --> 02:33:42.227]  You get four guys in the trench and they think the other guys are going to get it and not you.
[02:33:42.807 --> 02:33:45.269]  And it just isn't that way, as you say.
[02:33:45.669 --> 02:33:47.290]  It affects the entire economy.
[02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:52.012]  And so they should be concerned, but people are ill-educated.
[02:33:52.072 --> 02:33:56.575]  Even people who have business degrees don't know about the things that we talk about.
[02:33:56.675 --> 02:33:58.656]  Or even masters and some with doctorates.
[02:33:59.436 --> 02:34:01.077]  I mean, this is out-of-the-box stuff.
[02:34:01.570 --> 02:34:19.021]  This is stuff that people just don't know and that's why your program and programs like it are so very very important because we're educating people to protect themselves and to care about what goes bankrupt and who loses their job because it affects everybody.
[02:34:21.681 --> 02:34:23.182]  What do we do to protect ourselves?
[02:34:23.522 --> 02:34:25.503]  They're trying to push gold down right now.
[02:34:25.663 --> 02:34:27.404]  Obviously, it's exploding right back up.
[02:34:27.484 --> 02:34:30.725]  Where do you see gold going in the next couple weeks, the next month, the next year?
[02:34:31.185 --> 02:34:32.706]  What other commodities are good, Bob?
[02:34:33.726 --> 02:34:38.929]  Well, $1,600 will be easy this year, and we may see much higher prices.
[02:34:40.609 --> 02:34:45.912]  A minimum of $3,000 on gold and $100 on silver, and we could go much, much higher.
[02:34:45.932 --> 02:34:51.194]  They are going to lose control down the road somewhere between now and three years from now.
[02:34:51.784 --> 02:34:55.085]  And when it happens, hyperinflation will just go crazy.
[02:34:56.065 --> 02:34:59.306]  And, of course, there'll be that stagnation called stagflation.
[02:35:00.186 --> 02:35:02.747]  And it's just an ongoing thing.
[02:35:02.787 --> 02:35:07.568]  You go along and you stay along for the duration of the greatest, biggest bull market in history.
[02:35:10.189 --> 02:35:10.949]  Bob, continue.
[02:35:11.009 --> 02:35:14.030]  Continue with what you think is a safe bet for folks.
[02:35:16.250 --> 02:35:19.151]  Well, the most important thing is gold and silver coins.
[02:35:19.838 --> 02:35:20.719]  And take delivery.
[02:35:20.779 --> 02:35:21.840]  Don't leave them anywhere.
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:23.461]  Take delivery.
[02:35:23.521 --> 02:35:24.221]  Buy a safe.
[02:35:24.241 --> 02:35:25.362]  You can buy a gun safe for $1,500.
[02:35:25.802 --> 02:35:28.985]  And you can put your guns in it as well.
[02:35:29.885 --> 02:35:32.247]  And that's the best line of defense.
[02:35:32.287 --> 02:35:42.315]  The second thing, for those who would like diversification and more speculation, they would buy numismatic coins, and they would also buy shears.
[02:35:42.835 --> 02:35:48.219]  And we recommend different things like that to people, although we don't sell anything to anybody at any time.
[02:35:48.678 --> 02:35:50.719]  Nor do we get paid by anybody to do that.
[02:35:51.379 --> 02:35:53.340]  All we do is have a subscription service.
[02:35:53.861 --> 02:35:56.082]  And incidentally, we answer everybody's questions.
[02:35:57.742 --> 02:36:00.444]  You're amazingly accessible.
[02:36:02.204 --> 02:36:02.925]  In fact, I was bringing that up.
[02:36:02.945 --> 02:36:10.508]  You're amazingly accessible and your info has just been so immaculately accurate, unfortunately, Bob.
[02:36:10.548 --> 02:36:12.009]  I wish we were all wrong about what's happening.
[02:36:12.329 --> 02:36:17.892]  But people can get a free trial subscription to their newsletter at TheInternationalForecaster.com, can't they?
[02:36:19.344 --> 02:36:20.205]  They certainly can.
[02:36:20.485 --> 02:36:22.507]  They can also call a toll-free number.
[02:36:22.547 --> 02:36:23.648]  They can call 800-375-4188.
[02:36:23.708 --> 02:36:27.571]  Give that number again.
[02:36:27.591 --> 02:36:28.952]  800-375-4188.
[02:36:29.032 --> 02:36:36.838]  And this is really, you know, breaking it down stuff, too.
[02:36:36.878 --> 02:36:43.863]  This is full-spectrum analysis, really a lot of key info at theinternationalforecaster.com.
[02:36:43.903 --> 02:36:45.264]  Give that out again, Bob, the phone number.
[02:36:45.284 --> 02:36:45.325]  800-375-4188.
[02:36:50.325 --> 02:36:55.470]  4188.
[02:36:50.726 --> 02:36:55.470]  Now listen, what I want to do is, there's too much to cover today, and I'm about to get into some 9-11 info.
[02:36:55.490 --> 02:37:04.659]  You've agreed to come on in the first hour tomorrow, so at about 8 after, Bob, that's 1108 Central Standard Time.
[02:37:05.299 --> 02:37:08.162]  We've got you on for that hour, into the next hour a little bit.
[02:37:08.522 --> 02:37:14.328]  I want to open the phones up tomorrow so listeners can call in, because they'll bring up issues and angles that I didn't bring up.
[02:37:14.688 --> 02:37:16.328]  So we can really get into this.
[02:37:16.368 --> 02:37:20.269]  We'll also know more about how many companies are going to collapse tomorrow.
[02:37:20.609 --> 02:37:24.530]  But your bottom line is deepening recession for another, what, two years?
[02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:31.732]  And then, what, just open announcement of when the inflation fully comes home to roost, that we're in a depression?
[02:37:32.952 --> 02:37:36.613]  Well, you'll see a non-usage of liquid funds.
[02:37:36.693 --> 02:37:38.773]  In other words, the speculators and
[02:37:39.435 --> 02:37:44.138]  And companies will no longer be using the funds available.
[02:37:44.158 --> 02:37:48.561]  And when that happens, the Fed loses total control.
[02:37:49.242 --> 02:37:54.065]  And that's when you want to be out of everything except gold bullion coins.
[02:37:54.925 --> 02:37:56.887]  And then you take them for the last ride.
[02:37:57.647 --> 02:38:05.793]  They'll probably retain 80% of their value, whereas everything else, if the last depression is any indicator, everything else will drop from 60 to 90%.
[02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:09.280]  Good God!
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:11.321]  And a lot of people think $1,000 is the top.
[02:38:11.902 --> 02:38:14.343]  You're saying, conservatively, year-end, $1,600?
[02:38:14.903 --> 02:38:18.685]  Yeah, conservatively.
[02:38:18.705 --> 02:38:27.930]  And I believe that we could see much higher prices than that, because they're going to lose control of the manipulation of the markets, the gold and silver suppression.
[02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:33.273]  They're going to lose control of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P.
[02:38:33.313 --> 02:38:34.974]  The S&Ps have already broken down.
[02:38:34.994 --> 02:38:35.754]  All right.
[02:38:36.014 --> 02:38:37.455]  We'll talk to you in the first...
[02:38:39.042 --> 02:38:39.362]  Go ahead.
[02:38:40.643 --> 02:38:41.603]  No, that's OK.
[02:38:42.464 --> 02:38:44.345]  No, you were finishing up, but they've already lost control.
[02:38:44.365 --> 02:38:44.725]  Go ahead.
[02:38:46.306 --> 02:38:48.788]  Yes, and the S&Ps have already broken down.
[02:38:50.048 --> 02:38:52.810]  And so it's just a question of when is this thing going down.
[02:38:52.850 --> 02:38:53.370]  Where's it going?
[02:38:53.850 --> 02:38:54.971]  I would say 10,300 on the Dow.
[02:38:55.071 --> 02:38:57.993]  And eventually next year, probably down to 7,268.
[02:39:07.663 --> 02:39:24.491]  Which was the low during 2001, and that means that all the investments of pension funds will drop probably about 40 or 50 percent, and it's going to create a lot of problems throughout the world because all the other markets will go down.
[02:39:25.372 --> 02:39:30.594]  We're not going to be the only ones, even though it was caused in America, that are going to suffer from all of this.
[02:39:31.094 --> 02:39:31.755]  Absolutely.
[02:39:31.855 --> 02:39:32.975]  Thank you for joining us, Bob.
[02:39:32.995 --> 02:39:34.456]  We'll talk to you in the first hour tomorrow.
[02:39:35.595 --> 02:39:36.215]  Okay, bye-bye.
[02:39:36.715 --> 02:39:41.156]  TheInternationalForecaster.com, because we can't cover it all in just 30 minutes with him.
[02:39:41.997 --> 02:39:44.157]  I'm racing here because I want to bring Luke Rudowsky up.
[02:39:44.237 --> 02:39:49.359]  Bo Diehl, the big, famous New York detective, and the head of the police union, and the rest of it.
[02:39:50.139 --> 02:39:53.720]  They confronted him, and he just started saying, yeah, my daughter thinks it's an inside job.
[02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:55.200]  Why were there no body parts?
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:57.201]  Why was it all turned to dust?
[02:39:57.221 --> 02:40:00.161]  But then he counters with, but they were hollow inside.
[02:40:00.201 --> 02:40:02.462]  No, the buildings had 47 giant steel columns.
[02:40:03.118 --> 02:40:04.759]  So Deedle says he has questions.
[02:40:05.319 --> 02:40:06.220]  This is big news.
[02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:07.580]  He's a Fox News contributor.
[02:40:08.140 --> 02:40:10.662]  Before we do that, I'm just going to plug this one more time briefly.
[02:40:11.862 --> 02:40:32.272]  Ted Anderson at the $1,000 an ounce level, and it's gone well above that to date at $1,030 an ounce, has a limited-time offer of British Sovereign Gold coins at $2.77 apiece, Franks at $2.20, Walking Liberty Halves at $2.10 per roll, and that comes out to basically silver spot.
[02:40:33.664 --> 02:40:35.726]  So give the folks a call at 800-686-2237.
[02:40:35.766 --> 02:40:37.689]  I think that Bob and others are being too conservative.
[02:40:51.564 --> 02:40:53.847]  It could be by next year we could go into a depression.
[02:40:53.907 --> 02:40:55.850]  I mean, this is happening too fast, but whatever.
[02:40:55.970 --> 02:40:59.576]  I hope none of it happens, but there's no way it's not going to happen in the next three.
[02:40:59.656 --> 02:41:04.484]  So I just, of course, they'll probably say blood in the streets and people starving to death is in a depression too.
[02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:10.493]  Play clips of me saying this later, but just 800-686-2237.
[02:41:10.953 --> 02:41:14.335]  Get into Precious Metals, 800-686-2237.
[02:41:16.296 --> 02:41:17.276]  Going to Luke Rudowsky.
[02:41:17.356 --> 02:41:18.957]  We're just almost out of time here.
[02:41:19.277 --> 02:41:21.258]  Luke, introduce, first I want to commend you.
[02:41:21.278 --> 02:41:23.219]  You guys are on fire at WeAreChange.org.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.382]  Mo Deedle, tell folks about the audio they're about to hear.
[02:41:27.642 --> 02:41:28.162]  Luke Rudowski.
[02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:30.582]  Poe Diggle is a Fox News pundit.
[02:41:30.642 --> 02:41:39.010]  He's been doing a lot of talking against Not 11 Truth, but we were able to confront him in the streets of New York City, where actually he came out, and we actually agree on more than we usually thought.
[02:41:39.370 --> 02:41:42.754]  And God bless his daughter for talking to him about Not 11 Truth.
[02:41:44.615 --> 02:41:45.756]  Tell folks where this happened.
[02:41:46.397 --> 02:41:48.019]  Oh, this happened at the John McCain event.
[02:41:48.039 --> 02:41:48.679]  This was March 11th.
[02:41:48.719 --> 02:41:50.181]  We were doing actions on John.
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:59.904]  On March 11th, we actually got to confront John McCain, Carl Cameron, Senator Graham, and one of those other conversations was Bo Diegel, and we talked to him on the way coming in.
[02:42:00.224 --> 02:42:04.686]  He came out, started calling us anarchists, and then he started talking to us, and we had a great conversation with him.
[02:42:04.866 --> 02:42:12.829]  And for those that don't know, he was one of the guys on stage with Geraldo when they ordered us arrested for standing on the sidewalk protesting in New York.
[02:42:13.953 --> 02:42:18.900]  Uh, and, uh, you know, he's gone on TV and attacked us, but now, now we had to cut a lot of cuss words out.
[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:21.805]  This guy, just, he's like out of The Sopranos or something.
[02:42:22.426 --> 02:42:23.907]  We're going to play a few minutes of this.
[02:42:23.927 --> 02:42:31.033]  There's more of it at WeAreChange.org and an article that Curt Nemo wrote, or I guess Paul Watson wrote, at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:42:31.654 --> 02:42:37.158]  But here it is, as he's double-thinking, saying, yeah, no body parts, blown into tiny little pieces.
[02:42:37.699 --> 02:42:40.201]  You know, he was told Building 7 was going to be brought down.
[02:42:40.221 --> 02:42:42.563]  I mean, this is incredible admissions.
[02:42:43.443 --> 02:42:44.745]  They tell him about the countdown.
[02:42:44.805 --> 02:42:46.006]  He says, yeah, I know.
[02:42:46.026 --> 02:42:48.368]  Well, I mean, hell, right there, the countdown.
[02:42:48.408 --> 02:42:48.768]  Here it is.
[02:42:49.961 --> 02:42:51.021]  We're not anarchists.
[02:42:51.041 --> 02:42:51.922]  We're American citizens.
[02:42:51.942 --> 02:42:53.362]  We're family members.
[02:42:53.402 --> 02:42:55.163]  You remember the movie One Tough Job?
[02:42:55.183 --> 02:42:56.743]  You remember the movie?
[02:42:56.864 --> 02:42:57.424]  Yeah.
[02:42:57.524 --> 02:42:59.144]  I should knock out ten guys.
[02:42:59.825 --> 02:43:00.485]  One by one.
[02:43:00.525 --> 02:43:01.665]  So who wants to go first?
[02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:04.806]  You want to knock us out?
[02:43:04.826 --> 02:43:06.867]  You want to debate?
[02:43:06.967 --> 02:43:09.208]  All I say is kids, listen to me.
[02:43:09.288 --> 02:43:10.528]  I like these young jocks.
[02:43:10.588 --> 02:43:11.489]  Listen.
[02:43:11.549 --> 02:43:12.389]  Shoot to the memories.
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:14.784]  Whatever feeling you have, I respect that.
[02:43:14.844 --> 02:43:17.650]  Right before I went to college, she said, Dad, I'm doing a paper.
[02:43:17.690 --> 02:43:19.033]  It was a conspiracy.
[02:43:19.313 --> 02:43:20.095]  But what do you feel?
[02:43:20.135 --> 02:43:21.899]  I respect everyone's feelings on everything.
[02:43:22.623 --> 02:43:26.246]  The fact of the matter is they had five to six inch floorings.
[02:43:26.646 --> 02:43:32.610]  They wanted aesthetic views of full trading floors without any kind of support in the center.
[02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:37.773]  The columns on the outside, when it was built, it was built with columns about two foot wide on the outside.
[02:43:38.173 --> 02:43:41.896]  The weight of these friggin' columns was so heavy on those floors.
[02:43:42.056 --> 02:43:46.999]  It was never built for... It was never built to go down like that.
[02:43:47.039 --> 02:43:48.180]  And that's a friggin' lie.
[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:49.181]  Anybody says that.
[02:43:49.601 --> 02:43:52.223]  All I'm saying is the construction of that building
[02:43:52.903 --> 02:43:53.224]  Sucked!
[02:43:53.584 --> 02:43:57.647]  And they never dropped in a million years that the tragedy that happened.
[02:43:57.747 --> 02:44:01.770]  What happened at World Trade Center Building 7?
[02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:03.071]  Where we have firefighters?
[02:44:03.191 --> 02:44:04.272]  I was there that afternoon.
[02:44:04.312 --> 02:44:05.753]  Okay, so let me tell you what happens now.
[02:44:05.833 --> 02:44:06.714]  The pillars come down.
[02:44:06.774 --> 02:44:07.595]  I'm in my office.
[02:44:07.615 --> 02:44:07.735]  Yeah.
[02:44:07.975 --> 02:44:10.616]  We shoot down there because they said people are trapped there and all that.
[02:44:10.636 --> 02:44:10.896]  They were.
[02:44:10.916 --> 02:44:12.836]  So we want to help cops, firemen, and all that.
[02:44:13.116 --> 02:44:13.816]  So I had a suit on.
[02:44:13.876 --> 02:44:15.497]  I go to the Army, Navy, started to put boots on.
[02:44:15.557 --> 02:44:16.737]  I put dungarees and sweatshirts on.
[02:44:17.057 --> 02:44:17.917]  We shoot down there.
[02:44:18.338 --> 02:44:20.718]  All of a sudden, it's about 3, 3 in the afternoon.
[02:44:21.138 --> 02:44:23.039]  Now, they're starting to say, get away.
[02:44:23.319 --> 02:44:24.659]  Number 7 is going to come down.
[02:44:24.679 --> 02:44:25.899]  You got to understand something.
[02:44:26.039 --> 02:44:30.841]  When they go down these buildings, I said, where the hell did these buildings go?
[02:44:31.121 --> 02:44:34.962]  You're talking about 110-story buildings that have been evaporated.
[02:44:35.082 --> 02:44:36.202]  Where are the people?
[02:44:38.587 --> 02:44:41.735]  I respect everybody here, because I ask the same questions.
[02:44:41.835 --> 02:44:43.359]  It's such a devastating thing.
[02:44:43.379 --> 02:44:44.943]  I have four children.
[02:44:46.130 --> 02:44:47.010]  I've lost friends.
[02:44:47.651 --> 02:44:50.712]  John, my friend from the FBI was killed.
[02:44:50.732 --> 02:44:51.872]  John O'Neill.
[02:44:52.312 --> 02:44:53.753]  We lost a lot of family members.
[02:44:54.333 --> 02:44:57.754]  I just wish to God that it wasn't what it was.
[02:44:58.874 --> 02:45:01.615]  I had my daughter and my children up there three weeks before the building.
[02:45:01.635 --> 02:45:03.136]  My daughter said, Dad, we don't belong here.
[02:45:03.156 --> 02:45:03.696]  Something scary.
[02:45:03.716 --> 02:45:04.256]  She was crying.
[02:45:04.276 --> 02:45:05.336]  She wouldn't get out of the elevator.
[02:45:05.636 --> 02:45:11.098]  And then when I went down there, I stayed there until 6 o'clock in the morning trying to help people.
[02:45:11.138 --> 02:45:12.158]  There was nothing left.
[02:45:12.238 --> 02:45:13.439]  Everything was pulverized.
[02:45:14.179 --> 02:45:14.619]  Whatever.
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:19.863]  If we blew it up, if the government blew it up, where the f*** did all these bodies go?
[02:45:20.163 --> 02:45:21.404]  It was polarized.
[02:45:21.644 --> 02:45:23.365]  And to me, that was... And you know what?
[02:45:23.445 --> 02:45:25.866]  No bones, no DNA were found.
[02:45:26.667 --> 02:45:29.329]  It's just something that you say, well, where's the body parts?
[02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:30.789]  I didn't see no body parts.
[02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:35.672]  I got there around 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:37.534]  All I'm saying is this.
[02:45:38.534 --> 02:45:42.817]  If there's a conspiracy theory... Oh, I do agree with you on one thing.
[02:45:43.638 --> 02:45:47.962]  Bush and Clinton with their relationship with Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:48.022 --> 02:45:48.743]  I agree with you.
[02:45:48.763 --> 02:45:50.424]  They're kissing their asses like that.
[02:45:50.444 --> 02:45:55.670]  Because they're sucked up and that family that took off, that's a crime.
[02:45:56.991 --> 02:45:58.913]  We all agree on something, okay?
[02:45:58.933 --> 02:46:00.795]  But my problem with this whole thing is
[02:46:01.778 --> 02:46:02.278]  I was there.
[02:46:02.339 --> 02:46:04.680]  I can't understand where bodies went to.
[02:46:04.700 --> 02:46:05.421]  Me too.
[02:46:05.901 --> 02:46:07.442]  I can understand that.
[02:46:07.462 --> 02:46:09.384]  Forty-five percent of the people there are missing.
[02:46:09.624 --> 02:46:10.344]  But let me tell you this.
[02:46:10.444 --> 02:46:11.865]  I know many people who are affected as well.
[02:46:12.005 --> 02:46:14.947]  One of them is Kevin McPadden, an Air Force medic who came down to help.
[02:46:15.248 --> 02:46:20.151]  And he said he heard the countdown to Building 7 from 10 all the way to zero before they took that building down.
[02:46:20.171 --> 02:46:21.472]  Now, can I just say one thing?
[02:46:21.652 --> 02:46:25.835]  When the first plane hit, I was on the bridge going to the Viaduct to my office.
[02:46:25.855 --> 02:46:26.896]  I was in Daly Newsville.
[02:46:27.276 --> 02:46:28.397]  I got out of my car.
[02:46:28.497 --> 02:46:30.057]  I saw the second explosion.
[02:46:30.077 --> 02:46:32.018]  I didn't actually see the point because I was too far away.
[02:46:32.318 --> 02:46:35.040]  The explosion was the size of the building in the center of the building.
[02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:35.900]  The second explosion.
[02:46:36.380 --> 02:46:37.381]  Now, I rushed through.
[02:46:37.401 --> 02:46:38.381]  They closed the Midtown Tunnel.
[02:46:38.421 --> 02:46:39.201]  I show my badge.
[02:46:39.401 --> 02:46:40.002]  I shoot through.
[02:46:40.282 --> 02:46:41.262]  I'm in my offices.
[02:46:41.342 --> 02:46:42.603]  All of a sudden, now, we're watching.
[02:46:42.643 --> 02:46:44.103]  I have a perfect view down there.
[02:46:44.484 --> 02:46:46.465]  And people start to scream.
[02:46:46.505 --> 02:46:47.305]  Now, they're on fire.
[02:46:47.865 --> 02:46:49.066]  We're saying, should we go down there?
[02:46:49.126 --> 02:46:50.187]  People are trapped and all that.
[02:46:50.567 --> 02:46:53.450]  We didn't go down there immediately at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:55.391]  Next thing I hear scream, I looked up.
[02:46:55.812 --> 02:46:57.733]  And when these are coming down, you know what the first thing I said?
[02:46:58.033 --> 02:47:01.916]  They have bombs in those buildings.
[02:47:01.976 --> 02:47:03.738]  I'm telling you what was in my mind.
[02:47:03.758 --> 02:47:06.000]  I said, no way there had to be bombs in the building.
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:08.722]  But the problem that I have with this whole thing is,
[02:47:09.555 --> 02:47:12.538]  No, the two-plane did go into those buildings.
[02:47:12.578 --> 02:47:14.099]  We all agree with that.
[02:47:14.779 --> 02:47:23.427]  And when the way those buildings came down, but if you understand the science of the thick steel on the outside, these floors had these things called salamanders in it.
[02:47:23.487 --> 02:47:28.030]  With five to six inches of concrete, that's all they had in the middle of that building to support.
[02:47:28.050 --> 02:47:29.852]  I want to come back and finish with Luke.
[02:47:29.912 --> 02:47:30.552]  It goes on and on.
[02:47:30.572 --> 02:47:32.614]  He talks about how his daughter thinks it's an inside job.
[02:47:33.074 --> 02:47:34.856]  Brought him movies, brought him documents.
[02:47:34.896 --> 02:47:35.997]  He's got questions now.
[02:47:36.676 --> 02:47:39.117]  And he said, I don't know if the government effing blew it up.
[02:47:39.517 --> 02:47:41.818]  All I know is those people were pulverized.
[02:47:42.338 --> 02:47:43.159]  So I understand.
[02:47:43.179 --> 02:47:44.619]  I have the same feelings you do.
[02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:52.023]  And this is the head of the police union, the head of, you know, just everything.
[02:47:52.043 --> 02:47:55.944]  I mean, the guy's the big, you know, top cop in New York, basically.
[02:47:57.005 --> 02:48:04.408]  And here he is with two gigantic, guys are like seven feet tall, about to weigh 400 pound bodyguards with him.
[02:48:05.296 --> 02:48:11.661]  Here comes Deedle up to a bunch of people, you know, average 25 years of age, going, hey, Anarchist, who do you want me to knock out first?
[02:48:14.183 --> 02:48:20.607]  And I remember making eye contact with Deedle, and he was yelling at me, laughing at me, and I just told him, you know what, we know you're involved in the attack, and you cover it up.
[02:48:20.948 --> 02:48:25.591]  Then he kind of acted all weird when I was confronting him down in New York.
[02:48:26.011 --> 02:48:28.233]  But the point is, this time he just started spilling his guts.
[02:48:29.515 --> 02:48:32.296]  None of us are safe while these killers are operating.
[02:48:32.656 --> 02:48:37.478]  And good for Bo Deedle that he finally woke up and talked and basically spilt his guts.
[02:48:38.499 --> 02:48:40.119]  Gotta be bothering you, Bo, doesn't it?
[02:48:40.659 --> 02:48:41.400]  You know the truth.
[02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:42.220]  You know what happened.
[02:48:42.440 --> 02:48:43.741]  Why don't you come out all the way?
[02:48:46.382 --> 02:48:47.802]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.863 --> 02:48:49.903]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.623 --> 02:48:54.805]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power called God.
[02:48:55.524 --> 02:48:57.926]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:58.326 --> 02:49:00.468]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.128 --> 02:49:03.570]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.311 --> 02:49:11.677]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.659 --> 02:49:19.643]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.083 --> 02:49:23.386]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.966 --> 02:49:26.469]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.529 --> 02:49:27.670]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:28.451]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.471 --> 02:49:29.532]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.752 --> 02:49:30.513]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.733 --> 02:49:31.534]  That's what they're after.

[02:49:43.406 --> 02:49:44.547]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.467 --> 02:49:50.492]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.
[02:49:50.812 --> 02:49:57.018]  Our goal is to get these fine hemp products to you in the least amount of time so you can enjoy what the powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[02:49:57.258 --> 02:49:59.720]  HempUSA.org has a warning that the U.S.
[02:49:59.760 --> 02:50:04.925]  food supplies are dangerously low and we urge you to protect your family with hemp storable foods today.
[02:50:05.085 --> 02:50:06.346]  Tomorrow may be too late.
[02:50:06.506 --> 02:50:06.767]  Call 908-325-7000.
[02:50:07.447 --> 02:50:07.948]  I think so.
[02:50:37.210 --> 02:50:39.451]  This product is also great for pets and animals.
[02:50:39.612 --> 02:50:44.635]  Call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[02:50:45.275 --> 02:50:45.936]  It's a fact.
[02:50:46.156 --> 02:50:53.641]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:50:53.741 --> 02:51:02.587]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:51:02.867 --> 02:51:13.432]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:51:13.672 --> 02:51:19.675]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:51:19.815 --> 02:51:20.375]  Well, you were sleeping
[02:51:50.166 --> 02:51:51.707]  They came and took it all away!
[02:51:51.727 --> 02:52:07.135]  I think the unraveling's happening faster than we thought.
[02:52:07.215 --> 02:52:11.998]  Argentina, Brazil... to drop U.S.
[02:52:12.078 --> 02:52:16.280]  dollar... in bilateral commercial transactions.
[02:52:17.161 --> 02:52:19.182]  But the 7-Is is coming in every day.
[02:52:23.115 --> 02:52:28.117]  You know, I just want to get Luke on for a full hour to really get into what We Are Change is doing.
[02:52:28.137 --> 02:52:28.997]  WeAreChange.org.
[02:52:29.017 --> 02:52:31.778]  We're about to go back to him and finish up with this Bo Dietl situation.
[02:52:32.158 --> 02:52:39.041]  Before I do that, you know, one of the biggest, most successful vitamin and mineral supplement companies out there is New Vitality.
[02:52:39.061 --> 02:52:40.241]  We're proud to have them as sponsors.
[02:52:41.192 --> 02:52:41.592]  We're good to go!
[02:53:06.289 --> 02:53:14.191]  And these are well-documented herbs that are just so good for your overall health of your prostate and all the things that it's connected to.
[02:53:14.211 --> 02:53:14.752]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:53:14.772 --> 02:53:14.832]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:53:14.852 --> 02:53:16.732]  You can also get the Aloe Ease Body Cleanse by calling 1-800-569-4056.
[02:53:16.772 --> 02:53:17.832]  Take action, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:18.193 --> 02:53:19.033]  Give them a call.
[02:53:19.113 --> 02:53:21.053]  Your health is worth it.
[02:53:21.073 --> 02:53:21.133]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:53:21.153 --> 02:53:22.454]  Going back to Luke Rodowski.
[02:53:34.938 --> 02:53:37.320]  Luke, in closing, I appreciate you coming on on such short notice.
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:38.000]  Just good job!
[02:53:39.402 --> 02:53:42.544]  I want to get you back up sometime this week when we're ready to talk about it.
[02:53:42.624 --> 02:53:48.168]  I don't know how much you want to get into, but we know they're trying to set us up for the bombing in Times Square.
[02:53:48.629 --> 02:53:51.951]  We knew they were pre-setting us up beforehand because they're scared we're going to expose them.
[02:53:52.352 --> 02:53:57.516]  They better be scared because the people that are defending the system are now complicit with the murders on 9-11.
[02:53:58.777 --> 02:54:02.840]  But you had somebody we know as an operative show up last weekend, physically assault one of the guys,
[02:54:04.012 --> 02:54:12.375]  You got it all on video and holding up a sign saying that 9-11 Truth, We Are Change was behind the attacks, the attack in Times Square.
[02:54:13.536 --> 02:54:17.337]  And of course, national, international media just happened to show up right when that happened.
[02:54:17.798 --> 02:54:20.799]  So you guys are under serious operations right now.
[02:54:21.579 --> 02:54:23.420]  And so we're just all praying for you, Luke.
[02:54:24.005 --> 02:54:33.570]  Not only that, but from Geraldo and even other Not 11 Troops websites, but one thing I just wanted to say that these attacks and these distractions won't ever stop us from fighting for those people who are affected by Not 11.
[02:54:34.131 --> 02:54:36.952]  This will only embolden us and make us fight stronger.
[02:54:36.992 --> 02:54:37.873]  We will never stop.
[02:54:37.893 --> 02:54:45.617]  Well, the ridiculous thing is they're mainly targeting you because you started it all, but it's an idea of liberty.
[02:54:45.637 --> 02:54:46.298]  You can't kill it.
[02:54:46.338 --> 02:54:47.318]  It's spreading everywhere.
[02:54:47.338 --> 02:54:48.699]  What is it, 60-something chapters now?
[02:54:49.409 --> 02:54:52.671]  We're unstoppable, and what's great about We Are Change is there's not one leader.
[02:54:52.691 --> 02:54:54.353]  The leader is an idea.
[02:54:54.453 --> 02:54:55.113]  It's a spirit.
[02:54:55.353 --> 02:54:59.196]  It's a spirit of change, and this change cannot be stopped, and it's going worldwide.
[02:54:59.236 --> 02:55:07.722]  We have chapters internationally, all throughout the United States, and wherever these criminal politicians, wherever these criminal politocrats go, we're going to be there.
[02:55:07.742 --> 02:55:08.503]  We're going to confront them.
[02:55:08.523 --> 02:55:09.644]  We're going to speak truth to power.
[02:55:10.279 --> 02:55:13.840]  Well, we know the Feds are running the no-plane thing, saying no planes set to discredit us.
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:14.840]  We know their operatives are.
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:23.043]  But to have one of their operatives show up, assault somebody, and hold up a sign saying 9-11 Truth, you know, did the attack in Times Square.
[02:55:23.063 --> 02:55:24.524]  I mean, that's so obvious.
[02:55:24.884 --> 02:55:26.304]  They're getting so desperate.
[02:55:26.324 --> 02:55:29.685]  And when you didn't attack back, that sent them into a red rage.
[02:55:30.165 --> 02:55:32.526]  They are going to lose, and I hope they know that.
[02:55:32.806 --> 02:55:33.626]  God bless you, Luke.
[02:55:33.646 --> 02:55:34.167]  Great job.
[02:55:34.487 --> 02:55:35.127]  Thanks for having me.
[02:55:35.607 --> 02:55:35.947]  You bet.
[02:55:36.447 --> 02:55:38.548]  Folks, I've been plugging this hard lately because
[02:55:39.509 --> 02:55:41.931]  Once it starts going up, it's not going to stop.
[02:55:42.471 --> 02:55:47.754]  I want you again to call right now and get into silver at spot folks.
[02:55:49.555 --> 02:55:53.378]  They've got a $210 per roll of silver coins.
[02:55:54.278 --> 02:55:54.939]  They've got British
[02:55:56.474 --> 02:55:59.336]  Sovereign gold coins at $2.77 apiece.
[02:55:59.856 --> 02:56:01.517]  European francs at $2.20 apiece.
[02:56:01.577 --> 02:56:02.678]  Give them a call today.
[02:56:02.698 --> 02:56:03.278]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:56:03.338 --> 02:56:07.801]  I tend to hold all the plugs to the end.
[02:56:07.821 --> 02:56:10.002]  I appreciate folks supporting all our sponsors.
[02:56:10.483 --> 02:56:11.763]  But I'm telling you, this is a great deal.
[02:56:11.783 --> 02:56:12.364]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:56:14.845 --> 02:56:17.167]  If you missed the first hour, it was from Tibet.
[02:56:17.607 --> 02:56:18.407]  Jam-packed.
[02:56:18.988 --> 02:56:21.569]  It's restarting right now at InfoWars.com at the screens.
[02:56:21.589 --> 02:56:23.510]  But you've got to go to InfoWars.com.
