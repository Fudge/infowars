[00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:06.305]  There's too much confusion.
[00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:12.894]  I can't get no relief.
[00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:16.059]  Fit this man to drink my wine.
[00:00:28.248 --> 00:00:37.176]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv, live streaming video from in studio not just on a growing wonderful list of Eminem affiliates across the country.
[00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:38.938]  Global shortwave on WWCR.
[00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.845]  Number one radio talk show on shoutcast anywhere on the web.
[00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.612]  Hundreds of thousands listening on the different systems right now on the internet as well.
[00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:54.300]  83,000 a day on average now downloading the free podcast at infowars.com.
[00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:56.497]  And I'm not tooting our horn.
[00:00:56.537 --> 00:01:08.746]  I'm letting people realize with just this one radio show and others out there and other websites and other great people, we are carrying the message of truth to the people and they're listening like never before.
[00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:12.749]  Ron Paul coming up sometime in the next hour and a half for a quick interview.
[00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:18.112]  We have Congressman Brad Sherman who was told this has to be passed, or martial law.
[00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:24.336]  Not martial law with the House rules, like we heard from a congressman from North Texas, Burgess, on Monday.
[00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:25.756]  National martial law.
[00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:34.862]  NORTHCOM announcing they are going to use TRIPS domestically, activated brigades, not just one, but multiple brigades, for continutive government, for civil unrest.
[00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:38.099]  This is the takeover.
[00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.700]  You're seeing what happened in Nazi Germany.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.961]  You're seeing what happened in Russia.
[00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.662]  You're seeing what happened with Pol Pot.
[00:01:42.722 --> 00:01:43.722]  I mean, this is it.
[00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:45.143]  We have to get the word out.
[00:01:45.183 --> 00:01:46.103]  We have to say no.
[00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:47.264]  We have to stop them.
[00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:48.365]  They engineered all this.
[00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:56.769]  And a man who valiantly exposed this over a year ago is Congressman Dan Hamburg.
[00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:23.695]  uh... from northern california federal congressman uh... several terms uh... now out of the uh... congress and he wrote a detailed report that we have a link to in the story that kurt nimmo wrote about this on info wars dot com read it carefully this is a san francisco chronicle picked up by other newspapers across the world because he's highly respected and uh... he started out with this quote rule by fear or rule by law
[00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:38.507]  The power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to law, and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers, is the highest degree of odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian governments, whether Nazi or Communist.
[00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:40.530]  Winston Churchill, November 21st, 1943.
[00:02:43.937 --> 00:03:04.408]  And then he goes through the systematic takeover, PDD 51, John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the Military Commissions Act, and then you've got all these covert operations of military buying off mayors and police chiefs that we've interviewed and brought on air about Delta Force and CIA showing up with bags of money saying, just be friends with us with what's coming.
[00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:12.572]  Governor Ventura, first day, this is years ago, as a governor, is called down to the basement, 23 CIA agents, not telling him who their names are.
[00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.755]  Black Ops are all around us, folks.
[00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.397]  This is the military-industrial complex.
[00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:31.450]  Just like in third world countries, the juntas, where the military takes over, or Roman Caesars being overthrown on a monthly basis in the deep decline before the sack in 410 by Alaric, overthrows every month by the generals.
[00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:32.752]  I mean, this is what
[00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:40.342]  Caesar did 2040-something years ago when he passed the Rubicon and brought his troops into Rome.
[00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:42.943]  Of course, that river in the north up by Austria.
[00:03:43.343 --> 00:03:44.824]  That's what it means to cross the Rubicon.
[00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:46.925]  So I've given you some background here.
[00:03:47.285 --> 00:03:48.646]  This is really happening!
[00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:52.107]  And it's being done, not in slow motion, but in medium motion.
[00:03:52.547 --> 00:03:53.448]  We can't accept it.
[00:03:53.488 --> 00:03:54.448]  We can't go along with it.
[00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:59.110]  To recap, 35 minutes ago, no, exactly 37 minutes ago, the house passed.
[00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:10.176]  Under threat of economic terrorism, where the Plunge Protection Team didn't bail out the stock market as they do daily.
[00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:14.342]  And so it plunged $1,200,000,000 plus in one day on Monday.
[00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:15.704]  That terrorizing didn't work.
[00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:18.547]  Still 90-plus percent against the Banker Empowerment Bill.
[00:04:20.506 --> 00:04:21.747]  The economic takeover bill.
[00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:23.148]  We're going to the Congressman here in just a moment.
[00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:24.209]  I want to recap all this.
[00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.089]  This is historic.
[00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:27.791]  I want to get his take on it and how we stop it and turn it around.
[00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:32.354]  And then they told Congress, they said, you pass this or physical martial law will come.
[00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:36.577]  They were told this last night and today and the House passed it under duress.
[00:04:37.298 --> 00:04:38.979]  This ties into everything we've seen.
[00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:42.622]  The clearly launched White House anthrax attacks on Congress.
[00:04:43.402 --> 00:04:44.283]  Folks, my life's in danger.
[00:04:44.323 --> 00:04:45.644]  I'm getting death threats every day now.
[00:04:45.724 --> 00:04:46.305]  Other people are.
[00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:47.806]  This is happening.
[00:04:47.827 --> 00:04:48.367]  You understand?
[00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:49.728]  This is red level.
[00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.830]  America is being taken over.
[00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.252]  We've got to say no now.
[00:04:53.612 --> 00:04:57.056]  The good news is 90 plus percent are against it and are hopping mad now.
[00:04:57.316 --> 00:04:58.958]  So this government's totally illegitimate.
[00:04:59.178 --> 00:05:00.379]  This vote is illegitimate.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.281]  And this is just so amazing.
[00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:04.683]  And now they've got martial law economic powers.
[00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:07.906]  It's right there in the bill in the subsections for the private bankers.
[00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:09.387]  It only protects them, not the people.
[00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:17.231]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, who warned us again in February of last year, more than a year ago, rule by fear, rule by law.
[00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:19.813]  It's happening, sir.
[00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:20.854]  It could get a lot worse.
[00:05:21.914 --> 00:05:25.317]  Break down what it's like to see this happening and go through the points.
[00:05:26.998 --> 00:05:33.862]  Well, you know, this is not something that really should surprise people, but I think the heartening thing is that
[00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:42.730]  The calls that were going into congressional offices were anywhere from 50 to 100 to 1 against this.
[00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:55.198]  So I think it's clear that people are finally waking up to the loss of the Constitution, the loss of sovereignty, and also the way this government has set things up
[00:05:56.147 --> 00:06:02.130]  In the way they have in order to systematically tank the economy.
[00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:08.694]  Now, the thing that I'm looking at now, we've got 30 days until a presidential election.
[00:06:09.775 --> 00:06:12.016]  What will happen in those 30 days?
[00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:22.342]  And is the current cabal that's in charge, is the neocon cabal, willing to take the risk of turning this over?
[00:06:23.455 --> 00:06:25.056]  You know, to the Democratic Party.
[00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:29.839]  I mean, we know the Democratic Party is not significantly different from the Republicans.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:39.545]  But still, I have to wonder if there is another surprise in store for us in the month of October besides this.
[00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:49.892]  It's not clear at all that the markets are going to be responsive to this because the underlying economy is what is, you know, what is messed up in this country.
[00:06:49.912 --> 00:06:51.473]  You know, it's the foreclosures.
[00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:54.559]  It's the loss of employment.
[00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:57.801]  It's the fact that the infrastructure of the country is crumbling.
[00:06:57.841 --> 00:06:59.422]  The educational system is crumbling.
[00:06:59.462 --> 00:07:00.942]  The healthcare system is crumbling.
[00:07:01.543 --> 00:07:12.109]  So whether this bailout, it's certainly going to be good for investment bankers and for the confidence on Wall Street in the short term.
[00:07:12.549 --> 00:07:19.874]  But I'm not at all sure that we're not going to see another big surprise in the next month.
[00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:33.642]  And one of those possible surprises, I think, is kind of a Hail Mary pass kind of thing from Cheney and his group inside the administration.
[00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:40.224]  I think back to what happened with the missing nukes from the Air Force Base in North Dakota.
[00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:43.966]  I think to the assassination in Houston.
[00:07:44.585 --> 00:07:44.825]  I don't
[00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:10.484]  Uncertain of everything that's going on and you know I think about Naomi Klein and her shock doctrine theory.
[00:08:10.964 --> 00:08:27.891]  I think people are in shock right now and that this is the time that people like Cheney most take advantage of that shock to manipulate public opinion and to do what they want to do and to pursue their globalist
[00:08:29.565 --> 00:08:35.370]  You know, a gender which is way beyond anything that the American people would normally tolerate.
[00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:37.471]  Absolutely.
[00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:44.056]  We're seeing things happen on a daily basis that would have shaken the political system to its core just a decade ago.
[00:08:44.116 --> 00:08:57.847]  I mean, from torturing children in front of their parents, to domestic spying on the American people, to the military spying on peace groups, to FEMA camps, to being built openly and being in the newspaper, to just absolute
[00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:02.999]  Crazy corruption, but the good news is it did come out with Cy Hirsch.
[00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:08.864]  It did come out on MSNBC that Cheney just three months ago was planning to paint up U.S.
[00:09:08.904 --> 00:09:14.509]  Navy patrol boats like Iranian boats and have Navy SEALs launch sneak attacks on larger U.S.
[00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:15.330]  ships in the
[00:09:16.331 --> 00:09:18.534]  And also understanding, Alex, that false flag terrorism is nothing new.
[00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:53.372]  I'm looking back to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and I'm looking back to, you know, the Kennedy assassination and, you know, things start to fall into place and it's like the scales begin to fall from the eyes and people go, aha, this is the kind of country I've been living in all these years.
[00:09:53.932 --> 00:09:59.614]  And what has this propaganda that's been put out by the elites been all about?
[00:09:59.854 --> 00:10:02.835]  And, you know, that is a very encouraging thing.
[00:10:03.297 --> 00:10:15.683]  But, one of the problems, and we know it's one of the big problems, and programs like yours battle against that problem, which is that people still mostly get garbage information from the mainstream media.
[00:10:15.703 --> 00:10:18.044]  Or they get sucked into it.
[00:10:18.104 --> 00:10:19.084]  Corporate control.
[00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:26.808]  And what is so vital is getting information to people, because the more people that understand what's going on,
[00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:35.343]  The more people there are who are going to stand up and say, no way, not in my name, will you commit these corrupt and heinous acts.
[00:10:35.728 --> 00:10:37.209]  Well, I want your take on two things.
[00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:44.395]  A, is this not incredibly revealing and a huge wake-up call, and that's what we're seeing, and people are already waking up and already angry.
[00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:55.885]  They are really waking up now and are really upset at the fact that, on average, 95% according to the polls, congressmen and women have said they'll get $2,000, $3,000, $9,000, and one senator from California saying no!
[00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.471]  to the bailout, and it still happens.
[00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:10.455]  That's revealing that this establishment doesn't care what the people want, or what the people say, or even what is constitutional.
[00:11:10.475 --> 00:11:11.855]  And secondarily, I want your comment on that.
[00:11:11.896 --> 00:11:15.657]  Secondarily, we have open economic terrorism.
[00:11:16.338 --> 00:11:25.543]  Since when do Presidents and Secretaries of Treasury and Democratic leaders scream, you better give us this power until the bailout or there'll be a depression?
[00:11:25.883 --> 00:11:27.664]  That is pure economic terrorism.
[00:11:29.474 --> 00:11:41.720]  Yeah, but, you know, we're getting used to that because that's the kind of thing that they did to get us into the Iraq War, and that's the kind of thing they do to, you know, when Katrina's hit by a hurricane.
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:47.983]  You know, what they do is to keep us in a state of shock and confusion.
[00:11:48.503 --> 00:11:54.646]  And I'm really disappointed, actually, this morning to see 271 votes in favor of this bailout in spite of the fact
[00:11:58.248 --> 00:11:58.488]  I think
[00:12:14.375 --> 00:12:26.641]  went ahead and voted for this, in spite of the fact that their constituents are dead against it, are in districts that are considered safe enough for them to make these kind of votes without suffering repercussion at the polls.
[00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:43.008]  I mean, I think what we'll see is that a lot of people aren't going to turn out and vote, because they're going to go, you know, this government is too corrupt, and they'll just say, well, I just won't vote this year for a member of Congress who would betray me in this sense.
[00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:50.309]  But I don't see where it's going to mean a substantial shift in governance in the country.
[00:12:50.349 --> 00:13:03.414]  I mean, I don't think the next Congress is going to be significantly different than this one, you know, because of this particular vote or because of a series of bad votes which have happened over the past several years.
[00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.653]  I want to finish playing this clip.
[00:13:09.973 --> 00:13:14.056]  You haven't had a chance to hear it, and then I'll let you finish what you were saying.
[00:13:14.757 --> 00:13:21.463]  This is the Congressman, and this was, and he's coming up, Congressman Brad Sherman, next hour.
[00:13:21.923 --> 00:13:29.570]  This is what he said other members of Congress were told, physical martial law in America if they didn't pass this.
[00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.871]  Okay, this is official.
[00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:31.852]  Here it is.
[00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:38.524]  The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere.
[00:13:39.124 --> 00:13:41.465]  That atmosphere is not justified.
[00:13:42.425 --> 00:14:02.232]  Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
[00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:05.118]  That's what I call fear-mongering.
[00:14:05.898 --> 00:14:06.759]  Unjustified.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.980]  Proven wrong.
[00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:11.804]  We've got a week, we've got two weeks, to write a good bill.
[00:14:12.364 --> 00:14:16.548]  The only way to write, to pass a bad bill, keep the panic pressure on.
[00:14:17.108 --> 00:14:18.890]  Now, what has the Senate done to this bill?
[00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:21.713]  Congressman Dan Hamburg, your comments on that.
[00:14:21.853 --> 00:14:29.299]  You know, I'm afraid that the majority, the great majority of people, not only citizens of this country, but members of the U.S.
[00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:29.820]  Congress,
[00:14:30.256 --> 00:14:49.321]  We're not aware that on August 28th, just about six weeks ago, Bush extended for the seventh time the national state of emergency under which his country has been de facto governed ever since September 11th or September 14th, depending on which document you look at, of 2001.
[00:14:49.801 --> 00:14:56.663]  Bush has extended that state of national emergency under which he implements
[00:14:57.273 --> 00:14:58.334]  Documents like
[00:15:13.849 --> 00:15:14.590]  I think so.
[00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:49.338]  And that is why there is nothing more important to the consciousness of the people of this country than the 9-11 Truth Movement and getting to the bottom of what has instigated this eight-year reign of terror.
[00:15:53.095 --> 00:15:58.178]  Again, going back to economic terrorism, they need this implosion now to get the powers they need.
[00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:01.160]  Just as PDD 51 says, it's clear.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.663]  They start fear-mongering two weeks ago saying, depression, depression, it drives down the market, and then they're given the power.
[00:16:06.983 --> 00:16:08.103]  I mean, it's transparent.
[00:16:08.163 --> 00:16:10.265]  They did this in front of everyone.
[00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:12.726]  This is incredibly criminal.
[00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:18.189]  This is an incredibly criminal act that they're doing, and this shows me they're going for broke.
[00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:19.350]  I think this is just the start.
[00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:22.664]  And I think one way to look at it is this is kind of an economic 9-11.
[00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:35.538]  And I think they are going for broke in terms of destroying the American economy so that they can come back with a whole new globalist approach and sell that to a desperate people.
[00:16:35.938 --> 00:16:38.940]  We'll start seeing things like the North American Union.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.721]  They've already said that!
[00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:40.901]  They've already kissed the European Union.
[00:16:41.522 --> 00:16:46.265]  The Amaro, you know, replacing the dollar, national sovereignty in the trash can.
[00:16:46.785 --> 00:16:50.748]  And these are things that normally people would not tolerate.
[00:16:51.089 --> 00:16:57.514]  But their idea is to get people in such a panic that they will look for the savior.
[00:16:57.554 --> 00:17:03.758]  You know, this is Weimar Republic type stuff that we're going back to in the United States of America.
[00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:04.919]  Unbelievable.
[00:17:04.939 --> 00:17:05.579]  You're absolutely right.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.060]  Stay there, sir.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.640]  We're going to break.
[00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:12.505]  We have Congressman Dan Hamburg on with us, more congressmen coming up, sitting congressmen.
[00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.006]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is happening.
[00:17:15.607 --> 00:17:18.189]  Remember almost three years ago, we snuck in the Bilderberg Group.
[00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:19.810]  We got the information out.
[00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:24.833]  We said they're going to start the implosion by restricting credit on the subprime mortgages.
[00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:26.715]  They are going to engineer this.
[00:17:26.815 --> 00:17:27.555]  We're on record.
[00:17:27.575 --> 00:17:28.536]  Okay?
[00:17:28.636 --> 00:17:29.857]  And now, how did it happen?
[00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:31.438]  Because they run things.
[00:17:31.478 --> 00:17:32.859]  They are orchestrating all of this.
[00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:35.961]  In fact, we're going to skip this break for the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:17:38.303 --> 00:17:40.484]  Congressman, I'm going to skip this break so we don't waste any time.
[00:17:40.504 --> 00:17:41.345]  This is too important.
[00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:45.247]  So we're only here for the internet streams and the TV viewers.
[00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:54.643]  We also have a big story about a known government asset putting out a hoax that all the banks were going to close next week.
[00:17:54.723 --> 00:17:56.524]  I want to get your take on that later.
[00:17:56.564 --> 00:18:01.445]  But other points you want to make right now, sir, about ways to counter this and where you see this going?
[00:18:02.745 --> 00:18:07.666]  Well, I think the best way to counter this, as I said before, is information.
[00:18:07.846 --> 00:18:16.208]  And I think that the place we're really going to get into trouble, and I think they've already prepared themselves for this, is shutting down of the Internet.
[00:18:17.248 --> 00:18:29.869]  And Stanford professor recently said that this is in the works and there is a plan for a so-called E-terror attack.
[00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.072]  Which will necessitate the government taking much stricter control over the internet.
[00:18:35.052 --> 00:18:39.034]  So, that's something... That's right, he openly talked about it.
[00:18:39.354 --> 00:18:41.715]  Internet too, that they're setting it all up.
[00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:43.495]  Regulations, taxation.
[00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:51.018]  YouTube and Google have now accepted Senator Lieberman's deal that whatever the government says take off, they take off.
[00:18:51.298 --> 00:18:52.319]  I mean, it's already happening.
[00:18:53.072 --> 00:18:59.015]  Well, yeah, and it's much like the Patriot Act, which was all written and ready to go when 9-11 happened.
[00:18:59.075 --> 00:19:04.879]  Strangely enough, they had this, you know, thousand-plus page bill already written when 9-11 happened.
[00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:14.664]  And I think that is a tremendous threat, because I think the Internet is an incredible organizing tool right now that those of us who are
[00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:20.504]  You know, totally against what we see our government doing.
[00:19:20.524 --> 00:19:24.948]  I think this is a way we do pull ourselves together and communicate with each other.
[00:19:24.968 --> 00:19:39.160]  And even to the extent of, you know, the protests that went on around the country against this bailout bill were organized by, you know, one guy in New York City who put out an email to a bunch of his friends and the thing
[00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:41.339]  You know, just just mushroomed.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:56.363]  And that's the way I see people taking to the streets in this country is communicating with each other through the Internet and setting up, you know, mass protests and mass actions, which which, you know, will they work?
[00:19:56.523 --> 00:19:57.043]  I don't know.
[00:19:57.163 --> 00:20:03.665]  But I do think people are getting to the point where, you know, they're just not going to sit back in their
[00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:04.685]  I think so.
[00:20:15.962 --> 00:20:21.384]  To try to shore up the economy of the country because they just don't have the money to spend any longer.
[00:20:21.904 --> 00:20:28.707]  So I think things are spiraling and I think things are happening very fast right now.
[00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:38.190]  But I think the good news is that the United States of America is going to have to pay the piper at some point.
[00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:45.389]  For all the things that have gone on in the last whatever, you know... Stay there, we're coming back to the full audience.
[00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:46.129]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.350]  Here we go.
[00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:54.382]  Congressman Dan Hamburg is our guest.
[00:20:54.983 --> 00:20:57.624]  He's been predicting and writing about the martial law takeover.
[00:20:58.184 --> 00:20:59.324]  Something else is happening.
[00:21:00.185 --> 00:21:04.427]  I was at a little restaurant yesterday grabbing some tacos and I heard people talking about, did you hear?
[00:21:04.927 --> 00:21:06.488]  All the banks will be shut next week.
[00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:07.808]  Everything's going to shut down.
[00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:08.668]  It's over.
[00:21:08.768 --> 00:21:09.609]  Runs on the banks.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:19.005]  Then I got back to the office and Rob was in there going, man, I'm getting all these emails from family and people that aren't even into this stuff about how all the banks are going to shut down next week.
[00:21:19.405 --> 00:21:20.746]  And it wouldn't really say where it was from.
[00:21:20.786 --> 00:21:26.909]  We tracked it back to a reported white supremacist who is a caricature of white supremacists.
[00:21:26.929 --> 00:21:29.871]  And I'm not defending white supremacists, but it's very clownish.
[00:21:30.671 --> 00:21:31.912]  And it's Hal Turner.
[00:21:31.932 --> 00:21:33.093]  I don't like giving the guy attention.
[00:21:34.697 --> 00:21:39.122]  And he says things, you know, that if I said them or somebody else said them, he'd be arrested.
[00:21:39.162 --> 00:21:51.196]  He says, go, you know, blast judges, politicians, go physically attack people, names names, you know, does ridiculous parodies of black people, calling them just every name in the book.
[00:21:53.138 --> 00:22:10.874]  And then of course it turns out that he's tied in with these white supremacist groups that it turned out the leaders are feds and then it did come out, the story's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and it's titled, a Paul Watson story, Hoax Bank Closure Story Peddles Bailout Propaganda.
[00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:17.960]  No surprise we learn the source of the hoax is Hal Turner who was exposed earlier this year as an FBI informant.
[00:22:18.661 --> 00:22:26.910]  Posing as a white supremacist, and he's the guy that comes out with with with Amaro coins that some private mint does and then discredits the fact that they are setting up an Amaro.
[00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:33.196]  Or he's the guy that hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax, but the the the story he put out
[00:22:33.937 --> 00:22:37.680]  Says we've got to have the bailout or everything's destroyed.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.402]  So it also always has an angle.
[00:22:39.762 --> 00:22:42.444]  Now this will be used to criticize the internet.
[00:22:42.504 --> 00:22:48.489]  CNN hired reporters to then put out fake stories about Steve Jobs having a heart attack yesterday.
[00:22:48.849 --> 00:22:51.852]  Now CNN's saying we better shut down the web and restrict free speech.
[00:22:52.112 --> 00:22:54.894]  Look what independent people do, but the guy works for them.
[00:22:55.615 --> 00:22:58.118]  And then they're also saying they want to shut the web down, censor it.
[00:22:58.438 --> 00:23:06.647]  We were just talking about it behind the scenes on the internet streams, not just the MNFM, but during the break at PrisonPlanet.tv with our guest, the Congressman.
[00:23:07.508 --> 00:23:12.814]  So, Internet2, Lieberman, YouTube and Google are now banning whatever the government wants.
[00:23:13.294 --> 00:23:16.455]  I mean, it's happening, and they're using people like this to do it.
[00:23:16.515 --> 00:23:19.216]  And this is what can cause bank runs, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:19.236 --> 00:23:20.797]  You've heard Bush saying, bank run, bank run.
[00:23:21.017 --> 00:23:21.978]  We don't want bank runs.
[00:23:22.258 --> 00:23:23.038]  Your money's safe.
[00:23:23.098 --> 00:23:23.578]  Bank run.
[00:23:23.758 --> 00:23:25.199]  You know, trying to make people bank run.
[00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:28.420]  The government wants to make this worse right now.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.280]  Congressman?
[00:23:30.281 --> 00:23:31.341]  Well, I think that's right.
[00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:34.423]  You know, I think the worse it gets, the more people panic.
[00:23:35.163 --> 00:23:42.926]  And we know from Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, that there's nothing that makes people more malleable than when they're in a state of panic.
[00:23:43.436 --> 00:23:48.501]  And they want, you know, anything that will relieve their panic, they will go for.
[00:23:48.541 --> 00:23:50.944]  And this is the bet that they're making.
[00:23:51.084 --> 00:24:06.160]  They're believing that if they, you know, they've already shredded the Constitution, and they believe that now if they, you know, tank the economy, they will frighten people, and then they will come up with their plan to save them.
[00:24:06.893 --> 00:24:18.539]  And it'll be us, the people, the citizens of this country, the people who with our taxes have been supporting this entire charade, who are going to be left
[00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.352]  You know, with basically nothing.
[00:24:22.412 --> 00:24:39.325]  I mean, I think the strategy is to put all of us ordinary people in a subservient position where we no longer really have anything to say about the way we're governed, and we enter this new world order in which the global economy
[00:24:39.835 --> 00:24:46.677]  And a small financial, military, political, industrial elite makes all the decisions for the rest of us.
[00:24:47.137 --> 00:24:55.680]  And really, you know, some people have said that the problem with this bailout is that, you know, we have capitalism on the way up and socialism on the way down.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.642]  But the characterization that makes more sense to me is that we're now in an area of authoritarian capitalism.
[00:25:02.282 --> 00:25:05.983]  And we the people are not the authorities.
[00:25:06.423 --> 00:25:06.884]  That's right.
[00:25:06.984 --> 00:25:13.029]  They privatize profit and they socialize loss and they pass it on to the average people.
[00:25:13.249 --> 00:25:13.990]  It's feudalism.
[00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.671]  Stay there.
[00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:16.793]  We'll be back in one minute for five more minutes with our guest.

[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.023]  Coming up in about 15 minutes, Congressman Brad Sherman.
[00:26:51.043 --> 00:26:55.027]  It was told, vote for this or we'll declare physical martial law.
[00:26:55.848 --> 00:26:58.630]  Ron Paul, probably popping in.
[00:27:00.092 --> 00:27:01.633]  Comment on the bailout passing.
[00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:03.175]  This is the banker takeover.
[00:27:03.935 --> 00:27:06.017]  Former Congressman Dan Hamburg joins us.
[00:27:07.076 --> 00:27:13.550]  Written major articles for major publications detailing how they were planning this controlled financial implosion 16 months ago.
[00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.356]  It was one of the bigger ones in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:27:17.657 --> 00:27:18.897]  He's with us for about five more minutes.
[00:27:19.618 --> 00:27:21.478]  You heard him say they're coming after the web.
[00:27:21.518 --> 00:27:22.518]  They're attacking the web.
[00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:23.679]  That's their main target.
[00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:26.539]  And a false flag attack that's even come out in mainstream news.
[00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:28.880]  They launch regulations, taxes.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.700]  It's all happening.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:38.302]  And they have their reported agents, FBI informant, their reported FBI informant, putting out a hoax that's gotten traction I've never seen.
[00:27:38.582 --> 00:27:40.023]  And he's put out a bunch of hoaxes before.
[00:27:40.703 --> 00:27:43.624]  And believe me, I don't want to get in a fight with this guy, but I have to for the Republic.
[00:27:43.884 --> 00:27:45.324]  Very dangerous crew around him.
[00:27:46.925 --> 00:27:49.606]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's a big history of white supremacists being fed.
[00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:50.466]  It's come out in the news.
[00:27:51.026 --> 00:27:52.947]  In Texas Monthly and Reuters, everywhere.
[00:27:52.967 --> 00:27:54.687]  It's kept very quiet.
[00:27:55.388 --> 00:27:59.089]  But it's out there for you saying that all the banks are going to shut down next week.
[00:27:59.609 --> 00:28:01.189]  And this has gotten huge traction.
[00:28:01.209 --> 00:28:02.850]  They're talking about it on the street in Austin.
[00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.690]  We can combat this.
[00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:09.332]  Go get our article, Hoax, Bank, Closure Story, Pedals, Bailout Propaganda.
[00:28:09.812 --> 00:28:12.773]  Get it, get it out to everybody you know and fight this lie.
[00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:18.794]  And again, it mirrors the White House saying, do everything we say, give us all the power or depression.
[00:28:18.854 --> 00:28:21.895]  They want to orchestrate it to bring in their solution.
[00:28:22.175 --> 00:28:26.576]  Help us get the story out that martial law was threatened on Congress.
[00:28:26.596 --> 00:28:28.997]  Now they've signed over martial law power financially.
[00:28:29.397 --> 00:28:31.918]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said that an hour and a half ago here.
[00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:37.159]  I mean this is, we've got the key info up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:39.780]  Help us counter the lies.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.861]  Now is the key time in the battle because the people are against what the criminal groups in the government are doing, these cartels.
[00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:48.782]  And so they're really ready to hear the truth right now.
[00:28:48.862 --> 00:28:50.142]  Congressman, how important is this?
[00:28:50.482 --> 00:28:58.284]  You have Brad Sherman on and when you have Ron Paul on later, I hope that you will ask them if they understand
[00:28:59.088 --> 00:29:11.635]  What Bush did on August 28th, when he extended the so-called State of National Emergency, and extended by implication, and I'm sure by law, H.S.P.D.
[00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:12.555]  20 and N.S.P.D.
[00:29:13.156 --> 00:29:12.555]  51.
[00:29:13.696 --> 00:29:26.683]  I don't believe, and I've discussed this with one of the national authorities on it, Peter Dale Scott, I don't believe that Congress is even aware of their statutory responsibilities under the National Emergencies Act.
[00:29:27.153 --> 00:29:38.839]  To review any state of emergency declared by the President by statute has to be reviewed by the House and the Senate with resolutions passed to continue them every six months.
[00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:44.182]  And in nearly, what has it been, seven years since 9-11, there has never, never once been a
[00:29:48.838 --> 00:29:57.225]  A session of the House or the Senate in which the state of emergency has been even acknowledged to exist.
[00:29:57.345 --> 00:29:58.967]  And Congressman, what you're saying is key.
[00:29:59.307 --> 00:30:03.071]  We have been on the stove with the Marshall Law turned on simmer.
[00:30:03.411 --> 00:30:05.473]  They are now jacking it up to high.
[00:30:06.093 --> 00:30:07.275]  Well, that's exactly right.
[00:30:07.755 --> 00:30:10.838]  And they do have these measures in place.
[00:30:11.298 --> 00:30:30.372]  In fact, we know how bad they are by what we can see, but when Peter Defazio and Benny Thompson and members of the House Homeland Security Committee tried to find out what was in the agenda under which we, the United States of America, are being ruled, they were told that they were not
[00:30:31.172 --> 00:30:34.613]  They were not going to be allowed to see this information.
[00:30:34.673 --> 00:30:36.073]  And then the chairman asked for it.
[00:30:36.113 --> 00:30:44.995]  So as a former congressman, what does that mean when the White House, the executive, tells the legislative, which is co-equal, that they're not allowed to be involved in that?
[00:30:45.095 --> 00:30:46.795]  That is dictatorship of the executive.
[00:30:47.495 --> 00:30:48.675]  Well, it absolutely is.
[00:30:48.735 --> 00:30:57.357]  And that's why I'm saying we are already under this so-called continuity of government, you know, this COG formulation.
[00:30:57.904 --> 00:31:01.116]  By virtue of the fact that the Congress has become
[00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:04.562]  Basically, the schedule.
[00:31:04.942 --> 00:31:11.504]  Basically, the Congress is no longer a co-equal branch of the government.
[00:31:11.604 --> 00:31:26.428]  We've got to end the main interview with you, and the other congressman is coming up in about ten minutes, but for the internet listeners and the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, let's do three final minutes with you about solutions, and folks can later see that on PrisonPlanet.TV and when it's ripped all over the web.
[00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:31.210]  So we'll do three more minutes with our guest, the Honorable Congressman Dan Hamburg.
[00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:35.751]  Okay, well, I'm very glad to have a few minutes to talk to Alex's audience out there and to
[00:32:01.809 --> 00:32:24.958]  To let them know that there are many of us out there, and even some of us who have served in Congress, who realize that bailing out the rich, that $700 billion dollar bailouts, which could end up being much more than that, are certainly not in the interest of the people of this country.
[00:32:25.399 --> 00:32:26.139]  And when you hear
[00:32:27.187 --> 00:32:45.435]  Some of the figures that are being used by people like Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who says that the overall quantity of debt that the American people are going to be shouldering for generations to come is in the many, many trillions of dollars.
[00:32:45.515 --> 00:32:52.419]  He actually used the figure a quarter of a quadrillion.
[00:32:52.539 --> 00:32:55.340]  I have never heard the term quadrillion.
[00:32:57.257 --> 00:32:59.898]  I heard Dennis Kucinich speaking of it the other day.
[00:32:59.918 --> 00:33:20.651]  So what they have done in a short period of time, now remember when Clinton was in office, and I did not like Bill Clinton, in fact it was during Clinton's second administration that I left the Democratic Party and became a member of the Green Party, but it was during those years that the country actually built up
[00:33:21.341 --> 00:33:23.222]  A budget surplus.
[00:33:23.842 --> 00:33:33.645]  When George Bush came into office, I predicted that he would crash the economy in a short period of time, and he has done that.
[00:33:34.086 --> 00:33:39.928]  And you can't look at what has happened over the last eight years and think that it was not willful.
[00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:41.668]  It was willful.
[00:33:41.868 --> 00:33:46.270]  They do have a very strange
[00:33:47.206 --> 00:33:55.091]  Uh, plan in place under which they will become more powerful and we will become less powerful.
[00:33:55.651 --> 00:34:01.435]  And our constitutional rights, uh, have been compromised again and again and again.
[00:34:01.455 --> 00:34:14.143]  Uh, our role as taxpayers has become compromised to where we are paying, we, the people are paying for the sins of the few and the greed and the corruption of the few.
[00:34:15.134 --> 00:34:17.094]  And we have to put a stop to it.
[00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:20.315]  We simply have to say no.
[00:34:20.615 --> 00:34:33.318]  We may, in a short period of time, have to not only say no, but speak no in ways that we have never been called on to do before.
[00:34:33.338 --> 00:34:35.218]  Alright, the gentleman's time has expired.
[00:34:35.238 --> 00:34:36.778]  We're going to come back to the full audience.
[00:34:36.798 --> 00:34:39.179]  I want you to plug your great websites with a lot of information.
[00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:40.239]  We'll close this out.
[00:34:40.259 --> 00:34:40.599]  Here we go.
[00:34:41.937 --> 00:34:44.898]  ...enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:34:45.498 --> 00:34:48.539]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:59.021]  Alright, Congressman, in closing, tell us about a couple of your websites so people can check out some of the articles you've written and the research you've done, documenting everything you've been saying.
[00:35:00.601 --> 00:35:10.844]  Myself and my co-author Louis Seiler, we have several articles that are up on our website, many articles, www.voiceoftheenvironment.org,
[00:35:11.477 --> 00:35:14.341]  Also, www.voteaction.org.
[00:35:14.401 --> 00:35:15.803]  You can see the articles we've written.
[00:35:15.863 --> 00:35:20.649]  A recent article we wrote on state of emergency the last six months of the Bush administration.
[00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:26.037]  Many of the things that we were talking about in that article, sadly, now seem to be coming to pass.
[00:35:27.108 --> 00:35:27.728]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[00:35:27.748 --> 00:35:27.968]  Good luck.
[00:35:45.666 --> 00:35:47.047]  Good night and good luck and God bless you.
[00:35:47.087 --> 00:35:47.487]  Take care.
[00:35:48.027 --> 00:35:55.472]  All right, in the five minutes or so, while we're waiting for the next congressman, sitting congressman, Brad Sherman, to call in, I want to play, and then later we'll play the rest of it.
[00:35:55.852 --> 00:36:09.441]  This is in, like, just a few minutes into Matrix of Evil, where I go before the city council with over a thousand others, but only about a hundred got to speak because of time constraints for four hours, and expose the Patriot Act and laid out what's now happening.
[00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:12.242]  We'll play as much of this as we can while we get the congressman on.
[00:36:12.543 --> 00:36:12.943]  Here it is.
[00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:15.736]  Okay.
[00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:18.618]  Okay, so Mr. Jones, you're now at your maximum of 15 minutes.
[00:36:18.638 --> 00:36:24.362]  I just will say, folks, occasionally you'll see myself or council members leaving the dais.
[00:36:24.702 --> 00:36:29.805]  I promise you when we're back in the back, there's a television and audio we can hear and see.
[00:36:29.885 --> 00:36:31.266]  Oh yes, I believe you.
[00:36:31.406 --> 00:36:34.068]  Don't be offended when I leave.
[00:36:34.368 --> 00:36:34.968]  I'm not offended.
[00:36:35.368 --> 00:36:35.949]  Welcome, Mr. Jones.
[00:36:35.969 --> 00:36:36.669]  You have 15 minutes.
[00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:37.550]  Well, thank you.
[00:36:38.343 --> 00:36:40.064]  And I hope you do stay, because this is important.
[00:36:40.084 --> 00:36:44.607]  And I want to thank the people that came here that are part of the second American revolution.
[00:36:44.647 --> 00:36:45.788]  We shall prevail.
[00:36:46.528 --> 00:36:47.709]  That is a guarantee.
[00:36:51.972 --> 00:36:56.215]  Because as the new world order turns up the heat, they're going to form more resistance.
[00:36:56.835 --> 00:37:01.458]  The tighter they squeeze, the more people are going to have that light bulb go off above their head.
[00:37:01.994 --> 00:37:08.998]  Now I believe this council is made up of good people and I think it's great that Jackie Goodman, Mayor of Proteum, has brought this forward.
[00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.639]  Let's go through the facts.
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:25.409]  And John Ashcroft and Lord Bush and their military industrial complex owners who are setting up military dictatorship, I mean this is admitted, BNAC documents, cannot hide the reality of what's happening.
[00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:28.711]  In fact, Ashcroft six months ago really committed a federal crime.
[00:37:29.517 --> 00:37:30.998]  He's sworn testimony before the House and Senate.
[00:37:31.018 --> 00:37:32.818]  He said there is no new terrorism legislation.
[00:37:32.878 --> 00:37:33.599]  It's not been introduced.
[00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.740]  The Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.261]  The Justice Domestic Security Enhancement Act.
[00:37:38.481 --> 00:37:39.541]  House and Senate versions.
[00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:42.042]  It's like if I got up here and said the sun didn't come up this morning.
[00:37:42.242 --> 00:37:42.922]  He'd laugh at me.
[00:37:43.082 --> 00:37:44.383]  But the press didn't call him on it.
[00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:50.005]  Now he's saying there is a Patriot Act II and Victory Act I and Victory Act II and you better pass all of them.
[00:37:50.546 --> 00:37:53.087]  You know what's in Patriot Act II, Section 501?
[00:37:53.927 --> 00:37:57.768]  You put the description of a terrorist under Section 802 of the first Patriot Act.
[00:37:58.449 --> 00:37:59.089]  You can be arrested.
[00:37:59.978 --> 00:38:00.799]  Secretly executed.
[00:38:01.959 --> 00:38:02.419]  That's right.
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.981]  A three military judge panel.
[00:38:06.582 --> 00:38:15.826]  Now what is section 802 of the first Patriot Act that passed on October 27, 2001 at five in the morning when no one was allowed to read it?
[00:38:16.367 --> 00:38:17.567]  According to members of Congress.
[00:38:18.688 --> 00:38:24.031]  The definition of terrorist is any action that endangers human life that is a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:38:25.331 --> 00:38:28.353]  They have many other definitions about anything that influences government.
[00:38:29.246 --> 00:38:30.206]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:38:30.386 --> 00:38:31.967]  They're counting on you not reading it.
[00:38:32.147 --> 00:38:33.467]  They're counting on you not finding it.
[00:38:34.507 --> 00:38:40.709]  Ron Paul and others have pointed out that Hitler and Stalin and people didn't have the nerve to put stuff like this down on paper.
[00:38:40.749 --> 00:38:41.629]  They just did it!
[00:38:41.649 --> 00:38:45.150]  That's what's so amazing about this.
[00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.470]  And to see the Assistant U.S.
[00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:53.272]  Attorney here peddling this is really sad, but I know it's under orders.
[00:38:54.212 --> 00:38:57.653]  Because two months ago it was reported that Ashcroft met out in Hollywood
[00:38:58.339 --> 00:39:02.262]  We're the heads, the big editors of all the newspapers, and the heads of law enforcement.
[00:39:02.963 --> 00:39:08.427]  And so we'd like you to go out and write editorials, editors, we'd like you as attorneys, as attorneys, write editorials, get on talk shows.
[00:39:09.568 --> 00:39:12.250]  Two months ago it was reported that Ashcroft met out in Hollywood.
[00:39:12.891 --> 00:39:16.814]  We're the heads, the big editors of all the newspapers, and the heads of law enforcement.
[00:39:17.534 --> 00:39:22.979]  And so we'd like you to go out and write editorials, editors, we'd like you as attorneys, as attorneys, write editorials, get on talk shows.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.681]  Get out there and sell the
[00:39:26.491 --> 00:39:29.354]  This is the people, this is good, this is a wonderful thing.
[00:39:30.395 --> 00:39:37.341]  So I want the council, in case you don't know this, and the people here today to understand that it's a stage managed event.
[00:39:37.621 --> 00:39:43.806]  I mean it really was hatched in a smoky room to to oppress you, to manipulate you, to con you.
[00:39:44.927 --> 00:39:52.394]  That makes me very angry and that's why it's so exciting that this council may simply just say we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution
[00:39:53.221 --> 00:39:56.583]  And we will not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:39:56.863 --> 00:39:59.205]  And in this city, America is still America.
[00:39:59.405 --> 00:40:00.406]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[00:40:02.727 --> 00:40:05.649]  Now, I'm sure you heard about five years ago about the FBI Crime Lab.
[00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:09.311]  The head of it, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, who I've interviewed several times, said, I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:40:09.331 --> 00:40:11.452]  We've been framing people, manufacturing evidence.
[00:40:11.613 --> 00:40:12.413]  This is out of control.
[00:40:14.334 --> 00:40:18.077]  I've interviewed FBI agent Tyrone Powers, who talked about how they would frame people.
[00:40:18.737 --> 00:40:20.178]  The different criminal things they would do.
[00:40:21.525 --> 00:40:22.885]  Tulia, Texas.
[00:40:22.905 --> 00:40:23.586]  56 black people.
[00:40:23.966 --> 00:40:24.806]  No criminal record.
[00:40:24.946 --> 00:40:25.986]  No drug paraphernalia.
[00:40:26.046 --> 00:40:26.547]  No nothing.
[00:40:26.827 --> 00:40:32.388]  On the word of one corrupt cop, gave them all 20 to 90 years in prison.
[00:40:33.409 --> 00:40:34.349]  Now you think about that.
[00:40:34.369 --> 00:40:36.129]  Houston Crime Lab.
[00:40:36.149 --> 00:40:39.510]  Thousands framed indiscriminately.
[00:40:40.711 --> 00:40:43.852]  The police chief had to admit it because his job's on the line.
[00:40:43.872 --> 00:40:45.912]  He's claiming, oh, I'm going to fix that problem.
[00:40:46.793 --> 00:40:51.194]  It's equivalent of Harriman Goring, you know, promising to stop what Hitler was up to.
[00:40:52.256 --> 00:40:54.097]  This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:54.357 --> 00:40:57.158]  So this is why we restrict the scope and size of government.
[00:40:57.399 --> 00:40:58.919]  And it's power over us and our lives.
[00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:00.660]  Because we know there's criminals on the street.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.801]  We know there's bad people.
[00:41:01.921 --> 00:41:14.727]  But they don't have the massive mechanisms, the machinery of government, and military, and militarized police, and prison complexes to oppress at levels... Alex, are you there?
[00:41:17.125 --> 00:41:17.405]  Hello?
[00:41:17.786 --> 00:41:20.169]  Yeah, we're on air right now, streaming also on the internet.
[00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:21.130]  Okay, I got your guess.
[00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.851]  Alright, here we go, thanks.
[00:41:21.871 --> 00:41:28.480]  So don't tell me, Lita, we shouldn't have a concern with the most draconian legislation in the history of the world!
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.986]  Dwarfing Byzantine Spain and France is rolled out against the people!
[00:41:35.999 --> 00:41:37.119]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:46.002]  That was going back, what, four years ago when we got Austin to throw out the Patriot Act and say the Bill of Rights and Constitution still existed.
[00:41:46.322 --> 00:41:48.822]  And before the show ends, I'm going to air the rest of my speech there.
[00:41:48.862 --> 00:41:50.903]  We'll back it up a little bit so you can hear it all.
[00:41:50.923 --> 00:41:52.263]  That's from the film Matrix of Evil.
[00:41:52.823 --> 00:41:58.825]  I am very honored to have Congressman Brad Sherman on the air with us.
[00:41:59.545 --> 00:42:14.052]  Harvard Law School, this is education, JD, Magna Cum Laude, UCLA, BA, he goes on, instructor, Harvard Law, School International Tax Program, his bio goes on and on, so he can certainly speak to the fact of martial law.
[00:42:14.452 --> 00:42:17.953]  We've talked to other congressmen here on air that have said yes, they've been threatened with the U.S.
[00:42:17.973 --> 00:42:22.736]  collapsing, martial law being installed, the Army has announced in the Army Times,
[00:42:24.137 --> 00:42:30.704]  That, oh, NORTHCOM's deploying a brigade, going to bring others in for civil unrest, we'll use our microwave cannons on the people.
[00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:41.978]  I mean, this is all happening in the last week, and we saw the financial terrorism of the White House saying, pass this bill, give us immunity, give us all this power, or
[00:42:43.217 --> 00:42:47.398]  We're going to have a depression, and then it didn't pass Monday, so the market dropped $1 trillion, $200 billion.
[00:42:47.738 --> 00:42:49.899]  If that isn't economic terrorism, I don't know what is.
[00:42:50.399 --> 00:42:51.700]  So, we have the Congressman almost.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.620]  We only have him for five minutes, five, six minutes.
[00:42:54.241 --> 00:42:56.201]  Congressman Brad Sherman, thank you for coming on, sir.
[00:42:57.002 --> 00:42:57.802]  Good to be with you.
[00:42:57.822 --> 00:43:05.624]  You know, Wall Street used these panic tactics to get us to pass this $700 billion.
[00:43:05.664 --> 00:43:08.986]  Well, what the bill really is is $700 billion in unmarked bills.
[00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:19.750]  They said the market would drop by 4,000 points, blood would flow in the streets, and lions would be devouring children in the parks of Los Angeles.
[00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:31.772]  Now that the bill has passed, our economy is still going to be very bad in the fall and winter, but the Wall Street folks will come out and say, well, it was a great bill.
[00:43:32.372 --> 00:43:35.733]  After all, there are no lions in the parks of Los Angeles.
[00:43:36.343 --> 00:43:55.975]  So, we've got to do everything we can to focus people's attention on this bill as it's carried out, because it allows Paulson to go up to Wall Street, he can give money to one firm, he cannot return phone calls from another firm, he can take
[00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:05.236]  He can, if he wants, find out which firms are donating to the 527 organizations which take secret contributions and then make political advertising.
[00:44:05.696 --> 00:44:07.698]  He can look at the RNC donor list.
[00:44:08.118 --> 00:44:09.319]  He can do anything he wants.
[00:44:09.519 --> 00:44:23.009]  Congressman, I know that you're moving forward now, as a good congressman would, with your constituents now that the corruption has passed through economic terrorism, but let's go back to what you said on the floor in the last 24 hours about members of Congress, and I've talked to some.
[00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:25.670]  They're afraid to even come on and talk about it being told.
[00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:30.232]  There will be martial law in America and we'll just do this with or without you if you don't do this.
[00:44:30.352 --> 00:44:31.633]  That is incredible.
[00:44:31.853 --> 00:44:39.556]  And I just had the former head of the Treasury on earlier, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts from Reagan, head of policy, saying that this gives them economic martial law.
[00:44:40.637 --> 00:44:45.899]  Well, I know that some comments like that were made.
[00:44:46.199 --> 00:44:48.480]  I didn't take them seriously.
[00:44:48.801 --> 00:44:49.561]  I know some would.
[00:44:50.423 --> 00:44:56.866]  I thought it was just an overblown effort to create a panic in order to pass a bad bill.
[00:44:56.946 --> 00:44:58.206]  Is that not terrorism?
[00:44:58.286 --> 00:45:02.748]  I mean, is that not the definition to threaten harm or carry out harm for a political aim, sir?
[00:45:04.149 --> 00:45:06.610]  Well, they didn't say they'd shoot anybody.
[00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:18.375]  So, usually terrorism involves threats of violence, and whether a drop in the Dow is violent or not, I mean, I'm sure
[00:45:19.198 --> 00:45:24.940]  That somebody had a heart attack when the market dropped a few hundred points.
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.501]  But keep in mind, we passed the bill and I'm told the market is down.
[00:45:28.862 --> 00:45:30.022]  Is it not?
[00:45:30.042 --> 00:45:31.383]  Well, sir, we have cyber-terrorism.
[00:45:31.403 --> 00:45:35.304]  They call hacking terrorism under the Patriot Act, Section 802.
[00:45:35.844 --> 00:45:39.886]  Any action, you know, they claim is even a misdemeanor as terrorism.
[00:45:39.926 --> 00:45:46.188]  I mean, to have a trillion, two hundred billion dollar loss in one day with them fear-mongering, I call that economic terrorism.
[00:45:46.208 --> 00:45:48.069]  Well, I don't think of it as that big a loss.
[00:45:49.009 --> 00:45:49.770]  I understand.
[00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:06.684]  I don't know.
[00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:26.650]  Sir, here's the $64 million question.
[00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:33.213]  You and other members of Congress say, yeah, well, there were some people threatening martial law, but we don't, you know, think they meant it.
[00:46:33.233 --> 00:46:37.015]  They were just trying to fearmonger, which I call terrorism, into it.
[00:46:37.335 --> 00:46:38.715]  That's a huge issue.
[00:46:39.116 --> 00:46:40.936]  Specifically, sir, we need to know names.
[00:46:41.196 --> 00:46:46.799]  Who told you that they were told that martial law and blood in the streets, as you said, what happened?
[00:46:47.318 --> 00:46:53.723]  Private conversations between members on the floor, you really can't reveal without the permission of the other party.
[00:46:53.743 --> 00:46:56.806]  I understand, but were there arm twisters coming up or were they scared?
[00:46:56.846 --> 00:46:58.507]  I mean, how was it said specifically?
[00:46:58.887 --> 00:47:01.649]  I think these were people who really believed what they were saying.
[00:47:01.689 --> 00:47:08.134]  I don't think these were people who were, you know, got called by Goldman Sachs and said, well, go say this or go say that.
[00:47:08.655 --> 00:47:10.777]  The panic takes a...
[00:47:12.846 --> 00:47:13.767]  A life of its own.
[00:47:13.887 --> 00:47:16.167]  One person says the market will drop 2,000 points.
[00:47:16.207 --> 00:47:17.468]  Somebody else says 2,500.
[00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:18.528]  Somebody else says 3,000.
[00:47:19.108 --> 00:47:23.229]  Somebody else says the unemployment will jump immediately to 9%.
[00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:24.610]  It spreads.
[00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:25.930]  It gets worse and worse.
[00:47:27.011 --> 00:47:36.294]  I don't think there was, or at least I'm not aware of this being carefully orchestrated.
[00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:40.975]  But I think now what we have to do is expose those circumstances.
[00:47:41.454 --> 00:47:51.104]  Where we're bailing out a particular firm and how many of the executives at that firm are continuing to make a million dollars a year, five million dollars a year, twenty million dollars a year.
[00:47:51.645 --> 00:47:55.329]  That's the message that needs to get out each and every time.
[00:47:57.733 --> 00:48:03.258]  By the way, Congressman, you are, for the listeners, uniquely positioned to be able to comment on all this.
[00:48:03.938 --> 00:48:14.367]  You work for some of the most important and prestigious firms doing audits of multinational corporations and of government entities, so you know what you're talking about.
[00:48:14.447 --> 00:48:20.833]  I know what I'm talking about, but there's going to be a lot of information that is not public, and it's going to take
[00:48:21.094 --> 00:48:26.996]  Investigative reporters to find out things that congressmen can't find out and that the public is not going to be aware of.
[00:48:27.423 --> 00:48:31.025]  You know, I have to go right now, but it's been a pleasure being with you.
[00:48:31.285 --> 00:48:33.247]  Sir, let us get you back on for longer in the near future.
[00:48:33.287 --> 00:48:33.927]  Thank you, Congressman.
[00:48:33.947 --> 00:48:34.527]  I look forward to it.
[00:48:34.707 --> 00:48:35.128]  Thank you.
[00:48:35.968 --> 00:48:40.611]  We skipped that break because we got him on a few minutes late, and then he only had about five, six minutes.
[00:48:40.971 --> 00:48:42.652]  So there you heard it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:43.173 --> 00:48:51.478]  Yeah, there were people on the floor saying they were told martial law and literal blood in the streets if this didn't happen, and they were told this, but I can't tell you who told me.
[00:48:52.438 --> 00:48:58.141]  Meanwhile, the Army is in the Army Times saying, oh, we're here for, you know, for civil emergency martial law.
[00:48:58.441 --> 00:49:07.025]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act says that the governors run nothing, Congress runs nothing, PDD 51, it's all there and this is being threatened.
[00:49:07.365 --> 00:49:12.888]  And now, according to Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Roberts earlier, this gives economic martial law power to the Treasury.
[00:49:13.148 --> 00:49:14.849]  So, one way or the other, they got it.
[00:49:16.149 --> 00:49:17.150]  Now, I'm going to do this.
[00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:18.851]  I want to open the phones up.
[00:49:20.231 --> 00:49:21.472]  I want to open the phones up.
[00:49:22.705 --> 00:49:30.393]  For people out there listening at the bottom of the hour, specifically on what you think of the banker takeover and the Marshall Law and all of it.
[00:49:30.974 --> 00:49:35.138]  And we're busting our butts here to bring you these congressmen, these eyewitnesses, these reports.
[00:49:35.178 --> 00:49:38.262]  We really appreciate all of you tuning in today.
[00:49:38.462 --> 00:49:39.303]  Record audiences.
[00:49:39.583 --> 00:49:42.046]  The internet's a small part of our audience, hundreds of thousands.
[00:49:43.345 --> 00:49:49.528]  But still, it's a key gauge, and it's record streams listening on the InfoWars streams, record people tuned in just there.
[00:49:49.648 --> 00:49:54.171]  I know there's record numbers listening on the AM and FM dials, shortwave satellite right now.
[00:49:54.271 --> 00:49:55.132]  The internet's engaged.
[00:49:55.172 --> 00:49:56.452]  By the way, I misspoke earlier.
[00:49:56.492 --> 00:49:58.733]  I said 83,000 people a day download the podcast.
[00:49:59.054 --> 00:49:59.394]  It's now 98,000.
[00:49:59.614 --> 00:50:08.659]  In one week, it's grown to 98,000 a day downloading the free podcast at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:08.919 --> 00:50:10.380]  Now, we skipped this network break.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:10.780]  Don't worry.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.021]  Sponsors will get your ads played.
[00:50:12.801 --> 00:50:16.686]  Just on a later day for that break there.
[00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:19.950]  But in times like these, we've got to take every minute we've got.
[00:50:20.791 --> 00:50:22.613]  So I didn't just skip that on the internet streams.
[00:50:23.054 --> 00:50:23.955]  We skipped that network.
[00:50:25.416 --> 00:50:27.378]  Network-wide, but I'm only going to give each caller about a minute.
[00:50:27.418 --> 00:50:29.899]  I'm really bad about taking long questions, and I babble.
[00:50:29.919 --> 00:50:33.222]  I'm just going to let you have your say, kind of like radio graffiti, as some call it.
[00:50:34.203 --> 00:50:35.624]  I'm not even going to comment much.
[00:50:35.644 --> 00:50:36.905]  I'm just going to let you have your rant.
[00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:37.645]  Be ready.
[00:50:37.665 --> 00:50:37.906]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:38.026 --> 00:50:43.149]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:50.095]  A lot of days, Ron Paul says, I can definitely come on at this time, and then he always comes on, or sometimes something comes up, and then he has to reschedule.
[00:50:50.655 --> 00:50:52.777]  He may be popping in still in the next 40 minutes.
[00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:58.682]  So that might mess up some of those who want to call in, but barring him calling in during the calls we'll be taking, we'll be going to those.
[00:50:59.843 --> 00:51:05.287]  I'm going to take a break right now for the next five minutes and finish up some of my speech before the City Council in Austin four years ago.
[00:51:05.368 --> 00:51:12.534]  Back that up about 20 seconds for listeners out there, and we'll continue with how long ago we were warning everybody about the situation, and we'll come back.
[00:51:13.294 --> 00:51:20.320]  We'll take the next break in about four minutes, and then we'll come back and take your phone calls right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:20.801]  Stay with us.
[00:51:22.256 --> 00:51:36.540]  That makes me very angry and that's why it's so exciting that this council may simply just say we have a Bill of Rights and Constitution and we will not violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and in this city, America is still America.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.721]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[00:51:40.041 --> 00:51:42.982]  Now, I'm sure you heard about five years ago about the FBI Crime Lab.
[00:51:43.002 --> 00:51:46.623]  The head of it, Dr. Frederick Whitehurst, who I've interviewed several times, said, I'm not doing this anymore.
[00:51:46.643 --> 00:51:48.784]  We've been framing people, manufacturing evidence.
[00:51:48.924 --> 00:51:49.684]  This is out of control.
[00:51:51.658 --> 00:51:55.400]  I've interviewed FBI agent Tyrone Powers, who talked about how they would frame people.
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.561]  The different criminal things they would do.
[00:51:58.841 --> 00:52:00.202]  Tulea, Texas.
[00:52:00.222 --> 00:52:00.922]  56 black people.
[00:52:01.302 --> 00:52:02.143]  No criminal record.
[00:52:02.263 --> 00:52:03.303]  No drug paraphernalia.
[00:52:03.363 --> 00:52:03.863]  No nothing.
[00:52:04.163 --> 00:52:09.726]  On the word of one corrupt cop, gave them all 20 to 90 years in prison.
[00:52:10.746 --> 00:52:11.667]  Now you think about that.
[00:52:11.687 --> 00:52:13.467]  Houston Crime Lab.
[00:52:13.487 --> 00:52:16.829]  Thousands framed indiscriminately.
[00:52:18.049 --> 00:52:19.510]  The police chief had to admit it.
[00:52:19.986 --> 00:52:21.166]  Because his job's on the line.
[00:52:21.186 --> 00:52:23.227]  He's claiming, oh, I'm going to fix that problem.
[00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:28.568]  It's the equivalent of Herman Goering promising to stop what Hitler was up to.
[00:52:29.588 --> 00:52:31.429]  This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:31.689 --> 00:52:34.489]  So this is why we restrict the scope and size of government.
[00:52:34.729 --> 00:52:36.230]  And it's power over us and our lives.
[00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:37.990]  Because we know there's criminals on the street.
[00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:39.111]  We know there's bad people.
[00:52:39.251 --> 00:52:49.333]  But they don't have the massive mechanisms, the machinery of government, and military, and militarized police, and prison complexes to oppress at levels
[00:52:50.228 --> 00:52:51.029]  Never before seen.
[00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:54.632]  Last century, 200 million killed by government.
[00:52:55.012 --> 00:52:55.633]  200 million killed.
[00:52:55.913 --> 00:52:58.956]  Millions of American Indians, Native Americans, killed in this country.
[00:52:59.156 --> 00:53:10.306]  So don't tell me we shouldn't have a concern when the most draconian legislation in the history of the world, dwarfing Byzantine Spain and France, is rolled out against the people.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:27.422]  Now, I could list the crimes of the FBI, the Defense Department, state police, local police, all day long.
[00:53:27.742 --> 00:53:35.464]  My point is, history shows us that we must watch and we must control and we must limit powerful men.
[00:53:36.264 --> 00:53:39.705]  Because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:53:40.565 --> 00:53:44.166]  And I challenge members of this distinguished body
[00:53:44.798 --> 00:53:45.798]  To be part of history.
[00:53:45.818 --> 00:53:46.839]  To not abstain.
[00:53:47.219 --> 00:53:51.081]  To get out on the field, in your life, and you'll truly be alive.
[00:53:52.361 --> 00:53:54.782]  To not sell out to this corrupt system.
[00:53:56.263 --> 00:53:59.004]  You know, I spoke right before Ron Paul just a few weeks ago, right outside Austin.
[00:53:59.024 --> 00:54:08.388]  He talked about how his poll numbers just go up and up and up, and the support just gets greater and greater and greater as he resists all of this, and as he says no to this, and as he throws the lobbyist out of his office.
[00:54:08.969 --> 00:54:14.371]  The truth is, when the whole world's sold out, you guys are going to get more power out of not going with the system.
[00:54:15.131 --> 00:54:16.953]  This thing is in terminal velocity.
[00:54:18.794 --> 00:54:20.976]  This thing is falling down around itself.
[00:54:21.156 --> 00:54:25.099]  The corruption, the comprehensive annual financial reports, the scams.
[00:54:25.979 --> 00:54:28.181]  Now, I've got about nine minutes left.
[00:54:28.201 --> 00:54:30.863]  I'm going to try to go through these points because they're all very, very important.
[00:54:33.565 --> 00:54:40.851]  Section 213 of the First Patriot Act lets them break into your house or any business and take whatever they want or plant whatever they want and not tell you for six months they were there.
[00:54:41.091 --> 00:54:42.132]  And they're administrative.
[00:54:42.292 --> 00:54:43.173]  They're rubber stamps.
[00:54:44.238 --> 00:54:48.646]  They aren't for Billy Bob's house because we think he has this under the Fourth Amendment.
[00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:50.769]  They're for everybody.
[00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:52.232]  They're for whole classes of people.
[00:54:53.115 --> 00:54:58.858]  And now under the new Patriot Act, they have sections where they say, our officers need not even need these administrative subpoenas or warrants.
[00:54:59.038 --> 00:55:03.140]  They can just carte blanche, go anywhere they want for any crime or suspected crime.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:17.767]  And the spokesman for the Justice Department just a few months ago, after Ashcroft admitted, OK, there is a Patriot Act too, went before the House and Senate, and this was in the news, in the Associated Press, and said, well, yeah, we're going to use this in all crimes, all drug crimes, everything.
[00:55:18.087 --> 00:55:20.828]  Misdemeanors, third degree felonies, everything.
[00:55:20.969 --> 00:55:21.749]  That's on the record.
[00:55:23.127 --> 00:55:23.227]  U.S.
[00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:27.588]  attorneys, deputy attorneys, system attorneys, all these people, they're saying, yeah, we're going to use this for everything.
[00:55:28.108 --> 00:55:29.289]  They are using it for everything.
[00:55:29.469 --> 00:55:44.493]  The Victory Act, which is a continual salvo in this attack on the American people, clearly states that any possession of a controlled substance is an act of terrorism under Section 802, pointing back to that enacting clause.
[00:55:45.373 --> 00:55:46.333]  Well, it endangers human life.
[00:55:46.373 --> 00:55:47.553]  It's a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:55:47.894 --> 00:55:53.375]  They've actually got articles in the news about, oh yeah, they're charging people with weapons of mass destruction because they had marijuana.
[00:55:54.535 --> 00:55:55.695]  We don't want to be part of this.
[00:55:55.735 --> 00:55:56.655]  This is crazy!
[00:55:57.316 --> 00:55:58.976]  People disappearing in the middle of the night.
[00:55:58.996 --> 00:56:02.217]  I mean, what did Alexander Sholtsanitsa say in Gulag Archipelago?
[00:56:02.557 --> 00:56:09.318]  Oh, how we burned in the camps later, wishing that when the secret police went out at night to come to our doors, we would have met them.
[00:56:10.298 --> 00:56:13.799]  Met them downstairs with pokers and axes and daggers.
[00:56:27.637 --> 00:56:30.641]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:56:31.582 --> 00:56:34.365]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:37.529 --> 00:56:43.917]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:56:44.298 --> 00:56:45.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:56:46.932 --> 00:56:47.932]  But who is the enemy?
[00:56:48.453 --> 00:56:48.993]  Bin Laden.
[00:56:49.253 --> 00:56:50.253]  This is his ammo.
[00:56:50.274 --> 00:56:51.554]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:56:51.614 --> 00:56:53.295]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:56:53.615 --> 00:57:00.378]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:57:00.778 --> 00:57:01.198]  Some U.S.
[00:57:01.238 --> 00:57:06.921]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:57:07.601 --> 00:57:11.084]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:57:11.104 --> 00:57:21.352]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:57:21.572 --> 00:57:22.333]  Fabled enemies.

[00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:45.992]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:57:46.272 --> 00:57:52.774]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.

[00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:40.243]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:58:41.303 --> 00:58:50.230]  Did you know that the Rhodes Scholar was founded by Cecil Rhodes of England for the purpose of educating bright young men to learn to rule the world?
[00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:57.835]  He said in 1890 that within a hundred or so years there would be enough trained men that world government could be achieved.
[00:58:58.696 --> 00:59:02.559]  President Bill Clinton and several in his administration were Rhodes Scholars.
[00:59:03.159 --> 00:59:04.560]  Was Cecil Rhodes right?
[00:59:05.301 --> 00:59:07.102]  Are we approaching this world government?

[01:00:17.011 --> 01:00:18.072]  Who is that horseman?
[01:00:18.112 --> 01:00:18.812]  I think I know him.
[01:00:18.872 --> 01:00:20.213]  Minnie a young maid.
[01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:21.193]  Minnie a soldier.
[01:00:21.213 --> 01:00:22.133]  You are living history.
[01:00:22.153 --> 01:00:25.035]  Things are negative, but at the same time they're very positive.
[01:00:50.682 --> 01:00:54.444]  The New World Order is being revealed.
[01:00:54.904 --> 01:01:10.312]  And the millions of freedom-lovers who exposed the New World Order to so many, their credibility is rising right now.
[01:01:11.112 --> 01:01:13.073]  We were right.
[01:01:13.653 --> 01:01:18.155]  We were the watchmen and women on the wall.
[01:01:18.195 --> 01:01:18.756]  We were there.
[01:01:25.796 --> 01:01:26.576]  We're good to go.
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:59.451]  We told the truth.
[01:01:59.491 --> 01:02:00.713]  We didn't falter.
[01:02:15.905 --> 01:02:19.530]  One thing that never dies is the fame of a
[01:02:45.654 --> 01:02:50.937]  And those heroes will be back again, and again, and again.
[01:02:51.237 --> 01:02:55.658]  And I salute you all.
[01:02:55.779 --> 01:03:05.943]  All right, I'm going to go to Joel, George, Fred, Robert, Travis, and a few others if we have time.
[01:03:05.963 --> 01:03:07.743]  I want to recap the top stories today.
[01:03:07.803 --> 01:03:11.745]  Incredible developments that we have witnessed at the end on the economy.
[01:03:12.623 --> 01:03:20.746]  Before I do that, this show is made possible... And we're no longer live on prisonpanda.tv, right?
[01:03:21.246 --> 01:03:21.446]  Good.
[01:03:21.846 --> 01:03:27.328]  That was a pretty good rant I just did then, for the camera.
[01:03:27.508 --> 01:03:29.189]  Love fighting the new world order, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:30.209 --> 01:03:36.011]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about the great folks at Acola Bloom.
[01:03:37.205 --> 01:03:38.946]  It's an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[01:03:38.986 --> 01:03:41.247]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:03:41.307 --> 01:03:44.209]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride and limited water from the humidity in the air.
[01:03:44.629 --> 01:03:46.150]  Machine produces up to 28 liters in 24 hours, 7.5 gallons.
