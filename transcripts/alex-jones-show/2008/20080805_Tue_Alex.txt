[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:08.460]  Typically last ten.
[00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:10.243]  Ellen want is our guest.
[00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:15.910]  By the way, if a tree fell in the forest and nobody heard it fall, did it make a sound?
[00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:31.728]  Like, when we had Ron Paul on yesterday, out of the gates at the start of the show, our other big guest here, we randomly, throughout the four hour radio show every day, go live on the internet for PrisonPlanet.tv members with the video feed.
[00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:40.412]  We also then record that and post it within an hour to two hours after the show, depending on how long it takes to encode, for members to go watch at their leisure.
[00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.174]  Then you great guys and gals chop it up, put it on YouTube and everywhere else.
[00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:46.936]  Do great condensing down the info.
[00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:47.877]  We really appreciate it.
[00:00:48.478 --> 00:00:52.722]  Of course, there's also the free internet streams and higher quality at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:56.205]  And so we can catch up on some of the time today, getting Alan Watt on a bit late.
[00:00:56.486 --> 00:01:00.389]  I'm going to skip some of the breaks for InfoWars.com listeners.
[00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.852]  Those streams are separate from GCN Live.
[00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:06.175]  You'll need to move over to the InfoWars streams to hear some of the behind the scenes.
[00:01:06.596 --> 00:01:08.617]  Alan, you were on hold before we went to that break.
[00:01:09.238 --> 00:01:32.134]  Where I brought up how the public, when they watch television, it's admitted, they taught this in RTF, go into a dream state or a hypnotized state and that now studies show, and we've read these on air and you can go over them, I know you're an expert on this, that the public is more suggestible because of television and a lot of people are staying in this unconscious glazed over mode.
[00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:38.179]  What are we dealing with there and how did the scientific dictatorship implement this so cunningly?
[00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:57.809]  We've got to go back into the histories of the publications of some of the members of this world movement, like Huxley and others and Lord Veteran Russell, who talked about the whole notion of peace and how they defined peace.
[00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:12.412]  And that was to eliminate all conflict throughout the world, and that meant right down to male and female conflict, which meant that the separation of the family unit, the disintegration of the family unit even, was essential for world peace.
[00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:28.437]  But they also said that individualism had to be destroyed, and what that meant was they would have to target specific parts of the human brain, and those parts which gave you your self-preservation abilities, your perceptions,
[00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:33.089]  The same things that animals have, wild animals, that keeps them alive.
[00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:51.176]  And people like Arthur Kessler, who was a propagandist and a member of MI5, who wrote lots of novels and non-fiction books along this particular line, wrote one book called The Ghost in the Machine about the elimination of this part of the brain.
[00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:58.819]  And he mentioned how departments within the United Nations were working on methods to lobotomize this part of the brain
[00:02:59.582 --> 00:03:07.126]  And they tried different methods, including chemical lobotomization, viral attack through inoculation, and various other means.
[00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:09.587]  Now, they have done this, I am pretty certain.
[00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:22.374]  They've been pretty well successful with most people, and it was to be augmented again with the kind of technology that Brzezinski was talking about, technotronic era, in his book Between Two Ages.
[00:03:23.473 --> 00:03:39.360]  He talks about techniques used, scientific techniques, electronic devices, which would, and he meant from the basic units of television onwards up to literal ELF waves from towers affecting people's minds and eventually directing them.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.362]  He said eventually people won't know where their thoughts come from or where their opinions will come from.
[00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.052]  They'll be unable to think for themselves.
[00:03:47.072 --> 00:03:49.515]  They'll expect the media to do their reasoning for them.
[00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:10.432]  Yeah, well that ties in with a report that came out of Sweden from the Finnish newspapers, Finland, where a scientist there had
[00:04:27.848 --> 00:04:28.348]  Thank you.
[00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:52.385]  And without moving anything on that tower, they could target any individual within three feet.
[00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:56.646]  And this is all mainstream news, but people listening are laughing right now.
[00:04:56.926 --> 00:04:57.926]  Folks, it's 2008.
[00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.646]  This is Buck Rogers.
[00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:01.007]  Oh, it's here.
[00:05:01.307 --> 00:05:01.667]  It's here.
[00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:04.047]  And you can go through the airports now.
[00:05:04.107 --> 00:05:06.868]  They have camming lights, and they're also using this technology.
[00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:16.425]  And that was in AP three weeks ago.
[00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:19.848]  In fact, Chertoff had a big demonstration of it.
[00:05:20.328 --> 00:05:28.154]  And they're using passive MRI, which from a hundred feet away is scanning the brain, which they're now putting on the cell towers, as you mentioned.
[00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:30.115]  Everything Alan Watts says is documented.
[00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:34.018]  I have separately read it in mainstream news, everything he just said.
[00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.219]  Hidden in plain view.
[00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:37.081]  We'll come back, Alan, and I want you to
[00:05:37.842 --> 00:05:39.203]  You've got the total floor here.
[00:05:39.243 --> 00:05:41.586]  In fact, I'm gonna just sit back and listen.
[00:05:41.606 --> 00:05:42.927]  I'm gonna break down how they're doing this.
[00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:46.551]  But more importantly, why am I immune?
[00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:47.532]  Why are you immune?
[00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:49.274]  This stuff only enrages me.
[00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:51.857]  We're on the march.
[00:05:52.338 --> 00:05:53.960]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.564]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:36.324]  Will troops guard food supplies in the U.S.
[00:06:36.364 --> 00:06:36.804]  this winter?

[00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:16.868]  There is a scientific dictatorship.
[00:09:16.888 --> 00:09:22.031]  They've written hundreds of textbooks bragging how they're doing it all to us.
[00:09:22.672 --> 00:09:24.273]  Brain damaging us with mercury.
[00:09:25.813 --> 00:09:30.256]  Injecting us with different cancer viruses that are hormonally triggered, age triggered to kill you.
[00:09:31.597 --> 00:09:34.759]  And the cancer rates are going straight up.
[00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:43.784]  Every other disease, degenerative type of affliction is intensifying.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.462]  And it's being done scientifically by people playing God on huge power trips.
[00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:51.783]  And it's real.
[00:09:53.184 --> 00:09:54.084]  And it's happening now.
[00:09:54.164 --> 00:09:56.385]  So I was getting into how the public is mesmerized.
[00:09:56.425 --> 00:10:01.808]  How more and more they are in a Matrix-like condition.
[00:10:02.188 --> 00:10:04.709]  Their brainwaves are different.
[00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:05.830]  And now it's intensifying.
[00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.310]  I'm not bashing video games.
[00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.952]  I know big video game designers, a lot of them are big fans of the show.
[00:10:11.164 --> 00:10:22.292]  I've been stuck in a bunch of video games, you know, where the video games, you get to the final level of, you know, some of the most popular games, and they open the safe up, and it's my videos in the safe, the ultimate answer.
[00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:24.854]  I mean, just all sorts of craziness.
[00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:38.223]  But the point is, the video games, something about the added controlling the joystick with the not moving, and the intense focus, gets you into a lower than dream state, which is a natural state of near-death narcosis.
[00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:41.025]  And actually causes endorphins to flow.
[00:10:41.426 --> 00:10:43.787]  That's why these kids love 10, 15, 20 hours.
[00:10:43.807 --> 00:10:46.529]  I remember I had video games when I was a teenager.
[00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.051]  They were more primitive, but I remember a few Saturdays.
[00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:50.272]  I never got that heavy into them.
[00:10:50.732 --> 00:10:57.878]  Two, three hours would go by like that, and I'd be sitting there in a daze, but like in heaven, totally focused, going through all the levels.
[00:10:58.618 --> 00:11:01.701]  And later I saw the scientific reports that I was in a
[00:11:02.521 --> 00:11:05.243]  Artificially oxygen-starved narcosis.
[00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:08.945]  But that said, going back to Alan Watt.
[00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:10.045]  Alan, lay it out for us.
[00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:16.249]  Yeah, these techniques were... They copied a lot of this, actually, from the yogis of India.
[00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:16.989]  They studied them.
[00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:20.771]  They studied some of the top yogis in the 1800s and early 1900s.
[00:11:20.811 --> 00:11:24.514]  And did all the measurements on their body, and so on.
[00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:28.736]  They were intrigued by the guys who could go into these almost trance-like states, death-like states.
[00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:30.778]  Very, very shallow breathing.
[00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:36.708]  And they measured the oxygen content in their bloodstreams and how they survived, etc.
[00:11:36.988 --> 00:11:39.012]  But they also were measuring their brain patterns.
[00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:50.752]  And what they found, too, was that people in such brain pattern states could be very easily influenced and directed with outside information being pumped into them.
[00:11:51.312 --> 00:11:53.673]  You're easily led, you might say.
[00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:59.214]  Things would seem absurd to you in a fully conscious state, you'll take it at face value and accept it.
[00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.771]  We're good to go.
[00:12:12.236 --> 00:12:13.276]  for their military training.
[00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:24.041]  And they found the same thing that people who are trained in the more advanced games to kill on sight would actually do it in combat in the battlefield.
[00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:33.725]  And what they found too, when they did immediate tests on these particular soldiers who would kill, they found that the breathing rate was much shallower too, just like as though they were in the video game.
[00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:39.268]  So they're going into the same response mode in the battlefield as they were on the video game.
[00:12:40.106 --> 00:12:40.286]  POKEMON!
[00:12:58.257 --> 00:13:04.820]  Well documented, and we get that published in mainstream media, and then the public go and buy the game.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.861]  Let's explain again.
[00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:11.384]  Every time it would show, in what they admitted was a test, tens of thousands of children would collapse convulsing.
[00:13:11.984 --> 00:13:18.667]  The problem was, is they knocked their teeth out, or busted their, you know, their eyes, they got hurt, and so they quit doing it.
[00:13:18.727 --> 00:13:24.230]  But in a test, anytime they want, they can flick the switch and make you fall down on the ground convulsing.
[00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:25.407]  Mm-hmm.
[00:13:25.427 --> 00:13:28.549]  And what they found, too, with these games, you see, this isn't just the games.
[00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:36.533]  It's the parts of the brain that they want to target to alter behavior, mood, serotonin levels, etc.
[00:13:37.094 --> 00:13:39.955]  And it's the temporal lobe they were aiming for.
[00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:44.658]  The temporal lobe is very, very important if you want to control people.
[00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:49.180]  And the types of epilepsy that they were inducing was temporal lobe epilepsy.
[00:13:50.206 --> 00:14:00.269]  And where they go into a fugue state, and now people who have epilepsy will often get the initial fugue coming on them, where things seem unreal to them.
[00:14:01.569 --> 00:14:03.189]  They're moving in a surrealistic world.
[00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:11.732]  It's like a hallucination, or some people call them the quizzles, where they're in a sleepwalking state.
[00:14:13.292 --> 00:14:16.453]  And that happens before they go into the actual grand mal seizure.
[00:14:17.742 --> 00:14:21.826]  Yes, and they can have a fugue state again of complete amnesia when they come out of it.
[00:14:22.847 --> 00:14:28.592]  So, this is the same kind of thing that they're inducing by going for areas of the temporal lobe.
[00:14:28.932 --> 00:14:34.177]  Now, it's interesting too, they've got everyone addicted to cell phones, which also affect the temporal lobe.
[00:14:34.978 --> 00:14:36.339]  It's doing similar things there.
[00:14:36.539 --> 00:14:38.161]  People are mesmerized on these phones.
[00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:40.563]  They'll stand there and talk in street corners for hours and hours.
[00:14:40.643 --> 00:14:41.244]  Hours go by.
[00:14:41.872 --> 00:14:44.254]  And I'm going to stop you again just to back you up.
[00:14:44.815 --> 00:14:49.319]  I have seen, literally, I saw two or three today, thousands of university and government studies.
[00:14:49.379 --> 00:14:53.803]  I remember one about eight years ago because I had a buddy who was always on the cell phone.
[00:14:53.843 --> 00:14:55.344]  I noticed his behavior was changing.
[00:14:55.624 --> 00:14:58.427]  He was always on it for no reason, just jabbering.
[00:14:58.447 --> 00:15:00.529]  And before, he'd never been on the telephone.
[00:15:00.549 --> 00:15:01.329]  You couldn't keep him on it.
[00:15:01.349 --> 00:15:04.752]  And I remember reading that it raises the brain
[00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:14.801]  Up to three degrees in temperature, but any cell phone call for five minutes, even the ones that have lower emission, you get a one degree increase in brain temperature.
[00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:23.688]  And it went on to say that it is addictive and created opiate-like responses in the double-blind study.
[00:15:23.728 --> 00:15:24.608]  So I'm just backing up.
[00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:27.251]  What you're saying again is mainstream news.
[00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:32.415]  So there's nothing surprising to me about any of this.
[00:15:32.975 --> 00:15:33.836]  This is an agenda.
[00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:47.534]  People like Brzezinski, who was right in there with the NSA, published some of this stuff in his own books to do with controlling whole populations.
[00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:50.315]  And he said populations, not just individuals.
[00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.996]  And that this technology would be used.
[00:15:53.497 --> 00:15:59.399]  And prior to him in the 1950s, you find Lord Veteran Russell, who also worked for MI5 and 6,
[00:16:01.082 --> 00:16:14.889]  Um, publishing the same thing in his Impact of Science on Society book, where he mentioned that the techniques would be used that would bring whole populations to the conclusions and they'd have no idea that it was even being done to them.
[00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:20.652]  And he said eventually we'll be able to convince absolutely anyone of anything.
[00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:24.630]  I want to move forward from there historically, but let me digress.
[00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:39.918]  I wouldn't say you and I and many others are immune, but with any disease, with any program, there's always immune roaches to certain poisons, there's always plants that are immune, there's always people throughout history that are immune or resistant
[00:16:40.618 --> 00:16:43.719]  Well, I think the precursor that set up the whole field for this to work for the elite
[00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:09.778]  I think?
[00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:49.404]  And we find that there are people with different physiologies, and people who tend to have allergies, etc., can also divert toxins away from the brain that would normally be uptaken by the brain, and it would be diverted elsewhere, so they end up having sometimes problems, stomach gastric,
[00:17:50.164 --> 00:17:58.909]  Um, the problems, uh, lower bowel problems, stuff like that, where this stuff has been drawn to and has settled in, but it did not go to the brain.
[00:17:59.389 --> 00:18:03.472]  And I've found that with a lot of people who are really awake and have been most their lives.
[00:18:04.112 --> 00:18:07.554]  That's, I try to find the common denominators in them, and I talk to them.
[00:18:08.034 --> 00:18:14.438]  And that is one thing that a lot of them have are these, what seem simple allergies, but pretty persistent allergies.
[00:18:15.018 --> 00:18:20.522]  Well I mean you mentioned the first big insult before the mass programming begins at birth with the shots.
[00:18:20.903 --> 00:18:26.247]  When we were young we didn't get as many shots or no shots and I have seen that as a correlating factor.
[00:18:26.267 --> 00:18:27.408]  People in the country
[00:18:39.797 --> 00:18:40.498]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:18:40.518 --> 00:18:42.180]  I've had a lot of medical doctors on about this.
[00:18:42.341 --> 00:18:45.905]  One of them, Dr. Eisenstein, has one of the biggest practices in Illinois.
[00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:54.015]  I mean, out of over 100,000 Amish in just a three-county area, none of them have autism.
[00:18:54.856 --> 00:18:56.978]  None of them have any neurological problems.
[00:18:57.318 --> 00:19:02.241]  And then he did a study and looked at other studies around the country in Pennsylvania and other places where you have Amish.
[00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:03.402]  They don't have it.
[00:19:03.802 --> 00:19:04.483]  It isn't there.
[00:19:26.437 --> 00:19:32.062]  That's right, they did use a lot of children in the MKUltra test as well.
[00:19:32.082 --> 00:19:37.165]  It wasn't just adults, even though in the movie the CBC covered it, actually whitewashed more than they showed.
[00:19:38.286 --> 00:19:49.054]  And the reason a lot of children, they wiped out their memory to try to build a completely brand new personality that would be robot-like and very obedient and put them out into society and use them as spies, etc.
[00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:53.798]  So it's the vaccines are acting as the chemical lobotomy or as the electroshock?
[00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:55.833]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:19:56.174 --> 00:20:11.620]  Kessler talked about these tests being done back in the 50s and 60s and under the auspices of the United Nations and the different groups who are doing some of them like the Soviets were doing direct lobotomies, physical mechanical lobotomies.
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:17.002]  They're also doing that in the United States under the guys who work for the eugenics programs in the psychiatric institutions.
[00:20:18.047 --> 00:20:24.374]  And they were doing pre-frontal lobotomies to thousands of troops that came back into the U.S.
[00:20:25.115 --> 00:20:26.976]  after World War II and Korea.
[00:20:27.137 --> 00:20:32.883]  Have you ever seen the black and white films of them laughing and just jabbing an ice pick in the troops head and going and laughing?
[00:20:33.303 --> 00:20:37.067]  Laughing to the students going, watch this, as the guys chain down awake and they just go,
[00:20:38.393 --> 00:20:41.834]  I mean, it's the most bloodthirsty stuff you've ever seen with an ice pick.
[00:20:42.334 --> 00:20:49.456]  That's right, and even had traveling, they called him the mobile doctor who did the lobotomies on behalf of the U.S.
[00:20:49.496 --> 00:20:52.657]  government, and he did it out of the back of his van.
[00:20:53.717 --> 00:20:58.598]  This was high science, as they called it, and all they were doing was destroying the frontal cortex.
[00:20:58.838 --> 00:21:03.639]  Now that's where your behavior is altered, right in the frontal cortex.
[00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:06.040]  That's a definite behavior alteration right there.
[00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:14.508]  And you do become much more suggestible, very easily managed by authorities, because you have no confidence in your own decision-making powers afterwards.
[00:21:14.628 --> 00:21:26.277]  Well, all of this is really just a scientific codification of total war against our own species by aberrant psychopaths directing human development.
[00:21:26.677 --> 00:21:28.839]  And it isn't just that it's cold-blooded and they want the power.
[00:21:29.179 --> 00:21:36.085]  This is a literal wonderland to carry out all the horrors that are horrible to us, but that are beautiful to them.
[00:21:37.293 --> 00:21:37.753]  Absolutely.
[00:21:37.793 --> 00:21:41.776]  The public have no idea that war was declared upon them long ago.
[00:21:42.597 --> 00:21:43.197]  Total war.
[00:21:43.978 --> 00:21:52.243]  All-out war was declared upon every member of the common people, as they put it at the time.
[00:21:52.884 --> 00:21:58.808]  The commoners, they were afraid would outbreed them and eventually overthrow them and take over.
[00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:04.632]  And they claimed that the world would be in darkness because we're all too stupid to make good and proper decisions.
[00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:16.180]  So therefore the idea was they'd have to eliminate the common types, the inferior types that had not made it up the Darwinian scale into success and monetary success and business success.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.621]  It'd have to be eliminated.
[00:22:17.942 --> 00:22:20.846]  But of course, if they got wind of it, there could be an uprising.
[00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:22.368]  So they had to make a secret war.
[00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:31.326]  And it's not so secret today, it's out in the open under various guises that we must bring the population down one way or another.
[00:22:31.346 --> 00:22:36.092]  There's not enough food and all of the various crises they're creating.
[00:22:36.332 --> 00:22:39.016]  Now, that again was part of the plan back in the early 1900s.
[00:22:40.357 --> 00:22:42.759]  And adulterate, and adulterate, and adulterate the food.
[00:22:59.227 --> 00:23:00.568]  Adulterated, absolutely.
[00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:01.508]  The chemicals are in it.
[00:23:02.008 --> 00:23:04.609]  They're not there just for preserving the food.
[00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:06.350]  It's also to alter you.
[00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:11.652]  People have become terribly sick and the IQ has dropped over the last 50 years or so.
[00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:12.872]  And the sperm count?
[00:23:13.552 --> 00:23:15.253]  And the sperm count is way down as well.
[00:23:16.033 --> 00:23:18.294]  So none of this is by chance.
[00:23:18.414 --> 00:23:26.457]  And now they've admitted that there's a particular substance in soy which they pushed mightily back in the 60s and 70s as a substitute for meat.
[00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:28.420]  And had so many people go on it.
[00:23:28.921 --> 00:23:33.426]  Males who've been on it, their sperm count is down 70% lower than those who are not.
[00:23:34.056 --> 00:23:53.087]  And it also is now associated with breast cancer, but they tell women to eat it for breast cancer, and now... I mean, they're all getting breast cancer, and it's just the government will have all these big pageants and anti-cancer rallies with celebrities and everyone fighting it together, making it like some great... Ooh, you've got it too!
[00:23:53.387 --> 00:23:54.828]  Ooh, it's like having a cold!
[00:23:54.988 --> 00:23:55.848]  Oh, the government!
[00:23:56.168 --> 00:23:57.709]  Let's take more vaccines!
[00:23:58.089 --> 00:23:59.310]  They love us!
[00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.211]  And now,
[00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:03.814]  In the past they would just take troops out in a field and nerve gas them.
[00:24:04.354 --> 00:24:11.900]  Now it's getting widespread where I've been looking at the numbers and they're all calling me now going, yes, almost everybody's been in the military.
[00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:16.444]  When they hit about 45, they're getting the cancer now, even in families that never had cancer.
[00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:20.248]  But then even more, the troops are just dropping dead when they give them the shots.
[00:24:20.939 --> 00:24:21.119]  Mm-hmm.
[00:24:21.699 --> 00:24:29.861]  Yeah, and I've talked to some of them, too, and they phone me up when they come back, and they tell me they were given all kinds of medications, and they're not told what these medications were.
[00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:31.722]  They were told to open their mouths every morning.
[00:24:33.202 --> 00:24:35.443]  The sergeant comes along and pops these pills in their mouth.
[00:24:35.463 --> 00:24:37.583]  They make sure they swallow them, too.
[00:24:38.403 --> 00:24:41.344]  And these are all tests they're doing on different sections of the military.
[00:24:42.339 --> 00:24:44.359]  I'm sure it's going to affect their mind as well.
[00:24:44.379 --> 00:24:51.101]  They're trying to create this good killer robotic type soldier who will not suffer with flashbacks when he gets home.
[00:24:51.241 --> 00:24:58.642]  Well the head futurist, Dr. Marshall at the Pentagon said that in Wire Magazine as you know.
[00:24:59.122 --> 00:24:59.502]  That's right.
[00:25:00.502 --> 00:25:10.824]  So this is at the age where science is supposed to rule and dominate and all this began hundreds of years ago with the old alchemists, the fraternity of alchemy.
[00:25:11.644 --> 00:25:15.666]  Who said that they'd always keep advanced sciences to themselves.
[00:25:15.706 --> 00:25:17.066]  That was part of their oath.
[00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:25.449]  And by doing so, they'd take power over kings, queens, and governments, because those governments would need them to create the war machines.
[00:25:25.849 --> 00:25:32.512]  But ultimately, they would rule in what they called a logical manner, where the world would be run by the superior ones using logic.
[00:25:33.132 --> 00:25:52.713]  And to them they say, logically, Mike makes right, survival of the fittest, social Darwinism, and they point blank say in their books and thousands of different footnotes, we are going to build a worldwide control grid, we're going to kill 90 plus percent of you, and we're going to do it for the betterment of us.
[00:25:53.033 --> 00:25:54.315]  And to them that's logical.
[00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:57.932]  To them it is logical, and it justifies the means.
[00:25:57.972 --> 00:26:06.314]  I think it was Rockefeller said at the World Bank meeting that this generation are the cannon fodder for this particular agenda.
[00:26:06.974 --> 00:26:12.496]  And he said also that, he says, well you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
[00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:16.637]  So all the crisis you're going through in the last 50 years, the breakup of families,
[00:26:18.662 --> 00:26:21.905]  The incredible disruption in society, the drugs, etc.
[00:26:22.346 --> 00:26:26.150]  That's just what goes into making the omelette, and it's too bad it has to be done.
[00:26:27.873 --> 00:26:31.076]  That's just what has to be done, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:31.476 --> 00:26:35.019]  I'm going to skip this break for InfoWars.com audio stream listeners.
[00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:38.902]  You've got to go to that site to listen to those streams, the one on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:39.543 --> 00:26:43.346]  And then we're also streaming live on the web for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:26:43.366 --> 00:26:48.130]  You can see the document cam, the guest cam, the internet cam, and a lot more.
[00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:55.636]  So we will be right back in three minutes for everybody else, but for PrisonPlanet.tv members and folks, we're going to keep talking behind this break.
[00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:15.535]  Alan, I've got to tell you, I'm getting better and better with my guests, I'm interrupting, but every time you say something, I want to back it up with footnotes because I myself have verified it 20 other places and it just freaks me out because you're one of the few people that's done the same research I've done.
[00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:18.257]  How do we get this out to people?
[00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:21.420]  Because, I mean, this is a guaranteed fact
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.621]  Well, I've been putting this out for donkey's years, the same material.
[00:27:39.225 --> 00:27:41.767]  And I've given up on those who are gone.
[00:27:42.188 --> 00:27:47.232]  I got to look at the world as a world of survivors and casualties, and it's a war.
[00:27:47.572 --> 00:27:55.158]  And when you look at the casualties and you're in the war and you're helping to fight it, you can't be distracted by the casualties.
[00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:57.360]  That's how far gone we are.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:07.488]  We've got to realize that we don't have the time to wake up just occasional individual who's well under the New World Order's mind control.
[00:28:08.274 --> 00:28:17.979]  We've got to concentrate on a large audience and try and reach as many people as possible within that audience of individuals who are able to receive.
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:32.227]  Well, the incredible thing is, amongst the elite, there's not that many, maybe 5,000 or so that really have a big part of the plan in their mind, and even those are compartmentalized and think they're going to be the ones that are saved.
[00:28:34.708 --> 00:28:47.552]  I've had some of the elitist over the years, you know, off record, that's why I can't give us sources, but they've written about this too, say, well Alex, as you notice, you're telling them and they don't care, and we are in control, doesn't that show that we are the elite?
[00:28:47.932 --> 00:28:49.633]  And so we do deserve to be doing this?
[00:28:50.253 --> 00:28:53.954]  And in fact, that you see it, that means you might want to join us!
[00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:56.335]  That's their simple logic.
[00:28:57.155 --> 00:28:57.915]  Their simple logic.
[00:28:58.575 --> 00:28:59.936]  And they're stunned.
[00:29:01.023 --> 00:29:03.646]  And they put on a strange expression when you don't take their offer.
[00:29:03.666 --> 00:29:14.396]  They can't imagine why you could possibly hang on to what you're hanging on to for emotional reasons or personal emotional reasons or attachment to others.
[00:29:14.436 --> 00:29:17.019]  They can't understand why you don't take the bait or the bribe.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.381]  It's unbelievable.
[00:29:21.681 --> 00:29:23.623]  I mean, they are just cold-blooded killers.
[00:29:23.643 --> 00:29:25.684]  We're going to go back on the main transmission.
[00:29:25.704 --> 00:29:26.885]  I want to get into solutions.
[00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:32.409]  I understand you're saying they're casualties, but how does somebody with a loved one or somebody else break them out?
[00:29:33.325 --> 00:29:38.029]  You know, there's the classic archetypal image of the cold bucket of ice water being thrown on people.
[00:29:38.169 --> 00:29:46.095]  What is that real-world contextual way that you've found to try to break people out?
[00:29:46.115 --> 00:29:59.545]  I mean, I know with the programming that's built in that when you try to break them out, they fight back even more into a self-assured, self-satisfied little smile and spew, you know, pre-programmed memes back at you, but I want to talk about that with you right now.
[00:29:59.585 --> 00:29:59.845]  Here we go.
[00:30:03.661 --> 00:30:04.181]  Don't worry.
[00:30:04.621 --> 00:30:06.142]  This show is documented.
[00:30:06.642 --> 00:30:09.483]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.844 --> 00:30:13.305]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:30:13.325 --> 00:30:15.706]  I went down, down, down.
[00:30:16.066 --> 00:30:17.927]  And the flames went higher.
[00:30:18.387 --> 00:30:20.508]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:30:21.208 --> 00:30:22.729]  The ring of fire.
[00:30:23.609 --> 00:30:24.910]  The ring of fire.
[00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:31.413]  Yeah, the truth hurts, but not facing the truth is a lot worse.
[00:30:32.794 --> 00:30:34.895]  I indict the globalists.
[00:30:34.915 --> 00:30:40.999]  You know, they say through their social Darwinian system that if the public's dumb enough to be enslaved and dumbed down and poisoned, that's what they deserve.
[00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:46.642]  And I say to them that, you know, that's like saying, well, if a baby doesn't know how to feed itself, kill it.
[00:30:47.663 --> 00:30:52.005]  Like Dr. Peter Singer says, where old people are like mackerel, go ahead and kill them.
[00:30:52.745 --> 00:31:00.789]  We destroy who we are as humans when we don't empathize, when we don't take care of weaker, when we don't thrill at unlocking minds or teaching.
[00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:02.189]  I love teaching people.
[00:31:02.289 --> 00:31:02.950]  I love learning.
[00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.250]  I love showing people things.
[00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.251]  I love seeing things be built.
[00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:10.213]  I want the best in our species and to try to suppress
[00:31:11.293 --> 00:31:12.074]  the worst in us.
[00:31:12.114 --> 00:31:14.656]  Instead, the globalists say, no, order out of chaos.
[00:31:14.696 --> 00:31:22.562]  We'll play them off against each other, make them bestial, animalistic, dumb them down, play on their weakest factors.
[00:31:24.483 --> 00:31:40.195]  Your take on that, Alan Watt, and then solutions, I know you're saying they're all casualties of war, move on, but for friends, for family, for others, I have been able to unlock minds, but just with a frontal assault of shocking them, maybe like a big bucket of ice water, but what are some of your ideas there?
[00:31:41.198 --> 00:31:51.822]  Yeah, but the main problem with most people, they try and wake up the person next to them, generally a spouse or a relative, and that's where dissension comes in.
[00:31:52.463 --> 00:31:56.104]  And what generally happens, they overload them with too much at once.
[00:31:56.124 --> 00:32:03.287]  You've got to realize that you've moved on into a different realm of understanding, that person's still back there in a six o'clock news version.
[00:32:04.082 --> 00:32:06.123]  And you've got a head-on clash right away.
[00:32:06.163 --> 00:32:07.784]  You're talking an alien language to them.
[00:32:08.364 --> 00:32:11.206]  And they have been trained that if it isn't on television, it cannot be true.
[00:32:11.986 --> 00:32:17.329]  So, you have to, even with a presentation of evidence, they still go into a mind-lock.
[00:32:17.729 --> 00:32:22.151]  Because they do believe the media is going to tell them all the truths that they should know.
[00:32:22.432 --> 00:32:24.192]  They really believe that's the function of the media.
[00:32:24.212 --> 00:32:25.173]  They've been trained that way.
[00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:31.124]  And they have to go into a mind lock when you present them with facts and printed documentation and so on.
[00:32:31.725 --> 00:32:34.267]  And it takes a lot of time, just feeding them a little bit at a time.
[00:32:34.948 --> 00:32:38.671]  And so pick something which is contemporary, that is provable to them.
[00:32:39.292 --> 00:32:50.883]  Even the heavy aerial spraying we've had for 10 years, coupled with the changing weather, because they're creating this new weather phenomena, to convince us that we are the problem.
[00:32:51.463 --> 00:32:53.224]  However, they are doing it.
[00:32:53.265 --> 00:32:54.325]  You can see them doing it.
[00:32:54.385 --> 00:32:54.766]  You can breathe it.
[00:32:54.786 --> 00:32:56.247]  You can see them even creating a storm.
[00:32:56.927 --> 00:32:59.729]  And that's the kind of thing that you can show them immediately.
[00:32:59.749 --> 00:33:06.314]  That they must start using their own perceptions for the first time.
[00:33:06.394 --> 00:33:13.840]  And if they deny it, you can show them the Communist Chinese today clearing the air with different devices in Beijing.
[00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:36.802]  Expanding on that, you mentioned how they want to kill our propulsion or our self-preservation instinct because they say, ooh, that's too aggressive, that will be their impulse drive system to fight us and to have sovereignty and to defend their family and tribalism.
[00:33:37.202 --> 00:33:39.643]  Oh no, only our elitist tribalism is okay.
[00:33:40.004 --> 00:33:41.925]  We've got to neutralize that in them, and you're right.
[00:33:42.445 --> 00:33:52.090]  As Richard N. Haas, the head of the CFR says, modern environmentalism is about taking our survival drive and turning it against ourselves, making us the problem.
[00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:54.992]  So it's kind of a feedback loop, or like being electrocuted.
[00:33:55.832 --> 00:33:58.474]  We must get rid of humans to save the humans.
[00:33:58.554 --> 00:34:02.116]  So it makes our survival mechanism turn against itself
[00:34:02.876 --> 00:34:04.437]  Turn the gun against ourselves.
[00:34:04.777 --> 00:34:07.319]  Let's kill ourselves to save ourselves.
[00:34:07.739 --> 00:34:15.984]  Meanwhile, the globalists, as you said, with weather control, are doing things to the Earth to then stampede us into accepting that we're the problem.
[00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:19.967]  Yeah, there's the guy behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz.
[00:34:20.167 --> 00:34:20.908]  That's what they're doing.
[00:34:21.588 --> 00:34:25.991]  And they whistle in the wind and say nothing while the proof is in front of our faces if we care to look at it.
[00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.970]  All right, Alan Watt.
[00:34:28.531 --> 00:34:29.551]  We've been all over the map here.
[00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:38.816]  I want to get more into how somebody listening who's laughing right now, how we get them to realize they've been mesmerized by television, that they are in a dream setting, that they are hypnotized.
[00:34:39.496 --> 00:34:40.176]  Back in one minute.
[00:34:42.077 --> 00:34:43.418]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:34:50.623 --> 00:34:52.305]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:34:52.606 --> 00:34:56.030]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:34:56.211 --> 00:34:58.053]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:34:58.674 --> 00:35:01.398]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:05.503]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding.
[00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:05.783]  We're good.
[00:35:35.543 --> 00:35:37.643]  Exclusive audio interviews and so much more.
[00:35:37.944 --> 00:35:40.464]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[00:35:46.965 --> 00:35:48.386]  Bring down the new world order.
[00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:50.146]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:35:53.247 --> 00:35:55.167]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:35:55.627 --> 00:35:58.388]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:13.317 --> 00:36:31.531]  Your calls are coming up for Alan Watt in about 15 minutes, but Alan, continuing with the fact that we do have social architects with chemicals, with flickering screens, with semantical distortion, with the tactics of having six screens behind
[00:36:34.042 --> 00:36:41.187]  You have the CNN host, and then only your subconscious mind can take in all six screens, and he's in front of it talking, which is another feed.
[00:36:41.547 --> 00:37:02.262]  Then you have a scroll at the bottom, a blue mist in the corner, and then they teach in that high level of television, I mean, I talk to the producers, but it's also in textbooks, that that is meant to make you immediately go into subconscious mode, and I'm using that example because that's something that a bureaucrat listening right now, you know, laughing at us, or some cop, or somebody who thinks they're part of this system, when you're watching CNN tonight,
[00:37:03.615 --> 00:37:04.315]  Catch How You
[00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:35.298]  How and what?
[00:37:45.373 --> 00:37:46.714]  And so you're into alpha state.
[00:37:47.274 --> 00:37:49.555]  And when you're reading as well, you see the eye movements.
[00:37:49.695 --> 00:37:54.038]  You watch hypnotists, for instance, they love to use something which moves in front of your face.
[00:37:54.358 --> 00:38:00.861]  When your eyes are moving from left to right, left to right, as you read that screen, it's also aiding you to go into that hypnotic state.
[00:38:00.902 --> 00:38:02.743]  That's why the reading's at the bottom of the page.
[00:38:06.314 --> 00:38:13.416]  Well, I mean, I talk to the public and people say, oh, it's like they have glazed eyes and nobody talks to each other and they're obsessed with their little media device.
[00:38:13.836 --> 00:38:16.297]  That's because that's becoming the whole world.
[00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:23.899]  That little screen is connected to the eyes, which are just brain stalks, and it literally is an interface and they're being sucked into the matrix.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.160]  How long until
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:37.165]  You physically think they start inserting people into the racks, like they already do in Japan at night, in the major metropolis there in Tokyo, where people don't even go home, they just live in these racks.
[00:38:38.206 --> 00:38:42.948]  The military says they will be inserting us, by law, into the pods by 2025.
[00:38:43.168 --> 00:38:44.709]  You think it'll even take that long?
[00:38:45.553 --> 00:38:45.773]  No.
[00:38:46.034 --> 00:38:52.559]  In fact, there'll be a lot of people going into it voluntarily to begin with, which puts everyone at ease, thinking, I can go into it and come back out.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.102]  I can go in and play and come back out of it.
[00:38:55.162 --> 00:38:57.124]  That's the appeal to putting out to the public.
[00:38:57.964 --> 00:39:05.251]  And even at this stage of virtual reality games and so on, there are people who are now addicted to the other world.
[00:39:05.911 --> 00:39:09.655]  And they're getting treatment because they like the other world better than the real one.
[00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:10.679]  Thank you.
[00:39:24.765 --> 00:39:36.774]  They have the ability now to preach into the virtual reality, and the Pentagon has admitted, and I've read it on air from their own documentation, they have supercomputers set up with every individual pretty well on the planet.
[00:39:36.894 --> 00:39:43.839]  They have a duplicate of you with all your personal data, information, height structure, and so on, preferences, and all kinds.
[00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:52.586]  They call that the server in the sky, every person being tracked with the Google data, with the RFID, with the NSA, in live time, everything you're doing.
[00:39:53.266 --> 00:39:59.869]  And so they have a clone of you in the virtual world, which they claim they can put you into eventually.
[00:39:59.949 --> 00:40:10.694]  And one day, very shortly, and I've got a few articles in from professors just sent who claim that very shortly you'll be unable to tell if you're waking up in the virtual world or the real world.
[00:40:10.734 --> 00:40:12.015]  It'll be indistinguishable.
[00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:29.844]  But even without that high-tech system, when the average American is watching close to five hours of TV, two or three hours of video games, text messaging, we're already losing our humanity and being sucked into the matrix.
[00:40:31.045 --> 00:40:33.686]  We are, and it's all in preparation for it.
[00:40:33.786 --> 00:40:35.467]  Watch television now, it's very simplistic.
[00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:40.682]  You're talking about the media, the way the media is presented, the stories are presented.
[00:40:40.903 --> 00:40:42.203]  It's more simplistic than ever.
[00:40:42.303 --> 00:40:46.164]  It used to be a lot more persuading at one time to convince you.
[00:40:46.404 --> 00:40:47.065]  They don't have to.
[00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:50.626]  It's almost like a parent talking to a child in a little short speech.
[00:40:50.646 --> 00:40:52.746]  They're dumbing it down by design.
[00:40:52.806 --> 00:40:56.067]  Behind the scenes on the Infowars.com exclusive streams.
[00:40:56.087 --> 00:40:57.688]  We're going to be talking to Alan Watt.
[00:40:57.708 --> 00:40:59.228]  We'll be back for everybody else in three minutes.
[00:41:00.789 --> 00:41:02.950]  Alan, continue along that line.
[00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:03.570]  Continue.
[00:41:05.089 --> 00:41:06.891]  Yeah, this came from the Soviet system.
[00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:11.957]  You see, they used the Soviet system as a big laboratory, where people had basically no rights.
[00:41:12.298 --> 00:41:15.041]  And they used lots of political prisoners for experimentation.
[00:41:15.341 --> 00:41:16.683]  They had absolutely no rights.
[00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:17.922]  Thank you.
[00:41:37.097 --> 00:41:42.560]  Little black boxes in some of the top schools that put the children at ease and very calm.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:52.285]  They weren't agitated to sit and listen attentively and there was no hyperness whatsoever with the children with these scientific boxes that gave out ELF frequencies.
[00:41:52.685 --> 00:41:59.649]  This was all used there and now we're blended with the Soviet system as they said they'd do at the Reiss Commission.
[00:41:59.949 --> 00:42:05.012]  That was the function of the big foundation was to blend the Soviet system eventually, which they knew they were going to do.
[00:42:05.892 --> 00:42:14.378]  Into the American system, and that of the West, and use those techniques in an even higher level, to a higher degree, because the U.S.
[00:42:14.418 --> 00:42:22.063]  had the incredible tax bases to pull from, and funding, and institutions to work on these high-tech equipment.
[00:42:22.564 --> 00:42:23.444]  But we're seeing it now.
[00:42:23.464 --> 00:42:25.866]  This is the virtual world they want to bring us into.
[00:42:25.886 --> 00:42:29.788]  And even now, it's strange, you know, this is not crazy whatsoever.
[00:42:29.808 --> 00:42:31.950]  As you say, the Matrix movie was based upon
[00:42:32.677 --> 00:42:33.558]  I don't think so.
[00:42:41.488 --> 00:42:43.628]  They can take energy from the human body.
[00:42:43.989 --> 00:42:51.550]  They've even got new dance halls coming up with floors which will pick up the movements of the people above it.
[00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:58.651]  And each pound of the food or whatever, they can actually take energy from the movements of the human body.
[00:42:58.972 --> 00:43:00.592]  And that makes the whole dance floor.
[00:43:00.832 --> 00:43:02.172]  It lights it up and everything.
[00:43:02.792 --> 00:43:04.233]  So we are batteries.
[00:43:04.773 --> 00:43:06.953]  We will be batteries in this new system.
[00:43:07.053 --> 00:43:07.493]  Absolutely.
[00:43:07.733 --> 00:43:09.034]  And self-repairing batteries.
[00:43:09.054 --> 00:43:09.874]  We're very efficient.
[00:43:09.894 --> 00:43:11.094]  We're even better than machines.
[00:43:11.854 --> 00:43:13.196]  Absolutely.
[00:43:13.836 --> 00:43:21.664]  Continue.
[00:43:22.485 --> 00:43:27.109]  Well, you see, to most people, this seems shocking, but it's not shocking at all.
[00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:35.918]  As I say, they've got a virtual you, every one of you out there, in these super pentagon supercomputers, these Cray supercomputers.
[00:43:36.702 --> 00:43:43.355]  And all the data that you put out on the internet, all the stuff I collected from your censors, forums, etc.
[00:43:44.913 --> 00:43:50.777]  From all your banking forms, your habits, your purchasing habits, all the rest of it, you'll have a duplicate world in there.
[00:43:51.078 --> 00:43:53.540]  And they can predict pretty well your behavior patterns.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:59.084]  They've admitted that with the cell phones now, they've been... And that was always their big goal.
[00:43:59.104 --> 00:44:10.593]  50 years ago, the guy that invented the term 60 years ago, robot, Isaac Asimov, wrote about these new supercomputers that would track everything you did and then be able to predict the future off of that.
[00:44:10.633 --> 00:44:10.954]  Here we go.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:15.420]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.141]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:44:16.181 --> 00:44:28.797]  And just give me a fresh call list, John, from the top so I can get them all straight here.
[00:44:28.817 --> 00:44:30.860]  Your call's coming up in about five minutes.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.602]  We've been getting into this control grid.
[00:44:34.349 --> 00:44:44.796]  I see one weak spot in the New World Order structure being their own technicians, their own IT people, their own specialized individuals who are very intelligent.
[00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:54.564]  Who have been put on these power trips, who have been given great power, I see rebellion within their ranks and humanity springing eternal.
[00:44:54.584 --> 00:45:01.427]  I know they've carefully screened them and also carefully watched their own people, but I do see continual leaks from them.
[00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:09.852]  They're not omnipresent, they're not all-powerful, they're trying to have this ultimate final revolution against humanity, an ultimate tyranny that can't be defeated in their own words.
[00:45:10.752 --> 00:45:17.777]  But I see a great weak spot being their own people leaking information, sabotaging them, bringing information out.
[00:45:18.617 --> 00:45:22.400]  Because I talk to people in Hollywood, people in government, high level, they know what's going on.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.160]  They're upset.
[00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:24.341]  They don't like it.
[00:45:25.102 --> 00:45:31.086]  They talk about how it's closed systems, how the inner party of the New World Order is some of the most oppressed people of any group.
[00:45:31.526 --> 00:45:33.687]  I mean, do you think that's an area?
[00:45:33.708 --> 00:45:39.471]  I mean, obviously resistance springs from the grassroots, the middle class, but what about from elite circles?
[00:45:40.912 --> 00:45:49.661]  From Lietzikows themselves, and for those who have been very good faithful servants to bring all this about, you'll find it just isn't the Soviet system.
[00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:56.287]  For every person who was a bureaucrat or a scientist, they were more heavily monitored on a daily basis than the average citizen.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.722]  Because the elite must be sure of them first and what they're doing.
[00:45:59.742 --> 00:46:03.544]  If they get loose tongues somewhere, they're simply eliminated.
[00:46:03.584 --> 00:46:07.046]  And I think we'll find more and more suicides as time goes on.
[00:46:07.066 --> 00:46:14.791]  That's how we present it to the public, with a higher number of bureaucrats or scientists.
[00:46:15.311 --> 00:46:20.254]  Because it's been found that they're becoming loose-tongued, because they're worried about their own lives.
[00:46:20.294 --> 00:46:21.134]  They know too much.
[00:46:21.194 --> 00:46:26.237]  They know that eventually their own function will be over, and they will also be eliminated.
[00:46:26.257 --> 00:46:34.862]  So they start to panic and talk to close friends, and they don't realize they're being monitored more heavily than the average individual or citizen in the street.
[00:46:35.542 --> 00:46:38.202]  That's how the Soviets did it, and that's how we're doing it here, too.
[00:46:38.543 --> 00:46:39.003]  Exactly.
[00:46:39.083 --> 00:46:55.845]  With this whole science, there's a million different ways they do this, but to get their, say, FBI or Secret Service, they found the FBI to fight the mob, it's instantly corrupted with the mob, so out of the gates, and of course the government made alcohol illegal for those ten years, it later came out, to corrupt the federal police.
[00:46:56.406 --> 00:47:03.947]  Then they say, oh, we're fighting communists, we've got to cut corners for America, they get them compromised, they commit all this evil, and then now today,
[00:47:04.787 --> 00:47:12.352]  Yeah, the low-level FBI is just investigating petty crimes, but at the top, these are a sinister army of murderers and killers and drug dealers.
[00:47:12.812 --> 00:47:15.093]  Same thing with the DEA and the CIA.
[00:47:16.735 --> 00:47:25.040]  You see these guys, you go to events, you talk to them, and you say, you know they're killing the troops for the cancer viruses, you know they're giving it to the public.
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:34.083]  I've even, you know, seen Globulus, whose daughters have died of cancer when they're ten, I'll say, you know, you know that's killing you, and they just kind of look at you and, you know, well that's the way it is.
[00:47:34.703 --> 00:47:45.187]  So I guess it's also, kind of like O'Brien says in 1984, because Orwell really lived through all that, Eric Blair had, that O'Brien says, I'll be smashed, I'll be destroyed, I'll be tortured and killed.
[00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:47.588]  Oh, I love it, it's the strength of the evil system.
[00:47:47.908 --> 00:47:51.389]  I live on in this system that's just meant to tear humans apart.
[00:47:52.352 --> 00:47:52.572]  Yeah.
[00:47:53.212 --> 00:48:07.056]  But what you also find, and this is what they found with Adolf Hitler and those who loved Stalin, during the Nuremberg Trials with Hitler, all the officers who were on trial glorified Hitler to the bitter end.
[00:48:07.697 --> 00:48:11.718]  And of course, the conclusions they come to, they all had psychopathic-type natures.
[00:48:12.498 --> 00:48:17.119]  Within the psychopath, there's a sadomasochism that's very, very obvious.
[00:48:20.257 --> 00:48:27.543]  They despise the inferiors beneath them in rank, but they glory in the power of those above them.
[00:48:27.903 --> 00:48:32.346]  They worship power, and so they worship those above them to the bitter end.
[00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:38.511]  And that's also the structure you have in the scientific and bureaucratic elite that runs the world today.
[00:48:38.871 --> 00:48:41.633]  They glorify the ones above them for having so much power.
[00:48:42.034 --> 00:48:46.177]  It's hard for a non-psychopath to understand you cannot get into their mindset.
[00:48:46.897 --> 00:48:48.417]  But that's what works with them.
[00:48:48.917 --> 00:48:56.259]  The lust and the craving, and an awful craving for total power, and they worship those who have it above them.
[00:48:56.459 --> 00:48:57.159]  And that's what it is.
[00:48:57.199 --> 00:49:16.504]  When you look at Bush and people on a podium, or you look at a Bilderberg group meeting photo or video, they are all looking at each other lustfully, and then Bill Clinton, even in front of George Bush Sr., will, in front of everyone, not saying why he's doing it, he will just bow to him, and then they all just fro, yes, power!
[00:49:16.684 --> 00:49:17.966]  Oh, yes!
[00:49:18.627 --> 00:49:21.131]  And they love the power of children dying of cancer.
[00:49:21.331 --> 00:49:23.194]  They love the power of killing the troops.
[00:49:23.455 --> 00:49:27.781]  And they love the fact that the police worship them while they're giving their cancer virus injections.
[00:49:28.022 --> 00:49:28.763]  They just love it.
[00:49:28.803 --> 00:49:30.766]  Oh, look at them loving me while I kill them.
[00:49:31.006 --> 00:49:31.928]  It's so sick!
[00:49:32.268 --> 00:49:34.510]  Look at them worshipping us as we kill them!
[00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.291]  Look at the public loving us after!
[00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:45.058]  I mean, Bush, if you watch him on the pile with the bullhorn, he's just getting this sick, evil look, and you can just see him just loving the firemen crying and worshipping him.
[00:49:45.218 --> 00:49:47.600]  He's thinking, look at these scumbag bastards!
[00:49:48.241 --> 00:49:51.003]  Ah, just look at how I've killed a bunch of them, and they love it!
[00:49:51.203 --> 00:49:52.805]  I mean, he's feeding right there!
[00:49:53.485 --> 00:49:53.645]  Yes.
[00:49:53.985 --> 00:49:54.646]  Well, there's no doubt.
[00:49:54.706 --> 00:49:59.430]  I mean, that statement that Brzezinski made to one of the major magazines in an interview,
[00:50:00.174 --> 00:50:00.434]  We're good.
[00:50:18.342 --> 00:50:21.323]  Well, that's like in the book Kiss the Boys Goodbye.
[00:50:21.343 --> 00:50:27.565]  I mean, Kissinger wrote himself, the military are dumb, pathetic animals to be used up as cannon fodder.
[00:50:27.765 --> 00:50:29.045]  And they just go, Yes sir!
[00:50:29.145 --> 00:50:29.985]  Murder me!
[00:50:30.265 --> 00:50:31.166]  Kill America!
[00:50:31.326 --> 00:50:32.026]  I love it!
[00:50:32.526 --> 00:50:33.326]  Yes sir!
[00:50:35.107 --> 00:50:35.487]  Yep.
[00:50:35.647 --> 00:50:37.687]  That's a name in the game in the psychopath's world.
[00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:39.888]  And that's why they have these amazing
[00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:52.439]  This incredible protection that occasionally lets them down and lets out their sexual strangeness that they all have because they are all sadomasochistic in every way in the bedroom as well.
[00:50:53.493 --> 00:50:58.975]  You know, like, I don't like pain, and to me that's bizarre and weird, but they love being humiliated.
[00:50:58.995 --> 00:51:11.599]  I mean, I don't want to get into what they do, but it's admitted with Hitler, and they're always catching British lords having the same thing done, and they love to be beaten, they love to have crap smeared all over them, and they're going to do that to us, folks!
[00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:15.700]  See, that's their love for us, is brutalizing us and crapping on us.
[00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:17.551]  Yes, yes.
[00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:27.379]  And, you know, even David Suzuki, who is one of the leaders and proponents, he said on national television in Canada, we've got to kill off, I think it was 140,000 a day to save the world.
[00:51:28.099 --> 00:51:34.364]  The guy who loves very little animals, but who is a geneticist, who works for the World Wildlife Fund and the United Nations.
[00:51:35.245 --> 00:51:38.728]  In one of his early lectures, he says, we're all just fruit flies.
[00:51:38.808 --> 00:51:40.269]  And he was into breeding fruit flies.
[00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.611]  He says, that's all people are, they're fruit flies.
[00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.391]  Well, here's the point I want to get your take on.
[00:51:44.411 --> 00:51:49.736]  We're going to break and take calls, but we're actually going to skip this break for InfoWars.com listeners, because it's too important.
[00:51:52.278 --> 00:51:55.740]  I keep making a big deal out of this, and it's in my film, Endgame, because it is a big deal.
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.221]  It's the key.
[00:51:57.645 --> 00:52:10.302]  Two different newspapers reported, and I've been at similar events, when they talk about, when Dr. Eric Pianco talked about, we've got to kill 90% of the public, my wife and my family, we're all ready to die.
[00:52:10.862 --> 00:52:14.407]  He projected a giant PowerPoint of skulls with a red filter.
[00:52:15.308 --> 00:52:20.130]  And the newspapers described raptured three-minute standing ovations.
[00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:24.451]  Every time he said, kill everybody, 95% standing ovations.
[00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:25.211]  And that's the point.
[00:52:25.792 --> 00:52:29.093]  And they all, I mean, you go look at every case.
[00:52:29.233 --> 00:52:33.194]  I mean, I've had his graduate students, who are now doctors, send me threatening emails.
[00:52:33.254 --> 00:52:36.375]  And I check their MySpace, I check their professional pages.
[00:52:36.795 --> 00:52:39.636]  They're all in bioweapons or bioweapons research.
[00:52:39.976 --> 00:52:42.137]  And now they've moved this cult of killers
[00:52:42.757 --> 00:52:48.059]  End of the new 36 level 4 bioweapons laboratories that are all based in major cities.
[00:52:49.459 --> 00:52:52.380]  And they're all just, yes, we're going to murder you.
[00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.301]  It's beautiful for Earth.
[00:52:54.841 --> 00:53:00.423]  My family, I'm ready to take the bioweapons home and release it on my family first.
[00:53:00.863 --> 00:53:03.484]  And then it's like, oh, you're so beautiful how you're going to die.
[00:53:04.004 --> 00:53:05.905]  Oh, it's, I mean, and they catch PETA.
[00:53:06.445 --> 00:53:08.746]  And I reported this years before it came out because I know Spike was in it.
[00:53:09.106 --> 00:53:17.288]  Goes and gets dogs from the pound and then they sit in there eating hamburgers and rolling around on tables injecting dogs and cats with poison, killing them.
[00:53:17.328 --> 00:53:18.089]  I told you that.
[00:53:18.769 --> 00:53:20.509]  Okay, folks, and then it came out in the news.
[00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:22.790]  I mean, they're psychos!
[00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:23.530]  Do you understand?
[00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.711]  Psycho killers run it all!
[00:53:26.471 --> 00:53:27.691]  Yeah, even Skinner.
[00:53:27.711 --> 00:53:36.754]  There's videotapes of Skinner and others actually dropping fairly newborn babies from a foot or a foot and a half high to see how they react when they hit a table.
[00:53:37.134 --> 00:53:38.695]  I mean, that's what they are.
[00:53:38.775 --> 00:53:42.916]  These people are utter psychopaths and we better understand that quickly.
[00:53:43.516 --> 00:53:44.156]  Very quickly.
[00:53:44.236 --> 00:53:57.141]  And the whole world is being built into an amusement park for the elite to cram us through meat grinders, slit throats, rape children, buy a weapon, because they think death and piles of maggot-covered bodies are beautiful.
[00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:00.902]  I mean, John Wayne Gacy, the rest of them, they loved maggots.
[00:54:01.142 --> 00:54:02.543]  They loved rotten flesh.
[00:54:02.843 --> 00:54:04.303]  They loved torturing people.
[00:54:04.603 --> 00:54:06.504]  And you're going to find out, folks, that's who runs it.
[00:54:06.824 --> 00:54:11.546]  Troops, when you're dying from the shots they give you, remember, they're enjoying killing you.
[00:54:14.136 --> 00:54:16.998]  And they get off on the fact that the public never catch on to it.
[00:54:17.038 --> 00:54:18.579]  See, that's the big joke amongst them.
[00:54:19.059 --> 00:54:25.964]  They get off on the fact that the public go along with everything that they want us to go along with.
[00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:32.328]  We must acquiesce to every part of their plan, and we do it by silence and acceptance.
[00:54:32.768 --> 00:54:35.310]  And they laugh at us for doing so, as dumb animals.
[00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:36.871]  I know, and I just can't stand it.
[00:54:38.052 --> 00:54:39.353]  God, I can't stand it, Alan.
[00:54:39.393 --> 00:54:42.675]  I mean, I know you say it's casualties of war, gotta move on, but
[00:54:44.528 --> 00:54:53.012]  I can't believe a bunch of spindly-necked, pot-bellied pedophiles who love dead bodies and love torture and black uniforms run the planet.
[00:54:53.673 --> 00:54:53.813]  Yes.
[00:54:54.173 --> 00:54:57.775]  I mean, I just can't believe what humanity could do if they weren't holding us back.
[00:54:59.096 --> 00:54:59.836]  That's just it.
[00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:09.641]  And even some of those involved, like Lenin, who was well-trained by the big bankers to do his role, who said communism is the new, it won't last 70 years, and he was right on.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:10.940]  I don't know.
[00:55:27.865 --> 00:55:29.366]  Look at the industry of man.
[00:55:29.946 --> 00:55:37.048]  Look at all the waste of tax money and all their big projects which enslave us through technology and research and development.
[00:55:37.428 --> 00:55:47.792]  If that had gone to all the right causes, we truly could have one incredible world here and we wouldn't have all the ills that we have today caused by these psychopaths who run us today.
[00:55:48.112 --> 00:55:49.913]  And they always drill into us.
[00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:51.514]  It's evolution.
[00:55:51.554 --> 00:55:52.135]  It's set.
[00:55:52.195 --> 00:55:53.216]  You don't have free will.
[00:55:53.496 --> 00:55:58.279]  No, it's because they know you have free will and they don't want you taking hold of real human destiny.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.161]  We're going to keep talking right now.
[00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:02.122]  Allen, four minutes.
[00:56:02.522 --> 00:56:03.863]  You've got the floor to talk about whatever you want.
[00:56:03.883 --> 00:56:05.184]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[00:56:06.065 --> 00:56:13.450]  Well, you know, if you ever study pedophilia, pedophiles, for instance, are again, sadomasochists, but generally sadists.
[00:56:15.547 --> 00:56:20.529]  When they're questioned, when they're caught, they will often say that the child wanted this to happen.
[00:56:20.569 --> 00:56:24.631]  No matter how grotesque the actions were, they'll blame the victim.
[00:56:25.352 --> 00:56:28.293]  And that's standard what the abuser does to the victim.
[00:56:28.333 --> 00:56:32.775]  They blame the victim for what happened, including themselves getting caught.
[00:56:34.165 --> 00:56:35.546]  And they'll hate the victim for that.
[00:56:35.927 --> 00:56:38.729]  Now, they've created a system of abuse in the world.
[00:56:38.849 --> 00:56:39.990]  It's an abusive system.
[00:56:40.531 --> 00:56:43.673]  And the public are trained to go back to the abuser for help.
[00:56:44.194 --> 00:56:48.778]  When the problems brought on by the abuser affect them, that's how the system is.
[00:56:49.278 --> 00:56:52.641]  The public are trained to cry, you must help us do something.
[00:56:53.002 --> 00:56:58.887]  And the abuser smiles and grins and says, well, okay, we'll see what we can do, but it's going to cost you.
[00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:01.093]  And we better get that through our heads.
[00:57:01.553 --> 00:57:04.974]  Stop going back to the abuser because they will not fix your problems.
[00:57:04.994 --> 00:57:06.534]  They've caused your problems.
[00:57:06.995 --> 00:57:10.275]  And we're simply doing exactly as they predicted we would do.
[00:57:10.295 --> 00:57:19.897]  I've got to understand the behavior patterns here in the mind of the pseudo masochist psychopath who runs the planet.
[00:57:21.678 --> 00:57:22.218]  Or we're doomed.
[00:57:23.266 --> 00:57:25.607]  Acquiescence to everything is the plan.
[00:57:25.667 --> 00:57:27.427]  We acquiesce to all their demands.
[00:57:27.507 --> 00:57:29.888]  Look what's happening in airports and everywhere else in the world.
[00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:33.569]  We're watching the total destruction of freedom.
[00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:44.173]  All the rights that were fought for over many, many centuries have been taken away over the last few years under this absolute absurd notion of terrorism.
[00:57:44.953 --> 00:57:50.355]  And terrorism had nothing to do with it until you realized, to the elite, we are all the terrorists, you see.
[00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:55.477]  Any individual with a thinking mind who understands what's going on is a terrorist.
[00:57:56.179 --> 00:58:01.708]  Any person who says, I'm not going along with this agenda of genocide is a terrorist.
[00:58:02.307 --> 00:58:03.207]  We're all terrorists.
[00:58:03.588 --> 00:58:08.950]  If you want to get married and have children and pick your own mates, you are a terrorist.
[00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.071]  That's not to be allowed in the near future.
[00:58:11.091 --> 00:58:18.015]  The young children at school are being taught right now to even volunteer themselves for sterility to save the world.
[00:58:18.455 --> 00:58:20.696]  And there's even some come forward to do that.
[00:58:20.776 --> 00:58:22.217]  I said that would happen 16, 17 years ago.
[00:58:22.297 --> 00:58:22.717]  It's happening.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:30.101]  When you read their agenda, which they publish copiously, you know what they're going to do next.
[00:58:30.781 --> 00:58:31.642]  It's quite simple.
[00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:42.584]  But you've got to get off that mainstream television, away from the talking professional liars that are well-paid to lie to you, and start thinking for yourself, and talking to each other.
[00:58:43.044 --> 00:58:51.186]  When television first came in, it didn't just separate people from talking within the community, it stopped everyone in the household from talking to each
[00:58:51.486 --> 00:58:52.627]  Well, look where you set it.
[00:58:52.647 --> 00:58:54.068]  You set it at the center of the living room.
[00:58:54.268 --> 00:58:55.550]  Everybody's focused on it.
[00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:57.551]  It becomes the center of daily life.
[00:58:58.652 --> 00:58:59.172]  Absolutely.
[00:58:59.713 --> 00:59:03.536]  And it destroyed... You know, in Britain, there was a campaign.
[00:59:03.616 --> 00:59:06.839]  In Britain, most of the bars there were run by two or three big chains.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.761]  And people used to go into the bar.
[00:59:09.801 --> 00:59:12.123]  That was a community place where everyone talked.
[00:59:13.311 --> 00:59:14.752]  Now you go in a bar and they all want to watch TV.
[00:59:43.351 --> 00:59:47.674]  This is the massive social engineering, and we have to get people to break out of it.
[00:59:47.715 --> 00:59:58.823]  You start by not watching the mainstream television, by cutting it down to almost nothing, not letting your children watch it, by not eating GMO food, by not having cell phones, by getting your children out of public schools.
[00:59:59.183 --> 01:00:00.084]  We're coming back live.
[01:00:05.028 --> 01:00:09.471]  Alright, David, David, Alan, Bill, and many others, we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:15.794]  David in Canada, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:18.235]  How you doing?
[01:00:18.475 --> 01:00:18.735]  Good.
[01:00:19.075 --> 01:00:19.375]  Hello?
[01:00:19.655 --> 01:00:19.935]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:23.476]  Yeah, it sounded like my phone was about to be clipped there.
[01:00:23.496 --> 01:00:34.019]  I spoke to you on May 19th and you wanted me to send you some additional information about me fighting the power structure and how I was held in custody for eight years on fabricated charges.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.881]  You call a lot of shows, yeah, and talk about how you're locked up somewhere.
[01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:38.801]  How can we help you?
[01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:48.199]  Yeah, well, what I want to do is tell you that when people try to fight the system, um, that they basically turn into boat rockers and they get thrown overboard.
[01:00:48.739 --> 01:00:56.903]  I've had numerous people that try to come forward to help me that have had, uh, calamities in their own lives and, you know, family members die and things like that.
[01:00:56.983 --> 01:01:01.245]  So, what happens is people turn into what I call sand heads.
[01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:07.849]  They tend to bury their heads deeper into the sand because they're too afraid of what's going on and they figure they can't do anything about it.
[01:01:08.689 --> 01:01:16.635]  And you virtually can't do anything about it because they have so much power that they use shows like this to find out who the dissidents are.
[01:01:16.795 --> 01:01:19.317]  So we might as well give up and not even do radio shows.
[01:01:19.397 --> 01:01:21.099]  Look, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:01:21.159 --> 01:01:25.622]  You call every show continually and then you always bad-mouth the shows.
[01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:28.104]  I don't know what you want or what you're talking about.
[01:01:28.565 --> 01:01:30.066]  I'm giving you things to do.
[01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:31.907]  Stop eating GMO food.
[01:01:31.967 --> 01:01:33.188]  Stop using cell phones.
[01:01:33.228 --> 01:01:34.408]  Get out of public schools.
[01:01:34.808 --> 01:01:35.969]  Stop watching TV.
[01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:37.470]  Get to know your neighbors.
[01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:39.471]  Find out what's happening.
[01:01:39.511 --> 01:01:42.473]  I mean, we're here trying to talk about solutions.
[01:01:42.593 --> 01:01:51.158]  And since we're one of the only places where people can have a say, then we get attacked because people are just clawing at each other like trying to save a drowning man.
[01:01:51.238 --> 01:01:51.738]  Alan Watt?
[01:01:52.819 --> 01:01:53.739]  Yeah, there's no doubt.
[01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:58.682]  I mean, when you cannot voice what's happening, it truly would be game over.
[01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:04.314]  And we have to see what's happening and warn what can happen if the people don't stop now.
[01:02:05.134 --> 01:02:08.776]  We know that every device they give us in technology is to serve them.
[01:02:10.157 --> 01:02:11.197]  That's a given.
[01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:25.165]  Years after they gave us one, even a cell phone, then they tell you, we've been tracking you from the beginning and finding out who all your friends are to get your modes of behavior and to see if their modes of behavior coincide with yours, etc., etc.
[01:02:25.205 --> 01:02:27.186]  It's all studies, studies, studies, and data.
[01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:29.639]  But we know that they're getting smaller and smaller.
[01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:34.621]  These units can do more and more and eventually be so small that they'll be dysfunctional.
[01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:39.143]  And the children will then be presented with the chip, the interfacing chip.
[01:02:39.483 --> 01:02:40.984]  That's where it's supposed to go to.
[01:02:41.004 --> 01:02:44.686]  And I think now parents got to start with their children and start telling them.
[01:02:45.385 --> 01:02:47.007]  Look, this is fascinating you.
[01:02:47.027 --> 01:02:48.848]  It's designed to fascinate you.
[01:02:49.068 --> 01:02:56.475]  You've got to draw the line now and they're already like in Time magazine for kids and two different issues saying your parents said this aren't cool.
[01:02:56.876 --> 01:02:58.457]  They don't want you to have the chip.
[01:02:58.477 --> 01:02:59.518]  Rebel and get it.
[01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:05.223]  You've got to explain to your children they're taking their natural rebellion and trying to turn that against the family.
[01:03:05.483 --> 01:03:06.685]  You've got to early on
[01:03:07.285 --> 01:03:09.746]  That's right, and some countries have admitted that already.
[01:03:27.759 --> 01:03:30.040]  Italy, for one, has banned homeschooling.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:35.523]  Well, not homeschooling, they've actually wanted all children... Well, California's announcing it, but people aren't just going along with it.
[01:03:36.023 --> 01:03:43.306]  Yeah, and Hillary Clinton said that if she got in, she'd also ban all homeschooling, because they must have everyone, and I've said this, in the system.
[01:03:43.426 --> 01:03:44.287]  The one system.
[01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:45.268]  David in Texas.
[01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:45.488]  Go ahead.
[01:03:45.568 --> 01:03:45.728]  David.
[01:03:59.804 --> 01:04:01.384]  David in Texas here on the air with Alan Wong.
[01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:01.685]  Go ahead.
[01:04:01.965 --> 01:04:03.405]  Yeah guys, great show today.
[01:04:03.745 --> 01:04:04.325]  Pretty intense.
[01:04:04.785 --> 01:04:06.086]  Two questions, make them quick.
[01:04:06.186 --> 01:04:11.147]  The first question, y'all brought up the soy milk and that it might not necessarily be good for you, lower sperm count.
[01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:13.908]  Is that true even with the organic soy milk?
[01:04:13.928 --> 01:04:14.068]  Yes.
[01:04:14.128 --> 01:04:17.109]  I quit drinking regular milk because it had all the hormones and crap in it.
[01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:20.030]  But now I'm hearing, you know, that the soy milk isn't good for me.
[01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:25.474]  Any staple they push is going to be bad in some way to hurt you.
[01:04:25.514 --> 01:04:26.655]  This is total war.
[01:04:27.236 --> 01:04:34.202]  Understand, what they do is they are, with all your major soy milks, they are crushing it up and reducing it down with the cores.
[01:04:34.242 --> 01:04:43.991]  Now even the meat of the soybean, even the flesh of the soybean, the supposed good part, has high levels of estrogen mimicking plant sterols.
[01:04:44.571 --> 01:04:47.974]  But the core is almost pure estrogen.
[01:04:48.314 --> 01:04:52.258]  And so it hyper-feminizes the girls and feminizes the boys.
[01:04:52.358 --> 01:04:52.898]  Alan Watt.
[01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:55.781]  Yeah, and that was known from the beginning.
[01:04:55.821 --> 01:04:57.762]  These guys don't make mistakes.
[01:04:57.782 --> 01:05:00.165]  Henry Ford developed it all 87 years ago.
[01:05:00.225 --> 01:05:03.768]  It was almost 90 years ago.
[01:05:05.949 --> 01:05:10.253]  You find that Charles Galton Darwin wrote the book The Next Million Years in the 1950s.
[01:05:10.393 --> 01:05:11.194]  He was a physicist.
[01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.956]  And he was the grandson of Charles Darwin.
[01:05:15.616 --> 01:05:18.197]  And he was a eugenicist, and all for this agenda.
[01:05:18.217 --> 01:05:27.261]  But he put it in his book that they'd have to alter the hormonal levels of male and female, and if possible, get estrogen, high doses of estrogen, into the males.
[01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:29.782]  And he suggested a whole bunch of ways to do it.
[01:05:29.802 --> 01:05:39.986]  Yeah, there are thousands of types of plastics they could make, but they choose, for almost all plastic drinking containers, the type that leaches estrogen-mimicking chemicals.
[01:05:40.746 --> 01:05:46.231]  See, they chose that exact chemist calculation to hit you and hit you hard.
[01:05:46.752 --> 01:05:49.194]  Stay there, we're going to talk behind the scenes right now with Alan Watt.
[01:05:50.811 --> 01:05:58.214]  Alan, you have the total floor for three minutes, and we're going to come back and plug your books and videos and things and keep taking calls, but right now, you've got three minutes.
[01:05:59.015 --> 01:06:08.519]  Yeah, another thing to watch, too, is they put the same coating of this bisphenol even within beer cans now, and lots of canned vegetables, etc.
[01:06:08.899 --> 01:06:14.842]  Now, tin cans were fine all the way up until fairly recently until they put this stuff in, so why is it in there?
[01:06:14.982 --> 01:06:18.924]  It's to heighten the dose of bisphenol, or this artificial estrogen.
[01:06:19.424 --> 01:06:24.847]  And then you find out when they did the big baby campaign to stop mothers from using breast milk, etc.
[01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:33.591]  Then you found out that the actual rubber heat they had on the bottles was also made of the same stuff that gave them high doses of estrogen.
[01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:37.673]  And from then on, we've seen all the problems with males down through the generations.
[01:06:38.133 --> 01:06:41.234]  They also had the big companies that made baby food.
[01:06:41.334 --> 01:06:44.656]  Moms were convinced that ordinary food wasn't good enough anymore.
[01:06:44.736 --> 01:06:46.517]  Scientifically designed food was better.
[01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:48.878]  Then, they were doing the same thing.
[01:06:48.898 --> 01:06:59.242]  The big companies now have admitted that the chemical they used to supposedly sterilize those baby jars before putting in the food, it just happened to be a synthetic estrogen that they happened to use.
[01:06:59.262 --> 01:07:00.543]  And they just found that out now.
[01:07:01.043 --> 01:07:02.564]  So, come on, come on, come on.
[01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:03.724]  When do we wake up?
[01:07:04.384 --> 01:07:07.165]  And how long are we going to act stupid here?
[01:07:07.686 --> 01:07:10.007]  This was a planned war, which they published.
[01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:10.647]  They've done.
[01:07:11.523 --> 01:07:14.404]  And we still don't want to believe it is so horrific.
[01:07:14.924 --> 01:07:20.646]  Until we get past that stage and believe, yeah, this is truly a horror show, we don't stand a chance.
[01:07:21.186 --> 01:07:24.267]  And these guys have got to pay for this one day.
[01:07:24.287 --> 01:07:25.547]  They've got to pay for this.
[01:07:26.007 --> 01:07:27.268]  We can't let it go on.
[01:07:27.548 --> 01:07:29.929]  We can't let them go unpunished.
[01:07:29.949 --> 01:07:30.889]  It's got to be done.
[01:07:31.269 --> 01:07:32.249]  And they know this too.
[01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:34.390]  They know that when people start
[01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:38.779]  Uh, getting the education and coming back at them.
[01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:40.560]  These guys will be running for their lives.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:41.180]  They know that.
[01:07:41.761 --> 01:07:42.381]  What else can they do?
[01:07:42.481 --> 01:07:45.463]  They either kill us all off or have us hunt them.
[01:07:45.683 --> 01:07:46.183]  They know this.
[01:07:46.443 --> 01:07:47.063]  This is war.
[01:07:48.104 --> 01:07:48.985]  They're well aware of it.
[01:07:49.405 --> 01:07:50.705]  And these guys mean business.
[01:07:50.926 --> 01:07:52.466]  We better start meaning business, too.
[01:07:53.127 --> 01:07:56.669]  Or it's game over for all of us and all the children who could come.
[01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:58.310]  All of the children.
[01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:00.631]  That's the bottom line with the whole thing.
[01:08:00.651 --> 01:08:04.393]  Because, you know, the society has been so broken
[01:08:05.371 --> 01:08:18.420]  That the continuity of generations, which was so important to every people in the planet, a natural thing that gave you a form of security and peace of mind as you went through your life, that the cycles would continue, that has been broken.
[01:08:20.161 --> 01:08:29.008]  Natural affection has been almost destroyed, again, because of this war on the people, the war between the genders, etc.
[01:08:29.028 --> 01:08:30.969]  There's also a war between the generations.
[01:08:32.014 --> 01:08:33.976]  You read all of the communist literature.
[01:08:34.296 --> 01:08:38.679]  They said they'd have to destroy the connection and the bonds between all generations.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:42.502]  Then they, from the top, could control each generation.
[01:08:42.823 --> 01:08:43.583]  That has been done.
[01:08:43.944 --> 01:08:45.445]  That goes as far back as 1934.
[01:08:46.786 --> 01:08:49.228]  Comintern meeting that Beria presided over.
[01:08:50.006 --> 01:08:58.593]  He said it used to take 70 years before we could make major changes within the structure of society on a cultural basis.
[01:08:58.833 --> 01:09:03.076]  Now he said we can do it every five years and eventually it'll be done every year.
[01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.998]  Alright, we're going to go back on the main transmission now.
[01:09:06.018 --> 01:09:06.319]  Here we go.
[01:09:14.085 --> 01:09:43.560]  Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown Like a dog without a bone And actor out of loan Writer's on the storm There's a killer on the road His brain is squirming like a toad Take a long holiday
[01:09:47.222 --> 01:10:12.726]  Let your children play Give this man a ride Give this man a ride Sweet mamma, he will die Killer on the road Killer on the road His brain is swirming like a toad Give this man a ride And we will die We gave them more than a ride, they run it all
[01:10:16.395 --> 01:10:23.859]  More of your phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:10:23.939 --> 01:10:30.481]  I want to encourage all of the listeners to realize that we face a serious battle, but we're gaining a lot of ground.
[01:10:32.782 --> 01:10:34.303]  And the info war is the key.
[01:10:36.284 --> 01:10:43.047]  You can talk yourself blue in your face to your neighbors, co-workers, friends, family, strangers, and that has some effect, but videos are the key.
[01:10:46.829 --> 01:10:51.451]  And all you gotta do is direct people to sources of information that can break the matrix for them.
[01:10:51.731 --> 01:10:56.594]  And then once they finally see behind it, it's fire and forget.
[01:10:57.114 --> 01:11:00.316]  Once you get somebody to, whoa, I just saw the matrix, whoa!
[01:11:01.576 --> 01:11:04.198]  Then, they have unlocked their mind on their own.
[01:11:05.438 --> 01:11:12.825]  They can begin to see what's happening and that's where my films like Truth Rising that everybody needs on DVD available at InfoWars.com.
[01:11:13.766 --> 01:11:14.727]  That's where it's all available.
[01:11:14.747 --> 01:11:15.648]  Get it on DVD.
[01:11:15.708 --> 01:11:16.588]  Make copies of it.
[01:11:17.089 --> 01:11:17.950]  You know, low-tech it.
[01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:18.971]  Give it to everybody you know.
[01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:20.993]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:21.013 --> 01:11:22.454]  Get a 15-cent-a-day membership.
[01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:24.796]  Download the films at super high quality.
[01:11:24.836 --> 01:11:25.597]  Burn them to disk.
[01:11:25.737 --> 01:11:26.438]  Give them to people.
[01:11:27.844 --> 01:11:33.227]  And you know, and think, well if it's youngsters who are tech-savvy, you can burn them DivX copies of the film in high quality, as many as you want.
[01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.709]  It was designed for that on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:35.969 --> 01:11:37.250]  We're fighting the prison planet.
[01:11:39.431 --> 01:11:40.772]  We are educating the public.
[01:11:41.132 --> 01:11:44.234]  We are unlocking minds, and we're having a great effect.
[01:11:44.274 --> 01:11:46.655]  So again, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:54.220]  Call toll-free to get an in-game blueprint for Global Enslavement, the preeminent film for the wide-spectrum analysis of the New World Order system and their master plan.
[01:11:55.501 --> 01:11:56.502]  I've made 19 films.
[01:11:56.542 --> 01:12:05.589]  I carry a bunch of other books and videos, the best that I've seen out there at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:12:05.609 --> 01:12:12.115]  And before Alan leaves us, we're also going to plug some of his videos and materials that are excellent as well.
[01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:15.578]  We have links to his website up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:12:17.654 --> 01:12:25.757]  Alan, in fact, plug your website and stuff right now, and then I want to talk about the positive things that are happening, because the elite is not happy.
[01:12:25.797 --> 01:12:27.658]  They are worried about how many are waking up.
[01:12:28.638 --> 01:12:35.741]  I believe even with their predictive computer systems, they did not, they admit, expect this much awakening to happen.
[01:12:35.761 --> 01:12:41.343]  They'll probably just launch a bio-attack or a nuke or something early to get us to clutch back to their psychopathic under
[01:12:43.530 --> 01:13:01.283]  People should look into CuttingToTheMatrix.com and see what I have up there that keeps me going for sale.
[01:13:01.383 --> 01:13:07.488]  There's hundreds and hundreds of shows I've done and talks on all the various subjects to do with this order that's running the world.
[01:13:08.109 --> 01:13:10.370]  And you can also look into Alan Watt's SentientSentinel.eu.
[01:13:11.733 --> 01:13:18.496]  That's the European site, and that covers a lot of bases as well, with other data and transcripts which you can download and print up.
[01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:25.259]  But on the positive side of this, as you say, they're terribly, terribly worried.
[01:13:25.279 --> 01:13:29.441]  That's why they're out in such force and there's screaming terror everywhere.
[01:13:30.041 --> 01:13:36.984]  They're very, very worried now that the public will get wind of what's been happening to them, not just recently, but for a long time.
[01:13:37.817 --> 01:13:42.987]  And we know that they're terrified for their lives, actually, at the very top.
[01:13:43.327 --> 01:13:45.731]  And people who are terrified for their lives, conspirators,
[01:13:46.788 --> 01:13:48.368]  are lethal in their actions.
[01:13:48.809 --> 01:13:51.829]  They're absolutely lethal in their actions because they're ruthless.
[01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:53.430]  They must be ruthless to succeed.
[01:13:53.450 --> 01:14:08.293]  They know what will happen to them if all of this comes out and more and more of the public know what's been done to them, their families, their children, the sicknesses, the diseases that have gone through, the heartaches that they've gone through, watching people dying of cancers, etc.
[01:14:08.573 --> 01:14:09.314]  that were man-made.
[01:14:09.334 --> 01:14:11.114]  These people
[01:14:12.219 --> 01:14:13.620]  We'll have to be utterly ruthless.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:24.725]  And that's why the Preacher Society, a militarized society, to try and force us all to go along to the bitter end and do what's told, they're hoping that fear is going to stop us all.
[01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:26.746]  And fear will not stop us all.
[01:14:27.639 --> 01:14:30.900]  I have no doubt for us as well, eventually as well.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.982]  I have no doubt of that at all, if they can't get their way.
[01:14:34.422 --> 01:14:36.122]  But there's no other way to do this.
[01:14:36.202 --> 01:14:37.183]  There's no time left.
[01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:43.505]  You can't simply do the old way of passing information quietly down through the generations.
[01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:51.008]  Now is to put lots of information out on the right topics that really hit home to people, to put them into action.
[01:14:51.068 --> 01:14:57.391]  Because, you see, the elite have told us where they're taking us, which is the extinction, basically, of the species as we know it.
[01:14:58.197 --> 01:15:06.965]  The transhumanist agenda is so heavily well-funded with international organizations of professors and scientists to create the new types of humans.
[01:15:07.365 --> 01:15:13.430]  And they're the ones that stand up with 95% of the audience standing ovation.
[01:15:13.471 --> 01:15:13.911]  Yay!
[01:15:13.971 --> 01:15:14.712]  Kill everyone!
[01:15:14.752 --> 01:15:15.112]  Yes!
[01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:16.613]  Oh, yes!
[01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.135]  Oh, it's so wonderful!
[01:15:18.475 --> 01:15:19.836]  I mean, you know, that's in the news.
[01:15:19.956 --> 01:15:24.720]  So, one big thing they have going for them that I want people to point out to themselves
[01:15:26.306 --> 01:15:28.547]  The average person judges the world by their own actions.
[01:15:29.047 --> 01:15:38.870]  And so even when you're reading their own textbooks and documents where they admit they're doing all this, or when Peter Singer sang, kill the babies, kill the old people, or when a B.F.
[01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:53.275]  Skinner is murdering his own son and putting it in a textbook, and how he tortured him for years in a small box, and, oh it's beautiful, it's a sacrament, ooh, it's so liberal, it's so cutting edge, I mean it's this mental illness is normal, normalcy
[01:15:54.415 --> 01:15:57.277]  is evil and mentally ill to them.
[01:15:57.677 --> 01:16:05.461]  It's that people have that trouble dealing with something so monstrous, so big, so wicked, and it is frightening.
[01:16:05.601 --> 01:16:09.182]  I mean, it's frightening to admit this to yourselves, but folks, you don't have a choice.
[01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:11.283]  You have to fight back against this now.
[01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:12.784]  You have no choice.
[01:16:12.944 --> 01:16:14.565]  They have told us where they're taking us.
[01:16:14.605 --> 01:16:17.066]  They say that the old human is not good enough.
[01:16:18.227 --> 01:16:18.867]  It's obsolete.
[01:16:19.898 --> 01:16:25.263]  And they're going to create new types of humans, which eventually will have nothing in common with the old human.
[01:16:25.484 --> 01:16:34.413]  What they mean by that, they're going to create a perfect race of slaves to serve them, which will be unable to think for themselves as distinct, independent individuals.
[01:16:34.753 --> 01:16:36.094]  That's what they mean by that.
[01:16:36.114 --> 01:16:40.138]  So we've got to understand, they've planned our extinction, our death.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.862]  And they're publishing it now, openly.
[01:16:44.793 --> 01:16:49.503]  And they hope to guide us along so that we'll go along with it quite happily and willingly until we die off.
[01:16:49.583 --> 01:16:49.843]  That's right.
[01:16:49.863 --> 01:16:52.769]  They're teaching us how beautiful and wonderful it is.
[01:16:52.789 --> 01:16:54.052]  So again...
[01:16:55.686 --> 01:16:57.627]  Military, police, government bureaucrats.
[01:16:58.128 --> 01:17:16.861]  When you're wondering why your 10-year-old's dying of an advanced leukemia and why a kid down the street's dying of it, just remember, we warned you, we loved you, we believed in you, we tried to warn you, and you laughed back at us, and you went out and cracked somebody over the head with a belly club, or for some school teacher that's laughing, or some member of a state legislature who's laughing.
[01:17:17.801 --> 01:17:18.442]  Remember,
[01:17:19.463 --> 01:17:21.244]  Remember you were warned.
[01:17:21.264 --> 01:17:28.709]  I think that's important because, you know, we may not even make it another five years, another six years, another ten years, Alan, but people are going to remember these transmissions.
[01:17:28.849 --> 01:17:32.952]  And these transmissions are going to be passed around if the enemy succeeds when they're illegal.
[01:17:33.793 --> 01:17:37.876]  And people are going to huddle in areas they think are safe to even receive this info.
[01:17:38.776 --> 01:17:42.841]  And later they'll realize, this has already happened with stuff I put out twelve, thirteen years ago.
[01:17:42.902 --> 01:17:44.203]  People are just blown away by it now.
[01:17:44.524 --> 01:17:46.446]  You know, they go watch TV shows I did ten years ago.
[01:17:46.506 --> 01:17:47.627]  My God, it all happened!
[01:17:47.647 --> 01:17:48.609]  This guy's a prophet!
[01:17:48.929 --> 01:17:49.209]  No!
[01:17:49.289 --> 01:17:50.951]  The enemy told us everything!
[01:17:51.893 --> 01:17:53.374]  The enemy told us everything!
[01:17:53.415 --> 01:17:54.035]  So remember!
[01:17:54.878 --> 01:18:01.762]  When you think one out of three getting cancer from one in thirty-three, you know, is bad, wait until it's everybody.
[01:18:02.102 --> 01:18:09.787]  You see, just remember, just remember we told you, we were right, we cared, we have the courage to tell you if we're not able to turn this around.
[01:18:09.807 --> 01:18:16.631]  And I think remember too, the technique they're using at the moment, through all the fear creation,
[01:18:17.395 --> 01:18:22.338]  When you live under fear and stress for a long time, it's no different than being in a torture chamber.
[01:18:22.659 --> 01:18:23.719]  You'll crack eventually.
[01:18:23.779 --> 01:18:30.104]  It makes you more malleable, more suggestible, and you're guided by the authorities along ridiculous paths.
[01:18:30.424 --> 01:18:34.366]  Ridiculous if you were completely conscious and perfectly sane at the time.
[01:18:34.586 --> 01:18:35.567]  You would not go along them.
[01:18:35.907 --> 01:18:42.712]  But when you're under tremendous stress and fear, fear of all the coming crises and food crises and all the crises they're creating,
[01:18:44.143 --> 01:18:45.924]  They want you to be so apathetic.
[01:18:46.084 --> 01:18:51.107]  That was an essential tool to create apathy, to allow yourself to be gated to the slaughterhouse.
[01:18:51.748 --> 01:18:52.608]  That's what they want.
[01:18:53.369 --> 01:18:56.931]  And so we mustn't let all of this crisis creation beat us down.
[01:18:57.171 --> 01:19:06.037]  Imagine if we could take the US or another country back and then bring all this out and show everybody the documents and have public trials showing how they did it.
[01:19:06.357 --> 01:19:09.960]  And then basically outlaw or restrict these technologies of control.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.142]  Then we could have a true golden age of humanity and go to the stars.
[01:19:13.902 --> 01:19:25.987]  And we'd have to watch every person that we allow to have authority in any science whatsoever to be monitored all the time by the public, all of the public, when they wish to.
[01:19:26.407 --> 01:19:27.627]  Total transparency.
[01:19:28.267 --> 01:19:29.208]  Absolutely, it'd have to be.
[01:19:31.286 --> 01:19:31.666]  Have to be.
[01:19:32.046 --> 01:19:39.811]  You cannot allow foundations and organizations with secrecy and the backing of billions of dollars to do as they wish anymore.
[01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:40.611]  You cannot do that.
[01:19:40.751 --> 01:19:58.882]  And I have to say, I'm not calling for any form of tyranny, but this ultimate dehumanization, this perfection of darkness and wickedness is so dangerous and will always try to come back that we do, as you said, need to have absolute transparency and it will take
[01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:05.026]  You know, defeating it, unfortunately, I have to say, will take some type of tyranny itself.
[01:20:05.406 --> 01:20:10.370]  I hate to say that, Alan, but this thing is, this is human-ending systems we're talking about.
[01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:12.531]  This New World Order must be outlawed.
[01:20:13.211 --> 01:20:13.912]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:20:13.972 --> 01:20:21.517]  You cannot have secrecy and secret societies and foundations and world citizenships, I mean, that's what they call themselves now.
[01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:28.062]  Even the Club of Rome put themselves out under the Rockefeller Foundation, initially, as world citizens.
[01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:33.464]  And, you understand, it sounds nice and fuzzy on... It means worldwide prison.
[01:20:33.504 --> 01:20:35.966]  It means worldwide extermination grid.
[01:20:36.586 --> 01:20:37.207]  Absolutely.
[01:20:37.227 --> 01:20:44.672]  They're behind eugenics and everything else, because they decide what is a good citizen, what constitutes a healthy citizen, mental and otherwise.
[01:20:44.852 --> 01:20:45.492]  Well, here's an example.
[01:20:45.512 --> 01:20:46.173]  I mean, here's an example.
[01:20:46.193 --> 01:20:49.835]  They say families are unhealthy, everything's bad, but the bills they create.
[01:20:50.796 --> 01:20:57.881]  I told people 12 years ago, because I had the documents, and I had a congressman on the show, and I had a member of parliament from Australia on,
[01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:06.303]  I found out that everybody at birth for 35 years now, it's almost 36, had blood taken and was put in an international database.
[01:21:06.323 --> 01:21:07.363]  I gave them where it was stored.
[01:21:07.483 --> 01:21:25.687]  Now, because the show got big enough and others talked about it, they went ahead in the last six months and came out and said, yes, we're taking all your blood, it's in a database, we're keeping DNA databases, we're putting it in criminal databases, Homeland Security has it, and then they're now passing retroactive laws saying it was okay to take your blood.
[01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:27.868]  Folks, the government is so criminal.
[01:21:29.048 --> 01:21:37.172]  That they've been taking your blood in the industrialized world for 35 years and the program started everywhere the same year, 35 years ago.
[01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:40.514]  See that shows the global government is already in place.
[01:21:40.874 --> 01:21:51.999]  It's just sending down more tentacles, more tripods, more control systems and building a pyramid of control up around the skeleton of the pyramid that already shot out decades ago.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.862]  Yeah, but Nick, the big world leaders signed
[01:21:57.802 --> 01:22:03.249]  The agreement and the charter at the United Nations in California at the end of World War II.
[01:22:03.489 --> 01:22:04.090]  Presidio!
[01:22:04.731 --> 01:22:04.931]  Yeah.
[01:22:05.451 --> 01:22:08.996]  What they did was sign on, and they knew it at the top.
[01:22:09.036 --> 01:22:10.257]  Those guys at the top knew this.
[01:22:11.038 --> 01:22:13.221]  This whole agenda was to come from that.
[01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:16.966]  It wasn't about... See, world peace, you'd understand how they define peace.
[01:22:17.921 --> 01:22:21.083]  That means everyone dead, but a few million elitist.
[01:22:21.544 --> 01:22:22.124]  That's correct.
[01:22:22.164 --> 01:22:28.129]  Peace means, just like the Emperor says in Revenge of the Sith, he goes, we'll kill everybody and then we'll have peace.
[01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:29.510]  Yes, that's it.
[01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:30.570]  That's absolutely it.
[01:22:31.151 --> 01:22:39.217]  And they had the whole agenda worked out before they signed the Charter that they'd destroy the family unit, create a war between male and female,
[01:22:39.757 --> 01:22:40.117]  Unbelievable.
[01:22:40.137 --> 01:22:40.758]  Who's up next here?
[01:22:40.778 --> 01:22:42.119]  I got calls all over the map.
[01:22:42.199 --> 01:22:43.060]  Allen in Virginia.
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.861]  Allen in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:22:44.901 --> 01:22:45.101]  Hello?
[01:22:45.441 --> 01:22:46.002]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:12.732]  Yes, I'm real privileged to be on today.
[01:23:12.872 --> 01:23:22.599]  Usually the system will kick callers off after ten minutes, but fortunately there was a glitch today and the queue got cleared for me.
[01:23:23.459 --> 01:23:28.303]  I wanted to talk with your guest today, Alan Watts, about... You know what?
[01:23:28.343 --> 01:23:29.443]  I'm not going to let that go by.
[01:23:30.104 --> 01:23:33.366]  John, there's no system that kicks callers off the phone system, is there?
[01:23:33.726 --> 01:23:34.327]  No, there's not.
[01:23:34.947 --> 01:23:35.448]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:36.288 --> 01:23:38.250]  And everybody keeps saying they're hearing a tshhh.
[01:23:38.650 --> 01:23:42.813]  That's what the Telos phone system does in talk radio to let you know you're on the air.
[01:23:42.853 --> 01:23:45.395]  It goes tshhh when we go to you, caller.
[01:23:45.475 --> 01:23:48.877]  So, it's something with your phone if you're being kicked off after ten minutes.
[01:23:48.897 --> 01:23:59.905]  But the point is, I'm not mad at you, but this is a classic kind of mental distraction here that each caller will add some little inanity to as a preface to what they're saying.
[01:24:00.085 --> 01:24:01.266]  I want to get to all the calls.
[01:24:01.586 --> 01:24:02.547]  So you've got the floor.
[01:24:02.567 --> 01:24:03.708]  Do you have an issue to cover?
[01:24:05.491 --> 01:24:06.031]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:07.592 --> 01:24:20.856]  I called several weeks ago and mentioned that I was a transhumanist, or I identify as such, and I wanted to talk with your guest today about whether the... I've not been able to identify.
[01:24:20.896 --> 01:24:33.400]  I mean, I've done extensive Google searches on everything from brain-computer interfaces to people talking about collective consciousness and stuff, and what I've found is that the
[01:24:34.215 --> 01:24:39.399]  Most advanced brain computer interface out there is called the BrainGate.
[01:24:40.579 --> 01:24:43.081]  It's not terribly impressive in itself.
[01:24:43.201 --> 01:24:50.086]  It's just a centimeter squared unit which can be implanted on the cortex.
[01:24:55.410 --> 01:25:03.392]  And it does provide for a limited... Sir, they were remote controlling rats with total control, even controlling their heart rates 20 years ago.
[01:25:03.772 --> 01:25:05.852]  They have robo-rats deployed all over the world.
[01:25:05.932 --> 01:25:08.493]  I mean, they had robo-roaches 25 years ago.
[01:25:08.513 --> 01:25:12.074]  Are you saying... Oh my God, just go ahead.
[01:25:13.274 --> 01:25:20.556]  Well, yes, the BrainGate chip, I mean, you have to understand that if you want some dramatic result, yes, you can...
[01:25:21.451 --> 01:25:27.401]  Get a dramatic result like increasing the heart rate and providing a euphoric feeling.
[01:25:27.601 --> 01:25:28.643]  What is your point?
[01:25:28.723 --> 01:25:30.926]  What are you saying we're making up?
[01:25:30.966 --> 01:25:33.510]  Everything's fine, the government loves us, take your shots basically?
[01:25:34.745 --> 01:25:46.808]  No, not at all, and I think that there is a great deal of evil in the government, but I'm just saying that Mr. Watts is jumping the gun, and... Well, let me answer that, but with some facts for a change, okay?
[01:25:47.248 --> 01:26:03.472]  Delgado, who ran the FBI department on mind control at one point, was controlling bulls in the arena back in the 1950s and 60s completely, so the stuff that you're talking about, and it's published in the so-called magazines and so on that you look at, is completely and utterly obsolete.
[01:26:04.102 --> 01:26:06.303]  These guys are so far advanced and stuff.
[01:26:06.323 --> 01:26:07.524]  They don't publish to you.
[01:26:07.864 --> 01:26:09.665]  They're quite confident they can pull this off.
[01:26:10.025 --> 01:26:12.086]  And it's not just about getting a brain implant.
[01:26:12.387 --> 01:26:17.910]  Who the hell do you think is going to program you when you're in this virtual real world yourself?
[01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:18.970]  You won't be doing it.
[01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:21.431]  They're programming you through the television set.
[01:26:21.471 --> 01:26:21.992]  Go ahead, Alan.
[01:26:22.728 --> 01:26:24.648]  Yeah, I mean, these guys are so stupid.
[01:26:25.128 --> 01:26:38.431]  On the one hand, they believe that there's somehow some altruism left amongst the psychopaths that allow them to go into this virtual world that'll be part cyborg and part this and part something else, and be allowed to do what they want.
[01:26:38.451 --> 01:26:43.512]  The whole intent of this virtual world is so that you can be completely and utterly controlled.
[01:26:44.212 --> 01:26:48.653]  You find at the World Science Meeting held in Louisiana in 2001,
[01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:59.106]  Yeah, stay there, stay there.
[01:26:59.126 --> 01:27:00.227]  We're going to keep talking.
[01:27:01.528 --> 01:27:02.429]  I want to keep going here.
[01:27:03.069 --> 01:27:13.317]  Look, we're not trying to beat you up here, Allen in Virginia, but out of the gate she just brought up some stuff that wasn't accurate about the phone system here at the network.
[01:27:15.168 --> 01:27:21.913]  You know, the architecture of the technological revolution, we're not saying it couldn't be empowering, as low-level transhumanists say.
[01:27:22.213 --> 01:27:34.261]  We understand that the point is, it's being deployed and funded as a control mechanism, and we've been right about every step of this, and you're saying you can't find where they say they're going to use this as a control mechanism?
[01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:35.963]  What about the January 7, 2000
[01:27:38.004 --> 01:27:42.266]  Well, I'm saying, sir, that I've not been able to find any thinker or a group or anybody
[01:28:01.411 --> 01:28:06.772]  And who actually discusses about inhuman collective consciousness in any serious terms.
[01:28:06.792 --> 01:28:23.436]  Well you just, I mean it's not my, number one, and I appreciate your call, I mean I really, it's in my book, Descent into Tyranny, I've made films about it, Bill Joyce, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, owner of Sun Microsystems, chairman of Sun Microsystems, saying the elite have decided to basically kill all of us,
[01:28:24.916 --> 01:28:31.599]  I mean, it's throughout the literature that the elite is going to get rid of the majority of us, and they're going to be gods empowered with all this.
[01:28:31.919 --> 01:28:37.701]  So you're saying, with no proof, that you can't find proof, when there's a mountain of it.
[01:28:37.721 --> 01:28:38.661]  Alan Watt?
[01:28:39.582 --> 01:28:40.642]  It's just, it's incredible.
[01:28:40.662 --> 01:28:48.265]  The universities, they've had world meetings recently across the planet on the transhumanist societies.
[01:28:48.345 --> 01:28:53.347]  Heavily funded, big foundations, big professors from all the top universities.
[01:28:54.005 --> 01:28:54.606]  I don't think so.
[01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:12.630]  And I think that's a positive thing, but of course it's going to be used for bad.
[01:29:13.411 --> 01:29:17.753]  They've got all sorts of brain chips to stop seizures and things.
[01:29:18.514 --> 01:29:30.300]  I mean, Aldous Huxley, whose brother ran the UN, Julian Huxley, right before he died in 62, talked about how he'd been seeing secret programs in the 50s with people remote controlled by wires.
[01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:35.363]  When my dad was at University of Texas, he knew people were doing experiments.
[01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:37.724]  And what this last fellow said, too, is interesting.
[01:29:37.744 --> 01:29:38.645]  He's into the collective mind.
[01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.606]  See, that's been pushed through all the New Age movement.
[01:29:59.628 --> 01:30:00.468]  We're all one.
[01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:02.169]  The collective mind.
[01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:04.930]  The collective mind means you have no mind of your own.
[01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:07.371]  Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[01:30:13.609 --> 01:30:16.770]  There's a bunch of control freaks that want to try to dominate society.
[01:30:16.830 --> 01:30:19.350]  We think the future belongs to them and them alone.
[01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:26.191]  And I'm here to tell them this is a declaration of independence against war, you pot-bellied, chicken-necked pedophiles.
[01:30:26.951 --> 01:30:29.892]  You degenerate, power-tripping sickos.
[01:30:30.352 --> 01:30:31.972]  You are going down!
[01:30:32.912 --> 01:30:37.913]  We're going to get our hands around your scrawny necks, you bastards.
[01:30:48.503 --> 01:30:50.064]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:30:50.085 --> 01:30:51.145]  No, we already went to David.
[01:30:51.346 --> 01:30:52.566]  Bill in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:30:52.607 --> 01:30:53.027]  Go ahead.
[01:30:54.228 --> 01:30:56.129]  He's gone too.
[01:30:56.169 --> 01:30:57.030]  Next up is Tom.
[01:30:57.230 --> 01:30:58.932]  Man, this IM system giving me collars.
[01:30:59.032 --> 01:30:59.912]  It's just all jumbled.
[01:31:00.233 --> 01:31:01.333]  Just tell me again who it is.
[01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:02.514]  We'll just try to muddle through it.
[01:31:02.955 --> 01:31:04.036]  Tom in North Carolina.
[01:31:04.076 --> 01:31:06.177]  Tom in North Carolina, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[01:31:07.338 --> 01:31:09.820]  Hey Alex, this is Tom McMillan.
[01:31:10.361 --> 01:31:12.783]  John McMillan, son, I talked to you years ago.
[01:31:14.524 --> 01:31:15.725]  John McMillan was killed
[01:31:16.495 --> 01:31:22.217]  And 82 for talking about the Trilateral Commission and Rothschilds and International Bankers.
[01:31:22.277 --> 01:31:27.518]  Which the public used to tell us didn't exist, now it's all been announced and they say it exists but it's good!
[01:31:28.579 --> 01:31:43.403]  And this September I keep getting the same feeling that, you know, it's like post-traumatic stress syndrome for the families of the revolutionaries, the good patriots that spoke about these years ago.
[01:31:44.395 --> 01:31:45.276]  And they have
[01:32:03.308 --> 01:32:15.260]  You know I forget your story so this is kind of off topic because we're right here at the end of the show and I don't even know what you're talking about so if I don't I don't think the listeners do.
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:24.849]  You said last time you said well I guess you're telling the truth but this story made national attention he was a celebrity you sound just like him
[01:32:26.633 --> 01:32:27.313]  And they killed him.
[01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:30.015]  They shot him 18 times in Bexar County, Georgia.
[01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:32.576]  Brought a SWAT team out of Athens, Georgia.
[01:32:32.596 --> 01:32:33.677]  Okay, tell me the name again.
[01:32:33.697 --> 01:32:34.317]  Who?
[01:32:34.337 --> 01:32:35.878]  B. McMillan.
[01:32:36.279 --> 01:32:36.759]  Say it again.
[01:32:37.319 --> 01:32:39.681]  John B. McMillan.
[01:32:39.981 --> 01:32:42.042]  M-C-M-I-L-L-A-N.
[01:32:43.283 --> 01:32:44.744]  And it's documented.
[01:32:44.784 --> 01:32:49.267]  I don't know if you can pull it up from the Atlanta... And the government told you that's a gag order?
[01:32:50.287 --> 01:32:51.968]  Well... Gag orders have... Screw them!
[01:32:52.028 --> 01:32:52.729]  Do whatever you want!
[01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:55.336]  I mean, I do whatever I want.
[01:32:55.376 --> 01:32:56.918]  They tell me not to talk, I'll keep talking.
[01:32:57.538 --> 01:33:09.408]  I know, but see, I'm talking to you because I don't believe in the gag rule, and I keep talking to everybody I know out here in Western North Carolina about this story.
[01:33:10.402 --> 01:33:13.244]  And I'm a little sensitive about this.
[01:33:40.802 --> 01:33:42.743]  Alex and Alan, thanks for giving them hell.
[01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:43.603]  I appreciate it.
[01:33:43.883 --> 01:33:46.684]  Yeah, I'll keep it real quick for you, because I know it's at the end of the show.
[01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:51.286]  I can't think of any other way to exit the show with something constructive.
[01:33:51.706 --> 01:33:57.568]  We put up the No New World... NoNewWorldOrder.com website up.
[01:33:58.188 --> 01:33:59.769]  It's a money bomb for Chuck Baldwin.
[01:34:00.529 --> 01:34:04.471]  I can't think of any other candidate out there who's been more vocal against the New World Order.
[01:34:04.491 --> 01:34:05.371]  Okay, we're out of time.
[01:34:05.411 --> 01:34:06.131]  Got to let you go.
[01:34:08.319 --> 01:34:13.080]  We're going to have some days this week where I just take phone calls so everybody can get on because then they're hurried and it doesn't work well.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.501]  Alan Watt, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:34:15.521 --> 01:34:16.921]  It's been a pleasure.
[01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:17.861]  You bet.
[01:34:17.881 --> 01:34:18.402]  Take care.
[01:34:20.722 --> 01:34:27.864]  And to John B. McMillan's son, I don't mean to sound rude, it's just at the end of the show it makes no sense and I just don't even know what you're talking about.
[01:34:28.324 --> 01:34:30.985]  Okay, InfoWars.com, retransmission starts now.
[01:34:32.827 --> 01:34:36.033]  With a bunch of big guests today on the streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:36.374 --> 01:34:37.716]  Get the free podcast there as well.
[01:34:37.736 --> 01:34:38.217]  God bless you.
