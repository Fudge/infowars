[00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:09.613]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:19.184]  Curt Nemo is going to be with us for 30 minutes to the next hour, then George Comfrey for an hour and a half.
[00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:22.865]  And your phone calls continually throughout.
[00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:27.247]  Mike and Gary and Bob and many others that are holding patiently.
[00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:31.628]  A few sponsors of the show I want to tell you about.
[00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:40.531]  First off, PrisonPlanet.tv makes so much of this radio show, the websites, the films possible via your subscriptions to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:41.131]  It's $5.95 a month.
[00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:50.685]  It is, you get a yearly membership, you get three months free, you can go to a trial month-to-month, $5.95 at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:51.105 --> 00:02:07.958]  Not only all 18 of my films, my weekly TV reports, we videotaped a lot of the in-studio interviews, the Sunday show, expanded extras from films, like you got an hour and 40 minutes extra from Endgame that wasn't even an extra on the DVD called Endgame 1.5.
[00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.120]  Now we take at least the fourth hour every day
[00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:13.039]  And have a document cam.
[00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.222]  We have two in-studio cams on myself and whoever my guest happens to be.
[00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:22.343]  We're going to have several guests in studio a week.
[00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:25.345]  We generally do, but we're going to try to make sure we do that each week now.
[00:02:26.525 --> 00:02:32.408]  And of course, we have a video feed where we can also show you exclusive videos first.
[00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:35.230]  Like we premiered 20 minutes of my new JFK film.
[00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.211]  Some of the raw footage from it here last week.
[00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:39.732]  That's going to be happening every week.
[00:02:40.623 --> 00:02:45.692]  Things that have never been seen before will premiere here at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:48.697]  You can go through and get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for that.
[00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:52.383]  So that's very, very important if you want to be able to see the fourth hour.
[00:02:52.663 --> 00:02:54.687]  Now today you're going to get the third and fourth hour.
[00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:58.406]  With Kurt Nemo and George Humphrey on the document cam.
[00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:02.347]  Also there's other sponsors that make this show possible.
[00:03:03.068 --> 00:03:05.168]  And one of them is New Vitality.
[00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:07.889]  They have an excellent website.
[00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.831]  We have a link to that up on InfoWars.com or you can link over to New Vitality.
[00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:17.012]  Some of the pages where you can get discounts.
[00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:23.055]  And they just have a lot of really amazing products at the New Vitality website.
[00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:26.738]  You can also give them a call for things like the Aloe Ease Colon and Body Cleanse.
[00:03:27.098 --> 00:03:28.560]  Really cleanses you out.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.320]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:33.383]  Or their Super Beta Prostate if you're 45 or older.
[00:03:33.403 --> 00:03:35.105]  A lot of men have prostate problems.
[00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.086]  These are well known herbs.
[00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:37.647]  These are just mainline herbs.
[00:03:38.147 --> 00:03:40.468]  We don't sell any of the magic cure stuff here, sorry.
[00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:44.709]  This is just well known for good prostate health and to shrink the prostate.
[00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.750]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.010]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:03:50.211 --> 00:04:00.014]  Also, we have the great folks at eFoods Direct, the place I've decided to get storable foods, I guess, five different times since 2001.
[00:04:00.914 --> 00:04:04.975]  And it lasts more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years out in the barn or in the attic.
[00:04:05.515 --> 00:04:07.396]  If it's not climate controlled, it's freeze-dried.
[00:04:07.987 --> 00:04:11.913]  It's been dehydrated, and it's just really high quality food.
[00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:13.155]  It's all clean.
[00:04:14.096 --> 00:04:15.097]  None of it is GMO.
[00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.422]  Some of it does not have organic certification, though.
[00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:20.966]  That's a fine line there, but none of it's GMO.
[00:04:20.986 --> 00:04:21.887]  99% is organic.
[00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.190]  Stuff like bananas, they can't get those.
[00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.731]  It's very hard to get them organic, but they are non-GMO.
[00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:37.113]  So they're just wonderful folks, and with all the uncertainty going on, it's a good idea to give them a call.
[00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:43.235]  1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or huge banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:48.476]  Okay, Kurt Nemo on the other side, in studio with us.
[00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:52.417]  Everybody watching on the video cameras at PrisonPlanet.tv, there's
[00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:54.449]  Kurt there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:57.611]  Good to have Kurt here with us.
[00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.592]  He is such a character.
[00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:00.173]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.193 --> 00:05:01.835]  I guess we're all characters in this office, though.
[00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:02.815]  All right.
[00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:07.019]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with our number three.
[00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:13.684]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:05:13.704 --> 00:05:16.626]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:05:18.467 --> 00:05:19.848]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:21.950]  A new world order.
[00:05:22.674 --> 00:05:26.916]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.718]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:30.418 --> 00:05:32.499]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.641]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:43.765]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:51.669]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.613]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:58.475]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:58.596 --> 00:05:59.757]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:00.537]  They're not after money.
[00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:01.619]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.499]  They're after power.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.201]  That's what they're after.
[00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:04.842]  Cover-ups.
[00:06:04.882 --> 00:06:05.682]  You want answers?
[00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:08.365]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:11.668]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.233]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:29.344]  Well, for the next 30 minutes, Kurt Nemo is in studio with us.
[00:06:29.364 --> 00:06:33.707]  I'm going to get Kurt back in studio tomorrow for another little 30-minute visit.
[00:06:33.787 --> 00:06:46.478]  He is busy in there like a little bee, updating InfoWars during the breaks, and he is coming to visit us from his abode in New Mexico, and we appreciate his wife letting him leave the
[00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:54.101]  The little command carrier out there in New Mexico and visit the mothership, the flagship, here in Austin, Texas.
[00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.082]  Kurt, what do you think of our info bunker?
[00:06:57.222 --> 00:06:57.903]  Well, it's great.
[00:06:58.063 --> 00:07:00.864]  I mean, I understand it was called the Submarine?
[00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:04.185]  Yes, the Submarine is the internal nickname.
[00:07:04.205 --> 00:07:08.086]  So there's wires and people all in close proximity.
[00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:09.627]  The Ant Hill is another good name for it.
[00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:11.508]  It's a good setup.
[00:07:12.408 --> 00:07:13.988]  Yeah, well, we need to get a bigger office.
[00:07:14.008 --> 00:07:15.329]  We have people on top of each other.
[00:07:16.863 --> 00:07:19.407]  Basically have people bunking on top of each other.
[00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:27.420]  Ceilings are high enough to build another platform up above everybody and somebody can wriggle up into some wiring and do their updating from there, huh?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.006]  Well, just install a periscope in your set, you know what I mean?
[00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:35.042]  Kurt, there's a lot going on.
[00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:49.146]  I want to take some calls coming up in the next segment, but I figured you'd want to talk about, because I know she posted a lot last night on InfoWars about this, how they're now saying, they even publicly say, stop having your focus on Al-Qaeda.
[00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:52.027]  Now the new terror threat that's going to attack America is Iran.
[00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:55.228]  When Iran is saying, we want peace, we want peace, we want peace,
[00:07:57.196 --> 00:07:58.177]  And has let the U.N.
[00:07:58.217 --> 00:07:58.977]  run all over them.
[00:07:58.997 --> 00:08:00.658]  They have no nuclear weapons.
[00:08:01.758 --> 00:08:02.379]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:03.879]  Well, no, it doesn't.
[00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:09.382]  Because, well, the neocons have said from the start they want to attack, you know, Iran.
[00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:11.583]  Iraq, Iran, Syria.
[00:08:12.804 --> 00:08:14.605]  They've told us all along what they want to do.
[00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:15.345]  That's nothing new.
[00:08:15.425 --> 00:08:17.326]  I mean, this is just what they want to do.
[00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.347]  And so they're setting the stage for it.
[00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:21.556]  Well, they certainly are.
[00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:22.617]  They certainly are.
[00:08:23.117 --> 00:08:25.318]  Do you think they're going to attack them by the end of the year?
[00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:28.300]  I think they'll attack before the end of the year.
[00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:29.681]  Before the end of Bush's term.
[00:08:31.283 --> 00:08:31.863]  What's his name?
[00:08:32.403 --> 00:08:32.884]  Podhertz?
[00:08:32.904 --> 00:08:34.665]  I don't know how to pronounce the guy's name.
[00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:36.566]  Major Neocon said that they want to attack.
[00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:40.749]  In fact, he told Israeli television they will attack before Bush leaves office.
[00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:48.915]  Boy, I tell you, Israel is really getting obvious about the amount of control they've got over our government.
[00:08:49.878 --> 00:08:58.660]  Well, you know, AIPAC's in there, and they're in Washington lobbying the government, and pro-Israeli neocons are ensconced in the White House, so there you go.
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.280]  They're in control.
[00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:08.622]  But Lebanon didn't go too well, and neither has Iraq on a lot of levels.
[00:09:09.402 --> 00:09:15.804]  I wonder why the Israeli lobby, some of the other interests as well, the weapons makers,
[00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:20.151]  I mean, we have the European elite at least publicly saying they're against it.
[00:09:20.171 --> 00:09:21.772]  I think we do see a split within the elite.
[00:09:22.652 --> 00:09:27.575]  I wonder why they've got so much arrogance or hubris, or I guess it really is chutzpah.
[00:09:28.243 --> 00:09:36.465]  Well, you know, you look at their history, they had wars since the establishment of the Israeli state, and they did darn good for all those wars.
[00:09:36.865 --> 00:09:38.266]  So the hubris continues over.
[00:09:39.066 --> 00:09:47.808]  But, you know, you take a look at what's going on in the Middle East now, the Arabs are getting stronger and stronger, and the resistance movements in that area are getting stronger and stronger.
[00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:50.329]  So, it doesn't work anymore.
[00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:53.510]  You know, Hezbollah pretty much cleaned their clock when they went in there.
[00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.830]  Was it last year, last summer?
[00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.151]  Or was it the summer before?
[00:09:56.311 --> 00:09:56.751]  I don't remember.
[00:09:58.393 --> 00:09:59.874]  Well, the same thing happened with Hitler.
[00:09:59.914 --> 00:10:02.556]  He thought he could just invade everybody and then he started getting his butt kicked.
[00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:03.797]  Right.
[00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:04.797]  Hubris.
[00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:06.679]  Well...
[00:10:08.888 --> 00:10:11.390]  You know, I like to be a little more sophisticated.
[00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:18.735]  I do believe Israel is one of the dominant lobbies and certainly wants all these wars and certainly brags openly how they run the U.S.
[00:10:20.116 --> 00:10:25.259]  But to a certain extent, there are other lobbies that also want war.
[00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:28.161]  You know, I mentioned the weapons manufacturers.
[00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:33.504]  But if they destroy the nation that's their base of operations, how are they going to continue to do this?
[00:10:34.025 --> 00:10:35.986]  I guess the view is they're globalists, so it doesn't matter.
[00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:41.793]  Beyond the quarterly earnings statements?
[00:10:42.193 --> 00:10:44.377]  Just like any other large multinational corporation.
[00:10:44.417 --> 00:10:45.198]  They don't think about it.
[00:10:45.719 --> 00:10:46.400]  Kurt, I agree with you.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.381]  We're about to write a comeback.
[00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:49.485]  We'll talk more about Iran.
[00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:50.626]  Stay with us.
[00:10:56.011 --> 00:11:08.720]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.983]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:11:13.323 --> 00:11:19.846]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:23.407]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:11:23.627 --> 00:11:31.130]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:30.310]  And to inaugurate Kurt and Emma being in studio today, I'm even wearing a sports jacket for everybody out there watching to honor Kurt.
[00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.490]  Kurt, you have done, and all the viewers.
[00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.431]  I'm going to start wearing a three-piece suit in here for you on the show.
[00:14:35.451 --> 00:14:36.152]  No, I'm just joking.
[00:14:36.252 --> 00:14:36.912]  Don't hold your breath.
[00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:40.473]  Kurt, I just really appreciate the great job you've been doing on the website.
[00:14:40.893 --> 00:14:48.456]  I want to talk briefly about some of the changes in InfoWars, the changes that are coming to Prison Planet, and there's going to be even more we're going to be adding to InfoWars in the near future.
[00:14:48.756 --> 00:14:51.938]  But before we do that, continuing with Israel.
[00:14:53.138 --> 00:15:00.988]  I mean, Israeli Prime Ministers, Israeli Members of Parliament and others have said, Ariel Sharon said, we own and run the U.S.
[00:15:01.008 --> 00:15:01.488]  Congress.
[00:15:02.349 --> 00:15:05.053]  And so he does deserve, you know, that does deserve to be talked about.
[00:15:06.365 --> 00:15:24.456]  It's just at the same time, there are other global interests based in London, based in Europe, the Rothschilds dominating that, but there's also a lot of British Lords and others, that I feel like have given Israel and the neocons the ball, and they're masters at using fronts, and I believe it is a partner.
[00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:35.043]  I'm not saying it's even junior, but they're using a partner as the front, just from studying it, because how do you square the Zionist funding Hitler
[00:15:36.224 --> 00:15:44.273]  And that's now mainstream news, saying don't let Jews out of Israel, don't let them escape, only let them come to Palestine.
[00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:51.702]  The famous quote by one of the founders of Israel saying, one cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Israel.
[00:15:52.102 --> 00:15:53.244]  Really horrible statements.
[00:15:53.884 --> 00:15:55.165]  And then how do you square the U.S.
[00:15:55.205 --> 00:16:08.129]  government bringing Nazis in and then paying Israel hundreds of millions of dollars to radiate 110,000 Jews with the ringworm children and all the Nazis that were here and the eugenics program
[00:16:08.689 --> 00:16:08.989]  Yes.
[00:16:26.947 --> 00:16:30.670]  There is this Nazi, you know, occultic death cult.
[00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.712]  Occultism, people say, oh, Nazi death cult.
[00:16:33.012 --> 00:16:33.533]  Ha ha ha.
[00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:35.534]  I mean, that's real.
[00:16:35.574 --> 00:16:36.575]  That's in the history books.
[00:16:36.615 --> 00:16:37.476]  That's what they're into.
[00:16:37.816 --> 00:16:44.101]  Hitler and the torch running through all the cities in 36 that were then later attacked.
[00:16:45.202 --> 00:16:49.666]  The original Olympic flame has never been extinguished from Hitler lighting it in 36.
[00:16:50.006 --> 00:16:51.347]  That comes from the eugenics
[00:16:52.348 --> 00:17:15.451]  uh... what twenty four hundred years ago in greece and the torch lighting about who the superman is who's related to hercules the nazi ideals came from play-doh for those who haven't read play-doh's republic and some of those other writings so that's what you know i try to cover it all it's a very sick amalgamation at the top and so if you fight against
[00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:22.219]  If you're killing Jews and fight against the New World Order doing it, you'll get called a Nazi.
[00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:23.659]  If you fight the New World Order, they'll call you a Nazi.
[00:17:23.879 --> 00:17:31.442]  But then if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, who brags about how he loves Hitler and wants to be worshipped and his dad was an SS officer, then you get ADL awards.
[00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:33.883]  I mean, what I'm saying is there's more to it.
[00:17:34.323 --> 00:17:36.964]  It's very... I mean, look at them worshipping the Olympics right now.
[00:17:37.184 --> 00:17:41.565]  Hitler drew the rings and he designed it all, the chalice for the flame.
[00:17:41.845 --> 00:17:43.706]  I mean, I've got documentaries where he...
[00:17:44.486 --> 00:17:44.926]  What's the film?
[00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:45.927]  Architecture of Doom?
[00:17:46.327 --> 00:17:52.009]  Goes through all of his architecture and Albert Spheer, who he later made the head of the German economy, who was the architect.
[00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:55.010]  I mean, I know all this, so I know there's more to it.
[00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:00.812]  And really, I just, at the end of it, I see them as a cultist on both sides working together.
[00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:08.908]  Well I think that Hitler, well actually when you think about it, the Zionists were just looking for a place at the table.
[00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:12.250]  What they wanted to do is establish their state in the Middle East.
[00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:18.093]  I think that the globalists are basically just using them to, it's a beachhead in the Middle East.
[00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:21.475]  The Middle East has to be domesticated and that's precisely what they want to do.
[00:18:21.495 --> 00:18:22.115]  You take a look at
[00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:40.808]  Islam does not support usury, does not support the banking industry, and this is one of the last areas that the globals want to take over, and I think that the Zionists are basically just at the table getting what they consider their fair share of what's going on in the Middle East.
[00:18:41.308 --> 00:18:42.089]  Now let's be clear,
[00:18:43.869 --> 00:18:50.555]  Saying that there's multiple parties to this does not give the Zionist a free ride here.
[00:18:51.116 --> 00:19:04.988]  It's intellectually bankrupt, like when I make a film like Terror Storm, exposing that Israel premeditatedly attacked the USS Liberty, and now the NSA documents have come out and it's been totally proven, but we already heard from the pilot and the officers on the ship, we already knew.
[00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:21.575]  I got a lot of heat for making that film from the whole pro-Israel, pro-war Zionist camp, but then conversely I got heat saying because I pointed out that LBJ was involved from the start, and that there was a deal between him and Israel, that I was supposedly giving them a pass.
[00:19:21.655 --> 00:19:23.935]  No, I'm showing the interconnectivity.
[00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.396]  It's like if two guys rob a bank,
[00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:31.864]  To say there were two guys instead of one doesn't say that the one guy isn't just as guilty.
[00:19:32.264 --> 00:19:36.526]  It's giving people the full spectrum, because where did I come about with my ideas about the liberty?
[00:19:37.167 --> 00:19:51.133]  I've interviewed more than twenty, including deceased admirals, Admiral Moore, those interviews are all on the web, Admiral Geist, Admiral Moore, McGonagall before he died over a decade ago, the ship's doctor.
[00:19:51.713 --> 00:19:55.555]  I mean, I've been selling loss of liberty for like seven years now, eight years.
[00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:56.917]  I guess longer than that.
[00:19:57.037 --> 00:20:01.326]  Since it first came out, Tito, the fellow that made it, I've had him on.
[00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:06.155]  So again, I'm trying people to be more complex in their thoughts is what I'm saying.
[00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:08.960]  Well, the Liberty is an interesting situation.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.961]  You know, the Israelis were killing Egyptians.
[00:20:11.021 --> 00:20:16.663]  That's basically what they were doing, and the Liberty was an intelligence ship, and they didn't want them to know that, so that's why they tried to take them out.
[00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:22.886]  Well, not to disagree with you, Kurt, but that's the cover story, and that certainly was going on if Errol Sharom was running the slaughter.
[00:20:23.446 --> 00:20:31.590]  But if you really look at it, and from what I learned from the people that were on the ship, what they later found out, that they wanted to blame an attack on Egypt.
[00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:37.913]  And that it was like killing two birds with one stone, and that they wanted to go ahead and start World War III.
[00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:39.514]  It was kind of a Gulf of Tonkin Part II.
[00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:42.876]  Yeah, I'm not aware of that.
[00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:49.733]  You know what, we have listeners that can do this because I'm so busy that you see how small the crew is here.
[00:20:49.773 --> 00:20:51.174]  We're so busy we never have a chance to do it.
[00:20:51.474 --> 00:21:05.443]  Somebody ought to go dig up the twenty-plus interviews I've done and make transcripts of it and maybe piece it together as an article from the quotes of the people who were on the ship because that's where I got all that was from them.
[00:21:06.344 --> 00:21:09.806]  And they would correct me and say, no, no, we don't think it was just about the massacre.
[00:21:09.866 --> 00:21:12.508]  We think it was about attacking Egypt.
[00:21:13.328 --> 00:21:15.009]  And again, what do you see in Operation Northwood?
[00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:16.989]  You sink your own ship and blame it on an enemy.
[00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:19.350]  Well, it's a standard false flag operation.
[00:21:20.211 --> 00:21:21.151]  Standard false flag.
[00:21:23.272 --> 00:21:25.633]  What do you think is going to happen if they do attack?
[00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.812]  Oh, the Middle East will go up in flames.
[00:21:29.872 --> 00:21:31.754]  I mean, Iran is not Iraq.
[00:21:32.615 --> 00:21:35.777]  They're far much more military ready.
[00:21:36.198 --> 00:21:41.703]  They have a military that's ready to go, whereas Iraq was in shambles after 12 years of sanctions.
[00:21:42.444 --> 00:21:43.785]  So it'll be a mess.
[00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:44.666]  It'll be a mess.
[00:21:44.686 --> 00:21:46.187]  And I think the neocons want it to be a mess.
[00:21:46.227 --> 00:21:46.648]  I really do.
[00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:56.038]  That's right, create a crisis so big that we have to get behind it because America's losing and they've blown up our carriers.
[00:21:56.579 --> 00:21:58.502]  They said they had 11,000 missiles.
[00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:19.815]  Aimed at our ships, and then the Pentagon keeps ordering the Navy to bring them up within missile range, and the Navy said, if you push our ships back ten more miles, we wouldn't be in range of these short-range missiles, now that they've got the Sunburns and others.
[00:22:20.656 --> 00:22:23.517]  And so that's another reason, and Fox Fallon quit.
[00:22:23.838 --> 00:22:26.359]  He can smell, he can smell they're getting ready for a false flag.
[00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:32.042]  Well, if you take a look at the philosophy of the neocons, and you pointed out Plato, it's exactly what it is, is they
[00:22:33.303 --> 00:22:37.865]  They want to create a crisis that they can force the country to get involved in.
[00:22:38.225 --> 00:22:39.486]  They tried to do that with Iraq.
[00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:40.787]  It turned out to be a fiasco.
[00:22:40.867 --> 00:22:42.007]  It's a total mess over there.
[00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:48.610]  With Iran, they want to just increase and intensify that ability to rally the American people.
[00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.652]  And you saw at first how the American people went for the Iraq war.
[00:22:55.364 --> 00:22:56.745]  They'll do the same thing with Iran.
[00:22:57.505 --> 00:22:58.705]  But it's like a heroin addict.
[00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:02.327]  They've got to take bigger and bigger dosages and it has lesser and less effect.
[00:23:02.667 --> 00:23:08.929]  It's like an alcoholic who couldn't drink three shots of whiskey when they started out and now they're drinking 20 shots and can't get a buzz.
[00:23:11.735 --> 00:23:13.116]  I mean, I think that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:23:13.256 --> 00:23:14.978]  Well, it's going to be a mess, either way.
[00:23:15.418 --> 00:23:27.468]  They'll have to, and it'll be dumped in Hillary or Obama or whoever gets elected, elected, selected to be the next president, will be dumped in their lap, and there's really no difference between the neocons and the neoliberals.
[00:23:28.009 --> 00:23:29.570]  They disagree on certain things.
[00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:32.253]  You see, the neocons are pretty much pro-Israeli.
[00:23:32.913 --> 00:23:37.897]  I think that the Rockefeller so-called Eastern Establishment neoliberals don't really care about Israel so much.
[00:23:38.858 --> 00:23:41.780]  No, but they love war.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.220]  They just love it.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:49.164]  The defense industry feeds into that, the national security state feeds into that, and it just keeps them going.
[00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:55.007]  And regardless, we know what the policy is, we know they're going ahead with it, and we need to stop it.
[00:23:55.027 --> 00:23:59.349]  Do you think the old stage is some type of provocation before they go in?
[00:23:59.489 --> 00:24:01.050]  Another Gulf of Tonkin situation?
[00:24:02.817 --> 00:24:03.958]  Not sure if they will or not.
[00:24:04.018 --> 00:24:04.939]  They may just attack.
[00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:17.449]  The premise of the whole so-called nuclear, Iran supposedly making nukes, which they're not, is a sort of Golf of Tonkin situation that they can't pan out.
[00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:19.871]  They might come up with a terrorist situation.
[00:24:20.411 --> 00:24:31.000]  More than likely what they'll do is they'll continue this effort to make it look like Iran is supporting the Shia militias in southern Iraq, and that's basically where they'll go with it.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.884]  They'll try to make it look like that Iran's involved in Iraqi's internal affairs, which they're not.
[00:24:36.785 --> 00:24:37.545]  Not to that extent.
[00:24:39.467 --> 00:24:42.890]  Well, we are seeing what can only be described as Hitlerian.
[00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:46.073]  I keep saying Hitlerian because he did run around and invade a bunch of countries.
[00:24:47.162 --> 00:24:50.864]  That's the last time we've seen this type of... Well, that's not true.
[00:24:50.904 --> 00:24:59.148]  We saw the Russians pour into the Eastern Europe and Southern Europe, but... Central Europe.
[00:25:00.428 --> 00:25:04.911]  But that was a slow thing over the decades in funding revolutions and then rolling in.
[00:25:05.351 --> 00:25:11.214]  I think this is the first time we've seen real imperial invasion since what Hitler did.
[00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:21.927]  I think as well the United States and their Israeli allies want to take out Iran as a modern state and do the same thing they did in Iraq, reduce it to rubble.
[00:25:21.947 --> 00:25:22.527]  Or Serbia.
[00:25:23.248 --> 00:25:23.928]  Or Serbia.
[00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:29.873]  And they bomb their entire infrastructure, water treatment, power plants, manufacturing facilities, factories.
[00:25:29.893 --> 00:25:30.714]  It's not going to work.
[00:25:31.434 --> 00:25:32.095]  It's not going to work.
[00:25:32.115 --> 00:25:35.738]  It just won't work.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.721]  They just don't want anybody being industrialized that isn't under the globalist control.
[00:25:40.561 --> 00:25:42.242]  And the Iranians will fight back.
[00:25:42.282 --> 00:25:48.404]  They're not going to be... The Iraqis, once again, we have to... Stay there, stay there.
[00:25:48.424 --> 00:25:49.564]  Tell us more about it when we get back.
[00:25:49.944 --> 00:25:51.045]  Curt Nimmo is our guest.
[00:25:52.005 --> 00:25:52.905]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:25:53.065 --> 00:25:53.565]  Stay with us.
[00:25:56.246 --> 00:25:57.647]  It is a big idea.
[00:25:57.667 --> 00:25:59.767]  A new world order.
[00:26:00.488 --> 00:26:04.769]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:26:05.385 --> 00:26:07.528]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:26:08.209 --> 00:26:10.431]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:26:10.992 --> 00:26:13.435]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:26:14.176 --> 00:26:21.505]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:29.479]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:26:29.959 --> 00:26:33.421]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:26:33.841 --> 00:26:36.303]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:26:36.403 --> 00:26:37.543]  Most people have no idea.
[00:26:37.563 --> 00:26:38.324]  They're not after money.
[00:26:38.344 --> 00:26:39.424]  They have all the money they need.
[00:26:39.625 --> 00:26:40.185]  They're after power.
[00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:41.286]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:57.097]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:27:57.417 --> 00:28:00.858]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:28:01.038 --> 00:28:02.919]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:28:03.499 --> 00:28:06.261]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:28:06.561 --> 00:28:12.063]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:28:12.343 --> 00:28:16.285]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:29:43.609 --> 00:29:46.870]  Day after day Alone on a hill The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
[00:30:13.134 --> 00:30:35.406]  Everybody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round
[00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:39.708]  We're going to go to some calls.
[00:30:39.888 --> 00:30:42.011]  George Hopper's coming in as well.
[00:30:42.031 --> 00:30:46.657]  But finishing up with Iraq, you were trying to make a point before we went into that break.
[00:30:47.662 --> 00:30:53.527]  Well yeah, you take a look at what Israel did in southern Lebanon, it's basically the same thing the United States did in Iraq.
[00:30:53.807 --> 00:31:03.356]  Take out their infrastructure, make a massive refugee problem, and just basically break down the social and cultural aspects of the country.
[00:31:03.416 --> 00:31:06.639]  But it didn't work in Lebanon because Hezbollah was far too organized.
[00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:10.842]  So they're going to try to do the same thing in Iran, but it's not going to work.
[00:31:11.003 --> 00:31:11.883]  It's just not going to work.
[00:31:12.224 --> 00:31:14.325]  It'll be Hezbollah on steroids.
[00:31:15.276 --> 00:31:17.957]  But how is that not us becoming the bad guys?
[00:31:18.037 --> 00:31:23.918]  You know, the United States to go in and destroy Iraq, for 17 years it's been under siege, since 1991.
[00:31:24.518 --> 00:31:30.600]  Three million Iraqis are dead, over a million in the last five years of the liberation.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:39.262]  And al-Sadr made a deal and didn't attack, so they sneak attack him, so that he couldn't be part of the election, and then basically admit it, and then say he's Al-Qaeda.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.304]  Well, I think the American people really don't care so much.
[00:31:42.344 --> 00:31:43.265]  They're too distracted.
[00:31:43.325 --> 00:31:45.628]  They're not politically savvy.
[00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:48.212]  They don't know about this kind of stuff, so it really doesn't matter.
[00:31:48.613 --> 00:31:50.175]  And plus, these guys are arrogant.
[00:31:50.195 --> 00:31:51.117]  They'll do whatever they want.
[00:31:53.504 --> 00:31:58.768]  So, you know, I think the whole Iran thing will be a total fiasco for them.
[00:31:59.169 --> 00:32:03.853]  It'll be Iraq on steroids as far as the resistance goes.
[00:32:04.533 --> 00:32:07.175]  And this will be war for another decade.
[00:32:07.736 --> 00:32:11.579]  And I think the neocons realize this to a certain extent, and that's precisely what they want to do.
[00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:16.323]  They want to rally this country and turn it into a war state, more so than it is already.
[00:32:17.124 --> 00:32:18.705]  And that's what 9-11 was all about.
[00:32:18.745 --> 00:32:19.886]  It's the same thing all over again.
[00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:21.007]  No, that's it, exactly.
[00:32:21.047 --> 00:32:26.772]  And then arrest you if you criticize it, ban free speech, wiretaps on everybody.
[00:32:26.792 --> 00:32:32.237]  They're just announcing everything that's 180 degrees the opposite of what the United States is supposed to be about.
[00:32:32.557 --> 00:32:36.680]  Right, and they can usher in their control grid, and it's a perfect excuse to do so.
[00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:39.460]  And then stage more terror attacks along the way.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.821]  Right, right.
[00:32:41.221 --> 00:32:50.730]  And on top of that, overlay a bunch of propaganda, by the way, the corporate media, and a lot of Americans will buy it, unfortunately, because they intellectually are not up to speed on this stuff.
[00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:51.491]  Well, there is hope.
[00:32:51.531 --> 00:32:58.377]  I mean, in the process of all of this, the government's gone from a two-party system, people being fooled by one party, and then four years later, the next party.
[00:32:58.997 --> 00:33:00.578]  That's not happening now.
[00:33:00.598 --> 00:33:02.859]  11% approval ratings are lower in some cases.
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.881]  People may not know the details, but they know they're being lied to.
[00:33:07.362 --> 00:33:08.642]  And I don't think they're going to get away with it.
[00:33:08.662 --> 00:33:10.083]  I think they've bit off more than they can choose.
[00:33:11.584 --> 00:33:15.646]  I agree with people like Mike Rivera, who thinks it's just going to collapse like the Soviet Union.
[00:33:16.047 --> 00:33:16.987]  I would have to agree with that.
[00:33:17.787 --> 00:33:20.069]  Unfortunately, in the process, a lot of people will get hurt.
[00:33:20.529 --> 00:33:22.030]  A lot of people will be ushered off to camps.
[00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.031]  A lot of people may be even, I hate to say it, killed.
[00:33:27.042 --> 00:33:28.045]  These guys aren't going to give up.
[00:33:28.407 --> 00:33:29.771]  They're just going to keep rolling.
[00:33:30.674 --> 00:33:32.379]  And it's up to us to stop them.
[00:33:33.442 --> 00:33:38.167]  Well, a lot of it is that if you study elites and elite psychology throughout history, they're bored.
[00:33:38.527 --> 00:33:43.052]  They're tired of hookers and money and helicopters and palaces and ski resorts.
[00:33:43.512 --> 00:33:48.577]  They like war maps and evil stuff and killing people and assassinations.
[00:33:49.018 --> 00:33:49.919]  It's fun for them, Kurt.
[00:33:49.979 --> 00:33:50.839]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:33:50.859 --> 00:33:56.765]  Well, they're sociopaths and psychopaths and they're power freaks, so, you know, that's exactly what they'll do.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.201]  Absolutely.
[00:33:58.221 --> 00:33:59.241]  We've got time to go to a call.
[00:33:59.261 --> 00:34:01.403]  We'll take some more calls after the break and then George is going to be coming up.
[00:34:01.443 --> 00:34:03.145]  Mike in Canada, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:34:04.586 --> 00:34:05.486]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[00:34:05.727 --> 00:34:06.067]  Good sir.
[00:34:06.788 --> 00:34:07.008]  Good.
[00:34:07.828 --> 00:34:19.658]  I just wanted to say, you know, I learned how to read when I was three and the first thing I saw was Christmas presents from Santa Claus under the Christmas tree before Christmas.
[00:34:19.738 --> 00:34:20.679]  And ever since then,
[00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:22.281]  I don't know.
[00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.291]  Well, everyone doesn't believe it.
[00:34:39.311 --> 00:34:43.012]  There's an illusion that you know the truth, but that nobody else knows it.
[00:34:43.272 --> 00:34:47.433]  That's the final illusion that has to fall, is that we're all alone or we're the minority.
[00:34:47.714 --> 00:34:52.435]  We are actually the majority, but we are not motivated, we are not as outspoken.
[00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:55.776]  We have to get the majority to stand up and take action.
[00:34:56.356 --> 00:34:56.937]  Definitely.
[00:34:57.757 --> 00:35:05.980]  For sure, but I try to wake somebody up every day as to what's going on, and any topic like
[00:35:07.449 --> 00:35:12.710]  The USS Liberty, Pearl Harbor, all kinds of things that are easy to prove.
[00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:19.192]  And it's unbelievable how much effort it takes to wake somebody up to something like that.
[00:35:20.592 --> 00:35:21.972]  I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[00:35:22.012 --> 00:35:22.933]  Just keep it up, sir.
[00:35:22.953 --> 00:35:26.714]  Hey, they certainly got egg on their face about the USS Liberty.
[00:35:27.954 --> 00:35:34.635]  I mean, the Chicago Tribune and others reported the NSA document that our government intercepted it when they said just what the pilot said.
[00:35:34.975 --> 00:35:36.896]  Three times refused to attack and was told do it.
[00:35:38.996 --> 00:35:39.997]  I mean, that's an American.
[00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:40.939]  I'm not gonna attack.
[00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:41.379]  Attack.
[00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:42.040]  That's an American.
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:42.761]  I'm not gonna attack.
[00:35:43.102 --> 00:35:43.763]  We'll be right back.
[00:35:45.906 --> 00:35:46.807]  We're on the march.
[00:35:47.287 --> 00:35:48.890]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:35:49.831 --> 00:35:52.515]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:55.683 --> 00:35:58.907]  Someday, cancer, diabetes, and poor health may disrupt your life.
[00:35:59.067 --> 00:36:01.871]  Are you going to be the one in four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:05.776]  Well, now, you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with AlkaVita.
[00:36:05.956 --> 00:36:12.645]  AlkaVita is a pure elemental liquid silicon that is high in oxygen and highly alkaline to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[00:36:12.705 --> 00:36:13.285]  I'm good.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:31.800]  I think so.
[00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:56.101]  Greetings!
[00:36:56.221 --> 00:36:59.602]  I am Dr. Buell Bonshite with the White Paper Comicals.
[00:36:59.862 --> 00:37:08.185]  Mr. Steve Shank with this fearless radio program is correct when he says the solution to our difficult times is to store food and get healthy.
[00:37:08.525 --> 00:37:11.586]  My comrades and I of the media don't want you to panic.
[00:37:11.906 --> 00:37:20.852]  We, unlike Fearless Radio, try not to tell you about the food control legislation, Hurricane Katrina, the American Famine, families unable to buy food.
[00:37:21.152 --> 00:37:29.038]  If we told you the solution to all these problems is food, you'd panic and run out and buy a food before it disappeared, or you couldn't afford it.
[00:37:29.358 --> 00:37:35.702]  You'd completely mess up the perfect strategy for population control, and they'd kick us out of the Survivors Club.
[00:37:35.862 --> 00:37:40.885]  You are a sissy chicken if you call JMSEFoodsDirect.com and order food.
[00:37:41.766 --> 00:37:42.667]  I think so.
[00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:55.986]  Fact.
[00:37:56.167 --> 00:38:02.092]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:38:02.212 --> 00:38:06.477]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:38:06.577 --> 00:38:14.044]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:38:14.264 --> 00:38:14.905]  The solution.
[00:38:15.025 --> 00:38:19.088]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:38:19.268 --> 00:38:28.276]  The Electro Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:38:28.396 --> 00:38:36.403]  Detoxification works with the Electro Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:38:36.603 --> 00:38:40.346]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system,
[00:38:40.566 --> 00:38:41.567]  We're good to go.
[00:39:02.307 --> 00:39:04.628]  We're going to do a live exchange here in a few minutes.
[00:39:04.668 --> 00:39:10.789]  George Humphrey's going to come in and Kurt's going to go, but we're keeping Kurt in case your questions are for him just a few more minutes.
[00:39:11.369 --> 00:39:14.130]  Mark in Florida disagrees, so he goes to the head of the line.
[00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.531]  We'll get to Gary, Sam, George, Daniel and others.
[00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:17.671]  Mark, you're on the air.
[00:39:18.751 --> 00:39:24.272]  Yeah, Alex, my question about the UN is why threw the baby out with the bathwater?
[00:39:24.292 --> 00:39:26.013]  The Constitution in Article 6
[00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:27.371]  That's good.
[00:39:40.932 --> 00:39:43.953]  So I think we should probably take it very seriously.
[00:39:44.233 --> 00:39:48.874]  Well, we're allowed to break charters and agreements, but the globalists created the UN.
[00:39:49.234 --> 00:39:53.995]  Our government acts like they're against their policies, because those policies are unpopular, by and large, here.
[00:39:54.315 --> 00:39:55.976]  But the globalists created the UN.
[00:39:55.996 --> 00:40:01.037]  I mean, have you read their 30 unanimous declaration on human rights?
[00:40:01.057 --> 00:40:03.217]  They're supposed to be law.
[00:40:03.337 --> 00:40:05.218]  It says you have no rights in 29 and 30.
[00:40:06.818 --> 00:40:08.399]  I mean, the UN... Sir, let me stop you.
[00:40:08.439 --> 00:40:10.981]  The UN ran the murder, as we told you ten years ago.
[00:40:11.421 --> 00:40:13.982]  Plus, but it's now come out that the UN ran the murder.
[00:40:14.263 --> 00:40:15.884]  They didn't let it happen in Rwanda.
[00:40:16.224 --> 00:40:17.425]  They ran the murder.
[00:40:17.465 --> 00:40:18.585]  I see you nodding your head, Kurt.
[00:40:19.806 --> 00:40:21.007]  Absolutely.
[00:40:21.027 --> 00:40:21.007]  100%.
[00:40:21.927 --> 00:40:22.208]  They did.
[00:40:22.748 --> 00:40:24.569]  So that's really my question to you.
[00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:29.832]  I mean, is it a totally depraved organization at this point?
[00:40:29.852 --> 00:40:33.735]  Because I hear you talking about things like white slave rings and
[00:40:34.917 --> 00:40:43.021]  I don't know what, maybe it's estriol that goes into the tetanus injections, E3, and these kind of things all being run from the UN.
[00:40:43.461 --> 00:40:47.063]  Is it completely depraved, or is there something that's salvageable?
[00:40:47.203 --> 00:40:54.467]  I mean, you know, when somebody like... Yeah, there's one of the top guys on the UN Human Rights Committee.
[00:40:54.527 --> 00:40:57.288]  It's a good question, let me answer it off-air with you guys.
[00:40:57.308 --> 00:40:58.269]  I mean, it's a very good point.
[00:41:04.232 --> 00:41:05.634]  There's good people in the FBI.
[00:41:05.894 --> 00:41:07.135]  There's good people in the CIA.
[00:41:07.155 --> 00:41:08.257]  There's good people in the U.N.
[00:41:08.677 --> 00:41:09.818]  The structure of the U.N.
[00:41:09.858 --> 00:41:10.359]  is a fraud.
[00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:14.844]  Now I said when one of the head guys in a U.N.
[00:41:15.585 --> 00:41:21.111]  Human Rights Committee said that we need to investigate 9-11, it could be an inside job, and he's at Princeton.
[00:41:22.643 --> 00:41:24.264]  That we should use U.N.
[00:41:24.304 --> 00:41:25.364]  committees to investigate.
[00:41:25.404 --> 00:41:27.425]  I think that's always good to have a separation of powers.
[00:41:27.966 --> 00:41:30.267]  It's just that they don't have any governmental power to come over here.
[00:41:30.887 --> 00:41:34.329]  And I said when 9-11 happened, they'd probably have it finally come out in the U.N.
[00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:35.409]  that the U.S.
[00:41:35.429 --> 00:41:37.090]  was involved, but then act like the U.S.
[00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:41.312]  ran it all to demonize nationality, nationalism in the U.S.
[00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:42.973]  I mean, Kurt, you've been listening for years.
[00:41:42.993 --> 00:41:44.134]  How many times have I said that would happen?
[00:41:44.334 --> 00:41:44.874]  All the time.
[00:41:44.954 --> 00:41:50.917]  I mean, the thing with the United Nations is I would be all for them if they would adopt our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:41:50.977 --> 00:41:51.798]  I'd have no problem with them.
[00:41:52.418 --> 00:41:52.858]  But they don't.
[00:41:53.359 --> 00:41:56.341]  Like Alex said, it's a privilege.
[00:41:56.662 --> 00:41:58.903]  Their rights are granted under privilege.
[00:41:59.364 --> 00:42:02.967]  I mean, I have no problem if countries want to get together on a voluntary basis.
[00:42:03.567 --> 00:42:06.810]  The problem is the UN goes into countries that aren't even signatories and bombs them.
[00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:09.092]  I mean, the UN is a murder force.
[00:42:09.552 --> 00:42:12.014]  And they've got all this nice PR and over-helping black kids.
[00:42:12.074 --> 00:42:14.517]  It's a eugenics arm to carry out evil.
[00:42:15.217 --> 00:42:16.878]  Now, are there different members of the U.N.
[00:42:16.898 --> 00:42:17.698]  that are good?
[00:42:17.718 --> 00:42:19.558]  Does some good stuff come out of the U.N.?
[00:42:19.878 --> 00:42:23.079]  Yeah, I mean, a broken clock is right twice a day, a blind hog can find acorns.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.420]  You know, that is the reality.
[00:42:28.001 --> 00:42:31.362]  But, you know, that's a debate, a bigger discussion we ought to have on air sometime.
[00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:34.483]  Every cliché and under the sun, Kurt, that's what I do here.
[00:42:35.443 --> 00:42:37.123]  Let's go ahead and take one more call for you.
[00:42:37.423 --> 00:42:39.044]  Gary in Maine, you're on the air with Kurt Nemo.
[00:42:40.064 --> 00:42:42.825]  Hi Alex, I just have a little article here that
[00:42:45.127 --> 00:42:46.108]  That should be heads up.
[00:42:46.608 --> 00:42:53.813]  And it says here, last night's session was only the fourth in 176 years that Congress closed its doors to the public.
[00:42:55.134 --> 00:42:57.275]  And they discussed about the imminent collapse of the U.S.
[00:42:57.315 --> 00:42:58.516]  economy curve September 2008.
[00:42:58.816 --> 00:43:04.140]  The imminent collapse of the federal government finances by February 2009.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.862]  And I got this off in a crash.
[00:43:07.962 --> 00:43:08.523]  Are you ready?
[00:43:10.208 --> 00:43:11.909]  Yeah, they've got a show here on the network.
[00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:13.951]  I'll have to look that up.
[00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.052]  What's the headline on that story?
[00:43:16.192 --> 00:43:21.597]  Last night's session was only the fourth time in 176 years that Congress... Yeah, but that wasn't last night.
[00:43:21.637 --> 00:43:23.218]  The Congress wasn't in session last night.
[00:43:23.258 --> 00:43:24.599]  It was two weeks ago.
[00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:26.920]  It was March 13, 2008.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.882]  Yeah, it was a few weeks ago.
[00:43:30.803 --> 00:43:31.724]  Okay, we'll look into that.
[00:43:31.744 --> 00:43:35.587]  I've had people raise that to me, and I've seen something about their closed session of Congress.
[00:43:36.287 --> 00:43:36.748]  Anything else?
[00:43:37.985 --> 00:43:46.249]  Also, they're going to try to put the NAFTA superhighway through western Maine into the eastern part of Maine.
[00:43:46.269 --> 00:43:49.991]  2,000 foot corridor right through the state.
[00:43:51.092 --> 00:43:52.932]  I saw it on the Portland Press Herald.
[00:43:53.413 --> 00:43:57.915]  Yeah, but if you talk to your neighbors about it, the media will say it doesn't exist as they put the toll roads on the road.
[00:43:58.495 --> 00:43:59.876]  Yeah, they probably will.
[00:44:00.322 --> 00:44:01.223]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[00:44:01.643 --> 00:44:06.507]  You know, that's something we see a lot, Kurt, where... I use this example a lot, because it happened a few months ago.
[00:44:06.547 --> 00:44:08.228]  Ron Paul was talking about the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:44:08.948 --> 00:44:12.891]  And CNN and Fox, we played the clips, said, those don't exist.
[00:44:12.911 --> 00:44:13.472]  He's crazy.
[00:44:14.252 --> 00:44:21.398]  I mean, they even say the Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist, and the billboards are everywhere, and they're taking over the roads, and the legislature told Perry not to do it, but he's still doing it.
[00:44:22.098 --> 00:44:24.800]  I mean, that's like saying that yellow school buses don't exist.
[00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.523]  It's just... We know that's a psychological tactic.
[00:44:28.563 --> 00:44:29.344]  Why do you think they do that?
[00:44:30.051 --> 00:44:32.012]  Well, because most of the country doesn't live in Texas.
[00:44:32.072 --> 00:44:34.794]  I mean, they can say whatever they want.
[00:44:34.895 --> 00:44:36.596]  Most people don't pay attention, unfortunately.
[00:44:37.917 --> 00:44:38.577]  They're oblivious.
[00:44:38.777 --> 00:44:41.219]  There's also, it wears you out.
[00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:42.440]  There's so many lies.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.701]  You kind of get fatigued to it.
[00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:44.882]  You just go, okay, they lie.
[00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.503]  It's like you accept that they lie.
[00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.250]  That's very dangerous that we just accept that they're a bunch of liars.
[00:44:50.691 --> 00:44:51.351]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:44:51.591 --> 00:44:52.011]  Absolutely.
[00:44:52.451 --> 00:45:13.315]  Most people, like I said, most people don't understand what's going on, and they have a lot of people believe what the government says, unfortunately, and believe what the corporate media says, and when they say things like, well, it doesn't exist, it puts a seed of doubt in their mind about, you know, us, the so-called conspiracy theorists, who believe in this stuff, who know it's reality.
[00:45:15.216 --> 00:45:20.859]  Well I agree with you and the good news is that I remember Rush Limbaugh and I believed him.
[00:45:22.284 --> 00:45:32.127]  I remember Rush Limbaugh when I was in high school, like 18 years ago, was on the air here in Austin on 590 AM, and I remember him saying, there's no such thing as a CFR.
[00:45:32.967 --> 00:45:42.750]  But I had watched C-SPAN, and even back then people talk about the CFR, and I'd been into politics, so I'd read about it, and I thought, that's what woke me up, that he was a liar.
[00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:45.331]  Now he says the CFR doesn't run anything.
[00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:47.911]  But I remember him saying it didn't exist over and over again.
[00:45:50.407 --> 00:45:53.449]  You know, the fact that they just lie so much, I think, is really going to sink them.
[00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:55.030]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:02.215]  You know, Rush Limbaugh has millions of listeners, so people believe, you know, they cling on his every word, so they're going to believe what he says.
[00:46:02.335 --> 00:46:09.560]  And once the reality comes out that the CFR is actually an existing organization, then they turn that around and say, well, they really don't have any power.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:19.387]  You hear them say, it's just a think tank, you know, it's just a bunch of eggheads getting together and talking about foreign policy, when we know that they're basically the guys who run the show.
[00:46:21.957 --> 00:46:22.478]  Absolutely.
[00:46:22.518 --> 00:46:24.159]  Curt Nemo, it's been great having you here in studio.
[00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:26.041]  I'm going to have you pop back in tomorrow.
[00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:26.721]  Thanks for coming in.
[00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:27.302]  Thanks, man.
[00:46:28.543 --> 00:46:29.744]  Now let's bring in George Humphrey.
[00:46:31.665 --> 00:46:33.927]  And we will continue with your phone calls throughout this hour.
[00:46:34.808 --> 00:46:43.676]  And then into the next hour, we're going to have George Humphrey with us now into the new fourth hour overdrive section of the show.
[00:46:44.889 --> 00:47:03.135]  And I want to remind listeners that are listening at Infowars.com right now, or on the AM or FM dial, or Global Shortwave, the internet satellite, however, that the fourth hour is available at Infowars.com, not just with the audio free to everybody in 32-bit, but in 64-bit for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:47:04.636 --> 00:47:07.377]  All available at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:07.857 --> 00:47:09.997]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, it is 15 cents.
[00:47:13.246 --> 00:47:13.686]  A day.
[00:47:14.127 --> 00:47:17.809]  If you get a yearly membership, you get three months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:47:18.089 --> 00:47:20.531]  So we leave the Genesis Network here in about 20 minutes.
[00:47:21.011 --> 00:47:22.692]  To be precise, about 19 minutes.
[00:47:23.413 --> 00:47:36.041]  And we will continue with your phone calls, continue with the news, continue with the information with George Humphrey, former city council member, degreed economist, successful businessman, father, author, and documentary filmmaker.
[00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:41.104]  And it is just really fabulous to have George here in studio with us.
[00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:41.805]  George, thanks for coming in.
[00:47:42.225 --> 00:47:44.225]  Alex, it's always good to see you, brother.
[00:47:45.306 --> 00:47:50.807]  Every time I come down here, the energy in this office is just getting better and better and better.
[00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:58.488]  I'll tell you what, you can really tell a lot about a person by who they work with and who they spend time with.
[00:47:58.528 --> 00:48:05.249]  Your staff, the guys and the people who work in this office, are so dedicated.
[00:48:05.709 --> 00:48:10.330]  They love this nation and they're just busting their tails to make this a better country.
[00:48:11.151 --> 00:48:12.474]  Congratulations to you.
[00:48:12.534 --> 00:48:14.459]  It's a great reflection to you and to them.
[00:48:15.281 --> 00:48:16.383]  Congratulations, Alex.
[00:48:16.403 --> 00:48:18.448]  You're directly in the New World Order's sights.
[00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:20.831]  Well, we all are.
[00:48:20.871 --> 00:48:24.633]  We've been in the New York World Order sites since we were born.
[00:48:24.673 --> 00:48:25.373]  But you know what?
[00:48:25.493 --> 00:48:27.214]  That makes life a lot more fun.
[00:48:28.015 --> 00:48:33.838]  And you and I both know that the perfect storm is brewing.
[00:48:34.799 --> 00:48:37.781]  We're getting ready to have an economic tsunami.
[00:48:37.861 --> 00:48:44.905]  And as an economist, I keep looking at this stuff and researching it and talking to more and more and more people.
[00:48:45.585 --> 00:48:56.034]  In every day, and in every way, our slave masters, the people who control the Fed, keep making blunders.
[00:48:56.074 --> 00:49:00.138]  And they're actually not blunders, because I think it's very intentional.
[00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:05.703]  They are destroying, absolutely destroying the foundation of the economy of this country.
[00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:12.729]  And I want to talk about what is going on economically, but I also want to talk about, later on in the show,
[00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:31.779]  You and I can scare the pants off of ourselves and everybody else, but the real question is, as truthers, as people who love this country, people who believe in the Republic, who believe in God, what are we going to do and how are we going to go through this thing called the shift?
[00:49:32.359 --> 00:49:39.206]  To make sure that not just our grandchildren and our children, but you and I, we come out the other end of the tunnel.
[00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:45.653]  George, I don't necessarily agree that, like the people in India or the Buddhists think, because they've thought that before, that we're going into a good shift.
[00:49:46.014 --> 00:49:47.295]  How do you know we're not going into hell?
[00:49:47.515 --> 00:49:48.976]  Well, we could be.
[00:49:49.076 --> 00:49:49.856]  It's up to us.
[00:49:50.356 --> 00:50:09.544]  And the real question is, we are creators in this world, and it's up to people like you and I and every single person who's listening to make the choice about what kind of country and what kind of world and what kind of family and what kind of health
[00:50:10.104 --> 00:50:23.556]  They're going to have, because we are co-creators, and if we continue to sit on our butts collectively and keep watching the Super Bowl and drinking beer and getting fat, well, we are in hell right now.
[00:50:23.876 --> 00:50:24.637]  But you know what?
[00:50:24.837 --> 00:50:31.623]  With people like you, and with all the other good, good, good loving patriots around the country and the world,
[00:50:32.143 --> 00:50:34.645]  I'm seeing some positive signals.
[00:50:34.685 --> 00:50:46.792]  Now, clearly the dark signals are as strong or stronger now than they've ever been, but every day I'm seeing really positive things that are happening, and a lot of it is because of people like you.
[00:50:47.773 --> 00:50:57.038]  Well, George, I've been getting into positive thinking, and I want to get into what you, as an economist, where you think the economy's going, some hard issues first, and then we can get into trying to shift our paradigm, which I agree with.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:02.802]  I mean, they are trying to wreck the economy by design.
[00:51:02.822 --> 00:51:09.890]  Yeah, and the fact is, friends, is our nation, national economy, is ruined.
[00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.834]  It is absolutely ruined, and we'll go through it bit by bit.
[00:51:17.937 --> 00:51:36.503]  And we're not going to be able to fix what we have right now, but we will be able to come through it, because our founding fathers were clear enough that they wanted, in this country, they wanted an economy based upon a currency that was publicly owned.
[00:51:36.803 --> 00:51:37.083]  I think.
[00:51:58.525 --> 00:52:05.489]  And the fundamentals that we're looking at make 1929 look like a walk in the park.
[00:52:05.609 --> 00:52:20.197]  The situations that we have as far as the fundamentals of the economics of this nation are far worse than any nation, far worse than they were in Rome at the fall of the Roman Empire.
[00:52:20.877 --> 00:52:23.641]  They're worse than when the British Empire fell.
[00:52:24.202 --> 00:52:25.203]  They're far worse than in 1929.
[00:52:25.784 --> 00:52:30.731]  Well, as an economist, break down the basic facts and how it was designed.
[00:52:30.751 --> 00:52:33.535]  We have the IMF's own documents to consolidate all wealth.
[00:52:33.595 --> 00:52:35.718]  It is a mathematical black hole.
[00:52:36.158 --> 00:52:38.499]  That is billions of times all the real assets.
[00:52:38.799 --> 00:52:43.041]  They create the tsunami, and then they deluge everything, then they pose as the savior.
[00:52:43.081 --> 00:52:56.828]  Just like the Federal Reserve has engineered all this, as the regional bank, and then now they're the savior, and they say, get rid of any controls over us, give us full federal power, make us absolute gods of the government, not just parts of the government who are private, and everything will be okay.
[00:52:57.028 --> 00:53:12.106]  Well, after 15 years of having a television show and after having done hundreds and hundreds of radio shows, and I know you've done not hundreds, you've done thousands and thousands of shows and talked about the Fed, more and more people are aware of it right now.
[00:53:12.186 --> 00:53:14.729]  But the fact is, and just this last week,
[00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:25.999]  I had lunch with four or five top brokers from around the state who were all making between $500,000 to over a million dollars, and they were bright, bright guys.
[00:53:26.039 --> 00:53:26.960]  They love this country.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.203]  They had no idea about the Federal Reserve.
[00:53:30.703 --> 00:53:33.824]  They had no idea about the Plunge Protection Team.
[00:53:34.244 --> 00:53:38.305]  They had no idea about the vast, vast manipulation.
[00:53:38.345 --> 00:53:54.130]  They had no idea that our banking system was put in as Article 1 of the Constitution, because our founding fathers knew that to have a free country, we had to have a free and balanced economic system, which we do not.
[00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:55.891]  Now, clearly, as
[00:53:56.511 --> 00:54:12.221]  Probably, I would say, probably 95% of your listeners know the Federal Reserve Banking System is neither federal, there are no reserves, it is a private corporation controlled by European financiers that are called black shareholders.
[00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:15.843]  It has never, ever, ever been audited.
[00:54:15.923 --> 00:54:20.726]  The GAO has come out on several occasions and said it's never been audited.
[00:54:21.386 --> 00:54:37.673]  And it is basically a Ponzi scheme, as you've said a thousand times, to transfer, to siphon wealth from the productive middle class, not the guy making $250,000 or $500,000 or a million a year.
[00:54:37.913 --> 00:54:40.474]  We're talking about the ultra, ultra elite.
[00:54:40.534 --> 00:54:44.496]  Yeah, the general public thinks somebody with a good golf membership and a Mercedes is the elite.
[00:54:45.437 --> 00:54:51.341]  They're not even gnats on the back end of the machine of the power elite.
[00:54:51.381 --> 00:54:54.303]  The power elite issue trillions in credits.
[00:54:54.643 --> 00:54:58.686]  If you're a billionaire today, they don't let you in the front door.
[00:54:58.726 --> 00:55:13.357]  They might let you come in the back door and pamper you for a little bit, but the names that we hear about Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, these fellows, yes they are very, very wealthy, but they are not the wealthiest people in the world.
[00:55:14.137 --> 00:55:30.613]  And, you know, this is such an amazing situation, is that the concentration of wealth, the concentration of wealth in this world is so unbelievably lopsided in the hands of a small number of people, and that they are absolutely controlled.
[00:55:30.633 --> 00:55:32.454]  And that's why Bill Joy, when he went to that
[00:55:33.115 --> 00:55:33.996]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:55:45.976 --> 00:55:48.337]  Bill Joy, you know, you covered it on your axis show.
[00:55:48.677 --> 00:56:01.160]  I remember back at the time, but he said, yeah, the elite don't need the public anymore with robotics and construction and they see us as a liability and the elite are planning to go ahead and just kill everybody.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.440]  And so, you know, we have to talk about that darkness.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:10.922]  I'm not trying to be negative, but we need to know, yeah, we've got all this goodness and we want to be happy and free and, you know, it's a beautiful day out there.
[00:56:10.942 --> 00:56:12.642]  This is one of the most beautiful springs I've ever seen.
[00:56:13.262 --> 00:56:14.263]  It's unbelievable.
[00:56:14.443 --> 00:56:15.463]  It's magic outside.
[00:56:15.683 --> 00:56:18.965]  Meanwhile, I've got to be in here talking about these trolls, but if I don't, they're going to win.
[00:56:19.265 --> 00:56:20.105]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:56:20.946 --> 00:56:34.473]  You know, Alex, what you are doing is so... You know, my hat's been off to you for so long, because you have woken up not thousands, you've woken up hundreds of thousands, if not over a million people in this country who knew nothing about this.
[00:56:35.074 --> 00:56:38.996]  And the fact is, is that for us to survive, we've got to go through two things.
[00:56:39.036 --> 00:56:44.379]  We've got to go through the first awakening, becoming aware of all this crap.
[00:56:44.739 --> 00:56:45.619]  Stay there, we got a break.
[00:56:45.759 --> 00:56:46.859]  I'm back with George Humphrey.
[00:56:47.119 --> 00:56:49.720]  The fourth hour of Overdrive is straight ahead.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.000]  Stay with us.
[00:56:56.001 --> 00:56:57.401]  It is a big idea.
[00:56:57.421 --> 00:56:59.542]  A new world order.
[00:57:00.242 --> 00:57:04.843]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:57:05.143 --> 00:57:07.283]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:57:07.983 --> 00:57:10.183]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:57:10.744 --> 00:57:13.164]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:57:13.932 --> 00:57:21.268]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:57:24.292 --> 00:57:29.275]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:57:29.736 --> 00:57:33.198]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:57:33.598 --> 00:57:36.080]  Build America is making great progress toward a world with our money.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:37.301]  Most people have no idea.
[00:57:37.321 --> 00:57:38.101]  They're not after money.
[00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.182]  They have all the money they need.
[00:57:39.382 --> 00:57:40.103]  They're after power.
[00:57:40.383 --> 00:57:41.223]  That's what they're after.

[01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:03.032]  So that is coming up with our guest.
[01:01:03.412 --> 01:01:04.973]  Now I'm not doing this on purpose, George.
[01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:06.294]  This is at the end.
[01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:09.497]  I've got a few sponsors I plug during the show that I believe in.
[01:01:09.517 --> 01:01:14.682]  And I just remembered that you're really good friends with the owner of this company, Interfood.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:24.629]  A fabulous, fabulous product, and it is absolutely part of the concept of all of us getting better and healthier and stronger.

[01:01:54.954 --> 01:01:57.255]  Yeah, no, I mean, I've had a lot of other green foods that make me feel bad.
[01:01:57.275 --> 01:01:58.196]  Have they got herbs in them?
[01:01:58.416 --> 01:01:59.036]  This isn't herbs.
[01:01:59.056 --> 01:02:01.797]  This is 20 superfoods and you really do absorb it, George.
[01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:07.701]  Yeah, I've used it for years, and the fellows who put it together have the highest integrity.
[01:02:08.242 --> 01:02:12.005]  They're fully on board with everything that you've been talking about for years.
[01:02:12.505 --> 01:02:15.047]  They've been working to make this world a better place.
[01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:16.488]  They're good business people.
[01:02:16.528 --> 01:02:17.289]  They're honest.
[01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:21.872]  And most importantly, the product is a great product.

[01:02:29.007 --> 01:02:29.328]  Oh man.
[01:02:29.608 --> 01:02:32.271]  And it's aired more than 50 times on Showtime.
[01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:33.813]  Everybody's talking about it.
[01:02:33.853 --> 01:02:35.575]  This has three hours of extras on it.
[01:02:35.935 --> 01:02:39.339]  It's discounted out of the gates at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:44.384]  We're about to start the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:47.868]  Again, you need to go on the web, if you're listening there, at Infowars.com.
[01:02:48.188 --> 01:02:50.311]  It's those streams, not the Genesis streams or other streams.
[01:02:50.531 --> 01:02:55.236]  You've got to go to Infowars.com to hear the full hour, commercial-free, with George Humphrey.
[01:02:55.416 --> 01:02:58.379]  But real fast, let's take one quick call before we end this hour.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.481]  Sam in Florida, you've got about a minute and a half.
[01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:00.882]  Go ahead.
[01:03:01.482 --> 01:03:02.544]  Hey, Alex.
[01:03:02.844 --> 01:03:04.446]  Sam here in Florida.
[01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:06.349]  I've been following you for a long time.
[01:03:06.409 --> 01:03:12.756]  Actually, I did research since about 1994 on the World League and everything.
[01:03:13.057 --> 01:03:19.484]  When I ran into you, I actually found one of your videos and I was like, man, this guy's right on.
[01:03:19.784 --> 01:03:22.788]  And you had a lot more information than I did, so I started following you.
[01:03:23.268 --> 01:03:26.592]  Anyway, what I wanted to ask was, do you think
[01:03:27.422 --> 01:03:40.710]  Um, the reason why this, uh, our administration, uh, in America right now is getting so bad and almost, like, publicly getting bad to the point where it's so obvious that it's almost like
[01:03:41.397 --> 01:03:42.158]  I totally agree.
[01:03:42.198 --> 01:03:42.618]  Stay there.
[01:03:42.698 --> 01:03:44.020]  Let's put him on hold.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:48.884]  He'll be with us when we start the next hour with the Deep Behind Enemy Lines intro.
[01:03:57.512 --> 01:04:00.033]  We'll be back in two minutes after the show ends.
[01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:07.776]  We're going to stream some video to the video viewers at PrisonPlanet.tv, but we'll be back for everybody in just two minutes.
[01:04:08.276 --> 01:04:15.099]  It'll give everybody time to tune over to InfoWars.com to the main streams right there with George Humphrey, my guest in studio.
[01:04:15.139 --> 01:04:17.060]  By the way, he is an author and documentary filmmaker.
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.321]  I will tell you about
[01:04:19.341 --> 01:04:20.701]  Well, it's not even his website.
[01:04:20.741 --> 01:04:21.862]  I gave it to somebody else to run.
[01:04:22.342 --> 01:04:22.942]  A great lady.
[01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:27.504]  It's fearorlove.com, but you can also get them all at infowars.com.
[01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:32.325]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with hour number four of Overdrive.
[01:04:32.605 --> 01:04:33.566]  Stay with us.
[01:04:37.067 --> 01:04:40.608]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:04:40.908 --> 01:04:41.528]  Good job, Jones.
[01:04:42.709 --> 01:04:43.649]  Yeah, I really appreciate you.
[01:04:43.669 --> 01:04:44.289]  I'll see you tomorrow.
[01:04:44.629 --> 01:04:45.410]  Yep, we'll see you tomorrow.
[01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.870]  Thanks, bye.
[01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:46.230]  Good show.
[01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:56.452]  A world in which there is a very real prospect of a new world order.
[01:05:26.806 --> 01:05:31.469]  The question is, will they kill untold millions as they did in the last century?
[01:05:44.136 --> 01:05:47.118]  It is not the elite cockroaches that determine that.
[01:06:50.103 --> 01:06:55.088]  Hello folks, thank you for joining us into the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[01:06:55.108 --> 01:06:58.812]  George Humphrey is my guest, fairerlove.com.
[01:06:59.593 --> 01:07:02.596]  He is a documentary filmmaker and multi-time author.
[01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:07.861]  Tens of thousands, I would guess 100,000 plus probably, books out there.
[01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:10.985]  How many of your books are out there, George?
[01:07:11.645 --> 01:07:11.825]  About 160,000.
[01:07:13.939 --> 01:07:15.220]  Wow, that is really exciting.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.381]  We're going to go ahead and go right back to the last caller we were talking to, Sam in Florida.
[01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:22.082]  Restate the point you were making, expand on it.
[01:07:22.382 --> 01:07:28.024]  It's a key area and I want to get George's take on more of the subtleties of the New World Order.
[01:07:28.825 --> 01:07:37.108]  Yeah, pretty much what I was saying was, because what I'm starting to see is, I've been going on the Council on Foreign Relations sites, I've been listening to the World Federalists and going around.
[01:07:37.128 --> 01:07:42.690]  They're pretty much saying that they want a more functional United Nations, a more functional World Criminal Court.
[01:07:43.925 --> 01:07:49.648]  And what I'm seeing is there's a lot of resentment towards our administration, even coming from the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:55.572]  So it's almost like they're setting it up to make us look bad anyway, even though they're controlling them.
[01:07:55.592 --> 01:08:03.696]  And then at some point they're going to come in as an example and go, hey, we need to cede sovereignty from a superpower, even of America.
[01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:11.500]  Well, I couldn't say it any better and thank you for the call, Sam.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.182]  First, let's get George Humphrey's take on what you were just saying.
[01:08:16.289 --> 01:08:34.593]  And I think what you very first said before the commercial was, is that the level of evilness, the level of corruption, the level of just absolute blatant arrogance is just getting more and more and more bizarre day by day.
[01:08:35.034 --> 01:08:44.836]  Stuff that we're seeing on the television today, even five or six years ago, it would have been headlines, and now it's just, oh hum, they're doing it again, oh hum, what's next?
[01:08:46.482 --> 01:08:49.989]  There's no doubt, George, there's a formula here with a behavioral psychologist.
[01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:58.645]  I mean, they on purpose, they didn't make them secret, put out John Yoo and Alberto Gonzalez's memos saying we torture children with pliers on their testicles.
[01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:10.267]  Because if they can get you to accept that, totally wild, depraved, you know, something out of the movie Hostile or Saw, or Jeffrey Dahmer, Silence of the Lambs, then they've got you.
[01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:11.727]  Absolutely.
[01:09:11.867 --> 01:09:23.895]  And you and I have been talking about this analogy for 15 years, the analogy of the frog getting put in a pot and bringing up the water slowly to boil the frog.
[01:09:24.675 --> 01:09:30.760]  And they've been bringing up the heat for years and years and years, and the water's boiling right now, friends.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.282]  The water's boiling.
[01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:41.329]  We are in an absolutely terrible, terrifying situation from a third-dimensional point of view.
[01:09:42.089 --> 01:09:52.956]  But from another point of view, the pressure has gotten so incredible that at least more and more people are starting to wake up.
[01:09:52.996 --> 01:09:54.357]  They're listening to Alex.
[01:09:54.397 --> 01:09:55.337]  They're listening to me.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.244]  Five years ago I would have just guffawed and laughed and gotten angry about the things I say.
[01:10:05.684 --> 01:10:15.951]  Now they're coming up to me every single day in the coffee shops, in the restaurants, calling me on the phone and sharing this information and going, what the heck is going on?
[01:10:16.432 --> 01:10:22.676]  And so there is an awakening, there is a shift taking place, but the question is, is what's going to happen?
[01:10:22.976 --> 01:10:29.061]  Is the terror going to accelerate or are the people of this country going to wake up and demand
[01:10:32.503 --> 01:10:45.072]  Well, just elaborating on what the caller was bringing up, Sam in Florida, before we go to others here and then talk about solutions, both economically and as you were saying with your consciousness, which I agree is a big part of the solution, the key to it all.
[01:10:46.445 --> 01:10:53.988]  The globalists are masters at being puppeteers, having fronts, having layers of veils that are in front of them.
[01:10:54.849 --> 01:10:59.611]  And so, just like they'll use a Bush for eight years, or a Bill Clinton for eight years, or a George Sr.
[01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:00.832]  for four, or a Reagan for eight,
[01:11:02.192 --> 01:11:08.215]  Uh, these guys literally, it always turns out, they are the wise men behind them who then represent Rockefeller, Rothschild.
[01:11:08.275 --> 01:11:12.638]  I mean, it's always... I mean, you notice, going back to Nixon, it's always Kissinger.
[01:11:13.038 --> 01:11:13.558]  Right.
[01:11:13.738 --> 01:11:14.919]  And, you know, McNamara.
[01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:18.961]  And this handful... and Zbigniew Brzezinski is in...
[01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:21.183]  Well, he's right behind Brock right now.
[01:11:21.323 --> 01:11:22.224]  Exactly.
[01:11:22.604 --> 01:11:31.992]  And then they always come from a certain PhD, school from Harvard, or Chicago business, or both, and it's always the same worldview, the same Machiavellian system.
[01:11:32.012 --> 01:11:36.015]  And I know the listeners understand this, that it's like a tag team wrestling.
[01:11:36.355 --> 01:11:41.339]  They go for four years with one candidate, you wake up to them, then eight years with this, and four with that, and then eight, eight.
[01:11:41.359 --> 01:11:42.440]  That's how they're tricking you.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.042]  But it's the same thing with
[01:11:45.257 --> 01:11:47.179]  The globalists are bigger than any one nation.
[01:11:47.199 --> 01:12:07.814]  They're always destroying national sovereignty, moving their capital and real funds into raw materials, commodities, militaries, and always trying to get global standards set, lobbying to have the same standards set, the same card readers, the same face scanners, the same, you know, metric scales, where they're the map makers, they're the great architects, is what they call themselves.
[01:12:08.134 --> 01:12:08.574]  And so, yes,
[01:12:09.935 --> 01:12:20.001]  They used Hitler as their mad dog to go tear up old Europe and get rid of some of the old European power structures in France and Germany and Belgium and Luxembourg and other places.
[01:12:20.861 --> 01:12:22.662]  They also did the same thing with the Soviets.
[01:12:22.742 --> 01:12:24.563]  That was all financed by the big banks.
[01:12:24.803 --> 01:12:25.864]  That's now been declassified.
[01:12:25.884 --> 01:12:32.848]  They put Mao in, as David Rockefeller said in the New York Times, as a unifying, quote, good effect.
[01:12:32.908 --> 01:12:34.309]  Killing 60 million is a good thing.
[01:12:34.849 --> 01:12:35.810]  He said that in his own book.
[01:12:36.773 --> 01:12:38.214]  So, it's the same thing.
[01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:38.794]  The U.S.
[01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.575]  is now the Hitler or the Stalin.
[01:12:40.915 --> 01:12:43.896]  We're being used as the... Worldwide we're the bad guy.
[01:12:43.916 --> 01:12:52.080]  They're the same... Rupert Murdoch, in Australian, British, European papers, and he owns papers in every major language, you know, throughout the Western world.
[01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:57.563]  Rupert Murdoch bad mouths America six, seven years ago and had inside job headlines.
[01:12:58.325 --> 01:12:59.346]  But instead, America did it.
[01:12:59.646 --> 01:13:00.127]  The U.S.
[01:13:00.147 --> 01:13:00.347]  did it.
[01:13:00.827 --> 01:13:05.632]  But then domestically, he puts out propaganda, everybody loves the war, we're doing great, we're fighting Al Qaeda.
[01:13:05.832 --> 01:13:07.734]  Meanwhile, he funds Hillary and he funds Bush.
[01:13:08.254 --> 01:13:15.561]  You see, that's an example of what you're saying is true, that America has to fall, and so we're being set up for that fall.
[01:13:15.581 --> 01:13:18.364]  We're being blamed for the subprime, when all these countries have them.
[01:13:18.604 --> 01:13:20.486]  We're being blamed, I have headlines today.
[01:13:21.387 --> 01:13:22.948]  George, I want you to
[01:13:23.889 --> 01:13:25.190]  Elaborate on this paradigm.
[01:13:53.869 --> 01:14:00.674]  I want to make clear, you are a decreed economist, and more than just being a decreed economist, you are also a very successful businessman.
[01:14:00.934 --> 01:14:02.795]  Well, that's what I've done, yeah.
[01:14:02.816 --> 01:14:06.178]  I mean, there's a lot of economists who couldn't run a lemonade stand.
[01:14:06.218 --> 01:14:07.079]  My point is, you've done both.
[01:14:07.119 --> 01:14:07.359]  Go ahead.
[01:14:07.379 --> 01:14:17.346]  Yeah, and the point is, is that this economy, and I can't guarantee everything I'm going to say is true, because this thing is so huge, and there's so many moving parts.
[01:14:17.766 --> 01:14:21.708]  But when you look at the fundamentals, there are six things that we have to look at.
[01:14:21.828 --> 01:14:23.749]  First of all is the national debt.
[01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:40.458]  The national debt, when you include the operating fund, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and off-budget, according to the Director of the General Accounting Office, this is not some theory, is that our national debt right now is $53 trillion.
[01:14:40.478 --> 01:14:42.740]  $53 trillion, not the $9.7 trillion that they talk about.
[01:14:47.342 --> 01:14:54.091]  That is $173,000 for every person in this country.
[01:14:54.671 --> 01:14:58.997]  Children, toddlers, retired, prisoners, every single person.
[01:14:59.357 --> 01:15:05.966]  Now this does not include state, local, corporate, or personal debt.
[01:15:06.849 --> 01:15:16.297]  And when you put local and corporate and personal debt in, those numbers, that's another $45 to $55 trillion.
[01:15:16.617 --> 01:15:30.328]  So what we're talking about is debt in this country of over $340,000 per person and with a gross domestic product of $13.7 trillion.
[01:15:30.368 --> 01:15:34.652]  Now I know after a while these numbers just get way out there, but the point is that
[01:15:36.869 --> 01:15:39.090]  If you're going to dance, you've got to pay the fiddler.
[01:15:39.651 --> 01:15:42.432]  You know, if you're going to run a business, you've got to pay your bills.
[01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:44.794]  If you own a house, you've got to pay your mortgage.
[01:15:45.294 --> 01:15:49.257]  And there is no way in the world that this country can do that.
[01:15:49.317 --> 01:15:50.557]  So number one is the debt.
[01:15:50.978 --> 01:15:55.721]  Number two, what's coming at us like a tsunami, is the switch.
[01:15:55.901 --> 01:16:04.966]  Since 1945, all the world's commodities, oil, gas, corn, food, everything, has been based upon U.S.
[01:16:05.066 --> 01:16:05.487]  dollars.
[01:16:06.857 --> 01:16:17.845]  Now, as we all know, just like a junkie will do anything for its junk, the United States will do anything for its oil and for its money.
[01:16:18.085 --> 01:16:21.407]  And when Saddam went from being in U.S.
[01:16:21.487 --> 01:16:24.930]  dollars to going to Euros, within weeks we attacked him.
[01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:31.232]  Now, it's very, very clear that Iran is setting up the Borshaw on the island off of Iran.
[01:16:31.272 --> 01:16:33.132]  They're going to be taking Euros.
[01:16:33.573 --> 01:16:40.415]  It's very, very clear that both China and Russia are talking about taking alternative currencies.
[01:16:40.575 --> 01:16:42.335]  Venezuela is looking at doing this.
[01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:49.778]  And if and when these countries go from the American dollar to alternative currencies.
[01:16:50.698 --> 01:16:52.479]  It's Katie Bar-The-Door.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:54.801]  Number three is the trade deficit.
[01:16:55.501 --> 01:16:56.382]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:16:56.802 --> 01:16:57.343]  Let's go back.
[01:16:58.183 --> 01:17:10.591]  I had a caller call in like two hours ago, and he said, how is it that they're letting the dollar slip, but then they're also dumping gold in the market out of the IMF and other holdings to drive down the price of gold?
[01:17:11.072 --> 01:17:15.034]  And he said that if they drive the price of gold down, the dollar will go back up in value.
[01:17:16.435 --> 01:17:30.349]  That the real laws of true free market are not in play here, and then from all the evidence I see, they want, and even the Times of London, Financial Times has said this, they want a slow slide of the dollar, they don't want a quick slide.
[01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:34.072]  So what's the globalist real policy, or are there fissures?
[01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:41.958]  Well, of course there's fissures, because there's human beings within their group of people, and there's competition within their group.
[01:17:41.978 --> 01:17:42.359]  Jocking!
[01:17:42.679 --> 01:17:53.572]  There's jocking, and just like the neocons represent one arm of the Illuminati, as opposed to the more traditional Rothschild group, is that there is jocking.
[01:17:54.933 --> 01:18:12.646]  I believe that the reason the price of gold and silver is artificially low right now is not so much because the IMF is dumping gold and silver out there, it's because the Plunge Protection Team and G7 are creating out of thin air... $400 million a month!
[01:18:13.666 --> 01:18:16.167]  Is what they're doing is that they're buying shorts.
[01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:19.008]  And all you have to do is take a look.
[01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:19.988]  Well, we know they're doing that, too.
[01:18:20.188 --> 01:18:26.370]  Yeah, and the shorting is what is the real way that they're keeping down price.
[01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:29.271]  Sure, but explain that, but then why do the globalists want a weak dollar?
[01:18:30.495 --> 01:18:45.506]  Well, quite clearly, because the American economy, the American culture, the American republic is the last bastion of strength to resist the new world, the globalization, the atheistic, you know, just this Borg mentality.
[01:18:45.786 --> 01:18:50.990]  There are still people like us out there who believe in a republic and believe in sovereignty.
[01:18:51.870 --> 01:19:03.781]  And because the dollar has been, it's been strong as a dollar for, you know, last hundred years, is that the first way you destroy any country is by destroying their economy.
[01:19:04.442 --> 01:19:06.664]  And the number one target is their currency.
[01:19:06.964 --> 01:19:07.564]  Absolutely.
[01:19:07.624 --> 01:19:17.854]  And with the fiat currencies as we have right now, and with the fact that a vast, vast majority of the people of this country have no concept
[01:19:18.514 --> 01:19:28.501]  Including very educated people about the Federal Reserve, or about fiat currency, or about the Plunge Protection Team, or about all the massive manipulation that's going on.
[01:19:29.402 --> 01:19:40.469]  And just as the movie The Matrix was about this illusionary reality, the reality of our free market system is almost in alignment with The Matrix.
[01:19:40.769 --> 01:19:42.570]  I call it a simulation of free market.
[01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:57.854]  It's only free market at the low level where we act, but in the true economy, it's all about destroying the free market and creating a monopolistic oligopoly, or interlocking cartels with artificial scarcity.
[01:19:58.034 --> 01:20:06.356]  It's absolutely, and when you look at this, and you don't, this is not conspiracy theory, it's just conspiracy fact.
[01:20:06.816 --> 01:20:21.293]  And when you look at this very objectively and very honestly, one understands that there is a tremendous transfer of power from the middle and upper middle incomes to the ultra, ultra, ultra elite.
[01:20:21.953 --> 01:20:30.636]  And it is a mathematical formula that was put out by the Rothschilds back in the late 1700s and has been refined for the last 150 years.
[01:20:31.017 --> 01:20:42.381]  Now one of the things, and the third thing that they're doing is that just as if you have a business, if you have a hot dog stand, if you don't sell more hot dogs and you take in money, you're going to go broke.
[01:20:43.301 --> 01:20:50.847]  And the United States, for a hundred years, had the largest trade surplus of any nation in the world.
[01:20:51.407 --> 01:20:55.651]  What made America strong was our manufacturing base.
[01:20:56.091 --> 01:21:06.679]  I can't say this strong enough or with enough clarity, is that 40 years ago, manufacturing represented 43% of our gross domestic product.
[01:21:10.154 --> 01:21:23.707]  Families, man could work, the woman could stay home, they could have their kids have a good education, they could go on trips, they could have good medical care, and they could save money.
[01:21:24.428 --> 01:21:27.311]  Now, both the man and the women are working.
[01:21:27.691 --> 01:21:29.753]  They're getting deeper and deeper in debt.
[01:21:29.793 --> 01:21:34.278]  Starting about six years ago, the average families had more debt than they had assets.
[01:21:35.038 --> 01:21:41.541]  And now, instead of 43% of our economy being manufacturing because of NAFTA, it's 14%.
[01:21:41.661 --> 01:21:48.304]  Friends, we are quickly being moved toward a second world nation.
[01:21:49.124 --> 01:21:55.707]  If you don't make things, if you don't sell things, if you're not productive, you're going to be a slave.
[01:21:56.127 --> 01:22:00.269]  And the amazing thing is, is that the two sectors that have increased
[01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:05.308]  Exponentially, are the service industry and government.
[01:22:05.668 --> 01:22:12.836]  And by definition, clearly, clearly, clearly, neither service nor government creates any real wealth.
[01:22:13.297 --> 01:22:16.360]  And they're simultaneously contracting right now.
[01:22:16.621 --> 01:22:18.663]  Simultaneously, we see these areas contracting.
[01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:20.084]  Yeah, it's just amazing.
[01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:26.849]  This year alone, our trade deficit is going to be over $550 billion, which is 4% of our gross domestic product.
[01:22:26.869 --> 01:22:28.190]  This is just amazing.
[01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:31.713]  And on MSNBC and FOX, they're saying this is a good thing.
[01:22:32.093 --> 01:22:35.015]  It is just absolutely the biggest oxymoron.
[01:22:35.396 --> 01:22:39.799]  Then we go into our bonds, our mortgages, and subprime loans.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:48.186]  I mean, just one shoe falls, and another shoe falls, and anybody... We've got all the credit cards coming, too.
[01:22:48.766 --> 01:22:51.128]  Everybody's leveraged in those.
[01:22:51.509 --> 01:22:52.209]  It is amazing.
[01:22:52.249 --> 01:22:54.511]  And then, meanwhile, it doesn't matter if they've cut interest rates.
[01:22:54.832 --> 01:22:58.294]  You know, Downward Bank's giving you about 1.5% of your lucky now in your money.
[01:23:00.616 --> 01:23:03.399]  They're still not giving liquidity to people that want mortgages.
[01:23:03.999 --> 01:23:06.982]  So what's happening is, they're punishing people that do save.
[01:23:07.222 --> 01:23:13.687]  Yeah, and basically right now they've cut the interest rates so much that we're at what's called the Japan Syndrome.
[01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:19.452]  No matter how much they use what's called monetary policy, it's not going to stimulate it.
[01:23:19.532 --> 01:23:31.962]  Why did Paul Volcker come out and say we should go to 15 percentage point interest rates and cut spending, and then I've talked to other economists here on air, they agree and say that even though he's New World Order, that's the only thing that would make the dollar come back.
[01:23:32.042 --> 01:23:34.125]  Well, he's a tough old German, you know?
[01:23:34.585 --> 01:23:42.155]  And as much as he is part of the New World Order, is that he has a traditional point of view about the economy.
[01:23:42.715 --> 01:23:46.480]  And remember back in 79 through 81, the interest rates went from 5.5% up to 21%.
[01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:55.708]  And I'll tell you what, they took care of inflation and they kept the economy pretty dad-gum solid for about six or seven years after that.
[01:23:57.109 --> 01:24:07.496]  But then in the early 90s they decided to take the restrictions off the banks and allow them to merge into brokerage firms, merge into giving other types of non-traditional loans.
[01:24:07.736 --> 01:24:09.557]  We saw the three types of banking all merge.
[01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:10.118]  Can you explain that?
[01:24:14.733 --> 01:24:31.529]  I think you explained it very well, is that the people running this government have been getting huge, huge, huge campaign contributions from the financial organizations, and where we once had a very, very clear delineation of lines,
[01:24:32.611 --> 01:24:32.931]  Yes, we are.
[01:24:47.814 --> 01:24:56.400]  And they were, for the last eight or nine years, they were giving loans on houses to people who were making $60,000, $70,000 a year.
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:02.984]  They were buying houses that were $700,000 and giving them a subprime loan on top of that.
[01:25:03.024 --> 01:25:06.586]  So they were only paying interest only at 2%, you know, interest only for 2%.
[01:25:06.626 --> 01:25:07.387]  Knowing what was going to happen.
[01:25:09.428 --> 01:25:10.469]  I always knew this was the case.
[01:25:10.489 --> 01:25:12.751]  I'd read about it in some industry publications, but I experienced it.
[01:25:12.991 --> 01:25:21.017]  When I was in college, living in a one-room efficiency, literally a bathroom, a bedroom, and a kitchen, I remember getting credit cards almost every day in the mail.
[01:25:21.037 --> 01:25:23.239]  I mean, four or five times a week at 20% interest.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:27.563]  As soon as I got out of debt, and I'm not a big spender, so I'm not in debt.
[01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:33.807]  I suddenly started not getting them, but like once a month or once every two months or three months in the mail.
[01:25:34.307 --> 01:25:36.289]  I was listening to Clark Howard, that financial show.
[01:25:36.669 --> 01:25:40.051]  Now he's mainly the retail stuff, low level, you know, good ideas.
[01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:41.553]  He never tells you about the big corrupt system.
[01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:45.816]  But he did get on air, I was driving about two weeks ago and he admitted he read this big
[01:25:46.687 --> 01:25:47.488]  Consumer Report
[01:26:06.090 --> 01:26:12.797]  And how they do target the young people to get them in debt, because it's all fiat, and that they don't target people that actually have some money.
[01:26:13.518 --> 01:26:18.663]  And so, a lot of people say, you know, the neocon talk is, well, these poor people shouldn't have got these loans, they deserve it.
[01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:28.352]  The point is, you had the banks, you had the appraisers, you had the realtors, they all lied, showing the mass corruption in a society to go along with this, and so,
[01:26:29.373 --> 01:26:31.414]  I use the analogy of a child being kidnapped.
[01:26:31.434 --> 01:26:32.154]  Yeah, they're bad.
[01:26:32.214 --> 01:26:33.655]  They didn't listen to mommy and daddy.
[01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.155]  They went for the car to get candy.
[01:26:35.675 --> 01:26:38.677]  But the child still isn't really bad compared to the actual kidnapper.
[01:26:38.877 --> 01:26:39.757]  You see what I'm saying, George?
[01:26:39.797 --> 01:26:40.377]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:26:40.397 --> 01:26:41.758]  You're absolutely right on target.
[01:26:41.858 --> 01:26:50.161]  And then, to make matters worse, is that AMBAC and the companies that rate the municipal bonds
[01:26:51.061 --> 01:27:01.572]  That are the basis of the supposedly integrity of this country, took all of these mortgages and wrapped them together in bundles called tranches.
[01:27:02.433 --> 01:27:05.637]  And then they sold them as AAA bots.
[01:27:05.997 --> 01:27:07.098]  It's amazing!
[01:27:07.158 --> 01:27:12.224]  And then in a lot of cases, companies affiliated with them and part owned by them would be the certification insurers.
[01:27:12.264 --> 01:27:23.011]  Yeah, and again, we can trace the people who are putting this together with campaign contributions to the politicians who have taken off the restrictions.
[01:27:23.352 --> 01:27:30.857]  And so now these tranches are coming due, the interest rates are going from 2 to 6 percent, the value of the homes is going down.
[01:27:31.477 --> 01:27:46.162]  And millions and millions of people are walking away from their loans and these AAA bonds that were bought in good faith are selling at between 40 to 70 percent of their face value and now this is what is just amazing.
[01:27:46.582 --> 01:27:58.091]  Three weeks ago the United States government through the Treasury and Federal Reserve and Plunge Protection Team came in and bought four hundred billion dollars of these tranches at face value.
[01:27:58.652 --> 01:28:05.157]  That means every single one of you that has any money in the bank, the value of your money has just gone down two or three percent.
[01:28:05.397 --> 01:28:09.881]  Just because they were bailing out their buddies who had the companies.
[01:28:09.901 --> 01:28:12.143]  They weren't bailing out the people who had the loans.
[01:28:12.163 --> 01:28:12.984]  But it's not just that!
[01:28:13.744 --> 01:28:29.519]  We not only is it devaluing our savings and investments in stocks and bonds by devaluing the dollar, it is also, we are going to have to pay for that through taxes, and they're already talking about current obligations, just what we owe today, what's due today.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.223]  This is in the newspapers, I'm sure it's much higher.
[01:28:34.623 --> 01:28:35.324]  $84,000 per person.
[01:28:35.724 --> 01:28:39.607]  The war, though, that's not counting the war, the war there sinks $35,000.
[01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:42.208]  That was a few months ago, that was in the mainstream news, I'm sure it's much worse.
[01:28:42.869 --> 01:28:44.710]  So we're talking about a hundred and something thou there.
[01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:48.513]  And then if you talk about real obligations, it's tens of millions apiece.
[01:28:48.833 --> 01:28:50.594]  There's no way to ever pay this off.
[01:28:50.874 --> 01:28:54.057]  This was a black hole designed to suck us in.
[01:28:54.137 --> 01:28:57.319]  It's mathematically impossible to pay off this debt right now.
[01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:00.880]  I mean, this is just straight mathematics.
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.940]  Look in the camera and tell folks, explain to them.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:18.963]  Well, it all started back in May 1st, 1776, when two very, very enterprising young people, a guy called Rothschild and a guy called Weisshoff, got together.
[01:29:19.003 --> 01:29:20.884]  And boy, were they smart!
[01:29:21.144 --> 01:29:24.204]  Weisshoff was the political guy, Rothschild was the money guy.
[01:29:24.624 --> 01:29:27.145]  And they figured out fractional reserve banking.
[01:29:27.805 --> 01:29:35.813]  Now, they just give a little bit here, and they give a little bit there, and everybody's happy at the start, and then everybody gets a little happier, but they're just eaten away.
[01:29:36.153 --> 01:29:40.037]  They're the little termites, and they create what's called fiat currency.
[01:29:40.517 --> 01:29:43.300]  Now, fiat currency is the devil.
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:46.222]  It is the stuff that they talk about in the Old Testament.
[01:29:46.282 --> 01:29:48.825]  It's the stuff they talk about in the New Testament.
[01:29:49.445 --> 01:29:49.725]  I think so.
[01:30:05.591 --> 01:30:16.339]  All talk very, very specifically about not having usury, about having a financial system that was based upon a public currency with hard assets.
[01:30:16.479 --> 01:30:23.885]  A dollar is defined in the Constitution as so many grams of silver or so many grams of gold.
[01:30:23.925 --> 01:30:25.246]  It is not a piece of paper.
[01:30:25.666 --> 01:30:26.787]  It is a value.
[01:30:26.947 --> 01:30:28.188]  It is a value to keep
[01:30:30.894 --> 01:30:34.076]  To keep your life and my life a better life.
[01:30:34.157 --> 01:30:39.561]  And from 1792 through 1913, when this country had huge expansion.
[01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.262]  15% growth rate some years.
[01:30:41.422 --> 01:30:42.383]  On average about 10.
[01:30:42.463 --> 01:30:47.066]  There was only a 76% inflation during that period of time.
[01:30:47.146 --> 01:30:52.810]  Since 1913, in the introduction of the Federal Reserve Banking Act, we've had 22-2500% inflation.
[01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:54.332]  And most of that has happened since 1980.
[01:30:57.554 --> 01:30:58.475]  And people don't see this.
[01:30:58.515 --> 01:31:08.442]  Not only are they losing their jobs, that's why, even though they've gotten some raises, that's why over a decade they aren't as well off as they were, because that inflation is destroying everything.
[01:31:08.622 --> 01:31:08.882]  Yeah.
[01:31:09.983 --> 01:31:11.684]  A dollar today
[01:31:13.365 --> 01:31:14.686]  Two cents in 1913.
[01:31:15.286 --> 01:31:19.288]  Two cents in 1913 is equivalent to a dollar today.
[01:31:19.688 --> 01:31:22.009]  That is how absolutely insane that is.
[01:31:22.409 --> 01:31:35.574]  And when you have all this economic turbulence going on, and everybody's worried about it, and then you have these folks that are on the inside, they're taking their cut, taking their cut, taking their cut.
[01:31:35.874 --> 01:31:36.994]  They're stealing from you.
[01:31:37.074 --> 01:31:41.416]  And then they take the fiat and they put it in commodities, roads, infrastructure.
[01:31:41.716 --> 01:31:41.936]  Yeah.
[01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:45.200]  They've been greedily doing that for a decade, while getting us ready for the fall.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:46.461]  And it's just like Joe Kennedy.
[01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.505]  They make money going up, and they make money going down.
[01:31:49.525 --> 01:31:51.407]  1926, Joe Kennedy was worth $375,000.
[01:31:51.467 --> 01:31:53.910]  By 1935, he was worth $37 million.
[01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:59.896]  And that brings us to the next point, and I want to go to calls for the rest of the show and talk about solutions.
[01:32:00.337 --> 01:32:02.459]  What would you as an economist, successful businessman,
[01:32:03.180 --> 01:32:14.787]  What would you do for somebody who, let's say, has got $100,000 in the bank, a $200,000 house, two kids, and the man and woman are both making $50,000 a year, versus somebody who's got, say, $5,000,000.
[01:32:14.927 --> 01:32:21.932]  Yeah, we've got to talk about real-life scenarios, and the first thing, number one, is that you get out of debt.
[01:32:22.052 --> 01:32:23.413]  Debt is a virus.
[01:32:23.773 --> 01:32:26.735]  It's as bad a virus as AIDS or a flu or whatever.
[01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:31.538]  Stay out of debt right now, because it will come back and chew you up.
[01:32:32.288 --> 01:32:36.071]  Number two is get work that you appreciate, that you like.
[01:32:36.491 --> 01:32:52.142]  Number three is that I believe that you need to put between 7 to 15 to 20 percent of your total assets into hard commodities, whether that be gold or silver or platinum or copper.
[01:32:53.563 --> 01:32:55.566]  Most people are talking about gold and silver.
[01:32:55.606 --> 01:32:59.770]  Now, clearly gold and silver have had huge run-ups in the last three years.
[01:33:00.631 --> 01:33:05.096]  Five years ago, gold was $450 an ounce, and it's $9.30 this morning.
[01:33:05.136 --> 01:33:07.139]  Silver was less than $4.20 an ounce, and it's $17.80 this morning.
[01:33:13.926 --> 01:33:18.328]  And so a lot of people are saying the run-up is at its peak.
[01:33:18.388 --> 01:33:31.594]  But the point is, as long as the value of the dollar is going down, real commodities such as oil and gas and copper and wheat and corn and oil and gas
[01:33:32.094 --> 01:33:35.975]  Things that people need and use are going to continue to go up.
[01:33:36.295 --> 01:33:49.740]  All you have to do is look at what OPEC had to say the other day, and they said the reason the price of oil is $112 a barrel is not because we're raising prices, it's because you dadgum stupid Americans are devaluating the dollar.
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:54.942]  I know, and then about a month ago, I played the clip on air, here on the Genesis Network,
[01:33:56.722 --> 01:34:00.145]  They were in a press conference and the press kept asking, is the dollar being devalued?
[01:34:00.165 --> 01:34:01.146]  Can the president tell us?
[01:34:01.527 --> 01:34:06.011]  And she said, I'll be fired as if the press needs to ask the president if oil's up because of the dollar.
[01:34:12.316 --> 01:34:15.679]  I mean, this is like saying, we need to ask the government if the sky is blue.
[01:34:15.899 --> 01:34:18.421]  And they always are pointing someplace else.
[01:34:18.441 --> 01:34:20.902]  They're always saying, well, go and ask the Treasury.
[01:34:20.943 --> 01:34:23.665]  Well, go and ask the Fed.
[01:34:23.945 --> 01:34:31.090]  And I saw Paul talking to Bernanke the other day, and Bernanke, who is head of the Fed, is saying, well, you've got to go and ask the Treasury.
[01:34:33.952 --> 01:34:40.894]  Volker, as much as I dislike the son of a gun, at least he'd look you in the face and he wouldn't avoid the question.
[01:34:40.934 --> 01:34:44.416]  He'd tell you to go, you know... Yeah, but they removed Volker and put Greenspan in.
[01:34:44.476 --> 01:34:49.317]  Yeah, well, Greenspan was one of the brightest guys in the world.
[01:34:49.377 --> 01:34:50.097]  He was one of us!
[01:34:50.298 --> 01:34:50.778]  He was.
[01:34:50.798 --> 01:34:52.098]  And he literally turned to the dark side.
[01:34:54.599 --> 01:34:56.041]  Well done, Lord Greenspan!
[01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:57.002]  You have done well!
[01:34:57.182 --> 01:34:58.244]  You have done well, Lord Greenspan!
[01:34:58.284 --> 01:34:59.706]  Well done, Lord Greenspan!
[01:34:59.726 --> 01:35:01.148]  Do what must be done, Lord Greenspan!
[01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:15.786]  And he was responding, you know, clearly Greenspan was responsible for this last bubble.
[01:35:15.846 --> 01:35:18.889]  There's two bubbles that we've had in the last 10 years.
[01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:21.752]  Okay, here's the $64 million quote.
[01:35:22.052 --> 01:35:25.736]  That's the real estate bubble and the stock bubble.
[01:35:25.756 --> 01:35:29.920]  The real estate bubble is quickly, quickly deflating right now.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:31.221]  And it's gone global.
[01:35:31.501 --> 01:35:38.267]  Remember, three years ago from Bilderberg, we said, Bilderberg is saying they're going to artificially pop it to start the consolidation.
[01:35:38.367 --> 01:35:38.908]  We're on record.
[01:35:39.408 --> 01:35:46.775]  In fact, the footage I shot two years ago is in Endgame, where we had Daniel Esselstyn saying, here's the info, I got this from the mole.
[01:35:48.136 --> 01:35:50.298]  So, I mean, they really are running things.
[01:35:50.538 --> 01:35:56.805]  Oh absolutely, and as I was saying before, they can make money going up, or they can make money going down.
[01:35:56.865 --> 01:35:59.188]  Joe Kennedy was worth $375,000 in 1926, and he was worth $37 million in 1935.
[01:35:59.228 --> 01:35:59.929]  Now here's my next question.
[01:36:05.535 --> 01:36:26.025]  As an economist and successful businessman watching all this happen, most economists I've talked to, and brokers and experts, they say two to three years, the Shadowstats guy, the head professor at the Newark School of Business, Sticklitz, Bob Chapman, smart guy, they're all saying two to three years, hyperinflationary depression, guaranteed.
[01:36:26.405 --> 01:36:28.226]  Now, A, is it guaranteed?
[01:36:28.326 --> 01:36:30.327]  And B, if it is, what's the time frame?
[01:36:30.387 --> 01:36:34.991]  Well, I would never say anything's guaranteed, because I've been looking at this stuff for way, way, way too long.
[01:36:35.011 --> 01:36:36.852]  And they may just pump the bubble up even bigger.
[01:36:36.992 --> 01:36:44.718]  In my crystal ball, I think I know what's going on, and if you looked at fundamentals, the market should have consolidated years and years and years.
[01:36:44.738 --> 01:36:45.379]  Ten years ago?
[01:36:45.459 --> 01:36:46.379]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:46.519 --> 01:36:49.562]  I mean, it was already impossible numbers of debt ten years ago.
[01:36:49.782 --> 01:36:54.666]  But, you know, what we have to realize is that the market is an illusion.
[01:36:55.286 --> 01:36:56.547]  The people behind the market.
[01:36:56.647 --> 01:37:00.210]  Basically, Bernanke has taken the step of monetizing the debt.
[01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:01.451]  Nationalizing it.
[01:37:02.071 --> 01:37:03.192]  Monetizing it.
[01:37:03.212 --> 01:37:04.013]  Let's be clear though.
[01:37:04.293 --> 01:37:07.115]  The Fed engineered the crisis as a member bank.
[01:37:07.416 --> 01:37:08.516]  They're all part of the same family.
[01:37:08.997 --> 01:37:15.342]  And now they're going to come in as the savior and take over the three federal regulatory agencies and now actually have government power.
[01:37:16.451 --> 01:37:17.592]  Yeah, and no one watching them.
[01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:26.778]  And except for a handful of people, they don't even, they say, well, we're going to just make these small little changes.
[01:37:26.918 --> 01:37:30.220]  What we're talking about is... Explain what monetizing means.
[01:37:30.401 --> 01:37:33.242]  Well, they've become the bank of last resort.
[01:37:33.663 --> 01:37:36.885]  I mean, they've nationalized, I mean, as you said... They're saying we're going to inflate.
[01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:38.126]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:38.206 --> 01:37:42.832]  And quite clearly, Bernanke has called Helicopter Ben for a good reason.
[01:37:43.152 --> 01:37:51.822]  He said that instead of letting the economy correct naturally, he would get in a helicopter and shovel out $100 bills over the Walmarts.
[01:37:52.162 --> 01:37:59.964]  And he has said, as the trade deficit gets bigger, he has said that we, quote, have 2% inflation last year.
[01:38:00.004 --> 01:38:01.165]  Now he says it's 6% when it's really 15%.
[01:38:01.725 --> 01:38:13.008]  But when you take out energy, when you take out transportation, when you take out real estate, and you just take that out of the CPI, it's just like, come on guys.
[01:38:13.048 --> 01:38:14.269]  But there's still massive inflation.
[01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:14.949]  Of course there is.
[01:38:14.969 --> 01:38:18.150]  Listen, I bought $7 a gallon milk a month ago.
[01:38:19.568 --> 01:38:26.170]  Now, it was at a gas station where they double it, but the point is that, you know, I was out in the country, had to buy a gallon of milk, and it was seven and a half dollars.
[01:38:27.591 --> 01:38:29.771]  So, finishing up, there's so many rabbit trails.
[01:38:30.111 --> 01:38:31.072]  Where do you see it going?
[01:38:31.352 --> 01:38:32.852]  How do you see it breaking down, and we're going to calls?
[01:38:32.932 --> 01:38:39.254]  Well, first of all, I think that they, when I talk about they, I talk about the power elite.
[01:38:39.294 --> 01:38:44.896]  They're going to do everything they can to keep the economy at least reasonable through the election.
[01:38:45.416 --> 01:38:46.977]  That's what it appears right now.
[01:38:47.717 --> 01:38:51.960]  And I think that they're going to have their Hegelian event after the election.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:52.901]  That's my opinion.
[01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:58.465]  And they keep saying that, they keep saying, oh that way it's a new slate and attacking Iran is going to be okay.
[01:38:59.446 --> 01:39:02.067]  They keep saying Barack Obama will bring us back together.
[01:39:02.087 --> 01:39:09.513]  They don't mean the people together, they mean the people back conned, believing one more time, taking one more ride, that there is a difference in the government.
[01:39:09.966 --> 01:39:17.291]  Yeah, and so, you know, it's kind of funny, that movie, Wag the Dog, there's a new movie coming out in June called The Event.
[01:39:17.391 --> 01:39:19.973]  I don't know if you've seen it, but it's... No, I haven't.
[01:39:20.513 --> 01:39:25.837]  It's the trailer, it's just about exactly what you and I are talking about, and they're just, you know, they're just getting us ready for it.
[01:39:25.857 --> 01:39:27.057]  Oh yeah, that's the movie with...
[01:39:28.118 --> 01:39:29.920]  With the fella who lives here in Austin, Quaid.
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:30.980]  I can't remember.
[01:39:31.881 --> 01:39:33.522]  And it's about stage terror in Europe, right?
[01:39:33.602 --> 01:39:41.609]  Yeah, it's just truly amazing how, just like your caller said, they are so blatant about it and nobody's really even paying attention.
[01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.989]  512-646-5400.
[01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:42.069]  512-646-5400.
[01:39:42.089 --> 01:39:43.570]  About to go to George Humphrey.
[01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:45.572]  Before I do that, please go to his website.
[01:39:51.197 --> 01:39:53.119]  He started it, but he has somebody else running it.
[01:39:53.319 --> 01:39:54.601]  That's www.fearlove.com.
[01:39:54.621 --> 01:40:03.614]  We sell his books and videos at www.infowars.com and I hope you will get those and support George and all the work of what he and his team are doing.
[01:40:04.515 --> 01:40:05.396]  But George, finishing up.
[01:40:05.636 --> 01:40:06.758]  I mean, now you're getting into fundamentals.
[01:40:07.859 --> 01:40:25.666]  Hey, more on how somebody would protect themselves, but first, I want you to get a little bit into, I understand you're not making a prediction here, but if you had to forecast and say, dead reckoning, just like you're in a ship 500 years ago, I think if we sail 100 miles this way, we're going to run into this island.
[01:40:26.386 --> 01:40:27.786]  I mean, that's easy to figure out.
[01:40:28.527 --> 01:40:40.670]  If you extrapolate what's going on, and it looks pretty clear to me that in the second or third quarter of next year is that there's going to be some real difficult times.
[01:40:41.190 --> 01:40:46.872]  But I would even hazard a guess to say that there's going to be another Hegelian event
[01:40:47.632 --> 01:40:49.374]  of the size of 9-1-1 or even larger.
[01:40:49.494 --> 01:40:52.237]  And then they'll crash the economy saying that caused it.
[01:40:52.437 --> 01:40:57.142]  And so the psychological blame goes on the cave boogeyman rather than on the bankers.
[01:40:57.363 --> 01:40:58.244]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:58.284 --> 01:41:04.610]  And we started it with Randy Weaver and then it went to Waco and then it went to Oklahoma City and then TWA Flight 800 and then 9-1-1.
[01:41:06.272 --> 01:41:17.318]  And, you know, all you have to do is look at the rabbit trail and it's pretty clear that this is probably going to happen unless enough people wake up and start saying, no, we're going to take that country.
[01:41:17.358 --> 01:41:19.199]  And exposing the government sponsor terror paradigm.
[01:41:19.319 --> 01:41:26.442]  And so, basically, you know, we have a little bit of time, and that little bit of time is extremely precious.
[01:41:26.482 --> 01:41:29.524]  So there's four areas that I'm really talking about.
[01:41:29.604 --> 01:41:31.165]  Taking care of yourself financially.
[01:41:31.665 --> 01:41:45.387]  Taking care of the food that you eat taking care of your exercise and your health and creating community Those are the four things because we have to be focused we have to put our intention on Solving the problem not just looking at the problems right now
[01:41:47.453 --> 01:41:52.396]  And I agree, we should have a positive attitude, because then that draws people to us, people believe we can affect change.
[01:41:52.416 --> 01:42:03.901]  I mean, I've always actually been real positive in that I've said, we can win, we can fight back, they're not gods, they're not invincible, we can change history, but we can't end fight and sit around ninnying.
[01:42:04.882 --> 01:42:07.243]  But then some people say I get negative when I talk about all the bad.
[01:42:07.263 --> 01:42:09.644]  I am trying to show people how serious it is.
[01:42:09.664 --> 01:42:10.845]  It's like showing somebody a cliff.
[01:42:11.405 --> 01:42:14.908]  Or showing a kid a dead squirrel on the street and saying, don't go out on the street.
[01:42:15.168 --> 01:42:18.531]  It's not negative, it's taking something negative and making it positive.
[01:42:18.571 --> 01:42:20.292]  I'm actually a very positive person.
[01:42:20.452 --> 01:42:21.013]  Absolutely.
[01:42:21.774 --> 01:42:28.199]  As you know, I go to India every year and Mahatma Gandhi is one of my true idols and he's a person of, you know,
[01:42:28.579 --> 01:42:29.920]  I've studied all my life.
[01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:35.342]  But a lot of people think Mahatma Gandhi was a totally non-violent person, but no, he was not.
[01:42:35.662 --> 01:42:46.767]  He believed in what was called Ahimsa, or the least violence necessary, and he said it was better for a man to go to war and fight and kill others to protect his country than be a coward
[01:42:48.368 --> 01:42:50.809]  And say that he was for non-violence.
[01:42:50.849 --> 01:42:56.751]  To be for non-violence and to be for peace takes a courageous heart.
[01:42:57.071 --> 01:43:04.874]  And I'll tell you what, where you have done just wonders, is that your courage is just unbelievable!
[01:43:04.894 --> 01:43:12.337]  And everybody knows it, and you've injected this level of courage and this fearlessness in waking people up.
[01:43:12.657 --> 01:43:15.558]  And now the question is, and you've woken up
[01:43:16.338 --> 01:43:40.952]  Hundreds of thousands of people this thing called the first awakening to the reality that this thing is illusion It's a big monster It's out to eat us and now but the reality is is that if we're gonna get through this thing We have to be aware of that stuff We have to understand how bad they are and at the same time we have to transcend Change our paradigm and become aware of what's called the second awakening be aware of our own personal power
[01:43:41.032 --> 01:43:44.933]  Well, I agree, and it is about awakening, because the average person is in a dream state.
[01:43:44.973 --> 01:43:47.834]  They admit that after an hour of TV, you go into a low dream state.
[01:43:48.214 --> 01:43:49.315]  Video games even lower.
[01:43:49.335 --> 01:43:50.095]  I mean, just Google it.
[01:43:50.115 --> 01:43:50.955]  It's mainstream news.
[01:43:51.335 --> 01:43:53.336]  And the average person is like sleepwalking.
[01:43:53.576 --> 01:43:54.997]  That's why they don't want to talk to you.
[01:43:55.197 --> 01:44:05.300]  They're like drones, and I want to shake them up and wake them up in the bad, not exercising, sluggish, endorphins, bad food, but also not thinking.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:10.196]  You know, they admit that's one big reason that Alzheimer's is exploding.
[01:44:10.216 --> 01:44:11.280]  The brain is just shutting down.
[01:44:12.145 --> 01:44:13.946]  Well, there's no question about that.
[01:44:15.487 --> 01:44:18.869]  I'm writing a new book right now, and other people are talking about this.
[01:44:18.889 --> 01:44:20.269]  There's many, many other people.
[01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:21.450]  There's four things.
[01:44:21.490 --> 01:44:22.590]  We've got to stay out of debt.
[01:44:22.650 --> 01:44:26.573]  We've got to make sure that we eat clean and healthy and fresh food.
[01:44:27.033 --> 01:44:28.934]  We've got to increase our exercise.
[01:44:28.974 --> 01:44:35.437]  Unless you use this beautiful machine called our body and really take care of it, you're not going to be powerful.
[01:44:35.817 --> 01:44:38.719]  And most importantly, use the most important muscle
[01:44:39.199 --> 01:44:42.381]  In the whole world, which is our brain and our heart, together.
[01:44:43.502 --> 01:44:48.504]  Bring the left and right together, and be aware that God does not make junk.
[01:44:49.005 --> 01:44:51.706]  We are part of God's creation.
[01:44:51.746 --> 01:44:56.929]  We are co-creators in this universe, and the Illuminati has done everything they can.
[01:44:56.949 --> 01:45:04.414]  Well, no, that really is it, because the Bible says that we're made in the image of the creator of the universe, and look at what humans envision within decades is built.
[01:45:05.074 --> 01:45:09.838]  I mean, we literally, we haven't even begun to realize what we can do.
[01:45:10.718 --> 01:45:13.601]  Our potential is unlimited.
[01:45:14.061 --> 01:45:19.325]  You know, it's like for the last hundred years, we've had this television in front of us.
[01:45:19.345 --> 01:45:19.906]  And they're greedy.
[01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:20.826]  The globalists know that.
[01:45:20.846 --> 01:45:21.427]  They're afraid.
[01:45:21.707 --> 01:45:23.268]  They really do want to suppress us.
[01:45:23.609 --> 01:45:25.350]  That's why they put sodium fluoride in the water.
[01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:28.572]  I mean, admittedly, that's why they give us shots.
[01:45:28.833 --> 01:45:31.235]  That's why they're spraying the skies with the chemtrails.
[01:45:31.275 --> 01:45:33.877]  Have you heard they're now admitting they're doing it, but saying it's for global warming?
[01:45:34.778 --> 01:45:38.239]  The Department of Energy came out and said, yeah, we added the fuel, we're spraying, shut up.
[01:45:38.639 --> 01:45:47.921]  You know, the amazing thing is, I have some very, very aware friends that if you even say the word chemtrails, is that they go ballistic.
[01:45:48.321 --> 01:45:53.022]  The conditioning that has been put on people in this nation is just unbelievable.
[01:45:53.322 --> 01:45:55.303]  I mean, the people of this country
[01:45:56.403 --> 01:45:59.705]  They won't even look up and see what's going on.
[01:46:00.345 --> 01:46:03.907]  And so that is the hardest thing to change, is a person's mind.
[01:46:03.947 --> 01:46:14.472]  But the first and most important thing is to change our own mind, to change our own paradigm, and realize that this television set that we've been looking at, called life, is there's more than one channel.
[01:46:14.512 --> 01:46:20.295]  There's a whole bunch of different channels, and that we can turn the channel, and the Illuminati don't want us to be turning the channel.
[01:46:20.435 --> 01:46:20.875]  No, I agree.
[01:46:20.915 --> 01:46:22.596]  That's a good analogy, turning the channel.
[01:46:23.597 --> 01:46:24.477]  And I want to get more into this.
[01:46:24.937 --> 01:46:26.578]  Maybe the show will go over a little bit into the next hour.
[01:46:26.598 --> 01:46:27.119]  We've got time.
[01:46:27.159 --> 01:46:29.780]  We need to go to calls right now, but I want to get back into this.
[01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:31.041]  Let's move quickly.
[01:46:31.081 --> 01:46:32.882]  George in Indiana, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:46:33.542 --> 01:46:34.323]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:46:34.543 --> 01:46:35.884]  Yeah, Alex, a couple things.
[01:46:36.064 --> 01:46:45.069]  One is, to all your audience that may have people out there thinking about the Republican and Democrat, you know what the definition of an idiot is?
[01:46:45.449 --> 01:46:49.291]  That's someone who tries the same thing over and over and expects a different result.
[01:46:50.003 --> 01:46:53.064]  And we're never going to get anything but what we got with those people in office.
[01:46:54.064 --> 01:46:55.265]  I agree with you, bang on their head in the wall.
[01:46:55.805 --> 01:47:02.307]  Now the next thing is, and this is to Lord Rottenchild and all these people out here screaming about this fake global warming.
[01:47:02.327 --> 01:47:03.508]  There's something very serious.
[01:47:03.568 --> 01:47:05.088]  We have a global catastrophe.
[01:47:05.528 --> 01:47:07.629]  And Alex, I don't know if you've talked about this.
[01:47:07.769 --> 01:47:10.110]  I might have missed one of your shows because I try and watch them all.
[01:47:10.714 --> 01:47:14.036]  But we have an island of trash floating in the Atlantic.
[01:47:14.376 --> 01:47:14.836]  Pacific.
[01:47:14.896 --> 01:47:19.558]  Between California and Japan that's twice the size of the United States.
[01:47:19.818 --> 01:47:21.619]  Why in the heck ain't he talking about that?
[01:47:22.399 --> 01:47:22.940]  No, no, no.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.502]  It's making it to our... Let me add something here, and this is a key point I keep making, and I have talked about the island of trash.
[01:47:27.542 --> 01:47:28.102]  Okay.
[01:47:28.928 --> 01:47:37.016]  You have genetic engineering, where they have DNA guns that randomly fire into everything, already giving rise to super-virus, super-bacteria, recombinant.
[01:47:37.477 --> 01:47:45.545]  They've got giant cyclotrons where all the equations, and they admit it could blow the earth up or cause, you know, I mean, hundred-year-old equations made A-bombs.
[01:47:45.585 --> 01:47:47.327]  This is stuff thousands of times more advanced.
[01:47:48.287 --> 01:47:49.988]  They're busy making antimatter bombs.
[01:47:50.028 --> 01:47:53.571]  They're busy cloning humans, chimeras with other species.
[01:47:54.071 --> 01:47:56.933]  The elite are doing all these horrible environmental things.
[01:47:57.313 --> 01:47:59.975]  They actually love destroying the earth because they're really dark.
[01:47:59.995 --> 01:48:00.915]  They're a dark force.
[01:48:01.195 --> 01:48:01.876]  They love death.
[01:48:02.396 --> 01:48:03.717]  They revel in destroying lives.
[01:48:03.737 --> 01:48:05.598]  When they get their energy, they're predatory.
[01:48:05.638 --> 01:48:06.399]  They're parasitic.
[01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:07.780]  They're destructive.
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:09.200]  They're vampires.
[01:48:09.221 --> 01:48:10.221]  Yeah, they're vampires.
[01:48:10.701 --> 01:48:12.623]  We've been invaded by aliens.
[01:48:14.014 --> 01:48:18.540]  How could another human do something to another human and not expect... George, comment on their nature.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.702]  In fact, I wanted to, after we took calls, and I appreciate your calls, sir.
[01:48:20.763 --> 01:48:22.064]  Great point.
[01:48:22.705 --> 01:48:24.507]  Why do they love hurting beauty?
[01:48:24.668 --> 01:48:25.429]  Well again, it's...
[01:48:27.463 --> 01:48:32.586]  It's a point of view, and in this human third-dimensional existence there are polarities.
[01:48:32.626 --> 01:48:34.928]  There's yin and yang, male and female, dark and light.
[01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:49.897]  And on one end of the polarity there is unity consciousness, which believes in love and process and law, and the other end of the process is domination, is control, is evil.
[01:48:50.157 --> 01:48:52.778]  The opposite of the word live is evil.
[01:48:54.239 --> 01:49:01.261]  And when you're not living in God's universal laws, you're acting evilly because you're shutting down life.
[01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:02.542]  That's right, breaking the law.
[01:49:02.622 --> 01:49:05.002]  They're like raccoons.
[01:49:05.062 --> 01:49:10.464]  If they can't take it, they scratch it and they defecate on it and they destroy it.
[01:49:10.864 --> 01:49:16.606]  And just like we talked about the movie Wag the Dog, is that all of these vampire movies
[01:49:16.946 --> 01:49:23.588]  All these vampire movies are telling us, right to our face, that the elite have this separation consciousness.
[01:49:23.628 --> 01:49:33.431]  They believe that their only power is by taking from others, by taking from the blood, which has always been the metaphysical example of the soul.
[01:49:34.731 --> 01:49:42.337]  It's so obvious, and you can go to any movie theater, and in the trailers there's always at least one or two vampire movies.
[01:49:42.698 --> 01:49:47.021]  They are programming this stuff into us so amazingly.
[01:49:47.161 --> 01:49:48.922]  It's really a big game.
[01:49:49.263 --> 01:49:59.230]  And if we can see it as a game, instead of reacting in fear, but if we can see it as a game and kind of laugh at it, but at the same time realize that we have to be soldiers and stand up against this.
[01:49:59.251 --> 01:49:59.671]  Well, I've got an idea.
[01:49:59.691 --> 01:50:00.872]  I want to drag them all out in the sun.
[01:50:01.894 --> 01:50:05.616]  Well, absolutely, and that's what you're doing with this show, is that you're dragging them out in the sun.
[01:50:06.537 --> 01:50:14.861]  And the important thing is, is that you've been doing every single person who's listening to you today has to gain and gather their own power and make a decision.
[01:50:14.921 --> 01:50:15.781]  Which side are you on?
[01:50:15.801 --> 01:50:20.984]  Do you believe in law and peace, and do you believe in love, and do you believe in God, or do you believe in these vampires?
[01:50:21.464 --> 01:50:29.889]  And I would guess that 95% plus of the people that you're listening to believe in the good qualities of the Constitution of the Republic.
[01:50:30.069 --> 01:50:32.752]  And you also see a lot of weak people who aren't even evil themselves.
[01:50:32.772 --> 01:50:38.359]  They're attracted to the trappings of vampirism and death and paleness and all of that.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.661]  And it's because they're weak.
[01:50:39.681 --> 01:50:41.803]  They're subconsciously afraid of the darkness.
[01:50:41.884 --> 01:50:43.526]  Yeah, and if you go along with it, you're
[01:50:46.168 --> 01:50:48.229]  You're part of it, and you have to make a decision.
[01:50:48.469 --> 01:50:49.230]  We're human beings.
[01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:51.311]  I'll tell you this, at the end of the day, the enemy is weak.
[01:50:52.432 --> 01:50:57.975]  They've gotten the high ground because we were blind working down in the fields, but they are weak, and they are scared.
[01:50:58.015 --> 01:50:58.535]  You know what?
[01:50:58.835 --> 01:51:00.696]  I do see fear in the elite's eyes now.
[01:51:00.736 --> 01:51:01.717]  There's no question about it.
[01:51:01.737 --> 01:51:04.258]  Ten years ago, because they know we're going to get our hands around their chicken necks.
[01:51:04.478 --> 01:51:06.719]  We, as human beings, are powerful.
[01:51:06.779 --> 01:51:18.045]  We are multidimensional beings that have far, far more power, and there's far more power in universal law, in truth and love, than there is in separation and domination and hate.
[01:51:18.866 --> 01:51:20.507]  That's just a metaphysical principle.
[01:51:20.807 --> 01:51:29.131]  But this existence that we're having right now is a way for each of us to learn.
[01:51:29.212 --> 01:51:33.794]  It's a contrast, and we can become aware of it, and it depends upon where we put it.
[01:51:33.954 --> 01:51:35.536]  Life is a journey, it is a test.
[01:51:35.576 --> 01:51:36.417]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:51:36.517 --> 01:51:38.900]  And it's a wonderful time to be alive.
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:40.021]  It is a wonderful time.
[01:51:40.041 --> 01:51:41.443]  No, no, we're blessed to be alive in this tribulation.
[01:51:41.483 --> 01:51:47.049]  Absolutely, because it gives us the opportunity to make the greatest spiritual evolution.
[01:51:47.089 --> 01:51:48.711]  Well, you know, you always want to get into the spiritual now.
[01:51:48.851 --> 01:51:58.339]  Because I know over the decades you've gotten more into this, but it's true that I've also caught a lot of those teaching atheism and teaching humanism, that their real leaders are really into the occult.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.504]  And they know there's power in it, so they want to blind the mass to the fact that it even exists.
[01:52:03.544 --> 01:52:06.667]  The old thing of the devil's biggest trick was convincing you nothing was there.
[01:52:06.687 --> 01:52:07.287]  Can you speak to that?
[01:52:07.407 --> 01:52:08.148]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:52:08.208 --> 01:52:14.574]  And the biggest thing that they have going is that they want us to be disconnected from Source.
[01:52:15.214 --> 01:52:27.857]  Because the law of allowance and the law of attraction is that we are part of and basic... Atheists always bemoan that we're made to be spiritual.
[01:52:28.217 --> 01:52:29.997]  They say, why is it?
[01:52:30.297 --> 01:52:31.998]  And it's their choice to believe that.
[01:52:32.118 --> 01:52:34.418]  And that doesn't mean the fraud churches and the mad lion type.
[01:52:34.458 --> 01:52:36.859]  And it's their choice to believe that.
[01:52:38.599 --> 01:53:02.104]  You know, all you have to do is go outside and walk down Barton Creek and see how beautiful it is, and just be quiet for 20 minutes and realize that this is not a cosmic mistake, is that this is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful creation that is all over this universe, and that it is up to each one of us to imbibe and to follow the universal laws of this universe.
[01:53:02.344 --> 01:53:07.005]  And if we do that, then we have no fear, we do what is right, we stand
[01:53:07.045 --> 01:53:07.806]  Well that's another point.
[01:53:07.846 --> 01:53:11.148]  The globalists, the more they get into evil, the more scared and freaked out they get.
[01:53:11.428 --> 01:53:15.772]  And so they think they have to burrow deeper into evil to be able to get some type of satisfaction.
[01:53:15.932 --> 01:53:17.673]  It's also a black hole trap for them.
[01:53:17.693 --> 01:53:22.277]  And that's also part of the reason that they're just destroying this environment as quickly as possible.
[01:53:22.337 --> 01:53:25.779]  Because the environment is the closest link each person has.
[01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:26.440]  And it tortures them.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:27.241]  It tortures them.
[01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:27.581]  Yeah.
[01:53:28.996 --> 01:53:30.857]  I mean, this is big stuff, folks!
[01:53:30.997 --> 01:53:35.080]  I mean, you know, I'm sure every one of you have heard this before.
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.222]  It's like it energizes us, it tortures them.
[01:53:37.582 --> 01:53:38.302]  Absolutely.
[01:53:38.463 --> 01:53:44.967]  And, you know, all you have to do is go out and get some fresh sunshine, look at the flowers, play with the kids.
[01:53:45.007 --> 01:53:47.128]  You don't have to think about this stuff all the time.
[01:53:47.649 --> 01:53:52.212]  Just turning the TV off, rolling in the clover, really hurts the neural order.
[01:53:52.472 --> 01:54:09.458]  Absolutely, and taking care of your family, taking care of your home, getting fresh cut flowers, sitting down and praying with your brothers and sisters and your family, doing the things that families used to do for hundreds of years.
[01:54:09.958 --> 01:54:13.319]  And this is not some stupid out-of-the-way thing.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:16.020]  This is what life is about.
[01:54:16.140 --> 01:54:17.661]  Why are we here on this planet?
[01:54:17.841 --> 01:54:26.284]  Are we here just to accumulate more and more stuff and more and more power, or are we here to become aware of what and who we really are?
[01:54:26.644 --> 01:54:27.084]  Absolutely.
[01:54:27.124 --> 01:54:27.964]  Let's take another call.
[01:54:28.924 --> 01:54:30.545]  Let's talk to Freedom in California.
[01:54:30.585 --> 01:54:31.465]  You're on the air, Freedom.
[01:54:32.306 --> 01:54:34.286]  Hi Alex, good to talk to you again.
[01:54:35.266 --> 01:54:40.088]  I sent you an email a few days back regarding the call last time I called in last week.
[01:54:40.428 --> 01:54:46.350]  I was wondering, have you had a chance to look at that as far as the CNN fake video stuff?
[01:54:47.532 --> 01:54:54.714]  Yes, I have with the no planes hitting tower one or two, and it's just more of the same stuff.
[01:54:55.474 --> 01:54:59.175]  But on this show, we're talking about the economy and the whole global system right now.
[01:54:59.215 --> 01:55:03.456]  You're welcome to call in about this if you want, but I'm not going to get off into a discussion about it.
[01:55:04.097 --> 01:55:05.677]  Okay, sure.
[01:55:05.837 --> 01:55:11.198]  As far as solutions, can I raise something in regards to solutions?
[01:55:11.899 --> 01:55:13.039]  Yeah, you can talk about whatever you want, sir.
[01:55:13.993 --> 01:55:19.037]  Yeah, you know, we have a choice when the New World Order cracks down on us.
[01:55:19.257 --> 01:55:23.801]  You know, they come and arrest us, they break down our doors, they arrest us on the street for different things.
[01:55:24.421 --> 01:55:25.522]  We do have options.
[01:55:25.562 --> 01:55:28.725]  We can go into court and there are papers that we can file.
[01:55:28.765 --> 01:55:30.987]  I'm not talking about liens or anything like that.
[01:55:31.167 --> 01:55:33.909]  I won't bring up what I did last time.
[01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:36.131]  You know, there's something called consent.
[01:55:36.771 --> 01:55:41.095]  And we're ruled, the government rules with the consent of the governed.
[01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:50.958]  And, uh, if we didn't agree to certain things just because the collective, and it's assumed that the collective has agreed to certain things, the individual hasn't necessarily.
[01:55:50.998 --> 01:55:53.202]  They have to have the individual's consent.
[01:55:53.897 --> 01:55:56.819]  Well, I agree they have in the past.
[01:55:56.999 --> 01:56:07.246]  There's a process of moving us off the English Anglo-Saxon common law onto this imperial force majeure law of the gun.
[01:56:07.266 --> 01:56:11.408]  But yes, you can get remedies.
[01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:17.752]  And certainly people should investigate the law and learn their rights and question everything.
[01:56:18.473 --> 01:56:19.934]  Question what a doctor is giving you.
[01:56:19.954 --> 01:56:20.894]  I mean, all of it.
[01:56:21.315 --> 01:56:23.036]  I wasn't pooh-poohing anything you said about that.
[01:56:24.306 --> 01:56:36.636]  Okay, well, um, yeah, I just think it has, there's, um, going to court and dealing with this stuff quite a bit, it does have a lot to do with intent, um, because you have to intend to break the law, so intent and consent.
[01:56:37.157 --> 01:56:43.802]  So one of the things that people are doing now is filing a notice of intent, of non-consent, and it's not going to get people
[01:56:44.892 --> 01:56:46.213]  That's not going to get anybody in trouble.
[01:56:46.353 --> 01:56:47.934]  Okay, well, listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:56:48.815 --> 01:57:00.702]  Look, I'm always a little skeptical because 98% of these patriot wizards of law, you know, everybody gets jacked up and all excited and I've seen so many friends and locals go to jail or, you know, weird stuff.
[01:57:01.663 --> 01:57:09.228]  But knowing just the Bill of Rights and Constitution and demanding procedure, demanding a trial, demanding witnesses, a lot of times they will just drop your case.
[01:57:09.248 --> 01:57:12.069]  They'll try to threaten you into plea bargaining up until that point.
[01:57:12.170 --> 01:57:13.170]  George, any comments on that?
[01:57:14.591 --> 01:57:34.787]  Unfortunately in this existence that we have right now, what we came into in this republic is that we had Christian common law, English Christian common law, that put the individual first and it looked at the whole situation and quite clearly in the last 75 years we've gone from Christian common law to UCC law, which takes care of the corporations.
[01:57:35.367 --> 01:57:38.770]  Anytime you walk into a courtroom where there's a flag, where there's the gold,
[01:57:39.210 --> 01:57:46.158]  It's all Admiralty, and you have no rights as a citizen as soon as you walk into that bar.
[01:57:46.198 --> 01:57:49.983]  Anybody that doubts this, the bar is the British Accredited Registry.
[01:57:50.003 --> 01:57:54.468]  Well, I mean, with the income tax, you report on yourself, you violate your 4th and 5th Amendment,
[01:57:54.788 --> 01:57:58.250]  You give them all this stuff, and then there's no judge jury.
[01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:59.670]  They just grab your back against you.
[01:57:59.830 --> 01:58:04.172]  It's like walking into a den of thieves and saying, you know, we've got to play by the rules.
[01:58:04.252 --> 01:58:08.054]  And I admire anybody who wants to go ahead and do that.
[01:58:08.214 --> 01:58:10.115]  That's just not where I'm going to fight my battle.
[01:58:11.277 --> 01:58:21.086]  Well, I just never have these guests on who claim they've got this magic way to fix everything, because a decade ago, I did have a few of them on, and they'd say, sign up a trust.
[01:58:21.587 --> 01:58:23.929]  And then people would sign up a trust, and they'd take the person's property.
[01:58:24.429 --> 01:58:26.091]  There's a lot of charlatans out there.
[01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:28.273]  I'll tell you who I believe in.
[01:58:28.313 --> 01:58:33.338]  George Gordon's got good info, but it's mainline, common law, and holding them to it.
[01:58:33.658 --> 01:58:35.060]  There's people like Larry Becraft.
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:40.084]  Tommy Cryer, and you notice they're getting people off text things.
[01:58:40.124 --> 01:58:41.865]  I mean, they're actually having wins.
[01:58:43.466 --> 01:58:57.698]  I know that Randy Kelton's info here locally in Texas has actually had some successes, but it's mainline, using the common law and using procedure on them, not magic filings and declaring that I'm under the Tooth Fairy's tutelage.
[01:58:58.178 --> 01:58:58.459]  Go ahead.
[01:58:58.959 --> 01:58:59.259]  Anything else?
[01:58:59.580 --> 01:59:05.024]  No, I just, you know, I only have so much time, energy, and money, and, you know, that's not where I choose to be.
[01:59:05.044 --> 01:59:05.624]  That's what I'm saying!
[01:59:05.644 --> 01:59:09.508]  People obsess that it's all Catholics, it's all Jews, it's all Chewbacabras.
[01:59:09.848 --> 01:59:20.076]  You know, regardless of who's at the tip-top of the New World Order, I mean, I'm there fighting, hey, there's poison in your water, hey, they're spraying you, hey, they're getting rid of our sovereignty, hey, there's a gun built at the Capitol, let's beat it!
[01:59:20.216 --> 01:59:21.137]  And we're having victories!
[01:59:21.617 --> 01:59:27.898]  The people listening out driving around in their cars right now, they want to hear solutions and they want to hear what we're facing and what the enemy's doing.
[01:59:28.118 --> 01:59:31.359]  And that's one reason I've had success, is that we're always covering the topics.
[01:59:31.379 --> 01:59:32.559]  We're always covering the info.
[01:59:32.919 --> 01:59:39.321]  I mean, have you noticed that in the awakening movement, so much of it gets into infighting and who's right and who's got the exact answers?
[01:59:39.581 --> 01:59:45.542]  Hey, it's about wanting the truth, being brothers and sisters together, and moving forward, and none of us are going to agree with everybody.
[01:59:45.962 --> 01:59:47.904]  Yeah, that is so important.
[01:59:47.924 --> 01:59:50.567]  I've been around this stuff for a long, long time now.
[01:59:50.987 --> 01:59:56.532]  And just like George Washington said, be friends with everyone and be allied with no one.
[01:59:57.113 --> 02:00:03.699]  And in this Patriot Movement, I just do my very best to see the best of everyone.
[02:00:03.739 --> 02:00:04.620]  There's a lot of clicks.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.942]  There's a lot of clicks.
[02:00:05.982 --> 02:00:06.762]  And you know what?
[02:00:07.483 --> 02:00:09.844]  Just do your best to see the positive.
[02:00:09.864 --> 02:00:11.864]  Yeah, I got out of high school and college a long time ago.
[02:00:11.884 --> 02:00:19.946]  Do your best to see the positive and don't be shooting on each other because we've got so much work to do.
[02:00:19.966 --> 02:00:22.446]  When you read Go and Tell Pro documents, that's how the government did it.
[02:00:22.986 --> 02:00:24.607]  They would just go get groups fighting with each other.
[02:00:24.987 --> 02:00:30.988]  So instead of being in the streets, waking people up, having an effect, and moving forward, it was just all, you're disinfo, you're...
[02:00:31.528 --> 02:00:39.292]  No folks, the people that are good are telling you we can win, we have power, the new order must be defeated, the war must be stopped, the borders must be controlled.
[02:00:41.215 --> 02:00:42.216]  Look at the fruit, too.
[02:00:42.276 --> 02:00:43.176]  Look at what people produce.
[02:00:43.216 --> 02:00:46.258]  Is it dissension and infighting, or is it waking people up?
[02:00:46.358 --> 02:00:54.843]  You know, and the thing about this is, a lot of people are afraid to get really involved in this because they think they're going to lose friends, or they're going to lose social situations.
[02:00:55.583 --> 02:01:05.228]  I guarantee you, if you're sitting on the fence right now, you will find the most awake and alive and the most vibrant people in the world who are doing this stuff.
[02:01:05.488 --> 02:01:05.789]  Absolutely.
[02:01:05.809 --> 02:01:06.689]  Let's take another call here.
[02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:09.070]  Let's talk to Steve in Las Vegas.
[02:01:09.090 --> 02:01:09.751]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:01:11.343 --> 02:01:12.064]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:01:12.644 --> 02:01:13.204]  Good, my friend.
[02:01:13.845 --> 02:01:14.065]  Good.
[02:01:14.205 --> 02:01:16.427]  Hey, I just want to say that you have an awesome show.
[02:01:16.447 --> 02:01:17.768]  I appreciate being on the show.
[02:01:17.788 --> 02:01:31.599]  You guys are doing a great thing, and I was just recently, you know, heard about your show and everything, and I just am amazed at all this stuff that's going on, and all these people are just blind.
[02:01:31.659 --> 02:01:39.005]  I admit I was one of those people, and I got to find out about Ron Paul, and oh my gosh,
[02:01:40.907 --> 02:01:43.370]  Ron Paul has been a great window.
[02:01:43.931 --> 02:01:45.333]  People say he's not hardcore enough.
[02:01:45.373 --> 02:01:45.673]  He's not.
[02:01:45.934 --> 02:01:46.454]  No, he is.
[02:01:46.475 --> 02:01:48.537]  He woke up 30 plus million people in the U.S.
[02:01:48.557 --> 02:01:49.158]  That's the numbers.
[02:01:49.839 --> 02:01:54.265]  And now they're finding, they went from baby food to now they're getting the steak and potatoes.
[02:01:54.886 --> 02:01:57.109]  And I'll let you continue to comment, but I want to hear George's take on that.
[02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:59.831]  Ron Paul is my hero.
[02:01:59.971 --> 02:02:02.633]  The guy is... I've spent time with him.
[02:02:02.853 --> 02:02:06.996]  The guy is absolute... He is just Mr. Integrity.
[02:02:07.016 --> 02:02:09.538]  He's incredibly intelligent.
[02:02:09.658 --> 02:02:10.819]  He's dedicated.
[02:02:10.899 --> 02:02:15.002]  He's 71 years old and he works harder than a 25-year-old.
[02:02:15.463 --> 02:02:21.768]  He is so articulate and he keeps it simple and focused and his heart is full of love.
[02:02:22.748 --> 02:02:23.329]  Amazing guy.
[02:02:24.175 --> 02:02:24.575]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:02:24.595 --> 02:02:25.515]  Go ahead and finish up.
[02:02:26.035 --> 02:02:29.156]  Okay, and my thing is, we know who these elitists are.
[02:02:29.196 --> 02:02:30.316]  We know the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:30.416 --> 02:02:33.997]  We have insiders knowing where they meet.
[02:02:34.437 --> 02:02:36.018]  How come we just don't take care of them?
[02:02:36.038 --> 02:02:37.278]  I know we're not supposed to use force.
[02:02:37.338 --> 02:02:38.258]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:02:38.438 --> 02:02:43.279]  They've built an evil hierarchy around them, and half the time it's their own minions killing them.
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:44.540]  It's like shark teeth.
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:49.121]  The evil mechanism's been set up just because there's less than a hundred top globalists
[02:02:50.602 --> 02:02:52.743]  You know, they need to be brought to justice, then they need to go to prison.
[02:02:52.984 --> 02:02:56.246]  We first have to expose them fully, but it's the system itself.
[02:02:56.266 --> 02:02:58.548]  See, this is a self-fulfilling machine.
[02:02:58.568 --> 02:03:01.010]  You want to explain how institutions work, George?
[02:03:01.471 --> 02:03:07.736]  Well, it's all based upon the pyramid, and the pyramid as a system has been used for a long time.
[02:03:07.776 --> 02:03:12.199]  It was especially effective during when, not Nigeria, when
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:13.860]  Egypt?
[02:03:14.181 --> 02:03:14.861]  Not Morocco.
[02:03:15.041 --> 02:03:15.641]  What's the country?
[02:03:15.801 --> 02:03:18.263]  Algeria was fighting for independence from France.
[02:03:18.723 --> 02:03:25.887]  And only a small number of people, two or three people, at the top of the pyramid have all of the information.
[02:03:26.367 --> 02:03:31.870]  And then they give compartmentalized information down to the next level and they have more information.
[02:03:31.970 --> 02:03:37.092]  And those people give compartmentalized information down to the next level and down to the next level.
[02:03:37.132 --> 02:03:42.015]  So if you get anybody at the bottom or the middle or even toward the top of the pyramid,
[02:03:42.455 --> 02:03:48.899]  They will only have so much information that will be compartmentalized, and they won't know even who is around them.
[02:03:48.979 --> 02:03:49.540]  It sells.
[02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:52.182]  And it's the ultimate power trip.
[02:03:52.502 --> 02:03:53.783]  They know they're poisoning the water.
[02:03:53.843 --> 02:03:58.246]  They know they've developed live-extension technologies that they're going to get that we're not going to get.
[02:03:58.486 --> 02:04:04.990]  It's the ultimate power trip that we're down in this frozen reality with slow technological development, and they're in these technological spires.
[02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:07.552]  Yeah, and it's really amazing.
[02:04:07.592 --> 02:04:11.755]  You can go downtown Austin, Texas, and go down and talk to the head of a
[02:04:13.464 --> 02:04:18.828]  Probably the most controlled Illuminati corporation in Austin, Texas.
[02:04:19.168 --> 02:04:26.874]  And the odds are that the fellow or the woman who's in charge of that won't be able to know the whole picture, because they're at a relatively low level.
[02:04:27.314 --> 02:04:30.717]  They really think that they've been able to rationalize what they're doing.
[02:04:31.357 --> 02:04:36.201]  You know, that's the problem, is that most of the people that are dealing with it... Well, I mean, here's another example of compartmentalization.
[02:04:37.041 --> 02:04:38.062]  An African U.N.
[02:04:38.142 --> 02:04:42.786]  AIDS worker giving people smallpox shots doesn't know it had AIDS that put it in the factory.
[02:04:43.286 --> 02:04:43.987]  Of course he didn't.
[02:04:44.087 --> 02:04:45.808]  In fact, most people de facto didn't know.
[02:04:45.828 --> 02:04:49.951]  It was a special engineer went in and added an ampule that was then distributed into the lot.
[02:04:49.971 --> 02:05:03.082]  Well, bringing it even closer to home, whether you're in Rhode Island or Austin, Texas or Portland, Oregon, you go to any school where they're pushing all these vaccines, they're full of Tamarisol, and the nurses think they're doing the right thing.
[02:05:03.722 --> 02:05:05.103]  They don't know.
[02:05:05.184 --> 02:05:05.884]  They're ignorant.
[02:05:05.904 --> 02:05:10.488]  And that's why information, honest information, is so essential.
[02:05:11.246 --> 02:05:13.366]  Hey George, we want to end the show right now or do ten more minutes?
[02:05:13.727 --> 02:05:14.347]  Ten more minutes.
[02:05:14.387 --> 02:05:14.747]  I love it.
[02:05:14.827 --> 02:05:15.367]  We can do whatever we want.
[02:05:15.387 --> 02:05:15.767]  Okay, great.
[02:05:15.947 --> 02:05:16.807]  Let's continue taking calls.
[02:05:16.847 --> 02:05:17.387]  Thank you, Steve.
[02:05:17.687 --> 02:05:19.228]  Let's talk to Roger in Minnesota.
[02:05:19.268 --> 02:05:19.608]  Go ahead.
[02:05:20.108 --> 02:05:20.628]  Yes, gentlemen.
[02:05:20.648 --> 02:05:21.428]  You do a great job.
[02:05:21.608 --> 02:05:22.808]  I have two quick questions.
[02:05:23.869 --> 02:05:34.971]  First of all, I've been listening to you probably about three years, and I was really excited when you expanded to the Tower, but it's kind of like I'm semi-retired, and it's kind of like
[02:05:35.535 --> 02:05:38.297]  I'm addicted to your show and I just can't not listen to it.
[02:05:38.317 --> 02:05:43.762]  You're not addicted to the show, you're addicted to being awake and at one level higher outside the box.
[02:05:43.802 --> 02:05:46.704]  It doesn't mean we have all the answers, but we're searching for the truth.
[02:05:47.084 --> 02:05:47.345]  Right.
[02:05:47.405 --> 02:05:55.671]  And so you're addicted to fully awakening and activating your soul, not just being frozen and truly being dead and living life and never being alive.
[02:05:55.711 --> 02:05:57.293]  That's a pretty good addiction right there.
[02:05:57.313 --> 02:05:59.154]  Well put.
[02:06:00.415 --> 02:06:05.199]  But I guess my question or issue on that is with so much going on and so much developing,
[02:06:05.618 --> 02:06:13.208]  And with everything in life requiring a balance, how do I find the time to keep appraised of all this?
[02:06:13.328 --> 02:06:16.652]  I don't know if I can spend four hours a day on this.
[02:06:16.672 --> 02:06:17.673]  Sir, I don't think you should.
[02:06:17.693 --> 02:06:18.494]  I don't think you should.
[02:06:19.426 --> 02:06:31.195]  You should listen when you want to, but you should, instead of listening, once you know about this stuff, check out what we're saying, find out what's true first, you know, spot check some stuff, and then get the new Drug War film and realize that that's your good work.
[02:06:31.235 --> 02:06:34.278]  Not that you need good work to be a good person, but you should want to do that.
[02:06:34.638 --> 02:06:39.862]  You should want to make copies of that, or Endgame, or Road to Tyranny, or any of the films I've made, or films I carry.
[02:06:40.102 --> 02:06:42.064]  You should want to give them to people, or once a week.
[02:06:42.464 --> 02:06:45.585]  Once a week have a barbecue, have the neighbors over.
[02:06:45.865 --> 02:06:46.586]  Make it fun.
[02:06:46.666 --> 02:06:49.127]  Say, hey, not all creepy and looking out the blinds.
[02:06:49.187 --> 02:06:49.867]  Oh, are they going to get us?
[02:06:50.107 --> 02:06:51.007]  No, this is fun.
[02:06:51.067 --> 02:06:51.928]  Come over to the pool.
[02:06:51.988 --> 02:06:56.009]  I'm going to cook veggie burgers and we're going to sit here and watch this movie.
[02:06:56.890 --> 02:06:59.931]  It's by making it a fun culture of awakening.
[02:06:59.951 --> 02:07:02.492]  So instead of making it hunkering down, oh my God, they're going to get me.
[02:07:03.132 --> 02:07:04.873]  People always say to me, you're paranoid, you're scared.
[02:07:04.913 --> 02:07:05.653]  No, I'm not scared.
[02:07:06.033 --> 02:07:06.754]  I'm committed.
[02:07:06.794 --> 02:07:07.814]  I'm scared of doing nothing.
[02:07:08.114 --> 02:07:09.695]  I'm scared of not living this one life.
[02:07:09.735 --> 02:07:11.036]  I'm scared of not doing the right thing.
[02:07:11.316 --> 02:07:13.857]  I'm scared of not being who I should be and all I can be.
[02:07:13.877 --> 02:07:16.198]  You know, the stupid army saying, be all you can be.
[02:07:17.119 --> 02:07:19.080]  We all want to be who we can be, and I want to be alive.
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:19.640]  I want to fight.
[02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:25.203]  When I'm dead and gone, I want folks to remember my ancestors, well, my progeny, to say, this is a great ancestor we had.
[02:07:25.463 --> 02:07:26.163]  He cared about us.
[02:07:26.203 --> 02:07:28.064]  You see, I don't know how to explain this.
[02:07:28.404 --> 02:07:29.805]  Whether you believe in life after death or not,
[02:07:31.101 --> 02:07:39.525]  I believe we live on through the species, and I believe that even if it isn't my same spirit even, that there will be other men and women who will live and have passion and have love.
[02:07:40.005 --> 02:07:53.672]  And I am so in love with the idea of them walking on the moons of Saturn and building space stations and living to be a thousand years old and humans building things that we would think of God's building, that it is humanity.
[02:07:53.812 --> 02:07:55.112]  I live through the genetics.
[02:07:55.252 --> 02:07:56.073]  I live through
[02:07:56.773 --> 02:08:01.177]  And now they've looked at the DNA and it's like, you know, billions of times more complex than they thought.
[02:08:01.217 --> 02:08:03.078]  I mean, it's like crystal cathedrals.
[02:08:03.118 --> 02:08:04.139]  I don't even know how to explain it.
[02:08:04.419 --> 02:08:05.580]  It's like there's so much more.
[02:08:05.761 --> 02:08:08.002]  I realize that I'm not going to die.
[02:08:08.283 --> 02:08:11.886]  I mean, even if you don't believe in God, you're not going to die as long as the species goes on.
[02:08:12.146 --> 02:08:18.471]  And the New World Order is so selfish, a lot of them, futurists, write about this, suicidal nihilists, that they want to destroy everything for everybody.
[02:08:18.711 --> 02:08:19.892]  They want to kill everything.
[02:08:20.573 --> 02:08:22.935]  George, I mean, these are vampires that destroy their own nest.
[02:08:23.215 --> 02:08:24.256]  That's beautiful.
[02:08:24.276 --> 02:08:25.237]  I love it.
[02:08:25.777 --> 02:08:36.842]  You know, and as I see it, is that reincarnation, whatever, you know, I believe in reincarnation in the more traditional levels, but I also believe in what you're saying, is that, you know, in the DNA, it's a double helix.
[02:08:37.162 --> 02:08:43.844]  There's the genetics, which is living through your ancestors, and then there is the spiritual level, which is our soul.
[02:08:44.285 --> 02:08:50.707]  And I focus more on the soul, you focus more on the ancestors, but they're both part of the yin and yang.
[02:08:50.727 --> 02:08:51.588]  I don't understand.
[02:08:51.888 --> 02:08:52.668]  I feel my ancestors.
[02:08:52.688 --> 02:08:53.749]  Yeah, well I do, too.
[02:08:53.769 --> 02:08:54.489]  I do, too.
[02:08:54.589 --> 02:09:02.634]  And I think the Native American Indian, I mean, our ancestors back in Europe focused on our ancestors.
[02:09:02.974 --> 02:09:05.396]  Yeshua talked about his ancestors.
[02:09:05.976 --> 02:09:09.138]  And so there's nothing strange about that.
[02:09:09.178 --> 02:09:10.319]  That's just part of life.
[02:09:10.399 --> 02:09:15.522]  And the point is that the most important thing is the right here and now.
[02:09:16.102 --> 02:09:22.887]  Whether we are doing the right thing, whether we're telling the truth, whether we're living in peace, whether we have joy in our hearts.
[02:09:46.462 --> 02:09:48.043]  Yes it does, and I have one other quick one.
[02:09:48.703 --> 02:10:08.350]  In the process of trying to sort this all out, I happen to believe in our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, but when I see movies like the Zeitgeist movie, which is a roll or a miss, it's really hard for me to sort this all out because some of the parallels to the
[02:10:08.951 --> 02:10:13.134]  Early Greeks or whatever, you know, as far as virgins and resurrected.
[02:10:13.534 --> 02:10:14.155]  It's all there.
[02:10:39.031 --> 02:10:47.036]  Yeah, Alex, with the 9-11 thing, I think that it's very difficult.
[02:10:47.076 --> 02:10:50.618]  It's not just hypnotism like on a TV, because I'm a hypnotherapist.
[02:10:50.719 --> 02:10:57.463]  I know when you hypnotize people once, but it's constant hypnotism, and people begin to develop a whole worldview.
[02:10:57.563 --> 02:11:03.927]  I did a 9-11, an advertisement in the paper to get a 9-11 group together just to see what would happen.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:10.382]  And four people answered my classified ad that just said, reinvestigate 9-11, and gave my phone number, meet up, you know?
[02:11:11.122 --> 02:11:14.263]  And all four of them were widows, and I'm a widower.
[02:11:15.023 --> 02:11:25.506]  So I think it's very difficult for somebody coming on 9-11 to change their, uh, change their whole worldview, and it doesn't always happen at once.
[02:11:25.647 --> 02:11:33.609]  Like, one other fella I talked to about 9-11, he just said, I couldn't face it, I took this 9-11 mysteries home, and my dad's
[02:11:34.308 --> 02:11:35.349]  I'm giving it back to you.
[02:11:35.389 --> 02:11:36.390]  We just can't deal with it.
[02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:39.813]  And then a couple months later, you know, he's on board now.
[02:11:40.013 --> 02:11:41.455]  Well, that's what I was about to say.
[02:11:41.475 --> 02:11:46.659]  I was about to say, when you plant a seed in your backyard at the end of winter, does it pop up one day later?
[02:11:48.421 --> 02:11:51.864]  No, a lot of times it pops up a month later.
[02:11:52.284 --> 02:11:53.946]  Or a lot of times you have volunteers.
[02:11:54.286 --> 02:11:56.168]  That means a seed from two, three years ago.
[02:11:57.094 --> 02:12:01.616]  Or if you bury a daffodil bulb, it doesn't necessarily come up every year.
[02:12:02.036 --> 02:12:02.956]  But then it comes up.
[02:12:03.036 --> 02:12:05.257]  So, I'm just planting seeds everywhere.
[02:12:05.277 --> 02:12:06.578]  I'm firing and forgetting.
[02:12:06.598 --> 02:12:10.039]  And if somebody laughs at you or makes fun of you, move on.
[02:12:10.559 --> 02:12:14.921]  I have found eight, nine times out of ten, down the road they come and apologize.
[02:12:15.041 --> 02:12:15.621]  Absolutely.
[02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:18.222]  And Alex, your analogies are getting better and better.
[02:12:18.682 --> 02:12:22.364]  And one of the things that this gentleman knows is that the strongest
[02:12:23.064 --> 02:12:29.226]  Psychological defense mechanism for all human beings, black, white, or Asian, is cognitive dissidence.
[02:12:29.566 --> 02:12:40.309]  Once we invest our time, energy, or money into a concept, and when we find out that we're going down the wrong road, we defend our previous point of view.
[02:12:40.450 --> 02:12:44.651]  It happens with everybody, and being able to have an open mind is not easy.
[02:12:45.471 --> 02:12:51.896]  You know, I find myself defending things that aren't always right, and I go, oh my gosh, I've got a closed mind on this thing.
[02:12:52.317 --> 02:12:53.718]  So it happens to everybody.
[02:12:53.878 --> 02:12:57.581]  Everybody's been in the dark, and yet everybody is wakening up right now.
[02:12:58.141 --> 02:12:58.481]  Absolutely.
[02:12:58.501 --> 02:12:58.942]  Anything else?
[02:13:00.143 --> 02:13:01.684]  No, no, that was fine.
[02:13:03.966 --> 02:13:05.147]  Well, thank you so much, sir.
[02:13:05.167 --> 02:13:06.087]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:06.848 --> 02:13:08.949]  Will in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with George Humphrey.
[02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:11.752]  Hey guys, great show.
[02:13:11.832 --> 02:13:12.752]  Big fan, George.
[02:13:13.826 --> 02:13:15.748]  I just wanted to call in to tell you guys.
[02:13:16.969 --> 02:13:19.851]  I feel the power emanating.
[02:13:20.592 --> 02:13:22.153]  I think you should do this more often.
[02:13:22.654 --> 02:13:25.656]  It's like your yin and your yang.
[02:13:25.676 --> 02:13:26.797]  Well it's funny you say that.
[02:13:26.837 --> 02:13:28.519]  I was going to invite George in again next week.
[02:13:29.580 --> 02:13:31.442]  I think you should do it on a regular Alex.
[02:13:31.542 --> 02:13:33.103]  It's so freaking powerful.
[02:13:33.163 --> 02:13:33.563]  I can't.
[02:13:34.224 --> 02:13:36.686]  And earlier with Nemo was good too.
[02:13:36.706 --> 02:13:38.728]  I think you should do this on a regular.
[02:13:40.335 --> 02:13:42.497]  I want to call you during the week about something.
[02:13:42.537 --> 02:13:43.898]  Maybe I'll give you a heads up on it.
[02:13:44.198 --> 02:13:48.021]  I'm really disturbed a bit about your interview with John DeCamp.
[02:13:48.482 --> 02:13:53.326]  You got Monsignor Robert Huff is missing from the transcript as well.
[02:13:53.746 --> 02:13:58.350]  And this gives the Jesuit people... I don't think you're CIA for the record, Alex.
[02:13:58.976 --> 02:14:01.878]  But this gives them ammunition.
[02:14:02.679 --> 02:14:04.820]  My senior Robert Hupp was exerted.
[02:14:15.885 --> 02:14:18.106]  John DeCamp four or five times here on air.
[02:14:18.486 --> 02:14:28.369]  And there are people then that come and say horrible things about John DeCamp, who was a Republican investigator and member of the Senate in that state, whose private investigator's plane got blown up.
[02:14:28.769 --> 02:14:29.810]  He's been death-threatened.
[02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:33.471]  And then people viciously say horrible things about him for exposing this.
[02:14:34.251 --> 02:14:35.492]  And I have listeners.
[02:14:36.292 --> 02:14:38.074]  I don't have anyone here that makes transcripts.
[02:14:38.774 --> 02:14:45.360]  Listeners, and we've asked listeners to do this, make transcripts of the show and send them in to us.
[02:14:46.021 --> 02:14:56.390]  So I have no memory of cutting some on seniors out, but we do have great listeners who tend to be very intelligent.
[02:14:57.291 --> 02:15:02.573]  And, you know, maybe they, because I believe the report, wait, I don't even think his name was blacked out.
[02:15:03.073 --> 02:15:05.874]  I don't think DeKalb, I'm going from memory on this, this was like six, seven years ago.
[02:15:06.314 --> 02:15:06.854]  Maybe longer.
[02:15:07.814 --> 02:15:08.814]  I'm going from memory on this.
[02:15:08.834 --> 02:15:15.636]  I don't even think he said his name on air, or maybe, you know, memory doesn't serve me on that.
[02:15:15.656 --> 02:15:19.857]  I've gotten some emails asking me about why'd you cut that out, and I haven't had time to investigate it.
[02:15:20.198 --> 02:15:21.278]  I just know I didn't do it.
[02:15:21.818 --> 02:15:23.500]  I mean, you know, we have a lot of paranoid listeners, too.
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:27.463]  They think because the Internet's like a minute delayed, that we're delaying things live on air.
[02:15:27.804 --> 02:15:33.028]  You know, the radio stations I work out of, like KLBJ has a ten-second delay there.
[02:15:33.749 --> 02:15:41.636]  Folks, notice how it's almost like a mental illness, that we're here talking about waking up, getting people to wake up, standing up for liberty and love, and we have power.
[02:15:41.917 --> 02:15:43.358]  That is not what the New World Order tells you.
[02:15:43.538 --> 02:15:47.182]  They tell you, you don't have power, there's nothing you can do, Al-Qaeda's going to get you, be afraid.
[02:15:48.022 --> 02:16:01.768]  And, you know, I get it saying I'm coming up for Zionists when I have George in here, and I have Tex Mars in here, and I have Robert Galen Ross in here, and I have all these other guests, Darja Maul exposing Israel, and I make films about it.
[02:16:02.168 --> 02:16:03.109]  I mean, I'm just not...
[02:16:04.164 --> 02:16:05.825]  I'd probably go overboard bashing Mexico.
[02:16:05.865 --> 02:16:06.986]  It's not a racial thing there either.
[02:16:07.026 --> 02:16:08.487]  They're just trying to invade the country.
[02:16:08.507 --> 02:16:09.287]  The government's letting them.
[02:16:10.108 --> 02:16:13.610]  So I try to be balanced and, you know, bring everybody together here.
[02:16:14.070 --> 02:16:17.512]  And it really becomes a constant distraction, like the gossip.
[02:16:17.953 --> 02:16:21.535]  You know, like there's football teams fighting with each other in the Patriot movement.
[02:16:21.575 --> 02:16:23.576]  Folks, they're poisoning your water, your air.
[02:16:23.596 --> 02:16:26.798]  I don't even know how to explain it to people.
[02:16:27.178 --> 02:16:28.539]  It just drives me up the wall.
[02:16:28.879 --> 02:16:31.121]  Not that I'm being attacked over weird crap.
[02:16:31.761 --> 02:16:35.122]  Absolutely, and getting exact and correct information is essential.
[02:16:53.675 --> 02:17:00.498]  We don't always get everything all right, but I think the most important thing is to look into the heart of the person who's putting it out there.
[02:17:01.078 --> 02:17:03.039]  And I've known you since you were 20 years old!
[02:17:04.747 --> 02:17:09.211]  And you're giving it your very, very best effort to wake people up.
[02:17:09.231 --> 02:17:09.671]  That's the other thing.
[02:17:09.691 --> 02:17:11.133]  New World Order people don't work this hard.
[02:17:11.293 --> 02:17:12.534]  Yeah.
[02:17:12.854 --> 02:17:16.838]  They go to the club and they make a lot of... They're into lives of leisure.
[02:17:16.878 --> 02:17:18.759]  They're into not caring about anybody but themselves.
[02:17:18.859 --> 02:17:19.920]  I'm the opposite, folks.
[02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.084]  And the point is, is there's so many... They have no discernment if they don't know I'm for real.
[02:17:24.244 --> 02:17:51.947]  There are so many good people who are awake and alive to this fire of sharing the information and the truth about the Fed and about the dark areas, but there are also getting to be more and more people talking about the Second Awakening, of awakening to our reality of our God-centered universal reality of light and love and the universal laws
[02:17:52.467 --> 02:17:55.728]  Of attraction, of co-creation, and allowance.
[02:17:56.128 --> 02:18:02.470]  And when we become aware of those, the law of attraction, we become as powerful as we can be.
[02:18:02.510 --> 02:18:05.190]  Exactly, and I've said this to the New World Order, who I know has millions listening.
[02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:07.751]  They're putting poison in your water and your shots.
[02:18:07.811 --> 02:18:10.192]  You're with us, whether you know it or not.
[02:18:10.372 --> 02:18:13.012]  The globalists are good at making people think they're part of their structure.
[02:18:13.573 --> 02:18:14.033]  They're not.
[02:18:14.493 --> 02:18:15.893]  I want to defeat the New World Order.
[02:18:16.013 --> 02:18:16.793]  I want to stop them.
[02:18:16.893 --> 02:18:17.594]  I want to live.
[02:18:17.934 --> 02:18:19.014]  I want to help others live.
[02:18:19.514 --> 02:18:29.617]  And it's such a great insult to claim that we are, you know, here doing something or here, you know, holding something back or whatever.
[02:18:29.817 --> 02:18:31.117]  Hey, we tell you investigate.
[02:18:31.418 --> 02:18:33.018]  We're just telling you look into things.
[02:18:33.338 --> 02:18:34.258]  Don't trust the government.
[02:18:34.639 --> 02:18:36.839]  That is the opposite of what the government says, George.
[02:18:37.739 --> 02:18:46.362]  Well, you know, I guarantee if you listen to Alex for one week, which I'd say that 95% of the people have done, is that, you know, even though he
[02:18:46.462 --> 02:18:50.565]  He yells a lot, he screams a lot, and I'm always telling him, chill out a little bit.
[02:18:50.645 --> 02:18:57.051]  I get around him too, and I start yelling and screaming because the passion is so real, the energy is so real.
[02:18:57.511 --> 02:18:59.052]  And that makes me feel alive.
[02:18:59.092 --> 02:19:04.417]  You know, at one point I'd like to be down at Barton Creek right now having a good time, but you know what?
[02:19:04.537 --> 02:19:10.341]  I would rather be sitting here with you talking about this stuff and sharing this than anything in the world.
[02:19:10.361 --> 02:19:12.223]  Speaking of that, how are your children doing?
[02:19:12.443 --> 02:19:13.304]  Oh, they're doing absolutely.
[02:19:13.364 --> 02:19:17.027]  My son is at the University of Arizona in Tucson, which is a great place.
[02:19:17.168 --> 02:19:24.034]  My daughter is a junior at Austin High, and she just won the district championship doubles tennis tournament, and I'm a proud dad.
[02:19:25.342 --> 02:19:32.806]  Man, I tell you, I think that's why we're going to win, because we're going to ask the FBI, the police, the globalists, their minions, look at your children.
[02:19:32.866 --> 02:19:34.166]  You know this system's bad.
[02:19:34.707 --> 02:19:35.887]  You know it's destructive.
[02:19:35.987 --> 02:19:37.168]  You know we're the good guys.
[02:19:37.208 --> 02:19:38.348]  You know John Yoo's bad.
[02:19:38.368 --> 02:19:39.509]  You know Rockefeller's bad.
[02:19:39.789 --> 02:19:40.990]  You know Rothschild's bad.
[02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:43.311]  And you know killing Iraqi children's bad.
[02:19:43.831 --> 02:19:46.072]  And we just don't need to go down this road.
[02:19:46.152 --> 02:19:48.093]  And they've got to breathe the same air as we do.
[02:19:48.133 --> 02:19:53.514]  You know, the people who say no to chemtrails say, all you've got to do is look up.
[02:19:53.634 --> 02:19:59.356]  And the number of people who had chemtrail-related illnesses last month was extremely high.
[02:19:59.936 --> 02:20:06.117]  And if you can just get people to look up and explain to them, it will break through.
[02:20:06.157 --> 02:20:10.399]  And if you can explain to them about the Federal Reserve, they will understand.
[02:20:10.439 --> 02:20:15.280]  And if you can explain to them about how the government, the Plunge Protection Team,
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:17.781]  There are so many things that we can do.
[02:20:17.821 --> 02:20:22.344]  There are so many different ways, because basically all human beings are good.
[02:20:22.724 --> 02:20:24.085]  I truly, truly believe that.
[02:20:24.465 --> 02:20:30.009]  And we have to have the discernment to be able to see in the ways that we can speak to our brothers and sisters.
[02:20:30.029 --> 02:20:32.250]  Well, I think there are psychopaths, though, that have been totally turned over to evil.
[02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.730]  Absolutely.
[02:20:33.071 --> 02:20:44.698]  Well, you know, they're evil, and that's a very relative term, but I would say that 90% plus of the people that we talk to is that there's some way into their hearts and their minds.
[02:20:45.678 --> 02:21:01.973]  And you know, you've just got to have patience and just like Jesus said, don't cast pearls before swine, don't waste your energy on people who won't listen to you, but have the discernment and with the law of attraction, if you put out the light, if you put out the love, if you put out the information,
[02:21:02.273 --> 02:21:11.339]  You're going to attract wonderful people and creating community, whether it's here in Austin, Texas, or in Boise, Idaho, or in Los Angeles, or in New York City.
[02:21:11.799 --> 02:21:22.046]  Create a group once a week in which you all come together and bring some food, and you say some prayers, and you sing a little bit, and then you talk about environmental, metaphysical, economic issues.
[02:21:22.066 --> 02:21:22.787]  And here's the key.
[02:21:22.847 --> 02:21:25.368]  If there's millions of groups, they can't infiltrate them all.
[02:21:25.529 --> 02:21:26.029]  Absolutely.
[02:21:26.049 --> 02:21:26.309]  They can't.
[02:21:26.349 --> 02:21:27.550]  People stop getting paranoid.
[02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:30.412]  The helicopter flies over your house because you had a meeting with ten people.
[02:21:30.432 --> 02:21:32.093]  I mean, let me tell you what the feds do.
[02:21:32.553 --> 02:21:33.834]  They go to militia meetings.
[02:21:33.874 --> 02:21:34.875]  I'm not saying militias are bad.
[02:21:34.895 --> 02:21:36.335]  I'm saying this is what's happened over and over again.
[02:21:36.576 --> 02:21:39.898]  Everybody hides out in camo, which sticks out in the middle of the city like a sore thumb.
[02:21:40.198 --> 02:21:41.458]  Everyone thinks they're being watched.
[02:21:41.498 --> 02:21:42.659]  Everyone acts paranoid.
[02:21:42.939 --> 02:21:44.800]  And it's always the guy saying, you can trust me.
[02:21:45.081 --> 02:21:46.141]  Don't talk to anybody else.
[02:21:46.201 --> 02:21:46.722]  He's a Fed.
[02:21:46.762 --> 02:21:47.322]  They're a Fed.
[02:21:47.622 --> 02:21:48.923]  Now, let's make pipe bombs.
[02:21:49.483 --> 02:21:51.404]  We've seen these court cases a thousand times.
[02:21:51.845 --> 02:21:52.605]  That's what they do.
[02:21:52.665 --> 02:21:53.646]  It's about paranoia.
[02:21:53.686 --> 02:21:54.206]  It's about fear.
[02:21:54.766 --> 02:21:58.107]  I'm saying wear a sports jacket, go to the city council meeting.
[02:21:58.488 --> 02:22:00.628]  I'm saying get involved, engage people.
[02:22:00.888 --> 02:22:01.829]  We're the mainstream.
[02:22:01.869 --> 02:22:04.810]  Don't act like we're secret agents hiding under a rock.
[02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:06.310]  That's what the enemy does.
[02:22:06.370 --> 02:22:07.791]  We're not the creeping things.
[02:22:08.251 --> 02:22:09.351]  We're right out in the open.
[02:22:09.391 --> 02:22:10.712]  Wear your urban camo.
[02:22:11.272 --> 02:22:13.294]  Yeah, speak your truth!
[02:22:13.954 --> 02:22:25.945]  We have no reason in the world to be afraid of talking about 9-11, or about the coming economic tsunami, or about the corruption of the neocons, or about the Iraqi war.
[02:22:26.605 --> 02:22:28.686]  That momentum is on our side.
[02:22:28.986 --> 02:22:30.627]  Have faith right now!
[02:22:30.947 --> 02:22:35.309]  And I'll tell you what, when you do this stuff, it is so absolutely empowering.
[02:22:35.689 --> 02:22:49.295]  And I really want to come back to the fact that it is essential to create a group of people that you can meet with and communicate with and have gatherings with to talk about this stuff and realize that you're not alone, to share good food.
[02:22:50.135 --> 02:22:57.721]  We do it here in Austin, Texas, and I learn every single week there are so many brilliant, wonderful people who are contributing.
[02:22:57.921 --> 02:22:59.983]  And it's diverse discussions, it's not just one.
[02:23:00.343 --> 02:23:02.284]  It's all over the place.
[02:23:02.805 --> 02:23:08.989]  We have people who are professors at UT in music, and we have great music.
[02:23:09.370 --> 02:23:13.853]  We talk about the environment, we talk about economics, we talk about
[02:23:14.553 --> 02:23:17.114]  Understand, that doesn't mean you're for the carbon tax and global government.
[02:23:17.374 --> 02:23:19.555]  The enemy counterfeits everything that's real.
[02:23:19.675 --> 02:23:32.360]  Absolutely, and we have very, very precise and animated conversations about whether global warming is created by human beings, or whether it's solar flares, or whether there even is global warming.
[02:23:32.621 --> 02:23:37.783]  And the fact is, though, is that we have a safe forum in which people can express their ideas.
[02:23:37.803 --> 02:23:40.324]  Well, now the New World Order, with political correctness, says don't discuss
[02:23:41.144 --> 02:23:44.808]  And then they claim in the name of diversity, really it's in the name of not having diversity.
[02:23:44.828 --> 02:23:45.788]  Yeah.
[02:23:45.949 --> 02:23:53.275]  And when you realize that there are so many people who are interested in this stuff, it is just amazing.
[02:23:53.315 --> 02:24:02.584]  We have doctors, we have chiropractors, we have lawyers, we have Indian chiefs, we have school teachers, we have unemployed people, we have people from all
[02:24:02.984 --> 02:24:03.885]  And the elite is threatened by that!
[02:24:17.841 --> 02:24:18.722]  Absolutely they are.
[02:24:18.802 --> 02:24:19.422]  They are now.
[02:24:19.863 --> 02:24:20.843]  I think they went too far.
[02:24:20.883 --> 02:24:21.744]  People think they're invincible.
[02:24:21.764 --> 02:24:22.064]  They're not.
[02:24:22.084 --> 02:24:22.865]  They're not gods.
[02:24:23.506 --> 02:24:25.387]  And I think they know they've gone too far.
[02:24:25.407 --> 02:24:27.088]  So we're entering a very interesting time.
[02:24:27.108 --> 02:24:28.650]  In a minute or two we've got left, George Humphrey.
[02:24:29.450 --> 02:24:30.431]  Fearorlove.com.
[02:24:30.471 --> 02:24:31.812]  We also sell your video.
[02:24:32.673 --> 02:24:36.036]  And we also, about 9-11, we also carry several of your pamphlet books.
[02:24:36.496 --> 02:24:36.736]  That's right.
[02:24:56.408 --> 02:24:57.409]  I'm in it, obviously.
[02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:58.671]  I consulted on it.
[02:24:58.751 --> 02:25:01.194]  We have met the enemy and the enemy is our own government.
[02:25:01.574 --> 02:25:06.540]  People now know the government deals the drugs, or brings in the most of them, but they don't understand the full paradigm.
[02:25:06.881 --> 02:25:10.425]  This is a very important film and it's got three hours of extra, so it's five hours, $24.95.
[02:25:12.687 --> 02:25:14.609]  at Infowars.com.
[02:25:15.189 --> 02:25:18.612]  I want to encourage everybody to go there and get American Drug War.
[02:25:18.672 --> 02:25:19.432]  Call 888-253-3139.
[02:25:20.153 --> 02:25:36.345]  If you're not watching the video of this online at Infowars.com, you need to go to Infowars.com and to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15-cent-a-day membership to get the document cam, the two-camera shoot, all of what we do here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:25:36.606 --> 02:25:37.466]  George, thanks for coming in.
[02:25:37.586 --> 02:25:38.147]  I love you, buddy.
[02:25:38.857 --> 02:25:42.560]  Hey, it was fabulous having you, and I want to get you back up again in the next few weeks.
[02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:43.821]  The listeners really loved it.
[02:25:44.362 --> 02:25:45.723]  All right, folks, we're out of time.
[02:25:45.823 --> 02:25:49.426]  We'll now meet my show in retransmission at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:49.667 --> 02:25:50.047]  Take care.
[02:25:50.087 --> 02:25:51.608]  See you back tomorrow, live at 11 a.m.
[02:25:51.869 --> 02:25:52.629]  Central Standard Time.
[02:25:55.672 --> 02:25:56.453]  That was great, my friend.
[02:25:56.653 --> 02:25:57.153]  God bless you.
[02:25:57.494 --> 02:25:58.234]  Thanks for coming in.
[02:26:00.576 --> 02:26:03.018]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:26:03.759 --> 02:26:07.022]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great
