[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:11.691]  We're being told that as soon as John McCain or Barack Obama are elected and inaugurated coming up in late January that Al Qaeda is going to test America and Europe with a terror attack or
[00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:38.833]  The government's going to stage more terror attacks, the shadow government, to give an excuse to the system to expand more wars, take more liberties and freedoms.
[00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:43.475]  We'll be talking about that, the economy, with Tex Mars, and a lot more.
[00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:52.198]  And Tex has also done some research, this is coming up at the end of the hour, on the Grand Poobah, the guy that says that
[00:00:53.658 --> 00:00:59.520]  Basically, anybody and everybody in the Patriot Movement, except him, is an agent of the Vatican.
[00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.562]  Now, that's pretty funny, because you're, of course, a Protestant pastor.
[00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:07.743]  My family helped found Texas, the Ayers family, raised Colonel Travis's son.
[00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:15.506]  They brought in Bibles into Galveston and literally ran from the Jesuits who were trying to kill him up to Nacogdoches.
[00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:19.128]  And then into Central Texas after that.
[00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.691]  So that's really funny as well.
[00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:23.553]  But we're not going to name any names today.
[00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:25.715]  It's just, what's been discovered is very interesting.
[00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:29.519]  And of course it was obvious from the beginning, but it's become even more obvious.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.208]  So it's very important to understand that people want to undermine movements, and want to claim the people that are effectively exposing the New World Order, that we're all the agents.
[00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:40.830]  And notice we're never out doing that.
[00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.232]  And then nine times out of ten we find out those saying this about us, they are the agents.
[00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:48.773]  No one's saying that the Vatican isn't very corrupt and part of the New World Order.
[00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:53.235]  Texas has written books on that and even been criticized by Catholic publications for that.
[00:01:54.495 --> 00:01:54.976]  It's just that
[00:01:55.996 --> 00:02:05.781]  This is a great wedge issue to try to somehow energize evangelical Christians into attacking Christian leaders like Tex Mars and others.
[00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:07.442]  So it's just more infighting, more divide and conquer.
[00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:14.186]  We won't spend too much time on that, maybe 5-10 minutes, but it should be a very serious discovery that has been made.
[00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:18.068]  But I don't want this individual's name uttered on my show, because before I even knew who he was,
[00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:24.742]  He emailed me a bunch, like four or five years ago, and the first email I saw was, how dare you?
[00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:26.023]  You've refused my interviews.
[00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:28.024]  You're clearly a Vatican agent.
[00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:30.166]  If you don't interview me within one week, I will expose you.
[00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:33.148]  And I was like, well, I'm not going to do that.
[00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:39.892]  Though I would like you to expose the place of the Vatican in the whole New World Order with us today.
[00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:41.213]  We're not bashing Catholics, folks.
[00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:42.374]  This thing has taken over everything.
[00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:44.796]  But I think it's important to also show that.
[00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:47.398]  But then I learned this individual says I'm a white supremacist.
[00:02:48.638 --> 00:02:49.039]  Not about me.
[00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.559]  He says he's a white supremacist.
[00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.860]  He says that blacks should be put in their own country.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.024]  He says that Catholic priests do black magic rituals in aircraft and fire power beams down, that that's what nuclear bombs are.
[00:03:00.744 --> 00:03:03.365]  And he's clearly trying to discredit the whole movement.
[00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.507]  I mean, only a two-year-old would not see this, but I've ignored it.
[00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:12.850]  And then the people that are his followers, who are well-meaning idiots, I go, but do Catholic priests do black magic?
[00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.191]  I mean, is the earth on a string?
[00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:20.654]  He says the earth is on a string in the center of the universe, and that they drop nukes on ley lines with Masonic power beams.
[00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:22.935]  I mean, you can't make this up, so that's coming up.
[00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:28.536]  But instead of myself babbling text, we're going to skip this break for the internet audience, and be back for everybody else.
[00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:33.598]  Let's get into the economy first, and the election, and spend the lion's share of that.
[00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:36.678]  I don't like policing people, but this really is interesting.
[00:03:36.698 --> 00:03:41.339]  When they try to police us, and they're clearly not crackpots, they're clearly there to discredit everybody.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.741]  Oh yeah, well, talking about the individual, and by the way, there are a number of individuals seeking to discredit
[00:03:48.622 --> 00:03:58.689]  Everything from the 9-11 truth movement, to really what we are, which is the overall truth movement, exposing the global conspiracy of the elite.
[00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:08.957]  And of course, the CIA, the Israeli Mossad, have a tremendous amount of money they've put into these people.
[00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:11.999]  There are many disinformation agents out there.
[00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.301]  But you have to watch carefully what they're doing.
[00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:16.323]  Usually they go to the ridiculous.
[00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:22.636]  You know, and this is what they do to discredit the movement, because later you'll see them begin to be quoted.
[00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:26.564]  For example, the individual you're talking about went over to Israel,
[00:04:28.025 --> 00:04:46.977]  uh... and was on israel national radio so he was chosen you see and it turns out by the way he backblast anybody this person that you're talking about who supposedly has been exposing the vatican jesuits he will blast anyone who exposes zionism always wondered about that
[00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:54.822]  You know, it's one thing to expose the Catholic Church in the Vatican, but why does he defend the Zionists so hard?
[00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:56.164]  Hold on, Tex, we just went to break.
[00:04:56.184 --> 00:05:00.247]  John, I'm going to skip this break so Tex can continue, as I was saying.
[00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:01.608]  Okay, please continue, Tex.
[00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:13.957]  Well, this individual not only has supposedly written a book, although it's a very mysterious publisher that never published a book before or after, and he claims he's not related to this publisher.
[00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:15.138]  But he wrote this book
[00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:18.940]  And it is going to be the end-all book to expose the Jesuits.
[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:27.604]  Now, I've been busy exposing the Jesuits myself for about 20 years, and I'm more than willing to welcome anyone that does this.
[00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:30.045]  But I got his book, and it was absolutely ridiculous.
[00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:36.789]  I mean, the Jesuits have done everything from killing JFK, World War I, World War II, World War III.
[00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:39.170]  I mean, it's almost incredible.
[00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.931]  But the big thing about this individual,
[00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:48.218]  He goes from the Jesuits to start attacking anyone who says that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:05:48.278 --> 00:05:51.121]  Oh, they're Vatican Jesuit priests in hiding.
[00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:55.205]  Then he goes against, let's say, people like Constance Comby.
[00:05:55.765 --> 00:06:00.410]  Now, Comby wrote a book a long time ago exposing the New Age occult movement.
[00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.773]  He says Comby is a Vatican Jesuit.
[00:06:04.053 --> 00:06:05.675]  She's a Romish vixen.
[00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:11.076]  Yeah, you know, and which sort of made me laugh a little bit, Romesh Vixen.
[00:06:11.656 --> 00:06:18.357]  I think he took a picture of Connie about 40 years ago, you know, and he still thinks she looks like that.
[00:06:18.617 --> 00:06:20.538]  That shows the depth of his research.
[00:06:20.898 --> 00:06:26.779]  But now this man is knocking the 9-11 truth movement, and if you expose Zionism, he is really after you.
[00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:27.799]  Boy, you're the one.
[00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:33.840]  You must be secretly a Vatican Jesuit or you wouldn't be against Zionism.
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:43.484]  So, this is his game, and I've noticed as he has attacked you, as he has attacked Alfred Weber, you know, the guy that wants to have the 9-11 Tribunal to try Bush and Cheney.
[00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:48.346]  He's attacked him, called him a Vatican Jesuit, you know, covert agent.
[00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:52.548]  He's attacked me, of course, even though I probably have more
[00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:56.489]  Videos, more CDs in my ministry.
[00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:58.889]  You can go there and just look and type in the word Catholic or Vatican.
[00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:04.350]  I've probably done, you know, a dozen videos exposing the Vatican, but now I'm a Vatican agent.
[00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.271]  And it's very interesting, too, though.
[00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:09.532]  Well, that's because all evil can only flow from the Vatican.
[00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:11.192]  Well, yeah, that's his theory.
[00:07:11.212 --> 00:07:19.734]  But, of course, the Vatican does have the evil, and that's what I've been exposing, along with, by the way, the tele-evangelists and the others who are also
[00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:26.238]  I've been paid by the Illuminati elite, and I've done that too, so I've sort of looked at the whole range of false institutions.
[00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:27.959]  Yeah, they've taken it all over, basically.
[00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.220]  All the big institutions, but they don't want that.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.023]  But I mean, the craziest thing is saying that they do black magic rituals to make nuclear explosions.
[00:07:36.203 --> 00:07:43.668]  Well, what he does in his book and the radio programs, and he's been invited, unfortunately, onto a number of patriot radio programs.
[00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:48.483]  And they're looking for the truth, so this man seems to have some truth, you see.
[00:07:48.943 --> 00:07:54.624]  But then, after he's gained a little notoriety, then he starts attacking, oh, everyone who goes against... Hold on, hold on.
[00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:55.745]  We're going back to the full audience.
[00:07:55.765 --> 00:07:56.525]  We're going back to the full audience.
[00:07:56.565 --> 00:07:56.885]  Here we go.
[00:07:57.565 --> 00:08:00.946]  ...Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:01.926 --> 00:08:04.307]  Now again, folks, we're not even in fighting here.
[00:08:04.347 --> 00:08:07.528]  That means fighting people who are in the Patriot Movement or the Awakening Movement.
[00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.448]  And I wanted to get into this later, but Tex is just getting into it now, so we can.
[00:08:10.468 --> 00:08:12.489]  I also want to get into the economy and your take on the election.
[00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:23.912]  But there are people out there, and the kingpin of this literally says that nuclear weapons, and I challenge people to counter me on this, they won't.
[00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:26.014]  Because he's got quite a following.
[00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:29.958]  They do black magic rituals in Foo Fighter flying saucers.
[00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:31.299]  I'm not joking.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.105]  And that they drop these things on ley lines, and they can only drop nukes on ley lines, because that's where their black magic power works.
[00:08:38.996 --> 00:09:00.142]  Now, he also says the Earth is on some type of meridian, tropic of cancer, I don't know what that means, and it's on a string, and the Earth goes up and down on a string, and the universe orbits it, and I mean that's all, he can't believe that, I mean that's meant to discredit what he's saying, and then blacks need to all be sent to their own country, he says I'm a white supremacist,
[00:09:00.862 --> 00:09:07.010]  And then he goes and says, and we're Nazi Vatican agents who are working for the Nazis.
[00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.753]  And then again, neither one of us are Catholic.
[00:09:12.016 --> 00:09:14.579]  You actually married my wife, and I know you're a Protestant.
[00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:18.463]  You're also a retired Air Force officer and a space and aeronautics professor.
[00:09:19.284 --> 00:09:34.134]  And I just ignore this stuff, but then I did start noticing that the Israeli government and people have this guy on, and then you discovered that he's actually in the pay of some of the Israeli folks, and it kind of leads a double life.
[00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:37.256]  And that's really what I found, because I've tried to stay out of the whole Zionist thing.
[00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:38.897]  I've had guests on Like Yourself to cover it.
[00:09:38.937 --> 00:09:41.398]  I'm against what Israel does when they murder innocent people.
[00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:43.900]  I'm against some of the views there.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.082]  I'm against the infiltration of our government, the spying, all that stuff.
[00:09:47.162 --> 00:09:48.443]  And we've made fabled enemies about it.
[00:09:48.863 --> 00:09:54.910]  But just because I'm trying to cover the general New World Order stuff and not get in all the fighting, you know, I've been a little light on it.
[00:09:55.410 --> 00:10:00.076]  And I've tried to be more hardcore on it, but even before I got more serious on the issue, I was attacked.
[00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:00.876]  I mean, if you say
[00:10:02.116 --> 00:10:05.718]  The Israel attacked USS Liberty, which is now declassified and admitted.
[00:10:06.078 --> 00:10:06.899]  That is a lie?
[00:10:06.979 --> 00:10:07.999]  You are working for the Pope.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.561]  It doesn't matter if it's now admitted mainstream news.
[00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:15.103]  So I don't want to spend all day on this text, because you're a giant in this.
[00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:16.564]  20 years fighting the New World Order.
[00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:18.145]  I've been doing it for 13 years.
[00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:20.686]  And I know you've made some amazing discoveries.
[00:10:20.746 --> 00:10:23.307]  Others have as well about this individual.
[00:10:23.327 --> 00:10:25.909]  But that's what I told people privately about it.
[00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:31.072]  I just said, look, that's some kind of way to get to sick
[00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:38.111]  Protestants who've been conditioned, you know, through the churches to worship Israel instead of Christ.
[00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:39.092]  That's a new religion.
[00:10:39.132 --> 00:10:39.532]  Absolutely.
[00:10:39.552 --> 00:10:42.954]  And Pastor Hagee now is saying Jesus isn't even the Messiah.
[00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:43.954]  And people say, yes, he's not.
[00:10:43.974 --> 00:10:46.516]  You know, Israel, the real Messiah is about to come to Israel.
[00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:48.717]  The Bible says the fake Messiah is going to come to Israel.
[00:10:48.737 --> 00:10:50.358]  But the point is, this is classic stuff.
[00:10:50.718 --> 00:10:52.119]  And so I've just pulled back from it.
[00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:56.801]  But I keep expecting people to go, look, he says flying saucers drop nukes.
[00:10:57.201 --> 00:10:57.802]  But they don't.
[00:10:58.615 --> 00:11:01.216]  Well, they fasten on the Vatican Jesuits.
[00:11:01.596 --> 00:11:03.557]  And this is a very interesting subject.
[00:11:04.357 --> 00:11:13.501]  You know, twenty years ago I exposed the Vatican through the Order of the Jesuit infiltration of Washington, D.C.
[00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:17.082]  And we can go all the way back to the founding of the United States and the Jesuits had a hand.
[00:11:17.442 --> 00:11:24.885]  So, you know, it's okay to expose all these very secret societies, the Knights of Malta, the Jesuits of the Vatican and everything.
[00:11:25.646 --> 00:11:28.549]  And I've been chief in doing that, and I welcome anyone else.
[00:11:28.569 --> 00:11:32.053]  There are many secret societies, as you know, from Freemasonry.
[00:11:32.073 --> 00:11:33.555]  But you judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:38.020]  You have been chief, exposing that, and then someone comes out and says, you're an agent.
[00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:41.304]  Well, yeah, but you have to ask yourself, why do they do that?
[00:11:41.624 --> 00:11:43.386]  Why did this individual,
[00:11:44.247 --> 00:11:48.951]  Why did he say Jeff Rents of Rents.com is a Vatican agent?
[00:11:49.311 --> 00:11:59.760]  Why does he say Constance Cumby, who has exposed occultism, why is she suddenly a Vatican, you know, co-agitor of the Jesuits?
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:10.408]  Why is Alfred Weber from Canada, who has been exposing Dick Cheney and Bush and the 9-11 movement, why is he suddenly a Vatican Jesuit?
[00:12:10.628 --> 00:12:12.189]  Why is Pastor Butch Paul,
[00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.391]  A wonderful pastor.
[00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:15.311]  A Baptist.
[00:12:15.351 --> 00:12:15.691]  Yeah.
[00:12:16.312 --> 00:12:19.053]  You know, who's been involved in exposing the New World Order.
[00:12:19.313 --> 00:12:31.479]  The guy was indicted, even, because he had the temerity to say, you know, people write this judge and tell him what he did, ABC, was wrong, and then they come down and get it.
[00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:33.520]  This guy is a very brave patriot.
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:33.960]  Now listen.
[00:12:34.521 --> 00:12:34.761]  Listen.
[00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:43.612]  I'm going to tell you, I've exposed many people in my time, but I appreciate the Patriot Movement, the people who listen to this program, Alex Jones.
[00:12:44.052 --> 00:12:47.436]  I appreciate what you've done, and I've known you from the very, very beginning.
[00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:49.699]  I know your father, a great Christian man.
[00:12:51.181 --> 00:12:52.162]  All this is nonsense.
[00:12:52.202 --> 00:12:54.142]  So I ask myself, who is this man?
[00:12:54.383 --> 00:13:01.746]  Now, I've done some investigation, but there is a website out there called ZionistChampions.com.
[00:13:02.246 --> 00:13:04.047]  ZionistChampions.com.
[00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:06.628]  And it has everything on this guy, in his own words.
[00:13:06.668 --> 00:13:07.929]  Here's what he... This man
[00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:17.155]  Who says, all I'm doing is exposing Alex Jones and Tex Morris and Alfred Weber and Constance Cumbie and Jeff Rents and Butch Paul.
[00:13:17.175 --> 00:13:18.456]  He's got a long list.
[00:13:18.876 --> 00:13:24.440]  Almost all the leaders of the 9-11 truth movement seem to be Vatican agents, which is, of course, ridiculous.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:33.666]  But I said, and also, he really seems to despise anyone who even mentions the Israeli Mossad or the Zionist connection.
[00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:38.349]  Why is he so favorable and ardent toward the Zionist movement?
[00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.007]  Well, it turns out that he's an Israeli diamond merchant!
[00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:44.479]  Okay?
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:56.870]  Has his own website in which he brags that he's looking for the very wealthy who want the finest diamonds and gems cut by Israeli diamond cutters in Tel Aviv.
[00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:03.555]  Then it turns out he's been to Israel back and forth, meeting with various unnamed people in Israel.
[00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:09.140]  And as it turns out, the guy was even invited on the Tamar Yonah talk show
[00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.773]  That interviews all the movers and shakers in Israel.
[00:14:12.954 --> 00:14:14.976]  This is Israel National Radio!
[00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:20.101]  I mean, this is run by the Zionists, and they invited this guy on.
[00:14:20.142 --> 00:14:21.643]  What was the subject of his message?
[00:14:21.964 --> 00:14:24.827]  Well, he's blasting the Catholic Jesuits.
[00:14:25.287 --> 00:14:27.049]  They're the evil people of this world.
[00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:28.991]  They want to destroy Israel, etc.
[00:14:29.312 --> 00:14:31.174]  They want to take over Jerusalem.
[00:14:31.814 --> 00:14:34.877]  And, of course, he doesn't believe in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[00:14:34.897 --> 00:14:37.499]  These conspiracy theorists, they're dangerous, too.
[00:14:37.819 --> 00:14:43.964]  And, by the way, the guy has gotten so popular, he was invited to the University of Oklahoma, the Hasidic Jewish group.
[00:14:44.524 --> 00:14:47.086]  They invited him there, also, to talk to them.
[00:14:47.427 --> 00:14:51.130]  So, the guy's got a great following, and, of course, he's an Israeli diamond trader.
[00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.411]  Now, here's another thing this guy... He doesn't talk about that on air, though.
[00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:54.632]  No, he doesn't let anybody know.
[00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:58.116]  You know, he says, you, you are an anti-Semite!
[00:14:58.416 --> 00:15:04.222]  But he doesn't tell anybody that he's an Israeli diamond merchant who brags about it on his own website.
[00:15:04.383 --> 00:15:05.524]  Now here's another dangerous thing.
[00:15:06.064 --> 00:15:09.808]  Some of these people try to get you to commit crimes.
[00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:11.789]  Go bomb something!
[00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:12.509]  Go do this!
[00:15:12.789 --> 00:15:13.349]  Go do that!
[00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.810]  Kill these people!
[00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.351]  Watch out for those folks.
[00:15:16.691 --> 00:15:17.031]  Watch out.
[00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.452]  Here's one of the things he's done.
[00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:22.414]  He's got three different websites, by the way, this particular agent.
[00:15:22.974 --> 00:15:29.958]  On one of them he brags and says, for 25 years I have not filled out my IRS tax forms.
[00:15:30.298 --> 00:15:31.299]  I do not pay taxes.
[00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:33.841]  Well, they've nailed you to the wall, gone after me, everybody.
[00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:35.402]  Yeah, but not him.
[00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:40.465]  He says, I have never asked for a social security number, and I never will.
[00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:53.074]  Okay, now he's sort of inviting everybody, do like I do, you see, don't pay taxes, don't even fill out your... And you notice when I get on there, I tell folks, be careful, you know, it's criminal, it's illegal, but you know... Yeah, taxes, let's face it,
[00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:56.458]  Taxes are wasted, it makes us angry and all that stuff.
[00:15:56.898 --> 00:16:00.222]  But you've got to be very careful because the IRS is just waiting.
[00:16:00.242 --> 00:16:04.527]  The point is, I tell people it is fraudulent, it is a scam, but you make your own decisions.
[00:16:05.027 --> 00:16:07.670]  Yeah, and so he approaches it, I'm a Christian like you.
[00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:10.072]  I haven't paid taxes in 25 years.
[00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:11.553]  You don't need to pay taxes.
[00:16:11.953 --> 00:16:13.474]  I think he's inviting these people in.
[00:16:13.494 --> 00:16:14.794]  He gets a mailing list of these people.
[00:16:14.814 --> 00:16:25.460]  Well, I've noticed that whatever crowd it is, he'll come up and say, I'm a white nationalist, I'm a white supremacist, and then to another crowd he says, I'm this, I'm that, so it's different for every crowd.
[00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.662]  Yeah, he flies to Israel, goes on Israel National Radio, and blasts Christians.
[00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:30.662]  Okay?
[00:16:31.403 --> 00:16:33.504]  And that pleases the Jews and the Zionists over there.
[00:16:33.824 --> 00:16:36.786]  But he comes back to America and says, I'm a white supremacist.
[00:16:36.826 --> 00:16:37.586]  He actually said that.
[00:16:37.986 --> 00:16:40.828]  He says, I'm a racist, but I'm a good racist.
[00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:41.728]  Okay?
[00:16:42.068 --> 00:16:48.532]  And then he says, the black people are culturally, intellectually, and spiritually inferior.
[00:16:48.832 --> 00:16:51.714]  They shouldn't even be allowed to live in the white nation.
[00:16:52.134 --> 00:16:53.074]  We should force them over.
[00:16:53.134 --> 00:16:54.415]  They can have their own country.
[00:16:54.775 --> 00:16:55.416]  Push them out.
[00:16:55.856 --> 00:16:56.776]  Now, think about this.
[00:16:56.796 --> 00:16:59.338]  Here's a guy who's an Israeli diamond trader.
[00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:06.033]  Who's claiming to be a white, he says, I'm a white supremacist, I'm a racist, but a good racist.
[00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:07.814]  Well that's like the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:09.015]  I just want to put him in the wrong place.
[00:17:09.155 --> 00:17:12.797]  That's like Southern Poverty Law Center, and it came out in government documents, it's mainstream news now.
[00:17:13.137 --> 00:17:15.458]  It's been in a whole bunch of newspapers.
[00:17:15.658 --> 00:17:24.643]  The first one that broke it was Jesse Trinidad, the lawyer in the Salt Lake City Tribune, a couple years ago, that it turned out the Southern Poverty Law Center was running Elohim City.
[00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:39.689]  Yeah, what they do is they say, they bond many of these white supremacist groups, the Aryan nations and all the others, and then it turns out that they want them to go out and be crazy, to dress up like Hitler and wear little funny little mustaches and go, Sieg Heil!
[00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:44.432]  So that they can say, see, everyone who wants to expose 9-11 is just like that.
[00:17:44.472 --> 00:17:45.393]  They're all a bunch of Hitlers.
[00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:50.297]  They're Alex Jones, they're Vatican agents, they're Jesuits, they're anti-Semites.
[00:17:50.997 --> 00:17:54.018]  See, that's why... One man has all these things going at once.
[00:17:54.038 --> 00:17:58.458]  See, Tex, that's why I try to talk about North American Union, the Federal Reserve being private.
[00:17:58.818 --> 00:18:04.900]  I don't like coming on here and having to talk about how the illegal aliens have been brainwashed to hate America and want La Reconquista.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.860]  I know they're good people, so I try to stop the Planned Parenthood killing them.
[00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:17.042]  I don't like coming on here and bashing Catholics because the Pope's calling for a new world order, but I have to talk about it, but I'm not trying to make it a hate thing.
[00:18:17.422 --> 00:18:18.062]  And I don't like...
[00:18:18.802 --> 00:18:31.113]  And I know a lot of Jews in Israel hate what's happening, and it's diverse over there, but I know the Zionists are part of the New World Order and pushing it, so I have you want to talk about it, and then I get the, you know, the crowd that thinks Israel's the center of all evil and gets mad that I don't go far enough.
[00:18:31.414 --> 00:18:39.381]  The point is, is that I'm just trying to get everybody to work together against tyranny, and there are these people who are just completely out of control.
[00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:39.881]  Yes.
[00:18:40.262 --> 00:18:41.163]  Well, here's the whole thing.
[00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.243]  They won't.
[00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:44.226]  What you want is an America.
[00:18:44.586 --> 00:18:46.649]  You want to enforce immigration laws.
[00:18:47.069 --> 00:18:54.739]  And you know that they're going to use these Mexican illegal aliens and the ones from Central America against America, okay?
[00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:57.482]  And this is what we despise and what we fight against.
[00:18:58.163 --> 00:19:00.645]  But we don't oppose the individuals at all.
[00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:02.987]  You know, we're Christians.
[00:19:03.207 --> 00:19:05.028]  I believe whosoever will may come.
[00:19:05.348 --> 00:19:06.789]  That means anyone of any race.
[00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:09.891]  But listen, they want a black-white race war.
[00:19:10.512 --> 00:19:19.478]  They want the Mexicans to try this Reconquista and to kill white people and to set up this Aztlan empire of the South.
[00:19:19.498 --> 00:19:21.660]  And they talk about it, I'm supposed to act like it doesn't exist.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.261]  Yeah, but you've got to.
[00:19:23.301 --> 00:19:29.447]  You've got to expose this, because I'll tell you, many Mexicans, many black people, and white people are going to be victims.
[00:19:29.888 --> 00:19:35.433]  They want us to fight amongst ourselves while the Illuminati elite grab everything.
[00:19:35.513 --> 00:19:43.881]  And they control all the major groups, and their agents always want to make it only one group, so we don't see the entire attack pattern.
[00:19:44.222 --> 00:19:45.183]  Stay there, we've got a break.
[00:19:45.503 --> 00:19:47.164]  We're going to skip this one, too, for the internet audience.
[00:19:47.184 --> 00:19:51.865]  We'll be back with everybody else in four minutes with text, Mars, InfoWars.com is the website.
[00:19:51.885 --> 00:19:53.046]  We'll give you his websites as well.
[00:19:53.846 --> 00:19:57.708]  And text, I do want to get into the election, and what's happening with the economy.
[00:19:57.728 --> 00:19:59.468]  We've got so much on the agenda, Alex.
[00:19:59.488 --> 00:20:01.489]  And then this wicked devil right here.
[00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:02.609]  King Henry Paulson.
[00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.330]  I just messed up your notes here.
[00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.231]  Because I want you to be able to run through all this.
[00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:09.492]  But, I'm sorry for messing that up.
[00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:11.753]  But since we got into this early, go ahead and finish up with it.
[00:20:12.313 --> 00:20:14.455]  Well, I think we have to be very careful.
[00:20:15.496 --> 00:20:18.058]  We oppose illegal aliens coming to America.
[00:20:18.238 --> 00:20:20.079]  We oppose 40 or 50 million.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.263]  And that's really what it is, even though they say it's only 12 million.
[00:20:24.483 --> 00:20:26.184]  They kept that figure for years and years.
[00:20:26.605 --> 00:20:35.852]  But Bear Stearns, which may be one of the reasons they went out of business, actually did a report two years ago in which they said there were as many as 35 million illegals in America.
[00:20:35.872 --> 00:20:36.313]  Yeah, I know.
[00:20:36.353 --> 00:20:39.015]  The banking and brokerage numbers were 35 million three years ago.
[00:20:39.755 --> 00:20:42.938]  So, we want to keep America for Americans.
[00:20:42.958 --> 00:20:44.539]  There's nothing wrong with being America first.
[00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:49.343]  And by the way, if you live in Mexico... It's going to bankrupt all of the hospitals, all the city services.
[00:20:49.623 --> 00:20:50.524]  It's already happened!
[00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:51.285]  Absolutely.
[00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:54.287]  But see, if we made the revolution stay down there, they'd take their country back.
[00:20:54.808 --> 00:20:55.968]  We're being used as a steam valve.
[00:20:56.028 --> 00:20:57.410]  It hurts them, it hurts us.
[00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.091]  Well, I hope we won't go in too much this individual.
[00:21:00.111 --> 00:21:03.372]  He's only one of many disinformation agents.
[00:21:03.612 --> 00:21:05.072]  No, but one of the most effective.
[00:21:05.092 --> 00:21:10.754]  But, I mean, going back to what you just said about the illegal aliens, it hurts my heart, because it's the same thing.
[00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:17.536]  I don't like going on air and talking about how the Vatican's calling for world government, New World Order, because I know unsophisticated people who are Catholics will think I'm bashing them.
[00:21:17.896 --> 00:21:21.577]  I don't like coming on air and saying Pat Robertson said China's having to have abortion.
[00:21:22.017 --> 00:21:23.539]  I lost a couple of radio affiliates.
[00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:28.203]  He said it on CNN, and I said it's wrong for Pat Robertson to say abortion's good in China.
[00:21:28.443 --> 00:21:32.407]  Which he did, and those affiliates said, hey, we don't like you talking about Pat Robertson.
[00:21:32.447 --> 00:21:33.688]  Apologize, you're off the air.
[00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:34.869]  That was in Florida.
[00:21:35.209 --> 00:21:37.351]  And I said, I'm sorry, I can't be for abortion.
[00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:41.575]  So, you know, the point is, I have to bash the Protestant leaders who are controlled.
[00:21:42.016 --> 00:21:43.777]  I have to bash the Catholic leaders who are controlled.
[00:21:44.077 --> 00:21:45.939]  I have to bash the Jewish leaders who are controlled.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.721]  When I bash the British government is one of the top levels of this.
[00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:51.522]  I'm not bashing the British people.
[00:21:51.542 --> 00:21:52.222]  My name's Jones.
[00:21:52.262 --> 00:21:53.263]  Your name's Mars.
[00:21:53.303 --> 00:21:54.363]  You're Scottish.
[00:21:55.184 --> 00:21:56.564]  The point is, that's the key.
[00:21:56.584 --> 00:22:02.587]  They control through the roundtable groups, the governments and the major religions, and then they control it through that.
[00:22:02.647 --> 00:22:05.128]  You're giving them wide spectrum, the kingdom of the cults.
[00:22:05.148 --> 00:22:09.550]  You're showing them how it's happening, and that's what the agents never want that.
[00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.811]  They want to make it
[00:22:11.571 --> 00:22:13.051]  And that isn't just on the Catholic side.
[00:22:13.071 --> 00:22:18.433]  They want to make it just about Zionist, or just about, you know, and it's bigger than that.
[00:22:18.973 --> 00:22:27.695]  Alex, let's just look at the Council on Foreign Relations, which I believe is almost an aristocracy of the elite in the political and economic worlds.
[00:22:28.095 --> 00:22:33.677]  All the top CEOs, all the banking investment people, members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:22:34.137 --> 00:22:38.398]  Now, the CFR itself, and this was in their Foreign Affairs Journal that comes out,
[00:22:39.278 --> 00:22:43.221]  They have established a religious roundtable.
[00:22:43.521 --> 00:22:46.963]  You have to understand, this is political, economic, and spiritual.
[00:22:47.463 --> 00:22:51.686]  Now, guess who the head, the chairman of the religious roundtable is?
[00:22:52.066 --> 00:22:54.588]  None other than Henry Kissinger.
[00:22:54.828 --> 00:22:57.970]  Now, at the same time, Pope Benedict, believe it or not,
[00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:03.673]  has appointed Henry Kissinger as his political advisor.
[00:23:03.753 --> 00:23:07.575]  And Tony Blair has become Catholic, so he can be the future head of Europe, and that was admitted.
[00:23:07.615 --> 00:23:16.781]  And we said, if he's going to be the new EU chief in the future, he'll have to become Catholic, and he did that because they admit the EU is a, quote, Vatican political body.
[00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.502]  So it's definitely at the heart of it.
[00:23:18.742 --> 00:23:22.584]  You write books saying that, and you're a wicked devil.
[00:23:23.104 --> 00:23:24.025]  Well, yeah.
[00:23:24.225 --> 00:23:24.626]  But wait!
[00:23:25.206 --> 00:23:27.368]  Henry Kissinger doesn't stop with the Vatican.
[00:23:27.689 --> 00:23:28.530]  That's not enough.
[00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.973]  I mean, we have several hundred million Protestants in this world.
[00:23:32.073 --> 00:23:33.254]  I should say ex-Protestants.
[00:23:33.514 --> 00:23:34.976]  They don't even say they're Protestants now.
[00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:36.457]  They're evangelicals.
[00:23:36.657 --> 00:23:36.898]  Okay?
[00:23:36.918 --> 00:23:37.999]  Christian evangelicals.
[00:23:38.539 --> 00:23:43.641]  So, the Religious Roundtable of the CFR has to reach out to them, too, and bring them within its fold.
[00:23:43.901 --> 00:23:44.362]  Guess what?
[00:23:44.722 --> 00:23:56.167]  Rick Warren, okay, who has been called America's pastor, is now a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and is a member of Henry Kissinger's Religious Roundtable.
[00:23:56.427 --> 00:23:58.608]  So they don't care if you're a Protestant, even.
[00:23:58.628 --> 00:24:00.129]  Hold on, we're going back live to the full audience.
[00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.609]  Here we go.
[00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:09.235]  They've got several subgroups to control, Christian Republican groups.
[00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:12.559]  One of them is the Something Policy Center.
[00:24:12.579 --> 00:24:21.250]  You were just talking about the nexus points with Henry Kissinger, over the Catholic group, the Religious Roundtable group, over the Protestant group, how he's over all these groups together up at the top.
[00:24:22.813 --> 00:24:26.978]  What's the name of that big group that has a lot of the Christian conservative leaders and they meet in secret every year?
[00:24:27.178 --> 00:24:29.620]  Well, there's a Council on National Policy.
[00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:30.461]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:30.902 --> 00:24:31.382]  Absolutely.
[00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:35.247]  And that is weighted mostly to the Catholic side.
[00:24:36.388 --> 00:24:40.552]  You know, the head of Coors Brewing and all that, the beer company.
[00:24:40.933 --> 00:24:42.715]  All of those people are part of that group.
[00:24:42.735 --> 00:24:43.596]  James Dobson.
[00:24:44.236 --> 00:24:45.337]  It is also part of that.
[00:24:45.857 --> 00:24:50.779]  The old 700 Club, you know, its leaders, Fournier and others, were all Catholic.
[00:24:51.159 --> 00:24:53.780]  So a lot of those people are part of that group.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.041]  But what I was talking about now was the Council on Foreign Relations, the CFR.
[00:24:58.522 --> 00:24:59.662]  It has a religious roundtable.
[00:24:59.722 --> 00:25:03.163]  Yeah, people don't think of it as a spiritual organization.
[00:25:03.563 --> 00:25:10.986]  Now, you have to understand, they take everybody into their fold who's part of this global and anti-American conspiracy.
[00:25:11.326 --> 00:25:12.287]  They have taken LULAC.
[00:25:12.927 --> 00:25:13.948]  Okay, the Latin group.
[00:25:14.268 --> 00:25:15.409]  They have taken MALDEF.
[00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:24.514]  All of these anti-American, pro-illegal immigration movements, they are now members of the CFR, but they've gone beyond that.
[00:25:24.894 --> 00:25:36.461]  They have set up, and they had a big issue, special edition of Foreign Affairs, their journal, the CFR, and they said, we have established a religious roundtable.
[00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.551]  And listen to who are members of it.
[00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:41.373]  Catholic Cardinals, but wait!
[00:25:41.954 --> 00:25:51.944]  Also Rick Warren, okay, of Saddleback Community Church, who is supposedly a Christian Evangelical, you know, the guy that wrote the Purpose Driven Church that was number one on the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:25:52.404 --> 00:25:56.469]  They even said in the Foreign Affairs Journal that John Hagee
[00:25:57.518 --> 00:26:01.003]  And the pro-Israel movement needs to be brought into our fold.
[00:26:01.043 --> 00:26:03.105]  We need to bring all of these people in, too.
[00:26:03.366 --> 00:26:07.231]  You see, so this is not a Catholic-Protestant situation.
[00:26:07.831 --> 00:26:09.754]  They simply want to corrupt.
[00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:14.719]  Bankrupt the morality of all the Christian establishment.
[00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:15.740]  That's what they've done.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.900]  I want people to understand.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:23.942]  There is a Christian church, but it's not the televangelist, it's not the Vatican, and I call it the mom-and-pop church.
[00:26:24.362 --> 00:26:32.084]  I mean, many of them have to meet in their homes now, because the entire Christian establishment has been exposed as corrupt.
[00:26:32.265 --> 00:26:33.705]  This goes back a long time.
[00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:39.550]  Meanwhile, we have the movie W, making it all the evil George Bush did was because he was a Christian.
[00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:41.191]  He's born again.
[00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:42.412]  Can you speak to that?
[00:26:43.112 --> 00:26:50.098]  I mean, all the gay prostitutes, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, all the mean things Bush does, and then he's this loving idiot savant.
[00:26:50.138 --> 00:26:52.980]  He just did it all because evil Christians got control of him.
[00:26:53.361 --> 00:26:58.605]  Well, let's look at it from the Illuminati elite's standpoint in this election, and you'll see what's going on.
[00:26:59.832 --> 00:27:03.855]  McCain and Palin have the Christian evangelicals and all of the traditionals.
[00:27:04.435 --> 00:27:06.237]  And you say, oh, thank God for them.
[00:27:06.297 --> 00:27:07.557]  Thank God for Sarah Palin.
[00:27:07.577 --> 00:27:08.198]  But hold on.
[00:27:09.013 --> 00:27:12.716]  Now, on the other side, you've got the liberal groups.
[00:27:13.097 --> 00:27:19.322]  Maybe even all the way over to the Islamic secret agents of Obama and Biden.
[00:27:19.342 --> 00:27:20.724]  And of course, Biden is Catholic.
[00:27:21.084 --> 00:27:23.787]  So there you have the Catholic-Muslim factions.
[00:27:24.167 --> 00:27:29.091]  So they seem to be putting these two great forces at odds with each other.
[00:27:29.111 --> 00:27:29.792]  But watch out.
[00:27:30.032 --> 00:27:31.774]  Let me tell your audience about something.
[00:27:32.254 --> 00:27:32.535]  Okay?
[00:27:32.855 --> 00:27:41.625]  First of all, you have to understand that Sarah Palin was chosen by Zionist billionaires in Israel before McCain even knew her name!
[00:27:42.085 --> 00:27:43.227]  In fact, I can show you.
[00:27:43.287 --> 00:27:50.215]  We were talking about the Tamar Yonah Show, one of the most popular talk shows on Israel National Radio.
[00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:50.975]  Guess what?
[00:27:51.596 --> 00:27:57.139]  They had a two-hour special on Sarah Paulin right after she was made governor of Alaska.
[00:27:57.179 --> 00:28:04.163]  They said, we have a Zionist pro-Israel person as governor, and they forecast a great future for her.
[00:28:04.383 --> 00:28:09.566]  Now, there are 50 states in America, probably 49 of the governors are pro-Israel, right?
[00:28:09.586 --> 00:28:12.228]  Because it pays to be, because of the powerful Israeli lobby.
[00:28:12.608 --> 00:28:20.213]  Why did Israel National Radio, the Tamar Yonah Show, that interviews all the movers and shakers, why did they have a two-hour special
[00:28:22.072 --> 00:28:23.653]  Bringing Sarah Palin in.
[00:28:23.933 --> 00:28:29.915]  Sarah Palin herself said, I only have one flag in my office as governor of the state of Alaska.
[00:28:30.455 --> 00:28:32.316]  The flag of the nation of Israel!
[00:28:32.816 --> 00:28:41.539]  Why did she, when she had the debate with Palin, say, I love Israel, Joe Biden, and I'm glad to know that you support Israel.
[00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:45.761]  Why, when Charlie Gibson asked Sarah Palin, what will you and McCain
[00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:54.424]  In Washington, D.C., do if Israel starts basically, he didn't say the word, but World War III by invading Iran.
[00:28:54.804 --> 00:28:58.127]  She says, we would not second-guess our ally Israel.
[00:28:58.327 --> 00:29:00.389]  In other words, it's okay with us, whatever they do!
[00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:07.255]  Although it will bring America into World War III, it will probably mean gasoline at $25 a gallon
[00:29:09.717 --> 00:29:12.259]  And of course, the rich of the world would love that.
[00:29:12.439 --> 00:29:13.880]  They're going to buy those oil futures.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.902]  They drove it up one time to $147 a barrel.
[00:29:16.942 --> 00:29:19.183]  Now they love to see it at $300, $400, $500 a gallon.
[00:29:19.444 --> 00:29:23.666]  It'll mean 20 or 30 million Americans out of work.
[00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:24.867]  What do they care?
[00:29:25.027 --> 00:29:26.148]  We're peons anyway.
[00:29:26.448 --> 00:29:27.449]  Third world nation.
[00:29:27.849 --> 00:29:30.371]  And they will profit from our poverty.
[00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:34.013]  Wow, Tex Mars is fired up today.
[00:29:34.614 --> 00:29:36.415]  I tell you, stay there.
[00:29:36.435 --> 00:29:37.536]  We're going to take this break.
[00:29:37.916 --> 00:29:40.759]  We'll be back in three short minutes with Tex Mars.
[00:29:41.019 --> 00:29:42.740]  I want to talk some about your new book as well.
[00:29:43.701 --> 00:29:44.581]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.102 --> 00:29:46.683]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.624 --> 00:29:50.306]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:55.499]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:55.639 --> 00:30:00.802]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:30:01.002 --> 00:30:02.323]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:30:02.603 --> 00:30:10.768]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:11.008 --> 00:30:16.732]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:16.892 --> 00:30:18.693]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:20.894]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:20.914 --> 00:30:25.276]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:27.597]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:30:27.677 --> 00:30:35.420]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:30:53.072 --> 00:30:55.094]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:30:55.114 --> 00:30:57.637]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:30:57.657 --> 00:31:00.259]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.460]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.102]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:31:03.182 --> 00:31:06.005]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:31:06.025 --> 00:31:09.708]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[00:31:19.376 --> 00:31:24.147]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:31:24.247 --> 00:31:25.350]  An inside job.
[00:31:28.021 --> 00:31:29.082]  How dare you?
[00:31:29.522 --> 00:31:35.525]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:31:35.545 --> 00:31:37.966]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:31:38.006 --> 00:31:44.870]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rises.

[00:32:58.504 --> 00:33:02.226]  I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com and get Mysterious Monuments.
[00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:06.408]  I'm holding it up on TV, the size of the Austin phone book.
[00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:09.790]  And we're going to talk a little bit about this before he leaves us.
[00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.470]  It's part two.
[00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.312]  He did another book, Codex Magicka, part one.
[00:33:14.372 --> 00:33:15.233]  It's the same size.
[00:33:15.613 --> 00:33:20.856]  We carry both at InfoWars.com and some of his other books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:21.656 --> 00:33:23.977]  This will really wake people up, and he covers it all.
[00:33:24.337 --> 00:33:28.399]  He covers the corruption in every group and how they're all just factions in the New World Order.
[00:33:28.839 --> 00:33:35.602]  It's all available again at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:35.902 --> 00:33:43.625]  You can ask him about Mysterious Monuments, Codex Magicka, the other books and videos we carry from Tex Mars at 888-253-3139.
[00:33:43.685 --> 00:33:49.808]  Tex, you've got quite a stack of notes and information there, but just finishing up, I mean,
[00:33:51.468 --> 00:33:58.553]  To see the New World Order try to get me to join one faction or the other by pushing me into it's all this group or it's all that group.
[00:33:58.893 --> 00:34:04.997]  They really hate it when we expose and know that all these major groups are being controlled and show those nexus points.
[00:34:05.437 --> 00:34:07.759]  They cannot stand that and they want to sell the public
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.842]  I'm saying four or five New World Order guys are robbing the bank.
[00:34:13.102 --> 00:34:14.203]  Four or five major groups.
[00:34:14.243 --> 00:34:15.304]  You're saying the same thing.
[00:34:15.824 --> 00:34:20.307]  And they try to tell people, oh, they're giving aid and comfort to this group or that group.
[00:34:20.347 --> 00:34:27.332]  No, we're explaining that there's evil in high places all over the place, and they're all co-equally guilty in all of this.
[00:34:27.372 --> 00:34:35.457]  But I think this individual didn't make it public, this particular disinfo agent, that they were basically this officer of Israel.
[00:34:35.897 --> 00:34:38.079]  And so that's going to be, I think, a big problem for them.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.040]  Absolutely.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.683]  And listen, in Mysterious Monuments, I want to make it very plain here.
[00:34:45.364 --> 00:34:50.988]  If you want to see the broad range of this, let me tell the people a secret.
[00:34:51.008 --> 00:34:56.431]  If they haven't got this book, and they may have even missed it, it has 875 photos and over 600 pages here.
[00:34:56.831 --> 00:35:00.454]  But let me reveal something about the Illuminati elite.
[00:35:01.704 --> 00:35:08.170]  There are two things that are very important to them, believe it or not, and that is death and money.
[00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.412]  Not their death, but your death.
[00:35:10.832 --> 00:35:19.820]  They actually believe in blood sacrifice, and they believe it is a holy thing that gives them a great Luciferian energy power.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.641]  Now let me explain something to people.
[00:35:21.902 --> 00:35:23.303]  You say this is crazy text.
[00:35:23.623 --> 00:35:24.384]  Are you saying
[00:35:24.884 --> 00:35:35.070]  That people like Kissinger and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and all of these other, the richest people in the world, you're saying they're interested in blood sacrifice?
[00:35:35.211 --> 00:35:36.812]  Yes, let me go a little further.
[00:35:37.232 --> 00:35:39.033]  Go to New York City, alright?
[00:35:39.393 --> 00:35:41.795]  There are two buildings of interest that are pictured in this book.
[00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:46.397]  One is the Standard Oil Corporation building.
[00:35:46.877 --> 00:35:56.461]  It was built by John D. Rockefeller, who founded this incredible oil cartel that has now spiraled into Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and so forth.
[00:35:56.961 --> 00:36:05.404]  Now, with this vast power around the world, corporate and money power, this oil dictatorship almost.
[00:36:05.964 --> 00:36:07.185]  Now, think about this.
[00:36:08.514 --> 00:36:19.704]  It looks like a normal skyscraper, the standard oil building, but on top of it they have built, get this, a great Greek temple pyramid.
[00:36:20.405 --> 00:36:28.412]  It is exactly the recreation of the mausoleum, or the tomb, of King Mausolus of ancient Greece.
[00:36:29.013 --> 00:36:29.933]  What is the meaning of it?
[00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:42.281]  You see, the very word mausoleum comes from King Mausos, who built this fabulous pyramid-shaped tomb for he and his wife in ancient Greece.
[00:36:42.521 --> 00:36:43.722]  It's in ruins today.
[00:36:44.303 --> 00:36:53.411]  But Rockefeller believed that he had to build this tomb on top of his skyscraper standard oil building.
[00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:54.993]  But that's not all.
[00:36:56.076 --> 00:37:01.778]  Travel down the street to the Financial District, and there is another building, a huge skyscraper.
[00:37:02.398 --> 00:37:03.599]  It is a bank building.
[00:37:04.259 --> 00:37:11.841]  It is the Banker's Trust building that's owned by the Reichman family, one of the richest Illuminati dynasty families from out of Canada.
[00:37:12.161 --> 00:37:13.822]  But it's in the United States, in New York City.
[00:37:14.242 --> 00:37:16.903]  And guess what is on top of the Banker's Trust building?
[00:37:17.083 --> 00:37:17.923]  And I have a picture of it.
[00:37:18.323 --> 00:37:20.184]  The tomb of Mausolus!
[00:37:20.464 --> 00:37:21.585]  They built it there, too!
[00:37:21.845 --> 00:37:22.946]  But wait, I'm not finished!
[00:37:23.267 --> 00:37:39.882]  Let's go to the House of the Temple, the Scottish Rite, the largest Masonic group in the world, their headquarters, numerologically, according to a cult, you know, figurine, 13 blocks from the White House, and guess what the architect John Pope designed it as?
[00:37:40.714 --> 00:37:41.114]  Of course!
[00:37:41.355 --> 00:37:43.276]  The tomb of Mausolus!
[00:37:43.736 --> 00:37:44.157]  But wait!
[00:37:44.277 --> 00:37:45.057]  I'm not finished!
[00:37:45.238 --> 00:37:46.298]  The tomb of Mausolus!
[00:37:46.338 --> 00:37:47.259]  I have a picture of it!
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.120]  Okay?
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.941]  And they worship the devil inside of it!
[00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:51.162]  Now, but I'm not finished!
[00:37:51.602 --> 00:38:00.409]  Go to North Vietnam, and go to the... and say, I want to see where Ho Chi Minh, the great communist leader who kicked out the French and the Americans.
[00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:01.830]  I want to go to his tomb.
[00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:02.411]  Guess what?
[00:38:03.561 --> 00:38:07.902]  They've designed it as the Tomb of Mosles, but I'm not finished!
[00:38:08.362 --> 00:38:09.262]  I'm not finished!
[00:38:09.542 --> 00:38:10.622]  Let's go to Russia!
[00:38:11.002 --> 00:38:13.023]  You think Lenin was just a communist?
[00:38:13.423 --> 00:38:13.723]  No!
[00:38:14.123 --> 00:38:19.524]  He was a Marxist-Leninist Freemason, member of the Illuminati secret societies.
[00:38:20.004 --> 00:38:21.384]  That's why he believed in blood.
[00:38:21.704 --> 00:38:25.685]  That's why he believed in killing millions of people through his gulags.
[00:38:26.205 --> 00:38:32.606]  And what if you go and visit the great, you know, where his body lies in state, and they keep it with all kind of
[00:38:33.086 --> 00:38:38.854]  Fancy olive oils and all kinds of things to try to keep it, you know, still looking like him under glass.
[00:38:38.874 --> 00:38:41.778]  I mean, he's a pickled dead man, okay?
[00:38:41.958 --> 00:38:42.919]  At the Lennon Museum.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:43.961]  But guess what?
[00:38:44.241 --> 00:38:45.203]  You'll be surprised.
[00:38:46.471 --> 00:38:50.572]  It's the tomb of Mausolus, recreated!
[00:38:51.473 --> 00:38:52.873]  Now, why is this important?
[00:38:53.213 --> 00:39:10.059]  Why, then, did Obama, when he was given the nomination in his acceptance speech at Denver's Mile High Stadium, they rebuilt, or they built, I should say, set up the backdrop so that it appeared as a Grecian Greek
[00:39:11.372 --> 00:39:12.093]  A temple.
[00:39:12.793 --> 00:39:14.615]  New York Stock Exchange.
[00:39:15.276 --> 00:39:20.880]  What kind of building do you think that they run around in there cheating and plundering the people of America in?
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.521]  No, it's a temple.
[00:39:21.741 --> 00:39:29.327]  It's a Greek temple with a great goddess and devil pedophile men reaching down to grab children on each side of her!
[00:39:29.507 --> 00:39:30.468]  You think I'm kidding you?
[00:39:30.769 --> 00:39:34.572]  I'm telling you, that's the New York Stock Exchange building, a Greek temple.
[00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.193]  All in mysterious monuments.
[00:39:36.253 --> 00:39:42.475]  Tell them about the guy that built the stuff in Tennessee, and then there was these rumors about what was in the pyramid when they got into it.
[00:39:42.495 --> 00:39:43.136]  It really was there.
[00:39:43.336 --> 00:39:48.278]  Well, Isaac Tegrette was head of the, the founder, a multimillionaire of Hard Rock Cafes.
[00:39:48.858 --> 00:39:52.480]  Now, you know these t-shirts that run around the kids wear, and they have a great big sun sign.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.201]  They're just a big sun.
[00:39:54.402 --> 00:39:55.503]  This is Hard Rock Cafe.
[00:39:55.683 --> 00:39:58.646]  Because he worshipped the great sun god, or, I believe, Lucifer.
[00:39:59.207 --> 00:40:03.051]  Mr. Tegret went over to Egypt, and he bribed guards.
[00:40:03.092 --> 00:40:04.213]  This is by his own testimony.
[00:40:04.233 --> 00:40:07.477]  This was in the American Airlines in-flight magazine, by the way.
[00:40:07.497 --> 00:40:09.479]  They had a picture of him, and I show that in this book.
[00:40:10.217 --> 00:40:23.480]  He went to Egypt and he bribed the security guards to let him spend the night alone deep inside the bowels of the pyramid in the king's chamber, where the empty stone sarcophagus or coffin is.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.161]  He said that in the deep of night, deep inside the bowels... Oh, that's where Crowley did that too.
[00:40:28.341 --> 00:40:32.002]  Alistair Crowley, the great British Satanist, did the very same thing.
[00:40:32.262 --> 00:40:33.423]  The man who called himself the Beast, 666.
[00:40:34.763 --> 00:40:39.064]  So Isaac Tegret did this and he said at midnight a great light came to him.
[00:40:40.356 --> 00:40:40.676]  Okay?
[00:40:40.977 --> 00:40:42.298]  Now, I knew what this was.
[00:40:42.338 --> 00:40:47.221]  In the ancient mystery religions, they call this the Sun at Midnight.
[00:40:47.341 --> 00:40:48.122]  It's an occult ritual.
[00:40:48.142 --> 00:40:48.863]  Black sunshine.
[00:40:49.143 --> 00:40:49.363]  Yeah.
[00:40:49.743 --> 00:41:08.278]  And this great light came and illuminated the King's Chamber, and a voice told him, Isaac Tegret, you must go to the United States, to the city of Memphis, the sister city of Memphis in Egypt, and build a great American pyramid like this one.
[00:41:08.979 --> 00:41:09.359]  He did it!
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.620]  He went to Memphis!
[00:41:11.021 --> 00:41:20.869]  Hear this multi-millionaire win, and he teamed up with the head of the Denver basketball team, Sidney Schlenker, whose wife was arrested for drugs, and that's all another... cocaine and everything.
[00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.810]  That's another story.
[00:41:22.211 --> 00:41:27.896]  But they got together with the city fathers of Memphis, and they built the Great American Pyramid.
[00:41:28.723 --> 00:41:53.151]  Now, many people began this rumor, this gossip, these crazy people, these conspiracy theorists, said that at the very apex of that building, that Isaac Tigrett had placed a small steel box, a secret little box, about the size of a cigar box, and in it was something that would prove that that building was dedicated to the devil.
[00:41:53.971 --> 00:42:04.617]  Well, everybody laughed about it, even the mayor and the city council, but it got so bad, you know, because Memphis has a big history of voodoo and such there in Tennessee, that city of Memphis.
[00:42:05.017 --> 00:42:06.638]  They said, we've got to dispel the rumors.
[00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:19.045]  They took a huge crane in there, believe it or not, spent thousands of dollars, went all the way to the top, to the apex, and said, look for a box that supposedly welded to the girders right at the top of the pyramid.
[00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:20.105]  They found it.
[00:42:20.985 --> 00:42:22.126]  He had paid workmen.
[00:42:22.406 --> 00:42:23.346]  There was a box.
[00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:24.407]  They took it down.
[00:42:24.447 --> 00:42:27.708]  This was in the commercial appeal, the Memphis News.
[00:42:27.888 --> 00:42:28.808]  Yeah, you have that in the book.
[00:42:29.168 --> 00:42:29.748]  Absolutely.
[00:42:29.768 --> 00:42:36.891]  I have a picture of Tegret giving his Illuminati hand signs, secret hand signs by the way, hand signs, and as above so below.
[00:42:37.191 --> 00:42:38.191]  But listen to this.
[00:42:38.711 --> 00:42:45.134]  When the city fathers, with the cameras whirring, opened it up, they found a velvet pouch.
[00:42:46.054 --> 00:42:48.915]  And they opened it up and there was a crystal skull.
[00:42:50.123 --> 00:42:51.683]  A crystal skull!
[00:42:52.184 --> 00:42:53.904]  And there were some other artifacts in there, too.
[00:42:54.304 --> 00:42:57.525]  So, again, many buildings are dedicated to devils.
[00:42:57.865 --> 00:42:59.586]  Now, I want to tell people something.
[00:42:59.606 --> 00:43:00.806]  They won't believe this, but it's true.
[00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.167]  Underneath the U.S.
[00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:06.208]  Capitol building, and remember the great goddess of where?
[00:43:06.608 --> 00:43:06.928]  Greece!
[00:43:08.027 --> 00:43:09.688]  Stands atop it, okay?
[00:43:09.928 --> 00:43:23.512]  The great goddess of the ancients stands atop our capital, and she was placed there in 1860, because that is numerologically coded as 666 in the occult numerological calculations.
[00:43:23.952 --> 00:43:27.634]  But underneath the rotunda of the U.S.
[00:43:27.674 --> 00:43:29.794]  Capitol building, there is a crypt.
[00:43:31.155 --> 00:43:37.137]  And there is a wrought iron area and a recess, and there is a stone sarcophagus.
[00:43:38.274 --> 00:43:42.435]  Just like deep in the bowels of the pyramid, it's underneath.
[00:43:42.475 --> 00:43:50.877]  Well, by the way, I've had secular academics on from Canada or other places where they talk about the capital buildings there, but... Oh yeah, in Winnipeg?
[00:43:51.137 --> 00:43:52.178]  Unbelievable.
[00:43:52.238 --> 00:43:58.359]  I mean, in 666 calculations, it's got a sarcophagus, and they admit they shut it down and do rituals in there.
[00:43:58.899 --> 00:44:00.520]  Now, Obama figures into this.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.300]  You see, according to the Illuminati elite, they have two scenarios.
[00:44:03.481 --> 00:44:04.901]  Either one is workable.
[00:44:05.621 --> 00:44:08.803]  According to how they can rig the election, the voting machines and such.
[00:44:09.204 --> 00:44:11.885]  They have McCain and Palin on one side.
[00:44:12.706 --> 00:44:16.268]  And McCain will step down, if he becomes president, he will step down because of his illness.
[00:44:16.728 --> 00:44:19.851]  Palin will be the new Esther of Israel.
[00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:22.312]  There's some ramifications there we won't talk about now.
[00:44:22.752 --> 00:44:25.494]  But she has been chosen for that very purpose, okay?
[00:44:25.915 --> 00:44:30.317]  Now on the other side, if Obama and Biden get in, they have things working out there.
[00:44:30.538 --> 00:44:32.379]  You know Joe Biden, and you quoted him earlier,
[00:44:32.979 --> 00:44:39.041]  Joe Biden gave a speech yesterday in which he talked about this great event that is going to occur so much after Obama.
[00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:45.024]  By the way, just up on PrisonPlanet.com, just broken, Colin Powell warns of coming crisis we don't even know about yet.
[00:44:45.384 --> 00:44:53.787]  European Union head, British head, they say a huge attack is coming as soon as he gets inaugurated to test them and to test us.
[00:44:54.127 --> 00:44:57.589]  So, I mean, these guys, just like 9-11, they said get ready.
[00:44:57.809 --> 00:45:00.230]  That's why I went on air and said they'll probably attack the World Trade Center.
[00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.772]  I mean, not even hard to predict, they are getting us ready, Tex.
[00:45:04.272 --> 00:45:04.592]  They are.
[00:45:04.672 --> 00:45:09.695]  Now, Biden said, you know, not only are they going to attack, they're going to test Obama.
[00:45:10.135 --> 00:45:21.841]  But he said, for Obama, this task will be as if he is going to be forced or given the mission of cleaning out, now get this, the Aegean stables.
[00:45:22.701 --> 00:45:23.802]  What was that all about?
[00:45:24.282 --> 00:45:26.243]  The Aegean stables!
[00:45:26.523 --> 00:45:27.064]  Hercules!
[00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:27.864]  Hercules!
[00:45:27.924 --> 00:45:30.666]  He's going to be the new Hercules, the son of Zeus!
[00:45:30.906 --> 00:45:34.988]  That's the reason... And again, just like they call the bombing thing in Iraq, shock and awe.
[00:45:35.229 --> 00:45:37.090]  Shock and awe.
[00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.631]  I mean, explain that.
[00:45:39.651 --> 00:45:41.412]  I mean, they are obsessed with religion.
[00:45:41.612 --> 00:45:45.575]  And I notice all the New Agers and stuff, they'll claim they're atheists and attack me.
[00:45:47.455 --> 00:45:52.600]  And they always attack Christianity, but then you find out very soon that most of the atheist groups, they're openly a cultist!
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.581]  They don't even hide it!
[00:45:53.801 --> 00:45:57.165]  So they say, your stuff doesn't exist, but our God does!
[00:45:57.545 --> 00:45:58.666]  Well, think of communism.
[00:45:58.987 --> 00:46:01.889]  You think of them as the ultimate in atheism.
[00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:06.634]  And yet Marx's, Karl Marx's own, he's the father of it all, right?
[00:46:06.674 --> 00:46:10.098]  With his theology, his ideology of Marxism.
[00:46:10.898 --> 00:46:13.702]  In his books, Das Kapital and The Communist Manifesto.
[00:46:14.462 --> 00:46:29.299]  But Marx, his own housekeeper said, in his apartment, had a small room set aside, and had black candles, and would put one of these Jewish propylactic things around his head, and would worship the devil!
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.900]  He was a devil.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.901]  They have a god alright, but it's not our god, it's the devil!
[00:46:34.342 --> 00:46:40.844]  And this devil is tied to all of these ancient mystery religions of Greece, Rome, Babylon, and so forth.
[00:46:42.184 --> 00:46:44.225]  But I want people to understand this.
[00:46:44.865 --> 00:46:54.188]  The Aegean stables that Biden says Obama is going to be tested and have to clean out, this is from the labors, the twelve labors of Hercules.
[00:46:54.668 --> 00:46:58.370]  And one of them, he was so powerful he diverted the waters.
[00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:04.132]  And the great of this great river, and the waters came forth, and they cleaned out the stables.
[00:47:04.732 --> 00:47:10.714]  So the great waters, the dangers, and of course this all relates, I believe, to the Bible prophecy.
[00:47:10.774 --> 00:47:18.137]  And he's saying he's going to have carbon taxes, he's saying he's going to bring in regulating every facet of our lives, controlling us.
[00:47:18.257 --> 00:47:22.258]  I mean, people are thinking, oh, change, change, regardless of what happens.
[00:47:22.578 --> 00:47:25.619]  We're about to see, folks, all the craziness you've seen.
[00:47:25.899 --> 00:47:27.880]  This is nothing compared to what's going to happen now.
[00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.103]  I mean, from a secular perspective, it's bad enough.
[00:47:31.143 --> 00:47:33.005]  And these people are occultic nutcases.
[00:47:33.525 --> 00:47:34.366]  I mean, we're... Well, they are.
[00:47:34.586 --> 00:47:37.669]  You know, people out there may say, Alex, I'm not religious.
[00:47:37.769 --> 00:47:38.530]  I'm not spiritual.
[00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:41.633]  Why don't you just stick with politics and economics?
[00:47:42.073 --> 00:47:42.373]  Hey!
[00:47:42.974 --> 00:47:51.142]  Hey, it's not us that set up the religious roundtable with Henry Kissinger and Rick Warren, America's so-called pastor, number one New York Times bestseller.
[00:47:52.002 --> 00:47:59.489]  On the Bohemian Grove headquarters in San Francisco, it's guys in hoods carved in stone with a baby throwing it in a fire!
[00:47:59.709 --> 00:48:05.834]  Yeah, worshipping a great god, Moloch, who by the way, was the great god of credit and money!
[00:48:05.854 --> 00:48:08.136]  Back in the Canaanites.
[00:48:08.156 --> 00:48:08.796]  That was the big bull.
[00:48:09.717 --> 00:48:11.799]  And then occultists always have double and triple meanings.
[00:48:11.839 --> 00:48:16.463]  We know that it's not an owl, but they're calling it Moloch and saying it's an owl.
[00:48:16.483 --> 00:48:20.107]  You have to understand there's always a feminine and a masculine aspect.
[00:48:20.127 --> 00:48:26.713]  No, I know that, but then all the occultists get mad at me for talking about it, but being in the hidden, none of them ever attack me.
[00:48:27.293 --> 00:48:31.956]  on criticizing it, they make up lies and say I'm wrong and don't understand the occult.
[00:48:32.277 --> 00:48:48.748]  Just like I had the Bohemian Grove Action Network and other people get real mad at me for talking about, they were doing rituals there, they said, stick to the politics, and then we showed up and saw the local leaders with the witches pot, it's in order of death, doing their own spell with the state police guarding them.
[00:48:49.088 --> 00:48:52.150]  So they always say, I'll be an atheist, and then you show up and they're,
[00:48:55.472 --> 00:48:57.974]  Well, they're opposed to Christianity.
[00:48:58.154 --> 00:49:00.095]  And actually, they hate Islam.
[00:49:00.676 --> 00:49:01.976]  And let me go even one step further.
[00:49:02.297 --> 00:49:04.798]  They hate the Old Testament God of the Jews, too.
[00:49:05.259 --> 00:49:07.660]  So let's go to all the monotheistic religions.
[00:49:08.961 --> 00:49:11.623]  Let's be clear, the Jews were captured and brought into Babylon.
[00:49:11.663 --> 00:49:17.667]  That's where they got the Talmud and the Zohar and all those other books.
[00:49:18.047 --> 00:49:21.029]  Yeah, and even brought in the worship of Moloch and all of these false gods.
[00:49:21.269 --> 00:49:23.531]  And that's why Jesus... The Zohar, what's the other one?
[00:49:23.951 --> 00:49:26.472]  Well, there's the Zohar, which is the Book of Splendor.
[00:49:27.592 --> 00:49:30.613]  There's a number of Kabbalistic books.
[00:49:30.754 --> 00:49:33.074]  But that's all post-Old Testament.
[00:49:33.755 --> 00:49:34.635]  But they brought it together.
[00:49:34.715 --> 00:49:44.699]  Albert Pike, who wrote the classic Masonic textbook, Morals and Dogma, said that Jewish Kabbalism is the very foundation of Freemasonry.
[00:49:44.979 --> 00:49:49.140]  So all of these things, and the ancient mystery religions, they all come together.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:50.741]  You mentioned this nexus.
[00:49:51.101 --> 00:49:58.766]  There is a nexus, there is an intersection of evil in which all of these groups, political, economic and spiritual, come together.
[00:49:58.987 --> 00:50:00.608]  Now let's get back to this Obama.
[00:50:01.388 --> 00:50:04.751]  Is he going to be the great leader of Sparta?
[00:50:05.211 --> 00:50:06.992]  The great god of the Greeks?
[00:50:07.993 --> 00:50:18.861]  And is this the reason why, in Mysterious Monuments, I point out that the Greek, you know, I have Greek friends, I cannot... We have major newspapers now saying he's like Jesus.
[00:50:18.921 --> 00:50:20.622]  Biden's saying he's worshipping him.
[00:50:21.027 --> 00:50:25.489]  When he was in Berlin, he gave that great speech before hundreds of thousands of Berliners.
[00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:31.613]  They made sure the backdrop was the great phallic pole with the great goddess Victory.
[00:50:32.512 --> 00:50:33.433]  Okay, on top of it.
[00:50:34.313 --> 00:50:35.694]  So this is very symbolic.
[00:50:35.874 --> 00:50:36.975]  Everything is symbolic.
[00:50:37.836 --> 00:50:42.299]  And we have to keep in mind that these people are deep into symbology.
[00:50:42.379 --> 00:50:44.500]  And these things have meaning for them.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.742]  By the way, years ago you said Madonna was doing rituals on stage.
[00:50:47.782 --> 00:50:48.423]  They laughed at you.
[00:50:48.623 --> 00:50:51.024]  Now she admits it's been rituals for over a decade.
[00:50:51.224 --> 00:50:51.825]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:53.709 --> 00:50:57.992]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:50:58.232 --> 00:51:03.134]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:51:03.335 --> 00:51:04.675]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:04.835 --> 00:51:08.317]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:51:53.469 --> 00:51:59.856]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:00.216 --> 00:52:01.878]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:03.874]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:04.374 --> 00:52:04.895]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:05.195 --> 00:52:06.176]  This is his M.O.
[00:52:06.196 --> 00:52:07.496]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:07.537 --> 00:52:09.198]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:09.558 --> 00:52:16.303]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:16.703 --> 00:52:17.144]  Some U.S.
[00:52:17.184 --> 00:52:22.868]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:23.528 --> 00:52:27.011]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:27.031 --> 00:52:29.833]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:52:53.732 --> 00:52:58.135]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[00:52:58.615 --> 00:53:03.559]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[00:53:04.099 --> 00:53:05.920]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:08.462]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[00:53:09.082 --> 00:53:11.744]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[00:53:12.084 --> 00:53:13.585]  Know how to reach campus security.
[00:53:14.026 --> 00:53:17.148]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[00:53:17.568 --> 00:53:19.910]  And always carry a self-defense device.
[00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:23.032]  This important message is brought to you by Pepperspray.com.

[00:53:54.943 --> 00:53:59.046]  The elite loves telling us big stuff's coming in the future, big terror attacks.
[00:53:59.447 --> 00:54:02.529]  It's a message to all their cronies that it's an inside job.
[00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:05.832]  They love to throw it in our face right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:05.872 --> 00:54:06.572]  Very important article.
[00:54:06.612 --> 00:54:11.136]  Colin Powell warns of coming crisis we don't even know about because now the public will
[00:54:12.361 --> 00:54:16.344]  See Obama as somebody new, and then, oh, we've been hit again by terrorists.
[00:54:16.364 --> 00:54:18.545]  We've got to take even more freedoms and liberties.
[00:54:19.226 --> 00:54:20.166]  So incredible to see this.
[00:54:20.206 --> 00:54:25.109]  You were just showing me during the break one of the mausoleums of Mausolus.
[00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:29.472]  One of the largest banks in the world is taking a new path to intercept the future.
[00:54:30.193 --> 00:54:37.718]  And there it is from their own ad showing everyone, you were making a point about Greece when we went into the break.
[00:54:38.359 --> 00:54:39.159]  Think about this, though.
[00:54:39.399 --> 00:54:40.580]  Death and money.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:42.480]  Talk about a nexus.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.140]  Death and money.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:48.081]  So here is an actual tomb atop the Bankers Trust Building.
[00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:50.382]  Actually, it's a Greek temple atop that.
[00:54:51.022 --> 00:54:57.924]  You know, in the Bible, it's interesting, the book of Daniel says the last day's world kingdom, okay?
[00:54:58.024 --> 00:55:07.326]  The last day's new world order and its leader will come out of not Egypt, not even Israel, but Greece.
[00:55:08.166 --> 00:55:08.606]  That's sort of it.
[00:55:08.626 --> 00:55:20.832]  It doesn't say that he will be racially Greece, but the kingdom will have sort of a Grecian theme, the way Obama had the Grecian backdrop when he accepted... And all the Western monuments are like that.
[00:55:21.072 --> 00:55:23.013]  Yeah, so this Greek thing.
[00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:26.714]  One of the top occultists in the world is a man named Geoffrey Hodgson.
[00:55:27.095 --> 00:55:30.356]  He wrote a book called The Brotherhood of Angels and Men.
[00:55:30.696 --> 00:55:34.138]  He's talking about dark angels, of course, and how men should communicate with them.
[00:55:34.858 --> 00:55:40.519]  And his spirits, these demons, told him, we are Greece reincarnate.
[00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:43.000]  I think that's sort of an interesting thing.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:43.660]  But wait!
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:58.663]  The Zionists have brought back the mystery religions, because just as you well stated, even Jesus said, he noted that they came from Babylon, and the Babylonians and the Greeks and the Romans and the Egyptians all had basically the same religion.
[00:55:59.004 --> 00:56:00.584]  They worshipped the unholy trinity.
[00:56:03.686 --> 00:56:06.428]  Absolutely.
[00:56:06.709 --> 00:56:10.732]  And that's why Zeus is actually Neptune, or Poseidon.
[00:56:11.132 --> 00:56:17.257]  That's why the goddess is not only in her guise as the Statue of Liberty, but the Statue of Freedom atop
[00:56:17.957 --> 00:56:18.358]  The U.S.
[00:56:18.398 --> 00:56:19.098]  Capitol building.
[00:56:19.659 --> 00:56:23.301]  And she has been called the Goddess of a Thousand Names, by the way.
[00:56:23.582 --> 00:56:25.423]  So you see her statue everywhere.
[00:56:25.463 --> 00:56:27.965]  Mother Russia has a great goddess statue.
[00:56:28.225 --> 00:56:36.491]  There's a great goddess inside a rebuilt Greek temple to Athena called the Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee.
[00:56:36.852 --> 00:56:40.514]  And you'll remember that the Vanderbilt family had a lot to do with that.
[00:56:40.534 --> 00:56:42.556]  It's always the rich elites that build these temples.
[00:56:42.776 --> 00:56:43.096]  Absolutely.
[00:56:43.176 --> 00:56:44.156]  Oh, what a nice building!
[00:56:44.176 --> 00:56:44.997]  They're just everywhere.
[00:56:45.357 --> 00:56:48.277]  Well, Vanderbilt built the Grand Central Terminal.
[00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:49.418]  He was a railroad magnate.
[00:56:49.898 --> 00:56:54.959]  He built the Grand Central Terminal in New York City, which is a great Greek temple.
[00:56:55.599 --> 00:56:59.480]  And the great god Hermes is atop it.
[00:56:59.861 --> 00:57:00.981]  And by the way, he's holding
[00:57:02.221 --> 00:57:29.474]  He was also called Mercury, and he's holding the Caduceus, the two serpents, the yin and the yang, as above so below, with a phallic pole in his hand, and that stands this great statue of Hermes, or Mercury, this great god from the Roman-Egyptian pantheon of gods, stands atop the Grand Central Terminal Railroad Station, which has been made into sort of a museum now, in New York City, overlooking the great city
[00:57:30.503 --> 00:57:34.084]  Just as the Greek temple and the great goddess overlook Wall Street.
[00:57:34.444 --> 00:57:42.286]  So we have to understand that these mystery religions are tied in with the Illuminati elite, and everything has been set out.
[00:57:42.326 --> 00:57:43.186]  There is an agenda.
[00:57:43.446 --> 00:57:47.828]  Now this great event that's going to occur, I want people to understand something.
[00:57:48.368 --> 00:57:52.949]  Member Biden said, we're going to have to clean out the Aegean stables.
[00:57:53.749 --> 00:57:54.049]  Okay?
[00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:59.572]  It's one of the labors of Hercules, the great god who was the son of Zeus.
[00:58:00.112 --> 00:58:08.136]  Now, in front of the Rockefeller Center in New York City is a great statue of the son of Hercules.
[00:58:09.218 --> 00:58:09.618]  Zeus.
[00:58:10.139 --> 00:58:19.586]  And in stone on the wall of the Rockefeller Center, there in New York City, is a great image carved in stone of Zeus.
[00:58:20.346 --> 00:58:24.169]  And he's holding the Masonic compass in his hand, surveying the whole globe.
[00:58:24.729 --> 00:58:28.692]  So you find this Zeus, and you find his son... Stay there, Tex.
[00:58:28.712 --> 00:58:29.133]  Final segment.
[00:58:29.153 --> 00:58:31.675]  We're going to be back in one minute with Tex Mars.
[00:58:32.881 --> 00:58:34.742]  In fact, John, let's go ahead and skip this break.
[00:58:34.782 --> 00:58:38.082]  I want to talk just one minute with Tex, and we'll come back to the full audience in 70 seconds.
[00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:40.943]  Man, Tex, this went by too quick.
[00:58:41.323 --> 00:58:41.803]  Yeah, it did.
[00:58:42.704 --> 00:58:43.224]  But it was fun.
[00:58:43.344 --> 00:58:44.444]  Well, I can do this.
[00:58:44.504 --> 00:58:48.865]  I can hold you until 15 after, and then I just won't be able to walk you out.
[00:58:48.945 --> 00:58:49.726]  I can just say bye to you.
[00:58:49.746 --> 00:58:50.006]  Oh, sure.
[00:58:50.186 --> 00:58:51.146]  You want to do it that way?
[00:58:51.266 --> 00:58:51.726]  Let's do that.
[00:58:51.886 --> 00:58:53.647]  Okay, do me a favor, John.
[00:58:53.727 --> 00:58:58.688]  Call Webster Tarpley right now, and just say we're going to call him about 10 after, that we're behind.
[00:58:58.708 --> 00:59:00.589]  Will you do that for me, John?
[00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.469]  I sure will.
[00:59:02.537 --> 00:59:04.779]  Fantastic, because I want to let Tex finish up.
[00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:06.761]  He's got all these notes we haven't even gotten to.
[00:59:06.781 --> 00:59:11.325]  Maybe just rapid fire, go through those for everybody that is out there.
[00:59:11.945 --> 00:59:17.069]  You know, we need to talk about that great event that Colin Powell says is going to occur.
[00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.850]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:19.752]  Joe Biden says it's going to occur.
[00:59:20.372 --> 00:59:27.899]  Remember that Colin Powell, this weekend when he endorsed Obama for President, called him a transformational
[00:59:28.735 --> 00:59:29.755]  No, that's what they're all saying.
[00:59:30.415 --> 00:59:32.396]  We're going into the transformation.
[00:59:32.656 --> 00:59:37.257]  And they need to get the left and the Hispanics, blacks and others.
[00:59:39.117 --> 00:59:41.698]  He's seen worldwide as all the racist Americans have got a black guy.
[00:59:41.718 --> 00:59:44.378]  Again, it's just a front or a cover.
[00:59:44.938 --> 00:59:50.119]  And then they believe that he'll be able to get by with much more than an old white guy would be able to.
[00:59:50.819 --> 00:59:51.980]  I really think it's going to be Obama.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:52.900]  I may be proven wrong.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:53.480]  Here we go.
[01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:10.593]  We are now into our number four, Webster Tarpley, coming up in about 12-14 minutes from now, continuing with the election discussion.
[01:00:11.093 --> 01:00:19.599]  Whether you believe in this or not, we are secularly, Texans have to be Christians, but that doesn't, quote, taint our view, as some would say.
[01:00:19.919 --> 01:00:26.023]  We are just analytically, like anthropologists, studying, like we were studying, say, ancient China.
[01:00:26.403 --> 01:00:28.304]  You know, what did the Ming Dynasty worship?
[01:00:28.344 --> 01:00:31.246]  Well, they were these pantheists, or they were these animists.
[01:00:33.007 --> 01:00:34.368]  Well, they were Buddhists, or whatever they were.
[01:00:34.628 --> 01:00:39.010]  The point is, we are just reporting on the mindset of the elites.
[01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:41.732]  If you're tracking serial killers, you study what the serial killer's beliefs are.
[01:00:42.092 --> 01:00:44.893]  And if you're tracking somebody else, we're studying this.
[01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.054]  They are deep occultists.
[01:00:46.074 --> 01:00:47.114]  They are obsessed with it.
[01:00:47.515 --> 01:00:48.395]  It's all they do.
[01:00:48.515 --> 01:00:49.876]  It's all they spend time doing.
[01:00:50.736 --> 01:00:58.240]  This great event that Colin Powell and Joe Biden and the media and the British Prime Minister and the European leaders, they say, something huge is coming.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.141]  We know what it is, but we won't tell you.
[01:01:00.341 --> 01:01:01.482]  And the media says, oh, gee.
[01:01:03.122 --> 01:01:06.583]  Okay, we won't even ask what it is, because they all know how to be good little minions.
[01:01:06.903 --> 01:01:09.104]  Tex Mars, what is this big event, do you think?
[01:01:09.484 --> 01:01:14.245]  Well, we have to look at what Obama has been aiming for, okay?
[01:01:14.645 --> 01:01:17.125]  Now, Brzezinski is one of his handlers.
[01:01:17.605 --> 01:01:28.728]  Brzezinski, of course, was head of the National Security Council under Jimmy Carter, a member of the CFR, the trilateral... In fact, he co-founded the trilateral commission with Rockefeller.
[01:01:29.831 --> 01:01:32.093]  And he is a hater of Russia.
[01:01:32.694 --> 01:01:36.257]  Now, they have developed a new stable of enemies.
[01:01:36.677 --> 01:01:36.998]  Okay?
[01:01:37.578 --> 01:01:38.959]  These are the new enemies.
[01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:42.622]  You know, just like 1984, ever so often they have a new stable.
[01:01:42.923 --> 01:01:44.624]  We could talk about the Aegean Stables.
[01:01:44.924 --> 01:01:46.566]  Well, here's the new stable of enemies.
[01:01:46.866 --> 01:01:47.747]  It's Pakistan.
[01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:51.632]  Remember, this is an Islamic nation of 170 million people.
[01:01:52.092 --> 01:01:54.473]  This is the government that Israel, the U.S.
[01:01:54.493 --> 01:01:55.594]  and England gave nukes to?
[01:01:55.614 --> 01:01:56.394]  Oh, yes.
[01:01:56.535 --> 01:01:57.295]  Oh, and now?
[01:01:57.515 --> 01:01:58.336]  Oh, big problem.
[01:01:58.456 --> 01:02:03.799]  Well, the problem is that an Islamic nation has nukes.
[01:02:03.979 --> 01:02:14.865]  Now, Musharraf was basically kicked out, forced out, and now the husband of Benazir Bhutto, he's a very weak man, but he's a good man, he is the new president of Pakistan.
[01:02:15.385 --> 01:02:19.746]  But he is not pro-America or pro-Israel or pro-Illuminati.
[01:02:19.847 --> 01:02:20.187]  Enough!
[01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:20.787]  That's right.
[01:02:20.827 --> 01:02:26.389]  Now, Benazir Bhutto, the lady who was assassinated... They machine gunned her on TV and said she hit her head.
[01:02:26.489 --> 01:02:28.029]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.709 --> 01:02:30.130]  They should have just said Kennedy hit his head.
[01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:33.593]  She had gone on the David Frost Show just a couple of, several weeks ago.
[01:02:33.613 --> 01:02:34.954]  And said Bin Laden's been dead, it's all staged.
[01:02:34.974 --> 01:02:35.875]  Bin Laden is dead!
[01:02:36.095 --> 01:02:39.178]  Bin Laden is dead, the same people that killed him are now wanting to kill me.
[01:02:39.479 --> 01:02:44.503]  But Bin Laden is needed as, to be the boogeyman, as Ahmadinejad is needed.
[01:02:44.663 --> 01:02:45.885]  The excuse to go into Pakistan.
[01:02:45.905 --> 01:02:46.145]  That's right.
[01:02:46.765 --> 01:02:49.206]  Next year, Ahmadinejad is leaving office.
[01:02:49.647 --> 01:02:50.687]  He's very unpopular.
[01:02:50.707 --> 01:02:52.608]  And by the way, he is an elected leader.
[01:02:52.628 --> 01:02:53.569]  He's not a dictator.
[01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:56.230]  And it looks like he will be kicked out of office.
[01:02:56.590 --> 01:03:00.952]  But they need him, as well as Bin Laden, to be the two boogeymen of the world.
[01:03:01.332 --> 01:03:09.936]  So I believe that Pakistan and Russia and Iran are all going to figure in this great transformational event.
[01:03:10.137 --> 01:03:11.097]  And that's going to be war!
[01:03:11.117 --> 01:03:13.178]  Oh, it's going to be World War III.
[01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:14.599]  And by the way,
[01:03:15.399 --> 01:03:33.195]  What we're going to see... And by the way, we kept saying, they're going to attack Iraq, they're going to attack Iraq, and they said, oh shut up, you keep saying it's this month or next month, no we don't, we say they're gearing up, they've said they're going to do it, but I'm saying previously we said Iraq, and they ended up doing it, and they're gearing up, I mean they just snuck attack Russia through Georgia, so folks, this is serious.
[01:03:33.695 --> 01:03:38.018]  Well, the new Prime Minister of Israel has yet to take office.
[01:03:39.518 --> 01:03:41.139]  Zippy Livni, I think her name is.
[01:03:41.159 --> 01:03:43.661]  The Foreign Minister has been.
[01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.722]  She's a Likudnik all the way.
[01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.083]  She's for bomb, bomb, bomb Iran.
[01:03:48.103 --> 01:03:49.844]  You know, the Beach Boys.
[01:03:49.964 --> 01:03:52.866]  She could sing a little duet with McCain if he were in office.
[01:03:53.266 --> 01:03:55.387]  So she is a very deadly person.
[01:03:55.707 --> 01:04:00.609]  If she doesn't get it, of course, if Netanyahu somehow slides in there, he again is a Freemason.
[01:04:00.629 --> 01:04:06.952]  He has admitted, I was initiated into Freemasonry when he went to the University here in the United States.
[01:04:07.312 --> 01:04:18.457]  So we have these Likudniks who want to go to war right away, but more than that, we have the Kabbalistic Rabbis behind this, and they have a great agenda.
[01:04:18.977 --> 01:04:22.059]  Of the ages, to bring forth a new order of the ages.
[01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:27.543]  Remember the head rabbi said that Bush told him privately, don't worry Iran will be attacked.
[01:04:27.904 --> 01:04:34.328]  Yes, now they believe that the West, the leader of the West, is the head of Gog and Magog.
[01:04:35.169 --> 01:04:40.693]  Now this may sound strange, these names, Gog and Magog, but that's in the Bible in Ezekiel 38.
[01:04:41.153 --> 01:04:44.996]  They believe the role of the West, the role of the leaders of the West,
[01:04:46.572 --> 01:04:53.497]  is to attack in the Middle East to smash all the enemies of Israel, but in turn be smashed themselves.
[01:04:53.517 --> 01:04:54.958]  We're going to skip this break, too.
[01:04:55.098 --> 01:04:55.578]  Go ahead.
[01:04:55.598 --> 01:04:56.839]  I just have to skip breaks.
[01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.020]  We're going to have you continue.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:58.960]  You don't have headphones on.
[01:04:59.921 --> 01:05:00.862]  Did you talk to Tarpley?
[01:05:02.102 --> 01:05:02.362]  John?
[01:05:02.543 --> 01:05:03.823]  He's waiting in the wings.
[01:05:03.863 --> 01:05:05.505]  He's going to hold until you're done with him.
[01:05:05.525 --> 01:05:08.687]  Okay, we're going to come back to him in the next break for Webster.
[01:05:08.907 --> 01:05:10.188]  Okay, finish up with what you were saying.
[01:05:10.648 --> 01:05:13.930]  Well, we're going to see definitely a transformational event.
[01:05:14.568 --> 01:05:20.170]  And certainly Obama will be tested, but it'll all be a staged event, okay?
[01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:24.032]  Everything is in place now, all the pieces of the puzzle.
[01:05:24.792 --> 01:05:34.316]  It's like a great Broadway production, and they bring in this actor and that actor, and this backdrop and this backdrop, and the curtains are ready, and of course, you know, everything's set up to go.
[01:05:34.856 --> 01:05:38.977]  This is the deal with Obama, and it'll happen even if McCain and Palin get in.
[01:05:39.257 --> 01:05:41.078]  But I agree with you, it'll probably be Obama.
[01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:44.659]  Because he's younger, he's more capable, he's ready to go.
[01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:45.960]  He can sucker the public.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.521]  And Americans are always on a honeymoon with the new president.
[01:05:50.941 --> 01:05:52.202]  They give him a certain amount of time.
[01:05:52.342 --> 01:05:54.002]  And McCain's kind of seen as a Bush 3.
[01:05:54.522 --> 01:05:56.123]  Yeah, McCain is a Bush 3.
[01:05:56.943 --> 01:05:58.023]  This guy's more vigorous.
[01:05:58.164 --> 01:05:59.484]  He is ready to go.
[01:06:00.633 --> 01:06:14.444]  And so when this transformational event that will catapult him into becoming a transformational president, this great event occurs, it will literally be something so amazing, it will make 9-11 look puny.
[01:06:14.484 --> 01:06:15.925]  Well, they're saying it's going to be nukes.
[01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:17.967]  That's an AFP today.
[01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:19.828]  They're saying we're going to get hit by nukes.
[01:06:19.848 --> 01:06:21.149]  I don't know if that's the case.
[01:06:21.489 --> 01:06:27.214]  If they blame it on Hezbollah or the Al-Qaeda and say that Iran and Syria masterminded it,
[01:06:28.475 --> 01:06:38.802]  It will be discovered by the intelligence agencies that Putin and Russia, and somehow the ISI, the intelligence agency of Pakistan, were involved.
[01:06:39.182 --> 01:06:42.465]  These are the new enemies of the new world order.
[01:06:42.925 --> 01:06:43.606]  But guess what?
[01:06:43.686 --> 01:06:44.466]  They have nukes.
[01:06:44.726 --> 01:06:49.490]  This will be World War III, and it will end with horrible, horrible,
[01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:50.530]  Destruction.
[01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:52.612]  So don't even think about Wall Street.
[01:06:52.952 --> 01:06:54.393]  I see a little blimp upward.
[01:06:54.693 --> 01:06:58.396]  I see a little sucker rally for people to get involved in it.
[01:06:58.476 --> 01:06:59.636]  The dead cat bounce.
[01:06:59.837 --> 01:07:00.297]  That's right.
[01:07:00.677 --> 01:07:06.561]  They throw it off of the Bankers Trust building, the tomb of Mausolus, down on Wall Street below.
[01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:07.422]  And it bounces.
[01:07:07.782 --> 01:07:08.422]  One big bounce.
[01:07:08.803 --> 01:07:09.363]  People get in.
[01:07:09.403 --> 01:07:10.844]  They say, everything is over.
[01:07:10.964 --> 01:07:12.285]  Everything is going to be great again.
[01:07:13.005 --> 01:07:17.891]  And by the way, one of the things that they're doing is driving the price of oil down now.
[01:07:18.311 --> 01:07:24.458]  They drove it up, and now the same people, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, their analysts are putting out reports.
[01:07:24.898 --> 01:07:25.559]  Oil is going to go down.
[01:07:25.579 --> 01:07:30.785]  I was reading that upwards of 90% of the oil speculation was driven by Goldman Sachs.
[01:07:30.905 --> 01:07:32.466]  Yeah, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
[01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:37.570]  They're the only two left standing, by the way, with the great, big death on Wall Street.
[01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.772]  So we also have this vertical integration happening.
[01:07:39.972 --> 01:07:47.939]  Yeah, and Goldman Sachs, you have Henry Paulson there, and by the way, before him, the Clinton administration had Robert Rubin, who came from what Wall Street firm?
[01:07:47.979 --> 01:07:48.559]  Goldman Sachs.
[01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:49.360]  Goldman Sachs!
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.102]  And Mr. Neal Keshe Carey, okay?
[01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:52.763]  Goldman Sachs.
[01:07:52.783 --> 01:07:54.044]  Goldman Sachs, of course!
[01:07:54.424 --> 01:07:55.065]  There they are!
[01:07:55.085 --> 01:07:57.306]  Hold on, final segment, we're going to Tarpley here in a moment, here we go.
[01:07:58.007 --> 01:07:59.708]  On the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.195 --> 01:08:03.997]  And just a couple minutes, we're going to Webster Tarbley for the rest of the hour.
[01:08:04.037 --> 01:08:06.779]  Really appreciate him joining us to track what's happening with the election.
[01:08:07.119 --> 01:08:09.020]  Wow, text Mars and...
[01:08:10.307 --> 01:08:13.209]  Webster Tarpley agreeing that Obama is the New World Order's man.
[01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:16.351]  I tell you, it's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:08:16.391 --> 01:08:21.175]  Get his book, Mysterious Monuments, What These Nuts Are Into, at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:21.215 --> 01:08:22.456]  Amazing book we've been talking about.
[01:08:22.476 --> 01:08:29.080]  Or call toll free to get it at 888-253-3139, triple 8, 253-3139.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.603]  And you'll be able to watch this video we're doing live right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:33.904 --> 01:08:35.285]  That's posted for the members.
[01:08:36.428 --> 01:08:37.028]  There as well.
[01:08:37.508 --> 01:09:00.675]  Just in two minutes closing, and for TarPlay I want to get his comment on this as soon as you leave us, Colin Powell, Gordon Brown, we've got Nicholas Sarkozy, we've got the Israeli leaders, we've got Joe Biden all saying massive terror attack, probably nuclear, that's what AFP is reporting today, is going to happen to test Obama
[01:09:01.605 --> 01:09:02.366]  They're testing us!
[01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:04.168]  Are we going to get tough and have bigger wars?
[01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:08.172]  We can sit here and smile about it, because we've got good cheer.
[01:09:08.193 --> 01:09:10.255]  I laugh because it's so crazy.
[01:09:10.675 --> 01:09:17.623]  But God help us, because they need something to start World War III, and they need a global meltdown to bring in their new world order.
[01:09:17.643 --> 01:09:19.185]  So, closing comments on that, Tex Marsh.
[01:09:19.557 --> 01:09:23.860]  Well, I'm convinced this is a prophetic scenario right out of Ezekiel 38 and 39.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.282]  But it's interesting that they're the ones playing out this scenario.
[01:09:28.302 --> 01:09:30.084]  It's almost like they're compelled.
[01:09:30.664 --> 01:09:31.464]  They have to do it.
[01:09:31.484 --> 01:09:34.987]  They're obsessed with this framework.
[01:09:35.007 --> 01:09:37.128]  Well, look at how they're bringing in the implantable microchips.
[01:09:37.168 --> 01:09:39.469]  Look at how they, the mark to buy and sell.
[01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.511]  I mean, they just can't help it.
[01:09:42.091 --> 01:09:43.272]  No, no, they can't happen.
[01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:45.293]  And that's why it's going to occur.
[01:09:45.634 --> 01:09:47.255]  And by the way, I want to leave you with one thing.
[01:09:47.335 --> 01:09:48.596]  Gog and Magog.
[01:09:48.656 --> 01:09:56.101]  These mysterious devil demons that bring the whole world into catastrophe with war in the last days.
[01:09:56.982 --> 01:10:07.169]  In London, England, at Gill Hall, where the Mayor of England is, they have erected statues inside the actual chapel or sanctuary.
[01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:08.890]  In London, England,
[01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:12.825]  And they have secret rituals there at Guildhall.
[01:10:13.145 --> 01:10:18.129]  They have erected statues of the idols Gog and Magog.
[01:10:18.329 --> 01:10:19.410]  You say, that's incredible.
[01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:28.178]  They're in Roman warrior uniforms and they have been placed behind the, or next to the altar in the chapel of Guildhall.
[01:10:28.578 --> 01:10:29.479]  People, you don't believe it?
[01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:34.603]  Go to Google and type in Gog Magog London Guildhall.
[01:10:35.003 --> 01:10:37.846]  They actually have idol statues of Gog and Magog.
[01:10:38.226 --> 01:10:38.966]  It's ready to go.
[01:10:39.046 --> 01:10:43.368]  And the point is here, folks, just from a secular perspective, these nuts really are into the occult.
[01:10:43.428 --> 01:10:44.829]  They really do believe all this.
[01:10:44.889 --> 01:10:47.330]  Elites always go insane throughout history.
[01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:48.850]  It is now happening.
[01:10:49.331 --> 01:10:54.113]  And folks can get a copy of your gorgeous newsletter for free each month.
[01:10:54.173 --> 01:10:55.893]  Give folks the number to call and get that.
[01:10:56.073 --> 01:11:00.875]  Well, folks can go to PowerOfProphecy.com, PowerOfProphecy.com, or call us toll-free, 1-800-234-96...
[01:11:08.554 --> 01:11:10.817]  My goodness.
[01:11:10.917 --> 01:11:12.559]  I've only been there 22 years.
[01:11:12.579 --> 01:11:20.128]  Listen, I've got so many computer codes and house codes and safe codes and gun safe codes.
[01:11:20.148 --> 01:11:20.348]  9-6-7-0.
[01:11:20.368 --> 01:11:20.949]  Give it out.
[01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:21.770]  I'm the same way.
[01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:25.754]  This morning I had to call the guys because I got here first.
[01:11:26.435 --> 01:11:28.697]  I had to call and say, what's the code to the office?
[01:11:30.559 --> 01:11:32.500]  So much, I mean, it's kind of like absent-minded professor.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:36.523]  As long as you remember your wife's birthday and your anniversary, you're safe, Alex.
[01:11:36.563 --> 01:11:38.284]  Just remember that as a young man.
[01:11:38.584 --> 01:11:39.444]  I remember those two.
[01:11:39.484 --> 01:11:40.185]  No, but give him the number.
[01:11:40.205 --> 01:11:40.305]  1-800-234-9670.
[01:11:40.365 --> 01:11:41.706]  And ask for the free edition, the newsletter.
[01:11:41.766 --> 01:11:43.247]  Give it again.
[01:11:43.267 --> 01:11:43.327]  1-800-234-9670.
[01:11:43.347 --> 01:11:44.227]  Okay, I got it.
[01:11:52.032 --> 01:11:52.912]  Awesome having you here.
[01:11:52.932 --> 01:11:53.433]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:11:53.493 --> 01:11:57.794]  Thank you much for coming in to say hi to the whole crew and to WANDA for me.
[01:11:58.074 --> 01:12:00.295]  God bless you and keep up your great work here.
[01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:06.617]  And these people are out there that are disinformation agents, paid operatives of Mossad and the CIA.
[01:12:08.106 --> 01:12:12.249]  They're there because they're worried because you're making an impact.
[01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:14.570]  That's why they've targeted folks like you and me.
[01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:19.934]  And this audience out there has to know this is our time to talk about what Obama said.
[01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:24.597]  This is our opportunity to tell the absolute unvarnished truth.
[01:12:24.717 --> 01:12:25.657]  Tex, thanks for coming in.
[01:12:25.837 --> 01:12:26.318]  All right, my friend.
[01:12:26.658 --> 01:12:26.798]  Bye-bye.
[01:12:26.818 --> 01:12:27.298]  Take care.
[01:12:27.418 --> 01:12:29.540]  All right, I appreciate Webster Tarpley finishing.
[01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:30.961]  I got Tex on a little bit late.
[01:12:31.321 --> 01:12:32.922]  We've got him for the rest of the hour.
[01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:35.384]  He's got two books out on Obama.
[01:12:36.756 --> 01:12:40.537]  And we really appreciate him coming on the show with us today.
[01:12:40.677 --> 01:12:54.302]  Out of the gates, Webster, I have AFP, I have Reuters, I have articles that we've done that condense it all, Colin Powell warns of coming crisis we don't even know about right now, terror attacks, Joe Biden saying the same thing.
[01:12:54.802 --> 01:12:56.843]  Webster, what are they getting us ready for?
[01:12:56.863 --> 01:12:58.824]  This is extremely cryptic.
[01:12:59.484 --> 01:13:02.125]  I think, Alex, thank you for having me today.
[01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:09.133]  I think we have to look at this Seattle outburst by Biden as absolutely fundamental, right?
[01:13:09.173 --> 01:13:15.095]  That there's a generated crisis coming, it's going to involve Russia, the righteousness of the U.S.
[01:13:15.155 --> 01:13:24.258]  position will not be immediately apparent, and I do agree, he's talking about a return to false flag operations in grand style.
[01:13:24.318 --> 01:13:32.861]  Now, you'll remember, one of the complaints coming from the Obama forces, the Atlantic Monthly in particular, a guy called Andrew Sullivan,
[01:13:33.322 --> 01:13:35.723]  Who's one of the leading Kool-Aid drinkers for Obama.
[01:13:36.103 --> 01:13:46.466]  Back in December, and this is quoted in this book of mine, Obama, The Postmodern Coup, he says, right now, it would be impossible to have a false flag.
[01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:49.667]  I'm sort of simplifying the language to get to the reality of it.
[01:13:50.087 --> 01:14:01.910]  But he says, right now, our imperialism can no longer use false flag because Bush is so hated and so discredited that if we had a false flag event and Bush came forward blaming country X,
[01:14:02.719 --> 01:14:10.621]  No one would believe him, virtually nobody would believe him, and a significant majority, a minority at least, would say, you did it yourself, Bush.
[01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:12.281]  You are responsible.
[01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:18.803]  So, Andrew Sullivan presented Obama as a way to refurbish the credibility of the U.S.
[01:14:18.863 --> 01:14:25.884]  regime at home and abroad, so that they could then proceed to a new round of false flag operations.
[01:14:25.964 --> 01:14:29.085]  And indeed, this is pretty much what I've been writing about all year.
[01:14:29.425 --> 01:14:32.246]  The kinds of targets, though, that you've got to look at would be
[01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:43.262]  In the first rank, places like Pakistan and Sudan, where there is a great desire for operations, I would have to disagree with Jim Mars.
[01:14:43.302 --> 01:14:45.443]  This guy, Zardari, is Mr. 15%.
[01:14:45.903 --> 01:14:48.183]  He's corrupt, as can be.
[01:14:48.223 --> 01:14:52.184]  He's one of the greatest kleptocrats of the past 20 years.
[01:14:52.524 --> 01:14:57.966]  But the problem is not even for them, Zardari, or the Prime Minister Gilani of Pakistan.
[01:14:58.422 --> 01:15:02.828]  It is the desire for the partition of Pakistan, to split it up.
[01:15:03.328 --> 01:15:06.632]  Brzezinski writes these books, Second Chance and others.
[01:15:06.792 --> 01:15:09.215]  Well, the British have already tried to do that once.
[01:15:09.956 --> 01:15:14.702]  Well, they're trying again, and the whole purpose of having these bloody attacks by the U.S.
[01:15:14.762 --> 01:15:15.423]  into Northwest
[01:15:15.922 --> 01:15:20.007]  Pakistan has nothing to do with this crazy mythology of Bin Laden.
[01:15:20.067 --> 01:15:23.410]  No, I understand, but let's go back to the incredible bombshell you just dropped on us.
[01:15:24.772 --> 01:15:25.673]  And I agree with you.
[01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:26.994]  Obama's their new horse.
[01:15:27.074 --> 01:15:27.935]  Obama's fresh.
[01:15:28.776 --> 01:15:30.638]  He can reinvigorate things.
[01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:32.020]  McCain would be seen as Bush 3.
[01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:37.262]  And certainly the media is totally swung into favor of Barack Obama.
[01:15:37.282 --> 01:15:39.403]  If it wasn't clear before, it certainly is.
[01:15:39.423 --> 01:15:43.464]  The Wall Street money is pouring in, a hundred and something million in one week.
[01:15:45.005 --> 01:15:46.825]  I mean, it's just a hundred and fifty million in one week.
[01:15:47.345 --> 01:15:48.666]  It's all off the charts.
[01:15:48.986 --> 01:15:55.408]  They're even suddenly all over ESPN running all these shows about black athletes and all they went through and tying it into Obama.
[01:15:55.868 --> 01:15:58.049]  I mean, I've never seen a full court press
[01:15:59.069 --> 01:16:25.258]  uh... like this going on and and and if there is an attack stirring up something with russia you know this isn't iraq this is an afghanistan i mean where do you see them starting a new they already tried in georgia with russia uh... to you know may and then what type of false flag would be used uh... to to somehow blame russia well the country that would be targeted again would be in the first rank the most obvious one sudan
[01:16:25.891 --> 01:16:30.152]  Biden, in other speeches, has been constantly calling for an attack on Sudan.
[01:16:30.212 --> 01:16:36.053]  So a smaller snack to embolden him to say, look how well he handled Pakistan, where Obama said he wants to go.
[01:16:36.113 --> 01:16:37.233]  Well, wait, wait.
[01:16:37.373 --> 01:16:40.054]  We have to think of a broad range of possibilities.
[01:16:40.114 --> 01:16:42.854]  The most obvious are Sudan and Pakistan.
[01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:48.575]  Obama is on record demanding the bombing and actually land invasion of Pakistan.
[01:16:48.595 --> 01:16:51.856]  When Obama said in his convention stadium speech
[01:16:52.509 --> 01:16:56.910]  We've got to go and get Osama Bin Laden in the cave where he lives.
[01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:00.151]  That means invade Pakistan in their language.
[01:17:00.531 --> 01:17:18.216]  Biden has been the big guy calling for an attack on Sudan, but of course behind this is the question of Russia and China, and whether they would dare to try to do something to pin terrorism on Putin or the Chinese leadership or some other combination, or it might be something reaching into
[01:17:18.846 --> 01:17:24.811]  A place like Kazakhstan, you just don't know, that would give a possibility of delving further into the soft side of the economy.
[01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:32.157]  So to give him the name as, oh look, he's already won something up front, to then build him up as a war leader for a larger confrontation with Russia?
[01:17:32.617 --> 01:17:45.227]  Well, I don't know if we can be so specific about the details right now, but it's clear that what he's talking about, where it's not going to be apparent that we're right, as Biden says in this famous outburst of yesterday,
[01:17:45.774 --> 01:17:58.721]  It's going to be, in other words, a hard sell, because I think one of the benefits of the 9-11 Truth Movement, the one of the things that you and others and I have been able to accomplish, is that there is a great deal more skepticism about false flag.
[01:17:59.201 --> 01:18:02.422]  I would add, under McCain, this would be virtually hopeless.
[01:18:02.462 --> 01:18:11.247]  It would be virtually hopeless for McCain to come out and say, some bomb went off, country X did it, this is now the new enemy, let's run to attack country X.
[01:18:11.929 --> 01:18:12.649]  Very hard to do.
[01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:22.734]  With Obama, there is at least a fighting chance for these imperialists to get credibility, because Obama has this hardcore of dedicated, fanatical supporters.
[01:18:22.814 --> 01:18:29.717]  The left liberals, the Kool-Aid drinkers, this personality cult that is coalesced around him.
[01:18:29.737 --> 01:18:32.658]  Again, with these strong fascistoid overtones.
[01:18:33.298 --> 01:18:34.199]  They will be out there.
[01:18:34.239 --> 01:18:35.379]  This is what Obama is saying.
[01:18:35.439 --> 01:18:39.621]  We will need you to stand with us, because it's not going to be apparent that we're right.
[01:18:40.017 --> 01:18:43.918]  The other possibility, of course, is sort of on the lines of Georgia.
[01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:48.059]  We saw Georgia under Saakashvili... Using proxies!
[01:18:48.459 --> 01:18:54.901]  Yeah, using proxies, and in the case of Georgia, it was not apparent that the U.S.-NATO position was right.
[01:18:54.941 --> 01:19:00.442]  It was rather apparent that it was wrong, that Saakashvili and Georgia were clearly the aggressors.
[01:19:00.522 --> 01:19:05.704]  Maybe there's some other situation like this, something involving Ukraine or Poland.
[01:19:05.724 --> 01:19:06.464]  You've got to remember
[01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:11.826]  That the real strategic heart of the world is not the Persian Gulf, by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:19:12.186 --> 01:19:13.187]  It's Eastern Europe.
[01:19:13.227 --> 01:19:16.289]  That's the Haushofer-McKinder heartland.
[01:19:16.349 --> 01:19:20.312]  It more or less coincides with places like Poland and the Ukraine.
[01:19:20.332 --> 01:19:21.332]  It's those crossroads.
[01:19:22.073 --> 01:19:28.897]  If you start something there, then everything is at stake immediately, because the ICBMs are on both sides.
[01:19:28.917 --> 01:19:31.118]  And then suddenly you'll have the left all behind it.
[01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:33.060]  It's like the Vietnam War and LBJ.
[01:19:34.248 --> 01:19:36.990]  That is the advantage that Obama brings.
[01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:44.533]  He can mobilize 200,000 German lemmings in Berlin, and he can mobilize his Kool-Aid legions and cult following here in the United States.
[01:19:44.553 --> 01:19:46.114]  And boy, are they Kool-Aid legions.
[01:19:46.154 --> 01:19:50.236]  Every time I have you on, we get threatening phone calls from people saying we need to be arrested.
[01:19:50.336 --> 01:19:52.037]  I mean, we are in big troubles.
[01:19:52.397 --> 01:19:52.937]  Skip this break.
[01:19:54.517 --> 01:19:58.399]  Webster, I'm going to continue on the web here at PrisonPlanet.tv, skipping, it's too important.
[01:19:58.679 --> 01:20:00.660]  Sorry I got you on late, I was finishing up with text.
[01:20:01.861 --> 01:20:05.803]  Specifically though, where do you see false flag in this?
[01:20:05.883 --> 01:20:09.224]  Setting off a nuke at a U.S.
[01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.425]  base in Pakistan?
[01:20:10.785 --> 01:20:12.386]  Setting off a nuke in Israel?
[01:20:12.406 --> 01:20:14.847]  The entire range of possibilities.
[01:20:16.348 --> 01:20:26.330]  Powell loves to brag, Biden loves to brag, the French President, all of them are saying, we know what it is, we can't tell you, it's going to be big, and AFP says it's nuke.
[01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:29.750]  A nuke incident would make 9-11 a significant nuke commission.
[01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:32.531]  I mean, they are really pouring the fear on again.
[01:20:33.811 --> 01:20:38.872]  The door is now reopening, and again, this all depends on getting Obama elected.
[01:20:39.592 --> 01:20:45.813]  I would remind people, back in May of 2005, we had a similar situation in Europe and France.
[01:20:46.294 --> 01:20:55.561]  Specifically, there was this monstrous European Constitution, which was pure oligarchy, elitism, the rule of the bankers, horrendous kind of stuff.
[01:20:55.701 --> 01:20:57.262]  And it got shot down in France.
[01:20:57.342 --> 01:20:58.743]  And it was rejected.
[01:20:58.903 --> 01:21:08.871]  And in that situation in France, you had all of the parties and all of the media were telling everybody, you've got to vote for this, if you don't vote for it, you're a racist, you're a neo-Nazi.
[01:21:08.951 --> 01:21:12.834]  But they have integrity in their machines, we don't have integrity, Webster.
[01:21:13.863 --> 01:21:17.504]  Well, you know, vote fraud can manufacture 10-15%.
[01:21:17.704 --> 01:21:19.965]  I don't know.
[01:21:20.365 --> 01:21:21.766]  I think these polls are all fake.
[01:21:22.186 --> 01:21:23.526]  That is what we know for sure.
[01:21:23.866 --> 01:21:35.270]  In Obama the Postmodern Coup, I make this lengthy comparison between the Obama campaign and what went on in Ukraine or Georgia or these other places, and fake polling is absolutely fundamental.
[01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:37.531]  So I think right now you have to discount all polling.
[01:21:37.931 --> 01:21:38.731]  It's all a fake.
[01:21:39.216 --> 01:21:47.681]  I see a great wave of fear and loathing against Obama, which is now overpowering the residual hatred of Bush, Cheney, and the Republicans.
[01:21:47.701 --> 01:21:49.162]  No, no, I agree with you, but I interrupted.
[01:21:49.182 --> 01:21:54.745]  Finish up your analogy with the treaty failing three years ago and then failing again in Ireland with the Lisbon.
[01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:56.866]  Yeah, and the Netherlands, too.
[01:21:56.926 --> 01:22:08.313]  In other words, when you have an attempt to ram an oligarchical, elitist, banker's monstrosity down the head of a people that I think the American people are still
[01:22:08.869 --> 01:22:11.750]  Anti-fascist at heart and a desire to be free.
[01:22:12.251 --> 01:22:23.256]  There's always the possibility that you get this kind of a backlash against international financiers and the kinds of things that they, like Obama, recommend.
[01:22:23.276 --> 01:22:25.237]  So I think we may be headed into something like that.
[01:22:25.277 --> 01:22:34.782]  In other words, a stunning defeat for the oligarchical power machine just based on the fact... Wait, you're predicting you think Obama is going to lose?
[01:22:35.575 --> 01:22:36.416]  Yeah, sure, why not?
[01:22:36.816 --> 01:22:37.677]  Of course he can lose.
[01:22:38.237 --> 01:22:39.138]  Of course he can lose.
[01:22:39.358 --> 01:22:40.819]  Because these are all fake polls.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.222]  I don't see any reason to believe any of these.
[01:22:44.242 --> 01:22:45.343]  Alright, we'll see what happens.
[01:22:45.383 --> 01:22:46.043]  We'll see what happens.
[01:22:46.063 --> 01:22:49.246]  The polling situation is now so fake that Gallup has two polls.
[01:22:49.286 --> 01:22:53.189]  They have one poll which is traditional, and another poll which is expanded.
[01:22:53.529 --> 01:22:57.052]  And expanded means, you know, any freak can get on there.
[01:22:57.092 --> 01:22:59.674]  They ask you a question, have you ever voted before?
[01:23:00.054 --> 01:23:01.736]  No, but I'm going to vote for Obama.
[01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:04.678]  Normally that would disqualify you, because it means that you're not going to vote.
[01:23:05.066 --> 01:23:13.452]  But on the expanded poll, they'll put you on there as a percentage point for Obama, because they want to gin up a big... Now, I understand the tricks with polls.
[01:23:13.972 --> 01:23:15.514]  I'm sure the listeners know about that as well.
[01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:18.996]  I mean, look, it's just horrible any way you cut it.
[01:23:19.136 --> 01:23:20.697]  I mean, Palin is completely scary.
[01:23:20.837 --> 01:23:21.898]  It's just, I don't know.
[01:23:22.218 --> 01:23:22.779]  Well, wait.
[01:23:23.119 --> 01:23:25.661]  You know, Palin, you don't really know who Palin is at all.
[01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:29.684]  They've surrounded her with a bunch of unemployed neocons who have been brainwashing her.
[01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.145]  I think she's probably better
[01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:33.790]  She's a little bit like Wagner's music.
[01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:35.070]  She's better than it sounds.
[01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:38.951]  But the main thing to look at is structure.
[01:23:39.371 --> 01:23:43.552]  In other words, do you want a one-party regime, Obama-Pelosi-Reid?
[01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.153]  That is the Mussolini-fascist corporate state.
[01:23:46.533 --> 01:23:52.995]  If you have divided government, say McCain... Yeah, you'll have a dead duck with McCain, totally lame, and here we go back to the full audience.
[01:24:04.569 --> 01:24:06.870]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?
[01:24:07.850 --> 01:24:11.951]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[01:24:12.271 --> 01:24:14.751]  Find these pounds just like no band did run.
[01:24:14.911 --> 01:24:19.492]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[01:24:20.113 --> 01:24:22.513]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[01:24:22.613 --> 01:24:26.214]  The boys up there stickin' that platter, and there's
[01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:28.356]  I'm controlling myself.
[01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:31.518]  Instead of singing, I was lip-singing for PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:24:32.479 --> 01:24:35.702]  Eastbound and down, loaded up and truckin'.
[01:24:36.963 --> 01:24:38.164]  That's Aaron's favorite song.
[01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:43.668]  You know, I'm trying to laugh and have fun.
[01:24:43.688 --> 01:24:48.232]  We have the banks completely raping us, setting up a world dictatorship of the banking elite.
[01:24:48.252 --> 01:24:50.834]  You get 95, 98, depending on the poll.
[01:24:52.015 --> 01:24:55.138]  Thousand-to-one phone calls into Congress against the banker takeover bill.
[01:24:55.158 --> 01:24:56.199]  They still just do it.
[01:24:59.147 --> 01:25:02.548]  So the people are waking up, but the elite is just going ahead with it all.
[01:25:04.328 --> 01:25:12.710]  You got Colin Powell and Biden and all of them running around fear-mongering, saying get ready for massive events that will test us.
[01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:15.231]  Webster Tarbley, where do you see all this going, my friend?
[01:25:16.031 --> 01:25:23.012]  Well, the main thing is to come out of this not having a one-party totalitarian state.
[01:25:23.093 --> 01:25:25.073]  In other words, the worst possible outcome is
[01:25:25.609 --> 01:25:27.550]  Obama, Pelosi, and Reid.
[01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:29.350]  That is the fascist corporate state.
[01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:38.293]  That will, in particular, trample on the First Amendment and free speech in a way that Bush and Cheney never dreamed of.
[01:25:38.713 --> 01:25:41.454]  And they will do this with the help of their myrmidons, right?
[01:25:41.494 --> 01:25:52.837]  This fanatical cult following, the squadristi or stormoptylon or whatever you want to call it that they have going both on the Internet and also in the streets and in the gutters.
[01:25:54.348 --> 01:25:58.130]  The minimum to come out of this with, I would say, is divided government.
[01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:04.253]  In other words, the President of one party and the Congress of another party, and let's have trench warfare between them.
[01:26:04.293 --> 01:26:05.633]  Let's have partisan gridlock.
[01:26:05.973 --> 01:26:07.034]  Let's have paralysis.
[01:26:07.394 --> 01:26:12.756]  Let's have the most extreme form of confrontation, because the issues are huge.
[01:26:13.156 --> 01:26:14.317]  There is a depression now.
[01:26:14.357 --> 01:26:19.339]  We are descending into a new world economic and financial depression of tremendous severity.
[01:26:19.879 --> 01:26:21.100]  McCain has no answers.
[01:26:21.536 --> 01:26:23.878]  The Democratic side actually do have answers.
[01:26:23.938 --> 01:26:26.119]  Their answer is the fascist corporate state.
[01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:38.108]  We had this guy, Kramer, go on CNBC last Thursday saying that they want more bailouts, more trillions in effect for Wall Street and the derivatives.
[01:26:38.168 --> 01:26:49.015]  And Kramer even said, under questioning, he wants to loot the Social Security Trust Fund of $100 billion for starters to try to shore up toxic derivative paper.
[01:26:49.075 --> 01:26:50.116]  Now, this is impossible.
[01:26:50.675 --> 01:26:50.876]  I think so.
[01:27:02.352 --> 01:27:04.053]  They've got to have the one-party state.
[01:27:04.093 --> 01:27:08.054]  They've got to have Pelosi... I agree, but Webster... He's a veto-proof majority.
[01:27:08.294 --> 01:27:17.418]  How obvious is it that Obama's bad when you have the big Republican frontman who shook the vial of anthrax and said they had nukes to the U.N.
[01:27:17.438 --> 01:27:27.702]  and now he's the darling of the left and he says Obama's good and he said on Meet the Press it's going to be this transformative person of Obama
[01:27:28.682 --> 01:27:35.528]  And he went on to say, because he knows what to do with the banker bailouts, and McCain didn't want to do it.
[01:27:35.808 --> 01:27:40.212]  So he's, I mean, my goodness, we're getting an endorsement from the good ol' boy club right there.
[01:27:40.952 --> 01:27:42.794]  Well, Colin Powell's an interesting story.
[01:27:43.134 --> 01:27:50.220]  I think the thing that motivates him most of all is his near-do-well, wastrel son, Michael Powell.
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:56.185]  Colin Powell's a nepotist, and I think when he signed on as Secretary of State with Bush Cheney,
[01:27:56.707 --> 01:28:02.570]  He said, I'll take this job, but I want a plum post for my idiot son, Michael Powell.
[01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:05.351]  And that was the Federal Communications Commission.
[01:28:05.371 --> 01:28:13.815]  And you'll remember, Michael Powell was on the one side a servant of the cartels and the monopolies and the oligopolies of the communications industry.
[01:28:14.175 --> 01:28:19.457]  On the other side, he had this vendetta against Howard Stern, clashed with Howard Stern.
[01:28:21.582 --> 01:28:25.205]  Ah, the presence of mind to say, look, you're only here because of your father.
[01:28:25.245 --> 01:28:26.105]  You have no talent.
[01:28:26.405 --> 01:28:30.348]  You're simply a hanger-on and you got your job because of your famous father.
[01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:38.453]  Now, Colin Powell now has to take care of Michael Powell for another 10 years in another administration, this time with Democrats.
[01:28:38.493 --> 01:28:41.736]  So he's trying to fix up his son.
[01:28:41.776 --> 01:28:49.601]  The parallel to this, very interesting distant mirror, Field Marshal von Hindenburg, another soldier who became a politician.
[01:28:49.929 --> 01:28:58.014]  Was, of course, the main German commander in World War I, then became, after 1925, the President of Germany, the President of the Weimar Republic.
[01:28:58.654 --> 01:29:07.400]  Up until 1933, Hindenburg had always said, I will never let this bohemian corporal Hitler ever become President of Germany.
[01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:08.520]  This is unspeakable.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:10.201]  The guy is a gutter snipe.
[01:29:10.942 --> 01:29:19.567]  Eventually, though, it turned out his son, Oskar von Hindenburg, had gambling debts and problems with embezzlement and possible criminal charges.
[01:29:20.009 --> 01:29:23.812]  And at that point the Nazis pulled that chain and Hindenburg caved in.
[01:29:24.152 --> 01:29:25.273]  Alright, stay there.
[01:29:25.313 --> 01:29:26.274]  Gotta break Webster.
[01:29:26.354 --> 01:29:37.382]  And it's the same thing at a lower level with Oliver Stone making these government worship films like W. I mean, he's got all these drug convictions and is facing prison if he doesn't sell out.
[01:29:38.102 --> 01:29:39.363]  Webster Tarbley's our guest.
[01:29:39.843 --> 01:29:40.324]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.166 --> 01:29:44.066]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.567 --> 01:29:46.048]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.083 --> 01:29:49.764]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:50.424 --> 01:29:51.644]  Alright, bring me back to Webster.
[01:29:51.684 --> 01:29:52.564]  I'm skipping everything.
[01:29:52.584 --> 01:29:53.385]  This is too important.
[01:29:53.945 --> 01:29:54.985]  Webster, continue.
[01:29:55.025 --> 01:29:56.385]  You know, I hope you're right.
[01:29:56.946 --> 01:29:58.606]  It's disgusting and sick to say.
[01:29:58.946 --> 01:30:00.267]  I'm not even saying I'm voting for him.
[01:30:00.347 --> 01:30:03.007]  There's so much election fraud.
[01:30:03.427 --> 01:30:05.368]  Voting, one miserable little vote.
[01:30:05.408 --> 01:30:07.128]  No, I just can't bring myself for McCain.
[01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:08.789]  You can move millions of votes, Alex.
[01:30:09.009 --> 01:30:11.750]  Your voice can move millions of votes.
[01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:13.370]  I think there are three considerations.
[01:30:13.832 --> 01:30:15.133]  Stop Obama at all costs.
[01:30:15.733 --> 01:30:20.336]  Punish those who supported the bailout, and come out of it with divided government.
[01:30:20.376 --> 01:30:22.017]  No, I understand that, and I agree with you.
[01:30:22.237 --> 01:30:29.081]  It's just... I know Obama is vehemently, like no president ever, if he becomes an anti-gun.
[01:30:29.101 --> 01:30:30.682]  He says he's going to ban most guns.
[01:30:30.742 --> 01:30:31.262]  It's incredible.
[01:30:31.302 --> 01:30:32.062]  I mean, most rifles.
[01:30:33.683 --> 01:30:34.084]  .308, .223, everything.
[01:30:34.584 --> 01:30:36.505]  Anything that, quote, could be used in the military.
[01:30:37.646 --> 01:30:39.667]  He is, for total open borders,
[01:30:40.667 --> 01:30:50.392]  He is for corporate fascism, and he's got all these well-meaning idiots, just like all these well-meaning idiots supported George Bush over Bill Clinton, not knowing they're all puppets.
[01:30:50.712 --> 01:30:51.412]  But I agree.
[01:30:51.472 --> 01:30:57.735]  I mean, I've never seen such corporate support and the media spinning against
[01:30:59.457 --> 01:31:05.440]  Everywhere but Fox, against John McCain, and Fox is so cartoonish, no one takes it serious.
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:15.025]  And I mean, I agree that McCain will be absolutely a dead duck as president, and won't be able to get anything done, and will be hated, and then things will kind of just fall apart.
[01:31:15.465 --> 01:31:26.091]  Versus Obama, I mean, he really wants to be the world ruler, and he's got the backing to do it, but you really think that he can be beaten?
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.661]  Absolutely he can, because I think all of these polls are fake.
[01:31:30.121 --> 01:31:31.882]  I don't see any groundswell for Obama.
[01:31:31.942 --> 01:31:33.322]  I see fear and loathing.
[01:31:33.782 --> 01:31:35.563]  The other thing is, let's go through who's fighting.
[01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:38.724]  Phil Berg is fighting with that lawsuit in Philadelphia.
[01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:40.845]  He just filed new court papers yesterday.
[01:31:41.245 --> 01:31:49.708]  These are now admissions, and it says to the Obama campaign, if you don't respond to these statements within 30 days, you have admitted to them, and out you go.
[01:31:49.748 --> 01:31:55.230]  Now, 30 days, unfortunately, is no longer enough, but that's another move by Berg, and that may get him onto one of these
[01:31:56.008 --> 01:31:57.028]  Cable TV networks.
[01:31:57.108 --> 01:31:59.189]  Larry Sinclair is still fighting.
[01:31:59.229 --> 01:32:00.110]  He's still touring.
[01:32:00.810 --> 01:32:09.213]  We've got a group called the Real Democrats, who are organizing Democrats for McCain, going into Pennsylvania and Virginia.
[01:32:10.793 --> 01:32:13.154]  Then you've got these wild cards, right?
[01:32:13.714 --> 01:32:24.038]  Sometime around now, there's this famous tape by Michelle Obama, who appears together with Madame Farrakhan, and makes a racist tirade about
[01:32:24.968 --> 01:32:26.269]  A whole series of themes.
[01:32:26.329 --> 01:32:28.551]  This has now been expected.
[01:32:28.611 --> 01:32:32.254]  I mean, today was a day when some people thought it would come out.
[01:32:32.314 --> 01:32:34.095]  I would say it's more likely in about a week.
[01:32:34.175 --> 01:32:36.877]  I would say Tuesday, Wednesday of next week.
[01:32:36.897 --> 01:32:39.079]  So it's going to have maximum effect.
[01:32:39.359 --> 01:32:40.380]  Yeah, maximum effect.
[01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:45.884]  And you can't organize a counteroffensive against it because there's not enough time.
[01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:47.485]  There are various tapes.
[01:32:47.525 --> 01:32:51.808]  There's also this question of the African Press International.
[01:32:52.356 --> 01:32:54.577]  Hold on, we're going back to the full audience.
[01:32:54.717 --> 01:32:55.017]  Here we go.
[01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:57.478]  What is that horrified look on your face out there, Paul?
[01:33:23.519 --> 01:33:24.040]  Everything good?
[01:33:27.684 --> 01:33:34.631]  Oh, I think the TV guys down here want you to boost the audio, John.
[01:33:35.112 --> 01:33:35.613]  Crank it up!
[01:33:35.653 --> 01:33:36.554]  Blow my eardrums out!
[01:33:41.894 --> 01:33:42.535]  Hey!
[01:33:43.795 --> 01:33:44.836]  You know what we do here?
[01:33:45.576 --> 01:33:47.638]  The network puts it up on the satellite uplinks.
[01:33:48.018 --> 01:33:57.103]  There in Minnesota, we're in Austin, Texas, and we send out our own feeds here and PrisonPlanet.tv feeds, so it is quite a setup here.
[01:33:57.123 --> 01:34:03.327]  I appreciate John Harmon up in Minnesota, Ted Anderson, the whole crew up there, and I appreciate
[01:34:04.872 --> 01:34:13.094]  Paul Hartman and everybody else that is down here in my office, Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson, Trey Kincaid, a.k.a.
[01:34:13.174 --> 01:34:17.394]  Eddie Bear, and his dog is known as Pickle Bear, the Chihuahua.
[01:34:17.894 --> 01:34:31.117]  And again, it's in times like these when things are so dark that I try to have a little bit of fun, but very thankful for all our Aminathem affiliates, Global Troy affiliates, Satellite affiliates, the sponsors, the listeners, everybody, and my family, and the good Lord above.
[01:34:31.997 --> 01:34:36.319]  Okay, Webster, I'm going to try to just sit back for the rest of the broadcast and try to give you the floor.
[01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:37.380]  I've brought up a lot of points.
[01:34:38.301 --> 01:34:45.484]  Any way you slice it going into depression, any way you slice it, police, state, grid, you have the same elite that backs Obama, backs McCain.
[01:34:45.504 --> 01:34:47.586]  They're in power regardless with either one of these guys.
[01:34:47.966 --> 01:34:58.572]  I agree they get more traction with the front man, the new birdcage liner, who's more clean on the surface than the kind of half-used birdcage liner of McCain with his Bush association.
[01:34:59.792 --> 01:35:15.625]  But what I see is the disgusting corporate foundation left, the Noam Chomsky's, you know, who sits there in his office with a million books behind him, with that image of, you know, the genius of Earth, with this boiled-down pap for children, you know, saying basically,
[01:35:18.968 --> 01:35:23.372]  Vote for Obama, you know, not because he's good, because he's better than McCain.
[01:35:23.972 --> 01:35:27.575]  And he's not stupid, he knows it means more warmongering, more control.
[01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:34.861]  So just to see the foundation left, they are just such a nasty little crew of ne'er-do-wells.
[01:35:35.602 --> 01:35:38.664]  Can you comment on him and others, and then get into whatever you like?
[01:35:40.085 --> 01:35:45.190]  I think they were extremely important during the phase of the Democratic primaries.
[01:35:45.310 --> 01:35:47.872]  The left liberal foundation funded
[01:35:48.558 --> 01:35:56.980]  The gatekeeper or border guard left wing was used by Obama to overwhelm the Clinton machine and get the nomination.
[01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:04.423]  Now, since then, a lot of these people have actually become disillusioned with Obama because of his betrayals.
[01:36:04.483 --> 01:36:06.223]  I mean, take this FISA question, right?
[01:36:06.243 --> 01:36:07.143]  The wiretapping.
[01:36:07.784 --> 01:36:16.086]  Obama had pledged that he would filibuster any attempt to renew the FISA shenanigans of Bush and to give retroactive immunity
[01:36:16.536 --> 01:36:17.857]  To the telecom companies.
[01:36:18.057 --> 01:36:20.179]  And instead, Obama voted for it.
[01:36:20.539 --> 01:36:24.742]  He had said that he was against free trade and NAFTA, or suggested he might be.
[01:36:25.042 --> 01:36:26.703]  And then he actively embraced it.
[01:36:27.063 --> 01:36:29.905]  And then even on the Iraq War, he said, I'll have a timetable.
[01:36:29.966 --> 01:36:35.389]  And then his advisor said, no, no, he's not going to be bound by any silly campaign promises.
[01:36:35.409 --> 01:36:39.392]  So some of these left liberals are in crisis.
[01:36:40.173 --> 01:36:42.775]  But there are a lot of them that still remain on board.
[01:36:43.235 --> 01:36:46.037]  Surely, a night of the long knives is coming.
[01:36:46.607 --> 01:37:12.067]  For them, and I think if you get back to this remarkable statement by Biden in Seattle, because he not only says apparently that they're going to go back to false flags to get the new enemies list established, he also talks about a systemic economic crisis where the measures that Obama will introduce will be so unpopular that the Obama regime will collapse in the polls.
[01:37:12.985 --> 01:37:16.508]  People who are going to say, wait a minute, what decisions are you making, Obama?
[01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:19.631]  And why are the polls so low?
[01:37:20.212 --> 01:37:24.996]  And Biden has to appeal to them and say, you hardcore of rich elitists.
[01:37:25.016 --> 01:37:29.380]  Because he's in Seattle, he might have Bill and Melinda Gates there, for all we know.
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:31.001]  Or people of this type, right?
[01:37:31.061 --> 01:37:31.582]  Balmer.
[01:37:32.423 --> 01:37:35.025]  People who run Microsoft, sitting there for Biden.
[01:37:35.464 --> 01:37:40.087]  And he says, we will have to make economic decisions that are going to be extremely unpopular.
[01:37:40.427 --> 01:37:42.788]  And if they're popular, they won't be sound.
[01:37:42.848 --> 01:37:44.029]  So we want them to be sound.
[01:37:44.049 --> 01:37:46.170]  They're going to be extremely unpopular.
[01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:48.311]  This is an amazing document.
[01:37:48.371 --> 01:37:58.056]  In other words, I would urge people, organize now for the next two weeks on the basis of the fact we have got the printout of the Obama regime.
[01:37:58.476 --> 01:38:01.458]  He's going to attack his own base, including these left liberals.
[01:38:01.818 --> 01:38:03.299]  He's going to betray his own base.
[01:38:03.723 --> 01:38:05.964]  He's going to become unbelievably unpopular.
[01:38:06.264 --> 01:38:10.886]  This was something that I had in mind when I did Obama the Postmodern Coup back in the springtime.
[01:38:10.906 --> 01:38:21.531]  I went back and wrote a 40-page short history of the Carter regime, the last trilateral puppet with a real catastrophic presidency with Volker and Brzezinski.
[01:38:22.031 --> 01:38:29.234]  And what you see in Carter is that he began collapsing right after the 100 days were over.
[01:38:29.254 --> 01:38:33.296]  In other words, three months into his first term, his only term, he began
[01:38:33.775 --> 01:38:34.295]  Collapsing.
[01:38:34.355 --> 01:38:41.457]  And I said to myself, well, it took Carter about 12 months to become completely unpopular and basically hated.
[01:38:41.557 --> 01:38:43.238]  How long will it take for Obama?
[01:38:43.638 --> 01:38:49.660]  Well, certainly less than 12 months because of the increased crisis that we face today.
[01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:55.661]  The situation much further far gone than with Carter.
[01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:59.302]  So that is what Obama, what Biden has now told us.
[01:39:00.663 --> 01:39:01.563]  Biden is a guy
[01:39:02.048 --> 01:39:04.070]  He's got a mind like a rag bag.
[01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:06.872]  He deals in fragments of thought, right?
[01:39:06.912 --> 01:39:07.892]  He spews them out.
[01:39:07.933 --> 01:39:08.873]  He can't shut up.
[01:39:09.894 --> 01:39:13.737]  What he's obviously done is told some briefings that he's had.
[01:39:14.237 --> 01:39:21.203]  Notice that the two campaigns, McCain and Obama-Biden, were briefed last week at the White House.
[01:39:21.303 --> 01:39:26.327]  Now, a White House briefing these days does not mean a Bush-Cheney neocon briefing.
[01:39:26.707 --> 01:39:29.049]  It means a Principles Committee briefing.
[01:39:29.089 --> 01:39:30.770]  It means something that's according to the
[01:39:31.283 --> 01:39:47.850]  Policies expressed by Rice, by Robert Gates, the Brzezinski stooge from the Carter years, Admiral Mullen, and of course Paulson, the most powerful of them all right now, the guy who actually runs the government in the economic and domestic policy.
[01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:57.494]  So what Biden seems to be regurgitating here is what he got out of that briefing that they got from the White House, which is that if Obama gets in,
[01:39:58.414 --> 01:40:08.582]  The rogue network in the government, the establishment, the permanent Washington bureaucracy, this network that goes through there at any rate, is going to try to start something.
[01:40:08.963 --> 01:40:12.345]  Again, it's time to say, we don't want to go down that road.
[01:40:13.726 --> 01:40:19.171]  Let's reject Obama, and if that means McCain, it's going to be so much harder.
[01:40:19.611 --> 01:40:20.592]  To organize this stuff.
[01:40:20.612 --> 01:40:22.894]  You can't get anybody in Europe with McCain.
[01:40:23.175 --> 01:40:25.597]  You can't get European troops and European money.
[01:40:25.878 --> 01:40:28.420]  You can't get them with McCain any more than you can get them with Bush.
[01:40:29.241 --> 01:40:32.344]  Well, I'm sure I want to focus in on what you were just saying because it's important.
[01:40:32.364 --> 01:40:40.613]  I don't want this to go over people's heads because they're halfway listening and taking groceries out of the car, writing somebody a ticket or whatever people are out there doing listening.
[01:40:42.253 --> 01:41:01.639]  They need a crisis, they need a military crisis so they can flex muscles and popularize him as a tough guy to get people to rally around the government and say, we'll do whatever the commander-in-chief says in these tough economic times because the darn Ruskies or the Pakistanis, you know, they did something wrong.
[01:41:02.259 --> 01:41:11.182]  And we've got the elite signaling that they're going to do something big for all those in the know, kind of like we had
[01:41:12.307 --> 01:41:23.078]  One of the CFR policy makers, Gary Hart, wrote a letter to Ahmed Dinejid saying, look, you better do what we say or we'll stage a terror attack on you, pal, and we're not above doing it.
[01:41:24.259 --> 01:41:35.411]  So that's a multi-faceted threat, because for the public, you know, they know the public's dumbed down, stuck on their thumbs watching football, and so they openly discuss in thinly
[01:41:36.547 --> 01:41:37.549]  Finley Bell discussions.
[01:41:38.631 --> 01:41:48.429]  The reason I brought up, so I want you to elaborate on that, A, and then B, the reason I brought up Noam Chomsky, he endorsed two days ago Barack Obama.
[01:41:49.438 --> 01:41:59.002]  And I'm just so tired of, because somebody talks with a lisp, and says they're intellectual, we fall down like they're an idol at their feet.
[01:41:59.442 --> 01:42:06.504]  I mean, I don't claim to be an intellectual, but I have guests on who are light years ahead of this guy and really talking about real issues.
[01:42:06.544 --> 01:42:10.366]  I'm just, I'm so tired of the phony right and the phony left, it makes me want to throw up.
[01:42:11.746 --> 01:42:15.447]  Well, again, how can we express this at the polls?
[01:42:15.487 --> 01:42:16.888]  Because now there is this election.
[01:42:17.743 --> 01:42:35.114]  Given the fact that we have the media whores outdoing themselves in unbelievable excesses of Obamaphilia and groupie behavior, just the idea of defeating the media's favorite candidate would be a liberating experience.
[01:42:35.154 --> 01:42:41.458]  The American people, if they could pull themselves together and defeat Obama, that would be a crushing defeat.
[01:42:41.892 --> 01:42:45.173]  To this mighty Wurlitzer that we've had going for all these years.
[01:42:45.193 --> 01:42:51.835]  That's right, because they're running a corpse against him like Bob Dole against Clinton in 96, meaning for McCain to lose.
[01:42:52.436 --> 01:42:57.617]  And if we put the corpse in office instead of him, they're going to have a lot of trouble putting perfume on that pig.
[01:42:57.977 --> 01:43:01.759]  And again, you don't get the 200,000 German lemmings with McCain.
[01:43:01.979 --> 01:43:03.379]  You don't get anything with McCain.
[01:43:03.399 --> 01:43:05.400]  You don't get a facelift for imperialism.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:08.881]  You get no credibility in Europe, no money, no troops.
[01:43:09.301 --> 01:43:11.302]  Can't send any more people to Afghanistan.
[01:43:12.049 --> 01:43:16.192]  It just puts the whole imperialist operation in a much weaker condition.
[01:43:16.233 --> 01:43:20.116]  And again, think about this stuff about the economic policies, right?
[01:43:20.156 --> 01:43:29.443]  That he's saying, Biden says, I guarantee you, I promise you, in one year, we will be a collapsed regime.
[01:43:29.483 --> 01:43:34.527]  In other words, we will have extreme unpopularity because of our economic decisions, I think,
[01:43:35.069 --> 01:43:39.992]  What he's talking about even more, maybe, than the... Why can't Biden help it?
[01:43:40.052 --> 01:43:42.334]  He just loves to talk about what's really going on.
[01:43:43.074 --> 01:43:43.374]  He does.
[01:43:43.394 --> 01:43:46.356]  He also... He's not quite aware of what he's talking to.
[01:43:46.396 --> 01:43:52.280]  In other words, I think he's got... He's got people, again, like Bill and Melinda Gates, or this guy Balmer, or others.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.661]  He's got the moneybags people.
[01:43:53.961 --> 01:44:01.206]  It's a crowd that delivered about a million dollars in two meetings in the Sheraton in
[01:44:02.384 --> 01:44:03.584]  In Seattle, Washington.
[01:44:03.624 --> 01:44:13.588]  So he thinks he's... It's a moment a little bit like Obama talking to the San Francisco group with somebody like Gordon Getty, right?
[01:44:13.628 --> 01:44:16.469]  He thinks he's in a comfortable inner sanctum.
[01:44:17.449 --> 01:44:21.150]  They're playing the old game of 10, 20 years ago when the media knew to shut up.
[01:44:22.291 --> 01:44:23.731]  The bitter clinger, right?
[01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:28.513]  The people who have no jobs and cling to guns, religion, and anti-trade.
[01:44:28.633 --> 01:44:29.593]  Anti-trade, above all.
[01:44:30.766 --> 01:44:37.492]  That has been, I think, the insight that a lot of people have into Obama comes from that particular tirade.
[01:44:37.512 --> 01:44:39.214]  I think Obama has done the same thing here.
[01:44:39.454 --> 01:44:49.564]  But also notice, he's appealing to them saying, we will require a hardcore, fanatical, determined support that will support us no matter what.
[01:44:50.124 --> 01:44:52.747]  And that is, again, an advantage of Obama.
[01:44:52.907 --> 01:44:54.789]  Obama has a following, again, I've called it,
[01:44:55.174 --> 01:44:56.814]  Basically verging on fascism.
[01:44:56.854 --> 01:45:01.436]  Well, you've been saying that for like 10, 11 months and I was like, eh, now I've run into them.
[01:45:01.816 --> 01:45:05.097]  I mean, people I've known for years are like zombies, angry with me.
[01:45:05.857 --> 01:45:08.558]  And I'm just like, man, what has come over you?
[01:45:08.598 --> 01:45:09.918]  You're just like the Bush supporters.
[01:45:10.298 --> 01:45:11.619]  We just cover the facts here.
[01:45:11.659 --> 01:45:11.999]  Webster?
[01:45:12.499 --> 01:45:15.680]  But notice with McCain, McCain has no base of support, really.
[01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:19.201]  There's no group that is absolutely devoted to McCain.
[01:45:19.261 --> 01:45:19.561]  Nobody.
[01:45:20.307 --> 01:45:42.823]  Webster, what is the elite going to do as it becomes even more apparent, more clear, that you have the military-industrial complex, the shadow government run by Wall Street, the internationalists, the Anglo-American aristocracy, oligarchs, running everything, and everything they do is unpopular.
[01:45:43.563 --> 01:45:45.284]  Every issue they're on is unpopular.
[01:45:45.645 --> 01:45:46.766]  I mean, everything they do
[01:45:48.044 --> 01:45:55.286]  Is 70 to 95 points, the bailout, you know, 99 points, 1,001 calls or more, against what the people want?
[01:45:55.326 --> 01:45:59.327]  I mean, it's becoming so obvious down the road, regardless of who gets elected.
[01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:01.668]  How do you see this all playing out?
[01:46:02.228 --> 01:46:03.828]  I mean, here's a better way.
[01:46:04.468 --> 01:46:06.669]  With a McCain, how does it play out in 60 seconds?
[01:46:06.949 --> 01:46:09.030]  With an Obama, how does it play out in 60 seconds?
[01:46:09.650 --> 01:46:14.611]  Well, with McCain, I think it leads to an abortive defeat of the ruling elite.
[01:46:14.651 --> 01:46:17.192]  In other words, it leads to a period of prolonged political
[01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:24.559]  Ferment and indecision and conflict and partisan gridlock and so forth, out of which a real alternative might come.
[01:46:24.859 --> 01:46:29.842]  It would be our job to intervene in that and try to bring out of it a viable alternative.
[01:46:29.862 --> 01:46:33.003]  We'd have to have an economic program and a whole series of other things.
[01:46:33.584 --> 01:46:41.148]  The case of Obama, remember, the genius of fascism is you've got to destroy the institutional basis of resistance.
[01:46:41.448 --> 01:46:43.449]  You've got to destroy the Democratic Party
[01:46:43.928 --> 01:46:45.489]  Destroy the trade union movement.
[01:46:45.509 --> 01:46:54.396]  You do that in part by discrediting them, by making them the bringers of austerity, this savage, brutal, crushing economic regime, right?
[01:46:54.536 --> 01:46:56.838]  Forced labor, all of this kind of stuff.
[01:46:57.519 --> 01:46:59.600]  You can destroy other institutions too.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:10.409]  The goal is to have a totally atomized population where you have what amounts then to a totalitarian police state confronting people who have no organizations.
[01:47:10.489 --> 01:47:10.869]  Right now,
[01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:18.594]  There's a tremendous backlash against the financiers, against the bailout, and it's looking for an institution that would express that.
[01:47:18.614 --> 01:47:20.735]  It could be all sorts of institutions.
[01:47:20.815 --> 01:47:23.336]  I mean, it turned out to be Joe the Plumber, right?
[01:47:23.356 --> 01:47:28.919]  This one guy comes out and expresses the fact that he doesn't like what Obama wants to do to him.
[01:47:29.381 --> 01:47:32.163]  Economically, and all of a sudden this guy becomes a hero.
[01:47:32.503 --> 01:47:41.248]  If you had an organized institution, a party, a union, a club, I don't know what, it could be all sorts of things that are impossible to predict.
[01:47:41.648 --> 01:47:45.170]  That would then become the focus of leading an opposition.
[01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:53.555]  But the goal of Obama and his crew is to fix it so that all of these institutions will be so destroyed and so wrecked
[01:47:53.939 --> 01:47:56.580]  That they'll be unviable and nobody can turn to them.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.861]  So it's just total atomized population.
[01:47:58.961 --> 01:48:02.002]  And by atomized you mean balkanized down to the smallest level.
[01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:10.705]  In other words, that the regime would confront simply individuals with no serious organizations of any kind, above all not unions.
[01:48:11.386 --> 01:48:12.547]  Well, you know what's going to happen.
[01:48:12.907 --> 01:48:17.613]  Obama is going to come after and try to ban a large portion.
[01:48:17.673 --> 01:48:18.735]  He said 223-308.
[01:48:18.815 --> 01:48:20.316]  He's going to try it.
[01:48:21.178 --> 01:48:22.639]  He's going to bring in a carbon tax.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:25.383]  Let's talk about the enforced austerity.
[01:48:26.844 --> 01:48:36.233]  You know, I mean, I get so divorced from left and right, so divorced from both puppets, that I kind of intellectually have my nose in the air, and just wouldn't look at either one of them.
[01:48:36.653 --> 01:48:38.094]  And I gotta tell you, Webster, you're right.
[01:48:38.195 --> 01:48:40.457]  I looked at Obama, and he couldn't be worse.
[01:48:40.517 --> 01:48:45.821]  I mean, this guy is so horrible, and I'm actually ashamed I didn't look at him closely earlier.
[01:48:45.841 --> 01:48:48.184]  I'm not omnipresent, as some people seem to think, folks.
[01:48:48.204 --> 01:48:49.004]  I'm just a regular guy.
[01:48:49.465 --> 01:48:51.907]  And I can't believe how bad he is.
[01:48:52.067 --> 01:48:52.608]  I mean, it is
[01:48:53.288 --> 01:48:56.470]  And he's supposedly liberal, he's black.
[01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:58.071]  This totally fools people.
[01:48:58.091 --> 01:48:58.851]  They have no idea.
[01:48:58.871 --> 01:49:03.513]  This is a Hitler, and people just can't see it because he's got black skin.
[01:49:04.734 --> 01:49:09.496]  Yes, and that's one of the reasons that his career has been fostered, was to prepare him.
[01:49:09.516 --> 01:49:14.519]  I think over as many as 25 years, he has been indoctrinated and fostered and prepared.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.780]  So tell us about the austerity.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:19.962]  You have to remember that whatever he says
[01:49:20.427 --> 01:49:30.512]  That is the merest hint of what he will do, and that's what Obama... So when he says a million-man youth brigade arresting citizens and squads of tattletale children, it's worse?
[01:49:30.692 --> 01:49:31.673]  That's just for openers.
[01:49:31.733 --> 01:49:39.676]  In other words, if he says, I'll cut 10% off your standard of living, he means 50 or 60% or whatever he can get.
[01:49:40.077 --> 01:49:41.017]  Think back to Carter.
[01:49:41.377 --> 01:49:45.900]  Carter campaigned saying, we have to do something about the problem of unemployment.
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:46.840]  We need jobs.
[01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:53.084]  As soon as he got elected, he completely reversed his field, and he said, the main problem now is inflation.
[01:49:53.785 --> 01:49:59.368]  This led to Volcker at the Federal Reserve, the 22% prime rate, the destruction of the entire U.S.
[01:49:59.428 --> 01:50:00.249]  industrial base.
[01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:01.409]  Goes back to that.
[01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:04.671]  The other side of Carter was to say, the energy crisis.
[01:50:04.711 --> 01:50:08.513]  We've got to have energy austerity, the moral equivalent of war.
[01:50:08.894 --> 01:50:10.415]  You guys have the malaise.
[01:50:10.835 --> 01:50:14.377]  Notice also, similar things between Obama and Carter.
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:19.644]  They want to blame the American people for their own incompetence.
[01:50:19.744 --> 01:50:28.191]  That was the famous Malez speech by Jimmy Carter in July of 1979, when his entire government basically imploded.
[01:50:28.491 --> 01:50:33.055]  So whatever Obama says he will do, he will do much, much worse.
[01:50:33.135 --> 01:50:38.660]  And that will be this carbon austerity, tax increases, service cuts,
[01:50:39.181 --> 01:50:43.222]  Forced labor, forced volunteer work, and all the rest of it.
[01:50:43.242 --> 01:50:47.903]  Yeah, the National Compulsory Service Act, which they say isn't a draft, but it is.
[01:50:48.784 --> 01:50:50.224]  Webster, let's continue.
[01:50:50.284 --> 01:50:52.445]  Final segment is coming up here.
[01:50:52.465 --> 01:50:54.925]  Let me go ahead and go back to Webster.
[01:50:54.965 --> 01:50:55.886]  I don't want to waste any time.
[01:50:56.906 --> 01:51:00.507]  Webster, I try not to get depressed doing these shows.
[01:51:00.527 --> 01:51:04.088]  I know it's positive to admit the facts and really go over them.
[01:51:05.273 --> 01:51:11.697]  You know, I just can't stand the Obamanoids, because I know they're well-meaning idiots, just like mainline Republicans.
[01:51:11.777 --> 01:51:14.058]  And I don't understand why people are so dumb.
[01:51:14.078 --> 01:51:15.759]  I don't think of myself as that smart.
[01:51:15.779 --> 01:51:17.400]  I think of myself as average.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.901]  How can the people not understand this or not see this?
[01:51:21.002 --> 01:51:21.862]  I just don't understand it.
[01:51:21.902 --> 01:51:22.503]  It's so obvious.
[01:51:22.523 --> 01:51:26.805]  Part of it is, people are blinded by hatred of Bush and Cheney.
[01:51:27.645 --> 01:51:32.609]  And you have to think back to the tremendous damage done by Bush and Cheney to this society.
[01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:39.934]  And we have to realize it's really just the elite agenda continuing, which Obama's going to throw himself on the sword for the elites as well.
[01:51:40.514 --> 01:51:43.376]  Well, I mean, he is the vehicle of what they do.
[01:51:43.696 --> 01:51:49.300]  See, if you go through Bush and Cheney and you don't understand what's going on, you get out of this
[01:51:49.881 --> 01:51:54.244]  The desire to be a leftist, and the desire to create a left-wing alternative.
[01:51:54.564 --> 01:51:54.864]  Aha!
[01:51:55.224 --> 01:52:02.149]  Brzezinski schooled in the service of Hegel, and this Alfred Weber, and Carl Reconquer.
[01:52:02.569 --> 01:52:06.271]  He has a left-wing alternative for you now.
[01:52:06.612 --> 01:52:13.236]  An abortive phase of left-cover, left-sloganeering, Obama the left-wing messiah.
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:19.664]  And there's just such a hatred and resentment... I'm sure you know... ...of Bernie Cheney and everything that goes with it.
[01:52:19.684 --> 01:52:23.988]  I'm sure you know that they're now actually in major newspapers calling him Jesus?
[01:52:25.969 --> 01:52:31.733]  Yeah, look, that's the other thing, is that the decomposition and collapse of society has gone much further.
[01:52:32.254 --> 01:52:42.381]  A lot of people who looked at, you know, the Mussolini movement, or the German one later, would say, this is the crazed, petty bourgeoisie, driven wild by the crisis.
[01:52:42.421 --> 01:52:43.142]  In other words, people
[01:52:43.533 --> 01:52:47.556]  Who have lost everything in the stock market collapse, and that's coming now.
[01:52:48.036 --> 01:53:03.348]  People who feel threatened in every detail of their life, who live in fear of the financial crisis, and they're looking for some kind of charismatic figure who promises to take them out of despair and into hope.
[01:53:03.408 --> 01:53:05.009]  And this is clearly Obama.
[01:53:05.289 --> 01:53:08.772]  And then, national rebirth, right?
[01:53:09.552 --> 01:53:11.774]  They've been ashamed of their country, and they've been
[01:53:12.150 --> 01:53:25.519]  They've been so full of resentment against their own government, but Obama promises somehow that in a magic process, a little bit like Carter, he'll give you a government as good and as decent and as hard-working as you think you are.
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:27.381]  So this is essentially...
[01:53:28.351 --> 01:53:31.914]  It's the desire to deliver some version of paradise on earth, right?
[01:53:31.954 --> 01:53:33.415]  Many people have... No, they love it!
[01:53:33.475 --> 01:53:38.359]  That's what you get from this new Utopia film that mixes in 9-11 truths and the monetary system.
[01:53:38.399 --> 01:53:39.300]  That's all accurate.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:45.124]  But then it offers this Valhalla of angel and withering away of the state and no one working in heaven.
[01:53:45.424 --> 01:53:48.407]  And I mean, people love just simple bull.
[01:53:48.727 --> 01:53:52.870]  I want to comment on that in the final segment, Webster, and talk about... People need to be duped.
[01:53:53.431 --> 01:53:54.792]  The desire to be duped.
[01:53:54.832 --> 01:53:55.452]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:53:55.492 --> 01:53:56.033]  Let's talk about it.
[01:53:56.053 --> 01:53:56.313]  Here we go.
[01:54:01.644 --> 01:54:04.565]  Okay, that's Willie Nelson, you hear there in the music.
[01:54:06.725 --> 01:54:10.126]  He's scheduled to be on the show tomorrow, talk about a host of issues, you'll want to join us for that.
[01:54:10.566 --> 01:54:20.648]  We also have Naomi Wolf on, we'll have some serious questions for her, and another big guest who predicted all this oil information, and that of course will be Lindsey Williams.
[01:54:20.728 --> 01:54:21.968]  Huge show tomorrow.
[01:54:22.328 --> 01:54:24.629]  Before I go back to Webster Tarpley,
[01:54:26.658 --> 01:54:28.719]  I want to tell you about a few sponsors.
[01:54:28.759 --> 01:54:34.442]  Well, number one, the books and videos sold at Infowars.com make so much of this show possible.
[01:54:35.302 --> 01:54:38.964]  Another one is New Vitality, newvitality.com.
[01:54:39.745 --> 01:54:47.588]  You can call and get the aloe body cleanse, aloe vera and 29 other ingredients that are really known to detoxify and clean out your GI tract.
[01:54:48.749 --> 01:54:52.831]  New Vitality says all this well-documented, high-quality stuff.
[01:54:52.851 --> 01:54:53.051]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:54:53.671 --> 01:54:54.132]  Here's the number.
[01:54:54.152 --> 01:54:54.612]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:54:56.173 --> 01:55:02.596]  They have things like Super Beta Prostate, one of the best formulas out there, with the salt palm meadow and a bunch of other ingredients, scientifically proven.
[01:55:02.616 --> 01:55:07.418]  I mean, even mainline doctors prescribe it to shrink the prostate and health of that.
[01:55:07.438 --> 01:55:10.980]  1-800-569-4056 or newvitality.com.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.482]  If you forget it, the banner's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:55:16.522 --> 01:55:17.843]  And then another wonderful sponsor.
[01:55:20.017 --> 01:55:23.878]  It's not just that we have a storable foods sponsor, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:55:24.978 --> 01:55:30.200]  There's ways to store food in your own home and do it inexpensively from the store.
[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:34.821]  And they teach you the secrets of that at FoodShortageUSA.com.
[01:55:34.841 --> 01:55:39.522]  With all the craziness coming, it's smart to have some storable food farms, things like that.
[01:55:39.842 --> 01:55:41.462]  FoodShortageUSA.com.
[01:55:41.482 --> 01:55:42.583]  It's just FoodShortageUSA.com.
[01:55:43.903 --> 01:55:47.925]  You go there to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family.
[01:55:47.965 --> 01:55:49.105]  Prepare for the road ahead.
[01:55:49.165 --> 01:55:53.227]  This website reveals a step-by-step way for the average guy to get prepared for what's ahead.
[01:55:53.247 --> 01:55:57.729]  I think the best part about the system is it gets you off the food grid even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[01:55:57.989 --> 01:56:01.731]  The site is FoodShortageUSA.com or here's the number 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 877-327-0365
[01:56:11.195 --> 01:56:11.655]  Six-five.
[01:56:11.675 --> 01:56:16.997]  The key here is being self-sufficient, not being dependent on the system.
[01:56:18.218 --> 01:56:19.999]  Rebroadcast starts in about three minutes.
[01:56:20.019 --> 01:56:23.020]  We're going to finish up with Webster Tarpley, but Tex Marsh was on the show.
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:23.920]  A lot of key news.
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:29.462]  I also had Frank Caliendo, the big, one of the top comedians in the country on, doing George Bush imitations.
[01:56:29.702 --> 01:56:30.823]  The show starts with that.
[01:56:31.703 --> 01:56:35.845]  The very first minute of the show, so you'll want to tune in for that on the internet rebroadcast.
[01:56:35.865 --> 01:56:39.267]  Of course, stations re-air this on AM and FM dial across the country.
[01:56:39.647 --> 01:56:55.494]  But before you close out with the eugenicist, austerity, carbon movement for the banks, paid to them, in summation, the master plan that Obama is pushing, even more than McCain, which is more proof in the pudding, and has all the Wall Street funding, not McCain, more proof, tell us about your two books.
[01:56:56.448 --> 01:57:00.329]  Well, one is Obama, the post-modern coup, the making of a Manchurian candidate.
[01:57:00.409 --> 01:57:03.950]  That I believe you have in stock, so I urge people to get it from you.
[01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:20.775]  That's essentially the parallels to Carter, the matrix of Obama, the trilateral Bilderberg-Rand Corporation, and how the Obama campaign resembles nothing so much as the Orange Revolution in Ukraine back in 2004.
[01:57:21.075 --> 01:57:22.556]  And in the new book, quickly!
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:36.286]  Barack H. Obama, the unauthorized biography, the entire story, Foundation Operative, Poverty Pimp, Resco, Ouchi, Al-Samari, Ayers, Dorn, Wright, Amazon.com, and many other places.
[01:57:36.306 --> 01:57:37.806]  You've got about one minute left.
[01:57:37.886 --> 01:57:42.969]  Webster, again, the eugenicists, the carbon tax, explain to the left what this is.
[01:57:43.509 --> 01:57:49.171]  Well, the thing for the left, I think, if you're going to have Naomi there, you've got to ask her,
[01:57:50.742 --> 01:57:55.405]  What's the difference between a police state that's only top-down and a fascist regime?
[01:57:55.425 --> 01:57:57.827]  Because she's saying we're slipping into fascism.
[01:57:58.127 --> 01:58:03.450]  She talks about this as if this were purely a matter of the FBI and the National Security Agency.
[01:58:03.751 --> 01:58:15.198]  What about the hallmark of fascism, which is this movement that comes up from the gutter with left cover and radical cover and anti-authoritarian cover and pretends to be liberation from the old order?
[01:58:15.338 --> 01:58:16.039]  And that's fascism.
[01:58:17.173 --> 01:58:18.175]  And a carbon tax.
[01:58:18.996 --> 01:58:20.818]  And a carbon tax paid directly to the bankers.
[01:58:20.878 --> 01:58:23.162]  Webster, thank you so much for being on with us.
[01:58:23.442 --> 01:58:24.183]  My pleasure, always.
[01:58:24.624 --> 01:58:26.587]  Retransmission starts now at one place.
[01:58:26.807 --> 01:58:29.351]  PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com.
[01:58:29.371 --> 01:58:30.152]  Listen to the streams there.
[01:58:30.452 --> 01:58:31.974]  Frank Caliendo in one minute.
[01:58:32.155 --> 01:58:32.575]  Stay with us.
