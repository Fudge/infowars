[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.150]  Yeah, they build the big guns.
[00:00:04.511 --> 00:00:06.932]  Yeah, they build the death planes.
[00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.794]  Yeah, they build all the bombs.
[00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:15.656]  Yeah, they hide behind walls.
[00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:19.457]  Yeah, they hide behind desks.
[00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:25.940]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:50.896]  You that never done nothing But built to destroy You play with my world Like it's your little toy You put a gun in my hand And you hide from me
[00:00:54.341 --> 00:01:07.308]  Yeah, these old men that run the New World Order.
[00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:18.294]  Gary Reb gets a Pulitzer Prize for exposing the fact the CIA brings in narcotics and they double-tapped him in the head and said it was a suicide.
[00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.595]  They killed this local Palestinian activist.
[00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:26.165]  Cut him all up, duct-taped him, slaughtered him, and said it was a suicide.
[00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:31.069]  We talked to people, you know, the people that washed his body at the Muslim Center, he'd been tortured and cut to pieces.
[00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.477]  And we also had people at TV stations that heard the live feeds, and when the cops fished him out, they said, oh, this guy's been murdered, all cut up, hands, legs bound.
[00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:42.859]  George Humphrey's in the studio with us, and now Florida.
[00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.700]  Police believe suicide victim is DC Madam.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.583]  She had said on this show that, oh, Dick Cheney could have been one of my clients, but I'm not going to release that information.
[00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:53.783]  I'm going to go and fight this in court.
[00:01:54.203 --> 00:01:58.305]  And she threatened to release the names of the hundreds of big clients she had in DC.
[00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.887]  And man, they went ahead and convicted her, and there's no doubt they murdered her.
[00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:05.388]  On air in several interviews, and we have a small staff, but we're going to dig it out.
[00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:07.929]  Our listeners can go into the three interviews we had with her.
[00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.530]  We had the last one about a month ago.
[00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.231]  I'm going to air that in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[00:02:15.262 --> 00:02:17.864]  She was just absolutely clear.
[00:02:18.084 --> 00:02:19.184]  I will never commit suicide.
[00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:19.945]  I will fight this.
[00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.886]  If I'm convicted, I will not commit suicide.
[00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:22.947]  I will never kill myself.
[00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:25.208]  And she made that clear repeatedly.
[00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:29.291]  So listeners, go into the YouTube videos, the audios out there on the web.
[00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:30.311]  Help us find it.
[00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:31.032]  Call into the show.
[00:02:31.072 --> 00:02:31.672]  Tell us where it is.
[00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:33.333]  I got John Harmon trying to find it.
[00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:34.474]  I think it's in the last interview.
[00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:36.415]  I got people at the office trying to find it.
[00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:40.077]  I want to say again, I am not going to kill myself.
[00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:41.138]  I am not going to kill myself.
[00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:46.601]  George Humphrey, former City Council member, economist, author, documentary filmmaker.
[00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:49.703]  I've been fighting the New World Order for 15-plus years.
[00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:54.406]  Deborah Jean Palvery, we just learned right at the end of the last segment, is dead.
[00:02:54.446 --> 00:02:55.006]  Thanks for coming in.
[00:02:55.727 --> 00:02:57.868]  As always, it's great to be here.
[00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:06.854]  For those of you who are afraid to get involved in the fight against the New World Order because you might be ostracized or you might lose some friends,
[00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:08.314]  Get over it.
[00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:13.296]  There are so many vibrant, wonderful, alive people.
[00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:16.097]  Just coming to Alex's office.
[00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:17.617]  This is the Star Command.
[00:03:17.937 --> 00:03:20.318]  The energy here is so great.
[00:03:21.018 --> 00:03:23.399]  Alex, it is just such a pleasure to be here.
[00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.920]  Your passion for life.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.842]  Your passion for life is so wonderful.
[00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:33.705]  You know, sometimes you yell and scream and turn people off, but you know what?
[00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:36.187]  After they listen to you, they get into it.
[00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:40.571]  Well, I mean, people do instinctively know that I'm telling them the truth, and they check out the facts.
[00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.491]  Yeah.
[00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:45.014]  And I love life so much, I'm willing to give mine up for other people.
[00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:47.535]  Well, first of all, you're not going to be giving your life up.
[00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:53.776]  You're creating more life, and by, you know what, there is no defense against the New World Order.
[00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:58.938]  The only way to deal with this is to go forward, tell the truth, not be afraid.
[00:03:59.318 --> 00:04:06.000]  For those of you who are out there, there's nothing, I mean, you know, yeah, there are things to be afraid of, but don't be afraid.
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.982]  If we have it in our intention that we're going to win this thing, that we're going to turn this country around, is that we're going to restore
[00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.689]  The Constitution and the Republic.
[00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.390]  And I'm not talking about a utopia.
[00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.711]  We restore a good school system.
[00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.791]  We restore the environment.
[00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:31.093]  If we restore positive relationships between the police and the people, and the police actually become peace officers.
[00:04:33.234 --> 00:04:35.175]  We have sovereignty in our country again.
[00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:40.898]  We close our borders and we take care of our own people when we start manufacturing in this country again.
[00:04:41.358 --> 00:04:43.379]  These are things worth fighting for.
[00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:47.901]  I want to get into the positive area, but I know that Debra Jean Palfrey
[00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:51.444]  Would want us to expose the fact she was murdered.
[00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:51.704]  Absolutely.
[00:04:51.764 --> 00:04:55.987]  In fact, she said to me privately, and I know on air, that if she committed suicide, it was murder.
[00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:57.548]  She was murdered.
[00:04:57.968 --> 00:04:59.089]  She did not kill herself.
[00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:01.431]  And I'm telling you, I will never kill myself.
[00:05:01.631 --> 00:05:02.892]  And look, I'm not afraid of them killing me.
[00:05:03.372 --> 00:05:09.897]  But I am afraid of them shooting me in the back of the head, blowing my brains all over the walls when my family's out of town sometime, and saying I committed suicide.
[00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:15.461]  And I'm going to ask the Austin police, or if they kill me in New York or anywhere else, or any other patriot, please don't frame us.
[00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.443]  I mean, the hitmen come and kill us, and then you go along with it?
[00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:20.464]  I mean, that is so disgusting, George.
[00:05:20.484 --> 00:05:21.345]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:21.385 --> 00:05:24.788]  And I love your bravery.
[00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:28.971]  And the fact is, to be alive is to fight evil.
[00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:37.798]  And when these son-of-a-guns do stuff like this, and they've been doing it for such a long... I mean, they've been doing it for centuries.
[00:05:38.198 --> 00:05:39.659]  And just in the last 15 or 20 years, you know,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.721]  We're good to go.
[00:05:55.558 --> 00:06:00.544]  Shoulder to shoulder, and not ask or petition, but demand justice.
[00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:07.672]  And just like that fellow who was killed here in Austin not too long ago, he was a Palestinian.
[00:06:08.092 --> 00:06:13.218]  I don't know all the facts on that, but I have friends who are very good friends of his, and they said absolutely 100% he was murdered.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:27.196]  Oh no, I mean, they fished him out, just tortured to death, and bound hands, legs, mouth, and the first Austin Police was murdered, and the higher-ups, I mean, God!
[00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:30.239]  This is, you know, if you have this, there is
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.242]  Forensic evidence.
[00:06:32.302 --> 00:06:36.886]  You can't tie your hands up and duct tape yourself and do things like that.
[00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:40.669]  So it's pretty clear that there was foul play and murder on this.
[00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.476]  And the fact that there is not marching in the street, that there is just not massive response to this massive
[00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:53.320]  Injustice to this murder.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.587]  It's the same thing as King Edward I when he was killing the Scots back in the late 1200s.
[00:06:58.987 --> 00:07:01.350]  You know, we need people who are brave hearts.
[00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:07.959]  People like, you know, people like Alex Jones, and as importantly, to the people who are listening to this.
[00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.083]  Have a brave heart, and together we can stop this thing.
[00:07:13.103 --> 00:07:14.243]  Well, I want to be clear, George.
[00:07:14.263 --> 00:07:15.384]  With me, it's not even bravery.
[00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:19.928]  At my instinctive, spiritual, whatever core, I can't control myself.
[00:07:20.048 --> 00:07:20.708]  I hate bullies.
[00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:22.350]  I hate corrupt tyrants.
[00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:29.355]  I mean, the sterilization, the murder of Africans and Latin Americans and us, and all the eugenics they carry out against us.
[00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:30.396]  I mean, they hate life.
[00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:32.597]  They revel in hurting innocents.
[00:07:33.758 --> 00:07:39.702]  As you probably know, Mahatma Gandhi is one of my heroes, and I've spent a lot of time in India.
[00:07:40.082 --> 00:07:53.470]  But even Mahatma Gandhi, who was the king, the prince of non-violence, said, it is better to go to war with a gun in your hand to defend your country than to be a coward and say you believe in non-violent civil disobedience.
[00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.032]  We have to have courage to stand up against these rascals.
[00:07:57.432 --> 00:07:58.772]  Now, it's more sophisticated.
[00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:01.173]  I'm not saying you're wrong, but that's one section.
[00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:06.414]  It's kind of like the Bible says, a time to live, a time to die, a time to fight, a time to sow, a time to reap.
[00:08:07.354 --> 00:08:11.615]  You've got to know when it's time to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[00:08:11.935 --> 00:08:17.877]  I mean, when it was them peacefully being beaten by the British troops, that woke up people like George Orwell, who went back and wrote books about it.
[00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.779]  You know, he was one of those folks, guys.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.183]  You know, there's a time for that when they're provocateuring.
[00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:27.546]  That's why we don't go out and stage terror attacks, because they have to do it to blame it on us.
[00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:35.815]  But if they are trying to put us on flatback trucks, take us to FEMA camps, the preachers are all over saying, turn your guns in, go to the camp, take the shot, then you don't have a choice.
[00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:38.376]  Yeah, well by then it's too late.
[00:08:39.017 --> 00:08:39.837]  Now is the time.
[00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:48.942]  We have the beauty of a little bit of time right now to organize and first of all to educate ourselves, number one.
[00:08:49.223 --> 00:08:59.909]  Number two is to create community and reaching out to dozens and dozens of other people who feel the same way that you do and then to take steps
[00:09:00.549 --> 00:09:22.001]  To get into the government, to get to your city council members, to get to your county commissioners, to talk to your sheriff, to talk to people who are in other positions of power, and to demand, not ask, but to demand true justice and to stop this unbelievable, just unbelievable slave mentality
[00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:25.009]  That we are experiencing.
[00:09:25.049 --> 00:09:30.371]  Let me talk to John real fast, because the network selectively erases about 1 out of 20 of my shows from some glitch.
[00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:33.851]  Tell me Murphy's Law that that last interview isn't erased.
[00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:34.512]  I got it.
[00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:35.332]  You got it, good.
[00:09:35.612 --> 00:09:36.292]  Are you listening to it?
[00:09:36.312 --> 00:09:37.872]  Did she say that I won't commit suicide?
[00:09:38.052 --> 00:09:38.793]  Yep, I got that.
[00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:39.513]  We have that.
[00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:40.713]  Can you cue that up, please?
[00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:42.053]  Yeah, let me transfer it over.
[00:09:42.413 --> 00:09:43.394]  Oh, he's transferring it over.
[00:09:43.574 --> 00:09:44.074]  Oh, God.
[00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:44.654]  I just...
[00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:47.806]  It's getting so obvious, George.
[00:09:48.006 --> 00:09:53.153]  I mean, it's just... It's been obvious for the last 20 years.
[00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:56.637]  I mean, it just gets more and more and more and more obvious.
[00:09:56.697 --> 00:10:05.247]  The Palestinian school teacher, Mr. Hamad, no criminal record, been wounded over there protesting in Palestine, giving him school books.
[00:10:05.848 --> 00:10:08.030]  Oh, he was beloved at his school.
[00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.535]  But I've now talked to his neighbors, I've now talked to people that knew him, talked to his best friend, his treasure.
[00:10:12.795 --> 00:10:16.259]  There were Israelis running around with machine guns, talking to neighbors.
[00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.661]  They wanted him to know they were there.
[00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:19.603]  This is in the weeks before he was killed.
[00:10:20.103 --> 00:10:26.450]  I mean, my God, are they going to have Israelis shoot me in my yard in front of witnesses and then the media will say I killed myself?
[00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.551]  I mean, what does it take?
[00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:35.979]  Well, they caught a truckload of Israelis the day after 9-11 in Ohio with plans to blow up a nuclear power plant down in Florida.
[00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:37.240]  They also caught some in Tennessee.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.321]  They caught them in Mexico City.
[00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:40.343]  And they were here without permits.
[00:10:40.464 --> 00:10:42.385]  They were on illegal passports.
[00:10:42.826 --> 00:10:46.870]  And lo and behold, they got a free trip back to lovely Israel.
[00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.511]  Friends, you know, I am not for or against any of the religions.
[00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:54.632]  I'm a friend to all of them, and I'm open to Israel.
[00:10:54.693 --> 00:10:59.394]  But, you know, if you don't understand is that the Mossad controls this country.
[00:10:59.514 --> 00:11:00.534]  It's just a fact.
[00:11:00.955 --> 00:11:04.736]  And unless we boot these son of a guns out, they're going to continue to play their games.
[00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:08.437]  Well, I mean, killing people in Austin, it's out of control.
[00:11:08.837 --> 00:11:11.058]  Yeah!
[00:11:11.118 --> 00:11:16.721]  By the way, I got death threats that night, and they went in on my Wikipedia and said I'd committed suicide on my Wikipedia.
[00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:27.605]  Yeah, you know that for the last 10-12 years I've been talking to you about, you know, we've been talking together about the Mossad and how unbelievably powerful they are.
[00:11:27.765 --> 00:11:29.467]  No, no, I have never debated it.
[00:11:29.527 --> 00:11:30.628]  Yeah, you've never debated it.
[00:11:31.229 --> 00:11:40.080]  I've just simply not myopically, because there's a lot of people that are... It's easy to get off on a tangent and think that somebody's anti-Jewish or anything like that.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.923]  Well, it also gives our enemies ways to twist.
[00:11:43.283 --> 00:11:47.104]  It's effective just to get the message out about the New Order, but since we bring that up, I want to get back to her.
[00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:49.544]  And if it was Eskimos, we'd be saying the same thing.
[00:11:49.604 --> 00:11:59.326]  And the fact is, it's this one group of people from this one nation, and they have inordinate power in our country, and what they're doing is that they're just sucking this country dry.
[00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:01.767]  Well, I want to expand on that.
[00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:04.167]  People know my analogy on this.
[00:12:04.187 --> 00:12:06.188]  It's like if you have five guys that rob a bank.
[00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:12.236]  Okay, and one of them's a German, one of them's a Jew, one of them's an Italian, one of them's an Eskimo, like you said.
[00:12:12.256 --> 00:12:13.976]  One of them's a Kibler Elf.
[00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:23.981]  It doesn't give any one group cover to say there are other groups in the hierarchy.
[00:12:24.762 --> 00:12:26.042]  I mean, how do you square this?
[00:12:26.363 --> 00:12:28.584]  And I've got Tex Marr is coming in tomorrow.
[00:12:28.604 --> 00:12:29.544]  I'm going to bring this up to him.
[00:12:29.604 --> 00:12:31.545]  He focuses mainly on Israel now.
[00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:33.006]  I think that's important work.
[00:12:33.426 --> 00:12:34.166]  I've also got
[00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:38.771]  Michael Hoffman on for two hours Friday, focusing on that.
[00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:39.853]  I mean, we're bringing these subjects up.
[00:12:39.873 --> 00:12:44.258]  We always have had Tex Mars, and we've always had Gaylord Ross, and I've always had you on.
[00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:46.281]  There's no censorship, as others have claimed.
[00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:51.487]  I just have a wide show that covers a huge spectrum, but I want to be key.
[00:12:51.808 --> 00:12:53.950]  I mean, I want to be very specific on this key point.
[00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:56.952]  How do you square the eugenicists?
[00:12:57.032 --> 00:13:00.695]  Because people say that I talk about Nazis all the time.
[00:13:00.995 --> 00:13:02.236]  Prescott Bush was a Nazi.
[00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:03.797]  Bush Sr.
[00:13:03.837 --> 00:13:04.958]  did run the eugenics program.
[00:13:04.978 --> 00:13:07.660]  They did sign China on IMF World Bank money to do that.
[00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:10.162]  They do love Arnold.
[00:13:11.763 --> 00:13:18.668]  So all I've ever pointed out, and there are a lot of people who love Hitler, they email me, they post on the message board, they say, don't talk about Hitler, he was good.
[00:13:19.328 --> 00:13:20.309]  I know too much history.
[00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:22.771]  I'm not even talking about skewed histories, I mean the real history.
[00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:27.494]  I mean, Lord Milner wrote that they set Hitler up out of England to tear Europe up.
[00:13:27.514 --> 00:13:28.154]  He didn't know that.
[00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:28.975]  He was a wind-up toy.
[00:13:29.315 --> 00:13:31.356]  They put the Communist in.
[00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:41.202]  All these top globalists write books, and later they get declassified or in policy reports or Carnegie Endowment documents, that they are in control of all the groups.
[00:13:41.462 --> 00:13:44.644]  Just like this top globalist puts a book out saying, we run all the major groups.
[00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.346]  So then it doesn't even become about this group or that group.
[00:13:48.626 --> 00:13:51.368]  Just the entire power structure is run.
[00:13:51.388 --> 00:13:51.748]  But is Israel
[00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:54.290]  Hyper-dominant, is it?
[00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:04.754]  One of the top three, you know, all-penultimate, it's like co-equal power with the British Anglo-American power axis, which is basically Rothschild-run.
[00:14:05.394 --> 00:14:14.178]  Is that merged in with this whole, I mean, it's an amalgamation of this Germanic death cult, Illuminati, which goes back to Kabbalah itself, and that back to Egypt.
[00:14:14.598 --> 00:14:16.679]  And we've had the top experts like Hoffman on about this.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.288]  And so for me, it's that Egyptian dark magic system.
[00:14:22.308 --> 00:14:24.091]  Whether you believe it or not, that's what they believe.
[00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:24.531]  George Humphrey.
[00:14:25.276 --> 00:14:31.681]  Well, you've brought up just a ton of issues, and we just don't have the time to go into each, and being very articulate about this.
[00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:35.905]  But I mean, I'm not supposed to talk about how Hitler did satanic rituals when it's admitted.
[00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.827]  I'm not supposed to say that there's a cult going on at Bohemian Grove.
[00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:39.988]  Well, there's cults all over.
[00:14:40.028 --> 00:14:42.931]  Yeah, but that's my point, is that there's more to it.
[00:14:43.131 --> 00:14:44.492]  You know, there's another level.
[00:14:44.512 --> 00:14:50.097]  I mean, why did Henry Ford, why did the IBM, why is IBM funding all this now when they were Nazis?
[00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:55.198]  I'm just saying, why did the Zionists fund Hitler and do deals with him?
[00:14:55.518 --> 00:14:57.419]  You see, I'm saying there's another level.
[00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:06.802]  Oh, there's so many levels, and that's why information is so important, and just to keep digging and digging and digging.
[00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:11.323]  And again, I don't care whether they're Eskimos or, you know, from Australia.
[00:15:13.664 --> 00:15:17.589]  It is true to say that the Nazis almost overthrew the U.S.
[00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:21.693]  in the 30s, and Smedley Butler, two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, went public and exposed it.
[00:15:22.274 --> 00:15:28.861]  But that wasn't the Nazis, that was the Anglo-American eugenicist, which the Rothschilds contribute to.
[00:15:29.622 --> 00:15:33.304]  That's what I'm saying, is that Hitler, the evidence is, was a grandson of a Rothschild.
[00:15:33.564 --> 00:15:35.806]  So I'm saying there's another level here, George.
[00:15:35.826 --> 00:15:41.329]  Well, they're collectivists, whether they're communist or fascist, they're collectivists.
[00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:51.154]  And no matter what the name, is that there are these group of people who want to centralize power under their chosen people, and to control us.
[00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:55.997]  And that's why we're here, that's why we're fighting this stuff, that's why we're exposing it.
[00:15:56.357 --> 00:16:03.599]  Whether it's the Zionists, or the Nazis, or the British Royal Family, they all believe they have the super genes, they're the master race.
[00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:11.881]  Old Testament, we need to go in and commit genocide, to take over the promised land, and just like, exactly, that's what we're dealing with here.
[00:16:12.641 --> 00:16:16.802]  Well, that's why we're here, and I'll tell you what.
[00:16:18.473 --> 00:16:31.150]  With this radio interview that you have on this woman, I think it's really going to put a good spin on it, and I sure hope that we can get some national publication on this thing, because she, just like John Tower, John Tower was killed.
[00:16:31.771 --> 00:16:34.735]  That's one of the things that most people in Texas are not aware of.
[00:16:34.735 --> 00:16:35.675]  They blew his plane up!
[00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:38.516]  They sure did, and they blew his buddy's plane up two days before.
[00:16:38.816 --> 00:16:44.017]  I mean, this guy is a 24-year-old, 24-year-old senior U.S.
[00:16:44.057 --> 00:16:51.838]  Senator, and he was absolutely assassinated, and it got three minutes on national news, and it was put away.
[00:16:51.958 --> 00:17:01.700]  You know, most Texans have no idea that their own United States Senator was assassinated, just like most people in Minnesota don't know that Paul Wellstone was assassinated.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.704]  You know, as Alex is saying, this stuff is very, very, very serious.
[00:17:06.924 --> 00:17:15.391]  You know, they've got the velvet glove on, but they're starting to take the velvet glove off, and it's time to wake up to this first... Well, I just want to say this.
[00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:26.740]  We need to list all the globalists, have their names out there so they can be punished for what they've done, and, you know, they're losing their soft power, and there was a reason their older, more sophisticated predecessors had soft power.
[00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:28.922]  You guys really want to get into a hot war?
[00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:29.723]  It's not going to be pretty.
[00:17:31.195 --> 00:17:33.997]  So Alex, do you think we're going to bomb Iran in the next couple weeks?
[00:17:34.237 --> 00:17:34.618]  I don't know.
[00:17:34.658 --> 00:17:39.161]  I've got a guest actually coming up in the fourth hour to talk about that, but let's get your take on the other side.
[00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:41.042]  Deborah Jean Palfrey, the D.C.
[00:17:41.082 --> 00:17:45.105]  Madam, said here that she would never commit suicide, that if she dies they would murder her.
[00:17:45.706 --> 00:17:46.647]  Well, they've murdered her.
[00:17:46.687 --> 00:17:48.008]  We've got that audio coming up.
[00:17:48.348 --> 00:17:48.748]  Stay with us.
[00:17:50.189 --> 00:17:52.271]  And we're going to go over now on our video feed.
[00:17:54.749 --> 00:18:01.593]  Let's continue here until we come back in a few minutes, because now what I do is sometimes, if we're really on a hot subject, we just continue.
[00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:07.097]  George, you've known me even before I was on TV.
[00:18:07.257 --> 00:18:12.080]  I remember 15 years ago, delivering political signs to your house, because we were for the same political people.
[00:18:13.281 --> 00:18:14.061]  Buchanan and folks.
[00:18:15.742 --> 00:18:17.323]  You've been fighting the New World Order for a long time.
[00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:19.885]  You know I do all this legitimately.
[00:18:19.925 --> 00:18:20.966]  I do this because I believe it.
[00:18:21.006 --> 00:18:21.686]  I'm the real deal.
[00:18:21.706 --> 00:18:22.107]  So are you.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.341]  I have a lot of different camps.
[00:18:24.381 --> 00:18:26.503]  The camps that want to say it's all the Catholics that run it.
[00:18:26.843 --> 00:18:28.424]  Or the camps that want to say it's all the Jews.
[00:18:28.824 --> 00:18:32.247]  And they're little enclaves and they're very hateful.
[00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:35.530]  And they've all been unfair about what I've really talked about here on air.
[00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.511]  Like, I've exposed the Catholic Church being New World Order.
[00:18:37.611 --> 00:18:38.552]  And the Jesuits, yeah.
[00:18:38.752 --> 00:18:43.177]  And then they say I have it, it doesn't matter how many guests I have on, it just doesn't matter if I can do ten shows on it.
[00:18:43.217 --> 00:18:53.409]  Just like right now, I'm talking about this with you, and there's no censorship, but because I don't like Hitler, and they email me, they say, Hitler was good, you're a lying Jew, and I'm not Jewish, it wouldn't be bad if I was.
[00:18:53.809 --> 00:19:10.577]  You know, the point is that it's a tribalism and it's mindlessness and it just turns into an obsession where they never wake anybody up, they never go out and have rallies, they never go out and fight an issue, they never go out and expose any of the New World Order operations, so they just literally
[00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:16.000]  They even fight with each other, like the Jews run it all crowd, have like a hundred groups all fighting with each other.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.681]  Half their work is fighting with each other about who's right.
[00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:21.083]  Same thing with the Catholics run it all crowd.
[00:19:21.343 --> 00:19:24.464]  And I'm sorry, I've read too many of their own internal documents that have come out.
[00:19:24.605 --> 00:19:32.829]  I know that to them it is a psychological warfare methodology, and they have different sub-gangs that work for them.
[00:19:32.869 --> 00:19:37.592]  They'll use the Nazis, they'll use the Communists, they'll use the Jews, they'll use the Italian Mafia.
[00:19:38.092 --> 00:19:42.335]  And I see the New World Order actually pushing a lot of this.
[00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:46.858]  I believe that they want to actually have a rise of anti-Semitism.
[00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:51.722]  Well, the definition of a patriot firing squad is a circle.
[00:19:52.122 --> 00:20:06.816]  And if we really, truly, truly, truly want to restore the Republic and restore freedom and restore the environment and restore a semblance of culture in this country, is that we have to keep, as Jesse Jackson says, we have to keep our eye on the prize.
[00:20:06.856 --> 00:20:08.358]  We need to start working together.
[00:20:08.738 --> 00:20:10.660]  And I'll tell you what, I've made it my
[00:20:11.801 --> 00:20:15.724]  Deal to be friends with everybody and not go out and attack anybody.
[00:20:15.824 --> 00:20:18.767]  You know, I disagree with almost everybody on some issues.
[00:20:18.907 --> 00:20:25.192]  Exactly, and so you don't obsess like a crazy person and start just saying lies about people.
[00:20:25.312 --> 00:20:28.114]  I've dealt with this for so long.
[00:20:28.154 --> 00:20:31.177]  People tell me, why don't you interview this guy, you know, the head Catholic.
[00:20:31.457 --> 00:20:32.338]  The guy says the earth
[00:20:33.438 --> 00:20:35.419]  is the center of the universe and is on a string.
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.081]  And that flying saucers drop nuclear bombs.
[00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:39.622]  I mean, I just can't be part of it.
[00:20:40.162 --> 00:20:42.363]  I mean, I can't have every cult leader on.
[00:20:42.383 --> 00:20:44.844]  Well, Alex, you are live right now.
[00:20:44.884 --> 00:20:45.425]  Here we go.
[00:20:45.905 --> 00:20:48.166]  And get the video tools you need for the information war.
[00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:50.047]  We have a plan to take back our government.
[00:20:50.067 --> 00:20:52.428]  Let's get into what you just said about Iran.
[00:20:57.271 --> 00:20:58.832]  We're going to get into Iran.
[00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:02.926]  We're going to do that in the next segment, actually.
[00:21:02.946 --> 00:21:05.229]  This is a short segment right now with George Humphrey.
[00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.891]  FairerLove.com.
[00:21:07.973 --> 00:21:09.895]  Filmmaker, multi-time author.
[00:21:10.977 --> 00:21:13.500]  But right now, I want to play Deborah Jean Palfrey.
[00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:15.443]  This is her on the show.
[00:21:15.803 --> 00:21:17.505]  What was the date on the show on the last interview with her?
[00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:19.006]  March 13th, 08.
[00:21:19.626 --> 00:21:20.887]  March 13th, 08.
[00:21:21.287 --> 00:21:23.087]  So this is... Recent.
[00:21:23.627 --> 00:21:25.407]  Yeah, this is like a month and a half ago.
[00:21:26.248 --> 00:21:29.388]  And it's now May 1st, and she's clearly committed suicide on May 1st.
[00:21:30.048 --> 00:21:33.849]  And folks, they've got microwave residence systems where Mama's out.
[00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:34.809]  She's with Mama.
[00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:36.669]  They hit her for 10 seconds, she's dead.
[00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.650]  They got stuff where they can walk up and pat you on the shoulder and you're dead.
[00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.391]  They got little bitty micro darts that dissolve.
[00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:43.851]  You think a mosquito bites you and you die.
[00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:44.811]  They had that 30 years ago.
[00:21:45.231 --> 00:21:50.434]  They had declassified in the 70s, by the 50s, fast-acting cancers that kill you in a month.
[00:21:50.955 --> 00:21:52.235]  I mean, they have got it all.
[00:21:52.516 --> 00:21:57.038]  Let's go ahead and play her, the clip of her, the clearly murdered, ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
[00:21:57.719 --> 00:22:05.003]  Well, the fact that you're so visible really protects you going on Larry King and other big shows, but you want to put it on record that you're not planning to commit suicide?
[00:22:05.564 --> 00:22:07.485]  No, I'm not planning to commit suicide.
[00:22:07.505 --> 00:22:12.408]  I'm planning to go into court on April 7th if indeed we do have the trial, and I do
[00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:22.757]  I plan on defending myself vigorously, and I plan on exposing the government in ways that, you know, I do not think they want me to expose them.
[00:22:22.897 --> 00:22:26.738]  I want them to explain to me in open court why they came after me.
[00:22:27.018 --> 00:22:28.298]  How does the FBI do this?
[00:22:28.358 --> 00:22:35.480]  They know you had a bunch of, you know, government and cabinet and White House and Defense Department people, and they don't go after any of them.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.521]  They go after you, and then instead of just dropping and leaving you alone,
[00:22:41.155 --> 00:22:43.679]  They've made a huge mess out of this.
[00:22:44.099 --> 00:22:45.942]  What I think happened is that they used me.
[00:22:46.463 --> 00:22:47.364]  I was a hunting ground.
[00:22:47.444 --> 00:22:49.827]  I keep using that term because I think it's so applicable.
[00:22:49.887 --> 00:22:50.608]  I was a hunting ground.
[00:22:50.949 --> 00:22:52.591]  They thought I had something perhaps.
[00:22:53.123 --> 00:22:54.744]  They were watching me for years.
[00:22:54.884 --> 00:22:56.525]  Again, they were not watching me for a few months.
[00:22:56.545 --> 00:22:58.866]  They were watching me for anywhere from two and a half to six years.
[00:22:58.886 --> 00:23:00.847]  I was a very routine person.
[00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:05.070]  All of a sudden, here I go, and I abruptly quit the business.
[00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.652]  Now, if you're watching me from afar, this could be in a very Hoover-esque-like fashion.
[00:23:09.932 --> 00:23:11.213]  This could be very alarming.
[00:23:11.273 --> 00:23:12.694]  She shuts down the business.
[00:23:13.034 --> 00:23:13.974]  She's selling her house.
[00:23:14.015 --> 00:23:14.555]  She's moving.
[00:23:14.575 --> 00:23:16.136]  Oh, my God, what's going on?
[00:23:16.756 --> 00:23:18.657]  They've come flying out here to California.
[00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.859]  And it was tipped off, by the way, by a wire transfer from my bank.
[00:23:22.685 --> 00:23:23.406]  That's right.
[00:23:23.426 --> 00:23:25.368]  We're spying on everybody.
[00:23:25.408 --> 00:23:26.570]  Final segment with our guest.
[00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.892]  She's the DC Madame Jean Palfrey.
[00:23:29.453 --> 00:23:30.214]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:30.835]  This goes deep.
[00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:36.063]  It does go deep, and at the end of the show today, I'm going to air the whole interview.
[00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:43.708]  It's about 20 minutes long, and over the next few weeks, I will air the other two lengthy, hour-long interviews with Debra Jean Palin-Freeh, unless the network's erased them again.
[00:23:44.509 --> 00:23:46.190]  But not John's fault, though.
[00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:52.514]  I mean, so much is going on, so much is happening, and I think in that same interview, see if you can find it, John.
[00:23:52.554 --> 00:23:53.575]  He's just a superstar.
[00:23:53.595 --> 00:23:54.716]  He does a job with 10 guys.
[00:23:55.216 --> 00:23:56.397]  See if you can find it where I said,
[00:23:57.057 --> 00:24:03.980]  You know, Dick Cheney, and she says, hmm, maybe Dick Cheney, and she had said, I'm going to release the big names if you're a hypocrite and send me to jail.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:12.484]  And I guarantee you, they had her house bugged, they had her phone bugged, they had her mom's house bugged, they used her cell phone to listen to you even when it's off, and the minute she said, I'm going to go public,
[00:24:13.444 --> 00:24:22.050]  The minute she said that, that's the type of thing that would get a helicopter to come in here and shoot rockets into this office, and it wouldn't matter what the people across the street saw.
[00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.490]  The government does stuff like that.
[00:24:24.131 --> 00:24:27.793]  Say if Palfrey, this is the kind of dangerous stuff I do, this is what will get me killed about anything it ever does.
[00:24:29.214 --> 00:24:33.097]  Palfrey calls here, decides to go on air with the big names.
[00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:36.716]  Okay, they would have a hit team en route to kill her.
[00:24:37.036 --> 00:24:39.118]  And they were unable to kill her before she went on the show.
[00:24:39.138 --> 00:24:39.819]  And they'd gun her down.
[00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:40.980]  It wouldn't even matter that she had ganged at it.
[00:24:41.441 --> 00:24:43.182]  They would cut the power off at my office.
[00:24:44.414 --> 00:24:48.435]  And then if I had been told by her what it was, they would just run over me in the street.
[00:24:49.335 --> 00:24:51.416]  Cops jump out, black uniform, shoot me, wouldn't matter.
[00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.456]  The news would say I shot myself in the front parking lot.
[00:24:53.836 --> 00:24:55.217]  They don't care anymore.
[00:24:55.417 --> 00:24:55.937]  George Humphrey.
[00:24:56.257 --> 00:24:59.518]  Well, it must be remembered, this has gone way, way, way back.
[00:24:59.718 --> 00:25:07.120]  It's pretty evident that they did the same thing to Marilyn Monroe, is that she was having a lot of trouble and she was going to go public with her affairs.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.201]  And now there's a black and white film that's confirmed with a man sodomizing her.
[00:25:11.949 --> 00:25:14.171]  Yeah, and also... They're using that to blackmail the Kennedys.
[00:25:14.231 --> 00:25:19.876]  ...is that there are several women that have been associated with Bill Clinton who also, uh, archicided themselves.
[00:25:20.256 --> 00:25:25.681]  So this is nothing new, and it just, but it's, it's today, and it's right now, and it needs to stop.
[00:25:25.881 --> 00:25:30.385]  Well, the archicides, I mean, they'd cut your arms, legs, and head off and say you killed yourself.
[00:25:30.485 --> 00:25:31.726]  Yep.
[00:25:34.208 --> 00:25:35.529]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:25:35.589 --> 00:25:38.832]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:25:43.314 --> 00:25:44.715]  It is a big idea.
[00:25:44.735 --> 00:25:46.857]  A New World Order.
[00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:51.941]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:25:52.441 --> 00:25:55.244]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:25:55.284 --> 00:25:57.526]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:25:58.066 --> 00:26:00.508]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:26:01.249 --> 00:26:08.575]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:26:11.593 --> 00:26:16.556]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:26:17.037 --> 00:26:20.499]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:26:20.899 --> 00:26:23.401]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:24.442]  Most people have no idea.
[00:26:24.462 --> 00:26:25.402]  They're not after money.
[00:26:25.422 --> 00:26:26.523]  They have all the money they need.
[00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:27.304]  They're after power.
[00:26:27.324 --> 00:26:28.384]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:47.362]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:47.842 --> 00:26:50.606]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:57.279 --> 00:27:01.463]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:27:02.124 --> 00:27:02.944]  You want answers?
[00:27:03.685 --> 00:27:04.626]  Well, so does he.
[00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:08.850]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.514]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.545]  Deborah Jean Palfrey, headline, PrisonPlanet.com, exclusive, D.C.
[00:27:37.585 --> 00:27:39.307]  madam predicted she would be suicided.
[00:27:39.927 --> 00:27:43.671]  Rape beating, maiming, disfigurement, and more than likely murder.
[00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:48.288]  Disguised in the form of just another jailhouse accident or suicide would await me.
[00:27:48.608 --> 00:27:56.429]  So not only did she say here that they might kill her, or that she would never commit suicide, she said it in writings.
[00:27:57.249 --> 00:28:00.690]  You've taken into custody my physical safety and most probably my very life would be in jeopardy.
[00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:01.650]  She wrote in 91.
[00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.131]  Okay, it just goes on.
[00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:09.592]  Folks, bottom line, she, and I want the government to know,
[00:28:11.863 --> 00:28:13.564]  I know you got the phones all tapped, so it doesn't matter.
[00:28:13.584 --> 00:28:14.464]  You have recordings of it.
[00:28:16.485 --> 00:28:19.366]  She never told me that she had sex with Dick Cheney.
[00:28:19.746 --> 00:28:20.847]  She implied that to the media.
[00:28:20.887 --> 00:28:21.747]  She implied that here.
[00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:23.868]  She said she might bring it out if they didn't leave her alone.
[00:28:23.928 --> 00:28:24.568]  It was hypocritical.
[00:28:25.569 --> 00:28:28.870]  We know there's already senators and other people she was with and the heads of, you know, agencies.
[00:28:30.311 --> 00:28:32.372]  But, you know, that she sent women to.
[00:28:33.965 --> 00:28:35.066]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:28:35.266 --> 00:28:37.906]  So we just played that clip of her earlier, we'll play more of the interview coming up.
[00:28:38.407 --> 00:28:41.608]  George, I want to get into Iran and a bunch of other issues, but this is big, this is breaking.
[00:28:42.668 --> 00:28:52.631]  I also want to talk about this globalist writing a big book, former head of Kissinger Associates, that's very high powered as you know, saying, yeah, we run things, we're going to take the internet away from you, just as I said they would with internet too.
[00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:55.754]  I could talk all day and all tomorrow and for the next week about what you're talking about.
[00:29:12.372 --> 00:29:38.659]  I want to thank you for having G. Edward Griffin on your show the other day, and he was here in town the other day, and he is another fine, fine gentleman who is talking about and informing people in very, very intelligent and clear ways about the reality of what is going on, and providing us, just like you are, ways that we as individuals, instead of feeling disempowered or disconnected,
[00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:39.239]  I think so.
[00:30:00.639 --> 00:30:06.165]  They always talk about the Mayan calendars 2012, and I don't know how much stock I put into that.
[00:30:06.205 --> 00:30:07.967]  It's a nice symbology.
[00:30:08.267 --> 00:30:14.133]  But if you look at the Gregorian, the changes that Pope Gregory made, 2012 is right now.
[00:30:14.513 --> 00:30:17.076]  We're right in the middle of it on a symbolic level.
[00:30:18.197 --> 00:30:20.980]  The Shinola has hit the fan folks.
[00:30:22.801 --> 00:30:28.767]  Hillary Clinton running for president says that she's the peace candidate, but that she wants to up the war in Afghanistan.
[00:30:29.548 --> 00:30:35.694]  We just had more casualties in Iraq this last month than we have for last year.
[00:30:35.714 --> 00:30:44.282]  It is very, very obvious that the crazies that are controlling the White House right now are doing everything that they can
[00:30:44.722 --> 00:30:50.326]  To create a situation in which we go in, right now, in the next couple weeks, in Bob Moran.
[00:30:50.526 --> 00:31:02.853]  I don't think it's going to happen, because I don't even think with their insane, insane minds, that they're going to do it, because they don't have the troops, and even if you level Tehran, they're not going to give up.
[00:31:02.933 --> 00:31:05.755]  And Tehran is a very, very different deal.
[00:31:05.795 --> 00:31:07.296]  It's three times larger than Iraq.
[00:31:08.737 --> 00:31:29.586]  There's, you know, many more people, and they're Persians instead of Arabs, and they're much better educated people, and there is no way in the world, and besides that, both China and Russia, both China and Russia, both of which have the big one, have been getting real, real close with Tehran in the last year and a half.
[00:31:30.146 --> 00:31:33.928]  And I'll tell you what, Putin is an amazing guy.
[00:31:33.988 --> 00:31:38.190]  He is really standing up to Bush these last couple of years.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.686]  Even though the Carnegie Endowment on Peace basically runs Russia, I think there's another level to it.
[00:31:42.787 --> 00:31:46.673]  There's levels within levels within levels.
[00:31:46.853 --> 00:31:49.778]  On my streams, we're going to just continue at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:49.798 --> 00:31:51.361]  We'll be right back with everybody else in three minutes.
[00:31:56.012 --> 00:32:08.899]  George continuing, I'm not disagreeing with you that Putin's seized some of the oligarch's money, he's arrested like three of them, and every time it comes out in the news, well the Rothschilds really owned it, so the person he arrested was just a front.
[00:32:08.919 --> 00:32:15.302]  Of course the Rothschilds are just financing McCain, and financing Hillary, both, and Obama, but they don't exist.
[00:32:15.722 --> 00:32:17.763]  As some newspapers say, they don't even exist, they're not real.
[00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:21.972]  Well, everything is an illusion.
[00:32:22.032 --> 00:32:32.078]  As Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in 1937, he said, nothing happens in Washington or around the world without the inter-elite making it happen.
[00:32:32.538 --> 00:32:44.705]  And if that happened in 1937, the technology has increased a thousandfold, and quite clearly the centralization of the technology through the NSA and CIA and all the other
[00:32:45.485 --> 00:33:11.050]  uh... alphabet agencies is increased and the power of the of the people of power the middle class is decreased relatively but but but there are still nationalists that are left in in in the old soviet union in russia and it's my belief and i hope i'm correct is that they have the the predominant ear of putin right now putin's walking a fine line between the rothschilds
[00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:26.955]  and and the nationalists there and remember is that the ashkenazis went after russia the first time they they they they targeted russia because the roman office and i'm not supporting any of the well i'm not taking sides on this but the roman office would never let
[00:33:28.755 --> 00:33:34.020]  The Rothschilds come in and take over their banking system, and that is why Russia got hacked first.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.541]  Well, that's why Serbia just got attacked.
[00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:36.502]  It was a leftover.
[00:33:36.783 --> 00:33:44.170]  I mean, they told them, the IMF said, let us run your bank, and take our private central bank, and they had their own factories, own system.
[00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.332]  I mean, Europeans were vacationing there.
[00:33:47.273 --> 00:33:50.057]  Look, the 66 rogue nations are any nation they don't own.
[00:33:50.477 --> 00:33:56.585]  And just them coming in and saying, oh, Kosovo is an independent nation now.
[00:33:56.965 --> 00:34:01.471]  This is unbelievable that this was allowed to happen.
[00:34:01.491 --> 00:34:03.093]  And they used, again, Al Qaeda.
[00:34:03.954 --> 00:34:10.338]  To attack Al Zohari, the number two in Al Qaeda, who now says 9-11 truthers work for the Iranians.
[00:34:10.779 --> 00:34:14.061]  I mean, just putting out CIA statements... It's laughable.
[00:34:14.081 --> 00:34:16.943]  He admittedly was commanding forces for the CIA.
[00:34:17.103 --> 00:34:17.663]  That's admitted!
[00:34:18.004 --> 00:34:20.625]  And we're not talking about in the 80s, we're talking about in 1998, 1999, 1997 in Serbia.
[00:34:24.528 --> 00:34:35.672]  Yeah, and I was in Croatia this last summer, and other parts of Europe and Eastern Europe, and the people there have a much, much higher awareness of what is going on.
[00:34:35.712 --> 00:34:37.153]  They see through this whole deal.
[00:34:37.213 --> 00:34:42.175]  They understand that the power elite, the Rothschilds, you know, whatever name you want to put on this.
[00:34:42.215 --> 00:34:42.635]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:42.675 --> 00:34:44.336]  Hold on, we've got to go back live on the main network.
[00:34:46.497 --> 00:34:47.077]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:47.097 --> 00:34:47.497]  Stay with us.
[00:34:47.517 --> 00:34:47.717]  Here we go.
[00:34:57.196 --> 00:34:57.836]  Big Brother.
[00:34:58.497 --> 00:34:59.558]  Mainstream media.
[00:35:00.278 --> 00:35:01.379]  Government cover-ups.
[00:35:02.019 --> 00:35:02.860]  You want answers?
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.461]  Well, so does he.
[00:35:05.161 --> 00:35:08.783]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:09.364 --> 00:35:13.466]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:14.927 --> 00:35:16.428]  Look at the size of that thing!
[00:35:18.469 --> 00:35:19.790]  Cut the chatter red, too.
[00:35:20.951 --> 00:35:25.433]  Lock your X-foils in attack position while I cut across their axes and draw their fire.
[00:35:26.861 --> 00:35:28.902]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are fighting the New World Order.
[00:35:28.922 --> 00:35:30.142]  They're killing us left and right.
[00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:33.363]  But they're getting exposed all over the world.
[00:35:34.323 --> 00:35:37.224]  Major issues are developing everywhere.
[00:35:37.364 --> 00:35:41.525]  News is coming in so fast.
[00:35:43.206 --> 00:35:45.586]  Brandi Britton found dead in her Baltimore home.
[00:35:50.468 --> 00:35:51.248]  Brandi Britton
[00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.491]  She worked for Palfrey.
[00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:00.333]  No, I know, I, I, oh my God.
[00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:05.596]  The lady that worked, that we called to set up the interview, that worked for Palfrey's dead.
[00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:07.477]  They killed her.
[00:36:07.497 --> 00:36:11.759]  I mean, they'll be killing all her girls.
[00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:19.003]  They'll be shooting them, throwing them off bridges, and the cowardly yuppies out here will say, oh no, it's quite normal.
[00:36:20.768 --> 00:36:23.111]  Brandi Britton found dead in her Baltimore home.
[00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:26.014]  Alexis is sophisticated, refined, educated, and articulate.
[00:36:26.755 --> 00:36:28.297]  This may be Dick Cheney's girl.
[00:36:28.477 --> 00:36:29.298]  God, man.
[00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:31.821]  She has two bachelors of science.
[00:36:31.961 --> 00:36:35.025]  I just said earlier in the last hour, get ready for him to kill a bunch of people.
[00:36:37.089 --> 00:36:47.352]  Remember Jack Ruby, is that six or seven of the girls who worked in his strip club mysteriously suicided themselves within a year after the Kennedy assassination.
[00:36:47.392 --> 00:36:49.073]  So again, this is nothing new.
[00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:53.874]  This is one more part in the chain of the evil that is going on.
[00:36:53.954 --> 00:36:55.915]  And I really appreciate what you're doing, Alex.
[00:36:55.995 --> 00:36:57.215]  But she'd been convicted!
[00:36:57.235 --> 00:37:00.576]  I guarantee you she was trying to get out of the country, keep her mouth shut.
[00:37:00.596 --> 00:37:01.836]  I guess they just got to tie up loose ends.
[00:37:02.257 --> 00:37:03.477]  I wonder how many girls they're going to kill.
[00:37:05.373 --> 00:37:06.333]  Geez, man, they're so evil.
[00:37:06.653 --> 00:37:07.494]  But to them, it's war.
[00:37:07.514 --> 00:37:08.894]  I mean, they kill a million Iraqis.
[00:37:08.994 --> 00:37:09.955]  Why not kill these girls?
[00:37:11.575 --> 00:37:13.296]  Alexis is sophisticated, refined.
[00:37:13.316 --> 00:37:14.616]  Oh, by the way, you think you're going to get away with this?
[00:37:14.997 --> 00:37:16.017]  You're all losing your pension funds.
[00:37:16.037 --> 00:37:17.117]  They're going to take everything you've got.
[00:37:17.498 --> 00:37:19.038]  By giving in to these guys, you let them win.
[00:37:19.058 --> 00:37:20.219]  They're going to have their way with you now.
[00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:23.260]  I am just blown away right now.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:23.800]  Let me read this.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.301]  Alexis is sophisticated, refined, educated, and articulate.
[00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:31.583]  She has two bachelor's degrees of science, one in biology and the other in sociology.
[00:37:32.303 --> 00:37:33.484]  She holds a Ph.D.
[00:37:33.524 --> 00:37:34.544]  from an elite university.
[00:37:41.428 --> 00:37:44.331]  Oh yeah, she killed herself a few months ago, that's right.
[00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:45.112]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:37:45.492 --> 00:37:47.034]  Same thing though, they're getting rid of the loose ends.
[00:37:47.394 --> 00:37:49.837]  And this is the one that Palfrey was hinting was with Cheney.
[00:37:54.704 --> 00:37:55.545]  We'll see what happens.
[00:37:55.565 --> 00:37:59.468]  You know, I've forgotten about her killing herself in suspicious circumstances.
[00:37:59.789 --> 00:38:02.311]  Well, I know you've had Kathy O'Brien on your show before.
[00:38:02.411 --> 00:38:02.651]  Yes.
[00:38:03.012 --> 00:38:08.757]  And Kathy O'Brien, for fifteen years, has been talking about this in her book, Transformation Over America.
[00:38:08.777 --> 00:38:09.658]  Cheney likes women.
[00:38:09.678 --> 00:38:11.500]  He's one of the few in the guild.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.201]  He won't touch men.
[00:38:15.363 --> 00:38:17.405]  He likes to rape women and break their jaws.
[00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:18.726]  His favorite thing.
[00:38:19.247 --> 00:38:20.087]  Reporting, according to her.
[00:38:21.124 --> 00:38:29.167]  Yeah, and for those of you who have not read the book, Transformation Over America, it is one of the saddest books that you will ever read, but it is one of the most educational.
[00:38:29.187 --> 00:38:35.869]  And by the way, when I snuck in the grove, and I got other pieces later, what she's saying fits with stuff that only you'd have to be in there to know.
[00:38:37.026 --> 00:38:41.989]  And I've been in the Grove also, and you know that little hotel right outside there?
[00:38:42.009 --> 00:38:46.391]  That's where they keep all the prostitutes that they used to bring in there, and then they would snuff them.
[00:38:46.451 --> 00:38:48.072]  In Monterey, the little town right outside?
[00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:51.394]  Yeah, and they would keep them there, and then when they got too old, they'd snuff them.
[00:38:52.134 --> 00:38:54.855]  You know, I mean, this is unfortunately...
[00:38:57.316 --> 00:38:58.576]  It's sad, but it's true.
[00:38:58.717 --> 00:39:05.839]  And the fact is that this is the only radio station that I know that is talking about this stuff as clearly.
[00:39:05.859 --> 00:39:08.660]  Now, there's a few others that are doing it, and I really appreciate it.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.580]  But they're mainly obsessed with one issue or the other.
[00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:19.123]  Well, anybody who has the courage to talk about this stuff has just got tremendous courage, because the truth has to come out.
[00:39:19.163 --> 00:39:20.023]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:39:20.043 --> 00:39:20.924]  These same guys
[00:39:21.804 --> 00:39:22.625]  Well, they're vampires.
[00:39:36.681 --> 00:39:37.281]  I think so, yes.
[00:39:59.534 --> 00:40:00.775]  These people damn that up.
[00:40:00.835 --> 00:40:02.116]  They hold it all to themselves.
[00:40:02.156 --> 00:40:02.457]  Absolutely.
[00:40:02.477 --> 00:40:18.652]  And what they are doing is that they're doing everything they can through the food, through our education system, through the media, to cut us off from the reality that we are divine beings, that we are spiritual beings having a human experience.
[00:40:18.672 --> 00:40:23.256]  And they want us to believe that we're human beings having an occasional spiritual experience.
[00:40:24.517 --> 00:40:47.102]  Through the change of the food, through the fluoride, through the chemtrails, through the insane television set, through this insanity with football, and I love football, but this constant destruction of the consciousness of the people of this world, not just in the United States, but throughout this whole world, they are making the people slaves, and they're doing a heck of a good job at it.
[00:40:47.602 --> 00:40:48.122]  Absolutely!
[00:40:49.442 --> 00:40:50.263]  We're not going to take it.
[00:40:50.283 --> 00:40:52.803]  The tide has changed.
[00:40:53.444 --> 00:40:53.844]  They know it.
[00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:54.564]  They can feel it.
[00:40:54.664 --> 00:40:57.585]  The momentum has changed.
[00:40:57.625 --> 00:41:02.727]  Fifteen years ago, you talk about this stuff, and people would look at you and say, you're crazy.
[00:41:02.807 --> 00:41:05.028]  Ten years ago, they'd get in your face and be so mad.
[00:41:05.348 --> 00:41:09.970]  Now, wherever I go, people are coming and talking to me.
[00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:11.590]  They're sharing information.
[00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:12.811]  They're bringing me stories.
[00:41:13.371 --> 00:41:32.507]  They're sharing this information with their friends and their family, and because we have the objective information, and because we are supporting the universal law, that all human beings are part of this creation, and that this world, and this culture, and this thing called our Constitutional Republic are worth preserving.
[00:41:33.806 --> 00:41:34.226]  They are.
[00:41:34.367 --> 00:41:42.333]  I actually had my news article in here that Paul Watson wrote about this top globalist, head of the Kissinger Group, where he just comes out and he admits everything.
[00:41:43.714 --> 00:41:54.203]  It was here in my stack, but while I'm finding that, one example of how this huge awakening is taking place is Ron Paul's book comes out today and it's number one on Amazon.
[00:41:54.683 --> 00:41:56.885]  By the way, we sell it at InfoWars if you want to support us too.
[00:41:57.305 --> 00:41:59.027]  Have the book there discounted with some other things.
[00:42:02.039 --> 00:42:03.601]  You know, I'm so freaked out by what's happening.
[00:42:03.641 --> 00:42:04.663]  So focused, really.
[00:42:05.103 --> 00:42:06.906]  Not even freaked out with the word, so focused.
[00:42:07.487 --> 00:42:12.073]  Now, I get more and more focused every day that I don't even spend time plugging my books and videos and things we sell.
[00:42:12.614 --> 00:42:17.441]  A, that supports us, but B, more importantly, these are powerful films, whether it's Washington, You're Fired.
[00:42:18.642 --> 00:42:23.206]  That we carry discounted, or this isn't even available yet until the end of the month, but it's available here.
[00:42:23.266 --> 00:42:23.707]  We have it.
[00:42:24.187 --> 00:42:26.149]  American Drug War that I consulted on and that I'm in.
[00:42:26.389 --> 00:42:28.511]  Exposing how they bring the drugs in and how it's all a big scam.
[00:42:30.552 --> 00:42:32.334]  And this is starting to come out.
[00:42:32.374 --> 00:42:35.837]  This is starting to happen.
[00:42:36.237 --> 00:42:38.259]  Here is the story.
[00:42:38.299 --> 00:42:40.261]  Elitist Blueprint for World Government Revealed.
[00:42:40.621 --> 00:42:44.504]  I'm going to put this up on the document cam for everybody.
[00:42:45.518 --> 00:42:50.242]  And you can see the cover of the book here if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV right now.
[00:42:53.004 --> 00:42:58.169]  You can see the cover of the book and it's got the globe with a key connected.
[00:42:59.446 --> 00:43:00.107]  Attached to it.
[00:43:00.427 --> 00:43:02.008]  Hard to talk and run the studio here.
[00:43:02.028 --> 00:43:03.570]  I'm getting better at it, though.
[00:43:04.671 --> 00:43:13.919]  Superclass is the name of the book, and this is the head of Kissinger Associates, one of the head guys of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, which causes war.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:24.389]  And in here, they just come right out and say, we're taking your freedom, we're going to take the web, we're going to take your property, we're going to rule you, we're going to get rid of your countries, due process.
[00:43:25.988 --> 00:43:32.195]  And he goes and gives interviews basically saying, but it's a good idea because we're the 6,000 experts and we know best.
[00:43:32.235 --> 00:43:34.458]  Your comments on David Rothkopf.
[00:43:36.278 --> 00:44:01.265]  This is just one more of dozens and dozens of examples, going back to Adam Weishauf in 1776, going through Marx and Engels, going through Albert Pike, going through Lenin and Stalin, and going through all the socialists and the communists and the collectivists, and now what we call the ultra-capitalists, which are not capitalists at all.
[00:44:01.285 --> 00:44:02.405]  They're monopoly capitalists!
[00:44:02.585 --> 00:44:02.645]  Yes.
[00:44:19.224 --> 00:44:26.389]  I became aware of this not only in my mind and my intellect, but my heart and my whole being, you know, 15 years ago.
[00:44:26.929 --> 00:44:28.811]  And so I am fully aware of this.
[00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:34.355]  And, you know, the fact is, is that these people are living in separation consciousness.
[00:44:34.375 --> 00:44:37.257]  They consider human life to be trivial.
[00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:41.920]  They consider only themselves and their own family to be of value.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:42.800]  And that's a key point.
[00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:51.043]  You know, once you can decide to kill a million Iraqis, bomb them, once Madeleine Albright in an NBC interview can say, yeah, 700,000 dead Iraqi kids.
[00:44:51.723 --> 00:44:52.283]  Was it worth it?
[00:44:52.563 --> 00:44:53.243]  And she said, yep.
[00:44:53.504 --> 00:44:54.664]  You know, it's worth it.
[00:44:54.924 --> 00:44:56.645]  But if it's her kids, she's not going to say that.
[00:44:57.105 --> 00:44:58.845]  And see, they tell us there's no morals.
[00:44:58.885 --> 00:45:00.066]  They tell us nothing matters.
[00:45:00.086 --> 00:45:02.686]  They tell us they don't have to follow the rules, but we do.
[00:45:03.387 --> 00:45:05.707]  This is just an elitist argument they use.
[00:45:05.727 --> 00:45:07.088]  They're absolute scum.
[00:45:07.108 --> 00:45:07.688]  And here's the deal.
[00:45:07.968 --> 00:45:08.948]  I want the viewers to know this.
[00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:10.729]  It's either us or them.
[00:45:11.564 --> 00:45:13.125]  You know, and here's the problem.
[00:45:13.165 --> 00:45:19.309]  A normal person, a good person, loves other people, does some wrong things, gets competitive, but feels guilty about it.
[00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.810]  Has that, you know, that connection to everybody else.
[00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:23.111]  Understands we're all interconnected.
[00:45:23.331 --> 00:45:25.092]  That's why you don't want to do something bad to somebody.
[00:45:25.352 --> 00:45:28.874]  It's because you feel like you're doing it to yourself because in the law of the universe you are.
[00:45:29.995 --> 00:45:31.356]  But these people are cancer.
[00:45:31.436 --> 00:45:32.096]  They grow.
[00:45:32.176 --> 00:45:33.076]  They control.
[00:45:33.116 --> 00:45:33.997]  They metastasize.
[00:45:34.037 --> 00:45:35.037]  They think they're winning.
[00:45:35.157 --> 00:45:36.518]  They're really an anathema.
[00:45:36.558 --> 00:45:37.698]  They're really a malfunction.
[00:45:38.099 --> 00:45:40.880]  They're really like antimatter in the rest of this universe.
[00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.021]  And to them, I mean, it means nothing to kill people.
[00:45:44.081 --> 00:45:45.662]  It means nothing to kill women.
[00:45:45.682 --> 00:45:46.942]  It means nothing to rape children.
[00:45:47.683 --> 00:45:50.064]  To them, raping a child is like eating a hamburger.
[00:45:50.784 --> 00:45:52.505]  It's an inanimate object for them.
[00:45:52.585 --> 00:45:53.145]  It's screaming.
[00:45:53.205 --> 00:45:53.765]  It's pain.
[00:45:54.065 --> 00:45:54.946]  It's about their power.
[00:45:55.726 --> 00:46:09.782]  And they've just convinced you and conned you to not care, and they've shown you and glorified murderers and torturers on TV so you would fantasize along with them, so you would accept their activities to make our atmosphere the way their atmosphere is.
[00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:15.769]  You see, they are seducing us all into evil because they need to have us go along with it to be able to carry it out.
[00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:17.570]  And so this is life and death.
[00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:21.191]  All of you out there watching need to know, this is absolute life and death.
[00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:22.371]  They are coming down.
[00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:23.352]  They are poisoning you.
[00:46:23.392 --> 00:46:25.152]  They are carrying out eugenics against you.
[00:46:25.613 --> 00:46:27.753]  And we're going to just keep talking during this four-minute break.
[00:46:27.793 --> 00:46:35.216]  If you're an InfoWars.com listener, or if you're watching us right now on PrisonPlanet.tv, we'll be back in four minutes on the main radio networks.
[00:46:35.676 --> 00:46:36.677]  Stay with us.
[00:46:37.137 --> 00:46:38.837]  Last ten minutes with George Humphrey.
[00:46:39.098 --> 00:46:42.719]  Again, go to the InfoWars.com streams and you can listen there if you'd like.
[00:46:42.759 --> 00:46:44.640]  If not, we'll be back in four minutes.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.220]  Please stay with us.
[00:46:48.576 --> 00:46:50.288]  We're good to go.
[00:46:54.475 --> 00:47:01.459]  George Humphrey, we're going to come back and talk about whatever subjects you want, but right now in the four minutes we've got, any other subjects, topics, things you want to get out?
[00:47:01.959 --> 00:47:18.448]  Well, I think that the most important thing is, I would guess that probably 75% plus of your listeners, if not a higher percentage, are totally aware of the reality and the danger and the darkness and the evil of the New World Order.
[00:47:19.168 --> 00:47:22.311]  And the question right now is, how do we respond to this?
[00:47:22.352 --> 00:47:26.095]  Do we respond in fear, or do we really want to win this thing?
[00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:32.983]  Do we really, really, really want to win this thing, or are we going to be... I think the answer is to jump.
[00:47:33.163 --> 00:47:35.645]  Just commit, and once you've jumped, there's no turning back.
[00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:36.406]  Absolutely.
[00:47:36.426 --> 00:47:37.887]  I mean, that's a trick in football.
[00:47:37.907 --> 00:47:40.510]  Not that I was a great player, but I was okay for a little guy.
[00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.231]  I only weighed 160 pounds.
[00:47:42.531 --> 00:47:44.993]  Now I weigh 250.
[00:47:45.033 --> 00:47:48.976]  They always taught you, just don't go 110% and you don't get hurt as much.
[00:47:49.017 --> 00:47:53.901]  When you don't care, when you fully commit, you've got a lot more strength and your mind's in control.
[00:47:54.521 --> 00:48:00.146]  You're kind of on that side of your brain that Luke Skywalker's in when he doesn't think, he shoots the photon torpedo into the Death Star.
[00:48:00.826 --> 00:48:02.028]  Go ahead and talk about that.
[00:48:02.148 --> 00:48:09.857]  Yeah, and absolutely is that when you are totally in the moment and committed to what you're doing, you have ten times more power.
[00:48:10.237 --> 00:48:15.404]  And so many of the patriot people I know who say they're patriots, they're just so wishy-washy.
[00:48:15.424 --> 00:48:17.626]  They're front porch patriots.
[00:48:17.666 --> 00:48:19.689]  They can talk about it, but they don't do anything.
[00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:30.835]  And the reality, though, is if we play their game, if we play the game of the established media, if we play the game of the corporate borg, we're going to lose this thing.
[00:48:31.015 --> 00:48:32.035]  They have more guns.
[00:48:32.455 --> 00:48:33.436]  They've got more money.
[00:48:33.476 --> 00:48:35.017]  They've got positions of power.
[00:48:35.377 --> 00:48:36.457]  That's just the reality.
[00:48:36.537 --> 00:48:39.399]  And they cheat, and they're deceptive, and they've got total will.
[00:48:39.519 --> 00:48:42.801]  Yes, and they don't play by the rules.
[00:48:43.241 --> 00:48:48.424]  So the reality is, is that, you know, even though we're greater in number,
[00:48:49.364 --> 00:48:56.888]  Is that they have more of the material weapons, but we have what's something which is ten times more valuable.
[00:48:57.248 --> 00:48:58.869]  We have moral right.
[00:48:58.929 --> 00:49:00.310]  We have universal law.
[00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.052]  We have God's energy on our side.
[00:49:03.412 --> 00:49:12.417]  God did not create this beautiful, beautiful planet for us to destroy this and for people to live in abject terror.
[00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.599]  We as human beings are not animals.
[00:49:16.719 --> 00:49:17.979]  Christina Ebersole says this.
[00:49:17.999 --> 00:49:23.722]  She says that justice bends towards those that stand up.
[00:49:23.742 --> 00:49:25.903]  The law of the universe bends towards justice.
[00:49:25.943 --> 00:49:26.983]  And the enemy knows that.
[00:49:27.183 --> 00:49:29.505]  That's why they always want the positions of power, the high ground.
[00:49:29.725 --> 00:49:30.805]  That's why they're so afraid of us.
[00:49:31.065 --> 00:49:31.666]  But it's true.
[00:49:32.286 --> 00:49:39.049]  The founder of the Texas Rangers said, a man in the wrong can't stand up to a man on the right who keeps on coming.
[00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:55.755]  Absolutely, and the fact is that more and more and more people every hour, every day, every month are waking up to this reality, the reality of this New World Order, which I call the First Awakening.
[00:49:56.215 --> 00:49:57.036]  We're good to go.
[00:50:14.699 --> 00:50:30.672]  Do greater miracles than I will, and they all went out and healed people all over, and every single person listening to this has as much power as myself or Alex, and you just have to believe in yourself.
[00:50:31.012 --> 00:50:42.802]  So if you really are truly committed to a world where we get rid of this separation consciousness, with this terror, and you want to bring back justice,
[00:50:43.382 --> 00:50:47.845]  You have to become first aware of your own connection with God.
[00:50:47.865 --> 00:50:48.205]  Stay there.
[00:50:48.226 --> 00:50:48.766]  Stay there.
[00:50:48.786 --> 00:50:49.426]  We're going live again.
[00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:49.606]  Okay.
[00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:50.867]  Online today.
[00:50:50.887 --> 00:50:58.853]  There's a woman in the street.
[00:50:59.453 --> 00:51:00.734]  She's got a baby in her hand.
[00:51:02.796 --> 00:51:03.797]  She wants another hit.
[00:51:41.187 --> 00:51:42.428]  Final segment with George Humphrey.
[00:51:42.448 --> 00:51:46.811]  Then we're going to get into some really serious issues with global water, the climate, what's happening.
[00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:53.035]  And then we've got Professor Michel Chassidovsky on his view.
[00:51:53.075 --> 00:51:54.496]  Will we be attacking Iran?
[00:51:54.917 --> 00:51:55.937]  What's the globalist's next move?
[00:51:55.977 --> 00:51:57.879]  What does he think of the three major candidates?
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:04.243]  And I'm going to air in the last 30 minutes the Barbara Jean Palfrey clip.
[00:52:05.244 --> 00:52:09.006]  One of the girls that worked for her that reportedly was visiting with somebody at the White House
[00:52:10.637 --> 00:52:12.959]  Uh, you get killed saying it, but hey, so what?
[00:52:12.979 --> 00:52:14.920]  I only live once, so I might as well call it away.
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.380]  I already jumped off the cliff, it doesn't matter.
[00:52:17.221 --> 00:52:23.764]  Uh, and she killed herself suspiciously, now Deborah Jean Palfrey, who said she would never kill herself, is dead.
[00:52:23.784 --> 00:52:29.888]  Uh, we got about four minutes left, uh, and other, other things you think need to be covered, other things we should go over.
[00:52:30.188 --> 00:52:30.608]  George Humphrey.
[00:52:30.728 --> 00:52:43.673]  Well, I think the most important thing is that the people who are listening to this show are committed to the Republic, they're committed to peace, they're committed to justice, they're committed to doing things the right way and to their families.
[00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.934]  And to do so, we have to go from
[00:52:47.535 --> 00:53:11.310]  From a fear consciousness to a consciousness that being totally aware of your own personal power, because no matter how much information you know, if you consider yourself, if you think of yourself a victim, if you keep watching the television, if you keep believing the race between McCain and Hillary and Obama is the real thing, if you keep watching about whether Bernanke is raising or lowering
[00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:19.420]  I follow the economics all day long, but the whole situation out there is an illusion.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.929]  If we really want to restore this country, if we want to clean up this environment, we have to come together in groups.
[00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:28.491]  We have to create community.
[00:53:30.413 --> 00:53:35.777]  You know, more people in this world than there ever has been, there's less and less community.
[00:53:35.817 --> 00:53:37.378]  There's more and more fear.
[00:53:37.778 --> 00:53:49.165]  As the kids are spending so much time going on MySpace and the computer, you know, they're meeting people through the computer instead of just walking down the street and meeting their neighbors.
[00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:54.749]  And we have to realize that God did not, does not, and did not create junk.
[00:53:55.269 --> 00:53:55.930]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.121 --> 00:54:11.941]  Well, I want to be clear.
[00:54:12.221 --> 00:54:16.363]  You need to choose to be in control of your own destiny, which is what God who created the universe.
[00:54:16.423 --> 00:54:20.684]  And even if you don't believe in God, everybody knows you should be in control of your own destiny.
[00:54:21.265 --> 00:54:25.286]  The New Order lies and says it's all science, it's all chemicals, you have no free will.
[00:54:25.326 --> 00:54:25.866]  That's bull.
[00:54:25.906 --> 00:54:26.906]  They know you've got free will.
[00:54:26.926 --> 00:54:30.948]  Yeah, they want to create a materialistic, secular, atheistic... Where they program you.
[00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:32.729]  But that's the key here.
[00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.473]  Even if they kill me, or set me up, or put me in prison, or do that to George... Which they're not going to do.
[00:54:36.613 --> 00:54:37.394]  Which they're not going to do.
[00:54:37.454 --> 00:54:37.914]  Pray for us.
[00:54:38.215 --> 00:54:40.096]  The point is, is that we win.
[00:54:40.357 --> 00:54:48.465]  Because we made the decision to put ourselves in the way of the fist, and we know striking us down will make us more powerful than they can possibly imagine.
[00:54:48.765 --> 00:54:49.446]  And they know that.
[00:54:50.026 --> 00:54:50.367]  Okay.
[00:54:50.727 --> 00:54:51.127]  They know that.
[00:54:51.147 --> 00:54:54.031]  They're afraid it'll come out that Cheney's got, you know, hookers.
[00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.813]  And that's why they're having to kill these women.
[00:54:56.033 --> 00:54:57.735]  The point is, they are scared.
[00:54:57.995 --> 00:54:58.616]  They are weak.
[00:54:58.676 --> 00:54:59.196]  They are bad.
[00:54:59.356 --> 00:55:00.918]  And Cheney's old news now.
[00:55:00.998 --> 00:55:02.680]  I mean... Yeah, they're moving on.
[00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.322]  They're just cleaning up some loose ends.
[00:55:04.342 --> 00:55:05.784]  Yeah, they're just cleaning up loose ends.
[00:55:06.204 --> 00:55:08.927]  And, you know, who's taking Cheney's position, who knows.
[00:55:09.007 --> 00:55:11.210]  But the point is, is that they're out there
[00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.374]  And we can't keep focusing on them.
[00:55:14.454 --> 00:55:17.398]  We have to create our own communities, our own economies.
[00:55:17.698 --> 00:55:19.180]  We have to take care of our health.
[00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:22.565]  We have to do the things to make ourselves healthy.
[00:55:22.625 --> 00:55:23.066]  Exactly.
[00:55:23.146 --> 00:55:24.127]  I don't obsess on them.
[00:55:24.167 --> 00:55:28.873]  I think they're pathetic, they're scum, but I don't fight them because I hate them.
[00:55:29.714 --> 00:55:30.855]  That's 25% of it.
[00:55:31.015 --> 00:55:33.117]  75% of it is my love of everybody else.
[00:55:33.157 --> 00:55:34.839]  Because I love happy people.
[00:55:35.139 --> 00:55:35.979]  I love humanity.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:36.720]  I love beauty.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:37.821]  But see, they're greedy.
[00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:38.421]  They're envious.
[00:55:38.442 --> 00:55:38.982]  They're hateful.
[00:55:39.342 --> 00:55:40.683]  But we're opposite.
[00:55:40.864 --> 00:55:42.145]  We need to work together.
[00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:44.226]  And that doesn't mean going and joining one group.
[00:55:44.266 --> 00:55:46.148]  That means just having a better attitude.
[00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:47.209]  Realizing we're going to win.
[00:55:47.489 --> 00:55:51.132]  Realizing that if they nuke us tomorrow, we still won.
[00:55:51.412 --> 00:55:52.813]  Because they're losers to begin with.
[00:55:52.873 --> 00:55:55.336]  Only a loser would want to go do all these horrible, evil things.
[00:55:56.175 --> 00:56:01.818]  Well, Alex, I really, as always, I always energize by coming around here.
[00:56:02.099 --> 00:56:02.899]  I love you, man!
[00:56:02.919 --> 00:56:03.940]  You are so cool!
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.461]  I get energized around you, George!
[00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:17.208]  You're absolutely the best, and for the people listening, support Alex, buy his tapes, buy his books, listen to him, tell your friends, and we need to create that critical mass.
[00:56:17.248 --> 00:56:18.849]  We're getting closer and closer.
[00:56:19.369 --> 00:56:19.989]  Every one of you.
[00:56:20.129 --> 00:56:20.910]  One of you listening.
[00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:22.571]  Maybe the one that pushes it over the edge.
[00:56:22.591 --> 00:56:27.773]  And if every one of you will just go to one of your friends today and bring the subject up.
[00:56:27.813 --> 00:56:28.613]  Just talk to them.
[00:56:28.633 --> 00:56:29.073]  Commit.
[00:56:29.173 --> 00:56:29.394]  Yes.
[00:56:30.034 --> 00:56:36.457]  Create a larger and larger awareness of what's going on and realize that we're going to win this thing.
[00:56:36.477 --> 00:56:37.617]  We're going to restore the republic.
[00:56:37.637 --> 00:56:38.758]  GeorgetownFreeFearLove.com.
[00:56:38.798 --> 00:56:39.138]  Thank you, sir.
[00:56:39.178 --> 00:56:39.958]  I love you, my brother.
[00:56:39.978 --> 00:56:40.538]  Good seeing you.
[00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:40.739]  See ya.
[00:57:24.255 --> 00:57:24.695]  We're good to go.

[00:58:53.095 --> 00:58:56.497]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:58:56.617 --> 00:59:01.839]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:02.019 --> 00:59:06.761]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed... Hey, bro!
[00:59:06.781 --> 00:59:07.301]  You there, Jon?
[00:59:07.541 --> 00:59:09.242]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter.
[00:59:09.302 --> 00:59:09.622]  Yes, sir.
[00:59:09.782 --> 00:59:10.403]  Got Tim Ball?
[00:59:10.723 --> 00:59:11.523]  Yep, he's all set.
[00:59:11.843 --> 00:59:11.983]  Ah!
[00:59:12.424 --> 00:59:19.867]  And then, um... I'm trying to hunt down the, uh... I want to make a compilation of every time she said she was not going to commit suicide, and then, uh...
[00:59:22.008 --> 00:59:34.134]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:59:34.314 --> 00:59:39.096]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:59:39.476 --> 00:59:50.582]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:59:50.982 --> 00:59:56.527]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:59:56.767 --> 01:00:04.353]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:21.704]  Yeah, sometimes, Satan!
[01:00:58.283 --> 01:01:00.544]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to go to our guest.
[01:01:00.564 --> 01:01:01.525]  I appreciate him joining us.
[01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:06.127]  Atletus Blueprint for World Government Revealed.
[01:01:07.007 --> 01:01:10.549]  Super class, the global power elite and the world they are making.
[01:01:11.858 --> 01:01:26.441]  And it's all admitted that they're taking our liberties, destroying our countries, transferring those powers to a private global government, that they're going to use a police state to control us, that they're going to shut down the free internet exactly as Internet2 says they will, exactly as I've told you as I'm going off their own policy reports.
[01:01:27.597 --> 01:01:36.165]  by David Rothkopf and uh... this fellow, of course, heads up Kissinger Associates, Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
[01:01:36.825 --> 01:01:38.527]  Yeah, sometimes, Satan!
[01:01:38.887 --> 01:01:40.488]  He comes as a man of peace!
[01:01:41.269 --> 01:01:51.758]  The Church Committee got their own documents, how they start wars, fund Hitler, always trying to destroy things, and the head of the Council on Foreign Relations recently republished a Club of Rome report from 1992
[01:01:54.768 --> 01:02:07.452]  1993, put it out last year, where he said, oh, global warming's not man-made and it's not real, but we're going to use it as a unifying effect so that the state directed by us can, quote, wage war against humanity, making humans the enemy.
[01:02:07.572 --> 01:02:09.832]  They mean the predator class against us, the enemies.
[01:02:11.413 --> 01:02:18.195]  And now they want to put up $5.6 billion in, quote, phone booth size scrubbers that suck up deadly CO2.
[01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:21.816]  They've now listed the UN as a toxic chemical.
[01:02:23.393 --> 01:02:28.715]  Totally ridiculous, like listing H2O or salt as a deadly weapon, or oxygen for that matter.
[01:02:29.616 --> 01:02:35.358]  And he says in there, we're not just going to use terrorism as a way to wage war on the population.
[01:02:35.378 --> 01:02:37.079]  This is the head of the CFR, our real government.
[01:02:37.459 --> 01:02:39.420]  He says, we will use global warming!
[01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:43.244]  1993.
[01:02:41.442 --> 01:02:43.244]  And then, of course, going back to the Club of Rome in 1968.
[01:02:43.664 --> 01:02:46.667]  It's all in my film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:02:46.948 --> 01:02:51.653]  You need to get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement on DVD at Infowars.com or online.
[01:02:51.953 --> 01:02:53.776]  Watch it at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:02:54.076 --> 01:02:58.801]  We have the webcams, document cam, guest cam, it's all on right now if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[01:02:59.986 --> 01:03:02.489]  If not, of course, everybody's listening on the AM and FM dial shortwave internet.
[01:03:02.509 --> 01:03:03.189]  We appreciate you.
[01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.652]  So that's what's going on.
[01:03:06.112 --> 01:03:08.555]  And I thought I would get Timothy F. Ball on.
[01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:12.779]  He's a PhD, retired university professor and global warming skeptic.
[01:03:12.819 --> 01:03:20.607]  He heads the Natural Resources Stewardship Project and formerly head of the activist organization Friends of Science, which was funded by energy companies.
[01:03:20.627 --> 01:03:20.907]  That's what
[01:03:22.088 --> 01:03:26.891]  That's what we see here out of the good old folks at Wikipedia.
[01:03:27.291 --> 01:03:34.016]  And the Rockefellers are trying to basically fire Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil because he won't join along.
[01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:36.057]  Hey, I'm not funded by ExxonMobil.
[01:03:36.077 --> 01:03:36.838]  Let me just tell you something.
[01:03:37.358 --> 01:03:39.399]  I know carbon dioxide is what plants breathe.
[01:03:39.679 --> 01:03:43.422]  I know it's been 14 times higher in the last 200,000 years.
[01:03:43.802 --> 01:03:46.064]  I know that it makes more oxygen that we breathe.
[01:03:46.804 --> 01:03:53.330]  And they've got a new environmental group today that's just cut down trees that they're creating CO2, which they do exhale CO2 as well as oxygen.
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:54.811]  They're now saying, kill the trees!
[01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:58.374]  These people, at the low level, are cult members.
[01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:01.797]  At the highest level, it's because they want a global tax that is stated.
[01:04:02.138 --> 01:04:12.507]  We sued and got the SPP documents last year from the BAMF Canada 2006 North American Union meeting, and it said it's a fraud, but that they want to use it as a way to tax us.
[01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:16.052]  And he has an amazing background.
[01:04:16.092 --> 01:04:17.153]  He's called the Water Man.
[01:04:17.193 --> 01:04:20.716]  He's an expert on global water, an expert on what's really happening with CO2.
[01:04:21.216 --> 01:04:26.140]  Thank you for coming on, Professor Timothy F. Ball.
[01:04:27.041 --> 01:04:28.742]  Well, thanks kindly for the opportunity.
[01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.203]  And just a little comment.
[01:04:30.824 --> 01:04:34.387]  Shakespeare said, even the devil can use the scriptures in his arguments.
[01:04:34.967 --> 01:04:35.428]  Exactly.
[01:04:37.767 --> 01:04:41.189]  Well, the Bible says he poses as an angel of light.
[01:04:42.490 --> 01:04:43.371]  You just heard my rant.
[01:04:43.391 --> 01:04:44.292]  I've never talked to you before.
[01:04:44.352 --> 01:04:46.133]  I did hear you on Coast to Coast AM.
[01:04:46.473 --> 01:04:47.154]  What's your take?
[01:04:47.254 --> 01:04:48.735]  I mean, first off, boil it down.
[01:04:49.215 --> 01:04:51.077]  Why are they pushing a global warming scam?
[01:04:51.837 --> 01:04:52.558]  What's the truth?
[01:04:52.658 --> 01:04:53.699]  What's the real science?
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.161]  And then let's get into water.
[01:04:56.361 --> 01:04:58.983]  Is it really scarce like they're trying to fearmonger now?
[01:05:00.447 --> 01:05:06.872]  Okay, in some areas the water is short, but they're usually self-inflicted wounds.
[01:05:07.192 --> 01:05:19.141]  For example, municipalities using water as a loss leader to attract industry and not really taking into account the cost of delivery and dealing with the sewage waste.
[01:05:19.662 --> 01:05:27.707]  So there are some small areas, but overall it's not a problem, not one that the technology isn't available to resolve.
[01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:40.274]  But with regard to the climate change issue, Alex, you mentioned the Limits to Growth Club of Rome and so on, and of course out of that era came a guy by the name of Murray Strong.
[01:05:40.295 --> 01:05:47.599]  And Murray Strong said that the problem for the planet are the industrialized nations and it isn't our responsibility to get rid of them.
[01:05:48.505 --> 01:05:53.388]  And I want the listeners to think about, how would you go about shutting down an industrialized nation?
[01:05:53.408 --> 01:06:00.934]  If you think about the nation like an engine, you can squeeze the fuel line, it'll stop the engine.
[01:06:01.274 --> 01:06:04.576]  But if you did that, there'd be immediate reaction.
[01:06:04.656 --> 01:06:07.698]  And all you gotta do is look at the gas prices going up and the reaction to that.
[01:06:08.358 --> 01:06:13.602]  But you can achieve the same thing by plugging the exhaust.
[01:06:14.022 --> 01:06:16.344]  If you plug up the exhaust of a car, it'll stop.
[01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:22.695]  And if you can show that the exhaust of the industrialized nations is killing the planet...
[01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:26.549]  Then you effectively can shut that down.
[01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:32.774]  And you can tax it, you can regulate it, you can say how big your house is, and they state it's a fraud.
[01:06:33.054 --> 01:06:34.936]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:06:35.356 --> 01:06:38.298]  Please continue, but I wanted to use one example here.
[01:06:38.658 --> 01:06:52.629]  If you give people the scientific name of water, dihydrogen monoxide, 99% of people on the street, and I've done this, and I've seen it done on television, you walk up and say, did you hear about the dihydrogen monoxide problem?
[01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:54.990]  Or did you hear about the spill?
[01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:56.331]  Or just say, should we ban it?
[01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:57.572]  They'll say, absolutely!
[01:06:57.832 --> 01:07:04.117]  It's water, folks, and that's as asinine as saying that carbon dioxide is a toxic waste.
[01:07:04.317 --> 01:07:10.301]  Am I correct in saying it is the main life gas because oxygen came later on this planet, correct?
[01:07:11.162 --> 01:07:12.203]  Well, that's right.
[01:07:12.863 --> 01:07:18.247]  Without the plants, you have no oxygen, and the plants need the CO2 to survive.
[01:07:18.969 --> 01:07:27.895]  And of course, at 385 parts per million, which is the current level, that's the lowest level in the 6 billion year history of the Earth.
[01:07:28.075 --> 01:07:28.535]  Exactly!
[01:07:28.575 --> 01:07:33.219]  The Earth is starved for carbon dioxide, and there are studies on desertification.
[01:07:33.719 --> 01:07:34.459]  We need more!
[01:07:34.639 --> 01:07:36.040]  We should have factories making it!
[01:07:36.981 --> 01:07:40.203]  Well, in fact, it is being used commercially.
[01:07:41.284 --> 01:07:47.388]  In greenhouses, they're pumping in up to 1,000 and 1,200 parts per million, and achieving four times the yield.
[01:07:48.057 --> 01:07:52.211]  And what this indicates is that plants which evolved over the last 300 million years
[01:07:53.168 --> 01:08:00.452]  When the average atmospheric level was between 1,000 and 1,200 parts per million, that that's the level that they function best at.
[01:08:00.512 --> 01:08:03.914]  So at 385, they're essentially malnourished.
[01:08:04.234 --> 01:08:07.916]  And of course, Al Gore and the gang want to reduce that level even more.
[01:08:08.437 --> 01:08:11.178]  And at 250 parts per million, the plants start to die.
[01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:14.560]  You've got no plants, you've got no oxygen, you've got no life on the planet.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:15.281]  I want to stop you.
[01:08:15.361 --> 01:08:19.203]  Now, they can claim that we're all paid by the cabler elves to say this.
[01:08:19.283 --> 01:08:20.844]  Folks, you don't need to believe us.
[01:08:21.804 --> 01:08:28.646]  Oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and sunlight are the four ingredients that you have to have for life.
[01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:33.527]  It has been, now I'm going for the mainline science, you're the expert professor, but I've read all the studies.
[01:08:33.807 --> 01:08:36.007]  Fourteen times higher carbon dioxide.
[01:08:36.268 --> 01:08:40.248]  Plants live longer, grow faster, healthier, then they put out more oxygen.
[01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:44.890]  They've done studies showing that animals, mammals, insects, we want more oxygen.
[01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:46.470]  I want more oxygen!
[01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:52.552]  I don't want these control freaks taxing my air and claiming that life-giving gas is devil poison!
[01:08:54.052 --> 01:08:55.893]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:08:56.013 --> 01:09:03.015]  And of course, you know, you go to the football game and what are those players sitting on the sidelines getting extra oxygen so they can perform better?
[01:09:03.756 --> 01:09:10.778]  By the way, one of the things that the greenhouse and also research, people like Sherwood Itso, all the different plants they've studied,
[01:09:11.498 --> 01:09:14.519]  They also use less water when the CO2 levels are higher.
[01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:27.825]  Have you seen the studies about how, and now they're proving this with the core samples and things they've done, with the robots, the rovers, that Mars lost its atmosphere with the same thing that's happening here?
[01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:30.186]  I guess these bastards want us to lose our atmosphere!
[01:09:31.246 --> 01:09:42.034]  Well, it certainly appears that way, and I guess, you know, one of the things that underlies so much of this is that there's a very deep anti-humanism in the whole environmental movement.
[01:09:42.655 --> 01:09:46.538]  You know, if we could just get the people off the planet, it would be a great place to live.
[01:09:47.278 --> 01:09:51.181]  And you see this, little things trickle out every once in a while.
[01:09:51.221 --> 01:09:53.463]  For example, the Greenpeace report on global warming.
[01:09:53.843 --> 01:09:57.927]  They said the CO2 is added to the atmosphere naturally and unnaturally.
[01:09:57.947 --> 01:10:00.468]  And you say, well, what do you mean by unnatural?
[01:10:00.508 --> 01:10:01.009]  Well, of course,
[01:10:01.403 --> 01:10:02.443]  What they mean is humans.
[01:10:02.944 --> 01:10:06.705]  They say, well, if what we're doing is unnatural, then that makes us unnatural.
[01:10:07.466 --> 01:10:11.907]  And so you see this very deep-seated anti-humanism in all of this.
[01:10:11.967 --> 01:10:12.668]  Are you kidding, sir?
[01:10:12.688 --> 01:10:21.992]  I've been to the meetings where every professor there walks around saying everyone needs to die, and I have their graduate papers from their students saying all humans must be killed.
[01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:27.254]  I mean, this is a vicious cult, and they all work and have access to bioweapons labs.
[01:10:28.342 --> 01:10:38.330]  Well, and of course, that's at the very basic level, but at the intervening level, of course, the idea is to take control of the economy and take control of everything.
[01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:45.917]  I mean, if you look at what Al Gore is doing, where he's going out and telling you CO2 is a pollutant, it's a problem, we've got to get rid of it, we've got to reduce it.
[01:10:46.357 --> 01:10:51.321]  Oh, and by the way, one of the ways we can do it is carbon credits, which is absolute rubbish, doesn't reduce them at all.
[01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:54.624]  He then turns around and sets up a company and makes money off of it.
[01:10:55.427 --> 01:11:00.488]  No, I don't know how you look at that, but it appears that that might sound like fraud.
[01:11:00.948 --> 01:11:02.529]  Well, exactly.
[01:11:02.629 --> 01:11:05.369]  I'm waiting for him to say dihydrogen monoxide.
[01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:10.771]  Yeah, there's two things about that, by the way, and it is a wonderful exercise.
[01:11:11.491 --> 01:11:14.011]  It plays on two things that these people exploit.
[01:11:14.151 --> 01:11:15.732]  One is people's fear.
[01:11:17.119 --> 01:11:20.680]  We have natural fears of certain things, and they're exploiting that.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:30.604]  Oh, the sky is going to fall, the world's going to come to an end, and then the emotional words that get in there, oh, the children are going to die, there's going to be no future, the planet, the grandchildren, and so on.
[01:11:31.304 --> 01:11:35.906]  And Michael Crichton wrote about that superbly, how they do that in his book, State of Fear.
[01:11:36.286 --> 01:11:39.527]  But the other thing that they're exploiting is lack of knowledge.
[01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:45.149]  So you can throw out that scientific definition of water, but because people don't know it,
[01:11:45.911 --> 01:11:53.514]  Then they automatically assume, well, because of the way you're doing it, the way you're phrasing the question, this must be something deadly.
[01:11:53.534 --> 01:11:57.495]  And it's that, the lack of knowledge that these people are exploiting.
[01:11:58.455 --> 01:11:59.876]  Hold on, Doc, Doc, Doc.
[01:12:00.096 --> 01:12:04.997]  Hold on for a minute, because since you mentioned that, it's actually known as the dihydrogen monoxide hoax.
[01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:06.938]  Again, that's water, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:07.258 --> 01:12:12.840]  The dihydrogen monoxide hoax involves listing negative effects of water under unfamiliar scientific names.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:21.887]  Then asking individuals to help control the seemingly dangerous substance caused by most people known to the world as monoxide as part of the name of the poisonous gas.
[01:12:22.268 --> 01:12:29.374]  The hoax is designed to illustrate how the lack of scientific knowledge and the exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears that hydrogen monoxide
[01:12:29.814 --> 01:12:34.659]  Shortened to DHMO is a scientific name for water that, while technically correct, is almost never employed.
[01:12:34.699 --> 01:12:38.202]  Now, this is a Wikipedia propaganda piece that I just noticed.
[01:12:38.502 --> 01:12:39.823]  This wasn't here yesterday.
[01:12:39.843 --> 01:12:45.869]  I just clicked on this from Wikipedia and suddenly they changed it, I guess to counter me, as I did a show about it yesterday.
[01:12:46.289 --> 01:12:47.070]  But no, it's not...
[01:12:49.712 --> 01:12:54.075]  Twisting it, you can go out and say, should we ban dihydrogen monoxide?
[01:12:54.275 --> 01:12:58.217]  And most people will say yes, okay, without even listing bad effects.
[01:12:58.657 --> 01:13:01.539]  So see, they're very upset that we're showing their fraud now.
[01:13:01.579 --> 01:13:01.899]  Go ahead.
[01:13:03.606 --> 01:13:07.029]  And of course, as I said, it is that exploitation of lack of knowledge.
[01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:10.131]  But just to look at the CO2 thing for a second.
[01:13:10.172 --> 01:13:13.974]  First of all, the idea is out there that it's the most important greenhouse gas.
[01:13:14.034 --> 01:13:14.375]  It isn't.
[01:13:14.415 --> 01:13:16.957]  Water vapor is by far the most important greenhouse gas.
[01:13:17.938 --> 01:13:18.778]  CO2 is less than 4%.
[01:13:18.838 --> 01:13:22.421]  But the basic assumption they make in their theory
[01:13:25.583 --> 01:13:34.830]  Is that, oh, if CO2 traps heat, so if CO2 in the atmosphere increases, and it will because humans are producing more, then the temperature will increase.
[01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:37.051]  That's fundamental to their theory.
[01:13:37.572 --> 01:13:41.074]  The problem is, the evidence shows exactly the opposite.
[01:13:41.655 --> 01:13:46.838]  That the ice core record of 420,000 years shows that temperature changes before CO2.
[01:13:47.259 --> 01:13:49.520]  CO2 does not drive temperature.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:50.961]  It follows what, 700 years after non-average?
[01:13:52.765 --> 01:14:07.677]  There's about an 800 year lag, but that can be as low as an 80 year lag, and one of the reasons they stopped talking about global warming and started talking about climate change is because they've got this problem that since 2000 the global temperature's been declining.
[01:14:07.697 --> 01:14:10.139]  That's because the sun has now started cooling.
[01:14:10.159 --> 01:14:18.085]  Yeah, exactly, but the CO2 continues to go up, so they've got this great problem of evidence that completely contradicts what they're arguing.
[01:14:19.065 --> 01:14:20.847]  So they simply shift the goalposts.
[01:14:21.716 --> 01:14:22.136]  Absolutely.
[01:14:22.176 --> 01:14:24.278]  Please continue.
[01:14:24.318 --> 01:14:31.343]  Well, what I'm saying is that they've shifted the goalposts from global warming and now it's climate change.
[01:14:31.643 --> 01:14:38.288]  Well, you know, you've only got to look at any brief period and you know that the climate changes dramatically all the time.
[01:14:39.049 --> 01:14:41.450]  Well, why then are the public caught up in that?
[01:14:42.651 --> 01:14:45.033]  The fundamental Western view of the world
[01:14:45.695 --> 01:14:47.877]  It's what is called the uniformitarian view.
[01:14:48.338 --> 01:14:51.681]  That is, that change is very gradual over long periods of time.
[01:14:52.461 --> 01:15:02.631]  It goes back to Darwin and to Charles Lyell, the geologist, and so on, and Darwin needed a much older world for his evolutionary theory to occur.
[01:15:02.991 --> 01:15:05.954]  So he says, okay, well, the change is gradual over long periods of time.
[01:15:06.644 --> 01:15:07.765]  That's built in now.
[01:15:08.205 --> 01:15:18.234]  So if you assume in your education that change is gradual, and then suddenly somebody says, oh here's a sudden change, oh that's not natural, that must be something those humans are doing.
[01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.336]  And this is the game that's being played.
[01:15:20.576 --> 01:15:22.838]  And again, I'm not going to get into a debate about Darwin.
[01:15:22.858 --> 01:15:32.947]  The point is, this is a guy 170 years ago coming up with this stuff, 150 years ago, and now everything he quotes said the world works this way,
[01:15:33.527 --> 01:15:35.949]  And they then build all reality around that.
[01:15:35.969 --> 01:15:42.254]  It's like saying the Earth is still the center of the universe, because we now know that, actually, evolutionary changes are fast.
[01:15:42.294 --> 01:15:42.935]  They're sudden.
[01:15:43.836 --> 01:15:44.036]  Yep.
[01:15:44.556 --> 01:15:44.956]  Exactly.
[01:15:45.016 --> 01:15:57.647]  And one of the examples of that is, and I've looked at all the textbooks in North America and in Europe, most of them are still telling the students that the Earth's orbit around the Sun is a fixed, elliptical orbit.
[01:15:58.388 --> 01:15:59.889]  In fact, it isn't fixed at all.
[01:15:59.969 --> 01:16:02.011]  The orbit changes every single year.
[01:16:02.031 --> 01:16:08.936]  And it goes from almost circular, as it is now, to extreme ellipse, as it was just 22,000 years ago.
[01:16:09.596 --> 01:16:13.099]  And the change is caused by the gravitational pull of the planet Jupiter.
[01:16:13.981 --> 01:16:16.883]  And so people say, well, that's new information.
[01:16:16.923 --> 01:16:17.363]  No, it isn't.
[01:16:17.423 --> 01:16:24.868]  We've known that information for 150 years, yet we're still telling our students that the orbit of the Earth is fixed and unchanging.
[01:16:25.809 --> 01:16:30.172]  And we've got this throughout our system, that our view of the world is wrong.
[01:16:30.892 --> 01:16:33.233]  And yet it's built right into our science.
[01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:35.755]  Professor, something I just noticed here.
[01:16:37.366 --> 01:16:45.550]  They admit that water is life-giving and oxygen is life-giving, but they play it down on Wikipedia about carbon dioxide and describe it as some type of devil weapon.
[01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:48.211]  I bet soon they're going to say water's evil.
[01:16:48.251 --> 01:16:49.052]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:16:49.112 --> 01:16:52.193]  I think the public will buy that water is a toxic devil weapon.
[01:16:53.414 --> 01:17:03.719]  Well, they'll pick on anything to achieve their goals, and of course Wikipedia and the way that that is manipulated with people like William Connolly and these other people that go in there
[01:17:04.190 --> 01:17:09.652]  And put in their view of the science, and the minute you try to correct it, it's immediately corrected back.
[01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:16.095]  But you know, you know, you know, you know that this is now the number one reference source, and it's absolute crap.
[01:17:16.415 --> 01:17:16.755]  Go ahead.
[01:17:16.995 --> 01:17:22.718]  Yeah, exactly, but of course what they did was they made sure that if you put in something like, say, ocean currents,
[01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:26.895]  The first source that comes up on Google is the Wikipedia source.
[01:17:26.935 --> 01:17:27.936]  They've arranged that.
[01:17:28.696 --> 01:17:31.937]  And when I talked to high school students, I said, how many of you use Wikipedia?
[01:17:31.957 --> 01:17:32.938]  Well, all of the hands go up.
[01:17:32.998 --> 01:17:37.760]  And I said, how many of you are aware that it can be changed by anybody?
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:46.763]  That you can go in and edit it, but there are groups of people who monitor it and make sure that only their information, what they want out there... Stay there.
[01:17:46.823 --> 01:17:47.203]  Stay there.
[01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:50.344]  Timothy F. Ball, give us some of his websites, books, materials.
[01:17:50.724 --> 01:17:51.265]  Amazing.
[01:17:51.285 --> 01:17:51.805]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:53.075 --> 01:17:54.476]  It is a big idea.
[01:17:54.496 --> 01:17:56.597]  A New World Order.
[01:17:57.297 --> 01:18:01.559]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:18:02.199 --> 01:18:05.020]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.161]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:18:07.822 --> 01:18:10.263]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:18:11.003 --> 01:18:18.326]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:26.323]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:18:26.784 --> 01:18:30.246]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:33.168]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:18:33.228 --> 01:18:34.389]  Most people have no idea.
[01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:35.149]  They're not after money.
[01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:36.250]  They have all the money they need.
[01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:37.051]  They're after power.
[01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:38.131]  That's what they're after these days.

[01:18:50.119 --> 01:18:51.140]  You have been warned.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:56.042]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[01:18:56.482 --> 01:19:01.083]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:06.745]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[01:19:06.965 --> 01:19:17.488]  Though the people of the U.S., where their numbers and influence are strongest, have primary responsibility for reigning them in and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[01:19:17.508 --> 01:19:17.728]  Sup?
[01:19:17.969 --> 01:19:19.149]  They are called Illuminati.
[01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:21.970]  Elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:24.832]  They oppose everything that is God and Truth.
[01:19:25.132 --> 01:19:28.374]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[01:19:28.694 --> 01:19:41.221]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the Earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[01:19:49.727 --> 01:19:50.988]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:19:51.849 --> 01:19:54.791]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:19:54.931 --> 01:20:00.195]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:20:00.455 --> 01:20:05.798]  Even a fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:06.179 --> 01:20:07.299]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.362]  Man, do I have to have every kook religious group advertise stuff on my show?
[01:20:11.422 --> 01:20:13.083]  Can't we just have regular... Hey, Jones.
[01:20:18.991 --> 01:20:21.673]  I mean, it might be nice, I just, it sounds completely freaky.
[01:20:21.993 --> 01:20:23.274]  The message of his kingdom.
[01:20:24.115 --> 01:20:27.037]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:32.441]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:20:32.721 --> 01:20:38.065]  Even a fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:38.465 --> 01:20:39.566]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.926 --> 01:20:48.793]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[01:20:49.233 --> 01:20:50.814]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:20:51.054 --> 01:20:55.236]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:20:55.276 --> 01:20:56.697]  They're safe and you save $85.
[01:20:56.737 --> 01:21:08.223]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.901]  The head of GM comes out and says global warming is a complete scam.
[01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:21.263]  Rex Tillerson won't go along with it at Exxon Mobil.
[01:21:21.303 --> 01:21:24.466]  And the Rockefellers come out of their hole and say, we own the company.
[01:21:25.387 --> 01:21:26.027]  You're gone.
[01:21:27.568 --> 01:21:28.970]  Because they need that global tax.
[01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:30.311]  Believe me, it has nothing to do with the Earth.
[01:21:32.352 --> 01:21:36.115]  And all the science shows, the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever is what plants breathe.
[01:21:36.135 --> 01:21:38.958]  Then they make oxygen as the byproduct for us.
[01:21:39.919 --> 01:21:42.241]  This symbiosis is what lets us live.
[01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:49.391]  We're healthier when there's more oxygen, but I think they're going to start swatting when you're found to have oxygen at your house.
[01:21:49.431 --> 01:21:50.392]  And I'm not even joking.
[01:21:50.452 --> 01:21:53.034]  It'll be like, we're looking for oxygen.
[01:21:53.094 --> 01:21:54.315]  He had one kilo of it.
[01:21:54.355 --> 01:21:55.076]  It was a devil.
[01:21:57.378 --> 01:22:00.641]  I guess Professor Dr. Timothy F. Ball, Ph.D.,
[01:22:02.973 --> 01:22:22.274]  I guess it's that the public has been so dumbed down by public education, but a lot of people aren't buying this now, so as you said, now it's just climate change, and they're going to order our lives and tell us how to live and what to do, because they're the guardians of the earth, and by darn it, humans are evil and we have to exterminate the majority of you, and this is for your own good.
[01:22:23.547 --> 01:22:33.354]  Well, and of course one of the things people forget is that part of the limits to growth and the Club of Rome was the whole thing about overpopulation, and they made that a big issue.
[01:22:33.995 --> 01:22:42.762]  And of course it was Al Gore that organized the conference on population in Cairo, Egypt a few years ago.
[01:22:43.462 --> 01:22:47.145]  And of course the question you've got to ask is, well, who are you going to eliminate?
[01:22:47.185 --> 01:22:48.466]  Which groups are you going to get rid of?
[01:22:50.234 --> 01:22:52.535]  The fact is, the world isn't overpopulated at all.
[01:22:52.595 --> 01:22:58.257]  You can put the world population into surprisingly small areas in very comfortable conditions.
[01:22:58.337 --> 01:23:00.938]  You can also build upwards.
[01:23:01.598 --> 01:23:09.742]  And besides, the world population is going to plane off at 8.5 billion, the UN admits, and then it's going to start dying, because once you industrialize, you have an average of about 1.6 children.
[01:23:11.641 --> 01:23:15.144]  Well, exactly, and countries that are already experiencing that.
[01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:19.807]  Italy is offering a financial reward for any couple that has a third child.
[01:23:19.867 --> 01:23:22.949]  Russia, Germany, Japan.
[01:23:23.009 --> 01:23:30.295]  And China, where they try to deal with the population problem, they've created the situation now where there's an absolute shortage of women.
[01:23:31.019 --> 01:23:39.630]  Well, sir, they're trying to corner the market on water, grab it, double the price, tell you it's because it scares freshwater.
[01:23:40.171 --> 01:23:42.133]  They're trying to do all of this right now.
[01:23:42.514 --> 01:23:43.515]  How do we stop them?
[01:23:43.535 --> 01:23:46.378]  Because they're having governors announce it, corporations announce it.
[01:23:46.418 --> 01:23:47.680]  I mean, it's a full court press.
[01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:49.142]  This is the new tyranny.
[01:23:49.182 --> 01:23:49.823]  How do we stop it?
[01:23:50.834 --> 01:23:52.655]  Well, I think that there's several things going on.
[01:23:52.715 --> 01:23:56.937]  First, to understand that change follows a sawtooth pattern.
[01:23:57.297 --> 01:24:06.140]  That is, that somebody starts raising questions about what's going on, and then very gradually, more and more people get onto it, and programs like yours that bring it to attention.
[01:24:06.701 --> 01:24:09.682]  And then, all of a sudden, overnight, the change will occur.
[01:24:09.702 --> 01:24:13.504]  I mean, if you look at smoking and so on.
[01:24:13.824 --> 01:24:18.946]  For a long time, people then suddenly bang, and now it's completely unacceptable almost to smoke.
[01:24:19.648 --> 01:24:23.390]  And so that's what you have to realize.
[01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:25.691]  These things take time, and the work's getting out there.
[01:24:26.091 --> 01:24:35.676]  The second thing is, of course, that Mother Nature's doing a great job by cooling the Earth down and making all of their predictions look absolutely foolish.
[01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:41.819]  Why is it that every time they have a big global warming summit, they have record cold weather and it's blizzarded out?
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.881]  Well, it's wonderful.
[01:24:44.921 --> 01:24:45.981]  Yeah, I like that.
[01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:52.014]  So you've got the fact that the earth is cooling.
[01:24:52.434 --> 01:25:01.563]  The other thing that's happening is that already some of their policies that have been implemented, and only the more extreme ones... Are wreaking havoc!
[01:25:02.461 --> 01:25:05.063]  Well, yeah, the ethanol thing, for example.
[01:25:05.583 --> 01:25:10.026]  And by the way, that's being aggravated by cool weather.
[01:25:10.727 --> 01:25:12.668]  The Southern Hemisphere has been cooling for 20 years.
[01:25:12.688 --> 01:25:13.509]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:13.549 --> 01:25:17.191]  In fact, we've had bad crops the last four years because of record cooling.
[01:25:17.792 --> 01:25:22.675]  Stay there, stay there, doctor, professor, top expert on climate, water, ice.
[01:25:23.215 --> 01:25:25.217]  I mean, his bio is 85 million miles long.
[01:25:25.997 --> 01:25:29.840]  But we'll be right back with him on the other side of this 72nd break.
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.241]  Transmission continues.
[01:25:34.471 --> 01:25:36.533]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:25:42.677 --> 01:25:44.378]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:25:44.658 --> 01:25:48.081]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:25:48.261 --> 01:25:50.102]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:25:50.723 --> 01:25:53.465]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:25:53.765 --> 01:25:59.149]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:03.431]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:26:03.731 --> 01:26:08.653]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.TV is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:26:08.933 --> 01:26:11.694]  PrisonPlanet.TV is a vault of forbidden information.
[01:26:11.974 --> 01:26:18.817]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[01:26:19.197 --> 01:26:25.019]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:29.221]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much
[01:26:29.241 --> 01:26:30.662]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:06.241 --> 01:27:19.190]  Professor Michelle Chosodosky, geopolitical expert, will be joining us in 30 minutes to give us his rundown on whether he thinks they're going to be attacking Iran, who owns and controls the three puppets.
[01:27:20.959 --> 01:27:27.523]  Big government, fascist, communist, communist, big government, commie, fascist, and commie, commie, double, triple, super commie, fascist.
[01:27:28.284 --> 01:27:39.611]  It doesn't matter either way, they're all owned by the same boys, they're going to give you the global tax, and a whole new core of tattletales running your life, inspecting your home, not letting you have family farms, taxes on beef,
[01:27:40.831 --> 01:27:42.753]  They admit neo-feudalism.
[01:27:42.793 --> 01:27:44.774]  The globalists want to end the middle class.
[01:27:45.294 --> 01:27:48.356]  Al Gore wants $300 million on $10 million.
[01:27:48.756 --> 01:27:51.097]  Brown shirts are kind of like Mal's Little Red Book.
[01:27:51.537 --> 01:27:52.278]  Youth Brigades.
[01:27:52.298 --> 01:27:53.198]  I mean, they say this.
[01:27:54.139 --> 01:27:56.901]  They're already in Austin popping tires of SUVs.
[01:27:56.941 --> 01:28:00.763]  I pulled up to Zilker Park with my kids last week, took them on the train when I took off Thursday.
[01:28:01.503 --> 01:28:06.888]  And I noticed that there were a couple of SUVs that had their tires popped, so I was driving a smaller SUV.
[01:28:06.928 --> 01:28:13.113]  It might have been seen as holy because it was Japanese, but I went and parked it down a little bit so they wouldn't pop my tires.
[01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:16.717]  I saw the ne'er-do-wells walking around engaging in their religious ceremony.
[01:28:17.237 --> 01:28:21.101]  They'd burn down things, burn down ski resorts, you name it, but they don't care.
[01:28:21.701 --> 01:28:26.346]  And by the way, I've written about articles in Canada Free Press that your listeners can look at, but the whole environmental movement
[01:28:46.264 --> 01:28:47.706]  Uh, we needed, we needed that.
[01:28:47.726 --> 01:28:51.051]  It was, we needed change, we needed to look at things differently.
[01:28:51.412 --> 01:29:00.965]  But what happens with these things, Alex, is that, um, the special interest groups and extremists grab these things, and they kill them for their own pers, yeah, for their own personal ends.
[01:29:02.931 --> 01:29:11.797]  When you ask me about how we can slow this down, the role of the extremists, which I've struggled with all of my career, is to say, what's the purpose of that?
[01:29:11.817 --> 01:29:14.980]  It's sort of like, if we got rid of the mosquitoes, would the world come to an end?
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.004]  And what I've realized is the role of the extremists is to define the limits for the rest of us.
[01:29:21.644 --> 01:29:24.206]  If you think about feminism, for example, yeah, it was needed.
[01:29:24.286 --> 01:29:25.607]  There's still some changes needed.
[01:29:26.007 --> 01:29:28.529]  But the majority of women were saying, well, how far do we go with this?
[01:29:29.238 --> 01:29:33.800]  And then some women did silly things, and the majority said, no, no, that's going too far.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:35.161]  Now we're losing more than we're gaining.
[01:29:35.501 --> 01:29:38.462]  But that's precisely what's happened with this environmental thing.
[01:29:39.022 --> 01:29:51.727]  That, yeah, we need to care about the planet, we need to understand, and we need to live in harmony with nature and everything else, but now these people are just taking it beyond, and they're using it for their own personal and political gains.
[01:29:52.508 --> 01:29:57.770]  And, of course, that will also feed back on them, as we were talking before the break about
[01:29:58.484 --> 01:30:03.054]  Uh, about the, uh, rising food prices and the damage that's being done.
[01:30:03.435 --> 01:30:05.460]  And by the way, there's another aspect to this.
[01:30:06.347 --> 01:30:15.995]  Paul Dreesen's written a book called Eco-Imperialism, and this is the imposition of these ecological values of these extremists on the developing country.
[01:30:16.015 --> 01:30:22.321]  Yeah, I mean, Doc, this is their excuse to run our lives and have corporate communism, where they corporatize our wealth.
[01:30:22.341 --> 01:30:34.371]  I had Nobel Prize winner Joseph Tickles on last week, and he said, yeah, the neo-fascists corporatize everything at the top, and they give us socialism, but only as a conduit to suck our goods and our resources and our labor out of us.
[01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:37.593]  And they use these front groups.
[01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:39.494]  I mean, look, that's all that's happening in Anwar.
[01:30:40.155 --> 01:30:42.396]  Atlantic Richfield executives, I've had them on.
[01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.358]  They founded more oil than Saudi Arabia.
[01:30:44.638 --> 01:30:46.759]  We're not allowed to have it because there's too much oil.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.701]  It's meant to create artificial scarcity.
[01:30:48.741 --> 01:30:51.302]  The cartel's doing it with the oil companies.
[01:30:51.563 --> 01:30:53.044]  They're not letting us have the oil.
[01:30:53.284 --> 01:30:57.326]  I mean, does anybody think anybody cares about a few million hippies in sandals?
[01:30:57.607 --> 01:30:59.408]  They're not stopping us having that oil.
[01:30:59.628 --> 01:31:03.591]  The oil companies have got too much oil, and they've created artificial scarcity.
[01:31:04.554 --> 01:31:07.257]  See, they want you to believe it's the idiot environmentalist.
[01:31:07.617 --> 01:31:07.958]  Go ahead.
[01:31:07.998 --> 01:31:08.658]  Well, exactly.
[01:31:09.239 --> 01:31:10.680]  That's the interesting thing about it.
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:17.067]  The paradox that it's to the benefit of the oil companies and the extreme environmentalists to have a shortage.
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:21.683]  It suits both their ends, for different reasons, and I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:31:22.804 --> 01:31:27.627]  Just to give you another example of how they exploit... Well, listen, Doc, I've been interrupting you a lot.
[01:31:27.647 --> 01:31:28.848]  It's just so interesting.
[01:31:28.868 --> 01:31:35.733]  I'm going to try to stick a rubber ball in my mouth after this quick break, and then you've got the floor for the 20 minutes we've got left.
[01:31:36.013 --> 01:31:37.314]  You can just talk about whatever you want.
[01:31:37.655 --> 01:31:39.076]  But I want to shatter paradigms.
[01:31:39.496 --> 01:31:45.420]  Because I know ExxonMobil and others have been forced for decades to actually fund the environmental... They call them wackos.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.241]  They're not wackos.
[01:31:46.621 --> 01:31:51.603]  They're getting power, they're getting money, now they're getting guns, and they're coming for us.
[01:31:53.104 --> 01:31:54.505]  It is a big idea.
[01:31:54.525 --> 01:31:56.646]  A new world order.
[01:31:57.346 --> 01:32:01.608]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:32:01.648 --> 01:32:05.050]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:07.331]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:32:07.851 --> 01:32:10.252]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:32:11.028 --> 01:32:18.354]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:32:21.374 --> 01:32:26.337]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:32:26.838 --> 01:32:30.280]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.202]  Build America is making great progress for the world government.
[01:32:33.262 --> 01:32:34.403]  Most people have no idea.
[01:32:34.423 --> 01:32:35.183]  They're not after money.
[01:32:35.203 --> 01:32:36.284]  They have all the money they need.
[01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:37.185]  They're after power.
[01:32:37.465 --> 01:32:38.305]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:32:47.371 --> 01:32:49.633]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:32:50.133 --> 01:32:51.174]  You have been warned.
[01:32:52.095 --> 01:32:53.456]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[01:32:53.676 --> 01:32:57.220]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.286]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[01:33:03.406 --> 01:33:07.170]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[01:33:07.491 --> 01:33:11.975]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[01:33:12.235 --> 01:33:14.618]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems
[01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.699]  Church and state must be kept separate.
[01:33:16.899 --> 01:33:20.642]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[01:33:20.942 --> 01:33:23.344]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[01:33:23.544 --> 01:33:28.667]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[01:33:28.848 --> 01:33:32.230]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[01:33:32.530 --> 01:33:35.152]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[01:33:35.312 --> 01:33:37.854]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[01:33:38.074 --> 01:33:39.775]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[01:33:39.995 --> 01:33:41.338]  Jesus is coming soon!

[01:33:51.622 --> 01:33:59.268]  Oral Products now is introducing the new Detox Your Foot and Body Pads that work while you're sleeping to pull heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[01:33:59.548 --> 01:34:07.474]  Our Detox Your Pads release unwanted toxins, relieve stress and pain, and improves the immune system, circulation, and blockages all while you're sleeping.
[01:34:07.614 --> 01:34:11.337]  Very simply, you put one pad on each foot before bedtime and go to sleep.
[01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:14.980]  And when you wake up, the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.061]  You peel them off and throw them away.
[01:34:17.201 --> 01:34:18.002]  It's that simple.
[01:34:18.102 --> 01:34:19.863]  Call 908-691-2608.
[01:34:20.823 --> 01:34:26.166]  We encourage our customers to detox in as many ways as possible to bring the body back to a balance.
[01:34:26.426 --> 01:34:29.428]  The average person is exposed to hundreds of chemicals daily.
[01:34:29.548 --> 01:34:32.429]  This is one of the many powerful ways to detox the body.
[01:34:32.589 --> 01:34:37.192]  We recommend you try our Detoxer Foot Pads and see and feel the difference for yourself.

[01:34:53.902 --> 01:34:59.946]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:35:00.546 --> 01:35:03.528]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:05.293 --> 01:35:06.694]  Well, he's an amazing individual.
[01:35:06.774 --> 01:35:10.275]  Timothy F. Ball writes for major publications, books, you name it.
[01:35:11.196 --> 01:35:15.718]  Mr. Ball, tell us about some of your writing, some of your books, some of your info, where we can find out more about that.
[01:35:16.829 --> 01:35:27.212]  Well, we've got a website, the Natural Resources Stewardship Project, which is focusing on climate change right now, but we need to look at all the resources and get a good handle on those.
[01:35:27.573 --> 01:35:29.373]  And that's at nrsp.com.
[01:35:30.133 --> 01:35:35.495]  I also help set up and advise the Friends of Science group at friendsofscience.org.
[01:35:36.315 --> 01:35:39.977]  And I'm still publishing, even though I'm technically retired.
[01:35:40.797 --> 01:35:44.018]  I write articles on a regular basis for Canada Free Press.
[01:35:44.682 --> 01:35:55.567]  I was doing an article for 17 years for farmers in a magazine called Country Guide, and then I guess I got politically incorrect and they let me go, but the farmers need the help and the information to understand what's going on.
[01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:03.911]  Come by the hardware store.
[01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:04.732]  We're green.
[01:36:04.812 --> 01:36:05.953]  It's the green living.
[01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:07.294]  You've got to do it.
[01:36:07.334 --> 01:36:10.096]  I mean, it's a total takeover of society.
[01:36:10.136 --> 01:36:16.322]  It's a new religion where they boss you around and Whole Foods here in Austin says, we don't have plastic bags anymore.
[01:36:16.362 --> 01:36:18.624]  And, you know, I'm just tired of it.
[01:36:18.644 --> 01:36:18.944]  Go ahead.
[01:36:19.624 --> 01:36:22.907]  Well, of course, what they've done is they take the moral high ground.
[01:36:22.967 --> 01:36:28.912]  And so when people like me stand up and try to argue, you know, they can look down on you and say, well, you're not green.
[01:36:28.952 --> 01:36:29.493]  You don't care.
[01:36:30.194 --> 01:36:38.800]  And anybody that dares to question, and I think that's one of the frightening things, is vast segments of the society that are bullied into silence by these people.
[01:36:39.421 --> 01:36:51.590]  And you see, I see with the politicians, I mean, behind the fence they'll say to you, yeah, we agree with you, we know what the science is saying and so on, but we daren't show anything to suggest that we're not totally environmental.
[01:36:51.650 --> 01:36:52.650]  They also lie!
[01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:54.051]  They also lie!
[01:36:54.292 --> 01:36:54.992]  They also lie!
[01:36:55.032 --> 01:36:57.114]  They say, no scientist on Earth
[01:36:57.918 --> 01:36:58.098]  Yeah.
[01:36:58.799 --> 01:36:59.879]  Believes it's not real.
[01:36:59.919 --> 01:37:00.219]  We have 2,000.
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.742]  And then it just turns out they just put people's names on it.
[01:37:04.542 --> 01:37:10.606]  Yeah, well, of course, that's the numbers game, and it is a consensus thing, and consensus is not a scientific fact.
[01:37:12.347 --> 01:37:14.228]  But consensus works in politics.
[01:37:14.748 --> 01:37:21.412]  And the number, by the way, that they use is the 2,500 people of the IPCC, this Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[01:37:22.013 --> 01:37:26.996]  And the guy that was responsible for setting that up was the guy I mentioned earlier, Maurice Strong.
[01:37:27.552 --> 01:37:40.500]  And he's there with George Soros and all of those people, and he set up the United Nations Environmental Program, in which they defined that if they're going to study climate, they can only look at human effects on climate.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.282]  Ignore what natural climate is, and only look at the human portion.
[01:37:44.322 --> 01:37:49.185]  Well, how can you possibly know whether humans are having an effect if you don't know how the climate changes naturally?
[01:37:49.525 --> 01:37:50.765]  But that's their mandate.
[01:37:51.286 --> 01:37:53.187]  And of course, with the authority of the UN,
[01:37:53.746 --> 01:38:06.931]  And Strong is on record as saying he chose the UN because he could appoint the people he wanted, he could get all the money he wanted, he had no control, he didn't have to run for election or anything else.
[01:38:07.631 --> 01:38:08.512]  And the IPCC is the 2,500.
[01:38:08.552 --> 01:38:09.152]  But of the 2,500, Alex, 1,900 of them
[01:38:14.667 --> 01:38:17.930]  People are not looking at climate change in science.
[01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:22.813]  They're looking at, okay, let's accept that humans are causing it, and what are the impacts going to be?
[01:38:22.973 --> 01:38:23.414]  Exactly.
[01:38:23.454 --> 01:38:26.916]  The meeting was about what they were going to do about man-made global warming.
[01:38:27.217 --> 01:38:32.561]  It wasn't a scientific treatise and manifesto and declaration of fact.
[01:38:32.841 --> 01:38:39.546]  And then thousands of them who have been associated with this and other programs have come public and said, I didn't agree to all this.
[01:38:39.646 --> 01:38:44.210]  I just was invited and paid and flown there, and they put my name on this.
[01:38:45.151 --> 01:38:50.334]  Exactly, and a lot of them have quit over it, but that's where the consensus number comes from.
[01:38:50.414 --> 01:38:56.958]  And by the way, of the 2,500, less than 300 were involved in the actual science.
[01:38:57.399 --> 01:39:04.843]  And to show you how political it is, the mandate or the rules say that you publish the summary first.
[01:39:05.223 --> 01:39:06.504]  You put that out to the public.
[01:39:06.844 --> 01:39:09.086]  The summary is the political statement.
[01:39:10.214 --> 01:39:15.638]  Or that's like if I tell my accountant, hey this is how many taxes I owe, make sure all the accounting you do matches that.
[01:39:34.032 --> 01:39:34.593]  Exactly!
[01:39:34.913 --> 01:39:46.342]  And this is what they've done, and it's through that UN and the IPCC, and of course then the specific focus on CO2, which we already talked about, to bring these things down.
[01:39:46.943 --> 01:40:00.574]  And within those reports, by the way, they leave out, and they're computer models, and of course these are the same models that can't tell you what the weather's going to be like 10 days from now, and yet they're quite certain of what's going to happen 50 and 100 years from now.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:09.470]  It's all based on computer models, but in those computer models they leave out huge parts of what we know.
[01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:09.831]  That's right.
[01:40:09.891 --> 01:40:11.613]  These aren't even the classic models.
[01:40:11.653 --> 01:40:16.040]  These are, it's been admitted, fixed models where they build it for the result they want.
[01:40:16.809 --> 01:40:17.009]  Yep.
[01:40:17.449 --> 01:40:23.231]  And of course, one of them, as we've already mentioned, they build in the fact that if the CO2 increases, the temperature will go up.
[01:40:23.591 --> 01:40:27.473]  Yet all of the natural evidence shows us that it's exactly the other way around.
[01:40:27.873 --> 01:40:30.434]  That the temperature increases before the CO2.
[01:40:31.554 --> 01:40:38.297]  So every time you look at something, you can see how they've manipulated to achieve the result that they want.
[01:40:38.377 --> 01:40:41.078]  So it's literally garbage in, garbage out.
[01:40:41.718 --> 01:40:45.019]  And I mentioned already the one about the orbit of the Earth around the Sun.
[01:40:45.966 --> 01:40:48.868]  None of that, that's called the Milankovitch effect.
[01:40:49.268 --> 01:40:51.369]  None of that is included in their climate models.
[01:40:52.009 --> 01:40:55.151]  Yet every single year the orbit's different and that changes the climate.
[01:40:55.911 --> 01:41:05.937]  And Alex, all you've got to think about is just 22,000 years ago, which is something even humans can get their mind around, 22,000 years ago, all of Canada and a portion of the U.S.
[01:41:05.957 --> 01:41:09.238]  was covered with an ice sheet larger than the current Antarctic ice sheet.
[01:41:09.318 --> 01:41:12.360]  Oh, I know, there's giant glacial rocks right here in Texas.
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:13.741]  Right, exactly.
[01:41:14.645 --> 01:41:17.867]  Yeah, and that ice sheet, by the way, melted in about 5,000 years.
[01:41:18.507 --> 01:41:20.328]  Tell me where the heat came from to melt that ice?
[01:41:20.368 --> 01:41:22.609]  The Hyborian maxim came from the sun.
[01:41:23.409 --> 01:41:24.270]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:25.971]  But, of course, they ignore the sun.
[01:41:26.011 --> 01:41:28.232]  They say, oh no, they look in the textbooks.
[01:41:28.352 --> 01:41:30.253]  It tells you it's a solar constant.
[01:41:30.673 --> 01:41:31.934]  It's anything but constant.
[01:41:32.014 --> 01:41:33.194]  I know, they just lie!
[01:41:33.835 --> 01:41:34.535]  It's incredible!
[01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:36.216]  They say the sun never changes.
[01:41:36.436 --> 01:41:42.059]  When that's the oldest thing studied, the Egyptians put on their walls that the sun changed.
[01:41:42.739 --> 01:41:42.899]  Yep.
[01:41:42.919 --> 01:41:51.667]  I mean, everybody knows the sun heats up and cools down and expands and contracts and throws off different Coriolis super-ejections.
[01:41:52.267 --> 01:41:53.228]  Yep, exactly.
[01:41:53.988 --> 01:42:00.274]  And, of course, one of the things that we know about is that the global temperature varies with the number of sunspots.
[01:42:00.774 --> 01:42:03.677]  Basically, when there's more sunspots, the Earth is warmer.
[01:42:03.717 --> 01:42:05.218]  When there's less, the Earth is cooler.
[01:42:05.856 --> 01:42:10.198]  And by the way, we've had no sunspots for over a year now, which is why we've got cold temperatures right now.
[01:42:10.218 --> 01:42:25.607]  Which for those who don't know, those are huge explosions, those are huge ejections coming off of it that are so powerful that when our astronauts are in space and one goes off, they have to come back down out of orbit or they have to get behind the water tanks.
[01:42:26.367 --> 01:42:27.108]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:27.148 --> 01:42:28.488]  They've got to be protected from it.
[01:42:28.808 --> 01:42:31.330]  Well, we've got the Earth's magnetic field that's protecting us.
[01:42:32.006 --> 01:42:43.652]  And of course we can... But I've had the other scientists on about how even the particles from the sun, you know, not just the radiation, the particles come in, and then those form clouds, and it's just... Exactly.
[01:42:43.973 --> 01:42:44.693]  Yeah, that's the point.
[01:42:44.713 --> 01:42:47.134]  That's the cosmic theory of Sven Mark.
[01:42:47.374 --> 01:42:53.238]  But you see, the reason they said, okay, yeah, there's a high correlation between sunspots and global temperature, but what's the mechanism?
[01:42:53.358 --> 01:42:55.639]  Well, we don't know the mechanism, so we're going to ignore it.
[01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:58.886]  And so they left that out of their computer models.
[01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:00.267]  But here's another big one, Doctor.
[01:43:00.287 --> 01:43:01.408]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:43:01.428 --> 01:43:03.270]  I'm sorry we're moving so fast, but you're just amazing.
[01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:06.333]  I've got to get you up for two hours in the near future so we can really break this down.
[01:43:07.274 --> 01:43:15.762]  For the last 20 years, all the planets, their moons, have been melting, liquid moons, moons that were ice or liquid.
[01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:18.005]  They admit the whole solar system was heating.
[01:43:18.405 --> 01:43:24.510]  And I brought that up to David Rothschild, who ran the New York Live Earth thing a few months ago last year.
[01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:27.632]  And he said, well, that's because Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun.
[01:43:28.032 --> 01:43:28.993]  And I said, no, they're not.
[01:43:29.013 --> 01:43:30.794]  And he said, no, they are closer to the Sun.
[01:43:31.374 --> 01:43:37.339]  And either is he that dumb, the guy's worth billions, or does he think my audience is so dumb he can just bluff?
[01:43:38.374 --> 01:43:41.495]  Well, exactly, and that goes back to the thing that I said to you about.
[01:43:42.396 --> 01:43:45.057]  They work on people's lack of knowledge.
[01:43:45.537 --> 01:43:47.878]  But every once in a while, they get caught in these lies.
[01:43:48.318 --> 01:43:49.238]  And that's an example.
[01:43:49.258 --> 01:43:53.920]  Well, for those that don't know, Professor, is Jupiter closer to the Sun than the Earth?
[01:43:55.201 --> 01:43:55.401]  No.
[01:43:56.561 --> 01:43:58.202]  But see, Rothschild just says you're wrong.
[01:43:58.222 --> 01:44:02.504]  Yeah, well, what are we, the fourth planet out from the Sun?
[01:44:03.613 --> 01:44:07.959]  There's only three inside of us, isn't there?
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.301]  Jupiter's much further out.
[01:44:09.341 --> 01:44:10.243]  Yeah, it's third rock.
[01:44:10.323 --> 01:44:14.970]  It's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and then you get the gas giants.
[01:44:15.404 --> 01:44:15.924]  There you go.
[01:44:16.165 --> 01:44:16.665]  Exactly.
[01:44:17.265 --> 01:44:17.786]  Exactly.
[01:44:17.926 --> 01:44:35.098]  And of course the fact that the Mars polar ice cap is melting when there's no greenhouse gases there, it's clearly related to... Oh, by the way, I'm not attacking Robert Kennedy Jr., but we brought up to him in a video interview, he said, well, why are you saying global warming?
[01:44:35.218 --> 01:44:36.359]  We've got to have global tax.
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:42.203]  You know, Mars' ice caps are melting at a couple of miles a year at just incredible pace.
[01:44:42.243 --> 01:44:44.145]  And he said, there's no ice cap on Mars.
[01:44:45.427 --> 01:44:46.368]  And just laughed at us.
[01:44:46.428 --> 01:44:48.029]  I mean, it's got huge ice caps.
[01:44:48.969 --> 01:44:49.770]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:53.152]  But you see, this is the game, and I'll give you another example of how they do it.
[01:44:53.672 --> 01:44:56.974]  You keep hearing about the Arctic ice and, of course, the polar bears and all of that.
[01:44:57.014 --> 01:45:00.717]  And by the way, the polar bear numbers are increasing dramatically, and I'll come to that in a minute.
[01:45:00.737 --> 01:45:04.399]  They show film of it on an iceberg and say, look, they're going to die.
[01:45:04.439 --> 01:45:07.621]  They can't swim when they swim 200 miles and kill belugas.
[01:45:08.641 --> 01:45:14.204]  Well, exactly, and I flew Search and Rescue in the Arctic, and I've seen polar bears up to 180 miles offshore.
[01:45:14.684 --> 01:45:18.246]  And one of the reasons they're good swimmers is because they've got two furs.
[01:45:18.266 --> 01:45:25.209]  They've got the short fur close to their body that keeps the heat in so efficiently, by the way, that they don't even show up on infrared cameras.
[01:45:25.829 --> 01:45:37.414]  But also, the long fur is hollow, and the sunlight hits that and goes down into the body to heat the body, but because it's hollow, that long fur allows them to float very easily.
[01:45:37.494 --> 01:45:38.474]  Incredible creatures.
[01:45:39.275 --> 01:45:40.215]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:40.235 --> 01:45:41.916]  They're adapted to the environment.
[01:45:42.236 --> 01:45:49.379]  But the point about the Arctic ice is, you see, most of the people have no idea what the Arctic Ocean looks like or how big it is.
[01:45:50.137 --> 01:45:51.477]  And so they can play on that.
[01:45:51.497 --> 01:45:56.979]  For most people, the Arctic Ocean is just a line across the top of the map on the school wall.
[01:45:57.039 --> 01:45:57.999]  It's always breaking.
[01:45:58.039 --> 01:46:01.160]  It's always being replenished by rain and then breaking off.
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:02.700]  Yeah, but you know how much?
[01:46:03.961 --> 01:46:11.302]  In the Arctic, about 16 million square kilometers of ice forms every year, every winter.
[01:46:11.823 --> 01:46:13.423]  That's the amount that's up there right now.
[01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:18.384]  And every summer, 10 million square kilometers of that melts.
[01:46:18.984 --> 01:46:21.505]  Now that's an area equal to the U.S.
[01:46:22.326 --> 01:46:23.827]  Melts every single summer.
[01:46:24.107 --> 01:46:27.509]  In fact, 10 million square kilometers of ice melts in about 150 days.
[01:46:29.913 --> 01:46:33.535]  And yet they tell you, oh no, it's more melting this year than last year.
[01:46:33.875 --> 01:46:38.598]  And the way they play the game is they say, oh, more melted this year than last year.
[01:46:38.638 --> 01:46:40.078]  An area the size of Texas.
[01:46:40.158 --> 01:46:41.239]  Well, of course, they know.
[01:46:41.299 --> 01:46:43.220]  Everybody thinks, oh, Texas, that's big.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:44.701]  But actually... Stay there.
[01:46:44.741 --> 01:46:45.881]  Let's talk about this fraud.
[01:46:45.921 --> 01:46:47.902]  Let's talk about the fraud in the final segment.
[01:46:48.303 --> 01:46:49.263]  Absolute scam.
[01:46:53.105 --> 01:46:53.905]  It is a big idea.
[01:46:53.925 --> 01:46:55.426]  Let me talk to him.
[01:46:55.446 --> 01:46:55.826]  One second.
[01:46:58.548 --> 01:46:58.848]  Go ahead.
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.762]  Oh, no, it's more melting this year than last year.
[01:47:06.102 --> 01:47:10.845]  And the way they played the game is they said, oh, well, more melted this year than last year.
[01:47:10.885 --> 01:47:12.326]  An area the size of Texas.
[01:47:12.386 --> 01:47:15.448]  Well, of course, they know everybody thinks, oh, Texas, that's big.
[01:47:16.048 --> 01:47:17.009]  But actually... Stay there.
[01:47:17.029 --> 01:47:18.190]  Let's talk about this fraud.
[01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:20.211]  Let's talk about the fraud in the final segment.
[01:47:20.611 --> 01:47:21.592]  Absolute scam.
[01:47:24.434 --> 01:47:28.336]  Before an audience and say, you know, let me tell you some animals that are doing very well.
[01:47:28.937 --> 01:47:31.979]  Rats, coyotes, snakes, pigeons.
[01:47:32.509 --> 01:47:34.871]  And then I'll stop and I say, have I mentioned any you like yet?
[01:47:35.952 --> 01:47:36.692]  Right?
[01:47:36.792 --> 01:47:41.836]  And of course what you see is that they, again, they play on the emotional thing all the time.
[01:47:43.223 --> 01:48:02.948]  Well, exactly, but I mean, in textbooks, they admit that they can swim 200 miles, they hunt on ice packs, going back to the Titanic in an iceberg, rain increases the size of the Arctic masses, then it breaks off, as you said, the size of the U.S., and then on the news they say polar bears can't swim, this family's trapped, they're gonna die.
[01:48:03.168 --> 01:48:08.469]  The news knows they're lying, and the public's so dumb, they don't know that that's a complete fraud.
[01:48:09.235 --> 01:48:17.435]  Well, then that's what they're playing on, and as I said, to be at that fear... I mean, the one thing these people are very clever about is knowing how to exploit people.
[01:48:18.541 --> 01:48:22.884]  Well, I'll tell you what, we're going to come back in just a few minutes, and I'm sorry I'm jumping in so much, it's just so exciting.
[01:48:22.924 --> 01:48:23.825]  No, no, no, that's fine.
[01:48:23.885 --> 01:48:25.106]  I want to set you up... I'm talking too much.
[01:48:25.526 --> 01:48:26.407]  No, no, no, it's great.
[01:48:27.307 --> 01:48:34.373]  I want to set you up for a full two hours to really lay out, with all your research, sir, what's going on, and then hopefully how to stop it.
[01:48:34.393 --> 01:48:42.699]  So I'm going to have my producer call you today and try to set you up in the next month for two hours, and we're going to be back live in two minutes, and we'll go straight to you, okay?
[01:48:43.319 --> 01:48:43.980]  Okay, thank you.

[01:51:11.652 --> 01:51:16.794]  They got a martial law drill going on noon to 8 p.m.
[01:51:16.834 --> 01:51:18.034]  today in Austin, Texas.
[01:51:18.074 --> 01:51:24.716]  Law enforcement agencies are participating in a large-scale drill at the Olton Court of University near I-35.
[01:51:25.156 --> 01:51:28.997]  This is from one of our local news anchor sources.
[01:51:29.177 --> 01:51:30.698]  So this is confirmed.
[01:51:33.294 --> 01:51:42.838]  Now, they're doing martial law takeover drills everywhere to keep you safe from what the CFR head said was also their other fake threat to wage war against you and your family.
[01:51:43.919 --> 01:51:45.760]  The average cop being part of this doesn't even know that.
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:46.680]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:51:47.441 --> 01:51:59.466]  Finishing up with our guest, who I want to have back up for two hours in the near future, Timothy F. Ball, doctor, professor, PhD, expert on water, you name it, what's really happening with the hydrosphere, the atmospheres, the environment.
[01:52:00.627 --> 01:52:02.828]  Continuing, sir, in closing with...
[01:52:03.228 --> 01:52:04.708]  Yeah, just use one of their big lies.
[01:52:04.728 --> 01:52:09.850]  We'll have you back for their thousands of lies about how they point at glaciers and go, look, it's collapsing!
[01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:10.810]  Oh, it's dying!
[01:52:11.210 --> 01:52:11.950]  The water!
[01:52:11.970 --> 01:52:13.771]  There's cliffs falling!
[01:52:14.171 --> 01:52:17.531]  Well, that's always happened, but the public can't find the U.S.
[01:52:17.591 --> 01:52:18.012]  on a map.
[01:52:18.052 --> 01:52:19.332]  I'm not being mean, it's just true.
[01:52:19.752 --> 01:52:22.873]  They don't know who the Vice President is, so they believe the Earth is over.
[01:52:23.173 --> 01:52:24.173]  Polar bears are drowning.
[01:52:24.213 --> 01:52:24.993]  They can't swim.
[01:52:25.233 --> 01:52:26.013]  We're all dead.
[01:52:26.594 --> 01:52:27.934]  You've got the floor in the last four minutes.
[01:52:29.105 --> 01:52:35.107]  Yeah, and of course, the glacier issue, it speaks to the one that Al Gore knows is critical.
[01:52:35.528 --> 01:52:38.029]  Because if you say to people, well, what's wrong with global warming?
[01:52:39.149 --> 01:52:45.392]  All you hear about is that it's negative, it's bad, but for a great many things, it's a positive thing.
[01:52:45.432 --> 01:52:49.733]  In fact, when the world is warmer, generally the flora and the fauna are better off.
[01:52:50.393 --> 01:52:54.055]  And so you really push them on it, and then they'll say, oh, well, the sea level's going to rise.
[01:52:55.007 --> 01:53:06.833]  And that's why so much of Gore's movie is with that computer-generated, oh, here's the sea level flooding New York and Florida and so on, because he knows that's a huge concern to people.
[01:53:07.973 --> 01:53:10.995]  But it really is absolute nonsense.
[01:53:12.056 --> 01:53:16.359]  I mean, first of all, for Antarctica, you've got three types of ice down there.
[01:53:16.759 --> 01:53:19.601]  They never distinguish between them when they put out the stories.
[01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:24.723]  You've got the actual ice cap itself, which is actually increasing in size, not decreasing.
[01:53:25.144 --> 01:53:28.966]  The South Pole has been cooling since they've been keeping temperatures there, not warming.
[01:53:29.617 --> 01:53:32.678]  And then you've got around the edge, you've got what they call shelf ice.
[01:53:32.718 --> 01:53:38.421]  That is, as the big glacier pushes out into the ocean, these flat tabular ice sheets form.
[01:53:38.901 --> 01:53:43.122]  And of course they are pushed up and down by the tides and the waves and so on.
[01:53:43.683 --> 01:53:49.405]  And eventually they break off and then you hear, oh here's another big iceberg breaking off and this is global warming.
[01:53:50.165 --> 01:53:54.607]  I've got one record from a sailing ship back in the 1840s of an ice island 100 miles long and 40 miles wide.
[01:53:57.273 --> 01:53:59.081]  And the ship sailed around it to measure it.
[01:53:59.644 --> 01:54:02.496]  And that was long before there was any human global warming.
[01:54:03.115 --> 01:54:07.458]  And then you've got the sea ice forming around Antarctica, which is different again.
[01:54:07.478 --> 01:54:15.763]  And it goes from about 2 million square kilometers in the summer out to about 15 million square kilometers in the wintertime.
[01:54:16.683 --> 01:54:18.644]  So it's a constant change.
[01:54:19.045 --> 01:54:21.686]  And that's the key issue that they play on.
[01:54:22.067 --> 01:54:23.467]  And they're doing it with the glaciers.
[01:54:23.547 --> 01:54:27.350]  We're only monitoring about 10% of the world's alpine glaciers.
[01:54:27.370 --> 01:54:29.911]  50% of them are advancing, 50% are retreating.
[01:54:31.836 --> 01:54:37.359]  Because glaciers are as much about the amount of snowfall that's occurring as they are about the temperature.
[01:54:37.839 --> 01:54:42.622]  But they pick on the ones that are retreating and say, oh, here's the proof of it, and it's definitely due to warming.
[01:54:43.082 --> 01:54:44.883]  Gore did it with Kilimanjaro.
[01:54:44.903 --> 01:54:50.806]  And of course, there's been no global warming around there, as all the temperature records show.
[01:54:51.912 --> 01:55:14.357]  Well, I mean, to make it simple, it rains, and then it piles up, and then the glaciers push out towards the water, they pile up and then slough off, and both of the Arctics, the Antarctic and the Arctic, North and South, are actually getting bigger right now, just from the surveys that have been done, and that's an admitted fact, but it doesn't matter.
[01:55:14.798 --> 01:55:16.021]  They'll just run around fear-mongering.
[01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:24.240]  I mean, take Greenland, with all those aircraft that were left in World War II, and now they're 50, 60, 100 feet, depending on the area, under ice.
[01:55:24.943 --> 01:55:26.024]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:26.204 --> 01:55:36.571]  And of course, the sea level thing, you see, if you melt... What happened with that originally, Alex, was that the scientists said, OK, if we melt the Greenland and Antarctica, how much water is created?
[01:55:36.591 --> 01:55:39.232]  And they simply added that to the current sea level.
[01:55:39.773 --> 01:55:44.436]  But the problem with that is that most of that ice is already below sea level.
[01:55:45.057 --> 01:55:47.319]  So it wouldn't add to the sea level at all.
[01:55:47.779 --> 01:55:50.841]  It would simply occupy the space that's occupied by the ice.
[01:55:51.222 --> 01:55:56.085]  So the only part that would add to sea level is the part that's above current sea level.
[01:55:56.506 --> 01:56:00.148]  But then there's other adjustments go on because the land rises and falls.
[01:56:00.669 --> 01:56:04.652]  So you can stand, for example, you can stand on the Gulf Coast of Mexico down there in Texas.
[01:56:05.773 --> 01:56:10.957]  The sea level seems to be changing, but is it because the sea level's going up and down or because the land's going up and down?
[01:56:11.457 --> 01:56:14.019]  In the case of the Gulf of Mexico, the land is sinking.
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.221]  So it appears that the water's coming in.
[01:56:16.281 --> 01:56:18.603]  Oh, the sea level's rising due to global warming.
[01:56:18.643 --> 01:56:20.225]  No, it isn't, because the land's going down.
[01:56:21.125 --> 01:56:23.928]  Everywhere you look, you see this kind of misinformation.
[01:56:24.008 --> 01:56:25.809]  Sir, where can we read more of your work again?
[01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:31.514]  Well, on NRSP.com and also the articles I do in Canada Free Press.
[01:56:32.628 --> 01:56:36.730]  Well, I look forward to speaking to you again, Mr. Ball, Professor Ball, in the near future.
[01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:38.130]  God bless your fine research.
[01:56:38.750 --> 01:56:39.391]  Well, thank you.
[01:56:39.411 --> 01:56:41.891]  Thanks for the opportunity, and I'm John Armstrong.
[01:56:41.951 --> 01:56:42.612]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:42.692 --> 01:56:42.992]  Thank you.
[01:56:43.032 --> 01:56:43.872]  We're on the march.
[01:56:44.352 --> 01:56:45.013]  The Empire.
[01:56:45.193 --> 01:56:45.993]  You want to say goodbye to him?
[01:56:46.013 --> 01:56:46.653]  Yeah, let me say bye.
[01:56:48.074 --> 01:56:48.434]  Go ahead.
[01:56:48.794 --> 01:56:50.274]  Hey, Professor, we'll talk to you soon.
[01:56:50.315 --> 01:56:53.096]  I'm going to have my producer call you, and thank you for all the time.
[01:56:53.796 --> 01:56:54.616]  I appreciate that.
[01:56:54.656 --> 01:56:59.658]  Yeah, lots more we can talk about, and answer the questions, and educate the people so they can't be taken advantage of.
[01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.669]  Absolutely.
[01:57:00.749 --> 01:57:05.171]  It's like the guy said, if you think education is expensive, try ignorance.
[01:57:05.331 --> 01:57:05.691]  I know.
[01:57:05.991 --> 01:57:07.872]  Well, the people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:57:07.912 --> 01:57:08.452]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:08.572 --> 01:57:09.993]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:10.253 --> 01:57:10.553]  Good.
[01:57:10.573 --> 01:57:11.313]  Thanks very kindly.
[01:57:11.373 --> 01:57:11.873]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:12.334 --> 01:57:13.814]  Okay, thank you, Professor.
[01:57:14.034 --> 01:57:15.515]  Go ahead and you got Shostakovich on?
[01:57:15.675 --> 01:57:16.355]  Yep, I sure do.
[01:57:16.375 --> 01:57:17.415]  I just have to transfer him over.
[01:57:17.436 --> 01:57:21.097]  Alright, just let him know, in case Trey didn't tell him, I want to get into Iran.
[01:57:21.137 --> 01:57:21.477]  Here we go.
[01:57:21.737 --> 01:57:22.777]  Okay, what about this clip?
[01:57:22.798 --> 01:57:23.918]  Did you want to save it for later?
[01:57:23.958 --> 01:57:24.598]  How long is it?
[01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:26.899]  Four minutes.
[01:57:27.579 --> 01:57:28.560]  We'll play it in the last segment.
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:28.900]  Stand by.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:34.421]  Alright sir, let's sit tight.
[01:57:34.561 --> 01:57:39.026]  I'll go and transfer you over and you'll be live in just a couple minutes.
[01:57:42.951 --> 01:57:43.431]  Thank you sir.
[01:57:45.093 --> 01:57:45.534]  Alright.
[01:57:48.297 --> 01:57:48.557]  That's 312-224-2710.
[01:57:55.544 --> 01:57:58.487]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[01:57:58.948 --> 01:58:03.072]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[01:58:03.773 --> 01:58:05.435]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[01:58:06.263 --> 01:58:10.286]  T-BoTech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.
[01:58:10.306 --> 01:58:15.590]  Specializes in miniature attack, dwarfs, T-Borrel attack cruisers, and more.
[01:58:15.610 --> 01:58:19.133]  T-BoTech will arm you with the most advanced non-lethal products anywhere on the net.
[01:58:19.213 --> 01:58:20.134]  Super behind the scenes.
[01:58:20.154 --> 01:58:20.714]  Not sure where to start?
[01:58:21.154 --> 01:58:24.517]  The T-BoTech Essentials Package is great for you or to share with your family.
[01:58:25.057 --> 01:58:35.746]  It comes with a 950,000 volt cell phone stun gun, a multi-pack of pepper sprays, an extremely loud personal alarm, and a how-to book for defending yourself with pepper spray, all at a low price.
[01:58:36.406 --> 01:58:42.513]  With these or any of Tebowtech's products, you have the tools to defend yourself against an attack and get yourself to safety.
[01:58:43.154 --> 01:58:43.935]  Don't be a victim.
[01:58:44.376 --> 01:58:45.036]  Be a victor.
[01:58:45.637 --> 01:58:46.338]  Stock up now.
[01:58:46.698 --> 01:58:47.900]  Tebowtech.com.
[01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.423]  That's T-B-O-T-E-C-H dot com.
[01:58:53.064 --> 01:58:56.565]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[01:58:56.825 --> 01:59:01.266]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[01:59:01.526 --> 01:59:06.408]  I have run across a company called SFR, who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[01:59:06.828 --> 01:59:17.831]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage in only one tank full.
[01:59:18.051 --> 01:59:20.412]  Protecta Engine Treatment not only reduces friction,
[01:59:20.812 --> 01:59:22.553]  But it extends the life of your engine.
[01:59:22.853 --> 01:59:23.514]  Let's face it.
[01:59:23.774 --> 01:59:26.315]  With the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[01:59:26.615 --> 01:59:34.140]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free.
[01:59:34.620 --> 01:59:36.701]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:59:36.921 --> 01:59:39.783]  That number again is 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:59:40.043 --> 01:59:43.805]  Or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[01:59:44.105 --> 01:59:45.826]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[01:59:46.287 --> 01:59:48.648]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:59:49.108 --> 01:59:50.548]  And it's safe for all cars.
[01:59:50.748 --> 01:59:51.169]  Act now.
[01:59:52.869 --> 01:59:59.911]  I've got to get Professor Michael Tosadowski on for an hour in the near future.
[01:59:59.931 --> 02:00:02.871]  We've only got him for about 15 minutes, 20 minutes right now.
[02:00:14.448 --> 02:00:19.531]  Because in the last five minutes, I'm going to play some excerpts of interviews with Debra Jean Palfrey, the D.C.
[02:00:19.551 --> 02:00:22.894]  madam who said she'd never commit suicide, even if she was convicted.
[02:00:23.574 --> 02:00:24.415]  She's now been murdered.
[02:00:24.475 --> 02:00:31.079]  Clearly, reportedly, she was about to release the fact that she had sent girls to some high-ranking White House folks.
[02:00:31.559 --> 02:00:33.601]  She never said who on air, never told me privately.
[02:00:33.621 --> 02:00:36.803]  That's the kind of thing I wouldn't want to know, that of being on air, because you get killed.
[02:00:37.163 --> 02:00:38.424]  No hit teams at my house, please.
[02:00:39.705 --> 02:00:40.886]  This is just horrible what happened.
[02:00:40.906 --> 02:00:42.287]  We'll play some of that in the last five minutes.
[02:00:42.807 --> 02:00:44.188]  But Professor Cha Sadowsky,
[02:00:45.688 --> 02:00:48.469]  As a Canadian economist, he heads up global research.
[02:00:48.929 --> 02:00:51.150]  He is a professor of economics at the University of Ottawa.
[02:00:51.170 --> 02:00:57.392]  Chodosky has taught, is a visiting professor at academic institutions in Western Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.
[02:00:58.192 --> 02:01:09.335]  He has acted as an economic advisor to governments in developed countries, has worked as the consultant for international organizations, including the UN Development Fund, the African Development Bank, the United Nations African Institute of Economic Development,
[02:01:10.131 --> 02:01:11.792]  The United Nations Population Fund.
[02:01:11.852 --> 02:01:14.954]  I mean, it goes on and on for ten years, but very well known.
[02:01:14.974 --> 02:01:18.816]  We'll tell you about some of his books and materials, like America's War on Terrorism.
[02:01:19.356 --> 02:01:22.718]  While we've got you today, sir, I want to just try to get boiled-down answers.
[02:01:23.678 --> 02:01:24.219]  Pick your brain.
[02:01:24.239 --> 02:01:25.179]  We appreciate you coming on.
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:28.701]  But first off, are they going into Iran?
[02:01:29.241 --> 02:01:31.763]  Ray McGovern, CIA analyst, is saying he thinks so.
[02:01:32.303 --> 02:01:33.424]  They're saber-rattling.
[02:01:33.744 --> 02:01:35.805]  Or is that off the table, like Jimmy Carter says?
[02:01:35.905 --> 02:01:36.966]  And then secondarily,
[02:01:38.137 --> 02:01:40.679]  Where do you think the economy's going with the international order?
[02:01:40.799 --> 02:01:51.890]  That's B. And then C. Of the three presidential candidates, I know it's all theater, but there's different fissures and different camps in the New World Order.
[02:01:52.190 --> 02:01:53.191]  Who do you think's behind who?
[02:01:53.211 --> 02:01:56.834]  I know that's a lot in 20 minutes, but you've got the field, sir.
[02:01:57.174 --> 02:02:01.138]  Well, Alex, it's just great to be on your program.
[02:02:02.869 --> 02:02:05.272]  These are, of course, far-reaching questions.
[02:02:05.892 --> 02:02:12.178]  I'll try to address the crucial question, will the war with Iran occur?
[02:02:13.339 --> 02:02:19.184]  I've been looking at this issue for the last, oh, I would say more than five years, certainly.
[02:02:20.265 --> 02:02:27.692]  Those war preparations started up in 2003 with Tehran, which was called Tehran Near Term.
[02:02:28.770 --> 02:02:32.413]  Those were war scenarios right after the invasion of Iraq.
[02:02:33.734 --> 02:02:38.678]  And there's been a military build-up from that period onwards.
[02:02:39.739 --> 02:02:47.626]  And it's only, I would say, in the last year that the mainstream press has actually addressed the issue of these war preparations.
[02:02:48.186 --> 02:02:52.550]  Now, I think one has to analyze this very carefully.
[02:02:53.571 --> 02:02:56.273]  First of all, war preparations
[02:02:57.173 --> 02:03:02.478]  Directed against the country do not signify necessarily that the war will occur.
[02:03:02.498 --> 02:03:04.820]  There are a number of factors.
[02:03:05.421 --> 02:03:12.988]  The ability of the country to defend itself against foreign aggression, in this case the United States, NATO and Israel.
[02:03:13.108 --> 02:03:14.389]  We know that's the alliance.
[02:03:15.931 --> 02:03:18.153]  Its military capabilities to defend itself.
[02:03:19.172 --> 02:03:21.634]  Uh, in other words, it's, uh, air defense system.
[02:03:22.255 --> 02:03:24.516]  It's, uh, capabilities to retaliate.
[02:03:24.576 --> 02:03:29.700]  That means it's missile ballistic system, which, which, um, uh, Iran
[02:03:30.385 --> 02:03:30.865]  I think?
[02:03:49.714 --> 02:03:54.757]  Several million land forces, soldiers.
[02:03:55.298 --> 02:04:00.181]  I'm not suggesting that they are as advanced or as sophisticated as the U.S.
[02:04:00.261 --> 02:04:04.503]  military, but bear in mind the geography.
[02:04:05.564 --> 02:04:08.046]  Basra is right on the Iranian border.
[02:04:08.526 --> 02:04:14.990]  And so the moment, and that's, again, the media... The Shiites are going to go completely wild all over Iraq.
[02:04:15.976 --> 02:04:18.697]  Yes, absolutely, that's exactly what will happen.
[02:04:18.737 --> 02:04:43.828]  They'll cross the border, and they'll ransack all the military installations, even if they're not, and of course, the US military in Iraq doesn't control the terrain, it doesn't control the country, so imagine what would happen if you have just a couple of hundred thousand Iranian troops cross the border into Iraq,
[02:04:44.668 --> 02:04:54.273]  That would be absolute chaos, it would mean immediate escalation, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff know that.
[02:04:54.493 --> 02:04:58.815]  They know that the US military cannot handle it.
[02:04:59.535 --> 02:05:07.639]  You have, of course, Admiral Fallon was fired for having more or less said that, but if you look at the statements of
[02:05:09.739 --> 02:05:16.101]  Of the new Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen, he says pretty much the same thing.
[02:05:16.601 --> 02:05:29.566]  And what's very significant is that when Admiral Michael Mullen was appointed as Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff back in October of last year, the first thing he said, he said it outright.
[02:05:33.942 --> 02:05:38.304]  And he didn't say it in any different way to Fallon.
[02:05:39.244 --> 02:05:41.645]  He said the risks could be very, very high.
[02:05:42.245 --> 02:05:43.246]  We're in a conflict.
[02:05:44.826 --> 02:05:53.350]  And we have to be incredibly thoughtful about the potential of getting into a conflict with a third country in that part of the world.
[02:05:53.690 --> 02:05:54.670]  Those were his words.
[02:05:55.110 --> 02:05:57.031]  And they were published in the Israeli press.
[02:05:57.571 --> 02:06:00.052]  And I presume that they were also quoted in the U.S.
[02:06:00.072 --> 02:06:00.172]  press.
[02:06:02.674 --> 02:06:05.997]  So that this consensus within the U.S.
[02:06:06.137 --> 02:06:15.524]  Armed Forces for an attack on Iran, hello, I don't believe it's as straightforward as what some people suggest.
[02:06:16.024 --> 02:06:32.037]  And the fact that Admiral Fallon has been dumped as commander of Central Command, which of course is a very important key position, that doesn't necessarily change the situation on the ground in Iraq.
[02:06:32.836 --> 02:06:34.417]  Now let me just add a little question here.
[02:06:34.477 --> 02:06:41.781]  We have Zbigniew Brzezinski coming out last year telling Congress to look for a false flag attack staged by the military, by our government.
[02:06:42.201 --> 02:06:46.244]  Then we have Gary Hart writing a letter to Tehran saying our government will stage attacks, you better watch it.
[02:06:46.864 --> 02:06:50.826]  A few days ago he told We Are Change New York that indeed the government may stage something.
[02:06:51.227 --> 02:06:52.167]  Now he's an insider.
[02:06:52.207 --> 02:06:55.229]  He helped write Homeland Security, clearly involved in 9-11.
[02:06:55.709 --> 02:06:58.691]  Why are we now seeing this split, or is this a real split?
[02:06:59.727 --> 02:07:03.209]  Well, I think it's certainly a split within the establishment.
[02:07:03.249 --> 02:07:11.112]  I mean, Brzezinski doesn't necessarily represent different power lobbies than the neocons.
[02:07:11.832 --> 02:07:26.619]  I think he's certainly a person who has a little bit more sense, and he believes in diplomacy, and I mean, under the circumstances, I think Brzezinski is certainly a positive
[02:07:27.877 --> 02:07:29.498]  What he says is positive.
[02:07:30.058 --> 02:07:33.378]  I don't doubt that Brzezinski still believes in U.S.
[02:07:34.819 --> 02:07:38.320]  dominance at the global level, as his publication suggests.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:39.880]  So, bottom line, what do you think is going to happen?
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:41.200]  You're saying there's an internal fight.
[02:07:41.761 --> 02:07:43.681]  Do you think they'll stage some provocation?
[02:07:44.921 --> 02:07:50.903]  The problem is that you have people who are not always sane in their minds.
[02:07:51.972 --> 02:08:03.047]  And you have a command structure within the Armed Forces, so that ultimately, even, it's not really the military that calls the shots, it's the civilians, okay?
[02:08:03.067 --> 02:08:09.095]  So that the orders will come from Dick Cheney, most probably, and his advisors.
[02:08:09.989 --> 02:08:18.412]  President Bush will sign whatever they stick in front of him, and you could very well have a situation which could get completely out of hand.
[02:08:18.472 --> 02:08:22.133]  Why does Israel want this, knowing that even if the U.S.
[02:08:22.173 --> 02:08:29.336]  has said, if Iran defends itself in any way, that will be seen as the greatest crime in galactic history, and that they'll have to be nuked?
[02:08:29.856 --> 02:08:32.937]  And so I guess Israel wants fallout, and they just love it.
[02:08:34.113 --> 02:08:45.655]  Well, Israel has been involved in advanced war preparation since 2004.
[02:08:45.975 --> 02:08:50.896]  Stockpiling tactical nuclear weapons, their own nuclear weapons, bunker busters.
[02:08:51.016 --> 02:08:56.037]  Are the people running our society just bored and they just want to see mushroom clouds?
[02:08:56.057 --> 02:08:58.758]  I mean, I guess it's like Hitler just wanted to have a war.
[02:08:59.298 --> 02:09:03.059]  Has it just come down to that, that these are guys that think it's tough to start wars?
[02:09:04.116 --> 02:09:22.400]  Well, I mean, the issue with nuclear weapons is that the whole nuclear doctrine has changed dramatically since 2002, with the Nuclear Posture Review, which states essentially that nuclear weapons are harmless to the surrounding civilian population.
[02:09:22.720 --> 02:09:30.242]  That goes into all the handbooks of the military, and now they've been reclassified and approved by the U.S.
[02:09:30.322 --> 02:09:33.003]  Senate for use in a conventional war theater.
[02:09:33.203 --> 02:09:45.971]  And now we learn that in 1959, the Joint Chiefs wanted to attack China during a Taiwan crisis, and they said in those documents, now released last week, that, oh, these are just like iron bombs.
[02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:53.076]  We ought to use these in every conflict, just as a conventional weapon, and Eisenhower had to say, no, that radiates people.
[02:09:54.332 --> 02:09:58.917]  Yeah, but I mean... So I guess now that policy... I mean, that policy's here now.
[02:09:59.658 --> 02:10:14.794]  Well, the thing is that with the tactical nuclear weapons, there's been a lot of propaganda by the Pentagon to present these mini-nukes as something different from a regular thermonuclear bomb, which they're not.
[02:10:15.396 --> 02:10:21.843]  They have less explosive capacity, between one third and six times a Hiroshima bomb.
[02:10:23.064 --> 02:10:23.905]  And they don't airburst.
[02:10:23.925 --> 02:10:24.485]  Let me stop you.
[02:10:24.525 --> 02:10:25.847]  They generally aren't airburst.
[02:10:26.207 --> 02:10:34.416]  And so when a hydrogen weapon goes off in contact with the soil and surrounding metals, it creates thousands of times the fallout.
[02:10:34.636 --> 02:10:36.338]  So they're actually more dirty from what I've seen.
[02:10:37.051 --> 02:10:42.613]  Well, I mean, again, that issue is probably debatable.
[02:10:42.713 --> 02:10:43.193]  I agree.
[02:10:44.273 --> 02:10:53.716]  What the Pentagon scientists are saying is that the tactical nuclear weapons, because they bunker-bust the bombs, they explode underground.
[02:10:54.116 --> 02:10:58.798]  But then when you look more carefully at the small print, they say 20 feet underground.
[02:10:58.838 --> 02:11:06.640]  Now, 20 feet underground is probably, you know, the size of a two-story, you know, a three-story house.
[02:11:07.188 --> 02:11:16.783]  So you could well imagine that everything will just simply explode, a big crater is formed, and of course you have radioactive fallout.
[02:11:17.364 --> 02:11:18.165]  You can't avoid that.
[02:11:18.225 --> 02:11:20.128]  That's the worst time when it detonates on the ground.
[02:11:22.179 --> 02:11:22.779]  Absolutely.
[02:11:23.339 --> 02:11:23.879]  Absolutely.
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:41.983]  But the thing is, I think that what we have are decision makers which are the victims of their own lies and propaganda, that they ultimately even believe that a nuclear device, a nuclear weapon, is some kind of a humanitarian bomb.
[02:11:42.064 --> 02:11:44.044]  And then they go along with that because it's
[02:11:44.484 --> 02:11:56.171]  They have a bunch of scientists at the research labs in Texas and California who say, well, yeah, go ahead and use them because they're safe for the surrounding civilian population.
[02:11:56.511 --> 02:12:03.695]  And incidentally... By the way, this is a major shift in their mindset because until 10 years ago, they admitted DU was deadly poison and killed the troops.
[02:12:04.175 --> 02:12:07.957]  Now they just threw all their real research out and said, it's good for you.
[02:12:08.257 --> 02:12:11.019]  I mean, it's craziness is now... Go ahead.
[02:12:11.659 --> 02:12:36.027]  Well, yeah, I mean, I think it goes back even further, because I recall when I started researching this, I went in and looked at Truman's diary before they dropped the nuclear, the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and in Truman's radio address, I think it was on the day that they bombed Nagasaki, 8th or 9th of August 1945,
[02:12:39.569 --> 02:12:48.679]  He confirmed that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.
[02:12:49.309 --> 02:12:55.814]  And that it was because we wanted to save the lives of innocent civilians, unquote.
[02:12:55.834 --> 02:12:56.935]  Incredible propaganda!
[02:12:57.715 --> 02:13:08.343]  And either Truman was poorly briefed as to where the bomb would be dropped, or that he went along, or that he was plain ignorant of the geography of Japan.
[02:13:09.271 --> 02:13:10.573]  Or a combination of that.
[02:13:11.493 --> 02:13:20.422]  But the whole notion of collateral damage has been ingrained in US nuclear weapons policy, I think, right from the beginning.
[02:13:21.519 --> 02:13:22.179]  Just amazing.
[02:13:22.199 --> 02:13:27.122]  I mean, we all know that targeted civilians, and we all know it was a terror weapon, and they'd already tried to surrender.
[02:13:27.162 --> 02:13:32.065]  But yeah, Truman spends it in a radio address of, don't worry, we bomb the military, not the people.
[02:13:32.445 --> 02:13:34.606]  And it's a tiny bomb anyways, it's no big deal.
[02:13:34.626 --> 02:13:35.967]  It was a friendly thing to do.
[02:13:36.487 --> 02:13:41.530]  I want to carry you through the break and just continue broadcasting during the break so we have time here to cover some of the other issues.
[02:13:41.590 --> 02:13:48.253]  Bottom line, in your gut, I know you don't want to be wrong, but, you know, they just said, we're sending a carrier, not to threaten them, but to let them know we're serious.
[02:13:48.573 --> 02:13:49.354]  More doublespeak.
[02:13:49.754 --> 02:13:51.176]  Do you think they're going to hit Iran?
[02:13:51.236 --> 02:13:53.077]  Do you agree with Ray McGovern and others?
[02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:57.481]  Do we get to that after the break now?
[02:13:57.501 --> 02:13:59.083]  No, no, we're not going to take a break.
[02:13:59.123 --> 02:13:59.924]  Just tell me.
[02:14:00.484 --> 02:14:00.965]  Oh, okay.
[02:14:01.025 --> 02:14:08.171]  Well, I'm not... I personally, if I look at the various countervailing forces,
[02:14:09.025 --> 02:14:14.786]  I would say that there are many factors which go against the war in Iraq.
[02:14:14.946 --> 02:14:16.306]  I tend to agree.
[02:14:17.347 --> 02:14:18.267]  I think it's lessening.
[02:14:18.867 --> 02:14:19.647]  I think it's lessening.
[02:14:19.927 --> 02:14:25.868]  You know, I said they probably weren't going to hit them two years ago and got called out that I wasn't, you know, the expert.
[02:14:26.608 --> 02:14:29.169]  But they could still stage something, couldn't they?
[02:14:29.329 --> 02:14:30.289]  Well, absolutely.
[02:14:30.329 --> 02:14:34.650]  Now, you mentioned the issue of the false flag attack for the second 9-11.
[02:14:35.490 --> 02:14:40.313]  Now the second 9-11 was announced by Dick Cheney quite a few years ago.
[02:14:40.893 --> 02:14:49.298]  He said that there's going to be a second 9-11 and I'm absolutely convinced that if there is a second 9-11, Iran will be behind it.
[02:14:49.699 --> 02:14:51.720]  So they've already planned that scenario.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:58.264]  And the Pentagon then released, there were some documents leased to the Washington Post where they said
[02:14:58.744 --> 02:15:07.329]  That a second 9-11 would be both an opportunity, a pretext and an opportunity which is lacking.
[02:15:07.989 --> 02:15:09.630]  I'm quoting from the document.
[02:15:10.030 --> 02:15:17.934]  So that the false flag attack on a US city, which would be an intelligence operation, is there.
[02:15:18.254 --> 02:15:24.378]  The problem is that there are too many people and people in high places that know
[02:15:25.118 --> 02:15:25.319]  That 9-11
[02:15:41.516 --> 02:15:54.341]  Best Actors 2008, and all these scientists, and CIA Section Chief Bill Christensen, and the former Italian President, and former German Defense Minister, and the polls showing the majority know it's an inside job.
[02:15:54.861 --> 02:16:00.504]  Are you saying we have effectively, at least partially, taken their tool, a false flag, and broken it in front of their faces?
[02:16:01.348 --> 02:16:05.092]  Well, it's a bit like crying wolf, huh?
[02:16:05.332 --> 02:16:18.907]  You know, there have been so many terror alerts and terror... Of course, we had the London bombings and we had the liquid bomb attack and we know that the liquid bomb attack was a fake because the
[02:16:19.808 --> 02:16:28.944]  The alleged hijackers didn't have passports and tickets to board the plane, as was revealed actually in, I think it was Newsweek that revealed it in the small print.
[02:16:28.984 --> 02:16:32.469]  Yeah, they have so overdone it all that it's obvious to everybody.
[02:16:33.243 --> 02:16:42.592]  Well, it's not obvious to everybody because you still have, you know, you've got CNN, you've got Fox News and the BBC, which will tell us otherwise.
[02:16:42.652 --> 02:16:46.376]  But again, people in high office in the U.S.
[02:16:46.456 --> 02:16:50.540]  Congress, the increasing numbers of people who are, you know,
[02:16:53.197 --> 02:17:08.691]  What the US administration calls top officials because they have these pop-off exercises, anti-terror exercises, where they have, you know, people from the municipalities, the federal, the state governments, involved in scenarios.
[02:17:09.292 --> 02:17:14.677]  And I think there are lots of people who are extremely skeptical.
[02:17:15.806 --> 02:17:18.052]  On 9-11.
[02:17:18.653 --> 02:17:22.022]  Certainly very skeptical on Iran as well.
[02:17:22.042 --> 02:17:24.688]  Professor, plug some of your websites right now before we go to break.
[02:17:25.831 --> 02:17:38.042]  Well, our website is www.globalresearch.ca, and my most recent book is called America's War on Terrorism.
[02:17:38.082 --> 02:17:38.482]  Stay there.
[02:17:39.343 --> 02:17:39.583]  Stay there.
[02:17:39.603 --> 02:17:40.844]  We've got a break, but we're not going to break.
[02:17:40.864 --> 02:17:45.248]  We're going to be live on the web right now for Infowars.com stream listeners.
[02:17:45.268 --> 02:17:45.749]  You've got to go there.
[02:17:45.769 --> 02:17:47.050]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:47.831]  Stay there, Professor.
[02:17:53.712 --> 02:17:58.454]  Okay, we've got three minutes left, sir, and we've still got a large portion of the audience listening.
[02:17:58.734 --> 02:18:03.196]  I'm going to have to let you go, but I want to get Trey to call you to set you up for, like, two hours in the near future.
[02:18:03.216 --> 02:18:04.236]  In fact, I wanted you for longer.
[02:18:04.296 --> 02:18:06.337]  I was surprised to only see you.
[02:18:06.357 --> 02:18:10.159]  Well, that way we can really break everything down and really, you know, give everybody your geopolitical view.
[02:18:10.399 --> 02:18:14.521]  But in three minutes, give me your take on the economy and then your take on the election.
[02:18:15.061 --> 02:18:16.121]  Are we on now?
[02:18:16.141 --> 02:18:16.761]  Yes, we're on now.
[02:18:16.801 --> 02:18:17.122]  Go ahead.
[02:18:18.142 --> 02:18:22.664]  On the economy, well, certainly I think some very serious
[02:18:23.759 --> 02:18:40.106]  Concerns with the rising price of food around the world, which is attributable to a speculative onslaught in the commodity markets, in the grain markets.
[02:18:41.447 --> 02:18:42.827]  It is a deliberate thing.
[02:18:43.668 --> 02:18:49.250]  It's triggering famine around the world because food prices have doubled, in some cases tripled.
[02:18:52.215 --> 02:19:03.062]  It's the response of the government and the authorities, I think, is dismal because what they're doing is they're sending in food aid.
[02:19:04.463 --> 02:19:05.644]  This crisis of
[02:19:06.574 --> 02:19:19.745]  of rising food prices can be resolved simply by freezing speculative transactions on the Chicago and New York mercantile exchanges.
[02:19:20.065 --> 02:19:29.052]  Yeah, not even price fixing, but just to put a ceiling on it where you can't exactly, and the Saudis have been caught being involved in that, correct?
[02:19:29.232 --> 02:19:31.595]  Well, yeah, but there's also such things as index funds.
[02:19:32.316 --> 02:19:40.806]  You're not even buying... It's not the regular futures market, you know, where people involved in trade are... They have to... It's groupings of it.
[02:19:41.167 --> 02:19:44.131]  Oh, it is betting on the movement.
[02:19:44.631 --> 02:19:46.053]  It's the same thing as short...
[02:19:47.214 --> 02:19:54.759]  It's the same mechanism applied to short-selling currencies, let's say in the Asian crisis.
[02:19:54.799 --> 02:19:56.480]  Okay, we're out of time, in one minute.
[02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:59.782]  I mean, all three candidates run by the same puppeteers?
[02:20:01.351 --> 02:20:03.532]  No, I don't think so.
[02:20:03.672 --> 02:20:12.874]  I mean, I think Obama, from my standpoint, is somebody who is articulate, who addresses issues, and so on.
[02:20:13.014 --> 02:20:15.055]  And Hillary, I think, is the one they're all behind.
[02:20:15.255 --> 02:20:17.095]  Hillary's the one with the big power behind her, right?
[02:20:17.215 --> 02:20:20.596]  That's why we have disinfo agents out saying Obama's the demon.
[02:20:21.809 --> 02:20:26.650]  Well, yeah, but I mean, Obama still has the corporate lobby behind him.
[02:20:26.730 --> 02:20:27.650]  We don't doubt that.
[02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:44.534]  But under the circumstances, it's better to have somebody like Obama than a clone of George W. Bush, which would be McCain, and who can be manipulated and who may lead us into World War III.
[02:20:44.674 --> 02:20:46.034]  Okay, Professor, we're out of time.
[02:20:46.054 --> 02:20:49.395]  I want to get you on for a full two hours, if not just an hour, in the next couple of weeks.
[02:20:49.435 --> 02:20:50.235]  I'll have Trey call you.
[02:20:50.255 --> 02:20:50.695]  Thank you, sir.
[02:20:51.488 --> 02:20:53.048]  It's a pleasure to be on your program.
[02:20:53.088 --> 02:20:53.488]  Take care.
[02:20:55.109 --> 02:21:03.771]  Yeah, if you go to InfoWars.com, listen to the streams there.
[02:21:03.791 --> 02:21:09.352]  We do a lot of behind-the-scenes interviews where it just continues for presentplanet.tv viewers.
[02:21:09.372 --> 02:21:13.613]  You have a 15-cent-a-day membership or for the free audio streams at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:13.873 --> 02:21:15.234]  A lot of radio show today.
[02:21:15.554 --> 02:21:20.035]  I'm going to end the main transmission with five minutes of Deborah Jean Palfrey
[02:21:20.915 --> 02:21:26.099]  On my show, just back in mid-March, she was killed, murdered.
[02:21:26.980 --> 02:21:30.282]  The disinfo agents are now saying they've confirmed that she hung herself.
[02:21:32.304 --> 02:21:34.205]  They murdered her, and this is how they do it.
[02:21:34.245 --> 02:21:39.669]  They killed one of the girls she had that was reportedly hooked in with the White House, and they'll probably kill more of these women.
[02:21:40.470 --> 02:21:46.737]  They could cut their heads off on TV and have guys in black uniforms do it and the public would say it was done by the Easter Bunny if the media told them.
[02:21:46.777 --> 02:21:48.519]  So here's this poor lady right now.
[02:21:48.539 --> 02:21:52.564]  I'm going to come back and go into overdrive on the Infowars.com audio streams.
[02:21:52.584 --> 02:21:54.126]  So let's go ahead and go to this.
[02:21:54.767 --> 02:21:58.050]  Well look, I mean, she's already dropped the atomic bomb on them.
[02:21:58.091 --> 02:21:59.893]  She's already released the numbers.
[02:22:00.393 --> 02:22:01.273]  Yeah, yeah, I have.
[02:22:01.393 --> 02:22:09.575]  And not to be concerned, I have no intention of letting anyone buy me off or make any kind of a deal with me.
[02:22:09.915 --> 02:22:11.535]  And you're not planning to commit suicide?
[02:22:11.755 --> 02:22:13.655]  And I'm not planning to commit suicide either.
[02:22:13.675 --> 02:22:19.116]  The fact that you're so visible really protects you going on Larry King and other big shows.
[02:22:19.136 --> 02:22:21.497]  But you want to put it on record that you're not planning to commit suicide?
[02:22:22.057 --> 02:22:23.957]  No, I'm not planning to commit suicide.
[02:22:23.977 --> 02:22:28.418]  I'm planning to go into court on April 7th if indeed we do have the trial.
[02:22:29.428 --> 02:22:39.130]  I plan on defending myself vigorously, and I plan on exposing the government in ways that, you know, I do not think they want me to expose them.
[02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:43.091]  I want them to explain to me in open court why they came after me.
[02:22:43.631 --> 02:22:45.872]  I mean, how would you not know that it was Cheney?
[02:22:45.992 --> 02:22:53.654]  And how do we know that Brandi Britton, one of your girls who committed suicide, didn't commit suicide?
[02:22:54.264 --> 02:22:55.484]  Well, we don't know about that.
[02:22:55.504 --> 02:22:56.985]  There's two schools of thought.
[02:22:57.185 --> 02:22:58.965]  One says yes, one says no.
[02:22:58.985 --> 02:23:02.246]  But regarding Dick Cheney, he very possibly could have used the service.
[02:23:02.406 --> 02:23:03.306]  I don't remember him.
[02:23:03.366 --> 02:23:04.946]  I'm sure he used an alias.
[02:23:06.647 --> 02:23:10.887]  After all, he probably would not have used the service once he became Vice President.
[02:23:10.907 --> 02:23:11.768]  That's pretty obvious.
[02:23:11.788 --> 02:23:13.548]  He became very well known.
[02:23:13.648 --> 02:23:18.609]  But in the mid to late 90s, as he stated off the radar screen and during the Clinton years,
[02:23:19.535 --> 02:23:34.858]  You know, I could have sent easily a 25, 26, 28-year-old woman, we hired age 23 and up, who would have been 18 years of age when he was the Secretary of Defense back in the late 80s and early 90s.
[02:23:35.718 --> 02:23:38.539]  And to be honest with you, she wouldn't have recognized him.
[02:23:38.719 --> 02:23:40.379]  But why is his name coming up?
[02:23:41.419 --> 02:23:44.000]  Well, you know, there are people who claim that
[02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:52.392]  I'm alive, it's true.
[02:23:52.412 --> 02:23:53.435]  Boy, this is dangerous.
[02:23:54.337 --> 02:23:55.621]  What were the circumstances of it?
[02:23:55.861 --> 02:23:58.589]  Maybe we'll question Brandy Britton's death.
[02:24:00.874 --> 02:24:21.383]  Well, you know, people say that she was a very upbeat person, a very positive person, that she was going into court, she was ready to fight him, that she absolutely was not going to give in, and all of a sudden, I think a few days before she was to go to trial, she committed suicide.
[02:24:22.003 --> 02:24:28.566]  And her family members, her friends, say that this was extremely abnormal, she was not in the frame of mind to commit suicide.
[02:24:29.353 --> 02:24:32.217]  Uh, you know that perhaps she knew something?
[02:24:32.237 --> 02:24:34.700]  There's been a lot of speculation about that.
[02:24:35.781 --> 02:24:36.742]  She had very little to lose.
[02:24:36.762 --> 02:24:37.863]  She wasn't going to go to jail.
[02:24:37.883 --> 02:24:38.204]  That's right.
[02:24:38.244 --> 02:24:40.306]  She'd been charged on a prostitution case.
[02:24:40.747 --> 02:24:43.250]  She'd been busted, but I guess she was going to name names or something.
[02:24:44.435 --> 02:24:44.916]  Who knows?
[02:24:45.256 --> 02:24:45.697]  Who knows?
[02:24:45.877 --> 02:24:47.739]  Maybe that's what they thought she was going to do.
[02:24:47.799 --> 02:24:57.428]  Maybe that's what they thought I was going to do when I suddenly closed my business in August of 2006 and was selling my house and trying to move to Europe.
[02:24:57.969 --> 02:24:59.971]  I had no intention of doing any such thing.
[02:25:00.111 --> 02:25:07.677]  I just had every intention of just moving on with my life, and they panicked and thought that I was going to do something similar to what you're doing.
[02:25:07.817 --> 02:25:08.538]  Okay, folks.
[02:25:08.598 --> 02:25:09.859]  Okay, John, thanks for editing that.
[02:25:09.899 --> 02:25:12.561]  We'll play more tomorrow on the main show, 11 to 3 p.m.
[02:25:12.601 --> 02:25:16.344]  Central, now in overdrive at the InfoWars.com streams.
[02:25:16.704 --> 02:25:21.908]  Wayne Madsen is going to be on with us to talk about this, and I'm going to talk about other big developments on this case.
[02:25:22.128 --> 02:25:24.230]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, you can watch right now.
[02:25:26.764 --> 02:25:29.046]  Again, InfoWars.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:29.106 --> 02:25:31.608]  Right now, you go there to listen to the InfoWars streams.
[02:25:31.648 --> 02:25:32.268]  More exclusives.
[02:25:34.770 --> 02:25:36.632]  Thank you for listening to G... Good job, Jones.
[02:25:36.652 --> 02:25:37.212]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[02:25:37.272 --> 02:25:37.652]  Thank you.
[02:25:37.692 --> 02:25:39.714]  We'll see you back for the main transmission tomorrow, John.
[02:25:39.734 --> 02:25:40.174]  Good job.
[02:25:40.334 --> 02:25:40.815]  Thank you, sir.
[02:25:41.075 --> 02:25:41.435]  Perfect.
[02:25:41.455 --> 02:25:42.036]  Take care.
[02:25:42.616 --> 02:25:42.916]  Alright.
[02:25:42.956 --> 02:25:46.719]  U.S.CivilFlags.org is here to... We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:46.759 --> 02:25:48.741]  Transmission continuing into overdrive.
[02:25:49.021 --> 02:25:49.902]  We do have Wayne Madsen.
[02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:52.191]  Yes, hello Alex.
[02:25:52.711 --> 02:25:58.755]  Sir, we have Miss Britton clearly being murdered, according to her family.
[02:25:58.815 --> 02:26:03.778]  Now, Debra Jean Palfrey says she would never kill herself, even if she was found guilty, that she would then name names.
[02:26:04.278 --> 02:26:06.500]  And I guess they didn't want the name being named.
[02:26:06.540 --> 02:26:09.381]  I would imagine, buddy, you are in grave danger right now.
[02:26:09.421 --> 02:26:14.685]  Wayne Madsen, worked for the National Security Agency, lives in D.C., runs WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:26:15.485 --> 02:26:16.506]  Give us your analysis, sir.
[02:26:17.287 --> 02:26:23.129]  Well, I have to say I was shocked to hear about what happened to Jean this morning.
[02:26:23.469 --> 02:26:28.810]  I saw her last in the courtroom the day the judge announced something very strange.
[02:26:28.890 --> 02:26:42.994]  The judge, James Robertson, said on a Monday morning after a weekend that after an exchange of emails between him, the defense, and the prosecutors, that he decided that they all decided they were going to end the case.
[02:26:43.946 --> 02:26:44.427]  I don't know.
[02:27:03.496 --> 02:27:04.798]  I haven't seen emails yet.
[02:27:05.398 --> 02:27:10.725]  I've never seen a case tried over the internet over a weekend.
[02:27:11.385 --> 02:27:17.553]  I think Judge Robertson owes us all an explanation because now we've seen the tragic outcome of the case.
[02:27:19.370 --> 02:27:20.391]  You talk to her quite a bit.
[02:27:20.431 --> 02:27:23.114]  I talked to her on air three times, I think four times.
[02:27:24.155 --> 02:27:25.376]  When was the last time you talked to her?
[02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:26.537]  What's your intel on this?
[02:27:26.957 --> 02:27:31.762]  Hung, let me just read this to the listeners that are out there and the viewers that are out there watching.
[02:27:32.122 --> 02:27:35.565]  DC Madam commits suicide in Tarpon Springs.
[02:27:36.206 --> 02:27:44.393]  Police say DC Madam Deborah Jean Palfrey, shame on them going along with this, hung herself at her mother's house in Tarpon Springs Mobile Home Park Thursday.
[02:27:45.014 --> 02:27:46.415]  Palfrey was dubbed the D.C.
[02:27:46.455 --> 02:27:53.218]  Madam of the national media after her arrest for alleged running an upscale call girl ring in the nation's capital.
[02:27:53.678 --> 02:27:56.980]  She was convicted on Tuesday on money laundering.
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:58.401]  First case in modern history of that.
[02:27:58.441 --> 02:27:59.161]  Now they're going after
[02:28:01.232 --> 02:28:04.953]  Elliot Spitzer, they're now claiming he liked to have women do things with sex toys to him.
[02:28:05.393 --> 02:28:12.355]  And in the CIA, New York Post, just, just, well, Meemaw Bush has so many gay porn stars visiting him, you know, it makes your head spin.
[02:28:12.395 --> 02:28:14.656]  It's just, it's just all this political assassination.
[02:28:15.116 --> 02:28:22.158]  She was convicted on Tuesday of money laundering and using mail for illegal purposes and racketeering, but she had not yet been sentenced.
[02:28:23.078 --> 02:28:25.842]  Just like the same thing happened to Ken Lay, he died of a heart attack before he could be sentenced.
[02:28:26.202 --> 02:28:32.670]  This is a tragic news and my heart goes out to her mother, Defense Attorney Preston Burton, who represented Paul Free in her criminal trial.
[02:28:33.191 --> 02:28:36.335]  I guarantee you, she talked, her cell phone, they were listening to her over that.
[02:28:36.896 --> 02:28:38.858]  She said, I'm going to go ahead and name names and boy...
[02:28:39.699 --> 02:28:47.823]  They got stuff where they can just, with a van, microwave you through a wall, come in, hang you, or say we're going to kill your whole family if you don't put your head in this noose.
[02:28:48.404 --> 02:28:53.726]  They killed a local Palestinian a few weeks ago in Austin, cut his whole body up, bound him, threw him in the river.
[02:28:54.167 --> 02:29:00.430]  I mean, Wayne Madsen, this is so obvious, this murder, what happened to Miss Britton, one of her girls.
[02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:02.291]  Give us your take on this.
[02:29:03.052 --> 02:29:09.439]  Well, I'm also getting over the fact that Houston police shot a CIA agent, Roland Carnaby, on Tuesday.
[02:29:09.539 --> 02:29:11.100]  So there's a lot of weird stuff happening.
[02:29:11.140 --> 02:29:15.505]  But, Gene Palfrey, two things wrong with the reports from the corporate media.
[02:29:16.050 --> 02:29:19.133]  She was convicted on April the 15th, not this past Tuesday.
[02:29:19.694 --> 02:29:28.623]  And there was also an indication that one ABC affiliate in Tampa said she was charged with running a house of prostitution.
[02:29:28.643 --> 02:29:29.764]  That's absolutely incorrect.
[02:29:29.784 --> 02:29:30.325]  She was not.
[02:29:30.405 --> 02:29:36.151]  I would point out that ABC 2020, they were the ones that promised the name names of her clients.
[02:29:36.491 --> 02:29:37.472]  We're good to go.
[02:29:54.091 --> 02:29:57.876]  I did meet with Gene Palfrey on several occasions, socially.
[02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:09.392]  Uh, somebody very close to Gene Palfrey was my source.
[02:30:09.732 --> 02:30:10.933]  Well, we don't want them to get killed.
[02:30:10.973 --> 02:30:11.613]  Who was the source?
[02:30:12.554 --> 02:30:14.315]  Well, I don't want to go into detail.
[02:30:14.355 --> 02:30:17.997]  Do you want to say right now you're not going to hang yourself tomorrow night?
[02:30:18.097 --> 02:30:19.558]  I'm not going to hang myself.
[02:30:19.598 --> 02:30:20.118]  Let's be clear.
[02:30:20.138 --> 02:30:21.619]  You're not going to commit suicide?
[02:30:22.019 --> 02:30:22.600]  Oh, no way.
[02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:23.100]  Say it all.
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:24.061]  Say it all right now.
[02:30:24.721 --> 02:30:26.082]  I'm not going to commit suicide.
[02:30:26.142 --> 02:30:27.743]  I'm very happy here.
[02:30:27.763 --> 02:30:28.363]  I want to see this.
[02:30:30.105 --> 02:30:35.793]  On January 20th of next year, I want to see George Bush flown preferably to The Hague and not back to the Crawford Ranch.
[02:30:35.833 --> 02:30:37.015]  So I'm going to stick around for that.
[02:30:38.117 --> 02:30:40.419]  Well, this is Dangerous Waters here.
[02:30:42.401 --> 02:30:46.225]  Look, I would tell people what you do know, because you know they're going to probably come kill you and others.
[02:30:46.665 --> 02:30:48.727]  Wayne, you know we're not joking.
[02:30:48.747 --> 02:30:52.691]  Well, I know, but they better take their best shot.
[02:30:52.711 --> 02:30:54.052]  They better not miss, because I won't.
[02:30:54.353 --> 02:30:55.554]  That's all I have to say.
[02:30:56.054 --> 02:30:59.438]  But anyway, Dick Cheney was obviously a client.
[02:31:00.138 --> 02:31:01.540]  I know for a fact, also,
[02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:12.584]  From very good sources, there were a couple of GOP candidates, one present candidate, well I pretty much said so, and some previous candidates for the GOP nomination for president were also clients.
[02:31:12.604 --> 02:31:13.444]  So John McCain?
[02:31:13.944 --> 02:31:14.744]  John McCain, yes.
[02:31:14.924 --> 02:31:16.945]  Do you think that's what this housekeeping can be about?
[02:31:16.985 --> 02:31:17.105]  Yes.
[02:31:17.465 --> 02:31:20.106]  Fred Thompson and Rudy Giuliani.
[02:31:23.367 --> 02:31:26.088]  And do you believe, Palinfrey, that she didn't know who these clients were?
[02:31:26.678 --> 02:31:28.199]  I think she knew exactly who they were.
[02:31:28.479 --> 02:31:32.700]  As a matter of fact, remember, most of her clients were in McLean, Virginia.
[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:34.361]  That was the center of activity.
[02:31:34.461 --> 02:31:39.583]  Thirteen years she had the most discreet escort service in Washington.
[02:31:39.623 --> 02:31:41.724]  She didn't send... Why didn't they leave her alone?
[02:31:41.844 --> 02:31:43.324]  Why are they killing all these women?
[02:31:43.524 --> 02:31:44.645]  They're the ones that called them!
[02:31:45.504 --> 02:31:48.005]  Exactly, and this is how they're cleaning it up.
[02:31:48.405 --> 02:31:52.327]  They used them and now they're disposing of them, and it's disgusting.
[02:31:52.787 --> 02:32:07.293]  Obviously the agency, meaning the CIA, used these girls because these were professional, well-educated, these were not barely English-speaking Koreans or people from... Oh, you think it's an intelligence op?
[02:32:07.513 --> 02:32:09.654]  You think these girls were being run by an agency?
[02:32:10.154 --> 02:32:14.557]  I absolutely do, and I feel that... I pressed Jean on that many occasions.
[02:32:14.597 --> 02:32:17.939]  She never told me, but of course she may have made an agreement never to say that.
[02:32:17.959 --> 02:32:19.240]  So, that makes sense.
[02:32:19.260 --> 02:32:24.223]  Oh, you're saying you believe she was working for a subsection of the U.S., or Israelis, or Russians?
[02:32:24.264 --> 02:32:29.067]  No, no, I believe McLean, Virginia, obviously, is where the CIA is located, I believe.
[02:32:29.547 --> 02:32:31.408]  But, I mean, so it wasn't subsections.
[02:32:31.428 --> 02:32:32.489]  Well, you know, it's infiltrated.
[02:32:33.109 --> 02:32:34.110]  So you believe the U.S.
[02:32:34.170 --> 02:32:37.392]  government was running an operation against U.S.
[02:32:37.412 --> 02:32:37.833]  targets?
[02:32:38.153 --> 02:32:39.254]  Well, she said on this show
[02:32:40.194 --> 02:32:44.416]  That they were using her as bait to track people?
[02:32:45.017 --> 02:32:49.439]  Oh, I believe that's true, and I believe they were, you know, entrapping Middle Eastern leaders.
[02:32:49.499 --> 02:32:50.880]  We know that they were clients.
[02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:59.804]  We know that Cheney was using them not only for his own predilections, but also to entertain potential customers in the Middle East for Halliburton.
[02:33:00.565 --> 02:33:08.589]  We know that Cheney... I reported today, I reiterated that some of Cheney's top lieutenants at Halliburton and KBR, Kellogg Brown and Root,
[02:33:08.909 --> 02:33:11.790]  And we know about the sexual harassment of KBR people.
[02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:14.191]  This is an awful company, and so is Halliburton.
[02:33:14.371 --> 02:33:24.334]  Well, it came out about the CIA head, Porter Goss, would go to the Watergate, where on one floor you had gambling, the next floor you had the, quote, free hookers.
[02:33:25.555 --> 02:33:28.557]  So it's just... I mean, why didn't they kill those girls?
[02:33:28.597 --> 02:33:45.372]  We don't know that they haven't, because the Sherlington Limousine that was delivering those women to the Watergate and to another hotel in Washington, the Sherlington Limousine was transporting Pamela Martin and Associates escorts, the escorts that work for Gene Palfrey.
[02:33:46.387 --> 02:33:49.989]  Do you think these women have any idea how much danger they're in?
[02:33:51.450 --> 02:33:58.733]  Women out there listening, if you're going to be engaged in prostitution, stay far away from Washington and high-powered dignitaries in New York.
[02:33:59.961 --> 02:34:00.522]  Absolutely.
[02:34:00.582 --> 02:34:03.365]  And you know, Pamela Martin also, there was this Baltimore connection.
[02:34:03.765 --> 02:34:07.509]  NBC Nightline just recently ran a story about what happened to the Assistant U.S.
[02:34:07.569 --> 02:34:09.872]  Attorney in Baltimore, Jonathan Luna.
[02:34:09.932 --> 02:34:17.339]  There is a definite connection between his death and his office was investigating the Governor of Maryland, Republican Governor of Maryland, Bob Ehrlich.
[02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:22.465]  And you mentioned Brandy Britton, the other Pamela Martin escort who hanged herself.
[02:34:22.944 --> 02:34:28.486]  How did they get the local cops to play along with this, I guess just for their paycheck?
[02:34:43.829 --> 02:34:45.330]  Ed Morris.
[02:34:45.390 --> 02:34:46.791]  He was prosecuted by the U.S.
[02:34:46.852 --> 02:34:47.152]  Attorney.
[02:34:47.412 --> 02:34:48.073]  The first U.S.
[02:34:48.133 --> 02:34:51.876]  Attorney fired after Bush's re-election was Tom DiBaggio, the U.S.
[02:34:51.916 --> 02:34:58.401]  Attorney for Maryland, because he was pursuing the case against Ehrlich and his use of the prostitute.
[02:34:58.897 --> 02:35:12.288]  Okay, so from your intel, again, Wayne Madsen, former, worked with the NSA, you know, muckrakes, corruption with the Wayne Madsen Report, great info, always over there, very scary info, very dangerous info, you have a lot of courage, sir.
[02:35:12.689 --> 02:35:17.152]  Going back here, why do you think they originally raided her when she was leaving the country?
[02:35:18.153 --> 02:35:19.835]  Do you think she was going rogue on them?
[02:35:20.455 --> 02:35:22.737]  Or who's playing who?
[02:35:23.558 --> 02:35:24.699]  What do you think developed here?
[02:35:24.759 --> 02:35:26.140]  What are you being told by your sources?
[02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:49.035]  I asked her about that, and Jean herself told me that what they were afraid of is that when she was going to move to Germany, she had an apartment in Berlin, she was going to retire from the business, close it up, go to Europe, and interestingly enough, the apartment was in East Berlin, which made me wonder, was she told about that by maybe some friend of hers in that agency I mentioned not too long ago?
[02:35:49.756 --> 02:35:56.240]  But they were deadly afraid that her black book, this is the term they used, this is what the prosecutors used,
[02:35:56.580 --> 02:36:00.926]  Her black book was going to appear on the pages of Der Spiegel or Stern magazine in Germany.
[02:36:05.251 --> 02:36:08.295]  Do you believe her when she says that she wasn't planning any of that?
[02:36:10.087 --> 02:36:12.368]  I don't think she was going to do that.
[02:36:12.408 --> 02:36:15.410]  She had millions of dollars.
[02:36:15.450 --> 02:36:19.093]  Why would she want to destroy her life and send black-op murder squads after her?
[02:36:19.453 --> 02:36:19.974]  Absolutely.
[02:36:20.014 --> 02:36:21.274]  She would have no reason to do that.
[02:36:21.315 --> 02:36:27.239]  But see, the people in the government, in the Bush administration, didn't know where she was coming from, and that's when they jumped on her.
[02:36:29.300 --> 02:36:32.422]  Now, does the evidence show they tried to kill the case?
[02:36:32.442 --> 02:36:34.304]  Because from what I've seen, they just left it alone.
[02:36:35.319 --> 02:36:37.640]  Well, they had her tied up.
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:39.381]  They seized her assets first.
[02:36:39.862 --> 02:36:43.144]  She had to go through this awful issue with civil asset forfeiture.
[02:36:43.184 --> 02:36:45.445]  She never got her assets returned.
[02:36:45.965 --> 02:36:48.006]  But the one thing they left were those phone records.
[02:36:48.026 --> 02:36:49.547]  They never seized those phone records.
[02:36:49.587 --> 02:36:55.651]  Of course, this was an operation done by the Internal Revenue Service and the Postal Inspection Service.
[02:36:56.071 --> 02:36:59.972]  They played all kinds of games, you know, these cat-and-mouse games where they were harassing her.
[02:37:00.653 --> 02:37:02.633]  But finally, you know, they brought the charge.
[02:37:02.833 --> 02:37:04.274]  I would also add that the first U.S.
[02:37:04.334 --> 02:37:13.757]  judge, Gladys Kessler, in a very surprised decision, asked the Chief Judge Tom Hogan in Washington to be relieved of the case.
[02:37:13.837 --> 02:37:15.017]  So she was the first judge.
[02:37:17.118 --> 02:37:19.701]  Gene had, and she asked to be relieved of the case.
[02:37:19.881 --> 02:37:22.303]  I wonder, was she being pressured by somebody?
[02:37:22.383 --> 02:37:23.164]  Boil it down.
[02:37:23.344 --> 02:37:24.665]  Yeah, well, she'll hang herself next.
[02:37:25.166 --> 02:37:26.607]  Then we'll all start hanging ourselves.
[02:37:26.627 --> 02:37:29.049]  I mean, I am not, folks.
[02:37:29.109 --> 02:37:29.650]  Guaranteed.
[02:37:29.730 --> 02:37:33.534]  I am not ever going to commit suicide on all these subjects.
[02:37:34.094 --> 02:37:34.815]  Then boil it down.
[02:37:34.895 --> 02:37:39.339]  From the sources, from what you've got, in a minute, I mean, how would you boil this down?
[02:37:39.439 --> 02:37:40.220]  What has happened here?
[02:37:41.007 --> 02:37:49.291]  Well, I think, you know, whether this was a tragic suicide or there was foul play involved, Jean Palfrey did not want to go to prison.
[02:37:49.331 --> 02:37:51.552]  I do know that from talking to people close to her.
[02:37:51.913 --> 02:37:57.135]  She feared that, and we know about, you know, from the Don Siegelman case, how he was mistreated in prison.
[02:37:57.195 --> 02:38:02.038]  So, obviously, the Bush administration wants this story to go away.
[02:38:02.058 --> 02:38:03.598]  I am not going to let it go away.
[02:38:08.539 --> 02:38:11.748]  I hope they don't taser you and then you wake up dead though, Wayne.
[02:38:12.791 --> 02:38:16.481]  Well, like I said, they better take their best shot because if they miss, I won't.
[02:38:17.176 --> 02:38:18.396]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:38:18.836 --> 02:38:21.737]  You walk in, they taser you, they kill you, and you never even know they killed you.
[02:38:21.757 --> 02:38:27.578]  And then the cops on their payroll, you know, just show up and... I mean, it's getting ridiculous.
[02:38:27.598 --> 02:38:30.399]  The local Palestinian guy, they cut up all over his body.
[02:38:31.139 --> 02:38:33.779]  When they fished him out of the water, the report was he was all sliced up.
[02:38:34.419 --> 02:38:39.560]  Arms, legs bound, mouth and eyes covered with duct tape.
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:43.021]  And then the news said, oh, it's quite normal, he committed suicide this way.
[02:38:43.801 --> 02:38:52.974]  I mean, it's just, I mean, they could drop me into a meat grinder on a jumbotron at the Super Bowl and have Bush pull the lever and they tell us it was suicide.
[02:38:53.482 --> 02:38:54.342]  Well, the Assistant U.S.
[02:38:54.422 --> 02:38:59.544]  Attorney in Baltimore, Jonathan Luna, they said he stabbed himself to death 33 times with a penknife.
[02:38:59.984 --> 02:39:09.788]  So, uh, this is a guy who was at the same office that was investigating the Baltimore Police Commissioner and the Republican Governor of Maryland, Bob Ehrlich, for their involvement with the D.C., uh, with the D.C.
[02:39:09.828 --> 02:39:10.868]  Madame Jean Palfrey.
[02:39:10.908 --> 02:39:13.409]  So, you go figure how an Assistant U.S.
[02:39:13.469 --> 02:39:16.490]  Attorney could stab himself to death 33 times with a penknife.
[02:39:18.571 --> 02:39:22.212]  And then, and then he found half drowned in a creek in Pennsylvania off the Turnpike.
[02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:35.537]  Meanwhile, we've got national TV anchors who have girls with their brains bashed out, found in their offices, so they're giving TV shows instead of... I mean, what is it like in D.C.?
[02:39:35.577 --> 02:39:39.900]  I mean, I've been there quite a few times, but... I mean, it's just insane asylum of... It's wretched.
[02:39:40.020 --> 02:39:40.881]  It's wretched, Alex.
[02:39:41.141 --> 02:39:44.183]  I mean, on a day like this, I wonder what the hell I'm doing here.
[02:39:44.923 --> 02:39:46.084]  But, you know, I mean, if I don't...
[02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:49.671]  You say the CIA agent got killed in Houston.
[02:39:49.691 --> 02:39:50.212]  Tell me about that.
[02:40:09.775 --> 02:40:14.941]  Yeah, Rowan Carnaby was a long-time CIA agent.
[02:40:15.321 --> 02:40:22.289]  He was the head of the local Houston chapter of the Association for Intelligence Officers, AFIO.
[02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:28.716]  He was gunned down by two Houston cops Tuesday morning at 11.30 near the gallery at less than six
[02:40:29.316 --> 02:40:29.997]  We're good to go.
[02:40:48.574 --> 02:41:02.000]  Things signed by George Tenet, Blacks for his dedication, years of service to the CIA, pictures of him standing at the CIA headquarters in Langley, and now the corporate media is suggesting that maybe he faked all this, that he was not really a CIA agent.
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.761]  They go and interview his ex-wife, who said, well, he told me a lot, it's all pale.
[02:41:06.201 --> 02:41:07.082]  I mean, can you imagine?
[02:41:07.342 --> 02:41:15.005]  The word I'm getting is from good sources in Houston that Carnaby may have been hit because it may have been a result of
[02:41:17.070 --> 02:41:29.777]  The FBI taking down this old Israeli spy who was tied up with Jonathan Pollard, Ben-Ami Kandish, just last week, and they're threatening to go after other high-level Israeli moles in the Bush administration.
[02:41:29.797 --> 02:41:32.338]  And this may have been a hit on Carnaby.
[02:41:33.039 --> 02:41:36.361]  Carnaby, I would add, was a Lebanese-American.
[02:41:36.421 --> 02:41:39.362]  His father was a very well-known Lebanese diplomat.
[02:41:39.422 --> 02:41:42.064]  Yeah, they're killing a lot of Lebanese and Palestinians.
[02:41:42.724 --> 02:41:43.485]  It seems that way.
[02:41:44.361 --> 02:41:48.902]  So, do you think Israel's tied in any way?
[02:41:49.362 --> 02:41:50.223]  Floating a bunch of names?
[02:41:50.943 --> 02:41:56.044]  I have heard that Houston is a very large Mossad station in the United States.
[02:41:56.104 --> 02:41:57.145]  Oh yeah, of course.
[02:41:57.225 --> 02:42:01.166]  And Mossad has their fingerprints all over the Carnaby killing.
[02:42:02.406 --> 02:42:04.667]  And so now they can just have their cops in plain view?
[02:42:04.687 --> 02:42:08.428]  The cops pull you over, they get out, and they walk over and gun you down?
[02:42:08.988 --> 02:42:09.548]  Apparently.
[02:42:09.888 --> 02:42:10.369]  Apparently.
[02:42:14.076 --> 02:42:16.858]  You know, I wonder if it's going to turn out that these cops are Israelis.
[02:42:17.118 --> 02:42:18.979]  It'll be case closed if that's it.
[02:42:18.999 --> 02:42:22.162]  Well, either they were influenced or paid off by them.
[02:42:22.262 --> 02:42:27.926]  We do know that the ADL has a tremendous influence in some of the larger police departments in the United States.
[02:42:28.106 --> 02:42:32.048]  Oh yeah, they've been convicted of having the police keep private dossiers for them.
[02:42:32.509 --> 02:42:33.169]  Absolutely.
[02:42:33.669 --> 02:42:37.012]  And by the way, everybody of note, not just if you don't like Israel.
[02:42:38.092 --> 02:42:38.312]  Right.
[02:42:38.493 --> 02:42:44.462]  God help us, this country is so... it's just... What are the main factions from your research running things right now?
[02:42:45.304 --> 02:42:52.075]  Well, look, we still have this Chaney faction, which has its own separate chain of command, even over nuclear weapons.
[02:42:52.968 --> 02:43:01.670]  Uh, this chain goes from Cheney's office, bypasses Gates, and in one case for the nuclear chain, it goes right into the Air Force.
[02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:12.753]  Air Force Secretary Wynn, Air Force Chief of Staff General Michael Mosley, and that incident with the nukes at Minot and Barksdale last year was run out of Cheney's office.
[02:43:12.833 --> 02:43:14.433]  What do you think that really was in Minot?
[02:43:14.974 --> 02:43:20.535]  I believe that that was tied to what happened with the Syrian facility, which happened a few days later.
[02:43:20.555 --> 02:43:30.998]  I think it was a prelude to using those six nuclear cruise missiles on some sort of either attack on Iran or some sort of false flag that was going to be blamed on Iran.
[02:43:32.338 --> 02:43:34.219]  And you think it leaked because people blew the whistle?
[02:43:34.259 --> 02:43:38.180]  At first I didn't think that was anything, but then all those people that were involved with them died.
[02:43:39.102 --> 02:43:52.412]  Yeah, I checked out some of those deaths, and unfortunately some were, as we know, the VA has covered up the fact that 30 veterans kill themselves each day, which is an amazing number when you think about it.
[02:43:52.812 --> 02:43:54.353]  Some of those deaths were... You know what it is?
[02:43:54.393 --> 02:43:56.435]  We've got these weird suicides.
[02:43:57.236 --> 02:43:58.657]  We've got these, just like Palfrey.
[02:44:00.538 --> 02:44:04.760]  We've got these crazy old men with rotten hearts, both physically and spiritually.
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:07.081]  They just want war and global government.
[02:44:07.101 --> 02:44:10.082]  Cheney, we know, is really a rough character.
[02:44:10.102 --> 02:44:14.303]  I think before he dies, he'll just decide to nuke everything or something, probably.
[02:44:14.323 --> 02:44:15.044]  I mean, there's no telling.
[02:44:15.064 --> 02:44:20.086]  These people are just psychopathic killers and nothing but psycho cops that follow any order they give them.
[02:44:20.866 --> 02:44:21.626]  We're just screwed.
[02:44:22.307 --> 02:44:22.867]  Right, right.
[02:44:22.907 --> 02:44:26.028]  I always said George Bush didn't want to be the President of the United States.
[02:44:26.068 --> 02:44:28.429]  He wanted to be the last President of the United States.
[02:44:29.915 --> 02:44:30.735]  But where do you see this?
[02:44:30.795 --> 02:44:32.136]  I mean, they own Hillary.
[02:44:32.576 --> 02:44:33.756]  Limbaugh's behind her.
[02:44:33.856 --> 02:44:34.836]  Fox is behind her.
[02:44:35.877 --> 02:44:41.118]  They've got Obama with the kind of whole Rockefeller arm through Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[02:44:41.158 --> 02:44:46.100]  You've got McCain, totally psychopathic with cancer, running around.
[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:48.760]  I mean, I've seen video of him that you don't see on the news.
[02:44:48.780 --> 02:44:49.921]  I mean, he's completely nuts.
[02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:54.062]  I mean, it's just, I guess this is Rome in decline.
[02:44:54.882 --> 02:44:55.443]  It could be.
[02:44:55.503 --> 02:45:15.361]  I mean, the only thing we could possibly see this, Davis, is there's enough time for a third-party candidate to emerge, but I'm afraid that person could be basically a power broker, like we know that Ross Perot tossed it to Clinton in 92, and I'd hate to see, you know, a third-party candidate.
[02:45:15.401 --> 02:45:20.686]  It'd be nice to see a third-party candidate win, is what I'm trying to say, rather than be a power broker.
[02:45:21.479 --> 02:45:23.381]  Well, this is definitely a reckless group.
[02:45:23.421 --> 02:45:29.025]  I think their chutzpah has gotten to them, and it's just wild-eyed craziness now.
[02:45:29.045 --> 02:45:31.887]  I mean, these guys are bored.
[02:45:31.927 --> 02:45:33.789]  I just think they love all the chaos they've created.
[02:45:33.809 --> 02:45:34.449]  What do you say to that?
[02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:36.170]  Well, I do.
[02:45:36.211 --> 02:45:39.613]  I think the neocons, what do you want to call these people?
[02:45:39.633 --> 02:45:44.417]  The Christian Dominionists, the Reconstructionists, they pray for our
[02:45:48.579 --> 02:45:50.381]  They don't belong in the White House or Congress.
[02:45:50.401 --> 02:45:52.062]  They belong in lunatic asylum.
[02:45:54.183 --> 02:45:58.105]  Meanwhile, you've got all these nihilistic people pushing the phony environmental amendment.
[02:45:59.146 --> 02:46:01.587]  Wayne Madsen, report.com, and a great source of info.
[02:46:01.627 --> 02:46:05.570]  In the few minutes we've got left with you, Wayne, getting more into Deborah Jean Palfrey.
[02:46:05.610 --> 02:46:08.271]  I mean, on my show, repeatedly saying she would never commit suicide.
[02:46:08.291 --> 02:46:09.052]  We played that earlier.
[02:46:09.252 --> 02:46:12.173]  We'll play more of it tomorrow, 11 to 3 central on the main show.
[02:46:12.414 --> 02:46:13.534]  This is overdrive right now.
[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:17.882]  Wayne, you talked to her, you met with her.
[02:46:19.564 --> 02:46:23.989]  Did she say anything like, if they convict me, I'm going public, or I'm going to release names?
[02:46:24.009 --> 02:46:27.212]  Any details you can give us.
[02:46:27.252 --> 02:46:29.275]  What were your other sources in D.C.
[02:46:29.295 --> 02:46:33.039]  saying that this is McCain, this is Cheney, this is all these people?
[02:46:33.737 --> 02:46:43.813]  Well, there were other sources coming forward that really sympathized with her, with Jean Palfrey, and said, look, you might not hear this from her, but here's some additional names now.
[02:46:44.814 --> 02:46:48.961]  I know that she had inklings, if she didn't have
[02:46:49.341 --> 02:46:52.963]  Full knowledge, she had inklings about who some of these clients were.
[02:46:53.784 --> 02:47:02.048]  But she was trying to, in one respect, I think she was afraid of what could happen if she came totally clean.
[02:47:02.068 --> 02:47:06.250]  Now, she did release these phone records, and she eventually released them to the public.
[02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:07.851]  We did get a couple of names.
[02:47:07.891 --> 02:47:10.753]  We got Vitter, we got Tobias.
[02:47:10.813 --> 02:47:13.354]  These are years old, the numbers change, and of course, offices.
[02:47:13.394 --> 02:47:16.476]  Yeah, and a lot of them were hotels, and they were very fancy hotels.
[02:47:17.136 --> 02:47:17.978]  But they're dead ends.
[02:47:18.098 --> 02:47:18.839]  And I looked at that.
[02:47:19.059 --> 02:47:19.981]  I went through that list.
[02:47:20.261 --> 02:47:23.467]  Well, she kept saying, look, I'll just go away.
[02:47:23.567 --> 02:47:24.549]  Leave me alone.
[02:47:25.070 --> 02:47:26.031]  I'll drop this.
[02:47:26.171 --> 02:47:27.273]  Why are you doing this to me?
[02:47:27.938 --> 02:47:42.181]  Yeah, I think they just wanted her, you know, they wanted her on... You know, after she was convicted, the prosecutor actually put his hand up like he had won just, you know, his favorite team just won a football game.
[02:47:42.221 --> 02:47:44.862]  I mean, just that kind of thing just bothered me.
[02:47:45.162 --> 02:47:46.562]  You get this from a U.S.
[02:47:46.622 --> 02:47:47.082]  attorney.
[02:47:48.122 --> 02:47:50.323]  You know, he went, yeah, yeah, we got her, you know, like...
[02:47:51.043 --> 02:47:54.265]  And then they wanted her to go directly to jail, like they did to Don Siegelman.
[02:47:54.305 --> 02:48:00.890]  So they obviously didn't want her between the conviction and the time of sentencing to have any... Well, let me expand on that.
[02:48:00.930 --> 02:48:17.580]  We now have the White House executive order, the memos, ordering the torture, and then they would send their own people who'd carried out the torture to prison and grandstand against it, and then one of them tried to defend himself with memos, and they declared a Patriot Act, said he was a terrorist, and wouldn't let him defend himself.
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:19.802]  I mean, it's so incredible
[02:48:20.342 --> 02:48:24.666]  That they hire the prostitutes and then they kill them and I guess they're psycho killers.
[02:48:24.746 --> 02:48:26.488]  I mean they just do whatever they want.
[02:48:26.808 --> 02:48:27.089]  They just...
[02:48:29.042 --> 02:48:31.143]  I mean, these are sick people.
[02:48:31.183 --> 02:48:37.284]  We had the former prosecutor in Guantanamo now showing up as a witness for the defense.
[02:48:37.404 --> 02:48:45.606]  I mean, this reminds me of the French Revolution where the executioners eventually became those who executed themselves.
[02:48:45.726 --> 02:48:50.087]  You know, I always thought elites wanted stability and soft power.
[02:48:50.107 --> 02:48:51.867]  I guess the old ones did and they were bad enough.
[02:48:52.507 --> 02:48:54.848]  This is really a crew of complete maniacs.
[02:48:55.716 --> 02:49:09.407]  I believe they are, and I look at this bunch in the White House, you look at these movies about the boys in a bunker in Berlin in April of 45, I think there's a lot of similarities.
[02:49:11.509 --> 02:49:18.715]  I wonder, I guess the special ops guys that have been doing this for 30 years, I guess they just like drugging a woman or tasing her and then hanging her.
[02:49:19.902 --> 02:49:28.907]  Yeah, I mean, you know, you gotta wonder what goes through a cop's mind when he, you know, we see these reports about tasering old ladies and guys in wheelchairs.
[02:49:28.967 --> 02:49:30.628]  I mean, what kind of sick people are they?
[02:49:33.049 --> 02:49:44.535]  Yeah, we know going back into the 60s they had hit teams in LA run by the police chief and by the CIA and I guess now that's just, they just rule and they got, that's it and shut up, we're the mafia and that's the end of it.
[02:49:45.525 --> 02:49:46.065]  Absolutely.
[02:49:46.386 --> 02:50:02.834]  You know, getting back to Jean Palfrey, the one thing that really bugs me here is her very elderly mother, Blanche, living in this manufactured home north of Tampa in Tarpon Springs, not only had to deal with this tragic death, but had to deal with a Fox News helicopter hovering over her home.
[02:50:02.954 --> 02:50:06.556]  Can you imagine what she went through this morning?
[02:50:07.737 --> 02:50:11.399]  Again, they continue the torture even after Jean's death.
[02:50:16.348 --> 02:50:19.810]  I would also add that they harassed her mother, the agent harassed her mother.
[02:50:20.190 --> 02:50:23.992]  Came around to visit her one night at 8 o'clock in the evening and really scared her.
[02:50:25.633 --> 02:50:26.474]  You know what ladies in their 80s.
[02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:28.731]  Well, they're good at this.
[02:50:28.811 --> 02:50:31.153]  Reading the details, it really stinks to high heaven.
[02:50:32.293 --> 02:50:34.695]  I mean, what does the public think about this?
[02:50:34.735 --> 02:50:44.463]  I mean, if they're torturing and chopping up Palestinians and duct-taping them in the river and then saying it's suicide, I guess in a way this is a message to us that can think.
[02:50:44.503 --> 02:50:46.424]  It's like, hey, we kill whoever we want.
[02:50:47.505 --> 02:50:48.546]  Well, that's right.
[02:50:48.586 --> 02:50:49.046]  That's right.
[02:50:49.126 --> 02:50:54.631]  And, you know, as I said, we may have a turf war here with what happened to Carnaby.
[02:50:55.293 --> 02:50:56.793]  CIA agent in Houston.
[02:50:57.113 --> 02:51:03.455]  We may have a turf war as a result of us getting tough with this old Mossad guy and going after potentially some others.
[02:51:04.495 --> 02:51:08.136]  The way you deal with them is the way you deal with anybody that does that kind of thing.
[02:51:08.476 --> 02:51:13.637]  You start delivering some Mossad agents to the Israeli embassy in Washington in boxes and in pieces.
[02:51:13.697 --> 02:51:16.838]  Maybe they'll get the message then to stop their nonsense over here.
[02:51:17.138 --> 02:51:19.378]  Maybe they'll set a nuke off and run around grandstanding.
[02:51:19.418 --> 02:51:20.079]  How much do they have?
[02:51:20.559 --> 02:51:21.619]  They might do that anyway.
[02:51:22.588 --> 02:51:25.009]  Well, they have had people in the Knesset say they may nuke Europe.
[02:51:26.109 --> 02:51:27.309]  Well, that's always nice to hear.
[02:51:27.949 --> 02:51:34.171]  Investigators say Palomfrey's 70-year-old mother, Blanche, noticed a three-wheel bicycle had been moved from a shed next to her home.
[02:51:34.591 --> 02:51:36.931]  When she went to the shed to investigate, I mean, that's perfect.
[02:51:36.951 --> 02:51:40.092]  She gets out of her car, they tase her, they take her out, they hang her.
[02:51:40.212 --> 02:51:45.573]  Oh, that's, oh man, that she didn't hang herself in the house, which psychologically, you do it in a comfortable place.
[02:51:46.014 --> 02:51:47.354]  I mean, that is total murder.
[02:51:47.394 --> 02:51:48.114]  This is, oh my God.
[02:51:48.994 --> 02:51:53.275]  That's when she found her daughter hanging from the ceiling by a nylon rope in the shed.
[02:51:53.575 --> 02:51:55.656]  She called 911, but Palfrey was already dead.
[02:51:56.296 --> 02:51:58.097]  There were handwritten notes at the scene.
[02:51:58.497 --> 02:51:59.277]  Oh, yes.
[02:51:59.297 --> 02:51:59.977]  There always are.
[02:52:01.257 --> 02:52:03.398]  Indicating that Palfrey intended to take her own life.
[02:52:03.418 --> 02:52:05.379]  A lot of times, they'll just taser you.
[02:52:05.399 --> 02:52:06.259]  You wake up tied down.
[02:52:06.279 --> 02:52:10.040]  They go, listen, your mama's in there, and I'm going to go in there, and I'm going to rape her, and then I'm going to kill her.
[02:52:10.100 --> 02:52:14.041]  But it's going to take a few weeks unless you go ahead and you write this like I say right now.
[02:52:15.137 --> 02:52:17.998]  Well, yeah, I've seen it many times before, these types of reports.
[02:52:38.177 --> 02:52:47.941]  You know, Ted Westhusing, the Army colonel who was investigating fraud amongst contractors in Baghdad, he supposedly shot himself.
[02:52:49.121 --> 02:52:57.824]  You know, we've got all these incidents and none of them really passed any smell tests, and I've written about a lot of them.
[02:52:58.565 --> 02:53:04.487]  And I think the hallmark of the Bush administration is, under George Bush and Big
[02:53:05.247 --> 02:53:10.189]  The United States became Argentina during the dirty wars where people were disappeared.
[02:53:12.530 --> 02:53:14.590]  Wayne Madsen, Report.com.
[02:53:14.650 --> 02:53:16.051]  I want to get you back up on the show tomorrow.
[02:53:16.071 --> 02:53:16.911]  I have a producer call.
[02:53:16.931 --> 02:53:20.652]  You've got to stay here for 20-30 minutes as you have more time to collate and talk to people.
[02:53:20.672 --> 02:53:22.373]  But anything else your sources told you?
[02:53:22.673 --> 02:53:26.014]  Anything else Debra Jean Palfrey, clearly murdered, told you?
[02:53:26.054 --> 02:53:27.455]  Anything else that we should look for?
[02:53:28.095 --> 02:53:33.997]  I mean, they killed Britain, they killed her, I mean, do you think they're going to kill more people if they do find you dead?
[02:53:34.037 --> 02:53:34.937]  Or five gunshots?
[02:53:35.597 --> 02:53:36.998]  I know you laugh, but I mean, it'd kill me too.
[02:53:37.318 --> 02:53:38.658]  I mean, you're really in trouble, buddy.
[02:53:38.698 --> 02:53:43.480]  I mean, if they kill you, I mean, do you want to just make it very clear you're not going to kill yourself?
[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:45.000]  Absolutely.
[02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:49.401]  And furthermore, in Washington, we had a state of people jumping off of buildings here.
[02:53:50.201 --> 02:53:54.983]  John Kuckel, State Department Iraqi analyst, and Gus Weiss, a retired CIA
[02:53:56.175 --> 02:54:00.057]  Officer, I'll make a play right now that I'm very afraid of heights.
[02:54:01.198 --> 02:54:02.378]  So that won't be the way.
[02:54:02.999 --> 02:54:04.500]  No, I'm not.
[02:54:04.580 --> 02:54:07.381]  If anyone hears about it, that's absolutely not the case.
[02:54:07.721 --> 02:54:19.908]  I will say that I had sources in addition to Jean, but they verified everything that she was trying to say about the high-level nature of these clients of her escort service.
[02:54:20.468 --> 02:54:23.230]  And in one case, I found out that
[02:54:24.231 --> 02:54:30.803]  Dick Cheney did get a job for one of the escorts at the political job at the Agriculture Department.
[02:54:31.243 --> 02:54:33.808]  So Cheney's fingerprints are all over this case.
[02:54:34.850 --> 02:54:37.314]  And I guess that's a little jelly he really liked.
[02:54:38.597 --> 02:54:39.898]  Yeah, well he must have.
[02:54:40.459 --> 02:54:52.209]  And if this isn't a suicide, if it eventually goes from suicide to homicide, I would suggest to the police investigators the first person they need to go interview is Mr. Cheney.
[02:54:52.750 --> 02:54:53.991]  Oh yeah, I'm sure they'll interview him.
[02:54:54.291 --> 02:54:55.672]  He just killed a million Iraqis.
[02:54:56.853 --> 02:54:57.773]  That's the thing, folks.
[02:54:57.993 --> 02:54:59.614]  You laugh at Iraqis and say they're not human.
[02:54:59.854 --> 02:55:00.934]  They're doing this to us here.
[02:55:01.654 --> 02:55:09.056]  And it's just so painful to see this happen, to have talked to her, to have seen this happen, and to have them kill her in the shed.
[02:55:10.116 --> 02:55:11.797]  This is just so classic.
[02:55:13.197 --> 02:55:15.898]  It doesn't matter if you say, I'm not going to kill myself, I'm not going to.
[02:55:17.168 --> 02:55:26.012]  I mean, I remember some of the Arkansas that were so ridiculous, in and around all the CIA drug dealing there, and it's just, it has to end someday, it has to stop.
[02:55:26.652 --> 02:55:28.593]  Do you think these crazies are still going to attack Iran?
[02:55:28.613 --> 02:55:30.514]  More and more people say they're not going to now, Wayne.
[02:55:31.174 --> 02:55:36.616]  I'll tell you, there's a window, and it's between now and when the monsoon rains start.
[02:55:37.556 --> 02:55:46.000]  If they wait until after the monsoon rains start, and the way the prevailing winds are in that part of Asia, they come down out of
[02:55:46.460 --> 02:55:46.880]  I think so.
[02:56:07.397 --> 02:56:08.638]  But it's a new ball game.
[02:56:08.658 --> 02:56:16.687]  They'll just probably do whatever, they'll probably fly around with prostitutes on nooses hanging from helicopters, dressed up in devil outfits.
[02:56:16.768 --> 02:56:18.530]  I mean, who knows these people now?
[02:56:19.210 --> 02:56:20.272]  They'll just say it's of the Lord.
[02:56:25.222 --> 02:56:36.274]  Right, a rice crop that's already in... We have a food crisis now, but if Asia's rice crop is irradiated as a result of radioactive rainfall, I think China will hit the U.S.
[02:56:36.334 --> 02:56:37.015]  7th fleet.
[02:56:37.315 --> 02:56:46.865]  Then I think that every war game that Colonel Sam Gardner ran when he was with the National War College and Naval War College will come to pass.
[02:56:47.626 --> 02:56:49.107]  What really happened?
[02:56:49.747 --> 02:56:50.828]  Tell us what will come to pass.
[02:56:50.928 --> 02:56:51.748]  This is important.
[02:56:53.109 --> 02:56:54.890]  He said it was a bad idea to hit Iran.
[02:56:55.130 --> 02:56:56.871]  Is that why they drove Fallon out?
[02:56:57.632 --> 02:57:03.555]  Oh yeah, that's why they drove Fallon out and an accused Vice Admiral John Stufflebeam, who had just
[02:57:04.148 --> 02:57:05.729]  Uh, left as commander of the 6th fleet.
[02:57:05.769 --> 02:57:07.049]  He was chief of the naval staff.
[02:57:07.069 --> 02:57:12.871]  They accused him of having an affair 18 years ago, when he was an aide to then-president George H.W.
[02:57:12.911 --> 02:57:13.211]  Bush.
[02:57:13.591 --> 02:57:16.292]  He was the guy that carried the football, the nuclear code.
[02:57:16.592 --> 02:57:21.353]  And they brought up an 18-year-old case, and they fired him and took one of his stars away.
[02:57:21.573 --> 02:57:24.414]  Because he and Fallon were... Yeah, go ahead.
[02:57:24.994 --> 02:57:27.655]  Yeah, he and Fallon both were opposed to any hit on Iran.
[02:57:28.235 --> 02:57:30.496]  Now they got Petraeus in there in charge of CENTCOM.
[02:57:31.414 --> 02:57:32.714]  What type of person is Petraeus?
[02:57:32.754 --> 02:57:35.375]  He looks like the boyfriend of George Bush type.
[02:57:35.935 --> 02:57:41.337]  Yeah, yeah, well, a lot of our troops in Iraq call him General Betraeus, not Petraeus.
[02:57:43.117 --> 02:57:45.578]  So, I guess Betraeus will do whatever he's told.
[02:57:45.598 --> 02:57:46.979]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:57:47.039 --> 02:57:58.102]  He's a lick spittle, and as my friend George Galloway, the British MP, says, he has a great term, he's a poppin' J, because he'll do anything, as you say, anything he's told.
[02:57:58.900 --> 02:58:05.885]  And what do the war game shows going to happen if they cause World War III in the foremost strike there?
[02:58:05.925 --> 02:58:07.907]  Retaliation from China against the U.S.
[02:58:07.947 --> 02:58:08.668]  7th Fleet.
[02:58:09.368 --> 02:58:10.869]  Retaliation by Russia.
[02:58:10.889 --> 02:58:13.912]  We're talking global thermonuclear warfare.
[02:58:14.932 --> 02:58:16.954]  Which is, I guess, what psychopaths want, son.
[02:58:17.374 --> 02:58:18.415]  Which is the end of it all.
[02:58:20.016 --> 02:58:22.058]  But other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how'd you like the play?
[02:58:23.928 --> 02:58:31.750]  And meanwhile, you have put out the information that sources told you that it was Dick Cheney, and you're living in D.C.
[02:58:31.770 --> 02:58:34.110]  where they have the largest concentration of their hitmen.
[02:58:34.990 --> 02:58:37.151]  And again, you are not going to commit suicide.
[02:58:37.191 --> 02:58:37.791]  You're happy.
[02:58:38.051 --> 02:58:39.011]  You're not depressed.
[02:58:39.051 --> 02:58:40.012]  You're doing well.
[02:58:40.752 --> 02:58:41.572]  I am.
[02:58:42.192 --> 02:58:44.132]  You're doing a great job, Wayne Madsen.
[02:58:44.152 --> 02:58:45.273]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:58:45.653 --> 02:58:50.014]  Folks definitely need to support you, and we appreciate you coming on the air.
[02:58:50.034 --> 02:58:50.974]  Anything else you need to add?
[02:58:51.815 --> 02:58:53.116]  No, just my condolences.
[02:58:53.196 --> 02:58:57.942]  I go out to Jeanne's mom, Blanche Palfrey.
[02:58:57.982 --> 02:59:01.005]  She must be having just a terrible time of it down there.
[02:59:03.168 --> 02:59:10.997]  Like I say, with a Fox News helicopter flying overhead and she has to deal with the tragic death of her 52-year-old daughter.
[02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:27.708]  Well, they say it was a garage parking shed for cars and stuff, and I'm sure she got out of her car, they zapped her, hung her, and it won't even matter what the coroner says if they do say, just like CIA guys publicly shoot Robert Kennedy,
[02:59:28.488 --> 02:59:33.074]  And then it comes out later, the film footage of all the three CIA guys there, and they killed him.
[02:59:33.114 --> 02:59:35.236]  And just like the coroner said, it just won't matter.
[02:59:35.257 --> 02:59:36.118]  They'll just say, shut up.
[02:59:36.598 --> 02:59:38.540]  I bet if you talked to neighbors, I bet it was sloppy.
[02:59:38.560 --> 02:59:40.543]  I bet they saw somebody go in the shed.
[02:59:40.803 --> 02:59:42.625]  But if they say anything, they'll just commit suicide.
[02:59:45.288 --> 02:59:47.311]  Well, you can imagine the people who live in that area.
[02:59:47.351 --> 02:59:51.855]  These are elderly, retired folks, not on big incomes.
[02:59:52.216 --> 02:59:59.384]  I think Gene's mother was living off of Social Security, so obviously these people are going to be easily intimidated, the neighbors.
[03:00:00.347 --> 03:00:11.052]  Well, I really appreciate you talking with us, Wayne, and I'm going to have my producer call you, like I said, to get you to pop in at the start of the show tomorrow at 12 noon Eastern, and for 10 or 15 minutes if you can, just so we can... Okay.
[03:00:11.833 --> 03:00:12.433]  Thank you.
[03:00:12.853 --> 03:00:13.994]  Okay, good to be with you, Alex.
[03:00:14.074 --> 03:00:14.894]  Thank you, Wayne Madsen.
[03:00:14.914 --> 03:00:16.095]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[03:00:16.135 --> 03:00:19.216]  Now we're 34 minutes into Overdrive here today.
[03:00:19.236 --> 03:00:21.918]  I'm going to spend just a few more minutes and then end this transmission.
[03:00:24.108 --> 03:00:28.650]  If you're listening today and you're thinking, wow, this is Overdrive, you won't hear the Overdrive re-aired.
[03:00:28.670 --> 03:00:32.392]  We air the four hours of the show back-to-back until we're live again at 11 a.m.
[03:00:33.012 --> 03:00:38.694]  And if you're listening to like the Genesis stream some days and you're wondering what's going on behind the scenes, you can always listen during the regular show.
[03:00:39.054 --> 03:00:45.097]  During the breaks, we do shows, you know, continue the show during the breaks at TheInfoWars.com streams.
[03:00:45.417 --> 03:00:46.718]  So those are the streams you want to listen to.
[03:00:50.242 --> 03:00:53.445]  I want to read you an IM from Paul Watson.
[03:00:53.485 --> 03:00:59.009]  In fact, we'll just put this up on screen for people so they can see that.
[03:01:01.311 --> 03:01:04.733]  And then I'm going to read a little passage from A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.
[03:01:04.793 --> 03:01:06.275]  It's actually a news article she wrote.
[03:01:06.655 --> 03:01:08.276]  It's in the back in the appendix.
[03:01:09.117 --> 03:01:11.659]  But there is my IM there.
[03:01:12.700 --> 03:01:18.924]  Paul Watson said, Today is May Day, Beltane Day, Sex and Blood Sacrifice.
[03:01:20.094 --> 03:01:20.454]  I knew it!
[03:01:20.494 --> 03:01:27.219]  There would be a blood sacrifice leading to another violent event in this FEMA War Games from Seattle to the East Coast is it?
[03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:31.282]  Debra, they're doing one in Austin, a martial law takeover drill right here in Austin right now.
[03:01:32.783 --> 03:01:34.024]  We just sent Carews out there.
[03:01:34.525 --> 03:01:37.847]  Debra Palvery is the blood sacrifice, the sex and the blood sacrifice.
[03:01:38.167 --> 03:01:40.069]  This is also the birthday of the Illuminati.
[03:01:40.549 --> 03:01:41.510]  Comment from the reader.
[03:01:43.211 --> 03:01:44.832]  Yeah, Paul's right, the reader's right.
[03:01:44.852 --> 03:01:45.153]  1776, May 1st.
[03:01:47.870 --> 03:01:48.551]  This is admitted.
[03:01:48.591 --> 03:01:50.253]  This is in your encyclopedia, not our opinion.
[03:01:51.175 --> 03:01:52.376]  A lot of stuff you don't know about, folks.
[03:01:52.436 --> 03:01:52.937]  It's real.
[03:01:53.838 --> 03:01:56.142]  This is when they do the most human sacrifices.
[03:01:57.443 --> 03:02:00.728]  The other high holiday is Samhain in English.
[03:02:03.994 --> 03:02:08.019]  And this is when the second largest amount of child kidnappings happened then.
[03:02:08.059 --> 03:02:12.104]  And there's newspaper articles, scores of them, where they find babies with their hearts chopped out.
[03:02:12.144 --> 03:02:17.089]  But it's always kept quiet because, you know, well that's satanic, that scares the public, and plus that doesn't exist.
[03:02:17.129 --> 03:02:19.772]  So they just close the babies up and that's the end of it.
[03:02:19.793 --> 03:02:22.456]  And they've been tortured all over their body first for hours.
[03:02:23.837 --> 03:02:33.062]  They start with smaller and smaller jabs with ice picks, and they suck blood out, the baby screams and cries, they believe it's terror gives them power, and then they finally rip its guts out and cut the poor thing's heart out.
[03:02:34.102 --> 03:02:37.104]  But in the last week, you'll notice you saw a lot of kidnapping news.
[03:02:37.544 --> 03:02:44.488]  See, that's the kids they kidnapped for today, and they'll be murdering them all night long.
[03:02:44.568 --> 03:02:50.171]  Your cops are involved, your judges, your CPS workers, your politicians, they'll be murdering children all day today.
[03:02:51.055 --> 03:02:51.556]  Nice people!
[03:02:52.036 --> 03:02:52.978]  Hand your guns in!
[03:02:53.298 --> 03:02:54.740]  All you liberals say, why are you a gun nut?
[03:02:54.760 --> 03:02:55.501]  I'm not a gun nut.
[03:02:55.782 --> 03:03:01.790]  I realize when they get our guns, they're going to have a red style terror hair, with their red pennant, and have their way with us.
[03:03:02.231 --> 03:03:03.313]  I'm just not going along with it.
[03:03:06.693 --> 03:03:07.914]  Beltane is their holy day.
[03:03:07.954 --> 03:03:09.736]  It's also the International Communist Day.
[03:03:09.756 --> 03:03:14.620]  When you go to google.com, they've got the symbol up there for May 1st.
[03:03:15.080 --> 03:03:17.102]  The politicians are celebrating it.
[03:03:17.482 --> 03:03:18.983]  It's a big Earth Gaia Day.
[03:03:19.003 --> 03:03:21.025]  A lot of useful idiots are part of it.
[03:03:21.946 --> 03:03:25.669]  But this is the highest holy day for them.
[03:03:27.290 --> 03:03:29.813]  But I'm sure it's all just a coincidence.
[03:03:31.289 --> 03:03:39.072]  Just a coincidence today on May 1st, 1776, the modern birth of the Illuminati, because it had groups before it.
[03:03:39.732 --> 03:03:42.474]  Okay, I think now I will say something positive.
[03:03:42.494 --> 03:03:44.754]  I haven't read this.
[03:03:44.794 --> 03:03:53.238]  It's one of my wife's books, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, but I have a tendency to read about a book before I decide if I want to read it.
[03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:57.671]  So I was reading about the author the other day, and just scanning, as you know.
[03:03:58.812 --> 03:04:01.233]  My wife reads a book about every two days.
[03:04:02.414 --> 03:04:05.475]  I wouldn't say she's an insomniac, but she sleeps about five hours a night.
[03:04:05.515 --> 03:04:06.736]  She just reads until late every night.
[03:04:06.756 --> 03:04:08.397]  I don't know why I'm getting off into that.
[03:04:08.417 --> 03:04:11.038]  The point is that there's books all over the house, and I don't read many of her books.
[03:04:13.619 --> 03:04:15.020]  Well, I'm reading The Last of the Mohegans again.
[03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:15.660]  That's good.
[03:04:18.507 --> 03:04:20.488]  I kind of call it reality-based fiction.
[03:04:21.068 --> 03:04:29.673]  But, Tree Girls in Brooklyn, I was just reading about this lady, Betty Smith, growing up in Brooklyn, and about how it was really about her life, just put into a novel form.
[03:04:29.733 --> 03:04:33.394]  And she was a newspaper writer for the New York Times and other publications.
[03:04:34.515 --> 03:04:46.401]  And I was reading just a short little blurb she did for this week's news magazine, this week's magazine, Fall in Love with Life, a piece by Betty Smith.
[03:04:48.729 --> 03:04:50.830]  There's that for you right there.
[03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:53.511]  And this is really my philosophy.
[03:04:53.551 --> 03:04:55.812]  This is my philosophy.
[03:04:56.452 --> 03:05:01.134]  This is why I don't want them to kill me next week or next month, though I know I'm really upsetting them right now.
[03:05:02.995 --> 03:05:04.956]  But it's why I'm just committed and don't care.
[03:05:05.576 --> 03:05:14.180]  Because I want to try to live, I'll defend myself if they try to kill me, but I'm going to do what I'm going to do, just like Wayne Madsen was just saying.
[03:05:15.543 --> 03:05:17.144]  Again, they'll kill a million Iraqis, folks.
[03:05:17.164 --> 03:05:18.044]  They just shoot kids.
[03:05:18.064 --> 03:05:24.687]  They sit off the side of the road in front of newspaper reporters, and there'll be a woman walking with her three-year-old, and they'll just blow her head off with a .50 cal from a half mile away and laugh.
[03:05:25.648 --> 03:05:32.831]  Or they'll have families driving, getting in their cars, and the troops just shoot them and watch them fall down dead and laugh, and, you know, they shoot dogs and throw puppies off cliffs.
[03:05:32.851 --> 03:05:39.554]  They're all coming back to be cops, and why don't they be recruited in, and they'll end up being your killer when they're taking your property and everything you got?
[03:05:41.415 --> 03:05:43.056]  And I'm sorry, but that's
[03:05:44.298 --> 03:05:49.201]  Who we're dealing with, that's who we're facing, and that's what happens when we become an evil society and we stop caring.
[03:05:49.681 --> 03:05:55.024]  You can't just go through life like it's a carnival and only care about yourself and not know about politics or not fight corruption.
[03:05:55.524 --> 03:05:58.726]  When you do that, it grows and breathes like a cancer and then takes over.
[03:05:59.046 --> 03:06:02.989]  And then there's giant death camps and guillotines and people running around in black uniforms.
[03:06:03.049 --> 03:06:04.009]  I mean, in burning cities.
[03:06:04.069 --> 03:06:05.030]  It's what they do!
[03:06:05.550 --> 03:06:06.451]  They screw stuff up!
[03:06:07.051 --> 03:06:10.173]  They want power, normal people don't, so they always take over.
[03:06:10.613 --> 03:06:12.334]  Until we have to fight back to survive.
[03:06:13.663 --> 03:06:14.744]  And we've now reached that point.
[03:06:16.385 --> 03:06:18.766]  So I'm going to go ahead and read this and then wrap up this transmission.
[03:06:19.887 --> 03:06:21.528]  I'd love to continue, but I've got a lot of work I've got to do.
[03:06:21.968 --> 03:06:22.829]  See, I love my work.
[03:06:22.909 --> 03:06:24.049]  I love fighting in the World War.
[03:06:25.450 --> 03:06:28.732]  Not like a lot of these other talk show hosts that think this is a game or a grandstanding.
[03:06:29.053 --> 03:06:30.013]  This is real, folks.
[03:06:30.033 --> 03:06:30.714]  This isn't a game.
[03:06:31.074 --> 03:06:32.154]  This takes full commitment.
[03:06:32.955 --> 03:06:34.196]  Fall in love with life.
[03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:37.031]  A piece by Betty Smith.
[03:06:37.051 --> 03:06:41.855]  You know, most people would kill to be able to go to Patriot meetings and strut around and be admired and looked at.
[03:06:42.536 --> 03:06:44.737]  You'll never see me at these little shindigs and functions.
[03:06:45.678 --> 03:06:48.200]  And that's because, again, I'm just trying to get people's heads screwed on straight out there.
[03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:49.361]  This is life and death.
[03:06:49.381 --> 03:06:50.342]  This is warfare.
[03:06:50.582 --> 03:06:51.783]  This is everything on the line.
[03:06:52.123 --> 03:06:53.945]  I mean, they are putting cancer in your vaccines.
[03:06:53.985 --> 03:06:54.986]  They are injecting you.
[03:06:55.006 --> 03:06:55.926]  They are spraying you.
[03:06:56.167 --> 03:06:57.348]  They're murdering you.
[03:06:57.368 --> 03:06:58.068]  Do you understand?
[03:06:58.088 --> 03:07:00.330]  You understand that out there?
[03:07:00.350 --> 03:07:02.492]  I mean, let that hit you.
[03:07:03.459 --> 03:07:04.360]  Let that get to you.
[03:07:04.420 --> 03:07:07.342]  Let that burn in out there and soak in real good.
[03:07:10.345 --> 03:07:10.985]  This is real.
[03:07:12.786 --> 03:07:15.989]  When they tasered her and then hung her, that was real, folks.
[03:07:16.890 --> 03:07:18.691]  And the cops, when they cover it up, that's real.
[03:07:20.913 --> 03:07:25.777]  When they tortured this Palestinian here in Austin to death and threw him in the river and called it a suicide, that's real.
[03:07:30.538 --> 03:07:31.518]  The New World Order is real.
[03:07:31.538 --> 03:07:32.398]  They're coming for you.
[03:07:32.618 --> 03:07:33.459]  What are you going to do about it?
[03:07:34.999 --> 03:07:36.219]  Those of you that serve, it's evil.
[03:07:36.259 --> 03:07:37.420]  You're being attacked by them.
[03:07:39.160 --> 03:07:39.700]  You like that?
[03:07:41.120 --> 03:07:43.981]  Fall in love with life, a piece by Betty Smith.
[03:07:46.822 --> 03:07:59.785]  As a listening child, I often heard older people say, oh, the plans I'd made, and what dreams I had, and the inevitable, if only I had my life to live over.
[03:08:00.911 --> 03:08:04.394]  I reason that these men and women had missed the fullness of life somehow.
[03:08:05.355 --> 03:08:06.597]  But I wasn't going to miss it.
[03:08:06.757 --> 03:08:15.686]  I decided at the age of 14, I planned, in a slightly used copy of a book, I made a full list of what I wanted for my life.
[03:08:16.747 --> 03:08:19.189]  I vowed to attain those things one by one.
[03:08:19.749 --> 03:08:20.810]  The plan never worked out.
[03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:23.712]  Most of my adult life I had to work to support myself and others.
[03:08:24.653 --> 03:08:29.337]  A lot of the fullness of life was expended in the competitive business world.
[03:08:29.857 --> 03:08:31.098]  But I was young and optimistic.
[03:08:31.859 --> 03:08:34.000]  This is only for the time being, I said.
[03:08:34.341 --> 03:08:36.983]  Someday it will all come out the way I want it to.
[03:08:39.431 --> 03:08:43.032]  But the years went by, and then I was middle-aged and alone.
[03:08:43.492 --> 03:08:46.653]  My children had left to make their own full life somewhere.
[03:08:47.493 --> 03:08:51.994]  I, too, began to think, if only I had my life to live over again.
[03:08:52.335 --> 03:08:54.755]  You know, men think like this, too, but especially women.
[03:08:54.775 --> 03:08:57.896]  I really learned how women tick, and this is the main female drive.
[03:08:59.136 --> 03:09:01.277]  If only I had had my life to live over again.
[03:09:02.978 --> 03:09:07.399]  One rainy night, I went down to the drugstore to get a paperback to read myself to sleep on.
[03:09:08.709 --> 03:09:15.734]  I picked up a Emily Zola book and stood there holding it, wanting to remember something I had read long ago.
[03:09:16.915 --> 03:09:30.904]  When it came to me, Zola had said, in what I'd read long ago, to have a child, to plant a tree, to write a book, that, he said, was a full life.
[03:09:32.746 --> 03:09:35.928]  A great stillness grew about me as I realized
[03:09:38.467 --> 03:09:41.989]  I'd had a child, I'd planted a tree, in fact, I'd even written a book.
[03:09:42.730 --> 03:09:48.253]  Though when Zola said book, I'm sure he meant it is a symbol for any constructive job honestly done.
[03:09:49.194 --> 03:09:52.816]  And so, according to the tenets of a great man, I had had a full life.
[03:09:53.377 --> 03:09:57.680]  My children had given me a quiet, never-ending ecstasy.
[03:09:58.340 --> 03:09:59.781]  Oh, I know exactly what that means.
[03:10:00.361 --> 03:10:05.585]  My children had given me a quiet, never-ending ecstasy all the years of their growing up.
[03:10:08.038 --> 03:10:17.345]  A little thrown-away sapling I'd planted 25 years ago is now a tree above my house, and I've enjoyed its shade.
[03:10:17.385 --> 03:10:23.330]  My children, and later their children, played under it, and, God willing, there will be great-grandchildren playing under it, too.
[03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:30.075]  And I was even able to make a book out of all my hopes and fears and dreams.
[03:10:32.242 --> 03:10:37.965]  No one of these things had been set down in the notebook because they were part of me.
[03:10:38.706 --> 03:10:39.806]  Things I took for granted.
[03:10:41.447 --> 03:10:47.150]  For instance, when I was first aware that I would be a woman, I knew I'd have children.
[03:10:48.191 --> 03:10:57.976]  When I wept childishly tears as they cut down the only tree, our tenement yard, I knew I would plant a tree everywhere I lived.
[03:10:59.079 --> 03:11:05.660]  And when at the age of eight, I got my first A on a school composition, I knew I would write a book someday.
[03:11:07.221 --> 03:11:10.841]  I came to a clear conclusion, and it is a universal one.
[03:11:11.301 --> 03:11:20.243]  To live, to struggle, to be in love with life, in love with all life holds, joyful or sorrowful, is fulfillment.
[03:11:21.243 --> 03:11:24.264]  The fullness of life is open to all of us.
[03:11:25.711 --> 03:11:27.633]  Fall in love with life, a piece by Betty Smith.
[03:11:27.973 --> 03:11:28.413]  And that's it.
[03:11:28.473 --> 03:11:32.537]  Madison Avenue seeks to steal that understanding from you.
[03:11:33.638 --> 03:11:39.683]  You are fulfilled by being honorable, by being strong, by struggling, by helping others, and by having courage.
[03:11:40.244 --> 03:11:52.315]  You are unfulfilled when you're cowardly and don't commit to life, and when you always feel inadequate and feel pathetic because you don't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, or you don't look like Angelina Jolie, or because you don't live in a mansion.
[03:11:53.243 --> 03:11:57.667]  Not that those things are bad enough themselves, but if that's your penultimate goal, you've got a major problem.
[03:11:58.428 --> 03:11:59.669]  That's it for this transmission.
[03:12:00.069 --> 03:12:03.813]  We will go back to the regular transmission, an amazing four-hour regular show.
[03:12:04.333 --> 03:12:11.900]  We've done four hours and forty-six minutes today from retransmission today at InfoWars.com on the streams.
[03:12:12.200 --> 03:12:16.164]  And I'll see you back on the AM and FM dial, Global Shortwave Satellite tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:12:16.624 --> 03:12:17.065]  to 3 p.m.
[03:12:17.185 --> 03:12:19.347]  Big guest tomorrow, huge broadcast on Friday.
[03:12:19.807 --> 03:12:20.568]  Pray for us all.
[03:12:20.608 --> 03:12:21.569]  Get my books and videos.
[03:12:21.589 --> 03:12:22.429]  Get them out to everybody.
[03:12:22.750 --> 03:12:25.712]  Because I want my work and the truth I put forward to have an effect.
[03:12:26.172 --> 03:12:27.494]  I want to beat the New World Order.
[03:12:27.854 --> 03:12:29.916]  And I know that only you are holding that back.
[03:12:30.276 --> 03:12:31.257]  You decide to commit.
[03:12:31.397 --> 03:12:32.478]  You decide to take action.
[03:12:32.778 --> 03:12:34.239]  You set your mind and soul to it.
[03:12:34.499 --> 03:12:35.340]  They will fall.
[03:12:35.901 --> 03:12:36.941]  Will evil be defeated forever?
[03:12:37.022 --> 03:12:37.262]  No.
[03:12:37.742 --> 03:12:42.106]  But this great evil will be brought down and then we can start back over and defend liberty.
[03:12:42.426 --> 03:12:43.187]  God bless you all.
