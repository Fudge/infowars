[00:00:02.284 --> 00:00:04.285]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:17.291]  I want everyone that is listening to us to understand that we need to now have a moment of silence for the internet that is, as we speak, being dismantled, being killed.
[00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:25.996]  The next thirty minutes I am going to cover exactly what is happening to the internet, what is developing, what is unfolding.
[00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:34.340]  I'm going to put up on the screen for you a live image of a top story today on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.881]  That is the 11th day of June 2008.
[00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:47.386]  Up on screen in a moment, you will see the article, Secret Plan to Kill the Internet by 2012 Leaked, with a question mark.
[00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:55.410]  Some question and report that pay-per-view system to be introduced is a hoax, but wider march to regulate the web is documented.
[00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:08.194]  I want to show you another article out of iPower, where Bell Canada and Tell US, formerly owned by Verizon, are admitting that they are planning to go to this system.
[00:01:08.214 --> 00:01:12.860]  I want to go ahead and show you that article on screen now.
[00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:27.355]  Now, if you go to the story, Secret Plan to Kill the Internet by 2012, leaked, up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now, you will notice that as you scroll through the article,
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.001]  There are more than 40 links.
[00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:37.986]  Now these are links to Internet2's own corporate meetings, their own conferences, going back as early as the year 2000.
[00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:40.948]  These are congressional reports.
[00:01:41.088 --> 00:01:48.273]  These are press releases put out by Comcast, put out by Verizon, put out by many others.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.264]  You will also see a video on the screen.
[00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:56.347]  There are hundreds of versions of this all over the web.
[00:01:56.367 --> 00:02:01.172]  Some with 600,000 views, some with 800,000 views, some with 300,000 views.
[00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:09.001]  There are millions and millions of views of the video that you see on your screen of your PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, of your radio listener.
[00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:11.804]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.com and watch the video.
[00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:25.733]  When we get back from break first, after this quick break, I want to play a few minutes of this as they talk about rumor, they talk about inside sources, and this video and others have taken the web by storm.
[00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:31.617]  I want to first go through the poor blind public just beginning to grasp that this is really happening.
[00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:38.562]  And then I want to walk through, not the rumor, and I'm not criticizing this group, I commend them, but not the rumor, but the facts.
[00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:40.324]  We have the facts.
[00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:48.348]  Two and a half years ago, Paul Watson wrote a story called, MySpace is a Trojan Horse for Internet 2.
[00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:51.609]  That story was quoted heavily in several U.S.
[00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.710]  newspapers, including the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:02:55.391 --> 00:03:00.613]  And I commend the Chronicle, their IT writer actually went and looked up our facts and was stunned that we were right.
[00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:17.132]  You can Google stories because Internet2, the private consortium hooked in with the UN and ICANN, always announces, they met in Austin a few years ago, they met in London, they met in Chicago, they met in New York, they met in Tokyo, they always announce at the beginning of the conference, quote, the Internet is dead.
[00:03:17.972 --> 00:03:34.073]  And to simplify it, there's a bunch of different things we're going to do to shut the old web down over the next few years and force you on to a regulated, controlled, paid, not just paid subscription, but also taxed internet where they control where you can go.
[00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:35.955]  Not just through ending net neutrality.
[00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:55.034]  But through a lot of other systems that they're going to be using, including physically shutting down the backbone of the web, shutting down the old switchers and routers and corridors for what you know of as the web today, also allowing the old system to deteriorate
[00:03:55.675 --> 00:04:02.324]  Before it is finally switched off, they say they're going to call that a collapse or shutdown, but they're orchestrating this.
[00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:05.067]  This is like putting toll roads on an existing road.
[00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:06.690]  It's just on the internet.
[00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.475]  We'll be right back and give you the absolute facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:10.795 --> 00:04:11.336]  Stay with us.
[00:04:15.473 --> 00:04:17.575]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:22.698]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.360]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:29.704]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:32.766]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:36.148]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[00:04:36.248 --> 00:04:41.112]  Food riots and red lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:45.254]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[00:04:45.374 --> 00:04:50.216]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.
[00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:51.956]  We have tons of food in stock now.
[00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:53.637]  Call 1-800-753-1981.
[00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:56.458]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[00:04:57.118 --> 00:04:59.379]  Or go to BeforeIt'sTooLate.us.
[00:04:59.459 --> 00:05:01.580]  That's BeforeIt'sTooLate.us.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.521]  Where you'll find what you need to keep you and your loved ones secure.
[00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:08.383]  And remember, those without food will be servants of those with the food.
[00:05:08.663 --> 00:05:09.083]  Call now.
[00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:25.517]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:05:25.938 --> 00:05:32.704]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:36.587]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:06.186]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:06:06.547 --> 00:06:11.891]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:18.575]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[00:06:18.676 --> 00:06:30.144]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:31.385]  Here's the story.
[00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:39.556]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:40.918]  And here's the best part.
[00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:42.319]  It's 100% legal.
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.768]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:53.531]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:58.094]  Best of all, you could be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[00:06:58.254 --> 00:06:59.074]  It's that simple.
[00:06:59.374 --> 00:07:02.696]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[00:07:03.016 --> 00:07:06.018]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:11.982]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[00:07:12.963 --> 00:07:18.386]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:33.335 --> 00:07:34.836]  Alright, I'm going to put it back up on the screen.
[00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:36.437]  The article at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:38.158]  It's also over at Infowars.com.
[00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:40.480]  Secret plan to kill the internet by 2012.
[00:07:41.701 --> 00:07:49.686]  Let me first play the video, one of the videos responsible for a resurgence of people being concerned about this.
[00:07:49.726 --> 00:07:51.027]  Now, I'm glad they're doing this.
[00:07:51.809 --> 00:08:08.141]  But it's also very frustrating to me to know without a doubt, to have the stated facts by the telecoms, by the United Nations, by ICANN, based here in the U.S., that they are going to do this, by the universities, by hundreds of corporations.
[00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:09.402]  This has been the stated plan.
[00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:13.245]  I learned about the full extent of this in about 2001.
[00:08:13.285 --> 00:08:15.767]  I had seen rumors of it before that.
[00:08:16.127 --> 00:08:18.028]  But in one article that Paul Watson did,
[00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:21.069]  It goes through all of it.
[00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.410]  Every single bit of it.
[00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:30.331]  I mean, this whole thing is hyperlinks to mainstream news, giving you a piece here, a piece there.
[00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:39.093]  But if you go to Internet2 itself, and you go to their website, and to the other industry groups that are pushing all this, you can find out the exact facts.
[00:08:39.353 --> 00:08:42.774]  So let me just play here on screen for you a few minutes
[00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:48.718]  Uh, of, of this piece, and then we'll analyze the rumor versus the facts.
[00:08:48.738 --> 00:08:51.600]  Because they're saying, oh, industry people are telling us about a rumor.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.622]  Meanwhile, there's hundreds of mainstream articles admitting, quote, the rumor.
[00:08:55.282 --> 00:09:06.750]  It's kind of like, I talk about FEMA camps, people still say it's a rumor when it's been in the Houston Chronicle, Chicago Papers, it's been in the San Francisco Chronicle, that they've built these FEMA camps run by Halliburton and all this.
[00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.612]  It's kind of like, I hear everybody on air saying, why are oil prices so high?
[00:09:10.912 --> 00:09:11.993]  Is it the oil companies?
[00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:12.874]  Is it speculators?
[00:09:13.714 --> 00:09:13.754]  No.
[00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:16.256]  The vast majority of it is dollar devaluation.
[00:09:16.517 --> 00:09:17.778]  That's in congressional reports.
[00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:19.199]  That's what OPEC is saying.
[00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:20.640]  It is so simple.
[00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:23.002]  I'm not even that smart.
[00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:24.243]  That's what's frustrating here.
[00:09:24.323 --> 00:09:29.407]  So I have to see these people getting millions of views pushing rumors.
[00:09:30.447 --> 00:09:32.449]  It's worse than what they're saying on this piece.
[00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:33.590]  So here it is.
[00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.751]  I'll go ahead and roll this.
[00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:42.292]  And it's coming up right now.
[00:09:42.312 --> 00:09:45.674]  You'll be able to watch it if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:09:47.835 --> 00:09:48.275]  Here you go.
[00:09:48.295 --> 00:09:53.518]  Well, that's funny.
[00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:55.059]  Murphy's Law is it's not playing.
[00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:57.240]  I tell you, it just never ends, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.182]  It absolutely never ends trying to warn people.
[00:10:00.422 --> 00:10:00.943]  Oh, God.
[00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:04.485]  God Almighty.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.701]  Now that is bizarre.
[00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:09.282]  Can you guys come in here and... There we go.
[00:10:09.302 --> 00:10:10.123]  I'm going to start over.
[00:10:10.163 --> 00:10:12.604]  I want to edit that out of the video because I want to post this on the web.
[00:10:12.864 --> 00:10:17.747]  I'm asking listeners watching this now at PrisonPlanet.tv who edit my pieces and put them on the web to cut out that mistake.
[00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:24.451]  We need this to be cogent and focused for everybody out there that is patiently out there watching.
[00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:26.352]  Okay, so I'm going to go ahead.
[00:10:26.653 --> 00:10:29.755]  Now I'm going to go ahead and play the clip of these folks that really mean well.
[00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:30.695]  They're doing a great job.
[00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:35.298]  They've got a little bit of the facts, but they have no idea how serious this
[00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:36.519]  Indeed really is.
[00:10:36.659 --> 00:10:37.119]  Here it is.
[00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:50.130]  Hi guys.
[00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.213]  This is a new iPowerClip and today we have some news about the neutrality.
[00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.555]  And my name is Tanja and this is the crew.
[00:10:56.595 --> 00:11:01.759]  This is Dean, Rhys, Ian, and Chiran.
[00:11:02.992 --> 00:11:04.873]  I guess Reece will be starting today?
[00:11:05.754 --> 00:11:07.275]  I'll give you guys a little recap.
[00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:23.646]  For the people who don't know the news yet, what's happening is information has leaked out about all significant internet providers all over the globe, how they are planning to actually drastically limit and commercialize internet access by the year 2012.
[00:11:24.987 --> 00:11:34.729]  This means that by then, you will actually only be able to access a small bunch of commercial websites for which you'll have to pay a certain standard fee.
[00:11:35.089 --> 00:11:43.311]  And if you want to visit any other website that's not in your sort of like television-like package, you will have to pay something extra.
[00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:46.791]  You will have to pay extra subscriptions for every other site you visit.
[00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:50.452]  Now, this isn't just about the Internet getting expensive.
[00:11:51.272 --> 00:12:04.637]  This is about the internet just disappearing because all those other sites won't get any visitors anymore because you have to ask yourself who will visit any sort of smaller website that they have to pay a subscription for.
[00:12:04.657 --> 00:12:09.559]  Their visitor counts will go down drastically and it will all just disappear over time.
[00:12:09.599 --> 00:12:10.819]  This will happen pretty quickly.
[00:12:10.979 --> 00:12:20.323]  We actually have a contributor to Time Magazine who's doing an article about our information because we got it from inside sources who didn't want to reveal themselves.
[00:12:20.643 --> 00:12:28.407]  But this guy who contributes to Time Magazine actually has now official sources from major internet providers like Bell Canada.
[00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:36.991]  I'm going to stop right there for just a moment and then we're going to go back to this in just a second.
[00:12:37.975 --> 00:12:41.179]  Again, I don't care about getting the credit for warning everybody because I didn't.
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:48.627]  The establishment itself said it was going to do all this, but this is only one small part of it two and a half years ago.
[00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:50.469]  Six years ago.
[00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:51.869]  Eight years ago.
[00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.031]  I learned of it again six, six and a half years ago.
[00:12:54.451 --> 00:13:03.296]  So even this quote inside stuff, and now time's going to tell us what's going on, what you're hearing here that people are debating and can't believe is at one-tenth of the plan.
[00:13:03.676 --> 00:13:10.861]  So I'm going to finish up with playing part of this live to continue to comment on it, and then I'll come back and get into what's really going on for you.
[00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:17.007]  And TELUS, formerly owned by Verizon, who officially confirmed all of our story.
[00:13:17.548 --> 00:13:24.676]  But the only thing that they didn't confirm was the date, 2012, because they thought it may actually happen sooner in Canada.
[00:13:24.916 --> 00:13:26.458]  So that's even more unsettling.
[00:13:26.658 --> 00:13:38.204]  Just in case you're wondering who we are and why we are giving you this information, the thing is we are internet activists and we've been very active on the net neutrality front for years now.
[00:13:38.604 --> 00:13:43.887]  So that's why we've built up a lot of relations with the industry and with the media.
[00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:49.550]  The article will soon be published, probably in Time Magazine, with all the confirmations from official sources.
[00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:55.013]  So for those people who are in doubt and stuff, just definitely check that out.
[00:13:55.493 --> 00:14:07.064]  And yeah, what's really important, what we're going to focus our time on is actually organizing the people, organizing, bringing people together so we can actively do something about this, because that's what it's about.
[00:14:07.104 --> 00:14:11.248]  I mean, the reason we're making this clip is not to announce Doomsday or whatever.
[00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:14.131]  We have hope, and that's why we're making this clip.
[00:14:14.151 --> 00:14:15.753]  That's what motivates us to make this clip.
[00:14:16.053 --> 00:14:21.174]  Well, actually, the first thing you need to do is you need to find out exactly what's going on and how wide-reaching this is.
[00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:43.100]  That is the first thing that you need to do, and you need to do it immediately.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.021]  Okay?
[00:14:44.301 --> 00:14:50.744]  Now, let me, for everybody out there now, slowly walk through exactly what's happening here.
[00:14:52.554 --> 00:14:54.295]  The internet was set up by DARPA.
[00:14:54.975 --> 00:14:56.395]  It was built by the Pentagon.
[00:14:56.975 --> 00:15:00.196]  And they've had it going back into the 70s, even before that.
[00:15:00.216 --> 00:15:09.219]  I mean, we've got emails from the 70s and 80s where White House staff were communicating with different federal agencies over, quote, email or electronic mail.
[00:15:11.167 --> 00:15:19.211]  When Al Gore said that he had some vote in the Senate in the early 90s, before he became Vice President, to create the Internet, that is just absolutely asinine.
[00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:24.554]  The Internet, you can go read this in mainline encyclopedias, did not begin in the 90s.
[00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:27.135]  It began in the early 1960s.
[00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:36.159]  That's when it was conceived, and it was in use between secret government agencies, the scientific agencies, back in the late 60s.
[00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:37.300]  It was widely adopted.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.063]  In the 70s and was in almost all major government institutions by the early 1980s.
[00:15:43.403 --> 00:15:44.783]  So, let's get that straight.
[00:15:44.803 --> 00:15:45.804]  The government built it.
[00:15:45.924 --> 00:16:06.434]  But then, with the BBS systems and message boards and other people tying in and people paying for internet connections and using their phone lines and people putting up their own server farms and other industries and systems developing, but the government still, with the telecoms and the universities, controlled the major hubs or the routing systems.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.620]  The quote, peer-to-peer.
[00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:13.602]  And when I first learned about Internet2 back in 2001, it was from them.
[00:16:14.762 --> 00:16:26.806]  That's just one of the big multinational organizations where big companies, telecoms and others, and governments and universities, institutions, put money in and then Internet2 lobbies and regulates and tries to shape the future of it.
[00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:40.817]  And what they said they were going to do in 2001 was have 50 global corporations and 50 global international universities will house the new hubs and the new backbone of Internet 2, which they were already building then.
[00:16:41.437 --> 00:16:42.537]  It is now in place.
[00:16:42.617 --> 00:16:46.159]  They've laid the cable worldwide, they've got the satellites, all of it.
[00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:51.154]  And when you get on InternetTube, you're going to have to sign agreements.
[00:16:51.194 --> 00:16:53.836]  It's like you're going to have a sub-domain like MySpace.
[00:16:54.717 --> 00:17:04.105]  And you will go, generally pay to have a membership there, then you'll have a place, like you have a YouTube account, or you have a MySpace account, or you have a Flickr, or a Facebook account.
[00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:12.692]  But then you sign an agreement where they can regulate you, they can censor you, they can expunge your account whenever they want, they track who you are.
[00:17:13.012 --> 00:17:16.355]  You're going to have to have an ID of who you are to be on that system.
[00:17:16.815 --> 00:17:22.522]  And they argue, well, it's a corporate-slash-private-slash-government system, and so you don't have to have an Internet.
[00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:24.183]  You don't have to be on Internet, too.
[00:17:24.564 --> 00:17:26.926]  You just have to agree if you want to be on our backbone.
[00:17:26.946 --> 00:17:31.411]  That's why we say MySpace is the model of the Trojan horse for Internet, too.
[00:17:31.472 --> 00:17:32.393]  That's in their own words.
[00:17:33.806 --> 00:17:55.680]  Now they say, in all of these different documents, and in all these different reports, that they are the corporations, the government, the universities, that they are then going to force you off Internet One, which is the existing backbones, that they were going to stop by 2003, which they've now done, upgrading hubs, fixing switchers,
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.062]  Uh... that they were going to force you on the internet too.
[00:17:59.422 --> 00:18:15.192]  They were going to take over the existing pieces of router and existing systems and existing backbone that private corporate and governmental interest own or control in government's case and they're going to shut those off and put them into internet too and now whole areas of the web will be down.
[00:18:15.492 --> 00:18:32.737]  Remember in 2004 and 2005, Cogent and Level 3, two big backbone, peer-to-peer providers, not even the biggest but in the top 20, they had a fight with each other for two weeks, and they had several fights, and that a third or more of the web was just down.
[00:18:34.335 --> 00:18:46.059]  I mean, 30-40% in some cases of the websites I try to visit weren't physically down, but from where I was at, I couldn't get routed to it, because they had shut that down.
[00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:48.820]  So they're not just going to tax the web and tax email.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.040]  They're not just going to force you onto Internet 2.
[00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:53.481]  They are going to shut down the old web.
[00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:55.282]  You're saying, fine, I just won't be on Internet 2.
[00:18:55.962 --> 00:18:58.506]  Well no, it's like putting a toll road on an existing road.
[00:18:58.866 --> 00:18:59.487]  Do you understand?
[00:18:59.547 --> 00:19:02.171]  So we're going to break all this down after this quick break.
[00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:06.477]  This is the full story and we'll give you the time frame from their own documents.
[00:19:06.758 --> 00:19:07.298]  Stay with us.
[00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:14.420]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.142]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:19:18.322 --> 00:19:20.203]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:19:20.623 --> 00:19:23.504]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:19:23.824 --> 00:19:29.287]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:19:29.547 --> 00:19:33.469]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:21:12.623 --> 00:21:18.829]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:27.077]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:27.417 --> 00:21:33.003]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:21:33.323 --> 00:21:35.284]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:21:35.584 --> 00:21:40.325]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:45.387]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:49.748]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

[00:23:07.412 --> 00:23:08.493]  Let me just state the facts here.
[00:23:24.451 --> 00:23:29.612]  The multinational corporations have now lost over 60% of their newspaper circulation.
[00:23:30.253 --> 00:23:32.173]  TV cable networks are falling apart.
[00:23:32.193 --> 00:23:40.315]  The choices, the free speech, the variety, the diversity of the internet being free and open is destroying them.
[00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:42.596]  They have to do what they're doing now.
[00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:47.798]  Okay, so they want to tax the web, they want to regulate it, they want to make you thumb scan.
[00:23:47.818 --> 00:23:50.480]  You notice a lot of the new keyboards have a thumb printer on them.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:54.441]  They say by law they want to make it a crime if you don't thumb print when you get online.
[00:23:54.862 --> 00:24:03.266]  And ID, they are going to force you onto internet too by not updating the hubs and the grids on what is internet one.
[00:24:03.766 --> 00:24:14.571]  And they're going to take those grids and start cannibalizing that into Internet 2 that's already been built all over the western world, into South Korea, into China, into Japan, into Russia.
[00:24:15.091 --> 00:24:15.411]  Okay?
[00:24:15.671 --> 00:24:17.672]  You can go online and see maps of Internet 2.
[00:24:18.292 --> 00:24:20.413]  It just gets bigger and bigger by the day.
[00:24:20.453 --> 00:24:22.094]  And they use taxpayer money to do this.
[00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:25.175]  They then give the infrastructure to these companies.
[00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:31.758]  And we pay for all of this with our ISP money and with our taxes, both the private and the corporate interest.
[00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:34.719]  And there's a lot of other ways that they're doing that.
[00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:42.006]  But in case there's any denials, 40 gigabytes or $55 per month Time Warner bandwidth caps arrive.
[00:24:42.626 --> 00:24:45.809]  And of course they've already tested this in the last year and a half with Comcast.
[00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.492]  This is where you pay for your bandwidth connection.
[00:24:50.069 --> 00:24:56.154]  You pay for your T1 or you pay for your DSL or your cable modem or whatever system you're using.
[00:24:56.374 --> 00:24:57.315]  You're paying for the bandwidth.
[00:24:57.615 --> 00:25:00.577]  Then whoever you're streaming from has to pay for the bandwidth themselves.
[00:25:01.378 --> 00:25:09.565]  I go, I have two CDNs and seven other servers on top of two content distribution networks, 4infoWars and PrisonPlanet.tv, so I'm paying
[00:25:10.305 --> 00:25:20.290]  So that you can access it and see the text and watch the videos and hear the audio and our millions of people that listen on our podcast, the millions that listen on the internet, on the radio and on the AM and FM.
[00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.852]  We're paying for the satellites to deliver that to the stations.
[00:25:23.372 --> 00:25:24.693]  So understand, we pay.
[00:25:25.413 --> 00:25:27.415]  The people that run websites pay for the bandwidth.
[00:25:28.315 --> 00:25:29.296]  We pay for it all.
[00:25:29.336 --> 00:25:31.258]  Then you pay for the connection to get to us.
[00:25:31.798 --> 00:25:32.999]  The telecoms are saying no.
[00:25:33.439 --> 00:25:41.306]  We're also going to charge you when you come to InfoWars.com and you pull off of my servers and you're paying for the connection to get to my servers.
[00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:43.247]  They're being paid and exorbitantly.
[00:25:43.447 --> 00:25:45.149]  We're the only profit centers left in the country.
[00:25:46.328 --> 00:25:49.151]  And then I'm paying to give you the data.
[00:25:49.711 --> 00:25:53.254]  They say, no, you're not just going to pay for your connection.
[00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:57.839]  Alex isn't just going to pay for the servers that he provides to you to come to his websites.
[00:25:58.459 --> 00:26:11.952]  Now we're going to charge you for the amount that we meter that you are pulling down off of his site and streaming to your computer, or to your iPhone, or to your MP3 player, or whatever device you're getting media from.
[00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.566]  This is all mainstream news.
[00:26:14.966 --> 00:26:16.027]  This is news out of China.
[00:26:16.067 --> 00:26:17.869]  40 gigabytes for $55 a month.
[00:26:17.889 --> 00:26:19.490]  The Time Warner bandwidth cap arrives.
[00:26:19.991 --> 00:26:21.352]  But I don't even need to read this article.
[00:26:21.472 --> 00:26:22.413]  I live in Texas.
[00:26:22.473 --> 00:26:31.321]  It says Time Warner will launch a trial program in Texas which imposes monthly internet consumption caps on subscribers in Beaumont, Texas following a two-month grace period.
[00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:36.065]  Cable users will pay a dollar extra each for additional gigabyte consumed beyond the cap.
[00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:37.805]  See?
[00:26:38.786 --> 00:26:41.227]  And this is just one sector of their control system.
[00:26:41.507 --> 00:26:44.168]  Not just governmental taxes and email stamps.
[00:26:44.268 --> 00:26:45.329]  You buy a group stamp.
[00:26:46.129 --> 00:26:46.549]  No, no, no.
[00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.010]  Now they're adding all of this.
[00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.793]  And they're hijacking the major corridors and the hubs.
[00:26:53.393 --> 00:26:56.274]  That's known as, only one facet of that is net neutrality.
[00:26:56.594 --> 00:27:05.579]  Where instead of just not upgrading the hubs and making them go to internet too, they will just refuse to communicate with each other, peer-to-peer, and start blocking off and breaking up the web.
[00:27:05.879 --> 00:27:07.419]  Again, killing the web.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.320]  That is what's happening right now.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.421]  I've got another article here out of iPower.
[00:27:12.821 --> 00:27:15.522]  ISPs confirmed 2012, the year the Internet ends.
[00:27:16.062 --> 00:27:19.483]  But, you heard them reporting, it's already really ending.
[00:27:19.503 --> 00:27:24.664]  They're already, Comcast is already controlling how much bandwidth you can get, where you can go, what you can do.
[00:27:24.684 --> 00:27:31.486]  I remember two years ago, big ISPs started announcing, AOL controlled systems started announcing, and others, that
[00:27:32.046 --> 00:27:37.372]  They would let you go to sites that they had agreements with, big sites, big establishment sites.
[00:27:37.392 --> 00:27:44.520]  They would let you have free access, but they would give you Tier 2 for millions of other alternative websites that weren't part of their agreements.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:52.609]  They've also been writing and selling for a decade or more software you put on your computer or you download, put it on by disk or download.
[00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:58.717]  Where, quote, they restrict hateful sites, or gambling sites, or hacking sites, or porn sites.
[00:27:58.937 --> 00:28:03.763]  And then that has a database that blocks hundreds of thousands of keywords and different combinations.
[00:28:04.024 --> 00:28:05.546]  So that's another form of censorship.
[00:28:05.566 --> 00:28:07.468]  See, it's a huge cocktail.
[00:28:08.524 --> 00:28:10.305]  Hundreds of different systems they're using.
[00:28:10.585 --> 00:28:13.166]  ISPs confirmed 2012, the year the internet ends.
[00:28:13.226 --> 00:28:28.771]  Bell Canada and Tell US with Verizon employees officially confirmed the 2012 ISP all over the globe will reduce internet access and a TV-like subscription model only offering access to a small standard amount of commercial sites, a few hundred.
[00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:31.352]  You understand this is not a rumor.
[00:28:31.672 --> 00:28:32.692]  This is not a joke.
[00:28:32.992 --> 00:28:34.012]  This is not a game.
[00:28:34.353 --> 00:28:36.033]  This is happening now.
[00:28:36.353 --> 00:28:37.494]  You've got to tell everybody.
[00:28:37.534 --> 00:28:39.294]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:28:39.654 --> 00:28:47.817]  Internet2 said in 2001 they are going to take the internet as you know it away and rape the hell out of you financially.
[00:28:48.297 --> 00:28:55.539]  We'll be right back with another guest on a different subject, and later before the show ends, Jason Burmiss is going to be in here with me in studio as we analyze this further.
[00:28:55.719 --> 00:29:03.121]  To all the InfoWars activists, take the last 30 minutes, edit it all down to key info, get it out on the web, make sure everybody sees it, so they get the full picture.
[00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:04.281]  We're on the march.
[00:29:04.761 --> 00:29:06.361]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:07.282 --> 00:29:10.042]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:13.623 --> 00:29:15.003]  It is a big idea.
[00:29:15.023 --> 00:29:17.104]  A new world order.
[00:29:17.845 --> 00:29:22.089]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.533]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:29:25.573 --> 00:29:27.835]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:29:28.356 --> 00:29:30.818]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:29:31.539 --> 00:29:38.886]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:46.843]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:29:47.324 --> 00:29:50.766]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:29:51.186 --> 00:29:53.688]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:29:53.768 --> 00:29:54.909]  Most people have no idea.
[00:29:54.929 --> 00:29:55.689]  They're not after money.
[00:29:55.709 --> 00:29:56.790]  They have all the money they need.
[00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.731]  They're after power.
[00:29:57.971 --> 00:29:58.971]  That's what they're after.

[00:30:10.639 --> 00:30:11.700]  You have been warned.
[00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:15.283]  Listener, ask yourself, can I be deceived?
[00:30:15.583 --> 00:30:17.405]  Matthew 24 states four times.
[00:30:17.665 --> 00:30:19.767]  In the last days, many will be deceived.
[00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:23.269]  There are many ideas about the mark of the beast and the antichrist.
[00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.973]  What do you know about the beast, its mark, and the antichrist?
[00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:30.916]  Is the beast a superpower nation or a giant computer in Belgium?
[00:30:31.256 --> 00:30:33.438]  Is its mark an implanted chip, a tattoo,
[00:30:33.758 --> 00:30:39.120]  The National ID Card, or 666, is the Antichrist a person, title, or both?
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.121]  Some believe these things are in the future.
[00:30:41.421 --> 00:30:42.882]  Others believe that it's in the past.
[00:30:43.402 --> 00:30:46.403]  1 John states, The Antichrist is already in the world.
[00:30:46.683 --> 00:30:48.544]  What is the truth, and what is a lie?
[00:30:48.844 --> 00:30:50.865]  Are you willing to search God's Word for the truth?
[00:30:51.185 --> 00:30:52.966]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible.

[00:31:33.738 --> 00:31:34.038]  That's 888-211-1715.
[00:31:44.795 --> 00:31:48.299]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[00:31:48.619 --> 00:31:52.343]  Vaccines included, medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[00:31:52.743 --> 00:31:59.150]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually, with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:02.454]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.
[00:32:02.834 --> 00:32:11.999]  OxySilver, developed by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy, is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.322]  Taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural immunity without drug toxin.
[00:33:47.822 --> 00:33:54.524]  All right, we're just going to take the state senator's time for about five, six minutes because she's very busy and I want to get back on the internet too and what's happening there.
[00:33:55.245 --> 00:33:59.807]  Her actions, thank God, got it in the Arizona Republic, the big statewide paper out of Phoenix.
[00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:05.270]  Lawmaker asked McCain to talk with 9-11 theorist.
[00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:21.737]  This state professor there at a university is in day 17 of his hunger strike, calling for McCain to meet with him for a couple hours and talk about 9-11 being an inside job with Professor Steven Jones of physics and of course, head of architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, Richard Gage.
[00:34:22.297 --> 00:34:26.098]  And she's out there with him right now on the street in front of McCain's office.
[00:34:26.138 --> 00:34:27.459]  I'm told she went in there earlier.
[00:34:28.439 --> 00:34:30.360]  Senator Karen Johnson, thank you for coming on with us.
[00:34:31.355 --> 00:34:32.536]  Oh, you bet, Alex.
[00:34:32.616 --> 00:34:33.396]  It's my pleasure.
[00:34:33.456 --> 00:34:37.738]  I'm standing here right behind Blair, who is truly one of my heroes.
[00:34:39.118 --> 00:34:41.339]  Tell us, basically, what's happening.
[00:34:42.899 --> 00:34:47.521]  Well, Senator McCain has received all the information.
[00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:50.342]  He's got the DVD of Richard Gage.
[00:34:50.482 --> 00:34:53.564]  He's got information from Blair.
[00:34:54.504 --> 00:34:56.585]  And that has been given to him.
[00:34:56.605 --> 00:34:59.706]  The staff here at McCain's office here in Phoenix
[00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:13.200]  Has validated that McCain now has all this information and the request to be able to have Blair speak with him even if it's only an hour.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:22.526]  I mean Blair is certainly willing to take that if that's what he could get and have Stephen Jones and Richard Gage come and speak with McCain.
[00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:28.310]  They've had that now for a couple of days and Blair has not received an answer yet.
[00:35:29.237 --> 00:35:32.459]  He is still hoping today to get some kind of an answer.
[00:35:32.499 --> 00:35:34.540]  They know that this is day 17.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:38.401]  Blair is getting very weak, but he's very courageous.
[00:35:38.501 --> 00:35:49.246]  I don't know how much longer he's going to be able to continue this, but that's where we're at right now, waiting for a response from Senator McCain, who actually does have all the information.
[00:35:50.486 --> 00:35:56.969]  And I'm told that you went down there today to not just visit with Mr. Gadsby, but to also go into the Senator's office.
[00:35:56.989 --> 00:35:58.250]  Who did you talk to in there, Senator?
[00:35:59.226 --> 00:36:01.128]  Well, I have not gone in there today.
[00:36:01.188 --> 00:36:15.700]  Now, I went in there a couple of days ago and gave them a letter, you know, from my office requesting that Senator McCain take the time for this man's sake, and for many of our sakes, to go ahead and meet with him.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.723]  Because this is a critical issue, Alex, as I know that you know.
[00:36:19.743 --> 00:36:27.330]  I mean, in my opinion, 9-11 is the catalyst for all of these issues that have happened, you know, since then.
[00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:52.495]  Our loss of freedoms and liberties pertaining to our Constitution and the Bill of Rights, Homeland Security, oh my gosh, Patriot Act, loss of habeas corpus, the spying on us, the North American Union, Real ID, the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the debacle of the dollar, all of this has come.
[00:36:52.615 --> 00:36:55.836]  I mean, there were things in the works beforehand, but this was the catalyst.
[00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:01.448]  Senator Johnson, any other key points you'd like to add?
[00:37:03.508 --> 00:37:16.791]  Well, yesterday on the floor, I don't know if you're aware, but Blair came down to the Senate, and he was up in the gallery with many, there probably were about 30 9-11 truthers with him, and they held him up.
[00:37:16.931 --> 00:37:23.233]  They literally supported him on each side as we introduced him to the Senators on the floor.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:35.531]  Uh, there and at the Senate, and we gave, you know, just a short speech about 9-11 and why we felt it was so important, and I was happy to be able to do that.
[00:37:36.372 --> 00:37:41.657]  We've practically had a press blackout here in the Phoenix area on that.
[00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:46.822]  There was nothing in the papers today, you know, with any of the papers about this.
[00:37:47.472 --> 00:37:49.333]  Well, we're trying to break that blockade here.
[00:37:49.393 --> 00:37:51.435]  You've certainly got some mainstream media attention.
[00:37:51.775 --> 00:37:52.976]  You're having a great victory.
[00:37:53.216 --> 00:37:56.158]  And that's right, he's so weak that he's having trouble even standing up now.
[00:37:56.999 --> 00:38:00.101]  17 days out there in the 100 plus degree heat.
[00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:01.982]  And we want him to take care of himself.
[00:38:02.683 --> 00:38:05.545]  I wonder how much longer he can hold out, Senator?
[00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:13.190]  You know, I don't know, but it's interesting, Alex, because I think God's watching down on this.
[00:38:13.877 --> 00:38:20.061]  Because I cannot tell you how the temperatures have been so low for this time of year.
[00:38:20.481 --> 00:38:25.525]  We've had good breeze, and it's been in the 90s when we're usually at 110 by now.
[00:38:25.965 --> 00:38:29.527]  So this is quite unusual, and another cold front has moved through.
[00:38:30.008 --> 00:38:35.751]  When I say cold front, that probably sounds funny, but it's brought us back down into the 90s when we're at 101 or 2.
[00:38:36.212 --> 00:38:39.734]  So the weather has been very kind to Blair at this time of year.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.845]  All right, well check in with us in the days as this develops, Senator Johnson, and we commend you for getting the word out every way you can.
[00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:51.029]  In your area, if all of us do similar things, there's no way this cover-up and this mass murder is going to continue.
[00:38:51.369 --> 00:38:57.974]  If we don't, the people that committed the attacks are going to use them to totally overturn our way of life and turn us into a New World Order police state.
[00:38:58.275 --> 00:39:02.518]  Senator, thank you for spending time with us and thanks for going out to get Blair Gadsby support.
[00:39:02.538 --> 00:39:04.179]  God bless you for what you do.
[00:39:04.279 --> 00:39:04.700]  Thank you.
[00:39:05.233 --> 00:39:06.615]  Thank you Senator, thank you so much.
[00:39:06.655 --> 00:39:11.982]  There goes Senator Karen Johnson popping in with us from the side of Blair Gadsby.
[00:39:12.502 --> 00:39:18.230]  Okay, let me get back now into Internet 2.
[00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.413]  Let me just calmly go over the facts here.
[00:39:21.714 --> 00:39:23.396]  Up on screen, recapping,
[00:39:24.801 --> 00:39:28.764]  Up on screen, secret plan to kill internet by 2012 leaked.
[00:39:29.224 --> 00:39:35.768]  Some question of report that pay-per-view system to be introduced is a hoax, but wider march to regulate the web is documented.
[00:39:36.209 --> 00:39:50.258]  And the reason we're covering this in the last few weeks, tens of millions of views on different versions of the same video, with this young lady and others talking about inside sources that told them inside industry that there was a plan by 2012 to go to pay-per-view internet.
[00:39:51.198 --> 00:39:52.619]  Now, I'm not criticizing this group.
[00:39:52.659 --> 00:39:53.200]  I'm glad that
[00:39:54.246 --> 00:39:59.047]  The Infobabe and others got this attention, because now people are asking us hundreds of times a day if this is true.
[00:39:59.548 --> 00:40:00.348]  Yes, it's true!
[00:40:00.848 --> 00:40:03.929]  Let me take you to an article written by Paul Watson.
[00:40:05.549 --> 00:40:10.931]  This story was written March 16, 2006, so that's two years and three months ago.
[00:40:12.612 --> 00:40:23.495]  And if you read this headline, MySpace is the Trojan Horse of Internet Censorship, Media Elite's Last Gap Effort to Save Crumbling Empire, and then in the article there are
[00:40:25.453 --> 00:40:46.861]  Links to mainstream news articles where the Internet2, ICANN, the United Nations, the federal government, the UK Inquirer, and others admitted that under Internet2, 50 corporations, 50 universities, and the government of the United States and other governments working together are going to do several things.
[00:40:46.881 --> 00:40:47.481]  Now here they are
[00:40:48.493 --> 00:40:49.654]  That they're doing in tandem together.
[00:40:50.334 --> 00:40:51.515]  Taxes on the internet.
[00:40:51.555 --> 00:40:53.957]  An internet tax that you have to pay to the federal government.
[00:40:54.517 --> 00:40:56.519]  Just a blanket tax to get on the web yearly.
[00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:57.880]  That then registers you.
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.741]  You've got to enter a registration number in.
[00:41:00.202 --> 00:41:06.066]  Microsoft for at least seven years has been trying to implement thumb printing biometrically for your quote security and all new keyboards.
[00:41:06.446 --> 00:41:07.727]  That they're having trouble implementing that.
[00:41:07.767 --> 00:41:08.328]  That's good news.
[00:41:09.388 --> 00:41:17.095]  They also plan to make you basically pay taxes and an internet stamp on top of it on a cap on emails.
[00:41:17.815 --> 00:41:18.055]  Okay?
[00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:20.578]  They've been demonizing emails and pushing that agenda.
[00:41:21.397 --> 00:41:23.658]  But the big one you hear is net neutrality.
[00:41:24.078 --> 00:41:37.542]  That big internet service providers, but more importantly the backbones like Cogent and Level 3 and others and the main backbones put in by Cisco and the system built by DARPA and the federal government back in the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s.
[00:41:38.222 --> 00:41:48.726]  That they are going to stop communicating with each other unless they have peer-to-peer agreements and unless you buy subscriptions and then you'll have a limited areas that you can go to
[00:41:49.887 --> 00:41:55.138]  And literally 99 plus percent, that's in their own words, of the old web will be walled off.
[00:41:55.218 --> 00:41:56.300]  But that isn't enough for them.
[00:41:57.403 --> 00:42:11.609]  They are going to take the government laid down systems tied in with the telecoms and the big telecommunications hubs and simply not update the old internet hubs and let them fail forcing you onto internet too.
[00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:18.972]  Now remember there is a story up on prisonplanet.com right now that Paul Watson wrote on June 11th 2008 titled
[00:42:22.253 --> 00:42:25.314]  Secret plan to kill the internet by 2012 leaked.
[00:42:25.874 --> 00:42:27.735]  And then this is a 20 page article.
[00:42:27.775 --> 00:42:31.477]  Now if you care anything about the web, you better read this article Paul Watson wrote.
[00:42:31.917 --> 00:42:39.040]  Every paragraph is hyperlinks to government documents, industry insiders, mainstream media reports, where they admit all this.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:49.244]  We can't even get the general public who has been trained to be in denial and deny what's happening to admit that they're trying to get rid of net neutrality, which will destroy the web in and of itself.
[00:42:49.604 --> 00:43:06.071]  We can't even get the public to admit that they're trying to tax the web when states are already doing it, other governments are already doing it, governments are pushing ISPs to put filtering in like China has, universities, corporations already block out InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:06.551 --> 00:43:13.673]  Another facet of InternetTube is that once you're forced over to it, it'll be like MySpace, YouTube, where you'll have your own channel.
[00:43:15.154 --> 00:43:19.975]  And they say this in InternetTube, this big consortium of them meeting and deciding how to build it and set it up.
[00:43:21.035 --> 00:43:24.396]  I learned about it six years ago, but they've been meeting for ten years plus, actually twelve.
[00:43:26.277 --> 00:43:33.759]  They say that you'll sign a contract with them, they'll own your intellectual property, just like YouTube and everybody else says, we have a sub-page, they own it.
[00:43:34.399 --> 00:43:36.000]  Whatever you post, they say they have rights to.
[00:43:37.438 --> 00:43:38.619]  You will have no free speech.
[00:43:38.739 --> 00:43:39.800]  They will own your material.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.063]  They can shut you down, suspend you at will, and they say, oh, well, it's private.
[00:43:44.083 --> 00:43:45.804]  It's like you can't protest in a mall.
[00:43:45.844 --> 00:43:46.845]  They say it's private property.
[00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:48.786]  They control what you say.
[00:43:48.846 --> 00:43:49.867]  They control what you do.
[00:43:50.207 --> 00:43:52.188]  So the new web will be
[00:43:53.542 --> 00:43:54.662]  A hundred domains.
[00:43:54.682 --> 00:43:55.383]  This is what they said in 2001.
[00:43:55.543 --> 00:43:57.083]  They're debating this now.
[00:43:57.643 --> 00:44:00.564]  And that you will have a sub-site on one hundred domains.
[00:44:01.285 --> 00:44:04.586]  There will be institutional and there will be private.
[00:44:04.946 --> 00:44:10.708]  But it will all be regulated by the government, controlled by the corporations and fifty universities slash institutions.
[00:44:11.408 --> 00:44:12.329]  This is the new web.
[00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.349]  Why are they doing this?
[00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.992]  Newspaper circulation down the last 15 years by 60 plus percent.
[00:44:17.212 --> 00:44:18.233]  It's about 65 now.
[00:44:18.553 --> 00:44:20.254]  TV ratings even on cable down.
[00:44:20.314 --> 00:44:21.435]  First cable killed TV.
[00:44:21.695 --> 00:44:23.696]  Broadcast TV now cables being killed by this.
[00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:25.437]  They cannot compete.
[00:44:26.578 --> 00:44:36.705]  When I have millions of people a week listening to millions listening to the podcast, and I'm able to sell advertising and raise the $20,000 a month it takes for our bandwidth, and it's growing,
[00:44:38.775 --> 00:44:45.617]  Understand, they also claim, and they're doing it in Texas and all over, Comcast, Time Warner, they're all announcing, you pay for your internet connection.
[00:44:46.297 --> 00:44:46.718]  You pay $30, $40, $50, $100.
[00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:51.179]  You're paying for the bandwidth that they cost to get it streamed.
[00:44:51.659 --> 00:44:54.160]  I then pay on my end for the server so you can get it.
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.820]  They're making huge profits.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:06.344]  Telecommunications, especially in the Internet, is one of the highest profit ratios left in our society, when everything else, the service economy, the construction economy, the manufacturing economy is imploding.
[00:45:06.624 --> 00:45:10.665]  They're now coming in with regulations, taxes, controls, and they're talking about
[00:45:11.385 --> 00:45:26.494]  for tiny amounts of bandwidth charging you masses of money for this so there's a multi-pronged attack we have a bunch of detailed articles where they say it themselves so basically it's internet users
[00:45:27.722 --> 00:45:30.663]  And companies and people that have stores online, it's all over.
[00:45:30.683 --> 00:45:40.488]  50 companies and 50 universities and government institutions in tandem, that's the government angles of the universities, they will decide what you can have on the web.
[00:45:40.768 --> 00:45:42.069]  They will decide where you can go.
[00:45:42.089 --> 00:45:53.274]  I mean, we're talking about, they say for 200 channels, 200 websites, which will be Time Warner and Google and the rest of it, you will be paying $40 plus a month.
[00:45:53.695 --> 00:45:54.015]  And that's it!
[00:45:54.855 --> 00:45:56.656]  You will not get to Infowars.com.
[00:45:56.917 --> 00:45:58.698]  You will not get to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:01.880]  You will not get to any of these websites.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:20.013]  And I'm begging you, the listeners, to not believe me, to go to PrisonPlanet.com, and all of you out there later watching this on the web, and to read through the last five years, six years, I've been warning you about this, the last two and a half intensely,
[00:46:20.984 --> 00:46:28.848]  The San Francisco Chronicle tech writers didn't believe us, and they wrote a big story covering our article two years ago, our Trojan Horse article.
[00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:31.910]  And that's one of the only mainstream places that has put this out.
[00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:43.317]  So I do want to toot our horn and say that regardless of what your political views are, regardless of what you think of us out there in cyberspace, love us or hate us, we have been on the front lines of studying this and researching it.
[00:46:43.817 --> 00:46:55.949]  I spent hours reading the Internet2 meetings in Austin and in London and in Chicago and in New York and in Tokyo, where they laugh and they always announce at the beginning of their three-day conferences, the Internet is dead!
[00:46:56.509 --> 00:47:01.875]  And it's just like you paid for roads, and then they just come in and have the government hand it over to them.
[00:47:02.415 --> 00:47:05.138]  And then now it's new rules on their roads.
[00:47:05.879 --> 00:47:08.041]  I want to bring Jason Burmiss in here.
[00:47:08.562 --> 00:47:11.405]  And Jason is a huge tech guy, a lot more technical than I am.
[00:47:11.806 --> 00:47:15.850]  Of course, Loose Change Fame, making a new film here with us, working with us the next few months in the office.
[00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:17.392]  Been filling in some on the show.
[00:47:17.412 --> 00:47:19.494]  We've got about three or four minutes before break, Jason.
[00:47:19.755 --> 00:47:21.497]  But I want you for listeners out there,
[00:47:21.977 --> 00:47:26.881]  To explain to them that it's not just net neutrality, it's not just taxation, it's not just bandwidth caps.
[00:47:27.602 --> 00:47:31.785]  It is not building, not maintaining the old hub, forcing you on.
[00:47:31.825 --> 00:47:35.288]  That's their number one goal and that's the part nobody's talking about.
[00:47:35.448 --> 00:47:39.531]  This isn't just net neutrality where the different groups don't communicate with each other anymore.
[00:47:39.871 --> 00:47:45.556]  You buy subscriptions for fractions of the web and it kills that incredible connectivity in that huge community.
[00:47:47.426 --> 00:47:50.909]  The key to all of this is they are going to shut down the old web.
[00:47:51.189 --> 00:47:51.829]  Jason Burmas.
[00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:59.455]  Yeah, I mean, I was shocked when I read that they're actually beta testing this right now, not only in America, but in Texas, in Beaumont, Texas.
[00:47:59.495 --> 00:48:00.937]  And how it works, folks, is this.
[00:48:01.517 --> 00:48:06.581]  They're not only going to limit the amount that you can download, but they're also going to limit the speed at which you can download it.
[00:48:06.661 --> 00:48:12.185]  So, for five gigabytes a month, they want to charge you $30, and it's at a reduced rate.
[00:48:12.205 --> 00:48:13.386]  It's like a DSL line.
[00:48:13.466 --> 00:48:15.047]  Now, they know that they could give you more,
[00:48:15.888 --> 00:48:16.849]  But they want to limit you.
[00:48:17.289 --> 00:48:20.491]  And then if you go over this five gigabytes, well then you're in the next price range.
[00:48:20.511 --> 00:48:23.512]  You're at forty gigabytes and that's instead of thirty dollars, it's forty five.
[00:48:23.572 --> 00:48:25.373]  Now here's where it gets really tricky.
[00:48:26.194 --> 00:48:30.056]  Once you go over that forty gigabyte limit, which is nothing folks, let me clue you in.
[00:48:30.096 --> 00:48:34.318]  If you watch a movie on Google Video, okay, something that's a little over an hour long, that's one gigabyte.
[00:48:34.598 --> 00:48:36.899]  You surf the web for a couple days, that's another gigabyte.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:44.984]  If you're one of the people like me who likes to share movies on file share networks, likes to upload things to FTP sites to other people, does it for work,
[00:48:45.504 --> 00:48:47.465]  We're talking about a dollar each gigabyte.
[00:48:47.505 --> 00:48:52.507]  So say I'm working on a project with Alex Jones, and I have to send uncompressed video to Alex.
[00:48:52.907 --> 00:48:59.989]  Well, that uncompressed video could be anywhere from 10 to 20 gigabytes itself, so I'm going to be charged another 10 to 20 dollars just for that day.
[00:49:00.729 --> 00:49:05.611]  And you're talking about bills that could be in the hundreds, if not thousands, in private businesses.
[00:49:06.451 --> 00:49:07.292]  Now let me explain what they do.
[00:49:08.379 --> 00:49:15.226]  They built our society sprawling, whether you love it or hate it, where we have to have fuel, where our cities are built out, unless you're talking about Boston or New York.
[00:49:15.727 --> 00:49:17.088]  You've got to have fuel to get to work.
[00:49:17.548 --> 00:49:21.572]  They control that, their own documents come out, they jack up the oil prices and squeeze us.
[00:49:22.113 --> 00:49:31.843]  The government builds the web, they design it, we pay to build the grid with our internet fees, with our connection fees, with our server fees, and then they just take it all away, Jason.
[00:49:32.003 --> 00:49:32.383]  Absolutely.
[00:49:32.423 --> 00:49:33.324]  It's supply and demand.
[00:49:33.364 --> 00:49:35.626]  If they have the only supply, they can demand whatever they like.
[00:49:36.086 --> 00:49:37.067]  And that's what we're seeing.
[00:49:37.407 --> 00:49:39.769]  And one of the things that you didn't... And the crime is just killing the old way.
[00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:40.570]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.071]  And right now, let me explain how it works.
[00:49:42.091 --> 00:49:43.633]  You have an IP address on your computer.
[00:49:43.733 --> 00:49:46.695]  Everybody who goes on your computer logs in through that IP address.
[00:49:46.735 --> 00:49:52.039]  In the future, in Internet 2, you're going to have a biometric thumb scan on your keyboard... And they say this!
[00:49:52.099 --> 00:49:54.001]  Yes, and... It's not a conspiracy theory!
[00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:56.064]  No, this is what we're being trained for right now.
[00:49:56.084 --> 00:49:59.349]  Some of the new laptops have it, and you can't get on your laptop unless it's your thumbprint.
[00:49:59.689 --> 00:50:03.074]  So now, your household, your kids, your wife... Stay there.
[00:50:03.315 --> 00:50:05.558]  For the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, I'm going to continue in the break.
[00:50:05.758 --> 00:50:07.701]  Brothers will come back with the final five minutes.
[00:50:08.042 --> 00:50:08.542]  Stay with us.
[00:50:08.622 --> 00:50:09.464]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:12.692]  Jason, continue for everybody.
[00:50:12.872 --> 00:50:16.875]  Yeah, so this thumb scan, in other words, so it won't be just one IP address, Alex.
[00:50:17.175 --> 00:50:19.896]  It'll be your biometric thumbprint from that IP address.
[00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:32.064]  So instead of saying, all right, the Johnson family is on the internet today or joined this website, it's going to be Bobby Johnson or Kenny Johnson or Sally Johnson, whoever scans their little thumb, and that'll be their little profile.
[00:50:33.385 --> 00:50:41.994]  You know, someone comes in and says, you visited this website, you can say, well, I don't know if it was me, it might have been my wife, I have other people on the net, I have friends, they come over and use the internet.
[00:50:42.054 --> 00:50:45.057]  Now they're going to know that you are the one on the net.
[00:50:45.077 --> 00:50:46.939]  And this is guilty until proven innocent.
[00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:52.164]  So what's happening is, when DARPA and the National Security Agency built and designed
[00:50:53.085 --> 00:51:16.350]  uh... the web in the sixties they call it worldwide wiretap that was the joke w-w-w dot that was the joke worldwide wiretap and so we love it it's great in empowers liberty they're getting rid of it we're destroying them and again i learned of the six years ago i i found out that internet has been around for twelve years uh... they were planning a twenty years ago and and and you go read internet to documents you go read their minutes this is a nice
[00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:20.753]  They say they're doing all of this, and I warned you five, six years ago.
[00:51:20.773 --> 00:51:22.034]  I told you it was coming.
[00:51:22.214 --> 00:51:23.115]  Now it's here.
[00:51:23.595 --> 00:51:24.496]  Now it's happening.
[00:51:24.977 --> 00:51:26.438]  And they're already phasing it in, in 2008.
[00:51:26.498 --> 00:51:27.999]  And they say by 2002, the web won't be what it was.
[00:51:28.059 --> 00:51:28.620]  And by 2012, it's over.
[00:51:32.683 --> 00:51:36.124]  You will not be able to get to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:51:37.065 --> 00:51:38.565]  And that's another form of piracy.
[00:51:38.946 --> 00:51:43.708]  To get through other internet service providers, they're going to make you pay a premium to be able to get through to me.
[00:51:43.928 --> 00:51:47.649]  So that's basically stealing our content, stealing our intellectual property.
[00:51:47.929 --> 00:51:49.710]  This is just high criminal activity.
[00:51:49.790 --> 00:51:54.954]  And then say a PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber watches a dozen of your videos in a month.
[00:51:55.054 --> 00:52:02.159]  All of a sudden their bill's going to double and maybe triple and they're going to say, When they already paid $5.95 because I have servers that I'm paying for.
[00:52:02.379 --> 00:52:03.339]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:04.320]  It's total thievery.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.843]  And what people have to understand is about 10% of the people out there use about 90% of the bandwidth.
[00:52:09.924 --> 00:52:11.805]  Grandma isn't using this bandwidth.
[00:52:11.825 --> 00:52:16.868]  You know, she's still going to pay $30 a month or $45 a month whether she uses 5 gigs or not.
[00:52:16.888 --> 00:52:23.851]  But by the nature of the web with this internet too, they're talking about it using 5, 6, 10, 20, 100 times the bandwidth.
[00:52:24.271 --> 00:52:27.613]  And so you have to understand that we're talking about prices that no one's going to be able to pay.
[00:52:28.013 --> 00:52:30.974]  And you gotta understand, bandwidth is getting cheaper, memory is getting cheaper.
[00:52:31.334 --> 00:52:36.576]  They literally now have a disk... That's right, I used to buy a 1 gigabyte memory stick for my camera, it was $150, now it's like $5, $10.
[00:52:36.776 --> 00:52:46.499]  Not even $5, yeah, $5 or $10 on the web, but what's really incredible is now on a size of a DVD, you can literally, they have a new disk for a terabyte of information, folks.
[00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.761]  Now that is a terabyte, that is a thousand gigabytes, that's huge.
[00:52:51.281 --> 00:52:59.187]  This is them trying to stop the renaissance, to stop the printing press, hold back the entirety of human development society, which is the globalists are known for.
[00:52:59.427 --> 00:53:05.032]  They say in their own Club of Rome documents and internet too, they want to suppress technological development and control free speech.
[00:53:05.272 --> 00:53:06.653]  Let's go back to the main radio show now.
[00:53:16.818 --> 00:53:19.780]  Again, I hear all these Americans asking why oil prices are so high.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.261]  OPEC says why.
[00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:24.903]  Congressional reports say the dollar's been devalued by over 60%.
[00:53:25.203 --> 00:53:26.744]  The public knows nothing.
[00:53:27.545 --> 00:53:35.349]  I tell the public they're planning to incrementally shut down the web, shut down the hubs, force you onto systems that are quote corporate or governmental where they say you have no free speech.
[00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:39.412]  Congress is having meetings showing 9-11 truth, saying we've got to restrict free speech.
[00:53:39.652 --> 00:53:41.973]  The Bilderberg Group met this weekend in Chantilly.
[00:53:41.993 --> 00:53:42.614]  We went and covered it.
[00:53:42.814 --> 00:53:45.635]  We forced them to put out a press release for the second time in their history.
[00:53:46.736 --> 00:53:49.659]  Saying they wanted to restrict free speech on the web in their own admission.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.961]  We've destroyed the establishment media.
[00:53:53.664 --> 00:53:55.725]  I see him trying to put it back in Pandora's box.
[00:53:55.825 --> 00:53:58.146]  I don't think it's going to work, but we've got to push harder than ever.
[00:53:58.446 --> 00:54:07.090]  While we still have somewhat free access, I mean, we've already, for going back eight, nine years, I've got ISPs admitting in England, in Germany, in the U.S., they block InfoWars all the time.
[00:54:07.391 --> 00:54:17.055]  We've already been dealing with this censorship, or Google not showing our stories headlines, or not showing that we're number one, we're really number one, being caught, dig, caught cheating.
[00:54:17.275 --> 00:54:19.997]  They already do it per website, because we're kicking their butt.
[00:54:20.337 --> 00:54:21.497]  I mean, you'll have 25,000 comments on one of my
[00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:25.920]  web post on YouTube, it'll say a thousand views.
[00:54:26.361 --> 00:54:28.622]  How do you have 25,000 comments and a thousand views?
[00:54:28.863 --> 00:54:32.605]  They're cheating, ladies and gentlemen, because they can't beat the signal.
[00:54:32.726 --> 00:54:34.287]  They can't beat the InfoWars.
[00:54:35.067 --> 00:54:35.708]  Jason Bernis.
[00:54:35.848 --> 00:54:38.590]  Yes, and now they're going to try to restrict that signal.
[00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:49.058]  They're going to restrict the content you can have and I'll be very doubtful if anyone will carry InfoWars.com or PrismPlanet.com or any of the sites that are really putting it out there.
[00:54:49.078 --> 00:54:52.621]  And I wouldn't even be surprised that when you post something, they'll have a screener
[00:54:53.181 --> 00:54:53.982]  No, no, no.
[00:54:54.002 --> 00:55:03.869]  I was at two hotels this last week, and both hotel internet said, you're going to a website that doesn't have a proper security certificate, which these weren't secure sites, there's no reason for that.
[00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.331]  Are you sure you want to go to this dangerous website?
[00:55:06.811 --> 00:55:10.234]  I mean, I'm already banned in most universities, most libraries, most corporations.
[00:55:10.594 --> 00:55:12.295]  I know five people have been fired for Dell.
[00:55:12.656 --> 00:55:14.757]  They're allowed to visit stuff on lunch, but not InfoWars.
[00:55:14.817 --> 00:55:15.598]  It's considered terror.
[00:55:16.298 --> 00:55:26.802]  And then you look at the Bilderberg press release and they talk about cyber-terrorism and it's very interesting that now some of these war games, these drills, the red team happens to be anti-globalist hackers, Alex.
[00:55:27.122 --> 00:55:33.104]  See, people who know how to use a computer and are against globalism and the elite, they're terrorists now.
[00:55:33.224 --> 00:55:34.445]  That's basically what they're trying to do.
[00:55:34.605 --> 00:55:37.286]  The anti-globalist hackers are going to get into the infrastructure.
[00:55:37.826 --> 00:55:50.071]  You better appreciate InfoWars, Prison Planet, the Genesis Network, and all the other groups that are out there, and we all better stop fighting with each other over what group runs it, or who says it right, or who makes mistakes.
[00:55:50.451 --> 00:55:53.832]  We better get together and say, we're against getting rid of our borders in the North American Union.
[00:55:54.072 --> 00:55:55.673]  We're against getting rid of net neutrality.
[00:55:55.873 --> 00:55:57.153]  We're against Internet 2.
[00:55:57.413 --> 00:56:00.214]  We're against them filtering content as Comcast and others.
[00:56:00.475 --> 00:56:01.575]  Hundreds of them admit they're doing it.
[00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:04.036]  It's already been going on, like China.
[00:56:04.216 --> 00:56:05.997]  They can end the free web tomorrow.
[00:56:06.217 --> 00:56:09.219]  Basically, Internet2 is the same Chinese filtered model.
[00:56:09.519 --> 00:56:10.159]  They admit that.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.101]  IBM, Cisco, they're over there running that.
[00:56:13.361 --> 00:56:16.423]  Yahoo and Google help run the censorship for China.
[00:56:16.623 --> 00:56:17.223]  They admit it.
[00:56:17.623 --> 00:56:18.224]  This is it.
[00:56:18.324 --> 00:56:22.326]  If you want free web, if you want what you've been having, it is about to end.
[00:56:22.366 --> 00:56:23.706]  You better go to InfoWars.com.
[00:56:24.947 --> 00:56:35.172]  And get this story, Secret Plan to Kill the Internet by 2012 leaked, and all these stories, and you better get this video and put it up on YouTube and Google and spread it, folks, because it means all of us are going to lose it.
[00:56:35.352 --> 00:56:45.297]  And I want to see all those other activist sites and others to stop sucking their thumbs and obsessing on little side issues and things and spend a little time spending it on hardcore stuff like this.
[00:56:45.457 --> 00:56:48.619]  Again, we were there first warning you because we read source documents.
[00:56:49.399 --> 00:56:53.281]  Yeah, if they don't do that, then they won't have a forum to gripe, really, Alex.
[00:56:53.301 --> 00:56:58.563]  There will be no forum where we can discuss these matters at all, because their websites will be shut down as well.
[00:56:58.583 --> 00:57:09.748]  And it is so important that we have this alternative source of media, mainly because, you know, do we want an internet that's not going to report that Kucinich put out 35 articles of impeachment like the mainstream media didn't?
[00:57:09.949 --> 00:57:10.469]  Not on CBS.
[00:57:11.049 --> 00:57:13.110]  Not on Fox, not on CNN, nothing.
[00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:14.531]  No mainstream reporters.
[00:57:14.571 --> 00:57:15.812]  Great point on that.
[00:57:15.892 --> 00:57:18.774]  No mainstream reporters on the White House memo, the Downing Street memo.
[00:57:18.814 --> 00:57:20.595]  We break the news you see years later.
[00:57:21.236 --> 00:57:23.698]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:23.918 --> 00:57:26.019]  For anybody that missed any of it, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:57:26.059 --> 00:57:26.800]  Click on those streams.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.520]  God bless you all.
[00:57:28.701 --> 00:57:30.222]  Thank you for listening to CNN.
[00:57:32.123 --> 00:57:32.784]  God bless you all.
[00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:33.744]  That's it for transmission.
[00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:37.447]  I was thinking about going over, but we're going to go ahead and just end this now.
[00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:38.288]  Good job, network.
[00:57:38.508 --> 00:57:38.788]  Now.
[00:57:39.248 --> 00:57:40.369]  I really do appreciate the network.
