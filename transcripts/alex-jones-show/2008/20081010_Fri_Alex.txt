[00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:10.633]  All right, Alan Watt joined us in the last segment.
[00:00:10.653 --> 00:00:17.736]  We just went ahead and went live on PrisonPlanet.tv for the PrisonPlanet.tv members and folks listening on the Infowars.com streams.
[00:00:18.296 --> 00:00:19.416]  Those exclusive streams.
[00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.437]  We'll be skipping some of the breaks for behind-the-scenes discussion with Alan Watt.
[00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:28.680]  Alan, because we just went live on TV, recap what's happening with the controlled economic implosion
[00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:33.630]  The key fact you raised that they announced the market was going to die two weeks ago.
[00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.111]  We didn't give them dictatorial powers.
[00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:38.573]  Martial law was threatened against congressmen.
[00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:40.374]  We had them on, and it was on C-SPAN.
[00:00:40.694 --> 00:00:44.137]  We're seeing unprecedented things happening.
[00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:47.279]  Because the New World Order, as you know, the listeners may not, works in phases.
[00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.340]  And then they have these jump phases.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.841]  They build slowly, then they jump.
[00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.143]  We are entering a jump phase, are we not?
[00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:54.303]  We are.
[00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:56.025]  It's long-term plans.
[00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:56.525]  Very long.
[00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:57.906]  In fact, intergenerational.
[00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.321]  And that's the key to the success of it.
[00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:07.723]  It's always so slow, and then they hit you, and then slow again for a while until we adapt to the new system, and then they hit you again.
[00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:13.925]  But it's all designed to bring us into a global society, this new world order that Bush Sr.
[00:01:13.965 --> 00:01:14.605]  talked about.
[00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:22.308]  It's also a brave new world type of system, but first we must go through the Orwellian phase of it, with the big boots stamping on the face.
[00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:23.545]  Uh, forever.
[00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:30.770]  That's what we're going through now with the children ratting on parents, with the government in control of everything that you do economically.
[00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:41.137]  There'll be so many regulations now according to what you can buy, according to your status, your actual status to the system, because in this system, eventually there'll be no private property.
[00:01:41.177 --> 00:01:42.238]  That's stated already.
[00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:43.659]  That's one of their mandates.
[00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:56.444]  So they're going to eventually have government coming into private property, gradually taking it all over, and then you're dependent on government for your very survival and for your work and all the rest of it.
[00:01:56.904 --> 00:02:12.550]  This is the brave new world they're heading towards, but first they must train us all into it, and it's a training exercise as much as anything else, to get the public of the world terrified, so that we will accept all of the incredible rules and regulations that are coming down the pike.
[00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:26.522]  We will come out of this, as I say, much more with a reduced population, with an economic system that will never ever be the same again, and we're all supposed to serve what they call the world state.
[00:02:26.602 --> 00:02:28.283]  That will be our only duty.
[00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:40.174]  And the key to taking over private property is the carbon tax and the new environmental overlays, which they're now announcing to the public, from the Club of Rome documents, when people laughed at us, to now implementation.
[00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:41.216]  That's right.
[00:02:41.236 --> 00:02:43.577]  The Club of Rome was the main think-tank.
[00:02:43.597 --> 00:02:46.699]  Now all these think-tanks are connected at the top.
[00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.783]  There's the pyramid structure, the thousand points of light, with the NGOs working for them to bring in social policy.
[00:02:54.663 --> 00:03:03.668]  And the Club of Rome stated in their own book, towards the first global revolution, the two founders who wrote the book stated that they came up with the idea
[00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:04.905]  Of course.
[00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:19.964]  Yes, that's a fact.
[00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:20.424]  And not only that,
[00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:50.442]  Um, you see, what we're getting from the media is what we're supposed to be told.
[00:03:51.144 --> 00:03:54.032]  The panic and the hype and all the information about the war and so on.
[00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:58.373]  But what they don't tell you are the other things that are happening.
[00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:03.316]  See, total war has been carried out on the population of the world for years now.
[00:04:03.916 --> 00:04:06.238]  With inoculations, that was all part of it too.
[00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:11.481]  That helps dumb us down, makes us sick, to reduce the population, it destroys the immune system.
[00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:18.625]  And for ten years solid now, they've been spraying the planet with aerial spraying almost every morning.
[00:04:19.105 --> 00:04:22.147]  Altering the weather, so they're using a lot of hidden weaponry.
[00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:25.029]  That came out from the silent weapons agenda.
[00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:38.097]  And just recently, Alan, it's now the government's admitted, they're altering the atmosphere, they're doing other tests, hundreds of universities and agencies are involved, so they've come out in mainstream papers the last few months and just calmly announced it.
[00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:41.079]  Yes, after the fact, they've been doing it for years.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.860]  So, we're being attacked.
[00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:46.603]  The world is being attacked through our food supply, it's all been altered as well.
[00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:56.484]  And you don't get big secret organizations coming together from biowarfare industries to make better carrots or potatoes.
[00:04:56.504 --> 00:04:58.025]  There's something else going on here.
[00:04:58.686 --> 00:05:03.552]  And we know for a fact that cancers, for instance, of the stomach are skyrocketing.
[00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:10.042]  And that's what they showed when even rats and mice were tested with the GMO vegetables and so on.
[00:05:10.062 --> 00:05:16.326]  I want to tell the police and military, all of you that serve the system, FBI agents, laugh all you want when you're putting your kid in a coffin.
[00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:17.007]  It's not a joke.
[00:05:17.327 --> 00:05:18.288]  They are killing us.
[00:05:19.028 --> 00:05:21.930]  1 in 33 with cancer to 1 in 2 males and 1 in 3 females.
[00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:23.251]  I'm going to skip this.
[00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:25.853]  Just for the internet audience, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:05:26.274 --> 00:05:31.078]  You can watch, if you're a member there, or free on the internet at the info or streams.
[00:05:31.118 --> 00:05:31.759]  It's too important.
[00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:32.780]  We got that one on late.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.563]  So we're going to skip this break and the next with my guest.
[00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:38.726]  We'll be back for everybody else in just three minutes.
[00:05:40.147 --> 00:05:40.988]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:41.068 --> 00:05:46.873]  We'll continue to watch the global stock market meltdown by design as they call for a new world order.
[00:05:48.286 --> 00:05:49.587]  Alan, why are they now?
[00:05:49.847 --> 00:05:51.108]  Why were they ready now?
[00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:53.730]  And are they on schedule?
[00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.454]  Because there is a huge awakening take place, but it didn't matter of a thousand to one phone calls, and that's on record.
[00:05:59.774 --> 00:06:02.296]  Over a thousand to one in some cases, the people were against it.
[00:06:02.756 --> 00:06:04.797]  Congress was then just threatened with martial law.
[00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:09.360]  So it's not just that the public isn't going along with it, now the establishment doesn't care.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.122]  That's correct.
[00:06:11.762 --> 00:06:13.003]  Now it seems the right time.
[00:06:13.023 --> 00:06:17.266]  These guys, especially with the internet, they can take constant polls, daily polls,
[00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:25.220]  Because the traffic on the internet, they know what the public think, what they want, and even where the confusion lies, and they exploit the confusion factor.
[00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:29.604]  So it's psychological war, but it's really intelligence gathering as well.
[00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:39.211]  These guys don't make mistakes, they know exactly when to hit us, and what a more perfect time to hit us, when they've declared a worldwide war on terror, this vague term.
[00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:47.474]  It isn't until you realize that they're talking about everyone who lives with an idea that the old system is okay, the system they grew up in.
[00:06:47.954 --> 00:06:49.975]  Anyone who believes that is therefore a terrorist.
[00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:54.597]  These guys are bringing us into the new world order, as George Bush Sr.
[00:06:54.637 --> 00:06:55.257]  kept telling us.
[00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:58.839]  It's a new world order, a new system of running things.
[00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.402]  A new way of living, that's the most important thing of all.
[00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:08.186]  You won't be able to just breed as you wish to, pass your genes on, pick a mate.
[00:07:08.907 --> 00:07:10.869]  All of that's coming through now through different factors.
[00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.592]  That's what they mean, you know, no law of the jungle, which we think of barbarism as law of the jungle.
[00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:21.177]  No, they mean the law of the jungle, meeting, marrying who you want, living where you want, owning your own property.
[00:07:21.197 --> 00:07:22.138]  No, no, no, no.
[00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:23.639]  The rule of the New World Order.
[00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:25.092]  That's correct.
[00:07:25.152 --> 00:07:26.874]  And that's what the pyramid stands for.
[00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:28.497]  It sits on the wasteland.
[00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:32.422]  The wasteland happens to be the profane, meaning the general public.
[00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:33.624]  That's what they mean by that.
[00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:36.828]  What do you see happening in the short term?
[00:07:37.662 --> 00:07:41.425]  The short term, governments will come in and gradually take over.
[00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:46.409]  See, governments don't have to take over everything in any particular sector.
[00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:57.098]  As long as they have shares in it, they come in with rules and regulations, that goes with all the different organizations that already receive subsidies, etc., from government.
[00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:04.583]  Yeah, that sets the precedent in something that sounds reasonable, and pretty soon it's getting a $10,000 fine for dropping a banana peel.
[00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:31.040]  That's right, and they already have the big move on again from this quiet organization, this United Nations, that was set up to be the front for world government.
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:46.389]  Eventually, it's now getting teeth, and they already have mandated that inspectors go around homes, even through the rural areas, and fine you thousands of dollars if there's even a downpipe from your gutter that happens to have a hole in it, or is bent, or whatever, or plugged.
[00:08:46.689 --> 00:08:51.032]  I mean, they're going the whole route of punishment and using economics to punish the public.
[00:08:51.132 --> 00:08:53.254]  But it's all for the earth, so it's okay.
[00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:56.176]  Alan, we're going back to the full audience right now.
[00:08:56.556 --> 00:08:57.017]  Here we go.
[00:08:57.037 --> 00:09:11.368]  Alan Watt, talk show host, documentary maker, author.
[00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:14.271]  We're going to give you his website in just a moment.
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.842]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:18.102 --> 00:09:20.327]  We are watching the controlled economic collapse.
[00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:22.972]  I forgot to ask John during the break.
[00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:25.698]  John, how far away are you from having those audio clips I wanted?
[00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:26.419]  It's done.
[00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:27.441]  It's done.
[00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:36.605]  I do not attack zeitgeist addendum out of any malice or anger towards the individual that made it.
[00:09:37.086 --> 00:09:38.427]  I don't know their New World Order.
[00:09:39.108 --> 00:09:42.010]  I don't know if they're trying to co-opt the Liberty or Awakening movement.
[00:09:44.173 --> 00:09:47.236]  I agree with a lot of what is in the first zeitgeist, disagree with some of it.
[00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:51.981]  Anything that gets you to think outside the box I think is overall healthy, but the new one
[00:09:53.598 --> 00:09:54.959]  Follows exactly what H.G.
[00:09:54.979 --> 00:09:57.261]  Wells wrote in The Open Conspiracy, what H.G.
[00:09:57.301 --> 00:10:05.067]  Wells wrote in The New World Order, his non-fiction books, and it was made into the film Things to Come.
[00:10:06.508 --> 00:10:22.760]  The communists, the socialists, funded by the bankers to consolidate the mass into this communal system that the technocrats control, they always frame it all in technology and high-tech and not having to work and utopia.
[00:10:24.648 --> 00:10:41.161]  And what you see in the film, Things to Come, adapted from one of Wells' books, is a call for a world dictatorship of these benevolent, secret society, quote, masons.
[00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:44.236]  And they will come in and bomb and kill.
[00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:46.837]  They will come in and spray knockout gas on your cities.
[00:10:46.857 --> 00:10:47.517]  That's in the book.
[00:10:47.757 --> 00:10:48.498]  That's in the film.
[00:10:48.878 --> 00:10:50.498]  I meant to put a lot of this in the endgame.
[00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:51.319]  I just didn't have time.
[00:10:51.739 --> 00:10:53.200]  And then I saw the Corbett Report.
[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.401]  We put a link up on InfoWars.com and an analysis of things to come in Blade Runner.
[00:10:57.962 --> 00:11:02.744]  And I saw it this morning and it reminded me of earlier this week when I did a critique of Zeitgeist Addendum.
[00:11:03.444 --> 00:11:11.228]  Where they have the well-meaning, you know, socialist on there talking about, none of us will have to work, there'll be no more classes, it will be eradicated.
[00:11:11.628 --> 00:11:16.650]  But that is a class, that is the state eradicating with strict rules, control.
[00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.272]  You can't look good, you can't say what looks good, because that makes a class.
[00:11:20.632 --> 00:11:21.952]  You can't be better at something.
[00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:26.454]  And again, you have this overarching technocrat elite, like in THX 1138,
[00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:37.804]  Which again is from Huxley's work, which he admits before he died in a Berkeley speech was actually what the government of England was planning, his brother running the UN at UNESCO.
[00:11:37.884 --> 00:11:44.870]  So I wanted to first play for Alan Watt a clip from Zeitgeist Addendum Part 10.
[00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:55.397]  We played a few days ago where this well-meaning individual, and I have no doubt the vitriol he's got, you know, they believe in it, this utopia from the machines.
[00:11:55.537 --> 00:12:11.868]  But see, the prime directive of the machines is to control, dominate, and displace humans so we're not needed, so we can then be culled, as Bill Joy warned the public in his April 2000 article in Wired Magazine when he went to a globalist conference, and they were talking about how to exterminate the majority of us.
[00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:13.409]  I mean, this is really going on.
[00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.591]  So, here's the clip from Zeitgeist.
[00:12:16.231 --> 00:12:20.952]  We're such an abominable, sick society that we won't make the history book.
[00:12:21.292 --> 00:12:33.935]  If you say that large nations took land from smaller nations, used force and violence, you'll get history talked about as corrupt behavior all the way along until the beginning of the civilized world.
[00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:36.355]  That's when all the nations worked together.
[00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:44.837]  World unification, working toward common good for all human beings, and without anyone being
[00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:56.531]  Subservient to anyone else, without social stratification, whether it be technical elitism or any other kind of elitism, eradicated from the face of the earth.
[00:12:58.396 --> 00:13:01.919]  What's interesting about it is it doesn't say in the movie
[00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:36.244]  How they'll get to that stage, and they keep mentioning to sustainability, that means reduction of population.
[00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:40.987]  It means, obviously, that again, there's going to be a eugenics program in place.
[00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:57.439]  We have to go back, as you say, into time, and we see this emerging with theosophy in Britain, and Madame Blavatsky was put out there to the public to start off a branch, mainly to get a lot of women into this movement, but also men as well.
[00:13:58.155 --> 00:14:00.996]  And we know that the High Masons ran this organization.
[00:14:01.076 --> 00:14:05.779]  In fact, Besant, who took over from Bobetzky, was a daughter of Lord Besant.
[00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:10.121]  Now Besant itself is the name of the standard of the Knights Templars.
[00:14:10.341 --> 00:14:12.302]  That was the name of Besant.
[00:14:12.362 --> 00:14:16.064]  So even their names were phony, but they used them in real life.
[00:14:16.864 --> 00:14:22.487]  So they came up with Krishnamurti, who was to be a saviour of the world, a new messiah.
[00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:27.169]  And he was trained by these lords, these High Masons, to do what he did.
[00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:32.257]  And this movie, I noticed, started off with Krishnamurti talking.
[00:14:33.517 --> 00:14:36.918]  So here is a theosophist bringing in the theosophical worldview.
[00:14:37.258 --> 00:14:45.600]  Now let's not forget, we jump forward, Adolf Hitler and all the boys around him based the Nazi ideology on theosophy.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.600]  They were theosophists.
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.941]  They did believe in eugenics.
[00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:52.841]  That was a prime tenet of theosophy.
[00:14:53.902 --> 00:14:55.602]  Special breeding, selective breeding.
[00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:58.844]  We know this was happening already in the 1800s.
[00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:09.531]  We see with Charles Darwin's family, they kept interbreeding with... Well, we see them talking about total, absolute tyranny, where you're not allowed to be a better painter, you're not allowed to know more about math.
[00:15:09.751 --> 00:15:13.553]  That's why they say they're going to drug and engineer everyone to be the suboid class.
[00:15:13.593 --> 00:15:17.435]  This is the ultimate darkness, and they mix it in with 9-11 truth.
[00:15:17.796 --> 00:15:21.878]  They mix it in with anti-New World Order, when the New World Order is the author of this.
[00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:23.619]  Let me play the next clip.
[00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:25.080]  This is from Things to Come.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.546]  And in the film, they're flying around with perfect B-2 bombers, nerve-gassing the people, the barbarous that won't submit.
[00:15:32.826 --> 00:15:37.110]  They're in black uniforms around council tables, setting up their new world order.
[00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:38.171]  This is it.
[00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:38.651]  Here it is.
[00:15:39.532 --> 00:15:43.475]  Who are all of the left of the old engineers and mechanics have pledged ourselves to salvage the world.
[00:15:43.995 --> 00:15:45.457]  We have the airways, all that's left of them.
[00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:46.437]  We have the seas.
[00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:48.339]  And we have ideas in common.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.221]  The brotherhood of efficiency.
[00:15:50.641 --> 00:15:51.862]  The Freemasonry of science.
[00:15:52.873 --> 00:15:54.935]  This is how I conceive our plan of operations.
[00:15:55.395 --> 00:15:56.616]  First, a round-up of brigands.
[00:15:57.336 --> 00:16:00.739]  At last, dismal vestige of ancient predatory soldiers.
[00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:03.881]  The last would-be conquerors.
[00:16:03.941 --> 00:16:04.522]  Then settle.
[00:16:05.683 --> 00:16:06.143]  Organize.
[00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:07.064]  Advance.
[00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:08.885]  This zone, then that.
[00:16:09.606 --> 00:16:11.827]  And at last, wings over the world.
[00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:14.029]  And a new world begins.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:23.362]  By the way, there's a part in the movie where he lands at the airbase, and they're taking over with a dictatorship, and the guy says, I'm not going to turn over my guns to you.
[00:16:24.162 --> 00:16:27.063]  And he says, look, this is a new world order, and then they nerve gas him.
[00:16:27.543 --> 00:16:28.704]  And then that's peaceful, though.
[00:16:28.724 --> 00:16:32.045]  Well, because we're for the good, we're allowed to disarm you.
[00:16:32.065 --> 00:16:33.665]  Uh-huh.
[00:16:34.205 --> 00:16:37.686]  And again, that's the exact stuff we're hearing out of the zeitgeist.
[00:16:37.726 --> 00:16:42.528]  And they first did a 9-11 film to get everybody on board, saying, oh, this is good, and now we see this.
[00:16:42.588 --> 00:16:43.008]  Alan, what?
[00:16:44.176 --> 00:16:45.937]  Yeah, this, as I say, is an old agenda.
[00:16:46.118 --> 00:16:46.978]  They've never changed.
[00:16:47.018 --> 00:17:01.609]  Now, it was tied in with the Nazi movement, and it was also tied in with the Communist movement, because Lenin also said that eventually, towards the end of the millennium, the year 2000, he said, the state will gradually wither away.
[00:17:02.029 --> 00:17:05.251]  And sure enough, we'd already had statements before to the year 2000,
[00:17:06.454 --> 00:17:10.155]  By Bruce Senior talking about the New World Order coming into view.
[00:17:10.756 --> 00:17:16.478]  But all that is, is the old state and the family being absorbed into the technocrat global corporate system.
[00:17:16.858 --> 00:17:22.860]  Absolutely, a world system where the United Nations was to be given the teeth that it was set up to have.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.401]  And this is the key to it.
[00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:33.864]  All the cries now are going towards, we need a world system, a world government, a world economic bank to run the whole planet.
[00:17:35.136 --> 00:17:36.497]  Which is in things to come.
[00:17:36.517 --> 00:17:41.680]  There's an economic crash and wars which they engineer and then they pick up the pieces.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:42.901]  Same system.
[00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:44.522]  Same system.
[00:17:45.202 --> 00:17:49.785]  And a world without poverty can only happen when you eradicate the poor.
[00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:51.205]  That's part of it.
[00:17:51.245 --> 00:17:55.688]  See, into a technological system you don't need such a large population.
[00:17:55.728 --> 00:18:01.091]  In fact, it's based on having a very small population being served by technology.
[00:18:02.078 --> 00:18:03.940]  So, this is the agenda.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:15.470]  I don't think you noticed in the architectural magazines that they're setting up a pyramid, they've drafted up a pyramid town, or city, for Dubai, where it literally is a machine.
[00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.292]  You live inside a machine.
[00:18:18.653 --> 00:18:21.796]  Now, not everyone can get in, obviously, to this machine.
[00:18:21.816 --> 00:18:23.758]  It's going to be selective people only.
[00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:27.041]  They're already setting up the future right now, as we live.
[00:18:27.768 --> 00:18:35.311]  And we are probably the last of our kind if this succeeds as they gradually reduce us with sicknesses and diseases and so on.
[00:18:44.875 --> 00:18:51.557]  And I've had elitists tell me this, so that when they set up the police state in the next decade or so, then they can have the controlled bioweapons releases.
[00:18:51.858 --> 00:18:53.338]  That will kill the majority of us.
[00:18:53.438 --> 00:18:54.779]  And folks, we've been right about everything else.
[00:18:55.299 --> 00:19:03.702]  If the elite continue with the plan, most of us listening now will be killed by neutron releases, as the British Ministry report says.
[00:19:04.702 --> 00:19:06.343]  And controlled bioweapons releases.
[00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:08.404]  So, all of you serving the system laughing.
[00:19:08.424 --> 00:19:09.184]  You're going to be dead.
[00:19:09.604 --> 00:19:12.266]  Alan, how long until they start just the mass extermination?
[00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:15.527]  I know they've got to get the grid in place first so we can't struggle out of it.
[00:19:15.987 --> 00:19:17.848]  How long until the mass extermination begins?
[00:19:18.488 --> 00:19:21.030]  I don't think it'll be much more than a couple of years.
[00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.211]  2010 is a big time.
[00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:29.573]  That's when the last signature for the total integration of the Americas takes place is 2010.
[00:19:31.092 --> 00:19:36.726]  By 2012, they want the United Nations to be raised up to its status as world government.
[00:19:37.878 --> 00:19:43.580]  In charge of the three blocks, trading blocks of the world, which will then become almost like colonies.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.741]  That's what it'll be under the United Nations.
[00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:51.423]  So they must start taking down the population through disease, war, and every other means possible.
[00:19:51.723 --> 00:19:56.304]  This is what they call the hundred years of chaos that they've talked about for centuries and centuries.
[00:19:56.324 --> 00:20:06.828]  It would take a hundred years to take down a civilization, to reduce it, to train the young to come up into the new system as obedient servants who truly believe in it.
[00:20:07.609 --> 00:20:11.312]  And then at the end, they hope to have the technological utopia.
[00:20:11.632 --> 00:20:13.073]  They always talk about utopia.
[00:20:15.655 --> 00:20:16.455]  Continue, Alan.
[00:20:17.276 --> 00:20:19.537]  As I say, you have to go back into the history.
[00:20:19.878 --> 00:20:30.085]  Now, the Fabian Society was a branch of this amalgamation of organizations that were all set up with specialized areas to be active in.
[00:20:30.859 --> 00:20:32.620]  And the Fabian Society, if you read H.G.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.761]  Wells, he was also a founder member of the Fabian Society.
[00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:44.945]  He was also a member of the Public Relations, a PR man for the British Intelligence Organizations that were under royalty.
[00:20:46.186 --> 00:20:50.487]  And the Fabian Society were really deeply into eugenics.
[00:20:51.048 --> 00:20:53.409]  If you read through their writings, they're widely available.
[00:20:54.109 --> 00:20:56.450]  And they're one of the main instruments behind this
[00:20:57.334 --> 00:21:03.919]  Their job was to get the average person, ordinary people, to truly believe in this change and work towards it.
[00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:20.310]  It was almost communistic in its ideology for the workers to believe, but at the top they knew they needed many people from within society, ordinary people, to true believers, in other words, to fall for the big lie of utopia and work willingly towards it.
[00:21:20.911 --> 00:21:22.812]  So they used everyone in turn.
[00:21:23.504 --> 00:21:24.986]  It's the same as the communist system.
[00:21:25.026 --> 00:21:30.995]  They had one set of propaganda for the mass man, one for the bureaucracy, and one for the Politburo.
[00:21:31.055 --> 00:21:32.036]  Different agendas.
[00:21:32.657 --> 00:21:34.480]  This is the same kind of thing that goes on here.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.105]  So all those who fall for we're going to walk into a brief new utopia.
[00:21:38.835 --> 00:21:43.637]  All of us together, and I deserve to be there because I'm special and I've been very good.
[00:21:44.557 --> 00:21:45.798]  That's the big lie.
[00:21:45.898 --> 00:21:47.319]  You will be eradicated one day.
[00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:47.719]  That's right.
[00:21:47.779 --> 00:21:57.383]  Most of the minions of this are like, it's going to be a beautiful utopia, no more work and love, but there'll have to be a lot of, you know, crushing people to get that utopia and then no more wars.
[00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:02.348]  The globalists admit they engineered World War I, World War II to get their League of Nations.
[00:22:02.408 --> 00:22:06.192]  They are the authors of the calamities that they brag about.
[00:22:06.212 --> 00:22:08.035]  They put Mao in, that's now public.
[00:22:08.395 --> 00:22:09.596]  Killed 60 plus million.
[00:22:10.377 --> 00:22:12.900]  And that was all dress rehearsal for this.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.602]  Alan Watt, how do we turn this around?
[00:22:14.662 --> 00:22:16.284]  I mean, I do see people waking up.
[00:22:17.325 --> 00:22:25.348]  But the sheer horror of it, they're only waking up to the state is bad, the government's bad, the elites are bad, that there's corruption.
[00:22:26.248 --> 00:22:35.431]  I don't think, I mean a lot of people just can't deal with the fact that race-specific bioweapons are ready, that the eugenicists run everything, and that they
[00:22:36.391 --> 00:22:43.675]  Well, all these top professors give speeches about killing everybody, and they get standing ovations like Pianca at the Texas Academy of Sciences on the news.
[00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.476]  They're crying, kill everyone!
[00:22:45.496 --> 00:22:46.976]  Yes, oh God, it's so beautiful!
[00:22:46.996 --> 00:22:55.161]  And then you go to Pianca's website, and he's in there saying, I love Lucifer, on the official UT website, in white robes, as a Druid priest.
[00:22:55.201 --> 00:22:59.443]  I mean, it is of Lucifer, and it's out in the open, and they're crying and worshiping,
[00:23:00.243 --> 00:23:02.886]  Yeah, but you're saying a lot of them don't know that they're not going forward.
[00:23:03.146 --> 00:23:09.232]  A lot of these professors, Pianca says, I know me and my family will soon be dead, it's a beautiful, wonderful thing, and I want to go first.
[00:23:09.292 --> 00:23:12.676]  I mean, actually a lot of them are like, yes, I love it, I want to die!
[00:23:12.696 --> 00:23:16.520]  Yeah, well, this is to say, I think it was Elliot who said that
[00:23:17.597 --> 00:23:23.062]  That Lucifer could appear only when you have an atheistic society, and to an extent it's true.
[00:23:23.082 --> 00:23:28.227]  These guys can come out and tell you stuff, and it goes over the heads of people because they don't believe in it themselves.
[00:23:28.788 --> 00:23:31.250]  They think what a quaint hobby to have.
[00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:33.752]  But these guys are dead serious.
[00:23:33.852 --> 00:23:35.254]  Albert Pike talked about it too.
[00:23:35.294 --> 00:23:39.658]  Now, Albert Pike talked about his branch of the society.
[00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:42.009]  Which is called the right of perfection.
[00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:50.016]  So he said that we shall take over the banking industry, basically, through the stock markets and so on.
[00:23:50.036 --> 00:23:53.099]  We shall get to the top by any and every means possible.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:06.231]  And we must remember, around the same era, you had one other branch that took the heat for all the rest of them, and that was Weishaupt's branch, the Bienen order, the order of the beehive.
[00:24:07.017 --> 00:24:09.720]  Uh, who said, said that we shall use everyone.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.603]  We entice people in to work for us through great mysteries.
[00:24:12.923 --> 00:24:16.527]  It's always through a mystery that they attract all the New Ager types in.
[00:24:16.927 --> 00:24:20.230]  Then they use them to work towards an agenda which they do not understand.
[00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:28.779]  But Weishaupt also said that through the creation of big foundations, big foundations, these big ones that run the NGOs and finance them,
[00:24:29.304 --> 00:24:31.566]  We shall direct the course of the world.
[00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:33.727]  That's the same thing that Albert Pike said.
[00:24:33.747 --> 00:24:38.491]  That's the same thing as you find the Fabian Society said.
[00:24:38.851 --> 00:24:48.599]  The big foundations are a parallel government intertwined with the Royal Institute of International Affairs that was set up to bring in world government using the British Empire as a base.
[00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:52.041]  And America to take over the running of the empire.
[00:24:52.081 --> 00:24:54.623]  That was done in the time of Kipling.
[00:24:54.664 --> 00:24:56.105]  He wrote about it quite openly.
[00:24:56.725 --> 00:24:59.767]  And so we're simply living a long-term plan.
[00:24:59.848 --> 00:25:05.232]  And this year, this hundred years we're in now is the last, the final phase, they hope.
[00:25:05.892 --> 00:25:09.015]  Now we have been under attack, as I say, since the 1950s.
[00:25:09.135 --> 00:25:11.757]  The sterility rate has plummeted.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.783]  Most men in the Western world are 75% sterile.
[00:25:17.284 --> 00:25:19.485]  And I've looked at all the documentation on the drugs.
[00:25:19.506 --> 00:25:25.170]  You know, almost all the drugs that are commonly given out for different things to do to men cause sterility.
[00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:29.814]  We know that the plastic in the bottles causes sterility, mainly, again, in men.
[00:25:30.674 --> 00:25:31.855]  This is an intentional thing.
[00:25:31.875 --> 00:25:37.319]  They knew this back in the 1930s when they were testing plastic out with animals and humans.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.061]  And they were still doing it today.
[00:25:40.113 --> 00:25:43.475]  We're seeing that the size of the penis has actually got smaller.
[00:25:43.495 --> 00:25:48.438]  I've got reports on that from top science investigators and institutions.
[00:25:48.878 --> 00:25:51.820]  And so we're seeing biological differences.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.781]  We're being bioengineered to be useless.
[00:25:55.182 --> 00:25:59.544]  Useless in a time when men generally stand up together for the common good.
[00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:01.172]  This is intentional.
[00:26:01.212 --> 00:26:11.700]  So this war has been going on for a long time, very covertly, but very deliberate, and there are no accidents when it comes to these kind of... And we go back to Cecil Rhodes.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.800]  It's all stated.
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.861]  He's given Rhodesia.
[00:26:13.901 --> 00:26:15.843]  He's worth billions of dollars in money then.
[00:26:16.263 --> 00:26:19.545]  He sets up a system to set up covert British Empire operations.
[00:26:19.926 --> 00:26:29.493]  It's all in the history books, but the public says it doesn't exist, while world leaders are all over TV calling for a world government and global governance, and Zeitgeist comes out and calls for global government.
[00:26:29.673 --> 00:26:32.494]  But then if I say I don't want it, now I'm the tyrant.
[00:26:33.074 --> 00:26:44.737]  Yes, and if you go to Huxley's writings, and Huxley said that too at Berkeley, he said there has always been a dominant minority in every era, and he said, I don't see the reason why there shall not be in the future.
[00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:52.279]  Now, these utopias, I think Orwell explained it best, he said, he said some are more equal than others in such utopias.
[00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:55.900]  Stay there, stay there, we're going to talk behind the scenes and come back for everybody else, stay with us.
[00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:01.901]  Alan, continue, and when we come back, let's plug your site and things.
[00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:06.404]  We've got 15 minutes going into the next hour with you, but a lot of breaks coming up.
[00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:10.927]  You know, I think we can turn it around.
[00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:14.669]  We don't have a choice, and certainly things aren't going perfectly for these people.
[00:27:15.229 --> 00:27:23.955]  I've seen a lot of globalists write and say that they've been so effective at dumbing people down that they're having trouble finding even competent henchmen now.
[00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:25.602]  That's correct.
[00:27:25.662 --> 00:27:35.729]  Everyone has been put under very good psychological warfare techniques through television, media, and so on for their whole lives long.
[00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:38.531]  And they get caught in double-think.
[00:27:38.591 --> 00:27:45.135]  They still want to believe the media is telling them the truth, even though the evidence around them in their own lives tells them something different.
[00:27:45.856 --> 00:27:47.537]  So they're caught there.
[00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:51.700]  But the elite have also prepared for the trouble that is to come.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.362]  We've seen them build up internal armies for years now.
[00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:55.572]  That's right!
[00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:13.535]  In the economic atmosphere, people think troops are going to march out and say, Martial Law Day 1.
[00:28:13.835 --> 00:28:13.995]  No.
[00:28:14.216 --> 00:28:18.660]  They've crept up, they've geared up, they've conditioned the local towns and cities with drills to accept it.
[00:28:19.181 --> 00:28:21.403]  They've told the public, the army's standing by to keep you safe.
[00:28:21.704 --> 00:28:28.131]  Then they stage the riots, let them take place, and then that sets the precedence for the public to acquiesce and ask for it.
[00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:32.015]  Yes, and in fact, riots will come out, and I guarantee you that's how they'll do it.
[00:28:32.719 --> 00:28:40.324]  When the government says they can't come up with the funding for welfare and you wait and see, they'll spark it off right away and they know when to do it.
[00:28:40.404 --> 00:28:42.225]  I'm sure they even have a date picked for doing it.
[00:28:45.707 --> 00:28:47.768]  They have done it with total precision.
[00:28:47.788 --> 00:28:50.270]  We're going to come back and I want to get into television sets.
[00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:57.614]  I mean, I know that we talk about the flicker rate and the subliminals and the semantic and all the different layers to this.
[00:28:59.495 --> 00:29:00.356]  But I want to
[00:29:02.342 --> 00:29:03.031]  Just talk about...
[00:29:04.128 --> 00:29:33.460]  What they admit they have, as far as subliminals, and then just what I notice with people watching television, and Alan, the TV, especially with high def TVs, it's especially the high def I have to turn away, it is even mesmerizing myself now, and I've trained myself to be able to not go into a subconscious mode, to not go into the glazed eyes look, to put it simply for the public out there, but now, the combination, especially on Fox, of what I call seven different layers of programming,
[00:29:34.961 --> 00:29:38.385]  I have to actually turn away from it even when I'm monitoring it.
[00:29:39.246 --> 00:29:45.512]  So I want to briefly go through those seven layers and then get your response on it for the balance of the show and talk more about solutions.
[00:29:45.552 --> 00:29:56.663]  But let's plug your website as we go back live right now for the audience who is on the AM and FM dial, satellite and shortwave, not just on the internet as we are now.
[00:29:56.723 --> 00:29:56.964]  Here we go.
[00:30:01.976 --> 00:30:12.400]  Okay, I took RTF for a few years here in Austin and just did the mainline textbooks and just the basic RTF.
[00:30:13.641 --> 00:30:14.081]  It taught.
[00:30:15.399 --> 00:30:20.043]  And they taught and showed us films about in the forties and fifties, the subliminals in movies.
[00:30:20.863 --> 00:30:28.009]  And that's, you know, putting a millisecond, you know, a few frames in there of a desert and then showing an ice cold coke and it doubled sales.
[00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:35.875]  And then there's semantical manipulation where they change the meaning of words and manipulate the way they say things, the way they twist things.
[00:30:36.235 --> 00:30:38.717]  There's that Orwellian, you know, brute type.
[00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:42.740]  Then you have the basic five, six video screens behind the news presenter
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:54.286]  With a buffalo running over somebody, or a car wreck, or a balloon on fire, or a politician speaking, or the running of the bulls in Madrid.
[00:30:54.706 --> 00:31:00.349]  And so your brain can't watch it all consciously, so it switches off into subconscious, and that's admitted.
[00:31:02.526 --> 00:31:04.467]  So we have all the admitted ways they're doing it.
[00:31:04.487 --> 00:31:06.087]  They also have the scroll on the bottom.
[00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:10.648]  So that makes you shift into subconscious mode so your brain can pick all that up.
[00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:11.989]  The brain waves lower.
[00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:13.489]  Then you have the flicker rate.
[00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:16.170]  And again, this is mainline science.
[00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:22.772]  They tune the flicker rate to the exact rate of the brain for hypnotism.
[00:31:22.792 --> 00:31:26.513]  Just like the flashing or strobing light or the watch my watch.
[00:31:27.173 --> 00:31:29.374]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[00:31:30.334 --> 00:31:37.080]  And now, and it's always been happening before it was the authoritative male on the news, now it's Infobabes smacking their lips.
[00:31:37.441 --> 00:31:49.512]  They'll be talking about the most horrible thing, but they're so sincere, and they're looking at you with sexual desire, and you'll be watching with all these layers, and you can't help but start smiling and start liking it.
[00:31:49.652 --> 00:31:52.014]  Even myself, when I'm consciously
[00:31:52.995 --> 00:31:54.176]  Yes, well you'll find that
[00:32:23.126 --> 00:32:26.228]  Techniques have always been used on the public for mind control.
[00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:27.189]  Always.
[00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.812]  Religions and so on were used in centuries gone by.
[00:32:30.832 --> 00:32:35.635]  Always in collusion with the dominant minority of the country to keep them in place.
[00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:41.620]  So when radio came out, Britain, the BBC, sprung up very quickly.
[00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:42.830]  I don't know.
[00:32:59.494 --> 00:33:09.564]  That they could put out dramas, daily dramas to the public and leave you with a cliffhanger, with the hero hanging at the end of it, what's going to happen to you tomorrow.
[00:33:09.944 --> 00:33:13.428]  And people would change their behavior and be there tomorrow at that time.
[00:33:13.828 --> 00:33:16.290]  So it's a technique to alter your behavior.
[00:33:16.831 --> 00:33:18.372]  This was also confirmed by Skinner.
[00:33:19.545 --> 00:33:30.955]  Who talked about technology and so on, and he said that technology, it's real influence is to alter the reality of the people into which it's introduced.
[00:33:31.555 --> 00:33:32.356]  That's what happens.
[00:33:32.396 --> 00:33:35.158]  Look at the people now with their cell phones and iPods and all the rest of it.
[00:33:35.178 --> 00:33:38.802]  Their behavior has been altered by technology itself.
[00:33:39.682 --> 00:33:44.226]  With the high-definition television, it certainly must be more effective than the last type.
[00:33:44.947 --> 00:33:45.667]  The reason you have
[00:33:46.661 --> 00:33:47.541]  I think so.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:07.088]  And someone starts to talk in your ear about some other topic, you say, shh, shh, because you're now getting auditory responses and visual from the two questions.
[00:34:07.208 --> 00:34:09.831]  It's just like when you try to watch a movie with subtitles.
[00:34:10.151 --> 00:34:15.816]  You're distracted away and now subconsciously are absorbing the entire system.
[00:34:15.836 --> 00:34:16.797]  And again, stay there.
[00:34:16.857 --> 00:34:18.759]  Back in one minute, Alan, I want you to walk through these.
[00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:26.663]  But then they have integrated all these together while the message itself is verbally twisting a semantical deception and lie.
[00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:35.767]  But you can't even pay attention to what they're really saying because you're watching a million different pinwheels and subliminal messages and flashes and scrolls and everything else.
[00:34:38.436 --> 00:34:44.599]  Okay, I'm going to stay on air during this segment for folks listening on the local micro and everybody on the internet and everywhere else.
[00:34:45.399 --> 00:34:47.981]  John, I want you to go ahead and call Charlotte Isserby.
[00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:51.362]  Let her know we're going to call her about 12 after or so for 15 after.
[00:34:51.382 --> 00:34:56.745]  So go ahead and get her in the wings so I can go straight through with Alan Watt with the time we have left with him, okay?
[00:34:58.041 --> 00:34:58.201]  Okay.
[00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:15.502]  And Alan, you've got to remind me when we come in next segment, plug your materials, your articles, the great videos and things that are up on the different Cutting Through the Matrix websites because that's invaluable for people to go research more and expand their horizons.
[00:35:15.562 --> 00:35:17.385]  But the bottom line, this is so hellish.
[00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:24.997]  I don't know how any member of the minion elite, the mid-level gophers, why you would go along with this.
[00:35:25.017 --> 00:35:28.918]  You're on these personal power trips, you're cynical, you're elitist, you're full of yourselves.
[00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:33.959]  I think of the BBC news presenter who reported that Building 7 had fallen before it did.
[00:35:34.379 --> 00:35:37.599]  He then lied to the cameras and said, I never worked on 9-11.
[00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:38.400]  You're making that up.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:44.901]  They showed him a video on a laptop and he said, oh yes, now I remember that day and then laughed at them and kind of said, touche, you caught me.
[00:35:46.721 --> 00:35:47.742]  These guys are nothing.
[00:35:47.762 --> 00:35:49.083]  They're drinking sodium fluoride.
[00:35:49.103 --> 00:35:50.363]  Their kids are being given cancer.
[00:35:50.683 --> 00:35:53.425]  But they enjoy that petty feeling of lying.
[00:35:53.445 --> 00:35:55.546]  And it's just sick.
[00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:57.787]  It's delusional because they're not even members of this elite.
[00:35:58.327 --> 00:35:59.568]  But, Alan, I want your comment on that.
[00:35:59.588 --> 00:35:59.928]  Here we go.
[00:35:59.948 --> 00:36:00.468]  Full audience.
[00:36:02.209 --> 00:36:02.849]  Big Brother.
[00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.550]  Mainstream media.
[00:36:05.291 --> 00:36:06.371]  Government cover-ups.
[00:36:07.052 --> 00:36:07.852]  You want answers?
[00:36:08.612 --> 00:36:09.393]  Well, so does he.
[00:36:10.169 --> 00:36:13.791]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:18.454]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36:19.295 --> 00:36:22.597]  Charlotte Izzerbeet is joining us in 15 minutes.
[00:36:22.697 --> 00:36:27.139]  Alan, you were going through just what the simple scroll does, making your mind focus on that.
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.463]  So now you're distracted and the propaganda verbally goes directly into the subconscious.
[00:36:33.483 --> 00:36:34.684]  That's only two layers.
[00:36:35.244 --> 00:36:36.025]  Keep going through that.
[00:36:36.085 --> 00:36:39.407]  I want to talk about the gopher class, why they serve their masters.
[00:36:40.219 --> 00:36:50.505]  Yes, getting back to that part you're talking about there with subliminals, when you're trying to listen, when your eyes and your ears are working in unison,
[00:36:51.027 --> 00:37:10.109]  With the one person talking on TV, you still have the ability to censor or say, I don't quite believe this or whatever, but when you have another element added to it, a second visual, it alters the brain frequencies as you're watching it and your censor part is down, you're taking all that in.
[00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:19.837]  It's much more extreme than just the case of them shrinking attention spans down to about 2 minutes from previously over an hour 50 years ago.
[00:37:20.278 --> 00:37:20.978]  It's more than that.
[00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:25.162]  People now can't just watch a straight up TV program that's just straight up.
[00:37:25.282 --> 00:37:29.666]  They have to have multi-layers because now their neurons and neural pathways have been prepared.
[00:37:30.462 --> 00:37:31.003]  That's correct.
[00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:43.679]  And when you're seeing some horror scrolling around the bottom of the screen, you're hearing another one from the presenter in front of or on the screen, you can only handle two major crises to three, possibly for some people, at once.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.746]  And when you cannot handle that, you literally go into an alpha state and you're now being
[00:37:48.946 --> 00:38:03.419]  And they have the info, babe, showing just incredible sexual desire and all of her body language towards you through the TV screen with the false illusion she's really there with you in the room, while they show you violence and report horrible things, also creating false neural pathways.
[00:38:04.185 --> 00:38:04.826]  That's correct.
[00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:21.437]  And it's well known, even in torture techniques that they use, sexual pictures and so on, as they're torturing the people, often they can create a better breakdown, a faster breakdown in the person, because it brings a different part of the brain into action as well.
[00:38:21.577 --> 00:38:23.758]  Here's an example they admit at Camp X-Ray.
[00:38:24.138 --> 00:38:33.585]  Pouring menstrual fluid, I hate to get gross here, on men while they're raped, while people dance around in Satan outfits, while they electrocute their testicles.
[00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:34.945]  Yes, that's right.
[00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:35.466]  That's right.
[00:38:35.726 --> 00:38:37.146]  That's what we have running the show.
[00:38:37.487 --> 00:38:46.090]  And we better realize that that is the mentality of... These are from the orders of the same boys at the top that talk about this wonderful utopia.
[00:38:47.731 --> 00:38:48.672]  Let's not forget that.
[00:38:49.432 --> 00:38:51.973]  Yeah, by the way, that's what's declassified from X-Ray, folks.
[00:38:52.253 --> 00:38:54.454]  I could say more, but it's too pornographic.
[00:38:54.554 --> 00:38:55.375]  Alan, please continue.
[00:38:55.735 --> 00:38:57.956]  Yeah, so we better realize that
[00:38:59.998 --> 00:39:08.765]  This Brave New World scenario, as I say, the Huxley type, will not come into being until the vast majority of the public have been altered, killed off.
[00:39:09.614 --> 00:39:10.695]  And, or neutered.
[00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:12.996]  And all of that will be to come.
[00:39:13.356 --> 00:39:15.278]  In fact, that will be mandatory eventually.
[00:39:15.458 --> 00:39:19.620]  It's a complete sterilization of people to save the world.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.222]  We're all in it together, all of that kind of thing.
[00:39:22.242 --> 00:39:26.384]  And now all the teen magazines have, you know, the beautiful young model who's the movie star.
[00:39:26.724 --> 00:39:28.225]  She got sterilized, Alan.
[00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.506]  She's cool.
[00:39:29.826 --> 00:39:30.307]  She's cool.
[00:39:30.987 --> 00:39:32.368]  And she's politically correct.
[00:39:32.508 --> 00:39:34.149]  And therefore, she has a past.
[00:39:34.189 --> 00:39:36.170]  She can pass through places that you cannot.
[00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.951]  You're a bad one.
[00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:38.792]  You still think an old think.
[00:39:39.552 --> 00:39:42.955]  And you haven't caught up to the new type yet, so you're obsolete.
[00:39:43.035 --> 00:39:43.735]  That's the message.
[00:39:43.755 --> 00:39:48.238]  You're obsolete if you're not adapted into this brave new world.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.660]  Alan, please continue.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.782]  We're going to skip this break for the InfoWars listeners.
[00:39:53.862 --> 00:39:55.103]  Just don't even give me music, John.
[00:39:55.923 --> 00:39:59.286]  And I should also say, too, that people can get a lot more on my website.
[00:39:59.326 --> 00:40:08.552]  That's CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com, where there's lots of talks and all of this kind of history and what's going on and the foundations and organizations behind it that help bring it in.
[00:40:09.338 --> 00:40:09.619]  Thank you.
[00:40:24.298 --> 00:40:27.079]  And still expect to think for yourself.
[00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:28.219]  And Alan, I'll say this.
[00:40:28.439 --> 00:40:38.641]  Very few, you're one of the people I count among the half a dozen, who really get the closest to the real full picture, which takes a lot of courage to even face.
[00:40:39.161 --> 00:40:41.481]  So many other people aren't even government agents in our movement.
[00:40:41.761 --> 00:40:51.943]  They are fragmented by the organic system they grew up in, so they are giving people defaulty, faulty messages of the true nature of the Matrix.
[00:40:52.823 --> 00:40:57.444]  So most folks that are putting out this info aren't even agents, they're just not getting the full picture.
[00:40:57.604 --> 00:40:58.164]  Can you speak to that?
[00:40:58.204 --> 00:40:58.685]  That's right.
[00:40:58.945 --> 00:41:10.087]  If you've been, if you've swallowed the old system, where you really believe everything was just okay before 9-11, which is another myth, we like to have golden ages, we go back to, that was a myth.
[00:41:10.127 --> 00:41:16.369]  The same boys ran the Great Depression that are running it today, their descendants are running it today.
[00:41:17.129 --> 00:41:22.673]  And they're falsely blaming freedom and capitalism and free market for what's happening when it was never a free market at the higher levels.
[00:41:47.049 --> 00:41:48.089]  It's not set up for them.
[00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:53.892]  Yeah, NAFTA was 14,000 pages, GATT was 20-something thousand, and it was all selective deals.
[00:41:54.632 --> 00:42:00.854]  Selective deals, and we had a bureaucrat in Canada who drafted up all the negotiation books.
[00:42:01.214 --> 00:42:06.276]  In Ottawa, that was Shelley Ann Clark, and she came out on television in Montreal.
[00:42:07.294 --> 00:42:08.995]  Saying that there were two sets of groups.
[00:42:09.115 --> 00:42:11.315]  One that the premiers of Canada were shown.
[00:42:11.336 --> 00:42:13.496]  These are the governors of the provinces.
[00:42:14.196 --> 00:42:18.638]  And the other one was for the real negotiators who did all the business.
[00:42:18.678 --> 00:42:25.180]  And then even when we sue through Foyer's request and get the secret documents, which they admit are the real ones.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.421]  Admitting all this, the public's been conditioned to say no, no, no.
[00:42:30.202 --> 00:42:31.562]  But I see that breaking down.
[00:42:31.923 --> 00:42:35.844]  How is the establishment going to counter the mass awakening I'm certainly witnessing?
[00:42:36.986 --> 00:42:38.426]  Well, this is just it.
[00:42:39.587 --> 00:42:57.411]  They predicted how our reactions would be, because they plan everything with military strategy, including how will the public react to them, and even have different classifications and sections of the public, how would each section... Different flavors of propaganda, sub-flavors, yes.
[00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:58.351]  That's correct.
[00:42:58.931 --> 00:43:04.412]  And they also know that the bulk of the populace is simply confused.
[00:43:04.432 --> 00:43:06.373]  They live in perpetual confusion.
[00:43:07.111 --> 00:43:07.751]  It is a weapon!
[00:43:07.811 --> 00:43:08.332]  It is a weapon!
[00:43:27.841 --> 00:43:34.623]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm fully conscious of it, and I catch myself slipping in to smiling back at the woman on the screen.
[00:43:34.643 --> 00:43:37.103]  I mean, it is sophisticated.
[00:43:37.543 --> 00:43:41.304]  Yes, and I read an article a couple of weeks ago from the U.S.
[00:43:41.384 --> 00:43:47.826]  Army, from one of their magazines, where they talked about using this American culture, which has been weaponized.
[00:43:48.366 --> 00:43:49.706]  They call it weaponized culture.
[00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:53.867]  Now, see, the United States doesn't realize that Hollywood is a branch.
[00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:56.044]  of this organization.
[00:43:57.205 --> 00:43:58.045]  Everything's weaponized.
[00:43:58.065 --> 00:43:59.385]  The food, the water, the media.
[00:43:59.605 --> 00:44:00.966]  And that's why they want to shut down the web.
[00:44:01.006 --> 00:44:01.366]  Here we go.
[00:44:01.446 --> 00:44:02.086]  Final segment.
[00:44:04.507 --> 00:44:04.927]  Media.
[00:44:05.667 --> 00:44:06.747]  Government cover-ups.
[00:44:07.408 --> 00:44:08.228]  You want answers?
[00:44:08.988 --> 00:44:09.868]  Well, so does he.
[00:44:09.948 --> 00:44:14.190]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.811]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:21.352]  The world's financial ministers of the
[00:44:22.412 --> 00:44:24.334]  Top 15 or so industrialized nations.
[00:44:24.394 --> 00:44:25.475]  It's larger than G8.
[00:44:25.956 --> 00:44:28.038]  Our meeting has set up a world banking system.
[00:44:28.058 --> 00:44:30.421]  You'll pay world carbon credits into them.
[00:44:31.102 --> 00:44:33.845]  They're talking about shutting down the world markets next week.
[00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:35.867]  Global financial dictatorship.
[00:44:36.668 --> 00:44:39.731]  That will further depress markets when they reopen them so they can consolidate.
[00:44:40.885 --> 00:44:43.026]  Got about seven minutes left with Alan Watt.
[00:44:43.046 --> 00:44:47.807]  Alan, give out your website again for listeners that want to check it out and all the great material.
[00:44:48.387 --> 00:44:49.908]  It's just a treasure trove of information.
[00:44:49.928 --> 00:44:56.730]  And then in the last seven, eight minutes, other key areas you want to discuss, solutions, ways for people to fully break their conditioning out there.
[00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:57.790]  Yeah.
[00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:02.632]  The website is cuttingthroughthematrix.com and also alanwattcentral.eu.
[00:45:04.105 --> 00:45:12.129]  And you can download lots of talks and transcripts of the shows I've done in the past where I've gone into the histories with available documentation.
[00:45:12.149 --> 00:45:19.513]  I try to stick to the documentation because these characters do write what they plan to do in the future.
[00:45:19.533 --> 00:45:25.897]  And I tell people when you get their books from, say, the Royal Institute or the CFR, which is the same organization, by the way, really,
[00:45:27.836 --> 00:45:28.036]  You're
[00:45:49.887 --> 00:45:53.132]  100 years to complete this 100 years war.
[00:45:53.512 --> 00:45:54.714]  It's not a war on the Middle East.
[00:45:54.754 --> 00:45:56.856]  That's only part of it to standardize the world.
[00:45:57.277 --> 00:46:05.368]  It's a war on all of the humanity, which they claim happens to be the profane, those who live in the darkness, the average person.
[00:46:06.048 --> 00:46:17.873]  And only the elite have the right, they claim, the illumined ones themselves, to run our lives and organize our lives the way it should be scientifically done, with logic, etc., etc.
[00:46:18.174 --> 00:46:21.835]  That's how they literally see their role in ruling us.
[00:46:22.275 --> 00:46:30.759]  We are too stupid to do it ourselves, we're too base, too primitive, and therefore they, being obviously better than we are, have the right to do it.
[00:46:30.779 --> 00:46:32.220]  That's pure Darwinism.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:32.980]  Continuum.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:51.820]  Yes, they do.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.823]  They truly believe they're the most evolved species on the planet.
[00:47:13.147 --> 00:47:20.056]  And that through selective breeding, they have the best intellect and therefore the right to rule the lessers.
[00:47:20.636 --> 00:47:21.377]  That's what they say.
[00:47:22.098 --> 00:47:24.281]  Or the profane, as they generally called it in the past.
[00:47:24.922 --> 00:47:26.063]  And they mean business.
[00:47:26.223 --> 00:47:30.829]  They have society in such a brainwashed condition
[00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:44.017]  That they know they can keep recruiting young, stupid guys into their system that have given them a whole generation of video games and nothing but glorification of the military, the black outfits, etc.
[00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:48.820]  They've destroyed the neural pathways where blood and guts and torture looks beautiful to them?
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:49.661]  Absolutely.
[00:47:49.741 --> 00:47:50.941]  Looks like a field of daisies.
[00:47:51.762 --> 00:47:52.262]  They have.
[00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.123]  They've desensitized them completely.
[00:47:54.724 --> 00:47:58.346]  And in a society too, and every dictator has known this,
[00:47:58.986 --> 00:48:04.068]  When you break the bonding between a family and society, people crave bonding.
[00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:05.568]  Children need bonding.
[00:48:05.588 --> 00:48:09.950]  That's why especially young males are terribly screwed up today.
[00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.390]  They're brought up with single mothers often.
[00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:14.711]  They don't have the male role figure.
[00:48:14.971 --> 00:48:18.773]  The gang leader becomes their best friend who protects them.
[00:48:19.213 --> 00:48:20.413]  Or they go into the military.
[00:48:20.433 --> 00:48:22.614]  The military then takes over that rule.
[00:48:22.654 --> 00:48:24.454]  They belong for the first time in their life.
[00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:25.795]  They're in a new tribe.
[00:48:26.415 --> 00:48:30.657]  And they have total dedication to the fellows, their fraternity of the tribe.
[00:48:31.177 --> 00:48:35.939]  That's the same technique that's been used for a long time, and it does work, unfortunately.
[00:48:36.239 --> 00:48:40.240]  While they're in that brainwashed mode, these guys will do whatever they're told.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:49.984]  So we've got to realize that, that the elite are going to cause incredible turmoil within different countries, and they do want civil wars to break out.
[00:48:50.564 --> 00:48:53.606]  So they can bring out all the repressive force that they've built up.
[00:48:54.026 --> 00:48:57.268]  The Department of Defense of Britain is top think tank.
[00:48:57.548 --> 00:49:04.112]  It's also the top for NATO has come out with with 30 years of riots, ongoing riots.
[00:49:04.172 --> 00:49:05.193]  That's what they perceive.
[00:49:05.948 --> 00:49:08.349]  And that will have the public beg for a police state.
[00:49:08.409 --> 00:49:09.430]  This is the New York Times.
[00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:13.933]  Pint-sized eco-police, punch this up if you can on the TV screen for folks, pint-sized eco-police making parents
[00:49:25.239 --> 00:49:26.920]  Proud and sometimes crazy.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:37.323]  So see, they're proud of it, and it says, sometimes Jennifer Ross feels she cannot make a move at home without inviting some of the scorn of her daughters, 10-year-old Grace and 7-year-old Aliza.
[00:49:39.323 --> 00:49:41.704]  The Acura MDX she drives, a flagrant polluter.
[00:49:42.144 --> 00:49:44.805]  The bath at night to help her relax, a wasteful indulgence.
[00:49:45.405 --> 00:49:48.266]  The reusable shopping bag she forgot, again, tsk tsk.
[00:49:49.363 --> 00:49:50.684]  They call it the First Earth Army.
[00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:18.183]  And this was first announced by the creator of the Star Wars, or Star Trek series, Gene Roddenberry.
[00:50:18.203 --> 00:50:21.044]  And then Delta Force picked it up as the first Earth Battalion.
[00:50:21.444 --> 00:50:31.069]  They say that for Mother Earth they will, and the Special Forces has taught this now, they will slaughter, they are the horse of death and they do these satanic chants.
[00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:32.090]  That's correct.
[00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:35.832]  And so this was, again, Roddenberry announced that he belonged to NASA.
[00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:39.771]  And he was the head of the Crowleyan Society here in the U.S.
[00:50:57.461 --> 00:50:58.362]  Good God help us.
[00:50:59.003 --> 00:51:04.208]  Alan Watt, incredible interview and I want to get you back up next week for a full two hours if you can do it.
[00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:11.875]  We're very thankful to have you here and the reason we can finish each other's sentences, folks, is because we're just going off their own documentation.
[00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:18.562]  If you really talk to the elite, it's what O'Brien torturing Winston, as he's torturing him almost to death, says.
[00:51:18.602 --> 00:51:19.402]  Look, it's about
[00:51:20.904 --> 00:51:27.291]  You look at me, Winston, with black circles around my eyes, and I'm getting old, but my falling apart is the strength of the organism.
[00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.192]  We're going to tear families apart.
[00:51:29.213 --> 00:51:30.674]  We're going to dumb people down to animals.
[00:51:30.694 --> 00:51:32.015]  We're going to then even kill more.
[00:51:32.356 --> 00:51:33.577]  We're going to debase everything.
[00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:37.021]  It is about a wonderland for us to murder, kill, and torture.
[00:51:37.541 --> 00:51:40.606]  And that's the real utopia, is it not, Alan?
[00:51:40.906 --> 00:51:42.188]  That is the real utopia.
[00:51:42.348 --> 00:51:53.045]  Even Russian defectors have come across and said that once totalitarianism comes into their own country, they'll turn, first of all, on the very liberal ideologists,
[00:51:53.525 --> 00:51:59.890]  And professors who help promote it, because they cannot have people demanding freedom as the liberals do.
[00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:08.196]  So the liberals bring it in, they go for all these wonderful causes, but they're the first to be knocked off when they see the reality of the totalitarian system.
[00:52:09.437 --> 00:52:11.259]  Because the elite know that they're going to fight them.
[00:52:11.759 --> 00:52:13.360]  So, there you go.
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:15.041]  Alan Watt, thank you for spending time with us.
[00:52:15.442 --> 00:52:16.402]  It's been a pleasure, Alex.
[00:52:16.563 --> 00:52:19.865]  Amazing interview with the one and only Alan Watt.
[00:52:19.885 --> 00:52:20.846]  Do we have Charlotte Isserby?
[00:52:22.535 --> 00:52:23.796]  All right, cut her a little bit short today.
[00:52:23.817 --> 00:52:27.260]  I apologize, we got Alan on late, but she'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:52:27.661 --> 00:52:34.208]  She's got some breaking news and info for us, but I wanted to get her on because, you know, she was the second in command, Department of Education.
[00:52:34.228 --> 00:52:36.090]  Her dad was Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:39.253]  She was in the fire and service top of her class herself.
[00:52:40.134 --> 00:52:47.077]  She was brought in in the Reagan administration, and they openly said, we're here to brainwash and brain damage basically everybody and prepare them to have the families broken up.
[00:52:47.597 --> 00:52:53.419]  And she's got all the quotes in her book, Deliberate Dumbing Down, by the way, available at InfoWars.com, the size of a phone book.
[00:52:53.979 --> 00:53:05.803]  And so I thought we'd go directly to her to talk about the financial collapse, the tattletales in the schools, the environmental cops, everything that's happening, everything she predicted, because she was there watching all the planning happen.
[00:53:06.103 --> 00:53:07.664]  Charlotte Isserby, good to have you on with us.
[00:53:08.044 --> 00:53:09.065]  Yes, hello Alex.
[00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:12.127]  I got in on the last part of the interview with Alan Watt.
[00:53:13.048 --> 00:53:20.894]  Very, very interesting and I sort of felt like it was what I was asleep dreaming like I usually do about everything that is really happening.
[00:53:20.974 --> 00:53:22.775]  It's not a dream, huh?
[00:53:22.795 --> 00:53:25.577]  But anyway, yes, I'm glad I could be on.
[00:53:25.797 --> 00:53:37.366]  I'm not glad that I'm looking back at all the research that many of us, not just myself, have been doing over the past 30 years and I feel that
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.781]  It's all coming together now.
[00:53:40.842 --> 00:53:43.924]  The economy is collapsing.
[00:53:44.585 --> 00:53:55.553]  The presidential election, no matter who we get, we're going to get something really very bad, both of whom are controlled by the same people.
[00:53:55.613 --> 00:53:56.513]  It will look different.
[00:53:57.694 --> 00:54:05.320]  Each administration will have its differences, but when it comes down to policymaking, they will be identical.
[00:54:06.468 --> 00:54:14.054]  However, having said that, I have... I just... Who to vote for?
[00:54:14.134 --> 00:54:21.199]  It's up to your listeners if they... I went and voted absentee because I'm leaving, getting out of the country for a while.
[00:54:21.219 --> 00:54:29.225]  Sort of like I'm getting out of the country on purpose, because I will be out for probably a period when things are... big things are taking place.
[00:54:29.325 --> 00:54:29.926]  But anyway,
[00:54:31.215 --> 00:54:39.518]  When I went to vote, we live in a little town in Dresden, Maine, and I looked up at the clerk and I said, do you have a Kleenex?
[00:54:39.638 --> 00:54:40.779]  This is after I'd finished.
[00:54:41.139 --> 00:54:43.640]  And she went to get a Kleenex and she was very polite.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.720]  Oh no, I'm just kidding.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:51.903]  I said, I just had to, I need a Kleenex because I held my nose for so long I have to blow it.
[00:54:52.783 --> 00:54:55.804]  And she laughed and she said, you know what?
[00:54:56.044 --> 00:54:57.885]  A lot of people feel the same way you do.
[00:54:58.585 --> 00:55:00.366]  And the thing is, we don't have a choice.
[00:55:02.615 --> 00:55:15.539]  Obama terrifies me because he's very bright, he's very slick, he's very highly trained, he's programmed, he's just too smooth, and he lies.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:18.780]  So does McCain, but Obama really is good at it.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:30.184]  I mean, what's been going on lately in regard to his relationship with the, and he calls himself a communist, heirs out of the University of Illinois who was involved in the
[00:55:30.851 --> 00:55:50.856]  Annenberg Challenge, which is nothing other than the Theodore Sizers Program, Coalition of Schools, but airs very high up, the one who launched, basically launched Obama from his living room, who Obama says he really doesn't know very well, and doesn't know anything about him.
[00:55:51.316 --> 00:55:52.576]  Charlotte, stay there, stay there.
[00:55:52.596 --> 00:55:53.036]  We've got a break.
[00:55:53.056 --> 00:55:57.077]  We'll come back and get into this, and then get more into the overarching economic developments.
[00:55:58.001 --> 00:55:58.582]  I think so.
[00:56:18.925 --> 00:56:19.265]  I'm good.
[00:56:37.722 --> 00:56:40.883]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:56:40.943 --> 00:56:42.244]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:57:07.443 --> 00:57:08.464]  But who is the enemy?
[00:57:08.964 --> 00:57:09.504]  Bin Laden.
[00:57:09.765 --> 00:57:10.745]  This is his M.O.
[00:57:10.765 --> 00:57:12.086]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:57:12.126 --> 00:57:13.787]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:57:14.127 --> 00:57:20.892]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:57:21.292 --> 00:57:21.732]  Some U.S.
[00:57:21.772 --> 00:57:27.436]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:57:28.116 --> 00:57:31.577]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:57:31.597 --> 00:57:41.859]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:57:42.079 --> 00:57:42.819]  Fabled enemies.

[00:58:03.087 --> 00:58:08.010]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:10.372]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[00:58:10.832 --> 00:58:12.913]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[00:58:13.554 --> 00:58:16.196]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.

[00:58:18.477 --> 00:58:21.600]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:24.381]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[01:00:15.219 --> 01:00:16.300]  Charlotte is her beat.
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:22.422]  She headed up the Department of Education, got there to help children and found out it was a giant brainwashing operation.
[01:00:22.983 --> 01:00:23.743]  I mean, state it.
[01:00:26.104 --> 01:00:26.524]  State it.
[01:00:26.544 --> 01:00:29.106]  I mean, everybody knows they're there to dumb you down.
[01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:30.907]  Not the teachers, they're not allowed to teach.
[01:00:31.607 --> 01:00:32.307]  But the system.
[01:00:33.888 --> 01:00:34.968]  They get what they pay for.
[01:00:35.028 --> 01:00:39.571]  But today we're getting into the election, we're getting into the economy.
[01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:41.552]  As you said, everything coming to a head.
[01:00:42.791 --> 01:00:43.551]  All engineered.
[01:00:43.571 --> 01:00:46.433]  Going to give you some financial news coming up at the end of the hour.
[01:00:46.473 --> 01:00:47.894]  Big developments in the stock market.
[01:00:48.274 --> 01:00:51.315]  A call for a world government run by the banks, as we said they would do.
[01:00:51.796 --> 01:00:52.856]  Charlotte, please continue.
[01:00:53.456 --> 01:01:07.924]  Yes, well I think we have to go, aside from Obama and his relationship with heirs, and his lying about it, and the possibility that it's going to be the, that will be the philosophy of education, which is totally communist.
[01:01:08.084 --> 01:01:09.564]  But, it's not that it's new.
[01:01:10.105 --> 01:01:10.505]  It's been
[01:01:11.215 --> 01:01:18.061]  Uh, implemented, you know, ever since 1934, but especially under Ronald Reagan when I was there, they put the system in.
[01:01:18.461 --> 01:01:29.851]  But, uh, Obama, if he gets in, and probably McCain too, Obama will institutionalize this, uh, dictatorial system that has no upward mobility for your children.
[01:01:30.171 --> 01:01:37.397]  Your children will only be, uh, allowed to go as far as the government wants them to go in whatever job they want them to go in.
[01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:42.428]  This has been pointed out, not just by myself, but Australian educators.
[01:01:42.488 --> 01:01:59.111]  We have the same outcomes-based education system that is performance-based, what you can do for the state, for the corporate sector, the international corporate greed people, what your child can do for them, rather than his own upward mobility.
[01:01:59.931 --> 01:02:06.612]  This is what has been implemented through the years, now being institutionalized under either McCain or Obama.
[01:02:07.403 --> 01:02:16.942]  Uh, McCain, most likely, his Secretary of Education could well be someone like Theodore Sizer out of Brown University who actually was the designer
[01:02:17.688 --> 01:02:21.031]  Of the Annenberg Challenge, which people could look up on the internet.
[01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:25.133]  Which, of course, Obama's been deeply involved with running one of the chairmanships.
[01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:33.840]  But the point here is, for those that are kind of inside baseball here, the key to a planned economy is the state basically tests you and then says what you're going to be.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:39.624]  And because they're fully blowing out the economy, even private corporations are going to be government-funded in the future.
[01:02:41.145 --> 01:02:44.247]  They can force you to take the job they want you to take.
[01:02:44.307 --> 01:02:45.088]  So, total control.
[01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:47.070]  Absolutely, and it's very scary now.
[01:02:47.150 --> 01:03:03.289]  I mean, I used to talk about corporate fascism, which came in under Reagan, with the public and private sectors in partnership with no accountability to the citizens, but now what we're really looking at is a form of communism, because with the government actually taking over,
[01:03:03.809 --> 01:03:04.730]  The private sector.
[01:03:05.090 --> 01:03:07.952]  Things have moved very fast the last two weeks.
[01:03:07.972 --> 01:03:09.153]  We have to hold on.
[01:03:09.393 --> 01:03:12.235]  There are ways to go back.
[01:03:12.295 --> 01:03:13.676]  There always are ways to cure.
[01:03:13.696 --> 01:03:21.082]  Well, people always get confused when we read Carol Quigley and all these world leaders, the top experts saying the big banks funded communism.
[01:03:21.562 --> 01:03:23.143]  Because the people never get it.
[01:03:23.163 --> 01:03:29.148]  The elite comes in, makes the state grab all the middle class wealth, then they hand it to the bankers.
[01:03:30.629 --> 01:03:31.910]  So that's what's happening right now.
[01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:43.739]  Yes, and then, of course, the Tax Exempt Foundations, and I want to point out to people who are your listeners, please go to AmericanDeception.com and read the transcript of 3,000 pages of the
[01:03:47.039 --> 01:03:53.543]  The hearings, the Tax Exempt Foundation hearings in 1953, Norman Dodd was the research director.
[01:03:53.603 --> 01:03:57.265]  Go there, you can read anything there, I believe it's a free download.
[01:03:57.285 --> 01:04:00.427]  That's right, that was not in the public domain until you went and paid for it.
[01:04:00.927 --> 01:04:08.051]  Dodd, of course, testified and pieces of it were out, but you went and put it all on your site, where it's admitted in the fifties, this planned economy.
[01:04:08.692 --> 01:04:10.733]  Oh, absolutely, and actually in 1970,
[01:04:12.913 --> 01:04:27.885]  Roy Ashe, with the White House Conference on Future Economy or something in the 70s, he later on in California made a speech and he predicted that in the 90s the communist countries would be working with the capitalist ones.
[01:04:28.045 --> 01:04:35.751]  And it was very interesting because what he said then proved that they have known all along and that the fall of communism was a phony sham.
[01:04:36.252 --> 01:04:41.476]  And what we're looking at now, basically, folks, is implementing the international socialist system, which was
[01:04:41.969 --> 01:04:44.430]  Nothing other than what Lennon called for.
[01:04:45.291 --> 01:04:48.653]  But again, it's not socialist in the way we think.
[01:04:49.293 --> 01:05:00.239]  Look at Obama telling McCain, and I can't believe I'm actually for McCain on this, if we're going to have socialism, McCain says we're going to reduce the mortgages to what they're really worth and let the people pay payments if they want to stay in them.
[01:05:00.759 --> 01:05:07.502]  Instead, Obama comes out and says, no, we're going to take your houses, but then just give all the money to the banks.
[01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:17.075]  Well, Obama's expert, his advisor is Brzezinski, and McCain's is Kissinger, aren't we?
[01:05:17.115 --> 01:05:17.995]  We are so lucky.
[01:05:18.075 --> 01:05:27.799]  But Brzezinski and Soros, and anybody who thinks that Obama, because of his skin color, is going to care about the minorities, has got to have their head examined.
[01:05:27.899 --> 01:05:28.299]  No, no, no.
[01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:31.580]  They can abuse the minorities, which are the majority now, more.
[01:05:32.781 --> 01:05:33.741]  Stay there, Charlotte.
[01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:34.461]  Stay there.
[01:05:34.481 --> 01:05:35.002]  We're going to come back.
[01:05:35.062 --> 01:05:35.842]  Long segment coming up.
[01:05:35.862 --> 01:05:37.284]  Plenty of time for you to break this down.
[01:05:37.584 --> 01:05:40.566]  They need him as their cover to do all of this.
[01:05:40.606 --> 01:05:41.227]  That much is clear.
[01:05:41.247 --> 01:05:47.112]  Plus he has all this fascist-type grassroots support, which the New World Order really needs right now to rally around the state.
[01:05:48.313 --> 01:05:49.194]  We're on the march.
[01:05:49.694 --> 01:05:51.295]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:05:52.236 --> 01:05:54.979]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:58.562 --> 01:06:02.365]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?
[01:06:02.912 --> 01:06:04.953]  Then keep listening for a very special offer.
[01:06:05.414 --> 01:06:10.758]  GasFreedom.info has the information you need to learn about the newest hydrogen technology available.

[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:19.184]  It uses electricity from your car's battery to separate water into a gas called HHO.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:24.902]  HHO, also called Browns Gas, burns efficiently and provides the energy your car needs.
[01:06:25.342 --> 01:06:28.283]  In just 10 minutes, you'll discover exactly how this is possible.
[01:06:28.683 --> 01:06:30.844]  This is the secret the oil companies don't want you to know.
[01:06:31.264 --> 01:06:37.527]  Learn how easy it is to extract energy from water to run your car, and experience the most powerful hydrogen cells available.
[01:06:38.087 --> 01:06:42.070]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:07:05.947 --> 01:07:06.968]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:07:07.209 --> 01:07:13.617]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:07:14.258 --> 01:07:22.770]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:29.946]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:33.289]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:07:33.409 --> 01:07:38.614]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:07:39.174 --> 01:07:41.817]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:07:42.257 --> 01:07:49.484]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[01:07:54.225 --> 01:08:13.321]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:20.947]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days, folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food.
[01:08:21.027 --> 01:08:28.676]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how and they didn't have the chickens and the livestock.
[01:08:28.796 --> 01:08:30.037]  So it's a lot different for them.
[01:08:30.157 --> 01:08:32.020]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.884]  We're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage.
[01:08:36.004 --> 01:08:37.145]  Now what can you do to prepare?
[01:08:37.165 --> 01:08:37.965]  Do what I did.
[01:08:38.165 --> 01:08:39.626]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[01:08:39.726 --> 01:08:42.407]  Go to the J. Michael Stephens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[01:08:42.527 --> 01:08:44.328]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.

[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:08.564]  I don't know how that song got in my lineup, but I really want it to go bye-bye.
[01:09:08.584 --> 01:09:10.546]  It tortures me.
[01:09:10.626 --> 01:09:15.350]  I'm not bashing whoever it is, but... It's torture.
[01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:20.411]  Charlotte Izzybee is our guest.
[01:09:20.431 --> 01:09:23.113]  We'll give you her website and some of the books and materials she's put out.
[01:09:23.674 --> 01:09:24.714]  Vital information.
[01:09:24.795 --> 01:09:26.996]  She headed up the Department of Education, number two there.
[01:09:27.757 --> 01:09:30.159]  She was the head of policy, which actually ran things.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.601]  Coming up, it is official from Bloomberg.
[01:09:33.642 --> 01:09:34.742]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:45.772]  They are calling for a world banking body, a new empowered organization that's going to be born this weekend.
[01:09:45.812 --> 01:09:46.653]  It's already always been around.
[01:09:46.693 --> 01:09:48.254]  It's the Global Banking Cartel.
[01:09:48.654 --> 01:09:58.161]  With governmental power, Italian Prime Minister said political leaders are discussing the idea of closing the world's financial markets while they rewrite the rules of international finance.
[01:09:58.181 --> 01:09:59.022]  Let me just cover this now.
[01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:04.406]  The idea of suspending the markets for the time it takes to rewrite the rules is being discussed.
[01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.909]  Of course, that'll be even more power for them.
[01:10:07.029 --> 01:10:13.875]  As a cabinet meeting in Naples, Italy, a solution to the financial crisis can't just be for one country or even just for Europe, but global.
[01:10:14.736 --> 01:10:20.020]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 8.1% in early trading and paired most of those losses.
[01:10:20.241 --> 01:10:21.742]  After the remarks, the Dow was down 0.5 to 8,540.
[01:10:25.413 --> 01:10:34.877]  A group of seven financial ministers and central banks are meeting in Washington today and will stay in town for International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings this weekend.
[01:10:35.818 --> 01:10:42.501]  European Union leaders will gather in Paris October 12, three days before the scheduled summit in Brussels, Berlusconi said.
[01:10:42.521 --> 01:10:46.023]  And a group of eight leaders will hold the meeting on the crisis in coming days.
[01:10:46.663 --> 01:10:48.364]  And then they say it'll be like a new Bretton Woods.
[01:10:48.404 --> 01:10:50.425]  And then others are calling for a new world order.
[01:10:51.525 --> 01:10:52.886]  Charlotte Isserby, please continue.
[01:10:53.621 --> 01:10:57.344]  Well, I'm going to be going over there, Alex, just around that time.
[01:10:57.424 --> 01:10:58.725]  I hope they'll let me off the plane.
[01:10:58.805 --> 01:11:08.251]  But anyway, it is happening, and I hoped I would be long gone before it happened.
[01:11:09.372 --> 01:11:10.573]  It may take a while.
[01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:12.634]  There can always be miracles.
[01:11:13.154 --> 01:11:17.697]  But everything that both of us have been at it, we're still alive for 30 or 40 years.
[01:11:17.737 --> 01:11:18.718]  We've documented it.
[01:11:18.758 --> 01:11:19.979]  We've tried to tell people.
[01:11:20.498 --> 01:11:27.582]  But Satan is out there, and he's very, very busy, and he closes the eyes of those who don't want to know.
[01:11:28.222 --> 01:11:35.646]  And no matter who we elect, certainly to the White House, is going to be very instrumental in carrying out this agenda.
[01:11:35.686 --> 01:11:41.830]  I don't care who it is, even if I didn't know the names, we would know that these people had been carefully selected.
[01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:49.334]  The education system was the vehicle by which they brainwashed and dumbed down the American people so that they would
[01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:50.224]  We're good to go.
[01:12:07.777 --> 01:12:24.268]  And all of this has been destroyed thanks to the billions and billions and trillions of dollars that we have given to the socialist educators whose whole goal was nothing other than to create a zombie society, which is exactly what we're looking at right now.
[01:12:24.628 --> 01:12:26.069]  I mean, take a look at Obama.
[01:12:26.449 --> 01:12:30.752]  He really looks like a Manchurian candidate, actually, and I would like to know who his
[01:12:31.596 --> 01:12:32.897]  Who is programming him?
[01:12:32.977 --> 01:12:34.358]  Who are his handlers?
[01:12:34.478 --> 01:12:35.058]  Do you know?
[01:12:35.178 --> 01:12:36.499]  Well, what about McCain?
[01:12:36.599 --> 01:12:37.839]  Yeah, it's Wazinski and others.
[01:12:37.879 --> 01:12:40.241]  What about McCain coming out and saying, fellow prisoners?
[01:12:40.721 --> 01:12:42.782]  Well, yes.
[01:12:42.842 --> 01:12:46.324]  I mean, that's really what we are here in this escape from the U.S.
[01:12:46.364 --> 01:12:46.584]  thing.
[01:12:47.224 --> 01:12:52.587]  By the way, the stock market's only 85 points from going into the 7,000 territory.
[01:12:52.907 --> 01:12:54.348]  It's down about 500 points, 494 on the day so far.
[01:12:58.370 --> 01:13:00.332]  And they engineered all of this.
[01:13:00.352 --> 01:13:01.373]  We told them exactly.
[01:13:01.413 --> 01:13:02.654]  It's in all the government documents.
[01:13:03.095 --> 01:13:03.756]  They're doing this.
[01:13:04.236 --> 01:13:09.521]  I'm sure you know that Henry Paulson has appointed his minion to hand out the $5 trillion.
[01:13:09.581 --> 01:13:10.582]  It's not $851 billion.
[01:13:10.982 --> 01:13:15.687]  And now they're announcing they're going to pay money directly into their own accounts.
[01:13:16.155 --> 01:13:20.259]  Well, you know, they always have to create... Well, there is nothing.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.541]  I've mentioned this before.
[01:13:21.581 --> 01:13:35.375]  When I've been speaking across the country, I always say, anybody who can prove to me that very serious crises or changes that take place, problems in our country, have not been deliberately created, I'll give you a thousand dollars.
[01:13:35.859 --> 01:13:42.241]  And I've never had anybody... Well, we know they've... I mean, you were at the Department of Education, where it was all about a dumb everybody down, and you couldn't believe it.
[01:13:42.621 --> 01:13:44.021]  I mean, you know, you've got all the documents.
[01:13:44.081 --> 01:13:45.441]  It's in your book, Deliberate Dumbing Down.
[01:13:45.501 --> 01:13:49.502]  It's in thousands of quotes of them saying, eradicate the family, destroy the family.
[01:13:50.463 --> 01:13:51.083]  Absolutely.
[01:13:51.203 --> 01:13:54.824]  And they really, when you look at the American people now, they're pathetic.
[01:13:55.344 --> 01:14:00.965]  They're good people, but they don't... they haven't got a clue as to what has gone on.
[01:14:01.385 --> 01:14:04.086]  And if you try to talk to them, they really do resist.
[01:14:04.713 --> 01:14:15.437]  But I think that, you know, Alex, there is one thing that bothers me a bit, and that is that when you look at the local level, wherever you live, I believe it.
[01:14:15.597 --> 01:14:16.197]  I live in Maine.
[01:14:16.217 --> 01:14:19.859]  We have a very bad economy here, but our banks are still strong.
[01:14:20.769 --> 01:14:22.171]  And they're still making loans.
[01:14:22.371 --> 01:14:22.751]  That's right.
[01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:24.873]  This is a war against the real economy.
[01:14:24.913 --> 01:14:26.815]  That's come out with the big banks.
[01:14:26.836 --> 01:14:30.720]  The media is hyping this up, creating fear.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.464]  As Goebbels said, if you can create fear, you can get anything you want.
[01:14:35.925 --> 01:14:38.528]  And I don't believe that the situation
[01:14:39.268 --> 01:14:45.893]  Uh, if it had been left alone and not pulling all these big players into it, the situation could have been taken care of.
[01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:49.215]  But they did it the wrong way because they wanted to do it the wrong way.
[01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:56.020]  These are the same people that gave us NAFTA, who robbed us of our industry, and we're meant to believe that they care about the American people?
[01:14:56.741 --> 01:15:06.684]  You know, so, but as far as the local level and all our people, I think we ought to try to hold firm and don't get too excited out there because go to your local bank.
[01:15:06.744 --> 01:15:09.204]  If you've got a little bit of money, try to help the economy.
[01:15:10.165 --> 01:15:11.045]  Put it back in there.
[01:15:11.065 --> 01:15:13.265]  75%, I believe, of American businesses are
[01:15:15.882 --> 01:15:17.143]  Our local businesses.
[01:15:17.343 --> 01:15:18.163]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:15:18.203 --> 01:15:19.384]  How many people know that?
[01:15:19.824 --> 01:15:28.149]  The 25% of these rotten traders, these corporate fascist international bankers and all, who hate America.
[01:15:28.770 --> 01:15:34.973]  So, we've got to start thinking in terms of the 75% of our small businesses that love America.
[01:15:35.494 --> 01:15:39.376]  And the banks that are going to try to keep you going, folks.
[01:15:39.816 --> 01:15:42.638]  Let's not let ourselves get too, too depressed.
[01:15:45.151 --> 01:15:46.072]  Charlotte, continue.
[01:15:46.732 --> 01:15:49.675]  Well, I just want people to understand that.
[01:15:50.115 --> 01:15:51.216]  And, of course, pray.
[01:15:51.737 --> 01:16:05.588]  Pray to the good Lord that He will bless those good things that used to be part of our fabric in this country and which made the rest of the world wealthy and happy as well.
[01:16:06.309 --> 01:16:12.414]  We can't let the small percentage of evil people drag not only us
[01:16:12.799 --> 01:16:14.060]  But the whole world down.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:17.502]  There's still a lot of good going on in our country.
[01:16:18.022 --> 01:16:19.683]  Even with the dumbed-down masses.
[01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:21.384]  Look what they did two weeks ago.
[01:16:22.065 --> 01:16:24.226]  Excuse me, in quotes, dumbed-down masses.
[01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:25.967]  They understood.
[01:16:25.987 --> 01:16:28.148]  They smelt one big rat.
[01:16:29.009 --> 01:16:30.910]  And they did not go for that bailout.
[01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:32.571]  Now isn't that interesting?
[01:16:34.565 --> 01:16:41.534]  Well, Charlotte, how incredible is it, I'm sure you know about this, that members of Congress were threatened last Friday with martial law.
[01:16:42.855 --> 01:16:44.898]  That they'd be removed if they didn't vote for this.
[01:16:45.299 --> 01:16:46.560]  The executive can't do that.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.541]  That's high treason.
[01:16:47.882 --> 01:16:52.007]  And even myself, I'm so used to reporting this and so aware of what's really going on.
[01:16:52.870 --> 01:17:01.937]  That this is just normal for me because I've been seeing them gear up for it, but the general public still doesn't even know that it wasn't just their will or what was constitutional that was said no.
[01:17:02.537 --> 01:17:07.041]  Henry Paulson is in CNBC today and says, guess what?
[01:17:07.221 --> 01:17:09.222]  We are now just going to give all the money to ourselves.
[01:17:10.103 --> 01:17:13.786]  And then they've got nothing but Goldman Sachs people running the bailout.
[01:17:15.218 --> 01:17:17.740]  Where they own it, giving the money to themselves.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:21.703]  I mean, it's criminal off the charts.
[01:17:22.563 --> 01:17:23.424]  That's what upsets me.
[01:17:23.444 --> 01:17:25.145]  I don't want to say scares me, Charlotte.
[01:17:25.425 --> 01:17:27.447]  Charlotte, they're going for broke.
[01:17:27.847 --> 01:17:28.607]  They don't care.
[01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:31.709]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if... I hate to be gross, you're a woman, or be crude.
[01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:37.533]  I mean, this is like Bush going to the bathroom on the White House lawn like a dog in front of everyone.
[01:17:37.573 --> 01:17:41.036]  I mean, this is just... It is so off the chart!
[01:17:42.099 --> 01:17:46.941]  Well, yes it is, but I think the one good thing is that, Alex, you've been in this for a long time.
[01:17:47.441 --> 01:17:51.303]  I think for the first time, Americans really understand that it's off the chart.
[01:17:51.964 --> 01:17:54.025]  And but, you know, understanding isn't enough.
[01:17:54.405 --> 01:17:55.665]  We have to do something.
[01:17:55.705 --> 01:17:57.546]  We have to know where it came from.
[01:17:57.706 --> 01:18:02.769]  And first of all, you have to understand that both parties are identical.
[01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:04.529]  They may act differently.
[01:18:04.589 --> 01:18:05.890]  They may say things differently.
[01:18:06.758 --> 01:18:09.939]  Look, it's like a blue and a red Chevy Mustang 2008.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:14.480]  It's the same car, just a different paint job.
[01:18:15.001 --> 01:18:21.363]  Exactly, and no matter who we get in the White House, we're going to have the same continued policies.
[01:18:21.403 --> 01:18:28.505]  You've got a blue-skinned, see-through, translucent Mustang, and you've got a chestnut Mustang.
[01:18:29.265 --> 01:18:30.266]  It's still a Mustang!
[01:18:30.546 --> 01:18:31.366]  You're absolutely right!
[01:18:31.646 --> 01:18:51.774]  And you know, Alex, what Americans, certainly so-called old-fashioned conservatives, don't want to face is the fact that, truly, these major changes in our economy, bringing us first to corporate fascism, and that started in the early 20th century, but the major implementation of these things took place under Republican presidents.
[01:18:51.974 --> 01:18:55.375]  Eisenhower was the first one to sign the agreements with the Soviet Union.
[01:18:56.036 --> 01:19:02.685]  At the peak of the Cold War, in every area of endeavor, education... Same thing with Nixon, same thing... That's right!
[01:19:02.725 --> 01:19:10.636]  And then Reagan, the first serious, really, we had agreements in education before, but Reagan was the first one to sign the really major agreement
[01:19:11.136 --> 01:19:15.437]  And then Bush signed us back on to UNESCO four years ago.
[01:19:15.937 --> 01:19:16.817]  That's right.
[01:19:16.857 --> 01:19:18.298]  Where the UN runs our teaching.
[01:19:18.538 --> 01:19:19.298]  Well, you were there.
[01:19:19.358 --> 01:19:21.039]  You were running the Department of Education.
[01:19:21.059 --> 01:19:22.379]  Not running it.
[01:19:22.499 --> 01:19:25.660]  I was senior policy advisor in the research arm.
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.600]  Describe what you saw when you were there.
[01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.941]  Well, I was so shocked.
[01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:38.243]  I saw all your tax money going all over the world, to Moscow, to Germany, to the South Pacific, everywhere, to change this.
[01:19:39.013 --> 01:19:48.040]  The system turned upside down from a knowledge-based system to a performance-based system, which also required total changing of children's values.
[01:19:48.433 --> 01:19:57.820]  Getting rid of any family influence, because the family doesn't want their children to be absolute slaves to the corporate sector, the international corporate sector.
[01:19:58.121 --> 01:20:03.304]  So they had to get rid of the family, they had to change all the values, and they had to totally change the education system.
[01:20:03.725 --> 01:20:15.494]  And that actually happened mostly through George Bush Sr., with the New American School Development Corporation, and one of those programs was Theodore Sizer, Brown University,
[01:20:15.962 --> 01:20:27.405]  Coalition for Essential Schools, which is the Annenberg Charter challenge, which Obama served on the board as number one, I think, with Bill Ayers.
[01:20:27.486 --> 01:20:35.588]  So what I'm trying to say here is, look, there ain't no difference between the two political parties, whether you're talking education, defense,
[01:20:36.047 --> 01:20:42.196]  Foreign policy, sustainable development, the economy, no matter what, they are the same.
[01:20:42.216 --> 01:20:46.603]  Well look at how we've suddenly seen all these Republican leaders come out for global carbon taxes.
[01:20:47.119 --> 01:20:47.559]  I know!
[01:20:47.719 --> 01:20:48.040]  I know!
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:50.141]  I mean, well, you know, it's fine.
[01:20:50.421 --> 01:20:52.643]  Meanwhile, it's admitted it's all a fraud.
[01:20:52.923 --> 01:20:54.144]  The sun just cooled off.
[01:20:54.204 --> 01:20:55.225]  It was hotter than ever.
[01:20:55.245 --> 01:21:00.028]  It was putting off more radiation than ever, so the moons of, you know, the different planets were melting.
[01:21:00.108 --> 01:21:01.849]  The ice caps of Mars were melting.
[01:21:02.389 --> 01:21:11.456]  And, you know, I got the Heather Leiberg concert on, Lord Rothschild, and he just said, nope, Mars doesn't have ice caps.
[01:21:12.516 --> 01:21:16.840]  Uh, and uh, I think we were, uh, we are Change interviewed Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:17.500]  He said, nope.
[01:21:18.181 --> 01:21:19.602]  Uh, Mars doesn't have ice caps.
[01:21:20.262 --> 01:21:21.743]  And they know that it has ice caps.
[01:21:22.184 --> 01:21:26.187]  Uh, you know, they know those were melting and they know now the sun's cooled off and we're going into cooling.
[01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:28.268]  And they know it's all bull.
[01:21:29.109 --> 01:21:31.691]  Well, if you're not going into cooling, I tell you, it's uh,
[01:21:32.786 --> 01:21:37.589]  But on the other hand, how do you like the fact that oil is half the price it was three weeks ago?
[01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:46.915]  Well, that's because we have a depression in real markets with a hyperinflation of currencies, and so that's going to continue to fall until next summer.
[01:21:47.516 --> 01:21:48.056]  Until next summer?
[01:21:48.076 --> 01:21:54.020]  Well, that's great, because living in Maine, you don't have to worry about it down there, but living in Maine, it was pretty expensive last year.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.641]  Well, look how we're conditioned.
[01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:56.181]  We think three...
[01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:01.949]  You're selling my book, and that's just great.
[01:22:02.009 --> 01:22:03.950]  I hope everybody will please get the book.
[01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:07.252]  You can also read it on the internet, but who wants to read 700 pages?
[01:22:07.772 --> 01:22:10.454]  But, because it's all there, folks.
[01:22:10.674 --> 01:22:17.278]  Our country was basically taken, smart, to a change in our education system.
[01:22:17.518 --> 01:22:20.259]  Not guns, not bombs, no.
[01:22:20.439 --> 01:22:21.240]  Change agents.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.320]  Change agents.
[01:22:22.841 --> 01:22:27.363]  Change agents changed education starting in the early part of the century.
[01:22:27.768 --> 01:22:29.670]  Carnegie Corporation was the first one.
[01:22:29.971 --> 01:22:43.767]  Their little book that I have, Conclusions and Recommendations for the Social Studies, it says right in there that the schools have to be changed for a socialist society, and we're going to have to put up with it right in 1934!
[01:22:45.157 --> 01:22:48.518]  And from that time on, Carnegie moved on with Rockefeller and Ford.
[01:22:48.558 --> 01:22:49.438]  And let's explain.
[01:22:50.219 --> 01:22:56.681]  The National Banking Association a hundred years ago said, Americans are too smart, we've got to buy up education, we've got to dumb them down.
[01:22:57.101 --> 01:22:59.262]  Oh, you know, I mean, it's absolutely true.
[01:22:59.622 --> 01:23:03.523]  But the worst part, and I think the break came when I was going to discuss this,
[01:23:04.467 --> 01:23:06.328]  If they have always used the minorities.
[01:23:06.928 --> 01:23:09.728]  And even Obama will use the minorities.
[01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:10.869]  Why say even?
[01:23:10.909 --> 01:23:11.929]  He's just along with them.
[01:23:11.969 --> 01:23:13.769]  He really doesn't represent them at all.
[01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:23.851]  But they started with the minorities, Rockefeller, way, way back, with the Gates Commission, all that stuff in the early 1900s, experimenting on them.
[01:23:24.272 --> 01:23:27.592]  We don't need any doctors and lawyers and all this stuff.
[01:23:27.692 --> 01:23:29.693]  We just want people who will work for us, basically.
[01:23:29.733 --> 01:23:30.813]  That quote is in my book.
[01:23:31.314 --> 01:23:37.919]  But, as we went on, the key document that I actually emailed you about was the Chicago Mastery Learning in 1968.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:49.947]  And that was outcomes-based education, the beginning of the use of the Skinner-Pavlov conditioning method, where you really do no thinking.
[01:23:50.867 --> 01:23:51.988]  It's all conditioning.
[01:23:52.509 --> 01:23:57.152]  And that was a total failure with half of the inner-city kids in Chicago.
[01:23:57.768 --> 01:24:04.075]  And it was even referred to in the professional journal, Education Week, as a human tragedy.
[01:24:04.455 --> 01:24:10.562]  Well, what happened there after they dropped out, God knows where they are now, they did not change a thing.
[01:24:10.842 --> 01:24:18.230]  They just moved on in Chicago with one innovation after the other, the kids going down the tube,
[01:24:18.712 --> 01:24:22.316]  Crime increasing, bringing generals on board to run the schools.
[01:24:22.596 --> 01:24:32.106]  And now, Alex, they're creating two or three separate schools there for homosexual kids and kids who don't know what their identity is, in case people don't know.
[01:24:32.126 --> 01:24:32.426]  That's right.
[01:24:32.466 --> 01:24:37.752]  The design is to destroy any moorings, destroy the family, have everybody fall apart.
[01:24:38.252 --> 01:24:53.902]  So then, the breakdown spreads, the governor announces we're going to use National Guard to confiscate guns statewide, they bring generals in around the schools, the children are now prisoners, the scared public goes along with it, a masterstroke.
[01:24:54.862 --> 01:25:02.587]  It is, and it can only be through, I do say, I've been around a long time, this is satanic.
[01:25:03.252 --> 01:25:06.634]  And, as you know, I wrote that article, and I hope people will read it.
[01:25:06.674 --> 01:25:09.335]  It's on at DeliberateDumbingDown.com.
[01:25:09.695 --> 01:25:16.998]  And I consider it probably my best, because it explains how this happened to Americans, how they fell for this over a period of a hundred years.
[01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:20.760]  It's called, The Devil's Seven Pronged Fork.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:26.223]  You can also just type that into Google, The Devil's Seven Pronged Fork.
[01:25:26.363 --> 01:25:29.024]  It explains how they, in quotes,
[01:25:30.241 --> 01:25:42.328]  Use the dialectic, create the problem, people scream and pose the solution, gradualism, the fog and the cold water, the Federal Reserve, all the money you need, somatic deception, oh well, right?
[01:25:42.428 --> 01:25:47.111]  George Bush's mental health initiative, he calls it the Freedom Initiative.
[01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:58.677]  So anyway, these are the prongs of the devil's fork, and nobody, I don't care how brilliant they are, could have come up with this
[01:25:59.275 --> 01:26:00.356]  I don't think so.
[01:26:20.058 --> 01:26:27.020]  uh... where if something is coming from and I've been doing research for about forty years and I've seen it, I've been, I've lived it, I've lived all over the world.
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:30.321]  Now I understand it's like John on the Isle of Patmos marveling at the beast.
[01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:32.401]  The precision, the crafting.
[01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:38.202]  I wish I were like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, although maybe I don't want to go to Damascus today, but, but anyway.
[01:26:38.222 --> 01:26:39.683]  Well stay there, stay there Charlotte.
[01:26:39.703 --> 01:26:40.943]  Final segment, we're going to come back.
[01:26:41.383 --> 01:26:42.383]  I'll skip this segment.
[01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:48.285]  I'll skip this break for the InfoWars listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers because I want you to have plenty of time to cover this, but, but, but
[01:26:49.285 --> 01:26:49.966]  It really is.
[01:26:49.986 --> 01:26:51.767]  I guess the Bible calls it the mystery of evil.
[01:26:52.008 --> 01:26:57.633]  It's all in documents they're doing it, but the precision, the precision.
[01:26:57.993 --> 01:26:58.854]  Alex Jones here.
[01:26:59.394 --> 01:27:03.037]  Okay, Charlotte, keep talking about that because this is important.
[01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:07.081]  Even though I consciously know what they're doing and I read their own documents where they admit it,
[01:27:07.561 --> 01:27:13.686]  It still is incredible to see it being implemented, because then you know all the rest of their plans are going to be implemented.
[01:27:13.706 --> 01:27:23.593]  I mean, everything they say they're going to do, they implement, and up here it's mass murdering 90% of us very soon, and I'm like, God, I don't think people understand this is really going to happen!
[01:27:24.954 --> 01:27:30.178]  Well, they better get with it, and then they'll be happy if they pass away, you know, a little early.
[01:27:32.366 --> 01:27:35.693]  Well, they've also bought off the churches to brainwash with Romans 13.
[01:27:36.314 --> 01:27:37.436]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:27:38.478 --> 01:27:42.386]  Well, I do believe that we are seeing possibly the end times.
[01:27:43.468 --> 01:27:48.332]  But my husband passed away, you probably knew that, in May, and he was a great patriot.
[01:27:48.352 --> 01:27:51.274]  Yeah, I meant to say sorry to you, but I think we've had you on there since.
[01:27:51.294 --> 01:27:53.375]  Yeah, but he was great before he died.
[01:27:53.395 --> 01:27:55.577]  He had no regrets at all.
[01:27:55.617 --> 01:27:58.699]  He just looked at his friends, and he really felt sorry for all of them.
[01:27:58.719 --> 01:27:59.500]  He said, you know what?
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:03.022]  You have to admit that I sure chose the right time to check out.
[01:28:04.463 --> 01:28:06.485]  And I thought that was a wonderful way to go.
[01:28:06.505 --> 01:28:10.348]  I mean, he just looked at everything, and I'm glad he didn't see this.
[01:28:12.489 --> 01:28:15.511]  Well, that's amazingly intense.
[01:28:15.851 --> 01:28:27.299]  You tell the story of your father dying, and you'd been taking care of him there, and he wasn't a bad guy, of course, you said, but he'd been skull and bones, bohemian grove, and you said at the end, he said he was sorry, or was upset about it?
[01:28:27.699 --> 01:28:31.481]  Yeah, well he said that he wished he had longer, because he'd help me.
[01:28:31.502 --> 01:28:33.022]  Yeah.
[01:28:33.683 --> 01:28:40.668]  That's what he said, and then my husband said, hey folks, you know how lucky I am, I'm getting out, I'm checking out early.
[01:28:42.594 --> 01:28:46.675]  Well, anyway, you have to have a sense of humor, too.
[01:28:47.696 --> 01:28:57.979]  Alex, I'm going to be arriving in Brussels at the same time all these horrible creatures are arriving.
[01:28:58.099 --> 01:29:03.441]  I'm going to be there with my relatives for three weeks.
[01:29:03.461 --> 01:29:05.642]  Is that strange synchronicity or is that serendipity?
[01:29:06.377 --> 01:29:20.746]  I don't know, but if they don't let me back in the country, I don't know whether I would be too upset, because if you ask me, when a push comes to shove on this one, we're going to be the most totalitarian dictatorship of all, because we've never had it before.
[01:29:20.806 --> 01:29:22.347]  They've lived under it over there.
[01:29:22.367 --> 01:29:24.289]  Well, they've got it, too.
[01:29:24.329 --> 01:29:25.429]  They've got it set up now.
[01:29:25.469 --> 01:29:27.811]  They've got it, but they're not going to have it as bad as us.
[01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:35.382]  We've got all these brainwashed people that have played simulated murders millions of times and they just want to kill.
[01:29:35.422 --> 01:29:38.985]  We've got, you know, the community-oriented policing system.
[01:29:39.365 --> 01:29:40.125]  You know what?
[01:29:40.205 --> 01:29:43.148]  I mean, they wouldn't allow, they don't allow that kind of thing in Europe.
[01:29:43.728 --> 01:29:46.750]  Because they live to a community-oriented policing.
[01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:48.772]  Yeah, notice it's England and the U.S.
[01:29:49.272 --> 01:29:49.893]  that are doing it.
[01:29:50.233 --> 01:29:51.714]  We're the worst!
[01:29:52.334 --> 01:29:53.095]  Here we go, Charlotte.
[01:29:54.816 --> 01:29:56.898]  Come, prepare for tomorrow now.
[01:29:59.683 --> 01:30:01.224]  Oh, Charlotte Iserby.
[01:30:01.505 --> 01:30:02.906]  I really appreciate her joining us.
[01:30:02.946 --> 01:30:07.649]  Go to Infowars.com, get the big, thick book she made.
[01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:14.074]  Most of it is just documents and photos, where they admit that their job is to break up the family, brain damage everybody, brainwash you.
[01:30:16.679 --> 01:30:20.121]  You can also go to her site and read the book for free, and people seem to take that for granted.
[01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:23.804]  Oh, Alex, you made a hundred and something thousand dollar film, and it's free on the web.
[01:30:23.824 --> 01:30:24.885]  I don't think I'll watch it.
[01:30:25.906 --> 01:30:30.329]  I don't care if the elites plan to exterminate me and my family, and you have all their public documents.
[01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:31.510]  I just deny that's real.
[01:30:31.691 --> 01:30:35.634]  Oh, so Charlotte Izzerby ran the whole department up there, the whole Department of Education.
[01:30:35.654 --> 01:30:38.596]  I don't think I'll even go read it.
[01:30:39.157 --> 01:30:39.957]  That's not true.
[01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:44.461]  Give us your website again, Charlotte.
[01:30:45.356 --> 01:30:47.798]  No, I just really wish it weren't true.
[01:30:47.918 --> 01:31:05.229]  I think that when we were leaving, at the break, we were discussing the exquisite refinement and smooth functioning of their agenda, which has been going on ever since the beginning of the last century.
[01:31:05.429 --> 01:31:11.253]  And even before, you know, when Quigley, as Quigley said in his book, Tragedy and Hope,
[01:31:12.188 --> 01:31:17.331]  Uh, the industrialists got together and they decided that they had to control both political parties.
[01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:23.255]  So when we go to the polls, uh, we'll think we're getting what we want, but we'll be getting what they want.
[01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:39.064]  And, you know, so all of it has been planned and, and, uh, Norman Dodd, you know, was told by Rowan Gaither, the president of the Ford Foundation, that, uh, they, the tax-exempt foundations, uh, they got their instructions from the White House at that time, President Dwight Eisenhower, and, uh,
[01:31:39.557 --> 01:31:46.461]  The instructions were to use their tax-exempt monies to change America so it could be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union.
[01:31:46.860 --> 01:32:13.682]  Which, of course, is nothing other than the international socialist system, with regions... And then, of course, McCarthy, who'd been allowed to run wild to set up a police state in the name of the right wing, once he found out and said, the army runs all this, the Pentagon, they said, oh, he's a crazy drunk, get rid of him, but in truth, he found out, and now the Soviet files have been released, and the New York Times had a line like five years ago, McCarthy was right, they were all Soviet agents, but the Soviets were our agents!
[01:32:14.346 --> 01:32:15.067]  Oh, that's right.
[01:32:15.108 --> 01:32:22.280]  I mean, we've been in bed with them for... You know the great book that I always... It's hard to find one book you could say is the most important.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:24.563]  The Naked Communist?
[01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:28.270]  No, I think it is from Major Jordan's diaries.
[01:32:30.433 --> 01:32:31.034]  Have a great day.
[01:32:45.868 --> 01:32:50.633]  Uh, Google it, and from Major Jordan's diary... And then they killed the Rosenbergs.
[01:32:50.693 --> 01:32:54.538]  It's now declassified that the nukes were given to the Soviets, the A-bomb technology.
[01:32:54.558 --> 01:32:55.499]  Yep.
[01:32:55.539 --> 01:32:58.983]  But then, you know, fry some dirty commies, and meanwhile the Pentagon's sending it all.
[01:32:59.323 --> 01:33:00.705]  Folks, it's totally staged.
[01:33:00.745 --> 01:33:02.086]  They're putting poison in your water.
[01:33:02.367 --> 01:33:03.348]  They're spraying you.
[01:33:03.448 --> 01:33:04.889]  Every evil's being carried out.
[01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:06.111]  It's evil!
[01:33:06.451 --> 01:33:08.413]  Most of us are going to die of the cancer they gave us.
[01:33:08.613 --> 01:33:09.574]  The numbers are exploding.
[01:33:09.934 --> 01:33:15.418]  All we can do is pray to God to protect us and help us and say no to the system and just fight it every way you can.
[01:33:16.399 --> 01:33:17.560]  Charlotte, be careful in Europe.
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:18.841]  I want to talk to you when you get back.
[01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.804]  You let me know about that meeting.
[01:33:22.844 --> 01:33:25.065]  Maybe I should go pull a Joan Vion.
[01:33:25.486 --> 01:33:28.348]  By the way, folks, Google Joan Vion.
[01:33:28.368 --> 01:33:29.789]  She has a lot of good stuff.
[01:33:30.349 --> 01:33:36.114]  She's so little, she could get away with going in there and talking to the Paul Volckers or whatever Pauls of the world.
[01:33:36.656 --> 01:33:38.958]  But I will be there during those meetings.
[01:33:39.358 --> 01:33:40.579]  Maybe I better just stay at home.
[01:33:40.639 --> 01:33:43.381]  I'm sure Brussels is going to be pretty crowded on the streets.
[01:33:44.501 --> 01:33:47.844]  Well, you've got the bankers in there figuring out how to scam the people the best.
[01:33:48.224 --> 01:33:53.728]  Well, I'll have to... I'm hoping that nobody's going to talk politics with me over there.
[01:33:53.768 --> 01:33:55.069]  I do speak French, but...
[01:33:55.942 --> 01:34:00.886]  You know, we'll just try to stay away from it, because the Europeans are pretty stupid, too, by the way.
[01:34:01.606 --> 01:34:02.547]  That's not very nice.
[01:34:02.587 --> 01:34:06.810]  No, no, Americans have 70 IQs, Europeans have 75, I know.
[01:34:07.051 --> 01:34:07.791]  Is that about it?
[01:34:08.031 --> 01:34:08.271]  Yeah.
[01:34:08.352 --> 01:34:09.152]  Okay, very good.
[01:34:09.172 --> 01:34:17.839]  Well, Alex, you take care of yourself, and God bless everybody, but don't... I don't want... I want people to remember what I said about Main Street.
[01:34:17.859 --> 01:34:19.300]  75% of our country is small business.
[01:34:19.975 --> 01:34:23.420]  Uh, we still have one another, and we are the majority.
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.467]  And these people should not be allowed to get so much media to scare us.
[01:34:29.048 --> 01:34:31.271]  So that we, there's really no hope whatsoever.
[01:34:31.311 --> 01:34:32.232]  I think there is hope.
[01:34:32.292 --> 01:34:34.155]  There is hope, there is hope, there is hope.
[01:34:34.876 --> 01:34:35.757]  Hope springs eternal.
[01:34:35.777 --> 01:34:36.418]  Thanks Charlotte.
[01:34:39.468 --> 01:34:41.568]  Thank you for listening to GCA Live.
[01:35:06.474 --> 01:35:08.294]  Continue there right now.
[01:35:08.414 --> 01:35:09.274]  Is Charlotte still there?
[01:35:11.055 --> 01:35:11.295]  John?
[01:35:12.155 --> 01:35:13.395]  No, Charlotte left us.
[01:35:13.515 --> 01:35:14.395]  Okay, she's gone.
[01:35:14.615 --> 01:35:17.876]  I should have got her to tell some skull and bones stories about her dad.
[01:35:18.656 --> 01:35:19.516]  Some hardcore stuff.
[01:35:19.996 --> 01:35:30.538]  But he got to hear her on the radio doing interviews while he was dying, and he's like, you know, it's true, it's right, everything you said, and you know, I wish I could now live longer and fight it, because I was part of it.
[01:35:31.018 --> 01:35:33.279]  I mean, again, ladies and gentlemen, this is real.
[01:35:34.019 --> 01:35:34.399]  This is real.
[01:35:36.025 --> 01:35:38.906]  Alright, do you have our next guest?
[01:35:40.987 --> 01:35:41.287]  John?
[01:35:41.307 --> 01:35:42.047]  Steve's all set.
[01:35:42.307 --> 01:35:46.489]  Okay, and then, you know, for God's sakes, he gets time zones mixed up.
[01:35:46.529 --> 01:35:47.109]  Love him to death.
[01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.789]  Bob Chapman.
[01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:52.851]  Make sure Trey calls him or emails him to make sure he's there in 15 minutes, okay?
[01:35:54.412 --> 01:35:55.192]  Alright, here we go.
[01:35:55.252 --> 01:35:55.592]  Here we go.
[01:35:56.072 --> 01:35:57.433]  And yes, folks, I'm fully aware I'm on air.
[01:36:11.574 --> 01:36:13.856]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[01:36:14.217 --> 01:36:15.158]  Truth is our weapon.
[01:36:15.398 --> 01:36:19.563]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:36:22.727 --> 01:36:24.649]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:36:25.129 --> 01:36:27.832]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:36:55.985 --> 01:36:58.328]  Steve is not just a sponsor of this show.
[01:36:58.348 --> 01:37:01.531]  I got Scoreable Foods for him the first time eight years ago.
[01:37:19.159 --> 01:37:20.660]  And I've gotten a lot of storable food.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.063]  Today, just got delivered two more pallets to my house, because I took some of the other food and gave it to family.
[01:37:26.684 --> 01:37:28.225]  And I got other family that laughs at me.
[01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:28.845]  Doesn't matter.
[01:37:28.885 --> 01:37:30.886]  I get food for them, like Noah, I guess.
[01:37:32.247 --> 01:37:34.809]  And, you know, that's what I try to do.
[01:37:35.789 --> 01:37:38.971]  The hyperinflation alone, buying storable food now, will save you money.
[01:37:39.892 --> 01:37:41.113]  And we had a Great Depression.
[01:37:41.173 --> 01:37:42.393]  Seven million people starved.
[01:37:42.533 --> 01:37:43.734]  Big university studies on that.
[01:37:43.754 --> 01:37:45.655]  Just Google, seven million starved during Great Depression.
[01:37:45.675 --> 01:37:46.416]  You'll find the studies.
[01:37:47.133 --> 01:37:47.994]  And that's conservative.
[01:37:48.454 --> 01:37:51.456]  And that's when at 90% we're, quote, self-sufficient on the land.
[01:37:52.397 --> 01:37:55.119]  We were a population of only 190 million or so.
[01:37:56.561 --> 01:38:02.846]  Now, if it breaks down completely, which is, I'd say, a 30-40% chance, it'll be a Road Warrior, Mad Max scenario.
[01:38:03.706 --> 01:38:05.328]  Regardless, you need storable foods.
[01:38:05.348 --> 01:38:14.535]  If you don't have gold, if you don't have firearms, if you don't have storable foods, if you don't have water filters, and by the way, Steve has those water filters as well, has some great little kits, you are insane.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:21.404]  Steve Shank, Midas Resources, one of the few gold brokers that can still get gold and silver.
[01:38:21.424 --> 01:38:28.729]  It's all over the news that most are sold out, mints are shutting down, a lot of food brokers are sold out or selling 10-15 year old crap.
[01:38:29.049 --> 01:38:36.094]  You've got new food, clean, non-GMO food, and thank God you put in giant stores into your warehouses.
[01:38:36.747 --> 01:38:41.330]  Well, what we did, Alex, is exactly the same thing that we're trying to tell people to do.
[01:38:42.591 --> 01:38:57.661]  We saw this coming because we're an advantage point at the supply end of the food chain, and we rolled every bit of capital that we could into putting in the supplies, and so now the warehouse is able to ship
[01:38:58.281 --> 01:39:04.406]  But I guess the main thing that we need today is, as much as we can, an update.
[01:39:04.466 --> 01:39:19.298]  There have been a couple of issues that have come up that I was, as long as I've been involved with this Alex, I have not been aware that grocery stores rely so heavily on credit in order to stock their shelves.
[01:39:19.378 --> 01:39:21.400]  What's happened with the
[01:39:22.745 --> 01:39:24.186]  With the takeover of the banks.
[01:39:24.246 --> 01:39:35.750]  Now, I don't know whether all of your listeners are familiar with this, but the interesting thing that happened is that they used that buyout money to buy into ownership in the banks.
[01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:45.753]  And as a result, what we're dealing with is not only ownership of the banks in the United States, but in Europe, a lot of it went to Europe, which
[01:39:46.494 --> 01:39:59.007]  And now in this debt system, the government, through the private banks that own it, banks above government and government above banks, the smaller banks, they are literally buying into the real economy so the government can shut it down.
[01:39:59.087 --> 01:39:59.748]  That's what it's about.
[01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.709]  Exactly.
[01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.910]  Absolutely.
[01:40:02.491 --> 01:40:03.352]  And here's the deal.
[01:40:04.215 --> 01:40:15.922]  What people don't realize is that the major grocery store chains are having difficulty because their credit has been cut back.
[01:40:16.442 --> 01:40:23.847]  The way they stock their shelves so that you folks have food on the shelves in the grocery store is through credit.
[01:40:24.682 --> 01:40:30.204]  The banks have cut back the credit and they're refusing credit to the grocery stores to restock.
[01:40:30.725 --> 01:40:37.928]  So what food that they have, they're having to charge ridiculous amounts more than normal runaway inflation.
[01:40:38.608 --> 01:40:43.270]  And as a result, it's going to put beyond, put the food beyond people's reach much more quickly.
[01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:47.532]  The other thing that's happened is the credit to the farmers.
[01:40:48.490 --> 01:40:48.810]  I think
[01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:06.290]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:41:06.330 --> 01:41:08.551]  We'll be right back with Steve Shett.
[01:41:30.325 --> 01:41:36.727]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:41:37.087 --> 01:41:39.068]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:41:39.728 --> 01:41:40.768]  But who is the enemy?
[01:41:41.269 --> 01:41:41.789]  Bin Laden.
[01:41:42.069 --> 01:41:43.009]  This is his MO.
[01:41:43.029 --> 01:41:44.430]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:45.930]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:53.172]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:41:53.572 --> 01:41:54.032]  Some U.S.
[01:41:54.072 --> 01:41:59.814]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:03.895]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:42:03.915 --> 01:42:14.158]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:42:14.398 --> 01:42:15.118]  Fabled Enemies.
[01:42:15.618 --> 01:42:22.931]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:42:23.392 --> 01:42:26.758]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists!
[01:42:30.051 --> 01:42:33.092]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:42:33.473 --> 01:42:35.533]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:42:35.794 --> 01:42:38.795]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:42:39.095 --> 01:42:45.578]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:42:45.978 --> 01:42:48.079]  Online, from my desk, with Webex.
[01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:51.641]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:42:51.881 --> 01:42:56.504]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:42:56.665 --> 01:43:00.367]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:43:00.587 --> 01:43:02.128]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:43:02.228 --> 01:43:04.710]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex free.
[01:43:04.890 --> 01:43:10.494]  Just click the radiographic and enter promo code 500 to get a free trial and a free webcam too.
[01:43:10.814 --> 01:43:11.615]  Remember that code 500.
[01:43:12.315 --> 01:43:12.816]  We're good.
[01:43:30.296 --> 01:43:39.044]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:43:39.224 --> 01:43:44.008]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:43:44.389 --> 01:43:55.499]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:43:55.879 --> 01:44:01.446]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:44:01.686 --> 01:44:07.753]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:44:07.933 --> 01:44:08.574]  What about you?
[01:44:08.975 --> 01:44:10.877]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:44:10.897 --> 01:44:13.080]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[01:44:31.736 --> 01:44:37.761]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:44:38.361 --> 01:44:41.324]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:44:50.404 --> 01:44:52.005]  All right, Bob Chapman is waiting in the wings.
[01:44:52.025 --> 01:44:53.685]  He'll be with us in about five minutes.
[01:44:54.286 --> 01:44:57.707]  We're talking to Steve Schenck, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:44:57.767 --> 01:45:02.409]  It's A. Michael Stevens, the longest-operating affordable foods company in the nation.
[01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:08.092]  And I can't wait to hear what he has to say about what's happening with his suppliers.
[01:45:08.572 --> 01:45:09.512]  Gold is drying up.
[01:45:09.592 --> 01:45:10.513]  Food is drying up.
[01:45:11.173 --> 01:45:12.354]  Why do you see oil dropping?
[01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:15.236]  Factories are coming to stand stills.
[01:45:15.656 --> 01:45:16.917]  People aren't buying fuel.
[01:45:16.957 --> 01:45:18.998]  The global economy is grinding to a halt.
[01:45:19.319 --> 01:45:22.661]  The private bankers have turned the money spigots off.
[01:45:23.062 --> 01:45:28.386]  They're now announcing a new global government to run everything and save us, when they're the ones that engineered it.
[01:45:29.226 --> 01:45:30.247]  Continue, Steve Chang.
[01:45:31.168 --> 01:45:37.673]  Very simply, the banks just recently acted worldwide in unison in adjusting the interest rate.
[01:45:38.513 --> 01:45:41.876]  Now, I am sure that they will declare a bank holiday shortly.
[01:45:42.877 --> 01:45:48.325]  One of the things that's going to happen is that people will not be able to get their funds or transfer funds.
[01:45:48.345 --> 01:45:57.298]  Now remember Alex, I've said many times, any one of a number of things can shut down the ability of eFoodsDirect to ship food.
[01:45:58.219 --> 01:46:08.388]  One of them could be if folks don't get their food ordered and the funds transferred so that we can continue to buy food out ahead.
[01:46:08.409 --> 01:46:09.489]  Hold on, excuse me, excuse me.
[01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:10.991]  I've got Bloomberg here in front of me.
[01:46:11.011 --> 01:46:11.952]  We're going to ask Bob in a minute.
[01:46:12.512 --> 01:46:19.919]  Are you telling me that when they talk about shutting down global markets, that you're hearing that they may shut down banks?
[01:46:21.104 --> 01:46:33.323]  Well, a bank holiday is what occurred in 29, and if they close the banks to recoup, let me put it this way, I don't know.
[01:46:34.207 --> 01:46:58.980]  But from everything that we have seen, and everything that we feel, and all of the predictions we've made in the past that have come true, I would wager that at some point in time, the banks worldwide in unison will shut down, at least for a period of time, to readjust their... Well, I mean, they're openly... Listen, for the last two weeks, they keep saying, your money's safe, your money's safe, your money's safe, when no one was talking about that, creating the fear.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.021]  There have been all sorts of runs, but banks have been able to supply.
[01:47:04.352 --> 01:47:04.773]  Keep going.
[01:47:05.615 --> 01:47:08.943]  All I'm saying is folks, food
[01:47:09.919 --> 01:47:12.140]  Is the answer for the individual.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.081]  We can talk about what's happening.
[01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:15.862]  We can talk about what it means.
[01:47:16.262 --> 01:47:23.146]  What it means to families right now, Alex, is they must get food in.
[01:47:23.546 --> 01:47:24.947]  Gold will not buy it.
[01:47:25.407 --> 01:47:26.867]  Silver will not buy it.
[01:47:27.528 --> 01:47:35.812]  And if, for some reason, it does occur that the banks do, in unison, function like they did with the interest rate,
[01:47:37.673 --> 01:47:55.724]  Well, listen, I want to say this, see, regardless of whatever's going to happen, the economy's getting worse, serious recession, leading into depression, massive compounded inflation coming, that's all over the news, so it's smart to get some horrible food.
[01:47:56.304 --> 01:47:59.685]  It's not only smart, it's the only possibility.
[01:47:59.885 --> 01:48:01.405]  Folks absolutely have to do it.
[01:48:01.605 --> 01:48:03.225]  I know the government's been hoarding food.
[01:48:03.265 --> 01:48:06.046]  The government's been hoarding it and calling us kooks if we do.
[01:48:06.586 --> 01:48:07.146]  Absolutely.
[01:48:07.666 --> 01:48:08.226]  Absolutely.
[01:48:08.287 --> 01:48:13.628]  And the thing is, is that food is the international mechanism of power.
[01:48:13.828 --> 01:48:14.888]  It absolutely is.
[01:48:15.208 --> 01:48:20.329]  When Castro took over, it was because all of the agriculture in Cuba
[01:48:20.849 --> 01:48:21.670]  We're good to go.
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:44.201]  Well, I hope you're wrong.
[01:48:44.221 --> 01:48:49.365]  You've been saying things are really bad for the last year plus here on the show, and it's all been coming true.
[01:48:49.385 --> 01:48:53.088]  I hope it's not as bad as you and many others are saying, but I know this.
[01:48:53.148 --> 01:48:57.351]  Rest assured, folks, it's a great place to get high-quality, freeze-dried and dehydrated food.
[01:48:57.711 --> 01:49:01.354]  Stores for more than 10 years and climate-controlled 10 years in your garage or attic.
[01:49:01.794 --> 01:49:02.835]  It's where I've gotten storable.
[01:49:02.875 --> 01:49:05.057]  I've tried it other places and had MSG and crud in it.
[01:49:05.397 --> 01:49:06.438]  This is the place to get it.
[01:49:06.858 --> 01:49:07.879]  Give them your number, Steve.
[01:49:07.899 --> 01:49:08.399]  800-409-5633.
[01:49:08.439 --> 01:49:08.559]  That's 800.
[01:49:12.562 --> 01:49:20.786]  409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com, and we'll help as much as we can for as long as we can.
[01:49:21.506 --> 01:49:26.328]  And you've also, again, we have links up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:31.811]  I hope Steve's wrong about the severity of things, but he's on the inside of it, so I believe him.
[01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:34.372]  I mean, I believe he believes what he's saying, for sure.
[01:49:34.392 --> 01:49:36.673]  I know this, you are insane.
[01:49:37.413 --> 01:49:41.136]  If you don't have firearms, swearable food, water filters, gold and silver.
[01:49:42.037 --> 01:49:44.718]  And food and water does come numero uno.
[01:49:45.719 --> 01:49:47.400]  And then you better have something to defend it.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.463]  And if you're afraid of guns, go buy a Louisville Slugger, folks.
[01:49:50.803 --> 01:49:52.264]  Go buy a big ball peen hammer.
[01:49:53.125 --> 01:49:54.485]  And I mean, because let me tell you something.
[01:49:54.526 --> 01:49:56.287]  I'm not worried about troops and martial law.
[01:49:56.747 --> 01:49:59.269]  I'm worried about hordes of rioting people.
[01:49:59.809 --> 01:50:02.591]  And I don't just mean poor inner city folks that don't get their welfare checks.
[01:50:02.631 --> 01:50:03.332]  I mean yuppies.
[01:50:04.199 --> 01:50:08.361]  And boy, you get an empty belly with one of these spoiled brats, you look out!
[01:50:08.381 --> 01:50:12.903]  And anybody comes in my house trying to rob me, my wife or I will kill you better than a hammer.
[01:50:13.263 --> 01:50:25.168]  So, a message to everybody, you know, is even if you go to these overpriced grocery stores, get something in, and if it doesn't happen this month or six months from now, understand folks, it's an insurance policy.
[01:50:25.448 --> 01:50:30.671]  We hope none of this happens, but the globalists are doing this by design, and let me tell you, it looks worse than I first thought.
[01:50:31.571 --> 01:50:33.572]  For those that missed it, give them that toll-free number.
[01:50:34.830 --> 01:50:44.756]  800-409-5633 800-409-5633 efoodsdirect.com And I just know this.
[01:50:44.856 --> 01:50:46.857]  It's such a healthy thing to do to be prepared.
[01:50:47.277 --> 01:50:47.858]  It's normal.
[01:50:48.038 --> 01:50:48.618]  Ants do it.
[01:50:49.078 --> 01:50:49.739]  Bugs do it.
[01:50:49.779 --> 01:50:50.399]  Birds do it.
[01:50:50.439 --> 01:50:51.159]  Squirrels do it.
[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:52.560]  Humans always did it.
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:54.461]  They've taken our instincts out of us.
[01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:58.003]  I mean, it's not enough to have a pantry full of food, folks.
[01:50:58.023 --> 01:50:59.264]  You've got to have a lot of food.
[01:50:59.784 --> 01:51:02.105]  If you want to be a single guy and don't care about yourself, fine.
[01:51:02.486 --> 01:51:02.906]  But listen.
[01:51:03.777 --> 01:51:09.300]  To the jackasses out there, if you have children and wives that are off running around and don't care, you better care.
[01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:16.665]  And you better sell some junk out of the garage, the jet ski you never use, the bass boat you never use, and get some storable food.
[01:51:17.105 --> 01:51:19.466]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:19.647 --> 01:51:25.810]  And if you want to wait around, you can also call and get a free brochure or audio CD, a lot of videos to watch at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:51:26.151 --> 01:51:27.271]  Steve, thank you for coming on.
[01:51:27.651 --> 01:51:28.372]  Take care, Alex.
[01:51:29.452 --> 01:51:29.753]  You bet.
[01:51:29.773 --> 01:51:31.274]  For the rest of the hour, we are joined by
[01:51:32.577 --> 01:51:34.858]  Well, I'll have to consult with Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:04.770]  Because he said the same thing.
[01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:06.871]  I know, a lot of other people said the same thing.
[01:52:07.431 --> 01:52:23.714]  Well, you know, no, this is going to play out still over a period of time and we still will see these Wall Street, Washington types trying to hold this thing together month after month, week after week.
[01:52:24.494 --> 01:52:29.314]  And for the whole thing to come crashing down, it's going to take a bit longer.
[01:52:30.195 --> 01:52:32.035]  And you're seeing the beginnings of
[01:52:33.479 --> 01:52:35.720]  Probably the end of the first phase here.
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:55.266]  And I expect the Dow, which is trading around 8400 right now, and is trying to stage a massive comeback today, which is certainly by the looks of what I can see on the tape, the United States government is in there running the market back up.
[01:52:56.046 --> 01:52:58.487]  But that is only going to help them for a day.
[01:52:59.187 --> 01:53:00.748]  The support level is 72.
[01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:17.746]  68, which I've said on this program many times, and that's where we'll stop for the time being, and then you'll probably get a rally based upon some sort of a package being put together, quote, to save the world.
[01:53:18.426 --> 01:53:24.508]  And that's what the G8 meeting is all about this weekend, which has already begun.
[01:53:25.628 --> 01:53:28.509]  And the last time they got together, they were very unsuccessful.
[01:53:29.524 --> 01:53:31.805]  And they hope to be successful this time.
[01:53:32.465 --> 01:53:35.986]  And I might add that Steve, who you just had on, is absolutely right.
[01:53:38.686 --> 01:53:45.708]  We've got Bloomberg reporting that they plan to try to set up a new world banking body, will buy carbon credits from them.
[01:53:46.048 --> 01:53:48.488]  The European legislation has carbon taxes in it.
[01:53:48.869 --> 01:53:51.689]  The banker immunity takeover bill has it in there.
[01:53:52.689 --> 01:53:54.850]  We now have the inner group of Goldman Sachs
[01:53:56.267 --> 01:54:06.055]  Putting the VP Kashkari in to literally inject money into Goldman Sachs, where he and Paulson still own hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:54:06.075 --> 01:54:11.139]  I mean, this is completely criminal, isn't it, to have them directly handing money to themselves?
[01:54:11.900 --> 01:54:12.600]  Absolutely.
[01:54:13.761 --> 01:54:16.644]  But, you know, you and I will talk about it in this station.
[01:54:16.664 --> 01:54:19.086]  There's a segment of society which will hear about it.
[01:54:19.873 --> 01:54:25.938]  And most of the people won't because it will not be in mainline media because they control mainline media.
[01:54:26.698 --> 01:54:30.702]  That's why we're on the air, but the point is that the public isn't going to realize that.
[01:54:31.302 --> 01:54:34.565]  They can't put two and two together, and they really don't care to.
[01:54:34.685 --> 01:54:37.527]  I mean, we've gone through that many times in this program.
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:40.022]  I had a guy laugh at me last night.
[01:54:40.042 --> 01:54:41.564]  I was picking food up at a restaurant.
[01:54:41.584 --> 01:54:42.525]  I was at the bar getting it.
[01:54:42.545 --> 01:54:43.686]  And a bunch of people came over.
[01:54:43.786 --> 01:54:44.306]  Oh, we love you.
[01:54:44.367 --> 01:54:45.187]  Oh, you're right about everything.
[01:54:45.227 --> 01:54:47.370]  And, you know, the public is waking up.
[01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:52.335]  We had 90, you know, 95 to 5 against it in polls.
[01:54:52.395 --> 01:54:54.177]  A thousand phone calls to one to Congress.
[01:54:54.437 --> 01:54:56.119]  Then they threatened martial law, as you know.
[01:54:56.539 --> 01:54:57.681]  And that came out on C-SPAN.
[01:54:57.701 --> 01:55:00.704]  They said, martial law, if you don't pass it, that means we're under martial law.
[01:55:01.323 --> 01:55:07.388]  I don't want to say they're all dumbbells, I think they're starting to wake up, but a couple of guys did laugh at me and make fun of me and I just felt sorry for them.
[01:55:07.468 --> 01:55:09.550]  They thought it was real funny what I was saying though.
[01:55:11.011 --> 01:55:23.122]  Well, you just smile and say, you know, thanks for recognizing the fact that I'm out there trying to do something and I hope you realize one of these days that we get some serious problems.
[01:55:24.378 --> 01:55:32.041]  And I wonder, where does that self-satisfied, you know that, you know what Eaton Grin, these people, these minions, they always giggle and laugh.
[01:55:32.061 --> 01:55:32.921]  They think it's all funny.
[01:55:32.961 --> 01:55:33.461]  What is that?
[01:55:34.822 --> 01:55:37.363]  Well, I think it's a nervous reaction.
[01:55:37.383 --> 01:55:41.364]  Because they really don't know, or they don't want to face what they know.
[01:55:42.324 --> 01:55:47.026]  And that's why smiling back at them, you know, kind of disarms them.
[01:55:47.806 --> 01:55:52.428]  And being nice by saying, well, I hope you do catch on.
[01:55:53.772 --> 01:55:55.894]  But, uh, you know, thanks for the compliment.
[01:56:10.784 --> 01:56:13.186]  But just a question, because we have time constraints here.
[01:56:13.206 --> 01:56:15.168]  A quick question from Bob Chapman.
[01:56:15.188 --> 01:56:15.268]  1-800-259-9231.

[01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:31.414]  The economy is collapsing all around us.
[01:57:31.554 --> 01:57:32.375]  Banks are closing.
[01:57:32.415 --> 01:57:36.937]  The Federal Reserve continues to pump billions of dollars into the system to try to stop the bleeding.
[01:57:37.198 --> 01:57:38.659]  Know who is to blame.
[01:57:38.779 --> 01:57:40.560]  The Federal Reserve System.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:42.981]  On November 22nd, the end begins.
[01:57:43.281 --> 01:57:47.564]  Every Federal Reserve Bank, every Federal Reserve Office, 38 cities, one purpose.
[01:57:47.824 --> 01:57:48.525]  End the Fed.

[01:57:49.085 --> 01:57:52.827]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?

[01:57:54.688 --> 01:57:57.810]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:58:12.216 --> 01:58:12.917]  It is liquid.
[01:58:13.217 --> 01:58:13.898]  It is private.
[01:58:14.258 --> 01:58:15.039]  It owes no one.
[01:58:15.059 --> 01:58:16.440]  It cannot go bankrupt.
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.682]  And it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:58:35.288 --> 01:58:36.909]  9-11 was an inside job!
[01:58:36.969 --> 01:58:38.090]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:58:38.110 --> 01:58:39.731]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:58:39.811 --> 01:58:42.674]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:58:42.714 --> 01:58:48.398]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:58:48.458 --> 01:58:55.963]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[01:58:56.003 --> 01:59:00.927]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:59:08.727 --> 01:59:12.150]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:59:12.170 --> 01:59:14.492]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:59:14.512 --> 01:59:20.498]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[01:59:20.538 --> 01:59:21.479]  Truth Rising.

[02:00:13.632 --> 02:00:18.134]  While the unions are big businessmen, and they're going down as fast as dinosaurs,
[02:00:45.677 --> 02:00:47.659]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.
[02:00:47.679 --> 02:00:49.160]  Just amazing research.
[02:00:49.821 --> 02:00:51.382]  They put these liars on TV.
[02:00:51.402 --> 02:00:52.143]  They're not stupid.
[02:00:52.203 --> 02:00:54.085]  They're put there to lie and twist and spin.
[02:00:54.285 --> 02:00:55.866]  They're wrong about 80% of the time.
[02:00:55.926 --> 02:00:56.507]  Bob's right about 95%.
[02:00:58.658 --> 02:01:01.040]  That's what we have on, people who are always right.
[02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:03.322]  That's the analyst we have on every day for you.
[02:01:03.342 --> 02:01:04.763]  And he's one of our favorites.
[02:01:05.404 --> 02:01:08.887]  Short segment, Bob, a long one coming up, but I want to just... Martial law.
[02:01:09.127 --> 02:01:12.410]  Congress being told, physically you'll be thrown out if you don't do this.
[02:01:12.490 --> 02:01:13.631]  That is martial law.
[02:01:13.912 --> 02:01:16.774]  Then the bill gives immunity and all these new powers to the bankers.
[02:01:17.094 --> 02:01:19.757]  They're busy grabbing up parts of the economy for themselves.
[02:01:20.217 --> 02:01:21.859]  When is this lawlessness going to end?
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:25.562]  Well, as long as we have the kind of Congress that we've got,
[02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:31.301]  It will continue indefinitely, and that's why we have to throw almost all of them out of office.
[02:01:31.922 --> 02:01:41.088]  We spare the Ron Pauls and people like him, which are only a handful, but we got to get rid of the rest of them, and then maybe we have a shot at stopping these people at least through
[02:01:41.588 --> 02:01:43.690]  Putting three things through the Congress.
[02:01:43.890 --> 02:01:51.395]  Well, how do you have a Congress where they've been told you can't see the Presidential Decision Directive 51, but the cover sheet says you run nothing now?
[02:01:51.715 --> 02:01:53.256]  Totally, that's treason right there.
[02:01:53.456 --> 02:01:59.560]  And then, oh, by the way, we'll send the Army in here to throw your ass out of here, excuse my French, if you don't do what we say.
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:04.243]  I mean, that should have been press conferences, freakouts, top story, president's been arrested.
[02:02:04.564 --> 02:02:07.886]  But no, it's like they expect that that's normal.
[02:02:10.001 --> 02:02:32.738]  Well, the only other answer, if you can't do it through the system, is that people, you know, once a good, stiff recession, depression gets underway, they're going to be very, very unruly and very unhappy, and they're going to be looking for answers, and they'll liable to get violent, and that's why they moved that division from Iraq back into the United States.
[02:02:34.522 --> 02:02:39.766]  But we all know that, you know, one division or one brigade is only good to hold Washington.
[02:02:41.427 --> 02:02:44.950]  They plan to let riots take place to sell the public on more troops.
[02:02:47.752 --> 02:02:48.752]  That could very well be.
[02:02:50.033 --> 02:02:52.275]  Bob, how bad is this going to get in the next six months?
[02:02:53.916 --> 02:03:01.882]  Well, I think they'll probably come up with some kind of a formula to get the banks lending to one another and loosening up the credit.
[02:03:02.726 --> 02:03:05.767]  And you'll have a hiatus probably of a year or two.
[02:03:06.728 --> 02:03:15.671]  And if they're successful in doing that, and I'm going to assume that they will be, the stock market will probably bounce and go up 1,000 points or 1,500.
[02:03:15.731 --> 02:03:17.772]  But it's not going to work.
[02:03:17.972 --> 02:03:22.994]  And with all of the money and credit they're putting into the system, which is in the trillions of dollars,
[02:03:23.979 --> 02:03:28.363]  We're going to have massive inflation, oil's going to go back up again, and so will the cost of food.
[02:03:28.443 --> 02:03:35.249]  So they've killed the real economy just to halfway patch up their central banking derivative scam?
[02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:41.734]  Yes, and they have done that time after time in history, never mind just recently.
[02:03:42.495 --> 02:03:52.203]  And they will try to find outlets to create a situation where they continue to do what they're doing and remain in power.
[02:03:53.170 --> 02:04:02.532]  And that has been their game, especially the game of misdirection and taking the people's ideas one way and they're going another.
[02:04:02.552 --> 02:04:04.572]  And it's just like profit.
[02:04:04.592 --> 02:04:07.492]  The profit's all for them and heck with the public.
[02:04:08.193 --> 02:04:08.713]  That's right.
[02:04:08.753 --> 02:04:13.293]  I mean, they are insuring their profits while holding the debt.
[02:04:13.634 --> 02:04:14.254]  Unbelievable.
[02:04:14.654 --> 02:04:21.255]  And then terrorizing the public saying you better acquiesce to all our demands or the economy will be screwed while they're destroying it.
[02:04:23.047 --> 02:04:25.369]  Bob, how bad is the hyperinflation going to get?
[02:04:26.730 --> 02:04:36.717]  Well, at the rate they're pouring money in, I would say a real conservative estimate is somewhere between 25 and 50 percent over the next two years.
[02:04:38.338 --> 02:04:42.942]  And it will be re-reflected in the things that we buy again.
[02:04:43.783 --> 02:04:49.307]  The prices for oil and gas and energy products and food have come down.
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:05:02.989]  And they'll base out somewhere in here, and they'll start moving back up again, because they're just a symptom of the underlying problem, which is the creation of money and credit, with nothing backing it up.
[02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:07.172]  I mean, the Fed's doing it, and the Treasury's doing it.
[02:05:09.374 --> 02:05:19.001]  You know, I was asked this morning on another program, where are we going with this amount of money that's going to have to be paid by the American taxpayer?
[02:05:19.722 --> 02:05:25.825]  And I said, I have now decided that it's not any longer three to ten trillion dollars that we're going to be outside.
[02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:29.487]  It's ten to thirty trillion dollars, and I don't know where.
[02:05:29.927 --> 02:05:31.308]  I just know it's going to be awful.
[02:05:31.948 --> 02:05:37.071]  Well, they've passed in the new bill, and in previous ones, the IRS, no judge, no jury, no system.
[02:05:37.091 --> 02:05:39.272]  They just are now imperial legates.
[02:05:39.692 --> 02:05:41.313]  They just seize whatever they want.
[02:05:42.133 --> 02:05:42.573]  That's right.
[02:05:43.334 --> 02:05:44.274]  That's part of that bill.
[02:05:44.794 --> 02:05:45.875]  God, it's going to be horrible.
[02:05:46.914 --> 02:05:48.116]  People haven't seen anything yet.
[02:05:48.136 --> 02:05:49.878]  That's why a lot of people are leaving the country.
[02:05:53.061 --> 02:05:57.166]  And if you don't hand it over to them, a SWAT team will drop by and gun you and your family down.
[02:05:57.527 --> 02:06:00.790]  The problem is, people are going to start fighting back, aren't they, Bob?
[02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:02.613]  They certainly will, and they won't be alone.
[02:06:03.534 --> 02:06:07.078]  And so, the government's going to have their hands full.
[02:06:08.729 --> 02:06:11.911]  Hey, tough guys out there, you were looking for a fight with the American people.
[02:06:12.451 --> 02:06:14.912]  You're gonna get one, and let me tell you, I'm not pleased with it.
[02:06:15.133 --> 02:06:17.114]  I know you are, until you figure out what it means.
[02:06:17.134 --> 02:06:18.194]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[02:06:20.095 --> 02:06:21.016]  We're on the march.
[02:06:21.496 --> 02:06:23.077]  The empire's on the run.
[02:06:24.017 --> 02:06:26.719]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:32.111]  Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.
[02:06:32.371 --> 02:06:38.138]  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a poison control center immediately.
[02:06:38.598 --> 02:06:41.201]  Why would you or your family use a product with this warning?
[02:06:41.521 --> 02:06:50.471]  If you're looking for a safe and natural alternative to keep your teeth healthy, clean, and sparkling, then you need SoliSmile All Natural Tooth Powder, the first tooth powder of its kind.

[02:07:33.341 --> 02:07:36.482]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:07:36.822 --> 02:07:38.783]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:07:39.443 --> 02:07:40.524]  But who is the enemy?
[02:07:41.004 --> 02:07:41.524]  Bin Laden.
[02:07:41.804 --> 02:07:42.705]  This is his ammo.
[02:07:42.725 --> 02:07:43.985]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:07:43.985 --> 02:07:44.145]  Some U.S.
[02:07:44.165 --> 02:07:46.627]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:07:46.647 --> 02:07:48.228]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:13.890]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:08:14.110 --> 02:08:14.870]  Fabled enemies.

[02:08:23.098 --> 02:08:26.461]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[02:08:31.411 --> 02:08:33.653]  They say you can't predict the stock market.
[02:08:33.953 --> 02:08:37.135]  If you trade on a regular basis, you've probably heard that lie.
[02:08:37.415 --> 02:08:42.639]  But what if I told you there's a way to know which way the market will go each week, a whole week in advance?
[02:08:43.039 --> 02:08:45.441]  Do you think you could benefit from this kind of information?
[02:08:45.821 --> 02:08:50.164]  The guys over at eminiforecaster.com put out a weekly forecast line.
[02:08:50.404 --> 02:08:55.327]  They call it a G-Line, which forecasts the direction of the stock market a whole week in advance.
[02:08:55.768 --> 02:08:56.268]  Impossible?

[02:09:30.042 --> 02:09:33.923]  Our guest is Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, dot com.
[02:09:34.003 --> 02:09:35.584]  In constant sorrow, who is there?
[02:09:51.357 --> 02:09:53.119]  The end of the show, the markets are going to be closing.
[02:09:53.139 --> 02:09:55.301]  We'll give you final numbers.
[02:09:55.381 --> 02:09:59.884]  Before we go back to Bob, I want to tell you about a cola blue, talking about preparedness.
[02:10:00.485 --> 02:10:02.647]  Stop bringing government poison water.
[02:10:03.488 --> 02:10:08.552]  Hundreds of forms of toxic waste, sodium fluoride, other stuff by design, mercury lead.
[02:10:08.652 --> 02:10:11.655]  It's in all the government documents that all the top scientists are on.
[02:10:11.675 --> 02:10:12.475]  You've heard them.
[02:10:12.796 --> 02:10:15.418]  You are insane if you don't
[02:10:16.167 --> 02:10:22.471]  Filter your water properly, and the Ecolablu is a great way to do it, because this is water right out of the air.
[02:10:23.392 --> 02:10:27.414]  And, then it goes through five filter systems.
[02:10:28.595 --> 02:10:35.960]  It passes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver impregnated carbon filter, then a reverse osmosis system, just that alone gets everything out, basically.
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:44.846]  Then a taste and odor removal filter, and is stored in a tank, illuminated by an antibacterial fungal UV light.
[02:10:47.265 --> 02:10:50.546]  866-585-4044, 7.5 gallons a day, out of the air.
[02:10:50.586 --> 02:10:55.107]  You can plug it into a solar panel or plug it into your wall, put it on your porch, your kitchen, whatever.
[02:10:55.127 --> 02:11:00.249]  It comes in a bunch of different colors.
[02:11:00.269 --> 02:11:05.330]  866-585-4044, 866-585-4044, Ecoloblue.com, a banner up on Infowars.com.
[02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:11.492]  Bob, I want to take some phone calls from Sean, Jay, Casey, German, and
[02:11:12.699 --> 02:11:13.799]  I can't pronounce that name.
[02:11:14.279 --> 02:11:15.800]  Jermaine and John and others.
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:20.441]  But you heard, you were saying you agreed with Schenck earlier.
[02:11:22.302 --> 02:11:25.462]  They've got the Global Finance Minister's meeting in secret.
[02:11:25.482 --> 02:11:27.783]  They'll have a press conference this weekend in Washington.
[02:11:28.163 --> 02:11:34.325]  And they're saying they may shut down the global markets next week while they iron something out, i.e.
[02:11:34.345 --> 02:11:35.525]  their takeover of everything.
[02:11:36.532 --> 02:11:41.436]  We know they're using this time to regulate good banks and stocks and go after things they want to snatch up.
[02:11:41.796 --> 02:11:43.597]  So lots of predatory criminal action going on.
[02:11:43.617 --> 02:11:48.000]  A, can you talk about, do you think that that's going to happen or is there a chance of that?
[02:11:48.140 --> 02:11:50.622]  And what about, Shank, talking about bank holidays?
[02:11:50.662 --> 02:11:51.723]  I mean, is that in the cards?
[02:11:53.384 --> 02:11:57.107]  Well, in this kind of an environment, anything can be expected.
[02:11:57.827 --> 02:12:01.870]  So, in order to prepare yourself, and we've spoken about this on the program before,
[02:12:03.215 --> 02:12:10.077]  You should have operating funds in whatever institution you're using, whether it's a bank, savings loan, credit union, money market fund.
[02:12:10.857 --> 02:12:16.558]  The rest of it should be out of there, and in gold and silver-related assets, particularly at this time.
[02:12:16.578 --> 02:12:28.121]  And also, people should have $5,000 or $10,000 in small bills, and they're safe at home in case there is a shutdown of the system, let's say, hypothetically, for a week.
[02:12:29.101 --> 02:12:32.022]  And I've done that, and I think everybody should do that.
[02:12:32.760 --> 02:12:34.743]  We live in an unusual time.
[02:12:34.803 --> 02:12:37.707]  We haven't seen things like this since the early 1930s.
[02:12:39.498 --> 02:12:42.420]  And, uh, we're probably going to have a depression which is worse than that.
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.322]  We'll see about that, as you know.
[02:12:44.342 --> 02:12:50.446]  Well, I mean, I'll start over, because I interrupted, but I want you to talk about the fact that that's what's killing the economy, as you know.
[02:12:50.886 --> 02:12:52.928]  They're shutting off credit, but not just credit.
[02:12:53.528 --> 02:13:07.158]  Uh, as these banks fold and things fail, businesses have got their money tied up, and myself, almost all my money, quote, is in the bank, just to run info wars, because our mission isn't to make money, it's to fight the New World Order, and so I could get in that position very quickly.
[02:13:09.116 --> 02:13:09.536]  That's right.
[02:13:10.497 --> 02:13:11.097]  Absolutely.
[02:13:11.137 --> 02:13:15.080]  And then you were talking about how business is very, very vulnerable.
[02:13:16.101 --> 02:13:28.309]  And anybody who deals in accepting credit cards and checks, which we all do, but businesses do in a very large way, if they shut you down for a week, what are you going to do?
[02:13:29.258 --> 02:13:30.760]  I mean, you can't deliver anything.
[02:13:32.321 --> 02:13:34.203]  You can't receive any funds in.
[02:13:34.223 --> 02:13:38.948]  Your bank says, look, we're shut down.
[02:13:39.328 --> 02:13:40.049]  We can't take them.
[02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:45.274]  You have to hold them until this duration is over that we're being made to shut down.
[02:13:45.494 --> 02:13:48.858]  Won't that be an economy killer if they do shut things down for a week?
[02:13:50.559 --> 02:13:51.020]  It'll hurt.
[02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:53.551]  How much I can't say.
[02:13:55.213 --> 02:13:57.935]  Talk about a confidence killer.
[02:13:58.196 --> 02:14:01.119]  Now when I interrupted you were talking about how bad the depression will probably get.
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:11.870]  Yeah, there was one in 1870 after the Civil War that was worse than the one we had in the 1929 up until the Second World War period.
[02:14:12.766 --> 02:14:23.694]  And I think it may be more like that one, which was more violent and sent a lot of people from the eastern seaboard in the Midwest out to the wild, wild west in those days.
[02:14:24.675 --> 02:14:28.278]  And Tony, there's no wild, wild west to go to anymore.
[02:14:28.958 --> 02:14:32.801]  But we are going to see those kind of things.
[02:14:32.841 --> 02:14:39.005]  Now, if the people who are running this thing, this G7, G8 meeting,
[02:14:40.883 --> 02:14:41.263]  Smart.
[02:14:41.684 --> 02:14:49.187]  What they'll do is, if they're going to have a bank closure, they'll have it for three days or something like that, and the public can live with it.
[02:14:49.867 --> 02:14:59.192]  What they hope to accomplish during any period of time that they would have shut down, I don't know, because I think they probably have all the numbers they want in front of them.
[02:15:00.472 --> 02:15:04.214]  So, the bottom line is be prepared.
[02:15:05.234 --> 02:15:20.300]  It goes along with the food, which Steve talked about, which I'm real big on, and filters, and you talk about weapons and ammo and clips, and you people should have been doing this when we were talking about it for years.
[02:15:21.681 --> 02:15:22.661]  And now it's time.
[02:15:22.721 --> 02:15:23.642]  It's crunch time.
[02:15:24.102 --> 02:15:27.804]  And this is going to go on indefinitely for five to ten years.
[02:15:28.444 --> 02:15:28.944]  Oh, man.
[02:15:29.264 --> 02:15:31.125]  The crime is just going to explode.
[02:15:32.242 --> 02:15:34.662]  I know it is, but there's not much you can do about it.
[02:15:35.003 --> 02:15:41.484]  I mean, they laid this thing out, and they're doing what they want to do, and we have to stand by and hope to survive.
[02:15:41.744 --> 02:15:44.904]  Can you imagine Chicago and New York where there's total gun bans?
[02:15:45.444 --> 02:15:46.064]  What the crime?
[02:15:46.124 --> 02:15:49.445]  It's already, you know, 20 murders a week or something in Chicago.
[02:15:49.785 --> 02:15:50.665]  Can you imagine?
[02:15:50.705 --> 02:15:54.686]  I mean, thank God I'm at least in Texas where people try to steal, they get killed.
[02:15:57.726 --> 02:16:00.727]  Well, I think in all major cities it'll be a problem.
[02:16:02.595 --> 02:16:08.217]  Those people who live in major cities should be well armed and know how to use their weapons to defend their home.
[02:16:08.238 --> 02:16:19.803]  I don't think people should go walking the streets with them, but you may have to do that in time, but just to defend your family and those are things you just have to do.
[02:16:20.644 --> 02:16:24.666]  Well, we saw... You know, for years, let me tell you a story, for years and years,
[02:16:25.919 --> 02:16:31.384]  All the years I lived in California, which was 36, I carried a weapon illegally every day.
[02:16:31.464 --> 02:16:34.447]  My wife did, and when my kids were old enough, they did too.
[02:16:35.407 --> 02:16:37.549]  And you always hope that nothing happens.
[02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:40.172]  I had a home invasion robbery and a shootout.
[02:16:41.152 --> 02:16:48.098]  My son was at a dance one night, and his gang of young people with guns were going to kill him.
[02:16:48.859 --> 02:16:50.981]  And when he whipped out his gun and started shooting,
[02:16:51.671 --> 02:16:52.492]  They all ran away.
[02:16:53.132 --> 02:16:57.556]  So there's something to be said about being armed, whether it's within the law or not.
[02:16:59.837 --> 02:17:02.039]  Well, why can the police be armed to protect themselves?
[02:17:02.059 --> 02:17:03.160]  I'm not saying take their guns.
[02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:04.221]  We have a right.
[02:17:04.681 --> 02:17:06.122]  I don't care what the state says to do that.
[02:17:06.162 --> 02:17:07.523]  Bob, am I getting you right?
[02:17:07.543 --> 02:17:10.866]  You're saying we are going to have a crazy depression?
[02:17:12.227 --> 02:17:12.927]  Absolutely.
[02:17:13.348 --> 02:17:14.469]  There's no avoiding it.
[02:17:16.350 --> 02:17:19.893]  And what's the percentage chance that it's going to go road warrior, Mad Max?
[02:17:21.981 --> 02:17:23.041]  About 9 out of 10.
[02:17:25.422 --> 02:17:25.862]  Oh, really?
[02:17:25.882 --> 02:17:28.383]  So you're thinking it's just going to completely degenerate?
[02:17:28.823 --> 02:17:29.123]  It is.
[02:17:29.283 --> 02:17:30.264]  It is going to be that.
[02:17:30.324 --> 02:17:39.146]  And the reason why is we don't have the culture that we had during the 1930s, which is the nearest example, time-wise.
[02:17:40.127 --> 02:17:43.428]  And there wasn't as much crime during the 1930s, even though we had
[02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:51.986]  Uh, depression, and you hear about, uh, Dillinger and Nelson and people like that, but they were the exception.
[02:17:52.846 --> 02:17:56.409]  I mean, today we have rampant crime, although it's down from what it was.
[02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:57.991]  It'll rise again.
[02:17:58.051 --> 02:18:00.072]  It'll be, it'll be unbelievable.
[02:18:00.112 --> 02:18:06.117]  You have gangs in America today that are 2,000 strong that have better weapons than the police have.
[02:18:07.318 --> 02:18:09.520]  In fact, they have weapons almost as good as what we've got.
[02:18:13.877 --> 02:18:23.523]  Bob, what's it going to look like when IRS SWAT teams... I mean, if even one home out of a hundred fights back, there won't be any IRS agents left.
[02:18:24.224 --> 02:18:25.024]  Well, that's okay.
[02:18:26.005 --> 02:18:27.166]  They chose the profession.
[02:18:27.406 --> 02:18:30.748]  They're following the orders that they've been given, which are illegal.
[02:18:31.628 --> 02:18:33.990]  And if they want to die, they came to the right place.
[02:18:35.771 --> 02:18:37.212]  People are not going to put up with that.
[02:18:38.226 --> 02:18:49.290]  People want to respect and live up to the law, but when the law is wrong, and it's anti-ethical, anti-people, you have to defend your human rights.
[02:18:51.610 --> 02:18:57.652]  Well, this is a barbarous country with a barbarous history, and in a way I'm proud of that, that we're not cowering, simpering wimps.
[02:18:58.953 --> 02:19:02.194]  I think the establishment's aware of that, but I don't think they really know what they're bargaining for, Bob.
[02:19:02.994 --> 02:19:03.694]  I don't either.
[02:19:03.814 --> 02:19:05.855]  They think that they're masters of the universe,
[02:19:06.368 --> 02:19:12.372]  That they've done this over and over again through the last thousand years, and they think they're going to get away with it again.
[02:19:12.412 --> 02:19:20.758]  Well, if they think that that's going to happen, they're going to have to arrange for the extinction of the entire population of the United States.
[02:19:21.318 --> 02:19:29.023]  Because they're going to come head-to-head probably with 30 million people who are capable of doing all kinds of things that they wish they could do.
[02:19:31.025 --> 02:19:33.286]  Let's talk to Sean in California.
[02:19:33.306 --> 02:19:34.507]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:19:36.198 --> 02:19:40.199]  Yeah, hey Alex and Bob, thanks, I've been listening to you guys for a couple years now.
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:57.365]  I was listening to Washington Journal this morning with this sniveling guy named Yuri Dadish, D-A-D-U-S-H, World Bank Economic Department Director, and he was trying to sell his whole globalization of money thing.
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:04.924]  And I have about a minute, minute and a half of the audio, if you want to listen to that, otherwise I can just post it up on the website.
[02:20:05.245 --> 02:20:10.288]  Yeah, post it up on the Prison Planet Forum, because they're all over calling for world government right now as the savior.
[02:20:10.328 --> 02:20:18.333]  So people know, we've got articles up on InfoWars and Prison Planet about that, and we don't have time to play it, but do you want Bob to comment on them pushing for a world system?
[02:20:18.693 --> 02:20:26.399]  Yeah, the thing I was going to say is that he mentioned InfoWars and Ron Paul, the bailout, Bilderberg, he got a lot of really cool keywords in there.
[02:20:26.780 --> 02:20:27.160]  Who did?
[02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:27.921]  It was pretty funny.
[02:20:28.081 --> 02:20:28.901]  Oh, a caller did?
[02:20:29.902 --> 02:20:42.192]  A caller actually called in and started talking about InfoWars and that he got, he gets all of his information from Ron Paul and InfoWars and mentioned Bilderberg and the bailout and a few other key words, so I thought it was pretty apt.
[02:20:42.252 --> 02:20:44.134]  What did the World Bank sniveller do?
[02:20:45.525 --> 02:20:46.946]  Okay, so here's the funny thing, right?
[02:20:47.726 --> 02:20:49.827]  Is he totally lost it on air.
[02:20:50.527 --> 02:20:53.388]  And he just basically was sniveling.
[02:20:53.668 --> 02:20:57.309]  I remember how you talk about them getting that weird face.
[02:20:58.190 --> 02:21:01.551]  And he just lost it and he didn't even have a good response.
[02:21:01.571 --> 02:21:02.591]  Well, now I've got to hear it.
[02:21:02.611 --> 02:21:05.812]  The problem is, you've got to put the phone right up by the speaker.
[02:21:05.852 --> 02:21:06.673]  Go ahead and play the clip.
[02:21:07.193 --> 02:21:09.914]  Yeah, probably not that you can't hear it, but... Alright, go ahead and play it.
[02:21:09.934 --> 02:21:11.134]  Okay, here you go.
[02:21:12.615 --> 02:21:13.475]  Yeah, come on.
[02:21:14.385 --> 02:21:20.648]  Uh, I know on NPR, I think about a year ago, a year and a half ago, I was listening.
[02:21:20.749 --> 02:21:24.731]  I believe that the World Bank forgave 180 nations their foreign debt.
[02:21:25.291 --> 02:21:29.213]  But wasn't it true that that was as long as they gave up their natural resources?
[02:21:30.113 --> 02:21:32.315]  And I get a lot of information from InfoWars.
[02:21:32.815 --> 02:21:40.659]  I listen to Ron Paul and like he gave Bernanke a school and then he's the only one in Washington that has a clue how to fix this problem.
[02:21:42.088 --> 02:21:48.090]  I believe that if the federal government federalized the Federal Reserve, we should really fall back to Europe.
[02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:54.051]  And now you can read the information on that creature from Jekyll Island, which is an excellent book.
[02:21:54.151 --> 02:22:02.613]  Is there any comments you have, like how the Bilderberg Group planned to make North America Union and destroy the middle class in the United States?
[02:22:02.653 --> 02:22:04.874]  Okay, I think there's a lot of issues on the table.
[02:22:04.954 --> 02:22:08.054]  What about the federalizing the Reserve?
[02:22:09.375 --> 02:22:11.075]  I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
[02:22:11.542 --> 02:22:12.923]  The Federal Reserve?
[02:22:13.084 --> 02:22:13.924]  Yes, yes.
[02:22:16.367 --> 02:22:17.949]  Okay, I didn't quite catch the question.
[02:22:17.989 --> 02:22:22.873]  Well, the Federal Reserve is, of course, part of the system of US governments already.
[02:22:30.860 --> 02:22:33.643]  Alright, we don't have time to play it all.
[02:22:33.683 --> 02:22:34.304]  Thank you, Caller.
[02:22:34.344 --> 02:22:35.845]  Post it up on YouTube.
[02:22:35.905 --> 02:22:37.607]  Post it up on Prison Planet.
[02:22:37.987 --> 02:22:40.009]  Shouted to me, the audio wasn't that good.
[02:22:40.029 --> 02:22:41.951]  Like, he was saying it was federal and lying.
[02:22:41.971 --> 02:22:42.672]  Did you hear that, Bob?
[02:22:43.326 --> 02:22:45.767]  Yeah, and he really did lose it.
[02:22:46.747 --> 02:22:47.928]  He didn't know what to say.
[02:22:47.988 --> 02:22:50.549]  I mean, they don't get confronted.
[02:22:50.589 --> 02:23:04.313]  What's going to happen when they get confronted by some 25-year-old father whose kids were just shot by the government, and he's standing in front of this guy from the IMF ready to fill them full of holes?
[02:23:05.134 --> 02:23:07.355]  I mean, this is where this is all going to end up.
[02:23:07.815 --> 02:23:11.316]  They pushed us right to the limit, and you're going to see it happen.
[02:23:12.558 --> 02:23:12.958]  Amazing.
[02:23:12.978 --> 02:23:15.440]  I want to try to get to everybody here because we're low on time.
[02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:16.681]  Jay in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:23:18.343 --> 02:23:19.344]  Hello, Alex and Bob.
[02:23:20.024 --> 02:23:30.352]  Listen, I was in one of my classes a couple semesters ago at a local university, and it's a fairly prominent, large state university.
[02:23:31.493 --> 02:23:39.880]  And we brought in the head of the economics department, and she lectured on the EU economy and mentioned the central bank in Frankfurt, Germany.
[02:23:41.070 --> 02:23:43.031]  And so I posed several questions to her.
[02:23:43.991 --> 02:23:46.992]  She's got several degrees in economics.
[02:23:47.632 --> 02:23:49.373]  I questioned her about fiat currencies.
[02:23:50.173 --> 02:23:55.335]  And she pointed out that everything in the EU is basically exactly the same as the Federal Reserve System here.
[02:23:55.355 --> 02:24:04.418]  And if you do a little research, you'll notice that Jean-Claude Trichet is the current head of the World Bank.
[02:24:04.758 --> 02:24:07.179]  I'm sorry, excuse me, of the EU Central Bank.
[02:24:08.339 --> 02:24:09.280]  He's actually a member of the G30.
[02:24:10.566 --> 02:24:16.289]  And so for all the skeptics, I just want to encourage them to study who the G30 is, and you'll find out.
[02:24:16.329 --> 02:24:18.229]  How are there even skeptics anymore?
[02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:19.410]  It's all out in the open!
[02:24:20.530 --> 02:24:29.575]  Well, I know you know that, but we encounter every day people who are still in denial and still haven't, you know, seen through the microscope.
[02:24:29.655 --> 02:24:31.255]  You don't keep on telling them.
[02:24:31.315 --> 02:24:31.535]  Right.
[02:24:32.036 --> 02:24:34.057]  I just want to get your analysis, Bob.
[02:24:34.117 --> 02:24:36.698]  Is it basically, is that correct?
[02:24:37.719 --> 02:24:46.244]  I mean, her admission of the fact that it's the exact same system, it's fiat currency, it's, you know... Look, European private banks own about half the Federal Reserve, Bob.
[02:24:47.004 --> 02:24:47.685]  That's correct.
[02:24:49.065 --> 02:24:49.646]  So, same people!
[02:24:49.666 --> 02:24:52.407]  That's true of their interest in banks in the United States.
[02:24:54.488 --> 02:24:55.669]  You know, nothing has changed.
[02:24:55.729 --> 02:24:57.030]  They still are in control.
[02:24:57.610 --> 02:24:59.111]  You know, I used to live in the Bahamas.
[02:24:59.870 --> 02:25:03.331]  And I found out the Central Bank was owned by people in England.
[02:25:03.771 --> 02:25:04.451]  It's always the same.
[02:25:04.471 --> 02:25:05.212]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:25:05.492 --> 02:25:06.132]  Same scum.
[02:25:06.152 --> 02:25:06.732]  Thank you, Jay.
[02:25:07.032 --> 02:25:08.853]  Casey in California, trying to move quicker.
[02:25:08.973 --> 02:25:09.713]  Casey, go ahead.
[02:25:10.933 --> 02:25:11.894]  Quick question, guys.
[02:25:11.974 --> 02:25:13.854]  No one ever brings up Catherine Austin Fitts.
[02:25:13.894 --> 02:25:15.375]  Have you guys ever mentioned her on your show, Alex?
[02:25:15.395 --> 02:25:16.615]  Yeah, I had her on years ago.
[02:25:16.675 --> 02:25:18.015]  I've told Fred to get her back on.
[02:25:18.075 --> 02:25:20.056]  I will tell him again when the show ends.
[02:25:21.056 --> 02:25:22.237]  I want Catherine Austin Fitts.
[02:25:22.257 --> 02:25:23.997]  She was at HUD.
[02:25:24.317 --> 02:25:26.378]  She talked about this eight years ago, broke it down.
[02:25:26.937 --> 02:25:28.799]  Yeah, it's all coming in light.
[02:25:28.819 --> 02:25:30.420]  The wheels are coming off pretty much.
[02:25:32.401 --> 02:25:36.585]  Catherine is a subscriber, a long-term subscriber to The Forecaster.
[02:25:37.485 --> 02:25:41.088]  And she's a very, very bright, very successful woman.
[02:25:42.589 --> 02:25:44.391]  Gotta jump, Casey.
[02:25:44.431 --> 02:25:47.213]  I want to kind of try to get Jermaine in Brooklyn.
[02:25:47.233 --> 02:25:47.793]  Last caller.
[02:25:47.833 --> 02:25:48.734]  Jermaine, you're on the air.
[02:25:48.754 --> 02:25:49.154]  Go ahead.
[02:25:50.275 --> 02:25:51.276]  Hey, Alex.
[02:25:51.316 --> 02:25:52.857]  Mr. Chapman, how are you doing?
[02:25:52.877 --> 02:25:54.038]  This is my first time calling.
[02:25:54.897 --> 02:25:59.240]  I had a question about advice as far as what I'm about to ask you.
[02:25:59.641 --> 02:26:12.330]  I was laid off from a financial firm in July as a private boutique and I signed up for the 401k plan and it was with Nationwide and it's in the money market.
[02:26:12.831 --> 02:26:21.857]  Now my question is, even though taxes and penalties should be paid if you withdraw it before your age of retirement,
[02:26:23.873 --> 02:26:31.580]  I was wondering if it was wise to extract that money, you know, liquidate it and put some money aside for the tax to be paid.
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:33.702]  How far away are you from retirement?
[02:26:35.083 --> 02:26:35.944]  I'm 30 years old.
[02:26:36.144 --> 02:26:37.606]  You will never see that money.
[02:26:38.186 --> 02:26:42.210]  I mean, if we even make it through without being exterminated in 10 years, we'll be blessed.
[02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.510]  Bob?
[02:26:43.731 --> 02:26:46.434]  I'll pay the penalty and the taxes, take the money and
[02:26:47.390 --> 02:26:53.338]  Buy food or ammo or whatever and if you get lots of money then buy some gold and silver.
[02:26:58.065 --> 02:27:04.914]  I was just thinking because I wanted to extract because is the money market in Jeopardy if this market goes down?
[02:27:06.168 --> 02:27:13.054]  Well, the government says that they're going to insure money market funds for a year, but goodness knows what happens after that.
[02:27:13.734 --> 02:27:19.519]  And quite frankly, I just don't trust them and the idea and the economy and the financial system.
[02:27:19.599 --> 02:27:22.481]  And they're going to pay you off later with devalued dollars.
[02:27:22.521 --> 02:27:23.822]  Final segment with Bob Chapman.

[02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:54.062]  And now the bankers are openly saying they're setting up a new world order right by the banks.
[02:30:54.102 --> 02:30:59.626]  Bob Chapman, one of the leading experts on gold and silver, not just in holding them physically, but in the investments,
[02:31:00.696 --> 02:31:10.683]  The American Mint, the British Mint, the Canadian Mint, they're saying they're out of gold, can't buy it at what the market in paper claims it is, so they're just stopping selling it.
[02:31:11.104 --> 02:31:14.086]  Most of the dealers, as you know, are sold out or can't hardly get anything.
[02:31:14.446 --> 02:31:27.175]  Ted Anderson's been in this 30 years, so he's got a lot of sources that will trade to him and they won't with anybody else, so he's got some gold coins and silver as well, but I mean, how long can they cover that up?
[02:31:28.089 --> 02:31:33.637]  Uh, that, uh, that what the paper says isn't the reality of the physical, uh, availability.
[02:31:34.819 --> 02:31:37.723]  Well, they're not covering it up because the public is finding out.
[02:31:38.464 --> 02:31:41.649]  And I talk to people who don't know anything about anything.
[02:31:42.581 --> 02:31:44.903]  And like, you know, the things that we know.
[02:31:45.603 --> 02:31:52.449]  And they're saying, oh, people are starting to buy gold and silver coins because things are going to get very difficult.
[02:31:52.569 --> 02:31:57.873]  And so that has lent to the offtake of physical gold and silver.
[02:31:57.933 --> 02:31:59.734]  So what are you hearing on things being sold out?
[02:31:59.774 --> 02:32:02.556]  I mean, I see it in the news that most places... Oh, it is real.
[02:32:02.836 --> 02:32:04.017]  It is real in Germany.
[02:32:04.778 --> 02:32:09.021]  There's been a memo sent to all the banks to stop selling gold and silver.
[02:32:10.666 --> 02:32:11.066]  Period.
[02:32:11.406 --> 02:32:15.568]  But in most parts of the world, there's very little product available.
[02:32:16.409 --> 02:32:28.235]  And you just mentioned that, but Ted, you know, because of his long years of contacts, is able to get some things to do business with.
[02:32:28.815 --> 02:32:36.199]  But, you know, I know personally of people who have tried to buy 50 or 100 ounces of gold in the form of coins,
[02:32:37.137 --> 02:32:40.441]  And I know one in particular just tried to buy 100, he got 57.
[02:32:41.022 --> 02:32:41.843]  And it took him a month.
[02:32:42.444 --> 02:32:43.986]  Absolutely, and it's accelerating.

[02:33:16.572 --> 02:33:17.833]  Bob, thanks for talking to us.
[02:33:17.853 --> 02:33:18.693]  We'll see you next week.
[02:33:19.193 --> 02:33:19.714]  You got it.
[02:33:19.774 --> 02:33:20.154]  Bye-bye.
[02:33:20.374 --> 02:33:20.854]  Take care.
[02:33:20.894 --> 02:33:24.536]  If there is a next week, I'm sure there will be financially, but God knows.
[02:33:25.017 --> 02:33:27.138]  I want to bring in the last minute and a half Ted Anderson up.
[02:33:27.238 --> 02:33:29.839]  Ted, you've still got gold and silver.
[02:33:29.979 --> 02:33:31.000]  Tell us the coins you have.
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:33.061]  And by the way, they're at an incredible deal.
[02:33:33.101 --> 02:33:36.163]  Not only does he have them, he has them for less than you'll find them anywhere.
[02:33:36.403 --> 02:33:36.743]  Try.
[02:33:37.143 --> 02:33:38.304]  Ted, tell them the price you've got.
[02:33:38.424 --> 02:33:38.844]  Yeah, sure.
[02:33:38.924 --> 02:33:48.131]  Right now, actually, I had somebody call me just earlier trying to figure out what to buy, and we're talking 194 for the French Franc, and we also have the British Sovereign Gold right now at 239.
[02:33:48.211 --> 02:34:06.665]  The Plunge Protection Team is in there today pushing the stock market up from 700 points down this morning, and they're pushing gold down, and I'm watching this, and I'm like, wow, I'm going to take on another position, and it's almost to the point, it's got to drop about another 20 bucks, and I'll be able to get locked in at the same price I did last
[02:34:07.205 --> 02:34:17.832]  Last Friday, but I don't think I'm going to get it, but I'm going to take another position on it because they're going to be tripping over themselves trying to close down the markets, the world markets, on Monday and change the rules on how
