[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.810]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:00:26.787 --> 00:00:37.531]  As we are every day in the fourth hour, some days we do the whole show, other days two or three hours, but always at least one hour a day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:38.271]  I'm feeling good.
[00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:41.292]  I'm getting over that chest cold I've had the last four or five days.
[00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:43.393]  And we're taking your phone calls.
[00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.153]  I've covered a whole lot of issues.
[00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:50.675]  I mean, the private banks are saying we've taken trillions of dollars out of the Treasury, taxpayer money.
[00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:52.976]  We're not going to tell you who we gave it to.
[00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.770]  They're calling that transparency.
[00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:00.154]  They got this new Bretton Woods agreement coming up.
[00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:14.729]  Out of that framework, Lord Rothschild, the head of the Rothschild family, is in the major newspaper saying, and I'm going to show that to folks on the document cam later in the show, openly saying,
[00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:21.512]  That they're setting up a new world order and that it's a global government.
[00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:24.417]  That the new world order is global government.
[00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:28.047]  I think you're probably aware of Obama's use of NLP techniques in his speeches.
[00:01:54.744 --> 00:02:11.255]  Yeah, you know, I'm not an expert on any one area of mind control, but I've seen the TV shows about NLP, I know it's real, and I know that clearly, from the experts I've talked to in NLP, he is doing that, and then there's a lot of other mind control going on in the background, but absolutely.
[00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:21.046]  There's an article on wimps.com right now, an examination of Obama's use of hidden hypnosis techniques in his speeches.
[00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:22.908]  It's like 67 pages long.
[00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:25.190]  Yeah, we posted that a few weeks ago.
[00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.271]  It's a must-read.
[00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:33.336]  It's an absolute must-read to understand how satanically manipulative this man is.
[00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:35.477]  He's very dangerous.
[00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:42.803]  And he's going to be, who knows what sort of tricks he's going to be playing, because he talked about this
[00:02:47.008 --> 00:03:00.293]  Yeah, and they will point the mobs of dumbed-down fluoride heads at the mental clash when this revolution comes.
[00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:02.254]  It's not going to be against the bankers.
[00:03:02.654 --> 00:03:09.356]  You know, the public thinks it's somebody who's got a car and a two-bedroom house is the elite.
[00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:11.617]  No, they think anybody with five dollars is the elite.
[00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:24.114]  Yeah, and another thing I wanted to know is, there's a bill on the floor of Congress right now, from what I understand of it, for a draft of people 18-49, you're probably aware of that too, right?
[00:03:24.334 --> 00:03:38.059]  Yeah, they've been reintroducing that for the last decade under Congressman Rangel, and then he's got 50-something co-sponsors, last time I checked, and people just say, we're lying, it doesn't exist, even as Barack Obama announces they want to push it.
[00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:42.557]  Well, what are your plans to do when they... because you're in that age group, Alex.
[00:03:42.937 --> 00:03:44.018]  What are you going to do?
[00:03:44.838 --> 00:03:46.759]  Well, I'm not going to be joining.
[00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.119]  I'm not anybody's slave.
[00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.800]  And I'm not going to be part of any tattletale squad.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.282]  But see, they're going to find lots of folks that want to wear black uniforms and want to spy on their neighbors.
[00:03:56.662 --> 00:04:00.043]  That's why we told you they'd have checkpoints and bus stops and trains and...
[00:04:01.563 --> 00:04:27.933]  Yeah, it's shocking to me that a group of all these millions of people could be convinced to vote for a man who has no accomplishments in his life, and even a cursory examination of his past shows involvement with all sorts of
[00:04:31.048 --> 00:04:34.731]  Well, still, he's a puppet, and it's shocking to people this could happen.
[00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:36.132]  I appreciate your call.
[00:04:36.153 --> 00:04:37.193]  He doesn't run anything.
[00:04:37.253 --> 00:04:38.074]  He's a nobody.
[00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:41.917]  The reason he's dangerous is because, again, he's a puppet.
[00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:45.601]  They will blame everything the Newell Order does for the next four to eight years on him.
[00:04:46.221 --> 00:05:05.993]  Then the New World Order will get a new lease on life with a new puppet and then we'll learn that that puppet's bad because they worked for the bankers and not us and then there'll be another puppet and then we'll have to learn that's a bad puppet but then we'll accept the new puppet as not being a puppet and then we'll find out they're a puppet and then they'll give us a new person and we'll be fooled by that and take a few years to figure out they're a puppet.
[00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.134]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:09.215]  Hello, this is Steve Shane.
[00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:13.269]  The economic disaster is taking food out of the mouths of our families.
[00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.552]  Farmers, food brokers, and grocery stores can't get credit to supply your food.
[00:05:18.092 --> 00:05:21.214]  Over a third of us can't afford to buy food and pay our other expenses.
[00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:24.596]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or canceled.
[00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:30.840]  Last year, the eFoodsDirect Holiday Food Unit was a fun and exciting one-year supply with a great price.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.264]  This year, to quickly complete our food supply preparations, eFoodsDirect has created a very serious holiday unit.
[00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:45.334]  This super supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has more food.
[00:05:45.934 --> 00:05:49.216]  Safe food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries.
[00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:53.417]  For delivery by Christmas, orders must be submitted by the end of November.
[00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:57.599]  Good food is a gift of life and love this holiday season.
[00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.419]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:13.813]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.155]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:17.856]  But who is the enemy?
[00:06:18.356 --> 00:06:18.896]  Bin Laden.
[00:06:19.357 --> 00:06:20.137]  This is his MO.
[00:06:20.157 --> 00:06:21.498]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:21.538 --> 00:06:23.199]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:30.284]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:06:30.684 --> 00:06:31.124]  Some U.S.
[00:06:31.164 --> 00:06:36.848]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:06:37.508 --> 00:06:40.949]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.990]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.864]  Fuel prices are up and down, biting into everyone's budget.
[00:07:11.344 --> 00:07:14.847]  If you're ready to start saving at the pump, Fuel Saver technologies can help.

[00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:12.445]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:15.086]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:38.412]  Eight minutes, twenty-five seconds into this fourth and final hour.
[00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:48.434]  Larry Pratt to discuss the record gun sales, smashing all previous records nationwide as people go out and buy up guns in anticipation of more gun control.
[00:08:48.454 --> 00:08:52.435]  But that'll come after the controlled economic implosion, the controlled rioting
[00:08:54.133 --> 00:09:20.114]  uh... the troops on the streets see the globalists know how to the social engineers know how to make you beg for their tyranny uh... but uh... right now let's go back to your calls and quickly alex in new york you're on the air welcome what alex okay we're gonna let him go urban atlanta you're on the air go ahead the alex jones show hello sir go ahead
[00:09:21.454 --> 00:09:24.556]  Hey, Muppets and puppets and demons, oh my!
[00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:26.477]  You're covering it all today, buddy!
[00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:29.019]  But you know something, Alex?
[00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:35.263]  I'm getting physically ill looking at all politicians except Ron Paul.
[00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.365]  Let me say something about Ron Paul right quick.
[00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:48.491]  I read in an article that he made a passionate plea on the floor of the House of Representatives to get rid of the Federal Reserve System, to repeal the Federal Reserve Act.
[00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:49.992]  He also called for their arrest!
[00:09:51.112 --> 00:09:51.412]  Go ahead.
[00:09:51.592 --> 00:09:58.998]  He also called for their arrest a month ago on this show, and the general public's still not... We have to have that idea in our head.
[00:09:59.018 --> 00:10:01.880]  These are criminals that engineered this banking collapse.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.881]  They shouldn't be given more power.
[00:10:05.642 --> 00:10:06.523]  Absolutely not.
[00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:14.869]  I think it's utterly pathetic that these people are now claiming that they have some kind of sovereign authority that
[00:10:16.228 --> 00:10:20.891]  They're above the law, and all of this crap was set up during a lame duck session of Congress.
[00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:25.995]  I've tried to tell people this, yet they control everything about the U.S.
[00:10:26.035 --> 00:10:27.556]  economy, and you know what?
[00:10:27.897 --> 00:10:41.527]  That is why our government, as you say, is basically corrupt and illegitimate, because the inter-share politicians, they are elected based on what they're willing to do for the Federal Reserve System.
[00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:48.186]  And I want to ask you a quick question about Barkey Obama before I ask you about Rambo Emanuel.
[00:10:48.226 --> 00:10:54.355]  Now, do you think that the CIA is going to somehow magically produce a copy of his birth certificate?
[00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:58.000]  And if they do that, what about his medical records that have been sealed?
[00:10:59.929 --> 00:11:01.371]  You know, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:06.197]  In a way, whether he's an American or not, I'm not saying it's a distraction or a diversion.
[00:11:06.237 --> 00:11:07.359]  It's a substantive issue.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.084]  But it becomes a red herring from just the issues he supports.
[00:11:11.484 --> 00:11:14.288]  Total banker, takeover of the society,
[00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:30.204]  uh... domestic uh... drafts police squads tattletale squads carbon taxes that will fully bankrupt our economy and that will make more carbon be produced because it will make all the industry go to india and china where they have no
[00:11:31.185 --> 00:11:32.505]  carbon restrictions.
[00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:53.770]  I mean, even if you believe that carbon dioxide is a deadly chemical weapon that must be banned, oh goodness, plants breathe it, which of course is pure bull, but let's just say that's true, then why would you do what the government studies show would actually increase the overall output of CO2, because it'll just cause it to move to the third world nations that aren't under this.
[00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:54.630]  This is a tax.
[00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:55.750]  This is control.
[00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.251]  So that's why I'm really most against Barack Obama.
[00:12:00.534 --> 00:12:16.946]  When you were talking with Jack McLam about the female preachers, he mentioned that when the government goes after, I want you all to hear me very well, when the government goes after the Second Amendment, then that's when they will get their war for the damn Republic.
[00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:21.509]  Now, it's time to have Jack McLam back on.
[00:12:22.273 --> 00:12:29.654]  Because now this is exactly what these propagandist, illegitimate demons are talking about through this Rambo Emanuel.
[00:12:29.974 --> 00:12:31.195]  Who gave him this name?
[00:12:31.215 --> 00:12:33.215]  The name Emanuel means God with us.
[00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:38.516]  We've got dressed up demons amongst us, Alex, as far as these politicians are concerned.
[00:12:38.676 --> 00:12:39.896]  That's my honest assessment.
[00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:45.237]  Yeah, Ram Emanuel means high with God or in the high place with God.
[00:12:45.257 --> 00:12:46.417]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:12:47.637 --> 00:12:51.178]  I want to go through some news here in a minute and also show it to you here on the document cam.
[00:12:52.683 --> 00:12:53.644]  But we'll do that later.
[00:12:53.684 --> 00:12:55.344]  Let's continue with your calls right now.
[00:12:56.285 --> 00:13:00.967]  Let's talk to Michelle in British Columbia.
[00:13:01.007 --> 00:13:01.687]  You're on the air.
[00:13:02.268 --> 00:13:04.008]  Actually, Michelle and Joe dropped off.
[00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:04.709]  Okay.
[00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:07.390]  These callers call in and they drop right off.
[00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.591]  Erin in Hawaii.
[00:13:09.651 --> 00:13:10.371]  You're on the air.
[00:13:11.632 --> 00:13:12.452]  Hi there, Alex.
[00:13:12.752 --> 00:13:13.052]  Hi.
[00:13:13.773 --> 00:13:15.474]  I really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:13:17.549 --> 00:13:27.215]  You give me a lot of incentive to contact the senators and the reps here in Hawaii and trying to explain to them what is going on.
[00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:36.540]  My husband and I called and we're completely against the bailout and basically we're just talking to their aides.
[00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:40.242]  I've got different reactions depending on which office.
[00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:44.285]  Everything from screaming back at me and hanging up on me to
[00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:49.588]  One of them saying that they will personally call me back on the 17th.
[00:13:52.409 --> 00:13:57.992]  Just trying to let them know, let my neighbors know here that we know what's going on.
[00:14:00.253 --> 00:14:02.214]  That all of this has been engineered.
[00:14:03.654 --> 00:14:05.615]  They want to take away our sovereignty.
[00:14:08.757 --> 00:14:09.397]  It's frightening.
[00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:16.731]  And here in Maui, it was very strange, you know, because Obama, you know, supposedly was born over on Oahu.
[00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:30.340]  And it's real funny because Governor Lingle here sealed his birth, supposedly sealed his birth records, and supposed to remain that way until after the election.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.283]  However, the issue just seemed to have been forgotten about, even locally here.
[00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:40.752]  And then I heard that the Kenyan government also was sealing things.
[00:14:42.693 --> 00:14:44.715]  Because possibly he was really bored in Kenya.
[00:14:44.775 --> 00:14:52.701]  Yes, they've been sealing and hiding it and acting very, very suspicious, which is never a good sign, is it?
[00:14:53.522 --> 00:14:54.322]  Oh, no, sir.
[00:14:54.783 --> 00:14:55.263]  No, sir.
[00:14:55.743 --> 00:14:59.286]  There's no reason for the governor to seal something like that.
[00:15:00.547 --> 00:15:06.592]  Just the fact that she said they were sealing it is really, to me, an omission that
[00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.911]  He really isn't a citizen.
[00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:22.716]  The private school that he went to, Oahu, here, I forget the name of it, it's in Hawaii, but Honoho, I think, it's like $15,000 a year.
[00:15:22.736 --> 00:15:30.900]  You know, how could his family have afforded, you know, if he was a single mom on food stamps and this and that?
[00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:32.557]  No, no.
[00:15:32.837 --> 00:15:36.739]  The guy is a foundation creation from day one.
[00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:38.780]  I appreciate your call.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.301]  Good to hear from you.
[00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:47.344]  We're going to take more calls coming up, and we're going to have Larry Pratt on with us, but it was good to hear from you, Aaron, in Hawaii.
[00:15:49.145 --> 00:15:51.467]  Here's that Bloomberg report I talked about yesterday.
[00:15:52.717 --> 00:15:56.480]  Fed defies transparency aim and refusal to identify bank loans.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:04.365]  Then it says 2 trillion of emergency loans for American taxpayers and the troubled assets the central bank is accepting as collateral.
[00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:06.266]  And they're just saying it's secret.
[00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:08.688]  But everybody keeps talking about 700 billion.
[00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:14.572]  That's a distractionary amount that they are talking about there.
[00:16:15.152 --> 00:16:17.414]  So they are really throwing this in our face.
[00:16:18.174 --> 00:16:18.915]  Here's one.
[00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:22.357]  This was reported in the German and Austrian newspapers.
[00:16:23.618 --> 00:16:37.085]  The University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna did a study with mice and found that it sterilized them and lowered their birth weights and caused all sorts of problems with just one type of Monsanto maize.
[00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:42.948]  So I wanted to show that to everybody who's watching at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:51.913]  The headline there, of course, is genetically modified maize lowers fertility in mice study finds
[00:16:53.404 --> 00:16:56.246]  This is one of the big newspapers over in the United Arab Emirates.
[00:16:57.347 --> 00:16:58.087]  It's the National.
[00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:11.516]  And they had a big global meeting on the future of banking there last week, or over the weekend, and guess who was there?
[00:17:12.897 --> 00:17:13.477]  This guy,
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:20.083]  Baron David Rothschild, the head of the Rothschild Bank.
[00:17:20.103 --> 00:17:24.865]  The Rothschilds have helped the British government since financing Wellington's army to fight the French in 1815.
[00:17:25.445 --> 00:17:28.547]  That's actually when they bankrupted it by design.
[00:17:28.907 --> 00:17:41.614]  And they actually admit that in the article, and say that this guy basically runs world banking, and they have him bragging about how they're setting up a New World Order world government,
[00:17:43.772 --> 00:18:09.706]  out of this crisis the first barons of banking is that headline for everybody out there that wants to check it out and then you can open it up to the second page and it gets into the new world order it gets into global government it's all right there in the article uh... for anybody that uh...
[00:18:11.618 --> 00:18:12.499]  that wants to read it.
[00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:15.703]  It's all there for the people that want to see it.
[00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:19.106]  So there's that report.
[00:18:20.528 --> 00:18:22.810]  Continuing, Russia is rejecting U.S.
[00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:29.418]  missile proposals, and that's out of Reuters.
[00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:49.284]  The United States and NATO have moved all sorts of weapons systems and systems to shoot down Russian missiles right up against their border in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Georgia, and NATO admits in its doctrine... That was a good move there.
[00:18:50.065 --> 00:18:53.827]  I've still got a cold here a little bit, folks, so bear with me.
[00:18:58.649 --> 00:19:00.170]  We're going to punch this up on screen.
[00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.491]  Here you go.
[00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:02.992]  Russia rejects U.S.
[00:19:03.132 --> 00:19:04.153]  missile proposal.
[00:19:04.713 --> 00:19:06.674]  The Kremlin on Wednesday rejected U.S.
[00:19:07.935 --> 00:19:19.763]  proposals aimed at easing concerns over a missile defense system in Europe and said it would try again to resolve the fight once Barack Obama is in the White House.
[00:19:22.345 --> 00:19:23.606]  Russia says the planned U.S.
[00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:27.509]  system will threaten its national security under the administration of George Bush
[00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:42.319]  which leaves office in January has failed to allay its concerns and then they in an asinine fashion come out and say
[00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:48.121]  That it's for Iran to fight terrorists.
[00:19:48.542 --> 00:19:51.324]  So they're just stirring up wars with Russia.
[00:19:52.165 --> 00:19:57.430]  By the way, Barack Obama has announced he's going to have lobbyists in his administration and donors.
[00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:05.818]  That was all lies, and he's not getting rid of Guantanamo Bay, and he's not getting out of Iraq, and he's not getting rid of torture, and he's not getting rid of warrantless wiretapping.
[00:20:07.774 --> 00:20:13.356]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators, starting at $299.
[00:20:14.016 --> 00:20:27.741]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:31.202]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[00:20:31.502 --> 00:20:35.984]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[00:20:36.264 --> 00:20:36.565]  I think so.
[00:20:51.141 --> 00:20:54.423]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:20:54.483 --> 00:20:55.463]  And we knew what to do.
[00:21:15.657 --> 00:21:16.718]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:21:16.918 --> 00:21:23.346]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:32.477]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:21:32.864 --> 00:21:39.667]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:43.008]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:21:43.128 --> 00:21:48.330]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:51.532]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:21:51.972 --> 00:21:58.955]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at
[00:22:01.647 --> 00:22:01.968]  We're good to go.
[00:22:07.583 --> 00:22:10.964]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:22:11.104 --> 00:22:16.326]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:21.288]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:22:21.668 --> 00:22:32.792]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:22:33.192 --> 00:22:38.737]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:45.022]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:22:45.222 --> 00:22:45.883]  What about you?

[00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:18.702]  Garden in a Can.

[00:23:37.659 --> 00:23:38.660]  Garden in a Can.

[00:24:17.825 --> 00:24:20.366]  Alright, we're live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:20.466 --> 00:24:22.247]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:24:22.827 --> 00:24:25.288]  Going out on the AM and FM dial, global shortwave of the internet.
[00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:31.670]  Don't forget the free podcast downloaded by over 105,000 people a day and growing Monday through Sunday.
[00:24:33.098 --> 00:24:34.698]  Only day off is Saturday.
[00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:37.359]  Free podcast, six days a week.
[00:24:37.379 --> 00:24:39.840]  Listen to how you want, where you want, when you want.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.241]  Very thankful to all the listeners and people that love liberty and hate tyranny.
[00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:49.562]  Okay, we've got a lot of callers here, and I got my callers scrambled earlier.
[00:24:49.902 --> 00:24:51.682]  Who's been holding the longest here, John?
[00:24:52.703 --> 00:24:53.663]  Michelle in B.C.
[00:24:53.683 --> 00:24:54.063]  Colbert.
[00:24:54.323 --> 00:24:56.024]  Okay, Michelle in B.C.
[00:24:56.084 --> 00:24:57.104]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:24:58.944 --> 00:24:59.464]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:59.584 --> 00:24:59.804]  Hi.
[00:24:59.864 --> 00:25:01.925]  I hope you're feeling better.
[00:25:02.905 --> 00:25:07.787]  And I've been awakened to all this only for about six months and I'm 43 years old.
[00:25:08.588 --> 00:25:11.849]  I should have had this information much sooner in my life.
[00:25:12.109 --> 00:25:15.510]  Anyways, I also want to mention I just recently subscribed to your show.
[00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:16.551]  I bought some new videos.
[00:25:16.991 --> 00:25:18.492]  I'm planning on buying more for Christmas.
[00:25:18.612 --> 00:25:20.473]  This will be my Christmas gift to people.
[00:25:21.733 --> 00:25:30.497]  But one thing I wanted to ask you about is up here Canadians tend, I don't know, they think that the Bank of Canada
[00:25:31.084 --> 00:25:33.165]  is controlled by the government of Canada.
[00:25:34.005 --> 00:25:43.087]  And in the research I've done, back in I think it was 72, all of that was turned over to the same thugs.
[00:25:43.267 --> 00:25:49.709]  Actually, Mark Carney is the governor of the Bank of Canada, who served as director for Goldman Sachs.
[00:25:49.749 --> 00:25:56.331]  Yes, the Bank of Canada has governmental power, but its profits are private.
[00:25:56.711 --> 00:25:57.951]  And it is a private
[00:25:59.198 --> 00:26:06.725]  Chartered Bank, just like in 1913, our Federal Reserve, our parasite, you know, it's like my cancer.
[00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:08.407]  You know, I talk about it possessively.
[00:26:08.807 --> 00:26:11.710]  It's not our military, it's not our police, it's the New World Orders.
[00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.073]  I'm not saying they're individually bad, but the system itself is evil.
[00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:19.898]  So I have to semantically myself reprogram myself to really use proper terms.
[00:26:21.101 --> 00:26:29.604]  But the Federal Reserve is private, and the Bank of England is private, the Bundesbank is private, and it is the same families that own it.
[00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:32.526]  It's the Dutch, the British Royalty, the Rothschilds.
[00:26:32.866 --> 00:26:36.647]  It's less than 20 families that own the shares in these.
[00:26:37.087 --> 00:26:39.649]  Let me play you, in case you missed it in the first hour.
[00:26:39.709 --> 00:26:40.589]  I said I'd play this again.
[00:26:40.989 --> 00:26:42.910]  This is two nights ago, Laird NewsHour.
[00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:45.131]  This is Alan Greenspan saying,
[00:26:45.891 --> 00:26:56.459]  But saying it's a good thing that the Federal Reserve isn't under Congress, the President, it is an agency unto itself with no oversight as if that is the American way.
[00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:58.600]  No checks and balances, here it is.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:06.906]  What is the proper relationship, what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:15.192]  Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that there is no
[00:27:16.138 --> 00:27:16.559]  I don't know.
[00:27:32.134 --> 00:27:40.737]  is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:27:40.957 --> 00:27:44.418]  And I've had very good relationships with the President.
[00:27:44.618 --> 00:27:56.783]  Alright, amazing spin, implying with semantics it's federal but never saying it, and then saying that as long as government has no oversight, as long as government
[00:27:57.563 --> 00:27:58.564]  Has no say.
[00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:00.064]  The Fed is legitimate.
[00:28:00.304 --> 00:28:01.825]  You can go watch the whole clip online.
[00:28:02.185 --> 00:28:02.966]  It's like five minutes.
[00:28:03.646 --> 00:28:05.827]  But, I mean, it's a private group.
[00:28:05.907 --> 00:28:09.209]  They control the issuance of currency, and liquidity, and credit.
[00:28:09.249 --> 00:28:19.514]  They can cut it off, then terrorize the Congress into giving their private banks trillions of dollars, and then they tell us, we said you could look at what we did, but we're not going to tell you anything we did.
[00:28:19.814 --> 00:28:20.714]  It's all secret.
[00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:24.356]  So, it's a new level of corruption, Michelle.
[00:28:25.464 --> 00:28:30.630]  Alex, I get that and it sounds like a lot of Americans are starting to get that.
[00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.834]  The issue for me is Canadians just aren't buying it.
[00:28:34.934 --> 00:28:40.220]  I'm fully aware of this and when I post comments on cbc.ca
[00:28:41.465 --> 00:28:46.911]  You know, there'll be like ten pages of replies and only about three posters there where you can see, get it.
[00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:50.514]  Well, that's because they're invested in the system.
[00:28:50.734 --> 00:28:51.455]  They're in denial.
[00:28:51.775 --> 00:28:53.257]  They're invested in the system.
[00:28:53.597 --> 00:28:56.160]  They don't want to admit bad people are robbing them.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.162]  And so they just say, it's not true.
[00:28:59.443 --> 00:29:06.470]  As things get worse and worse, they're going to remember what you said in British Columbia, Michelle.
[00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.812]  They're going to remember what I said in Austin, Texas.
[00:29:08.832 --> 00:29:13.197]  They're going to remember what people said in London, and Germany, and Japan, and Russia, and Mexico.
[00:29:14.258 --> 00:29:15.980]  And there are more people taking action.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:16.901]  I appreciate your call.
[00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:19.063]  So just continue on warning them.
[00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:21.485]  They're going to laugh, but later they're going to remember.
[00:29:23.499 --> 00:29:27.643]  I keep meaning to plug this, and by plug it, I mean I want to just commend these guys.
[00:29:27.683 --> 00:29:38.874]  There are so many 9-11 truth groups, so many We Are Change groups, so many groups doing yeoman's work of getting involved, confronting politicians, getting out there and educating people.
[00:29:39.474 --> 00:29:42.977]  Getting out there and getting off their butts and turning the tide.
[00:29:43.337 --> 00:29:44.939]  And we are Change San Antonio.
[00:29:44.979 --> 00:29:46.500]  We posted some of their videos yesterday.
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.402]  The persecution they're going through.
[00:29:48.422 --> 00:29:52.545]  I want to salute those three young men down there in San Antonio, Texas.
[00:29:53.086 --> 00:29:53.686]  Great job.
[00:29:54.006 --> 00:29:55.728]  We'll be right back with Larry Prett.
[00:29:57.369 --> 00:29:58.250]  We're on the march.
[00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.252]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:01.264 --> 00:30:04.025]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.265 --> 00:30:06.886]  Yeah, I'm going to keep going and go ahead and talk to John during the break.
[00:30:07.286 --> 00:30:08.146]  Hey, John?
[00:30:09.146 --> 00:30:09.466]  Yes, sir?
[00:30:10.086 --> 00:30:13.967]  Have you got Pratt on ISDN line?
[00:30:14.407 --> 00:30:17.948]  Yep, I'm going to have to disconnect the backup line and then connect him right now on that.
[00:30:18.949 --> 00:30:19.589]  Alright, great.
[00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:21.449]  And then go ahead and get his audio up and everything.
[00:30:21.489 --> 00:30:22.810]  He always has it low.
[00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.571]  And we'll talk to everybody out there.
[00:30:28.853 --> 00:30:29.495]  Okay, pal.
[00:30:30.278 --> 00:30:30.599]  Thanks.
[00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:31.723]  Sure, no problem.
[00:30:43.823 --> 00:30:46.506]  Use them and love them, knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:30:46.786 --> 00:30:47.887]  And I say big time.

[00:31:07.208 --> 00:31:13.572]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:31:13.952 --> 00:31:15.933]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:31:16.594 --> 00:31:17.634]  But who is the enemy?
[00:31:18.135 --> 00:31:18.655]  Bin Laden.
[00:31:18.935 --> 00:31:19.856]  This is his ammo.
[00:31:19.876 --> 00:31:21.237]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:31:21.297 --> 00:31:22.958]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:30.042]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:31:30.442 --> 00:31:30.882]  Some U.S.
[00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:36.606]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:31:37.266 --> 00:31:40.789]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:51.017]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:31:51.237 --> 00:31:51.998]  Fabled enemies.

[00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:10.167]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:10.948 --> 00:32:16.574]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:32:16.614 --> 00:32:17.354]  Supreme Court.
[00:32:18.135 --> 00:32:22.439]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:32:22.479 --> 00:32:26.123]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:32:27.064 --> 00:32:32.289]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[00:33:28.474 --> 00:33:31.214]  There is more and more guerrilla media taking place.
[00:33:31.814 --> 00:33:36.335]  Somebody put out 1.5 million fake New York Post papers.
[00:33:36.355 --> 00:33:38.396]  Must have been a big organization.
[00:33:39.796 --> 00:33:42.297]  With the headline, Iraq War Over.
[00:33:43.957 --> 00:33:44.877]  Bush Arrested.
[00:33:47.238 --> 00:33:52.499]  And it's those type of things that will shock people out of their catatonic state.
[00:33:54.690 --> 00:34:10.323]  Getting my films, my books, my videos, the materials we carry, getting them out to people, making copies of them, other materials, other information, starting your own local radio show, starting a website, a blog, an audio blog, a video blog, fighting for internet freedom.
[00:34:12.044 --> 00:34:18.069]  In fact, let's punch up the PrisonPlanet.tv document cam.
[00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:21.632]  I want to show folks shots of the New York Times.
[00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:27.052]  The guys were telling me about it during the break, reading me the headline.
[00:34:27.072 --> 00:34:28.532]  They told me the New York Post for some reason.
[00:34:28.772 --> 00:34:31.232]  It's the New York Times, so that's why I ran in and told you about this.
[00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:32.433]  But here it is.
[00:34:33.193 --> 00:34:34.353]  The New York Times.
[00:34:35.413 --> 00:34:37.394]  Iraq War Ends.
[00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:43.955]  And they've got, again, all these other fake headlines there.
[00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:44.955]  Let's read some of them here.
[00:34:46.015 --> 00:34:49.296]  It says, Nation sets its sights on
[00:34:53.123 --> 00:34:54.583]  Building sane economy.
[00:34:55.624 --> 00:34:57.484]  Treasury announces true cost.
[00:34:58.704 --> 00:34:59.504]  Tax plan.
[00:35:00.185 --> 00:35:01.185]  Popular pressure.
[00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:03.225]  Bolsters.
[00:35:03.805 --> 00:35:04.866]  Recent progressive.
[00:35:06.006 --> 00:35:09.027]  It's so small I can't read all of it in the screenshot of it.
[00:35:12.187 --> 00:35:14.888]  Ex-Secretary apologizes for WMD scare.
[00:35:18.942 --> 00:35:19.863]  So it goes on and on.
[00:35:20.563 --> 00:35:24.206]  This is obviously from a liberal bent, which you're not going to get from Barack Obama.
[00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:27.048]  You're going to get more wars, more corporate looting.
[00:35:27.068 --> 00:35:29.650]  He's saying he's now going to have lobbyists in his administration.
[00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:32.112]  He's saying that torture is going to continue.
[00:35:32.932 --> 00:35:35.274]  He's saying Guantanamo is going to stay open for now.
[00:35:35.694 --> 00:35:38.757]  The troops are going to stay there for 18 months before he looks at it again.
[00:35:39.717 --> 00:35:41.799]  He's saying wiretapping will continue.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.301]  In fact, it's all over the news here today.
[00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:49.807]  Obama's bailout bunch brings us more of the same.
[00:35:50.307 --> 00:35:52.829]  That's out of Bloomberg Financial today.
[00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.532]  And that's exactly what he's doing.
[00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:02.355]  Most in AP poll confident Obama will fix economy.
[00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:05.297]  But I went and looked up the actual poll, not just the AP article.
[00:36:05.317 --> 00:36:07.398]  I went and looked it up by the folks that did it.
[00:36:07.758 --> 00:36:11.341]  They only asked registered Republicans and Democrats who had voted in the election.
[00:36:13.024 --> 00:36:15.606]  And so, you know, that's 30-40% of the public.
[00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:17.427]  Well, almost 40% of the public that didn't vote.
[00:36:17.687 --> 00:36:18.568]  They didn't ask them.
[00:36:19.509 --> 00:36:23.552]  But 70% believe Obama will try to fix the economy.
[00:36:24.552 --> 00:36:25.913]  I mean, that's just ridiculous.
[00:36:26.494 --> 00:36:31.798]  Now, if you research into this more, the majority of the public think the economy is going to get worse.
[00:36:34.094 --> 00:36:35.016]  That's the thing with polls.
[00:36:35.036 --> 00:36:37.960]  You've got to look at them from different angles.
[00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:40.464]  Here's an inter-press service report.
[00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:42.006]  Obama's foreign policy.
[00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:43.288]  No sharp break from Bush.
[00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.572]  As more companies seek aid.
[00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:49.404]  Where do the bailouts stop?
[00:36:49.484 --> 00:36:51.225]  Well, we haven't had real bailouts of U.S.
[00:36:51.265 --> 00:36:54.927]  companies or actual manufacturing or people's mortgages.
[00:36:54.987 --> 00:36:55.568]  And I'm against it.
[00:36:56.168 --> 00:36:57.188]  By the way, it's socialism.
[00:36:57.909 --> 00:36:58.990]  This isn't even socialism.
[00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.911]  This is just foreign banks looting us of over $2 trillion.
[00:37:02.932 --> 00:37:10.937]  But I'm going to shut up about that and go to Larry Pratt for just one segment because we've had record gun sales in the country.
[00:37:12.447 --> 00:37:16.849]  Breaking all of the instant background check records the FBI says.
[00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:20.671]  Gun shops everywhere are almost sold out or sold out.
[00:37:21.111 --> 00:37:26.294]  Most types of semi-autos that Obama wants to go after are there.
[00:37:26.534 --> 00:37:31.977]  But I thought we'd get Larry Pratt on just briefly to talk about what the real threat is and how they're going to do this by stealth.
[00:37:34.901 --> 00:37:40.125]  Where Barack Obama and his Chief of Staff really do stand on the Second Amendment.
[00:37:40.165 --> 00:37:44.428]  He wants a 500% tax on firearms.
[00:37:44.508 --> 00:37:46.029]  So if a gun cost $100, they would add $500 on it.
[00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:53.061]  They want to ban .50 cals, they want to restrict .308, .223.
[00:37:54.162 --> 00:37:56.283]  So they've said that they want to shut down gun shows.
[00:37:56.963 --> 00:38:02.227]  They are coming for your guns, but they've got to stage a mass shooting first, or hype one up.
[00:38:02.387 --> 00:38:05.669]  Larry Pratt, head of Gunners of America, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:38:06.469 --> 00:38:07.810]  Alex, thank you for having me.
[00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:09.651]  I think you're absolutely correct.
[00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:19.137]  In many ways, I would imagine Obama being a Marxist thug right out of Chicago politics.
[00:38:19.918 --> 00:38:21.859]  Not to mention his Kenya connections.
[00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:23.240]  He's going to go for it.
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.521]  He's going to go for a lot of different things.
[00:38:26.201 --> 00:38:27.582]  Not speaking of guns at the moment.
[00:38:29.403 --> 00:38:35.426]  Especially I would imagine he's going to go after changing further the voting rules to further
[00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.752]  Keep his group of Marxists in power.
[00:38:38.952 --> 00:38:50.279]  Now again, the bankers put him in because the bankers, as Carol Quigley and others said, they like Marxists because they'll destroy the middle class, the competition of the elite, and hand all that money and power and real estate over to them.
[00:38:50.619 --> 00:38:53.041]  And so if you really look at what he's doing, he's coming after the middle class.
[00:38:53.341 --> 00:38:55.922]  His carbon tax will destroy the middle class.
[00:38:56.162 --> 00:39:03.307]  That'll produce poverty and unhappiness, and by changing the voting rules, they will be able to contain
[00:39:04.005 --> 00:39:09.890]  Any voting uprising that might occur, people standing in line all day for a loaf of bread.
[00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.353]  All we have to do is look at the Soviet Union, Cuba, other places.
[00:39:13.853 --> 00:39:16.835]  They don't have time to plan an election campaign or anything else.
[00:39:16.976 --> 00:39:20.779]  Yeah, I know you're a student, I mean you're a best-selling author and a student of history.
[00:39:21.239 --> 00:39:24.562]  Explain to people that communists aren't stupid.
[00:39:25.442 --> 00:39:27.104]  They always want to steal the wealth.
[00:39:27.224 --> 00:39:30.286]  They know that making you poor is a way to control you.
[00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:30.807]  Tell them about it.
[00:39:31.774 --> 00:39:37.938]  This has been a pattern that we have seen and I've had to conclude they really do know what they're doing.
[00:39:38.058 --> 00:39:39.519]  It is a control technique.
[00:39:39.959 --> 00:39:43.141]  Communism, socialism is not an economic theory.
[00:39:43.561 --> 00:39:49.605]  It's a political theory on how to rule, on how to maintain a monopoly of power.
[00:39:50.025 --> 00:39:56.689]  Now obviously guns being controlled by the government is part of it, but frankly I think they're going to have us on our knees before they
[00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:00.531]  Do something bold like even renewing the Clinton gun ban.
[00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:01.171]  Exactly.
[00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:04.531]  They're not going to try to bring in troops to the streets.
[00:40:04.731 --> 00:40:12.213]  They're all set up and locked and loaded until the economic system causes riots and degradation and then the public will beg for it.
[00:40:12.613 --> 00:40:13.413]  Will applaud.
[00:40:13.513 --> 00:40:14.433]  Exactly correct.
[00:40:14.773 --> 00:40:18.714]  I think that's exactly the scenario that they would seek.
[00:40:19.534 --> 00:40:24.135]  And all we have to do is look either in rules for radicals to see what
[00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:32.188]  His communist mentor, not a live mentor, but he read him, Saul Alinsky and Rules for Radicals.
[00:40:32.628 --> 00:40:42.455]  Or look at the way he collaborated with the takeover in Kenya, a power-sharing arrangement that had no constitutional basis.
[00:40:44.218 --> 00:40:50.623]  Victor in the election felt it was the only thing he could do to stop the mayhem, the killing of Christians in Kenya.
[00:40:50.723 --> 00:41:00.310]  And it turns out that Obama advised Odinga, and that's been documented in the emails, even mainstream news, on how to stage riots and kill people.
[00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.373]  So, I mean, this guy isn't playing games.
[00:41:04.653 --> 00:41:06.094]  No, he's not playing games.
[00:41:06.194 --> 00:41:12.799]  He's going to have the youth corps, the million man spy army, which is now admitted back in the... I mean, we're talking about hellish.
[00:41:13.419 --> 00:41:24.208]  So look for something to go through before his first two years that says that for a federal election you have to allow for election day registration.
[00:41:24.668 --> 00:41:38.780]  Of course, amnesty will produce a lot of new Democrat voters, and they might even go so far as to bring statehood for Puerto Rico and D.C., which means four new socialist senators right there.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.742]  That gives them closer and closer to a
[00:41:43.419 --> 00:41:45.520]  A defeat-proof majority.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:55.603]  It may be that a majority of the country will be opposed to them, but you won't be able to register that effectively in an acorn-driven election with all the new rules.
[00:41:55.983 --> 00:42:06.666]  And so then gun owners can... We're going to be faced, very likely, with the prospect of the rules being changed, the BATFE, the Federal Gun Police,
[00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:21.467]  Marching even worse than they are now under Bush against not only individual owners, but stores, and as you mentioned, gun shows I think will be the first legislative item up because the NRA has supported that.
[00:42:21.807 --> 00:42:23.748]  It was John McCain's legislation.
[00:42:24.248 --> 00:42:28.310]  It ultimately failed because they got greedy and had too many other things on it.
[00:42:28.631 --> 00:42:30.912]  But if they kept it to a pure gun show bill,
[00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:34.364]  They could get that through about any time they wanted.
[00:42:35.225 --> 00:42:37.746]  And that's what they want to stop is private sales.
[00:42:38.046 --> 00:42:42.309]  And the way they write these is a citizen won't be able to even sell one to his neighbor.
[00:42:42.649 --> 00:42:50.375]  That gives the BATF an end to go after their favorite target, the law-abiding citizen who wants it for self-defense.
[00:42:50.835 --> 00:42:53.457]  That's who they love to throw the book at, not the real criminals.
[00:42:53.757 --> 00:42:55.438]  And so then they can really
[00:42:55.778 --> 00:43:00.579]  Start going after people, seizing whole gun collections to, quote, track where they were bought.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.340]  You don't have a receipt for that.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.280]  Just hellish control.
[00:43:04.741 --> 00:43:06.441]  And we know it's not going to bother criminals.
[00:43:06.481 --> 00:43:08.842]  They've got this and more in England.
[00:43:09.442 --> 00:43:19.065]  And all they've gotten for their trouble is almost now three times the number of illegal guns in the country as were there when they confiscated them at the beginning of 1997.
[00:43:21.731 --> 00:43:31.075]  We are looking at a really bad ride, and I think this guy is dedicated enough to power.
[00:43:31.095 --> 00:43:40.198]  He's no Bill Clinton who at least had the quote-unquote redeeming virtue of having, shall we say, extracurricular interest.
[00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:41.639]  This guy's all business.
[00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:45.941]  He is a hard, core, hate-filled Marxist.
[00:43:46.434 --> 00:43:50.536]  Who really hates Western civilization, and America in particular.
[00:43:51.357 --> 00:43:52.817]  And his wife and he have said that.
[00:43:52.897 --> 00:43:53.898]  He is focused.
[00:43:54.238 --> 00:43:55.879]  He wants to destroy the middle class.
[00:43:56.159 --> 00:43:57.760]  He loves the internationalists.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.260]  He loves the bankers.
[00:43:59.661 --> 00:44:01.502]  He hates this country.
[00:44:01.662 --> 00:44:03.263]  There's no doubt about that.
[00:44:03.523 --> 00:44:07.084]  These internationalists, they hate the free market.
[00:44:07.305 --> 00:44:08.405]  And they can't wait.
[00:44:08.665 --> 00:44:10.886]  They say it on NPR.
[00:44:11.146 --> 00:44:13.107]  The spoiled, rotten consumers.
[00:44:13.428 --> 00:44:14.228]  The Americans.
[00:44:14.268 --> 00:44:15.789]  The carbon tax will teach you.
[00:44:17.296 --> 00:44:18.236]  That's exactly right.
[00:44:18.536 --> 00:44:27.058]  I mean, the misery it's going to cause poor folks to quote, bankrupt the coal plants and tax everything that's energy related to carbon.
[00:44:27.338 --> 00:44:28.219]  I mean, this is hellish.
[00:44:28.259 --> 00:44:28.879]  Go ahead, Larry.
[00:44:30.219 --> 00:44:36.601]  To them, it doesn't matter that they will kill the productive engine of the United States and probably the West.
[00:44:38.547 --> 00:44:41.388]  No, that they will always be able to live well.
[00:44:41.448 --> 00:44:44.028]  Look at, what's the guy's name in Korea?
[00:44:44.508 --> 00:44:46.129]  Kim Il-Soon or something like that?
[00:44:46.149 --> 00:44:47.089]  Oh, funny you mention him.
[00:44:47.129 --> 00:44:48.869]  Let me play a clip of him first.
[00:44:49.629 --> 00:44:53.710]  Come in with Kim Jong-Il introducing Hans Blix.
[00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:54.150]  Here it is.
[00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.171]  Hans Blix, oh no!
[00:45:01.956 --> 00:45:04.178]  All right, all right, all right.
[00:45:04.198 --> 00:45:04.478]  Okay, Hans.
[00:45:04.498 --> 00:45:06.580]  Hey, you liked him!
[00:45:23.908 --> 00:45:26.049]  I'm sorry, just a little bit of joking here.
[00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:27.009]  I meant to play that earlier.
[00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:34.791]  I'm not sad he's had a second stroke and that piece of filth who's murdered millions of his own people is probably going to die soon.
[00:45:35.231 --> 00:45:36.051]  Sorry, Larry, go ahead.
[00:45:36.472 --> 00:45:39.893]  Well, it hasn't stopped him, even though he's destroyed the middle class.
[00:45:39.913 --> 00:45:41.473]  They hardly produce anything.
[00:45:42.003 --> 00:45:52.311]  In North Korea, he lives perfectly luxuriously, or has, at least in the past, until his present illness, and that's the way socialists think.
[00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:55.273]  They look at economics as distribution.
[00:45:55.453 --> 00:46:07.863]  To the extent they believe their own propaganda, they look kind of like Michelle Obama, saying, well, we've got to take a piece of your pie and give it to somebody else who needs it more.
[00:46:09.169 --> 00:46:23.601]  It never occurs to them that the pie is going to be gone and there won't be anything to distribute, but they don't care because they will have attained power, total control for a very long period of time, and so doing.
[00:46:23.901 --> 00:46:29.186]  And of course they're going to come after the guns, but they're going to come after the guns someday when we're standing in line.
[00:46:29.266 --> 00:46:31.027]  I was talking to a guy from Bolivia.
[00:46:31.728 --> 00:46:33.269]  They're having terrible times down there.
[00:46:33.289 --> 00:46:36.712]  They have to get in line about one in the morning if they want a loaf of bread later in the day.
[00:46:40.287 --> 00:46:46.989]  Well, that's what these control freaks do, Larry Pratt, as you know, over and over again.
[00:46:47.009 --> 00:46:49.050]  I mean, that's like UNIDIR said on July 7, 2000.
[00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.532]  They said we must disarm the civilians to have the power monopoly of the state.
[00:46:54.832 --> 00:47:07.536]  To them, they understand that independent people that are middle class are the enemy, and it's the lower classes dumbed down, working for socialism, that give the power structure to the elite to destroy the middle class.
[00:47:07.596 --> 00:47:09.117]  Again, this is so central.
[00:47:09.157 --> 00:47:09.817]  Please continue.
[00:47:10.905 --> 00:47:18.390]  So, you know, if we're standing in line waiting for a loaf of bread since 1, 2 o'clock in the morning, they can come by our house and collect the guns.
[00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.411]  We won't even be there!
[00:47:21.152 --> 00:47:24.034]  That's metaphorically, or figuratively, that's how it's going to be.
[00:47:24.054 --> 00:47:28.137]  Yeah, you won't even have a house to be able to buy guns, or shoot them, or have a culture.
[00:47:28.697 --> 00:47:29.758]  I have to accept the point.
[00:47:29.798 --> 00:47:30.218]  You're right.
[00:47:31.079 --> 00:47:33.640]  There will be, and it may not happen right away.
[00:47:33.661 --> 00:47:34.961]  You can look at South Africa.
[00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:35.762]  It's been happening
[00:47:36.493 --> 00:47:42.352]  Little by little, but very steadily for a number of years since the Communists took over the African National Congress.
[00:47:43.165 --> 00:47:44.446]  That's what's coming.
[00:47:44.546 --> 00:47:55.709]  And by the way, they allow selective gangs in South Africa and other countries to kill and murder other African tribes, groups of whites, whites killing other whites, and it's left alone.
[00:47:56.129 --> 00:48:07.913]  I've seen two different videos, and I'm not in a bashing fest here, folks, but if a gay guy got punched in the face and had something taken away and stomped, say a rainbow flag, it'd be international top news.
[00:48:08.373 --> 00:48:10.574]  In California, a group of
[00:48:12.076 --> 00:48:29.904]  Protesters stormed a church, tore things apart, chanted against Jesus, and then on video, punched an old lady in the face, grabbed her cross away on news cameras, beat her up, and the news, it's up on InfoWars.com, says, well, there was a scuffle today.
[00:48:30.684 --> 00:48:36.387]  So, again, they're going to allow their people... And both sides were probably saying hateful things, I'm sure.
[00:48:36.627 --> 00:48:37.127]  No, they weren't.
[00:48:37.167 --> 00:48:42.269]  But the point is, is that they're going to allow selective thuggism.
[00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:43.750]  Exactly.
[00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.851]  Exactly.
[00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:50.033]  And they will actually blame the victim by saying it was the church that was speaking hateful stuff.
[00:48:51.073 --> 00:48:54.615]  And so that's why those poor homosexuals were provoked to do what they did.
[00:48:57.236 --> 00:49:00.637]  That's the world we're rapidly becoming part of.
[00:49:00.697 --> 00:49:04.459]  I mean, we've been dealing with a media that was skewered for some time.
[00:49:05.553 --> 00:49:12.782]  They try to make it seem as if we're in the middle of a big crime wave when we are not, but that's the way they can always sell gun control.
[00:49:12.802 --> 00:49:19.650]  Like you say, every time there's a big shooting, that's the next opportunity for grabbing some more guns.
[00:49:19.892 --> 00:49:26.556]  Well Larry Pratt, the silver lining here that I want you to speak to in closing is that 10 years ago, 20 years ago, we were in trouble.
[00:49:26.596 --> 00:49:27.437]  They were advancing.
[00:49:27.937 --> 00:49:39.484]  Now they're advancing covertly with manufacturing lawsuits, importation restrictions, buying up all the ammo, but they're not advancing overtly anymore.
[00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:44.067]  And that's why Handgun Control and others have said, well, we'll just brainwash your kids.
[00:49:44.087 --> 00:49:45.288]  They brag, we've got your kids.
[00:49:45.568 --> 00:49:46.708]  I've seen them brag and say that.
[00:49:47.029 --> 00:49:54.053]  So the good news is, these bastards are having to go more covert now, because we're winning the fight for the hearts and minds.
[00:49:55.093 --> 00:49:56.194]  Well, I hope that's right.
[00:49:56.434 --> 00:50:01.737]  And if it is, we may find that we're going to have to switch to satellite radio.
[00:50:01.777 --> 00:50:03.458]  You're already there, of course.
[00:50:04.279 --> 00:50:08.341]  But these guys could even come after the Internet through a treaty with the UN.
[00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:10.591]  There are so many stealth ways.
[00:50:11.011 --> 00:50:12.212]  We've only scratched the surface.
[00:50:12.432 --> 00:50:13.574]  Oh, I forgot to bring that up.
[00:50:13.634 --> 00:50:14.614]  Stay with us.
[00:50:14.795 --> 00:50:24.103]  Speaking of the internet, we won't be on the AM and FM dial in the shortwave, but during this three-minute break, just for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and hundreds of thousands listening on the web,
[00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:33.165]  And on the podcast, explain how they may try a UN treaty to do that, Larry Pratt.
[00:50:33.205 --> 00:50:39.250]  But before we end this segment, give people the website and toll-free number to find out more.
[00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:42.933]  GunOwners is at gunowners.org on the web.
[00:50:43.614 --> 00:50:46.156]  That's the best way to get us, gunowners.org.
[00:50:46.196 --> 00:50:50.559]  You can join there, you can get on our email alert, which is a freebie, gunowners.org.
[00:50:51.752 --> 00:51:00.479]  And you've also got the Bitter Clinger t-shirt, which we'll talk about behind the scenes right now for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:04.603]  Please stay with us, and then I'll be back in the final segment for everybody else.
[00:51:08.747 --> 00:51:12.049]  Okay Larry, get into the UN angle for folks.
[00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:18.375]  Well, for years they've been trying to get the United States looped into a treaty
[00:51:19.146 --> 00:51:23.909]  At the U.N., a small arms treaty is normally the way they call it.
[00:51:24.329 --> 00:51:28.632]  Well, small arms might sound military, and, hey, I don't have a military gun.
[00:51:28.672 --> 00:51:32.734]  I just have a semi-automatic handgun or hunting rifle.
[00:51:33.175 --> 00:51:38.898]  Well, believe me, that's what they mean by small arms, and that's the way they could come against us.
[00:51:38.918 --> 00:51:41.760]  They've got this very, very wrong
[00:51:42.316 --> 00:51:46.098]  notion that a treaty trumps anything in the Constitution.
[00:51:46.418 --> 00:51:49.379]  Actually, it only trumps something that the U.S.
[00:51:49.579 --> 00:51:53.120]  government had authority to enter into a treaty for to begin with.
[00:51:53.501 --> 00:51:55.902]  But they'll look at it as, oh, we got the treaty.
[00:51:55.982 --> 00:51:57.962]  Well, now we have to kiss off the Second Amendment.
[00:51:58.303 --> 00:51:59.123]  Sorry about that.
[00:51:59.283 --> 00:52:01.004]  Sorry about that D.C.
[00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:02.864]  decision that overturned gun bans.
[00:52:03.225 --> 00:52:03.765]  That was then.
[00:52:04.005 --> 00:52:04.605]  This is now.
[00:52:05.025 --> 00:52:06.046]  No more Second Amendment.
[00:52:06.646 --> 00:52:11.208]  And this is the way they've been advancing a lot of their agenda.
[00:52:11.721 --> 00:52:15.264]  For almost a hundred years, they started it with migratory birds.
[00:52:15.624 --> 00:52:20.148]  Oh, we can't keep you from hunting migratory birds with the national law?
[00:52:20.469 --> 00:52:23.411]  Okay, we'll get a treaty with Canada and then we'll stuff it right down your throat.
[00:52:23.531 --> 00:52:36.782]  Or they are now going to list carbon dioxide as a deadly toxic poison, not one of the four main elements of life on the planet, and then by claiming polar bears are endangered, which they're at record levels, forty-something thousand just in
[00:52:38.453 --> 00:52:42.097]  Yeah, I guess I must have been dreaming when I saw the videos of polar bears in the Arctic swimming.
[00:53:01.185 --> 00:53:02.546]  No, it's all lies.
[00:53:03.226 --> 00:53:06.109]  And it's no longer global warming, it's now climate change.
[00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:14.396]  Any season, any climate change, the bureaucrats got to take your house and your factory and your farm, because they care about you.
[00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:18.439]  And if they're doing it for a UN treaty, you really won't have any defense.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.442]  Forget about any of your constitutional protections.
[00:53:22.082 --> 00:53:26.666]  Once they think they've got themselves covered with one of these UN treaties, that's it, baby.
[00:53:27.673 --> 00:53:31.516]  And they've been using these things for a long time.
[00:53:31.896 --> 00:53:35.699]  It's simply a matter of moving the chess pieces a little further down the board.
[00:53:35.719 --> 00:53:38.881]  It's not as if they're inventing something brand new.
[00:53:41.563 --> 00:53:46.426]  How do we stop the UN pushing through a treaty just being watchful?
[00:53:49.308 --> 00:53:55.212]  We've got to be watchful, and that's one reason I hope people will go to gunowners.org, get themselves on our email list,
[00:53:55.794 --> 00:54:02.036]  Alertless, because we may have to respond very, very quickly when they try to pull one of these things.
[00:54:02.116 --> 00:54:07.178]  It may come up in any number of backhanded ways from behind closed doors.
[00:54:07.658 --> 00:54:09.458]  And so, we've got to be ever alert.
[00:54:09.778 --> 00:54:15.680]  Folks have to be ready, kind of like Minutemen, to get those emails, or this thing could just pass.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:16.441]  Absolutely.
[00:54:16.521 --> 00:54:17.961]  Larry, we're coming back to the full audience.
[00:54:17.981 --> 00:54:18.361]  Here we go.
[00:54:20.962 --> 00:54:23.883]  I'm going to let Larry Pratt go here in about a minute and a half, because the show's almost over.
[00:54:25.622 --> 00:54:44.227]  Before we do that, Larry, at the state level, at the county level, at the federal regulatory level, what are some of the biggest hot spots right now, some of the most dangerous threats to the Second Amendment, briefly, and then some of the good spots, some of the places where we're reclaiming our basic human right to self-defense?
[00:54:44.707 --> 00:54:54.069]  I would say one of the most important things that we have to do in the area of reclaiming is to get what we would call Katrina laws, laws that prohibit the
[00:54:54.693 --> 00:55:04.457]  The confiscation of guns from people during an emergency, unless they're committing a crime, but if they're just walking down the street with a shotgun... Yeah, you can't have emergency decrees to take people's guns.
[00:55:05.137 --> 00:55:13.140]  And if they do it, and just making it illegal won't stop them, because you hardly ever hear of police officers being prosecuted.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:23.964]  But if you do what was done at the federal level, thanks to Senator Vitter and then Representative Jindal, and if you do it at the state level, as they have done in Utah, you make it so that if
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:28.083]  Those guns are confiscated in spite of the law.
[00:55:28.523 --> 00:55:38.612]  The victim can bring a personal lawsuit, meaning that the police department or whatever does not pay for the guy's legal expenses.
[00:55:38.772 --> 00:55:45.998]  And if he loses and there's a monetary settlement against him, because these will be civil suits, he has to pay it out of his own pocket.
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:50.261]  There goes his home, there goes his savings, there goes his retirement.
[00:55:50.281 --> 00:56:00.604]  Yeah, we've got to punish people that violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution and that also gives police, you know, a law to say no to their superiors or to the governor or somebody else if they try that.
[00:56:00.864 --> 00:56:02.464]  Larry Pratt, thank you for joining us.
[00:56:03.045 --> 00:56:04.305]  Thank you for having me.
[00:56:04.585 --> 00:56:05.565]  I forgot one quick question.
[00:56:05.905 --> 00:56:07.826]  Is it encouraging to see record gun sales?
[00:56:09.144 --> 00:56:13.066]  Yes, I think it is, because I know it's bringing new people into the fold.
[00:56:13.166 --> 00:56:18.428]  I've had calls from people who say, well, I've never owned a gun, but, you know, ladies typically.
[00:56:18.948 --> 00:56:20.168]  But what kind of gun should I have?
[00:56:20.208 --> 00:56:22.009]  It's a good cultural revolution.
[00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:24.770]  I don't know a lot of liberals buying guns.
[00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:29.732]  They are waking up and realizing and understanding it's a very special, precious thing.
[00:56:29.812 --> 00:56:30.792]  Larry, thanks for joining us.
[00:56:31.193 --> 00:56:31.593]  Thank you.
[00:56:32.389 --> 00:56:32.729]  You bet.
[00:56:32.929 --> 00:56:36.211]  There goes Larry Pratt, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:37.131 --> 00:56:38.492]  We're about to end this transmission.
[00:56:38.532 --> 00:56:39.872]  We had a bunch of big guests on.
[00:56:39.892 --> 00:56:44.795]  Of course, Gary Franchi about the protest against the Federal Reserve all over the country, Alan Watt and others.
[00:56:46.209 --> 00:56:47.850]  That's coming up at the very end of the show.
[00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.132]  I'm getting over my cold, so the radio show is getting back on track.
[00:56:51.832 --> 00:57:01.478]  Before we end the broadcast, I do want to encourage everybody to listen to me very carefully and to start being self-sufficient, not just with firearms, but with storable foods.
[00:57:01.858 --> 00:57:12.084]  And the place to do that with the best storable foods available for the price, free stride, and dehydrated is efoodsdirect.com or J. Michael Stevens Group, 800-409-5633, with all the craziness and the upheaval.
[00:57:15.666 --> 00:57:16.567]  Going on in the world.
[00:57:16.627 --> 00:57:19.009]  It is more important than ever to be self-sufficient.
[00:57:19.029 --> 00:57:22.612]  It is more important than ever to not count on the government or anybody else.
[00:57:23.113 --> 00:57:29.238]  This is high quality food that lasts more than 10 years in climate controlled, 10 years in non-climate controlled, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633.
[00:57:29.278 --> 00:57:30.860]  This is insurance you can't afford to not have.
[00:57:37.005 --> 00:57:37.846]  800-409-5633.
[00:57:37.906 --> 00:57:40.527]  Call and get a free brochure.

[00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:57.311]  It's so cool.
[00:57:57.431 --> 00:57:59.612]  I hope you check out their whole line of products.
[00:57:59.632 --> 00:58:02.314]  They don't just have these neat atmospheric water generators there.
[00:58:02.334 --> 00:58:03.455]  They have a lot of other products.
[00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:05.456]  Solar panels, you name it.
[00:58:05.516 --> 00:58:06.316]  But just check them out.
[00:58:06.757 --> 00:58:08.278]  Ecolablue.com.
[00:58:08.438 --> 00:58:11.159]  E-C-O-L-O.com.
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:12.740]  They manufacture them.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.321]  They've got them.
[00:58:13.341 --> 00:58:14.261]  They've got them in stock.
[00:58:14.782 --> 00:58:16.903]  A lot of these atmospheric water generators are sold out, folks.
[00:58:16.923 --> 00:58:17.343]  They have them.
[00:58:17.724 --> 00:58:19.045]  Ecolablue.com.
[00:58:19.065 --> 00:58:20.205]  We have one right here in the office.
[00:58:20.525 --> 00:58:21.386]  I'm drinking it right here.
[00:58:21.406 --> 00:58:22.807]  In fact, put me on TV here real fast.
[00:58:25.413 --> 00:58:25.894]  Good stuff.
[00:58:28.256 --> 00:58:36.664]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, check out acolablue.com or 866-585-4044.
[00:58:37.305 --> 00:58:42.530]  That's 866-585-4044 or acolablue.com.

[00:58:43.611 --> 00:58:44.812]  Rebroadcast starts now.
