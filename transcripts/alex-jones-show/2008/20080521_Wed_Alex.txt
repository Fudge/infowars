[00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:11.439]  Okay, huge new development.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.527]  Burmess, being from New York, Jason Burmess of Blue's Change fame, down here working with us on a film that he's making called Fabled Enemies.
[00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:26.950]  That gets into some of the foreign governments that were involved.
[00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.372]  Very controversial.
[00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:32.576]  Burmess is here with us in studio.
[00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:38.323]  And he has listened to most of the hour-long interview with Jesse Ventura this morning.
[00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:41.567]  In fact, he would only give Stern 40 minutes, a 40-minute interview.
[00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:42.187]  Gave us 50.
[00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:43.268]  That was nice of the governor.
[00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:49.811]  Uh, and they start attacking him and he goes ahead and brings up insurance fraud with blowing up the buildings.
[00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:50.932]  This is huge.
[00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:51.772]  This is big.
[00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:54.974]  Uh, I wanted to bring it yesterday and I just didn't get around to it.
[00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:56.254]  Who does he think did it?
[00:00:56.554 --> 00:00:57.235]  Why did they do it?
[00:00:57.355 --> 00:01:01.036]  He talked about how he thinks somebody blew it up and how the government's done stuff before he implied it.
[00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:02.257]  But, uh...
[00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:05.239]  I didn't get to that, but here it is.
[00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:07.361]  The more he gets attacked, the more he's going to come out.
[00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.763]  And then this just gives others the courage to speak out.
[00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:13.446]  Burms, before we play this five minute clip, you've heard more than just the five minutes.
[00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:18.170]  Tell us exactly what you heard this morning.
[00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.211]  Sure.
[00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:23.754]  Basically, he goes over how the only way that our country would go down is from an internal enemy.
[00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:25.435]  And that whole thing.
[00:01:25.816 --> 00:01:26.756]  Yeah, it was great.
[00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:28.778]  Internal enemies carried out 9-11.
[00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:29.799]  Jesse Ventura.
[00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:30.879]  We need a headline with that.
[00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.542]  Another one on... says 9-11 was insurance fraud.
[00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:35.143]  Oh my God.
[00:01:35.363 --> 00:01:36.524]  Attack right now, man!
[00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:37.604]  Get the articles up.
[00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:38.005]  Go ahead.
[00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:54.611]  So then he, uh, they bring up, well, you're one of those guys that doesn't think that two planes could bring down three buildings, and he brings up building seven quick, but then he also brings up how the World Trade Center Twin Towers weren't making money anymore, and that it was going to cost a billion dollars to take the asbestos out, at least.
[00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:58.215]  And then he mentioned the $7 billion insurance scam.
[00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:03.121]  He didn't mention Silverstein by name, but he basically said... But why not just blow him up and let the city breathe it?
[00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:08.747]  That's how you use each New York child and cop and firefighter as a vacuum to get rid of it.
[00:02:08.788 --> 00:02:09.348]  That was cheaper.
[00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.089]  Demolition was not an option.
[00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:11.850]  That's the other thing.
[00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.051]  They were not going to be allowed to demolish the Twin Trade Center and control demolition.
[00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:18.551]  They had to go floor by floor to take out the asbestos.
[00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:21.492]  And lo and behold, 9-11 happens and it becomes a non-issue.
[00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.813]  So he mentioned, you know, this guy made $7 billion.
[00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:27.854]  All of a sudden, Howard's like, well, man, I guess I'm going to have to read your book.
[00:02:28.494 --> 00:02:30.795]  And he's like, yeah, you really do need to read my book.
[00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:32.276]  So he exposed the insurance scam.
[00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:34.156]  He talked about how he was a demolition expert.
[00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:37.698]  He used the analogy of propane and kerosene.
[00:02:37.898 --> 00:02:40.178]  It was just great because you can't attack Jesse Ventura.
[00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.119]  It's very hard to attack him.
[00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:43.180]  They were very friendly to him.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.980]  I was pretty surprised.
[00:02:45.396 --> 00:02:53.044]  Well, the little clip I heard was Robin trying to deny, going, well those buildings had problems, and well they collapsed because of an Easter Bunny.
[00:02:53.704 --> 00:02:54.805]  Let's be clear here.
[00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:59.470]  NIST has given five reasons it fell, and then they have retracted.
[00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.375]  Not the fuel tank, not bad construction, not melting steel, not weakening steel.
[00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:06.336]  They have now had to come in
[00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:10.360]  Not the tower falling, not the North Tower falling into it.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.222]  Turns out it only had some windows knocked out.
[00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:14.163]  Potman Mechanic shows a fake photo.
[00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:14.984]  It's even gray.
[00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:17.947]  The building side, it's not the red building side, brick red.
[00:03:18.287 --> 00:03:19.628]  They show the World Financial Center.
[00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:21.129]  They won't even show the right building.
[00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.251]  I mean, that's the type of scams they engage in.
[00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:26.634]  You know, they say NORAD never intercepted anybody in the year before 9-11.
[00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:27.975]  Total lie.
[00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:31.678]  We have Reuters with the head of it saying 160-something times the year before.
[00:03:31.698 --> 00:03:34.201]  I mean, it's just the deception
[00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:35.462]  of our enemies.
[00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:40.826]  It's like they're now saying we're lying and there weren't Pentagon videos and others confiscated by the FBI.
[00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:44.309]  When it's all admitted they won't release those tapes, but it doesn't matter.
[00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.270]  The public's weak-minded.
[00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.411]  They just show video and say we're lying.
[00:03:47.932 --> 00:03:52.575]  I mean, this is the level of dis- or they bring out black propaganda and that's where you
[00:03:53.456 --> 00:04:11.408]  Going back to JFK, folks, he would have cops and FBI and coroners who were going to testify, and they'd be totally normal, 30-40 year careers, totally normal, 25 year careers, and they'd get up on stand and say, I am a space alien, or they'd get up on stand and say, I fingerprint my daughter every day to make sure they haven't, you know, taken her.
[00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:13.629]  I'm a fingerprinting expert, and then go...
[00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.132]  You know, I mean, that's what they do, and so Stern is having black propaganda on.
[00:04:19.152 --> 00:04:21.934]  I mean, if I wanted to have them over a barrel, I could.
[00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:25.676]  My God, the slander is just the worst stuff they can say is being said.
[00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:29.238]  Then they have Ventura on, and I haven't had a chance to hear it all yet.
[00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:34.061]  Let's go ahead and play a few minutes of this to analyze enemy propaganda.
[00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:34.401]  Here it is.
[00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.672]  Hey, you're one of those guys who believes, you know, that 9-11, that you don't believe two planes knocked down three buildings, right?
[00:04:42.052 --> 00:05:01.697]  Well, I believed it when it happened, and then after I got out of office, my son kept badgering me to pay attention to these things on the internet, and I finally did, and I started studying it, and I started opening my eyes a little, and there's a lot of very difficult questions that have not been answered, and no one seems to want to provide an answer.
[00:05:01.717 --> 00:05:03.518]  What's the most difficult question that you see?
[00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:09.664]  I hate to fear what could have happened, that possibly we did it to ourselves.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.101]  You're kidding me!
[00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:36.089]  Well, Howard, I worked in demolition and was trained by the best guys in the United States Navy, being a frogman, and how could those buildings fall at the rate of gravity?
[00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:38.210]  Well, let me ask you something.
[00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:47.337]  I don't know much about this, but when jets go right into a building, couldn't there be so much trauma to the area that things can fall?
[00:05:47.517 --> 00:05:52.341]  No, because if you study how they built the buildings, those buildings were made to withstand
[00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:55.444]  But it seems unthinkable to me that our own government, I mean, this would be...
[00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.001]  You're talking about power.
[00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:19.163]  You're talking about foreign policy changing over this event.
[00:06:19.203 --> 00:06:22.506]  You're talking about getting control of the Middle Eastern oil.
[00:06:22.586 --> 00:06:26.048]  Do you think Bush is smart enough to pull off something like that?
[00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:27.829]  Hit pause for a minute.
[00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:28.350]  Hit pause.
[00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.850]  Back it up.
[00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:31.672]  Again, we all have blind spots.
[00:06:32.432 --> 00:06:33.913]  And I have had Ventura on.
[00:06:33.953 --> 00:06:36.415]  He broke that he's on I Love and Truth are on this show a month and a half ago.
[00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:38.857]  And then they said they wanted to come back on.
[00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:41.619]  They knew it had a great response and he likes the films and what we do.
[00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:45.026]  And so I get him back on and he says, oh man, they're really attacking me.
[00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:48.129]  And then the one question, because I was thinking the night before, what do I ask?
[00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:49.110]  And I wrote some notes here.
[00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.952]  The one question was, well, who did it?
[00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:51.693]  Why'd they do it?
[00:06:51.713 --> 00:06:52.914]  You know, what's the motive?
[00:06:53.034 --> 00:06:57.038]  And of course I talked about that with him two years ago in an interview where he said they might have done it.
[00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:58.979]  When he first started to talk.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.700]  That was even before he'd seen Loose Change.
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.600]  I pushed him over the edge.
[00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:03.441]  And I gave him some of my films.
[00:07:04.021 --> 00:07:07.622]  But I was literally waking up last night mad that I hadn't asked that question.
[00:07:07.882 --> 00:07:10.803]  And then thank God he just says it on Stern so we now have it.
[00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:12.144]  And then he brought the insurance thing.
[00:07:12.184 --> 00:07:13.224]  This is going to go crazy.
[00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:18.609]  Our government may have done 9-11, that's the headline.
[00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:20.891]  Another headline, insurance fraud.
[00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:29.381]  We need multiple articles, attack pattern Delta, tying in the video we got him a few days ago and the audio we've got here with all of it.
[00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:35.308]  And then challenging, we need articles, new people are going to be seeing this, that go through it all.
[00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:44.715]  And show what Jesse's saying, and show Building 7, and show the designers and builders saying about how it could take two fully loaded jets, not one.
[00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:47.697]  Yeah, they said two of those big jumbo jets.
[00:07:48.097 --> 00:07:57.844]  So, we need to show all that, we need to show how NIST admits that bombs, they're now looking at bombs for two years, and they keep saying, we'll release it in a month, we'll release it in a month.
[00:07:58.044 --> 00:08:01.307]  They'll never release what brought it down, because they scientifically know.
[00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.208]  Now there have been scientific papers published,
[00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:05.090]  Yeah, it had to be bombs.
[00:08:21.192 --> 00:08:29.459]  We also know that the eyewitnesses that were inside the building, that were blown up on the 8th floor, said that there were multiple explosions inside the building.
[00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:33.783]  So what they're going to do is they're going to take that 8th floor and bring it down and never even mention those.
[00:08:33.803 --> 00:08:45.753]  And they're going to say something happened on the 9th or 10th floor that caused instability in the building, that probably caused those fuel tanks to go up, and I believe there was also a large power generator there too.
[00:08:45.793 --> 00:08:47.855]  I'm sure that's going to fit into play as well.
[00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:50.037]  But here we are, Alex, we're almost seven years later.
[00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:51.358]  Still no NIST report.
[00:08:51.558 --> 00:09:03.108]  And the guy that's heading this NIST report, I think it's Sander something or other, this scientist, he's the guy that went to Popular Mechanics and said 25% or 10 stories of the building was actually scooped out.
[00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:04.910]  You can quote that from the article.
[00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.672]  It's just totally made up.
[00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:07.652]  It's just...
[00:09:08.493 --> 00:09:10.353]  That's like saying Godzilla ate the building.
[00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:11.194]  It just didn't happen.
[00:09:11.374 --> 00:09:12.854]  Absolutely, and we have the video to prove it.
[00:09:12.874 --> 00:09:17.295]  We literally have the video after at least one of the buildings has collapsed, of the south face of the building.
[00:09:17.415 --> 00:09:19.675]  Some of the glass has blown out, but some of the doors are still there.
[00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:24.116]  Then they go inside and they literally go through the lobby up into the second floor.
[00:09:24.136 --> 00:09:28.157]  In fact, that footage is in Truth Rising, and I think you're going to show some of that in your film.
[00:09:28.177 --> 00:09:28.297]  Yep.
[00:09:28.637 --> 00:09:33.818]  And there they are, the facade of the building with a few windows broken out, and they show a gray-sided building.
[00:09:34.098 --> 00:09:35.478]  The building was brick red.
[00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:37.899]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:09:39.025 --> 00:09:40.646]  They show the World Financial Center.
[00:09:40.706 --> 00:09:42.206]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[00:09:42.406 --> 00:09:51.990]  Yeah, and when we asked them, when we did our debate with Popular Mechanics, where they got that photograph from, or why they were able to see photographs that still weren't public, and we hadn't seen them.
[00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.831]  Oh yeah, they've been saying that.
[00:09:52.871 --> 00:09:54.111]  We've been shown secret photos.
[00:09:54.131 --> 00:09:56.432]  Yeah, we've been shown photos that no one else is allowed to see.
[00:09:56.572 --> 00:09:56.973]  Why?
[00:09:57.453 --> 00:09:58.253]  What's the big deal?
[00:09:58.293 --> 00:09:59.434]  Why isn't all this stuff public?
[00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.815]  If they have pictures that we don't have, why not show them to the public?
[00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.276]  Well, look, I had firefighters, months after it happened, send me disks with hundreds of high-res.
[00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:07.117]  Some of those are in the film.
[00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:09.081]  We even put some on the web a few years ago.
[00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:12.989]  These are giant government cameras, even back then they were huge pixels.
[00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:19.048]  10, 20 megapixel, whatever, high quality for seven years ago.
[00:10:19.889 --> 00:10:22.951]  And you see it and it's got some windows out.
[00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:25.232]  It shows other buildings on fire.
[00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:27.834]  You know, some of the smaller ones that got crushed but didn't fall.
[00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:36.980]  And in World War II, the Russians coming into Berlin would attack old buildings with giant artillery and aircraft for days and they wouldn't collapse.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.301]  The facade was still up.
[00:10:38.882 --> 00:10:44.245]  I mean, you don't just like have a fuel oil tank go off and then everything symmetrically collapses perfectly.
[00:10:44.465 --> 00:10:45.306]  Let's go back to the tape.
[00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:48.797]  I think there are people capable of doing it.
[00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:50.937]  And I'm not saying that it didn't happen.
[00:10:51.037 --> 00:10:55.198]  All I'm saying is that... Take jet fuel, for example.
[00:10:55.278 --> 00:10:56.238]  It's kerosene.
[00:10:56.818 --> 00:10:58.978]  Kerosene doesn't burn very hot.
[00:10:59.418 --> 00:11:09.000]  They're telling us that a kerosene-based fuel melted these steel concrete girders in a giant building so it would simply collapse to the ground.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.481]  And it collapsed in all powder.
[00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:14.261]  Wouldn't it come down in big chunks?
[00:11:15.197 --> 00:11:20.019]  The thing is, is the fire caused the columns to weaken and the sagging floors is what caused the building to implode.
[00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:36.986]  Well, if that's the case, okay, if that's the case, if you use that analogy, then when you go camping and use a propane stove, which propane burns hotter than kerosene does, if you leave it on for two hours and you put a big can of beans on your grill, shouldn't the grill collapse?
[00:11:38.038 --> 00:11:38.778]  See that Fred?
[00:11:40.479 --> 00:11:44.601]  It's not that much weight and it's not that much heat.
[00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:46.582]  Stay there ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:47.122]  Stay there.
[00:11:47.162 --> 00:11:50.244]  Now a propane stove is hotter than jet fuel.
[00:11:50.644 --> 00:11:53.445]  We'll be right back to conclude with this huge news.
[00:11:53.805 --> 00:11:55.566]  The insurance fraud clip is coming up.
[00:11:55.946 --> 00:11:56.727]  Stay with us.
[00:11:56.927 --> 00:11:58.508]  It is blowing wide open.
[00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:03.457]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[00:12:03.477 --> 00:12:06.340]  You leave it on for two hours, and you put a big, a bad much heat.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:06.860]  It doesn't matter.
[00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:09.323]  Stay there, ladies and gentlemen, stay there.
[00:12:11.986 --> 00:12:16.131]  Burma, I wanted to continue while we're, while the radio station, the network's on break.
[00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:19.415]  Have a discussion of just other thoughts you've got about this.
[00:12:20.523 --> 00:12:21.344]  You're also a fan of Hooters.
[00:12:21.384 --> 00:12:22.224]  To me it's like living hell.
[00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:45.360]  But the thing is, again, this is going to reach some of those everymen.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:54.749]  Maybe this reaches, you know, a hundred more cops, a hundred more firemen, you know, a hundred more guys that were down there as first responders that saw that molten metal that day are now ready to come public.
[00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:56.610]  You know, this is going to expand the audience.
[00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.392]  It's not going to be a hundred more.
[00:12:58.472 --> 00:13:00.554]  I mean, this guy's got tens of millions.
[00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:06.800]  Well, absolutely, but I'm saying, you know, people that were actually there at Ground Zero that do have first-hand eyewitness account information that's valuable.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.981]  That's the big one.
[00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:11.944]  Ventura's courage and the fact that it is coming out on places like Stern.
[00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:13.585]  This is going to go wide open.
[00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:18.448]  I need Nemo, I need Paul, I need Steve, I need everybody to do stories on every angle of this.
[00:13:18.468 --> 00:13:21.310]  And I need the listeners to go completely insane and get it out to everybody.
[00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:25.613]  Yeah, and this is the first time it's really been on Stern where someone's given a venue to speak.
[00:13:26.074 --> 00:13:31.618]  And he's not constantly attacked or his mic is cut or they're playing the cuckoo clock every time he says something.
[00:13:31.638 --> 00:13:33.019]  Notice there was no cuckoo clock today.
[00:13:33.419 --> 00:13:50.818]  Well, I mean, I don't appreciate Howard Stern's operation, I don't want to give any names out, letting people on saying the worst things you can say about me, and I'm very lenient and I've got thick skin, but there's some things, I'm just so busy I don't have time to write them a letter or call these bastards up and say, listen,
[00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:57.164]  You know, it's one thing you want to say I'm a liar, I'm a kook, I'm bad, but don't you dare say the things that are being said on there about me.
[00:13:57.945 --> 00:14:01.248]  That's a total lie, and that's life-wrecking type stuff that's being said.
[00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.873]  But the scum that does this, not just Stern letting it happen, but the scum that's saying it.
[00:14:07.253 --> 00:14:09.415]  I mean, they never listen until I end up dragging them through court.
[00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:10.977]  And then it's not a joke anymore.
[00:14:11.397 --> 00:14:12.137]  No, it's not, is it?
[00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:24.024]  And sometimes you just have to go through that legal process to prove to people that you're not playing around, that this is a serious issue, that you can't slander me in every which way, shape, and form to try to discredit the actual information that's out there.
[00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:27.165]  Well, one guy called up and said he was calling CPS on me and my kids.
[00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:29.907]  And I said, you filed that false report, I swear.
[00:14:29.927 --> 00:14:31.367]  I said, think about yourself.
[00:14:31.407 --> 00:14:33.408]  Don't make me spend 20, 30 grand ruining you.
[00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:36.010]  But I said, I mean, I'm just going to have to
[00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.332]  I guess make more examples out of people.
[00:14:38.653 --> 00:14:39.774]  Absolutely.
[00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:41.035]  I've already done it a bunch.
[00:14:41.055 --> 00:14:42.257]  People think I'm playing games here.
[00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:44.279]  I do what I say I'm going to do.
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.501]  You're just the target, Alex.
[00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:47.303]  You are the most outspoken person in this movement.
[00:14:47.323 --> 00:14:48.925]  Well, you keep my family out of it.
[00:14:49.105 --> 00:14:50.767]  That's why I leave the Bush's kids alone.
[00:14:51.128 --> 00:14:52.349]  You keep my family out of it.
[00:14:53.257 --> 00:14:54.118]  And just go ahead.
[00:14:54.158 --> 00:14:58.620]  Nah man, this is all about the information and it's always about attacking the messenger and not the message.
[00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:13.350]  And they don't want to attack the message because when you have somebody who's as smart as Ventura, who can present the information in a concise manner, who isn't Looney Tunes going, no planes hit the buildings, mashed potato planes and all this other nonsense, that's obviously there to discredit us.
[00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.511]  You have to address the information.
[00:15:15.832 --> 00:15:16.852]  And I think that's what they're gonna do.
[00:15:16.912 --> 00:15:24.199]  I hope that, you know, the guys over at Stern actually read his book and maybe that leads them to Loose Change or Terror Storm or Road to Tyranny.
[00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:32.066]  Actually, Gary, the producer, said that his son did watch Loose Change and Gary still won't watch it because it's a quote-unquote fake movie.
[00:15:33.362 --> 00:15:35.344]  So, you know, again, we're trying to bring more and more people in.
[00:15:35.424 --> 00:15:37.025]  You know, let's shock them with the truth.
[00:15:37.305 --> 00:15:37.605]  I agree.
[00:15:37.625 --> 00:15:40.968]  Let's go back and play the key part of the clip with Howard Stern on the main show.
[00:15:41.848 --> 00:15:43.149]  And again, I'm not looking for trouble.
[00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:50.795]  It's just, somebody send this clip to Stern and let him know, man, you better listen to what your boys are saying about me, because you're on very thin ice.
[00:16:20.763 --> 00:16:29.450]  Okay, let's go back to this clip of Howard Stern and Jesse Ventura as we analyze the way they try to counter him.
[00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:30.311]  Here it is.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.301]  See that, Fred?
[00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:37.822]  It's not that much weight and it's not that much heat.
[00:16:39.223 --> 00:16:45.505]  I don't eat beans.
[00:16:45.965 --> 00:16:48.246]  Gee, I mean... See, that's crazy.
[00:16:48.286 --> 00:16:49.106]  That's crazy.
[00:16:49.126 --> 00:16:56.749]  Like, even when you say that the planes were made to go through a certain way, you've never seen anything that was built to work a certain way, but you never know until something happens.
[00:16:56.769 --> 00:17:00.210]  Well, there is also in the report that they did not build
[00:17:03.711 --> 00:17:05.332]  They didn't build the buildings to code.
[00:17:05.372 --> 00:17:09.673]  They scrimped and they didn't do everything they were supposed to do.
[00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:11.574]  Hit pause, back it up ten seconds.
[00:17:12.174 --> 00:17:14.615]  Again, NISTA said they looked at it.
[00:17:14.655 --> 00:17:16.035]  They were built to code.
[00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.316]  They were underwritten by underwriting laboratories.
[00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.257]  They internally did their own test and found it had to be bombs.
[00:17:21.297 --> 00:17:23.858]  When Kevin Ryan released that, he got fired.
[00:17:24.198 --> 00:17:26.779]  So just more bull from these people.
[00:17:27.159 --> 00:17:29.580]  And we were playing this as a public service to show you the deception.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:31.621]  Of these individuals.
[00:17:32.682 --> 00:17:33.782]  Barmus, you got comments to that?
[00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:37.645]  Yeah, I mean, Underwriters Laboratory certified the steel structure.
[00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:44.129]  In other words, they had floor models there, after the fact also, that did not collapse, Alex.
[00:17:44.429 --> 00:17:50.933]  They subjected them to higher temperatures for longer periods of time, and the best they could do was have them sag.
[00:17:51.353 --> 00:17:52.354]  It's an utter lie.
[00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:55.476]  We know that, you know, I've heard that before.
[00:17:55.516 --> 00:17:57.278]  The buildings weren't brought to code!
[00:17:57.518 --> 00:17:59.019]  It's a total fabrication!
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.785]  And the disturbing part is, I've heard that come out of some of the 9-11 truthers, or supposed 9-11 truthers' mouths.
[00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:12.130]  That this was mafia built, and the concrete was light, and it was lightweight steel in the core, or that there's no core at all.
[00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.351]  I'm sure you've heard that one, Alex.
[00:18:15.933 --> 00:18:20.457]  Oh, they engage in just every form of deception you can imagine.
[00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:21.438]  Let's finish up with a clip.
[00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:24.231]  Yeah, but they didn't build the buildings to code.
[00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:27.154]  They scrimped and they didn't do everything they were supposed to do.
[00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:28.496]  Well, let's look at the history of the buildings.
[00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:30.378]  These two buildings were white elephants.
[00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:41.072]  They were losing money, they had asbestos in there, and they were being required by law to do over a billion dollars worth of asbestos removal.
[00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:44.265]  Do you think somebody might have sabotaged it?
[00:18:44.545 --> 00:18:45.546]  Just for that?
[00:18:45.626 --> 00:18:47.128]  It was an insurance job?
[00:18:47.148 --> 00:18:47.408]  Wow.
[00:18:47.468 --> 00:18:49.491]  I might have to read your book.
[00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.154]  It's called Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[00:18:52.274 --> 00:18:52.935]  It's in stores now.
[00:19:00.503 --> 00:19:02.544]  By Jesse Ventura, Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:19:02.944 --> 00:19:08.286]  And you even believe, you're one of those guys, you don't even believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone again in the Kennedy assassination.
[00:19:08.306 --> 00:19:11.107]  No I do not, because I've studied it for over 20 years.
[00:19:11.147 --> 00:19:12.867]  Stop right there, back it up again.
[00:19:12.887 --> 00:19:13.988]  Okay.
[00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:19.630]  In every major poll, it is now over 90% of Americans believe the government killed Kennedy.
[00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:28.157]  They've now come out on the BBC and NBC showing the film footage at the Ambassador Hotel of three CIA section chiefs from Asia.
[00:19:28.778 --> 00:19:31.661]  The famous guys involved with Kennedy with JFK as well.
[00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:35.344]  It's admitted that the guy that shot RFK behind him
[00:19:37.346 --> 00:19:37.827]  We're good to go.
[00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.251]  I mean, Jason, when does it end?
[00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:02.451]  It doesn't end.
[00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:09.714]  I mean, you know, that interview is almost over and they ridicule him for believing that Oswald was not the lone assassin after he's off the air.
[00:20:10.094 --> 00:20:13.736]  But just go to the videotape of the Secret Service by Kennedy that day.
[00:20:14.056 --> 00:20:21.679]  As they're turning the corner at Dealey Plaza, one of the Secret Service agents at the back of his car actually gets called off and he's not happy about it, Alex.
[00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.580]  He starts yelling and saying, no, I'm not going to do it.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.161]  Somebody ought to get this video online and add that video over it.
[00:20:27.962 --> 00:20:30.963]  Our great listeners, we don't have the personnel, but you can take it and put it all together for folks.
[00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.364]  And it shows a couple of them actually going, what?
[00:20:33.464 --> 00:20:34.305]  What are you saying?
[00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:37.006]  And then they later said that all procedures were blocked.
[00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:40.169]  You got LBJ behind him in the radio calling in the assault.
[00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:42.671]  Get ready, we're going with sniper position one.
[00:20:42.691 --> 00:20:45.193]  Because they had kill zones all the way down to the airport.
[00:20:45.734 --> 00:20:50.358]  They were ready with hand grenade attacks, bazooka attacks.
[00:20:50.739 --> 00:20:53.882]  If they had to, they were going to have military kill him and go to full martial law.
[00:20:54.082 --> 00:20:57.785]  They had riot troops in the air from the army flying above Dallas and
[00:20:58.946 --> 00:21:09.378]  Hours before Oswald's name came out, when the police were first, minutes after Kennedy's kill, it's already published in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, that Lee Harvey Oswald did it.
[00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:13.303]  Open and shut, just like they announced building 7 blew up before it blew up.
[00:21:13.643 --> 00:21:14.023]  Absolutely.
[00:21:14.043 --> 00:21:17.587]  In fact, Jonathan Elinoff from We Are Change Colorado has that.
[00:21:17.927 --> 00:21:18.608]  He got it from eBay.
[00:21:18.648 --> 00:21:23.913]  He's got the cover paper where they're literally blaming Oswald for the assassination before it happens.
[00:21:24.173 --> 00:21:25.935]  I mean, think for yourselves, people.
[00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:30.219]  If they can print this before an event, it's obviously not that guy.
[00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:30.499]  He's a patsy.
[00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:31.801]  They've got their time zones off.
[00:21:31.821 --> 00:21:32.021]  Yeah.
[00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:32.942]  I mean, they're going to make mistakes.
[00:21:32.962 --> 00:21:33.923]  The government's not perfect.
[00:21:34.183 --> 00:21:34.924]  They're not invincible.
[00:21:35.164 --> 00:21:36.125]  Byron Miss, thanks for coming in.
[00:21:36.205 --> 00:21:36.625]  Thank you.
[00:21:37.286 --> 00:21:38.167]  Well, let's talk during this break.
[00:21:39.983 --> 00:21:40.884]  We're on the march.
[00:21:41.604 --> 00:21:43.365]  All right, go ahead and get my next guest on.
[00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:43.745]  Thank you, John.
[00:21:43.765 --> 00:21:44.886]  I'm going to keep talking with Burmess.
[00:21:46.047 --> 00:21:49.169]  Burmess, I mean, any other comments you want to make about Ventura?
[00:21:49.849 --> 00:21:53.371]  You know, just that he's a brave guy, he's going to bring more and more people into 9-11 Truth.
[00:21:53.451 --> 00:22:03.037]  I was very, very happy with his conversation with the Minnesotans where he likened the press to pedophiles, you know, with the same disdain as for pedophiles because they're just there to attack.
[00:22:03.077 --> 00:22:05.159]  Well, he said that because they were going after his kids.
[00:22:05.179 --> 00:22:05.599]  That's right.
[00:22:05.919 --> 00:22:06.780]  That's right, that's right.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.822]  And he refuses to talk to the Minnesota Press, and God bless him for that.
[00:22:10.082 --> 00:22:18.349]  But he also brought up the Gulf of Tonkin, and how he was very surprised when he was over at Harvard, and McNamara came out in a speech and said, yeah, the whole thing was staged.
[00:22:18.709 --> 00:22:20.050]  He said he really took that to heart.
[00:22:20.811 --> 00:22:28.636]  And when some people in the audience who are obviously just not that educated on false flag terrorism or the Vietnam War in general heard that, they couldn't believe it.
[00:22:28.656 --> 00:22:30.057]  And he's like, yes, that's true.
[00:22:30.237 --> 00:22:31.878]  The Gulf of Tonkin never happened.
[00:22:31.979 --> 00:22:33.139]  It's well documented.
[00:22:33.419 --> 00:22:36.301]  Maybe it's time that you start rethinking 9-11 now.
[00:22:36.662 --> 00:22:38.203]  And the woman's like, yeah, maybe it is time.
[00:22:40.327 --> 00:22:43.930]  Well, I mean, the neocons have basically admitted what they've done.
[00:22:44.851 --> 00:22:49.174]  They have, I mean, they write letters to Akhmedinejad saying we'll stage more terror.
[00:22:49.895 --> 00:22:52.657]  The neocons write articles and memos saying, boy, it was sure great for us.
[00:22:52.917 --> 00:22:57.581]  Now, they did just, after eight years, take the PNAC website down last week.
[00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:59.902]  We've cached it, 9-11 bloggers cached it.
[00:23:00.263 --> 00:23:02.484]  We need to do a story on that, but I've only got three or four writers.
[00:23:02.524 --> 00:23:03.325]  Maybe a lister could do it.
[00:23:03.345 --> 00:23:06.828]  I wonder why they've now pulled where they said they wanted staged events.
[00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:14.033]  Absolutely, and I think the big problem was that all of their policy papers were available in PDF format, as well as their members.
[00:23:14.073 --> 00:23:17.075]  In other words, they had a list of members that were very high-profile people.
[00:23:17.375 --> 00:23:25.701]  People started getting hip to the Rebuilding America's Defenses document, which clearly states they need to stage a new Pearl Harbor-type event to go into the Middle East.
[00:23:26.002 --> 00:23:34.087]  They literally talk about the transformation of the military to UAVs and small robots, but they really say, yo, we're taking over the Middle East.
[00:23:34.147 --> 00:23:35.028]  We need to protect U.S.
[00:23:35.188 --> 00:23:41.617]  They also say they're going to use race-specific bioweapons and kill certain races, and Dick Cheney wrote that, and so here's the problem.
[00:23:43.137 --> 00:23:49.198]  I've already been on national shows and had them say those documents don't exist, and I'll direct them to PNAC, then they go, ooh, and look stupid.
[00:23:49.698 --> 00:23:52.159]  Now, you watch, they're going to now say those aren't real.
[00:23:52.439 --> 00:23:52.879]  Guaranteed.
[00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:53.599]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:23:53.619 --> 00:23:54.439]  That'll be the new thing.
[00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:55.279]  Absolutely.
[00:23:55.419 --> 00:24:04.061]  Well, even the cached stuff that you can find that was on their website that we didn't cache, in other words, just the stuff that's left over from their site, only has partial documents.
[00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:07.561]  For instance, if you go to the... Oh, no, they've been slowly for the last couple years pulling it down.
[00:24:07.622 --> 00:24:08.242]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:08.262 --> 00:24:10.102]  Like, if you go to the... We need a site that archives that.
[00:24:10.683 --> 00:24:17.431]  I'm hoping there's somebody out there that archived the entire site because you know in those policy papers the next false flag has been laid out.
[00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:20.315]  These are think tanks that put out all these different types of scenarios.
[00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:22.337]  They're also proud of themselves how they murder us.
[00:24:22.457 --> 00:24:24.260]  It's a celebration of their power.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.362]  Well let's look at some of the people that signed that document.
[00:24:26.402 --> 00:24:26.683]  Let's see.
[00:24:27.303 --> 00:24:28.784]  Dan Quayle, George H.W.'
[00:24:28.744 --> 00:24:30.145]  's former vice president.
[00:24:30.526 --> 00:24:36.210]  Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush, Scooter Libby, William Crystal.
[00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:40.754]  All of these neocons have literally signed on to this thing.
[00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:41.374]  It's incredible.
[00:24:41.394 --> 00:24:43.456]  They're terrorists and they're going to continue their black ops.
[00:24:43.476 --> 00:24:45.417]  I mean, they write memos saying they torture children.
[00:24:45.457 --> 00:24:46.058]  It's pure evil.
[00:24:46.338 --> 00:24:47.198]  Burmas, thanks for coming in.
[00:24:47.238 --> 00:24:47.559]  Thank you.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.401]  Okay, folks, we're going back live on the main network.
[00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:51.582]  We've got our next guest.
[00:24:51.762 --> 00:24:52.282]  He's over there.
[00:24:52.382 --> 00:24:52.803]  Stand by.
[00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:18.969]  We are now into hour number three, but we've now got a fourth hour coming up because there's so much news and information to cover.
[00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:27.072]  We'll cover a lot of news with Arizona State Senator Karen Johnson coming up in the fourth hour today.
[00:25:27.612 --> 00:25:31.653]  Somebody I've wanted to get in studio for quite a while is a radio talk show host.
[00:25:32.453 --> 00:25:33.934]  He also does presentations.
[00:25:34.954 --> 00:25:38.275]  I guess I'll let him describe what he thinks he is and the work he does.
[00:25:38.295 --> 00:25:39.716]  There's a lot of
[00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:46.564]  These kind of tinkerers in law and the Constitutional Bill of Rights, and most of them are very unsuccessful.
[00:25:46.984 --> 00:25:57.233]  I've seen them send many people I know, acquaintances to prison, magical straw man theories, UCC theories, imaginary quackery.
[00:25:59.655 --> 00:26:00.876]  So I don't traffic in that.
[00:26:00.936 --> 00:26:05.019]  Or people setting up trust and then they have you sign your property over to them and they take it.
[00:26:05.802 --> 00:26:14.654]  Some of the folks around ten years ago used to do that and so I wouldn't have anything to do with them and then they'd say I was a government agent because I wouldn't promote sending my listeners to somebody and get them sent to prison.
[00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:17.959]  You know, basic stuff like you saw with the poor Freeman.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.661]  You know, passing all these fake notes around.
[00:26:20.941 --> 00:26:22.341]  I'm not even saying they're bad people.
[00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:25.762]  They just are given a line of bull and they run with it.
[00:26:25.782 --> 00:26:29.363]  And that's why I have Larry Becraft on and other real lawyers and constitutional scholars.
[00:26:29.783 --> 00:26:32.163]  Because there are, George Gordon's another good one.
[00:26:32.183 --> 00:26:37.325]  He's won the Supreme Court and other state courts and state Supreme Courts and federal appellate courts.
[00:26:38.525 --> 00:26:42.228]  So I only have on people who I know won't send you directly to jail.
[00:26:42.668 --> 00:26:45.250]  Still, fighting the enemy will have them come after you in many cases.
[00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:50.934]  These are criminals who've had their way, that almost always win, who even think being criminal is good.
[00:26:52.014 --> 00:26:54.856]  And so, Randy Kelton, we'll also be talking during the breaks.
[00:26:54.896 --> 00:27:04.683]  If you're listening to InfoWars.com audio streams or watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, we're kind of overbooked today, and so I want to give him most of the full hour.
[00:27:05.003 --> 00:27:07.185]  So we're just going to talk straight through during the three-minute breaks.
[00:27:07.785 --> 00:27:12.171]  So folks, sorry to the MNFMs, this info is too important, but we appreciate you.
[00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:25.328]  Folks will hear that after the break, but for internet listeners and for folks watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, this is so important, it's a public service announcement, that we're going to go ahead and blow through the breaks, but you'll have to go to InfoWars.com to hear those on those streams.
[00:27:26.229 --> 00:27:29.691]  Also, even though you hear this, don't think you can just run out and do this immediately.
[00:27:30.071 --> 00:27:31.252]  Understand it's at your own peril.
[00:27:31.292 --> 00:27:33.293]  This is a lawless, criminal government.
[00:27:33.893 --> 00:27:35.374]  So there is no silver bullet here.
[00:27:36.315 --> 00:27:37.956]  But I want to thank Randy Kelton for coming in.
[00:27:38.016 --> 00:27:42.478]  Randy, take a minute or two to tell folks about yourself, a veteran, how you woke up with the New World Order.
[00:27:43.158 --> 00:27:51.923]  I like how you talk about some of the wrong things you did, how you woke up to that, because people can always turn back and become good people like you've done, and then stand up for righteousness.
[00:27:52.463 --> 00:27:53.084]  Thanks for coming in.
[00:27:54.497 --> 00:27:54.977]  You're welcome.
[00:27:55.918 --> 00:27:57.900]  I started this in 1981.
[00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:00.763]  I spent the night in jail for driving with a headlight out.
[00:28:02.165 --> 00:28:03.386]  That did not seem right.
[00:28:03.987 --> 00:28:08.852]  So when I got out of jail, I got out the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure and I read them.
[00:28:09.747 --> 00:28:14.791]  And then I looked at what they were actually doing, and I thought, I must have stepped to the looking glass.
[00:28:15.532 --> 00:28:19.816]  Or there's some major maxim of law that I have missed.
[00:28:20.436 --> 00:28:20.937]  But let's go back.
[00:28:20.977 --> 00:28:22.658]  Let's talk about you, Randy Kelton, the person.
[00:28:23.239 --> 00:28:23.879]  About your life.
[00:28:23.939 --> 00:28:24.640]  Regular guy?
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.662]  Well, I was just a regular guy.
[00:28:26.682 --> 00:28:27.682]  I had my own business.
[00:28:27.703 --> 00:28:29.444]  I'm a combat veteran.
[00:28:30.885 --> 00:28:32.647]  Talk a little bit about your experience there.
[00:28:34.497 --> 00:28:45.264]  Well, my main experience I had there was Uncle Sam gave me the honor and privilege of holding my twin brother's hand in Chulai, South Vietnam, while he died of gangrene.
[00:28:46.705 --> 00:28:59.954]  The last intelligible thing he said to me on this earth, before the gangrene, the pain, and morphine took his mind away, he was looking across the hall at a VC they were taking care of, and he said, you know, they're going to win this war.
[00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:02.291]  And I said, well, why would you say that?
[00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:03.831]  They're the good guys.
[00:29:04.252 --> 00:29:05.312]  We should never have been here.
[00:29:06.273 --> 00:29:08.874]  My brother died thinking he was the bad guy.
[00:29:09.694 --> 00:29:12.636]  And in my later studies, I found he was right.
[00:29:13.636 --> 00:29:15.337]  They were fighting for their independence.
[00:29:15.817 --> 00:29:16.778]  We were shooting at them.
[00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:17.678]  We shouldn't have been there.
[00:29:17.858 --> 00:29:19.079]  Tell you what, stay there, folks.
[00:29:19.099 --> 00:29:19.919]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[00:29:19.939 --> 00:29:23.021]  But Randy, let's continue this discussion during this break.
[00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:25.522]  For all the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, stay with us.
[00:29:33.075 --> 00:29:34.296]  Okay, Randy, continue.
[00:29:34.536 --> 00:29:38.039]  Normally I wouldn't have went there, but this is what motivated me.
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.741]  This is what kept me going.
[00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:41.522]  What did you do in the military in Vietnam?
[00:29:41.943 --> 00:29:44.765]  I loaded bombs and rockets on fighter-type aircraft.
[00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:48.008]  And how did your brother get gangrene?
[00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:52.852]  He was in the Army and was the last man off the LZ, stepped on a bouncing Betty.
[00:29:53.433 --> 00:29:55.635]  He said he knew what it was when he heard it function.
[00:29:55.655 --> 00:29:58.898]  A bouncing Betty shoots a projectile up about three feet.
[00:29:59.418 --> 00:30:00.920]  And then it explodes to blow your genitals off?
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.042]  So it's anti-personnel.
[00:30:03.402 --> 00:30:06.285]  Well, he dropped down on it to capture it and it just blew him all to pieces.
[00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:11.270]  When I got to Chula, I was in... He dropped down on it to capture it?
[00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.032]  You mean to protect his body?
[00:30:13.092 --> 00:30:13.292]  Yes.
[00:30:13.613 --> 00:30:14.454]  He was trained to do that?
[00:30:14.654 --> 00:30:14.854]  Right.
[00:30:14.974 --> 00:30:18.298]  One other person got hurt, but he was the only one that didn't survive.
[00:30:19.379 --> 00:30:22.162]  And he would have survived, except he had a negative blood type.
[00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:28.772]  When I got to Vietnam, the doctor met me in the doorway of the medevac hospital and asked me my blood type.
[00:30:28.852 --> 00:30:29.693]  I said A-positive.
[00:30:30.593 --> 00:30:32.495]  He said, you're Richard's twin?
[00:30:32.515 --> 00:30:33.035]  Yes, I am.
[00:30:33.676 --> 00:30:34.216]  That can't be.
[00:30:34.256 --> 00:30:35.157]  His is A-negative.
[00:30:35.457 --> 00:30:36.117]  Yes, it can.
[00:30:36.398 --> 00:30:37.298]  Darn near killed me.
[00:30:37.318 --> 00:30:42.282]  It's not supposed to be possible for twins to be opposite RH factor.
[00:30:43.162 --> 00:30:46.425]  He said he didn't think there were 10 pints of A-negative blood in country.
[00:30:46.485 --> 00:30:47.466]  He put out a call and got 100.
[00:30:47.506 --> 00:30:48.987]  The 63rd killed him.
[00:30:51.309 --> 00:31:03.919]  Something in it he responded to shut down his kidneys and from that point they knew he was gonna he would not survive and the gangrene took him and he went hard.
[00:31:06.742 --> 00:31:15.689]  So when these guys come after me what in the heck do they think they can throw at me that doesn't pale into insignificance?
[00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:19.284]  And they staged a terror attack to get us into that war.
[00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:20.205]  Yes, they did.
[00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:23.068]  And they've done it every time since.
[00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:28.775]  I'm trying to do the only thing I can to undermine these guys.
[00:31:30.677 --> 00:31:31.698]  I'm very focused.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.043]  I don't look into all kinds of different theories of law.
[00:31:37.719 --> 00:31:41.042]  It is my position that you and I are sovereign citizens.
[00:31:41.682 --> 00:31:48.507]  Not sovereign in the context of my sovereign rights and my sovereign privileges, but in my sovereign duty.
[00:31:49.688 --> 00:31:53.110]  These people are my employees and they are not to forget it.
[00:31:54.351 --> 00:31:56.472]  When I go into a court, I wear two hats.
[00:31:56.692 --> 00:31:58.132]  I go in with my litigants hat on.
[00:31:59.052 --> 00:32:07.074]  But when one of my public officials steps across one of my legal lines, that litigants hat comes off, and my sovereign hat goes on, and we're gonna fight.
[00:32:08.015 --> 00:32:09.995]  Okay, we're about to come back on the main show.
[00:32:10.155 --> 00:32:12.516]  Let's get into your early 1980s.
[00:32:12.876 --> 00:32:13.416]  What happens?
[00:32:13.436 --> 00:32:20.178]  You start reading how they're supposed to conduct their activities and what they really do, and you find out that it's just all lawless criminal activity.
[00:32:20.959 --> 00:32:27.395]  And just explain what you've gone through, what you've witnessed, the victories you've had, the defeats you've had, that Williamson County story.
[00:32:27.435 --> 00:32:27.736]  Here we go.
[00:32:36.787 --> 00:32:37.427]  Big Brother.
[00:32:38.087 --> 00:32:39.108]  Mainstream media.
[00:32:39.868 --> 00:32:40.968]  Government cover-ups.
[00:32:41.609 --> 00:32:42.429]  You want answers?
[00:32:43.189 --> 00:32:44.070]  Well, so does he.
[00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.371]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:53.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:04.576]  He's Randy Kelton, the rule of law.
[00:33:04.817 --> 00:33:05.957]  That's what he talks about.
[00:33:07.797 --> 00:33:10.178]  And we'll give you one of his websites.
[00:33:11.498 --> 00:33:13.658]  It's jurisprudence.com.
[00:33:13.799 --> 00:33:17.599]  Not jurisprudence, but jurisprudence.com.
[00:33:17.659 --> 00:33:19.540]  J-U-R-I-S-I-M.
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:20.920]  Prudence.com.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:24.161]  We'll tell you more about that as we have him with us in the hour.
[00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:26.402]  So, it's the early 1980s.
[00:33:26.462 --> 00:33:27.202]  Start back there.
[00:33:27.782 --> 00:33:42.486]  You get pulled over, then you get taken to jail for a headlight out, and you go back and look at the law, and look at what they're supposed to do, and look at the code, break that down, then we'll go through the sagas, and the things you've witnessed, and the people you've gotten fired, the people you've gotten in trouble, because you have had some successes.
[00:33:42.506 --> 00:33:43.427]  Yes, I have.
[00:33:44.007 --> 00:33:45.047]  And I've had some failures.
[00:33:46.347 --> 00:33:54.750]  The reason I brought that up is so many people go before the courts, and they get screwed around, and they think there must be some magic thing that I missed.
[00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:57.974]  There's something important I don't know.
[00:33:58.974 --> 00:33:59.814]  Well, there's not.
[00:34:00.454 --> 00:34:01.835]  These guys are just criminals.
[00:34:02.635 --> 00:34:06.196]  They're just doing whatever they want to do because they believe they can.
[00:34:07.397 --> 00:34:10.057]  I kicked this dog for some 25 years.
[00:34:11.678 --> 00:34:14.539]  Three dislocated ribs, two broken collarbones, and a broken elbow.
[00:34:15.993 --> 00:34:20.235]  I never brought this to anyone else because I hadn't found a way to do it safely.
[00:34:20.355 --> 00:34:21.875]  Well, let's go through all the things that happened.
[00:34:21.895 --> 00:34:24.576]  I mean, let's go back to the cop arrest you for no headlight.
[00:34:24.616 --> 00:34:25.256]  How did that happen?
[00:34:25.276 --> 00:34:27.117]  And then go through all the things you've been through.
[00:34:27.477 --> 00:34:37.821]  He was in a bad mood and he asked me for my proof of insurance and I said, well, if I show you my proof of insurance and you look at it and see that it expired yesterday, what will you do?
[00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:38.721]  He said, I'll arrest you.
[00:34:39.341 --> 00:34:40.642]  In that case, I'm not going to show it to you.
[00:34:42.073 --> 00:34:43.195]  Well, he arrested me anyway.
[00:34:44.276 --> 00:34:45.958]  But that was really a minor thing.
[00:34:46.018 --> 00:34:47.180]  It just opened the door.
[00:34:48.061 --> 00:34:51.326]  After that, I had a sheriff's deputy try to kill me once in front of my house.
[00:34:52.007 --> 00:34:52.768]  What happened with that?
[00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:54.710]  We went to court.
[00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:55.692]  I beat him in court.
[00:34:56.531 --> 00:34:59.653]  But the deputies made up a story that never happened.
[00:35:00.353 --> 00:35:01.694]  And there was a street full of witnesses.
[00:35:01.734 --> 00:35:03.155]  And that shocks you when they lie.
[00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:05.736]  I've had them do it to me, and it's like, you're a criminal!
[00:35:06.136 --> 00:35:07.777]  And they just smile and go, yeah, I am.
[00:35:08.037 --> 00:35:09.558]  We had a whole street full of witnesses.
[00:35:09.778 --> 00:35:13.000]  I'm thinking, how can they imagine they can get this past the courts?
[00:35:13.541 --> 00:35:14.001]  They could.
[00:35:14.561 --> 00:35:17.743]  The courts was not interested in anything anyone had to say.
[00:35:18.443 --> 00:35:21.365]  They were intent on prosecuting me no matter what.
[00:35:22.626 --> 00:35:24.707]  But the jury was not quite so intent.
[00:35:26.677 --> 00:35:36.267]  My daughter worked for a woman whose husband was on the jury and she said they were irate when they found out what was actually going on.
[00:35:37.409 --> 00:35:43.315]  So I beat them there, but I was in the process of trying to fix the system.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:45.637]  I felt like I owed this to my brother.
[00:35:46.738 --> 00:35:52.420]  That I should lay down and roll over for these scum after what he paid for.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.020]  So the fight was on.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:01.322]  And I didn't, I just appeared recently on the scene because I wouldn't ask someone to take the kind of risks I was taking.
[00:36:01.362 --> 00:36:05.303]  So you've been doing this for two decades plus and you've now developed some things you think work.
[00:36:05.683 --> 00:36:14.370]  Yes, when I came across actually filing criminal charges against them, and going after grand juries, everything changed.
[00:36:15.371 --> 00:36:17.172]  Folks, there is an answer out there.
[00:36:17.192 --> 00:36:19.734]  Well, we're going to talk about it, but let's go back to how you got bones broken.
[00:36:20.855 --> 00:36:23.417]  Well, I had a sheriff deputy grab me.
[00:36:24.257 --> 00:36:27.780]  He was just one of these policemen who shouldn't have been a policeman.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.741]  That's a power trip, yeah.
[00:36:28.821 --> 00:36:35.026]  Yeah, he had stopped my son in front of my house a day after I filed suit against the sheriff over at Open Records.
[00:36:36.047 --> 00:36:37.508]  It's just a technical suit.
[00:36:38.649 --> 00:36:44.172]  And the next day I looked out my front door and I saw this policeman out there throw something down, kick it up in the air.
[00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:46.574]  And I thought that looked odd.
[00:36:46.874 --> 00:36:47.654]  I stepped outside.
[00:36:47.674 --> 00:36:49.475]  He had my son pulled over in front of my house.
[00:36:50.296 --> 00:36:52.917]  And when I went to find out what was going on, he tried to kill me.
[00:36:54.518 --> 00:36:58.841]  And people claim that the sheriff sent him to do it, but I don't think so.
[00:36:58.861 --> 00:36:59.862]  The guy was just crazy.
[00:37:00.643 --> 00:37:08.068]  Well, I've seen cases where the guy's got a sign saying our judicial system's a joke outside the judge's jurisdiction, and he has cops go arrest him for saying that.
[00:37:08.869 --> 00:37:09.689]  I mean, they're crazy.
[00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.292]  What I do will help put an end to that.
[00:37:14.392 --> 00:37:15.533]  It really does work.
[00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:21.438]  When you start thinking and acting like a sovereign, I don't even mess with policemen anymore.
[00:37:21.498 --> 00:37:23.239]  Well, I want to talk about all that, and we're going to.
[00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:30.404]  We'll have you back again, Randy, but right now, I want people to get the backside of this, kind of the war stories, I mean, abbreviated, the saga.
[00:37:30.925 --> 00:37:35.468]  Some of the things you've seen, like a few months ago in Williamson County, you went to file a complaint, and what happened there?
[00:37:35.488 --> 00:37:42.374]  I mean, I don't think citizens, until it happens to them, then they're isolated, nobody cares, realize what it's like till they're there framing you.
[00:37:43.257 --> 00:37:55.821]  Yes, for me it was difficult and I absolutely knew that I'm going to kick you guys behinds every way from Sunday, but it was still difficult standing on that cold concrete floor for 29 hours.
[00:37:59.335 --> 00:38:00.556]  This happens to everybody.
[00:38:00.636 --> 00:38:01.657]  I've had a number of things.
[00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:02.537]  My elbow got broke.
[00:38:02.557 --> 00:38:18.947]  It was kind of my fault because I told a bailiff when I was trying to file criminal charges with the grand jury against the district attorney and he demanded to know what my purpose was in the building today and I had already asked him for the grand jury so he knew.
[00:38:20.068 --> 00:38:23.410]  So I told him, well I have business here today and it's none of yours.
[00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.458]  He said, well I'm the court security officer and the bailiff and court bailiff and I want to know what your business is.
[00:38:30.179 --> 00:38:34.687]  I said, well if you're the court bailiff then right there at the courtroom just scoot on in there and be a good little bailiff.
[00:38:35.027 --> 00:38:35.628]  You're dismissed.
[00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:38.590]  Well, he didn't take that well.
[00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:39.990]  You don't talk to a God like that.
[00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.771]  They talk to us, the slaves, like that.
[00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:42.931]  Not the other way around.
[00:38:43.471 --> 00:38:45.752]  They drug me down the stairs and pushed me out the door.
[00:38:46.792 --> 00:38:49.353]  But to his credit, he didn't intend to break my elbow.
[00:38:49.813 --> 00:38:50.573]  Oh, how nice of him.
[00:38:50.673 --> 00:38:51.914]  Okay.
[00:38:52.094 --> 00:39:00.236]  As I stepped out the door, my foot stepped down on a throw rug, a carpet there, and he was pushing me, so it gave me a little forward movement.
[00:39:00.576 --> 00:39:02.977]  It scooted that carpet out from under me, and I fell and broke my elbow.
[00:39:05.151 --> 00:39:07.215]  But I didn't charge him with that.
[00:39:08.717 --> 00:39:10.300]  I've been real careful in what I do.
[00:39:11.822 --> 00:39:16.650]  If they can get you into a fight with them, they will win every time.
[00:39:17.346 --> 00:39:20.807]  Well, that's why they'll come up and yell and scream at you while you're calm and say, why are you so upset?
[00:39:21.087 --> 00:39:27.150]  Yeah, and if they get too excited with me, I like to take out my cell phone and dial 9-1-1.
[00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.311]  I got this policeman here, I think he's going crazy.
[00:39:30.651 --> 00:39:34.873]  He's got slobber dripping out of his mouth, his eyes are bugging out, I think he's going to have a heart attack.
[00:39:35.233 --> 00:39:37.374]  You need to get somebody out here before he shoots me.
[00:39:38.714 --> 00:39:40.355]  This always slows him down.
[00:39:41.209 --> 00:39:43.111]  Because they wind up with another policeman out there.
[00:39:43.131 --> 00:39:44.391]  And you call that the chicken dance?
[00:39:44.612 --> 00:39:54.960]  Yeah, they start doing this little chicken dance where the one I call and I'm asking him to arrest his buddy and he's got my call on 9-1-1 and that's not going to go away.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:40:02.385]  He don't want to arrest his buddy and I keep insisting and with him I get real obnoxious.
[00:40:03.206 --> 00:40:08.870]  And he starts scooting back and forth from one foot to another and I call that their little chicken dance.
[00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:17.935]  When you become the sovereign and invoke the same law that they use against you, it changes everything.
[00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:22.939]  So, I've been doing this quite a while and it took some time.
[00:40:22.959 --> 00:40:26.301]  It took some learning of things you can do and things you can't do.
[00:40:26.881 --> 00:40:28.002]  Stay away from the sheriff.
[00:40:28.503 --> 00:40:29.904]  Stay away from the police department.
[00:40:30.624 --> 00:40:31.845]  All that'll do is get you beat up.
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.606]  Well, I was thrown out of the Sheriff's Department one day by the Chief Deputy when I was there to file criminal complaints.
[00:40:39.646 --> 00:40:47.494]  And I stood in front of the place and looked around and thought, I bet if I try to leave this county, somebody's going to be waiting for me.
[00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:52.459]  So I went to the county judge and asked him to call the Sheriff's Department and see if they had a warrant for me.
[00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:54.581]  Asked him to call the Chief Deputy.
[00:40:55.985 --> 00:40:59.388]  And the county judge wanted to know why I wanted him to do that.
[00:41:00.068 --> 00:41:04.451]  I said, well, I got a bad feeling he's going to be sitting out there on the highway waiting for me.
[00:41:04.932 --> 00:41:06.253]  Oh, he wouldn't do a thing like that.
[00:41:07.093 --> 00:41:08.975]  I don't know, but if he did, it'd be bad news.
[00:41:09.315 --> 00:41:11.877]  He called the Sheriff's Department and asked for Doug.
[00:41:12.777 --> 00:41:13.718]  Well, Doug's not here.
[00:41:13.778 --> 00:41:14.919]  He's out in his cruiser.
[00:41:16.417 --> 00:41:23.222]  The judge looked at me and kind of gave me a halfway smile and said, well, have Doug call me.
[00:41:23.242 --> 00:41:32.970]  Doug called him and he said, I have Randy Kelton in my office and he's concerned that someone may be out waiting on the highway for him to go home.
[00:41:33.939 --> 00:41:35.881]  Where are you, Mr. Whitehead?
[00:41:36.321 --> 00:41:38.483]  Oh, well, I'm just making some rounds in my cruiser.
[00:41:38.683 --> 00:41:40.985]  Since when does the Chief Deputy make rounds?
[00:41:41.225 --> 00:41:42.967]  Well, I had business to take care of.
[00:41:43.627 --> 00:41:46.990]  Well, Mr. Whitehead, I hope your business is back at the Sheriff's Department.
[00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.752]  Now, now, that's not even paranoia.
[00:41:48.792 --> 00:41:50.493]  Tell folks what just happened to you in Williamson County.
[00:41:50.974 --> 00:41:52.195]  Why you were there, what happened?
[00:41:52.575 --> 00:41:59.621]  Well, I went to Williamson County because everyone told me that Williamson County is the most corrupt in the nation.
[00:42:00.602 --> 00:42:01.363]  Or in the state.
[00:42:01.743 --> 00:42:06.326]  I do seminars all over the country, and everybody says, my county's the most corrupt in the state.
[00:42:06.726 --> 00:42:07.467]  Except here.
[00:42:08.288 --> 00:42:11.770]  Here, everybody says, Williamson County's the most corrupt.
[00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:17.354]  And something I know about, the more corrupt they are, the more vulnerable they are.
[00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:22.227]  Most policemen don't get into the police work to be jackbooted thugs.
[00:42:22.928 --> 00:42:24.830]  But they get stuck in this corrupt system.
[00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:26.352]  They know it's corrupt.
[00:42:26.793 --> 00:42:27.414]  They don't like it.
[00:42:27.434 --> 00:42:30.077]  But if they're going to keep their job, they're going to follow along.
[00:42:30.657 --> 00:42:33.681]  And then somebody comes along and points their finger right at it.
[00:42:34.642 --> 00:42:36.623]  Well, they knew they were corrupt all the time.
[00:42:36.663 --> 00:42:39.185]  The more corrupt they are, the more concerned they are.
[00:42:39.865 --> 00:42:46.829]  And the first thing they're going to do is creak open their little closet door and look at their darkest skeleton and figure out how I'm going to find it.
[00:42:47.709 --> 00:42:49.310]  So that's why I went to Williamson County.
[00:42:49.851 --> 00:42:53.653]  I filed a criminal charge with the district attorney against the sheriff's deputy.
[00:42:55.131 --> 00:42:58.293]  And that was with what had happened.
[00:42:58.313 --> 00:43:05.038]  A deputy had arrested a woman in Travis County sitting in a parking lot with her lights on.
[00:43:05.499 --> 00:43:06.399]  He saw a headlight out.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.361]  He pulled into Travis County.
[00:43:11.143 --> 00:43:12.224]  It was in front of a beer joint.
[00:43:12.324 --> 00:43:14.885]  He did a sobriety test on her.
[00:43:15.931 --> 00:43:25.796]  ran her license and found that ten years earlier she had three DUIs and it had been ten years, you know, when she was in her late teens and pretty wild, she got over that.
[00:43:26.757 --> 00:43:28.718]  So he arrested her and took her back to Williamson County.
[00:43:29.678 --> 00:43:32.860]  It had been almost a year, her trying to get it to trial.
[00:43:34.801 --> 00:43:37.603]  So they told me about it and uh...
[00:43:38.755 --> 00:43:43.076]  First thing I did was file criminal charges against the officer for false arrest.
[00:43:43.796 --> 00:43:45.176]  You're not supposed to be out of your jurisdiction.
[00:43:46.136 --> 00:43:52.438]  Technically, he can go four hundred yards out of his jurisdiction, but not for a misdemeanor, only for a felony.
[00:43:53.278 --> 00:43:57.079]  And he claimed that he followed her from Williamson County into Travis County.
[00:43:58.319 --> 00:43:59.739]  So, he lied.
[00:44:00.339 --> 00:44:01.719]  We had conflicting opinions.
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.260]  I wanted a grand jury to sort it out.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:03.800]  Actually,
[00:44:04.773 --> 00:44:09.536]  I wanted the district attorney to refuse to take the complaint so I could try to get him arrested.
[00:44:10.957 --> 00:44:13.179]  I always want to go for the highest guy in the district.
[00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:15.100]  Don't want to mess with the policeman.
[00:44:16.561 --> 00:44:18.243]  Article 2.03 Texas Code of Conduct.
[00:44:18.343 --> 00:44:18.743]  Stay there.
[00:44:18.763 --> 00:44:25.448]  We're going to get into how to do this when we get back and we'll talk about some other issues behind the scenes at InfoWars.com if you're listening there.
[00:44:25.948 --> 00:44:26.688]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:44:26.708 --> 00:44:27.129]  Stay with me.
[00:44:31.636 --> 00:44:34.420]  Randy, I want to get back to that story with Williamson County and then get into the solutions.
[00:44:35.041 --> 00:44:43.713]  But right now, because I want to keep the show congruent for those that are listening on the main radio line, but other side issues or anything else you want to cover?
[00:44:45.225 --> 00:44:45.465]  No.
[00:44:46.406 --> 00:44:51.148]  Too much information in just this one section with only an hour.
[00:44:51.168 --> 00:44:51.929]  I don't have enough time.
[00:44:51.949 --> 00:44:52.949]  Okay, well let's go back then.
[00:44:53.009 --> 00:44:54.590]  Let's go back because I don't want to break it up.
[00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.551]  Tell us some more horror stories of corruption.
[00:44:58.312 --> 00:45:04.035]  Well, the Ridhabeus Corpus I have before the grand jury right now.
[00:45:05.076 --> 00:45:09.178]  A kid in Montgomery County gets stopped for DUI.
[00:45:09.198 --> 00:45:12.860]  The Republic of Texas guys call me to see if I can do something about it.
[00:45:13.925 --> 00:45:16.786]  I go down there and no court record.
[00:45:18.026 --> 00:45:19.147]  There's no record he exists.
[00:45:19.187 --> 00:45:20.987]  He's been sitting in jail for three, four weeks.
[00:45:21.828 --> 00:45:23.528]  And the court clerk doesn't know he exists.
[00:45:23.808 --> 00:45:24.829]  They do that all the time now.
[00:45:25.029 --> 00:45:25.749]  Yes, they do.
[00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:28.810]  And I charge them with felony tampering with a government document for doing it.
[00:45:29.758 --> 00:45:36.262]  Because when the magistrate does that little hearing that he does, they call it a magistration.
[00:45:37.022 --> 00:45:37.763]  They made that up.
[00:45:38.443 --> 00:45:39.624]  Magistration doesn't exist.
[00:45:39.864 --> 00:45:42.226]  If you type it into Microsoft Word, it puts a little red line under it.
[00:45:42.246 --> 00:45:43.006]  It doesn't recognize it.
[00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:47.269]  There is such a thing they're supposed to do, and it's called an examining trial.
[00:45:47.289 --> 00:45:51.911]  And there's a whole chapter in the Code of Criminal Procedure that defines what's done in an examining trial.
[00:45:51.931 --> 00:45:52.772]  They do none of that.
[00:45:54.465 --> 00:46:09.739]  There's another statute under chapter 17 under bail that tells the magistrate after an examination he's to seal all documents had in the hearing, cause his name to be written across the seal, forward it to the clerk of the court of jurisdiction.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.220]  They don't do that.
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:15.424]  They give it to the prosecutor to keep the speedy trial clock from starting.
[00:46:16.085 --> 00:46:18.187]  That gives him time to squeeze a deal out of you.
[00:46:20.265 --> 00:46:21.006]  That's a felony.
[00:46:21.927 --> 00:46:23.849]  Yeah, that's a form of cruel and unusual torture.
[00:46:23.969 --> 00:46:30.196]  I mean, that's punishment to throw someone in and then have no record of them in some gulag.
[00:46:30.456 --> 00:46:34.060]  That's the opposite of due process, the opposite of habeas corpus, the Magna Carta.
[00:46:34.481 --> 00:46:36.143]  Everything we're built on and they do it all the time.
[00:46:37.564 --> 00:46:45.108]  37.10 Penal Code says it's a felony for anyone to secret a government document from the person or department it's directed to.
[00:46:45.748 --> 00:46:48.029]  Got the judge dead bang.
[00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:49.030]  What happened to him?
[00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:50.631]  Oh, nothing yet.
[00:46:51.951 --> 00:46:54.333]  I filed 30 complaints with the magistrate.
[00:46:55.342 --> 00:47:00.624]  He took the complaints, and one of them was that complaint of secreting documents from the clerk.
[00:47:01.465 --> 00:47:08.488]  He sent them all back to me with a note saying he examined into my allegations and found no probable cause, so he returned them to me.
[00:47:09.868 --> 00:47:10.469]  Moron!
[00:47:10.489 --> 00:47:11.229]  Didn't you read it?
[00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:14.190]  Now I file 30 felons against you!
[00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:19.593]  Eventually, we'll move out of Williamson County into the federal court.
[00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:23.872]  We'll get them out of their local venue.
[00:47:24.433 --> 00:47:26.577]  I'm getting them to violate what I can.
[00:47:26.637 --> 00:47:28.380]  So it builds a case as they violate.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.021]  Exactly.
[00:47:29.422 --> 00:47:31.225]  It's the Tar Baby Syndrome.
[00:47:32.372 --> 00:47:36.354]  First guy screws up, everybody who touches it sticks to it.
[00:47:37.335 --> 00:47:45.799]  I filed two felonies, eight class A misdemeanors, I'm sorry, I will be filing, against every jailer who was in the jail at the time.
[00:47:45.819 --> 00:47:47.000]  Whatever happened to the young man?
[00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.121]  Still in there?
[00:47:49.141 --> 00:47:59.687]  Five months later, after I filed a writ of habeas corpus in his behalf, I got a call from someone who said, are you, Randall Kelton at CSM, are you Danny Schill's attorney?
[00:47:59.747 --> 00:48:00.728]  No, I'm not an attorney.
[00:48:01.528 --> 00:48:03.872]  Did you file a writ of habeas corpus on Danny Shull's behalf?
[00:48:03.913 --> 00:48:04.514]  Yes, I did.
[00:48:04.534 --> 00:48:09.102]  Do you mind if I ask what your relationship with Mr. Shulls is?
[00:48:09.583 --> 00:48:09.863]  Sure.
[00:48:10.164 --> 00:48:11.887]  I don't have a relationship with Mr. Shulls.
[00:48:12.107 --> 00:48:12.728]  Never met the man.
[00:48:13.717 --> 00:48:20.282]  There's this long pause, and she said, uh, well, uh, do you mind if I ask what your business with Mr. Schultz is?
[00:48:20.882 --> 00:48:21.683]  Yes, I do.
[00:48:22.523 --> 00:48:25.405]  I have business with Mr. Schultz, and it's none of yours.
[00:48:26.026 --> 00:48:30.409]  The next week, they took him into court, dismissed all the charges, put him on the street.
[00:48:30.429 --> 00:48:30.950]  Okay, here we go.
[00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.450]  We're going live.
[00:48:37.793 --> 00:48:41.175]  I was talking to Randy Kelton in the behind the scenes of PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:48:41.215 --> 00:48:51.500]  He was just telling me about one case in Texas where they pull a young guy over, claim he's drinking, and he was in jail five months without a charge, without a name, without a hearing.
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.821]  And I hear about this all the time.
[00:48:52.841 --> 00:48:53.762]  I see it in the news now.
[00:48:54.502 --> 00:49:00.645]  Where they just grab you and throw you in jail, and you had to go file criminal charges, habeas corpus documents, all of this.
[00:49:01.065 --> 00:49:03.687]  This isn't just Abu Ghraib people getting flown to Camp X-Ray.
[00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:04.567]  I mean, U.S.
[00:49:04.607 --> 00:49:07.749]  citizens now, it's not even a contempt charge.
[00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:10.070]  They just say, we just put you in jail now.
[00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:13.912]  I mean, that is the opposite of what our country is based on.
[00:49:14.152 --> 00:49:14.732]  Exactly.
[00:49:15.913 --> 00:49:18.234]  The document I filed, the writ of habeas corpus,
[00:49:20.336 --> 00:49:33.170]  stipulates how every step from arrest to trial as presently practiced in Texas is not only wrong, it is very specifically against particular law.
[00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:38.276]  And to be clear though, you've been practicing and exposing things in Texas, but you've looked at it all over the country is the same.
[00:49:38.616 --> 00:49:44.824]  Everywhere I go, this writ of habeas corpus is written on Texas law, but it's based on federal law.
[00:49:44.884 --> 00:49:46.306]  It's essentially the same everywhere.
[00:49:46.786 --> 00:49:50.951]  Everywhere I go, people read it, they say the same thing's going on here.
[00:49:51.432 --> 00:49:55.637]  And everywhere I go, everybody says, my county is the most corrupt
[00:49:55.657 --> 00:49:56.677]  Well, here's an example.
[00:49:57.137 --> 00:50:02.819]  I got arrested protesting, and then they come to the door, and then they just took me away, because you don't have free speech in Austin.
[00:50:03.299 --> 00:50:08.321]  They pay $100,000 and $500,000 lawsuits every few weeks for arresting people at demonstrations.
[00:50:08.721 --> 00:50:10.102]  They just take our tax money and pay it.
[00:50:10.602 --> 00:50:11.142]  They don't care.
[00:50:11.602 --> 00:50:16.924]  They're still going to keep, they've got to stop that freedom, got to stop that free speech, or the public might wake up and take them all to prison.
[00:50:17.924 --> 00:50:23.085]  But they came to my jail cell, and they said, we want you to sign this, and it had all this big list of crimes I've committed to get out.
[00:50:23.145 --> 00:50:25.105]  I said, well this is a plea of guilt.
[00:50:25.966 --> 00:50:29.486]  And then years later, Mike Hanson got arrested, and he told me this, and I went and got the copy.
[00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:30.567]  They even gave it to me.
[00:50:30.607 --> 00:50:35.008]  I mean, the Soviets would torture you underground and show you a document and say, sign it.
[00:50:35.328 --> 00:50:38.028]  Here in America, they just say, the average idiot doesn't know.
[00:50:38.048 --> 00:50:44.009]  They go, here, sign your personal recognizance bond, and you're agreeing that you've committed drug dealing, drunken driving.
[00:50:44.509 --> 00:50:46.850]  You're agreeing to all these classes that you've committed a crime.
[00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:49.742]  Yeah, that's common practice.
[00:50:50.423 --> 00:50:55.070]  I mean, the government's just totally lawless, and do the cops know, and do the jailers know they're criminals?
[00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.551]  Yes.
[00:50:55.811 --> 00:50:56.151]  Oh, they do?
[00:50:56.372 --> 00:50:58.114]  And for the most part, they don't like it.
[00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:00.758]  It's not as bad as we think.
[00:51:01.179 --> 00:51:02.641]  There is a remedy out there.
[00:51:03.482 --> 00:51:19.271]  And while I don't blame the policeman, the remedy involves kicking him right square in his behind as hard as you can so he has plausible deniability to go to his boss and say, if you want to arrest this guy and take him to jail, you do it.
[00:51:20.072 --> 00:51:21.853]  I'm not having him take my bass boat.
[00:51:22.998 --> 00:51:25.260]  You accuse the individual of a crime.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.640]  Forget the guys at the top.
[00:51:27.061 --> 00:51:31.023]  Take that personal individual, accuse him of committing a criminal act.
[00:51:31.344 --> 00:51:33.865]  When he commits a criminal act, he loses his immunity.
[00:51:34.426 --> 00:51:35.686]  You can sue him personally.
[00:51:35.807 --> 00:51:36.347]  I know, yeah.
[00:51:36.847 --> 00:51:38.648]  Now you put him under threat.
[00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:45.193]  When I file against every jailer in the jail in Williamson County for following policy, they're going to say, what?
[00:51:45.613 --> 00:51:46.113]  What did I do?
[00:51:47.074 --> 00:51:49.595]  And I'm going to say, you touched the tar baby, Bubba!
[00:51:49.995 --> 00:51:56.377]  Now, I want to get into, first off, you've had quite a few victories now, and then in the 30 minutes we've got left, let's get into what you do.
[00:51:56.677 --> 00:51:59.358]  And I'd like to have you back, Randy, you're really a great guy and we appreciate you coming in.
[00:52:01.199 --> 00:52:02.079]  You've had some victories.
[00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:02.980]  Yes, I have.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:11.603]  The writ we spoke of earlier, the one I filed in Danny Shull's behalf, I filed it with a local district judge, they stopped a murder trial.
[00:52:12.603 --> 00:52:16.167]  To hear it, and the judge threw me out of the courtroom because I wasn't an attorney.
[00:52:16.988 --> 00:52:23.895]  So I prepared criminal charges against the judge, and then filed the writ with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
[00:52:24.636 --> 00:52:25.537]  Highest court in Texas.
[00:52:26.398 --> 00:52:29.922]  They insisted that I file a motion for leave to file.
[00:52:31.163 --> 00:52:33.145]  Then they denied me leave to file.
[00:52:34.298 --> 00:52:39.141]  Well, Rid of Habeas Corpus is the only court filing mentioned in Constitution.
[00:52:39.702 --> 00:52:41.103]  It's a writ of right.
[00:52:42.524 --> 00:52:43.164]  The Great Writ.
[00:52:43.444 --> 00:52:44.245]  The Great Writ.
[00:52:45.225 --> 00:52:49.548]  They denied me permission to exercise a constitutional right.
[00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:53.451]  I see that as official oppression, a class A misdemeanor in Texas.
[00:52:53.871 --> 00:53:00.015]  I went down to the bailiff of the grand jury and I told the bailiff, instruct the foreman I have business with the grand jury.
[00:53:01.036 --> 00:53:10.924]  Instead of instructing the foreman, she called the district attorney, who came down and insisted that this was the grand jury's last day, and their calendar's full, they just will not have time to hear your complaint.
[00:53:11.724 --> 00:53:13.866]  But if you'll give it to me, I'll give it to the next grand jury.
[00:53:14.526 --> 00:53:21.912]  And I told her, make sure you do, because if you don't, you'll start a fight with me and you that I don't want to have.
[00:53:22.813 --> 00:53:24.434]  She did not give it to the grand jury.
[00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.696]  So I came back to the grand jury,
[00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:50.471]  with and told the bailiff instruct the foreman I have business with the grand jury instead she called the district attorney and handed me the phone said this is the district attorney she wants to talk to you I said if you look at those complaints you'll find their complaints against the district attorney she's a criminal I don't talk to criminals and the bailiff took the phone back and uh... we've got this on on video
[00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:55.953]  Uh, he said he can't talk to you because you're the criminal and he don't talk to criminals.
[00:53:57.234 --> 00:54:02.956]  She came out anyway and stopped me from filing criminal complaints against herself with the grand jury.
[00:54:03.276 --> 00:54:07.658]  And now, that is a conflict of interest, obstruction of justice, and a bunch of other things.
[00:54:07.718 --> 00:54:08.899]  That is so horrendous.
[00:54:08.939 --> 00:54:09.519]  What else is it?
[00:54:10.199 --> 00:54:16.322]  It's official oppression, it's shielding from prosecution, and she brought someone with a pistol.
[00:54:16.902 --> 00:54:17.723]  Aggravated assault.
[00:54:18.411 --> 00:54:20.953]  Oh my God, these people are absolutely out of their minds.
[00:54:20.973 --> 00:54:21.633]  We'll be right back.
[00:54:22.634 --> 00:54:23.515]  We're on the march.
[00:54:24.155 --> 00:54:24.636]  Keep going.
[00:54:24.816 --> 00:54:26.337]  Yeah, that's how it gets worse.
[00:54:26.957 --> 00:54:28.238]  And literally I set him up.
[00:54:29.279 --> 00:54:31.661]  I was sure that the prosecutor would stop me.
[00:54:32.741 --> 00:54:34.923]  So I could come back with charges against her.
[00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:37.445]  I didn't expect her to stop me with charges against her.
[00:54:38.145 --> 00:54:38.766]  But she did.
[00:54:39.386 --> 00:54:44.330]  So from there I went to the head criminal district judge in Travis County.
[00:54:45.871 --> 00:54:54.018]  Petitioned him for a court of inquiry to examine into her actions and presented him with three criminal complaints, which he refused to take.
[00:54:55.119 --> 00:54:59.222]  Said the district court in Travis County doesn't take criminal charges.
[00:54:59.783 --> 00:55:03.085]  I said, well, I'm not approaching you in your capacity as a district judge.
[00:55:03.145 --> 00:55:09.210]  I'm approaching you in your capacity as a magistrate in Texas, and that's a duty from which you may not shield yourself.
[00:55:10.211 --> 00:55:11.112]  Well, he did.
[00:55:12.373 --> 00:55:14.535]  So I filed criminal charges against him.
[00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:22.271]  And then came back a second time and filed the same petition for court of inquiry with another district judge.
[00:55:23.871 --> 00:55:26.952]  This one found out what I was doing with the first and he took it.
[00:55:28.393 --> 00:55:34.395]  He sent it to the district clerk who sent it to the county attorney to look into it for him.
[00:55:34.415 --> 00:55:36.595]  He couldn't send it to the district attorney because he was accused.
[00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:40.897]  I went to the county attorney and filed three criminal charges against Claire Brown.
[00:55:42.308 --> 00:55:50.274]  And went back to the district attorney's office, demanded the complaints I had given to her against the Court of Criminal Appeals judges.
[00:55:51.135 --> 00:55:53.797]  She brought them to me and I got an opportunity to talk to her.
[00:55:55.378 --> 00:55:57.299]  Told her, I'm not after you, Claire.
[00:55:57.379 --> 00:55:58.520]  I never was after you.
[00:55:59.721 --> 00:56:02.983]  If you will just stand aside, let me hand these to the grand jury.
[00:56:03.003 --> 00:56:05.846]  Then you go in there and talk them out of indicting.
[00:56:07.046 --> 00:56:07.867]  Everybody wins.
[00:56:08.848 --> 00:56:10.249]  The judges don't get indicted.
[00:56:11.207 --> 00:56:14.169]  I get them presented to the grand jury and you get to be the hero.
[00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:16.791]  She bought that story.
[00:56:17.691 --> 00:56:19.873]  They're in the hands of the grand jury as we speak.
[00:56:20.273 --> 00:56:24.716]  If this grand jury doesn't indict, I got twelve a year that I'll file with.
[00:56:25.774 --> 00:56:26.755]  I'll eventually get them.
[00:56:27.895 --> 00:56:31.758]  When I get all the justice of the Court of Criminal Appeals, everything changes.
[00:56:32.298 --> 00:56:33.959]  They get indicted, they're removed from office.
[00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:44.406]  But I know about lots of other people's cases where somebody has been arrested for no driver's license and you give them procedures, just basic stuff, and the court finally doesn't make a plea bargain and just dismisses it.
[00:56:44.686 --> 00:56:46.027]  And we see lots of that too.
[00:56:46.047 --> 00:56:48.549]  Yes, that's because the writ of habeas corpus
[00:56:49.509 --> 00:56:53.651]  It demonstrates all the acts that they commit that are criminal.
[00:56:54.211 --> 00:56:57.812]  So I took Rita Habeas Corpus apart and broke it into a bunch of motions.
[00:56:58.293 --> 00:57:08.477]  I maintain that when the officer arrests you, searches you, cuffs you, stuffs you, cranks the automobile, points it toward the jail, he has committed aggravated kidnapping.
[00:57:09.457 --> 00:57:12.158]  There's no false imprisonment statute in Texas.
[00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:15.620]  The statute is kidnapping.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.781]  When he arrested you, he could have arrested you legally.
[00:57:19.537 --> 00:57:26.084]  But when he pointed toward the jail instead of some magistrate's office, he violated law relating to his office, he became a criminal treasurer.
[00:57:26.104 --> 00:57:32.530]  Because you're supposed to immediately go before the magistrate so that you can then present your basic Bill of Rights.
[00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:33.251]  Exactly.
[00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:34.933]  Hold on, let's explain that right now.
[00:57:45.689 --> 00:57:47.070]  Randy Kelton's our guest.
[00:57:47.391 --> 00:57:49.072]  He's had a lot of effect in the courts.
[00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.954]  I've seen him have some victories, get some people out of things they hadn't done.
[00:57:53.415 --> 00:57:57.999]  When lawyers wanted $20,000, he was able, with basic procedures, to have them just drop the cases.
[00:57:58.019 --> 00:58:02.022]  I mean, it's one big, giant, corrupt system.
[00:58:02.683 --> 00:58:06.226]  And Randy, we were talking during the last break there for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:58:06.546 --> 00:58:09.528]  We were just now getting into the procedures.
[00:58:10.289 --> 00:58:13.471]  The police officer in the old days took you before a judge first.
[00:58:14.392 --> 00:58:25.317]  And it was always over rustling, or horse thieving, or rape, or something serious, but they still had to bring you before a judge, before the jail, where they could hold you maybe for a day before you went before a judge when the judge came in.
[00:58:25.337 --> 00:58:26.638]  It was on the weekend or at night.
[00:58:27.278 --> 00:58:30.239]  And now they'll just take you for weeks, months in jail without even charges.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:36.862]  That is kidnapping, that is official oppression, that is grade A tyranny, but all of this has just been standardized.
[00:58:36.882 --> 00:58:37.743]  But here's another example.
[00:58:40.034 --> 00:58:42.595]  Somebody steals your car, they won't come out and look into it.
[00:58:42.635 --> 00:58:45.176]  If you want to go file a report, they won't even let you.
[00:58:45.196 --> 00:58:52.999]  If you want to file charges on somebody who's knocked your teeth out, they'll just act like, well, come back later, or I can't do that, or go here.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:59:01.263]  They don't let you know that they have to file that, and then if you turn out to be a liar, you get arrested for filing false charges.
[00:59:02.063 --> 00:59:03.744]  And so it's the same thing with grand juries.
[00:59:03.784 --> 00:59:05.325]  Grand juries used to be creatures of the people.
[00:59:05.765 --> 00:59:06.326]  They were open.
[00:59:06.346 --> 00:59:07.146]  They were discussed.
[00:59:07.526 --> 00:59:09.187]  Now they've become creatures of the prosecutors.
[00:59:09.308 --> 00:59:11.429]  Everything has been domesticated.
[00:59:11.869 --> 00:59:12.950]  So let's talk about that.
[00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.270]  I mean, when
[00:59:16.783 --> 00:59:25.710]  You know, I've gone down many years ago, ten, twelve years ago, when I had stalkers and people breaking my car and doing stuff, being in my backyard, and I'd go to them and they'd say, look, you don't like us cops.
[00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:28.512]  I'm not going to file a thing on him for you.
[00:59:28.953 --> 00:59:29.893]  Just get out of my office.
[00:59:30.594 --> 00:59:31.655]  And I was just like, whoa!
[00:59:31.675 --> 00:59:32.996]  And that was down here in Austin.
[00:59:33.416 --> 00:59:34.757]  And that's when I really started waking up.
[00:59:34.817 --> 00:59:44.383]  I mean, I'd grown up in Dallas where our sheriff would jail for being a drug dealer, and I'd seen all kinds of crazy stuff and knew it was all a joke, but I mean, this really is, these are hardcore crooks.
[00:59:44.443 --> 00:59:47.766]  I mean, you're saying your normal officer isn't like that on the ground.
[00:59:47.786 --> 00:59:56.051]  I know they're just out writing tickets and raising revenue and helping people occasionally, but higher up, I mean, it does seem to get more rotten as you get higher up the fish.
[00:59:56.792 --> 01:00:00.734]  You know, it rots from the head down, but I mean, Randy, that's a lot I've said, but comments on that.
[01:00:01.054 --> 01:00:02.796]  It goes to the law of credulence.
[01:00:03.676 --> 01:00:05.238]  Crud sinks to the top.
[01:00:06.179 --> 01:00:08.481]  You have to be a scoundrel to ever get there.
[01:00:09.422 --> 01:00:13.726]  And I'm not saying all police are lily white angels.
[01:00:14.186 --> 01:00:20.092]  There are a number of police out there who got into police work for reasons that should have kept them out of police work.
[01:00:20.672 --> 01:00:24.016]  But for the most part, they got into police work wanting to be a good guy.
[01:00:24.536 --> 01:00:27.919]  They found themselves trapped in this situation, this
[01:00:29.079 --> 01:00:30.060]  But then he gets promoted!
[01:00:46.494 --> 01:00:48.215]  He's the one that gets promoted.
[01:00:48.315 --> 01:00:54.239]  I've literally seen them pull people who are quadriplegics out and beat them up because they couldn't get out of the car fast enough.
[01:00:54.739 --> 01:00:55.980]  And then that guy gets promoted.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:56.981]  Exactly.
[01:00:57.361 --> 01:00:58.582]  There is a technique.
[01:00:59.342 --> 01:01:02.344]  And mostly it's getting away from the guy at the bottom.
[01:01:03.445 --> 01:01:08.588]  If a guy at the bottom gives me a problem, or if I have a complaint to file, I never file it with the police.
[01:01:09.468 --> 01:01:10.449]  I go file it with a judge.
[01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:13.291]  And if the judge refuses to take it,
[01:01:14.093 --> 01:01:14.734]  Wonderful!
[01:01:15.654 --> 01:01:19.657]  Now I get to go to the district attorney and file criminal charges against the judge.
[01:01:21.459 --> 01:01:23.760]  And the district attorney is not even going to take that.
[01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:27.623]  Now I get to file criminal charges directly with the grand jury.
[01:01:28.424 --> 01:01:31.206]  And there's a number of innovative ways to get that.
[01:01:31.586 --> 01:01:35.649]  The grand jury is still as powerful as it always has been.
[01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:39.873]  It's just that the officials have gotten better at hiding them from us.
[01:01:41.038 --> 01:01:42.359]  They hate grand juries.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:44.761]  Oh, no, they want to abolish them and regular juries.
[01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:47.123]  You bet they want to abolish grand juries.
[01:01:47.423 --> 01:01:55.550]  My district attorney in Wise County once told me, those damn grand jury members, they think what they're doing is important.
[01:01:56.131 --> 01:01:57.312]  I said, well, Barry, it is.
[01:01:57.332 --> 01:02:03.337]  I know that, but I wish they didn't, because he never knows what they're going to do.
[01:02:03.757 --> 01:02:06.840]  Well, I mean, I want to get into your solutions here, and how you do it.
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:15.948]  We've talked some about that on your website, but go back to Williamson County a few months ago, because you go to file this complaint on somebody's rights that are violated, and tell them what they did to you behind closed doors.
[01:02:16.089 --> 01:02:21.794]  Well, when the investigator came out and told me that the district attorney... Tell them what department this was.
[01:02:21.834 --> 01:02:22.535]  Go through it all.
[01:02:22.555 --> 01:02:23.636]  I went to the district attorney.
[01:02:24.557 --> 01:02:26.979]  Hank handed his investigator a criminal complaint.
[01:02:27.559 --> 01:02:30.642]  If you go to the district attorney with a complaint, they'll always send you an investigator.
[01:02:30.662 --> 01:02:31.703]  So this is Round Rock or?
[01:02:32.023 --> 01:02:33.744]  This was Georgetown.
[01:02:33.905 --> 01:02:35.926]  Okay, Georgetown City District Attorney, okay.
[01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:38.588]  No, went to the county courthouse.
[01:02:38.648 --> 01:02:41.931]  Okay, I want to be clear, he went to the county of Williamson County?
[01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:44.613]  The county, the elected district attorney.
[01:02:44.853 --> 01:02:45.634]  Got it, county seat.
[01:02:45.754 --> 01:02:47.356]  Yeah, I wanted the highest one in the city.
[01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:49.197]  Got it, I just didn't know what jurisdiction, go ahead.
[01:02:49.477 --> 01:02:53.961]  Complaints against public officials always go to a district attorney, even if it's a Class C misdemeanor.
[01:02:55.066 --> 01:02:55.426]  By law.
[01:02:56.087 --> 01:02:57.227]  So, I file the complaint.
[01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:59.249]  I try to file it with a district attorney.
[01:02:59.269 --> 01:03:00.990]  When you try to do that, they'll never talk to you.
[01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:02.451]  They'll send out their investigator.
[01:03:03.051 --> 01:03:04.812]  So, I got this trick for them.
[01:03:05.373 --> 01:03:06.654]  I make up a criminal complaint.
[01:03:07.714 --> 01:03:10.016]  And I ask the investigator, are you a certified police officer?
[01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:10.836]  And he said, yes I am.
[01:03:10.997 --> 01:03:11.817]  Good, I need you.
[01:03:12.077 --> 01:03:13.798]  Here, take this complaint and verify it.
[01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:15.720]  And it's a complaint against his boss.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.441]  And he'll say, well, I can't verify that.
[01:03:19.101 --> 01:03:22.262]  If you're a certified police officer, you're authorized to verify criminal affidavits.
[01:03:22.602 --> 01:03:23.262]  Verify that.
[01:03:23.803 --> 01:03:28.164]  The first thing he does is goes to his boss, because he's not even signing that document.
[01:03:28.585 --> 01:03:29.445]  So that gets rid of him.
[01:03:30.345 --> 01:03:37.228]  Well, he went to talk to the boss and came back and said, the boss declined my offer to file criminal charges against this other police officer.
[01:03:38.206 --> 01:03:44.250]  And I told him I hate to hear that and took out my cell phone, dialed 911, asked him to send an officer out here to arrest the both of them.
[01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:50.133]  Class A misdemeanor, official misconduct, violation 39.03 Penal Code.
[01:03:50.433 --> 01:03:51.474]  I'll swear out the complaint.
[01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:52.215]  I'll wait.
[01:03:52.535 --> 01:03:54.196]  And that's the thing, they break the law
[01:03:55.836 --> 01:04:00.898]  Go back and explain that when they drive you to the jail, instead of imagining... Explain that.
[01:04:00.918 --> 01:04:02.578]  It's just all crime.
[01:04:03.138 --> 01:04:08.280]  It was intended by our founders that the people not have a reason to fear their police.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:12.561]  This was born out of the British running around arresting their own people for no reason.
[01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:16.082]  This thing of magistrates comes from Magna Carta.
[01:04:16.542 --> 01:04:16.642]  The 1200s.
[01:04:16.662 --> 01:04:18.323]  There was a good idea.
[01:04:18.343 --> 01:04:18.583]  They said,
[01:04:21.664 --> 01:04:24.025]  The policeman should not have the key to the jailhouse door.
[01:04:24.665 --> 01:04:28.607]  You can arrest somebody, but you take him directly to a magistrate and you explain yourself.
[01:04:28.767 --> 01:04:29.667]  Separation of powers.
[01:04:29.847 --> 01:04:36.550]  And it's not because they don't trust the policeman, but they want you to feel like the policeman didn't arrest and imprison.
[01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:40.251]  That he can arrest, but he's going to take you to somebody else and explain himself.
[01:04:40.311 --> 01:04:41.651]  And that also gives him protection.
[01:04:41.872 --> 01:04:42.352]  Exactly.
[01:04:43.152 --> 01:04:45.053]  So, in Wise County, they do that now.
[01:04:45.593 --> 01:04:46.453]  And the police like it.
[01:04:46.513 --> 01:04:47.454]  So you've made them do that?
[01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:47.754]  Yes.
[01:04:48.574 --> 01:04:50.995]  It kind of came about, took a long time, but they finally do that.
[01:04:51.416 --> 01:04:52.496]  Everybody likes it better.
[01:04:53.176 --> 01:04:57.078]  I never hear anyone in Wise County tell me about the police being jackbooted thugs.
[01:04:57.998 --> 01:04:59.279]  Just changed their whole perspective.
[01:04:59.899 --> 01:05:04.701]  The policeman likes it better, the magistrate likes it better, even the prosecutor likes it better.
[01:05:05.021 --> 01:05:08.723]  Because the magistrate throws out a lot of cases so he don't have to deal with them.
[01:05:09.463 --> 01:05:11.284]  But that's what they were supposed to do.
[01:05:12.224 --> 01:05:14.925]  But over a period of time... Just get lazy!
[01:05:15.705 --> 01:05:23.707]  Well, I think the real problem is the legislature told the prosecutor to give advice to the lower courts and the police.
[01:05:24.528 --> 01:05:28.769]  That's a prescription for exactly the disaster we see today.
[01:05:29.409 --> 01:05:35.811]  You think the prosecutor is going to say to the judge, well, I think you should do this here because it will make my life a living hell.
[01:05:36.681 --> 01:05:42.606]  No, he's going to advise them to do things that make the prosecution flow more efficiently.
[01:05:43.367 --> 01:05:52.635]  And over time, we gravitate away from... And now everything's plea bargain, and now they'll throw you in jail for five months before they even charge you, so they don't even have to make you plea bargain.
[01:05:53.177 --> 01:05:56.801]  I looked at the criminal court records in the county I live in.
[01:05:56.841 --> 01:05:57.742]  I was looking at one of them.
[01:05:57.762 --> 01:05:59.804]  There's nothing in there but the indictment and the deal.
[01:06:00.465 --> 01:06:01.566]  You can't tell he's been arrested.
[01:06:01.586 --> 01:06:02.387]  You can't tell anything.
[01:06:02.987 --> 01:06:04.489]  In the deal, he got 457 days time served.
[01:06:04.509 --> 01:06:08.133]  He sat in jail 457 days before they could squeeze a deal out of him.
[01:06:11.896 --> 01:06:14.097]  No judge, no jury.
[01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:16.517]  You just go right to jail and they're gone.
[01:06:16.658 --> 01:06:19.838]  And not even any record at the court that you exist.
[01:06:20.299 --> 01:06:21.299]  He can't file motions.
[01:06:21.339 --> 01:06:22.039]  He can't do anything.
[01:06:22.059 --> 01:06:23.019]  He's in a legal limbo.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.201]  And that's because the magistrate doesn't send the records to the clerk.
[01:06:27.861 --> 01:06:28.941]  But back to the policeman.
[01:06:29.121 --> 01:06:31.362]  When he arrests you, he's supposed to take you to that magistrate.
[01:06:32.402 --> 01:06:43.769]  And, according to federal law, his only defense against an allegation of false imprisonment for failure to timely take before a magistrate is a showing of due diligence and effort to locate.
[01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:50.933]  When he gets in that car, cranks that car, points it toward the jail as a matter of policy, that's aggravated kidnapping by definition.
[01:06:51.673 --> 01:06:53.374]  He violated a law relating to his office.
[01:06:54.335 --> 01:06:57.377]  His acts became false imprisonment, which is
[01:06:58.377 --> 01:07:04.241]  In Texas, it's called kidnapping, and he did it whilst displaying a deadly weapon that makes it aggravated kidnapping.
[01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:06.723]  He took me and gave me to the jailers.
[01:07:07.643 --> 01:07:09.905]  They continued the kidnapping.
[01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:11.766]  They touched the tar baby.
[01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.627]  They don't just exceed their authority.
[01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:16.309]  Now, what do you do about police now?
[01:07:16.329 --> 01:07:24.074]  A lot of them seem to think that they'll go ahead of you, argue with them, and taser you, and then they bump their chest into you, or don't even do that now, and just charge you with assaulting them.
[01:07:24.434 --> 01:07:25.675]  What would you do with a case like that?
[01:07:25.915 --> 01:07:26.756]  That's what happened to me.
[01:07:28.268 --> 01:07:29.509]  And that's why they arrested me.
[01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:32.831]  And I was really upset when they dismissed the charges.
[01:07:33.452 --> 01:07:35.173]  I wanted him on the stand.
[01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:40.537]  On the stand, I'd elicit perjured testimony and ask that judge to have him arrested immediately.
[01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:46.601]  But they arrested me and took me into a... The first day, they went into this conference room.
[01:07:46.621 --> 01:07:48.062]  I gave them a complaint.
[01:07:48.082 --> 01:07:49.663]  Oh yeah, finish up with what happened in Williamson County.
[01:07:49.683 --> 01:07:51.044]  The assault began.
[01:07:51.164 --> 01:07:52.485]  Yeah, I gave them a complaint.
[01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:53.206]  Okay, yeah, go ahead.
[01:07:53.866 --> 01:07:55.948]  And he said the complaint was insufficient.
[01:07:57.173 --> 01:08:00.383]  I said, well, thank you anyway, but I don't need any legal advice.
[01:08:01.474 --> 01:08:07.518]  And they got real excited about that, and started grilling me, and I finally told them this interview's over.
[01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:10.560]  And started to leave, and they grabbed me and threw me in a chair.
[01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:12.842]  Just total third world country.
[01:08:12.862 --> 01:08:12.922]  Yes.
[01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:17.625]  Reached for my cell phone, he grabbed my arm, twisted it, ripped my cell phone out of my hand.
[01:08:18.346 --> 01:08:20.628]  I told him, I need that to call 9-1-1.
[01:08:21.228 --> 01:08:22.849]  They said, we are 9-1-1.
[01:08:22.929 --> 01:08:23.209]  No!
[01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:24.971]  You're jackbooted thugs!
[01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:25.631]  I need 9-1-1!
[01:08:28.633 --> 01:08:31.995]  By that time, Michael Badnerik was there.
[01:08:32.035 --> 01:08:35.858]  He kind of backed up in a corner.
[01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:38.220]  You're witness to this vampiric behavior.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:38.580]  Yes.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:43.983]  The third time they threw me in the chair, the police officer had his hand on my chest, pushing me backwards.
[01:08:44.784 --> 01:08:47.506]  I reached up and pushed his hand off and they arrested me for assault.
[01:08:47.786 --> 01:08:50.368]  So they assault you, and if you defend yourself, you're all good.
[01:08:50.588 --> 01:08:51.008]  Exactly.
[01:08:51.268 --> 01:08:52.049]  So where's that going?
[01:08:52.069 --> 01:08:52.569]  They've dropped it?
[01:08:52.889 --> 01:08:54.431]  They've dropped it, and I'm upset about it.
[01:08:55.211 --> 01:08:57.894]  The prosecuting attorney dropped the charge.
[01:08:57.994 --> 01:09:00.656]  What a circus behind closed doors with these crazies!
[01:09:01.297 --> 01:09:02.718]  Well, they're not done yet.
[01:09:02.858 --> 01:09:04.760]  Actually, Debra helped me out on this one.
[01:09:05.621 --> 01:09:10.706]  I went to the county attorney because they dropped the interfering with the public servant charge.
[01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:18.693]  And I had went to the court clerk, and there's no record with the court clerk that I was ever arrested, so I asked the prosecuting attorney
[01:09:19.895 --> 01:09:21.136]  Who dropped these charges?
[01:09:21.196 --> 01:09:22.037]  He said, well, I did.
[01:09:22.797 --> 01:09:24.619]  Well, how did you manage to drop them?
[01:09:24.999 --> 01:09:27.081]  There's no record in the court clerk they exist.
[01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:30.843]  Well, I dropped them in my capacity as a prosecuting attorney.
[01:09:31.424 --> 01:09:44.774]  I told him, well, that's all well and good, but I was hoping for something more specific, like a 32.02 Code of Criminal Procedure, which says a prosecuting attorney may not dismiss a prosecution except by submission of written motion to the court of jurisdiction laying down cause for said dismissal.
[01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:45.415]  Why they did it?
[01:09:45.455 --> 01:09:47.496]  Because for all we know, he could have been paid off to do it.
[01:09:47.856 --> 01:09:48.557]  Gotta have a record.
[01:09:48.797 --> 01:09:50.058]  Yeah, so where the heck did you get this?
[01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:54.423]  He said, well, a prosecution never started because I refused to take it.
[01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:55.444]  I said, wait a minute.
[01:09:56.005 --> 01:09:58.147]  I thought I spent 29 hours in your jail.
[01:09:58.468 --> 01:10:07.337]  And as I read the case law, a prosecution commences when a person is arrested or a criminal complaint is presented to a magistrate, which had to be, for him to find probable cause.
[01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:09.560]  So a prosecution commenced
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:11.821]  You dismissed it.
[01:10:11.921 --> 01:10:13.722]  How did you even know it existed?
[01:10:14.062 --> 01:10:17.404]  Because the magistrate was supposed to send the records to the court clerk.
[01:10:17.805 --> 01:10:18.585]  How did you know?
[01:10:18.625 --> 01:10:19.966]  The court clerk doesn't have them.
[01:10:20.526 --> 01:10:26.150]  So whoever has them, has them in violation of 3710 Penal Code and they're committing a felony.
[01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:27.191]  Have you got those records?
[01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:30.092]  And he looked like a cat with a feather in his mouth.
[01:10:30.792 --> 01:10:33.314]  And Debra was standing behind me.
[01:10:33.714 --> 01:10:35.435]  Debra, that's my co-host, Debra Stevens.
[01:10:36.035 --> 01:10:40.457]  She stepped up and said, Randy, aren't you talking about the records that were supposed to go to the Magistrate?
[01:10:40.477 --> 01:10:41.217]  And I said, yes.
[01:10:41.818 --> 01:10:43.719]  Well, look at that folder he's got in his hand there.
[01:10:43.999 --> 01:10:45.319]  Isn't that those records?
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.021]  And this prosecutor looked like he wanted a hole to crawl in.
[01:10:49.381 --> 01:10:52.583]  And she said, are any of those records in there from the Magistrate?
[01:10:53.643 --> 01:10:54.964]  Well, yes, one of them.
[01:10:55.624 --> 01:10:57.365]  And Debra shut up, stepped back.
[01:10:58.632 --> 01:11:03.095]  And for Debra to stop talking abruptly, I thought that was rather strange, and I looked back at her.
[01:11:03.375 --> 01:11:05.737]  It wasn't until later I realized what she had done.
[01:11:06.738 --> 01:11:09.299]  She got the prosecutor to cop to a felony.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:16.224]  And once she got it, she didn't pursue any more, so he wouldn't have a chance to talk his way out of it.
[01:11:17.004 --> 01:11:23.209]  So I'll be filing felony tampering with a government document against the prosecutor for having my records.
[01:11:24.212 --> 01:11:24.953]  Let him explain.
[01:11:24.973 --> 01:11:29.018]  But see, they love to have false charges and set up old ladies and young kids.
[01:11:29.739 --> 01:11:31.721]  They get to have some of their own sick medicine.
[01:11:32.061 --> 01:11:33.183]  But you're doing it within the law.
[01:11:33.343 --> 01:11:33.603]  Yes.
[01:11:33.803 --> 01:11:34.584]  Oh, they hate this.
[01:11:34.925 --> 01:11:38.268]  Because they know I will go directly to the grand jury.
[01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:43.531]  Now, whether I actually get to the grand jury or not is not so important.
[01:11:44.673 --> 01:11:49.337]  Just making grand jury noises scares the bejesus out of these guys.
[01:11:50.198 --> 01:11:52.781]  They see their career flash before their eyes.
[01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:56.064]  The odds are that I'm not going to get an indictment.
[01:11:57.873 --> 01:11:59.495]  Who wants to play Russian Roulette?
[01:12:19.597 --> 01:12:21.338]  And I just said, I said, you know, do what you need to.
[01:12:21.558 --> 01:12:26.922]  But I said, I'm not, I said, I'm a big fish and I'm going to sue you, you know, you can, you can beat the rap, but you're not going to beat the ride.
[01:12:27.382 --> 01:12:28.923]  And they just said, all right, you know, tough guy.
[01:12:28.944 --> 01:12:33.026]  They wouldn't put me in a cell with human feces everywhere when they had other cells that were clean.
[01:12:33.527 --> 01:12:35.368]  But I mean, who wants that type of power?
[01:12:35.448 --> 01:12:36.329]  I would be embarrassed.
[01:12:36.909 --> 01:12:46.596]  I mean, I'm not like mean to my employees on purpose for a personal power trip, but I guess that's who, let's admit it, in some cases that's who wants to be a cop or a judge.
[01:12:47.694 --> 01:12:48.755]  That's part of the problem.
[01:12:48.775 --> 01:12:51.677]  I mean, they really enjoy squeezing people.
[01:12:51.957 --> 01:12:53.138]  And I've had enough of it.
[01:12:53.859 --> 01:12:56.261]  There's a lot of them out there that aren't that way.
[01:12:56.961 --> 01:12:59.623]  We just have to give them an opportunity to stand up.
[01:13:00.063 --> 01:13:05.708]  And it's unfortunate, the way we give them that opportunity is kick them right square in their behind.
[01:13:06.288 --> 01:13:08.590]  I equate that to my grandchildren.
[01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:10.832]  I love my grandchildren dearly.
[01:13:11.552 --> 01:13:14.995]  But if one of them runs out on the road, I'm fixing tan his hide.
[01:13:17.003 --> 01:13:21.778]  When you do this kind of thing, I suggest that people don't go file complaints in your own case.
[01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:23.604]  You've got too much involved.
[01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:27.167]  If you want to find out how this works, go pick a fight.
[01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:28.969]  Or a traffic ticket.
[01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.211]  What are you going to lose at a traffic ticket?
[01:13:31.832 --> 01:13:35.095]  If you lose, they're going to do the same thing they would do to you anyway.
[01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:37.037]  So heck, there's nothing to lose.
[01:13:37.798 --> 01:13:39.519]  Traffic tickets are great fun.
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:42.362]  My last traffic ticket was in Bell County.
[01:13:43.123 --> 01:13:47.106]  I asked the bailiff to drag the judge down off the bench three different times.
[01:13:47.887 --> 01:13:51.410]  And they told the judge, get down off that bench, you're disqualified.
[01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:53.773]  He jumped up, clear the jury, clear the jury.
[01:13:54.353 --> 01:13:55.154]  It was a hoot.
[01:13:55.815 --> 01:13:56.535]  What happened there?
[01:13:57.316 --> 01:13:59.638]  Oh, the jury found me incredibly guilty.
[01:14:00.099 --> 01:14:00.679]  But I was.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:11.089]  I told them before we told the jury panel that these guys are going to get up here and they're going to put an officer up here and he's going to say that he clocked me doing 80 miles an hour in a 65 mile an hour zone.
[01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:12.370]  And he did.
[01:14:13.607 --> 01:14:14.287]  I was doing it.
[01:14:14.347 --> 01:14:15.628]  Well then why'd you do this case then?
[01:14:15.888 --> 01:14:17.988]  I'm here because they're bigger criminals than me.
[01:14:18.508 --> 01:14:23.810]  They have no authority to prosecute me because they're really the criminals and oh, the prosecutor had a fit.
[01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:25.290]  And so you did it as an educational?
[01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.590]  Yes.
[01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.911]  And then what did you teach the jury?
[01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:34.893]  I had a motion to disqualify the judge before the court and he turned it down himself.
[01:14:36.499 --> 01:14:37.239]  That's a crime.
[01:14:37.279 --> 01:14:38.980]  No, they have to let another judge look at that, don't they?
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.641]  Exactly.
[01:14:39.981 --> 01:14:42.802]  Motion to recuse the judge can deny himself.
[01:14:43.522 --> 01:14:45.684]  But a motion to disqualify, he cannot.
[01:14:46.544 --> 01:14:47.064]  But he did.
[01:14:47.084 --> 01:14:54.428]  And then after that, the first thing I did was ask the policeman when he signed his last oath of office.
[01:14:55.108 --> 01:14:56.089]  Prosecutor objected.
[01:14:56.926 --> 01:14:58.547]  The judge sustained.
[01:14:58.607 --> 01:15:01.770]  I said, Your Honor, I have a right to test the credibility of this witness.
[01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:04.612]  The judge said, Well, Mr. Kelton, this witness is credible.
[01:15:04.912 --> 01:15:06.733]  And just how did this witness become credible?
[01:15:07.134 --> 01:15:09.375]  He's credible because I say he's credible.
[01:15:10.116 --> 01:15:11.377]  Mr. Bailiff, did you hear that?
[01:15:11.957 --> 01:15:12.998]  Yes, Mr. Kelton, I did.
[01:15:13.018 --> 01:15:14.939]  Drag that judge down off that bench!
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:17.922]  Judge, you get down off that bench, you are disqualified!
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.841]  Alright, we're doing the break for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:21.322]  Tell us what happened.
[01:15:21.342 --> 01:15:22.562]  We'll come back, finish up.
[01:15:22.582 --> 01:15:24.944]  Tell folks, are you going to be having a seminar any time soon?
[01:15:25.544 --> 01:15:26.044]  I hope to.
[01:15:26.284 --> 01:15:28.626]  We don't have... Well good, well when that's coming up, we'll plug it here.
[01:15:28.926 --> 01:15:32.168]  We'll have you back on.
[01:15:33.469 --> 01:15:38.832]  Okay, go ahead and tell folks what happened in that case.
[01:15:40.032 --> 01:15:50.972]  Oh, they found me guilty, and then I went to the district attorney and tried to file criminal charges against the judge and the district attorney's investigator, who wouldn't identify himself.
[01:15:52.073 --> 01:15:59.219]  He threw me out of the building at gunpoint with two bailiffs and frankly I just haven't had time to go back and pursue them.
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:00.561]  I have.
[01:16:00.821 --> 01:16:06.626]  But I personally heard about some of your victories with helping other people and somebody in here running the show, you really helped him.
[01:16:06.786 --> 01:16:08.147]  I spent like ten grand trying to help him.
[01:16:08.167 --> 01:16:11.530]  They did nothing with normal lawyers and you got it done pretty quick.
[01:16:13.492 --> 01:16:15.514]  Tell us about, just real fast, some of the basic victories.
[01:16:15.936 --> 01:16:25.201]  Well, there was that one, three class B misdemeanors, and what I did was accuse the policeman of arresting him for exercising a constitutional right.
[01:16:25.241 --> 01:16:32.145]  When he told them he didn't want to talk to them anymore, they needed his attorney, rolled up his window, they arrested him for interfering with the public servant.
[01:16:32.705 --> 01:16:36.447]  I call that punishing someone for exercising a constitutional right.
[01:16:36.768 --> 01:16:37.488]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:37.648 --> 01:16:38.909]  What is that, the seventh?
[01:16:41.314 --> 01:16:41.654]  I forget.
[01:16:41.674 --> 01:16:44.615]  Which one is it, the right to counsel, or the fifth?
[01:16:44.895 --> 01:16:45.835]  It's also not the top.
[01:16:45.855 --> 01:16:48.076]  In Texas law, it would be Article 1, Paragraph 10.
[01:16:48.276 --> 01:16:48.836]  Okay.
[01:16:49.516 --> 01:16:58.038]  So, and the case law says, to punish someone for exercising a constitutional right is a due process violation of the most basic sort.
[01:16:58.978 --> 01:17:01.959]  So I charge the officers with aggravated kidnapping.
[01:17:03.154 --> 01:17:06.475]  False imprisonment, and then they took him to jail instead of a magistrate.
[01:17:06.915 --> 01:17:19.638]  I walked down that Rid of Habeas Corpus and charged everyone with a criminal act for every act, everyone with the criminal act of every other actor, including the prosecuting attorney and the judge.
[01:17:20.338 --> 01:17:26.320]  When the prosecutor got it, he looked at all these allegations and he said, I do not want to go here.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.941]  Because he did his homework, he went back and looked at the supporting law and found that it was right.
[01:17:34.361 --> 01:17:37.144]  Tell folks about what's happened in your own little county.
[01:17:37.644 --> 01:17:43.470]  You were saying you really... In Wise County, it took some 15 years.
[01:17:44.371 --> 01:17:51.159]  I never got, and this was my learning process, that's where I got my elbow broken, where the officer stove in three ribs.
[01:17:52.623 --> 01:18:02.848]  I stayed after the sheriff and the district attorney, the district judge, just harassed them with criminal complaints and they would hide from the grand jury.
[01:18:03.369 --> 01:18:07.491]  That's what taught me how to get around all these maneuvers they pulled.
[01:18:08.171 --> 01:18:13.634]  Never got anyone arrested, never got anyone indicted, but they changed everything.
[01:18:13.894 --> 01:18:14.874]  Well, it's the process.
[01:18:14.954 --> 01:18:20.917]  It's kind of like, out of hundreds of battles, only a handful were won by the revolutionary forces, but finally the British just were tired.
[01:18:21.297 --> 01:18:21.737]  Exactly.
[01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:22.918]  And you just teach them.
[01:18:22.938 --> 01:18:23.538]  You educate them.
[01:18:23.838 --> 01:18:25.379]  And they finally said, enough of this.
[01:18:25.879 --> 01:18:32.622]  The last time I spoke to my district judge in Wise County, I was in his courtroom talking to the bailiff.
[01:18:33.322 --> 01:18:37.404]  He ran in the courtroom and said, Mr. Kelton, you're creating a disturbance.
[01:18:37.424 --> 01:18:39.705]  You get out of this courthouse, or I'll have you arrested.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:45.484]  And I said, oh, gee, Judge, I'm sorry, and I reached in my pocket and pulled out this little digital tape recorder.
[01:18:46.144 --> 01:18:47.245]  I didn't have this turned on.
[01:18:47.285 --> 01:18:51.008]  I clicked the button and stuck it right in his face and said, will you say that again?
[01:18:51.028 --> 01:18:54.570]  And the judge looked at me like... Oh, let's go back on air.
[01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.770]  Okay.
[01:18:59.174 --> 01:19:00.635]  You were just telling me during the break about, um...
[01:19:02.532 --> 01:19:05.934]  In your own town with a judge threatening you and you pulled out the recorder.
[01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:09.597]  Yeah, all of them hate me except the county attorney.
[01:19:10.177 --> 01:19:11.498]  And I've been after him a long time.
[01:19:11.558 --> 01:19:13.639]  I never got anybody arrested in Wise County.
[01:19:13.819 --> 01:19:15.040]  Never got anybody indicted.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.342]  Never even got anyone presented to the grand jury.
[01:19:18.382 --> 01:19:22.125]  But they do take everyone they arrest directly to the nearest magistrate.
[01:19:23.188 --> 01:19:26.489]  And that's because I just kept harassing them.
[01:19:27.349 --> 01:19:31.390]  I didn't get them indicted, but I was always so close.
[01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.751]  They're literally playing Russian roulette with me.
[01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:38.052]  And I was just telling the story the last time I spoke to my district judge.
[01:19:38.572 --> 01:19:44.813]  I was in his courtroom, talking to his bailiff, and he ran in and said, Mr. Carlton, you're creating a disturbance.
[01:19:44.833 --> 01:19:47.054]  You get out of this courthouse, or I'll have you arrested.
[01:19:47.921 --> 01:19:50.802]  I reached in my pocket, I said, I'm sorry judge, I didn't have this turned on.
[01:19:50.882 --> 01:19:56.764]  Pulled out a little digital recorder, clicked it on, stuck it in his face, and said, will you say that again?
[01:19:56.784 --> 01:20:01.245]  And he looked at me, he was breathing hard, and I know what he was thinking.
[01:20:01.905 --> 01:20:05.446]  That damn district attorney, he didn't tell me everything.
[01:20:05.466 --> 01:20:07.287]  And the judge was right.
[01:20:08.027 --> 01:20:15.829]  I was talking to the bailiff because the high sheriff of the county sent me to talk to the bailiff in order to file criminal charges against the district attorney.
[01:20:17.259 --> 01:20:20.000]  The District Attorney told the judge I was creating a disturbance.
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:25.142]  I filed making a terroristic threat against the District Judge with the Attorney General.
[01:20:26.562 --> 01:20:35.025]  The only time the Attorney General is the prosecutor of original jurisdiction is in a matter of a complaint against a District Attorney under open records.
[01:20:35.605 --> 01:20:42.968]  But how did it get so corrupt all over the country where none of them follow proper procedure, none of them follow the state and federal law, they just do whatever they want?
[01:20:43.484 --> 01:20:47.184]  I have a document on my website I call the Frog Farm Conspiracy.
[01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:53.954]  Uh, and the reason I call it that is Samuel Clements once said, you take a frog, throw him in a pot of hot water, he'd jump out.
[01:20:54.734 --> 01:20:59.437]  Take that same frog, put him in a pot of cold water, gradually raise the heat.
[01:21:00.558 --> 01:21:17.890]  Well, over time, through a series of seemingly minor adjustments toward administrative convenience and adjudicative expediency, we took one little step after another outside the legal limits, and then one day we look around and wonder how we got in this mess.
[01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:27.155]  And it's bad, but on the other hand, because it's so bad, it gives us a lot more power in changing it.
[01:21:28.096 --> 01:21:32.238]  They are so far away from rule of law, they have zero defense.
[01:21:33.259 --> 01:21:35.680]  And all we have to do is keep hammering them.
[01:21:36.561 --> 01:21:38.062]  Right now, I'm just one person.
[01:21:39.303 --> 01:21:40.823]  And just one person.
[01:21:41.764 --> 01:21:46.307]  I've got all of the judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals wondering if they're going to get indicted.
[01:21:48.294 --> 01:21:51.675]  That's extremely powerful, even if I don't get them indicted.
[01:21:52.135 --> 01:21:53.015]  Well, I mean, here's an example.
[01:21:53.035 --> 01:21:55.336]  I want to hold you over five minutes, if we can, in the next hour.
[01:21:55.376 --> 01:22:04.098]  Then we're going to get Senator Karen Johnson on for a 50-plus minute interview and take calls, listeners, on 9-11 and all these big developments that have happened there.
[01:22:04.118 --> 01:22:07.119]  When we come back, I want you to answer this for me in the five minutes we've got left.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.060]  Here's an example of what we did.
[01:22:10.652 --> 01:22:30.716]  You know, with the absent student assistance program, ASAP, in 98-99, if your child didn't go to school one morning with the flu, and you had the flu or forgot to call, the police would come and demand in, threaten parents, they would arrest you, but truancy was 14 absences unexcused in a semester.
[01:22:31.456 --> 01:22:37.978]  So we went to the county commissioner's court and would read the law and say, and we found out that they would take three
[01:22:40.146 --> 01:22:40.686]  Uh, late.
[01:22:42.147 --> 01:22:45.289]  You know, sixth graders being late to class three times and call that an absence?
[01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:52.854]  And they would bring them into these little portable buildings and say, but it wasn't real court, we got video of it, they would just say, sign a document, we're signing them on to probation.
[01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:54.275]  Via contract fraud.
[01:22:54.695 --> 01:22:57.937]  And we cut back on some of that, now they're back with it, I mean, I can't fight everything.
[01:22:58.397 --> 01:23:00.259]  But the point is, it's not even laws.
[01:23:01.239 --> 01:23:02.781]  I mean, it's all fraud.
[01:23:02.801 --> 01:23:04.702]  So I'm not talking about contract fraud with you.
[01:23:04.802 --> 01:23:06.684]  You're talking about how to keep them accountable.
[01:23:06.724 --> 01:23:10.447]  I mean, just for the average public to know the government is criminal, stop trusting them.
[01:23:10.987 --> 01:23:14.210]  We'll be back in one minute.
[01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:15.931]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:24:24.797 --> 01:24:26.758]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:24:27.199 --> 01:24:29.961]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:35.077 --> 01:24:35.279]  Oh, yeah.
[01:24:44.659 --> 01:24:47.640]  I was talking about all over the country the Feds paid to have this done.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.840]  They, uh... Well, I had a news article the other day.
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:51.680]  I haven't covered it yet.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:57.581]  Bob, do you have that article where the little kid fell asleep at his table?
[01:24:58.341 --> 01:24:59.702]  His family had been in the hospital.
[01:24:59.802 --> 01:25:01.522]  It was his sister or his mother up in the article.
[01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:02.342]  This is admitted.
[01:25:02.362 --> 01:25:03.342]  I remember seeing this in the paper.
[01:25:03.862 --> 01:25:05.223]  So he fell asleep, his little head.
[01:25:05.243 --> 01:25:06.283]  They'd been at the hospital all night.
[01:25:06.303 --> 01:25:06.983]  He still went to school.
[01:25:07.523 --> 01:25:11.024]  And the officer came in, arrested him, charged him with disorderly conduct.
[01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:11.404]  Sleeping.
[01:25:11.684 --> 01:25:12.284]  Was disorderly.
[01:25:13.064 --> 01:25:15.826]  And now he's on probation and he visits the probation officer.
[01:25:16.506 --> 01:25:17.447]  And that's the new system.
[01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:19.629]  You know, 10 years in prison in Florida for speeding.
[01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:22.831]  You know, a year in prison for an apple peel.
[01:25:23.111 --> 01:25:25.372]  I mean, for an apple core or a banana peel on the ground.
[01:25:25.973 --> 01:25:30.876]  I mean, you know, it's total control where they're now arresting you for no seatbelt.
[01:25:30.896 --> 01:25:32.657]  They're now arresting you for no turn signal.
[01:25:33.438 --> 01:25:34.258]  They'll taser you.
[01:25:34.318 --> 01:25:38.461]  I mean, they taser you in Canada if you don't pay to get on the train.
[01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:40.903]  I mean, and they say this is your punishment.
[01:25:40.963 --> 01:25:42.484]  I mean, it's psycho.
[01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:43.885]  What's happened?
[01:25:45.045 --> 01:25:46.806]  We've lost our grand juries.
[01:25:47.707 --> 01:25:51.128]  There is a different way of appealing.
[01:25:51.789 --> 01:26:04.716]  When I was before the head district judge here in Travis County, and he suggested I file my complaints with the Sheriff's Department, I told him I did and they threw it in the trash, he said, well, I needed to appeal that to a higher court and petition for a writ of mandamus.
[01:26:04.756 --> 01:26:10.379]  And I told him, well, I don't know, judge, you know, you go before a corrupt judge and he renders a corrupt decision?
[01:26:10.979 --> 01:26:12.540]  So they tell you, oh, that's okay.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:16.582]  You can go before a whole panel of corrupt judges and they can screw your royal.
[01:26:17.262 --> 01:26:19.224]  He said, well, Mr. Kelton, I don't think it's that bad.
[01:26:19.244 --> 01:26:20.844]  Yeah, that's because you're not pro se.
[01:26:21.545 --> 01:26:23.626]  I would much rather appeal to a grand jury.
[01:26:24.787 --> 01:26:26.467]  He said, well, you can't appeal to a grand jury.
[01:26:26.507 --> 01:26:27.028]  Sure I can.
[01:26:27.924 --> 01:26:33.786]  I can appeal to them with allegations of shielding from prosecution against the officer and see if they can get him arrested.
[01:26:34.186 --> 01:26:36.847]  Much better to take your complaint to a grand jury.
[01:26:36.907 --> 01:26:49.372]  But I mean, how do they humanly, I guess it's all about revenue, a little kid who's an A student, falls asleep, 11 years old, and they arrest him and his life's basically criminal from now on.
[01:26:49.392 --> 01:26:50.432]  He'll never get out of their system.
[01:26:50.552 --> 01:26:52.653]  That's part of the basic programming.
[01:26:52.893 --> 01:26:55.274]  Oh, they admit the schools are to get you ready for prison.
[01:26:55.474 --> 01:27:01.455]  The biggest hurdle I have to come over is the programming you had in school.
[01:27:02.215 --> 01:27:13.097]  You go to school for twelve years and they tell you about all these great and wonderful rights that you have, and all these privileges that you have as a citizen, but don't even think of trying to express one of those while you're in this school!
[01:27:13.177 --> 01:27:16.858]  Because if you do, the whole weight of the world will fall right on your heads.
[01:27:16.958 --> 01:27:20.199]  But the schools are designed to hurt our children, and uh...
[01:27:20.979 --> 01:27:26.265]  Did you hear about the case with We Are Change in Kentucky, who had press passes and the cops tackled them and stole their stuff?
[01:27:26.706 --> 01:27:27.467]  No, I didn't hear about that.
[01:27:27.527 --> 01:27:31.512]  And then now they call the cops and the cops go, we don't have those officers working here, and it turns out they do.
[01:27:31.532 --> 01:27:33.915]  I mean, what do you do when they just deny it?
[01:27:33.935 --> 01:27:37.399]  And the cop would come walking out in his uniform and they'll laugh and say, doesn't exist, slave!
[01:27:37.739 --> 01:27:40.441]  Don't even go to... I don't even talk to the policemen.
[01:27:40.561 --> 01:27:42.703]  Once they've screwed up, I go up.
[01:27:43.243 --> 01:27:44.884]  First place I want to go is grand jury.
[01:27:45.645 --> 01:27:47.606]  And the prosecutor's going to say, well, you're going to file it with me.
[01:27:47.706 --> 01:27:48.607]  Okay, I'll file it with you.
[01:27:48.647 --> 01:27:50.869]  And then he'll refuse to give them to the grand jury.
[01:27:50.909 --> 01:27:52.110]  Then I'll file against both of them.
[01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:54.291]  You get up there in the higher areas.
[01:27:54.552 --> 01:27:55.332]  We're the sovereigns.
[01:27:55.392 --> 01:27:56.073]  We can do that.
[01:27:56.913 --> 01:27:58.334]  I mean, we're human beings.
[01:27:59.432 --> 01:28:00.353]  They forgot that.
[01:28:00.494 --> 01:28:02.076]  I thought they're authorities and we're scum.
[01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:04.819]  Well, I tend to remind them that I'm sovereign.
[01:28:05.139 --> 01:28:08.584]  I never tell them I'm sovereign, but I do things that sovereigns do.
[01:28:09.764 --> 01:28:11.604]  I don't care what they say about a grand jury.
[01:28:12.405 --> 01:28:19.606]  From what I can find in Texas, there's no law in Texas that says I cannot approach the foreman of the grand jury while he's sitting on the toilet.
[01:28:20.447 --> 01:28:22.647]  If it doesn't say I can't do it, I can do it.
[01:28:23.307 --> 01:28:29.229]  So I go to the highest courts, I go to the highest judges and the grand jury at the drop of a hat.
[01:28:30.236 --> 01:28:33.257]  Well, Randy, we're going to have to have you back up for two hours to take calls sometime.
[01:28:33.277 --> 01:28:33.937]  Very interesting fellow.
[01:28:34.217 --> 01:28:36.198]  I plan to get George Gordon back on the show, too.
[01:28:36.218 --> 01:28:40.719]  I haven't had him on in about five, six years as we explore other areas.
[01:28:40.779 --> 01:28:47.120]  But the website is jurisimprudence.com.
[01:28:47.821 --> 01:28:53.002]  And in the next month or so, we'll have another seminar here in Austin or any surrounding area.
[01:28:53.022 --> 01:28:55.623]  I'd like to have you back in the studio to plug that.
[01:28:55.683 --> 01:28:56.783]  Randy Kelton, thanks for the time.
[01:28:56.963 --> 01:28:59.924]  We also have a website, Rule of Law Radio.
[01:29:00.345 --> 01:29:01.465]  It's a little easier to remember.
[01:29:01.505 --> 01:29:02.906]  Ruleoflawradio.com.
[01:29:03.306 --> 01:29:05.007]  I'm sure my good friend, Danny, will appreciate that.
[01:29:05.327 --> 01:29:06.147]  Thank you for coming in.
[01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:06.727]  I appreciate it.
[01:29:07.328 --> 01:29:07.808]  Thank you, Randy.
