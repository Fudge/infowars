[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.269]  We're good.
[00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:32.529]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now already into the fourth and final hour of this worldwide broadcast against tyranny.
[00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:43.551]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, TruthNews.us, and you can also watch us live every day when we do this fourth hour.
[00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:48.432]  Sometimes we do the whole show, but always the fourth hour live video streaming at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:57.829]  Going back to Webster Tarbley, when we come back in the next segment, we will take your calls to the Balance of the Hour.
[00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:03.250]  Webster, finishing up with what you expect to see in this election.
[00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.310]  I know you think that the greater of two evils is Barack Obama.
[00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:18.372]  I myself see it as a huge distraction, but I understand you're saying his star appeal, and I agree, will bring people into the fold to support the corporate fascism and give them the grassroots cover they need.
[00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.933]  So I agree with you he's the most dangerous candidate.
[00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:32.136]  I just psychologically have divorced myself so much from the two parties, and fully understanding they're puppets that I can't even really see Obama, I guess as many other people see him.
[00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:36.837]  But in closing, in the three and a half minutes we have left in this opening segment, other key points you'd like to make?
[00:01:38.077 --> 00:01:49.300]  Well, I would say first of all, if you get Obama with the Democratic Congress, you will have the full fury of the fascist corporate state, in terms of that economic austerity,
[00:01:49.850 --> 00:02:08.119]  Killer austerity, genocidal austerity that I talked about, under green, polar bear, snail daughter auspices, third world solidarity, and possibly even this other question of reparations to that ethnic group, which would also be a very explosive recipe.
[00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.843]  If you get McCain, I would say you get a tired old lame duck, who is going to be a lame duck from the first moment he gets there.
[00:02:16.863 --> 00:02:17.904]  He'll be quacking in his
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.021]  In his inaugural address.
[00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:24.544]  And he will be faced by a very hostile Democratic Congress, giving us gridlock.
[00:02:24.584 --> 00:02:29.368]  This is the best outcome we could get under that scenario, would be the gridlock.
[00:02:29.408 --> 00:02:33.851]  So, in this sense, McCain is actually a lesser evil than Obama.
[00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:35.632]  The Democrats try to scare you with McCain.
[00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:38.495]  They tell you that he's going to put in these fascist judges.
[00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:42.117]  Well, the Democrats can filibuster those judges if they want to.
[00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:43.338]  So don't try to scare us with that.
[00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:47.201]  With Mrs. Clinton, I think you get a much more open-ended
[00:02:48.338 --> 00:03:04.189]  This is somebody who responds to public opinion through triangulation, but she does respond, and her history during the primaries has been to move more and more towards New Deal positions, at least verbally, and that's what we've got to work with at this point.
[00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:10.814]  And this would also allow a solution that would not be McCain and not be Obama.
[00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:17.499]  The merit of Mrs. Clinton is that she's not McCain and she's not Obama, and I think there is going to be a movement to try to
[00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.714]  Get her nominated and perhaps even to change the outcome of the convention.
[00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:26.696]  But I think the principle idea is you've got to build a movement.
[00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:33.982]  The way you build a movement is figure out what the financiers want most and oppose them.
[00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:36.604]  I would not say that the state is always the enemy.
[00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:38.085]  My analysis of history is different.
[00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:47.752]  I would say financier oligarchs, feudal aristocrats in the more distant past, financiers, finance oligarchs, bankers,
[00:03:48.497 --> 00:04:14.647]  are the enemy and if you look at the origin of the modern state under somebody like John Gagliazzo Visconti in Milan in the fourteen early about fourteen hundred uh... if you look at it louis the eleventh of france in the fourteen seventies fourteen eighties and henry the seventh of england the earl of richmond the guy who got rid of richard the third what you see there is an alliance of the king that is the state with the bourgeoisie the cities
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.625]  And the peasantry against what?
[00:04:16.946 --> 00:04:20.718]  Against feudal oligarchs who are already transforming themselves.
[00:04:21.184 --> 00:04:23.885]  Into banking oligarchs and financiers.
[00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:28.266]  Well, Webster, my point is that big states are the most abusive throughout history.
[00:04:28.886 --> 00:04:29.966]  It breeds corruption.
[00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:31.667]  The corrupt come in to suck out of it.
[00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:35.508]  And then look at what the oligarchs always want.
[00:04:35.548 --> 00:04:43.570]  They always want a big state as their tool to control populations, destroy middle classes, wage war on the bourgeoisie using the commie terms.
[00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.371]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley and your phone calls, right here on the one, the only,
[00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:50.772]  On September 11, 2001, along with
[00:05:01.826 --> 00:05:03.987]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:05.548]  And we knew what to do.
[00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:07.809]  And then look at what the oligarchs always want.
[00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:15.853]  They always want a big state as their tool to control populations, destroy middle classes, wage war on the bourgeoisie using the commie terms.
[00:05:16.634 --> 00:05:23.957]  We'll be right back with Webster Tarpley and your phone calls right here on the one, the only Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:25.278]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:30.837 --> 00:05:36.303]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:05:36.564 --> 00:05:37.865]  And we knew what to do.
[00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:39.667]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:05:39.887 --> 00:05:46.314]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:05:46.915 --> 00:05:52.101]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement.
[00:05:53.049 --> 00:05:55.450]  That the air was safe to breathe.
[00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.614]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:02.914 --> 00:06:05.956]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:11.318]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:11.858 --> 00:06:14.480]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.783]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:20.983 --> 00:06:22.824]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:23.887 --> 00:06:28.798]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:34.688]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.832]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:41.373]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:41.554 --> 00:06:45.036]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:06:56.665 --> 00:06:59.127]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:06.252]  No animal testing.
[00:07:06.532 --> 00:07:07.833]  I use them and love them.
[00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:09.454]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:10.815]  And I say big time.

[00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:33.750]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.095]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:44.060]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.204]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water.
[00:07:48.404 --> 00:07:52.187]  And it's de- That's 1-877-886-3653.

[00:07:59.432 --> 00:08:05.455]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:06.056 --> 00:08:09.098]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:25.447]  Okay, we've got Webster Tarpley with us for the rest of the hour, an in-depth interview today with him on the economy, the election,
[00:08:26.843 --> 00:08:29.885]  Almost happened in Russia in future actions.
[00:08:33.486 --> 00:08:43.111]  Before we go any further, Webster, is there anything else you want to add concerning the geopolitical climate we're in right now before we go to calls?
[00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:43.611]  Certainly.
[00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:52.196]  I think right now you've got to also look at the situation in Europe because one of Brzezinski's main goals, of course, is to play Europe against Russia, too.
[00:08:52.836 --> 00:08:56.358]  Normally, Europe would gravitate towards Russia right now because of the oil
[00:08:56.946 --> 00:09:05.912]  The natural gas, the epicenter of the current world economic breakdown crisis, the Bush economic depression, is of course London and New York.
[00:09:05.952 --> 00:09:12.117]  They've been hit hardest, and other people have been hit hard because they've gotten into bed with London and New York.
[00:09:12.157 --> 00:09:24.646]  There's a whole school of opinion in France, Germany, Italy, on the continent that it's time now to orient towards the Russians, East-West trade, oil for technology, mutually beneficial economic development.
[00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:26.347]  So Brzezinski's got to destroy that.
[00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:38.920]  And what he wants to use is that cordon sanitaire, or that unsanitary cordon of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Ukraine to begin cutting off the natural gas.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:52.465]  The Russians, of course, are going around that by building a pipeline down the middle of the Baltic so that they can deliver guaranteed energy without the Ukrainians and the Poles skimming or cutting it off or provoking or the rest of this stuff.
[00:09:52.972 --> 00:10:12.564]  Remember, we have to thank, ironically enough, in this terrible situation, we have to thank Sarkozy, of all people, and Merkel for blocking the attempt by Brzezinski to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO as members, or at least get that going, at the last NATO meeting back in April.
[00:10:12.604 --> 00:10:17.347]  Remember, Obama wants Georgia in NATO, the Washington Post want them in there.
[00:10:17.647 --> 00:10:20.989]  We've got to say no, no NATO membership for this bandit.
[00:10:21.608 --> 00:10:24.169]  Thug, kleptocrat regime.
[00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:30.731]  The other thing is, the Italian position right now, the Italian government is Berlusconi.
[00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.592]  This just shows you what kind of a situation we're in.
[00:10:34.072 --> 00:10:49.917]  Berlusconi, of course, is this dirty character that everybody knows, but he's also a friend of the Russians, and the Italians have gone very, very far in this East-West trade, oil for technology kind of stuff, and they've got a history of building
[00:10:50.325 --> 00:10:52.066]  You know, huge automobile plants, right?
[00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:56.168]  The Togliatti Fiat plant that built all those Ladas that are still running.
[00:10:57.468 --> 00:11:05.712]  The Italians are saying, the Foreign Minister Frattini is saying, we cannot transform the European Union into an anti-Russian bloc.
[00:11:06.172 --> 00:11:08.753]  So Georgia, get lost, stay out there.
[00:11:09.234 --> 00:11:14.776]  I've also been in touch with my friend Giulietto Chiesa, a member of the European Parliament in Brussels.
[00:11:14.816 --> 00:11:19.098]  You remember, he's the one who did the Zero documentary.
[00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.821]  I was in Milan last November.
[00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:31.766]  We had, oh, 500 people in an auditorium with Dario Fo, Nobel Prize for Literature and probably the most read playwright in the world today.
[00:11:31.826 --> 00:11:39.009]  There's an anthology also called Zero with essays by all sorts of people, among them yours truly.
[00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:47.434]  So Giulietto Chiesa is leading a publicity effort in Europe to try to show people that Georgia is this
[00:11:48.158 --> 00:11:49.479]  I don't know.
[00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:07.396]  In the middle of Berlin.
[00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:10.879]  Don't go with that, but rather dump Obama.
[00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:27.511]  I'm very glad to say my book, Obama the Postmodern Coup, is coming out in a German edition in the KOPP, which will be hitting the newsstands fairly soon, in time for the Frankfurt Book Fair, among other things.
[00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:30.834]  I'm also coming out in Japan, because there's another place.
[00:12:31.374 --> 00:12:32.195]  The Japanese
[00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:38.573]  ...have said very clearly, it was a successful summit of Prime Minister Fukuda with President Hu of China.
[00:12:38.893 --> 00:12:43.355]  The Japanese Defense Minister said, the biggest threat to us is chaos in China.
[00:12:43.635 --> 00:12:48.638]  This is a way of saying, dear Big New, we will not be a staging area for your attacks on China.
[00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:59.243]  In Taiwan, the KMT, the Kuomintang Party, has made a comeback, kicking out the US puppets, the DPP, Green Party, or Democratic Progressive Party.
[00:12:59.662 --> 00:13:07.969]  Get rid of them, put in people who are reasonable, who realize that their future is a rapprochement with China and mutually beneficial trade.
[00:13:08.109 --> 00:13:11.492]  Okay, well I'm sure I've got to stop you there because I want to give some time to callers.
[00:13:12.073 --> 00:13:14.995]  I have to say, everything you're saying is accurate about what's happening in the world.
[00:13:15.776 --> 00:13:18.799]  I don't disagree with about 95% of what you're saying.
[00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:22.102]  The problem is, there's more to all of this.
[00:13:23.143 --> 00:13:24.904]  It is a fact that the CIA
[00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:29.959]  Back the Communists against the Japanese in China.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:42.846]  It is a fact now declassified that the CIA, and David Rockefeller's written editorials in the New York Times saying this, wanted the Communist Chinese to come to power so that they could use them in China.
[00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:52.892]  It is a fact that Armand Hammer and the Rockefellers and the big foundation monies pumped billions into Russia from its founding, overthrowing the czars,
[00:13:54.102 --> 00:13:54.382]  I think
[00:14:12.196 --> 00:14:18.883]  Which leaves all nation states weak and vulnerable and basically starving and infighting with regional and religious conflicts.
[00:14:19.283 --> 00:14:23.607]  I just want to point out that we're not saying China's good or Russia's good or anybody's good here.
[00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:26.270]  You can disagree if you want.
[00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:34.538]  It's that you have this evil global corporate management system that was developed out of London, the city of London.
[00:14:37.423 --> 00:14:44.229]  I just don't want to oversimplify this where America and England and Israel are the bad guys and everybody else are the good guys.
[00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.852]  All these countries are engaging in oppression and corruption.
[00:14:48.153 --> 00:14:57.141]  That's the nature of society and I'm just trying to get people to see the bigger picture of how these big tectonic forces are colliding into each other.
[00:14:57.642 --> 00:15:05.168]  Well, let's look at the heart of the world problem right now is this mass of derivatives, this cancerous mass of kited derivatives.
[00:15:05.448 --> 00:15:10.512]  And that was a financial weapons system by the central banks while the dollar was still the world reserve currency.
[00:15:10.772 --> 00:15:20.240]  They made a mad dash to buy up all the real infrastructure of the world, buy up the defense contractors, media of the world, to set up their global corporate empire off of the yoke
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.542]  You know, like an egg off of the sustenance that was the United States.
[00:15:25.602 --> 00:15:47.190]  Now they want to leave us holding the financial bag for that collapse while they've moved into safe havens, then bring in a third world police state here and use the United States as a military enclave to produce modern Hessian soldiers for the new global corporate state that has shucked any connection to any original nation state.
[00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:55.373]  But remember now, if we use my estimate of 1 quadrillion, it's probably 1.5 quadrillion, or maybe a lot more.
[00:15:55.813 --> 00:15:57.774]  Well, it's 6,000 trillion that we know of.
[00:15:58.554 --> 00:16:03.556]  Well, yes, but I'm saying 1... Well, you want to say 2 quadrillion.
[00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:06.317]  Fine, 2 quadrillion is ballpark, perfectly good.
[00:16:06.897 --> 00:16:07.818]  Where is that centered?
[00:16:07.858 --> 00:16:11.199]  Well, about a quarter of that is just JPMorgan Chase.
[00:16:11.699 --> 00:16:13.480]  And when you add up the rest of the U.S.,
[00:16:14.045 --> 00:16:16.287]  You'll get up to well over half.
[00:16:16.327 --> 00:16:20.490]  You'll get up to probably two-thirds of the derivatives, and the rest are in London.
[00:16:20.991 --> 00:16:24.694]  So there you see where the center of this cancer is.
[00:16:24.774 --> 00:16:28.597]  To say that Russia is the same as this... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:28.697 --> 00:16:30.879]  I'm saying they're just not as powerful.
[00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:31.479]  Absolutely.
[00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:36.363]  The Anglo-American establishment flooded the world with this liquidity to get everybody in debt and get real assets.
[00:16:36.383 --> 00:16:37.865]  Now they're going to leave us holding the bag.
[00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:39.846]  So I don't, quote, see the U.S.
[00:16:39.906 --> 00:16:41.707]  now becoming a sub-player in all this.
[00:16:42.047 --> 00:16:43.508]  That was a foregone conclusion.
[00:16:44.009 --> 00:17:00.459]  I'm saying now the New World Order, the Anglo-American Empire, as you call it, is moving to that transcendent point where they sit above all the nation-states with their private intelligence networks in Russia, in China, in Israel, in the U.S., just playing us all off against each other.
[00:17:01.497 --> 00:17:03.499]  I don't believe that they have total world control.
[00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:04.059]  No, I don't.
[00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:05.881]  I think that there are real conflicts in the world.
[00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.362]  I don't think they have total world control.
[00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:09.303]  I'm saying they are dominant.
[00:17:10.745 --> 00:17:13.187]  Dominant up to a point, but fading fast.
[00:17:13.367 --> 00:17:19.452]  And Obama is really a flight forward, a desperate bid to give this a facelift, to give it a new lease on life.
[00:17:19.512 --> 00:17:23.435]  And if you block Obama, you're going to be dealing with a severely weakened imperialism.
[00:17:23.897 --> 00:17:27.980]  Under conditions of much greater difficulty in organizing mass protests.
[00:17:54.477 --> 00:17:59.921]  What is better for the American people, for the empire to crumble and fall apart, or for us to mindlessly support it?
[00:17:59.981 --> 00:18:08.187]  Obviously, I believe mindlessly supporting it, they will only rape us that much more financially and physically, and so it is good to let this fall apart.
[00:18:09.548 --> 00:18:18.714]  I would go with the populists, those prairie farmers back in 1890 meeting in Omaha, and they formulated the Populist Party program, which basically said,
[00:18:19.173 --> 00:18:27.038]  A mass movement needs to take over the government and turn it against Rockefeller, Morgan, and the Wall Street group, and I don't think that has changed.
[00:18:27.699 --> 00:18:28.780]  That's what we should be doing.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.782]  So he's a Golden Cross speech?
[00:18:32.962 --> 00:18:35.484]  Yes, although that's William Jennings Bryan.
[00:18:35.544 --> 00:18:38.646]  He's not really an organic representative of this.
[00:18:38.686 --> 00:18:45.291]  He is at least a politician who grew up in that milieu, and he's trying to fight Wall Street.
[00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:48.733]  Again, maybe he's not a good example, but if you want to think, who's like us?
[00:18:49.232 --> 00:18:53.560]  Who's isolated like we are, or relatively, with not that much money?
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.747]  Take those populists of 1890, and I think their strategy is valid.
[00:18:57.787 --> 00:19:00.492]  Now, you want to oppose the empire, you also want to construct
[00:19:01.736 --> 00:19:04.338]  An economic alternative to this, and for me this is clear.
[00:19:04.598 --> 00:19:07.460]  The New Deal methods worked then, they will work now.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.083]  Oh yeah, it's turned us into a bunch of dependents, broken down the family.
[00:19:11.103 --> 00:19:13.225]  The same foundations you talk about.
[00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:15.046]  But this is not the New Deal.
[00:19:15.126 --> 00:19:17.148]  The New Deal has been gone for 40 years.
[00:19:17.248 --> 00:19:22.432]  Hey Webster, a hundred years ago the big foundations, as you know, wrote how they were going to get us addicted to government.
[00:19:22.813 --> 00:19:23.613]  But see, you've got to...
[00:19:24.834 --> 00:19:29.376]  Look, I tell you, the populace in Omaha said, the government is going to belong to us.
[00:19:29.756 --> 00:19:31.616]  The goal is not get government out of your life.
[00:19:31.876 --> 00:19:33.357]  The goal is you take over the government.
[00:19:33.637 --> 00:19:39.759]  Now Milton Friedman, of course, from the Rockefeller Chicago School, says, government is always the problem.
[00:19:39.899 --> 00:19:40.679]  I don't buy that.
[00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:42.520]  Wall Street, finance oligarchs.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.521]  See, that's only one hand of the elite.
[00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:45.481]  That's only one hand.
[00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:51.483]  They claim they don't want government, but in truth they do want big government to suck off us with corporate welfare.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:55.452]  Again, I don't... I don't... Hold on, Webster.
[00:19:55.472 --> 00:19:56.472]  We're going to behind the scenes.
[00:19:56.512 --> 00:19:57.273]  I want to abbreviate this.
[00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:57.853]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.673 --> 00:19:59.053]  Go ahead now.
[00:19:59.073 --> 00:19:59.714]  We've got four minutes.
[00:20:01.094 --> 00:20:04.095]  I don't see that as the meaningful distinction.
[00:20:04.135 --> 00:20:08.977]  In other words, right now, you've got the question of foreclosures.
[00:20:09.377 --> 00:20:18.981]  If you leave this to the market, or if you leave it to the stuff we've got in place right now, we're going to have millions and millions of people thrown out of their homes, and we're going to have
[00:20:19.444 --> 00:20:22.181]  Millions and millions of domestic refugees and homeless.
[00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:22.945]  How do you stop that?
[00:20:23.294 --> 00:20:24.855]  You do it with a uniform federal law.
[00:20:25.115 --> 00:20:26.116]  No foreclosures.
[00:20:26.376 --> 00:20:27.497]  Foreclosures are over.
[00:20:27.797 --> 00:20:29.438]  You foreclose, you go to Leavenworth.
[00:20:29.758 --> 00:20:33.801]  On a home, on a farm, on a business, a taxi company, a trucking company.
[00:20:33.821 --> 00:20:38.083]  Well then people just stop paying completely and then things really implode.
[00:20:38.463 --> 00:20:40.785]  And then we owe interest on all that debt to the bankers.
[00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:42.326]  But no, we're going to wipe them out.
[00:20:42.346 --> 00:20:46.568]  In other words, what do you do with the quadrillion or two quadrillion of derivatives is you wipe them out.
[00:20:46.849 --> 00:20:47.769]  You can do it two ways.
[00:20:48.129 --> 00:20:52.292]  You can do it with a law that simply says derivatives are illegal because they are.
[00:20:52.998 --> 00:20:58.159]  As they were up until the early 1990s, or my method, tax them out of existence.
[00:20:58.199 --> 00:21:09.681]  Put a 1% Tobin tax or... And because they're blind shorting, naked shorting, and there's no real money behind it, they won't even belly up for a 1%?
[00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:18.842]  Well yeah, we're paying, you know, I don't know what the sales tax in Texas is, it's 5% in Maryland, and you don't pay it on groceries.
[00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:22.263]  In Virginia it's 5 to 7 and you pay it on groceries.
[00:21:22.853 --> 00:21:23.174]  I think so.
[00:21:38.556 --> 00:21:45.219]  You're up to about 1.2... Well, derivatives are predominantly global, and so the global government will have to implement that.
[00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:46.119]  But no, wait!
[00:21:46.259 --> 00:21:47.780]  There's no global government.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:59.305]  The United States government, using sovereign economic powers, can tax JPMorgan Chase and say, well, you have 500 million... Well, you said the Tobin tax, and that was introduced as a world tax.
[00:22:00.065 --> 00:22:03.987]  I have a better way to do it, which is to not just to tax foreign exchange transactions,
[00:22:04.437 --> 00:22:07.339]  But to tax all financial turnover.
[00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:09.000]  It would be a speculation tax.
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:15.023]  Right now, 40% of the price of oil, or 50%, is pure speculation.
[00:22:15.283 --> 00:22:16.164]  What are you going to do about that?
[00:22:16.484 --> 00:22:19.626]  If you want the market, that speculation will get even worse.
[00:22:19.926 --> 00:22:24.289]  Because even the regulatory regime we have, which is a joke, will be gone.
[00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:27.270]  They'll be gouging you without surcease.
[00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.072]  What you've got to do is to say, alright, you want to speculate, you're going to pay a 1%
[00:22:32.453 --> 00:22:39.161]  Well, you can also make it illegal to engage in all this leveraging where they don't even put money in.
[00:22:39.181 --> 00:22:40.743]  Well, here's an example, Webster.
[00:22:40.763 --> 00:22:42.706]  Look at government education and what it's done.
[00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:55.793]  Before we didn't have government education, we had the smartest, most educated people in the world.
[00:22:56.193 --> 00:22:59.616]  Now I hear people in stores talking about Russians attacking Georgia in the U.S.
[00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:01.917]  This is a political watershed that you've got to be aware of.
[00:23:02.418 --> 00:23:05.820]  In 1968, the New Deal came to an end.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.743]  And this was by the folly of Johnson, by the Vietnam War, and all the rest.
[00:23:11.084 --> 00:23:15.427]  What we've had for 40 years after that is the rule of the reactionary Republicans.
[00:23:15.447 --> 00:23:17.208]  It's the social engineering is what we've had.
[00:23:17.228 --> 00:23:17.888]  We've had the eugenicist
[00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.632]  Carrying this out while the bleeding-heart liberals run around saying, help the poor people.
[00:23:23.692 --> 00:23:27.115]  This is all relevant, but the thing you've got to focus on is production.
[00:23:28.743 --> 00:23:34.747]  I'm telling you this, any government system you come up with, no matter how well-meaning, will be hijacked by the oligarchs, and it always is.
[00:23:34.887 --> 00:23:37.629]  Well then, it sounds like we live in a hopelessly fallen world.
[00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:49.777]  No, if we remove a lot of the taxation mechanisms against us, I'm all for taxing them, but you notice we'll never get that, then... It has been done in the past, and the New Deal was essentially that, and it can be done again.
[00:23:49.877 --> 00:23:51.999]  Okay, we're coming back to the main transmission right now.
[00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:54.280]  I want to come in with intro music, folks.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.281]  I want to take phone calls.
[00:23:55.301 --> 00:23:56.582]  We're talking to Webster Tarpley.
[00:23:56.602 --> 00:23:56.862]  Here we go.
[00:24:04.867 --> 00:24:10.031]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[00:24:10.451 --> 00:24:15.475]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[00:24:15.956 --> 00:24:20.559]  I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.983]  But somehow they just don't end up as mine.
[00:24:26.813 --> 00:24:29.616]  It's a death-defying life I lead.
[00:24:30.397 --> 00:24:31.918]  I take my chances.
[00:24:32.439 --> 00:24:36.062]  I'd die for a living in the movies and TV.
[00:24:37.804 --> 00:24:48.054]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:49.015]  I might
[00:24:50.888 --> 00:24:56.606]  He is the author of Obama, the Postmodernist Coup, available at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:56.626 --> 00:24:57.830]  Your phone calls right now.
[00:24:59.406 --> 00:25:13.939]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide as we blast out on AM and FM dial across the country, global shortwave at WWCR, the internet at Infowars.com, and of course with now more than 60,000 people a day pulling our free podcast.
[00:25:14.339 --> 00:25:22.506]  If you haven't done it, check it out, listen how you want, when you want, where you want, and of course number one on Shoutcast, number one on the internet for radio listeners.
[00:25:23.227 --> 00:25:25.129]  Webster Tarpley continuing
[00:25:26.129 --> 00:25:29.531]  With your analysis, let's get the take of the callers.
[00:25:29.952 --> 00:25:32.533]  Steve, in Chicago, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:25:33.254 --> 00:25:37.076]  Well, first of all, I want to say I'm talking to two fine men.
[00:25:37.817 --> 00:25:43.440]  Secondly, I think that you guys have been turned around backwards on this situation with Russia.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:52.906]  You didn't even report that last month, it was July 25th, that Putin had threatened the United States with stationing atomic bombers in Cuba.
[00:25:54.551 --> 00:25:56.733]  Look, Putin has been warning the U.S.
[00:25:57.233 --> 00:26:03.740]  loyally all through 2007 at that Munich Werkunde meeting in the springtime.
[00:26:04.361 --> 00:26:07.324]  He talked about this neocon striving for U.S.
[00:26:07.344 --> 00:26:07.845]  Stop, stop, Tarbly.
[00:26:07.865 --> 00:26:09.026]  I'm going to let you get to it in a minute.
[00:26:09.266 --> 00:26:12.250]  Because this is, Steve, you can't listen to four hours every day.
[00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:12.950]  I don't believe it.
[00:26:13.451 --> 00:26:14.792]  I have been saying for the last
[00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:18.942]  However many months since this was said, I talk about that every week.
[00:26:19.002 --> 00:26:38.297]  I talk about their foreign minister saying, if you keep moving weapon systems and troops and training and destabilizing in Poland and in Czech Republic and in Georgia and in Ukraine and in all these areas and in the stands and moving your military in, we're going to start moving nukes near you.
[00:26:38.457 --> 00:26:40.179]  And I have said that on record.
[00:26:40.959 --> 00:26:41.460]  So go ahead.
[00:26:42.085 --> 00:26:44.747]  Okay, so you're reporting your point of view.
[00:26:45.087 --> 00:26:52.833]  You don't ever mention the people in Eastern and Central Europe talking about a domino theory where the situation is dialectic.
[00:26:53.174 --> 00:26:56.376]  In other words, Russia... Sir, Russia, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.
[00:26:56.436 --> 00:26:58.738]  Russia is shrinking, not getting bigger.
[00:26:59.018 --> 00:27:02.141]  It wasn't Russia that snuck attacked a U.S.
[00:27:02.181 --> 00:27:03.722]  military base last Thursday night.
[00:27:03.742 --> 00:27:06.184]  It was the United States, which isn't our government anymore.
[00:27:06.644 --> 00:27:07.704]  I'm just stating facts.
[00:27:08.265 --> 00:27:11.806]  I can't stand communists or leftism or any of this stuff.
[00:27:12.286 --> 00:27:15.047]  I'm here trying to give you a real geopolitical view into this.
[00:27:15.347 --> 00:27:27.592]  Did Georgia not blow the hell out of an entire city and massacre a bunch of Russian troops and peacekeepers out of a clear blue sky where they've been since 1991 in a ceasefire in two areas that have always been part of Russia?
[00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:29.073]  Ossetia?
[00:27:30.914 --> 00:27:31.274]  Go ahead.
[00:27:32.334 --> 00:27:32.754]  Wait a minute.
[00:27:33.014 --> 00:27:34.115]  If what you say were true,
[00:27:34.508 --> 00:27:41.671]  The first thing they would have done was blow that tunnel between Ossetia and North Ossetia.
[00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:42.672]  The Rokhi Tunnel.
[00:27:42.932 --> 00:27:44.813]  You can only get tanks or trucks in there.
[00:27:44.853 --> 00:27:47.014]  Hold on, what are you saying I'm lying about?
[00:27:47.474 --> 00:27:51.295]  Well, what I'm saying is... I mean, Georgia admits they snuck attack Russia.
[00:27:51.435 --> 00:27:52.096]  I doubt that.
[00:27:52.376 --> 00:27:55.397]  There were... Hold on a minute, I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:27:55.777 --> 00:27:56.818]  This is too insane.
[00:27:58.389 --> 00:28:02.612]  Okay, I mean, Georgia, Tarbley, what do you say to something like this?
[00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:03.752]  Well, this is the U.S.
[00:28:03.792 --> 00:28:12.399]  media line, this is CNN, this is what Bush says, this is what Zalmay Khalilzad says at the United Nations, what McCain says and what Obama says, and it's a big lie.
[00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:14.000]  It's a Goebbels big lie.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.222]  The aggressor is Georgia.
[00:28:16.402 --> 00:28:17.923]  You have whatever the status quo was.
[00:28:18.331 --> 00:28:23.495]  The Russian peacekeepers were there under a signed agreement with the Georgian government from 15 years ago.
[00:28:23.596 --> 00:28:32.243]  And let me add, the Georgians had already been taking pot shots at the Russian troops and citizens, beating people up, killing them in the outlying towns around Ossetia.
[00:28:32.523 --> 00:28:34.385]  Ethnic cleansing, that's why the Russians had to come in in 1992-93.
[00:28:34.465 --> 00:28:42.211]  And then let me expand, they shut the water off to Ossetia a month ago and already had them under siege.
[00:28:43.072 --> 00:28:47.096]  And they basically had a campaign of bombings and assassinations building up to this.
[00:28:47.136 --> 00:28:50.639]  So it's a cynical, orchestrated plan by Georgia.
[00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:53.562]  Now, the Russians see it coming, and they say, fine, you want to attack?
[00:28:53.602 --> 00:28:54.642]  We'll be ready for you.
[00:28:55.063 --> 00:28:57.645]  And the minute they attack, they took the bridge and the tunnels.
[00:28:57.685 --> 00:29:08.435]  But look, Steve, I don't think... I would also add, ultimately, beyond all the details, you want to have your children incinerated in a thermonuclear fireball for the sake of that bandit, that little Hitler, Saakashvili?
[00:29:08.655 --> 00:29:09.296]  That's crazy.
[00:29:09.861 --> 00:29:10.962]  Look, I'm going to come back to you, Steve.
[00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:13.544]  We're going to skip this break, too, for InfoWars.com listeners.
[00:29:13.564 --> 00:29:14.585]  Got to go to those streams, folks.
[00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:18.448]  But, I mean, this is completely... Steve, I'm blown away here.
[00:29:18.768 --> 00:29:22.911]  You think I'd go on air and lie to you about Georgia attacking Russia?
[00:29:24.152 --> 00:29:26.494]  I mean, what are you talking about?
[00:29:26.514 --> 00:29:28.175]  I mean, are you serious, Steve?
[00:29:29.936 --> 00:29:30.777]  Bring Steve back up.
[00:29:31.698 --> 00:29:32.018]  He's there.
[00:29:32.578 --> 00:29:33.179]  Steve, are you there?
[00:29:35.077 --> 00:29:37.619]  All right, we're going to take a break and see if we can get Steve Ray's back up on the phone.
[00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.681]  Steve, it's just incredible.
[00:29:39.981 --> 00:29:44.786]  I mean, all I do is report the facts here, and I'm living in la-la land.
[00:29:45.066 --> 00:29:46.247]  More of your calls right now.
[00:29:46.327 --> 00:29:46.748]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.469 --> 00:29:52.373]  Webster, this is just getting too crazy when people are in total denial.
[00:29:52.733 --> 00:29:54.455]  Are you still there, Steve, or did you hang up?
[00:29:56.522 --> 00:29:58.964]  I guess Steve finally dropped off.
[00:29:58.984 --> 00:30:03.087]  Steve, you can call back at 1-800-259-9231 if you can get back in.
[00:30:03.648 --> 00:30:05.970]  Webster, that is just flabbergasting.
[00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:13.576]  All the media at the footnotes, if you'll just read the bottom of the articles, admit Georgia ran a sneak attack, and he's saying we're making stuff up?
[00:30:14.076 --> 00:30:18.620]  Robert Kagan, the neocon Robert Kagan in the Washington Post yesterday says,
[00:30:19.051 --> 00:30:21.755]  We're not interested in the details of how this started.
[00:30:21.775 --> 00:30:24.638]  In other words, the massacre of 2,000 people in the middle of the night.
[00:30:24.898 --> 00:30:26.000]  Forget those details.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.482]  Let's look at the big picture.
[00:30:28.831 --> 00:30:33.795]  Well, the Russians had to move in there, or it would have set a precedent for them to start leveraging into Russia proper.
[00:30:34.255 --> 00:30:38.599]  Imagine, this is direct killing of Russian soldiers.
[00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:50.508]  Attacking police bases, military bases, blowing the daylights out of them, midnight sneak attack, admitted, then CNN shows the Georgian missile launchers firing and says they're Russian, that's now come out.
[00:30:50.768 --> 00:30:55.892]  I mean, they treat the public like they're complete idiots, and I guess some of them really want to be lied to.
[00:30:56.752 --> 00:31:01.995]  This is the same media that brought you 9-11, and the Iraq War, and Obama, and now they're trying to bring you this.
[00:31:02.635 --> 00:31:06.376]  And also the ones two years ago when the Israelis invaded Lebanon.
[00:31:06.396 --> 00:31:08.858]  We were supposed to sympathize with the Israelis.
[00:31:08.918 --> 00:31:10.898]  Yeah, they called that a Lebanese attack.
[00:31:11.379 --> 00:31:11.599]  Right.
[00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:12.599]  Same thing.
[00:31:12.659 --> 00:31:14.320]  Hezbollah is really bad, yeah.
[00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:20.055]  Alright, so this is, it's just a fraud, and the first Gulf War, and now the second Gulf War.
[00:31:20.075 --> 00:31:28.578]  Oh listen, listen, I had a news guy at the local radio station do a show at Syndicated on Sundays, kind of argue with me, and he was going, you're saying Georgia attacked?
[00:31:29.038 --> 00:31:31.339]  And I'm just going, you know what, I can't deal with this anymore.
[00:31:31.359 --> 00:31:32.439]  I mean, I just...
[00:31:34.179 --> 00:31:38.081]  It is also the question of the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia.
[00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:44.924]  I know the media said the Serbs attacked, when for years we had this Al-Qaeda being funded attacking.
[00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:53.427]  Yeah, you have the KLA or UCK, which is this terrorist, gun-running, drug-running, slave-running organization.
[00:31:53.447 --> 00:31:54.768]  You're supposed to sympathize with them.
[00:31:55.228 --> 00:31:57.649]  Anyway... Let's take another call.
[00:31:57.869 --> 00:31:59.169]  Rico in Toronto.
[00:31:59.189 --> 00:31:59.770]  You're on the air.
[00:32:02.111 --> 00:32:02.871]  Come on ahead, Rico.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.521]  Okay, yeah, thanks.
[00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:09.204]  I was going to say, it seems the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[00:32:10.705 --> 00:32:15.088]  Like, take for example the illegal alien situation.
[00:32:15.829 --> 00:32:29.419]  In the late 60s, early 70s, all these radical groups were always funded and controlled by big foundations, big money.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:41.265]  And they were actually encouraged to have problems, to create problems, should I say, so that basically the police would come, the state would come.
[00:32:41.305 --> 00:32:42.465]  Yeah, so they can balkanize.
[00:32:42.505 --> 00:32:43.766]  Same thing with the Black Panthers.
[00:32:44.086 --> 00:32:45.387]  They go in and radicalize.
[00:32:45.447 --> 00:32:45.887]  Stay there, Rico.
[00:32:45.907 --> 00:32:47.387]  We're coming back on the main broadcast.
[00:32:47.648 --> 00:32:48.468]  I want to get Webster's tarp.
[00:32:48.488 --> 00:32:54.490]  We take on that, and I'll give you a counterpoint or another statement or question after that with Rico in Toronto, then Elliot, Jeff, Cliff, and others.
[00:32:54.511 --> 00:32:57.332]  We've got to move quick with calls, though, because I want to get a lot of your questions in.
[00:32:57.372 --> 00:32:57.692]  Here we go.
[00:33:03.522 --> 00:33:09.546]  Okay, we were just talking to Rico on the Infowars.com behind-the-scenes streams.
[00:33:09.566 --> 00:33:13.569]  You go to Infowars.com, those specific exclusive streams of the behind-the-scenes.
[00:33:14.709 --> 00:33:16.731]  We are talking to Rico in Toronto.
[00:33:16.991 --> 00:33:27.418]  He brought up how the big foundations fund La Raza, Mecha, the radical black separatist groups, all of this to get us all fighting with each other and so then they can radicalize peaceful groups
[00:33:28.118 --> 00:33:31.402]  So those groups never get true equality or freedom or economic mobility.
[00:33:31.782 --> 00:33:34.986]  They get neutralized, bitter, and filled with hate.
[00:33:35.046 --> 00:33:35.947]  More balkanization.
[00:33:36.007 --> 00:33:37.188]  Webster Tarpley.
[00:33:37.568 --> 00:33:40.572]  This is an absolutely critical theme, and you're absolutely right.
[00:33:40.872 --> 00:33:45.277]  If you look, first of all, at Obama, he is more than anything else a product of the foundations.
[00:33:45.337 --> 00:33:47.980]  His mother was an operative for the Ford Foundation.
[00:33:48.507 --> 00:34:00.955]  Obama has worked for the Gamaliel Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, Gun Control, the Woods Fund, the Annenberg Foundation, playing black parents against the black teachers' union.
[00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:05.257]  His friend Bernardine Dorn gets huge money from the MacArthur Foundation.
[00:34:05.737 --> 00:34:16.264]  My research for my next book, which is Barack H. Obama, the Unauthorized Biography, reveals that the Weathermen were actually founded with a Ford Foundation grant.
[00:34:16.744 --> 00:34:18.025]  Certainly, Floyd McKissick
[00:34:18.539 --> 00:34:28.881]  Stokely Carmichael, the worst firebrands, Rap Brown, these characters, the people who opposed Martin Luther King with their incendiary rhetoric, all foundation-funded.
[00:34:29.162 --> 00:34:39.324]  And as you correctly point out, the worst provocateurs of the Hispanic community, the people who talk this insanity about carving up the United States, they're also foundation-funded.
[00:34:39.664 --> 00:34:44.245]  Obama has friends like Khalidi and a bunch of others.
[00:34:44.745 --> 00:34:47.906]  This is a foundation-funded, pro-US wing,
[00:34:48.405 --> 00:34:50.327]  of the PLO, among the Native Americans.
[00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:54.830]  You got a guy like Ward Churchill, who is essentially in the same corner.
[00:34:55.411 --> 00:35:02.417]  The pervasive activity of these foundations is one of the things that's destroying American society.
[00:35:02.557 --> 00:35:07.401]  Obama is somebody who says he was a community organizer for the Gamaliel Foundation.
[00:35:07.681 --> 00:35:15.627]  What he's really saying is, I was a poverty pimp for the foundation world, where the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation dominate.
[00:35:15.908 --> 00:35:16.268]  This is
[00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.111]  One of the principal things about Obama, this is what he comes from.
[00:35:20.411 --> 00:35:30.134]  His world, that stuff about the bitter clingers, the people who cling to religion and guns, and anti-trade, that is the foundation, trilateral point of view.
[00:35:30.454 --> 00:35:33.555]  You cannot have a president who hates the American people.
[00:35:33.855 --> 00:35:38.276]  In the case of Obama, he does hate the American people, and therefore he's going to attack
[00:35:38.789 --> 00:35:41.371]  This austerity program, with great gusto.
[00:35:41.632 --> 00:36:06.393]  Unlike Carter, who probably had some Christian scruples about it, Obama will have nothing of the sort, because he's been worshipping in a Ford Foundation church, that Reverend Jeremiah Wright, with Dwight Hopkins as an operative of the Ford Foundation, Reverend Otis Moss got through college with the Ford Foundation, this whole James Cone, black liberation theology, is again, the Ford Foundation Union Theological Seminary School of this stuff.
[00:36:06.849 --> 00:36:10.050]  And it is designed to perpetuate racial conflict.
[00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:25.634]  Absolutely, and they fund all these groups, they do it to get everybody at each other's throats, and then the racial tension becomes real, and then it's a dynamo which just builds up force and strength.
[00:36:25.674 --> 00:36:26.674]  Anything else, Rico?
[00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:36.177]  My second point, something you had brought up a couple weeks ago when you were talking about the anthrax letter that the Bush enemy received.
[00:36:36.724 --> 00:36:37.024]  Yes.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:45.047]  I remember reading quickly, the Roman Empire, and it was the same thing.
[00:36:45.067 --> 00:36:46.488]  It was the same thing.
[00:36:46.648 --> 00:36:54.551]  Cicero, a little bit before Caesar came into power, Cicero was saying how the enemies of Rome need to be dealt with.
[00:36:54.791 --> 00:36:55.872]  I've received letters.
[00:36:55.892 --> 00:37:01.334]  I have letters that say that a couple senators are going to be mass assassinated, so we need to clamp down.
[00:37:01.954 --> 00:37:04.115]  This worked a thousand years ago.
[00:37:04.135 --> 00:37:05.055]  It works again.
[00:37:05.075 --> 00:37:06.136]  It's the same thing.
[00:37:07.194 --> 00:37:07.775]  Nothing's changed.
[00:37:18.783 --> 00:37:48.223]  And it's pretty accurate, actually, but you just look at every country, and just the thousands of revolutions, and all the subterfuge, and backstabbing, and Machiavellian activity, and elites, and cloak and dagger, and then somehow they taught the American people the last hundred years that none of that exists, everything's fine, go back to sleep, and if we say anything on this show, it's just start looking around you, and realizing that when these elites get out of control, and these warlords, and these banker warlords start fighting with each other, the oligarchy as Webster calls them,
[00:37:49.103 --> 00:37:55.070]  Uh, when these moneyed, uh, you know, noble interests, uh, start battling with each other, we don't matter in the equation.
[00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.231]  We get hurt real bad.
[00:37:57.032 --> 00:37:59.294]  And, uh, this is just a game of chess for them.
[00:37:59.314 --> 00:38:01.497]  I mean, people say, well, why do they want more power?
[00:38:01.677 --> 00:38:02.518]  They're already so rich.
[00:38:02.578 --> 00:38:04.920]  Only body who knows rich people knows they want even more.
[00:38:05.441 --> 00:38:10.402]  They want power, they want control, and to deny that there are people that want power and control is to deny history.
[00:38:10.742 --> 00:38:28.365]  Webster, I want to go to calls quickly, but how did we get to the point, do you think, of the average person, they're now coming out of this delusion and this mesmerized smokescreen, but people to say, oh there's no subterfuge, there's no corruption, there's no influence, there's no behind the scenes, you're a crazy dangerous conspiracy theorist.
[00:38:28.745 --> 00:38:31.506]  How were they able to inculcate that in people's minds?
[00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:33.947]  Well, it's a long process of degradation.
[00:38:34.007 --> 00:38:51.558]  I think that the central question is probably the deindustrialization of the United States initiated by Volcker, under trilateral Carter and Brzezinski auspices, and then continued with the union busting of the Reagan years, the systematic decline in the standard of living.
[00:38:51.598 --> 00:38:54.280]  So it's about minus two-thirds of what it had been
[00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.450]  Uh, around 1966.
[00:38:56.651 --> 00:39:05.234]  And so people are having to work twice as hard just to keep the illusion going, and so they physically are just disconnected, saying, I don't care.
[00:39:05.254 --> 00:39:11.117]  There's also the, more recently, Obama could not have broken through if the Democratic Party had not been in chaos.
[00:39:11.778 --> 00:39:13.419]  And part of that is Pelosi.
[00:39:13.799 --> 00:39:20.124]  Pelosi came in with the mandate of stopping the Iraq War, and she brought the... And instead she's ruled with an iron fist, saying no.
[00:39:20.664 --> 00:39:28.830]  And what we then had is, as soon as that was in power, then Al Gore comes out of the woodwork with his demagogic, fake, global warming campaign.
[00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:39.150]  To break the momentum against Bush and against the Iraq War, and then by the end of that year you've got Obama deployed into a chaotic Democratic Party.
[00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:49.175]  Let me stop you, because I want to go to Elliot, Jeff, Cliff, and others, and DJ, but before we do that, I wanted to last hour get into the eugenics angle, which you're a real expert on, Webster.
[00:39:49.195 --> 00:39:50.275]  I mean, I know my stuff on this.
[00:39:50.295 --> 00:39:54.717]  I've read over 20 books on the subject and studied it, and you know even more in some cases than I do.
[00:39:55.137 --> 00:39:56.078]  In a nutshell,
[00:39:57.481 --> 00:39:59.082]  Why do they want to reduce our numbers?
[00:39:59.202 --> 00:40:00.562]  Why do they want to enslave us?
[00:40:00.662 --> 00:40:03.123]  Why do they want to bring feudalism back in?
[00:40:03.163 --> 00:40:06.484]  Is this just the instincts of the Anglo-American feudal lords?
[00:40:07.484 --> 00:40:11.125]  And, I mean, break that down, what the fake modern environmentalism is.
[00:40:12.806 --> 00:40:15.266]  Well, one is the population side.
[00:40:15.567 --> 00:40:19.268]  The oligarchy always argues that there are two main problems in the world.
[00:40:19.448 --> 00:40:23.569]  One is overpopulation, the other is industrial pollution in some form.
[00:40:24.398 --> 00:40:30.620]  To be an oligarch means that you've got to hate the majority of humanity by thinking that you're better off than they were.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:38.242]  You can go back to the works of Hesiod in ancient Greece, pretty much the beginning of the, you know, sort of archaic Greek literature.
[00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.002]  Plato as well.
[00:40:39.602 --> 00:40:43.283]  The reason for the Trojan War was that there were too many people.
[00:40:43.743 --> 00:40:50.625]  Too many people were oppressing the breast of Mother Earth, and therefore we had to have the Trojan War to kill off a lot of them.
[00:40:51.078 --> 00:40:55.964]  In terms of the global warming, I don't need a climatologist to say that this is a fraud.
[00:40:56.485 --> 00:41:00.390]  As a historian, I can look back to the medieval warm period, 1100-1200.
[00:41:02.253 --> 00:41:12.799]  When you have grapes growing in England, grapes growing in... What about Iberia Maxim 8,000 years ago, which brought us into the Bronze Age, and the first city-states?
[00:41:13.119 --> 00:41:15.380]  I mean, it was 10 degrees hotter on average then.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.361]  They have the high scores, there's no doubting it.
[00:41:17.461 --> 00:41:22.224]  We are well within the band of fluctuation of historical memory.
[00:41:22.584 --> 00:41:31.729]  The other one, of course, is we have a little Ice Age, around 1600 to 1625, which corresponds to the Spera Minimum and the Maunder Minimum,
[00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:36.332]  In the sunspot cycle, it is basically determined by solar activity.
[00:41:36.372 --> 00:41:40.274]  That's at least a major input, not by human activity at all.
[00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:47.138]  And in that Little Ice Age, you had the ports of Northern Europe, the ports of Germany and the Netherlands frozen with ice, icebergs.
[00:41:47.619 --> 00:41:53.622]  So the idea of being a climatologist means you're a charlatan and a fraud, because it's a discipline.
[00:41:54.082 --> 00:41:55.403]  It's not meteorology.
[00:41:55.523 --> 00:41:56.824]  It's not oceanography.
[00:41:56.984 --> 00:41:58.585]  It's not any science.
[00:41:58.625 --> 00:41:59.325]  It's not history.
[00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:06.917]  It's a fake science invented by Al Gore, and all during the Clinton years, if you didn't agree with Al Gore, you would be fired.
[00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:09.420]  Now come on, he claims he invented the internet too.
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:18.709]  He certainly is the pimp pusher of it, but the Club of Rome in the early 60s said they would use threat of a fake Ice Age or global warming to bring in global taxes.
[00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:22.974]  And remember, Aurelio Pache, the co-founder, was an old fascist.
[00:42:23.573 --> 00:42:28.857]  And the other one was Alexander King, who once admitted that the purpose of this was genocide in the third world.
[00:42:28.897 --> 00:42:33.901]  He said, you know, the reason we preach this, after all, is to block development of the third world.
[00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:35.102]  That is still the same.
[00:42:35.202 --> 00:42:41.087]  And that's in the British Commission on Population, 44 to 49, which was rolled into State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:42:42.047 --> 00:42:53.336]  Yes, and beyond the 200, remember that this was all institutionalized under Carter, under Muskie, as Global 2000 and Global Futures, under Brzezinski, Trilateral, Rockefeller,
[00:42:54.051 --> 00:43:01.912]  So you basically got Kissinger as a puppet of Nelson Rockefeller, Brzezinski as a puppet of David Rockefeller, and that's pretty much the way the thing is run.
[00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:04.533]  Continue, flush that out.
[00:43:05.313 --> 00:43:11.094]  Well, then, you know, the idea of having a world population reduction, i.e.
[00:43:11.474 --> 00:43:14.435]  military genocide, built into the U.S.
[00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:19.376]  foreign policy is this Global 2000, Global Futures, and then what do they do?
[00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:21.476]  They turn around and implement that by supporting
[00:43:21.909 --> 00:43:24.091]  Paul Pott, who goes very far, right?
[00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:27.093]  He's the champion in terms of proportional genocide.
[00:43:27.153 --> 00:43:31.657]  I think he manages to kill 30 to 40 percent of the Cambodian population.
[00:43:32.217 --> 00:43:38.002]  And Khomeini, who aborts the entire industrialization process of Iran.
[00:43:38.302 --> 00:43:44.327]  What they're trying to show is that third world populations can be organized against themselves to destroy themselves.
[00:43:44.607 --> 00:43:46.128]  And ultimately that's what Obama is.
[00:43:46.188 --> 00:43:50.812]  A fascist mass movement is the organization of a population against itself
[00:43:51.355 --> 00:43:52.436]  Let's go to Elliot in Ohio.
[00:43:52.476 --> 00:43:53.597]  You're on the air.
[00:43:53.617 --> 00:43:54.618]  No, I'm afraid I haven't.
[00:43:54.658 --> 00:43:55.058]  Go ahead.
[00:44:11.952 --> 00:44:14.634]  I was on Jordan Maxwell's site and I went to one of his links.
[00:44:15.754 --> 00:44:26.660]  In 1983, these two guys, research expert David Dodge and former Baltimore police investigator Tom Dunn, they were in the Belfast Library on the coast of Maine.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.281]  They found a constitution from 1825
[00:44:31.776 --> 00:44:36.319]  And, uh, there was actually a missing, there's a missing 13th Amendment in our Constitution.
[00:44:36.399 --> 00:44:38.901]  It was ratified in 1819 and has not been repealed.
[00:44:40.642 --> 00:44:44.704]  There were more than 30 original broadsheets made and quite a few of them are still around.
[00:44:44.784 --> 00:44:47.546]  I've heard of, well, go ahead.
[00:44:48.707 --> 00:44:51.268]  Well, I mean, like, it's titles of nobility and honor.
[00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:57.292]  It says, if any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honor,
[00:45:01.113 --> 00:45:05.254]  Yes, speak of the devil.
[00:45:05.335 --> 00:45:14.179]  John, I sent you that clip from C-SPAN of former Secretary of State Colin Powell telling the reporter that he's a knight commander, order of the bath.
[00:45:14.199 --> 00:45:15.139]  Will you cue that up, please?
[00:45:15.419 --> 00:45:15.859]  I sure will.
[00:45:15.959 --> 00:45:16.260]  Thank you.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.020]  Go ahead, Elliot.
[00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:25.884]  Yeah, retain any present pension officer or emolument of any kind, whatever, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power
[00:45:26.434 --> 00:45:29.235]  Such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States.
[00:45:29.275 --> 00:45:41.762]  Yes, I'm saying you can't be a foreign agent, basically, which makes sense, and I have a... If I may, I have a question about... Now, I know what you're talking about, and it does exist, and I wrote about this in 1996 in Executive Intelligence Review.
[00:45:41.802 --> 00:45:43.002]  You might find it on the Internet.
[00:45:43.342 --> 00:45:44.643]  It's an article that says U.S.
[00:45:44.703 --> 00:45:50.766]  Constitution bars Powell from the presidency because he had become this British nobleman.
[00:45:50.786 --> 00:45:51.987]  Yeah, we do know of it.
[00:45:52.207 --> 00:45:52.867]  The U.S.
[00:45:52.907 --> 00:45:54.408]  Constitution right now says
[00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:58.533]  You cannot hold an office of profit and trust under the United States.
[00:45:58.553 --> 00:46:03.658]  In other words, you can't be in the executive branch or the Supreme Court if you accept the title of nobility.
[00:46:03.698 --> 00:46:08.663]  And that plays into the Logan Act as a... as in the code blocking that.
[00:46:09.003 --> 00:46:10.304]  But this one goes further.
[00:46:10.344 --> 00:46:13.547]  It says, if you accept such a title of nobility, you cease to be a citizen.
[00:46:13.567 --> 00:46:14.488]  Yes, it's currently in there.
[00:46:14.508 --> 00:46:15.109]  That's what I had known.
[00:46:15.129 --> 00:46:17.091]  I was ready to attack Rudy.
[00:46:17.271 --> 00:46:20.574]  Sir Rudy Giuliani would have been coming under attack from me.
[00:46:21.247 --> 00:46:24.590]  On this, if he had gotten the Republican... Yes, Elliot, that is legitimate.
[00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:25.491]  You refresh our memory.
[00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:25.811]  Thank you.
[00:46:25.871 --> 00:46:29.515]  And speaking of Powell and the nobility, here is the audio clip right now.
[00:46:31.396 --> 00:46:37.021]  Knight Commander of the Order of the Bat.
[00:46:37.061 --> 00:46:42.887]  Her Majesty gave it to Almond to me about 12 years ago.
[00:46:42.907 --> 00:46:43.687]  Knight Commander.
[00:46:43.707 --> 00:46:45.189]  Listen carefully.
[00:46:45.209 --> 00:46:46.830]  Knight Commander of the Order of the Bat.
[00:46:51.492 --> 00:46:54.293]  We have the video clip up on Infowars.com.
[00:46:54.313 --> 00:46:54.934]  We put it up there.
[00:46:55.274 --> 00:47:03.277]  When Queen Elizabeth II was here in town last year surveying her lands, they had a White House function.
[00:47:03.297 --> 00:47:12.640]  They were announcing who they were, and much of the administration coming in were being announced by their British titles and giving fealty to the Queenie.
[00:47:13.361 --> 00:47:15.261]  So I hope that answers your question, Elliot.
[00:47:15.281 --> 00:47:16.602]  Let's go to Cliff in Virginia.
[00:47:17.622 --> 00:47:18.822]  Cliff, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:47:22.163 --> 00:47:22.623]  Hello?
[00:47:22.643 --> 00:47:23.624]  Yes, Cliff, go ahead.
[00:47:24.744 --> 00:47:25.784]  Yeah, how you doing today?
[00:47:26.644 --> 00:47:28.145]  Enjoying your show, by the way, also.
[00:47:29.445 --> 00:47:46.609]  My question is this, Mr. Tarpley, is I read a report several months ago here where China sent word to Illuminati operatives that if they tried to indeed, you know, make any type of move toward China, and it's, shall I say, their friends, which will be Russia and
[00:47:47.133 --> 00:47:47.594]  I don't
[00:48:07.233 --> 00:48:13.135]  Any aggression made toward China and the people around the Illuminati would be assassinated.
[00:48:14.856 --> 00:48:15.976]  I mean, there's two questions there.
[00:48:15.996 --> 00:48:31.802]  What do you think of Benjamin Fulford, the former Forbes writer who meets with Rockefeller on video and says he's been told by the Asian elite, the mafia, that they know about the population reduction plan and the bioweapon attack plan that Cheney talks about in the PNAC documents, September 2000, Rebuilding America's Defenses.
[00:48:32.803 --> 00:48:34.124]  So, A, what do you think of that?
[00:48:34.504 --> 00:48:41.789]  And then B, kind of a recap of what does this do now that this didn't go well in Georgia?
[00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.571]  Let me do it the other way.
[00:48:43.731 --> 00:48:48.354]  I don't use this concept of Illuminati because I think this is just pure confusion.
[00:48:48.755 --> 00:48:54.759]  The notion that a society founded in Bavaria runs the world, in my view, is just absurd.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:49:00.804]  What you're dealing with is the city of London, British, and Wall Street, the U.S.
[00:49:01.252 --> 00:49:02.653]  That's the operative unit.
[00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:08.857]  And these terms like New World Order and Illuminati, I think they contribute to confusion rather than clarity.
[00:49:08.877 --> 00:49:12.559]  Even though all these presidents use them and hail it and swear sovereignty.
[00:49:12.579 --> 00:49:15.881]  Yeah, look, the origin of this Illuminati, though, is British intelligence.
[00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:16.361]  I know.
[00:49:16.381 --> 00:49:19.903]  They're here to say, oh, we're not the main enemy in the world.
[00:49:19.943 --> 00:49:21.964]  Those Bavarians are the main enemy.
[00:49:22.004 --> 00:49:22.905]  This is just crazy.
[00:49:22.925 --> 00:49:24.546]  All right, let me break this down for you, Webster.
[00:49:25.106 --> 00:49:27.108]  There is an element to all of this.
[00:49:27.168 --> 00:49:29.149]  The elites are obsessed with the occult.
[00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:38.376]  The British system, let me finish, please, is masonic, and they really are into this, and they really do govern a lot of what they do according to it.
[00:49:38.516 --> 00:49:47.763]  Sure, but now you're talking to Scottish Rite Freemasons of London and, you know, God knows other institutions, that they have the Club of the Isles and all sorts of other things.
[00:49:48.204 --> 00:49:51.086]  But again, this Bavarian thing, this is the crazy part.
[00:49:51.468 --> 00:49:53.890]  This is what the British themselves put out to say.
[00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:55.191]  Well, that was just one agent.
[00:49:55.251 --> 00:49:57.473]  That was Weisopp and the guy who got struck by lightning.
[00:49:58.194 --> 00:49:59.655]  Thank you so much.
[00:49:59.695 --> 00:50:01.016]  Wait, let's do the Fulford part.
[00:50:01.356 --> 00:50:04.759]  There is a history of secret societies in China.
[00:50:04.779 --> 00:50:16.049]  For example, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, when he wanted to do the Chinese Revolution in 1911, turned to something called the Red Door Society, the Hongmen Society.
[00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:17.070]  However,
[00:50:17.808 --> 00:50:22.570]  I think this stuff now is, you have to look at this with tremendous skepticism, and here's why.
[00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:32.013]  Suppose we have the Turkmen Islamic Party setting off some stunt in Beijing now for the Olympics.
[00:50:32.873 --> 00:50:43.057]  If that's terrorism, either Mexico City 68 or Munich 72 style, you're going to have a wave of international sympathy with China.
[00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:50.091]  Suppose now the Anglo-Americans have come up with a dialectical or two-phase false... Hold on!
[00:50:50.131 --> 00:50:55.732]  We're going to do three minutes behind the scenes exclusively at the InfoWars.com streams and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:50:55.772 --> 00:50:56.193]  Stay with us.
[00:50:57.653 --> 00:50:58.853]  Okay, you got three minutes, Webster.
[00:50:58.873 --> 00:51:03.475]  Go over this, then we're going to come back and finish up with Jeff and DJ and Matt.
[00:51:03.515 --> 00:51:03.875]  Go ahead.
[00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:11.797]  If you get the US and the British using this Turkmenistan, the tip, the Turkmenistan Islamic Party,
[00:51:12.173 --> 00:51:22.255]  And Commander Sayfula that we've seen, pulling a stunt in Beijing, with wet work, with the bodies, then you're going to get international sympathy with China.
[00:51:22.296 --> 00:51:28.677]  Now suppose, in a second phase of a false flag, to magnify the world effect.
[00:51:28.717 --> 00:51:37.899]  It's like going from 9-11 to anthrax, which is something, you know, 9-11 is for people in big cities only, high-rises, but anthrax is for anybody who gets the mail every day.
[00:51:37.959 --> 00:51:40.520]  In other words, everybody in the world, practically,
[00:51:41.178 --> 00:51:43.098]  You can imagine a second phase.
[00:51:43.118 --> 00:51:46.259]  Now suppose the US and the British strike in Beijing.
[00:51:46.899 --> 00:51:56.362]  And then they say, um, the Chinese secret societies have given a press conference and they come forward and say, that's it.
[00:51:56.722 --> 00:51:57.342]  We've had it.
[00:51:57.802 --> 00:52:00.123]  You Anglo-Americans, we've had it up to here.
[00:52:00.483 --> 00:52:01.423]  We're striking back.
[00:52:01.743 --> 00:52:03.103]  We're going to bring down the internet.
[00:52:03.363 --> 00:52:05.924]  We're going to destroy world financial transactions.
[00:52:06.314 --> 00:52:13.675]  We're going to paralyze the world through the internet with logic bombs, denial of service, cyber warfare, and so forth.
[00:52:14.096 --> 00:52:21.357]  This would then begin to turn world hatred and resentment against China in a very, very strong way.
[00:52:21.457 --> 00:52:27.238]  So, I think if anybody believes that there are omnipotent Chinese secret societies, I don't think they are.
[00:52:27.838 --> 00:52:34.620]  And everybody knew about the Anglo-Americans being genocidal, you know, going back to this Kissinger Memorandum of 1974 or
[00:52:36.644 --> 00:52:38.065]  Or the Carter administration.
[00:52:38.405 --> 00:52:43.968]  Now, John D. Rockefeller III has been very, in his lifetime, very adamant about this stuff.
[00:52:44.368 --> 00:52:50.292]  So I don't think it makes any particular sense that there is this war of the secret societies.
[00:52:50.352 --> 00:53:00.017]  I think this is the kind of a story that I would approach with the greatest care and skepticism, because it lends itself to this kind of a false flag scenario.
[00:53:00.057 --> 00:53:01.458]  It's a way to popularize that.
[00:53:03.595 --> 00:53:27.770]  We know that Japan and China under the feudal system was run by secret hereditary societies, and they are dominant in many areas of life today, and so I think to pooh-pooh the reality of it is wrong, but also to give it omnipotence, as you said, I think is to overplay something that is not... Remember, suppose if you had some group saying, you know, we're the new Red Door Society, and we're destroying the Internet,
[00:53:28.194 --> 00:53:28.875]  Then the U.S.
[00:53:28.935 --> 00:53:30.696]  could say, all right, that's it.
[00:53:30.776 --> 00:53:38.822]  Yeah, that's another shadowy Goldstein type of wraith on which all of these other things can be hung like a scarecrow.
[00:53:39.103 --> 00:53:41.064]  Right, and it could be like Sarajevo.
[00:53:41.104 --> 00:53:44.027]  In other words, the Austrians say to Serbia, give us those criminals.
[00:53:44.347 --> 00:53:44.767]  The U.S.
[00:53:44.807 --> 00:53:51.092]  could say, okay, China, deliver us the 100 top members of the Red Door Society, and we're going to take care of them.
[00:53:51.112 --> 00:53:52.333]  The Chinese have to say no.
[00:53:52.373 --> 00:53:54.475]  We're going to come in with a final segment right now.
[00:53:54.495 --> 00:53:55.255]  I understand, Webster.
[00:53:55.276 --> 00:53:55.596]  Here we go.
[00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:06.390]  All right, final segment in worldwide transmission.
[00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.591]  Retransmission starts in T-minus six minutes at one place.
[00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:11.132]  Infowars.com.
[00:54:11.232 --> 00:54:13.513]  That's where you can always listen to the show.
[00:54:13.533 --> 00:54:14.773]  It'll already broadcast 20 hours.
[00:54:14.793 --> 00:54:16.114]  We'll be back live tomorrow.
[00:54:16.914 --> 00:54:18.975]  Before we jam in, a few final calls from Webster Tarbley.
[00:54:18.995 --> 00:54:20.395]  I want to tell you about a fine sponsor.
[00:54:20.775 --> 00:54:24.257]  A Cola Blue Atmosphere Water Generator.
[00:54:25.247 --> 00:54:25.427]  I think?
[00:54:40.771 --> 00:54:46.434]  Around three gallons, at least two and a half gallons, even in the worst deserts, with the lowest humidity.
[00:54:46.474 --> 00:54:47.455]  Just an amazing system.
[00:54:47.495 --> 00:54:48.816]  Great tasting pure H2O.
[00:54:49.256 --> 00:54:51.117]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[00:54:51.437 --> 00:54:53.058]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[00:54:53.679 --> 00:54:55.040]  Natural pH.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:58.242]  Give them a call.
[00:54:58.262 --> 00:54:58.522]  1-866-585-4044.

[00:55:06.346 --> 00:55:07.387]  866-585-4044.
[00:55:07.827 --> 00:55:11.769]  Okay, let's jam in quickly here.
[00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:13.370]  Let's jam in.
[00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:15.931]  Jeff in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[00:55:15.951 --> 00:55:18.112]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[00:55:18.472 --> 00:55:20.133]  First time caller, but long time listener.
[00:55:20.173 --> 00:55:22.234]  I'll be brief since I know you're short on time.
[00:55:23.975 --> 00:55:26.716]  This does relate to what you've been talking about.
[00:55:26.836 --> 00:55:28.457]  I read a link this morning.
[00:55:28.757 --> 00:55:30.458]  It was from the Financial Times of London.
[00:55:30.498 --> 00:55:32.039]  It was written by Peter Garnham.
[00:55:32.853 --> 00:55:44.143]  And in it, it's just a couple sentences long, Ulrich Leutmann at Commerzbank said in a note that he expected the dollar to rise, quote, like a phoenix, quote unquote.
[00:55:44.683 --> 00:55:50.688]  And he also said that in a very short period of time, quote unquote, sentiment turned by 180 degrees.
[00:55:50.748 --> 00:55:52.470]  The market now believes that the U.S.
[00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:53.631]  economy once again
[00:55:54.212 --> 00:55:56.773]  We'll be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly.
[00:55:56.793 --> 00:55:58.574]  But they've said this three times in the last year.
[00:55:58.614 --> 00:56:01.596]  It always goes up and then further down the next time.
[00:56:01.736 --> 00:56:03.777]  I hope it goes up and they can artificially do it.
[00:56:04.017 --> 00:56:08.019]  But all the real market fundamentals show the dollar has been devalued.
[00:56:08.059 --> 00:56:08.939]  They keep printing it.
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:14.342]  You have this debt, liquidity, hundreds of millions a month being pumped into financial institutions.
[00:56:14.962 --> 00:56:16.183]  Webster, what do you see happening?
[00:56:16.523 --> 00:56:20.665]  The main thing you have is a violent contraction of employment and production.
[00:56:20.925 --> 00:56:22.026]  Detroit is collapsing.
[00:56:22.506 --> 00:56:24.147]  The big three automakers are collapsing.
[00:56:24.187 --> 00:56:25.908]  Their subcontractors are collapsing.
[00:56:26.708 --> 00:56:31.750]  Generally speaking, manufacturing employment in this country is really on its last legs.
[00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:45.176]  So this contraction, which is expressed in growing unemployment and growing unreported unemployment, those who have given up in despair, we'd have to look at things like freight car loadings and truck loadings.
[00:56:45.356 --> 00:56:47.997]  Real, tangible, physical, economic indices.
[00:56:48.382 --> 00:56:52.465]  And you will see that this economy is approaching the point of thermodynamic breakdowns.
[00:56:52.525 --> 00:56:54.226]  And they're telling us everything's wonderful.
[00:56:54.886 --> 00:56:57.127]  But after that, the financial panic will happen.
[00:56:57.468 --> 00:56:58.448]  They put these stories out.
[00:56:58.488 --> 00:57:04.232]  The Plunge Protection Team, of course, as everybody knows, props them up with the help of Helicopter Ben Bernanke.
[00:57:04.272 --> 00:57:14.198]  They've now got the entire Wall Street, be it JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Goldman, and Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley, and Merrill, and UBS.
[00:57:14.718 --> 00:57:15.999]  All of them are on life support.
[00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:17.960]  They're all getting huge injections
[00:57:18.422 --> 00:57:26.787]  of Federal Reserve liquidity, and the question is, you know, how long before that becomes generalized hyperinflation on the German 1923 model.
[00:57:26.807 --> 00:57:27.768]  Yeah, we're out of time.
[00:57:27.808 --> 00:57:28.488]  We're out of time.
[00:57:28.809 --> 00:57:29.389]  We're out of time.
[00:57:29.489 --> 00:57:30.750]  Sorry to DJ and Matt.
[00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:31.310]  Call back tomorrow.
[00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:32.931]  I'll put you up first, or next time.
[00:57:32.971 --> 00:57:33.592]  Tarpley's on.
[00:57:33.912 --> 00:57:35.493]  Webster, thank you for spending time with us.
[00:57:35.533 --> 00:57:40.056]  His book is Obama, You Bet the Postmodern Coup, available at Infowars.com.
[00:57:40.096 --> 00:57:40.756]  Take care, Webster.
[00:57:41.096 --> 00:57:41.457]  Bye-bye.
[00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:45.851]  An amazing two-hour, 45-minute interview with Webster Tarbley.
[00:57:45.991 --> 00:57:49.312]  I want to tell you that the new film, Fabled Enemies, I just came out with Truth Rising.
[00:57:49.352 --> 00:57:50.853]  Well, we're accelerating our info war.
[00:57:51.393 --> 00:57:53.374]  Burmese's new film, made right here, I produced it.
[00:57:53.714 --> 00:57:57.295]  Fabled Enemies, you can start pre-ordering that Thursday or Friday.
[00:57:57.315 --> 00:57:58.475]  It'll be up on the shopping cart.
[00:57:58.495 --> 00:57:59.616]  You get the DVD first.
[00:57:59.636 --> 00:58:01.356]  It ships out September 1st.
[00:58:01.416 --> 00:58:02.677]  Wink, wink, maybe a little bit early.
[00:58:02.937 --> 00:58:05.558]  It'll be on PrisonPlanet.tv September 1st.
[00:58:05.618 --> 00:58:06.178]  Well, guess what?
[00:58:07.298 --> 00:58:14.841]  You can watch the first trailer for Fabled Enemies, Berman's new film, up at the top right-hand corner of PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:58:16.342 --> 00:58:26.866]  I'm going to announce tomorrow who the winner of the first contest is, another on the 19th, a bigger one, for the InfoWarsPrisonPlanet.com contest.
[00:58:27.366 --> 00:58:33.409]  Listen, huge show today, Paul Kirk Roberts the first of the show, martial law news in the U.S., out of Arkansas.
