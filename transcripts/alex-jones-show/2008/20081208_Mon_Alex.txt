[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.230]  Hmm?
[00:00:00.512 --> 00:00:01.256]  Learn to be a right...
[00:00:02.122 --> 00:00:07.964]  Okay, we are now live at PrisonPlanet.tv here in the last hour and 12 minutes or so of the show.
[00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:09.585]  She's with us for the next 45 or so.
[00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:20.149]  Got her on a bit late because I wanted to finish up with the history of the riflemen in this country and trying to re-educate the public that they've been brainwashed against the Second Amendment.
[00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.289]  So that's what we're doing here.
[00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.871]  Betty Martini hasn't been on the show in years, but I've interviewed her many times.
[00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:30.433]  Another example, another solution of someone single-mindedly taking action.
[00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:58.135]  In the last few decades, she has woken up millions of people, been on international TV, radio, thousands of times, international TV, scores of times, with her website about aspartame, the doctors, the scientists, the research she's brought together, just handing out hundreds of thousands of pamphlets about aspartame, known as NutraSweet or Equal, just how deadly it is, all the scientific evidence, the brain tumors, the excitotoxin, the endocrine disruptor,
[00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:00.196]  To where a lot of governments have banned it.
[00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.496]  A lot of countries now put warning labels that the U.S.
[00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:03.116]  doesn't yet.
[00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:10.259]  But now they are putting it in thousands and thousands of products and not even listing it as aspartame.
[00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:17.901]  You can't buy at any major store bubble gum or chewing gum that doesn't have it, even when it's not artificial.
[00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:21.563]  Even when it says regular sugar, not sugar-free, they're adding aspartame.
[00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:22.643]  How is that happening?
[00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:23.423]  Why is that happening?
[00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:25.664]  Betty, it's great to have you back on with us.
[00:01:26.317 --> 00:01:30.545]  It certainly has been a long time, Alex, but I'm so glad to talk to you again.
[00:01:30.565 --> 00:01:39.101]  I remember how we started out many, many years ago, and there really is a lot going on about aspartame today in the world.
[00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:40.583]  Okay, we're going to break in a moment.
[00:01:40.603 --> 00:01:43.445]  I'm going to give you the floor for the 40-50 minutes we've got with you today.
[00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:46.986]  We're going to be back up with Dr. Blaylock soon because I haven't really covered this in years.
[00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:52.988]  I'm going to get back into it with all the melamine news and the plastic toxins news and the lead in the toys news.
[00:01:53.388 --> 00:01:55.309]  That is all dwarfed by the aspartame.
[00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.330]  And so, just recap how you got involved in this.
[00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.010]  We're going to come back.
[00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.151]  What is aspartame?
[00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:03.312]  A brief snapshot of its history and where we currently are.
[00:02:07.512 --> 00:02:10.474]  Betty, so go ahead and tell us a little bit about yourself for folks that don't know you.
[00:02:11.194 --> 00:02:11.635]  Okay.
[00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:17.818]  First of all, I'm the founder of Mission Possible International, which is a global volunteer force.
[00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:19.319]  I work with world experts.
[00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:27.424]  We have operations today in 30-down nations, everybody working free to warn the world about aspartame.
[00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:30.166]  That started out many years ago.
[00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:33.828]  I think I've been doing this now close to 17 years.
[00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:35.429]  Never thought it would take this long.
[00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:43.715]  When someone almost died from aspartame after being diagnosed with Parkinson's, when I met Dr. H.J.
[00:02:43.775 --> 00:02:56.023]  Roberts, who explained aspartame not only can precipitate Parkinson's, but interacts with L-DOPA, and he was probably drinking a Diet Coke with his L-DOPA, which is exactly what he was doing.
[00:02:56.524 --> 00:03:05.810]  And after reading his first book and finding out about the MS issue and seizures that would get people off of aspartame and their seizures would stop,
[00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:12.520]  The MS people would walk out of wheelchairs, and today there's even been a movie made about it.
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.622]  All right, Betty, stay there.
[00:03:13.802 --> 00:03:14.242]  Stay there.
[00:03:14.543 --> 00:03:15.204]  Got you on late.
[00:03:15.224 --> 00:03:16.105]  We apologize for that.
[00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.647]  You'll have plenty of time to break this down.
[00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:20.191]  A wonderful hero in the fight for health.
[00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:20.892]  Betty Martini.
[00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:21.313]  Stay with us.
[00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.613]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:03:25.774 --> 00:03:29.858]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:38.006]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water
[00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:38.706]  We're good to go!
[00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:15.635]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:17.276]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:32.617]  But who is the enemy?
[00:04:33.077 --> 00:04:33.638]  Bin Laden.
[00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:34.879]  This is his MO.
[00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.200]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.881]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:45.007]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:04:45.407 --> 00:04:45.847]  Some U.S.
[00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:51.572]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:04:52.232 --> 00:04:55.713]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:58.714]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:37.584]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods, in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration, and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash, Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:44.946]  Between now and January 20th, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[00:05:45.426 --> 00:05:46.967]  That's a 33% savings.
[00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:50.548]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[00:05:50.988 --> 00:06:00.231]  Ready Reserve Food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, allowing a 15 plus year shelf life.
[00:06:00.691 --> 00:06:06.413]  Ready Reserve has been manufacturing since 1972, giving them the freedom to offer you amazing savings.
[00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.047]  I read the news today, oh boy
[00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:45.301]  Gold is up by $19.90 today.
[00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.362]  $7.74, 20 cents.
[00:06:47.543 --> 00:06:55.330]  All right, going back to Betty Martini, founder of Worldwide Volunteer Force.
[00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.894]  30 plus countries, gotten nations to ban it, take it out of the food and drinks.
[00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:00.835]  Not here, though.
[00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:03.584]  Okay, Betty, you've got the floor.
[00:07:03.624 --> 00:07:11.167]  Roll through the basics of what it is, the studies, the fight, where it currently is being used and put into thousands of foods today.
[00:07:12.047 --> 00:07:20.550]  Okay, first of all, as I was saying, there's now a movie about it called Sweet Misery of Poison World, and I can remember when Corey Brackett called me.
[00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.391]  She was in a wheelchair.
[00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:25.872]  She had gained a great deal of weight.
[00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:26.692]  She couldn't walk.
[00:07:27.232 --> 00:07:28.333]  She could barely talk.
[00:07:28.413 --> 00:07:31.114]  She was diagnosed with one of the largest lesions
[00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:37.339]  Ever diagnosed in an aspartame victim, and she said she had walked out of her wheelchair.
[00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.079]  She was fine.
[00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:39.920]  She said, a movie needs to be made about it.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.080]  I said, tell me about it.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.461]  She said, honey, I own the film company.
[00:07:44.442 --> 00:07:50.405]  And she went ahead to make Sweet Misery, that you can get it found in fury.tv.
[00:07:50.925 --> 00:07:59.829]  And in it, it tells how this deadly, addictive, excitoneurotoxic, carcinogenic drug that interacts with virtually all drugs and
[00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:02.201]  The vaccine got on the market.
[00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:12.329]  And what happened was, Surr was the original manufacturer, and they couldn't take a poison and make it safe, so they got caught.
[00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.833]  And the FDA asked U.S.
[00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:23.879]  Prosecutor Sam Skinner to indict them for fraud, and instead he went to work for Sidley and Austin,
[00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:26.184]  Which is their defense team.
[00:08:26.264 --> 00:08:30.907]  So they asked prosecutor William Conlon to indict him and he too went to work for them.
[00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:36.650]  So the FDA still would not approve it and revoked the petition in 1980.
[00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:44.014]  And you'll find the actual 50-page report on www.mpwhi.com.
[00:08:44.495 --> 00:08:52.019]  Now the interesting thing here, it almost sounds like a story out of Twilight Zone, is that Searle had hired Don Rumsfeld
[00:08:52.674 --> 00:08:55.075]  As CEO of Searle to clean up this mess.
[00:08:55.995 --> 00:09:02.357]  And Don Rumsfeld said he would call in his markers and get aspartame on the market no matter.
[00:09:02.997 --> 00:09:16.341]  So the day after they revoked the petition, which would have been signed into law in 30 days, Searle sued the FDA to keep it from being signed.
[00:09:17.121 --> 00:09:20.702]  Rumsfeld was on President Reagan's transition team.
[00:09:21.463 --> 00:09:28.965]  And he owed Rumsfeld a favor, because he had promised to nominate him for Vice President and instead nominated Bush.
[00:09:29.626 --> 00:09:30.826]  So here's what he did.
[00:09:31.866 --> 00:09:45.591]  He had the transition team, someone from them, to call the FDA Commissioner, Jerry Goyan, at 3 in the morning and fire him, because he was going to sign it into law.
[00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:49.192]  And we have the letter from his wife on the website.
[00:09:49.867 --> 00:10:02.549]  Then he appointed Dr. Arthur Hull Hayes to do the deadly deed, but he knew that it would take 30 days to get him to the FDA, and that would be too late.
[00:10:03.089 --> 00:10:10.171]  So he wrote an executive order making the FDA powerless to do anything about aspartame until he got there.
[00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:17.892]  When he got there, he overruled the Board of Inquiry, got aspartame on the market, and then went to work
[00:10:18.393 --> 00:10:24.118]  But the PR agency of the manufacturer for $1,000 a day on a 10-year contract.
[00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:28.602]  So he sold his soul for $365 million.
[00:10:29.202 --> 00:10:34.527]  And now today, aspartame disease has become a global plague.
[00:10:35.187 --> 00:10:40.211]  And a medical text by Dr. Roberts has been written that's over 1,000 pages of the horrors
[00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:46.173]  Neurodegenerative diseases and cancers that it causes.
[00:10:46.393 --> 00:10:47.233]  Betty, we've got a break.
[00:10:47.253 --> 00:10:50.335]  When we come back, there's thousands of studies as you know.
[00:10:50.815 --> 00:10:54.037]  Get into what they did with the monkeys covering it up, that it killed the monkeys in the test.
[00:10:54.077 --> 00:10:55.077]  Rumsfeld covering it up.
[00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:58.719]  How many foods and drinks it's actually in and how we stop it.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.200]  Back in 70 seconds.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.760]  Stay with us.
[00:11:04.462 --> 00:11:05.983]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:11:12.378 --> 00:11:14.059]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:17.781]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:11:17.962 --> 00:11:19.883]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:23.145]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:11:23.445 --> 00:11:28.928]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:33.111]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:11.852]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:12:15.054 --> 00:12:16.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:12:17.455 --> 00:12:20.217]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12:27.296 --> 00:12:30.378]  All right, we're back live, moving quick, with Betty Martini.
[00:12:30.398 --> 00:12:32.739]  She'll give you her website and some of the other good sites to go to.
[00:12:33.239 --> 00:12:34.580]  It's all documented.
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.862]  Government documents, government studies, letters, reports.
[00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:40.503]  Everything she says is documented and triplicate.
[00:12:40.983 --> 00:12:42.284]  She's an amazing researcher.
[00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:46.206]  When she started out 17 years ago fighting this, nobody was talking about it.
[00:12:46.647 --> 00:12:55.031]  And she really single-handedly started, ignited the fire that's now got it banned, restricted in nations, and saved undoubtedly tens of millions of people.
[00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:56.192]  It's got to feel good.
[00:12:56.792 --> 00:13:01.478]  And it's another example of what good people can do when they take action against evil.
[00:13:02.219 --> 00:13:04.662]  Who are the other Betty Martinis out there on other issues?
[00:13:04.822 --> 00:13:09.808]  The Second Amendment, open borders, GMO crops, fighting the New World Order.
[00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:11.870]  Where are the other Alex Joneses out there?
[00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.874]  Look at all I've been able to do, thanks to you spreading the word.
[00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:17.340]  Alright, Betty Martini.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.841]  Again, these are some short segments here at the end of the hour.
[00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:20.782]  Long segment coming up.
[00:13:20.802 --> 00:13:21.963]  We're going to break in about five minutes.
[00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:25.965]  Please continue rolling with what aspartame is.
[00:13:26.365 --> 00:13:33.209]  You gave us some of the history of how it got in, and then now that it's lost its patent, it's been put in tens of thousands of things that we know of.
[00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:36.311]  Okay, and I'm glad you brought up the monkey study.
[00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:40.673]  First of all, aspartame is 40% aspartic acid.
[00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:48.306]  And which is an excitotoxin and stimulates the neurons of the brain to death, causing brain damage.
[00:13:48.346 --> 00:13:52.788]  And Dr. Russell Blaylock wrote the book, Excitotoxins, The Taste That Kills.
[00:13:53.368 --> 00:14:06.335]  Then it has a methyl ester, which immediately becomes free methyl alcohol, which is a severe metabolic poison, converts to formaldehyde, causes metabolic acidosis.
[00:14:06.675 --> 00:14:09.076]  There's 50% phenylalanine, which is an isolate,
[00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:23.341]  ...is a neurotoxin, floods the brain, lowers the seizure threshold, depletes serotonin, and causes psychiatric and behavioral problems, and then interacts with all antidepressants.
[00:14:23.842 --> 00:14:31.604]  The whole molecule breaks down to diketokyprosine, which is a brain tumor agent, which triggered brain tumors in original studies.
[00:14:32.024 --> 00:14:38.166]  So everything about the molecule is poison, and it's genetically engineered.
[00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:39.106]  All of it.
[00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:49.495]  Now, the monkey study that you're referring to, there's a little more on this now, was actually pivotal in the approval of aspartame.
[00:14:49.635 --> 00:14:55.298]  It was a 52-week oral toxicity study done on seven infant monkeys fed aspartame.
[00:14:55.998 --> 00:15:03.542]  Five had grand mal seizures, one died, and they actually used that in the approval of aspartame.
[00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:08.984]  Now, something about that is, as it explains in Dr. Roberts' medical text,
[00:15:09.793 --> 00:15:17.896]  Is that it interacts with all anti-seizure medication, sometimes even after the patient is off of aspartame.
[00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:27.999]  But what is going on now is that they are beginning to put aspartame in the very products used to treat the problems that it causes.
[00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:38.782]  For instance, an informant from Pfizer called and said they had reformulated Dilantin and had put aspartame in it.
[00:15:39.398 --> 00:15:46.046]  And indeed, people are complaining of more seizures and many reactions that aspartame causes.
[00:15:46.973 --> 00:15:50.195]  Such as male sexual dysfunction and all the vision changes.
[00:15:50.395 --> 00:15:52.537]  I mean it's an accelerant, but we're about to break.
[00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:55.578]  Let's go back and then we'll come back and get into the monkey study and what you're covering now.
[00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:57.419]  And it's not just Betty Martini saying this.
[00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:04.804]  All the medical doctors and brain surgeons and toxicologists you've got on your team and it's all documented on your website.
[00:16:04.824 --> 00:16:05.364]  We'll give that out.
[00:16:05.384 --> 00:16:12.648]  But going back, yeah, tell them how they make aspartame when you mentioned that it's, you know, biologically engineered.
[00:16:12.688 --> 00:16:13.389]  Explain that to them.
[00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.510]  Well,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:41.117]  It's interesting that Dr. Bill Deagle worked across from the aspartame factory, and he had seen all these vats of this black toxic sludge, and he said that they were told at the hospital not to mention the things that it was causing.
[00:16:41.935 --> 00:16:44.618]  And that they actually insert genes into it.
[00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:46.159]  It's cultured on E. coli.
[00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:49.702]  And he said then it's pressed into a white powder.
[00:16:50.363 --> 00:16:58.650]  And it is, you know, chipped out and then made into the actual NutraSweet product.
[00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.714]  And we have the Material Safety Data Sheet on WNHO.net.
[00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:05.115]  And it's
[00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:11.693]  You actually have to wear protective clothing even to go into the plant.
[00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:13.195]  Stop right there.
[00:17:13.235 --> 00:17:14.136]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:17:14.156 --> 00:17:19.324]  We're going to keep talking right now and I'll come back to everybody else in just three minutes with Betty Martini.
[00:17:19.364 --> 00:17:19.744]  Here we go.
[00:17:22.498 --> 00:17:23.559]  A day unlike any other.
[00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:26.882]  Betty, we're still on the web right now, so we're going to keep talking.
[00:17:27.222 --> 00:17:30.045]  Specifically though, I mean, how did they originally manufacture it?
[00:17:30.085 --> 00:17:31.406]  I mean, I know that's all very guarded.
[00:17:31.726 --> 00:17:32.587]  What is it made up of?
[00:17:32.607 --> 00:17:39.333]  Because I've had Blaylock and other medical doctors on about it, but specifically from all your research, I mean, how are they making this stuff?
[00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:43.336]  Well, they're culturing it on E. coli bacteria.
[00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:48.361]  There's a methyl ester, you know, that becomes free methyl alcohol.
[00:17:48.877 --> 00:17:53.738]  And the problem is, for instance, they give you this propaganda, well, there's more methanol in oranges.
[00:17:54.318 --> 00:18:02.400]  But the problem is that in oranges, you also have ethanol, which is the antidote for methanol toxicity.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.941]  Yeah, it's balanced, it's neutral.
[00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:11.103]  Right, and as Dr. Walton pointed out in an article in Discovery, it is also bound to pectin.
[00:18:11.643 --> 00:18:16.404]  But when methanol is free, and not bound,
[00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:19.671]  It's so poisonous.
[00:18:20.151 --> 00:18:34.722]  For instance, now the Krakow study has been done, and I flew to Barcelona to talk to Dr. Alomany, and it showed that it actually embalms living tissue and damages DNA.
[00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:39.785]  And in the medical text, it's actually a page on pre-embalming.
[00:18:40.266 --> 00:18:44.989]  And he told me personally, he says, Betty, this is going to kill 200 million people.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.002]  And I said, Dr. Alleman, it already has.
[00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:50.823]  First of all, it's an abortifacient.
[00:18:50.903 --> 00:18:54.406]  It causes all the fatal neurodegenerative diseases.
[00:18:55.126 --> 00:18:59.109]  The Ramazzini study has now showed that it's a multi-potential carcinogen.
[00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:12.679]  He did a second study showing that if a pregnant woman uses it and she is... the baby survives because it's a teratogen and an abortifacient, the child will grow up and get cancer.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.641]  And I said, it is causing
[00:19:15.248 --> 00:19:21.010]  So many of these problems that people are just literally... Yeah, we have all these babies getting cancer now.
[00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:25.832]  I mean, the cancer rate in children... Well, a lot of them are being born with brain tumors.
[00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:32.095]  And the new statistics is 1 in 10 worldwide now is autistic.
[00:19:32.535 --> 00:19:34.616]  And that is absolutely outrageous.
[00:19:35.436 --> 00:19:35.777]  And so...
[00:19:37.548 --> 00:19:39.509]  It's the formula of death.
[00:19:39.589 --> 00:19:40.609]  And they're proliferating.
[00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:43.390]  Last time I checked, it was over 10,000 products.
[00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.710]  What's the latest number?
[00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.631]  Well, they just admitted 6,000 products.
[00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:57.213]  But the problem is that they can put it in artificial and natural flavors.
[00:19:57.293 --> 00:20:02.435]  We have to tell people, do not use anything processed, because then it's hidden.
[00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:06.476]  For instance, if you were to pick up a product and it said vanilla on it,
[00:20:07.324 --> 00:20:11.908]  You wouldn't know that aspartame is in it, but they mix it with a sweetener and it's usually aspartame.
[00:20:11.988 --> 00:20:12.549]  Alright, stay there.
[00:20:12.569 --> 00:20:13.810]  Yeah, they call it a flavoring.
[00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.291]  Here we go, back to the full audience.
[00:20:15.311 --> 00:20:17.053]  That was on air as well, but this is the full audience.
[00:20:17.073 --> 00:20:17.333]  Here we go.
[00:20:23.186 --> 00:20:25.349]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.813]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:29.674 --> 00:20:31.516]  Betty Martini is our guest.
[00:20:31.536 --> 00:20:34.880]  You can read all the government reports and private studies and others at her website.
[00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:38.024]  She'll give you her site and some other sites here in just a moment.
[00:20:38.044 --> 00:20:39.566]  In fact, Betty, do that now and then
[00:20:40.984 --> 00:20:46.768]  Let's get into how many products Aspartame is really in, what we know, what other governments are saying they know it does.
[00:20:47.709 --> 00:20:54.554]  For those that have problems dealing with this, there have been all sorts of drugs and chemicals they've said aren't bad for you that turn out causing problems and they remove them.
[00:20:55.155 --> 00:20:55.715]  But not now.
[00:20:55.735 --> 00:21:00.799]  It comes out that the chemicals in most plastics are estrogen mimicking and endocrine disruptors.
[00:21:01.199 --> 00:21:02.260]  They just keep it in the market.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:08.982]  It's killed tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands sick now in China from melamine coming into the U.S.
[00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:11.663]  China says it's bad, executes people that put it in.
[00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:13.623]  Our government says no problem with melamine.
[00:21:14.023 --> 00:21:15.064]  Just like with aspartame.
[00:21:15.404 --> 00:21:17.484]  They say mercury is good for children and shots.
[00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:21.946]  When all these major universities show it is the most destructive heavy metal to brain tissue.
[00:21:22.206 --> 00:21:25.547]  Causes electrochemical, literally short circuits and explosions.
[00:21:26.127 --> 00:21:31.652]  It just keeps cutting through the nerves and causes, well you can see it under an electron microscope, they're electrochemical.
[00:21:31.672 --> 00:21:36.295]  It literally is little explosions in the brain, little electrical shorts going on.
[00:21:37.316 --> 00:21:43.020]  So we have them telling us all these poisons are so great, but I can think of no poison worldwide as prolific as aspartame.
[00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:43.561]  In the U.S.
[00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:49.946]  sodium fluoride and its derivatives and subgroups in the water is probably worse than aspartame just because everybody's exposed to it.
[00:21:52.407 --> 00:22:03.830]  Okay, first of all, I have in front of me the statement from Dr. Deagle about how it's made, and maybe this will help you understand.
[00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.871]  He says, Most people, when asked how aspartame is made, do not have the first step of understanding.
[00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:18.114]  While an ER doctor and primary care physician in Augusta in 87 and 88, I was told a number of interesting facts about the adjacent aspartame factory.
[00:22:18.638 --> 00:22:28.322]  Bacteria with genes inserted generate a sludge which is centrifuged to remove the aspartame and many hundreds of contaminant organic and amino acids are present.
[00:22:28.742 --> 00:22:36.925]  We were told not to report illness or organs compensation issues for fear of being fired by the hospital, now the Augusta Region Medical Center.
[00:22:37.366 --> 00:22:45.929]  Many of their employees presented with psychiatric neuropathy conditions, chronic fatigue and organic cases of loss of cognitive function.
[00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.572]  What's going on around the world now?
[00:22:47.592 --> 00:22:49.554]  I lectured in New Zealand when Abby Cormack
[00:23:12.737 --> 00:23:15.158]  Almost died from Wrigley's Aspartame gum.
[00:23:15.198 --> 00:23:28.804]  And I want to warn people, because after a suit was filed against them because of this in 2004, although it was, they got out of it, Wrigley's arrogantly turned around and put it in all but two of their gums.
[00:23:29.004 --> 00:23:39.709]  It is the most dangerous product because, as Dr. Roberts wrote a paper on it, it works like nitroglycerin under the tongue, goes through saliva, straight to the brain.
[00:23:40.416 --> 00:23:50.843]  And they were about to diagnose her with bipolar until she found out, and I went over and lectured in the medical schools, and now they are petitioning for the ban in New Zealand.
[00:23:51.864 --> 00:23:59.049]  In the Philippines, in fact, I just happened to meet their councilman who was trying to get it banned there.
[00:23:59.269 --> 00:24:06.574]  I talked to the California Board of Medicine, and he came in from the Philippines and talked about what was going on there.
[00:24:07.673 --> 00:24:08.734]  By the way, let me stop you.
[00:24:08.774 --> 00:24:10.615]  I just looked up how aspartame is made.
[00:24:10.635 --> 00:24:19.119]  I'm on university websites and it says it is a organic, there's a whole bunch of these, a organic fermentation process.
[00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:28.744]  So what, what, what Deagle said, I mean, I've read this before separately, but I mean, if you just Google it, it's on university sites and it says they ferment it like beer.
[00:24:29.165 --> 00:24:30.405]  So it is bacteria.
[00:24:30.805 --> 00:24:31.226]  Go ahead.
[00:24:31.646 --> 00:24:32.987]  It's made from bacteria.
[00:24:33.047 --> 00:24:33.287]  Yes.
[00:24:33.927 --> 00:24:35.008]  It's pretty well known now.
[00:24:36.875 --> 00:24:45.401]  Recently, now it's been two or three years, Parliament, there were 40... Hold on, here it is!
[00:24:45.482 --> 00:24:55.950]  Genetically engineered bacteria, which are fed these altered amino acids, and over the course of three days, the amino acids are harvested and the bacteria are destroyed.
[00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:57.091]  Yeah, it's true!
[00:24:57.511 --> 00:25:00.534]  Oh my God, I'm reading the actual photos of this!
[00:25:00.614 --> 00:25:01.134]  Oh my gosh!
[00:25:01.234 --> 00:25:02.255]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:25:02.275 --> 00:25:02.656]  Go ahead.
[00:25:04.864 --> 00:25:08.566]  Yes, it's absolutely in the records now.
[00:25:09.787 --> 00:25:13.409]  But anyway, 47 members of Parliament signed for a ban.
[00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:21.213]  So now the European Food Safety Authority is now doing another review, which will end in January.
[00:25:21.794 --> 00:25:25.816]  And it would just be wonderful if we could get it banned in Europe.
[00:25:26.896 --> 00:25:33.120]  We did try in Hawaii last year, and we had problems with it.
[00:25:33.644 --> 00:25:38.868]  But we are trying to get a co-sponsor now to go back through the Hawaiian legislature.
[00:25:39.589 --> 00:25:51.859]  And then I testified for the New Mexico House and Senate when they tried to ban it and the Capitol was just saturated with lobbyists.
[00:25:52.179 --> 00:25:54.361]  But they're going to try to do that again this year.
[00:25:54.461 --> 00:25:58.665]  So even states in the United States are trying to ban it.
[00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:01.347]  Now here's one of the problems.
[00:26:01.966 --> 00:26:05.509]  In 2002, I wrote a citizen's petition for ban.
[00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:10.953]  You can find it on the FDA website, 190 pages of evidence.
[00:26:11.774 --> 00:26:18.079]  And the law states that they must answer it in 180 days, and they have refused to do it.
[00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:20.041]  I mean, it's been six and a half years.
[00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:27.967]  And the reason they refuse to serve above the law is I'm using their own government documents and what they said themselves.
[00:26:28.027 --> 00:26:28.908]  They can't answer it.
[00:26:29.491 --> 00:26:36.395]  So, an attorney told me to go ahead and file an amendment as an imminent health hazard, and I did that in October.
[00:26:36.835 --> 00:26:42.019]  That's required by law to be answered within a week or ten days, and they refused to answer that.
[00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:46.201]  That's the big problem, no matter who does it.
[00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:55.807]  The Community Nutrition Institute petitioned the FDA to ban it in 86, because so many people were going blind from the free methyl alcohol and having seizures.
[00:26:56.744 --> 00:26:58.846]  And he took it all the way to the Supreme Court.
[00:26:58.866 --> 00:26:59.646]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[00:26:59.686 --> 00:27:02.668]  I'm looking at the manufacturing process here from a university website.
[00:27:02.689 --> 00:27:04.250]  We're going to put it up on screen later.
[00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:19.141]  They admit they take aspheric acid and phenylalanine, combine it in tanks, then put genetically modified bacteria in, then put it into a crystal separator, and then dry it into a white powder after separating the dead bacteria.
[00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:29.653]  And it's admitted that, I mean, they admit mainstream, I'm looking at it, that once it hits 87 degrees, it breaks back into the wood alcohol where your body is, what, 98 degrees?
[00:27:30.113 --> 00:27:31.715]  I mean, this is insane!
[00:27:31.735 --> 00:27:38.383]  I mean, antifreeze is sweet, why don't we just start putting that in gum and answer that question and then...
[00:27:39.384 --> 00:27:43.165]  Going back to this, why now can't I buy any major bubble gum?
[00:27:43.185 --> 00:27:52.069]  I mean, I can go to the shopping center, I can go to a major grocery store, because I like gum sometimes, you know, for breath or whatever, and I can't find one.
[00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:55.130]  I have to order it special online that doesn't say aspartame.
[00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.071]  Well, let me give you a little bit of good news.
[00:27:57.911 --> 00:28:05.554]  First of all, I was talking to someone who makes herbs from the Amazon rainforest some years ago, and I said, look, it doesn't take a
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.441]  A rocket scientist to make a safe sweetener.
[00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:11.662]  And these products are killing diabetics.
[00:28:12.422 --> 00:28:13.683]  And he turned around and made it.
[00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:27.409]  And it's called, just like sugar, and it has chicory, which has been used for 70 years to improve the health of diabetics, and orange peel, vitamin C, and calcium.
[00:28:28.049 --> 00:28:35.872]  And then Dr. Blalock asked that it be analyzed, and he wrote in his newsletter, the Blalock Wellness Report, finally.
[00:28:36.707 --> 00:28:38.647]  Finally, a safe sweetener.
[00:28:39.168 --> 00:28:46.969]  And I talked to the CEO, and I said, look, so many people are having the problems with the gum.
[00:28:46.989 --> 00:28:49.810]  They're putting it in everything, and it's the most dangerous product.
[00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:57.291]  And he said, I promise you, by the end of December, we will have a gum free of aspartame, made with just like sugar.
[00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:05.733]  And I said, while you're at it, how about, you know, on every restaurant table, they have Splenda, which is the chlorocarbon poison.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.941]  And equal, and he says, and we'll make packets.
[00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:21.707]  So I have no financial association, of course, with the company, but they are getting this month a congressional award for making the first safe sweetener in America.
[00:29:22.267 --> 00:29:35.113]  So I'm glad with all this bad news to give you a little bit of good news that there will be a gum that's safe, because even some of the Wrigley gums that have aspartame in it, they also have Splenda in it,
[00:29:35.612 --> 00:29:50.810]  They have a sulfine potassium, which caused cancer and leukemia in original studies, and there was a study in Liverpool that told about the combination of all these poisons.
[00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:53.694]  I mean, it's just really a chemical feast.
[00:29:55.607 --> 00:30:04.531]  Well, what we have is chemical companies getting rid of soap and giving us toxic byproducts of the oil industry, which is detergents.
[00:30:04.972 --> 00:30:10.875]  What we have is the chemical companies and biocompanies getting rid of our sugar and giving us this chemical weapon.
[00:30:11.235 --> 00:30:12.876]  They're replacing everything
[00:30:13.456 --> 00:30:15.498]  Well, we've basically got all those records.
[00:30:15.558 --> 00:30:19.922]  In fact, if you really want to know about this study, one of the best articles ever written, it's on mpwhi.com,
[00:30:41.138 --> 00:30:41.218]  It's
[00:30:53.448 --> 00:30:59.631]  Aspartame was listed with the Pentagon in an Inventory of Prospective Biochemical Warfare Weapons submitted to Congress.
[00:31:00.051 --> 00:31:03.573]  Oh, and it accidentally got in all the food oil, like everything else!
[00:31:04.253 --> 00:31:04.553]  Oh!
[00:31:04.573 --> 00:31:05.474]  Oh!
[00:31:06.194 --> 00:31:07.455]  Population control!
[00:31:07.755 --> 00:31:08.115]  Oh!
[00:31:08.375 --> 00:31:10.876]  I notice the Pentagon doesn't want to discuss it with me.
[00:31:12.317 --> 00:31:21.441]  But, and you know we've had to start a Mission Possible Aviation, and the reason I did that was because a pilot called me and he said, dumb, I'm not.
[00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:25.386]  But I crashed my plane on aspartame.
[00:31:25.786 --> 00:31:26.847]  I couldn't make a decision.
[00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:33.990]  You know, it destroys memory, which is one of the reasons that it, you know, escalating Alzheimer's, and it causes confusion.
[00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:39.292]  And so, Dr. Blair... Yeah, they're now saying you get Alzheimer's when you're 30 now.
[00:31:40.132 --> 00:31:40.632]  Oh, yes.
[00:31:40.912 --> 00:31:45.694]  You know, in fact, one of the hospices called me some years ago and asked why 30-year-old people were getting it.
[00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:54.665]  Uh, you know, the reason that aspartame interacts with most drugs is because of damage to the mitochondria or life itself.
[00:31:55.165 --> 00:31:57.189]  And what that does is make you old.
[00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:00.452]  And aspartame knows no age.
[00:32:00.472 --> 00:32:01.012]  That's right.
[00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:10.258]  Inside of the cells, the engine of the cells and its programming is the mitochondrial DNA and they're showing studies that it's damaging the very DNA of the species.
[00:32:10.738 --> 00:32:11.979]  Betty, let's continue speaking.
[00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:15.962]  This is so vital and we have limited time for internet listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:32:15.982 --> 00:32:16.842]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:32:16.862 --> 00:32:17.703]  Everybody else will be back.
[00:32:17.983 --> 00:32:18.804]  This is just too important.
[00:32:18.824 --> 00:32:20.565]  We've got to get all this info out in the time we have.
[00:32:22.583 --> 00:32:24.025]  Okay, Betty, we're continuing.
[00:32:24.065 --> 00:32:29.391]  We've got tens of thousands of listeners and viewers right now, not the millions, but on the web it'll live forever.
[00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:30.712]  Let's continue.
[00:32:31.233 --> 00:32:31.713]  Go back.
[00:32:31.733 --> 00:32:32.895]  Do you have that posted?
[00:32:32.915 --> 00:32:35.277]  Because I read that years ago and then couldn't find it again.
[00:32:36.678 --> 00:32:41.402]  Okay, first of all, if you want to know it, you know, fact by fact, you can go to Doorway, d-o-r-w-a-y dot com, and look for the paper
[00:33:06.124 --> 00:33:11.206]  Nuclear Poison by Alex Constantine, and it will give you all the details.
[00:33:12.927 --> 00:33:23.250]  The ecologist also quotes one of the newsletters, and I actually have one of the tapes of a radio program called Aspartame Weapons of War.
[00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:28.012]  But I want to tell you the worst case scenario, some of the things that are happening.
[00:33:28.052 --> 00:33:31.514]  Dr. Blalock has written an athlete alert.
[00:33:32.774 --> 00:33:35.315]  The athletes are dropping dead from aspartame.
[00:33:35.894 --> 00:33:42.957]  And if you remember, FEDRA was taken off the market because the pilcher who was in West Palm Beach dropped dead.
[00:33:43.777 --> 00:33:50.359]  And Dr. Roberts called medical examiners and said, OK, how many diet drinks was he drinking?
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.360]  He didn't know about it.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.622]  But then an article came out that he was fasting.
[00:33:56.662 --> 00:34:00.623]  And then every couple of days, you know, he would just drink Diet Coke all day.
[00:34:01.303 --> 00:34:05.585]  And the reason that I'm bringing this up also, because in the movie,
[00:34:06.215 --> 00:34:10.218]  Sweet misery, and this is really one of the worst scenarios.
[00:34:10.939 --> 00:34:23.328]  Diane Fleming, a sweet Sunday school teacher, was married to an athlete who worked out and was using aspartame all day long, and died of methanol poisoning.
[00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:29.813]  And they put her in prison for 30 and 20 years, even though she had taken three lie detector tests.
[00:34:30.274 --> 00:34:33.236]  Now, it said acute chronic methanol poisoning,
[00:34:33.963 --> 00:34:43.270]  And the doctors wrote affidavits that the autopsy showed, you know, that it was, uh, that it was aspartame, uh, that caused his death.
[00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.613]  Uh, recently a toxicologist did a study.
[00:34:49.094 --> 00:34:55.318]  The last thing that he, that he drank, he took some Gatorade and put three times the amount of creatine in it.
[00:34:55.738 --> 00:34:57.680]  And aspartame interacts with creatine.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.521]  He was like standing on a,
[00:35:00.303 --> 00:35:10.228]  On a ledge, and that's all it took was that three times the amount of creatine and the toxicological report by Dr. Albiotti showed that it caused his immediate death.
[00:35:10.728 --> 00:35:11.929]  And this is what's going on.
[00:35:11.969 --> 00:35:19.533]  That woman's been in prison for six years and even though doctors have written affidavits, we haven't been able to get her out.
[00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:27.457]  And Dr. Bowen says, here's what happens, is that the liver can take so much
[00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:30.583]  of this methanol when it converts to formaldehyde.
[00:35:30.663 --> 00:35:33.746]  So it kicks it back into the bloodstream.
[00:35:34.406 --> 00:35:40.972]  And there's going to be a book written about her, but I want people to know about Diane Fleming and to read some of the articles.
[00:35:40.992 --> 00:35:44.255]  They're on WNHO.com.
[00:35:44.655 --> 00:35:51.401]  There is Sudden Cardiac Death by Dr. Blaylock and Sudden Death by Dr. Roberts.
[00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:55.284]  Basically what happens is aspartame causes neurodegenerative heart rhythm
[00:35:56.045 --> 00:36:03.050]  And, uh, interacts with all cardiac medication, damages the cardiac conduction system, and causes sudden death.
[00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:14.338]  And even little children and students are actually dropping dead from it, and two parliamentarians in Europe aren't realizing why people were dropping dead.
[00:36:14.418 --> 00:36:22.083]  I petitioned WHO to, uh, to actually call it sudden death syndrome so they can
[00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:23.981]  So they can crack it.
[00:36:24.161 --> 00:36:24.801]  Alright, here we go.
[00:36:24.861 --> 00:36:25.762]  Back to the full audience.
[00:36:30.602 --> 00:36:39.864]  If you just Google Aspartame Army Chemical Biological Weapon, you'll discover how it was developed in the US.
[00:36:41.164 --> 00:36:44.825]  Chemical weapon to brain damage subject populations.
[00:36:46.165 --> 00:36:50.466]  And I've got the London Independent here from the 20th
[00:36:52.888 --> 00:37:14.447]  of uh... what july nineteen ninety nine world's top sweeteners made with gm bacteria and uh... it is a uh... chemical weapon derived from a biological uh... weapon mix and of course that's why it's in most your food you buy prepared because they're exterminating it's not that you can't imagine this you can't make this up you can't
[00:37:15.532 --> 00:37:16.132]  Everything they do.
[00:37:16.372 --> 00:37:19.374]  Oh, the GMO just so happens to sterilize the mice that eat it.
[00:37:19.714 --> 00:37:21.615]  And then the humans get it and our fertility is dropping.
[00:37:21.995 --> 00:37:24.736]  Oh, melamine just so happens to kill kids.
[00:37:24.756 --> 00:37:32.079]  Oh, the one type of plastic they chose out of hundreds to be standardized as the main plastic sterilizes people and gives you cancer.
[00:37:32.099 --> 00:37:35.260]  Oh, and there's an Army report on that.
[00:37:36.101 --> 00:37:38.482]  Army figures this out, they put it in your food.
[00:37:39.465 --> 00:37:41.306]  Now, does that mean the average person in the Army is involved?
[00:37:41.366 --> 00:37:41.586]  No.
[00:37:41.907 --> 00:37:42.927]  It's the eugenicist.
[00:37:43.548 --> 00:37:47.590]  It's the eugenicist, and that's why there's dead kids all over your neighborhood from cancer.
[00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:50.112]  That's why 23-year-old women are dying of cancer.
[00:37:50.332 --> 00:37:51.633]  That's why it's exploding in there.
[00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:54.135]  Betty Martini, please continue.
[00:37:54.855 --> 00:38:01.880]  Okay, when you mention that article, I have to tell you a story about that, written on the front page of the Independent.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.683]  Not only on the front page, but above the Royal Wedding.
[00:38:06.143 --> 00:38:07.504]  And the way that came to be,
[00:38:08.343 --> 00:38:21.611]  Is that one of the aspartame companies actually had on their website the formula for genetic engineering and people just didn't realize what it was.
[00:38:21.711 --> 00:38:27.314]  And I was talking to the independent and I told him, I says, you know, you people don't like genetic engineering.
[00:38:27.334 --> 00:38:29.416]  Why don't you help us with aspartame?
[00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:31.737]  And they said, prove it and we'll help you.
[00:38:32.501 --> 00:38:38.524]  And so, when I put that online, they immediately took the website down, but it was too late.
[00:38:38.604 --> 00:38:51.971]  I had printed it out and faxed it to the Independent in the UK, and they kept their word, put it on the front page above the Royal Wedding, so that all of the UK could find out about it.
[00:38:51.991 --> 00:38:57.634]  Yeah, that's what they report, is this is directly from the Aspartame manufacturer, so our source is that.
[00:38:57.694 --> 00:39:01.916]  Yeah, Monsanto could not deny it, because there was, on the website,
[00:39:02.481 --> 00:39:04.742]  Showing the actual formula for this.
[00:39:05.323 --> 00:39:14.788]  Another thing that people should know really worries me about what's happening to the vets, because they're now reporting how many of them are going blind.
[00:39:14.808 --> 00:39:16.169]  You know that's from aspartame.
[00:39:16.709 --> 00:39:27.936]  But if you get on WNHO.net and go back to 2003, you can read a report I wrote, the case for aspartame disease being Gulf War Illness and Lou Gehrig's.
[00:39:28.476 --> 00:39:32.098]  Because the government back then was saying, you know, they're crazy.
[00:39:32.777 --> 00:39:39.361]  And then they did their own study, and I had told them it causes, it can precipitate MS and cause Lou Gehrig's.
[00:39:39.421 --> 00:39:42.043]  Dr. James Bowen has Lou Gehrig's Masturbatine.
[00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:47.126]  And when they did their own studies, they found it was Lou Gehrig's.
[00:39:47.706 --> 00:39:51.088]  So now, you know, they're chewing gum and drinking it in Iraq.
[00:39:51.288 --> 00:39:54.610]  Here they are, you know, fighting for our country.
[00:39:55.291 --> 00:39:58.052]  And, you know, being killed by aspartame.
[00:39:58.472 --> 00:40:01.474]  Well, I mean, you know, I mentioned that I know this is a setup.
[00:40:01.554 --> 00:40:03.415]  I mean, I see the same story over and over again.
[00:40:04.355 --> 00:40:07.737]  Fighting this for 17 years, interviewing scientists, doctors, all these government reports.
[00:40:08.457 --> 00:40:11.418]  You know, you helping get governments to ban it around the world, or restrict it.
[00:40:12.078 --> 00:40:14.159]  I mean, do you believe that this was done by design?
[00:40:17.501 --> 00:40:20.142]  Well, you know, I cannot say.
[00:40:20.382 --> 00:40:21.803]  I mean, there's no way to say.
[00:40:22.363 --> 00:40:24.604]  But I do know that Thoreau knew it.
[00:40:25.034 --> 00:40:31.099]  Because I have talked to so many informants and people from Searle, they said they all knew that it was poison.
[00:40:31.759 --> 00:40:34.442]  And they knew it before they put it on the market.
[00:40:35.282 --> 00:40:38.545]  But I mean, the Army discovers it and says it's a chemical weapon.
[00:40:40.226 --> 00:40:42.908]  And then suddenly it's Rumsfeld and it's in all our food.
[00:40:42.949 --> 00:40:43.549]  I mean, you know.
[00:40:43.949 --> 00:40:45.110]  You know what they call it now?
[00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:47.092]  Rumsfeld Plague.
[00:40:47.512 --> 00:40:48.793]  That's right, Rumsfeld Disease.
[00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:49.774]  Yes.
[00:40:50.855 --> 00:40:54.598]  Well, the medical text is Aspartame Disease.
[00:40:55.106 --> 00:40:59.630]  And Dr. Roberts says we're not going to call it Rumsfeld Disease because they usually honor doctors.
[00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:11.901]  So it's called Rumsfeld Plague and the Idaho Observer wrote a great, fantastic article on biochemical weaponry and Rumsfeld's legacy.
[00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:15.704]  And incidentally, somebody has written a book
[00:41:16.784 --> 00:41:20.586]  On Rumsfeld, it even tells the whole story.
[00:41:20.686 --> 00:41:23.608]  Rumsfeld, his rise, fall, and catastrophic legacy.
[00:41:23.668 --> 00:41:27.891]  Well listen, he's the one that gave nuclear reactors as the head of ABB to North Korea.
[00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:31.293]  He's the one that got the Terminator genes and GMO approved.
[00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:34.655]  It's like whatever is evil, he gave the bioweapons of Saddam.
[00:41:34.955 --> 00:41:38.517]  It's like a poop of smoke and he's like the devil and he's there at the scene of everything.
[00:41:39.337 --> 00:41:40.178]  I know, I know.
[00:41:40.318 --> 00:41:42.339]  And this is, they actually told this.
[00:41:42.419 --> 00:41:45.241]  In fact, I sent this to Atlanta Magazine when they interviewed me.
[00:41:45.754 --> 00:41:50.576]  And they actually put this in their story right here in the home of Coca-Cola.
[00:41:50.796 --> 00:41:58.300]  And when the reporter came out, you know, I said, you're really going to write a story about aspartame here in the home of Coca-Cola?
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.022]  And it turned out the reporter was the victim.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.443]  And then the photographers came out and I said, who do you work for?
[00:42:06.463 --> 00:42:07.904]  He said, mostly for Coke.
[00:42:08.064 --> 00:42:11.166]  I said, then you're going to take a picture of... Hold on, hold on.
[00:42:11.206 --> 00:42:11.907]  Here we go, here we go.
[00:42:12.487 --> 00:42:13.388]  We're on the march.
[00:42:13.888 --> 00:42:15.490]  The empire's on the run.
[00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.952]  Alex Jones and the GCI Radio Network.
[00:42:18.972 --> 00:42:21.554]  Let's skip this break, too, because we've got to go soon.
[00:42:21.574 --> 00:42:28.619]  I want you to get John Wodkin's Enough Respect on in like five minutes and just let him know we're going to say bye to Betty on the other side, OK?
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:29.260]  OK.
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:30.681]  Let me talk to Betty again.
[00:42:31.912 --> 00:42:32.854]  Here I am, Alex.
[00:42:33.075 --> 00:42:35.621]  Hey Betty, I probably interviewed you ten times years ago.
[00:42:36.162 --> 00:42:38.146]  What, it's been five years or so since I had you on?
[00:42:38.527 --> 00:42:39.850]  I think it has been that long.
[00:42:40.319 --> 00:42:48.406]  Well, you know, I hit subjects a lot, then I get off of them, and then I thought, you know, I've got a whole new giant crop of listeners, bigger than ever, and we haven't warned them.
[00:42:48.666 --> 00:42:50.268]  And this is something where we can take action.
[00:42:50.288 --> 00:42:51.889]  We can stop drinking fluoridated water.
[00:42:52.209 --> 00:42:54.211]  We can stop drinking and eating aspartame.
[00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:55.532]  We can educate other people.
[00:42:55.892 --> 00:42:57.174]  We can save a lot of lives.
[00:42:57.674 --> 00:43:00.817]  And so I want to get you back up for a full two hours in the near future.
[00:43:00.837 --> 00:43:01.938]  Sorry to cut you a bit short today.
[00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:02.979]  I got behind with the other guest.
[00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:10.680]  And then I'm going to have Dr. Blaylock on in the next few weeks, and anybody else you want to recommend, why don't you email Aaron with two A's?
[00:43:11.261 --> 00:43:28.024]  Aaron at InfoWars.com, the different doctors and scientists you think I should have on, and I'll do 215 interviews in the next few months, because I'm just sticking now with what can I tell people where they can help themselves that we know is bad that's happening to them, solutions, solutions, solutions.
[00:43:28.824 --> 00:43:41.911]  Not just that, you were such a great example, and I'm not trying to toot your horn, I mean, people should model after you and others, of somebody getting mad, getting upset, taking action, and really having a huge effect in the 17 years you've been doing this.
[00:43:41.971 --> 00:43:51.336]  Because as bad as it is, you know, I mean, at least you have warned tens of millions of people to themselves stay away from it, or to know what's happening.
[00:43:51.536 --> 00:43:56.099]  But then in closing, we're going to come back with about five minutes left with you, if you can do it.
[00:43:56.639 --> 00:43:57.400]  How do we
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:01.962]  Well, I mean, we know the patent ended, so now it's even cheaper, so everybody's using it.
[00:44:02.503 --> 00:44:03.763]  I mean, it's in everything now.
[00:44:04.204 --> 00:44:08.226]  And as you said, they call it artificial or natural flavoring.
[00:44:08.947 --> 00:44:10.287]  I mean, how do you find this out?
[00:44:10.328 --> 00:44:12.229]  I guess you just don't eat anything processed?
[00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:14.650]  Well, yes, we have to.
[00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:23.215]  And incidentally, Dr. Blaylock wrote me a paper, what to do if you've used aspartame, so I can give this to people.
[00:44:23.256 --> 00:44:23.916]  And we have.
[00:44:24.565 --> 00:44:25.065]  I don't know.
[00:44:48.776 --> 00:44:51.697]  that keep current on aspartame for distribution.
[00:44:51.757 --> 00:44:52.097]  Good, good.
[00:44:52.117 --> 00:44:52.897]  I'll have them on.
[00:44:52.978 --> 00:44:56.179]  So email me those guys and I'll recommend that.
[00:44:56.239 --> 00:44:57.819]  Betty, we're going to come back in about 20 seconds.
[00:44:58.259 --> 00:44:59.360]  Okay.
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.780]  I'm just doing five more minutes with her.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.161]  Do you have the next guest?
[00:45:03.581 --> 00:45:05.682]  Yes, Mr. Watkins is all set.
[00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:09.743]  Mr. Watkins of the UK, not Mr. Watson.
[00:45:10.503 --> 00:45:12.864]  Okay, here we go.
[00:45:13.244 --> 00:45:15.245]  I forgot to ask you, what city in England is he in?
[00:45:16.185 --> 00:45:17.826]  Pop in and ask him and then pop in and tell me.
[00:45:18.632 --> 00:45:19.613]  Okay, just over the air?
[00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:19.953]  Yep.
[00:45:20.053 --> 00:45:21.234]  Here we go, folks.
[00:45:23.076 --> 00:45:25.898]  The Babylon system is a vampire.
[00:45:25.938 --> 00:45:28.781]  Suck in the blood.
[00:45:50.646 --> 00:45:52.288]  Sucking the children day by day.
[00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.513]  Melamine, aspartame, mercury.
[00:45:58.777 --> 00:45:59.579]  All of these things.
[00:46:01.882 --> 00:46:04.305]  And then they control the hospitals and the medical system.
[00:46:04.325 --> 00:46:05.106]  The doctors don't know.
[00:46:05.126 --> 00:46:06.027]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:46:13.322 --> 00:46:15.603]  Final segment with Betty Martini and then we're going to spend a little bit of time.
[00:46:15.623 --> 00:46:16.984]  I'm really honored to have him today.
[00:46:17.004 --> 00:46:21.826]  John Wodkin is one of the most talented YouTube directors out there.
[00:46:21.846 --> 00:46:25.648]  This guy lives in Austin, Texas and worked with me on films.
[00:46:27.509 --> 00:46:28.650]  So he is coming up here.
[00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.511]  Well, Betty, we're going to have you back up for two hours in the near future.
[00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:34.913]  I'm going to have Dr. Blalock back on and a lot of other folks, but in closing,
[00:46:36.872 --> 00:46:38.213]  Thousands and thousands of products.
[00:46:38.273 --> 00:46:39.833]  I can't find gun that doesn't have it.
[00:46:39.853 --> 00:46:41.734]  They call it natural, unnatural sweeteners.
[00:46:41.774 --> 00:46:42.495]  They won't let you.
[00:46:42.515 --> 00:46:44.976]  They're camouflaging it now.
[00:46:46.196 --> 00:46:47.057]  And they didn't know before.
[00:46:47.097 --> 00:46:48.417]  They certainly know now it's deadly.
[00:46:48.458 --> 00:46:54.200]  This army chemical weapon made out of genetically engineered bacteria they discovered in the 60s.
[00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:59.223]  Dealing with that issue finally, and then briefly, the addiction.
[00:47:00.435 --> 00:47:03.517]  You know, I had somebody down here this weekend who's a great guy, but I was watching him.
[00:47:03.557 --> 00:47:04.458]  Addicted to Diet Cokes.
[00:47:04.478 --> 00:47:05.118]  He had to have them.
[00:47:05.419 --> 00:47:08.941]  He wanted me to run around and get him Halls, but he said they must be sugar-free.
[00:47:09.402 --> 00:47:12.364]  And he was acting like a drug addict when I would bring him the Aspartame.
[00:47:13.285 --> 00:47:19.689]  And I've seen this with people who get off of Aspartame and literally go through all sorts of withdrawals.
[00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:28.376]  Dr. Blaylock, medical doctor and others, have developed, and you have this free on your website, give out those sites, some systems that will help people detox.
[00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:32.451]  Like many poisons, it's also very addictive.
[00:47:34.292 --> 00:47:35.073]  It is addictive.
[00:47:35.133 --> 00:47:39.135]  It's that free methyl alcohol that causes chronic methanol poisoning.
[00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:44.158]  This affects the dopamine system of the brain and causes the addiction.
[00:47:44.739 --> 00:47:52.383]  And you know, one day I was talking with Dr. Deagle about the fact that when people are that addicted, they're no longer rational.
[00:47:52.443 --> 00:47:55.985]  And he says, well, that's because it first affects the frontal lobes of the brain.
[00:47:56.026 --> 00:47:58.367]  And it's like talking to somebody with a lobotomy.
[00:47:58.894 --> 00:48:08.563]  And a very good case of that is Lane Short's wife, when one of the doctors found out and said, oh, we have found out it's aspartame.
[00:48:08.583 --> 00:48:09.965]  Diabetics can't heal.
[00:48:10.365 --> 00:48:11.646]  We can save your foot.
[00:48:12.127 --> 00:48:14.028]  Just get off of aspartame.
[00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:15.730]  And she said, I'm too addicted.
[00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:16.351]  Chop it off.
[00:48:16.411 --> 00:48:16.991]  And they did.
[00:48:17.912 --> 00:48:19.594]  And that is not rational.
[00:48:19.774 --> 00:48:21.916]  But this is the problem that we have.
[00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:30.364]  is this addiction and Dr. Roberts has written a very, very long article about it that's on the doorway.
[00:48:30.384 --> 00:48:32.504]  And the miscellaneous doctors speak out.
[00:48:32.524 --> 00:48:35.865]  The Townsend Letter for Doctors, that explains it in great detail.
[00:48:40.567 --> 00:48:41.407]  Alex, are you still there?
[00:48:41.447 --> 00:48:42.708]  Yes, Betty, I'm just sitting back.
[00:48:42.748 --> 00:48:44.948]  You know, I have a penchant for interrupting, so I want you to continue.
[00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:49.050]  Yeah, so this is one of the most serious problems, and if
[00:48:50.745 --> 00:48:57.590]  If anyone, you know, gets in touch with us, my email is BettyM19 at Minespring.com.
[00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:01.733]  We can send them Dr. Blalock information about what they have to do.
[00:49:01.773 --> 00:49:08.138]  They have to stay on magnesium the rest of their life because it protects the heart and the brain from excitotoxins.
[00:49:08.218 --> 00:49:12.461]  And Dr. Blalock says you have to flush your system out with distilled water.
[00:49:12.901 --> 00:49:16.004]  You can't use, you know, chlorine or fluoride.
[00:49:17.034 --> 00:49:27.416]  He gives a great list of the things that can help and heal the immune system and tells you all the things to avoid and it's a wonderful paper.
[00:49:28.096 --> 00:49:41.919]  Anybody on it really should get in touch and they can stay up-to-date on this list and they'll get all the information that they want, all the references and the books and movies, anything that they need that can help.
[00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:44.960]  One of the greatest things is getting the information to the doctors
[00:49:45.427 --> 00:49:51.472]  Because once a doctor knows, then he can save the lives of thousands.
[00:49:51.953 --> 00:49:55.095]  It's like my neurologist said when he realized who I was.
[00:49:55.596 --> 00:49:56.657]  He said I had a patient.
[00:49:57.077 --> 00:49:58.318]  He said having seizures.
[00:49:58.378 --> 00:50:00.860]  He said that we tried everything there was on the market.
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.804]  He had no idea that it interacts with all anti-seizure medication.
[00:50:05.244 --> 00:50:09.208]  Found out that she was drinking a case of Diet Coke a day.
[00:50:09.268 --> 00:50:10.148]  Got her off of it.
[00:50:10.289 --> 00:50:11.129]  She went crazy.
[00:50:11.149 --> 00:50:13.011]  They had to put her in a mental hospital.
[00:50:13.519 --> 00:50:19.443]  Two weeks out of the mental hospital she was off of aspartame, no problems, and the seizures stopped.
[00:50:19.923 --> 00:50:21.784]  So it's very, very important.
[00:50:21.904 --> 00:50:23.305]  So it's a chemical weapon.
[00:50:23.986 --> 00:50:24.866]  It's a chemical weapon.
[00:50:24.886 --> 00:50:30.590]  Betty Martini, we salute you, we appreciate you for warning people, and we'll talk to you soon.
[00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:31.731]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[00:50:32.191 --> 00:50:32.812]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:33.152 --> 00:50:33.412]  You bet.
[00:50:33.432 --> 00:50:34.012]  There she goes.
[00:50:34.493 --> 00:50:34.913]  Great lady.
[00:50:34.933 --> 00:50:39.296]  We're going to be doing several more shows in a long series on this in the next three months.
[00:50:40.868 --> 00:50:48.958]  Because I had covered this probably a hundred times 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years ago and now we haven't covered it in so long.
[00:50:49.018 --> 00:50:54.525]  I wanted to give you the evidence and yet again a government chemical weapon made by genetically engineered bacteria.
[00:50:55.563 --> 00:50:56.724]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:50:57.285 --> 00:51:05.394]  Alright, Shifting Gears, NuffRespect website on YouTube that we know of has 20-30 million views.
[00:51:05.795 --> 00:51:10.781]  Some of his videos have 5-6 million views per short videos that he makes.
[00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:14.024]  He's an absolutely amazing individual.
[00:51:15.222 --> 00:51:27.675]  And then his videos get copied to hundreds of other video sharing sites and so really we don't know how many tens of millions more have seen his material just in two short years on the internet.
[00:51:27.695 --> 00:51:29.657]  He lives in the United Kingdom in Cardiff.
[00:51:30.038 --> 00:51:34.743]  He's made some great videos with my material that I've really been flattered that he's done that.
[00:51:36.926 --> 00:51:49.135]  He has stood up for us when YouTube and Google have been censoring us, banning our videos, knocking our hit counts down to knock us out of the top ten so that people don't see us there on the front page of YouTube or Google.
[00:51:50.416 --> 00:51:52.658]  He has put out videos.
[00:51:52.958 --> 00:52:00.604]  He won, of the three people that won, we had three different contests, he won one of the contests for the best internet censorship video a few months ago.
[00:52:01.625 --> 00:52:04.267]  He won the first round of contest exposing
[00:52:06.179 --> 00:52:11.221]  The different cocktail, the different ways, there's a lot of different ways they're shutting down, regulating the web.
[00:52:11.821 --> 00:52:13.701]  Obama has announced upgrading the internet.
[00:52:13.721 --> 00:52:19.363]  That is, internet to the consortium to start shutting down the old free open web that we told you about.
[00:52:20.083 --> 00:52:23.724]  They're going to have free internet wireless nationwide with taxpayer money paying for it.
[00:52:23.764 --> 00:52:24.305]  Nothing's free.
[00:52:24.605 --> 00:52:28.826]  It's going to be highly censored with only a few thousand sites of the billions that you can actually visit.
[00:52:29.886 --> 00:52:37.808]  Canada's openly saying they're going to restrict the web, Australia headline in their newspapers, Chinese style censorship, banning all alternative sites basically.
[00:52:39.088 --> 00:52:40.109]  It's here, it's happening.
[00:52:40.869 --> 00:52:47.430]  And he had all these top honors of top director in the UK, one of the top directors in the US, the most hits, the most views.
[00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:51.151]  He was up there in the top 20 in every category.
[00:52:51.631 --> 00:52:53.732]  So they basically restricted him.
[00:52:55.276 --> 00:52:56.778]  Knocked him off the front page.
[00:52:57.478 --> 00:53:00.382]  And again, we don't care about having little blue ribbons for being number one.
[00:53:00.422 --> 00:53:04.866]  We don't care about being on the front page for, you know, the fame or whatever.
[00:53:04.947 --> 00:53:10.152]  It's that that's where the billions of people that visit YouTube and Google go to do their viewing.
[00:53:10.473 --> 00:53:11.554]  It's like the TV Guide.
[00:53:12.694 --> 00:53:19.403]  We know they've been restricting my hit counts, my views, because when you upload a Google video, you can still see what your hits and views are.
[00:53:19.904 --> 00:53:27.755]  When we complained a year ago about them knocking us from 10 million, 20 million views on a video down to zero, they'd build back up in millions in a day, they'd knock it down again.
[00:53:28.456 --> 00:53:31.657]  They just made those numbers secret, unless you're the person that posted it.
[00:53:31.957 --> 00:53:32.797]  You can still see it.
[00:53:33.097 --> 00:53:35.297]  We saw them censor fabled enemies a few months ago.
[00:53:35.317 --> 00:53:40.058]  When it came out, it hit number one within two days, and they just erased our numbers.
[00:53:40.098 --> 00:53:42.938]  There was over a million views because we uploaded it.
[00:53:42.998 --> 00:53:43.719]  We could see that.
[00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:50.740]  Only people that could, us and Google, before it was public, and a year ago they changed it, and we saw them internally knock it off.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.820]  And we also got screenshots of them knocking us off the front page.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.361]  And I have asked people like enough respect
[00:53:58.362 --> 00:54:02.445]  Being censored, being cheated is horrible, but it lets you know you're hurting them.
[00:54:03.065 --> 00:54:06.688]  So please, enough respect, do not leave YouTube.
[00:54:06.748 --> 00:54:09.810]  And all of you, when you get attacked, know it means you're hurting them.
[00:54:10.251 --> 00:54:15.915]  Just start uploading to two or three other backup sites, other smaller video services.
[00:54:15.955 --> 00:54:20.838]  People are on my message board at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com saying, why do you care?
[00:54:20.878 --> 00:54:21.799]  Forget YouTube and Google.
[00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:26.993]  Well, YouTube's like number four or five on the web, Google's number two on the web.
[00:54:27.654 --> 00:54:30.483]  Yeah, there are other sites getting millions of views a day, total.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.581]  But you can get millions of views per video for your video on YouTube and Google.
[00:54:34.942 --> 00:54:37.983]  That's ninety-something percent of the video sharing area.
[00:54:38.683 --> 00:54:39.904]  That's where we need to be.
[00:54:39.964 --> 00:54:41.704]  We don't retreat from the field of battle.
[00:54:42.164 --> 00:54:43.965]  Enough respect is calling on everyone.
[00:54:44.746 --> 00:54:45.026]  Enough.
[00:54:45.086 --> 00:54:48.567]  I'd love it if you made another video including just overall internet censorship.
[00:54:48.607 --> 00:54:51.108]  Now this is the front lines, this fight at YouTube.
[00:54:51.188 --> 00:54:55.450]  I would love to promote that, push that myself, but we're playing in the background.
[00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:57.191]  The challenge you've got for December 19th
[00:54:58.598 --> 00:55:08.024]  To make your video number one overall on YouTube and then to show people if they do censor and keep you off the front page as they do my videos.
[00:55:08.064 --> 00:55:09.505]  And again, this is how it all starts.
[00:55:10.046 --> 00:55:18.792]  We know that Lieberman and others in the Congress with the Violent Radicalization Act have said, we want to censor the web, we want the government to tell you what to take down, what to put up.
[00:55:19.372 --> 00:55:25.633]  We see YouTube shifting away from user-made videos that have made it so popular to fluff and corporate videos on the front page.
[00:55:25.953 --> 00:55:26.973]  They did that this weekend.
[00:55:26.993 --> 00:55:30.334]  There was a huge backlash, so they stopped it for the time being.
[00:55:30.374 --> 00:55:34.075]  But they say on their rules page that they're probably going to go back to this.
[00:55:34.155 --> 00:55:37.815]  So they let us build YouTube and Google up, then they kick us off of it.
[00:55:38.175 --> 00:55:42.336]  And so without further ado, we go to John Wadkins in Cardiff in the United Kingdom.
[00:55:42.836 --> 00:55:45.337]  And I've never talked to you in person.
[00:55:45.657 --> 00:55:47.217]  John, we appreciate you coming on with us.
[00:55:48.075 --> 00:55:50.077]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on the show.
[00:55:50.097 --> 00:55:52.459]  It is a real pleasure to be able to speak with you.
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:54.601]  I mean, yeah, you were so right.
[00:55:54.661 --> 00:55:56.223]  Everything you said is just so right.
[00:55:56.323 --> 00:56:13.079]  You know, this censorship issue is something that we really can't afford to ignore because, you know, it's our free speech we're talking about really, you know, and I noticed this, you know, the first time I actually noticed this kind of censorship taking place on the internet was about two years ago when
[00:56:13.689 --> 00:56:27.614]  Google started censoring movies like Peristorm and Loose Change, and the censorship was just so crude and so obvious and so sneaky that it was just infuriating to watch.
[00:56:27.674 --> 00:56:36.718]  I mean, for example, as you said, resetting the hit counts on certain videos like Peristorm to knock them out of the top 10 list.
[00:56:36.738 --> 00:56:40.439]  When I saw that, first of all, I thought, well, maybe it is some kind of software error.
[00:56:41.061 --> 00:56:44.843]  It was happening so often, and it only seemed to happen for truth videos.
[00:56:45.463 --> 00:56:53.827]  And another thing I noticed was that on Google Video, they would display the top 10 videos on their homepage.
[00:56:54.528 --> 00:56:59.190]  And now, at this time, two years ago, I think Terror, Storm and Loose Change were there in the top 10.
[00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:04.653]  They displayed every other video that was in the top 10 on their homepage, except Terror, Storm and Loose Change.
[00:57:04.673 --> 00:57:09.615]  And again, you know, that set a few alarm bells ringing, you know, in my mind.
[00:57:10.399 --> 00:57:25.745]  Then in February of 2007, a couple of months later, Google pulled the infamous BBC video where they reported that Building 7 had collapsed, you know, 20 minutes before it actually did collapse.
[00:57:26.706 --> 00:57:31.567]  And, you know, every time somebody tried to upload that video, it was pulled within minutes.
[00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:34.389]  And it really was laughable to see.
[00:57:34.429 --> 00:57:36.529]  You know, you could sense the panic at Google.
[00:57:36.569 --> 00:57:37.710]  They didn't want that video
[00:57:38.402 --> 00:57:38.642]  You think?
[00:57:53.388 --> 00:57:55.669]  Videos were actually the most popular.
[00:57:55.689 --> 00:57:57.809]  We just basically had to take Google's word for it.
[00:57:57.969 --> 00:58:04.471]  And YouTube is now moving in that same direction, as is Myspace and many others, censoring at every level.
[00:58:04.531 --> 00:58:10.432]  So, it's here, it's happening, and they shouldn't hold themselves out as this free, open community.
[00:58:11.252 --> 00:58:18.514]  And then, when our videos don't violate any other rules or terms, they go in and specifically target them for censorship.
[00:58:18.574 --> 00:58:20.515]  This is false advertising.
[00:58:20.555 --> 00:58:21.315]  This is fraud.
[00:58:22.188 --> 00:58:24.409]  Exactly, that's exactly what it is.
[00:58:24.529 --> 00:58:38.278]  It is fraudulent, you know, and it was this censorship that I ran two years ago on Google that made me want to start up a YouTube channel, and back then Google didn't own YouTube, and there wasn't that much censorship going on on YouTube at that time.
[00:58:38.298 --> 00:58:49.325]  There probably was some, but it was nothing like it is today, you know, so at that time I thought, you know, I'll put out some videos on YouTube and hopefully try and get this information out there to people, you know, and
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:55.244]  So, you know, it's thanks to you, Alex, and people like you that, you know, I've been able to expand my worldview.
[00:58:55.304 --> 00:59:04.452]  And when you sort of, when you realize the manipulation that's taking place, you know, due to this globalist elite, the first thing you want to do is inform other people.
[00:59:04.512 --> 00:59:10.576]  And that's what I'm trying to do on YouTube is just to get, you know, info out there to wake people up.
[00:59:10.657 --> 00:59:14.179]  And now it's become so difficult, and it only seems to be
[00:59:15.558 --> 00:59:21.442]  After Google bought YouTube, that is when all the censorship seemed to kick in.
[00:59:21.462 --> 00:59:24.925]  Because it didn't really exist back two years ago.
[00:59:25.025 --> 00:59:28.467]  But now it's rife on YouTube right now.
[00:59:28.627 --> 00:59:32.970]  And that's because we're going into a worldwide controlled depression.
[00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:34.671]  The banks are engineering it.
[00:59:34.692 --> 00:59:35.932]  They're getting ready to launch new wars.
[00:59:35.952 --> 00:59:40.836]  They just tried to start World War III between Pakistan and India, as Paul Watson covered earlier.
[00:59:40.856 --> 00:59:42.177]  We need you to make one on that enough.
[00:59:42.977 --> 00:59:45.178]  Exactly, that's right.
[00:59:45.198 --> 00:59:48.099]  And I think it scares them that we're getting information out there for the masses.
[01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:16.084]  And, you know, I mean on YouTube, the methods of censorship now are just so blatant.
[01:00:16.264 --> 01:00:22.428]  You know, one method is where, I mean, they remove videos under the excuse that they contain inappropriate content.
[01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:25.375]  This has happened to me a few times.
[01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:31.058]  I'll have videos that don't even show a woman in a short skirt and they get banned for inappropriate.
[01:00:31.739 --> 01:00:34.120]  Or people creating fake Alex Jones accounts.
[01:00:34.981 --> 01:00:37.783]  Then they themselves go and complain on me.
[01:00:38.163 --> 01:00:39.303]  Stuff gets shut down.
[01:00:39.864 --> 01:00:43.806]  There's people also editing my videos together where I'm saying racist things.
[01:00:44.727 --> 01:00:46.128]  Tell folks about some of the other tactics.
[01:00:46.966 --> 01:00:53.288]  Well, um, I'd just say, you know, they, they remove videos under the pretense that they contain inappropriate content.
[01:00:53.648 --> 01:00:58.649]  But YouTube doesn't give you any explanation as to what it is that they deem to be inappropriate.
[01:00:58.669 --> 01:01:00.970]  So you're, you're just left in the dark, basically.
[01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:14.414]  And, you know, the one thing I noticed with the videos that they removed of mine, under the pretense of, you know, inappropriate content, they, the one thing they all have in common was that they all chalked up a lot of views within the first
[01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.390]  12 hours.
[01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:18.613]  I think it's like 20,000 views within the first 12 hours.
[01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:27.860]  And so it seems to me that Google doesn't mind us uploading videos that sort of expose what's happening with this globalist agenda.
[01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:35.093]  But they don't seem to like it when those videos, you know, gather a lot of views very quickly, because obviously... Yeah, here's an example.
[01:01:35.133 --> 01:01:37.575]  You made that one about Question Your Reality.
[01:01:37.955 --> 01:01:50.281]  It got 200,000 views in one day, it was number one, and then suddenly the comments kept going up by the thousands, but suddenly it was frozen for a few days, frozen in its hits, to knock it out of the top.
[01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:53.463]  That's right, that's exactly what I do, what they do.
[01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:58.165]  What I noticed with that video was it generated a huge number of hits.
[01:01:58.625 --> 01:01:59.166]  Are you kidding?
[01:01:59.186 --> 01:01:59.646]  200,000 in one day?
[01:02:15.976 --> 01:02:20.242]  I mean, that's just one example of what's happening on YouTube at the moment.
[01:02:20.302 --> 01:02:22.625]  And it only seems to happen with truth videos.
[01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:28.674]  It doesn't seem to happen with all the mainstream sort of stuff, you know, the Britney Spears and all the rest of it.
[01:02:29.034 --> 01:02:31.418]  It's only the kind of videos that I upload.
[01:02:32.037 --> 01:02:33.737]  And it's not just me that it's happening to.
[01:02:33.777 --> 01:02:36.138]  It's happening to so many different channels on YouTube.
[01:02:36.278 --> 01:02:38.459]  Well, now Obama is announcing Internet 2.
[01:02:38.519 --> 01:02:39.019]  That's what it is.
[01:02:39.379 --> 01:02:45.360]  Tens of billions into that is to create the new web, force all of us off, as Internet 2 is declared.
[01:02:45.761 --> 01:02:46.461]  Now is the fight.
[01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:52.242]  We come back in the final segment with the creator of the EnoughRespect channel, YouTube forward slash EnoughRespect.com.
[01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:55.203]  We link to it all the time at InfoWars.com, John Wadkins.
[01:02:55.563 --> 01:03:01.208]  There's so many other great channels like the Alex Jones Channel that a guy runs and they ran off Gatekeeper Invasion.
[01:03:01.248 --> 01:03:03.691]  They ran off so many other great folks.
[01:03:04.151 --> 01:03:07.314]  To all the other wonderful people out there, you go make your own channels.
[01:03:07.334 --> 01:03:08.355]  You've got video talent.
[01:03:08.695 --> 01:03:10.817]  You go out there and put out whatever you think is important.
[01:03:11.238 --> 01:03:14.181]  Don't let them silence the fight against the New World Order.
[01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:16.783]  We're talking to John Watkins, an amazing individual.
[01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:19.806]  Final segment with him and a challenge he's got for you.
[01:03:20.106 --> 01:03:20.607]  Stay with us.

[01:04:24.202 --> 01:04:26.324]  A new world order.
[01:04:27.025 --> 01:04:31.749]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:04:31.929 --> 01:04:34.711]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:37.013]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:04:37.534 --> 01:04:39.936]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:40.689 --> 01:04:48.026]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:51.064 --> 01:04:56.007]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:56.488 --> 01:04:59.970]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.073]  Most people have no idea.
[01:05:04.093 --> 01:05:04.853]  They're not after money.
[01:05:04.873 --> 01:05:05.954]  They have all the money they need.
[01:05:06.154 --> 01:05:06.875]  They're after power.
[01:05:07.135 --> 01:05:08.256]  That's what they're after these years.

[01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:31.048]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:31.648 --> 01:06:34.631]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:40.350]  Newspapers are declaring and filing for bankruptcy all over the United States.
[01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:41.650]  New York Times is broke.
[01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:44.832]  Headline, mortgages, their headquarters and cash crunch.
[01:06:45.592 --> 01:06:46.592]  They're going to strike back.
[01:06:47.473 --> 01:06:55.456]  Obama's new Internet czar is going to restrict free speech and set up Internet 2, where you have a sub-domain, just like NeffRespect has with YouTube, so they can shut him down.
[01:06:56.076 --> 01:06:58.737]  I would have a huge YouTube, but I don't have the money for people.
[01:06:59.878 --> 01:07:04.460]  I mean, I'm spending twenty grand a month right now on bandwidth, just with PrisonPlanet.tv and my websites.
[01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:08.223]  So you have to understand that this is how they're going to do it.
[01:07:08.843 --> 01:07:14.008]  The future web, you're going to have all your data on a separate server that they're going to control what you have access to.
[01:07:14.028 --> 01:07:15.869]  Now, with respect, you're a great interviewer.
[01:07:15.889 --> 01:07:25.878]  Let me set you up for like a full hour sometime next week to talk about your great films, who you are, getting other people involved, the big event you're having December 19th.
[01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:31.145]  That said, I just want to commend you and thank you for all you've done.
[01:07:31.165 --> 01:07:32.086]  You're another testament.
[01:07:32.106 --> 01:07:41.595]  I mean, today we've talked about retraining Americans how to shoot the history of the founding fathers, then don't drink the aspartame, how it's deadly, now we're fighting against censorship.
[01:07:41.936 --> 01:07:43.938]  I mean, the example of everybody I've had on the day
[01:07:44.678 --> 01:07:53.921]  And you've reached more than anybody in just two years on the web, reaching tens of millions conservatively with just the, you know, one or two, three videos a month that you make.
[01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:59.283]  I salute you, and you are the model of the type of person that's going to turn this world around.
[01:08:00.463 --> 01:08:01.024]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:08:01.124 --> 01:08:03.384]  I mean, that's really nice of you to say that.
[01:08:04.005 --> 01:08:04.965]  I mean, it's thanks to you.
[01:08:05.285 --> 01:08:09.086]  You know, if it wasn't for you, there would be no Neprospect channel on YouTube.
[01:08:09.146 --> 01:08:11.687]  It's because of you that I got into doing all this.
[01:08:11.707 --> 01:08:13.768]  Because when she, as I say, when she realized
[01:08:14.352 --> 01:08:17.453]  You know, the manipulation that's taking place, you know, in this world.
[01:08:17.473 --> 01:08:23.656]  The one thing you want to do is inform other people, and that's all I'm trying to do on YouTube, is just try and wake people up, basically.
[01:08:24.076 --> 01:08:28.398]  You know, and YouTube is thwarting my efforts every step of the way, you know?
[01:08:28.878 --> 01:08:40.403]  So many different methods of censorship, and they're all really crude and sneaky, and it kind of upsets me, because it's not just me it's happening to, it's so many people on YouTube who are just trying to do the same as what I'm doing.
[01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:43.899]  You know, and they make it really hard for us.
[01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:47.540]  You know, there's just so many different ways that they're doing this now.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.541]  You know, and some are more blatant than others.
[01:08:49.621 --> 01:08:56.864]  But, you know, I've seen it enough times to know, you know, I mean, some things you could just brush off as software error, for example.
[01:08:56.924 --> 01:09:01.885]  But, you know, some of the things I've seen, you know, it is definite censorship.
[01:09:01.905 --> 01:09:04.206]  There's no other way to describe it, really.
[01:09:04.226 --> 01:09:06.447]  I mean, another method they use to
[01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:07.792]  I think so.
[01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:29.391]  And then when you try and snap up another channel, nobody really knows for sure whether it's you or not.
[01:09:29.411 --> 01:09:29.672]  That's right.
[01:09:29.692 --> 01:09:35.073]  So we need to create a... Doppelgangers, you need to create... When they used to hack my websites, that's why I have so many.
[01:09:35.334 --> 01:09:39.415]  You just create more and promote them all, and let people know you're under attack.
[01:09:39.455 --> 01:09:45.337]  In the minute and a half we've got left, and I'm going to say to you... I'm going to say bye to you at the end of the show here, privately, so don't hang up.
[01:09:46.698 --> 01:09:50.399]  Tell us what's coming up the 19th, the challenge video you've got up there right now.
[01:09:51.138 --> 01:10:04.785]  Oh yeah, well that's from a user on YouTube called Legitimacy Coalition, and basically he's organizing this thing where what we want to do is get everybody to basically boycott YouTube on December the 19th.
[01:10:05.506 --> 01:10:10.688]  Just not log in to YouTube at all, not use it in any way, shape or form for that date.
[01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:14.690]  And hopefully if enough of us do that, it'll have an impact.
[01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:17.492]  You know, we've got to make our voices heard in some way.
[01:10:18.328 --> 01:10:24.870]  You know, these are the things we're going to have to do now to try and get YouTube to sort of... And we have to boycott it to save it!
[01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:26.370]  And again, why are we there?
[01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:29.971]  Because it's the biggest place where we can virally reach the people.
[01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:35.913]  John Watkins, we'll talk to you and the maker of that channel coming up next week for a full hour if you can do it.
[01:10:36.393 --> 01:10:36.833]  Stay there.
[01:10:36.853 --> 01:10:37.413]  No problem.
[01:10:38.354 --> 01:10:39.254]  It's been great having you on.
[01:10:40.114 --> 01:10:40.635]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:10:40.735 --> 01:10:41.355]  Thanks very much.
[01:10:41.475 --> 01:10:41.776]  You bet.
[01:10:41.796 --> 01:10:42.076]  Stay there.
[01:10:42.116 --> 01:10:43.557]  I'm going to say bye to you when the show ends.
[01:10:44.318 --> 01:10:46.100]  Folks, I had Paul Watson on.
[01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.041]  I had Betty Martini.
[01:10:47.461 --> 01:10:48.962]  I had the guest on about the militias.
[01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:51.265]  And, of course, I had enough respect on.
[01:10:51.645 --> 01:10:55.869]  Be sure and listen to the retransmission now on the internet at infowars.com.
[01:10:56.249 --> 01:10:57.490]  They're not censoring us yet.
[01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:58.471]  They sure are trying.
[01:10:58.792 --> 01:11:00.273]  Spread the word about the free podcast.
[01:11:00.293 --> 01:11:00.994]  God bless you all.
