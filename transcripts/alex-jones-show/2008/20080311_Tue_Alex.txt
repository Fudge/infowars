[00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:09.828]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:11.288]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:12.949]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:17.310]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.872]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:36.138]  My friends, we are live!
[00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.199]  Another live edition.
[00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:42.100]  It is Tuesday, the 11th day of March, 2008.
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.082]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:52.625]  The whole Elliot Spitzer prostitute story broke yesterday, and I never really even got into it.
[00:00:53.165 --> 00:01:01.168]  But we will today, not just covering the facts that there's sex, power, celebrity, all of that is part of the course.
[00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:14.063]  But the fact that he was Mr. Anti-Corruption, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes, when in truth, Eliot Spencer was hooked in with the underworld, with the Giuliani Mafia.
[00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:17.784]  Giuliani is the representation of the Italian mob in New York.
[00:01:18.465 --> 00:01:21.706]  His brother's father and uncle were capos and did time in prison.
[00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:30.269]  Just like Giuliani's chief of staff, who, Bernard Couric, who was going to be the head of Homeland Security, turned out was an arch-criminal.
[00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.909]  Of course they are.
[00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:39.960]  And Elliot Spitzer, their governor, is now in all of this trouble for visiting the Emperor's Club.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.221]  $5,000 a pop.
[00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.824]  Highest quality prostitutes out there.
[00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:48.765]  The creme de la creme.
[00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.366]  The cream of the cream.
[00:01:51.487 --> 00:01:54.089]  And the issue here isn't just the prostitutes.
[00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:59.555]  I mean, at least it's not underage boys like Barney Frank, who was allowed to.
[00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:03.539]  He just said, I'll blow the whistle on who uses them, and the cops all dropped it.
[00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:05.501]  They said, well, run rape rooms, you know.
[00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:11.287]  That's Spitzer's problem, is it wasn't children.
[00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:15.571]  If it was, and that's what the big boys are really into, he would have been left alone.
[00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:18.694]  It was full-grown women, and that just can't be allowed.
[00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:36.484]  I'm being serious here, but the larger issue is they have been blackmailing him, controlling him forever, and I would imagine as governor he got a little bit too big for his britches and really thought that he was the boss, and they are bringing him down to size right now.
[00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:40.386]  Night after night.
[00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:41.948]  It was only a two-month investigation.
[00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:46.651]  Reportedly, he was at the Emperor's Club multiple times weekly with the $5,000-an-hour hookers.
[00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:56.693]  And I bet if you look into this, and it's probably going to come out unless they shut the case down, he's not paying $5,000 two or three nights a week to be with the prostitutes.
[00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:04.659]  It's being comped because he was, quote, a VIP at the Hy-Dollar Whorehouse, an escort service.
[00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.723]  And you better believe these were political favors.
[00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:13.426]  Why do you think the director of the CIA had to step down?
[00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.350]  What, just about eight, nine months ago?
[00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.772]  Why did he have to step down?
[00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:38.587]  He had to step down because he was at the big hotel, Watergate Hotel, where so much has happened in our history, where on one floor they got poker, and then you go to the next floor and it's your selection of $3,000 an hour pokers.
[00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:48.768]  And these are the cream of the Midwest, California, girls that go searching their dreams.
[00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.269]  It's the girl next door.
[00:03:50.690 --> 00:04:00.579]  They are as ubiquitous as water filters in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and especially Washington, D.C.
[00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:05.143]  Some of you out there listening, since your great-looking, smart daughter off to D.C.
[00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.364]  I think she's a photographer.
[00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.202]  Or you think she's, uh, boy, she's driving that swanky car and the rest of it?
[00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:13.264]  No, your daughter is a whore.
[00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:17.027]  And they're there to serve the New World Order, just remember that.
[00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:23.692]  But be glad they weren't grabbed as a CPS child from Florida at age two and flown into Saudi Arabia!
[00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.115]  Or out of Eastern Europe by DynCorp who operates publicly.
[00:04:28.135 --> 00:04:29.416]  You know, at least it was their choice.
[00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.738]  So that's why you're gonna hear about this.
[00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:33.259]  You're not gonna hear about DynCorp and
[00:04:34.011 --> 00:04:39.935]  Airfields every night with thousands of children crying, being loaded on transports, being shipped to slave pits.
[00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:41.436]  Literally.
[00:04:42.557 --> 00:04:43.517]  You're not going to hear about that.
[00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:47.160]  You're going to hear about Elliot Spitzer and his fall.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.242]  A bunch of other news on the currency.
[00:04:50.302 --> 00:04:51.322]  Big guest today.
[00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:52.763]  It's massive.
[00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:53.784]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:04:53.804 --> 00:04:55.165]  It is a big idea
[00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:06.998]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:05:07.878 --> 00:05:10.461]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:12.723]  It's known as the Bilderberg Movement.
[00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:16.066]  Does their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:18.969]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:27.215]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.097 --> 00:05:35.062]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.562 --> 00:05:39.003]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.423 --> 00:05:41.943]  Bill Burgess makes great progress in the New World Order.
[00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:43.144]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.164 --> 00:05:43.924]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.004]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:45.944]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.184 --> 00:05:47.464]  That's what they're after usually.
[00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:55.546]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:58.847]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:58.867 --> 00:05:59.987]  You have been warned.
[00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.833]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:09.177]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:06:09.517 --> 00:06:14.821]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:16.362]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:25.588]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:06:26.028 --> 00:06:27.630]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.035]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:11.036]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:11.456 --> 00:07:18.324]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:25.450]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.391]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:30.874]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:33.596]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[00:07:47.846 --> 00:07:49.847]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:07:49.887 --> 00:07:53.129]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:22.381]  The nation's cable companies are shutting down AXS TV facilities on almost a daily basis.
[00:08:23.362 --> 00:08:25.883]  Hundreds and hundreds every few months are being shut down.
[00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:32.186]  We have fought for many years for the birthplace of AXS television here in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:39.650]  And now Time Warner has won a key court case and is preparing to shut down Austin AXS TV.
[00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.092]  Just a few years ago we had to stop the takeover of AXS television.
[00:08:44.836 --> 00:08:53.359]  Internally with people that wanted to turn it over and we had to end up getting dirt on the director and sending him to prison to Huntsville for stealing $344,000.
[00:08:53.719 --> 00:08:58.980]  John Villarreal.
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.221]  The newspaper still called me a conspiracy terrorist.
[00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:08.543]  The Chronicle did concerning corruption there even after he went to prison and was found guilty by a jury.
[00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:19.033]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, and then by the end of it he finally admitted up to what he had done, but still it doesn't exist even when we're sending him to prison.
[00:09:19.814 --> 00:09:36.105]  Kind of like when I tell you that the Republican Party, to get into the club, you have to be involved in money laundering, drug dealing, prostitutes, you name it, and generally even things worse to move up to a higher level, and now look what we see with Eliot Spencer.
[00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:39.388]  I could take one look at that snake and tell you he was a crook.
[00:09:40.729 --> 00:09:40.829]  One
[00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:46.663]  Look at him and tell you that he's involved in all sorts of things.
[00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:50.145]  And I'm not even talking about the prostitutes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:51.886]  I mean, that guy is involved.
[00:09:52.286 --> 00:09:54.307]  He's best buddies with Larry Silverstein.
[00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:57.348]  Enough said right there.
[00:09:58.329 --> 00:10:04.191]  Best buddies with Larry Silverstein and Giuliani and that whole gaggle.
[00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:09.754]  And this is meant to scare everybody back into line in the New York crime capital.
[00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:12.212]  The real capital of this country.
[00:10:12.232 --> 00:10:16.434]  And to let them know that it doesn't matter how big you are, we'll knock you down.
[00:10:16.874 --> 00:10:19.475]  Republicans set deadline for governor's ousting.
[00:10:20.096 --> 00:10:21.516]  I've asked him to resign.
[00:10:21.757 --> 00:10:28.540]  CBS News, if Governor Eliot Spencer opts to roll the dice and not resign, state Republican leadership will force him to go.
[00:10:30.564 --> 00:10:38.006]  All in and call for his impeachment from office according to state assemblyman who admitted he asked the governor to step down.
[00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:51.430]  Sources told CBS 2 shortly after it was reported that the governor was linked with a prostitution ring that he would likely hand in his resignation which could happen within the next 36 hours.
[00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.871]  One way or another the clock is ticking on Spitzer's next move.
[00:10:57.311 --> 00:10:58.932]  Don't forget the Republican senator
[00:10:59.654 --> 00:11:03.455]  In the bathroom, and he said he was going to resign and he didn't resign.
[00:11:07.176 --> 00:11:10.397]  So look for some sort of trickery along those lines.
[00:11:10.817 --> 00:11:14.719]  What's worse, trying to pick people up in a bathroom?
[00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:17.479]  Or $5,000 an hour prostitutes?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.701]  And again, the prostitution issue is a side issue.
[00:11:25.149 --> 00:11:31.893]  Because if you look into it, you're going to guaranteed find that this was being comped, that it's some sort of payoff.
[00:11:34.395 --> 00:11:35.615]  That's one of their favorite systems.
[00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:41.679]  And the New York City police have run prostitution and drugs for at least a hundred years.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:51.865]  And for those that don't know history, in the 60s and 70s and 80s, they had purges where more than two-thirds, in some cases, of the detectives would have to be fired.
[00:11:53.223 --> 00:12:03.466]  I know for Sally Soccer Mom and Joe Sixpack, you don't believe the government's involved in anything corrupt, and that's because you've been living with your head buried in the ground for your entire life.
[00:12:03.526 --> 00:12:08.948]  But I assure you that it's worse than you can even possibly fathom.
[00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:20.792]  And the fact that Eliot Spencer had petitions brought to him, the fact that people reached out to him,
[00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:36.389]  When he was the supposed, you know, king of anti-corruption in New York, in his regulatory position, previous to being governor, and that he helped cover up the dust, that he helped cover up the bombs in the buildings, that when the victims' families came to him, he always blocked it.
[00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:41.132]  We have had protests to Eliot Spitzer's office in New York, what, two 9-11s ago, in 2006.
[00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:43.454]  It was the fifth anniversary.
[00:12:51.081 --> 00:12:54.622]  We marched to his office, to Silverstein's office, to other people's offices.
[00:12:54.642 --> 00:13:00.965]  You know, we need to get Luke Radowsky to pop in for maybe 10 minutes today to give us his take on this.
[00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:10.029]  In fact, maybe we should just try to get Luke on before this hour ends after Lyndon Lutowski's on about the free speech attack against AXS TV.
[00:13:10.329 --> 00:13:12.470]  She's coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:20.193]  Then we've got Paul the Redcoat Watson, our great reporter and researcher and the head of PrisonPlanet.com, the editor over there.
[00:13:22.114 --> 00:13:34.201]  Watson is going to be joining us to talk about a host of issues, including, but not limited to, Army recruits 180 foreign officers to fill its staff post.
[00:13:34.241 --> 00:13:36.682]  That's right, commanded by foreigners.
[00:13:36.722 --> 00:13:38.003]  Gotta love that, just like our military.
[00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:42.526]  A new proposal to fight global warming within civilization, kill billions.
[00:13:43.106 --> 00:13:44.827]  Get into Paul's story there.
[00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:47.789]  Also, China's one-child policy to stay in place.
[00:13:47.809 --> 00:13:49.530]  We'll be talking about the whole eugenics agenda.
[00:13:50.282 --> 00:14:01.508]  And of course, foreign troops, including Ukrainian troops, who've been doing practice martial law takeover drills for years in England, they're under the same system that we're under here.
[00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:16.416]  But they're going to have Eastern Europeans ruling them, and we're going to have Latin Americans ruling us in the new power structure, as well as a gaggle of Canadians down here, and they'll have a gaggle of Americanos up there on their backs.
[00:14:18.206 --> 00:14:21.527]  But, uh, I'm not going to talk much more about the Spitzer situation.
[00:14:21.587 --> 00:14:22.787]  Paul's into a story on it.
[00:14:26.628 --> 00:14:33.109]  He made a lot of enemies, uh, posing as an anti-corruption guy, but when you really looked at it at the end of the day, he was there covering up a lot.
[00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:35.850]  Kind of like Senator, uh, Kerry.
[00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.811]  John Kerry is, he'll have an investigation about the POWs, but at the end he'll just cover it all up.
[00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:43.731]  But he'll give some nice flowery speeches.
[00:14:44.631 --> 00:14:47.692]  Same thing, uh, that so many of these other guys do.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.741]  And of course, Spitzer is coming out.
[00:14:51.781 --> 00:15:00.446]  The FBI's got recordings of him calling the whorehouse, going to the whorehouse, the whole nine yards.
[00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.148]  And I would imagine it is quite a temptation.
[00:15:04.168 --> 00:15:13.973]  You know, the cream of our young women now, the main profession, and I've seen the numbers, is prostitution.
[00:15:15.034 --> 00:15:16.514]  Our country has certainly changed.
[00:15:17.575 --> 00:15:19.476]  And imagine all that money and power and
[00:15:21.027 --> 00:15:27.290]  For years, you know, Mr. Anti-Corruption, uh, wallowing, uh, with the prostitutes on a daily basis.
[00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:34.953]  You see, when the media tells you somebody is anti-corrupt, they're corrupt.
[00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:49.740]  They're always going, John McCain, the name when it comes to anti-corruption and the most upstanding values, a person of the highest integrity, and you actually study him, Mob Connections, Keating 5, Scams,
[00:15:50.546 --> 00:15:57.571]  Just every form of wicked behavior when it comes to politics, and so the media says he's anti-corrupt.
[00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:16.404]  That's because they can destroy him anytime they want, just like Barack Obama's got so many skeletons, so much corruption, so many things in his background, that anytime they want to just destroy him overnight, they can do it.
[00:16:18.145 --> 00:16:19.806]  Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton,
[00:16:20.502 --> 00:16:22.583]  Anytime they want to destroy them, they can.
[00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:32.249]  They wanted to destroy Ron Paul, they did a decent job of it, but they had to dig up 15 and 20 year old newsletters and then misconstrue even what they said.
[00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:38.953]  But it still had some effect on the lemming population.
[00:16:39.633 --> 00:16:46.737]  The lemming population needs to understand that generally if somebody's being attacked, it means they didn't play ball.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:17:02.383]  And who knows, maybe Mr. Spitzer wasn't as corrupt as they'd like him to be, but he had a weakness for beautiful women, and so now they're going to use that against him.
[00:17:03.963 --> 00:17:14.645]  You know, as for me, I attempt to be a moral person, but I don't sit up here on a moral high horse, and I don't generally make so-called moral issues
[00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:41.719]  That is, the petty moral issues, the political football issues, whoring over like so many phony pastors and people are doing on radio right now, Elliot Spitzer and the things that he has admittedly done, but they never talk about the true perversion and true evil.
[00:17:45.208 --> 00:18:04.241]  Going out and imbibing in prostitutes is not a good or healthy thing, but certainly compared to the White House instructing the military to use pliers on children sexually, that is light years in a different universe of corruption and evil compared to prostitutes.
[00:18:06.122 --> 00:18:09.164]  That is just a completely different realm.
[00:18:09.184 --> 00:18:12.547]  Oh, but the neocons on talk radio defend that.
[00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:27.158]  I mean, to me, two guys in an ultimate fighting contest beating each other half to death and people routinely dying in these different types of martial art gladiatorial events are becoming popular.
[00:18:27.718 --> 00:18:33.742]  To me, that is more obscene than someone going out and having sex.
[00:18:39.506 --> 00:18:42.528]  Again, I'm just trying to put this into perspective.
[00:18:45.015 --> 00:18:58.341]  You don't see our news picking up the fact that DynCorp and Halliburton run giant sex slavery kidnapping rings of children as young as a year and a half, up to women, 25.
[00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:07.405]  But the larger portion of their operation is literally taking Iraqis, Central Europeans, Eastern Europeans,
[00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:34.667]  And flying them to third world nations in Asia, island nations, and literally chaining them to sewing machines, most of them, or shipping them to huge brick manufacturing factories where they work 14 hours a day and sleep in huge dormitories on tiny bunks, and are actual prisoners for their entire lives.
[00:19:35.428 --> 00:19:36.768]  Oh, that's in the mainstream news!
[00:19:38.442 --> 00:19:42.266]  Chicago Tribune, BBC, but it never becomes a big issue.
[00:19:44.307 --> 00:19:44.888]  So let me see.
[00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:49.632]  Loading people on C-130s to take them to slave factories?
[00:19:50.513 --> 00:19:51.894]  Actual slave factories?
[00:19:52.214 --> 00:19:53.616]  I mean real live slave factories.
[00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:58.440]  Or is it having sex with a porn star?
[00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:04.778]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.398 --> 00:20:14.322]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.802 --> 00:20:21.965]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:28.191]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.691 --> 00:20:39.502]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.263 --> 00:20:42.325]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:44.367]  For more information, call 702-953-ZX.
[00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:55.336]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:55.757 --> 00:20:58.298]  A new world order.
[00:20:58.478 --> 00:21:07.161]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of governments.
[00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:12.843]  It's known as the Builderbirds.
[00:21:13.904 --> 00:21:16.165]  Both their objective being world domination.
[00:21:16.705 --> 00:21:19.106]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:27.180]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.202 --> 00:21:35.223]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.483 --> 00:21:39.144]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.524 --> 00:21:42.045]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:21:42.085 --> 00:21:43.245]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.265 --> 00:21:44.025]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.045 --> 00:21:45.106]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:46.066]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.286 --> 00:21:47.126]  That's what they're after.
[00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:52.007]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:00.110]  You have been warned.
[00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:03.091]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:08.433]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:09.954]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:22:10.214 --> 00:22:18.377]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:22:18.618 --> 00:22:24.320]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.281]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:22:26.341 --> 00:22:28.481]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:22:28.641 --> 00:22:32.903]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:22:33.063 --> 00:22:35.203]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:22:35.283 --> 00:22:43.166]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:22:43.166 --> 00:22:43.646]  We're good.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:13.614]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:23:14.015 --> 00:23:20.762]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:23:21.122 --> 00:23:24.704]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:23:25.064 --> 00:23:28.266]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:23:28.486 --> 00:23:30.207]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:23:30.247 --> 00:23:35.990]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:23:41.793 --> 00:23:49.958]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and
[00:23:52.284 --> 00:23:53.785]  On a lonely, lonesome highway East of Omaha
[00:24:28.447 --> 00:24:33.328]  Elliot Spitzer had to fall because the New World Order gives you snacks.
[00:24:33.949 --> 00:24:36.349]  The illusion that they're fighting corruption.
[00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:49.553]  But if you start seeing Dine Corps executives arrested for running giant kidnapping rings, slave rings, then you'll know something's really happening.
[00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:51.186]  But don't hold your breath.
[00:24:51.226 --> 00:24:52.548]  He's only with us about four minutes.
[00:24:52.608 --> 00:24:54.570]  I wanted to get Luke Rudowsky and We Are Change on.
[00:24:55.832 --> 00:24:57.174]  Karl Rove has been confronted.
[00:24:57.314 --> 00:24:58.335]  We've got a newscast.
[00:24:58.455 --> 00:24:59.517]  Play it later in the next hour.
[00:24:59.577 --> 00:25:06.085]  Bill Clinton confronted in Louisiana by 9-11 Truth slash We Are Change folks.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.620]  It's really starting to shake them up.
[00:25:08.741 --> 00:25:12.401]  Over 1,000 people out of a crowd of 5,000 confronted Karl Rove.
[00:25:12.421 --> 00:25:13.522]  The police could do nothing.
[00:25:13.882 --> 00:25:15.262]  It took over the entire event.
[00:25:15.802 --> 00:25:20.584]  Everywhere these crooks go, doesn't matter if it's Democrats, Republicans, the people are standing up, getting in their face.
[00:25:21.364 --> 00:25:26.445]  Look, the revolution is, in the Info War, is taking the high ground from these people.
[00:25:26.465 --> 00:25:29.086]  They can't go anywhere now without being exposed.
[00:25:29.733 --> 00:25:30.974]  The tide is turning.
[00:25:31.015 --> 00:25:32.236]  The time is right now.
[00:25:32.356 --> 00:25:33.677]  We're making headwaves.
[00:25:33.717 --> 00:25:34.819]  We're creating some noise.
[00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:39.644]  I also just wanted to add that our new chapter in Mississippi also just confronted Bill Clinton.
[00:25:39.664 --> 00:25:44.049]  That video up is on wearechange.org and people can go see it right now.
[00:25:44.634 --> 00:25:47.576]  So it's happening in Mississippi, Louisiana, Ohio.
[00:25:48.117 --> 00:25:51.379]  I mean, again, they need to go have these staged events with crowds.
[00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:52.540]  They're panicking.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.440]  There's nothing they can do.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.363]  This is the beginning of the people taking action against them in the Infowar.
[00:25:57.383 --> 00:25:58.764]  Okay, shifting gears.
[00:25:58.784 --> 00:26:02.126]  We're going to play that audio next hour, and I appreciate you bringing that up, Luke.
[00:26:03.267 --> 00:26:03.647]  No problem.
[00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:14.317]  In 2006 to his office, he was in the position, you know, then of supposedly overseeing and trying to fight corruption.
[00:26:14.677 --> 00:26:15.678]  Now he's the governor.
[00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:17.660]  We knew he was buddies with Silverstein.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.801]  We knew he was a rat then.
[00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:20.523]  He's blocked 9-11 investigations.
[00:26:20.943 --> 00:26:25.247]  Now they're destroying him with the high-class hooker story.
[00:26:25.487 --> 00:26:26.228]  Your take on that?
[00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:28.113]  I mean, this is pretty interesting.
[00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:30.675]  I know Larry Silverstein and Spitzer are very close.
[00:26:31.115 --> 00:26:39.921]  When we started doing street actions outside Building 7, Larry Silverstein actually moved his weekly meetings to Spitzer's office, right where we were protesting.
[00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:49.347]  And, you know, within the years living in New York City, we've given many petitions to Mr. Spitzer to investigate 9-11, and he has ignored those petitions.
[00:26:49.727 --> 00:26:53.910]  And to me, it's a very interesting spin to see him go down for this prostitution ring.
[00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.732]  Let's see what comes out of it, but it's pretty interesting, to say the least.
[00:26:58.715 --> 00:27:10.543]  Well, if he was just visiting with the prostitutes, that's one thing he'll get out of it, but if Wything's correct comes out, he's not paying for these, and he's being given treats for not busting it.
[00:27:11.003 --> 00:27:16.927]  Yeah, he was caught on a federal wiretap, I mean, and he's getting cash wired to him from all these different bank accounts.
[00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.609]  Who knows what's really going on?
[00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:20.550]  I just hope the truth of the story really comes out.
[00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.053]  Who knows what the mainstream media is spinning all the time, but who knows what this really is.
[00:27:27.182 --> 00:27:36.387]  By the way, you know that famous footage that's in the new film we're making of where the guys come over to say, we're cops, you're not allowed to protest in front of Larry Silverstein's even on a public sidewalk.
[00:27:36.647 --> 00:27:38.788]  Then they say, you've got bombs, we're going to frame you.
[00:27:39.188 --> 00:27:44.330]  I mean, those are like guys out of Central Mafia casting from Goodfellas or The Sopranos.
[00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:50.293]  That's the type of folks that you see around Spitzer and that you see around Silverstein.
[00:27:50.313 --> 00:27:51.654]  We know they're two peas in a pod.
[00:27:52.034 --> 00:27:55.496]  I wonder what the chances are that old Larry's tied into all this.
[00:27:56.432 --> 00:27:57.714]  It really wouldn't surprise me.
[00:27:57.774 --> 00:27:58.654]  I hear many rumors.
[00:27:58.715 --> 00:28:04.780]  People always take me to the side when I'm out here in New York City and tell me a lot of interesting things about Larry Silverstein.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.182]  You know, one of which is also including prostitution.
[00:28:07.683 --> 00:28:08.564]  And, uh, I don't know.
[00:28:08.784 --> 00:28:10.005]  I can't confirm these sources.
[00:28:10.045 --> 00:28:11.727]  These people will come to me always scared.
[00:28:11.747 --> 00:28:12.868]  They don't want to come forward.
[00:28:13.048 --> 00:28:13.869]  And the M.O.
[00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.070]  is smack, yeah.
[00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:17.009]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:28:17.069 --> 00:28:18.630]  Smack Lord since the 60s.
[00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.130]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:24.231]  Thank you so much for saying that, because I had so many people just come up to me, take me to the side, say we have to talk.
[00:28:24.611 --> 00:28:27.652]  We walk, and we walk, and they tell me these crazy, outrageous stories.
[00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:31.533]  And then when I ask them to come forward, they never do, because they're scared, and they don't.
[00:28:31.893 --> 00:28:41.356]  Because, of course, there's mafia ties, and that pretty much shows you when we were outside building seven, these guys are straight-up mafia-type, straight-up, you know, they're nothing else.
[00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:54.701]  And also one thing I wanted to add, that guy who said that I had a backpack explosives on me, I had a backpack bomb on me, he was actually fired, but then shortly afterwards I found out he was rehired again, just for the PR stunt of it.
[00:28:57.043 --> 00:28:57.924]  It's amazing, Luke.
[00:28:57.964 --> 00:28:59.105]  WeAreChange.org.
[00:28:59.165 --> 00:29:00.426]  How many chapters now?
[00:29:00.746 --> 00:29:02.168]  They're proliferating everywhere.
[00:29:02.628 --> 00:29:03.289]  They're everywhere.
[00:29:03.329 --> 00:29:05.010]  We're also starting a chapter in France.
[00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.432]  I can't even keep track.
[00:29:07.256 --> 00:29:07.616]  Good job, Luke.
[00:29:07.636 --> 00:29:08.877]  Thanks for your take on Spitzer.
[00:29:36.762 --> 00:29:37.622]  Thanks for having me.
[00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:38.083]  You bet.
[00:29:38.403 --> 00:29:41.844]  Yeah, the FBI though wouldn't be bringing him down if big boys hadn't said do it.
[00:29:41.884 --> 00:29:43.684]  So, this is no victory.
[00:29:44.184 --> 00:29:44.884]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.806 --> 00:29:52.746]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:54.807]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:58.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.625 --> 00:30:01.965]  I think so.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.741]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:30:24.062 --> 00:30:30.064]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:30:30.284 --> 00:30:33.825]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:30:34.065 --> 00:30:38.607]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:30:38.887 --> 00:30:39.667]  Do your part!
[00:30:39.948 --> 00:30:42.208]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:30:42.569 --> 00:30:48.691]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:30:48.991 --> 00:30:51.395]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[00:30:51.776 --> 00:30:57.966]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now, by going directly to alkavision.com.
[00:30:58.247 --> 00:30:59.649]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:31:01.101 --> 00:31:01.761]  It's a fact.
[00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:09.442]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:31:09.583 --> 00:31:18.444]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:31:18.704 --> 00:31:29.246]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:31:29.526 --> 00:31:35.570]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:40.813]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:31:40.993 --> 00:31:45.496]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:47.477]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:31:47.497 --> 00:31:47.757]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:31:47.777 --> 00:31:48.317]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:31:48.398 --> 00:31:50.179]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:31:57.483 --> 00:31:58.224]  Is that right?
[00:32:13.763 --> 00:32:14.083]  I don't know.
[00:32:31.937 --> 00:32:32.537]  We're good.
[00:33:07.014 --> 00:33:13.139]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:21.866]  This is the end, my only friend.
[00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:28.051]  The end, of all the elaborate plans.
[00:33:28.211 --> 00:33:34.096]  The end, of everything that stands.
[00:33:34.216 --> 00:33:34.756]  The end,
[00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:51.129]  That's right, it's the end for Elliot Spitzer.
[00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.091]  No more grandstanding.
[00:33:55.592 --> 00:33:59.916]  Posing as a good guy, as Mr. Anti-Goody-Two-Shoes Corruption.
[00:33:59.956 --> 00:34:01.257]  Now he's tied in with a mob.
[00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:05.640]  Cash payments, wired money back and forth between him and the whorehouse.
[00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:07.562]  For protection, no doubt.
[00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:12.567]  And it's also the end for the neocons.
[00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:14.950]  They're being exposed globally for everything they're doing.
[00:34:15.811 --> 00:34:19.155]  Coming up next hour, Paul Watson joins us with the real globalist agenda.
[00:34:19.616 --> 00:34:24.161]  Queen says rich nations need to sacrifice the name of climate change with global taxes.
[00:34:24.181 --> 00:34:26.745]  We're going to be breaking this down in detail.
[00:34:27.702 --> 00:34:35.347]  Then joining us from Spain, he's about to come to the United States, best-selling author Daniel Estelin, for a full hour, because there's been so many new big developments.
[00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:42.411]  He'll be popping in and joining us, talking about the latest operations of the Globalist.
[00:34:43.492 --> 00:34:47.214]  It is the 11th day of March, 2008.
[00:34:49.235 --> 00:34:55.219]  Okay, three or four years ago, Tom Warner, here in Austin, tried to shut down Access Television.
[00:34:55.834 --> 00:35:02.960]  And it doesn't matter where you live, New York, California, Tennessee, Mississippi, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.843]  The big cable companies are shutting access down everywhere.
[00:35:06.883 --> 00:35:13.768]  They went to the feds, they got them to change the regulations, where they can still pretty much have monopolies in your city.
[00:35:14.568 --> 00:35:18.591]  But in the past, the cities would say, okay, but you've got to provide an access TV channel.
[00:35:18.751 --> 00:35:20.973]  And some of them are just a closet and a camera, and that's fine.
[00:35:21.413 --> 00:35:24.335]  Where you can go rant in a soapbox, there should be bare minimum that.
[00:35:24.675 --> 00:35:25.616]  And others are really nice.
[00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.817]  And the birthplace of access TV is Austin, Texas.
[00:35:29.078 --> 00:35:31.420]  So please pay attention, because this affects everybody.
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.382]  Even if you don't have cable, don't watch access television.
[00:35:35.279 --> 00:35:39.741]  The birthplace of access television was Austin, Texas, 34, almost 35 years ago.
[00:35:40.281 --> 00:35:42.082]  They took that model 30 years ago.
[00:35:42.162 --> 00:35:48.665]  Congress did something good and said, we need the people to have some of the transmission lines, some of the basic airwaves.
[00:35:49.986 --> 00:35:52.067]  Technically, it's not in the air, but you catch my drift.
[00:35:53.007 --> 00:36:02.271]  And here, you can see the county, the city, and AISD, three channels there, and then three channels out of one building for citizens to go down and do shows.
[00:36:02.291 --> 00:36:03.492]  And that's where I started out 13 years ago.
[00:36:06.284 --> 00:36:17.495]  And a couple years ago, we caught the director trying to turn it over and make it go, quote, private, basically give some of the channels over to a private group, tied him with Time Warner.
[00:36:18.316 --> 00:36:23.080]  We began investigating him, put a PI on him, hired somebody else to do research.
[00:36:24.001 --> 00:36:28.025]  I mean, we recorded phone calls, went to meetings, recorded them, did all kinds of stuff.
[00:36:28.365 --> 00:36:31.008]  We know it went higher than them, but he went to jail
[00:36:31.914 --> 00:36:35.958]  The city killed the investigation after the director because it went into the city and the rest of it.
[00:36:37.019 --> 00:36:39.642]  And some people on some boards, but that's another issue.
[00:36:39.662 --> 00:36:43.005]  The point is the director went to prison for stealing $347,000.
[00:36:43.045 --> 00:36:43.325]  Was it $344,000?
[00:36:43.365 --> 00:36:43.325]  $346,000?
[00:36:43.645 --> 00:36:49.231]  So, when we tell you something's going on, it's going on.
[00:36:49.271 --> 00:36:53.735]  Now, they always deny anything's happening when we say something's happening.
[00:36:54.156 --> 00:36:55.417]  That's a tactic they use.
[00:36:56.678 --> 00:36:57.718]  That you're well aware of.
[00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:59.499]  They just deny the existence of it.
[00:36:59.579 --> 00:37:06.022]  But Time Warner, in a consortium with the Texas Cable Consortium of Companies, has gone.
[00:37:06.062 --> 00:37:09.684]  They've won the right to sue to shut access down in Austin.
[00:37:09.744 --> 00:37:17.367]  Now, they did this in San Antonio, and seven days after, padlocked the doors, wouldn't even let producers get their tapes, and destroyed it.
[00:37:17.447 --> 00:37:17.927]  Shut it down.
[00:37:17.967 --> 00:37:19.288]  They're shutting it down everywhere.
[00:37:20.542 --> 00:37:24.186]  And I have been so busy that I hadn't even paid attention that this was going on.
[00:37:24.226 --> 00:37:25.147]  I learned of it last night.
[00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:26.448]  Saw the documents.
[00:37:27.629 --> 00:37:30.291]  There's a meeting at the Austin City Council tomorrow.
[00:37:32.293 --> 00:37:35.476]  And I am just asking all of you, the listeners, to call the Austin City Council.
[00:37:35.496 --> 00:37:36.657]  We're going to give you their number in a minute.
[00:37:36.698 --> 00:37:37.238]  Be polite.
[00:37:37.658 --> 00:37:39.700]  But tell them that you want Access TV.
[00:37:40.281 --> 00:37:41.222]  The big issues are
[00:37:42.182 --> 00:37:47.003]  Satellite doesn't have the local channels where you can watch the city, the county, the school.
[00:37:47.584 --> 00:37:51.425]  It doesn't have a place for handicapped folks to be able to get down and see the city council.
[00:37:51.725 --> 00:37:52.485]  They're watching it.
[00:37:53.045 --> 00:37:53.805]  It's free speech.
[00:37:53.905 --> 00:37:54.806]  It's the birthplace.
[00:37:56.906 --> 00:38:03.008]  Tom Warner, no tax money goes to this, about between 18 and 30-something cents, depending on how much you pay.
[00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:06.613]  When your cable bill goes for six channels.
[00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:09.114]  The city meetings, the county meetings, all of it.
[00:38:09.355 --> 00:38:10.655]  The city and the county don't want this.
[00:38:10.695 --> 00:38:11.216]  They don't like it.
[00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:12.136]  They don't like being watched.
[00:38:12.417 --> 00:38:15.298]  They don't like your citizens' communication when you get up to speak being seen.
[00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:20.782]  So the issues we're talking about, you can duplicate in your area if they haven't already shut down your facility.
[00:38:20.802 --> 00:38:23.744]  They've shut down more than half the access facility just in the last five years.
[00:38:23.824 --> 00:38:24.885]  We are under attack.
[00:38:25.865 --> 00:38:28.187]  We have fought hard for this institution.
[00:38:29.027 --> 00:38:31.589]  And it's something of the people, for the people, by the people.
[00:38:31.629 --> 00:38:33.130]  We've got good directors in there now.
[00:38:34.106 --> 00:38:37.987]  Linda Letowski and Gary and others that are down there, they're good First Amendment folks.
[00:38:38.527 --> 00:38:41.308]  We ran the other people to ground, ran them out of there.
[00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:44.469]  They tried to take us over from within before.
[00:38:45.049 --> 00:38:49.890]  But bottom line, the city needs to know this is a big issue.
[00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.050]  And I want to bring Linda Letowski up.
[00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.151]  Linda, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:38:53.651 --> 00:38:54.371]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:38:55.671 --> 00:38:59.032]  For some reason, Murphy's Law, your phone didn't have a hum earlier, it's got one now.
[00:38:59.841 --> 00:39:00.441]  It just started.
[00:39:00.461 --> 00:39:02.142]  It's at Grande Communications.
[00:39:03.622 --> 00:39:04.562]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:06.003]  Hey, that's okay, Linda.
[00:39:06.203 --> 00:39:10.424]  Just in a nutshell, tell us what we're facing, what's going to happen at this meeting tomorrow.
[00:39:11.324 --> 00:39:13.764]  Tomorrow it's at the Telecommunications Commission.
[00:39:13.824 --> 00:39:20.186]  It's in the Boards and Commissions Room at City Hall, across the aisle from the City Council Chambers.
[00:39:20.946 --> 00:39:28.108]  What the Telecommunications Commission has asked is for a public forum on public access today and in the future.
[00:39:28.804 --> 00:39:34.447]  And we are trying to get all the folks down there to let them know what they feel the value of public access is.
[00:39:34.847 --> 00:39:44.151]  Not only the producers who have their First Amendment right to free speech, to have their programs on the air, but also the viewers or any other community supporters.
[00:39:45.248 --> 00:39:55.055]  Millions of dollars over the years, the paltry quarter or so a month out of our bills, has gone to build this and was the model for the nation.
[00:39:55.716 --> 00:40:06.884]  I think the angle of not just free speech, but that this is an institution, this is the birthplace of access television, and also the fact that they've held back your money now for two years.
[00:40:07.684 --> 00:40:08.485]  Well, that's true.
[00:40:08.505 --> 00:40:11.287]  There is a division here.
[00:40:11.347 --> 00:40:13.108]  With the new laws that were passed in 2005,
[00:40:15.255 --> 00:40:23.023]  Any cable company can go to a statewide video permit once it completes its franchise or contract with the city.
[00:40:23.643 --> 00:40:27.527]  The problem with that is that all operating funds will go away.
[00:40:28.007 --> 00:40:35.594]  There will be money for capital equipment funds, but not for operations, and that's where we're in real big trouble.
[00:40:38.453 --> 00:40:40.854]  Now, Linda, again, break this down.
[00:40:40.894 --> 00:40:46.195]  They've also held back some of the money from the bills for the last year or so.
[00:40:46.575 --> 00:40:49.656]  Will we get that money if they're able to successfully shut us down?
[00:40:50.737 --> 00:40:51.477]  No, we won't.
[00:40:51.577 --> 00:40:59.559]  Actually, Time Warner Cable owes the city approximately $1.8 million in capital equipment funds.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.661]  This year we saw just under $200,000 and that's still being held.
[00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:11.784]  So if any money is left on the table, Time Warner sees to get out of their franchise agreement, that money will disappear.
[00:41:12.986 --> 00:41:15.992]  Linda, before we get back into Axios Television, is there anybody else on the phone line?
[00:41:16.644 --> 00:41:17.504]  No, there's not.
[00:41:17.624 --> 00:41:19.244]  I'm on line one and no.
[00:41:19.545 --> 00:41:20.625]  Okay, well, whatever.
[00:41:20.665 --> 00:41:21.605]  We'll just deal with the hum.
[00:41:22.205 --> 00:41:22.865]  I'm sorry.
[00:41:23.285 --> 00:41:23.825]  Hey, it's okay.
[00:41:23.845 --> 00:41:24.305]  It doesn't matter.
[00:41:24.665 --> 00:41:26.606]  Listen, folks, this is so important.
[00:41:27.226 --> 00:41:28.546]  They're going to shut it down.
[00:41:28.906 --> 00:41:32.907]  Let's look at the Time Warner model just a year or so ago in San Antonio.
[00:41:33.227 --> 00:41:37.147]  What did they do there when they were able to withdraw from the contract?
[00:41:37.448 --> 00:41:44.409]  Well, actually, their contract ended with Time Warner in the city of San Antonio December 31st, 2005.
[00:41:46.468 --> 00:41:50.772]  They immediately went, Time Warner, to a state video permit.
[00:41:51.152 --> 00:41:53.315]  They locked the doors of the studio.
[00:41:53.895 --> 00:41:57.258]  Public access producers videotapes were inside.
[00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:58.720]  They did not return them.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:11.732]  They took the channel black, and it actually stayed dark until July of 2006, when the channel went back up on the air with limited programming and very little, if any, equipment.
[00:42:12.361 --> 00:42:16.945]  Yeah, that's the slow-kill process that they're using there.
[00:42:17.345 --> 00:42:19.807]  I mean, what are your ideas of ways to put pressure?
[00:42:19.827 --> 00:42:21.629]  Because all we have is the political will now.
[00:42:22.169 --> 00:42:30.817]  Congress has pulled out and said, well, you can basically have oligopolies or monopolies and have all the city roads to lay your cable, but that's of no value now.
[00:42:30.857 --> 00:42:37.983]  You don't even have to give 25 cents out of a $50 bill to provide the citizens with access to their government and free speech.
[00:42:38.562 --> 00:42:40.923]  That's correct, and we're seeing this all over the country.
[00:42:41.343 --> 00:42:49.547]  Unfortunately, Texas led the charge, and it was primarily AT&T and Verizon, the large telcos, that brought this about.
[00:42:50.007 --> 00:43:03.033]  So what we have now is, after 35 years of amazing, an amazing resource for all citizens of our community, that will most likely go away due to any lack of funds.
[00:43:03.633 --> 00:43:07.095]  And you're right, political will, we're there now.
[00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:22.579]  We need to move in the direction of letting all of our elected officials know how valuable that this incredible resource is to the citizens of Austin, Texas and looking out across the whole nation.
[00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:26.021]  Tampa, their public access is being shut down.
[00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:30.022]  The public access there has chosen to sue their city council.
[00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:31.863]  It happened in San Antonio.
[00:43:31.883 --> 00:43:34.785]  It happened in Missouri, Ohio, Michigan.
[00:43:35.185 --> 00:43:37.966]  It's like a house of cards that's falling.
[00:43:38.974 --> 00:43:44.319]  And the birthplace, in fact, we've won more awards here in Austin than any other access facility in the nation.
[00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:52.626]  We really are seen as the progenitor, as the Moses on the mountain, and they are really watching what's happening here very, very closely.
[00:43:52.646 --> 00:44:01.314]  35 years, 34 plus years, just absolutely amazing what we're facing here, and
[00:44:03.434 --> 00:44:10.557]  So many times when a police officer shoots somebody in the back, it's AXS TV that produces the protest that ends up getting the cop fired.
[00:44:10.977 --> 00:44:15.998]  Or so many times when they're engaged in a land theft from some farmer, it's AXS TV that stops it.
[00:44:16.519 --> 00:44:25.442]  Or so many times when they were taking old people's homes for three-inch grass under zoning, saying they hadn't mowed their yard, $2,000 a day fines, we would shame them and stop it.
[00:44:25.962 --> 00:44:28.263]  Hundreds and hundreds of things we've been able to do.
[00:44:29.043 --> 00:44:30.523]  The legislature's based here.
[00:44:30.543 --> 00:44:31.984]  We've been able to galvanize support.
[00:44:32.484 --> 00:44:43.809]  There are more than 20 patriot-type programs on there, from Fighting the Toll Roads, Supporting Ron Paul, to Second Amendment, and to immigration groups that fight for our sovereignty.
[00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:48.071]  I mean, there is so much programming here that would make my listeners happy.
[00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:49.112]  There's a lot of other programming.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:50.620]  We're good to go.
[00:45:09.534 --> 00:45:10.835]  It was in surrounding cities.
[00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:12.476]  They've been shutting off our channels there.
[00:45:12.856 --> 00:45:18.419]  So we've seen an attack and a paring back of Austin Access Television, now known as PACT.
[00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:20.800]  And I want to give some phone numbers out.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:26.003]  Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow night, City Council, downtown Austin.
[00:45:26.063 --> 00:45:28.444]  You cannot miss it.
[00:45:29.245 --> 00:45:31.486]  City Hall, 301 West 2nd Street, 2nd floor.
[00:45:34.651 --> 00:45:39.854]  And this is going to be in room 1101 in the telecommunications room.
[00:45:39.894 --> 00:45:41.415]  It's a big room, a whole lot of people.
[00:45:41.775 --> 00:45:47.218]  Get there about 7 o'clock to sign up to speak and let them know that you're not going to put up with it.
[00:45:47.298 --> 00:45:51.580]  Also, call Time Warner, call others, tell them you're going to dump your cable.
[00:45:52.341 --> 00:45:55.743]  Besides, why would you even have cable if it wasn't for local programming and access?
[00:45:56.983 --> 00:46:14.973]  Ten years ago, fifteen years ago, when they were getting telecommunications bills, fifteen and then ten, two different events, there's twelve now, they would go to Congress and brag about access TV and local programming and why that was better than satellite, and they would advertise that it's something unique.
[00:46:15.633 --> 00:46:17.974]  And Time Warner should do that, but they're not.
[00:46:18.034 --> 00:46:19.374]  They want to get rid of that free speech.
[00:46:19.394 --> 00:46:20.495]  They want that monopoly.
[00:46:20.815 --> 00:46:22.976]  Both the newspapers attack Access TV.
[00:46:23.276 --> 00:46:25.136]  They're jealous of not having a monopoly.
[00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:33.999]  These mainline media whores do not like the fact that the people in Austin and other areas around the country aren't just at their will.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.360]  You've got a very good point there, Alex.
[00:46:37.541 --> 00:46:38.421]  All of that is true.
[00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:44.743]  Plus, we're looking at a political landscape across the country that is trying to shut down independent
[00:46:45.274 --> 00:46:46.535]  Non-commercial media.
[00:46:46.975 --> 00:46:50.076]  And that's another issue that's on the table as well.
[00:47:04.143 --> 00:47:08.845]  In a month, it's about 50 views on their video and then that's scattered around the world.
[00:47:09.345 --> 00:47:18.949]  Access, you can have tens of thousands in a city like Austin, see your TV show, get big rallies going, have political change, it's focused in the area you're in.
[00:47:19.509 --> 00:47:22.552]  It's much bigger than the internet in the localized area.
[00:47:22.852 --> 00:47:25.994]  You need that for political free speech and advocacy.
[00:47:26.375 --> 00:47:28.256]  It has been such a tool against tyranny.
[00:47:28.676 --> 00:47:30.838]  Austin's the fastest growing city in Texas.
[00:47:31.238 --> 00:47:33.680]  It's the wealthiest city now per capita in Texas.
[00:47:34.041 --> 00:47:35.502]  One of the most wealthy in the nation.
[00:47:35.962 --> 00:47:37.463]  So much corruption is going on.
[00:47:37.784 --> 00:47:41.106]  Land grabs, toll roads, Sentra, Bilderberg activity.
[00:47:41.527 --> 00:47:45.310]  We need this venue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:46.351]  This is so important.
[00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:46.771]  So listen.
[00:47:47.978 --> 00:47:51.722]  Tomorrow night, 7 o'clock, be down there, sign up to speak.
[00:47:52.804 --> 00:47:56.208]  It is absolutely imperative that everybody be down there.
[00:47:56.228 --> 00:48:00.032]  Austin City Council, Mayor Will Nguyen.
[00:48:00.072 --> 00:48:01.073]  Give him a call at 512-974-2250.
[00:48:01.093 --> 00:48:02.655]  512-974-2250 and let him know.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:18.090]  That we want to access TV and we don't want him to sell out to the corporate interest and that there's going to be very serious political repercussions, lawsuits, you name it.
[00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:20.652]  If this continues, they can bet on it.
[00:48:21.213 --> 00:48:22.294]  Let's expand on that.
[00:48:22.334 --> 00:48:23.395]  Here's the general number.
[00:48:23.956 --> 00:48:28.261]  Call, ask for the Telecommunications Board, ask for their number, ask for their extension.
[00:48:29.022 --> 00:48:30.083]  This is the switchboard.
[00:48:30.643 --> 00:48:32.224]  Ask for other City Council members.
[00:48:32.244 --> 00:48:32.704]  512-974-2000.
[00:48:32.724 --> 00:48:32.764]  512-974-2000.
[00:48:32.784 --> 00:48:32.824]  512-974-2000.
[00:48:32.864 --> 00:48:36.686]  And I want to see you up there tomorrow night in room 1101 of the City Council building.
[00:48:36.706 --> 00:48:37.267]  You need to be there.
[00:48:37.327 --> 00:48:39.048]  Linda, in closing, give out the PACT website.
[00:48:39.148 --> 00:48:40.168]  You know, tell them about...
[00:48:59.018 --> 00:49:02.942]  And thank you so much, Alex.
[00:49:03.202 --> 00:49:03.483]  You bet.
[00:49:03.503 --> 00:49:04.464]  Give that address out again.
[00:49:04.504 --> 00:49:07.046]  That's P-A-C-T Austin dot org.
[00:49:07.427 --> 00:49:08.067]  That's correct.
[00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:12.352]  Now, Linda, I just want to make it clear for people.
[00:49:13.113 --> 00:49:14.534]  This is a do or die, Alex.
[00:49:14.895 --> 00:49:15.916]  This is a do or die.
[00:49:17.657 --> 00:49:20.861]  Here's the timeline in other cities in Texas with the model they're using.
[00:49:21.855 --> 00:49:26.518]  They have to sue to get the right to sue to pull out of the franchise and get out of their contract.
[00:49:26.558 --> 00:49:28.559]  They will assuredly win that, probably.
[00:49:28.579 --> 00:49:31.561]  We need to put pressure there as well, but they've got a good chance of winning.
[00:49:32.081 --> 00:49:35.663]  And then they could try to shut you down within a matter of weeks.
[00:49:35.783 --> 00:49:37.965]  So, we're talking about a few months here, Linda.
[00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:39.125]  That's correct.
[00:49:40.186 --> 00:49:45.589]  If they sue to get out of their franchise agreement, then there would be no more operating funds.
[00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.631]  And there's no doubt they have sued to be able to sue.
[00:49:49.358 --> 00:49:50.099]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:49:50.139 --> 00:49:54.362]  And they did win in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
[00:49:55.963 --> 00:50:01.828]  In these dark times for this country and the world, do we need more free speech in the few venues we've got or do we need less, Linda?
[00:50:02.409 --> 00:50:04.750]  We need absolutely more free speech.
[00:50:05.431 --> 00:50:09.274]  We need it to be free and independent of any controls.
[00:50:10.195 --> 00:50:11.896]  And that's what access is all about.
[00:50:12.016 --> 00:50:13.938]  Why has Time Warner suddenly put a delay in?
[00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.572]  See that's something that we've gone to them to ask them.
[00:50:18.612 --> 00:50:21.293]  They had a delay and it affects our live shows.
[00:50:22.174 --> 00:50:23.394]  So we don't understand.
[00:50:23.434 --> 00:50:25.475]  We heard that there was some work at the head end.
[00:50:25.855 --> 00:50:27.776]  That's another thing that we need to look into.
[00:50:27.796 --> 00:50:31.438]  And they've been screwing up the channels and everything else.
[00:50:31.458 --> 00:50:40.363]  There's been some audio difficulties specifically and we have been off the air due to power outages recently.
[00:50:41.161 --> 00:50:42.382]  A lot of chicanery.
[00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:45.744]  Linda Lachowski, I'll see you down there tomorrow night.
[00:50:45.804 --> 00:50:47.886]  We salute you for defending the First Amendment.
[00:50:48.186 --> 00:50:48.866]  God be with us.
[00:50:48.886 --> 00:50:49.727]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:50:49.987 --> 00:50:50.707]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:50:51.448 --> 00:50:54.930]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with global news, financial news.
[00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:55.951]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.784 --> 00:51:03.465]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:51:03.785 --> 00:51:07.286]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:51:07.406 --> 00:51:09.286]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:09.506 --> 00:51:12.607]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:12.927 --> 00:51:18.429]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:18.709 --> 00:51:22.650]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:27.914]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:51:28.194 --> 00:51:30.996]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:51:31.276 --> 00:51:38.161]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or screened in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[00:51:38.541 --> 00:51:44.385]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:51:44.566 --> 00:51:49.109]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[00:51:49.409 --> 00:51:51.973]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[00:51:52.273 --> 00:51:53.935]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:51:54.356 --> 00:51:56.158]  Burn the info bombs to discs.
[00:51:56.339 --> 00:51:58.161]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:51:58.502 --> 00:51:59.923]  Bring down the New World Order.
[00:52:00.304 --> 00:52:01.125]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:52:02.617 --> 00:52:05.581]  Spyville.com is your choice for everything spy related.
[00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:13.750]  Stealth cameras cleverly disguised as items commonly found around the home, night vision cameras, covert phone and voice recorders, powerful binoculars, security systems and more.
[00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:19.817]  Find hidden cameras wherever you go with a small handheld spy finder and locate hidden transmitters with one of our bug detectors.
[00:52:20.177 --> 00:52:20.898]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.435 --> 00:52:41.335]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:06.792]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:53:07.192 --> 00:53:10.134]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:53:10.434 --> 00:53:12.995]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:53:13.355 --> 00:53:18.177]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:53:18.557 --> 00:53:23.940]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.201]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:53:27.381 --> 00:53:27.962]  We're good to go.
[00:53:43.194 --> 00:53:45.676]  If any man worshipped a beast, take notice.
[00:53:46.016 --> 00:53:47.617]  It says, Worship the Beast.
[00:53:47.917 --> 00:53:50.519]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[00:53:50.799 --> 00:53:56.143]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:53:56.163 --> 00:53:56.363]  That's 1-888-211-17...
[00:54:19.345 --> 00:54:23.247]  Confronted in Mississippi.
[00:54:23.267 --> 00:54:28.449]  We've got reports of him being confronted in other states as well in the last few days.
[00:54:28.509 --> 00:54:28.929]  Here it is.
[00:54:30.919 --> 00:54:32.679]  They still rank among the greats.
[00:54:32.859 --> 00:54:33.980]  We have the best economy.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:37.380]  The United States is in the best condition it could be in when he was in office.
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:41.121]  I went to the inauguration and I climbed a fence to get in to see him.
[00:54:41.221 --> 00:54:43.762]  And I knew it froze to death up there in Washington.
[00:54:44.122 --> 00:54:46.702]  But wherever Bill Clinton is, I want to be there.
[00:54:46.742 --> 00:54:48.643]  He's the best president we've ever had.
[00:54:48.783 --> 00:54:53.504]  And it's no doubt they see Bill and Hillary Clinton as the perfect package deal to lead America.
[00:54:53.604 --> 00:54:55.964]  And everyone knows the husbands in Washington
[00:54:55.984 --> 00:54:56.785]  We're good to go.
[00:55:11.237 --> 00:55:13.038]  Alright, let's hear the actual confrontation.
[00:55:13.058 --> 00:55:15.720]  Cue it up right to where the We Are Change Mississippi, and I salute them.
[00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:16.441]  Confront his lordship.
[00:55:37.016 --> 00:55:39.957]  Tell us the truth about Donald Trump!
[00:55:40.097 --> 00:55:42.238]  Tell us the truth about Donald Trump!
[00:55:42.258 --> 00:55:44.839]  Why did he create Dr. A. Robinson in 1996?
[00:55:44.899 --> 00:55:48.861]  Well, let me explain something to you.
[00:55:48.921 --> 00:55:51.202]  This is not an inside job interview.
[00:55:51.302 --> 00:55:53.803]  It's not an inside job interview.
[00:55:53.823 --> 00:55:57.784]  My team members saw it and they didn't think it was worthwhile to see it.
[00:55:57.804 --> 00:55:58.365]  So... Thank you.
[00:56:05.368 --> 00:56:28.395]  We stood on that road cross, stood in the land, looking at people and pictures of their loved ones.
[00:56:29.523 --> 00:56:38.052]  Alright, now let's go to Karl Rove being confronted in Ohio, but this time it was by more than one-fifth of the 5,000 strong crowd, and there was nothing they could do.
[00:56:38.392 --> 00:56:42.056]  Citizens then tried to do a citizen's arrest on him and got arrested themselves.
[00:56:42.377 --> 00:56:45.540]  The point is, wherever these criminals go, they're being confronted with the truth.
[00:56:47.562 --> 00:56:51.767]  They were going to be the last defense between Southern Community Air Force One and Air Force One.
[00:56:53.523 --> 00:56:54.384]  We're good to go.
[00:57:10.365 --> 00:57:21.915]  Now, it's widely accepted and known that the White House did have a hand in oversight of the commission, and there were certain commissioners who were privy to only a minority of the documents and intelligence available.
[00:57:22.515 --> 00:57:25.118]  Now, knowing that... Alright, that's good.
[00:57:25.378 --> 00:57:27.259]  That's last week's rogue being confronted.
[00:57:27.279 --> 00:57:28.781]  I guess we haven't sent you the new one.
[00:57:29.341 --> 00:57:30.122]  That's the problem.
[00:57:30.142 --> 00:57:33.705]  There's so much, ladies and gentlemen, we can't even keep track of this anymore.
[00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:40.773]  Wherever they go, wherever they do, Republicans, Democrats, they're being confronted on 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:57:41.653 --> 00:57:55.361]  And whereas a lot of the crowd will hoop and holler and cheer Clinton when he says, how dare you, large portions are agreeing and even pulling people off the 9-11 truthers when other people start grabbing them, pushing them, shoving them, grabbing their signs.
[00:57:56.142 --> 00:57:59.984]  That happened with Barack Obama here in Austin, happened with Bill Clinton just a week and a half ago.
[00:58:01.185 --> 00:58:01.785]  Same M.O.
[00:58:03.138 --> 00:58:13.487]  Again, they can't go have their fake town halls, they can't have their staged little theatrical patty cake events, because the people are there bringing real issues to the fore.
[00:58:14.107 --> 00:58:14.848]  And it's not going to stop.
[00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:16.049]  It's not just going to be 9-11 truth.
[00:58:16.089 --> 00:58:17.129]  It's the war.
[00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:17.950]  It's everything.
[00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:19.972]  The people are getting out in the streets.
[00:58:20.292 --> 00:58:22.954]  The people aren't just demonstrating and having the news ignore them.
[00:58:22.974 --> 00:58:24.556]  They're going to these staged events.
[00:58:24.996 --> 00:58:26.737]  They are injecting truth into them.
[00:58:26.977 --> 00:58:28.759]  They are making news every time.
[00:58:30.848 --> 00:58:32.711]  This has really got the establishment scared.
[00:58:32.731 --> 00:58:36.756]  That's why they're calling for us to be put in, quote, secret prisons and tortured.
[00:58:37.296 --> 00:58:38.878]  Because they're absolute criminals.
[00:58:42.903 --> 00:58:44.025]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.085 --> 00:58:46.528]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.984 --> 00:59:02.165]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.825 --> 00:59:03.645]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.405 --> 00:59:05.306]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.966 --> 00:59:09.726]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.147 --> 00:59:14.227]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.804 --> 00:59:29.825]  Paul Watson is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment of The Balance of the Hour.
[00:59:29.845 --> 00:59:45.708]  Talk about the Chinese one-child policy to stay in place, how that ties into the larger eugenics program, how that ties into the Queen of England calling for a global tax on the middle class to, quote, save the earth, a tax that will go directly to her and her degenerate scum-filled family.
[00:59:46.448 --> 00:59:49.089]  Also, Professor, big money behind global warming
[00:59:49.833 --> 00:59:50.614]  Propaganda.
[00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:56.597]  We're going to get into that report that Paul Watson has put out as well today.
[00:59:56.617 --> 01:00:09.766]  Another report he put out yesterday is very, very important and gets into Carnegie Endowment documents that are being adopted where they admit what we're saying.
[01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:13.328]  That this is a total control grid over all human activity.
[01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:14.569]  Again, carbon.
[01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:15.610]  Carbon dioxide is what
[01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:18.853]  Animals, mammals, insects exhale.
[01:00:19.133 --> 01:00:19.994]  But plants breathe.
[01:00:20.354 --> 01:00:27.440]  By saying that's a toxic, deadly waste, which of course it's not, then they get to tax and micromanage all life activities.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.303]  Meanwhile, they come and say, we're taking all restrictions off coal-burning plants.
[01:00:31.724 --> 01:00:34.326]  You can burn dirty coal full of mercury all over the country.
[01:00:34.826 --> 01:00:38.430]  And then they don't tell the public about it or have mercury action days.
[01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:40.992]  No, they have ozone and carbon dioxide action days.
[01:00:42.737 --> 01:00:43.758]  Very, very sinister.
[01:00:43.798 --> 01:00:44.899]  Very, very disgusting.
[01:00:45.419 --> 01:00:49.762]  New proposals to fight global warming would kill civilization, kill billions.
[01:00:49.822 --> 01:00:55.406]  We'll be going over those reports here as well.
[01:00:55.426 --> 01:01:02.672]  Another big report, Drugs in Water Report, promotes nationwide alarm.
[01:01:04.344 --> 01:01:08.365]  Drugs and Water Report promotes nationwide alarm.
[01:01:08.985 --> 01:01:11.506]  Now, this came out Sunday, but we've added to it.
[01:01:11.546 --> 01:01:21.088]  Paul Watson's on another story, breaking down the fact that even this report's a whitewash because they don't talk about the level of drugs when they're added all together.
[01:01:21.108 --> 01:01:31.591]  And then when you add all the thousands of chemicals that are in every major supply together, we're talking about 5, 10, 15, 20, sometimes even higher parts per million.
[01:01:32.011 --> 01:01:32.571]  Massive!
[01:01:33.713 --> 01:01:34.294]  Massive!
[01:01:34.454 --> 01:01:42.362]  I mean, one part per million of fluoride is enough to... And by the way, people are saying, what do you mean you're saying 20 IQ point reduction?
[01:01:42.382 --> 01:01:43.604]  Where's your facts on that?
[01:01:44.124 --> 01:01:47.808]  You know, IQ is measured by your test scores.
[01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:55.957]  Yes, the medical reports, the medical studies, going back to the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, right through now, all of them admit
[01:01:56.511 --> 01:02:02.212]  That you get between a 10 and 20 percent IQ reduction from the intelligence that you would have had.
[01:02:02.512 --> 01:02:07.533]  They've even done this in groups where one town is Florida and the other town isn't for average test scores.
[01:02:07.673 --> 01:02:11.334]  It is bang on that it attacks the brain.
[01:02:11.874 --> 01:02:13.574]  It eats holes in your brain.
[01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:19.435]  So we'll be going over that as well today.
[01:02:20.735 --> 01:02:23.916]  Before I go any further and come back in the next segment,
[01:02:26.852 --> 01:02:39.597]  We are going to tell you a little bit about Freedom Law School, and it is going to be coming to the 2008 Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference.
[01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:47.941]  LiveFreeNow.org, and that's going to be the 28th to the 31st in Irvine, California.
[01:02:47.961 --> 01:02:49.301]  These sell out most of the time.
[01:02:49.722 --> 01:02:52.843]  Amazing speakers like William Rodriguez, Jason Berman, Shea Edward Griffin,
[01:02:54.767 --> 01:03:00.369]  Dave von Kleis, Paymon, Tommy Cryer, Joe Bannister, Larry B. Crabb, Michael Collins, Piper, and many more.
[01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:02.671]  It's a three-day event.

[01:03:25.464 --> 01:03:33.311]  All right, we'll come back, plunge into all this news and a lot more today, right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.

[01:05:02.216 --> 01:05:03.456]  The Late Great USA.
[01:05:03.716 --> 01:05:05.117]  America, Freedom to Fascism.

[01:05:51.804 --> 01:05:54.945]  Are you concerned about cholesterol?
[01:05:55.165 --> 01:05:55.825]  Blood pressure?
[01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:57.745]  Are you experiencing chest pain?
[01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:02.247]  Are you looking for a more natural method to help improve your health issues?
[01:06:02.747 --> 01:06:05.728]  My husband has had lots of blood pressure problems.
[01:06:05.968 --> 01:06:08.149]  It would just be really high.
[01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:12.470]  The doctor would work with him and give him some medication for a little while.
[01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.851]  It would maybe work and then it wouldn't.
[01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:18.612]  He was going back and forth and my husband's not the type
[01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:19.350]  I think so.
[01:06:33.536 --> 01:06:36.837]  And as long as he's been on these, it has literally saved his life.

[01:06:50.003 --> 01:06:58.407]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.727 --> 01:07:01.028]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:04.102 --> 01:07:20.336]  Drugs and Water Report prompts nationwide alarm.
[01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:25.800]  Hearing set for April as consumers react with shock.
[01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:29.183]  Full scale of crisis not realized.
[01:07:31.039 --> 01:07:47.977]  A study conducted by the Associated Press which found that numerous pharmaceutical drugs have contaminated the water supplies of millions of Americans has provoked nationwide alarm, causing consumers and experts alike to react with shock.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.223]  But the true scale of the problem may not have fully been realized.
[01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:54.824]  There's no may about it.
[01:07:55.424 --> 01:08:16.458]  A five-month Associated Press investigation has determined that trace amounts of many pharmaceuticals we take to stay healthy, listen to that spin from the AP, like Prozac and Ritalin, this is so sick, are seeping into water supplies and a growing body of research indicates this could harm humans, states the report.
[01:08:17.947 --> 01:08:26.092]  At least 13 different medications from antidepressants like Prozac to six hormones have been discovered in drinking water of 41 million Americans.
[01:08:26.892 --> 01:08:34.177]  A number likely to be far higher considering the fact that all water districts were not tested and some went to great lengths to keep their results secret.
[01:08:34.217 --> 01:08:42.442]  Yeah, in the report most of them are secret and I would add that they would just say other drugs and wouldn't say what they were.
[01:08:43.883 --> 01:08:57.068]  Consumers nationwide reacted with shock to the reports without realizing that they were already being mass medicated against their will in many water districts by way of sodium fluoride being added to the water supplies without their consent.
[01:08:58.048 --> 01:09:08.372]  New revelations of pharmaceuticals in water will only increase pressure on water districts to remove sodium fluoride or potentially, on the flip side,
[01:09:10.632 --> 01:09:14.874]  Accelerate a drive to add it before consumers have a chance to say no.
[01:09:15.474 --> 01:09:34.363]  This is all the more prescient considering the fact that recent Scientific American report concluded that scientific attitudes towards fluoridation may be starting to shift as new evidence emerges on the poisons linked to disorders affecting teeth, bones, the brain, and the thyroid gland, as well as lowering IQ.
[01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.925]  And then they link to a study that says 20 points.
[01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:38.870]  That's where I got that.
[01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:44.432]  Then I say that in a YouTube video, and people freak out and say I'm a liar, and there's 2,000 comments debating it.
[01:09:44.632 --> 01:09:46.393]  Just go to the source documents, dummies!
[01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.633]  This is serious, okay?
[01:09:48.674 --> 01:09:50.854]  Stop being... Stop acting like you're dumb.
[01:09:51.154 --> 01:09:54.695]  I don't mean our listeners, but those out there in YouTube land and the rest of it.
[01:09:54.715 --> 01:09:55.516]  This is serious!
[01:09:57.136 --> 01:09:58.897]  The Philadelphia Water Department was...
[01:10:00.276 --> 01:10:11.541]  Flooded with calls from alarmed residents despite officials denying there was any risk after the Associated Press revealed that traces of 56 pharmaceuticals or byproducts had been found in the city drinking water.
[01:10:11.862 --> 01:10:12.782]  Yeah, it's hundreds.
[01:10:12.802 --> 01:10:14.663]  It's 56 in that one water supply.
[01:10:15.323 --> 01:10:23.747]  New York City lawmakers were similarly disturbed by the new evidence, promoting questions as to why the program was not divulged to the public earlier.
[01:10:23.987 --> 01:10:24.367]  Wait a minute.
[01:10:26.068 --> 01:10:29.590]  For as long as I've been doing talk radio, there's AP reports every year about the drugs in the water.
[01:10:30.379 --> 01:10:33.181]  This is just not getting attention because the web is spreading it now.
[01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:36.983]  Because, see, the AP used to report on this, but it would never get in the papers.
[01:10:38.244 --> 01:10:40.806]  Remember, ten years ago on the Newswire, you'd see this stuff every year.
[01:10:41.606 --> 01:10:42.707]  This is very alarming.
[01:10:42.767 --> 01:10:50.172]  We need to add to this story about all the frogs and fish that are becoming sterile, or both sexes, because of it, showing it's at high levels.
[01:10:50.472 --> 01:10:51.293]  This is very alarming.
[01:10:51.333 --> 01:10:57.437]  A member of the City Council's Committee on Environmental Protection, Peter Vallone of Queens, said rather than sitting back and
[01:10:58.084 --> 01:11:00.686]  In being informed about this, New York City should have been proactive.
[01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:04.209]  I would hope we institute some sort of testing as soon as possible.
[01:11:05.329 --> 01:11:20.521]  New York environmental organization Riverkeeper described the report as a wake-up call and demanded the government immediately conduct a federally funded national study to provide risk assessments for pharmaceuticals in waters and measure the potential harm to aquatic health effects.
[01:11:20.561 --> 01:11:21.982]  That's already been done.
[01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:24.564]  In Pittsburgh, the story of
[01:11:26.835 --> 01:11:37.860]  Resonated with local experts who are concurrently studying the effects of estrogen contamination is having on fish, where in some cases 85% are found to be genderless.
[01:11:38.621 --> 01:11:37.860]  85%.
[01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.862]  Of course, then your kids are drinking this.
[01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:43.883]  You wonder why your 3-year-old daughter looks like she's 15.
[01:11:44.244 --> 01:11:46.745]  You wonder why your 15-year-old son is a girl.
[01:11:47.905 --> 01:11:49.506]  The plastics, all of it, folks.
[01:11:49.566 --> 01:11:50.927]  The estrogen mimicking chemicals.
[01:11:52.094 --> 01:11:59.417]  Dr. Dan Volz from the University of Pittsburgh says the dumping of cleaning products and cosmetics down drains is contributing to the crisis.
[01:11:59.998 --> 01:12:05.700]  Marion Honorwit, State Director of the Clean Water Action, said, we know that there is a problem in Pittsburgh.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.440]  And it goes on and on.
[01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:12.203]  Now the larger issue here, and Paul gets into that at the end, is chemicals.
[01:12:12.763 --> 01:12:14.544]  We need to integrate that into a bigger article.
[01:12:15.184 --> 01:12:18.626]  Paul, you're only writing three stories a day and web mastering and doing customer service.
[01:12:18.646 --> 01:12:19.106]  It's not enough.
[01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:19.546]  I'm joking.
[01:12:19.566 --> 01:12:20.187]  Paul's incredible.
[01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:28.202]  What we need to point out here is, this is the key, that if you add the parts per billion together, it becomes parts per million.
[01:12:28.523 --> 01:12:44.956]  It's hundreds of drugs, thousands of chemicals, it is a toxic soup, and I heard Dr. Dina Dell, who's on like 500 radio stations, last week saying, conspiracy theorists say the water isn't good, the tap water is the best water in the world, we have the best water, it's totally clean and delicious.
[01:12:46.097 --> 01:12:48.179]  I mean, this is like saying the moon's made out of cheese.
[01:12:49.401 --> 01:12:51.522]  Okay, you must filter your water.
[01:12:52.042 --> 01:12:53.442]  You must filter.
[01:12:53.722 --> 01:12:55.343]  Reverse osmosis gets about 90% out.
[01:12:55.743 --> 01:13:01.445]  Uh, what I do is I feed it through reverse osmosis and then I send it through a big Berkey on top of it.
[01:13:01.985 --> 01:13:03.486]  Because Berkeys get about 95% out.
[01:13:04.286 --> 01:13:07.267]  This stuff is all so powerful, it goes through everything.
[01:13:07.547 --> 01:13:11.908]  You gotta have double PF2 filters added on just to reduce the fluoride down to 99.9%.
[01:13:12.048 --> 01:13:17.090]  Even reverse osmosis can't stop fluoride, it's so small.
[01:13:18.202 --> 01:13:23.243]  I mean, we are... and by the way, if you think that's all, they have been caught adding stuff to the water.
[01:13:23.263 --> 01:13:24.383]  This is not by accident.
[01:13:24.803 --> 01:13:29.844]  I remember a story like eight years ago where they found three or four parts per million of Prozac in the water.
[01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.344]  I want to say it was Dallas.
[01:13:31.364 --> 01:13:33.245]  That's why Dallas didn't allow a study to be done.
[01:13:33.265 --> 01:13:34.405]  I'm going from memory here, but look it up.
[01:13:34.425 --> 01:13:35.165]  You'll find it's accurate.
[01:13:35.465 --> 01:13:36.805]  That's ancient memory, so check it.
[01:13:37.225 --> 01:13:40.986]  But I know that they found... and they said, this can't be urine.
[01:13:41.006 --> 01:13:41.986]  This can't be pills.
[01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:46.267]  This can't be... How are we having three, four, five parts per million Prozac?
[01:13:46.787 --> 01:13:48.128]  Folks, it's being put in the water.
[01:13:48.849 --> 01:13:54.474]  We know in other countries, a few of the Asian countries, they've been caught doing it.
[01:13:54.914 --> 01:13:58.497]  Well, they put sodium fluoride in when they knew in the 20s it was a toxin sedative.
[01:13:59.939 --> 01:14:09.227]  So, Paul Watts has done a great job with this story that gives you a lot bigger picture, not just the... The Austin American Statesman yesterday, I've got to dig that out.
[01:14:09.287 --> 01:14:10.708]  I saw it, never covered it.
[01:14:11.457 --> 01:14:16.399]  ...said that they can't tell you what's in the water because Homeland Security says Al-Qaeda might use that information.
[01:14:16.659 --> 01:14:17.340]  What does that mean?
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:29.225]  The state's been so bad in town, all the other papers would tell you what the AP said, and it was a whitewash itself, and the statesman said, we cannot let you know, and said Al-Qaeda.
[01:14:29.625 --> 01:14:30.966]  I'm not joking.
[01:14:31.006 --> 01:14:33.967]  You can't make stuff like this up.
[01:14:34.881 --> 01:14:47.925]  Okay, now we're going to shift gears into the Chinese one-child policy, into global warming being a hoax for taxation, into their own documents, Carnegie documents and others, admitting what this will do.
[01:14:48.465 --> 01:14:54.467]  Also, because he joins us from England, Army recruits 180 foreign officers to fill staff posts.
[01:14:54.507 --> 01:14:56.748]  Now, we're going to go through all this.
[01:14:57.648 --> 01:15:00.109]  Paul Watson, hadn't had you on in a while, appreciate you coming on.
[01:15:00.849 --> 01:15:01.909]  Good to be here, Alex.
[01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:04.490]  How are things going up in Sheffield?
[01:15:05.698 --> 01:15:07.041]  Uh, pretty good.
[01:15:07.061 --> 01:15:08.543]  I'm still squidding around town.
[01:15:20.091 --> 01:15:22.613]  Well yeah, it's being exposed to an ever greater degree, simply because
[01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:57.932]  The claims that they make about what the supposed effects of global warming are going to be in 20, 30, 50 years, you know, they're getting more and more outrageous that people are beginning to see through it.
[01:15:58.473 --> 01:16:09.975]  I mean, during the last global cooling hoax in the 70s, when they said that we were on the verge of a new ice age, they said that all the fish in the sea would be dead within 20, 30 years.
[01:16:11.531 --> 01:16:17.316]  And those exact same claims are now being repeated with the global warming scam.
[01:16:17.896 --> 01:16:19.777]  So it's the same kind of fear mongering.
[01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:35.810]  And then we had that report yesterday out of the Washington Post from the Carnegie Institute, which basically said that we're going to have to reduce carbon emissions to near zero or absolute zero within decades.
[01:16:36.821 --> 01:16:41.684]  Or they claim the world's oceans and rivers are going to dry up due to global warming.
[01:16:43.405 --> 01:16:59.035]  The fact that this would set technological progress back hundreds of years and effectively, you know, return man to the Stone Age was not even mentioned by the Washington Post, who, you know, gave it sober gravitas.
[01:17:00.841 --> 01:17:02.002]  Now, let's be clear here.
[01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:04.823]  The Carnegie Endowment are the ones that even set up the Rockefellers.
[01:17:05.303 --> 01:17:14.327]  They're the ones, in their Carnegie Endowment for Peace, that call for world war, for world government, that call for eugenics extermination, that pay for PhDs in sterilization.
[01:17:14.608 --> 01:17:16.788]  I mean, these are the in-game monsters.
[01:17:18.069 --> 01:17:18.649]  Exactly.
[01:17:18.829 --> 01:17:21.731]  And it all tracks back to the origins of
[01:17:23.064 --> 01:17:36.483]  When the legitimate concerns about the environment, you know, things like toxic waste dumping, you know, deforestation, were hijacked around the late 80s, early 90s by these same globalist interests.
[01:17:37.044 --> 01:17:38.947]  And in that article that I wrote yesterday,
[01:17:39.725 --> 01:17:43.086]  I include quotes from the Club of Rome.
[01:17:43.427 --> 01:18:03.475]  They did a report in 1991 entitled, The First Global Revolution, and in that report it states, quote, In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like, would fit the bill.
[01:18:03.855 --> 01:18:06.516]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention.
[01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:09.297]  The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.
[01:18:10.066 --> 01:18:19.411]  So there you have the Club of Rome stating on record that they would use global warming as a means of uniting the people behind their agenda.
[01:18:19.931 --> 01:18:21.151]  And what was their agenda?
[01:18:21.872 --> 01:18:28.195]  In the same report it states, quote, State sovereignty must be altered in a globalised era.
[01:18:28.575 --> 01:18:36.259]  A system of world government must be created and sovereignty eliminated in order to fight global warming as well as terrorism.
[01:18:36.299 --> 01:18:38.200]  That was Richard Haass, who is now the
[01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.910]  President of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.951]  And I told you to stay there.
[01:18:42.971 --> 01:18:44.351]  I want to come back and go back over those quotes again.
[01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:47.212]  Understand, it's the twin tracks of terror and carbon.
[01:18:47.572 --> 01:18:50.453]  And that's how they're going to micromanage and carry out the exterminations.
[01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:52.373]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.894 --> 01:18:55.274]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.294 --> 01:18:57.414]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.135 --> 01:19:02.516]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:03.016 --> 01:19:04.776]  It's known as the Builder Earth.
[01:19:04.996 --> 01:19:08.017]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:08.638 --> 01:19:11.080]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:11.801 --> 01:19:19.228]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:27.115]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:27.635 --> 01:19:31.078]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.459 --> 01:19:33.981]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for New World Order.
[01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:35.182]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.202 --> 01:19:35.983]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.003 --> 01:19:37.064]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.264 --> 01:19:38.005]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.245 --> 01:19:39.046]  That's what they're after.

[01:19:47.714 --> 01:19:50.997]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:19:51.017 --> 01:19:52.058]  You have been warned.
[01:19:53.951 --> 01:19:57.334]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:19:57.474 --> 01:20:02.679]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:07.644]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:20:07.924 --> 01:20:19.055]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:20:19.335 --> 01:20:24.899]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:20:25.119 --> 01:20:31.183]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:20:31.384 --> 01:20:32.024]  What about you?
[01:20:32.324 --> 01:20:34.225]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[01:20:52.816 --> 01:21:05.559]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:21:05.979 --> 01:21:12.701]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:21:13.061 --> 01:21:13.381]  I think so.
[01:21:42.841 --> 01:21:43.282]  We're good to go.
[01:21:52.737 --> 01:21:54.598]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:21:54.798 --> 01:21:57.838]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:02.700]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:05.681]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:22:05.941 --> 01:22:10.802]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:22:11.022 --> 01:22:12.803]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:13.003 --> 01:22:18.724]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:22:18.985 --> 01:22:20.685]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:22:21.005 --> 01:22:24.987]  Yes, SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:22:25.427 --> 01:22:36.431]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at the regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[01:22:36.832 --> 01:22:41.894]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:22:42.114 --> 01:22:45.155]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:45.795]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:22:48.036 --> 01:22:51.198]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today.
[01:22:58.384 --> 01:23:08.811]  Alright, let's go right back to Paul Watson with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:23:08.871 --> 01:23:11.393]  Then Daniel Esselstyn pops in on the 3rd with your phone calls.
[01:23:13.453 --> 01:23:21.116]  Paul, I hope listeners realize you have links to the documents, public statements by the people and the foundations that literally set all this up.
[01:23:21.176 --> 01:23:22.497]  They admit it's a fraud.
[01:23:22.977 --> 01:23:24.338]  They admit it's a scam.
[01:23:24.878 --> 01:23:27.159]  They admit it'll kill billions, starve billions.
[01:23:27.619 --> 01:23:29.220]  This is their operation.
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.261]  And there's no doubt about this.
[01:23:32.281 --> 01:23:39.424]  So all the environmentalists need to understand, the GMO and things like that that are real threats to humanity and the environment, that's all going ahead.
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.741]  Carbon dioxide is something that the Earth needs.
[01:23:42.801 --> 01:23:43.562]  Please continue.
[01:23:43.722 --> 01:23:45.903]  Go back to that Haas quote.
[01:23:47.463 --> 01:23:52.526]  Yeah, this is in a Club of Rome report, the first global revolution, 1991.
[01:23:53.106 --> 01:24:07.212]  He stated, quote, state sovereignty must be altered in a globalized era, that a system of world government must be created and sovereignty eliminated in order to fight global warming as well as terrorism.
[01:24:07.825 --> 01:24:15.008]  Moreover, states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies if the international system is to function.
[01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:27.033]  So you have them admitting in their own writings that it was essentially seized upon as a phony crisis for the purposes of crafting their world government system.
[01:24:28.554 --> 01:24:35.477]  I mean, even as recently as last year, March 2007 Trilateral Commission meeting,
[01:24:36.385 --> 01:24:38.346]  We wrote a report about this at the time.
[01:24:39.027 --> 01:24:48.032]  You had Peter Sutherland, the chairman of British Petroleum, an oil company obviously, and the director of N.M.
[01:24:48.112 --> 01:25:03.722]  Rothschild & Sons urging the rest of the elite in the speeches that they gave at that conference to seize upon global warming to institute new worldwide control measures, which again, you know,
[01:25:04.531 --> 01:25:09.795]  Contributes towards the same global government agenda of crafting those worldwide systems of control.
[01:25:09.815 --> 01:25:15.899]  And then they say in summation though in those quotes that it is then to wage war on humanity.
[01:25:16.399 --> 01:25:17.680]  This is neo-feudalism.
[01:25:18.361 --> 01:25:21.183]  Yes, because the first quote was
[01:25:22.532 --> 01:25:32.657]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill.
[01:25:33.157 --> 01:25:36.339]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention.
[01:25:36.519 --> 01:25:39.280]  The real enemy then is humanity itself.
[01:25:40.106 --> 01:25:41.807]  So, divide and conquer again.
[01:26:00.359 --> 01:26:02.261]  Exactly, and the propaganda that's pushing this is so intense.
[01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:43.429]  I don't know how bad it is in America, but in the UK, you watch television, basically every other advert talks about being green, and it's all being used as an advertising ploy.
[01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:53.391]  You've got soap powder ads, you've got laundry powder ads, talking about how turning down your thermostat will help global warming be cured, and it's everywhere.
[01:26:53.851 --> 01:26:55.952]  We have to sit and watch Shell Oil
[01:26:56.966 --> 01:27:01.947]  On a commercial in the UK lecturing us about global warming, Shell Oil!
[01:27:02.427 --> 01:27:04.668]  So I mean, don't people see something wrong here?
[01:27:04.728 --> 01:27:17.631]  If, you know, they tell us that carbon controls are going to stop the dirty oil men from polluting the planet and making vast profits, then, you know, why are those same oil men promoting the global warming propaganda?
[01:27:17.751 --> 01:27:21.492]  Because all it is, in their own documents, is a text, and it'll go directly to them!
[01:27:22.947 --> 01:27:23.367]  Exactly.
[01:27:23.607 --> 01:27:36.610]  The same people created the peak oil scam in the 50s when they said that, you know, apparently the last drop of oil would have been produced, what was it, about seven, eight years ago now.
[01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:37.990]  We've already passed that point.
[01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:42.531]  And it was, again, the same people, the same oil companies.
[01:27:44.372 --> 01:27:46.412]  Well, it's part and parcel of all this.
[01:27:48.826 --> 01:27:59.616]  They just push the same agenda, and they've bound it into the 9-11 Truth Movement, they've bound it into liberal movements, conservative movements, and people just, like it's a religion, say, don't question it.
[01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:02.279]  Folks, you'd better go read the documents.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:04.621]  Exactly.
[01:28:04.861 --> 01:28:13.469]  For most people who attach themselves to it, from what I can see, having lived with some of them and been around them, and you know,
[01:28:14.116 --> 01:28:16.217]  My brother's been around these kind of people as well.
[01:28:16.597 --> 01:28:17.777]  It's just an ego thing.
[01:28:18.077 --> 01:28:21.719]  It's self-importance and they don't know what's really behind it.
[01:28:21.739 --> 01:28:32.202]  So you've got an army of misinformed people who are pushing this and getting their dictates from transnational oil companies and elitists like the Queen and the Rothschilds.
[01:28:32.882 --> 01:28:33.603]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:33.623 --> 01:28:37.864]  We'll get into professors saying big money behind global warming propaganda.
[01:28:38.604 --> 01:28:40.525]  We'll talk about the Queen and a lot more.
[01:28:41.045 --> 01:28:41.545]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.295 --> 01:28:47.317]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.197 --> 01:28:50.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:58.043]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[01:28:58.123 --> 01:28:59.503]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:29:03.869 --> 01:29:08.311]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:29:08.651 --> 01:29:10.732]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:12.193]  They keep you down.
[01:29:12.353 --> 01:29:13.253]  They keep you blue.
[01:29:13.553 --> 01:29:16.435]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:29:18.455 --> 01:29:20.576]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:29:20.917 --> 01:29:26.279]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:29:28.207 --> 01:29:32.748]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:29:32.788 --> 01:29:36.129]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:29:37.630 --> 01:29:42.491]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[01:29:42.571 --> 01:29:46.192]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:29:47.052 --> 01:29:49.193]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[01:29:49.293 --> 01:29:50.073]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:55.620]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:29:55.801 --> 01:29:57.241]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:29:57.341 --> 01:30:00.282]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:30:00.402 --> 01:30:03.262]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:30:03.462 --> 01:30:06.143]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[01:30:06.663 --> 01:30:13.125]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:31:44.337 --> 01:31:44.918]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[01:31:44.998 --> 01:31:47.079]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:11.609]  I love my family.
[01:32:11.649 --> 01:32:16.951]  And as an extension of that, I love all of humanity.
[01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:19.331]  I just want to see con artists and crooks punished.
[01:32:20.732 --> 01:32:24.613]  When you have hundreds of pages of Club of Rome, CFR, Bilderberg.
[01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:30.954]  CFR openly says they want to scrap the dollar by design to bring in the Amaro.
[01:32:31.995 --> 01:32:34.075]  And then Fox News says we're conspiracy theorists.
[01:32:34.135 --> 01:32:35.896]  It doesn't exist when it's at CFR.org.
[01:32:38.482 --> 01:32:41.584]  Officially put out by them, not just a paper, but their official policy.
[01:32:45.086 --> 01:32:57.953]  To know that they openly talk about how they're going to control every aspect of our life, bureaucrats ruling over us, the animal ID, the premises ID, where you make one wrong move, they take your farm or ranch, you basically sign control of your land over to them.
[01:32:58.633 --> 01:33:01.555]  Not even a law, they just threaten you and tell you, sign it, you sign it.
[01:33:02.722 --> 01:33:04.603]  To know all of this is coming into place.
[01:33:04.643 --> 01:33:08.404]  And the more taxes, the more funds they get, the more they're going to use it to control us.
[01:33:10.365 --> 01:33:15.127]  They're arming all the different forestry services and BLM with automatic and semi-automatic weapons.
[01:33:15.147 --> 01:33:17.148]  They're running around harassing everybody.
[01:33:17.228 --> 01:33:19.429]  It's just a reign of terror.
[01:33:20.029 --> 01:33:21.050]  And it's a new religion.
[01:33:21.090 --> 01:33:26.952]  They've brainwashed millions of college students who openly walk around saying, we've got to get rid of the majority of people.
[01:33:26.992 --> 01:33:27.613]  We've got to kill 80%.
[01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:36.038]  I mean, I had Dr. Pianca's graduate students sending me threatening emails showing me, you know, links to, oh, you don't like Pianca, say him kill 90.
[01:33:36.418 --> 01:33:38.819]  Well, here's a link to my PhD.
[01:33:38.939 --> 01:33:41.639]  I say all of us need to be killed, every human.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:44.580]  And they're going to be your cops, your social workers.
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:45.720]  They're going to run all this.
[01:33:46.141 --> 01:33:47.701]  And the elite absolutely love it.
[01:33:49.047 --> 01:33:51.629]  And yes, Paul, it's not just in England.
[01:33:51.749 --> 01:33:52.910]  It's here, too.
[01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:55.973]  Let's finish up talking about their grand agenda.
[01:33:56.633 --> 01:33:58.595]  They're saying if you add on to your house in the U.S.
[01:33:58.635 --> 01:34:07.942]  or England or Europe, they're going to inspect it and give you taxes, what type of windows you have, taxes on every road with transponders, all roads to be toll roads.
[01:34:07.962 --> 01:34:09.783]  That's official ten years ago.
[01:34:09.863 --> 01:34:10.964]  Now it's being announced.
[01:34:11.624 --> 01:34:13.306]  So that also tracks and traces you.
[01:34:14.666 --> 01:34:18.388]  But yeah, talk more about this Carnegie situation, because here it is.
[01:34:18.428 --> 01:34:23.790]  You've got links to their own document where they're saying zero carbon dioxide footprint.
[01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:25.190]  Well, humans exhale that.
[01:34:25.230 --> 01:34:26.871]  See, we are the enemy.
[01:34:26.971 --> 01:34:29.112]  We are the scourge.
[01:34:29.272 --> 01:34:32.113]  Folks, you understand what this means, and I'm going to say it again.
[01:34:33.774 --> 01:34:39.476]  Dumping nickel cadmium and lead and toxic waste and things that you can't even imagine.
[01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.601]  Right into the ocean.
[01:34:46.801 --> 01:34:48.642]  All the things that they're doing.
[01:34:49.722 --> 01:34:57.506]  The genetic engineering already spreading, already taking over other species, already invading other plants, causing massive problems.
[01:34:58.906 --> 01:35:01.688]  These are life-form combinations that have never existed.
[01:35:02.248 --> 01:35:07.090]  There are hundreds of real environmental problems, but you'll find out it's the big globalists that are behind it all.
[01:35:08.847 --> 01:35:09.708]  In every case.
[01:35:09.768 --> 01:35:18.078]  I mean, they'll throw nuclear reactors into the Russian lakes, into the ocean off the Pacific in the U.S.
[01:35:18.799 --> 01:35:20.280]  They could care less.
[01:35:20.361 --> 01:35:25.907]  I've talked to people that have been in high-level Bilderberg groups, sub-steering committees.
[01:35:26.796 --> 01:35:29.338]  And they could care less.
[01:35:29.818 --> 01:35:32.780]  They want all the power, all the control now.
[01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:35.002]  They don't even care about the environment.
[01:35:35.102 --> 01:35:37.324]  It is a total con job.
[01:35:37.364 --> 01:35:46.010]  Now again, they brainwash you with legitimate-sounding environmentalism for decades, then they come in with their solution once you're sold, and they say, it's carbon taxes.
[01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:47.291]  Paul comments.
[01:35:48.772 --> 01:35:55.517]  Well, what I find interesting, as you've documented, is the link to population reduction, because
[01:35:57.369 --> 01:36:18.479]  You look at the quotes from these ecologists from the 60s and 70s when of course the global cooling phenomenon was in vogue then because as we know the earth goes through cycles of heating and cooling throughout history which is proven and at that point it was going through a cooling period post 1940 to 1975 which was coincidentally
[01:36:22.719 --> 01:36:33.928]  When, you know, carbon emissions were increasing at a rapid rate, proving the link is non-existent, that carbon lags behind temperature increase, as is also proven by the ice core samples.
[01:36:34.748 --> 01:36:43.495]  But then you had people like Paul Ehrlich, who was a German scientist who, like Mr. Al Gore, won the Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:36:44.276 --> 01:36:47.799]  And he was saying things like, in 1968 he said, in 10 years,
[01:36:51.691 --> 01:36:57.237]  In 1969, sorry, in ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct.
[01:36:57.457 --> 01:37:02.041]  Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish.
[01:37:02.822 --> 01:37:05.985]  And that was supposedly because we were about to enter this new ice age.
[01:37:07.927 --> 01:37:14.954]  In 1971, Reid Bryson in Global Ecology, Readings Towards a Rational Strategy for Man said,
[01:37:16.003 --> 01:37:18.225]  The battle to feed humanity is over.
[01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:21.107]  In the 1970s, the world will undergo famine.
[01:37:21.187 --> 01:37:26.031]  Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon.
[01:37:26.071 --> 01:37:29.033]  Now, population control is the only answer.
[01:37:29.893 --> 01:37:36.938]  And then you've got others like, again, Paul Ehrlich, quote, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000.
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:43.243]  Well, I'm in England at the moment, and I can vouch for the fact that it still exists.
[01:37:43.823 --> 01:37:44.524]  But these were the
[01:37:45.242 --> 01:37:51.272]  This was the fear-mongering campaign that dovetailed the so-called global cooling threat in the 1970s.
[01:37:51.292 --> 01:37:56.500]  Now, I want to explain to people, one facet of hundreds is the animal ID and the premises ID.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.345]  Now, only Texas, quote, passed it into law.
[01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:10.657]  But then you read it, it's only regulatory, and once you sign it, but everybody else is signing on, because if your kid's in 4-H, you show up to 4-H, they escort you with police off the premises.
[01:38:11.078 --> 01:38:18.563]  If your family farm hasn't been registered, the big agribusiness wrote all this into law, they have exemptions.
[01:38:18.643 --> 01:38:28.010]  Like, they'll have one tag per thousand chickens that's $14, but you've got to have a $14 tag, or a $10 tag depending on the tag, per chicken yourself.
[01:38:28.670 --> 01:38:33.192]  It's written to shut down people that only have 100 chickens or 20 chickens or 30 cows.
[01:38:34.072 --> 01:38:36.173]  They even admit this in their own documents.
[01:38:36.273 --> 01:38:40.675]  And now, idiots that signed on to the thing in Texas, a cow dies.
[01:38:40.715 --> 01:38:42.035]  They've got new people that spy.
[01:38:42.055 --> 01:38:46.037]  If a cow dies or gets struck by lightning, you don't report it within 48 hours.
[01:38:46.677 --> 01:38:48.178]  $2,000 a day fines.
[01:38:48.478 --> 01:38:49.718]  Then they take your farm.
[01:38:50.339 --> 01:38:51.459]  You're signing over.
[01:38:51.479 --> 01:38:52.219]  It's not even a law.
[01:38:52.279 --> 01:38:56.421]  It's a corporate agreement where you go into these, quote, public laws
[01:38:57.296 --> 01:39:05.622]  Just like there's no law to take vaccines, but they'll still take your kids if you don't, in many cases, if they think you're ignorant and, you know, they don't go after wealthy people that they know can find them.
[01:39:05.642 --> 01:39:06.603]  They only go after the ignorant.
[01:39:07.143 --> 01:39:09.685]  I mean, this is just lawless criminality.
[01:39:10.546 --> 01:39:15.570]  Animal ID, premises ID, when you sign the agreement, now they're coming on your property for no reason.
[01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:23.856]  I mean, this is just where they're making everyone criminals, going after all self-sufficiency, and they say they want to force us off the land into cities.
[01:39:24.702 --> 01:39:30.646]  I mean, this is total control, where only Big Agra owns the food, and then they can force you to eat the GMO as well.
[01:39:34.909 --> 01:39:35.790]  Paul, elaborate.
[01:39:37.751 --> 01:39:52.442]  Well, it ties into what Daniel Ashtewan talks about, which is what the Portuguese politician Barroso has talked about in Bilderberg meetings, which is the desire to bring about a, quote, post-industrial revolution.
[01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:58.044]  Which essentially means the complete evisceration of the middle class.
[01:39:58.864 --> 01:40:08.928]  Now let's explain again, the Industrial Revolution broke up the monopolies, where to have any business you had to be certified by the local nobleman, who was again certified to the queen or king.
[01:40:10.268 --> 01:40:14.590]  They desperately, and they admit this, they want to end their competition.
[01:40:15.405 --> 01:40:17.926]  Okay, I mean, they'll be dumping toxic waste in the streets.
[01:40:17.966 --> 01:40:18.607]  They don't care.
[01:40:18.927 --> 01:40:23.229]  It's about the power to come in and selectively regulate and shut down.
[01:40:23.269 --> 01:40:23.590]  Go ahead.
[01:40:25.230 --> 01:40:33.635]  Right, and it's about, with the oil agenda, Bildberg said that the plan was to get it up to $200 a barrel.
[01:40:34.816 --> 01:40:36.176]  And what is it today?
[01:40:36.196 --> 01:40:36.176]  $108, $109.
[01:40:36.336 --> 01:40:38.738]  It's going to get up there eventually.
[01:40:38.878 --> 01:40:40.219]  It's over $109 right now.
[01:40:40.239 --> 01:40:44.461]  And the more you hike oil prices,
[01:40:45.171 --> 01:40:54.154]  The more difficult Westerners find it to maintain their living standards and they get lowered towards the second, you know, status level.
[01:40:54.594 --> 01:41:07.859]  But they built our transportation and our economic grid on sprawl, on highly separated urban centers, where you have to do this and now they've got a stranglehold and can squeeze everything out of us with the fuel.
[01:41:07.879 --> 01:41:08.239]  Go ahead.
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.020]  Exactly, and that's why
[01:41:12.043 --> 01:41:18.088]  At the previous Bilderberg meeting, Kissinger said there were plans to double the price of oil.
[01:41:18.128 --> 01:41:18.828]  That happened.
[01:41:18.848 --> 01:41:22.271]  The next step is $200 a barrel.
[01:41:22.531 --> 01:41:24.032]  So that's where they're heading.
[01:41:24.072 --> 01:41:38.843]  And they've said on record that it's about creating this post-industrial revolution and squeezing the middle class into non-existence to create, you know, their dream, the masters and the firsts, just like it was in history.
[01:41:38.963 --> 01:41:40.224]  They want to reintroduce it.
[01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:49.343]  Now, I want to add here, Paul, that people debate whether this financial collapse that's happening is by design or not.
[01:41:49.904 --> 01:42:03.777]  In their own documents, they admit, and we've quoted and covered those here, and I guess I've said many times, even the Financial Times of London has admitted, they had the power to put out endless currency, endless credit, endless liquidity.
[01:42:04.578 --> 01:42:05.759]  They decided to do it.
[01:42:07.299 --> 01:42:29.737]  And then now that they got the bubble to full size, and almost everyone is leveraged out into debt, and then once things implode, even if you've quote, got some currency, they're at the same time devaluing it, while prices go up, and while the economy contracts, they'll then just bankrupt all their front banks, which they're going to do, but in the meantime, with that fiat bubble they created,
[01:42:30.117 --> 01:42:32.998]  Giving themselves the lion's share of that fiat currency.
[01:42:33.378 --> 01:42:36.219]  They bought up the mines, the roads, the water districts.
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.820]  They bought your politicians.
[01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:39.581]  They bought the movie theater chains.
[01:42:39.941 --> 01:42:41.502]  They bought the ranching companies.
[01:42:41.542 --> 01:42:43.182]  They bought the meatpacking companies.
[01:42:43.442 --> 01:42:44.783]  They bought them all over the world.
[01:42:45.283 --> 01:42:51.868]  So, this wasn't even done as a free market exercise of, quote, consolidation and monopoly capitalism.
[01:42:52.188 --> 01:43:08.699]  This is global economic warfare with then, they now admit, the military shifting over to rapid response teams for civilian revolts, where they're going to control all the governments, but they're going to need rapid reaction 10,000 man forces to go in and just machine gun and bomb
[01:43:09.499 --> 01:43:12.242]  And that's what the British Ministry of Defense report says as well.
[01:43:12.542 --> 01:43:19.427]  So it's all public in the intellectual government policy reports and planning documents for what they're doing.
[01:43:19.748 --> 01:43:29.055]  This is a hell world run by them where they own 95% of the resources and they centrifugal create the crises to suck out that last five.
[01:43:29.435 --> 01:43:33.358]  Once you're all in lockdown grid cities, then they release bioweapons and exterminate us.
[01:43:33.378 --> 01:43:33.679]  Go ahead.
[01:43:37.213 --> 01:43:50.606]  I read a Reuters report today that said, you know, even when Bush or Bernanke say that the policy of the United States government is to have a strong dollar, that means that the policy is to have a weaker dollar.
[01:43:50.986 --> 01:44:00.195]  So you've got even the establishment media admitting that they just engaged in direct double-thinking every time Greenspan or Bernanke
[01:44:00.922 --> 01:44:09.410]  You know, get an opportunity to talk about the dollar when they're abroad in places like China or Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.
[01:44:09.450 --> 01:44:10.611]  They always badmouth it.
[01:44:11.232 --> 01:44:15.916]  They told the Arabs to remove the dollar peg two weeks ago.
[01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:16.377]  That's it.
[01:44:16.397 --> 01:44:17.137]  Let me add to that.
[01:44:17.177 --> 01:44:21.922]  In fact, that's where I didn't add my final point when I got off into my pontificating.
[01:44:22.777 --> 01:44:36.786]  The evidence that they're imploding it by design is that Greenspan, Bush, Bernanke, the head of the Bank of England, all of them run around bad-mouthing the dollar, but then they have to publicly deny they're killing it, so Bush says, we're not even in a recession.
[01:44:37.087 --> 01:44:38.227]  We have a strong dollar.
[01:44:38.387 --> 01:44:39.008]  These are quotes.
[01:44:39.868 --> 01:44:41.810]  We're in a bubble neck right now.
[01:44:42.210 --> 01:44:43.611]  The bubble's going to continue.
[01:44:44.291 --> 01:44:46.353]  Everything's fine while doing every seat.
[01:44:46.653 --> 01:44:48.694]  That's like when a military attacks your fortress.
[01:44:49.955 --> 01:44:55.196]  They're bullhorning, this is not an assault, so you just hesitate long enough so they can get the job done.
[01:44:55.256 --> 01:44:56.197]  It's meant to confuse.
[01:44:56.237 --> 01:45:02.138]  It's meant to where you're going to figure out they're lying, but it still kind of makes you stop and debate for a moment.
[01:45:02.158 --> 01:45:12.181]  It's like they publicly write books calling for world government, world taxes, taking all your freedoms, but then Richard Haass will go on CNN and say there's no move for a world government, there's no Amaro.
[01:45:12.998 --> 01:45:20.222]  Because then they know the debate will be about how they're liars, and is it real, instead of, do we want this?
[01:45:20.822 --> 01:45:35.510]  So, the dollar's gone, we're imploding, we're on fire, mayday, mayday, mayday, it's already sucking England and Europe down with it, but again, the elites have pre-positioned their police state grid, they're bringing us into this global crisis, which will then fully shear us to the bone.
[01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:35.811]  Paul?
[01:45:37.311 --> 01:45:41.774]  Oh yeah, they've got the solutions already in place, that's the whole point, it's order out of chaos.
[01:45:43.092 --> 01:45:51.175]  But I mean, when Bush talks about the dollar and Bernanke talks about it, that's not going to get across to the U.S.
[01:45:51.295 --> 01:45:57.597]  audience, but it is registered in the Arab states and in China and places like that, and that's why the dollar continues to crash.
[01:45:58.418 --> 01:46:07.781]  And you know, you had the expert on a few days ago who said that toilet paper would be worth more than the dollar in two years.
[01:46:09.113 --> 01:46:13.055]  And Bush doesn't even admit to the fact that the US is in a recession.
[01:46:13.075 --> 01:46:30.664]  And how they hide that is by, you know, making the inflation numbers and the unemployment numbers, massaging them and keeping them secret, which is what Ron Paul confronted Bernanke about in the committee meeting two or three weeks ago.
[01:46:31.224 --> 01:46:34.166]  And Bernanke was sat there smiling like a Cheshire cat.
[01:46:35.208 --> 01:46:47.616]  Because obviously he knew everything Paul was saying was absolutely on point, but he still just blithely repeated these mantras about strong dollar and inflation being under control.
[01:46:48.677 --> 01:46:50.518]  Everybody knows that it's complete hogwash.
[01:46:50.838 --> 01:46:51.739]  And here's the problem.
[01:46:53.239 --> 01:46:57.802]  Only 25% in every major poll index, some are 20, some are 30, but it's about 25%.
[01:46:59.469 --> 01:47:06.794]  Most still believe whatever the government says, but the problem is the majority of them are what I call mid-level technocrats.
[01:47:07.155 --> 01:47:08.856]  They make $200,000, $300,000 a year.
[01:47:09.236 --> 01:47:10.537]  They work at computer companies.
[01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.739]  They work in executive positions in government.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.942]  They think they're the government because they're overall good people.
[01:47:17.919 --> 01:47:21.142]  Uh, though they're arrogant and full of hubris, then they think the whole government's like that.
[01:47:21.182 --> 01:47:22.663]  They haven't seen the compartmentalization.
[01:47:23.063 --> 01:47:24.664]  They feel like they're part of the system.
[01:47:25.045 --> 01:47:29.989]  So, at a subconscious level, they then defend the government, no matter what it does.
[01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:36.674]  And we could, we still have some time, reverse some of this and have a soft, somewhat soft landing, crash landing.
[01:47:37.705 --> 01:47:43.946]  Instead of going into the ground at 500 miles an hour, we might get our landing gear down and just, you know, maybe flip the plane and kill a few people.
[01:47:44.466 --> 01:47:45.246]  That isn't going to happen.
[01:47:45.266 --> 01:47:57.888]  They've sped the plane up to 2,000 miles an hour, and they're giggling and snickering and running around laughing and gibbering, because as things get crazier, they're getting crazier, as they have to, with cognitive dissonance, keep buying more into it.
[01:47:58.709 --> 01:48:04.550]  And so, see, Bush is speaking to them, the technocrats, going, don't worry, you're in control, everything's fine.
[01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:06.470]  Heaven help us, Paul.
[01:48:08.069 --> 01:48:14.351]  Well, I mean, this is from the same people who say, we create our own reality.
[01:48:15.472 --> 01:48:34.699]  Now, they may be able to live in that delusional world, but for the rest of us, if they're creating their own reality, when, in our reality, the world's going to hell, and the economy's on its knees, then our reality is hell on earth, compared to theirs, which they say they create.
[01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:36.040]  I mean, these people...
[01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:38.776]  These people should not be in government anymore.
[01:48:38.796 --> 01:48:39.957]  They should be put in prison.
[01:48:41.417 --> 01:48:49.718]  Because they're completely coming out with ludicrous things like reduce carbon emissions to absolute zero when humans breathe carbon dioxide.
[01:48:51.739 --> 01:48:53.979]  Well, that's our chief gas output.
[01:48:54.719 --> 01:48:55.419]  That and methane.
[01:48:56.619 --> 01:49:02.820]  Methane comes out the tailpipe and carbon dioxide comes out the blower.
[01:49:03.981 --> 01:49:05.841]  But I mean, I don't think it's going to get any better
[01:49:06.411 --> 01:49:13.655]  Obama, Hillary, and McCain are all pledging 60-80% cuts in carbon emissions by 2050.
[01:49:15.836 --> 01:49:19.818]  Obama and Hillary, obviously, you know, they're favourites to win.
[01:49:20.258 --> 01:49:22.159]  But for an 80% reduction?
[01:49:22.799 --> 01:49:29.722]  So, it's little better than what the Carnegie Institute are demanding with zero carbon emissions.
[01:49:31.043 --> 01:49:32.464]  Paul Watson, I want to get into
[01:49:33.425 --> 01:49:38.108]  Your report today, Professor, big money behind global warming propaganda.
[01:49:38.908 --> 01:49:43.050]  And the other story you did yesterday is in the news and focus, right hand side of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:49.854]  This needs to get out to everybody, with the head of the CFR and others calling for world government and micromanaging your life to death.
[01:49:53.832 --> 01:49:55.493]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:49:55.813 --> 01:49:59.274]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:49:59.434 --> 01:50:01.294]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:01.314 --> 01:50:04.655]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:50:04.975 --> 01:50:10.457]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:50:10.757 --> 01:50:14.678]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:50:54.170 --> 01:50:54.450]  Fact.
[01:50:54.631 --> 01:51:00.557]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:51:00.678 --> 01:51:04.942]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:51:05.022 --> 01:51:12.491]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:12.691]  Yes.
[01:51:12.711 --> 01:51:13.372]  The solution.
[01:51:13.492 --> 01:51:17.534]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[01:51:39.028 --> 01:51:40.029]  We're good to go.
[01:51:54.432 --> 01:51:55.073]  It's progressing.
[01:51:55.513 --> 01:51:59.398]  And it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[01:51:59.878 --> 01:52:01.320]  We are entering Martial Law.
[01:52:01.801 --> 01:52:03.963]  There are ten telling signs of Martial Law.
[01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:05.725]  America has them all.
[01:52:06.206 --> 01:52:10.230]  Use the short time left to protect you and your family with the vital information in this book.

[01:52:18.796 --> 01:52:23.858]  Know exactly what you'll need to have hidden to live and how to survive under severe martial law.
[01:52:24.298 --> 01:52:26.859]  The worst part of martial law is in the beginning stages.
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:34.103]  SurviveMartialLaw.com will show you how to act around controlling troops, where to store life-saving supplies, and what to look for.
[01:52:34.924 --> 01:52:37.066]  Surviving can be difficult, but possible.
[01:52:37.646 --> 01:52:41.869]  Arm yourself with the knowledge, as this is the only weapon you will have to protect your family.
[01:52:42.329 --> 01:52:48.914]  Go to S-U-R-V-I-V-E-M-A-R-T-I-A-L-L-A-W dot com, or call 608-819-8011.
[01:52:48.974 --> 01:52:50.335]  Act today, as there will be no...
[01:53:10.567 --> 01:53:24.259]  By making 50% of the life-giving gas on the planet in a symbiotic relationship between plants and animals, photosynthesis, and animal respiration, they have a total monopoly on life on the planet.
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:31.926]  And if they can have a monopoly on diamonds or a monopoly on oil, why not have a monopoly on air?
[01:53:32.826 --> 01:53:38.131]  While you're scared to death under your table at night from carbon dioxide thinking it's gonna devil kill you any minute,
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:42.762]  They are busy pumping the atmosphere full of everything you can imagine and your water.
[01:53:44.443 --> 01:53:48.404]  And the more concern you get about it, then they've got, don't worry, we'll regulate and control you more.
[01:53:51.186 --> 01:54:06.873]  I would challenge everyone to go to InfoWars.com, click through on the secure shopping cart, and get the GMO trilogy, two DVD films, and an audio CD for $19.95 to understand true environmental crises that's hurting the birds, the bees, and the people, namely.
[01:54:08.047 --> 01:54:11.008]  And to understand what we're facing, again, at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:11.028 --> 01:54:16.691]  Paul, I want to get in this segment and the next one's coming on, and I appreciate you joining us and spending so much time with us on your busy schedule.
[01:54:17.271 --> 01:54:18.451]  I want to get into this other report.
[01:54:18.491 --> 01:54:20.692]  Professor, big money behind global warming propaganda.
[01:54:22.013 --> 01:54:23.273]  Just shows it's starting to come out.
[01:54:24.494 --> 01:54:25.894]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:26.195 --> 01:54:28.816]  We've added better servers, more material.
[01:54:29.816 --> 01:54:31.297]  You run PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:31.697 --> 01:54:36.879]  Give people that aren't members and members a report on what you get when you are a member for 15 cents a day.
[01:54:38.433 --> 01:54:57.898]  Well, I think a lot of people are confused into thinking that you just get Alex's documentary films, but in reality we had two or three extra video reports every single week, most of which are in streaming flash quality, which means you don't have to sit there and wait for it to download.
[01:54:58.516 --> 01:55:05.258]  The best videos that we put out are all in streaming flash, so you can play them straight away as you would on YouTube or Google Video.
[01:55:05.638 --> 01:55:07.519]  But it's 20 times better in quality.
[01:55:07.539 --> 01:55:08.399]  It's just, it's incredible.
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:09.760]  Exactly.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.321]  You said you were introducing high def.
[01:55:12.401 --> 01:55:28.026]  It's almost high def at the moment, but the back catalogue, because it's been online since April 2004, that's nearly four years, is so massive that not only are you getting access to the films, but you're getting access to a library
[01:55:29.031 --> 01:55:39.158]  Um, a video, um, a multimedia material that, you know, you could sit there and watch it for six months and you still wouldn't watch it all.
[01:55:39.178 --> 01:55:44.161]  So you're getting so much on top of all the stuff we add from day to day.
[01:55:45.402 --> 01:55:50.765]  You can get three months free right now when you sign up for a year or get a monthly trial membership for $5.95.
[01:55:51.406 --> 01:55:56.029]  With the dollar being devalued, I'm going to tell you in the next few months, we're probably going to have to go up on price because of our cost.
[01:55:56.846 --> 01:55:59.387]  We're using about 50 terabytes a month right now.
[01:55:59.467 --> 01:56:08.892]  I've bought 200, and that's because we are going to start, I'm going to reload all of my 18 films in the high def, even though only portions of them were shot in high def.
[01:56:09.632 --> 01:56:18.657]  Most of Endgame was shot in high def HD, and a lot of Terror Storm was shot in it, and so those are going to be in high def.
[01:56:19.968 --> 01:56:22.549]  I mean, you want high-def, folks, you're going to get high-def soon.
[01:56:22.969 --> 01:56:25.290]  PrisonPlanet.tv, be sure and go check it out.
[01:56:25.890 --> 01:56:28.892]  Professor, big money behind global warming propaganda.
[01:56:28.932 --> 01:56:29.732]  Great story, Paul.
[01:56:31.152 --> 01:56:41.256]  Yeah, it just goes to show that this so-called consensus that global warming is man-made is imploding on a daily basis.
[01:56:41.957 --> 01:56:42.617]  Kind of like the
[01:56:43.542 --> 01:56:50.167]  The 9-11 Truth Movement has an army of professors and scientists and scholars that doubt the official 9-11 story.
[01:56:50.868 --> 01:56:55.611]  So does the climate change arena, because there's a growing amount that do.
[01:56:56.132 --> 01:56:58.554]  But they're always shunned by the mainstream media.
[01:56:58.574 --> 01:57:02.497]  Well, more than that, now there's calls every day for their arrest.
[01:57:02.517 --> 01:57:04.358]  They're saying it's like Holocaust denial.
[01:57:04.678 --> 01:57:05.639]  It needs to be illegal.
[01:57:06.428 --> 01:57:16.135]  Exactly, and when it gets to that level again, they're only discrediting themselves by reaching to such a ridiculous extreme and showing those in a good light.
[01:57:17.757 --> 01:57:20.098]  Stay there, I want to talk about this new story you've got.
[01:57:20.479 --> 01:57:28.405]  The story, Professor, big money behind global warming propaganda, and the other one he did yesterday, new proposal to fight global warming, put in civilization, kill billions.
[01:57:28.725 --> 01:57:31.467]  These are both on Prison Planet, these stories need to get out to everyone.
[01:57:35.501 --> 01:57:37.562]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.103 --> 01:57:41.365]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.050 --> 01:57:50.731]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.351 --> 01:57:52.432]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:54.233]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.873 --> 01:57:55.714]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.475 --> 01:57:57.415]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.035 --> 01:58:01.958]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.218 --> 01:58:04.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:58:05.450 --> 01:58:06.291]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.279 --> 01:58:15.621]  Final signal with Paul Watson today.
[01:58:16.542 --> 01:58:23.210]  The people that force the one-child policy on China, are the people that are setting up the global warming hooks, the global taxation grid.
[01:58:23.883 --> 01:58:36.045]  Continuing with Professor Big Money, behind global warming propaganda, a Prison Planet article, another professor challenges the so-called consensus behind man-made global climate change, as we have one of the coldest winters on record.
[01:58:36.085 --> 01:58:36.325]  Paul?
[01:58:37.605 --> 01:58:44.187]  That's right, and China, the biggest producer of CO2, has just had its coldest winter in 100 years.
[01:58:45.027 --> 01:58:49.328]  Saudi Arabia is reeling from a massive cold snap that's unprecedented.
[01:58:50.168 --> 01:58:51.768]  But this professor
[01:58:52.754 --> 01:58:56.496]  I'm a tourist professor of physics from the University of Connecticut.
[01:58:57.556 --> 01:59:02.838]  Basically, I think he was neutral on the issue, but then he visited New York and saw a giant billboard.
[01:59:03.539 --> 01:59:09.921]  I think it was a diesel billboard, which I've got up there on the article, about global warming.
[01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:14.683]  And then he later learned that the cost of the billboard was $700,000 a month.
[01:59:14.723 --> 01:59:17.044]  So that's how much it costs to advertise this.
[01:59:21.818 --> 01:59:38.927]  And he basically makes the point that we live in a carbon starved environment compared to past periods of history like the Jurassic period when levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were as much as 11 times or more.
[01:59:38.947 --> 01:59:40.728]  That's right, it's a life driver.
[01:59:40.848 --> 01:59:45.570]  Plants live longer, humans live longer in higher oxygen carbon dioxide environment.
[01:59:45.590 --> 01:59:45.890]  Go ahead.
[01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:49.032]  Right, so by comparison
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:52.281]  We're living in a carbon dioxide starved environment.
[01:59:54.602 --> 02:00:06.907]  But if they're going to reduce carbon emissions to absolute zero, which is what we're being told by this Carnegie report, then they're going to have to kill six billion of us first because we exhale it.
[02:00:07.628 --> 02:00:17.792]  There's also the fact that they're going to have to completely eliminate the Amazon rainforest because most experts say that through
[02:00:18.351 --> 02:00:23.775]  The rotting vegetation, it releases more carbon dioxide than it absorbs.
[02:00:24.736 --> 02:00:27.659]  So in that sense, they're going to have to deforest most of the plants.
[02:00:27.719 --> 02:00:35.605]  I was about to say, you want to do a headline where, to reach UN Carnegie goal, all plankton and plants must be killed immediately.
[02:00:35.925 --> 02:00:36.986]  And then just explain it.
[02:00:37.246 --> 02:00:44.672]  It's so asinine that we have people in the US who can't find China on a map, much less under this global warming system.
[02:00:44.892 --> 02:00:46.894]  They make no cuts, we make all the cuts.
[02:00:47.254 --> 02:00:48.254]  It's just pure bull!
[02:00:48.615 --> 02:00:51.355]  Much like Goebbels said, the bigger the lie, the more they'll believe it.
[02:00:51.736 --> 02:00:54.016]  It's just... it's such a fraud!
[02:00:54.056 --> 02:00:56.197]  I mean, any moron knows it's a fraud!
[02:00:57.658 --> 02:01:02.679]  The problem is that one in five Americans believe that the sun revolves around the Earth.
[02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:12.163]  So, you know, they're probably at the same level of intellect as that Rothschild guy who thought that Jupiter was closer to the sun than Earth.
[02:01:14.318 --> 02:01:16.919]  But 3% is what this professor is saying.
[02:01:16.939 --> 02:01:17.779]  You said it's 6%.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:23.202]  He says humans are responsible for 3% of the carbon dioxide.
[02:01:23.222 --> 02:01:27.223]  Well, well, well, the UN says at the top humans are responsible for 6%.
[02:01:28.144 --> 02:01:30.665]  We ought to have giant carbon generating factories.
[02:01:31.204 --> 02:01:32.885]  I mean, it just generates life.
[02:01:34.386 --> 02:01:45.192]  Carbon dioxide is more tied to plant life than even water, and I've seen the studies going back 50 years of desertification expanding in the Sahara because of carbon dioxide level.
[02:01:45.412 --> 02:01:59.701]  I remember reading a decade, more than that ago, Paul, about real scientists, real institutions, you weren't even looking at global warming, it was non-political, saying plants are in trouble because the earth is in a low carbon dioxide system right now.
[02:02:00.925 --> 02:02:11.990]  Right, exactly, and that's what the studies show from past periods in history where high levels of carbon dioxide produced, you know, a bountiful environment.
[02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:29.997]  But again, the source of what we're being told about global warming is these elitists that control oil companies and control governments, and we've got this army of eco-mentalists who are more prepared to believe that propaganda than believe these scientists who are pointing out the basic facts.
[02:02:30.077 --> 02:02:33.961]  And that's because from first grade to college they were brainwashed and they can't understand it.
[02:02:34.262 --> 02:02:38.687]  Paul Watson, running presentplanet.com, fabulous job, great reports.
[02:02:39.167 --> 02:02:43.833]  I'm asking people, if they choose to take this mission, to get your two stories and get them out to everybody.
[02:02:45.988 --> 02:02:48.529]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:02:48.849 --> 02:02:50.130]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[02:02:50.410 --> 02:02:52.391]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:02:52.571 --> 02:02:54.312]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:02:54.452 --> 02:02:55.693]  The Late Great USA.
[02:02:55.933 --> 02:02:57.354]  America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:02:57.714 --> 02:03:04.557]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:03:08.819 --> 02:03:12.201]  Whether you're looking for survival and wellness products like Berkey water filters,
[02:03:12.641 --> 02:03:12.901]  I think so.
[02:03:43.421 --> 02:03:46.022]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:03:46.342 --> 02:03:51.844]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[02:03:52.464 --> 02:03:58.246]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[02:03:58.966 --> 02:04:02.227]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:06.149]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[02:04:06.769 --> 02:04:10.070]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[02:04:10.726 --> 02:04:15.248]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[02:04:15.969 --> 02:04:17.950]  We will still have two regrets.
[02:04:18.590 --> 02:04:21.932]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[02:04:22.612 --> 02:04:25.514]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[02:04:26.274 --> 02:04:33.137]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[02:04:33.898 --> 02:04:34.218]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:04:34.258 --> 02:04:35.298]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.

[02:04:44.798 --> 02:04:53.182]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[02:04:53.502 --> 02:04:59.185]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[02:04:59.505 --> 02:05:06.028]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC free.
[02:05:06.588 --> 02:05:09.870]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:12.212]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[02:05:49.237 --> 02:05:52.059]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.723 --> 02:05:58.425]  All right, we got about 51 minutes left in transmission.
[02:05:58.465 --> 02:06:02.369]  At the bottom of this hour, I will go directly to your calls in 22 minutes.
[02:06:02.389 --> 02:06:06.632]  From now at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:06.732 --> 02:06:17.061]  Any questions, comments, statements, you disagree, agree with Daniel Estill and best-selling author, investigative journalist, par excellence, 16, 17 years tracking the elusive Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:17.562 --> 02:06:19.003]  We've been having him on every few weeks.
[02:06:20.284 --> 02:06:23.447]  Because he's getting so much new information on a daily basis.
[02:06:23.807 --> 02:06:27.770]  He's also got a tour kicking off in New York right now, here in the United States.
[02:06:27.850 --> 02:06:31.934]  His book is now a bestseller here in the U.S., a global bestseller.
[02:06:32.755 --> 02:06:36.278]  Way over 1.5 million last time I checked sold.
[02:06:36.898 --> 02:06:38.399]  You can get the book discounted.
[02:06:38.419 --> 02:06:43.924]  It's like five bucks less and you'll find it other places at InfoWars.com, the true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:06:44.284 --> 02:06:46.987]  This book has got hundreds of photos, hundreds of documents.
[02:06:47.608 --> 02:06:48.870]  Hundreds of their wicked quotes.
[02:06:48.930 --> 02:06:50.192]  Things you've got to read.
[02:06:50.212 --> 02:06:53.076]  You can also get it paired with Endgame.
[02:06:53.697 --> 02:06:55.480]  And Daniel Eskildon is in that film.
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:06:56.762]  And a lot of the same info is there.
[02:06:57.263 --> 02:06:58.445]  But some info that isn't is there.
[02:06:58.465 --> 02:07:00.188]  Just like his book has info that isn't in my film.
[02:07:00.468 --> 02:07:01.430]  They dovetail together.
[02:07:02.461 --> 02:07:03.403]  Amazing reading.
[02:07:03.463 --> 02:07:04.905]  A great coffee table book.
[02:07:05.005 --> 02:07:07.028]  I have given so many of these to friends and family.
[02:07:07.368 --> 02:07:09.612]  People that are skeptics wake up when they read this book.
[02:07:09.652 --> 02:07:11.715]  It is a lavishly covered book.
[02:07:11.915 --> 02:07:12.917]  Very well done.
[02:07:13.818 --> 02:07:14.880]  Very well appointed book.
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:16.422]  It just looks good, reads good.
[02:07:16.722 --> 02:07:17.764]  The info is powerful.
[02:07:18.604 --> 02:07:22.167]  If there were five stars in book review, I'd give this book five stars.
[02:07:22.568 --> 02:07:27.432]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:07:27.752 --> 02:07:29.473]  I hope you go there and get it if you haven't.
[02:07:29.994 --> 02:07:30.955]  Going to Daniel Estill.
[02:07:30.995 --> 02:07:33.537]  And Daniel, there's a lot we're going to talk about today.
[02:07:33.617 --> 02:07:38.241]  Why they're plunging the dollar, your inside info on that, any other tidbits you've picked up.
[02:07:38.261 --> 02:07:40.123]  But in 20 minutes, we're going to calls.
[02:07:40.183 --> 02:07:43.265]  But first up, my friend, you're here in the United States.
[02:07:44.026 --> 02:07:45.067]  Tell me about your tour.
[02:07:45.905 --> 02:07:47.206]  Sorry Alex, I'm in the United States.
[02:07:47.266 --> 02:07:48.267]  I came in on Sunday night.
[02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:49.267]  We're in New York right now.
[02:07:49.307 --> 02:07:50.748]  We have three days here.
[02:07:51.209 --> 02:07:52.950]  Then we're off to Seattle and Portland.
[02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:55.372]  We have a couple of big shows in Portland.
[02:07:55.392 --> 02:07:56.593]  Then we're off to Los Angeles.
[02:07:56.853 --> 02:08:08.021]  You know, when I was here in the United States in October, hardly anyone outside of the people like you and a few others were willing to talk to us, even though, as you said, my book has sold over a million and a half copies.
[02:08:08.401 --> 02:08:10.342]  At the time, it was published in 44 countries.
[02:08:10.402 --> 02:08:15.346]  Now it's up to 51 countries and translated into 31 languages and the sales
[02:08:15.751 --> 02:08:18.115]  Figures are almost up to 2 million copies worldwide.
[02:08:18.395 --> 02:08:21.260]  Well, this time around we are getting mainstream press attention.
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:22.582]  We did Air America this morning.
[02:08:22.952 --> 02:08:25.493]  We have some television stations as well today and tomorrow.
[02:08:25.833 --> 02:08:30.034]  We're shooting six info commercials this afternoon.
[02:08:30.074 --> 02:08:31.055]  They were up to Portland.
[02:08:31.255 --> 02:08:34.436]  We have a sold-out show there, and then up to Los Angeles.
[02:08:34.456 --> 02:08:52.422]  And again, I think finally the mainstream, at least the mainstream radio and a few television stations, we're not getting any newspapers as of yet, they're waking up, or at least not to lose their credibility completely, they're forced to interview me and give me a little bit of prime time, at least not to look bad in front of their audiences.
[02:08:53.286 --> 02:08:58.088]  Now, Daniel, expanding on that, the reason we're talking about getting press coverage is what?
[02:08:58.188 --> 02:09:04.031]  Six, seven years ago, up until that time, they would never admit that Vildenberg even existed.
[02:09:04.051 --> 02:09:07.272]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, publishers would go.
[02:09:08.072 --> 02:09:10.794]  They would then come back and not allow a word to be published.
[02:09:11.114 --> 02:09:14.095]  They would write other articles saying it's insane, it doesn't exist.
[02:09:14.615 --> 02:09:16.337]  Now it is in the Dallas Morning News.
[02:09:16.357 --> 02:09:19.299]  Now it is when Governor Perry went there.
[02:09:19.319 --> 02:09:22.121]  It is now finally getting attention.
[02:09:22.481 --> 02:09:24.823]  It is finally breaking out, and they don't like that.
[02:09:25.283 --> 02:09:25.844]  Well, exactly.
[02:09:25.864 --> 02:09:31.168]  The only time over the past 15 years where we have had any attention whatsoever from the mainstream press
[02:09:31.553 --> 02:09:31.953]  We're good to go.
[02:09:44.770 --> 02:10:00.673]  The mainstream publications, the Toronto Star, the leading radio stations as well in Canada, they let all that information out and over a million people in 1996 came out to say, we don't want to join the United States, we want Canada as a free and independent nation.
[02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:14.476]  That was the only time in the past six or ten years that we've had so much coverage until, as you said, a few years ago where finally, for the first time, thanks to a lot of people like you who are getting all this information out to your listeners,
[02:10:14.918 --> 02:10:23.623]  The mainstream press begrudgingly are forced to admit that yes, Bilderberg exists, they meet, but again, what they do according to the mainstream press is not all that important.
[02:10:23.923 --> 02:10:35.409]  As you and I know, and as I demonstrate in my book and in your film, it is very important, and the decisions that the Bilderbergers take, accept and affect six and a half billion people in the world.
[02:10:36.391 --> 02:10:48.479]  I want to read a quote of the former chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, the current president of the Council on Foreign Relations, stated in an article, state sovereignty must be altered in the globalized era.
[02:10:48.519 --> 02:10:55.324]  That system of world government must be created and sovereignty eliminated in order to fight global warming as well as terrorism.
[02:10:55.364 --> 02:10:56.465]  He wrote that in 91.
[02:10:56.825 --> 02:11:04.851]  Moreover, states must be prepared to cede some sovereignty to world bodies and the international system is to function, says Haas, globalization thus
[02:11:05.391 --> 02:11:10.174]  Implies that sovereignty is not only becoming weaker in reality, but that it needs to become weaker.
[02:11:10.254 --> 02:11:15.117]  States would be wise to weaken sovereignty in order to protect themselves.
[02:11:15.157 --> 02:11:23.602]  And then suddenly after 91, terrorism starts, the global warming hype starts, now they've got to reduce our carbon footprint, which is what humans exhale.
[02:11:23.883 --> 02:11:26.404]  This is their total system of micromanagement and control.
[02:11:26.424 --> 02:11:30.887]  Well, you know Alex, you just put your finger on it exactly, absolutely right.
[02:11:31.267 --> 02:11:34.394]  Again, what we're dealing with is people with very high principles.
[02:11:34.655 --> 02:11:40.067]  You and I may not agree with their principles, but we have to admit, these people have, you know, a single mindedness of purpose.
[02:11:40.087 --> 02:11:40.949]  They've been going at it...
[02:11:41.311 --> 02:11:42.672]  For a very, very long time.
[02:11:43.492 --> 02:11:52.075]  One of the reasons we're not being as successful as we could be is that we're fighting a very principled opponent with techniques instead of fighting with their principles.
[02:11:52.115 --> 02:11:57.957]  Meaning, understanding what they're doing, understanding where this is coming from, understanding where they're going with all this information.
[02:11:58.277 --> 02:12:01.338]  It's not enough just to learn their names and memorize their faces.
[02:12:01.639 --> 02:12:03.299]  We have to understand why they're doing this.
[02:12:03.339 --> 02:12:05.480]  And again, one of the things you just talked about
[02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:07.682]  It's a destruction of the nation-states.
[02:12:07.962 --> 02:12:21.972]  Now, when you create multi-state unions, as you have, for example, right now in Europe, when you had one country, one constitution, one currency, one border, one army, and before you had nations, nation-states with their constitutions and their currencies, now you don't.
[02:12:21.992 --> 02:12:23.854]  You have this one country called Europe.
[02:12:23.874 --> 02:12:26.736]  You have one country being created called North American Union.
[02:12:26.996 --> 02:12:29.018]  Now, when you create multi-state unions,
[02:12:29.478 --> 02:12:41.296]  Governments lose power at the expense of supranational governing agencies that supersede the authority of nation-states whose leaders, at least on paper, are elected democratically by the people.
[02:12:41.596 --> 02:12:44.601]  And you know, such agreements as the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs.
[02:12:45.163 --> 02:12:47.144]  And the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[02:12:47.444 --> 02:12:56.108]  What they do is they subtly destroy national economies by putting them under the imperatives of world commerce and globalization without borders.
[02:12:56.468 --> 02:12:59.089]  And that's what I mean fighting principles with principles.
[02:12:59.429 --> 02:13:11.214]  People must understand and again I'm very grateful to you for the things that you have been doing on your radio show by letting people and making them understand what the Bilderbergers, the CFR people, the Trilateral Commission
[02:13:11.644 --> 02:13:15.747]  All these secret societies and organizations interlocked amongst themselves.
[02:13:16.107 --> 02:13:22.791]  How they're very, very covertly putting together their plans for the New World Order, which again, go way, way, way back in history.
[02:13:24.332 --> 02:13:28.895]  But we are now alive in a time when we're finally seeing our plan come to fruition.
[02:13:29.355 --> 02:13:32.778]  Well, I think, you know, I think we better get our act together very, very quickly.
[02:13:32.818 --> 02:13:36.440]  I think we're missing a lot of opportunities which are being presented to us.
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:41.023]  And again, one of the reasons, needless to say, the television, which plays such an important part
[02:13:41.408 --> 02:13:56.075]  In destroying, you know, the free human spirit, because unfortunately most people, as you and I know, believe that what's on television is the reality, and if anyone tells them otherwise, people will laugh in your face because they don't believe that there is another reality.
[02:13:56.135 --> 02:14:01.578]  Their simple answer is, well, if it's so important what you're saying is true, why isn't it on television?
[02:14:02.563 --> 02:14:09.972]  Which is an incredibly ignorant position, but they just have never seen the other side to reality, which is the true reality.
[02:14:10.012 --> 02:14:12.836]  Now, Daniel, shifting gears into the dollar.
[02:14:12.896 --> 02:14:19.765]  Two weeks ago, Greenspan went out and told the group of Arab producing members of OPEC
[02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:21.686]  To dump the dollar.
[02:14:22.206 --> 02:14:24.347]  And then I came on air that day and said, this is it.
[02:14:24.367 --> 02:14:25.888]  The dollar is going to plunge like never before.
[02:14:25.948 --> 02:14:26.928]  It wasn't hard to figure out.
[02:14:27.209 --> 02:14:30.270]  Then even mainstream newspapers admitted his statement did that.
[02:14:31.010 --> 02:14:39.275]  Now they're cutting interest rates again, which is causing the dollar to slide even more while simultaneously putting out the news that we're not in a recession and the dollar is strong.
[02:14:39.955 --> 02:14:42.016]  How does this play into destroying nation states?
[02:14:42.216 --> 02:14:43.897]  I mean, God, this is just so simple.
[02:14:43.937 --> 02:14:46.458]  I can't even believe that they're doing this in such a silly way.
[02:14:46.758 --> 02:14:53.681]  Again, I think most people don't read and don't understand that they just follow knee-jerk reactions to whatever people in the media tell them.
[02:14:53.901 --> 02:15:02.324]  You know, in 2005, right after the Bilderberg Conference in Rotterdam, Germany, I said that, you know, the demand destruction is being fully executed right now.
[02:15:02.645 --> 02:15:05.106]  The dollar is going to lose more than 50% of its value.
[02:15:05.126 --> 02:15:08.347]  You know, I was looking at the Spanish edition of my Bilderberg book,
[02:15:09.087 --> 02:15:13.290]  The day before yesterday, and I said to myself, I just want to make sure that it's in there, and of course it is.
[02:15:13.610 --> 02:15:18.853]  And I said to myself, two and a half years ago, I was saying that what's happening today was going to happen.
[02:15:19.093 --> 02:15:23.316]  Now you have Cheney, who dumped his dollars, he just bought Euros.
[02:15:23.636 --> 02:15:24.796]  Nobody's reporting on that.
[02:15:25.137 --> 02:15:31.440]  President Putin in Russia said, you know, for his citizens to get rid of dollars and buy gold and Euros.
[02:15:31.660 --> 02:15:34.162]  The Chinese government is doing exactly the same thing.
[02:15:34.182 --> 02:15:36.123]  You have a guy by the name of Bill Gross,
[02:15:36.839 --> 02:15:43.362]  He's one of the greatest bond managers on Earth, who said last week that we're in the first inning of the housing crash.
[02:15:43.622 --> 02:15:47.004]  Now one of the things that I think people must understand is this.
[02:15:47.324 --> 02:16:03.751]  Now do we really believe that the investment banks that employ some of the brightest minds in America, who have studied at the world's most prestigious universities, who understand the fine points of high finance, thought that ignoring all the standard criteria
[02:16:04.181 --> 02:16:12.145]  For prudent lending, issuing billions and billions of dollars of worthless loans to people with zero credit rating was a good idea?
[02:16:12.606 --> 02:16:13.846]  Obviously the answer is no.
[02:16:14.186 --> 02:16:22.311]  Now, if we know less about high-risk finance than people like David Rockefeller, then the question is, why are these people lending us money?
[02:16:22.845 --> 02:16:28.527]  Until again, we go back in history to 1929 and realize that it wasn't a Great Depression at all.
[02:16:28.848 --> 02:16:30.889]  It was simply a transfer of wealth.
[02:16:31.089 --> 02:16:42.714]  We, the Great Unwashed, as Kissinger and Rockefeller called us, we lost money, we lost houses, we lost our personal wealth and equity, and they gained that equity at our expense.
[02:16:42.734 --> 02:16:50.477]  You know, I told you this before, about 10 years ago, I saw in one of the Bilderberg reports, this one phrase which I didn't understand at the time,
[02:16:50.962 --> 02:16:52.863]  They talked about demand destruction.
[02:16:52.883 --> 02:16:54.063]  That was the phrase itself.
[02:16:54.464 --> 02:16:58.185]  I kind of let it slide because at the time I was just overwhelmed with information.
[02:16:58.525 --> 02:17:00.266]  I didn't quite understand most of it.
[02:17:00.686 --> 02:17:19.294]  Until about two and a half years ago, shortly after stress in 2004, that's the Bilderberg meeting in Italy, you know, I saw that phrase again in the Club of Rome report, and I came across it again in one of the trilateral papers, and then I saw it on the CFR website, and then I saw it again in the Bilderberg report in 2005.
[02:17:20.515 --> 02:17:21.236]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:21.296 --> 02:17:21.816]  A New World Order.
[02:17:50.558 --> 02:17:55.719]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:17:55.779 --> 02:17:57.559]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:00.500]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:03.501]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.241 --> 02:18:11.662]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.563 --> 02:18:19.544]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.064 --> 02:18:23.507]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:23.907 --> 02:18:26.429]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:27.609]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.629 --> 02:18:28.390]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.410 --> 02:18:29.451]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.671 --> 02:18:30.431]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.671 --> 02:18:31.692]  That's what they're after.
[02:18:31.832 --> 02:18:39.998]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:18:40.138 --> 02:18:40.938]  Endgame.
[02:18:41.299 --> 02:18:43.000]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:44.481]  You have been warned.
[02:18:45.319 --> 02:18:51.224]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[02:18:51.325 --> 02:19:02.775]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[02:19:03.195 --> 02:19:04.036]  Here's the story.
[02:19:04.356 --> 02:19:12.204]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[02:19:12.504 --> 02:19:13.585]  And here's the best part.
[02:19:13.665 --> 02:19:14.967]  It's 100% legal.
[02:19:15.367 --> 02:19:21.433]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[02:19:21.773 --> 02:19:22.354]  I think so.
[02:19:45.547 --> 02:19:58.254]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:19:58.674 --> 02:20:05.418]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:20:05.758 --> 02:20:05.998]  We're good.
[02:20:35.578 --> 02:20:38.939]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:20:39.299 --> 02:20:44.641]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:20:45.301 --> 02:20:45.581]  Fact.
[02:20:45.761 --> 02:20:51.683]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:20:51.803 --> 02:20:56.064]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:20:56.144 --> 02:21:03.627]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:21:04.627 --> 02:21:08.668]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:21:08.848 --> 02:21:17.871]  The Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[02:21:17.991 --> 02:21:30.674]  Detoxification works with the Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life for mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[02:21:30.674 --> 02:21:37.837]  A bad situation here when OPEC says the reason for 105 or 106 dollar a barrel oil is the falling value of the dollar and you won't address that issue.
[02:21:58.510 --> 02:22:00.292]  Where do we go to find out who's right?
[02:22:00.712 --> 02:22:05.055]  Well, as he just said, the Treasury Secretary is where you go to talk about the dollar.
[02:22:05.095 --> 02:22:11.380]  It's a long-standing policy that predates this administration, and I'm not going to change it today, but Treasury can talk about it.
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:26.212]  I don't expect you to change it, but I do expect you to be able to say whether OPEC is completely wrong about this, or whether there is at least something to their claim that the dollar is responsible for the high price of oil right now.
[02:22:27.406 --> 02:22:35.409]  Wendell, I'm under strict instructions and have been from the beginning to not talk about the dollar and I'm not going to get fired to satisfy your question.
[02:22:35.509 --> 02:22:36.629]  Alright.
[02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:43.212]  Now that's Dana Perino, White House Press Secretary, the pretty face they put up there as a total puppet.
[02:22:44.032 --> 02:22:51.274]  We don't need Dana Perino in the White House that tells us we're on a recession and we're in a boom economy to tell us that OPEC's telling the truth.
[02:22:52.155 --> 02:22:55.696]  If you're buying fuel in Euros, you're paying less than you were five years ago.
[02:22:56.238 --> 02:22:59.540]  If you're buying them in dollars, you're paying 70% more.
[02:23:00.681 --> 02:23:01.902]  Excuse me, more than double.
[02:23:03.663 --> 02:23:07.846]  I don't know, it was $40 a barrel six, seven years ago, and it's $109 now.
[02:23:07.866 --> 02:23:09.967]  I don't know, what is that, more than double?
[02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:13.690]  I mean, it's like children.
[02:23:13.710 --> 02:23:18.973]  The national media needs the White House to tell them the dollar's devalued, so oil costs more.
[02:23:18.993 --> 02:23:21.495]  I mean, they talk to us like we are
[02:23:22.435 --> 02:23:23.636]  RETARDED CHILDREN!
[02:23:23.676 --> 02:23:28.279]  And I'm not being mean here, that's they talk to us, and I guess we are, Daniel Estelin!
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:37.066]  Well Alex, you know, I was just listening to the comments from the White House Secretary, and it's just amazing the stupidity what that lady was saying.
[02:23:37.106 --> 02:23:47.514]  Now Alex, do you remember the week before Christmas, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the Bank of England, the National Bank of Switzerland, European Central Bank, the Bank of Canada,
[02:23:47.952 --> 02:23:51.193]  They had a coordinated effort to prop up the financial markets.
[02:23:51.233 --> 02:23:57.515]  Now, in three days at the time, they poured in more than a trillion dollars of liquidity into the system.
[02:23:57.855 --> 02:24:09.859]  Now, since then, the United States Federal Reserve has been pouring about 15 billion dollars a week through term auction facility launched on December 17, 2007, if I'm not mistaken.
[02:24:09.879 --> 02:24:11.319]  Now, one of the side effects
[02:24:11.739 --> 02:24:12.460]  I think so.
[02:24:28.937 --> 02:24:30.098]  The financial markets?
[02:24:30.298 --> 02:24:33.439]  Hey, I had the head of shadowstats.com, top economist.
[02:24:33.739 --> 02:24:36.481]  I had the head of the Newark Business School on.
[02:24:36.581 --> 02:24:39.682]  I've had Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist, World Bank on.
[02:24:39.702 --> 02:24:41.523]  Dr. Paul Gregg-Roberts, former head of the Treasury.
[02:24:41.904 --> 02:24:49.347]  They all say that unless things are done and unless they shore up the dollar, we are going to be in a worldwide depression within two years.
[02:24:49.908 --> 02:24:52.309]  Well, you know, I think the depression is going to be much sooner than that.
[02:24:52.329 --> 02:24:54.430]  We're looking at probably about next year or so.
[02:24:54.890 --> 02:25:05.954]  Again, one of the plans that I did see, according to the Bilderberg report from a few years back, is the idea by the end of 2008, early 2009, to have the dollar lose more than 50% of its value.
[02:25:06.274 --> 02:25:09.176]  Well, the dollar has already lost more than 50% of its value.
[02:25:09.456 --> 02:25:18.659]  In fact, in New York yesterday, I saw stores accepting Euros, which is, you know, something unheard of just a few weeks or months or years ago.
[02:25:18.679 --> 02:25:19.920]  Now, the New York Times...
[02:25:21.139 --> 02:25:21.620]  Exactly.
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:32.269]  The New York Times said last week that the current economic bubble is 600% larger than the 2000 bubble, which literally destroyed half of the American economy.
[02:25:32.689 --> 02:25:34.090]  Imagine what we're in for.
[02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:38.454]  Again, Greenspan said that right now the United States' economic growth is zero.
[02:25:38.854 --> 02:25:40.496]  Buffett said we're in a recession.
[02:25:40.876 --> 02:25:43.358]  General Motors, in the last quarter of 2007, is $722 million in the red.
[02:25:48.264 --> 02:26:00.871]  Again, what do we need to do to convince people that there are very powerful men and women behind the curtain who are controlling the lives, the daily existence of hundreds of millions of people around the world?
[02:26:01.131 --> 02:26:02.552]  What else must be done?
[02:26:04.913 --> 02:26:08.016]  Well, this is it, and they have created all the liquidity.
[02:26:08.057 --> 02:26:09.198]  They flooded the global markets.
[02:26:09.218 --> 02:26:10.319]  Their own documents stated.
[02:26:10.359 --> 02:26:11.220]  I want your take on this.
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:12.722]  We'll get back and we're going to calls.
[02:26:13.382 --> 02:26:20.790]  They have a mountain of money they made out of nothing, but then they get our real assets, our homes, our roads, our water districts, our ports.
[02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:24.114]  It's all being handed over right now, and they haven't even begun.
[02:26:24.614 --> 02:26:44.109]  The full implosion, then they've got their martial law grid, their microwave guns, their sound cannons ready, they've hired 26,000 preachers, 23,000 executives, their FBI InfraGard, now more than a half a million truck drivers, school teachers, spies everywhere, San Francisco Chronicle, Houston Chronicle,
[02:26:44.509 --> 02:26:46.010]  Admitting Bush is now a dictator.
[02:26:46.030 --> 02:26:46.831]  FEMA camps.
[02:26:47.091 --> 02:26:51.835]  He'll pass those presidential powers on to Hillary or Obama or McCain, whoever it is.
[02:26:52.175 --> 02:26:52.916]  I mean, it's clear.
[02:26:52.936 --> 02:26:57.119]  They're going to implode things and then come in with martial law, posing as the saviors.
[02:26:57.379 --> 02:27:01.322]  If we bitch too much, they'll set off a nuke or something and say Al Qaeda did it.
[02:27:01.482 --> 02:27:02.583]  We're going into hell on earth.
[02:27:02.603 --> 02:27:03.163]  There's no doubt.
[02:27:03.424 --> 02:27:06.786]  Now, let me give you, you know, just a bit of information before you go to the commercial break.
[02:27:07.026 --> 02:27:10.489]  That key term for the near future, I heard this through the grapevine from my sources,
[02:27:11.025 --> 02:27:17.369]  Human dignity as a central challenge inherent in the phenomenon of global political awakening.
[02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:24.734]  You will hear this term, human dignity, being popped around by the Obamas and the Hillarys and everybody else in the presidential election.
[02:27:24.774 --> 02:27:25.455]  Watch out for it.
[02:27:26.616 --> 02:27:33.600]  I want to get from you what human dignity means, what that spin term means, from Daniel Lester on the other side and your call.
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:34.101]  Stay with us.
[02:27:35.922 --> 02:27:36.822]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.303 --> 02:27:38.804]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.816 --> 02:27:42.718]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.979 --> 02:27:51.802]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:52.083 --> 02:27:57.125]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:27:57.405 --> 02:28:03.789]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[02:28:04.209 --> 02:28:04.569]  I think so.

[02:29:46.491 --> 02:29:50.514]  The national savings rate has plummeted to an all-time low, while household debt is at an all-time high.
[02:29:50.654 --> 02:29:52.676]  The answer is not the creation of more debt.
[02:29:52.876 --> 02:30:06.187]  Using the innovative Interest-Canceling Money Merge Account program, along with existing banking tools, we offer you the power to pay off your mortgage in a fraction of the time and potentially save thousands in interest, all without refinancing an existing mortgage or interrupting your lifestyle.

[02:30:11.491 --> 02:30:16.995]  It is estimated that in just 18 months, our team alone has helped American homeowners get on track to save a half a billion dollars in interest.
[02:30:17.135 --> 02:30:18.195]  Agents are standing by.

[02:31:09.465 --> 02:31:10.206]  No problem, sir.
[02:31:10.246 --> 02:31:14.169]  What we're doing is heading in the north-westerly direction.
[02:31:14.229 --> 02:31:16.991]  We'd like to establish on the inbound radio a 084 towards Wallasea.
[02:31:17.011 --> 02:31:18.072]  Climb to 2,500 feet.
[02:31:18.132 --> 02:31:20.494]  And then we will advise you of our intentions.
[02:31:32.339 --> 02:31:45.226]  Alright, that is a real mayday call over Manchester, England, where the big jumbo jet takes off and its engine burns out.
[02:31:45.246 --> 02:31:49.908]  You see it on fire and they're calmly calling mayday as they try to turn the plane around and bring it in.
[02:31:50.749 --> 02:31:56.652]  The point is, this is like a country that's basically coming in for a landing with engines on fire.
[02:31:57.449 --> 02:32:00.191]  And the yuppies are dancing around, giggling and snickering.
[02:32:00.231 --> 02:32:07.335]  We have all the government documents, how they're imploding us, how they're going to regulate us, how they're going to control us, the martial law, the FEMA camps.
[02:32:07.895 --> 02:32:12.238]  And I just want to tell all the yuppies and know-it-alls and trendies and the rest of you, this is real.
[02:32:13.018 --> 02:32:13.919]  This isn't a joke.
[02:32:14.359 --> 02:32:15.379]  I wish this wasn't real.
[02:32:15.419 --> 02:32:16.660]  I'm freaked out every day.
[02:32:16.680 --> 02:32:18.781]  I don't even know what to do.
[02:32:19.902 --> 02:32:21.983]  And the globalists are doing this all by design.
[02:32:22.323 --> 02:32:23.164]  They've engineered it all.
[02:32:24.176 --> 02:32:28.180]  And meanwhile, they're telling you everything's fine, so you can't even get ready for it.
[02:32:28.200 --> 02:32:29.561]  They're telling you, go into more debt.
[02:32:29.801 --> 02:32:30.942]  They're saying, issue more debt.
[02:32:31.582 --> 02:32:33.524]  Knowing that means they'll get full control of you.
[02:32:33.564 --> 02:32:35.906]  Daniel Estlin, finishing up the point you were making before break.
[02:32:36.527 --> 02:32:38.068]  Yeah, well, you know, absolutely, Alex.
[02:32:38.208 --> 02:32:41.331]  Again, going back to what you just said, you and I have talked about this quite often.
[02:32:41.711 --> 02:32:48.837]  I think the idea is, you know, I wrestle with this on a daily basis when I face a situation of, who do I tell what's going on in the entire world?
[02:32:49.037 --> 02:32:51.339]  And, you know, my point is, again, this is like a Titanic.
[02:32:52.506 --> 02:32:53.127]  We're out of time.
[02:32:53.167 --> 02:32:55.728]  There's just simply no time to save the entire world's population.
[02:32:56.029 --> 02:32:58.530]  We have to talk to the people who are willing to listen to us.
[02:32:58.890 --> 02:32:59.911]  At least, that's what I am doing.
[02:32:59.951 --> 02:33:04.353]  Talking to the people who understand, who at least understand in part what is going on.
[02:33:04.514 --> 02:33:05.594]  I forget about the yuppies.
[02:33:05.894 --> 02:33:12.538]  Unfortunately, there's just not enough time, not enough energy, and not enough people who understand, who can follow our example and do what needs to be done.
[02:33:12.898 --> 02:33:14.359]  So, I don't talk to the gallery.
[02:33:14.439 --> 02:33:18.782]  I talk only to the people who want to listen, who want to understand, and this is one of the things
[02:33:19.232 --> 02:33:23.135]  I think it's very important that you and the listeners out there do exactly the same thing.
[02:33:23.435 --> 02:33:31.160]  Forget about the yuppies, forget about wasting your time on people who do not want to believe you, whose scale of values have absolutely nothing to do with ours.
[02:33:31.500 --> 02:33:34.062]  They will perish, as most of the other people in the world.
[02:33:34.382 --> 02:33:35.363]  We need to save ourselves.
[02:33:38.263 --> 02:33:45.087]  Well, by perish, I mean live in a police state, be totally bankrupt and poor, living in a FEMA trailer.
[02:33:45.167 --> 02:33:54.193]  I know the Globals are talking about, in fact we have a Carnegie document here that just came out, where they're calling for a zero carbon output.
[02:33:54.473 --> 02:33:59.336]  Well, humans exhale carbon, and they're saying they're going to force a post-industrial era
[02:34:00.009 --> 02:34:02.130]  And then they admit in their own study, billions will die!
[02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:03.550]  I mean, these people are psychopaths!
[02:34:04.091 --> 02:34:13.354]  Well, of course, yeah, we understand that, but unfortunately, we just didn't... You know, as far as I'm concerned, there's not enough time to try to convince everybody out there that what is actually going on is the truth.
[02:34:13.414 --> 02:34:22.858]  Most people will not believe you, no matter how much effort you and I put into this, because unfortunately, again, the mainstream press has done a fantastic job dumbing down the population.
[02:34:22.898 --> 02:34:29.481]  They will laugh in our faces, and they will not believe anything we say, because, again, their reality of television, mainstream press,
[02:34:30.252 --> 02:34:39.361]  Mainstream radio is very different from your reality and my reality, which is based on hard facts and information and data, which of course we have been able to glean from the man behind the curtain.
[02:34:40.382 --> 02:34:44.346]  I want to go to some phone calls for Daniel Estillan right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:44.766 --> 02:34:47.088]  Wes in Idaho, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:34:47.569 --> 02:34:54.255]  Hello, a question for Daniel, but first a comment to Alex about your use of the term
[02:34:55.771 --> 02:34:59.634]  Vaccines or vaccinations with mercury?
[02:34:59.994 --> 02:35:04.838]  I'm here to tell you that any and all vaccinations are bad.
[02:35:04.878 --> 02:35:07.820]  They've never been proven to be safe or effective.
[02:35:08.996 --> 02:35:23.782]  And that there's foreign animal protein that can change your DNA, it bypasses... No, let me just stop you, because I don't want this to go out on air, that I'm saying vaccines are safe if they don't have thimerosal in them.
[02:35:24.362 --> 02:35:34.526]  I've made the point many times that the word tainted makes it sound like it's accidentally in there, or that it'd be okay if that wasn't in there, and I've said that, or contaminated.
[02:35:34.566 --> 02:35:35.847]  It's not contaminated, it's meant
[02:35:36.287 --> 02:35:41.350]  Well, you suggest, just with the term tainted vaccinations as there are perhaps good vaccinations, I'm here to tell you that all vaccinations are bad.
[02:35:57.898 --> 02:36:02.099]  Well, I'm glad that you know everything, but... I didn't say I know everything.
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:09.162]  I'm saying that the term that you use suggests that there are good vaccinations, and I'm saying there are not.
[02:36:09.282 --> 02:36:10.422]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:36:10.702 --> 02:36:19.265]  I'm not saying that science couldn't, that they didn't properly have a good vaccine, but the people running the vaccine companies are a bunch of eugenicists,
[02:36:20.195 --> 02:36:22.976]  I don't think they'll ever be able to produce a safe vaccination injected in the blood.
[02:36:37.779 --> 02:36:46.043]  You might want to take note there that Norway, Sweden and Denmark are banning mercury amalgam dental fillings.
[02:36:46.123 --> 02:36:53.546]  This comes from an organization called Dental Amalgam Mercury Solutions and I think you should have someone on to talk about it.
[02:36:53.566 --> 02:36:57.268]  But this question to Daniel Estillan coming.
[02:36:58.568 --> 02:37:06.372]  I understand the high court in Spain has struck down Holocaust denial laws and I'd like to hear what you
[02:37:07.296 --> 02:37:08.316]  No, about that.
[02:37:09.297 --> 02:37:12.217]  Well, I think they have, but again, it's still pending in the courts.
[02:37:12.277 --> 02:37:13.058]  It hasn't been struck down.
[02:37:13.078 --> 02:37:14.058]  It's still pending in the courts.
[02:37:14.078 --> 02:37:34.684]  I understand there was a big case and the high court in Spain said this law should not be in effect, that this man that has been charged and jailed and prosecuted and an entire huge library has been taken and destroyed.
[02:37:35.802 --> 02:37:37.143]  We're going to turn that around.
[02:37:37.243 --> 02:37:38.324]  Is that not the case?
[02:37:38.404 --> 02:37:40.746]  I should know the actual guy's name.
[02:37:40.806 --> 02:37:43.008]  Pedro in Spain.
[02:37:43.188 --> 02:37:46.050]  It's still pending in the courts.
[02:37:46.130 --> 02:37:47.831]  It's not a final decision yet.
[02:37:48.792 --> 02:37:49.092]  OK.
[02:37:49.452 --> 02:37:53.215]  I'd appreciate you bringing updates to the list.
[02:37:53.235 --> 02:37:53.595]  OK.
[02:37:53.735 --> 02:37:55.456]  When it's a final decision, I'll let Alex know.
[02:37:57.138 --> 02:37:58.899]  That should do it, I guess.
[02:37:58.939 --> 02:38:00.560]  Go to your next caller there, Alex.
[02:38:30.291 --> 02:38:31.332]  Hey, baby
[02:39:08.707 --> 02:39:09.847]  Gentlemen, we're back live.
[02:39:09.867 --> 02:39:11.448]  Going back to Daniel Estillin.
[02:39:11.608 --> 02:39:13.849]  My ISDN dropped strangely there.
[02:39:13.909 --> 02:39:15.749]  We weren't hooked up on backup, but we're back up.
[02:39:16.129 --> 02:39:16.789]  Sorry about that.
[02:39:16.829 --> 02:39:21.731]  Hooking up from Austin to Minnesota and across the world on satellite sometimes does that.
[02:39:22.111 --> 02:39:23.831]  Going back to Daniel Estillin.
[02:39:23.851 --> 02:39:25.872]  Daniel, I missed the end of that.
[02:39:25.892 --> 02:39:27.332]  Did you have any more comments for that fellow?
[02:39:27.832 --> 02:39:28.473]  No.
[02:39:28.793 --> 02:39:34.975]  Basically, it's still pending on the High Court and the decision should be made between now and the end of May.
[02:39:35.055 --> 02:39:36.515]  And as soon as it is, I'll let you know.
[02:39:37.003 --> 02:39:39.283]  But doesn't that now go up to the higher European court?
[02:39:41.864 --> 02:39:43.464]  Only if they decide to challenge the ruling.
[02:39:44.924 --> 02:39:45.344]  Okay.
[02:39:46.345 --> 02:39:49.665]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Colorado.
[02:39:49.725 --> 02:39:50.545]  Scott, you're on the air.
[02:39:50.565 --> 02:39:52.406]  Hey, Alex?
[02:39:52.666 --> 02:39:53.166]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:39:53.186 --> 02:39:55.166]  Yeah, I just wanted to make a general comment.
[02:39:55.186 --> 02:40:02.247]  I wasn't really commenting on the current speaker, but the last speaker, I think it was Paul Watson, was also talking about the climate changes.
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:20.424]  And one of the things that I try to listen to your show almost every day, and one of the things I never hear or anywhere hear, is not only do our climates change in flux at all times, but our magnetic poles change.
[02:40:20.704 --> 02:40:29.106]  And right now we are at one of the weakest points of polarity in time when it does change back and forth.
[02:40:29.722 --> 02:40:31.943]  And it doesn't change back and forth consistently.
[02:40:31.963 --> 02:40:33.084]  You know, that's a good question.
[02:40:33.144 --> 02:40:42.830]  I'm always hearing from people about magnetic poles, or even the axis of the Earth, and now the Earth is actually sped up, and it's spinning a second or so.
[02:40:43.770 --> 02:40:45.792]  And I'm always hearing the elites are concerned about that.
[02:40:45.932 --> 02:40:48.073]  Are the elites... Have you ever heard any of that from Bilderberg?
[02:40:48.673 --> 02:40:49.634]  No, I personally haven't.
[02:40:49.674 --> 02:40:53.256]  I don't know very much about it, so I was kind of curious to see what you had to say.
[02:40:53.296 --> 02:40:54.837]  No, I don't know very much about this, Alex.
[02:40:55.882 --> 02:40:56.383]  I don't either.
[02:40:56.563 --> 02:40:58.164]  Anything else, Scott?
[02:40:58.464 --> 02:40:59.926]  Again, just another general comment.
[02:40:59.946 --> 02:41:05.290]  I had called you on Sunday in reference to a YouTube that I had put up, and it's gotten great response.
[02:41:05.310 --> 02:41:08.993]  The one for the Colorado Springs... Fire Department.
[02:41:09.073 --> 02:41:11.155]  Fire Department grill and posse kamikaze.
[02:41:13.097 --> 02:41:14.578]  Now let me just boil this down and make it simple.
[02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:22.951]  They have drills that seem reasonable for chemical-biological attack to get the police merged with the military, and then next it's let's hunt down the militia.
[02:41:23.211 --> 02:41:29.396]  So it's about creating the relationship, seems reasonable at first, just to get the military with the police.
[02:41:29.416 --> 02:41:29.756]  Go ahead.
[02:41:30.897 --> 02:41:41.345]  Yeah, I was just going to say that if you try to pull it up now with my, with that tagline, Colorado Springs Fire Department, Ussee Comitatus, it just pulls that up
[02:41:41.798 --> 02:41:45.800]  And it won't, it doesn't play the video, it just, the screen is blank.
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:47.842]  I'm just wondering, has that happened to you before?
[02:41:47.862 --> 02:41:50.763]  Uh, yeah, YouTube plays a lot of games.
[02:41:50.803 --> 02:41:51.644]  Thanks for the call here.
[02:41:52.384 --> 02:41:59.108]  I would like to get some calls for Daniel Estlin, 1-800-259-9231, about the New World Order, the Bilderberg Group, and the rest of it.
[02:41:59.669 --> 02:42:01.730]  Uh, Ken in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:03.851]  Are you there?
[02:42:04.151 --> 02:42:05.032]  Yeah, we sure are.
[02:42:11.246 --> 02:42:16.090]  Well, part of my call was something that just came off CNN, and then I got a question for Daniel.
[02:42:16.410 --> 02:42:25.798]  They just announced that the House of Representatives is considering putting steel into pennies and nickels because it costs twice as much to make pennies from nickels as they're worth.
[02:42:27.505 --> 02:42:34.348]  Well, they've already turned them into basically tinfoil, you know, tin, junk with a silver colored wash on them.
[02:42:34.808 --> 02:42:45.174]  You know, growing up, we traveled to Mexico and everybody knew Mexico was bankrupt in third world because they had a devalued currency, so their money looked like trash and was trash, and we're trash now, we're third world, and that's how it is.
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:57.463]  What happened, I think it's been in just the past few years, of Russia's use of the double-headed eagle as a symbol.
[02:42:57.903 --> 02:43:05.885]  I looked up double-headed eagle on Wikipedia, and I mean, it's considered a symbol of the Byzantine Empire, the Holy Roman Empire.
[02:43:05.905 --> 02:43:09.586]  It was on the cover of Albert Pike's Moral and Dogma.
[02:43:10.267 --> 02:43:17.869]  And then when I was in Buenos Aires this past summer,
[02:43:18.792 --> 02:43:19.434]  I don't think so.
[02:43:28.929 --> 02:43:34.713]  Well, I mean, the double-headed eagle has been popular since Rome.
[02:43:34.753 --> 02:43:39.616]  When Rome split into two empires, an eastern and a western empire, that became its symbol.
[02:43:40.037 --> 02:43:41.958]  But eagles... Okay, go ahead.
[02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:43.579]  But what did it mean?
[02:43:44.339 --> 02:43:45.760]  What did it symbolize for Russia?
[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:54.426]  Or what should we, you know... It's eastern and western empire because it went from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.
[02:43:54.466 --> 02:43:54.826]  Daniel?
[02:43:55.307 --> 02:43:55.887]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:43:55.907 --> 02:43:58.389]  And also what Russia today has adopted
[02:43:58.829 --> 02:44:01.131]  Yeah, they've just taken the old flag and the old symbol back.
[02:44:01.151 --> 02:44:01.311]  Exactly.
[02:44:01.371 --> 02:44:06.316]  Hope that answers your question, but yes, it goes back to Rome and when they had an Eastern and Western Empire.
[02:44:17.953 --> 02:44:21.935]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Frank in D.C.
[02:44:21.975 --> 02:44:22.876]  You're on the air, Frank.
[02:44:23.196 --> 02:44:23.536]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:23.576 --> 02:44:23.996]  Great job.
[02:44:24.016 --> 02:44:24.637]  Keep up the good work.
[02:44:24.777 --> 02:44:25.097]  Thank you.
[02:44:25.117 --> 02:44:31.140]  Wouldn't you agree that a new world order is not going to have to have an international-style 9-1-1 with their guns across, probably from mini-nukes?
[02:44:32.841 --> 02:44:37.643]  Well, yeah, I do believe the globalists are going to stage more terror attacks and blame it on al-Qaeda.
[02:44:37.943 --> 02:44:39.124]  Let's get a comment from Daniel.
[02:44:39.144 --> 02:44:39.444]  Daniel?
[02:44:39.624 --> 02:44:46.027]  Well, actually, I'm getting reports from my source, and again, I have to be very careful how I phrase these things because people do seem to lose their head over comments.
[02:44:47.749 --> 02:44:53.552]  I'm getting reports that the next big terrorist nuclear attack is going to be staged in Israel.
[02:44:53.832 --> 02:44:54.753]  Now, that's all I know for now.
[02:44:54.793 --> 02:44:55.593]  I don't know anything else.
[02:44:56.073 --> 02:44:59.955]  But again, if that's the case, and if that actually goes down, we're in some deep trouble.
[02:45:01.696 --> 02:45:07.159]  Because Israel's going to nuke Syria, they're going to nuke Iran, they're going to nuke who else?
[02:45:07.179 --> 02:45:10.441]  Well, you're going to have a regional war, so the first thing, from what I understand,
[02:45:11.465 --> 02:45:18.090]  They're going to detonate a nuclear war in Israel, and as a consequence of that, they're going to have a regional war, which may lead to the Third World War.
[02:45:21.172 --> 02:45:25.595]  And from your intel, are they saying who's going to be selling off the goody?
[02:45:26.656 --> 02:45:34.181]  No, I'm not getting enough information to comment on it, but what I do know is that, this is all I've been told, is that they're extremely concerned about this possibility.
[02:45:35.182 --> 02:45:36.763]  And we are talking near future, Alex.
[02:45:38.743 --> 02:45:41.247]  Well, they need something to get their war against Iran going.
[02:45:41.768 --> 02:45:43.872]  Let's just say the 9-11 wasn't the end of it.
[02:45:45.194 --> 02:45:45.394]  Yeah.
[02:45:46.015 --> 02:45:47.979]  Okay, uh, does that answer your question, Frank?
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:50.503]  Yeah, what if they fell, though, into exposing themselves?
[02:45:51.585 --> 02:45:52.066]  Say that again?
[02:45:52.603 --> 02:45:56.845]  If they pull one of these attacks that doesn't go according to plan, won't they be exposing themselves?
[02:45:56.885 --> 02:45:57.706]  Well, a nuke's easy.
[02:45:57.726 --> 02:46:09.652]  You just pull a truck up, and then you show some video of Muslims being in the area, just stage it, and then, you know, it's pretty easy to cover up a nuke as long as the isotopes can't be tracked back to your government.
[02:46:09.932 --> 02:46:10.232]  Daniel?
[02:46:10.553 --> 02:46:11.173]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:46:11.333 --> 02:46:11.833]  You just said it.
[02:46:12.814 --> 02:46:14.195]  Okay, Frank, thanks for the call.
[02:46:14.295 --> 02:46:15.455]  Vernon in New York.
[02:46:15.495 --> 02:46:16.856]  You're on the air with Daniel Esterman.
[02:46:17.816 --> 02:46:17.997]  Hello?
[02:46:18.477 --> 02:46:18.617]  Yes.
[02:46:19.834 --> 02:46:23.955]  Yes, I would like to get a comment from both you and your guest, Efron.
[02:46:24.475 --> 02:46:26.316]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:46:26.416 --> 02:46:38.079]  I had a thought, and it is related to the endgame, as well as the least possible strategy with the genetically modified foods.
[02:46:38.559 --> 02:46:38.940]  Okay.
[02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:47.402]  And that is, could it also be, obviously the short-term strategy is, you know, to make profits and then to have, you know,
[02:46:48.351 --> 02:46:49.032]  We're good to go.
[02:47:02.997 --> 02:47:14.603]  Oh no, that's even their arguments, that as they pollute things, they'll then have the solutions to the diseases and crises and nanotech problems that they created.
[02:47:15.203 --> 02:47:17.804]  Daniel, in a nutshell, what's their plan with the GMO food?
[02:47:18.225 --> 02:47:20.125]  Well, again, I think people have to understand that.
[02:47:20.346 --> 02:47:29.510]  Genetically modified crop, the green revolution, that was a brilliant Rockefeller family scheme to develop a globalized agribusiness, which then they could monopolize
[02:47:29.992 --> 02:47:33.554]  Just as I have done in the world of oil industry beginning a half century before.
[02:47:33.834 --> 02:47:36.295]  You know what Henry Kissinger said in the 1970s?
[02:47:36.355 --> 02:47:38.236]  If you control the oil, you control the country.
[02:47:38.256 --> 02:47:40.817]  And if you control the food, you control the population.
[02:47:41.097 --> 02:47:42.798]  And that's actually what we're seeing right now.
[02:47:44.118 --> 02:47:49.600]  And that's why these plants take over similar subspecies and then make it to where they can't reproduce.
[02:47:50.041 --> 02:47:55.463]  And Monsanto in 99 publicly said that we're going to contaminate everything so you don't have a choice and then we own everything.
[02:47:56.147 --> 02:47:57.828]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:47:57.848 --> 02:48:16.174]  You know, one of the other side effects of the Green Revolution and the Monsanto Revolution is all this is accompanied by large irrigation projects, which often include World Bank loans to construct huge new dams and flood previously settled areas and fertile farmland in the process.
[02:48:16.515 --> 02:48:22.977]  And of course, fertilizer is an oil-based product, and oil-based products make a lot of money for the world elite.
[02:48:24.304 --> 02:48:26.725]  We'll be right back with Daniel Esselin in the final segment.
[02:48:26.765 --> 02:48:28.605]  He's in the United States in New York right now.
[02:48:28.625 --> 02:48:30.906]  Going to have events out in Portland and other cities.
[02:48:30.926 --> 02:48:34.587]  You can find out more at DanielEsselin.com or TrineDay.com.
[02:48:34.607 --> 02:48:35.247]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:36.548 --> 02:48:41.069]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:41.189 --> 02:48:44.510]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.473 --> 02:48:55.656]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:55.696 --> 02:48:57.116]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:57.416 --> 02:49:00.418]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:49:00.978 --> 02:49:03.419]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:11.603]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.505 --> 02:49:19.467]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.967 --> 02:49:23.409]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.809 --> 02:49:26.331]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:49:26.371 --> 02:49:27.532]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.552 --> 02:49:28.312]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.332 --> 02:49:29.393]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.593 --> 02:49:30.333]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.594 --> 02:49:31.614]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:31.734 --> 02:49:39.919]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:40.059 --> 02:49:43.041]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.241 --> 02:49:44.382]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.387 --> 02:49:49.648]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:49:49.908 --> 02:49:54.810]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:49:55.010 --> 02:49:56.330]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:59.871]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?
[02:50:00.111 --> 02:50:05.272]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[02:50:05.532 --> 02:50:11.294]  Marty Schachter founded Cal Bend's soap company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[02:50:11.634 --> 02:50:14.076]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[02:50:14.156 --> 02:50:16.478]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[02:50:16.678 --> 02:50:18.840]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:20.061]  No harsh chemicals.
[02:50:20.301 --> 02:50:21.222]  No animal testing.
[02:50:21.502 --> 02:50:22.803]  I use them and love them.
[02:50:22.823 --> 02:50:24.425]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:50:24.705 --> 02:50:25.846]  And I save big time.
[02:50:26.126 --> 02:50:27.727]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:50:27.847 --> 02:50:28.188]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:50:37.595 --> 02:50:44.159]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:45.700]  It's a fact.
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:53.385]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:50:53.505 --> 02:51:02.351]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:51:02.631 --> 02:51:13.194]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecure debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:51:13.434 --> 02:51:19.456]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:51:19.716 --> 02:51:24.741]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:51:24.921 --> 02:51:29.405]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn more life around.
[02:51:29.566 --> 02:51:31.367]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:51:31.427 --> 02:51:31.608]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:51:31.628 --> 02:51:31.988]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:51:32.008 --> 02:51:33.349]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:51:33.369 --> 02:51:34.030]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[02:51:54.146 --> 02:52:05.433]  All right, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:07.714 --> 02:52:08.474]  Final segment.
[02:52:08.514 --> 02:52:15.639]  Daniel, real fast, throw out where you're going to be and when here in the United States for your speaking engagements and book signings.
[02:52:16.224 --> 02:52:18.488]  I'm in New York today, and tomorrow we're leaving.
[02:52:18.508 --> 02:52:19.530]  We're going to Portland.
[02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:21.293]  I'm going to be in Portland until the 16th.
[02:52:21.674 --> 02:52:27.183]  We have a big act on a Friday, which is I think the 14th, and another one on the 15th.
[02:52:28.643 --> 02:52:30.764]  Then we're off to Los Angeles 16th through the 19th.
[02:52:30.804 --> 02:52:34.346]  We'll have a big press conference there to announce a couple of exciting things.
[02:52:34.446 --> 02:52:41.290]  One of them is the true story of the Bilderberg Group is going to be made into a Hollywood movie by an independent company.
[02:52:41.690 --> 02:52:44.151]  Obviously no big studio will touch this thing with a 10-foot pole.
[02:52:44.492 --> 02:52:47.073]  So some exciting news and let's see actually what goes down.
[02:52:47.493 --> 02:52:49.474]  The Bilderberg Conference is just around the corner.
[02:52:49.494 --> 02:52:51.215]  That's going to be May, early June.
[02:52:51.575 --> 02:52:52.536]  Of course I'm going to be there.
[02:52:53.261 --> 02:53:00.085]  And I think we can still win this war if we can just get enough people on our side.
[02:53:00.125 --> 02:53:07.590]  Well, you know, I never brought that up, but a film crew, the Independent Film Channel, who I think are there, aren't they videotaping your interview with me today?
[02:53:07.630 --> 02:53:08.610]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:53:08.631 --> 02:53:09.511]  They're here with me.
[02:53:09.751 --> 02:53:18.537]  They were telling me they heard through the grapevine about a pretty good size filmmaker group, I'm going from memory, was going to make a film about your story.
[02:53:18.757 --> 02:53:22.019]  Well, these are the people who are making Terminator 4.
[02:53:22.955 --> 02:53:32.958]  So obviously I have enough money to put this whole thing together and obviously looking forward to this because I think it will expose the Bilderbergers even more, bring the truth into the spotlight, which obviously these people hate.
[02:53:34.278 --> 02:53:35.798]  Yeah, it's going to be exciting, Daniel.
[02:53:36.579 --> 02:53:38.739]  I can't wait to go eat some popcorn and watch it.
[02:53:38.779 --> 02:53:43.400]  Well, you know, I tell you one thing, you know, these guys told me that Discovery Channel was with you the other day.
[02:53:43.421 --> 02:53:45.701]  You know, these people are following me around today.
[02:53:45.741 --> 02:53:48.862]  We have Hollywood interested in some of the stuff that I'm doing for the film.
[02:53:49.266 --> 02:54:04.814]  You know there's enough stuff out there getting out for people actually to be able to see another side to the story and if we can just get enough people on our side thinking, that's what my book does and that's what your video does, it gets people thinking on their own and that's one of the things
[02:54:05.094 --> 02:54:06.195]  We're basically out of time.
[02:54:06.215 --> 02:54:07.355]  I hope you will get
[02:54:30.822 --> 02:54:33.603]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group from InfoWars.com.
[02:54:33.643 --> 02:54:35.304]  It's massively discounted.

[02:54:41.727 --> 02:54:47.429]  Don't forget we have the GMO trilogy, two films and an audio CD for $19.95 in one box set.
[02:54:47.909 --> 02:54:49.810]  People went crazy for that yesterday and that's good.
[02:54:49.830 --> 02:54:50.911]  We need to get this out to people.
[02:54:50.931 --> 02:54:53.452]  They also have the two books on the GMO foods.
[02:54:53.492 --> 02:54:54.632]  This is a real crisis.
[02:54:54.953 --> 02:54:56.333]  We've got to get control of our lives.
[02:54:56.433 --> 02:54:57.154]  We can do it.
[02:54:57.574 --> 02:54:59.595]  That's also available at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:03.052 --> 02:55:20.701]  Also, we've got to get our bodies cleaned out, and Aloe Vera, I've seen all the big studies on it, really cleans out your intestines, your entire digestional tract, and this Aloe Ease Body Cleanse is something I'm taking, the office is taking, it's really good stuff.
