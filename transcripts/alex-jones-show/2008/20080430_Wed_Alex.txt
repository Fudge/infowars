[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.490]  I don't know.
[00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:22.085]  We are now into the fourth and final hour today on this Wednesday edition.
[00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:29.738]  Richard C. Cook is our guest analyst for NASA, for the Kennedy, for the Carter White House.
[00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:34.583]  Worked in a lot of other areas, U.S.
[00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:47.129]  Treasury Department, on and on and on, expert in monetary reform, talking about the collapse of the economy, how it's being done by design, bringing us into a neo-serfdom or feudalism, a North Korean-style state.
[00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:56.273]  He had just gotten to the point of the central bank financiers bringing down Russia by publicly, the Bank of England and others, and Brooklyn, shipping in thousands of Brooklyners
[00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:03.677]  To bring down the czars, not for the utopic communism, but for a banker utopia of slaves.
[00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:05.277]  Please continue, Mr. Cook.
[00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:23.025]  Well, and then you had over on the American side, you had of course the Federal Reserve system coming into being when the bankers took over the United States economy in 1913, and of course coming along with that was the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, where you instituted the income tax.
[00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.895]  The purpose of the income tax was to pay the interest on the permanent national debt.
[00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:49.268]  Now, I want to jump ahead because during the subsequent decades, while the United States was being harnessed as the financier's military enforcer for the world, there was actually a significant power struggle within the United States between the forces that wanted to have a strong nation, a strong national economy,
[00:01:49.961 --> 00:02:01.307]  And this was primarily the program of the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, but Roosevelt was very ambiguous about it, and he allowed the banking system to continue to function.
[00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:12.874]  And it was after World War II, when the American economy began to decline through the tremendous deficits that were being run up during the Vietnam War,
[00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:21.617]  That the United States began to fall back into the control of the international financial world.
[00:02:23.478 --> 00:02:29.099]  By the late 1960s, the Vietnam War was sinking the United States deeper into debt.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.442]  The problem at that time was made worse by very heavy federal expenditures under social programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:41.023]  But when Nixon became president,
[00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:52.510]  His Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, came up with a plan where Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC nations would gradually increase the price of oil.
[00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.511]  And the profits for that were going to be used for the oil-producing nations to buy debt from the U.S.
[00:02:59.551 --> 00:02:59.991]  Treasury.
[00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.673]  In other words, this is what we were going to do with our deficit from that point on.
[00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:11.034]  It was going to be sold overseas to other countries, particularly the OPEC oil-producing nations.
[00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:22.910]  That's why, over the decade of the 70s, by 1980, the cost of oil had been ratcheted up from $3.50 a barrel to $39.50 a barrel.
[00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.671]  And that's really a global program.
[00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:26.492]  That's really a covert global tax.
[00:03:26.932 --> 00:03:27.532]  It's a tax.
[00:03:27.572 --> 00:03:31.674]  It was a de facto tax on the economy, and the plan worked.
[00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:39.899]  The petrodollar and dollar hegemony were born, and the dollar at that point became the world's reserve currency.
[00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:52.213]  The dollars could flood the world only because in 1971, the Nixon administration abandoned the dollar's gold peg as a basis for international currency exchange.
[00:03:52.974 --> 00:04:02.542]  Now, currencies could float freely in the world markets, and so you had a tremendous period of currency speculation and worldwide inflation.
[00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:06.346]  From this point on, the bankers were in control.
[00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:07.667]  The economies of the world
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.860]  We're good to go.
[00:04:30.993 --> 00:04:32.613]  And they now, we've got a break again.
[00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:33.974]  We've got a break again, sir.
[00:04:34.394 --> 00:04:36.894]  So now they've got reality out of the equation.
[00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:39.935]  They can flood everything with their fiat and get real assets.
[00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:44.316]  And the last little bit we've got will be taken by the nice men in black uniforms.
[00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:47.036]  It's all about monopoly of control.
[00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:50.957]  You're to have nothing but your Prozac.
[00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.237]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:58.059]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.139]  A new world order.
[00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:05.147]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:05.787 --> 00:05:07.548]  It's known as the Builderberg.
[00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:10.849]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.830]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.893]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:29.884]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:33.827]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:33.987 --> 00:05:36.729]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:37.950]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.730]  They're not after money.
[00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.831]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:40.752]  They're after power.
[00:05:41.012 --> 00:05:41.852]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.721]  You have been warned.
[00:05:55.962 --> 00:05:58.823]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:06.467]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[00:06:07.051 --> 00:06:14.293]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now!
[00:06:14.893 --> 00:06:21.215]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[00:06:21.795 --> 00:06:28.277]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:06:28.577 --> 00:06:30.858]  Beware, be smart and be ready!
[00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:32.238]  We're good to go!
[00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:56.703]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[00:06:56.923 --> 00:07:00.446]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:06.531]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[00:07:06.652 --> 00:07:10.415]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:15.219]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.841]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems
[00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:19.942]  First, church and state must be kept separate.
[00:07:20.142 --> 00:07:23.884]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:26.605]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[00:07:26.786 --> 00:07:31.908]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[00:07:32.088 --> 00:07:35.470]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.392]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[00:07:38.552 --> 00:07:41.093]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[00:07:41.313 --> 00:07:43.014]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.575]  Jesus is coming soon!

[00:07:53.462 --> 00:08:01.908]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:17.740]  Richard C. Cook, White House Analyst Advisor, Syndicative Columnist, analyzing what's happening to the economy.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:28.765]  Please continue with the history of the private owners of all of us, who just so happen to be psychopathic eugenicists and say they want to get rid of us, and who happen to control our police.
[00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:29.725]  Please continue.
[00:08:30.325 --> 00:08:31.466]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:38.569]  Let me just mention my email address again for people who want to write in with questions or support what we're doing.
[00:08:39.512 --> 00:08:43.115]  It's economicsanityatgmail.com.
[00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:46.558]  Would you like in the hour we've got left later to take some phone calls?
[00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.059]  Yeah, I think we could do that, yeah.
[00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:50.120]  Okay, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231, or the local studio number, 512-646-5400.
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.002]  We'll do that though later, go ahead.
[00:08:52.162 --> 00:08:55.504]  Okay, yeah, I want to continue doing some of the historical background here and try to get to some of
[00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:09.491]  Uh, the solutions that we might want to take a look at for all of this.
[00:09:10.252 --> 00:09:22.199]  Uh, we talked about the 1971, uh, milestone where the dollar peg to gold was removed and that allowed the currencies of the world to float against each other and brought in this huge era of speculation.
[00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:29.223]  And it also allowed the petrodollar to come into being where the OPEC nations and Saudi Arabia and the others.
[00:09:29.783 --> 00:09:31.885]  Now we're going to purchase U.S.
[00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:35.727]  Treasury securities, uh, and run up the price of oil to pay for those.
[00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:42.479]  This plan was really the plan of the Secretary of State under Nixon, Henry Kissinger.
[00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:46.240]  And another thing that it did, it made the U.S.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.082]  dependent on Middle Eastern oil, and turned the U.S.
[00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:59.006]  into the power behind the financiers' ambition to dominate the region, particularly through working with the nation of Israel.
[00:10:00.006 --> 00:10:04.208]  So now, the United States, which had liberated Europe from the Nazis,
[00:10:05.077 --> 00:10:18.140]  We also began to be the ones who were going to fight and die for the financiers in the Middle East, and of course, the final conquest of Iraq starting in 2003 and the planned war against Iran are phases of that.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:30.582]  Now, meanwhile, back here in the United States, through the financiers' control of the Federal Reserve System, the producing economy was wrecked through the Fed-induced recession of 1979 to 1983.
[00:10:33.737 --> 00:10:45.206]  Now that's when Volcker raised interest rates to the highest in history to combat the inflation which the financiers themselves had caused through the oil price shocks.
[00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:50.970]  Then, when Clinton was elected president in 1992, the U.S.
[00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:58.816]  producing economy, which had been devastated by the shutdown of the factories and the export of jobs under Reagan and the first Bush,
[00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:14.175]  Well, the work of Wrecking the Economy was completed by Clinton's embrace of NAFTA, which has largely eliminated family farming in favor of financier-controlled agribusiness in North America, throughout U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
[00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:23.901]  And, of course, the deregulation of the financial industry, which had begun in a big way during the Reagan and Bush years, was accelerated under Clinton.
[00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:25.062]  Now,
[00:11:25.683 --> 00:11:28.765]  By this time, the only thing that was floating the U.S.
[00:11:28.805 --> 00:11:30.247]  economy were the bubbles.
[00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:36.291]  You had the merger-acquisition bubble of the 80s, and that ended in the George H.W.
[00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:40.795]  Bush recession that brought Clinton into the presidency in 92.
[00:11:41.775 --> 00:11:48.020]  Then during the 90s, you had the dot-com bubble that was fueled not by American savings, but by foreign investment.
[00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:55.326]  And it was the capital gains on these stock price inflations and counting trust funds like Social Security
[00:11:56.207 --> 00:12:05.372]  As part of budgetary assets in the federal budget that allowed Clinton to balance the federal budget during the last three years of his presidency.
[00:12:05.452 --> 00:12:10.695]  But it all ended, as we know, when the dot-com bubble burst in the crash of 2000 and 2001.
[00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:22.661]  And Americans lost in that crash $7 trillion of wealth, including the pension funds of hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:23.762]  Now,
[00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:31.316]  After that came along the Bush bubbles, because Bush, as you know, did not attempt to rebuild the economy.
[00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:51.052]  What he did was cut income taxes to the highest tax brackets and allow Alan Greenspan to create the housing bubble, followed by the equity fund bubble, the commercial real estate bubble, the hedge fund bubble, and all of that is what now is coming to a head and is starting to deflate
[00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.832]  Well, ruining the economic viability of the nation.
[00:12:55.753 --> 00:13:00.876]  After this, the only bubbles that are left are the ones that we're seeing so clearly out there right now.
[00:13:01.576 --> 00:13:03.357]  Those are the food and fuel bubbles.
[00:13:04.038 --> 00:13:10.402]  And these are the ones that, when they go down, are going to take the livelihood of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people with it.
[00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:14.004]  And I would call those hyper-predatory bubbles.
[00:13:14.404 --> 00:13:15.085]  That's correct.
[00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:18.247]  That's all that's left, because the producing economy
[00:13:18.677 --> 00:13:20.157]  I can't support the nation anymore.
[00:13:20.177 --> 00:13:23.238]  There's nothing left, and these are the last bubbles.
[00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:26.799]  This is the predatory system.
[00:13:26.859 --> 00:13:28.899]  This is the cannibalistic system.
[00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:30.240]  And that's what they've stated.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:39.802]  All that's left is war, military, cops, checkpoints, cameras, and it's... I just can't believe this once great nation is just going to be... Oh my God.
[00:13:39.942 --> 00:13:42.082]  But the people are waking up now like never before.
[00:13:42.102 --> 00:13:43.963]  I don't know if they're going to get away with it.
[00:13:43.983 --> 00:13:45.803]  I mean, this hellish thing they plan to set up.
[00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:55.179]  Well, if we can, what I'd like to do is go through some of what I think are the solutions that we have to start working with.
[00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:59.830]  Okay, solutions are great, and I want to take some time to talk about solutions.
[00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.630]  We did that yesterday with G. Edward Griffin.
[00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:10.412]  My issue here is that the establishment has electronic voting machines that engage in fraud in most of the country.
[00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:15.652]  We know that the government, the CIA, runs the big three electronic companies.
[00:14:15.692 --> 00:14:19.693]  We know they're ignoring, I mean, 91% want to control the borders, they say no.
[00:14:19.853 --> 00:14:20.413]  Gallup poll.
[00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.954]  Eighty-something percent want to end the war, they say no, it never ends.
[00:14:24.694 --> 00:14:27.475]  They just do what they want, when they want, how they want.
[00:14:27.956 --> 00:14:32.618]  So, it's good to know what monetary solutions are, and I agree with a lot of your ideas.
[00:14:32.638 --> 00:14:34.659]  A lot of other experts I interview do as well.
[00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:52.027]  It's just that, I guess it's important to know who to blame, so that as they implode things, I think the solution is, first off, people need to know this was done by design, or the same people that did this will always offer a new solution to the problem they created, which is greater control for them.
[00:14:52.907 --> 00:14:56.608]  Well, that's certainly correct, and you can see that in the presidential campaigns.
[00:14:57.109 --> 00:14:57.889]  You can see that.
[00:14:58.929 --> 00:15:03.911]  You can't see it so much in the McCain campaign, because John McCain says everything is just great as it is.
[00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:21.117]  But when you get into the solutions being offered by Hillary Clinton, for example, and even to some extent Obama, although I don't think Obama is quite as much a part of that establishment as Hillary Clinton is, essentially you're saying, put me back, trust us, and we'll fix it for you.
[00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:25.530]  Well, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.250]  Okay, well let's go ahead and get into the solutions.
[00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:37.772]  I just want to make clear here that they have got us tied down and it's going to be hard to have these solutions, but I just want to be clear about that.
[00:15:38.392 --> 00:15:50.315]  Well, I think that's true, and I guess from my point of view, being someone who's worked in this field, I've tried to get a meeting with Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, and of course have not been granted an audience.
[00:15:51.101 --> 00:15:56.805]  But obviously there has to be a political revolution in order to get people into power.
[00:15:58.318 --> 00:16:02.782]  in the White House who can make a difference and who can bring the reformers in.
[00:16:02.802 --> 00:16:04.423]  But that's the problem.
[00:16:05.044 --> 00:16:07.366]  You would think of the word reformer to fix a problem.
[00:16:07.686 --> 00:16:08.487]  Nothing's broken.
[00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:11.029]  The war on drugs, more drugs are shipped in by them.
[00:16:11.229 --> 00:16:14.111]  They put more of us in their private prisons owned by banks that launder the money.
[00:16:14.612 --> 00:16:15.192]  It's not broken.
[00:16:15.232 --> 00:16:16.513]  The war on terror is not broken.
[00:16:16.713 --> 00:16:18.435]  They mean to stay in Iraq for a hundred years.
[00:16:18.635 --> 00:16:21.878]  They meant to sow seeds of insurrection, divide the country in three parts.
[00:16:22.038 --> 00:16:22.959]  It's been a great plan.
[00:16:23.359 --> 00:16:24.260]  Mission is accomplished.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.261]  When Bush said that, he meant it.
[00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:26.722]  It's just not the mission we were told.
[00:16:27.242 --> 00:16:28.343]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:16:28.743 --> 00:16:31.764]  You know, I understand that there are reforms that can pull us out of this.
[00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.765]  It's not even too late, according to Ron Paul and others.
[00:16:34.725 --> 00:16:38.487]  The problem is, the establishment isn't going to allow that to happen.
[00:16:38.767 --> 00:16:41.649]  They preemptively took over the voting machines in the last 20 years.
[00:16:41.909 --> 00:16:44.510]  They preemptively preplaced and brainwashed police.
[00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:51.153]  I mean, they have premeditatedly been really setting all the dominoes up here for a long time.
[00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:57.189]  Go ahead, I'm not trying to be negative, I'm just trying to let people assess just how serious it is.
[00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:20.727]  I think that's so, yeah, and I certainly would not argue with that, but if anyone has any hope to try to reform anything, I think we need to realize that all of these manifestations that are going on of terror, of state terror, of internal crackdowns, of internal collapse, all of this is happening because
[00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:22.569]  We have a failed economy.
[00:17:23.489 --> 00:17:35.277]  And in order to make any progress or any headway at all into getting out of this situation, the economy of the United States has to be rebuilt from the ground up.
[00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:40.821]  And there are three areas where somebody has got to take responsibility for making changes.
[00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:44.083]  And let me tell you what I think those three areas are.
[00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:50.535]  One is American family farming, because a nation that cannot feed itself cannot exist.
[00:17:50.735 --> 00:17:51.275]  Oh, I agree.
[00:17:52.036 --> 00:17:53.317]  I think we've got to face that.
[00:17:53.557 --> 00:17:54.998]  Get back to self-sufficiency.
[00:17:55.398 --> 00:17:57.840]  Those are things we can take on ourselves, yes.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:06.626]  There has to be the ability for us to be able to feed ourselves within our own boundaries using our own resources, and we can do that.
[00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:11.278]  If we set out to do it, and if we have the policies in place that can accomplish that.
[00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:29.968]  But that's why, so we can have our solution, we've got to block their Real ID, their Animal ID, their Premises ID, which was written by the big AGRA, to shut down family farms and ranches, have inspectors on your land, thousand dollar a day fines for no reason, absolute bureaucracies of little environmental control freaks running around foaming at the mouth.
[00:18:30.428 --> 00:18:32.249]  Yes, yes we do, absolutely.
[00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.691]  And then we've got to rebuild the infrastructure.
[00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:46.800]  The streets, the bridges, the railroad systems, the mass transit systems, and... Continue, sir!
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:58.366]  And along with that, we've got to rebuild the soft services, the health services, and the educational services, and we've got to be able to do that by controlling the monetary system.
[00:18:59.006 --> 00:19:03.449]  So the underlying reform that has to be made is of the monetary system.
[00:19:04.116 --> 00:19:08.179]  And that's what I've been arguing now over the last year and a half.
[00:19:08.819 --> 00:19:10.240]  Let me just mention Ron Paul.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.101]  You brought him up.
[00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:19.947]  He has made history as the first major presidential candidate ever to call for the abolishment of the Federal Reserve.
[00:19:20.267 --> 00:19:22.449]  Yes, we now have those key ideas being introduced.
[00:19:22.689 --> 00:19:26.152]  Yeah, and he's absolutely right, and he's done a great service by doing that.
[00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:33.357]  Because the very first thing that a president who is truly a president of the American people has to do
[00:19:34.232 --> 00:19:34.332]  John,
[00:20:01.829 --> 00:20:02.329]  John Harman.
[00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:03.070]  It is a big idea
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.521]  A New World Order.
[00:20:33.221 --> 00:20:38.303]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[00:20:38.323 --> 00:20:40.284]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:43.126]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:46.187]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:20:46.927 --> 00:20:54.231]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:20:57.259 --> 00:21:02.242]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:02.723 --> 00:21:06.165]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:06.585 --> 00:21:09.067]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:09.147 --> 00:21:10.308]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:10.328 --> 00:21:11.088]  They're not after money.
[00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:12.169]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:12.389 --> 00:21:13.070]  They're after power.
[00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.190]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:21:14.511 --> 00:21:22.736]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:27.059]  You have been warned.
[00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:31.323]  Hey there, this is your radio talking.
[00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:35.207]  Have you noticed how every type of gadget these days requires some specific type of battery?
[00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:37.268]  It doesn't matter what kind of gadget you're using.
[00:21:37.329 --> 00:21:39.330]  We all take different sizes and types of batteries.

[00:22:28.251 --> 00:22:29.932]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:22:30.212 --> 00:22:33.654]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:22:33.834 --> 00:22:35.655]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:22:36.135 --> 00:22:39.016]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:44.799]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:22:45.059 --> 00:22:48.961]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:54.203]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:23:26.377 --> 00:23:27.117]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:35.321]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:23:35.661 --> 00:23:41.282]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:23:41.603 --> 00:23:45.443]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:23:45.743 --> 00:23:50.684]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:23:50.924 --> 00:23:57.066]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionizers.
[00:24:03.247 --> 00:24:04.988]  Richard C. Cook is our guest.
[00:24:05.008 --> 00:24:07.328]  We're going to start taking phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:07.788 --> 00:24:09.769]  We're talking about Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:24:10.389 --> 00:24:14.190]  I have him up on the document cam for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.691]  The fourth hour becomes a television show for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:24:18.751 --> 00:24:22.172]  Also for people to listen to the InfoWars radio internet streams.
[00:24:22.212 --> 00:24:25.733]  We a lot of times do little interviews during the breaks as well.
[00:24:26.673 --> 00:24:32.755]  As we'll do during the next break with Mr. Cook, and we'll come back at the 33 after and start taking some calls in the time we have left.
[00:24:32.775 --> 00:24:34.056]  We'll obviously have to have Mr. Cook back.
[00:24:34.396 --> 00:24:38.318]  Continue with the monetary reform ideas that you have, sir.
[00:24:39.038 --> 00:24:52.203]  Well, let me just mention, I will have an article coming out in the next couple days on global research that will go into what we've been talking about today, Alex, in a lot of detail.
[00:24:52.998 --> 00:25:01.181]  And so people can take a look at that, and also they can write me on economicsanity at gmail dot com with questions that they have.
[00:25:01.241 --> 00:25:12.724]  Now, one thing I also wanted to mention about Ron Paul's candidacy is that it proves, despite what a lot of people say, that the public is ready to listen to new ideas.
[00:25:13.424 --> 00:25:19.086]  But even progressive analysts, including I have to say Ralph Nader,
[00:25:20.035 --> 00:25:31.913]  Uh, who says he's running for president again are so locked into outmoded concepts that they do not understand, they do not realize that a completely new type of monetary system is needed.
[00:25:32.475 --> 00:25:34.617]  To really achieve economic democracy.
[00:25:34.657 --> 00:25:40.961]  Well that's because their strategists tell them the public can't grasp it, and so they just go with sound bites themselves.
[00:25:41.021 --> 00:25:42.623]  That is correct.
[00:25:42.663 --> 00:25:43.663]  It's all very stagnant.
[00:25:43.683 --> 00:25:51.389]  So to break down the monetary system, how do we extricate ourselves first out of their control, abolish the Fed, we have to educate people first, so that's happening.
[00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.632]  Secondarily then, what system do you like?
[00:25:55.272 --> 00:26:01.817]  Being a monetary expert with the Treasury Department, working in the White House, being an analyst for NASA, studying this at the White House level,
[00:26:02.477 --> 00:26:04.378]  What do you and other experts you confer with?
[00:26:04.398 --> 00:26:06.820]  I mean, how would you reverse what we see here?
[00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:15.865]  Let me put out a concept first, very briefly, and then I'll give some specific ideas that I and other monetary reformers are promoting.
[00:26:16.525 --> 00:26:27.431]  The basic concept that must be understood, that people do not understand today, and that I've been writing about now in my writings for the past year and a half, is to look at what is credit.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:37.144]  Credit is a power of nature that is truly part of what we call the human commons, you know, the common heritage of mankind.
[00:26:37.304 --> 00:26:45.748]  Credit allows a society to create value by using the ability that we have to draw
[00:26:48.101 --> 00:26:52.905]  Out of our future productivity into what we can create and use today.
[00:26:52.965 --> 00:26:54.126]  Now that sounds complicated.
[00:26:54.146 --> 00:26:55.207]  It's a form of leveraging.
[00:26:55.607 --> 00:27:00.311]  But what it means is, yes, it's a form of leveraging, but it is a public utility.
[00:27:00.992 --> 00:27:07.657]  It is a public utility as water is a public utility or as electricity is a public utility.
[00:27:08.297 --> 00:27:17.365]  The management of credit should never be given away or privatized to individuals or corporations who manipulate it for profit.
[00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.533]  That's what the banks have done, and it is... Well, they've abused the hell out of it.
[00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:25.596]  I mean, they've abused just the complete daylights out of it.
[00:27:25.616 --> 00:27:26.636]  That's correct.
[00:27:26.716 --> 00:27:37.424]  At every single level, aggressively trying to hurt economies, trying to destroy economies, so they can consolidate as a business model, stated in their own documents.
[00:27:37.745 --> 00:27:46.271]  That is correct, and it's this privatization of credit through the banking systems that has loaded humanity with the tremendous burden of debt
[00:27:47.256 --> 00:28:01.786]  It's made short-term profits the highest priority of everything that's done in the business, and it's made modern industry really as much a curse as it is a blessing, and it's this privatization of credit that has to be changed.
[00:28:01.826 --> 00:28:12.954]  So, I have, and this is work I've done with a lot of other people who are involved in the monetary reform movement around the world, that people really need to become aware of.
[00:28:13.634 --> 00:28:16.356]  There are three things that I'm proposing.
[00:28:17.185 --> 00:28:23.649]  The first is a guaranteed income, which will be accomplished through what we call the National Dividend.
[00:28:23.709 --> 00:28:30.654]  Now you've heard of the Alaska Permanent Fund, where every year, every resident of Alaska is given a stipend.
[00:28:30.814 --> 00:28:35.677]  Yeah, it's the comprehensive annual financial reports that have trillions of dollars off-budget.
[00:28:36.218 --> 00:28:47.085]  And so, absolutely, instead of giving all of this investment capital to offshore corporations, take it back over by the government, and then have it distributed equally to the population.
[00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:47.866]  That's correct.
[00:28:47.926 --> 00:29:05.439]  In my estimate, and this is in a global research article I wrote last year, which is called an Emergency Program of Monetary Reform for the United States, calculates the national dividend where we are right now at $12,000 per capita annually.
[00:29:05.479 --> 00:29:11.404]  Now you can compare that to the $600 per person that Bush is about to send you back on your tax rebate.
[00:29:11.424 --> 00:29:12.385]  What I'm saying is
[00:29:13.171 --> 00:29:16.722]  A national dividend should amount to at least at this point $12,000.
[00:29:18.801 --> 00:29:26.326]  Well, it's an absolute fact.
[00:29:26.426 --> 00:29:29.008]  I made a film about this eight years ago.
[00:29:29.588 --> 00:29:30.509]  Stay there, sir.
[00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:32.830]  We're going to be right back for the main radio listeners.
[00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:40.776]  For InfoWars.com stream listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're going to go live right now for this three minutes and come back and take your calls.
[00:29:41.276 --> 00:29:43.858]  The show continues at InfoWars.com on those streams.
[00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:46.581]  Okay.
[00:29:47.221 --> 00:29:50.282]  Continuing with you, Mr. Cook, continue with your solutions.
[00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.023]  Hello?
[00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:57.404]  Yes, Mr. Cook, we're still on air here with part of the audience.
[00:29:58.084 --> 00:30:00.324]  This is so important, I'm skipping the break here on the web.
[00:30:01.205 --> 00:30:03.805]  Please continue with your monetary solution idea.
[00:30:04.285 --> 00:30:14.948]  Now, one of the things, I just wanted to mention that if people want to do some research on the source of the national dividend idea, the best source is the teachings of C. H. Douglas.
[00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:29.458]  Who was the founder of the social credit movement back in the 1920s and 30s, and I have articles on global research that tells about... By the way, the former auditor of the Air Force looked at all this and called for it about six years ago.
[00:30:31.118 --> 00:30:32.899]  Walter Burian, I'm sure you've heard of him.
[00:30:33.559 --> 00:30:38.940]  He really publicized the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, the double set of books that governments have.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.481]  Can you give us your take on that?
[00:30:41.001 --> 00:30:45.022]  Well, the money is available, but even more than that is that it can be paid out
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:31:15.412]  without having to tax people and without having to borrow money by the federal government because it's part of the productivity of the nation and you can set up a separate national dividend account that is a uh... gives us the ability to monetize the appreciation of the economy and the productivity of the economy as it develops over time and pay out this national dividend without taxing anybody without having to borrow money by the government that's very critical thing
[00:31:15.953 --> 00:31:23.917]  To understand, and if people want to understand more about the theory of that, they can check out my article that's going to be coming out on Global Research.
[00:31:24.617 --> 00:31:38.224]  The second thing is that the government needs to go back to spending money directly into circulation as it did with the Greenbacks in the 19th century, particularly for infrastructure projects at the federal, state, and local levels.
[00:31:38.885 --> 00:31:43.167]  Now, there has been legislation proposed in Congress very recently by
[00:31:44.072 --> 00:31:49.554]  Congressman Kucinich, Senator Dodd, and others to set up a national infrastructure bank.
[00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:56.136]  And this should be done immediately, and you can do it by capitalizing state and local infrastructure bonds.
[00:31:56.296 --> 00:32:00.897]  But that would compete with the globalists taking all that money and buying up our infrastructure.
[00:32:00.937 --> 00:32:01.857]  Yes, it would.
[00:32:01.937 --> 00:32:03.618]  Why shouldn't we just hand everything over to them?
[00:32:03.638 --> 00:32:04.878]  I mean, they're loving private bankers.
[00:32:05.118 --> 00:32:06.899]  Well, this is why they oppose it so much.
[00:32:06.979 --> 00:32:11.060]  This is why every infrastructure project that you see coming out of the establishment
[00:32:13.662 --> 00:32:16.683]  They also use this term over and over again about privatization.
[00:32:17.724 --> 00:32:22.807]  If you have 100 economies and almost 50 of them are corporations, not countries, they're not free market.
[00:32:22.847 --> 00:32:29.171]  They're a bunch of pirates with letters of marque from the New World Order just grabbing up everything with our money.
[00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:30.352]  Yeah, that's correct.
[00:32:30.412 --> 00:32:31.953]  And all of that has to be eliminated.
[00:32:32.073 --> 00:32:35.634]  Okay, we're going to go back live for the main radio audience right now.
[00:32:35.714 --> 00:32:38.555]  RichardCCook.com is the website.
[00:32:38.575 --> 00:32:40.756]  We're going to come back and take some calls right now.
[00:32:40.816 --> 00:32:41.236]  Here we go.
[00:32:42.616 --> 00:32:46.957]  And in fact, John, go ahead and give me some of those callers from the network end.
[00:32:46.977 --> 00:32:49.838]  Alright, so far I have Lance in Minnesota.
[00:32:49.858 --> 00:32:51.098]  Okay.
[00:32:51.479 --> 00:32:53.319]  And then Firis in Georgia.
[00:32:53.479 --> 00:32:54.119]  Both for the guests.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.120]  Here we go.
[00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:24.180]  Listen to me very carefully, people that serve the government.
[00:33:26.081 --> 00:33:32.626]  The sadistic, cold-blooded families that run the New World Order, that own the private banks, that own our governments.
[00:33:34.047 --> 00:33:42.774]  It's all illegitimate, it's done through fraud, but they need a police state apparatus and propaganda to be able to secure it, hold it, and expand it.
[00:33:44.281 --> 00:33:45.561]  And they do this in phases.
[00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:52.504]  If we do not have a renaissance, an awakening to this, an open debate about this, we are going to be hurt very, very badly.
[00:33:52.544 --> 00:33:54.825]  We're already seeing just the leading edge of the storm.
[00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:58.726]  And it gets more and more intense as we get deeper into it.
[00:33:59.406 --> 00:34:02.648]  So I know a lot of you won't listen now, but you'll listen later as it gets harder and harder.
[00:34:03.128 --> 00:34:04.028]  It is in 99.9% of our interest
[00:34:07.165 --> 00:34:08.426]  to not go along with this.
[00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.568]  This is hyper-predatory.
[00:34:11.209 --> 00:34:12.750]  They believe in social Darwinism.
[00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:18.996]  They believe hurting innocent people, killing, enslaving, bankrupting is good for the race.
[00:34:19.456 --> 00:34:20.897]  They believe it's their right to rule.
[00:34:20.917 --> 00:34:21.858]  This is their own statements.
[00:34:22.258 --> 00:34:28.104]  The head of the CFR, Richard Enhance, publicly, they published this, said, the whole global warming thing's fake.
[00:34:28.724 --> 00:34:31.987]  It's all about making humans the enemy in the state-waging war.
[00:34:32.348 --> 00:34:34.530]  It's all about tracking and controlling our every movement.
[00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.432]  It's a new level of bureaucracy.
[00:34:37.253 --> 00:34:39.214]  The war on terror, they admit, is totally fake.
[00:34:39.254 --> 00:34:45.440]  Gary Hart admitted two days ago, just broke up on InfoWars.com, the WeAreChange video, said, yeah, our government stages terror attacks.
[00:34:46.482 --> 00:34:47.623]  Uh, and we'll stage him again.
[00:34:48.284 --> 00:34:49.866]  I mean, it's all happening.
[00:34:49.886 --> 00:34:51.788]  Now Hart helped write the Homeland Security plan.
[00:34:52.068 --> 00:34:53.350]  He called for terror attacks.
[00:34:53.891 --> 00:35:02.001]  Richard C. Cook, why do you think Gary Hart and Zbigniew Brzezinski and others are suddenly coming out and telling Congress and others, hey, our government could stage attacks?
[00:35:02.441 --> 00:35:03.642]  Does that show splits?
[00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:09.964]  Why do we see Rockefeller coming and trying to take Exxon Mobil chairmanship away from Rex Tillerson?
[00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:17.888]  I do see, not fake, because they're not really publicizing it, but I'm seeing real friction within the establishment.
[00:35:18.128 --> 00:35:21.570]  Is this kind of at the moment of truth, really decapitating the U.S.
[00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.070]  and bringing us into this enslavement?
[00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:28.433]  Are some of their people going, come on, this is too dangerous, this is too intense.
[00:35:28.713 --> 00:35:31.034]  They're waking up to us, they're not going to go along with it.
[00:35:31.474 --> 00:35:37.058]  Or is this kind of like the high command that liked Hitler at first, but by 1942 wanted to get rid of him?
[00:35:37.098 --> 00:35:39.319]  I mean, is this some sanity, or what's happening?
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:54.550]  Well, my opinion is that there is some sanity that is creeping in, because a lot of these people like Brzezinski, for example, really believed that they were going to build a strong America, and that America was going to be the nation that ruled the world, and now
[00:35:55.091 --> 00:36:01.835]  America's being dumped in the trash by the international financiers who've used us and abused us and don't need us anymore.
[00:36:01.915 --> 00:36:03.756]  We're being taken down deliberately.
[00:36:04.296 --> 00:36:10.960]  And so I think some of the people who formerly were part of the problem are realizing they've got to be part of the solution.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:20.085]  And I do know, and I can tell you this, having worked in the federal government for 32 years, there are many patriotic Americans who work in the federal government.
[00:36:20.529 --> 00:36:27.570]  You should have heard some of the things that I heard said about Bush, about the Bush administration, about the false terror attacks.
[00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:37.592]  When I was in the government, there are a lot of people, I think, who are ready to be part of a new movement for American nationalism and take our country back.
[00:36:38.433 --> 00:36:39.113]  Absolutely.
[00:36:39.173 --> 00:36:40.913]  That's why we have a lot of friends.
[00:36:40.973 --> 00:36:42.213]  That's why I'm still alive.
[00:36:42.273 --> 00:36:45.354]  The globalists are not invincible.
[00:36:46.674 --> 00:36:49.915]  They have been unified, but now at the moment of truth there is some rebellion.
[00:36:50.615 --> 00:36:54.157]  And so there is a silver lining here, and I want to break it down this way.
[00:36:54.818 --> 00:36:56.839]  Andrew Jackson was in his own time.
[00:36:56.939 --> 00:37:04.644]  Andrew Jackson did some horrible things in today's perspective, but in his time, from his view, he really thought he was serving the people.
[00:37:04.704 --> 00:37:06.505]  He really wouldn't take money from his office.
[00:37:07.646 --> 00:37:09.007]  It was manifest destiny.
[00:37:09.547 --> 00:37:17.112]  It was survival of the fittest, but he really was believing it was for the greater good of the general public, at least in a subset, racially.
[00:37:17.492 --> 00:37:21.015]  I'm not defending that, but you have to respect that he really believed what he was doing.
[00:37:21.455 --> 00:37:26.059]  This predator class revels in going after the smart and intelligent.
[00:37:26.279 --> 00:37:27.520]  They want to dumb down the mess.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:38.649]  They want to carry out dumbing down, disenfranchisement of everyone, and so they sold a lot of hawks in our government that, yeah, we're staging attacks, and yeah, we're attacking countries, but it's for America.
[00:37:39.469 --> 00:37:44.653]  And now those deluded hawks that believe that are now going, wait a minute, this isn't even for America or for my grandkids.
[00:37:45.033 --> 00:37:49.497]  Because, you know, the argument of, well, if we're not evil, somebody else will do these tricks and they'll be in control.
[00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:51.719]  We've got to guard goodness with pure evil.
[00:37:51.959 --> 00:37:54.100]  You know, kind of like guard the truth, the bodyguard of lies.
[00:37:54.621 --> 00:37:56.182]  You know, so there's that rationalization.
[00:37:56.202 --> 00:38:02.387]  I think they're now figuring out, my God, this is, this is totally nihilistic and this isn't even what I signed up for.
[00:38:02.867 --> 00:38:07.251]  These people are really going to, you know, this isn't, I mean, do you see the point I'm making?
[00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:09.032]  Yes, I think that's happening.
[00:38:10.327 --> 00:38:10.847]  Yes, I do.
[00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:15.310]  Also, Andrew Jackson, I think, was on the right side in the banking issue.
[00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.673]  He was the one who got rid of the power of the Second Bank of the United States.
[00:38:19.993 --> 00:38:23.215]  Exactly, and he was fighting with Native Americans when it would be 5-1, 10-1, 15-1 against the U.S.
[00:38:23.235 --> 00:38:24.436]  forces when it was real wars.
[00:38:29.939 --> 00:38:45.312]  uh... and when they were being overrun and beaten so it was it was a thing of and you know hiring one native group to attack the other but now it can be seen as oh my god he was engaging in genocide when it was really life-and-death struggle between you know uh... Ice Age man and uh... you know Ice Age
[00:38:45.772 --> 00:38:58.955]  Asians that had come over into North America, and then into Mesoamerica, and I'm not... I mean, we can certainly in hindsight look at what happened, but you know, the Hollywood image is the 1880s, the final extermination, the final tracking down, and I think that's wrong.
[00:38:59.155 --> 00:39:07.376]  But we can see where the eugenics idea then comes out of that, and now it's just being used as a tool of statecraft and mind control, but I digress.
[00:39:08.097 --> 00:39:10.117]  Let's take some calls here.
[00:39:11.017 --> 00:39:14.458]  Let's go ahead and talk to... First up, Lansing, Montana?
[00:39:16.128 --> 00:39:17.069]  Lance, you're on the air.
[00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.750]  Go ahead.
[00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.153]  Yeah, I just have one quick question for Mr. Cook.
[00:39:22.033 --> 00:39:26.077]  What would you suggest to people that have 401ks and retirement accounts?
[00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:29.039]  Would you suggest that they pull them out or let them ride?
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:36.706]  Well, let me say, first of all, I'm not a licensed financial counselor, so I can't give individual advice enough.
[00:39:37.173 --> 00:39:39.995]  A lot of people write to me about that.
[00:39:41.055 --> 00:39:45.758]  I think you should just do your own analysis, and you should base it on a worst-case scenario.
[00:39:46.238 --> 00:39:56.463]  Now, of course, they're floating the stock market, and the reason they're floating the stock market is because the financiers have so much money in it, and so much of the money in the stock market rides on investments in China.
[00:39:57.244 --> 00:40:01.666]  That's a huge part of what is keeping the stock market over the $12,000 level.
[00:40:02.247 --> 00:40:05.848]  It's because the American people can't buy that stuff and can't pay for it.
[00:40:07.398 --> 00:40:13.583]  So as far as what your investments are concerned, all I can say is get a good counselor, take a worst-case scenario, and go from there.
[00:40:14.364 --> 00:40:15.345]  Okay, thank you much.
[00:40:15.905 --> 00:40:16.506]  Absolutely.
[00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:20.949]  Get out of debt, have storable food, try to have a place to boogie out to.
[00:40:20.969 --> 00:40:31.638]  I mean, even five acres, a hundred miles outside your town, away from anybody, if you've got to, you know, with an RV and supplies, you know, in case there's riots and total breakdown.
[00:40:31.658 --> 00:40:33.300]  And I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:47.788]  But if there's a meltdown, it is a very good chance that's going to happen, where they, by design, let things break down for months, sometimes even longer, so people beg to be reorganized.
[00:40:47.828 --> 00:40:48.949]  Can you comment on that, Mr. Cook?
[00:40:49.249 --> 00:40:59.916]  Well, I'm going to, in my article that's coming out the next day or two, make a series of suggestions to people once we run through all of the macro solutions about what people should do individually.
[00:41:00.536 --> 00:41:03.418]  First thing I put in there is plant a robust home garden.
[00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:06.860]  Take care of your food supply.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.560]  God help us.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.120]  Start community food co-ops.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.821]  Establish local currencies and barter networks.
[00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:13.802]  Get out of debt.
[00:41:14.422 --> 00:41:15.882]  Become politically active.
[00:41:15.962 --> 00:41:21.104]  Do things that you can do right now to take care of your own needs and those of your family.
[00:41:21.604 --> 00:41:23.525]  Don't worry about the big macro-economy.
[00:41:23.585 --> 00:41:24.705]  I mean, work for change.
[00:41:24.745 --> 00:41:30.027]  Try to get politicians in there who will listen to you, but people have also got to take care of their food supply.
[00:41:31.073 --> 00:41:38.036]  And, you know, if the police are ordered to go door-to-door and take guns, as they admittedly are training to do, cops just don't follow the order.
[00:41:38.817 --> 00:41:40.978]  You know, you don't have to even get in a big fight and argue about it.
[00:41:41.018 --> 00:41:42.999]  Just say you strained your ankle.
[00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:43.819]  Just don't show up.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.842]  Because I just can't believe they're training for it.
[00:41:48.862 --> 00:41:50.602]  I just can't believe they're doing this to us.
[00:41:51.523 --> 00:41:52.743]  Who's up next from Georgia?
[00:41:54.104 --> 00:41:54.564]  Fyrus.
[00:41:54.944 --> 00:41:55.945]  Fyrus in Georgia.
[00:41:55.965 --> 00:41:56.485]  You're on the air.
[00:41:56.505 --> 00:41:56.885]  Go ahead.
[00:41:59.667 --> 00:41:59.807]  Hello?
[00:42:00.615 --> 00:42:01.436]  Yes sir, you're on the air.
[00:42:01.456 --> 00:42:09.463]  Okay, well one thing that I've noticed is that with the rising fuel cost, people have a lot less ability to get around, to move around.
[00:42:10.384 --> 00:42:18.571]  And, I mean, that seems to be one of the, maybe, not necessarily the primary goal, because it seems like we're marching really steadily towards martial law.
[00:42:19.192 --> 00:42:22.775]  But the frightening thing is, I mean, does it seem likely that the whole
[00:42:23.376 --> 00:42:24.617]  That's what I've always been saying.
[00:42:24.637 --> 00:42:26.700]  We can't get focused on the puppet personality.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.923]  This is an agenda and all these politicians are on the surface
[00:42:42.536 --> 00:42:44.037]  Is a simulation.
[00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:12.611]  Again, they know how to tantalize us and get us obsessed with looking at these puppets while, yes, it was all about suppressing you when they took everything you had.
[00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:14.352]  How many years have I been saying that?
[00:43:15.112 --> 00:43:24.337]  I think, too, that you've got to realize that the United States has deliberately been made dependent upon gasoline and petroleum.
[00:43:24.855 --> 00:43:32.461]  I mean, if you go back to all of the decisions that have been made since, really, the 1960s, where we were going to rely on the automobile.
[00:43:32.861 --> 00:43:34.443]  We were just going to build highways.
[00:43:34.543 --> 00:43:36.444]  We weren't going to bother with mass transit.
[00:43:37.225 --> 00:43:41.428]  We were going to build all of these big suburbs spread out all over the landscape.
[00:43:41.849 --> 00:43:47.093]  We were going to build shopping malls and big box stores where you can't even walk from one place to another.
[00:43:47.173 --> 00:43:48.634]  All you can do is drive.
[00:43:49.114 --> 00:43:52.177]  They've created the situation where all they had to do
[00:43:52.904 --> 00:43:57.447]  ...was raise the price of gasoline, and this economy would come to a standstill.
[00:43:57.907 --> 00:44:12.857]  Now, you've got to obviously get around today, but you've also got to demand of the people in charge that you create an economy that is not totally susceptible to this kind of a chokehold, this kind of a breakdown.
[00:44:12.937 --> 00:44:14.338]  I want to go back to what you just said.
[00:44:14.638 --> 00:44:17.240]  I want to go back, because I never heard you say that, and that's exactly what I saw on air.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.422]  But you can just objectively look at what they're doing, and of course they bragged about it.
[00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:22.902]  This is all systematic.
[00:44:23.382 --> 00:44:25.864]  They designed everything to be based on the automobile.
[00:44:25.884 --> 00:44:30.347]  They paid billions to make sure there wasn't mass transit, and I'm not even particularly defending that.
[00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:48.541]  The point is, everything in globalism is to make countries and individuals totally independent, I mean totally dependent, in a prison-like panoptagon, and to make the globalists who are international exempt from all their rules at the national level, where countries are nothing but individual prison grids,
[00:44:49.241 --> 00:44:52.605]  And then they are outside the prison grids with diplomatic immunity.
[00:44:53.105 --> 00:45:04.438]  And they've now reported that police in California, 996,000 employees of the government, are all above the law, no DWIs, no arrests, no speeding.
[00:45:04.799 --> 00:45:08.303]  I mean, and that's what the late Aaron Russo said that Nick Rockefeller told him.
[00:45:08.783 --> 00:45:12.705]  He said, look, we're going to have an ID card, and we're going to be above the law, and you're not.
[00:45:13.006 --> 00:45:13.506]  And that's it.
[00:45:13.566 --> 00:45:20.070]  Diplomatic globalists, people bowing down, kissing their butts, and we're all just slaves locked down in our countries.
[00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.631]  Mr. Cook?
[00:45:21.971 --> 00:45:30.596]  Now, I think that, again, I'm looking at it from the point of view of my specialty, and that is that it all goes back to control of money.
[00:45:31.602 --> 00:45:54.896]  And the control of money that they rely on and the ability to produce debt is all based upon what we call the privately controlled fractional reserve banking system, where the banks have the ability to simply make up credit, create money out of thin air, and then lend it to you and put you into debt to pay them back by your labor that's extended over your lifetime.
[00:45:54.956 --> 00:45:57.558]  And again, that's another factor that has to be changed.
[00:45:57.758 --> 00:45:58.659]  Anything else, Cyrus?
[00:45:59.735 --> 00:46:00.416]  Yeah, one more thing.
[00:46:00.537 --> 00:46:08.051]  I mean, I've heard rumors about, you know, how it's possible that this legislation is trying to bring about some sort of, you know, their belief of Armageddon or whatever.
[00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:11.030]  Listen, listen, that's a front.
[00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:21.372]  They act like they're evangelicals, they act like, and they manipulate, you know, the poor right-wing Christians who aren't even really right-wing to think that open borders, gun control is conservative.
[00:46:21.852 --> 00:46:28.134]  I mean, when you get down to it, they're into occultism, they're into New Age, they're mainly in the Republican Guild.
[00:46:28.654 --> 00:46:35.535]  It's like a club, it's like a homosexual guild, and that's kind of a rite of passage into their gang.
[00:46:36.375 --> 00:46:37.676]  Actually, a lot of gangs are like that.
[00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:40.177]  And so it's kind of a front.
[00:46:41.597 --> 00:46:44.619]  And then, yeah, they have Christians saying, praise God, it's Armageddon.
[00:46:44.939 --> 00:46:46.459]  We want to make Jesus come.
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.262]  And so there's a right-wing cult they're controlling, but it's only a subset.
[00:46:51.282 --> 00:46:52.402]  You want to comment on that, Mr. Cook?
[00:46:53.222 --> 00:46:59.425]  Well, I think that there's a lot of this secrecy and a lot of this
[00:47:03.244 --> 00:47:06.565]  Clubbism, if you will, that certainly is going on.
[00:47:06.725 --> 00:47:16.249]  But again, from my point of view, we've got to realize that it rests upon their ability to control money and their ability to create money out of the banking system.
[00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:21.150]  You take that away, how many of these people could go to work and earn an honest living?
[00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:27.532]  Well, not very many of them could, because they're living as parasites off of the producing system.
[00:47:28.052 --> 00:47:32.334]  We have to take back the whole system of credit creation
[00:47:33.135 --> 00:47:46.839]  Well, I want to be clear, though, about this in our republic, is that it's killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, but they're so greedy they don't even want that goose to have a life.
[00:47:47.199 --> 00:47:53.961]  They'd rather have a dead goose and have the only golden eggs that were laid than have golden eggs laid that somebody else might get their hands on.
[00:47:54.881 --> 00:48:01.548]  It's a total religion of control freak behavior where they don't care if we all live in slums and are being euthanized.
[00:48:01.568 --> 00:48:02.909]  They don't care if we're starving to death.
[00:48:03.209 --> 00:48:14.180]  As long as they're in armored citadels with guys in black uniforms following their orders, it's about having total control because psychopaths gravitate towards law enforcement, politics, and power.
[00:48:14.961 --> 00:48:18.303]  Normal people get a modicum of power and then aren't hungry anymore.
[00:48:18.664 --> 00:48:21.846]  It's only the mentally ill that crave control and domination.
[00:48:22.226 --> 00:48:32.333]  That's why Stalin, Hitler, and others, when they had unlimited power, went crazy and started killing everybody because it's part of the pathological extremism.
[00:48:32.373 --> 00:48:33.914]  Mr. Cook, you want to comment on that statement?
[00:48:34.614 --> 00:48:35.955]  Well, I think that's so.
[00:48:36.195 --> 00:48:43.820]  But again, it's my own view that we have to understand what to put into place to replace all of that.
[00:48:45.259 --> 00:48:49.103]  You can't fight something unless you have knowledge of what it should be like.
[00:48:49.183 --> 00:49:03.497]  And so, again, going back to the Fractional Reserve Banking System, in the monetary reform movement, we believe that the government should be the ones who are lending to the banks, and that we should be, as a people,
[00:49:04.253 --> 00:49:04.513]  I think?
[00:49:34.874 --> 00:49:43.720]  Yeah, and let me just put a figure out there, which is one that I'm going to put out on Global Research when this article comes out in the next day or two.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:50:02.573]  My own estimate is that if we could implement these kind of reforms, we could eliminate three-fourths or more of the current tax burden that our economy is subject to, and that we could, by taking control of currency issuance, by taking control of
[00:50:03.274 --> 00:50:06.057]  Uh, the ability to create a national dividend.
[00:50:06.517 --> 00:50:11.762]  We can get rid of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution and the direct income tax altogether.
[00:50:11.782 --> 00:50:22.692]  Uh, there's one other thing that I want to mention that we can do right now that would take away a lot of the power of the financial manipulators
[00:50:23.226 --> 00:50:28.710]  And that would be to outlaw all leveraged banking based upon speculation.
[00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.072]  Absolutely, and there's all sorts of ways they do that.
[00:50:32.092 --> 00:50:34.734]  We'll have you back soon to break down some of those specifics.
[00:50:34.754 --> 00:50:36.815]  I agree with that recommendation as well.
[00:50:36.895 --> 00:50:41.498]  For internet listeners of the InfoWars.com streams, you need to go there right now.
[00:50:41.858 --> 00:50:43.299]  We're going to do this three-minute break.
[00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:45.621]  We're going to do an interview right now because this is so important.
[00:50:46.061 --> 00:50:51.825]  Then we're going to come back and talk to Dan in Texas, and Phoenix in Atlanta, and maybe a few more.
[00:50:51.845 --> 00:50:54.087]  Alright, interview continues at infowars.com.
[00:50:57.313 --> 00:51:20.783]  Okay, yeah, this is so important, and next time we have you back on for the full audience, we'll talk about that, but explain what leverage banking, how they, not just fractional reserve to the power of 10, but setting up sub-banks who then loan it out times 10 or times 20, depending on how the country sets it, or AAA rating, debt, and then selling it in bundles, derivatives, I mean, break down different forms of leverage banking.
[00:51:20.843 --> 00:51:21.703]  Explain that to people.
[00:51:22.543 --> 00:51:44.842]  Well, what it means is that when these financiers purchase things, and that can be stocks, it can be whole companies when they are operating an equity fund, it can be futures when they're in there buying commodity futures and running up the cost of food, they're not putting their own money down for those kind of purchases.
[00:51:45.342 --> 00:51:47.924]  They're putting down a very tiny proportion of it.
[00:51:47.964 --> 00:51:50.987]  Now, probably most people are familiar with buying stocks on margin.
[00:51:51.676 --> 00:51:52.177]  We're good to go!
[00:52:11.347 --> 00:52:40.320]  And that creates huge volatility and moves the market completely away over time as it now has from real business in real commodities and in real development and makes it top-heavy where the vast majority of everything is just wild speculation and in that vortex projectors, con artists, paper scams flourish and then endanger all the real investments the general public has invested in
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.201]  For their retirements, for their schools, for the society.
[00:52:43.421 --> 00:52:44.741]  Well, that is correct.
[00:52:44.921 --> 00:52:53.983]  And one thing it does even more than that, that I think is just astounding, is say you're purchased as Dunkin' Donuts was by the Carlisle Fund.
[00:52:55.003 --> 00:53:08.506]  Not only do you now at Dunkin' Donuts have to work to meet the expenses of that business, but because the Carlisle Fund borrowed money from a bank to make that purchase, you now are also paying off that loan to the bank.
[00:53:09.051 --> 00:53:10.712]  And so your pay is going to be cut.
[00:53:11.313 --> 00:53:12.753]  Your payroll is going to be cut.
[00:53:12.854 --> 00:53:14.214]  Employees are going to be let go.
[00:53:14.655 --> 00:53:17.276]  Costs are going to be cut in every possible way.
[00:53:17.296 --> 00:53:19.418]  And that's why service... Just to pay that loan.
[00:53:19.478 --> 00:53:21.159]  That's why service is falling apart.
[00:53:21.239 --> 00:53:22.520]  Everything's degenerating.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:38.090]  You go in huge stores and there's no employees because some greedy, stupid bastard who's leveraged everything is at Lake Tahoe with his mistresses and it doesn't matter if the company's going to go bankrupt a year later, he's making $100 million right now.
[00:53:38.945 --> 00:53:50.329]  There are estimates that up to 40 percent, that's 4-0, 40 percent of the price that you pay for any article that you purchase to pay off a bank loan.
[00:53:50.609 --> 00:53:53.090]  Yeah, it's a banker tax, one of many.
[00:53:53.250 --> 00:53:54.371]  We're going back live right now.
[00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:54.711]  Here we go.
[00:54:02.284 --> 00:54:03.525]  The criminals are scared.
[00:54:03.545 --> 00:54:07.690]  They know they've raped you hard and the real raping is about to begin.
[00:54:08.231 --> 00:54:09.553]  They don't want you to fight back.
[00:54:09.993 --> 00:54:12.516]  Homeland Security is going to tie you down so they can do it.
[00:54:13.177 --> 00:54:14.439]  Are you going to go along with it?
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:17.963]  And are our police in history going to be known as Nazis?
[00:54:18.644 --> 00:54:19.305]  As Soviets?
[00:54:19.405 --> 00:54:19.845]  As scum?
[00:54:20.726 --> 00:54:23.448]  Or will you join us and not go along with this criminality?
[00:54:24.209 --> 00:54:25.630]  RichardCCook.com.
[00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.391]  Works in the Carter White House.
[00:54:28.612 --> 00:54:29.652]  Analyst for NASA.
[00:54:29.672 --> 00:54:30.933]  Department of the Treasury.
[00:54:30.953 --> 00:54:31.714]  Very intelligent.
[00:54:31.974 --> 00:54:34.436]  Look forward to having him back up for another two hours in the near future.
[00:54:34.936 --> 00:54:36.437]  Take two final calls right now.
[00:54:36.837 --> 00:54:37.538]  Dan in Texas.
[00:54:37.558 --> 00:54:38.779]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:54:41.381 --> 00:54:42.201]  Go ahead.
[00:54:42.281 --> 00:54:43.082]  You're on the air, Dan.
[00:54:43.638 --> 00:54:45.158]  All right, yeah, I was calling in.
[00:54:45.218 --> 00:54:47.359]  Basically, I'm a fan of Mr. Cook.
[00:54:47.399 --> 00:54:49.620]  I saw the Challenger Revealed book up here.
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.640]  It looks like a great read.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:55:06.784]  My question for Mr. Cook is, basically, what do you think, as far as the economy, we do about slimeballs, degenerates, who would love to make a penny off of the tragedy of September 11th, and lies of loose change like Alex Jones and Jason Burmese?
[00:55:07.852 --> 00:55:11.153]  Hey, listen, I appreciate you calling, sir.
[00:55:11.493 --> 00:55:14.673]  You can call me back when I'm just taking calls and we can do that.
[00:55:14.733 --> 00:55:16.954]  What do you do about slime balls that make money?
[00:55:17.454 --> 00:55:25.995]  Obviously, I need to make money to be able to defend ourselves, sue people that slander us, pay my employees, and yeah, so I can live comfortably and take care of my family.
[00:55:26.455 --> 00:55:34.617]  I make films, I go out and shoot interviews like anybody else who has a political view, and then I make them free and advertise they're free on the web
[00:55:35.157 --> 00:55:39.879]  And then I'm bad when I am at higher standards than anyone else.
[00:55:40.339 --> 00:55:41.659]  So people can go to your website?
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.560]  Please go to InfoWars.com.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.541]  In fact, listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:47.602]  I'm going to say this to you, Dan.
[00:55:48.782 --> 00:55:50.863]  In fact, I didn't plug the videos today.
[00:55:50.923 --> 00:55:51.503]  I should have.
[00:55:51.863 --> 00:55:53.104]  I'm going to take time out right now.
[00:55:53.124 --> 00:55:54.524]  I didn't want to cut into Mr. Cook's time.
[00:55:54.924 --> 00:55:56.325]  Actually, we need more capital.
[00:55:57.125 --> 00:56:01.868]  People would think we just need to work from a ditch with a tin can and a string here.
[00:56:02.008 --> 00:56:03.469]  I don't plug my videos enough.
[00:56:03.809 --> 00:56:05.550]  Buy all the books and videos we have.
[00:56:05.631 --> 00:56:07.091]  Give us donations if you'd like.
[00:56:07.432 --> 00:56:07.932]  Support us.
[00:56:07.972 --> 00:56:13.075]  I want to get a bigger office, hire more people, do more stories, support more activist groups.
[00:56:13.776 --> 00:56:15.197]  The asinine statement.
[00:56:16.198 --> 00:56:20.922]  I mean, I bring on all these other activist groups and tell you to support them when I'm not getting any gain from it.
[00:56:21.182 --> 00:56:22.423]  This is about survival.
[00:56:22.563 --> 00:56:23.464]  Let me give you a tip, sir.
[00:56:23.765 --> 00:56:26.747]  I didn't do nine hours of radio yesterday because I want dirty money.
[00:56:27.648 --> 00:56:30.451]  I'm trying to tell my wife we're not evacuating the country.
[00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:32.072]  I'm trying to face my
[00:56:32.853 --> 00:56:34.134]  Possible imprisonment or death.
[00:56:34.535 --> 00:56:36.256]  I'm living in the real world.
[00:56:36.877 --> 00:56:40.040]  And then you say, what do you do about scumbags that profit from 9-11?
[00:56:40.841 --> 00:56:43.083]  How dare you imply we were involved in the attacks?
[00:56:43.123 --> 00:56:44.124]  How dare you imply?
[00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:49.148]  We're here risking our lives, our names, being death-threatened to make films we put out for free.
[00:56:49.168 --> 00:56:49.549]  But yes,
[00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:52.532]  Loose Change Final Cut has still not made its money back.
[00:56:52.812 --> 00:56:54.714]  The people that made it are almost homeless.
[00:56:55.095 --> 00:56:59.119]  Please buy Loose Change Final Cut from us immediately to support us.
[00:56:59.159 --> 00:57:01.181]  Mr. Cook, I'm sorry to run over your time.
[00:57:01.222 --> 00:57:05.446]  In fact, we'll go ten minutes into overdrive now to be able to answer people's questions.
[00:57:05.486 --> 00:57:07.649]  But, you know, the mainstream media says that all the time.
[00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:10.251]  Ooh, you sell videos saying the government's bad.
[00:57:10.272 --> 00:57:11.333]  You're not allowed
[00:57:11.693 --> 00:57:14.775]  to make a living and survive having your political view.
[00:57:14.855 --> 00:57:15.915]  Everybody else can.
[00:57:16.116 --> 00:57:17.296]  Bill O'Reilly can.
[00:57:17.676 --> 00:57:19.077]  All these news anchors can.
[00:57:19.277 --> 00:57:20.538]  The Carlisle Group can.
[00:57:20.958 --> 00:57:25.981]  I'm not out with a government with taxes forcing people to give money to me, Mr. Cook.
[00:57:26.221 --> 00:57:27.742]  I mean, how do they say I'm bad?
[00:57:27.962 --> 00:57:29.163]  That's our enemy's argument.
[00:57:30.043 --> 00:57:36.487]  Well, you know, a lot of these people are being paid by loans that the government has to sell to China.
[00:57:37.065 --> 00:57:46.074]  Because we can't afford to pay our own way in this country, so... Oh, and they admit they have thousands of fake sitcom people calling in and blogging, but I don't think that's one of these people.
[00:57:46.314 --> 00:57:47.115]  They're jealous.
[00:57:47.155 --> 00:57:52.380]  A lot of people in our movement are jealous of anyone that actually hires an employee, starts an operation.
[00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:53.822]  Stay there, Mr. Cook.
[00:57:53.862 --> 00:57:56.885]  I want to, if you can, do ten more minutes in super overdrive.
[00:57:57.185 --> 00:57:58.826]  We're going to leave the Genesis Network now.
[00:57:59.086 --> 00:58:08.410]  We're going to do 10 minutes in super overdrive on the internet streams where tens of thousands of you are listening right now and PrisonPlanet.tv for viewers.
[00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:15.053]  If you want to hear that, you've got to get off the Genesis Stream and others and go over to InfoWars.com or if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:58:15.073 --> 00:58:17.334]  But don't let those enemies stop us.
[00:58:17.394 --> 00:58:18.955]  I should have plugged my videos earlier.
[00:58:19.335 --> 00:58:20.475]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:20.555 --> 00:58:21.696]  Buy them on DVD.
[00:58:21.976 --> 00:58:23.817]  Defeat that enemy, Dan.
[00:58:24.498 --> 00:58:27.171]  We'll be right back with Phoenix and others.
[00:58:27.191 --> 00:58:27.653]  Stay with us.
[00:58:32.691 --> 00:58:36.615]  Okay, we're going to call the guests back right now.
[00:58:36.655 --> 00:58:36.775]  John?
[00:58:36.795 --> 00:58:38.336]  Thank you for listening to GC.
[00:58:38.356 --> 00:58:38.636]  John?
[00:58:38.877 --> 00:58:40.078]  Okay, I will disconnect you.
[00:58:40.118 --> 00:58:49.126]  Will you, I am, you know my board op down here is, I am correct, just get Mr. Cook's number, tell him we're calling him in two minutes.
[00:58:49.406 --> 00:58:50.107]  Okay, I'll do that.
[00:58:50.227 --> 00:58:50.928]  Thanks a lot, my friend.
[00:58:51.048 --> 00:58:51.448]  No problem.
[00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.149]  See you tomorrow.
[00:58:52.169 --> 00:58:54.411]  Okay, everybody get in the behind the scenes here.
[00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:55.031]  We will do that now.
[00:58:58.274 --> 00:59:00.676]  Yeah, you know, I wish I had more time with that caller.
[00:59:00.696 --> 00:59:05.761]  We're going to take a few more calls from Mr. Cook, but it is such an asinine argument.
[00:59:06.201 --> 00:59:08.984]  You know, let's not deal with were there bombs in Building 7.
[00:59:09.624 --> 00:59:15.630]  Let's not deal with how they're building FEMA camps and it's in the major paper and congressmen are coming out and saying 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:18.332]  Let's talk about how it's bad
[00:59:20.034 --> 00:59:31.861]  Let's talk about how it's a bad thing for me to be able to buy a $800 microphone so the audio is good to you.
[00:59:32.262 --> 00:59:38.866]  How do you think the government takes our money and uses it to attack us and wage war on us?
[00:59:40.767 --> 00:59:43.108]  Wage war on us!
[00:59:45.149 --> 00:59:47.231]  And then I'm here making films
[00:59:49.847 --> 00:59:51.948]  That actually, in many cases, lose money.
[00:59:52.049 --> 00:59:54.710]  I use advertising money that comes from the radio to pay for them.
[00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:57.332]  I put them on the Google Video for free.
[00:59:58.193 --> 01:00:02.375]  We have a prisonplanet.tv if you want to pay 15 cents, we can pay with a bandwidth to get it to you in high quality.
[01:00:02.636 --> 01:00:04.357]  We tell you to make copies of the DVDs.
[01:00:05.818 --> 01:00:06.778]  And then we're bad!
[01:00:07.879 --> 01:00:14.103]  But the government can put out its 9-11 commission report, purilize and sell it for 15 bucks.
[01:00:15.624 --> 01:00:19.227]  I mean, it's intellectually bankrupt and
[01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:25.615]  Actually, I should focus more on monetary things.
[01:00:25.675 --> 01:00:28.398]  I'm having to look at a bigger office right now and thinking, do we have the money?
[01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:30.301]  We're going into a recession, depression.
[01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:34.767]  I need to hire more people, more video, more web, reaching more people.
[01:00:34.807 --> 01:00:36.769]  We're on the cutting edge of fighting the New World Order.
[01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:40.552]  And I think, oh God, I don't want to have to sit here and plug a bunch of sponsors and money grub.
[01:00:40.792 --> 01:00:41.233]  But you know what?
[01:00:41.313 --> 01:00:41.633]  I am.
[01:00:41.673 --> 01:00:43.735]  Because you don't like it, CENTCOM, I am.
[01:00:43.775 --> 01:00:47.998]  In fact, I want listeners right now to go to InfoWars.com and buy all the books and videos.
[01:00:48.418 --> 01:00:48.798]  You know why?
[01:00:48.818 --> 01:00:53.962]  Because I want to hire more people and do a better job and get better cameras and I want to give these employees out here bonuses.
[01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:57.532]  I want to take care of them and their families, because I enjoy that.
[01:00:58.152 --> 01:01:00.673]  So you fail, you lose again, New World Order.
[01:01:01.013 --> 01:01:03.755]  Let's go back to Mr. Cook and take a few final calls.
[01:01:04.135 --> 01:01:05.456]  RichardCCook.com.
[01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:06.897]  Richard C. Cook is our guest.
[01:01:07.717 --> 01:01:09.838]  Let's go to Phoenix in Atlanta.
[01:01:10.158 --> 01:01:11.199]  You're on the air, Phoenix.
[01:01:12.339 --> 01:01:12.760]  Oh, hello?
[01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:13.600]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:01:14.941 --> 01:01:17.542]  Well, the first thing I want to say is, wow, to that dude.
[01:01:18.063 --> 01:01:18.963]  I mean, oh my God.
[01:01:19.023 --> 01:01:19.783]  I mean, wow.
[01:01:20.464 --> 01:01:22.325]  I just want to say that, you know,
[01:01:23.925 --> 01:01:28.808]  I'm not familiar with you, Mr. Cook.
[01:01:29.249 --> 01:01:30.649]  I've listened to your show, Alex.
[01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:36.593]  The only thing you can tell a person like him is that I love you, dude.
[01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.675]  Despite what you feel, despite what you believe,
[01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:41.811]  I love you, dude.
[01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:45.573]  It's okay if you got negative energy or whatever.
[01:01:45.693 --> 01:01:47.274]  Everything's coming down around us.
[01:01:47.294 --> 01:01:48.855]  We're facing total depression.
[01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:52.838]  They're building FEMA camps, and this guy says you shouldn't make films.
[01:01:53.198 --> 01:01:57.441]  I have a First Amendment right to make films and put them out, okay?
[01:01:57.541 --> 01:01:59.342]  And I'm trying to save this country.
[01:01:59.762 --> 01:02:02.024]  You know, Alex, and the thing is, you know,
[01:02:03.064 --> 01:02:03.905]  Don't fret about him.
[01:02:04.205 --> 01:02:05.226]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:02:05.386 --> 01:02:09.349]  If you are doing what's in your heart, then don't fret about him.
[01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.031]  We create our reality.
[01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:12.332]  No, I know that.
[01:02:12.352 --> 01:02:13.953]  Do you have any questions for Richard C. Cook?
[01:02:13.973 --> 01:02:15.014]  I don't mean to get us to write it off.
[01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:21.780]  No, I just wanted to know, the reason I called was because you said that Aaron Russo is dead.
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:22.540]  Is that true?
[01:02:23.321 --> 01:02:25.663]  Yes, Aaron Russo died last August.
[01:02:30.112 --> 01:02:30.832]  How did he pass?
[01:02:30.852 --> 01:02:32.173]  Because I didn't even hear about it.
[01:02:32.253 --> 01:02:36.334]  Yeah, he had cancer and he died, what, the last three or four months, I believe.
[01:02:36.354 --> 01:02:39.514]  He died August 24th, August 26th.
[01:02:39.554 --> 01:02:41.155]  Okay, so it's been almost a year.
[01:02:41.695 --> 01:02:42.155]  Oh, wow!
[01:02:42.315 --> 01:02:54.378]  But let me just mention also, if I could, a lot of the things that I've talked about today are going to be in much more detail in the new Global Research article that'll be out in the next couple days.
[01:02:55.419 --> 01:03:03.426]  Please be sure to take a look at that, and you'll see more about the National Dividend, more about the Infrastructure Bank, and other proposals that we are making.
[01:03:03.726 --> 01:03:04.307]  Absolutely!
[01:03:04.327 --> 01:03:05.328]  Anything else, Phoenix?
[01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:09.411]  Okay, and one more thing, and this is just going for the future.
[01:03:09.711 --> 01:03:22.843]  I am a buddy filmmaker, so I might want to, I wanted to be able to get in contact with you later, because it's in the beginning stages right now, but I want to get back in contact with you later, because I want to use you
[01:03:23.423 --> 01:03:26.789]  A little bit in the film and then that way you can make some money too.
[01:03:37.082 --> 01:03:46.564]  The guest we had in studio yesterday, G. Edward Griffin, said, he said, libertarians, patriots, freedom lovers always said, we need to get rid of the power in government.
[01:03:46.844 --> 01:03:49.404]  We need to tear down government and we don't need power ourselves.
[01:03:49.865 --> 01:03:57.666]  Well, the founders actually said, limited government to guard against bigger government and corrupt interests using the mechanisms of government for themselves.
[01:03:57.706 --> 01:04:01.767]  We need an understanding, a renaissance of the structures of government and we need money.
[01:04:02.307 --> 01:04:03.048]  We need power.
[01:04:03.088 --> 01:04:04.769]  The globalists control the issuance.
[01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:08.572]  The private Federal Reserve owns the issuance of our currency.
[01:04:08.652 --> 01:04:18.340]  They own the money machines, and then they tell us on the news, it's their favorite thing, anybody criticizing the government, they just make money off of criticizing America.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.023]  No, we're trying to save the country, and we need money.
[01:04:23.244 --> 01:04:30.910]  And then when I get those calls, I get mad because I'm like, my God, I've just done hours and hours of a show and haven't plugged my videos, which aren't just how we fund ourselves.
[01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:32.610]  They're powerful.
[01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:33.491]  They're effective.
[01:04:33.751 --> 01:04:35.351]  Mr. Cook needs to be supported.
[01:04:35.591 --> 01:04:39.052]  You know, if we had the capital, we could be more effective.
[01:04:39.112 --> 01:04:43.134]  We need to support alternative media and global research, and we are changed.
[01:04:44.154 --> 01:04:45.074]  And all these groups.
[01:04:45.554 --> 01:04:47.675]  Mr. Cook, you've got five minutes in closing.
[01:04:47.755 --> 01:04:48.615]  You've got the floor.
[01:04:48.655 --> 01:04:51.276]  Whatever other key issues you'd like to talk about.
[01:04:51.316 --> 01:04:55.297]  And again, fleshing out any more on what you think the real... For this first.
[01:04:55.877 --> 01:05:00.399]  The real timetable on the complete meltdown, and if you think there's any way to avert this.
[01:05:01.038 --> 01:05:10.081]  Well, the way to avert it is to gain back the control of the government through a President of the United States who can make a difference.
[01:05:10.961 --> 01:05:14.622]  And however that is done, I'm an analyst.
[01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:25.565]  I'll be glad to work with whoever wants to find a way out of this thing, because I do have, along with the other monetary reformers,
[01:05:26.277 --> 01:05:50.187]  Who are working on this real solutions and so it's up to you really it's up to the people of this country to take back the power of their vote of their responsibility and then the people who can fix this thing can step in and make a difference and that's what I'm trying to make available to people is the mental framework
[01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:57.131]  The tools, the systems that can take back our country for the people who live here, for we the people.
[01:05:57.851 --> 01:06:05.238]  And that is something that we all have to take responsibility for, and we have to do it right now, because there's no more time, really.
[01:06:05.598 --> 01:06:15.127]  The time has come when we go one way or the other, and the way I think we should go is back to a United States that we care about, that we love,
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:30.984]  And where the government works for us and the government becomes something that we, the people, can work through to make ourselves fully responsible and fully productive and fully caring about each other and about our country.
[01:06:31.544 --> 01:06:34.905]  So I think these things are really critical to do right now.
[01:06:35.606 --> 01:06:40.747]  And one of the things that we have to do, and this is really, I mentioned a couple of the items in the
[01:06:41.423 --> 01:06:41.863]  We're good.
[01:06:58.889 --> 01:07:01.190]  A written-off where it can be written off.
[01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:02.291]  Because it is fraudulent.
[01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:06.013]  Well, expanding on that, a question I want to throw out at you.
[01:07:06.433 --> 01:07:11.876]  A, what do you think really happened on 9-11 and B, I would imagine you know it's an inside job, what did they plan to gain from that?
[01:07:11.896 --> 01:07:18.379]  And we know launch wars, domestic police state, but I noticed that that attack came right during an economic implosion.
[01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:20.980]  Was that a way to try to reorganize and stave that off?
[01:07:21.841 --> 01:07:22.121]  Well, 9-11
[01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:29.555]  And this is the way that I characterize it, and it'll be mentioned in my article tomorrow.
[01:07:29.575 --> 01:07:39.759]  9-11 was the pretext for pulling plans off the shelf to accomplish the military conquest of the Middle East.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:50.264]  And I believe, and I also say this in the article, that the project for a new American century, which was really the ideological framework that 9-11
[01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:54.415]  Came out of and the invasion of the Middle East came out of.
[01:07:54.555 --> 01:07:56.456]  I characterize that as a Trojan horse.
[01:07:57.276 --> 01:08:08.361]  Because I think the United States was tricked into sending our treasure, our young people, into the Middle East because they knew that this was going to bankrupt our country.
[01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:15.272]  And this was going to be the last thing we did for the financiers before we were dumped in the trash.
[01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:17.493]  And that's a triple blood-sucking.
[01:08:17.713 --> 01:08:30.438]  Everything they do is about squeezing the last of the sanguination, the sucking of the juices, because they shipped our industry overseas, they gave us a sprawling infrastructure based on oil,
[01:08:31.598 --> 01:08:41.004]  They're now countering with a global tax on the oil that they've engineered in the name of saving the earth and the deadly carbon dioxide, almost as deadly as water, the hydrogen dioxide.
[01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:44.827]  So we have all of this going on.
[01:08:46.767 --> 01:08:47.648]  Our country was betrayed.
[01:09:09.148 --> 01:09:13.370]  And the Trojan horse for this was the project for a new American century.
[01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:14.631]  That's my opinion.
[01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:15.612]  That's what I believe.
[01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:16.072]  Exactly.
[01:09:16.092 --> 01:09:19.814]  And it says, oh, we're going to go fight 66 nations and a great American hegemon.
[01:09:20.034 --> 01:09:20.814]  That's the front.
[01:09:20.914 --> 01:09:22.055]  European banks own us.
[01:09:22.295 --> 01:09:25.537]  They're using us to get the Lebensstrahl to grab the real estate.
[01:09:25.617 --> 01:09:26.738]  They, oh, it's terrible.
[01:09:26.758 --> 01:09:27.758]  Look what the Americans are doing.
[01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:28.759]  We fall apart.
[01:09:29.019 --> 01:09:30.840]  They, we go into their receivership.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.281]  They set up their new world order.
[01:09:32.461 --> 01:09:33.721]  I believe that's the scenario.
[01:09:34.442 --> 01:09:35.162]  Well, they've stated it.
[01:09:35.202 --> 01:09:36.043]  Trilateral Commission, 1974.
[01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:38.104]  I believe that's the scenario.
[01:09:39.178 --> 01:09:40.659]  Well, I just commend you, sir.
[01:09:40.679 --> 01:09:42.499]  RichardCeachCook.com.
[01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:44.840]  Are any of your books or publications still in print?
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:45.560]  Yes.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.242]  Challenger Revealed, my history of the Challenger disaster, is in print, is available.
[01:09:51.202 --> 01:09:55.724]  You can get that through my website or online or in bookstores.
[01:09:56.004 --> 01:09:59.705]  I just signed a copy down here at the local Barnes & Noble today.
[01:09:59.765 --> 01:10:00.805]  So that book's available.
[01:10:01.386 --> 01:10:04.647]  I have a new book that we're in process of getting ready for publication.
[01:10:04.707 --> 01:10:05.247]  It's called
[01:10:05.697 --> 01:10:06.257]  We're good to go.
[01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:37.487]  All right, I want to get you back on about more of the solutions and also the Challenger situation and how it was really caused because they, according to what I've read and what you've said, that it was the military projects and how that all fed in together.
[01:10:37.507 --> 01:10:41.649]  And of course, you were an analyst at NASA as well, so uniquely qualified to cover that.
[01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:43.050]  It's a very interesting part of history.
[01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:44.690]  Mr. Cook, thanks for all the time today.
[01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:46.011]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:46.631]  I appreciate it.
[01:10:46.651 --> 01:10:46.991]  Take care.
[01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:48.032]  There goes Mr. Cook.
[01:10:49.841 --> 01:10:54.123]  I will say here at the end that both these films need to be seen.
[01:10:54.143 --> 01:10:57.945]  You don't just support me, you support the filmmakers because we split it 50-50.
[01:10:58.485 --> 01:11:01.807]  American Drug War, it isn't even in stores until the 24th of next month.
[01:11:02.307 --> 01:11:05.369]  I've had it for a month in stock because I'm a consultant and I'm in it.
[01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:08.531]  And it's got three hours of extras, two hour film.
[01:11:09.071 --> 01:11:10.232]  Absolutely must see.
[01:11:10.612 --> 01:11:12.092]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:11:12.433 --> 01:11:13.813]  And Washington, you're fired, 1995.
[01:11:15.214 --> 01:11:17.678]  Really what I'd call the heir to America, freedom to fascism.
[01:11:17.718 --> 01:11:19.560]  It's just really a fabulous movie.
[01:11:19.821 --> 01:11:21.864]  My film's in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:11:22.064 --> 01:11:23.666]  Let's say you've seen it for free on Google.
[01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:24.601]  Good!
[01:11:24.902 --> 01:11:26.263]  But if you can afford it, give us $19.95.
[01:11:26.443 --> 01:11:29.125]  You can get it for $9.95 when you get it with another film.
[01:11:29.665 --> 01:11:31.106]  And make copies of that DVD.
[01:11:31.126 --> 01:11:32.007]  That's a better way.
[01:11:32.107 --> 01:11:32.367]  Get it.
[01:11:32.647 --> 01:11:33.548]  Buy a hundred blanks.
[01:11:33.648 --> 01:11:34.309]  Make copies.
[01:11:34.569 --> 01:11:36.010]  Please, get it on AXS TV.
[01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:37.711]  They're shutting down AXS everywhere.
[01:11:37.851 --> 01:11:38.772]  Use it while you can.
[01:11:39.152 --> 01:11:41.354]  If you had an AXS show in the past, go back and do it again.
[01:11:41.834 --> 01:11:45.697]  All these little things will bring the New World Order to their knees.
[01:11:46.098 --> 01:11:47.379]  So please support us.
[01:11:47.399 --> 01:11:49.120]  You can also call toll free to get my films, 888-253-3139.
[01:11:54.004 --> 01:11:56.205]  I don't say this for the theatrics and the effect.
[01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:57.206]  I mean, I get death threats.
[01:11:57.266 --> 01:11:58.247]  I've been physically attacked.
[01:11:59.408 --> 01:12:01.389]  I've had stuff happen to me you can't even believe.
[01:12:01.409 --> 01:12:05.692]  You know, Dr. Horowitz has had the FBI at his house.
[01:12:05.732 --> 01:12:06.873]  I've had Secret Service here.
[01:12:06.893 --> 01:12:09.035]  I mean, my family's really worried.
[01:12:09.055 --> 01:12:10.416]  This is serious business.
[01:12:10.796 --> 01:12:12.637]  We're not doing this to play games.
[01:12:13.678 --> 01:12:14.339]  You know, we're human.
[01:12:14.359 --> 01:12:14.939]  We joke around.
[01:12:14.979 --> 01:12:15.760]  We screw around.
[01:12:16.701 --> 01:12:17.501]  I'm not perfect.
[01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:19.623]  I wish I did a better job, but this is life and death.
[01:12:21.133 --> 01:12:23.314]  This isn't about being a big shot and having some movies out there.
[01:12:23.714 --> 01:12:29.098]  I've got to be as big as I can be just to make sure my life was worth something and try to save people.
[01:12:29.519 --> 01:12:30.960]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:12:31.941 --> 01:12:32.741]  You've got to do that.
[01:12:32.761 --> 01:12:35.063]  I mean, you see everything we talked about came true?
[01:12:35.403 --> 01:12:36.704]  You see how it's all happening?
[01:12:37.585 --> 01:12:39.266]  They told us in all their own documents.
[01:12:39.306 --> 01:12:41.788]  CFR, Trilateral Commission, World Bank documents.
[01:12:41.828 --> 01:12:43.129]  I mean, we're in trouble, folks.
[01:12:43.329 --> 01:12:44.310]  They're building camps.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.722]  And I just, you know, we're a decadent, slothful, pig-like society.
[01:12:50.943 --> 01:12:52.724]  Not all of us, but the vast majority.
[01:12:53.204 --> 01:13:03.650]  And they're just like, they think America is like an amusement park, and suddenly stuff costs more, and suddenly they can't buy as much beer, but still they're just like, everything will be alright.
[01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:06.351]  It isn't going to be alright until these bad guys get out of here.
[01:13:06.852 --> 01:13:08.172]  They're not going to stop squeezing.
[01:13:09.153 --> 01:13:10.354]  I mean, they want to hurt you.
[01:13:10.394 --> 01:13:11.074]  They're into that.
[01:13:11.234 --> 01:13:12.455]  You understand there's bad men?
[01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:14.251]  You understand?
[01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:15.231]  No, you don't know history.
[01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:20.053]  Well, I know most of you do, but our viewers do, but a lot of you new people watching, giggling on YouTube and stuff.
[01:13:20.893 --> 01:13:37.818]  I remember a year ago writing articles for PrisonPlanet.com, Infoworks.com, people on the Dig comments on the message board going, you piece of trash, liar, lying about the dollar, lying about the war costing too much, lying, trying to bring down our nation, our Federal Reserve cares, George Bush cares, you liberal trash.
[01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:39.490]  People to counter him.
[01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.850]  No, no, no.
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:40.952]  They don't believe in left and right.
[01:13:41.032 --> 01:13:41.813]  No, no, no.
[01:13:42.153 --> 01:13:43.635]  This is a military consolidation.
[01:13:43.675 --> 01:13:45.056]  This is conquest by an elite.
[01:13:45.557 --> 01:13:46.858]  Shut up, Commie!
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:52.545]  The guys at CENTCOM writing that and their minions and fellow travelers, you're going to be hurt by all this.
[01:13:53.646 --> 01:13:55.969]  I remember them bragging, going, yeah, it's about oil in Iraq.
[01:13:55.989 --> 01:13:57.150]  We're going to have lower prices.
[01:13:58.137 --> 01:14:09.320]  They attacked Iraq the first time, told them to go ahead and invade Kuwait because there were new articles in the news in 1990 about Saddam over-pumping, selling too much, driving down the price, 85, 90 cents a gallon.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.060]  OPEC got pissed!
[01:14:12.821 --> 01:14:13.861]  That's why they invaded him.
[01:14:15.821 --> 01:14:16.762]  You think it's about oil?
[01:14:16.802 --> 01:14:17.382]  It is about oil!
[01:14:17.422 --> 01:14:19.102]  It's about cutting the flow off, dummies!
[01:14:19.862 --> 01:14:21.203]  That's your opinion, liberal!
[01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:22.023]  Call me!
[01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:30.478]  Associated Press, 2001, hundreds of pages of documents of the oil companies planning all this with OPEC.
[01:14:30.538 --> 01:14:31.678]  I mean, it's not my opinion.
[01:14:32.198 --> 01:14:33.339]  It's not my opinion.
[01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:37.240]  You're not conservatives at Free Republic and Michelle Malkin and all of you.
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:38.800]  It's not funny, folks!
[01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.481]  The BATF being tripled in size is not cute.
[01:14:42.961 --> 01:14:44.322]  Open borders is not cute.
[01:14:44.602 --> 01:14:46.122]  Saying there's no North American Union.
[01:14:46.322 --> 01:14:50.744]  Rush Limbaugh saying the CFR didn't exist for 15 years and now saying it does but it's good.
[01:14:51.044 --> 01:14:51.884]  That isn't funny!
[01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:56.669]  I told you Rush Limbaugh would endorse Hillary Clinton five years ago.
[01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:00.150]  Not because he wants to screw up the nomination.
[01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.491]  Watch what happens with this election.
[01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:02.411]  Watch how you get taken.
[01:15:04.972 --> 01:15:09.133]  No, he did that because he's published by the CFR, his books.
[01:15:09.814 --> 01:15:14.895]  He did that because Roger Ailes is advising and at the highest levels running the Hillary campaign with Rupert Murdoch.
[01:15:15.616 --> 01:15:16.976]  And then it came out in the news after I said it.
[01:15:17.156 --> 01:15:19.257]  But you're not going to figure that out until it's too late, are you?
[01:15:20.572 --> 01:15:23.974]  You're never going to figure any of it out.
[01:15:24.875 --> 01:15:25.695]  You don't want to.
[01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:26.876]  You want to lose.
[01:15:27.216 --> 01:15:28.677]  You want to lose your family.
[01:15:28.697 --> 01:15:30.418]  You want to lose your bank account.
[01:15:31.139 --> 01:15:34.321]  And you want to just keep kissing the ass of these scumbags.
[01:15:36.328 --> 01:15:36.968]  I'm out of time.
[01:15:37.568 --> 01:15:38.369]  God bless you all.
[01:15:38.449 --> 01:15:41.249]  Retransmission on Infowars.com, the same stream you're listening to.
[01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:45.031]  We are about to go right into the 15 minutes into the first hour.
[01:15:45.571 --> 01:15:47.631]  Amazing show if you missed any of it.
[01:15:48.392 --> 01:15:49.732]  Please get this out to everybody.
[01:15:50.092 --> 01:15:51.032]  I want to beat these people.
[01:15:51.112 --> 01:15:51.653]  I want to win.
[01:15:51.933 --> 01:15:52.793]  God bless you all.
[01:15:53.073 --> 01:15:54.553]  See you back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:15:54.573 --> 01:15:55.194]  to 3 p.m.
[01:15:55.554 --> 01:15:56.494]  Central Standard Time.
[01:15:56.854 --> 01:16:00.235]  I only did four hours and 15 minutes of radio today, not nine hours.
[01:16:00.635 --> 01:16:01.916]  So this is an easy day for me.
[01:16:02.836 --> 01:16:03.116]  Bye-bye.
