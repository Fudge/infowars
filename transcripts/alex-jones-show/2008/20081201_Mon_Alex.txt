[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:15.316]  Yeah, we had a scheduling issue.
[00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:17.457]  This happens.
[00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:20.979]  So Major General Stubblebine will not be on with us today.
[00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.020]  We just went live, by the way, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.081]  So we're rescheduling.
[00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.743]  He and his accomplished wife
[00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:36.964]  Dr. Labo to Wednesday for a full hour with us because so much is happening with Codex Alimentarius.
[00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.208]  But I also wanted to do half the interview about Codex Alimentarius.
[00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:46.176]  They've been to Europe repeatedly to cover the takeover of the vitamins and minerals and nutrients by this international cartel.
[00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:50.739]  Creating this monopoly to make you get a prescription for any basic vitamins.
[00:00:51.159 --> 00:01:01.483]  But I also want to talk about the population reduction agenda and get Major General's take on that because, you know, both of these people together make an incredible interview.
[00:01:01.523 --> 00:01:02.403]  But we're honored right now.
[00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:09.426]  I'm just going to have them on for one segment because we're going to have them both on with us on Wednesday in the fourth hour.
[00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:10.107]  Dr. Rima E.
[00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:22.297]  LeBeau MD, just an amazing lady, and Rima E. LeBeau MD is the Medical Director of the Natural Solutions Foundation.
[00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:25.960]  She's a graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.066]  1970, believes passionately in the right of every American to choose a personal health path that is free of government and corporate interference.
[00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:34.409]  And if I went through the rest of her bio, 35 years,
[00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.290]  Thank you.
[00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:55.304]  Just giving us a teaser of what's currently happening.
[00:01:55.704 --> 00:02:04.792]  You got back in the last month, but you've been all over the world as of late, from Europe, literally battling against Codex Alimentarius.
[00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:10.797]  For those that don't know what it is, describe what it is and then break down what we're facing and why it's so important.
[00:02:12.038 --> 00:02:12.458]  You bet.
[00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.603]  Codex Alimentarius is not an intestinal parasite, although it sounds like it is.
[00:02:19.298 --> 00:02:24.523]  It's a UN agency, and that should already get your red flags up.
[00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:29.927]  It's a UN agency designed to control the international trade of food.
[00:02:30.307 --> 00:02:47.442]  What that means is setting guidelines and standards and allowing the international industrializers of the food supply, including the genetic engineering folks, Monsanto and Bayer and the others, to set the rules
[00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:51.578]  As to what food needs to be and what it can't be.
[00:02:51.978 --> 00:02:59.164]  And under Codex, what it can't be is wholesome, clean, unadulterated, and health-producing.
[00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:13.436]  Because Codex is actually the creature of the pharmaceutical industry, which wants you to have damaged, degraded, and non-nutritive food filled with toxins so that you become ill.
[00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:16.919]  Then Codex and the FDA, its handmaiden,
[00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:30.271]  We'll make it impossible for you to get high-potency nutrients so that you can protect or repair, protect yourself from or repair the damage that that food does to you.
[00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:46.814]  So what we're talking about is a food system designed to make everybody on the planet, and I do mean everybody on the planet, except of course the controllers, as ill as possible with the highly economically productive diseases
[00:03:47.378 --> 00:03:56.045]  That the pharmaceutical industry makes its amazing profits from cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity.
[00:03:56.105 --> 00:04:04.271]  Those are the diseases that the World Health Organization defines as the chronic diseases of undernutrition.
[00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:16.760]  Take away the nutrition, get people sick, take away natural medicine, make profits, then they die, and you have depopulated the world of the quote, useless eaters.
[00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:21.522]  That's Codex in a nutshell.
[00:04:22.163 --> 00:04:26.307]  Doctor, during the break we may, well, we're going to end it at the end of this break.
[00:04:26.327 --> 00:04:29.410]  Your phone's got a lot of static on it, so we may try to reconnect.
[00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:37.218]  But bottom line, when we say that the globalists, the internationalists have weaponized the food supply, we're not joking around about that.
[00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:39.100]  You're a medical doctor, you've been researching this.
[00:04:40.281 --> 00:05:06.652]  I know that doing your own separate research from mine or others, that you and General Stubblebine have found that indeed it is a population reduction plan, and it's all done through compartmentalization, and that they are indeed cornering the world food supply, buying up the heirloom seeds, while building these doomsday vaults, that they know they're bringing on an environmental holocaust, while in the name of global warming, they're bringing in all this regulation and control over the general public.
[00:05:07.152 --> 00:05:08.153]  Can you speak to that?
[00:05:09.554 --> 00:05:12.957]  Well, let's talk about just genetically engineered food.
[00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:15.960]  Now, most of your listeners are probably in the United States.
[00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:33.878]  Right now, by the way, that's not static, that's torrential rain because I'm in Panama setting up a food system education program to teach farmers and non-farmers how to grow clean, non-genetically modified, wholesome food
[00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:40.919]  In as little as a four foot square area if you're not a farmer or on your farm if you are.
[00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.399]  That's why you hear that tremendous rain.
[00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.480]  Food, let's take genetically modified food.
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:54.682]  80 to 85 percent of everything that Americans typically eat contains genetically modified food components.
[00:05:55.182 --> 00:06:01.324]  The government of Austria last week reduced the study showing that genetically modified corn
[00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:09.072]  The basis of most of our prepared foods causes sterility in laboratory rats.
[00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:12.535]  Now, do you really think that's an accident?
[00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:29.650]  Do you really think that controlling the world's food supply, as Monsanto says that it will do by 2010, and introducing ubiquitous foods that cause sterility, cancer, remember that's profitable,
[00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:30.577]  I don't
[00:06:54.087 --> 00:07:17.915]  Do you really think it's an accident that out of over 200 different types of plastics 55-60 years ago they chose the only plastic that leaches estrogen mimicking hormones that also is linked to sterility and and lowered sperm counts and everywhere in the world where it's used not only are the mammals becoming sterile
[00:07:18.215 --> 00:07:28.339]  But where that water, excreted through sewer systems, is getting into the water, most of the frogs and alligators are being born hermaphrodites.
[00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:33.241]  So again, everything they do, targeting reproduction because they're eugenicists.
[00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:35.242]  That is correct.
[00:07:35.282 --> 00:07:36.302]  They are eugenicists.
[00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:39.724]  They are not food agricultural industrialists.
[00:07:39.924 --> 00:07:45.786]  They are not medical health or illness care system industrialists.
[00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:47.707]  They are eugenicists.
[00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:52.372]  Five years ago, that would get you branded as a lunatic.
[00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:58.514]  Today, more and more people are realizing that they are being targeted for eugenics.
[00:07:58.754 --> 00:08:00.735]  Low eugenics or fast eugenics?
[00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:16.339]  The World Health Organization in 1985 announced in writing, and I have a copy of this document, that the purpose of the supposed smallpox eradication program that they were carrying out at that point
[00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:18.728]  Well, I don't believe any of us is excess
[00:08:40.937 --> 00:09:10.005]  And you must remember the World Health Organization, which is one of the organizations that runs Codex for the United Nations, has just been convicted in the Philippines High Court, that's their Supreme Court, of involuntarily sterilizing three million or more Filipino women through the use of a supposed tetanus vaccine, which actually induces sterility.
[00:09:10.532 --> 00:09:30.163]  What we're talking about is a multi-pronged, evil approach to getting rid of us so that they, whoever they are, and I know that you've talked a lot about who they are, Alex, so that they can control the non-renewable resources of the planet.
[00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:38.848]  And I have this, in fact, from the very mouth of a patient whom I treated, because as a physician I've treated some interesting people.
[00:09:39.232 --> 00:09:56.648]  This woman is a head of state who told me that she'd been raised to believe that it was the way of the world to eliminate the useless eaters because they were consuming their non-renewable natural resources.
[00:09:57.108 --> 00:10:02.473]  Their resources, meaning the resources of the master class.
[00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:05.676]  And I said to her, did it ever occur to you
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.543]  That perhaps those non-renewable resources actually belong to the people who live on the land above them.
[00:10:14.004 --> 00:10:16.665]  And she looked at me and said, Why, no.
[00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:18.186]  It never did.
[00:10:18.206 --> 00:10:20.587]  That's what we're dealing with, Alex.
[00:10:21.867 --> 00:10:30.371]  Well, Bill Subblebine and I would love to talk to you at length about how this all fits together with the coming famine of 2009,
[00:10:32.082 --> 00:10:40.193]  The need to grow your own food in your apartment, on your backyard, or in community gardens, to purchase clean, wholesome, organic food.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.881]  And to push back against the genocidalists before it's too late.
[00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.462]  Well, Dr. Labo, we're about to break.
[00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:48.902]  You've got your book there.
[00:10:48.942 --> 00:10:54.803]  You're set Wednesday, coming up in about 48 hours, to be on with us for an hour.
[00:10:55.204 --> 00:10:56.084]  Do you have your book?
[00:10:56.144 --> 00:11:02.765]  Is there a better time this week where perhaps I could have you guys on for an hour and a half, so we could really flesh all this out?
[00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:09.487]  I would be happy to rearrange my schedule on Wednesday to make sure that we have that hour and a half.
[00:11:10.874 --> 00:11:15.403]  Are we starting at 2 your time or are we starting at 1.30 your time?
[00:11:15.423 --> 00:11:20.893]  1.30 central standard time and so that would be about 45 minutes earlier than we're speaking right now.
[00:11:21.653 --> 00:11:22.474]  You got it.
[00:11:22.614 --> 00:11:24.835]  And meanwhile, let me ask people to go to our website.
[00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:25.356]  Yeah, stay there.
[00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:26.056]  We're going to come back.
[00:11:26.297 --> 00:11:27.518]  Let's come back and do one more segment.
[00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:28.298]  This is too important.
[00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:28.919]  Absolutely.
[00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:29.979]  Go to the website.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.722]  Healthfreedomusa.org.
[00:11:33.762 --> 00:11:36.304]  Healthfreedomusa.org.
[00:11:36.344 --> 00:11:37.545]  Folks, it's all true.
[00:11:37.866 --> 00:11:39.046]  They're murdering all of us.
[00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:40.127]  They're killing your children.
[00:11:40.407 --> 00:11:42.509]  Cops, military, they're poisoning us all.
[00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:45.471]  Everything is weaponized.
[00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:46.892]  We have the documents.
[00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:48.534]  It's all documented.
[00:11:50.035 --> 00:11:50.635]  Okay, here we go.
[00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:51.176]  We'll be right back.
[00:11:52.682 --> 00:11:53.903]  I'm going to skip this break, John.
[00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:59.186]  I'm going to skip it for PrisonPlanet.tv members and the folks listening at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:59.567 --> 00:11:59.927]  Doctor?
[00:11:59.947 --> 00:12:02.549]  Yes, I'm here.
[00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:12.496]  We're on the internet right now, we're just not on the AM and FM dial, and I apologize that we weren't clear in the email that we wanted both of you on, but that always makes for a really interesting interview.
[00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:13.716]  Sure.
[00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:17.078]  When are you in the United States?
[00:12:37.059 --> 00:12:38.340]  We're not.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:44.222]  I will meet your film crew in lots of places, but the United States is not one of them.
[00:12:44.542 --> 00:12:47.183]  I do not want to be in the United States.
[00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:49.004]  So you're staying out of the United States now?
[00:12:50.045 --> 00:12:50.185]  Yep.
[00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:59.789]  We are still fighting the battles in the United States, and one of our trustees, Ralph Fucitola, is in the United States, but I do not feel safe because at any moment
[00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:02.848]  They could lower the compulsory vaccine boom.
[00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:05.110]  And you know what that means.
[00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.654]  Well, I mean, the Washington Post announces they're putting regular army in every town and city.
[00:13:10.135 --> 00:13:10.655]  They are.
[00:13:10.835 --> 00:13:12.077]  It is for the American people.
[00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:12.737]  They admit it.
[00:13:13.078 --> 00:13:14.139]  They're going for broke.
[00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:15.600]  And I agree.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.102]  No, I feel like I mean, it's reckless.
[00:13:18.162 --> 00:13:19.183]  And I'm still even here.
[00:13:20.164 --> 00:13:21.866]  But I can't believe you're there, Alex.
[00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.748]  You could do all your broadcasts from here.
[00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.411]  I know, but I've committed to go down with the ship here.
[00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:31.932]  So I'm going to go down with it.
[00:13:32.172 --> 00:13:33.392]  I may get my family out though.
[00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:34.633]  I've told people that publicly.
[00:13:35.293 --> 00:13:38.434]  Because I don't think the public realizes just how psychopathic the elite are.
[00:13:38.854 --> 00:13:40.595]  And I mean, you're there on air telling them.
[00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:49.920]  That high courts, Indian government, Philippine government, all these governments admit it's happening.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.941]  We have the documents where these people are doing all this.
[00:13:52.462 --> 00:13:56.164]  And I don't think they understand just how serious this is.
[00:13:56.224 --> 00:13:57.905]  I mean, they are soft-killing us.
[00:13:58.245 --> 00:14:06.130]  They're just turning up the ambient background of the soft-kill systems incrementally so the public doesn't notice it.
[00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.491]  I mean, there are children
[00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:11.392]  You bet, and I'd love to come on regularly, Alex.
[00:14:32.315 --> 00:14:32.775]  You know what?
[00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:36.478]  I tell you, we're both having these crazy scheduling problems.
[00:14:36.858 --> 00:14:38.058]  I'm setting this up on air.
[00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:44.502]  I am going to not be doing the third hour, fourth hour on Thursday because I'm on international press TV.
[00:14:45.603 --> 00:14:46.504]  Doc, I apologize.
[00:14:46.524 --> 00:14:48.125]  You know, this happens with these scheduling changes.
[00:14:48.145 --> 00:14:49.105]  Can you look at your book?
[00:14:49.485 --> 00:14:52.287]  Is Thursday good for an hour and a half?
[00:14:53.608 --> 00:14:54.869]  Hang on, let me look back.
[00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:55.569]  Thursday.
[00:14:55.689 --> 00:14:58.031]  Thursday is the fourth, I believe.
[00:14:58.171 --> 00:14:59.792]  Anywhere from eleven to three.
[00:14:59.812 --> 00:15:01.733]  It doesn't have to be in that hour.
[00:15:03.756 --> 00:15:08.237]  Uh, Thursday is actually a really good day for me.
[00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:13.119]  Okay, well let's have you on at... You want to do two hours?
[00:15:13.439 --> 00:15:15.639]  How about 1 to 3 Central on Thursday?
[00:15:15.659 --> 00:15:22.581]  1 to 3 Central is 2 to 4 my time here in Panama and you got it.
[00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:23.721]  Okay, that is set.
[00:15:23.761 --> 00:15:24.762]  That is a done deal.
[00:15:25.082 --> 00:15:27.102]  That's when we're going to do it, okay?
[00:15:27.122 --> 00:15:27.802]  You got it.
[00:15:27.842 --> 00:15:28.883]  They just brought me in a note.
[00:15:28.903 --> 00:15:30.183]  We're going to take off Wednesday.
[00:15:31.674 --> 00:15:32.995]  Yeah, just that last hour.
[00:15:33.055 --> 00:15:36.216]  We're not doing Wednesday, we're doing two hours on Thursday.
[00:15:37.817 --> 00:15:38.077]  Great.
[00:15:38.417 --> 00:15:44.219]  Two hours from 2 to 4 my time.
[00:15:44.439 --> 00:15:47.741]  Yes, and from 1 to 3 Central Standard Time.
[00:15:47.761 --> 00:15:50.902]  1 to 3 Central Standard Time.
[00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:51.923]  Okay, here we go.
[00:15:51.983 --> 00:15:52.803]  Final segment, here we go.
[00:16:02.915 --> 00:16:05.839]  I think this song is apropos of what we're talking about right now.
[00:16:07.261 --> 00:16:08.642]  Sending out an SOS.
[00:16:08.923 --> 00:16:09.564]  God.
[00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:14.330]  I mean, I've been to the FEMA camps, folks.
[00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.254]  I can't believe what they've done to this country.
[00:16:20.148 --> 00:16:23.570]  You know, they know we have a blind spot to not be able to imagine such evil.
[00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.851]  Not to be able to deal with such wickedness.
[00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:32.433]  We've had a schedule change on my end, and I apologize for the confusion.
[00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:33.594]  It's all my fault here.
[00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:39.957]  I'm going to be on press TV in that fourth hour on Wednesday, so we're going to give you two hours
[00:16:40.817 --> 00:16:42.799]  of the Doctor and the Major General Stubblemine.
[00:16:43.119 --> 00:16:46.521]  Appreciate them giving us those two hours on Thursday.
[00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:52.806]  It's set in stone, 1 to 3 Central, that's 2 to 4 Panama time.
[00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:57.909]  Be sure and check out their website, healthfreedomusa.org.
[00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:01.632]  Just life-saving information there, and we'll do two hours on Thursday.
[00:17:01.672 --> 00:17:02.973]  In the five minutes we've got left,
[00:17:03.573 --> 00:17:12.820]  You've told the story, many other medical doctors I've had on the show have told the story, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago, like Dr. Monteith, you know, he's been a doctor for 50 years.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:22.662]  About a child with cancer, when he was going to medical school 45-50 years ago, was like finding a leprechaun, or a unicorn.
[00:17:22.682 --> 00:17:25.502]  I mean, it was like finding... it didn't exist.
[00:17:26.123 --> 00:17:31.084]  And now, just dead kids, kids with brain tumors, left, right, all around us.
[00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:35.345]  Everything, the cell phones, the plastics, all by design.
[00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:38.105]  And of course, you've told a similar story.
[00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:40.946]  Explain to people what's happening, briefly.
[00:17:42.048 --> 00:18:09.738]  What's happening is that the life expectancy of children born in the year 2000 and thereafter is dropping, so that for the first time in human history, we can expect that a child born in 2000 or thereafter will die before its parents on average, because the food is contaminated, because children are given cell phones, because cell towers
[00:18:10.248 --> 00:18:10.568]  I think?
[00:18:38.815 --> 00:18:40.016]  Well, that's the next issue.
[00:18:40.116 --> 00:18:51.227]  I mean, they just come out now and say that melamine is now not bad for you, and it's at 90% of the baby formula in Associated Press, and they admit, yeah, Coca-Cola's got pesticide in it, but the pesticide's good for you.
[00:18:52.735 --> 00:19:05.325]  And on mainstream TV, we see a clip that says that Mercury may actually promote behavioral competence and increase the IQ.
[00:19:05.365 --> 00:19:08.568]  This is one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life.
[00:19:08.888 --> 00:19:11.230]  So lies are the order of the day.
[00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:18.375]  We live in the Orwellian world of truth disguised as lies and lies disguised as truth.
[00:19:18.435 --> 00:19:20.517]  And if it weren't for people like you, Alex,
[00:19:20.928 --> 00:19:28.274]  And I hope for people like us, the reality would simply not be available to us.
[00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:33.358]  On one day, the FDA said that melamine has no safe level.
[00:19:33.678 --> 00:19:36.360]  It is not possible to have a safe level of melamine.
[00:19:36.701 --> 00:19:44.427]  The next day, melamine has been fed at one part per million with no science, no testing, no safety assurance.
[00:19:44.887 --> 00:19:46.128]  Just like fluoride!
[00:19:46.188 --> 00:19:46.969]  Just like fluoride!
[00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.990]  And to cover it up!
[00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.177]  Like they did with fluoride leakage killing people all over Tennessee is how it all started.
[00:19:53.497 --> 00:19:56.602]  They may just start adding it saying it's a nutrient we've got to have.
[00:19:57.102 --> 00:20:02.490]  On national news they're recommending adding statins forcibly to all the water.
[00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.392]  Did you see that doctor?
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.501]  I missed that one, but I'll tell you what.
[00:20:06.782 --> 00:20:13.746]  Getting statins to children, quote, protectively, is beyond anything the Germans did.
[00:20:14.127 --> 00:20:33.060]  Beyond anything these people did, even during the days of their Action 4 program, where they were killing German children, starting at zero, and going to 17, and then adding in the rest of the population, because they wanted to purify the German race when they had defective Germans.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.822]  What we're doing now is worse than anything that the Nazis... It's Hellraiser!
[00:20:39.182 --> 00:20:44.003]  Hellraiser is going on all around you, or like something out of Event Horizon.
[00:20:44.843 --> 00:20:51.045]  Literally a mind like that is running things, and it's all systematically ambient background tyranny.
[00:20:51.305 --> 00:20:56.747]  It's just been slowly turned up like the frog in the pot, and now they're just savagely pounding us.
[00:20:56.967 --> 00:20:57.407]  Bam!
[00:20:57.447 --> 00:20:57.887]  Bam!
[00:20:58.667 --> 00:20:59.228]  Unbelievable.
[00:20:59.388 --> 00:21:00.748]  That is absolutely correct.
[00:21:01.187 --> 00:21:08.174]  I wish I could disagree with you and say that you're an alarmist, Alex, or that you're misinterpreting information, or that you're exaggerating.
[00:21:08.234 --> 00:21:17.103]  Unfortunately, I believe that you are saying things exactly as they are, and that's what we at the Natural Solutions Foundation do.
[00:21:17.183 --> 00:21:23.049]  Now, I know that you are probably attacked as an alarmist, and so on and so on, and so are we.
[00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:35.894]  Uh, two of the folks who ought to be saying, uh, who ought to be truth-telling, went on the radio to say absolutely extraordinarily horrific lies about us.
[00:21:35.934 --> 00:21:36.554]  But you know what?
[00:21:37.135 --> 00:21:40.777]  That is how the system... Hold on one moment!
[00:21:40.797 --> 00:21:41.458]  Hold on one moment!
[00:21:41.658 --> 00:21:42.579]  We're on the march.
[00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:44.660]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:45.561 --> 00:21:48.363]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:51.405 --> 00:21:52.246]  Uh, let me talk to the dog.
[00:21:52.266 --> 00:21:53.267]  I'm gonna keep going here.
[00:21:56.963 --> 00:21:57.703]  Dr. Lebeau?
[00:21:58.704 --> 00:21:58.924]  Yes.
[00:21:59.425 --> 00:22:01.366]  Listen, we're going to end it right here.
[00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:03.287]  I am so honored to have had you on.
[00:22:03.347 --> 00:22:05.048]  Sorry I got things confused.
[00:22:05.608 --> 00:22:07.730]  Oh no, it's not a problem, Alex.
[00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.811]  We'll do it together on Thursday.
[00:22:10.171 --> 00:22:10.391]  Yes.
[00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:18.136]  And can we give people our website so they can kind of check out what's going on and sign up for the free Health Freedom eAlerts?
[00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:28.861]  Yeah, what I'm going to do is I'm going to come back after you're gone, and I'm going to tell them to go sign up for the free e-alerts, and just nail that down two hours on Thursday, and we'll see you then.
[00:22:29.161 --> 00:22:30.842]  And we're going to call this number, correct?
[00:22:32.463 --> 00:22:33.944]  Yes.
[00:22:35.244 --> 00:22:41.408]  And I'm going to make sure, because of Murphy's Law, that we're going to give you our backup number as well, okay?
[00:22:42.548 --> 00:22:43.569]  Perfect.
[00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:44.089]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:22:44.349 --> 00:22:47.531]  Hey, thank you so much, and I'll talk to you in 48... well, no, it's...
[00:22:48.627 --> 00:22:51.530]  It's in three days, so we'll talk to you Thursday.
[00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:53.632]  Excellent.
[00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:54.492]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:22:54.592 --> 00:22:55.053]  Thank you, doctor.
[00:22:55.093 --> 00:22:55.393]  Take care.
[00:22:56.014 --> 00:22:57.295]  Okay, folks, we're going to come back.
[00:22:57.355 --> 00:23:02.860]  I'm going to allow myself a lavish two-minute break here to go to the little boy's room.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:13.229]  You know, I think fitting into this whole Hellraiser theme, and that's what it is, by the elites, come in with the... You didn't play while I was gone.
[00:23:15.571 --> 00:23:18.740]  That one intro where Walter Cronkite's talking about how much he loves Satan?
[00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:19.963]  No, I did not play that.
[00:23:20.003 --> 00:23:21.848]  Yeah, let's play that one for folks, okay?
[00:23:22.069 --> 00:23:22.250]  Okay.
[00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.711]  Thank you.
[00:23:25.284 --> 00:23:35.151]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much much more.
[00:23:35.371 --> 00:23:36.131]  Fabled enemies.
[00:23:36.612 --> 00:23:43.896]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:23:44.376 --> 00:23:47.719]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:23:51.892 --> 00:24:03.577]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve Foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[00:24:05.503 --> 00:24:06.824]  Pre-Inauguration Special.
[00:24:07.364 --> 00:24:14.108]  Between now and January 20th, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[00:24:14.588 --> 00:24:16.129]  That's a 33% savings.
[00:24:16.449 --> 00:24:19.731]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:29.396]  Ready Reserve Food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, allowing a 15 plus year shelf life.
[00:24:29.876 --> 00:24:33.298]  Ready Reserve has been manufacturing since 1972, giving them the freedom to offer you
[00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:42.213]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually
[00:25:04.122 --> 00:25:04.942]  Too many kids
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.103]  Are what's making the planet worse?
[00:25:35.363 --> 00:25:37.587]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:25:37.707 --> 00:25:40.172]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:25:42.341 --> 00:25:48.303]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:25:48.683 --> 00:25:55.486]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:25:55.586 --> 00:26:00.588]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:26:00.748 --> 00:26:03.449]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:07.711]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[00:26:07.811 --> 00:26:10.752]  We have to work the dark side, or we're going to spend time in the shadows.
[00:26:12.097 --> 00:26:16.001]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:26:16.201 --> 00:26:16.881]  Well, join me.
[00:26:17.422 --> 00:26:19.524]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:26:19.804 --> 00:26:21.625]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:29.412]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:55.476]  I know there's a lot of people out there that try to deny the issues we cover out of fear.
[00:26:57.317 --> 00:27:00.439]  Because there are real monsters in this world.
[00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:03.660]  And they control the heights above us.
[00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:11.264]  They introduce the poisons into the food supply, the water we drink, the air we breathe.
[00:27:12.445 --> 00:27:15.747]  They are releasing plagues upon the earth.
[00:27:17.182 --> 00:27:19.383]  They are drunk on the blood of billions.
[00:27:20.023 --> 00:27:32.688]  They have sold us that hundreds of millions of aborted children is a beautiful thing, that euthanized elderly is a wonderful right, that sodium fluoride and GMO foods
[00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:38.087]  Small children with cell phones microwaving their brains is good.
[00:27:38.967 --> 00:27:48.135]  And rather than reject their lie, we're so afraid we say, I'll just rationalize to myself and say that everything's okay and the New World Order loves me.
[00:27:48.955 --> 00:27:53.920]  Gene in Texas, John in Virginia, and others that are holding, we're going to take your calls for the balance of the show.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.743]  You know, I had a lot of notes that I wrote up last night.
[00:28:00.694 --> 00:28:02.555]  One of my daughter's doodles on the back.
[00:28:06.937 --> 00:28:15.922]  Three pages of handwritten and typed notes that I meant to go over, and it's all just too important to do it at the end of the show because I'm exhausted right now for some reason.
[00:28:19.444 --> 00:28:23.867]  It doesn't even bother me when people attack me for my own self.
[00:28:23.967 --> 00:28:24.807]  I don't even care.
[00:28:27.128 --> 00:28:29.950]  Facing all of this, like, blasts your ego away.
[00:28:30.984 --> 00:28:35.747]  I mean, I'd love to be able to enjoy my little status and people knowing who I am.
[00:28:35.827 --> 00:28:42.891]  I'd love to be able to, you know, be a guy out doing good work, but still enjoying it and enjoying the fight.
[00:28:43.011 --> 00:28:47.894]  I don't enjoy any of it.
[00:28:47.914 --> 00:28:53.938]  I take heart in the children we save from CPS by educating parents about the traps.
[00:28:54.904 --> 00:29:01.707]  Or get people that get off of GMO foods, or at least reduce it, or people that don't vaccinate their children, or people that find out.
[00:29:04.089 --> 00:29:11.872]  But it's like, I'm so busy trying to warn other people that don't know that, you know, as we save people, for every person we save, we lose a thousand.
[00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:18.716]  And so I'm just so focused on all the carnage and destruction I see, and all the horrible things I see happening to humanity, that
[00:29:21.345 --> 00:29:28.728]  I mean, I can't go eat fajitas and enjoy myself without feeling guilty for even enjoying myself.
[00:29:28.748 --> 00:29:29.628]  I don't know how to explain it.
[00:29:30.248 --> 00:29:41.572]  I can't even take off and go see a movie now because all I'm thinking about is the New World Order and all the stuff they're doing and how my going to a movie normalizes all of this.
[00:29:41.972 --> 00:29:47.434]  We should be in the streets freaking out, pulling our hair out, but they just incrementally turn the tyranny up.
[00:29:49.548 --> 00:29:52.090]  To where, you know, even I am acting insane.
[00:29:52.851 --> 00:29:55.934]  This is an insanely calm response to what they're doing.
[00:29:56.655 --> 00:30:04.983]  I mean, it's bad that they're putting fluoride in the water, and they knew it gave people cancer, and attack their glands, and reduce their IQ by 20 points on average.
[00:30:05.664 --> 00:30:07.866]  I mean, that right there is mind-blowing!
[00:30:10.255 --> 00:30:13.156]  And now they're saying, yeah, melamine's good for you, mercury's good for you.
[00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:15.477]  Well, we used to say it was poison, but now it's good.
[00:30:15.837 --> 00:30:17.017]  Oh, you're dying!
[00:30:17.077 --> 00:30:18.218]  Dying is good!
[00:30:19.118 --> 00:30:20.198]  It's psych warfare!
[00:30:20.238 --> 00:30:34.963]  They're just throwing everything in our... And, you know, I can go read all the behavioral psychologists and psychiatrists and study it and everything from Freud to Jung to Bernays, right through to the modern stuff, and they are practicing just savage
[00:30:36.605 --> 00:30:50.346]  It's an art form, combinations of all these different psychological schools, and brainwashing techniques, and TV, and neuro-linguistic programming, and just subliminals, just targeting, just blasting people.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.806]  To where we all just as they ambient, you know, background noise, like crickets, is an ambient sound.
[00:31:00.247 --> 00:31:03.932]  And then they get louder, and louder, and louder, and louder, until it just shatters your eardrums.
[00:31:03.952 --> 00:31:04.813]  You know, that's the analogy.
[00:31:05.093 --> 00:31:09.038]  They're just slowly turning the sound up, slowly.
[00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:12.243]  But now it's already, now they're starting to crank it even faster.
[00:31:15.404 --> 00:31:25.368]  And it's not ambient anymore, it's blaring all around us, tyrannies everywhere and people are kind of waking up but they still have no idea how deep it is.
[00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:37.994]  And it's so sick when you read Prince Philip or Ted Turner or all these UN chiefs or Jacques Cousteau
[00:31:39.635 --> 00:31:42.036]  Or Eric Pianca or a Peter Singer.
[00:31:42.656 --> 00:31:47.437]  There's thousands of them all writing books and papers about how 90% of us need to be killed.
[00:31:47.477 --> 00:31:48.257]  That's one school.
[00:31:48.317 --> 00:31:50.938]  The government policies, 80% of us need to be killed.
[00:31:51.678 --> 00:31:55.119]  And then now they're losing ground to the suicidal nihilists.
[00:31:55.139 --> 00:31:56.220]  That's really what it's all about.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.761]  And these top scientists will like be writing public papers.
[00:32:01.561 --> 00:32:03.202]  And then they'll just say, I just love death.
[00:32:03.222 --> 00:32:04.022]  I just want to kill.
[00:32:07.363 --> 00:32:08.363]  I mean, that's like Pianca.
[00:32:10.199 --> 00:32:13.563]  He's sitting there and he's going, oh, I love Lucifer, on the UT website.
[00:32:13.583 --> 00:32:21.813]  It's all about how they've got to kill us and get rid of us, and then he's dressed up in a druid outfit, going, I love Lucifer, on the UT website.
[00:32:21.833 --> 00:32:23.134]  I mean, it's craziness!
[00:32:23.154 --> 00:32:26.719]  This guy's running around, getting standing ovations, saying, kill everybody!
[00:32:29.428 --> 00:32:34.750]  And then his students send me threatening emails, and send me their white papers, send me their Ph.D.
[00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:39.311]  papers, and then I Google their name, and it's them in lab coats at bio-weapons labs.
[00:32:40.112 --> 00:32:50.956]  And the white papers, his graduate students, send me, you know, I wrote this five years ago, you piece of filth, and he's actually a moderate.
[00:32:50.996 --> 00:32:53.636]  I believe in total human extinction.
[00:32:53.677 --> 00:32:54.797]  We are a parasite.
[00:32:56.852 --> 00:32:57.492]  They're everywhere!
[00:32:57.512 --> 00:32:58.392]  They run it all!
[00:32:58.733 --> 00:33:00.833]  It's this base power trip.
[00:33:00.873 --> 00:33:04.034]  And you talk to these people, at the end of the day, they're not even that smart.
[00:33:04.494 --> 00:33:05.815]  They are just wicked.
[00:33:05.875 --> 00:33:08.915]  They just like, oh, we will kill everyone.
[00:33:09.316 --> 00:33:10.136]  Oh, yes.
[00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:12.437]  It's a, you don't understand.
[00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:15.777]  I mean, you know, that's the, you don't understand.
[00:33:16.098 --> 00:33:24.160]  It's like, I just want to, you know, that's the response to these people is just clean them out!
[00:33:26.032 --> 00:33:28.496]  They declare war on us, we declare war on them!
[00:33:29.517 --> 00:33:30.900]  This isn't a game, people!
[00:33:40.475 --> 00:33:42.516]  So I do everything I can to break people out of their trance.
[00:33:42.536 --> 00:33:44.436]  People say, oh don't get so excited, don't get upset.
[00:33:44.636 --> 00:33:46.657]  You're only allowed to get excited about the football game.
[00:33:46.977 --> 00:33:51.158]  That's when you're supposed to paint yourself up in war paint and simulated warfare.
[00:33:51.858 --> 00:33:59.520]  And it kind of tickles your mind and feels satisfying while you're there because that's an instinct to war, to defend yourself from oppression and enslavement.
[00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.501]  And they just make it into some little prosthesis, some little toy.
[00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.662]  I use the analogy of it's like a blow-up doll.
[00:34:07.483 --> 00:34:10.425]  It's like a man who doesn't go out and actually find a mate and build a family.
[00:34:10.705 --> 00:34:11.846]  No, he has a blow-up doll.
[00:34:12.286 --> 00:34:20.391]  And blow-up dolls are what sports are to men's instincts to resist and fight.
[00:34:22.152 --> 00:34:22.672]  You understand?
[00:34:23.993 --> 00:34:30.557]  Sports is like a man going out, instead of getting a woman, it's like a man going out and taking his blow-up doll to dinner.
[00:34:32.178 --> 00:34:34.199]  And buying his blow-up doll diamond rings.
[00:34:35.788 --> 00:34:37.890]  And buying his blow-up doll insurance.
[00:34:40.513 --> 00:34:41.614]  That's what sports is.
[00:34:42.795 --> 00:34:46.459]  It's a facsimile of warfare, a facsimile of human aggression.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.781]  You have those instincts for a reason.
[00:34:49.422 --> 00:34:53.606]  But they tell you, oh, be nice in politics, be nice in culture, shut up, lay down.
[00:34:53.626 --> 00:34:57.891]  But the government isn't nice, with all their militarized police and the troops and all the rest of it.
[00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.153]  See, only the government's allowed to be violent with you and aggressive.
[00:35:03.493 --> 00:35:10.358]  And then the only place a human being, a slave, is allowed to be speaking out publicly.
[00:35:19.346 --> 00:35:21.427]  It's crazy in here what's going on with guests today.
[00:35:22.108 --> 00:35:25.771]  I've got an IM here saying, Mike Adams from the Health Ranger, let me know if you want him on.
[00:35:26.573 --> 00:35:27.413]  Just dropped off.
[00:35:28.114 --> 00:35:29.414]  Somebody set him up today?
[00:35:29.454 --> 00:35:30.675]  What's going on with all these guests?
[00:35:31.155 --> 00:35:31.455]  No, no, no.
[00:35:31.495 --> 00:35:32.596]  He just called into the show.
[00:35:33.557 --> 00:35:34.577]  Oh, he wanted to comment.
[00:35:36.838 --> 00:35:37.659]  Okay, I didn't know that.
[00:35:37.699 --> 00:35:42.741]  We'll call him back and make sure he knows that I wasn't ignoring his call, but that I wanted to get him on the show.
[00:35:43.421 --> 00:35:44.362]  Okay, that was strange then.
[00:35:46.035 --> 00:35:47.396]  You know folks, I'm going to tell you something.
[00:35:47.476 --> 00:35:59.083]  All this eugenics and extermination and evil is going on, and it's targeting you and your family, and I know that's heavy, and I know that's hard to deal with, but we've got to get out of this mind-numbed thing we're in.
[00:36:01.414 --> 00:36:22.382]  We have got to get out of this mind-numbed position where we've just been taught to accept this, and then all the props, all the facades of liberty and freedom that they had up while they were building this technological murder system, this technological enslavement extermination grid, they're now pulling out all the facades and all the props, and all that's left is the tyranny.
[00:36:32.882 --> 00:36:33.423]  Oh God.
[00:36:34.845 --> 00:36:37.550]  Let me plug some sponsors and then we'll go to your calls here at the end of the show.
[00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:47.365]  Yeah, these sponsors all make the show possible.
[00:36:48.922 --> 00:36:50.963]  People I endorse, and I think you ought to check them out.
[00:36:51.343 --> 00:36:52.484]  One of them is eFoods Direct.
[00:36:52.504 --> 00:36:56.206]  You know, there's a lot of storable foods companies out there, but this is where I chose to get my storable foods.
[00:36:56.266 --> 00:36:58.847]  It's really high quality, freeze-dried and dehydrated.
[00:36:59.728 --> 00:37:02.870]  And it takes a big piece of the puzzle away from the enemy.
[00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.952]  They can't control you if you've got arms and you've got food and you're willing to defend it.
[00:37:07.932 --> 00:37:08.573]  That's how they do it.
[00:37:08.593 --> 00:37:12.276]  They cut the power and the water and the food off and make you come groveling to them.
[00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:14.878]  So give eFoodsDirect a call.
[00:37:14.898 --> 00:37:17.561]  Get one of their free catalogs, get one of their audio or video CDs.
[00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:19.022]  But don't screw around.
[00:37:19.062 --> 00:37:20.984]  Go ahead and order food today, folks.
[00:37:21.004 --> 00:37:21.524]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:37:21.544 --> 00:37:23.045]  There are big banners up at the top of InfoWars.com.
[00:37:30.652 --> 00:37:34.874]  and PrisonPlanet.com for the fine folks at eFoodsDirect.
[00:37:34.915 --> 00:37:40.918]  So that number again is 800-409-5633 or the letter E, foodsdirect.com.
[00:37:41.999 --> 00:37:44.340]  And dovetailing with that is a Cola Blue.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.082]  A Cola Blue is just a fabulous atmospheric water generator.
[00:37:49.103 --> 00:37:50.964]  It grabs water out of the air.
[00:37:50.984 --> 00:37:58.208]  I've actually gotten emails from people saying, there's no way the thing just gets water without being hooked up to pipes.
[00:37:59.051 --> 00:38:10.642]  Yeah folks, there's water in the air, that's what clouds are, and I promise you, it's like you see a bottle of cold drink out and then water condensates on it, that's how it works.
[00:38:10.662 --> 00:38:14.425]  7.5 gallons a day, 866-585-4044, 866-585-4044, you've heard Willie Nelson talk about this, coloblue.com, E-C-O-L-O, blue dot com.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.641]  And great tasting pure H2O, and then it goes through five filters.
[00:38:29.362 --> 00:38:32.423]  No fluoride, no nothing, and believe me, the establishment doesn't like it.
[00:38:33.424 --> 00:38:36.945]  They don't like it when women breastfeed their children and don't drink the plastic poison.
[00:38:37.405 --> 00:38:39.986]  They don't like it when you stop drinking their poison water.
[00:38:40.006 --> 00:38:41.187]  They don't like it when you don't eat their GMO.
[00:38:41.207 --> 00:38:47.910]  So, 866-585-4044 or coloblue.com.
[00:38:56.181 --> 00:39:02.763]  And then dovetailing still continually with the eFoodsDirect.com is FoodShortageUSA.com.
[00:39:03.604 --> 00:39:05.664]  Food Shortage USA is not eFoodsDirect.
[00:39:05.804 --> 00:39:12.387]  It's another fine outfit that has videos and books and materials available at FoodShortageUSA.com.
[00:39:14.289 --> 00:39:20.373]  So that you can learn inexpensively how to store your own foods and what type of foods keep well and it's just the basics of that.
[00:39:20.393 --> 00:39:21.294]  It's a good place to start.
[00:39:21.354 --> 00:39:28.018]  FoodShortageUSA.com to learn how to make your own storable foods for you and your family to prepare for the road ahead.
[00:39:28.038 --> 00:39:32.001]  The website reveals a step-by-step way for the average guy to get prepared for what's ahead.
[00:39:32.301 --> 00:39:37.144]  I think the best part of the system is that it gets you off the food grid even if you don't have a lot of money to spend.
[00:39:37.204 --> 00:39:39.005]  The site is FoodShortageUSA.com.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.481]  It's not too late.
[00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:47.365]  You can still prepare by learning how to make your own survival foods and you can do it for pennies on the dollar.
[00:39:47.425 --> 00:39:50.007]  Go to FoodShortageUSA.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:39:50.327 --> 00:39:53.470]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:58.754]  Alright, let's take calls here for the balance of the show.
[00:40:01.776 --> 00:40:02.937]  Who is up next here?
[00:40:03.037 --> 00:40:04.318]  Jean in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:40:04.358 --> 00:40:04.919]  Thanks for holding.
[00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:06.580]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:40:08.099 --> 00:40:09.620]  It's great to be able to talk to you.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:18.664]  I was hoping to talk to Lindsey or ask him a question, but since he's gone and Dr. Labo's gone, I'll just turn it into a fan call for you.
[00:40:18.684 --> 00:40:20.545]  Well, you can ask me the question, too.
[00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:21.025]  I might know.
[00:40:22.165 --> 00:40:32.370]  Well, it was about Lindsey's last visit to your show a couple of weeks ago, and he said something about crashing the U.S.
[00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:37.292]  economy, etc., and then it seemed like he said something about
[00:40:38.925 --> 00:40:45.890]  Pumping up the Russian economy to make them the first world country and us the third world country.
[00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.271]  No, no, Russia and China.
[00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:51.074]  Yes, that is the stated trilateral commission plan.
[00:40:51.654 --> 00:40:57.478]  See, they're building world government out of our taxes, our money, our troops, while blaming us for all the tyranny.
[00:40:57.758 --> 00:41:06.805]  Then they're going to implode the U.S., make us a third world police state, they're done with us, and they're going to move on into their world government, based in Europe, Russia and China.
[00:41:09.096 --> 00:41:11.437]  Well, my next question is, should we run over there?
[00:41:12.558 --> 00:41:14.419]  Oh no, it's going to be horrible there, too, as well.
[00:41:15.019 --> 00:41:17.141]  They're waging war against humanity.
[00:41:17.181 --> 00:41:19.102]  They're attacking everybody with eugenics.
[00:41:19.662 --> 00:41:21.903]  Yeah, well, I can relate to that.
[00:41:21.983 --> 00:41:25.685]  I'm on board with Dr. Labo.
[00:41:25.725 --> 00:41:31.349]  In fact, I get her emails and I get on the phone with my congressman.
[00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:36.952]  I've done all that kind of stuff every time she sends something out, so I'm fully aware of that one.
[00:41:37.939 --> 00:41:46.483]  Yeah, you can go to their website and sign up for email alerts for listeners.
[00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:49.205]  I promised to plug that and I hadn't done that yet.
[00:41:51.146 --> 00:41:53.667]  And I just wanted to say also, thank you.
[00:41:54.307 --> 00:41:55.768]  You are the one who woke me up.
[00:41:56.168 --> 00:41:57.529]  I found you on YouTube.
[00:41:57.549 --> 00:42:05.053]  I kind of knew that I really hated certain things going on in the government.
[00:42:05.999 --> 00:42:18.110]  For several presidents now in succession, but I didn't really know or could put a reason to why all that was, but you certainly have educated me and I want to thank you for that.
[00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.473]  All the guests you have, your knowledge, everything.
[00:42:21.734 --> 00:42:25.037]  I'm so happy that I'm able to get in touch with your program.
[00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:27.138]  Well, we appreciate you too, Jean.
[00:42:27.299 --> 00:42:28.240]  Good to hear from you.
[00:42:29.395 --> 00:42:38.559]  I'm gonna, for the InfoWars.com listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, in the interest of time, I'm gonna skip this break and we'll be back for the MNFMs in three minutes with final phone calls.
[00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:48.323]  I'll be on coast-to-coast AM in the first hour tonight talking about the open announcement of troops to be stationed in every town and city, and they are being trained to take your firearms.
[00:42:49.364 --> 00:42:49.804]  Stay with us.
[00:42:52.722 --> 00:42:56.404]  Okay, uh... John, you used to talk to the internet audience.
[00:42:56.424 --> 00:42:58.464]  Appreciate you holding, uh, John in Virginia.
[00:42:58.925 --> 00:42:59.625]  John just hung up.
[00:42:59.965 --> 00:43:01.986]  Zach in Hawaii, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:06.468]  Hey Zach, go ahead.
[00:43:08.008 --> 00:43:08.329]  Hello?
[00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:09.569]  Yes, Zach, you're on the air.
[00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:21.194]  Um, yes, I wanted to talk about, um, the peace and the fact that there's a lot of people going towards the movement that you're talking about and, uh,
[00:43:21.934 --> 00:43:23.755]  And I don't just mean that you're talking about.
[00:43:23.795 --> 00:43:27.117]  I mean, I come to these conclusions from just looking at history and whatnot.
[00:43:27.717 --> 00:43:39.083]  And if we don't maintain peace, which has always been a good thing in the civil rights movement, it'll change everything.
[00:43:39.123 --> 00:43:47.227]  Because their amount of recruits they have that are brainwashed is a huge amount of the problem.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:56.529]  And in an amount that are so brainwashed that they're beyond repair or, you know, they're just never gonna turn.
[00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:00.160]  They already are for world government.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:10.345]  Well, there's a lot of people, too, who've been busy saying we're liars and government's only good and sweet and doesn't do anything bad and there's no global combine of banks and there's none of this happening.
[00:44:10.805 --> 00:44:19.489]  Now that it's all being announced, they still have to say it's not happening, because for them it's about an argument, like a football game, of who's right and who's wrong.
[00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:28.358]  So they're committed to lying and going along with the corruption because deep down they're scared to death so they can't admit it's real.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.681]  Yes, exactly.
[00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:43.634]  So getting them to change their minds before going into some kind of conflict on a domestic level or anything like that is a must and then you pretty much transform
[00:44:44.642 --> 00:44:50.070]  Using propaganda on using truth and propaganda instead of just bullshit.
[00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:52.634]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:44:55.819 --> 00:45:00.142]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[00:45:01.222 --> 00:45:08.306]  Let's go ahead and speak with, well we're going to be coming out of break here in a moment, so I'll just wait to go to the full audience.
[00:45:10.087 --> 00:45:12.629]  See, that's another form of false rebellion, what that guy just did.
[00:45:12.649 --> 00:45:13.509]  He did that on purpose.
[00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.511]  Whatever man, you're on the internet.
[00:45:17.708 --> 00:45:20.489]  Thinking that that's a totem of power doing that.
[00:45:20.509 --> 00:45:21.809]  That's a form of rebellion.
[00:45:22.489 --> 00:45:23.229]  And it's not really.
[00:45:23.289 --> 00:45:25.750]  I mean, you know, I'm not against tattoos and earrings and all that stuff.
[00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:26.330]  I don't care.
[00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.430]  I'm not even criticizing them.
[00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.891]  I understand people like them.
[00:45:28.911 --> 00:45:29.631]  People are into them.
[00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:31.491]  Fetishes, you know, for things like that.
[00:45:31.551 --> 00:45:31.932]  Whatever.
[00:45:32.232 --> 00:45:33.272]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[00:45:33.672 --> 00:45:38.993]  I'm saying that for some people, that's about who they are instead of their ideas.
[00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:44.575]  And I want people to rebel against the tyranny and rebel against the right things.
[00:45:48.595 --> 00:45:49.796]  That's all I'm trying to say here.
[00:45:49.976 --> 00:45:50.296]  Here we go.
[00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:21.130]  Oh yeah, sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
[00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.292]  Barack Obama.
[00:46:24.673 --> 00:46:28.135]  This whole cabinet is a bunch of warmongering killers.
[00:46:28.876 --> 00:46:29.396]  They're coming.
[00:46:40.503 --> 00:46:42.585]  But intentions can be evil.
[00:46:43.385 --> 00:46:47.989]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Lynn in California.
[00:46:48.529 --> 00:46:49.370]  You're on the air, Lynn.
[00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.030]  Thanks for holding.
[00:46:51.892 --> 00:46:53.193]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:46:53.593 --> 00:46:58.597]  This is my first time ever, well, I think about my third time listening to your show.
[00:46:59.418 --> 00:47:01.199]  And I'm very glad that I got through.
[00:47:01.219 --> 00:47:05.322]  I just wanted to say earlier, make a comment.
[00:47:06.563 --> 00:47:09.785]  When the guy was talking, had brought up something about
[00:47:12.276 --> 00:47:21.438]  Uh, I think when you had the minister on, and he brought up something about how, you know, about you just want to sell your books, or brought up possibly wanting to sell your books and stuff.
[00:47:22.358 --> 00:47:25.718]  I wanted to make a comment to, I guess if he's still listening.
[00:47:26.919 --> 00:47:39.721]  Everything that you have talked about, at other people similar to you, in your field, and on this subject, of this one world order, and all the other things that are going on this planet, have already happened.
[00:47:41.263 --> 00:47:42.824]  And they've been happening for the longest.
[00:47:43.744 --> 00:47:45.245]  And right now, it's accentuating.
[00:47:46.386 --> 00:47:48.166]  But I can tell him this.
[00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:53.729]  I have suffered firsthand from everything what you've talked about.
[00:47:53.929 --> 00:47:54.589]  Very similar.
[00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:58.772]  And I'm not of any political affiliation or any type of person.
[00:47:59.072 --> 00:48:00.312]  But I lost my own child.
[00:48:00.332 --> 00:48:02.533]  I was viciously murdered in Texas.
[00:48:02.673 --> 00:48:04.154]  And it was a big cover-up behind it.
[00:48:04.454 --> 00:48:05.515]  A very big one.
[00:48:05.535 --> 00:48:06.435]  No, I'm sorry to hear that.
[00:48:07.296 --> 00:48:08.756]  Involving even the feds.
[00:48:09.617 --> 00:48:09.737]  Hmm.
[00:48:10.231 --> 00:48:18.117]  An undercover agent even came to one of my relatives, my aunt, and told her that it would jeopardize lives and positions if the truth came out.
[00:48:18.157 --> 00:48:27.244]  They were doing investigations throughout all those murders that were going on in Texas, but especially in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, of those kids, especially during that, in the 90s.
[00:48:29.486 --> 00:48:37.852]  And right to this day, we're fighting for some land that was illegally taken from one of my ancestors.
[00:48:38.985 --> 00:48:41.066]  In the early 1900s, but up to this day.
[00:48:42.487 --> 00:48:47.570]  Over 16,000 acres of prime oil and gas with coal and lignite.
[00:48:48.351 --> 00:48:55.515]  And yet, these oil companies have went in there, cut some type of deal, went in there all the way over to China.
[00:48:56.316 --> 00:49:01.559]  Now I got the proof on that.
[00:49:02.219 --> 00:49:02.759]  16,000.688.08 acres.
[00:49:02.879 --> 00:49:03.660]  And I can show you proof.
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.361]  There's three other people that I have that's true.
[00:49:05.641 --> 00:49:08.643]  And they had it hidden under a relative's wife.
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:12.023]  And then as soon as we found it, we couldn't find any of it.
[00:49:12.083 --> 00:49:19.830]  The panel was just spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars getting these different lawyers, even two ex-judges in Texas, even a politician there in Texas.
[00:49:20.731 --> 00:49:29.200]  They claim they couldn't find anything, but yet we, I have it, and two other people have proof where they had committed fraud.
[00:49:29.739 --> 00:49:30.399]  In that county.
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.540]  Oh I know.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.421]  The oil and gas.
[00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:36.382]  Oil and gas just from family I know that works in the oil fields and things.
[00:49:36.803 --> 00:49:38.383]  It's so corrupt.
[00:49:38.804 --> 00:49:40.825]  And the scams and the things that are going on.
[00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:41.665]  That's what I mean.
[00:49:41.725 --> 00:49:46.948]  Corruption is just pandemic and the little people are being attacked and cheated in the process.
[00:49:47.868 --> 00:49:48.348]  God bless you.
[00:49:48.368 --> 00:49:49.028]  We're out of time.
[00:49:49.528 --> 00:49:52.409]  And I'm sorry to David and Amanda and others and Don.
[00:49:52.749 --> 00:49:53.670]  Call me back tomorrow.
[00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:54.670]  We'll be live tomorrow.
[00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:57.271]  I had all these notes and key issues I wanted to cover.
[00:49:57.311 --> 00:50:00.251]  Didn't get to it today, but I will tomorrow.
[00:50:00.891 --> 00:50:03.212]  All those notes I wrote, they're somewhere here in the crazy stack.
[00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:06.613]  But I appreciate everybody, all the AM and FM affiliates.
[00:50:06.633 --> 00:50:07.113]  Very thankful.

[00:50:10.614 --> 00:50:11.814]  Great way for folks to tune in.
