[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.451]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.852]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

[00:00:32.187 --> 00:00:37.109]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:00:40.014 --> 00:00:43.097]  You know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[00:00:43.217 --> 00:00:44.498]  The banks are crashing.
[00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.080]  The stock market's a mess.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.721]  There's the mortgage crisis.
[00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:49.643]  There's the lending crisis.
[00:00:49.803 --> 00:00:54.208]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.030]  And we are paralyzed a little bit.
[00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.831]  We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:58.792]  I don't know what to say.
[00:00:59.032 --> 00:00:59.593]  What can you do?
[00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:00.434]  Do what you can do.
[00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:01.034]  That's what you do.
[00:01:01.074 --> 00:01:01.995]  You do what you can do.
[00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:03.797]  What I can do is I can put some food away.
[00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.578]  Anyway, I know there's a global food shortage.
[00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:06.298]  I can read it.
[00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:09.319]  I can go to efoodsdirect.com, read hundreds of articles about this.
[00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:13.701]  I can go up on the Google website and Google food shortage and see the world's a mess.
[00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:14.201]  I know it.
[00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:14.642]  You know it.
[00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:15.442]  Look at the prices.
[00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:16.102]  Look where they're headed.
[00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:16.762]  Be prepared.
[00:01:16.802 --> 00:01:17.423]  Take care of yourself.
[00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:23.445]  You owe your family some security, some sense of self-being, a little bit of self-reliance is a good idea right now.

[00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.861]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.864]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.727]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:57.710]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:02:41.792 --> 00:02:51.539]  Had a video and coding issue at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.540]  The stream went down for a few minutes, but it's back up.
[00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:58.744]  A small part of what we do, but it's very important because it archives it for records.
[00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:04.488]  We will skip this next break for InfoWars.com audio listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:05.609]  Okay, Webster.
[00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:17.072]  Again, I was throwing my points in because I wanted to understand what you were saying and add some caveats to it, but go back and state that because I totally agree with you about what they're doing and what needs to be done.
[00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:22.756]  And the way you brought it into focus was just amazing that people think, oh, they're stopping the shorts.
[00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.657]  No, only on their own industry.
[00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:35.445]  These guys are complete pirates acting as if they know the ship's going down and they're just pulling out, you know, just every bobble and chandelier out of the mansion.
[00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:50.329]  It's the triumph of monetarism, saying that you can destroy industrial corporations that produce transportation, capital goods, machine tools, food, pharmaceuticals.
[00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.671]  Everything real is open season.
[00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:54.071]  All of them can be destroyed.
[00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:55.192]  Kill people and break things.
[00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:56.653]  It's military operations.
[00:03:57.273 --> 00:04:03.037]  The 799 parasitical banks, hedge funds, and remember this, according to some counts,
[00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:07.153]  Financial services represent one-third of the U.S.
[00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:09.055]  economy, which is monstrous.
[00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.056]  It's impossible.
[00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:11.097]  You can't have this.
[00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:18.863]  There's nothing left to eat, to wear, to live in, to drive, to fly in, to sail in, to use as a tool.
[00:04:18.923 --> 00:04:20.364]  Because there's all the debt they generate.
[00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:23.567]  Yeah, so they basically institutionalized that.
[00:04:23.687 --> 00:04:25.008]  Again, it's only for ten days.
[00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.292]  I would stress again, though, this is the fruit of deregulation.
[00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:31.834]  This is the fruit of the end of the Bretton Woods system.
[00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:44.733]  It's the fruit of lifting the bans on derivatives that were in place in many, many areas of the economy up until the mid-90s, up until Greenspan and the Clinton administration.
[00:04:44.814 --> 00:04:46.634]  Rubin, in particular, did this.
[00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:50.636]  You also got some things left over from the New Deal, like the Glass-Steagall Act.
[00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:53.697]  The Glass-Steagall Act was in force until November 1999.
[00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:55.777]  It said, you want to have a bank?
[00:04:55.938 --> 00:04:56.218]  Great.
[00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:57.098]  You want to have a
[00:04:57.594 --> 00:05:00.236]  Stockbroker, firm, stock jobbing operation.
[00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:01.136]  Gotta keep them separate.
[00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:01.276]  Great.
[00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:02.437]  They've gotta be separate.
[00:05:02.457 --> 00:05:05.739]  There's gotta be a complete firewall between them, separate corporations.
[00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:09.582]  Now you look at JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America, Wachovia.
[00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:15.566]  They are these hybrid monsters that are mainly, especially JPMorgan Chase, into derivatives.
[00:05:15.906 --> 00:05:19.528]  JPMorgan is about one-third of the derivatives in the world.
[00:05:19.608 --> 00:05:23.291]  It's something like 500 trillion, 600 trillion of derivatives.
[00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.033]  And then you've got this interesting uptick rule that they're all screaming about.
[00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:32.779]  Cox at the Securities and Exchange Commission, he surely is an incompetent and should be fired.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.261]  There's one point where McCain had something to say.
[00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:40.585]  Anyway, Cox should be fired because what he needs to do is to reinstitute the uptick rule.
[00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:44.509]  In other words, if you want to short a stock, you can't do it when it's only going down.
[00:05:44.549 --> 00:05:47.931]  You've got to wait until it starts to go up, and then you can short it.
[00:05:48.552 --> 00:05:50.794]  That would be more effective on the whole than this
[00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:51.756]  I think?
[00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:13.542]  Depending on the state, you pay 5, 6, 7, 8... But explain that!
[00:06:13.723 --> 00:06:17.224]  They are naked shorting with no money.
[00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:19.765]  They go in and manipulate things, putting nothing in.
[00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:20.686]  It's totally criminal.
[00:06:20.826 --> 00:06:26.869]  Yeah, and of course, they now mean... Goldman Sachs put out a bulletin saying it's time to short Citibank.
[00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:38.074]  So, Goldman Sachs, a bankrupt investment bank, says, let's survive ourselves by dragging down Citibank, which up until recently was the biggest commercial
[00:06:38.627 --> 00:06:39.608]  Bank in the U.S.
[00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:42.690]  Obviously, all of these institutions are no longer what they were.
[00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.451]  So they're even cannibalizing each other?
[00:06:44.851 --> 00:06:45.011]  Yeah.
[00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:49.554]  This is fratricide and cannibalization among the finance oligarchs.
[00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:58.019]  Now, I would say the hyperinflationary bailout that is now proposed, you can see that Paulson wants to ram that through within about a week.
[00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:01.341]  He's got this monster Pelosi on his side.
[00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:04.903]  He's got Dodd and Frank, but he's also got, I believe,
[00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:11.651]  Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell and Boehner, they're all going to go along with it.
[00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:17.852]  It's important for people in Congress to say, no, filibuster it, stop it, block it, and add killer amendments.
[00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:19.773]  The killer amendment would be something like this.
[00:07:20.493 --> 00:07:28.255]  Are you going to give a trillion dollars to these financial institutions and then let them come and foreclose on you anyway?
[00:07:29.013 --> 00:07:29.433]  Come on!
[00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:32.515]  If this is going to go through... Well, that's the point I keep making.
[00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:33.615]  It's so incredible.
[00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:36.897]  We bail them out, and then they take our houses.
[00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:39.418]  They're going to take your house away.
[00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:41.959]  And they've already been paid for it.
[00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:49.803]  They're going to have their hand in your pocket to pay for the bailout, and they're going to kick you out on the street because you were still under this...
[00:07:50.307 --> 00:07:51.087]  This foreclosure.
[00:07:51.107 --> 00:07:54.068]  So what an obvious killer amendment would be, you want to do this?
[00:07:54.108 --> 00:07:54.348]  Great.
[00:07:54.728 --> 00:07:58.610]  Stop all foreclosures for five years or for the duration of the crisis.
[00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.590]  Well Webster, that brings me to my next point.
[00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.311]  And we'll talk about this behind the scenes and come back and get into some larger questions with you.
[00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:04.852]  It's amazing.
[00:08:04.872 --> 00:08:06.132]  I've got to get you up next week.
[00:08:06.512 --> 00:08:07.172]  A lot sooner.
[00:08:07.192 --> 00:08:07.792]  Just amazing.
[00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:15.695]  The big issue here is Congress started speaking out against this last week and Paulson Sunday said sit down and shut up.
[00:08:16.687 --> 00:08:24.390]  The Treasury has contracts with these private banks and with these institutional investors and bond holders and so Congress is involved.
[00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.311]  Congress controls the purse springs.
[00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:27.812]  This is a constitutional crisis.
[00:08:29.112 --> 00:08:32.574]  So I'm going to skip that break for folks listening on Infowars.com.
[00:08:32.854 --> 00:08:34.554]  Webster, how should that be dealt with?
[00:08:34.575 --> 00:08:44.799]  I mean, we need to be calling Congress saying, hey, get up off your butts and tell them you're in the driver's seat because now we have this unitary executive, the Führerprecept, you know, with the bankers.
[00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:55.362]  Yeah, remember, Paulson is a member of the Principals Committee, and this is what runs the government.
[00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.865]  Bush and Cheney are simply figureheads.
[00:08:57.905 --> 00:08:59.747]  I don't even know what Bush thinks about this stuff.
[00:08:59.767 --> 00:09:01.669]  I don't think he understands it.
[00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:04.572]  Cheney is also in a haze of alcohol and
[00:09:07.344 --> 00:09:09.365]  And, you know, shooting at birds that he can't see.
[00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:14.969]  Well, he looks like he's about to die in a video I saw him in Georgia.
[00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.433]  Well, you know, let's let him drift off into the sunset.
[00:09:19.473 --> 00:09:22.875]  But in the meantime, we had two press conferences today.
[00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:24.876]  They weren't really press conferences, they were decrees.
[00:09:25.297 --> 00:09:34.203]  We had Paulson appearing with Cox and Bernanke, and he says, guess what, boys and girls, we're going to take one trillion dollars
[00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.812]  And prop up these toxic pieces of paper.
[00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:45.398]  We've got mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, and we want to have the government buy up the worst of them.
[00:09:45.498 --> 00:09:47.279]  What price is the government going to pay?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.723]  Recently, the last time I looked, the collateralized debt obligation is going to go for five cents on the dollar.
[00:09:53.104 --> 00:09:54.725]  What price is the government going to pay?
[00:09:54.745 --> 00:09:58.848]  Are they going to pay one dollar for each dollar of collateralized debt obligation?
[00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:02.991]  This stuff is crazy, but the interesting thing is, at the end of the press conference,
[00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:05.709]  Paulson takes three questions.
[00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:08.111]  You're trying to motivate the public.
[00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:11.954]  In other words, public support seems to be the last thing on the mind of Paulson.
[00:10:11.974 --> 00:10:19.880]  He took three questions at the end of this press appearance, this dictation that he was giving.
[00:10:20.616 --> 00:10:24.697]  He was asked, you know, what's the story with, you know, how much is it going to be?
[00:10:24.997 --> 00:10:26.418]  How long will it take?
[00:10:26.478 --> 00:10:27.678]  He wants it all done in a week.
[00:10:28.118 --> 00:10:39.341]  The Treasury is going to come up with a bill this weekend, and they're going to try to ram it through next week, because they all want to go home on September 26th to do their campaigning.
[00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:43.782]  So, again, I urge everybody, for whatever reason, you can have any reason at all,
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.221]  Stop this thing.
[00:10:45.521 --> 00:10:46.021]  Block it.
[00:10:46.361 --> 00:10:47.122]  Filibuster it.
[00:10:47.382 --> 00:10:53.867]  And again, I have these killer amendments that would have that effect and that would be reasonable and that would be educational.
[00:10:54.047 --> 00:10:57.950]  In other words, if you're going to do all this, why not stop foreclosures for five years?
[00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.833]  Why not wipe out those derivatives that have caused this crisis?
[00:11:02.273 --> 00:11:07.999]  Why not build in absolute guarantees for social security and the rest of the safety net?
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.201]  Why not add things?
[00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:09.741]  How about this?
[00:11:10.062 --> 00:11:14.947]  You're going to save Goldman Sachs from bankruptcy, and they're going to go back to speculating on oil.
[00:11:15.328 --> 00:11:16.649]  Oil is creeping up again, right?
[00:11:16.749 --> 00:11:18.491]  Oil is up $5 or $6 a barrel.
[00:11:18.772 --> 00:11:22.496]  We know that Goldman Sachs is about, well, it's about a third
[00:11:23.234 --> 00:11:25.515]  Okay, Webster, we're coming back to the full audience.
[00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:27.035]  Back it up again and recap.
[00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:27.295]  Here we go.
[00:11:48.632 --> 00:11:50.313]  Final segment with Webster Tarpeley.
[00:11:50.873 --> 00:11:55.176]  I want to set him up for a couple of hours next week to really break all this down.
[00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:57.898]  In fact, on air, Webster, I forgot to ask you because we skipped the breaks.
[00:11:58.905 --> 00:12:00.046]  We've got your book in front of you.
[00:12:01.488 --> 00:12:03.350]  Trey's out today because he's working this Sunday.
[00:12:04.771 --> 00:12:14.402]  But I hope there's some time we can get you on for a couple hours to really go through your ideas on reforming this crime syndicate for several hours.
[00:12:14.482 --> 00:12:17.065]  So let's confer on that and I'll call you after the show.
[00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:19.748]  But in the time we have left with you, Webster,
[00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:23.054]  Yes, I mean, you're absolutely right.
[00:12:23.294 --> 00:12:32.885]  They are imploding the economy, they're sucking it dry, and then they're still going to foreclose on our houses even though the tax burden to pay for the bailout is being put on our backs.
[00:12:33.526 --> 00:12:37.270]  I mean, this is just unbelievable, and they're turning the shorters
[00:12:42.188 --> 00:12:48.353]  Loose on what's left of the already beleaguered real economy, but protecting themselves.
[00:12:48.393 --> 00:12:51.215]  I mean, this is just, these wolves are not going to stop.
[00:12:52.096 --> 00:12:53.858]  So you had some ideas to try to stop this.
[00:12:54.298 --> 00:12:55.819]  Briefly get into those, we're almost out of time.
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:08.449]  And then, getting into the real world, I mean, we hope they listen to Webster Tarpley or others, Richard C. Cook, but we know they have a plan and that's move the military in and suck everything dry and implode the economy.
[00:13:09.315 --> 00:13:17.439]  You know, that's just basically the end of America and they move on to the happy hunting grounds and like to do in other third world countries and suck them dry and just put dictators in.
[00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:21.861]  You know, let's talk about where this is really going, though, because we all know they're not going to listen to us.
[00:13:22.482 --> 00:13:23.422]  So please continue.
[00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:27.404]  Well, let me just add one of the things we said during the break, which I think is important.
[00:13:28.045 --> 00:13:32.647]  You're going to be you're going to be bilked a trillion dollars to save Goldman Sachs.
[00:13:33.207 --> 00:13:36.729]  Goldman Sachs is still going to foreclose on your house.
[00:13:37.527 --> 00:13:57.252]  And, thanks to you, Goldman Sachs will still be around to jack up the price of oil through derivative speculation, that is to say, future indices, which are derivatives, in that offshore London deregulated market that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the two have been saved, are the biggest speculators.
[00:13:57.292 --> 00:14:04.194]  They're responsible for about 40% of the increase in the price of oil is due
[00:14:04.815 --> 00:14:08.096]  To the fact that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have bidded up.
[00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:12.817]  Now, as they were approaching bankruptcy, they were selling those futures contracts.
[00:14:12.877 --> 00:14:15.198]  That's why the oil price has gone down.
[00:14:15.218 --> 00:14:20.840]  Now that they're off the hook on bankruptcy, they're free to go back and speculate, and they're going to do that at your expense.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.701]  So this is absolute monstrous stuff that's going on.
[00:14:26.061 --> 00:14:31.543]  Again, I would call on people, mobilize, try to stop this bailout from going through, and again,
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.408]  Any argument you want to make against it is a good argument, but I think the most effective ones are, where is the public interest in all this?
[00:14:39.508 --> 00:14:42.992]  Where is the interest in rebuilding the United States?
[00:14:43.052 --> 00:14:48.058]  Everybody knows the infrastructure of the United States is at the point of physical breakdown.
[00:14:48.078 --> 00:14:51.302]  The interstate highway system is at the point of physical breakdown.
[00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:54.643]  The railroad infrastructure is collapsing, right?
[00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:56.345]  Train crashes all the time.
[00:14:56.385 --> 00:14:57.165]  Look at Los Angeles.
[00:14:57.185 --> 00:14:58.226]  But it's total greed!
[00:14:58.266 --> 00:15:05.892]  I mean, these brokers and these international bankers, they literally are making hundreds of... I mean, low-level guys in Wall Street are making 5-10 million a year.
[00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:08.774]  The big guys are getting, you know, 100 million dollar bonuses.
[00:15:09.115 --> 00:15:13.398]  They just don't care, and the public doesn't understand all this, so they have no idea!
[00:15:13.878 --> 00:15:18.162]  Well, the point of mass mobilization, I mean, obviously you reach it when
[00:15:19.028 --> 00:15:25.772]  The contraction, and we're now going into a violent contraction of production, employment, and living standards.
[00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:39.120]  When you get, instead of this gradual decline in the standard of living, when you get a sharp reduction of one-third to one-half of the current level, I think at that point, political mobilization becomes much more feasible.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.101]  The question is, you know, to do what?
[00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:43.242]  And again, I recommend
[00:15:44.076 --> 00:15:47.558]  Activist measures that will actually deal with the cause of the crisis.
[00:15:47.618 --> 00:15:53.122]  And again, the number one way to deal with the cause, wipe out derivatives.
[00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:56.444]  We've got between one and two quadrillion of these derivatives.
[00:15:56.484 --> 00:15:58.786]  There are now credit default swaps.
[00:15:58.846 --> 00:15:59.807]  We haven't talked about them.
[00:15:59.827 --> 00:16:01.208]  We've talked about the CDOs.
[00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:03.109]  Well, explain to people what a quadrillion is.
[00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:04.630]  I don't think they get their mind around it.
[00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.591]  It's a thousand trillion.
[00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:08.432]  You know, the whole U.S.
[00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:10.634]  budget is, what, three trillion?
[00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:11.805]  We're good to go.
[00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.293]  And if you say a quadrillion, that's probably ten times what the planet Earth is worth.
[00:16:30.353 --> 00:16:33.915]  Let's explain the level of this black hole of fraudulent debt they created.
[00:16:34.476 --> 00:16:35.656]  I mean, we don't know this, folks.
[00:16:35.717 --> 00:16:45.704]  It's just made up so these bastards can buy every shipping company, every coal mine, every local police department, and they just sit there with troops laughing, oiling their machine guns.
[00:16:46.244 --> 00:16:50.167]  I mean, now they're announcing they're going to occupy the U.S.
[00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:55.451]  with regular army, and it says in Army Times, we hope we don't have to shoot you.
[00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:58.052]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible!
[00:16:58.292 --> 00:17:07.538]  Let me add one other thing, though, because, let's just take the question of fascism, because one thing is to look only at the top-down stuff, the police state, dictatorship, totalitarian stuff.
[00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:09.719]  But now let's look at the fascist side.
[00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.620]  You see this thing with Governor Palin's email?
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.721]  This is really interesting.
[00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:19.264]  Bush and company were reading everybody's mail under the violation of the FISA Act, okay?
[00:17:19.764 --> 00:17:23.787]  But now you have hooligans, thugs, and
[00:17:24.963 --> 00:17:43.687]  The myrmidons of the Obama movement, neo-fascists, post-modern fascists, who go and read your email, and they do it with left cover, anti-establishment cover, radical cover, grassroots cover, and they're not the government anymore, but they're acting as a flanking operation to the government.
[00:17:43.707 --> 00:17:53.149]  In other words, Obama is on his way to seizing power, and he's got these fascist goons who are going to come and steal your email, and the public response is different.
[00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:54.029]  In other words, if Bush
[00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:58.983]  If Bush had been found reading somebody's email, that's a scandal for the left liberals.
[00:17:59.404 --> 00:17:59.785]  But now...
[00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:11.736]  When Gawker.com and the son of some Democratic Congressman, who's some kind of a goon for Obama, when they go and break into an email account, that's fine, because that has left cover.
[00:18:12.096 --> 00:18:22.086]  That's the genius of... I understand that, and you think Obama has the grassroots support to bring in something really dangerous, whereas McCain's a dead political duck, and we're just discredited, but here's the deal.
[00:18:22.506 --> 00:18:24.949]  Why don't we have the Rothschilds and the British Royalty
[00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:30.254]  And every other elite lining up on the surface, at least, for John McCain?
[00:18:31.014 --> 00:18:32.335]  Well, I don't see that at all.
[00:18:32.376 --> 00:18:32.996]  Oh, really?
[00:18:33.036 --> 00:18:34.217]  I can play you all the clips.
[00:18:34.658 --> 00:18:35.739]  But these are individuals.
[00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:36.800]  This is anecdotal stuff.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:44.147]  If you look at the massive evidence of who is giving the money, Obama is getting five times more out of Wall Street than McCain is.
[00:18:44.187 --> 00:18:49.071]  He's getting the most from Goldman Sachs, the most from Lehman, except for Hillary Clinton.
[00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:49.712]  That is true.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.060]  The money.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.624]  Look at the money, and you will see that Obama is the overwhelming candidate of Wall Street.
[00:18:56.644 --> 00:18:58.225]  Look at these people like Volcker.
[00:18:58.605 --> 00:19:00.626]  Look at the Federal Reserve.
[00:19:00.667 --> 00:19:06.070]  So you think they're going to try to use minorities as the Hitlerian brigade if he gets in?
[00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.653]  Because I do see them hiring the illegal aliens for the military and positioning them in key places.
[00:19:10.993 --> 00:19:11.914]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[00:19:11.934 --> 00:19:18.178]  You're saying he will, for the white bankers, kind of be the front of a brown revolution that's counter...
[00:19:18.778 --> 00:19:22.480]  I wouldn't see it in racial terms, although that's how Obama will try to package it.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:27.622]  The idea is that if you look at strike breaking, who has the credibility to break a strike?
[00:19:28.302 --> 00:19:29.243]  The Liberals!
[00:19:29.303 --> 00:19:30.704]  McCain's a reactionary.
[00:19:30.744 --> 00:19:31.564]  Nobody likes McCain.
[00:19:32.028 --> 00:19:33.449]  But Obama has left cover.
[00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:45.698]  Obama's gonna say, I'm breaking your strike for the polar bears, and for the poor people starving in Africa, and for the snail daughters, and all these other left-wing causes, which people are not, they're not prepared to fight back on.
[00:19:45.718 --> 00:19:50.361]  Well, Webster, I gotta get you back on next week, so look at your schedule and email Trey, or I'll call you.
[00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:51.442]  I want to get you on for two hours.
[00:19:51.882 --> 00:19:52.743]  Glad to do it, Alex.
[00:19:52.783 --> 00:19:53.404]  Thank you very much.
[00:19:56.906 --> 00:20:01.968]  The unauthorized biography at Amazon.com and Lulu.com until you stock it.
[00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:02.928]  That's right.
[00:20:02.948 --> 00:20:03.208]  Great.
[00:20:03.248 --> 00:20:04.249]  I'm glad for you.
[00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:05.109]  Yeah, new book out.
[00:20:05.649 --> 00:20:06.850]  Two books in just six months.
[00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.130]  That's incredible.
[00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.490]  Tarbley, good to hear from you.
[00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:10.411]  Thank you very much.
[00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:10.851]  Bye-bye.
[00:20:10.931 --> 00:20:12.071]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[00:20:12.632 --> 00:20:16.453]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm looking at the news on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:16.953 --> 00:20:18.914]  It's on the economy, on the police state.
[00:20:19.454 --> 00:20:21.135]  Just all the stops are being pulled out.
[00:20:21.175 --> 00:20:26.798]  This is the time to be paying attention to things, and this is the time to be spreading the word to everybody you know.
[00:20:26.818 --> 00:20:33.522]  You know, we keep telling you, get into gold, get into silver, get into storable food, get into water filters, get secure.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.841]  People say, what do I do?
[00:20:35.861 --> 00:20:36.281]  What do I do?
[00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:39.242]  You probably can't turn around going into a depression.
[00:20:39.282 --> 00:20:40.823]  You probably can't turn around the full looting.
[00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.405]  Or the third brigade of the army coming in.
[00:20:45.525 --> 00:20:48.787]  Or, I mean, they're openly announcing everything we told you.
[00:20:48.867 --> 00:20:50.148]  God knows what's going to happen now.
[00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:53.669]  I mean, they've told us it's horrible, but just to see it unfold is still another thing.
[00:20:53.709 --> 00:20:57.631]  It's one thing to analyze it, predict it, read their own documents where they say it.
[00:20:57.931 --> 00:20:59.532]  It's another thing to see it start unfolding.
[00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:12.325]  We just thank you all out there for your support of this radio show and our sponsors and everybody we bring on here, whether it's Ron Paul or Cindy Sheehan or Webster Tarpley, all the people we support and promote.
[00:21:12.565 --> 00:21:16.348]  We're a platform for everybody resisting tyranny to try to have a real debate about what's happening.
[00:21:16.628 --> 00:21:18.689]  For the balance of the show, the next 18 minutes,
[00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:31.453]  I am honored to be joined by Steve Shank to give us a perspective on what's happening as the oldest continually operating storable food company in the nation.
[00:21:31.773 --> 00:21:39.075]  Somebody who has a big factory, buys in bulk, can really give us a report on what the speculators are doing, what the famines worldwide.
[00:21:39.095 --> 00:21:39.815]  I've got reports.
[00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:50.157]  On that, French News Agency today, rising prices tip another 75 million towards starvation, and that's the UN's Food and Agriculture Organizations of the Day.
[00:21:53.571 --> 00:21:55.413]  850 million on the edge of starvation.
[00:21:55.453 --> 00:21:59.476]  This is up from only 200 million a few years ago to 925 million.
[00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:01.318]  This is being orchestrated.
[00:22:01.338 --> 00:22:12.807]  And look, all I know is, if there's a 10% chance of any of this happening here, with war or depression, folks, 80% of the country was agrarian on the farm in the Great Depression for 10 years.
[00:22:13.428 --> 00:22:15.069]  And you still had 7 million people starve to death.
[00:22:15.109 --> 00:22:16.630]  That's major university studies.
[00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.591]  Just Google.
[00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:19.072]  7 million starved during the Great Depression.
[00:22:19.092 --> 00:22:19.913]  That just came out a month ago.
[00:22:20.233 --> 00:22:20.834]  Big study.
[00:22:23.762 --> 00:22:24.543]  It's a historical study.
[00:22:24.563 --> 00:22:25.483]  You can go pull it up.
[00:22:27.104 --> 00:22:37.188]  My point here is, is that if we have a depression and the food stops showing up, it's already happening some places and stores are bare and a lot of staples are running out.
[00:22:37.248 --> 00:22:38.348]  I mean, it's bad, folks.
[00:22:38.868 --> 00:22:39.929]  It's really bad in the third world.
[00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:40.669]  They're starving to death.
[00:22:40.689 --> 00:22:42.670]  There's food riots everywhere, all over the world.
[00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.691]  Hundreds of countries are having problems.
[00:22:45.311 --> 00:23:05.806]  I hope none of this happens, but if we sail through this, and hey, there's no depression, and the bankers are sweet and pat us on the head, and the third brigade's sweet to us, and hands out donuts to kids, as they're going to do in PR stunts, they're admitting that, so my sarcasm has a basis in reality, then we're fine, and you just eat the food, and there's going to be bad inflation, that's already here, and so you save money that way.
[00:23:06.246 --> 00:23:08.107]  But I believe you should get his horrible foods.
[00:23:08.147 --> 00:23:08.847]  Now, I'm babbling.
[00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:11.229]  We're going to run out of time without even getting him up here.
[00:23:11.249 --> 00:23:12.870]  I wanted to get him on to talk about what's happening.
[00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.951]  Steve, stuff is going from bad to worse, isn't it?
[00:23:16.792 --> 00:23:17.932]  Well, absolutely.
[00:23:18.172 --> 00:23:26.137]  And, you know, we saw a couple of days ago the biggest jump in gold in the history of investment and things in this country.
[00:23:26.757 --> 00:23:34.181]  But the thing that people aren't seeing and that you and I have been talking about all the time, Alex, is the fact that
[00:23:34.736 --> 00:23:40.880]  If you think gold is hopping like crazy, you ought to see what the speculators are doing with food.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.003]  They have a sure bet the world is in famine.
[00:23:45.403 --> 00:23:55.750]  In the United States, we've got everybody running around, all the patriots and all the people that even are aware, running around saying, what can we do?
[00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.792]  The individual has to take control.
[00:23:59.172 --> 00:24:02.314]  We cannot wait for them to do whatever they're going to do.
[00:24:02.873 --> 00:24:06.475]  And the only way to do that is be completely independent.
[00:24:06.935 --> 00:24:09.336]  Now, the Victory Garden has to come back, guys.
[00:24:10.017 --> 00:24:18.601]  If people understood, Alex, exactly what's going on with food, we would not have one green lawn in this country.
[00:24:18.661 --> 00:24:23.523]  It would all be rototilled up, and people would be planting anything they can get for fall vegetables.
[00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:30.747]  Those that don't have the ability to plant would be putting in three to four years of food because
[00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:35.924]  Here's what happens if you have runaway inflation, and we have runaway inflation.
[00:24:35.964 --> 00:24:38.246]  We are going to have runaway inflation.
[00:24:39.366 --> 00:24:50.694]  The World War II Germany experience of taking your money to the store in wheelbarrows for a loaf of bread is in process right now.
[00:24:51.074 --> 00:24:58.339]  And what happens is you go through, first of all, the phase where you get out of the cash and into gold and silver.
[00:24:58.823 --> 00:25:08.567]  But then the next phase comes that the gold and silver will not buy what is not there, and what you have to do is take your value and roll it next into food.
[00:25:09.187 --> 00:25:19.891]  So anyone who understands what's going on must buy up ahead of time, while the money still has value, the food that they need.
[00:25:20.472 --> 00:25:22.613]  Now, you're going to have to compete right now.
[00:25:23.533 --> 00:25:28.395]  You and I talked about this several times in the last month and a half, Alex, but the fact is
[00:25:29.008 --> 00:25:46.701]  That our people are going to have to compete for their food right now against speculators who are seeing the most profitable bet in the history of mankind in investing in food commodities even better than the jumps that are taken in gold.
[00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:58.469]  There will come a time in the very short future where you will need to get out of your silver and gold, and the only thing that you'll be able to get into that will help any value or hold value
[00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:59.650]  It's good to go.
[00:26:12.645 --> 00:26:19.488]  The government takeover and the illegal use of public funds to bail out this insurance company.
[00:26:19.508 --> 00:26:20.608]  Folks, there's no doubt.
[00:26:20.628 --> 00:26:21.429]  Let me explain again.
[00:26:21.489 --> 00:26:24.250]  During the Depression, 7 million starved over that 10 years.
[00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.071]  I mean, that's a conservative number.
[00:26:26.431 --> 00:26:29.092]  And it wasn't that farmers, people say, well, how did that happen?
[00:26:29.472 --> 00:26:32.073]  A lot of farmers didn't really own their land, so they got kicked off.
[00:26:32.473 --> 00:26:33.914]  Then the food production went down.
[00:26:33.934 --> 00:26:35.835]  I mean, they kicked like half of Oklahoma out.
[00:26:36.155 --> 00:26:43.242]  You know, that's where Merle Haggard, you know, Yoki from Muskogee was really from Northern California because he was born in a railway car on the way there.
[00:26:44.483 --> 00:26:46.525]  I mean, and I'm not saying that's even going to happen.
[00:26:46.745 --> 00:26:49.488]  But folks, bottom line, stuff is getting crazy.
[00:26:50.209 --> 00:26:53.051]  And we just thank God the people out there like Steve Schenck
[00:26:53.632 --> 00:26:53.832]  It's 800-409-5633.
[00:27:14.144 --> 00:27:15.345]  We're good to go.
[00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:38.458]  Pay for, buy, and own in their possession the things that they're going to need.
[00:27:38.498 --> 00:27:41.001]  And the most important dependency that we have is food.
[00:27:41.342 --> 00:27:46.409]  I know I'm sounding like a one-trick pony, Alex, but the fact is that this is a fact.
[00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.335]  And people are going to have to start planning on victory gardens.
[00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:54.062]  Learning to grow sprouts, learning to do for themselves.
[00:27:54.102 --> 00:27:59.426]  Yeah, bottom line folks, the government is saying you owe hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[00:27:59.486 --> 00:28:04.450]  It's not true, it's a scam, and it's clear they're going to just rape everything.
[00:28:04.931 --> 00:28:16.961]  I mean, earlier, the reports of their turning the speculators loose on all the real industries, but guarding the parasites, and then the media advertises it as stopping speculators.
[00:28:17.201 --> 00:28:18.002]  It's the opposite.
[00:28:18.482 --> 00:28:22.529]  I mean, these guys are so criminal, it just blows my mind.
[00:28:22.569 --> 00:28:24.091]  Again, give that number out.
[00:28:24.973 --> 00:28:25.153]  It's 800-409-5633.
[00:28:29.884 --> 00:28:29.964]  800-409-5633.
[00:28:30.024 --> 00:28:42.815]  And for Prison Planet dot TV viewers right now, click on there Bob, and let's put, it's the top banner on InfoWars.com, let's go to eFoodsDirect.com for the TV viewers.
[00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:49.180]  In this fourth hour, Steve, we also do TV to thousands of folks watching, and then tens of thousands later that watch it as a rebroadcast at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:28:49.601 --> 00:28:51.943]  Now let's go ahead and put eFoodsDirect.com up there.
[00:28:52.924 --> 00:28:53.544]  I think so.
[00:29:14.565 --> 00:29:15.786]  Spread the word about those folks.
[00:29:15.806 --> 00:29:16.887]  They're very, very important.
[00:29:17.287 --> 00:29:18.548]  Support the local sponsors.
[00:29:19.169 --> 00:29:20.169]  Stuff is coming out of the wire.
[00:29:20.229 --> 00:29:21.050]  So hardcore.
[00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.131]  Gotta support every outlet we have and they are so precious.
[00:29:23.452 --> 00:29:25.153]  Spread the word about those AM and FM's we're on.
[00:29:25.493 --> 00:29:27.735]  And spread the word about InfoWars.com as well.
[00:29:27.775 --> 00:29:32.578]  Those are the exclusive streams only on InfoWars.com where you hear the behind the scenes.
[00:29:32.598 --> 00:29:34.520]  You're listening anywhere else, you're gonna be missing it.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.722]  Alright, Steve, we're gonna continue right now.
[00:29:39.163 --> 00:29:41.125]  Okay, Steve, continue please.
[00:29:42.233 --> 00:30:03.369]  The main thing that I've got to point out, Alex, is that the way that we deal as individuals and families with this uncertain and unfortunately too certain future that is being brought down around us is that we have to be independent so that we don't be beholden.
[00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:08.093]  You see, if you have your own bread, you never have to stand in a bread line.
[00:30:08.493 --> 00:30:10.895]  And historically, every single time
[00:30:11.516 --> 00:30:22.943]  That a government has taken over and taken away liberties and freedoms, the way that they control the people, the dissidents, or any of the people that want to fight, is by standing on bread lines, because there's no food.
[00:30:23.043 --> 00:30:24.644]  Food is the control mechanism.
[00:30:25.204 --> 00:30:35.431]  And if you take control of that dependency, then you have a chance to ignore what happens with whatever mechanism that they put into place.
[00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:38.953]  So, I know that it sounds like I'm talking food, food, food,
[00:30:39.386 --> 00:30:47.908]  You know, one of the things that I hear once in a while from critics of you and me talking about food all the time is, oh, they're just trying to huck this food.
[00:30:47.928 --> 00:30:50.448]  They're just trying to scare us to sell the food.
[00:30:50.828 --> 00:31:00.350]  Let me tell you, folks, every morsel of food that Alex can get his hands on, that we can get our hands on at J. Michael Stevens Group, will go to somebody.
[00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.031]  It'll be scarfed up and there won't be enough left.
[00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:06.880]  It's not a matter of selling anymore, it's a matter of saving lives.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.701]  Well, let's get down to brass tacks here.
[00:31:09.021 --> 00:31:11.142]  You're in a business you believe in up in Utah.
[00:31:11.522 --> 00:31:16.884]  I'm in a business I believe in in information in Austin, and I only have sponsors on that I endorse that I believe in.
[00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:21.866]  I've been telling you folks for years that we're going to do this to the economy.
[00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:31.930]  I told you three years ago they were going to start the controlled implosion in a film, in-game, and with all our guests, by imploding the economy, starting with the mortgages, the subprime.
[00:31:32.391 --> 00:31:32.851]  It happened.
[00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:33.651]  Okay.
[00:31:33.891 --> 00:31:35.972]  Now, I don't know if stuff's as bad as Steve's saying.
[00:31:36.072 --> 00:31:37.213]  I believe he believes that.
[00:31:37.313 --> 00:31:38.273]  I know he's in the business.
[00:31:38.553 --> 00:31:39.694]  I hope to God he's wrong.
[00:31:39.874 --> 00:31:42.195]  But every passing day, it looks like he's right.
[00:31:42.495 --> 00:31:46.377]  All I know is if there's a 10% chance of this happening, you've got to have storable food.
[00:31:46.757 --> 00:31:59.343]  And yeah, if it allows me to sponsor my radio show and pay my 14 employees and get a little bit of money to be able to operate and pay for the bandwidth of having some of the biggest websites on the web, absolutely, we need to operate.
[00:31:59.383 --> 00:32:00.563]  And I need food for my family.
[00:32:00.603 --> 00:32:01.944]  But everything I do is about
[00:32:02.464 --> 00:32:03.325]  Symbiotic.
[00:32:03.685 --> 00:32:06.308]  Everything I do is about win-win-win-win-win.
[00:32:06.348 --> 00:32:07.389]  I'm a win-win-win guy.
[00:32:07.589 --> 00:32:08.890]  I'm not a winner-loser guy.
[00:32:09.351 --> 00:32:10.832]  And so, we were right.
[00:32:10.872 --> 00:32:11.953]  You need to get storable food.
[00:32:12.033 --> 00:32:15.777]  Bottom line, J. Michael Stevens Group, eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:32:15.797 --> 00:32:17.939]  We'll put it back up on screen for everybody.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:26.023]  Steve, we're going to come back in the final segment to the full AM and FM audience, shortwave audience, but this is substantive also with just the internet.
[00:32:26.504 --> 00:32:39.550]  By skipping this break, I wanted to spend all that time we had, but let's come back and continue to talk about where you see the future of food prices going with inflation, right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network in association with Infowars.com.
[00:32:43.632 --> 00:32:47.173]  Okay, bottom line, you've been in the storable foods business for 27 years.
[00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.913]  Steve Shanks, our guest, Jay Michael, Steven Scribd, eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:32:52.933 --> 00:32:55.394]  It's where I've gotten my storable foods.
[00:32:55.414 --> 00:32:57.496]  High quality freeze dried and dehydrated.
[00:32:58.117 --> 00:32:59.618]  Really fits into small areas.
[00:32:59.938 --> 00:33:01.199]  The cans are jam packed.
[00:33:01.259 --> 00:33:02.480]  The boxes are jam packed.
[00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:05.662]  It lasts 15 something years in air conditioning.
[00:33:06.163 --> 00:33:08.284]  Guaranteed 10 in the garage, like at my house.
[00:33:08.304 --> 00:33:09.085]  I don't have room for it.
[00:33:11.627 --> 00:33:13.308]  I don't want to say how much food I've got.
[00:33:13.368 --> 00:33:15.130]  I've got a couple of years supply for my whole family.
[00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.071]  And I've even bought more and given it to family.
[00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:19.693]  And I keep forgetting for like months because I'm so busy, you're so busy.
[00:33:20.093 --> 00:33:22.995]  I want another year's supply.
[00:33:23.035 --> 00:33:24.937]  I need to call you and get that from you, Steve.
[00:33:24.957 --> 00:33:25.817]  I need to buy that from you.
[00:33:27.018 --> 00:33:30.220]  Because I'm realizing, my God, this isn't even enough what I have.
[00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:47.992]  Just in closing, seeing what's going on in the markets, you were right a year and a half ago, when we first started talking to you again, I've been listening to you for years, you obviously have a radio show here on Genesis, and let's plug that, but you were right about food prices going up then, and now it's continuing.
[00:33:48.392 --> 00:33:51.074]  I mean, how much are we going to see general food prices go up the next year?
[00:33:52.622 --> 00:33:57.704]  You will see them double and triple, and you will not see any food prices coming back down.
[00:33:57.864 --> 00:33:59.085]  It's not going to be like oil.
[00:33:59.665 --> 00:34:02.947]  There is a shortage, and it's worldwide.
[00:34:03.407 --> 00:34:04.807]  There is a serious famine.
[00:34:05.087 --> 00:34:09.169]  We're just clearing the third year of a worldwide famine.
[00:34:09.529 --> 00:34:13.031]  But the speculators have also piled on to the famine.
[00:34:13.771 --> 00:34:15.132]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:34:15.172 --> 00:34:22.235]  They're buying it up, and they're writing in financial magazines, they're bragging about the fact that they're buying up your food.
[00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:35.536]  The corn and the wheat and the soybeans and everything, they're buying up your food, and they're bragging that they expect it to double within the next three or four months, because foreign countries can afford to come in with cheap American dollars and buy your food.
[00:34:36.016 --> 00:34:46.301]  So, if these investors are investing in your food for the future, even if you don't have the funds to do it, find the resources and invest in your food.
[00:34:47.181 --> 00:34:59.428]  Well, I like that ad you run on the network, Steve, where the talk show host, nice fella, Roger Fredenberg, is talking about selling toys in his garage and getting horrible food.
[00:34:59.728 --> 00:35:06.552]  I mean, you know, this talk about, oh, I can't do it, is a bunch of malarkey for most people.
[00:35:07.452 --> 00:35:10.354]  And so, bottom line, folks, you need to give them a call.
[00:35:10.414 --> 00:35:11.374]  Give them the number again.
[00:35:11.394 --> 00:35:11.434]  800-409-5633.
[00:35:11.454 --> 00:35:11.494]  800-409-5633.
[00:35:16.687 --> 00:35:17.528]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:35:33.208 --> 00:35:41.731]  That people can thumb through and read and find out exactly what you're saying and what we're saying is the absolute truth and they've got to move.
[00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:52.095]  I mean, I just love getting people ready.
[00:35:52.195 --> 00:35:54.516]  I love getting people to not be dependent on Big Brother.
[00:35:54.536 --> 00:35:58.217]  It makes me feel so good, and I love pointing you at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:35:58.598 --> 00:36:04.960]  E-foods direct, just the letter E-foods direct dot com, big banners at the top of them, full wars dot com, and prisonplanet dot com.
[00:36:05.301 --> 00:36:06.361]  Steve, we'll talk to you soon.
[00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:07.261]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:36:08.142 --> 00:36:08.822]  Take care, Alex.
[00:36:09.402 --> 00:36:09.663]  You bet.
[00:36:09.763 --> 00:36:11.023]  Oh, and Steve, are you still there?
[00:36:11.683 --> 00:36:12.624]  Yeah.
[00:36:12.684 --> 00:36:16.946]  Are you going to have your ladies there answering the phones throughout the weekend?
[00:36:17.785 --> 00:36:18.486]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:36:18.806 --> 00:36:19.046]  24 hours.
[00:36:19.107 --> 00:36:20.128]  Oh, okay.
[00:36:20.308 --> 00:36:20.568]  24 hours.
[00:36:20.588 --> 00:36:21.129]  Thank you, Steve.
[00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.632]  Okay, there goes Steve Shank, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:26.114 --> 00:36:27.556]  Man, that is it for this radio show.
[00:36:27.776 --> 00:36:34.984]  I'm going to have Jim Mars on for an hour and 45 minutes of the Sunday show to really
[00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:41.896]  Do an in-depth presentation on the fascist Nazi system that's taking over.
[00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:43.558]  We don't mean the Nazis you think of, folks.
[00:36:43.598 --> 00:36:44.319]  It's more complex.
[00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:46.542]  You'll be in studio with me this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:36:46.582 --> 00:36:49.967]  Central, on the MN FM dial, Shrew Wave Satellite Internet out there.
[00:36:51.129 --> 00:36:54.353]  We had Jim Mars on for 30 minutes with a great overview on the economy.
[00:36:55.407 --> 00:37:02.591]  In the first hour today, I start the show with deep economic analysis and breakdown of what's really happening from the news.
[00:37:03.191 --> 00:37:07.034]  And then we had, of course, Richard C. Cook and Webster Tarpley on.
[00:37:07.054 --> 00:37:13.818]  And that all starts retransmitting until I'm back live Sunday at one place, the InfoWars.com exclusive streams.
[00:37:13.938 --> 00:37:14.898]  Those are the hot streams.
[00:37:15.178 --> 00:37:16.139]  God bless you all.
[00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:17.059]  Have a great weekend.
[00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:17.920]  Get out there and warn people.
