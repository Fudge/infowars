[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.691]  We've got a lot of stories we've covered, but then get into a bunch of other news that I haven't covered.
[00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:17.058]  I also want to show you, not just read it on air, but show you the lies of the Marine Corps and of the California Highway Patrol, where they admitted that the Marines were out running checkpoints.
[00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:27.504]  Then they lied and put out another press release saying they weren't doing it, and then they were caught by local news stations out there with the Marines searching and running checkpoints against the American people.
[00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:36.555]  This is a very big deal and we'll be going over those press releases and putting those up on screen later in the show for you.
[00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:43.284]  Also have a whole bunch of mainstream media reports about how the federal government, different psychiatry organizations,
[00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:43.884]  Thank you.
[00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:06.122]  Of the whole move towards a THX 1138 Brave New World where the public is all basically drugged at the hands of the government.
[00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:26.426]  We go back to the 2005 New Freedom Initiative that Congress passed and one of their board members leaked their internal documents out of Pennsylvania where they admitted this is about going from around 15% of the time of the school children on psychotropics or amphetamine type drugs, Ritalin, Prozac and those different families of psychotropics and stimulants
[00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:27.106]  Yes.
[00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:55.222]  of Masonic organizations and police organizations all over the country with what's called the CHIP program, getting children enrolled in databases, face scans.
[00:01:55.742 --> 00:02:02.444]  In places like Indiana, they're putting in face scanners that scan your whole head, thumb printing nationwide to get you into these databases.
[00:02:02.484 --> 00:02:06.605]  And I saw another report being done by the Masons in the Mason care facilities.
[00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:29.693]  Where they are doing a national pilot to test people's homes where cameras and surveillance systems watch you to make sure when you're elderly you're eating enough food that you're going to bed when you should so that I guess they know when to then come in and with eugenics I guess take you off to the euthanization center and we posted that up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:35.655]  So that is some of what we'll be covering here on the radio show today.
[00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:38.876]  Early in the hour so that I don't forget to go to your calls.
[00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:40.277]  I am going to open the phones up at 800-259-9231.
[00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:43.219]  Again that's 800-259-9231 and we will be taking some of your phone calls.
[00:02:54.853 --> 00:03:01.779]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, there are just scores of articles in the mainstream press, the Journal of Nature.
[00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.981]  In fact, I see you guys have it up on screen.
[00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.343]  See right there in the third paragraph where it has a blue link to nature?
[00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:09.645]  That's the story that I want.
[00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:14.269]  There in the paragraph where it says nature.
[00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.331]  See the, exactly.
[00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.292]  And then click on nature right there.
[00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:28.457]  And you will be able to actually go to the Journal of Nature telling everybody that we need to all basically be on drugs.
[00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:29.578]  But that's coming up later.
[00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:33.399]  The coverage on the Marines is coming up later.
[00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.022]  A few seconds ago you saw us also put on screen again one of the press releases from CHIPS.
[00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:42.098]  uh... dealing with the marines u.s.
[00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:57.614]  marine corps on the streets of america in that case it is california so please stay with us we'll be back after this quick break and continue with your phone calls and the news we are live here at prison planet dot tv please stay with us
[00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:09.120]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.422]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:15.943]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:04:16.223 --> 00:04:24.386]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:30.349]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.290]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.531]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:38.913]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:04:39.073 --> 00:04:41.174]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:04:41.294 --> 00:04:49.057]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:55.677]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:57.458]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:17.358]  But who is the enemy?
[00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:18.359]  Bin Laden.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.620]  This is his M.O.
[00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:20.962]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:22.644]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:29.771]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:30.612]  Some U.S.
[00:05:30.652 --> 00:05:36.338]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:40.481]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:50.747]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:51.728]  Fabled enemies.

[00:06:06.923 --> 00:06:08.424]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:10.045]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:06:10.345 --> 00:06:12.586]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:06:13.026 --> 00:06:17.768]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.010]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.

[00:07:06.877 --> 00:07:11.942]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:12.302 --> 00:07:14.584]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:07:31.436 --> 00:07:33.657]  Alright, let's continue with your phone calls.
[00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:38.621]  Before I do that, I want to finish up with the last caller.
[00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:41.062]  We had to cut short Paul from Germany.
[00:07:41.743 --> 00:07:51.730]  He called in last week and brought up to me about the military on the streets of America and he hadn't heard about that while he's in the army in Germany.
[00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:59.363]  And then today he called back and he said he read the Army Times and didn't see anything about civil unrest.
[00:07:59.463 --> 00:08:13.172]  Well, the Army Times article that we covered and the Washington Post and every other publication, Secretary of Defense Gates' directive he put out on the 24th of November to the armed services said for civil unrest.
[00:08:14.153 --> 00:08:14.473]  Okay?
[00:08:14.913 --> 00:08:21.658]  And so right now, for everybody at PrisonPlanet.tv, I am just going to go to the wicked Google
[00:08:22.557 --> 00:08:24.258]  Because it is still the best out there.
[00:08:24.858 --> 00:08:27.060]  And I'm going to type in Washington Post.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.841]  Washington Post.
[00:08:30.922 --> 00:08:35.365]  And then I'm going to put in after that Northcom.
[00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:36.065]  That should bring it up.
[00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:39.467]  Okay.
[00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:41.168]  I'll just do this myself here on air.
[00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:45.771]  And when you go to that, you click on News.
[00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:49.393]  And I typed in Northcom.
[00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:50.114]  Let me type in
[00:08:53.578 --> 00:08:55.941]  Let me type in civil unrest.
[00:09:00.247 --> 00:09:04.353]  I guess I could just cancel the show and do this, because that's what I'm going to have to start doing, is to get this stuff for people.
[00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:09.620]  And here you have it.
[00:09:11.598 --> 00:09:21.445]  The Reading Eagle out of PA reporting on it and it says for 20,000 uniformed troops for civil unrest and crowd control.
[00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.666]  Op-Ed News has a link to it.
[00:09:24.027 --> 00:09:26.849]  So I'm just going to sit here until I find this and I'm going to show everybody this.
[00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.191]  And I'll assure you there's Marines running checkpoints as well.
[00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:32.592]  There's just unbelievable denial.
[00:09:33.464 --> 00:09:34.044]  going on.
[00:09:35.025 --> 00:09:36.306]  Well, here is the Army Times.
[00:09:36.346 --> 00:09:42.429]  Let's just click on the Army Times, and maybe they've edited this and changed it, but I know I had my people save it because I'm making a film.
[00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.633]  Brigade Homeland starts tour October 1st, 3rd Infantry, 1st BCT.
[00:09:49.033 --> 00:09:52.635]  Trains for new dwell time mission, helping people at home.
[00:09:52.655 --> 00:09:54.697]  They become a permanent part of active duty.
[00:09:56.698 --> 00:10:00.320]  And let me read this to people.
[00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:08.610]  And I'll just have to read that during the break, because I'm going to not be able to read the whole thing here on air.
[00:10:10.091 --> 00:10:11.051]  And there's a correction here.
[00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:21.739]  It says, the non-lethal crowd control package fielded in the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, described in the original version of the story, is intended for use of deployments to war zones not in the U.S.
[00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:22.699]  as previously stated.
[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:29.304]  So I guess they have actually edited this article, because previously it said for civil unrest,
[00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:30.124]  I think?
[00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:51.516]  in the Washington Post article that was there for everybody.
[00:10:52.136 --> 00:11:05.484]  So what I'm going to do is, I'll try during the breaks myself, to put together an article package for everybody where they do admit this and I'll try to pull up the Secretary of Defense Gates document.
[00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:10.908]  In fact, let's just go ahead and do this now and I'm going to do it again at the end of the show because we have a guest coming back on the show.
[00:11:12.219 --> 00:11:25.346]  The Marines announced last week that they were going to be through the 12th through the end of this month into the new year running checkpoints in one particular county with the Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol.
[00:11:25.986 --> 00:11:28.267]  And on screen there's two of these.
[00:11:28.848 --> 00:11:30.429]  The first one is the unamended copy.
[00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:31.329]  This is what they sent out.
[00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:36.312]  Then we called the Marines, we called others, and they said, yes, it's true, we're going to be out there doing it.
[00:11:36.972 --> 00:11:44.878]  Then, when the local media got upset about it, they put out the amended copy, which is the second one we're going to put up on screen for you.
[00:11:44.918 --> 00:11:45.619]  We have that.
[00:11:46.199 --> 00:11:49.662]  And there is the amended copy for everybody.
[00:11:51.062 --> 00:12:01.232]  And then they lied and said they weren't going to be out there, and then local news stations did report, and we have those reports up on Infowars.com, they did report that the Marines indeed were out there.
[00:12:01.813 --> 00:12:07.618]  In fact, let's go ahead and play that clip, John, from the local news talk station, whose news director we also interviewed.
[00:12:08.359 --> 00:12:11.322]  This report ran a few days ago.
[00:12:11.682 --> 00:12:14.245]  For those that are still denying all of this is going on, here it is.
[00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:22.334]  The local California Highway Patrol Station held a highly questionable DUI license checkpoint Friday night.
[00:12:23.034 --> 00:12:27.216]  When they announced the checkpoint, they said they'd be doing it along with military police.
[00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:36.060]  Z1077 ran an editorial reminding the CHP about federal laws prohibiting the military from enforcing civilian laws.
[00:12:36.852 --> 00:12:44.175]  At about 11.30 Friday morning, we received a fax from the local CHP office announcing the action would not include military police.
[00:12:44.776 --> 00:12:53.539]  Also, by law, to avoid entrapment, the CHP is required to provide the location of the checkpoint to the media at least two hours prior.
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:03.944]  They did provide Z1077 with a phone number to call at 7pm to get the location, but, defense lawyers take note, no one ever answered the phone.
[00:13:04.676 --> 00:13:16.910]  To add insult to injury, when the CHP held the checkpoint in front of the Home Depot in Yucca Valley, they did indeed include marked military police cars, as well as uniformed military police.
[00:13:19.266 --> 00:13:20.548]  All right, so there you have it.
[00:13:20.648 --> 00:13:28.057]  And then if you look at, just Google non-lethal weapons, here's the Army admitting they want to use C-130 gunships against the American people.
[00:13:28.838 --> 00:13:36.086]  Non-lethal weaponry applications to AC-130 gunships in actions other than war, and they admit they plan to use this.
[00:13:37.088 --> 00:13:38.490]  for the American people.
[00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.897]  And this is what's approved for public release for everybody.
[00:13:42.917 --> 00:13:49.668]  So it's time for all of the denial to end on these subjects.
[00:13:51.215 --> 00:14:03.741]  The Marines also are building a new camp complete with a sports stadium inside 29 Palms, the same place back in the 90s where they had the questionnaire, will you fire on U.S.
[00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:04.202]  citizens?
[00:14:04.562 --> 00:14:06.002]  Will you confiscate their guns?
[00:14:06.903 --> 00:14:11.765]  And that's where they're running around the countryside, they're off base at checkpoints with the state police.
[00:14:12.386 --> 00:14:16.628]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead now and go back to your calls.
[00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:23.288]  And getting up my call list here, taking some getting used to here in the new studio.
[00:14:23.908 --> 00:14:27.389]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mohan in the United Kingdom.
[00:14:28.309 --> 00:14:29.669]  Mohan, you're on the air.
[00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:30.230]  Welcome.
[00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:31.290]  Hello.
[00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.050]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.991]  I just want to say I appreciate all the work you're doing.
[00:14:34.011 --> 00:14:36.231]  I've been into this stuff for about 13 years.
[00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:40.833]  And I wanted to ask you about the financial meltdown.
[00:14:41.033 --> 00:14:42.093]  I'm very concerned about
[00:14:42.557 --> 00:14:43.758]  Practical things I can do.
[00:14:43.778 --> 00:14:47.340]  I mean, they've been saying up until a month ago that there is no financial meltdown.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.923]  Like there's no Marines on the streets and there's no announcement that they're going to be used for civil insurrection.
[00:14:52.804 --> 00:14:54.825]  So, I mean, just say there's no economic meltdown.
[00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:55.726]  There's no new world order.
[00:14:55.746 --> 00:14:56.326]  It doesn't matter.
[00:14:56.727 --> 00:15:00.509]  The Financial Times of London announces that they're running everything and that it's world government.
[00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.910]  Just say it doesn't exist.
[00:15:02.591 --> 00:15:03.451]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:04.772]  It's crazy, I know.
[00:15:05.653 --> 00:15:10.216]  And, you know, I wanted to ask you about your advice, really, and what your opinion is about
[00:15:10.703 --> 00:15:17.039]  I mean, do you see it as being a serious financial meltdown, even worse than the Great Depression?
[00:15:19.704 --> 00:15:22.706]  Well, number one, it isn't even a financial meltdown.
[00:15:22.766 --> 00:15:26.329]  It is an orchestrated implosion of the economy by cutting off the liquidity.
[00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:34.575]  And it will be as bad as the social engineers think they can make it before we effectively throw off their bondage.
[00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:37.137]  And so that's why they're threatening us with the military now.
[00:15:37.177 --> 00:15:43.381]  That's why they're threatening the use of the military against the American people, is to try to scare us into going along with all this.
[00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:45.423]  And the same thing, as you know, is happening in Europe.
[00:15:45.803 --> 00:15:45.903]  Right.
[00:15:45.923 --> 00:15:46.023]  Right.
[00:15:46.043 --> 00:15:46.123]  Okay.
[00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:19.013]  So I mean, do you foresee serious riots?
[00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:22.940]  What worries me is that in the UK the population density is so high.
[00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.252]  I mean, a friend of mine reckons there's going to be serious blood on the streets and, you know, a lot of people killed.
[00:16:27.692 --> 00:16:28.232]  Well, it is.
[00:16:28.272 --> 00:16:34.835]  The population density wouldn't be high if people weren't herded into the cities and the Queen and her minions didn't own most of the property.
[00:16:35.215 --> 00:16:43.039]  Pull up that Gerald Cilente article from PrisonPlanet.com where he was predicting the riots for folks.
[00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:46.901]  Again, we've been predicting this as well, Greece-style riots.
[00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:51.802]  Coming to the United States, that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:52.222 --> 00:17:04.706]  Frequently and frighteningly accurate trends forecaster Gerald Cilenti says the America will see riots similar to those currently ongoing in Greece and that will be caused by hyperinflationary depression.
[00:17:05.726 --> 00:17:08.150]  And it goes on from that point.
[00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:15.821]  We're being told the riots are happening because the police shot a child, but that was only really the flashpoint there.
[00:17:15.861 --> 00:17:19.426]  But again, if you read the IMF and World Bank documents that were released at the end of 2001,
[00:17:21.343 --> 00:17:22.823]  They're in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:34.227]  They state that they create the economic collapse to then cause the rioting and then once, because the social engineers know within three to four days you get rioting with no food.
[00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:37.508]  That's what's happened in Greece in many areas, no jobs, no food.
[00:17:37.908 --> 00:17:45.151]  Then that gives them the excuse to, well then that makes the stock markets plunge even further, that makes society and all hope be lost.
[00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:50.873]  Then things fall apart so the establishment has the pretext to really come in with total control.
[00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:55.634]  And then the middle class begs them to come in for control just to stop the rioting and looting.
[00:17:55.654 --> 00:17:56.114]  You understand?
[00:17:56.135 --> 00:17:56.875]  Right.
[00:17:57.275 --> 00:17:57.515]  Yeah.
[00:17:57.775 --> 00:17:58.375]  Yeah.
[00:17:59.196 --> 00:17:59.436]  Yeah.
[00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:07.358]  I mean, like a friend of mine, you know, has been talking about, you know, it might be a time, at the time, maybe a year's time or so to get out the country.
[00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:12.360]  You know, I mean, he doesn't know that much about the conspiracy stuff, but he's talking about
[00:18:13.075 --> 00:18:15.376]  Well, where are you going to go?
[00:18:15.396 --> 00:18:16.656]  I mean, where are you going to go?
[00:18:16.676 --> 00:18:24.658]  This is going to be a worldwide depression, a worldwide control grid, openly, as the Financial Times of London said, to bring in a world government.
[00:18:25.298 --> 00:18:27.059]  They are bringing in world government right now.
[00:18:27.079 --> 00:18:32.800]  I mean, they killed hundreds of millions last century funding the Nazis and the Communists, the same banker families, publicly.
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.581]  I mean, so the sky's the limit.
[00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:38.402]  They must be defeated, they must be exposed, and they're openly stealing
[00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:44.653]  8.5 trillion in the US, trillions in Europe, close to a trillion in England.
[00:18:44.953 --> 00:18:53.598]  I mean, they are the criminals, they are the Ponzi scheme operators, but they're such big powerful Ponzi scheme scam artists that they own the military and the government fraudulently.
[00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:56.339]  So, either they go or we go.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.641]  Either they get their world government system of tyranny or we defeat them.
[00:18:59.981 --> 00:19:00.922]  I appreciate your call.
[00:19:00.942 --> 00:19:03.603]  We'll come back, take more calls, cover a lot of other news.
[00:19:03.924 --> 00:19:04.384]  Stay with me.
[00:19:07.276 --> 00:19:08.817]  The holiday season is here again!
[00:19:08.837 --> 00:19:12.499]  A time to appreciate our friends and family and the many blessings we have.
[00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:15.461]  It's also time to find unique gift ideas for those we love.
[00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:18.763]  This year, why not give a gift that saves your loved ones money?
[00:19:19.003 --> 00:19:23.586]  A two-ounce bottle of fuel conditioner from Fuel Saver Technologies makes a great stocking stuffer.
[00:19:23.846 --> 00:19:25.907]  It's also an inexpensive and thoughtful present.
[00:19:26.127 --> 00:19:32.170]  A small squeeze of our product in the gas tank improves combustion, boosting fuel economy 10 to 20% or more.
[00:19:32.411 --> 00:19:39.955]  Completely safe for all engines, our fuel additive also reduces emissions, maintenance costs, and reduces the friction of engine moving parts.
[00:19:40.315 --> 00:19:44.257]  Each little bottle treats 100 gallons of gasoline or 50 gallons of diesel.
[00:19:44.397 --> 00:19:48.380]  With a case of 16 or 32 bottles, you'll have plenty to give as gifts!
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.783]  And the cost is only $6 per bottle, with free shipping!
[00:19:52.023 --> 00:19:55.926]  Call us toll-free, 866-768-7811.
[00:19:56.146 --> 00:19:59.669]  Or go online at fuelsaverinc.com.
[00:19:59.809 --> 00:20:03.032]  That's 866-768-7811.
[00:20:03.272 --> 00:20:05.634]  A unique gift that saves everyone money!
[00:20:07.155 --> 00:20:12.600]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.121]  And we knew what to do.
[00:20:14.906 --> 00:20:15.947]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:20:16.167 --> 00:20:22.595]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:20:23.216 --> 00:20:31.726]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:20:32.113 --> 00:20:38.919]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:42.262]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:20:42.382 --> 00:20:47.626]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:20:48.167 --> 00:20:50.789]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:20:51.229 --> 00:20:57.975]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD
[00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:02.156]  I suppose the government sponsored terror.
[00:21:02.597 --> 00:21:05.198]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:21:06.418 --> 00:21:06.758]  Good day.
[00:21:06.918 --> 00:21:08.379]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:08.899]  December 16, 2008.
[00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:10.079]  Gold opened this morning at $835.80.
[00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:13.380]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $860.68, $430.34 for the half ounce, and $215.17 for a quarter ounce.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:13.641]  That's $860.68, $430.34, and $215.17.
[00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:36.677]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[00:21:36.797 --> 00:21:39.879]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[00:21:39.979 --> 00:21:43.241]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[00:21:43.321 --> 00:21:46.143]  However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[00:21:46.403 --> 00:21:49.145]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[00:21:49.205 --> 00:21:51.927]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.107 --> 00:21:54.269]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:57.071]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:57.311 --> 00:22:01.014]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.034 --> 00:22:01.214]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:06.738 --> 00:22:10.000]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.243]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:22:14.423 --> 00:22:25.850]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:31.914]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:22:32.154 --> 00:22:32.775]  We're good to go.
[00:22:55.037 --> 00:22:55.378]  We're good.
[00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:13.570]  Okay, we're live.
[00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:21.040]  During that little four-minute break, I was trying to Google around for CBS News, Washington Post.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.547]  I know we screenshot and saved the Army Times, where it said, we hope we don't have to shoot Americans.
[00:23:27.047 --> 00:23:29.831]  That's what we're deploying for, and that's Ian Gates' own report.
[00:23:31.639 --> 00:23:38.523]  And then I said, you know, I'll just go to PrisonPlanet.com and find the articles that Paul Watson and Steve Watson wrote about this a month ago.
[00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:46.808]  And so I went to PrisonPlanet.com and guess what today's afternoon top headline, because they write multiple stories a day.
[00:23:46.828 --> 00:23:47.568]  They're great guys.
[00:23:48.128 --> 00:23:50.930]  It is a story we've got up on screen for you right now.
[00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:58.754]  And it says, Army Strategic Shock Report says troops may be needed to quell U.S.
[00:23:58.794 --> 00:23:59.535]  civil unrest.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:12.464]  Purposeful domestic resistance would require military to rapidly determine the parameters defining the legitimate use of military force inside the United States and that is against the American people.
[00:24:12.904 --> 00:24:15.825]  I'm reading directly from the Army Strategic Report.
[00:24:15.845 --> 00:24:16.805]  I mean there's hundreds of these.
[00:24:17.145 --> 00:24:23.768]  I mean just today I'm talking about it and people are calling in who can't find it and it's just everywhere.
[00:24:23.808 --> 00:24:29.610]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to set Paul Watson up on the show tomorrow or I can just do this tonight and I'm going to find
[00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:38.993]  Ten reports, and a couple of Army reports where they're saying it, and I'll blow it up and show it to you on screen so there's no more denial about all of this.
[00:24:39.013 --> 00:24:42.074]  Strategic Studies Institute, United States Army War College.
[00:24:42.134 --> 00:24:42.874]  Okay, do you see that?
[00:24:43.914 --> 00:24:44.414]  Punch me up.
[00:24:44.514 --> 00:24:45.235]  Okay, you see this?
[00:24:45.275 --> 00:24:47.695]  I'm on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:24:48.015 --> 00:24:55.358]  The date is the 16th of December 2008, and you can go there and you see the official Army War College Strategic
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:18.056]  uh... development and it says right here use troops against the american people and what are the rules of engagement against the american people now gates on the november twenty fourth put out another report saying it's for civil unrest and riding in the united states that's what the army time said there was a huge backlash to it and that was two months ago and they announced uh... you know a brigade close to five thousand
[00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.934]  Now they've announced 20,000 trips for Homeland Security to fight terror, environmental reasons.
[00:25:25.194 --> 00:25:26.796]  Barack Obama put out a new order.
[00:25:26.816 --> 00:25:28.857]  In fact, I've got it right here in my stack.
[00:25:29.878 --> 00:25:30.378]  Here it is.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.543]  WorldNetDaily and Infowars.com.
[00:25:35.663 --> 00:25:36.623]  And what is our source?
[00:25:36.744 --> 00:25:41.027]  We link directly through to Obama's new National Security Directive.
[00:25:41.047 --> 00:25:43.249]  I mean, here they are, right here.
[00:25:44.622 --> 00:25:48.084]  Here they are, right here for you, and you can read where he's saying that.
[00:25:48.365 --> 00:25:49.125]  Here are the headlines.
[00:25:49.205 --> 00:25:51.567]  New rules for Obama's National Security Force.
[00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:52.747]  It doesn't just say policing.
[00:25:53.068 --> 00:25:54.449]  It doesn't just say law enforcement.
[00:25:54.809 --> 00:26:03.695]  It says, for all community reasons, which is what Gates mentions in his report and what the Army Times says about using troops, quote, at auto accidents.
[00:26:04.255 --> 00:26:08.338]  And then we have the Marines out at checkpoints in California for U.S.
[00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:09.800]  citizens, and we put that on screen.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.483]  I mean, I don't know how much more we've got to show people before they figure it out.
[00:26:14.523 --> 00:26:15.904]  But put it back up on the screen.
[00:26:16.145 --> 00:26:18.406]  This is the Army War College, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:18.907 --> 00:26:19.968]  The Army War College.
[00:26:20.488 --> 00:26:23.951]  And listen, people may seem like I'm really in a bad mood or upset.
[00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:29.616]  I'm upset because, I mean, I've been videotaping the Marines trying to confiscate our guns for a decade.
[00:26:30.316 --> 00:26:36.391]  Now that army walk up to me on the streets of Texas in Belton south of Waco and say turn your cameras off.
[00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.232]  You know, that's in road to tyranny when they're out there.
[00:26:40.072 --> 00:26:42.094]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[00:26:42.194 --> 00:26:48.659]  I mean, this is going on all around us and we have to address it and deal with it so that we can politically say no to it.
[00:26:49.319 --> 00:26:58.286]  Instead, we have been so culturally taught that this doesn't exist, as it was creeping up, as the alternative media warned you, that people are now saying, well, no, the media denies it.
[00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:01.028]  They are not denying that this is going on.
[00:27:01.508 --> 00:27:04.591]  So I need everybody to go, right now, to
[00:27:06.332 --> 00:27:12.075]  PrisonPlanet.com and get this report that's up on screen and get it out to everybody that we know out there.
[00:27:14.116 --> 00:27:17.377]  In fact, John, just go ahead and dial Paul Watson for me right now on air.
[00:27:17.417 --> 00:27:31.343]  Go ahead and dial him in England because I can't do this by myself in here while they're busy running the show and Aaron's busy packing up the studio over there today so he would normally be here to pull stuff up while I'm live on air.
[00:27:33.044 --> 00:27:40.065]  I want to get Paul on and by the end of the show I want him to come on and he can read five or six headlines and give people where it says civil unrest.
[00:27:40.306 --> 00:27:42.006]  I mean, I just gave you another one.
[00:27:42.526 --> 00:27:47.387]  I just gave you the Army's website saying it on screen for you.
[00:27:49.888 --> 00:27:50.528]  Punch it back up.
[00:27:50.708 --> 00:27:51.588]  They'll say it's not real.
[00:27:52.848 --> 00:27:55.149]  And, you know, there it is, folks.
[00:27:55.989 --> 00:27:56.329]  Okay?
[00:27:57.549 --> 00:28:01.310]  And it says right here in it, in the 51 page report,
[00:28:04.457 --> 00:28:07.018]  That they are going to use these against the American people.
[00:28:08.078 --> 00:28:12.859]  I mean, there it is, and there's the article that boils down all the key points of it with links.
[00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:25.202]  Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities and extremes to defend basic domestic order and human security.
[00:28:25.262 --> 00:28:27.162]  The report, authored by retired Lt.
[00:28:27.202 --> 00:28:27.522]  Col.
[00:28:27.642 --> 00:28:29.003]  Nathan Fryer, reads,
[00:28:31.815 --> 00:28:48.962]  Employment of weapons of mass destruction or other catastrophic capabilities, unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, catastrophic natural and human disasters, are all passed through the disruptive domestic shock.
[00:28:49.442 --> 00:28:54.505]  But what this guy doesn't know, writing this, I'm sure he's not evil, is that this was all engineered and orchestrated.
[00:28:54.525 --> 00:28:56.405]  It's just incredible.
[00:28:57.046 --> 00:28:57.946]  We're on the march.
[00:28:58.446 --> 00:28:59.947]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.670]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:07.046 --> 00:29:12.629]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:27.017]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[00:29:27.237 --> 00:29:30.478]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:35.261]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:37.403]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[00:29:37.623 --> 00:29:40.886]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[00:29:41.206 --> 00:29:47.812]  Ozone therapy is used among other things to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[00:29:48.012 --> 00:29:51.956]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators
[00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:56.880]  By going to ioniczone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:02.625]  That's I-O-N-I-C, zone, dot com, or toll free, 800-549-9535.
[00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:04.326]  Ionic Zone.
[00:30:04.406 --> 00:30:13.334]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:30:13.714 --> 00:30:15.376]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:30:16.368 --> 00:30:17.389]  But who is the enemy?
[00:30:17.889 --> 00:30:18.410]  Bin Laden.
[00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.671]  This is his M.O.
[00:30:19.691 --> 00:30:20.992]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:30:21.052 --> 00:30:22.693]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:30:23.053 --> 00:30:29.819]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:30.659]  Some U.S.
[00:30:30.679 --> 00:30:36.364]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:30:37.044 --> 00:30:40.486]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:42.527]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:31:06.812 --> 00:31:12.457]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:31:12.657 --> 00:31:17.822]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:31:18.082 --> 00:31:23.166]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:27.030]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.031]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:32.092]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[00:31:32.292 --> 00:31:35.354]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:31:35.594 --> 00:31:39.115]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:31:39.375 --> 00:31:43.917]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:31:44.197 --> 00:31:44.978]  Do your part.
[00:31:45.238 --> 00:31:47.499]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[00:31:47.859 --> 00:31:56.683]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[00:31:57.063 --> 00:32:03.248]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:04.950]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:32:24.884 --> 00:32:26.665]  Alright, we're back live ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:29.566 --> 00:32:31.587]  Here at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:34.348]  We're streaming live over the internet.
[00:32:34.548 --> 00:32:41.251]  I'm going to go to your phone calls and I'm going to go through a news blitz here.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.381]  I mean, I could talk all day just about this article out of nature.
[00:32:45.981 --> 00:32:48.903]  There's a bunch of other stories where they say we all need to be put on drugs, basically.
[00:32:48.943 --> 00:32:51.584]  That Ritalin and Prozac and other things are brain boosters.
[00:32:52.004 --> 00:32:55.326]  They're saying they want to put statin drugs in all the water to force us to take it.
[00:32:55.346 --> 00:32:59.067]  There's open discussions of putting Prozac in the water, just like they had fluoride.
[00:32:59.487 --> 00:33:01.168]  I mean, this is just total insanity.
[00:33:01.768 --> 00:33:04.409]  And then people will just deny that they're even saying all of this.
[00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:08.131]  I mean, you cannot make this type of stuff up.
[00:33:09.492 --> 00:33:10.132]  It's just, it's...
[00:33:11.644 --> 00:33:13.004]  All of it is just too amazing.
[00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:15.845]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Ohio.
[00:33:15.885 --> 00:33:17.225]  Mike, thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:18.486]  Hello.
[00:33:19.006 --> 00:33:20.366]  Yes, sir.
[00:33:21.006 --> 00:33:31.889]  Alex, I've been sitting here and listening to you with my two questions in mind, and you completely blew my mind when you said that you're preparing to use Puff the Magic Dragon.
[00:33:33.988 --> 00:33:46.710]  Yeah, they're going to mount a C-130 that's normally mounted with the Vulcan gatling guns and howitzers with microwave guns and sound cannons to fly around and hurt the American people.
[00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:49.671]  They've been drilling for decades to make war on us.
[00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:58.012]  And I've seen Puff the Magic Dragon work out in Vietnam and they can put a bullet in every square inch of a football field.
[00:33:59.253 --> 00:33:59.573]  It's robotic.
[00:33:59.593 --> 00:34:01.193]  Why would they need something like that here?
[00:34:02.697 --> 00:34:09.678]  Because the bankers are going to totally bankrupt everything and take this nation over, and if the public doesn't like it, they're going to use the military on us.
[00:34:09.918 --> 00:34:15.560]  It's the bankers imploding the economy, then it falls apart, then the people riot, then they bring in the military against us.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.620]  As we've always said, it's now happening.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:28.382]  Yeah, well I know I've been following things, but I never thought I'd ever see the day that we'd be using the Marine Corps in the United States of America.
[00:34:28.622 --> 00:34:32.403]  In fact, when I was stationed in California at the Marine Corps Air
[00:34:33.411 --> 00:34:38.716]  Uh, we weren't even allowed to wear our jungle boots or utility boots off base.
[00:34:40.177 --> 00:34:44.941]  If you left base, you either wore your civilian clothes or you wore your full-dress uniform.
[00:34:44.981 --> 00:34:47.263]  There was none of those utilities off the base.
[00:34:47.779 --> 00:34:53.527]  That's because in a free society, you don't have military on the streets running around controlling the population.
[00:34:53.567 --> 00:34:55.329]  But in a police state, you do.
[00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:56.891]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[00:34:56.911 --> 00:34:57.872]  I appreciate your call.
[00:34:57.912 --> 00:34:59.254]  Here's a story out of CNN.
[00:34:59.294 --> 00:35:00.516]  I see these stories every week.
[00:35:00.956 --> 00:35:04.861]  Slain student called 911, but no one came in time.
[00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:11.013]  And then 48 minutes later the police did show up and she'd been brutally murdered.
[00:35:11.053 --> 00:35:19.537]  Then the police basically for a few days tried to cover up the fact that they got a 9-1-1 call and that this person came in and killed her and they never came for 48 minutes.
[00:35:19.997 --> 00:35:21.378]  I'm not even here bashing the police.
[00:35:21.418 --> 00:35:23.859]  The police can't protect you historically.
[00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:25.099]  It's not their job.
[00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:26.120]  The Supreme Court's ruled.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.921]  But I do bash the system and the police for trying to confiscate our guns.
[00:35:30.282 --> 00:35:32.242]  How dare you try to disarm us?
[00:35:32.262 --> 00:35:35.344]  How dare this article not say women ought to arm themselves?
[00:35:36.064 --> 00:35:45.212]  I mean, every day I read about some woman jogging or going to her car, or somebody busting in their house, and these women light them up with a little .357 in their purse.
[00:35:46.753 --> 00:35:55.600]  You need to take your daughters out, teach them how to shoot, you need to train them, and they need to get firearms, and when somebody tries to come in and rape them and kill them, they need to kill them.
[00:35:56.481 --> 00:35:57.101]  Bottom line.
[00:35:57.942 --> 00:35:58.642]  Here's a story.
[00:35:59.944 --> 00:36:05.252]  out of my record journal and it says Big Brother is watching but seniors don't mind.
[00:36:05.292 --> 00:36:14.786]  I'm gonna get this group or this senior on the show and it says seniors keep track of just about everything Shirley Player does in her apartment.
[00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:20.536]  So sensors keep track of just about everything Shirley Player does in her apartment.
[00:36:20.897 --> 00:36:25.080]  But she's not worried that Big Brother is watching far from it.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.362]  Then it says everything she eats is monitored by a computer.
[00:36:28.642 --> 00:36:30.564]  There's sensors in every room watching her.
[00:36:31.064 --> 00:36:32.746]  They're making sure she gets enough rest.
[00:36:32.766 --> 00:36:34.207]  They're making sure she gets her food.
[00:36:34.607 --> 00:36:36.528]  She's 80 something years old, 84 years old.
[00:36:39.284 --> 00:36:46.430]  This is a test put on by the Masons, and they're the same ones making sure all the kids get in the databases.
[00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.832]  And you can go read this crazy article.
[00:36:48.852 --> 00:36:53.195]  This is just incredible.
[00:36:57.579 --> 00:37:01.983]  And she's doing this as part of a study with the Masonic Healthcare Center Independent Living Complex.
[00:37:04.315 --> 00:37:20.281]  and uh... this is in her separate apartment and everything she's doing being watched toyota's gonna put sensors in all your cars watching you with an infrared camera and the minute the temperature goes up too high in the car the sensor will dial a cell phone that's in the car to police that will then over a cell phone link watch you
[00:37:21.541 --> 00:37:28.423]  The chief of police in San Antonio, excuse me, in Houston last year proposed cameras in everyone's homes watching them.
[00:37:29.183 --> 00:37:31.184]  They're putting cameras in young people's cars.
[00:37:31.204 --> 00:37:35.225]  They're moving to try to make it the law that new drivers have to have a camera in the car watching them.
[00:37:35.425 --> 00:37:37.905]  There's always these excuses for it about how it's for safety.
[00:37:38.186 --> 00:37:39.726]  This is all about control.
[00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.110]  In fact, I forgot to give you this article, guys.
[00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.891]  Will you guys take these two articles and just put them up on screen?
[00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:50.992]  I know I won't be covering them at the time, but I want to get them up on screen so folks see them.
[00:37:51.012 --> 00:37:54.252]  Because what happens is folks out on the web watching this are lazy.
[00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:56.073]  They'll just say I made it up.
[00:37:56.093 --> 00:37:57.373]  They'll just say it doesn't exist.
[00:37:58.253 --> 00:37:59.353]  This is Time Magazine.
[00:37:59.373 --> 00:38:01.574]  Could Greece's riots spread to France?
[00:38:02.154 --> 00:38:03.314]  How about the United States?
[00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:05.534]  Desperate doublespeak.
[00:38:05.574 --> 00:38:08.255]  Global cooling is part of global warming.
[00:38:10.216 --> 00:38:15.240]  Before I take some more calls, go ahead and get the fellow on who we had to cut off because of another guest.
[00:38:16.181 --> 00:38:29.351]  Go ahead and get Ben on, who goes under the pen name Branson Hunter, who wrote the original great story about the Marines running the checkpoints that was then confirmed by the mainstream media, the checkpoints against the American people.
[00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:36.176]  He wanted to get more into the sports stadium FEMA camp that they built there and finish up with that.
[00:38:36.216 --> 00:38:38.597]  So I want to have him on to cover that as well.
[00:38:39.578 --> 00:38:40.539]  Thank you for the call, Mike.
[00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:42.260]  Let's talk to Todd in Texas.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.600]  Todd, you're on the air.
[00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:49.143]  Hey Alex, I sent an email out to Mr. Gideon Rackman and he sent me a response.
[00:38:49.683 --> 00:38:51.064]  I'd like to read you what I got here.
[00:38:51.204 --> 00:38:53.345]  Now remember, everybody isn't inside your head.
[00:38:53.425 --> 00:38:55.026]  They don't know who Gideon Rackman is.
[00:38:55.526 --> 00:39:08.933]  Preface it, it's the Financial Times of London last Tuesday, and now for a world government headline, admitting it's tyrannical, saying that that's a good thing, that democracy's bad, and that the bankers are going to take over and set up a world government.
[00:39:09.659 --> 00:39:12.000]  Well, I wanted to hear how the email ended.
[00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:40.080]  His line got cuts.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.602]  Call back in right now.
[00:39:43.682 --> 00:39:44.482]  Mike in Ohio.
[00:39:44.522 --> 00:39:45.503]  Leave a line open for him.
[00:39:46.103 --> 00:39:47.624]  Don't let that line fill up, John, okay?
[00:39:48.405 --> 00:39:49.765]  I want to hear the end of that email.
[00:39:49.805 --> 00:39:50.966]  I want to hear how he responded.
[00:39:51.286 --> 00:39:53.728]  Send your email to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:54.928 --> 00:39:55.549]  That was interesting.
[00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:57.230]  I want to hear how that guy responded.
[00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.112]  Let's go ahead and talk to Todd in Texas.
[00:40:01.192 --> 00:40:02.013]  Todd, you're on the air.
[00:40:04.194 --> 00:40:04.914]  Or that was Todd.
[00:40:05.335 --> 00:40:06.495]  Charles in California.
[00:40:06.535 --> 00:40:07.296]  Go ahead, Charles.
[00:40:08.442 --> 00:40:10.702]  Hi, Alex.
[00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:13.303]  You're Al Qaeda, though, is the problem with your show, you know?
[00:40:14.503 --> 00:40:17.304]  I think you're supporting terrorists right now with what you're doing.
[00:40:17.504 --> 00:40:18.044]  That's right.
[00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:23.165]  I have FEMA on video teaching police that the Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[00:40:23.205 --> 00:40:23.665]  I'm agreeing.
[00:40:23.685 --> 00:40:24.585]  We're all now terrorists.
[00:40:25.365 --> 00:40:30.166]  I mean, yeah, I think you're going to cause us to lose the war on terror, though, you know, specifically.
[00:40:30.206 --> 00:40:37.928]  And I don't know if you're going to... I think everybody's teeth are going to fall out from, you know, getting Ecolo Blue machines and not using the industrial waste, you know?
[00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:42.351]  Yeah, you gotta drink your industrial waste fluoride or with alcohol.
[00:40:43.271 --> 00:41:03.195]  Yup, but um, I was wondering if you knew, uh, basically how the whole, uh, the vaccine and the, the chips are all linked, and, uh, Obama also invested in, uh, what's it called, AVI Biopharma, which made, uh, which made a vaccine cure for avian flu or whatever?
[00:41:03.215 --> 00:41:03.775]  Mm-hmm.
[00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:06.876]  You know about that?
[00:41:09.144 --> 00:41:10.344]  Yeah, so that's good to know.
[00:41:10.404 --> 00:41:14.486]  Now that you've got the chips, supposedly the chips can tell if you have a virus.
[00:41:15.566 --> 00:41:22.488]  And, uh, you know, because if you're thinking about this stuff logically, it's hard to, you know, hard to imagine that they're going to chip people.
[00:41:22.508 --> 00:41:30.551]  It's hard to imagine all this stuff, but when you know, you know, cause I thought it was, that was, I thought that was the least likely scenario to happen is if a flu release.
[00:41:31.257 --> 00:41:31.737]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:31.757 --> 00:41:33.319]  But now I think it's the most likely.
[00:41:53.831 --> 00:42:03.054]  Well, I want to hear... I know he sent a bunch of nasty emails out and wrote a nasty article about all of us emailing him, calling us basically slime, but I'd like to hear what he had to say.
[00:42:03.814 --> 00:42:05.695]  Let's talk to Clint in Texas.
[00:42:05.735 --> 00:42:06.535]  Clint, you're on the air.
[00:42:06.555 --> 00:42:15.218]  I'm wondering, Alex, if they had ever found that nuclear warhead
[00:42:15.902 --> 00:42:22.732]  That appeared to have been lost from Minot Air Base on the way to Barksdale down there in New Orleans.
[00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.175]  Well it was... Near New Orleans.
[00:42:24.355 --> 00:42:25.857]  First it was... Did they find that nuke?
[00:42:26.278 --> 00:42:27.520]  Do you want me to answer the question?
[00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:28.641]  Yes.
[00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:36.713]  First it was three, then it was six, and then they said they were misaccounted for, which is basically impossible to happen.
[00:42:37.113 --> 00:42:38.634]  And then, yes, they had never lost them.
[00:42:38.654 --> 00:42:47.118]  They had only lost them for a few days when they were secretly flying them down from Minot down to Louisiana.
[00:42:47.558 --> 00:42:57.483]  And so that was clearly some weird clandestine operation where the military was trying to steal the warheads for six cruise missiles themselves.
[00:42:58.143 --> 00:43:01.386]  And so it was only lost for a day or so.
[00:43:02.727 --> 00:43:03.127]  Oh, okay.
[00:43:03.568 --> 00:43:04.549]  But it was never lost.
[00:43:04.569 --> 00:43:06.330]  They were trying to bait and switch it.
[00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.652]  And then somebody in the chain of command blew the whistle.
[00:43:09.093 --> 00:43:10.954]  And then they murdered a bunch of people involved with it.
[00:43:10.974 --> 00:43:14.317]  A bunch of people involved flying the nukes out mysteriously died.
[00:43:16.179 --> 00:43:16.519]  Oh, my.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:17.300]  Mm-hmm.
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.742]  We have very, very sick people in control.
[00:43:21.203 --> 00:43:21.403]  Yep.
[00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:23.145]  They all stooped to no level, Will.
[00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:26.232]  There's no level low enough that they won't stoop to.
[00:43:26.352 --> 00:43:27.193]  They're going for broke.
[00:43:27.213 --> 00:43:28.774]  They're stealing all the pension funds.
[00:43:29.054 --> 00:43:34.238]  They know the public's going to rebel against them, and when they do, they're going to use that as a pretext to turn the military loose on us.
[00:43:34.659 --> 00:43:37.301]  This is just ungodly what we're headed into.
[00:43:37.361 --> 00:43:37.861]  God bless you.
[00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:38.762]  I appreciate your call.
[00:43:39.002 --> 00:43:49.950]  We're going to go back to calls, but I wanted to bring him back up for just three or four more minutes to finish up, because he was trying to recap and tell the stories of one of the local news reporters who had been
[00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:58.252]  reporting on the Marines running the checkpoints in San Bernardino County.
[00:43:58.512 --> 00:44:06.255]  And that's now confirmed by local news stations and we've talked to the Marines and CHIPS and here is the press release from CHIPS admitting Marines.
[00:44:06.315 --> 00:44:07.535]  I'm putting it on screen.
[00:44:07.916 --> 00:44:08.456]  It's real.
[00:44:08.536 --> 00:44:12.457]  I've shot video of this at other events and people tell me it's fake Marines.
[00:44:12.737 --> 00:44:13.898]  They tell me it isn't real.
[00:44:15.298 --> 00:44:16.519]  Let's keep that up there on screen.
[00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:21.041]  Other points you wanted to add about this giant training center they've built
[00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:24.459]  Put up the first one for folks, please.
[00:44:25.939 --> 00:44:26.660]  That's the one, yes.
[00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:32.944]  Okay, I want to go back to Ben who writes for the Cactus Thorn blog, who's one of the first to be reporting on this.
[00:44:33.244 --> 00:44:37.706]  Finish up your point about the sports stadium, little FEMA center they've built, sir.
[00:44:39.527 --> 00:44:40.148]  Okay, Alex.
[00:44:40.288 --> 00:44:44.390]  Well, I think I mentioned that it's nearly the size of San Diego.
[00:44:46.405 --> 00:44:48.706]  Phase 1 will be 600 buildings.
[00:44:49.026 --> 00:44:56.349]  This is from the Pentagon, and I sent you an email with the local newspaper write-up on it.
[00:44:57.169 --> 00:45:06.113]  Phase 2 will be 746 buildings, and those types of facilities are called pronounced K-mount.
[00:45:08.494 --> 00:45:10.995]  This is by Camp Wilson.
[00:45:11.437 --> 00:45:16.260]  Which is ten miles north of the main base.
[00:45:17.421 --> 00:45:22.284]  They claim that it's mount training, but again KBR has built these FEMA camps.
[00:45:22.644 --> 00:45:25.906]  It's clearly a dual-use facility for the American people.
[00:45:26.967 --> 00:45:31.129]  Why do they need a full-size Olympic stadium for training?
[00:45:31.149 --> 00:45:32.010]  That's a lot of money.
[00:45:33.174 --> 00:45:36.416]  Well, the sky's the limit when enslaving the American people.
[00:45:36.636 --> 00:45:43.660]  I mean, I've got video of the Marines trying to take our guns, and the public watches it and can't believe it, so they say it's not real Marines.
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:50.563]  And it's doubtful some of this money is coming from the Navy, because the Marine Corps is under the Navy.
[00:45:51.143 --> 00:45:56.206]  It's coming from, no doubt, the Pentagon, as well as this expansion.
[00:45:57.147 --> 00:46:01.589]  And just recently, on national
[00:46:02.356 --> 00:46:07.979]  Online newspapers, the Pentagon has lost like billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[00:46:08.039 --> 00:46:09.240]  They cannot account for it.
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:15.263]  Well, it's stashed away somewhere, you know, for an ulterior purpose.
[00:46:16.283 --> 00:46:29.170]  And if I could just go back to their, their, the Marine Corps is training off base in residential areas in the Wonder Valley area, which, which butts right up next to the
[00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:38.695]  The southern portion of the Marine base, helicopters have been using people's homes as training areas.
[00:46:39.076 --> 00:46:42.738]  Low-flying helicopters buzzing around people's homes.
[00:46:43.739 --> 00:46:46.701]  Not once, not twice, but apparently they keep doing it.
[00:46:47.201 --> 00:46:54.125]  The woman that brought this to the attention in a letter to the editor, she called the base and she complained.
[00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:55.666]  They questioned her patronism.
[00:46:58.496 --> 00:47:03.659]  Well, I'm putting video on screen of Police State 2000 and here are the hovercraft landing and I have video of the Coronado battleship.
[00:47:03.679 --> 00:47:05.601]  Now understand, when I put this out in 1999,
[00:47:18.425 --> 00:47:30.281]  I mean, major news articles said that these are not real Marines they're saying, these are not real hovercraft, these are not real ships, because they couldn't deal with it.
[00:47:30.701 --> 00:47:33.545]  The video is of Marines training with role players.
[00:47:34.306 --> 00:47:39.730]  Who are playing the part of the American people, and the police work with them, with Chinooks.
[00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.872]  Now people claim I hired these Chinooks.
[00:47:42.452 --> 00:47:43.393]  And this has been claimed!
[00:47:43.773 --> 00:47:46.956]  And they go into the comments, and it's always military people, and they're running a psy-op.
[00:47:47.296 --> 00:47:49.458]  They know the public's weak-minded, so they just lie to them.
[00:47:50.555 --> 00:47:51.876]  I'm putting the police SWAT teams here.
[00:48:06.363 --> 00:48:08.226]  Now again, people claim this is all Hollywood.
[00:48:08.246 --> 00:48:09.367]  They claim this is all fake!
[00:48:09.767 --> 00:48:11.309]  Doesn't matter, it's all happening!
[00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.372]  And I got video of them trying to take your guns!
[00:48:13.412 --> 00:48:14.413]  This isn't real.
[00:48:15.114 --> 00:48:16.035]  I hired all of this.
[00:48:16.836 --> 00:48:18.018]  I hired that hovercraft.
[00:48:18.538 --> 00:48:20.901]  I hired these police lining up to work with them.
[00:48:21.262 --> 00:48:23.344]  I hired all these warrior fighting vehicles.
[00:48:25.146 --> 00:48:29.109]  Rolling out that folks are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv on the streams right now.
[00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:34.753]  And I hired just supposedly all these people and their evidence is the role players.
[00:48:34.994 --> 00:48:39.037]  See, you know the public's weak minded and very dumbed down and really brain damaged.
[00:48:39.577 --> 00:48:40.858]  And this is still photos I took.
[00:48:41.219 --> 00:48:43.000]  And so they go, well wait a minute, you say there's actors.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.984]  Yes, the Marines hired actors to play the part of Americans going to FEMA camps.
[00:48:48.484 --> 00:48:48.805]  Put it up.
[00:48:49.045 --> 00:48:51.166]  Here they are taking us to the FEMA camps.
[00:48:51.186 --> 00:48:52.588]  This is how the Marines were dressed up.
[00:48:53.462 --> 00:48:56.804]  These guys have been training to take your guns, to take everything.
[00:48:57.425 --> 00:49:00.046]  There they are with the mock police working with real police.
[00:49:00.467 --> 00:49:03.329]  Here they are practicing invading California.
[00:49:04.509 --> 00:49:05.130]  Here are the troops.
[00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.151]  I mean, here it all is.
[00:49:09.973 --> 00:49:10.373]  Look at that.
[00:49:10.533 --> 00:49:12.895]  There they are practicing slamming Americans to the ground.
[00:49:14.516 --> 00:49:18.038]  Okay, so I just can't deal with this anymore, the denials.
[00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:19.659]  Anything else, sir?
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:21.981]  Well, yeah.
[00:49:23.728 --> 00:49:27.165]  Would you like to just talk briefly about the expansion?
[00:49:28.084 --> 00:49:34.890]  The Marine Corps' expansion, making... Look, what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to set you up as an official guest, and I appreciate you being on.
[00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.912]  Can you come on the show tomorrow, officially, for like 30 minutes?
[00:49:37.612 --> 00:49:37.973]  Uh, sure.
[00:49:37.993 --> 00:49:38.673]  Alright, we'll do that.
[00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:39.074]  Take care.
[00:49:39.094 --> 00:49:46.320]  I want to come back with Paul Watson, because I got him to go find a bunch of mainstream news articles where they say civil unrest riots.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:49.443]  I mean, I just put up the Army's official War College on it.
[00:49:49.463 --> 00:49:53.306]  There's a story on PrisonPlanet.com, but you're in denial?
[00:49:53.346 --> 00:49:55.308]  We'll even give you more out there.
[00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.672]  And I get upset by this.
[00:49:57.712 --> 00:49:59.334]  This upsets me when I'm covering this.
[00:49:59.354 --> 00:50:01.437]  This upsets me when I'm covering this.
[00:50:01.457 --> 00:50:04.340]  This is hard to deal with for me, for my family.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.942]  I know what this means historically.
[00:50:07.148 --> 00:50:10.790]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:16.454]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:50:16.594 --> 00:50:20.636]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[00:50:20.936 --> 00:50:23.217]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[00:50:23.378 --> 00:50:29.221]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures.

[00:51:20.446 --> 00:51:27.209]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:31.130]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:34.711]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:34.911 --> 00:51:36.632]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:36.672 --> 00:51:42.433]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:51:56.817 --> 00:52:02.982]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:52:03.002 --> 00:52:06.465]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.

[00:52:38.642 --> 00:52:44.704]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:17.592]  I kind of blew up earlier in the hour because I'm a real guy.
[00:53:17.632 --> 00:53:18.772]  This is real information.
[00:53:19.333 --> 00:53:24.075]  The caller calls in and says, I can't find it in the Army Times about civil insurrection.
[00:53:24.556 --> 00:53:26.777]  Now the Army Times did cut a bunch out of their article.
[00:53:27.097 --> 00:53:30.319]  We've now discovered that and they admit it's a correction at the bottom.
[00:53:30.619 --> 00:53:34.982]  But they did not remove, and here's the article.
[00:53:36.235 --> 00:53:36.716]  You see that?
[00:53:37.276 --> 00:53:40.680]  This was just printed literally hot off the presses five minutes ago.
[00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:42.722]  When I got this off the printer it was hot.
[00:53:43.143 --> 00:53:44.564]  ArmyTimes.com.
[00:53:44.584 --> 00:53:45.065]  You see that?
[00:53:45.565 --> 00:53:47.668]  Brigade Homeland Tour starts October 1st.
[00:53:47.848 --> 00:53:52.133]  Right here it says, for civil insurrection against the American people.
[00:53:52.513 --> 00:53:54.916]  Now you can go read that for yourself all day long.
[00:53:55.964 --> 00:53:57.285]  Let me give you the paragraph number.
[00:53:57.305 --> 00:53:57.285]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[00:53:59.827 --> 00:54:03.289]  It's the twelfth paragraph.
[00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:04.470]  Twelfth paragraph.
[00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:05.771]  Now, I've got Paul Watson on.
[00:54:05.811 --> 00:54:08.173]  He dug up some more articles where they say it's for civil insurrection.
[00:54:08.853 --> 00:54:13.497]  Paul Watson and Steve Watson just posted a big article where the Army's openly saying it.
[00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:15.378]  How do they engage the American people?
[00:54:15.398 --> 00:54:16.339]  You know, they're preparing.
[00:54:16.359 --> 00:54:17.740]  Now, they're acting like this is all new.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.401]  This is not new.
[00:54:18.741 --> 00:54:21.303]  But finishing up with Todd in Texas who got cut off.
[00:54:21.843 --> 00:54:29.725]  He sent an email exposing and confronting the Financial Times of London writer calling for world government.
[00:54:30.085 --> 00:54:32.265]  Briefly, just give me his answer, because I want to go to Paul Watson.
[00:54:32.285 --> 00:54:33.085]  I've got to finish up with him.
[00:54:35.326 --> 00:54:36.346]  Go ahead, Todd.
[00:54:38.046 --> 00:54:40.127]  Yes, his answer was a simple no.
[00:54:40.147 --> 00:54:41.427]  So he crawled back in the shadows.
[00:54:41.447 --> 00:54:43.127]  He didn't think I could put three senses together.
[00:54:43.147 --> 00:54:44.008]  Anybody else could do it.
[00:54:44.608 --> 00:54:46.028]  So these people, they have no spine.
[00:54:46.068 --> 00:54:48.109]  So, you know, there you have it.
[00:54:48.129 --> 00:54:50.009]  He just sent me a simple no.
[00:54:50.029 --> 00:54:50.369]  That was it.
[00:54:50.931 --> 00:54:55.457]  So I mean, you write him a thing saying we're aware of your new rule or we're not going along with it and he just says no?
[00:54:56.792 --> 00:55:01.293]  Yeah, I told him at the end, I said, uh, climb out of the reptile house and get in the ring, accept the invitation.
[00:55:01.313 --> 00:55:02.614]  The Alex Jones Show extended to you.
[00:55:02.834 --> 00:55:04.674]  You stuck your neck out on this one, be a man about it.
[00:55:05.154 --> 00:55:06.335]  No, he sent me on his Blackberry.
[00:55:06.935 --> 00:55:08.676]  Alright, good job.
[00:55:08.856 --> 00:55:09.616]  Listen, I gotta jump.
[00:55:09.656 --> 00:55:10.576]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:10.636 --> 00:55:12.497]  This is a great first official TV show.
[00:55:12.517 --> 00:55:15.478]  We're gonna have some two, three hour shows this week with guests in studio.
[00:55:15.498 --> 00:55:16.698]  I want to thank the crew.
[00:55:16.758 --> 00:55:23.220]  Doing something new like this is very stressful, especially for me in here in the catbird seat, but I want to commend the whole team in there.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:34.072]  I want to commend Hip Hop Hartman and I want to commend Paul Hartman, I want to commend Dan and everybody else, Aaron and the rest of the crew.
[00:55:34.672 --> 00:55:40.138]  Alright, Paul Watson, you know my pet peeve, nothing gets me more crazy.
[00:55:41.175 --> 00:55:42.556]  Yeah, the new article is about
[00:56:06.255 --> 00:56:13.723]  It's a US Army War College report called Known Unknowns Unconventional Strategic Shocks in Defence Strategy Development.
[00:56:14.724 --> 00:56:19.149]  We've quoted several paragraphs of it and in one of them it says that
[00:56:21.613 --> 00:56:22.154]  D.O.D.
[00:56:22.214 --> 00:56:31.382]  might be forced by circumstances to put its broad resources at the disposal of civil authorities to contain and reverse violent threats to domestic tranquility.
[00:56:31.522 --> 00:56:34.144]  Now by the way, that's the new Barack Obama spin.
[00:56:34.184 --> 00:56:37.948]  He goes, well, the Army's gonna be under me, the civil, so it's okay.
[00:56:38.008 --> 00:56:38.488]  No, no, no.
[00:56:38.568 --> 00:56:41.251]  You know, the civil doesn't direct the Army.
[00:56:41.671 --> 00:56:43.132]  And so we gotta get a blurb out on that.
[00:56:43.172 --> 00:56:45.875]  You understand the legalese they're playing here?
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:55.692]  Yeah, and then it says, quote, under the most extreme circumstances, this might include use of military force against hostile groups inside the United States.
[00:56:56.613 --> 00:57:04.104]  So again, it's saying there's going to be civil unrest inside the United States and they're going to have to use military forces to combat it.
[00:57:04.753 --> 00:57:07.435]  That's a new report which we've done a big article on today.
[00:57:07.635 --> 00:57:09.836]  Well, I mean, people have to stop living in denial.
[00:57:09.896 --> 00:57:10.997]  Paul, thanks for coming on.
[00:57:11.017 --> 00:57:11.578]  Appreciate it.
[00:57:12.138 --> 00:57:12.718]  Thanks, Alex.

[00:57:57.179 --> 00:58:00.322]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:58:00.422 --> 00:58:03.505]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:03.885 --> 00:58:05.587]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:06.519 --> 00:58:07.560]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:08.580]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.841]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:09.861 --> 00:58:11.161]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:11.201 --> 00:58:12.862]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:13.222 --> 00:58:19.986]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:20.386 --> 00:58:20.826]  Some U.S.
[00:58:20.866 --> 00:58:26.509]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:27.209 --> 00:58:30.652]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
