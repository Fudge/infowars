[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.511]  Well, we are joined in the next couple of segments by an amazing individual.
[00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:38.136]  Her determination to go and live for months on end, out on the scrub brush, next door to Ford Bush's compound, his fake cowboy set, really became a focal point of a woman they couldn't attack.
[00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:43.078]  She lost her son, who bravely fought in Iraq, and she's Cindy Sheehan.
[00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:45.538]  She has been a great leader to all of us, a great example.
[00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.160]  She's also become a 9-11 Truth leader in the last year.
[00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:58.643]  And I know myself, Willie Nelson, Jessie Ventura, others I've talked to behind the scenes about her, just admire her and think of her every day.
[00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:09.771]  And we just appreciate her running against that monster Nancy Pelosi, that deceiver who said that they would bring justice in the war.
[00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:17.528]  In Peach Bush, and all they've done is protect him, all they've done is fawn after him, and it's just unbelievably evil.
[00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:22.891]  Hundreds of thousands have died in Iraq since they got in almost two years ago.
[00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:32.575]  And if we were to listen to Cindy Sheehan and the other mothers and fathers of these dead troops, close to a million people wouldn't be dead right now.
[00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:37.678]  Cindy Sheehan, thanks for coming on with us, and I'm so glad you're running for the House seat of Nancy Pelosi.
[00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:41.144]  Hi Alex, it's great to be on your show again.
[00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:42.625]  It's great to have you there.
[00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:48.390]  Well, I mean, tell us why you're running, how we can support you, and then let's break down what's happening in the current world and your take on it.
[00:01:49.711 --> 00:02:02.061]  Well, I'm running and I've been on your show a couple times I think since I announced, but I'm running because just like you said, Nancy Pelosi has failed to hold the war criminals,
[00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:09.128]  The criminals against our own constitution are responsible, the Bush regime.
[00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:15.853]  And she has failed to use her power to bring the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:28.122]  And as a matter of fact, she has appropriated a bill with $163 billion that would fund the occupations through next June.
[00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:29.863]  So I think that
[00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:50.284]  The Democrats and the Republicans are co-equally responsible for what's happening in the world today, from the degradation of the environment, to the collapse of our economy, to the astronomical energy prices, to the destruction of our Constitution.
[00:02:50.884 --> 00:02:58.267]  And we have to realize that, that we have to break away from just blind party loyalty
[00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:07.069]  If we're ever going to solve these deep, deep, horrible problems that are plaguing our nation and our world right now.
[00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.170]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:17.394]  And the last time I had you on was probably six, seven months ago when you were considering, if she didn't move to end the war, impeachment to run.
[00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:20.896]  But now you're officially in the heat of this battle.
[00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:21.796]  That was a year ago.
[00:03:21.876 --> 00:03:23.237]  That was a year ago, Alex.
[00:03:23.497 --> 00:03:24.217]  I announced July 23rd.
[00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:28.312]  I don't know.
[00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.553]  And now we're ready to rock and roll in this campaign and just be very aggressive.
[00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:57.536]  Well, I'll tell you this, if there's not election fraud, you should win.
[00:03:57.556 --> 00:03:58.997]  What are the polls trending?
[00:03:59.017 --> 00:03:59.718]  What are they showing?
[00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.420]  Well, we haven't had any polls done yet.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:16.169]  We haven't been able to afford to do any polls, but we're looking into that now because fortunately with Nancy's performance or non-performance, our
[00:04:18.277 --> 00:04:30.307]  Our donations have gone up, so we're going to check in the polls, and I already know what's important to the people of San Francisco, and I'm fully 100% behind there.
[00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:43.697]  As to election fraud, that's always, you know, a major issue, but we're going to have hundreds of people out on election day, sitting on polls, a team of lawyers, and election fraud hotlines.
[00:04:44.082 --> 00:04:47.983]  And we're going to do everything that's possible to try and prevent that.
[00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:52.063]  Well, Nancy Pelosi is really starting to run scared right now.
[00:04:53.044 --> 00:05:03.065]  Our guest is Cindy Sheehan, and she is running against the monster that is the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:05.846]  We're going to talk more with her on the other side of this quick break.
[00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:09.347]  Hi there.
[00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:11.367]  I want to talk to you about a dirty word.
[00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:13.749]  I know, I know.
[00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:17.231]  As the makers of drink and mate hangover defense tablets, we hear it every day.
[00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:23.175]  Grown, respectable adults don't get hangovers.
[00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:31.901]  Hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon the next day.
[00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:32.841]  These days?
[00:05:33.242 --> 00:05:39.406]  Well, sure, sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy.
[00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:41.467]  But that's not really a hangover, is it?
[00:05:42.688 --> 00:05:43.348]  I don't think so.
[00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:19.304]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:21.947]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[00:06:22.307 --> 00:06:25.751]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:37.142]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:38.063]  We're good to go.
[00:06:56.185 --> 00:06:56.525]  Thank you.
[00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:18.531]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:20.874]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:22.557]  But who is the enemy?
[00:07:23.097 --> 00:07:23.618]  Bin Laden.
[00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:24.679]  This is his ammo.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.202]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:07:26.242 --> 00:07:27.864]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:07:28.224 --> 00:07:34.973]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:07:35.374 --> 00:07:35.835]  Some U.S.
[00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:41.642]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:07:42.223 --> 00:07:45.668]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:07:46.088 --> 00:07:53.658]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and warnings.
[00:07:53.838 --> 00:08:01.107]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:04.951]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:16.153]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:16.753 --> 00:08:19.795]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:22.056]  Let's talk Turkey.
[00:08:22.596 --> 00:08:27.419]  Barack Obama is run by the same globalists, same neocons that control George Bush.
[00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:28.560]  He's going to continue all this.
[00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:31.061]  John McCain's going to continue it all.
[00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:33.343]  They're co-guilty as
[00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:42.191]  Sidney Sheehan was just saying, and the Democrats in the House, they voted for the secret warrantless spying on American people.
[00:08:42.712 --> 00:08:50.782]  I got a Washington Post article admitting all the police state upgrades, the federalization, it's all being seamlessly transferred to whoever gets elected.
[00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.271]  The military industrial complex, the bomb makers want it that way.
[00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:56.232]  It's going to be that way.
[00:08:56.732 --> 00:09:04.274]  You have 80 plus percent of the American people in most polls, some say 75, but that's still the majority, who don't want more wars, who don't want all this to happen.
[00:09:04.334 --> 00:09:05.615]  Now, the U.S.
[00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:07.575]  through Georgia has attacked Russia.
[00:09:08.656 --> 00:09:11.577]  The public's so brainwashed that they're being told Russia started it.
[00:09:11.957 --> 00:09:13.417]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:09:13.697 --> 00:09:17.278]  And all these top generals and experts have said this could start World War III.
[00:09:17.318 --> 00:09:18.279]  They want to go into Iran.
[00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:19.960]  It's common sense.
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.001]  It's constitutional.
[00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:21.841]  It's the will of the people.
[00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:23.503]  We need to hold them accountable.
[00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:24.604]  And how do we do that?
[00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:25.605]  Electing.
[00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:33.471]  And that will be a major defeat if we take out these evil Democrats and put real anti-war people like
[00:09:34.352 --> 00:09:35.333]  The great lady we're talking to.
[00:09:35.353 --> 00:09:36.773]  And I don't care if they're Republican or Democrat.
[00:09:36.793 --> 00:09:37.634]  Get us out of the war.
[00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:39.515]  Give us back our liberties and freedoms.
[00:09:39.535 --> 00:09:40.455]  You know, we're taking them back.
[00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.416]  Can you comment on that, Cindy Sheehan?
[00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:45.197]  How important it is for everybody to give you support.
[00:09:45.277 --> 00:09:50.540]  This is one of the most key house races, probably, that I've ever heard of, ever thought of.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:59.364]  I mean, you're going right for one of the twin heads that is allowing this mass murder to continue in Iraq.
[00:10:00.965 --> 00:10:02.165]  That's absolutely right.
[00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.406]  Like we were saying before,
[00:10:04.191 --> 00:10:16.098]  There's very little difference between John McCain and Barack Obama on many key issues that are really important to this country and the world.
[00:10:16.519 --> 00:10:20.721]  Militarism, of course, Barack Obama wants to increase militarism.
[00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:30.187]  He wouldn't be where he was unless he had sold out to the military industrial complex and AIPAC, which John McCain also has.
[00:10:31.108 --> 00:10:38.254]  And he wouldn't be where he is if he wasn't a puppet or a tool of the war machine.
[00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:46.301]  So it's so important to elect independent people like me to Congress to hold these people accountable.
[00:10:46.642 --> 00:10:52.226]  I could have walked into many districts in this country and won easily.
[00:10:52.246 --> 00:10:56.270]  I could have beaten a Republican or
[00:10:56.869 --> 00:11:01.372]  A blue dog Democrat in many, many districts, and it would have been an easy race.
[00:11:01.812 --> 00:11:04.614]  But this is hitting them where it fundamentally hurts.
[00:11:04.734 --> 00:11:14.080]  Nancy Pelosi, no matter what people say, how she's a right-wing liberal, I mean, I'm sorry, a left-wing liberal or whatever, she's not.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.965]  She's also part of the system that suppresses us, oppresses us, and keeps us in these wars.
[00:11:21.065 --> 00:11:25.167]  And attacking them right there is attacking them right in the gut, in the very
[00:11:27.539 --> 00:11:32.182]  You know, I think it is extremely and it's an extremely important election.
[00:11:32.602 --> 00:11:50.631]  And if we take Nancy Pelosi out of her seat, that means that there's going to be 534 members of Congress that know that the American public means business and that we want a true change in direction, not just empty rhetoric, but a true change in course.
[00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:56.034]  And I think this will be very, very significant and a very historical
[00:11:57.007 --> 00:11:57.788]  I don't think so.
[00:12:09.477 --> 00:12:12.338]  Of peace, accountability, and economic equality.
[00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:13.459]  Well, I'll say this, Cindy.
[00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:17.261]  I've come from, quote, the right, but I don't believe in the left-right paradigm anymore.
[00:12:17.281 --> 00:12:19.061]  No, I don't either.
[00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:35.329]  Exactly, but growing up, but I have to say, Democrats wouldn't wake up to some of Bill Clinton's corruption and attack on Serbia, but Republicans have really shown themselves to be slavish to George Bush and all of his evil that isn't even conservative in the classical sense, but just fascist.
[00:12:36.269 --> 00:13:02.942]  Now I have to say, I'm really glad to see a lot of people, quote, on the traditional left, really shattering their paradigm, and really getting it, and getting a lot of courage, and understanding the anti-war movements infiltrated, which has come out by military intelligence and others to neutralize it, and foundation money, who realize, and are saying, yeah, a lot of terror is provocative, terror government-sponsored, and I'm seeing a lot of real courage by what you'd call the traditional left right now.
[00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:03.722]  Can you speak to that?
[00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:11.813]  Well, you know, I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about.
[00:13:13.117 --> 00:13:24.000]  Well I understand some folks just got in your car and what I'm saying is I'm seeing more resistance to this and it being non-partisan from people I see on the left.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.861]  The biggest awakening I'm seeing is on the left.
[00:13:26.881 --> 00:13:31.882]  They're not being taken for a ride by the Democratic Party for year after year being lied to.
[00:13:32.142 --> 00:13:35.943]  They're not as gullible to their own party as Republicans are.
[00:13:37.064 --> 00:13:38.664]  I'm seeing a little shift in that.
[00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.265]  When I first announced last summer
[00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:48.282]  That I was leaving the Democratic Party and then I announced I was running against Nancy Pelosi as an independent.
[00:13:48.302 --> 00:14:03.610]  There was, you know, I got so smeared and attacked so badly by the so-called left that I see that they feel the same sense of betrayal by this two-party system that many of us haven't seen for quite a long time.
[00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.132]  And it's just because of things like Nancy Pelosi
[00:14:07.697 --> 00:14:16.643]  Giving immunity to telecoms and giving George Bush the power to spy on us without warrants.
[00:14:17.083 --> 00:14:23.748]  They see that Nancy Pelosi was briefed on torture in 2002 and she didn't do anything about it.
[00:14:23.768 --> 00:14:29.612]  And they see that the Democratic Congress has the lowest approval rating of any Congress in history.
[00:14:30.092 --> 00:14:32.394]  It has passed the fewest amount of bills
[00:14:33.257 --> 00:14:33.878]  I don't know.
[00:14:47.293 --> 00:14:49.595]  And to not hold George Bush and Dick Cheney accountable.
[00:14:49.615 --> 00:14:51.136]  So people are starting to wake up.
[00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:16.891]  A patriot is a scarce thing, hated and feared and scorned, but in time, when their cause succeeds, or when the proof is in the pudding, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot like Cindy Sheehan.
[00:15:16.931 --> 00:15:22.794]  And now we're a year plus into seeing everything you said being validated, validated, validated.
[00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:24.135]  You're just ahead of the curve.
[00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:24.996]  I'm ahead of the curve.
[00:15:25.476 --> 00:15:26.356]  And that's what I'm saying.
[00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:26.997]  I'm not saying
[00:15:27.597 --> 00:15:35.885]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, Cindy, I'm seeing liberals, I mean, even former Congressman Dan Bird come on here and say, you know, he believes in the Second Amendment now because he understands government's tyrannical.
[00:15:36.245 --> 00:15:46.535]  I'm just seeing the paradigm smash, particularly with the left, and really intellectually getting it, and really, I don't know, I'm just impressed with it.
[00:15:46.595 --> 00:15:51.159]  I mean, are there still throngs of Barack Obama zombies and Pelosi zombies?
[00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:51.440]  Sure!
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:58.301]  I'm just saying, I have to give credit where it's due, and I have to say that the left is really impressing me, that's all I'm saying.
[00:15:59.362 --> 00:16:20.306]  Well, I think that, I do see that, and I agree with you, and I don't feel as lonely as I did a year ago, but then again, when I first started speaking out that this war was illegal and immoral, and George Bush was a liar, and George Bush was a murderer, and George Bush was a terrorist, you know, I felt lonely then, but most of the country eventually caught up with
[00:16:21.141 --> 00:16:29.648]  So I think that, you know, it takes somebody like me who, I don't say I have courage, but I don't really have a whole lot left to lose.
[00:16:30.108 --> 00:16:37.974]  And I can go out front, and I can take the smears, I can take the attacks, because I've buried myself.
[00:16:38.635 --> 00:16:46.356]  And if they think that there's anything that the left or the right or the middle or anybody can do to me that's worse than that, that's not going to happen.
[00:16:46.496 --> 00:16:48.117]  What did Janis Joplin say?
[00:16:48.197 --> 00:16:51.317]  Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose?
[00:16:51.417 --> 00:16:53.398]  Nothing left to lose, absolutely.
[00:16:54.198 --> 00:17:07.880]  And I think with the attacks on our Constitution, with the attacks on our rule of law, with the attacks, like you said, it's becoming a fascist police state, and most people don't even realize how close we are to
[00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:25.519]  Yeah, it's time to get past the partisan bull where you put a Republican hat on so you can't talk to anybody else outside that or ever think, or you put a Democrat hat on and then you can't talk to anybody or think.
[00:17:25.739 --> 00:17:29.921]  We've got to end that, you know, not talking, not debating, not being involved.
[00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:36.265]  Well, and I think also you said that the left has started to awaken to that fact and
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.323]  And I believe that just because someone has a D after their name that they must be good, because we know that's not true.
[00:17:42.403 --> 00:18:03.054]  We know that Bill Clinton was responsible for killing right now maybe as many Iraqis as George Bush has, that he and his policies were just continuing the fascist police state from the Reagan administration and the George Bush administration.
[00:18:03.635 --> 00:18:05.937]  So, you know, that it is non-partisan.
[00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:09.439]  I mean, it's a non-partisan, fascist control of our government.
[00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:14.663]  So we have to join together in a non-partisan way to challenge them.
[00:18:14.723 --> 00:18:17.264]  And it's also people on the right.
[00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:27.872]  And Ron Paul was able to energize a whole, you know, an entire generation of young people who are willing now to stand up for our Constitution and stand up for the rule of law.
[00:18:28.612 --> 00:18:32.555]  And, you know, I don't agree with every policy of Ron Paul.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:40.904]  There's many places we interconnect, being anti-war, anti-imperialism, and anti-police state fascism.
[00:18:41.284 --> 00:18:42.305]  We have to work together.
[00:18:42.345 --> 00:18:43.926]  We have to overlook our differences.
[00:18:45.215 --> 00:18:50.636]  Um, to, to confront this because there's so few of them and there's so many of us.
[00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.076]  Yes.
[00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:52.877]  And we have to reclaim our power.
[00:18:53.017 --> 00:18:53.337]  Yes.
[00:18:53.537 --> 00:18:55.617]  Uh, Cindy, we're going to come back in the final segment with you.
[00:18:56.157 --> 00:18:57.097]  Maybe it'll be a little bit longer.
[00:18:57.117 --> 00:19:00.098]  I know you said we could have more time, but I know you're in your car and you need to get into a meeting.
[00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:05.019]  But before we go to break in one minute, fire out the website, the phone number, volunteers, money.
[00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:09.180]  People want to help you bring down Nancy Pelosi and hopefully bring this war to an end.
[00:19:10.827 --> 00:19:22.631]  Cindy4Congress.org, Cindy4Congress.org, all the contact information, our address, our phone number is on the website.
[00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:24.231]  And people can give nationwide?
[00:19:24.271 --> 00:19:24.852]  They can give nationwide?
[00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:25.812]  They can give nationwide.
[00:19:26.152 --> 00:19:35.395]  We've been able to raise almost $400,000 now, and it's come from donations from $5 all the way up to the maximum donation from just people.
[00:19:35.805 --> 00:19:37.630]  We won't take any money from AIPAC.
[00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:44.867]  We won't take any money from corporate lobbyists who earn their money from oppressing people and violence.
[00:19:45.322 --> 00:19:47.424]  You know, Cindy, I don't want to waste any of my time with you.
[00:19:48.085 --> 00:19:53.451]  I'm going to skip this four-minute break and then come back right at the bottom of the hour at 30 after.
[00:19:53.831 --> 00:19:56.174]  So we've got exactly 10 minutes left with Cindy Sheehan.
[00:19:56.194 --> 00:20:00.899]  We're going to skip this break for all the InfoWars.com stream listeners, that exclusive stream.
[00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:01.419]  Got to go there.
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.501]  Not the GCN stream, but the InfoWars stream.
[00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:06.044]  And, of course, watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:20:06.204 --> 00:20:06.745]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:09.129 --> 00:20:18.076]  Cindy, let's continue with grassroots, what people can do who are in California, who are on the West Coast particularly, but also nationwide.
[00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:20.278]  I mean, people can call in to talk shows.
[00:20:20.298 --> 00:20:23.761]  If they're in New York, they can call San Francisco talk shows.
[00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:25.042]  I mean, explain your district.
[00:20:25.362 --> 00:20:26.283]  I mean, there's so much.
[00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.564]  Letter-writing campaigns, postcards.
[00:20:28.965 --> 00:20:32.608]  I mean, if everybody does a little bit, we can get you elected.
[00:20:33.368 --> 00:20:33.608]  Yes.
[00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:34.469]  Awesome.
[00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:36.070]  Tell folks about that right now.
[00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.651]  We're still on air.
[00:20:38.994 --> 00:20:41.296]  I just skipped the break.
[00:20:41.396 --> 00:20:43.397]  Alright, awesome.
[00:20:44.217 --> 00:20:47.739]  Well, let me see, where do we start?
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.641]  First of all, we accept donations.
[00:20:51.201 --> 00:20:52.462]  No amount is too small.
[00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:57.565]  We put every dollar to work in our campaign office.
[00:20:57.985 --> 00:21:06.390]  We are going to have a grassroots section that's coming up really soon where people from outside the district, like you said, could phone bank for us.
[00:21:06.963 --> 00:21:12.445]  They can send postcards inside the district to people explaining why they support me.
[00:21:14.186 --> 00:21:17.647]  We are going to have canvassing and voter registration.
[00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:27.670]  There's so many people in San Francisco who are not registered to vote that are, you know, they're qualified to be registered to vote, but they're not.
[00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:32.792]  They have felt so left out of the process for the last few decades.
[00:21:33.297 --> 00:21:41.539]  When the corporate control and the established elitists have taken control of the country, and that's the only people that Nancy Pelosi represents.
[00:21:41.579 --> 00:21:47.761]  She doesn't represent my neighbor on the street who can't afford to buy gas.
[00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:50.542]  They're losing their homes and their jobs.
[00:21:51.062 --> 00:21:55.583]  So we're going to do a very targeted grassroots voter registration.
[00:21:55.683 --> 00:21:56.463]  Get out the vote.
[00:21:56.844 --> 00:22:01.485]  We're going to give people... Nancy Pelosi always brags that she gives 80% of the votes
[00:22:02.503 --> 00:22:08.664]  She gets 80% of about 20 to 25% of the people who actually come out to vote.
[00:22:08.704 --> 00:22:11.845]  So that's a very, very small percentage.
[00:22:12.265 --> 00:22:20.986]  So we're going to energize people who haven't voted for a long time to go back to the polls, to give them a reason to go back and vote.
[00:22:21.326 --> 00:22:24.367]  We collected almost 20,000 signatures.
[00:22:24.787 --> 00:22:29.268]  That's halfway to what we need to defeat Nancy Pelosi.
[00:22:30.473 --> 00:22:33.335]  In November, and we haven't even started campaigning yet.
[00:22:33.775 --> 00:22:59.168]  So I think that with the help of people around America who realize the historic importance of this election, who realize that they have to do more, not write your congressperson now, you know, not support the two-party duopoly that really is just one party, but work for a candidate who will bring
[00:23:00.444 --> 00:23:02.965]  Just fundamental change who will start?
[00:23:04.226 --> 00:23:06.187]  You know, I'm a supporter of the Constitution.
[00:23:06.327 --> 00:23:12.430]  I believe that we have, I believe in the Second Amendment, that we have a right to keep and bear arms.
[00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:17.213]  And we know, historically, that was to protect us from the government.
[00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:23.096]  But I am just fearful of an armed revolution against this government.
[00:23:23.416 --> 00:23:27.058]  They have Blackwater, they have, you know, every conceivable
[00:23:27.725 --> 00:23:34.471]  Well, Nancy, studying the history of warfare, they will lose if that physical fight starts.
[00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:39.275]  But what we might get out of the revolution, maybe an even worse government, is what history shows.
[00:23:39.315 --> 00:23:40.636]  We can certainly win it.
[00:23:40.696 --> 00:23:41.217]  Every time.
[00:23:41.677 --> 00:23:43.799]  Every time we've gotten a worse government.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:51.486]  So I believe that taking out Nancy Pelosi is just an amazingly peaceful revolution.
[00:23:51.506 --> 00:23:53.448]  We want something like Gandhi did.
[00:23:54.611 --> 00:23:55.892]  We want what Gandhi did.
[00:23:55.932 --> 00:23:57.492]  We want a bloodless revolution.
[00:23:57.512 --> 00:23:58.272]  We all know it really wasn't.
[00:23:58.292 --> 00:23:58.853]  Absolutely.
[00:23:58.873 --> 00:23:59.373]  Totally bloodless.
[00:23:59.393 --> 00:24:01.414]  We're going to come back to the full audience right now.
[00:24:01.434 --> 00:24:02.934]  We were behind the scenes just on the internet.
[00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:04.115]  Now we're going to come back.
[00:24:04.395 --> 00:24:07.096]  I want to talk about is Nancy Pelosi scared of you and where this is going.
[00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:07.456]  Here we go.
[00:24:10.117 --> 00:24:15.259]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:15.939 --> 00:24:18.220]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:21.684 --> 00:24:27.831]  We are streaming this live as television over the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:24:28.652 --> 00:24:30.575]  And we just came back out of the break.
[00:24:30.595 --> 00:24:31.616]  We skipped that break.
[00:24:31.936 --> 00:24:33.238]  Some stations, though, carried that break.
[00:24:33.818 --> 00:24:40.827]  In the time we've got left, you said such incredibly eloquent things there, Cindy Sheehan, and people should support you right now.
[00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:41.688]  I'm going to support you.
[00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:48.357]  But before we run out of time here, is Nancy Pelosi starting to get scared?
[00:24:48.437 --> 00:24:49.438]  Is she concerned?
[00:24:49.758 --> 00:24:53.599]  Because we know that you're wildly popular, especially in that area of California.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:09.606]  Well, Nancy Pelosi, you know, she's on her book tour in her very ironically titled book, Know Your Power, when she has abdicated her power, or like we said, used her power just to support the status quo, you know, the fascist police state.
[00:25:10.107 --> 00:25:12.988]  But at her book signing in San Francisco,
[00:25:13.596 --> 00:25:18.598]  I heard, I wasn't there, but I heard that people chanted Cindy, Cindy, Cindy for five minutes.
[00:25:19.418 --> 00:25:31.642]  And just the way they started to invalidate our signatures and starting to scrub the voter rolls in San Francisco from the people who support me, I think that they're very terrified.
[00:25:32.142 --> 00:25:36.283]  They're terrified and all they care about is retaining their power.
[00:25:36.843 --> 00:25:39.664]  And all I care about is turning this country around.
[00:25:40.106 --> 00:25:42.587]  And that's what I've been doing since my son died.
[00:25:42.627 --> 00:25:48.509]  I've sacrificed everything to make this country the country that they say Casey died for.
[00:25:48.889 --> 00:25:58.332]  For my surviving children, for my new grandchild, but not just for them, but for the children and grandchildren of everybody all over the world.
[00:25:58.372 --> 00:26:02.113]  When America is healthy, then the rest of the planet will be healthy.
[00:26:02.874 --> 00:26:07.175]  And I think that with your support, with the support of your listeners,
[00:26:07.717 --> 00:26:12.424]  And other people around America that I can do it, and I don't feel like I'm there by myself.
[00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:13.806]  I don't call it my campaign.
[00:26:13.846 --> 00:26:15.268]  I call it our campaign.
[00:26:15.368 --> 00:26:20.475]  If there's ever been a campaign in American history that was the people's campaign, this is it.
[00:26:23.246 --> 00:26:24.107]  Look, look at the costs.
[00:26:24.127 --> 00:26:24.887]  They're not going to stop.
[00:26:24.907 --> 00:26:26.308]  They're trying to start war with Russia.
[00:26:26.688 --> 00:26:28.230]  They're trying to reignite the Cold War.
[00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.072]  I mean, this craziness isn't going to end until we put our foot down.
[00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:35.234]  And I just appreciate you as a champion getting there and doing that.
[00:26:35.274 --> 00:26:38.116]  People should support you financially and by getting the word out.
[00:26:38.377 --> 00:26:40.018]  We'll get that side out in a moment before you leave us.
[00:26:40.058 --> 00:26:42.560]  But getting back into the fascist police state.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:52.545]  PDD 51, all these police state measures, the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, camps for the American people, a secret prison in Denver, all of that's happening.
[00:26:52.585 --> 00:27:02.451]  Are you concerned about another false flag or another stage 9-11 as a pretext or even with a new administration so the military-industrial complex can continue to move forward?
[00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:06.393]  Well, as you know, the Presidential Directive 51,
[00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:19.946]  It gives George Bush the right to declare martial law without congressional approval, but it doesn't have to be a terrorist attack.
[00:27:20.006 --> 00:27:27.772]  It could also, he could declare martial law economic or a natural disaster.
[00:27:27.792 --> 00:27:35.838]  So, you know, yes, that's very terrifying and many people think that they're not going to even allow the elections to happen in November.
[00:27:36.539 --> 00:27:41.081]  So if there was ever a time that the people need to take back their power, it's today.
[00:27:41.402 --> 00:27:41.842]  You're right.
[00:27:41.882 --> 00:27:43.142]  This is the time to be vigilant.
[00:27:43.162 --> 00:27:44.183]  This is the crossroads.
[00:27:44.483 --> 00:27:46.444]  This is when the global system is liquid.
[00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:49.526]  Things are changing fast for good or ill.
[00:27:49.846 --> 00:27:51.647]  We're going to be the difference we want to see in the world.
[00:27:51.687 --> 00:28:00.652]  Like Gandhi said, look in the mirror every day and that's where you're going to find the solution with our creator's help and with great champions out there like Cindy Sheehan.
[00:28:00.672 --> 00:28:01.292]  9-11 investigation.
[00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:07.836]  Now all these Republican memos come out saying we need a new 9-11.
[00:28:07.856 --> 00:28:08.416]  9-11 would be great.
[00:28:08.496 --> 00:28:17.622]  Cy Hirsch reports that Dick Cheney just proposed attacking our own ships with fake PT boats with Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians.
[00:28:18.022 --> 00:28:20.043]  Would you like to see a bigger investigation of that?
[00:28:21.304 --> 00:28:27.267]  Well, you know, I have always called for a valid investigation into 9-11.
[00:28:28.587 --> 00:28:38.515]  That has nothing to do with the government, but has experts and subpoena power, and that we, um, these people need to swear an oath.
[00:28:38.655 --> 00:28:42.518]  Like, that just cracks me up because they don't care about swearing oaths.
[00:28:43.018 --> 00:28:44.999]  You know, that means nothing to them.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.621]  But yes, definitely.
[00:28:47.041 --> 00:28:51.384]  And I have the families of 9-11 to call for that.
[00:28:51.404 --> 00:28:53.606]  The 9-11 investigation that we had was a joke.
[00:28:55.427 --> 00:29:06.556]  What do you think of the courage of Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and the former Italian president and the best actress this year, Winner, all coming out saying inside job.
[00:29:06.576 --> 00:29:07.337]  What do you think about that?
[00:29:08.338 --> 00:29:10.019]  Well, you know, I think that takes a lot of courage.
[00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:13.062]  And as you know, Alex, I've never said inside job.
[00:29:13.322 --> 00:29:17.145]  I've never been convinced by anybody that it wasn't inside job.
[00:29:17.165 --> 00:29:20.247]  You just say it needs to be investigated.
[00:29:20.388 --> 00:29:22.509]  You know that I think that there's so many
[00:29:23.982 --> 00:29:30.488]  Irregularities and so many questionable things that happen that I'm not ruling Inside Job out.
[00:29:31.128 --> 00:29:31.549]  At all.
[00:29:32.329 --> 00:29:33.691]  But I haven't been convinced of that.
[00:29:33.731 --> 00:29:39.996]  But you did, I mean, did you hear two weeks ago, even the Keepoverman covered it, that Cheney wanted to attack our ships with fake Iranian boats?
[00:29:40.016 --> 00:29:40.256]  I did.
[00:29:40.456 --> 00:29:41.157]  No, I heard that.
[00:29:41.237 --> 00:29:41.738]  I heard that.
[00:29:41.818 --> 00:29:43.299]  I mean, that's bombshell, isn't it?
[00:29:43.319 --> 00:29:44.340]  That's what they wanted to do.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.342]  That's what they wanted to do for a loss.
[00:29:46.422 --> 00:29:49.004]  They wanted to... Tell you what, I'm going to skip this break, Cindy.
[00:29:49.024 --> 00:29:49.985]  Stay there for three more minutes.
[00:29:51.886 --> 00:29:54.468]  We're talking to Cindy Sheehan, behind the scenes at Infowars.com.
[00:29:55.869 --> 00:29:57.650]  Okay, Cindy, we've got three minutes left here.
[00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.092]  This is going out over the internet, then it's put up on YouTube and everywhere.
[00:30:01.093 --> 00:30:02.334]  Continue finishing up with that.
[00:30:02.374 --> 00:30:11.041]  I mean, that's a big deal when we get these... Well, I think they wanted to provoke Saddam into attacking us, because they knew they couldn't get the U.N.
[00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:11.861]  resolution.
[00:30:11.901 --> 00:30:12.422]  White House memo.
[00:30:12.442 --> 00:30:13.963]  These people are monsters.
[00:30:13.983 --> 00:30:18.927]  These people will stop at nothing to have all the power, all the money,
[00:30:19.474 --> 00:30:19.895]  Yeah.
[00:30:33.329 --> 00:30:36.610]  A very strong investigation into 9-11.
[00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.311]  Well, exactly.
[00:30:37.351 --> 00:30:38.091]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:30:38.231 --> 00:30:42.693]  We have Cy Hirsch saying, oh, my White House source, they plan to attack 12 targets.
[00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:49.455]  One of them was to create fake Iranian boats in our shipyards, put Navy SEALs on board and have them attack our ships and have a shootout.
[00:30:50.316 --> 00:30:52.296]  And then somebody in the White House overruled him.
[00:30:52.336 --> 00:30:53.037]  My point is,
[00:30:54.216 --> 00:30:56.117]  Then we have the White House memo, flying U.S.
[00:30:56.157 --> 00:30:57.879]  planes low, painted like U.N.
[00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:01.921]  But this is even worse, though, to actually attack our own ships.
[00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:04.163]  I mean, that's Cy Hirsch, that's Keith Olbermann.
[00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:08.746]  I mean, you've got a big voice, Cindy, I know you're bringing that up, but will you bring that up to the media?
[00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:13.849]  Well, you know, I have whenever I have an opportunity.
[00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.751]  No, I know, you've just got a lot of power.
[00:31:16.851 --> 00:31:18.973]  I'm glad I have the opportunity today.
[00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:20.934]  Well, you're just awesome.
[00:31:21.134 --> 00:31:23.636]  Did that blow you away when you heard that Cheney was planning that?
[00:31:25.816 --> 00:31:29.518]  You know, nothing that these people do blow me away anymore.
[00:31:30.198 --> 00:31:31.679]  You know what blows me away?
[00:31:31.699 --> 00:31:34.861]  Is that we have allowed them to get away with it.
[00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:35.441]  Yes.
[00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:37.582]  That's what blows me away Alex.
[00:31:37.602 --> 00:31:38.783]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:31:38.823 --> 00:31:41.724]  Well, you're not letting them get away with it and we just appreciate you.
[00:31:41.764 --> 00:31:43.565]  Give out the congressional website one more time.
[00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:50.772]  Cindy4Congress.org I don't want to put you on the spot.
[00:31:50.792 --> 00:31:55.954]  I know you're in a car waiting to go into an event on the campaign trail, but do you have the phone numbers?
[00:31:55.974 --> 00:32:02.636]  We have a lot of AM and FM shortwave satellite listeners that aren't at computers and don't have computers that want to call you, a lot of elderly.
[00:32:02.776 --> 00:32:04.077]  Yes, I do.
[00:32:04.177 --> 00:32:04.837]  It's Erica 415-621-5027.
[00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:05.677]  Give it out again.
[00:32:05.697 --> 00:32:05.737]  415-621-5027.
[00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.072]  I'm doing an anti-war concert.
[00:32:18.112 --> 00:32:23.017]  It's already set up, but I don't want to announce it until a little bit in October with Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura.
[00:32:23.057 --> 00:32:25.839]  Maybe we can fly you in here or get you in there to be a speaker.
[00:32:25.859 --> 00:32:27.501]  I don't want to put too many speakers in there.
[00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:28.762]  I'll end up not having time to speak.
[00:32:29.122 --> 00:32:32.946]  But maybe we'll get you into Austin, Cindy, and I'll call your... Oh, that would be great.
[00:32:33.046 --> 00:32:33.907]  I love Austin.
[00:32:33.947 --> 00:32:35.128]  I miss my friends there.
[00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:37.530]  Well, I mean, I know you lived right outside it for a year.
[00:32:40.188 --> 00:32:43.830]  How long total, if you put it all the times together, were you out there at Camp Casey and before?
[00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:46.011]  Oh, gosh.
[00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:48.352]  Months, like you said.
[00:32:48.612 --> 00:32:49.893]  Yeah, off and on a lot.
[00:32:50.233 --> 00:32:53.334]  Okay, well, SendingForCongress.org, you said?
[00:32:53.354 --> 00:32:54.535]  Yes.
[00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:56.816]  Okay, thank you for everything you're doing.
[00:32:56.836 --> 00:32:57.817]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:32:57.857 --> 00:33:01.659]  Hopefully we can come back on and update you on how things are going.
[00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:02.519]  Please do.
[00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:06.001]  You've got a platform, and we'll just call you in a month and check in with you.
[00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:06.481]  God bless you.
[00:33:07.463 --> 00:33:07.804]  Awesome.
[00:33:07.824 --> 00:33:09.609]  God bless you all and your listeners, too.
[00:33:09.649 --> 00:33:10.291]  Thank you.
[00:33:10.451 --> 00:33:10.712]  You bet.
[00:33:10.752 --> 00:33:11.614]  There goes Cindy Sheehan.
[00:33:11.875 --> 00:33:12.436]  Bye-bye, Cindy.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.241]  Okay, here we go.
[00:33:19.582 --> 00:33:21.223]  You know, I'm going to play part of two songs.
[00:33:21.323 --> 00:33:26.466]  Let's play Top Ranking, because I've been skipping so many breaks, I need a break to go to the lavatory, the boys' room, as they say.
[00:33:27.186 --> 00:33:32.569]  And then, I know we played it once on air, I know you've got it in cue, that Janis Joplin, Freedom, or whatever the name of the song is.
[00:33:32.949 --> 00:33:40.013]  Freedom's just another word for nothing else to lose, and there's nothing, there's nothing if you ain't free, or whatever she says.
[00:33:40.613 --> 00:33:43.435]  Try to cue that up, but get me Top Ranking, I need to... It's ready.
[00:33:43.455 --> 00:33:46.977]  The point is, I love this song so bad, I won't even have time to get out of here, I have to sit here and listen to it.
[00:33:47.597 --> 00:33:48.398]  This says it all.
[00:33:48.458 --> 00:33:53.260]  Again, I have always built people up, brought countless people on to raise money.
[00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.121]  Unilisters have given, given, given.
[00:33:55.662 --> 00:34:00.324]  We have come on here selflessly to build up other talk shows, other filmmakers, everybody.
[00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:06.808]  And we just all need to come together and fight the New World Order and stop killing each other.
[00:34:06.848 --> 00:34:07.348]  That's what they want.
[00:34:07.369 --> 00:34:10.190]  They want us fighting, fussing and fighting, and killing each other.
[00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:16.494]  And I have so much brotherly love for people, but I do get just, not even enraged, it's like disgusted
[00:34:17.401 --> 00:34:29.731]  with the fact that so many bad people know that there's power in the anti-new world order movement and get into it and we have to identify these wolves and we have to route them out but then that itself becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of just infighting.
[00:34:30.391 --> 00:34:35.916]  Let's just listen to the words of the Rasta man, Mr. Naughty Dread.
[00:34:35.956 --> 00:34:36.376]  Here it is.
[00:34:36.396 --> 00:34:43.122]  They don't want to see us
[00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:47.658]  No, I want to see us fussing and fighting!
[00:34:48.959 --> 00:34:54.880]  All they want us to do is keep on fussing and fighting.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.440]  They don't want to see us live together.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:08.842]  All they want us to do is keep on killing one another.
[00:35:08.862 --> 00:35:10.283]  Top ranking!
[00:35:10.723 --> 00:35:11.983]  Top ranking!
[00:35:13.717 --> 00:35:15.338]  Did you mean what you said?
[00:35:15.358 --> 00:35:15.718]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:15.778 --> 00:35:16.579]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:19.140]  And boy, your lies blew up in your face, didn't they?
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:19.621]  Oh, Top Rankin'!
[00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:20.541]  Top Rankin'!
[00:35:20.681 --> 00:35:21.522]  Oh, did you mean what you said?
[00:35:21.542 --> 00:35:21.962]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:21.982 --> 00:35:22.342]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:22.382 --> 00:35:22.863]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:22.983 --> 00:35:23.383]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:23.423 --> 00:35:24.043]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:24.063 --> 00:35:24.664]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:24.684 --> 00:35:25.164]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:25.184 --> 00:35:25.844]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:25.864 --> 00:35:26.865]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:26.885 --> 00:35:27.385]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:27.546 --> 00:35:28.306]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:28.466 --> 00:35:30.107]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:30.267 --> 00:35:31.128]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:31.148 --> 00:35:31.648]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:31.668 --> 00:35:32.148]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:32.669]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:32.689 --> 00:35:33.509]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:33.529 --> 00:35:33.989]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.350]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.871]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:36.251]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:36.371 --> 00:35:37.352]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:37.372 --> 00:35:37.792]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:37.832 --> 00:35:38.332]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:38.452 --> 00:35:39.373]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:39.393 --> 00:35:40.493]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:40.614 --> 00:35:41.254]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:41.434 --> 00:35:41.954]  Are you skankin'?
[00:35:41.974 --> 00:35:42.335]  Are you sk
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.262]  John saw them coming.
[00:35:47.342 --> 00:35:53.487]  The brotherly love.
[00:35:53.567 --> 00:35:54.748]  The sisterly love.
[00:36:14.158 --> 00:36:15.379]  I feel this morning.
[00:36:20.864 --> 00:36:23.025]  Never accuse me of what you are.
[00:36:23.045 --> 00:36:25.447]  You know, you don't really hate me.
[00:36:25.507 --> 00:36:26.968]  You hate yourselves.
[00:36:27.229 --> 00:36:27.769]  My enemies.
[00:36:27.929 --> 00:36:38.558]  And I take no pleasure that you're imprisoned inside your own evil mind.
[00:36:39.979 --> 00:36:41.921]  All they want us to do is keep on fussing.
[00:36:45.013 --> 00:36:47.335]  You guys are laughing at me.
[00:36:47.555 --> 00:36:55.581]  No, I know I sound funny, but that's from my heart.
[00:36:55.641 --> 00:36:57.723]  I love everybody.
[00:37:13.951 --> 00:37:17.113]  Yeah, you're a bunch of skanks.
[00:37:19.214 --> 00:37:23.656]  Dirty, creepy, little back-biting, back-stabbing devils.
[00:37:24.016 --> 00:37:25.237]  Skankin', skankin'!
[00:37:28.038 --> 00:37:28.658]  Yeah!
[00:37:31.019 --> 00:37:31.800]  Top Rankin'!
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.603]  Alright, did you find my Janice Joplin?
[00:37:38.655 --> 00:37:39.335]  I'm still looking for it.
[00:37:39.355 --> 00:37:41.015]  You're still looking for my Janis Joplin?
[00:37:41.256 --> 00:37:44.616]  It's in that evil, confounded, 12-year-old computer they have up there.
[00:37:45.436 --> 00:37:47.077]  They torture John with the equipment up there.
[00:37:48.697 --> 00:37:50.537]  Oh man, I am just exhausted.
[00:37:51.437 --> 00:37:52.818]  I got up at like 6 a.m.
[00:37:52.838 --> 00:37:57.959]  yesterday, then I was on coast-to-coast last night, and I got work to do just to the rafters.
[00:37:58.599 --> 00:37:59.639]  To the rafters.
[00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:01.599]  But you know what?
[00:38:01.719 --> 00:38:02.680]  It is rewarding.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.040]  I am so alive.
[00:38:05.988 --> 00:38:08.149]  I just, I also want to just somehow slow down.
[00:38:08.189 --> 00:38:11.792]  I love working, but I can't even get off of the treadmill.
[00:38:14.433 --> 00:38:17.375]  I am just like continually focused on this.
[00:38:18.636 --> 00:38:20.537]  Well, there's a great story up on JonesReport.com.
[00:38:20.577 --> 00:38:33.905]  I talked about it back in the first hour, and when the show restarts on InfoWars.com, on the exclusive streams there, the higher quality streams, more streams, better streams, there at the InfoWars.com streams, when the show's over in about 21 minutes,
[00:38:35.509 --> 00:38:36.350]  He will restart.
[00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.290]  We will be right back.
[00:38:38.051 --> 00:38:43.875]  And I went over that because it's pointless for me to go over that now because I'm going to go over it again when we start that other hour.
[00:38:44.335 --> 00:38:47.917]  But I wanted to get into some of the other environmental news here.
[00:38:49.198 --> 00:38:50.399]  I want to hear Janis Joplin.
[00:38:50.419 --> 00:38:51.940]  My bones need to hear that song.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.281]  That's Tommy McGee's the name of the song.
[00:38:54.682 --> 00:38:55.222]  Bobby McGee.
[00:38:55.262 --> 00:38:55.883]  Bobby McGee.
[00:38:55.903 --> 00:38:56.283]  There you go.
[00:38:56.303 --> 00:38:56.983]  It's downloading.
[00:38:57.324 --> 00:38:58.184]  It's downloading.
[00:38:58.204 --> 00:38:59.285]  Oh, we're having to grab it again.
[00:39:02.483 --> 00:39:03.644]  Chris Christopherson wrote that.
[00:39:03.844 --> 00:39:04.484]  That's interesting.
[00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:06.765]  That's right, because they were going out together.
[00:39:07.105 --> 00:39:08.286]  They just popped in in here.
[00:39:08.786 --> 00:39:11.347]  I can't even get these names straight.
[00:39:11.427 --> 00:39:12.587]  The Goodly Trey.
[00:39:12.607 --> 00:39:15.869]  Can I see the other goodly creatures out the window?
[00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:18.170]  You know what?

[00:39:39.228 --> 00:39:41.129]  That's it.
[00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:43.471]  God, I hate vampires.
[00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:45.713]  Psychic vampires are just everywhere.
[00:39:46.693 --> 00:39:47.033]  It's ready.
[00:39:47.514 --> 00:39:48.174]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:39:48.214 --> 00:39:51.657]  This is a song dedicated to all the psychic vampires out there.
[00:39:51.717 --> 00:39:55.920]  Miserable creatures that will be defeated trying to suck the blood.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.001]  Much too long!
[00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:03.702]  Rebellion!

[00:42:39.577 --> 00:42:42.439]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, the immortal Bob Marley.
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:47.803]  The Babylon system is the vampire.
[00:42:49.164 --> 00:42:54.988]  I'm going to play part of Bobby McGee, and here it is for you, ladies and gentlemen, on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[00:42:55.008 --> 00:43:01.533]  I'm going to come back and hit some final news for the last 15 minutes in the zone here before retransmission launches.
[00:43:02.153 --> 00:43:04.655]  T-minus 16 minutes.
[00:43:05.015 --> 00:43:05.516]  Stay with us.
[00:43:09.298 --> 00:43:35.229]  Busted flat in Baton Rouge Waitin' for a train And I feel the nearest faded as my jeans Bobby thumbed a diesel down Just before it rained And rode us all the way to New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
[00:43:36.042 --> 00:44:00.108]  I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues When she walked through slappin' time I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine We sang every song that Daddy knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose Nothin', I mean nothin', honey, if it ain't free

[00:44:20.436 --> 00:44:25.319]  From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun.
[00:44:25.439 --> 00:44:29.802]  Hey Bobby, share the secrets of my soul.
[00:44:30.442 --> 00:44:35.525]  Through all kinds of weather, through everything we've done.
[00:44:35.545 --> 00:44:38.327]  Yeah, Bobby, baby, kept me moving.
[00:44:41.019 --> 00:45:09.829]  One day I'll miss Selena so long I let him slip away He's looking for that home And I hope he finds it But I trade all of my tomorrows For one single yesterday To be waiting Bobby's body next to mine Waiting is just another word for Nothing left to lose Nothing That's all that Bobby left me

[00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:41.356]  Back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:45:41.376 --> 00:45:44.098]  with an abbreviated beginning of the week transmission.
[00:45:45.609 --> 00:46:02.992]  It's a free podcast at InfoWars.com where there's 60,000 people a day and growing are downloading the free podcast at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with their MP3 or iPod device to listen to how they want, when they want, where they want.
[00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:11.694]  Millions and millions every month tune in just over the internet to listen to the radio show, to read the shoutcast stats.
[00:46:11.714 --> 00:46:12.694]  Click on stats at the top
[00:46:13.499 --> 00:46:22.481]  Millions more listen on a growing list of fabulous Aminathem affiliates and good old WWCR, Worldwide Shortwave International Service, as well as Satellite.
[00:46:23.922 --> 00:46:25.982]  We're thankful to all the listeners, the sponsors.
[00:46:26.802 --> 00:46:31.984]  We're thankful for everyone that has made this show possible and who have resonated with the message that we've brought forward.
[00:46:32.024 --> 00:46:34.044]  And together, we have woken up tens of millions.
[00:46:34.064 --> 00:46:35.945]  We will wake up tens of millions more.
[00:46:36.285 --> 00:46:41.486]  And we're going to give this New World Order dehumanization system one hell of a fight, thanks to all of you and the good Lord above.
[00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:48.252]  I've got some final news I want to hit in the fifteen minutes that we have left here today.
[00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:59.258]  Of course, there's a key story up on PrisonPlanet.com that I covered in detail earlier in the show that I'll rebroadcast in a few minutes, but a Russian general says Georgia may commit false flag terror attacks.
[00:46:59.298 --> 00:47:07.763]  The deputy head of the Russian military, number two, says that he's afraid U.S.-backed forces may pose as Russian military and stage false flag events.
[00:47:07.823 --> 00:47:09.324]  Now, the Russians are not angels.
[00:47:09.364 --> 00:47:10.585]  If you remember, they could do that as well.
[00:47:10.885 --> 00:47:13.489]  Just be aware of the false flag type operation.
[00:47:14.029 --> 00:47:19.617]  Also speaking of Georgia, Joe Biden promises Georgia a billion dollars.
[00:47:20.118 --> 00:47:27.187]  The Senate fixture from Delaware, this is by Kurt Nemo, Infoworks.com, Joe Biden has promised to give your money to the
[00:47:28.891 --> 00:47:32.133]  Horn dictator, Chakasvili, and Georgia.
[00:47:32.173 --> 00:47:35.595]  The United States will consider providing $1 billion in emergency aid to Georgia, a top U.S.
[00:47:35.635 --> 00:47:41.439]  lawmaker said today, on his return from a visit to the conflict-torn nation, reports Dow Jones Newswire.
[00:47:41.979 --> 00:47:49.083]  When Congress reconvenes, I intend to work with the administration to seek congressional approval for $1 billion in emergency assistance from Georgia, said Biden.
[00:47:49.103 --> 00:47:57.769]  This money will help the people of Georgia recover from the damage that has been inflicted on our country, our economy, and send a clear message that the United States will not abandon this young democracy.
[00:47:59.068 --> 00:48:03.089]  Actually, Biden has promised to jack the debt up another billion or so.
[00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.409]  The U.S.
[00:48:03.429 --> 00:48:09.991]  debt is now over $100 trillion, so that a mere billion, the government says, is debt, is only $10 trillion.
[00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:15.612]  But the Federal Reserve and the Federal Express says it's closer to $100 trillion, which means
[00:48:18.487 --> 00:48:19.867]  It is over that amount.
[00:48:20.327 --> 00:48:22.668]  At any rate, Biden is simply taking orders from the globalists.
[00:48:22.968 --> 00:48:24.969]  Biden is the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
[00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:31.310]  It might well be called the Council on Foreign Relations Committee, because that's where the marching orders come from.
[00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:41.272]  Russia punched some pretty big holes in the globalist plan for Little Georgia, and the CIA created client state, so the American people have to ante up.
[00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.293]  And it goes on a little bit more from there.
[00:48:46.175 --> 00:48:52.959]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, Credit Crunch may take out large U.S.
[00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:56.021]  bank Warren's former IMF chief.
[00:48:56.642 --> 00:49:09.189]  They told us eight months ago that the bank foreclosures and the bank collapses were over and the housing foreclosures were over and it just got worse two months later and then they told us six months ago it was getting better and then a couple months later it's got worse and got worse last month and it's worse this month.
[00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:11.391]  The deepening
[00:49:12.796 --> 00:49:16.919]  Toll from global financial crisis could trigger the failure of a large U.S.
[00:49:16.939 --> 00:49:24.964]  bank within months, a respected former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund claimed today, fueling another battering for banking shares.
[00:49:26.005 --> 00:49:40.054]  Professor Kenneth Rogoff, a leading academic economist, said that there was yet worse news to come from the worldwide credit crunch and financial turmoil, particularly in the United States, and that a high-profile
[00:49:41.175 --> 00:49:43.322]  Casualty among American banks was highly likely.
[00:49:43.783 --> 00:49:44.365]  The U.S.
[00:49:44.586 --> 00:49:46.291]  is not out of the woods.
[00:49:46.431 --> 00:49:46.732]  What is it?
[00:49:46.752 --> 00:49:47.414]  Bank of America?
[00:49:47.454 --> 00:49:48.096]  Is it Citibank?
[00:49:48.136 --> 00:49:48.618]  Who's next?
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:52.302]  I think the financial crisis is at the halfway point, perhaps.
[00:49:52.642 --> 00:49:55.044]  I would even go further to say that the worst is yet to come.
[00:49:55.764 --> 00:49:58.406]  Professor Rogoff said at a conference in Singapore.
[00:49:58.886 --> 00:50:04.390]  In an ominous warning, he added, we're just not going to see mid-sized banks go under.
[00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:07.232]  We're not just going to see mid-sized banks go under the next few months.
[00:50:07.552 --> 00:50:09.233]  We're going to see a whopper.
[00:50:09.554 --> 00:50:11.215]  We're going to see a big one.
[00:50:11.635 --> 00:50:15.798]  One of the big investment banks, or the big banks, he said, rising anxieties.
[00:50:17.742 --> 00:50:22.165]  Over worse to come in the credit crisis since shares tumbling in Europe and Asia.
[00:50:24.066 --> 00:50:29.769]  And then it gets into all of that news and information for you.
[00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:32.411]  When we come back, I want to get into the latest global warming.
[00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:39.940]  Which means global tax, global regulation, social workers managing every facet of your life, taxing and tracking everything you do.
[00:50:40.521 --> 00:50:44.547]  We'll come back and hit some news on that and wrap up this transmission.
[00:50:44.607 --> 00:50:45.188]  Stay the course.
[00:50:45.369 --> 00:50:48.293]  And as I said, I covered so much key information.
[00:50:49.395 --> 00:51:06.733]  In the first hour on the whole esoteric agenda and this new connection to the first Matrix movie to 9-11 so that'll be covered during the rebroadcast you want to find out what happened there when the show is over in t-minus exactly nine minutes and one second from now
[00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.321]  The pressures of everyday life can deliver a serious blow to your health.
[00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:18.003]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers, depression, and insomnia.
[00:51:18.203 --> 00:51:21.184]  Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.

[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:36.864]  The private banking families that own and dominate our planet to a great extent created communism to con the serfs back into slavery.
[00:54:38.405 --> 00:54:39.885]  It's all declassified, all public.
[00:54:39.925 --> 00:54:41.846]  Put Mao in, Lenin, Stalin, all of it.
[00:54:43.707 --> 00:54:50.069]  Now they need a new way to con people into giving up control of their land, what they do, taxing the air we breathe.
[00:54:50.729 --> 00:54:51.890]  One of the four life-giving
[00:54:53.479 --> 00:54:54.720]  Things that are needed on this planet.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:55:01.748]  Water, sunlight, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.
[00:55:01.768 --> 00:55:06.754]  And they're going to put on the side of your car, on the sticker, in California, what its carbon footprint is.
[00:55:06.774 --> 00:55:10.738]  They're starting to put it on products, shaming you for your great crime you've committed.
[00:55:11.019 --> 00:55:13.842]  Meanwhile, thousands of true environmental things are going on that are horrible.
[00:55:14.022 --> 00:55:14.583]  Doesn't matter.
[00:55:16.826 --> 00:55:18.427]  Japan's doing it, AP reports.
[00:55:19.167 --> 00:55:21.848]  Japan, this is AFP, excuse me, Agency French Press.
[00:55:22.228 --> 00:55:25.829]  Japan to label goods, carbon footprint officials say.
[00:55:26.469 --> 00:55:34.372]  Japan is planning to label consumer goods to show their carbon footprint in a bid to raise public awareness about global warming, an official said Tuesday.
[00:55:35.612 --> 00:55:44.575]  Under the plan, a select range of products from beverages to detergent will carry markings on the carbon footprint of how much gas responsible for global warming has emitted through production and delivery.
[00:55:46.002 --> 00:56:02.598]  and it is so this is you gotta label something before you start taxing it and they're gonna have your carbon credit cards all the announced globally through your nation that will you'll pay taxes on when you go over that carbon allotment so just absolutely amazing there are also
[00:56:03.815 --> 00:56:07.017]  Arctic ice grows 30% in a year, another Paul Watson article.
[00:56:07.737 --> 00:56:11.079]  Predictions of ice-free summer for the first time in history completely debunked.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:23.007]  Alarmist scientists who predicted that North America could be ice-free this summer as a result of global warming have been embarrassed after it was revealed that Arctic ice has actually grown by around 30% in the year since 2007.
[00:56:23.407 --> 00:56:28.150]  Back in June, numerous prominent voices in the scientific community expressed fears of mass melting of the polar ice caps.
[00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:31.771]  They show the ignorant public ice flows, and they think that's it breaking up.
[00:56:31.811 --> 00:56:32.751]  It always does it every summer.
[00:56:33.131 --> 00:56:41.112]  Including David Barber, the University of Manitoba, who told National Geographic Magazine, we're actually projecting this year that the North Pole may be free of ice for the first time in history.
[00:56:41.613 --> 00:56:48.294]  Then it goes on with the satellite photos and all the documents that it's actually gotten 30% bigger, growing at record rates.
[00:56:48.594 --> 00:56:53.435]  See, people don't know that it rains on top of the glaciers and on top of the Arctic and Antarctic.
[00:56:54.315 --> 00:57:00.797]  The North and South and that they get bigger and then the weight of the mountains it pushes out and then sloughs off and breaks off.
