[00:00:05.968 --> 00:00:06.628]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:08.349]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.130]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.611]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:14.272]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:17.634]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:22.216]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:30.119]  Do you know when I blow up, when I get angry?
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.920]  When I do?
[00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:36.358]  Two, three hours on radio and basically start screaming every other sentence.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.463]  It's when I get frustrated when I get angry.
[00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:43.708]  Really, it's a form of laziness.
[00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:49.996]  I'll have all these stacks of horrible news, global government advancing, the proof of everything.
[00:00:50.916 --> 00:01:01.902]  And I would have spent hours and hours and hours studying it, and then I get on air, and I just don't want to properly articulate it, and so I just start hyperventilating and getting angry.
[00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:10.967]  I am going to attempt today to not do that, and to calmly go over as much of the news as I can.
[00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:19.211]  We have no guests today, because I want plenty of time to go over all this news, all the different things that are developing on the geopolitical strata on a planetary scale.
[00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.327]  We're also going to have open phones after the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:25.248]  We'll give the number out.
[00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:26.529]  Phones aren't open yet, though.
[00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.351]  Let me just give you the news I've got here in front of me.
[00:01:30.932 --> 00:01:35.015]  Middle class may be subject to food rations, warns UN.
[00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:45.062]  Now, Paul Watson did a detailed article nexusing and in with the different martial law provisions, but here's the Financial Times of London headline.
[00:01:45.742 --> 00:01:47.684]  High food prices may force
[00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:51.876]  Aid rationing, and they go on at the U.N.
[00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:54.899]  to say the middle class may even go under food rationing.
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.082]  Vaccinating boys for girls' sake.
[00:01:59.843 --> 00:02:03.066]  This is out of the New York Times today.
[00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:06.168]  Pushing the deadly Gardasil.
[00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.472]  And, you know, when I see a headline like that, I feel cornered.
[00:02:11.295 --> 00:02:13.296]  I know it doesn't protect you from HPV.
[00:02:13.856 --> 00:02:17.117]  I know HPV only kills about 9,000 people a year.
[00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:20.798]  Sounds big, but it's nothing on the scale of other cancers.
[00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:29.680]  The vaccine, if you already have the virus, which about half the public has, actually gives you a 44% increase in getting that cancer.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.981]  So it actually will make people get cancer if they don't care.
[00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:37.182]  And it's killed a bunch of people and maimed a bunch of others as well.
[00:02:38.142 --> 00:02:39.423]  It's a live virus.
[00:02:39.823 --> 00:02:40.403]  Very deadly.
[00:02:41.443 --> 00:02:42.083]  And I know that.
[00:02:42.183 --> 00:02:48.326]  I know it's also a fraud, but there's no law that you have to take it, and Governor Perry's a liar, and the media's engaged in a huge hoax.
[00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:49.886]  You can verify that in about ten seconds.
[00:02:51.667 --> 00:03:02.351]  But still, women everywhere are lining up and injecting their daughters and injecting themselves, and they're taking these beautiful, happy women that would have these great lives ahead of them, and just absolutely frying them.
[00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:13.614]  Okay, Chris Gold says he'd recommend the politics of fear and fear-mongering on Fox News.
[00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:15.556]  So we'll play that.
[00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:21.680]  Also, Comedian Lee Camp tells Fox News is a festival of ignorance on Fox News, and they cut the transmission off.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.621]  Those are coming up.
[00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:34.470]  Medals and gold edge up towards record peaks of $9.50, so it's basically staying right up at $9.40, $9.50, just unbelievable, on fears of
[00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.890]  Record inflation and global instability.
[00:03:38.811 --> 00:03:39.971]  Platinum bounces back.
[00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:41.472]  Gold up on strong oil.
[00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:42.812]  We'll go over that.
[00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:48.095]  EU pulls out of northern Kosovo to disturb resistance.
[00:03:48.135 --> 00:03:50.836]  They're burning the police stations and everything else.
[00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:51.677]  The cops are running.
[00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:55.759]  Which will happen immediately if the American people ever decide to fight back physically.
[00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.280]  I'm not saying that's what needs to happen, though.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.801]  And I'm going to tie this together today.
[00:04:01.997 --> 00:04:02.277]  U.S.
[00:04:02.317 --> 00:04:04.198]  imperialism behind Kosovo's split.
[00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:04.958]  Press TV.
[00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:06.239]  That's absolutely true.
[00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.280]  Feds consider easing ban on guns in parks.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.840]  Some good news, actually.
[00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:13.041]  The new plagues.
[00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:17.643]  Why superbugs, TB, leprosy, and other pestilences are invading the U.S.
[00:04:18.143 --> 00:04:19.523]  Give you the actual federal numbers.
[00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:23.965]  Biodiversity doomsday vault comes to life in the Arctic.
[00:04:24.825 --> 00:04:26.366]  This out of the French news agency.
[00:04:26.406 --> 00:04:27.506]  Why have the elite built this?
[00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:30.247]  Obama accuser fails polygraph.
[00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.682]  That is just some of what's coming up.
[00:04:35.702 --> 00:04:40.787]  And of course, the really big news, North American Army created without okay by U.S.
[00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:41.307]  Congress.
[00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.370]  Road to Tyranny shows you the actual documents.
[00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:46.712]  Masses of Terror details it.
[00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:48.433]  That was six years ago.
[00:04:48.974 --> 00:04:49.794]  I made those films.
[00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:54.619]  But now, uh, now the mainstream media can break it for you.
[00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.280]  Tell you how great it is.
[00:04:57.141 --> 00:04:58.001]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.041 --> 00:04:59.543]  It's totally jam-packed show.
[00:04:59.803 --> 00:05:00.704]  Strap yourselves in.

[00:05:57.884 --> 00:06:00.505]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:12.809]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:16.092]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:06:16.672 --> 00:06:19.075]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:27.342]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:35.150]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.093]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.493 --> 00:06:41.975]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:06:42.055 --> 00:06:43.195]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:43.996]  They're not after money.
[00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:45.057]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:46.017]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.257 --> 00:06:47.298]  That's what they're after.
[00:06:47.418 --> 00:06:51.961]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:55.644]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.924 --> 00:06:56.604]  Endgame.
[00:06:56.905 --> 00:06:58.566]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.926 --> 00:07:00.087]  You have been warned.
[00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:01.509]  It's a fact.
[00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:09.219]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.708]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all loans.
[00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:16.349]  We're good to go.
[00:07:35.547 --> 00:07:40.569]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:45.231]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:47.191]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:47.431]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:47.932]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:07:48.052 --> 00:07:49.912]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:07:49.972 --> 00:07:50.552]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.993]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.593 --> 00:08:14.336]  Unfortunately, I am often imitated but never duplicated.
[00:08:14.356 --> 00:08:22.679]  I say unfortunately because if I'm the best we've got to fight against the New World Order, I don't have to tell you we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.921]  I don't have any high and mighty views of myself.
[00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:45.105]  In fact, I am frustrated every day that I can study in a calm, cool capacity to two, three o'clock in the morning, like I did last night, and just have incredible knowledge and grasp of the enemy program, and then try to get up here on air and articulate it.
[00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:53.350]  It's words, you know, can't even express how mechanized and focused and evil our enemies are.
[00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:58.043]  Also, I want to talk about the nature of the psychopathic mind.
[00:08:58.123 --> 00:09:14.096]  People think that psychopaths rule our society, and they're certainly a very large and important contingent of the overall makeup in the hierarchical, vertical, integrated society, but they're actually a minority of the ruling power elite.
[00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:23.284]  We face some individuals far worse than just your classical psychopath that has an overlaid, sadistic power complex.
[00:09:26.954 --> 00:09:41.758]  Oh, by the way, you couldn't post comments on InfoWars.com yesterday, because we started getting 400, 500, 600 comments per story, and it's had some problems the last few weeks.
[00:09:41.838 --> 00:09:43.558]  It's up about 95% of the time.
[00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:45.258]  It went down yesterday.
[00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:46.659]  Not the site, but the messages.
[00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:51.780]  But we're learning and tweaking and dealing with this as the site becomes a mega-site.
[00:09:54.048 --> 00:10:01.055]  As the site approaches the size of WorldNetDaily alone, InfoWars is approaching the size of WorldNetDaily globally.
[00:10:01.655 --> 00:10:04.077]  Prison Planet, of course, is approaching the size.
[00:10:04.678 --> 00:10:17.590]  Those twins together dwarf FreeRepublic, WorldNetDaily, the twin titans of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that are continually being expanded
[00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:19.205]  We're good to go.
[00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:48.267]  Infowars.com is really exploding.
[00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:56.615]  Just the message board format, the commenting on the stories is just to the moon without a rocket as they say.
[00:10:56.635 --> 00:11:01.019]  As Ralph Cramden would say in The Honeymooners.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.225]  So I hope that you haven't gone in there in the message board and the comment on the stories.
[00:11:08.326 --> 00:11:09.747]  I would hope that you would take advantage of that.
[00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:11.549]  It just went back up in the last 30 minutes.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.664]  Also, I haven't really plugged this enough, and it's got, I don't know, 4,000 members or something now.
[00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:20.646]  That is the InfoWars Network.
[00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:25.490]  Have your own MySpace page, post your own videos, your own audios, write your own stories.
[00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:33.656]  Use that as your base of operations for free, you know, to build your own mini-website and get it linked on other message boards and other sites.
[00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:40.648]  I hope you'll take advantage of the InfoWars.com network.
[00:11:40.688 --> 00:11:42.829]  Just go to InfoWars.com itself and link through.
[00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:51.273]  Then of course there's good old PrisonPlanet.com with the PrisonPlanet.com forums with hundreds of thousands of people that have gone there and posted things.
[00:11:52.414 --> 00:11:56.276]  Just incredible debates, incredible articles and stories that have been written.
[00:11:57.128 --> 00:12:04.914]  By some of the contributors there, who I would hope would submit those to Paul Watson or Curt Nemo for posting as stories.
[00:12:05.294 --> 00:12:07.515]  There's just so much of it, I can't even read it all.
[00:12:08.516 --> 00:12:17.823]  The intellect, the research, the... But all of it is complex thoughts, complex document postings.
[00:12:18.503 --> 00:12:22.326]  I might spend 30 minutes an hour reading just one page one of our listeners has put up.
[00:12:23.297 --> 00:12:30.339]  Now, these are professors and doctorates, or it might be an auto mechanic who's got an understanding of what's happening, and making incredible points.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.220]  And again, I'm frustrated.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.861]  As a limited intellect, I can't cover it all or deal with it all.
[00:12:40.282 --> 00:12:50.985]  But you can go in there in this college of discussion, in this society of people that want liberty and freedom, truthers, whatever you want to call us, the resistance,
[00:12:52.355 --> 00:13:03.018]  Pre-humanity, just to be at the heart of all of this as it grows and expands is actually a very humbling experience.
[00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:05.878]  And I just want you to know that.
[00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:12.300]  I saw a YouTube video of this guy making fun of me this morning, and I thought it was really funny actually.
[00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.260]  I forgot to IM that to you.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.201]  John, maybe I'll dig that out and send it to you.
[00:13:17.221 --> 00:13:17.721]  We'll play it.
[00:13:18.755 --> 00:13:22.276]  You know, he starts out playing my intro music and going, AHH!
[00:13:23.296 --> 00:13:23.436]  AHH!
[00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:25.636]  Do you know what that is when I do that?
[00:13:26.816 --> 00:13:28.897]  That's kind of like a steam valve.
[00:13:29.437 --> 00:13:35.198]  Because in the past I would just go into a total screaming rant, and now I'll just kind of go, AHH!
[00:13:35.298 --> 00:13:36.778]  And then I'll go back on track.
[00:13:39.338 --> 00:13:40.359]  Because I'm frustrated.
[00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.339]  I feel impotent.
[00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:48.460]  In many levels I feel powerful, aggressive, successful, but overall I feel impotent through the public's
[00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:49.769]  Weakness.
[00:13:50.769 --> 00:13:58.271]  I mean, I know that the Gardasil vaccines are killing our girls, maiming them.
[00:13:59.071 --> 00:14:00.411]  I know it's a live virus.
[00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:09.993]  I know it's causing all sorts of autoimmune diseases, people being paralyzed, dying, blood coming out of every orifice is one of the common things that happens.
[00:14:10.614 --> 00:14:12.374]  I mean, just thousands of bloody sores.
[00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:28.451]  When I showed Endgame 10 times here in Austin last year, a lot of people came who'd never been to one of my events who didn't know who I was.
[00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:37.255]  A lot of women brought their boyfriends, a lot of boyfriends brought their girlfriends, and there would be women who'd never heard of me, and I would say, well when you take the tetanus shot,
[00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:41.448]  In the third world, they've been caught, and there's evidence they do it here in the U.S.
[00:14:41.468 --> 00:14:53.911]  They add a pathogen to it, so there's an autoimmunity to that, and the body attacks the different glands that secrete these hormones, and it basically sterilizes you, and you have bad autoimmune responses.
[00:14:53.951 --> 00:14:57.591]  And, you know, four women raise their hands and freak out and say, how did you know that?
[00:14:57.631 --> 00:14:58.492]  That happened to me.
[00:14:58.992 --> 00:14:59.632]  Oh my God!
[00:15:01.727 --> 00:15:02.967]  You know, I thought you were full of it.
[00:15:03.007 --> 00:15:03.848]  How did you know that?
[00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:04.588]  That happened to me.
[00:15:04.628 --> 00:15:08.349]  And then, you know, one of the women came on the show, showed her photos, her medical documents.
[00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.350]  They gave her a shot and almost killed her.
[00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:13.971]  How do I know?
[00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:14.512]  The U.N.
[00:15:14.532 --> 00:15:16.052]  got caught, okay?
[00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:27.956]  You know, I told a story on the radio last night about how I walked out of P.F.
[00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:29.137]  Chang's like a year ago.
[00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:31.107]  We're good to go.
[00:15:57.617 --> 00:16:07.181]  I said, they've changed the name now, but I said, I want you, when you get home tonight, to Google, it's in the mainstream news, London Telegraph, French News Agency, BBC, that they kidnapped...
[00:16:08.084 --> 00:16:12.606]  In a one-year period, we're involved in the kidnapping of 1.2 million women and children.
[00:16:12.946 --> 00:16:14.407]  They send them to slave brothels.
[00:16:15.247 --> 00:16:17.168]  They're connected into snuff films.
[00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:22.430]  But the majority just go to textile plants on islands where they've built factories.
[00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.592]  And they send the men to bricklaying facilities where they actually are physical slaves.
[00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:28.373]  And the cops just start laughing at me.
[00:16:28.993 --> 00:16:30.434]  One of them knew who I was, so they're laughing.
[00:16:30.534 --> 00:16:33.135]  Oh, sure, Jones and the aliens are going to get me.
[00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:35.596]  They go, look, we work in that building sometimes.
[00:16:37.882 --> 00:16:40.963]  And I just said, listen, it's true, please Google it.
[00:16:41.764 --> 00:16:42.764]  And they just laughed at me.
[00:16:44.365 --> 00:16:46.606]  And that's why we're in so much trouble, folks.
[00:16:48.327 --> 00:16:58.571]  Because what I said was true, and those cops should know that I can't go on the radio and AM and FM stations all over the country and say that DynCorp's doing that if it isn't true.
[00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:06.415]  Because I know you'll never check out what I'm saying, but would you at least think about that?
[00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:09.980]  You see, I got chills right now all over me.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.941]  I'm freaked out.
[00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:18.368]  I can't enjoy anything in my life anymore, because all I think about is how evil these people are, and how they've got to be stopped, and how you're a bunch of clowns.
[00:17:18.988 --> 00:17:20.370]  How you think it's real funny!
[00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:29.018]  It isn't funny that CPS in Florida took more than 3,000 children, and won't say where they are, and a bunch of them have been found overseas or dead.
[00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:32.119]  That's been in the Florida papers!
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.961]  But they report it like it's no big deal!
[00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:37.184]  Like they're talking about the cost of ham sandwiches or something!
[00:17:37.624 --> 00:17:38.805]  These aren't ham sandwiches!
[00:17:39.046 --> 00:17:39.846]  These are children!
[00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.909]  The government isn't fit to do anything!
[00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:50.376]  It's run by a bunch of incompetents at the bottom, who don't know their head from a hole in the ground, and a bunch of sociopathic technocrats at the top!
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:55.941]  And I think about how
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.345]  Merck Pharmaceutical knew that Vioxx caused heart problems, but they spent millions making the drugs.
[00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:05.985]  They put it out.
[00:18:06.446 --> 00:18:08.387]  Hundreds of thousands died of heart attacks from it.
[00:18:08.748 --> 00:18:09.868]  And you just forget about it.
[00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.752]  They're one of the most evil drug companies out there, but they're all bad.
[00:18:18.415 --> 00:18:20.057]  I'm not saying they don't even have some good drugs.
[00:18:20.077 --> 00:18:21.518]  I'm saying people running it are evil.
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.341]  And it's the same thing.
[00:18:28.559 --> 00:18:32.461]  It's the same thing with Gardasil put out by Merck Pharmaceutical.
[00:18:37.264 --> 00:18:39.866]  They knew they had something that was going to kill and maim women.
[00:18:42.508 --> 00:18:43.508]  Bare minimum, they know it.
[00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:47.831]  And so they went to a governor and had him, quote, mandate it.
[00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:54.835]  As soon as that, as soon as the governor mandates, federal funds kick in and the feds pay for any lawsuits and liability.
[00:18:55.055 --> 00:18:57.417]  So they dumped a bad drug.
[00:18:58.001 --> 00:19:06.666]  A bad, live vaccine on the market, and they know it's killing all these people and making them sick, and they don't care.
[00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:09.747]  Now, we can call it a bad drug.
[00:19:09.787 --> 00:19:10.848]  I don't even think it's a bad drug.
[00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:13.489]  Bad drug means that's not what it's meant to do.
[00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.870]  No, that's what it's meant to do.
[00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:25.716]  They are practicing right now, being able to put something out that kills and maims, something that doesn't even protect you, if you don't have the virus, and that gives you a 44% chance of getting the cervical cancer,
[00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:30.574]  If you happen to already be infected with it, it's about half the population is.
[00:19:34.536 --> 00:19:39.620]  So, see, it's not a bad drug, because from their perspective, it's like Bayer Pharmaceutical.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:45.484]  Hundreds of thousands conservatively died when they knew all their factor VIII drug had AIDS in every single shot.
[00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:46.304]  HIV.
[00:19:47.305 --> 00:19:48.186]  Was it bad?
[00:19:48.946 --> 00:19:49.647]  No, it wasn't bad.
[00:19:49.687 --> 00:19:50.507]  They meant to do that.
[00:19:52.008 --> 00:19:52.208]  See?
[00:19:52.228 --> 00:19:55.711]  Alright, we'll come back and get into all the foreign proof.
[00:19:55.791 --> 00:19:56.131]  It's just...
[00:19:57.182 --> 00:20:00.523]  That's why I'm freaked out, is that they're practicing evil, they're testing it.
[00:20:02.904 --> 00:20:04.964]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:14.527]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.987 --> 00:20:22.169]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.893 --> 00:20:28.379]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die, with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:39.710]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size, without adverse side effects, at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.451 --> 00:20:42.533]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:51.082 --> 00:20:55.543]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:55.943 --> 00:20:57.463]  A new world order.
[00:20:57.523 --> 00:21:07.386]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:13.047]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:21:13.367 --> 00:21:16.367]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[00:21:16.907 --> 00:21:19.328]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:20.089 --> 00:21:27.513]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.435 --> 00:21:35.398]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.898 --> 00:21:39.359]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:42.280]  Builderburg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.481]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:44.261]  They're not after money.
[00:21:44.281 --> 00:21:45.341]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:46.361]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.542 --> 00:21:47.542]  That's what they're after.

[00:23:58.591 --> 00:24:05.554]  Welcome back.
[00:24:06.314 --> 00:24:08.455]  I mean, here's the London Guardian today.
[00:24:08.475 --> 00:24:12.516]  New evidence challenges official picture of Kennedy shooting.
[00:24:13.937 --> 00:24:17.918]  London Guardian comes right out and just says the government killed him and gives the evidence.
[00:24:18.758 --> 00:24:23.040]  We always had the Los Angeles coroner saying he had all the bullet holes in his back.
[00:24:23.846 --> 00:24:26.188]  From point-blank range, as all the witnesses said.
[00:24:26.848 --> 00:24:35.894]  They had known mental patient drugged out, being handled by known CIA agents, literally stumbling around on amnesia drugs, and they just said, you killed him, and he said, okay.
[00:24:36.394 --> 00:24:38.195]  Sirhan Sirhan, it's always the same.
[00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:47.681]  And now they've released new photos, they've released new audio tapes showing there were more shots fired, and that it wasn't the revolver that Sirhan Sirhan had.
[00:24:48.042 --> 00:24:51.664]  Everything we already told you, it's now the biggest paper in Europe and England.
[00:24:52.104 --> 00:24:53.065]  It is the largest paper.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.961]  It's like the USA Today of Europe and England, and they just say the government killed him.
[00:24:58.301 --> 00:24:59.522]  Oh, there you go.
[00:25:02.523 --> 00:25:11.966]  Listen, I know it's hard for you driving along in your car in Kansas City, or Niagara Falls, or Tampa, Florida, or Austin, Texas, listening on 1330 AM.
[00:25:12.746 --> 00:25:20.108]  I know it's hard for you to believe that DynCorp kidnaps little children.
[00:25:21.229 --> 00:25:21.669]  But they do.
[00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:27.923]  Hey, imagine what it's like fighting them and putting their name out on air and getting death threats over it.
[00:25:30.225 --> 00:25:31.406]  You know what that's like?
[00:25:33.128 --> 00:25:35.010]  I'm sorry the real world is this way.
[00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.730]  I'm sorry!
[00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.994]  Yeah, I'm always bashing, quote, yuppies, and that's an oversimplification.
[00:25:39.434 --> 00:25:46.461]  I mean, know-it-all people that think they're members of the elite who just giggle and laugh at everything that's going on serious.
[00:25:48.391 --> 00:25:53.794]  It's serious when they can kill a president and his brother in front of everybody and tell us lies.
[00:25:54.134 --> 00:26:05.099]  It's serious when the voting machines are compromised and people have gone to prison and people have blown the whistle who work in the companies and it's come out that the government is stealing the elections.
[00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:10.762]  All of this is serious.
[00:26:10.862 --> 00:26:12.923]  It's serious when they're devaluing our dollar.
[00:26:13.223 --> 00:26:15.264]  It's serious when they're getting rid of our currency.
[00:26:16.607 --> 00:26:27.571]  You know, the old-timers, 30, 40 years ago, were saying, they plan to merge us with Canada and Mexico, and slowly merge our military and our police with cross-training, and then finally they're going to sign deals that it's for insurrection.
[00:26:29.712 --> 00:26:45.879]  I remember Bernardine Smith sent me, 12 years ago, a big folder of the actual, somewhere in a storage building around here, we've got three storage buildings, of original New York Times and Washington Post articles where it said, they're going to take our guns, they're going to have 10 FEMA regents, this is in the 60s.
[00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:49.847]  They're going to have Canadian troops in the U.S., U.S.
[00:26:49.887 --> 00:26:52.990]  troops in Canada, Mexican troops in the U.S., U.S.
[00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.592]  troops in Mexico, NAFTA highways.
[00:26:58.414 --> 00:27:01.497]  I've got to dig that out and scan those and get them online.
[00:27:03.859 --> 00:27:12.326]  And my film, Road to Tyranny, shows mainstream news saying signed deals use Mexican-Canadian troops during emergencies in the U.S.
[00:27:12.346 --> 00:27:13.367]  in order to fight terrorists.
[00:27:14.986 --> 00:27:17.087]  Then we have Government Documents and Masters of Terror.
[00:27:17.347 --> 00:27:27.391]  I've been to the Urban Warfare events, and I've actually been out at police checkpoints before and had the cops walk by and joke, Are the foreign troops gonna get me?
[00:27:28.052 --> 00:27:29.412]  Oh, Alex!
[00:27:30.253 --> 00:27:41.418]  Well, I've got Com Ken West, one of the biggest media owned by Conrad Black, the big neocon, saying how great it is that Canadian troops will be used in the U.S.
[00:27:41.438 --> 00:27:42.138]  to quell dissent.
[00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:47.596]  They do say the public's a little upset because this was kept secret from them, but it's now been leaked.
[00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:49.356]  Okay, gotta keep it secret, too.
[00:27:52.217 --> 00:27:56.138]  So, see, now they've announced it, it'll be okay, foreign troops are good.
[00:27:58.178 --> 00:28:00.278]  And I don't want to hear support our military anymore.
[00:28:01.339 --> 00:28:05.580]  Our military is more and more being made up of aggravated felons and illegal aliens.
[00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:12.581]  The biggest recruiting centers are in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Mexico, the Philippines,
[00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:14.565]  Georgia?
[00:28:16.926 --> 00:28:17.546]  Ukraine?
[00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:23.468]  You can't make this stuff up!
[00:28:24.528 --> 00:28:25.708]  It's too incredible!
[00:28:28.649 --> 00:28:32.590]  And so now, it's mainstream news.
[00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.411]  Now, it's right out in the open.
[00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:39.552]  Now, it's not even being debated.
[00:28:39.832 --> 00:28:42.633]  They're just, oh yeah, there's a secret deal for our militaries.
[00:28:43.294 --> 00:28:43.934]  to merge.
[00:28:45.295 --> 00:28:46.775]  It's not a big deal.
[00:28:47.415 --> 00:28:50.416]  Everybody should just get ready for it and accept it.
[00:28:50.436 --> 00:29:05.080]  I'm going to read the Ken West article where they admit it, but over the weekend, Paul Watson wrote a great story about it and tied it into all the background, but Dr. Coursey's done a story on this.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.861]  North American Army created without okay by Congress, U.S.
[00:29:08.901 --> 00:29:09.841]  Canada Military Inc.
[00:29:09.861 --> 00:29:11.842]  deal to fight domestic emergencies.
[00:29:16.252 --> 00:29:24.459]  But then you go read the SPP documents, the Judicial Watch sued to get from September 20th through 23rd in Banff, Canada.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.781]  It's in, by the way, in-game.
[00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:33.407]  And it says, we've got to keep this secret, but we're merging our militaries to fight emergencies and to fight terrorists.
[00:29:37.211 --> 00:29:41.554]  North American Army created, without okay of Congress, U.S.-Canada Military, Inc.
[00:29:41.574 --> 00:29:43.136]  deal to fight domestic emergencies.
[00:29:44.096 --> 00:29:45.638]  We're gonna come back and cover all this.
[00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:47.840]  I'm gonna get into a bunch of other news and take your calls.
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.501]  1-800-259-9931.
[00:29:51.864 --> 00:29:52.765]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.245 --> 00:29:54.847]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.788 --> 00:29:58.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.613 --> 00:30:10.022]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.

[00:30:26.818 --> 00:30:29.039]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.550]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:08.372]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:31:08.852 --> 00:31:13.353]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened,
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.100]  I think so.
[00:31:31.836 --> 00:31:32.456]  We're good.
[00:32:00.689 --> 00:32:03.611]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:32:03.771 --> 00:32:08.995]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:14.599]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:16.140]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:25.386]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:32:25.806 --> 00:32:27.428]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:31.832]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:33:18.273 --> 00:33:19.234]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:23.055 --> 00:33:24.015]  Look at this headline.
[00:33:24.596 --> 00:33:25.716]  Canada, U.S.
[00:33:25.816 --> 00:33:30.478]  agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies.
[00:33:31.618 --> 00:33:34.819]  This is out of Canwest News Service.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.621]  The equivalent of the Associated Press in Canada.
[00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:44.443]  Published in hundreds of newspapers daily in Canada.
[00:33:44.503 --> 00:33:45.483]  They just come right out
[00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:52.015]  Now, that means foreign troops will be used in the U.S.
[00:33:52.116 --> 00:34:12.994]  and I have read the now declassified agreement from February 14th that just expanded more than a decade of secret agreements that we've had to sue to get, the Patriot Movement, and it says to fight crime, to fight terror during natural disasters,
[00:34:15.236 --> 00:34:24.580]  Foreign troops just calmly announcing it, and the average know-it-all trendy out there probably doesn't know what that means.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.601]  But in history, let me give you a cube.
[00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:37.445]  The Russians would use soldiers from one of their republics, one of their holdings, to go suppress people 2,000 miles away in another region.
[00:34:38.795 --> 00:34:49.723]  Because they're culturally different, they're from different areas, they are many times more likely to fire on you, to take you to camps, to follow orders.
[00:34:51.985 --> 00:34:57.209]  Remember on 9-11 when they had Norwegian and German and British AWACS over our cities?
[00:34:57.789 --> 00:34:58.610]  And F-16s?
[00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:00.311]  Quote, helping us.
[00:35:00.611 --> 00:35:04.474]  Remember the Mexican troops since the first time, since the Spanish-American War?
[00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:07.677]  Pouring across
[00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:23.342]  They're in Katrina, in Dallas, in San Antonio, in Houston, in New Orleans, and they were serving the food to the regular army troops that were going and confiscating the guns.
[00:35:23.382 --> 00:35:24.563]  They were there in a support role.
[00:35:25.883 --> 00:35:39.487]  And in the Washington Post, in other publications, they'd put blurbs out, just to acclimate you and condition you how great it was, in 2002, that quote, Mexican and Canadian troops would be used under a new NORTHCOM agreement
[00:35:40.845 --> 00:35:46.067]  To deal with natural disasters and to fight American terrorists.
[00:35:46.827 --> 00:35:52.790]  And now Chertoff says the main focus is domestic terrorists, and that he feels that they're going to strike any minute.
[00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.371]  And they told you, Fox News has told you, blonde-haired, blue-eyed al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:58.852]  So now they're scripting it.
[00:35:59.841 --> 00:36:08.628]  They're casting it that it isn't just those evil Muslims you've got to watch that are under every picnic table wanting to drink your blood.
[00:36:09.288 --> 00:36:11.310]  No, it's everyone.
[00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:19.916]  And they say in the FBI manuals, pregnant women, priests, don't trust anyone, only the government.
[00:36:21.677 --> 00:36:25.440]  This whole tattletale society, while the border stays wide open, it's all a fraud.
[00:36:29.193 --> 00:36:38.021]  InfraGard, 23,000 executives trained secretly with the FBI to help bring in martial law, help bring in civil emergency, help bring in control.
[00:36:38.501 --> 00:36:40.963]  To spy on their neighbors, spy on their colleagues.
[00:36:40.983 --> 00:36:44.807]  26,000 preachers as of last year.
[00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:48.204]  And I got news articles today.
[00:36:48.524 --> 00:36:53.646]  Tim walked up and gave me some mainstream news where, oh, the church is having a disaster drill training with the feds.
[00:36:54.006 --> 00:36:59.887]  Then you read deeper, you find out, you get there and they say, now submit to the government, turn your guns in when the time comes.
[00:37:03.568 --> 00:37:05.588]  And they signed secret agreements with the feds.
[00:37:05.988 --> 00:37:09.109]  Oh, just the feds running around signing secret agreements, building camps everywhere.
[00:37:11.517 --> 00:37:16.000]  But Canadian troops... Now, now, now, if I was the Canadians, I'd be more worried about the Americans.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.442]  That's the plan, according to documents back to the sixties, is to use the U.S.
[00:37:19.462 --> 00:37:20.502]  to suppress the Canadians.
[00:37:22.744 --> 00:37:25.925]  The Canadians are going to hook up with the Dutch and the Germans and others.
[00:37:26.426 --> 00:37:32.889]  They even have it back to the fifties broken up, and they still work according to these combat training groups and these exchange programs.
[00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.711]  They have certain troops for certain areas of the country.
[00:37:36.372 --> 00:37:40.474]  Chinese for the west coast, Chinese military, and
[00:37:41.278 --> 00:37:45.942]  British and Dutch and German for the East Coast and Czech Republic.
[00:37:48.885 --> 00:37:50.146]  That's now an agreement in the 80s.
[00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:51.007]  That's one of the later ones.
[00:37:51.407 --> 00:37:54.170]  It's for Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas.
[00:37:56.452 --> 00:37:58.593]  And then, lo and behold, they have an urban warfare drill.
[00:37:59.815 --> 00:38:00.996]  You can pull up and it'll be
[00:38:02.248 --> 00:38:07.651]  Czech Republic with our troops right here in Texas training to put us in camps and take our guns.
[00:38:07.691 --> 00:38:10.652]  I mean, I don't just read it and stuff from the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[00:38:11.073 --> 00:38:13.634]  I can then go out to a drill and oh, here it is exactly.
[00:38:15.433 --> 00:38:23.039]  And so I'll bring up things that have been declassified or leaked decades ago as part of other projects, because the government has different programs.
[00:38:23.059 --> 00:38:27.022]  Well, they'll try to announce it, then if you don't buy into it, they'll then make it secret and keep building.
[00:38:27.482 --> 00:38:28.663]  And I'll throw stuff out at troops.
[00:38:28.683 --> 00:38:31.685]  You see this in the police tape films, and they'll say, how do you know that?
[00:38:31.765 --> 00:38:32.666]  That's classified.
[00:38:33.206 --> 00:38:37.790]  It's classified to you, Jack, but we reverse engineered it.
[00:38:41.204 --> 00:38:45.485]  It's a great feeling of power to talk about how you're going to machine gun us and put us in camps.
[00:38:46.746 --> 00:38:47.026]  Isn't it?
[00:38:50.647 --> 00:38:51.528]  Well, the jig's up.
[00:38:51.608 --> 00:38:52.808]  We are exposing it.
[00:38:53.948 --> 00:38:55.489]  Now again, most our troops are good.
[00:38:56.649 --> 00:39:03.191]  29 Palms, 86% said they would not fire on American citizens for gun confiscation.
[00:39:04.052 --> 00:39:05.232]  But that was in 93.
[00:39:05.732 --> 00:39:08.093]  Since then, we've gotten the numbers have come out.
[00:39:08.153 --> 00:39:09.374]  Now they got about 70, 75, depending on
[00:39:11.067 --> 00:39:16.270]  The test they give them are now saying they won't fire on Americans, so they're getting about 10% more that will.
[00:39:18.112 --> 00:39:19.092]  But see, this is what happens.
[00:39:19.132 --> 00:39:23.195]  You say no on those, little prick, you get sent to Albania.
[00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:24.836]  You get sent to Kosovo.
[00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:27.157]  You get sent to Iraq.
[00:39:27.177 --> 00:39:28.658]  You get sent to Afghanistan.
[00:39:28.678 --> 00:39:30.479]  You get sent to Somalia.
[00:39:33.501 --> 00:39:35.442]  But you're that 30% that says yes.
[00:39:36.783 --> 00:39:39.085]  Well, now you're going to run a squad of Latin Americans.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.361]  Latin American felons!
[00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:43.802]  They've even brought in the old death squads.
[00:39:43.862 --> 00:39:51.246]  Remember we told you two years before it was in the news that the death squads in Latin America, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, have been brought to Iraq?
[00:39:52.007 --> 00:39:53.087]  More than 10,000 of them?
[00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:57.530]  Well now they've brought those death squads here to the U.S.
[00:39:58.731 --> 00:40:02.613]  Seneca Stillo, high-level DEA, he told you about that here on air.
[00:40:04.622 --> 00:40:09.925]  Now it's even come out in mainstream news that, oh, former death squads are now organized crime in the U.S.
[00:40:10.305 --> 00:40:13.406]  and for some reason the feds won't mess with them because they work for them.
[00:40:16.468 --> 00:40:17.848]  Death squads.
[00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.311]  And the biggest recruiting stations the U.S.
[00:40:24.331 --> 00:40:28.973]  has aren't in Boston, aren't in Dallas, aren't in New York, aren't in L.A., aren't in Detroit.
[00:40:29.714 --> 00:40:32.215]  You know where the biggest recruiting stations in the world are now?
[00:40:33.516 --> 00:40:34.716]  For at least 10 years?
[00:40:35.877 --> 00:40:36.817]  Mexico City.
[00:40:39.177 --> 00:40:40.058]  Panama City.
[00:40:40.338 --> 00:40:40.938]  Panama.
[00:40:42.378 --> 00:40:43.539]  Manila, Philippines.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.500]  And they don't follow orders.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.081]  And they don't like Americans.
[00:40:54.241 --> 00:40:56.922]  20% of the ground force a year ago, it may have grown.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.041]  Is illegal aliens that were legalized, and guess who the government looks for?
[00:41:02.101 --> 00:41:04.382]  I know I've said this before, but we need to get this message out.
[00:41:05.023 --> 00:41:07.103]  Aggravated felons!
[00:41:08.984 --> 00:41:09.844]  So let me get this straight.
[00:41:10.285 --> 00:41:18.047]  They're going to use illegal alien, aggravated felons, and foreign troops on the American people, and they're openly now announcing the deals.
[00:41:19.788 --> 00:41:23.750]  But the public was preconditioned 20, 30 years ago that nuts talk about this.
[00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.190]  You know who the nuts were that went public?
[00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.411]  Special Forces colonels.
[00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:29.405]  People in government.
[00:41:29.665 --> 00:41:36.748]  Who found out and would blow the whistle and bring out documents and people would say, ah ha ha, sure, sure it's gonna happen.
[00:41:38.088 --> 00:41:44.450]  But it isn't gonna be jumbo jet nose cones popping off and, you know, 500 troops pouring off in every city.
[00:41:46.115 --> 00:41:52.777]  And by the way, as cowardly as we are now, the cops and everybody else would run if that happened, and they'd take over the radio stations, power plants, TV stations.
[00:41:53.537 --> 00:42:01.640]  They would put a gun to the mayor, the mayor would announce, stand down to these guys, and the cops would be, within two days, lined up, following orders from foreigners.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:11.743]  I mean, I believe we're so cowardly, and so conditioned to slavery now, on average, that, I mean the general public, not the patriots, we will fight back, we're gonna be called terrorists when it happens.
[00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:19.537]  But if they went with a hot red dawn scenario, within two days, you'd have the cops already lined up, taking orders from foreigners out there on the tarmac.
[00:42:20.077 --> 00:42:22.258]  I mean, I remember seeing News 8 Austin three years ago.
[00:42:22.298 --> 00:42:23.578]  People called me and said, you gotta see this.
[00:42:23.878 --> 00:42:29.399]  And I turned it on and it said, we're sending two dozen of Austin's best police to Tokyo as part of a UN deal.
[00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:33.240]  And now the officers from Japan will be able to come here and arrest whoever they like as well.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.960]  It's part of a UN inter-policing operation.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:41.541]  So they already have the cadres of cops who even think it's normal and natural
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:48.343]  And after all, the foreign troops are just going to come in to secure international interest after the terrorists hit us.
[00:42:48.964 --> 00:42:50.005]  They're going to be helping us.
[00:42:50.025 --> 00:42:51.786]  They're going to have soup kitchens for you.
[00:42:53.427 --> 00:43:06.395]  And yes, they will have to arrest some people that weren't patriotic, but the yuppies and others, as long as it means that somebody at least promises them the economy will get better, they'll be ratting out their neighbors, their husbands, their daughters, their sons.
[00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:08.597]  Children will be tattling on their parents.
[00:43:10.512 --> 00:43:14.915]  Ah, seeing Americans grovel to foreign troops like they did in New Orleans is so pathetic.
[00:43:16.637 --> 00:43:28.525]  And again, there'll be those of us that fight, and it'll be on the newscast that we're enemy terrorists, and, oh, we're bad, and... They'll have people who've been, you know, gone two, three years, and suddenly they'll appear on news.
[00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:29.386]  Might even be me.
[00:43:29.446 --> 00:43:36.871]  I'm not saying... I can't hold up against... I mean, the torture you hear about where they... Don't let them see you're here for a couple months.
[00:43:36.952 --> 00:43:38.813]  It drives you crazy in six days on average.
[00:43:39.716 --> 00:43:41.336]  They documented that in the 70s.
[00:43:42.037 --> 00:43:43.657]  And the drugging and the electroshock.
[00:43:43.697 --> 00:43:44.997]  I mean, that's the old tech stuff.
[00:43:45.017 --> 00:43:47.018]  They got stuff now a million times worse.
[00:43:47.878 --> 00:43:54.860]  And so I have no... I mean, you may see me one day on the news saying I'm a terrorist, saying I did all these horrible things, saying I killed children.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.420]  I mean, you know.
[00:43:59.121 --> 00:43:59.981]  Because that's what they do.
[00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:02.002]  They get you and they torture you and you say whatever they want.
[00:44:05.936 --> 00:44:07.859]  So they may go with a hot Red Dawn.
[00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:10.783]  I'd say 15% chance they'll do that.
[00:44:11.063 --> 00:44:12.105]  It's certainly in the cards.
[00:44:12.165 --> 00:44:12.946]  It's one of the plans.
[00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:20.517]  They've got A, B, C, D, E, F, G. And then down the line, and I'd say it's A, B, C, or D. I'd say it's probably about D.
[00:44:21.644 --> 00:44:33.547]  But A is just keep merging the cops, you know, keep having MPs at Fiesta Texas, and you just see military out in San Antonio during festivals, giving tickets, helping cops arrest people, and you're like, why is the military out?
[00:44:33.567 --> 00:44:34.868]  Well, they're just helping shut up.
[00:44:35.128 --> 00:44:36.048]  Turn that camera off.
[00:44:36.448 --> 00:44:38.009]  We got footage of that ten years ago.
[00:44:40.129 --> 00:44:46.071]  Just keep real incrementally, quietly setting up FEMA command centers locally, merging everybody into the integrated systems.
[00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:54.655]  Sending the state police from Texas up to Canada to teach them how to do warrantless searches of people's cars?
[00:44:57.639 --> 00:44:58.900]  I remember seeing that two years ago.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.684]  Just thousands of different programs merging it all right now.
[00:45:02.704 --> 00:45:08.250]  It's all happening right now.
[00:45:11.983 --> 00:45:12.784]  Canwest.
[00:45:12.864 --> 00:45:13.865]  Canada, U.S.
[00:45:13.925 --> 00:45:16.286]  agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies.
[00:45:16.326 --> 00:45:17.127]  Canada and the U.S.
[00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:29.076]  have signed an agreement that paves the way for the militaries for either nation to send troops across each other's borders during an emergency, but some are questioning why the Harper government has kept it secret and was silent on the deal.
[00:45:29.697 --> 00:45:30.738]  Of course they kept it secret.
[00:45:31.138 --> 00:45:37.523]  Neither the Canadian government nor the Canadian forces announced the new agreement, which was signed February 14th in Texas.
[00:45:38.143 --> 00:45:38.424]  The U.S.
[00:45:38.464 --> 00:45:39.965]  military's Northern Command, however,
[00:45:40.822 --> 00:46:00.015]  Publicize the agreement with a statement outlining how its top officer, General Gene Renart, and Canadian Lieutenant General Dumas, head of the Canadian Command, signed a plan which allows the military from one nation to support the armed forces of the other nation during a civil emergency.
[00:46:00.615 --> 00:46:06.399]  The agreement which is greeted with suspicion by the left wing in Canada and the right wing in the U.S.
[00:46:06.419 --> 00:46:07.600]  So we've got to make it left or right.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.041]  No, everybody doesn't like this.
[00:46:10.433 --> 00:46:15.135]  The left-leaning Council of Canadians, which is campaigning against what it calls the increasing integration of the U.S.
[00:46:15.155 --> 00:46:18.356]  and Canada militaries, is raising concerns about the deal, and it goes on.
[00:46:23.158 --> 00:46:25.699]  You know, those extremists don't want our militaries merged.
[00:46:27.479 --> 00:46:29.820]  I was getting off into torture.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:30.961]  The primitive stuff.
[00:46:34.389 --> 00:46:36.911]  You know, my friend Eva Orner, she won the Oscar last night.
[00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:40.214]  I wasn't watching the Oscars, but Mike, here in the office, Mike Nelson called me.
[00:46:41.254 --> 00:46:45.498]  He IM'd me about 11 o'clock at night and said, oh, Eva Orner, by the way, won.
[00:46:45.638 --> 00:46:47.719]  And I went and saw Friday with Rob and Aaron.
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.682]  Taxi cab to the dark side.
[00:46:50.702 --> 00:46:59.548]  Because it's got a clip in the film of Meet the Press of Chaney going, we're working in the dark side now.
[00:46:59.589 --> 00:47:01.310]  We're using the dark side.
[00:47:02.805 --> 00:47:19.915]  And it was how they took totally innocent people, and how the real Taliban and Al-Qaeda... Well, this is all admitted, but they didn't then admit that our government created them, but they would admit the Taliban and Al-Qaeda would just go... Because a kid from the city, you go grab a kid from the city, he's going to have family, people are going to say he's innocent.
[00:47:20.476 --> 00:47:24.818]  But more than half the population of Afghanistan literally are cavemen.
[00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:31.122]  They live up in little hovels in the hills, they have a few goats, they're subsistence level, they're very frail, that's why they...
[00:47:32.992 --> 00:47:34.593]  They eat maybe one-tenth what we do.
[00:47:34.653 --> 00:47:35.233]  It's incredible.
[00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:37.255]  I've seen the studies on it.
[00:47:37.535 --> 00:47:38.656]  I've talked to troops at Robitaille.
[00:47:38.676 --> 00:47:40.337]  They just say you slap one, they fall over.
[00:47:41.838 --> 00:47:46.080]  Now, people in the city are a lot tougher because they've got more food and things, and they're taking the food.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.024]  But people are literally living like they were 2,000, 3,000 years ago in those hills.
[00:47:51.664 --> 00:47:56.327]  And the Taliban and Al Qaeda warlords would just land.
[00:47:57.448 --> 00:47:57.968]  They had U.S.
[00:47:57.988 --> 00:47:59.289]  helicopters would deliver them up there.
[00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:02.351]  They'd bring up on muleback.
[00:48:04.108 --> 00:48:10.594]  Big ol' sides of beef, something that Afghans, just incredible delicacy, you never even get it generally in your life, maybe once or twice at a wedding.
[00:48:11.635 --> 00:48:19.063]  They bring them down, and they like to grab them 11, 12, 13, because they can't defend themselves, won't know what to say once they get the camp x-ray.
[00:48:21.045 --> 00:48:25.269]  And the CIA, it turned out, this has all been in the news, knew they were totally innocent, that's who they wanted.
[00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:26.430]  So they took 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 year olds,
[00:48:29.682 --> 00:48:30.442]  By the thousands.
[00:48:30.883 --> 00:48:34.125]  The average was about 10 grand that the warlords would get per person.
[00:48:34.165 --> 00:48:35.325]  Some of them got 40 grand.
[00:48:36.386 --> 00:48:37.206]  Totally innocent.
[00:48:37.466 --> 00:48:38.487]  Don't know where the U.S.
[00:48:38.627 --> 00:48:38.807]  is.
[00:48:39.187 --> 00:48:40.028]  Never had a map.
[00:48:40.088 --> 00:48:41.329]  Never seen television.
[00:48:41.909 --> 00:48:43.170]  Literal cavemen, folks.
[00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:48.332]  Very interesting looking people, too.
[00:48:48.372 --> 00:48:51.734]  You can see the wild-eyed humanity in them.
[00:48:51.934 --> 00:48:52.875]  They're just very simple.
[00:48:54.875 --> 00:49:01.176]  Watching them in this film made me get tears in my eyes, and they just come out and they come down to have that beef, and it's over, folks.
[00:49:01.956 --> 00:49:07.217]  They're brought to these where these big, fat, demonic, I mean, literally, y'all see the jail guards talking?
[00:49:07.897 --> 00:49:11.338]  And they just beat them and beat them and beat them until their legs liquefy.
[00:49:11.378 --> 00:49:14.919]  It's all just, it's just bags of blood, and they just kill them.
[00:49:14.959 --> 00:49:15.879]  It's just, rah!
[00:49:16.659 --> 00:49:20.040]  And I mean, even this program was a complete whitewash, and I'm not bashing Eva.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.340]  I mean, it was much worse than even what they say.
[00:49:23.889 --> 00:49:28.873]  You've got the real ghost sites that all these public ones front for.
[00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:36.398]  The ghost sites, it's guys in white gurneys and glistening laboratories in the Eastern Bloc.
[00:49:37.122 --> 00:49:42.565]  You know, wires into the brains, microchips, and this has been leaked out.
[00:49:42.665 --> 00:49:45.266]  Fox News, they bragged, they stopped their hearts in these facilities.
[00:49:45.706 --> 00:49:54.650]  They put a device on your heart that's implanted, kind of like the heart plug, in the horrible redo of the book, Dune.
[00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:58.692]  I don't like the movie, but the heart plug, where they just hit a button, and then your heart stops.
[00:49:59.072 --> 00:50:00.032]  And it's like being a zombie.
[00:50:00.052 --> 00:50:00.953]  It's very terrifying.
[00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:03.294]  They just turn your heart off, and then turn it back on.
[00:50:03.554 --> 00:50:05.375]  It makes waterboarding look like nothing.
[00:50:06.753 --> 00:50:12.235]  Again, facilities glistening, guys in surgical masks working the operations.
[00:50:13.956 --> 00:50:18.278]  And of course, it's always near airfields where they're shipping out the children they kidnap out of the Eastern Bloc.
[00:50:18.878 --> 00:50:23.080]  And the doctors that like to do this sadistic stuff, they get to go have their way with children at night.
[00:50:24.081 --> 00:50:26.742]  Just pure devil pits, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:27.342 --> 00:50:31.424]  And now they're training more people, bringing them in, expanding their ops.
[00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:42.379]  But watching Taxi Cab to the Dark Side, I mean literally these demonic guards, who they interview in there, just like, of course they all had names like Damien and stuff.
[00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:44.321]  We're just like, ah, just ugh.
[00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:51.126]  Alright, I promise we're going to go to Charles and others when we get back on the other side.
[00:50:51.647 --> 00:50:54.409]  Here it is, Mainstream News, merging our militaries publicly.
[00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:55.550]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.744 --> 00:51:14.487]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:14.887 --> 00:51:21.609]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:21.969 --> 00:51:22.409]  We're good to go.
[00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:52.209]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.799 --> 00:52:03.640]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.963]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:52:09.123 --> 00:52:10.464]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:52:10.744 --> 00:52:18.928]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:52:19.128 --> 00:52:24.851]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:52:25.031 --> 00:52:26.812]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:52:26.872 --> 00:52:29.032]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:52:29.052 --> 00:52:33.414]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:52:33.594 --> 00:52:35.714]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:52:35.814 --> 00:52:43.677]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:52:43.677 --> 00:52:44.498]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.713]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:53:05.853 --> 00:53:11.078]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:53:11.259 --> 00:53:16.043]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:53:16.323 --> 00:53:27.434]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:53:27.734 --> 00:53:33.277]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:53:33.498 --> 00:53:39.581]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:40.422]  What about you?
[00:53:40.702 --> 00:53:42.603]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[00:53:42.623 --> 00:53:46.745]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[00:53:48.646 --> 00:53:49.247]  That's Jeff at 562-544-0507.
[00:53:56.431 --> 00:54:00.252]  Or simply click on the banner at GCNlive.com to order online now.
[00:54:07.213 --> 00:54:12.074]  Charles, Bobby, John, others, your calls are coming up right now.
[00:54:14.154 --> 00:54:22.416]  By the way, in 2002, in the Washington Post, CIA Section Chief of the Middle East bragged and said, well, we don't just have Camp X-Ray and Abu Ghraib,
[00:54:23.146 --> 00:54:25.166]  They had gone into Graebia, they mentioned an X-ray.
[00:54:25.747 --> 00:54:29.347]  He said, in fact, it's in Road to Tyranny, we have a blow-up of the article.
[00:54:30.788 --> 00:54:32.468]  We torture their children in front of them.
[00:54:33.628 --> 00:54:37.149]  And see, the Taxi to the Dark Side didn't even get into the Army's own reports.
[00:54:39.569 --> 00:54:47.471]  It didn't even get into General Togumbo's own report, where it said that they would rape women, rape children, rape people with acid.
[00:54:49.071 --> 00:54:52.332]  I mean, the most ghoulish Jeffrey Dahmer stuff you can imagine.
[00:54:53.439 --> 00:54:56.060]  Now, this is what's going on in the other ghost sites.
[00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:05.223]  And so, part of it, of course, for their country, these CIA doctors rape the children, for America!
[00:55:05.984 --> 00:55:10.825]  And then, you see, they try to bring you into the evil by saying, you don't want Al-Qaeda to get you.
[00:55:13.766 --> 00:55:15.447]  It's the ticking time bomb scenario.
[00:55:15.527 --> 00:55:17.988]  Generally, when I see it in a law enforcement magazine or publication,
[00:55:18.712 --> 00:55:26.715]  They say there's a bomb gonna go off, a nuke that's gonna kill a million people, you've got the person's child, should you crush their genitals.
[00:55:26.755 --> 00:55:27.695]  It's always sexual.
[00:55:27.755 --> 00:55:30.596]  Again, the global elite are very demonic perverts.
[00:55:31.156 --> 00:55:36.378]  And so they're now trying, out of your fear of 9-11, to legitimize sexual perversion.
[00:55:38.699 --> 00:55:41.100]  And we played John Yoo at a Council on Fine Relations meeting.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.521]  He goes, yep, the President's allowed to order the sexual torture of two-year-olds.
[00:55:48.027 --> 00:55:53.609]  Now, I don't know about you out there, cops driving along in your cars, but don't you DARE laugh at me right now.
[00:55:55.229 --> 00:56:00.210]  You think John Yoo would... You think he'd get word with me on close to 70 radio stations?
[00:56:02.231 --> 00:56:08.173]  Lying and saying that he didn't say it's okay for the President to torture small children with testicles and pliers?
[00:56:08.813 --> 00:56:11.914]  Don't you DARE say I'm not telling the truth.
[00:56:12.154 --> 00:56:12.994]  You face it!
[00:56:14.332 --> 00:56:18.334]  You face what I just said, and you ask yourself now, do you support this government?
[00:56:18.614 --> 00:56:20.835]  You ask yourself, do you go along with this?
[00:56:22.576 --> 00:56:24.897]  You see, once you accept torture, folks, it's all over.
[00:56:24.957 --> 00:56:26.177]  Then why not torture children?
[00:56:26.237 --> 00:56:26.977]  Why not rape them?
[00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:33.060]  Now, for the average person, you can't imagine wanting to do something like that.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.261]  It literally tortures me to even think about it.
[00:56:38.722 --> 00:56:40.563]  Because, see, I'm the opposite of a psychopath, folks.
[00:56:40.683 --> 00:56:41.964]  I have incredible feelings.
[00:56:43.832 --> 00:56:48.633]  A psychopath doesn't have bad feelings for others when he hurts them, but he has good feelings when he hurts them.
[00:56:48.913 --> 00:56:49.693]  See, I'm the opposite.
[00:56:50.773 --> 00:56:57.514]  I have feelings of rage and anger and tectonic viciousness when I think about these psychopaths, what I'd like to do to them.
[00:56:59.435 --> 00:57:01.135]  I have an instinct to go after evil.
[00:57:02.155 --> 00:57:03.335]  And by the way, it's nothing special.
[00:57:03.375 --> 00:57:04.055]  I'm not a hero.
[00:57:04.456 --> 00:57:10.096]  It's a normal tribal instinct that God gave us, that when scum is in your tribe, that's hurting little innocents.
[00:57:10.917 --> 00:57:11.677]  I'm a warrior, folks.
[00:57:11.697 --> 00:57:12.857]  I want to take on the big guys.
[00:57:16.244 --> 00:57:19.967]  I can't even get fired up unless some big meathead takes a swing at me first.
[00:57:20.367 --> 00:57:21.308]  Not these psychopaths.
[00:57:21.608 --> 00:57:30.155]  They like to have some little lady strapped down, scared to death, so they can bite them and chomp them and inject them and rape them for weeks and weeks before they kill them.
[00:57:30.395 --> 00:57:30.936]  They like it!
[00:57:31.336 --> 00:57:32.457]  They like hurting innocents.
[00:57:33.318 --> 00:57:38.241]  And I just can't wait till God allows us to take this planet back so we can hunt all of you down.
[00:57:39.042 --> 00:57:42.505]  And I just can't wait to get my hands on you because I know there's some of you listening.
[00:57:44.395 --> 00:57:49.637]  And I am the literal title opposite of you, and I want my hands around your chicken necks!
[00:57:52.037 --> 00:57:53.478]  You are, I know your type.
[00:57:53.518 --> 00:57:55.478]  I can look at you, I can tell who you are.
[00:57:56.118 --> 00:57:58.419]  People like Woolsey, I can look right into his eyes.
[00:57:59.119 --> 00:58:02.040]  People like Bush, people like Hillary, I can look right into their eyes.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.340]  I can see it!
[00:58:03.881 --> 00:58:06.041]  I can see the enemy of the species!
[00:58:06.481 --> 00:58:07.382]  I can see it!
[00:58:08.922 --> 00:58:12.023]  It's not even because I'm smart, ladies and gentlemen, it's because I'm like a dog.
[00:58:12.876 --> 00:58:15.278]  Why does a dumb dog know who a bad person is?
[00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:24.706]  Why does a dumb dog, when some evil person comes around, they can be dressed in a suit, they can have a smile on their face, but the dog don't like them!
[00:58:25.587 --> 00:58:26.828]  Well, I don't like you!
[00:58:27.768 --> 00:58:35.655]  And I swear eternal warfare against you, and all I ask is before God lets them take me away, let a lot of them go down with me!
[00:58:36.055 --> 00:58:37.657]  I want to bring down a new world order!
[00:58:37.697 --> 00:58:38.918]  I want to crush them!
[00:58:43.852 --> 00:58:45.393]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.334 --> 00:58:48.715]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.061 --> 00:58:58.721]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.362 --> 00:59:00.442]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.143 --> 00:59:02.263]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.884 --> 00:59:03.704]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.465 --> 00:59:05.425]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.026 --> 00:59:09.808]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.228 --> 00:59:12.570]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:59:13.454 --> 00:59:14.275]  Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.675 --> 00:59:21.039]  We've got global destabilization news from Pakistan to Kosovo, from Turkey to Belgrade.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:24.101]  We've got financial news, it's incredible.
[00:59:24.581 --> 00:59:27.443]  Foreign trips to be used in the U.S., mainstream news.
[00:59:28.024 --> 00:59:29.925]  But let's go to your calls, I've been ranting enough.
[00:59:31.346 --> 00:59:37.570]  I just think about the Army's own report, how the government rapes children in front of their parents, and how it's even codified now.
[00:59:39.435 --> 00:59:41.836]  It's just demons run everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:41.896 --> 00:59:43.177]  So I just hate them.
[00:59:43.277 --> 00:59:43.657]  I hate them.
[00:59:43.737 --> 00:59:44.077]  I hate them.
[00:59:44.157 --> 00:59:44.477]  I hate them.
[00:59:44.517 --> 00:59:46.218]  I just want to... It's a threat.
[00:59:46.338 --> 00:59:47.839]  I don't rest until they're dealt with.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.360]  And I'm just like a dog, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:53.521]  It's nothing harder to figure out than that.
[00:59:53.541 --> 00:59:55.202]  I don't know how they took your instinct away.
[00:59:55.762 --> 00:59:57.003]  I don't know how they did it to you.
[00:59:57.523 --> 00:59:59.224]  Charles in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[00:59:59.264 --> 00:59:59.584]  Go ahead.
[01:00:00.194 --> 01:00:01.295]  Yeah, how you doing, Jones?
[01:00:01.676 --> 01:00:02.337]  Pretty fired up.
[01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:03.078]  What's on your mind?
[01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:05.460]  Well, the American people have an instinct.
[01:00:05.921 --> 01:00:16.694]  Mr. Jones, talking to the American people is like talking to, I don't know, nothing, because I've been there for confiscations and the guns, and I've seen nothing but men throw up.
[01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:18.629]  Send your wives out with their guns.
[01:00:18.929 --> 01:00:20.810]  And I'm not trying to knock the American people.
[01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:21.750]  I'm in this too.
[01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:23.071]  I'm just as coward as they are.
[01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:24.451]  They're scared to death.
[01:00:24.771 --> 01:00:25.812]  They could rape their children.
[01:00:25.852 --> 01:00:26.952]  They weren't going to do nothing.
[01:00:27.113 --> 01:00:30.114]  They might get on the phone and threaten me, but they ain't going to do nothing.
[01:00:30.394 --> 01:00:38.898]  What we need is some high-school celebrities like Charles Heston, Willie Nelson, Ron Paul, to get up there and give us a march in Washington, D.C., and maybe
[01:00:39.578 --> 01:00:46.925]  The football players will follow, the music players will follow, and we can get some high, efficient people up there to lead us.
[01:00:47.185 --> 01:01:01.217]  But the way it's going right now, Mr. Jones, look, they took this woman in Louisiana, what's that, this woman they beat up on the... Yeah, he turns the video off when he's done, there's a huge pool of audio.
[01:01:01.317 --> 01:01:03.238]  Yeah, his name's Wally Willis.
[01:01:05.091 --> 01:01:07.972]  And they're giving him his job back with the Feds investigating now.
[01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:13.515]  Now, what kind of... And look, you don't even hear people griping about it except on the show with radios.
[01:01:14.556 --> 01:01:15.036]  You understand?
[01:01:15.336 --> 01:01:18.318]  People, well, she was drinking and all this.
[01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:21.519]  All they love is music and football games and beer.
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.260]  That's all they want.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.061]  But I mean, the CIA comes out to test us.
[01:01:26.101 --> 01:01:30.083]  They come out and say, yeah, we're torturing children in front of their parents.
[01:01:30.624 --> 01:01:33.005]  And they just see what we're going to say, see what we're going to do.
[01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:37.073]  Well, they're torturing women in front of our face on television here.
[01:01:37.433 --> 01:01:39.835]  A woman, she just wanted a phone call.
[01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.896]  And what are the people doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:01:42.276 --> 01:01:43.277]  I'm not knocking you.
[01:01:43.337 --> 01:01:44.018]  I believe in you.
[01:01:44.298 --> 01:01:46.119]  But the people are cowards.
[01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:47.520]  They don't know how to fight no more.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.641]  They're just scared to death.
[01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:49.502]  They'll listen to you.
[01:01:49.742 --> 01:01:54.205]  They like it when Will and Nelson's on to hear songs, but that's what they listen to you for.
[01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:55.866]  They're not going to fight for their country.
[01:01:55.886 --> 01:01:57.207]  They ain't going to fight for their children.
[01:01:57.227 --> 01:01:59.428]  They haven't been doing it, and they never will do it.
[01:01:59.629 --> 01:02:01.450]  I was in New Orleans for the conversation.
[01:02:02.205 --> 01:02:03.386]  How many people fought back?
[01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.628]  They were shooting them off a bridge, Mr. Jones!
[01:02:05.949 --> 01:02:07.590]  Off a bridge they were shooting them!
[01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:11.014]  The police were shooting them down like dogs, and they were just running and all that.
[01:02:11.234 --> 01:02:20.463]  And by the way, it's now admitted that nobody was shooting at them, the cops were ordered to not let anybody evacuate, and then no food could be brought in, and so they just sat there shooting people walking on the bridge.
[01:02:20.763 --> 01:02:26.668]  Yeah, women getting raped in a dome stadium, and they were standing outside with dogs, putting dogs on people, asking them for water.
[01:02:26.988 --> 01:02:28.589]  Asking them for water, they were putting dogs on people.
[01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:30.351]  But again, they were ordered to do that.
[01:02:30.591 --> 01:02:32.592]  The Coast Guard wasn't allowed to bring in food.
[01:02:32.693 --> 01:02:34.354]  Police and firemen weren't allowed to come in.
[01:02:34.394 --> 01:02:34.854]  You were there.
[01:02:35.195 --> 01:02:36.836]  It was all done by design.
[01:02:37.776 --> 01:02:39.577]  Tell a woman, how thirsty are you?
[01:02:39.837 --> 01:02:41.897]  Show me your bra, you get one bottle.
[01:02:41.957 --> 01:02:43.718]  Show me your breast, you get two bottles.
[01:02:43.978 --> 01:02:45.218]  I don't care if you got children.
[01:02:45.498 --> 01:02:46.498]  I'm a soldier.
[01:02:46.758 --> 01:02:48.519]  I'm a United States soldier.
[01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:48.959]  I know.
[01:02:49.639 --> 01:02:51.219]  There's video of that, but you witnessed that?
[01:02:51.759 --> 01:02:53.500]  Yes, I witnessed.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:53.720]  Yes.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.400]  Oh, I know.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:55.340]  They're animals, man.
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:55.920]  I'm telling you.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.860]  Most of them are felons.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.161]  American people, they ain't gonna do nothing.
[01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:00.642]  They ain't gonna do it.
[01:03:00.702 --> 01:03:01.282]  I've seen it.
[01:03:01.642 --> 01:03:03.023]  I was there, Mr. Jones.
[01:03:03.383 --> 01:03:04.144]  They have guns.
[01:03:04.164 --> 01:03:05.245]  They will not do nothing.
[01:03:05.405 --> 01:03:06.345]  And I'm including myself.
[01:03:06.405 --> 01:03:07.246]  I'm scared with them.
[01:03:07.686 --> 01:03:08.647]  I'm just as scared.
[01:03:08.847 --> 01:03:10.948]  I'm just as much of a coward as the American people.
[01:03:11.289 --> 01:03:13.870]  Look at the soldiers killing women in Iraq and all that.
[01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:15.251]  We don't have nothing to work with.
[01:03:15.271 --> 01:03:17.012]  We don't have no more guts.
[01:03:17.213 --> 01:03:18.453]  We're domesticated.
[01:03:18.674 --> 01:03:19.794]  We're television lovers.
[01:03:20.054 --> 01:03:21.375]  We're football fans.
[01:03:22.656 --> 01:03:25.118]  We're a nation of demonic, wart-covered pigs.
[01:03:25.618 --> 01:03:26.658]  Well, you know what?
[01:03:27.319 --> 01:03:27.779]  I say this.
[01:03:28.019 --> 01:03:33.940]  Maybe when they go to the camps, like you've been talking about for years, and I know they're there because I've been following you a long time.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.361]  It's now mainstream news.
[01:03:35.381 --> 01:03:39.042]  Maybe they can get Willie Nelson to play some songs and they can really enjoy themselves.
[01:03:39.342 --> 01:03:41.043]  Because that's how it was going, Mr. Jones.
[01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:42.963]  These American people are nothing.
[01:03:43.383 --> 01:03:46.784]  They're whipping women, giving their kids Prozac.
[01:03:46.804 --> 01:03:47.864]  They ain't doing nothing.
[01:03:47.904 --> 01:03:49.625]  They're giving their daughters cancer.
[01:03:50.345 --> 01:03:51.826]  You're the only one standing up for them.
[01:03:51.846 --> 01:03:52.946]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.

[01:04:59.368 --> 01:05:01.269]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.

[01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:10.445]  Few people realize how much benefit the ionic cleansing can be to remove toxins from your body.

[01:06:58.271 --> 01:07:02.453]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:07:03.113 --> 01:07:03.934]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.694 --> 01:07:05.554]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.574 --> 01:07:09.896]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.437 --> 01:07:14.558]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:18.980]  Look, there's no doubt our government's run by total criminals.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:22.462]  They're merging our governments, they're getting rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:07:23.405 --> 01:07:33.809]  The public have been playing violent video games, watching violent TV, going to movies like Saw, going to movies like Hostel, where women are tortured to death and it's so entertaining.
[01:07:34.489 --> 01:07:37.290]  We're being turned into what the elite are right now.
[01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:39.051]  We're being desensitized.
[01:07:39.591 --> 01:07:46.094]  So when the CIA comes out and says, yeah, we're torturing children sexually in front of their parents, a lot of people go, yeah, that's good.
[01:07:46.274 --> 01:07:47.334]  That's good for America.
[01:07:47.574 --> 01:07:49.335]  It's not for America, you idiots.
[01:07:50.256 --> 01:07:51.336]  That's for the global elite.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.502]  And they're recruiting larger cadres of people that'll do this.
[01:07:55.243 --> 01:08:06.532]  It runs the gamut from take your guns, to take your property, right up to their psycho corps that Hitler and Stalin both had them, so did Mao, who will do whatever they're told and who enjoy it.
[01:08:06.912 --> 01:08:08.954]  Who else do you think goes and joins these teams?
[01:08:09.194 --> 01:08:10.595]  Who do you think wants to be jail guards?
[01:08:10.995 --> 01:08:14.278]  Who do you think wants to go work at Abu Ghraib?
[01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:16.000]  Who do you think wants to go do this?
[01:08:17.701 --> 01:08:18.862]  Charles, finish up what you were saying.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:24.523]  Well, another thing is, your movie, Endgame, your DVD, that's a good one.
[01:08:24.563 --> 01:08:32.188]  People, I like it when people call up, I like when they ask, how many times have you seen the DVD, Endgame, or, you know, Loose Change?
[01:08:33.048 --> 01:08:37.511]  People, if they would just give us some indication, when they call in, they would fight back.
[01:08:37.918 --> 01:08:38.458]  Well, they've got...
[01:09:03.343 --> 01:09:09.308]  I really don't, and that's because I just plug a few good sponsors we've got, and I'm just burnt out talking about my videos.
[01:09:09.708 --> 01:09:12.270]  But they really are good films, and I would hope that people would get them.
[01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:13.211]  Charles, God bless you.
[01:09:13.231 --> 01:09:13.872]  Good to hear from you.
[01:09:14.672 --> 01:09:16.374]  Look, I'll just say this about getting down.
[01:09:17.815 --> 01:09:19.796]  Evil's making its move right now in every way.
[01:09:20.957 --> 01:09:31.606]  If they can set the precedent to torture children with pliers, then, and by the way, the film that won the Academy Award last night for Best Documentary,
[01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:39.754]  Taxicab to, um, they offered to even come on the show a few months ago and I was so busy I didn't have them on, because I hadn't seen the film until Friday night.
[01:09:40.754 --> 01:09:42.575]  Showing at the Arbor, here in Austin.
[01:09:43.055 --> 01:09:46.116]  And it's got John Yoo going, yeah, the President's above the law, he can torture children.
[01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:47.557]  He can order the torture of children.
[01:09:48.677 --> 01:09:58.060]  Folks, once you've done that, and once the public accepts that, I mean, they're scientifically, they're top psychiatrists are saying, get them to accept torturing children sexually.
[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.180]  You gotta add that part too.
[01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.861]  That's the worst thing there is, isn't it?
[01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:06.021]  No, they're going to do it because when they do it, they're good.
[01:10:06.121 --> 01:10:08.003]  See, they can do anything.
[01:10:08.043 --> 01:10:09.144]  It's all selective now.
[01:10:10.725 --> 01:10:13.527]  It's bad if you rape a child, but it's good if they do.
[01:10:16.769 --> 01:10:25.656]  And just looking at his pudgy, weak face and the fake little soft voice John Yoo has where he tries to act authoritative, I mean, he is literally a bucket of maggot tripe.
[01:10:30.157 --> 01:10:40.666]  Just soft and weak and wicked, and looking at Alberto Gonzales and Bush and Cheney and all of them, just, just psychopathic mad dog killers.
[01:10:42.287 --> 01:10:45.970]  And I'll tell you right now, I can look at Barack Obama's eyes, I can tell you that guy's evil.
[01:10:47.632 --> 01:10:51.695]  Nothing as evil as Hillary, but he hadn't been baptized, he hadn't been bathed yet.
[01:10:53.276 --> 01:10:57.320]  He's for gun control, open borders, world government, global tax, socialism,
[01:10:58.846 --> 01:11:01.488]  Barack Obama doesn't have a history of these other cats.
[01:11:04.771 --> 01:11:06.212]  But he's evil, I can look in his eye.
[01:11:08.313 --> 01:11:10.215]  Windows to the soul, as the Greeks said.
[01:11:12.476 --> 01:11:14.438]  Bobby in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:16.540]  You there?
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.080]  Yeah!
[01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:23.105]  Hey, uh, there's one website that I would like you to look at, okay?
[01:11:23.285 --> 01:11:25.787]  It's called Libra Rising.
[01:11:25.987 --> 01:11:27.528]  That's Libra, space,
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:28.941]  Rising.
[01:11:29.721 --> 01:11:34.045]  And then when you click that, I want you to go to, uh, conspiracy.
[01:11:34.065 --> 01:11:38.689]  And then after that, you'll see another website that's going to pop up.
[01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:42.572]  Sir, sir, let me, uh, am I trying to run over you here, but we just can't do this.
[01:11:43.453 --> 01:11:47.957]  The key to the internet is not giving out long addresses or impossible navigations.
[01:11:49.098 --> 01:11:53.782]  The name of the article, the name of what it is you want us to know about, that will bring it up.
[01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:55.190]  Okay.
[01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:56.750]  You don't use URLs, sir.
[01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:58.171]  You use search engines.
[01:11:59.771 --> 01:12:00.631]  I understand that.
[01:12:01.031 --> 01:12:02.991]  Okay, but just tell us the name of the article.
[01:12:03.732 --> 01:12:08.832]  Okay, everything that you have said, everything that you have showed is on this website.
[01:12:09.273 --> 01:12:09.733]  Everything.
[01:12:09.913 --> 01:12:12.353]  Okay, well, tell me the name of the subpage.
[01:12:12.393 --> 01:12:13.973]  I mean, tell me the name of this headline.
[01:12:14.813 --> 01:12:23.615]  Okay, well, what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to go to Libra Rising, and then after that you need Conspiracy, and then after that, Secret Covenant,
[01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:32.092]  And you're going to get a reptilian, the secret of the covenant of the reptilians, and it shows everything.
[01:12:32.812 --> 01:12:33.873]  Everything.
[01:12:34.313 --> 01:12:35.933]  Everything you've been talking about.
[01:12:36.613 --> 01:12:37.033]  Everything.
[01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:43.395]  It says an illusion will be so large, so vast, it will escape the perception.
[01:12:43.495 --> 01:12:47.956]  Those who will see it will be thought of as insane.
[01:12:48.016 --> 01:12:49.116]  And it just goes on.
[01:12:49.697 --> 01:12:51.117]  Everything you've been talking about.
[01:12:51.946 --> 01:12:54.687]  Alex, everything is on here.
[01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:56.527]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:57.547 --> 01:13:02.569]  The whole reptilian crowd that thinks space aliens run the planet, say I'm one.
[01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:11.431]  Because on videos, when I look up, there's two lights above me, and it puts a light on each side of my iris, and so it makes it look like I've got cat's eyes.
[01:13:11.451 --> 01:13:19.553]  Of course, they can do that themselves, and it'll look like that, and it's just... Just because the mainstream media lies and the culture is falling apart,
[01:13:20.894 --> 01:13:25.116]  And a lot of crazy stuff's true, does it then mean that everything you see in the alternative is true?
[01:13:26.297 --> 01:13:31.719]  And yeah, the whole Reptoid people, they talk about the Federal Reserve, the New World Order, the FEMA camps, and then they say the Reptoids run it.
[01:13:34.961 --> 01:13:44.685]  You know what, stuff so weird and crazy, the CIA saying torture children publicly with pliers sexually, who knows, it might be true, you know, I don't even know anymore, man.
[01:13:45.326 --> 01:13:48.387]  I'm just going, I mean, I'm going crazy myself, I just can't handle it.
[01:13:49.645 --> 01:13:51.847]  And then all these crazy people calling in.
[01:13:52.948 --> 01:13:53.969]  We're in so much trouble.
[01:13:59.774 --> 01:14:00.575]  Oh, man.
[01:14:04.438 --> 01:14:12.685]  Listen, I've got Pentagon documents from the 60s about how they were going to break us into the North American Union and use foreign troops to police us, okay?
[01:14:12.925 --> 01:14:14.527]  And now it's in major newspapers.
[01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:37.300]  I reported on the FEMA camp purchases years before anybody else did because a listener sent me to the Federal Registry where they were posting who won contracts and it was about Halliburton getting, this was in 2002, three one million man camps and then Newsmax picked it up to their credit and then
[01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:48.102]  Then it was in the Houston Chronicle in January of 2006, and now it's in the San Francisco Chronicle, and they admit it's for the American people.
[01:14:50.223 --> 01:15:01.085]  Now, I can't get the average Mercedes-Benz-driving yuppie who lives in a million-dollar house, who we need to beat this New World Order, but who think they've hit the top.
[01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:01.885]  They think they're the elite.
[01:15:02.966 --> 01:15:07.046]  And they think having kind of this arrogant, fratty, you know, attitude is cute and funny.
[01:15:07.287 --> 01:15:09.507]  Look, man, that's all by the wayside.
[01:15:14.595 --> 01:15:22.100]  And the main thing that holds us back is that a large segment of our supporters, and I'm not saying you, caller.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:23.201]  It's fine to bring this stuff up.
[01:15:23.982 --> 01:15:25.163]  This is a discussion.
[01:15:25.183 --> 01:15:26.523]  I'm not saying you're bad for looking at it.
[01:15:26.544 --> 01:15:27.504]  You know, it can be pondered.
[01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:32.428]  I have people here in my office who pondered it, brought it up to me.
[01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:36.891]  But you can't prove it.
[01:15:38.652 --> 01:15:40.033]  And so if you can't prove it,
[01:15:42.506 --> 01:15:43.927]  There's a lot of weird stuff in this world.
[01:15:43.967 --> 01:15:49.351]  I mean, we're a big rock with a thin layer of life on it, with a thin layer of atmosphere spinning around the sun.
[01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:57.097]  I mean, we're in some, you know... Believe me, I see the weirdness of life, and how amazing it is, and how much we don't know.
[01:15:58.898 --> 01:16:04.923]  The thing is, is that the people that then think it's reptilians... You know, the whole UFO movement has been called a cult.
[01:16:05.003 --> 01:16:06.524]  It is a very cultic thing.
[01:16:08.729 --> 01:16:12.771]  And it's tied into the new age and thinking there's good aliens coming to save us and all the rest of it.
[01:16:14.652 --> 01:16:24.637]  And then they can show you all the ancient clay figurines from the Aztecs, you know, a thousand years old, that have a 747 with four engines on it, with windows down the side.
[01:16:24.677 --> 01:16:29.540]  And I mean, that was confirmed to be in the big Spanish museum 400 years ago.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.741]  I mean, it's real?
[01:16:31.441 --> 01:16:32.482]  What is that, baby?
[01:16:32.642 --> 01:16:33.102]  I don't know.
[01:16:37.924 --> 01:16:45.006]  So I don't blame you for investigating this, but then if I won't come on air and make my show about it, then I'm now a Reptoid Leader.
[01:16:47.906 --> 01:16:53.027]  Or if I won't make my whole show about bashing Jews all day.
[01:16:53.707 --> 01:16:56.608]  I'm covering up the crimes of the wicked Jews.
[01:16:57.428 --> 01:16:58.568]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:16:58.969 --> 01:17:01.129]  I expose the Zionists and what Israel does.
[01:17:03.269 --> 01:17:05.690]  Or I won't say that Catholics are
[01:17:06.554 --> 01:17:08.374]  Running everything under the worst people on earth.
[01:17:08.434 --> 01:17:10.335]  I'll say, yeah, the Pope's calling for world government.
[01:17:10.735 --> 01:17:13.136]  Regardless of when it happened, it's certainly calling for it now.
[01:17:14.376 --> 01:17:15.116]  I'm still that!
[01:17:17.377 --> 01:17:24.638]  And they will twist and lie and spin and... The point is, it's not about me and I don't care if you're sitting there attacking me.
[01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:30.520]  But I wish that you would spend your time going and getting the documents.
[01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:35.801]  We've probably written a hundred articles about foreign tribs with all the documents and reports.
[01:17:39.514 --> 01:17:42.037]  Last night I was laying in bed at like 2 in the morning, couldn't sleep.
[01:17:42.437 --> 01:17:43.698]  I'd been studying all night.
[01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:52.146]  And I was having all these memories about foreign trips, all these memories about articles, all these memories about things I'd forgotten about and reports I'd seen.
[01:17:52.166 --> 01:17:55.009]  And then now I try to call them up, I can't.
[01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:58.412]  And I was just thinking about how pathetic I am.
[01:17:59.614 --> 01:18:04.018]  Because I can't even do a good enough job, I've got so many facts to bring them all to you, but at least what I do bring you is facts.
[01:18:06.528 --> 01:18:09.209]  I mean, if I tell you that the Federal Reserve is private, we document it.
[01:18:09.269 --> 01:18:19.334]  Or if I tell you they're putting sodium fluoride in the water and they know it causes brain damage in everybody, I bring you the documents and I have the guest on and scientists and Nobel Prize winners.
[01:18:20.895 --> 01:18:32.721]  Or if I tell you that the HPV virus is a live cancer virus, doesn't protect you from the cancer, if you have the virus that can give it to you, it gives you a 44% increase, we post articles with their own insert and their own admissions there.
[01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:38.772]  Or when they say it's the law, you gotta take vaccines and it isn't, I go show you how it isn't the law.
[01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:40.572]  And I post the law.
[01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:43.893]  So just, this isn't the show for that.
[01:18:44.073 --> 01:18:46.114]  You know, I just stick to what I can prove.
[01:18:47.235 --> 01:18:53.297]  I know it's sexy and wild and interesting and, you know, to talk about stuff like that, but it just, this isn't the show.
[01:18:54.477 --> 01:18:55.857]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.877 --> 01:18:57.998]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.718 --> 01:19:03.100]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:05.432]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:08.635]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:19:09.215 --> 01:19:11.657]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.398 --> 01:19:19.825]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.747 --> 01:19:27.712]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:28.192 --> 01:19:31.695]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:34.557]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[01:19:34.617 --> 01:19:35.778]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.798 --> 01:19:36.499]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.519 --> 01:19:37.640]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:38.601]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.821 --> 01:19:39.621]  That's what they're after.

[01:19:53.607 --> 01:19:53.948]  I think so.
[01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:15.733]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:20:16.053 --> 01:20:22.038]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:20:22.279 --> 01:20:25.801]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:20:26.062 --> 01:20:30.605]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:20:30.886 --> 01:20:31.666]  Do your part.

[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.521]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:20:59.681 --> 01:21:01.422]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:01.582 --> 01:21:02.823]  The late, great USA.
[01:21:03.063 --> 01:21:04.484]  America, freedom to fascism.
[01:21:04.844 --> 01:21:11.687]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[01:21:52.753 --> 01:21:54.594]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:54.734 --> 01:22:01.438]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:22:01.698 --> 01:22:09.883]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:22:10.103 --> 01:22:15.486]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[01:22:58.132 --> 01:23:04.355]  Alright, I gotta blast through your calls a little bit faster because Little Class may be subject to food rations, warns the UN.
[01:23:04.375 --> 01:23:06.216]  We'll be getting into that next.
[01:23:07.297 --> 01:23:13.640]  John in Washington State, then Lavone, Bryden, Mike, Eric, and others.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.960]  Go ahead, you're on the air, John.
[01:23:15.921 --> 01:23:17.001]  Hello, Alex.
[01:23:17.301 --> 01:23:20.463]  I've got a phone call here for you that is meat and potatoes.
[01:23:21.603 --> 01:23:23.785]  We are in Washington State.
[01:23:23.845 --> 01:23:26.646]  I live in the northeast corner of Washington State.
[01:23:27.065 --> 01:23:29.589]  We have a governor named Christine Gregoire.
[01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:35.738]  They have now SB 5813 in the committees.
[01:23:35.778 --> 01:23:37.420]  They're having hearings on it this week.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.002]  Say it again, SB what? 5813.
[01:23:41.638 --> 01:23:45.279]  What it is, is to implement the Y2Y Corridor.
[01:23:45.359 --> 01:23:48.580]  They're calling this the Yukon to Yellowstone Corridor.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.121]  Yeah, there's 83 corridors and I have seen that.
[01:23:51.421 --> 01:23:56.543]  Seizing the roads and handing it over for international control, but of course that road doesn't exist.
[01:23:56.863 --> 01:24:00.864]  Well, Washington is, this is a wildlife corridor.
[01:24:02.498 --> 01:24:06.740]  No, I know, but that ties into the roads.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.041]  Then they make the other roads fit.
[01:24:09.281 --> 01:24:12.543]  See, people think that it's just roads or just highway projects.
[01:24:12.843 --> 01:24:16.385]  They also grab the land on each side for the nature corridors.
[01:24:16.645 --> 01:24:17.905]  Exactly, for buffer zones.
[01:24:17.945 --> 01:24:28.390]  But what I'm calling about is that we really need for your listeners to help us out here and submit comments for the record.
[01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:29.111]  I
[01:24:41.808 --> 01:24:47.233]  It ties in, it dovetails exactly with what you were just talking about, the merger of the militaries.
[01:24:47.593 --> 01:24:50.535]  They know there's going to be trouble on the border when this happens.
[01:24:50.875 --> 01:24:55.599]  My house is exactly in the middle of the path as are hundreds of others.
[01:24:55.659 --> 01:24:56.560]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:03.145]  Already the West is over 70 percent, some states over 90 percent, fed and state-owned.
[01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:07.609]  And now by doing this, they're going to go after the people.
[01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:09.750]  And if you overlay the 83
[01:25:11.525 --> 01:25:19.748]  Well, they have what's called the Arctic Boreal, then the spine of the continent, which actually skirts your state, Texas.
[01:25:36.383 --> 01:25:52.409]  They've got the Pacific Corridor and the Atlantic Corridor, but they are being very deceptive in the fact that they're just talking about Yukon to Yellowstone, because that's less than a third of what there are, maybe even less than a fourth of what they're actually trying to implement, and they're shoving this down our throats.
[01:25:52.429 --> 01:26:04.154]  Listen, the UN is also the core spokes, the 54 biosphere reserves, it may have grown to 54 last time I checked, and then they next us out, I mean, 15 years ago.
[01:26:04.714 --> 01:26:05.375]  Wait, let me go back.
[01:26:07.577 --> 01:26:05.375]  1996.
[01:26:08.318 --> 01:26:09.258]  That's 12 years ago.
[01:26:10.099 --> 01:26:16.125]  They were already going in with the UN Biospheres and telling a gold mine 100 miles away they couldn't mine.
[01:26:16.585 --> 01:26:17.606]  Well, they're doing that here.
[01:26:17.646 --> 01:26:28.677]  They're going to put one of the gold mine projects that's about 90% complete right now, spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this, and they're going to put that under and eliminate all those jobs.
[01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:37.549]  Not to mention the fact that I've been trying to tell people around here for six years now that this was going to happen, and now all of a sudden my phone's ringing off the wall.
[01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:38.990]  We're sending emails.
[01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:40.871]  We're trying to... I met with Joel Kretz.
[01:26:40.911 --> 01:26:44.573]  He is our congressman that is leading the fight against this.
[01:26:45.274 --> 01:26:50.517]  And there is a email address that you can send comments to.
[01:26:50.857 --> 01:26:58.661]  They need to literally be covered up with comments, and they will print these and enter them into the record, because it's not going to just affect Washington.
[01:26:58.681 --> 01:27:00.401]  This is going to be all the way down.
[01:27:00.441 --> 01:27:00.802]  No, no, no.
[01:27:00.822 --> 01:27:02.683]  This is a deal they're doing state by state.
[01:27:02.703 --> 01:27:03.743]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:03.823 --> 01:27:05.004]  We'll look into that.
[01:27:05.024 --> 01:27:07.805]  I'm aware that they're trying to put... Look, the whole agenda's happening now.
[01:27:08.866 --> 01:27:13.708]  But remember, I've seen CNN and Fox say the Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[01:27:14.702 --> 01:27:19.463]  I mean, I've seen them on tape, we've played it here, saying Ron Paul's insane, none of this exists.
[01:27:20.963 --> 01:27:26.785]  It doesn't matter if there's billboards up, the governor vetoed the state legislature, crime the blocking, everybody in Texas knows it's real.
[01:27:28.085 --> 01:27:32.906]  That's not... When the media says it doesn't exist, that's an order to yuppies.
[01:27:34.246 --> 01:27:41.928]  That, hey, if you're going to be cool and trendy, we're saying you're not allowed to admit to yourself it exists.
[01:27:42.933 --> 01:27:46.696]  CNN and Fox are saying, hey, we know you know the Trans-Texas Corridor is real.
[01:27:48.497 --> 01:27:51.920]  But you need to double think now and say it doesn't exist.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.202]  Because you like to act tough and steadily and think you're on top of everything.
[01:27:56.243 --> 01:27:58.245]  So, you know, you play right into our plans.
[01:27:58.285 --> 01:28:01.427]  So we're telling you, we laugh at you if you say this exists.
[01:28:01.848 --> 01:28:03.949]  So it doesn't matter if you see your road getting taken over.
[01:28:03.969 --> 01:28:06.251]  It doesn't matter if you see the signs and the toll roads.
[01:28:07.014 --> 01:28:10.256]  It doesn't exist even when you're paying for it and going through it.
[01:28:10.596 --> 01:28:13.018]  And they say, yes sir, it doesn't exist.
[01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:15.039]  And they won't talk about it to neighbors.
[01:28:15.459 --> 01:28:17.280]  They won't talk about it when they drive through it.
[01:28:18.301 --> 01:28:20.342]  They'll actually go through toll roads and pay them.
[01:28:20.482 --> 01:28:21.763]  By the way, I'm not joking here.
[01:28:22.183 --> 01:28:24.165]  And then say that doesn't exist as they pay.
[01:28:24.845 --> 01:28:27.767]  Because CNN said it didn't exist.
[01:28:28.788 --> 01:28:32.530]  So see, they're telling them it's not kosher to talk about this.
[01:28:34.344 --> 01:28:41.770]  LeBron, Bryden, Mike, Eric, I'm going to hit you when we get back, and then I'm going to get into the other news.
[01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:43.211]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.032 --> 01:28:44.953]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.433 --> 01:28:47.035]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:50.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.540]  It's progressing.
[01:28:54.961 --> 01:28:58.862]  And it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[01:28:59.343 --> 01:29:00.763]  We are entering martial law.
[01:29:01.264 --> 01:29:03.425]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.
[01:29:03.945 --> 01:29:05.165]  America has them all.

[01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:54.662]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:29:55.003 --> 01:30:00.486]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:30:01.126 --> 01:30:06.869]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:10.871]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:30:11.512 --> 01:30:14.794]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:30:15.414 --> 01:30:18.716]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy, and foolish.
[01:30:19.375 --> 01:30:23.878]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.600]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:30:27.241 --> 01:30:30.583]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:30:31.263 --> 01:30:34.186]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:30:34.926 --> 01:30:41.811]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:30:42.531 --> 01:30:42.792]  Call 800-409-5633.

[01:31:37.483 --> 01:31:38.624]  I was sittin' in traffic, listenin' to the radio
[01:32:09.239 --> 01:32:10.620]  Welcome back!
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.061]  Alright, uh...

[01:32:47.596 --> 01:32:48.376]  There is a lot of it.
[01:32:49.677 --> 01:32:50.838]  I like to hear from listeners.
[01:32:50.858 --> 01:32:52.239]  You know, I never tell you what to call in about.
[01:32:52.359 --> 01:32:53.500]  We don't screen your calls.
[01:32:54.361 --> 01:33:02.947]  The mainstream media is announcing that they're merging the Canadian, U.S., and, by the way, Mexican military together for, quote, emergencies and to deal with terrorists.
[01:33:03.808 --> 01:33:05.169]  Is that newsworthy to you?
[01:33:05.349 --> 01:33:06.870]  I mean, is that a big deal?
[01:33:07.907 --> 01:33:09.807]  Is it all just kind of foregone conclusion here?
[01:33:12.568 --> 01:33:16.929]  The UN is talking about even middle class food shortages, even for the middle class.
[01:33:20.770 --> 01:33:24.931]  And what do you want to bet is we get more and more global government, more and more global control, it's just going to get worse and worse.
[01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:29.351]  But they'll always be there to fix it, to make it worse, and then to make it worse again.
[01:33:30.912 --> 01:33:36.873]  Always denying they're behind it until they get you into the next phase, and then by then we've got such short attention spans everybody forgets.
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:42.842]  I mean, when you're a bunch of ill-informed idiots, you're going to get enslaved.
[01:33:44.223 --> 01:33:45.063]  Myself included.
[01:33:45.144 --> 01:33:46.004]  I don't want to be a slave.
[01:33:46.064 --> 01:33:46.845]  I want to be informed.
[01:33:48.406 --> 01:33:50.587]  Inner Food is the best green food out there.
[01:33:50.767 --> 01:33:57.451]  It's got 20 superfoods in it, like spirulina, chlorella, wheatgrass, barleygrass, kelp, dulse, and 14 other ingredients.
[01:33:57.891 --> 01:34:08.338]  Balanced energy all day long, weight loss, 20 power-packed ingredients, greater mental clarity, reduced food cravings, healthy radiant skin, helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels, improve liver function, healthy blood sugar,
[01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:10.751]  Immune system boosting.
[01:34:11.392 --> 01:34:12.512]  Just two little bitty scoops.
[01:34:12.532 --> 01:34:14.554]  Little bitty scoop in this little plastic keg.
[01:34:15.274 --> 01:34:16.935]  And you put it in your fruit juice, drink it down.
[01:34:17.035 --> 01:34:18.456]  It's not a vitamin or mineral.
[01:34:18.516 --> 01:34:19.597]  It's the raw foods.
[01:34:20.138 --> 01:34:21.138]  Unpasteurized.
[01:34:21.258 --> 01:34:21.839]  Great stuff.
[01:34:21.859 --> 01:34:24.440]  1-866-762-9238 is the number.
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:25.081]  1-866-762-9238 or interfood.com.
[01:34:25.101 --> 01:34:26.462]  Go to InfoWars.com and link through on the site.
[01:34:36.949 --> 01:34:42.311]  To the Interfood site, you get 10% off on that subpage, the Alex Jones page there on their website.
[01:34:42.512 --> 01:34:45.393]  You can find that banner on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:46.073 --> 01:34:55.277]  Also, New Vitality is a big, you know, respected vitamin mineral health maker, and we're really proud to have them as sponsors.
[01:34:56.518 --> 01:35:01.640]  And they approached us a few months ago, and I had to try out some of their products first.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.481]  It's just, the stuff I already knew was really good, I already knew about New Vitality, but
[01:35:06.756 --> 01:35:08.597]  I chose because I don't know about the properties.
[01:35:08.617 --> 01:35:11.478]  People say hemp's the most powerful, you know, magic plant.
[01:35:11.598 --> 01:35:12.178]  I disagree.
[01:35:12.198 --> 01:35:14.659]  I think it's neck and neck with aloe vera.
[01:35:15.699 --> 01:35:16.460]  I've seen the studies.
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:24.643]  And the aloe-ease colon and body cleanse, folks, there's people selling stuff that's incredibly expensive that doesn't really, you know, cleanse you out.
[01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:28.962]  You know, these quacks claiming they've got this or that.
[01:35:29.002 --> 01:35:36.264]  I mean, this is just good old-fashioned aloe vera, and it is amazing in the way it'll clean you out and the toxins it'll suck out of your body.
[01:35:36.964 --> 01:35:43.466]  Aloe is our herbal dietary supplement developed to support healthy stomach, healthy bowels.
[01:35:43.686 --> 01:35:45.987]  Aloe is all-natural ingredients, nutritional support.
[01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:47.547]  There's so much.
[01:35:47.627 --> 01:35:49.428]  Just go to our website and find out about it.
[01:35:51.423 --> 01:36:00.187]  Or give them a call at 1-800-569-4056.
[01:36:00.207 --> 01:36:00.707]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:36:00.727 --> 01:36:04.509]  You can ask them about all their other products when you call our catalog.
[01:36:04.529 --> 01:36:04.829]  800-569-4056.
[01:36:04.849 --> 01:36:09.091]  Aloes, colon, and body cleanse.
[01:36:09.531 --> 01:36:12.973]  I mean, this is just concentrated aloe vera tablets.
[01:36:12.993 --> 01:36:13.633]  You can't beat it.
[01:36:13.853 --> 01:36:15.154]  Aloe vera is magic, folks.
[01:36:16.074 --> 01:36:19.856]  And in closing on that subject, I have made
[01:36:21.235 --> 01:36:21.815]  We're good to go.
[01:36:43.118 --> 01:36:44.139]  What do psychopaths do?
[01:36:44.199 --> 01:36:45.779]  They like the power of hurting people.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:56.985]  And then they scientifically codify it and say, well, we've got to dumb them down to make it more easy to manage, and because we're so great, we've got to not have them interfering with us for the great civilization we're building.
[01:36:58.066 --> 01:37:01.188]  We've got to dumb them down so we can set up the extermination grid to get rid of them.
[01:37:01.548 --> 01:37:04.930]  It documents how they're killing you now and how they plan to kill you even faster.
[01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:06.891]  It's a film you might want to see.
[01:37:06.951 --> 01:37:11.273]  It's in-game blueprint for global enslavement at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free
[01:37:14.305 --> 01:37:15.646]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:16.847 --> 01:37:19.409]  Charles called in and reminded me that I really don't even plug the films anymore.
[01:37:19.749 --> 01:37:21.810]  It's one of the biggest tools we've got to wake people up.
[01:37:21.850 --> 01:37:26.193]  Not just the films I've made, but all the other books and videos we carry at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:26.474 --> 01:37:29.476]  Go peruse the Safe, Secure, Online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:37:30.658 --> 01:37:38.765]  And then you can order online, or order by phone, or write to me at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:37:39.265 --> 01:37:39.606]  Okay.
[01:37:40.727 --> 01:37:42.268]  Each caller brings up such good points.
[01:37:42.308 --> 01:37:43.829]  I've been having them on about five minutes apiece.
[01:37:43.889 --> 01:37:46.191]  I gotta go faster here, or I'll never get to all this other news.
[01:37:49.835 --> 01:37:53.958]  Lovano, or whoever it was from Texas, just hung up as I was going to you.
[01:37:54.819 --> 01:37:57.201]  Brighton in British Columbia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:37:58.809 --> 01:37:59.570]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:37:59.890 --> 01:38:00.270]  Good, good.
[01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:01.471]  You got a radio or something on?
[01:38:01.511 --> 01:38:03.153]  I'm gonna have to let you go up and answer.
[01:38:03.173 --> 01:38:05.655]  I think it might just be the background here.
[01:38:05.675 --> 01:38:06.936]  I got a bunch of buddies just showed up.
[01:38:07.097 --> 01:38:07.637]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:38:07.677 --> 01:38:07.997]  Go ahead.
[01:38:08.558 --> 01:38:12.782]  Yeah, I just got something for you and, like, Mr. Nelson, you know, and Paris.
[01:38:12.862 --> 01:38:14.583]  Like, you guys are heroes, you know?
[01:38:14.603 --> 01:38:16.625]  It's a poem.
[01:38:16.765 --> 01:38:17.166]  Here we go.
[01:38:17.986 --> 01:38:21.009]  Free, conscious, brave-minded humans who are destined to withhold truth.
[01:38:21.249 --> 01:38:22.310]  A truly heroic feat.
[01:38:22.731 --> 01:38:23.131]  Heroism.
[01:38:23.735 --> 01:38:43.567]  Those who walk in and out, those who talk and never shout, who are always calm and clear, away from fear, grasp upon what is near the coming year, give what is taken and take more back, make what is living to stay on track, by always being you, not just a number, by always being true or else eternal slumber, for it is our children who need us to lead before they don't have the chance to succeed.
[01:38:43.967 --> 01:38:52.232]  In this life marked by banks and greed, in years they will give us thanks to plead, great worship to humans who witness truth and even greater self-pride to who accept truth
[01:38:52.662 --> 01:38:54.283]  Because truth is what we are destined to.
[01:38:54.663 --> 01:38:56.064]  Truth is what runs in our blood.
[01:38:56.684 --> 01:38:58.765]  The greatest warrior who takes on a brigade.
[01:38:58.805 --> 01:39:00.606]  The noble soldier who takes on a parade.
[01:39:01.007 --> 01:39:02.968]  Of the wickedest enemy there is no friend in thee.
[01:39:03.248 --> 01:39:04.929]  To those who take away our day and night.
[01:39:05.349 --> 01:39:07.350]  To those who fake away to take our insight.
[01:39:07.931 --> 01:39:09.812]  Those who are conscious must wake up the rest.
[01:39:09.872 --> 01:39:11.833]  Those who are conscious must take care of the nest.
[01:39:12.233 --> 01:39:13.834]  To be extra brave and not a slave.
[01:39:13.874 --> 01:39:15.415]  We can't save everything in our cave.
[01:39:15.435 --> 01:39:17.836]  It's time to speak on what it is that is free.
[01:39:17.876 --> 01:39:19.277]  It's time that we need to make this be.
[01:39:19.932 --> 01:39:21.593]  Time and Heroics back my knowledge.
[01:39:21.934 --> 01:39:22.834]  Fear teaches itself.
[01:39:23.315 --> 01:39:24.215]  No need for college.
[01:39:24.235 --> 01:39:26.637]  The basis is for this money.
[01:39:26.677 --> 01:39:27.878]  This paper is not funny.
[01:39:27.958 --> 01:39:29.499]  With it comes greed with laziness.
[01:39:29.599 --> 01:39:31.000]  It doesn't feed this craziness.
[01:39:31.521 --> 01:39:34.683]  All we need is freedom and water, so we can become a whole lot smarter.
[01:39:34.703 --> 01:39:38.326]  To become freed, we need to lead, to do our deed, and to succeed.
[01:39:38.686 --> 01:39:41.268]  The truth of our existence, this all comes with persistence.
[01:39:41.428 --> 01:39:44.871]  To heal this orthic organism, through true heroism.
[01:39:47.697 --> 01:39:48.677]  Well, that was excellent.
[01:39:48.717 --> 01:39:52.499]  You ought to write that down or post it on the InfoWars message board or something.
[01:39:53.319 --> 01:39:54.340]  Yeah, I already got it on there.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:54.880]  Good.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:55.420]  Good job.
[01:39:55.781 --> 01:39:58.302]  Oh, there's quite a few people in there doing poetry.
[01:39:59.462 --> 01:40:02.043]  I'm really honored that you would come share that with us.
[01:40:02.123 --> 01:40:04.384]  It was very thought-provoking.
[01:40:05.145 --> 01:40:06.885]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:40:06.905 --> 01:40:07.386]  Anything else?
[01:40:07.406 --> 01:40:09.607]  No, not really.
[01:40:11.187 --> 01:40:11.888]  Take care, my friend.
[01:40:11.908 --> 01:40:12.528]  Good to hear from you.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:24.349]  You know, I was thinking about psychopaths last night, the last two nights, because I was reading up on psychology and psychopaths, and I have a whole discussion that I've thought about that I wanted to have on air.
[01:40:24.849 --> 01:40:41.882]  I'll try to get to it later in the third hour, dig out some of the stories and articles I printed up about it, but I can't imagine not being a human who's operating properly, not having my feelings.
[01:40:42.655 --> 01:40:44.517]  Not having empathy for the weak.
[01:40:45.297 --> 01:40:46.678]  Not wanting to help people.
[01:40:48.159 --> 01:40:50.181]  Not wanting to be good.
[01:40:51.462 --> 01:40:58.787]  But not just... Because the elite, the psychopaths, the sociopaths, they see us as weak.
[01:40:58.827 --> 01:40:59.408]  They laugh at us.
[01:40:59.428 --> 01:41:00.729]  They say, we are scientific.
[01:41:02.150 --> 01:41:06.433]  We are cold-blooded because we know the job has to be done.
[01:41:07.174 --> 01:41:09.556]  It's you people that are weak because you have all these emotions.
[01:41:09.976 --> 01:41:11.197]  But then I study the elite
[01:41:12.162 --> 01:41:13.303]  They're not just cold.
[01:41:13.403 --> 01:41:14.184]  Some of them are cold.
[01:41:14.804 --> 01:41:19.968]  Some of them are technicians, but even the elite themselves and their minions, they enjoy.
[01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:23.231]  I mean, they like dead bodies.
[01:41:23.751 --> 01:41:26.113]  They like blowing up buildings full of men, women, and children.
[01:41:26.153 --> 01:41:29.276]  They like torturing children in front of their parents.
[01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:31.638]  They enjoy the howling and screaming and pain.
[01:41:31.658 --> 01:41:34.020]  You know, all that energy that's being released.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.341]  It's a thrill to them.
[01:41:36.141 --> 01:41:39.264]  That's a hallmark of psychopaths, is that they
[01:41:42.185 --> 01:41:43.486]  They say it's like they're dead.
[01:41:45.987 --> 01:41:55.232]  And they feel real scientific and real mathematical and they just see people who have emotions as pathetic and they want to do things to them.
[01:41:55.612 --> 01:41:56.553]  They want to break them.
[01:41:58.254 --> 01:41:59.234]  And they want to use them.
[01:42:01.736 --> 01:42:09.740]  And then after the minority of psychopaths get, also are sadistic psychopaths, and so they get into killing, torturing, usually animals when they're small,
[01:42:11.491 --> 01:42:15.333]  And they become callous, and then it's like, they describe it as everything's darkness.
[01:42:15.373 --> 01:42:16.154]  They're very unhappy.
[01:42:16.174 --> 01:42:16.934]  They're very bored.
[01:42:17.354 --> 01:42:29.041]  Unless they get that young woman in the car, or that child in the car, and then when they've got them at that shack, torturing them, and pouring hot oil on them, and ripping their toenails out, and raping them, they just, it's like a bright light.
[01:42:29.101 --> 01:42:38.086]  They just, and you've heard me interview some of the top experts that interview the psychopaths, some of the top psychologists, psychiatrists, and you know, that's how they describe it.
[01:42:39.517 --> 01:42:41.678]  And so, to them, nuclear war is beautiful.
[01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:43.800]  To them, a bioweapon being released is great.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.281]  To them, a war is good.
[01:42:46.782 --> 01:42:52.065]  To them... To them, it's also real fun to fool the public.
[01:42:52.105 --> 01:42:54.367]  And, you know, they sit around at the White House and laugh.
[01:42:54.787 --> 01:42:57.449]  Look, we can admit we're raping children and they think we're good now.
[01:42:57.509 --> 01:42:58.389]  We've really sold them.
[01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:59.450]  Ah, yes!
[01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:03.112]  I mean, you know... I mean, they're... That's what psychopaths like to do.
[01:43:03.152 --> 01:43:04.193]  They like to push it.
[01:43:04.553 --> 01:43:06.074]  And they always get more and more arrogant.
[01:43:06.094 --> 01:43:07.495]  They always get more and more reckless.
[01:43:07.815 --> 01:43:08.776]  They want to be caught.
[01:43:09.824 --> 01:43:10.665]  I'm already getting into this.
[01:43:11.925 --> 01:43:13.206]  But it's not just psychopaths.
[01:43:13.326 --> 01:43:17.208]  They also then have a bunch of well-meaning people that believe in justifies the means.
[01:43:17.688 --> 01:43:22.351]  Like a lot of these generals, they're not even psychopathic.
[01:43:22.391 --> 01:43:23.412]  It's a power trip.
[01:43:23.432 --> 01:43:31.456]  They falsely imprinted and believe it's manly to blow things up and to have the will to, you know, order a fleet of aircraft to drop bombs on a city.
[01:43:35.155 --> 01:43:41.459]  And to them, they say, well, the Muslim extremists are going to attack us and are going to kill us if we don't go over there and kill them.
[01:43:42.539 --> 01:43:46.181]  And so, yeah, so what if we're torturing?
[01:43:46.221 --> 01:43:47.502]  The end justifies the means.
[01:43:48.162 --> 01:44:00.409]  A general will say, just like I'd send a squad into an area to draw enemy fire, we know that squad's going to get killed, but then we can wipe out a larger group of the enemy, and then we'll win this war faster, and overall, that'll save lives.
[01:44:03.167 --> 01:44:07.350]  Once you've made that decision, and justifies the means, well, you're raping children.
[01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:10.051]  To get answers out of their parents.
[01:44:10.151 --> 01:44:12.312]  Oh, you won't talk and say you carried out 9-11?
[01:44:12.773 --> 01:44:15.034]  I'll take your child in here and crush their fingers.
[01:44:16.055 --> 01:44:16.915]  Oh, that isn't working.
[01:44:16.935 --> 01:44:18.556]  Well, I'll crush their genitalia.
[01:44:19.697 --> 01:44:20.457]  That's what they do.
[01:44:23.079 --> 01:44:26.821]  Or imagine some fat jail guard raping your 10-year-old daughter in front of you.
[01:44:26.861 --> 01:44:27.701]  That's what they do.
[01:44:28.722 --> 01:44:30.523]  Now, the fat jail guard likes to do it.
[01:44:32.429 --> 01:44:35.590]  They'd hire former federal guards who'd been in a lot of trouble.
[01:44:35.610 --> 01:44:37.071]  They, oh, don't you want a better paid job?
[01:44:37.091 --> 01:44:37.651]  Come on here.
[01:44:39.032 --> 01:44:45.194]  But it's the CIA guys who are cold and calculating above, you know, with the video cameras watching, who give them the orders.
[01:44:45.835 --> 01:44:47.015]  They're at an even sicker level.
[01:44:47.035 --> 01:44:50.217]  They just enjoy the watching someone do it for them.
[01:44:51.137 --> 01:44:58.020]  And then they jump on a plane and fly into Uzbekistan or into Cairo, Egypt, and then they go into a glistening facility
[01:44:58.740 --> 01:45:03.461]  Put on their masks, put on their surgical gloves, and, I'm the doctor.
[01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:05.401]  I'm gonna go do my work now.
[01:45:10.522 --> 01:45:14.323]  And they're psycho geniuses with like 160, 170 IQs.
[01:45:14.343 --> 01:45:23.545]  And they've got all these good old boys working under them that, yeah, we staged a few attacks, but, you know, we wouldn't have done that on 9-11.
[01:45:25.606 --> 01:45:29.049]  We wouldn't have been able to have a larger takeover for the U.S.
[01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:30.830]  and for Israel, because we know best.
[01:45:31.531 --> 01:45:33.032]  You know, 3,000 is nothing.
[01:45:33.052 --> 01:45:35.774]  Did you know 200,000 die a year on the highways?
[01:45:36.515 --> 01:45:41.719]  Yeah, we killed 3,000, but it was so we could fight the Muslim extremists.
[01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:47.664]  And then they take that poor squad of idiots that planted the bombs, and they all die in car wrecks in the next six months.
[01:45:51.112 --> 01:45:52.493]  And they get a new squad of idiots.
[01:45:53.114 --> 01:45:56.796]  You gotta know they killed everybody involved in the ground in that operation.
[01:46:07.625 --> 01:46:09.787]  Man, I think about DynCorp and those airfields.
[01:46:09.847 --> 01:46:12.068]  I mean, every night, thousands of kids getting loaded on.
[01:46:12.088 --> 01:46:13.530]  They're going to this guy, that guy.
[01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:17.032]  They're going to the 50-plus thousand Arab princes in Saudi Arabia.
[01:46:17.052 --> 01:46:18.173]  They're being flown into Israel.
[01:46:18.593 --> 01:46:20.335]  They're being flown into Thailand.
[01:46:21.167 --> 01:46:29.188]  Or they're being flown to literally be chained on an island for the rest of their lives to a sewing machine.
[01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:39.150]  I think about everything we've had, everything we've had in this country, how good it's been, and how you've become a bunch of decadent scum.
[01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:42.651]  I'm talking to not our listeners, but new listeners who are laughing at us right now.
[01:46:42.951 --> 01:46:44.811]  You won't go look up all the things I've said.
[01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:46.131]  You won't believe any of it.
[01:46:46.571 --> 01:46:50.812]  You've got to be in a ditch, stuck in the end of a barrel of a gun.
[01:46:52.768 --> 01:46:53.769]  Before you wake up.
[01:46:55.069 --> 01:46:57.350]  Let's take a call and we'll cover some financial news when we get back.
[01:46:57.410 --> 01:47:01.772]  Then, middle class may be subject to food, rations, financial times of London.
[01:47:02.213 --> 01:47:03.913]  Vaccinating boys with Gardasil.
[01:47:04.354 --> 01:47:06.435]  Crystal, I recommend the politics of fear.
[01:47:08.176 --> 01:47:13.078]  I got a bunch more news on Obama targets NAFTA, but says supporters, says he supports free trade.
[01:47:14.078 --> 01:47:14.879]  I got a lot of news.
[01:47:14.899 --> 01:47:16.079]  We covered some of it in the first hour.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.420]  Had a lot of news in the first hour.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:18.381]  Haven't yet on this end.
[01:47:18.781 --> 01:47:21.242]  We're going to do it, but your calls are great because they bring us in different directions.
[01:47:22.792 --> 01:47:24.233]  Let's talk to Mike in New York.
[01:47:24.293 --> 01:47:25.173]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:47:26.713 --> 01:47:26.953]  Alex.
[01:47:27.373 --> 01:47:27.593]  Hey.
[01:47:28.194 --> 01:47:34.796]  Hey, I sent a email to Aaron with a link from a press release from the United States Northern Command.
[01:47:34.816 --> 01:47:36.736]  It came out on February 1st.
[01:47:37.616 --> 01:47:38.877]  And I'll just touch on it real quick.
[01:47:39.437 --> 01:47:44.038]  They stand ready for any homeland defense or civil support mission.
[01:47:45.118 --> 01:47:50.500]  They're supporting all the Department of Defense focus on homeland defense, including planning and exercising.
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.141]  As well as organizing new headquarters.
[01:47:53.401 --> 01:47:55.223]  And then they next descend to every city, you know?
[01:47:55.463 --> 01:47:55.923]  You got it.
[01:47:56.123 --> 01:47:56.503]  You got it.
[01:47:56.603 --> 01:48:03.908]  They have National Guard civil support teams in every state, territory, 17 regions, and on and on and on it goes.
[01:48:03.988 --> 01:48:05.169]  And it's already federalized.
[01:48:05.209 --> 01:48:07.310]  Bush has already implemented PDD 51.
[01:48:09.792 --> 01:48:10.212]  Keep going.
[01:48:11.233 --> 01:48:12.734]  Well, I just wanted to share that with you.
[01:48:12.794 --> 01:48:15.296]  I mean, now they're coming out and just putting it right out in the open.
[01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:17.357]  Right off their website.
[01:48:17.694 --> 01:48:22.176]  Well, NORTHCOM says we are a occupied military combat zone.
[01:48:22.796 --> 01:48:26.898]  We are under Northern Command control and they openly hail to the Fortune 100.
[01:48:28.559 --> 01:48:30.320]  I mean, we're already completely captured.
[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:32.461]  Now they just want to take our private property.
[01:48:32.481 --> 01:48:38.283]  So they're changing the rules there and training death squads to come by and machine gun you and your whole family if you don't do it.
[01:48:38.963 --> 01:48:40.264]  That's what they're trying to set up.
[01:48:41.641 --> 01:48:50.484]  Todd, I can't believe they're... and the military is... they are accelerating the turnover to our military being nothing but felons and illegal aliens.
[01:48:50.504 --> 01:48:52.285]  What do you think of that?
[01:48:52.505 --> 01:48:53.265]  It's simply amazing.
[01:48:53.325 --> 01:48:57.867]  Even in their own title, United States Northern Command Defending Our Home Lands.
[01:48:58.727 --> 01:49:00.227]  This isn't about the United States.
[01:49:01.148 --> 01:49:07.290]  And when you mention the general here, this General Gene Renard, I bet you... and I'm going to go do a little research on that.
[01:49:07.330 --> 01:49:10.631]  I bet you would come to find out that he's probably not even a United States
[01:49:11.132 --> 01:49:12.053]  Military person.
[01:49:13.013 --> 01:49:16.575]  I heard back when we were under... what was it?
[01:49:17.575 --> 01:49:18.936]  John Shelley Cashvely.
[01:49:19.336 --> 01:49:19.816]  You got it.
[01:49:20.897 --> 01:49:24.259]  Yeah, his dad was a top Nazi general in Poland.
[01:49:24.699 --> 01:49:26.039]  Ran most of the death camps.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.621]  Madeleine Albright's dad killed over a million.
[01:49:28.661 --> 01:49:29.761]  That's mainstream news.
[01:49:30.242 --> 01:49:32.523]  It's even come out of houses full of stolen art.
[01:49:34.103 --> 01:49:36.925]  These people are hardcore murderers.
[01:49:38.326 --> 01:49:39.146]  And it's here.
[01:49:40.037 --> 01:49:41.339]  We're already under martial law.
[01:49:41.359 --> 01:49:42.000]  Let me explain that.
[01:49:42.020 --> 01:49:43.262]  They've got the safety off.
[01:49:43.703 --> 01:49:44.625]  They've loaded the gun.
[01:49:44.685 --> 01:49:45.566]  It's chambered around.
[01:49:45.606 --> 01:49:46.467]  It's to your head.
[01:49:46.488 --> 01:49:49.593]  And they're just starting to squeeze the trigger.
[01:49:49.873 --> 01:49:51.936]  Whispering in your ear how much they love you.
[01:49:54.233 --> 01:50:06.978]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:50:07.398 --> 01:50:14.101]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:50:14.501 --> 01:50:18.082]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:50:18.442 --> 01:50:21.643]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:50:21.843 --> 01:50:23.563]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:50:23.604 --> 01:50:29.345]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[01:50:29.745 --> 01:50:34.947]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:35.147 --> 01:50:43.869]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds
[01:50:46.288 --> 01:50:47.629]  It's Bar Information War.
[01:50:48.010 --> 01:50:48.931]  Truth is our weapon.
[01:50:49.191 --> 01:50:53.316]  And PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:50:54.028 --> 01:50:55.669]  America needs Ron Paul.
[01:50:55.809 --> 01:50:59.232]  There are numerous ways to show your support for him, and a better America.
[01:50:59.412 --> 01:51:03.314]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[01:51:03.494 --> 01:51:06.416]  That's why we have created RonPaulFlags.com.
[01:51:06.576 --> 01:51:14.542]  RonPaulFlags.com produces some of the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president of our ailing country.
[01:51:14.762 --> 01:51:20.626]  Standard flags are 3 feet by 5 feet, and custom flags can be as large as 30 feet by 50 feet.
[01:51:20.786 --> 01:51:23.848]  Our most popular flags are Ron Paul, president in Ohio.
[01:51:23.888 --> 01:51:24.548]  I think so.
[01:51:53.988 --> 01:51:54.649]  It's a fact.
[01:51:54.869 --> 01:52:02.335]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:52:02.455 --> 01:52:11.342]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:52:11.602 --> 01:52:22.150]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:52:22.410 --> 01:52:28.452]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:52:28.672 --> 01:52:33.693]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:52:33.873 --> 01:52:38.375]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:52:38.535 --> 01:52:40.335]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:52:40.375 --> 01:52:40.635]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:52:40.655 --> 01:52:41.195]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:52:41.275 --> 01:52:43.056]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:52:58.563 --> 01:53:01.685]  Eric, Mike, many others that are holding your calls are coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:01.766 --> 01:53:07.129]  I want to cover a bunch of financial news and other economic news around the world, some military news.
[01:53:07.169 --> 01:53:08.950]  It's all very important.
[01:53:11.512 --> 01:53:13.553]  But they really are federalizing local police.
[01:53:13.593 --> 01:53:14.254]  They really are.
[01:53:15.214 --> 01:53:18.336]  Training them now on the fact that our cell phones are lifetime track.
[01:53:18.677 --> 01:53:20.598]  That the cameras are scanning our license plates.
[01:53:21.118 --> 01:53:22.179]  All military designed.
[01:53:22.199 --> 01:53:25.782]  The military has been secretly working with the police for decades.
[01:53:26.482 --> 01:53:28.724]  Now they're converting the military over to foreign command.
[01:53:29.124 --> 01:53:30.245]  Foreigners and felons.
[01:53:31.006 --> 01:53:33.888]  The worst possible scenarios, but it's all incremental.
[01:53:34.828 --> 01:53:36.890]  All creeping death as they move against us.
[01:53:37.710 --> 01:53:39.712]  And the average troop on the ground, you know,
[01:53:40.954 --> 01:53:43.554]  He'll think he's actually helping people when he's gun confiscating.
[01:53:43.594 --> 01:53:45.175]  And, you know, there's a bio-release through.
[01:53:45.515 --> 01:53:46.715]  Al-Qaeda hit us again.
[01:53:47.995 --> 01:53:49.055]  It's the oldest thing in the book.
[01:53:49.095 --> 01:53:52.136]  Just the military comes in with private interest in control of it, and they take over.
[01:53:52.836 --> 01:53:53.496]  Bush Sr.'
[01:53:53.476 --> 01:53:56.737]  's father was the head Nazi.
[01:53:56.777 --> 01:53:57.357]  Tried to do it.
[01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:59.097]  Tried to hire the head of the Marine Corps to do it.
[01:53:59.917 --> 01:54:02.298]  Two-time Congressional Medal Honor winner, Smedley Butler.
[01:54:02.338 --> 01:54:03.458]  He went public and stopped them.
[01:54:04.178 --> 01:54:08.599]  But they've learned to not try to do it in one fell swoop with the 500,000-man team they had.
[01:54:09.259 --> 01:54:10.079]  They're going to do it slow.
[01:54:11.747 --> 01:54:21.489]  They're going to take the time, gutting us real good, and, uh, heaven help us.
[01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:26.170]  Man, I've got a lot of news here.
[01:54:26.190 --> 01:54:33.872]  I'm going to get into some more on Barack Obama, what he really stands for, more on the firing cribs, middle class may be subject to food rations, warns the U.N.
[01:54:34.252 --> 01:54:37.673]  Before we do that, uh, gold's up at $9.50 again today.
[01:54:39.904 --> 01:54:41.324]  Going between $9.45 and $9.50.
[01:54:41.465 --> 01:54:43.425]  It's stayed like that since last Friday.
[01:54:44.986 --> 01:54:47.386]  And that means it's a new mark for it.
[01:54:47.967 --> 01:54:51.548]  And the dollar went down even further as they print more money.
[01:54:53.368 --> 01:54:55.589]  And Ted said, you know, it's so soon.
[01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:56.489]  Should I come back on?
[01:54:56.529 --> 01:54:57.630]  I said, absolutely, Ted.
[01:54:58.310 --> 01:55:03.451]  I said, do you have any of the coins left at the price of a couple weeks ago that you purchased then when gold was $9.20?
[01:55:04.072 --> 01:55:05.372]  And he said, yeah, I'm almost out.
[01:55:05.925 --> 01:55:08.969]  So there's limited supplies, but here is Ted Anderson.
[01:55:08.989 --> 01:55:15.316]  Ted, you've got some of the Franks and some of the British Sovereigns left, right?
[01:55:15.396 --> 01:55:18.539]  Yeah, British Sovereigns at 254, the Franks are at 202.
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:23.725]  And one thing that's happened right now, too, is silver hit a peak and went through a psychological barrier when it hit over $18.
[01:55:23.785 --> 01:55:24.005]  Now it's $18.10.
[01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.729]  I don't know.
[01:55:47.503 --> 01:55:48.043]  I don't know.
[01:56:08.201 --> 01:56:10.002]  To buy foreign goods that we don't produce.
[01:56:10.042 --> 01:56:12.102]  There's really nothing left here in the United States.
[01:56:12.182 --> 01:56:18.004]  It's no surprise that the dollar is falling and that unemployment is going up and we have a train wreck going on economically.
[01:56:18.925 --> 01:56:20.265]  Look what we've done to ourselves.
[01:56:20.385 --> 01:56:21.186]  It's crazy.
[01:56:21.886 --> 01:56:22.326]  Crazy.
[01:56:22.366 --> 01:56:25.307]  We're going to do more, though, with Barack Obama and Hillary.
[01:56:25.347 --> 01:56:26.707]  Total socialized health care.
[01:56:27.268 --> 01:56:34.830]  That's like taking a sick patient and giving them cyanide and going, OK, this will make you feel better.
[01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:36.351]  It will, in a way.
[01:56:37.455 --> 01:56:37.835]  Die!
[01:56:38.656 --> 01:56:41.998]  Again, give them the number, Chad, and tell them about those three different coin deals.
[01:56:42.238 --> 01:56:45.840]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:50.883]  I'll say it again, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:56:50.923 --> 01:56:54.104]  For those of you who don't know, the British Sovereign is a quarter ounce gold piece.
[01:56:55.145 --> 01:56:58.587]  It currently, right now, is trading at $254 per coin.
[01:56:59.007 --> 01:57:01.388]  The Frank coin is a fifth of an ounce of gold, and it's at $202.
[01:57:02.964 --> 01:57:07.385]  And then the silver right now is $19 per face value.
[01:57:07.425 --> 01:57:08.365]  That's added up to $1.
[01:57:08.825 --> 01:57:10.566]  That's really a great buy, Alex.
[01:57:10.986 --> 01:57:12.566]  That silver is going nuts right now.
[01:57:12.646 --> 01:57:15.387]  Yeah, those are all three excellent deals.
[01:57:15.627 --> 01:57:17.187]  Give Ted Anderson a call at 800-686-2237.
[01:57:17.207 --> 01:57:17.267]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:57:17.287 --> 01:57:23.768]  And I had Ted up here because I believe in these metals and they're only going up and you need to get into them right now.
[01:57:34.684 --> 01:57:36.024]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:36.084 --> 01:57:39.627]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.507 --> 01:57:54.690]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.

[01:57:56.932 --> 01:57:57.813]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.833 --> 01:58:02.136]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.676 --> 01:58:06.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.163]  I'm going to cover news to the bottom of the hour for those that are holding.
[01:58:11.183 --> 01:58:12.524]  You want to hold fine?
[01:58:12.544 --> 01:58:14.005]  You want to get in line?
[01:58:14.025 --> 01:58:14.145]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:14.185 --> 01:58:18.749]  But I'm going to cover news to the bottom of the hour.
[01:58:21.039 --> 01:58:24.960]  Then I'm going to take your calls for the last 30 minutes, but I've got a lot of it here in front of me.
[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:27.920]  EU pulls out of northern Kosovo due to Serb resistance.
[01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:29.881]  Give you my take on that.
[01:58:29.981 --> 01:58:32.041]  Middle class may be subject to food rations.
[01:58:32.101 --> 01:58:33.041]  Warns UN.
[01:58:34.322 --> 01:58:35.742]  Here's Forbes today.
[01:58:38.903 --> 01:58:43.104]  Gold edges up towards record peaks on renewed inflation worries data.
[01:58:43.144 --> 01:58:45.184]  Gold edged up towards last week's record peaks.
[01:58:45.994 --> 01:58:47.516]  Now, here's what concerns me, Ted.
[01:58:47.556 --> 01:58:53.261]  You've been in this longer than I have, but, you know, I've immersed myself in it and I interview all the experts.
[01:59:12.859 --> 01:59:16.901]  I guess my opinion is worth two thimbles instead of one.
[01:59:17.941 --> 01:59:32.548]  But when I read about gold futures at $9.50, $9.60, $9.70, it always follows the futures, or almost always does, when I see gold mines having trouble keeping up with output, shutting down, breaking down from South Africa to Canada.
[01:59:33.009 --> 01:59:34.129]  This is what I'm seeing today.
[01:59:34.169 --> 01:59:35.870]  I did a lot of research today and last night.
[01:59:37.010 --> 01:59:37.671]  When I see
[01:59:39.316 --> 01:59:49.459]  That the big central banks have dumped a bunch of their gold, admittedly to drive down the price, because as gold goes up, that discredits their fiat currencies.
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:58.802]  I mean, the press is reporting record dumps of institutional and national gold reserves, and still gold is rising?
[01:59:59.623 --> 02:00:02.864]  That tells me that they can't control this anymore.
[02:00:03.524 --> 02:00:06.665]  I read last week about China went past our consumer
[02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:08.071]  We're good to go.
[02:00:28.624 --> 02:00:40.452]  Yeah, I would say that it would be, the chances of it going over $2,000 is better than it staying below $2,000, mainly because the dollar has fallen so far in value, and there's so many foreigners that are holding onto U.S.
[02:00:40.472 --> 02:00:41.753]  currency that want to get out of it.
[02:00:42.378 --> 02:00:45.599]  That there are any opportunity that they have to sell, they're doing it.
[02:00:46.099 --> 02:00:46.599]  And you're right.
[02:00:46.659 --> 02:00:52.861]  The central banks of the world are trying to keep the price of gold down because it discredits the currency that they're creating.
[02:00:52.881 --> 02:00:56.402]  Their fiat currencies take it on the chin every time gold goes up.
[02:00:56.442 --> 02:01:01.044]  It's like a reflection that they're doing bad and that the commodities are doing good.
[02:01:01.084 --> 02:01:02.444]  So they don't like to see that happen.
[02:01:02.824 --> 02:01:08.086]  And they are the largest holders of reserves because central banks know between each other they can't trade each other's currencies.
[02:01:08.446 --> 02:01:11.807]  They have to have something hard and tangible, and that's why they use gold.
[02:01:12.827 --> 02:01:22.472]  Data was suing the central banks because of the fact that they were artificially lowering the lease rates, which is what's used when you're trading futures.
[02:01:22.492 --> 02:01:28.635]  When you're buying gold into the future, and you're selling gold in the future, when you're selling short, you're actually selling the gold outright.
[02:01:28.975 --> 02:01:30.136]  But they're doing all of that.
[02:01:30.156 --> 02:01:33.218]  They're playing all their tricks of selling it to each other under cost.
[02:01:33.518 --> 02:01:34.958]  It's not working anymore, Ted.
[02:01:35.078 --> 02:01:35.699]  No, it's not.
[02:01:35.759 --> 02:01:41.001]  That's because their currencies are falling too fast, and the rest of the world is going, hey, you go ahead and dump it.
[02:01:41.021 --> 02:01:42.022]  We're going to take care of it.
[02:01:42.382 --> 02:01:47.865]  Well, even three years ago, two years ago, the media was saying, don't be a cook, don't buy gold, something that's doubled.
[02:01:48.685 --> 02:01:49.945]  How much is gold up now since 2000?
[02:01:50.025 --> 02:01:51.606]  Well, if you go from 200... 140%?
[02:01:52.266 --> 02:01:58.549]  248, 250 an ounce, and then you get up to right now, we're right around 950, so you can do the math.
[02:01:58.829 --> 02:02:00.070]  It's almost up three times.
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:02.301]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:02:13.479 --> 02:02:17.902]  I think if the news said gold didn't exist, the know-it-all yuppies wouldn't believe it.
[02:02:18.322 --> 02:02:20.323]  No.
[02:02:20.403 --> 02:02:22.244]  They're still dreaming right now.
[02:02:22.624 --> 02:02:24.525]  They just need to get involved.
[02:02:24.945 --> 02:02:27.407]  If you're looking at wanting to get into the gold course... 800-686-2237.
[02:02:27.427 --> 02:02:27.467]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:27.487 --> 02:02:27.527]  800-686-2237.
[02:02:27.547 --> 02:02:28.107]  Thanks, Ted.
[02:02:28.147 --> 02:02:29.588]  Thanks a lot for having me up, Alex.
[02:02:29.608 --> 02:02:32.069]  Folks, I'm just trying to get you in on something good.
[02:02:41.507 --> 02:02:44.909]  While we talk about the financial news for the day, we'll be back with the food rationing.
[02:02:46.590 --> 02:02:48.291]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:02:48.611 --> 02:02:52.073]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:02:52.213 --> 02:02:54.515]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:02:54.675 --> 02:02:57.436]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:02:57.756 --> 02:03:03.260]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:07.482]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:03:07.782 --> 02:03:12.726]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:04:46.938 --> 02:04:51.040]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp.
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:52.561]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:04:56.943 --> 02:05:01.365]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:05:01.385 --> 02:05:03.826]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:05:04.187 --> 02:05:05.247]  They keep you down.
[02:05:05.427 --> 02:05:06.328]  They keep you blue.
[02:05:06.608 --> 02:05:09.529]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:13.631]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:05:14.011 --> 02:05:19.374]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:05:21.275 --> 02:05:25.838]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:05:25.858 --> 02:05:30.080]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:35.583]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:05:35.643 --> 02:05:40.105]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:05:40.145 --> 02:05:42.266]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[02:05:42.366 --> 02:05:43.147]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:05:47.535 --> 02:05:53.560]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:57.223]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:13.716]  From the heart of Serbia and their capital of Belgrade, the capital of the breakaway Republic of Kosovo, the police stations, everything is burning.
[02:06:14.858 --> 02:06:15.378]  The U.N.
[02:06:15.418 --> 02:06:16.959]  and NATO flee cowardly.
[02:06:17.359 --> 02:06:19.540]  They're only there to rape children and use drugs.
[02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:20.320]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:21.501]  The U.N.
[02:06:21.601 --> 02:06:24.902]  force, everywhere they go, is caught running child kidnapping rings.
[02:06:24.922 --> 02:06:25.622]  That's what they do.
[02:06:25.942 --> 02:06:27.163]  Pedophiles go and join that.
[02:06:28.463 --> 02:06:29.944]  And then inject heroin.
[02:06:30.304 --> 02:06:33.065]  They're just lazy, scum, coward filth.
[02:06:33.726 --> 02:06:34.246]  Literally.
[02:06:35.226 --> 02:06:35.646]  Believe me.
[02:06:35.666 --> 02:06:37.387]  And it's been in the news thousands of times.
[02:06:37.407 --> 02:06:38.968]  Just go Google U.N.
[02:06:39.008 --> 02:06:42.209]  child kidnapping, child prostitution, drug use.
[02:06:44.486 --> 02:06:49.430]  It's just basically social workers that go from being social workers here that just say, look, I just want to murder people.
[02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:55.234]  And they get little kids almost every night and beat them to death, and, you know, the photos of all that's been out.
[02:06:55.275 --> 02:07:00.859]  I mean, the UN ran the Rwandan massacre in 94, and that's now come out.
[02:07:00.899 --> 02:07:02.660]  They didn't just, quote, accidentally let it happen.
[02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:04.241]  They ran the whole operation.
[02:07:05.923 --> 02:07:09.706]  EU pulls out of northern Kosovo due to Serb resistance.
[02:07:12.142 --> 02:07:24.108]  And so the bottom line here is we had over 600 cities in what, four or five states, I think it grew, that threw out the Patriot Act and said it was unconstitutional and said they wouldn't accept martial law.
[02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:28.230]  I remember coming up with the idea for you to do that.
[02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:30.971]  Groups did form, you did do that, you took action.
[02:07:31.531 --> 02:07:32.912]  Austin led in that fight.
[02:07:34.492 --> 02:07:39.595]  That's covered in Matrix of Evil, by the way, one of my films, excellent, now on DVD.
[02:07:41.764 --> 02:07:45.025]  And, Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney are in it.
[02:07:46.286 --> 02:07:48.066]  And so we have to go to our city councils.
[02:07:48.086 --> 02:07:54.368]  We have to, as citizens, ask for tours of the local, you know, FEMA Threat Integration Center.
[02:07:54.968 --> 02:07:58.710]  On the news they call it the Traffic Monitoring Emergency Center.
[02:07:59.390 --> 02:08:00.910]  It's all federally paid for and run.
[02:08:00.930 --> 02:08:08.753]  There's usually a CIA liaison in there, FBI liaison, all federalizing the face scanning, the license plate scanning.
[02:08:09.548 --> 02:08:10.869]  That's their control grid.
[02:08:10.889 --> 02:08:13.230]  You want to find out about how far FEMA is in your area?
[02:08:13.690 --> 02:08:14.411]  Get involved!
[02:08:14.551 --> 02:08:15.391]  You're a city leader.
[02:08:15.431 --> 02:08:16.412]  You're a business owner.
[02:08:16.832 --> 02:08:17.792]  Ask for a tour of it.
[02:08:20.434 --> 02:08:21.974]  Tell them you're interested in volunteering.
[02:08:22.635 --> 02:08:24.736]  We've always got citizen tattletale groups.
[02:08:25.836 --> 02:08:26.717]  Go infiltrate them!
[02:08:30.129 --> 02:08:35.813]  And then take the info you've got, bring it before the City Council, point out that mainstream news is reporting it's for martial law.
[02:08:36.113 --> 02:08:38.234]  They'll laugh at you, even though they know it's true.
[02:08:38.294 --> 02:08:39.735]  Some cities, though, will take action.
[02:08:40.296 --> 02:08:42.997]  And then that keeps them from running this covert op.
[02:08:43.818 --> 02:08:45.759]  NORTHCOM can only run this covert op.
[02:08:45.819 --> 02:08:48.681]  They said they're going to federalize the counties, the cities, the states.
[02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:49.862]  They've already done that.
[02:08:52.023 --> 02:08:56.866]  And they do plan on using predominantly Latin American troops here in the U.S., actually, ruling over us.
[02:08:56.926 --> 02:08:57.647]  It's so sick.
[02:08:58.979 --> 02:09:01.781]  Well, just expose that, and then it's over for them.
[02:09:02.682 --> 02:09:04.903]  They can't handle exposure.
[02:09:08.966 --> 02:09:15.710]  So, if you've been an establishment type who's heard this show in the past, isn't it time for you now to admit we told you the truth?
[02:09:16.531 --> 02:09:21.134]  Isn't it time for you now to admit you know what's really happening, and to do something about it?
[02:09:21.174 --> 02:09:22.795]  I mean, is it good to have our military
[02:09:24.694 --> 02:09:27.995]  More and more becoming a bunch of illegal aliens and aggravated felons, or both?
[02:09:28.035 --> 02:09:34.837]  I mean, is it good to have deals signed with Mexico and Canada to use their military here to, quote, suppress American terrorists?
[02:09:34.937 --> 02:09:36.058]  You know, that's us fighting back.
[02:09:36.098 --> 02:09:37.658]  You don't give them your farm, you're a terrorist.
[02:09:38.298 --> 02:09:40.979]  I mean, is that something you really like?
[02:09:41.439 --> 02:09:42.320]  Amnesty's real.
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:44.040]  The open borders are real.
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:47.161]  The fact that illegal aliens are above the law, that's real.
[02:09:47.381 --> 02:09:50.122]  And again, that just proves this is all about control of the citizens.
[02:09:53.447 --> 02:09:55.128]  But forget those that haven't woken up yet.
[02:09:55.308 --> 02:09:57.750]  If they don't want to figure out what's happening, that's their business.
[02:09:58.230 --> 02:10:05.314]  You, that are awake out there, instead of factionalizing or being part of some subgroup, you need to get in the streets.
[02:10:05.354 --> 02:10:06.615]  You need to start organizations.
[02:10:06.635 --> 02:10:08.936]  You need to take on things locally.
[02:10:10.877 --> 02:10:16.820]  You need to get together with friends and suit and ties and put reports together and bring it down to your mayor, bring it down to your police chief.
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:19.542]  I remember going to the head of the Travis County SWAT team.
[02:10:20.202 --> 02:10:22.844]  He sent some guys over to threaten me one time.
[02:10:24.932 --> 02:10:26.973]  And then I went over to his office and I said, I want to meet with you.
[02:10:27.753 --> 02:10:30.434]  And I said, you're going to have Delta Force come in here and try to bribe you.
[02:10:30.474 --> 02:10:32.995]  And he said, oh, I'm a Marine from Vietnam, sniper.
[02:10:33.315 --> 02:10:34.255]  The military's good.
[02:10:34.295 --> 02:10:36.036]  There's no secret police or military.
[02:10:36.056 --> 02:10:39.117]  About a year later, he called me up to his office one time.
[02:10:39.157 --> 02:10:39.818]  He said, please come in here.
[02:10:39.838 --> 02:10:41.158]  And he said, here's the Delta Force card.
[02:10:41.558 --> 02:10:42.639]  Everything you said is true.
[02:10:42.699 --> 02:10:43.459]  How did you know this?
[02:10:44.279 --> 02:10:46.220]  And he goes, and he wasn't playing good cop, bad cop.
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:48.901]  He really was freaked out because they fired him about a month later.
[02:10:53.894 --> 02:10:54.554]  How did I know?
[02:10:54.574 --> 02:10:55.615]  I have the documents.
[02:10:58.956 --> 02:11:01.196]  Look, this is an evil government, okay?
[02:11:05.778 --> 02:11:11.139]  They admit that they put poison in our water and poison in our food.
[02:11:11.339 --> 02:11:11.999]  That's admitted.
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:15.140]  They admit that they torture children sexually in front of their parents.
[02:11:15.561 --> 02:11:16.601]  That's not good.
[02:11:16.741 --> 02:11:21.662]  I can't believe I have to explain to people that work for the government that that's not okay.
[02:11:22.143 --> 02:11:23.563]  That is not good.
[02:11:25.083 --> 02:11:29.109]  Now, the military-industrial complex has built up this big apparatus of tyranny.
[02:11:29.469 --> 02:11:32.433]  Now they plan to bring in Barack Obama or Hillary or whoever it's going to be.
[02:11:32.453 --> 02:11:36.779]  And then, oh, it's a new change of guard, but the whole infrastructure continues.
[02:11:37.159 --> 02:11:42.246]  And then suddenly the left that's all freaked out about this, because they're worried about George Bush, they all go to sleep.
[02:11:46.249 --> 02:11:49.692]  But the New World Order's got its bases in Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe.
[02:11:50.173 --> 02:11:55.658]  The New World Order's got its police state set up, and we get hit by terrorists again, and then it's off to the races.
[02:11:59.701 --> 02:12:05.607]  Now, the globalists aren't going to be able to continue to carry this stuff out, though, if we expose government-sponsored terror, which we've done.
[02:12:05.907 --> 02:12:07.909]  So that's hard for them to use that tool now.
[02:12:10.251 --> 02:12:21.213]  A lot of people who are compartmentalized in the military, in intelligence, in the FBI, in the CIA, who laughed at us years ago, now they double-take and they say, how do you know all this classified stuff?
[02:12:21.253 --> 02:12:23.294]  How did you understand how I was compartmentalized?
[02:12:23.534 --> 02:12:24.514]  Because I've studied history.
[02:12:25.534 --> 02:12:31.135]  Now they're beginning to look over their compartments and they're seeing the bigger picture and they're going, my God, it's true!
[02:12:34.076 --> 02:12:35.176]  We're the bad guys!
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:37.201]  And that doesn't mean I'm a bad guy.
[02:12:37.221 --> 02:12:38.522]  That doesn't mean you're a bad guy.
[02:12:38.822 --> 02:12:42.044]  It means the people steering the ship are bad.
[02:12:42.445 --> 02:12:43.686]  See, a country's like a ship.
[02:12:44.646 --> 02:12:46.367]  And so Bush says, support the military.
[02:12:46.608 --> 02:12:47.628]  You don't support our military.
[02:12:48.209 --> 02:12:48.549]  No.
[02:12:48.569 --> 02:12:50.771]  The military's a ship.
[02:12:51.511 --> 02:12:52.292]  That's the analogy.
[02:12:52.372 --> 02:12:54.073]  I don't support who's piloting it.
[02:12:54.553 --> 02:12:56.014]  It's like a bulldozer.
[02:12:56.054 --> 02:13:04.220]  It can work great for digging stuff up and making structures and preparing foundations or moving rubble out of the way, but it can also tear your house down.
[02:13:04.855 --> 02:13:10.498]  Or some kid gets on one with a key and starts it up and runs it through three houses.
[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:16.321]  I'm against how this whole mechanism is being used.
[02:13:16.662 --> 02:13:18.383]  But see, they talk to the public like they're little kids.
[02:13:18.723 --> 02:13:22.085]  Either you support whatever the government's doing with the military, or you don't support the military.
[02:13:24.046 --> 02:13:25.086]  I mean, that's illogical.
[02:13:28.388 --> 02:13:29.268]  Totally illogical.
[02:13:29.289 --> 02:13:33.711]  Alright, let me just get in the news here, but I wanted to make that point.
[02:13:35.822 --> 02:13:38.184]  This is all done through compartmentalization.
[02:13:38.224 --> 02:13:39.524]  I keep hammering on that.
[02:13:40.685 --> 02:13:42.586]  Don't believe me, police that are listening.
[02:13:43.287 --> 02:13:47.829]  Find out there's no law to take vaccines, and then ask why the news says it's the law you've got to take them.
[02:13:50.171 --> 02:13:56.215]  Find out that there's government documents where they knew sodium fluoride would brain damage you, and they put it in the water to dumb you down.
[02:13:57.175 --> 02:13:59.357]  Then go find it out for yourself.
[02:13:59.417 --> 02:13:59.957]  It's everywhere.
[02:14:02.539 --> 02:14:03.659]  Find out this is real.
[02:14:03.739 --> 02:14:04.980]  Find out you're under attack.
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:08.060]  Find out for yourself that you're being used.
[02:14:13.682 --> 02:14:17.723]  Middle class may be subject to food rations warns UN.
[02:14:17.743 --> 02:14:26.865]  The UN is warning of a food shortage crisis and drawing up plans for food rations which will hit even middle class suburban populations.
[02:14:28.875 --> 02:14:34.840]  As inflation and economic uncertainty causes the prices of stable food commodities to skyrocket.
[02:14:35.561 --> 02:14:41.065]  And see, what the government's going to do is, they're going to come in and not let you buy the food if you've got the money.
[02:14:41.525 --> 02:14:42.626]  They're going to price-fix.
[02:14:42.666 --> 02:14:43.527]  They always do this.
[02:14:44.528 --> 02:14:57.318]  And then they're going to say, but because we've lowered prices, or kept them the same, and done price-fixing, now there's limited food, and so even if you've got the money, you can't get it.
[02:14:57.961 --> 02:15:02.242]  The United Nations World Food Program cautions today that it doesn't receive more funding.
[02:15:03.042 --> 02:15:08.963]  Again, the globalists are behind getting farmers off the land, squeezing them out, big agri-controlling it, GMO.
[02:15:09.603 --> 02:15:12.884]  It will have to halt food aid to developing countries like Mexico and China.
[02:15:13.944 --> 02:15:18.485]  The WFP critics, they only ship you GMO food anyway, so who wants it?
[02:15:18.525 --> 02:15:20.286]  We pay for it with tax money and they ship it down there.
[02:15:20.746 --> 02:15:22.246]  The WFP critics talks
[02:15:23.337 --> 02:15:36.504]  Come as the body sees the emergence of the new era of hunger, their quote, in developing countries, where even middle-class urban people are being priced out of the food market because of rising food prices, reports the Financial Times.
[02:15:37.185 --> 02:15:50.412]  The warning coincides with a speech by William Lapp, a U.S.-based consultancy, Advanced Economic Solutions, who cautions that rising agricultural raw material prices would translate this year into sharply higher food inflation.
[02:15:51.078 --> 02:15:53.142]  Yeah, we saw 20% last year.
[02:15:53.162 --> 02:15:55.146]  They're talking about 40% this year.
[02:15:55.166 --> 02:15:59.916]  I mean, have you noticed that something that was $6 at a little corner dive is now $12?
[02:16:02.853 --> 02:16:03.574]  With the U.S.
[02:16:03.634 --> 02:16:21.385]  on the verge of recession, and as many analysts have warned, a potential second Great Depression, those long scoffed at for hoarding vast quantities of storable food may unfortunately be able to stay, to say, I told you so, if the dollar continues to deteriorate and people begin to be priced out of the food market.
[02:16:22.786 --> 02:16:27.209]  Global food prices have skyrocketed by as much as 60% in the past year.
[02:16:27.509 --> 02:16:28.990]  Paul gives a mainstream link.
[02:16:29.370 --> 02:16:32.292]  Yeah, it's 60% globally, but
[02:16:33.438 --> 02:16:36.219]  20 to 30 percent, depending on what number you look at, in the US.
[02:16:36.679 --> 02:16:38.319]  People email me and say, which is it?
[02:16:38.519 --> 02:16:39.059]  Is it 20?
[02:16:39.099 --> 02:16:39.639]  Is it 30?
[02:16:39.679 --> 02:16:40.199]  Is it 60?
[02:16:41.099 --> 02:16:45.500]  In the US, it's 20 or 30 percent, depending on, there's a bunch of different numbers, so you can pick your numbers.
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:46.280]  We just know it's up.
[02:16:46.981 --> 02:16:48.421]  And yeah, it's 60 percent worldwide.
[02:16:50.241 --> 02:17:00.443]  While UN officials warn of likelihood of food riots, if prices continue to rise, I would not be surprised if we begin to see food riots, said Jacques Diouf,
[02:17:01.266 --> 02:17:05.089]  Director General of the UN's Food Agriculture Organization last October.
[02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:11.353]  Hey, Paul Watson, you need to add something to this article.
[02:17:11.673 --> 02:17:26.103]  1997 Population Summit, might have been 96, I'm going from memory, in Beijing, China, the head of the UN Food Program said, we use, we do, we can and do use food as a weapon, and I suggest we use it more often,
[02:17:26.849 --> 02:17:28.310]  We do not apologize for that.
[02:17:28.370 --> 02:17:29.690]  That's basically the exact quote.
[02:17:30.211 --> 02:17:31.851]  It's a woman, I forget her first name.
[02:17:32.372 --> 02:17:33.572]  She said it on television.
[02:17:34.153 --> 02:17:34.453]  Okay?
[02:17:34.473 --> 02:17:40.956]  So, you need to add to this that the UN uses food as a weapon, so people know they're not the good guy when they're reading this.
[02:17:46.799 --> 02:17:48.219]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:50.320]  A new world order.
[02:17:51.041 --> 02:17:55.303]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power called God.
[02:17:56.945 --> 02:18:03.987]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.727 --> 02:18:12.069]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:15.066 --> 02:18:20.048]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.548 --> 02:18:23.989]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.369 --> 02:18:26.870]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:27.930]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:28.890]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.910 --> 02:18:29.991]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:30.171 --> 02:18:30.931]  They're after power.
[02:18:31.151 --> 02:18:31.991]  That's what happens here.

[02:18:40.614 --> 02:18:43.395]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:18:43.837 --> 02:18:44.907]  You have been warned.
[02:18:45.842 --> 02:18:47.683]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:18:47.904 --> 02:18:50.946]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:18:51.186 --> 02:18:55.809]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:18:56.149 --> 02:18:58.771]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:18:59.132 --> 02:19:03.915]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:05.896]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:19:06.116 --> 02:19:11.841]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:19:12.201 --> 02:19:13.802]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:19:14.102 --> 02:19:18.085]  Yes, SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:19:18.525 --> 02:19:29.534]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.

[02:22:04.947 --> 02:22:08.428]  And 24 hours a day on the internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:08.468 --> 02:22:11.029]  And the live show ends in about 35 minutes.
[02:22:11.069 --> 02:22:16.390]  It just restarts at InfoWars.com if you missed any of the first or second hour.
[02:22:18.723 --> 02:22:21.404]  Alright, here's the type of news I have on the education front.
[02:22:21.484 --> 02:22:23.684]  Homeschooled Germans flee to the UK.
[02:22:24.305 --> 02:22:31.347]  London Guardian, a 1938 law designed to ensure state control of all children, has provoked a family exodus to Britain.
[02:22:32.427 --> 02:22:34.248]  This is the London Guardian, not Alex Jones.
[02:22:34.288 --> 02:22:37.068]  Of course, we told you this stuff all came out of Germany and England.
[02:22:37.509 --> 02:22:45.531]  Families are fleeing to the UK from Germany to escape a law introduced by Hitler that could lead to their children being taken into care if educated at home.
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:52.722]  And it goes on to say that the 70-year-old law has caused hundreds of refugees to exit just in the month of October.
[02:22:52.742 --> 02:22:58.923]  And it goes on to say homeschooling has been illegal in Germany since it was outlawed in 1938.
[02:22:59.003 --> 02:23:02.744]  Hitler wanted the Nazi state to have complete control over the young minds.
[02:23:03.124 --> 02:23:08.286]  Today there are rare exceptions, such as four children suffering serious illnesses or psychological problems.
[02:23:08.926 --> 02:23:13.947]  Legal attempts through the courts, including the European Union of Human Rights, have so far failed to overturn the ban.
[02:23:14.427 --> 02:23:16.248]  What do you mean the EU pushes for that?
[02:23:16.889 --> 02:23:20.613]  And California, Illinois, they've tried to ban homeschooling here in the U.S.
[02:23:20.633 --> 02:23:27.058]  Because they're not a bunch of Prozac Ritalin heads, you know, running around like a bunch of monkey whores.
[02:23:27.679 --> 02:23:28.480]  That's what they want.
[02:23:30.962 --> 02:23:33.084]  And they're trying to go after it right here in the U.S.
[02:23:33.184 --> 02:23:40.671]  Again, modern education started 200 years ago in Germany, when Prussia was losing out to Napoleon.
[02:23:42.887 --> 02:23:44.909]  And then people say, well, which is, the British or the Germans?
[02:23:44.949 --> 02:23:46.431]  Well, they were all interlocked.
[02:23:46.971 --> 02:23:47.912]  You know, the sciences.
[02:23:47.972 --> 02:23:48.613]  The Ph.D.
[02:23:48.633 --> 02:23:49.433]  started in Germany.
[02:23:51.015 --> 02:23:54.759]  And the textbooks were all written, and they've been written right through the last year.
[02:23:54.999 --> 02:23:58.582]  They just say, they've dumbed us down by design, and it's official.
[02:24:01.425 --> 02:24:03.627]  Now, again, the teacher on the ground doesn't know that.
[02:24:03.647 --> 02:24:03.967]  They just...
[02:24:05.447 --> 02:24:14.214]  When you read government documents a hundred years old about how they were going to have six periods a day so you could never focus or think and to confuse you, I mean, they've done a good job.
[02:24:14.254 --> 02:24:15.415]  The public's a bunch of idiots.
[02:24:16.356 --> 02:24:19.859]  And then with television, the average attention span's about three minutes long.
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:22.140]  You can't talk to adults.
[02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:24.502]  They can't stand up and be free or be successful.
[02:24:25.223 --> 02:24:26.344]  All they can do is act cool.
[02:24:27.176 --> 02:24:33.759]  They're just in like imaginary playland, like a three-year-old, you know, acts like they're Robin Hood or Cowboys or Indians.
[02:24:33.779 --> 02:24:34.620]  Well, adults do that.
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:38.942]  They just walk around acting cool, just, uh, uh, I'm so cool, uh, uh, I'm so cool.
[02:24:39.142 --> 02:24:42.183]  They all wear little different costumes, different little cliques and clubs.
[02:24:44.524 --> 02:24:47.046]  Homeschooled Germans flee to UK in 1938 law.
[02:24:47.126 --> 02:24:49.107]  It's just London Guardian, you know.
[02:24:51.138 --> 02:24:51.318]  U.N.
[02:24:51.338 --> 02:24:52.579]  propaganda aimed at U.S.
[02:24:52.619 --> 02:24:53.320]  school children.
[02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:58.925]  I just wanted to expand on that because they said they want to give every American school child a U.N.
[02:24:58.965 --> 02:25:00.206]  comic book about how the U.N.'
[02:25:00.186 --> 02:25:00.506]  's good.
[02:25:00.987 --> 02:25:08.173]  Doctors and teachers to act as informers to target violent offenders before they strike under controversial minority report plans.
[02:25:08.753 --> 02:25:16.640]  Doctors, teachers, and social workers will be told to act as informers to identify potentially violent offenders for monitoring by the police and other agencies.
[02:25:17.296 --> 02:25:28.059]  Ministers help spotting binge drinkers, drug addicts, and young gang members early before they commit serious crimes, that they can be placed on national database and steered away from offending behavior.
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:30.540]  Now this is in endgame.
[02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:31.561]  Mainstream news.
[02:25:31.661 --> 02:25:34.662]  Toddlers are being put on probation for their genetics.
[02:25:34.702 --> 02:25:39.383]  They're claiming if your parents were bad, that means you have a genetic pre-distribution.
[02:25:40.583 --> 02:25:41.044]  What's the word?
[02:25:41.124 --> 02:25:44.225]  Pre... I'm suddenly having one of those moments today.
[02:25:46.482 --> 02:25:48.043]  You're predisposed to do it.
[02:25:49.484 --> 02:26:01.312]  The plans have been dubbed the Minority Report Powers in reference to the 2002 Tom Cruise movie in which futuristic preemptive police units use psychics to arrest and imprison criminals before they carry out attacks.
[02:26:01.613 --> 02:26:02.773]  That's the Daily Mail.
[02:26:07.837 --> 02:26:08.157]  Why not?
[02:26:08.197 --> 02:26:09.178]  We have preemptive war.
[02:26:09.218 --> 02:26:10.299]  There is some good news.
[02:26:10.359 --> 02:26:16.203]  Now, remember, I saw this eight years ago in Tennessee and since then hundreds of newspaper articles about similar stuff.
[02:26:16.883 --> 02:26:23.792]  The girls from the local team come over and they're showering and they're 8th graders, 7th and 8th graders.
[02:26:24.372 --> 02:26:31.842]  They're showering after the basketball game before they get dressed and go get picked up by their parents and they freak out because the video camera is in the stalls.
[02:26:32.322 --> 02:26:35.967]  Now that's normal in the big communal shower area to see a camera and freak out.
[02:26:38.229 --> 02:26:42.153]  But the principal had announced it there, and so the parents had been brainwashed.
[02:26:42.193 --> 02:26:46.918]  If an authority figure says it's okay, then videotaping your naked daughter is alright.
[02:26:48.039 --> 02:26:48.439]  You see.
[02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:54.005]  But the visiting team hadn't been told it was the gods yet that it said they had to do this.
[02:26:55.106 --> 02:27:01.973]  And so, uh, they freaked out, literally ran out screaming with towels around them, police were called, and then the, uh,
[02:27:03.402 --> 02:27:04.883]  Police Chief and everybody, we're on the news.
[02:27:05.244 --> 02:27:07.165]  It was in the local papers in Tennessee.
[02:27:07.525 --> 02:27:09.527]  They said, well, it's normal to have cameras in the bathrooms.
[02:27:10.308 --> 02:27:10.968]  Well, here it is.
[02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:17.133]  School removes CCTV cameras from children's toilets after furious protests from parents.
[02:27:18.654 --> 02:27:21.096]  I've had this story since Friday, but I haven't gotten to it yet.
[02:27:21.116 --> 02:27:26.901]  I'm going to cover this when we get back, blitz through some other news, jam in some of your calls, and a lot more.
[02:27:26.961 --> 02:27:28.983]  And we've got a little treat coming up, an interesting clip.
[02:27:29.863 --> 02:27:31.985]  So you'll want to stay with us here.
[02:27:32.265 --> 02:27:32.886]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.559 --> 02:27:39.542]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.483 --> 02:27:43.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.650 --> 02:27:50.911]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:27:51.171 --> 02:27:56.073]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:27:56.273 --> 02:27:57.593]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[02:31:00.180 --> 02:31:28.083]  A front porch sittin' in an old rockin' chair The sun is hot in the Texas sky A garden growin', clothes out on a line A dusty road when a car goes by A story tellin' of days long ago
[02:31:30.726 --> 02:31:33.067]  And the only place she'd ever get.
[02:31:36.809 --> 02:31:41.351]  Singing softly, this world was not my home.
[02:31:42.932 --> 02:31:45.133]  And memories take me back again.
[02:31:47.455 --> 02:31:51.337]  When I was young and Grandma wasn't home.
[02:31:53.698 --> 02:31:57.760]  When she guided me as I watched life unfold.
[02:32:00.190 --> 02:32:13.172]  Yeah, that's off Willie Nelson's new album.
[02:32:15.713 --> 02:32:16.533]  Moment of forever.
[02:32:19.873 --> 02:32:27.255]  Yeah, Willie Nelson's daughter got asked by architects and engineers from 9-11 Truth at an event if she agreed with her dad and thought it was an inside job.
[02:32:27.275 --> 02:32:28.055]  She said yes.
[02:32:28.095 --> 02:32:29.015]  There's photos of that up.
[02:32:30.183 --> 02:32:35.006]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, it originates from 911blogger.com.
[02:32:36.607 --> 02:32:38.108]  So that's interesting to have that happening.
[02:32:39.729 --> 02:32:55.679]  Also, the local News 8 reported that the UT police this weekend on Saturday said that more than 4,000 people came out for a Ron Paul event.
[02:32:56.339 --> 02:32:57.640]  That was just at the main mall.
[02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:59.541]  They were in the two malls beside that.
[02:33:00.825 --> 02:33:05.508]  The Libertarian blog, Lou Rockwell, is reporting 7,000.
[02:33:05.588 --> 02:33:14.672]  We've got photos of this, and when you're on the stage and you can't get the whole crowd in the photo, it was probably closer to 7,000 than 4,000.
[02:33:15.772 --> 02:33:17.533]  I wish I could have gone, but I've just been so busy.
[02:33:17.573 --> 02:33:18.534]  I was spending time with family.
[02:33:19.074 --> 02:33:27.238]  I was spending time with family downtown, and I saw Kat Anderson and the Ron Paul Air Corps flying really low with that huge banner.
[02:33:28.115 --> 02:33:32.683]  Look, if we can take those 7,000 people that were there and don't go join one organization.
[02:33:34.566 --> 02:33:38.732]  But most of those people said they were from Austin or from UT.
[02:33:39.938 --> 02:33:42.078]  What if you all get together and start organizations?
[02:33:42.139 --> 02:33:54.061]  What if you go to the UT City Council and say, we don't want martial law, we know the feds have put in a command center, we know you're using face scanning cameras, we know you've got microphones up around town, we don't want red light cameras.
[02:33:54.561 --> 02:33:59.642]  I mean, 4,000 people start giving money politically, start running for office, start protesting, it's over!
[02:33:59.982 --> 02:34:02.803]  Those 4,000, and it's more like, I think it was 7,000.
[02:34:02.843 --> 02:34:04.223]  UT Police said more than 4,000.
[02:34:04.303 --> 02:34:04.663]  On the news.
[02:34:08.012 --> 02:34:10.334]  And we've had a thousand people and they call it a hundred.
[02:34:10.515 --> 02:34:11.656]  So, you know.
[02:34:12.777 --> 02:34:15.499]  What if we took those people, what if you form other groups?
[02:34:15.539 --> 02:34:27.691]  Just make sure you get together, make sure that you talk to everybody, make sure you join a second amendment group, a control the border group, a anti-new, start websites, start news sites.
[02:34:30.174 --> 02:34:31.595]  You know, make sure you do that.
[02:34:33.792 --> 02:34:36.434]  Now, also make sure you don't come to me and tell me what to do, though.
[02:34:36.874 --> 02:34:39.376]  I'm just recommending you start your own organization, your own group.
[02:34:40.077 --> 02:34:41.298]  And that's just Austin, Texas.
[02:34:41.318 --> 02:34:44.600]  You know, Ron Paul's spoken to 5,000, 6,000 people in Minneapolis.
[02:34:45.101 --> 02:34:48.923]  He's spoken to 5,000, 6,000 people in L.A., in New York.
[02:34:48.963 --> 02:34:51.826]  I mean, everywhere he goes, he's getting crowds of over a couple thousand.
[02:34:52.046 --> 02:34:52.986]  They're getting bigger.
[02:34:53.327 --> 02:34:54.648]  Of course there's election fraud.
[02:34:54.688 --> 02:34:55.728]  Of course they've cheated him.
[02:34:56.349 --> 02:34:58.310]  He's getting crowds as big as Barack Obama?
[02:34:59.291 --> 02:35:01.133]  Before Obama was even getting those crowds?
[02:35:01.613 --> 02:35:03.034]  That translates into real votes.
[02:35:04.475 --> 02:35:05.555]  7,000 people.
[02:35:06.016 --> 02:35:06.976]  I'm already digressing.
[02:35:07.517 --> 02:35:11.840]  Photos are going up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next 10-15 minutes.
[02:35:12.441 --> 02:35:18.185]  Amanda and Tim wrote a story together and that's going up about it.
[02:35:18.245 --> 02:35:23.810]  Just hopefully get that out and hopefully, you know, add the points there that we need to organize and get together now.
[02:35:26.385 --> 02:35:27.126]  We're good to go.
[02:35:50.236 --> 02:35:50.536]  You know what?
[02:35:50.556 --> 02:35:52.156]  I'm going to play this Michael McNair clip.
[02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:53.937]  I've said this myself many times.
[02:35:54.297 --> 02:35:55.537]  The Founding Fathers said this.
[02:35:55.557 --> 02:35:57.137]  This has been said a million different ways.
[02:35:57.977 --> 02:36:00.878]  But we posted this video up on InfoWars.com.
[02:36:01.518 --> 02:36:03.658]  I forgot the title to it in case folks want to search it.
[02:36:03.678 --> 02:36:04.739]  What's the title name, John?
[02:36:06.919 --> 02:36:07.839]  Oh, you didn't say the title.
[02:36:07.879 --> 02:36:08.579]  I sent it to you Friday.
[02:36:08.619 --> 02:36:09.300]  I forget the title.
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:14.741]  But I'll remember the title while it's playing.
[02:36:15.501 --> 02:36:17.061]  And this is him in a classroom setting.
[02:36:18.095 --> 02:36:19.897]  Let me give you a little commentary on the Holocaust.
[02:36:19.917 --> 02:36:23.299]  The Holocaust is generally deemed to be the worst travesty in human history.
[02:36:43.803 --> 02:36:45.244]  Five or six million Jews.
[02:36:45.304 --> 02:36:50.527]  I don't know what the actual count was, but it was a lot of people.
[02:36:50.888 --> 02:36:52.008]  They did a genocide.
[02:36:52.048 --> 02:36:54.610]  They tried to wipe out an entire race.
[02:36:56.291 --> 02:36:59.553]  Hitler did not take Germany by force.
[02:36:59.573 --> 02:37:01.955]  He did not drive in with army tanks.
[02:37:03.415 --> 02:37:04.596]  Hitler was elected.
[02:37:05.657 --> 02:37:08.259]  Anybody have any idea what the vote count was?
[02:37:08.639 --> 02:37:10.360]  What his percentage of the total was?
[02:37:12.827 --> 02:37:16.568]  98% in Austria-Hungary.
[02:37:17.268 --> 02:37:19.268]  That's just about everybody!
[02:37:20.809 --> 02:37:24.809]  Everybody voted for Hitler because he was going to solve all their economic problems.
[02:37:25.229 --> 02:37:29.810]  Did Hitler get elected on Monday and start throwing people into ovens on Friday?
[02:37:30.930 --> 02:37:31.270]  No!
[02:37:31.690 --> 02:37:33.531]  It was a gradual process.
[02:37:34.091 --> 02:37:37.651]  The first thing that Hitler did was start to write newspaper articles.
[02:37:39.032 --> 02:37:40.412]  Everything that was going wrong
[02:37:41.553 --> 02:37:42.894]  Was the Jews' fault.
[02:37:43.694 --> 02:37:45.795]  They're the ones that caused all these problems.
[02:37:47.216 --> 02:37:50.998]  Did the Jews write their own newspaper articles and go, I disagree?
[02:37:51.018 --> 02:37:53.279]  Well, not that I can think of.
[02:37:53.319 --> 02:37:57.661]  I've never read any newspaper articles that, you know, contradicted any of that.
[02:37:58.061 --> 02:38:00.843]  So then, the Jews had to wear the Star of David.
[02:38:01.943 --> 02:38:03.664]  So we can tell who you are.
[02:38:05.005 --> 02:38:08.546]  Did they say, no, that's a violation of my property, privacy.
[02:38:08.586 --> 02:38:09.467]  I don't have to tell you.
[02:38:10.239 --> 02:38:12.060]  Whether, you know, I'm Jewish or not?
[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:13.880]  No.
[02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:16.881]  The Jews decided, well, it's a religious symbol.
[02:38:17.342 --> 02:38:18.202]  We love God.
[02:38:18.242 --> 02:38:21.503]  We should be proud to wear the Star of David.
[02:38:23.684 --> 02:38:31.827]  Eventually, the Germans came in and they broke all of the windows in all of the Jewish businesses in one weekend.
[02:38:32.967 --> 02:38:37.769]  Saturday night was known as Kristallnacht, which is German for Night of Glass.
[02:38:38.857 --> 02:38:42.239]  You couldn't walk up and down the sidewalks because they were filled with glass!
[02:38:43.940 --> 02:38:45.981]  Did the Jews rise up and say, now dammit!
[02:38:46.462 --> 02:38:47.842]  You're violating my property!
[02:38:47.882 --> 02:38:48.943]  You shouldn't do that!
[02:38:49.604 --> 02:38:49.944]  No.
[02:38:49.964 --> 02:38:53.486]  Actually, we don't want to make the Germans any madder than they already are.
[02:38:53.506 --> 02:38:56.167]  We want to just kind of go along to get along.
[02:38:56.428 --> 02:38:57.488]  Don't piss them off.
[02:38:58.369 --> 02:38:59.269]  They've got guns.
[02:39:00.470 --> 02:39:04.593]  Eventually, the Germans are loading them up into cattle trailers on the train.
[02:39:05.936 --> 02:39:07.096]  Where do you think you're going?
[02:39:07.156 --> 02:39:07.936]  On vacation?
[02:39:10.477 --> 02:39:12.278]  Where do you think they're going to take you?
[02:39:12.978 --> 02:39:19.359]  Well, now you're cold and naked and they're walking you into the ovens where you're going to go to mass execution.
[02:39:19.719 --> 02:39:23.780]  Is it time now to raise your hand and say, you know, I tend to disagree with all of this.
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:24.680]  Bang!
[02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:25.581]  You're dead.
[02:39:26.801 --> 02:39:28.501]  It's too late to complain.
[02:39:30.442 --> 02:39:32.422]  You should have complained at the beginning.
[02:39:33.723 --> 02:39:35.363]  When you at least had a chance.
[02:39:38.007 --> 02:39:43.770]  My question to you, and I don't expect you to answer it, just think about it in your head.
[02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:49.353]  How bad do things have to get before you do something?
[02:39:51.774 --> 02:39:53.715]  Do they have to take away all your property?
[02:39:54.675 --> 02:39:58.457]  Do they have to license every activity that you want to engage in?
[02:40:00.438 --> 02:40:07.422]  Do they have to be throwing you on cattle cars before you start to say, now wait a minute, I don't think this is a good idea.
[02:40:11.044 --> 02:40:20.057]  How long is it going to be before you finally resist and say, no, I will not comply?
[02:40:21.238 --> 02:40:21.739]  Period.
[02:40:21.759 --> 02:40:26.385]  That's a different answer for each person.
[02:40:26.906 --> 02:40:27.988]  Ask yourself now.
[02:40:29.741 --> 02:40:33.622]  Because sooner or later, you're going to come to that line, and when they cross it, what do you say?
[02:40:33.642 --> 02:40:35.363]  Well, okay, cross this line.
[02:40:35.523 --> 02:40:37.323]  Okay, now cross that line.
[02:40:37.543 --> 02:40:39.144]  Okay, now cross this line.
[02:40:39.164 --> 02:40:40.864]  And pretty soon, you're in a corner!
[02:40:44.225 --> 02:40:48.006]  Sooner or later, you've got to draw a line and stand your ground.
[02:40:49.727 --> 02:40:52.047]  Whether anybody else does or not.
[02:40:55.268 --> 02:40:58.549]  That is what liberty is all about.
[02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:07.213]  If you think I am radical, let me share with you some thoughts from some of the Founding Fathers.
[02:41:07.693 --> 02:41:24.240]  Thomas Jefferson said, and this country, with its institutions, belonged to the people who, excuse me, Thomas Jefferson, and what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance?
[02:41:25.041 --> 02:41:28.302]  Let them take arms, the tree of liberty,
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:33.283]  Must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[02:41:37.025 --> 02:41:37.305]  Right?
[02:41:37.605 --> 02:41:40.647]  We're talking bloodshed, if necessary.
[02:41:42.328 --> 02:41:43.348]  Abraham Lincoln.
[02:41:44.789 --> 02:41:49.772]  This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it.
[02:41:50.713 --> 02:41:55.435]  Whenever they shall grow weary of their existing government, they can exercise
[02:41:56.755 --> 02:42:03.899]  Their constitutional right of amending it, or their constitutional right to dismember or overthrow it.
[02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:11.523]  He also said, we the people are the rightful masters of Congress and the courts.
[02:42:12.563 --> 02:42:19.687]  Not to overthrow the Constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.
[02:42:20.527 --> 02:42:24.049]  How do you know if the Constitution has been perverted if you haven't read it?
[02:42:26.934 --> 02:42:34.540]  And that clip on YouTube, we did post it last week on InfoWars.com, is, I will not comply, period.
[02:42:36.161 --> 02:42:37.322]  And that's what it comes down to.
[02:42:37.462 --> 02:42:38.823]  And the same thing happened in England.
[02:42:39.504 --> 02:42:45.809]  I remember seeing a story last year out of Sacramento where the police are wired in to the area school bathrooms.
[02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:50.852]  And they watch you urinate, they watch you defecate.
[02:42:50.872 --> 02:42:54.135]  It's all part of the humiliation of children being brought up in a prison.
[02:42:55.339 --> 02:43:02.903]  A school has been forced to remove CCTV cameras they installed in students' toilets after furious protest from pupils and parents.
[02:43:03.423 --> 02:43:04.924]  This is in England, the Daily Mail.
[02:43:05.364 --> 02:43:06.885]  Land of the Coward, Home of the Slaves.
[02:43:07.305 --> 02:43:08.486]  We don't protest.
[02:43:08.506 --> 02:43:11.487]  We go, it's good to have a camera in the toilet.
[02:43:14.489 --> 02:43:15.049]  So sick.
[02:43:15.609 --> 02:43:16.910]  Folks, that's 1984.
[02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:19.431]  That's how it begins, is a camera in his bathroom.
[02:43:20.715 --> 02:43:31.718]  Hundreds of outraged students petitioned against the cameras after they spotted them in the toilets and even refused to use the loos a day after so they were not caught on CTV.
[02:43:32.738 --> 02:43:37.419]  Other children were kept at home by their families rather than expose them to the gross invasion of privacy.
[02:43:38.599 --> 02:43:44.641]  The cameras were installed at Libson Community College in Plymouth, Devon, which has 1,400 pupils.
[02:43:45.341 --> 02:43:50.002]  Concerns were first raised when pupils returned from a week-long break Tuesday and spotted the cameras.
[02:43:50.737 --> 02:43:57.259]  Principal Stephen Baker said contractors fitted them on the orders of other staff members who did not have the measure approved by him.
[02:43:57.279 --> 02:43:59.639]  Let me tell you how evil the British government is.
[02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:06.401]  Last year they reported nationwide, they called in the third graders and they said, we're going to play James Bond today.
[02:44:07.522 --> 02:44:16.204]  We're going to come and look at this computer, we're going to put our fingers here, it was biometric, but you're not going to tell your mommy and daddy, we're going to play spy.
[02:44:16.984 --> 02:44:19.225]  And they illegally all put them into a database.
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:22.421]  Government is criminal!
[02:44:22.841 --> 02:44:27.703]  Just like our criminal government says it's the law, you gotta take HPV, live cancer virus.
[02:44:28.344 --> 02:44:29.064]  There's no law.
[02:44:30.685 --> 02:44:32.085]  Bet you a million dollars there isn't.
[02:44:32.326 --> 02:44:34.827]  I know, you won't actually go look it up, you'll just claim I'm lying.
[02:44:35.067 --> 02:44:36.627]  Okay, get your million cash.
[02:44:38.388 --> 02:44:45.091]  He mandated to the State Health Department to put it on a list of recommended, there's no law, and there's a waiver.
[02:44:45.151 --> 02:44:46.952]  But how's there even a waiver if there's no law?
[02:44:47.232 --> 02:44:48.873]  See, that's even more of their color of law.
[02:44:50.439 --> 02:44:51.500]  But I hear it all over the news.
[02:44:51.580 --> 02:44:52.160]  It's the law.
[02:44:52.220 --> 02:44:53.301]  It's the law in the U.S.
[02:44:53.361 --> 02:44:54.262]  You better take it too.
[02:44:54.602 --> 02:44:56.283]  Now they want to make all the boys take it.
[02:45:00.766 --> 02:45:03.328]  And it's frustrating to know I can only reach a fraction of people.
[02:45:04.829 --> 02:45:07.812]  I want to reach all those women who are scared for their 12-year-old daughters.
[02:45:08.232 --> 02:45:11.054]  Oh honey, I want you to take the shot in case you get sexually active.
[02:45:13.215 --> 02:45:13.756]  Oh honey,
[02:45:14.577 --> 02:45:29.565]  You need to tell your daughter that there's hundreds of these viruses, over 350 strains that can quote, give you cancer, that this one only covers six strains, and that if you already are infected with it, it gives you a 44% increased chance in getting the type of cancer.
[02:45:29.585 --> 02:45:38.170]  I mean, you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning than getting cervical cancer from HPV, because they haven't even proven it causes HPV.
[02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:42.752]  It's a virus that about half the population, they'll look it up.
[02:45:44.199 --> 02:45:47.280]  Right at 50%, about 49% of us have it.
[02:45:49.721 --> 02:45:50.962]  I mean, it's rampant.
[02:45:52.542 --> 02:45:54.103]  It's on things at the gym.
[02:45:54.843 --> 02:45:56.604]  Most cancer, by the way, is viral.
[02:45:57.224 --> 02:45:58.165]  I've always told you that.
[02:45:58.505 --> 02:46:00.386]  So why don't you just take your live cancer virus?
[02:46:01.746 --> 02:46:04.267]  I just want to warn people.
[02:46:04.347 --> 02:46:05.568]  That's all I want.
[02:46:05.688 --> 02:46:11.550]  I burn with the desire to be able to... I mean, I hear these airhead women and men.
[02:46:11.690 --> 02:46:12.871]  I hear them in stores.
[02:46:13.584 --> 02:46:15.505]  I hear them talking about the HPV.
[02:46:15.525 --> 02:46:19.348]  I hear them going, my daughter got that so she'll never have cancer.
[02:46:20.028 --> 02:46:24.171]  I mean, a lot of these idiots think it's a cancer cure where you'll never get any cancer.
[02:46:25.092 --> 02:46:31.236]  No, it's a live cancer virus from a company that hates your guts and has been involved in all sorts of eugenics.
[02:46:34.298 --> 02:46:39.001]  I mean, I can't believe that we have to explain to people that cameras in bathrooms is a bad idea.
[02:46:42.651 --> 02:46:52.539]  Meanwhile, Barack Obama's in trouble right now because he's been telling people he's for globalism, but he's been criticizing NAFTA.
[02:46:53.100 --> 02:46:57.744]  So he told international business leaders that, don't worry, wink wink, I'm going to continue everything.
[02:46:57.784 --> 02:46:59.225]  This is just rhetoric for the cattle.
[02:47:00.086 --> 02:47:03.769]  Obama targets NAFTA, but says supporters, said he supports free trade.
[02:47:04.029 --> 02:47:06.451]  Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama assured U.S.
[02:47:06.491 --> 02:47:07.692]  trading partners on Saturday
[02:47:08.382 --> 02:47:14.424]  That he did not oppose free trade despite making increasing critical comments about multinational deals such as NAFTA.
[02:47:14.984 --> 02:47:25.507]  Obama, an Illinois Senator, has turned trade into a centerpiece of his campaign in Ohio, where trade agreements are particularly unpopular as domestic manufacturing jobs disappear.
[02:47:26.708 --> 02:47:27.868]  Which NAFTA and GATT do!
[02:47:27.928 --> 02:47:28.808]  Which we said they do!
[02:47:29.649 --> 02:47:32.990]  But it brings it to slave client nations where the globalists fully dominate.
[02:47:34.830 --> 02:47:37.351]  It's already too late, there's nothing to protect anyways anymore.
[02:47:37.944 --> 02:47:44.732]  Texas and Ohio had nominated contests for March 4th, and Obama has criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement and campaign stops.
[02:47:46.774 --> 02:47:49.237]  And he pounded Hillary Clinton for supporting NAFTA.
[02:47:49.969 --> 02:47:53.592]  But Obama, who entered the White House with only four years of experience as a U.S.
[02:47:53.612 --> 02:48:01.400]  Senator, in addition to several years in the Illinois legislature, said his misgivings about NAFTA did not mean he was opposed to such accords in general.
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:03.482]  See, it's all talk, folks.
[02:48:04.022 --> 02:48:15.773]  But I know, drink your fluoride water, take your mercury shots, just believe he's good when he's for global government, for global tax, for gun control, for open borders.
[02:48:17.583 --> 02:48:21.505]  It's just fun to be taken for a big fat ride by Barack Obama.
[02:48:23.186 --> 02:48:26.428]  It'll take years to wake the liberals up that he's bad when he gets in.
[02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:29.690]  He'll be gun-grabbing, staging terror attacks.
[02:48:29.770 --> 02:48:30.530]  It's gonna be bad.
[02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:33.912]  Because the people behind him are the Mac Daddies of staged terror.
[02:48:37.534 --> 02:48:39.075]  Oh man, more of the same.
[02:48:39.155 --> 02:48:41.356]  Socialized health care at the barrel of a gun.
[02:48:43.017 --> 02:48:43.878]  Your call, straight ahead.
[02:48:46.696 --> 02:48:48.096]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.116 --> 02:48:50.217]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.937 --> 02:48:55.159]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.819 --> 02:48:58.620]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:00.881]  Wasn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:49:01.441 --> 02:49:03.882]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.622 --> 02:49:11.944]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.961 --> 02:49:19.944]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.405 --> 02:49:23.887]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.267 --> 02:49:26.789]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.849 --> 02:49:27.990]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:28.010 --> 02:49:28.770]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.790 --> 02:49:29.871]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.051 --> 02:49:30.812]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.052 --> 02:49:32.052]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:32.213 --> 02:49:36.756]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:49:36.956 --> 02:49:40.398]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:40.698 --> 02:49:41.459]  Endgame.
[02:49:41.699 --> 02:49:43.380]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:44.741]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.641 --> 02:49:50.203]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:49:50.623 --> 02:49:53.544]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:49:53.864 --> 02:49:56.425]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:49:56.786 --> 02:50:01.607]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:50:01.988 --> 02:50:07.350]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:10.631]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:50:10.811 --> 02:50:11.391]  We're good to go.
[02:50:34.219 --> 02:50:34.460]  We're good.
[02:50:45.902 --> 02:50:49.485]  In this jungle called life, only the tiger survives.
[02:50:49.965 --> 02:50:54.548]  So says the armchair survivalist Kurt Wilson, owner of Survival Enterprises.
[02:50:55.008 --> 02:51:07.317]  Kurt talks common sense about food storage, health care, firearms and weaponry, security, urban and wilderness survival techniques, and the simple things we can all do to help us and our loved ones survive when bad times hit.
[02:51:07.557 --> 02:51:10.759]  Learn to be one step ahead of the crowd in everyday situations.
[02:51:12.551 --> 02:51:21.378]  The Armchair Survivalist is geared for the rest of us who don't have unlimited funds to buy land, a cabin, build a bunker, or buy all the expensive survival supplies that would come in handy.
[02:51:21.558 --> 02:51:23.920]  He shows you how to work smarter, not harder.
[02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:28.163]  For over 25 years, Kurt has been helping people prepare for hard times.
[02:51:28.443 --> 02:51:37.991]  The Armchair Survivalist is sure to be an informative, entertaining, and educational talk show with Kurt not only sharing his vast level of survival knowledge, but taking your calls as well.
[02:51:41.954 --> 02:51:42.374]  We're good to go.
[02:52:06.220 --> 02:52:07.641]  But do people know what that means?
[02:52:07.661 --> 02:52:08.722]  These are hardcore killers.
[02:52:08.782 --> 02:52:10.263]  They want to kill you.
[02:52:10.283 --> 02:52:13.406]  We're going to have to fight them, aren't we?
[02:52:13.446 --> 02:52:13.646]  Gear up.
[02:52:27.322 --> 02:52:30.965]  Folks, the longest continually operating swearable foods company in the nation.
[02:52:31.286 --> 02:52:31.626]  27 years.
[02:52:32.006 --> 02:52:33.067]  J. Michael Stevens Group.
[02:52:33.107 --> 02:52:36.350]  They have high quality, pre-striped food that lasts more than 10 years.
[02:52:36.370 --> 02:52:39.673]  10 years when it's not stored in a climate controlled area.
[02:52:40.093 --> 02:52:42.735]  Wonderful folks with all the uncertainty of the things that are happening.
[02:52:43.156 --> 02:52:44.357]  You need swearable foods.
[02:52:45.037 --> 02:52:47.019]  I've gotten from them now four times.
[02:52:47.079 --> 02:52:47.940]  I'm really gearing up.
[02:52:49.002 --> 02:52:59.130]  800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com, giant banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:59.210 --> 02:53:02.533]  All right, I'm going to blitz through four of your calls, give each one of you one minute.
[02:53:03.013 --> 02:53:05.015]  Nick in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:53:07.457 --> 02:53:11.500]  Two questions I want you to get off air, and then I want some of you, I want you to comment on.
[02:53:12.765 --> 02:53:20.289]  Real quick, I wanted to know if you knew anything about Aaron Russo's new movie that he plugged on his last interview with you before he died, if you knew if he had even started working on that?
[02:53:20.369 --> 02:53:24.031]  No, it was some fiction film about the Federal Reserve, I think.
[02:53:24.852 --> 02:53:39.600]  Okay, alright, and then my other question is, I've been trying to put some of this stuff together about Obama, and I know, I think we're on the same page, we want to think he's totally evil, and you know, CFR and blah blah blah, and Presumptive Kids behind him, but I have another idea that I wanted you to try to pin out, which is that,
[02:53:40.359 --> 02:53:55.543]  Given that the entire neocon right wing is pushing Hillary, it's clear that they would much prefer her, and there's a bunch of other things, but keeping it short, is it possible that you think he is a fall guy set up by the CFR, or you know, by the powers that be?
[02:53:55.563 --> 02:53:57.503]  Y'all, anything, look, we don't know.
[02:53:57.903 --> 02:54:00.904]  I agree with you, I appreciate the call, we're gonna find out in the fullness of time.
[02:54:00.924 --> 02:54:03.605]  That's the type of call I want when they ask real questions.
[02:54:05.825 --> 02:54:07.926]  We don't know, we just know his policies are evil.
[02:54:08.709 --> 02:54:10.470]  But are they trying to cheat him in the election?
[02:54:10.530 --> 02:54:10.850]  Yes.
[02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:13.271]  Have they pulled security off of him?
[02:54:13.311 --> 02:54:13.571]  Yes.
[02:54:13.631 --> 02:54:14.711]  Is weird stuff going on?
[02:54:14.751 --> 02:54:15.031]  Yes.
[02:54:15.871 --> 02:54:18.772]  Are the neocons behind Hillary to the point where I thought she would win?
[02:54:19.693 --> 02:54:20.793]  And I may be proven wrong?
[02:54:21.073 --> 02:54:21.373]  I hope.
[02:54:21.453 --> 02:54:22.033]  You know, I hate her.
[02:54:22.074 --> 02:54:22.614]  I hope I'm wrong.
[02:54:22.634 --> 02:54:27.135]  You know, something weird's going on with Obama, but he's definitely bad when it comes to his policies.
[02:54:27.455 --> 02:54:28.536]  Is he as evil as Hillary?
[02:54:28.616 --> 02:54:29.276]  Obviously no.
[02:54:30.156 --> 02:54:30.856]  But does it matter?
[02:54:30.936 --> 02:54:32.497]  Presidents don't run anything to begin with.
[02:54:33.717 --> 02:54:35.378]  Eric in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:54:37.717 --> 02:54:39.098]  Actually, California, Alex.
[02:54:39.178 --> 02:54:39.839]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:54:39.859 --> 02:54:40.159]  Sorry.
[02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:42.481]  No problem.
[02:54:42.501 --> 02:54:47.865]  I wasn't going to call today, but I was listening to the older gentleman calling and saying that there's just no fight.
[02:54:48.485 --> 02:54:55.611]  Well, you know, I'm sitting there on hold, just like a pent-up bull, just waiting to get out of the chute.
[02:54:57.412 --> 02:55:00.555]  And then, you know, I've got to sit there and listen to this guy reading poetry.
[02:55:00.815 --> 02:55:02.416]  We've got to stop with the poetry.
[02:55:02.676 --> 02:55:03.497]  This is a fight.
[02:55:03.931 --> 02:55:05.193]  These people want to kill us!
[02:55:05.633 --> 02:55:07.255]  And we've got to get raged!
[02:55:07.335 --> 02:55:15.185]  We've got... I was at the shooting range this Sunday, just yesterday, and the place was packed!
[02:55:15.505 --> 02:55:16.787]  It was packed with young people.
[02:55:17.167 --> 02:55:18.509]  We've got to get fired up!
[02:55:18.959 --> 02:55:22.160]  We've got to get angry at these people that want to kill us!
[02:55:22.641 --> 02:55:23.881]  I agree.
[02:55:23.961 --> 02:55:26.763]  Hey, 7,000 people at the Austin Ron Paul rally.
[02:55:27.003 --> 02:55:30.204]  We need to form into anti-UN, anti-New World Order.
[02:55:30.424 --> 02:55:37.788]  We need to form into InfoWar Corps to go out and educate the rest of the cattle and activate them and wake them up.
[02:55:37.828 --> 02:55:40.309]  But hey, poetry, art, it's all part of that.
[02:55:40.589 --> 02:55:41.789]  Different strokes for different folks.
[02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:42.750]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:43.530 --> 02:55:45.151]  Eric, call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:45.191 --> 02:55:46.492]  Mike and Kyle, everybody.
[02:55:46.572 --> 02:55:47.953]  I want to hear these type of calls.
[02:55:48.273 --> 02:55:49.354]  You're fired up and angry?
[02:55:49.394 --> 02:55:50.795]  We'll open the show tomorrow with calls.
[02:55:52.556 --> 02:55:53.617]  I've got to start taking more calls.
[02:55:53.677 --> 02:55:54.757]  I just babble so much.
[02:55:56.038 --> 02:55:58.660]  We have the forces to defeat the New World Order.
[02:55:59.521 --> 02:56:01.122]  And I think they know we're going to crush them.
[02:56:01.862 --> 02:56:06.945]  Just think about when we're having mass trials of these people, giving them full due process before they're executed.
[02:56:08.186 --> 02:56:12.169]  They need to know, all these psychopaths, they're going to cry and beg
[02:56:13.254 --> 02:56:15.756]  Before they go into Hades.
[02:56:16.657 --> 02:56:16.917]  All right.
[02:56:16.937 --> 02:56:18.518]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:56:18.578 --> 02:56:20.019]  I covered a lot in the first hour.
[02:56:20.299 --> 02:56:21.160]  You don't want to miss it.
[02:56:21.180 --> 02:56:23.082]  Tune back in at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:23.322 --> 02:56:24.583]  The internet screen's right there.
