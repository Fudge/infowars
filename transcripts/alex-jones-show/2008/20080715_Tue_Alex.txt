[00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:11.496]  Jesse Ventura decided to not run for the Senate.
[00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:16.640]  Out of Minnesota, we had begged him to do so.
[00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.961]  Many others had asked him to.
[00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:20.504]  But he has a handicapped daughter.
[00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:27.928]  As we told Larry King Live, he doesn't really believe the American people want somebody to fight.
[00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.829]  He thinks we want slavery.
[00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.490]  That's what he described yesterday.
[00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.292]  And he did say that he believes the government staged the attacks.
[00:00:36.332 --> 00:00:39.774]  He went further yesterday saying he thinks they may stage more attacks.
[00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:43.135]  And we have to commend his bravery.
[00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:44.916]  He's already run.
[00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:45.816]  He's already been a governor.
[00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:48.738]  He already has had them attack his children.
[00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:51.719]  And he has now decided to evacuate the United States.
[00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:54.867]  So, uh, he is evacuated.
[00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:56.489]  He is evacuating the next few months.
[00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:59.611]  He's basically going to leave and mainly stay in Mexico.
[00:01:00.552 --> 00:01:04.616]  And I guess watch our collapse from there as, uh, then Mexico is drug into the black hole.
[00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:07.458]  But he lives an hour away from electricity in the jungle.
[00:01:08.019 --> 00:01:09.059]  Sounds like absolute heaven.
[00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.501]  I can barely control myself not evacuating immediately.
[00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:12.963]  But you know what?
[00:01:13.283 --> 00:01:16.406]  I am committed, ladies and gentlemen, and I am sworn to stay here.
[00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.470]  That doesn't mean I won't evacuate my family, though.
[00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:33.321]  I mean, if I see them do the preparations for mass roundups because they'll condition you first, I'll probably evacuate my family, and I'll announce I've evacuated them so others can evacuate.
[00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:49.907]  You know, I think you deserve that advice, at least the opportunity to have my advice, because the people of America are demonic pig monsters, on average, and if there's a massive depression, they will turn into demons.
[00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:57.289]  They will do whatever they're told by the establishment for cheeseburgers and liquor and to be told they're powerful and cool.
[00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.733]  And to be given shiny baubles like any bird brain would want to put in their nest.
[00:02:05.134 --> 00:02:08.396]  So, that basically is what's happening.
[00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:15.355]  And the New World Order wants to fully rape everyone, and I don't blame him for evacuating.
[00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:18.696]  He says he'd be alone up there, and he also knows they kill senators.
[00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:21.976]  They blow up their planes all the time, they kill them all the time.
[00:02:23.416 --> 00:02:24.257]  I've seen the statistics.
[00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:31.878]  You're thousands of times more likely to be killed in an aircraft if you're a senator or a congressman than if you are just a citizen.
[00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:34.358]  Even citizens that fly as much, they're thousands of times.
[00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.679]  So people are criticizing Ventura right now
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.641]  Have you done as much as Ventura's done?
[00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.643]  I mean, you know, he told us at the end.
[00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:44.964]  I was thinking he'd run.
[00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:45.664]  I was trying to push him.
[00:02:46.025 --> 00:02:50.828]  At the end of the interview, he said, alright Alex, I'll come back on your show before I go back down to Mexico.
[00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:54.310]  And I walked out during the break and I said, oh, you hear that Burmese?
[00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.351]  And he said, absolutely.
[00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:57.432]  He's going to Mexico.
[00:02:57.492 --> 00:02:59.533]  He's going to announce he's not running tonight.
[00:02:59.553 --> 00:03:00.414]  And I came back on air.
[00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:02.895]  In fact, let's cue that up.
[00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:03.895]  He left us at 1.05.
[00:03:04.796 --> 00:03:08.558]  I want to play that at the end of the show, just the last minute with Ventura.
[00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:09.158]  It's ready.
[00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:10.619]  Oh, you're ready with it right now?
[00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:11.500]  Yep.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.780]  Let's go ahead and play that right now.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.221]  Here it is.
[00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:14.741]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:18.784]  It's always my pleasure, and I look forward to doing it again before I head to Mexico.
[00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:19.504]  Thank you.
[00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:20.545]  We'll talk to you soon, sir.
[00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:21.385]  Very good.
[00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:21.765]  Bye-bye.
[00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:26.328]  Oh, that's too bad, isn't it?
[00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.410]  I mean, he told you right there.
[00:03:31.138 --> 00:03:33.240]  You heard it here first before Larry King Live.
[00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:44.409]  And you know, I've just got to admire Jesse Ventura and Charlie Sheen and the German Defense Minister and the Italian President and one of the leaders of the Diet, one of the leaders of his party in Japan.
[00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:51.474]  And Bill Christensen, former CIA Section Chief in Berlin, coming out on my show saying it is an inside job.
[00:03:52.455 --> 00:03:55.357]  And Ray McGovern, White House Briefer, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Sr.
[00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:57.674]  And the thousands of others.
[00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:05.699]  Kevin Ryan lost his hundred and something thousand dollar a year engineer job at Underwriting Laboratories.
[00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.263]  He saw their secret report that the building had to be blown up, the towers, and he said, my God, you did internal tests and you know this was blown up?
[00:04:12.344 --> 00:04:15.526]  And they said, shut up, we're not going to tell people.
[00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:18.167]  And he came out and released the report and said they blew it up.
[00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.790]  And now they've narrowed it into who did it.
[00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:28.525]  God Almighty, God's giving us a chance to see the truth and fight against this.
[00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:37.150]  I mean, it's now been declassified that top Al-Qaeda leaders meeting with the White House and the Congress in the week before, in the week of 9-11.
[00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.353]  You got Bush meeting with the head of the Carlisle Group, with the head of the Bin Laden family in Al-Qaeda meetings as well.
[00:04:44.294 --> 00:04:46.015]  God Almighty, these people are sick!
[00:04:46.976 --> 00:04:47.296]  Sick!
[00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:48.156]  Sick!
[00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:52.593]  Gas prices are out of control!
[00:04:53.034 --> 00:04:56.716]  Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones Show have done.
[00:04:56.916 --> 00:04:59.658]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:03.580]  Introducing SFR's Protecta Complete fuel system and engine treatment.
[00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.302]  Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:10.044]  Fleet tested by major oil companies showing improvements in every car tested.
[00:05:10.264 --> 00:05:13.786]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:19.630]  Protecta cleans up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tankful and is safe for all cars.
[00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:27.015]  Test conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.
[00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:35.101]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive an engine treatment free at $12.95 value.
[00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:37.283]  Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.
[00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:41.346]  Go to oilcompanysecret.com, that's oilcompanysecret.com or call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:05:41.406 --> 00:05:41.706]  That's 888-873-7371.
[00:05:52.555 --> 00:05:54.656]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:59.799]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:02.440]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.782]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[00:06:06.942 --> 00:06:09.844]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[00:06:09.984 --> 00:06:13.225]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[00:06:13.326 --> 00:06:18.188]  Food riots and red lines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[00:06:18.388 --> 00:06:22.331]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[00:06:22.451 --> 00:06:27.294]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.
[00:06:27.394 --> 00:06:29.035]  We have tons of food in stock now.
[00:06:29.235 --> 00:06:30.716]  Call 1-800-753-1981.
[00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:34.339]  That's 1-800-753-1981.
[00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.460]  Or go to BeforeIt'sTooLate.us.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.682]  That's BeforeIt'sTooLate.us.
[00:06:38.822 --> 00:06:41.604]  Where you'll find what you'll need to keep you and your loved ones secure.
[00:06:41.744 --> 00:06:45.466]  And remember, those without food will be servants of those with the food.
[00:06:45.766 --> 00:06:46.187]  Call now.
[00:06:50.032 --> 00:06:57.036]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero and we knew what to do.
[00:06:57.056 --> 00:06:58.837]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:59.057 --> 00:07:05.480]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.804]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:14.653]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:21.796]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:07:22.076 --> 00:07:25.138]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:07:25.258 --> 00:07:30.480]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.661]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:39.663]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:40.804]  Yep, he's all set and ready.
[00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:44.080]  He knows we want to talk about population control, right?
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.180]  Yep, that is correct.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.440]  Well done, let's do it.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.240]  Okay, here we go.
[00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:48.081]  Law.
[00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:57.243]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:57.863 --> 00:08:00.904]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:07.806]  I know that we have a lot of phone calls in the wings at the bottom of the hour, I promise.
[00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:09.647]  We'll get to your phone calls.
[00:08:10.973 --> 00:08:22.603]  Dr. Stan Monteith for decade upon decade upon decade has been exposing how they've engineered the AIDS virus, how they carry out chemical biological attacks.
[00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:31.851]  He is a medical doctor, MD, also a surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, and he's written quite a few books, The Brotherhood of Darkness.
[00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.332]  He has all the source documents.
[00:08:33.372 --> 00:08:37.695]  He's very neurotic, and that's good about having all his documentation in a row.
[00:08:38.416 --> 00:08:52.393]  And I wanted to have him on about the global population reduction agenda, go over some of the facts, how they're doing it, what the mercury in the vaccines, what the rest of the cancer viruses found in hundreds of vaccines are doing, why we've gone from 1 in 33 with cancer to 1 in 3.
[00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:58.558]  Why all this is happening and what the Globalist Master Plan says.
[00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:13.107]  Remember, the official United Nations Biological Diversity Assessments that are in my film Road to Tyranny, that you can get at any library, say they plan to reinstitute human sacrifice at giant temples to reduce our numbers.
[00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:15.228]  Now look, I can't make this up.
[00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:17.250]  That sounds insane.
[00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:26.513]  Believe me, when I first heard about it ten years ago and went and looked it up at UT and got the UN reports and then videotaped it to put it in the film, I couldn't believe it.
[00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:30.395]  They are out of their minds lunatics!
[00:09:31.235 --> 00:09:42.239]  But Caligula married his horse, Nero would go in and murder people dressed up like a werewolf at their dinner parties, children chained down, these are mainline histories,
[00:09:43.598 --> 00:09:44.579]  Look at what Hitler did.
[00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:46.180]  They always go crazy.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:52.964]  Kim Jong-il has a seven-story pleasure palace and has Asian starlets kidnapped that he rapes and kills.
[00:09:53.424 --> 00:10:07.853]  I mean, I'm sorry that they're saying and doing this, but I know it sounds insane, but they say they're going to reinstitute human sacrifice to control population, as they did in Aztec temples, and now they've built one.
[00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:10.035]  Tex Mars covers that in his new book.
[00:10:11.355 --> 00:10:12.856]  I mean, this is Looney Tune land.
[00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:16.377]  I'm not saying that any of this is even real.
[00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:17.457]  The point is, they believe it.
[00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:20.518]  They believe that they are manifesting it.
[00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:25.940]  Let's go to Dr. Stan Monteith, Radio Liberty syndicated radio talk show host.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.761]  I now own more than 50 affiliates across the land last time I checked.
[00:10:30.482 --> 00:10:35.003]  Dr. Monteith, thank you and your busy schedule doing five hours of radio a day for joining us, sir.
[00:10:35.723 --> 00:10:37.404]  It's always a pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[00:10:38.413 --> 00:10:39.973]  Doctor, I'm going to try my best.
[00:10:39.994 --> 00:10:45.375]  You know, I'm the king of interrupting because so much goes through my mind, and I burn with a passion to inform people.
[00:10:45.735 --> 00:10:54.398]  Walk through the history of population reduction, what we're facing, and what the master plan is, and then the Luciferian religion that drives it.
[00:10:55.768 --> 00:11:08.925]  Well, basically, of course, these ideas really begin back with Malthus, who was an Anglican minister, if you can believe it, but he was writing a series of essays on population control in the late 1700s, early 1800s.
[00:11:11.028 --> 00:11:16.370]  He even talked about, you know, how we just couldn't let new children be born unless somebody had died off.
[00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:25.633]  And he talked about, you know, if we didn't bring things under control, we were going to have to begin building our cities next to stagnant ponds and discourage cleanliness.
[00:11:25.713 --> 00:11:30.574]  And he certainly opposed anybody who wanted to stop the spread of disease.
[00:11:30.754 --> 00:11:34.075]  Now, we refer to these concepts as Malthusian.
[00:11:34.135 --> 00:11:38.157]  Of course, they were picked up by a fellow named Galton, who followed him and was related
[00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:47.934]  Darwin, and then of course, really came to America with Margaret Sanger in the early 1900s, all financed by the Rockefellers.
[00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:52.697]  Margaret Sanger really believed in population control, but she believed in eugenics.
[00:11:52.777 --> 00:11:54.239]  That was what it was really about.
[00:11:54.799 --> 00:12:00.303]  Breeding the perfect people and doing away with the unworthy, the human wheezes to refer to.
[00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:08.410]  But what most people don't understand is that the ideas that Adolf Hitler brought in Germany actually came from the United States.
[00:12:09.002 --> 00:12:11.684]  We actually had forced sterilization.
[00:12:11.724 --> 00:12:16.007]  They sterilized tens of thousands of people in the United States in the early 1920s.
[00:12:16.107 --> 00:12:29.798]  Of course, after the debacle of the Second World War, with the horror of the Holocaust, if you understand that from the Nazi point of view, that this was simply applied science.
[00:12:29.838 --> 00:12:35.482]  They were doing away with the unworthy people, the Jews, the Gypsies, the mentally defective,
[00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:41.531]  Those with physical handicaps, those who are genetically defective, they were purifying the gene pool.
[00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:42.551]  That's what it was about.
[00:12:43.532 --> 00:12:49.634]  Well, of course, eugenics got a bad name after the Second World War.
[00:12:50.494 --> 00:12:53.415]  But the people in the United States were totally in favor of this.
[00:12:53.756 --> 00:13:05.360]  They couldn't let the American people know that anymore than they could let them know that it was American corporations, GM, Ford, International Telephone and Telegraph that were actually, during the Second World War,
[00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:13.877]  We're actually, of course, preparing the weapons of war, the tanks, the dive bombers, the trucks, all the military equipment that they thought fit for use.
[00:13:14.277 --> 00:13:19.540]  It was all financed largely from here in the United States, creating the best enemy money could buy.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:35.326]  And then, of course, at the end of the Second World War, why, many of the scientists, the Nazi scientists, who were involved with, of course, creating new diseases, who were involved with mind control, and, of course, with the space program, were brought to the United States under
[00:13:36.005 --> 00:13:37.566]  Under Operation Paperclip.
[00:13:38.006 --> 00:13:40.447]  And, of course, we have a 4-tape set on that.
[00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:42.148]  You can check that out on the Internet.
[00:13:42.548 --> 00:13:47.991]  A wonderful book by Linda Hunt called The Secret Agenda on Operation Paperclip.
[00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:55.895]  And then, of course, we helped 10,000 of the most vicious of the Nazi criminals escape to South America.
[00:13:55.935 --> 00:14:02.959]  The CIA, MI6, and a cell within the Vatican helped 10,000 Nazis escape to South America.
[00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:03.759]  Martin Borman,
[00:14:04.258 --> 00:14:05.259]  I want to just add,
[00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:55.825]  Eugenics, sterilization, 500,000 plus, continued until 1987, publicly, through health departments, and the blood taking at birth of babies, all of that is about the eugenics program, and also, public eugenics was about purifying the elite, exterminating the suboid, subhumans, but the real eugenics at the higher level, as they wrote, and as my film Endgame covers, and as you know, is really about dumbing us down, and having a servant class for the elite, is it not?
[00:14:56.516 --> 00:15:00.697]  Well, those who are allowed to live, but they intend to kill off most of the people in the world.
[00:15:00.957 --> 00:15:08.300]  Now, certainly anybody who questions that is only to read the writings of Jacques Cousteau, and we actually provide this to our ministry.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:23.645]  In an article that is published in the UNESCO Courier in November of 1991, Jacques Cousteau, who everybody knows, oh my goodness, he invented the scuba gear and he swam with the dolphins, Jacques Cousteau
[00:15:24.266 --> 00:15:37.900]  Discuss the need to bring the world back into balance, and said, you know, it's a terrible thing, we're going to have to eliminate 350,000 people a day.
[00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.024]  350,000 people a day is a terrible thing to say, but even worse not to say it.
[00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:48.410]  And of course, you read the writings of Bertrand Russell in his book, The Impact of Science on Society.
[00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:53.276]  We talked about, you know, we really don't kill off enough with abortion and with war.
[00:15:53.576 --> 00:15:58.278]  What we need is a black plague to sweep the world once in every generation.
[00:15:58.358 --> 00:16:11.123]  And of course now, Jacques Cousteau's son has all these TV shows and it's always, humans are bad, all these nature shows, humans are bad, and Dr. Bianca gives speeches saying, kill 90% of us, and he gets a standing ovation.
[00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:12.384]  They are the majority.
[00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:13.264]  They're in place now.
[00:16:13.284 --> 00:16:15.545]  Well, they're in positions of power.
[00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:23.086]  And as incredible as it may seem, they're actually carrying out these programs on the American people today.
[00:16:23.846 --> 00:16:30.771]  I got involved in this with the AIDS epidemic, and it didn't make any sense if we weren't doing the logical things to try to stop this epidemic.
[00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:44.240]  Basically, you know, you stop a sexually transmitted disease by identifying who has it, find out who they got it from and who they spread it to, and, you know, force these people to stop spreading a deadly disease.
[00:16:44.924 --> 00:16:51.169]  Every effort was made to stop trying to identify the people who were infected, or we couldn't do routine testing.
[00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:54.191]  Oh my goodness, we'd drive the disease underground.
[00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:57.813]  Nobody would go to the doctor if they knew they were going to be tested for AIDS.
[00:16:58.113 --> 00:17:00.335]  We couldn't do premarital testing.
[00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:02.196]  This is a sexually transmitted disease.
[00:17:02.617 --> 00:17:04.358]  What's wrong with premarital testing?
[00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:08.541]  Oh my goodness, people wouldn't go to the doctor if they were going to be tested.
[00:17:10.737 --> 00:17:17.179]  Prenatal testing, pregnant women to prevent the mother who has the disease from spreading it to unborn child, and it's preventable.
[00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:19.300]  We do not do neonatal testing.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.761]  We do not do hardly any of the things.
[00:17:21.781 --> 00:17:24.062]  There are a few states where they do neonatal testing.
[00:17:24.622 --> 00:17:31.504]  Finally, after about 15 years, the Centers for Disease Control did come out and say, well, maybe we ought to do routine testing.
[00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:34.486]  But, of course, we blocked this in other countries.
[00:17:34.526 --> 00:17:38.327]  In Africa today, this is being used for population control.
[00:17:39.005 --> 00:17:45.608]  If you go into Botswana, and we have the report, anybody who wants to verify them, we'll be glad to provide them.
[00:17:46.128 --> 00:17:49.070]  In Botswana, where they are, the U.S.
[00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.851]  Commerce Department is monitoring the AIDS epidemic.
[00:17:52.712 --> 00:17:56.593]  Why are we spending money to monitor the AIDS epidemic in Botswana?
[00:17:57.094 --> 00:17:57.254]  Why?
[00:17:57.294 --> 00:17:59.415]  Because we want to see what a great job we're doing.
[00:18:00.115 --> 00:18:05.918]  And 46% of the pregnant women there, they test every pregnant woman for HIV disease,
[00:18:06.577 --> 00:18:09.299]  46% are infected, and they're all going to die.
[00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:15.102]  And this disease is simply wiping out the populations of many African countries.
[00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:21.485]  I mean, the average age, for instance, in a place like Zimbabwe has dropped from about 64 down to about 38.
[00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:32.731]  Well, even the BBC has had to admit that they find young girls who've never been sexually active, virgins, and their family doesn't even have HIV,
[00:18:33.491 --> 00:18:48.301]  And then they say they must have got it from dirty needles when they were vaccinated, but then we found all sorts of sterilization compounds and other carrier viruses and things in shots, and we have all these Nobel Prize winners coming out saying HIV and AIDS is engineered.
[00:18:49.101 --> 00:18:50.802]  Well, there's no question it was engineered.
[00:18:50.862 --> 00:18:55.325]  We actually have the reports that the CIA tried to actually destroy them.
[00:18:55.345 --> 00:18:57.927]  They're called the Special Virus Cancer Project.
[00:18:57.947 --> 00:18:59.508]  They're about two inches thick.
[00:18:59.548 --> 00:19:01.749]  They put out one every year for a number of years.
[00:19:02.173 --> 00:19:04.314]  As they were engineering the new diseases.
[00:19:04.994 --> 00:19:14.777]  We know that they intended to engineer new diseases because you can actually, we have the testimony of Dr. David MacArthur before the House Appropriations Committee.
[00:19:14.797 --> 00:19:15.578]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:19:15.598 --> 00:19:17.118]  I want to talk about this when we get back from break.
[00:19:17.158 --> 00:19:24.141]  I'm also going to talk to you in this four minute break behind the scenes, Dr. Montee for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and folks that are on the internet.
[00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:27.902]  I want to come back to that to the full audience in four minutes.
[00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:39.187]  I want to ask you behind the scenes, got to go to the streams at Infowars.com folks, whether or not you've seen the new Dr. Sock video that just got released in the last year.
[00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:41.728]  Our guest is Dr. Stan Monteith.
[00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:44.349]  Radioliberty.com is the website.
[00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:46.910]  He's an amazing treasure trove of information.
[00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.291]  We're going to be having him on a lot in the near future.
[00:19:50.535 --> 00:19:52.197]  Alright, I want to talk to him.
[00:19:52.217 --> 00:19:52.438]  Thanks.
[00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:55.522]  Hey, yeah, Doc, this is a small part of the audience, but it's still key.
[00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:56.643]  I don't want to waste any of your time.
[00:19:57.264 --> 00:20:04.694]  You know, there was clips from a CBC report decades ago, about 15 years ago, with Dr. Salk, as you know, the inventor of the polio vaccine.
[00:20:05.535 --> 00:20:11.798]  Who himself is an admitted eugenicist, as you know, but just for the audience, I'm repeating the facts.
[00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:13.699]  Obviously you know more about this than I do, Doctor.
[00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:15.599]  He's one of the pioneers exposing it.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:31.406]  And then this was an outtake of him during an interview when he didn't know the camera was on, and he jokes about, yeah, we use monkeys from bioweapons labs in Africa to make the vaccine, and hundreds of millions of people got the cancer virus from it, and he's laughing about it like it's real funny.
[00:20:32.146 --> 00:20:33.067]  Have you seen that video?
[00:20:33.687 --> 00:20:55.285]  I haven't seen the video, but there's a book called The Health Century, actually, put out by the NIH, and they tell there about how the scientists, knowing full well there was a cancer virus there, were joking about, well, boy, it's got to be great for the next Olympics, because all those Russian athletes, you know, they're going to be carrying around these heavy tumors.
[00:20:55.405 --> 00:20:56.446]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:20:56.686 --> 00:20:58.928]  They're not going to be able to compete with our athletes.
[00:20:59.318 --> 00:21:01.640]  And you wonder what sort of human beings they are.
[00:21:01.921 --> 00:21:05.244]  This is actually the book put up by the National Institute of Health.
[00:21:05.344 --> 00:21:08.047]  It's called The Health Sensory, written by Edward Shorter.
[00:21:08.067 --> 00:21:12.131]  Well, I brought this up a few times on the air when I was finishing Endgame.
[00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:13.813]  By the way, have you seen Endgame yet?
[00:21:14.053 --> 00:21:14.634]  We carry it.
[00:21:14.954 --> 00:21:17.337]  You did a great job on that, Alex.
[00:21:17.797 --> 00:21:18.658]  We push that.
[00:21:18.738 --> 00:21:21.381]  We think it's the best thing we've got, you know, in the way of a video.
[00:21:21.801 --> 00:21:26.624]  Yeah, well that's good, and all people that get it make copies, that's what's important.
[00:21:27.184 --> 00:21:44.613]  But when I was finishing, and it was almost done, and my mother and dad came by to pick me up, they had my children with them, we were going to a ballet recital for my daughter, and my mother watched about ten minutes, and we're in the car driving away from the office, and she says, you know, Alex, I just can't believe it's that bad they want to exterminate us.
[00:21:44.653 --> 00:21:45.814]  I know some of them believe that.
[00:21:46.414 --> 00:21:47.675]  You know, she's got a degree in history.
[00:21:47.695 --> 00:21:54.841]  And then my dad, just suddenly, who was, you know, Academy of Sciences, he was in college when he was in high school, all that stuff.
[00:21:55.701 --> 00:22:03.127]  They took 125 of the smartest kids, they tested them over a summer, down to six kids, and they took them behind closed doors.
[00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:05.909]  The head of the botany department, Professor Spear,
[00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:15.894]  Of all people who was a German Jew, said, we're here to carry out a eugenics program, we need the smartest people to be parts of the elite to carry out eugenics.
[00:22:16.574 --> 00:22:26.518]  And my dad suddenly, and of course he declined and never got involved in it, but the point is, is they were doing this in every state, recruiting the best and brightest to be part of the New World Order.
[00:22:26.538 --> 00:22:31.480]  Like Dr. Dennis Cuddy talks about how Rockefeller would just show up in Wisconsin at a university
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:40.263]  There's no question that these are wicked and evil people who have an entirely different worldview, and they have no compassion for humanity.
[00:22:40.323 --> 00:22:43.385]  The fact that they have blocked treatments for cancer, you know, for
[00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:20.642]  Better part of the last century, and we even have an interview with the doctor, Dr. Dunnigan, who actually has heard Richard Day, who is the former medical director of Planned Parenthood, talking about this plan that they had, and they were going to suppress treatments for cancer, they're going to keep them locked away in the basement of the Rockefeller Foundation, and people are going to have to die of something.
[00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:24.686]  They might as well die of cancer.
[00:23:24.806 --> 00:23:25.106]  Stay there.
[00:23:25.126 --> 00:23:30.929]  Let's come back and talk about the CIA virus weapons program, which is declassified.
[00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:37.912]  Then let's get into what you were just talking about, suppressing cancer treatments with Dr. Stan Monteith, Radio Liberty.
[00:23:38.252 --> 00:23:38.852]  Just Google that.
[00:23:38.872 --> 00:23:41.374]  You'll find it links up on InfoWars.com.
[00:23:41.694 --> 00:23:45.616]  And remember folks, this info doesn't get out without you making it get out.
[00:23:45.676 --> 00:23:47.877]  This is life and death information.
[00:23:47.897 --> 00:23:49.778]  That's why we're risking our lives to tell you this.
[00:23:49.818 --> 00:23:50.138]  Here we go.
[00:23:59.195 --> 00:24:06.877]  Yeah, Planned Parenthood, that Bill Gates' father runs, is a premier eugenics organization set up by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[00:24:06.897 --> 00:24:10.398]  They started all the major cancer research a hundred years ago.
[00:24:10.418 --> 00:24:20.680]  And, uh, go roll your sleeves up, take that cancer injection, and then they're gonna give you a false treatment that's meant to take all your wealth so you don't pass it on.
[00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:27.072]  Carousel, Carousel, right out of Logan's Run, getting rid of the slaves.
[00:24:27.833 --> 00:24:38.500]  Going back to Dr. Stan Montee, finishing up with the CIA's Virus Cancer Weapon Program, which is known as HIV, which is a cover virus for a bunch of black ops.
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.882]  And then let's get into suppressed cancer treatments.
[00:24:41.202 --> 00:24:43.423]  He is a medical doctor and surgeon.
[00:24:44.244 --> 00:24:45.425]  By the way, quite an acclaimed one.
[00:24:45.705 --> 00:24:47.066]  Dr. Montee, please continue.
[00:24:48.254 --> 00:24:53.777]  Well, basically, all the evidence shows that they actually created new diseases.
[00:24:53.817 --> 00:25:10.327]  Now, we knew that they were going to do this, first of all, because Dr. David MacArthur, and we actually have the complete text of his testimony testifying before the House Appropriations Committee back in 1969, said that they wanted to be able to create two things.
[00:25:10.568 --> 00:25:14.530]  One would be a new disease for which there would be no immune response.
[00:25:15.092 --> 00:25:17.753]  And the other would be new chronic diseases.
[00:25:17.993 --> 00:25:28.294]  And he said, you know, some people say we shouldn't do this because it would be another means of mass killing, but if we want $10 million and within 10 years we can come up with this new disease.
[00:25:28.854 --> 00:25:31.635]  Well now, Chris, we know that the CIA works with the military.
[00:25:31.695 --> 00:25:36.056]  We know that the CIA was actually creating new diseases.
[00:25:36.256 --> 00:25:37.076]  How do we know that?
[00:25:37.476 --> 00:25:38.376]  Well, a couple of things.
[00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:43.377]  First of all, Gary Glum came out with a book called Full Disclosure, and of course, he
[00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:51.912]  One of the people who had been involved in this had actually come to him, he was dying of cancer of the pancreas, and he told him the whole story.
[00:25:51.933 --> 00:26:00.694]  It's an interesting experience and thought control to try to get a copy of Gary Glum's book, full disclosure up on the internet.
[00:26:01.134 --> 00:26:03.535]  Once in a while one comes up with a fantastic price.
[00:26:03.555 --> 00:26:10.696]  And then of course Dr. Garth Nicholson, who we've interviewed, has talked to at least one person who was involved
[00:26:11.172 --> 00:26:14.834]  Uh, with the actual production of the AIDS epidemic.
[00:26:14.974 --> 00:26:27.601]  So, certainly people, a few people have come forward, risking their lives to tell the truth, but... And let's be clear, hundreds of top bioweapon scientists in the creation and identification have all been brutally murdered.
[00:26:28.622 --> 00:26:30.083]  I'm sure they have, in fact.
[00:26:30.183 --> 00:26:32.364]  So we've had all these microbiologist killings, go ahead.
[00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:39.168]  But basically, we have the reports, I have Part 8 and Part 9, and I think Boyd Graves has all of
[00:26:40.982 --> 00:26:43.142]  They destroyed all of the early reports, but we have 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[00:26:46.464 --> 00:26:47.584]  They put them out every year.
[00:26:47.604 --> 00:26:57.988]  Orders were given, they were to be destroyed, and well, the CIA didn't do a very good job, or maybe somebody wanted to have them for history, but it tells how they created these new diseases.
[00:26:58.048 --> 00:27:02.750]  Of course, what most people don't understand is that AIDS is not simply HIV infection.
[00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:07.332]  It is combined with mycoplasm infection, or mycoplasm permanent.
[00:27:07.842 --> 00:27:10.324]  And it is a genetically altered mycoplasm.
[00:27:11.125 --> 00:27:14.147]  And of course, who owns the patent on it?
[00:27:14.608 --> 00:27:17.290]  Well, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.
[00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.074]  But basically what people do not understand is how they got this out initially.
[00:27:22.714 --> 00:27:36.165]  And of course, the way that they were able to disseminate the HIV virus in the United States was through the Hepatitis B vaccine that was given to homosexuals in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City.
[00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:39.211]  And those are the three cities where the epidemic began.
[00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:58.495]  We have a report from the San Francisco Department of Public Health, and the article will tell you that 75% of the foolish young homosexuals who volunteered for this study, 75% of the people who received the hepatitis B vaccine contracted AIDS, and most of them are long since dead.
[00:27:58.955 --> 00:28:02.536]  Same thing happened, of course, in the other cities, but we have the report on San Francisco.
[00:28:02.976 --> 00:28:05.497]  It was in the areas of Africa where they used the same
[00:28:06.004 --> 00:28:07.466]  Hepatitis B vaccine.
[00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:09.107]  Of course, you'll find the disease.
[00:28:09.968 --> 00:28:11.530]  You'll find the islands of it.
[00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.833]  There are lots of parts of Africa where this disease is very rare.
[00:28:14.853 --> 00:28:16.775]  They just don't have it.
[00:28:17.015 --> 00:28:19.157]  And that's where they happen to not have the UN there.
[00:28:19.658 --> 00:28:24.102]  Take Libya, where they caught the doctors giving the children the HIV shots.
[00:28:25.023 --> 00:28:26.204]  I mean, they were caught red-handed.
[00:28:26.224 --> 00:28:31.846]  Now listen, for those that don't know, for police, military, those that serve, why does the military get this so much more often?
[00:28:31.907 --> 00:28:37.569]  They give this to the military getting out because they don't want Rambo types to go rogue on them.
[00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.310]  You've served your usefulness.
[00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.951]  You're given a soft kill weapon.
[00:28:41.391 --> 00:28:44.693]  Doctor, a medical doctor, Stan Monteith, we have all the documents on this.
[00:28:45.073 --> 00:28:47.054]  Explain to them what a soft kill weapon is.
[00:28:47.674 --> 00:28:50.736]  Well, you're going to have to tell me because I'm not acquainted with that term.
[00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:54.558]  Well, you know, a soft kill is a biological weapon that kills you slowly.
[00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:57.380]  Oh, yeah, of course, they've introduced these.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:05.842]  I mean, we have millions of Americans who have these chronic diseases, and of course, everything is done to stop the truth from coming out.
[00:29:06.102 --> 00:29:16.085]  We actually, any of your listeners who are, don't believe that they intend to treat these chronic diseases, as only to get a copy of the Zygmunt presents his book, Between Two Ages.
[00:29:16.658 --> 00:29:19.801]  Published in 1970, you can buy them on the internet now for about $100.
[00:29:20.121 --> 00:29:25.225]  But this is a little paperback book I got for $6 back in the early 70s.
[00:29:25.325 --> 00:29:26.666]  Stay there, I want to hear about this.
[00:29:27.007 --> 00:29:29.088]  Hundreds of books, now they're killing you, laughing.
[00:29:29.869 --> 00:29:33.672]  Remember, officers, your mama shouldn't be dying at 55 of cancer.
[00:29:33.932 --> 00:29:36.935]  Your government is murdering her with pleasure.
[00:29:39.997 --> 00:29:40.938]  We're on the march.
[00:29:41.378 --> 00:29:42.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:43.892 --> 00:29:46.693]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:49.727 --> 00:30:53.048]  By the age of 60, half of all men have a prostate-related problem.
[00:30:53.208 --> 00:30:56.669]  Is there an alternative way to relieve suffering and pain of an enlarged prostate?

[00:32:23.044 --> 00:32:24.005]  Attention please!
[00:32:24.145 --> 00:32:26.547]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:29.190]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.371]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:32:30.391 --> 00:32:32.013]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:32:32.093 --> 00:32:34.956]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:32:34.996 --> 00:32:39.100]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.787]  I think the song says it all!
[00:32:50.807 --> 00:32:51.568]  John Brown!
[00:33:25.234 --> 00:33:46.263]  They are trying to drag me down They say they want to bring I am guilty For the life of a deputy For the life of a deputy now
[00:34:25.377 --> 00:34:43.547]  Every time I plant a seed He say, kill them before they grow He say, kill them before they grow now
[00:34:53.371 --> 00:34:56.753]  Lord, I didn't shoot no deputy.
[00:34:58.133 --> 00:35:03.755]  It was I who shot the sheriff.
[00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:07.777]  But I didn't shoot no deputy.
[00:35:09.097 --> 00:35:15.419]  Freedom came my way, one day now.
[00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:17.600]  And I started
[00:35:23.483 --> 00:35:34.712]  Then all of a sudden I saw Sheriff John Brown He was aiming to shoot I down So I, oh yes I, I shot him down
[00:35:47.585 --> 00:35:49.647]  That's Bob Marley live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:50.407 --> 00:35:57.713]  Yeah, Sheriff John Brown said you gotta kill them when they're little seeds before they grow.
[00:35:57.733 --> 00:36:03.837]  99% of our military has no idea what's going on.
[00:36:03.977 --> 00:36:04.537]  99% of our police
[00:36:09.411 --> 00:36:34.945]  You know the horror of knowing, having the documents that Dr. Monteith has, going to the Library of Congress and getting them, having other scientists gone, having the government documents, knowing that they're putting cancer viruses in everybody's vaccines, knowing they're murdering us all, knowing they're hurting us, knowing they're going to keep... and the elite says, well look, you know it, and the public doesn't wake up, so they deserve to die.
[00:36:35.979 --> 00:36:36.739]  It is eugenics.
[00:36:37.579 --> 00:36:39.020]  It is the ultimate selfishness.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.321]  They want to dominate the future, and they are carrying it out against all of us.
[00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:45.801]  A lot of you say, ah, so what about them Africans?
[00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:46.622]  We do need to kill them.
[00:36:47.102 --> 00:36:48.122]  I run into environmentalists.
[00:36:48.142 --> 00:36:50.342]  They're like, it's very sad, but the Earth is dying.
[00:36:50.362 --> 00:36:51.503]  We must do it.
[00:36:52.023 --> 00:36:54.163]  But you tell them, oh, you know, the soft kill's being done to you.
[00:36:54.203 --> 00:36:55.484]  And they say, what?
[00:36:55.604 --> 00:36:57.404]  Oh, my God, not me.
[00:36:57.884 --> 00:37:00.085]  I have to make sure all this is carried out.
[00:37:01.725 --> 00:37:09.589]  Dr. Monteith, let's get into more about their biological weapons program against this, and how they're suppressing cancer cures in their own documents, and then take some calls.
[00:37:10.869 --> 00:37:12.610]  Well, I mean, there's just so much to cover.
[00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:17.732]  But basically, of course, we were just talking about Zygmunt Brzezinski in his book, Between Two Ages.
[00:37:18.132 --> 00:37:26.876]  And of course, somewhere between pages 55 and 65, I don't have the exact page, although if anybody wants to get in touch with us, we'll get them copies of the page.
[00:37:27.719 --> 00:37:34.454]  At the bottom of the page is Zygmunt Brzezinski, who was the Foreign Policy and National Security Advisor to Jimmy Carter.
[00:37:38.397 --> 00:37:56.662]  When Saddam Hussein came to power, he was instrumental in topping the Shah of Iran, he was instrumental in precipitating the war in Afghanistan, and of course he was instrumental in bringing the Ayatollahs, the radicals, to power in Afghanistan, the ones that we're talking about going to war with today.
[00:37:56.682 --> 00:38:05.944]  But Zygmunt Brzezinski, writing back in 1970 in a book, Between Two Ages, talked about how in the future we were going to be able to create storms
[00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:10.814]  And droughts, and new chronic diseases to disable the enemy.
[00:38:11.254 --> 00:38:13.075]  Because we are the enemy.
[00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:18.880]  Today, Zygmunt Brzezinski, of course, is the Foreign Policy Advisor to a man named Barack Obama.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.221]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:38:20.321 --> 00:38:22.383]  So, he's been around for a long time.
[00:38:22.423 --> 00:38:23.684]  That was 38 years ago.
[00:38:24.124 --> 00:38:29.609]  But he was writing at that time about these chronic diseases they were going to be able to create.
[00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:35.154]  And about 10 years after David MacArthur asked for the $10 million,
[00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:38.928]  Why, we suddenly saw a whole flock of new diseases occurring.
[00:38:39.528 --> 00:38:56.796]  One we call AIDS, but of course it's not simply HIV infection, it's associated with chronic mycoplasma infection that does the damage, a genetically modified mycoplasma fermentans, and this is covered in a wonderful book by one of the world's leading scientists, although it's done in fiction form.
[00:38:57.196 --> 00:39:05.099]  It's called Project Daylily, and we actually carry the book, Project Daylily, by Dr. Garth and Nancy Nicholson.
[00:39:05.698 --> 00:39:18.592]  Anyway, of course, about 10 years after Zygmunt Brzezinski and David McCarthy were talking about creating the new diseases, why suddenly appears chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia.
[00:39:19.492 --> 00:39:21.454]  Lyme disease.
[00:39:21.894 --> 00:39:25.818]  We're talking about about four million Americans having these terrible diseases.
[00:39:25.898 --> 00:39:30.201]  And as you know, doctor, they now admit that Lyme's weaponized came from Plum Island.
[00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:34.525]  They now admit that the bird flu came from there.
[00:39:35.286 --> 00:39:37.107]  Not the bird flu, the West Nile.
[00:39:37.428 --> 00:39:42.572]  But they say it's an accident, but they're going to move it from that island in the Atlantic Ocean to San Antonio, Texas.
[00:39:42.632 --> 00:39:43.093]  What is this
[00:39:43.893 --> 00:39:49.756]  36 level 4 bioweapons labs in the middle of populated areas in level 2 security.
[00:39:50.036 --> 00:39:50.677]  What's that about?
[00:39:50.737 --> 00:39:52.478]  Plausible deniability when they release it?
[00:39:52.978 --> 00:39:56.580]  Well, if something happens, they'll say, oh shucks, we just made another mistake.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.780]  Nobody's responsible.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.202]  Just like Porton Down keeps releasing all this stuff on accident in England.
[00:40:01.957 --> 00:40:07.900]  And, of course, at Fort Dedrick in Maryland, of course, where they work on all these biological warfare agents.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.620]  And that's where the anthrax came from.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.761]  They just love us so much.
[00:40:10.801 --> 00:40:11.501]  That's good people.
[00:40:11.941 --> 00:40:23.266]  Oh, you know, Kirstie, the story about the anthrax, you know, the anthrax attack on America, isn't it interesting that it was only Democratic senators that received the anthrax-laden envelopes?
[00:40:23.366 --> 00:40:27.608]  And isn't it interesting that on the very day of the 9-1-1 attack,
[00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:38.296]  Dick Cheney, the White House staff, and the President started on Cipro, and the only reason you'd take that is if you were expecting an anthrax attack, why would they start on the evening of September 11th?
[00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:45.838]  And it was the New York head of emergency management who's a controlled demolition expert, and tied into controlled demolition the rest of them who recommended they go on it.
[00:40:46.678 --> 00:40:46.898]  Right.
[00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:48.379]  A nice man.
[00:40:49.298 --> 00:40:57.101]  The only reason you would take Cipro, because it's potentially dangerous to antibiotics, is if you knew an anthrax attack was coming.
[00:40:57.281 --> 00:41:02.203]  And if they knew an anthrax attack was coming, why didn't they warn the rest of us?
[00:41:02.323 --> 00:41:04.404]  And some idiots say, well, why would they go on it?
[00:41:04.444 --> 00:41:05.485]  It means they had a tip.
[00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:07.746]  I mean, if they knew right where it was going, why would they go?
[00:41:07.766 --> 00:41:10.527]  If they knew it was going to the Capitol, why would they do it in the White House?
[00:41:10.567 --> 00:41:15.589]  Because they knew it was going through the main Washington mail office where the two workers died.
[00:41:16.689 --> 00:41:19.452]  They knew they had to, even though they were launching the attack.
[00:41:20.292 --> 00:41:27.639]  Dr. Monteith, get into suppressed cancer cures, how the Rockefellers have the corner of the market, the documents and eyewitnesses you have to that.
[00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:33.103]  Well, basically, they have been actively suppressing cancer treatment.
[00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:43.412]  This is covered in a four-tape set we have called The New Order of the Barbarians, where Dr. Richard Day told a group of doctors in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1969
[00:41:44.963 --> 00:41:47.644]  That there were treatments for cancer that were being suppressed.
[00:41:48.264 --> 00:41:50.564]  And of course, there actually was a report.
[00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:52.685]  It was called the Fitzgerald Report.
[00:41:52.725 --> 00:42:00.166]  It was actually put in the Congressional Record back in 1955 about all the suppressed cancer treatments.
[00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:06.287]  And it was interesting, recently, somebody sent me $50 and said, give me a copy of the Fitzgerald Report.
[00:42:06.687 --> 00:42:07.808]  I can't get it anyplace.
[00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:09.468]  It was in the Congressional Record.
[00:42:10.008 --> 00:42:14.069]  Well, I called everybody I knew, the National Health Association,
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:22.007]  You know, the various researches, everybody's heard the Fitzgerald Report, you can read about it on the internet, but nobody had a report.
[00:42:22.547 --> 00:42:36.881]  Eventually we were able to track it down from the Congressional Records, and it's in one of our newsletters, but basically, and people go to RadioLiberty.com and just scroll down on the newsletters for the Fitzgerald Report, but in 1955 they were talking about
[00:42:38.782 --> 00:42:41.868]  Laetrile is an effective treatment for cancer.
[00:42:41.948 --> 00:42:44.093]  They were talking about the Hoxie treatment.
[00:42:44.113 --> 00:42:47.040]  They were talking about several other treatments were available.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.024]  Isn't Laetrile the stuff out of cherries?
[00:42:49.758 --> 00:42:51.700]  No, it's out of apricot pits.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.362]  It's basically a specific vitamin.
[00:42:55.462 --> 00:43:07.872]  Actually, I talked to a man named Dean Burke, and Dean Burke was in charge of chemotherapy research at the National Cancer Institute, which is a subdivision of the NIH.
[00:43:07.972 --> 00:43:10.714]  Of course, I talked to Burke before he died.
[00:43:11.034 --> 00:43:15.898]  He told me that Laetrile did work, they knew it worked, and that
[00:43:16.331 --> 00:43:18.132]  Certainly, it wouldn't cure everybody.
[00:43:18.192 --> 00:43:22.714]  Sometimes people were too far gone, but he said it's far better than anything in chemotherapy.
[00:43:22.734 --> 00:43:26.635]  He said, I've been in chemotherapy research for 25 years.
[00:43:27.056 --> 00:43:31.177]  I have three filing cabinets full of information on Laetrile.
[00:43:31.237 --> 00:43:33.198]  And I said, but what about the Smith?
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.460]  I forgot what it was.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.882]  The Smith, a slowed catering evaluation of Laetrile where they said it didn't work.
[00:43:42.423 --> 00:43:44.424]  He said they actually fudged that.
[00:43:44.905 --> 00:43:46.886]  They knew it worked and so they designed it.
[00:44:03.657 --> 00:44:04.999]  I'm sure it probably is.
[00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:06.460]  It may be in several things.
[00:44:26.218 --> 00:44:27.059]  Yeah, it's very poisonous.
[00:44:49.372 --> 00:44:51.613]  They are actively suppressing treatment.
[00:44:51.633 --> 00:44:53.433]  Now, there are lots of even better treatments.
[00:44:53.713 --> 00:44:56.574]  That was 50 years ago, but they're all being suppressed.
[00:44:56.614 --> 00:45:07.056]  Dr. Brzezinski down in Texas, Houston, Texas, has a treatment that they know will, of course, take care of brain cancers in children, and they will not allow it to be widely used.
[00:45:07.416 --> 00:45:09.437]  In fact, they tried to put Brzezinski in prison.
[00:45:09.577 --> 00:45:09.917]  Why?
[00:45:09.937 --> 00:45:12.678]  Because he was saving the lives of children.
[00:45:13.078 --> 00:45:18.219]  I actually have a four-tape set on Brzezinski's material with interviews with Brzezinski in the book.
[00:45:21.581 --> 00:45:30.364]  And I want you to know this.
[00:45:30.865 --> 00:45:32.125]  People who serve the government.
[00:45:33.946 --> 00:45:35.086]  We've seen a change in the elite.
[00:45:35.106 --> 00:45:35.986]  We're about to go to calls.
[00:45:37.647 --> 00:45:41.168]  I mean, they were evil 20 years ago, but they wouldn't let the troops be around DU.
[00:45:41.248 --> 00:45:41.889]  Now they are.
[00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:44.089]  And the troops are coming back and dying in mass.
[00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.771]  They particularly shoot up the troops with this stuff.
[00:45:48.755 --> 00:45:51.598]  There are thousands of examples of them nerve-gassing our own troops.
[00:45:51.978 --> 00:45:54.341]  That came out in the news again last week, mainstream news.
[00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:58.124]  I mean, murdering them, radiating small children to death.
[00:45:58.144 --> 00:46:06.412]  I mean, there's thousands of cases, and they did that to create the cadres of doctors in government who would carry out other ops.
[00:46:07.293 --> 00:46:12.055]  And I'm going to have to have you back, Dr. Montee, for a full two hours in the near future.
[00:46:12.095 --> 00:46:13.356]  Let's take some phone calls.
[00:46:13.376 --> 00:46:14.336]  They'll be all over the map.
[00:46:14.817 --> 00:46:20.960]  But let's go ahead and, so we can get to some of these, go ahead and take a call from Lynn in Chicago.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:21.620]  You're on the air.
[00:46:24.561 --> 00:46:25.102]  Go ahead, Lynn.
[00:46:25.122 --> 00:46:25.502]  Are you there?
[00:46:25.702 --> 00:46:26.522]  No, Lynn's gone.
[00:46:26.542 --> 00:46:27.803]  Next up is Chris in Minnesota.
[00:46:28.043 --> 00:46:30.664]  We're going to go to Chris in Minnesota.
[00:46:30.704 --> 00:46:31.865]  Go ahead, Chris in Minnesota.
[00:46:32.711 --> 00:46:33.892]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:46:33.932 --> 00:46:39.997]  I'm sure that you're aware of, and I'm sure that your guest, the doctor there, is aware of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
[00:46:40.017 --> 00:46:45.982]  Here is one of the largest and most cutting-edge medical facilities in the United States.
[00:46:46.042 --> 00:46:47.684]  Kings and Queens come here for treatment.
[00:46:48.124 --> 00:46:55.550]  And a friend of mine works for a company who subcontracts to the Mayo Clinic for delivering, making deliveries.
[00:46:56.111 --> 00:47:00.815]  And he had to take a delivery the other day to this secluded place just on the outskirts of town.
[00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:12.538]  And he's told me that it was covered with armed guard security and the rumor, I guess, is that it's a pig farm, that they harvest organs in the pigs.
[00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:16.183]  They're growing organs for organ transplants for humans.
[00:47:17.929 --> 00:47:19.770]  Well, sir, there's no rumor.
[00:47:20.291 --> 00:47:25.295]  In utero, in pigs and cows, they grow humanoids.
[00:47:25.375 --> 00:47:26.416]  You can't really call them that.
[00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:30.118]  It's ganglia from the doctors we've talked to.
[00:47:30.139 --> 00:47:31.219]  There's different processes.
[00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:36.203]  A lot of times it is humanoids and they harvest the organs out of them in utero.
[00:47:36.504 --> 00:47:37.424]  Babies, basically.
[00:47:37.444 --> 00:47:39.146]  And that's actually in the news.
[00:47:39.306 --> 00:47:44.250]  Or sometimes it's just groups of organs within the pigs and cows.
[00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.452]  Dr. Montee, would you like to speak to that?
[00:47:47.113 --> 00:47:56.077]  Well, certainly we know that they're injecting human genes into the brains of animals, of mice, so that they will actually have a human brain.
[00:47:56.097 --> 00:48:01.379]  The things that they're doing today are just totally in violation of God's plan for humanity.
[00:48:01.859 --> 00:48:09.962]  We have a book called The Aramont Cape, which is a fictionalized story of how they actually are cloning a human animal brain.
[00:48:10.302 --> 00:48:11.063]  They're clones.
[00:48:11.103 --> 00:48:12.746]  They're actually doing this.
[00:48:26.356 --> 00:48:38.384]  What we're doing, of course, is we're violating all the laws of nature and, of course, we're going to be creating new Frankenstein-type... But on top of that, the general public isn't going to get access to this, and they also harvest our baby's blood.
[00:48:38.864 --> 00:48:41.566]  Then, if they need it, they'll kidnap your kid for their organs.
[00:48:41.606 --> 00:48:42.606]  We know that's going on.
[00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:44.488]  That's why they want the blood samples at birth.
[00:48:44.528 --> 00:48:47.369]  The idiot doctors locally are compartmentalized and don't know.
[00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.771]  Did your friend say anything else about this facility?
[00:48:51.434 --> 00:48:52.074]  He dropped off.
[00:48:52.094 --> 00:48:53.575]  Okay, let's go to Warren in Michigan.
[00:48:53.935 --> 00:48:57.176]  Warren in Michigan, you're on the air with Jack Elliott, Ollie and Mark.
[00:48:57.196 --> 00:48:58.836]  Go ahead, Warren, you're on the air with Dr. Monteith.
[00:48:59.716 --> 00:49:01.637]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[00:49:02.317 --> 00:49:04.258]  I'm sorry I'm not more prepared for your guest.
[00:49:04.518 --> 00:49:05.638]  I listen to the podcast.
[00:49:05.698 --> 00:49:08.539]  I'm a day behind, so it's very interesting stuff.
[00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:09.399]  Go ahead and make your point.
[00:49:09.459 --> 00:49:14.241]  I can make the comment that I lost an aunt of mine to ovarian cancer.
[00:49:14.441 --> 00:49:18.602]  It's just amazing to me, you know, being woken up very recently, that
[00:49:19.733 --> 00:49:28.217]  She was battling the cancer and then was obviously more heavily battling the treatment and that's what her life was lost.
[00:49:28.317 --> 00:49:31.219]  So it's, to me, that's a lot of pressure.
[00:49:31.959 --> 00:49:35.921]  I have to understand that many times the treatments do far more harm than good.
[00:49:36.241 --> 00:49:41.304]  Because the chemotherapy suppresses the immune system and can produce cancer itself.
[00:49:41.404 --> 00:49:45.746]  Radiation can suppress the immune system and create cancer itself.
[00:49:46.126 --> 00:49:49.188]  And of course there are natural treatments for a lot of these things.
[00:49:49.648 --> 00:49:52.510]  But people are going to have to get it in the United States.
[00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:55.912]  You're not going to get it in this country, because they want our people to die.
[00:49:55.952 --> 00:50:01.936]  They are using us as guinea pigs for so many things, and the average American has no grasp of what's going on.
[00:50:01.956 --> 00:50:03.117]  Well, doctor, take HPV.
[00:50:03.137 --> 00:50:07.520]  I know you can speak to that, but their own insert with the live cancer virus drug.
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:08.340]  It's a live virus.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:15.605]  It says this actually gives you an increase in cancer, and it doesn't even protect you from the HPV, but they run out and take it.
[00:50:16.807 --> 00:50:25.894]  And how foolish people are to be taking this so-called cancer vaccine so that they can go out and be promiscuous.
[00:50:26.514 --> 00:50:32.439]  And of course we're going to destroy the lives of literally millions of our young people by doing this.
[00:50:33.456 --> 00:50:38.158]  We're going to talk behind the scenes for Prison Planet and Infowars.com stream listeners.
[00:50:38.178 --> 00:50:40.439]  We're going to be right back for everybody else.
[00:50:40.459 --> 00:50:45.022]  We're going to talk to Warren, Elliot, Ollie, and Mark before Dr. Monteef leaves us.
[00:50:45.422 --> 00:50:46.262]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:50.364 --> 00:50:52.565]  Okay, Doc, let's continue taking calls here.
[00:50:53.526 --> 00:50:54.226]  Let's talk now.
[00:50:54.266 --> 00:50:55.547]  We just talked to Warren, didn't we?
[00:50:55.567 --> 00:50:58.728]  Let's talk to Elliot in Ohio.
[00:50:58.808 --> 00:51:00.269]  Elliot, you're on the air with Dr. Monteef.
[00:51:02.654 --> 00:51:02.914]  Hello?
[00:51:03.175 --> 00:51:03.736]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:51:05.398 --> 00:51:07.120]  Yeah, Alex, I got a question.
[00:51:07.201 --> 00:51:16.374]  Like, I've been studying up on, you know, just Merck putting cancer in the HPV vaccines and, you know, how it was spread through the Hepatitis B vaccines.
[00:51:16.434 --> 00:51:19.218]  Now, what about, like, just Tetris shots and just
[00:51:20.137 --> 00:51:21.378]  Tetanus are some of the worst.
[00:51:21.418 --> 00:51:32.043]  They add a very expensive synthetic hormone that is excreted during the start of the second trimester, and so somehow, the doctor can explain this, but they admit this has been admitted.
[00:51:32.363 --> 00:51:36.024]  They've been caught all over Latin America, Africa, and Asia, guaranteed going on in the U.S.
[00:51:36.425 --> 00:51:43.948]  Then the body attacks the glands that secrete the real hormone, because they've bound the hormone into the tetanus pathogen.
[00:51:44.288 --> 00:51:45.649]  Dr. Monteef, can you speak to that?
[00:51:46.243 --> 00:51:50.524]  Well, basically, you're speaking now, of course, to create abortions.
[00:51:50.544 --> 00:51:54.706]  You're talking about they put in a choreogram out of trophine into the vaccines.
[00:51:54.746 --> 00:51:55.866]  They've done this in India.
[00:51:56.326 --> 00:52:02.088]  I've talked to doctors from both the Philippines and Kenya where they introduced these.
[00:52:02.368 --> 00:52:05.489]  They told the women that these were for tetanus.
[00:52:05.889 --> 00:52:07.590]  So your children won't get tetanus.
[00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:08.090]  You won't.
[00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:09.590]  Just roll up your sleeve.
[00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:11.851]  We're here from the World Health Organization to help you.
[00:52:12.421 --> 00:52:27.785]  But these vaccines contained a chorionidotrophic sensitizing the woman's body to it, so when she got pregnant and began to put out the chorionidotrophic, her immune system destroyed her own chorionidotrophic, and of course she would abort her child.
[00:52:29.066 --> 00:52:36.748]  This is totally inhuman, they did not tell the woman they were doing this, but this is part of this program of population control.
[00:52:37.428 --> 00:52:46.938]  I saw one in Myanmar confirmed where the police come by and make the women take three tetanus shots, which real tetanus is only one shot, while they're pregnant and they all miscarry.
[00:52:47.158 --> 00:52:49.381]  They even run murder ops on the pregnant women.
[00:52:50.612 --> 00:52:59.595]  And they're using coercive population control techniques all over the world, and it is all funded, or almost all funded, with American taxpayer dollars.
[00:52:59.635 --> 00:53:01.295]  We call it family planning.
[00:53:01.736 --> 00:53:05.417]  It is really coercive and genocidal population control.
[00:53:05.697 --> 00:53:08.598]  And Dr. Monteith, those people are watching right now on the web.
[00:53:08.618 --> 00:53:09.118]  They're watching.
[00:53:09.158 --> 00:53:09.918]  They love what they're doing.
[00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:13.259]  What do you have to say to the demons that murder these babies?
[00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:16.680]  Well, one day they're going to have to stand before the bar of judgment.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.360]  We all will.
[00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:18.921]  And I would hate to be in their shoes.
[00:53:19.824 --> 00:53:20.184]  That's right.
[00:53:20.205 --> 00:53:22.107]  They can kill our bodies, but they aren't getting our souls.
[00:53:22.147 --> 00:53:25.171]  And I fear He who can destroy the soul, not He who can destroy the body.
[00:53:25.772 --> 00:53:26.332]  Amen to that.
[00:53:26.593 --> 00:53:27.254]  We are committed.
[00:53:27.294 --> 00:53:28.675]  Does that answer your question, Elliot?
[00:53:30.177 --> 00:53:30.758]  Yes, it does.
[00:53:30.858 --> 00:53:31.199]  Thank you.
[00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:32.331]  You bet.
[00:53:32.351 --> 00:53:33.593]  You just heard it from a medical doctor.
[00:53:33.613 --> 00:53:38.559]  They've been caught red-handed from India to Africa to Latin America, Peru, you name it.
[00:53:38.579 --> 00:53:40.661]  100% sterilization every time the woman tries to have a baby.
[00:53:41.001 --> 00:53:41.923]  Violent miscarriage.
[00:53:42.243 --> 00:53:47.409]  It also is associated with a high mortality in the women because of the infections it's set in.
[00:53:47.749 --> 00:53:50.833]  And it also causes inflammation in the gland that secretes the hormone.
[00:53:51.113 --> 00:53:51.494]  Here we go.
[00:53:57.315 --> 00:54:00.037]  For those behind the scenes, the information was so important.
[00:54:00.077 --> 00:54:04.119]  He was getting into how they add hormones to the tetanus shots to sterilize you women.
[00:54:04.499 --> 00:54:05.480]  Absolutely documented.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.662]  Been caught red-handed by medical research facilities all over the world.
[00:54:08.682 --> 00:54:11.223]  We're going to try to cram in a few final calls.
[00:54:11.423 --> 00:54:12.444]  Ollie in Canada.
[00:54:13.064 --> 00:54:15.306]  Ollie, you're on the air with Dr. Stan Monteith.
[00:54:16.026 --> 00:54:16.646]  Yeah, hi.
[00:54:16.826 --> 00:54:20.989]  Alex, I have a question first off for Doc.
[00:54:21.587 --> 00:54:23.027]  Doc, do you have a website?
[00:54:23.347 --> 00:54:50.853]  RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com RadioLiberty.com
[00:54:51.929 --> 00:54:57.352]  The best way to beat cancer is to aid the immune system.
[00:54:57.653 --> 00:54:59.053]  Did they ever mention that?
[00:54:59.294 --> 00:54:59.574]  No.
[00:54:59.774 --> 00:55:05.657]  No, we were taught because you do surgery, you do chemotherapy, you do radiation.
[00:55:05.918 --> 00:55:07.378]  Burn it, cut it, poison it.
[00:55:07.819 --> 00:55:11.321]  It's always to treat the final equation.
[00:55:11.361 --> 00:55:13.982]  Never prevent or never use the body to heal anything.
[00:55:14.082 --> 00:55:15.383]  That's the school of medicine.
[00:55:15.984 --> 00:55:21.407]  Doc, you know, I'm so surprised that you actually said that because I have
[00:55:21.872 --> 00:55:24.334]  There are so many doctors in my own family.
[00:55:24.994 --> 00:55:29.978]  Like, I have my aunts, my uncles, they're all doctors, but they're not in the United States.
[00:55:30.158 --> 00:55:30.759]  They're elsewhere.
[00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:35.382]  And I've had enough of my relatives die from cancer.
[00:55:35.863 --> 00:55:40.546]  And one of them happened to be the first wife of my uncle.
[00:55:40.566 --> 00:55:41.487]  Alright, I've got to jump.
[00:55:41.507 --> 00:55:42.167]  The show's over.
[00:55:42.408 --> 00:55:42.808]  Thank you, sir.
[00:55:42.828 --> 00:55:43.609]  I've got to let you go.
[00:55:43.949 --> 00:55:46.591]  Dr. Monteith, I want to thank you for spending time with us.
[00:55:46.611 --> 00:55:49.193]  I want to have you back up for two hours in the near future.
[00:55:49.453 --> 00:55:50.414]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[00:55:51.236 --> 00:55:52.077]  I always enjoy it.
[00:55:52.097 --> 00:55:52.497]  God bless.
[00:55:52.738 --> 00:55:52.998]  Bye-bye.
[00:55:53.038 --> 00:55:53.378]  Take care.
[00:55:53.398 --> 00:55:55.140]  We'll have him up for two hours in the near future.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:55.540]  Great guy.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:56.661]  RadioLiberty.com.
[00:55:56.941 --> 00:55:58.222]  It's all documented with him.
[00:55:58.683 --> 00:55:59.464]  All documented.
[00:55:59.864 --> 00:56:00.565]  All documented.
[00:56:00.805 --> 00:56:01.806]  Do you understand, women?
[00:56:01.826 --> 00:56:02.927]  That's why you can't have babies.
[00:56:02.947 --> 00:56:04.908]  You've been hit hard with sterilization compounds.
[00:56:05.189 --> 00:56:06.910]  Your daughters are out taking this HPV.
[00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:08.211]  It's hurting them bad.
[00:56:08.552 --> 00:56:10.734]  That you're under attack now!
[00:56:11.054 --> 00:56:11.634]  Period!
[00:56:12.475 --> 00:56:13.816]  People say, oh, don't get so upset.
[00:56:14.196 --> 00:56:15.157]  We need to get upset.
[00:56:15.197 --> 00:56:16.338]  We need to shake out of it.
[00:56:16.799 --> 00:56:18.680]  Shake out of the days and realize.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.462]  I mean, I looked at Eric Prince, the head of Blackwater.
[00:56:21.022 --> 00:56:22.723]  His 30-year-old wife died of cancer.
[00:56:23.264 --> 00:56:24.885]  I mean, just everybody's dying of this stuff.
[00:56:24.925 --> 00:56:25.826]  It's like the flu now.
[00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:29.229]  1 in 33 used to die of it, now 1 in 3.
[00:56:29.269 --> 00:56:30.350]  They're saying 1 in 2.
[00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.472]  We're all going to die while these bastards soft kill us.
[00:56:33.913 --> 00:56:35.614]  Although they're all living to be 103.
[00:56:36.835 --> 00:56:39.197]  Probably staging their own death, these pieces of filth.
[00:56:43.243 --> 00:56:44.844]  I had a lot of key guests on today.
[00:56:44.864 --> 00:56:46.745]  Retransmission starts here in a few minutes.
[00:56:46.885 --> 00:56:47.925]  I hope you get Truth Rising.
[00:56:47.945 --> 00:56:49.906]  It won't be a big film without you.
[00:56:49.946 --> 00:56:58.850]  Truth Rising, my new film about 9-11 and how they're demonizing 9-11 truth and how we're countering them and all the celebrities we interview and all the globalists that are confronted.
[00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.170]  It is the must-see film.
[00:57:00.611 --> 00:57:01.291]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:01.311 --> 00:57:04.132]  And if you have the film, I want you to make copies of it.
[00:57:10.908 --> 00:57:22.936]  Another sponsor that makes this show possible is a great water filter system that all you need is electricity and it grabs gallons and gallons and gallons and gallons even in the desert of water out of the air every single day.
[00:57:24.437 --> 00:57:25.378]  It is Ecoloblue.
[00:57:25.838 --> 00:57:28.300]  The website is Ecoloblue.com.
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.123]  Big fat banner in the middle of Infowars.com.
[00:57:31.443 --> 00:57:32.944]  Ecoloblue.com.
[00:57:33.044 --> 00:57:35.086]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com.
[00:57:35.607 --> 00:57:36.808]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you 1-866-585-4044.
[00:57:41.972 --> 00:57:43.793]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[00:57:43.873 --> 00:57:47.634]  Pays for itself within one year if you buy from your water at the store.
[00:57:47.834 --> 00:57:49.414]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[00:57:49.474 --> 00:57:50.395]  Five filters in it.
[00:57:51.095 --> 00:57:52.415]  You do gotta clean it out once a month.
[00:57:52.455 --> 00:57:54.116]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[00:57:54.136 --> 00:57:55.576]  1-866-585-4044.
[00:57:55.756 --> 00:57:58.437]  We got one in the office.
[00:57:58.977 --> 00:58:00.398]  Great tasting, pure H2O.
[00:58:00.438 --> 00:58:01.778]  Exactly the way nature makes it.
[00:58:02.118 --> 00:58:03.619]  No chemicals, pollutants or toxins.
[00:58:03.659 --> 00:58:04.019]  Natural pH.
[00:58:04.039 --> 00:58:04.079]  866-585-4044.
[00:58:04.119 --> 00:58:05.759]  Like I said, this isn't a game.
[00:58:05.819 --> 00:58:06.420]  It's not a joke!
[00:58:12.011 --> 00:58:16.314]  I need everybody to spread the word about the Internet Screams at InfoWars.com and the free podcast.
[00:58:16.974 --> 00:58:18.915]  The AM and FM stations were on the shortwave.
[00:58:19.235 --> 00:58:24.198]  We are the most important show out there because we tell it like it is, and we know what the key issues are.
[00:58:25.079 --> 00:58:25.399]  Okay?
[00:58:25.419 --> 00:58:29.422]  Not repeating groups' names over and over again, but exposing what they're doing and warning people.
[00:58:29.682 --> 00:58:30.963]  Retransmission starts now!
[00:58:31.203 --> 00:58:32.944]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
