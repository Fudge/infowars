[00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:01.256]  Yes, sir.
[00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:02.917]  Twelve after, he'll be ready.
[00:00:02.997 --> 00:00:03.638]  All right.
[00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.402]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up in 15 minutes.
[00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:16.025]  For TV viewers, we just started transmitting, streaming live for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:25.078]  Folks watching this later as an archive, we had a caller earlier that said, well the Federal Reserve rules over us, it's private, but isn't that what the Bible says we should do?
[00:00:25.098 --> 00:00:34.927]  I mean, you know, it's don't stand up against slavery, don't not take the mercury-filled shots, don't not drink the fluoride water, whatever government says is God.
[00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:43.235]  And I wanted to call my uncle, who's one of the best Bible scholars I know, William Hammond, and have him comment, but Butch Paw, who's a talk show host right here on the network, a pastor,
[00:00:45.347 --> 00:00:48.548]  He's also an expert on this and made some documentaries about it, called in.
[00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:53.230]  So we've got this segment and part of the next before Dr. Roberts comes on, because I wanted to address this now.
[00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.511]  And I wanted to go to my uncle, William.
[00:00:57.152 --> 00:01:04.514]  Go ahead and just spend a few minutes giving people verses or try to explain to this person that it's... I mean, I'm not even a Bible expert.
[00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.595]  The whole Bible is about standing up against tyranny.
[00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:08.296]  What's going on with these people?
[00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:10.297]  Talk to me Alex, I'm sorry.
[00:01:10.317 --> 00:01:12.177]  No, I'm going to go to my uncle first, William.
[00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:13.038]  Go ahead, I'll be right here.
[00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:14.951]  Hello, everybody.
[00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:25.316]  All through history, both in the Bible and with most theologians, there's been the concept of just war, just resistance, unjust war, unjust resistance.
[00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:43.023]  And the Word of God is pretty clear that wars, just wars, involve defense, whereas unjust wars and unjust resistance involves aggression or open rebellion for rebellion's sake or for material reasons.
[00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:50.992]  So, in the Word of God, we see that we're always juggling with this, and we are to obey.
[00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:53.153]  Romans 13 has that kernel of truth.
[00:01:53.233 --> 00:02:13.244]  However, when the government is clearly violating every single tenet of the Word of God, and that which the Constitution and the nation was established upon, right down to our right to life of our unborn babies, and our right to defend our own lives, then we know
[00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:19.548]  That we're bumping up against unjust activity and the activities of an aggressor.
[00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:34.538]  There is a scripture that says at the end in the kingdom that the swords will be beaten into plowshares, but there's also an Old Testament scripture calling for a just war that says, beat your plowshares into swords.
[00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:38.060]  And Jesus himself said at the very end of his ministry,
[00:02:39.315 --> 00:02:46.140]  When he was advising his disciples and his apostles, he said, if you've got two coats, sell one and buy a sword.
[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:55.566]  So he recognized that there was going to be terrible resistance to truth and righteousness, and it wasn't to be taken lying down doing nothing.
[00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:57.748]  Okay, now stop there because I'm going to bring you guys back.
[00:02:57.808 --> 00:02:58.908]  Butch, give them some verses.
[00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:06.674]  Well, if you go to 2 Kings chapter 11, you'll find in there very clearly where Jehody, the high priest of the day, the preacher, the head preacher,
[00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:07.888]  I think?
[00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.242]  Those powers are to be ministers of God to our good.
[00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:27.185]  That word ministry, it means deacon.
[00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:32.470]  The government itself is to be a deacon to glorify God and edify the good of the people.
[00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:42.041]  If it ceases to do good, it ceases to be righteous government, and then we are required, by God's law and His commandments, to resist that evil by all means necessary.
[00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:47.869]  And Bush, the whole Bible, I don't know where to start, is about people standing up against evil.
[00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.770]  Again, the whole Bible is written on Nehemiah chapter 4.
[00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.611]  It talks about resisting evil.
[00:03:55.071 --> 00:04:00.432]  In the Old Testament, Christ, as your uncle said, told his disciples, Luke 22, verse 36, to buy a sword.
[00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.392]  That wasn't for slicing cheese and cleaning toenails.
[00:04:02.412 --> 00:04:03.313]  That was for fighting with.
[00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:09.274]  These are things that are clearly written in the Scriptures, and people have got to quit listening to these manby-pamby pulpit pimps.
[00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:11.623]  They're getting paid to tickle their ears.
[00:04:12.023 --> 00:04:13.364]  Understand, we're here to fight evil.
[00:04:13.384 --> 00:04:14.966]  We're here to expose it and fight it.
[00:04:15.707 --> 00:04:17.869]  Paul wrote Romans 13 from prison.
[00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.150]  Why was he in prison?
[00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.452]  For obeying Caesar or for disobeying Caesar?
[00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.034]  Why did they kill so many of the prophets?
[00:04:24.094 --> 00:04:27.277]  Why did they do all that if they were to follow and grovel to government?
[00:04:27.798 --> 00:04:30.120]  And by this extension, the Founding Fathers are bad.
[00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:33.964]  Fighting Hitler was bad because it's all of God, isn't it?
[00:04:34.468 --> 00:04:43.435]  Well, if people just take time to look the Bible for what it says and quit trying to weasel away around this, they are accountable for the evil around them.
[00:04:43.495 --> 00:04:47.558]  If we are not fighting evil, we're not doing the will of our Father.
[00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:49.640]  Well, you're aiding it and the blood is on your hands.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.182]  I want to talk behind the scenes for the internet listeners right now.
[00:04:52.202 --> 00:04:53.063]  We're going to skip this break.
[00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:54.444]  Everybody else will be right back.
[00:05:00.854 --> 00:05:07.158]  Guys, I know this is on really short notice, but it's crazy.
[00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:10.040]  All the prophets are being killed, put in prison.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.003]  They're refusing to do what evil kings say in Israel, outside Israel, Babylon, Egypt.
[00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:18.585]  According to them, they should have done what Pharaoh said.
[00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:22.848]  They should have done what all of them said.
[00:05:22.928 --> 00:05:26.230]  Jesus should have done what the high priest and Herod said.
[00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.913]  I mean, this is unbelievable, and it's taught
[00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:37.415]  Everywhere, to not even warn people, because that's speaking out against the government, to take your shots, let them kill you, do whatever they say.
[00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:40.015]  It's insanity, it's unbiblical.
[00:05:40.595 --> 00:05:46.537]  And I'll make one comment, your uncle can talk all he likes to, because this is a point that is so, so important today.
[00:05:46.977 --> 00:05:57.079]  That if we render to Caesar what is not Caesar's, on my website, PastorButch.com, there's a three hour video, anybody can watch for free, entitled, Render to Caesar Explained.
[00:05:57.498 --> 00:06:03.559]  If we give unto Him what is not His, we make Caesar our God, we deny our God, and hell is our damnation.
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.320]  It's just that simple.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.301]  And going back to my uncle, do you want to make some more comments here?
[00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:24.564]  Well, not only is the Bible on our side, but history is on our side as believers, because in a practical sense, Christianity would not exist today if no resistance had taken place throughout history.
[00:06:25.103 --> 00:06:28.646]  Look at what the Romans tried to do to the believers.
[00:06:29.046 --> 00:06:29.986]  It's almost unspeakable.
[00:06:30.027 --> 00:06:35.570]  They should have followed what the Emperor said and worshipped Saturn and Mars right there.
[00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.852]  They are bad, according to what that guy said.
[00:06:38.312 --> 00:06:40.574]  They should have made sacrifices for the Roman gods.
[00:06:40.674 --> 00:06:44.317]  Well, the point I just made was that Paul wrote most of the New Testament from prison.
[00:06:44.477 --> 00:06:45.958]  He lived in prison for obeying Caesar.
[00:06:45.998 --> 00:06:47.779]  He was there because he did not obey Caesar.
[00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.982]  In Numbers chapter 1, Numbers is called the war book in the Bible.
[00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:56.857]  Numbers chapter one is where our forefathers got the idea of a militia, civilian military.
[00:06:57.197 --> 00:07:05.405]  This is where our forefathers said we will establish a civilian militia in our country to protect our states and our nation.
[00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:06.106]  That's in their Bible.
[00:07:06.126 --> 00:07:06.947]  Well let me stop you.
[00:07:07.348 --> 00:07:08.849]  Going back to
[00:07:10.697 --> 00:07:21.123]  The Founding Fathers, going back to the Bible, Paul was somebody who hunted down and killed Christians until he got knocked off his horse and became Paul from Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus.
[00:07:21.183 --> 00:07:26.146]  So there it is that Christians weren't following orders, he was going around hunting them down.
[00:07:26.586 --> 00:07:27.066]  Exactly.
[00:07:27.927 --> 00:07:37.832]  They were resisting the civil authorities and the church of the day, and the church of the day, very good point, the so-called church, because they would not go along with the customs of the church.
[00:07:38.174 --> 00:07:39.215]  They said this is not right.
[00:07:39.295 --> 00:07:41.276]  Christ is the Messiah.
[00:07:41.756 --> 00:07:44.018]  They were being persecuted by the church and by the civil authority.
[00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:46.159]  And we are today also a percent of the truth.
[00:07:46.179 --> 00:07:48.641]  All right, we're going to come back to the main audience in 15 seconds.
[00:07:49.762 --> 00:07:52.123]  And so recap other key points.
[00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:53.644]  Both of you got about two minutes apiece.
[00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:57.247]  On the other side, we'll go back to my uncle, William, and then to you, Butch.
[00:07:57.787 --> 00:07:58.568]  Right now, here we go.
[00:08:01.374 --> 00:08:06.996]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:14.238]  Paul himself was Saul of Tarsus, went around hunting down and killing Christians because they wouldn't submit to the civil or the religious authority.
[00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:19.980]  And then of course he got knocked off his horse on the way to Damascus, saw the light, was imprisoned.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.101]  I mean, how did Paul end up?
[00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:23.841]  How did the other disciples end up?
[00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:28.903]  My uncle, William Hammond, and of course Basher Butchpaw, Genesis Network host at 8 o'clock at 9 central,
[00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:37.064]  I want my uncle to have a two-minute closing comment and then Butch, then we're going to get Dr. Paul Gregg Roberts on right now.
[00:08:38.425 --> 00:08:38.825]  Thank you.
[00:08:39.145 --> 00:08:50.554]  We were looking at the historical perspective and we've come down to the Inquisition, which was a coldly calculated move for about 800 or 900 years to totally wipe out true Christianity.
[00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:55.518]  If there had been no resistance, again, Christianity would not exist today.
[00:08:55.959 --> 00:09:01.083]  And moving to the tyranny of the kings of England, had there been no resistance to the kings,
[00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:07.678]  There would have been no America because the people came here to found this place looking for freedom of faith.
[00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:09.800]  Look at Martin Luther.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:21.529]  If he had not been, not Martin Luther King, Martin Luther of the Reformation, if Martin Luther had not been backed by the arms of the German princes, there would have been no Reformation.
[00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:24.612]  It would have been swept away in a few days by the papal armies.
[00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:26.613]  So there was a lot of resistance there.
[00:09:26.673 --> 00:09:28.415]  And finally, I'd like to say
[00:09:28.837 --> 00:09:34.800]  That when Jesus comes back, and it's very soon, it's at the door, he's not coming back as a lamb.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:46.846]  He's coming back as a Lion of Judah with 10,000 times 10,000 saints with a mighty sword to wipe out his enemies completely at the Battle of Armageddon.
[00:09:47.046 --> 00:09:49.567]  I would call that total resistance, wouldn't you, Alex?
[00:09:50.293 --> 00:09:50.613]  Amen.
[00:09:52.054 --> 00:09:57.577]  I just don't understand, Bush, the groveling, chicken-necked love of tyranny.
[00:09:57.657 --> 00:10:02.479]  And they always have the same voice, the same spirit of, oh, the Bible says lay down.
[00:10:02.499 --> 00:10:06.141]  And it's just like, oh, they're just like, oh.
[00:10:06.461 --> 00:10:08.002]  I mean, what has happened to these people?
[00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:09.463]  They have been brainwashed.
[00:10:09.623 --> 00:10:10.523]  They are brainwashed.
[00:10:10.683 --> 00:10:12.224]  That's the simplest way I can put it.
[00:10:12.244 --> 00:10:13.785]  They've been brainwashed by their pastors.
[00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:15.597]  They do not say the word for themselves.
[00:10:17.078 --> 00:10:20.181]  They're also afraid, and they think laying down is going to keep them safe.
[00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:23.023]  Well, they're waiting for the rapture.
[00:10:23.043 --> 00:10:23.784]  They're not concerned.
[00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:24.324]  They're waiting.
[00:10:24.364 --> 00:10:25.906]  They don't want to do anything, get involved.
[00:10:25.946 --> 00:10:26.987]  They don't want to lose their stuff.
[00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:31.470]  They worship the God of this world and their possession more than they worship the Almighty.
[00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.393]  And I'm telling you again, the damnation is going to be their just reward.
[00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:40.958]  But again, as I told you a few minutes ago, that in Numbers chapter 1, our forefathers got the idea of a civilian militia.
[00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:46.732]  The 2nd Amendment was given a constitution for us, for the duty for us to overthrow unrighteous leaders.
[00:10:46.832 --> 00:10:49.114]  It's our duty, it's not just our right, it's our duty.
[00:10:49.454 --> 00:10:54.318]  This is a Christian duty to glorify our God all through history.
[00:10:54.859 --> 00:11:02.364]  All through history, the battle has always been for mankind to overthrow unjust tyrants for the sake of freedom.
[00:11:02.725 --> 00:11:06.888]  And Christ came to give us all freedom, for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:16.205]  And until we stand, and there's liberty, until we stand for that, as men and women who defy men who try to be gods, we do not deserve freedom.
[00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:18.166]  We deserve what we're getting.
[00:11:18.326 --> 00:11:18.806]  Absolutely.
[00:11:19.086 --> 00:11:22.808]  God help the people that don't understand it, because I promise you, payday's coming.
[00:11:23.028 --> 00:11:23.428]  I hear you.
[00:11:23.488 --> 00:11:24.529]  Gentlemen, thanks for joining us.
[00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:42.604]  And that really is, thank you, that really is the crux of the problem, that you have tens of billions of dollars, 26,000 now, they're done a double that number by next year, FEMA pastors, we told you this one was secret, it's now public, trained to tell their flocks, turn your guns in, go to FEMA camps, let the government take your children.
[00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:50.671]  I mean, this is right out of Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and that's why, one of the main reasons we can't get this country moving,
[00:11:51.756 --> 00:12:00.018]  Is that the churches are bought and paid for by these corporate interests and are out there spewing the line of this government.
[00:12:00.898 --> 00:12:03.799]  And I am just completely blown away by it.
[00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:08.300]  Every time one of those people calls in and says, if you're a Christian, you're supposed to not stand up against tyranny.
[00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:11.261]  And it's just totally crazy.
[00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:17.923]  Number one, I had a financial guest on, talking about financial news, and this guy calls in saying, you know, we basically shouldn't even criticize the Federal Reserve.
[00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:20.177]  Because God says don't.
[00:12:20.217 --> 00:12:22.238]  I mean, I just can't handle this anymore.
[00:12:22.938 --> 00:12:25.179]  I mean, it's just so crazy.
[00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.960]  Now, if you want to go off in a ditch and be a slave, go ahead.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.140]  Just get out of my way.
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.640]  Get behind me.
[00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:32.221]  Do we have Dr. Roberts?
[00:12:33.021 --> 00:12:33.561]  He's all set.
[00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:35.102]  Okay, thank you so much.
[00:12:36.089 --> 00:12:37.610]  Got late today with our guest.
[00:12:37.651 --> 00:12:40.753]  I appreciate all the guests moving back ten minutes, because Ron Paul was going to be on earlier.
[00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:44.897]  He had to move it to the middle of another interview, so that is why we're a little bit behind.
[00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:53.125]  I'm very honored to have former Wall Street Journal Associate Editor, best-selling author, the father of Reaganomics, head of policy, Department of Treasury.
[00:12:53.145 --> 00:12:59.871]  That was number two under Ronald Reagan, and syndicated columnist with a great syndicated column group out there.
[00:13:00.865 --> 00:13:07.447]  You can just simply Google the name Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and see his stuff in hundreds of great publications.
[00:13:07.507 --> 00:13:19.372]  Liberal, conservative, libertarian, anybody who is informed reads Dr. Roberts' columns that come out several times a week and we link to those over at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and his second edition
[00:13:20.172 --> 00:13:20.413]  Hello, Alex.
[00:13:38.226 --> 00:13:45.968]  Hey, just a side issue before we get into the economy and Conyers blocking a real impeachment hearing coming up this Friday.
[00:13:46.008 --> 00:13:47.168]  We had Kucinich on yesterday.
[00:13:47.648 --> 00:14:00.332]  What do you think of all these mainline Christians that call into shows, I'm sure you've heard them, I know you've written about them, saying, do whatever government says, Romans 13, don't fight tyranny, torture's good, kill all the Iraqis, it's of the Lord.
[00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:06.074]  Now they're getting so crazy, Pastor Hagee saying Jesus isn't even the Savior.
[00:14:06.154 --> 00:14:10.135]  I mean, I know you don't get into religious stuff, but the point is, it's really getting wacky right now.
[00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:25.000]  Oh yeah, what passes for evangelical Christianity is a far more barbaric and warlike religion than what they claim Islam is.
[00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:29.482]  So I see these people as a great threat to humanity.
[00:14:30.174 --> 00:14:31.215]  They're certainly not Christians.
[00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:33.096]  There's nothing Christian about them.
[00:14:33.156 --> 00:14:33.877]  They're thugs.
[00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:38.740]  They want to murder women and children and drop nukes on people that they don't even know.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.482]  I don't know what to make of it.
[00:14:42.543 --> 00:14:50.929]  It sounds like that they're about as crazy as that sect that went down there, whatever it was, Jonathan Jones.
[00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:57.275]  Well, I mean, we hear this mantra.
[00:14:57.295 --> 00:15:07.518]  In fact, I even heard a guy on the network yesterday on another show saying that Ahmadinejad wants nuclear war, has a bomb, is going to nuke Israel, Israel's defenseless.
[00:15:07.538 --> 00:15:09.378]  Well, how does he know anything like that?
[00:15:09.398 --> 00:15:12.319]  He obviously doesn't have any information.
[00:15:12.959 --> 00:15:14.600]  Saying whatever comes into his head.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.461]  Well, that's my question.
[00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:24.505]  Pat Robertson got up yesterday, we have the clip, and said they're going to get the A-bomb, Israel has to hit them, it's of the Lord, and this is the same group that lied about Iraq.
[00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:25.306]  It's of the Lord.
[00:15:26.266 --> 00:15:28.307]  Look, Alex, these are not Christians.
[00:15:28.548 --> 00:15:30.208]  These are murderers and liars.
[00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:31.589]  They're thugs.
[00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.850]  They're worse than the Nazis.
[00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:35.451]  They're not Christians.
[00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:40.034]  There's nothing Christian or religious about them.
[00:15:41.214 --> 00:15:41.995]  They're thugs.
[00:15:42.643 --> 00:15:43.283]  Murderers.
[00:15:43.763 --> 00:15:44.324]  Liars.
[00:15:45.704 --> 00:15:51.106]  They're a great threat to the continued existence of life on Earth.
[00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:52.146]  No, I agree with you.
[00:15:52.186 --> 00:16:01.810]  I'm saying, I understand the kingpins are just manipulating their minions and are secular, but my point is, how do they get all these little church ladies to just be complete pea brains?
[00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.290]  It's mind control.
[00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.191]  Because they're pea brains to start with.
[00:16:07.171 --> 00:16:08.572]  Look, Alex, never forget.
[00:16:09.099 --> 00:16:14.200]  That at least half the population is under the left side of the bell curve.
[00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:21.982]  And I sometimes think, Alex, that the entire American population is under the left side of the bell curve.
[00:16:25.443 --> 00:16:31.385]  Well, there's no doubt that we've had it too good, too long, and they just have no idea the dark waters are swimming in.
[00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:37.286]  So, Alex, it's part of getting the population ready for the assault on Iran.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:46.384]  This is Israel's... Look, everybody who's knowledgeable and informed knows that Israel has turned down.
[00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:48.164]  It's now on the decline.
[00:16:48.204 --> 00:16:49.785]  The United States is on the decline.
[00:16:49.805 --> 00:16:55.188]  In fact, we're totally dependent now on the Chinese to finance the daily operation of our own government.
[00:16:56.568 --> 00:16:58.049]  So we're both on the decline.
[00:16:58.809 --> 00:17:01.310]  Our power is evaporating before our eyes.
[00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.993]  Israel has twice been defeated by the Hezbollah militia, the famed
[00:17:08.396 --> 00:17:16.378]  And Marble Israeli Army got its ass kicked twice, driven out of Lebanon by a few thousand militia.
[00:17:17.798 --> 00:17:19.018]  The power's on the decline.
[00:17:19.058 --> 00:17:20.799]  This is their last chance.
[00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:25.760]  Bush, assuming he doesn't pull a fast one, will be gone in six months.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.260]  So right now they got their finger on the button.
[00:17:30.581 --> 00:17:37.562]  And they're going to push and push and push and try to get the situation where
[00:17:38.362 --> 00:17:42.609]  Their attack on Iran will be tolerated.
[00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.313]  And so that's what they're using the churches for.
[00:17:46.295 --> 00:17:49.180]  They've got all this out into the churches there.
[00:17:50.014 --> 00:17:51.034]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:17:51.214 --> 00:17:51.814]  I agree with you.
[00:17:51.954 --> 00:17:58.736]  And Ray McGovern, Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, the list is legion, all say that they are going to attack.
[00:17:58.796 --> 00:18:01.036]  Ron Paul says in Congress it's a done deal.
[00:18:01.316 --> 00:18:02.177]  They're going to attack.
[00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:07.178]  If Obama gets elected, they're going to attack right after the election.
[00:18:07.478 --> 00:18:10.138]  If McCain gets elected, it'll be right when he gets in office.
[00:18:10.378 --> 00:18:13.039]  Probably a staged terror attack to bring that in.
[00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:15.399]  Yeah.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.980]  Well, I don't know if they'll get away with it.
[00:18:18.447 --> 00:18:20.649]  But I certainly agree that that's what they want to do.
[00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.233]  Your idea, sir, to stop this, is there any way to stop the total destruction of our country?
[00:18:30.775 --> 00:18:35.218]  Well, I don't think that they're sane.
[00:18:35.719 --> 00:18:39.541]  I don't think that they live in a factual reality.
[00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:47.847]  So, I think that if they want to do it bad enough, they'll fool themselves with
[00:18:48.581 --> 00:18:49.422]  But they can't.
[00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:59.330]  But I think it will leave, it will accelerate the collapse of American power and Israeli power.
[00:19:00.831 --> 00:19:17.465]  And if we think that our invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the Israeli bombings of the civilian Lebanese population and their murders in Gaza and the West Bank have radicalized Muslims, just wait.
[00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:19.460]  Until we nuke Iran.
[00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:25.766]  And then, most likely, all of our puppets will fall in the Middle East.
[00:19:27.528 --> 00:19:29.309]  Israel will probably be exterminated.
[00:19:31.632 --> 00:19:34.254]  Americans won't be able to borrow a dime.
[00:19:35.255 --> 00:19:37.417]  They'll have to close down most of the government.
[00:19:37.457 --> 00:19:38.338]  They can't finance it.
[00:19:38.979 --> 00:19:41.401]  I mean, it can be a catastrophic result.
[00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:44.359]  And Satan laughing will spread his wings.
[00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:46.360]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, stay there.
[00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:47.621]  Amazing analysis.
[00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:49.363]  Come back and hear more from him.
[00:19:49.843 --> 00:19:55.107]  Also, take your phone calls at the bottom of the hour for Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:55.327]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:55.387 --> 00:19:58.149]  His new book is out, The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[00:19:58.189 --> 00:19:59.410]  Get it at bookstores everywhere.
[00:20:00.911 --> 00:20:04.074]  Have you ever felt like the United States government was worried too much about your finances?
[00:20:04.134 --> 00:20:08.798]  Likely all of our puppets will fall in the Middle East.
[00:20:08.918 --> 00:20:10.639]  Israel will probably be exterminated.
[00:20:12.989 --> 00:20:15.051]  Americans won't be able to bar a dime.
[00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:19.574]  They'll have to close down most of the government to pay for the answers.
[00:20:20.335 --> 00:20:22.797]  I mean, it can be a catastrophic result.
[00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:25.879]  And Satan laughing will spread his wings.
[00:20:26.079 --> 00:20:27.840]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, stay there.
[00:20:28.121 --> 00:20:29.081]  Amazing analysis.
[00:20:29.502 --> 00:20:30.803]  Come back and hear more from him.
[00:20:31.283 --> 00:20:36.267]  Also, take your phone calls at the bottom of the hour for Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:20:36.287 --> 00:20:36.787]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:36.827 --> 00:20:39.589]  His new book is out, The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[00:20:39.629 --> 00:20:40.790]  Get it at bookstores everywhere.
[00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:45.922]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:20:46.342 --> 00:20:51.766]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:20:52.227 --> 00:20:53.308]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:20:53.328 --> 00:20:57.371]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:11.342]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:11.842 --> 00:21:17.147]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:17.447 --> 00:21:23.272]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:24.092 --> 00:21:25.874]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:26.934 --> 00:21:30.117]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:30.537 --> 00:21:31.718]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:33.639 --> 00:21:39.303]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[00:21:39.323 --> 00:21:39.683]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:41.965 --> 00:21:43.366]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:45.487]  A new world order.
[00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:50.471]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:51.084 --> 00:21:53.206]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:53.906 --> 00:21:56.028]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:56.688 --> 00:21:59.150]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:07.197]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.182]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:22:15.662 --> 00:22:19.144]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:22:19.544 --> 00:22:22.005]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:22:22.105 --> 00:22:23.246]  Most people have no idea.
[00:22:23.266 --> 00:22:24.046]  They're not after money.
[00:22:24.066 --> 00:22:25.126]  They have all the money they need.
[00:22:25.326 --> 00:22:26.027]  They're after power.
[00:22:26.087 --> 00:22:27.147]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:22:36.931 --> 00:22:38.452]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:22:38.972 --> 00:22:40.173]  You have been warned.
[00:22:42.655 --> 00:22:47.940]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.582]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[00:22:50.942 --> 00:22:54.385]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[00:22:54.605 --> 00:22:57.528]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation.
[00:22:57.708 --> 00:23:05.856]  We can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[00:23:06.017 --> 00:23:09.080]  We offer a real solution using real science.

[00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:28.047]  That's L-A-S-E-M-E-D-I-N-C dot com today.
[00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:57.127]  Imagine if I'd come to you a couple of years ago and said to you, hey, gasoline prices are going to jump to $5 a gallon, and I know a way that we can store several hundred gallons for you, a year or two supply of gasoline, buy it today at $2 a gallon, and when it goes to $5 a gallon, you'll be way ahead of the game.
[00:23:57.447 --> 00:24:01.709]  And you probably at the time would have said to me, you're nuts, get away, you're crazy, go bye-bye!
[00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:07.732]  And okay, fine, now I'm telling you what's happened to gasoline is happening to food, your grocery bills.
[00:24:09.585 --> 00:24:10.887]  We've got to do our duty.
[00:24:10.987 --> 00:24:12.148]  Consequence belongs to God.
[00:24:12.209 --> 00:24:14.412]  We've got to try to warn people what this war is going to mean.
[00:24:14.432 --> 00:24:17.295]  The economy to our name.
[00:24:18.905 --> 00:24:19.025]  Well,
[00:24:48.132 --> 00:24:50.093]  It not only looks like it, it's a fact.
[00:24:52.855 --> 00:24:55.296]  You won't get any argument out of me on that score, Alex.
[00:24:58.758 --> 00:25:04.561]  I think that's another important sign of just the disconnect from reality we're seeing in the power structure, Dr. Roberts.
[00:25:06.763 --> 00:25:10.505]  Well, don't you know they bragged on how disconnected they were?
[00:25:12.846 --> 00:25:16.128]  They would create the reality and we'd have to go find out what it was.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.681]  So they don't accept any limits.
[00:25:21.642 --> 00:25:24.323]  They think they're omnipotent.
[00:25:25.884 --> 00:25:30.405]  And it's so hilarious, because these are the guys that can't occupy Baghdad.
[00:25:31.266 --> 00:25:45.732]  These are the guys that have to allow the Chinese to pay their salaries, and lend us money to pay Social Security wealth, and lend us money to buy fuel for the planes we use to bomb
[00:25:46.587 --> 00:25:50.109]  Civilians in the Middle East and Africa and wherever.
[00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.052]  And yet they think they're omnipotent.
[00:25:55.073 --> 00:25:57.394]  We already decided, didn't we, that they were insane.
[00:25:59.075 --> 00:26:03.218]  So, of course, that means they're a huge danger to us.
[00:26:03.238 --> 00:26:06.120]  I don't think people, short of taking up arms,
[00:26:14.918 --> 00:26:18.840]  During what Thomas Jefferson said that we needed to do every 200 years.
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.121]  And of course, he lived in a time of very slow change.
[00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:27.464]  So 200 years, he would probably shorten that if he was around today.
[00:26:28.624 --> 00:26:34.407]  Other than, you know, overthrowing the government, starting over, there's nothing we can do because they don't listen to us.
[00:26:34.967 --> 00:26:36.948]  The people don't count.
[00:26:37.008 --> 00:26:39.709]  Bush has made it clear there's no interest in public opinion.
[00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:42.828]  The Democrats aren't either.
[00:26:42.848 --> 00:26:53.292]  I mean, the electorate tried to stop it when we elected the Democrats in 2006, and the Democrats did nothing.
[00:26:53.913 --> 00:26:54.913]  They've not used the power.
[00:26:55.173 --> 00:26:58.195]  Why do you think Conyers and Pelosi are blocking any impeachment?
[00:26:58.255 --> 00:26:58.535]  Fear?
[00:26:59.895 --> 00:27:01.016]  Paid off money.
[00:27:01.876 --> 00:27:02.536]  They've been bought.
[00:27:04.137 --> 00:27:08.259]  Somebody's put, you know, 10, 20, 30 million dollars on the account somewhere for them.
[00:27:09.352 --> 00:27:10.592]  That's my view of it.
[00:27:10.812 --> 00:27:11.913]  I mean, I can't prove that.
[00:27:11.973 --> 00:27:12.813]  Nobody can prove it.
[00:27:14.193 --> 00:27:15.254]  I think they're all balls.
[00:27:15.294 --> 00:27:16.954]  They're not any sincere people.
[00:27:17.434 --> 00:27:19.715]  Who do we know that's sincere in politics?
[00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:21.956]  Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich.
[00:27:22.256 --> 00:27:24.196]  And Ron Paul almost died a few days ago.
[00:27:24.216 --> 00:27:25.216]  I'm sure you heard about that.
[00:27:25.817 --> 00:27:26.357]  No, I didn't.
[00:27:26.697 --> 00:27:29.158]  The depressurization and nosedive of the aircraft?
[00:27:29.958 --> 00:27:30.858]  No, I didn't know about that.
[00:27:30.878 --> 00:27:32.218]  With seven congressmen on board?
[00:27:32.238 --> 00:27:35.739]  Well, maybe that was a warning.
[00:27:38.806 --> 00:27:40.907]  Listen, I don't want to get too conspiratorial.
[00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:46.569]  And I don't want to get people too, you know, down and give up.
[00:27:46.629 --> 00:27:49.630]  But I think we've reached the point now where it's out of our hands.
[00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:55.732]  The question really is how the rising powers view this.
[00:27:55.752 --> 00:27:59.613]  The rising powers are China, Russia, India.
[00:28:01.734 --> 00:28:03.514]  In 20 years, they'll rule the world.
[00:28:03.574 --> 00:28:04.295]  We'll be nothing.
[00:28:05.335 --> 00:28:08.276]  And the question is how will they view this?
[00:28:10.575 --> 00:28:15.216]  Do the Russians want radioactivity on their borders?
[00:28:15.776 --> 00:28:21.438]  Do the Chinese want all their energy investments destroyed in Iran?
[00:28:24.038 --> 00:28:31.760]  Do the Europeans want this with their large Muslim populations who will probably be radicalized by it?
[00:28:34.371 --> 00:28:41.237]  And whether or not any of them do anything, and whether they all say, well, look, let's just let the fools go ahead, because this is the best way to get rid of America.
[00:28:41.557 --> 00:28:43.038]  Well, that's what the Russians are saying.
[00:28:43.058 --> 00:28:44.399]  They're saying, go ahead, fools.
[00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:59.211]  Yeah, I think maybe that's... I think that's what the Chinese decided, that rather than interfere and get in a conflict with us that might re-energize us in some other way,
[00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:02.601]  They'll just let us go on dry doom.
[00:29:02.621 --> 00:29:05.243]  You know, nobody tried to stop Hitler from marching into Germany.
[00:29:07.204 --> 00:29:10.407]  When he did that, the British Churchill said, well, now we've won.
[00:29:11.988 --> 00:29:22.276]  So, I don't think anybody will stop us in order to save the Iranians, because they haven't got anything against the Iranians, but they've got a lot against us.
[00:29:22.597 --> 00:29:25.599]  And if we self-destruct, it's easier.
[00:29:26.523 --> 00:29:27.804]  Yeah, they don't like us anyhow.
[00:29:27.824 --> 00:29:34.788]  I mean, we're always bossing people around, criticizing them for sins that are a fraction of our own sins.
[00:29:34.808 --> 00:29:36.289]  Dr. Roberts, stay there.
[00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.371]  Okay, stay there with us.
[00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:45.754]  We're gonna come right back and finish up how you see this unfolding and taking phone calls.
[00:29:45.835 --> 00:29:46.555]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.577 --> 00:29:51.418]  We're on the Valley 1.
[00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:54.940]  So, I don't think anybody
[00:29:56.144 --> 00:30:03.669]  We'll stop us in order to save the Iranians, because they haven't got anything against the Iranians, but they got a lot against us.
[00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:08.093]  And if we self-destruct, it's easier for them.
[00:30:08.113 --> 00:30:09.173]  They don't like us anyhow.
[00:30:09.193 --> 00:30:16.199]  I mean, we're always bossing people around, criticizing them for sins that are a fraction of our own sins.
[00:30:16.219 --> 00:30:17.700]  Dr. Roberts, stay there.
[00:30:19.261 --> 00:30:20.802]  Okay, stay there with us.
[00:30:20.822 --> 00:30:24.885]  We're gonna come right back and finish up how you see this unfolding.
[00:30:25.743 --> 00:30:27.964]  And, uh, taking phone calls, stay with us.
[00:30:31.926 --> 00:30:32.867]  We're on the march.
[00:30:33.327 --> 00:30:34.948]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:38.670]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:44.733 --> 00:30:47.654]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[00:30:48.115 --> 00:30:52.237]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[00:30:52.957 --> 00:30:54.618]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[00:30:55.433 --> 00:30:59.540]  Tebowtech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[00:31:44.551 --> 00:31:46.672]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[00:31:46.893 --> 00:31:51.796]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:54.457]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[00:31:54.677 --> 00:31:58.800]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.842]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[00:32:02.002 --> 00:32:05.244]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[00:32:05.344 --> 00:32:10.207]  Food riots and breadlines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[00:32:10.407 --> 00:32:14.349]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[00:32:14.469 --> 00:32:19.311]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.
[00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:21.052]  We have tons of food in stock now.

[00:32:33.757 --> 00:32:37.459]  And remember, those without food will be servants of those with the food.
[00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:38.179]  Call now.
[00:32:41.698 --> 00:32:43.720]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:32:43.841 --> 00:32:46.263]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:32:46.283 --> 00:32:48.906]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:32:48.926 --> 00:32:50.068]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:32:50.088 --> 00:32:51.689]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:54.653]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:32:54.693 --> 00:32:58.477]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:32:58.717 --> 00:33:00.359]  Are you listening?
[00:33:00.419 --> 00:33:00.860]  Shut up!
[00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:11.075]  David, George, Steve, Todd, Mike, and many others are going to be on your phone calls here in about five minutes.
[00:33:11.776 --> 00:33:15.280]  I wanted to first get, Dr. Roberts is an expert on the economy.
[00:33:16.832 --> 00:33:19.074]  He was the engineer of one of the biggest boom times in U.S.
[00:33:19.094 --> 00:33:21.275]  history during the 80s and the early 90s.
[00:33:22.116 --> 00:33:25.699]  And of course, he added up the Department of the Treasury policy.
[00:33:25.739 --> 00:33:26.800]  He called the shots there.
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.382]  Really honored that he spent so much time with us and we appreciate that.
[00:33:30.763 --> 00:33:38.889]  Your call is coming up in a moment after I ask him where he thinks the economy is currently with these bank runs and commodities and the rest of it.
[00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:39.710]  Before we do that,
[00:33:40.714 --> 00:33:44.555]  Two sponsors that make this radio show possible are really fabulous folks.
[00:33:45.175 --> 00:33:46.756]  One of them is Acola Blue.
[00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:48.296]  Acolablue.com.
[00:33:48.336 --> 00:33:50.637]  Big fat banner up on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:52.598 --> 00:33:56.459]  If you forget the web address, it's E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com.
[00:33:56.519 --> 00:34:00.980]  Acolablue.com or 1-866-585-4044.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:01.500]  What is it?
[00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:04.201]  I saw one of these a decade ago.
[00:34:04.321 --> 00:34:06.102]  It's put out by Hendrix.
[00:34:07.002 --> 00:34:09.483]  It's just an amazing system that gets
[00:34:11.038 --> 00:34:14.061]  As much as 7.5 gallons a day in humid areas.
[00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:16.122]  In desert it gets about 2 gallons a day.
[00:34:16.142 --> 00:34:17.984]  It grabs it out of the atmosphere.
[00:34:18.044 --> 00:34:19.665]  Then it puts it through 5 filters.
[00:34:20.586 --> 00:34:25.891]  Okay, and very easy to maintenance and you can plug it into a solar panel if you want or use power to do it.
[00:34:27.014 --> 00:34:35.539]  An amazing system, acolablue.com, 1-866-585-4844, or check out the website, acolablue.com.
[00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:38.121]  Also another sponsor, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:34:38.141 --> 00:34:41.543]  Look, I don't know what's going to happen, but if there's a 10% chance we're going to have a depression,
[00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:43.524]  Or World War III.
[00:34:44.104 --> 00:34:45.746]  It's a lot worse than that, obviously.
[00:34:46.106 --> 00:34:47.987]  We can only hope to collapse like the Soviet Union.
[00:34:48.007 --> 00:34:49.208]  That's what all the experts are saying.
[00:34:49.248 --> 00:34:55.033]  Instead of just going on in a Hitlerian event of endless war and national drafts and total martial law.
[00:34:55.413 --> 00:34:56.474]  You need to have storable food.
[00:34:56.494 --> 00:34:57.675]  They'll use food as a weapon.
[00:34:57.715 --> 00:34:58.656]  It's in the cards.
[00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.317]  You need to have storable food.
[00:35:00.377 --> 00:35:02.679]  High quality, freeze-dried food.
[00:35:02.699 --> 00:35:03.680]  They got it in stock.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.582]  It's where I've gotten storable foods four times and bought it for family.
[00:35:07.102 --> 00:35:07.823]  Wonderful people.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.581]  eFoodsDirect.com, eFoodsDirect.com is the website.
[00:35:12.601 --> 00:35:17.983]  Huge banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or give them a call, get a free brochure, a free audio CD.
[00:35:18.663 --> 00:35:21.985]  About their product line is the J. Michael Stevens Group, 800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:35:28.587 --> 00:35:36.592]  And before we go back to Dr. Roberts, I do want to then also remind everybody that Dr. Roberts has a best-selling book now in its second edition, The Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[00:35:36.732 --> 00:35:41.535]  You need to get it to see how they're setting up a total police state here in the United States.
[00:35:41.655 --> 00:35:42.696]  It's in bookstores everywhere.
[00:35:42.716 --> 00:35:45.458]  In fact, I was at the bookstore about a month ago and saw a stack of them sitting there.
[00:35:45.858 --> 00:35:46.918]  So be sure and get that.
[00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:51.721]  Even if you know all about this stuff, get it and give it to somebody that reads in your family who's not fully awakened.
[00:35:52.082 --> 00:35:55.324]  Because that's the only way to stop this is educating people one step at a time.
[00:35:56.785 --> 00:36:01.089]  Dr. Roberts, briefly, because I want to go to calls while we have you for people who want to talk to you.
[00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:07.875]  The economy, give us a rundown with your expertise on the current state of affairs and where you see it going.
[00:36:08.956 --> 00:36:12.259]  Okay, Alex, you know, the situation is different than ever before.
[00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:14.481]  These financial instruments are different.
[00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:17.704]  The risks that people have taken are much greater.
[00:36:19.005 --> 00:36:21.367]  The damage is far more widespread.
[00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:30.172]  Most likely outcome, in my opinion, we're going to have an inflationary recession.
[00:36:30.192 --> 00:36:32.672]  A serious recession.
[00:36:33.533 --> 00:36:37.554]  Inflationary, not deflationary.
[00:36:37.794 --> 00:36:47.156]  Because the Federal Reserve is going to supply the liquidity to make whole all of these bad investments.
[00:36:48.396 --> 00:36:51.617]  And therefore, there's going to be an outpouring of money.
[00:36:52.537 --> 00:36:56.519]  But it's going to have literally no effect in raising employment.
[00:36:57.179 --> 00:36:59.640]  So we're going to have high inflation, high unemployment.
[00:37:00.061 --> 00:37:11.506]  It's going to be a very difficult situation to get out of because the policy levers just don't exist to deal with that kind of catastrophe.
[00:37:12.127 --> 00:37:21.211]  It's amazing that the government of the United States was capable of producing such an unholy mess.
[00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:22.586]  Well, you think.
[00:37:22.706 --> 00:37:27.108]  It wasn't that long ago that we had a very strong economy.
[00:37:27.688 --> 00:37:29.648]  Reagan gave us back the economy.
[00:37:29.688 --> 00:37:33.230]  We were growing without rising inflation.
[00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:34.970]  Everything was fine.
[00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:36.671]  It was just completely wrecked.
[00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:48.354]  And they've now got a situation, as I said, that I think will be an inflationary recession that they will have no way to get out of.
[00:37:48.374 --> 00:37:48.414]  So,
[00:37:52.173 --> 00:37:53.214]  It's not good.
[00:37:53.734 --> 00:37:55.636]  Nothing good.
[00:37:55.716 --> 00:37:57.177]  There's no leadership.
[00:37:57.257 --> 00:37:59.079]  There's no awareness.
[00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:01.280]  They're full of hubris.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.342]  They still think they're a superpower.
[00:38:05.504 --> 00:38:06.184]  What can you do?
[00:38:07.245 --> 00:38:09.707]  Isn't that, historically, the worst combination?
[00:38:10.068 --> 00:38:15.992]  To have a retracting, contracting economy while you have inflation going into hyperinflation?
[00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:18.915]  Or is there any other... Oh, so it is the worst?
[00:38:19.693 --> 00:38:20.634]  That is the worst.
[00:38:20.974 --> 00:38:21.955]  You nailed it, Alex.
[00:38:21.995 --> 00:38:22.495]  You nailed it.
[00:38:22.595 --> 00:38:29.801]  That is the worst situation, and there's no obvious remedy.
[00:38:30.201 --> 00:38:40.149]  In fact, the remedy is so serious, difficult, and imposes such cost that people shy away from it.
[00:38:41.169 --> 00:38:41.889]  Well, isn't that it?
[00:38:41.929 --> 00:38:49.671]  We have an infantile public that can't deal with interest rate hikes, or with tariffs, or with other things, or with investment in manufacturing.
[00:38:49.711 --> 00:38:50.932]  They want things that are instant.
[00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:58.514]  And so instead, they're going to give us kind of the morphine, putting us into a coma, and then economic death, collapse?
[00:38:59.914 --> 00:39:03.615]  Yeah, I think people are not going to be able to afford anything.
[00:39:03.636 --> 00:39:04.736]  They're not going to have income.
[00:39:04.756 --> 00:39:06.816]  The government is going to pay its bills by printing money.
[00:39:10.587 --> 00:39:15.331]  This great unipower will disappear off the face of the earth really quick.
[00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:18.053]  People have no idea how vulnerable we are.
[00:39:18.633 --> 00:39:29.301]  You know, the United States trade deficit is larger than the combined trade deficits of every other country in the world that's in deficit position.
[00:39:32.443 --> 00:39:33.284]  This is extraordinary.
[00:39:33.344 --> 00:39:38.788]  Our budget deficit is larger than the annual budget deficit of the government.
[00:39:39.656 --> 00:39:42.437]  Then the combined budget debits of every other country in the world.
[00:39:42.557 --> 00:39:43.597]  Okay, let me ask you this question.
[00:39:44.538 --> 00:39:47.699]  Alex, we finance these by foreigners lending us the money.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:55.182]  And then there's no industry to have the money to buy goods anymore, so it's going to cause a worldwide problem, isn't it?
[00:39:55.202 --> 00:39:56.102]  We've got nothing to sell.
[00:39:56.322 --> 00:39:59.063]  We've got nothing to sell to close the trade debt.
[00:39:59.143 --> 00:40:06.066]  And now that they've run up the oil price so much, the trade debit must be somewhere over a trillion dollars.
[00:40:08.078 --> 00:40:13.681]  I mean, it was seven, eight hundred billion back when the oil price was, what, thirty dollars?
[00:40:15.261 --> 00:40:16.582]  Let me ask you this.
[00:40:18.563 --> 00:40:22.485]  It's got to be, the trade deficit must be somewhere around a trillion dollars.
[00:40:23.445 --> 00:40:28.207]  And the only way we pay for that is by turning over the ownership of our existing assets.
[00:40:28.748 --> 00:40:29.568]  And that's happening now?
[00:40:30.328 --> 00:40:31.109]  That's been happening.
[00:40:31.149 --> 00:40:35.811]  So now we're going to start giving them, instead of giving them seven, eight hundred billion dollars a year of what we have,
[00:40:36.713 --> 00:40:37.754]  A trillion dollars.
[00:40:37.814 --> 00:40:51.925]  That's our companies, you know, all the natural resources, we're selling the toll roads to them, so they get the revenues from toll roads, the real estate, anything we can offer them.
[00:40:52.185 --> 00:40:53.726]  How long until all that runs out?
[00:40:56.408 --> 00:40:57.629]  It wouldn't last very long.
[00:40:57.649 --> 00:41:00.611]  A trillion dollars a year runs through wealth pretty fast.
[00:41:02.032 --> 00:41:04.314]  Even for a country that's, you know,
[00:41:05.012 --> 00:41:07.013]  It's been successful and accumulated.
[00:41:07.113 --> 00:41:09.455]  So this brings a new meaning to the word, looted.
[00:41:09.475 --> 00:41:12.256]  Looted, yeah.
[00:41:13.357 --> 00:41:19.380]  We thought we were so smart, we were looting the world, getting all their goods, getting them to finance us and handing them paper.
[00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:22.582]  But the paper comes back and buys up our assets.
[00:41:23.863 --> 00:41:29.226]  The only question is, will the paper collapse completely before they can buy it all up?
[00:41:29.266 --> 00:41:30.167]  In a way that might be good.
[00:41:30.827 --> 00:41:32.068]  Last question, we're going to go to calls.
[00:41:33.354 --> 00:41:42.636]  They are announcing, and it's in the housing bill, and I've got the bill right here, we had Ron Paul on about it today, that every credit card transaction will instantly be uploaded to the IRS.
[00:41:43.056 --> 00:41:50.478]  Major gas companies, ABC News reports, are going to make you register with a credit card to be able to buy gas, to track everything you're doing.
[00:41:50.898 --> 00:41:53.579]  They're hiring more police, more checkpoints, more tickets.
[00:41:55.939 --> 00:41:58.021]  Newborn baby will be visited by CPS.
[00:41:58.121 --> 00:41:59.422]  That bill is about to pass.
[00:42:00.343 --> 00:42:02.445]  Turning carbon taxes, harassment.
[00:42:02.805 --> 00:42:05.407]  Government is just, as you know, tripled in the last eight years.
[00:42:05.828 --> 00:42:10.512]  It just seems to be about to divide again and get even bigger like a bacterial infection.
[00:42:11.172 --> 00:42:12.673]  They'll all have badges.
[00:42:43.534 --> 00:42:48.196]  You know, there's no reason for any of this to happen, and we certainly don't have any money to pay for it.
[00:42:49.417 --> 00:42:52.018]  And the Chinese aren't going to keep lending them all this money.
[00:42:52.538 --> 00:42:53.499]  You know, I just don't know.
[00:42:53.519 --> 00:42:57.680]  If it's really going to be something like that, I think people should just leave the country.
[00:43:00.082 --> 00:43:01.102]  They should just get out.
[00:43:01.262 --> 00:43:02.403]  Well, that's what your book is about.
[00:43:02.463 --> 00:43:03.443]  I mean, what is it now?
[00:43:04.343 --> 00:43:05.824]  I mean, what are they making?
[00:43:05.884 --> 00:43:07.085]  I mean, that's what they're setting up.
[00:43:08.445 --> 00:43:09.846]  Well, what is the point of this?
[00:43:10.959 --> 00:43:22.549]  uh... credit card business and and all of them purchases going to the government and investing every child is born by child protect what is the point of all this?
[00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:25.231]  I mean, what purpose does that serve?
[00:43:25.551 --> 00:43:26.412]  Total control!
[00:43:27.613 --> 00:43:29.094]  Just to intimidate people, huh?
[00:43:29.795 --> 00:43:35.940]  Well then, then what they'll do is they'll alienate everyone from the government.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.721]  I don't know if that's good for them or not.
[00:43:37.841 --> 00:43:38.782]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:43:38.862 --> 00:43:39.563]  It's like
[00:43:41.448 --> 00:43:43.330]  Well, I've got an ABC News report.
[00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.611]  We don't have time to play it today.
[00:43:44.951 --> 00:43:45.632]  You know what, John?
[00:43:45.672 --> 00:43:46.553]  Cue it up to the part.
[00:43:47.153 --> 00:43:48.274]  This is ABC News.
[00:43:48.395 --> 00:43:50.517]  I just want to play like 30 seconds of this before you leave us.
[00:43:51.357 --> 00:43:52.178]  After we take some calls.
[00:43:52.639 --> 00:43:54.300]  You know the one I sent you about the airport screeners?
[00:43:54.801 --> 00:43:59.785]  And it talks about, you know, a World War II vet with a metal knee.
[00:44:01.127 --> 00:44:04.009]  And they pulled his pants down in front of everybody.
[00:44:04.029 --> 00:44:04.970]  Oh, I saw that.
[00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.531]  I sent you that.
[00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:08.692]  Oh great, well that's why it's on our website, thank you.
[00:44:08.792 --> 00:44:11.612]  And then they start beating their chest going, I HAVE POWER!
[00:44:12.092 --> 00:44:13.113]  I HAVE POWER!
[00:44:13.513 --> 00:44:19.354]  And then like just grabbing young women's breasts and just, and like a woman asks a question so they just punch her and knock her over.
[00:44:19.374 --> 00:44:21.755]  I mean, and I had that happen to me at LAX.
[00:44:21.775 --> 00:44:25.916]  They started making fun of me and saying my feet stunk and I just had a shower, they were new shoes, they didn't.
[00:44:26.216 --> 00:44:28.557]  And these guys are standing over me saying, you got a problem?
[00:44:28.577 --> 00:44:29.457]  You want to make a move?
[00:44:29.857 --> 00:44:31.857]  I mean this is, you want to comment on that?
[00:44:31.937 --> 00:44:33.038]  I HAVE POWER!
[00:44:33.218 --> 00:44:33.978]  I HAVE POWER!
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.523]  Well, I recently wrote a column, I think, about the airport, the stopover.
[00:44:38.543 --> 00:44:40.004]  I think it's about two columns back.
[00:44:41.225 --> 00:44:45.468]  And if you have any callers waiting, we should take them.
[00:44:45.548 --> 00:44:46.949]  And if you don't, we'll keep talking.
[00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:50.151]  Oh no, we have loaded phones, but I want to get your take on the I have power comment.
[00:44:53.354 --> 00:45:02.380]  Well, those kinds of occupations, police, airport security, any of that stuff, attract sociopaths.
[00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:03.761]  Peon sociopaths.
[00:45:05.336 --> 00:45:06.596]  They don't attract good people.
[00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:16.399]  They attract people that want to abuse people, but they ain't got enough guts to go join the Marines and actually have to go somewhere and get shot back at.
[00:45:16.519 --> 00:45:21.280]  So they like to have power where their victims are powerless.
[00:45:22.841 --> 00:45:23.821]  So they're cowards.
[00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:24.701]  They know it.
[00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:26.902]  All bullies are cowards.
[00:45:28.722 --> 00:45:31.843]  And so it's this massive bureaucracy that protects them.
[00:45:34.542 --> 00:45:37.824]  So that's the kind of people that take those jobs.
[00:45:37.864 --> 00:45:45.928]  When you create those kinds of jobs, you're creating homes, places, employment for those kinds of people.
[00:45:46.408 --> 00:45:47.829]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:48.929]  John, do you have that queued up yet?
[00:45:48.989 --> 00:45:49.950]  I have the power comment.
[00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:52.131]  I'm trying to find it.
[00:45:52.311 --> 00:45:53.792]  Okay, great.
[00:45:53.812 --> 00:45:54.552]  We'll play in a few minutes.
[00:45:54.572 --> 00:45:55.133]  Let's go to calls.
[00:45:55.153 --> 00:45:56.233]  We're going to skip this break, too.
[00:45:56.593 --> 00:45:59.055]  David in Florida, you're on the air with Dr. Paul Greg Roberts.
[00:45:59.075 --> 00:45:59.595]  Thanks for holding.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.040]  How are you doing?
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:01.641]  Good.
[00:46:01.661 --> 00:46:03.041]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:04.782]  I'm really thankful for what you do.
[00:46:04.842 --> 00:46:05.962]  I mean, you don't even know.
[00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:18.106]  I'm calling because I heard, I just checked out this guy named Jeff Rents last night, and he had a guy named Benjamin Fulford, and he's some big-wig Forbes guy or something.
[00:46:18.126 --> 00:46:21.727]  Yeah, talking about how the Asian elites are sick of the New World Order and done with us.
[00:46:22.467 --> 00:46:24.628]  Yeah, and like they have a hit on...
[00:46:25.553 --> 00:46:28.575]  They're ready to die on August 8th if they don't calm down.
[00:46:28.615 --> 00:46:38.441]  Yeah, I don't know about that, but Fulford did write for Forbes and he says that the Asian Mafia, which is basically the heads of the Chinese and Japanese governments, are threatening the New World Order.
[00:46:39.562 --> 00:46:40.423]  I appreciate your call.
[00:46:40.803 --> 00:46:47.707]  That's speculative, so we don't go there, but Dr. Roberts, we know in reality the Chinese and others are saying that they're dumb of all this.
[00:46:49.788 --> 00:46:52.090]  Yeah, I think they're dumb of all this, but they're the rising powers.
[00:46:53.106 --> 00:46:55.308]  Yeah, they don't need to act like a bunch.
[00:46:55.328 --> 00:46:56.589]  It'll happen in our lifetime.
[00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.371]  George in Indiana, you're on the air with Dr. Roberts.
[00:46:59.411 --> 00:46:59.792]  Go ahead.
[00:47:02.094 --> 00:47:03.375]  Thanks, Dr. Roberts.
[00:47:03.535 --> 00:47:04.756]  You and Alex are doing a great job.
[00:47:04.816 --> 00:47:08.339]  I've got two or three comments, and real quick ones that I have a question for you.
[00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:08.900]  Go, go, go.
[00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:16.727]  I went to Burger King yesterday to get me a fish sandwich, and on the drive-thru window, now it says no video filming or picture taking.
[00:47:17.027 --> 00:47:20.310]  I'm going to go in there and tell that manager I'm never eating there again until that comes down.
[00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:21.291]  Well, I want to explain.
[00:47:21.351 --> 00:47:24.814]  They're going to surveil us, but then we can't surveil them back.
[00:47:24.854 --> 00:47:29.778]  And I've got tons of videos of cops walking up on city streets telling people don't take camp shots.
[00:47:29.998 --> 00:47:31.880]  Again, it's just more martial law.
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.640]  What's the other comment?
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:33.521]  Absolutely.
[00:47:34.362 --> 00:47:37.104]  On this guy that thinks he follows the Christian attitude,
[00:47:37.484 --> 00:47:41.207]  The second commandment says, make no image of heaven or earth or bound down to it.
[00:47:41.247 --> 00:47:42.528]  You see crosses everywhere.
[00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:44.730]  These people don't understand what they're worshiping.
[00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.113]  In Florida, there's a guy that says he is Jesus and the Antichrist.
[00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:50.675]  Putting 666 on people and they're following him around.
[00:47:50.735 --> 00:47:52.576]  Do you have any questions for Dr. Roberts?
[00:47:52.596 --> 00:47:53.877]  Because that's why we open the phones up.
[00:47:55.759 --> 00:47:56.500]  Another thing.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.982]  Our government is not a department of offense.
[00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:01.303]  It's a department of defense.
[00:48:01.584 --> 00:48:04.326]  We shouldn't be attacking people with no provocation.
[00:48:04.626 --> 00:48:06.548]  What I want to ask you guys though is
[00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:15.413]  Explain to everybody out there what it means when it says that those are with Israel, God is with them, those are against Israel, God is against them.
[00:48:15.453 --> 00:48:16.634]  Explain what that really means.
[00:48:16.854 --> 00:48:18.194]  Well, I mean, it's not in the Bible.
[00:48:18.594 --> 00:48:21.875]  The prophets were coming and saying when Israel was bad and was going to go into exile.
[00:48:21.936 --> 00:48:25.757]  It's just made up, and it makes the Christian religion now Israel worship.
[00:48:25.797 --> 00:48:26.377]  Dr. Roberts?
[00:48:26.397 --> 00:48:28.378]  Well, I think you nailed it.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:32.180]  I mean, I agree with you, Alex.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.781]  It's just mindless cult worship.
[00:48:33.841 --> 00:48:35.301]  I mean, it's insane.
[00:48:36.061 --> 00:48:41.403]  And Israel doesn't like the Christian faith in the government, so they have Hagee say Jesus is not Jesus.
[00:48:41.443 --> 00:48:43.044]  I mean, and they say, alright, he's bad.
[00:48:43.664 --> 00:48:45.684]  I mean, you know, these people will do anything they're told, folks.
[00:48:46.185 --> 00:48:50.846]  I mean, Hagee could dress up in a devil outfit and say, you know, have Anton LaVey in, and they'd bow down.
[00:48:51.886 --> 00:48:52.386]  Who's up next?
[00:48:52.406 --> 00:48:53.287]  George or Steve here?
[00:48:54.907 --> 00:48:56.008]  Steve in Ohio.
[00:48:56.048 --> 00:48:56.568]  You're on the air.
[00:48:56.588 --> 00:48:57.528]  Go ahead with Dr. Roberts.
[00:48:57.568 --> 00:48:58.608]  Any economic questions?
[00:48:59.029 --> 00:48:59.789]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:48:59.869 --> 00:49:00.369]  Mr. Roberts?
[00:49:02.115 --> 00:49:02.775]  I got a question.
[00:49:02.795 --> 00:49:06.298]  Did any of you guys see that speech by George Bush that he addressed?
[00:49:06.378 --> 00:49:14.343]  He was actually addressing the nation and he more or less informed us that our country wasn't going to be the industrial power that it used to be.
[00:49:16.305 --> 00:49:21.128]  We're moving toward data processing and service-oriented industries.
[00:49:21.889 --> 00:49:23.210]  You guys remember seeing that?
[00:49:23.942 --> 00:49:24.162]  Yes.
[00:49:24.943 --> 00:49:25.963]  That's what we see now, right?
[00:49:26.203 --> 00:49:31.946]  We see the destruction of manufacturing and all these large corporations in this country disappear.
[00:49:32.126 --> 00:49:33.427]  It didn't happen by accident.
[00:49:33.447 --> 00:49:39.350]  Dr. Roberts, you know, thinks that they just are a bunch of idiots, and I agree they are delusional, but they're engineering this.
[00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:41.451]  I mean, they know what they're doing, don't they, Dr. Roberts?
[00:49:42.872 --> 00:49:45.954]  It's not just manufacturing jobs, either.
[00:49:46.434 --> 00:49:50.096]  It's all the data processing jobs, all the computer software jobs.
[00:49:51.217 --> 00:49:51.757]  It's any
[00:49:52.581 --> 00:50:01.945]  A job that's tradable, that is, that doesn't have to be done hands-on, like a barber or a dentist or awaiting a table or fixing a drink.
[00:50:02.205 --> 00:50:05.026]  You don't make a living at that job.
[00:50:05.066 --> 00:50:18.671]  The reason they're doing it is because it dramatically lowers their cost of production and they then can pay themselves a multi-million dollar
[00:50:22.134 --> 00:50:26.816]  It's a short-term thing for them, but does destroy the goose that lays the golden eggs.
[00:50:27.516 --> 00:50:30.197]  What happens when China calls in their loans?
[00:50:30.217 --> 00:50:32.558]  What happens when they stop taking American dollars?
[00:50:34.979 --> 00:50:37.820]  The government can't pay its bills any longer.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:38.300]  The U.S.
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:43.842]  government can't pay its bills if the Chinese don't buy its paper.
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:48.862]  And that's why they're setting up work brigades and the million-man youth corps.
[00:50:48.882 --> 00:50:55.605]  Did you see Obama, Dr. Roberts, say that he wants a million-man teenagers spying on the American people last week?
[00:50:56.506 --> 00:50:57.406]  I didn't see that.
[00:50:58.067 --> 00:51:00.288]  Well, then he's just now part of the problem.
[00:51:01.388 --> 00:51:01.729]  Isn't he?
[00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:03.329]  I mean, all this stuff about change.
[00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.411]  It sounds like the only change he's going to bring is for the worse.
[00:51:08.512 --> 00:51:11.814]  Well, now he's out talking the line of warmongering.
[00:51:11.894 --> 00:51:13.915]  I mean, we know he's handled by the same crew.
[00:51:15.626 --> 00:51:16.046]  That's right.
[00:51:17.447 --> 00:51:18.307]  I totally agree.
[00:51:18.367 --> 00:51:19.207]  It's the same crew.
[00:51:20.147 --> 00:51:27.909]  And what we mustn't overlook, though, is the United States is no longer the powerhouse that they think it is.
[00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:41.453]  Well, like you said, this isn't like a man who beats his wife every night with a tire iron, and she's finally leaving, and he really tries to intimidate her when she's got everything loaded up, and he pulls a gun out and threatens to shoot her.
[00:51:41.773 --> 00:51:43.054]  I mean, I think we've gotten to that point.
[00:51:43.074 --> 00:51:44.034]  Would you agree with that analogy?
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.383]  Well, if we pull a gun on China or Russia, we're going to get our clocks clean.
[00:51:51.245 --> 00:51:53.767]  So, of course, that's what McCain wants to do.
[00:51:54.247 --> 00:51:54.668]  Apparently.
[00:51:55.588 --> 00:51:56.689]  And that's what the Neocons do.
[00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:59.011]  McCain has the body language of a lunatic.
[00:51:59.051 --> 00:51:59.832]  Would you agree with that?
[00:51:59.852 --> 00:52:04.056]  I mean, he acts like... I mean, if I knew that guy in business, I would think he had a screw loose.
[00:52:04.356 --> 00:52:06.778]  I think they call it testosterone poisoning.
[00:52:08.099 --> 00:52:12.102]  I think that's the psychological term for McCain.
[00:52:12.383 --> 00:52:14.024]  Testosterone poisoning.
[00:52:18.703 --> 00:52:20.124]  Yeah, he's definitely got to screw loose.
[00:52:20.144 --> 00:52:21.364]  Thank you, Steve.
[00:52:21.464 --> 00:52:23.645]  Todd in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:52:27.366 --> 00:52:27.987]  Go ahead, Todd.
[00:52:28.587 --> 00:52:29.267]  Hey, how's it going?
[00:52:29.707 --> 00:52:44.593]  I just wanted to call in and make the point, it's funny how the people that are saying that you should follow the government and do whatever they say, they say follow those laws, are the same ones that actually reject the laws of God, but they say you've got to follow man's laws, but don't follow God's laws.
[00:52:45.456 --> 00:52:46.297]  Does that make any sense?
[00:52:46.397 --> 00:52:46.937]  No, no, that's right.
[00:52:46.957 --> 00:52:51.681]  They're the funny Christians that go out and have abortions and get, you know, get divorced five or six times.
[00:52:51.721 --> 00:52:52.862]  And I'm not even judging those people.
[00:52:52.882 --> 00:52:57.566]  The point is, they're the ones that do that, and they're the ones that'll steal from you in business.
[00:52:57.606 --> 00:53:00.289]  I mean, I grew up around a bunch of big Dallas preachers in the neighborhood I lived in.
[00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:01.650]  You know, upper middle class.
[00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:02.110]  My dad.
[00:53:03.171 --> 00:53:11.478]  And I saw him partying, and I saw him with the hookers next door, and I saw him with all the... And I'd see him on TV the next, you know, the next day on Sunday on Dallas television.
[00:53:11.498 --> 00:53:12.479]  Dr. Roberts, you're giggling.
[00:53:16.305 --> 00:53:25.667]  Well, listen, I think on the whole, the question is open whether or not there is a Christian religion.
[00:53:25.887 --> 00:53:28.208]  Maybe there's still something left in the Catholic Church.
[00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:30.568]  I think the Protestant Church has blown it.
[00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:34.369]  By the Catholics, you mean at least they're still against abortion?
[00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:42.371]  Well, I think they still believe that people have souls and that the purpose of religion is to save a soul.
[00:53:44.254 --> 00:53:54.544]  And I guess the church has been against the war, too, so that's a... Generally, they are against destruction of human life, whether it's war, abortion, capital punishment.
[00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:57.827]  They think life is something God gives.
[00:53:59.096 --> 00:53:59.977]  So I took the belt off.
[00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:02.098]  He ran his hands down over and pulled the pants down.
[00:54:02.118 --> 00:54:03.098]  They went down around my ankles.
[00:54:28.556 --> 00:54:32.539]  At that point, Perry was standing in his underwear in public view.
[00:54:32.879 --> 00:54:34.361]  He asked to see a supervisor.
[00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:35.782]  That made things worse.
[00:54:36.682 --> 00:54:38.824]  She was yelling, I have power!
[00:54:39.184 --> 00:54:39.945]  I have power!
[00:54:40.345 --> 00:54:41.126]  I have power!
[00:54:41.686 --> 00:54:47.731]  The power to stop him from flying to Florida with his wife that day to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary.
[00:54:48.271 --> 00:54:49.032]  Make you feel like
[00:54:49.631 --> 00:54:51.011]  You have no rights.
[00:54:51.392 --> 00:54:57.814]  Perry says he always alerts TSA agents about his metal knee and wonders why they can't just check his leg.
[00:54:58.174 --> 00:55:06.436]  If somebody told me that I'm going to save the people on the airplane by taking my pants off in public, I wouldn't mind doing it.
[00:55:06.896 --> 00:55:08.897]  But this was not necessary.
[00:55:09.197 --> 00:55:15.179]  TSA officials say that when the metal detector goes off, their agents must resolve what caused the alarm.
[00:55:15.618 --> 00:55:17.699]  Dr. Roberts, we know this is by design.
[00:55:17.939 --> 00:55:20.459]  I mean, they want to train us how to be slaves, as you've said.
[00:55:21.119 --> 00:55:24.900]  And people need to know that now they have the body scanners where they videotape your naked body.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:26.961]  And I'm not going through those.
[00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:33.082]  And you watch that same video where they beat people up for just not even rudely talking back.
[00:55:33.142 --> 00:55:37.083]  And now they're killing people behind closed doors at airports.
[00:55:37.143 --> 00:55:38.123]  I mean, where is it going to end?
[00:55:39.744 --> 00:55:41.964]  Well, when we stop being cheap.
[00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:46.492]  This guy running around, I.F.
[00:55:46.592 --> 00:55:48.173]  Power, somebody should have decked him.
[00:55:48.393 --> 00:55:50.234]  In fact, all the people there.
[00:55:51.054 --> 00:55:54.036]  There must have been hundreds of people waiting in those stupid lines.
[00:55:54.796 --> 00:56:00.559]  They should have attacked those transportation security people in mass and just beat the livid shit out of them.
[00:56:00.579 --> 00:56:05.822]  That's what they should have done.
[00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:06.122]  Oh my God.
[00:56:06.142 --> 00:56:08.183]  That's exactly what they should have done.
[00:56:08.223 --> 00:56:10.945]  They ought to pull these people, and they ought to strip them off.
[00:56:15.193 --> 00:56:19.154]  And when the cops come, they ought to turn over their cars and do the same thing to them.
[00:56:19.214 --> 00:56:26.997]  Until the people start standing up for themselves and realize that they're dealing with a bunch of fascist thugs.
[00:56:27.017 --> 00:56:27.717]  And less to revolt about.
[00:56:39.619 --> 00:56:40.279]  Well, that's true!
[00:56:40.379 --> 00:56:44.782]  In fact, it was in the article, and they put cameras up, the Chinese climb up and knock them down and throw fits!
[00:56:47.004 --> 00:56:50.426]  I mean, when Communist China, in many respects, is more free than we are, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:56:51.406 --> 00:56:52.467]  I agree that they are.
[00:56:52.707 --> 00:56:55.449]  Yes, they definitely are more free than we are.
[00:56:55.489 --> 00:56:57.250]  I've been there recently.
[00:56:58.231 --> 00:56:58.711]  Definitely.
[00:56:58.731 --> 00:56:59.832]  And they don't have the sphere.
[00:57:01.047 --> 00:57:05.309]  of government, and the government's not trying to instill fear in the population.
[00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:24.371]  Take care.
[00:57:25.332 --> 00:57:26.373]  What a way to end the show.
[00:57:26.913 --> 00:57:29.534]  More details, Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura.
[00:57:29.835 --> 00:57:31.095]  Looks like it's probably going to happen.
[00:57:31.115 --> 00:57:35.198]  We just got to figure out in the next few months at short notice if we can get a venue big enough to do this.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.420]  So that's up on the site.
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:44.864]  We're going into very bad waters here, but a lot of people are waking up and we can say no to this.
[00:57:46.210 --> 00:57:52.955]  We got a bunch of sick social engineers doing all this by design, bringing us into a global crisis by design, and we had to learn to say no.
[00:57:53.476 --> 00:57:54.336]  My mom called up.
[00:57:54.356 --> 00:57:55.037]  She never calls the office.
[00:57:55.057 --> 00:58:02.442]  I don't think my mother's ever called the office in a decade plus of a radio show, said, wish your uncle a happy birthday, because he was on the show earlier today.
[00:58:02.562 --> 00:58:03.483]  I didn't know it was your birthday.
[00:58:03.503 --> 00:58:04.063]  Happy birthday.
[00:58:04.083 --> 00:58:05.404]  It's also Burmese's birthday.
[00:58:06.886 --> 00:58:11.509]  So, you guys all have the same birthday there.
[00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:13.651]  All right, take us out of here, John.
[00:58:13.671 --> 00:58:15.192]  I don't hear my illustrious bumper music.
[00:58:16.409 --> 00:58:24.535]  I do want to encourage all of the listeners to please remember rebroadcast with Ron Paul and everybody else.
[00:58:24.815 --> 00:58:26.576]  Jim Mars with his new book on the Nazis.
[00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.898]  It's all up on Infowars.com.
[00:58:29.098 --> 00:58:32.340]  Retransmission on the audio starts right now for internet listeners.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.882]  For everybody else, back live tomorrow on the MNFM Dial.
[00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:36.022]  But the show starts again.
[00:58:36.082 --> 00:58:36.823]  All the stuff you missed.
[00:58:37.103 --> 00:58:39.545]  It's a new show for those that haven't heard it at Infowars.com.
