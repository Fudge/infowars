[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:06.038]  He witnessed the WTC7 explosions dead at age 53.
[00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:36.210]  Ira Hayes, Emergency Coordinator, a 9-11 witness, Barry Jennings, has passed away with controversy about WTC7 still hot, as the BBC hit piece and this report have been released to counter Jennings' exclusive testimony on explosions inside Building 7.
[00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.251]  Now, we interviewed him for loose change, final cut, he then
[00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:44.517]  Word got out about it.
[00:00:44.557 --> 00:00:52.061]  He begged us, saying he'd been threatened, saying his pension had been threatened, his job had been threatened, and other threats.
[00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:53.622]  Wouldn't specify what those were.
[00:00:54.562 --> 00:00:58.004]  If he didn't shut up, then he didn't really recant.
[00:00:58.044 --> 00:01:01.606]  He said, yeah, there were explosions, yeah, before the towers fell in Building 7.
[00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:04.548]  And he said, well, it could have been bodies.
[00:01:04.628 --> 00:01:06.389]  But earlier he said they were bodies on the ground.
[00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.151]  Then his boss,
[00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:19.850]  Just came out in the last few weeks and was interviewed by the BBC saying, I never saw explosions.
[00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.613]  Though he had said that on news that day along with Mr. Jennings.
[00:01:23.674 --> 00:01:25.216]  Very suspicious that he's dead at 53.
[00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:31.283]  Now it was Aaron Dykes who confirmed this yesterday.
[00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:33.645]  We kept hearing about it for weeks but could find no news articles.
[00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:38.886]  Earlier, others had called where he worked with the city.
[00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:41.328]  They said, no, no, we're not going to talk about it.
[00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.473]  We finally got them to admit yesterday that he indeed was dead, but they wouldn't say the cause.
[00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:48.215]  We've now talked to his bosses.
[00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:49.676]  They've said, yeah, we knew Barry.
[00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:50.417]  He is dead.
[00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.600]  We can't say why he's dead.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.524]  Others said at the office, we don't know why he's dead and acted very, very suspicious.
[00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.292]  So, we're going to be breaking this down in the next 45 minutes or so with Aaron Dykes and Jason Bermas, who personally knew Barry Jennings.
[00:02:14.012 --> 00:02:18.033]  Let me just read over this article for everybody and then make some added points on it.
[00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:30.596]  Emergency Coordinator 9-11 witness Barry Jennings has passed away with controversy about WTC7 still hot as the BBC hit piece and NIST report have been released to counter Jennings' exclusive testimony of explosions inside Building 7.
[00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:32.557]  Now that's
[00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:46.192]  We can say exclusive, but really, his boss talked about explosions, firefighters and police talked about it, EMTs talked about it, there's cops on CNN saying, get back, they're going to blow it up, it's going to come down, and the owners said they blew it up.
[00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:51.995]  So, the problem is, see, he's credible because he was the deputy emergency manager of that area.
[00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:54.396]  So that's why they had to get rid of him.
[00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:58.858]  And I have no doubt they killed him, and there's a 95% chance, especially now that they're being very secretive,
[00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:07.936]  Barry Jennings, a key 9-11 eyewitness, who was an emergency coordinator for the New York Housing Authority, has passed away at age 53 from circumstances not yet disclosed.
[00:03:09.377 --> 00:03:10.658]  This is almost a month later, folks.
[00:03:10.698 --> 00:03:11.399]  Very suspicious.
[00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:18.884]  Kind of like it was very hard to find out that Dr. Ivins with the anthrax, who they now admit was a patsy, was killed inside government facilities.
[00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:26.249]  A spokesman for the Housing Authority has now confirmed his death after weeks of rumors circulating online, but refused to give any further details.
[00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.429]  We talked to him again this morning.
[00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.110]  Aaron's coming up.
[00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:41.841]  The office has not yet been able to contact anyone in the Jennings family, and the official cause of death is not yet known, but online reports have reported the date of the death as August 19, 2008.
[00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:51.306]  Since yesterday, we have confirmed with his office the date is the 19th.
[00:03:53.759 --> 00:04:01.184]  In a very unusual, it is very unusual that a prominent, controversial 9-11 witness would die only days before the release of the NIS report.
[00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:03.605]  See, people say, well why seven years later was he killed?
[00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:05.086]  This was all coming out.
[00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:12.391]  There was talk of subpoenaing him, that they're about to probably get enough signatures to have it on the ballot for a New York investigation of 9-11.
[00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:15.633]  Talk of calling him before a grand jury.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:39.780]  It is very unusual that a prominent and controversial 9-11 witness would die only days before the release of this report on WTC7 and shortly after a firestorm erupted over the testimony that he had heard explosions inside the building prior to the collapse of either tower and that they were dead bodies in the building blown out of the lobby.
[00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:57.738]  The BBC aired The Third Tower in July in an attempt to debunk Mary Jennings' account, which is both contradictory and damaging to the official 9-11 story, making an issue over whether or not he saw dead bodies in the lobby.
[00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.599]  And see, we hadn't released this video because he'd asked us not to.
[00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:07.421]  Then the BBC came to the Loose Change crew and to Dylan and said, you're lying, he didn't say that, and Dylan showed them the video.
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.903]  So they went and had an actor play the part of Jennings to basically reenact things in a false fashion.
[00:05:18.364 --> 00:05:19.224]  Very suspicious.
[00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:34.612]  Yet Jennings' own statement in an exclusive interview with Dylan Avery and Jason Mermis, which has not been denied, was the firefighter who took us down kept saying, don't look down, and I say why, and we are stepping over people, you know, you can feel when you're stepping over people.
[00:05:36.817 --> 00:05:42.645]  We're going to continue with this on the other side with Jason Mermis and in studio Aaron Dykes, who ferreted this out.
[00:05:43.746 --> 00:05:50.435]  And we're going to tie this into the DC Madam and other high-profile murders, assassinations like Vince Foster.
[00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:52.899]  We're on the march.
[00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:54.080]  The Empire.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.601]  Hey Jones.
[00:05:57.105 --> 00:05:57.725]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:05:57.905 --> 00:06:01.127]  The firefighter who took us down kept saying, don't look down.
[00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:02.788]  And I say, why?
[00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:04.108]  And we are stepping over people.
[00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:07.050]  You know, you can feel when you're stepping over people.
[00:06:09.211 --> 00:06:15.053]  We're going to continue with this on the other side with Jason Bermas and in studio Aaron Dykes, who ferreted this out.
[00:06:16.154 --> 00:06:22.757]  And we're going to tie this into the DC Madam and other high profile murders, assassinations like Vince Foster.
[00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:27.298]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:06:28.218 --> 00:06:31.021]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:34.183 --> 00:06:40.609]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:42.611]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:06:43.576 --> 00:06:44.596]  But who is the enemy?
[00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:45.657]  Bin Laden.
[00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:46.957]  This is his ammo.
[00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:48.217]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:49.978]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:57.020]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.880]  Some U.S.
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.582]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:07:04.262 --> 00:07:07.725]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:10.848]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:07:33.902 --> 00:07:38.646]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:45.331]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:54.418]  By calling 908-691-2608 or visiting hempusa.org, you can benefit from this wonderful natural food source.
[00:07:55.078 --> 00:08:02.520]  Our customers are also purchasing this natural food for long-term storage, camping, survival and emergency food rations.

[00:08:08.562 --> 00:08:16.505]  Hempusa.org believes that now is the time to plan for the future and food will be your greatest asset.
[00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:23.887]  People spend money on all kinds of things, but our warning is prepare now for food shortages in the future.
[00:08:24.736 --> 00:08:26.757]  So don't delay, call today.
[00:08:26.777 --> 00:08:33.441]  908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you.
[00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:43.867]  Cameras are everywhere, above stoplights, on toll booths and scamming the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[00:08:44.227 --> 00:08:47.509]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:52.171]  Spray Your Plate is a spray-on photoblocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:58.493]  Spray Your Plate Photoblocker Spray reflects and protects against flash photo images, making your plate unreadable.
[00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:01.975]  One can of photoblocker will pay for itself many times over.
[00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:10.559]  Last... Woah, boom, bop-a-boom.
[00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:16.342]  Okay, Barry Jennings, a key 9-11 witness.
[00:09:17.243 --> 00:09:19.606]  Deputy head of that sector of emergency management.
[00:09:19.986 --> 00:09:23.950]  He's there with the head of it.
[00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.292]  The north and south tower have not fallen.
[00:09:27.394 --> 00:09:28.475]  And there's huge explosions.
[00:09:28.515 --> 00:09:29.616]  They fall down to the floor.
[00:09:30.116 --> 00:09:30.897]  There's dead bodies.
[00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:31.878]  They're stepping over them.
[00:09:32.921 --> 00:09:43.651]  He goes out and tells Fox News, ABC News, that the day of the event with rubble all over him, with some of the people that helped, he and other quote, officials out of the building.
[00:09:44.032 --> 00:09:45.873]  And they're all there with eyewitnesses saying what they saw.
[00:09:46.474 --> 00:09:48.456]  Then the Loose Change crew goes and interviews him.
[00:09:49.096 --> 00:09:50.858]  Word gets out that it's going to be in the final cut.
[00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:51.939]  He says, I'm getting threatened.
[00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:53.220]  I'm getting my job threatened.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.803]  I'm getting my pension threatened and other things.
[00:09:55.923 --> 00:09:56.844]  Please don't release it.
[00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:02.991]  But then the BBC goes to him to do this hit piece, but he didn't really say what they want.
[00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:04.012]  They all heavily edited.
[00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:06.732]  They have an actor basically say what they want him to say in it.
[00:10:07.593 --> 00:10:09.113]  They don't show him with other people in the building.
[00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:11.154]  They only show him alone in the reenactment.
[00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:15.975]  But it's not him as the person who's reenacting it.
[00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:20.107]  And so he becomes this big figure in this big controversy.
[00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:25.473]  You've got the firefighters and police outside, live news footage of them saying, get back, Building 7 is going to be blown up.
[00:10:26.494 --> 00:10:29.898]  We have the owner slipping up and saying, yeah, we ordered it blown up.
[00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:36.346]  We have all of this coming out, and so Jennings starts becoming a key figure, and a couple days before the NIS report,
[00:10:37.273 --> 00:10:54.184]  Which then said all its other five reasons, 25% of the building scooped out by the North Tower, fires, bad craftsmanship, improper building, fuel oil tanks, all of that, they said, no, we were wrong about all that.
[00:10:54.204 --> 00:11:00.027]  It didn't scoop out the building, it didn't do any of this, it was magnetic forces and thermal expansion never before seen.
[00:11:00.848 --> 00:11:01.228]  Magic!
[00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:05.691]  And then the guys on NIST all got government contracts, government operatives,
[00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:23.260]  Who happen to be some of the only few living experts on explosive thermite for NASA coupler rings when the rocket separates in the different stages, and for classified Pentagon programs with weaponized thermite, just so happens in the samples.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.241]  I'll show that in the video of it pouring out.
[00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:28.603]  I mean, we're getting very close to the ultimate Sherlock Holmes here.
[00:11:29.443 --> 00:11:30.644]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[00:11:31.633 --> 00:11:38.557]  Some Secret Service agents and FBI guys were on the trail of this, and they got killed and had their bodies thrown in to Building 7.
[00:11:38.617 --> 00:11:43.219]  Then the media lied about that, but later had to admit, okay, there were some dead feds in there.
[00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:50.683]  It was also a way to get rid of people that noticed what was going on.
[00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:54.345]  So finishing up this story, key witness to the WTC7 explosion is dead at 53.
[00:11:57.938 --> 00:12:03.222]  Now comes the release of Jason Bermes' fabled enemies and giving further exposure to Jennings' controversial account.
[00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:18.912]  The film features a full interview with Barry Jennings as well as the statements by Michael Hess who was also trapped with him inside the WTC7 made to news media on the day of the attacks.
[00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:20.093]  He said the same stuff.
[00:12:20.713 --> 00:12:26.117]  Now he went with the BBC, the same guy that did the first hit piece, who we know went back and interviewed Jennings again
[00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.251]  And then Jennings dies soon after.
[00:12:29.271 --> 00:12:53.065]  And then his boss, the head of that emergency management division, he says, I never made those statements, when he's on video saying, kind of like, before Congress and on ABC News, Giuliani says, yeah, we were told to get out of building seven that day before either tower fell, and we had a terror attack drill with FEMA set up the night before, so we'd already moved out of the building the night before in tripod two.
[00:12:53.525 --> 00:12:54.306]  And people said, what?
[00:12:54.906 --> 00:13:03.851]  Of course, FEMA Deputy Director earlier, Kennedy, had said just that, and then there was a big controversy the day of 9-11, that, well, we already arrived the night before for the terror attack.
[00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:05.952]  They said, oh no, that was a mistake, slip of the tongue.
[00:13:06.132 --> 00:13:19.940]  Then it came out they indeed had, and it was called Operation Tripod 2, of an anthrax attack on Building 7 in the World Trade Center complexes, which they'd used in months before to evacuate the whole building, several times for drills and a billion-dollar renovation.
[00:13:20.936 --> 00:13:23.718]  of the service floors.
[00:13:23.738 --> 00:13:27.260]  It has service floors, every few floors, and side passages.
[00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:30.442]  And Marvin Bush running that, of course.
[00:13:30.883 --> 00:13:31.703]  No big deal.
[00:13:31.983 --> 00:13:32.464]  Confirm it.
[00:13:32.664 --> 00:13:33.424]  Go confirm it for yourself.
[00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:35.325]  Our source on that is Barbara Bush.
[00:13:37.687 --> 00:13:40.689]  Her memoir written four years ago about her great son running security there.
[00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.970]  Nice people.
[00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:56.785]  Barry Jennings reiterated in the exclusive interview from his confusion over the explanation for WTC7's collapse, given that he clearly heard explosions inside the building.
[00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:01.834]  I'm just confused about one thing and one thing only.
[00:14:02.134 --> 00:14:05.516]  Why World Trade Center 7 went down in the first place, I'm very confused about that.
[00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:07.037]  I know what I heard.
[00:14:07.157 --> 00:14:08.038]  I heard explosions.
[00:14:08.418 --> 00:14:11.459]  The explanation I got was it was the fuel oil tank.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.000]  I'm an old boiler guy.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.641]  This was a fuel oil tank.
[00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:17.443]  It would have been on one side of the building.
[00:14:19.584 --> 00:14:21.625]  And of course now the government admits that's not the boiler tank.
[00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:23.346]  They just tell the dumbed-down public that.
[00:14:24.585 --> 00:14:33.109]  The interview was not fully released until 2008 at the request of Mr. Jennings, who had received numerous threats to his job and asked that it be left out of loose change final cut because of those threats.
[00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:34.489]  He'd still be alive, folks.
[00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:39.972]  I'm almost 95% sure that it was a murder, especially now how they won't say what caused it.
[00:14:42.053 --> 00:14:52.297]  Jennings' statements have lit a fire to questions about what really caused the sudden collapse of WTC7, just as NIST had hoped the release of their report would quash widespread beliefs that the building was brought down by controlled demolition.
[00:14:54.361 --> 00:15:07.050]  Now, news of Jennings' death comes on the heels of losing another 9-11 hero and eyewitness, Kenny Johneman, who reportedly committed suicide 12 days before the 7th anniversary.
[00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:13.234]  He's credited with saving at least one man's life on 9-11, and was also a witness to explosions in the towers.
[00:15:14.096 --> 00:15:30.532]  This report, as well as on the 9-11 Commission, which is not even mentioned Building 7, completely ignores statements from the Building 7 leaseholder Larry Silverstein, as well as numerous police and firefighters and other eyewitnesses who have testified that they were warned about the building's collapse and told to get back because it was going to be a controlled demolition.
[00:15:31.092 --> 00:15:35.837]  One rescue worker even heard the countdown from the building's implosion over the emergency radios.
[00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:44.183]  Unfortunately, Barry Jennings, whose testimony was ignored by the 9-11 Commission, can no longer raise questions personally about his experience inside WTC7.
[00:15:44.884 --> 00:15:53.571]  But his account will remain on the record and available in full on Fabled Enemies DVD so that what he witnessed about 9-11 cannot be ignored.
[00:15:55.128 --> 00:15:59.309]  The truth about WTC7 will continue to come out and Barry Jennings' testimony will not be in vain.
[00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:05.151]  Please contact Aaron at InfoWars.com if you have any information about the circumstances of Barry Jennings' death or any other reports.
[00:16:05.892 --> 00:16:09.313]  We extend our condolences to any family or friends regarding
[00:16:11.109 --> 00:16:11.929]  this for their loss.
[00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:18.371]  And Aaron, I want you to go add specifically who you called, who you talked to, in what agency.
[00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:22.432]  It's not enough to say, you did a good job here, that we confirmed it with his agency.
[00:16:22.992 --> 00:16:26.553]  Because the disinfo trolls know the public doesn't really pay attention.
[00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:30.614]  So as you know, they're running around saying, oh we got this off a YouTube post.
[00:16:31.134 --> 00:16:35.395]  No, we ignored this for two weeks and investigated and could never get them to tell us.
[00:16:36.115 --> 00:16:39.338]  We've now got calls in to the head of public relations at his agency.
[00:16:39.638 --> 00:16:41.440]  We've talked to four or five secretaries.
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.761]  We've talked to his former assistant.
[00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.682]  We've talked to the person that took his job.
[00:16:44.923 --> 00:16:46.063]  We have his extension.
[00:16:46.324 --> 00:16:47.425]  We have his home number.
[00:16:48.606 --> 00:16:50.227]  Barry Jennings is dead.
[00:16:51.368 --> 00:16:52.589]  And he died a month ago.
[00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.632]  He died just shy of two days.
[00:16:56.132 --> 00:16:57.553]  In two days it'll be a month ago.
[00:16:57.733 --> 00:16:58.254]  Or thirty days.
[00:16:58.954 --> 00:16:59.435]  He's dead.
[00:17:00.862 --> 00:17:05.825]  Okay, now when we first posted the Larry Silverstein video, five years ago, people said it was fake.
[00:17:06.745 --> 00:17:09.167]  They said it wasn't real, of Larry Silverstein saying it.
[00:17:09.187 --> 00:17:15.930]  Then we posted the Building 7 footage of BBC, saying it had been blown up and had fallen, Building 7.
[00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:24.755]  People said that was fake, that we made a fake video, that it was a blue screen, and then BBC said no, it was real, and then it turned out two BBC channels reported it at the same time, and CNN.
[00:17:26.824 --> 00:17:30.186]  And that's now confirmed, that they reported Building 7 fell before it fell exactly how it fell.
[00:17:30.827 --> 00:17:44.376]  Kind of like they reported that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy, and it was in newspapers in Asia and in the other hemisphere, the other side of the planet, in Australia, over an hour before he was even caught and his name was public.
[00:17:44.636 --> 00:17:46.497]  They got their time zone screwed up.
[00:17:47.998 --> 00:17:54.623]  And we said it was probably Reuters or AP, because they have pre-release feeds that BBC and CNN reported
[00:17:55.871 --> 00:18:24.582]  the fall of building seven and then we were right bbc now admits that so we know how the new system works and we're giving you cutting-edge pull a surprise type investigative journalism okay and all we ask is that you look at it and understand what's happening closure might let me let me just explain something to you here
[00:18:25.495 --> 00:18:38.149]  Before I go to Jason Bermas and Aaron Dykes about this, in the last two months I have seen hundreds of articles by the mainstream, by the alternative, by former 9-11 truth people showing their colors.
[00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:40.232]  Hundreds.
[00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:44.616]  I saw in my email box five or six last night.
[00:18:45.535 --> 00:18:59.604]  I did a Google search for like two hours and was just blown away by different people on YouTube, Google, Dig, on videos, on alternative websites, saying one thing unanimously over and over and over again.
[00:19:04.013 --> 00:19:04.994]  Are they all feds?
[00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:05.515]  No!
[00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:07.176]  That's what Operation Mockingbird is.
[00:19:07.356 --> 00:19:10.299]  A few feds put it out, and then it snowballed.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.500]  It picks up.
[00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:13.222]  Mockingbirds repeat it.
[00:19:13.843 --> 00:19:16.885]  State Bird of Texas, it hears a lawnmower, it makes a lawnmower noise.
[00:19:16.925 --> 00:19:18.307]  It hears a dog barking, makes that noise.
[00:19:18.587 --> 00:19:23.212]  Amazing little birds, little black and white birds, little brown and cream and black colored birds, that part doesn't matter.
[00:19:23.732 --> 00:19:24.393]  The point is,
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:53.832]  You've got governors, and movie stars, and best actress, and Willie Nelson, and German defense ministers, and famous Italian presidents, and Italian intelligence chiefs, and leaders of major Japanese parties, and physicists, and scientists, and peer-reviewed reports, and peer-reviewed journals saying impossible what happened with Tower 1, 2, and 7, and exploding, and now inside job, and false flag terrorism, and self-inflicted wound,
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:58.669]  is now in the general nomenclature.
[00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:05.374]  People now know about this!
[00:20:07.516 --> 00:20:12.160]  This is one of the most incredible grassroots movements ever, by any yardstick.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.644]  It is taking the tool of staged terror events and smashing them.
[00:20:17.884 --> 00:20:22.348]  It is exposing people to how governments stage crises.
[00:20:23.476 --> 00:20:28.379]  Whether they're economic or environmental to then pose as the saviors and get even more control.
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:37.806]  And people are reading the philosopher Hegel and the Straussian economist ideas of the Injustifies the Means, the Machiavellian system at the Chicago Business School.
[00:20:38.902 --> 00:20:42.303]  They're reading the PNAC documents where Dick Cheney said we need staged terror attacks.
[00:20:42.663 --> 00:20:45.384]  They're reading this in Army War College reports.
[00:20:45.905 --> 00:20:47.365]  This is an epiphany.
[00:20:47.845 --> 00:20:49.766]  This is a huge thing.
[00:20:50.086 --> 00:20:51.467]  It's exploding exponentially.
[00:20:51.947 --> 00:20:53.528]  You know, we had Rob on early in the morning.
[00:20:54.808 --> 00:20:56.369]  We're at the first show in the middle of the day.
[00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:58.369]  There were like 300 or 400 people out there.
[00:20:58.389 --> 00:20:59.010]  There were 3,000.
[00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.750]  I've seen the videos.
[00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.391]  And the news reported biggest 9-11 truth ever in New York.
[00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:08.008]  But see, the system knows that the public is watching the mainstream media, so they have to be careful.
[00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:16.894]  But our own movement is in a concerted fashion saying 9-11 Truth is dead.
[00:21:16.914 --> 00:21:18.675]  9-11 Truth peaked in 2006.
[00:21:18.855 --> 00:21:21.797]  I'm seeing the same terms put out.
[00:21:22.417 --> 00:21:23.538]  And that's what these guys will do.
[00:21:23.558 --> 00:21:32.024]  They'll come on the scene, they'll be patriots for about a year, machine this over and over again, they'll try to gain credibility, and then they'll just run their operation.
[00:21:33.288 --> 00:21:36.669]  And that's kind of like telling somebody if you don't want them to come to, say, an auction.
[00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.270]  Oh, that auction's canceled.
[00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.490]  That's happened a lot in the news.
[00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:42.412]  People that want to bid on something will find out the email list.
[00:21:42.612 --> 00:21:53.156]  They'll break into the auction house or have an employee give it to them and send out a thing to all the auction regulars saying, oh, the Tuesday night auction of firearms or paintings or whatever, it's canceled.
[00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:59.762]  And then they'll show up, or there's going to be a city council meeting to steal some private property or do something that's unpopular.
[00:22:00.182 --> 00:22:03.945]  They do this all the time with the different Trans-Texas Corridor boards.
[00:22:04.205 --> 00:22:07.888]  They're always canceling it, but then the day of, well, we're not going to cancel it now.
[00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:14.573]  Well, they just, so they've been announcing, oh, 9-11 Truth's dead, 9-11 Truth's over.
[00:22:14.913 --> 00:22:16.134]  Meanwhile, it's bigger than ever.
[00:22:18.056 --> 00:22:23.480]  And their operatives are being forced to show themselves because they are afraid of you taking over live media, like in The Running Man.
[00:22:24.568 --> 00:22:25.129]  But peacefully.
[00:22:25.629 --> 00:22:30.374]  They're afraid of you getting in front of news cameras and bullhorning and holding up signs and creating buzz.
[00:22:30.634 --> 00:22:45.209]  They're afraid of, not just 9-11 Truth, but that idea of getting in front of media and going to media events and disrupting these staged town halls where only supporters of whatever it may be, toll roads or Republicans or Democrats or open borders or gun control or environmental land grabs.
[00:22:47.216 --> 00:23:00.083]  They are scared of that idea of you getting out in the streets, getting active, not just dressing up, you know, and having the fake paid-off hippie leaders dress up in wizard outfits and levitate mints, Foundation paid off, you know, to make everybody look like clowns.
[00:23:00.103 --> 00:23:10.109]  They're afraid, and they saw just a few hundred at 9-11 Truth in Denver take over and get all the media attention and absolutely dominate, and they are panicking and attacking everywhere.
[00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:16.513]  I mean, they are so upset by all these prominent people going public, and it's exponential.
[00:23:16.573 --> 00:23:18.295]  We have passed Critical Mass.
[00:23:19.255 --> 00:23:20.697]  We have passed Flashpoint.
[00:23:21.237 --> 00:23:23.079]  You have done an incredible job.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.901]  But they're telling you, oh, the party's over.
[00:23:25.981 --> 00:23:26.402]  It's over.
[00:23:27.402 --> 00:23:28.023]  It petered out.
[00:23:28.063 --> 00:23:28.644]  It's dead.
[00:23:29.925 --> 00:23:31.406]  When it is bigger than ever.
[00:23:32.507 --> 00:23:34.669]  All the 9-11 truth sites getting more visits than ever.
[00:23:36.796 --> 00:23:39.437]  I mean, my site's getting more visits than ever.
[00:23:40.178 --> 00:23:42.239]  Just people all over waking up.
[00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:43.439]  It being mainstream.
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:53.264]  Going from the police being mad at us eight years ago, or seven years ago, or six years ago, when we talk about inside job to chanting 9-1-1's an inside job with us in New York.
[00:23:53.544 --> 00:23:54.085]  That happened.
[00:23:54.205 --> 00:23:55.005]  There's video of it.
[00:23:57.706 --> 00:24:00.348]  The system is panicking right now.
[00:24:00.388 --> 00:24:01.568]  And so they're killing people.
[00:24:02.209 --> 00:24:03.309]  There will be more murders, no doubt.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.202]  They are trying to intimidate witnesses.
[00:24:08.104 --> 00:24:10.749]  They are running around saying, you know, Mark Twain is dead.
[00:24:10.769 --> 00:24:14.315]  And he said, no, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.431]  It's the oldest trick in the book.
[00:24:18.172 --> 00:24:19.593]  Do not buy this.
[00:24:19.673 --> 00:24:23.736]  But they noticed that from their own mainline media, people weren't buying it.
[00:24:23.776 --> 00:24:25.277]  So they're activating their officers.
[00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:26.518]  They're activating their agents.
[00:24:26.879 --> 00:24:28.480]  They're activating their sleepers.
[00:24:29.241 --> 00:24:32.964]  Right now, everywhere, to tell you it's dead, because they are panicking.
[00:24:33.204 --> 00:24:35.065]  And they know it's dangerous to reveal themselves.
[00:24:35.766 --> 00:24:37.607]  They know it's dangerous to expose themselves.
[00:24:38.008 --> 00:24:40.670]  They know it's dangerous to show everybody who they are.
[00:24:41.698 --> 00:24:43.519]  But they're being forced to right now.
[00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:49.181]  We're going to go to Jason Burmiss and Aaron Dykes and others in just a moment.
[00:24:50.962 --> 00:24:53.383]  But Barry Jennings could have said more, would have said more.
[00:24:53.443 --> 00:24:56.864]  He could have been hauled in before a grand jury and been forced to talk about everything he saw.
[00:24:58.045 --> 00:25:02.727]  His testimony could have contradicted Michael Hess's and was.
[00:25:04.307 --> 00:25:08.109]  He wasn't giving the BBC the type of interviews they wanted, and that's a spook outfit all the way.
[00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:09.686]  And he's dead.
[00:25:10.387 --> 00:25:11.428]  Deader than a hammer right now.
[00:25:11.649 --> 00:25:12.910]  Deader than a doornail.
[00:25:14.292 --> 00:25:15.895]  And again, our condolences go to the family.
[00:25:17.116 --> 00:25:18.999]  And so, I'm going to bring up Jason Burnham.
[00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:22.744]  I'm going to bring up Aaron Dykes.
[00:25:22.784 --> 00:25:25.327]  But before we got a break, just briefly, Aaron.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.925]  Describe how you made some phone calls and confirmed this.
[00:25:30.165 --> 00:25:33.310]  We never reported this off of YouTube postings.
[00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.833]  That's where we first learned of it.
[00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:37.796]  We reported this from his agency.
[00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:39.359]  So tell folks about that first.
[00:25:39.926 --> 00:25:48.534]  That's right, we saw the YouTube comments, and I had a horrible feeling in my gut, but we of course did not report the rumors, and for weeks we couldn't get the numbers.
[00:25:49.215 --> 00:25:57.763]  Finally, I contacted the New York City Housing Authority at their publicly listed numbers, and I was able to finally reach Barry Jennings.
[00:25:57.823 --> 00:26:00.666]  I spoke to four people who all confirmed he's dead.
[00:26:01.247 --> 00:26:02.268]  None of them would say why.
[00:26:02.288 --> 00:26:03.349]  That's the basics.
[00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.351]  And we've got the numbers, we've got their names here.
[00:26:07.751 --> 00:26:16.672]  You talked to secretaries, you talked to his former assistant, you talked to his replacement, you talked to managers, and they all will not tell you.
[00:26:17.453 --> 00:26:22.734]  Yeah, but even people on the switchboard knew who he was, they knew he was dead, but they still couldn't tell me why.
[00:26:23.334 --> 00:26:24.174]  At least not at this time.
[00:26:24.214 --> 00:26:29.115]  And we're 28 days later, he dies right before the NIS report comes out, this testimony contradicts.
[00:26:29.135 --> 00:26:33.696]  And then we've got Hess, who's contradicting his TV interviews he did seven years ago.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.720]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.781]  It's just, I don't know how he could get away with that.
[00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:38.542]  He's on record.
[00:26:38.982 --> 00:26:41.463]  We have the recording and now he says he heard no explosions.
[00:26:41.963 --> 00:26:42.903]  Michael Hess is a liar.
[00:26:44.484 --> 00:26:45.164]  It's unbelievable.
[00:26:45.204 --> 00:26:46.265]  Jason Burma's on his side.
[00:26:46.285 --> 00:26:48.166]  He knew Barry Jennings, met with him several times.
[00:26:48.506 --> 00:26:49.766]  We have the Jennings' home phone number.
[00:26:49.786 --> 00:26:50.927]  They're not answering the phone.
[00:26:51.587 --> 00:26:54.788]  But we have a right, as the public, to find out how he died and what happened.
[00:26:55.109 --> 00:26:58.190]  They also threaten families and tell them to shut up, so we'll see what happens there.
[00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.651]  In fact, I'm going to skip this break.
[00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:00.231]  We'll continue.
[00:27:01.277 --> 00:27:03.699]  I'm going to skip the break for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:08.183]  We are streaming live right now and InfoWars.com stream listeners.
[00:27:09.124 --> 00:27:13.287]  I want to just give out some facts right now in this three-minute behind-the-scenes.
[00:27:13.607 --> 00:27:18.231]  Then we'll go to Bermas after the break.
[00:27:19.392 --> 00:27:27.239]  But I would challenge everyone out there watching to go read this story for yourself from InfoWars.com.
[00:27:29.195 --> 00:27:32.156]  Key witness to WTC7 explosions, dead at 53.
[00:27:32.336 --> 00:27:34.256]  Now, I want to explain something.
[00:27:35.357 --> 00:27:47.200]  The first people that always come on the scene on our message board, we have their IP addresses, we can go look them up, and the first people to come on the scene on YouTube, on the comments with any of these videos or stories, they don't even hide it.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:53.302]  You will go to their pages and then use their handle, and then find their MySpace or Facebook, and they're almost always CENTCOM.
[00:27:53.322 --> 00:27:54.602]  They're military, paid to do it.
[00:27:55.462 --> 00:27:57.903]  And they'll arrive, and then they have mockingbirds that copy them.
[00:27:58.834 --> 00:28:09.777]  You know, just kind of the verbose, unhappy, just real negative, toxic population.
[00:28:09.837 --> 00:28:10.238]  Morbid.
[00:28:10.998 --> 00:28:15.479]  And then they'll pile on, but within minutes, I mean, the intelligence is watching our websites.
[00:28:15.699 --> 00:28:18.520]  Within minutes of this going up, it was, oh, you got it off YouTube, huh?
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:19.400]  You got it off Rumors.
[00:28:20.441 --> 00:28:21.901]  Which we never even said in the article.
[00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:23.121]  They were on it, folks.
[00:28:23.181 --> 00:28:24.502]  They were waiting.
[00:28:24.522 --> 00:28:27.843]  And we say, no, we got this from the New York Housing Authority.
[00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:33.944]  That he was the Deputy Emergency, you know, Head of Emergency Management for during the attacks and was promoted after that.
[00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:35.950]  And he was there with the head of it, during it.
[00:28:36.917 --> 00:28:37.517]  Michael Hess.
[00:28:38.318 --> 00:28:45.280]  And so here it is in plain view, we're saying what it is, but they psychologically divert people to then make that about the debate.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:54.523]  Kind of like, we never have a debate about who we want in the North American Union, because it doesn't matter if we have all the documents and it's official being done, and the Pentagon's signing deals with Canada to use their troops here in the U.S.
[00:28:54.843 --> 00:28:57.344]  against the American people in Mexico, and it's in the Army Times.
[00:28:58.224 --> 00:29:00.305]  But then you say, we don't want that, and they say it doesn't exist.
[00:29:01.305 --> 00:29:02.046]  It's the same thing here.
[00:29:02.086 --> 00:29:04.708]  They'll just say, no, Michael Hess never said that.
[00:29:04.768 --> 00:29:07.150]  Doesn't matter if you have video of it on two different news channels.
[00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:08.351]  Doesn't exist.
[00:29:10.232 --> 00:29:12.094]  And then you have a debate about, well, yes it does.
[00:29:12.114 --> 00:29:12.875]  He said it here.
[00:29:13.135 --> 00:29:14.596]  And then you never move on to your evidence.
[00:29:15.136 --> 00:29:16.397]  It's just a stumbling block.
[00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:20.181]  It's a basic psychological warfare operation.
[00:29:20.321 --> 00:29:22.603]  And that's what we have being run against us here.
[00:29:22.703 --> 00:29:27.066]  And so on the subject of 9-11 Truth, don't let Barry Jennings die in vain.
[00:29:27.447 --> 00:29:30.049]  Don't let all the other people that have died in vain and been murdered over this.
[00:29:31.267 --> 00:29:37.031]  I mean, Luke was getting death threats at the time he first started confronting politicians.
[00:29:37.451 --> 00:29:44.676]  But we're told by the people in our own movement, oh, it's not effective to go take over media events and ask embarrassing questions of politicians.
[00:29:44.756 --> 00:29:45.077]  Oh, really?
[00:29:45.437 --> 00:29:49.840]  Of Giuliani, where it then became national news that he did lie about being told to get out of Building 7?
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.221]  And then he was warned?
[00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:54.692]  I mean, breaking news over and over again?
[00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:56.413]  They're scared to death of you!
[00:29:56.994 --> 00:29:59.536]  You have incredible power, so keep it up!
[00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:01.557]  Let's go back to the full show.
[00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.191]  Alright, I'm going to get into all the economic news.
[00:30:08.271 --> 00:30:09.391]  Attacks on free speech.
[00:30:10.051 --> 00:30:15.633]  They're going ahead and implementing on the web the Free Speech Attacking Homegrown Radicalization Act.
[00:30:16.394 --> 00:30:17.794]  The bill, H.R.
[00:30:18.454 --> 00:30:19.815]  1955 before it's even passed the Senate.
[00:30:20.255 --> 00:30:23.516]  Just like they implement National ID Card before it came into law eight years before.
[00:30:24.737 --> 00:30:27.378]  They're doing that now to come after your free speech.
[00:30:27.398 --> 00:30:28.218]  That's coming up later.
[00:30:28.438 --> 00:30:30.079]  Big economic analysis next hour.
[00:30:30.099 --> 00:30:32.660]  Of course, the media tells you everything's fine.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.161]  I want to bring Jason Bermas up now.
[00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:42.258]  I want to cover this first and then get into how you knew Jennings and what he said to you in private and what's in Fabled Enemies.
[00:30:42.278 --> 00:30:46.822]  Thank God we have this to discredit and expose the BBC so this dead man can tell tales.
[00:30:47.782 --> 00:30:53.426]  But first off, I'm worried about Dylan and I won't talk bad about my friends until they're in danger.
[00:30:54.407 --> 00:30:58.590]  And I give people advice and they seem to think I just fell off a turnip truck or something.
[00:30:59.211 --> 00:31:03.434]  My listeners and us together are leading the true revolution against tyranny.
[00:31:04.318 --> 00:31:06.779]  Doesn't mean we're doing the best job either, but we're the best there is.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.240]  No brag, just fact.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.981]  In fact, that's a dangerous mantle.
[00:31:10.141 --> 00:31:12.222]  It's dangerous to be on the front lines wearing a general hat.
[00:31:12.842 --> 00:31:13.062]  Okay?
[00:31:13.082 --> 00:31:14.283]  In fact, I try to play that down.
[00:31:14.883 --> 00:31:21.286]  But the bottom line is, Dylan Avery had more discussions with Jennings about... I remember Dylan telling me,
[00:31:22.984 --> 00:31:25.927]  Threats against his pension, threats against his job, and more.
[00:31:26.167 --> 00:31:29.870]  That he was worried about his family, and that he said more, but Dylan wouldn't say, because it was off the record.
[00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.971]  Well, he's dead now!
[00:31:31.611 --> 00:31:33.012]  And Dylan's all freaked out.
[00:31:33.032 --> 00:31:34.254]  Hey, Dylan, let me tell you how this works.
[00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:38.397]  If they think you know something, you're not safe until you let that out.
[00:31:38.577 --> 00:31:43.621]  Look at the hundreds killed, the news about the Kennedy assassination, and then their family members they told stuff got killed.
[00:31:44.382 --> 00:31:45.143]  This isn't a joke!
[00:31:46.229 --> 00:31:48.614]  So Dylan, you better... I told the D.C.
[00:31:48.634 --> 00:31:49.135]  Madam this!
[00:31:49.355 --> 00:31:50.036]  She's dead!
[00:31:50.337 --> 00:31:51.178]  She didn't listen!
[00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:53.763]  I said, on air and off air, you better spill the beans!
[00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:59.726]  And man, every time I'd talk to her off air, I'd say, you know, the NSA says, listen, right now, ma'am, you better tell everybody.
[00:31:59.766 --> 00:32:02.629]  And she goes, well, I just... And she'd say, look, they can just leave me alone.
[00:32:02.689 --> 00:32:03.469]  I just want to retire.
[00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.391]  Just drop the prosecution.
[00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:07.032]  I never gave up my client list.
[00:32:07.513 --> 00:32:09.795]  And yes, of course, it went up to people in the White House.
[00:32:10.095 --> 00:32:10.775]  That's all I'm going to say.
[00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:11.776]  And I said, they're going to kill you!
[00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:14.859]  She said, no, no, I just want this to go away.
[00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:17.921]  She thought she'd be safe if she shut up.
[00:32:18.222 --> 00:32:19.423]  They killed her deader than a hammer!
[00:32:20.342 --> 00:32:22.403]  She told me if she was killed, it would be murder.
[00:32:22.543 --> 00:32:24.244]  She told her lawyer, have an autopsy.
[00:32:24.364 --> 00:32:25.845]  But lawyers came and blocked that.
[00:32:26.485 --> 00:32:27.906]  She said, if I'm killed, I'll be murdered.
[00:32:28.066 --> 00:32:29.947]  She told the condo manager, her friend, that.
[00:32:30.127 --> 00:32:31.147]  We had him on!
[00:32:32.168 --> 00:32:33.428]  Now listen, Dylan Avery.
[00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:37.530]  They know you talked to Jennings.
[00:32:38.451 --> 00:32:44.113]  Now, you better go on this show or another show, or you better write it up on your blog or do a video blog right now.
[00:32:44.614 --> 00:32:46.254]  I know you've never taken any of my advice.
[00:32:47.355 --> 00:32:48.996]  But the point is, you better take it now.
[00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:55.253]  I'm going to go to, uh, when people's lives are in the balance, I'm just not going to be nice about it anymore.
[00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:57.035]  I was too nice to the D.C.
[00:32:57.075 --> 00:32:57.635]  Madam about it.
[00:32:58.316 --> 00:32:59.917]  This is common sense stuff!
[00:33:00.718 --> 00:33:03.480]  You know, I read the book written by Jim Garrison, who went through this stuff.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.142]  This isn't a game, people!
[00:33:06.663 --> 00:33:08.624]  These people run child kidnapping rings!
[00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:09.886]  They kill children!
[00:33:10.026 --> 00:33:10.766]  They don't care!
[00:33:10.826 --> 00:33:11.367]  They like it!
[00:33:12.691 --> 00:33:16.674]  Well, I'm getting mad because I don't want my friends getting killed out of intimidation.
[00:33:16.714 --> 00:33:18.215]  Dylan is scared to death right now.
[00:33:18.255 --> 00:33:18.915]  He said he is.
[00:33:19.676 --> 00:33:22.718]  And I'm going to bring up Jason Burmiss, who also knew Jennings.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.841]  Burmiss, this is incredible.
[00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:28.342]  What do you say?
[00:33:30.083 --> 00:33:40.650]  Well, just the whole chain of events from Aaron calling me about a week after Jennings had actually died and said, you know, we're getting these emails and there's these posts.
[00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:41.771]  And I said to him, well,
[00:33:42.284 --> 00:33:43.365]  Let me see what I can find out.
[00:33:43.425 --> 00:33:47.488]  So I called up Dylan, and of course, you know, right away, Dylan didn't want to believe it.
[00:33:47.668 --> 00:33:49.670]  But I said, well, who can you get in contact with?
[00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.132]  And wouldn't call him, had the home phone number, and wouldn't give it to us.
[00:33:53.493 --> 00:33:55.614]  He had Jennings' cell at the time.
[00:33:55.674 --> 00:33:57.956]  He didn't have the home phone number, which we got last night.
[00:33:57.996 --> 00:34:00.418]  But he had the cell, and he didn't want to give him a call and be like,
[00:34:01.735 --> 00:34:08.681]  You know, basically he pawned it off on Michael Rudin, who did that BBC hit piece, and this is what really disturbs me.
[00:34:09.061 --> 00:34:13.644]  Now, Rudin probably had more contact information than anybody on Jennings.
[00:34:13.724 --> 00:34:21.270]  He had a sit-down interview with him on the BBC, obviously had his cell number, obviously knew where he worked, and Dylan contacted him that day.
[00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:23.241]  And Rudin said he would look into it.
[00:34:23.622 --> 00:34:30.343]  Now, I was down at Ground Zero on 9-11 and I ran into Dylan and Dylan said, you know, I just ran into Rudin again.
[00:34:30.863 --> 00:34:31.444]  Stay there!
[00:34:31.504 --> 00:34:33.704]  Let's hear this and who this Rudin creature is.
[00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:35.024]  I've debated him.
[00:34:35.084 --> 00:34:37.125]  He's an unbelievably wicked creature.
[00:34:37.165 --> 00:34:37.825]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:37.845 --> 00:34:38.305]  Stay with us.
[00:34:38.325 --> 00:34:46.427]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:34:46.447 --> 00:34:48.248]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:34:51.747 --> 00:34:58.130]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.491]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:35:01.151 --> 00:35:02.171]  But who is the enemy?
[00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:03.232]  Bin Laden.
[00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:04.412]  This is his ammo.
[00:35:04.432 --> 00:35:05.793]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:07.533]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:35:07.854 --> 00:35:14.596]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:35:14.996 --> 00:35:15.437]  Some U.S.
[00:35:15.477 --> 00:35:21.159]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:25.362]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:35.591]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:35:35.812 --> 00:35:36.552]  Fabled enemies.

[00:35:54.179 --> 00:35:56.100]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.482]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:06.025 --> 00:36:06.666]  Big Brother.
[00:36:07.326 --> 00:36:08.387]  Mainstream media.
[00:36:09.087 --> 00:36:10.187]  Government cover-ups.
[00:36:10.848 --> 00:36:11.668]  You want answers?
[00:36:12.429 --> 00:36:14.350]  Well, so does he.
[00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.651]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:18.172 --> 00:36:22.234]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36:23.638 --> 00:36:25.662]  All right, Jason Bernmuth is our guest.
[00:36:26.143 --> 00:36:27.365]  Jason, recap.
[00:36:28.827 --> 00:36:33.335]  Barry Jennings dead, 53, couple days before the NIST whitewash report comes out.
[00:36:33.355 --> 00:36:36.380]  You got this BBC swarming around trying to
[00:36:37.955 --> 00:36:39.955]  Engage in disinfo about Building 7.
[00:36:40.275 --> 00:36:46.257]  They got caught with their pants down pre-reporting Building 7's collapse on two channels live and CNN doing it.
[00:36:46.797 --> 00:36:50.157]  Their disinfo ops tried to say it was fake video, wasn't real, blue screen.
[00:36:50.457 --> 00:36:52.518]  Later they had to admit it was live, it was real.
[00:36:52.938 --> 00:36:54.418]  So just incredible deception.
[00:36:54.818 --> 00:37:00.359]  Their news anchor was interviewed by We Are Change England and said, I didn't work that day, I was at the theater.
[00:37:00.399 --> 00:37:01.120]  And they said, there's video.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.820]  And he said, oh I remember it all now, yes.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.622]  I mean, just incredibly transparent operations.
[00:37:06.723 --> 00:37:07.443]  He's dead.
[00:37:07.904 --> 00:37:08.864]  We've confirmed that.
[00:37:08.904 --> 00:37:11.927]  We're also buying a very expensive data package right now.
[00:37:11.947 --> 00:37:12.727]  You can do that online.
[00:37:13.027 --> 00:37:15.349]  Of all Jennings' info, we know his wife's name, everything right now.
[00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:16.890]  We're getting all that info.
[00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.913]  He is dead, this emergency management deputy head there for the Housing Authority.
[00:37:21.794 --> 00:37:26.578]  And for those that just joined us, we have new lectures every few minutes and other talk shows don't recap.
[00:37:26.958 --> 00:37:30.621]  Recap what happened in your words, Jason, then we'll get into the BBC.
[00:37:32.034 --> 00:37:47.929]  Alright, well, just to start things off, you know, in the making of Loose Change Final Cut, me and Dylan were combing through Loose Change 2nd Edition, and we noticed that two people had said that they were on the 23rd floor, and it only made sense that that would be the Office of Emergency Management.
[00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:56.618]  So, Dylan started looking into Barry Jennings, and because we named Michael Hess right away, and he was the City Corporation Counsel at the time, but
[00:37:57.254 --> 00:37:58.694]  My phone calls were never returned.
[00:37:58.734 --> 00:37:59.835]  My emails were never returned.
[00:37:59.855 --> 00:38:02.015]  I even faxed his office to try to get an interview.
[00:38:02.315 --> 00:38:07.296]  They had no desire to be interviewed about World Trade Center Building 7 and 9-11 that day.
[00:38:08.056 --> 00:38:14.518]  However, Dylan got Barry Jennings' information, and he called up Barry, and we went down there.
[00:38:14.598 --> 00:38:16.518]  That happened a little over a year ago now.
[00:38:17.418 --> 00:38:19.819]  And when we got there, he didn't really know who we were.
[00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:24.040]  We were just kind of talking, you know, lightheartedly, and he's like, you know, I was in one of those 9-11 movies,
[00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.771]  He said, you know, the Michael Myers one.
[00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:28.573]  I go, Michael Moore, Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:38:28.613 --> 00:38:29.774]  He's like, no, not that one.
[00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:31.496]  He's like, uh, you're the conspiracy one.
[00:38:31.516 --> 00:38:32.276]  I said, loose change.
[00:38:32.517 --> 00:38:33.978]  And he said, yeah, it's a really good movie.
[00:38:34.038 --> 00:38:36.040]  And we then explained to him who we were.
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.362]  And we said, you know, we're the guys that made loose change.
[00:38:38.402 --> 00:38:39.303]  And that's why we're here.
[00:38:39.423 --> 00:38:42.666]  We, you know, understand that you experienced explosion on the 23rd floor.
[00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:43.907]  He's like, oh yeah, of course.
[00:38:43.947 --> 00:38:45.148]  You know, that wasn't the only one.
[00:38:45.689 --> 00:38:45.829]  So.
[00:38:46.499 --> 00:38:47.239]  We're in his office.
[00:38:47.279 --> 00:38:48.019]  He finds out who he is.
[00:38:48.039 --> 00:38:49.560]  He's introducing us to other people.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:50.220]  Very friendly.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:50.880]  Very cordial.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:51.940]  Pictures of his family.
[00:38:52.061 --> 00:38:52.781]  Key to the city.
[00:38:52.861 --> 00:38:54.041]  We have that in Fabled Enemies.
[00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:56.142]  He actually had a key to the city from his experience that day.
[00:38:56.422 --> 00:38:59.122]  Probably the most credible eyewitness that we could get.
[00:38:59.583 --> 00:39:05.264]  So we took him out to the pier and all the way over he's telling us the story of the lobby and how there were bodies in the lobby.
[00:39:05.324 --> 00:39:08.825]  Now, we didn't cue that story up and he later told that on camera.
[00:39:08.845 --> 00:39:13.466]  I mean, you can see that we didn't say anything about bodies or try to direct him in any way.
[00:39:13.506 --> 00:39:14.847]  He volunteered that information.
[00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:15.847]  Now,
[00:39:16.934 --> 00:39:19.897]  It really wasn't that information that got him into hot water.
[00:39:19.937 --> 00:39:26.963]  Dylan called him up about two months before the release of the film, and he said, hey, you know, I just want to make sure everything's all right.
[00:39:27.003 --> 00:39:32.528]  He was going to try to go have lunch with him, and he didn't even really know who he was, and he explained himself, and he's like, oh, well, I need to talk to you.
[00:39:33.055 --> 00:39:35.496]  He's like, I'm getting all sorts of phone calls at my job.
[00:39:36.196 --> 00:39:37.216]  My work has been threatened.
[00:39:37.236 --> 00:39:38.456]  My pension has been threatened.
[00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:39.637]  He's like, man, I'm a family man.
[00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:40.937]  That was the first thing I said to you.
[00:39:40.957 --> 00:39:46.918]  You know, he told us straight up that he was two years away from his pension and he couldn't wait to retire and be with his family more often.
[00:39:47.359 --> 00:39:49.659]  And he's like, you know, I need to pull this interview.
[00:39:49.819 --> 00:39:51.380]  He's like, I'm getting all sorts of pressure.
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.621]  You know, so Dylan, you know, being the good person that he is, he said yes, of course.
[00:39:55.701 --> 00:39:57.141]  And he understood completely.
[00:39:57.682 --> 00:40:03.208]  Now, the cards kind of went off the table when we found out that he was going to be doing an interview with the BBC.
[00:40:03.728 --> 00:40:12.658]  Now, the only thing that he seemed to change in his interview, and you watched that interview, it was very well edited, but the only thing he changed was that dead bodies comment.
[00:40:13.018 --> 00:40:15.200]  And I think that that's where the real threats were coming from.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:19.145]  Well, I wouldn't say very well edited, very sneakily, very short, tiny clips.
[00:40:19.926 --> 00:40:24.847]  Yeah, and then, like, of course, when he would talk about explosions, they would talk about how the towers were coming down.
[00:40:25.108 --> 00:40:30.389]  Well, well, well, that's like William Rodriguez is on tape, and now the full video's been released from a side camera.
[00:40:30.649 --> 00:40:33.450]  He's going, yes, I was in the towers, and there were explosions.
[00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:36.751]  And then they cut to a reporter going, after they began falling.
[00:40:36.951 --> 00:40:39.812]  But in the full clip, he goes, 30 minutes before they fell.
[00:40:40.692 --> 00:40:42.033]  You see, so that's how they do it.
[00:40:42.053 --> 00:40:42.653]  They had Barry Jennings.
[00:40:42.693 --> 00:40:43.614]  I was hearing explosions.
[00:40:43.814 --> 00:40:45.976]  They cut to somebody else as the towers fell.
[00:40:46.576 --> 00:40:51.499]  You see, I mean, just when you see that, you're like, oh my God, they're actually engaged in deception here.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.181]  These people making this stuff know they're lying.
[00:40:54.882 --> 00:40:59.305]  I mean, you're dealing with some real villains here.
[00:40:59.785 --> 00:41:00.606]  We'll be right back.
[00:41:00.626 --> 00:41:01.066]  Stay with us.
[00:41:01.947 --> 00:41:03.347]  It is a big idea.
[00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:05.429]  A new world order.
[00:41:06.155 --> 00:41:10.737]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:41:11.038 --> 00:41:13.859]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:41:13.899 --> 00:41:16.140]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:41:16.661 --> 00:41:19.102]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:41:19.862 --> 00:41:27.166]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:41:30.193 --> 00:41:35.175]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:41:35.655 --> 00:41:39.116]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:41:39.516 --> 00:41:42.037]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:41:42.077 --> 00:41:43.238]  Most people have no idea.
[00:41:43.258 --> 00:41:43.998]  They're not after money.
[00:41:44.018 --> 00:41:45.118]  They have all the money they need.
[00:41:45.318 --> 00:41:46.039]  They're after power.
[00:41:46.279 --> 00:41:47.319]  That's what they're after these days.

[00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:18.039]  We're good to go!
[00:42:39.324 --> 00:42:40.465]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[00:42:40.485 --> 00:42:41.286]  Do what I did.
[00:42:41.486 --> 00:42:42.947]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[00:42:43.047 --> 00:42:45.730]  Go to the J. Michael Stephens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:47.652]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.
[00:42:47.712 --> 00:42:49.153]  Put a little security in your life.
[00:42:49.293 --> 00:42:50.374]  You deserve security.
[00:42:50.454 --> 00:42:51.455]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:42:51.475 --> 00:42:51.976]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:42:51.996 --> 00:42:52.076]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:42:52.196 --> 00:42:52.876]  Put some food away.
[00:42:52.896 --> 00:42:53.357]  Do it now.

[00:43:00.805 --> 00:43:03.728]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:43:03.888 --> 00:43:09.132]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:43:09.412 --> 00:43:14.777]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:43:15.137 --> 00:43:16.258]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:43:16.618 --> 00:43:25.486]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:43:25.926 --> 00:43:27.548]  Now, compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[00:43:27.768 --> 00:43:31.933]  All natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:43:54.886 --> 00:43:59.426]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:44:01.827 --> 00:44:07.408]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:44:08.948 --> 00:44:14.552]  All right, Jason Bernis, who's the deputy head of emergency management for the Housing Authority in New York, Barry Jennings.
[00:44:15.512 --> 00:44:18.034]  We talked about explosions, dead bodies.
[00:44:18.074 --> 00:44:19.635]  This is before Tower 1 or 2 fell.
[00:44:21.036 --> 00:44:23.678]  And I interviewed him because he was on the news that day saying,
[00:44:25.091 --> 00:44:26.113]  Everybody forgot about that.
[00:44:26.954 --> 00:44:30.038]  Then we had the firemen, the police, the medics saying, yeah, get back.
[00:44:30.058 --> 00:44:31.380]  The government says they're blowing up building 7.
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.541]  It's all on video.
[00:44:32.962 --> 00:44:34.183]  Larry Silverstein saying it.
[00:44:34.644 --> 00:44:36.667]  It was announced on local radio they were going to blow it up.
[00:44:37.187 --> 00:44:38.850]  BBC said it had already fallen.
[00:44:40.652 --> 00:44:41.133]  CNN.
[00:44:41.153 --> 00:44:42.334]  I mean, they did this, folks.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.121]  And this is a big deal, so they had to kill Jennings.
[00:44:45.922 --> 00:44:48.943]  And he was 53, he could have had a heart attack, maybe 5% chance.
[00:44:49.484 --> 00:44:59.990]  Right around the NIST report coming out, we know that the BBC was trying to interview him again, we know that his boss was now contradicting him, but conveniently he is now gone.
[00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:07.394]  Continue, and I'm going to have Aaron ask you some questions, continue with what we're covering and going over here, Jason Burmess.
[00:45:08.476 --> 00:45:18.395]  Well, before I even get back into that, I'd just like to say, you know, I suspect that they're going to say heart attack, and that's suspicious enough for me, but if the cause of death is anything outside of a heart attack,
[00:45:18.917 --> 00:45:23.521]  Like, you know, a car accident, or a slip and a fall, or something.
[00:45:23.541 --> 00:45:24.722]  That's even more suspicious.
[00:45:24.762 --> 00:45:25.883]  But, continuing.
[00:45:26.484 --> 00:45:27.425]  So he's going to go on this.
[00:45:27.465 --> 00:45:28.025]  That's right.
[00:45:28.105 --> 00:45:30.207]  Nowhere in the newspaper is this cause of death.
[00:45:30.247 --> 00:45:31.188]  We did deep searches.
[00:45:31.889 --> 00:45:33.150]  No one has any details.
[00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.371]  No one knows anything.
[00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:36.132]  His family's being closed-lipped.
[00:45:36.513 --> 00:45:38.655]  His bosses and others are being closed-lipped.
[00:45:38.695 --> 00:45:41.477]  His employees and people that are under him are being closed-lipped.
[00:45:42.358 --> 00:45:44.199]  I mean, we have a right to know.
[00:45:44.239 --> 00:45:45.140]  The fact that it's being...
[00:45:46.641 --> 00:45:57.106]  And so we released our full interview because we wanted people to see exactly what Barry Jennings had said.
[00:46:05.948 --> 00:46:09.170]  Absolutely, and they actually did have at least the courtesy to show that in there.
[00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:19.158]  But I hung out with Rudin, who did this whole piece, for about 35-45 minutes off a camera because he didn't want to interview me because I'm a little bit too much of a bulldog, I guess, for him.
[00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.291]  And we argued up and down.
[00:46:21.371 --> 00:46:26.612]  You know, he was telling me he had special video inside World Trade Center 7 that was going to prove the damage.
[00:46:26.913 --> 00:46:29.894]  And I said, Sir, I have the video inside World Trade Center 7.
[00:46:30.534 --> 00:46:31.814]  It's going to be in my next picture.
[00:46:32.254 --> 00:46:33.975]  And it clearly shows it wasn't scooped out.
[00:46:34.015 --> 00:46:41.258]  And then you watch the program, and they're trying to say that it's scooped out from a picture that one man is holding that they zoom into.
[00:46:41.318 --> 00:46:42.358]  It's not even scanned in.
[00:46:42.418 --> 00:46:43.198]  It's shoddily done.
[00:46:43.438 --> 00:46:45.359]  It doesn't show a quarter of the building scooped out.
[00:46:45.579 --> 00:46:47.100]  You know, NIST had to retract on that.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.442]  That's right, they are showing a gray building, not a red face building.
[00:46:52.942 --> 00:46:55.183]  Clearly the World Financial Center across the street.
[00:46:55.803 --> 00:46:58.425]  Understand, NIST has retracted what BBC said.
[00:46:59.285 --> 00:47:07.909]  Yeah, so I contact Dylan and Dylan contacts this character and he says that he'll get right on it and he'll let Dylan know as soon as he knows something.
[00:47:08.029 --> 00:47:12.411]  So again, me and Dylan meet up on 9-11 in New York City and he says,
[00:47:12.964 --> 00:47:18.347]  Oh, I just happened to cross Michael Rudin, and I asked him about Barry, and he said he still hadn't come up with anything.
[00:47:18.387 --> 00:47:22.990]  Now, this is a BBC journalist, again, who has all of this man's contact information.
[00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:26.792]  Two plus, actually three weeks, almost, after his death.
[00:47:26.812 --> 00:47:27.352]  Yeah, this is huge.
[00:47:27.432 --> 00:47:28.893]  Three weeks after his death.
[00:47:29.654 --> 00:47:30.574]  And he can't confirm it.
[00:47:30.935 --> 00:47:32.075]  However... We've got to call the BBC.
[00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:33.056]  We've got to call this guy.
[00:47:34.136 --> 00:47:46.664]  And then, magically, this same gentleman finds Michael Hess, the only other eyewitness in the building, the head of the City Corporation Council, part of the Office of Emergency Management Program, when a disaster struck.
[00:47:47.084 --> 00:47:53.869]  The other guy that showed up there with Jennings, they showed up separately, and for different purposes, but they went up in that elevator together and were trapped there.
[00:47:54.109 --> 00:48:01.654]  And he is on a separate news network, other than Barry Jennings, and he is saying the same exact thing, that there was a huge explosion
[00:48:02.432 --> 00:48:04.734]  in the building as they tried to evacuate.
[00:48:04.774 --> 00:48:05.574]  Stop right there!
[00:48:05.614 --> 00:48:06.255]  Stop right there!
[00:48:07.236 --> 00:48:10.758]  We are not going to glaze over the huge thing you just pointed out.
[00:48:11.359 --> 00:48:19.665]  You have this BBC reporter, if you can call him that, and he comes climbing around saying Jennings didn't say this.
[00:48:19.925 --> 00:48:23.768]  Doesn't matter that Jennings is on tape saying it on TV news from the day of 9-11.
[00:48:24.529 --> 00:48:28.872]  They're acting like we're just making this up when he's already made the statements on national and local TV.
[00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:30.633]  Then,
[00:48:31.894 --> 00:48:37.937]  Two and a half weeks after he's been contacted, and we need his number right now, we need to contact him, so get that for me Burmese police.
[00:48:39.698 --> 00:48:47.342]  He sees Dylan at 9-11 last week in New York and says, oh I haven't nailed that down, I don't know if he's dead or not.
[00:48:47.723 --> 00:48:51.645]  Now that right there, he needs to be interrogated on that subject.
[00:48:51.665 --> 00:48:53.426]  Boy, I tell you, this is amazing.
[00:48:54.164 --> 00:49:07.272]  Yeah, and then not only does he not know if he's dead, but he finds the only other witness in World Trade Center 7, and he's more than happy to go along with the official version that he now says there was no explosion, it was just dust coming up the stairs.
[00:49:07.492 --> 00:49:07.772]  Really?
[00:49:08.032 --> 00:49:12.195]  Dust coming up the stairs trapped you in the building for another two hours, Mr. Hess?
[00:49:12.395 --> 00:49:17.498]  Did it have anything to do with the fact that he heads up Giuliani Partners in the private sector?
[00:49:17.698 --> 00:49:21.861]  And he retracted conveniently after Mary Jennings went bye-bye.
[00:49:22.768 --> 00:49:24.248]  Yeah, yeah, just magically.
[00:49:24.688 --> 00:49:28.469]  And so, you know, I mean, we're almost at the end of the month now, Alex.
[00:49:28.529 --> 00:49:29.649]  It's September 19th.
[00:49:30.229 --> 00:49:31.970]  Michael Rudin never contacted us.
[00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:40.551]  So, you know, I got on the phone with Aaron last night, and Aaron was great enough to dig up the information, call up the Housing Authority, and finally confirm it.
[00:49:40.631 --> 00:49:51.273]  When he did that, I contacted Dylan, and Dylan looked around for his cell number, couldn't find that, but then actually contacted another 9-11 Truth activist and was able to get his home number.
[00:49:51.698 --> 00:49:52.018]  And you know
[00:50:05.149 --> 00:50:06.629]  I can understand that for him.
[00:50:06.689 --> 00:50:09.510]  This is a kid that just wants to be a director.
[00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:10.730]  I wish he was more vocal as well.
[00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:11.611]  He wanted to reiterate to me.
[00:50:11.631 --> 00:50:12.231]  He said to me again,
[00:50:30.202 --> 00:50:32.243]  You know, there had nothing to do with the bodies.
[00:50:32.283 --> 00:50:34.625]  He said, you know, that he was getting threats at work.
[00:50:34.925 --> 00:50:36.947]  That was his initial conversation with Barry.
[00:50:37.407 --> 00:50:39.408]  You know, he said Barry really wasn't upset at him.
[00:50:39.468 --> 00:50:41.029]  He was just upset about what had happened.
[00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:48.074]  And he said he thought that we had given away where he worked when, you know, that was one of the things that we, we covered up very well in our interview.
[00:50:48.114 --> 00:50:52.857]  We just said that he, you know, worked for the city, uh, housing department, not where, not what he was doing there.
[00:50:53.558 --> 00:50:53.958]  And, uh,
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:59.266]  You know, it's very unnerving for him because, again, he never thought that this would be a reality.
[00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:00.447]  Well, let's just move on then.
[00:51:00.467 --> 00:51:02.749]  That's where he wants to do.
[00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:03.490]  That's good for him.
[00:51:03.991 --> 00:51:12.861]  I'm just saying it's also kind of unnerving for me that if this man was murdered that there's a possibility that I may have something to do with that because we did seek him out.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.062]  And it sucks that the truth can bring that.
[00:51:15.842 --> 00:51:19.706]  But we tried our best to make this as public as possible, as soon as possible.
[00:51:20.046 --> 00:51:24.870]  And like you said, Alex, some people just aren't willing to go that route, and it can have disastrous effects.
[00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.811]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:51:26.552 --> 00:51:33.698]  The elite are psychopaths and have no conscience, and then good people invent reasons not to do the right thing through cowardice.
[00:51:34.598 --> 00:51:36.360]  And we are not engaging in cowardice.
[00:51:37.181 --> 00:51:40.424]  The Monday morning quarterbacks can second-guess us all day.
[00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:48.690]  People can sit up in the peanut gallery and talk bad about 9-11 Truth, but we are a movement making history, and we didn't commit those murders.
[00:51:49.150 --> 00:52:09.225]  We have exposed those murders, and if in the expose of 3,000 murders, the enemy murders some more people, that is on their hands, and any asinine extrapolation or mental gymnastics, that it's our fault is just that, the product of a diseased, modern, decadent mind.
[00:52:09.705 --> 00:52:15.049]  But I want to tell everybody out there who knows information about Inside Job, police officers, firefighters, others.
[00:52:15.529 --> 00:52:18.592]  They killed hundreds to cover up the JFK murder.
[00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:20.833]  They've already killed hundreds to cover up this one.
[00:52:21.134 --> 00:52:22.314]  They will kill hundreds more.
[00:52:22.895 --> 00:52:28.359]  You are safe, as history has shown us, when you dump it all out and have nothing else to tell.
[00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:33.423]  Then if they kill you, it makes everybody come and look at what you've said and what you've done.
[00:52:34.986 --> 00:52:41.170]  And so, that's my bottom line here, is that 9-11 truth, by every yardstick, is bigger than it's ever been.
[00:52:41.751 --> 00:52:43.312]  And people say, well, it's about seven years ago.
[00:52:43.412 --> 00:53:00.243]  No, it's about the whole agenda of the police state, and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and now they want Iran, and sneak attacks on Russian-held areas by the globalists and NATO, and the domestic police state, and the Patriot Act, and the end of our Bill of Rights and Constitution, and the federalization of our police.
[00:53:00.563 --> 00:53:04.786]  And I've got articles today about how they're putting up sonar cameras on the streets that look through your clothes now.
[00:53:05.186 --> 00:53:06.227]  Same stuff in the airports.
[00:53:07.567 --> 00:53:08.187]  It's happening!
[00:53:08.528 --> 00:53:21.153]  This is the military-industrial complex, full-spectrum dominance, continuity of government taking over, and I tell you, every one of their spooks who claims they're 9-11 Truth, writing hit pieces about 9-11 Truth, are all former military.
[00:53:21.253 --> 00:53:26.295]  These bastards think they owe their allegiance to this criminal government that's hijacked our military.
[00:53:26.615 --> 00:53:28.076]  They don't think we don't see right through them.
[00:53:28.416 --> 00:53:29.296]  This is incredible!
[00:53:29.737 --> 00:53:32.178]  Anybody saying 9-11 Truth's dead is a liar.
[00:53:33.178 --> 00:53:35.120]  Well, I'd have to agree with you, you know.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:39.464]  I mean, last week again, the night before 9-11, it was standing room only at Fabled Enemy's premiere.
[00:53:56.338 --> 00:53:58.500]  And, you know, there was over 200 people there.
[00:53:58.921 --> 00:54:03.425]  I was shocked to see how many people actually came out to the city as the day went on.
[00:54:03.485 --> 00:54:08.089]  I mean, literally, you know, wrapped around the corners again as they did their march.
[00:54:08.689 --> 00:54:10.831]  And, yeah, I was... I mean, I was watching videos of that.
[00:54:10.871 --> 00:54:12.353]  It was thousands and thousands of people.
[00:54:12.453 --> 00:54:15.055]  Everybody says it was more in the march than it's ever been.
[00:54:16.496 --> 00:54:17.497]  It was a very big march.
[00:54:17.517 --> 00:54:20.440]  I was very surprised as I saw that take place.
[00:54:21.019 --> 00:54:24.301]  And saw people grouping together from... because it was really hard to get together.
[00:54:24.341 --> 00:54:26.803]  I mean, the entire front is now blocked off, Alex.
[00:54:27.384 --> 00:54:28.825]  The sides are pretty much blocked off.
[00:54:28.885 --> 00:54:35.129]  Really, the only place where you can congregate is towards the back of... But that's not even the issue, Jason.
[00:54:35.149 --> 00:54:49.179]  What I'm saying is, there's a concerted effort with the same script being put out by hundreds of people saying 9-11 Truth is dead, right as presidents and leaders and former defense chiefs go public.
[00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:56.844]  Rightist governors, and Hollywood people, and the best actress, and Willie Nelson, and George Carlin, all these people are going public.
[00:54:57.184 --> 00:55:02.387]  And Bruce Willis comes out and says the same people that killed Kennedy are the ones running things now and staging the terror.
[00:55:02.647 --> 00:55:05.049]  We tell you that three months before it comes out in the news.
[00:55:05.469 --> 00:55:07.110]  Michelle Malkin says I'm a liar.
[00:55:07.991 --> 00:55:09.031]  She won't give her source.
[00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:11.053]  And then he tells Vanity Fair, yes.
[00:55:11.673 --> 00:55:13.934]  I mean, the point is, we are winning.
[00:55:14.495 --> 00:55:15.896]  We are waking people up.
[00:55:17.767 --> 00:55:18.828]  And so that's my point!
[00:55:19.208 --> 00:55:20.709]  And I'm not going to let these... Stop!
[00:55:20.849 --> 00:55:21.049]  Stop!
[00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.730]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:22.250]  We're coming back.
[00:55:22.731 --> 00:55:31.358]  I'm not going to let these bastards sit here and take this movement that is kicking the new old owners butt, taking their favorite tool of government-sponsored terrorism...
[00:55:33.243 --> 00:55:37.804]  I mean, introducing the public's mind to somebody else may have staged this.
[00:55:38.064 --> 00:55:39.584]  Who really stands to gain from this?
[00:55:40.144 --> 00:55:41.164]  Changing history.
[00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:49.406]  All our work, all our success, and we see them running a black op on us, and it's disgusting to know there's that many feds in our movement.
[00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:50.986]  We are kicking their butt.
[00:55:51.346 --> 00:55:51.646]  Stay there.
[00:55:51.666 --> 00:55:55.407]  We're going to talk behind the scenes for InfoWars.com, Streamlisters, and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:55:55.447 --> 00:55:56.607]  Everybody else will be right back.
[00:55:56.867 --> 00:55:59.708]  Websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:55:59.908 --> 00:56:00.368]  Stay with us.
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:07.744]  Okay, Barnabas, let's get back to the issue of Barry Jennings.
[00:56:07.904 --> 00:56:11.327]  I mean, look, really a lot of evidence.
[00:56:11.627 --> 00:56:13.388]  I mean, this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:56:13.688 --> 00:56:22.135]  We're doing a PI run on all this info that we'll have in the next hour or so, but I want to get your comments with Jason Aaron.
[00:56:22.677 --> 00:56:23.158]  That's right.
[00:56:23.638 --> 00:56:28.563]  Jason, the first big question we have to address is where is his obituary?
[00:56:28.643 --> 00:56:30.665]  I've done searches for hours online.
[00:56:30.725 --> 00:56:31.826]  It's nowhere to be found.
[00:56:32.307 --> 00:56:35.450]  If he has an obituary printed, I can't find it.
[00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:42.077]  Others have found other people named Barry Jennings in an obituary who died sometime in the last month.
[00:56:44.306 --> 00:56:55.615]  But we need to find out what his official cause of death is, when he officially died, because the people I spoke to at the housing authority have soap in their mouth, or something stuck in their mouth, and they're hemming and hawing.
[00:56:56.276 --> 00:56:58.158]  They all admit they knew who Barry was.
[00:56:58.218 --> 00:57:05.464]  They know that he's dead, but they won't say anything else about it, other than to contact the family, who have thus far not answered the phone.
[00:57:06.104 --> 00:57:10.588]  We don't know anything about their circumstances right now, and there's a lot of questions we need to find out.
[00:57:10.708 --> 00:57:13.390]  Well here's a commenter on InfoWars.com on the story.
[00:57:13.711 --> 00:57:15.753]  I wonder what he knew that he hadn't disclosed yet.
[00:57:15.833 --> 00:57:20.777]  Perhaps they knew he knew more than and wanted to shut him up before he revealed more information.
[00:57:21.218 --> 00:57:23.580]  And perhaps they wanted to send a message to others to stay quiet.
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.483]  I have a hunch he didn't just die for natural causes.
[00:57:27.203 --> 00:57:31.504]  In this day and age, energy weapons exist that can give you cancer if they want to.
[00:57:31.904 --> 00:57:35.225]  Even the victim will think he or she is dying from a natural cause.
[00:57:35.245 --> 00:57:37.246]  And that's what they admit they've got, Bob Woodward.
[00:57:38.346 --> 00:57:41.087]  Then again, maybe he did die from a natural cause.
[00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:44.347]  After all, look at all the other coincidences of 9-11.
[00:57:44.667 --> 00:57:46.648]  And that's the whole point here.
[00:57:47.228 --> 00:57:50.289]  It's the cover-up of how he died that adds all this weight to it.
[00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.609]  Bernus?
[00:57:51.852 --> 00:57:52.633]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:52.673 --> 00:58:08.587]  The timing, the cover-up, the fact that the only eyewitness comes out to the only reporter that's able to get an interview with Mr. Jennings to put on stream television days after, you know, well weeks after his death and no longer be contradicted right after the NIST report comes out.
[00:58:08.887 --> 00:58:11.089]  Yeah, I mean it's absolutely absurd and
[00:58:11.499 --> 00:58:26.802]  You know, like you were discussing before of how 9-11 exploding, I mean, Rosie O'Donnell did on the front page of her blog for 9-11 a nine-minute speech with Willie Rodriguez and their testimony, Willie Rodriguez's and Barry Jennings' of explosions inside the buildings.
[00:58:27.556 --> 00:58:31.257]  They corroborate each other, that explosives were planted in one, two, and three.
[00:58:31.277 --> 00:58:38.579]  And then Rodriguez has all these other firefighters and police and other witnesses that he was there getting them out of the building, like he always said.
[00:58:38.619 --> 00:58:40.600]  And what does the bastard controlled corporate media do?
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.760]  They say he's a liar.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.361]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:58:44.901 --> 00:58:48.982]  But just like Barry Jennings, there's news clubs from that day of the same story.
[00:58:49.382 --> 00:58:51.203]  Neither of them ever changed a word.
[00:58:51.303 --> 00:58:52.463]  They're the same.
[00:58:52.703 --> 00:58:54.223]  But Willie Rodriguez went public.
[00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.484]  And now the story is known to more people.
[00:58:57.324 --> 00:59:05.486]  If you check out Fabled Enemies and the Extras, we actually have a full interview with Anthony Santolamacia, who was Willie Rodriguez's supervisor.
[00:59:05.926 --> 00:59:08.527]  And he tells the same exact story as Rodriguez.
[00:59:08.907 --> 00:59:11.647]  Explosions underneath them prior to the plane strike.
[00:59:11.928 --> 00:59:13.928]  You know, that didn't happen until a moment later.
[00:59:14.428 --> 00:59:18.209]  And, you know, this is a guy that would be willing to go in front of a grand jury as well.
[00:59:18.269 --> 00:59:22.290]  I mean, again, Alex, there are more survivors than ever that are coming out and telling their stories.
[00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:26.211]  There are more people interested in 9-11 truth than ever across the country.
[00:59:26.651 --> 00:59:31.694]  If you go on YouTube, I literally handed out a hundred DVDs in less than three minutes.
[00:59:31.714 --> 00:59:38.138]  And by the way, just the action of taking action sets the precedent to resist tyranny.
[00:59:38.198 --> 00:59:43.401]  Just getting involved and then to see the enemy operations saying, making copies of DVDs does nothing.
[00:59:43.681 --> 00:59:46.884]  Marching does nothing, taking over TV, live TV does nothing.
[00:59:47.164 --> 00:59:48.945]  You're making us look bad getting involved.
[00:59:49.166 --> 00:59:50.246]  What did the founding fathers do?
[00:59:50.266 --> 00:59:52.588]  They tarred and feathered and hung people and burned things down.
[00:59:52.869 --> 00:59:53.769]  We're not doing that.
[00:59:54.030 --> 01:00:02.777]  So these people claiming it's un-American to go bullhorn live media that's covering up the truth, they are un-American, they are feds, and they will be exposed.
[01:00:03.157 --> 01:00:04.098]  All of that trash.
[01:00:04.538 --> 01:00:05.159]  Unbelievable!
[01:00:05.319 --> 01:00:06.540]  We're going back live right now.
[01:00:11.633 --> 01:00:13.534]  They're scared to death of you taking over live media.
[01:00:13.594 --> 01:00:15.055]  They're scared to death of you getting out in the streets.
[01:00:15.075 --> 01:00:19.878]  They're scared to death of you starting blogs, calling into talk shows, making your own 9-11 truth videos.
[01:00:20.778 --> 01:00:22.059]  They need false flag terror.
[01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:24.700]  They need to be able to blow stuff up and get everybody to cower and love them.
[01:00:25.161 --> 01:00:27.262]  We're taking one of their favorite tools and exposing it!
[01:00:29.474 --> 01:00:31.835]  Everything we've warned people about is coming out in the mainstream news.
[01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:35.376]  The drugs they put in the water, it levels higher than it could just be from sewage.
[01:00:36.097 --> 01:00:36.877]  How they poison us.
[01:00:36.897 --> 01:00:38.398]  The chemtrails are now declassified.
[01:00:38.418 --> 01:00:39.238]  They are spraying us.
[01:00:39.278 --> 01:00:40.018]  Mainstream news.
[01:00:40.879 --> 01:00:44.920]  We told you what happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac eight years, nine years ago.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:45.600]  It's all happening.
[01:00:46.141 --> 01:00:47.501]  We have the credibility.
[01:00:47.581 --> 01:00:48.722]  We know what's going on.
[01:00:49.622 --> 01:00:51.744]  And the establishment is panicking.
[01:00:52.144 --> 01:00:53.125]  The people are waking up.
[01:00:53.165 --> 01:00:54.265]  We can win this fight.
[01:00:54.706 --> 01:00:58.268]  Half a battle is realizing you can win, you can fight, and showing up for the fight.
[01:00:58.769 --> 01:01:00.870]  They're telling you, hey, there's no fight going on.
[01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.872]  There is a fight going on, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:01:03.892 --> 01:01:06.795]  I'm going to get into economic news, attacks on the First Amendment.
[01:01:06.815 --> 01:01:08.436]  That's why they're trying to restrict us.
[01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:11.938]  Now they're coming out all over the place trying to attack free speech in the U.S.
[01:01:12.279 --> 01:01:16.542]  because they can't win if we have our free speech, because we do have power.
[01:01:17.622 --> 01:01:23.213]  For those who don't know, recapping from your perspective, what's going on with this Barry Jennings case?
[01:01:23.253 --> 01:01:23.774]  Who was he?
[01:01:23.815 --> 01:01:24.436]  What's developed?
[01:01:24.456 --> 01:01:25.217]  What are we looking into?
[01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:37.115]  Well, Barry Jennings, of course, heard explosions, and that opens up a whole basket of questions about Building 7 that were certainly never on the table, since no one ever heard of this building anyway.
[01:01:37.555 --> 01:01:41.758]  And what really brought down that building, Barry Jennings himself volunteered.
[01:01:41.778 --> 01:01:46.301]  He didn't just answer to questions when Jason Burmiss and Dylan spoke to him.
[01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:48.923]  He volunteered that he was an old boiler guy.
[01:01:49.343 --> 01:01:53.406]  He didn't believe the official story on Building 7 was whatsoever possible.
[01:01:53.886 --> 01:02:05.096]  Not only because he heard explosions and reiterated he knew what he heard, he knows what explosions sound like, but he also knew that an oil field tank couldn't bring the building down in a symmetrical collapse.
[01:02:05.476 --> 01:02:14.844]  He knew those questions were outstanding, and yet when they portrayed him on the BBC, which was really the first time he was known to a mass audience, they twisted his words.
[01:02:15.205 --> 01:02:21.110]  What I want people to know is that on your DVD, Jason Burma's Fabled Enemies, that's where you can watch the entire
[01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:24.151]  Unedited Barry Jennings interview that no one's ever seen.
[01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:28.533]  Those are his words, and you can see what he volunteered and also the questions he answered.
[01:02:29.293 --> 01:02:35.856]  Well, I mean, make no mistake, and I'm not asking for people's sympathy or anything, but my God, folks, you've got all these cowardly feds.
[01:02:36.903 --> 01:02:51.554]  out there saying we don't have courage in 9-11 truth to go out and stand at 9-11 events and say it's an inside job or take over TV live shows and be beat up and attack and have knife wielding people cut up our equipment and they tell us we don't have courage or that we're bad or we're maniacs.
[01:02:52.034 --> 01:02:55.237]  They're scared of you not being gelded or neutered.
[01:02:55.637 --> 01:02:57.138]  They're scared of you taking action.
[01:02:57.158 --> 01:02:59.280]  They're scared of that American spirit
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:00.620]  Shining.
[01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:01.961]  And expanding.
[01:03:02.722 --> 01:03:05.623]  And I'm telling you, you know, we do get death threats, folks.
[01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:06.884]  I have been physically attacked.
[01:03:06.904 --> 01:03:08.105]  I've had all kinds of crap happen.
[01:03:09.005 --> 01:03:17.290]  And, you know, I do this because I know, I believe in a higher power, and I know evil's got to be confronted, or it always takes over, and like cancer, and kills societies.
[01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:18.491]  And look around you.
[01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:19.511]  You know evil's growing.
[01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:20.752]  You know things are out of control.
[01:03:21.433 --> 01:03:22.773]  And I just want to commend all of 9-11 Truth.
[01:03:24.389 --> 01:03:30.368]  And my crew and everybody who puts up with all the stuff we put up with for, you know,
[01:03:32.227 --> 01:03:34.748]  I hear you, but I'm just going to keep pushing forward, Alex.
[01:04:01.553 --> 01:04:02.073]  We have to.
[01:04:02.113 --> 01:04:02.874]  We have no choice.
[01:04:02.914 --> 01:04:08.498]  You know, this is a very unfortunate event, but hopefully we can use this event to wake up even more people to 9-11 truth.
[01:04:08.619 --> 01:04:10.060]  Well, we've passed the point of no return.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.522]  And we don't have a choice.
[01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:14.443]  I mean, we are committed to this fight.
[01:04:15.364 --> 01:04:19.607]  We are committed to this, and it's a good feeling to be committed and know there's no turning back.
[01:04:20.168 --> 01:04:23.070]  Plus, we now see where the new order ends.
[01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.810]  Bankruptcy.
[01:04:24.311 --> 01:04:24.851]  Depression.
[01:04:24.911 --> 01:04:25.732]  Being peons.
[01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:26.613]  Having no wealth.
[01:04:27.053 --> 01:04:27.894]  Being slaves.
[01:04:28.034 --> 01:04:29.275]  Living in a total control grid.
[01:04:30.015 --> 01:04:33.678]  Uh, where your every move is watched and controlled with all these new social service police.
[01:04:33.939 --> 01:04:38.622]  I mean, I've got articles here today about them going into schools unannounced and saying, we're militia, gonna kill you.
[01:04:38.983 --> 01:04:40.364]  Teachers having heart attacks.
[01:04:40.724 --> 01:04:42.185]  And the cops just say, we're gonna do it again.
[01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:43.486]  We're gonna unannounced do this.
[01:04:43.787 --> 01:04:44.667]  It's mind control.
[01:04:45.128 --> 01:04:49.552]  And adults at major parks being told you're not allowed to be there because you might be a pedophile.
[01:04:49.792 --> 01:04:51.253]  Meanwhile, the government are the pedophiles.
[01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:56.577]  Uh, you know, I mean, they're just getting in our lives, getting in our business, totally doing things they shouldn't be doing.
[01:04:56.637 --> 01:04:57.618]  It's out of control.
[01:04:57.638 --> 01:04:57.939]  Aaron?
[01:04:58.925 --> 01:05:09.327]  Yeah, I mean, once you realize you've been trapped in a world of watching TV and not knowing anything about the world around you, once you realize any part of the truth, how can you not want to pursue it?
[01:05:09.527 --> 01:05:11.808]  And, I mean, what have you got to lose at that point?
[01:05:11.828 --> 01:05:20.229]  You've got only the whole world to gain in terms of knowing what's really going on, and 9-11 Truth is just an emblematic case of that.
[01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:23.670]  Well, you knew in your gut, you said two weeks ago, he's dead.
[01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:24.990]  And I said, no, no, it's probably a hoax.
[01:05:25.551 --> 01:05:27.111]  And then, I know in my gut, they killed him.
[01:05:27.711 --> 01:05:30.354]  I mean, you know, I have no doubt they killed Barry Jennings.
[01:05:31.075 --> 01:05:34.878]  And as the commenter said on InfoWars, he may not even know that.
[01:05:35.459 --> 01:05:37.361]  He may not, you know, the way they kill you now.
[01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:39.062]  They kill you with fast-acting cancers.
[01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:41.925]  They just microwave gun you out of the back of a van.
[01:05:41.945 --> 01:05:42.826]  You kind of feel weird.
[01:05:42.846 --> 01:05:43.687]  You die a week later.
[01:05:43.707 --> 01:05:45.309]  It's just incredible.
[01:05:45.329 --> 01:05:48.212]  We're going to say bye to Burmese behind the scenes on the InfoWars streams.
[01:05:48.452 --> 01:05:49.393]  We'll be back for everybody else.
[01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:52.843]  Okay, Jason.
[01:05:52.883 --> 01:05:56.265]  Well, Fabled Enemies, of course, the DVD's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.606]  I hope folks will get that.
[01:05:57.646 --> 01:05:58.487]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:05:59.608 --> 01:06:08.375]  No, I'd just like to say that, you know, there is no more timely a time to get this film, make copies of it, hand it out to your friends, or if you don't even want to sit down and watch the entire film with them.
[01:06:08.872 --> 01:06:10.353]  Show this interview to people.
[01:06:10.393 --> 01:06:11.733]  It's an extra on the DVD.
[01:06:11.793 --> 01:06:12.673]  It needs to be seen.
[01:06:12.954 --> 01:06:15.354]  It's there for PrisonPlanet.TV subscribers.
[01:06:15.414 --> 01:06:16.175]  It's on YouTube.
[01:06:16.455 --> 01:06:22.977]  We need to make it go viral yet again and say, look, this guy has died under suspicious circumstances at a suspicious time.
[01:06:23.017 --> 01:06:24.898]  We can't find an obituary.
[01:06:24.958 --> 01:06:26.178]  We need to make this public.
[01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:28.239]  We need to make Building 7 an issue again.
[01:06:28.259 --> 01:06:34.121]  Alright, we're going to come back and we're going to play your
[01:06:36.963 --> 01:06:45.025]  Talk about a month ago, a little more than a month ago, right before he was killed, right before he died mysteriously under probable murder circumstances.
[01:06:45.685 --> 01:06:47.226]  I'm going to play that 7-minute clip.
[01:06:47.326 --> 01:06:53.387]  When we get back, the audio of that, the video is in the story that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:06:53.447 --> 01:06:57.508]  It's in those moving boxes at the top of the Feather 6 story up there from yesterday.
[01:06:57.828 --> 01:06:59.709]  Key witness of WTC explosions dead.
[01:07:00.726 --> 01:07:01.467]  At 53.
[01:07:01.988 --> 01:07:03.349]  So that is coming up.
[01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:07.033]  I'm going to throw this back into break and take a two-minute break and then we'll be right back.
[01:07:07.053 --> 01:07:07.894]  Thanks, Jason Burmas.
[01:07:08.555 --> 01:07:08.875]  Thank you.
[01:07:09.296 --> 01:07:09.857]  You know what, Aaron?
[01:07:09.877 --> 01:07:10.677]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:07:12.328 --> 01:07:17.491]  Not really, only that when you look at one individual under a microscope, you can wonder if it's suspicious or not.
[01:07:17.811 --> 01:07:19.572]  But when you look at the big picture, it's clear.
[01:07:19.592 --> 01:07:22.634]  It happened over and over, as you said, in the JFK case.
[01:07:23.154 --> 01:07:26.656]  And if this is a suspicious death, we have to get to the bottom of it.
[01:07:26.936 --> 01:07:32.119]  We have to find out the truth, and we have to honor his death, if indeed he was killed.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.240]  We have to honor it.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:33.920]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.341]  We have 3,000 people that were murdered.
[01:07:35.361 --> 01:07:39.904]  I assure you, if we could talk to them right now, every one of them would say, absolutely, find out who did this.
[01:07:40.664 --> 01:07:45.729]  And the majority of the victims' families have said on record, and the heads of the biggest groups have said, the most of us believe it's an inside job.
[01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:46.390]  That was years ago.
[01:07:46.991 --> 01:07:51.996]  And we got polls years ago where 84% believe the government's lying, 57% believe total inside job.
[01:07:53.097 --> 01:07:55.099]  And you know, that's the majority of the polls.
[01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:58.082]  They've got a few cooked ones where only half believe they're being lied to.
[01:07:58.682 --> 01:08:01.263]  You know, we're the majority, and that's what 9-11 Truth did.
[01:08:01.583 --> 01:08:10.648]  We went, and it was the first time a major hoax was exposed in a matter of months, instead of a matter of 20-30 years, like JFK.
[01:08:10.668 --> 01:08:18.391]  And we taught people how to culture jam, how to take over live media events, how to be active, how to break people out of their trance watching TV, to take over events.
[01:08:18.751 --> 01:08:19.992]  I mean, it's just revolutionary.
[01:08:20.032 --> 01:08:20.552]  It's beautiful.
[01:08:20.592 --> 01:08:21.192]  It's gorgeous.
[01:08:21.753 --> 01:08:22.313]  And you know what?
[01:08:22.913 --> 01:08:26.274]  You dirty, low-down feds, we're not going to stop, and you can't stop us.
[01:08:26.294 --> 01:08:35.677]  And I know you've committed crimes, and you rationalize the crimes you've committed, and you think it's a cute thing you've done, a funny thing you've done, but you can smell defeat, can't you?
[01:08:35.757 --> 01:08:36.478]  I smell victory.
[01:08:36.858 --> 01:08:38.358]  So we're going to come back live in just a moment.
[01:08:38.398 --> 01:08:38.718]  Thank you.
[01:08:38.758 --> 01:08:41.019]  Oh, and you're going to go update this with all the new developments.
[01:08:41.039 --> 01:08:50.702]  We've got a big data packet on Jennings coming in, and it will stay in contact with the family, so watch InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com for big developments on this front.
[01:08:50.762 --> 01:08:52.103]  Thank you, Aaron Dykes.
[01:08:53.674 --> 01:08:55.519]  Okay, take a five second break.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:56.241]  I deserve it.
[01:08:57.766 --> 01:08:58.849]  We'll go live in three seconds.
[01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.984]  I think God my life means something.
[01:09:13.484 --> 01:09:20.189]  I think God that I saw enough growing up and had parents who educated me enough and formed me and raised me up to be able to see how the world really works.
[01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:27.814]  That I'm not one of these poor people who lives in mental and psychological bondage who never really understand the truth around them.
[01:09:28.695 --> 01:09:38.421]  They can never truly grasp the full beauty of the world or nor can they see the true darkness in it as well.
[01:09:39.362 --> 01:09:40.203]  They are blinded.
[01:09:41.357 --> 01:09:42.978]  But it's more than a physical or mental blindness.
[01:09:43.058 --> 01:09:45.260]  It's a deep spiritual blindness.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:53.005]  And I come, as all truth tellers throughout history come, to unlock people's minds.
[01:09:53.145 --> 01:09:58.068]  To simply take the blinders off so they can see for themselves and then they unlock their own minds.
[01:09:59.289 --> 01:10:00.890]  I'll say this again about 9-11 Truth.
[01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:10.196]  I'm so busy doing so many different things, so many different irons in the fire, military movements, police state actions domestically, economic activities.
[01:10:11.437 --> 01:10:24.210]  9-11 information, films I'm making, employees, staff, articles, family, illnesses, things like that, that it takes me a few weeks sometimes to pick up on a pattern.
[01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:29.174]  Even though it's there in plain view, I'm like everybody else, it takes a while for me to see a pattern.
[01:10:30.316 --> 01:10:43.522]  And I just started seeing all these reports about 9-11 Truth's dead, 9-11 Truth's dead, 9-11 Truth's dead, 9-11 Truth's dead, 9-11 Truth's a disgrace, 9-11 Truth's doing a bad job, 9-11 Truth's, you know, just pathetic, it's not good, all from people who claim they're part of it.
[01:10:44.162 --> 01:10:48.884]  And I kept thinking, oh, that person's just an egomaniac because they're not prominent in it, they're attacking.
[01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:54.287]  Then I'd see another totally separate person saying the same thing, and then I'd track them back, and I'm like, wait,
[01:10:56.152 --> 01:11:01.154]  There's like 20 of these people and 18 of them are former Army or Naval Intelligence.
[01:11:01.714 --> 01:11:02.034]  Wow!
[01:11:02.194 --> 01:11:07.096]  And I'd go get data packets and pay money to look into who they are, like we just did on Jennings.
[01:11:08.836 --> 01:11:10.097]  You know, you can buy that stuff.
[01:11:10.657 --> 01:11:11.837]  We just paid $50 for it.
[01:11:11.857 --> 01:11:13.938]  We may pay a couple hundred more to get even more info.
[01:11:14.658 --> 01:11:16.699]  And you go, my God, these people are black ops!
[01:11:17.579 --> 01:11:18.799]  And then you see what they're all saying.
[01:11:18.899 --> 01:11:20.320]  But even if you don't have that data,
[01:11:21.775 --> 01:11:24.397]  You can sit right there and see they're all saying the same thing.
[01:11:24.978 --> 01:11:26.879]  The same catchphrases to get it moving.
[01:11:27.139 --> 01:11:28.220]  Because they're scared to death, man.
[01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:43.033]  Best actress, Willie Nelson, Governor of Ventura, Italian President, highly respected, former Italian intelligence head, high-level Japanese, you know, members of Parliament in Europe, open calls by UN commissions for 9-11 inside job investigations.
[01:11:45.598 --> 01:11:53.989]  Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth getting multiple peer-reviewed and prestigious journals about controlled implosions of Tower 1, 2, and 7.
[01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:57.093]  The NIST report imploding, being discredited.
[01:11:58.183 --> 01:12:09.289]  All these eyewitnesses coming out, all these, you know, Martin Sheen, Amy Goodman, George Carlin, all going public, and then the citizens are only doing a shadow of what the founders did.
[01:12:09.309 --> 01:12:20.535]  The Sons of Liberty from 1760 to 1775, handing out pamphlets, little hand-printed things to get arrested for, burning down police stations, tar and feathering corrupt bureaucrats.
[01:12:20.735 --> 01:12:23.057]  The bureaucrats came and put somebody in the stocks for their speech.
[01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:27.599]  They would just go to the police, the head constable's house and burn it down.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.380]  Now I'm not saying do that.
[01:12:29.801 --> 01:12:33.082]  But you grab the patriot for his free speech, they would go burn you out.
[01:12:33.563 --> 01:12:35.464]  Or they would riot and burn down the city hall.
[01:12:36.204 --> 01:12:41.327]  They would hang up dummies in the streets of who the next public official was, servant they were going to kill.
[01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.009]  Now that's what our founders did.
[01:12:44.349 --> 01:12:45.670]  And we praise them and hail them.
[01:12:47.213 --> 01:12:54.278]  But nowadays you go to an event and you say 9-11 is an inside job so people watching national TV realize they're watching a controlled program.
[01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:55.258]  It makes them think.
[01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:59.541]  Or you put out websites so people can hear it and it's attacked as bad.
[01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:03.044]  And you know it's not good.
[01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:04.245]  You need to stay in your house.
[01:13:04.285 --> 01:13:06.326]  You need to not go out and interface with people.
[01:13:06.366 --> 01:13:13.491]  And 9-11 Truth is called all manner of names.
[01:13:14.827 --> 01:13:18.910]  Let me give you the straight scoop, just like we told you Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were going to plunge.
[01:13:20.031 --> 01:13:24.274]  Just like we told you basically everything else that's happened years before.
[01:13:24.554 --> 01:13:30.138]  Because we have the globalist documents, we know their program, we know what they've done in hundreds of other countries, we know what they say they're doing in this country.
[01:13:33.401 --> 01:13:34.601]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:39.245]  And 9-11 Truth did better than I even thought it probably would.
[01:13:43.015 --> 01:13:50.117]  I knew there was the potential to cause a grassroots movement and a massive epiphany, or a flashpoint, an awakening to inside job false flag.
[01:13:50.497 --> 01:13:52.418]  To have a revelation of that understanding.
[01:13:53.498 --> 01:14:04.021]  To understand that if we exposed problem or action solution, government sponsored terror, their favorite tool, that one of their main weapons would be destroyed.
[01:14:06.854 --> 01:14:13.339]  And I made personal sacrifices two months before to go on air and say they're going to probably blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[01:14:14.319 --> 01:14:16.481]  And they're probably going to launch an anthrax attack.
[01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:19.103]  You know, that's also in that video.
[01:14:19.883 --> 01:14:27.309]  In a two-hour TV show I did and radio shows, because I knew they'd done drills before, and everything they did a drill for, they ended up doing.
[01:14:27.349 --> 01:14:34.154]  I knew they'd done a drill attacking the World Trade Center, just like the FBI did attack it in 1993 by cooking the bomb, training the driver, giving him the detonators.
[01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:43.010]  And it was hidden in plain view, and they were doing drills, and had done drills before in and around a federal building being bombed, like OKC.
[01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:47.236]  And so I saw the Dark Winter exercising, top off.
[01:14:48.857 --> 01:14:51.360]  And others, and so I went on and I saw the media getting everybody ready.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.361]  Terror is about to happen.
[01:14:52.381 --> 01:14:53.422]  Give your rights up when it happens.
[01:14:53.762 --> 01:14:56.805]  So I went on there and said that and a few affiliates called up and said, you're crazy.
[01:14:56.845 --> 01:14:57.566]  We're dumping your show.
[01:14:57.606 --> 01:14:59.728]  And I said, please don't, but do what you have to.
[01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:00.869]  And they did dump.
[01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:03.852]  And then I, the show was bigger AM and FM wise.
[01:15:03.912 --> 01:15:08.417]  It's bigger internet, shortwave, satellite, you know, overall now than it was seven years ago.
[01:15:08.497 --> 01:15:11.800]  But affiliate wise, I almost got up to 80 affiliates.
[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:12.541]  I mean, it was big.
[01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:16.839]  We had stuff like Liberty Works and a bunch of other little networks carrying stuff.
[01:15:16.859 --> 01:15:18.080]  That's how we got up to about 80 affiliates.
[01:15:18.761 --> 01:15:21.464]  And man, I went on air that day and said it's an inside job.
[01:15:22.305 --> 01:15:24.567]  I said they're probably going to launch an anthrax attack that day.
[01:15:25.168 --> 01:15:29.352]  And let me tell you, I mean, we had like 25, 30 stations that day turned it off.
[01:15:29.472 --> 01:15:32.615]  In fact, they called and they said, promise not to say that anymore.
[01:15:33.496 --> 01:15:38.057]  The program director called me and said, we never told you what to say, but here's all these stations that give me their phone numbers.
[01:15:38.137 --> 01:15:45.399]  So I called them that day and that next day, and they'd say, look, buddy, you're not going to say that on here.
[01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:47.339]  You know, we know you're right about the U.N.
[01:15:47.359 --> 01:15:48.340]  and the New World Order, but you're not.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.200]  And I said, look, it's going to come out.
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:50.900]  It's an inside job.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.241]  Are you aware of Operation Northwoods?
[01:15:52.261 --> 01:15:54.321]  You're aware of... And they said, look, I don't care.
[01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:55.642]  You're not going to say that on this station.
[01:15:56.022 --> 01:15:57.242]  And I said, well, do what you got to do.
[01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:04.358]  Now there's a lot of talk out there about how people won't be censored and they won't compromise, but then I've seen everybody do it.
[01:16:05.258 --> 01:16:08.240]  A station calls these other hosts or other networks up, they crap their pants.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.201]  And they say, we're not going to talk about the New World Order period.
[01:16:12.481 --> 01:16:14.942]  That's selling out all the way from the beginning.
[01:16:15.382 --> 01:16:15.883]  Not me!
[01:16:17.483 --> 01:16:18.183]  And you know why?
[01:16:18.243 --> 01:16:21.665]  Because I don't care about gold and silver or diamonds or property.
[01:16:22.847 --> 01:16:23.667]  I care about life.
[01:16:24.287 --> 01:16:25.088]  I care about my family.
[01:16:25.108 --> 01:16:26.108]  I care about my family name.
[01:16:26.328 --> 01:16:27.488]  I care about who I am.
[01:16:27.569 --> 01:16:28.429]  That's my value.
[01:16:28.689 --> 01:16:32.070]  My value is not being conned, not being manipulated, and standing up to bullies.
[01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:36.091]  And having the courage to study and be a scholar of this.
[01:16:36.511 --> 01:16:38.752]  Does that mean I'm the perfect person to bring this information forward?
[01:16:38.792 --> 01:16:38.972]  No.
[01:16:39.272 --> 01:16:41.253]  But I'm the person that's willing to do it.
[01:16:43.754 --> 01:16:45.534]  And that's why the enemy wants to pull me down.
[01:16:45.894 --> 01:16:47.215]  They want to kill me.
[01:16:48.686 --> 01:16:50.427]  They have told me they plan to kill me.
[01:16:50.508 --> 01:16:51.628]  I don't know if that's the case.
[01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:52.709]  They've even threatened my family.
[01:16:52.989 --> 01:16:54.090]  I'm past the point of return.
[01:16:54.150 --> 01:16:54.991]  I can't give in to that.
[01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.172]  I will not give in to that.
[01:16:58.634 --> 01:17:00.075]  And none of us are perfect.
[01:17:00.095 --> 01:17:03.858]  And in some cases, years ago, I wasn't in this for all the right reasons.
[01:17:03.898 --> 01:17:05.760]  I mean, overall I was, but I had problems.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.401]  I had vestigial problems.
[01:17:07.441 --> 01:17:09.903]  But all that is literally peeling away.
[01:17:10.183 --> 01:17:11.825]  It's almost completely peeled away from me.
[01:17:12.185 --> 01:17:13.566]  I'm a completely different person.
[01:17:13.606 --> 01:17:17.149]  I was already an interesting person, overall a good person with a big heart.
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:35.369]  But to face my fears time and time again, to go to that next level, and to see the people we've woken up, to see the people we've energized, to see the movements that we have spawned together.
[01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:38.672]  I'm a very small part of it.
[01:17:38.692 --> 01:17:39.953]  It's you, the listeners of this show.
[01:17:40.033 --> 01:17:40.554]  You did it.
[01:17:40.574 --> 01:17:41.334]  98% of it.
[01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:45.501]  The go-getters.
[01:17:46.202 --> 01:17:47.082]  The people that know.
[01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:53.887]  And so many of them are great veterans and school teachers and old black men and young white women and Hispanics.
[01:17:53.927 --> 01:17:54.527]  It doesn't matter.
[01:17:54.607 --> 01:17:55.028]  Everybody.
[01:17:55.168 --> 01:17:57.589]  Farm folks, doctors, lawyers.
[01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:59.751]  You know who you are out there.
[01:18:02.777 --> 01:18:05.279]  And if I've got it, you know, early on I had to be the bad man.
[01:18:05.479 --> 01:18:07.520]  I had to be the, you know, the dark knight as they say.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.221]  I had to be the bad guy.
[01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:15.865]  I had to be the one that got all the attacks heaped on me and all the laughing and the giggling and the nut who thought it was an inside job.
[01:18:16.645 --> 01:18:17.126]  But you know what?
[01:18:17.226 --> 01:18:19.607]  It was a blessing to hit the barbed wire for everybody else.
[01:18:19.887 --> 01:18:23.510]  It was a blessing because I knew what it would lead to and I don't care
[01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:25.491]  If people laugh at me.
[01:18:25.631 --> 01:18:27.092]  I don't care if people degrade me.
[01:18:27.332 --> 01:18:37.518]  It doesn't matter if I was covered with cream pie naked in front of a million people with them giggling at me or throwing tomatoes at me in the stocks.
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:46.144]  Because what matters is what reality is and what decency is and what the truth is.
[01:18:48.086 --> 01:18:50.148]  And folks, you know, come in for the big win.
[01:18:50.648 --> 01:18:51.589]  Be part of history.
[01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:52.489]  Be part of honor.
[01:18:52.549 --> 01:18:53.490]  Be part of courage.
[01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:55.231]  Be part of saying no to evil.
[01:18:57.753 --> 01:18:59.194]  And shed your worldliness.
[01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:05.079]  You won't feel inadequate anymore about how fancy your car is or how big your house is.
[01:19:05.099 --> 01:19:06.060]  You won't feel inadequate.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.982]  You won't have that spot in your heart missing anymore.
[01:19:10.343 --> 01:19:14.086]  You have a spot, a vacuum in you because you're not getting the truth.
[01:19:16.247 --> 01:19:21.471]  People feel inadequate out there because they've never tied into reality and what it really is to be human.
[01:19:22.252 --> 01:19:23.433]  And to be part of something bigger.
[01:19:24.654 --> 01:19:25.815]  And that amazing journey.
[01:19:27.176 --> 01:19:27.956]  One life to live.
[01:19:28.677 --> 01:19:29.878]  One life to make it or break it.
[01:19:30.158 --> 01:19:31.339]  What is your destiny going to be?
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:33.281]  To serve evil or to serve good?
[01:19:34.882 --> 01:19:36.203]  Now that's the question I ask you.
[01:19:38.986 --> 01:19:40.327]  And it isn't about Alex Jones.
[01:19:40.867 --> 01:19:43.770]  You know, I don't want people to defend me as I'm attacked by the enemy.
[01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:49.624]  Now, I mean, it's kind of like we're going over barbed wire here and I've been hit by a mortar and my guts are hanging out.
[01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:53.146]  Folks, if we don't take those machine gun nests, we're all going to get killed.
[01:19:53.546 --> 01:19:55.167]  I want you to just leave me lying.
[01:19:55.267 --> 01:19:58.609]  I have done my work and figuratively my guts aren't blown out.
[01:19:58.649 --> 01:20:01.750]  We're bigger and badder and having a bigger effect on the New World Order than ever.
[01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:07.673]  But the point is, don't defend me on the message boards, the websites, the radio talk shows.
[01:20:09.174 --> 01:20:12.055]  When you call in, don't make it about Alex Jones.
[01:20:12.276 --> 01:20:13.396]  That's what the enemy wants.
[01:20:13.436 --> 01:20:14.797]  They want to tie you up in that debate.
[01:20:16.371 --> 01:20:18.652]  Make it about, is sodium fluoride poisonous?
[01:20:19.132 --> 01:20:19.852]  Is it bad for you?
[01:20:19.892 --> 01:20:20.492]  Here's the evidence.
[01:20:20.752 --> 01:20:23.553]  Make it about, is mercury in the vaccines and is it bad if it is?
[01:20:23.693 --> 01:20:24.153]  Yes it is.
[01:20:25.293 --> 01:20:29.434]  Or, are the troops having to serve four or five tours and mentally destroying them?
[01:20:29.674 --> 01:20:32.215]  Or, is DEU deadly for the troops and is it being used?
[01:20:32.475 --> 01:20:34.355]  And do the army manuals admit it was deadly?
[01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:41.817]  Or, have the private banks set this up to turn America into a police state and steal all of our wealth in a quote, bailout?
[01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:43.097]  And yes they are.
[01:20:45.018 --> 01:20:45.078]  Or,
[01:20:46.929 --> 01:20:49.371]  Did eyewitnesses report bombs going off in the buildings?
[01:20:49.752 --> 01:20:51.093]  And are those witnesses being killed?
[01:20:52.454 --> 01:20:53.995]  Two witnesses have died in the last month.
[01:20:54.656 --> 01:20:54.936]  Killed.
[01:20:55.136 --> 01:20:55.557]  Definitely.
[01:20:56.998 --> 01:20:58.319]  What are we going to do right now?
[01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:01.562]  That's our choice.
[01:21:01.622 --> 01:21:03.764]  That's the decision we have to make.
[01:21:03.804 --> 01:21:04.745]  We've gone this far.
[01:21:04.785 --> 01:21:07.527]  We've literally gone 80% of the way in the fight for 9-11 truth.
[01:21:09.542 --> 01:21:13.803]  And it isn't just about 9-11 truth, it's about stopping future-stage terror attacks.
[01:21:13.863 --> 01:21:22.966]  It's about stopping the globalists from blowing up more buildings, releasing bioweapons, launching new wars, setting off suitcase nukes.
[01:21:23.346 --> 01:21:26.167]  All these things they've said they do, and they always keep their promises.
[01:21:26.867 --> 01:21:27.707]  Unless confronted.
[01:21:30.945 --> 01:21:35.192]  Are we going to continue to expose inside jobs so that it exposes it into the future?
[01:21:35.392 --> 01:21:37.435]  And so that's the first thing people think if it happens.
[01:21:37.695 --> 01:21:45.007]  So the enemy with the NSA can sample what the public's really saying and realize a false flag terror attack isn't going to go over with these people.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:22:06.859]  And so people in government, like the ones that leaked it to Seymour Hersh of the New Yorker Magazine, that Dick Cheney was planning to make fake Iranian speedboats, military patrol boats, paint them up blue, and have Navy SEALs dressed up in Iranian uniforms, pull up under orders and attack a U.S.
[01:22:06.879 --> 01:22:10.764]  destroyer, and the destroyer was then going to destroy that ship and say it was Iranians.
[01:22:14.110 --> 01:22:16.171]  That shows the dirty stuff they've had SEALs doing.
[01:22:16.211 --> 01:22:18.151]  Good God, they were ready to attack our own ships.
[01:22:19.092 --> 01:22:22.793]  The point is, that came out and we stopped it because of 9-11 truth.
[01:22:23.053 --> 01:22:24.093]  THE KEY!
[01:22:24.474 --> 01:22:25.554]  And the enemy hates that.
[01:22:25.794 --> 01:22:27.815]  It's the key to grassroots organization.
[01:22:28.035 --> 01:22:31.916]  The key to people getting in government's face with real issues, not the controlled left-right paradigm.
[01:22:32.256 --> 01:22:33.997]  It's the key to guerrilla media.
[01:22:34.297 --> 01:22:37.998]  It's the key to people handing out information, not just on this subject, but hundreds of others.
[01:22:38.218 --> 01:22:40.079]  We're defeating the North American Union right now.
[01:22:40.319 --> 01:22:43.684]  With all the data, and the information, and the activism, and the confrontations.
[01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:55.199]  And going to city halls, and university lectures, and corporate lectures, and confronting all the former Attorney Generals, and Senators, and Congress people, and Presidents.
[01:22:56.175 --> 01:22:57.156]  With real issues.
[01:22:57.976 --> 01:23:01.999]  And it's easy to Monday morning quarterback and say, well some ask the questions wrong or some ask them right.
[01:23:02.219 --> 01:23:03.480]  The point is it's the process.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.500]  They're on the field.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.921]  They're engaging the enemy.
[01:23:06.201 --> 01:23:07.262]  I salute you!
[01:23:07.943 --> 01:23:08.863]  That's what it's all about.
[01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:10.224]  It's about taking action.
[01:23:10.624 --> 01:23:12.105]  Do we do perfect every time?
[01:23:12.285 --> 01:23:13.786]  Do we make a first down every down?
[01:23:13.846 --> 01:23:14.106]  No!
[01:23:14.307 --> 01:23:17.469]  We go out there, we do the best job we can, and we learn from it.
[01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:23.052]  And we commit our lives, our names, our sacred honor, our families, fully!
[01:23:23.873 --> 01:23:30.878]  The enemy's going to take it all regardless, so the only chance we've got of survival, the only chance we've got of a future, is to fight these people 110%!
[01:23:31.478 --> 01:23:43.286]  So I'm begging you to realize we've had a massive effect and we've gone supernova.
[01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:44.447]  It's exponential.
[01:23:44.647 --> 01:23:46.088]  The chain reaction is beautiful.
[01:23:49.755 --> 01:23:57.959]  And there have been many battles in history where the enemy, with cavalry, going back thousands of years, would learn the horn signals of the other side.
[01:23:58.559 --> 01:24:00.780]  And if they started losing, they would play a dirty trick.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.901]  Or it's like a fake handoff in football.
[01:24:03.421 --> 01:24:05.322]  They'd blow the horns for the retreat.
[01:24:06.663 --> 01:24:11.165]  They'd have their scouts go around behind the other army and come up on a rock and blow the retreat horn.
[01:24:11.725 --> 01:24:16.647]  And that would a lot of times make an army that was winning go, Oh my God, the battle's over!
[01:24:17.007 --> 01:24:18.548]  The signal to pull back's been given.
[01:24:19.445 --> 01:24:30.499]  So that's why they started going to horns, drums, and flags, so that there'd be flag signals from the back and the officers, and flag signals in the front.
[01:24:30.859 --> 01:24:34.124]  You're having military operations launched on you!
[01:24:34.744 --> 01:24:36.967]  These people think it's cute what they're doing!
[01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:48.571]  All of you, first year good old boys, you sign on to it, you get some of the graft and payoffs in the black ops system and then you're sheep dipped into bloody corruption and now you think it's funny what you're part of.
[01:24:48.812 --> 01:24:51.172]  You've signed on to the abomination desolation.
[01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:55.094]  You've signed on to every evil committed against innocence.
[01:24:55.754 --> 01:24:58.134]  You have signed on to the destruction of your soul.
[01:24:58.455 --> 01:24:59.395]  And let me tell you something.
[01:25:00.882 --> 01:25:02.423]  Deep down you know you got a soul.
[01:25:02.884 --> 01:25:09.229]  In your gut you know you do and that's why right now you're uncomfortable listening to this and watching this if you serve evil.
[01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:12.332]  And I want you to know something, you're not going to escape judgment.
[01:25:13.013 --> 01:25:14.514]  And you're going to be judged while you're alive.
[01:25:15.195 --> 01:25:16.055]  That's a little secret.
[01:25:17.917 --> 01:25:19.979]  Oh yeah, there's a second judgment but there's a first one.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:21.941]  And I wouldn't want to be you.
[01:25:23.345 --> 01:25:24.326]  You are blind.
[01:25:24.366 --> 01:25:25.546]  Don't you want to have sight?
[01:25:26.427 --> 01:25:27.807]  Don't you understand you've been robbed?
[01:25:27.867 --> 01:25:31.469]  All that matters is your intellect and your mind and knowing the truth.
[01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:34.631]  Don't you understand that?
[01:25:40.674 --> 01:25:41.835]  I love to see people do well.
[01:25:42.335 --> 01:25:42.776]  Don't you?
[01:25:42.856 --> 01:25:43.976]  But others out there, they don't.
[01:25:44.597 --> 01:25:47.238]  And it's that evil idea that expands and grows from there.
[01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:49.359]  And our enemies rationalize everything they do.
[01:25:49.559 --> 01:25:52.501]  They make up bad things about us so they can persecute us.
[01:25:53.971 --> 01:25:58.134]  They exaggerate things about us, so they can persecute us and feel good about what they do.
[01:25:58.955 --> 01:26:00.116]  But they're going to fail in the end.
[01:26:01.237 --> 01:26:04.679]  I'm going to cover economic news when we get back, and boy is it serious.
[01:26:04.739 --> 01:26:07.542]  Recap some of the stuff we've covered, cover some of the things we haven't.
[01:26:09.443 --> 01:26:11.645]  And then in the next hour, I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:26:11.685 --> 01:26:15.248]  And I'm going to open them up on my phone system here, because I like the phone system.
[01:26:16.969 --> 01:26:19.111]  You can take 20-30 calls, it seems like you get even better ones.
[01:26:21.041 --> 01:26:23.782]  And then we'll also open up the Genesis phone lines, 800-259-9231.
[01:26:23.802 --> 01:26:27.804]  I've got a lot of other bizarre news as well.
[01:26:30.265 --> 01:26:35.367]  The number here at my studio is 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[01:26:37.288 --> 01:26:39.429]  Phone system won't be on for about five minutes, though, but that's the number.
[01:26:39.449 --> 01:26:39.849]  888-201-2244.
[01:26:39.869 --> 01:26:41.470]  First-time callers on that line, by the way, 888-201-2244.
[01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:42.771]  And first-time callers at 800-259-9231.
[01:26:42.811 --> 01:26:43.351]  Let's do that today.
[01:26:51.121 --> 01:26:54.724]  Okay, uh, we'll be right back with the financial news blitz of information.
[01:26:55.045 --> 01:26:56.786]  Big attacks on the First Amendment as well.
[01:26:57.247 --> 01:26:58.007]  Key information.
[01:26:58.107 --> 01:26:58.968]  Huge developments.
[01:26:59.028 --> 01:27:01.190]  More things happening in a day now than used to happen in a decade.
[01:27:01.711 --> 01:27:06.815]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act... Hey, Jones?
[01:27:09.898 --> 01:27:10.158]  Number 11.
[01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:12.133]  But who is the enemy?
[01:27:12.634 --> 01:27:13.154]  Bin Laden.
[01:27:13.435 --> 01:27:14.436]  This is his M.O.
[01:27:14.456 --> 01:27:15.737]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:27:15.777 --> 01:27:17.499]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:24.547]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:27:24.947 --> 01:27:25.388]  Some U.S.
[01:27:25.428 --> 01:27:31.114]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:27:31.774 --> 01:27:35.296]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:27:35.656 --> 01:27:45.502]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:27:45.742 --> 01:27:46.502]  Fabled Enemies.

[01:27:54.727 --> 01:27:58.089]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:28:01.983 --> 01:28:05.348]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:10.715]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:28:10.895 --> 01:28:15.601]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:28:16.903 --> 01:28:27.208]  KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:33.111]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:28:33.331 --> 01:28:39.414]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:40.274]  What about you?

[01:29:12.899 --> 01:29:13.520]  Here is why.

[01:29:24.813 --> 01:29:27.195]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[01:29:27.535 --> 01:29:29.637]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:29:29.657 --> 01:29:30.157]  this fall?
[01:29:30.638 --> 01:29:31.158]  Don't wait!

[01:29:56.150 --> 01:29:56.490]  Act now!
[01:30:32.774 --> 01:30:34.735]  Well, we've seen Lehman Brothers go under.
[01:30:36.016 --> 01:30:39.538]  Fifty billion dollars, leveraged over a hundred times.
[01:30:41.819 --> 01:30:43.180]  Trillions and trillions.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:47.403]  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, trillions, leveraged hundreds of times.
[01:30:48.516 --> 01:30:50.657]  Just unlimited robbery.
[01:30:51.017 --> 01:30:54.219]  And the federal government is saying they'll bail out the automakers.
[01:30:54.399 --> 01:30:56.360]  They'll bail out any banks.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:58.562]  They'll bail out anything and everything.
[01:30:58.862 --> 01:31:00.163]  But it's not a bailout.
[01:31:01.023 --> 01:31:02.484]  These banks were used as fronts.
[01:31:04.386 --> 01:31:14.353]  To sell packages of securities that were basically based on nothing, and then leverage that out ten times, and then leverage it out ten times, and then ten times.
[01:31:14.933 --> 01:31:19.016]  And so now they've got to leave somebody holding the bag, and that is us, and God help us.
[01:31:21.038 --> 01:31:28.423]  Eighty-five billion dollar bailout today of AIG that was the big insurance, the insurer of the stocks and bonds.
[01:31:30.523 --> 01:31:31.063]  The U.S.
[01:31:31.143 --> 01:31:35.945]  Treasury three-month bill rate drops the lowest since 1954, more than 50 years.
[01:31:37.185 --> 01:31:41.427]  So the United States credit is now beginning to suffer worldwide.
[01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:50.791]  That's why suddenly gold, which they've artificially been suppressing so they could buy it up, spiked more than $50 today.
[01:31:50.811 --> 01:31:53.392]  They can drive it down, but only for a matter of time.
[01:31:55.112 --> 01:31:58.553]  Morgan Stanley's weighing possible merger report to try to stay afloat.
[01:31:58.593 --> 01:31:59.554]  That's out of Reuters.
[01:32:01.069 --> 01:32:04.150]  That's one of the other big five, two of them gone under this week.
[01:32:05.351 --> 01:32:08.652]  Reduced dominance is predicted for U.S.
[01:32:08.752 --> 01:32:11.733]  analysts' previous report to next president.
[01:32:12.134 --> 01:32:13.734]  This is the Washington Post saying the U.S.
[01:32:13.754 --> 01:32:15.255]  will basically be a banana republic.
[01:32:16.015 --> 01:32:17.056]  That was always the plan.
[01:32:17.076 --> 01:32:22.918]  That's why all the industries, tax incentives to move offshore, and then again put everything on the hated Americans back.
[01:32:24.559 --> 01:32:30.221]  And as long as they put an American flag on our face, we will do whatever they say while these anti-Americans rape us financially.
[01:32:34.815 --> 01:32:42.800]  So, I mean, we are just seeing the worst possible scenarios in all of this economically happening.
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:46.222]  And there's no talk of criminal charges, no talk of investigations.
[01:32:46.722 --> 01:32:51.245]  In fact, the news keeps saying, and the government officials keep saying, oh, well, nobody did anything wrong.
[01:32:51.685 --> 01:32:59.149]  Nobody at Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Lehman Brothers or any of these companies are going to get in trouble.
[01:32:59.189 --> 01:33:00.470]  Nobody at Goldman Sachs.
[01:33:02.031 --> 01:33:02.991]  Nobody at
[01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:06.484]  Bear Stearns.
[01:33:06.984 --> 01:33:15.271]  It's just, you know, trillions of dollars is missing, and trillions from the Pentagon's been stolen, and nothing's going to be done, because it's planned to happen that way.
[01:33:15.351 --> 01:33:20.656]  And then, it's not enough, they're just going to run off and run a scam, where they bought real assets.
[01:33:20.976 --> 01:33:25.280]  See, they keep saying, well, governments can print money, but they can't make wealth with it.
[01:33:26.001 --> 01:33:26.621]  That's not true.
[01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:35.123]  During the first part of the Ponzi scheme, it's still valued, and people will accept it for yachts and skyscrapers and companies.
[01:33:35.844 --> 01:33:43.125]  And then it's us that gets handed it at the end, when all the corruption's been about like this, and now, in the next year or so, it'll just be to the moon.
[01:33:43.646 --> 01:33:47.707]  Just, you know, a few inches of corruption is enough to overthrow the entire financial order.
[01:33:48.767 --> 01:33:52.668]  But now, at the end, they just run it all the way out to infinity.
[01:33:53.786 --> 01:33:58.569]  And have their paramilitary continuity of government system stand by to control everybody.
[01:34:01.911 --> 01:34:02.851]  This is their plan.
[01:34:04.112 --> 01:34:10.395]  And so they tell us here, an intelligence forecast being prepared for the next president on global risk envisions a steady decline in U.S.
[01:34:10.415 --> 01:34:14.438]  dominance in the coming decades as the world is reshaped by globalization.
[01:34:14.758 --> 01:34:20.181]  See, they use the substance like a baby bird uses the yolk in the egg to feed itself.
[01:34:21.882 --> 01:34:23.323]  Or not the yolk, the outside part.
[01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:27.411]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:35:58.540 --> 01:36:01.323]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[01:36:11.072 --> 01:36:16.835]  We are already into the fourth and final hour, opening the phones up, and we have each caller about one minute on air.
[01:36:16.916 --> 01:36:29.943]  We have a lot of other important news, like the Congress on the verge of passing a law to restrict internet-free speech massively, and they've singled out 9-11 Truth to be banned specifically.
[01:36:31.404 --> 01:36:32.265]  It is confirmed.
[01:36:34.006 --> 01:36:40.550]  So we're seeing just open, final assaults on the Republic, on the Bill of Rights, on the Constitution.
[01:36:44.417 --> 01:36:46.319]  I talked to Ted Anderson this morning when gold was up $50.
[01:36:46.399 --> 01:36:49.982]  It's up $85, almost $90 today.
[01:36:50.963 --> 01:36:51.764]  Exploding!
[01:36:53.005 --> 01:36:59.490]  And we had said that when the winter got here, it was guaranteed to go back up past its previous high of $1,100 an ounce.
[01:36:59.891 --> 01:37:02.253]  Remember, it was just $260-something bucks five years ago.
[01:37:03.954 --> 01:37:08.559]  But they can only suppress the price of gold and commodities so long when the dollars devalue.
[01:37:09.724 --> 01:37:11.605]  And the announcement that the U.S.
[01:37:11.645 --> 01:37:19.689]  Treasury, through the private Federal Reserve, stands behind tens of trillions, which has been leveraged into thousands of trillions.
[01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:34.376]  Every day, you know, 100 billion, 50 billion, 87 million, one day 50-something trillion, that was two weeks ago, bailouts, and the world is saying, sayonara dollar, and we're getting the lowest bond rating on U.S.
[01:37:34.416 --> 01:37:35.316]  bonds in the last 54 years.
[01:37:38.601 --> 01:37:47.263]  So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, because I need to get into YouTube and attack on free speech, because we can always get our economy back, even through a depression, but if we don't have liberty, none of it will come back.
[01:37:47.763 --> 01:37:48.804]  I mean, folks, it's all happening.
[01:37:48.824 --> 01:37:50.024]  They're pulling out the stops right now.
[01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:56.226]  Before we were just starting down the slide, now we're racing down it into the pool of alcohol, as they say.
[01:37:56.626 --> 01:37:57.746]  Down the razor blade into that.
[01:37:59.057 --> 01:38:00.919]  Just massive stuff developing here.
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:09.906]  But Ted is going to offer gold at the same price he offered it yesterday at $85 an ounce under what it was.
[01:38:09.966 --> 01:38:12.108]  Now, he's never offered a deal this good.
[01:38:12.148 --> 01:38:13.930]  He just told me during the break, he said, I'm going to offer this.
[01:38:14.230 --> 01:38:14.850]  Can I come on?
[01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:15.791]  I talked to him this morning.
[01:38:15.811 --> 01:38:16.972]  I didn't know this was the deal he was offering.
[01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:18.734]  Ted, count me in on that.
[01:38:18.774 --> 01:38:20.916]  I forgot to try to put a little silver order in yesterday.
[01:38:21.897 --> 01:38:24.562]  He's going to run out probably in the next 12 hours or so.
[01:38:24.963 --> 01:38:26.045]  We've told you this.
[01:38:26.085 --> 01:38:26.986]  He has a position.
[01:38:27.287 --> 01:38:29.030]  He has this gold and silver in his safe.
[01:38:29.491 --> 01:38:30.473]  He bought it when it was $85 less.
[01:38:33.018 --> 01:38:39.062]  He secured it when it hit a low, and the gold is going to go up and down before it goes to the moon.
[01:38:39.102 --> 01:38:41.884]  The point is, fundamentally, the dollar is going to zero.
[01:38:41.964 --> 01:38:45.487]  That's what all common sense and history and facts are on.
[01:38:45.867 --> 01:38:47.728]  When she stops, nobody knows.
[01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:49.049]  Round and round she goes.
[01:38:49.089 --> 01:38:50.010]  When it stops, nobody knows.
[01:38:50.190 --> 01:38:51.131]  It's like musical chairs.
[01:38:51.851 --> 01:38:53.152]  But I would get your chair now.
[01:38:53.232 --> 01:38:53.973]  Don't get left out.
[01:38:54.353 --> 01:38:58.136]  Ted, this deal you're offering, you've never, nothing ever has come close to this.
[01:38:58.416 --> 01:38:58.896]  Not ever.
[01:38:59.136 --> 01:38:59.837]  Not ever, Alex.
[01:38:59.897 --> 01:39:08.601]  I can tell you in the history since I've been working in gold, I don't ever remember seeing a day where gold has gone up 85 bucks in one day.
[01:39:09.142 --> 01:39:15.165]  And I locked this stuff in yesterday at 7, what was it, 780-something when we were talking yesterday on the air.
[01:39:15.725 --> 01:39:18.026]  I'm not kidding you, man.
[01:39:18.046 --> 01:39:22.929]  I am selling British sovereigns and French francs for less than spot right now.
[01:39:22.989 --> 01:39:23.629]  People can't
[01:39:23.939 --> 01:39:26.400]  You can call across the entire world if you want to.
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:30.901]  You're not going to find anybody offering it to you for less unless your mom and dad want to give it to you for free.
[01:39:31.701 --> 01:39:35.282]  This is really, really quite a deal.
[01:39:35.642 --> 01:39:39.723]  Right now I've got British Sovereigns at $217 apiece.
[01:39:40.283 --> 01:39:41.483]  Same price as yesterday.
[01:39:42.104 --> 01:39:43.744]  Franks at $173.
[01:39:44.364 --> 01:39:47.965]  I also still have a good supply of those Walking Liberty halves.
[01:39:48.365 --> 01:39:50.026]  Silver's up, what, two bucks right now? $6.95.
[01:39:52.330 --> 01:40:00.734]  Alex, right now, you better move in, because the only time you see a market move like this is when it's being manipulated.
[01:40:00.774 --> 01:40:02.374]  Hey, Ted, can we boost your audio up there?
[01:40:02.414 --> 01:40:03.635]  It's definitely low on my board.
[01:40:04.035 --> 01:40:04.395]  Oh, okay.
[01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:05.716]  Guys, can we get his audio boosted?
[01:40:05.736 --> 01:40:06.076]  Thank you.
[01:40:07.037 --> 01:40:08.337]  Continue repeating that special, Ted.
[01:40:08.557 --> 01:40:10.378]  Yeah, I'll just go for it again here.
[01:40:10.418 --> 01:40:13.219]  I mean, we're at $6.95 for Walking Liberties.
[01:40:13.279 --> 01:40:15.940]  We are at $217 on British Sovereigns, and we're at $173 on the Frank.
[01:40:22.782 --> 01:40:24.382]  Those gold coins are below spot.
[01:40:24.702 --> 01:40:26.643]  Those silver coins are at spot right now.
[01:40:27.003 --> 01:40:28.763]  You can call across the entire world.
[01:40:28.783 --> 01:40:30.844]  You're not going to find them for this price anywhere else.
[01:40:31.164 --> 01:40:34.344]  And Ted, you're offering this because you love giving people good deals.
[01:40:34.664 --> 01:40:35.604]  You secured these.
[01:40:35.624 --> 01:40:39.545]  You bought them for $85 or $90 now.
[01:40:39.605 --> 01:40:42.386]  It's rising under what it's selling for now.
[01:40:42.806 --> 01:40:44.966]  And you were telling me you can't offer this long, can you?
[01:40:45.026 --> 01:40:45.486]  No.
[01:40:45.686 --> 01:40:49.527]  If you don't call today and say you've called on the Alex Jones special, you're not going to get this.
[01:40:49.827 --> 01:40:50.227]  800-686-2237.
[01:40:50.247 --> 01:40:51.127]  800-686-2237.
[01:40:51.527 --> 01:40:55.989]  They're standing by.
[01:40:56.069 --> 01:40:56.989]  First come, first serve.
[01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.689]  Stay there, Ted.
[01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:59.049]  I've got some economic questions for you.
[01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:08.131]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:41:08.512 --> 01:41:10.172]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:41:11.147 --> 01:41:12.208]  But who is the enemy?
[01:41:12.688 --> 01:41:13.228]  Bin Laden.
[01:41:13.488 --> 01:41:14.509]  This is his ammo.
[01:41:14.529 --> 01:41:15.789]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:41:15.829 --> 01:41:17.530]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:41:17.850 --> 01:41:24.613]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:41:24.993 --> 01:41:25.433]  Some U.S.
[01:41:25.473 --> 01:41:31.136]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:41:31.836 --> 01:41:35.318]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:41:35.338 --> 01:41:45.563]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:41:45.803 --> 01:41:46.543]  Fabled enemies.

[01:42:05.144 --> 01:42:08.070]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:11.055]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:42:11.075 --> 01:42:13.921]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[01:44:01.275 --> 01:44:06.336]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:06.656 --> 01:44:08.957]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:44:10.731 --> 01:44:24.998]  Ted Anderson right now, the owner of the GCN Radio Network, and also owner of Midas Resources, for my listeners alone, is offering gold at close to $90 under what it was yesterday.
[01:44:25.018 --> 01:44:26.759]  $90 under spot.
[01:44:27.319 --> 01:44:30.541]  You cannot... Ted, this deal
[01:44:31.837 --> 01:44:34.738]  You usually just offer it at whatever the current rate is.
[01:44:35.998 --> 01:44:39.279]  And that's a super good deal, because there's really no markup for you to even pay your brokers.
[01:44:40.179 --> 01:44:42.360]  And you do that as a promotional deal for the show.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:47.881]  And some folks will get into the market and see how good it is, and actually physically hold gold and silver and other metals.
[01:44:48.421 --> 01:44:50.142]  But why are you doing this?
[01:44:50.342 --> 01:44:53.303]  I guess because you have the stores of gold and silver at the lower price?
[01:44:53.743 --> 01:44:57.184]  Well, we had the ability to lock in when the market was low.
[01:44:58.906 --> 01:45:01.588]  And I'd rather pass it on to the people that are listening.
[01:45:01.688 --> 01:45:08.954]  I tell you, Alex, I got the same lecture from my buyer, Mona, who actually, she manages all my buyers.
[01:45:08.994 --> 01:45:10.035]  I've got about five of them.
[01:45:10.795 --> 01:45:12.216]  And she says, what are you doing?
[01:45:12.337 --> 01:45:15.439]  She says, if we sell more than this, we're going to be, you know, that's OK.
[01:45:15.499 --> 01:45:16.440]  I mean, I'll take the risk.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:26.868]  I mean, the people have done so much to, you know, just going to that Ron Paul convention, having 10,000 people standing there and asking for the Federal Reserve System to be shut down.
[01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:28.391]  Is such a treat for me.
[01:45:28.431 --> 01:45:38.619]  I mean, you don't understand how much that means to me to be able to see that, and having about 80% of the people in the place already know who I am and thanking me for what I've done.
[01:45:39.019 --> 01:45:41.501]  It's not what I've done, and it's not necessarily what you've done, Alex.
[01:45:41.561 --> 01:45:44.243]  All these people have set forth and done so much.
[01:45:44.283 --> 01:45:47.326]  Well, talking about 9-11 Truth, Ventura did it at the Ron Paul event.
[01:45:47.646 --> 01:45:52.830]  He got a standing ovation, and now we have Ralph Nader coming out for 9-11 Truth.
[01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:56.433]  We have Dennis Kucinich coming out for 9-11 Truth, and we have these more and more
[01:45:56.673 --> 01:46:00.237]  Big, mainline, people that have tens of millions of supporters.
[01:46:00.698 --> 01:46:04.462]  I mean, 9-11 Truth, from your perspective, are you seeing it get bigger or smaller?
[01:46:04.622 --> 01:46:06.084]  Oh, it's getting way bigger, Alex.
[01:46:06.344 --> 01:46:09.488]  You can remember what it was like years ago when we first started all this stuff.
[01:46:09.548 --> 01:46:10.549]  In fact, you remember that.
[01:46:10.929 --> 01:46:12.371]  You and Trudeau got me on the phone.
[01:46:12.411 --> 01:46:15.474]  You said, look, we're not going to tell you what to say, but all these affiliates are dumping.
[01:46:16.235 --> 01:46:17.855]  We're not telling you to stop.
[01:46:17.975 --> 01:46:18.856]  Just be advised.
[01:46:19.296 --> 01:46:20.856]  I mean, you remember that, Ted, don't you?
[01:46:21.076 --> 01:46:23.917]  Oh, yeah, because everybody was so wigged out about this thing.
[01:46:23.957 --> 01:46:27.237]  I mean, it was, yay, rah, rah, let's go in and get Saddam Hussein.
[01:46:27.497 --> 01:46:31.358]  Not Saddam Hussein, but... I can't remember his name.
[01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:32.559]  Osama Bin Laden.
[01:46:33.139 --> 01:46:35.239]  And let's march off into war.
[01:46:35.279 --> 01:46:39.620]  It was like 90% of the people in this country wanted to kick some rear end, you know?
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:42.681]  And we're kicking the wrong people's rear end.
[01:46:42.721 --> 01:46:43.461]  That's the problem.
[01:46:43.951 --> 01:46:46.253]  And it was so distracting at that particular time.
[01:46:46.853 --> 01:46:58.422]  And here we've just grown into what, you know, Alex, honestly, I mean, you go back before that, the Oklahoma City bombing, there's been so many different... Oh yeah, my first film in 97 was about government-sponsored terror.
[01:46:58.542 --> 01:47:00.544]  I've always been on this subject.
[01:47:00.564 --> 01:47:05.608]  You know, we always talk about July 25th is when I said they're going to attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[01:47:05.868 --> 01:47:08.010]  I'd really been saying similar things the months before.
[01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:10.432]  I just named names and was specific
[01:47:11.252 --> 01:47:17.138]  uh... two months before uh... and you know i i i took a big hit and i went on air and said they're going to launch an anthrax attack
[01:47:17.881 --> 01:47:19.122]  You know, how did I know that?
[01:47:19.182 --> 01:47:22.445]  Well, hundreds of different points, sources, things I've witnessed.
[01:47:22.465 --> 01:47:30.052]  But the point is, folks, you get hardcore info on this show, and talk about the manipulation, how they were able to drive down gold by over $100 an ounce.
[01:47:30.352 --> 01:47:34.996]  Well, I really feel sorry for the people that are in that futures market.
[01:47:35.016 --> 01:47:41.002]  Right now, the people that are short on the marketplace, that thought it was going to be going down, are getting margin called up the rear end, man.
[01:47:41.042 --> 01:47:42.363]  They'll be lucky if they have any assets.
[01:47:42.363 --> 01:47:43.964]  But see, that's what the globalists do.
[01:47:44.024 --> 01:47:45.326]  They have been caught in lawsuits.
[01:47:45.346 --> 01:47:46.146]  They've been convicted.
[01:47:46.427 --> 01:47:49.129]  They manipulate the metals, prices, and other commodities.
[01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:57.797]  And down here in Texas, there's a lot of oil executives and people that my dad knows and I've talked to, and they say oil's going to go back up in the winter, back up in the summer.
[01:47:58.237 --> 01:47:59.078]  This is only the beginning.
[01:47:59.118 --> 01:48:01.881]  We'll see what's going to happen, but bottom line, announcing that
[01:48:02.461 --> 01:48:14.123]  I mean, you're a former Treasury Director, head of policy a few days ago on the show, saying he's afraid this will destroy the Treasury's solvency, and now foreigners giving us one of the lowest bond rates in U.S.
[01:48:14.163 --> 01:48:16.484]  history, the lowest in 54 years.
[01:48:17.424 --> 01:48:20.125]  I mean, they can't announce they're going to bail out trillions of dollars.
[01:48:22.645 --> 01:48:24.246]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:48:24.886 --> 01:48:28.086]  Folks, when they print more money and issue it, it devalues it.
[01:48:28.366 --> 01:48:29.467]  And I know most of you know that.
[01:48:29.687 --> 01:48:30.467]  For those that don't,
[01:48:31.047 --> 01:48:33.527]  It's going to take more dollars to buy gold and silver.
[01:48:33.768 --> 01:48:38.488]  They're talking about runs on banks in mainstream news, and banks are going under every day.
[01:48:38.668 --> 01:48:39.429]  Mega banks!
[01:48:39.489 --> 01:48:42.549]  I mean, three of the big five are insolvent.
[01:48:42.849 --> 01:48:44.830]  The other two are talking about going insolvent.
[01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:46.910]  This is Armageddon by design.
[01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:49.130]  They've moved the real assets out the back door.
[01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:51.031]  Ted, give them that offer one more time.
[01:48:51.171 --> 01:48:51.991]  Yeah, sure.
[01:48:52.051 --> 01:48:52.891]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:48:53.031 --> 01:48:55.712]  It's a Walking Liberty half silver half pieces.
[01:48:55.732 --> 01:48:56.512]  They're the ones from the 1940s.
[01:48:59.418 --> 01:49:00.119]  $6.95 a coin.
[01:49:00.159 --> 01:49:01.240]  They made the U.S.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.020]  Eagle, the new U.S.
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:04.943]  Eagle, to emulate that coin because it's so beautiful.
[01:49:04.963 --> 01:49:05.864]  It's a gorgeous coin.
[01:49:05.904 --> 01:49:06.625]  I've got a bag of them.
[01:49:06.925 --> 01:49:09.507]  And the next thing is that British Sovereign coin.
[01:49:09.547 --> 01:49:10.528]  Quarter-ounce gold piece.
[01:49:10.548 --> 01:49:11.429]  Do the math.
[01:49:11.949 --> 01:49:12.750]  $217 a piece.
[01:49:13.271 --> 01:49:14.672]  That's below spot.
[01:49:14.972 --> 01:49:15.753]  Frank, $1.73.
[01:49:16.213 --> 01:49:18.015]  That's one-fifth of an ounce of gold.
[01:49:18.876 --> 01:49:21.918]  Right now, at this particular time, you can't find a better buy.
[01:49:21.958 --> 01:49:24.781]  This is the best buy in the marketplace, and besides the fact
[01:49:25.199 --> 01:49:28.981]  Gold just went up like crazy, and like you said, Alex, there's enough financial institutions.
[01:49:29.361 --> 01:49:38.685]  If you had your money into an IRA, or if you have it in the bank, or if it's sitting somewhere in some stocks or bonds or wherever you're at, you've got to get away from the U.S.
[01:49:38.725 --> 01:49:39.005]  dollar.
[01:49:39.025 --> 01:49:42.087]  You've got to get out of these markets and buy something that's solid and secure.
[01:49:42.607 --> 01:49:45.288]  And gold and silver, there's nothing that meets that match.
[01:49:45.348 --> 01:49:46.168]  That is it.
[01:49:47.829 --> 01:49:49.590]  Ted, give folks the toll-free number.
[01:49:49.810 --> 01:49:50.090]  Yeah, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:54.660]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:50:01.346]  And again, I stress, get physical delivery of gold.
[01:50:01.406 --> 01:50:03.268]  Don't be buying paper contracts.
[01:50:03.408 --> 01:50:04.729]  Get the physical stuff.
[01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:10.094]  Now, Ted, what about those InfoWars.com links and PrisonPlanet.com links you sponsor us?
[01:50:10.455 --> 01:50:12.617]  We'll have links over to whatever the day's special is.
[01:50:12.957 --> 01:50:13.918]  What are the specials there?
[01:50:14.578 --> 01:50:16.159]  You know, Alex, I haven't had a chance.
[01:50:16.179 --> 01:50:18.061]  I've been so busy taking care of this, I didn't even look.
[01:50:18.121 --> 01:50:25.686]  But I would suggest that you make the phone call, because the stuff that you have right here that I'm talking about on the air right now, you're not going to get it anywhere else.
[01:50:25.946 --> 01:50:33.251]  You're not even going to get it here at my company if you don't mention the fact that you called in, heard it on the Alex Jones Show, and you want to get the special.
[01:50:33.572 --> 01:50:35.113]  Ted, how long can you hold this?
[01:50:35.153 --> 01:50:36.093]  What's your supply like?
[01:50:36.194 --> 01:50:42.118]  Well, unless if I see gold drop about $100 an ounce today, I won't be able to offer it tomorrow.
[01:50:42.218 --> 01:50:43.359]  My prices will be up tomorrow.
[01:50:44.232 --> 01:50:47.613]  So, 800-686-2237.
[01:50:48.194 --> 01:50:48.854]  Get gold.
[01:50:49.154 --> 01:50:50.215]  Where is gold right now?
[01:50:50.235 --> 01:50:51.735]  It keeps going up every time I look.
[01:50:51.935 --> 01:50:56.417]  Well, you know, I mean, I only, I don't have a computer right here in my studio, and I'm looking.
[01:50:56.437 --> 01:50:59.338]  The last time I looked, it was up $82.22.
[01:50:59.579 --> 01:51:01.820]  Ask on Gold was $8.62.10.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:05.341]  So, it is up, you know, $82.
[01:51:05.441 --> 01:51:05.981]  My gosh!
[01:51:06.381 --> 01:51:10.663]  I mean, it started out at about $800, and it just kept on climbing.
[01:51:10.723 --> 01:51:12.144]  It's like a runaway train right now.
[01:51:13.502 --> 01:51:14.463]  The dollar's dropping.
[01:51:14.483 --> 01:51:20.567]  The dollar, well, I'm looking at it right now, the dollar is down 76.20 from 78.
[01:51:21.028 --> 01:51:23.510]  You know, the whole thing.
[01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:30.555]  Well, they pumped up the dollar and drove down commodities right before they fully devalued the dollar.
[01:51:30.815 --> 01:51:34.178]  And for those who don't know, conservatively tens of trillions
[01:51:35.178 --> 01:51:36.819]  Definitely in the hundreds of trillions.
[01:51:36.959 --> 01:51:38.360]  I mean, because so much of it's secret.
[01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:42.082]  But they're admitting 50-something trillion with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:51:42.582 --> 01:51:44.903]  Hundreds of billions every day at other bailouts.
[01:51:45.283 --> 01:51:51.107]  And then they admit that, well, this company's 50 billion in the hole, this one's 87 billion, this one's 5 trillion.
[01:51:51.347 --> 01:51:54.548]  But they admit that these companies are leveraged hundreds of times.
[01:51:54.969 --> 01:51:55.989]  Well, that's the thing, Alex.
[01:51:56.029 --> 01:51:57.670]  Right now we're just scratching the surface.
[01:51:57.710 --> 01:51:59.371]  We're hearing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and
[01:51:59.851 --> 01:52:06.353]  And now, Lehman Brothers, there's a whole list of institutions right now that are right on the verge of filing bankruptcy.
[01:52:06.473 --> 01:52:12.155]  Let me tell people, gold is up $85.50 today and shooting straight up as we speak.
[01:52:12.675 --> 01:52:15.296]  It has not dropped since gold opened this morning.
[01:52:15.956 --> 01:52:18.238]  It is shooting straight up.
[01:52:18.418 --> 01:52:27.344]  It's definitely going to limit up today, and I can't guarantee what it will do tomorrow, but there is too many financial problems out there right now.
[01:52:27.384 --> 01:52:29.165]  You've just got to take a look at what's going on.
[01:52:29.585 --> 01:52:31.747]  Ted, we were talking about being scared a few months ago.
[01:52:32.127 --> 01:52:36.210]  I mean, I personally don't have that much money, but I have some savings accounts for my children.
[01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:38.332]  And I'm like, what do I do with this?
[01:52:38.392 --> 01:52:41.856]  I mean, because I'm not even in the mode of holding physical gold.
[01:52:41.876 --> 01:52:42.657]  I don't even hold that much.
[01:52:42.677 --> 01:52:43.458]  I don't have that much money.
[01:52:43.818 --> 01:52:46.181]  And it's kind of like, I'm not into buying things.
[01:52:47.002 --> 01:52:51.287]  But I've gotten to the point now, my wife's like, you preach this stuff, come on, do something!
[01:52:51.808 --> 01:52:54.131]  And you know, we're all, I mean, my dad's in the same position.
[01:52:55.272 --> 01:52:59.134]  I don't have time to go look at property, but it's going to go down in value, too.
[01:52:59.555 --> 01:53:03.358]  But you've got to be in something physical, and the best bet is gold and silver.
[01:53:03.378 --> 01:53:03.678]  800-686-2237.
[01:53:03.798 --> 01:53:07.961]  Ted Anderson, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:09.542]  Hey, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[01:53:09.622 --> 01:53:10.283]  I really appreciate it.
[01:53:10.563 --> 01:53:11.144]  You bet.
[01:53:12.725 --> 01:53:15.006]  People are crazy if they don't take that offer, but hey, whatever.
[01:53:15.127 --> 01:53:16.828]  Gold at 85% below spot.
[01:53:18.729 --> 01:53:21.011]  And Ted is in danger with that deal.
[01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:31.174]  I was talking to him during the break, he told me some of what he's got, and it's going to run out fast, but he says he will honor whatever, because he can just buy it at more money and ship it to you.
[01:53:31.534 --> 01:53:41.040]  But what he's got in the safe right now, first come, first served, people will be there until about 10 o'clock tonight, 800-686-2237 is the toll free number to call.
[01:53:41.060 --> 01:53:42.881]  800-686-2237.
[01:53:44.182 --> 01:53:47.864]  That's the gold number, isn't it?
[01:53:48.444 --> 01:53:51.066]  I've got so much going on in my brain, I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:53:53.866 --> 01:53:56.847]  I got all this economic news and I just covered that with Ted.
[01:53:56.887 --> 01:54:00.067]  Let me get into some other news for you.
[01:54:01.728 --> 01:54:02.908]  Because I want to go to these phone calls.
[01:54:02.948 --> 01:54:07.509]  I want to go to the loaded phone lines here.
[01:54:09.489 --> 01:54:10.949]  Should I go to phone calls now?
[01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:13.370]  And then hold it to the end?
[01:54:15.810 --> 01:54:17.111]  What should I do here?
[01:54:22.352 --> 01:54:23.372]  I have so many here.
[01:54:24.622 --> 01:54:25.963]  I mean, this is the type of news I have.
[01:54:26.003 --> 01:54:27.643]  This is what I could spend the rest of the hour on, but I'm not.
[01:54:27.663 --> 01:54:28.484]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:54:29.004 --> 01:54:34.266]  Melissa, Ben, Mark, Motto, JC, Chip, Lucas, Charles, Bruce, Chris, George, and others.
[01:54:35.967 --> 01:54:39.168]  YouTube's version of the Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act.
[01:54:40.208 --> 01:54:41.609]  And it is absolutely true.
[01:54:41.789 --> 01:54:43.010]  I couldn't believe it yesterday.
[01:54:43.650 --> 01:54:45.931]  And sure enough, they have implemented it before it's even law.
[01:54:46.914 --> 01:54:54.139]  And it states in the Prevention Act that 9-11 Truth is basically terrorist, and that it needs to be banned.
[01:54:54.999 --> 01:54:57.261]  Now, you tell me we're not having an effect on them.
[01:54:57.521 --> 01:54:59.442]  If something isn't hurting them, they let it continue.
[01:55:00.963 --> 01:55:02.644]  So, I've got that.
[01:55:02.684 --> 01:55:05.466]  Also, Arctic ice sheet melt season officially over.
[01:55:06.127 --> 01:55:09.209]  Ice cap up to nine percent larger than from last year.
[01:55:09.729 --> 01:55:10.550]  That's official.
[01:55:10.630 --> 01:55:13.512]  Multiple governments, multiple satellite photos,
[01:55:14.252 --> 01:55:21.575]  But then the UN News Center reports, global network necessary to confront climate change's crisis says ban.
[01:55:22.275 --> 01:55:31.399]  And it says the UN says they need basically a world government to enforce rules on stopping global warming, which means taxing carbon dioxide that animals exhale.
[01:55:32.539 --> 01:55:35.480]  Authorities vowed to force holdouts off Texas coast.
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:36.921]  People that stayed are being forced out.
[01:55:40.492 --> 01:55:44.314]  Patient contracts Hepatitis C from dialysis center.
[01:55:44.334 --> 01:55:45.735]  They think up to 700 could have it.
[01:55:46.455 --> 01:55:50.698]  But Bayer ships out HIV to a million people on purpose and vaccines doesn't get in trouble.
[01:55:51.578 --> 01:55:58.522]  Dick Arne says that Dick Cheney BS'd him about Iraq mini-nukes and a lot more.
[01:55:58.542 --> 01:55:59.003]  Stay with us.
[01:56:01.824 --> 01:56:04.266]  On September 11, 2001... You know what?
[01:56:04.326 --> 01:56:05.206]  Let's just skip the break.
[01:56:07.222 --> 01:56:08.663]  Those guys ever bring me a water?
[01:56:08.903 --> 01:56:11.964]  See, I'm kind of stuck in here, and I asked them for a water over and over again.
[01:56:11.984 --> 01:56:15.225]  I just asked them to get it, because they need to learn to remember.
[01:56:16.606 --> 01:56:18.787]  It's no big deal, but I'm like a Chinese princess.
[01:56:18.827 --> 01:56:22.528]  You know, they had the long nails and the feet and the little shoes so they couldn't walk.
[01:56:23.148 --> 01:56:29.431]  The power behind the throne learned how to domesticate the royals through styles.
[01:56:30.259 --> 01:56:35.422]  Until the Royals were literally like these queen ants or queen bees that couldn't move.
[01:56:35.482 --> 01:56:36.563]  Everything had to be brought to them.
[01:56:37.163 --> 01:56:37.963]  And I'm the same way.
[01:56:37.983 --> 01:56:44.867]  When I skip these breaks and do business, you know, and phone calls and research behind the breaks, I'm stuck in here.
[01:56:45.488 --> 01:56:47.229]  And then I rely on people to bring me stuff.
[01:56:47.609 --> 01:56:50.470]  Let's go ahead and start going to calls and I'll get into all this YouTube stuff later.
[01:56:51.551 --> 01:56:54.272]  Let's go to Melissa in North Carolina first.
[01:56:54.312 --> 01:56:54.933]  Go ahead, Melissa.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:58.101]  Hey Alex, thank you for your calls.
[01:56:58.341 --> 01:57:00.801]  Thank you for all the information you give us and educate us.
[01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.762]  I was just curious.
[01:57:02.842 --> 01:57:04.802]  I want to help you too to get the word out.
[01:57:04.822 --> 01:57:06.303]  You're only one person.
[01:57:07.023 --> 01:57:15.965]  When I hear other radios and television and people talking about elections and everything that's going on, I get so upset with all the knowledge that you've given me.
[01:57:17.045 --> 01:57:23.187]  You've hit on today about protecting your family and you've been threatened.
[01:57:24.402 --> 01:57:30.747]  How do you protect your family when you touch on all these subjects and get all this information out?
[01:57:30.847 --> 01:57:33.789]  How am I supposed to go about doing this properly?
[01:57:33.809 --> 01:57:37.192]  Well, you have to understand that little people, they don't tend to target.
[01:57:37.652 --> 01:57:39.453]  Unless it's a local boss hog type.
[01:57:39.813 --> 01:57:42.836]  You know, that person putting their head up, I better teach him to learn!
[01:57:43.396 --> 01:57:45.337]  You know, there's kind of that attitude and it's real dangerous.
[01:57:45.878 --> 01:57:49.220]  I'm a big fish in all of this, as big as it gets in this movement.
[01:57:50.841 --> 01:57:57.165]  I'm not saying I'm an icon, I'm saying I'm an icon within this movement, which is becoming an icon itself, or more than an icon.
[01:57:58.066 --> 01:57:59.226]  And so I get a lot of the heat.
[01:57:59.306 --> 01:58:02.589]  And they haven't killed me because they don't want to give what I've said attention.
[01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:05.951]  They don't want to underline it, put an exclamation point on it, highlight it.
[01:58:06.491 --> 01:58:10.034]  You know, I have firearms and incidental pistol safes in my house.
[01:58:10.434 --> 01:58:11.255]  I lock my doors.
[01:58:11.355 --> 01:58:12.156]  I watch my back.
[01:58:12.596 --> 01:58:15.058]  But not out of fear, only so I can continue my work.
[01:58:15.939 --> 01:58:17.780]  But really, I leave it up to God, mostly.
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:18.761]  I don't live in fear.
[01:58:18.821 --> 01:58:19.381]  I'm committed.
[01:58:19.401 --> 01:58:21.023]  I just don't worry about it.
[01:58:22.264 --> 01:58:23.344]  It's all part of the adventure.
[01:58:24.985 --> 01:58:27.486]  And everybody in my family is going to die one day anyways.
[01:58:27.566 --> 01:58:28.127]  I don't want them to die.
[01:58:28.147 --> 01:58:29.547]  I want them to live long, healthy lives.
[01:58:30.527 --> 01:58:32.888]  But I'm not going to give in to fear.
[01:58:33.168 --> 01:58:36.370]  Well, you better fear for your little girl if we don't win.
[01:58:36.810 --> 01:58:39.011]  I mean, look, I've got hundreds of articles that are so big.
[01:58:39.351 --> 01:58:43.232]  Every immigrant to this country, they always beta test on them while claiming they care about them.
[01:58:43.752 --> 01:58:47.814]  Every immigrant that is coming to this country
[01:58:49.511 --> 01:58:56.695]  Every single one of them is being forced to take the HPV Gardasil shot they admit kills people with a live cancer virus.
[01:58:56.955 --> 01:58:58.416]  Now that was in the news yesterday.
[01:58:58.776 --> 01:58:59.696]  None of us are safe.
[01:58:59.716 --> 01:59:01.937]  They're not going to stop until we resist.
[01:59:02.138 --> 01:59:02.578]  Period.
[01:59:02.858 --> 01:59:04.479]  And so you're safer fighting back.
[01:59:05.519 --> 01:59:05.799]  Right.
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:14.124]  With the vaccines, I didn't know if I had to hire an attorney for religious exemptions or there really is no mandatory law that you have to take vaccines.
[01:59:14.504 --> 01:59:15.565]  Here's how the fraud works.
[01:59:18.064 --> 01:59:19.624]  You've never heard me explain this on air?
[01:59:20.125 --> 01:59:20.625]  No, sir.
[01:59:20.685 --> 01:59:24.906]  I'm just now joining with you and gosh, it disrupts my life every day.
[01:59:24.926 --> 01:59:29.407]  My husband says I can't function because I'm so obsessed with what I'm learning from you.
[01:59:30.847 --> 01:59:32.408]  Well, it'll definitely take you over.
[01:59:32.448 --> 01:59:37.049]  Reality will, once you realize, once you come out of the Egypt, once you come out of the false reality.
[01:59:37.429 --> 01:59:40.450]  Look, everything's done through color of law fraud.
[01:59:43.621 --> 01:59:44.381]  Did we just lose her?
[01:59:44.862 --> 01:59:45.542]  Yes, sir, I'm here.
[01:59:45.562 --> 01:59:46.462]  Okay, I just heard a big click.
[01:59:47.263 --> 01:59:50.164]  Tell you what, let's just come back to the full audience and answer the question.
[01:59:50.184 --> 01:59:52.345]  The problem is I'll never get to all these callers if these are long questions.
[01:59:52.385 --> 01:59:55.027]  Right, how do I protect my life and the vaccines?
[01:59:55.167 --> 01:59:56.107]  No, no, I understand, ma'am.
[01:59:56.127 --> 01:59:56.487]  Here we go.
[01:59:56.567 --> 01:59:56.888]  Here we go.
[01:59:58.028 --> 01:59:59.429]  USA.org today.
[02:00:03.031 --> 02:00:05.652]  Okay, Melissa in North Carolina.
[02:00:07.130 --> 02:00:09.531]  During the behind-the-scenes InfoWars.com streams.
[02:00:09.891 --> 02:00:16.875]  By the way, we're on AM and FM stations, shortwave satellite, but hundreds of thousands of people a day tune in via the streams.
[02:00:17.896 --> 02:00:20.797]  I have my separate own streams at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:21.137 --> 02:00:24.199]  That's how you hear the behind-the-scenes discussions is by going there and clicking.
[02:00:24.499 --> 02:00:27.101]  Those were down for about 30 minutes or 20 minutes this morning.
[02:00:28.090 --> 02:00:32.851]  And so people are going to miss the behind-the-scenes discussions if you don't go over those streams.
[02:00:33.971 --> 02:00:44.974]  Also, when the show ends and the rebroadcast starts and I go through what we believe to be the murder of Barry Jennings, a key 9-11 witness, all the details were covered in the first hour and a bunch of other key news.
[02:00:44.994 --> 02:00:48.914]  You won't be able to hear that unless you're listening to those streams.
[02:00:49.355 --> 02:00:52.275]  So that's all at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:53.635 --> 02:00:55.936]  Melissa had asked the question about
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:01:00.346]  How does she protect herself?
[02:01:00.587 --> 02:01:03.111]  Is it really not a law that she has to take vaccines?
[02:01:05.135 --> 02:01:08.581]  Is there a law that you've got to have an abortion, Melissa?
[02:01:09.742 --> 02:01:10.022]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:27.637 --> 02:01:44.407]  Now, do you remember, uh, last school year started, I had the Prince George County State Attorney on, and he admitted his children don't vaccinate, but they had police dogs out, 2,000 children and their parents, were told it was the law, they had to take vaccines, and they showed up with police dogs barking and growling, and took the shots.
[02:01:44.507 --> 02:01:47.328]  But then I had him on, and I said, there's no law, and he said, no there's not.
[02:01:47.909 --> 02:01:49.329]  So that shows the government.
[02:01:49.429 --> 02:01:50.070]  It's criminal.
[02:01:51.556 --> 02:01:55.839]  And so they lie and they say, you won't be allowed to be in school, you'll be arrested.
[02:01:55.899 --> 02:02:07.266]  But what they do is they suspend you for not having, your child, for not having the shots, then truancy kicks in, but under federal and state law they can't do that for something that isn't against the law.
[02:02:07.326 --> 02:02:15.051]  They say it's school policy, so then they expel you, then they trigger truancy, and then they come arrest you for that.
[02:02:15.491 --> 02:02:19.294]  And then they call it out of law, because you're ignorant, it's for your own good, they say,
[02:02:20.054 --> 02:02:27.537]  Give your kids shots and we'll drop the charges and then you get the shots, they let you back in school and now your kid's just on probation.
[02:02:28.157 --> 02:02:30.578]  Let me finish here, how the fraud works.
[02:02:31.618 --> 02:02:41.022]  Then, when they're introducing a crime, a mass crime operation on us, they get you to contract your rights away.
[02:02:41.042 --> 02:02:41.662]  So they announce
[02:02:43.049 --> 02:02:46.450]  For those that do know it's not the law, we want you to sign a waiver form.
[02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:53.872]  And most waiver forms say, I admit I'm a bad parent, I admit I'm putting them in danger, but it's my conscientious objector or religious right to do this.
[02:02:54.332 --> 02:02:56.692]  But there's no triggering law to make you do that.
[02:02:56.732 --> 02:03:00.773]  The parents I know just threaten to sue them and say, look, that's a fraud as well.
[02:03:00.813 --> 02:03:01.873]  I'm not signing a form.
[02:03:01.913 --> 02:03:04.174]  There's no law triggering that health department.
[02:03:04.314 --> 02:03:05.174]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:03:05.934 --> 02:03:08.255]  It's the same thing with the HPV shot.
[02:03:09.468 --> 02:03:13.490]  There's no law, as they announced in Texas, it's the law, you've got to take the shot.
[02:03:14.490 --> 02:03:15.131]  There's no law.
[02:03:16.011 --> 02:03:16.612]  There's no law.
[02:03:17.652 --> 02:03:23.695]  The health department got a mandate from the governor to make it their list of mandatory recommended.
[02:03:24.375 --> 02:03:25.616]  See, it's all lawyer speak.
[02:03:26.436 --> 02:03:29.538]  Mandatory recommended.
[02:03:30.984 --> 02:03:41.247]  Then they run a giant hoax on the cattle drooling population, drunk on fluoride and aspartame, that the governor says you have to take it.
[02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:44.868]  Then the feds say all the immigrants have to take it.
[02:03:48.389 --> 02:03:50.329]  I'd love to talk to you all day, but I've got to get to all the calls here.
[02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:52.290]  I gave her like six, seven minutes.
[02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:55.131]  I've got to give people less time because I've got to get to all the points.
[02:03:55.948 --> 02:04:02.550]  Ma'am, I've asked my webmasters, Curt Nimmo and Paul Watson, I think they created sections and they get buried because there's so much new news every day.
[02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:11.473]  We need permanent vaccine center on the site that has the state exemption forms first, but even that's bad because it introduces you into the fraud of having to get a waiver.
[02:04:13.253 --> 02:04:15.974]  See, it's a waiver to a law that doesn't exist.
[02:04:15.994 --> 02:04:17.515]  See, right there, the government's rogue.
[02:04:17.575 --> 02:04:18.035]  It's criminal.
[02:04:20.495 --> 02:04:21.876]  Ben in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:04:23.294 --> 02:04:24.215]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:04:24.635 --> 02:04:30.441]  I just wanted to point out that I know one of the vortices of this 9-11 truth movement is dead sort of thing.
[02:04:30.561 --> 02:04:43.833]  If you go to the latest issue of Skeptics Magazine, they've got an article in there talking about how since loose change has dropped in viewing, which we already know that's manipulated, then that means that the whole movement is dead.
[02:04:44.204 --> 02:04:51.165]  If we can get enough letters sent in to Skeptics Magazine saying, this is a fraud, this is BS, we can't have... Oh, screw them!
[02:04:51.205 --> 02:05:00.107]  Nobody pays attention to that pathetic Cider Scopes, Urban Legends, that says there's no such thing as cross-species chimeras.
[02:05:00.187 --> 02:05:07.909]  I mean, you know, let them say that there's no such thing as the sun, or no such thing as a dog, or no such thing as Chinese selling political dissidence organs.
[02:05:08.289 --> 02:05:09.189]  But that's my point!
[02:05:09.269 --> 02:05:10.009]  They're all
[02:05:10.589 --> 02:05:16.393]  The government ops and our quote, own people are all saying it right when Valhalla is here.
[02:05:17.333 --> 02:05:21.396]  And I'm telling you, whoever says that is a fed or is under their control.
[02:05:21.496 --> 02:05:21.936]  Period.
[02:05:22.376 --> 02:05:22.957]  Anything else?
[02:05:23.877 --> 02:05:29.861]  I just wanted to say that to elicit all the rest of these people who are still afraid, you can't let the fear paralyze you.
[02:05:29.901 --> 02:05:31.922]  You've got to get out there and you've got to be a bulldog.
[02:05:32.302 --> 02:05:34.344]  Be polite, but don't back down.
[02:05:34.644 --> 02:05:35.324]  That's the key.
[02:05:35.544 --> 02:05:36.605]  Oh, hey, we don't have a hope.
[02:05:36.665 --> 02:05:37.666]  All you can do is fight.
[02:05:38.459 --> 02:05:38.919]  That's right.
[02:05:38.999 --> 02:05:41.900]  It's a good feeling to be cornered, because then you know there's nothing you can do but fight.
[02:05:42.781 --> 02:05:43.221]  Exactly.
[02:05:43.241 --> 02:05:43.941]  Thank you for the call.
[02:05:43.961 --> 02:05:48.643]  We're going to continue with phone calls behind the scenes for the InfoWars.com stream listeners exclusively.
[02:05:48.663 --> 02:05:51.224]  For everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes with more key news straight ahead.
[02:05:51.725 --> 02:05:52.485]  We're on the mark.
[02:05:53.445 --> 02:05:55.166]  Okay, let's continue with the calls here.
[02:05:56.667 --> 02:06:02.269]  Let's go ahead, and remember folks, you've got to go from the Genesis streams over to the InfoWars streams to listen here, but obviously you know that because you can hear it.
[02:06:03.169 --> 02:06:04.110]  Let's go ahead and
[02:06:06.749 --> 02:06:09.670]  Let's go ahead and talk to the Genesis Board.
[02:06:10.290 --> 02:06:12.351]  I've only been taking calls off my board.
[02:06:12.651 --> 02:06:14.012]  Let's talk to Lucas in Texas.
[02:06:14.032 --> 02:06:14.872]  You're on the air, Lucas.
[02:06:17.854 --> 02:06:19.374]  Hey, can you take a call there, John?
[02:06:19.394 --> 02:06:20.775]  Yeah, Lucas dropped off.
[02:06:20.975 --> 02:06:22.015]  Oh, Lucas dropped off.
[02:06:22.115 --> 02:06:23.816]  Charles in California, go ahead.
[02:06:25.637 --> 02:06:30.259]  Give me a big favor and turn your radio off.
[02:06:31.699 --> 02:06:32.100]  Yeah, hi.
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:32.980]  Hi, go ahead.
[02:06:34.193 --> 02:06:42.360]  I just appreciate everything you do, and I just wanted to talk about how I wanted to ask you how I could get that gold again, if I could get that number.
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:43.340]  800-686-2237.
[02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:48.304]  Alright, and that's $90?
[02:06:48.384 --> 02:06:49.605]  That's from yesterday's price?
[02:06:50.266 --> 02:06:54.469]  That's like $85, going towards $90 less than, yeah, than it is now.
[02:06:55.150 --> 02:06:58.593]  Alright, once again, I'd like to echo that I appreciate everything you do.
[02:06:58.653 --> 02:07:01.795]  I got the Ecolo Blue system coming today.
[02:07:01.815 --> 02:07:02.596]  I hope that's good.
[02:07:03.924 --> 02:07:06.086]  That's what we do, is keep our little bottles here.
[02:07:06.506 --> 02:07:08.587]  We got Berkey's, those, they all work real good.
[02:07:08.627 --> 02:07:11.649]  The Cola Blue takes it right out of the air, you just gotta keep it clean.
[02:07:11.789 --> 02:07:12.910]  But it's really good.
[02:07:13.550 --> 02:07:14.350]  It's coming today.
[02:07:15.971 --> 02:07:32.141]  But also, just want to talk about, you know, I've been listening to you for a few years now, more and more every day now, but I was still showering in the fluoride, you know, brushing my teeth with the fluoride, being in denial, you know, typical sheep.
[02:07:32.884 --> 02:07:41.366]  But now, uh, I don't know, I'm just not being silent anymore, letting every neighbor know about everything, everyone in my family, even though they're pretty dumbed down.
[02:07:42.106 --> 02:07:43.427]  It's from New Jersey.
[02:07:43.487 --> 02:07:45.407]  Yeah, the truth movement is exploding.
[02:07:45.427 --> 02:07:47.508]  The truth about the New World Order, that's all it is.
[02:07:47.788 --> 02:07:53.189]  People talking to neighbors, people confronting the media, confronting politicians in these New World Order whores.
[02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:54.070]  It's beautiful!
[02:07:54.330 --> 02:07:58.371]  And how dare anyone who claims they're part of our movement tell us it's dead?
[02:07:58.911 --> 02:08:00.531]  They're feds, period.
[02:08:00.572 --> 02:08:04.213]  You shouldn't even be giving them attention for saying that.
[02:08:04.293 --> 02:08:05.433]  No, no, no.
[02:08:05.473 --> 02:08:06.673]  I'm not giving them attention.
[02:08:06.753 --> 02:08:14.396]  I'm letting listeners know who may not be sophisticated enough because I hadn't really been paying attention and I noticed it when I'd see one and go, what an idiot or what a fool.
[02:08:14.816 --> 02:08:20.777]  I can't imagine that there's that many listeners you have that listen to you all the time that aren't, you know, very well sophisticated at this point.
[02:08:20.797 --> 02:08:22.558]  Well, the point is we need to get out and tell other people.
[02:08:23.138 --> 02:08:23.818]  It's bigger than ever.
[02:08:23.898 --> 02:08:29.501]  And Cindy Sheehan, I don't know, can I help support her being anywhere in California?
[02:08:30.061 --> 02:08:30.642]  Absolutely.
[02:08:31.482 --> 02:08:31.762]  Really?
[02:08:32.002 --> 02:08:33.803]  Monetarily, you can support her anywhere in the country.
[02:08:34.864 --> 02:08:35.924]  Alright, nice.
[02:08:35.944 --> 02:08:36.685]  Not for sure.
[02:08:36.725 --> 02:08:40.927]  No, I mean, get her into, you know... No, you can only vote if you're in that district.
[02:08:40.947 --> 02:08:42.067]  I appreciate your call.
[02:08:42.267 --> 02:08:44.348]  Go to her website and find out more about it.
[02:08:44.388 --> 02:08:45.329]  We're going to come back to the full audience.
[02:08:45.349 --> 02:08:47.190]  I've got to really move fast now because I've got to get into this.
[02:08:48.210 --> 02:08:49.991]  Every one of these articles is earth shattering.
[02:08:50.051 --> 02:08:51.952]  I mean, you ought to see the stuff in the stack.
[02:08:54.076 --> 02:08:59.160]  It's just, this morning I was so excited to get on air, so much I wanted to cover, and I'm just frustrated.
[02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:00.501]  I covered some of it, but not all of it.
[02:09:01.302 --> 02:09:04.504]  There's so much proof on every point, every fact, and I can't go through all of it.
[02:09:04.544 --> 02:09:08.247]  It's just... God, and the government's so evil, it's so hard to believe.
[02:09:08.287 --> 02:09:08.667]  Here we go.
[02:09:11.589 --> 02:09:12.230]  Okay, here's the deal.
[02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:15.933]  I got a bunch of news I need to cover, and I want to take your calls, so let's just race through your calls.
[02:09:16.033 --> 02:09:17.053]  Bruce in Connecticut.
[02:09:17.494 --> 02:09:18.435]  Bruce, you're on the air.
[02:09:18.475 --> 02:09:18.895]  Go ahead.
[02:09:20.196 --> 02:09:20.416]  Hello.
[02:09:20.736 --> 02:09:21.017]  Hi.
[02:09:22.618 --> 02:09:22.778]  Hello?
[02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:24.070]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:24.170 --> 02:09:25.771]  You're on the air, Bruce.
[02:09:26.312 --> 02:09:28.053]  Hey, thanks, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:09:28.733 --> 02:09:40.440]  Initially, I was going to call and plug you and all your guests for telling me a lot of the truth, and all the listeners have to do is do some research when you hear some facts that you guys spit out and verify that you are telling the truth.
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:43.402]  But I want to get back to your show yesterday.
[02:09:43.982 --> 02:09:50.326]  Paul Craig Roberts said that these guys who are off showing jobs didn't realize the financial outcome.
[02:09:51.301 --> 02:09:51.881]  I don't buy that.
[02:09:52.041 --> 02:09:52.701]  Oh, no, they knew.
[02:09:52.761 --> 02:09:57.723]  In fact, in a lot of globalist documents, they say they were going to do this ten, twenty years ago.
[02:09:57.803 --> 02:09:58.323]  They've done it.
[02:09:58.383 --> 02:09:59.523]  I mean, it's in black and white.
[02:10:00.003 --> 02:10:01.204]  That's Economics 101.
[02:10:02.004 --> 02:10:02.824]  That's what banks do.
[02:10:02.864 --> 02:10:06.205]  They want to get you overextended and then pull the rug out from under.
[02:10:06.985 --> 02:10:08.146]  I mean, it's obvious.
[02:10:08.606 --> 02:10:11.667]  I don't know if he's naive or he's playing the other side.
[02:10:11.707 --> 02:10:12.107]  I don't know.
[02:10:12.347 --> 02:10:12.907]  I don't think so.
[02:10:12.947 --> 02:10:14.968]  He's pretty hardcore on the police state and stuff now.
[02:10:15.748 --> 02:10:17.528]  He just finds it hard to believe they're this evil.
[02:10:18.729 --> 02:10:19.489]  Anything else, Bruce?
[02:10:20.276 --> 02:10:25.680]  No, I had a whole spiel to plug you and your guests, but I know you've got a lot of quality, so I'll let you go.
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:26.861]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:10:29.162 --> 02:10:30.383]  Yeah, it's making the enemy mad.
[02:10:30.423 --> 02:10:31.944]  What a big effect my listeners are having.
[02:10:31.984 --> 02:10:33.345]  How much action you're taking out there.
[02:10:33.385 --> 02:10:34.706]  Just make them even more mad.
[02:10:34.746 --> 02:10:36.808]  But don't do it for hatred of the New World Order.
[02:10:37.308 --> 02:10:39.630]  Fight for the innocents that are counting on you to come through.
[02:10:39.650 --> 02:10:41.091]  We're going to make it through this with God's help.
[02:10:42.253 --> 02:10:48.899]  By God, I salute everybody at 9-11 Truth, and all the patriots that exposed the North American Union, and anybody and everybody that gets up off their butt.
[02:10:48.919 --> 02:10:52.562]  I mean, how dare people sit there and second-guess those that are taking action?
[02:10:52.582 --> 02:11:00.149]  But they do that to make you question, and to make you second-guess yourself, and to make you kind of stand still for a minute so they can run over you.
[02:11:00.349 --> 02:11:01.870]  You're going to fail New World Order.
[02:11:02.150 --> 02:11:04.833]  We see right through you, and we know we're kicking your butt.
[02:11:04.853 --> 02:11:06.054]  We're going to intensify things.
[02:11:07.822 --> 02:11:08.442]  You failed.
[02:11:08.482 --> 02:11:09.203]  How do you like that?
[02:11:09.223 --> 02:11:10.063]  Because you're failures.
[02:11:10.563 --> 02:11:12.944]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Illinois.
[02:11:12.984 --> 02:11:13.364]  Go ahead.
[02:11:13.384 --> 02:11:14.445]  Hi Alex.
[02:11:15.045 --> 02:11:16.026]  Hi.
[02:11:16.606 --> 02:11:17.486]  Great to be on the show.
[02:11:17.566 --> 02:11:18.286]  Long time fan.
[02:11:18.326 --> 02:11:19.847]  First time caller.
[02:11:20.627 --> 02:11:22.428]  Just talk about Ted's gold deal.
[02:11:22.468 --> 02:11:23.189]  It's phenomenal.
[02:11:24.549 --> 02:11:28.651]  I've seen other websites buying his coins for more, $20 more than he's selling them for.
[02:11:30.143 --> 02:11:31.043]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:11:31.083 --> 02:11:32.324]  Are you recording this phone call?
[02:11:33.124 --> 02:11:34.825]  No, I'm just on a wireless phone.
[02:11:35.125 --> 02:11:37.045]  Okay, well, I think it's about to go out of power.
[02:11:37.565 --> 02:11:42.487]  Yeah, no, I mean, Ted is offering gold at 85% under what it's selling for today.
[02:11:42.507 --> 02:11:44.388]  I mean, he's never done a deal like this.
[02:11:44.468 --> 02:11:45.088]  It's not hype.
[02:11:46.188 --> 02:11:47.529]  I believe in these investments.
[02:11:47.609 --> 02:11:51.270]  It's what I'm invested in, and it's totally insane.
[02:11:52.810 --> 02:11:53.911]  One other quick thing, if I could.
[02:11:55.391 --> 02:11:57.892]  A long time ago, when Timothy McVeigh was put to death,
[02:11:58.317 --> 02:12:04.980]  I remember hearing a story on the radio, I only heard it once, that he wrote 9-11 on his chest when they found his body and did the post-mortem.
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.341]  Did you ever hear anything like that?
[02:12:06.641 --> 02:12:06.941]  Yes.
[02:12:08.482 --> 02:12:17.146]  I mean, hell, the governor's brother wrote a book the year before the attacks where a Tom McVeigh bombs the Alfred P. Murrah building, and then everything that happened was accurate.
[02:12:20.126 --> 02:12:21.547]  I mean, my God, these people love it.
[02:12:21.587 --> 02:12:24.909]  I mean, they make TV shows where they carry out 9-11 over and over again.
[02:12:25.349 --> 02:12:26.249]  I appreciate your call.
[02:12:26.289 --> 02:12:27.610]  I'm going to jump again so we can get to everybody.
[02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:29.831]  George in Illinois, you're on the air.
[02:12:30.992 --> 02:12:32.593]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:12:32.633 --> 02:12:33.113]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:33.853 --> 02:12:44.399]  You know, the thing is, just watching your films and just looking at the Minnesota Convention, you know what really scares me is these police officers have that stoned face and they got no soul.
[02:12:45.103 --> 02:12:47.704]  I mean, they've been like, something that's taken over, like the board.
[02:12:47.864 --> 02:12:57.469]  Well, they've been taught that that's tough, and not asking questions, but it'll be tough when the government takes their entire pension fund and everybody else's pension fund.
[02:12:57.509 --> 02:13:01.330]  So, you know, hey, you think Darth Vader outfits are fun?
[02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:03.031]  Well, this isn't a movie.
[02:13:03.651 --> 02:13:05.332]  And, you know, you're going to find out.
[02:13:06.072 --> 02:13:07.333]  Well, you know the sad thing?
[02:13:07.573 --> 02:13:13.896]  When this thing goes down, the people who gave the order to politicians, the police chief, they'll be on a learjet, and they're going to be a lead cushion.
[02:13:14.431 --> 02:13:15.312]  For the angry mobs.
[02:13:17.033 --> 02:13:17.534]  That's right.
[02:13:18.535 --> 02:13:21.457]  But that's what they want, so this is what they want, this is what they get.
[02:13:22.698 --> 02:13:23.759]  Alright, God bless you, Alex.
[02:13:23.839 --> 02:13:24.540]  Keep up the good work.
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:24.820]  You bet.
[02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:25.540]  Thank you, George.
[02:13:25.981 --> 02:13:27.382]  Lucas just hung up.
[02:13:27.462 --> 02:13:28.763]  Brian in Arizona.
[02:13:28.783 --> 02:13:29.524]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:13:30.565 --> 02:13:31.105]  Alex, how are you?
[02:13:31.405 --> 02:13:31.646]  Hello.
[02:13:31.986 --> 02:13:32.406]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:33.227 --> 02:13:37.471]  Oh, I wondered, you were talking, I heard the subject was economy in 9-11.
[02:13:37.731 --> 02:13:41.254]  If you go to a movie called The Truth and Lies of 9-11 by Michael Rupert,
[02:13:41.707 --> 02:13:45.199]  We basically had an economy that was going to implode right before 9-11.
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:48.530]  He talks about how trillions of dollars goes of drug money.
[02:13:49.319 --> 02:13:50.901]  No, no, he was right about all of that.
[02:13:50.941 --> 02:13:56.166]  He was wrong about peak oil and pro-eugenics, you know, pro-population reduction.
[02:13:57.287 --> 02:13:59.529]  Yeah, and I disagree with him on peak oil, too.
[02:13:59.789 --> 02:14:01.251]  But he was right about a lot of the finances.
[02:14:01.291 --> 02:14:03.833]  Oh, well, they're certainly going to artificially take everything we got.
[02:14:03.853 --> 02:14:05.755]  That's kind of the left agenda.
[02:14:05.775 --> 02:14:12.001]  They tell the leftists, oh, everything's going to get real bad and our standard of living is going to go down, but we deserve it because of the peak oil.
[02:14:13.762 --> 02:14:16.765]  It's kind of a higher level disinfo plane.
[02:14:16.865 --> 02:14:19.108]  Each strata of society is giving their own disinfo.
[02:14:20.222 --> 02:14:22.542]  Yeah, yeah, and I want to confirm about Barry Jennings.
[02:14:22.562 --> 02:14:24.403]  Has that been confirmed that he has died?
[02:14:24.423 --> 02:14:25.583]  Okay, I'm going to explain it.
[02:14:25.723 --> 02:14:35.945]  And at the first hour I go into it, and the second hour it's about to re-air in 20 minutes at InfoWars.com, and then on the AM and FM's tonight, 9 to midnight, is when the network refeeds it over satellite for our affiliates.
[02:14:37.365 --> 02:14:43.726]  But yes, we confirm, we've talked to five people in the New York office that worked with him.
[02:14:43.766 --> 02:14:45.886]  He died August 19th.
[02:14:45.926 --> 02:14:46.366]  He's dead.
[02:14:48.947 --> 02:14:49.187]  Okay.
[02:14:50.609 --> 02:14:51.069]  Pardon me?
[02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:52.971]  Was it suicide?
[02:14:53.271 --> 02:14:56.254]  You'll have to tune in next hour, but they won't say.
[02:14:56.334 --> 02:14:57.395]  It's all very suspicious.
[02:14:58.716 --> 02:15:01.879]  I got you through the tip line the number for April Gallup.
[02:15:01.919 --> 02:15:03.920]  She wants to be on the show next week or after.
[02:15:03.961 --> 02:15:05.822]  I guess she's having medical work done this week.
[02:15:06.022 --> 02:15:06.583]  Okay, thank you.
[02:15:06.603 --> 02:15:07.123]  I gotta jump.
[02:15:07.143 --> 02:15:07.924]  Thanks for that number.
[02:15:08.264 --> 02:15:09.205]  We'll get April Gallup on.
[02:15:09.225 --> 02:15:09.906]  We've got that number.
[02:15:09.946 --> 02:15:10.326]  Thank you, sir.
[02:15:10.346 --> 02:15:11.367]  I gotta go fast here.
[02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:16.231]  Okay, let's go ahead to the other phone system.
[02:15:16.311 --> 02:15:17.132]  Mark in Oregon.
[02:15:17.152 --> 02:15:17.772]  You're on the air.
[02:15:17.792 --> 02:15:18.193]  Go ahead.
[02:15:19.090 --> 02:15:19.991]  Good day to you, Alex.
[02:15:20.071 --> 02:15:21.051]  Great to speak with you.
[02:15:22.332 --> 02:15:37.503]  Alex, at this point, with your dynamic personality, you're really bringing to the fore the extreme and urgent need to expose the evil in this world.
[02:15:38.003 --> 02:15:47.070]  I strongly feel and understand that we are, as we speak here today, at the giant and main fulcrum point
[02:15:48.095 --> 02:15:55.578]  Which is at the center of the struggle, spiritual and global, between good and evil in this world.
[02:15:55.658 --> 02:15:57.318]  It's going to go one way or the other.
[02:15:58.639 --> 02:16:01.440]  I've mentioned the phrase a short time frame to you before.
[02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:09.763]  I think I got it from you as a phrase applicable to the pace of the enemy on a global spiritual level over recent years.
[02:16:09.783 --> 02:16:11.063]  Well, they've got a window, yeah.
[02:16:11.583 --> 02:16:12.023]  They do.
[02:16:12.444 --> 02:16:12.744]  They do.
[02:16:17.290 --> 02:16:21.943]  The extreme vulnerability of the enemy is the greatest right now.
[02:16:23.694 --> 02:16:24.334]  That's right.
[02:16:24.354 --> 02:16:30.076]  People are now, for the first time ever, ready to hear, ready to know the truth, ready to wake up.
[02:16:31.917 --> 02:16:36.058]  I mean, there has never been more fertile fields to expose the tyranny.
[02:16:36.078 --> 02:16:40.580]  People are now ready to hear it, and we need to understand we are having a big effect.
[02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:41.740]  We have discredited them.
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:47.362]  Congress has a 9% approval rating, and anybody that tells you we... I mean, I see all these patriot people.
[02:16:47.822 --> 02:16:54.488]  And all they do on their websites and radio shows is say, we're losing, it's pathetic, we're bad, nobody's waking up, 9-11 Truth's bad.
[02:16:54.769 --> 02:16:55.729]  Those people are feds.
[02:16:56.410 --> 02:16:57.351]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:57.371 --> 02:17:06.860]  Because I notice it's all the same things they're saying, and it's kind of shocking to go, whoa, man, there's that many of them, or some of them are just being handled or copycats, kind of repeating.
[02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:08.581]  But it's bad.
[02:17:08.621 --> 02:17:12.345]  You're directly over the target, Alex, and you have been ever since you began.
[02:17:12.765 --> 02:17:24.139]  You have been hammering on them and hammering on them, and now when they have to go and expose themselves to any degree, that shows that you have actually gotten a chink going in their armor and the way you're pointing... Well, I have done nothing!
[02:17:24.239 --> 02:17:24.640]  You!
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:26.302]  All of us, through God!
[02:17:26.442 --> 02:17:27.343]  And that's real, folks!
[02:17:28.124 --> 02:17:28.544]  All of us.
[02:17:29.525 --> 02:17:32.666]  I mean, you've got to have a relationship with God to be able to deal with this, to know.
[02:17:32.746 --> 02:17:35.907]  I mean, you think I like knowing the government blew up the buildings?
[02:17:35.927 --> 02:17:36.847]  That's scary as hell.
[02:17:37.387 --> 02:17:40.709]  You think I like knowing they kidnap little kids when I have children?
[02:17:40.749 --> 02:17:41.909]  You think I like all this?
[02:17:41.969 --> 02:17:43.630]  And then I have to see our own movement?
[02:17:43.870 --> 02:17:50.192]  But I realize that's feds, that's COINTELPRO, and the good news is people aren't listening to them, so just thank God, praise God.
[02:17:50.592 --> 02:17:54.093]  And on the other side of it, Alex, their strength is the greatest right now.
[02:17:54.174 --> 02:17:57.895]  They have been building up to that point, too, and that comprises the fulcrum point.
[02:17:58.655 --> 02:18:12.221]  And whether it'll be their strength, or it will be the exposure of truth of what you have been the leader, as you say, and there have been multitudes, and are multitudes, and now it's increasing at an exponential rate, I believe, almost, because people are becoming desperate.
[02:18:12.261 --> 02:18:13.822]  They see the dangers in this world.
[02:18:13.862 --> 02:18:16.663]  And the enemy's telling us, our movement's nothing!
[02:18:17.443 --> 02:18:19.144]  Right when it's just... I mean...
[02:18:19.844 --> 02:18:22.186]  They're trying to belittle you in the eyes of the public.
[02:18:22.226 --> 02:18:28.112]  That's one of the tactics in order to stop this influence that you have in bringing people, exposing them.
[02:18:28.132 --> 02:18:30.194]  They want to discredit me so they can kill me.
[02:18:30.535 --> 02:18:31.916]  They have to discredit me first.
[02:18:31.996 --> 02:18:32.917]  That's the greatest danger.
[02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:39.283]  If they ever cook up some scandal or make some crap up about me, then they'll kill me soon after.
[02:18:39.564 --> 02:18:40.685]  God watches over you.
[02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:43.608]  I think they would have tried that if they thought they could.
[02:18:44.028 --> 02:18:48.252]  They may have tried it, not succeeded, and saw that there was really no way to do that.
[02:18:48.293 --> 02:18:55.780]  There are other factors that come into it, that God protects you by, that in their own mind it's just an inconvenience, it's a situational thing.
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:19:07.172]  The situation just happens to turn into a protection for you on an actual physical reality level, and they don't see that as the hand of God, but the hand of God is upon the Alex Jones, because
[02:19:07.692 --> 02:19:09.092]  You have been the leader, sir.
[02:19:09.412 --> 02:19:15.053]  If it wasn't for you, imagine where we would be today in this world, how much more progress they would have made.
[02:19:15.113 --> 02:19:18.394]  It would have been a little bit, but I believe they would have already implemented it.
[02:19:18.814 --> 02:19:29.756]  So you play a part, and the picture of reality is God sees it, He's put you here, and all I can say, sir, is God bless you.
[02:19:29.796 --> 02:19:32.417]  I have one other quick point, if I could mention it to you, Alex.
[02:19:32.457 --> 02:19:33.017]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:19:34.437 --> 02:19:42.250]  When it comes to the steep rise in gold today, I thought that the only way to actually counterbalance
[02:19:46.641 --> 02:19:54.746]  Demand on the market by just John Q Public is to dump gold on the market, and that's what we've been experiencing all along here.
[02:19:55.266 --> 02:20:09.294]  As far as we see the repression of the market, I believe this to be the main vehicle and tool and method that they use is just simply to dump the gold on the market, from what I've understood from yourself and other enlightened people that you've had on, such as Bob Chapman.
[02:20:10.143 --> 02:20:30.246]  And I believe that's what we're seeing today, and I believe they use this vehicle also outside to repress the market, to actually bring people into the market, and now people are transferring their assets, all of their assets, many of them, into the market of gold, and they're not repressing the market today, and I believe they're repressing it
[02:20:31.231 --> 02:20:36.475]  Not as much as they have been, and they're allowing the price to rise in order to bring people into the market.
[02:20:36.495 --> 02:20:36.835]  Oh, it's admitted.
[02:20:36.855 --> 02:20:38.616]  The whole stock market is completely fake.
[02:20:38.956 --> 02:20:40.477]  A lot of the transactions aren't even real.
[02:20:40.537 --> 02:20:42.659]  It's like Enron with fake computer computers.
[02:20:43.199 --> 02:20:44.420]  Fake energy trading computers.
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:46.702]  Listen, I appreciate your call, and thanks for the kind words.
[02:20:47.122 --> 02:20:48.883]  Hey, if you guys are game, I want to go into overdrive.
[02:20:51.184 --> 02:20:55.027]  Okay, you've got to go exclusively to the InfoWars.com streams, folks.
[02:20:55.167 --> 02:20:57.509]  Off the Genesis streams and other streams that are out there on the web.
[02:20:58.325 --> 02:21:01.628]  For AM and FM stations, we'll be gone in T-minus 15 minutes exactly.
[02:21:02.168 --> 02:21:04.730]  And I go into this overdrive because there's so much news I didn't get to.
[02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:06.512]  I'll just continue with calls till the end of the show.
[02:21:06.532 --> 02:21:09.394]  And then in overdrive, I'm going to get into some of this news.
[02:21:09.414 --> 02:21:13.438]  Or maybe I should get into the final news now, and then go into overdrive and take calls.
[02:21:13.538 --> 02:21:15.099]  It's just the news, it's so important.
[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:18.462]  Oh my God, but then the first of the show was so important.
[02:21:20.283 --> 02:21:21.765]  What I covered then, I don't know.
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:25.402]  Maybe I'll do five minutes of overdrive.
[02:21:25.742 --> 02:21:26.302]  How's that sound?
[02:21:26.843 --> 02:21:31.067]  And then everybody can go to the InfoWars streams, because what I covered in the first hour was too important to overdrive.
[02:21:31.687 --> 02:21:35.290]  The first five minutes I was kind of babbling, because I get overheated.
[02:21:35.310 --> 02:21:37.832]  I have so much information, and then I want to hear from the callers.
[02:21:38.673 --> 02:21:41.736]  Motto in Michigan, and JC, Chip, David, Ryan.
[02:21:41.756 --> 02:21:42.356]  Go ahead Motto.
[02:21:43.117 --> 02:21:43.598]  Hey Alex.
[02:21:44.198 --> 02:21:44.338]  Hey.
[02:21:46.489 --> 02:21:50.732]  The lady that called earlier sort of touched on what I was going to talk about, protecting your family.
[02:21:50.792 --> 02:21:59.137]  I talked to you either last week or the week before about posting on the MLive.com message board, which is for the Ann Arbor News.
[02:22:01.078 --> 02:22:06.961]  Some of the people that heard that, the Info Warriors out there, the 9-11 Truth people, came into that site.
[02:22:06.981 --> 02:22:08.462]  They're Michigan people as well.
[02:22:08.922 --> 02:22:10.944]  I want to say I appreciate what they did.
[02:22:11.024 --> 02:22:13.045]  Now today I've been posting the links on there.
[02:22:13.656 --> 02:22:14.076]  I don't know.
[02:22:33.123 --> 02:22:36.964]  Get on there, because that Operation Mockingbird thing is in full effect there.
[02:22:36.984 --> 02:22:38.845]  But don't think, folks, it doesn't have an effect.
[02:22:38.885 --> 02:22:40.445]  Just the action of resisting.
[02:22:41.025 --> 02:22:43.266]  Just the action of going and talking to others.
[02:22:43.746 --> 02:22:47.967]  Just the action of getting involved in little ways grows into bigger things.
[02:22:48.007 --> 02:22:48.888]  Gotta jump, motto.
[02:22:49.348 --> 02:22:51.088]  JC in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:22:51.948 --> 02:22:52.729]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:22:52.749 --> 02:22:54.569]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:22:56.050 --> 02:22:59.911]  I was really kind of excited that you had mentioned the future Damien Hirst.
[02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:04.452]  I covered that in the first hour, yeah.
[02:23:05.233 --> 02:23:24.287]  Yeah, I'm in the art world, and it's true that 1% of these, I don't even know what to call them, but they're the ones that buy these pieces that are just filthy and abominating, and they say, oh, how wonderful, how cool.
[02:23:25.388 --> 02:23:30.972]  And really, the people that are on the fringe of that, that see and hear that, you know,
[02:23:32.262 --> 02:23:51.117]  If you're lucky and you're able to tell them what those people are and who they are and what they're about, these collectors, you're able to get through to somebody and maybe be some sort of an influence, which is good.
[02:23:51.197 --> 02:23:56.322]  But so many times, people that are generally older, because of Damien Hirst, he's a Londoner,
[02:23:58.516 --> 02:24:02.638]  You know, real big, hips looking cool with a lot of these people in the art world.
[02:24:02.698 --> 02:24:11.563]  Yeah, well, the point is, the elites make death art, dead baby maggot art, it's what I call the genre, dead baby art, is their favorite for decades.
[02:24:11.903 --> 02:24:21.828]  As a God-loving Christian, it horrifies me, and I know that sometimes that, you know, seeing these things that, you know, that I, you know, am I in the right place?
[02:24:22.148 --> 02:24:24.449]  God, am I, you know, am I supposed to be here?
[02:24:25.470 --> 02:24:27.711]  But, you know, just like you, Alex, you know, you
[02:24:28.810 --> 02:24:29.090]  If you're
[02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:52.071]  That's really the answer, is you turn loose.
[02:24:52.631 --> 02:24:55.292]  You turn loose of even loving your life.
[02:24:55.712 --> 02:25:00.754]  Because you love life so much, you realize you've got to put your life in danger to save others.
[02:25:01.154 --> 02:25:05.375]  It sounds sappy, but when you have an attitude to save others, then you get saved.
[02:25:06.676 --> 02:25:11.978]  And if you're lucky, you get to be saved over and over again, and be active.
[02:25:14.082 --> 02:25:18.404]  Well, you don't grow until you realize you're part of the larger species.
[02:25:18.865 --> 02:25:23.987]  And until you realize your willingness to sacrifice is the attitude that will save you and everybody else.
[02:25:24.307 --> 02:25:25.247]  I appreciate your call.
[02:25:25.267 --> 02:25:26.568]  I've got to jump, JC.
[02:25:26.928 --> 02:25:27.688]  Chip in Michigan.
[02:25:27.728 --> 02:25:28.449]  Go ahead, Chip.
[02:25:29.289 --> 02:25:29.949]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:34.091]  Hey, I'm a little confused about the gold and silver possession thing.
[02:25:35.492 --> 02:25:35.952]  I'm curious.
[02:25:36.012 --> 02:25:39.034]  If the economy tanks completely, right?
[02:25:39.074 --> 02:25:39.874]  Banks closed.
[02:25:40.347 --> 02:25:43.729]  If you have physical dollars, they wouldn't be worth anything anyway.
[02:25:44.369 --> 02:25:46.811]  Now this is going to cause complete chaos, literally.
[02:25:47.491 --> 02:25:50.573]  Okay, people are just going to, the criminals are going to think it's a free-for-all.
[02:25:51.213 --> 02:25:56.776]  And now I live five miles from downtown Detroit, which is rife with criminals, especially the mayor.
[02:25:57.416 --> 02:26:06.001]  Now I'm thinking, how is having physical gold and silver in my possession going to benefit me at that point?
[02:26:06.041 --> 02:26:07.442]  Well, you're not listening, you're not listening.
[02:26:09.099 --> 02:26:12.182]  It's better than having the bank just close and say you don't get your money.
[02:26:12.262 --> 02:26:22.090]  At least you have something that's small and portable and where you can store a great amount of wealth in a small area and at some later date find someone who wants that or barter it or sell it.
[02:26:22.410 --> 02:26:23.951]  So see, there's no perfect equation.
[02:26:23.971 --> 02:26:25.212]  There's no way to save yourself.
[02:26:25.412 --> 02:26:26.653]  People always want solutions.
[02:26:27.754 --> 02:26:29.376]  There is no perfect silver bullet.
[02:26:29.436 --> 02:26:35.761]  The best thing is friends and family that love you and knowing how to be self-sufficient and having some property.
[02:26:36.738 --> 02:26:44.222]  But then, down the road when the dollars devalue and they have a new currency, you'll be able to cash gold in to get that new currency to pay your taxes with.
[02:26:44.242 --> 02:26:44.722]  You understand?
[02:26:45.322 --> 02:26:45.803]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:26:45.823 --> 02:26:47.364]  That's always going to be worth something.
[02:26:47.384 --> 02:26:55.888]  But my concern is that, I guess because of my location, so close to a big city, is that, you know, do I invest in this gold and silver now?
[02:26:55.988 --> 02:26:56.428]  Stay there.
[02:26:56.468 --> 02:26:57.629]  I'll talk to you behind the scenes.
[02:26:57.869 --> 02:26:59.450]  Got to go to InfoWars.com, folks.
[02:27:02.176 --> 02:27:06.580]  Okay, listen, everybody looks for a perfect solution from me.
[02:27:07.161 --> 02:27:09.984]  And see, I'm not like a politician that'll tell you I have a perfect solution.
[02:27:10.364 --> 02:27:18.071]  I'll give you my information and what I see happening historically and the info I have, and a lot of it's going, oh look, YouTube says no more free speech.
[02:27:18.452 --> 02:27:21.495]  I mean, it's simply just reporting the facts.
[02:27:21.555 --> 02:27:22.155]  It's not hard.
[02:27:22.896 --> 02:27:23.156]  Right.
[02:27:23.276 --> 02:27:25.697]  The IMF and World Bank said they do this to our economy.
[02:27:25.737 --> 02:27:26.177]  They are.
[02:27:26.797 --> 02:27:28.098]  This is a planned occurrence.
[02:27:29.478 --> 02:27:31.019]  So people then say, well, what do we do?
[02:27:31.919 --> 02:27:33.239]  I mean, do you have a better plan?
[02:27:33.259 --> 02:27:36.940]  Have you happened to have some wealth of storing it in a portable, private way?
[02:27:38.941 --> 02:27:39.201]  No.
[02:27:39.381 --> 02:27:43.022]  Actually, when I was asking you, I wasn't really asking you for a solution.
[02:27:43.082 --> 02:27:44.903]  I was just sort of throwing it out there, you know.
[02:27:44.923 --> 02:27:46.243]  I mean, it is the best solution.
[02:27:46.704 --> 02:27:47.724]  It's just not foolproof.
[02:27:47.764 --> 02:27:48.624]  There's nothing foolproof.
[02:27:48.644 --> 02:27:48.784]  Right.
[02:27:49.865 --> 02:27:50.105]  Right.
[02:27:50.165 --> 02:27:50.645]  That's true.
[02:27:50.765 --> 02:27:51.225]  That's true.
[02:27:54.096 --> 02:27:55.698]  Only thing full proof is that you're going to die.
[02:27:55.718 --> 02:27:56.980]  It's full proof.
[02:27:58.522 --> 02:27:59.283]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:27:59.323 --> 02:27:59.823]  That's true.
[02:27:59.863 --> 02:28:07.072]  I'm just thinking, you know, gold and silver is not going to protect my family because, I mean, if the chaos happens, I'm thinking I'd rather invest in a pistol.
[02:28:07.092 --> 02:28:08.234]  I don't have a whole lot of money.
[02:28:08.254 --> 02:28:09.535]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:28:09.595 --> 02:28:10.517]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:28:10.537 --> 02:28:12.799]  Gold and silver are for people that have some wealth.
[02:28:13.593 --> 02:28:14.855]  And the average American doesn't.
[02:28:14.875 --> 02:28:15.415]  I gotta jump.
[02:28:15.435 --> 02:28:16.076]  Thanks for the call.
[02:28:16.737 --> 02:28:17.418]  Absolutely.
[02:28:17.478 --> 02:28:25.807]  No, if you don't have a lot of money, a little bit of storable food, a handgun, ammo, and the willingness to use it to protect your family.
[02:28:26.570 --> 02:28:28.091]  And having a talk with your family now.
[02:28:28.791 --> 02:28:34.053]  See, children start behaving, and wives start listening, and husbands start listening when stuff gets serious.
[02:28:34.073 --> 02:28:35.374]  They find out what family is all about.
[02:28:35.794 --> 02:28:53.521]  And all this, if you watch TV, the soul-sucking shows with yachts and champagne, and everybody feeling envious to make you feel inadequate, and to make you feel pathetic, and to make you hate your husband and wife, and to make you not appreciate what you've got, these wonderful children, wonderful out to the sky, the wonderful food, all the good stuff we've had.
[02:28:54.221 --> 02:28:56.882]  You see, they make you not appreciate that, and they take it all away from you.
[02:28:58.703 --> 02:29:01.505]  They give you these false idols of what you've got to have.
[02:29:01.805 --> 02:29:03.606]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Virginia.
[02:29:03.646 --> 02:29:04.306]  Go ahead, David.
[02:29:05.467 --> 02:29:07.348]  Alex, I really appreciate you taking my call.
[02:29:07.368 --> 02:29:09.589]  I've enjoyed your show for a long time, never called before.
[02:29:10.129 --> 02:29:17.033]  I'm a 32-year-old man who decided... I got married this summer, and I left my job and decided to go back to college and finish my degree.
[02:29:17.833 --> 02:29:21.075]  And I decided to go back and get a degree in sustainable development.
[02:29:22.026 --> 02:29:28.589]  And very quickly in my studies, I realized that there's really sort of two schools of thought within sustainability.
[02:29:30.469 --> 02:29:36.132]  They have the outside sustainability people that mean to do well, but that never is implemented, and then they have the eugenicist.
[02:29:37.252 --> 02:29:37.832]  Absolutely.
[02:29:37.932 --> 02:29:49.477]  As a matter of fact, I'm doing research on a paper right now that I'm writing for a class, and I'm making the argument that sustainability cannot happen without democratic ideology, without
[02:29:50.413 --> 02:29:53.937]  Private property protection and civil liberties and people feeling safe.
[02:29:53.957 --> 02:29:57.081]  Because that actually brings true sustainability and true stewardship.
[02:29:57.461 --> 02:30:03.208]  By sustainability, they just mean taxing your breathing and then cross-species genetically engineering and dumping toxic waste.
[02:30:03.528 --> 02:30:07.793]  All the real environmental degradation intensifies, but then humans are made evil.
[02:30:08.054 --> 02:30:09.796]  That's according to the CFR, Richard N. Haas.
[02:30:10.623 --> 02:30:13.166]  You know, I sometimes... Hold on, we're gonna go back live right now.
[02:30:13.187 --> 02:30:15.269]  We're gonna go back live.
[02:30:15.289 --> 02:30:16.391]  Here we go.
[02:30:16.851 --> 02:30:25.663]  And the flames went higher, and it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[02:30:28.245 --> 02:30:30.806]  Oh, the taste of love is sweet when hearts like ours meet.
[02:30:30.826 --> 02:30:48.693]  I'm only going to do eight minutes overdrive on the InfoWars.com streams because what I covered after that was just too important about what looks like a murder of Barry Jennings, 9-11, a whistleblower about bombs in the buildings, deputy head of emergency management there in New York over his department, the economy, the guests, all the information.
[02:30:51.052 --> 02:30:54.837]  But I also want to get into YouTube's version of Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act.
[02:30:56.779 --> 02:30:59.162]  This is so big here, I should have started the show with this actually.
[02:30:59.182 --> 02:31:00.183]  This is just so massive.
[02:31:00.724 --> 02:31:03.407]  It's up on Infowars.com and it's actually happening.
[02:31:03.707 --> 02:31:04.628]  I can't even believe this.
[02:31:06.951 --> 02:31:08.173]  Did the phone system just dump out?
[02:31:09.751 --> 02:31:11.234]  Okay, David in Virginia, finish up.
[02:31:11.274 --> 02:31:21.649]  You were saying, you're taking, you've got a degree in sustainable development, and you're saying... I have a degree in sustainable development, and I'm taking the slant that sustainability can't happen without democracy.
[02:31:22.059 --> 02:31:25.742]  The point is, oil is toxic in its refining with the chemicals and byproducts.
[02:31:47.843 --> 02:32:07.460]  Absolutely, and one of the things that I wanted to touch on is, as I started digging into some of these organizations that are, as a matter of fact, there's a website called sustainability.com, and if you wanted a lesson on the New World Order, go to this website and just see who supports these people.
[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:11.464]  And this was, in just some cursory examination I was doing, I find three organizations
[02:32:11.904 --> 02:32:15.307]  All of which have the exact same people on their boards of trustees.
[02:32:15.787 --> 02:32:17.028]  One of these organizations... Hey, you know what?
[02:32:17.068 --> 02:32:17.709]  Let's do this.
[02:32:17.829 --> 02:32:19.510]  Fax me some proof of your degree on that.
[02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:20.091]  I believe you.
[02:32:20.291 --> 02:32:22.152]  You ought to be a 30-minute guest with us someday.
[02:32:22.192 --> 02:32:24.654]  Get his number right now, Bob.
[02:32:25.595 --> 02:32:29.098]  I want to get... David, you want to be a guest on the show?
[02:32:29.838 --> 02:32:30.698]  I'd love to talk to you, Alex.
[02:32:30.738 --> 02:32:30.899]  Sure.
[02:32:30.959 --> 02:32:33.760]  Okay, we'll just get it and give it to Trey and send it out the next week.
[02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:34.920]  Thanks.
[02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:41.023]  I've got to end this now, and I've got some Genesis calls, but how long did it take, about 10 or 15 calls?
[02:32:41.043 --> 02:32:41.684]  How long did that take?
[02:32:42.324 --> 02:32:44.645]  Probably about 12 calls or so in the last 45 minutes.
[02:32:45.165 --> 02:32:46.046]  That's pretty good for me.
[02:32:46.246 --> 02:32:55.310]  I've got a few things I've got to plug here, right at the end of the show, and then there's eight minutes of overdrive where I'm going to cover the biggest news story of the day that I never got to.
[02:32:55.330 --> 02:32:58.932]  I would do more overdrive, but
[02:33:02.148 --> 02:33:05.491]  That's really a shadow of the show, you know, maybe 10,000 internet listeners.
[02:33:06.291 --> 02:33:07.532]  Get the free podcast, folks.
[02:33:07.572 --> 02:33:16.499]  Also, the internet was down earlier in the show, so that's why that first hour is so important to re-air there, because I know a lot of people get those and magnify them and put them up on YouTube, and the rest of it.
[02:33:18.921 --> 02:33:26.067]  But, I want to tell you about eFoods Direct, the best storable foods company out there, the longest continually operating one in the country.
[02:33:26.107 --> 02:33:29.210]  They've got a free brochure, free audio CD,
[02:33:31.496 --> 02:33:35.199]  We're Steve Shank, the owner for 27 years, breaks it all down, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:33:45.788 --> 02:33:48.109]  Again, 800-409-5633.
[02:33:48.229 --> 02:33:50.309]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own food.
[02:33:50.729 --> 02:33:54.571]  And inflation's 15% a year compounded, folks, and food's even higher.
[02:33:55.151 --> 02:33:56.671]  And if you don't get storable food, you're crazy.
[02:33:56.691 --> 02:34:01.433]  800-409-5633, eFoodsDirect.com, banners at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:01.873 --> 02:34:04.694]  And then just an incredible new sponsor we've had for a few months.
[02:34:04.734 --> 02:34:06.634]  We've got a couple of them here in the office.
[02:34:06.674 --> 02:34:07.854]  They get 7.5 gallons a day.
[02:34:10.395 --> 02:34:11.376]  Half of that in a desert.
[02:34:11.817 --> 02:34:13.478]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[02:34:13.518 --> 02:34:15.961]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[02:34:16.281 --> 02:34:17.842]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[02:34:17.862 --> 02:34:18.543]  Here's their number.
[02:34:18.903 --> 02:34:20.485]  acolablue.com is the website.
[02:34:20.505 --> 02:34:21.105]  1-866-585-4044.
[02:34:21.125 --> 02:34:22.106]  Call them, get a free brochure.
[02:34:22.727 --> 02:34:23.027]  It's amazing.
[02:34:23.047 --> 02:34:23.087]  866-585-4044.
[02:34:28.812 --> 02:34:29.292]  A day off.
[02:34:53.988 --> 02:34:56.509]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[02:34:57.510 --> 02:35:00.431]  We are in overdrive right now, correct, Houston?
[02:35:01.232 --> 02:35:01.932]  I am good.
[02:35:03.453 --> 02:35:08.516]  Okay, let me... There's some news I wanted to hit here at the end.
[02:35:08.536 --> 02:35:15.219]  This has been a... We've been live for three hours now on the PrisonPlanet.tv streams, so that'll be up there also.
[02:35:15.239 --> 02:35:20.482]  We're still streaming live, but in a few hours we'll be up at PrisonPlanet.tv for folks, and I want to thank all of you at YouTube and
[02:35:22.028 --> 02:35:34.152]  Daily Motion, all the other great sites, and now because YouTube and Google are censoring openly in policy, don't desert them, because that's still a big viral spread area to get into the enemy matrix and deprogram.
[02:35:35.073 --> 02:35:41.215]  But doubles, you know, put it up on Blip.TV or Daily Motion or Lively.
[02:35:42.836 --> 02:35:44.416]  Doppelganger attack pattern.
[02:35:44.436 --> 02:35:49.538]  When the enemy tries to move with censorship, you intensify the attack on their operation.
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:54.860]  I mean, we are really hurting them bad right now.
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:36:00.181]  Now, this story... This story needs to be turned into a YouTube clip, so I'm requesting this right now.
[02:36:01.081 --> 02:36:02.002]  Huge development!
[02:36:02.062 --> 02:36:06.902]  We know with Internet, too, they want to tax and regulate and shut down the old hubs and force you onto the new ones.
[02:36:06.942 --> 02:36:16.844]  We know in France and Germany and Europe, they're banning a lot of free speech on the Internet and setting up Internet commissions and making people register websites and they use firewalls at Google and Yahoo!
[02:36:16.884 --> 02:36:20.505]  Run and China and other areas to restrict free speech and censor the web.
[02:36:21.874 --> 02:36:35.142]  So our NSA founded, DARPA founded internet grid run by Google and Yahoo and others that control the infrastructure, not even the infrastructure, the software, they're killing the web.
[02:36:35.162 --> 02:36:37.484]  But a few months ago this man, Lieberman,
[02:36:38.797 --> 02:36:53.184]  Who openly calls for fascism in the United States, and is basically a foreign agent, not really an American, says that he wanted YouTube and Google, anything that criticized the government, anything that criticized the military, anything that made the military look bad, is helping terrorists.
[02:36:53.505 --> 02:36:56.526]  Troops massacring children, killing animals.
[02:36:57.627 --> 02:37:03.510]  And I noticed that even after YouTube
[02:37:06.661 --> 02:37:14.464]  Had pulled the videos over and over again, the Marines throwing the puppy off, which was later admitted by the Marines to be real, ABC, Fox were playing it and saying it's horrible.
[02:37:15.605 --> 02:37:18.146]  But YouTube wouldn't allow you to upload that and they would erase it.
[02:37:18.566 --> 02:37:22.748]  And videos of troops for fun, shooting families off the road, they take those down.
[02:37:23.707 --> 02:37:29.635]  And now they tell you in the rules area of YouTube that that is terrorism.
[02:37:30.416 --> 02:37:32.740]  Now they also mention H.R.
[02:37:33.701 --> 02:37:36.745]  1955 entitled, Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention.
[02:37:37.614 --> 02:37:49.903]  And in that, it's passed the House, and they had hearings last year and earlier this year where they showed on C-SPAN during the hearings architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, which have gotten peer-reviewed that the buildings were blown up, basically.
[02:37:50.304 --> 02:37:52.686]  You bet that threatens the people that blew them up, the real terrorists.
[02:37:53.386 --> 02:37:58.030]  And they show them with Al-Qaeda videos, training videos, and say, this is Al-Qaeda, it needs to be banned.
[02:37:58.910 --> 02:38:00.832]  So, I mean, it's so over the top.
[02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:03.611]  Yeah, 9-11 Truth's dead.
[02:38:03.631 --> 02:38:04.592]  The government keeps saying that.
[02:38:04.632 --> 02:38:05.452]  It's bigger than ever.
[02:38:05.492 --> 02:38:06.854]  They're scared to death of it, folks.
[02:38:07.194 --> 02:38:09.115]  Their operatives are out there telling us to stand down.
[02:38:09.636 --> 02:38:12.318]  YouTube's version of Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act.
[02:38:13.439 --> 02:38:16.000]  YouTube has implemented its very own version of H.R.
[02:38:16.021 --> 02:38:27.749]  1955, entitled the Violent Radicalization Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act, or 1955, which is in the Senate and is not law as of this writing.
[02:38:28.592 --> 02:38:29.752]  It's passed the House and the Senate.
[02:38:30.192 --> 02:38:34.014]  But for the millions of people who post on YouTube, however, it may as well be law.
[02:38:35.954 --> 02:38:49.658]  You may recall Senator Joseph Lieberman earlier this year barking orders from on high down at Google, the owner of YouTube, demanding the popular video site block content depicting assassinations, death of U.S.
[02:38:49.718 --> 02:38:56.220]  soldiers, as well as weapons training and speeches that encourage violence and could be used as a tool to create homegrown terrorists.
[02:38:56.980 --> 02:39:01.544]  You show a mainline AP clip of a tank getting blown up, they'll suspend your account.
[02:39:02.164 --> 02:39:04.966]  Or you're a Marine and come back and show your own video, they ban it.
[02:39:05.427 --> 02:39:06.387]  So it's horrible.
[02:39:06.968 --> 02:39:15.515]  As Dee Chismero writes for Eflux Media, at the time YouTube called foul and said we respect and understand Lieberman's views.
[02:39:15.535 --> 02:39:19.778]  YouTube encourages free speech and defends everybody's right to expect unpopular points of view.
[02:39:20.238 --> 02:39:23.301]  So it's okay to show simulated murder of soldiers all day and
[02:39:23.621 --> 02:39:28.343]  Women and children in these games, or the rape of prostitutes, are ultimately fighting for that matter.
[02:39:29.064 --> 02:39:30.645]  And I'm not calling to restrict them, by the way.
[02:39:30.665 --> 02:39:40.410]  My point is, now they want to restrict our right, because we're destroying the mainstream media, the newspapers are falling apart, mainstream media is imploding, because they've been caught lying so much.
[02:39:41.593 --> 02:39:47.581]  Now, Lieberman now has released a press release saying he appreciates YouTube, he wants Google to do more to ban free speech.
[02:39:48.322 --> 02:39:53.930]  Four short months later, after media attention has long since shifted elsewhere, YouTube and Google have sent the
[02:39:54.721 --> 02:39:56.382]  The First Amendment to the Recycle Bin.
[02:39:57.063 --> 02:40:02.006]  YouTube has posted a warning in its community guidelines meant to stop such videos from being uploaded on YouTube.
[02:40:02.326 --> 02:40:05.048]  A move that apparently pleased the neocon Lieberman at least somewhat.
[02:40:05.608 --> 02:40:14.995]  Senator Lieberman hailed YouTube's decision to strengthen its standards, however, he also continued to urge Google, who owns YouTube, to remove all videos produced by foreign terrorist organizations.
[02:40:15.335 --> 02:40:18.657]  You mean those uploaded by the CIA and they've been caught doing it?
[02:40:18.757 --> 02:40:19.158]  Fake ones?
[02:40:20.538 --> 02:40:21.159]  Yeah, go check it out.
[02:40:21.179 --> 02:40:21.999]  They've been caught on record.
[02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:25.542]  Not just those that violate community guidelines, explains.
[02:40:26.003 --> 02:40:34.010]  So, if you read the bill for yourself, it says anything basically criticizing the government, H.R.
[02:40:34.030 --> 02:40:34.010]  1955.
[02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:39.554]  And they mention architects and engineers for 9-11 truth.
[02:40:39.995 --> 02:40:42.677]  Now 400 and something architects, engineers, and physicists.
[02:40:42.717 --> 02:40:45.319]  I mean, that scares them in peer-reviewed journals now.
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:48.162]  I mean, big journals are peer-reviewing it and saying, yeah, Bob's
[02:40:51.716 --> 02:40:56.803]  It goes on, even so Lieberman insisted YouTube represents a tool for Islamist terror organizations to recruit and train followers.
[02:40:56.843 --> 02:40:59.646]  That said, it's time to pull out all this info and perspective.
[02:41:00.047 --> 02:41:06.194]  First and foremost, the validity of Al-Qaeda and other supposed terrorist videos that inevitably end up on YouTube must be challenged.
[02:41:07.049 --> 02:41:17.479]  And major studies have been done at the Intel Center run by former Black Ops commanders from Psychological Warfare under Rumsfeld in the Pentagon and CIA run Intel Center.
[02:41:17.719 --> 02:41:22.643]  They upload their Intel Center logos in the same video layer as the Al Qaeda scroll.
[02:41:22.743 --> 02:41:24.044]  I mean, come on folks.
[02:41:24.465 --> 02:41:31.811]  White guys, ADL, heads, sons and grandsons are white Al Qaeda saying, I'm going to kill you.
[02:41:32.532 --> 02:41:37.597]  They use computer-generated bin ladens that have been exposed to be fakes, that are video game quality.
[02:41:37.697 --> 02:41:39.198]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:41:41.420 --> 02:41:42.161]  And it goes on.
[02:41:43.322 --> 02:41:50.629]  In other words, Lieberman and Google should have banned the CIA and the Sovereign from posting fake videos, and a number of videos are so obviously fake
[02:41:51.713 --> 02:41:53.473]  As to be ridiculous.
[02:41:53.973 --> 02:41:54.974]  And the article goes on.
[02:41:55.694 --> 02:41:58.334]  Understand, folks, America is America.
[02:41:58.534 --> 02:41:59.935]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:42:00.375 --> 02:42:03.095]  Because we do have a First Amendment.
[02:42:03.835 --> 02:42:04.956]  And they are attacking it.
[02:42:05.016 --> 02:42:05.996]  They are going after it.
[02:42:07.536 --> 02:42:13.457]  And they say the terrorists attacked us to get our liberties and our freedoms.
[02:42:14.237 --> 02:42:17.438]  But then the government's always taking our liberties and our freedoms.
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:21.423]  YouTube needs to be, sponsors need to be boycotted.
[02:42:23.085 --> 02:42:24.546]  But do not stop posting there.
[02:42:24.586 --> 02:42:30.692]  Post under other names, post under duplicates, slightly change videos, and realize the Internet's under attack.
[02:42:31.798 --> 02:42:45.001]  And use it while we still have it, because under Internet 2 and separate videos and articles we've written about that at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we break down the statements by Internet executives, by Time Warner, by Comcast.
[02:42:45.341 --> 02:42:48.621]  They're already doing it in Texas and areas of Canada and Europe.
[02:42:49.942 --> 02:42:53.162]  It's a cocktail or multiple attacks, a squeeze job happening.
[02:42:53.682 --> 02:42:55.703]  So use the Internet while it's still there
[02:42:56.483 --> 02:43:14.551]  in its current free form to some extent and fight for its continued freedom but act like and behave like it won't be there tomorrow this is so important ladies and gentlemen this is really happening call your congressman call your senators because that's it's already passed the house and tell them do not pass H.R.
[02:43:14.571 --> 02:43:19.513]  1955 that creates a federal board that will decide
[02:43:21.291 --> 02:43:25.634]  Who gets to basically have free speech?
[02:43:25.654 --> 02:43:28.716]  And they say they want to certify websites, whether they're trusted or not.
[02:43:29.016 --> 02:43:31.878]  I mean, this is a government censorship board.
[02:43:32.818 --> 02:43:37.961]  The White House admits they've paid for tens of billions of fake newscasts a year, fake reporters.
[02:43:38.061 --> 02:43:40.063]  Armstrong Williams is on the tip of the iceberg.
[02:43:41.257 --> 02:43:45.002]  They admit for three years, CENTCOM engages in fighting with bloggers online.
[02:43:45.022 --> 02:43:48.066]  A lot of the handles on YouTube and Google attacking us and threatening us.
[02:43:48.347 --> 02:43:50.089]  You go back to their MySpace and Facebook.
[02:43:50.350 --> 02:43:51.251]  It is military.
[02:43:51.691 --> 02:43:52.673]  Psyops people.
[02:43:52.993 --> 02:43:55.236]  These are un-American trash who hate this country.
[02:43:55.397 --> 02:43:56.758]  They want to bring down the First Amendment.
[02:43:57.199 --> 02:44:01.341]  The American people together, all of you taking action, can defeat them and will defeat them.
[02:44:01.361 --> 02:44:06.163]  So defend the First Amendment and call Congress and tell them no to H.R.
[02:44:06.183 --> 02:44:09.804]  1955, the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act.
[02:44:10.204 --> 02:44:11.105]  God bless you all.
[02:44:11.145 --> 02:44:23.110]  We now go back to re-transmission from the first hour where I break down the sick taste of the elite, the clear murder of Barry Jennings, and much, much more, the imploding economy by design.
[02:44:23.550 --> 02:44:24.453]  Stay with us.
[02:44:24.613 --> 02:44:26.358]  Transmission live now ends.
[02:44:26.418 --> 02:44:27.481]  Back tomorrow, live 11 a.m.
