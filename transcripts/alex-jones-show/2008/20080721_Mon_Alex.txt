[00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:23.218]  We have the maker of the preeminent film on the ruling class, who through sleight of hand, fractional reserve banking, owned much of the planet.
[00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:31.770]  And now I want what little bits of wealth are left from the American people who are their ancestral enemies.
[00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.494]  Pat Carmack is our guest, the maker of the film, and Bill Still, the narrator.
[00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:39.077]  It's available at Infowars.com.
[00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:47.725]  Recapping for some stations that I know have just joined us or listeners, Pat Carmack, of course, has been a banker, been involved in business, been involved in oil.
[00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.787]  We're good to go.
[00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:04.448]  I started his journey.
[00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:07.012]  So many of us started out on our journeys that way.
[00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:09.555]  Somebody challenged us with some information.
[00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:10.436]  We think it's bull.
[00:01:10.997 --> 00:01:13.601]  We look into it and we find out that it's not bull.
[00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:14.522]  It's the real world.
[00:01:15.263 --> 00:01:19.929]  I know we've got some callers that are off topic and I'm going to get to you regardless, but I know John, George, Kyle and others.
[00:01:22.136 --> 00:01:23.777]  Mike and others are for the guests.
[00:01:23.797 --> 00:01:35.801]  So let's get some of those calls out of the way, and then we're going to get into whatever issues our guests want to discuss on Monetary System, what we're facing, how it works, and their solution, which I think is the best I've seen out there bar none.
[00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:40.102]  And you know I don't just toot people's horns unless I really believe it.
[00:01:40.902 --> 00:01:44.864]  And it looked good to me 12 years ago, 13 years ago when I first saw it.
[00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:51.166]  Now that I know so much more and have interviewed so many experts, it seems like the only way out.
[00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:58.168]  Now because the bankers are going to bankrupt us and then always offer another solution that gets you deeper into their control.
[00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:00.228]  That's why we have to identify them.
[00:02:00.448 --> 00:02:01.569]  That's why we have to fight them.
[00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:02.629]  You can't just ignore this.
[00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.290]  This affects you whether you mow lawns for a living or you're a rocket scientist.
[00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.951]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio.
[00:02:10.251 --> 00:02:12.872]  You're on the guest with the folks from the Money Masters.
[00:02:14.152 --> 00:02:19.814]  Yes, this comment is related but it also branches off into your previous guest.
[00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:29.218]  I think it would be interesting to have Webster Tarpley on, because I think he offers a genuinely populist, genuine leftist point of view.
[00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:30.118]  He's on next week.
[00:02:30.418 --> 00:02:36.983]  Well, that's great, because I think he has more than just calls for austerity, cutbacks on
[00:02:38.582 --> 00:02:49.365]  The social spending, which, you know, the safety net programs, and this kind of... Well, the bankers only offered that to get us under their control and domesticate us.
[00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:52.466]  Now they're taking it away from the hogs because it's time for slaughter.
[00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:59.348]  Right, but I'm saying under these conditions, austerity and cutback would be the hard landing that we all want to avoid.
[00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:06.490]  And I also wanted to point out that I believe that as we head into this mad war that these neocons want to
[00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:23.698]  Bring us into, I think people like Jerome Corsi are really two-faced ponies because I've heard him recently and over the years constantly pushing all of the kind of ultra neocon scaremongering about terrorism that got us into the war in Iraq and just about a month ago on coast to coast.
[00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:33.500]  He jointly with the host was talking about Iran possibly giving terrorist nuclear bombs to plant here
[00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:45.657]  And he's organizing some of these people that he calls freedom fighters that you obviously show are nothing but CIA-run terrorists, Al-Qaeda-type terrorists.
[00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:48.421]  This man is connected, I'm absolutely certain.
[00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:58.880]  Well, I mean, we bring on serious guests and we just want to get his info on Obama.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800]  We're obviously going to be exposing McCain.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.901]  It really makes no difference and I appreciate your call, John.
[00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:10.123]  What about what he just brought up, Pat and Bill, the first part of his comment about
[00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:13.964]  I mean, I guess that brings us to your solutions.
[00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:19.147]  What the bankers are offering, where does that lead us versus what you're saying?
[00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:21.369]  Well, actually, they don't offer a solution.
[00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:22.389]  It's just more of the same.
[00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.332]  What we've got right now is, you know, our deficit's running over 400 billion a year.
[00:04:27.352 --> 00:04:31.255]  That's roughly the amount we pay on interest to the national debt.
[00:04:32.135 --> 00:04:34.757]  And so this gentleman was talking about a soft landing.
[00:04:35.504 --> 00:04:39.307]  And so on, versus austerity and everybody cutting back and so forth.
[00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:47.832]  Well, the problem is we're paying $400 billion a year to the bankers, and what we have to do is to reform the system so we no longer do that.
[00:04:47.852 --> 00:04:59.400]  Put very simply, we simply need to repeal the Federal Reserve Act, and rather than borrowing the money the government needs to spend, the government needs to create it itself.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.643]  The principal objection to that is it would cause hyperinflation.
[00:05:04.147 --> 00:05:05.127]  That's certainly true.
[00:05:05.207 --> 00:05:17.212]  So another law has to pass at the same time that raises the reserve requirements in banks from 10% to 100% at the same time period that we're paying off the national debt.
[00:05:17.412 --> 00:05:20.273]  And by the way, people love to say, you mean our government issues the money?
[00:05:20.693 --> 00:05:22.313]  That's how it's supposed to work.
[00:05:22.813 --> 00:05:32.937]  Instead of having private banks essentially be the government, now with their new fake carbon tax credit, the central banks want us to buy our carbon credits from them, literally taxing breathing.
[00:05:33.703 --> 00:05:33.923]  Right.
[00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:46.267]  Well, if I could quote Lincoln on that, quote, the government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers.
[00:05:46.687 --> 00:05:57.490]  The privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government, but it is the government's greatest creative opportunity, close quote, Abraham Lincoln.
[00:05:58.632 --> 00:06:06.554]  Yeah, but they've taken that engine of creativity and empowering people and turned it into an agent of feudalism and criminal consolidation of wealth.
[00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:07.694]  Go ahead, Pat.
[00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:10.234]  Well, precisely, because rather than the U.S.
[00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:19.836]  government having that power, which is appropriate to the sovereign power, they've, by the Federal Reserve Act, they've got Congress to delegate it to private banks.
[00:06:19.936 --> 00:06:22.957]  It's the very banks we were talking about, the ones that own the Federal Reserve.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.740]  So those banks make our money.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.500]  They create it.
[00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:30.001]  And so wealth's being transferred to them at an extremely rapid rate.
[00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:40.023]  And to solve this economic problem we have, we simply have to repeal the Federal Reserve Act, or so reform it, that that power is restored to the government.
[00:06:40.783 --> 00:06:42.923]  And that can be done.
[00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:47.244]  It does not result in any economic hardship.
[00:06:47.304 --> 00:06:51.845]  In fact, to the contrary, rather than having a recession or a depression,
[00:06:54.606 --> 00:07:04.532]  Absolutely.
[00:07:04.572 --> 00:07:06.313]  Anything else on that subject, Bill?
[00:07:07.934 --> 00:07:10.196]  Well, I can give a Jefferson quote.
[00:07:10.356 --> 00:07:17.380]  I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution taking from the federal government the power of borrowing.
[00:07:19.958 --> 00:07:20.418]  Absolutely.
[00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:23.100]  Let's take another monetary comment or question.
[00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:27.163]  Let's talk to Mike in Louisiana, then Kyle.
[00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:28.064]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:29.705]  Hello, guys.
[00:07:31.366 --> 00:07:36.730]  I apologize that this question is not particularly monetary.
[00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.711]  It doesn't matter.
[00:07:37.811 --> 00:07:38.391]  Just go ahead.
[00:07:39.072 --> 00:07:47.738]  When the people try to stand up against this tyranny,
[00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:58.187]  I heard last week a caller call in about a website, awrm.org, I believe it was.
[00:07:58.488 --> 00:08:17.444]  I don't have a computer, but my understanding was that there is in place legislation or some kind of whatever to go after the citizen militias and bring them before tribunals.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.061]  And such is that.
[00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.483]  Can you speak to that?
[00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:34.770]  Well, one of the things that's happened good lately is, of course, you're probably familiar with the Supreme Court ruling with respect to owning firearms at home.
[00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.712]  Are you familiar with that that just happened?
[00:08:37.012 --> 00:08:37.152]  Yes.
[00:08:37.192 --> 00:08:38.192]  Holding the Second Amendment?
[00:08:39.373 --> 00:08:39.633]  Yes.
[00:08:39.673 --> 00:08:48.019]  That also, after Katrina, I think they passed legislation here in Louisiana that they couldn't confiscate firearms.
[00:08:49.197 --> 00:08:50.180]  I don't know.
[00:08:55.669 --> 00:09:01.651]  Last week somebody called in and I think he said he was active duty or something.
[00:09:01.851 --> 00:09:11.213]  Well sir, we just covered a bill earlier about the Homegrown Extremist Act where they want to monitor and try to restrict free speech, but the government is a pack of criminals.
[00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:17.254]  They're illegitimate and so no, I'm not aware of that, so I appreciate your call.
[00:09:17.855 --> 00:09:20.355]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kyle in Iowa.
[00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:21.035]  You're on the air.
[00:09:22.636 --> 00:09:22.816]  Hi.
[00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:31.415]  I wanted to make an observation, if I could, about hyperinflation and what that could mean for gold.
[00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:32.776]  Just tell me if I'm wrong, if I am.
[00:09:33.696 --> 00:09:42.460]  I've been studying hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and Hungary and so forth, when prices were doubling literally overnight.
[00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:46.282]  In a situation where you're already currently holding gold,
[00:09:47.142 --> 00:10:01.220]  If your debt isn't dollars, and say the dollar is devalued to like a millionth of its original value, or whatever, couldn't you then in turn, assuming you're able to hold on long enough, actually pay your debt off?
[00:10:02.112 --> 00:10:03.512]  Or, you know, pennies on the dollar.
[00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:04.773]  Yeah, don't get confused.
[00:10:04.913 --> 00:10:11.894]  They're against a gold or silver-backed currency because then it can be manipulated because the bad guys hold the majority of it.
[00:10:12.294 --> 00:10:18.395]  I don't think our guest, and we'll hear it from him in a minute, I wouldn't imagine, because I agree with him on other issues, they seem very intelligent and informed.
[00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:24.737]  We're not saying gold and silver is a bad investment or a bad hedge against inflation.
[00:10:25.177 --> 00:10:26.617]  Right, I wasn't going there either.
[00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:27.297]  Okay, good.
[00:10:27.337 --> 00:10:28.277]  So what is your question?
[00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:30.118]  Well, the point is,
[00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:34.781]  I guess I just want to get my interpretation of this correct.
[00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:41.326]  Is that a possibility where, say, I bought gold at $6.50 an ounce, which I did.
[00:10:42.247 --> 00:10:49.072]  Say, if we do get into a situation like that, because the most I've heard you guys say is like $5,000 an ounce for gold.
[00:10:49.192 --> 00:10:50.713]  Well, that's Bloomberg.
[00:10:50.853 --> 00:10:52.254]  Bloomberg was saying that.
[00:10:53.134 --> 00:10:54.555]  I couldn't imagine it going to that.
[00:10:54.575 --> 00:10:57.037]  If that happens, it means they're going to devalue the dollar to nothing.
[00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:58.238]  But $2,000 is very easy.
[00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:16.666]  Right, but I'm saying, in a situation where we do have hyperinflation, even on the scale of what the Weimar Republic had to where, you know, there were 12 marks to the dollar in 1918 to 1923, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't that 4.2 trillion marks to the dollar?
[00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:21.010]  Well, I know this, Zimbabwe right now has 2 million percent inflation per year.
[00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.753]  Let me get a comment from Bill or Pat on that, both of you.
[00:11:24.315 --> 00:11:26.336]  Well, I mean, the caller is correct.
[00:11:26.536 --> 00:11:44.924]  If you're in debt, and you have hyperinflation, and you have some assets in other forms, like gold, silver, land, or some kind of commodity that's desirable, then absolutely you're a beneficiary of hyperinflation, at least in the short term, because you can sell those assets and pay off your debt for, in effect, pennies on the dollar.
[00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:52.647]  In fact, one of the motives, and one of the reasons that inflation is not purely a bad thing,
[00:11:53.109 --> 00:11:55.977]  It's because the United States is a heavy debtor nation right now.
[00:11:56.438 --> 00:11:59.687]  So as the dollar devalues because we print more and more of it up...
[00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:08.532]  You know, we're in effect paying off foreign creditors for a lesser amount, so there is a silver lining to it in a sense.
[00:12:08.592 --> 00:12:13.633]  But our balance of trade isn't good, so it's going to be a worldwide wrecking ball to economies.
[00:12:14.273 --> 00:12:14.753]  That's right.
[00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:20.415]  Well, China's not going to put up with this much longer.
[00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:24.676]  Somebody is going to cut the dollar loose, and then they're all going to fall within a matter of months.
[00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:26.216]  It's already starting to happen.
[00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:35.925]  And I think both Pat and I agree with the caller that, yeah, commodities, gold and silver, are a great investment.
[00:12:36.085 --> 00:12:38.787]  It's just a horrible thing to base a monetary system on.
[00:12:39.366 --> 00:12:41.367]  Yeah, well I agree with you, and people get confused by that.
[00:12:41.387 --> 00:12:44.869]  I got emails when you were on a few weeks ago going, I thought you said gold's good!
[00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.951]  Yes, we're saying gold's good.
[00:12:46.971 --> 00:12:57.417]  We're saying, though, it is too easy to manipulate as the currency, or having something based on that as the currency, because the elite know it's valuable.
[00:12:57.437 --> 00:12:58.898]  They've been hoarding the daylights out of it.
[00:12:59.764 --> 00:13:18.419]  You know, there's this interesting editorial in the London Times right after Lincoln instituted greenback dollars, which of course was a totally fiat currency, but since he couldn't borrow money to pursue the Civil War, he had to essentially use the old-fashioned way that the colonial America did.
[00:13:18.459 --> 00:13:20.621]  That's just print fiat currency, and it worked great.
[00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:23.002]  But the bankers didn't like it.
[00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:26.145]  This was their editorial in the London Times shortly thereafter.
[00:13:26.678 --> 00:13:36.622]  If this mischievous financial policy, which has its origin in North America, shall become endurated down to a fixture, then the government will furnish its own money without cost.
[00:13:37.002 --> 00:13:39.143]  It will pay off debts and be without debt.
[00:13:39.504 --> 00:13:42.525]  It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce.
[00:13:42.865 --> 00:13:46.306]  It will become prosperous without precedent in the history of the world.
[00:13:46.647 --> 00:13:49.768]  The brains and wealth of all countries will go to North America.
[00:13:50.048 --> 00:13:54.410]  That country must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.
[00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.891]  Yeah, that's a famous quote.
[00:13:55.951 --> 00:13:59.994]  I mean, they cannot allow you to be free, ladies and gentlemen, or our nation to be free.
[00:14:03.336 --> 00:14:05.138]  You're absolutely right, Bill.
[00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:07.079]  In fact, I've got an article here.
[00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:09.401]  The global economy is at the point of maximum danger.
[00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:11.182]  London Telegraph today.
[00:14:11.622 --> 00:14:12.843]  They say it feels like the summer of 1931.
[00:14:13.624 --> 00:14:16.786]  The world's two biggest financial institutions have had a heart attack.
[00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:18.548]  The global currency system is breaking down.
[00:14:18.928 --> 00:14:19.989]  The policy doctrines
[00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:21.730]  I don't see it as a soft landing.
[00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.111]  They see that as their job to try to soften
[00:14:44.608 --> 00:14:47.770]  But the elite won't allow that because that would get rid of their power.
[00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.010]  Right.
[00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.791]  They'll fight it tooth and nail.
[00:15:16.012 --> 00:15:16.772]  They will fight it.
[00:15:17.032 --> 00:15:20.434]  All you have to do is read what happened during the time of Jackson.
[00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:26.277]  How they deliberately crashed the American economy just to try to bring the political pressure on the President.
[00:15:26.297 --> 00:15:27.918]  The President held firm and he beat them.
[00:15:29.559 --> 00:15:32.421]  In fact, they even tried to get the South to revolt that first time.
[00:15:33.922 --> 00:15:38.424]  But luckily he was a Southerner so he could threaten them and explain to them how they were being conned.
[00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:42.527]  But they were not as savvy in the South a few decades later.
[00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:45.752]  Well, that's correct.
[00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:54.996]  And of course, the division of the United States was an absolute necessity because the country was getting too rich.
[00:15:56.516 --> 00:15:57.677]  Yeah, Britain didn't like that.
[00:15:58.037 --> 00:16:09.162]  Pat, can you elaborate on the best case scenario, if we had good people at the helm, what they would do now to extricate ourselves from this certain financial doom?
[00:16:11.383 --> 00:16:18.367]  Well, again, the way the system's set up at the moment, under the Federal Reserve Act and so forth, there's no way out.
[00:16:18.447 --> 00:16:22.710]  There'd have to be monetary reform legislation.
[00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:30.274]  And, you know, the essence of it would have to be that the government creates the money rather than private banks.
[00:16:30.314 --> 00:16:39.420]  So you're talking about, it's just unavoidable, as Bill mentioned, you'd have to reform the Federal Reserve Act and take this power back under the aegis of the government.
[00:16:40.606 --> 00:16:45.691]  Otherwise, you know, ultimately, I mean, what we're doing is what American individuals have done privately.
[00:16:45.751 --> 00:16:47.372]  They've maxed out their credit cards.
[00:16:47.452 --> 00:17:01.164]  And, you know, the American government, by borrowing so much money in the midst of maintaining a war and so on, has simply run us so far into debt and borrowed so much money that, you know, the dollars collapsed.
[00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:04.127]  So they would have to reverse those policies.
[00:17:04.487 --> 00:17:06.749]  And at the present time, I have not heard
[00:17:07.364 --> 00:17:12.367]  A single government representative proposed anything that would cure the present problem.
[00:17:12.787 --> 00:17:14.748]  That's not on the table anywhere.
[00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:23.514]  So it shows like this that have to educate the American people to generate at least, you know, the kind of demand I mentioned that did arise in the 30s.
[00:17:24.174 --> 00:17:31.098]  After all, when people get poorer and poorer, they, you know, they want to understand why and then begin educating themselves about it.
[00:17:31.158 --> 00:17:34.380]  And then they, when they understand what's going on, then they want the right remedies.
[00:17:35.913 --> 00:17:40.142]  So we've got to make sure that the remedy is available for them as this implodes.
[00:17:41.846 --> 00:17:45.967]  And not a false banker's remedy, because they will propose a number of them.
[00:17:46.147 --> 00:17:48.148]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:17:48.288 --> 00:17:50.669]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:17:50.689 --> 00:17:52.930]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.510]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.151]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:00.232]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it wasn't engineered by you?
[00:18:00.252 --> 00:18:06.674]  Alright, let me, uh, John... ...educating themselves about it, and then they, when they understand what's going on, then they want the right remedies.
[00:18:08.246 --> 00:18:12.548]  So we've got to make sure that the remedy is available for them as this implodes.
[00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:18.271]  And not a false banker's remedy, because they will propose a number of them.
[00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:20.451]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:18:20.572 --> 00:18:22.973]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:18:22.993 --> 00:18:25.113]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:18:25.274 --> 00:18:26.794]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:28.455]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:18:28.535 --> 00:18:31.376]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:18:31.436 --> 00:18:35.058]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:18:44.714 --> 00:18:50.756]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:18:50.836 --> 00:18:52.016]  An inside job?
[00:18:53.357 --> 00:18:57.238]  How dare you?
[00:18:57.458 --> 00:19:00.879]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:03.400]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.261]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here.
[00:19:08.141 --> 00:19:09.922]  Truth Rising.

[00:20:18.534 --> 00:20:20.376]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:20:20.516 --> 00:20:27.201]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:35.647]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:20:35.888 --> 00:20:41.592]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:20:41.772 --> 00:20:43.533]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:20:43.613 --> 00:20:45.754]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:20:45.914 --> 00:20:50.157]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:20:50.337 --> 00:20:52.458]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:20:52.538 --> 00:20:59.001]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio.

[00:21:23.794 --> 00:21:27.718]  The real world is hitting us upside the head like a 2x4.
[00:21:27.838 --> 00:21:31.201]  And this is only the start.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.201]  You need to get the DVD.
[00:21:34.261 --> 00:21:37.422]  It's available right now at Infowars.com.
[00:21:37.482 --> 00:21:38.402]  It's the Money Masters.
[00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:41.143]  Three plus hours on one DVD.
[00:21:41.203 --> 00:21:44.845]  It is the preeminent film on the private Federal Reserve.
[00:21:45.725 --> 00:21:48.626]  It is such an easy film to watch.
[00:21:48.726 --> 00:21:51.668]  I can say it's great, entertaining, and powerful.
[00:21:52.088 --> 00:21:53.208]  No, it's edifying.
[00:21:53.768 --> 00:21:55.549]  It's just so well done.
[00:21:58.021 --> 00:22:04.644]  Talk about renaissance men, or I don't know, what's the term for just doing it out of the gates?
[00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:11.226]  Perfect, you know, first film they make, excellent film, classic, you need to have it, revised, updated.

[00:22:45.087 --> 00:22:46.228]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:16.204]  Hey, with this carbon tax, does it sound to you like the superpowers are trying to control industrial growth of third world countries?
[00:23:16.244 --> 00:23:18.024]  Maybe kill the competition, so to speak?
[00:23:18.144 --> 00:23:19.625]  Not just that, it's us first.
[00:23:19.725 --> 00:23:20.785]  Shut down the middle class.
[00:23:20.825 --> 00:23:21.466]  They state it.
[00:23:21.806 --> 00:23:26.647]  So your common sense is what... Manufacturing and industrial jobs are gone in this country, no doubt about it.
[00:23:26.667 --> 00:23:28.508]  Well, they want that last 20% gone.
[00:23:28.768 --> 00:23:34.470]  This is predatory, monopoly, crony capitalism that we are discussing.
[00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.311]  Let me get a comment from Pat and Bill on that.
[00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:39.472]  Oh yeah, you're absolutely right.
[00:23:39.492 --> 00:23:45.235]  This whole Kyoto Carbon Tax thing is aimed at a dagger square at the heart of America.
[00:23:45.275 --> 00:23:46.175]  That's what it's all about.
[00:23:47.736 --> 00:23:48.536]  Okay, thanks a lot guys.
[00:23:48.556 --> 00:23:48.936]  Appreciate it.
[00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:49.797]  Alright, thank you.
[00:23:49.817 --> 00:23:50.737]  I mean, they state it.
[00:23:50.797 --> 00:23:53.719]  It's not like... I want new listeners to understand something.
[00:23:54.642 --> 00:24:01.427]  They've declared their hatred and their enmity and their wanton destruction of us, just like earlier Bill read that quote.
[00:24:01.767 --> 00:24:06.230]  Bill, read that quote again where they said we've got to destroy the free market system of the U.S.
[00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.792]  We've got to destroy their own government issuing the currency.
[00:24:10.133 --> 00:24:11.914]  If this is allowed to happen, it's all over.
[00:24:12.814 --> 00:24:13.055]  Sure.
[00:24:13.095 --> 00:24:15.616]  This was an editorial in the London Times.
[00:24:16.217 --> 00:24:22.221]  It was right after Lincoln instituted greenback money, which is basically government-issued money, just like we propose.
[00:24:22.714 --> 00:24:37.311]  This is what it said, quote, if this mischievous financial policy, which has its origin in North America, shall become endurated, which means perpetuated down to a fixture, then the government will furnish its own money, oh gosh, without cost.
[00:24:37.871 --> 00:24:40.234]  It will pay off debts and be without debt.
[00:24:40.354 --> 00:24:40.995]  Oh my goodness!
[00:24:41.579 --> 00:24:44.622]  It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce.
[00:24:44.682 --> 00:24:48.505]  It will become prosperous without precedent in the history of the world.
[00:24:49.045 --> 00:24:51.988]  The brains, the wealth of all countries will go to North America.
[00:24:52.048 --> 00:24:56.592]  That country must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.
[00:24:59.028 --> 00:25:01.029]  So they financed the war between the states.
[00:25:01.069 --> 00:25:05.770]  They tried it in the 1830s and failed, but got what they wanted just 25 years later.
[00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:11.752]  Gentlemen, we will be back in just 70 seconds for the fourth and final hour.

[00:26:47.037 --> 00:26:47.398]  We're good.
[00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:18.676]  Imagine my frustration over the years, knowing who the New World Order is, knowing their fraud, how they got control of the world by buying off politicians and having them tell the public that their Federal Reserve, their Bank of England, was the government when it wasn't.
[00:27:20.457 --> 00:27:25.719]  To know they're behind the social engineering, the stage wars, the stage terror, they're behind it all, their think tanks brag about it.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.962]  They're behind the cancer industry.
[00:27:30.984 --> 00:27:32.685]  They're behind all the scams, everything.
[00:27:32.705 --> 00:27:38.888]  They're just a pack of hardcore, ruthless, bloody terrorists who are psychopaths.
[00:27:39.448 --> 00:27:46.072]  See, most psychopaths aren't like John Wayne Gacy dressing up like a clown or Ted Bundy running out in a yellow Volkswagen.
[00:27:46.772 --> 00:27:49.854]  They go and they want to wear uniforms, go study criminology.
[00:27:49.894 --> 00:27:50.834]  They want to get power.
[00:27:51.155 --> 00:27:52.295]  They want to become bankers.
[00:27:52.315 --> 00:27:53.396]  They want to become senators.
[00:27:53.436 --> 00:27:55.097]  They want to become generals.
[00:27:55.777 --> 00:28:01.762]  Where they can, these are controlled, disciplined psychopaths, and it's just a wonderland.
[00:28:01.822 --> 00:28:06.867]  And then they've dumbed the public down, the public's running around drooling, literally, having no idea what's going on.
[00:28:06.887 --> 00:28:12.532]  If we are unable to warn the people about what's happening, they're going to do their purges here.
[00:28:13.339 --> 00:28:18.562]  You know, we've got this light at the end of the tunnel that our guests are offering us, and it's a great solution.
[00:28:18.903 --> 00:28:28.649]  Monetary Reform Act they're proposing, and is well-researched and reasoned, and will work historically in the context of our current problems we face, current challenges.
[00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:38.576]  Or you've got the other side of the tunnel that is a freight train going to roll over you, going 100 miles an hour, and where they bring in a police state to protect their criminal consolidation.
[00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:42.931]  Most countries are enslaved.
[00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.711]  Most countries turn into despotisms.
[00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:54.375]  The elites would rather have a giant mass of third world slaves than have a free market good system that's based on just weights and measures.
[00:28:55.716 --> 00:29:07.681]  We're going to continue with Todd, Rick, Bronco, and others, but let's start getting into any areas that we've mentioned, because I've talked to you all, Fair Pat, and some you, Bill, areas that both of you think are important.
[00:29:08.021 --> 00:29:13.223]  I mean, you talked about individual things families can do now to protect themselves, Pat.
[00:29:14.264 --> 00:29:16.385]  What do you have to say, Bill?
[00:29:16.465 --> 00:29:22.468]  Not just your Monetary Reform Act, but how do we help individuals now with what we're facing?
[00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:36.914]  Well, to me, you've got to draw a sharp distinction between the fake solutions that are out there and the precise solution that we have developed.
[00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.212]  We don't speak in generalities.
[00:29:39.292 --> 00:29:41.213]  We know precisely what to do.
[00:29:41.573 --> 00:29:44.776]  This can be instituted even in a matter of weeks.
[00:29:44.856 --> 00:29:49.259]  We say the transition period would take a year, but that's just not to alarm people.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:58.987]  In fact, you could institute it very, very quickly and put the country instantly on a firm financial footing and put a stop to all this stuff.
[00:29:59.605 --> 00:30:02.028]  You know, I just want to read one more Lincoln quote.
[00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:19.428]  About five months from the end of his life, when he saw how the bankers were attempting to destroy his attempts at government-issued money, he put it this way, I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country.
[00:30:19.864 --> 00:30:21.487]  Corporations have been enthroned.
[00:30:21.547 --> 00:30:24.071]  An era of corruption in high places will follow.
[00:30:24.371 --> 00:30:33.526]  The money powers of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands.
[00:30:33.928 --> 00:30:36.110]  And the Republic is destroyed.
[00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:41.674]  Because, after all, isn't that the essence of our political experiment here in America?
[00:30:42.074 --> 00:30:46.657]  It's the essence of the Constitution, and yet it's never mentioned in the Constitution.
[00:30:46.997 --> 00:30:49.219]  It's the separation of powers concept.
[00:30:49.499 --> 00:30:50.200]  What is that?
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:56.744]  That spreads power, both political and financial, out very broadly among a bunch of people.
[00:30:57.065 --> 00:31:01.588]  That makes the government of this country very unwieldy, very slow.
[00:31:01.788 --> 00:31:02.849]  But that's a good thing!
[00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:05.573]  It's also very, very safe.
[00:31:05.593 --> 00:31:08.235]  That's what democratizing is all about.
[00:31:08.596 --> 00:31:13.039]  And that's what's being destroyed by money being aggregated into a few hands.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.342]  Yeah, you want that separation of power.
[00:31:17.283 --> 00:31:19.085]  Sorry, go ahead, Pat.
[00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:22.307]  Well, I think Bill's really gotten to the essence of this.
[00:31:22.327 --> 00:31:25.150]  The separation of powers was to do precisely that.
[00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:30.915]  Because, you know, we know Lord Acton's quote that all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:44.095]  And so, you know, the founding fathers of the United States being quite well aware of that and having witnessed the negative effects of the concentration of power in England through the Bank of England, which they were well aware of, that was the vehicle for it.
[00:31:45.304 --> 00:31:54.250]  They divided these powers, you know, there were senators and congressmen and three branches of government and they split it all up so that it couldn't be aggregated.
[00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:57.752]  That was to bind the hands of the avarice that was in the average man.
[00:31:57.792 --> 00:32:13.321]  They understood that to actually use the corruption and wickedness fighting with each other to make the object where the elites would always be fighting with each other and it would take so much time to get control that people would die off and so it was kind of a stopgap.
[00:32:14.124 --> 00:32:19.287]  That's exactly correct, but they didn't fully understand money.
[00:32:19.387 --> 00:32:22.249]  They simply didn't understand monetary theory well.
[00:32:22.729 --> 00:32:30.333]  So there's some fatal flaws that weren't addressed as well as they could have been in the Constitution.
[00:32:30.353 --> 00:32:34.536]  And that weak point is precisely where the bankers have focused.
[00:32:34.556 --> 00:32:40.019]  They originally used Alexander Hamilton, who was their agent in the United States.
[00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:41.419]  He was from Jamaica originally.
[00:32:41.439 --> 00:32:42.400]  A lot of people don't know that.
[00:32:43.198 --> 00:32:51.880]  And back then, you know, we mentioned less than five of these struggles against these national banks, these central banks in the United States.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:33:09.244]  Going back early in our history, and the most recent one, of course, being against this cartel of banks called the Federal Reserve System, which basically united the major banks into a cabal to control the economic power of the country.
[00:33:09.284 --> 00:33:12.465]  But that's the way they got around this separation of powers.
[00:33:17.341 --> 00:33:17.621]  Bill?
[00:33:19.402 --> 00:33:22.683]  Yes?
[00:33:22.743 --> 00:33:24.443]  Sure, comments on what Pat was just saying.
[00:33:26.064 --> 00:33:27.944]  Well, that's exactly right.
[00:33:29.525 --> 00:33:45.050]  I would just urge that people beware as the political will amongst the populace begins to arise sufficiently so that politicians know that something radical must be done.
[00:33:45.649 --> 00:33:54.695]  There are already solutions that they, I'm sure, have as contingency plans that are waiting in the wings that they're going to roll out.
[00:33:55.275 --> 00:34:01.380]  I believe one of those is a return to a gold-backed money, and that's a false solution.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:09.345]  Those people who propose a return to a gold-backed money typically speak in generalities, do not speak in specifics.
[00:34:09.813 --> 00:34:13.494]  Because there really is nothing specific that you can do.
[00:34:13.874 --> 00:34:16.635]  Gold-backed money failed during the Great Depression.
[00:34:16.695 --> 00:34:18.555]  We were on gold-backed money then.
[00:34:18.915 --> 00:34:20.036]  That's not the problem.
[00:34:20.676 --> 00:34:31.759]  The problem is we have to democratize money as much as possible, which means it can only be issued by the federal elected officials closest to the population.
[00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.759]  Yes, they're rascals.
[00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:35.940]  Yes, they'll print too much money.
[00:34:36.508 --> 00:34:46.174]  But, if that is the primary, the primary political issue every single year, how much money have you printed, then we can... Yes, yes, yes.
[00:34:46.274 --> 00:34:48.255]  We have to be in control of it or somebody else will.
[00:34:48.295 --> 00:34:50.216]  Hold on, we're going to come back to the full audience right now.
[00:34:50.236 --> 00:34:51.177]  Here we go.
[00:35:01.023 --> 00:35:02.284]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:03.385 --> 00:35:08.147]  We are continuing our discussion with the makers of the Money Masters film.
[00:35:11.369 --> 00:35:13.029]  Pat Carmack and Bill Still.
[00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.431]  Your phone calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:35:18.872 --> 00:35:22.994]  I want to debate some of the different systems of monetary reform.
[00:35:25.828 --> 00:35:26.108]  I think?
[00:35:45.689 --> 00:36:02.155]  The reform that I believe is going to be rammed through, because they've said it's the one they're planning, is a re-monetize the dollar under a North American larger system, tying it into the Euro, and then a world central banking regulatory expansion of power.
[00:36:02.915 --> 00:36:11.898]  They're now saying this, as we said years ago they would, it's my prediction, not hard to predict, that they would say, we've had these problems with bad lenders, give the central banks, the big banks,
[00:36:12.478 --> 00:36:32.974]  The power to go shut down smaller banks and control other groups and different types of lending organizations and we'll fix all the predatory lending and they run lots of PR pieces bashing little money cashing places and you know smaller loan sharks but never talking about themselves and that they're going to have a worldwide system
[00:36:34.932 --> 00:36:51.064]  Where it's a basket of different scams they run, but where they don't even have a world currency at first, they just set in regions what they say that currency is worth, and then they inflate or deflate, but it will always be inflate.
[00:36:51.744 --> 00:37:21.044]  uh... at their leisure for whatever helps them squeeze the domestic population but also to set the foundations of a global tax uh... and a global regulatory system while they have the regional blocks they're gonna make you and they said this by carbon credits on what you exhale even the new york times said a tax on breathing was the headline a year ago and they're gonna tax you there your car your home new environmental enforcers a new environmental guild uh... to carry all this out so i see that
[00:37:21.884 --> 00:37:23.605]  As the system they're going to push.
[00:37:23.665 --> 00:37:33.709]  Now, it is true that Ron Paul, who I agree with on 98% of things, you know, he has the kind of the Austrian school and believes in gold and silver because you can't manipulate it.
[00:37:33.729 --> 00:37:35.750]  And he says, well, it'll always be manipulated if you don't.
[00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:41.812]  The problem is, as our guests say, they, the globalists, own most of the gold and silver so they can manipulate that too.
[00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:47.395]  I agree with the power of a fiat currency, but an educated public about it, transparent government,
[00:37:47.955 --> 00:38:03.608]  Getting money out of the equation where it's just an agreed-upon mode of exchange to accelerate true commerce and business and free market, instead of always allowing whoever it is to manipulate and control the fiat currency in private hands.
[00:38:03.788 --> 00:38:08.492]  So if you want to talk about Ron Paul's views and disagree with those, that's fine, or add to it.
[00:38:08.652 --> 00:38:11.714]  I just think that we tend to get in a fight, you know, monetary
[00:38:12.705 --> 00:38:16.614]  Researchers and reformers arguing about the gold system.
[00:38:17.155 --> 00:38:18.117]  I disagree with you.
[00:38:20.794 --> 00:38:26.758]  I'm thinking, Bill, that it's going to be a gold-silver system that's pushed.
[00:38:26.798 --> 00:38:27.959]  We're going to find out real soon.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:49.674]  We have seen them announce it is going to be the regional system pegged and controlled by a new global regulatory authority with the private banks, not just controlling government and issuing currency and credit and liquidity, but now becoming world government and then, as I said, phasing in the global tax through the carbon tax and also carbon credit and trading.
[00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:52.156]  I want to get your comment on that, Bill, and then Pat.
[00:38:52.996 --> 00:38:58.698]  Point out that they have to disguise it so that it doesn't sound like a world currency.
[00:38:58.798 --> 00:39:03.801]  Americans will revolt at that.
[00:39:04.121 --> 00:39:10.283]  Nations in general, especially in America, they will have to disguise this tremendously.
[00:39:10.323 --> 00:39:14.065]  That's why I think ultimately this will fail and they'll have to go to some sort of gold
[00:39:14.913 --> 00:39:26.138]  I mean, we're really debating what the basis of the monetary system is not nearly as important as other basic reforms, and I'd like Pat to speak to that.
[00:39:26.178 --> 00:39:26.938]  He's the expert.
[00:39:28.019 --> 00:39:41.885]  Well, I don't know that I'm the expert, but it's certainly true that the nature of the reserve, whether it's gold or silver or some other commodity or fiat, that doesn't matter nearly as much as who
[00:39:42.475 --> 00:39:47.279]  Gets to create the money that that base is used for as a base.
[00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:59.329]  So if 90% of the money is created by private banks, and it's a fiat currency, that's no worse or no better than if they create 90% of the money if the base is gold.
[00:39:59.869 --> 00:40:10.898]  So a lot of people who want to put in a gold or silver or some other commodity as a monetary base don't understand that that's only a small part of the problem.
[00:40:12.252 --> 00:40:13.272]  It certainly is true.
[00:40:13.872 --> 00:40:22.515]  I don't want to be totally against gold and silver in every respect, because as you mentioned earlier, Alex, private ownership's a good thing, because your U.S.
[00:40:22.555 --> 00:40:25.275]  dollars you're holding in your savings account are worth less every day.
[00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:33.117]  So on a private basis, it's a good form to have some diversification into gold, silver, and even other commodities, for that matter.
[00:40:33.769 --> 00:40:38.351]  But the fundamental reform that has to happen is fractional reserve banking has to be abolished.
[00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:41.793]  And all that really means is private creation of money has to be abolished.
[00:40:42.293 --> 00:40:53.158]  And another example of that isn't just fractional reserve banking, it's banks or even credit card companies selling as securities bundles of credit card debt.
[00:40:53.198 --> 00:41:00.921]  I mean, that's another form where it's not just classical banks doing it now, it's just all sorts of groups running around doing it, correct?
[00:41:01.505 --> 00:41:02.666]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[00:41:02.706 --> 00:41:04.047]  There's new forms of money.
[00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:11.751]  You know, credit card debt has expanded the money supply outside of the control system of the, you know, fractional reserve banking.
[00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:13.973]  So, it's just another scam.
[00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:15.994]  Private banks have created that money.
[00:41:16.034 --> 00:41:17.215]  They created it as debt.
[00:41:17.655 --> 00:41:21.898]  They let you incrementally add to your credit card debt, and they simply create that.
[00:41:22.098 --> 00:41:26.080]  You know, the government is involved in any way, so that should be abolished as well.
[00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:30.463]  Ultimately, money must be created by the people.
[00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:36.532]  Through their representatives and not by these private bankers who are concentrating all wealth in their hands.
[00:41:37.172 --> 00:41:45.739]  You know, I mentioned last time the UN has estimated repeatedly each year how many people own as much as the poorest half of the world, so roughly 3 billion people.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:56.048]  The number's gone from roughly 350 people a decade ago to around 200 people now own as much as 3 billion, the 3 billion poorest.
[00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:59.271]  That has to be stopped and the vehicle that's causing that is
[00:41:59.747 --> 00:42:01.028]  Private creation of money.
[00:42:02.489 --> 00:42:13.237]  Well, I agree with you, but earlier you were talking about how you have this cabal or you have this combine.
[00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:18.401]  What was the particular term you used for the private group of banks that are the Federal Reserve?
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.361]  Well, it's a cartel or a cabal.
[00:42:20.441 --> 00:42:21.462]  Cartel, cartel.
[00:42:22.362 --> 00:42:23.783]  And this really is a cartel.
[00:42:24.563 --> 00:42:33.749]  And imagine how dumb the elite think the general public is that in college and in school and in life, still,
[00:42:34.955 --> 00:42:45.122]  If you say the Federal Reserve is private and is a cartel, when they describe themselves as a cartel when it's founding, that you're told it doesn't exist and Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't exist.
[00:42:45.162 --> 00:42:58.712]  Now, the good news is most people now know that was a lie and a fraud, but that's how masterful these people are, is that we've now had a 98-year debate about whether it's private or not.
[00:42:59.591 --> 00:43:08.921]  When it was always private, instead of, do we want private banks controlling the issuance of currency and credit, which then allows them to buy up the whole economy?
[00:43:08.942 --> 00:43:15.909]  I mean, this is like saying, can Alex Jones call himself Federal Reserve Bank of Austin, Texas, and then I'm the only one you can get money from?
[00:43:15.969 --> 00:43:20.234]  I mean, I would obviously take over the town in a matter of years, and they have.
[00:43:21.115 --> 00:43:23.836]  You know, so many listeners email me and say, why does this even matter?
[00:43:23.896 --> 00:43:29.218]  Folks, this is carnival show charlatans that have done all of this.
[00:43:29.838 --> 00:43:30.718]  Comment on that, Pat.
[00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:33.019]  Well, yeah, it's the Wizard of Oz.
[00:43:33.039 --> 00:43:42.983]  You throw back the curtain and you see, you know, the reality is there's this rather weak, ignorant man who's really manipulating the whole system with smoke and mirrors.
[00:43:43.043 --> 00:43:43.943]  And that's what we've got.
[00:43:44.323 --> 00:43:47.084]  The Federal Reserve sits on the mall in Washington.
[00:43:47.742 --> 00:43:53.764]  Along with all the government buildings, everybody assumes, well, this is another government agency, and it's not.
[00:43:53.944 --> 00:44:02.847]  You know, it's privately owned, and it operates to maintain, preserve, protect this cartel, not the American economy.
[00:44:02.867 --> 00:44:03.608]  You want evidence?
[00:44:03.928 --> 00:44:06.088]  Read the paper about what's happening in the American economy.
[00:44:06.709 --> 00:44:12.211]  How many of your listeners are working 20% less than they did, say, 10 years ago?
[00:44:12.851 --> 00:44:14.091]  Or 30% less?
[00:44:14.131 --> 00:44:16.052]  How many of them are less productive, and so on?
[00:44:16.658 --> 00:44:20.699]  In other words, we're all working harder, we're producing more and more, yet we're poor.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:27.082]  The average American is poorer than 20 years ago, despite all of our great natural resources and so on.
[00:44:27.142 --> 00:44:37.485]  We have not had natural disasters that account for the economic situation we find ourselves in now, or this gradual erosion of the middle class.
[00:44:37.505 --> 00:44:41.306]  We're becoming like the Mexicans, where they have triple the resources the U.S.
[00:44:41.346 --> 00:44:42.947]  has, but are totally poor.
[00:44:43.507 --> 00:44:45.508]  We are getting a dirtbag elite.
[00:44:46.204 --> 00:45:00.195]  If I could break in, what is the most outrageous single point that people could take away here is that 99% of the population does not realize that when you go to your bank and you take out a loan
[00:45:00.834 --> 00:45:04.337]  Which is 90% of the money in circulation in the United States.
[00:45:04.638 --> 00:45:06.780]  That money was created out of nothing.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:13.646]  They have the monopoly power to just create it out of nothing and then have the gall to charge us interest on it.
[00:45:13.886 --> 00:45:15.147]  That's what the system is.
[00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:16.829]  That's why they're getting rich.
[00:45:16.849 --> 00:45:18.250]  That's why we're getting poor.
[00:45:19.751 --> 00:45:21.393]  We may loan it to our government.
[00:45:21.413 --> 00:45:23.475]  The government gives them the right to print it.
[00:45:24.279 --> 00:45:28.260]  Uh, or created electronic keyboards, and then they loan it to the government at interest.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.921]  And the government's paying over $400 billion in interest.
[00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:32.822]  Well, obviously, that ought to be stopped.
[00:45:33.642 --> 00:45:38.544]  And, uh, it's by the policy of obfuscation of this fact that the public's kept ignorant of it.
[00:45:38.804 --> 00:45:39.584]  How did they do that?
[00:45:39.644 --> 00:45:41.705]  They used part of that money to buy the media.
[00:45:42.145 --> 00:45:48.527]  If you look up the ownership of the major media in this country, since the 1920s, it's been owned predominantly by banks.
[00:45:48.627 --> 00:45:49.927]  It's almost exclusive now.
[00:45:49.947 --> 00:45:52.468]  So the only place you can get the truth about this matter
[00:45:52.972 --> 00:45:59.770]  It shows like this one on the internet and so forth, but most people take all their information from either the
[00:46:01.445 --> 00:46:14.830]  And now we're kicking the butt of the mainstream media, so the feds are coming out and saying we're going to end net neutrality and basically shut down the old web, and you're not going to have websites, you'll have a few thousand establishment sites that you can visit.
[00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:16.070]  You know, they've now announced that.
[00:46:17.171 --> 00:46:18.131]  God help us, man.
[00:46:18.171 --> 00:46:23.733]  We've got a break here, you can take a few minutes off, and we're going to come back and talk more about this, and take calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:46:23.853 --> 00:46:25.494]  Todd, Rick, Bronco, and many others.
[00:46:31.144 --> 00:46:32.245]  It's just so amazing.
[00:46:32.906 --> 00:46:35.188]  The police are out writing tickets because they think they're broke.
[00:46:35.228 --> 00:46:35.909]  The government's broke.
[00:46:35.949 --> 00:46:36.549]  It's not broke.
[00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:37.811]  The banks own it all.
[00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:38.912]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:47.344 --> 00:46:53.086]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:46:53.426 --> 00:46:59.027]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:03.208]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:47:03.508 --> 00:47:08.450]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:16.132]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.
[00:47:17.032 --> 00:47:17.492]  That's right!
[00:47:47.452 --> 00:47:51.653]  Would you like to know how you can use water as fuel and laugh at the rising price of gas?

[00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:38.441]  Or call 239-628-3708.
[00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:42.303]  That's 239-628-3708.
[00:48:43.824 --> 00:48:44.504]  Call today.
[00:48:45.985 --> 00:48:58.712]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:48:59.132 --> 00:49:02.954]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:49:03.254 --> 00:49:03.735]  We're good to go.
[00:49:29.377 --> 00:49:29.677]  Let's do it.
[00:49:47.475 --> 00:49:48.536]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:49:48.937 --> 00:49:54.424]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:49:54.984 --> 00:49:55.485]  That's right.
[00:49:55.805 --> 00:49:58.088]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:49:58.408 --> 00:50:05.577]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:50:06.124 --> 00:50:13.813]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:50:14.274 --> 00:50:19.120]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.764]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:25.543 --> 00:50:29.668]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:50:30.068 --> 00:50:30.329]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:32.251]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:50:32.331 --> 00:50:32.632]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:50:32.652 --> 00:50:33.212]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:50:49.557 --> 00:50:50.797]  We're good to go.
[00:51:16.661 --> 00:51:21.208]  I wanted to point out that they give the states unfunded mandates.
[00:51:22.229 --> 00:51:25.594]  Say the feds will fund it for one, two, three years, four years sometimes.
[00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:30.982]  And then after the laws that they get the states to pass with federal lobbyists down here,
[00:51:32.788 --> 00:51:34.390]  Say that the states then have to fund it.
[00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:40.655]  And so, you know, they triple, quadruple the number of police, and they're going to go out and write you tickets.
[00:51:40.675 --> 00:51:42.517]  You go one mile over the speed limit, they're going to do it.
[00:51:42.977 --> 00:51:45.859]  Neighbors see you yell at your child, they're going to CPS your child.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.402]  I mean, it's all a predatory state.
[00:51:49.262 --> 00:51:56.429]  In the international banks, you wonder how it could be in Germany, or Australia, or Russia, or England, or Canada.
[00:51:56.529 --> 00:51:58.650]  It's all the same laws, same names.
[00:51:59.171 --> 00:51:59.952]  It's global.
[00:52:00.777 --> 00:52:10.380]  And when you read the Federal Reserve Information, the Club of Rome Info, the Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission, it's all, this is for the administrative convenience of the international banks.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.221]  That's their words.
[00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:16.502]  And so, you wonder why your school's a police station?
[00:52:17.142 --> 00:52:18.863]  You wonder why you're treated like a slave?
[00:52:18.923 --> 00:52:21.043]  They're getting their property in line.
[00:52:21.663 --> 00:52:22.944]  This is a plantation.
[00:52:24.093 --> 00:52:25.434]  And you are a slave.
[00:52:25.494 --> 00:52:27.095]  Now, it's all done by fraud.
[00:52:27.135 --> 00:52:28.456]  They just made it up out of nothing.
[00:52:29.197 --> 00:52:31.699]  But this is life and death info.
[00:52:32.199 --> 00:52:38.844]  You know, I can't stress Pat Carmack and Bill Still how this affects people's everyday life.
[00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:43.067]  I mean, the point you were making, Bill, about how the banks just make it up out of nothing.
[00:52:43.147 --> 00:52:46.249]  It's all fraud, and they don't want you to pay it back.
[00:52:46.629 --> 00:52:50.372]  That's where they get real assets, and people don't understand that.
[00:52:50.392 --> 00:52:51.273]  Can you explain that to them?
[00:52:53.223 --> 00:53:00.166]  99% of the population, I'm telling you right now, does not realize when they go to the bank and take out a loan where that money comes from.
[00:53:00.266 --> 00:53:01.947]  They just made it up.
[00:53:02.347 --> 00:53:07.109]  They have the right to just make the money up and loan it to us at interest.
[00:53:07.229 --> 00:53:17.994]  And that's why they want a worldwide cashless society because then they're going to outlaw barter and other forms so that they can really reduce money supplies and really rape us.
[00:53:18.034 --> 00:53:18.374]  Go ahead.
[00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:22.852]  Well, I've got a 1933 Franklin Roosevelt quote.
[00:53:23.193 --> 00:53:25.154]  This was a letter to a confidant.
[00:53:25.174 --> 00:53:26.075]  He wrote it this way.
[00:53:26.095 --> 00:53:35.303]  He said, the real truth of this matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.
[00:53:35.804 --> 00:53:38.666]  So that goes to Pat's point about ten minutes ago.
[00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:44.752]  Yeah, one of the points Milton Friedman made about
[00:53:45.174 --> 00:53:54.077]  Why is it that we should advocate, and Alex, you pointed out, well, if the control of the bankers is so great, why discuss these reform measures and all?
[00:53:54.117 --> 00:53:55.737]  Well, Friedman offered two reasons.
[00:53:55.837 --> 00:54:05.180]  One of them is, he said, it's worth discussing radical changes or reform, not in the expectation that they will be adopted promptly, but for two other reasons.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:11.322]  One is to construct an ideal goal so that incremental changes can be judged by whether they move
[00:54:12.045 --> 00:54:15.808]  The institutional structure toward or away from that ideal.
[00:54:15.828 --> 00:54:21.033]  So there he's saying, you know, it may not happen in a huge reform act.
[00:54:21.073 --> 00:54:24.376]  It may be many little acts that are in response to public demand.
[00:54:25.117 --> 00:54:27.579]  The other one is, the other reason he says is very different.
[00:54:27.619 --> 00:54:38.509]  It is so that if a crisis requiring or facilitating radical change does arise, alternatives will be available that have been carefully developed and fully explored.
[00:54:39.073 --> 00:54:39.413]  Well, absolutely.
[00:55:04.686 --> 00:55:08.687]  I still think even some of the audience out there don't realize the stakes here.
[00:55:09.288 --> 00:55:11.708]  Because these bankers are making themselves gods.
[00:55:11.788 --> 00:55:13.409]  Forget enthroning themselves.
[00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:17.330]  I mean, they are just absolutely on power trips.
[00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.651]  And Bill, the squeezing has only begun.
[00:55:21.912 --> 00:55:29.694]  Is it going to be hard for you to sit there and watch the people carrying out the execution of our economy, posing as saviors, being worshipped on television?
[00:55:30.014 --> 00:55:31.155]  I know that's always hard on me.
[00:55:32.031 --> 00:55:34.573]  Well, I've been watching it for 14 years now.
[00:55:34.653 --> 00:55:48.861]  It's just amazing to me that it's taken so long to actually get to this point, but I had no idea that they could really pump so much money into the system before it collapsed, and so that's why it's taken so long.
[00:55:50.319 --> 00:55:52.281]  Well, they wanted us hyper-extended.
[00:55:52.341 --> 00:55:53.342]  I mean, that's another point here.
[00:55:53.822 --> 00:55:57.546]  The whole system is designed to want to get people in debt.
[00:55:57.566 --> 00:56:03.311]  That's why when you're a guy working for six bucks an hour in college, you get a credit card three or four times a week in the mail.
[00:56:03.331 --> 00:56:06.955]  But when you're not in debt, you get credit card offers twice a year.
[00:56:07.595 --> 00:56:08.997]  This incentivizes
[00:56:11.604 --> 00:56:16.886]  Major banks are making big money off of this real estate run-up, and that's the major economic factor.
[00:56:17.147 --> 00:56:17.727]  Well, exactly.
[00:56:17.747 --> 00:56:18.427]  That's what I was going to say.
[00:56:18.467 --> 00:56:24.390]  It incentivizes getting people in debt and making bad loans, which then the taxpayer bails out.
[00:56:25.471 --> 00:56:26.471]  Let's skip this break.
[00:56:26.491 --> 00:56:29.473]  Let's just keep talking right now with all the callers.
[00:56:29.513 --> 00:56:29.913]  Here we go.
[00:56:35.248 --> 00:56:36.929]  Okay, I'm going to skip that break, folks.
[00:56:36.989 --> 00:56:37.990]  I do that sometimes.
[00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:49.836]  I'm here for TheInfoWars.com audio streams, and the people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, the AM and FM listeners and Shreve listeners, do not get to hear these behind-the-scenes interviews, but it's just too important to not waste time.
[00:56:50.717 --> 00:56:54.179]  Let's go ahead and talk to Todd, Rick, Bronco, and others.
[00:56:54.639 --> 00:56:57.581]  Todd in Ohio, you're on the air with the makers of the Money Masters.
[00:56:58.821 --> 00:57:01.683]  Yeah, I have two questions for Bill and Pat if there's time.
[00:57:02.538 --> 00:57:07.620]  First question, I've been telling people for years that we need a debt-free fiat money system.
[00:57:08.021 --> 00:57:19.325]  Now the objection that I usually get is that the government is so untrustworthy that if you gave them this power that within a few years you'd have runaway hyperinflation and all these horrible things would happen.
[00:57:19.566 --> 00:57:25.248]  But they have given the power to their private banker body so it's even worse with no transparency.
[00:57:26.229 --> 00:57:26.589]  Go ahead.
[00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:27.889]  Absolutely.
[00:57:27.929 --> 00:57:28.550]  Simple answer.
[00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:29.390]  Very simple answer.
[00:57:29.881 --> 00:57:30.381]  Go on.
[00:57:30.721 --> 00:57:32.182]  And that is, yes, that's true.
[00:57:32.502 --> 00:57:34.423]  However, they are electable.
[00:57:34.563 --> 00:57:39.646]  And the current people who control the quantity of money in the system are not electable.
[00:57:39.726 --> 00:57:44.868]  I think the biggest issue is education, because the public doesn't know how this works.
[00:57:44.969 --> 00:57:46.149]  And that, I think, is the first.
[00:57:46.169 --> 00:57:47.070]  That's why you made the film.
[00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:48.370]  But I'm going to shut up, Todd.
[00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:49.311]  Go ahead and finish your question.
[00:57:50.591 --> 00:57:57.895]  Yeah, well, I was going to say, the response I usually give to that is that the fact that the government is currently untrustworthy.
[00:57:59.069 --> 00:58:09.716]  That no more justifies keeping money issuance in private hands than it does turning the power to declare war over to private companies like Halliburton and Blackwater.
[00:58:10.317 --> 00:58:13.779]  But what it does demonstrate is that we also need election reform.
[00:58:13.799 --> 00:58:26.689]  So my first question is, would you agree that in order for monetary reform to be implemented properly, that we as a people must insist upon a simultaneous reform of our election system?
[00:58:27.492 --> 00:58:32.434]  Well, they own the electoral process, so I mean, monetary reform would take care of that.
[00:58:32.514 --> 00:58:35.855]  Whether or not you have to have the cart before the horse, I don't know.
[00:58:35.955 --> 00:58:38.516]  I'd leave that to Pat's better judgment.
[00:58:39.577 --> 00:58:43.358]  Well, I mean, obviously both should be worked on simultaneously.
[00:58:43.378 --> 00:58:49.361]  There's no reason to focus exclusively on one type of reform when more than one is needed.
[00:58:50.256 --> 00:58:54.877]  You know, anything that will make it a more democratic process, that's fine and we should work for that.
[00:58:54.917 --> 00:58:57.398]  At the same time, we should work for monetary reform.
[00:58:58.318 --> 00:59:06.860]  You know, if I can say something else, in a way this boils down to whether or not you are a believer in democracy or plutocracy.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:14.902]  If you believe in democracy, you have to believe that the electoral process can work correctly.
[00:59:15.322 --> 00:59:19.183]  And so therefore, the elected representatives of the people should have
[00:59:19.676 --> 00:59:25.259]  The most important power of government, according to Lincoln, namely the monetary power, in their hands.
[00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:36.225]  If you don't believe in elected government, then you believe in plutocracy, which is the current system whereby the bankers make their own rules about how much money they can create.
[00:59:37.886 --> 00:59:40.267]  Yeah, there's the other, another element of it, too.
[00:59:40.307 --> 00:59:44.289]  It's, you know, not all politicians, obviously, are equally corrupt.
[00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:45.750]  I'll tell you what, Pat, stay there, stay there.
[00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:47.111]  We're coming back out to the main audience.
[00:59:47.131 --> 00:59:47.411]  Here we go.
[00:59:54.926 --> 00:59:55.747]  It's very simple.
[00:59:55.807 --> 00:59:59.109]  We have private banking families, and not your bank down the street.
[01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.050]  The big banks.
[01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:02.932]  JPMorgan Chase.
[01:00:05.354 --> 01:00:06.074]  And a few others.
[01:00:06.594 --> 01:00:07.775]  The Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[01:00:07.815 --> 01:00:10.177]  That's who owns the stock in those companies.
[01:00:10.217 --> 01:00:12.939]  That's who dominates and controls that private stock.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:15.881]  They are cold-blooded.
[01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:16.822]  They are predatory.
[01:00:18.095 --> 01:00:20.756]  And so we can debate what monetary reform we want.
[01:00:20.816 --> 01:00:25.237]  Their reform is more banker control, world regulation, world tax on carbon.
[01:00:26.277 --> 01:00:30.238]  Just totally going from out of the frying pan into hell.
[01:00:30.378 --> 01:00:32.379]  I mean, you know, getting deeper into their system.
[01:00:32.419 --> 01:00:38.241]  Kind of like a boa constrictor eating a monkey saying, here, I'll help you, let me just get your tail finally down my gullet.
[01:00:38.681 --> 01:00:40.921]  Instead of the monkey, you know, trying to fight its way out.
[01:00:42.582 --> 01:00:42.782]  So,
[01:00:44.079 --> 01:00:45.660]  We can debate this all day long.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:49.202]  We were just now talking behind the scenes there for Infowars.com stream listeners.
[01:00:49.322 --> 01:00:50.403]  You've got to go to the streams, folks.
[01:00:50.423 --> 01:00:53.545]  We're listening to another stream on the web somewhere, and you're not hearing the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[01:00:53.565 --> 01:00:56.426]  You've got to go to Infowars.com and listen to those streams.
[01:00:57.447 --> 01:01:01.169]  We were just now discussing that, and it's a no-brainer.
[01:01:01.709 --> 01:01:04.671]  The central banks, the private families, own most of the gold and silver.
[01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:05.952]  It's a great investment.
[01:01:05.972 --> 01:01:08.673]  You need to be in it, because that beats the fiat currencies.
[01:01:08.793 --> 01:01:11.355]  But the problem is, if they come up with that monetary reform,
[01:01:12.842 --> 01:01:17.446]  Of now, oh, let's get off that and go to this, that puts us right back under their control.
[01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:22.169]  Now, I disagree with Bill Still, who's a very smart guy.
[01:01:22.189 --> 01:01:35.260]  I mean, certainly he's right about that and they could propose it, but I have already seen them propose the regionally controlled, with a world authority over all banks and financial institutions, and to introduce you to the tax,
[01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:42.627]  Oh, it's a carbon environmental tax that they don't want to call a tax, but you buy it from the central bank.
[01:01:42.727 --> 01:01:43.568]  So, that's it.
[01:01:43.628 --> 01:01:44.809]  We know what they're going with.
[01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:55.621]  The next big global bubble that will be the final bubble is controlling and taxing all carbon that is put off by all carbon-based life forms.
[01:01:56.081 --> 01:01:57.502]  So this is taxing you to breathe.
[01:01:57.522 --> 01:02:01.865]  You're going to have your own bureaucrat assigned to you that inspects your home on a monthly basis.
[01:02:02.406 --> 01:02:03.406]  I mean, it's so hellish.
[01:02:03.907 --> 01:02:04.847]  It's not my opinion.
[01:02:05.168 --> 01:02:08.170]  So when this all happens, don't say, oh my God, Alex, you were psychic again.
[01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:09.270]  It's all stated.
[01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:11.372]  So we're having some debate.
[01:02:11.992 --> 01:02:13.053]  Are you still there, Todd?
[01:02:13.073 --> 01:02:14.034]  I am.
[01:02:14.734 --> 01:02:17.056]  I mean, try to finish up your point of what you're trying to say.
[01:02:17.957 --> 01:02:20.198]  Well, actually, I'd finish my first point.
[01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:24.121]  My second point has to do with inflation, which you talk about a lot.
[01:02:24.818 --> 01:02:35.524]  And I often hear it implied, though it's never really stated in so many words, that the problem with our current dollar crisis, monetary crisis, is that we have too much money chasing too few goods.
[01:02:36.064 --> 01:02:41.628]  Well, I happen to have a copy of the Truth in Money book, which is quoted in the Money Masters documentary.
[01:02:41.648 --> 01:02:42.548]  Right.
[01:02:42.588 --> 01:02:49.252]  And one of the key phrases in there is that... Are you still there?
[01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:50.733]  Yeah, it's a great book.
[01:02:51.821 --> 01:02:59.264]  Yeah, what I was going to say is one of the key phrases in there is that we have a, quote, built-in shortage of money, end quote.
[01:02:59.324 --> 01:03:01.625]  And the reason we have a built-in shortage is two reasons.
[01:03:03.265 --> 01:03:10.528]  Number one is whenever the bank loan is repaid, or the principal of a bank loan is repaid, that money vanishes.
[01:03:11.248 --> 01:03:11.989]  It's uncreated.
[01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:16.130]  And the second reason... Yeah, but that's why they always want more debt!
[01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:20.912]  Right, but the interest, the money needed to pay the interest is never created.
[01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:30.026]  And so if everyone got out of debt, all the money supply would vanish, but there would still be billions and all this compounding interest debt.
[01:03:30.526 --> 01:03:43.110]  So we have a built-in shortage of money, and so that's why I'm always arguing with people that hiking the interest rate is a false solution, because that's just going to drive the wedge even further between the outstanding interest debt and the money that's out there to pay it off.
[01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:44.310]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:47.191]  Long-term, that's not a fundamental solution at all.
[01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:49.352]  Or even a partial solution.
[01:03:49.372 --> 01:03:50.192]  Well, that's right.
[01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:52.236]  Yeah, you're correct.
[01:03:54.037 --> 01:04:10.866]  So, again, what needs to be done is that our money needs not to be created by private banks that we must borrow, so that it's created with an equivalent amount of debt, for which, you're also correct, there isn't also money created for the interest.
[01:04:11.446 --> 01:04:19.750]  So, right away, there's a shortage of money in the general economy, because it's all bearing interest.
[01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:21.311]  It has to be paid by someone.
[01:04:21.761 --> 01:04:41.688]  Yeah, so we have to abolish that system, and it has to be created not as debt, but as the act of the sovereign state, and used simply to pay for the goods and services the state needs for the benefit of the common good for the general population.
[01:04:42.568 --> 01:04:47.730]  Well, one last point if there's time, in case you didn't know, somebody mentioned the Wizard of Oz earlier, I think it was Bill.
[01:04:48.537 --> 01:04:59.883]  There's a book out called Web of Debt by Ellen Brown, came out last year, and in that book she talks about how the Wizard of Oz, the original book that was written, not the movie, was actually an allegory for monetary reform.
[01:05:00.223 --> 01:05:00.864]  That's correct.
[01:05:01.144 --> 01:05:04.886]  The ruby slippers were actually silver slippers in the book, denoting... That's right.
[01:05:05.486 --> 01:05:06.767]  Right, so on the Yellow Brick Road.
[01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.668]  Yeah, on the Yellow Brick Road was the gold standard and so forth.
[01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:10.409]  That's correct.
[01:05:10.469 --> 01:05:16.592]  By the way, Ellen Brown wrote an endorsement of the Money Masters, which appears on our website.
[01:05:18.122 --> 01:05:18.863]  But she's correct.
[01:05:19.023 --> 01:05:21.004]  She quotes the Money Masters at length in her book.
[01:05:22.365 --> 01:05:23.625]  So that's all I have to say.
[01:05:23.645 --> 01:05:23.925]  Thank you.
[01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:25.466]  Thank you.
[01:05:25.606 --> 01:05:29.848]  Let's take some more calls, but before we do that, we don't have time to screw around.
[01:05:29.908 --> 01:05:32.029]  You need to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:05:32.049 --> 01:05:34.010]  That way you support us and the filmmakers.
[01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:39.673]  We have it for $19.95, and it is just hour after hour after hour.
[01:05:39.693 --> 01:05:41.954]  I haven't timed it out.
[01:05:42.014 --> 01:05:43.675]  Exactly how long are the two discs?
[01:05:45.317 --> 01:05:47.538]  I haven't timed it out.
[01:05:48.359 --> 01:05:49.620]  Three hours, 23 minutes.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.402]  Yeah, three hours, 23 minutes.
[01:05:52.062 --> 01:05:56.266]  And can I make a point about gold-backed money?
[01:05:56.566 --> 01:05:57.667]  Sure, we'll do that in just a moment.
[01:05:57.727 --> 01:06:01.109]  Right now, I just want people to know how they can get this bill.
[01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:03.932]  The Money Masters at Infowars.com.
[01:06:03.972 --> 01:06:05.493]  How the banks create the world's money.
[01:06:05.953 --> 01:06:10.497]  And I'll just plug it before the show ends, but people should know it's available at Infowars.com.
[01:06:10.537 --> 01:06:11.358]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:06:12.378 --> 01:06:24.207]  Yeah, well, for those who think that there's so much gold in the system that it can't be controlled, you know, back, what, in the early 1970s, the Hunt brothers, they were not even major players on the New York scene.
[01:06:25.294 --> 01:06:31.200]  The newly created electronic trading to corner the silver market, which is much more vast than the gold market.
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:36.725]  Two, you know, smaller fish down in Texas were able to corner the market.
[01:06:36.745 --> 01:06:39.327]  They had to change their exchange rules to beat them.
[01:06:39.368 --> 01:06:44.953]  So don't tell me that it can't be cornered, these commodity markets can't be cornered by wealthy individuals.
[01:06:46.517 --> 01:06:48.098]  Absolutely, they do it all the time.
[01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:56.125]  And again, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, here is the film, The Money Masters, and inside you have the two discs, close to three and a half hours.
[01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:59.087]  In there, there's a nice little booklet that comes with it.
[01:06:59.407 --> 01:07:07.574]  Quite a price, $19.95 at Infowars.com for the two-CD set, the three-hour, 23-minute film in the booklet.
[01:07:08.594 --> 01:07:16.138]  I just want you to have this, and folks, of course you can find some scratchy copy on the web, and that's great for folks that aren't in contact with the DVD.
[01:07:16.979 --> 01:07:23.762]  These are great films, like Endgame, or Terror Storm, or my new film that I just put out that needs to be seen.
[01:07:23.782 --> 01:07:29.005]  It's so good on the DVD, Truth Rising, or the film that these guys made, The Money Masters.
[01:07:29.725 --> 01:07:33.308]  I mean, you also need to support those that are putting out this type of information.
[01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:38.352]  So, go to InfoWars.com, get the DVD today of the Money Masters.
[01:07:39.253 --> 01:07:41.355]  Let's go back to the calls here.
[01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:44.417]  Rick in New Hampshire and then Bronco and others.
[01:07:44.457 --> 01:07:45.038]  Go ahead, Rick.
[01:07:45.839 --> 01:07:46.399]  Hello, Alex.
[01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:46.960]  Can you hear me?
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:47.380]  Yes, sir.
[01:07:48.066 --> 01:07:51.047]  Okay, that was just a wicked static interruption there.
[01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.128]  Now that's the way phone systems sound.
[01:07:53.428 --> 01:08:05.473]  The Telos, the classic, one of the most popular phone system in talk radio, to let you know, because they're designed for fans of talk radio, it goes... When you're actually... That's what it did.
[01:08:05.493 --> 01:08:10.836]  Yeah, that's just a standard sound that a Telos system in talk radio makes.
[01:08:10.856 --> 01:08:11.216]  Go ahead.
[01:08:11.736 --> 01:08:14.777]  I was expecting a big Louie to come through the mouthpiece here.
[01:08:15.218 --> 01:08:15.818]  Alright, man.
[01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:20.456]  Hey, Bill Still, it's a pleasure to hear your voice.
[01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:22.958]  Is this book, The New World Order, written in 1990?
[01:08:23.318 --> 01:08:23.858]  Is this you?
[01:08:24.879 --> 01:08:25.619]  Yeah, that's me.
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:26.820]  Well, thank you.
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.541]  This is the first New World Order book.
[01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:29.301]  What's that?
[01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:31.703]  That was the first New World Order book.
[01:08:32.123 --> 01:08:32.543]  That's right.
[01:08:32.583 --> 01:08:33.964]  This is the first one I read, too.
[01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:36.446]  And I still enjoy it for reference.
[01:08:36.466 --> 01:08:40.328]  But anyway... It beat Ralph Everson's book out by about three months.
[01:08:41.089 --> 01:08:41.669]  Right, right.
[01:08:42.492 --> 01:08:48.295]  Well, it certainly helped me a lot, and I still have it, and it's one of my permanent pieces there.
[01:08:49.156 --> 01:08:49.736]  Let's see.
[01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.859]  You know, that Monetary Reform Act, that goes back over ten years now, right?
[01:08:54.899 --> 01:08:55.879]  That's in the end of your film.
[01:08:55.959 --> 01:09:00.722]  I've seen your film at least a dozen times, by the way, and I love it, and I've showed it to dozens and dozens of people.
[01:09:00.762 --> 01:09:01.682]  Oh, it's amazing.
[01:09:02.443 --> 01:09:05.745]  Everybody gets through the Monetary Reform Act, and they say, okay, well, what happened?
[01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:06.305]  What happened?
[01:09:07.031 --> 01:09:09.174]  Yeah, yeah, Pat wrote it about 12 years ago.
[01:09:09.234 --> 01:09:14.019]  Pat's an attorney, and so he's the intellectual brains behind this operation.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:25.713]  So, I mean, basically, it's one of the good ideas that's, you know, in the run for hopeful reform someday, right?
[01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:27.068]  Well, that's right.
[01:09:27.108 --> 01:09:36.243]  Well, yeah, and never has we had such a chance, you know, political pressure built at such a point where reform is now for the first time possible.
[01:09:36.443 --> 01:09:37.785]  Yeah, Rick, thanks for the call.
[01:09:39.833 --> 01:09:43.997]  How did Ron Paul, or have you ever talked to Ron Paul, receive your ideas, Pat?
[01:09:45.018 --> 01:09:47.081]  I've tried to meet with him.
[01:09:47.161 --> 01:09:54.428]  I went out and spoke to a conference of his in Phoenix about a year ago, specifically because I thought he was going to be there so I could talk to him personally.
[01:09:54.829 --> 01:09:56.771]  We've visited his office.
[01:09:56.811 --> 01:09:58.753]  He's never met with us face-to-face.
[01:09:59.372 --> 01:10:02.515]  There's a lot of folks claim Ron Paul is going to be places when he's not.
[01:10:03.215 --> 01:10:04.336]  That's a problem out there.
[01:10:04.376 --> 01:10:10.161]  So when he really does actually come to an event, a lot of folks don't show up thinking, well I thought it was another one of the events where they just claim he's going to be there.
[01:10:10.842 --> 01:10:18.649]  Let's talk some about the film in detail, because we mentioned it's a great film, but for those that haven't seen the three hours plus,
[01:10:19.309 --> 01:10:20.791]  Well, it basically goes through the history of
[01:10:43.008 --> 01:10:49.794]  Fractional Reserve Banking from time immemorial, from the time of Christ, actually, is when we start.
[01:10:50.535 --> 01:10:53.297]  And it just builds a case.
[01:10:53.377 --> 01:10:57.240]  It's the same thing over and over and over again through history.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:04.186]  And then when we get to American history and you can start quoting Franklin and Jefferson and Madison, it's the same thing.
[01:11:04.286 --> 01:11:09.971]  Eventually these people, there are people in every generation who figure it out.
[01:11:10.652 --> 01:11:31.205]  And it's the same thing, and it just builds, I believe, an indisputable case for what we're trying to put across, that the only solution for this problem is to take the power to create the quantity of money in this country away from the private bankers, which is the situation we have today, and place it into the hands of the Congress of the United States.
[01:11:31.966 --> 01:11:39.851]  Yeah, going back even to the time of Caesar, there were, you know, there were patricians who, as Bill said, they understood
[01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:51.701]  That if they could get the power to create money, I mean, you know, there's even fairy tales about it, like the goose that laid the golden egg, you know, and we've talked a minute ago about the Wizard of Oz and so forth.
[01:11:52.381 --> 01:11:55.482]  It's people understand that it's not a hard concept.
[01:11:55.722 --> 01:12:03.665]  If I'm the only fellow in the country that can create money, and I can create it on a keyboard or with a printing press, then I'm going to ultimately control the whole country.
[01:12:03.725 --> 01:12:05.105]  So if what you're after is power,
[01:12:05.748 --> 01:12:07.089]  Then that's the vehicle to do it.
[01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:08.770]  And people have understood this over and over again.
[01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:11.551]  As soon as they understand it, they don't want anybody else to understand it.
[01:12:11.772 --> 01:12:19.176]  Well, tell the viewers, some of the people that... In fact, since you raised that, as soon as people understand it, they don't want anybody else to understand it.
[01:12:19.716 --> 01:12:32.504]  That's what's so ridiculous of all the founders and all these different presidents and Lincoln and Jackson and wars and editorials and the National Banking Association a hundred years ago saying, too many Americans read, buy up.
[01:12:32.904 --> 01:12:34.425]  The newspapers dumb them down.
[01:12:34.845 --> 01:12:43.631]  I mean, it's all public to anyone who's informed, but then we have a population a hundred years under their brainwashing, who can't even find Iraq on a map, but say, kill them all.
[01:12:44.271 --> 01:12:45.172]  You know, they don't understand.
[01:12:45.212 --> 01:12:51.075]  They're the target of these bankers too, and these bankers got sold on eugenics a hundred years ago, so they're carrying that out everywhere.
[01:12:51.095 --> 01:12:52.716]  That's another issue I cover in Endgame.
[01:12:53.237 --> 01:12:54.677]  It's just, this is everything.
[01:12:55.338 --> 01:13:01.922]  And then to be called conspiracy theorists, because you can read newspaper articles from the time of Andrew Jackson.
[01:13:04.628 --> 01:13:05.868]  It's a pocketbook issue.
[01:13:06.228 --> 01:13:12.050]  The reason you don't have as much money in your pocket right now as you did ten years ago is because of this issue.
[01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:17.312]  If you don't like that, then you should watch the video and figure out how to fix it.
[01:13:17.352 --> 01:13:19.493]  There's a simple fix for this problem.
[01:13:19.553 --> 01:13:22.514]  That's what's so incredible is you guys really do have a beautiful plan.
[01:13:23.074 --> 01:13:26.176]  And it really does work, and it's what our government is designed to do.
[01:13:26.516 --> 01:13:27.876]  It's what's in the Constitution.
[01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:29.457]  It's what the founders first did.
[01:13:30.477 --> 01:13:32.458]  And it's what Julius Caesar did, for God's sake.
[01:13:32.498 --> 01:13:34.159]  That's what the Roman Empire was built on.
[01:13:34.179 --> 01:13:35.320]  See, we just can't have that.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.762]  We've got to let some dirtbag scammers run and rule and make us slaves.
[01:13:40.162 --> 01:13:54.469]  I know a lot of listeners are just saying, you're laughing right now, a lot of neocons are listening, a lot of liberals, you just can't wake up, the government's not your mommy and your daddy, and you've got to wake up that the Federal Reserve is at your pally, wow, and you're just not going to figure it out.
[01:13:54.989 --> 01:13:57.511]  And so I just want you later to know that we, I guess,
[01:13:58.624 --> 01:14:01.126]  You know, sometimes I think we don't have hope, but we actually do have a lot of hope.
[01:14:01.146 --> 01:14:02.207]  A lot of people are waking up.
[01:14:02.267 --> 01:14:03.448]  It's just so obvious.
[01:14:03.768 --> 01:14:14.597]  Does it ever make you want to tear your hair out, Bill and Pat, to know how obvious and simple this is, but that business people I talk to, maybe you run into it, just can't grasp it?
[01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:26.766]  Well, actually, business people often do when you explain it to them, but, you know, again, this money has been used to control the media, and rather than reading books as we did a hundred years ago in this nation,
[01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:38.100]  And, you know, reading perhaps hundreds of books, if not thousands in a lifetime, most of the information we now get is from, you know, three or four news, massive news media.
[01:14:38.521 --> 01:14:48.108]  So the means of controlling the information to the average American has been radically made easier for the bankers.
[01:14:48.468 --> 01:14:54.653]  And that's one of the things that, you know, we have to deal with now is that the media is so limited.
[01:14:55.523 --> 01:15:00.634]  Unfortunately, again, there's these alternative media, but they reach, obviously, a smaller percentage of the people.
[01:15:02.742 --> 01:15:03.243]  Well, you're right.
[01:15:03.283 --> 01:15:12.652]  That's why more and more I realize, as I said 12 years ago, pirate FM, as it's known, micro-FM, you know, 10 watts, 100 watts, picking up satellite feeds of shows like this.
[01:15:14.113 --> 01:15:25.224]  But it's a handful of people that are willing, even though most of the time you never even get a civil letter from the FCC, as long as you're not interfering with other stations, especially in rural areas, it's very easy to
[01:15:25.925 --> 01:15:29.807]  They're not willing to step up, and they don't understand the animating contest of liberty.
[01:15:30.168 --> 01:15:33.430]  It's also exciting and fun to stand up against this scum.
[01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:34.670]  Let's take another call.
[01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:36.531]  Let's talk to Bronco in Toronto.
[01:15:36.571 --> 01:15:37.372]  Go ahead, Bronco.
[01:15:38.953 --> 01:15:39.193]  Hello?
[01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:40.214]  Yes, Bronco.
[01:15:40.574 --> 01:15:41.334]  How are you, Alex?
[01:15:41.655 --> 01:15:41.895]  Good.
[01:15:43.596 --> 01:15:44.616]  Calling from Canada.
[01:15:44.636 --> 01:15:48.339]  I was just wondering, you were talking about the influence of
[01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:50.525]  The U.S.
[01:15:50.565 --> 01:15:52.188]  economic meltdown and the Fed.
[01:15:52.769 --> 01:15:54.432]  You have your same private bank up there.
[01:16:04.659 --> 01:16:08.583]  You know, food prices have gone up, the real estate bubble here hasn't collapsed yet.
[01:16:08.603 --> 01:16:09.503]  Well, let me tell you why.
[01:16:09.664 --> 01:16:17.511]  You'd think you're not on the dollar, you're on the loonie, so why has it gone from below the dollar past the dollar, you know, parity, and now past it?
[01:16:18.412 --> 01:16:24.397]  About 70% of the fuel increase is dollar devaluation, and the rest is speculation on dollar fears.
[01:16:24.798 --> 01:16:27.280]  You see, worldwide, everyone's rushing into commodities.
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:33.522]  Because the world reserve currency is dying and everybody's trying to quietly get out of their dollars before it collapses.
[01:16:33.862 --> 01:16:37.063]  And so that's the main thing driving that and that's what's hurting your economy.
[01:16:37.143 --> 01:16:39.644]  Can I speak to this Canadian guy?
[01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:39.984]  Yeah.
[01:16:40.024 --> 01:16:43.565]  You know, there's a great Canadian who discovered the truth.
[01:16:43.605 --> 01:16:45.726]  His name was Jerry McGeer in about 1935.
[01:16:45.866 --> 01:16:46.826]  He was in the parliament.
[01:16:50.817 --> 01:16:59.280]  And he fought the bank tooth and nail, and just go to Google and look up Jerry McGeer and some of his quotes.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.401]  He was a wonderful Canadian and he knew the truth.
[01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:03.942]  This is one of his quotes.
[01:17:04.002 --> 01:17:11.184]  They were the men interested in the establishment of the gold standard and the right of the bankers to manage the currency and credit of every nation in the world.
[01:17:11.464 --> 01:17:16.666]  With Lincoln out of the way, they were able to proceed with that plan and did proceed with it in the United States.
[01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:24.210]  Within eight years after Lincoln's assassination, silver was demonetized and the gold standard money system was set up in the United States.
[01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:25.251]  And he goes on and on.
[01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:26.872]  He was just so right on.
[01:17:26.912 --> 01:17:27.472]  Stay there!
[01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:28.673]  Stay there, Bronco!
[01:17:28.693 --> 01:17:36.839]  I want to let you talk some more during this behind-the-scenes segment only for InfoWars.com audio stream listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:17:37.399 --> 01:17:40.541]  Okay, we're going to come back in the final segment for everybody else, but this is too important to skip.
[01:17:40.941 --> 01:17:43.443]  Get over there right now to the InfoWars.com streams, folks.
[01:17:43.663 --> 01:17:44.224]  Alright, here we go.
[01:17:46.246 --> 01:17:48.408]  Okay, Bronco, did you have anything else you wanted to say?
[01:17:49.208 --> 01:17:54.412]  Yes, I was just going to mention that I've seen the movie and the documentary.
[01:17:54.452 --> 01:17:55.593]  It was really, really good.
[01:17:55.613 --> 01:17:57.295]  I've seen your documentary, your new one.
[01:17:58.215 --> 01:18:12.527]  I was just going to state the fact that I remember in the documentary it mentioned Nathan Rothschild, and he said he doesn't really care who the political leaders of a country are as long as he's in charge of the money issue.
[01:18:13.908 --> 01:18:14.128]  Pardon me?
[01:18:14.864 --> 01:18:15.064]  Correct.
[01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:18.008]  As long as he gets to control the quantity of money.
[01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:21.032]  We've got a radio talk show host up here in Toronto.
[01:18:21.052 --> 01:18:22.214]  His name is Richard Serret.
[01:18:22.254 --> 01:18:23.355]  He's talked about this too.
[01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:25.278]  I think you've been on his show, Alex, before.
[01:18:26.091 --> 01:18:28.272]  He brought this whole issue up too.
[01:18:28.472 --> 01:18:30.872]  Yeah, I've been everywhere, man.
[01:18:31.352 --> 01:18:33.613]  I've been everywhere, man, like the Johnny Cash song goes.
[01:18:33.633 --> 01:18:36.653]  I've been on search, I think, about ten times over the years.
[01:18:36.693 --> 01:18:37.194]  Good guy.
[01:18:40.534 --> 01:18:48.236]  But listen, if you appreciated the Money Masters, if you appreciated Truth Rising, well, you didn't give me your review of Truth Rising, what did you think of it?
[01:18:48.436 --> 01:18:50.097]  Oh, it was fantastic.
[01:18:50.257 --> 01:18:50.898]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:18:51.138 --> 01:18:53.920]  My film's all free on Google, and I want you to use it and see it.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:59.004]  But at PrisonPlanet.tv, you can burn high-quality ones to disk and give them to people.
[01:18:59.184 --> 01:19:03.006]  So go there, or get the DVDs at InfoWars.com.
[01:19:03.067 --> 01:19:04.007]  Get the Money Master.
[01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:04.928]  Show it to people.
[01:19:05.388 --> 01:19:06.529]  Oh, I do, I do.
[01:19:06.589 --> 01:19:07.089]  Believe me, I do.
[01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:10.891]  I was just going to ask you, what other movies are you coming out with?
[01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:12.791]  What other documentaries are you working on?
[01:19:12.951 --> 01:19:37.197]  I'm doing one on the mass extermination program from All Their Documents, kind of an in-game two, I'm not sure, where we just show all the chemical, biological, radiological, declassified thefts, grabbing foster children, frying them in radiation chambers, murdering Native Americans, sterilizing them, sterilizing Native Americans, killing, it's in your news, killing young children on the Native American reservations under eugenics operations through the church in Canada.
[01:19:37.777 --> 01:19:44.201]  Just so people understand that the bankers... Do you expect me to talk, Mr. Bond?
[01:19:44.241 --> 01:19:45.321]  No, we expect you to die.
[01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:47.342]  I mean, this is all the way.
[01:19:47.402 --> 01:19:50.984]  This is full metal jacket death.
[01:19:51.705 --> 01:19:52.805]  And I'm working on that.
[01:19:52.865 --> 01:19:54.266]  Also one on JFK.
[01:19:54.346 --> 01:19:55.607]  The case is basically closed.
[01:19:56.207 --> 01:20:06.053]  Showing how they killed him, why they did it, and that goes into the bankers and the Federal Reserve as well, so that's kind of a Federal Reserve slash JFK, but inter-JFK, really kind of Federal Reserve.
[01:20:06.633 --> 01:20:15.539]  But that's cinema verite, like Truth Rising, no voiceover, no nothing, just pure film, like you just saw with Truth Rising.
[01:20:15.559 --> 01:20:17.840]  But thank you so much for the call, my friend.
[01:20:20.137 --> 01:20:26.740]  Okay, gentlemen, we're going to come back to the main broadcast with only a few minutes left, and I appreciate you spending an hour and fifty minutes with us today.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:34.883]  In a few months, I want to get you back up again to track what's happening with the economy, and I can only commend both Pat and Bill.
[01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:38.104]  Gentlemen, I hope you've enjoyed talking to our audience.
[01:20:39.045 --> 01:20:39.605]  We haven't.
[01:20:39.865 --> 01:20:41.206]  Thank you so much for having us on.
[01:20:41.386 --> 01:20:41.646]  You bet.
[01:20:41.666 --> 01:20:42.646]  We're not done yet, though.
[01:20:42.746 --> 01:20:43.446]  One more rodeo.
[01:20:43.486 --> 01:20:43.827]  Here we go.
[01:20:51.343 --> 01:20:54.525]  And they're going down like a dinosaur!
[01:20:54.825 --> 01:20:57.386]  Yeah!
[01:20:57.426 --> 01:21:04.970]  They used to grow corn in Kansas.
[01:21:07.651 --> 01:21:12.953]  Total Control.
[01:21:14.774 --> 01:21:17.195]  A Control Freak Wonderland.
[01:21:17.335 --> 01:21:18.256]  The DVD.
[01:21:18.776 --> 01:21:20.217]  Three hours, twenty-three minutes.
[01:21:24.192 --> 01:21:25.753]  Got a little booklet and everything.
[01:21:25.813 --> 01:21:29.194]  1995infowars.com right now.
[01:21:30.155 --> 01:21:32.076]  While you're there, get Truth Rising.
[01:21:32.976 --> 01:21:34.937]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[01:21:34.957 --> 01:21:39.879]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[01:21:40.559 --> 01:21:42.560]  Better get that through your head.
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.161]  This world is ruled by violence.
[01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:49.023]  This world is ruled by violence.
[01:21:49.103 --> 01:21:50.864]  But I guess that's better left unsaid.
[01:21:51.852 --> 01:21:54.694]  Alright, we're out of time with our guest, again, the Money Masters, 888-253-3139.
[01:21:54.715 --> 01:21:56.296]  888-253-3139 or 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:21:56.336 --> 01:22:01.120]  Get the film, get the Monetary Reform Act that is in the film and in a booklet within the film.
[01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:01.760]  Just absolutely amazing
[01:22:20.791 --> 01:22:21.991]  You need to have it, folks.
[01:22:22.031 --> 01:22:25.232]  I mean, I don't know how to push you or drive you to expose these bastards.
[01:22:25.692 --> 01:22:27.072]  Spread the truth with everybody.
[01:22:27.952 --> 01:22:30.293]  Gentlemen, it's been great to have both of you on.
[01:22:30.373 --> 01:22:34.273]  I want to thank you for spending time with us, Pat Carmack and Bill Still.
[01:22:34.773 --> 01:22:38.334]  In closing, do you think we're going to have a depression and how far off do you think it'll be?
[01:22:41.054 --> 01:22:41.455]  Go, Pat.
[01:22:42.995 --> 01:22:45.675]  Well, of course, you know, again, we're talking about definitions.
[01:22:45.755 --> 01:22:46.695]  It'll be shifted around.
[01:22:46.915 --> 01:22:50.256]  So, you know, to put it, you know, just common sense terms.
[01:22:50.595 --> 01:22:52.717]  Will the economy worsen from what it is now?
[01:22:53.197 --> 01:22:54.378]  I think that's pretty certain.
[01:22:55.478 --> 01:22:58.801]  To predict how long it will last is very perilous.
[01:22:58.881 --> 01:23:02.283]  It's hard to know, because it does involve the political order at that point.
[01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:07.667]  It has to do with whether or not there's wars going on, or whether or not new wars happen, and so on.
[01:23:07.727 --> 01:23:09.328]  And that, I can't predict.
[01:23:09.368 --> 01:23:13.691]  But it appears wars will accelerate that, but regardless, who knows what's going to happen.
[01:23:13.711 --> 01:23:14.472]  30 seconds, Bill.
[01:23:17.542 --> 01:23:19.685]  Yeah, I don't see us coming out of this at all.
[01:23:19.965 --> 01:23:21.987]  This is a death spiral.
[01:23:22.007 --> 01:23:26.391]  We're not going to come out of it until monetary format gets passed.
[01:23:26.411 --> 01:23:27.833]  We're just going to go down and down and down.
[01:23:28.013 --> 01:23:29.555]  There's not going to be a two-year bottom.
[01:23:29.615 --> 01:23:31.617]  It's an infinite bottom until this is done.
[01:23:32.495 --> 01:23:33.736]  Folks, know who to blame.
[01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:35.038]  The globalists, the bankers.
[01:23:35.098 --> 01:23:35.779]  They're the enemy.
[01:23:35.819 --> 01:23:36.439]  They did it all.
[01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:37.440]  They're the fraudsters.
[01:23:37.781 --> 01:23:39.503]  They're the magicians that scammed you.
[01:23:39.823 --> 01:23:40.464]  Wake up now.
[01:23:40.524 --> 01:23:41.445]  Admit you were conned.
[01:23:41.485 --> 01:23:45.589]  Police and military and others that think you're part of the establishment, check into what we've covered here.
[01:23:45.889 --> 01:23:47.291]  Gentlemen, thank you for spending time with us.
[01:23:48.072 --> 01:23:49.153]  Thank you so much for having us.
[01:23:49.793 --> 01:23:50.674]  You bet, gentlemen.
[01:23:50.714 --> 01:23:51.075]  God bless.
[01:23:51.095 --> 01:23:51.816]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:23:51.856 --> 01:23:52.797]  Folks, I am out of time.
[01:23:54.595 --> 01:23:58.699]  Retransmission starts on the internet in about a minute and a half at InfoWars.com.
[01:23:58.739 --> 01:23:59.739]  I had Dr. Corcion.
[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:02.402]  I covered a bunch of news in the first hour as well.
[01:24:02.702 --> 01:24:07.386]  If you missed any of the first two hours of the show, you've been tuned in the last two hours or the last five minutes.
[01:24:07.866 --> 01:24:10.828]  Everything continues at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:17.474]  And with the sponsor of the day, the only sponsor we have today, we have sponsors throughout the week, is InnerFood.
[01:24:18.475 --> 01:24:22.498]  They are just fabulous folks that I wanted to tell you about just briefly.
[01:24:24.329 --> 01:24:31.350]  There's actually a couple sponsors, but I'm just thanking them today because they're such a great company, and we just appreciate them so much.
[01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:41.132]  Innerfood.com, and then of course, efoodsdirect.com, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:24:41.272 --> 01:24:48.633]  High quality, freeze-dried and dehydrated food, lasts more than 10 years in climate control, 10 years in your barn or shed.
[01:24:49.173 --> 01:24:52.554]  It's in metal cans, so it's all dried in there.
[01:24:53.194 --> 01:24:54.655]  It's dehydrated, so there's a ton of it.
[01:24:54.695 --> 01:24:56.756]  High quality, with all this craziness going on.
[01:24:57.077 --> 01:24:58.197]  Food prices exploding.
[01:24:58.638 --> 01:25:00.579]  Give them a call.
[01:25:00.599 --> 01:25:00.759]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:25:00.779 --> 01:25:00.939]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:25:00.959 --> 01:25:04.782]  It's where I've gotten my horrible foods.
[01:25:04.822 --> 01:25:05.422]  I believe in them.
[01:25:05.783 --> 01:25:07.344]  Or eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:25:07.464 --> 01:25:08.785]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:25:09.245 --> 01:25:11.807]  Giant banners at the top of Infowars.com.
[01:25:14.028 --> 01:25:14.849]  God bless you all.
[01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:17.070]  Great job to the network and the folks out here in Austin.
[01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:18.691]  All the listeners and the sponsors.
[01:25:19.011 --> 01:25:22.453]  Retransmission in T-minus 70 seconds.
[01:25:22.593 --> 01:25:25.235]  Be there at the InfoWars.com streams.
[01:25:25.275 --> 01:25:25.975]  God bless you all.
