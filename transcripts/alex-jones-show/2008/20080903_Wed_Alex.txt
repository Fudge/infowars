[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.770]  He was put in prison.
[00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:09.292]  A lot of the other, one of the core allies of Russia, if you want to call it that.
[00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:10.952]  It's almost inseparable.
[00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:14.813]  Half of Ukraine is ethnic Russians on the eastern part.
[00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:21.495]  They suddenly become a candidate to join NATO in 2004 with this Orange Revolution.
[00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.396]  And the same thing in Georgia.
[00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:47.419]  Then, on top of that, in January 2007, the Bush administration announces that it is requesting the government of Poland and the government of the Czech Republic to install what it calls an anti-missile defense system, including missiles in Poland and radar installations in the Czech Republic.
[00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:54.400]  To protect against possible rogue nuclear missile attacks from Iran.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.361]  Which is ridiculous.
[00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:59.004]  You would have those in Turkey, or you'd have those in Israel, which are already there.
[00:00:59.065 --> 00:01:07.453]  It's really, according to the former head of Star Wars, Dr. Bob Bowman and others we've interviewed, it's really a sneak attack weapon so you can nuke Russia as NATO's
[00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:08.133]  Precisely.
[00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:10.355]  This, in the kernel, is what I talk about in Full Spectrum Dominance.
[00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:36.744]  Not surprisingly, Russia is reacting to this.
[00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:40.452]  They say, oh, step back a little bit, Washington.
[00:01:41.274 --> 00:01:41.755]  Easy now.
[00:01:42.526 --> 00:01:44.067]  This is a cautious belly.
[00:01:44.107 --> 00:01:45.589]  This is a declaration of war.
[00:01:46.029 --> 00:02:04.925]  And the fact that right after the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia, and the Russian response to that, that Poland, the Polish government, was pressured by the Bush administration to sign up with the missile defense thing after long, long months of negotiations and horse trading.
[00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:10.750]  That has put the world, as I put it, on a hair trigger for nuclear war by miscalculation.
[00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:19.540]  And we see more miscalculation with the preemptive attack with the U.S.-backed forces in Georgia against Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.643]  I mean, you've studied geopolitical plan for a long time.
[00:02:24.104 --> 00:02:30.049]  It seems like this is a more aggressive, virulent crop, or is it just so late in the game?
[00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.211]  I mean, obviously we know it's not just Bush.
[00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.713]  The big boys are backing all this.
[00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:36.495]  I mean, you get the question.
[00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:41.954]  This one in Georgia is extremely complex.
[00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:49.919]  I think the Cheney crowd, the people around Cheney in the military industrial complex and the intelligence community wanted
[00:02:50.968 --> 00:03:00.094]  This provocation in Georgia, they control the propaganda, so of course their CNN version of events is that Russia aggressively attacks this tiny little country, Georgia.
[00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:08.559]  And of course Americans love to champion the underdog, so American public opinion is swayed behind this big nasty bully, Russia.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.420]  But the reality was quite the opposite.
[00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:16.664]  Israel was up to their teeth in training and arming the Georgian armed forces.
[00:03:16.684 --> 00:03:18.946]  Yeah, Israel's hungry for some empire of its own!
[00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:42.112]  Well, there's some speculation that Israel was about building a military base, an air base in southern Georgia, which would put its missiles and its aircraft 500 kilometers closer to Tehran in Iran, the capital of Iran, and the various strategic sites in Iran, than it would by a strike from Tel Aviv or someplace in Israel.
[00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:52.431]  So, it's an extremely complex, this is what Churchill called the soft underbelly of Europe, this whole area, in the Caucasus and the Balkans.
[00:03:53.311 --> 00:04:09.516]  Okay, condensing this down, in your view, because I want to get into this full spectrum dominance and also some of the GMO, which I think is the greatest threat, and much more dangerous than even the nuclear threats and chemical, because it can't be put back in the bottle in some cases, potentially.
[00:04:12.377 --> 00:04:18.599]  Briefly, where do you see, now that the Georgian attack has been rebuffed, where do you see this going?
[00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.780]  We see 700-something million from the Euro, European Union going in, NATO, IMF.
[00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:29.981]  We see a billion coming from the U.S., more weapons being brought in.
[00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:33.702]  We see the leader of Georgia saying he may launch another attack.
[00:04:33.742 --> 00:04:34.622]  Where do you see this going?
[00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:42.767]  I don't think the leader of Georgia is going to launch another attack for a little while.
[00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:51.398]  He reports coming out from Georgian journalists and others inside Georgia at the time.
[00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.741]  When Russian jets flew over... No, he was cowering in the street crying.
[00:04:57.442 --> 00:04:58.322]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:04:58.702 --> 00:05:09.767]  There's a BBC video clip that's out on the internet where he's being interviewed around this time and he starts nervously taking his necktie and starts chewing and swallowing his necktie.
[00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:17.411]  Yeah, he's on national television looking like a cartoon caricature of a schizophrenic.
[00:05:18.072 --> 00:05:18.932]  Yeah.
[00:05:19.212 --> 00:05:30.216]  And I think he's known to be a highly unstable, pathological individual who's very vengeful in a Klan sort of way to any of his opponents.
[00:05:30.676 --> 00:05:37.198]  There are accusations from Georgian journalists that he actually was behind the murder of some of his political rivals.
[00:05:37.598 --> 00:05:42.900]  I can't prove that one way or the other, but all indications are he's a very nasty character.
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.140]  So where do you see this going?
[00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:49.861]  Well, I see that we're entering an extremely dangerous new phase.
[00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:54.665]  Now, what I would watch very closely is the events around Ukraine.
[00:05:56.006 --> 00:06:09.957]  If the Prime Minister Tymoshenko has pulled her party out of the government and the coalition with Yushchenko has collapsed, Yushchenko of the Orange Revolution, because she refused to condemn Russia for the events in Georgia.
[00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:23.713]  If that allows a government to be formed with the opposition party and leave Yushchenko out in the cold,
[00:06:24.568 --> 00:06:38.851]  Then you might have a whole new constellation where Ukraine would no longer be applying for NATO membership, and that would substantially change the balance of power in that whole Central Asia zone around Russia.
[00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:41.312]  All right, I'm going to skip this network break with our guests.
[00:06:41.332 --> 00:06:45.613]  You're going to hear here routinely, I'm really impressed with his research and information.
[00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:48.694]  It's just amazing information.
[00:06:48.714 --> 00:06:49.954]  We'll give you his websites as well.
[00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:56.056]  We're going to skip this break with William Engdahl right now on the InfoWars.com streams.
[00:06:57.956 --> 00:07:00.357]  Okay, I'm going ahead and skipping this break, sir.
[00:07:02.218 --> 00:07:04.798]  Let's finish up the next three minutes with Russia.
[00:07:08.504 --> 00:07:20.871]  Want to give people a prelude to the national security of the global national security state, your full spectrum dominance book, and then also the GMO, because we're definitely doing some of the same research.
[00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:22.112]  I want to get your take on that.
[00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:25.414]  I guess you are pressed for time.
[00:07:25.434 --> 00:07:26.995]  You can only do five minutes into the next hour?
[00:07:27.015 --> 00:07:29.556]  Yeah, that would be possible.
[00:07:29.676 --> 00:07:35.339]  Okay, well I'm going to have Trey, my producer, call you right when the interview ends to go ahead and set you up for two hours next week.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.880]  How does that sound?
[00:07:37.564 --> 00:07:41.390]  Okay, I'll just have to check my schedule and see when we can work that.
[00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.194]  And I assure you, you're not wasting your time.
[00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:48.040]  This show is worth a hundred other little Patriot shows, okay?
[00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:52.366]  Which are all very important programs, it's just that you're not wasting your time here coming on the show.
[00:07:53.109 --> 00:07:54.130]  No, I'm aware of that, Alex.
[00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.074]  Okay, well I don't know if you're aware of what we do here, but I'm certainly aware of your work.
[00:07:58.174 --> 00:08:00.436]  Okay, let's keep talking here.
[00:08:01.778 --> 00:08:12.328]  Finishing up with the Russia situation and where you see it going, because a lot of other experts and yourself and others have talked about the Russians did move some nukes into Ossetia, South Ossetia.
[00:08:12.348 --> 00:08:15.551]  They said if precision weapons are used, their general went on TV.
[00:08:16.272 --> 00:08:19.495]  And said, if you use precision weapons on us, we'll use nukes on you.
[00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:20.676]  Theater weapons.
[00:08:22.197 --> 00:08:23.838]  And I look at the body language.
[00:08:23.858 --> 00:08:25.800]  I mean, you're seeing reality.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.022]  This isn't the pompous, fake, western BS.
[00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:31.744]  And these aren't the fat, evil, you know, communists.
[00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:34.987]  I mean, you're looking at these guys and their generals actually look completely freaked out.
[00:08:38.256 --> 00:09:00.905]  Yeah, I think the crucial thing that's congealing around all of this is the look a little bit more east to something called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which up until about two years ago was kind of a shell organization that Russia and China set up seven or eight years ago to kind of
[00:09:04.451 --> 00:09:05.172]  We're good to go.
[00:09:22.723 --> 00:09:28.170]  That is cooperation across Eurasia with the exception of Western Europe but between Russia and China.
[00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:34.498]  Now the anti-communists are going to say this was all staged and that the China-Soviet split was staged.
[00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:36.080]  Your take on that?
[00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.757]  They have quite an interesting ideology, but it gets a little boring after a while.
[00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:53.668]  In terms of reality, China and Russia are very, very unlikely partners for a marriage.
[00:09:54.369 --> 00:09:55.110]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.211]  We're coming back to the full audience.
[00:09:56.232 --> 00:09:56.933]  Let's continue there.
[00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:12.421]  The Shanghai Cooperative Organization, and we're continuing with academic, author, researcher, William Engdahl, who's going to stay with us five minutes of the next segment, and then spend a couple hours with us next week.
[00:10:12.441 --> 00:10:13.501]  Very gracious to do that.
[00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:28.804]  Finishing up with what you see in the future, Russia and China teaming up for their New World Order, as they've said, against, quote, our New World Order, but our New World Order is a global corporate whorehouse where we fit the bill and the bankers basically urinate on us from on high.
[00:10:28.844 --> 00:10:29.504]  Please continue.
[00:10:32.811 --> 00:10:36.313]  That's quite a literary description of the reality.
[00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:37.914]  I have to laugh here.
[00:10:39.475 --> 00:10:40.635]  Good Texas poetry there.
[00:10:44.124 --> 00:10:54.849]  Well, I think the point I was making before the break was the Shanghai Cooperation Organization now is emerging as the worst nightmare of Washington.
[00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:09.614]  Their aggressive policies, the grab for Iraqi oil and the militarization of the Middle East after 2003 by the Bush-Cheney administration and the help of Tony Blair, the militarization of
[00:11:11.315 --> 00:11:12.256]  Eurasia through U.S.
[00:11:12.777 --> 00:11:25.328]  military bases, all across Afghanistan, into Pakistan, into Kyrgyzstan and elsewhere, and for a while in Uzbekistan.
[00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:36.318]  That has backfired, and Russia and China begin to realize that they have more in common than they do as opponents.
[00:11:37.006 --> 00:11:43.570]  And they have very carefully began to resolve border disputes going back to the 1960s between the two countries.
[00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:52.956]  Now, how does, throwing a wild card, how does Pakistan, what was really behind Benazir Bhutto, how does Musharraf resigning, how does all that feed in?
[00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:57.659]  I mean, is that the US Anglo-American system weakening more, or is that a reshuffling?
[00:12:00.021 --> 00:12:04.084]  I think that was in the Bhutto business, the assassination of Bhutto, I think
[00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:09.896]  The evidence points to the fact that Musharraf's own security services assassinated her.
[00:12:09.976 --> 00:12:15.523]  She was killed in a town where the Pakistani military virtually runs the town.
[00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:16.904]  That's what my sources are saying.
[00:12:17.164 --> 00:12:21.589]  And was it the West was sending her in and Musharraf said no thank you?
[00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.270]  Yeah, basically that.
[00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:25.091]  He saw her as a rival even.
[00:12:27.132 --> 00:12:31.753]  Cheney was running, by all accounts, the US-Pakistan policy.
[00:12:32.074 --> 00:12:36.195]  No one from the State Department was allowed any input into what they were playing with.
[00:12:36.735 --> 00:12:43.298]  And Cheney and his circle of hawks there in the office of the Vice President.
[00:12:44.778 --> 00:12:47.899]  Some say the President, but anyway, that's really beside the point.
[00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.933]  They needed to get a pleasant face on the events in Pakistan.
[00:12:55.013 --> 00:12:56.234]  So is Musharraf leaving?
[00:12:56.314 --> 00:12:57.655]  I mean, what's behind that?
[00:13:00.116 --> 00:13:06.581]  Well now, what's behind it is a real power vacuum inside Pakistan.
[00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:08.142]  With nuclear weapons floating around.
[00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:14.956]  Well, the reports I have are that the quid pro quo for Pakistan getting U.S.
[00:13:15.036 --> 00:13:18.179]  aid in the war on terror negotiations back in 2001.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.680]  Is that U.S.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.021]  forces sit on top of them?
[00:13:21.682 --> 00:13:21.882]  Yes.
[00:13:22.763 --> 00:13:23.283]  So the U.S.
[00:13:23.323 --> 00:13:24.784]  has the lock key on the Pakistan.
[00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:29.588]  So is Pakistan really just a sub-state or a proxy state if the U.S.
[00:13:29.648 --> 00:13:31.150]  or England ever wants to nuke India?
[00:13:34.099 --> 00:13:43.641]  Well, I think the Pentagon strategy in the last four years has been to make India the American cat's paw in Asia against China.
[00:13:44.601 --> 00:13:47.102]  And the Indian elites are split down the middle.
[00:13:47.462 --> 00:13:48.242]  They like U.S.
[00:13:48.282 --> 00:13:51.483]  investment in Chinese software companies and so forth.
[00:13:51.503 --> 00:13:53.023]  But Pakistan is the trump, though.
[00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.084]  I mean, that's a wild card, or do you disagree?
[00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:59.124]  Pakistan is a potential wild card.
[00:13:59.164 --> 00:14:01.925]  It's a very, very complex part of Asia.
[00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:04.829]  China has a big influence.
[00:14:04.849 --> 00:14:06.210]  I'm sorry you have to repeat the question.
[00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.914]  Why did the West, in your educated opinion, help arm Pakistan with nukes?
[00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:10.475]  What was the point of that?
[00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:31.447]  I think to justify the strategy of tension has been a very effective way for the U.S.
[00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:32.968]  to extend its territory.
[00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:33.448]  I agree with you.
[00:14:33.508 --> 00:14:33.929]  Stay there.
[00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:36.571]  So basically it's like in the West where he drops the gun in front of the guy.
[00:14:38.032 --> 00:14:39.753]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:14:39.773 --> 00:14:41.955]  Alright, I'm going to talk behind scenes with him right now.
[00:14:41.975 --> 00:14:43.697]  I'm going to keep rolling.
[00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.738]  Let me go back to William.
[00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:52.742]  William, we've got five minutes left, and I know I'm throwing a lot of you here at the end because I want to get your perspective on all this.
[00:14:52.762 --> 00:15:05.371]  Let's come back and just briefly talk about the national security state, your book, Full Spectrum Dominance, and then a little bit on the siege, on the GMO, so people get an idea of what's coming up next week.
[00:15:05.431 --> 00:15:07.472]  And then, do you happen to have your book in front of you?
[00:15:08.893 --> 00:15:09.294]  Which one?
[00:15:09.714 --> 00:15:12.436]  No, I mean your book on when you can come on next week.
[00:15:13.507 --> 00:15:14.028]  No, I don't.
[00:15:14.248 --> 00:15:15.830]  That's in my office.
[00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:20.414]  I'll have to check with that if your assistant can call me in about five minutes after we start.
[00:15:20.434 --> 00:15:20.634]  Perfect.
[00:15:20.675 --> 00:15:23.177]  We'll nail this down now because I really enjoy talking to you.
[00:15:23.477 --> 00:15:29.043]  When I get you on for two hours, I can really let you just run and then I won't have to interrupt so much with questions to get all my questions answered.
[00:15:29.824 --> 00:15:32.427]  Okay, we're going live, back live in 20 seconds, sir.
[00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:39.110]  To set it free, join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.331]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:43.312]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:45.053]  Bring down the new world order.
[00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:46.754]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:15:49.936 --> 00:15:51.838]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:55.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:15.383]  All right, we've got author, researcher, geopolitical expert, William Engdahl, on with his final segment.
[00:16:15.403 --> 00:16:20.267]  I'm going to twist his arm into two hours with us next week, because there's so many questions I want to ask.
[00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:23.069]  This guy's got really amazing research.
[00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:27.293]  Get ready for his website here at the end, and how you get some of his books, if any of you still read.
[00:16:27.333 --> 00:16:30.435]  I know I have, don't hardly have time, but this is stuff you've got to read.
[00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:32.036]  We're good to go.
[00:16:52.282 --> 00:16:59.929]  The full-spectrum dominance, and then also you get into the GMO and how dangerous it is, and then talk about that being conspiratorial.
[00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:01.630]  Break that down in the four minutes we've got left.
[00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:16.384]  Okay, well the full-spectrum dominance we've touched on many of the themes very briefly in the last hour, Alex, but that's basically the background to why the Cold War never ended and why
[00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:34.267]  Back in the late 1940s, the dominant factions in the American establishment at that point, which was most keynoted by one family, the Rockefeller family, Nelson, David, Lawrence, and John D. Rockefeller III,
[00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:38.641]  They developed this idea of the national security state.
[00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:40.282]  Anything could be justified.
[00:17:40.322 --> 00:17:48.486]  A violation of individual rights, any illegalities by the CIA and so forth, by the term national security.
[00:17:49.969 --> 00:17:55.912]  Nobody wants to be insecure, so they kind of without question accepted what was being done.
[00:17:56.212 --> 00:18:11.759]  But that has now become permanent and become globalized since the end of the Cold War, and that's what the full-spectrum dominance book takes up, and how that has been manipulated in terms of the American population and all sorts of other things, the control of the media.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.081]  Now, the question of GMO.
[00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:36.361]  I got into this, I've been following the whole agribusiness, the grain cartel and so forth since the early 1980s and the Orogui around trade talks of the GATT, and I realized that there was a cartel, there were certain core interests
[00:18:37.108 --> 00:18:42.230]  That are inviolable in terms of the U.S.
[00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.250]  National Security State.
[00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:45.791]  One of them is the military-industrial complex.
[00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:50.453]  Number two is the big oil, which includes Halliburton, most definitely.
[00:18:51.253 --> 00:18:56.515]  And number three is the grain cartel, or the control of world food trade.
[00:18:57.576 --> 00:19:00.517]  And Cargill, Bungie, Archadam, Midland.
[00:19:01.668 --> 00:19:17.104]  And what I got into in this GMO book was I realized that four, essentially four corporations, Monsanto, DuPont, Dow, and Syngenta, which is really a British company, but it's based in Basel, Switzerland,
[00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:27.002]  They stood to control patents on life, but patents on the most vital food in the human food chain.
[00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:35.625]  But they had to infect the entire biosphere to then create a global crisis that only global Anglo-American power could deal with.
[00:19:35.645 --> 00:19:37.706]  I haven't read your book, but I know their battle plan.
[00:19:37.726 --> 00:19:38.666]  Is that what your book gets into?
[00:19:39.688 --> 00:19:41.971]  It gets into the plan of eugenics.
[00:19:42.091 --> 00:19:50.101]  Using GMO is the Frankenstein dream of the Rockefeller eugenics faction.
[00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:58.430]  This is the truth, and I've got to get your book.
[00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.891]  I've got to carry it at InfoWars.com.
[00:20:00.911 --> 00:20:01.851]  People have got to get it.
[00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:04.712]  They understand this is part of a larger strategic plan.
[00:20:04.752 --> 00:20:05.832]  We have their own documents.
[00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:08.753]  I would guess you reverse-engineered and have the same stuff I have.
[00:20:09.233 --> 00:20:10.014]  I'm just so busy.
[00:20:10.074 --> 00:20:12.935]  I'm making a second endgame, or similar term.
[00:20:12.975 --> 00:20:13.975]  I'd like to interview you for it.
[00:20:14.335 --> 00:20:15.176]  I'm doing it next year.
[00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:17.396]  I may even suspend the JFK thing.
[00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:18.317]  This is just too important.
[00:20:18.657 --> 00:20:20.978]  But on this subject, give us your websites.
[00:20:21.018 --> 00:20:22.098]  Tell us how they get that book.
[00:20:22.845 --> 00:20:23.145]  Okay.
[00:20:24.146 --> 00:20:34.115]  www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net.
[00:20:34.636 --> 00:20:39.020]  www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net is my website.
[00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:45.206]  All the books are there in different languages so far that are available, but the
[00:20:46.093 --> 00:20:47.975]  Seeds of Destruction book is available.
[00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:50.919]  My publisher is Michelle Chossudovsky's Global Research.
[00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:56.365]  www.globalresearch.canada Okay, that's it.
[00:20:56.425 --> 00:20:56.925]  That's it, sir.
[00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:57.586]  We gotta let you go.
[00:21:00.066 --> 00:21:02.167]  We're behind the scenes now, but we are going out over the web.
[00:21:02.468 --> 00:21:05.469]  I'm going to have Trey call you right now, and let's do a two-hour show.
[00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:21.499]  One on full-spectrum dominance, and then we'll focus in on one tool in full-spectrum dominance, total control of the life, your global biosphere, through genetic engineering and their kangaroo courts, and the eugenics program, the forced inoculations through the food.
[00:21:21.519 --> 00:21:27.222]  I mean, because if you've done the research, you've got the same info, but I want to get your scholarly perspective.
[00:21:27.282 --> 00:21:29.124]  Okay, and if you could give me
[00:21:30.144 --> 00:21:34.866]  One or two minutes, not more, to get to my office down the hall here.
[00:21:35.126 --> 00:21:38.227]  I'll get on my Outlook calendar and see what I've got.
[00:21:38.427 --> 00:21:39.488]  Okay, you are the best.
[00:21:39.528 --> 00:21:40.688]  We'll talk to you next week, sir.
[00:21:41.108 --> 00:21:41.328]  Great.
[00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:42.309]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[00:21:42.349 --> 00:21:42.749]  Thank you.
[00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:42.829]  Wow.
[00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.732]  Interviews like that, folks, just completely blow you away.
[00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:49.075]  Will somebody go tell Trey to call him in two minutes?
[00:21:49.555 --> 00:21:52.258]  He's expecting the call two hours next week.
[00:21:52.798 --> 00:21:53.579]  Two hours with him.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:07.392]  You know, when you've got all the documents and everything, and you know they're killing you, you know they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines, you know that the diabetes is from the vaccines, and that it's in all the medical journals, British Medical, American Medical.
[00:22:08.092 --> 00:22:12.453]  Uh, you know, when you know that they're doing it, and you know they're not going to stop it, it's like, God!
[00:22:12.754 --> 00:22:19.736]  And you've got these stupid people like Michelle Malkin, scared of Muslims that are going to get her, which are run by the CIA, the radical Muslims, publicly.
[00:22:20.316 --> 00:22:24.917]  And she's saying, give up your rights, go to FEMA camps or the Muslims will get you, meanwhile they're poisoning everybody.
[00:22:24.937 --> 00:22:33.420]  You've got these sicko Rockefeller Queen of England people who frickin' want to kill all of us, and it's a fact, and you just can't get the general public to wake up to it!
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.801]  I'm going to come back on the main show and talk about that.
[00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:40.122]  Let's go back to the radio ads.
[00:22:40.202 --> 00:22:40.982]  I'm going to take a break.
[00:22:45.123 --> 00:22:46.664]  John, you can go ahead and feed the audio back.
[00:22:46.684 --> 00:22:48.984]  Hey everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[00:23:00.546 --> 00:23:15.512]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna, I love beef stroganoff, I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts, all kinds of entrees and soups and desserts and breakfasts.
[00:23:15.932 --> 00:23:16.752]  I love that stuff.
[00:23:17.012 --> 00:23:20.454]  Now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[00:23:20.674 --> 00:23:23.995]  I mean the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[00:23:24.215 --> 00:23:26.116]  Grocery prices are right on their heels.
[00:23:26.456 --> 00:23:27.976]  How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[00:23:28.096 --> 00:23:29.217]  Well I found a way to buy
[00:23:29.677 --> 00:23:34.659]  Really incredible foods like I just described at half the price of last year's grocery bill.
[00:23:34.879 --> 00:23:40.160]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year, I can have it delivered to your door!
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.461]  Let me tell you how.
[00:23:41.721 --> 00:23:44.221]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com right now.
[00:23:44.682 --> 00:23:49.123]  eFoodsDirect.com or call toll free number 800-409-5633 800-409-5633.
[00:23:49.183 --> 00:23:50.223]  Cut those food costs now.
[00:23:57.325 --> 00:24:02.948]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:04.249 --> 00:24:14.234]  Last week in Denver, three separate times for a total of about two and a half hours, we took over MSNBC's live outdoor feeds with Infowars.com, 9-11's an inside job.
[00:24:14.254 --> 00:24:24.799]  Now, I haven't had time to defend myself on this, but all my detractors said, how come you just repeated 9-11's an inside job and investigate 9-11 over and over again?
[00:24:25.782 --> 00:24:28.244]  Well, if you want to know why, it's in MSNBC right now.
[00:24:28.325 --> 00:24:29.406]  They're giving speeches.
[00:24:29.426 --> 00:24:33.389]  9-11 Truths, giving speeches, and I'm not knocking them, they're great folks.
[00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.411]  They just called us to let us know they're doing it.
[00:24:36.192 --> 00:24:37.033]  And you can't hear it.
[00:24:37.313 --> 00:24:46.102]  When you go up there and say, Dick Cheney planned an attack on our own ships, you know, the Gulf of Tonkin was staged, we need to look into 9-11.
[00:24:46.302 --> 00:24:48.844]  You don't hear that because they're talking over you.
[00:24:49.585 --> 00:24:57.148]  But if you say 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job, 9-11's an inside job, people can listen.
[00:24:57.688 --> 00:25:04.510]  And I've talked to family, people all over the country, who would be flipping through and would hear it go, and then they would focus to see what was being said.
[00:25:07.284 --> 00:25:10.187]  So it's very, very... Again, I've been doing this a while, folks.
[00:25:10.207 --> 00:25:11.468]  This isn't my first rodeo.
[00:25:12.188 --> 00:25:15.371]  And I don't claim that everybody's got to go copy what I do.
[00:25:16.012 --> 00:25:18.915]  But if you watch the other people bullhorning, because I would take a break.
[00:25:19.115 --> 00:25:20.976]  I'd go for like 20 minutes and then stop for five.
[00:25:21.337 --> 00:25:24.500]  We'd hand the bullhorn to somebody, and when I'm talking, you hear every word of it.
[00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.381]  9-11's an inside job.
[00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:27.522]  Investigate 9-11.
[00:25:27.622 --> 00:25:29.283]  Google inside job.
[00:25:29.303 --> 00:25:33.186]  You know, I would say each one about 10 times to make sure people could go, what is he saying?
[00:25:33.567 --> 00:25:35.388]  And then listen and then write it down.
[00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:37.530]  It was to get a message over, not just to have...
[00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:47.541]  So, they're culture jamming out there.
[00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:49.042]  By the way, you've got Nick's cell phone.
[00:25:49.242 --> 00:25:50.303]  They're out there on site.
[00:25:50.664 --> 00:25:54.187]  We can actually direct them from here, Traycan, on where to put their signs.
[00:25:54.207 --> 00:25:56.789]  They keep cutting away with the cameras so that people can't see.
[00:25:56.849 --> 00:25:58.110]  Investigate 9-11.
[00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.812]  Expose the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:02.674]  I don't know where MSNBC is in St.
[00:26:02.694 --> 00:26:04.335]  Paul, but I want to find that address.
[00:26:04.736 --> 00:26:06.978]  They're going to be live out there for the next four hours.
[00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:07.838]  Get out there!
[00:26:08.219 --> 00:26:09.720]  Take it over again!
[00:26:10.301 --> 00:26:10.861]  Yes!
[00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:11.982]  I love it!
[00:26:12.082 --> 00:26:12.803]  And please,
[00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:16.249]  Here's an example.
[00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:17.850]  Luke's a smart guy, great guy.
[00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.471]  But Luke's saying, we are changed, we are changed.
[00:26:20.511 --> 00:26:23.232]  And sure enough, people thought that it was a Barack Obama group.
[00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:24.953]  And I said, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:24.993 --> 00:26:27.935]  I said, add .org to the end of that.
[00:26:27.975 --> 00:26:43.542]  And so it's not me telling you what to do, I just am telling you from my perspective, when you go give speeches, complex speeches on a bullhorn, anything past, hey, hey, ho, ho, the New World Order's got to go,
[00:26:45.063 --> 00:26:57.807]  He gets lost, because you've got Kay Bailey Hutchinson again, we've already taken over once when she was on there, and the talking heads, and they're both blabbering, and they're turning their mics up, and they're trying to talk right into their mics, and they're trying to show that we can't get our message across.
[00:26:58.387 --> 00:26:59.747]  One thing gets across.
[00:27:00.447 --> 00:27:02.828]  That's repetitive statements.
[00:27:04.884 --> 00:27:22.327]  Now, if MSNBC just stood down, turned their mics off, or stopped talking themselves and put a mic in front of the crowd, then I would say, ladies and gentlemen, governments throughout history have staged events, staged terror attacks, provocations, to mobilize their population behind empire.
[00:27:22.827 --> 00:27:33.369]  In other cases, governments stage horrible crimes or terror attacks to blame it on domestic minorities they wish to oppress or dominate or blame problems in the economy on.
[00:27:34.522 --> 00:27:44.323]  Please visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or watch for free right now on Google Video, Terror Storm, Truth Rising and other films.
[00:27:45.655 --> 00:28:04.952]  Again, free, any of you that have a computer, TerrorStorm, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, then I would be able to, but no, if I've got three or four or five talking heads talking over me, I'm trying to talk over them, what is the one thing that will cut across it and make people pay attention?
[00:28:05.252 --> 00:28:06.573]  What's that guy repeating?
[00:28:06.853 --> 00:28:10.837]  Hold on, and then you can't, we tried it here, you can't help
[00:28:11.849 --> 00:28:13.370]  But listen to what's being repeated.
[00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.251]  Then you tune out what they're saying and you hear it all.
[00:28:16.972 --> 00:28:18.232]  Oh, investigate 9-11.
[00:28:18.272 --> 00:28:19.173]  I'd say that ten times.
[00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:22.554]  And I'd say, Google inside job.
[00:28:22.915 --> 00:28:25.056]  Google inside job!
[00:28:25.456 --> 00:28:27.797]  Google inside job!
[00:28:27.817 --> 00:28:36.141]  I would say it's slow, too, so that it wouldn't get caught with him talking over it, where you could hear the total of what was happening.
[00:28:36.321 --> 00:28:37.362]  Can somebody call Nick?
[00:28:38.424 --> 00:28:39.305]  We already had him on today.
[00:28:39.325 --> 00:28:47.153]  I mean, if you guys have the number, listen, I am it to John Harmon at the network, because what's going to happen is that we're going to just bumble around here.
[00:28:47.874 --> 00:28:50.897]  I am, how dare you Aaron, not work hard enough, you're now into hour 30.
[00:28:52.714 --> 00:28:53.214]  I'm joking.
[00:28:53.254 --> 00:28:55.275]  I said, how dare you not work harder in the hour thirty.
[00:28:55.856 --> 00:29:04.380]  Just, just IM John Harmon, Nick's number, instead of them Nick bumbling around or whatever, because he's in the middle of a protest, we can't blame him, I bumble around.
[00:29:05.021 --> 00:29:08.602]  Get him to give that information right now to John Harmon.
[00:29:08.622 --> 00:29:11.324]  It's been going on for ten minutes.
[00:29:11.724 --> 00:29:16.707]  The point is, is that I want to get the guys that are out there bullhorning live right now.
[00:29:16.727 --> 00:29:20.088]  Instead of this going on any further, John, just call
[00:29:21.701 --> 00:29:22.782]  Just call it Nick right now.
[00:29:23.202 --> 00:29:24.403]  Oh, you're calling Nick right now?
[00:29:24.443 --> 00:29:25.404]  Good, good, good.
[00:29:25.705 --> 00:29:29.768]  I get all in the fever of the fog of info war and get kind of crazed here, sorry.
[00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:34.592]  Anyway, should I get up there and say, look at the PMAG documents!
[00:29:34.632 --> 00:29:37.595]  Dick Cheney said they needed a pretext, a new Pearl Harbor!
[00:29:37.635 --> 00:29:40.858]  You're not going to understand that over five talking heads talking over you.
[00:29:40.898 --> 00:29:48.344]  But, if you say, 9-11 was an inside job!
[00:29:49.326 --> 00:29:56.409]  9-11 was an inside job, and say it eight more times, or Google inside job!
[00:29:57.329 --> 00:29:59.690]  Google inside job!
[00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:05.072]  Or, say ten or fifteen times, Investigate 9-11!
[00:30:05.752 --> 00:30:07.593]  Investigate 9-11!
[00:30:08.553 --> 00:30:10.494]  I'm telling you how to culture jam these guys.
[00:30:10.514 --> 00:30:12.334]  I mean, because I've been to these live events.
[00:30:12.354 --> 00:30:15.295]  You give a speech, I learn by trial and error.
[00:30:16.336 --> 00:30:16.656]  You go,
[00:30:18.823 --> 00:30:19.744]  Give one of these events.
[00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.266]  You go have one of these events.
[00:30:23.729 --> 00:30:25.351]  And that's what's happening right now.
[00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:31.017]  You don't give simple, direct, inside job, inside job, inside job.
[00:30:31.558 --> 00:30:33.721]  All you're doing is screwing up the broadcast and it's pointless.
[00:30:34.619 --> 00:30:40.204]  There is no point in screwing up their transmission unless it is to say, stop the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:30:40.304 --> 00:30:41.585]  Stop the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:30:42.086 --> 00:30:42.846]  Let's go to Nick.
[00:30:42.906 --> 00:30:45.749]  We are Change up there in Minnesota, in St.
[00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:46.089]  Paul.
[00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.251]  Where are you right now specifically?
[00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:51.895]  Where is MSNBC so we can get some more Patriots out there?
[00:30:52.695 --> 00:30:58.300]  Yeah, we are live at Landmark Plaza and Wright Park in St.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:58.681]  Paul.
[00:30:59.141 --> 00:31:01.123]  MSNBC is broadcasting live outside.
[00:31:01.713 --> 00:31:05.835]  Interesting enough, our State Senator Amy Klobuchar just shot on tape.
[00:31:06.515 --> 00:31:07.456]  Say it, listen, listen.
[00:31:07.556 --> 00:31:08.536]  Three times, Nick.
[00:31:08.616 --> 00:31:11.098]  Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.
[00:31:11.218 --> 00:31:11.478]  Nick.
[00:31:12.138 --> 00:31:12.418]  Nick.
[00:31:18.021 --> 00:31:18.861]  That's a good chant.
[00:31:22.963 --> 00:31:24.324]  Nick, repeat where you are.
[00:31:24.384 --> 00:31:26.085]  The park, where you are again.
[00:31:26.869 --> 00:31:34.873]  Rice Park, uh, the corner of 5th Street and Washington in the state office.
[00:31:36.573 --> 00:31:38.494]  Okay, plug that again for people that may not have heard it.
[00:31:39.275 --> 00:31:41.936]  Alright, 5th Street and Washington.
[00:31:42.436 --> 00:31:44.077]  5th Street and Washington where?
[00:31:45.109 --> 00:31:45.569]  In St.
[00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.890]  Paul.
[00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.411]  Fifth Street and Washington in St.
[00:31:48.451 --> 00:31:48.831]  Paul.
[00:31:48.952 --> 00:31:49.852]  No excuses.
[00:31:49.912 --> 00:31:50.733]  Go to Google.
[00:31:51.253 --> 00:31:52.013]  Get down there now.
[00:31:52.033 --> 00:31:53.614]  They're going to be broadcasting for hours now.
[00:31:53.655 --> 00:31:58.698]  I'm not going to tell you guys what to do, but we're watching it on TV, and most of those chants aren't getting out.
[00:31:58.758 --> 00:32:00.079]  You say there's a bullhorn there?
[00:32:01.339 --> 00:32:03.701]  Ah, they told us if we use the bullhorn, we're kicked out.
[00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:05.562]  We've already been warned about that.
[00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:06.122]  Kicked out?
[00:32:06.162 --> 00:32:06.823]  Who told you that?
[00:32:06.843 --> 00:32:08.084]  Ah, the police.
[00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.888]  Okay, so they're not like Denver, they're trying to violate you.
[00:32:11.908 --> 00:32:28.179]  Okay, if you all together cup your hands over your mouth and chant, 9-11 was an inside job, ten times in a row, and then say investigate, and the reason, it sounds mindless, but then it'll get across TV and people will go, what are they saying?
[00:32:28.519 --> 00:32:35.504]  It's the repetition, and you've got to catapult the propaganda like Bush said, and then people will actually tune into that chant.
[00:32:35.604 --> 00:32:36.585]  They will ignore
[00:32:37.085 --> 00:32:39.087]  What I'm hearing on TV is just a bunch of noise.
[00:32:39.127 --> 00:32:41.068]  The signs look great, so I commend all of you.
[00:32:41.368 --> 00:32:41.989]  You got guts.
[00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.589]  Guts is enough.
[00:32:42.609 --> 00:32:43.370]  You're taking action.
[00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:43.931]  I salute you.
[00:32:43.951 --> 00:32:44.491]  You're the best.
[00:32:45.031 --> 00:32:47.193]  But, I mean, can we get some inside job chants going here?
[00:32:48.194 --> 00:32:49.715]  Yeah, I'll work on that right now.
[00:32:49.735 --> 00:32:52.658]  Stay with me here.
[00:32:52.818 --> 00:32:54.659]  Alright.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:59.043]  Alex Jones and the whole show is tuning in right now.
[00:32:59.063 --> 00:32:59.723]  We're on the phone.
[00:33:03.178 --> 00:33:05.200]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.321]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:33:06.341 --> 00:33:07.762]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:33:23.407 --> 00:33:27.830]  Alright.
[00:33:28.531 --> 00:33:29.811]  So you're watching us live, Alex?
[00:33:29.911 --> 00:33:32.873]  Yeah, well I was watching you live out in the... Are they live right now?
[00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:34.294]  Let's keep giving the guys reports.
[00:33:37.096 --> 00:33:38.077]  They're live right now, right?
[00:33:39.377 --> 00:33:39.557]  Yes.
[00:33:40.358 --> 00:33:41.539]  They are live right now, guys?
[00:33:42.489 --> 00:33:46.071]  My new studio's actually got a live cable in and I never allowed one before.
[00:33:46.091 --> 00:33:47.171]  Yeah, they're live!
[00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:47.671]  Do it again!
[00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:50.793]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:33:50.893 --> 00:33:52.353]  Do your job!
[00:33:52.493 --> 00:33:53.414]  Do your job!
[00:33:53.794 --> 00:33:55.075]  Do your job!
[00:33:55.355 --> 00:33:56.715]  Do your job!
[00:33:56.975 --> 00:33:58.296]  Do your job!
[00:33:58.516 --> 00:33:58.936]  Do your job!
[00:33:58.976 --> 00:34:01.697]  Yeah, yeah, do your job's not a good one because they won't understand that.
[00:34:01.717 --> 00:34:03.298]  Do your job!
[00:34:03.358 --> 00:34:04.679]  Do your job!
[00:34:04.699 --> 00:34:06.940]  Do your job!
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.540]  Do your job!
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.461]  That do your job one really drives me up the wall.
[00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:21.541]  Please have him say, Google inside job, Google inside job, Google inside job.
[00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:24.763]  Google inside job!
[00:34:24.803 --> 00:34:26.063]  Google inside job!
[00:34:26.363 --> 00:34:28.624]  Google inside job!
[00:34:28.664 --> 00:34:30.585]  Google inside job!
[00:34:30.645 --> 00:34:34.446]  Google inside job!
[00:34:34.466 --> 00:34:36.007]  Google inside job!
[00:34:36.367 --> 00:34:37.908]  Google inside job!
[00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:43.852]  I'm on the phone.
[00:34:44.492 --> 00:34:48.594]  I can't talk to you right now.
[00:34:49.094 --> 00:34:50.635]  Now you can talk to the media if you need to.
[00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:51.816]  You're doing a great job, Nick.
[00:34:52.236 --> 00:34:53.577]  Tell us how long you've been out there.
[00:34:55.058 --> 00:35:01.261]  Well, we were with the Kevin Barrett and Tim Fletcher march at the Capitol, and we marched down here to Rex Park.
[00:35:01.621 --> 00:35:03.022]  There's a group of probably
[00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:05.952]  Oh, 30 to 50 of us, I'm not sure.
[00:35:05.992 --> 00:35:06.492]  Yep, yep.
[00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:29.551]  So you do have the rat bastards trying to stop your First Amendment.
[00:35:29.912 --> 00:35:32.693]  We need more people to get down there right now.
[00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:35.635]  I'm going to skip this break for Infowars.com stream listeners.
[00:35:36.115 --> 00:35:43.459]  With Nick, Minnesota Change up there, Ohio, Iowa Change, Wisconsin Change, all those great men and women out there.
[00:35:43.499 --> 00:35:45.140]  They need your help right now.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.701]  This will be going for three more hours.
[00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:47.782]  Get in your car.
[00:35:47.822 --> 00:35:49.323]  I don't care if you're in Wisconsin.
[00:35:49.603 --> 00:35:54.666]  Get your butt down there to that park right now and you scream as loud as you can.
[00:35:55.146 --> 00:35:57.070]  We'll form a physical bullhorn.
[00:35:57.511 --> 00:35:58.653]  Let me talk to him.
[00:35:59.515 --> 00:35:59.935]  Hey, Nick?
[00:36:02.276 --> 00:36:02.676]  Still with you.
[00:36:03.037 --> 00:36:04.518]  Nick, Nick, we need more.
[00:36:04.758 --> 00:36:15.026]  I need you guys to stay down there for hours, and you'll get more people to physically... I mean, if you had 50 more, you'll be louder than a bullhorn as long as everybody cuts their hands.
[00:36:15.686 --> 00:36:28.556]  If people cut their hands and aim it at them, and scream 9-11's and Inside Job ten times in a row, Google Inside Job, Infowars.com, WeAreChange.org, you will effectively take over the enemy operation.
[00:36:29.912 --> 00:36:30.853]  Yeah, it's pretty interesting.
[00:36:30.893 --> 00:36:35.756]  Right now what they do is every other break they're switching sides with the side that they're on.
[00:36:35.776 --> 00:36:38.497]  So we've got to constantly keep moving back and forth around the stage.
[00:36:38.678 --> 00:36:40.138]  Yeah, you're defeating the enemy, don't worry.
[00:36:40.799 --> 00:36:41.900]  Yep, yep.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.043]  There was something I was going to add.
[00:36:47.783 --> 00:36:49.905]  Yeah, just people listening in, get down here.
[00:36:51.486 --> 00:36:53.927]  We need your support, we need your voices.
[00:36:54.027 --> 00:36:56.549]  Alright, give folks the address again.
[00:36:58.015 --> 00:37:02.096]  It is Washington and 5th Street.
[00:37:02.136 --> 00:37:02.476]  In St.
[00:37:02.496 --> 00:37:02.836]  Paul.
[00:37:03.476 --> 00:37:04.137]  At Wrights Park.
[00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:05.457]  At Wrights Park?
[00:37:06.877 --> 00:37:07.677]  Yes.
[00:37:07.737 --> 00:37:08.958]  Wrights, like the Wright Brothers?
[00:37:09.718 --> 00:37:11.158]  Wrights, like the food.
[00:37:11.718 --> 00:37:16.159]  Rice, rice, as in Chinese food.
[00:37:16.539 --> 00:37:18.420]  Wrights Park at Washington and what?
[00:37:20.587 --> 00:37:21.347]  Washington 5th.
[00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:22.427]  Okay, I've got that right.
[00:37:22.988 --> 00:37:24.048]  Well, good job.
[00:37:24.068 --> 00:37:25.508]  I guess they're not live right now?
[00:37:25.528 --> 00:37:30.009]  Uh, they just went to commercial and they're switching sides of the stage.
[00:37:31.269 --> 00:37:33.029]  Okay, you guys move around, hit them hard.
[00:37:33.049 --> 00:37:34.510]  We'll check in with you at the end of the show.
[00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:35.450]  Good job, Nick.
[00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.070]  Yep, thanks Alex.
[00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:37.950]  Thank you.
[00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:42.971]  Yeah, folks, if the Orwellian stuff can't get any worse, I'm completely blown away right now.
[00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:48.112]  I mean, these are the type of news stories I haven't even gotten to yet today.
[00:37:50.174 --> 00:37:52.795]  Israeli Mossad let Nazi Mengele get away.
[00:37:52.815 --> 00:37:56.196]  We're going to cover that coming up when we come out of break.
[00:37:56.216 --> 00:37:59.517]  And also, sudden death after arrest may be new syndrome.
[00:38:00.897 --> 00:38:09.479]  When they jump on your head and break your neck, or when they taser you and you die, they have got quack doctors to say, oh, there's a new syndrome.
[00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:13.880]  When you're tasered, it's not the taser, it's a new syndrome.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.581]  They're scared and they're dying.
[00:38:18.078 --> 00:38:23.186]  Now, remember that they claim a new syndrome made Tower 1, 2, and 7 full.
[00:38:23.907 --> 00:38:30.938]  First it was fire and fuel oil and bad building, and then they said, no, it was thermal expansion, a new syndrome.
[00:38:31.658 --> 00:38:41.461]  So, soon, if a cop walks up and shoots you five times in the head, blows your brain completely out, you've just got skin flapping, they'll say, oh, he died of a syndrome.
[00:38:43.741 --> 00:38:47.162]  Oh, we're going to electro-shock you repeatedly, over and over again.
[00:38:47.442 --> 00:38:50.663]  We'll throw you off a bridge, and if you die, it's a new syndrome.
[00:38:58.604 --> 00:39:05.047]  Oh my God, it says there's been 60 plus deaths in one city of Spain alone, and the police say it's a new syndrome.
[00:39:05.707 --> 00:39:08.568]  It's a syndrome dying in the jails, and the public will believe it.
[00:39:08.928 --> 00:39:09.969]  Oh, it's a syndrome!
[00:39:10.509 --> 00:39:12.830]  When you're tasered and die, it's a syndrome!
[00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:14.651]  Did I tell you, Paul?
[00:39:15.311 --> 00:39:17.152]  Paul, come on in here, I want you live on air right now.
[00:39:19.192 --> 00:39:24.895]  Let's bring Paul Hartman in here today for his debut on air with us, doing a lot of our IT work here, doing a great job.
[00:39:26.343 --> 00:39:27.664]  No, thanks for letting me know, man.
[00:39:48.487 --> 00:39:51.871]  Absolutely, but we need to, we need to, oh, go punch it up.
[00:39:52.572 --> 00:39:56.976]  The problem is when you have your camera controller out of the room, in studio, then you can't be switching cameras.
[00:39:56.997 --> 00:39:59.419]  I want you to see, see Paul Hartman.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.461]  Okay, bring me back in live.
[00:40:03.203 --> 00:40:05.466]  No matter how hard you try!
[00:40:07.068 --> 00:40:08.749]  You can't stop us now!
[00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:09.811]  Alright, let's do this.
[00:40:19.548 --> 00:40:21.029]  Since the prehistoric ages!
[00:40:21.129 --> 00:40:30.855]  Alright, this is how dumb the establishment thinks we are.
[00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:55.547]  They grabbed that woman in one airport, had her handcuffed behind her back, killed her in the jail cell, and then claimed she hung herself with her handcuff, which is impossible.
[00:40:55.587 --> 00:40:56.387]  Turned out they killed her.
[00:40:57.387 --> 00:41:00.549]  The Polish guy's been locked in there for 30-something hours in Canada.
[00:41:00.909 --> 00:41:09.693]  He throws a fit, throws a trash can over, they come and taser him a bunch, jump on his head with his knees, break his neck, and they said, look, his broken neck and the tasers didn't kill him.
[00:41:10.153 --> 00:41:11.374]  It's a new syndrome.
[00:41:12.134 --> 00:41:31.236]  and uh... within thousands of deaths now after being shocked with different stun gun systems and they now say no no no no no no uh... actually it's a new syndrome and i'm not kidding then the police came out and said actually tasers are good for your heart and taser hired a doctor to say that tasers are actually good for your heart but the new thing is with sixty plus deaths
[00:41:32.745 --> 00:41:36.307]  Following police detention, this is where they beat you to death in the jail cell.
[00:41:36.648 --> 00:41:38.009]  It's a new syndrome.
[00:41:38.049 --> 00:41:39.129]  They're not murdering you.
[00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:40.690]  You're not dying en masse.
[00:41:40.951 --> 00:41:42.692]  You're not, don't tase me bro, you know?
[00:41:43.012 --> 00:41:46.354]  And pretty soon they'll tase you and say it doesn't exist, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:46.674 --> 00:41:50.157]  They think you're so dumb, they'll tell you Russia attacked Georgia when they didn't.
[00:41:51.017 --> 00:41:53.338]  They'll tell you that they're WMDs in Iraq.
[00:41:53.358 --> 00:41:54.618]  They'll tell you Aspartame is good.
[00:41:54.958 --> 00:41:57.519]  I wanted to bring in one of our new IT guys doing a great job.
[00:41:57.539 --> 00:42:04.521]  By the way, I'm about to put out a public announcement for people to send in resumes who want to be IT around here.
[00:42:04.541 --> 00:42:07.902]  So you can send those to Mike at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:08.603 --> 00:42:14.825]  But Hartman, if you go out and the cop beats you to death, it's not the cop beating you with a belly club or the taser.
[00:42:15.185 --> 00:42:16.205]  It's a new syndrome, Paul.
[00:42:16.465 --> 00:42:24.469]  It's kind of like that guy that got hog-tied and duct-taped around his whole head, and then committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
[00:42:24.869 --> 00:42:30.612]  That's right, and I forgot the Islamic Center locally, his imam did call me last week before I left, and I forgot to call him back.
[00:42:30.652 --> 00:42:31.412]  I'll call him today.
[00:42:31.432 --> 00:42:32.873]  And yeah, they gave him to him.
[00:42:32.893 --> 00:42:40.477]  He'd been tortured all over, sliced up, and the police said, no, no, no, you tie yourself and slice yourself open and throw yourself in the lake.
[00:42:40.497 --> 00:42:41.037]  It's quite normal.
[00:42:41.457 --> 00:42:43.058]  It was crazy, man.
[00:42:44.839 --> 00:42:46.059]  Nobody really cared about it.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.600]  Well, you know, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:49.801]  There's no government corruption.
[00:42:49.821 --> 00:42:50.621]  The government's perfect.
[00:42:50.962 --> 00:42:51.622]  Everything's fine.
[00:42:51.662 --> 00:42:53.263]  And if you don't agree with that, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:53.683 --> 00:42:54.923]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:42:54.963 --> 00:42:57.705]  Young men who die suddenly after being arrested by the police.
[00:42:58.485 --> 00:43:00.886]  Oh, maybe victims of a new syndrome.
[00:43:03.267 --> 00:43:07.490]  And again, it's a new syndrome that made Building 7 fall, never before seen, called Thermal Expansion.
[00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.293]  Similar to one that kills wild animals when they are captured, Spanish researchers said on Tuesday.
[00:43:12.693 --> 00:43:16.596]  So yeah, a rabbit may die, they've already said this in the U.S.
[00:43:16.936 --> 00:43:19.117]  A rabbit might, but no, we're not pigeons or rabbits.
[00:43:19.678 --> 00:43:25.842]  And no, humans have never done this unless they were elderly, but now young men and young women die after being taser-beaten.
[00:43:25.902 --> 00:43:28.103]  Mikhail Martinez sells at Madrid's hospital.
[00:43:30.672 --> 00:43:36.496]  Reached the conclusion after investigating 60 cases of sudden unexplained deaths in Spain following police detention.
[00:43:36.796 --> 00:43:39.918]  Kind of like they sort of give them babies, vaccines, they sort of die of convulsions.
[00:43:40.619 --> 00:43:42.560]  They don't just, they say you shook them.
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.642]  And then they jail you for the vaccine killing your baby.
[00:43:46.242 --> 00:43:48.644]  In one third of the cases death occurred at the point of arrest.
[00:43:48.984 --> 00:43:51.306]  Oh, while in the remainder death was in the 24 hours.
[00:43:51.806 --> 00:43:54.168]  In the jail cell though, nothing happened behind the scenes.
[00:43:54.668 --> 00:43:55.949]  Because he's believing the police.
[00:43:55.969 --> 00:43:57.230]  So he's saying, yeah, there's a new phenomenon.
[00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.511]  You die when they get you.
[00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:00.372]  60 of them in one city.
[00:44:01.353 --> 00:44:05.555]  It's just crazy to me how people just want to hide under the blankets.
[00:44:05.575 --> 00:44:08.537]  I don't understand why folks just don't want to see the truth come out of the darkness.
[00:44:31.112 --> 00:44:34.474]  I was always good at that game Connect the Dots when I was a little kid.
[00:44:34.614 --> 00:44:36.355]  No, that's Al-Qaeda the Dots.
[00:44:38.496 --> 00:44:48.161]  It says, just why they died remains a mystery, but he believes young men in particular, young men in particular who are smart off, may experience surges of blood levels in chemicals known as
[00:44:50.543 --> 00:44:53.104]  Catch a chemicalides when under severe stress.
[00:44:53.164 --> 00:44:54.765]  Adrenaline is one of the most abundant.
[00:44:55.345 --> 00:44:55.906]  And it goes on.
[00:44:55.946 --> 00:44:59.687]  We know that when a wild animal is captured, sometimes the animal dies suddenly, he said.
[00:45:00.148 --> 00:45:01.228]  I've never heard of that before.
[00:45:01.348 --> 00:45:03.369]  Well, it actually does happen in prey species.
[00:45:03.389 --> 00:45:05.190]  They're kind of designed to shut off and be eaten.
[00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.431]  Lions, tigers.
[00:45:07.451 --> 00:45:09.612]  Well, how come they don't die in the zoo, then?
[00:45:10.012 --> 00:45:10.933]  Apes don't do this.
[00:45:10.953 --> 00:45:12.794]  I mean, we're super predators.
[00:45:12.994 --> 00:45:15.595]  I'm not saying we're apes, but generally related to that.
[00:45:15.895 --> 00:45:17.696]  The point is, is that no, no, no, we don't.
[00:45:17.956 --> 00:45:19.397]  We don't do that, unless we're old.
[00:45:20.198 --> 00:45:21.587]  Okay, cardiac arrest.
[00:45:21.627 --> 00:45:22.090]  No, no, these are...
[00:45:26.365 --> 00:45:33.428]  So Sellers compiled a study, the first of its kind in any country, by scouring Spanish newspapers for cases of unexplained death under police detention.
[00:45:33.748 --> 00:45:34.949]  Yeah, the cops aren't killing him.
[00:45:35.289 --> 00:45:37.089]  Kind of like that guy's neck they broke up in Canada.
[00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:38.330]  Well, the broken neck didn't kill him.
[00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.010]  You didn't know that?
[00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.791]  He just had some... He was 32 years old.
[00:45:41.831 --> 00:45:42.672]  He had a heart attack.
[00:45:42.732 --> 00:45:43.852]  He's just mentally ill.
[00:45:43.892 --> 00:45:44.693]  He's got a problem.
[00:45:44.713 --> 00:45:46.253]  It's the right age for a heart attack.
[00:45:46.293 --> 00:45:46.793]  Yeah, you know.
[00:45:47.434 --> 00:45:48.414]  We're on the march.
[00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:49.595]  Let's skip the break.
[00:45:50.475 --> 00:45:52.436]  I mean, seriously, let's bring John Harmon in here.
[00:45:52.456 --> 00:45:53.016]  No, stay in here.
[00:45:53.336 --> 00:45:53.996]  Stay in here, Paul.
[00:45:54.136 --> 00:45:54.677]  Oh, awesome.
[00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:58.524]  Keep Paul here in studio with us, doing a great job.
[00:45:59.665 --> 00:46:02.068]  Harmon, what about John Harmon up in Minnesota?
[00:46:02.429 --> 00:46:06.935]  I mean, I think that they found a new phenomenon that makes buildings collapse with small fires.
[00:46:07.576 --> 00:46:09.879]  They said never before seen, but in three buildings in one day.
[00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:10.920]  Makes perfect sense.
[00:46:11.601 --> 00:46:14.122]  Have the cops saying, get back, we're being told they're blowing it up, doesn't matter.
[00:46:14.342 --> 00:46:20.564]  Have the blast points, the seismographs, the molten steel, thousands of degrees above what kerosene jet fuel burns.
[00:46:21.244 --> 00:46:23.764]  And now if they beat you to death, it isn't that, it's a syndrome.
[00:46:23.784 --> 00:46:25.925]  They taser you, they say it's a syndrome here in the U.S.
[00:46:26.145 --> 00:46:29.626]  They will sue coroners if they say it was the electroshock.
[00:46:29.906 --> 00:46:34.087]  Now they're beefing them up from 50,000 volts to 75,000 volts, I'm sure.
[00:46:34.407 --> 00:46:36.328]  The daily taser death toll is okay.
[00:46:36.648 --> 00:46:39.729]  John Harmon, you believe this is a new syndrome, don't you?
[00:46:40.109 --> 00:46:41.330]  Oh yeah, the new syndrome.
[00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.950]  Oh yeah, it's going around spreading.
[00:46:43.391 --> 00:46:49.973]  You better watch out, you know, just like you're trained by the KGB and also Al-Qaeda and whatever else.
[00:46:51.334 --> 00:47:00.598]  But I mean, yeah, I mean, don't, I mean, listen, listen, you get pulled over for no driver's license, or you get pulled over with the... I mean, you know, you just, that's actually my microphone.
[00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:03.099]  The outside one is mine.
[00:47:03.399 --> 00:47:04.320]  I have no audio, Commander.
[00:47:05.307 --> 00:47:06.232]  I've lost all audio here.
[00:47:06.473 --> 00:47:07.015]  You can't hear me?
[00:47:07.538 --> 00:47:08.623]  No, John, I can't hear you.
[00:47:08.643 --> 00:47:09.788]  I'm going to have to go over there and do it.
[00:47:11.257 --> 00:47:11.897]  Alright, there we go.
[00:47:11.917 --> 00:47:12.958]  Oh, I've got audio back.
[00:47:13.478 --> 00:47:15.139]  I figured it out.
[00:47:15.159 --> 00:47:16.880]  I connected the dots right there, you know?
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.661]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:47:17.721 --> 00:47:18.721]  That was a syndrome.
[00:47:19.102 --> 00:47:21.803]  That wasn't you turning down my headphones and I lost audio.
[00:47:21.863 --> 00:47:27.186]  That was a syndrome that suddenly there's a new syndrome where knobs turn themselves down by themselves.
[00:47:27.346 --> 00:47:29.207]  I'm going to get it by the end of this hour.
[00:47:29.247 --> 00:47:29.908]  You're going to learn.
[00:47:29.928 --> 00:47:31.168]  There's no government corruption.
[00:47:31.469 --> 00:47:32.529]  There's not $4 trillion.
[00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:36.632]  Well, there is $4 trillion missing from the Pentagon, but they say that's a syndrome too.
[00:47:37.532 --> 00:47:38.732]  So you've got to learn here.
[00:47:38.913 --> 00:47:42.494]  Somebody beats you in the head and Billy clubs you and tasers you and you die.
[00:47:42.514 --> 00:47:43.754]  It wasn't that, it was the syndrome.
[00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:45.275]  If the shoe fits.
[00:47:46.035 --> 00:47:49.336]  John Harmon, now that I have your audio back, again, tell me more about syndromes.
[00:47:49.396 --> 00:47:52.557]  I mean, if you have a car wreck, just tell the cops it's a syndrome.
[00:47:53.158 --> 00:47:56.159]  I forgot my license, sir, but you know, it's a syndrome.
[00:47:57.179 --> 00:47:58.019]  It's with the times.
[00:47:58.739 --> 00:48:05.402]  Just like I was saying before, you're trained by the KGB and Al-Qaeda and whatever else they want.
[00:48:06.144 --> 00:48:08.546]  And the dollar's strong and the government never lies to us.
[00:48:08.646 --> 00:48:10.227]  And TV's good.
[00:48:11.468 --> 00:48:13.450]  And Russia attacked Georgia.
[00:48:15.652 --> 00:48:18.594]  Seriously, Paul Hartman, any final comments on the new syndrome?
[00:48:18.654 --> 00:48:20.916]  Sudden death or arrest may be new syndrome.
[00:48:22.277 --> 00:48:22.938]  When in Rome.
[00:48:24.286 --> 00:48:27.127]  I don't know, I just feel like butchering cliches today.
[00:48:27.447 --> 00:48:35.610]  But I mean, let's say you go out and you beat somebody to death, hypothetically, or I do, and I come up and I've got a club and the person's in a bloody pool, or I shoot them!
[00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:37.310]  Going to jail?
[00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.391]  No, no, I'll say, Officer, it's a syndrome!
[00:48:40.732 --> 00:48:47.394]  I mean, let's say I go by a taser, I taser somebody to death, I taser them 20 times, they die, and then the cops show up and I say, No, Officer, it's a syndrome!
[00:48:48.933 --> 00:48:50.293]  You want to do a case study on this?
[00:48:50.333 --> 00:48:52.454]  Maybe they've got to play along with the false reality.
[00:48:52.494 --> 00:48:54.275]  I bet they'll say, OK, you're free to go.
[00:48:54.795 --> 00:48:57.576]  This guy, this 15-year-old just died of a heart attack.
[00:48:57.916 --> 00:48:58.556]  It's a syndrome.
[00:48:58.896 --> 00:48:59.837]  Just show them the article.
[00:48:59.877 --> 00:49:01.997]  Let's come back right now to the full audience.
[00:49:02.017 --> 00:49:02.358]  Stay there.
[00:49:02.378 --> 00:49:02.658]  Stay there.
[00:49:02.678 --> 00:49:03.218]  You're not leaving.
[00:49:03.978 --> 00:49:04.918]  Make you sit in here now.
[00:49:06.979 --> 00:49:07.539]  Look at him out there.
[00:49:07.579 --> 00:49:08.860]  Hour 30 plus.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.660]  Aaron working feverishly.
[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.381]  He is an absolutely awesome creature.
[00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:15.122]  Half-man, half-amazing.
[00:49:15.842 --> 00:49:17.223]  Half-man, half-amazing.
[00:49:17.263 --> 00:49:18.283]  That's Aaron Dykes.
[00:49:20.271 --> 00:49:31.578]  To get serious here, Aaron is amazing, but I was just talking about the behind the scenes for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and Infowars.com streams where we skip the breaks sometimes.
[00:49:33.119 --> 00:49:42.704]  If Paul Hartman, our new IT guy, if he was, yes he really exists, people thought I was making that up, here he is on TV right now, see?
[00:49:45.006 --> 00:49:52.510]  If Paul was to go out and buy a taser, and you tasered somebody 15-20 times and they died, when the cops show up, just say it's a syndrome.
[00:49:52.550 --> 00:50:05.036]  He did not die from the taser, and taser will sue anybody that, you know, or any medical examiner that says, there's been thousands of cases, you know, says that death by taser, all over the world, over 500 down in the U.S., they say that isn't real.
[00:50:05.056 --> 00:50:06.797]  They have their own doctors that say it's a syndrome.
[00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:10.339]  But see, now the syndrome's spreading to where they kill 60 people in Madrid,
[00:50:11.059 --> 00:50:14.323]  And the cops kill young men, and they're not killing them, it's a syndrome.
[00:50:14.704 --> 00:50:25.037]  So like I said, next time if you ever get mad at anybody out there, you ever shoot your wife, ever shoot your husband, they got a bloody bullet hole in them or taser darts in them, just say it's a syndrome.
[00:50:25.057 --> 00:50:26.058]  Paul, this is a great new system.
[00:50:29.189 --> 00:50:30.951]  Listen, the demolition companies are out of business.
[00:50:30.971 --> 00:50:41.463]  All you have to do is set a few small fires and any steel skyrise, it'll collapse perfectly with a better implosion in on itself than a ten million dollar controlled demolition.
[00:50:42.358 --> 00:50:48.480]  I think we should stop all the AIDS and cancer research we're doing and just go straight into syndrome research.
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.861]  Because if it keeps on going on the pace that it's going on right now, we're done.
[00:50:52.041 --> 00:50:52.881]  Well, it's like sudden death.
[00:50:52.941 --> 00:50:56.402]  And of course all the real studies say the vaccines are killing the babies.
[00:50:56.442 --> 00:50:58.483]  You know, you take them in for their second, third round of shots.
[00:50:58.663 --> 00:51:00.463]  Sometimes newborn, they get, you know, ten shots.
[00:51:00.783 --> 00:51:01.904]  They die of a convulsion.
[00:51:01.964 --> 00:51:03.544]  The brain has inflammation.
[00:51:04.004 --> 00:51:05.305]  The hospital's got to cover that up.
[00:51:05.365 --> 00:51:08.566]  But why not just kill the parent's child?
[00:51:09.026 --> 00:51:09.566]  Why when you can...
[00:51:10.126 --> 00:51:12.947]  Bring them up on the news and have the woman crying, saying she's innocent.
[00:51:13.427 --> 00:51:14.867]  And the cops say, we'll go easy on you.
[00:51:14.887 --> 00:51:15.948]  Don't you remember shaking them?
[00:51:15.988 --> 00:51:17.048]  And they go, I guess.
[00:51:17.568 --> 00:51:19.509]  Okay, you're only getting five years in prison, bitch.
[00:51:20.169 --> 00:51:21.769]  And I'm sorry, that's how it works.
[00:51:21.909 --> 00:51:26.131]  We're not only going to kill your baby, we're going to send you to prison!
[00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:27.371]  Because it's a syndrome!
[00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:28.111]  You shook her!
[00:51:28.551 --> 00:51:30.012]  You shook the baby woman!
[00:51:30.572 --> 00:51:33.473]  But the baby started having a convulsion on the way home from the hospital from the shots.
[00:51:33.913 --> 00:51:34.453]  Shut up!
[00:51:36.074 --> 00:51:36.454]  Shut up!
[00:51:36.534 --> 00:51:36.894]  Shut up!
[00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:37.414]  Shut up!
[00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:39.849]  Man, it's ironic.
[00:51:39.869 --> 00:51:41.851]  I've been meaning to tell you about this about two weeks ago.
[00:51:41.871 --> 00:51:50.978]  Me and my wife had a crucially intense argument about the whole vaccine thing.
[00:51:51.078 --> 00:51:52.239]  And I was like, you know what?
[00:51:52.379 --> 00:51:55.321]  This is right after the day you were going off on the HPV thing.
[00:51:55.361 --> 00:51:56.282]  You were playing the commercial.
[00:51:56.302 --> 00:52:01.225]  Oh, I mean, I have the British Medical Journal and hundreds of other hearers admitting it's giving you diabetes.
[00:52:01.286 --> 00:52:01.886]  I mean, it's so wonderful.
[00:52:01.926 --> 00:52:09.847]  Yeah, and I was just like, hey, you know, let's talk about this whole HPV bit, you know, because I've been learning a lot about- I actually punched my hand too hard, ow!
[00:52:10.709 --> 00:52:12.210]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:18.815]  But yeah, and then her mom got in the mix, and she's a nurse, and of course I don't know anything compared to her.
[00:52:18.936 --> 00:52:20.537]  What about the British Medical Journal?
[00:52:20.557 --> 00:52:21.237]  You want to bring her that one?
[00:52:21.257 --> 00:52:26.381]  Well, I even said, I was like, well what if I was to show you medical journals saying that this leads to that?
[00:52:26.802 --> 00:52:31.786]  Would you still be gung-ho about the whole HPV vaccine bit and everything?
[00:52:31.826 --> 00:52:35.709]  And then I threw in the whole Perry's, wasn't Perry's wife?
[00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:39.832]  Yeah, they've been paid off, and it's also, what about killing a bunch of people?
[00:52:39.912 --> 00:52:42.834]  I mean, well, the whole money trail thing was way more about smoking.
[00:52:42.854 --> 00:52:45.776]  Yeah, but I mean, it's killing a bunch of people, and it's causing diabetes.
[00:52:46.157 --> 00:52:49.819]  Yeah, you know, and not... But that's just, not just that shot, and so you're wise.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.641]  Well, think of the quandary I'm in now.
[00:52:51.661 --> 00:52:56.004]  I got my three-year-old daughter, I got another one on the way, we don't know if it's a boy or a girl.
[00:52:56.024 --> 00:53:00.708]  Well, they don't say inject them until they're eleven or twelve, because they don't think it'll be too obvious if it kills them too quick.
[00:53:00.728 --> 00:53:03.430]  So I got about nine more years to convince her.
[00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:04.971]  Well, here's what you convince your wife of.
[00:53:05.231 --> 00:53:07.232]  She's going to be told it's the law to take all these.
[00:53:07.252 --> 00:53:08.913]  You just go show her there is no law.
[00:53:08.933 --> 00:53:14.637]  And honey, even if this is good, why are they hoaxing and lying and saying it's the law you've got to take these shots?
[00:53:16.518 --> 00:53:18.759]  It's going to take a while to get through to my old lady, man.
[00:53:18.919 --> 00:53:19.340]  I don't know.
[00:53:20.774 --> 00:53:22.716]  She's just like everybody else.
[00:53:22.736 --> 00:53:24.559]  Just like a woman gets in the car with Ted Bundy.
[00:53:24.619 --> 00:53:31.126]  Yeah, it's kind of like when I was about the guy that jumped off the bridge after he hogtied himself and everything.
[00:53:31.146 --> 00:53:36.172]  You know, I'm talking just normal people, regular, not on-air people at my job.
[00:53:37.017 --> 00:53:39.758]  And I'm like, yo, this doesn't sound fishy at all.
[00:53:40.038 --> 00:53:41.318]  I mean, come on now.
[00:53:41.659 --> 00:53:47.000]  You can't hogtie yourself and then write... And you're at KI where you guys heard the first scan reports.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:48.581]  Cops fished him out and said he'd been murdered.
[00:53:49.041 --> 00:53:50.621]  But then the official story came in.
[00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:53.362]  That's just crazy.
[00:53:53.402 --> 00:53:54.022]  I don't even know.
[00:53:56.829 --> 00:54:00.131]  For me, like always, I just want to know what's real, you know, that's all it is.
[00:54:00.471 --> 00:54:01.112]  Well, no, no, no.
[00:54:01.132 --> 00:54:07.736]  Listen, he tied himself and tortured it, sliced his body open and sliced his arms and legs open and pulled his intestines out.
[00:54:07.776 --> 00:54:08.637]  I mean, he did it himself.
[00:54:09.457 --> 00:54:11.159]  And the government says so, so everything's fine.
[00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:11.839]  It's a syndrome.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:14.241]  It's a syndrome.
[00:54:14.441 --> 00:54:18.383]  I'm telling you, stop the AIDS research and we've got to get on this syndrome, man.
[00:54:18.644 --> 00:54:19.304]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:54:19.344 --> 00:54:20.405]  You need to explain to your wife.
[00:54:21.505 --> 00:54:23.285]  God bless her, and you need to protect those children.
[00:54:23.325 --> 00:54:25.126]  And I understand.
[00:54:25.146 --> 00:54:29.207]  I mean, look, Charlie Sheen's wife basically divorced him over the vaccine issue.
[00:54:29.907 --> 00:54:30.847]  I mean, they're nuts.
[00:54:30.947 --> 00:54:35.348]  They explained to her that 50 years ago there were only three or four.
[00:54:35.488 --> 00:54:37.209]  Now there's 60-something they want to give a baby.
[00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:44.010]  Explained to her that they lied about mercury being in it, and then now they admit it's in it, and they admit, the federal government admits it gave them autism.
[00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:44.971]  And it's still in there.
[00:54:45.591 --> 00:54:46.391]  And then show her,
[00:54:47.813 --> 00:54:52.514]  How autism's gone from 1 in 20-something thousand to now 1 in 86.
[00:54:52.554 --> 00:54:52.854]  Okay?
[00:54:53.074 --> 00:55:03.736]  I mean, give her the data and explain to her the British Medical Journal and the American Medical Journal and all these other journals, they are more prestigious than the nurse.
[00:55:04.356 --> 00:55:07.097]  But see, that nurse is injecting people all day because that's the policy.
[00:55:07.377 --> 00:55:10.638]  So she's going to rationalize that what she's doing is good.
[00:55:11.198 --> 00:55:12.238]  And they're all on these power trips.
[00:55:13.749 --> 00:55:15.470]  Ask this nurse, is that the mother-in-law?
[00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:19.492]  Ask the nurse, say, oh, do you have a health department computers there, don't you?
[00:55:19.552 --> 00:55:24.094]  And you get people to report on themselves, and it's all jacked into the government without their due process.
[00:55:24.155 --> 00:55:28.617]  And she'll then start thinking, going, yeah, whatever happened to America?
[00:55:28.677 --> 00:55:31.418]  See, they've been put in these petty jail guard positions.
[00:55:31.478 --> 00:55:34.680]  School teachers, nurses, and they're all little jail guards.
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.560]  They think it's real funny.
[00:55:35.961 --> 00:55:37.101]  Like when you have your baby.
[00:55:37.321 --> 00:55:39.763]  Doesn't matter if the mom-in-law is a nurse.
[00:55:40.123 --> 00:55:41.484]  Notice that the nurse will say, honey,
[00:55:42.384 --> 00:55:44.085]  Paul, take this downstairs for me.
[00:55:44.105 --> 00:55:44.885]  Have you had that happen?
[00:55:45.265 --> 00:55:45.905]  I mean, do you remember?
[00:55:45.945 --> 00:55:47.626]  Take this file downstairs for me.
[00:55:47.926 --> 00:55:49.426]  And they go, tell me, is he beating you?
[00:55:49.986 --> 00:55:50.286]  No.
[00:55:50.506 --> 00:55:51.427]  Well, do you have enough money?
[00:55:51.807 --> 00:55:53.267]  You say you don't have enough money.
[00:55:53.888 --> 00:55:55.168]  They're going to try to snatch your kids.
[00:55:55.208 --> 00:55:57.068]  This is the hardcore criminal.
[00:55:57.369 --> 00:56:00.309]  But see, they've been told by higher-ups and authority figures.
[00:56:00.329 --> 00:56:01.530]  They did Stanford research.
[00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:08.792]  Yale also did it, where they found over 90% of people, if ordered by a professor, in an experiment, would murder people.
[00:56:08.872 --> 00:56:10.613]  You know, they did those mock jails.
[00:56:11.313 --> 00:56:22.916]  And they found, in one study it was like 96, the other was 94, you can pull these up, they found that people would believe they were murdering someone, but because the school ordered it, and a guy in a uniform ordered it, they would commit the murder.
[00:56:23.796 --> 00:56:25.157]  Now these are graduate students.
[00:56:26.226 --> 00:56:32.647]  So you understand, I'm not saying your mother-in-law is bad, but she's incrementally been phased in to where she's now a eugenics officer.
[00:56:33.888 --> 00:56:34.748]  On the command deck.
[00:56:35.148 --> 00:56:36.588]  Hurling death left and right.
[00:56:37.288 --> 00:56:38.128]  And they just don't know.
[00:56:38.689 --> 00:56:40.749]  See, I mean, that's how inculcated it is, Paul.
[00:56:41.529 --> 00:56:43.650]  I mean, I've got literally hundreds of... Here, here, here.
[00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:44.510]  Watch this right now.
[00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:53.452]  I will go online, and I will type, vaccines, vaccines, diabetes.
[00:56:53.492 --> 00:56:54.272]  Hasteful vaccines.
[00:56:55.287 --> 00:56:57.449]  V-A-C-I-N-E-S?
[00:56:57.589 --> 00:57:00.232]  I always spell it so bad that it... Two C's.
[00:57:00.612 --> 00:57:03.195]  Okay, two C's, that's what I was thinking.
[00:57:04.456 --> 00:57:09.742]  Vaccines, autism, no, no, it's... I want vaccines and diabetes.
[00:57:09.802 --> 00:57:11.523]  Di-a-b-e-t-i-es.
[00:57:11.564 --> 00:57:12.685]  Don't laugh at my spelling there.
[00:57:12.705 --> 00:57:17.089]  Hey, but you can't die from... I mean, you can die from diabetes, but, you know, it's not bad.
[00:57:19.291 --> 00:57:20.692]  See, I looked at studies.
[00:57:20.712 --> 00:57:24.414]  People are drinking as much sugar and processed sugars as they were 20 years ago.
[00:57:25.114 --> 00:57:29.176]  In fact, people are actually drinking less in many of the studies, depending on the region.
[00:57:29.797 --> 00:57:30.997]  The South is actually worse.
[00:57:31.037 --> 00:57:32.598]  We drink even more now than people used to.
[00:57:32.618 --> 00:57:36.540]  But the point is, why then is diabetes going up thousands of percentage points every year?
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:41.503]  Why is lung cancer up six-fold in women in one decade, though smoking is down?
[00:57:42.803 --> 00:57:43.724]  And this is in young women.
[00:57:44.557 --> 00:57:47.139]  Because it's in particular vaccines.
[00:57:47.859 --> 00:57:49.180]  They put the stuff in there, man.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.821]  You can't get these yuppies to admit it.
[00:57:50.841 --> 00:57:52.001]  They gotta die first!
[00:57:52.221 --> 00:57:54.743]  So there's a vaccine out there giving people lung cancer?
[00:57:54.803 --> 00:57:55.463]  Absolutely!
[00:57:55.964 --> 00:57:57.364]  Oh, man.
[00:57:57.404 --> 00:57:58.885]  Most of the eugenics is targeting women.
[00:58:00.026 --> 00:58:00.206]  Why?
[00:58:00.226 --> 00:58:01.807]  That's why most of these women are sterile now.
[00:58:01.867 --> 00:58:05.389]  They just give the men... Listen, I can show you this.
[00:58:05.489 --> 00:58:06.510]  I can show you all of it.
[00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:08.170]  I can't sleep at night knowing this stuff.
[00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.891]  It's all right here.
[00:58:09.411 --> 00:58:11.552]  I typed in vaccines, diabetes, 2,170,000 hits.
[00:58:17.992 --> 00:58:20.653]  Now, let me go through this.
[00:58:22.253 --> 00:58:27.715]  NCCN, vaccine, immunization dangers, it's all mainstream news.
[00:58:27.775 --> 00:58:30.836]  I don't get why the New World Order hates women so much.
[00:58:30.856 --> 00:58:31.836]  Because they create babies.
[00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:34.637]  They always tell them how much they love them.
[00:58:36.017 --> 00:58:42.719]  The point is, is that I'm looking at the American Journal, British journals, Chinese journals, Japanese journals.
[00:58:43.689 --> 00:58:46.672]  I'm looking at WebMD.
[00:58:46.732 --> 00:58:53.499]  I mean, it's all mainstream, in study after study after study after study after study, and it says why.
[00:58:53.579 --> 00:58:58.124]  It's causing an autoimmune inflammation in every gland and organ of the body.
[00:58:58.384 --> 00:59:03.649]  Your heart swells up, your brain swells up, your pancreas swells up, and it's a very delicate organ.
[00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:05.832]  All right, well let me play Devil's Advocate for two seconds.
[00:59:08.388 --> 00:59:15.695]  If maybe the rationale is, well, you'd rather have diabetes than smallpox or, you know, the mumps or whatever.
[00:59:15.775 --> 00:59:16.655]  Well, you can debate.
[00:59:16.736 --> 00:59:17.496]  See, here's the deal.
[00:59:17.516 --> 00:59:22.461]  You can debate whether they're doing it on purpose or whether they just don't care and let this stuff happen.
[00:59:22.721 --> 00:59:24.362]  And the evidence is they're doing it on purpose.
[00:59:25.387 --> 00:59:26.108]  They're doing it all.
[00:59:26.288 --> 00:59:31.512]  Listen, they have caught over a hundred vaccine makers of a tetanus shot that the UN buys from.
[00:59:31.552 --> 00:59:36.096]  That's the payoff of the country, is they manufacture it there and then pay more than what it's worth.
[00:59:36.496 --> 00:59:49.307]  A very expensive female hormone that's only secreted at the start of the second trimester, which then attacks the baby, the gland shuts down, they have a violent miscarriage, and then it causes chronic inflammation in that particular gland.
[00:59:50.222 --> 00:59:56.307]  Now, over a hundred manufacturers accidentally add a female hormone that is not involved in any of the production parameters.
[00:59:57.268 --> 00:59:58.429]  They are adding it, brother.
[00:59:58.689 --> 01:00:03.152]  Because, see, if you add that hormone, and I've had medical doctors on talk about this, this is mainstream news.
[01:00:03.753 --> 01:00:08.296]  If you add that hormone to the tetanus pathogen, it then creates an autoimmunity to the hormone.
[01:00:10.678 --> 01:00:14.441]  And these women don't know, they have abortion after abortion after abortion.
[01:00:14.842 --> 01:00:18.565]  The second trimester starts, three months, boom, that baby dies.
[01:00:20.202 --> 01:00:24.385]  Now, in some villages, they come, like in Thailand and other places, it's all on video.
[01:00:25.006 --> 01:00:27.628]  I've posted it on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:00:27.648 --> 01:00:34.894]  The police pull up while you're pregnant and inject the women and the women say, I feel the baby, it starts having convulsions in me.
[01:00:35.154 --> 01:00:38.156]  Then the baby dies and I have miscarriage next day.
[01:00:38.496 --> 01:00:40.338]  And the troops come in, all U.S.
[01:00:40.378 --> 01:00:45.602]  funded, pull in injectors, the women run, they chase them like planet of the apes into the woods.
[01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:47.523]  This is black ops, brother!
[01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:48.905]  This is the real world, man!
[01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:51.487]  This is hell force!
[01:00:53.428 --> 01:00:53.869]  It's rough.
[01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:58.212]  And you've got all these yuppies making jokes, and all these people think it's real funny.
[01:00:58.252 --> 01:00:59.914]  It isn't funny, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:01:03.256 --> 01:01:03.977]  And then it doesn't matter.
[01:01:04.037 --> 01:01:08.581]  People are lying about me and attacking me in the mainstream news, the patriot movement, everybody.
[01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:10.122]  I don't know why everybody's so jealous of me.
[01:01:10.162 --> 01:01:14.766]  I'm just somebody who studies this and talks about it and covers it, and it's so depressing I can't hardly do it anymore.
[01:01:15.326 --> 01:01:18.229]  Hey man, jealousy is one of the, you know,
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.761]  That's just a basic human emotion.
[01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:27.804]  But the enemies always make crap up about you in the media, the alternative media, to then demonize you so they can carry out their criminal acts.
[01:01:27.824 --> 01:01:31.246]  But the way that they're winning is, you know, you can't let them...
[01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:37.629]  They're winning if you just let them deter you.
[01:01:37.649 --> 01:01:39.410]  No, no, no, but Paul, nothing's deterring me.
[01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:44.511]  My point is, it freaks me out because we're under biochemical, radiological attack.
[01:01:45.031 --> 01:01:46.412]  There is no doubt of it.
[01:01:46.852 --> 01:01:57.776]  I am totally freaked out about this, and it's just a side issue of, then Michelle Malkin hates me and wants to put me in a camp, and these other people run around, and a lot of them really think they're doing good.
[01:01:58.396 --> 01:01:59.896]  I mean, it's crazy, man.
[01:02:00.156 --> 01:02:01.437]  If you just keep on keeping on,
[01:02:02.077 --> 01:02:02.738]  You'll be alright, man.
[01:02:02.758 --> 01:02:03.739]  Trust me.
[01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:07.784]  But I'm not alright, because I know they're killing these women and children all around me.
[01:02:07.804 --> 01:02:08.906]  I know they're a bunch of bastards.
[01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:13.532]  It totally freaks me out that they've got your wife under their control, and I'm sure your wife's a smart person.
[01:02:13.572 --> 01:02:14.293]  I'm not knocking her.
[01:02:14.873 --> 01:02:20.621]  I know she's a good person, and because she's not evil, she's judging the world according to how she operates.
[01:02:22.005 --> 01:02:22.766]  And that's why they win.
[01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:23.506]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.526 --> 01:02:24.988]  What do you think about that?
[01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:37.539]  Uh, I mean, when you put it in terms like that, there's only one thing you can do, and that's just, you know, put your faith in your Creator, and that's all I can do.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.560]  Oh, I agree.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:39.762]  So that's what I said to the police.
[01:02:40.422 --> 01:02:41.443]  I get into petty stuff.
[01:02:41.543 --> 01:02:42.224]  I bash you.
[01:02:42.464 --> 01:02:43.445]  I do things I might not.
[01:02:43.465 --> 01:02:45.006]  I mean, I understand you've got tough jobs.
[01:02:45.347 --> 01:02:47.388]  My point is, evil forces are running this country.
[01:02:47.669 --> 01:02:50.611]  You're being used, and they're shooting your kids up with cancer viruses, too.
[01:02:51.092 --> 01:02:52.353]  And you're drinking deadly fluoride.
[01:02:52.413 --> 01:02:54.275]  And I just want you to listen to me!
[01:02:54.715 --> 01:02:57.618]  I want you to check out what I'm saying and find out I'm telling you the truth!
[01:02:58.781 --> 01:02:59.182]  You're good.
[01:02:59.242 --> 01:03:09.027]  Slowly but surely, people are realizing that, you know, and the only way I feel that I can do anything about it is to just be a good father to my kids and lead them in the right direction.
[01:03:09.047 --> 01:03:09.507]  Well, you are good.
[01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:18.892]  And I'm hoping, you know, and hopefully you keep on doing what you're doing and all those mothers and fathers will get that in their head and, you know, maybe lead by example.
[01:03:18.912 --> 01:03:19.952]  I mean, exactly.
[01:03:19.972 --> 01:03:21.793]  These vaccines just ravage people.
[01:03:22.373 --> 01:03:23.454]  They just ravage them.
[01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:27.128]  Man, one of these days, everything will come full circle, man.
[01:03:27.148 --> 01:03:38.613]  Hell, it came out that Bayer, for a decade, sent out over 100 million ampules of Factor VIII, which every one of them had HIV and hepatitis in it, and it killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:03:40.414 --> 01:03:41.254]  I see you freaking out there.
[01:03:41.274 --> 01:03:42.895]  Let me type in Factor VIII Bayer.
[01:03:42.935 --> 01:03:43.355]  Watch this.
[01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:47.997]  Factor VIII Bayer.
[01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:48.297]  B-A-Y-E-R.
[01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:53.411]  Factor 8 Bayer.
[01:03:54.232 --> 01:03:55.773]  Bayer Biological Products.
[01:03:57.614 --> 01:04:00.436]  This is their sales pitch area.
[01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:03.659]  Wikipedia.
[01:04:03.679 --> 01:04:08.163]  Now this is something where they really tried to keep it out of the top
[01:04:10.011 --> 01:04:11.191]  Recombinant factor.
[01:04:11.211 --> 01:04:12.152]  Let's click video.
[01:04:12.172 --> 01:04:13.592]  I've got an MSNBC report.
[01:04:13.612 --> 01:04:15.672]  I'm surprised it's not in the top ones.
[01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:16.913]  They're really covering this up.
[01:04:17.393 --> 01:04:20.014]  Bayer exposed HIV contaminated vaccine.
[01:04:20.514 --> 01:04:22.194]  Now listen to this right here, folks.
[01:04:22.714 --> 01:04:24.095]  This is MSNBC.
[01:04:24.195 --> 01:04:27.436]  I'm going to play it right now.
[01:04:31.917 --> 01:04:32.977]  Oh God, it's not playing.
[01:04:33.677 --> 01:04:34.798]  I'm gonna start it over.
[01:04:50.775 --> 01:05:01.185]  Internal documents show that after this company positively, absolutely knew that they had a medication that was infected with the AIDS virus, they took the product off the market in the U.S.
[01:05:01.225 --> 01:05:04.168]  and then they dumped it in France, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
[01:05:04.548 --> 01:05:06.109]  The medicine's called Factor VIII.
[01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:10.914]  It was an injection medicine that was used for hemophiliacs, mostly children.
[01:05:11.054 --> 01:05:12.956]  Children had been born with an incurable disease.
[01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:13.596]  Hold on, hold on, Mike.
[01:05:13.796 --> 01:05:14.417]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:24.942]  So you're telling me that Bayer knew that this drug was infected with the AIDS virus, they yanked it from the market in America, and then they dumped it in markets overseas?
[01:05:25.262 --> 01:05:30.164]  They had to figure out a way, Joe, to make a profit on a product that they could not sell in America.
[01:05:30.484 --> 01:05:32.445]  So they made a huge profit.
[01:05:32.505 --> 01:05:34.586]  They dropped the product in Japan, Spain, and France.
[01:05:34.886 --> 01:05:38.888]  By the way, Joe, government officials in France that allowed that to happen.
[01:05:39.448 --> 01:05:40.488]  Yeah, well here's the deal.
[01:05:40.528 --> 01:05:43.029]  I've got to get a laptop that doesn't sound like a helicopter taking off.
[01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:44.949]  Just Google Factor 8 Bay Area.
[01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:46.250]  I know you're laughing, cops!
[01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:49.450]  I know it's funny, you work for the system, ha ha!
[01:05:49.951 --> 01:05:57.672]  You know, you've got a million dead people here, probably more, but they're just mentioning the age.
[01:05:57.952 --> 01:05:59.593]  It's full of hepatitis, everything else.
[01:06:00.313 --> 01:06:01.094]  See, they don't care.
[01:06:01.634 --> 01:06:04.736]  See, it's the illegal aliens with the trichinosis killing everybody in Austin now.
[01:06:04.976 --> 01:06:08.079]  Notice how they keep that real quiet, but everybody knows a neighbor who's gotten sick.
[01:06:08.579 --> 01:06:11.121]  See, it's all kept real quiet, and the leprosy's kept real quiet.
[01:06:11.821 --> 01:06:13.042]  Now, am I against the illegal aliens?
[01:06:13.142 --> 01:06:14.883]  No, the point is they've got to be medically tested.
[01:06:15.324 --> 01:06:18.566]  But the government says, give up all your rights, the terrorists are going to get you.
[01:06:19.046 --> 01:06:20.788]  Meanwhile, we have plagues upon us.
[01:06:21.618 --> 01:06:22.299]  They don't care.
[01:06:22.319 --> 01:06:23.681]  It's all eugenics.
[01:06:24.262 --> 01:06:29.971]  It's all about bankrupting the state medical systems so the feds can come in and fully federalize under government health care.
[01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:33.035]  You will be forced to take vaccines, all of you.
[01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:34.998]  This is a murdering government.
[01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:37.101]  I want you to know, people laughing.
[01:06:38.044 --> 01:06:41.006]  When your child's dying, I'm trying to stop that, but you're laughing.
[01:06:41.386 --> 01:06:48.091]  When you're dying, before your time, remember, we tried to warn you, we tried to save you, but you had to love your masters.
[01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:49.532]  You had to lick their boots.
[01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.914]  We're going to skip this break too at InfoWars.com on those streams.
[01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.837]  Okay, Paul, I'm going to keep you in here a little bit more.
[01:06:59.337 --> 01:07:00.699]  So tell me.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.823]  See, anything I say, I can pull up right now here.
[01:07:05.504 --> 01:07:06.305]  Anything I tell you.
[01:07:06.465 --> 01:07:06.865]  I got you.
[01:07:06.945 --> 01:07:09.188]  In fact, many times worse than MSNBC.
[01:07:09.768 --> 01:07:11.570]  Anything I'm telling you is in triplicate.
[01:07:11.971 --> 01:07:13.532]  Believe me, I wish this wasn't true.
[01:07:13.593 --> 01:07:14.714]  I wish none of this was true.
[01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:21.476]  Do you think these killers like me, they haven't killed me because I'm so spot on, they don't want people to go look at what I've said.
[01:07:21.857 --> 01:07:25.201]  They want to hit me with COINTELPRO and disinformation from a thousand different angles.
[01:07:25.602 --> 01:07:27.224]  Which is fine, I can take that.
[01:07:27.784 --> 01:07:31.930]  The point is viewers out there need to know I'm under attack because I understand their program.
[01:07:34.642 --> 01:07:36.003]  I mean, it's sad.
[01:07:37.144 --> 01:07:49.555]  I don't know, it's like, I know something is up, you know, no disrespect, you know I love you to death, but you know, I can't say I fully buy into 100% of everything, but I know that something is going on.
[01:07:50.276 --> 01:07:51.497]  Well, let's see, it gets a lot deeper.
[01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:52.197]  Yeah.
[01:07:53.158 --> 01:07:57.424]  I mean, how would a company for a decade knowingly ship HIV-filled drugs to everybody?
[01:07:57.524 --> 01:07:58.886]  Yeah, that's just cold.
[01:07:59.427 --> 01:08:01.610]  But it isn't just about profit.
[01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.853]  Bayer was involved with the Nazis.
[01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:04.734]  So was IBM.
[01:08:05.054 --> 01:08:05.895]  It's eugenics.
[01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:10.141]  You heard that top academic we just had on talking about it's all a eugenics plan.
[01:08:10.982 --> 01:08:12.724]  They know the GMO is hurting you.
[01:08:13.484 --> 01:08:14.685]  They know it's poisoning.
[01:08:14.766 --> 01:08:15.967]  It's all by design.
[01:08:15.987 --> 01:08:24.334]  I hope this doesn't sound too stupid, but my freshman year in college, I learned something about anomagopoly.
[01:08:24.574 --> 01:08:25.355]  Isn't that illegal?
[01:08:25.575 --> 01:08:27.317]  It's a cartel or consortium, yeah.
[01:08:27.717 --> 01:08:30.298]  So, like, isn't that all illegal?
[01:08:30.338 --> 01:08:37.580]  Like, Bayer and IBM being owned, you know, all these big corporations that you're saying... They're called cartels, yeah.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:39.440]  ...being owned by the same people.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.141]  So isn't that self-illegal?
[01:08:42.301 --> 01:08:43.181]  Am I wrong?
[01:08:43.481 --> 01:08:45.982]  Yes, but the laws are only made for us, the slaves.
[01:08:47.362 --> 01:08:48.703]  The laws are only for us.
[01:08:48.723 --> 01:08:49.763]  They're not for the elites, Paul.
[01:08:51.038 --> 01:08:52.939]  Well, how do you get to be one of those elites, huh?
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:58.564]  You gotta go to Harvard and be in the... No, no, most of those are low, but why would you want, you wouldn't want to be one of them, would you?
[01:08:58.844 --> 01:08:59.104]  No.
[01:08:59.805 --> 01:09:00.005]  No.
[01:09:01.306 --> 01:09:02.787]  I mean, let me ask you a question.
[01:09:02.907 --> 01:09:03.127]  Alright.
[01:09:03.527 --> 01:09:09.972]  Would you give your eyes up, if I offered you $10,000 to go have a surgery right now to have your eyes taken out, would you do it?
[01:09:11.654 --> 01:09:12.374]  Why would I do that?
[01:09:12.875 --> 01:09:15.416]  I'm asking you, would you sell me your eyes for $10,000?
[01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:16.217]  Be blind.
[01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:17.898]  No.
[01:09:18.259 --> 01:09:18.999]  Would you do it for $100,000?
[01:09:21.078 --> 01:09:22.239]  No, I mean... A million?
[01:09:23.241 --> 01:09:23.441]  No.
[01:09:23.641 --> 01:09:24.021]  Ten million?
[01:09:24.041 --> 01:09:28.266]  There's no need to have... I mean, if I had that money and I didn't have any sight, then I wouldn't be able to enjoy it.
[01:09:28.627 --> 01:09:29.147]  Exactly.
[01:09:29.788 --> 01:09:32.131]  So, eyes are the window to the soul.
[01:09:33.012 --> 01:09:35.635]  What would you give your soul for?
[01:09:35.775 --> 01:09:36.095]  Nothing.
[01:09:36.596 --> 01:09:39.078]  What would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
[01:09:39.699 --> 01:09:42.361]  There is no amount of money the New World Order can give you to sell out to them.
[01:09:42.721 --> 01:09:48.065]  There is no amount of money to get power and control, because you do lose more than just your sight.
[01:09:48.366 --> 01:09:49.266]  You lose your soul.
[01:09:49.546 --> 01:09:53.429]  These people have lost their soul, and then evil is the only thing that's beautiful for them.
[01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:54.490]  Thanks for coming in, bro.
[01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:55.691]  Alright, thanks.
[01:09:55.711 --> 01:09:56.452]  Nice job, you bet.
[01:09:56.752 --> 01:09:59.274]  That's Paul Hartman in here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:00.375 --> 01:10:02.276]  And everybody's at different levels of deprogramming.
[01:10:02.316 --> 01:10:04.398]  He's deprogramming his wife, we're deprogramming him.
[01:10:06.815 --> 01:10:10.436]  I just asked Paul in the behind the scenes for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:10:11.936 --> 01:10:13.837]  He was like joking, saying, how do you become one of these elite?
[01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.097]  And I said, well, you lose your soul.
[01:10:16.397 --> 01:10:17.778]  And then here's the question I asked him.
[01:10:18.498 --> 01:10:23.859]  If I said, Paul, I'll give you $10,000 right now to go down to a clinic and have your eyes removed and give me your eyes.
[01:10:25.079 --> 01:10:26.019]  And I said, would you do it?
[01:10:26.039 --> 01:10:26.499]  He said, no.
[01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:26.859]  I said, $100,000, $1,000,000, $10,000,000.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.360]  He said, no amount of money.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.200]  I couldn't enjoy it.
[01:10:31.921 --> 01:10:33.761]  And I said, what would it profit a man to
[01:10:35.609 --> 01:10:37.190]  Gain the whole world, but lose his soul.
[01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:43.674]  I mean, nothing could... There's no amount of money that you would give up your sight, would you?
[01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.895]  And that's only a window into your soul.
[01:10:45.995 --> 01:10:48.677]  Only one way you interface the world around you.
[01:10:50.638 --> 01:10:53.359]  So, then you understand what it means to truly commit to evil.
[01:10:59.443 --> 01:11:03.045]  Then you understand what it is to commit to the New World Order and go along with all this stuff.
[01:11:04.898 --> 01:11:06.420]  Do not give up who you are.
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:07.461]  Do not give up your identity.
[01:11:07.501 --> 01:11:08.542]  Do not give up your soul.
[01:11:08.582 --> 01:11:11.545]  Do not give up your moral standing.
[01:11:11.565 --> 01:11:13.988]  Do not ever give in to evil.
[01:11:14.328 --> 01:11:15.469]  Because it's a slippery slope.
[01:11:15.589 --> 01:11:17.852]  You've got to stand for something, like Aaron Tippin says.
[01:11:18.332 --> 01:11:20.735]  You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
[01:11:22.301 --> 01:11:24.923]  You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string.
[01:11:24.983 --> 01:11:28.006]  Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name.
[01:11:28.026 --> 01:11:30.668]  You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
[01:11:30.948 --> 01:11:31.989]  You'll lose your sight.
[01:11:32.029 --> 01:11:33.050]  You'll lose your soul.
[01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:34.451]  You'll lose your discernment.
[01:11:34.471 --> 01:11:35.752]  You'll be turned over to evil.
[01:11:36.093 --> 01:11:37.334]  Evil people aren't that smart.
[01:11:37.534 --> 01:11:42.798]  They're just cunning and wicked and working their own little games of corruption and delusion.
[01:11:43.689 --> 01:11:45.530]  I don't want delusion or illusion.
[01:11:45.671 --> 01:11:46.551]  I want reality.
[01:11:47.412 --> 01:11:48.713]  I need your help, too, listeners.
[01:11:48.933 --> 01:11:50.554]  I need to make Fabled Enemies a big movie.
[01:11:51.035 --> 01:11:53.957]  It's a powerful film that needs to be seen and it supports Burmese.
[01:11:54.797 --> 01:12:00.241]  But it needs to be a big film because it's controversial, it's powerful, it exposes who really carried out 9-11, how it was done.
[01:12:00.301 --> 01:12:04.725]  It's available at Infowars.com right now or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:12:04.885 --> 01:12:05.205]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.230]  3-1-3-9.
[01:12:14.771 --> 01:12:19.402]  I'm forgetting which button is the cough button and which button is the video button.
[01:12:21.687 --> 01:12:22.229]  Oh, man!
[01:12:23.183 --> 01:12:32.628]  888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.

[01:12:52.173 --> 01:12:54.496]  Or get the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:12:54.736 --> 01:12:58.361]  And the last bit of help I need from all of you is video.
[01:12:58.461 --> 01:13:00.403]  Kill Michelle Malkin hoax exposed.
[01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:01.424]  Video.
[01:13:01.525 --> 01:13:03.968]  Kill Michelle Malkin hoax exposed.
[01:13:04.048 --> 01:13:07.031]  It's in the featured news area of InfoWars.com.
[01:13:09.477 --> 01:13:12.580]  Aaron stayed up all last night without me asking him to.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.601]  I asked him to make the film.
[01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:14.963]  It's a ten minute piece.
[01:13:15.063 --> 01:13:22.050]  It shows how they set it up, how they provocateured what really happened, who was really violent, who really said kill Michelle Malkin.
[01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:27.795]  They're trying to create this as a story in the legend of who I am that I
[01:13:28.516 --> 01:13:37.219]  Punch her in the face, that I said kill her, that I had guys with me trying to kill her, that I knocked her teeth out and drug her, and I mean it's all over the web.
[01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:42.140]  It's just expanding, that I beat, jumped on a 100 pound woman and was throttling her.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.341]  This is the type of stuff that's being put out.
[01:13:45.737 --> 01:13:48.559]  Really, she said the Marines didn't kill that puppy.
[01:13:48.839 --> 01:13:50.760]  She's 100 times bigger than, I would add.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.021]  But I didn't touch her.
[01:13:52.181 --> 01:13:53.242]  I didn't do anything to her.
[01:13:53.282 --> 01:13:54.002]  I didn't say kill her.
[01:13:54.503 --> 01:14:00.066]  The video exposing the hoax, discrediting them, is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:14:00.106 --> 01:14:01.247]  We've turned the tide against them.
[01:14:01.487 --> 01:14:03.108]  We've gotten a Dallas Morning News retraction.
[01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:04.429]  But that isn't enough.
[01:14:04.889 --> 01:14:08.692]  Please get Michelle Malkin, Hoax Exposed, InfoWars.com.
[01:14:10.333 --> 01:14:12.276]  It's also up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:14:12.376 --> 01:14:15.180]  Please post it on your YouTube page, your MySpace.
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.762]  Please give it to your email list.
[01:14:17.182 --> 01:14:25.474]  Help us expose this creature and her cohorts, her lying little buddies that tried to set me up and get me jailed for saying killer and hitting her.
[01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:30.958]  Incredible first three hours about to retransmit one place on the web.
[01:14:31.579 --> 01:14:34.140]  We'll be right back after this one minute break at InfoWars.com.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.841]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com to hear that stream for all the big guests.
[01:14:36.861 --> 01:14:37.582]  God bless you all.
[01:14:38.102 --> 01:14:39.583]  I had a bunch of people on.
