[00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:09.298]  A 10-day visit to Australia, where he'll continue to heal the wounds caused by the clergy's sexual abuse scandal.
[00:00:09.438 --> 00:00:19.849]  We will help in the education and in the preparation to the priesthood, the permanent formation, and we will do all that's possible to heal and to reconcile to the victims.
[00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.294]  His schedule includes the World Youth Day Festival, which has attracted more than 200,000 people.
[00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.564]  Former President Bill Clinton is toe to Governor's Convention in Philadelphia that despite America's apparent diversity, we're actually hunkering down in communities of like-mindedness.
[00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:45.830]  At the conference, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, who supported Senator Barack Obama, says it was difficult choosing between the two candidates and then making an endorsement in the Democratic Party.
[00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.754]  Everybody who declared, declared feeling some sense of loyalty to at least one of the other candidates and maybe more.
[00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:54.015]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:00:55.387 --> 00:01:03.177]  If you're driving down the road and trying to decide whether you need a home equity loan just to buy gas, you might want to consider starting a home business.
[00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:05.280]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.245]  This is Andy Willoughby with the 3-Step Plan Home Business System.
[00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:13.376]  If you build a home business with the 3-Step Plan, you would walk to work every day.
[00:01:13.697 --> 00:01:18.699]  It would only take about 10 seconds, you wouldn't have to deal with any traffic, and it wouldn't use any gas.
[00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.481]  Of course, some 3-Step Plan members keep their jobs and start a home business part-time.
[00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:25.962]  That's one of the great things about the 3-Step Plan.
[00:01:26.382 --> 00:01:27.783]  You get to make the choices.
[00:01:28.223 --> 00:01:33.825]  For information, go to 3stepplan.com or call 800-480-2102.

[00:01:55.839 --> 00:02:00.303]  The fire near California's Big Sur is about 61% contained.
[00:02:00.323 --> 00:02:07.470]  That's leading officials to reopen Coastal Highway 1 today, three weeks after it was shut down by the massive blaze.
[00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:17.880]  Rain in the forecast may bring more help against the wildfires, but it could create fresh worries about landslides, especially in fire-scarred parts of the state.
[00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.952]  Forecasters say Bertha has weakened to a tropical storm.
[00:02:22.492 --> 00:02:25.654]  Bertha has been hovering over the Atlantic with little movement.
[00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:30.477]  Its outer bands are expected to brush the island of Bermuda in the coming days.
[00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:39.083]  Both presidential candidates will be trying to woo Latino voters this week at a meeting of one of the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights groups.
[00:02:39.864 --> 00:02:46.346]  Barack Obama will likely discuss immigration reform and health care before the National Council of La Raza today.
[00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.927]  John McCain speaks to the group tomorrow.

[00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.011]  Did you know the average household owes over $25,000 in credit card debt?
[00:02:59.331 --> 00:03:01.651]  And 65% of those households can only afford the minimum monthly payment.
[00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:03.371]  Are you in a debt trap you can't get out of?
[00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.412]  I can't keep this up.
[00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:05.292]  I need relief.

[00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:30.149]  Israel and the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas are set to exchange prisoners this week.
[00:03:30.737 --> 00:03:31.558]  Here's Mark Levy.
[00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:38.182]  The exchange will take place Wednesday, according to the Israeli government, two years after Israel and Hezbollah fought a bloody one-month war.
[00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:40.044]  Israel gets back two soldiers.
[00:03:40.364 --> 00:03:41.445]  Israel believes they're dead.
[00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:52.533]  Hezbollah wins release of four of its fighters, plus Samir Kantar, who's been in Israeli prison for nearly 30 years after infiltrating from Lebanon and killing a father, his four-year-old daughter, and a policeman.
[00:03:52.993 --> 00:03:56.916]  Israel also gets information about an Air Force officer captured in Lebanon in 1986.
[00:03:58.385 --> 00:03:59.446]  Mark Levy, Jerusalem.
[00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:04.928]  And White House Press Secretary Tony Snow has died from colon cancer at the age of 53.
[00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:07.249]  Here's Connie Lawn.
[00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.751]  President Bush said Tony was one of our nation's finest writers and commentators.
[00:04:12.112 --> 00:04:16.154]  He earned a loyal following with incisive radio and television broadcasts.
[00:04:16.674 --> 00:04:25.238]  He was a gifted speechwriter who served in my father's administration, and I was thrilled when he agreed to return to the White House to serve as my press secretary.
[00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:29.542]  The President said it was a joy to watch Tony at the podium every day.
[00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:33.264]  He brought wit, grace, and a great love of country to his work.
[00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:45.908]  President Bush also said one of the things that sustained Tony Snow was his faith, and Laura and I joined people across our country in praying that this good man has now found comfort in the arms of his creator.
[00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:49.649]  Hani Lon, IRN USA Radio News, the White House.
[00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.050]  And I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.571]  That's news from the Information Radio Network.
[00:04:55.523 --> 00:05:01.770]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming a third world nation.
[00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:07.156]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health solutions.
[00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:09.098]  Introducing Organ Products.
[00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:14.164]  Organ is the universal life force, the basic building block of all matter on the material planet.
[00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:18.869]  Oregon Electro Medicine is the wave of the future dating back to the late 1800s.
[00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:25.415]  Wilhelm Reich Oregon used cloud buster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic energy savings of up to 25%.
[00:05:26.396 --> 00:05:30.200]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.

[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.723]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:37.408]  All right, my friends, it is Sunday the 13th of July 2008.
[00:06:37.468 --> 00:06:41.551]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:06:42.252 --> 00:06:48.477]  Bob Chapman, who has in the past been the biggest gold and silver broker in the world.
[00:06:48.517 --> 00:06:53.681]  He's also had the largest precious metals and financial newsletter in the world.
[00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:57.104]  He retired, came back, and again has one of the biggest in the world.
[00:06:57.124 --> 00:07:00.326]  He, of course, is also in
[00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:04.626]  Army intelligence before that covered operations.
[00:07:05.147 --> 00:07:20.634]  He, of course, has been predicting a financial complete meltdown and a depression, a hyperinflationary depression in this country, along with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of economics on my show, Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner, former head of the World Bank.
[00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.616]  And, of course, the head of the New York Business School.
[00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:37.361]  These are the type of people, former White House analyst Richard Cook, by the way, let's get Cook back on this week, coming up on the weekday show, and they've all been saying the same thing.
[00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:45.085]  It's all by design to once and for all destroy the liberty and freedom in this country and make us debt channel slaves.
[00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:49.707]  Now, everything we've been talking about, you've heard me for about five, six years, hot and heavy,
[00:07:50.675 --> 00:07:54.959]  Saying, they are devaluing the dollar, they are devaluing the dollar, they are devaluing the dollar.
[00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:58.181]  I mean, I was freaking out when they devalued it 10% in one year.
[00:08:00.043 --> 00:08:03.005]  And now here we are with a devalue of more than 60% globally.
[00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:09.170]  The fellow that owns one of the radio networks that syndicates the weekday show, Ted Anderson, took his fiancé down.
[00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.051]  He's got divorced and remarried.
[00:08:11.492 --> 00:08:15.295]  Took his fiancé down to Argentina.
[00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:18.243]  Down in South America for a week.
[00:08:18.703 --> 00:08:20.244]  But I've been interviewing him while he's been down there.
[00:08:20.664 --> 00:08:23.346]  And they do not want to take dollars in Argentina, folks.
[00:08:23.366 --> 00:08:25.787]  The dollar's always been king.
[00:08:26.688 --> 00:08:28.829]  And now, in Europe, they don't want to take dollars.
[00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:30.029]  I've had family that's been over there.
[00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.812]  Foolish Americans go over to Europe and, you know, it costs eight bucks for a beer.
[00:08:34.852 --> 00:08:37.894]  And they think, oh, the Europeans have really got it bad, these poor schmucks.
[00:08:38.674 --> 00:08:40.555]  I saw a neocon on this website saying that.
[00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:41.596]  They don't understand.
[00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:43.557]  The Europeans aren't paying that in their currencies.
[00:08:44.105 --> 00:08:45.106]  It's the dollars.
[00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:49.192]  It's like if you have pesos in the past and tried to come up here and buy things.
[00:08:49.852 --> 00:08:54.578]  And if Americans could realize that the elites were devaluing our currency by design.
[00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:56.241]  We have the IMF World Bank documents.
[00:08:56.874 --> 00:09:01.617]  From March of 2002 that leaked with Joseph Stiklitz's departure from the World Bank.
[00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:03.178]  We could have stopped all this.
[00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:14.405]  That's why every show, I warn you, I beg you, I plead, and I even walk up to reporters I know on TV and radio and they just say, Alex, the dollar's not devalued, we're not going to report that.
[00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:19.928]  And I can hand them a stack of foreign, you know, Reuters, French News Agency,
[00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:24.004]  Financial Times and they just say, nope, that's not what's going on.
[00:09:24.465 --> 00:09:27.927]  There's been a problem with some mortgages and that's why.
[00:09:28.107 --> 00:09:36.513]  And so, okay, hey, you want to let them totally destroy your financial future, then I'm going to get out of your way and just have, just enjoy yourselves.
[00:09:37.514 --> 00:09:41.517]  I mean, the people of this country are willfully ignorant.
[00:09:42.297 --> 00:09:46.140]  You will hear nowhere on our media that they are devaluing the dollar.
[00:09:48.717 --> 00:09:58.182]  If I hear one more time that we are paying $4.20 on average for a gallon of 87 octane unleaded, I'm going to scream.
[00:09:58.562 --> 00:09:59.502]  But I know I'm going to hear it.
[00:09:59.963 --> 00:10:00.643]  It's all I hear.
[00:10:01.903 --> 00:10:03.284]  It is not the speculation.
[00:10:03.424 --> 00:10:08.787]  It is that the dollar is imploding 70 plus percent of the cost increase.
[00:10:09.287 --> 00:10:12.409]  Remember it doubled five years ago and then it quadrupled.
[00:10:12.469 --> 00:10:15.130]  It's quadrupled in prices in five years.
[00:10:16.124 --> 00:10:19.167]  They're talking about another doubling by next summer.
[00:10:19.748 --> 00:10:26.756]  And if they attack Iran, you can forget a year from now, you're going to be paying $8 a gallon within a month of that attack taking place.
[00:10:27.357 --> 00:10:32.142]  So, let's go ahead and just go over some of what's happening right now.
[00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:36.066]  Run-on bank spells big trouble for U.S.
[00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:36.527]  Treasury.
[00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:52.341]  Now, I've got the Financial Times of London, I've got the City Morning Herald, I've got Reuters, I've got a French news agency, all saying, and it's press releases from the Treasury Department, saying, please don't stop AAA rating our government bonds.
[00:10:53.342 --> 00:10:59.647]  Folks, third world countries get AAA rating on their bonds, and the world is now considering
[00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:02.696]  Completely dumping the dollar in U.S.
[00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:03.277]  securities.
[00:11:03.357 --> 00:11:07.439]  And then, ladies and gentlemen, it will mean Road Warrior Death Race 2000.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.180]  Okay?
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.564]  I mean, if that happens, it will make 1929 Germany look like Valhalla.
[00:11:15.724 --> 00:11:17.966]  Heaven compared to what is going to happen.
[00:11:18.426 --> 00:11:23.689]  Now, if we don't politically address what's happening, the bankers will rape us to the wall.
[00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.550]  They will gut you.
[00:11:25.631 --> 00:11:26.411]  Forget shearing you.
[00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:27.912]  Sheep just get sheared.
[00:11:28.482 --> 00:11:29.022]  Doesn't hurt them.
[00:11:29.483 --> 00:11:29.943]  In the summer.
[00:11:30.443 --> 00:11:31.124]  But they don't like it.
[00:11:31.404 --> 00:11:32.885]  You're being gutted, okay?
[00:11:32.905 --> 00:11:33.665]  You're not being sheared.
[00:11:33.685 --> 00:11:38.288]  You're being strung up like a pig by your hind legs, having your throat slit, and you're being cut up for bacon.
[00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:45.632]  There is one publication out of hundreds, and I have read hundreds since this happened Friday afternoon.
[00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:46.613]  Hundreds!
[00:11:46.653 --> 00:11:49.815]  I've spent three or four hours every day studying this.
[00:11:49.955 --> 00:11:50.796]  Only one U.S.
[00:11:51.296 --> 00:11:52.897]  publication told the truth.
[00:11:52.997 --> 00:11:54.578]  It is the Los Angeles Times.
[00:11:55.134 --> 00:12:00.177]  As much as I hate these gun-grabbing, open-border-loving socialists, they occasionally will tell the truth.
[00:12:00.797 --> 00:12:06.440]  And it says here, when faith is frayed, and then it just gets into foreign governments are considering dumping the dollar.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:16.885]  And it says, this flare up in the financial forest fire that is far beyond anything we've seen before, said Christopher Lowe, chief financial investment firm, FTN Financial in New York.
[00:12:17.206 --> 00:12:20.047]  See, I mean, all the analysts are saying this, this is not allowed to be in our media.
[00:12:20.307 --> 00:12:21.908]  You can't tell the cattle what's going on.
[00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.454]  They might actually stampede and stop what's happening.
[00:12:24.914 --> 00:12:30.560]  And it is triggering worries that would have been unthinkable even a year ago, including the U.S.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:37.126]  Treasury debt might lose its AAA credit grade because of heavy blows to the nation's financial health from the housing mess.
[00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:39.288]  So, one U.S.
[00:12:39.328 --> 00:12:47.076]  publication, one, one, one, will just give you a little window into what we face.
[00:12:48.618 --> 00:12:56.823]  And I don't want to hear from all the cheerleaders out there that, well, Alex, we've just got to say everything's fine, because if we come out and say it isn't fine, confidence will be lost.
[00:12:57.503 --> 00:12:58.924]  This is a global system.
[00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:01.506]  Confidence has been lost, bozos.
[00:13:02.086 --> 00:13:04.708]  We have to have the government raise interest rates now.
[00:13:04.988 --> 00:13:07.309]  We have to say strong dollar policy now.
[00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.351]  We have to start tariffs now.
[00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:14.634]  And of course, they will then try to blame that, like they did with the smooth haulings thing,
[00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:19.928]  You know, as we were already going in, it took 6 months and 29 for the real depression to kick off.
[00:13:20.509 --> 00:13:23.951]  And the stock market went up and down like it is now, and there was a liquidity crisis.
[00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:29.035]  And then they put up the tariffs too late, and then tried to blame it on that, when it had nothing to do with it.
[00:13:29.695 --> 00:13:33.818]  So actually, I don't want having tariffs when we go into depression being blamed.
[00:13:33.858 --> 00:13:37.501]  So let's not do that, so the yuppies can't say tariffs did it.
[00:13:38.482 --> 00:13:38.702]  Again,
[00:13:39.628 --> 00:13:46.870]  People will invest here if they know we're not going to be financially strip-mined and we're going to build industry and have a future and not just have a fiat currency.
[00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:50.151]  That's all the country has left is a fiat currency.
[00:13:51.652 --> 00:13:53.433]  That's all we had left financially.
[00:13:55.193 --> 00:13:56.233]  And let me tell you something, folks.
[00:13:56.273 --> 00:13:58.714]  The government is going to tax you at 80-something percent.
[00:13:58.754 --> 00:13:59.595]  They're already saying it.
[00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:00.815]  The OECD is saying it.
[00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:05.448]  Doesn't matter what party comes in, you're not going to like what's about to happen.
[00:14:05.508 --> 00:14:09.570]  You better, politically, tell them now, we're not going to pay back these debts.
[00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:16.933]  Because these debts are owed to central banks that are private, that created these currencies and liquidity out of nothing.
[00:14:17.393 --> 00:14:19.193]  It is a monumental fraud.
[00:14:20.294 --> 00:14:25.856]  And they literally, the globalists, on our credit and our name, bought the infrastructure of the world.
[00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:28.537]  They're all in secure assets and commodities.
[00:14:29.907 --> 00:14:31.809]  Okay, now everybody else is headed to the door.
[00:14:32.129 --> 00:14:34.010]  There's tens of trillions in U.S.
[00:14:34.491 --> 00:14:36.432]  notes, greenbacks, and securities out there.
[00:14:36.673 --> 00:14:42.737]  They're all dumping them as fast as they can into commodities, and that's the 25% increase you've seen in oil.
[00:14:43.218 --> 00:14:45.159]  That's the doubling you've seen in gold.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:59.131]  That's why corn and grain... I mean, there's other factors that feed in, but the main reason that you're seeing commodities explode in price is that people are looking for safe havens to dump their dollars.
[00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:02.149]  And the big money even writes about this.
[00:15:02.209 --> 00:15:09.634]  I saw this a year ago in the Financial Times of London when the countrywide stuff and the Northern Rock and all this was just starting, actually about 10 months ago.
[00:15:09.994 --> 00:15:17.439]  And they said, we just better hope that institutional money and the wealthy, that means billionaires, can position our money
[00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:24.441]  Where it isn't lost because this implosion is so big it threatens to even bankrupt the elite.
[00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:37.864]  They so greedily raped us to the wall because we are mindless chump smucks in this country that their greed has created an implosion black hole financially that threatens to even suck their greedy butts in.
[00:15:38.624 --> 00:15:40.706]  I will talk to Bob Chapman and a lot more straight ahead.
[00:15:40.726 --> 00:15:42.227]  We'll get into Iran war news.
[00:15:42.287 --> 00:15:44.729]  Bush says he's green light for go, go, go!
[00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:50.513]  And boy, you'd better get ready for total implosion then, and I know you'll love it, because we're schmucks, born to be raped!
[00:15:55.817 --> 00:15:56.418]  Question.
[00:15:56.638 --> 00:15:59.980]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[00:16:01.301 --> 00:16:04.644]  The world economic collapse could come any day.
[00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:10.282]  Question, are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[00:16:11.964 --> 00:16:16.310]  Question, do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[00:17:31.776 --> 00:17:44.328]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:48.251]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[00:17:48.491 --> 00:17:52.495]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them dot com.
[00:17:52.795 --> 00:17:54.057]  The message of his kingdom.
[00:17:55.703 --> 00:17:56.143]  Attention!
[00:17:56.223 --> 00:17:58.384]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:17:58.684 --> 00:18:00.745]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:18:00.966 --> 00:18:03.487]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:18:03.947 --> 00:18:08.329]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:09.210]  Here's why.
[00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:15.853]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:18:16.133 --> 00:18:22.616]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:18:22.836 --> 00:18:26.578]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:31.201]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:18:31.661 --> 00:18:38.825]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.666]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!
[00:18:41.966 --> 00:18:42.987]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[00:18:43.007 --> 00:18:43.927]  That's www.outand90.com.
[00:18:44.047 --> 00:18:44.527]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:44.988]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:18:55.612 --> 00:18:56.272]  It's a fact.
[00:18:56.493 --> 00:19:03.957]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:19:04.077 --> 00:19:12.942]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:19:13.222 --> 00:19:23.768]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:19:24.028 --> 00:19:30.071]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:35.314]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:19:35.494 --> 00:19:39.977]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:41.958]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:19:41.998 --> 00:19:42.278]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:19:42.298 --> 00:19:42.778]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:44.619]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:19:51.903 --> 00:19:54.866]  Visit fdrs.org today.
[00:19:54.886 --> 00:19:57.889]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.493]  Visit gcnlive.com today.
[00:20:18.346 --> 00:20:26.791]  Israeli airplanes have been confirmed by the Israeli Air Force to be stationed in Massing in Iraq for strikes on Iran.
[00:20:28.232 --> 00:20:36.297]  OPEC says that oil will go to unlimited prices, conservatively $500 a barrel if there is attack.
[00:20:36.317 --> 00:20:39.899]  That means you'll be paying close to $20 a gallon, according to them.
[00:20:41.013 --> 00:20:45.136]  The economy, which is completely based on petrochemicals, will completely implode.
[00:20:45.636 --> 00:20:50.160]  But they've got their New World Order shock troops, FEMA camps built.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.502]  The real target of all of this is the United States.
[00:20:54.203 --> 00:21:03.930]  The New World Order wants to launch an attack on defenseless Iran, so they can then claim Iran is launching terror attacks inside the U.S., which will actually be launched by the Pentagon.
[00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:07.872]  The true target is the American people and setting up a police state.
[00:21:07.952 --> 00:21:09.193]  Congress and the Homeland Security
[00:21:10.494 --> 00:21:14.617]  Committee in the House have discovered the Marshall Law plans for six months.
[00:21:14.657 --> 00:21:16.338]  I've interviewed multiple members of Congress.
[00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:21.741]  We have articles up there today where they're now trying to subpoena the White House about the Marshall Law plans.
[00:21:22.822 --> 00:21:27.325]  Karl Rove also was subpoenaed by Congress and fled the country and is now under indictment.
[00:21:27.665 --> 00:21:35.770]  You will never hear that on your national news though, but if you Google it, it's all over the foreign press and there's videos on YouTube of Congress.
[00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.030]  And the indictments.
[00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:43.691]  Of course, that doesn't really matter because Barack Obama and John McCain are totally owned by the New World Order as well.
[00:21:45.152 --> 00:21:47.372]  Run on Banks Spells Big Trouble for U.S.
[00:21:48.092 --> 00:21:55.634]  Largest bank run since the Great Depression in the early 1930s here in the United States, kicking off in 1929.
[00:21:55.894 --> 00:21:58.234]  That is the mainstream headlines.
[00:21:58.334 --> 00:21:58.574]  U.S.
[00:21:58.634 --> 00:22:01.775]  Bank IndyMax Seized Amid Intensifying Crisis.
[00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:05.556]  Seventy-five percent of the value has been lost the last six months.
[00:22:05.596 --> 00:22:09.578]  Fifty percent of that loss was just Friday of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[00:22:09.658 --> 00:22:12.000]  Total money laundering scams themselves.
[00:22:13.321 --> 00:22:16.042]  Oil now above 150 a barrel in weekend trading.
[00:22:16.122 --> 00:22:18.364]  Gold exploding for the rest of the hour.
[00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:20.045]  We're joined by former Army intelligence.
[00:22:20.565 --> 00:22:23.067]  He of course lived all over the world from France to South Africa.
[00:22:23.407 --> 00:22:26.129]  The largest gold and silver broker in the world at one time.
[00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:29.711]  He owned all the big newsletters including the
[00:22:30.666 --> 00:22:37.111]  Well, there's just so many of them, but the Gary Allen Report and so many others, and he's Bob Chapman, been forecasting all this.
[00:22:37.511 --> 00:22:39.833]  His website's TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:46.918]  Bob, you've been forecasting total depression, along with Joseph Stickels and others, a hyper-inflationary depression within two and a half years.
[00:22:47.319 --> 00:22:48.519]  Are you revising that?
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.262]  Are things accelerating and deteriorating faster?
[00:22:51.282 --> 00:22:57.306]  I mean, you said we could... I mean, it could blow a gasket any day, but you said, sure thing, within three years.
[00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:58.247]  What do you say now?
[00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:01.003]  No, I think it's about the same.
[00:23:01.804 --> 00:23:08.092]  And the reason I say that is that these are deflecting events that are happening.
[00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:14.220]  We're talking about the amassing of Israeli jets in Iraq for an attack.
[00:23:15.307 --> 00:23:28.035]  They want an attack on Iran for a number of reasons, but one of them is the same kind of reason that they invaded Iraq and Afghanistan in the first place, is to get everybody thinking about what's going on over there and not what's going on over here.
[00:23:28.855 --> 00:23:34.499]  And of course, as you said, in order to control the American people and to enslave them.
[00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:37.140]  And that's what really this is all about.
[00:23:37.201 --> 00:23:38.801]  And you are right about that.
[00:23:39.542 --> 00:23:42.384]  And this whole economic event
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:43.680]  I think?
[00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:06.778]  And the continuum for them has turned into a route for them.
[00:24:07.138 --> 00:24:10.600]  They are in serious trouble because as you said earlier in your initial dissertation that the
[00:24:22.517 --> 00:24:30.125]  The economic and financial collapse that we're facing could very well bring them down as well, the richest and the most powerful.
[00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:32.087]  And I think you're right about that.
[00:24:32.588 --> 00:24:42.198]  And I think they're absolutely terrified because once that happens, these indictments and subpoenas and grand juries and
[00:24:43.709 --> 00:24:50.171]  They're bringing forth of trials for these people are going to denude them of their wealth and power.
[00:24:50.831 --> 00:24:52.251]  And I think that's the way it's headed.
[00:24:52.671 --> 00:25:01.734]  And quite frankly, even though it's going to be a dreadful thing to contemplate and to face individually and as groups throughout the world in different countries,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:10.743]  It's a good thing that the whole thing's coming down because finally it can be exposed and we can show the people what they haven't been listening to.
[00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:14.384]  And maybe it won't happen again for a long time.
[00:25:14.884 --> 00:25:16.504]  And we'll dig our way out of it.
[00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:18.025]  It's just going to be very difficult.
[00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:22.940]  Now, the Los Angeles Times is the only U.S.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:34.225]  publication, of course, as you know, all the foreign are admitting the truth, that foreign governments and others are considering, including IMF and World Bank, no longer giving our treasury bonds a AAA rating.
[00:25:35.025 --> 00:25:36.465]  A, do you think that's going to happen?
[00:25:36.485 --> 00:25:40.147]  And B, what will that precipitate?
[00:25:41.527 --> 00:25:45.789]  Well, first of all, the chances of it happening are not great.
[00:25:46.834 --> 00:25:48.915]  These ghouls are in this thing together.
[00:25:49.575 --> 00:25:57.679]  Now, the only thing that could cause that would be a real hard and fast split between the European and the U.S.
[00:25:57.819 --> 00:25:59.340]  interests behind the scenes.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.120]  And that could develop.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:14.126]  They're very, very disturbed with getting bagged with 40% of the losses that occurred in subprime and also loans and other loans as well in the real estate region, we'll call it.
[00:26:14.898 --> 00:26:17.381]  And so, maybe they are going to split.
[00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:19.543]  They've shown some signs of that.
[00:26:20.063 --> 00:26:25.468]  And the BIS letter that was put out last week alluded to that.
[00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:30.353]  And that's probably, in fact, what you're talking about or reflecting on.
[00:26:30.413 --> 00:26:31.054]  Yes, yes.
[00:26:31.114 --> 00:26:32.495]  The Bank of International Settlements.
[00:26:32.535 --> 00:26:35.298]  But remember, Bob, for the laymen out there, they listen to these fake
[00:26:36.098 --> 00:26:37.779]  Well, first of all, it can't be averted.
[00:26:37.819 --> 00:26:38.879]  There's just no way that can happen.
[00:27:04.452 --> 00:27:06.253]  It's now the degree of the pain.
[00:27:07.153 --> 00:27:09.014]  And what is the solution?
[00:27:09.054 --> 00:27:09.775]  It's pretty simple.
[00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:11.175]  You purge the system.
[00:27:11.575 --> 00:27:15.877]  You raise interest rates and you stop creating enormous amounts of money and credit.
[00:27:16.438 --> 00:27:22.680]  And banks and insurance companies and corporations and individuals are going to fail.
[00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:24.481]  And you're going to have unemployment at 35%.
[00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:26.622]  Well, you're going to get it there anyway.
[00:27:27.643 --> 00:27:29.524]  So, there's no way out of this thing.
[00:27:29.864 --> 00:27:31.524]  This is classical economics.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.261]  That is the solution.
[00:27:34.701 --> 00:27:35.101]  Purging.
[00:27:35.842 --> 00:27:37.903]  And we all gotta go through it whether we like it or not.
[00:27:37.983 --> 00:27:43.367]  And if we don't purge, I mean explain to people, if we don't purge, and all the top experts agree by the way, you'll just never hear them on U.S.
[00:27:43.407 --> 00:27:45.988]  media, if we don't purge it's ten times worse, isn't it?
[00:27:47.089 --> 00:27:51.532]  Absolutely, because you see Japan in 1992, they didn't purge.
[00:27:51.892 --> 00:27:55.835]  They went on and on and on and had a depression up until now.
[00:27:56.761 --> 00:28:05.608]  I mean the stocks fell 70 percent, land fell 80 percent, homes fell 75 percent, and they still haven't recovered.
[00:28:06.008 --> 00:28:10.111]  They did wipe out a 1.2 trillion dollar debt, they're down to a couple of hundred billion.
[00:28:10.632 --> 00:28:13.134]  But still, they didn't take the medicine.
[00:28:13.214 --> 00:28:13.514]  Why?
[00:28:13.834 --> 00:28:15.976]  Because the Fed told them not to.
[00:28:16.216 --> 00:28:17.577]  So we've got a reboot now.
[00:28:17.637 --> 00:28:18.838]  We've got to reboot the system.
[00:28:19.158 --> 00:28:22.581]  We'll come back, talk about what you would do, Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:28:23.061 --> 00:28:23.822]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:28:23.842 --> 00:28:25.063]  I know we've got a lot of callers.

[00:28:55.365 --> 00:28:55.645]  Fact.
[00:28:55.825 --> 00:29:01.728]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:29:01.848 --> 00:29:06.090]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:13.633]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:29:13.853 --> 00:29:14.473]  The solution.

[00:31:55.754 --> 00:31:57.595]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:57.715 --> 00:32:04.419]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:12.864]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:13.084 --> 00:32:18.808]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:18.988 --> 00:32:20.770]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.993]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:32:23.013 --> 00:32:27.378]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:32:27.539 --> 00:32:29.661]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:32:29.761 --> 00:32:37.531]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:32:37.611 --> 00:32:41.073]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:33:12.728 --> 00:33:14.669]  We have a criminal government.
[00:33:15.489 --> 00:33:18.650]  It's run by cocaine and heroin dealers, literally.
[00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.071]  They launder the money to the banks.
[00:33:21.691 --> 00:33:30.934]  They made the decision, arrogantly, to issue unlimited liquidity to themselves and everybody else, and to buy up all the infrastructure.
[00:33:31.514 --> 00:33:33.495]  They've leveraged the world thousands of times.
[00:33:33.875 --> 00:33:37.456]  That is, there's thousands of times of fiat money compared to real assets.
[00:33:38.837 --> 00:33:48.494]  And they wrote IMF World Bank documents, White House memos, about how they set us up in a police state, this happened decades ago, so that when the people found out, we couldn't punish them for their criminal actions.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:51.599]  Because we are going to be left holding the financial bag.
[00:33:52.605 --> 00:34:04.575]  The OECD and others, the big global management groups, are saying that we are going to have to pay 87% taxes just to pay off the debt on this so they can then own all the real assets.
[00:34:04.596 --> 00:34:10.901]  But as Bob Chapman was saying, top expert on the stock market, the commodities, you name it, the internationalforecaster.com.
[00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:13.223]  I went through his bio, it would take hours, but you can go read it if you want.
[00:34:13.784 --> 00:34:19.929]  And we're honored to have guests of his caliber, and people like the father of economics, former head of the Treasury, Paul Craig Roberts, and others.
[00:34:20.282 --> 00:34:21.543]  They're all saying the same thing.
[00:34:21.603 --> 00:34:22.623]  We are cooked.
[00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:26.284]  Unless we raise interest rates and do some other things.
[00:34:26.525 --> 00:34:29.546]  What could lessen the crash landing, Bob Chapman?
[00:34:29.566 --> 00:34:32.547]  I want to go back into what we're seeing happen right now.
[00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:40.490]  Well, I think probably a slow upward movement in interest rates.
[00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.291]  And that wouldn't have to come
[00:34:43.538 --> 00:34:44.639]  From the Fed Reserve.
[00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:46.640]  It could come by the market itself.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.121]  And it really is underway.
[00:34:49.201 --> 00:34:50.201]  It's already started.
[00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:51.462]  Well, that's what Europe's doing, right?
[00:34:52.302 --> 00:34:52.582]  Right.
[00:34:52.802 --> 00:34:57.625]  And I think that you're going to see more of this in the real marketplace.
[00:34:58.645 --> 00:35:02.407]  And sooner or later, the Fed will have to raise rates.
[00:35:02.427 --> 00:35:04.068]  But it's not going to be any time soon.
[00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:07.169]  They sent out that false signal.
[00:35:07.659 --> 00:35:11.622]  Well, a couple of months ago, in order to keep the stock market up.
[00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:29.294]  But I kind of think that except for expeditionary moves into the market, I think they've come to terms with the fact that the stock market's going down and they can't do an awful lot to stop it.
[00:35:29.674 --> 00:35:32.256]  And I think they're at the same crossroads with gold and silver.
[00:35:35.126 --> 00:35:37.687]  This is all part of a crumbling process.
[00:35:38.127 --> 00:35:39.867]  This whole thing is coming unglued.
[00:35:40.327 --> 00:35:46.028]  It's just like Fortis, the banking group in Europe said, you know, the 6,000 banks, you know, how many are going under?
[00:35:46.648 --> 00:35:51.809]  And I had projected 300 in the next couple of years, but maybe it's super conservative.
[00:35:51.869 --> 00:35:56.170]  I mean, we won't know until we get there, but it's not going to be good.
[00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.051]  And of course, we just had IndyMac go down.
[00:35:59.671 --> 00:36:01.291]  It should have gone down eight months ago.
[00:36:02.072 --> 00:36:03.992]  They were keeping alive on
[00:36:04.815 --> 00:36:06.096]  Whole blood or something.
[00:36:07.777 --> 00:36:08.897]  And so that's gone now.
[00:36:09.297 --> 00:36:14.660]  And hopefully people didn't have more than $100,000 in their accounts because otherwise they'd be stuck.
[00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:28.768]  But we are just continuing to evolve in a system that is continuing to be floated by the amount of money and credit that the Fed
[00:36:29.488 --> 00:36:29.928]  Yes, we are.
[00:36:50.265 --> 00:36:50.685]  We're good to go.
[00:37:11.921 --> 00:37:14.002]  And the dollar has dropped again.
[00:37:14.203 --> 00:37:16.224]  Oil has risen with that.
[00:37:16.724 --> 00:37:23.489]  Can you speak to what that means and what more failing banks and more Federal Reserve bailouts mean?
[00:37:23.529 --> 00:37:26.030]  That is, private banks get bailed out with our tax money.
[00:37:27.972 --> 00:37:38.518]  And the brokerage business and the investment business and the insurance business and eventually the corporate business because that's what happens in a corporate as fascist state and that's what we've got.
[00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:39.419]  But
[00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:41.471]  The Fed's in a box.
[00:37:41.991 --> 00:37:44.232]  If they raise interest rates, the economy collapses.
[00:37:44.672 --> 00:37:46.072]  So they really can't do anything.
[00:37:46.913 --> 00:37:51.594]  Now, that's why I said it'll be a couple of years before they're going to raise interest rates.
[00:37:51.714 --> 00:37:57.895]  Everybody else will, and the real market for interest rates will rise, but their official position won't.
[00:37:58.215 --> 00:37:59.515]  Why are they buying time?
[00:37:59.555 --> 00:38:00.936]  I mean, why?
[00:38:00.956 --> 00:38:03.916]  Because they don't want to be caught at what they're doing.
[00:38:04.817 --> 00:38:06.777]  They want to pass it on to Barack Obama.
[00:38:08.871 --> 00:38:09.211]  Pardon me?
[00:38:09.251 --> 00:38:11.053]  They want to pass it on to other administrations.
[00:38:11.994 --> 00:38:13.875]  Well, yeah, that's true in part.
[00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:19.039]  And, you know, George W. Bush gets out with his proverbial skin.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:24.644]  With his rating now, I don't know that it's going to make much difference.
[00:38:24.684 --> 00:38:29.028]  I think it's lower now than Richard Nixon's was after he resigned.
[00:38:29.088 --> 00:38:37.775]  But the problem is one that they're trying to extend.
[00:38:38.676 --> 00:38:45.998]  And in that extension, they're making the problem worse, but they don't know what to do because they're caught.
[00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:50.199]  Now, you referred to how this is happening.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.340]  The diminution of assets.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:59.042]  We have homes, commercial real estate, businesses falling in value.
[00:39:00.262 --> 00:39:05.904]  We have mortgages and other such lent instruments
[00:39:06.778 --> 00:39:08.839]  Such as credit cards and so on and so forth.
[00:39:10.399 --> 00:39:12.560]  The failure rate continues to rise.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.040]  Those are all loss of assets.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:20.942]  And we're having diminishing assets while the dollar is devalued and inflation, what is running about 14% a year?
[00:39:22.262 --> 00:39:26.663]  My figure is at 12.875 right now, just under 13.
[00:39:27.344 --> 00:39:29.324]  I expect 15 by the end of the year.
[00:39:30.024 --> 00:39:36.026]  And I think that the M3, which is the issuance of money and credit in one way or another by the Fed,
[00:39:36.784 --> 00:39:39.727]  I think that it's around 17% right now.
[00:39:40.287 --> 00:39:42.689]  It fluctuates every couple of weeks.
[00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:51.377]  And I see that over 20% next year, maybe as high as 25 or 30, to keep the engine going.
[00:39:51.437 --> 00:40:04.468]  Now let's be clear, they're going to devalue the dollar outside the country by 25 to 30%, while 15%, but that's compounded annually, so we've already lost half the dollar's value at conservative 10% loss per year in the last five.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.262]  Well, I think ultimately we'll lose 50% of the value from here.
[00:40:10.163 --> 00:40:15.566]  And that's because the issuance of money and credit will grow that great before the system collapses.
[00:40:15.626 --> 00:40:23.291]  Okay, putting this in layman's terms, if they raise interest rates, put in tariffs, as Dr. Roberts has called for, I want to see if you agree with that.
[00:40:24.051 --> 00:40:24.711]  I sure do.
[00:40:25.232 --> 00:40:26.072]  Okay.
[00:40:26.252 --> 00:40:30.475]  I didn't know anybody else had the guts to get out front on that.
[00:40:30.495 --> 00:40:35.298]  I've been the only one for the last five or six years, and I'm happy to hear he is because
[00:40:36.198 --> 00:40:38.419]  Tariffs made America great.
[00:40:38.459 --> 00:40:48.023]  We went through a very difficult time after the Declaration of Independence in trade because we had a free and open mercantilist economy.
[00:40:48.803 --> 00:40:57.207]  And what happened was that it was a disaster because the Chinese were making things cheaper than that they could ship to us than they are now.
[00:40:57.907 --> 00:41:02.269]  And so we went to tariffs and the tariffs were fair and everybody else used tariffs.
[00:41:02.925 --> 00:41:19.510]  And it was a level playing field in as much as you produce the broom in China for 50 cents and it was produced in the United States for a dollar, so the tariff on brooms from China was 50 cents.
[00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:20.570]  It's pretty simple.
[00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.950]  And then you can decide what you want.
[00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:23.611]  That's right.
[00:41:23.631 --> 00:41:30.633]  They would compete on the value of the product itself.
[00:41:30.673 --> 00:41:31.873]  And then that ups quality.
[00:41:33.907 --> 00:41:34.367]  Quality.
[00:41:34.548 --> 00:41:35.388]  Instead of the global system.
[00:41:35.408 --> 00:41:37.729]  China didn't have quality in those days, believe me.
[00:41:37.749 --> 00:41:38.470]  Neither did Japan.
[00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:38.830]  Yeah.
[00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.372]  And so, that though, incentivizes quality.
[00:41:42.752 --> 00:41:51.316]  Now, again, Bob Chapman, for laymen out there that don't understand, they are going to continue to devalue the dollar and keep interest rates where they are for a while longer.
[00:41:51.636 --> 00:42:02.422]  That will ensure destruction of the dollar and the economy instead of saving the dollar and letting the economy fall apart to where we at least still had some value in our fiat currency, correct?
[00:42:03.135 --> 00:42:04.296]  Which they should be doing.
[00:42:05.156 --> 00:42:18.302]  And the only answer, as an antidote for that, is an insurance policy and food filters, things to defend your family with, and gold and silver.
[00:42:18.322 --> 00:42:19.923]  That's the only place to go to.
[00:42:20.083 --> 00:42:24.425]  Now, when we come back, we're going to take some calls for you, Bob Chapman, but I want to ask you a question.
[00:42:25.105 --> 00:42:27.606]  This is gyrating out of control, even they're losing control of it.
[00:42:30.027 --> 00:42:35.809]  In a lot of their writings, they say they wanted to kill the dollar to bring in the world currency, but is this happening too soon?
[00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:38.650]  We'll talk to Bob Chapman on the other side.
[00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.232]  The New World Order engineered this to rape you, okay?
[00:42:42.252 --> 00:42:47.494]  But in the process, they've even endangered their own ghoulish butts, as Bob Chapman was just saying.
[00:42:47.774 --> 00:42:48.774]  Bob Chapman's our guest.
[00:42:48.814 --> 00:42:50.315]  Your call's straight ahead.
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.622]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[00:42:58.882 --> 00:43:00.903]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[00:43:01.203 --> 00:43:04.545]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[00:43:04.825 --> 00:43:05.505]  Be smart.
[00:43:05.766 --> 00:43:06.466]  Be safe.
[00:43:06.746 --> 00:43:08.707]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:00.161]  You've been there.
[00:44:00.701 --> 00:44:03.183]  Have a few drinks and you wake up feeling a bit fuzzy.
[00:44:04.224 --> 00:44:06.085]  So keep your body in tune.

[00:44:30.778 --> 00:44:34.000]  People in Asia have used guava for centuries to keep the body healthy.

[00:44:55.775 --> 00:45:01.438]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:06.481]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:45:06.501 --> 00:45:11.704]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:45:11.924 --> 00:45:15.306]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.

[00:45:30.152 --> 00:45:35.894]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[00:45:36.134 --> 00:45:41.176]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.
[00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:44.357]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now.
[00:45:44.537 --> 00:45:44.818]  We're good.
[00:45:55.501 --> 00:45:59.762]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:46:00.003 --> 00:46:04.904]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:46:05.104 --> 00:46:06.485]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:46:06.625 --> 00:46:10.106]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:46:57.144 --> 00:47:00.525]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:47:00.545 --> 00:47:03.686]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:47:09.788 --> 00:47:13.068]  Tomorrow on the weekday show, I'm going to have Bob on longer than 45 minutes.
[00:47:13.108 --> 00:47:15.249]  We'll take a few of your calls for him here in just a moment.
[00:47:15.914 --> 00:47:18.595]  Got Jordan Maxwell for an hour coming up next.
[00:47:18.655 --> 00:47:21.377]  Talk about who the guys are that run this whole thing.
[00:47:21.957 --> 00:47:23.397]  The whole esoteric agenda.
[00:47:25.018 --> 00:47:26.259]  Had him scheduled weeks ago.
[00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:39.625]  Bob, there's so much to cover, but... I mean, you and all the other experts I've talked to keep saying it's gonna really get bad in the next few years.
[00:47:39.665 --> 00:47:40.845]  But things are already bad.
[00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.186]  They're getting worse.
[00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:44.647]  People are finally starting to see the inflation on the ground.
[00:47:45.171 --> 00:47:46.352]  Not just overseas.
[00:47:48.754 --> 00:47:50.095]  How do you see this playing out?
[00:47:50.235 --> 00:47:52.097]  And then also, who do we blame?
[00:47:52.117 --> 00:48:03.065]  I mean, we know it's the globalist engineering, we have our own plans, but we need to get this out to the public now so that the people that have engineered this in the establishment don't pose as the saviors again.
[00:48:03.325 --> 00:48:10.571]  We already have the private Federal Reserve wanting a global government, wanting global carbon taxes as their next Ponzi scheme to get control of us.
[00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:11.512]  Break that down.
[00:48:12.918 --> 00:48:19.082]  Well, I think the main cog, and I'm sure Craig Robbins will agree with me, is doing away with the Federal Reserve.
[00:48:19.923 --> 00:48:21.604]  And that would be a good start.
[00:48:21.744 --> 00:48:30.710]  And we can take the people who belong to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the known Bilderbergers, and start running investigations on them.
[00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:37.534]  And at the same time, also go after the people who have been in the last two administrations
[00:48:38.232 --> 00:48:45.735]  Uh, not only, uh, in the Treasury Department, but also in Justice, and in the Pentagon, and start tearing apart what they've done.
[00:48:46.255 --> 00:48:48.036]  And then start bringing criminal charges.
[00:48:48.516 --> 00:48:52.918]  I mean, this is the best way to solve the problem, to get rid of these people once and for all.
[00:48:52.938 --> 00:48:53.818]  And this is criminal!
[00:48:53.838 --> 00:48:54.899]  They have looted us!
[00:48:55.179 --> 00:48:59.121]  Can you explain to the laymen out there how we've been systematically looted?
[00:49:00.861 --> 00:49:02.282]  Well, they control everything.
[00:49:02.982 --> 00:49:07.024]  And the only people who make big money are the ones who are in control.
[00:49:07.868 --> 00:49:15.491]  And they do what they want to do, as you've seen the administration and Congress blatantly just move around the law.
[00:49:16.151 --> 00:49:18.852]  They defy the Constitution.
[00:49:19.012 --> 00:49:25.195]  You saw the FISA, which was passed last week, which is blatantly unconstitutional.
[00:49:25.979 --> 00:49:28.359]  The ACLU filed a lawsuit.
[00:49:28.399 --> 00:49:30.960]  It'll probably get into the Supreme Court in about a year and a half.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.541]  And the legislation will be nullified.
[00:49:34.881 --> 00:49:36.901]  But it's just the blatancy of what they're doing.
[00:49:37.321 --> 00:49:39.021]  And so, they all know each other.
[00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:41.022]  They're all hooked up and connected.
[00:49:41.702 --> 00:49:51.764]  And if something's going down, where you can make money, or go around the law, or if some event like 9-11 is planned, you stay away from the building.
[00:49:52.204 --> 00:49:53.284]  And they know all that stuff.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.601]  And this is what we've got to prove.
[00:49:56.041 --> 00:50:12.527]  We also have to show how they have violated the intent of the Working Group on Financial Markets, which is the executive order which was signed by Ronald Reagan in August of 1988.
[00:50:12.847 --> 00:50:15.308]  The Plunge Protection Team.
[00:50:15.348 --> 00:50:16.388]  Explain what that does.
[00:50:16.408 --> 00:50:18.489]  I mean, that's insider trading right there.
[00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:20.270]  Every day.
[00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:22.691]  24 hours a day, in every market in the world.
[00:50:22.731 --> 00:50:25.152]  It's admittedly rigged, but the public doesn't know that.
[00:50:25.192 --> 00:50:26.033]  Explain to them briefly.
[00:50:26.053 --> 00:50:28.534]  I want to take a few calls.
[00:50:29.134 --> 00:50:47.843]  Well, what the President did at the time was set up the framework that a group within government, and outside government as well, because the Fed's not even government, they're a private corporation, that they could go in emergencies and do things that they wouldn't normally do.
[00:50:49.062 --> 00:51:05.090]  What they have bastardized this thing into is the interpretation, which is distorted like everything else that they do, is when we think there's any kind of a threat whatsoever, because of terrorism in this case,
[00:51:05.956 --> 00:51:08.819]  We can rig the markets 24 hours a day all over the world.
[00:51:08.899 --> 00:51:21.472]  And they selectively go into global markets, the Nasdaq, Standard & Poor's, whatever stocks they want, and then they, some days, put tens of billions in to select funds that they like.
[00:51:21.833 --> 00:51:25.036]  Total criminal cronyism, and they've been caught doing it.
[00:51:25.056 --> 00:51:27.339]  Do Americans know that Richard Grasso, the former head of the
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:34.006]  Of the New York Stock Exchange went to Columbia and publicly at a press conference said, invest your cocaine money with us.
[00:51:34.707 --> 00:51:38.812]  But the average American doesn't even know they're drug dealing in front of everyone.
[00:51:39.172 --> 00:51:41.996]  But they know the public is like Miss North Carolina.
[00:51:42.576 --> 00:51:44.078]  You know, I was watching Beavis and Butthead.
[00:51:44.098 --> 00:51:46.441]  They were re-airing it the other day on TV and I hadn't seen it in decades.
[00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:52.366]  And I was watching Beavis and Butthead, and did you know they are smarter in that cartoon than the average American now?
[00:51:52.386 --> 00:51:58.051]  I mean, actually, watch Beavis and Butthead, and then watch the average college student, and they can't even talk, Bob!
[00:51:58.071 --> 00:51:59.192]  I know.
[00:51:59.432 --> 00:52:00.073]  It's tragic.
[00:52:00.573 --> 00:52:12.123]  And what you say about Grasso is true, and that's why he won his lawsuit, because that was part of the mafioso money laundering deal.
[00:52:13.055 --> 00:52:14.876]  And that's all they were doing, was laundering money.
[00:52:15.196 --> 00:52:18.458]  And he was down there to get that money to run it through the New York Stock Exchange.
[00:52:20.019 --> 00:52:31.144]  I mean, why else would the head of the New York Stock Exchange be in the jungles of Columbia with FARC, which supposedly is a Marxist organization?
[00:52:31.425 --> 00:52:32.785]  Well, he was publicly hugging him.
[00:52:32.825 --> 00:52:33.926]  It was in the news at the time.
[00:52:34.206 --> 00:52:35.006]  No, I saw it.
[00:52:35.127 --> 00:52:35.887]  I saw the pictures.
[00:52:36.647 --> 00:52:39.669]  Now, you're absolutely right, but that's why he was there.
[00:52:40.971 --> 00:52:46.433]  All the great fortunes in the last thousand years have been made from the proceeds of drugs.
[00:52:47.554 --> 00:52:52.976]  The position of the royal families of Europe, which are called the Black Nobility, they were the ones that started it.
[00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:55.297]  And for those that don't know... And that's why they're filthy rich.
[00:52:55.437 --> 00:52:58.118]  That's right, exactly, and those routes out of Asia.
[00:52:58.418 --> 00:53:07.462]  For those that don't know, the mafia in this country, for the nine years of prohibition, they lobbied, in some cases, 10% of their proceeds to keep that law in place.
[00:53:08.342 --> 00:53:10.183]  And then they literally, through fits,
[00:53:11.259 --> 00:53:14.222]  And threatened people and did everything when prohibition was ended.
[00:53:14.522 --> 00:53:18.365]  Don't you understand the big drug cartels, folks, want drugs illegal.
[00:53:18.405 --> 00:53:19.466]  It puts money into it.
[00:53:19.726 --> 00:53:21.208]  It gets the criminal element involved.
[00:53:21.608 --> 00:53:25.151]  When cocaine and heroin were sold on store shelves, hardly anybody was on it.
[00:53:26.072 --> 00:53:28.293]  But again, you can't explain that to people.
[00:53:28.313 --> 00:53:29.054]  They want to be slaves.
[00:53:29.274 --> 00:53:31.116]  Let's take a few calls for Bob Chapman.

[00:53:34.318 --> 00:53:36.480]  Let's go to Jay in Cape Cod.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.622]  Question for Bob Chapman.
[00:53:38.662 --> 00:53:39.262]  You're on the air.
[00:53:39.302 --> 00:53:39.883]  Go ahead, Jay.
[00:53:40.733 --> 00:53:42.105]  Hey, thanks a lot guys for taking my call.
[00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.973]  Go ahead.
[00:53:43.735 --> 00:53:44.635]  Yeah, I have a question.
[00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:53.278]  I was going to purchase some gold, but I was wondering, in a situation like that, if there's some sort of inflationary depression, how would it be useful to even own gold?
[00:53:53.498 --> 00:53:55.498]  Well, you have to ask yourself.
[00:53:55.938 --> 00:54:02.420]  The gold, you can always shell for whatever the rate of the fiat currency is at the time.
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.721]  Bloomberg is talking about gold at $5,000.
[00:54:04.761 --> 00:54:06.921]  I'm not saying that, but it's certainly going up.
[00:54:07.782 --> 00:54:09.462]  At 1980s levels, it's like $2,300 is what it should be for inflation.
[00:54:12.843 --> 00:54:16.304]  And so the fiat currency they can totally devalue.
[00:54:16.324 --> 00:54:19.985]  They can sell your paper, your stocks, your bonds are all worthless tomorrow.
[00:54:20.025 --> 00:54:21.065]  Bob, you want to explain this to him?
[00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:33.868]  Well, when the dollar goes down, especially in an inflationary environment, and that's what we have right now, even though the economy is stagnant, so you call it stagflation.
[00:54:35.228 --> 00:54:39.469]  When you have that situation, when the dollar is going down because of that inflation,
[00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.052]  Some assets will go up in value to offset that.
[00:54:43.752 --> 00:54:46.874]  We've seen that happen in commodities, and it's happening in gold and silver.
[00:54:47.515 --> 00:54:55.600]  The only reason that gold and silver are not higher is that the Working Group on Financial Markets, the Plunge Protection Team, has been suppressing it since 1988.
[00:54:57.261 --> 00:55:00.123]  And they will continue to do so as long as they can.
[00:55:00.203 --> 00:55:05.246]  And by the way, I mean, in real financial circles, listeners, that is common knowledge.
[00:55:05.647 --> 00:55:06.107]  Go ahead, Bob.
[00:55:06.888 --> 00:55:07.448]  Absolutely.
[00:55:07.947 --> 00:55:14.891]  And so, as the value of your currency, the dollar, goes down, the value of gold and silver are going to go up.
[00:55:15.611 --> 00:55:21.495]  And that's going to continue until inflation ends, and we have a deflationary collapse.
[00:55:22.315 --> 00:55:25.337]  And then let's say that gold is $5,000 an ounce.
[00:55:27.058 --> 00:55:30.019]  It could come back down to $4,500, but that's the extent of it.
[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:34.202]  But at the same time, the stock market, which was $14,100, might be $4,000 on the Dow.
[00:55:37.674 --> 00:55:41.897]  We know the house prices have already come down precipitously and they've got a long way to go.
[00:55:41.917 --> 00:55:42.757]  That's right.
[00:55:42.837 --> 00:55:49.221]  Gold and precious metals historically will maintain or get more value during an inflationary trend.
[00:55:49.241 --> 00:55:49.621]  Correct, sir?
[00:55:50.582 --> 00:55:50.842]  Right.
[00:55:51.363 --> 00:55:55.405]  Usually numismatic coins will do twice as well if not more.
[00:55:55.445 --> 00:55:57.907]  Okay, let's take a quick call and we've got to let Bob Chapman go.
[00:55:58.567 --> 00:56:01.029]  Let's go real fast to another call for him.
[00:56:01.409 --> 00:56:02.910]  Let's talk to Sam in Deutschland.
[00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:03.910]  You're on the air from Germany.
[00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.731]  Quickly, Sam.
[00:56:05.777 --> 00:56:07.738]  Alright, hey Bob, I have a quick question.
[00:56:07.778 --> 00:56:22.161]  The question is, I was wondering how you see the economic depression or collapsing United States affecting Western Europe, and also, do you think there's going to be a real high rise of anti-Americanism here in Europe, and maybe it's safer for Americans to go back home, or what's your views on that?
[00:56:23.382 --> 00:56:31.544]  Well, first of all, I can understand the anti-Americanism because of the antics of the United States government, and it's not only in Europe, it's all over the world.
[00:56:32.490 --> 00:56:43.219]  I think in Germany it's probably around 65 to 67 percent, but you go into some South American and Eastern European countries, and Asian countries as well, and you'll have it over 80 percent.
[00:56:43.239 --> 00:56:49.043]  Bob, real fast, you know Ted Anderson was in Buenos Aires down there with his fiancée, and I had him on the show Friday.
[00:56:49.303 --> 00:56:51.925]  He said they're not wanting dollars in Buenos Aires.
[00:56:52.926 --> 00:56:54.407]  That's correct, they're taking Euros.
[00:56:55.548 --> 00:56:56.409]  And that's the currency.
[00:56:57.285 --> 00:57:00.908]  Um, and, you know, in another program we'll get into the Euros.
[00:57:01.389 --> 00:57:13.139]  But, um, the PMI, the producer, uh, the, um, the Purchasing Managers Index in Europe dropped below 50 several months ago.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.122]  And it's headed lower, and it's affecting the whole world.
[00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:19.644]  Bottom line, we're going into an inflationary depression.
[00:57:19.844 --> 00:57:21.786]  Is that 100% with the current policies?
[00:57:23.948 --> 00:57:24.128]  Yes.
[00:57:24.693 --> 00:57:27.436]  Bob Chapman, I don't want to let you... No one's going to escape, believe me.
[00:57:27.756 --> 00:57:29.097]  No one's going to escape, okay.
[00:57:29.358 --> 00:57:35.544]  Bob, let me put you on hold, make sure you're set up for tomorrow, and God bless you, TheInternationalForecaster.com, great info, check it out.
[00:57:35.564 --> 00:57:36.044]  Thanks, Bob.

[00:58:22.783 --> 00:58:30.346]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:34.107]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:59:56.582 --> 00:59:59.304]  Benedict has arrived on his 10-day visit to Australia.
[00:59:59.324 --> 01:00:03.748]  His schedule includes the World Youth Day Festival, which has attracted more than 200,000 people.
[01:00:05.299 --> 01:00:12.185]  The president of the group Broken Rights, Chris MacIsaac, says the Catholic Church must do more to support abuse victims.
[01:00:12.405 --> 01:00:18.831]  They are abused by priests and brothers sexually, and then they take their claim to the church and face more abuse.
[01:00:18.851 --> 01:00:22.634]  Hurricane Bertha could be back down to Tropical Storm Bertha by the end of the day.
[01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:25.097]  The slow-moving storm is spinning about 220 miles from Bermuda.
[01:00:26.978 --> 01:00:31.943]  The island is under a tropical storm warning because of high surf and a lot of rain expected in the next few days.
[01:00:32.443 --> 01:00:36.787]  Jack Bevin with the National Hurricane Center says you can expect some bad weather along the coast.
[01:00:36.947 --> 01:00:41.731]  That could start in the next 12 to 24 hours, depending on how fast the storm actually moves.
[01:00:41.932 --> 01:00:43.773]  Right now, not likely to move very fast.
[01:00:43.853 --> 01:00:46.636]  It may be Monday or Tuesday before they see those conditions.
[01:00:46.816 --> 01:00:48.858]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[01:00:50.299 --> 01:00:51.040]  Psoriasis.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:56.443]  The itching, flaking, and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can be even more devastating.
[01:00:56.543 --> 01:00:57.624]  My body was so sore.
[01:00:57.704 --> 01:00:58.845]  My mind was so worn out.
[01:00:58.925 --> 01:00:59.986]  I could not sleep at night.
[01:01:00.186 --> 01:01:01.207]  I felt self-conscious.
[01:01:01.247 --> 01:01:02.688]  Nobody knows what that flaking is.
[01:01:02.728 --> 01:01:05.149]  And people say, ew, it just made me feel like you're dirty.
[01:01:05.169 --> 01:01:06.210]  I don't want people knowing I have this.
[01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.691]  It's embarrassing.
[01:01:06.711 --> 01:01:08.112]  Of course I felt self-conscious.
[01:01:08.152 --> 01:01:09.492]  Not very attractive to look at.
[01:01:09.553 --> 01:01:15.056]  The solution is new and improved SkinZinc Advanced, the number one OTC treatment for psoriasis.
[01:01:15.116 --> 01:01:17.278]  SkinZinc turned out to be the perfect answer.

[01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:58.606]  Firefighters in California have been making progress during this historically busy fire season, especially around the Sierra Nevada town of Paradise.
[01:01:59.106 --> 01:02:02.327]  And a fire near Big Sur is about 61% contained.
[01:02:02.347 --> 01:02:05.989]  A new concern may come from a forest for heavy rain.
[01:02:06.469 --> 01:02:13.332]  Flash flood watches have been issued in southern and central California, including many fire-scarred areas that are ripe for mudslides.

[01:02:25.359 --> 01:02:27.561]  The two have been mentioned as possible running mates.
[01:02:28.274 --> 01:02:33.077]  And an Israeli official says Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has agreed to release more Palestinian prisoners.
[01:02:33.557 --> 01:02:39.720]  The move is seen as an overture to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as the two sides try to move ahead on peace talks.
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:44.303]  Meanwhile, Israel says a prisoner swap with Hezbollah will take place Wednesday.

[01:02:56.495 --> 01:02:58.155]  Are you in a debt trap you can't get out of?

[01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:29.691]  Former President Bill Clinton is told at Governor's Convention in Philadelphia that despite America's apparent diversity, we're actually hunkering down in communities of like-mindedness.
[01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:34.412]  He warns that such polarization affects our ability to manage difference.
[01:03:35.172 --> 01:03:46.234]  At the conference, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine, who supported Senator Barack Obama, says it was difficult for Democratic politicians to decide which candidate to support during the party's presidential primaries.
[01:03:46.314 --> 01:03:50.896]  This was a hard campaign in that sense because I think the Democratic field was as deep a field as we've ever seen.
[01:03:51.117 --> 01:03:56.419]  Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weiss says he welcomes a chance to talk with Alderman this week.
[01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:05.104]  Weiss met with individual Alderman, angry about a rise in the city's murder rate last week in private, but will go before a public city council hearing Tuesday.
[01:04:05.825 --> 01:04:09.626]  Keeping the streets safe, keeping crime down.
[01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:11.647]  It is not just a law enforcement function.
[01:04:11.907 --> 01:04:13.087]  It is a function of the community.
[01:04:13.127 --> 01:04:14.247]  We've been through this process before.
[01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.368]  They went through it with DVDs.
[01:04:35.649 --> 01:04:41.474]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, we need radical change if we're to avert becoming a third world nation.
[01:04:41.554 --> 01:04:46.159]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health solutions.
[01:05:01.172 --> 01:05:02.852]  Introducing Orgon products.
[01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:07.953]  Orgon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all matter on the material planet.
[01:05:08.133 --> 01:05:12.634]  Orgon Electro Medicine is the wave of the future, dating back to the late 1800s.
[01:05:12.814 --> 01:05:19.195]  Wilhelm Reich Orgon used cloud buster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic energy savings of up to 25%.
[01:05:19.955 --> 01:05:23.956]  The possible uses for this device are only limited by your imagination.

[01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:26.230]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.692 --> 01:06:39.882]  Well, he is an icon in the movement to awaken people to the fact that there's a shadow world government, a power behind the throne, a system of control that's now becoming more and more evident.
[01:06:40.203 --> 01:06:41.424]  We talk about world government
[01:06:42.577 --> 01:06:43.218]  We're good to go.
[01:07:02.638 --> 01:07:06.241]  And so he is our guest for this hour.
[01:07:06.261 --> 01:07:07.943]  Total free number to join us, 877-590-5525.
[01:07:08.063 --> 01:07:13.767]  And I know we've got folks holding, we'll get to you at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:13.807 --> 01:07:14.988]  We've got a lot of stuff to cover.
[01:07:15.229 --> 01:07:29.140]  Before we go to Jordan, Maxwell, to be clear, the same government, the same private banks, the same private Federal Reserve that told you it was all fixed with Northern Rock and Countrywide collapsing, U.S.
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.222]  regulators take control of struggling bank,
[01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:38.242]  And they go on to say in this article that the Feds are promising that everything is fine.
[01:07:38.842 --> 01:07:42.605]  The politicians rally behind Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac as well.
[01:07:43.085 --> 01:07:49.750]  As if companies fail, which are leveraged in the thousands of trillions, but are worth over $50 trillion on paper.
[01:07:51.911 --> 01:07:52.231]  You're right.
[01:07:52.251 --> 01:07:52.632]  You heard me.
[01:07:52.712 --> 01:07:53.612]  I said trillion.
[01:07:53.632 --> 01:07:55.734]  In fact, here it is in the Associated Press.
[01:07:55.754 --> 01:08:02.198]  The two companies own or guarantee more than $5 trillion of home loans, about half of all the mortgage debt.
[01:08:02.782 --> 01:08:04.403]  And it's leveraged many times that.
[01:08:04.463 --> 01:08:05.504]  No one really knows.
[01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:07.205]  It's just we know thousands of times.
[01:08:07.566 --> 01:08:09.087]  So what's thousands of times five trillion?
[01:08:09.867 --> 01:08:13.690]  And with that, they've bought lake houses and coal mines and gold mines.
[01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.092]  And that's why they set up the police state.
[01:08:16.112 --> 01:08:17.233]  We have the IMF documents.
[01:08:17.253 --> 01:08:26.640]  They said, my God, when the public finds out we've done this, they are going to go ape when we tell them they're all slaves of government, which slaves to pay the debt that we created to get real assets.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.222]  Oh my God.
[01:08:28.383 --> 01:08:34.941]  But they tell you everything's fine, everything's wonderful, the dollar's strong, go into deeper debt, let's keep cutting interest rates.
[01:08:36.303 --> 01:08:48.074]  Bush is saying he backs Israel striking Iran, and he says, this is the Times of London, that if Iran defends itself in any way, that is terrorism and nuclear weapons will be used against them.
[01:08:48.234 --> 01:08:49.155]  Right here I have the news.
[01:08:49.735 --> 01:08:59.845]  Imagine, we're going to blow the daylights out of you, and if you fight back in any way, our cattle will be told that we're attacking you for that reason, and then oil prices will more than quadruple.
[01:09:00.325 --> 01:09:01.165]  According to OPEC.
[01:09:01.525 --> 01:09:03.286]  So, you think things are bad?
[01:09:03.626 --> 01:09:07.407]  The government is doing everything it can to push us into this.
[01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:10.008]  The private banks are doing everything they can to push us into this.
[01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:14.569]  Shifting gears and going to Jordan Maxwell, there's so many things to talk about.
[01:09:14.989 --> 01:09:20.731]  I thought we could go from the current and what's happening to really the history and then today's master plan.
[01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:22.491]  Why the elite are doing this?
[01:09:22.991 --> 01:09:25.232]  What they plan to set up here on planet Earth?
[01:09:25.852 --> 01:09:29.655]  And we have links to his website up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:29.975 --> 01:09:31.216]  Jordan, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:09:31.576 --> 01:09:32.577]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:09:32.677 --> 01:09:33.878]  Always happy to be with you.
[01:09:34.478 --> 01:09:41.263]  You're doing one hell of a job that very few other people have the courage or the wherewithal to do.
[01:09:41.423 --> 01:09:43.885]  So I really applaud you for what you're doing.
[01:09:44.665 --> 01:09:51.330]  And I've said publicly that I'm not the man that you are, because you've shown yourself to be very brave.
[01:09:52.031 --> 01:09:52.572]  I'm not sure.
[01:09:52.612 --> 01:09:54.373]  I'm not brave at all, really.
[01:09:54.493 --> 01:10:04.523]  I'm more scared than I am anything else, because I realize the absolute dimensions of how big this problem really is.
[01:10:04.643 --> 01:10:05.944]  It's not just America.
[01:10:06.504 --> 01:10:11.449]  The whole world is in trouble, and so goes America, so goes the world.
[01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:17.415]  This stuff is really, really frightening, and that's why I don't do much radio anymore.
[01:10:18.787 --> 01:10:22.668]  The joy of doing radio, I used to really enjoy doing radio.
[01:10:22.748 --> 01:10:24.789]  I've had my own show seven times.
[01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:29.110]  My last show was the best of the seven.
[01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:35.152]  I was doing a pretty big show here in Los Angeles on ABC Affiliate.
[01:10:35.772 --> 01:10:42.934]  Saturday night, had a huge audience and got in trouble and the thing shut down.
[01:10:44.415 --> 01:10:47.436]  So since then, I have not been, especially since 9-11, I have
[01:10:49.455 --> 01:10:51.576]  Really shied away from the public.
[01:10:51.596 --> 01:10:55.078]  Well, since you bring this up, let's just go ahead and talk a little bit about it if it's okay.
[01:10:55.778 --> 01:11:00.340]  George Norrie says the three top hosts on Coast to Coast are you, myself, and David Icke, of course.
[01:11:00.741 --> 01:11:03.182]  And you even, a lot of times, don't go on that show now.
[01:11:03.682 --> 01:11:06.083]  You have been visited by the Feds and threatened to shut up.
[01:11:06.123 --> 01:11:07.324]  I mean, they know.
[01:11:08.144 --> 01:11:11.526]  We even have had the Feds drop by and try to threaten us.
[01:11:11.946 --> 01:11:13.628]  I mean, they don't even make bones about it now.
[01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:15.910]  They know we're exposing their criminal operation.
[01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:17.371]  They are very upset.
[01:11:17.471 --> 01:11:19.653]  I don't like to do the enemy's intimidating for them.
[01:11:19.993 --> 01:11:28.000]  But folks, if you don't know how real this is, and the death threats that Jordan Maxwell's gotten, you know, Jordan, I think you're going to get more though, because they know it's getting to you.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.482]  I mean, I know you're a wise guy, I've been doing this for 50 years, but me, I just say, hey, I'm committed.
[01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:35.583]  I mean, I've already gone all the way into this.
[01:11:36.023 --> 01:11:38.404]  I mean, the Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[01:11:38.724 --> 01:11:40.625]  Bush has won 5 points below Nixon.
[01:11:40.685 --> 01:11:41.625]  Both parties are hated.
[01:11:41.905 --> 01:11:42.946]  I think we're kicking their butt.
[01:11:43.006 --> 01:11:44.066]  That's why they're threatening us.
[01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:45.707]  Well, I'm sure you're right.
[01:11:45.887 --> 01:11:52.930]  I'm sure their whole world is falling apart, which, you know, it goes back to the laws of God, so to speak.
[01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:53.890]  I mean, there are laws in
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:01.365]  In the universe, basically have said from time in the beginning that what you do comes back on you.
[01:12:01.425 --> 01:12:02.505]  What you sow, you reap.
[01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:10.851]  And these people have been sowing violence and corruption and lies and deception from day one.
[01:12:10.871 --> 01:12:14.854]  I mean, it goes all the way back to even the founding of this country.
[01:12:14.874 --> 01:12:22.519]  It goes back to the British East India Company and the hidden corporations and all the machinations going on in Europe.
[01:12:23.538 --> 01:12:24.259]  I don't
[01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:45.756]  uh... the wars between crips and the bloods for who's going to eat up and own the human rights and the gangs agree to never let the slaves in on what's happening.
[01:12:45.776 --> 01:12:46.717]  That's exactly right.
[01:12:47.057 --> 01:12:56.062]  Cannot allow the people to know what the name of the tune and how this thing is really being played and I was aware of it as a kid.
[01:12:56.082 --> 01:13:04.547]  I was already aware of the dimensions of the thing in my life and the older I got the more I began to
[01:13:05.308 --> 01:13:07.990]  See, no, it was bigger than what I thought it was.
[01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:11.292]  It was bigger than our state that we lived in.
[01:13:11.312 --> 01:13:13.853]  And then I began to see, no, it's bigger than this country.
[01:13:13.873 --> 01:13:26.380]  And by the time I really got going, about 1959 and 60, I realized this is a monumental struggle, not just for America.
[01:13:27.381 --> 01:13:32.184]  I don't see it any longer as a struggle for America against tyranny.
[01:13:32.364 --> 01:13:34.285]  I see it for the human race.
[01:13:35.293 --> 01:14:03.973]  The human race itself is now in jeopardy and its very existence has been called into question as far as I'm concerned because the problems that this country and the good people of the world face is so horrendous in its dimensions and so awesome in scope that it's absolutely frightening and that's why so many people think, and I've had people tell me that,
[01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:09.646]  That you're making a lot of noise about, you know, just politics as usual.
[01:14:10.427 --> 01:14:11.869]  No, it's intensifying.
[01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:13.071]  It's at warp speed.
[01:14:13.091 --> 01:14:17.156]  Every expert I talk to in every genre, everybody can feel it.
[01:14:17.256 --> 01:14:19.319]  Something big is happening.
[01:14:19.899 --> 01:14:40.936]  And the FEMA camps, that they're announcing they built camps on the news, and the preachers have been hired to be spies, and they're poisoning the water and the food and putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, and it comes out in Canadian news that they're currently murdering the children of Native Americans up there, the government is, and the government says, we're not going to stop, and it's just, it's just hell is being released.
[01:14:41.136 --> 01:14:48.182]  That's why I said, what is happening now on the earth is calling into question the veracity
[01:14:48.749 --> 01:14:51.090]  of the human experiment on Earth.
[01:14:51.510 --> 01:15:00.452]  I mean we are now at a point to where we're not, I don't even think in terms of saving America as opposed to the rest of the world.
[01:15:00.692 --> 01:15:07.733]  I'm thinking in terms, because I've been looking at this for so long, the entire world is in trouble now.
[01:15:08.194 --> 01:15:09.854]  Let's talk about their master plan.
[01:15:10.734 --> 01:15:13.855]  What do top corporate leaders, top scientists say?
[01:15:13.955 --> 01:15:26.358]  They say that their main plan, publicly in hundreds of books, government documents, is to kill 80-90% of us and then to engineer a suboid servant class to serve the elite who will go to the stars.
[01:15:26.638 --> 01:15:29.439]  We're going to talk about that with Jordan Maxwell when we get back.
[01:15:29.519 --> 01:15:32.760]  The biggest secret on the other side, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:50.181]  Question.
[01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:53.824]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:15:55.145 --> 01:15:59.569]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:00.190]  Question.
[01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:04.034]  Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[01:16:05.734 --> 01:16:06.275]  Question.
[01:16:06.515 --> 01:16:10.178]  Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[01:18:51.984 --> 01:18:52.284]  Look!
[01:18:52.685 --> 01:18:55.586]  Up there in the sky, it's Non-X-Man!
[01:18:56.207 --> 01:18:57.307]  He's in a dive!
[01:18:57.888 --> 01:18:59.869]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[01:19:00.409 --> 01:19:01.110]  Let's go look.
[01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:04.952]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[01:19:05.512 --> 01:19:06.853]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:19:07.374 --> 01:19:07.814]  Take them out.
[01:19:08.294 --> 01:19:08.934]  Let's see them.
[01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:13.417]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:19:13.737 --> 01:19:14.258]  Don't worry.
[01:19:14.778 --> 01:19:16.119]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[01:19:16.619 --> 01:19:20.682]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic in sandals.
[01:19:21.322 --> 01:19:23.603]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[01:19:23.924 --> 01:19:24.224]  Great.
[01:19:24.784 --> 01:19:27.646]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:19:29.875 --> 01:19:32.516]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:19:32.976 --> 01:19:36.438]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[01:19:36.978 --> 01:19:48.144]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[01:19:52.046 --> 01:19:56.828]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:04.295 --> 01:20:06.157]  Check out the new PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:20:06.177 --> 01:20:10.740]  It's been redesigned, and if you like the old classic site, it's updated daily.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.021]  Two sites in one.
[01:20:12.362 --> 01:20:14.363]  Classic.PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:20:14.783 --> 01:20:20.428]  Or when you're on PrisonPlanet.com's homepage, just click on the banner that says, Miss the Old Prison Planet?
[01:20:20.728 --> 01:20:21.909]  Prison Planet Classic!
[01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:25.172]  I know 10-20% of you didn't like the new site.
[01:20:25.212 --> 01:20:25.752]  Well, there!
[01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:27.754]  We aim to please in the Info War!
[01:20:29.068 --> 01:20:31.268]  Stabbing the New World Order in the heart every day with pleasure.
[01:20:31.769 --> 01:20:32.909]  Here, you want it, you got it.
[01:20:33.369 --> 01:20:34.129]  Whatever you want.
[01:20:35.049 --> 01:20:44.011]  My new film, Truth Rising, is now available on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:20:47.932 --> 01:20:49.672]  That's right, I'm past the point of Karen.
[01:20:52.513 --> 01:20:54.213]  I'm going all the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:57.154 --> 01:20:57.894]  I am committed.
[01:21:01.275 --> 01:21:04.443]  No, not gonna let him catch the Midnight Rider.
[01:21:04.463 --> 01:21:09.375]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to Jordan Maxwell, an amazing individual, jordanmaxwell.com.
[01:21:11.135 --> 01:21:15.038]  Jordan, let's get into who the globalists are, how they understand how humans operate.
[01:21:15.619 --> 01:21:30.112]  This is our own species who understands what makes people tick, how to mesmerize, how to use basically magician-like trickery, sleight of hand, to control the population, to change the language, to bring in systems of control.
[01:21:30.492 --> 01:21:34.876]  They own the Earth, and as a lot of top scientists and the owners of Sun Microsystems and
[01:21:35.396 --> 01:21:36.036]  So many others.
[01:21:36.096 --> 01:21:37.156]  I cover this in Endgame.
[01:21:37.637 --> 01:21:49.259]  They say the plan is to get a world government in to start the extermination, but then they will also have a suboid, I guess kind of a Blade Runner-like, genetic-engineered replicant.
[01:21:49.679 --> 01:21:52.000]  It's not an android in the classical sense.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:56.721]  It's an engineered humanoid using its flesh and blood grown in the wombs of cows.
[01:21:57.001 --> 01:21:57.601]  That's BBC.
[01:21:58.321 --> 01:22:00.903]  I mean, as far back as 1948, we're talking a long time ago, there was a movie came out
[01:22:27.716 --> 01:22:32.080]  Uh, called, uh, Island of Lost Souls with Charles Lawton.
[01:22:32.921 --> 01:22:41.487]  And then in 1965, 66, I think it was, Burt Lancaster remade the movie and called it The Island of Dr. Moreau.
[01:22:42.528 --> 01:22:53.577]  And then just a few years ago, the last movie I believe it was that Marlon Brando made before he died was, uh, The Island of Dr. Moreau, a remake.
[01:22:54.207 --> 01:22:59.330]  In which the whole story, and we're talking about three times Hollywood has presented this, as far back as 1948.
[01:22:59.390 --> 01:23:03.253]  Well there's another one, the island just came out where they grow these humanoids.
[01:23:03.573 --> 01:23:05.414]  Oh, well that's a fourth one then.
[01:23:05.975 --> 01:23:16.702]  Where Hollywood is telling you that they have that concept and the idea of crossing humans with animals is a very old idea.
[01:23:16.722 --> 01:23:20.724]  They were talking about this kind of thing back in pre-Nazi Germany.
[01:23:21.244 --> 01:23:23.526]  As a matter of fact, there was a lot of talk about it.
[01:23:24.128 --> 01:23:28.672]  In pre-communist Russia, and I told you last time we talked about A.R.
[01:23:28.752 --> 01:23:49.510]  Luria and Ivan Pavlov with the Pavlonian dog, there has been an ongoing effort to completely redesign the human race, and it's taken from, the concept was taken from and mistakenly taken from the Bible, where the scripture talks about the new man
[01:23:50.555 --> 01:23:51.015]  We're good to go.
[01:24:13.542 --> 01:24:18.183]  They understand things like that far better than we shall ever begin to.
[01:24:18.443 --> 01:24:19.303]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:24:19.923 --> 01:24:25.845]  For those that are laughing at us right now, I just googled Human-Cow-Clone, BBC, AP, Reuters.
[01:24:26.165 --> 01:24:27.805]  They made these ten years ago.
[01:24:28.305 --> 01:24:29.985]  Now they're just now telling us about it.
[01:24:30.025 --> 01:24:35.287]  You can go read it, or read Human-Animal-Hybrid, thousands of articles.
[01:24:35.587 --> 01:24:41.568]  But I have people, every time I talk about this, sending me emails laughing, because they've been preconditioned to not understand we're in 2008, Jordan.
[01:24:42.588 --> 01:24:43.009]  That's right.
[01:24:43.049 --> 01:24:46.538]  And as you said, they were cloning rabbits 60 years ago, they just kept it quiet.
[01:24:47.179 --> 01:24:48.342]  Wasn't there a sheep that was half...
[01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:54.113]  Uh, that had, uh, human... Yeah, that was a decade ago, too.
[01:24:54.314 --> 01:24:54.774]  Yeah.
[01:24:54.794 --> 01:24:56.876]  We're talking ten years ago.
[01:24:57.236 --> 01:24:58.017]  That's what they admit!
[01:24:58.037 --> 01:24:58.597]  Yeah.
[01:24:58.617 --> 01:25:00.379]  And then you actually read the doc... Well, here's an example.
[01:25:00.619 --> 01:25:11.089]  Washington Post five years ago admitted they have human chimpanzee crosses, and they say they don't have rights, so they can take their organs, and they say they're in Argentina, but, uh, in labs, but you're not allowed to see them.
[01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:12.850]  I mean, that's... It's done, folks.
[01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:13.571]  It's going on.
[01:25:14.111 --> 01:25:43.020]  It's going on for sure and and if you know some of these things which are happening would be so frightening to the world of mankind generally then and they know that that's why it's it's always been behind the scenes but there's no doubt in my mind that that these stories that we hear about human sacrifices, child sacrifices, satanic cults all of this is in point of fact actually happening but it implies something even far far more
[01:25:43.809 --> 01:25:44.329]  I don't
[01:26:09.378 --> 01:26:16.284]  That there is something to this biblical concept in the Old Testament of angels that look like men.
[01:26:16.384 --> 01:26:19.426]  Yeah, the Nephilim, and it talks about genetic engineering.
[01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:19.986]  That's right.
[01:26:20.387 --> 01:26:23.829]  And a bunch of, and again, I never get into these subjects, but you're right.
[01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:29.174]  And certainly the elites do believe, and I've been to Bohemian Grove, it kicks off tomorrow by the way.
[01:26:29.474 --> 01:26:31.195]  I've been to a lot of these other things and covered them.
[01:26:31.455 --> 01:26:35.298]  The elite, whether you believe it or not, they do believe in this.
[01:26:35.359 --> 01:26:38.381]  And I've had high-level NASA people on, they're all into the occult.
[01:26:39.041 --> 01:26:46.703]  This stuff is going on, and they believe that they are becoming more human than human, these God-men through genetic engineering.
[01:26:47.163 --> 01:26:48.384]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:50.844 --> 01:27:06.789]  Just to take for a moment, if you believe the Bible, and if you have any respect for the Bible, in the book of Genesis 18, it talks about when three men come walking up into the camp of Abraham and Sarah.
[01:27:07.398 --> 01:27:15.120]  And Abraham immediately, the scripture says, ran out and bowed down to the three men and said, what is my Lord saying to his servant?
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:24.322]  Then the men told Abraham that they were on their way on business and were just coming by on the way.
[01:27:24.842 --> 01:27:29.503]  And Abraham invited them to stay for dinner to have something to eat.
[01:27:29.643 --> 01:27:30.364]  They said no.
[01:27:30.444 --> 01:27:32.584]  They were and they were busy and had to go.
[01:27:32.784 --> 01:27:33.784]  And he insisted.
[01:27:33.945 --> 01:27:35.705]  So they said, all right, but make it quick.
[01:27:36.437 --> 01:27:56.927]  So the scripture says in Genesis 18 that the four men sat under a tree, had dinner, then two of the men got up and left, and the third one sitting there was the Creator God Himself, Almighty God, in the capital letters, Himself sat there with Abraham under the tree.
[01:27:56.947 --> 01:27:58.328]  That's Melchizedek, right?
[01:27:58.548 --> 01:27:58.888]  Yes!
[01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:02.690]  But the point is that the two men that got up
[01:28:03.856 --> 01:28:16.265]  Toward the end of the 18th chapter are the same two men at the beginning of the 19th chapter, which are the two angels that went into Sodom and Gomorrah, where the homosexuals thought they were good-looking, handsome men.
[01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:17.125]  Bizarre.
[01:28:17.166 --> 01:28:17.966]  It's just incredible.
[01:28:17.986 --> 01:28:19.287]  Look, here it is, National Geographic.
[01:28:19.667 --> 01:28:22.609]  Animal-human hybrid spark controversy, January 20, 2005.
[01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:29.134]  But you tell the public they're crossing humans with spiders, goats, everything else, they just laugh at you.
[01:28:29.634 --> 01:28:30.835]  Yes, it's really going on.
[01:28:30.875 --> 01:28:34.377]  We're exploring some of the more bizarre beliefs of the elite with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:28:34.797 --> 01:28:37.719]  And they're now manifesting their ancient beliefs and actually creating it.
[01:28:37.999 --> 01:28:38.460]  Stay with us.
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.442]  Every 22 seconds, a violent crime is committed.
[01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:54.723]  Are you concerned about your personal safety?
[01:28:55.023 --> 01:28:58.345]  Why wait for something bad to happen when you can take action now?
[01:28:58.645 --> 01:28:59.325]  Be smart.
[01:28:59.586 --> 01:29:00.286]  Be safe.
[01:29:00.566 --> 01:29:02.527]  Trust Pepper Spray instead of your luck.

[01:29:44.526 --> 01:29:44.907]  Call today!
[01:29:49.545 --> 01:29:50.906]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[01:29:51.146 --> 01:29:54.669]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[01:29:54.809 --> 01:30:00.733]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[01:30:00.873 --> 01:30:04.616]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[01:30:04.936 --> 01:30:08.319]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[01:30:08.539 --> 01:30:09.420]  Liberty of conscience.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:14.144]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[01:30:14.345 --> 01:30:18.108]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[01:30:18.408 --> 01:30:20.811]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[01:30:21.011 --> 01:30:26.116]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[01:30:26.316 --> 01:30:29.699]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[01:30:29.999 --> 01:30:32.582]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[01:30:32.762 --> 01:30:35.304]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[01:30:35.524 --> 01:30:37.245]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:38.806]  Jesus is coming soon!

[01:30:50.231 --> 01:30:57.415]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[01:30:57.675 --> 01:31:01.198]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[01:31:01.718 --> 01:31:05.360]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:15.086]  The only solution is to use now and store for later great flavored super bulk foods that cost half as much as your groceries cost last year.

[01:32:39.946 --> 01:32:41.287]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:42.828]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:33:06.204 --> 01:33:11.029]  Yep, I have my own little syndicated broadcast reaching millions every day, Monday through Friday.
[01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:14.832]  But I come back here on Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:14.872 --> 01:33:15.332]  Central.
[01:33:17.595 --> 01:33:18.676]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:18.716 --> 01:33:19.937]  Got about 27 minutes left.

[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:24.281]  It is the 13th day.
[01:33:28.692 --> 01:33:29.072]  of July 2008.
[01:33:29.172 --> 01:33:31.414]  If you're wondering, we're live 877-590-5525.
[01:33:31.574 --> 01:33:35.636]  We've got a lot of callers.
[01:33:35.896 --> 01:33:37.317]  Jim, Mark, many others.
[01:33:37.597 --> 01:33:40.338]  Whatever subjects you want to talk about, we will get to you.
[01:33:41.539 --> 01:33:42.299]  Here's another one.
[01:33:42.379 --> 01:33:45.221]  I just typed human-animal hybrid.
[01:33:45.501 --> 01:33:46.442]  Thousands of articles.
[01:33:46.742 --> 01:33:49.023]  Here's MIT Technology Review.
[01:33:49.043 --> 01:33:51.804]  Technology published by MIT is the website.
[01:33:52.765 --> 01:33:56.167]  Human-pig hybrid for human body parts.
[01:33:57.807 --> 01:33:59.248]  And they get around the legalese.
[01:34:00.129 --> 01:34:01.550]  They grow humanoids.
[01:34:02.371 --> 01:34:02.912]  They just change.
[01:34:03.292 --> 01:34:03.872]  They're really human.
[01:34:03.892 --> 01:34:05.274]  They change a small amount of their genetics.
[01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:07.976]  And then like a human, it looks like a spider.
[01:34:07.996 --> 01:34:09.057]  It's got spider genetics.
[01:34:09.077 --> 01:34:11.820]  In the case of spider goats, they've had for more than 15 years.
[01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:22.189]  The udders actually do produce webs so that they have the same cell ganglia that produce the spinnerets that a spider has in their udders.
[01:34:23.522 --> 01:34:29.303]  There are actually cases where parts of the animal are completely alien to their original genome.
[01:34:29.363 --> 01:34:35.025]  It gives rise to super viruses and other things that are already spreading throughout the genome, killing all sorts of trees and animals.
[01:34:35.445 --> 01:34:38.125]  But don't worry, they're not going to stop all that.
[01:34:38.165 --> 01:34:38.985]  They're going to continue that.
[01:34:39.205 --> 01:34:45.567]  They're going to tax carbon dioxide that is what the plants breathe and it needs to be higher for a larger
[01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:48.841]  Biomass be able to support it.
[01:34:49.382 --> 01:34:54.346]  But they aren't going to do anything about all the real environmental destruction, the overfishing, and cutting down of the rainforest.
[01:34:54.367 --> 01:34:55.468]  That's all going to continue.
[01:34:56.148 --> 01:34:58.490]  And it's going to hurt us, who are on this planet as well.
[01:34:59.752 --> 01:35:02.554]  Fake environmentalism for the real one.
[01:35:03.015 --> 01:35:04.496]  Going back to Jordan Maxwell.
[01:35:04.937 --> 01:35:10.782]  Jordan, why do the elite want to exterminate the vast majority of us?
[01:35:10.802 --> 01:35:12.704]  I mean, even before they could claim we were overcrowded,
[01:35:13.608 --> 01:35:24.695]  Plato, as you reported in his Republic, said the elite needed to kill the vast majority of the population and then breed the rest to work in kind of like insects in specialized areas.
[01:35:25.055 --> 01:35:27.076]  I mean, this has been going on for 2,400 years then!
[01:35:28.397 --> 01:35:39.484]  Yeah, I'm afraid so, but you know, as well as I do, the ancient world is filled with the reports and stories of aliens and extraterrestrial
[01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:52.776]  Influences, the Bible is filled with it, so I'm of the opinion that we've been under attack, the human family has been under attack ever since its creation by an otherworldly force.
[01:35:52.816 --> 01:36:06.222]  And if you think that's foolish, you know, I have my webman, while you were on the break, put up quickly a picture on my website on the home page of a book I've had for a long time
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.241]  put out by the U.S.
[01:36:08.401 --> 01:36:09.482]  Army War College.
[01:36:09.582 --> 01:36:13.425]  It's called the World 2010 A New Order of Nations.
[01:36:14.886 --> 01:36:16.447]  You can't find this thing anywhere.
[01:36:16.487 --> 01:36:21.650]  I've had a copy of it and you can go on my website just for today for the moment and see it.
[01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:27.675]  I just had him put it up for just a few minutes ago and it's really interesting.
[01:36:27.695 --> 01:36:30.657]  It talks about how the whole world is going to be changed.
[01:36:31.197 --> 01:36:31.657]  The U.S.
[01:36:31.817 --> 01:36:35.280]  Army War College has been preparing the whole world for
[01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.999]  The new order of the world that's coming, and the U.S.
[01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:40.560]  Army has been planning it.
[01:36:41.361 --> 01:36:42.802]  They've been planning the whole thing.
[01:36:42.842 --> 01:36:46.085]  They've got it all figured out, how they're going to carve up civilization.
[01:36:46.265 --> 01:37:01.178]  And now we have the British Ministry of Defense report last year saying they will use neutron bombs on rebelling populations in the West, race-specific bioweapons, and admitting in official policy that the state is waging war on their own people.
[01:37:01.318 --> 01:37:02.019]  Well, I know.
[01:37:02.279 --> 01:37:05.601]  Well, I mean, for the listeners though, that's all, you can go find that right now.
[01:37:05.661 --> 01:37:16.488]  So you believe from your research and all the ancient texts and what the elites believe, and I know they believe it, I don't know if it's real, I know they believe they're in contact with what you call, you know, they call spirits or you call extraterrestrials.
[01:37:16.888 --> 01:37:22.252]  They, you believe and they believe, and I know they believe, that they're being directed in some master plan.
[01:37:22.272 --> 01:37:24.193]  I mean, there's no doubting they believe that.
[01:37:24.553 --> 01:37:28.536]  Well, I mean, look at, here's the bottom line on that as far as I'm concerned.
[01:37:29.056 --> 01:37:30.457]  They are in power.
[01:37:31.204 --> 01:37:32.185]  We are not.
[01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:33.807]  They believe it.
[01:37:34.268 --> 01:37:34.968]  We do not.
[01:37:35.589 --> 01:37:36.510]  What does that tell you?
[01:37:37.211 --> 01:37:41.636]  And so I'm thinking that not only do they believe it, they damn well know it's true.
[01:37:43.278 --> 01:37:43.778]  Period.
[01:37:44.159 --> 01:37:49.965]  That's why they have the power, because they have thrown in with the dark side of world
[01:37:51.304 --> 01:37:52.044]  Occultism.
[01:37:52.905 --> 01:37:54.585]  And occult just means hidden.
[01:37:54.825 --> 01:37:55.566]  Yeah, of course.
[01:37:56.026 --> 01:37:58.427]  I know you know that, but the listeners don't.
[01:37:58.527 --> 01:38:11.171]  So you're saying from your 50 years of study, and getting into the libraries and reading the elite text, that this earth spinning through the cosmos is being manipulated by an outside force.
[01:38:11.211 --> 01:38:12.672]  That's my belief, totally.
[01:38:12.692 --> 01:38:17.833]  Well, the Bible says it's Satan, but you're saying Satan isn't that ancient image we have, it's something else.
[01:38:17.933 --> 01:38:19.314]  Well, no, because as far as
[01:38:20.074 --> 01:38:26.875]  But the concept is there in the Bible and in Christianity is Satan, but it's also in the Old Testament.
[01:38:27.295 --> 01:38:35.737]  But it is also in all the ancient holy writings of the world talk about the other side, the dark side of the world.
[01:38:35.757 --> 01:38:41.218]  The dark side are, generally speaking, occult powers in the world.
[01:38:41.978 --> 01:38:47.999]  Almost every nation in the world has taught that there is something else going on on this earth besides us.
[01:38:49.042 --> 01:38:55.026]  And that we have some kind of a connection with other world entities from someplace else.
[01:38:55.687 --> 01:39:01.211]  Ask any six-year-old child in a Christian nation, where is God?
[01:39:01.311 --> 01:39:02.692]  And they will point straight up.
[01:39:03.333 --> 01:39:09.237]  You ask anybody, any Christian or Jew that believes in the angels of the Bible, ask them where is God?
[01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:11.311]  And where do angels come from?
[01:39:11.511 --> 01:39:12.972]  Well, they'll point out there.
[01:39:13.352 --> 01:39:19.174]  But every culture, they just went into the middle of the Amazon and found the new group of people and they have the same cosmology.
[01:39:19.254 --> 01:39:20.775]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:39:20.835 --> 01:39:26.218]  The whole world has always been aware that we are not alone on this earth.
[01:39:26.318 --> 01:39:31.940]  It's only our elite masters who try and put it down and act like it doesn't happen.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:35.342]  But they not only believe it, they know it.
[01:39:36.022 --> 01:39:37.323]  That's the point I'm making.
[01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:42.437]  The world is being led not by the normal people you think they are.
[01:39:42.637 --> 01:39:43.919]  Well, Jordan, I know this.
[01:39:45.442 --> 01:39:48.146]  The elite do believe what you're saying.
[01:39:48.166 --> 01:39:52.594]  I mean, it's in mainstream British news that Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth's husband
[01:39:52.978 --> 01:39:53.458]  Well, you know what?
[01:39:53.478 --> 01:39:55.339]  A long time ago, a dear friend of mine, Norio Hayakawa,
[01:40:23.015 --> 01:40:27.059]  Uh, used to talk about that all the time, about how he thought that the U.S.
[01:40:27.119 --> 01:40:42.076]  government and other governments with it were planning on having a fake UFO event that would frighten the world, you know, kind of like what the movie Independence Day portrayed.
[01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:50.099]  And that there would be a fake landing of UFOs or something, and it would scare the whole world, and they would all join into one world.
[01:40:50.139 --> 01:40:52.721]  Well, I mean, I've now seen declassified Pentagon plans to do that.
[01:40:53.581 --> 01:41:00.045]  But I, at the time, I heard this many years ago at the table with a bunch of other speakers and researchers.
[01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:08.809]  I suggested to Norio that I could look at the same facts that he's using and come up with a different scenario.
[01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:11.811]  I said at that time, and this was about 20 years ago,
[01:41:12.986 --> 01:41:39.495]  I said suppose in point of fact there is going to be an alien invasion and it's not going to be a put-up job by government but let us assume for the moment that there is going to in fact be an alien invasion from somewhere out there and that the people in power on this earth have known that for a long time and are trying to prepare
[01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:53.936]  Well, if you look at all the movies and all the culture and three football sized long things hovering over Denton outside Dallas, I mean, my problem is I can't get the public to admit FEMA camps are real when it's in the Houston Chronicle.
[01:41:53.976 --> 01:41:54.597]  I understand.
[01:41:54.737 --> 01:42:00.080]  Or that they're creating half human, half other animal creatures when I've got thousands of mainstream news articles.
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.822]  So, I mean, no doubt they're hyping it, they're pushing it.
[01:42:04.122 --> 01:42:05.482]  No doubt the elites believe it.
[01:42:05.783 --> 01:42:07.684]  No doubt we're a planet hurtling through space.
[01:42:08.644 --> 01:42:09.204]  It's wild.
[01:42:09.244 --> 01:42:14.106]  Wow, Jordan Maxwell, folks, really covering some interesting things here with us today.
[01:42:14.126 --> 01:42:20.927]  We're going to come back and talk to Jim, Mark, and a few other people on the other side in the final segment.
[01:42:21.448 --> 01:42:26.509]  And I know this, the stock market is certainly plunging, and they certainly are devaluing the dollar.
[01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:29.610]  And I can't even get the public to realize they're devaluing the dollar.
[01:42:29.971 --> 01:42:32.532]  And what it's going to mean once it finally implodes completely.
[01:42:33.132 --> 01:42:37.554]  So, uh, that's why I don't ever try to tackle other things that are so esoteric.
[01:42:37.755 --> 01:42:39.996]  Well, go on the, uh, go on my website.
[01:42:40.356 --> 01:42:42.757]  That's the home page, because it's not going to be there very long.
[01:42:42.897 --> 01:42:43.437]  Jordan, stay there.
[01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:44.078]  We're going to come back.
[01:42:44.138 --> 01:42:44.698]  Final segment.
[01:42:44.718 --> 01:42:45.138]  Stay with me.
[01:42:45.338 --> 01:42:46.239]  We'll come back and plug that.

[01:47:02.529 --> 01:47:05.271]  Well, time has really flown past us quickly.
[01:47:05.311 --> 01:47:14.697]  We covered the imploding dollar and the banks falling one by one by design as they inflate the currency more and devalue it to pay off the debts.
[01:47:16.758 --> 01:47:18.580]  Jordan Maxwell, final segment.
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:20.261]  I'm on his website, jordanmaxwell.com.
[01:47:20.461 --> 01:47:21.141]  It's amazing.
[01:47:21.161 --> 01:47:26.925]  Yeah, I've never seen this particular Army War College official strategic studies report.
[01:47:27.811 --> 01:47:28.752]  Release for the year.
[01:47:28.812 --> 01:47:30.493]  This is their battle plan, their prospectus.
[01:47:31.273 --> 01:47:32.594]  A world by 2010.
[01:47:35.756 --> 01:47:36.836]  The world in 2010.
[01:47:36.976 --> 01:47:41.879]  A new order of nations with a... The world is a cake and they're cutting it up.
[01:47:41.919 --> 01:47:42.580]  It's very funny.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:44.501]  They're cutting you up in the process.
[01:47:44.521 --> 01:47:50.644]  They'll just put an American flag on your face or tell you, oh, I'm... I'm Eric Prince from Blackwater.
[01:47:50.704 --> 01:47:51.685]  I'm a Christian.
[01:47:52.975 --> 01:47:58.579]  And the left hates him and thinks he's a Christian, and the right sees the left attacking him and thinks, oh, he must be a conservative.
[01:47:58.619 --> 01:48:02.101]  Kind of like we call Barack Obama a communist, and the left sees that and loves it.
[01:48:02.401 --> 01:48:03.923]  Meanwhile, it horrifies conservatives.
[01:48:04.303 --> 01:48:06.824]  It's all about keeping you and your left-right false paradigm.
[01:48:07.245 --> 01:48:08.946]  But the people aren't breaking out of that.
[01:48:09.266 --> 01:48:13.789]  Let's take a few calls here in closing, and then let him have some closing comments with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:48:13.949 --> 01:48:15.671]  Let's go to Jim in Los Angeles.
[01:48:15.691 --> 01:48:17.932]  You can bring up any subject you want, Jim.
[01:48:17.952 --> 01:48:19.093]  I know you've been holding for a while.
[01:48:19.413 --> 01:48:19.993]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:48:20.013 --> 01:48:20.514]  You're on the air.
[01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:22.650]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:28.157]  I was just calling in regards to the Fitbit Lawden tapes that I know you've mentioned in the past.
[01:48:28.597 --> 01:48:32.182]  I actually work in the visual effects industry out here in Los Angeles.
[01:48:32.562 --> 01:48:36.147]  I'm not a producer or director, I'm actually on the computer making all the effects.
[01:48:36.607 --> 01:48:40.292]  And all I have to say is those videos are pretty horrible and they're
[01:48:40.808 --> 01:48:46.796]  I definitely think, from my trained eye, I definitely think that there is definitely some manipulation going on there.
[01:48:46.856 --> 01:48:50.680]  Remember the last one they put out that looked like something out of a video game?
[01:48:50.741 --> 01:48:52.102]  It was such a bad animation.
[01:48:52.122 --> 01:48:54.505]  It was clearly an insult.
[01:48:54.525 --> 01:48:58.650]  I mean, they do that on purpose, kind of like they announced number 2 in Al Qaeda was killed 14 times.
[01:49:00.032 --> 01:49:04.137]  Always announce the next month he was killed again and never retract the last one.
[01:49:04.598 --> 01:49:16.953]  And for those that don't know, Wired Magazine had this big top special effects guy look at it and the Intel Center that supposedly got the tape uploaded their logo in the same layer as the supposed Al-Qaeda layer.
[01:49:17.433 --> 01:49:19.256]  You've got this Adam Gadon guy who's
[01:49:19.856 --> 01:49:20.777]  Connected into U.S.
[01:49:20.817 --> 01:49:22.618]  intelligence, who's American Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:23.279 --> 01:49:26.822]  Jordan, why do they make the propaganda so obvious?
[01:49:26.882 --> 01:49:31.386]  I mean, is that to just throw it in our face, or to kind of dull our senses?
[01:49:31.466 --> 01:49:35.969]  I think it's just an in-house joke among the powerful people of the world.
[01:49:35.989 --> 01:49:42.595]  It's just an in-house joke that you can throw stuff in America's face and call them any name you want.
[01:49:42.695 --> 01:49:44.997]  Play them for fools, and they love it.
[01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:47.499]  The Americans are so stupid, they'll buy anything.
[01:49:47.844 --> 01:49:48.184]  I don't know.
[01:50:06.104 --> 01:50:08.126]  And so they're just playing us for fools.
[01:50:08.206 --> 01:50:10.207]  Man, Jordan, I'm going to steal that analogy.
[01:50:10.648 --> 01:50:11.528]  That is perfect.
[01:50:11.608 --> 01:50:12.069]  Exactly.
[01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:13.209]  They have the sword.
[01:50:13.229 --> 01:50:15.311]  You know, they stick a few barbs in our back.
[01:50:15.331 --> 01:50:17.453]  9-11 throws a barb to get us enraged.
[01:50:17.893 --> 01:50:19.874]  And then, you know, Oklahoma City's another barb.
[01:50:20.455 --> 01:50:22.777]  And then the war on drugs, which they're throwing the barb.
[01:50:23.077 --> 01:50:24.738]  And then we get all mad and crazy.
[01:50:25.058 --> 01:50:26.279]  They start imploding the economy.
[01:50:26.299 --> 01:50:33.825]  And then they just hold out the red cape with a sword and then just skewer us for the New World Order oligarchy sitting in the stands.
[01:50:34.005 --> 01:50:39.049]  And they know that they can do it because they've always done it and we've always reacted the same way.
[01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:40.991]  We always react the same way.
[01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:54.382]  We're just surprised and shocked and then we go on out and do our shopping and watch basketball and they know that now America's so far gone mentally and intellectually that they can say anything, do anything.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.506]  Listen, listen, I hardly ever, and I mean Jim I want you to finish in a moment.
[01:51:05.285 --> 01:51:10.149]  I have to admit, I bought a Beavis & Butthead CD at Best Buy like six months ago.
[01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:14.512]  I don't watch a lot of TV, but I like to buy stuff I saw 10-15 years ago.
[01:51:14.532 --> 01:51:20.036]  Plus, I know Mike Judge is a fan of the show, so I said, well, let me watch a Beavis & Butthead.
[01:51:20.056 --> 01:51:26.061]  So I'm on the treadmill today watching Beavis & Butthead, and I was watching Beavis & Butthead give a class report.
[01:51:26.881 --> 01:51:42.178]  And then I remember watching Real Class Reports and then watching Miss South Carolina and I realized that Beavis and Butthead's report, which is meant to be an example of low-grade moron idiots, they were more eloquent and intelligent than the average person.
[01:51:42.458 --> 01:51:43.960]  I know, that's incredible.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:54.929]  So I want to do a piece where I take Beavis and Butthead doing that report on the web and then compare it to Miss South Carolina and show how literally this is not a joke.
[01:51:55.609 --> 01:51:57.231]  Listen, Jim, we need people like you.
[01:51:57.591 --> 01:52:00.473]  You know, Mike Rivera is doing a great job as a special effects guy for Lost.
[01:52:00.513 --> 01:52:01.854]  He's helping us analyze videos.
[01:52:02.615 --> 01:52:05.518]  He's in Jason Bermas' upcoming film I'm making.
[01:52:06.298 --> 01:52:07.679]  Entitled, Fabled Enemies.
[01:52:07.779 --> 01:52:15.005]  You need to make a YouTube video, don't use your name, and just say, I'm a special effects guy, here's examples, and show people how it's a fraud.
[01:52:15.446 --> 01:52:18.868]  I mean, I've made videos like that, and I'm not even a special effects guy, I show people how it's a fake.
[01:52:19.849 --> 01:52:26.515]  But, you know, some of them are fake computer generations, others are a fat guy with the light turned down and the camera blurred, as you know.
[01:52:26.855 --> 01:52:28.076]  But, I mean, we need you to do that.
[01:52:28.096 --> 01:52:29.097]  We need you in the fight, Jim.
[01:52:29.944 --> 01:52:40.628]  Absolutely, I couldn't agree with you more and that's why I've jumped in the fight and that's why I've helped get, you know, you helped me wake up and then I've spread the message and I've gotten other people to wake up.
[01:52:41.289 --> 01:52:52.856]  And it, you know, I couldn't agree with both of you anymore that it's just a lot of the general public, unfortunately, they just don't have the capacity to understand, and that goes along with what I do for a living.
[01:52:53.237 --> 01:53:03.623]  We step out of the movie theaters and I try to explain to people the stuff that they just saw that I just worked on, and they don't understand that it was fake, no matter how fantastical and unbelievable it is that we watched.
[01:53:03.923 --> 01:53:04.264]  That's true.
[01:53:04.304 --> 01:53:04.464]  Exactly.
[01:53:26.327 --> 01:53:42.399]  I hear you, but I mean, whatever, that newest fake that came out six months ago, I mean, that is the same computer model that's even cheap that anybody can buy for like ten grand or so, last time I checked, and that's the model they use in films like Final Fantasy.
[01:53:42.659 --> 01:53:43.900]  I mean, it's that same model.
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:45.721]  They only have like ten guys.
[01:53:45.821 --> 01:53:53.767]  Alex, you'd be surprised how many people in Hollywood over at Universal, and especially Warner Brothers, have called me.
[01:53:53.787 --> 01:53:55.588]  They're professionals working the movies.
[01:53:56.007 --> 01:53:58.068]  They said, Jordan, we know what they're doing.
[01:53:59.228 --> 01:54:02.930]  We've been working on major, major movies, major television shows.
[01:54:04.131 --> 01:54:06.352]  People in the studios, they know what's going on.
[01:54:06.752 --> 01:54:09.613]  Well, I mean, yeah, I know a lot of folks in Hollywood, so do you.
[01:54:10.373 --> 01:54:17.937]  I know George Lucas and quite a few others, but the point is that you're absolutely right that they know this stuff.
[01:54:18.137 --> 01:54:19.537]  And by the way, our guests are so big.
[01:54:19.557 --> 01:54:20.658]  Bob Chapman last hour.
[01:54:21.538 --> 01:54:25.262]  Uh, Jordan Maxwell who has comic books and movies with all his stuff in it.
[01:54:26.043 --> 01:54:29.087]  I mean, I don't want to... I mean, you've done stuff for Disney, everybody.
[01:54:29.407 --> 01:54:33.191]  And our guests are so big, we don't even have time to tell you how big our guests are, folks.
[01:54:33.471 --> 01:54:34.653]  JordanMaxwell.com.
[01:54:34.893 --> 01:54:37.556]  Final call for him, Benny... No, no, uh...
[01:54:39.197 --> 01:54:41.258]  Well, I just have another caller to go to that was before Benny.
[01:54:41.618 --> 01:54:41.878]  You know what?
[01:54:41.898 --> 01:54:43.138]  I don't think we're going to go to any more calls.
[01:54:43.158 --> 01:54:45.819]  I'm sorry to all the callers, but we're just out of time here.
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.380]  And now that I look at the clock, we've got four minutes left.
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.721]  I apologize, but that's it for calls.
[01:54:50.241 --> 01:54:54.022]  Jordan Maxwell, in closing, what can humanity do?
[01:54:54.382 --> 01:54:57.563]  Start questioning, start questioning the information they're being fed?
[01:54:57.603 --> 01:55:03.945]  I mean, what can we do to try to avert and get out of this global fascist dictatorship we're going into?
[01:55:03.966 --> 01:55:08.227]  Well, I think the scripture is the answer that we're
[01:55:08.655 --> 01:55:14.277]  The Bible has Jesus saying, go into your inner chamber, talk to the Spirit, talk to God, so to speak.
[01:55:14.898 --> 01:55:16.138]  It works.
[01:55:17.479 --> 01:55:37.747]  I believe that if we need to turn to our spiritual beginnings, just turn off the television and just understand the entire thing was made for you to manipulate your thinking.
[01:55:38.528 --> 01:55:51.872]  And stop buying into all the religious silly nonsense, the fascist, Nazi stuff that's being promoted out there as religion, and start using your head.
[01:55:51.972 --> 01:55:54.212]  Go to a library and read and study.
[01:55:54.272 --> 01:55:58.053]  I get so many people asking me, well, what can you tell me about this?
[01:55:58.113 --> 01:55:59.534]  What can you tell me about that?
[01:55:59.994 --> 01:56:03.995]  And I'm saying, why don't you just go to the library and look up the subject yourself?
[01:56:04.668 --> 01:56:05.808]  Instead of coming to me.
[01:56:05.888 --> 01:56:06.909]  That's how I got it.
[01:56:07.009 --> 01:56:10.330]  I just spent my whole life reading and studying and researching.
[01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.890]  Absolutely.
[01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:11.490]  Anybody can do it.
[01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:12.151]  Absolutely.
[01:56:12.171 --> 01:56:13.411]  Let's jam in one call.
[01:56:13.651 --> 01:56:15.032]  You got 30 seconds, Forrest.
[01:56:15.372 --> 01:56:16.752]  Forrest in California, go ahead.
[01:56:17.432 --> 01:56:18.053]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:18.393 --> 01:56:24.835]  I can tell that you, Alex Jones, and Jordan Maxwell are Americans who love this country very much.
[01:56:25.415 --> 01:56:31.117]  And I believe that through radio, we're actually creating a ritual where we understand
[01:56:33.514 --> 01:56:44.043]  Well, I hope that's the case, but I mean, you know, past energy or whatever.
[01:56:44.523 --> 01:56:49.007]  I'm just about getting people to realize, how many times has government corporations lied to you?
[01:56:49.407 --> 01:56:50.949]  How many times have you been conned?
[01:56:51.449 --> 01:56:54.011]  And that's just the stuff you know about and it's getting worse.
[01:56:54.091 --> 01:56:54.712]  It's out of control.
[01:56:54.952 --> 01:57:07.005]  The last thing I would say is quickly is I've got a lot of information, stuff on the downloadables, all kinds of information on the links page, even on the homepage.
[01:57:07.085 --> 01:57:11.170]  JordanMaxwell.com and Jordan, hopefully we can have you back in the near future.
[01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:13.292]  Thank you for spending time with us on this Sunday.
[01:57:13.312 --> 01:57:13.873]  Jordan Maxwell.
[01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:14.213]  Thank you.
[01:57:14.493 --> 01:57:14.854]  Take care.
[01:57:14.874 --> 01:57:15.915]  There goes Jordan Maxwell.
[01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.390]  Ah!
[01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:18.631]  That was a crazy show!
[01:57:18.651 --> 01:57:23.055]  We're kind of, you know, getting into some of the wilder topics, get people thinking outside the box.
[01:57:23.075 --> 01:57:24.617]  That's always healthy.
[01:57:24.657 --> 01:57:28.061]  My new film, Truth Rising, how 9-11's an inside job, totally documented.
[01:57:28.581 --> 01:57:30.003]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:57:30.023 --> 01:57:30.543]  Be sure and get it.
[01:57:30.563 --> 01:57:32.325]  We'll see you next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:57:32.365 --> 01:57:34.607]  And I got big guests coming up this week on the weekday show.
[01:57:34.948 --> 01:57:35.748]  Take care, folks!
[01:57:35.788 --> 01:57:36.729]  Great job, crew!
