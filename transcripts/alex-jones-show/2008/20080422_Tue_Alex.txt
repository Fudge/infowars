[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.731]  I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.877]  You ever love someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna break in two?
[00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.019]  I didn't think so.
[00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.101]  You ever try with all your heart and soul to get your lover back to you?
[00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:47.282]  I wanna hope so.
[00:00:47.703 --> 00:00:51.265]  You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch her walk away?
[00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:08.431]  Yeah, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms did a bad, bad thing to Celica Stillo, the third Vietnam veteran of the Army, a sniper.
[00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:12.492]  Then he worked as a police officer, sheriff's deputy on the border with the Border Patrol.
[00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:17.954]  Then he was a DEA agent, the most highly decorated and the commander down there in Latin America.
[00:01:18.014 --> 00:01:22.715]  Witnessed cocaine dealing, shipments by our own CIA at El Pango.
[00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:23.876]  We're good.
[00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:58.317]  Launder the money properly like they are supposed to do through the big central banks.
[00:01:58.377 --> 00:02:00.298]  If they don't, they then get pinched.
[00:02:01.198 --> 00:02:03.999]  In fact, just look at the great job making the film JFK.
[00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:08.641]  That's why if you watch the movie Scarface, he did five years of research.
[00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:14.563]  Mr. De Palma that wrote it, and of course with Oliver Stone who directed it.
[00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:15.596]  I think so.
[00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:36.759]  He is in the film that is on your screen.
[00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:53.095]  I forgot to tell listeners out there who are listening on the AM and FM dial and on the internet at InfoWars.com that we're going to start the video cam feed 30 minutes early in the third hour, not just the fourth hour today, but never fear, PrisonPlanet.tv members, this will be archived a few hours after the show today.
[00:02:53.615 --> 00:03:03.943]  And so you'll be able to go up there and watch the hour and a half interview, or hour interview, and then my news blitz at the last 20-30 minutes with Selly Costello III today.
[00:03:04.323 --> 00:03:11.228]  And so the live video cam, the document cam, our guest cam, the cam on me, the video feed cam, we have five different feeds in here.
[00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.230]  That is all live right now.
[00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.492]  Selly is a big part of the new film, American Drug War.
[00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:20.515]  He consulted on the film, American Drug War, that's on your screen.
[00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:22.477]  As I did.
[00:03:22.497 --> 00:03:32.202]  I am in the extras, according to my own recommendation that I not be the voice over for this, but I am in a big part of the three hours of extras that are in the film.
[00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:36.265]  And so another reason to get it from Infowars.com.
[00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:40.107]  It isn't even available in stores yet until May 24th.
[00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:42.528]  Well, we have it discounted by $5 out of the gates.
[00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.654]  I consulted for free as long as I could get the film first and so that is why we have it before anybody else does.
[00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:51.976]  American Drug War, The Last White Hope.
[00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:58.562]  When they raided him and set him up, they said, oh, big star on TV, you know, and made a big point of that.
[00:03:58.602 --> 00:04:00.123]  This is just political persecution.
[00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:05.648]  He's been told by different DAs, different prosecutors, that he was going to be politically punished.
[00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:08.250]  Selly, thank you for coming in the studio with us.
[00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:12.657]  Well, it's a great honor to have you here, Sully.
[00:04:13.277 --> 00:04:21.446]  Thank you, thank you, and I certainly hope that the American people will get an education on what's really going on with the government today.
[00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:28.725]  Now, I want to talk about what happened with your case, and I want to talk about where it's going.
[00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:39.031]  You've been indicted, and I haven't even talked to you yet about what happened this week when they were going to go ahead with the proceedings, so I want to discuss that with you.
[00:04:41.673 --> 00:04:42.893]  We're good to go.
[00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:09.723]  Well, basically what happened was that for the past year or so, there was an individual who was selling me guns.
[00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:17.710]  You know, he'd buy them and he would sell them to me and I would buy them and I would resell them at the gun shows.
[00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.713]  And basically what happened was I found out that
[00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:42.965]  It was against the law if I gave money to somebody or loan money to somebody to buy guns and that was a clear violation of the law and basically the individual that bought those 30 or 35 guns basically broke every law there is to be broken and yet he was never arrested.
[00:05:43.525 --> 00:05:47.248]  And I called a selective prosecution because they basically target me.
[00:05:47.328 --> 00:06:01.360]  And there's a history to show that I've been forewarned that an assistant United States attorney out of the McAllen office, a total defense attorney, for me to watch my back because they were going to come back to me and they were going to get me one way or the other.
[00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:03.202]  That's because you've testified as an expert witness.
[00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:03.723]  Exactly.
[00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:09.848]  I've testified on the corruption that the government has conducted, the outrageous government conduct that they developed during the case.
[00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:24.077]  The perjury before the agents, before grand juries, and I exposed all that and now we also have exposed that there have been some transcripts that have been changed, or maybe as they say.
[00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:32.122]  So all this information that I've obtained within the past few years has come back to bite me in the butt for exposing it.
[00:06:32.222 --> 00:06:33.943]  And you had no criminal record before this.
[00:06:33.983 --> 00:06:38.986]  For listeners that don't know who you are, give them, I know you don't like to talk about yourself, but you've had quite a history.
[00:06:39.406 --> 00:06:42.449]  Exactly, you know, I come from a very patriotic family.
[00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:47.773]  American, to be an American was number one in my family, patriotic.
[00:06:48.874 --> 00:06:52.718]  My family served, you know, my uncles, everybody served in the military.
[00:06:53.338 --> 00:06:57.041]  And as the only son, I was told to go serve my country, pay my dues to my country.
[00:06:57.121 --> 00:06:59.323]  And I did, and I followed my dad's footsteps.
[00:06:59.363 --> 00:07:01.525]  He was in law enforcement, and so was I.
[00:07:02.406 --> 00:07:03.507]  He was also in World War II.
[00:07:03.547 --> 00:07:04.427]  He was in World War II.
[00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:06.389]  He was shot six times in the Philippines.
[00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.210]  He paid his dues, as they say.
[00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:17.956]  We continue to be proud Americans and we try to do everything that law-abiding citizens will do.
[00:07:19.417 --> 00:07:20.518]  You went to Vietnam?
[00:07:20.558 --> 00:07:22.299]  I went to Vietnam.
[00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:34.127]  I did what I did as an infantry sergeant and I was down there as an 11B Bravo as they say and spent my year in Vietnam, came back, went to school, got my degree and worked in
[00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:37.708]  As a police officer in the state of Texas, detective, sergeant, and so forth.
[00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:40.049]  So I've got over 20 years of law enforcement experience.
[00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.771]  I've never broken the law in my life, in my adult life.
[00:07:44.071 --> 00:07:46.472]  I've just never been arrested or anything like that.
[00:07:47.032 --> 00:07:54.916]  And then all of a sudden the government comes after me because I had, first of all, I think this was initiated with my expert witness.
[00:07:54.996 --> 00:07:59.678]  And secondly, when I tried to set up a sting operation against ATF a few months back.
[00:07:59.978 --> 00:08:01.279]  And you did that with the local news.
[00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:09.125]  In fact, you exposed, they did expose, that they were spying on everybody, violating their Fourth Amendment, with cameras rigged in there in the South Texas gun show.
[00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:10.005]  Exactly.
[00:08:10.045 --> 00:08:28.619]  What they were doing, they were filming the shows, and they were profiling people that were coming out of the gun shows, and they were entrapping them in trying to buy the guns that they just legally bought, and also they were going out to the people's residence after they bought the gun to find out if they still had that gun with them.
[00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:30.562]  And that's Gestapo tactics.
[00:08:30.622 --> 00:08:32.105]  You don't, you know, you don't profile.
[00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:33.728]  It's against a lot of profile.
[00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:38.497]  And yet the ATF was doing all these kinds of atrocities and nobody was stopping them.
[00:08:38.868 --> 00:08:40.950]  My experience with the DEA was something that I am not very proud of, number one.
[00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:46.134]  Number two, I believed that what I was doing, by placing my life on the line, that I would make a difference in preserving my country.
[00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:08.768]  And as it turned out, after twelve years with the DEA, my last six in Central America, found out that we were the enemy.
[00:09:08.888 --> 00:09:11.029]  We were the guys involved in the atrocities.
[00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:13.390]  We were the guys that were involved in drug trafficking.
[00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:27.754]  The CIA was heavily involved in drug trafficking with Posadas, Carriles, Oliver North, Felix, Rodriguez, all those Cuban exiles that were down there running this covert operation that was run by the White House during the Bush-Reagan era.
[00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.975]  Who blow up Olympic athletes in their off time.
[00:09:31.075 --> 00:09:31.596]  Exactly.
[00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:32.056]  Evicted.
[00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:32.976]  And not only that.
[00:09:33.036 --> 00:09:34.117]  And then blame it on other people.
[00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:52.186]  Yeah, well they, Luis Posadas, of course, was helped by Felix Rodriguez, a CIA operative, exiled Cuban, to come out and help him escape from prison and brought him to Central America and worked at Ilopongo Airport involving running drugs into the U.S.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.242]  Specifically, let's just hit the key points, because I want to get into your case, but I want people to understand the background on this.
[00:09:58.782 --> 00:10:04.104]  Specifically, key evidence that you witnessed yourself of government shipping the drugs en masse out.
[00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.025]  Exactly.
[00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:08.266]  There were large shipments of drugs coming into this country.
[00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:14.689]  Now, they were, Guatemala or Central America, I should say, was used as a trampling for drugs to go into the U.S.
[00:10:14.909 --> 00:10:20.311]  And I personally participated in refueling those clandestine airstrips
[00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:34.134]  uh... airplanes that were being refueled in uh... in central america and uh... you know they were shipped with uh... they had hundreds and hundreds of uh... kilos of cocaine and yet they were never being seized in the U.S.
[00:10:34.874 --> 00:10:36.534]  uh... and basically it was a C.I.
[00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:45.916]  code operation that was being run uh... to funnel uh... drugs and profits into the uh... contras in Nicaragua and of course a lot of the american uh...
[00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:50.731]  The agents that were involved were lining their pockets and going to Swiss bank accounts.
[00:10:52.202 --> 00:10:56.324]  Going to Swiss bank accounts, and now they're going to keep a safe celly from terrorism!
[00:10:56.864 --> 00:11:05.407]  And then it turns out that every one of these so-called Al-Qaeda individuals was admittedly CIA, used against the Serbs in the late nineties, used against Iran.
[00:11:06.007 --> 00:11:18.912]  These Wahhabis out of Saudi Arabia are our buddies, and that they weren't even involved in the attacks, but they play the part of that, and then release these tapes that are uploaded by the Intel Center that's run by all these former CIA spooks, with the video posting
[00:11:19.432 --> 00:11:23.496]  In the same layer, and experts have looked at it, mainstream news has reported it's staged.
[00:11:24.597 --> 00:11:28.841]  How do you think people in our government got to the point of being willing to carry out terror attacks?
[00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:33.045]  Well, it's basically what's happening now is that there's no shame.
[00:11:33.266 --> 00:11:37.830]  They're so bold in what they're doing, and yet they're trying to blame those third world countries.
[00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:43.235]  And I've always said that every major terrorist in this world
[00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:46.442]  Work for the United States government at one time or another.
[00:11:47.102 --> 00:11:51.544]  So we're the ones that are building this beast, as we call them.
[00:11:51.764 --> 00:11:54.205]  And it's to destabilize all these third world countries.
[00:11:54.325 --> 00:11:54.785]  Exactly.
[00:11:54.905 --> 00:11:59.147]  And we know where Bin Laden is, but we need him for this war.
[00:11:59.167 --> 00:12:01.028]  We've got the best satellite networks in the world.
[00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:06.390]  We could actually find out where he's at, but we need him as a reason to keep
[00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.654]  With this war going on, this atrocity that's happening now in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:12:11.035 --> 00:12:14.259]  Well, they're now claiming that 9-11 truth works with Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:15.356 --> 00:12:20.641]  Well, certainly, there's always going to be a spin put on by the government, and anything that they do... Why is it so ridiculous now?
[00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:25.225]  Well, because it's obviously that what they're telling us is not true.
[00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:37.135]  It's obviously that, or bold as I say, that they continue to feed American all these lies, when in fact
[00:12:37.816 --> 00:13:00.812]  The American people are starting to wake up a little bit, not that much though, just a little bit, and that's why we're having a response now of what happened the past eight years here with George W. And basically we're going to, come November of next year, we'll find out who's, you know, we're on the right track or not.
[00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.610]  I think we're going to find we're on the wrong track, but they'll at least have to act like they're changing.
[00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:07.733]  There's no doubt, though, this has been the black-op presidency.
[00:13:07.773 --> 00:13:09.214]  I mean, they've just gone wild.
[00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:15.938]  This is what the private guys that run our government, and the CIA and others, they just work for the big banks.
[00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:17.880]  I mean, this is who we're dealing with.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.021]  These are people who are destroying our country.
[00:13:20.462 --> 00:13:25.105]  Everything they're doing is to get rid of our country, and I just, how dare them say they're patriots?
[00:13:25.545 --> 00:13:32.735]  Exactly, and you know the same people, the same terror cell that I called that worked back in the 80's for the U.S.
[00:13:32.755 --> 00:13:34.897]  government are still at the White House.
[00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:42.047]  All those people that were involved in those covert operations are still running covert operations in Iraq.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.962]  Sally, I want to get into your case now.
[00:13:46.982 --> 00:13:50.204]  You were on with us early last week.
[00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:53.407]  Now there's been some new developments.
[00:13:54.428 --> 00:13:55.749]  Just to be specific,
[00:13:56.897 --> 00:13:58.958]  here with all of the listeners.
[00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:01.599]  It's a gray area with these straw purchases.
[00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:06.021]  You can go to a thousand gun shows and see people selling 20, 30, 40, 50 guns.
[00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:07.762]  They go out and buy the guns.
[00:14:07.802 --> 00:14:08.542]  They're collectors.
[00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:09.402]  They sell some of them.
[00:14:09.742 --> 00:14:11.723]  You got into this, you told me, because you're an author.
[00:14:11.803 --> 00:14:13.544]  You would go to the gun shows and sell powder burns.
[00:14:14.004 --> 00:14:14.724]  You're a veteran.
[00:14:14.744 --> 00:14:15.445]  You like guns.
[00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:17.726]  You're a retired police officer, DEA.
[00:14:18.826 --> 00:14:21.890]  And you're there just selling a few shotguns, handguns, things like that.
[00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:25.335]  You told the whole story about how, hey, you know, let's get into this.
[00:14:25.355 --> 00:14:25.976]  Hey, give me money.
[00:14:26.016 --> 00:14:27.258]  I'll get you good deals on guns.
[00:14:28.039 --> 00:14:30.021]  And how they selectively enforce on people.
[00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:36.009]  So when you say, well, I didn't know it was illegal, well, you know, the BATF, the scallywags they are, I mean, they just do what they want.
[00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:47.274]  And so I want to be clear that you're saying, okay, I'm guilty, but the guy that sold me these guns, you know, last time you said it's pretty obvious that he was setting you up.
[00:14:47.294 --> 00:14:48.235]  It's like Randy Weaver.
[00:14:48.575 --> 00:14:51.896]  They kept saying, please, I'll give you five times what the guns were if you just saw it off.
[00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:52.997]  Just take them.
[00:14:53.037 --> 00:14:54.757]  His kids were hungry and he said, okay, and did it.
[00:14:55.157 --> 00:14:57.498]  And it was all because he wouldn't snitch on locals.
[00:14:58.079 --> 00:14:58.959]  And this is all admitted.
[00:14:59.039 --> 00:15:00.840]  So they went ahead and just came up and killed his family.
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.881]  I mean, who are these guys in law enforcement?
[00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:11.925]  Because I know they're not all bad, but it seems more and more it's this attitude of, we run everything, we're the boss, and they really are just thugs who want to rule.
[00:15:12.085 --> 00:15:21.851]  Well, the problem that I foresaw when this occurred to me was the fact that those agents, a lot of them are Iraqi veterans.
[00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:26.173]  And golf veterans also from the Gulf War.
[00:15:26.773 --> 00:15:28.955]  And basically you can see it in their eyes.
[00:15:29.015 --> 00:15:36.639]  These guys are suffering from PTSD, I mean big time, yet they carry a gun and a badge, you know, just like I did, you know.
[00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:41.502]  And certainly that's poor judgment in their part and what they do.
[00:15:41.822 --> 00:15:50.127]  And right now if you go to a gun show, we have guys, we got half of the gun show that sells AR-15s without paperwork.
[00:15:50.687 --> 00:16:00.739]  And yet, they don't touch them, they don't do anything to them, and they know very well, but their whole purpose on this thing is to shut down the gun shows under the Second Amendment.
[00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:02.541]  We're losing those rights to bear arms.
[00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:05.324]  Yeah, so everything is only registered guns.
[00:16:05.404 --> 00:16:06.926]  Now, let's go back here.
[00:16:07.427 --> 00:16:10.330]  People think PTSD means you lay on the ground and can't get up.
[00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.650]  No!
[00:16:11.431 --> 00:16:21.500]  It means that you stay active and aggressive and look for fights and look for excitement, and then if you don't have that excitement, you then get totally exhausted.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.303]  And I'm not saying I have it, but it's similar to being really working hard.
[00:16:24.523 --> 00:16:27.446]  If I go on a week-long vacation, I feel like somebody beat the hell out of me.
[00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:32.871]  Because I have to keep working all the time, and a lot of these cops, you see them, they're out of their minds.
[00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:37.355]  Because it is a stress, more alcoholism, more suicide, you know, everything.
[00:16:37.555 --> 00:16:42.640]  Yeah, you know, that's the problem, you know, that we, PTSD cannot be cured, number one.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.385]  Number two, I've been certified by the Department of Justice when I worked for the DEA that I have severe PTSD.
[00:16:50.226 --> 00:16:55.151]  And from my veterans, being a Vietnam veteran, the same thing, I've been certified as having major PTSD.
[00:16:55.171 --> 00:16:59.394]  And that's why you kept looking for the action of raiding coca fields, raiding facilities.
[00:16:59.514 --> 00:17:01.957]  Right in the edges, they say, you know, trying to...
[00:17:03.658 --> 00:17:09.566]  Yes, and you know I was putting my life on the line and I really thought that one time that I was actually doing it.
[00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:21.917]  for my country and which i was but the majority i was still looking that's why when i left vietnam i went to law enforcement i was still looking for that bullet with my name on it you know and the guilt that we have.
[00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:23.579]  Well you also get addicted to the action.
[00:17:23.719 --> 00:17:35.748]  Exactly it's an addiction and uh... you know thank god that uh... one of the things that has saved me a lot was the fact that i don't drink or do drugs but my medication was uh...
[00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:37.349]  Having a sense of humor.
[00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.071]  And that's what kept me going.
[00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:44.757]  But yet, it's so depressing right now that what happened to me that I felt, well, what did I go wrong in my world?
[00:17:44.797 --> 00:17:45.918]  Well, Sully, you gotta beat them.
[00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:48.461]  I mean, good guys always get targeted.
[00:17:48.481 --> 00:17:51.464]  We're gonna talk about trying to support you and help you on the other side.
[00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:52.605]  The fourth hour is coming up.
[00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:55.728]  You can see the video right now if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:17:56.229 --> 00:17:57.831]  We'll be right back with Sully Costello.
[00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:05.731]  Okay, Shelly, it is a big four members out there.
[00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:07.853]  We're just going to continue with the screen.
[00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:13.396]  You know, this is not FCC censored now.
[00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:14.637]  You can talk about whatever you want.
[00:18:16.358 --> 00:18:19.760]  I mean, just bottom line, are you pissed off at these guys?
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.540]  Absolutely.
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.142]  I am so pissed because, you know, we're all veterans.
[00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:25.883]  And those guys were veterans too.
[00:18:26.203 --> 00:18:28.424]  And I'm pissed off because I was targeted.
[00:18:29.824 --> 00:18:36.608]  They lie to me about a lot of things which I thought maybe a professional courtesy you would be a professional about what you're doing.
[00:18:37.428 --> 00:18:38.929]  And the bottom line is they didn't.
[00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:40.890]  Now they have offered me a plea bargain.
[00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:46.733]  The plea bargain is that they want to know all the crimes I have committed in my life.
[00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:49.975]  They want me to testify on whoever I gave the guns to.
[00:18:50.415 --> 00:18:59.760]  They want me to lie and perjure myself in the sense that if they don't like my answer, they can charge me with perjury.
[00:19:00.407 --> 00:19:03.168]  And then they wanted me to play up to 33 months in jail.
[00:19:03.589 --> 00:19:04.389]  You know what happens?
[00:19:04.849 --> 00:19:09.272]  It's not about doing the time, but it's the fact that I lose all my benefits if I go to jail.
[00:19:09.952 --> 00:19:10.232]  You know?
[00:19:10.512 --> 00:19:19.617]  And how is it possible that the government is asking me to sign a plea agreement when they know that I am severe on PTSD?
[00:19:19.837 --> 00:19:21.318]  Well, I want to talk about this more later.
[00:19:21.338 --> 00:19:23.459]  In mainstream news in California,
[00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:29.946]  He's admitting that one million police and their families, one million drivers, are literally above the law.
[00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:31.027]  They're allowed to drink and drive.
[00:19:31.068 --> 00:19:31.868]  They don't get tickets.
[00:19:33.069 --> 00:19:37.331]  But as soon as a cop does something good, or as soon as you fight evil, now they throw the book at you.
[00:19:37.791 --> 00:19:38.211]  Exactly.
[00:19:38.471 --> 00:19:40.672]  So you get special treatment as long as you go along with the evil.
[00:19:41.372 --> 00:19:44.214]  Exactly, and that's called professional courtesy, according to them.
[00:19:44.374 --> 00:19:54.518]  You know, you get stopped, whether you're DWI or DUI or whatever, and a lot of times, the blue coat, you take care of your own.
[00:19:55.519 --> 00:20:11.322]  uh... game a ride home and do whatever you want to do but that that that's backfiring on a lot of them because you know as you know law enforcement has the biggest divorce rate the biggest alcoholism and so forth and that's why it's called a tarnish badge because of all these atrocities that happen with them
[00:20:11.787 --> 00:20:12.288]  Absolutely.
[00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:17.493]  We're about to go live again with all of the regular radio listeners out there.
[00:20:17.513 --> 00:20:26.641]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv members right now are able to see the video of all of this and we then archive this each day for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:20:26.681 --> 00:20:28.323]  Celia, I'm going to come back and plug some sponsors.
[00:20:29.003 --> 00:20:30.865]  At the end of the third hour, we're going to start the
[00:20:31.886 --> 00:20:33.187]  Fourth hour now on the network.
[00:20:33.547 --> 00:20:34.828]  This is our second day of doing that.
[00:20:35.448 --> 00:20:38.549]  And we're going to get into how folks can support you, where this fight's going.
[00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.292]  We can also thank the folks that did support you in your fight just a few days ago.
[00:20:43.312 --> 00:20:48.355]  Again, we're going to go ahead and go back into regular transmission with the network.
[00:20:48.375 --> 00:20:51.316]  A little bit of the behind the scenes here for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.

[00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:00.701]  Protect your family.
[00:21:10.051 --> 00:21:12.533]  Well, nobody can say I'm not living my life to its fullest.
[00:21:12.553 --> 00:21:15.336]  Nobody can say that I was squeamish or that I didn't have an effect.
[00:21:15.776 --> 00:21:20.741]  And I know you listeners out there are having a great effect, too, and I salute each and every one of you.
[00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:26.267]  Every one of you out there is just fabulous and we love you.
[00:21:27.483 --> 00:21:30.264]  We're about to start the fourth hour that's going on many of our A.M.
[00:21:30.284 --> 00:21:30.545]  and F.M.
[00:21:30.565 --> 00:21:32.786]  affiliates simulcasting on W.W.C.R.
[00:21:33.346 --> 00:21:36.188]  and the internet at Infowars.com.
[00:21:36.628 --> 00:21:46.173]  If you are a presentplanet.tv member you will be able to watch the fourth hour here with the guest cam and the document cam
[00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:52.058]  And the DVD cam, where we can play you audio clips, video clips, computer clips, and a lot more.
[00:21:52.679 --> 00:22:05.550]  Before we continue with Selle Castello and how he's been set up, I also want to talk to him about this, what we believe is a murder of Riyad Hamad here in Austin, Texas, a Palestinian activist bound and gagged, thrown in the river.
[00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:10.195]  I want to encourage everybody out there to support our sponsors.
[00:22:10.716 --> 00:22:22.809]  If you go to InfoWars.com, there is a banner that says, Aloe Ease Body Cleanse, Aloe Vera, really good for flushing out your system, making you lose weight, detoxifying your GI tract.
[00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:25.892]  A lot of people get cancer because all the toxins we eat build up there.
[00:22:26.272 --> 00:22:28.953]  Great sponsor, Aloe, Yeast, Colon, and Body Cleanse.
[00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:32.295]  There's a link to New Vitality with the hundreds of fabulous products.
[00:22:32.475 --> 00:22:36.597]  This is one of the biggest, most respected mainline vitamin supplement companies out there.
[00:22:36.978 --> 00:22:38.498]  We're very honored to have them as sponsors.
[00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:44.361]  You can go to their website by linking through at InfoWars.com to NewVitality.com.
[00:22:45.822 --> 00:22:46.583]  We're by calling 1-800-569-4056.
[00:22:46.603 --> 00:22:46.743]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:53.588]  One of their other great products is Super Beta Prostate.
[00:22:53.929 --> 00:22:57.031]  These are well-known herbs for shrinking the prostate, giving you better health.
[00:22:57.352 --> 00:23:00.054]  Even a lot of doctors are now prescribing these herbs for prostate.
[00:23:00.554 --> 00:23:01.375]  That's medical doctors.
[00:23:01.395 --> 00:23:01.535]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:23:01.635 --> 00:23:07.640]  The well-recognized, well-documented, proven herbs and remedies.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.541]  That's what they've got.
[00:23:10.441 --> 00:23:12.322]  NewVitality.com or 1-800-569-4056.
[00:23:12.662 --> 00:23:20.306]  And in closing for this hour, we can't do anything we do here without your support.
[00:23:20.386 --> 00:23:24.428]  We can't do anything on this radio show without your financial support.
[00:23:24.689 --> 00:23:27.170]  And that's why you need to get American Drug War from us.
[00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.931]  It's not available anywhere else right now.
[00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:33.994]  It is available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:23:34.054 --> 00:23:34.334]  This proves
[00:23:38.556 --> 00:23:40.938]  How alcohol and other things kill hundreds of thousands.
[00:23:41.018 --> 00:23:42.199]  Marijuana, no one.
[00:23:42.499 --> 00:23:44.241]  It proves how the government is shipping in drugs.
[00:23:44.581 --> 00:23:46.663]  It proves how they selectively enforce things.
[00:23:46.683 --> 00:23:50.746]  Went for Tommy Chung while he smoked pot with Schwarzenegger, the Nazi pig.
[00:23:51.126 --> 00:23:52.567]  I mean, it's just such an incredible film.
[00:23:52.647 --> 00:23:53.528]  I consulted on it.
[00:23:53.928 --> 00:23:55.710]  And as you can see, I'm on the back cover.
[00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.633]  Alex Jones, Celica Stillo, Robert, Mike Rupert, Robert Steele.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:08.265]  Danny Danko of High Times, Medical Marijuana with Dr. Jensen, and so many others.
[00:24:08.685 --> 00:24:11.608]  This is a very, very important film.
[00:24:11.948 --> 00:24:13.850]  American Drug War, The Last White Hope.
[00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.433]  Also, the new film, Washington, You Are Fired, is out.
[00:24:17.753 --> 00:24:20.855]  It is part two to America, freedom to fascism.
[00:24:21.296 --> 00:24:23.418]  I hope everyone will get it as well.
[00:24:23.578 --> 00:24:24.719]  It needs to be seen.
[00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:26.100]  It needs to be gotten out.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.142]  We are allowed to fire these people.
[00:24:28.402 --> 00:24:29.703]  We are allowed to kick the government
[00:24:30.023 --> 00:24:30.724]  Out of our lives.
[00:24:30.744 --> 00:24:35.128]  I also want to ask listeners to support all of our AM and FM affiliates by supporting their sponsors.
[00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:38.872]  Support everybody that sponsors this show.
[00:24:38.932 --> 00:24:42.256]  We couldn't do it without them and we can't do it without you, the listeners.
[00:24:42.897 --> 00:24:44.198]  We're about to start the fourth hour.
[00:24:44.939 --> 00:24:51.345]  Everybody on the radio network can listen or again watch us online at PrisonPlanet.tv when this show becomes a TV show.
[00:24:51.926 --> 00:24:52.887]  We're streaming right now.
[00:24:52.967 --> 00:24:56.511]  But Selly, in the minute we've got left in this hour, give out your Powder Burns website.
[00:24:56.971 --> 00:24:59.353]  You are basically broke right now as a school teacher.
[00:24:59.754 --> 00:25:00.895]  You and your family.
[00:25:02.216 --> 00:25:03.698]  Powderburns.org.
[00:25:03.878 --> 00:25:05.840]  People need to go there, buy your book Powder Burns.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.121]  It's almost out of print.
[00:25:07.522 --> 00:25:08.162]  Excellent book.
[00:25:08.463 --> 00:25:11.566]  They need to make contributions to you or you're going to go to prison.
[00:25:12.782 --> 00:25:15.623]  I need some monies to pay my attorney.
[00:25:15.703 --> 00:25:18.404]  And guys, you can email me or send me a check.
[00:25:18.444 --> 00:25:23.245]  My address is on my email address powderburns at prodigy dot net.
[00:25:23.685 --> 00:25:26.666]  Or you can actually call me and I'll give you the information.
[00:25:26.686 --> 00:25:28.086]  956-345-5770.
[00:25:28.566 --> 00:25:31.307]  Once again, 956-345-5770.
[00:25:31.347 --> 00:25:35.368]  We're going to get that out again next hour.
[00:25:35.448 --> 00:25:37.329]  But Selly is on the front lines for you.
[00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:39.589]  We've got to support him, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:41.110]  We'll be right back with a fourth hour.
[00:25:43.831 --> 00:25:48.672]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:25:55.074 --> 00:25:58.515]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:25:58.675 --> 00:26:00.515]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:26:01.136 --> 00:26:03.876]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:26:04.176 --> 00:26:09.578]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:26:09.898 --> 00:26:13.860]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:26:55.701 --> 00:26:57.601]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:26:58.082 --> 00:27:00.843]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:15.047 --> 00:27:20.790]  Shelly Costello III, PowderBurns.org is our guest for another 30 minutes and I've got a huge news blitz coming up.
[00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.491]  Sorry, no calls today.
[00:27:24.372 --> 00:27:26.854]  But I think we're going to have open phones quite a bit throughout the week.
[00:27:26.874 --> 00:27:30.976]  We've got some huge guests coming up this week though, but believe me, the news, you've got to stay with us for that.
[00:27:32.137 --> 00:27:43.003]  I want to get Shelly as a former police officer, former army sniper, former DEA agent who worked all sorts of hardcore cases in Latin America.
[00:27:44.292 --> 00:27:44.872]  in D.C.
[00:27:44.952 --> 00:27:45.773]  all over the U.S.
[00:27:46.313 --> 00:28:03.383]  I want to get his take on what happened to Raeed Hamad, who we now talk to the head of the Islamic Center, the biggest one in Austin where he went, where they washed his body, and he was cut up, tortured all over, beaten.
[00:28:04.023 --> 00:28:06.665]  They said when they brought him the body, guts were all hanging out.
[00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:08.286]  None of that is on the news.
[00:28:08.846 --> 00:28:11.008]  Just sliced open, torn open everywhere.
[00:28:11.368 --> 00:28:12.449]  And it's just like Gary Webb.
[00:28:12.709 --> 00:28:14.911]  They blow his jaw off and shoot him in the side of the head.
[00:28:14.931 --> 00:28:16.892]  And they say he committed suicide.
[00:28:16.912 --> 00:28:21.656]  You know, he told his friends at his last house that he came home and guys were climbing down his pipe drain.
[00:28:22.076 --> 00:28:24.278]  And the media spun it and said, oh, he lived in a one story now.
[00:28:24.978 --> 00:28:27.520]  Point is, we said a year before he did that it was a pipe dream.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:35.006]  His so-called friend, who he actually wrote about and said wasn't his friend, came out and said that, oh, it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head.
[00:28:35.406 --> 00:28:41.411]  Cop of the year, of course, Terence Yeakey, who brought out the people of Oklahoma City, who saw the BATF involved.
[00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:43.312]  He called his partner and said, Feds are following me.
[00:28:43.352 --> 00:28:44.133]  I got the files.
[00:28:44.493 --> 00:28:46.455]  They told him to turn the files in he had.
[00:28:47.355 --> 00:28:50.978]  He was tortured, stabbed, burned, electrical burns, two bullet holes in the back of the head.
[00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:58.601]  Well, basically what it is is they try to extract information from him, who he contacted and so forth, and by doing that they have to torture him.
[00:29:21.467 --> 00:29:32.596]  And then they'll kill him, and then basically the government runs the police, and the police are not going to go against the government, and it'll probably more than likely be ruled suicide.
[00:29:32.676 --> 00:29:43.124]  But when in fact the matter is that these things are continuing to happen for many, many years, there's a lot of cases all over the country where this has occurred, and continues to occur.
[00:29:45.569 --> 00:29:53.551]  And you described, in his case there's no note, he told no one, but in some cases there's even notes and it's come out later that they were killed and you described on air how that works.
[00:29:53.571 --> 00:29:58.993]  You walk in your house, they put you in handcuffs, they say here's your kids, we're gonna kill them if you don't write this down.
[00:29:59.353 --> 00:30:01.774]  Exactly, and basically I know of two cases
[00:30:03.374 --> 00:30:08.596]  That's actually what happened and they gave the guy to think about it and he actually thought about it.
[00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:23.921]  He was happy at the very end of what he was going to do because you know he was saving his family and he actually committed suicide by them forcing him to do that and he did that and sometimes they're forced to write a letter.
[00:30:25.662 --> 00:30:26.822]  And then it happens.
[00:30:26.843 --> 00:30:30.124]  And what happens is the government is good at doing that.
[00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:36.908]  And they do follow through on killing a member of his family, whether it's an accident or a drowning or something like that.
[00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:37.769]  But it does happen.
[00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:46.558]  Have you seen the movie The Shooter with Wahlberg, where the government's got the apparatus where they make you shoot yourself?
[00:30:47.058 --> 00:30:47.939]  Exactly.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.202]  I saw that a lot of times in Central America.
[00:30:53.383 --> 00:30:56.085]  Basically, ironically enough,
[00:30:57.185 --> 00:31:06.132]  Just recently in Guatemala, the guys in my book, his name is Victor Rivera, he was a Venezuelan advisor for the death squads in Salvador and in Guatemala.
[00:31:06.612 --> 00:31:13.518]  He was involved in kidnapping a lot of the military officers and getting money from them, but he worked for the CIA.
[00:31:13.958 --> 00:31:17.361]  He was paid by Jack McAvett as his case agent.
[00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:32.396]  in in central america and so literally he went to work for guatemala and the government of guatemala hired him as an advisor and he was involved in the shooting uh... in the investigation of two of the congressman from salvador that were killed in guatemala
[00:31:33.217 --> 00:31:36.040]  Bottom line is this guy just got whacked last week.
[00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:40.245]  I mean he, two cars pulled over next to him, just shot the hell out of him.
[00:31:40.985 --> 00:31:43.448]  But he knew so much and he was working for the CIA.
[00:31:43.488 --> 00:31:44.309]  Who do you think killed him?
[00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:47.512]  Well, it's probably the same government and the CIA.
[00:31:47.573 --> 00:31:49.655]  He became a liability and they whacked him.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.701]  And you know, he worked for so many years.
[00:31:53.142 --> 00:31:56.725]  If you work for the Central Intelligence Agency, you're usually protected.
[00:31:57.165 --> 00:32:02.550]  But when this happened, it comes to a point that this guy, we don't need him anymore.
[00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.150]  Good, stay there.
[00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.731]  It is a big idea.
[00:32:04.751 --> 00:32:09.115]  Let's continue in this segment with Shelly for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:32:09.756 --> 00:32:15.641]  Hey Paul, I forget, do just the PrisonPlanet.tv members get this audio too, or is this the audio we're sending out?
[00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:17.599]  On all streams.
[00:32:17.639 --> 00:32:18.039]  Good, good.
[00:32:18.059 --> 00:32:19.641]  I'm glad all the listeners get the audio.
[00:32:20.161 --> 00:32:24.585]  And again, if they want to be Prison Planet.tv members, they can go sign up and get the video as well.
[00:32:26.687 --> 00:32:33.713]  Sully, when we come back on air, I want to talk about your case more and give the number out, because we have some stations that are picking up the fourth hour already, I think about ten of them.
[00:32:34.614 --> 00:32:36.075]  In just the second day, it's really growing.
[00:32:36.756 --> 00:32:38.897]  Not sixty-something like the earlier show, but it's still big.
[00:32:38.917 --> 00:32:41.039]  I want to get you some financial support and talk about your case.
[00:32:42.452 --> 00:32:46.256]  Me, it's like, you know, you fight them and it's like you can't help it.
[00:32:46.336 --> 00:32:47.297]  I know they may kill me.
[00:32:47.337 --> 00:32:50.359]  They tend to get you a decade, twenty years later, they always come.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:58.647]  But it's just, it's almost like a peaceful thing because we've gotten into this evil situation because men didn't stand up and just someday the evil's got to stop.
[00:32:58.687 --> 00:32:59.988]  It just can't get worse and worse.
[00:33:00.869 --> 00:33:02.210]  And I just know that I'm committed.
[00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.992]  I'm too far down the road to stop.
[00:33:06.234 --> 00:33:07.495]  It's almost a sense of peace.
[00:33:08.115 --> 00:33:11.438]  I am a little angry sometimes, though, because I want to go on vacation.
[00:33:11.478 --> 00:33:12.559]  I want to think about other things.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.121]  Even if I'm on vacation, I can't quit thinking.
[00:33:16.337 --> 00:33:17.858]  I can't quit thinking about this.
[00:33:17.898 --> 00:33:19.419]  It's just how this evil is everywhere.
[00:33:19.459 --> 00:33:20.499]  How they do this.
[00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:23.020]  It's like they've robbed me of my life in a lot of ways.
[00:33:23.281 --> 00:33:25.202]  I'm not boo-hooing or saying I'm not happy.
[00:33:25.482 --> 00:33:26.262]  I'm actually happy.
[00:33:26.342 --> 00:33:33.326]  I just, now once you know about this evil and you learn more and more, you just, it's all you think about because you just want to beat them because they're so bad.
[00:33:33.526 --> 00:33:35.467]  And then they call us saps because we're good guys.
[00:33:36.107 --> 00:33:44.570]  Yeah, so you know, it's so sad because, you know, a long time ago, I took a note to protect the Constitution of the United States and its citizens.
[00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:46.891]  And there's no expiration date on that.
[00:33:47.311 --> 00:33:52.373]  So I continued when I worked with the DEA as a police officer trying to protect the citizens.
[00:33:53.013 --> 00:33:57.295]  And even when I exposed the corruption, I was still trying to protect the citizens of this country.
[00:33:57.935 --> 00:33:59.176]  And there's no turning point.
[00:33:59.796 --> 00:34:01.617]  You know, you committed yourself to this.
[00:34:01.657 --> 00:34:02.597]  This is your life work.
[00:34:02.617 --> 00:34:04.258]  This is what you're going to do for the rest of your life.
[00:34:04.658 --> 00:34:12.942]  And even if I end up in prison, I'm still going to continue to... my struggle against these atrocities that our government is occurring.
[00:34:13.263 --> 00:34:13.963]  And yeah, you're right.
[00:34:14.663 --> 00:34:16.584]  It's getting worse before it gets better.
[00:34:16.724 --> 00:34:17.845]  And I don't think it's going to get better.
[00:34:18.005 --> 00:34:25.588]  This is going to... I've never seen our government being so bold in what they're doing on their illegal activities.
[00:34:25.608 --> 00:34:26.449]  These atrocities
[00:34:27.029 --> 00:34:27.749]  We're good to go!
[00:34:48.235 --> 00:34:50.017]  And those that don't kill themselves become cops.
[00:34:50.057 --> 00:34:50.397]  Stay there.
[00:34:50.417 --> 00:34:52.179]  We've got to go live here in just a moment.
[00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:52.940]  We'll come right back.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.961]  Ladies and gentlemen, meeting the network right now.
[00:34:55.042 --> 00:34:56.123]  Dr. William Deagle at 888-212-8871.
[00:34:56.143 --> 00:34:56.183]  888-212-8871.
[00:34:56.203 --> 00:34:58.985]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:59.005 --> 00:35:00.146]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:35:18.633 --> 00:35:24.056]  Shelly and I were talking during the break about 18 veterans a day.
[00:35:24.116 --> 00:35:26.558]  I saw the federal study last week committing suicide.
[00:35:26.578 --> 00:35:29.399]  Those that don't commit suicide... See, in World War II they knew.
[00:35:29.419 --> 00:35:30.260]  In World War I they knew.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.922]  If you spend a year or 11 and a half months on average in a turb,
[00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:48.412]  You would have about half the people have problems for the rest of their life, major mental problems, because as tough as you are, really stressful, traumatic things, or even just a lot of hard work, and working 18 hours a day, which happens in combat, it changes you for the rest of your life.
[00:35:48.432 --> 00:35:57.859]  You're either a workaholic, either you keep having that, you know, getting yourself to work that hard, or you just basically fall apart, and
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:00.561]  There's some ways to try to work on it.
[00:36:01.202 --> 00:36:02.383]  Well, now they have them stay.
[00:36:02.403 --> 00:36:04.864]  Some of them are starting their fifth tour in Iraq.
[00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:05.485]  I mean, they know.
[00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:09.908]  No one has ever... Korea, World War II, Vietnam.
[00:36:09.948 --> 00:36:16.933]  I mean, catch 22, you had to fly 22 missions, and you still had more than a 60% chance of dying on your B-17s going into Germany.
[00:36:16.973 --> 00:36:17.653]  They can only do 22 missions.
[00:36:18.974 --> 00:36:22.737]  Okay, and it's called Catch-22, because yeah, only 22 missions, but you're probably going to die anyways.
[00:36:23.698 --> 00:36:39.292]  You know, that is the situation, and I never knew, I never even knew that my dad's dad was a B-17 gunner until he died, and then they, years later, dug open his almanacs with him in the plane, and photos, and letters, and all his buddies, and them getting shot up by the Germans.
[00:36:39.952 --> 00:36:41.474]  The family didn't even, he wouldn't even talk about it.
[00:36:41.894 --> 00:37:10.179]  and that was just twenty two missions over germany uh... so so my point is is that now they're coming home to be cops and they're just that their minds are completely fried uh... so i mean what would you have been like if you would have served five tours in vietnam well that that that would that's really horrible uh... to do that and yet the the army still uh... saying that it's okay that they'll they'll be okay and uh... of course it's not and the majority of the veterans that come back
[00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:12.099]  Want to go into law enforcement?
[00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:14.880]  Because they're still looking for that bullet with their name on it.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:15.660]  I did it.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:24.382]  I got out of Vietnam, went to school right away, became a police officer, detective sergeant, and then worked for the DEA for 12 years.
[00:37:24.882 --> 00:37:28.323]  And basically that's what we normally do.
[00:37:28.383 --> 00:37:31.584]  These ATF agents that arrested me, they're all veterans.
[00:37:32.044 --> 00:37:35.345]  One of them looks like he's really PTSD after serving 10 years in
[00:37:36.725 --> 00:37:40.846]  In the war, or in the military, in the United States Army for ten years.
[00:37:41.506 --> 00:37:45.907]  And you know, you can tell, you can see it in his eyes, you know, what the problem is.
[00:37:46.367 --> 00:37:51.789]  And you know, a lot of us are talking about the Iraqi veterans, but the bottom line is... What do their eyes look like?
[00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:53.449]  Describe that and then get back into that.
[00:37:53.509 --> 00:37:54.409]  The eyes are deep.
[00:37:54.429 --> 00:37:56.930]  They're a thousand mile eyes, they call them.
[00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.011]  You know, it's a big, you know, the guy is just really deep.
[00:38:02.372 --> 00:38:11.336]  Looking at you, whether he's listening to you or not listening to you, he's just, you know, a glaze in the eye that tells you right off the bat.
[00:38:11.776 --> 00:38:12.377]  And you know what?
[00:38:13.817 --> 00:38:17.019]  There were four suicides in Dallas.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.261]  Eighteen a day, you were going to make a point.
[00:38:20.481 --> 00:38:27.384]  Eighteen a day, and there were four this year in Dallas at the VA clinic, or psychiatric ward, in Dallas.
[00:38:27.444 --> 00:38:29.085]  So they had to close it down last week.
[00:38:29.305 --> 00:38:29.926]  Well, guess what?
[00:38:30.566 --> 00:38:32.827]  Three of the four were Vietnam vets.
[00:38:32.987 --> 00:38:34.648]  They hung themselves.
[00:38:34.828 --> 00:38:36.348]  58 years old, and one was 57, I think.
[00:38:36.368 --> 00:38:46.513]  One of them found him, and then he later went up there, rented a garage, put his truck back in there, closed the door, and committed suicide.
[00:38:46.793 --> 00:38:47.753]  So, Vietnam veterans... Why?
[00:38:47.793 --> 00:38:48.233]  You've got it.
[00:38:48.313 --> 00:38:48.874]  Why?
[00:38:48.914 --> 00:38:49.814]  Why does it drive them to do that?
[00:38:49.854 --> 00:38:54.416]  Well, because it's, you know, it's just, the older you get,
[00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:57.433]  The worst the PTSD gets on you.
[00:38:57.933 --> 00:39:00.297]  You know, you want to fight everybody.
[00:39:00.397 --> 00:39:01.598]  Everybody's against you.
[00:39:02.059 --> 00:39:03.781]  Emotionally, you're on medication.
[00:39:05.003 --> 00:39:06.105]  You can't sleep at night.
[00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:11.352]  Yeah, when ATF went into my house, I had guns in the doors of my house.
[00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:12.774]  I sleep with my door open.
[00:39:13.574 --> 00:39:15.556]  Because I want to see who's coming in.
[00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:17.898]  You can't hold a job.
[00:39:18.719 --> 00:39:21.582]  You're married two or three times.
[00:39:22.002 --> 00:39:25.185]  The signs are there.
[00:39:25.205 --> 00:39:27.567]  We're talking about those guys doing three tours, four tours.
[00:39:27.647 --> 00:39:28.228]  Well, you know what?
[00:39:28.308 --> 00:39:31.791]  I did six straight years in Central America training dead squats.
[00:39:32.332 --> 00:39:34.293]  Now tell me if that does not affect me.
[00:39:34.674 --> 00:39:35.314]  Of course it does.
[00:39:35.755 --> 00:39:36.656]  And then I come home.
[00:39:37.356 --> 00:39:47.118]  And, you know, I was talking to a group of veterans just last week and he said, you know, I feel so bad, so guilty because I got divorced and I wasn't there for my kids.
[00:39:47.638 --> 00:39:48.658]  And he said, you know what?
[00:39:48.818 --> 00:39:49.499]  Don't feel bad.
[00:39:50.059 --> 00:39:53.699]  It's worse if you're there with the family and you take it out on them.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.660]  And I have never, ever looked at that before.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.141]  And, you know, I apologize every time.
[00:39:59.221 --> 00:40:02.741]  I talk to my kids three, four times a day.
[00:40:03.361 --> 00:40:06.222]  I talk to them because I want to tell them that I love them and I care about them.
[00:40:07.132 --> 00:40:10.173]  I mean, if I ever leave this world, I want to make sure that they know that.
[00:40:10.453 --> 00:40:13.875]  And it's devastating for them right now, because I've always been there for them.
[00:40:14.455 --> 00:40:21.698]  That I'm not going to be there the next ten years because I'm going to be in prison because of what I believe in doing.
[00:40:22.278 --> 00:40:23.859]  Because the Second Amendment has to die.
[00:40:23.979 --> 00:40:24.439]  Exactly.
[00:40:24.819 --> 00:40:26.780]  So, you know, that's basically what it is.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.401]  And, you know, we're suffering.
[00:40:28.521 --> 00:40:29.561]  What is your lawyer saying?
[00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:30.542]  What is the battle plan?
[00:40:30.562 --> 00:40:31.442]  How do we help you, Sully?
[00:40:31.462 --> 00:40:33.463]  I mean, you said my listener sent you around a thousand bucks.
[00:40:33.703 --> 00:40:35.944]  That paid for half the lawyer just in last week's court.
[00:40:36.272 --> 00:40:48.260]  Exactly, you know, he's asking for $15,000 and I ended up with about $1,000 and I had to pay him that $1,000 to follow the motion not to show up for that hearing.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.842]  And, you know, I still need a lot of help.
[00:40:50.922 --> 00:40:59.347]  I know a lot of you, economic wise, it's very hard on everybody, the gasoline and so forth, but if you please send whatever... I had a lady send me $7.
[00:41:00.768 --> 00:41:02.991]  I had a young kid from high school send me $5.
[00:41:03.751 --> 00:41:08.036]  You know, that is great because, you know, people are getting educated.
[00:41:08.136 --> 00:41:10.459]  People are learning and the more you send the better.
[00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.245]  And prayers, I got over 50 letters, 50 prayers from people.
[00:41:15.325 --> 00:41:20.631]  As a matter of fact, I got a lady, I have no idea who she is, but she sent me this in the mail.
[00:41:21.508 --> 00:41:22.509]  And that's for me to wear.
[00:41:23.049 --> 00:41:24.250]  And you know, it's a coupler.
[00:41:24.651 --> 00:41:32.898]  And it is very important to those people that have actually sent me their prayers.
[00:41:33.038 --> 00:41:35.200]  I mean, I'm in their prayers every night.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:40.424]  And people, you know, just become believers in God Almighty.
[00:41:40.545 --> 00:41:41.846]  He'll be there for us.
[00:41:42.206 --> 00:41:43.027]  And I certainly hope.
[00:41:43.307 --> 00:41:45.649]  And if He doesn't, then there's a reason for it.
[00:41:46.089 --> 00:41:48.972]  And I just hope that everything turns out fine with me.
[00:41:49.272 --> 00:41:51.634]  Well, it's a really touching story, Sully.
[00:41:51.674 --> 00:41:52.695]  It's got tears in my eyes.
[00:41:54.217 --> 00:41:59.963]  And I want to talk about that because a lot of these guys that work for the evil, they're like caught up in a rat race.
[00:41:59.983 --> 00:42:00.964]  They're all stressed out.
[00:42:01.004 --> 00:42:01.764]  They're crazy.
[00:42:01.804 --> 00:42:03.006]  They believe the propaganda.
[00:42:03.046 --> 00:42:04.147]  It's about us against them.
[00:42:04.847 --> 00:42:05.949]  How do they do the evil?
[00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:12.695]  I've seen cops frame people all the time and all these squad car videos are coming out now because people are putting hidden cameras in their cars because they're so cheap.
[00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:14.036]  I think?
[00:42:36.663 --> 00:42:51.719]  Well, basically what it is, is these people here, these agents, it's a new generation now, before you used to have a little respect for the public, and now what it is, is that they think they're above the law, and a lot of times they are above the law, and basically
[00:42:52.459 --> 00:42:57.083]  They like to cut corners, to make cases, and that's how they get promoted.
[00:42:57.263 --> 00:43:03.788]  The more cases you build, the more people you arrest, the more drugs you seize, or guns you seize, that's how you get promoted.
[00:43:04.188 --> 00:43:05.969]  And so forth, and that's what they're looking for.
[00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.252]  And it's better to go after good citizens, because they don't tend to fight back as much.
[00:43:09.412 --> 00:43:09.853]  Exactly.
[00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:13.718]  And you know, they prey on the weak.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.962]  You know, the cartels.
[00:43:17.382 --> 00:43:22.969]  I asked the ATF agent, one of the guys that serves, I saw him at the gun show.
[00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.253]  I told him, I said, why don't you guys go after
[00:43:26.994 --> 00:43:30.998]  The American M-16s that are being sold to the cartels in Mexico.
[00:43:31.378 --> 00:43:32.299]  You know what he said to me?
[00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:39.505]  He said, well, you know what, that's our government selling it to other dirt world governments, and those dirt world governments will sell them to the cartels.
[00:43:39.525 --> 00:43:42.969]  Well, I was about to say, and that's who's shooting at the border patrol and the FBI and sheriff's deputies.
[00:43:43.189 --> 00:43:44.230]  But expanding on that,
[00:43:45.851 --> 00:43:51.354]  Bush wants to send $147 billion to the Mexican government to, quote, fight terror and drugs.
[00:43:51.614 --> 00:43:53.736]  That's to consolidate the drug dealing, isn't it?
[00:43:54.176 --> 00:43:54.636]  Exactly.
[00:43:54.956 --> 00:43:56.537]  It's all profits to, you know...
[00:43:58.351 --> 00:44:00.474]  The war on drugs has never worked.
[00:44:00.874 --> 00:44:02.476]  Enforcement has never worked.
[00:44:02.496 --> 00:44:03.717]  Well, it's worked to make more drugs.
[00:44:03.797 --> 00:44:04.859]  Well, yeah, it is.
[00:44:04.879 --> 00:44:07.001]  But it may not work the way they say.
[00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:13.168]  They're supposed to work, and yet Congress keeps funneling millions of dollars into the drug war.
[00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:16.032]  And we got more drugs today than we did 10, 15 years ago.
[00:44:16.392 --> 00:44:16.592]  Why?
[00:44:16.933 --> 00:44:17.493]  Because
[00:44:18.214 --> 00:44:24.459]  That's what they use us to get scared on our kids being on drugs and so forth.
[00:44:24.619 --> 00:44:26.260]  And, you know, it doesn't work.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.962]  We spend billions of dollars in search countries.
[00:44:29.262 --> 00:44:30.283]  We can't even make a dent.
[00:44:30.923 --> 00:44:38.449]  So basically, it's got to tell you that the answer's got to be treatment, prevention, and so forth, but not enforcement, because enforcement has never worked.
[00:44:40.228 --> 00:44:53.535]  Selly, I want to get into this article, and they have links to mainstream news articles, and if you Google this, you can go to the Transportation Authority in California, you can go to the news articles, where they're defending it.
[00:44:54.155 --> 00:44:55.476]  Out of the way, peasants!
[00:44:55.556 --> 00:44:57.877]  LewRockwell.com, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:44:58.358 --> 00:45:04.001]  They are a special class of people, basically exempt from the laws, because they're allowed to drink and drive, speed, not pay tolls.
[00:45:04.821 --> 00:45:08.562]  And it says that it's the law enforcement, other government agencies, and their families.
[00:45:08.602 --> 00:45:10.403]  They get special plates.
[00:45:11.904 --> 00:45:21.667]  And it goes into a 1978 program that started to protect the confidentiality of peace officers, so members of the public couldn't find their addresses on Department of Motor Vehicles.
[00:45:22.167 --> 00:45:26.229]  But it says over the years the program has been expanded from one set of government workers to another.
[00:45:27.485 --> 00:45:31.466]  And it just goes on to say that they are allowed to do whatever they want now.
[00:45:31.926 --> 00:45:35.987]  I mean, this is insane that we've gotten to this point, Sully.
[00:45:36.007 --> 00:45:36.688]  Can you speak to that?
[00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:38.528]  Yeah, there's no accountability.
[00:45:38.548 --> 00:45:45.090]  Right now we had a constable who used to work, well, that ran for a constable's position there in South Texas.
[00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:53.172]  He worked for DPS for many years and he finally got fired because of family violence.
[00:45:54.072 --> 00:45:54.733]  I think so.
[00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:20.994]  And thank God he lost, because, you know, can you imagine a guy like that going into more power, or being a constable, and abusing the citizens?
[00:46:21.034 --> 00:46:38.105]  Well, you're in this film, American Drug War, with Kevin Booth and everybody else, and you've seen the video of Sheriff Arpaio, and I mean, he literally drives his car into businesses, stumbling around, he looks like he's on something, and he's just, when you talk to him,
[00:46:39.025 --> 00:46:40.025]  I've seen raw footage.
[00:46:40.246 --> 00:46:41.866]  The guy is publicly insane.
[00:46:42.006 --> 00:46:42.867]  Well, you know why?
[00:46:42.927 --> 00:46:44.167]  Because he's a Vietnam vet.
[00:46:44.847 --> 00:46:46.288]  I don't know if you're aware of that.
[00:46:46.348 --> 00:46:48.068]  He is a Vietnam vet.
[00:46:48.229 --> 00:46:49.089]  And former DEA.
[00:46:49.269 --> 00:46:50.089]  And former DEA.
[00:46:50.249 --> 00:46:51.190]  And guess who else?
[00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.671]  Our presidential candidate.
[00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:55.051]  McCain.
[00:46:55.251 --> 00:46:57.972]  Stoppers from PTSD, but they will never bring it out.
[00:46:58.212 --> 00:46:59.433]  They say he's got a short fuse.
[00:46:59.873 --> 00:47:01.213]  No, it's his PTSD.
[00:47:01.353 --> 00:47:02.654]  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
[00:47:02.674 --> 00:47:03.174]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.975]  It is a big idea.
[00:47:06.775 --> 00:47:08.677]  Sally, we're going to continue talking here.
[00:47:09.417 --> 00:47:11.139]  We're still rolling, right, for everybody out there viewing?
[00:47:11.159 --> 00:47:12.280]  Good.
[00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:15.403]  Cutting out my own commercials for my own videos, talking about this stuff.
[00:47:15.423 --> 00:47:16.044]  It's so important.
[00:47:16.444 --> 00:47:21.829]  We're going to have about five minutes left when we get back, but Sally, PowderBurns.org, people need to support you.
[00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.792]  We'll plug that at the end in the book.
[00:47:24.812 --> 00:47:27.934]  PowderBurns, buy in the book, support you, whatever you can do, listeners.
[00:47:28.735 --> 00:47:29.736]  I really appreciate the listeners.
[00:47:29.756 --> 00:47:33.658]  I hate to come to you for this, but we're trying to support Selly and he's a great guy.
[00:47:33.738 --> 00:47:35.119]  He's taken a lot of risks doing this.
[00:47:35.139 --> 00:47:37.060]  He's been threatened, exposed to government drug dealing.
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:42.943]  When they arrested him, they brought up American Drug War, which he's a big part of and consulted on and in.
[00:47:43.884 --> 00:47:50.008]  But Selly, just in the three minutes we've got before we come back, there's a big audience listening right now on the web and watching us on the webcam.
[00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:51.789]  Any other points you want to add?
[00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:53.209]  No, certainly.
[00:47:53.229 --> 00:47:57.772]  I just hope that you guys continue to help me out financially.
[00:47:57.832 --> 00:48:02.435]  And your prayers, I strongly appreciate that.
[00:48:02.495 --> 00:48:07.157]  But it's going to be a time where letters are going to be submitted when I go to court.
[00:48:07.377 --> 00:48:10.719]  And, you know, the judge is supposed to be a very fair judge.
[00:48:10.759 --> 00:48:16.242]  And hopefully, and certainly hope that if he does, we have a letter campaign on letters.
[00:48:16.743 --> 00:48:19.965]  We'll get up there and have you guys send letters.
[00:48:21.326 --> 00:48:25.637]  I'm appreciating the fact that what I've done for you guys for the past years.
[00:48:26.826 --> 00:48:28.987]  Well, Shelly, we appreciate you.
[00:48:29.647 --> 00:48:33.249]  Do these cops in BATF, do they have any shame how they're setting you up?
[00:48:33.729 --> 00:48:34.489]  Absolutely not.
[00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:38.471]  They think I'm going to lay down and roll over for them.
[00:48:38.491 --> 00:48:40.131]  So they think it's another big win?
[00:48:40.672 --> 00:48:41.752]  It's another big win for them.
[00:48:42.072 --> 00:48:44.573]  And like I've said, to them, I was a big trophy.
[00:48:44.913 --> 00:48:46.714]  And they've been hunting me for quite a while.
[00:48:46.914 --> 00:48:53.617]  It reminds me of that big deer with the big stag horns on him that everybody's been after for so long and they finally got him.
[00:48:54.298 --> 00:48:55.698]  But he's wounded, not dead.
[00:48:56.058 --> 00:49:06.720]  So, you know, they think that... And it doesn't surprise me that they'll come back with more charges or my indictment just to put more pressure on me to plea out.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.861]  I'm going from memory, a week ago or so, but didn't they threaten you to plea or they'd stack more?
[00:49:11.241 --> 00:49:12.741]  Well, that's basically what happened.
[00:49:13.501 --> 00:49:19.402]  On the plea bargain, I had about 20 guns to it, and then all of a sudden, when I got indicted, it's 35 guns.
[00:49:19.442 --> 00:49:22.303]  They're charging me with every gun that that guy bought.
[00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.293]  You know, and there's no proof on a lot of those guns.
[00:49:27.454 --> 00:49:28.155]  You can't prove it.
[00:49:28.835 --> 00:49:29.976]  They're going back for a year.
[00:49:30.016 --> 00:49:31.838]  But again, it's not even illegal what you did.
[00:49:31.878 --> 00:49:33.239]  They selectively enforced it.
[00:49:33.259 --> 00:49:44.469]  They selectively enforced me, and yet there's people out there at the gun shows doing the same thing that they've been doing for years, yet they'll select people like me that are mostly ex-law enforcement.
[00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.292]  And to them, an ex-law enforcement is a big trophy.
[00:49:49.386 --> 00:50:13.038]  Well, it's like, I'm not saying you did anything wrong, but in another case, a guy that had running a private prison in Afghanistan where they torture people to death under orders, now the memos are public and Bush ordered it's public, and they were going to send the guy to prison, and the guy said, I've got the orders, and they seized him under Patriot Act, wouldn't allow him defense, and sent their own torturer to prison gagging him and not letting him defend himself under a terrorist statute, and now it's all come out.
[00:50:13.438 --> 00:50:16.360]  So here, you've done nothing in their, why do they love burning their own?
[00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:28.167]  Well, it's because they're trying to say that they're doing their own laundry in-house, when in fact, everybody, it's like toilet paper.
[00:50:28.247 --> 00:50:29.727]  They use you.
[00:50:29.807 --> 00:50:31.949]  You do the best thing you can for your country.
[00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:47.072]  You know, one of the things that I did that I'm not, you know, when I trained all dead squads, you know, I kept pictures, I kept documents, I kept journals, because that's going to be my defense of what they asked me to do for my government.
[00:50:47.732 --> 00:50:57.394]  And, you know, they can actually come back and prosecute me for that, and that'd be it, you know, but I have exposed them from the get-go, and I will continue to do the same thing.
[00:50:58.394 --> 00:50:59.455]  There will be no errors on this one.
[00:50:59.475 --> 00:51:01.095]  Okay, we gotta go back on air right now.
[00:51:01.155 --> 00:51:01.435]  Here we go.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:21.689]  Final segment with Selly Castillo, an intense news blitz for the final 30 minutes of the show coming up in the next segment.
[00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:28.498]  Selly, we're talking about how these guys feel good persecuting you and hopping things up against you, cooking them up.
[00:51:32.017 --> 00:51:38.360]  On a lighter note, what do you think of the final edition of American Drug War that's aired over 50 times on Showtime?
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.981]  The cops that set you up basically laughed about it.
[00:51:42.341 --> 00:51:43.542]  So that means it's getting out there.
[00:51:43.762 --> 00:51:46.903]  I'm hearing a buzz everywhere about the film.
[00:51:46.943 --> 00:51:48.124]  Give us your take on that.
[00:51:48.244 --> 00:51:52.166]  Well, it's an excellent tape not to blow my horn on because I'm in the
[00:51:53.486 --> 00:52:08.297]  The thing here, the DVD, but for the first time ever, we have the director of the DEA admitting that the CIA ran drugs back in the 80s from Central America.
[00:52:08.357 --> 00:52:17.603]  We had CIA agents, MacFarlane, out of Honduras, who shipped large quantities of cocaine, over a thousand kilos, to the U.S.
[00:52:18.424 --> 00:52:21.166]  to profit the covert operations being conducted by
[00:52:21.966 --> 00:52:26.732]  But the CIA, you know, Noriega, you know, everybody's admitting to the whole thing.
[00:52:26.772 --> 00:52:41.389]  Noriega's being denied a pardon, not a pardon, but a release from prison because George Harper Bush is scared that he might spill the guts, his guts out on what he knows of what he did with our government back in the 80s.
[00:52:42.435 --> 00:52:45.056]  Well, I hope people will get it at Infowars.com.
[00:52:45.096 --> 00:53:01.079]  It's not in stores until May 24th, but I have a deal with a filmmaker because I consulted on it, as you did, that we are selling it now at Infowars.com, or you can call 888-253-3139 to get American Drug War.
[00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:03.019]  It's got three hours of extras.
[00:53:03.039 --> 00:53:10.261]  You're going to have a master's degree on how they bring it in, how they control it, how it's a fraud, how prescription drugs kill a lot more, how alcohol
[00:53:11.081 --> 00:53:11.742]  That's right.
[00:53:29.917 --> 00:53:34.101]  One way people can support you and get your book, well you've got like 300, 400 copies left.
[00:53:34.401 --> 00:53:36.362]  When it's gone, it's out of print, powder burns.
[00:53:36.662 --> 00:53:39.565]  The story of the government dealing the drugs, you witnessing it.
[00:53:40.125 --> 00:53:41.726]  It's a read you can't put down.
[00:53:42.407 --> 00:53:47.110]  And if people will just buy it from you, that will help you try to pay for the lawyer and beat these people.
[00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:49.592]  That way they can donate and actually get something back.
[00:53:49.612 --> 00:53:50.333]  Can you comment on that?
[00:53:50.533 --> 00:53:51.154]  Absolutely.
[00:53:51.914 --> 00:53:52.795]  Every little bit helps.
[00:53:53.095 --> 00:53:53.936]  I've got about 300 copies left.
[00:53:56.357 --> 00:54:01.860]  You know, I do want to sell them so I can get my financial support from my attorney and my defense, my legal defense.
[00:54:02.901 --> 00:54:08.404]  And go to my website, PowderBurns.org, or you can email me directly at PowderBurns at Prodigy.net.
[00:54:09.024 --> 00:54:12.986]  Now to be clear, last week people had to call you or get your address to send you checks.
[00:54:13.707 --> 00:54:16.088]  Now you've got a donation, PayPal, at PowderBurns.org.
[00:54:16.368 --> 00:54:16.808]  Exactly.
[00:54:16.928 --> 00:54:25.011]  It's linked there and you can go straight to it and I'll ship you out the books and whatever donations.
[00:54:25.132 --> 00:54:26.912]  I always send a thank you card for it also.
[00:54:27.132 --> 00:54:28.733]  Yeah, I got a thank you card from you, Selly.
[00:54:28.753 --> 00:54:30.454]  By the way, I don't want thank you cards from you.
[00:54:30.914 --> 00:54:34.695]  You're too busy fighting for your life and your family right now and we appreciate your courage.
[00:54:34.735 --> 00:54:35.276]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:54:35.296 --> 00:54:37.777]  So just don't worry about sending me a thank you card.
[00:54:37.797 --> 00:54:38.557]  I got your thank you card.
[00:54:38.577 --> 00:54:39.197]  I appreciate it.
[00:54:39.457 --> 00:54:40.878]  In fact, it's right here on my desk.
[00:54:40.898 --> 00:54:41.358]  Look right here.
[00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.759]  Got Selly's thank you card right here.
[00:54:43.799 --> 00:54:45.980]  Very nice little thank you card.
[00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:47.401]  It's Powder Burns.
[00:55:09.652 --> 00:55:10.073]  I think so.
[00:55:27.209 --> 00:55:31.271]  Like I said, I got plenty of books and I still need a lot of financial help.
[00:55:31.692 --> 00:55:44.879]  And one real fast thing, I need somebody to donate a tractor trailer, a little riding lawnmower tractor, because I'm going to be doing a pilgrimage all the way from McAllen to San Antonio in protest with PTSD for veterans.
[00:55:45.519 --> 00:55:49.241]  And I'm trying to get an old tractor so I can ride it up here.
[00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:54.203]  It's going to take me three or four days and hopefully bring awareness to the veterans.
[00:55:54.223 --> 00:55:57.165]  You want somebody to loan you a farm trailer because it will get a lot of attention.
[00:55:57.185 --> 00:56:00.266]  Yeah, a little tractor trailer or riding lawnmower.
[00:56:00.506 --> 00:56:09.511]  Something that I can actually drive all the way from McAllen into San Antonio with a banner saying, you know, support the veterans with PTSD.
[00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:13.916]  Well, and they should go with you and support you and maybe videotape and put it on YouTube.
[00:56:14.076 --> 00:56:14.377]  Exactly.
[00:56:14.417 --> 00:56:15.098]  To bring attention.
[00:56:15.118 --> 00:56:16.460]  Well, Sully, give out your phone number.
[00:56:16.941 --> 00:56:17.482]  My number is 956-345-5770.
[00:56:17.522 --> 00:56:17.943]  Once again, 956-345-5770.
[00:56:25.444 --> 00:56:27.205]  Sully, I want to thank you for spending time with us.
[00:56:27.225 --> 00:56:28.366]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[00:56:28.386 --> 00:56:29.626]  It's an honor to be with you.
[00:56:29.666 --> 00:56:29.946]  You bet.
[00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:30.727]  Thank you, my friend.
[00:56:31.227 --> 00:56:38.291]  And we'll have Sully in every month or so as this case of political persecution intensifies.
[00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:43.053]  And they told him they were going to get him for his political activities here in the land of the cowards, home of the slaves.
[00:56:43.453 --> 00:56:45.434]  Hopefully we can change that back to what we once were.
[00:56:45.454 --> 00:56:48.116]  We've never been perfect, but we are very shameful today.
[00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:49.676]  But thank you for all your support of Sully.
[00:56:49.997 --> 00:56:51.057]  News Blitz straight ahead.
[00:56:51.157 --> 00:56:51.837]  Stay with us.
[00:56:51.857 --> 00:56:52.358]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:53.223 --> 00:56:54.124]  We're on the march.
[00:56:54.604 --> 00:56:55.325]  The Empire.
[00:56:55.465 --> 00:56:56.426]  Sally, thanks for coming in.
[00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:56.806]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:56.846 --> 00:56:57.387]  Thank you, man.
[00:56:57.427 --> 00:56:58.227]  Really appreciate it.
[00:56:58.347 --> 00:56:58.728]  Yes, sir.
[00:56:58.888 --> 00:57:00.189]  Really appreciate it, brother.
[00:57:00.249 --> 00:57:01.010]  Thanks, man.
[00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:02.791]  I'll come back to you and let you know.
[00:57:02.991 --> 00:57:03.412]  God bless.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.081]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[00:59:57.101 --> 00:59:59.742]  What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
[01:00:28.777 --> 01:00:31.003]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[01:00:31.464 --> 01:00:34.152]  What if I say I will never surrender?
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.280]  Yeah, Silica Stillo's a real hero.
[01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:42.321]  And he had commendations from two presidents.
[01:00:42.361 --> 01:00:43.981]  He was going way up the chain.
[01:00:45.161 --> 01:00:49.002]  And then he's witnessed the death squads, the people he was training, the government drug dealing.
[01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.482]  He wrote letters to the presidents.
[01:00:50.982 --> 01:00:52.122]  He was told to shut up.
[01:00:52.863 --> 01:00:54.643]  It's like Terry Reid in the CIA.
[01:00:54.683 --> 01:00:57.603]  He was just mid-level training pilots and kind of running part of the airport.
[01:00:58.123 --> 01:00:59.424]  And they'd be unloading cocaine.
[01:00:59.444 --> 01:01:01.004]  He's like, what the hell is this, man?
[01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:03.564]  They're like, come on, you've been involved in Vietnam and everything.
[01:01:03.604 --> 01:01:04.365]  You know what goes on.
[01:01:04.405 --> 01:01:06.745]  He's like, yeah, but I'm not going to be part of this.
[01:01:09.315 --> 01:01:11.096]  I mean, that's how these people operate.
[01:01:11.597 --> 01:01:17.822]  And then the SWAT team in your house and all these cops get killed fighting the drug war, but what are they going to do?
[01:01:17.842 --> 01:01:23.046]  We've got millions of cops now, millions of bureaucrats, millions of people in prison.
[01:01:23.066 --> 01:01:24.186]  They've got to do something!
[01:01:24.207 --> 01:01:26.708]  We've got to make a deal with the cops.
[01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:28.910]  We'll let you have two million cops like there are.
[01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:31.332]  We'll just pay you paychecks and go drink lemonade.
[01:01:32.833 --> 01:01:34.434]  I mean, they just don't hurt us anymore.
[01:01:34.454 --> 01:01:37.857]  I mean, they already, the more cops we get, they won't come to your house when you're robbed.
[01:01:38.197 --> 01:01:38.818]  Have you noticed that?
[01:01:41.007 --> 01:01:46.150]  Back when I was a kid and there was 250,000 cops, then it was 300,000, then it was a million, then two million.
[01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:50.773]  Man, something happened, the cops were there in five minutes and they were, oh, we're going to investigate this.
[01:01:50.813 --> 01:01:52.134]  They were actual officers.
[01:01:52.394 --> 01:01:53.094]  Were they corrupt?
[01:01:53.935 --> 01:01:54.235]  Yes.
[01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:54.995]  Were they perfect?
[01:01:55.076 --> 01:01:55.336]  No.
[01:01:55.636 --> 01:01:56.777]  But most of them were good.
[01:01:57.257 --> 01:01:58.438]  It is not that way now.
[01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:03.281]  I can't get a cop out to my house if it gets burglarized.
[01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:05.322]  I can't get a cop when my car gets stolen.
[01:02:06.735 --> 01:02:08.076]  But you know what, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:02:08.096 --> 01:02:12.898]  You pull over on the side of the road and try to urinate, they'll take you to jail for exposing yourself.
[01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:19.181]  You, uh... Everybody I know isn't speeding now.
[01:02:19.221 --> 01:02:21.342]  They just get pulled over and they want to search your car.
[01:02:21.422 --> 01:02:25.804]  All these emails are pouring in where you'll just be in a shopping mall parking lot and they'll just stop everybody and search them.
[01:02:26.084 --> 01:02:26.864]  Or on the road.
[01:02:27.485 --> 01:02:28.425]  They're just searching us.
[01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:29.585]  It's in the news.
[01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:31.786]  They're running these martial law drills.
[01:02:32.907 --> 01:02:34.848]  I said I was going to news blitz and I'm already ranting.
[01:02:37.378 --> 01:02:40.240]  Okay, here is the stacks of news that I have.
[01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:51.689]  And there is a lot of it, and so I am just going to go through it as fast as I can.
[01:02:54.651 --> 01:02:55.351]  Oh my gosh.
[01:02:55.752 --> 01:02:56.472]  Where to start?
[01:02:56.552 --> 01:02:57.213]  Where to begin?
[01:02:57.233 --> 01:02:58.394]  Oh man.
[01:03:00.195 --> 01:03:06.219]  This is the stack of what I have not covered yet.
[01:03:07.469 --> 01:03:08.371]  Good God.
[01:03:09.294 --> 01:03:10.537]  Probably 60 articles.
[01:03:10.557 --> 01:03:11.178]  Okay.
[01:03:12.697 --> 01:03:15.860]  Let's just go ahead and give you the brief version of what's going on.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:24.867]  Christina Todd Whitman, not liable for telling residents the World Trade Center error was safe to breathe, judge rules, Associated Press, and I will just give you the backstory, you can Google this.
[01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:37.757]  They knew day one it was deadly and the White House ordered her to lie day two when she sent a memo saying it's deadly, asbestos, concrete, toxins, the meters are off the charts, it's a chemical disaster,
[01:03:38.357 --> 01:03:43.319]  And they were ordered to lie and say it was good, and she is not liable.
[01:03:43.599 --> 01:03:46.760]  That is Associated Press.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.120]  Okay.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.760]  That is one article.
[01:03:50.361 --> 01:03:53.121]  Behind TV Analysts, Pentagon's Hidden Hand.
[01:03:53.142 --> 01:04:04.725]  This is a New York Times whitewash, but admitting that every one of the military analysts is on the Pentagon payroll or control, lying to the public.
[01:04:05.965 --> 01:04:07.186]  There that is for you in the video cam.
[01:04:08.507 --> 01:04:18.070]  Recapping, I had Dr. Ibrahim Dramali on the show today talk about how it looked like he'd been tortured and murdered by the local Palestinian activists and thrown in the river.
[01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:22.832]  Unbelievable, that's about to retransmit when the show restarts feeding on the internet.
[01:04:23.592 --> 01:04:25.452]  Unbelievable first hour coming up.
[01:04:26.013 --> 01:04:28.373]  Unbelievable second hour coming up in about 25 minutes.
[01:04:30.754 --> 01:04:31.874]  Oh, let's get technical, 22 and a half.
[01:04:35.168 --> 01:04:40.553]  Colorado lawmaker removed from podium over Mexican's remark, even though I disagree with his remark.
[01:04:40.593 --> 01:04:41.734]  He shouldn't be removed.
[01:04:41.754 --> 01:04:42.895]  That's a violation of free speech.
[01:04:43.275 --> 01:04:46.818]  Colorado legislature, known for kicking a photographer, was ordered to leave the podium.
[01:04:47.099 --> 01:04:50.502]  The state House of Representatives on Monday because he called Mexican workers illiterate peasants.
[01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:55.729]  Now, I don't know if that's an unmean way to say it, but they do get free health care, free everything.
[01:04:55.749 --> 01:04:57.090]  They are above the law, like the police.
[01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.512]  They don't get arrested for DWI.
[01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:00.753]  And they are illiterate peasants.
[01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:02.135]  That's what the Mexican government calls them.
[01:05:03.015 --> 01:05:04.316]  But I don't agree with the way he did it.
[01:05:04.336 --> 01:05:04.717]  He should have.
[01:05:05.077 --> 01:05:08.360]  But if you actually read the quote, it took a little bit out of context.
[01:05:12.967 --> 01:05:19.149]  He said, I would like to have the opportunity to state at the microphone why I don't think we need 5,000 more illiterate peasants in Colorado, Bruce said.
[01:05:19.909 --> 01:05:20.890]  They call it an outburst.
[01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:24.411]  Well, the point is, it could have been more tactfully done, but everything is bankrupting.
[01:05:24.871 --> 01:05:39.356]  I mean, there was an article in Washington Post about how illegals get tens of thousands of free liver, heart, kidney transplants and go to the head of the line, because you can't discriminate, so they have to go to the head of the line.
[01:05:41.428 --> 01:05:44.270]  Told you when my finger was cut off I couldn't get service, but the illegals could.
[01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:46.151]  That's the Bush's war.
[01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:50.073]  Sue V.A., more than half wounded troops slipping through the cracks.
[01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:52.615]  Alternet not getting treatment.
[01:05:54.836 --> 01:05:56.558]  Summit renamed to defend North American
[01:05:57.601 --> 01:05:58.302]  Union critics.
[01:05:59.082 --> 01:06:06.406]  Bush and Mexican-Canadian leaders in New Orleans for fourth annual meeting as the fourth annual summit of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America begins in New Orleans.
[01:06:06.826 --> 01:06:14.331]  White House is engaging in public relations campaign to reposition the meeting away from the controversial issue of continued continental integration.
[01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:17.292]  Build instead the North American Leaders Summit.
[01:06:17.352 --> 01:06:18.112]  They've changed it.
[01:06:18.832 --> 01:06:30.975]  The meeting appears designed to create photo opportunities showing President Bush with Mexico's President Felipe Calderon and Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper rather than emphasize the Trilateral Cooperation, the centerpiece of the previous SPP Summits.
[01:06:30.995 --> 01:06:38.997]  They've got their own documents where they admit that they are merging all of this and say they've got to keep it secret from us and then it's a North American Union.
[01:06:40.049 --> 01:06:49.736]  That's the September 22nd to 24th BAMF Canada lawsuit documents available at JudicialWatch.org.
[01:06:51.417 --> 01:06:56.241]  There is that, kind of like Dinecore changed his name after he got caught running giant child kidnapping rings.
[01:06:57.162 --> 01:06:58.823]  By the way, you can't make stuff up like that.
[01:06:59.003 --> 01:07:00.324]  Go look into it, find out it's true.
[01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:03.726]  I know you're a cop laughing in your car, but that's who you work for, okay?
[01:07:03.907 --> 01:07:07.129]  Go look it up and then cry your guts out and realize you work for Satan himself, okay?
[01:07:07.489 --> 01:07:08.010]  It's all over.
[01:07:08.772 --> 01:07:09.952]  I'm surprised I'm even alive.
[01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:11.233]  I thank God every day.
[01:07:12.073 --> 01:07:13.093]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:07:14.173 --> 01:07:17.434]  Food rationing confronts Bread Basket of the World.
[01:07:18.415 --> 01:07:24.096]  AP and everybody else are reporting, I got a stack of these from yesterday and never even got to, that food rationing has already begun.
[01:07:24.156 --> 01:07:26.737]  Lots of food, you'll notice, isn't on store shelves now.
[01:07:27.137 --> 01:07:30.778]  Staples, corn, wheat, bread, things that it's involved with.
[01:07:30.798 --> 01:07:32.998]  The prices are up 40 percent, exploding.
[01:07:33.459 --> 01:07:34.699]  Everything we told you would happen.
[01:07:35.539 --> 01:07:38.781]  Because the dollar is plunging in value and there's problems worldwide.
[01:07:39.181 --> 01:07:42.724]  Big Agra is engineering this collapse.
[01:07:43.004 --> 01:07:52.650]  Kurt Nimmo wrote a detailed article about that last night with all their official UN documents on Infowars.com if you want to actually know what they're doing.
[01:07:57.037 --> 01:07:59.279]  Olympic torch anti-freedom farce continues.
[01:07:59.359 --> 01:08:01.720]  Media ban from torch rally through nation's capital.
[01:08:02.621 --> 01:08:10.946]  In Australia, they are banning the media from covering the Olympic torch, where Chinese paramilitary forces have attacked U.S.
[01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.727]  citizens, British, French, and others.
[01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:14.849]  Unbelievable.
[01:08:15.129 --> 01:08:16.770]  Can't let the slaves know what's going on.
[01:08:18.385 --> 01:08:18.586]  U.S.
[01:08:18.626 --> 01:08:23.637]  military denies German citizen, detains German citizen in Afghanistan.
[01:08:23.657 --> 01:08:25.502]  A little report on that.
[01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:27.225]  Can't be there covering what's happening.
[01:08:29.491 --> 01:08:30.832]  And the suspicion of terrorism.
[01:08:30.852 --> 01:08:32.953]  The report is, though, that it's an aid group.
[01:08:34.354 --> 01:08:38.016]  Feds change policy, will now collect DNA from every person they arrest.
[01:08:38.256 --> 01:08:40.697]  And that means local police under federalization.
[01:08:41.038 --> 01:08:47.221]  And now you know why at checkpoints all over the country they're taking blood and tissue out of your cheeks in the last year they've been doing it.
[01:08:47.281 --> 01:08:49.803]  Really, it goes back a decade, but now it's nationwide.
[01:08:50.123 --> 01:08:55.046]  They're now admitting, and by the way, I heard Gary Brownfield reading mainstream news today on the air, on the network,
[01:08:55.886 --> 01:08:57.327]  And I pulled it up, there it was.
[01:08:57.427 --> 01:09:01.529]  Mainstream News is now announcing that every baby at birth is put in a DNA database for the government.
[01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:04.351]  They don't tell you, though, that's been going on for 35 years criminally.
[01:09:04.551 --> 01:09:05.972]  The government is criminal.
[01:09:06.252 --> 01:09:06.812]  You understand?
[01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:10.374]  Feds change policy will now collect DNA from everybody.
[01:09:10.655 --> 01:09:14.457]  So they're basically now just whitewashing what they're doing.
[01:09:15.998 --> 01:09:18.799]  See, they announce what they're doing decades after it's in place.
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:23.162]  New Jersey court requires subpoena for internet subscriber records.
[01:09:24.546 --> 01:09:28.309]  That's something attacking free speech on the web.
[01:09:31.451 --> 01:09:38.256]  There's a report up on PrisonPlanet.com about We Are Change being provocateured and set up in New York, not just in Ireland.
[01:09:38.276 --> 01:09:41.859]  And that's also at WeAreChange.org right there.
[01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:50.037]  Grumbel says financial system narrowly averted collapse.
[01:09:51.018 --> 01:09:55.245]  This is Oswald Grumbel, well-known ex-CEO of Credit Suisse.
[01:09:55.766 --> 01:09:58.330]  Bank confirms an interview given to Swiss newspaper.
[01:09:59.881 --> 01:10:10.908]  Sootensjblak that the world financial system was sharply near to collapse in mid-March when Bear Stearns collapsed without intervention of the central banks, the system would have not survived.
[01:10:11.349 --> 01:10:26.499]  He compared the moment with the Cuba crisis, with the Cuban Missile Crisis, as I see it, the first time that an insider spoke so clearly about the dramatic situation of our days, one bank collapsing, he added, and the whole system will crash.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.161]  Wow.
[01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:31.467]  So there is that.
[01:10:31.567 --> 01:10:33.788]  Border fence leaves rich and powerful untouched.
[01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:46.612]  The Texas Observer, and it says that they are not really even building it, they're just using it piece by piece to grab people's property, then leaving large areas owned by rich people or special interest alone.
[01:10:46.672 --> 01:10:50.513]  Yeah, they've built like 40 miles of fence, they're supposed to have the whole thing built
[01:10:50.993 --> 01:11:01.640]  Two years ago, and they only build it in selective areas, and they put openings in it for, quote, wildlife to go through, and then drainage ditches that a man can bend down only halfway and go right underneath.
[01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:08.082]  That story is up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:11:08.382 --> 01:11:12.465]  In Florida, snooping cops disguise cameras as fire hydrants.
[01:11:12.505 --> 01:11:19.290]  Kurt Nemo gets into that and they just randomly surveil everyone saying that everyone could be terrorists.
[01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:21.892]  So that report is up there.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:29.968]  Not getting into much detail here because this is the news that I do read in detail and then never have a chance to properly cover on air.
[01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:35.115]  Pipe down, Brussels slaps a noise order on the heart of Scotland.
[01:11:37.762 --> 01:11:38.182]  That's right.
[01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:42.964]  They're telling bus drivers they've got to stop every 25 miles, get everybody off to walk for their health.
[01:11:44.184 --> 01:11:47.345]  They're saying you can't use pounds at your grocery stores, you'll be arrested.
[01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:47.965]  People are.
[01:11:48.225 --> 01:11:50.446]  They're saying what speech you can and can't have.
[01:11:50.986 --> 01:11:54.047]  It's all about the EU showing England how they're under their control.
[01:11:54.807 --> 01:11:56.729]  England always swore they'd allow a vote on it.
[01:11:57.069 --> 01:11:57.629]  Doesn't matter.
[01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:01.733]  They signed the EU Court Agreement.
[01:12:01.773 --> 01:12:03.174]  Now they're under EU tyranny.
[01:12:03.655 --> 01:12:07.418]  Pipe down, Brussels slaps a noise order on the heart of Scotland.
[01:12:07.438 --> 01:12:13.523]  Their high-pitched shrill has put fear into the hearts of Scotland's enemies and sensitive tourists reaching for the cotton wool.
[01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.364]  Well, I love the sound of bagpipes.
[01:12:15.845 --> 01:12:21.509]  Now, however, the bagpipes are to be quieted by an edict from Brussels.
[01:12:22.403 --> 01:12:28.146]  From this month on, pipers will adhere to strict volume limits or risk breaking European Union health and safety rules.
[01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:37.271]  Now remember, the European Union allows the mosquito system, ultra-low frequency, that actually damages your ears, to be put out in city streets to quote, keep kids from congregating.
[01:12:37.851 --> 01:12:40.312]  They can damage your ears, but oh, you can't have bagpipes.
[01:12:40.352 --> 01:12:45.195]  They pick things that sound ridiculous to set these precedents.
[01:12:45.235 --> 01:12:50.858]  They can make you do something dumb, like take your shoes off, or be strict at the airport, or not carry shampoo on.
[01:12:51.818 --> 01:12:53.939]  Or have checkpoints on the highway without warrants.
[01:12:53.959 --> 01:12:55.220]  You'll accept anything.
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:59.062]  So now they're saying that they are banning bagpipes.
[01:12:59.082 --> 01:13:02.464]  They're also saying they're not allowed to use the particular wood out of Africa.
[01:13:02.484 --> 01:13:03.705]  They're trying to ban it there.
[01:13:03.745 --> 01:13:13.450]  They attack cultural icons to set precedence, because if you'll accept that, you'll accept anything classic Pavlovian conditioning, hardcore behavioral psychology, black-op attack.
[01:13:14.051 --> 01:13:15.511]  There is that article, Times of London.
[01:13:17.252 --> 01:13:18.073]  Not playing games.
[01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:22.629]  AT&T serves notice.
[01:13:22.769 --> 01:13:25.749]  Internet has three years before it faces board assimilation.
[01:13:25.809 --> 01:13:36.752]  Curt Nemo, Infowars.com, he has their own statements about how they're going to shut down the old web, make you go on the new web, where you have to pay much more, and where there's no freedom of speech, because you'll have subdomains on their sites.
[01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:43.494]  So all of those busy on the message boards at Infowars, where we let you do it unless you slander or threaten people to kill them,
[01:13:45.489 --> 01:13:49.792]  We also have people that would go on there and threaten themselves and then say, how dare you not kick them off?
[01:13:49.852 --> 01:13:51.593]  We traced the IP, it was the same guys.
[01:13:51.813 --> 01:13:54.015]  So we do kick some people off, but it's pretty wild.
[01:13:54.035 --> 01:13:56.156]  You can do pretty much what you want there, as long as it's serious.
[01:13:56.637 --> 01:13:58.758]  And not kill this person, kill that person.
[01:13:58.978 --> 01:14:03.081]  We've already had the Secret Service drop by, so nice try guys, we tracked it back to you.
[01:14:04.042 --> 01:14:05.623]  So that's why that's going on there.
[01:14:05.643 --> 01:14:09.466]  Oh, you didn't know about that?
[01:14:09.486 --> 01:14:10.066]  Yeah, that happened.
[01:14:13.095 --> 01:14:16.798]  AT&T, again, that's how they're shutting it down.
[01:14:16.818 --> 01:14:17.719]  It's called Internet 2.
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.922]  Funding worries Fusion Center officials.
[01:14:21.482 --> 01:14:26.387]  Another unfunded mandate by the federal government.
[01:14:27.611 --> 01:14:33.736]  In the late 90s, they built emergency management centers in rural areas, in four and five county areas, in big cities.
[01:14:34.176 --> 01:14:37.398]  They made the citizens pay for it with unfunded mandates locally.
[01:14:37.919 --> 01:14:42.702]  They integrate the police under federal control to run checkpoints, martial law sweeps in their own words.
[01:14:43.383 --> 01:14:45.284]  But now the feds aren't even going to pay for any of it.
[01:14:45.324 --> 01:14:47.006]  We've got to all pay for it ourselves.
[01:14:47.586 --> 01:14:52.127]  So, just another tax of Big Brother there for you.
[01:14:53.027 --> 01:14:58.308]  That's out of FCW.com, a big site that attracts government, a federal computer weekly.
[01:14:59.308 --> 01:14:59.509]  U.S.
[01:14:59.549 --> 01:15:01.909]  military targets southwest Colorado.
[01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:06.410]  They're busy land grabbing, shoving around whoever they want, doing whatever they want.
[01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:08.110]  That's out of Renew America.
[01:15:09.331 --> 01:15:13.071]  Food rationing begins in America, KPTM Television.
[01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:15.812]  Food shortages and rationing have
[01:15:17.307 --> 01:15:24.292]  Been a third world problem as of late, but recently the phenomenon, once thought unthinkable in the United States, could start happening.
[01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:31.776]  The New York Sun paper is reporting that major retailers of both coasts are limiting consumers' purchase of flour, rice and cooking oil.
[01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:35.239]  The Sun reports that Costco warehouse in California ran out of rice.
[01:15:35.959 --> 01:15:36.900]  Frustrating shoppers.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.700]  Where's the rice?
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.303]  An engineer from Palo Alto, California said you should be able to buy something like rice.
[01:15:41.323 --> 01:15:41.963]  This is ridiculous.
[01:15:42.364 --> 01:15:43.584]  Not in the new global system.
[01:15:43.604 --> 01:15:46.827]  You read State Department Memorandum 200 and all their other official documents.
[01:15:46.867 --> 01:15:48.928]  This is all stated by them.
[01:15:48.948 --> 01:15:50.970]  And Richard Inhas, head of the CFR,
[01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:52.110]  We're good to go.
[01:16:08.559 --> 01:16:13.002]  system to quote wage war on humans by the elite.
[01:16:13.543 --> 01:16:18.426]  Public stated as I told you and somebody found their own documents where they said exactly what I'm saying.
[01:16:18.646 --> 01:16:19.487]  I mean it's not hard.
[01:16:19.587 --> 01:16:21.208]  It's a public attack pattern.
[01:16:21.568 --> 01:16:23.409]  This whole anti-terror thing is for you.
[01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:32.396]  The whole environmental deal is to restrict and tax and control you while they engage in total environmental Armageddon with the genetic engineering and the rest of it.
[01:16:32.656 --> 01:16:34.777]  The fish infusions, cyclotrons, all of it.
[01:16:34.817 --> 01:16:35.518]  It's just insane.
[01:16:36.561 --> 01:16:39.143]  If you don't know what cyclotrons are, you better find out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:39.183 --> 01:16:41.865]  Food shortages or globalist depopulation agenda.
[01:16:41.905 --> 01:16:44.567]  This is the key article that Nemo did yesterday.
[01:16:44.727 --> 01:16:45.808]  He spent hours doing this.
[01:16:45.828 --> 01:16:46.569]  You ought to go read it.
[01:16:47.349 --> 01:16:49.911]  Food shortages or globalist depopulation agenda.
[01:16:50.692 --> 01:16:51.192]  Continuing.
[01:16:51.512 --> 01:16:53.474]  Recycling cops freak out residents.
[01:16:53.494 --> 01:16:56.176]  This has already happened in England, where they have tracker chips that track you.
[01:16:56.376 --> 01:17:00.019]  They check to make sure you're putting your bottles and things in there, or they fine and fee you.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.400]  There you go.
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.502]  Recycling cops freak out.
[01:17:05.094 --> 01:17:07.975]  Residents, ah yes, the new Enviro spies.
[01:17:08.215 --> 01:17:12.556]  They have all these white papers written, where you think CPS is bad and the cops are bad?
[01:17:12.876 --> 01:17:15.857]  They're going to have Enviro cops, home inspections every month.
[01:17:16.397 --> 01:17:19.658]  I mean, how big your house can be, any changes in your home.
[01:17:19.938 --> 01:17:21.318]  Just hell on earth, folks.
[01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:23.578]  Just absolute total control.
[01:17:23.658 --> 01:17:25.539]  Just unthinkable.
[01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:29.460]  Metals, gold rises on weak dollar, oil goes to all-time high.
[01:17:30.643 --> 01:17:32.144]  There is that for you.
[01:17:33.365 --> 01:17:35.366]  We Are Change to release assault videos.
[01:17:35.386 --> 01:17:43.772]  There's someone running around waving signs saying that We Are Change did the bombing of the recruiting center wearing Hitler mustache.
[01:17:44.232 --> 01:17:45.833]  I mean, this is just all these people.
[01:17:45.853 --> 01:17:48.095]  A lot of you are sucked into this No Plane thing.
[01:17:48.115 --> 01:17:48.675]  You don't understand.
[01:17:48.695 --> 01:17:49.716]  It's a total black op.
[01:17:50.376 --> 01:17:51.797]  I saw it coming a mile away.
[01:17:51.817 --> 01:17:56.581]  Final segment totally jam-packed with documents and articles on the other side.
[01:17:57.121 --> 01:17:58.442]  Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:58.762 --> 01:17:59.243]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:18:03.396 --> 01:18:08.238]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[01:18:08.478 --> 01:18:12.239]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:21.883]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[01:18:22.043 --> 01:18:26.264]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.

[01:19:10.023 --> 01:19:11.624]  He gets uptight so easily.
[01:19:11.824 --> 01:19:12.184]  I know.
[01:19:12.504 --> 01:19:15.645]  My Gary has high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:19:15.745 --> 01:19:17.646]  I always think about the what if.
[01:19:17.946 --> 01:19:18.526]  I know.
[01:19:18.766 --> 01:19:22.107]  Ladies, you need to get your husband's Coco Pure Chocolate Tea.
[01:19:22.267 --> 01:19:23.168]  Chocolate tea?
[01:19:23.288 --> 01:19:24.328]  That sounds delicious.
[01:19:24.408 --> 01:19:26.168]  The information is all over the news.
[01:19:26.368 --> 01:19:34.511]  Coco without the high fat and an extract from red wine are both shown to have heart benefits, including supporting healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
[01:19:34.938 --> 01:19:36.999]  See, I told you chocolate was good for us.

[01:20:16.213 --> 01:20:22.980]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.883]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[01:20:47.136 --> 01:20:47.636]  I'm good.
[01:21:27.651 --> 01:21:30.753]  We got some big guests coming up this week on the show and next week.
[01:21:30.793 --> 01:21:32.754]  I'm just going to give you a fair warning.
[01:21:32.774 --> 01:21:34.474]  Burmas will be filling in Thursday.
[01:21:34.494 --> 01:21:36.175]  I got four guests.
[01:21:36.255 --> 01:21:38.557]  Two of them are huge on Friday.
[01:21:39.097 --> 01:21:40.157]  Big guests next week.
[01:21:40.177 --> 01:21:44.820]  A lot of other surprises for you, the viewers and the listeners.
[01:21:46.095 --> 01:21:48.335]  Sheriffs back three jails for illegal immigrants.
[01:21:48.815 --> 01:21:58.057]  News 19 sounds reasonable in Myrtle Beach, but when you read it's federally funded, locally run prisons for illegal aliens and terrorists.
[01:21:58.877 --> 01:22:00.938]  And they have a few of these for shows.
[01:22:00.978 --> 01:22:02.138]  They have one outside Austin.
[01:22:02.798 --> 01:22:04.918]  They mainly just harass Arabs and a few other people.
[01:22:04.938 --> 01:22:07.719]  The illegals have been caught literally cleaning the prison.
[01:22:07.739 --> 01:22:12.560]  It's like the illegals were caught building the border prison under the border fence.
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:13.920]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.908]  uh... so there is that article that's the problem is that this is uh... again all staged
[01:22:22.031 --> 01:22:24.192]  Very sophisticated, the people that run things.
[01:22:25.032 --> 01:22:25.673]  50% of L.A.
[01:22:25.693 --> 01:22:30.615]  workforce are immigrants, UPI, and the problem is, I've talked to people that are chefs there, black, white.
[01:22:31.155 --> 01:22:33.036]  If you're not a Mexican, you don't get hired now.
[01:22:33.076 --> 01:22:37.098]  They'll run you out of the dry-cleaning business.
[01:22:37.778 --> 01:22:38.538]  And this is what's happening.
[01:22:38.558 --> 01:22:39.179]  This is racism.
[01:22:39.199 --> 01:22:43.060]  I'm not saying all Hispanics do this, but the La Rican geese do, especially in L.A.
[01:22:43.781 --> 01:22:50.204]  You're not allowed, you can't work in the restaurant, you can't work in custodial services, and it's
[01:22:53.297 --> 01:22:53.878]  50% of L.A.
[01:22:53.898 --> 01:22:54.859]  workforce are immigrants.
[01:22:55.939 --> 01:22:59.783]  And of course, 75% of the children there, more than half the children in Texas are.
[01:23:00.704 --> 01:23:02.825]  And the problem is they're not being taught to love this country.
[01:23:02.845 --> 01:23:05.828]  They're being taught by the Ford Foundation that this is Mexico.
[01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:09.771]  Also, oil, as I mentioned, goes record above 118 a barrel.
[01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:10.912]  There's the actual number.
[01:23:11.813 --> 01:23:13.853]  On that, I mean this is just unbelievable.
[01:23:14.474 --> 01:23:15.514]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:23:15.914 --> 01:23:19.035]  Disney launching unit to make environmental films for children.
[01:23:19.515 --> 01:23:21.735]  AP, this will be shown in schools everywhere.
[01:23:22.195 --> 01:23:28.417]  All about worshipping Gaia, giving your rights up, hating humanity, making humans the enemy, in the words of the chairman of the CFR.
[01:23:28.817 --> 01:23:32.738]  But of course, an enemy the government and the Pentagon are willing to deal with.
[01:23:33.958 --> 01:23:35.858]  Oh yes, their eugenics program.
[01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:38.699]  So there's the Disney launching unit to make environmental films.
[01:23:40.273 --> 01:23:43.358]  More convicted felons allowed to enlist in Army and the Marines.
[01:23:44.059 --> 01:23:45.541]  That's ABC News.
[01:23:45.581 --> 01:23:49.987]  I have another AP article on this as well.
[01:23:51.363 --> 01:23:53.344]  And they only give you a small percentage of it.
[01:23:53.404 --> 01:24:05.473]  I remember eight years ago, seeing in Washington papers, Washington Times, Washington Post with a report, and they said it was very good of course, you can pull them up, that aggravated felons who were illegal aliens were being hired out of the prisons.
[01:24:06.093 --> 01:24:11.237]  And I still get emails saying, I'm making this up, here is AP for you if you'd rather have that.
[01:24:12.357 --> 01:24:16.399]  Also, surgeons give hope to blind with successful bionic eye operation.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.921]  They're able to give people sight now.
[01:24:18.981 --> 01:24:28.786]  It's not as good as regular sight, but it will be soon, and it's just amazing and wonderful, and this is why the elite want to kill 80% of us or more, because they don't want the general public having access to all of this.
[01:24:29.086 --> 01:24:29.787]  It's a revolution.
[01:24:29.807 --> 01:24:35.670]  They're trying to suppress, and they use homeland security and the global tyranny to suppress all the real technologies that have been developed.
[01:24:37.354 --> 01:24:39.236]  Bank of America net income falls 75%.
[01:24:40.278 --> 01:24:41.319]  They're in deep trouble.
[01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:44.562]  That's Bloomberg Financial for you.
[01:24:47.205 --> 01:24:48.566]  Tony Snow to go to CNN.
[01:24:48.586 --> 01:24:49.167]  Who cares?
[01:24:49.247 --> 01:24:50.949]  Sending Marines to recruit women.
[01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:54.633]  Japan's hunger becomes a dire warning for other nations.
[01:24:54.693 --> 01:24:56.855]  Major food shortages in Japan.
[01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:00.247]  I am out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:01.528 --> 01:25:04.409]  I hope that you will all join me live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:25:04.429 --> 01:25:05.070]  to 3 p.m.
[01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:06.971]  here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.

[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.122]  I just want to commend everybody and thank you.
[01:25:26.502 --> 01:25:29.424]  My first and second hour today were unbelievably important.
[01:25:30.545 --> 01:25:33.347]  Clear evidence of the local person being murdered.
