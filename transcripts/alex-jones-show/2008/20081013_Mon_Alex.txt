[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:20.353]  We'll be taking your calls coming up in the next segment of the Balance the Radio Show with Bob Dacey with us in studio for the next hour and a half.
[00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:25.874]  We're live at PrisonPlanet.tv for the Balance of the Radio Show the next hour and 27 minutes.
[00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:28.735]  Again, we'll be talking about the economy.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.972]  The banker takeover that's taking place, the immunity they're getting, the open discussions of martial law where the public sees the troops going on the streets of America, hears they're going to be used for riot control and crowd control.
[00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:42.613]  That is martial law.
[00:00:42.674 --> 00:00:44.175]  The Army's telling everybody that.
[00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.117]  They're saying we're working with the police.
[00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:48.279]  You know, the decades of having the police
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:00.684]  And military and urban warfare drills, and now the last eight years of the military checking bags at high school, college, and NFL football games, and the Kentucky Derby, and any other high-profile event, getting you prepared.
[00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:01.905]  They're admitting it was preparing you.
[00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.787]  And Homeland Security head Ridge, and now Chernoff, saying they want to use the U.S.
[00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:12.489]  military against the American people, and the gun confiscation in New Orleans and surrounding areas, and now gun confiscation in Illinois.
[00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:18.794]  With the Governor a month ago coming out and saying, yeah, we're going to use the Army to do door-to-door gun confiscation.
[00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:22.536]  The knock-and-talk, where the police come to your house and knock and say, do you have any guns?
[00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:23.536]  We want to inspect them.
[00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:25.697]  If it's an area where guns are illegal, do you have guns?
[00:01:25.717 --> 00:01:26.578]  We're going to come in and look.
[00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:27.819]  Intimidating their way in.
[00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:29.419]  That is martial law.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.342]  Congress being threatened, you better pass this Banker Takeover Bill or we'll declare martial law.
[00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:35.883]  That's actually happening.
[00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:38.864]  And the mainstream media makes jokes and says, where are the troops?
[00:01:39.144 --> 00:01:40.184]  Where are the parachutes?
[00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:41.224]  Where are they taking over?
[00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:46.546]  Ignoring the fact that we told them this was all being set up, and now it's being phased in incrementally.
[00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:51.607]  I want to talk about that first, Bob, then we'll get into toll roads and everything else that's happening in the North American Union.
[00:01:51.647 --> 00:01:57.689]  We have a clip from Lou Dobbs, of all places, admitting they're still going ahead with the North American Union.
[00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.390]  That's coming up in a few minutes, but Bob Dacey, your take on everything that's happening.
[00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.853]  Well, Alex, it's kind of hard to keep up with it.
[00:02:03.893 --> 00:02:09.740]  I'm amazed at your ability to just run these things off one after another after another after another.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.502]  I can't keep up with it.
[00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:20.112]  You know, two weeks ago I was in the studio when the Congress grew some false cojones and voted down the bailout.
[00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:22.093]  And you were in a pretty good mood that day.
[00:02:22.113 --> 00:02:25.856]  I just hope you don't burn down your desk today like you almost did last time.
[00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:28.598]  I hope you're a little bit more serious today.
[00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.900]  I was burning a dollar on there.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.263]  Yeah, burning a dollar on there with a stack of papers underneath.
[00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:35.884]  He's a brave guy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:36.344 --> 00:02:41.407]  No, I just think that it's nuts, just insane, and that's all there is to it.
[00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.908]  And it's not by accident.
[00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:58.917]  You know, one of the things about this financial thing, you know, I was taught that these guys, you know, Morgan Stanley and old Dean Witter, and who was the old crotchety guy that said, we earn money the old-fashioned way.
[00:02:59.017 --> 00:03:00.137]  We earn it.
[00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:01.838]  You know, whichever one that was.
[00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:04.360]  You know, these guys are supposed to be pretty smart.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.262]  And for all these financial firms to... We earn money the old-fashioned way.
[00:03:09.302 --> 00:03:10.623]  We steal it.
[00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:18.427]  Yeah, well, you know, for all these guys that are supposed to be so smart, the first thing they tell you as an investor is, diversify, diversify.
[00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:21.089]  For all these guys... Long haul!
[00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.090]  Long run.
[00:03:36.778 --> 00:03:42.062]  I mean, you would have to believe that all these people are stupid in order to do that.
[00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:47.966]  But no, they have been openly moving the money into other accounts, into personal assets.
[00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:49.547]  Now they're just imploding the front company.
[00:03:49.787 --> 00:04:00.215]  What I'm saying is that you would have to be an idiot to take all your stuff and put it in one risky basket such that if it goes south, your entire operation goes down.
[00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:03.337]  Therefore, I would conclude that they did it on purpose.
[00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:09.225]  Well then we have all the documents where they did do it on purpose and now they're admitting we may use the army if there's riots.
[00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:15.674]  We just so happen to have secretly trained them over two decades for this now and have all these secret relationships we've set up.
[00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:19.226]  Well, like I say, they're not dumb.
[00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:23.148]  And I am baffled.
[00:04:23.168 --> 00:04:26.250]  You know, the stock market's jumped up about 600 points today.
[00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.671]  I guess they're trying to get more idiots to think, Oh, everything's fine now!
[00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:30.812]  Everything's fine now!
[00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:36.354]  They printed a bunch of money out of thin air and they're going to bail out the bankers and everything.
[00:04:36.414 --> 00:04:39.456]  And we can do bait and switch on you and everything is fine.
[00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:43.998]  Remember, Alex, two weeks ago, the big deal was Bernanke said that the idea was
[00:04:44.498 --> 00:04:50.163]  We get our $700 billion, and what we do is we buy the mortgages, and that's the cause of the problem.
[00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:54.867]  We buy the mortgages at close-to-face value, and therefore everything will be great, right?
[00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:57.029]  And then all of a sudden they do the bait-and-sweep.
[00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:57.469]  Oh, wait!
[00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:00.131]  We're going to buy principal in the company!
[00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:01.933]  Instead, they haven't bought any mortgages.
[00:05:02.053 --> 00:05:02.273]  Wait!
[00:05:02.313 --> 00:05:03.954]  Now that we've got the money and now that we've got the
[00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:07.898]  The Cahoney-less Congress to do what we wanted them to do.
[00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:09.259]  Now, oh wait, wait!
[00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.440]  Forget about the mortgages.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.582]  Now we're going to own the banks.
[00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:14.023]  Now we're going to buy interest into the banks.
[00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:15.024]  It's bait and switch.
[00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:17.206]  In retail you call that bait and switch, Alex.
[00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:21.510]  That's where they tell you one thing, you do it, and then they switch you to something else when you get there.
[00:05:21.997 --> 00:05:26.599]  You know, and they also told us, you know, if we don't do this bailout, we're all going to die.
[00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:27.740]  You know, the market's going to plunge.
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.141]  And so they did the bailout, the market plunged anyway.
[00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:31.741]  Of course it was going to plunge, you know.
[00:05:32.122 --> 00:05:40.505]  But now, what, the other day, what, today or yesterday, Mitsubishi loaned Morgan Stanley or bought into $9 billion.
[00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:43.267]  And now everything's just fine.
[00:05:43.788 --> 00:05:44.568]  Everything's just fine.
[00:05:44.948 --> 00:05:46.550]  Go home, relax everybody, don't worry about it.
[00:05:46.570 --> 00:06:01.842]  And now they're saying they're going to buy into private companies, but the little central group of bankers, they're going to decide where government taxpayers put, and then the owners of those companies, they get the benefits, we get devalued currency, and have to pay it back in tax money.
[00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:04.685]  Yeah, and they're getting this money from two places, right?
[00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:14.415]  They're getting this money, one, from us eventually through the taxation thing of inflation, where your money just keeps dissolving around you and you can't figure out why.
[00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.838]  And the other thing is they're just pruning some of it out of thin air.
[00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:18.880]  You call it insane.
[00:06:34.638 --> 00:06:36.360]  It's diabolically insane.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:45.147]  It's diabolical, because for people that are on the outside, who have a good world view, who want to help people, who want to live in a secure economy, a true free market, it looks insane.
[00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:49.050]  But to these robber barons, they need to destroy economies to be able to consolidate them.
[00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.753]  Yeah, yeah, it's a controlled implosion.
[00:06:53.534 --> 00:06:57.997]  My analogy to this thing is, okay, our financial house is on fire, right?
[00:06:58.397 --> 00:06:59.318]  Okay, so what do we do?
[00:06:59.518 --> 00:07:00.579]  We call the fire department.
[00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.782]  Problem is, we don't know that the fire department employs arsonists.
[00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:20.289]  Okay, so now you get a bunch of arsonists dressed up like firemen, they get in their little suits, and they get in their little fire truck, and they drive to the fire to put out the fire, and so they hook up their hoses, and we're saying, yay, they're going to save our financial house, which is on fire, and instead what they're doing is they're spraying it with gasoline.
[00:07:21.206 --> 00:07:21.907]  That's what's going on.
[00:07:21.927 --> 00:07:27.851]  And then the fire spreads, and they say, we need more firemen, give us more taxes, because the fire is spreading.
[00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:41.842]  Meanwhile, it's only securing the central banks and ensuring it implodes the real economy, so coming out on the end of it, only the central banks are in a good position, they have all the liquidity, they've cut off the liquidity of the public, and they're able to come in and buy everything up.
[00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:47.606]  They're creating a depression in the real economy, while giving unlimited liquidity, in our name, to themselves.
[00:07:47.626 --> 00:07:48.286]  Do you see what they're doing?
[00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:51.348]  I mean, what other explanation is there for it?
[00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.788]  I mean, they are not trying to stop this.
[00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.589]  They are making it worse.
[00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:00.090]  Every way you look, oh, we need another 150, Pelosi.
[00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.630]  We need another 100.
[00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.071]  Oh, we need another 150 billion, y'all.
[00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:04.211]  Okay, come on, let's go.
[00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:06.612]  Oh, and we're going to bail out these guys and those guys.
[00:08:06.692 --> 00:08:12.474]  Now they're saying they're going to bail out individual investors, but only select
[00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:19.881]  Me too, me too, you know, and then of course, you know, the Democrats go, well we need to bail out these idiots that borrowed all this money that they couldn't pay back too.
[00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:27.068]  Okay, so we're going to bail out the guys that own the properties that couldn't afford to buy them in the first place, and that'll make it okay.
[00:08:27.268 --> 00:08:29.230]  Just keep dumping money on top of everything.
[00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.293]  And what that's going to do is fully devalue the currency even faster.
[00:08:32.573 --> 00:08:35.416]  Absolutely, but you know, it's, you know, pick your poison.
[00:08:35.636 --> 00:08:36.757]  I mean, they are doing this
[00:08:37.378 --> 00:08:38.678]  They don't know what else to do.
[00:08:38.758 --> 00:08:49.421]  And out of the crisis it creates, you're going to have more crime, a bigger police state, the riots will start, and the public will beg for physical, hot martial law, not the incremental martial law.
[00:08:49.441 --> 00:08:55.683]  I just want to know, this warm, fuzzy thing of this military outfit that just came back from Iraq, going to help?
[00:08:56.143 --> 00:08:57.023]  I mean, what have they been doing?
[00:08:57.043 --> 00:09:00.904]  Well, in a read at the end of the Army Times, it lists a bunch of other brigades that are already active in the U.S.
[00:09:01.024 --> 00:09:03.767]  So the question is, what are these guys going to do?
[00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:08.793]  Well, they tell us they're going to do riot control for civil unrest and use microwave guns on us.
[00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:10.875]  Why on earth would we have any of that?
[00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:18.244]  But then, Wired Magazine comes out and they announce, the Army admits that, guess what, the microwave gun is lethal, Bob.
[00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:20.727]  You mean like the tasers are lethal?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:22.220]  Yeah.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.542]  Well, you know, you've got to break a few eggs.
[00:09:24.582 --> 00:09:30.186]  What will happen is just like with tasers, when they kill you with them, they say, well, he didn't die from the 15 taser shocks we gave him.
[00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:36.811]  Well, when they microwave gun people and they die, they'll just say, well, we happened to be microwave gunning them, but they just fell over dead.
[00:09:37.332 --> 00:09:38.893]  It's a new syndrome.
[00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:39.934]  Well, you heard that.
[00:09:40.014 --> 00:09:43.497]  All these young people dying in and around tasers, it's a syndrome, Bob.
[00:09:43.977 --> 00:09:46.179]  He stayed out in the sun too long and got a tan.
[00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:46.919]  That's what it was.
[00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:48.641]  He was killed by overtanning.
[00:09:49.361 --> 00:09:50.542]  They're going to come up with something.
[00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:51.082]  I don't know.
[00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:55.265]  Well, it's kind of like they say, we're not for a national draft, we're for national compulsory service.
[00:09:56.265 --> 00:09:58.487]  Yeah, that's what Mussolini and Hitler were all about.
[00:09:58.627 --> 00:09:59.487]  National service.
[00:09:59.868 --> 00:10:02.950]  You know, we serve the state rather than the state serves us, right?
[00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:03.790]  Absolutely.
[00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:05.811]  Crazy.
[00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:07.793]  Bob, what do you think about all the talk of martial law?
[00:10:08.729 --> 00:10:11.351]  I mean, people keep thinking it's going to come in one big spurt.
[00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:12.292]  It's already here.
[00:10:12.732 --> 00:10:18.156]  Well, you know, it's incremental, and it's not like Red Dawn.
[00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:19.998]  You know, people think it's got to be Red Dawn.
[00:10:20.418 --> 00:10:28.204]  You've got to have Cubans parachuting from out of the sky and blasting people at the neighborhood school and little guys
[00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:31.473]  You know that Wolverine blue sports jacket he wears?
[00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:47.826]  I got that.
[00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:48.587]  Oh, you did?
[00:10:48.607 --> 00:10:49.228]  Oh, how about that?
[00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:49.988]  He just gave it to me.
[00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:50.969]  God, I'm so jealous.
[00:10:50.989 --> 00:10:56.334]  I think I'm going to bring that in and show it on TV, because I was watching Red Dawn clips on YouTube last week, and I'm like, there's my jacket!
[00:10:56.634 --> 00:10:57.375]  There's my jacket!
[00:10:57.655 --> 00:10:58.336]  There's my jacket!
[00:10:58.356 --> 00:11:00.798]  When he's like up at the camp, talking to his dad at the side of the camp.
[00:11:01.099 --> 00:11:09.106]  Well, you know, martial law, you know... Well, what is accurate in the movie is everybody's spying, and they're in the hardware store, and they're saying,
[00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:19.414]  In a real world scenario, this is really minor, but in my business, I have a local hardware store here in town.
[00:11:19.454 --> 00:11:21.675]  I'm the true value guy in Austin, Texas.
[00:11:22.336 --> 00:11:28.921]  A few months ago, one of my customers that does apartment complex management sent a letter out.
[00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:30.282]  Well, that's what Ridge said.
[00:11:30.302 --> 00:11:32.863]  You're going to have to be Homeland Security approved for any job.
[00:11:32.883 --> 00:11:33.744]  And it's ridiculous.
[00:11:33.764 --> 00:11:34.525]  I mean, can you imagine that?
[00:11:34.545 --> 00:11:36.626]  But they do it through selective enforcement.
[00:11:53.357 --> 00:12:03.079]  We can't go to the hardware store to pick up them toilet parts, because their employees might be members of Al-Qaeda, and that'll endanger our people at the retirement home.
[00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:05.440]  See, that's added bureaucracy to shut your company down.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.840]  It's a crock, is what it is.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.520]  So are you going to do it?
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.061]  No.
[00:12:08.881 --> 00:12:10.701]  Absolutely not.
[00:12:10.881 --> 00:12:12.522]  I looked at that and I said, well, that's just too bad.
[00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:14.322]  I'm not going to submit to that.
[00:12:14.983 --> 00:12:19.707]  Meanwhile, I know the manager of the biggest apartment complex in Austin.
[00:12:19.727 --> 00:12:20.828]  She was told four years ago
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:42.948]  Over-enforce on citizens, but illegal aliens, let them break any rules, as many as they want in the apartments, because we've been given a secret federal grant, a tax break to do it.
[00:12:42.988 --> 00:12:50.294]  And later, a year after it came out in the paper, that big insurance companies were giving breaks and the feds were giving tax breaks.
[00:12:51.154 --> 00:13:03.885]  To companies and to different systems to quote help the illegal aliens and the AP reported they were being given preferential treatment on home loans and car loans because the government wanted to help the illegal aliens.
[00:13:04.185 --> 00:13:07.087]  Well you know Bush signed... I mean my point is it's not for our safety.
[00:13:07.147 --> 00:13:20.278]  Well you know Bush signed a bill, I wish I knew, I wish I remember where this clip was on the internet, but several years ago Bush was signing a bill bragging about how they were going to encourage all these people that couldn't afford homes to get these hundred percent mortgages with these variable
[00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:28.623]  That was a big setup so they could pump up the derivatives.
[00:13:28.803 --> 00:13:29.323]  Absolutely.
[00:13:29.343 --> 00:13:32.005]  Because then they sell the bad loan.
[00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.245]  Yeah, what does that come from?
[00:13:33.306 --> 00:13:34.686]  The whole thing comes from these people.
[00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:37.348]  Look, the government did this and now they're going to take over.
[00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:38.008]  Look at this.
[00:13:38.449 --> 00:13:40.070]  Army orders pain-ray trucks.
[00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.151]  New report shows potential for death.
[00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:43.832]  That's Wired Magazine.
[00:13:45.287 --> 00:13:50.031]  And when you read the article, it says, oh yeah, it kills you, it's going to kill you.
[00:13:50.952 --> 00:13:57.577]  They go on and say, but rubber bullets kill a good percentage of those, and so do tasers, so it's okay, we still call it non-lethal.
[00:13:57.977 --> 00:14:08.385]  But they're really called active denial systems, they're really called less lethal weapons, and they're going to deploy these to police departments, the Army's going to have them, for use against the American people.
[00:14:08.425 --> 00:14:09.146]  How does that sound, Bob?
[00:14:09.446 --> 00:14:11.228]  That sounds just wonderful.
[00:14:11.608 --> 00:14:12.168]  Absolutely.
[00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:13.950]  Because, you know, it'll be good for us.
[00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.831]  It'll be good for us.
[00:14:15.151 --> 00:14:18.353]  And then our neighbors will be snitching on us the whole time.
[00:14:18.373 --> 00:14:25.279]  We'll have Gladys Kravitz going around, peeking over her fence, going, Ah, they're not like those people over there!
[00:14:25.299 --> 00:14:27.341]  I think I saw a gun in their living room!
[00:14:27.861 --> 00:14:27.961]  Ah!
[00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:29.342]  You know, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:14:29.442 --> 00:14:31.925]  I mean, like I say, I cannot keep up with it.
[00:14:31.945 --> 00:14:33.266]  I don't see how you keep up with it.
[00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:34.331]  I really don't.
[00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:36.072]  Well, they're training kids in the U.S.
[00:14:36.112 --> 00:14:37.712]  and England to be, quote, climate cops.
[00:14:37.732 --> 00:14:50.576]  It was in the New York Times saying it was good as the five-year-olds denounce their mommies and daddies, and the school has them write dossiers on them about their environmental crimes, and now they're already switching it over to drugs, guns, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[00:14:50.976 --> 00:14:59.079]  Austin schools, I have this on video, it's in Road to Tyranny, teach the kids to go and look in the medicine cabinet and write down what's in it when they're in the sixth grade.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.901]  Land of the free, home of the brave, man.
[00:15:01.921 --> 00:15:07.247]  Meanwhile, the government is pushing the prescription drugs on the kids and shipping the narcotics in.
[00:15:07.387 --> 00:15:08.348]  That's new freedom, though.
[00:15:08.368 --> 00:15:08.809]  That's okay.
[00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:17.939]  Years ago in Austin, there was an article in the Statesman where they were telling us, and they weren't joking, that if your kid goes over to the new kid's house and there's a
[00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:21.081]  Rusty Flintlock on the top of the fireplace?
[00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:26.004]  You need to maybe think about talking to the kids' parents, because there's a gun in the house.
[00:15:26.064 --> 00:15:27.885]  I mean, they do this kind of thing all the time.
[00:15:27.925 --> 00:15:30.887]  Well, there's all these women that make men they marry get their guns out of the house.
[00:15:30.907 --> 00:15:32.488]  Let me explain something.
[00:15:32.528 --> 00:15:37.230]  Number one, I wouldn't marry a woman like that who couldn't protect my children, who's been totally defanged.
[00:15:37.411 --> 00:15:45.816]  That's not feminism, having these knock-kneed, cowardly women that salivate when they see a black uniform and a ski mask, but hate it when they see a citizen owning a gun.
[00:15:46.596 --> 00:15:47.957]  I mean, it's amazing, but look right here.
[00:15:49.137 --> 00:15:51.139]  Oh, for your safety.
[00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:53.200]  Oh, it may cause death.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.300]  No problem.
[00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:56.942]  We're going to kill you with the government.
[00:15:57.782 --> 00:15:58.182]  Look at this.
[00:15:58.262 --> 00:16:00.324]  New taser weapons produced for crowd control.
[00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:05.446]  Here's the new mass taser the taser is putting out for police to just zap whole crowds of people.
[00:16:05.807 --> 00:16:07.908]  And it can kill you, but you know.
[00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:09.726]  It's alright.
[00:16:09.746 --> 00:16:12.989]  They say that being shocked by it isn't the reason you die.
[00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:14.170]  It's just a new phenomenon.
[00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.532]  They're not sure why when you're electrocuted you die.
[00:16:18.428 --> 00:16:24.491]  Well, meanwhile, while they're doing this, they're continuing to build their next superhighway and try to toll everything.
[00:16:24.511 --> 00:16:26.512]  We're going to cover that when we get back and take calls, but look at this.
[00:16:26.572 --> 00:16:27.652]  We can all be tracked.
[00:16:27.973 --> 00:16:30.794]  Cops test license plate cameras that store and trace data.
[00:16:30.894 --> 00:16:33.495]  I told people a decade ago about this, Bob, from the federal grants.
[00:16:34.035 --> 00:16:41.839]  Everywhere you go, even in the middle of the countryside, it's all recorded and it's all kept in a database and your tax money pays for the giant hard drives to save it.
[00:16:42.639 --> 00:16:44.280]  Everyone's being tracked everywhere.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:50.445]  And you said that a million years ago, but the newspaper said it was just for traffic enforcement and things like that.
[00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:52.607]  But now they're announcing, oh, the feds with a grant!
[00:16:53.027 --> 00:16:56.530]  See, they build these emergency management centers, then every few months they go, oh, there's a new upgrade!
[00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:11.202]  You can type in Alex Jones' social security number and driver's license and it pops up where he's at, even when my cell phone is off, it has GPS triangulation, real-time, they know where I am.
[00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.149]  And it's the same thing with this real-time.
[00:17:14.229 --> 00:17:15.150]  All Pentagon design.
[00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:15.770]  It's all admitted.
[00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:30.492]  It's, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it,
[00:17:40.623 --> 00:17:42.484]  That's why I don't even usually carry my cell phone on anymore.
[00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:43.865]  Happen to have it today.
[00:17:43.885 --> 00:17:46.387]  Notice I don't have the newest trendy.
[00:17:46.407 --> 00:17:48.809]  I have a three-year-old cell phone.
[00:17:48.849 --> 00:17:50.009]  I'm not stylish.
[00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.891]  Alright, Bob Dacey, stay there.
[00:17:51.911 --> 00:17:52.451]  We're gonna come back.
[00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:54.473]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:17:54.653 --> 00:17:56.094]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:17:56.414 --> 00:17:58.635]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:17:59.096 --> 00:18:03.839]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:18:04.219 --> 00:18:07.061]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:18:07.421 --> 00:18:08.122]  Acolablue.

[00:18:27.596 --> 00:18:33.039]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services and storing five-gallon bottles of water in your home.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.963]  The Ecola Blue 28 is shipped right to your home ready to make close to seven gallons a day
[00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:43.245]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:18:43.265 --> 00:18:44.366]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:19:02.589 --> 00:19:03.430]  Who is the enemy?
[00:19:03.951 --> 00:19:04.492]  Bin Laden.
[00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:05.733]  This is his M.O.
[00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:07.055]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:08.757]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:19:09.117 --> 00:19:15.865]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:19:16.265 --> 00:19:16.706]  Some U.S.
[00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:22.433]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:19:23.093 --> 00:19:26.614]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:19:26.975 --> 00:19:36.838]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:19:37.058 --> 00:19:37.819]  Fabled enemies.

[00:19:53.556 --> 00:19:53.996]  Attention.

[00:20:04.463 --> 00:20:05.104]  Here is why.
[00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:15.919]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest and food shortages here in the U.S.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.802]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:20:19.122 --> 00:20:21.204]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:20:21.244 --> 00:20:21.724]  this fall?
[00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:22.725]  Don't wait.
[00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:26.768]  Learn the food shortage skills that can keep you and your family alive in a crisis.

[00:20:47.717 --> 00:20:47.937]  Act now!
[00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:07.560]  Alright, Sean, Eddie, Jimmy, Matthew, David and others, your calls are coming up.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.162]  Bob, let's...
[00:21:09.687 --> 00:21:14.871]  You know, one big part of this globalization is 83 major federal highways.
[00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:16.552]  They're going to make international zones.
[00:21:16.572 --> 00:21:23.438]  You'll pay international taxes that go into the SPP, Security, Prosperity, North American Integration Fund.
[00:21:24.318 --> 00:21:29.643]  And through that fund, they will then expand, taking over other roads and paying off local communities.
[00:21:30.503 --> 00:21:33.606]  Robert Pasture, a few months ago, said, oh, the North American Union's dead.
[00:21:33.646 --> 00:21:35.267]  The people exposed it and didn't like it.
[00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:38.049]  But meanwhile, they are just rampaging forward with it.
[00:21:38.389 --> 00:21:38.950]  Bob Dasey.
[00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.110]  Well, here's the deal, Alex.
[00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:52.533]  You know, this financial catastrophe that we're going under right now has caused some of these people in their financing schemes to do a little bit more, to kind of come out of their closet more with some of their jacantery.
[00:21:53.073 --> 00:21:59.415]  And we have a deal here in Austin that's basically, it's kind of like a pattern for the whole nation
[00:21:59.955 --> 00:22:03.936]  You know, the federal money to pay for highways has been drying up on purpose.
[00:22:04.336 --> 00:22:05.317]  They've been taking it away.
[00:22:05.517 --> 00:22:09.278]  They've been funding their north-south corridors for quite some time now.
[00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:14.059]  And so that forces the local people to try to scramble for more money to do the local projects.
[00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:19.421]  And, of course, Austin, Texas is kind of like the pilot project for the whole thing.
[00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:22.902]  And so what you've got here is you've got
[00:22:23.402 --> 00:22:30.204]  All these toll roads, all this toll stuff going on, which is not technically the Trans-Texas Corridor, or not technically the Napa Superhighway.
[00:22:30.705 --> 00:22:37.027]  So, what they tell you, that you've got this local control now, you'll be able to control it with your local officials.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:44.289]  Well, last year we had a big fight in Texas, and we kind of put a weak moratorium on the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:22:44.509 --> 00:22:49.291]  That was House Bill 792, I believe, Lois Kulkars was doing, and she's a good egg, by the way.
[00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:53.314]  But now we have a case in point here in Austin, which is nationally important.
[00:22:53.334 --> 00:23:02.860]  You've got the local board, which is called the Campo Board, which is going to, apparently, they had a vote last year to toll some roads around here, right?
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.702]  Okay, but we told them we didn't want to do it.
[00:23:06.582 --> 00:23:15.028]  Sarah Eckert, who was a county commissioner here in Austin, which replaced Karen Sundlantner, who we booted out because she was a toller, well, she kind of flip-flopped.
[00:23:15.048 --> 00:23:17.770]  She voted for the tolls, even though she said she wasn't a toller.
[00:23:18.317 --> 00:23:19.578]  You know, ask her, why'd you do that?
[00:23:19.858 --> 00:23:21.820]  And she said, well, because they blackmailed us.
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.606]  She said they promised us $900 million if we would toll the roads that we already paid for and, you know, improve.
[00:23:28.826 --> 00:23:31.648]  And they've already lied previously and said they were never going to put tolls on them.
[00:23:31.668 --> 00:23:33.890]  Yeah, and then they said they're going to give them $300 million if
[00:23:35.191 --> 00:23:36.633]  If they voted not to tell us.
[00:23:36.653 --> 00:23:44.500]  There's a $600 million blackmail, and she wanted to be able to... She knew the thing was going to pass anyway, so she voted for it so she could maybe try to manipulate it a little.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.825]  Well, she's kind of redeeming herself now, trying to, because there's a meeting tonight.
[00:23:49.885 --> 00:23:53.648]  This kind of got sprung on us, and I know you've got an international audience.
[00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:58.092]  This is just another co-op meeting.
[00:23:58.132 --> 00:24:11.342]  You've got thousands of your listeners listening right now that are in the Central Texas area, and there's a meeting tonight at the Josie Thompson Conference Center, University of Texas, at 6 o'clock, down there at UT, where they always have it, Dean Keaton and Red River.
[00:24:11.382 --> 00:24:12.223]  And what is this meeting?
[00:24:12.383 --> 00:24:14.264]  And this meeting is what they're doing.
[00:24:15.044 --> 00:24:23.689]  In the bill, 792, they said, listen, if you're going to build a toll road, we want local control, and we want to do a study to make sure it's financially viable.
[00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:30.793]  Well, they did a study on tolling this road 290 East, and the study said it's not financially viable.
[00:24:30.873 --> 00:24:31.433]  It's in the red.
[00:24:31.473 --> 00:24:32.254]  It's not going to work.
[00:24:32.914 --> 00:24:44.640]  So now the Campo Board is meeting to try to say, well, we found a loophole where we can vote not to make it market viable, and we can use money from another toll road to pay for it.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.581]  It's a big con job.
[00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:49.063]  I'm going to say something about the locals and everybody else.
[00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:54.725]  They're all great people, stalwarts, but we have to go through this relearning process every time and we never learn.
[00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:56.907]  Everything they say is lies.
[00:24:57.427 --> 00:24:58.888]  It's a criminal group taking over.
[00:24:59.768 --> 00:25:05.111]  They've said ten times that they weren't going to put toll roads in as they pass the authority for it.
[00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:09.273]  And so then we always get caught in the minutia of proving that they lie.
[00:25:09.333 --> 00:25:11.034]  But you've got to get down there and fight.
[00:25:11.154 --> 00:25:12.434]  You've got to get down there and fight.
[00:25:12.574 --> 00:25:20.678]  And if people show up tonight... I'm not saying people shouldn't go, but go realizing, just to tell them we know you're liars, we know you're taking over, we know this is all a scam.
[00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:22.979]  I mean, what's the point?
[00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:24.760]  And Eckert actually has admitted it.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.922]  She says the commitment to local control is lip service.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.167]  Well, of course it is, though.
[00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.158]  It's all a political process to stall.
[00:25:33.971 --> 00:25:35.451]  We'll just keep going there in this segment.
[00:25:36.631 --> 00:25:39.012]  I mean, Bob, we can talk about this local stuff all day long.
[00:25:39.572 --> 00:25:43.813]  And we have fought them, we have politically exposed them, and people have done a great job.
[00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:48.253]  But you can have 1,400 people at a meeting stomping, shaking the building, and they still vote against you.
[00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:49.874]  They're still moving forward.
[00:25:50.274 --> 00:25:56.555]  The legislature can pass a law saying that Rick Perry can't toll existing roads, and he just overrides it criminally.
[00:25:56.795 --> 00:26:03.916]  He goes to Bilderberg Group to meet with indicted members of the Bilderberg Group that are involved grabbing TXU and grabbing roads and infrastructure.
[00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:07.118]  I would bring up all the old lies, because we always focus on the new ones.
[00:26:07.138 --> 00:26:12.622]  Why not bring up the fact that they swore none of these roads were going to be toll roads to begin with?
[00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:34.178]  Well yeah, they did that, and they also swore that they were never told the interstates, and we blew the cover on that one last year.
[00:26:34.218 --> 00:26:36.219]  I was very proud of that.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.863]  There are a bunch of liars, and the more people realize it, the more they wake up.
[00:26:39.883 --> 00:26:44.627]  We're going to come back to the full audience in about 10 seconds, and plug when the meeting is again.
[00:26:44.647 --> 00:26:50.011]  I think people should go out to it, but just believe nothing they say, because all they do is lie.
[00:26:50.352 --> 00:26:51.052]  Here we go.
[00:26:56.795 --> 00:27:02.199]  Okay, we're looking at the local level of what's happening from Indiana to New Jersey.
[00:27:02.219 --> 00:27:04.181]  It's happening in Canada.
[00:27:04.221 --> 00:27:05.382]  It's happening in England, everywhere.
[00:27:05.802 --> 00:27:07.464]  They put transponders in your cars.
[00:27:07.504 --> 00:27:10.506]  They tax you upwards of six, seven dollars a mile in some cases.
[00:27:10.926 --> 00:27:13.068]  They track everywhere you go with the transponders.
[00:27:13.468 --> 00:27:15.130]  The money goes to offshore corporations.
[00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.251]  These offshore corporations only loot.
[00:27:17.271 --> 00:27:22.375]  They only come in and get already built or already paid for roads, and then they just slap toll roads on it.
[00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:24.137]  Coming into Austin off of 183,
[00:27:25.898 --> 00:27:32.421]  Uh, back from Denver, I know that it says pay cash here and then a hundred yards later makes you get off and says only transponders allowed.
[00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:34.681]  So it's also another big scam and a joke there.
[00:27:35.502 --> 00:27:37.182]  They swore none of this was even happening.
[00:27:37.603 --> 00:27:40.704]  As the toll roads go in, they keep saying that those roads don't even exist.
[00:27:41.144 --> 00:27:44.205]  I mean, I mean, that's the level of lying for the sheeple out there.
[00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:46.426]  Uh, but, uh, where is it going?
[00:27:46.906 --> 00:27:49.429]  I mean, I know a little bit about this, but Bob, you're more up-to-date on it.
[00:27:49.989 --> 00:27:59.078]  We are having victories, though, thanks to people in Texas, you know, with them claiming they weren't going to toll existing interstate highways and state roads, but now they have to admit they are planning that.
[00:27:59.118 --> 00:27:59.819]  Where is that going?
[00:28:00.592 --> 00:28:03.574]  Well, where that's going is, I don't know.
[00:28:03.634 --> 00:28:10.878]  I mean, I heard that Senator Hutchison came out last year and said she was going to introduce a bill to stop the practice nationwide.
[00:28:11.198 --> 00:28:15.300]  And then Bush signed an executive order saying, federally, we're going to hand the roads over.
[00:28:15.441 --> 00:28:17.222]  You know, it's a big crook-fist.
[00:28:18.122 --> 00:28:26.407]  And you're right, Alex, you can't trust them as far as you can throw them, but anything we can do, anything we can do to throw stuff and taxes... What is she doing at this co-op meeting?
[00:28:26.787 --> 00:28:28.589]  How are they trying to co-opt, everybody?
[00:28:28.629 --> 00:28:47.086]  What they're trying to do, without public hearing, they're trying to circumvent the legislative intent of the Texas Legislature, which says that these toll roads have to be commercially viable, and they have to pay for themselves, and any money that they make is supposed to stay right there on the toll road.
[00:28:47.506 --> 00:28:58.495]  What they're trying to do is say, well no, we found out that this particular project is not commercially viable, therefore we don't care, we want to do a waiver so that the bankers will loan us the money.
[00:29:02.979 --> 00:29:06.364]  While we're talking about this, you're not just saying Austin's the battleground.
[00:29:06.624 --> 00:29:11.911]  They have said federally and internationally and at toll road conferences that Austin is the model.
[00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:13.874]  They're learning.
[00:29:13.894 --> 00:29:15.696]  They're studying how to buy off politicians.
[00:29:15.716 --> 00:29:16.837]  They're studying how to lie.
[00:29:17.138 --> 00:29:18.680]  They're studying how to play all the games.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.761]  So it is a key battleground.
[00:29:20.282 --> 00:29:35.270]  That's why any listeners that are in the Central Texas area need to be at this Josie Thompson Conference Center at 6 o'clock tonight on the UT campus and go against this Campo board out of number 7 and tell them, no, don't vote for it!
[00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.032]  You're circumventing the legislative intent!
[00:29:38.052 --> 00:29:40.153]  And this is the supposed locals that have authority!
[00:29:40.453 --> 00:29:43.655]  Yes, supposedly, and I've said forever that it's a sham!
[00:29:43.675 --> 00:29:48.499]  Now I know some of the board's new, but last time I checked, a bunch of them wives and husbands work for the toll company?
[00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:49.079]  I don't know.
[00:29:49.139 --> 00:29:55.124]  I know that Kirk Watson is the one sitting on top of it, and he is the United Nations Global Whip Envoy.
[00:29:55.184 --> 00:29:57.706]  And he also owns a bank here in Texas handing over
[00:29:58.146 --> 00:30:03.031]  Yeah, I understand that he's not going to be able to vote because he owns a bank that has something to do with it.
[00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:04.413]  Yeah, with the real estate and the roads.
[00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:08.036]  Yeah, well, you know, can you imagine a conflict of interest amongst these people?
[00:30:08.077 --> 00:30:11.660]  It's like Goldman Sachs openly handing money to itself out of the bailout.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.582]  Can you believe that guy's name is Cash Carry?
[00:30:14.243 --> 00:30:20.750]  I mean, really, they take the cash from us and they carry it over to Goldman Sachs and they say, here, you figure out what to do with this money.
[00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:25.492]  It's crazy, but anyway, y'all got to be there if you're in Central Texas or I'm going to be ashamed of you.
[00:30:25.653 --> 00:30:26.193]  You know what, Bob?
[00:30:26.213 --> 00:30:27.373]  Just plug it over and over again.
[00:30:27.394 --> 00:30:28.314]  Just say it five more times.
[00:30:28.374 --> 00:30:29.695]  Alright, one or two more times.
[00:30:29.775 --> 00:30:33.557]  Campo Board Meeting tonight, October the 13th, 6 p.m.
[00:30:34.297 --> 00:30:37.199]  at the Josie Thompson Conference Center, University of Texas campus.
[00:30:37.299 --> 00:30:38.860]  Dean Keaton at Red River Streets.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:44.243]  Get over there because they sprung this on us and they're trying to be no public input.
[00:30:44.283 --> 00:30:44.763]  Plug it again.
[00:30:45.003 --> 00:30:51.144]  Alright, one more time, just because repetition overcomes noise in the communications channel, I learned that.
[00:30:51.764 --> 00:31:08.588]  Tonight, 6 o'clock, Josie Thompson Conference Center, University of Texas campus, Dean Keating at Red River, any of you listening out there, you've got to get over there by 6 o'clock and tell them no on item 7, where they're trying to circumvent the intent of the legislature.
[00:31:08.988 --> 00:31:10.951]  It's just best to let them know you're fully aware of their operations.
[00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:16.758]  And by the way, this is the same sort of financial nonsense that's got us in trouble nationwide, all this ridiculous stuff.
[00:31:16.778 --> 00:31:18.400]  They say, well, the economics don't work.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.961]  Well, let's just do it anyway!
[00:31:19.981 --> 00:31:22.124]  Because the bankers paid us off!
[00:31:22.204 --> 00:31:26.509]  We need the cheaper bonds from the New York bankers, so let's con everybody.
[00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:36.835]  What happens, they get the counties and cities pimped out, like a heroin dealer does, an addict, you know, totally strung out, and then they say, okay, just like what the IMF and World Bank does in third world countries.
[00:31:37.175 --> 00:31:39.856]  They say, you've got to do this hundred and something things we say.
[00:31:40.156 --> 00:31:42.917]  Hand over your water, hand over your roads, you've got to privatize it.
[00:31:43.218 --> 00:31:45.179]  And the privatization just means handing it over.
[00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:48.140]  It doesn't mean they're even taking responsibility for it.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.202]  Okay, I promise, your phone calls on the economy and a lot more with Bob Dasey.
[00:31:53.117 --> 00:31:59.502]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:31:59.862 --> 00:32:01.844]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:32:02.525 --> 00:32:03.545]  But who is the enemy?
[00:32:04.066 --> 00:32:04.586]  Bin Laden.
[00:32:04.866 --> 00:32:05.667]  This is his ammo.
[00:32:05.687 --> 00:32:07.168]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:08.890]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:15.975]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:32:16.376 --> 00:32:16.816]  Some U.S.
[00:32:16.856 --> 00:32:22.521]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:26.642]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:32:26.662 --> 00:32:29.483]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:32:52.890 --> 00:33:01.294]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[00:33:01.595 --> 00:33:07.257]  At HempUSA.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.
[00:33:07.578 --> 00:33:14.041]  At HempUSA.org we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is certified THC-free.
[00:33:14.682 --> 00:33:17.946]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[00:33:18.067 --> 00:33:20.309]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.

[00:33:54.144 --> 00:34:08.154]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed or where we might end up.
[00:34:08.315 --> 00:34:15.500]  And she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:16.000]  We're good to go!
[00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:31.979]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[00:34:31.999 --> 00:34:32.800]  Do what I did.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.460]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:37.242]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[00:34:37.362 --> 00:34:39.162]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.
[00:34:39.222 --> 00:34:40.663]  Put a little security in your life.
[00:34:40.803 --> 00:34:41.883]  You deserve security.
[00:34:41.963 --> 00:34:42.964]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:34:42.984 --> 00:34:43.584]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:34:43.604 --> 00:34:43.684]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:34:43.704 --> 00:34:44.184]  Put some food away.
[00:34:44.204 --> 00:34:44.524]  Do it now.
[00:34:44.544 --> 00:34:44.604]  1-800-409-5633.
[00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:45.105]  Big Brother.
[00:34:58.857 --> 00:35:00.658]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:35:28.147 --> 00:35:29.388]  I just wanted to call in.
[00:35:29.748 --> 00:35:33.130]  You asked about what we're doing with the current economy and stuff.
[00:35:34.631 --> 00:35:37.353]  Started raising some rabbits and we're going to be raising some chickens.
[00:35:38.014 --> 00:35:38.714]  Talking to people.
[00:35:39.595 --> 00:35:46.279]  Wait, do you have an animal premises ID and federal tax that isn't the law but they threaten you with so they can shut down your small farmer ranch?
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.942]  Did you get a special permit from the government slave?
[00:35:50.782 --> 00:35:51.683]  Yeah, you bet I did.
[00:35:52.243 --> 00:35:53.204]  Good, good slave.
[00:35:55.666 --> 00:35:57.587]  Moved out of the cities, moved out into the country.
[00:35:57.808 --> 00:35:59.169]  Oh, that sounds like Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:00.750]  Sounds Al-Qaeda-ish.
[00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:03.151]  You planted something sacred out there?
[00:36:03.672 --> 00:36:05.053]  Got evil firearms?
[00:36:07.034 --> 00:36:07.795]  I plead the fifth.
[00:36:08.395 --> 00:36:10.417]  How dare you, boy?
[00:36:11.257 --> 00:36:12.738]  You must hate the government.
[00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:15.060]  I'm getting to be that way.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.441]  What makes the grass grow?
[00:36:16.481 --> 00:36:17.202]  The government.
[00:36:17.902 --> 00:36:19.503]  What makes the water rain?
[00:36:19.523 --> 00:36:22.766]  The government.
[00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:24.487]  You were trying to figure out who it was that said,
[00:36:25.772 --> 00:36:27.393]  We make money the old-fashioned way we earn it.
[00:36:27.433 --> 00:36:28.253]  That was Smith Barney.
[00:36:29.213 --> 00:36:30.514]  Yeah, Smith Barney.
[00:36:30.614 --> 00:36:33.015]  We make money the old-fashioned way we steal it.
[00:36:33.035 --> 00:36:35.195]  We print it at the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:35.215 --> 00:36:40.137]  So, hey, I just wanted to thank you for opening my eyes.
[00:36:40.277 --> 00:36:43.398]  It's been about six months now, so that was pretty quick.
[00:36:44.919 --> 00:36:45.479]  So, thank you.
[00:36:46.259 --> 00:36:48.700]  Shawn, good to have you listening to the show.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.460]  Anything else?
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:54.962]  I appreciate... I mean, what's the economy like in Minnesota overall?
[00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.391]  Bob, you keep wondering why your phone's ringing.
[00:36:58.411 --> 00:36:59.472]  It's because you don't turn it off.
[00:36:59.652 --> 00:37:00.392]  I know, I don't.
[00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:03.174]  You just leave it on, and oh, it rang again!
[00:37:03.234 --> 00:37:04.554]  Nobody ever calls me, Alex.
[00:37:04.614 --> 00:37:05.155]  That's the thing.
[00:37:05.255 --> 00:37:07.016]  They just wait while I'm on the show to call me.
[00:37:07.096 --> 00:37:09.377]  I guarantee you, it's people calling up wanting you to plug stuff on the show.
[00:37:09.397 --> 00:37:10.277]  Well, that's not going to happen.
[00:37:11.218 --> 00:37:12.178]  Food prices are going up.
[00:37:12.799 --> 00:37:17.341]  Gases, let's see, it was $2.97 or $2.79 right now.
[00:37:18.602 --> 00:37:24.945]  But I was looking at the oil, the price of crude oil, and I remember Lindsey Williams, you had him on a couple of months ago.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.642]  I'm talking gas or oil going to $50 a barrel.
[00:37:29.263 --> 00:37:30.463]  Everything he said happened.
[00:37:30.503 --> 00:37:32.825]  In fact, get Lindsey Williams back on the show.
[00:37:32.965 --> 00:37:33.445]  Write that down.
[00:37:33.485 --> 00:37:36.667]  I know Trey's having a meeting across the street with the guys.
[00:37:37.348 --> 00:37:42.331]  I'm glad you mentioned that thing, the new weapon from Taser, the crowd control.
[00:37:42.692 --> 00:37:45.433]  I looked at that and showed that to my wife and my brother.
[00:37:45.533 --> 00:37:49.736]  But if anybody dies when they happen to get shocked with it, it has nothing to do with electricity.
[00:37:50.277 --> 00:37:50.997]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:51.017 --> 00:37:51.958]  It's a new phenomenon.
[00:37:53.174 --> 00:37:56.037]  Or the bullets they can shoot out of a 12 gauge now, too.
[00:37:56.898 --> 00:37:57.979]  Effective at 100 yards.
[00:37:58.399 --> 00:37:58.560]  Yep.
[00:37:59.781 --> 00:38:00.361]  Unbelievable.
[00:38:00.762 --> 00:38:01.302]  Unbelievable.
[00:38:01.482 --> 00:38:04.806]  Well, thanks for what you're doing, Alex, and keep up the good work.
[00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:05.326]  You bet.
[00:38:05.346 --> 00:38:07.308]  Yeah, that's the threat continuum, you know.
[00:38:07.468 --> 00:38:10.111]  Oh, well, one person got out of line at a demonstration.
[00:38:10.151 --> 00:38:16.357]  Now we get to shower the whole crowd, including women with baby strollers and infants, with Taser bullets.
[00:38:17.137 --> 00:38:19.600]  And don't forget the new preferred method of suicide.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.722]  Wrapping yourself with duct tape and jumping in the lake.
[00:38:21.982 --> 00:38:22.522]  Don't forget that.
[00:38:22.622 --> 00:38:23.864]  And slicing your whole body up.
[00:38:23.924 --> 00:38:24.184]  Right.
[00:38:24.284 --> 00:38:24.845]  Don't forget that.
[00:38:25.105 --> 00:38:27.307]  That's the new preferred... It's obviously a suicide, right?
[00:38:27.347 --> 00:38:28.008]  Here in Austin.
[00:38:28.028 --> 00:38:28.588]  Here in Austin.
[00:38:28.608 --> 00:38:31.351]  I mean, you know, there's some new stuff going on out there.
[00:38:31.431 --> 00:38:32.051]  That's one of them.
[00:38:32.812 --> 00:38:33.493]  Everything's fine.
[00:38:34.574 --> 00:38:36.255]  Let's talk to Eddie in California.
[00:38:36.315 --> 00:38:37.056]  Eddie, you're on the air.
[00:38:37.096 --> 00:38:37.496]  Go ahead.
[00:38:37.877 --> 00:38:38.357]  Hey, Alex.
[00:38:38.457 --> 00:38:39.618]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:38:40.519 --> 00:38:41.360]  Thank you for calling, sir.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.021]  What's on your mind?
[00:38:43.284 --> 00:38:46.446]  Yeah, it's funny you guys are talking about these toll roads.
[00:38:47.366 --> 00:39:02.532]  I traveled extensively throughout China, and in the town I was staying, Farm Town, they actually built a toll road between the city where the farmers went to and sold their goods, and that town.
[00:39:04.654 --> 00:39:08.697]  Of course the farmers don't like it, because... Because they're with Al-Qaeda!
[00:39:09.098 --> 00:39:11.279]  Anybody who doesn't like what the government's doing is with Al-Qaeda!
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.960]  It needs to be tasered!
[00:39:13.221 --> 00:39:20.166]  Actually, since I do go to China, I am a communist, so... Well, you're against the bankers taking over, so you're a communist.
[00:39:20.226 --> 00:39:22.227]  I'm against the bankers, yes, I'm a communist.
[00:39:22.387 --> 00:39:23.488]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:39:23.508 --> 00:39:27.291]  As a matter of fact, every time I come back to Newcastle, they always ask me what I was doing in China.
[00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:28.912]  Very suspicious.
[00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:31.174]  Well, if you're a communist, that means you're going to vote for Obama, right?
[00:39:32.457 --> 00:39:33.117]  Absolutely.
[00:39:35.038 --> 00:39:40.259]  But anyway, like the difference there, because some people are living with pennies anyway.
[00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:44.460]  You know, I mean, a dollar means that someone's going to eat or not.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.741]  I mean, this toll road literally, I mean, took that away.
[00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:58.523]  So these farmers literally went out with torches and pitchforks, went to the toll booth where like a police station, a little police station was set up and all of that.
[00:39:59.079 --> 00:40:03.240]  And burned it down, and got all the police and military out of there.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.261]  And nothing happened to them.
[00:40:05.401 --> 00:40:06.461]  Well, let me break this down.
[00:40:07.621 --> 00:40:15.663]  In China, in Beijing, they put up a few hundred cameras last year, and the public just climbed the poles and tore them down, and the cops couldn't do anything.
[00:40:16.064 --> 00:40:25.186]  And there are videos all over YouTube, shot by camera phones, where they'll show people with pitchforks and hammers and rakes, attacking police that are shooting them with machine guns.
[00:40:25.706 --> 00:40:34.869]  And the people overrun them, kill them, burn out the police station, and all over China, there's maps online, there are whole cities and towns taken back by the people.
[00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.991]  And they'll try to have the army march in and they'll basically say no.
[00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:41.532]  So yes, they are more spirit of 1776 than we are.
[00:40:43.633 --> 00:40:52.556]  I'm not saying, I mean, yeah, that's right, but I'm saying too, I mean, what I don't understand is how the bankers are going to bankrupt us, take away the middle class,
[00:40:53.288 --> 00:40:55.369]  Expect us not to start paying attention.
[00:40:55.409 --> 00:40:57.410]  Well, we're trained to grovel to the government.
[00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:58.911]  The Chinese have always rebelled.
[00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:08.275]  That's why Mao and the CIA funding, they tricked them into getting behind kicking out Chiang Kai-shek, which our government did, while telling the public we were for Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists.
[00:41:09.095 --> 00:41:11.676]  Here, I have to tell you, we are domesticated.
[00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.677]  We got something more important than that, though.
[00:41:13.697 --> 00:41:14.317]  See, that's the deal.
[00:41:14.357 --> 00:41:15.078]  We got football.
[00:41:15.578 --> 00:41:15.778]  Yeah.
[00:41:16.383 --> 00:41:18.607]  I mean, Texas beat OU, so everything's alright.
[00:41:19.067 --> 00:41:20.870]  Oh, you may be going into a depression.
[00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:22.373]  It was even on the local news.
[00:41:22.814 --> 00:41:28.022]  Hundreds of cars, they would wave them in to parking lots and tell them free parking and then tow them all.
[00:41:28.763 --> 00:41:30.246]  See, everything's going corrupt.
[00:41:31.277 --> 00:41:32.879]  But you know, that's what I'm saying.
[00:41:32.899 --> 00:41:39.166]  The Chinese don't have football, so they've got nothing to distract their... Yeah, so what?
[00:41:39.646 --> 00:41:44.532]  We'll probably all be homeless and have no future, and they're building family camps, but them cowboys, now they lost!
[00:41:44.732 --> 00:41:45.853]  Boy, they screwed up, didn't they?
[00:41:46.073 --> 00:41:49.257]  I tell you what, boy, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:41:49.997 --> 00:41:55.240]  Yeah, but my longhorns... My manliness ain't feeling too good right now.
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.901]  But my longhorns won, and I like that.
[00:41:58.162 --> 00:42:06.306]  I hate to admit it, but... Hey, just because you're fighting the New World Order doesn't mean you can't watch the football game here once in a while.
[00:42:06.366 --> 00:42:07.467]  Listen, listen.
[00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:08.607]  Eddie, I appreciate your call.
[00:42:09.428 --> 00:42:09.848]  Take care.
[00:42:09.928 --> 00:42:10.868]  Jimmy in Arkansas.
[00:42:11.289 --> 00:42:12.109]  Jimmy, you're on the air.
[00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:15.011]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:42:16.243 --> 00:42:18.483]  I want to touch on this martial law business.
[00:42:18.503 --> 00:42:19.244]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:42:19.284 --> 00:42:23.264]  I've got a lot of friends that are in the military and I'm a vet myself.
[00:42:45.945 --> 00:42:49.527]  And I think in the long run, it's not going to work.
[00:42:50.827 --> 00:43:01.672]  On the simple fact, I've talked to a few of them that are still in the military, and I've brought up the point to them, and, you know, there's scuttlebutt going on in the military about this martial law.
[00:43:01.692 --> 00:43:04.794]  Some of them, you know, are over here, you know, getting trained for it.
[00:43:05.894 --> 00:43:12.357]  But anyway, I've asked them a question that, okay, if they hear the catch,
[00:43:12.841 --> 00:43:13.242]  I think so.
[00:43:26.556 --> 00:43:33.420]  Back in your hometown, doing the same thing your mom, dad, brothers, sisters, whatever, that you're doing to people out there in California.
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:47.188]  No, that's it, and the Soviet Union, the Nazis, that's how it's all done, and they actually have public plans to do that, and they signed a deal this year, they really signed it seven years ago, but they made it public earlier this year, it was in the news, without Congress.
[00:43:47.228 --> 00:43:51.590]  Congress said, we weren't involved in that, why weren't we notified, you know, that's our authority.
[00:43:52.011 --> 00:43:53.912]  Used to, the Congress had to even commission an officer.
[00:43:54.392 --> 00:44:01.694]  You know, the executive couldn't even pick the officers, because an executive might try to set up martial law by putting his officers in, so separation of powers.
[00:44:02.054 --> 00:44:03.075]  Congress had to do that.
[00:44:03.795 --> 00:44:05.636]  Well, here was the Canadian, Mexican, and U.S.
[00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:11.498]  generals signing a North American Union pact to fight terrorists and for civil unrest.
[00:44:11.538 --> 00:44:12.478]  But here's the problem.
[00:44:13.098 --> 00:44:23.934]  We're not just going to send people out of Kentucky into Northern California, or people from Texas into Minnesota, or vice versa, or from Florida to Georgia or whatever.
[00:44:23.954 --> 00:44:24.855]  They're not just going to do that.
[00:44:26.127 --> 00:44:43.022]  What they're doing is they're going to create an economic implosion where through hyperinflation they're not going to increase the size of the welfare check or the social security check and people aren't going to have jobs on top of it and so even if they still get the checks they won't be able to buy what they need so the rioting will start and we'll see news images of scum
[00:44:44.318 --> 00:44:50.221]  Well, I think that might work to a point that you're still going to have this problem of just
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.021]  Out and out, you know, one American turning on another one, irregardless, you know.
[00:45:20.501 --> 00:45:36.284]  The military, your common, okay, they've been called every derogatory name in the book over the years, dogfaces, everything else, but when it comes right down to it, your average ground pounder, they're not stupid, by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:45:37.345 --> 00:45:43.486]  And they're going to be able to figure out that somebody, somewhere down the line, has gave an illegal order.
[00:45:44.781 --> 00:45:50.285]  And under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, you are not obligated to follow an illegal order.
[00:45:50.585 --> 00:45:51.746]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[00:45:51.786 --> 00:45:52.807]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:45:52.907 --> 00:45:54.628]  And again, I'm not playing devil's advocate.
[00:45:54.648 --> 00:45:58.251]  I'm saying how they're going to sell it, how they are selling it to the public.
[00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:09.039]  I don't think that they'll ever be able to overcome is just your out-and-out conscience.
[00:46:09.799 --> 00:46:12.201]  And trying to pit one American against another American
[00:46:14.338 --> 00:46:14.558]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:29.084]  After a while, it's going to start wearing off.
[00:46:29.164 --> 00:46:38.412]  No, I hear you, but I'm going to skip this break for PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and people listening on the InfoWars exclusive stream.
[00:46:38.472 --> 00:46:39.833]  Everybody else will be back in four minutes.
[00:46:40.234 --> 00:46:45.038]  Stay there because, Jimmy, I'm going to continue having this talk with him.
[00:46:45.058 --> 00:46:48.621]  We'll come back and go to Matthew, David, Ahmed, Ryan, and others.
[00:46:48.981 --> 00:46:50.262]  We're already under martial law.
[00:46:50.282 --> 00:46:51.784]  We're talking about hot martial law.
[00:46:53.226 --> 00:46:56.547]  Okay, we're going to go ahead and skip that break, John, thank you.
[00:46:58.027 --> 00:47:10.391]  My point is, what they're going to do is, Jimmy, and the military needs to know this now, they are going to stage strategic televised killings of troops trying to get food to rioting people.
[00:47:10.851 --> 00:47:17.833]  There are also regular scum out there who every time there's riots who shoot the firemen and police, you're going to have them as well.
[00:47:18.393 --> 00:47:20.874]  And so those incidents, just like in Seattle,
[00:47:21.354 --> 00:47:26.175]  They had all the riot police, the Delta Force and the Feds hired 50 thugs through a foundation.
[00:47:26.435 --> 00:47:27.555]  They let them attack police.
[00:47:27.575 --> 00:47:29.076]  The low-level cops didn't know what was happening.
[00:47:29.096 --> 00:47:31.056]  They pointed out, though, that they weren't allowed to arrest them.
[00:47:31.576 --> 00:47:39.318]  Then the 50 anarchists retired to a government-paid-for building under police guard, and the National News said, look, now the anarchists are going to be attacked by the police.
[00:47:39.738 --> 00:47:40.758]  You know, they waited a day.
[00:47:40.778 --> 00:47:43.019]  Well, the public said, somebody's got to do something here.
[00:47:43.039 --> 00:47:47.360]  Somebody's got to stand with these anarchists breaking out windows and attacking cops and doing all of this.
[00:47:48.459 --> 00:47:56.805]  And so then the cops were turned loose on the peaceful 60,000 people, beat old ladies with clubs, attacked them, went into neighborhoods, went into businesses.
[00:47:56.845 --> 00:47:58.426]  So it's the psychology.
[00:47:58.446 --> 00:48:12.095]  They're going to stage attacks on troops in the first stages of physical, hot martial law, not judicial or legislative or executive martial law through the courts, through corruption, you know, this incremental, but real martial law.
[00:48:12.455 --> 00:48:16.978]  They're going to stage events to psychologically get the military behind all of this.
[00:48:17.058 --> 00:48:18.219]  So how do you respond to that?
[00:48:19.579 --> 00:48:27.841]  Well, you got a good point there, a good valid point, but in this day and age, okay, you stop and think about it.
[00:48:28.041 --> 00:48:30.942]  This has been brought up repeatedly, all these cameras running around.
[00:48:31.422 --> 00:48:33.883]  Let's go back to that deal with you and Ms.
[00:48:33.923 --> 00:48:34.763]  Michelle Malcolm.
[00:48:36.443 --> 00:48:39.564]  They sat there and they said that you did this, that, and yada, yada, yada.
[00:48:40.308 --> 00:48:41.371]  And you didn't do that.
[00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:51.672]  And everybody and their dog anymore has some sort of video device, whether it be their cell phone or their Kodak digital camera, whatever.
[00:48:52.927 --> 00:48:55.629]  Somebody is going to get a picture of something somewhere.
[00:48:56.029 --> 00:48:56.430]  You know what?
[00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:57.771]  I agree with you and that's the answer.
[00:48:58.091 --> 00:49:00.453]  We just have to war game this out.
[00:49:00.953 --> 00:49:11.721]  Tell you, like war gaming a chess game, what their moves are going to be in this war game so we know how they're going to run this psychological warfare operation on the public, the military, the police and everybody.
[00:49:11.761 --> 00:49:14.182]  And I agree with you just like in Montebello earlier this year.
[00:49:14.983 --> 00:49:24.430]  We caught them and it ended up coming up on national news, the Patriot movement caught, police dressed like anarchists, attacking cops, staging their arrest, them being released, and the police had to admit they staged it.
[00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:26.572]  In Seattle, we expose it was staged.
[00:49:26.912 --> 00:49:38.641]  In other parts of the world, and so now people know and are looking for that, and you're right, in Minnesota they caught the cops staging some stuff, so you're right that the cat is out of the bag, so I agree with you.
[00:49:38.941 --> 00:49:41.783]  Last question for you, unless Bob has any for you, Jimmy, from Arkansas.
[00:49:42.203 --> 00:49:45.885]  I just wanted to say that that's what the info war is all about, isn't it Alex?
[00:49:46.345 --> 00:49:47.286]  That's why you're sitting there.
[00:49:47.626 --> 00:49:54.229]  Well, the main war is getting people to know history and know how these controllers operate so that we're not telling people what to think.
[00:49:54.269 --> 00:50:01.113]  We're teaching people how to open their eyes up and analyze things for themselves because light of day will bring this new world order down.
[00:50:01.133 --> 00:50:03.374]  But finishing up, Jimmy, you say scuttlebutt.
[00:50:03.414 --> 00:50:05.775]  I mean, they admit they're training the military, they're training the police.
[00:50:06.235 --> 00:50:10.879]  Yeah, they don't have a whole lot of faith in mainstream media at all because, you know, I've got a son in Iraq, somewhere over there.
[00:50:10.899 --> 00:50:11.839]  I worry about him every day.
[00:50:11.859 --> 00:50:15.362]  It makes me sick on the simple fact that he's over there,
[00:50:36.917 --> 00:50:42.023]  In Iraq, under the same guise that I was over in Vietnam.
[00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:43.485]  And it sucks.
[00:50:43.945 --> 00:50:45.227]  There ain't no other way to put it.
[00:50:46.228 --> 00:50:49.612]  Sorry about using that phrase on your radio, but anyway...
[00:51:04.378 --> 00:51:06.359]  We were just talking to Jimmy in Arkansas.
[00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:07.199]  He was in Vietnam.
[00:51:07.239 --> 00:51:08.180]  His son's in Iraq.
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:15.062]  And he was saying what he doesn't like is that the same criminal syndicate that was over him in Vietnam is over his son.
[00:51:15.662 --> 00:51:17.182]  And you know, that's the paradox here.
[00:51:17.222 --> 00:51:19.123]  The courage of the men and women in the uniform.
[00:51:19.403 --> 00:51:20.463]  The hell they go through.
[00:51:20.483 --> 00:51:21.083]  And what do they get?
[00:51:21.483 --> 00:51:23.024]  They get their medical treatment cut.
[00:51:23.404 --> 00:51:26.025]  The vets are having their treatment cut that was promised to them.
[00:51:26.105 --> 00:51:28.145]  They're shot up with all these experimental vaccines.
[00:51:28.526 --> 00:51:29.546]  Finish up your point, Jimmy.
[00:51:31.305 --> 00:51:35.728]  Anyway, the military doesn't really buy into mainstream media.
[00:51:35.768 --> 00:51:59.365]  They'll sit there and, like you said earlier, they'll deny that, oh, there's not any real urban training going on here or there or anywhere else, but when it's actually caught on somebody's private video device, and they put it on YouTube or Google or whatever, or put it in a blog,
[00:51:59.981 --> 00:52:07.303]  Well, I mean, obviously most of what they say is true, so that they can then trick you with a little bit of disinfo on key subjects they put out.
[00:52:27.765 --> 00:52:36.791]  Yeah, you know, you tell a whole lot of truths, and throw in a couple or three lies, you know, it's kind of hard to sort out what's fact and what's fiction.
[00:52:37.492 --> 00:52:41.675]  Yeah, it creates a haze of not knowing.
[00:52:42.035 --> 00:52:49.661]  Well, I'll say that, you know, in their defense of the mainstream media, they are very, very good at sports scores and are not too bad at weather.
[00:52:49.961 --> 00:52:51.302]  Well, see, they're not lying about those things.
[00:52:51.322 --> 00:52:51.582]  That's right.
[00:52:53.103 --> 00:52:54.384]  They spin everything else.
[00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:55.064]  That's the problem.
[00:52:55.084 --> 00:52:56.485]  It's not even lying most of the time, it's spinning.
[00:52:57.186 --> 00:52:58.667]  Or it's lying by omission.
[00:52:58.687 --> 00:52:59.347]  I mean, here's the thing.
[00:52:59.807 --> 00:53:08.913]  I'd go to an urban warfare drill in Temple, or an urban warfare drill in California, or an urban warfare drill somewhere else, and I would witness the troops training for America on video, saying, where are you from?
[00:53:08.973 --> 00:53:09.894]  I'm from San Francisco.
[00:53:09.914 --> 00:53:10.654]  Where'd you get the gun?
[00:53:10.674 --> 00:53:14.917]  Where'd you get the... And then I'd see Marines doing real checkpoints with police helping them arrest people.
[00:53:15.357 --> 00:53:16.458]  And then I'd come back and then I'd...
[00:53:16.678 --> 00:53:28.606]  I'd be at the event, and I'd see CNN there, and I'd watch the CNN report, and they'd say, the Marines were doing urban warfare drills for Central Asia in the future, and of course, for Macedonia.
[00:53:28.926 --> 00:53:34.650]  And in a way, it's true, because it's dual-use training, but the main function was for the United States.
[00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:41.174]  So see, that's how you know they're lying, because we just showed people the video of what the Marines were actually saying.
[00:53:41.534 --> 00:53:46.557]  Same thing happened here in Austin today, in the local paper, that Campo thing I'm talking about.
[00:53:46.918 --> 00:53:51.241]  They discussed it, but they brought up some other non-issue, and they left alone the big one.
[00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:52.682]  They lie by omission.
[00:53:52.722 --> 00:53:59.606]  Yeah, they'll talk about, oh, the Campo board is meeting to discuss the future of this little side issue, and they never discuss it.
[00:53:59.626 --> 00:54:01.648]  It's about tolling roads they swore they wouldn't toll.
[00:54:01.788 --> 00:54:03.349]  Right, they lie by omission.
[00:54:03.369 --> 00:54:11.054]  They bring up something minor, they won't cover the stuff that matters, and therefore, hey, you keep sucking up the mainstream media, you keep getting fed garbage.
[00:54:11.754 --> 00:54:13.275]  Hey, listen, anything else you want to add, Jimmy?
[00:54:14.436 --> 00:54:15.157]  Uh, yeah, I would.
[00:54:15.237 --> 00:54:18.819]  It's a little off the subject, but this is just mainly for the listeners.
[00:54:18.899 --> 00:54:21.421]  But, you know, okay, I'm disabled.
[00:54:21.441 --> 00:54:29.006]  There's not a whole lot I can do in the movement, but what little I do do, I make a lot of DVDs, for God's sake, do that, and pass them out.
[00:54:29.306 --> 00:54:37.152]  And also, you can get on the Internet, bookstore, wherever, and you can get these little pocket copies of the Constitution of the United States.
[00:54:37.873 --> 00:54:46.656]  Buy as many of them as you can and pass them out freely and get people to understand that that is what they're... We didn't hang up on you, sir.
[00:54:48.597 --> 00:54:49.117]  Oh, he's back.
[00:54:49.217 --> 00:54:49.697]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:54:51.838 --> 00:54:54.419]  No, I... Yeah, Jimmy, your phone cut out for a minute.
[00:54:54.439 --> 00:54:54.999]  You're still there.
[00:54:55.859 --> 00:55:05.503]  Oh, well, I was just saying, everybody, if they'd just pass out their... pass out the DVDs, like Loose Change and things like that, in-game, and get Pocket...
[00:55:07.705 --> 00:55:14.629]  A little pocket copies of the Constitution and pass those out freely and get people to understand that the Constitution still has clout.
[00:55:15.209 --> 00:55:19.471]  It has nothing to do with that Patriot Act was just a bunch of garbage.
[00:55:21.038 --> 00:55:22.979]  The word will get out, and hopefully.
[00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.399]  I've changed a lot of minds myself.
[00:55:24.439 --> 00:55:27.920]  Like I said, I'm disabled, I can't do a whole lot, but I do everything that I can.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.721]  Jimmy, we gotta run, but great point.
[00:55:29.861 --> 00:55:32.822]  Let me just add, and we're gonna go to break and come back and try to hurry through calls a little bit faster.
[00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:34.162]  He just had a lot of interesting things to say.
[00:55:34.603 --> 00:55:36.563]  Matthew, David, Ahmed, Ryan, and others.
[00:55:37.023 --> 00:55:38.684]  And Bob Dacey's take on what's happening.
[00:55:38.704 --> 00:55:41.585]  We'll also plug his TV show and articles he writes before he leaves us.
[00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:42.505]  It's this.
[00:55:42.565 --> 00:55:44.106]  People say, what's the solution, Alex?
[00:55:44.426 --> 00:55:45.446]  We want a silver bullet.
[00:55:45.466 --> 00:55:47.107]  We want a magic thing.
[00:55:48.163 --> 00:55:50.985]  That we can do that will change everything overnight.
[00:55:51.565 --> 00:55:57.068]  Okay, look in the mirror and realize you're the solution to the problem and get up off your butt and don't imagine some perfect solution.
[00:55:57.208 --> 00:55:58.989]  Little things together move mountains.
[00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.510]  Many hands make light work.
[00:56:01.011 --> 00:56:02.672]  And the public is finally listening.
[00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:04.413]  They're finally realizing they've been lied to.
[00:56:04.913 --> 00:56:07.975]  And so now the people are more receptive to the truth than ever.
[00:56:08.675 --> 00:56:14.499]  And so a lot of you that woke people up 10, 20 years ago but quit because some folks weren't listening, redouble your efforts now.
[00:56:14.599 --> 00:56:16.921]  Get Terror Storm, Endgame, my films.
[00:56:16.961 --> 00:56:17.821]  Make copies of them.
[00:56:18.101 --> 00:56:22.404]  Every video and book order we have at InfoWars.com, you get a free pocket constitution.
[00:56:22.685 --> 00:56:23.985]  We have them at cost.
[00:56:24.386 --> 00:56:28.989]  The little pocket constitution is the Bill of Rights Constitution, famous quotes, Declaration of Independence.
[00:56:29.449 --> 00:56:31.691]  Powerful stuff in there for those that still read.
[00:56:32.052 --> 00:56:35.475]  But bottom line, the will to fight, the will to think, the will to resist.
[00:56:35.875 --> 00:56:37.317]  This enemy's very unpopular.
[00:56:37.337 --> 00:56:38.998]  If we just stand up, they will fall.
[00:56:39.058 --> 00:56:41.221]  If not, they're gonna win, and that's gonna be hell on earth.
[00:56:41.261 --> 00:56:41.781]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:42.962 --> 00:56:43.843]  We're on the march.
[00:56:44.344 --> 00:56:45.945]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:56:46.886 --> 00:56:49.549]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:53.115 --> 00:56:57.398]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:56:57.638 --> 00:57:02.541]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:57:02.741 --> 00:57:04.062]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[00:57:53.035 --> 00:57:59.423]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:57:59.783 --> 00:58:01.445]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:02.409 --> 00:58:03.429]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:04.490]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:05.770]  This is his M.O.
[00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:07.051]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:08.771]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:15.854]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:16.254 --> 00:58:16.694]  Some U.S.
[00:58:16.734 --> 00:58:22.416]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:23.096 --> 00:58:26.558]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:26.578 --> 00:58:28.579]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:58:58.246 --> 00:58:59.567]  Take a stand for health.

[00:59:15.437 --> 00:59:16.257]  Lose weight!
[00:59:16.878 --> 00:59:18.059]  You can do it!
[00:59:18.339 --> 00:59:19.640]  It's time for change.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.120]  It's time for health.
[00:59:21.341 --> 00:59:22.161]  Grab life.
[00:59:22.421 --> 00:59:23.382]  Turn from death.
[00:59:23.562 --> 00:59:25.964]  The chemicals in the air will only get worse.
[00:59:26.664 --> 00:59:27.044]  We're good.
[01:00:02.771 --> 01:00:12.338]  Bob, I just wanted to briefly get your take on taking action, going back just a few... What's going on?
[01:00:12.599 --> 01:00:14.900]  Well, no, I wanted to... Oh, you're pointing at something.
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.984]  No, I just wanted to expand on what the caller just said about knowing your Constitution and how important it is.
[01:00:20.485 --> 01:00:23.147]  Well, you know, if you don't know what your rights are, how can you defend them, right?
[01:00:23.207 --> 01:00:23.927]  That's basic.
[01:00:24.328 --> 01:00:27.550]  But here, a classic example... And the government can't say those rights are gone.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.692]  If it does that, it's criminal, it's engaged in terrorism.
[01:00:30.092 --> 01:00:33.293]  When people can see it, here's a classic example.
[01:00:33.553 --> 01:00:35.893]  People that don't like the Constitution are going to think I'm all wet.
[01:00:36.193 --> 01:00:48.456]  But if you go read Article 1, Section 7, for example, which most people don't know what that is, it says very plainly that when it comes to generating revenue, only the House of Representatives can generate a revenue bill.
[01:00:48.816 --> 01:00:49.416]  That's what it says.
[01:00:49.576 --> 01:00:50.856]  It's very simple to read.
[01:00:50.876 --> 01:00:53.397]  It says only the House of Representatives can generate a revenue bill.
[01:00:53.897 --> 01:00:57.220]  Now, the Senate can tack on to it, but the House has to generate it.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.701]  Well, what happened in the bailout?
[01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:00.001]  The House rejected it.
[01:01:00.342 --> 01:01:01.963]  There was nothing for the Senate to discuss.
[01:01:02.243 --> 01:01:02.703]  What'd they do?
[01:01:02.984 --> 01:01:04.305]  They take the bill over to the Senate.
[01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:06.266]  They load pork all over it.
[01:01:06.366 --> 01:01:10.429]  Another $150 billion worth of revenue generation stuff.
[01:01:11.192 --> 01:01:15.075]  And then they sent it back to the House, and then... And it was a bill that didn't pass the House!
[01:01:15.315 --> 01:01:16.156]  That didn't pass the House!
[01:01:16.236 --> 01:01:16.716]  It was illegal!
[01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:17.016]  Right!
[01:01:17.277 --> 01:01:18.578]  So the Senate... It was martial law!
[01:01:18.598 --> 01:01:22.581]  What I'm saying is, the Senate... Martial law is when the regular rules and laws are suspended.
[01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:24.942]  The Senate generated revenue bills.
[01:01:25.323 --> 01:01:29.286]  That's what the $150 billion worth of extra pork was, generated in the Senate.
[01:01:29.566 --> 01:01:33.068]  If you read the Constitution, you'll know that it's totally illegal!
[01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.109]  And that's what we're talking about.
[01:01:34.129 --> 01:01:36.351]  You need to know what your rights are in order to defend them.
[01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:37.512]  Okay, let me go back to my other question.
[01:01:37.772 --> 01:01:39.213]  I thought you were pointing at something across the room.
[01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:40.674]  You were, like, pointing over there, and I was like, what is it?
[01:01:41.014 --> 01:01:42.556]  Is there, like, a bug going up the wall or something?
[01:01:43.516 --> 01:01:44.057]  Solutions.
[01:01:45.296 --> 01:01:49.597]  If all of us individually get involved and do little things, i.e.
[01:01:49.617 --> 01:01:57.919]  the most important, you have to wake the public up first to the New World Order, then they can make real decisions and understand the real price to be paid and the enemy we're up against.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:09.062]  But if they still think the two parties matter and still believe any part of this paradigm, you know, the public now doesn't trust the media or trust the mainstream media or the government, but they don't have any idea just how bad it is.
[01:02:09.122 --> 01:02:14.304]  Bob, tell briefly, and then I want to go to Carl's, your story, how you woke up and what you've been able to do.
[01:02:14.904 --> 01:02:18.066]  Well, you know, what I've been able to do, gosh, you want me to brag on myself?
[01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:21.088]  Okay, Google Bob Dacey on the internet and you'll find out what I've been able to do.
[01:02:21.108 --> 01:02:23.289]  Let me see an example of one person waking up and taking action.
[01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:28.272]  Okay, you know, years ago, I was a conservative Republican type, and I was a good boy.
[01:02:28.472 --> 01:02:31.814]  I was a soccer coach and everything, state champions, the whole nine yards, you know.
[01:02:32.154 --> 01:02:33.595]  I was literally minding my own business.
[01:02:34.035 --> 01:02:36.137]  And I knew some was right, I just didn't know what it was.
[01:02:37.117 --> 01:02:37.497]  I don't think so.
[01:02:56.949 --> 01:02:57.890]  This guy's a nut!
[01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.471]  But I love his delivery style, so I'm going to listen to him.
[01:03:00.932 --> 01:03:05.995]  So I listened to him, and I thought, OK, this guy needs to be taken off to the money farm.
[01:03:06.355 --> 01:03:11.379]  And then he changed the subject, started talking about the Second Amendment, and I said, oh, I've got to hear this.
[01:03:11.639 --> 01:03:12.880]  I've got to hear this guy.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:24.287]  And so then this Alex Jones character started to succinctly, precisely, accurately, historically describe the purpose, the history of everything in the Second Amendment perfectly.
[01:03:24.587 --> 01:03:26.309]  And I was going, OK, wait a minute.
[01:03:27.409 --> 01:03:37.655]  This set up cognitive dissonance in my feeble brain, and I'm going, how could he be an idiot about this UN thing, taking over the National Parks, and be so 100% right on the Second Amendment?
[01:03:37.715 --> 01:03:47.721]  So I got off of my chair, went to my computer, and started researching what you, Alex Jones, said about the United Nations Biodiversity Treaty.
[01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:49.862]  You found out Congress had tried to block it?
[01:03:51.624 --> 01:03:51.864]  Right.
[01:03:51.984 --> 01:04:01.075]  I found out that the Kentucky State Legislature had passed a resolution the previous year explaining it, condemning it, saying that there was two of these areas in Kentucky that the U.N.
[01:04:01.095 --> 01:04:04.859]  was trying to take over, and they didn't want foreign minions in control of Kentucky land.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.346]  And this was a land, this was an earth-shattering event for me, because I was staring at my computer screen and I was saying,
[01:04:11.118 --> 01:04:13.899]  Everything that Nut told me about was right.
[01:04:14.119 --> 01:04:15.880]  And I'm mad because I didn't know about it.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.460]  I keep up.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.320]  I read the papers.
[01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:19.961]  I follow current events.
[01:04:20.201 --> 01:04:26.163]  And so this opened that little crack of light into my brain and then all of a sudden everything started to grow.
[01:04:26.443 --> 01:04:33.546]  And by the time I actually met you, it was so funny, your guy that ran your audio board for you at KJFK on Saturdays worked for me.
[01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:34.746]  Turned out.
[01:04:34.946 --> 01:04:36.507]  I was saying, who's this Alex Jones guy?
[01:04:36.527 --> 01:04:38.507]  KGFK was like 200 yards from your hardware store.
[01:04:38.547 --> 01:04:39.708]  Yeah, it's just right down the street.
[01:04:39.728 --> 01:04:41.968]  And I was like, do you know this Alex Jones guy?
[01:04:41.989 --> 01:04:42.729]  And he says, yeah.
[01:04:42.929 --> 01:04:43.689]  I said, why do you know him?
[01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:46.330]  Well, I run the audio board for his Saturday show on KGFK.
[01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:47.370]  I said, you've got to be kidding.
[01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:48.651]  And he said, no.
[01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:50.311]  I said, well, is that guy for real?
[01:04:50.711 --> 01:04:53.232]  And he said, well, he thinks he is.
[01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:54.732]  And so I said, bring him in here.
[01:04:54.752 --> 01:04:55.313]  I want to meet him.
[01:04:55.813 --> 01:04:59.594]  And so a few days later, he came in there with you in tow into my store.
[01:05:00.234 --> 01:05:01.395]  And we went back to my office.
[01:05:01.435 --> 01:05:03.297]  I was in there to sell you on a sponsorship.
[01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:06.159]  Yeah, I don't know what you were trying to do, but it didn't happen at that time.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.921]  We didn't even talk about a sponsorship.
[01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:19.051]  I'd been doing research myself at that time, and I found out that in my son's senior-level high school government book, they were teaching him that the Second Amendment doesn't exist, that it doesn't mean what it says.
[01:05:19.571 --> 01:05:23.095]  And I showed that to you, and you said, you might have to borrow this.
[01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:23.855]  You know?
[01:05:24.055 --> 01:05:25.116]  I said, here, go right ahead!
[01:05:25.977 --> 01:05:40.427]  And then, the next day, you were on the radio with it, reading it, and blasting it, and correcting it, and I was thinking... Now, it said, contrary to popular belief, the Second Amendment is only for an armed government militia of the National Guard and Army.
[01:05:40.467 --> 01:05:41.728]  No one is allowed to own guns.
[01:05:42.108 --> 01:05:45.030]  And then I went on air and pointed out, well, we didn't get the National Guard until 1906.
[01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:45.931]  Absolutely.
[01:05:47.432 --> 01:05:55.818]  My point is that when you did that, and I was listening to your radio show at the time, another little light came into my dense brain that said, media power.
[01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:58.040]  Wow, this is interesting.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:01.422]  I find out something, I give it to Alex Jones, boom!
[01:06:01.763 --> 01:06:02.723]  It goes all over the city.
[01:06:03.124 --> 01:06:05.926]  And now here it is ten years later, it's going all over the world.
[01:06:05.986 --> 01:06:08.888]  Well from, actually that station went from Dallas all the way to San Antonio.
[01:06:08.948 --> 01:06:11.570]  So it was, you know, I was like, hey this is pretty cool.
[01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:15.633]  So, you know, you and I have had this very good relationship over the last ten years.
[01:06:15.673 --> 01:06:16.714]  But then you went and got an access show.
[01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:26.282]  Yeah, the next year I stumbled into an Axis show, it's called The Simple Truth, and we just finished our ninth year and we're trying to get back on the air again for our tenth year.
[01:06:26.322 --> 01:06:29.125]  We're having paperwork problems, but we'll be back.
[01:06:29.825 --> 01:06:37.032]  Historically it's been six o'clock here on Channel 10, on Time Warner Cable, and we've also got a website now.
[01:06:37.052 --> 01:06:39.394]  And then you started writing for the New American, which we just mentioned.
[01:06:39.794 --> 01:06:51.003]  Yeah, I wrote a couple of articles for the New American, and my producer on my show, Kelly Taylor, she is the official writer for the New American on the Trans-Texas Corridor and After Superhighway issue.
[01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:55.486]  Several articles out, and so, you know, we've done all kinds of stuff.
[01:06:55.547 --> 01:06:58.189]  Last year, we were the ones that blew the cover off Texas.gov.
[01:06:59.089 --> 01:07:00.550]  scheme to toll the interstates.
[01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:01.450]  I mean, that was us!
[01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:07.172]  And again, we're now close to defeating that, because you took action to ferret it out.
[01:07:07.432 --> 01:07:08.512]  So there you go, folks.
[01:07:08.552 --> 01:07:11.393]  Pick your issue, fight the New World Order, you can take action.
[01:07:11.433 --> 01:07:14.014]  Let's go quick here.
[01:07:14.074 --> 01:07:14.674]  Who's up next?
[01:07:14.694 --> 01:07:15.595]  I've got to move fast now.
[01:07:15.655 --> 01:07:17.135]  Matthew in New York, you're on the air.
[01:07:18.696 --> 01:07:20.496]  I got a call from Costa Rica and I didn't go to it.
[01:07:20.756 --> 01:07:22.197]  Ryan, call back in, I'll go to you.
[01:07:22.477 --> 01:07:24.738]  Alex, hey, it's Matthew.
[01:07:24.978 --> 01:07:25.298]  Hey, buddy.
[01:07:25.358 --> 01:07:26.278]  Hey, Bob.
[01:07:26.598 --> 01:07:28.079]  I never would have guessed you were a
[01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:33.139]  Good old boy, you know, based upon your longhorn affinity, huh?
[01:07:33.159 --> 01:07:35.240]  Go masculine tribes.
[01:07:35.941 --> 01:07:39.123]  Look, when I was a kid, I grew up in the shadow of that tower, okay?
[01:07:39.443 --> 01:07:41.384]  I lived and breathed UT football.
[01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:43.085]  That's all I cared about when I was a kid.
[01:07:43.846 --> 01:07:45.306]  That tribal thing gets in you.
[01:07:45.507 --> 01:07:50.770]  When I went to UT, I went there for four years, and when I was there, we never beat those sorry, okie sons of a guns.
[01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:57.594]  And so, you get it in your system, and then all of a sudden, when the game is on, that tribal thing comes back.
[01:07:57.914 --> 01:07:59.475]  And all of a sudden, I hate the Okies.
[01:07:59.755 --> 01:08:00.596]  Just for a little while.
[01:08:00.896 --> 01:08:01.596]  Just for a little while.
[01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:04.458]  Alright, well let's cut off the tribal brainwashing here.
[01:08:04.638 --> 01:08:05.118]  It's okay.
[01:08:05.899 --> 01:08:06.559]  It's okay.
[01:08:06.579 --> 01:08:06.599]  45-35.
[01:08:06.699 --> 01:08:07.960]  Let me ask you a quick question here.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.701]  You know, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[01:08:10.241 --> 01:08:14.684]  I get all the information from the white papers and the primary source material, just like you do.
[01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.865]  And that's why I appreciate it, because you don't go off on the tangents.
[01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:26.121]  You know, you try and wake people up with 9-11 just by focusing on World Trade Center 7, the economy, just what the, you know, the Constitution specifically states who can print money, etc.
[01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:30.424]  And, you know, it's funny, because my call was all about, you know, where is the solution?
[01:08:30.445 --> 01:08:31.966]  You know, where are we going to find the solution?
[01:08:32.006 --> 01:08:45.477]  Well, in my opinion, it's too late, because a lot of people I know are waking up, you know, either through your videos or just through me giving them the primary source materials or their white papers, and they realize that, hey, you know, we're being shafted here.
[01:08:46.336 --> 01:08:53.299]  And, you know, like you stated before, you know, the governors are on the payroll, the state legislatures are on the payroll, the local people are on the payroll.
[01:08:53.886 --> 01:08:57.489]  And it's getting to a point now where, you know, what else is there left for us to do?
[01:08:57.509 --> 01:09:02.072]  I mean, how much more information do we need to find out about that they're completely shafting us?
[01:09:02.092 --> 01:09:03.433]  Well, you know all about it!
[01:09:03.493 --> 01:09:09.838]  Hold on, you know all about it, but the general public still doesn't know all of it, or even a lot of it, or even a little bit of it.
[01:09:10.118 --> 01:09:13.761]  They know they're being lied to, they know there's a tyranny, but they don't have the details.
[01:09:14.342 --> 01:09:19.666]  And so, it's up to you to carry the ball, to use a football analogy, and to get out there and wake them up, sir.
[01:09:19.726 --> 01:09:21.327]  I mean, if it isn't going to be you, it's going to be nobody.
[01:09:22.264 --> 01:09:25.085]  No, and I understand that, Mr. Jones, but my concern is as follows.
[01:09:25.105 --> 01:09:26.906]  I mean, they've already done the damage they need to do.
[01:09:26.926 --> 01:09:33.290]  I mean, here you have a private banking consortium that is basically raping insolvent companies.
[01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:39.593]  You have people that are in power that are keeping other people on a low conscious brainwave state.
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:44.622]  So, even though you're waking people up, you know, bit by bit, you know, we know the damage is done.
[01:09:44.762 --> 01:09:49.444]  And we've gone through the regular process of stating... Hey, listen... No, we... Hold on.
[01:09:49.464 --> 01:09:51.525]  We tell them that cell phones are frying their brains.
[01:09:51.565 --> 01:09:52.545]  Quit using them as much.
[01:09:52.845 --> 01:09:58.568]  We explain that TV, with the flicker rate and the different images and the subliminals, is mesmerizing them.
[01:09:58.588 --> 01:10:02.310]  That's mainline science, that you go into a dream state, a waking dream state.
[01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:04.430]  You educate them about that.
[01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:07.792]  I mean, look, things are bad, but all we can do is fight back against it.
[01:10:08.152 --> 01:10:10.515]  I guarantee you if we weren't fighting back against it, it would be a lot worse.
[01:10:11.216 --> 01:10:12.217]  No, I agree with you 100%.
[01:10:12.357 --> 01:10:12.978]  Here's an example.
[01:10:12.998 --> 01:10:18.105]  They already meant by this year to have, what, nine major Austin roads in the city be toll roads.
[01:10:18.425 --> 01:10:20.508]  They've only got like one and a couple outside.
[01:10:20.528 --> 01:10:22.270]  I mean, we've held back 90% of their crap.
[01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:24.313]  That's one microcosm example.
[01:10:25.691 --> 01:10:26.652]  You've got the North American Union, right?
[01:10:26.672 --> 01:10:27.833]  You've got the North American Union.
[01:10:27.873 --> 01:10:31.776]  Their deal was to have it done by the end of 2005.
[01:10:31.896 --> 01:10:32.517]  Guess what?
[01:10:33.057 --> 01:10:33.958]  We screwed them up.
[01:10:34.378 --> 01:10:35.979]  We're making a difference.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.163]  Everywhere it's falling apart, but I mean, I know... What are you saying?
[01:10:40.683 --> 01:10:43.386]  I'm trying to get a... What I'm saying is, I mean, the writing on the wall is already there.
[01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:48.530]  I mean, just the last month and a half of just the events that's going on, just with the Federal Reserve, for instance.
[01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:53.254]  Yeah, but as the tyranny unfolds here,
[01:10:55.598 --> 01:10:56.799]  Bob, you've got a cough button right there.
[01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:57.319]  Let me show you.
[01:10:57.339 --> 01:10:58.240]  You just hit that when you need to cough.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:58.840]  It won't be as long.
[01:11:00.461 --> 01:11:02.863]  As the journey unfolds, everything we said is coming true.
[01:11:03.183 --> 01:11:04.324]  Our credibility goes up.
[01:11:04.404 --> 01:11:05.244]  It's a fight, sir.
[01:11:05.545 --> 01:11:06.785]  And look, I appreciate your call.
[01:11:06.825 --> 01:11:11.188]  I know stuff's bad, but I need to get to all the calls and I just can't sit here and put out gloom and doom.
[01:11:11.589 --> 01:11:12.989]  I mean, people think I gloom and doom.
[01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:17.332]  I'm just breaking down what the enemy plans to do and all I know is we have to fight it.
[01:11:18.213 --> 01:11:20.915]  Now, let's go ahead and play that Lou Dobbs clip.
[01:11:20.935 --> 01:11:23.737]  It's only about a minute and a half long of them talking about the North American Union.
[01:11:23.777 --> 01:11:24.077]  Here it is.
[01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:28.273]  The fight against the North American Union is escalating.
[01:11:30.015 --> 01:11:32.198]  What happened on that clip?
[01:11:33.772 --> 01:11:39.297]  The fight against the North American Union is escalating, not at the federal level, but at the state level.
[01:11:39.597 --> 01:11:47.304]  Currently, 14 states are considering legislation opposing what the administration calls the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:54.010]  In Idaho, the measure has been approved by both houses of its legislature because Idaho is tired of the secrecy.
[01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:58.734]  In a simple statement from one of the Senate sponsors, he explains, quote,
[01:11:59.346 --> 01:11:59.626]  I don't
[01:12:18.872 --> 01:12:27.160]  The Senate inserted language praising the North American Union for progress made, quote, In other words, gone are the borders of the United States of America,
[01:12:38.288 --> 01:12:40.710]  Welcome to the borders of North America.
[01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:43.911]  It's a far cry from what's happening at the state level.
[01:12:44.332 --> 01:12:48.754]  The state activity is an indication of the grassroots concern about this issue.
[01:12:49.155 --> 01:12:59.561]  The states are closer to the grassroots, and that's where you're going to first see the indication of some discomfort with the Security Prosperity Partnership, or the idea of a North American Union.
[01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:05.645]  Washington isn't listening, just as Washington has ignored the people on the issue of immigration.
[01:13:06.145 --> 01:13:07.786]  Bill Tucker, CNN, New York.
[01:13:08.658 --> 01:13:12.539]  Okay, so I want your comment on this briefly, Bob, and I want to get to all these calls.
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:16.641]  David and Ahmed and Scott and Aaron and everybody else.
[01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:17.901]  And Ryan's back from Costa Rica.
[01:13:17.921 --> 01:13:18.981]  We'll go to him first, actually.
[01:13:19.462 --> 01:13:22.803]  Actually, I've had a few calls from Costa Rica.
[01:13:22.823 --> 01:13:24.543]  I have a map on the wall of all the calls.
[01:13:24.583 --> 01:13:27.484]  I've got McMurtle Weather Station, Antarctica, places like that.
[01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:29.125]  You listen to that.
[01:13:29.665 --> 01:13:31.647]  The Feds come in, they sign all the documents.
[01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:33.068]  We're going into the North American Union.
[01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.749]  There are lawsuits for four-year documents.
[01:13:34.769 --> 01:13:35.790]  Judicial Watch gets them.
[01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.151]  It's all happening.
[01:13:37.931 --> 01:13:39.632]  The public documents say NAU.
[01:13:39.973 --> 01:13:42.455]  And the Feds keep denying it and saying it doesn't exist.
[01:13:42.815 --> 01:13:44.976]  And the states are waking up and saying, look, you're liars.
[01:13:45.297 --> 01:13:46.357]  It's coming into our states.
[01:13:46.397 --> 01:13:47.178]  We're saying no.
[01:13:47.638 --> 01:13:54.664]  So see, once the government's exposed as being illegitimate, and a pack of criminals bought and paid for by foreign banks, they lose all legitimacy.
[01:13:55.004 --> 01:13:56.285]  They're now illegitimate.
[01:13:58.226 --> 01:14:01.209]  And they lose public support and acquiescence.
[01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:06.133]  And they can only go so far with the tyranny when the people and the system start saying no.
[01:14:06.653 --> 01:14:12.338]  The word has to get out that crooks are running things and they're only going to make things worse because they're totally ruthless.
[01:14:12.638 --> 01:14:13.479]  We are winning.
[01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:15.501]  The North American Union is exposed.
[01:14:15.741 --> 01:14:18.624]  The people that were told it didn't exist now know the media lied.
[01:14:19.184 --> 01:14:28.068]  Okay, I mean, when CNN and Fox came out and said the Trans-Texas Corridor didn't exist, as billboards were going up in Texas as the governor was announcing it, that woke everybody up in Texas right there!
[01:14:28.568 --> 01:14:30.649]  This level of lying is going to backfire.
[01:14:30.689 --> 01:14:31.049]  Bob Dasey.
[01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:44.956]  And, you know, another example of that, last year when The Nation magazine came out with that big front page article that said that the North, you know, that the Trans-Texas Corridor was real, but the Napa Superhighway was something that we nutty conspiracy theorists just made up,
[01:14:45.496 --> 01:14:49.962]  When they went out public with that thing, we counter-attacked them immediately.
[01:14:49.982 --> 01:14:52.465]  Heck, I was doing your show when that happened.
[01:14:52.725 --> 01:15:01.436]  And what happened, when the guy that wrote the article was on the Washington Journal, every call he got was blasting him because they were calling him a liar.
[01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:01.896]  Yeah, it was over 90%.
[01:15:02.657 --> 01:15:03.818]  Yeah, it was ridiculous.
[01:15:04.358 --> 01:15:08.000]  He was sitting there trying to defend his ridiculous article for which there was no defense.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.080]  We are winning this.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:11.261]  Folks, we are winning the hearts and minds.
[01:15:11.581 --> 01:15:13.102]  We need to have a winner's attitude.
[01:15:13.362 --> 01:15:15.783]  It's a tough road to go up, but it's the only road we've got.
[01:15:15.823 --> 01:15:17.164]  We've got to kick butt here, folks.
[01:15:17.844 --> 01:15:19.465]  Let's go to Ryan in Costa Rica.
[01:15:19.545 --> 01:15:20.406]  You're on the air, Ryan.
[01:15:21.646 --> 01:15:23.427]  Alex, it's an honor to be on.
[01:15:23.447 --> 01:15:24.728]  I've been listening for years.
[01:15:25.968 --> 01:15:29.470]  These times right now, I figured I had to call in and talk to you.
[01:15:30.587 --> 01:15:33.109]  I won't even bother asking you how you're doing right now.
[01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:38.552]  I know the United States is under complete attack and I can't even sleep right now.
[01:15:38.612 --> 01:15:47.258]  I'm just paying such close attention, listening to all four hours of your show every single day, doing all the research and just trying to find solutions like you're saying.
[01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:49.104]  I think so.
[01:16:03.516 --> 01:16:07.617]  Finding that people are so open to the information right now, it's like, this is the time.
[01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:19.961]  Exactly, and so many people in the reality movement, the awakening movement, the liberty movement, the history movement, people that study history, a lot of us have bad attitudes, nobody cares, nothing we can do, it's all over.
[01:16:20.321 --> 01:16:25.663]  Meanwhile, it's the greatest awakening ever, we need to maximize everything right now.
[01:16:25.923 --> 01:16:29.164]  The internet may not be here soon in its current form, they're openly trying to get rid of it.
[01:16:29.464 --> 01:16:31.805]  We need to use it while we've got it.
[01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:40.782]  And watching Riddles in Stone last night and just realizing that these people have a true plan for what they're trying to do to us.
[01:16:40.842 --> 01:16:43.723]  And they are working 24 hours a day against us.
[01:16:44.223 --> 01:16:50.304]  We gotta wake up and work 24 hours a day against them and send out mass emails to everybody.
[01:16:50.464 --> 01:16:52.405]  Everyone needs to watch the free videos.
[01:16:53.365 --> 01:16:59.926]  I've got one I spent 6 hours making last night just to make it really nice and beautiful that people will look at and hopefully click.
[01:17:00.419 --> 01:17:12.613]  On articles where mainstream media is saying that Paulson is a dictator, that we're giving over all of our power to the banks, and that the Federal Reserve is private, people are finally realizing it in mainstream America.
[01:17:13.033 --> 01:17:21.623]  By the way, we ended up getting that video clip from last week, a caller called in with the audio, where they call in one of the heads of the World Bank and say the Federal Reserve is private, and the guy goes, no it's not, it's federal.
[01:17:23.962 --> 01:17:26.203]  Alright, listen, I appreciate your call from Costa Rica.
[01:17:26.223 --> 01:17:26.843]  We're out of time.
[01:17:27.163 --> 01:17:28.144]  Final segment coming up.
[01:17:28.184 --> 01:17:36.247]  I'm going to skip for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and the listeners at InfoWars.com on those streams.
[01:17:36.267 --> 01:17:37.547]  I'm going to skip this break.
[01:17:38.308 --> 01:17:43.049]  But for everybody else, I forgot the big announcement that I forgot to do last hour.
[01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.070]  Big announcement when we come back just briefly.
[01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:48.291]  Big announcement about a Wednesday guest for two hours.
[01:17:48.712 --> 01:17:51.673]  This is going to make for some really informative and compelling radio.
[01:17:53.226 --> 01:17:55.589]  Okay, Bob, continue with the calls here.
[01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:57.631]  Who's up next here, John, in order?
[01:17:58.592 --> 01:17:59.593]  Ahmed in New York.
[01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:01.675]  Ahmed in New York, you're on the air, sir.
[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.382]  Go ahead, Ahmed, you're on the air.
[01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:09.845]  How's it going, Mr. Jones?
[01:18:09.905 --> 01:18:11.526]  Mr. Dacey, it's an honor to be on the show.
[01:18:11.546 --> 01:18:12.807]  It's an honor to talk to you, Ahmed.
[01:18:12.827 --> 01:18:13.547]  What's on your cookbook?
[01:18:13.567 --> 01:18:15.369]  Go ahead.
[01:18:15.409 --> 01:18:18.371]  I'm here from New York, and I basically have a two-part question.
[01:18:18.411 --> 01:18:25.536]  The first part being, obviously, what is some advice on how we can warn people living in major cities like New York City?
[01:18:25.596 --> 01:18:30.139]  Obviously, the movement is strong, and the word of truth is getting out there.
[01:18:30.179 --> 01:18:31.780]  So as far as major cities,
[01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:39.460]  Um, you know, besides the idea of buying food and hoarding those type of things, what type of things should we expect to see?
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:39.800]  Right, right.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:40.841]  Well, I'm in Brooklyn, yeah.
[01:19:03.587 --> 01:19:06.629]  Well, that's not as bad, because at least you're tied into the mainland there.
[01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:10.311]  You know, just wake up your friends, family, and neighbors.
[01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:12.832]  That way the public won't spy, won't tattle.
[01:19:12.912 --> 01:19:13.572]  We're together.
[01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:17.234]  They're going to say you're going to get food and shelter if you tattle on people.
[01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:18.275]  The feds are already saying that.
[01:19:18.575 --> 01:19:21.076]  Same stuff that the Nazis and the Communists did.
[01:19:21.476 --> 01:19:22.677]  I mean, it's hellish.
[01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:23.537]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:19:23.557 --> 01:19:29.180]  They plan to bring us into full depression, full martial law, to squeeze us and teach us to love them.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.361]  Where you know, oh, save me government!
[01:19:31.381 --> 01:19:33.661]  They want to social engineer everybody.
[01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:38.142]  I would say also, stay away from big crowds and don't throw rocks at banks.
[01:19:38.823 --> 01:19:39.183]  Good idea.
[01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:43.724]  Yeah, like the hired anarchists do.
[01:19:43.744 --> 01:19:44.464]  Not all anarchists.
[01:19:44.484 --> 01:19:46.925]  The hired ones do, so they have a pretext to attack peaceful crowds.
[01:19:46.985 --> 01:19:48.065]  Just don't do anything stupid.
[01:19:48.405 --> 01:19:50.026]  Don't give them an excuse.
[01:19:50.566 --> 01:19:51.426]  Stay away from crowds.
[01:19:52.813 --> 01:19:53.973]  Unless you're out trying to wake people up.
[01:19:54.114 --> 01:19:56.394]  Well, I'm talking about, you know, the violent crowds, you know.
[01:19:56.474 --> 01:19:57.475]  Talking about during martial law.
[01:19:57.635 --> 01:20:01.476]  Yeah, don't be doing that, because then you're going to be a sound cannon fodder.
[01:20:02.877 --> 01:20:09.100]  What's going to happen is they're going to turn these sound cannons on, and somebody's going to end up pulling out a rifle, and that sound cannon's going to go down real fast.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:15.002]  And then the war starts, and I don't want that, Bob, but I think you're going to end up, I think hell's going to blow up.
[01:20:15.589 --> 01:20:21.074]  And a whole bunch of civil disobedience on the part of the police and on the part of the military.
[01:20:21.554 --> 01:20:23.876]  Just kind of go through the motions and don't do what they tell you.
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.780]  Because that's patriotism.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:26.900]  You think that's going to happen?
[01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.241]  I think it's going to happen.
[01:20:28.481 --> 01:20:41.723]  A lot of the police, a lot of the military are going to say, I'm not going to participate in this garbage, because I got kids, I got grandkids, and I want a future for America, and I think a lot of the police are just going to go through the motions and say, uh-uh, we're not participating.
[01:20:41.783 --> 01:20:44.123]  All right, I got to jump, I appreciate your call.
[01:20:44.523 --> 01:20:50.364]  We're going to come back and talk to Scott, Aaron, and Dick, and that's going to be it in the final segment here.
[01:20:51.865 --> 01:20:52.945]  Here we go, back to the full audience.
[01:20:58.419 --> 01:21:03.203]  Okay, remember, I haven't even plugged my videos this whole show, other than saying, get them, make copies of them.
[01:21:03.383 --> 01:21:05.104]  They're the best films out there, in my opinion.
[01:21:05.164 --> 01:21:06.505]  Terror Storm, I think, is the best film.
[01:21:06.865 --> 01:21:09.727]  All government-sponsored terrorism, and exactly who we're dealing with.
[01:21:10.268 --> 01:21:17.613]  Some of the other sponsors that make this show possible, efoodsdirect.com, big banners at the top of infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:21:17.994 --> 01:21:24.018]  It is the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation, and
[01:21:25.299 --> 01:21:30.523]  They're just great folks, and so we really hope that everybody will check out efoodsdirect.com.
[01:21:30.783 --> 01:21:37.709]  Get a free brochure, free audio CD about the great storable foods that they have, high quality, with all the uncertainty that we're living under.
[01:21:38.049 --> 01:21:42.652]  It is more important than ever to be self-sufficient, and that's my message for people going into these trying times.
[01:21:42.913 --> 01:21:45.815]  Have food, have firearms, don't go out offensively looking for trouble.
[01:21:46.155 --> 01:21:47.135]  But protect yourself.
[01:21:47.155 --> 01:21:52.857]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:21:52.877 --> 01:22:02.160]  And then lastly, a cola blue are these great atmospheric water generators that just grab the water out of the air, sends it through five different filters.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:06.601]  We have links up on Infowars.com to Ecolablue.com.
[01:22:06.641 --> 01:22:10.123]  It's spelled E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:22:10.563 --> 01:22:16.265]  Ecolablue.com or give them a call at 866-585-4044.
[01:22:16.285 --> 01:22:16.545]  866-585-4044.
[01:22:16.985 --> 01:22:18.185]  Atmospheric water generator.
[01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:19.826]  Seven and a half gallons a day.
[01:22:19.906 --> 01:22:21.226]  Five different filters it goes through.
[01:22:21.246 --> 01:22:24.808]  Ecolablue.com banner on Infowars.com.
[01:22:25.368 --> 01:22:26.448]  Let's jam in here.
[01:22:26.488 --> 01:22:28.069]  I guess Scott in Arizona is up next.
[01:22:29.409 --> 01:22:30.270]  Hey Alex, how are you buddy?
[01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:31.130]  Good sir, go ahead.
[01:22:32.742 --> 01:22:38.298]  I didn't get to catch all your show today, but how long do you think... I know they've got the points at 700 or the plus right now.
[01:22:39.386 --> 01:22:42.087]  How long do you think that will last before it drops back down again?
[01:22:42.167 --> 01:22:47.428]  I think it will last two weeks, maybe a month, and then it's going to start plunging again.
[01:22:47.448 --> 01:22:54.991]  They'll say we need even more power, more infusions, more nationalization, more imperial power for the banks.
[01:22:55.451 --> 01:22:56.631]  But that's not what's going to matter.
[01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:58.952]  People are obsessing on their pension funds.
[01:22:59.612 --> 01:23:02.593]  When they cash it out, it won't matter because it's going to be in devalued dollars.
[01:23:02.993 --> 01:23:08.475]  So it's the hyperinflation that's going to kill us, and that's already here, but it's going to intensify in the next 24 months.
[01:23:09.335 --> 01:23:10.936]  I mean, it's going to be just unbelievable.
[01:23:13.618 --> 01:23:14.138]  That's what I thought.
[01:23:14.178 --> 01:23:14.638]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:23:14.818 --> 01:23:16.079]  Thank you, I appreciate that.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:20.142]  Now let's go ahead and go to another caller.
[01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:23.244]  Let's talk to Aaron in Idaho.
[01:23:23.684 --> 01:23:24.945]  Aaron in Idaho, you're on the air.
[01:23:25.745 --> 01:23:26.966]  Alex, it's great to hear from you.
[01:23:27.046 --> 01:23:28.487]  I love your show, number one.
[01:23:28.507 --> 01:23:30.468]  The timing couldn't be better for my call.
[01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:34.991]  I'm all about solutions versus problems, and I believe that
[01:23:35.461 --> 01:23:40.405]  What we need to focus on here is everything you're presenting is the orientation of consciousness on the solutions.
[01:23:40.445 --> 01:23:41.366]  Well, what's the solution?
[01:23:41.386 --> 01:23:42.507]  The solution is unity.
[01:23:43.027 --> 01:23:44.789]  Getting everybody together on the same page.
[01:23:45.589 --> 01:23:53.996]  Now, I think that we have reached a sort of a critical mass of people because I know that everybody I talk to out there has some sort of an inclination or feeling that something's not right.
[01:23:54.056 --> 01:23:55.137]  They know something's amiss.
[01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.118]  It's not just America, it's all over the world.
[01:23:57.999 --> 01:24:00.261]  So, my, you know, what my thought is is that
[01:24:00.785 --> 01:24:14.394]  What we've got to do is just focus our consciousness on the solution, which is coming together, and just hanging up our problem hats for a little bit until it's elections over anyways, and get together, get everybody out there to vote for a third-party candidate.
[01:24:14.414 --> 01:24:15.995]  I don't care if it screws up the election.
[01:24:16.415 --> 01:24:25.741]  The bottom line here is it's a show of numbers, and when people across the world see that the United States have come together in this big of numbers, they're going to jump on the bandwagon.
[01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:26.942]  They're going to wake up even more.
[01:24:28.928 --> 01:24:30.111]  I appreciate your call.
[01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:38.151]  We've got to be careful not to get into too much new agey stuff, because look at India, where they think positive, but everybody's basically sitting out in piles of crap on the side of the road.
[01:24:39.266 --> 01:24:43.208]  Well, you know, all you Christians out there, I think it would help to pray, too.
[01:24:43.388 --> 01:24:44.669]  Well, and that's what he means.
[01:24:44.769 --> 01:24:48.671]  I mean, focusing on good, thinking of ideas, coming together.
[01:24:48.771 --> 01:24:52.413]  I agree with you, sir, but we also need to put those ideas into action.
[01:24:53.133 --> 01:24:56.255]  I'm sorry to Dick and a couple other callers.
[01:24:56.295 --> 01:24:58.656]  Call me back tomorrow, and you'll go to the head of the line.
[01:24:58.676 --> 01:24:59.616]  Bob Daisy, thanks for coming in.
[01:24:59.656 --> 01:25:00.477]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:25:00.517 --> 01:25:01.137]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:01.177 --> 01:25:01.878]  Keep up the good work.
[01:25:01.918 --> 01:25:02.698]  Give out your website.
[01:25:02.978 --> 01:25:04.819]  SimpleTruthOnline.net.
[01:25:04.879 --> 01:25:06.299]  SimpleTruthOnline.net.
[01:25:06.419 --> 01:25:06.700]  Go there.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.660]  SimpleTruthOnline.net.
[01:25:09.141 --> 01:25:12.502]  And if you live in Austin, Texas, you can see reruns of his show in the live show.
[01:25:12.522 --> 01:25:17.764]  You can check the TV Guide and other information, and it's there once a week.
[01:25:18.404 --> 01:25:18.664]  All right.
[01:25:18.724 --> 01:25:24.947]  Rebroadcast with the economic historian William Engdahl and others right at the start of the show.
[01:25:24.967 --> 01:25:26.668]  It was a really powerful broadcast today.
[01:25:26.968 --> 01:25:31.150]  Hope you'll join us in the rebroadcast only on the Internet at InfoWars.com and stations across the country.
[01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:31.930]  God bless you.
[01:25:33.518 --> 01:25:34.828]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
