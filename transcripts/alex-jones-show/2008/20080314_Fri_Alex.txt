[00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:10.137]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:11.598]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:13.279]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.602]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.102 --> 00:00:22.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:33.312]  What a day!
[00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:34.072]  What a broadcast!
[00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:37.615]  What a Friday we have lined up for you on this 14th day of March 2008.
[00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:39.196]  Gold has blasted past $1,010 an ounce.
[00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:02.309]  Gold has blasted past $1,010 an ounce.
[00:01:06.492 --> 00:01:09.814]  The economy is in full meltdown publicly.
[00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:28.108]  The stock market is going up and down crazily right now as the central banks pump tens of billions of dollars an hour into the plunge protection team as they try to keep at least that imaginary benchmark of wealth up.
[00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:38.550]  If it plunges, if it continues to plunge, the yuppies will panic, and who knows what they'll call for.
[00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.091]  Adolf Hitler, probably.
[00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:51.255]  Just give us, give us yuppie power, we'll give you, you know, we just put everybody in camps, FEMA camps, we'll do whatever you say, Heil Hitler, kill all the Muslims.
[00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:54.456]  You know, that's the problem.
[00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:59.398]  We go into a really serious depression in this country, and the general public are going to turn into animals.
[00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:02.258]  Animals.
[00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:09.885]  Alright, here is the financial news.
[00:02:09.965 --> 00:02:13.027]  Dollar drops on trouble at Bear Stearns.
[00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:16.450]  Okay, the dollar plunged to 1.56.
[00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:21.414]  It takes $1.56 to buy one euro.
[00:02:21.735 --> 00:02:24.677]  Remember, the euro opened at 82 cents to the dollar in 2000.
[00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:30.602]  So, 56 and 18, add that together, and that's the loss in the dollar against the euro.
[00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:40.243]  Or you can do the comparison at parity for about 2002 when the euro reached parity with the dollar.
[00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:45.224]  Dollar drops on trouble at Bear Stearns.
[00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:49.285]  So they put in hundreds of billions of dollars in the last four days.
[00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:56.287]  The federal government said we will put in no matter how much money it takes to bail out the banks
[00:02:57.512 --> 00:02:59.073]  Who, by the way, got real assets.
[00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:02.556]  They handed us the paper, the investors, but they got real assets.
[00:03:03.637 --> 00:03:05.739]  We're just going to print money until the cows come home.
[00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.941]  And the world said, that's it, dump the dollar.
[00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:12.865]  Of course, you've got them cutting interest rates on top of it.
[00:03:12.885 --> 00:03:14.266]  That makes the world dump the dollar.
[00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:20.431]  But if that wasn't enough, you've got Greenspan and the rest of them running around, bad-mouthing the dollar to foreign audiences.
[00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:48.981]  So they have just fired every torpedo they've got into the dollar while they run around on domestic television posing as our saviors and the yuppies get sly looks in their eyes and think they've gotten some great kernel of info watching CNBC and go back to the golf course thinking all was fine while the Titanic begins listing at a 45 degree angle preparing to break in two.
[00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.491]  Dollar drops on trouble at Bear Stearns.
[00:03:54.631 --> 00:04:00.835]  Home prices plunge across the nation, but nowhere as strongly as they've now plunged.
[00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:03.957]  In California, we just got last month's numbers in.
[00:04:04.258 --> 00:04:05.658]  Gee, it's just going to compound.
[00:04:05.698 --> 00:04:07.820]  The bad news racing in.
[00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:17.405]  Meanwhile, Rush Limbaugh and others have had a talking point the last six months saying it's a liberal lie that the economy's not doing well.
[00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:19.146]  It has nothing to do with the liberals.
[00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:22.128]  The liberals are owned by the same private Federal Reserve.
[00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:24.189]  They're for the exact same policies.
[00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.072]  But it becomes a tempest in a teapot to debate about that.
[00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:33.513]  Or I've seen many news reports saying Al-Qaeda caused this.
[00:04:33.553 --> 00:04:34.413]  Yes, it's them!
[00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:36.374]  Not the central bankers.
[00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:37.895]  The New World Order.
[00:04:37.995 --> 00:04:38.675]  Not NAFTA.
[00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:39.336]  Not GATT.
[00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:41.457]  No, no, no.
[00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:43.078]  Not any of it.
[00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:48.340]  Crude oil rises to record $111 in New York on week U.S.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.721]  dollar.
[00:04:54.136 --> 00:04:56.217]  We'll cover it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:57.938]  It's Fiscal Armageddon!
[00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:03.382]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:05.503]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.203 --> 00:05:10.706]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:11.106 --> 00:05:13.908]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:16.169]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.131]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:27.255]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:35.184]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.704 --> 00:05:39.167]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:42.069]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.269]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.030]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.131]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:46.191]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:47.372]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:55.678]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:55.798 --> 00:05:56.718]  Endgame.
[00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.080]  Only prepped for global enslavement.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.141]  You have been warned.
[00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.840]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.102]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:06:06.342 --> 00:06:10.965]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:06:11.305 --> 00:06:13.927]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:06:14.207 --> 00:06:19.070]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.051]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:26.995]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:28.976]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.637]  SFR works so well
[00:06:30.657 --> 00:06:33.239]  Well, that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:44.688]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:50.152]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[00:06:50.372 --> 00:06:53.414]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:06:53.654 --> 00:06:54.095]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[00:06:54.135 --> 00:06:55.856]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:02.073]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:07:02.414 --> 00:07:07.918]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:16.345]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:20.469]  The package contains 6 DVDs that contain 10 different programs.
[00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:21.090]  I think so.
[00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:45.033]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:48.574]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:07:48.614 --> 00:07:49.815]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:08:02.777 --> 00:08:08.801]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:12.464]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:14.846]  In gold futures, gold is above $1,010.
[00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:16.947]  It went up to $1,010, settled back down to about $1,005.
[00:08:16.987 --> 00:08:19.349]  A new ceiling, it has broken through that ceiling.
[00:08:31.494 --> 00:08:33.515]  That major psychological barrier.
[00:08:34.715 --> 00:08:42.118]  Now remember, just a few days ago we played the White House Press Secretary saying she'll be fired if she talks about the strength of the dollar.
[00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:51.522]  And the reporters are saying, but the White House, can you please tell us, White House, is it true that oil costs more because of a devalued dollar?
[00:08:52.123 --> 00:08:55.164]  We need to know if this is true or if this is a lie.
[00:08:56.175 --> 00:09:04.857]  Like you need to go to the White House to ask them if a devalued dollar is the main causal reason.
[00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:06.638]  The main reason.
[00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:13.320]  I mean, we're talking 90 plus percent of the reason that the oil costs so much.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.480]  Well, of course that's why.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.681]  The dollar is being devalued.
[00:09:19.278 --> 00:09:21.118]  The bankers got full control of us.
[00:09:21.178 --> 00:09:22.079]  They bankrupted us.
[00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:23.259]  They got us all in debt.
[00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:24.539]  The state's in debt.
[00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:26.559]  They set up a huge government.
[00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.060]  They're only now trying to double it again.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.280]  Bush more than doubled it.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.861]  Just to run every facet of our lives.
[00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:35.801]  Because it was all fiat.
[00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.842]  They were issuing it out of nothing, but we have to pay the bill.
[00:09:39.962 --> 00:09:41.822]  They get to buy the world with it.
[00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:43.343]  They get the assets.
[00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:44.883]  We're left holding the bag.
[00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:49.658]  They did everything they could from tax incentives to move offshore.
[00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:51.260]  That's globalism.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.603]  To de-industrialize the West, to bring the U.S.
[00:09:54.663 --> 00:10:05.533]  down, to destroy the middle class so that they can micromanage and control our daily lives, so we don't have money to defend ourselves, money to raise our own children, money to private school or home school.
[00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:08.936]  This is all in government documents from a hundred years ago.
[00:10:09.036 --> 00:10:09.997]  They put it into place.
[00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:11.018]  They've done it.
[00:10:13.354 --> 00:10:14.315]  This is feudalism.
[00:10:14.356 --> 00:10:15.117]  This is serfdom.
[00:10:15.137 --> 00:10:19.502]  This is a long-term strategic plan now coming to a head.
[00:10:19.543 --> 00:10:22.286]  And what are they saying the answer to the fiscal crisis is?
[00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:24.089]  More credit.
[00:10:24.169 --> 00:10:25.130]  More credit cards.
[00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.131]  More mortgages.
[00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:26.852]  More money.
[00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:29.236]  But that devalues the currency.
[00:10:29.376 --> 00:10:30.838]  Again, the globalist
[00:10:31.463 --> 00:10:34.004]  Flooded the globe with dollars.
[00:10:34.584 --> 00:10:50.208]  They bought up dams, power plants, water plants, gold mines, nickel mines, cadmium mines, bauxite mines, timber, forest, farms, big agri companies, finance, armaments companies, media companies.
[00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:52.289]  They bought up everything.
[00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.671]  And now they're going to implode that dollar and sit back with the assets
[00:10:59.398 --> 00:11:16.606]  And they'll bring down a few hundred banks in front of you and even send a few CEOs to jail and they'll send a few bank chairmen and a few of these different brokerage firms that were selling all these mortgage-backed securities and they'll send a few hundred to jail for you and the big boys will sit back.
[00:11:18.247 --> 00:11:25.130]  And the next phase, instead of the type of government make work that we saw with
[00:11:25.993 --> 00:11:29.694]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, it's going to be tattletale squads and checkpoints.
[00:11:29.754 --> 00:11:31.855]  I mean, that's what the government says it's going to be.
[00:11:32.615 --> 00:11:39.037]  Just people in black uniforms milling around in food trucks, groveling to be part of the new power structure.
[00:11:39.357 --> 00:11:51.461]  America won't be about having a new patent or being a good computer engineer or being a good football coach or a good school teacher or being an inventor or being a good car salesman.
[00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:52.882]  It's going to be about who you know
[00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:55.584]  How many black uniforms you got in the family?
[00:11:55.944 --> 00:12:12.860]  It's all going to be the new feudal system of just groveling and a select elite and 1% owning everything and a giant slave underclass begging and pleading and everyone, like they do in third world countries, worshipping police and badges and being afraid of them and running.
[00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:15.143]  Oh, you haven't been to a third world country?
[00:12:15.163 --> 00:12:17.625]  Well, you're about to be in one, so just enjoy it.
[00:12:18.908 --> 00:12:23.972]  They're going to play different races off against each other and it's going to be big city race politics everywhere.
[00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:30.117]  We're going into very serious times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:31.218 --> 00:12:39.564]  And the very people that have destroyed our future, the very people that are destroying our currency, are the very ones who will be worshipped as the fixers on the news.
[00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:48.011]  They're the ones that we're going to have to learn to worship and thank for everything.
[00:12:49.804 --> 00:12:50.844]  That's how it works.
[00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:53.645]  Oh, you like 2 million cops?
[00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:54.525]  How about 4 million?
[00:12:54.726 --> 00:12:55.826]  How about 5 million?
[00:12:58.447 --> 00:13:00.007]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[00:13:00.027 --> 00:13:05.169]  You can be a narcotics drug lord, a Mexican Los Zetas, paramilitary truck bombing in Texas.
[00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:14.732]  You can be a government criminal, you know, flying in all sorts of drugs, or running scams, or stealing old ladies' pensions in these big banks.
[00:13:15.052 --> 00:13:15.952]  You're gonna be left alone.
[00:13:17.112 --> 00:13:18.773]  But you pull up in front of a Walmart,
[00:13:19.372 --> 00:13:28.479]  With your daughter and two of her friends, and you run in, run up to the front, just 8 to 10 yards away is what the news is reporting.
[00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:43.710]  She locks the car, got the heater on, runs over, it's sleeting outside, leaves the two-year-old in the car, runs over and puts $8.30 into the Salvation Army kitty, into the bucket.
[00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:46.552]  And within seconds,
[00:13:48.152 --> 00:13:51.574]  Within seconds, the Chicago cop was on her.
[00:13:54.296 --> 00:14:01.140]  And they charged her, and they CPS'd her kid, and only national outrage had them finally drop the charges.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.640]  They were gonna go ahead with it.
[00:14:04.521 --> 00:14:07.203]  The DA had said, yeah, put her in prison, take her kids.
[00:14:08.924 --> 00:14:12.086]  How many of you, you know those cops, they go out in their car,
[00:14:12.945 --> 00:14:19.475]  And, uh, you know, it's the wintertime and they forget something in the mailbox, so they forget to pull the trash can back from the curb, back up by the house.
[00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:20.476]  They do it all the time.
[00:14:20.757 --> 00:14:24.843]  I told my wife years ago, because I saw them in the news locally, she P.S.ing people every day.
[00:14:26.505 --> 00:14:27.766]  Neighbors are watching, folks.
[00:14:27.786 --> 00:14:30.609]  They're watching for you to just close the door with your kid in it.
[00:14:30.909 --> 00:14:31.229]  Boom!
[00:14:31.309 --> 00:14:31.750]  Sirens!
[00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:32.150]  Cops!
[00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.391]  They're just watching.
[00:14:33.411 --> 00:14:34.852]  They've been trained by... I told my wife.
[00:14:35.353 --> 00:14:37.234]  I said, do not even... She said, you're kidding.
[00:14:37.274 --> 00:14:39.737]  I mean, don't even... I forget something in the mailbox.
[00:14:39.777 --> 00:14:40.377]  Walk two feet.
[00:14:40.397 --> 00:14:41.018]  And I said, no.
[00:14:41.258 --> 00:14:42.559]  There's spies everywhere.
[00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:43.540]  They've trained them.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.341]  They're scum.
[00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:50.286]  The country's filled with filth and degenerate chicken-necked garbage who just love tattling.
[00:14:50.366 --> 00:14:53.829]  And their reality comes from television and the dramas.
[00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:58.111]  Where everything's set in New York or Chicago where guns are banned.
[00:14:58.352 --> 00:15:00.113]  So they see a gun mounted on the wall.
[00:15:00.393 --> 00:15:01.273]  They think it's illegal.
[00:15:01.313 --> 00:15:02.614]  They call the cops in Texas.
[00:15:02.934 --> 00:15:03.455]  Doesn't matter.
[00:15:03.475 --> 00:15:04.275]  They still hit you.
[00:15:04.495 --> 00:15:05.456]  And hit you hard.
[00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:06.817]  Doesn't matter if it's legal.
[00:15:06.937 --> 00:15:07.857]  This is the new country.
[00:15:08.398 --> 00:15:08.758]  Okay?
[00:15:08.778 --> 00:15:10.559]  Doesn't matter if it's legal to have a gun in your gun rack.
[00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:11.260]  They'll hit you.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.180]  They'll hit you hard.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.401]  That's why you don't see them anymore.
[00:15:13.541 --> 00:15:14.161]  They'll hit you.
[00:15:14.261 --> 00:15:15.202]  They'll hit you hard.
[00:15:15.342 --> 00:15:16.743]  They know how to bring a country down.
[00:15:16.923 --> 00:15:18.264]  And they've done a good job of it.
[00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:24.140]  And I've got stacks of news of four-year-olds refusing to take naps in their daycare.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.581]  So the cops come, hit them, hit them hard!
[00:15:26.981 --> 00:15:28.281]  Hit them, hit them hard!
[00:15:28.441 --> 00:15:29.802]  Hit them, hit them hard!
[00:15:30.242 --> 00:15:32.903]  It's all about maximum white-glove enforcement.
[00:15:33.123 --> 00:15:34.643]  You know what white-glove inspections are?
[00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:36.104]  What white-glove enforcement is?
[00:15:37.384 --> 00:15:45.287]  It's where they come in when you're a cadet at West Point and they put a white glove on and they run it all over the counters, under things, around the top of the light bulb.
[00:15:46.368 --> 00:15:47.548]  White-glove inspection.
[00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:49.346]  That's the new America.
[00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:54.770]  You light up and you get ready for a white glove inspection, you slave trash!
[00:15:57.433 --> 00:16:01.256]  You light up, I mean, cameras in the school bathrooms.
[00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:09.843]  And every week now, I just saw one, it was first I saw years ago in Tennessee and then in California, in their capital city.
[00:16:11.443 --> 00:16:15.366]  And then now Chicago yesterday, in fact it's somewhere in the stack, I want to cover that later.
[00:16:15.947 --> 00:16:24.875]  They said, oh yeah, we got cameras in the bathrooms, and in the halls, and in the rooms, and we watch everything they do, they've got audio, and now we're just wiring that into the police department.
[00:16:26.396 --> 00:16:28.338]  See, everything wired in the minute.
[00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:32.141]  You know, back when we were kids, you got in a fist fight in the hall, you just got in trouble.
[00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:36.885]  Now, SWAT teams, arrest, jail, everybody's going to be in the system.
[00:16:38.724 --> 00:16:50.435]  Everything's about, oh, we still have a Second Amendment in America, but 98% of people got in a fistfight when they were 12, so they lost their rights, because now they're saying you're going to lose your rights even if something happens when you're a juvenile.
[00:16:53.829 --> 00:17:01.410]  Don't worry too, those of you that like this system and like feeding on people, don't worry, your masters are going to rape you ten times harder than you rape us.
[00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:04.451]  So you just enjoy yourself.
[00:17:04.771 --> 00:17:11.692]  I want you to enjoy it real good, and you just take your time and you just have fun with all of it, okay?
[00:17:11.873 --> 00:17:13.573]  You promise me you'll do that for me?
[00:17:15.093 --> 00:17:17.274]  You promise me you'll make sure you enjoy yourselves?
[00:17:17.354 --> 00:17:17.714]  Good.
[00:17:18.074 --> 00:17:19.254]  Good, because hell's a coming.
[00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.890]  All right, I'm going to shut up and get into financial news.
[00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.734]  I'm going to come back to the next segment with key info, but I'm just so mad right now.
[00:17:30.496 --> 00:17:36.640]  Boy, the yuppies and good old boys and trendies and stockbrokers thought it was real cute that the Federal Reserve was private.
[00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:41.904]  And I'd have them swagger up to me in restaurants over the years and say, yeah, it's private.
[00:17:41.944 --> 00:17:43.465]  Look how good the economy is.
[00:17:43.745 --> 00:17:44.686]  Let it be fiat.
[00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:47.488]  And I said, yeah, but that gives the bankers the power
[00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:50.216]  Do you see how they're moving all our industry offshore?
[00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:53.418]  Do you see how they're subsidizing to get our businesses out of here?
[00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:57.202]  Do you see how they're laying on all these layers of bureaucracy?
[00:17:57.822 --> 00:18:09.612]  And I said, what they're going to do is they're going to implode the economy, and then we're going to have nothing to start back over with because all the industry's going to be gone, the people aren't going to live on the farms anymore, and they're going to have total control.
[00:18:10.032 --> 00:18:11.213]  I've got government documents.
[00:18:11.274 --> 00:18:11.914]  They've just left.
[00:18:12.214 --> 00:18:13.395]  Oh, sure you do.
[00:18:13.776 --> 00:18:15.137]  Oh, sure you do.
[00:18:15.477 --> 00:18:16.298]  Oh, it's funny.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.321]  It's all real funny.
[00:18:18.501 --> 00:18:20.123]  Okay, well get ready to laugh then.
[00:18:20.143 --> 00:18:22.165]  Kid, your time's coming.
[00:18:22.185 --> 00:18:24.827]  Your time of funniness is about to be here.
[00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:27.169]  It's all real cute, isn't it?
[00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.950]  This is what you want.
[00:18:29.351 --> 00:18:30.212]  This is what you get.
[00:18:30.232 --> 00:18:31.633]  This is what you want.
[00:18:32.013 --> 00:18:32.914]  This is what you get.
[00:18:32.974 --> 00:18:33.554]  You like it?
[00:18:33.835 --> 00:18:35.136]  You're going to get it now.
[00:18:37.068 --> 00:18:37.688]  But it won't matter.
[00:18:37.728 --> 00:18:38.849]  You'll rationalize.
[00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:44.510]  A trendy always rationalizes the new picture they see and decide that they're on the winning side even if they're losing.
[00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.051]  See, that's what a mentally ill loser does.
[00:18:47.271 --> 00:18:52.573]  That's what a delusional person who thinks their worldview is reality, that's how you think and operate.
[00:18:53.613 --> 00:19:00.355]  Like all these people who've been interviewed on national television from the stock market and Wall Street saying, I don't believe the dollar's been devalued.
[00:19:00.475 --> 00:19:01.275]  I think it's great.
[00:19:01.995 --> 00:19:03.916]  I choose to believe everything's fine.
[00:19:04.713 --> 00:19:09.254]  Just like jumping off a cliff without a parachute, you know, you just choose to believe you've got a parachute?
[00:19:11.815 --> 00:19:19.258]  And so they got us right where they wanted us, got us fully in their hands, totally in debt, impossible to ever get out of it as a nation.
[00:19:20.378 --> 00:19:21.638]  Mathematically impossible.
[00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:22.459]  Ever.
[00:19:22.779 --> 00:19:24.499]  100% taxes, forever wouldn't pay for it.
[00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:24.980]  It's over.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.460]  Just the interest on what they did.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.760]  And it's all out of nothing!
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.401]  But they got the world with it!
[00:19:30.781 --> 00:19:32.362]  They sold you on the scam!
[00:19:34.113 --> 00:19:37.234]  And now they're taking that dollar down all the way to nothing.
[00:19:37.434 --> 00:19:42.935]  Don't worry, though, it'll rise again with the Euro, a new Amaro, and the yuppies will then say, see?
[00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:47.456]  Those who were against the Pan-American Union, they didn't know how good it'd be for the economy!
[00:19:48.096 --> 00:19:56.078]  And then the globalists will loosen up a little bit down the road in five, six years with that, and you'll have to hear these idiots telling you how things work.
[00:19:56.418 --> 00:19:57.058]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:04.817]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.417 --> 00:20:14.368]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.809 --> 00:20:22.018]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.718 --> 00:20:28.221]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.721 --> 00:20:39.546]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.306 --> 00:20:42.387]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.847 --> 00:20:44.288]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:56.314]  Or, visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:56.774 --> 00:20:57.774]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:58.515 --> 00:21:03.277]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:05.378]  A new world order.
[00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:10.280]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:10.981 --> 00:21:12.741]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:21:12.921 --> 00:21:15.963]  Would their objective be world domination?
[00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:19.024]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[00:21:19.765 --> 00:21:27.099]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:30.094 --> 00:21:35.078]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.578 --> 00:21:39.061]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.421 --> 00:21:41.943]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:21:41.983 --> 00:21:42.984]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.004 --> 00:21:43.904]  They're not after money.
[00:21:43.924 --> 00:21:45.005]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.225 --> 00:21:45.946]  They're after power.
[00:21:45.966 --> 00:21:47.087]  That's what they have to use it for.
[00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:51.910]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.533]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:55.673 --> 00:21:56.233]  Endgame.
[00:21:56.253 --> 00:21:58.415]  Boom prep for global enslavement.
[00:21:58.856 --> 00:22:00.002]  You have been warned.
[00:22:00.766 --> 00:22:01.407]  It's a fact.
[00:22:01.627 --> 00:22:09.112]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:18.098]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:22:18.378 --> 00:22:28.925]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:35.229]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:22:35.449 --> 00:22:40.452]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:22:40.653 --> 00:22:45.135]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:22:45.296 --> 00:22:47.097]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:47.417]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:22:47.437 --> 00:22:48.017]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:22:48.057 --> 00:22:49.778]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:23:00.924 --> 00:23:13.668]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:23:14.069 --> 00:23:24.732]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:25.853]  We're good to go.
[00:23:39.966 --> 00:23:40.246]  I think so.
[00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:18.456]  Okay, let me stop ranting and actually get into the news here, and believe me, this is an incredible news day you're about to hear.
[00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:30.764]  I've been so busy ranting and raving about the economy, I didn't even tell you in the last 20 minutes, Ron Paul's coming up in the next hour to talk about his fight against getting
[00:24:31.618 --> 00:24:32.158]  We're good to go.
[00:24:49.764 --> 00:24:59.690]  You know, I was talking to the campaign this morning and I was saying we gotta have goals for the revolution now or it'll break apart and basically not be as potent.
[00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.952]  And I think that should be a national move against socialized healthcare.
[00:25:03.452 --> 00:25:04.833]  The country's already bankrupt.
[00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:07.955]  It's already falling apart.
[00:25:07.995 --> 00:25:09.816]  We don't want the government control over our lives.
[00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:11.097]  They're already trying to claim it's the law.
[00:25:11.117 --> 00:25:12.238]  We've got to take vaccines.
[00:25:12.518 --> 00:25:13.879]  We don't want healthcare rationing.
[00:25:13.899 --> 00:25:16.120]  I mean, this just isn't free healthcare, folks.
[00:25:17.003 --> 00:25:22.146]  We have to pay for it with all the bureaucracy added in, and then the government gets control of your life even that much more.
[00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:29.451]  I mean, I know you know that as an audience, but I'm telling them they need to pick up the fight against socialized health care, and then also NAFTA and GATT.
[00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:32.372]  NAFTA is up to be passed again.
[00:25:33.513 --> 00:25:40.637]  We need to have a national movement of all these Ron Paul supporters, all these patriots, against it, because that shoots down the North American Union.
[00:25:41.278 --> 00:25:42.559]  That is the North American Union.
[00:25:42.679 --> 00:25:46.481]  Out of that, as Vicente Fox has said, grows the North American Union.
[00:25:47.501 --> 00:25:48.462]  And then, of course, the war.
[00:25:48.962 --> 00:25:51.264]  That is a populist, constitutionalist policy.
[00:25:51.605 --> 00:25:54.267]  When he joins us, I'm going to recommend that be our course.
[00:25:54.967 --> 00:25:57.289]  For what it's worth, who wants to listen to Alex Jones?
[00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.632]  The Army needs something to do.
[00:26:00.652 --> 00:26:02.193]  We have plenty to do.
[00:26:02.233 --> 00:26:03.575]  The country is under attack.
[00:26:03.835 --> 00:26:04.896]  We're losing everything.
[00:26:05.156 --> 00:26:08.158]  We've got to mobilize the tens of millions of Ron Paul supporters now.
[00:26:09.722 --> 00:26:14.484]  I told everybody to break up locally and do that simultaneously and pick local issues to fight.
[00:26:14.544 --> 00:26:18.706]  Gun control, open borders, government corruption, government taxation, land grabs.
[00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:22.508]  But simultaneously we need direction because Ron Paul is a leader.
[00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:32.532]  He needs to say what he thinks and put out a directive calling for fighting these three individual moves by the globalists.
[00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:33.853]  The socialized health care,
[00:26:35.338 --> 00:26:38.019]  The North American unions are NAFTA and GATT, which we can shoot down.
[00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:39.439]  It's very unpopular right now.
[00:26:39.899 --> 00:26:40.700]  And, of course, the war.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.960]  And, of course, those are very popular issues as well.
[00:26:44.241 --> 00:26:48.182]  We can recruit and expand, not just maintain our size by doing that.
[00:26:48.262 --> 00:26:49.462]  Okay, I'm already digressing again.
[00:26:49.482 --> 00:26:53.443]  See, I'm so upset about the economy, folks.
[00:26:53.463 --> 00:26:55.724]  You'd think I'd start the show and tell you Ron Paul's coming up today.
[00:26:56.384 --> 00:26:57.104]  I didn't even do that.
[00:26:57.164 --> 00:27:01.125]  That's how just upset I am and crazed I am
[00:27:02.351 --> 00:27:18.037]  $1,010 an ounce gold, $111 a barrel oil, the dollar plunging even further, and look out, President Bush is set to give a speech about how bullish the economy is.
[00:27:18.537 --> 00:27:20.037]  Everyone knows you're a liar.
[00:27:21.278 --> 00:27:22.838]  Everyone knows you're a criminal.
[00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:26.280]  Everyone knows you have gay porn stars nightly at the White House.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.741]  Everyone knows you're a sniveling coward.
[00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:35.731]  Everyone knows you're an anti-gun, pro-open border, New World Order twit.
[00:27:36.712 --> 00:27:38.612]  And everybody knows you're a lying puppet.
[00:27:40.112 --> 00:27:44.573]  Now, the globalists know that when he comes out, he gave a speech earlier this week and everything plunged.
[00:27:44.914 --> 00:27:45.974]  They know it's going to plunge further.
[00:27:46.014 --> 00:27:46.594]  They want that.
[00:27:46.654 --> 00:27:47.374]  This is their time.
[00:27:47.594 --> 00:27:48.434]  They're making their move.
[00:27:49.515 --> 00:27:59.177]  But he's so delusional, I guarantee you this stupid twit, this cancer to the country, really thinks that
[00:27:59.847 --> 00:28:02.608]  He's gonna bully the economy and his legacy.
[00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:03.088]  No, no.
[00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.629]  You were set up, Bush.
[00:28:05.089 --> 00:28:05.869]  You were set up.
[00:28:05.889 --> 00:28:07.330]  Your bosses carried out the attacks.
[00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.570]  You thought you were gonna be a big stud.
[00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:10.431]  You're gonna have everything laid on you.
[00:28:10.851 --> 00:28:14.573]  They're gonna bring in hellish Democrats after you for the real reign of terror.
[00:28:16.353 --> 00:28:16.733]  Okay?
[00:28:17.494 --> 00:28:17.974]  Listen to this.
[00:28:18.014 --> 00:28:19.074]  Don't you all feel better now?
[00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:23.776]  He told us this week that we were not in a recession again and things plunged even further.
[00:28:25.237 --> 00:28:28.398]  President Bush plans a bullish speech on economy.
[00:28:29.284 --> 00:28:35.631]  President Bush will be in Manhattan Friday morning to make a speech to the Economic Club of New York, and I'm told that's already happened.
[00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:40.636]  His speech is intended to send a message that better times are coming.
[00:28:41.337 --> 00:28:42.598]  I thought we were in good times.
[00:28:42.658 --> 00:28:43.679]  He said we weren't in a recession.
[00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:45.621]  Tell you what, I bet this is already up on YouTube.
[00:28:45.761 --> 00:28:46.642]  Can we go grab it, John?
[00:28:47.423 --> 00:28:51.327]  Just type Bush speech and then click date added and it should be up there now.
[00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.529]  Thank you.
[00:28:53.769 --> 00:28:58.031]  The Bush administration is urging consumers to have confidence in the long-term future of the economy.
[00:28:58.051 --> 00:28:59.491]  That's right, get into even more debt.
[00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:08.954]  The president is expected to say that the benefits of a tax relief and economic stimulus package should be felt soon and the Federal Reserve is taking steps to encourage economic growth.
[00:29:12.096 --> 00:29:19.058]  You know, it's kind of like I had a good friend who died about a year ago and he had all these organ failure
[00:29:20.043 --> 00:29:21.343]  He was conscious.
[00:29:21.884 --> 00:29:25.105]  They had him on a respirator and they had to shoot him up with all these drugs to keep him awake.
[00:29:25.125 --> 00:29:27.766]  Because he had family that was coming in and out of town to see him.
[00:29:29.206 --> 00:29:29.927]  And he was conscious.
[00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:31.187]  They were telling him, you're about to die.
[00:29:31.207 --> 00:29:31.907]  And he was freaking out.
[00:29:31.927 --> 00:29:32.487]  He couldn't believe it.
[00:29:32.507 --> 00:29:33.648]  He was trying to kick and move.
[00:29:34.788 --> 00:29:38.710]  And uh... The more drugs they gave him, it would wake him up less and less.
[00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.011]  And finally he went into a coma and they took him off the respirator and he died peacefully.
[00:29:42.471 --> 00:29:43.451]  But that's America!
[00:29:44.472 --> 00:29:48.213]  They're just prolonging the agony and it'll be even worse the longer they prolong it.
[00:29:52.074 --> 00:29:55.102]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.005 --> 00:29:58.732]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.742 --> 00:30:06.105]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:30:06.265 --> 00:30:11.469]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:30:11.649 --> 00:30:16.452]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:30:16.713 --> 00:30:27.841]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[00:31:52.575 --> 00:31:54.919]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:32:01.354 --> 00:32:01.634]  Fact.
[00:32:01.814 --> 00:32:07.740]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:12.123]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:32:12.204 --> 00:32:19.630]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:20.551]  The solution!
[00:32:20.671 --> 00:32:24.714]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Qi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[00:33:04.175 --> 00:33:21.443]  The future man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive The interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown
[00:33:27.115 --> 00:33:48.547]  I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and me I've got a shotgun, a rifle and a four-wheel drive And a country boy can survive A country boy can survive
[00:33:52.575 --> 00:33:55.316]  I can plow a field all day long.
[00:33:55.416 --> 00:33:59.777]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[00:34:00.958 --> 00:34:06.579]  We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too.
[00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:11.581]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:20.124]  We grow good old tomatoes and homemade wine and country boy can survive.
[00:34:25.465 --> 00:34:28.387]  Alright, my friends, we're back live.
[00:34:28.448 --> 00:34:34.192]  Despite the Federal Reserve's efforts, Wall Street fears that big banks are in deep trouble.
[00:34:54.326 --> 00:34:56.468]  And I'm so upset and hyped up over all this.
[00:34:56.508 --> 00:34:59.690]  We got Ron Paul coming up in about 25 minutes, but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson.
[00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:06.416]  28 years in the stock market, in precious metals, in public and private offerings.
[00:35:07.196 --> 00:35:12.521]  Ted, we told him a few weeks ago it was going to go above $1,000, right up to $1,010 an ounce today.
[00:35:13.762 --> 00:35:16.364]  Give me your breakdown and analysis of what's happening right now.
[00:35:17.293 --> 00:35:19.515]  Well, you're right about that $1,000 thing.
[00:35:19.555 --> 00:35:21.296]  That's a psychological barrier.
[00:35:21.336 --> 00:35:26.299]  What that means now is that we're available to run up to $1,200 to $1,500 an ounce rather quickly.
[00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:31.342]  People just would hold off on that $1,000 mark.
[00:35:31.382 --> 00:35:32.803]  It was like this magical thing.
[00:35:33.344 --> 00:35:35.545]  Now when we see $1,000, people aren't going to care anymore.
[00:35:35.565 --> 00:35:39.768]  It's not going to be as big of a concern, and that just leaves room for it to move forward.
[00:35:40.428 --> 00:35:46.875]  Obviously the futures market people are buying long contracts and they're buying short contracts and they have stops to get in and get out.
[00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:55.324]  Right now what's happening is the short contracts are being stopped out and forces people that were originally sellers to become buyers and push it up even higher.
[00:35:55.824 --> 00:35:58.867]  And that's why you have resistance levels and you have
[00:35:59.728 --> 00:36:01.050]  And what is it?
[00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.892]  The floor level and the height of our camera.
[00:36:02.932 --> 00:36:04.533]  The two terms are losing my mind.
[00:36:05.114 --> 00:36:07.877]  There's just been so much activity going on Alex.
[00:36:08.037 --> 00:36:14.644]  It's quite literally crazy and obviously it has everything to do with the fact that the dollar has just been dropping like a stone.
[00:36:14.704 --> 00:36:18.768]  Now when you're looking at a dollar that's quoted at 71, you know that is just
[00:36:20.706 --> 00:36:22.527]  I mean, I said it yesterday.
[00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:25.208]  I'm predicting that the dollar will no longer buy food.
[00:36:25.228 --> 00:36:26.809]  It will no longer buy gold and silver.
[00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:34.393]  And the reason why I say that, Alex, is because what we have, our ailment here in the United States, is we have a watered-down money supply.
[00:36:35.231 --> 00:36:40.172]  And you can't fix a watered down money supply by adding more water.
[00:36:40.652 --> 00:36:41.993]  It just, it doesn't work.
[00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:45.333]  All it does is it creates more watered down money supply.
[00:36:45.353 --> 00:36:51.835]  It decreases the true value, the monetary value of the unit that we're using for our exchange.
[00:36:51.875 --> 00:36:53.995]  And that's what the Federal Reserve System is doing right now.
[00:36:54.015 --> 00:36:56.316]  All they want to do is continue to pump
[00:36:57.163 --> 00:36:58.344]  More money into the system.
[00:36:58.384 --> 00:37:00.485]  They pump, they pump, and they pump.
[00:37:01.026 --> 00:37:02.787]  And I want to be clear on this.
[00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.248]  They're doing it by design.
[00:37:04.608 --> 00:37:23.540]  If two years ago, a year ago, even a month ago, and it may still not be too late, if they came out and said, look, we're going to have to not cut interest rates, keep the dollar strong, we're going to have to cut government spending, we're going to have a strong dollar policy,
[00:37:24.614 --> 00:37:29.556]  We're going to get out of Iraq, done a few things, then the world would have stayed in dollars.
[00:37:29.596 --> 00:37:31.856]  But instead, they did the opposite.
[00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.337]  In fact, they did more than the opposite.
[00:37:33.737 --> 00:37:40.079]  They proactively went out and globally bad-mouthed their own dollar, and Cheney a year and a half ago dumped all his dollars.
[00:37:40.985 --> 00:37:44.847]  The companies they own and control dumped their dollars a long time ago.
[00:37:45.188 --> 00:37:45.928]  They're globalists.
[00:37:46.008 --> 00:37:47.169]  They're selling the country out.
[00:37:47.429 --> 00:37:50.831]  They want to implode the economy, just like the IMF document state.
[00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:56.034]  It's called the IMF riot, because once it really implodes, then they really have the fire sailed.
[00:37:56.394 --> 00:37:57.675]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:37:57.815 --> 00:38:05.540]  And that's why we see so many countries and so many individuals trying to get away from the United States dollar, because they can see what's going on.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.622]  The Federal Reserve System, actually, Alex, is losing control.
[00:38:09.382 --> 00:38:11.983]  You're right about the globalists.
[00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.984]  They want to have a world currency.
[00:38:14.484 --> 00:38:20.287]  And the Federal Reserve System has enjoyed the ability to have control of the United States of America.
[00:38:21.707 --> 00:38:25.789]  Like you said, there are fights that go on amongst the bankers, the central bankers.
[00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:31.151]  World War I and World War II are real good examples of how they can get into scrimmages amongst each other.
[00:38:31.931 --> 00:38:46.101]  The Federal Reserve System doesn't want to lose control and give it over to a world currency either, but the powers that be above them are going, let it die, because then we'll scoop up the United States and we'll have them just like we got Europe two years ago.
[00:38:46.921 --> 00:38:51.244]  We are sitting in a situation now where the United States sovereignty is on the line.
[00:38:56.267 --> 00:39:01.730]  Our liberty is being sold out to a bunch of bankers, and it's crazy that we go with this.
[00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:09.355]  The Constitution says that we should have gold and silver as our money, and we should have a second option.
[00:39:09.395 --> 00:39:11.316]  We could have that here in the United States.
[00:39:11.656 --> 00:39:12.176]  The U.S.
[00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:15.858]  government right now at this particular time could say, okay, you have a choice.
[00:39:15.878 --> 00:39:19.581]  You can go with the Federal Reserve note, or you can go with the United States currency.
[00:39:19.741 --> 00:39:20.481]  One or the other.
[00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:21.782]  You decide what you want to trade.
[00:39:22.142 --> 00:39:26.905]  But I know, and as well as you know, Alex, that if they go to that, that Federal Reserve has no chance at all.
[00:39:26.965 --> 00:39:28.346]  It's just going to fail immediately.
[00:39:28.666 --> 00:39:30.607]  But that would put us back in world status.
[00:39:30.647 --> 00:39:32.508]  We'd be the most powerful country out there.
[00:39:33.249 --> 00:39:38.572]  You know, I mean, at this particular time, it's crazy that we don't do that.
[00:39:38.612 --> 00:39:39.513]  But you're right about this.
[00:39:39.553 --> 00:39:43.915]  The yuppies and the people that don't know think that the government should bail out all of our problems.
[00:39:43.936 --> 00:39:45.476]  We're having economic problems right now.
[00:39:45.557 --> 00:39:47.218]  So what do we expect the government to do?
[00:39:47.558 --> 00:39:50.440]  We want them to put out stimulus packages.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.160]  Well, stimulus
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.964]  And we're having problems because government got too big to begin with.
[00:39:55.344 --> 00:39:55.824]  Exactly.
[00:39:56.085 --> 00:39:59.448]  Too much spending and not enough revenues, income.
[00:39:59.768 --> 00:40:03.172]  You know, you just only can tax the taxpayers so much.
[00:40:03.212 --> 00:40:06.214]  You can only take so much from the people of the United States of America.
[00:40:06.815 --> 00:40:14.843]  And so rather than showing up with taxes, now they're just devaluating the currency that we get paid in here in the United States and we're forced to use as legal tender.
[00:40:15.795 --> 00:40:19.159]  You know, just recently when that North Fed thing fell apart and the U.S.
[00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:24.906]  Treasury came in and confiscated all their gold and silver, for those of you who don't think confiscation happens, it did happen here.
[00:40:24.926 --> 00:40:26.087]  It happened just last year.
[00:40:26.708 --> 00:40:33.336]  Confiscation of their gold and silver occurred because there was a currency that was competing with the United States dollar that was solid.
[00:40:34.102 --> 00:40:35.703]  That was solid and sound.
[00:40:35.723 --> 00:40:38.405]  It had gold and silver behind it.
[00:40:38.425 --> 00:40:44.828]  In fact, the Feds said in the filing they did that because it was, quote, competing and could hurt the Federal Reserve.
[00:40:45.289 --> 00:40:47.070]  It's exactly what that means.
[00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:55.935]  And that competition should be occurring on a government level, not at some private individual's smelting thing.
[00:40:56.115 --> 00:40:57.276]  Well, Chad, here's the deal.
[00:40:58.757 --> 00:41:01.438]  And you might tell them to close that door or whatever's going on there in the background.
[00:41:03.496 --> 00:41:11.680]  But, look, bottom line for everybody out there to understand, this is very, very simple.
[00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:23.905]  We need to protect ourselves, and you still have British sovereigns and European francs at the price they were a week and a half ago.
[00:41:24.905 --> 00:41:28.187]  You are still able to lock that in, more of those in the last few days.
[00:41:29.242 --> 00:41:39.270]  And it's surprising how long you've been able to do this, but how much longer are you going to be able to lock them in at $20, $30, $40 below what gold is now?
[00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:50.218]  Well, Alex, right now gold is up over $1,000 an ounce, and I did lock this stuff in when the gold was in the $9.90s now, and it catches up with me real fast.
[00:41:50.338 --> 00:41:55.622]  Obviously, I only can secure so much of a position, then I have to go back out in the marketplace and replace that position.
[00:41:55.842 --> 00:41:57.744]  Okay, so you are on a new position.
[00:41:58.104 --> 00:42:00.567]  You're not at the 970, 980 like you were a week ago.
[00:42:00.587 --> 00:42:05.812]  Well, that particular package sold out, but I do have British Sovereigns.
[00:42:05.852 --> 00:42:12.699]  I've got some of them still at the 271 level, and I have the French and the Swiss.
[00:42:12.779 --> 00:42:13.921]  Wherever they come, they come.
[00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:17.584]  But we do have some of those left still at 216.
[00:42:17.624 --> 00:42:24.889]  And here's a thing that's absolutely rock bottom as far as I'm concerned, is those walking liberties.
[00:42:24.929 --> 00:42:28.312]  We still have a few of those and the rolls are 210.
[00:42:28.832 --> 00:42:32.375]  But I can tell you right now, all this stuff is becoming scarce.
[00:42:32.495 --> 00:42:34.617]  Not only just the gold, but the silver as well.
[00:42:34.657 --> 00:42:39.641]  The silver was hard to get to start with when the economy was not favoring gold and silver.
[00:42:39.701 --> 00:42:41.222]  Now that we've got the business volume,
[00:42:41.862 --> 00:42:47.726]  I can tell you right now, the silver dollars that I was trading, they're almost impossible to get at this particular time.
[00:42:48.086 --> 00:42:51.889]  I was talking about those quarters and dimes, they're gone now.
[00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:55.051]  The walking liberty halves, that's going to be another thing.
[00:42:55.071 --> 00:43:03.696]  I mean, it's just like, whatever I focus on and concentrate, I seem to be able to get in and get some supply, but then when I go back to my suppliers to get some more, it's tough to get.
[00:43:03.976 --> 00:43:07.078]  Five dollar commemorative gold pieces, we've talked about those.
[00:43:07.378 --> 00:43:09.820]  I have those right now, I only can get limited quantities of them.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:15.965]  The issue right now is that more than 3% of the people want gold, but there's not enough gold to go around.
[00:43:16.626 --> 00:43:19.888]  You take that $10 Olympic coin that we've talked about so many times.
[00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:22.491]  There's about 700,000 of those out there.
[00:43:22.511 --> 00:43:29.677]  Well, 700,000 might sound like a big number, but I would imagine if everybody in the city of Austin wanted to have two of them, there wouldn't be enough to go around.
[00:43:30.177 --> 00:43:30.417]  You know?
[00:43:30.737 --> 00:43:32.139]  And that's just one place.
[00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:33.780]  Well, I want to be clear about this.
[00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:38.324]  When a B-52 pilot has their little emergency package,
[00:43:39.495 --> 00:43:48.061]  In there is drugs, in there is some gold coins, some British sovereigns, in there is some basic things for them to survive.
[00:43:48.461 --> 00:43:54.945]  A fiat currency, once people lose faith in it, goes to zero very, very quickly.
[00:43:54.965 --> 00:44:00.849]  And I'm not going to belabor this anymore, I've got a bunch of other news, financial news, world news, military news.
[00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:02.585]  I don't want to get into.
[00:44:02.985 --> 00:44:13.473]  But bottom line, Ted has gold, and we're talking prices he set in for these coins from when gold was $20 cheaper than it is now.
[00:44:14.113 --> 00:44:15.655]  And I told you to get into gold when it was $264.
[00:44:16.015 --> 00:44:17.656]  I told you to get into gold when it was $300.
[00:44:17.796 --> 00:44:19.578]  I told you to get into gold when it was $400.
[00:44:19.898 --> 00:44:23.701]  And the mainstream media says, oh no, wait until it falls back down again.
[00:44:24.021 --> 00:44:24.942]  I told you to get in when it was $500, $600, $700, $800, $900, $1000.
[00:44:30.004 --> 00:44:38.033]  Gold to be at 1980 levels for real dollar purchasing will be over $2,200 and now rising.
[00:44:38.514 --> 00:44:44.100]  Silver will be over $100 an ounce when it comes to true parity with the dollar.
[00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.502]  And that's current parity.
[00:44:45.742 --> 00:44:47.884]  If the dollar continues to slide, it's only going to be more.
[00:44:48.185 --> 00:44:50.167]  They are not going to be able to suppress this.
[00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:54.408]  Bottom line, you're locking in some of the real wealth you have.
[00:44:54.969 --> 00:44:57.009]  The globalists hate it when you buy gold.
[00:44:57.389 --> 00:44:59.030]  It is the biggest secret out there.
[00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.031]  If you want to protect yourself, give the brokers a call.
[00:45:02.411 --> 00:45:04.332]  The European francs are excellent.
[00:45:04.592 --> 00:45:06.633]  The British sovereign is the best deal Ted's got.
[00:45:07.293 --> 00:45:09.834]  The silver, when you come to silver, is an insane deal.
[00:45:10.154 --> 00:45:11.994]  And I'm serious, because I've been talking to Ted.
[00:45:12.335 --> 00:45:15.436]  Ted is having trouble now securing this and getting it in.
[00:45:15.456 --> 00:45:19.277]  This latest group, if there's a big response today, probably won't even be there tomorrow.
[00:45:19.617 --> 00:45:20.977]  Ted, do people need to call you now?
[00:45:21.257 --> 00:45:26.539]  Yeah, without a question you want to get into the position now because the dollar is falling like a free fall.
[00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:27.319]  Gold just broke $1,000.
[00:45:27.899 --> 00:45:29.219]  It's going to go well beyond that.
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:31.660]  It also frees up silver to go up to $30.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.381]  There's just so many things that are going on right now in the precious metals business.
[00:45:35.741 --> 00:45:37.101]  You need to get in there.
[00:45:37.342 --> 00:45:41.963]  You're going to be going to the grocery store and you're going to hear the tellers talking about why they should be buying gold.
[00:45:43.343 --> 00:45:44.224]  That's catching on.
[00:45:44.284 --> 00:45:45.505]  Right now, the dollar's falling.
[00:45:45.545 --> 00:45:48.007]  People are waking up to this and there's not enough to go around.
[00:45:48.387 --> 00:45:50.849]  Not enough to everybody here in the United States, that's for sure.
[00:45:51.149 --> 00:45:52.310]  And China wants it too?
[00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:53.311]  I mean, my goodness.
[00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:58.455]  Oh no, type in, uh, gold shortages hurt jewelry manufacturers.
[00:45:58.515 --> 00:46:03.578]  I've probably seen 15 articles last month about jewelry makers getting hit hard.
[00:46:03.638 --> 00:46:05.520]  I mean, folks, it's happening.
[00:46:06.268 --> 00:46:07.168]  It truly is, Alex.
[00:46:07.228 --> 00:46:08.809]  The dollar, this is for real.
[00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:11.369]  You're talking about the yuppies saying, hey, everything's great.
[00:46:11.409 --> 00:46:15.310]  You've got George Bush up there trying to tell everybody that the economy's in great shape.
[00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:15.850]  It's not.
[00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.930]  Everybody knows that.
[00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.551]  And everybody's going to need hard assets.
[00:46:19.611 --> 00:46:24.012]  And this is the only way that you can put something in your pocket that's liquid, that you can sell tomorrow.
[00:46:24.052 --> 00:46:25.432]  I can take you anywhere in the world.
[00:46:25.452 --> 00:46:26.672]  You're going to be able to trade it.
[00:46:26.712 --> 00:46:29.253]  The United States dollar is not going to be able to do that in the future.
[00:46:29.733 --> 00:46:30.753]  Get out of the dollar.
[00:46:31.013 --> 00:46:31.713]  Get into gold.
[00:46:31.753 --> 00:46:33.174]  Look at your stock portfolios.
[00:46:33.194 --> 00:46:34.854]  Look at every asset that you have.
[00:46:35.414 --> 00:46:37.655]  Seriously, because... And I want to explain something.
[00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:53.558]  The stock market's down 400 points or whatever today, but what I want you to do is I want you to understand that just like oil is $111 a barrel, just like gold is $1,010 an ounce, and that's before it's even delivered.
[00:46:54.638 --> 00:46:57.558]  Just like all that's happening, your stock market is the same thing.
[00:46:57.658 --> 00:46:58.839]  It's not really $12,000, okay?
[00:47:00.817 --> 00:47:04.080]  It's below $6,000 in your $2,000 value.
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.601]  This is very simple.
[00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:07.883]  And Ted, I've been talking about this for more than a decade.
[00:47:07.903 --> 00:47:10.225]  Some of you people are finally getting it.
[00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:17.971]  I mean, the White House reporters have to ask the White House press secretary, is it true that oil's so much because the dollar's devalued?
[00:47:18.311 --> 00:47:19.833]  Like they're two-year-old children?
[00:47:20.473 --> 00:47:22.794]  I mean, why do they need the White House to tell them?
[00:47:22.934 --> 00:47:30.357]  Well, that's the crazy thing about it, and obviously the White House is trying to put a positive spin on what's going on, and there's nothing positive about it at all.
[00:47:31.098 --> 00:47:37.400]  And to be able to go, well, if my dollar's falling in value, does that mean, is that why oil's going up?
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.001]  I mean, to me it's just
[00:47:39.881 --> 00:47:47.765]  Obvious, and obviously it's obvious to the White House too, but if the person's going to get fired for admitting that, you know, basically they're seeking permission.
[00:47:47.785 --> 00:47:49.445]  Hey, can we tell them what the truth is now?
[00:47:49.725 --> 00:47:50.986]  You know, that's what they're saying.
[00:47:52.208 --> 00:47:54.729]  But it destroys confidence even more to have them.
[00:47:54.769 --> 00:48:00.912]  But I guess 30% of the population, if Bush set out glasses of cyanide and told them to drink it, they'd do it.
[00:48:01.492 --> 00:48:02.533]  But again, Bush runs nothing.
[00:48:02.553 --> 00:48:04.313]  He's a total puppet.
[00:48:04.373 --> 00:48:06.334]  He's going to be left holding the bag for all this.
[00:48:06.574 --> 00:48:12.737]  They're going to move into the next administration, who will then take the blame for the next leg of the globalist marathon they're running on us.
[00:48:13.077 --> 00:48:15.118]  Ted, give them the toll-free number to get those deals.
[00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:15.798]  Yeah, you can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:48:15.818 --> 00:48:16.139]  I'll slow down.
[00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:16.219]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:48:22.148 --> 00:48:26.076]  Six, eight, six, two, two, three, seven, Alex, now.
[00:48:26.376 --> 00:48:27.037]  Not later.
[00:48:27.057 --> 00:48:28.861]  Ted, I've never heard you sound this excited.
[00:48:28.881 --> 00:48:29.642]  You almost sound like me.
[00:48:31.561 --> 00:48:32.801]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[00:48:33.282 --> 00:48:50.233]  I get here in the morning, I grab a package, I bring it down, I ship it, I get back into the shipping area, my gal broke her wrist, so I've got to be packaging this stuff, and then I get out and do a commercial, and then I get into the radio with you, and then we handle all these orders that are coming in, we get them inputted as fast as we can, we receive the money, we get the stuff shipped out as quickly as we can.
[00:48:50.793 --> 00:48:51.253]  It's crazy.
[00:48:51.293 --> 00:48:54.615]  I'll have to sleep someday in the future.
[00:48:54.676 --> 00:48:56.777]  We'll put it on my schedule.
[00:48:57.498 --> 00:49:00.421]  No, but I'm saying I also hear you that you're just excited.
[00:49:00.461 --> 00:49:01.142]  You can feel it.
[00:49:01.342 --> 00:49:05.267]  Can't you feel the... I mean, frankly, folks, I have the feeling of doom every day.
[00:49:05.527 --> 00:49:07.790]  Well, excited in kind of a sad way.
[00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:13.116]  I mean, I've been talking about this Federal Reserve Bank and trying to get as many creature from Jekyll Island bucks in people's hands.
[00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:16.217]  Since you were at KJFK and doing that.
[00:49:16.257 --> 00:49:17.358]  I mean, I was doing it before that.
[00:49:17.638 --> 00:49:19.759]  I mean, I was just trying to wake people up to the system.
[00:49:20.239 --> 00:49:25.821]  And it's nice to be able to see as many people that we've had supporting Ron Paul.
[00:49:25.941 --> 00:49:32.644]  And every time I'm at a rally for him and he starts talking about the Fed, they stand and cheer that he wants to shut it down.
[00:49:33.204 --> 00:49:36.826]  And I'm seeing thousands of people right now.
[00:49:36.866 --> 00:49:39.767]  I was lucky to see ten people stand up and support that idea.
[00:49:40.567 --> 00:49:41.087]  Twenty years ago.
[00:49:41.267 --> 00:49:41.807]  Absolutely.
[00:49:41.847 --> 00:49:42.848]  The enemy's in trouble.
[00:49:43.328 --> 00:49:48.269]  Give them the number again, Ted.
[00:49:48.289 --> 00:49:50.550]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:50.930]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:49:51.591 --> 00:49:53.211]  Thanks for joining us for this segment, Ted.
[00:49:53.271 --> 00:49:54.411]  Yeah, you're welcome, Alex.
[00:49:55.312 --> 00:49:58.573]  Folks, I believe gold's going to hit $2,000.
[00:49:59.853 --> 00:50:01.334]  I believe that by the end of this year.
[00:50:01.514 --> 00:50:05.295]  Now, I told you a couple months ago that I believe by the end of March we'll hit $1,000.
[00:50:07.688 --> 00:50:09.369]  I've been saying that for at least a month and a half.
[00:50:09.449 --> 00:50:11.109]  By the end of March, a thousand.
[00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:13.750]  Just looking at the graphs, studying the data.
[00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:19.792]  I mean, I spend hours and hours every night reading financial data, reading different reports, and then I get on air and I just kind of go wild.
[00:50:20.172 --> 00:50:24.514]  There's no way to even articulate all of it, and I just start screaming because it's so insane.
[00:50:25.734 --> 00:50:32.636]  But I personally believe that gold will have its ups and downs, but if you look at the long-term graph, it's straight up.
[00:50:33.356 --> 00:50:34.877]  And I believe that in the next eight months,
[00:50:35.965 --> 00:50:38.367]  You are going to see gold hit $2,000 an ounce.
[00:50:39.448 --> 00:50:45.713]  And unfortunately, I believe that's going to happen because this country is literally going under.
[00:50:46.454 --> 00:50:46.774]  Okay?
[00:50:47.815 --> 00:50:49.176]  Going under, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:49.697 --> 00:50:50.357]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:50.377 --> 00:50:50.798]  Stay with me.
[00:51:01.937 --> 00:51:03.619]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[00:51:03.939 --> 00:51:07.442]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:51:07.562 --> 00:51:09.444]  But in liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:09.724 --> 00:51:12.787]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:13.087 --> 00:51:16.971]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[00:51:16.991 --> 00:51:17.231]  We're good.
[00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:38.307]  Directly to your computer or iPhone and share it with others.
[00:51:38.707 --> 00:51:44.530]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:49.272]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.

[00:52:49.882 --> 00:52:53.725]  Ask yourself, why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the US?
[00:52:53.985 --> 00:52:56.326]  This product is also great for pets and animals.

[00:53:02.043 --> 00:53:08.566]  With oil at $105 per barrel and counting, radical changes need to be implemented if we're to avert becoming a third world nation.
[00:53:08.946 --> 00:53:13.548]  It's time to jump on the next wave of free energy and radical natural alternative health solutions.
[00:53:13.808 --> 00:53:15.529]  Introducing Oregon Products.
[00:53:15.889 --> 00:53:22.112]  Oregon is the universal life force, the basic building block of all organic and inorganic matter in the material world.
[00:53:22.412 --> 00:53:26.014]  Oregon Electro Medicine is the wave of the future, dating back to the late 1800s.
[00:53:27.114 --> 00:53:33.560]  Wilhelm Reich Oregon uses cloud buster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic energy savings of up to 25%.

[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.562]  Shifting gears briefly as we wait for Ron Paul to join us in the next hour.
[00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:23.034]  I learned when I was in high school that Gloria Steinem was a CIA officer, black ops commander.
[00:54:25.116 --> 00:54:28.778]  She was in psychological warfare in domestic operations.
[00:54:30.319 --> 00:54:33.661]  And they had to get the kids into the schools to be able to fully dumb them down.
[00:54:33.681 --> 00:54:36.843]  They had to get the women out of the houses.
[00:54:37.944 --> 00:54:40.546]  Now again, I'm not saying women should all be barefoot and pregnant.
[00:54:40.566 --> 00:54:43.728]  My point is, I'm coldly telling you what they did to you.
[00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:46.591]  Okay, just absolute fact.
[00:54:48.292 --> 00:55:01.435]  They knew that if you had the women at home raising the children, that that influence was going to be there, and that the influence that she was given by her mother, and the influence that her mother was given by her mother, back tens of thousands of years.
[00:55:03.016 --> 00:55:04.136]  They had to cut that off.
[00:55:05.596 --> 00:55:10.858]  And they said, we want the woman paying taxes, we want the child in our government schools, that's where we're going to dumb them down.
[00:55:10.918 --> 00:55:12.258]  They even say, dumb them down.
[00:55:13.078 --> 00:55:19.420]  They say they're too intelligent, they know how to read too well, this is official government documents, and please don't call in and say, well then read them on air.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.341]  I've had all these education experts on.
[00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:24.442]  If you want to go look them up, I sell books that have all the quotes in them.
[00:55:25.302 --> 00:55:25.743]  It's there.
[00:55:27.543 --> 00:55:32.465]  Just like when I mentioned Gloria Steinem's a CIA officer, people always email me and say, show proof!
[00:55:34.346 --> 00:55:36.487]  I've probably done 20, 30 shows over 13 years on it.
[00:55:39.574 --> 00:55:41.795]  I can't each time go back and pull it up for you.
[00:55:42.075 --> 00:55:43.176]  You go look into it!
[00:55:43.976 --> 00:55:48.978]  Now, the reason I brought that up is here's Bloomberg, one of the largest financial wires in the world.
[00:55:51.079 --> 00:55:51.539]  Right here.
[00:55:52.639 --> 00:55:55.361]  What Gloria Steinem and Henry Kissinger have in common.
[00:55:56.101 --> 00:55:57.221]  C.I.A.
[00:55:57.582 --> 00:55:57.942]  Pay.
[00:56:00.683 --> 00:56:01.983]  And you can go read this for yourself.
[00:56:02.043 --> 00:56:03.364]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:04.426 --> 00:56:15.133]  What Gloria Steinem and Henry Kissinger have in common is CIA pay, and ooh, it's big breaking news that both of them were CIA operatives in disinfo campaigns.
[00:56:16.014 --> 00:56:17.195]  Boy, I really needed to know that.
[00:56:18.115 --> 00:56:21.718]  His code name, of course, is well known in the CIA, but it's less known.
[00:56:22.518 --> 00:56:28.983]  It was Bohr, or THE Bohr, and that was his KGB handle.
[00:56:29.023 --> 00:56:30.964]  He was a triple agent,
[00:56:32.463 --> 00:56:34.626]  He'd been an agent to the Nazis before that.
[00:56:36.267 --> 00:56:39.791]  But you can read all about it if you want, Henry Kissinger.
[00:56:40.672 --> 00:56:41.674]  CIA operative.
[00:56:42.094 --> 00:56:44.297]  His handler, of course, was David Rockefeller.
[00:56:45.258 --> 00:56:48.782]  David, by the mid-30s, was already in Germany running ops.
[00:56:50.433 --> 00:56:53.954]  Doing business with Hitler, but also surveying him, surveilling him.
[00:56:54.374 --> 00:56:55.834]  He's even bragged about it a few times.
[00:56:56.334 --> 00:56:59.855]  So his case officer, and you're like, wait a minute, the CIA didn't exist until 1947.
[00:57:00.535 --> 00:57:03.436]  Sure, sure it didn't.
[00:57:04.516 --> 00:57:05.877]  Believe that piece of history too.
[00:57:06.277 --> 00:57:07.477]  Yes, it had another name.
[00:57:07.497 --> 00:57:09.577]  It was called Army Intelligence.
[00:57:10.718 --> 00:57:16.839]  Now, what Gloria Steinem and Henry Kissinger have in common, CIA pay.
[00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:23.995]  The Front Organization was one of the earliest and most trusted weapons in the psychological Cold War between the U.S.
[00:57:24.035 --> 00:57:24.836]  and the Soviet Union.
[00:57:24.856 --> 00:57:27.058]  See, this is all bull.
[00:57:27.879 --> 00:57:32.965]  It's how they were Gloria Steinem and Kissinger were fighting commies.
[00:57:34.047 --> 00:57:35.228]  Of course they were.
[00:57:35.248 --> 00:57:38.332]  These seemingly independent and high-minded
[00:57:39.165 --> 00:57:50.129]  Anticommunist entities were often created or co-opted by the bright young spies who become the founding fathers of the Central Intelligence Agency, together with groups formed with one U.S.
[00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:59.832]  agent called Mighty Wurlitzer, an organ for playing variations on an anticommunist fugue.
[00:57:59.912 --> 00:58:07.454]  And then you read it, and it's all just disinfo, but they admit they're both CIA operatives, and how they ran it all, and how she started Miss Magazine, and
[00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:12.091]  It just goes on and on.
[00:58:13.672 --> 00:58:14.853]  And now, how are you women?
[00:58:14.873 --> 00:58:15.673]  You doing real good?
[00:58:16.334 --> 00:58:19.296]  Oh yeah, the family's gone, you can't get a man to stay at home and work for you.
[00:58:20.056 --> 00:58:22.598]  You're working two or three jobs, everybody treats you like crap.
[00:58:23.058 --> 00:58:23.759]  You have nothing.
[00:58:27.061 --> 00:58:30.283]  Your kids at school, brain damage from the shots you didn't listen and gave them.
[00:58:32.304 --> 00:58:33.665]  Yeah, you got what you wanted, didn't you?
[00:58:34.186 --> 00:58:38.909]  CIA ran a big black op on you, and now they got you working for the man.
[00:58:43.214 --> 00:58:44.617]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.657 --> 00:58:47.202]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:02.218]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.878 --> 00:59:03.699]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.439 --> 00:59:06.360]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.602]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.203 --> 00:59:14.325]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.148 --> 00:59:23.171]  We are now into our number two.
[00:59:24.711 --> 00:59:26.753]  We're waiting for Ron Paul and the Wings.
[00:59:27.717 --> 00:59:28.778]  You just popped a mire, John.
[00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:29.218]  What'd you say?
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.880]  Okay, we're still waiting on Paul.
[00:59:33.721 --> 00:59:38.303]  He's on the Hill today in Congress and sometimes these interviews can fluctuate up to an hour.
[00:59:39.044 --> 00:59:41.365]  So he's supposedly going to be on in five minutes.
[00:59:41.846 --> 00:59:45.348]  He may be on next hour because there's voting going on, I'm told.
[00:59:47.229 --> 00:59:50.631]  But Ron Paul is joining us sometime in this hour or the next.
[00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:59.842]  This is a nice surprise to get a call from Jesse Benton this morning, and to be able to get the Congressman on the show for you today.
[00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:06.644]  We're going to be talking about where the Ron Paul Revolution goes from here, what's happening with the dollar, the currency, that he's been talking about so long.
[01:00:07.284 --> 01:00:12.685]  And how we give this army, the Ron Paul Army, the Liberty Army, some missions.
[01:00:12.865 --> 01:00:15.866]  Because if you don't give them some missions, it's going to fall apart.
[01:00:15.926 --> 01:00:17.226]  Now, the march is one mission.
[01:00:18.006 --> 01:00:20.887]  That's a media spectacular, and get the word out, but we need to
[01:00:21.514 --> 01:00:25.517]  It's some other missions, I believe, and that's going after socialized health care, trying to stop that.
[01:00:26.578 --> 01:00:33.304]  Trying to end, of course, NAFTA that's being, they're trying to ram back through right now.
[01:00:34.004 --> 01:00:34.645]  So NAFTA.
[01:00:35.786 --> 01:00:44.153]  And of course, shooting down those that are politically trying to push a continuation of the war.
[01:00:44.633 --> 01:00:46.475]  Ending that meat grinder for our troops.
[01:00:48.172 --> 01:00:57.899]  So that's what I believe, and I believe it should be codified into basic battle plans for the grassroots, maybe on one sheet with objective goals, and just turn the people loose.
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.361]  People want objectives in this fight.
[01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:11.549]  I think people would listen to me with objectives, but I think Ron Paul is more stately and a bit more austere and a better figurehead for all of this, plus he has a great intellect.
[01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:13.330]  But we'll see what he thinks about that.
[01:01:14.702 --> 01:01:16.127]  When he pops in with us.
[01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:21.605]  Yeah, Bloomberg today and I just saw this and I thought you know I'll just mention it because
[01:01:22.794 --> 01:01:30.618]  Every few months when I've got a guest on about education or how they're destroying the family and we're reading all these documents, I'll just throw in, yeah, Gloria Steinem was a CIA agent.
[01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:32.619]  They gave her millions of dollars to start Ms.
[01:01:32.659 --> 01:01:33.180]  Magazine.
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:34.220]  It's been declassified.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:39.683]  It was meant to get women into the workforce and break up the family and let the state move in over the family.
[01:01:39.703 --> 01:01:44.145]  And they're now saying in federal and state court that the state owns your children, that the parents don't.
[01:01:44.506 --> 01:01:46.447]  They're saying that you don't have rights over your children.
[01:01:46.807 --> 01:01:47.927]  Europe is saying that too.
[01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:50.949]  I mean, this is in their own documents, but now they're openly announcing it.
[01:01:52.961 --> 01:01:57.305]  And so, you know, the big fight is against our families.
[01:01:57.725 --> 01:01:59.907]  We're about to break, so we're holding through the break.
[01:02:00.367 --> 01:02:01.668]  It's Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:02:01.688 --> 01:02:06.012]  We're extremely honored to have him joining us from up on the hill today in D.C.
[01:02:06.172 --> 01:02:09.795]  Congressman, congratulations on defeating the Pedanphiles.
[01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:11.376]  Well, thank you.
[01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:12.417]  I appreciate that.
[01:02:12.717 --> 01:02:14.699]  I was glad we were able to do that.
[01:02:15.439 --> 01:02:18.842]  When people know what the message is, I think they're quite willing to vote for it.
[01:02:19.779 --> 01:02:25.890]  Absolutely, and we've got you for about a minute more and about 15 minutes in the next segment, but in the minute we've got, what do you want to talk about?
[01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:28.495]  What do you think is most important today as you join us?
[01:02:29.548 --> 01:02:38.370]  Well, the thing that I watch the most is what we've talked about many times, and that is the reflection of a flawed system, and it's reflected in the value of the currency.
[01:02:38.911 --> 01:02:49.053]  Great nations go by the wayside, you know, when they ruin the money and inflate, and that's what we're witnessing here on a daily basis, and here we've seen gold hit $1,000 an ounce.
[01:02:49.534 --> 01:02:52.654]  It's voting against the dollar, for sure.
[01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:58.316]  All day yesterday, the Drudge Report, the gold in, dollar out.
[01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:07.595]  Well, that's what's happening, and I'm sure they're working very, very hard to try to moderate the exit from the dollars.
[01:03:07.635 --> 01:03:16.703]  You know, the plunge protection team is always involved in planning things, and they would like to fix the price of gold at $500 an ounce if they could.
[01:03:17.304 --> 01:03:28.467]  So in spite of all their activity to prop the dollar up by affecting the gold price, the market is overwhelming, and they cannot stop the dollar from going down.
[01:03:28.707 --> 01:03:34.428]  The websites are libertycommittee.org, ronpaul2008.com, and many others.
[01:03:34.448 --> 01:03:45.971]  We'll give you those on the other side, and we'll get the Congressman's analysis, and he's an award-winning economic mind himself, on what he thinks we should do, what we could do, to reverse this
[01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:51.828]  Inflationary depression that every top economist we interview shows we're going to enter in the next two years.
[01:03:54.031 --> 01:04:01.937]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.

[01:05:51.051 --> 01:05:52.612]  Join the info war today.
[01:05:53.112 --> 01:05:58.774]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:04.096]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:06:04.376 --> 01:06:09.458]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:13.339]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:21.666]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:06:21.886 --> 01:06:25.429]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:06:25.669 --> 01:06:30.213]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:06:30.493 --> 01:06:31.274]  Do your part!
[01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:33.816]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:40.301]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[01:06:40.601 --> 01:06:46.704]  I was just talking to the congressman during the break and he wanted to make it clear the main website to visit all of the sites that he officially supports
[01:07:10.567 --> 01:07:14.468]  Is RonPaul.org.
[01:07:14.828 --> 01:07:15.789]  Is that right, Congressman?
[01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:16.789]  That is correct.
[01:07:17.189 --> 01:07:18.509]  RonPaul.org.
[01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:20.430]  That's the main gateway site.
[01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:26.812]  He was telling me that he's not officially with the Liberty Committee anymore, so the main place is RonPaul.org.
[01:07:26.892 --> 01:07:28.833]  Okay, we've got 15 minutes with you, Congressman.
[01:07:29.193 --> 01:07:30.453]  I want to move fast here.
[01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:39.036]  Can you first assess what we're entering and how long you think it'll take until or if we're going to get into an inflationary depression?
[01:07:39.496 --> 01:07:39.976]  I have had
[01:07:40.376 --> 01:07:42.537]  You know, I think it depends on how you're looking at it.
[01:07:42.737 --> 01:07:46.198]  I'm sure there are some people who are already in their own personal depression.
[01:07:46.218 --> 01:07:49.960]  You know, if you're losing your house or you've lost your job and you can't pay your bills, it's very depressed.
[01:08:09.871 --> 01:08:17.994]  Overall, I would say that we're in serious recession, and there's stagflation, and that means prices are going up.
[01:08:18.814 --> 01:08:27.338]  And the Fed works on the assumption that you take care of rising prices by giving us a weak economy.
[01:08:27.458 --> 01:08:38.882]  So they raise interest rates like they did a while ago, and they precipitate a recession, then they hope they can keep the recession from being too bad by printing more money, and of course that's the main problem.
[01:08:39.734 --> 01:09:02.160]  The things that we have to do are not acceptable politically because when the market gets out of whack due to Federal Reserve activities of creating too much credit and having artificially low interest rates, what the market is saying is you have to get rid of the bad investment and liquidate the bad investment and get rid of the excessive debt that people can't handle.
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.421]  So everything we're doing now, whether it's the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Congress,
[01:09:07.466 --> 01:09:16.110]  Or even the President trying to give pep talks like, say, well, if the people would just spend money, go further in debt, and buy consumer products, we won't have a recession.
[01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:18.511]  That's just a lot of nonsense.
[01:09:19.652 --> 01:09:25.554]  So, what is necessary is to allow this liquidation, but the Federal Reserve is not going to do that.
[01:09:25.614 --> 01:09:31.757]  They'd have to let the interest rates go to, let the market determine the interest rates, and Congress wouldn't be just printing a lot more money.
[01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:35.152]  And bailing out everybody and sending everybody a check for $600.
[01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:44.180]  And the markets are agreeing with what I'm saying, because no matter what they do, every day or two they come up with a new plan, a new injection of money.
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:48.523]  And no wonder the markets are saying, well, all that's going to do is weaken the dollar.
[01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:50.865]  And weaken dollars means more inflation.
[01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:54.929]  More inflation means people don't have enough money to pay their bills, so they print more money.
[01:09:54.969 --> 01:09:55.690]  So it's a cycle.
[01:09:56.212 --> 01:09:58.233]  So what we need to do is learn monetary policy.
[01:09:58.253 --> 01:10:00.694]  We need to eventually get rid of the Federal Reserve System.
[01:10:01.094 --> 01:10:03.835]  We need to prevent them from monetizing debt.
[01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:10.077]  The fact that they can just take Treasury bills and use that as collateral to print money is awfully foolish.
[01:10:10.658 --> 01:10:13.779]  But it is overwhelming, and I think it's going to get worse as long...
[01:10:14.415 --> 01:10:25.627]  As they prop up a bad system and try to keep all these mistakes in place, that's why we'll move toward a period of time which is going to probably be defined as depression.
[01:10:26.028 --> 01:10:29.732]  So I would not bet against a depression coming here in the next couple of years.
[01:10:30.399 --> 01:10:41.284]  Well, a recession is two quarters of a downward trend in the graph, and a depression is really, what, four quarters of that at the bottom.
[01:10:41.804 --> 01:10:46.966]  Well, every economist I talk to says this is going to go on for two or three years, and they say that it will be a depression.
[01:10:47.286 --> 01:10:48.947]  It's just the media may not call it that.
[01:10:49.904 --> 01:10:53.665]  Yeah, and the other thing is, is the government may not give us the true statistics.
[01:10:53.745 --> 01:10:56.867]  You saw the figure today about the CPI didn't go up.
[01:10:57.187 --> 01:11:00.748]  Losing energy was flat or, you know, flat or went down a little bit.
[01:11:01.028 --> 01:11:02.029]  Nobody believes that.
[01:11:02.329 --> 01:11:08.791]  Can you imagine the government telling us that our food prices aren't going up and the energy prices haven't gone up in the month of February?
[01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:16.074]  Isn't that the big issue, that the government is losing all credibility and that it's a crisis of credibility?
[01:11:17.099 --> 01:11:21.564]  It is to many degrees because that means they lose confidence in the currency.
[01:11:21.605 --> 01:11:23.607]  Sometimes there's a false confidence in a currency.
[01:11:23.667 --> 01:11:31.358]  We've had the benefit of that over the years because we've had a strong economy and a strong military, so we've had this false confidence.
[01:11:31.778 --> 01:11:42.365]  But no, and I think losing confidence in the government is a good, healthy sign, because why should people be confident in the nonsense they hear, in what we do?
[01:11:42.705 --> 01:11:50.090]  So I think it's good that people are questioning and are losing their confidence in just depending on the government to solve every problem.
[01:11:50.851 --> 01:12:07.854]  Shifting gears into the military front, Fox Fallon resigned, he talked to Esquire, said that it was a bad idea to attack Iran, he had openly told foreign media that we didn't want to attack, it was a bad idea, and then the White House basically had him resign.
[01:12:09.094 --> 01:12:12.875]  Where do you see the Iran front?
[01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:15.335]  Are you still worried about a Gulf of Tonkin or something?
[01:12:15.675 --> 01:12:19.476]  Yeah, I sure am, and you know, during that episode with Fallon,
[01:12:20.496 --> 01:12:21.116]  Thank you.
[01:12:35.429 --> 01:12:41.733]  But they never say, well, what about the value of the dollar, or what about the political atmosphere in the Middle East?
[01:12:41.793 --> 01:12:57.781]  I mean, we have our Navy over there, we keep threatening around, and we put sanctions on them, we want to add more sanctions, and then we have this Admiral resigning, which means that he might have known what they were planning, which means
[01:12:58.221 --> 01:13:05.429]  Right now it raises the chances of us doing some silly thing, and very stupid thing, and starting to attack Iran.
[01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:08.312]  Let me be clear on what you're saying.
[01:13:08.372 --> 01:13:18.503]  Are you saying that oil prices going up, dollar plunging this week could be tied, or you believe in some aspect that that's adding to the further move away from the dollar?
[01:13:19.216 --> 01:13:20.696]  Oh yeah, I think it's continuous.
[01:13:20.716 --> 01:13:26.738]  You know, even some of our closest Arab allies over there are talking about it and they're moving in that direction.
[01:13:26.758 --> 01:13:34.600]  It used to be we only speculated that the real reason for the invasion of Iraq was the fact that Saddam Hussein was moving away from the dollar.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.161]  The Iranians admit that they want to move away from the dollar.
[01:13:37.526 --> 01:13:41.188]  But even places like Saudi and Kuwait, they're even talking about it, too.
[01:13:41.648 --> 01:13:43.068]  And I think they're subtly doing it.
[01:13:43.329 --> 01:13:45.249]  I mean, something must be going on there.
[01:13:45.650 --> 01:13:47.190]  Why is the dollar... somebody's selling dollars.
[01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:48.371]  Well, that's my next point.
[01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:51.852]  I mean, no matter what subject I bring up, it goes back to the dollar.
[01:13:52.373 --> 01:13:55.154]  The whole world is going to be sucked into this.
[01:13:55.354 --> 01:14:02.317]  If the economy fully implodes, if the dollar, you know, goes down to zero like Dr. Roberts and many others are saying,
[01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:06.675]  If they're not lucky, and I think they're running out of luck,
[01:14:21.422 --> 01:14:26.705]  It could very well be the worst ever, because we've never been as globalized as we had been before.
[01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:33.128]  There were different countries, and you always had a Swiss franc putting restraint on some people, and then you had a pound and a dollar.
[01:14:34.049 --> 01:14:39.712]  But today, we just have the yen and the euro and the pound and the dollar, and not much else.
[01:14:40.228 --> 01:14:49.833]  So, it is really, truly an integrated economy, which isn't necessarily bad if it were based on free markets and sound money and a gold standard.
[01:14:49.873 --> 01:14:52.234]  Integration and trade would be fine.
[01:14:52.694 --> 01:15:00.638]  But this is brought together on this fiat money system, so the bubble is much, much bigger
[01:15:01.519 --> 01:15:06.507]  So even at the time of the Great Depression in the 30s, we were not globalized like this.
[01:15:06.567 --> 01:15:08.671]  This is a global bubble.
[01:15:08.851 --> 01:15:14.601]  Oh yeah, and I think it's impressed me already how many foreign banks have been holding all those
[01:15:15.543 --> 01:15:23.270]  I think it's a Siamese twin situation where we're all interconnected to such a point that they're afraid to jump ship, but if they don't they're going to die, but if they do they're financially going to die.
[01:15:36.008 --> 01:15:52.400]  I see kind of a schizophrenic policy where they are doing things to shore up the dollar on one hand, but then on the other hand they cut interest rates knowing that that's going to drive it down further, and then Greenspan goes and talks to a big group of Arab oil producers and tells them two weeks ago dump the dollar, and the dollar starts getting dumped.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:56.002]  I mean, why do you think Cheney dumped his dollars a year ago?
[01:15:56.062 --> 01:15:58.404]  Why do you think Greenspan's bad-mouthing the dollar?
[01:15:59.628 --> 01:16:05.075]  Well, you know, they do a lot of talking and sometimes they even do it the other way.
[01:16:05.095 --> 01:16:09.240]  They'll try to talk the dollar up at the same time they're undermining the dollar.
[01:16:09.764 --> 01:16:22.415]  But you have to look at what they do, and every time they inject money, whether it's the Congress or the Fed, it means more dollars are being pumped into the economy, and that has to lower the value of the dollar.
[01:16:22.956 --> 01:16:26.079]  And once that momentum builds, it could go very rapidly.
[01:16:26.319 --> 01:16:33.005]  Well, the point I'm getting at is the CFR a month ago put out a report saying they want to get rid of the dollar, bring in the Amaro, everything you talked about.
[01:16:33.185 --> 01:16:34.006]  Did you see that report?
[01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:41.018]  I didn't see that particular report, but I've heard that type of speculation.
[01:16:41.599 --> 01:16:49.884]  There may be a few that might benefit, but Bear Stearns and other Wall Street firms are having their own little problems, too.
[01:16:50.604 --> 01:16:55.828]  I think sometimes they get to the point where they believe their own lies and think they're invulnerable.
[01:16:56.188 --> 01:16:58.630]  But some of the big companies there may go down, too.
[01:16:59.732 --> 01:17:03.975]  Because I always believed the Fed would bail them out, and the Fed's been doing that ever since 1971.
[01:17:04.175 --> 01:17:08.157]  They've always been able to rescue, you know, the banking system.
[01:17:08.177 --> 01:17:16.122]  You know, in the 90s, the banks had a difficult time, but lower interest rates helped them, and they did it in the year 2000 after the Nasdaq bubble.
[01:17:16.502 --> 01:17:21.885]  They just figured they were going to be able to do it again, but one of these days, which is maybe today, they're not going to be able to bail everybody out.
[01:17:22.385 --> 01:17:25.767]  Congressman, we're almost out of time and I meant to spend more time on this issue.
[01:17:25.787 --> 01:17:29.309]  I might even push the break back a minute or so if you can do that, John.
[01:17:29.969 --> 01:17:33.511]  Congressman, the Ron Paul revolution, we're having the march, it's coming up.
[01:17:34.212 --> 01:17:43.397]  What about issues or fights that go past the campaign with you kind of at the helm of that, say against NAFTA, or what are some of the other issues?
[01:17:43.717 --> 01:17:47.499]  Well, you know, we have the general programs, which I've always worked on.
[01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:53.968]  You know, like monetary policy and tax policy and foreign policy, you know, non-intervention and sound money.
[01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:58.812]  But I think what you're referring to is, can we get something where we can hang our hat on it?
[01:17:59.553 --> 01:18:02.195]  And I think that is a good approach.
[01:18:02.255 --> 01:18:08.520]  I think we should have goals for everybody, and I will be continuing, obviously, in what I've been doing for 30 years.
[01:18:09.503 --> 01:18:18.150]  As soon as the campaign is absolutely over, I'm still going into some of these primary states, and that's what's on my plate right now.
[01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:33.441]  But I think picking certain subjects, whether it's socialized medicine or trade policy, or the North American Union, it's pretty amazing how many people know about it now, and they didn't know about it a year ago.
[01:18:35.475 --> 01:18:44.799]  You know, the other candidates, when we were asked that, they were all still in denial, but the American people are in nearly the denial that the people are up here in Washington.
[01:18:45.059 --> 01:18:48.921]  Well, that was my final question, Congressman.
[01:18:49.739 --> 01:18:51.440]  At least on the issue of the North American Union.
[01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:54.703]  When we have the military of Canada and the U.S.
[01:18:54.823 --> 01:19:10.836]  openly saying that they're going to come into each other's nations during emergencies or insurrection, when you have the documents that just came out last week where SPP met in 2006 in Mexico and said, we've got to keep this secret from the public.
[01:19:11.137 --> 01:19:12.578]  I mean, those are smoking gun.
[01:19:13.218 --> 01:19:15.640]  Can they go on denying all of this?
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:31.989]  I mean, I see you at the helm of millions of people out there taking action, that same spirit we've seen in the campaign, that will be able to defeat the expansion or the re-upping of NAFTA, that will be able to get us out of the SPP.
[01:19:32.729 --> 01:19:36.712]  How long until we see some concrete battle plans and some directives?
[01:19:37.092 --> 01:19:40.434]  I mean, I know the campaign's still going, but, I mean, we need your leadership.
[01:19:41.215 --> 01:19:46.497]  Yeah, well, it'll come whether it's the campaigning or the organization that follows it.
[01:19:47.657 --> 01:19:51.339]  But we have to have as much concrete evidence as possible.
[01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:52.579]  We know what they're doing.
[01:19:52.619 --> 01:19:53.880]  We know what they've been saying.
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:20:01.163]  But we have to get it to the point where we'll force the regular media to cover that.
[01:20:01.483 --> 01:20:07.165]  So that's why we have the advantage of these talk shows like this, as well as the Internet, to get that information out.
[01:20:07.225 --> 01:20:10.326]  And you do know that the major media
[01:20:10.877 --> 01:20:12.236]  I will respond.
[01:20:13.111 --> 01:20:18.994]  You know, too, a real solid issue that gets viewed on the Internet.
[01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:27.739]  So, yes, we have to keep plugging away, and it looks like this North American Union may well be something that we'll really get the exposure it needs.
[01:20:28.139 --> 01:20:30.980]  Congressman, I want to thank you for the amazing campaign you run.
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:35.603]  You're still there in the presidential race to go to the convention and educate people.
[01:20:36.063 --> 01:20:39.324]  And in the future, you are going to be forming an organization, correct?
[01:20:39.505 --> 01:20:39.965]  Absolutely.
[01:20:39.985 --> 01:20:40.885]  We will, and we'll let you know.
[01:20:41.125 --> 01:20:41.425]  Thank you.
[01:20:41.445 --> 01:20:41.746]  Bye-bye.
[01:20:42.848 --> 01:20:44.595]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I'll push that break back.
[01:20:44.615 --> 01:20:46.784]  We'll be right back with a short segment, then a long segment.
[01:20:46.804 --> 01:20:47.186]  Stay with us.
[01:20:54.076 --> 01:20:58.340]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:03.485]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:03.705 --> 01:21:05.046]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:21:05.206 --> 01:21:08.589]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:06.793]  Eric Arthur Blair, commonly known as George Orwell, said the great enemy of clear language is insincerity.

[01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.543]  Alright, we're back live ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:55.563 --> 01:22:58.504]  We just heard Congress from Ron Paul.
[01:22:58.524 --> 01:23:01.386]  Man, 15-20 minutes goes by so quick.
[01:23:15.013 --> 01:23:17.454]  And I have so many questions I want to ask him, so many ideas.
[01:23:18.015 --> 01:23:23.377]  I talked to him off air and he told me some stuff, but I'm not at liberty to get into it because it hadn't been codified yet.
[01:23:24.637 --> 01:23:33.401]  But you are going to see a new national organization that has battle plans, that has organization, that has ideas.
[01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:40.143]  Anybody who gets mad at Ron Paul for running and then losing doesn't have their head screwed on straight.
[01:23:40.544 --> 01:23:41.564]  I know it's frustrating.
[01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:48.515]  But everything to life, to business, to sports, to relationships, is about not giving up.
[01:23:50.556 --> 01:24:05.100]  I mean, there's a lot of other things that go into it, but if you have got a give-up spirit, and you've got the attitude of, you can just punch out at any time, and just get mad at the coach at any time, and run off crying, you're gonna lose!
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:07.081]  It's an absolute guarantee!
[01:24:07.661 --> 01:24:10.542]  But you go commit, and totally focus,
[01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:13.556]  And put your mind on something.
[01:24:15.377 --> 01:24:16.438]  Most of the time, you're going to win.
[01:24:18.259 --> 01:24:20.301]  And the stakes are so high here.
[01:24:20.381 --> 01:24:22.403]  We can't lose this.
[01:24:23.003 --> 01:24:26.586]  These are sick, wicked control freaks that run the global system.
[01:24:26.966 --> 01:24:28.047]  They are in control.
[01:24:28.728 --> 01:24:31.029]  They are incredibly greedy, incredibly wicked.
[01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:32.390]  We must beat them.
[01:24:33.591 --> 01:24:34.932]  We must defeat them.
[01:24:36.674 --> 01:24:39.536]  There is no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[01:24:41.846 --> 01:24:52.411]  I mean, I want you to know, when I get up here and I tell you that there are hundreds of textbooks and government documents saying the family must be eradicated and the family's bad, that those textbooks are real!
[01:24:54.171 --> 01:24:58.713]  And we've had guests on, and we own the textbooks, and we've made films about them, and we've read them here.
[01:24:59.374 --> 01:25:06.077]  When I tell you that Gloria Steinem's CIA, that the women's movement is meant to hurt and enslave women, I mean, I've got the documents.
[01:25:06.897 --> 01:25:09.758]  It's, by the way, in Bloomberg Financial today, for some reason.
[01:25:10.359 --> 01:25:11.339]  This is why I'm mentioning it.
[01:25:12.344 --> 01:25:24.111]  But nine times out of ten, I'll be talking about some book or some document I saw years ago, and I'll be here live on the show, and I'll mention, yeah, well, everybody knows Gloria Steinem's CIA.
[01:25:26.312 --> 01:25:27.292]  By the way, she's proud of it.
[01:25:27.332 --> 01:25:28.113]  She wrote a book about it.
[01:25:32.155 --> 01:25:35.057]  I wrote a talk show host about 18 years ago.
[01:25:35.077 --> 01:25:36.998]  I don't know, I was 17.
[01:25:37.058 --> 01:25:37.798]  How long ago was that?
[01:25:39.039 --> 01:25:40.279]  Yeah, about 18 years ago, 17 years ago.
[01:25:43.328 --> 01:25:47.931]  I remember hearing a talk show host reading out of her book on air that she was CIA.
[01:25:51.134 --> 01:25:51.974]  And then I went home.
[01:25:52.034 --> 01:25:52.795]  I was in high school.
[01:25:54.356 --> 01:25:57.598]  I wouldn't call my mother a modern feminist, but you know, she had the book on the shelf.
[01:25:58.559 --> 01:26:01.241]  And I pulled it off the shelf and I turned to the page and there it was.
[01:26:01.641 --> 01:26:02.602]  That's how I knew.
[01:26:03.022 --> 01:26:04.823]  I knew from Gloria Steinem.
[01:26:07.465 --> 01:26:10.067]  She's proud of herself and proud of what she's done.
[01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:14.831]  The public can hardly talk.
[01:26:15.652 --> 01:26:16.712]  They dress like monkeys.
[01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:18.454]  They act like monkeys.
[01:26:20.355 --> 01:26:22.296]  Everything's degenerating and falling apart.
[01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:24.478]  I mean literally.
[01:26:24.778 --> 01:26:25.459]  Every statistic.
[01:26:25.479 --> 01:26:26.780]  We are falling apart.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:29.341]  We can survive our currency being destroyed.
[01:26:29.562 --> 01:26:32.764]  We can't survive the fact that we've been turned into a bunch of idiots.
[01:26:35.206 --> 01:26:37.627]  And from that pool of idiots they draw our police.
[01:26:38.208 --> 01:26:39.729]  I'm not even particularly against the police.
[01:26:40.382 --> 01:26:43.964]  They're just drawn from a country that aborts 50 million babies.
[01:26:45.285 --> 01:26:46.826]  You're going to have sick stuff going on.
[01:26:48.187 --> 01:26:53.210]  The police are commanded by a sick commissariat of political scum.
[01:26:58.373 --> 01:27:02.155]  Look, I'm going to open the phones up because we've got a big global warming expert professor coming on.
[01:27:03.856 --> 01:27:09.740]  There's also calls to sue Al Gore by the founder of the Weather Channel for fraud.
[01:27:10.467 --> 01:27:11.368]  And he says he's going to do it.
[01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:19.693]  I'm going to take some calls in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:27:20.373 --> 01:27:25.457]  If you didn't know or you didn't tune in here, gold is at $1,010 an ounce.
[01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:32.862]  The dollar went into free fall yesterday to $1.56 against the euro.
[01:27:33.942 --> 01:27:36.264]  They dumped hundreds of billions in to try to buoy it.
[01:27:36.384 --> 01:27:38.145]  It buoyed at one quarter cent.
[01:27:40.498 --> 01:27:41.979]  And then it plunged even more today.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.823]  They're dumping money on it, hand over fist, and you heard Ron Paul, today could be the day.
[01:27:48.384 --> 01:27:49.445]  Next week could be the week.
[01:27:49.805 --> 01:27:51.186]  Next month, next year, I don't know.
[01:27:51.506 --> 01:27:58.491]  But all the forecasters we talk to say, for the next two years, absolute depression.
[01:28:00.673 --> 01:28:02.074]  And they're not going to lay cops off.
[01:28:02.674 --> 01:28:05.416]  It doesn't matter if you don't have a job to pay for that inspection sticker.
[01:28:05.436 --> 01:28:07.798]  It doesn't matter if you don't have a job to pay for that car.
[01:28:08.809 --> 01:28:11.411]  Doesn't matter if you don't have a pay to, you know, a lot of people are still going to have jobs.
[01:28:11.471 --> 01:28:12.893]  They're not going to have money to get to work.
[01:28:13.513 --> 01:28:15.234]  Cops are going to be there taking you to jail.
[01:28:17.616 --> 01:28:23.001]  And God forbid the dog gets out of the gate and you just close your kids in the car and ran five feet to take it.
[01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:25.003]  That old lady's watching you out of her window.
[01:28:25.403 --> 01:28:26.464]  CPS is going to hit you.
[01:28:26.484 --> 01:28:28.065]  And they're going to hit you hard.
[01:28:29.326 --> 01:28:32.269]  You make one wrong step, you're going to prison.
[01:28:32.862 --> 01:28:33.822]  That's the new America.
[01:28:33.842 --> 01:28:36.723]  They're building lots of big, fat prisons for all of us.
[01:28:36.763 --> 01:28:38.044]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.064 --> 01:28:43.325]  Stay with me.
[01:28:44.466 --> 01:28:45.406]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.866 --> 01:28:47.507]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.387 --> 01:28:51.088]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:12.092 --> 01:29:12.793]  We're good to go.
[01:29:31.084 --> 01:29:31.624]  Let's do it!
[01:29:54.096 --> 01:29:55.538]  America needs Ron Paul.
[01:29:55.778 --> 01:29:56.839]  He needs your support.
[01:29:57.059 --> 01:29:58.040]  The time is now.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:02.324]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[01:30:02.664 --> 01:30:06.748]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[01:30:07.088 --> 01:30:13.014]  RonPaulFlags.com produces the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president.

[01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:37.846]  I'm good.
[01:30:54.193 --> 01:30:59.679]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.119 --> 01:31:04.364]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:04.764 --> 01:31:11.632]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.072 --> 01:31:18.779]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.099 --> 01:31:20.701]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:24.185]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:24.465 --> 01:31:26.928]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:31:27.228 --> 01:31:33.975]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:34.395 --> 01:31:37.078]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:31:41.142 --> 01:31:42.943]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:32:15.883 --> 01:32:19.884]  Weather Channel founder Sue Al Gore for Fraud.
[01:32:19.944 --> 01:32:25.425]  Coldest winter in modern history this year globally.
[01:32:25.505 --> 01:32:27.125]  That's all coming up.
[01:32:46.804 --> 01:32:49.305]  We've got a top expert on the climate coming up to join us.
[01:32:49.325 --> 01:32:54.226]  We've got a bunch of financial news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:32:56.347 --> 01:33:05.930]  Bottom line, I don't even completely agree with Ron Paul, but he's being very conservative about what he says about how they have policies that hurt the dollar, but then they talk up the dollar.
[01:33:06.650 --> 01:33:14.673]  That's to keep the general dumbed-down public thinking everything's okay and getting left holding the bag at the end of the Ponzi scheme.
[01:33:17.617 --> 01:33:19.239]  They fool well, though, what they're doing.
[01:33:19.259 --> 01:33:28.447]  You think the Vice President, a year and a half ago, when he dumped a couple million in dollars he owned into Euros, you think he might have known something there, huh?
[01:33:29.428 --> 01:33:32.591]  Think he might be wanting a weak dollar policy?
[01:33:34.052 --> 01:33:37.895]  And by the way, even devaluing the dollar down to almost zero, they can't pay back all these debts.
[01:33:38.776 --> 01:33:39.917]  And they're debts to nobody.
[01:33:41.198 --> 01:33:42.800]  It's all just fiat crud.
[01:33:45.603 --> 01:33:47.604]  And by debts to nobody, it was made out of nothing.
[01:33:47.624 --> 01:33:49.365]  The globalists get all the real assets.
[01:33:50.525 --> 01:33:53.346]  And then you get left holding the bag when all these companies go belly up.
[01:33:53.386 --> 01:33:54.206]  And believe me, they are.
[01:33:55.067 --> 01:33:56.487]  You think Enron was a big deal?
[01:33:56.587 --> 01:33:57.048]  Enron?
[01:33:57.428 --> 01:34:00.309]  We're all going to live in Enron, basically, if this continues.
[01:34:01.129 --> 01:34:03.170]  You know, you heard me say to Ron Paul, well, what's the solution?
[01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:03.950]  How do we get out of this?
[01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:08.652]  And he says, well, that's politically incorrect and that politically isn't going to happen.
[01:34:09.113 --> 01:34:10.393]  So this is all going to unfold.
[01:34:10.613 --> 01:34:11.214]  And that's true.
[01:34:11.594 --> 01:34:13.155]  They're not going to get rid of their Federal Reserve.
[01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:14.415]  They're not going to cut spending.
[01:34:14.555 --> 01:34:16.156]  They're going to give you socialized health care.
[01:34:16.356 --> 01:34:19.878]  They're going to give you more federalized police and more unfunded mandates.
[01:34:20.838 --> 01:34:25.780]  They're going to give you 10, 20 more years in Iraq at a trillion dollars a year.
[01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:28.061]  They're not going to stop.
[01:34:28.402 --> 01:34:29.302]  It's never going to end.
[01:34:30.362 --> 01:34:32.403]  They're doing everything they did before.
[01:34:33.124 --> 01:34:36.306]  It's just going to keep going and going and going and going.
[01:34:36.346 --> 01:34:37.506]  It isn't going to stop.
[01:34:37.646 --> 01:34:38.527]  They're going for broke.
[01:34:40.588 --> 01:34:44.591]  And again, they go from 300,000 cops to a million, two million now and growing.
[01:34:45.051 --> 01:34:49.874]  They're going to still be out there not coming to your house when your car gets stolen or your house gets broken into.
[01:34:51.215 --> 01:34:52.676]  Because that's not what they've been ordered to do.
[01:34:53.137 --> 01:34:55.218]  They personally would like to probably do real police work.
[01:34:55.598 --> 01:35:02.704]  No, they're going to be out there when you're five miles over the speed limit, giving you a ticket, and then looking in your car, and then trying to find something.
[01:35:06.347 --> 01:35:13.172]  They're going to be there risking their lives, hanging their butts out in the middle of traffic, writing tickets, but they're not scared of that because nobody told them to be scared of it.
[01:35:13.532 --> 01:35:16.114]  That's the number one cause of death for a cop who's getting run over in the street.
[01:35:17.444 --> 01:35:24.287]  No, they're going to be all shaking with fear and pulling their gun on you when they walk up to your car half the time.
[01:35:24.307 --> 01:35:29.669]  I was just talking to one of my sales guys here in the office.
[01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:31.310]  Derek.
[01:35:32.171 --> 01:35:32.871]  He gets pulled over.
[01:35:32.911 --> 01:35:34.432]  Lady cop walks up two days ago.
[01:35:35.912 --> 01:35:37.313]  She says, license, registration.
[01:35:37.353 --> 01:35:39.694]  He reaches in his back pocket and she starts going for the gun.
[01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:42.155]  He goes, man, you asked for my wallet.
[01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:44.437]  Again, they're just shaking with fear.
[01:35:45.338 --> 01:35:48.879]  There's guns, there's terrorists, there's... But it's the same psychology.
[01:35:49.359 --> 01:35:51.860]  You know about, what is it, 14 people?
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:52.980]  I looked this up last year.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.321]  I happened to see an article.
[01:35:54.341 --> 01:35:56.201]  14 people died in 2006.
[01:35:56.502 --> 01:35:57.382]  I'm going from memory.
[01:35:58.022 --> 01:35:58.422]  You know what?
[01:35:58.462 --> 01:36:00.283]  I'm not going to just say that.
[01:36:01.043 --> 01:36:02.284]  I'm going to go to Google right now.
[01:36:02.304 --> 01:36:07.005]  And I'm going to type global shark deaths per year.
[01:36:07.065 --> 01:36:08.986]  Let's test and see.
[01:36:09.006 --> 01:36:10.366]  14 shark deaths in 2006.
[01:36:11.107 --> 01:36:11.987]  Let's just say global
[01:36:15.043 --> 01:36:15.904]  Shark attack deaths.
[01:36:15.924 --> 01:36:16.284]  Here we go.
[01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:25.530]  Global shark attack deaths.
[01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:32.034]  Here we go.
[01:36:32.094 --> 01:36:32.794]  And I'm looking it up.
[01:36:32.854 --> 01:36:34.295]  I remember reading like an AP or something.
[01:36:37.077 --> 01:36:43.341]  I'd just been down in Port Aransas and somebody had been bit on the foot by one and then I was looking up that story and then it mentioned, well, there were only 14 deaths last year.
[01:36:44.651 --> 01:36:46.852]  That was 2007, so last year had to be 2006.
[01:36:47.052 --> 01:36:55.596]  In 2000, there were 79 shark attacks reported worldwide, 11 of them fatal.
[01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:59.038]  Ah, 2000 was 11, I just said 14 in 2006.
[01:37:00.058 --> 01:37:02.880]  In 2005 and... I'm just showing you, I don't make stuff up.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.321]  I'm going from memory here.
[01:37:05.301 --> 01:37:11.364]  In 2005-2006, the number dropped from 61 to 62 respectively, but the number of fatalities dropped to only 4 per year.
[01:37:12.973 --> 01:37:19.737]  One of these attacks, the majority occurred in the United States, 53 of the 2000, 40 in 2005, 38 in 2006.
[01:37:23.599 --> 01:37:32.243]  The Florida Museum for Natural History points out that these numbers can be compared with the much higher deaths from other, less feared causes.
[01:37:32.264 --> 01:37:42.089]  2008 attacks, tourists died in Australia bitten by shark while diving near Bahamas and waters of the Bahamas.
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:47.583]  They had tied fish parts of their body to attract predator fish.
[01:37:48.624 --> 01:37:50.545]  Species involved in the incidents.
[01:37:53.708 --> 01:37:56.710]  I remember they said 14 deaths.
[01:37:57.290 --> 01:37:58.812]  Wikipedia doesn't have the deaths for 2006.
[01:37:58.872 --> 01:37:59.372]  Well, 12 deaths in 2000.
[01:37:59.412 --> 01:38:03.015]  The point is, let's say 12 deaths.
[01:38:03.035 --> 01:38:04.456]  12 deaths on average a year from sharks.
[01:38:12.603 --> 01:38:14.224]  But everyone's totally afraid of them.
[01:38:14.244 --> 01:38:16.185]  Most people I know at the beach won't even get in the water.
[01:38:17.386 --> 01:38:18.767]  Everyone runs around in fear.
[01:38:18.827 --> 01:38:23.250]  People buy all this shark repellent when they scuba dive in the Caribbean, or the Mediterranean.
[01:38:25.271 --> 01:38:32.195]  Even when I'm out on a raft a hundred yards from shore, I still have this weird, kind of instinctive fear of being bitten by a shark.
[01:38:32.976 --> 01:38:38.859]  And then a dolphin comes by, and you see their fin, and you kind of get a, ooh, ooh, you know, an adrenaline rush.
[01:38:41.261 --> 01:38:41.401]  Now,
[01:38:44.724 --> 01:38:46.125]  It's the same thing with guns.
[01:38:47.766 --> 01:38:51.810]  Now, cops do get shot every year and do get killed.
[01:38:51.850 --> 01:38:53.011]  I know it's in the hundreds.
[01:38:54.552 --> 01:38:59.115]  But if you look up how many cops die in car wrecks or being hit written tickets, it's in the thousands.
[01:38:59.516 --> 01:39:00.636]  In fact, I'll just pull those numbers up.
[01:39:00.656 --> 01:39:01.597]  Would you like me to right now?
[01:39:02.618 --> 01:39:07.542]  You'll hang your butt out in a highway to write tickets all day
[01:39:09.725 --> 01:39:16.130]  But when my car got stolen, or my business gets broken into, or my house gets broken into, you won't even show up!
[01:39:17.411 --> 01:39:19.573]  See, there isn't real police work going on.
[01:39:19.633 --> 01:39:23.496]  It's all about a woman gets out of her car with her daughter and her friend.
[01:39:23.856 --> 01:39:25.057]  She walks the 10 feet.
[01:39:25.457 --> 01:39:29.100]  She's parked with her flashers on in front of the Walmart.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:30.201]  That's why the cop ran over.
[01:39:30.241 --> 01:39:31.102]  Hey, you can't park there.
[01:39:31.942 --> 01:39:33.363]  To dump $8.30 into the Salvation Army cup.
[01:39:38.317 --> 01:39:44.159]  She's walking back, and they arrest her and try to CPS her kids, and it was a big national scandal, and they finally dropped it.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:57.805]  Now, I already see the reports where they take the kids every day, because the dog gets out of the gate, you forget to lock the front door, you literally run up for 20 seconds, boom, the Nazi neighbor sees that it's over.
[01:39:58.485 --> 01:40:07.169]  Most of the CPS cases I read about is weirdo neighbors see a three or four year old in a locked fence gate behind the house, mama's in the kitchen cooking, watching,
[01:40:10.495 --> 01:40:11.676]  And they CPS your kids.
[01:40:14.518 --> 01:40:17.381]  And the CPS shows up and says your 3 year old was under 10 in the backyard.
[01:40:17.801 --> 01:40:19.022]  We say that's not allowed.
[01:40:19.623 --> 01:40:20.584]  Well, I was watching him.
[01:40:20.944 --> 01:40:22.645]  Well, let me do an inspection of the house.
[01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:24.407]  Oop, dirty dish, your kid's gone.
[01:40:25.748 --> 01:40:28.170]  Especially if you're poor, they know you won't be able to fight them.
[01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:30.272]  If you're middle class, they kind of hang back.
[01:40:30.352 --> 01:40:32.974]  But they're starting to feed on the middle class now.
[01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:37.144]  And there's thousands of these dangers.
[01:40:37.204 --> 01:40:39.386]  They're everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:39.426 --> 01:40:41.548]  They're absolutely everywhere.
[01:40:45.271 --> 01:40:54.760]  Everyone I know, everyone I know, middle class people, who has had a child fall out of a tree or fall out of a jungle gym and break an arm, break a finger,
[01:40:55.729 --> 01:40:56.649]  CPS comes.
[01:40:57.170 --> 01:40:57.710]  It doesn't matter.
[01:40:57.730 --> 01:40:59.350]  You've got a whole park full of witnesses.
[01:40:59.911 --> 01:41:03.032]  Your child goes in there and that doctor is spying on you.
[01:41:03.412 --> 01:41:05.153]  That nurse is spying on you.
[01:41:05.513 --> 01:41:06.833]  They've been told it's the law.
[01:41:06.873 --> 01:41:08.054]  They've got to call CPS.
[01:41:08.474 --> 01:41:13.256]  Even if you've got witnesses, no judge, no jury, no due process, no nothing.
[01:41:14.136 --> 01:41:16.497]  I told the story about my wife a month ago having a baby.
[01:41:17.497 --> 01:41:18.617]  North Austin Medical Center.
[01:41:18.657 --> 01:41:19.378]  Nice facility.
[01:41:19.818 --> 01:41:21.018]  Doctor's a fan of the show.
[01:41:21.839 --> 01:41:22.439]  Two nurses.
[01:41:24.526 --> 01:41:25.006]  We're good to go.
[01:41:43.357 --> 01:41:50.298]  Get in there at 530 a.m., the head nurse is in there saying, I got a questionnaire, maiden name, how much do you weigh, all this stuff in the file.
[01:41:50.738 --> 01:41:53.959]  And I learned years before, that's hooked into the health department, all being filed on you.
[01:41:55.059 --> 01:41:57.420]  It's not even a law, it's just a court regulation.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:04.721]  It's all going right to the inquisitor, it's all like a wiretap, right to the government, right to the CPS, health department.
[01:42:06.061 --> 01:42:07.262]  They don't tell you this, do they?
[01:42:07.562 --> 01:42:08.842]  But I already knew, and I'm watching her.
[01:42:11.336 --> 01:42:13.619]  I know him from past years, and I knew it was coming.
[01:42:13.639 --> 01:42:18.364]  He said, one floor down, will you bring this file to him?
[01:42:19.605 --> 01:42:21.267]  Go take care of this for me.
[01:42:21.487 --> 01:42:23.930]  I saw the predatory look in her eyes.
[01:42:24.010 --> 01:42:26.473]  It's that dominant power trip of the deception.
[01:42:27.535 --> 01:42:28.757]  And that's how evil begins.
[01:42:28.797 --> 01:42:29.858]  It was that little deception.
[01:42:30.219 --> 01:42:31.661]  And I said, sure, I'll be happy.
[01:42:31.681 --> 01:42:34.685]  And winked at my wife and walked out straight ahead.
[01:42:35.005 --> 01:42:35.866]  Does she abuse you?
[01:42:35.906 --> 01:42:36.647]  Does she hit you?
[01:42:36.687 --> 01:42:38.089]  Is your home a safe environment?
[01:42:38.630 --> 01:42:39.671]  Is there plenty of food?
[01:42:40.172 --> 01:42:41.674]  And she's just tapping into the government.
[01:42:44.199 --> 01:42:45.380]  It's like that with everything.
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:46.921]  Your bank's watching you.
[01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:48.701]  Your neighbors are watching you.
[01:42:48.922 --> 01:42:50.382]  Your boss is watching you.
[01:42:50.602 --> 01:42:52.323]  Your employees are watching you.
[01:42:52.623 --> 01:42:54.645]  Just mentally ill tattletales.
[01:42:54.965 --> 01:42:59.567]  We were brought into the social services safety net.
[01:43:00.327 --> 01:43:07.951]  And we were all taught, as citizens, how to tattle, how to spy, how to complain.
[01:43:08.492 --> 01:43:10.813]  And they always make the employer liable.
[01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:18.122]  And then the employers have to enforce, or the hospitals don't get their insurance rating unless they do this, unless they comply.
[01:43:18.503 --> 01:43:22.005]  Then they've got the argument, well, some people come in here and are abused!
[01:43:22.485 --> 01:43:33.193]  And see, it started reasonably 50 years ago with, well, if the lady's teeth are knocked out, she's got black eyes, and the guy's got devil tattoos, walking around going, shut up, you stupid whore!
[01:43:33.733 --> 01:43:34.834]  I'll backhand ya!
[01:43:37.774 --> 01:43:40.736]  Well, even then, I guess you could call the cops and find out if something happened.
[01:43:40.756 --> 01:43:46.441]  But then, statistically, they just CPS your kid to even more dangerous foster parents that beat them and warehouse them.
[01:43:47.201 --> 01:43:47.541]  You see?
[01:43:47.902 --> 01:43:49.443]  Road to Hell's paved with good intentions.
[01:43:49.843 --> 01:43:51.224]  Sounded real reasonable.
[01:43:52.945 --> 01:43:53.446]  To now...
[01:43:55.166 --> 01:43:57.607]  The average woman thinks it's another woman, her friend.
[01:43:57.627 --> 01:43:59.808]  You know, she wants to be near the nurse.
[01:44:00.168 --> 01:44:01.428]  They're about to cut her open.
[01:44:01.808 --> 01:44:03.889]  It's a friendly, quiet time in the morning.
[01:44:04.329 --> 01:44:08.450]  Well, yeah, you know, we've had our share of fights in the past, but we've worked it out now.
[01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:09.251]  Oh, really?
[01:44:10.891 --> 01:44:12.652]  See, luckily, none of that ever happened.
[01:44:12.672 --> 01:44:13.652]  My wife never said that.
[01:44:14.292 --> 01:44:18.033]  But the average family doesn't know why CPS hits them, and hits them hard.
[01:44:19.394 --> 01:44:22.695]  And now that child can be adopted out, and they're going to get about a half million bucks for it.
[01:44:23.405 --> 01:44:28.007]  And most of the time, they go to some nice family, but a lot of times, they get flown out to Saudi Arabia.
[01:44:28.767 --> 01:44:29.807]  Oh, you didn't know that happens?
[01:44:30.168 --> 01:44:30.588]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:32.208 --> 01:44:34.529]  See, that's how it works in the new America.
[01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:38.571]  They're spying on you at all times.
[01:44:39.171 --> 01:44:40.612]  They're watching you at all times.
[01:44:41.652 --> 01:44:45.313]  Now, that doesn't mean you get paranoid and hide under a rock, because they look for that, too.
[01:44:45.353 --> 01:44:51.776]  These chicken-neck, coward, tattletale, little toady, Gestapo enabler types.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.802]  They see you having fear of them, or you being secretive.
[01:44:57.222 --> 01:44:58.743]  That's like blood in the water.
[01:44:59.063 --> 01:45:04.386]  They just get wild at it, and just want to have power over you.
[01:45:04.426 --> 01:45:08.508]  It's how they feed their petty little egos, their little amortent of egos.
[01:45:10.789 --> 01:45:11.890]  So what you do is,
[01:45:15.157 --> 01:45:16.198]  You treat them like children.
[01:45:16.358 --> 01:45:17.339]  You're in charge.
[01:45:17.439 --> 01:45:18.560]  You are the boss.
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:20.701]  You're in control of the situation.
[01:45:21.122 --> 01:45:33.091]  And you just are aware of how they are and you kind of see them like when you're scuba diving and a barracuda comes over, actually statistically for injuries worse than sharks, and you just, you know, you just
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:39.043]  Realize they're a barracuda, a little mindless barracuda, and you just don't stick your fingers in their face, or don't make any sudden moves.
[01:45:39.363 --> 01:45:45.647]  You just talk to them real sweetly, and you have to learn how to even put on a fake act for them, and make them feel important.
[01:45:45.967 --> 01:45:51.030]  You know, pat them on their little shicko head, and just realize how they roll.
[01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:56.253]  Or, you're gonna lose your family.
[01:45:56.273 --> 01:45:57.294]  You're gonna lose your children.
[01:45:58.114 --> 01:45:59.035]  You're gonna go to prison.
[01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:03.370]  You gotta stop drinking and driving, even if it's two beers, you know it's not a problem.
[01:46:03.891 --> 01:46:05.551]  Because they want to put you in the system.
[01:46:06.772 --> 01:46:15.516]  You gotta not argue with your wife or husband, you gotta not fight with each other, because you've been trained how to do that, and the state can't wait for the neighbors to hear you yelling to call the cops to ruin your life.
[01:46:18.437 --> 01:46:21.058]  You can't use their heroin or cocaine, because they ship it in.
[01:46:21.098 --> 01:46:21.999]  There's nothing cool about it.
[01:46:22.039 --> 01:46:23.619]  You can't use their Ritalin or Prozac.
[01:46:23.839 --> 01:46:27.221]  I got stacks of news about kids committing suicide on Ritalin and Prozac today.
[01:46:28.018 --> 01:46:31.221]  I got stacks of news about just everything you can imagine right here in front of me.
[01:46:31.241 --> 01:46:33.863]  And I said I'd take calls.
[01:46:34.443 --> 01:46:36.084]  Charles in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:46:36.124 --> 01:46:36.525]  Go ahead.
[01:46:36.545 --> 01:46:39.567]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:46:39.707 --> 01:46:40.007]  Good, sir.
[01:46:40.027 --> 01:46:40.648]  Good to hear from you.
[01:46:40.928 --> 01:46:42.389]  Well, it's good to hear from you.
[01:46:42.409 --> 01:46:46.212]  Mr. Jones, I want to tell these people something about you.
[01:46:46.813 --> 01:46:49.174]  I've been calling here for eight years.
[01:46:50.155 --> 01:46:52.257]  And they can say what they want about you.
[01:46:53.089 --> 01:46:54.430]  But you see they don't check on nothing.
[01:46:54.650 --> 01:46:57.972]  What they need to do is check on all the water, the chemicals in the water.
[01:46:57.992 --> 01:46:59.633]  It's been in the paper for two years.
[01:47:00.394 --> 01:47:04.536]  Them has got 56 pharmaceutical chemicals in the water.
[01:47:05.477 --> 01:47:09.159]  Men are becoming family because there's so many hormones in the water up here.
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.462]  And they can say anything they want about you.
[01:47:13.302 --> 01:47:15.944]  But the ones that talk about you is the ones that do nothing.
[01:47:16.744 --> 01:47:20.687]  They do nothing for their family, nothing for themselves, nothing for their country.
[01:47:21.485 --> 01:47:22.606]  They won't even spread the word.
[01:47:23.127 --> 01:47:26.810]  But when the time comes, you're going to have the pleasure of seeing them suffer.
[01:47:27.410 --> 01:47:28.451]  Because that's what you're doing.
[01:47:28.471 --> 01:47:32.054]  You're suffering for the generation that are not worthy.
[01:47:32.314 --> 01:47:34.556]  These people are not even worthy for you to be on the air.
[01:47:34.816 --> 01:47:37.238]  And I hate to say that, but it's the gospel's truth.
[01:47:37.679 --> 01:47:39.000]  I did the same thing you did.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:43.863]  All my life, trying to fight for these people, these zombies.
[01:47:44.523 --> 01:47:45.944]  But they don't care until it hits them.
[01:47:46.385 --> 01:47:49.066]  But look, in DC, they're getting ready to take the guns.
[01:47:49.106 --> 01:47:50.367]  They've got a bill to take the guns.
[01:47:50.427 --> 01:47:51.188]  I guess you heard about that.
[01:47:52.142 --> 01:47:53.123]  Yeah, tell folks about it.
[01:48:11.744 --> 01:48:13.145]  But they're drinking the water now.
[01:48:13.445 --> 01:48:14.525]  Everything's contaminated.
[01:48:14.805 --> 01:48:16.026]  Our food's contaminated.
[01:48:16.526 --> 01:48:17.806]  The vegetables are contaminated.
[01:48:17.826 --> 01:48:18.967]  The air's contaminated.
[01:48:19.327 --> 01:48:21.608]  And they want to say that what you say is not true.
[01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:23.048]  These people are sadists.
[01:48:23.508 --> 01:48:24.789]  We don't need these people.
[01:48:25.389 --> 01:48:26.509]  Don't let them worry you.
[01:48:27.230 --> 01:48:30.511]  We don't need the master people no more because the master people are idiots.
[01:48:31.298 --> 01:48:32.858]  You need only a children's few.
[01:48:33.178 --> 01:48:35.659]  The ones that know you, know that you tell the truth.
[01:48:35.999 --> 01:48:37.359]  That's the most important ones.
[01:48:37.599 --> 01:48:42.220]  You're not talking to these idiots out here, because I've been up for eight years, and I wish that you was wrong.
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.981]  I wish that you were wrong.
[01:48:44.281 --> 01:48:45.861]  I can go to sleep at night, Mr. Jones.
[01:48:45.881 --> 01:48:47.261]  I hate to say that, but I wish you was.
[01:48:47.281 --> 01:48:48.662]  Do you understand?
[01:48:48.962 --> 01:48:50.662]  Oh, I wish I was wrong too.
[01:48:51.062 --> 01:48:51.582]  The tapes.
[01:48:52.182 --> 01:48:55.243]  I'd like to know, and I know you get tired of me talking about the tapes.
[01:48:56.328 --> 01:48:59.531]  But, how many people has seen all your tapes?
[01:48:59.551 --> 01:49:01.492]  How many people has passed it out to their family?
[01:49:01.512 --> 01:49:02.233]  Just their family?
[01:49:02.593 --> 01:49:04.374]  Probably a very little percentage.
[01:49:04.935 --> 01:49:07.357]  And that's all they need to do is get a tape, and they can prove you wrong.
[01:49:07.617 --> 01:49:08.938]  And I'm not trying to hustle tapes.
[01:49:09.178 --> 01:49:10.479]  I'm not trying to sell you tapes.
[01:49:10.659 --> 01:49:13.801]  I'm trying to save their country, and I'm trying to save them.
[01:49:14.462 --> 01:49:17.544]  You see, but you know, you worry about what they say.
[01:49:17.864 --> 01:49:20.366]  These people that's talking against you, they haven't done nothing.
[01:49:20.386 --> 01:49:23.108]  You've been in the AFL, I know, for over eight years.
[01:49:23.568 --> 01:49:24.089]  Listen to you.
[01:49:25.060 --> 01:49:27.701]  Yeah, I've been on the air since 1995.
[01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:28.281]  Well, 1985.
[01:49:28.341 --> 01:49:31.022]  Okay, I started here in 1999.
[01:49:32.022 --> 01:49:35.363]  But the water, the water's another problem.
[01:49:35.823 --> 01:49:39.444]  They're gonna release more stuff in the water in July, I found out.
[01:49:40.084 --> 01:49:41.044]  We get more chemicals.
[01:49:41.104 --> 01:49:42.704]  People are dumb on this water.
[01:49:43.485 --> 01:49:45.765]  They get their kids took away, you try to fight for their kids.
[01:49:45.785 --> 01:49:48.006]  They don't even fight for their own kids.
[01:49:48.026 --> 01:49:49.286]  You gotta fight for them.
[01:49:49.306 --> 01:49:50.626]  Charles, we love you.
[01:49:50.646 --> 01:49:51.567]  Keep it up, my brother.
[01:49:51.587 --> 01:49:52.627]  Be right back.

[01:54:08.642 --> 01:54:09.262]  LiveFreeNow.org.
[01:54:09.362 --> 01:54:11.363]  William Rodriguez, Larry Becraft,
[01:54:20.968 --> 01:54:25.149]  Tommy Cryer, Joe Bannister, G. Edward Griffin, so many others.
[01:54:25.469 --> 01:54:26.589]  Just go check out their website.
[01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:29.050]  It really is an amazing professional conference.
[01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:29.890]  You'll learn so much.
[01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:31.691]  LiveFreeNow.org.
[01:54:31.751 --> 01:54:33.511]  Three days in Irvine, California.
[01:54:33.531 --> 01:54:34.591]  March 28th, 31st.
[01:54:34.611 --> 01:54:37.852]  760-868-4271.
[01:54:38.612 --> 01:54:39.973]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:41.553]  David in Texas.
[01:54:41.573 --> 01:54:42.113]  You're on the air.
[01:54:42.153 --> 01:54:42.733]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:43.114 --> 01:54:43.614]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:43.914 --> 01:54:44.714]  I like your show.
[01:54:45.803 --> 01:54:49.225]  Yeah, I know the caller mentioned the gun confiscation or the gun laws.
[01:54:49.265 --> 01:54:50.947]  That's one great thing about being in Texas.
[01:54:51.007 --> 01:54:54.250]  I think they'd have a real problem if they tried to confiscate guns down here.
[01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:58.093]  The Lakota situation, a couple questions on that.
[01:54:58.493 --> 01:55:00.335]  Do you think that could turn ugly?
[01:55:00.815 --> 01:55:02.797]  Waco example kind of thing?
[01:55:02.817 --> 01:55:06.280]  Do you think that's going to escalate into something more?
[01:55:06.580 --> 01:55:07.741]  And one last question.
[01:55:08.624 --> 01:55:11.908]  I got zapped by one of those and I thought they'd been taken out for some reason.
[01:55:11.928 --> 01:55:13.310]  I guess I missed one of your shows.
[01:55:13.791 --> 01:55:18.217]  I got zapped by one of those intersection cameras.
[01:55:18.277 --> 01:55:23.424]  I saw two big old white flashes of light go off last night and the light had just turned yellow and I was right in the middle of the intersection.
[01:55:23.444 --> 01:55:24.886]  No, no, we've been spotting them for years.
[01:55:24.906 --> 01:55:25.747]  They put them everywhere.
[01:55:26.187 --> 01:55:30.010]  Okay, I got zapped by one of those and I need your advice if you can give it to me.
[01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:31.151]  Is that something I fight?
[01:55:31.251 --> 01:55:33.613]  Do I say prove I was the driver of the vehicle?
[01:55:33.633 --> 01:55:34.113]  Well, no, no.
[01:55:34.293 --> 01:55:37.295]  You need to fight it in the same way they threw it out in San Diego.
[01:55:38.556 --> 01:55:40.818]  It has to be an officer giving you a citation.
[01:55:40.878 --> 01:55:45.441]  It can't be a private company and a computer doing it and you need to fight it.
[01:55:45.982 --> 01:55:46.262]  Okay.
[01:55:46.969 --> 01:55:48.410]  If you say it, I'll do it.
[01:55:48.470 --> 01:55:52.011]  So I'll basically just show up in court and just tell them exactly what you just said.
[01:55:52.051 --> 01:56:00.675]  Just say, you know, this was not like what you were talking about with the schools where they give you the piece of paper and make you sign it, but there wasn't an actual officer giving you the citation.
[01:56:00.715 --> 01:56:08.879]  I did hear... Yeah, you've got to actually pull the actual case up, but the larger issue is Lockheed Martin was in San Diego and had to remove him.
[01:56:09.565 --> 01:56:16.652]  The bigger issue here is they've been caught in Chicago and in San Diego and other places shortening the yellow lights.
[01:56:17.347 --> 01:56:21.170]  So you also get the city records of did they shorten that light?
[01:56:21.190 --> 01:56:21.730]  And they do!
[01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:24.713]  When you're driving 50, suddenly it flashes all the time.
[01:56:24.793 --> 01:56:26.114]  I brake for a yellow light.
[01:56:26.574 --> 01:56:28.175]  I'm not going to be able to stop in time.
[01:56:28.455 --> 01:56:31.318]  So I go ahead and go through and right as I go under it, it might turn red.
[01:56:31.378 --> 01:56:32.358]  I don't run them on purpose.
[01:56:32.679 --> 01:56:33.759]  They still give you tickets.
[01:56:33.799 --> 01:56:34.340]  They shouldn't.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:38.403]  So then you sue them for endangerment for shortening that light.
[01:56:38.463 --> 01:56:42.346]  I guarantee you those greedy criminals at the City of Austin, you're in the filth city, right?
[01:56:42.646 --> 01:56:43.747]  I'm in San Antonio.
[01:56:43.827 --> 01:56:45.788]  Okay, well, another city of wicked filth.
[01:56:46.128 --> 01:56:46.589]  Right.
[01:56:46.649 --> 01:56:47.750]  Run by total criminals.
[01:56:48.490 --> 01:56:52.193]  Yeah, you just need to... Yeah, and of course the citizens did fight it and beat it.
[01:56:52.233 --> 01:56:52.813]  They don't care.
[01:56:53.033 --> 01:56:53.954]  They're hardcore crooks.
[01:56:54.714 --> 01:56:56.315]  And they're killing people.
[01:56:56.335 --> 01:57:00.478]  They were caught killing people in Chicago and San Diego, shortening those yellow lights.
[01:57:00.718 --> 01:57:03.120]  So you're saying I need to get the public records on that?
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:07.043]  Yes, you need to get the public records on the light maintenance.
[01:57:07.083 --> 01:57:08.924]  Don't tell them what they're doing or they'll fix them.
[01:57:09.364 --> 01:57:09.965]  They're criminals!
[01:57:09.985 --> 01:57:12.727]  Remember, hardcore crooks run almost the entire government.
[01:57:12.947 --> 01:57:14.528]  Criminality now is just normal.
[01:57:15.569 --> 01:57:16.290]  Or they'll fix them.
[01:57:16.330 --> 01:57:24.256]  Just say you want the light synchronization, or you want the records on the maintenance of that light, and then you'll be able to find out when they shortened it.
[01:57:24.276 --> 01:57:27.218]  It was probably a four second light, they'd probably make it two or three.
[01:57:27.719 --> 01:57:29.320]  Part of their hardcore commie actions.
[01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:30.221]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:36.773]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:36.854 --> 01:57:39.459]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.678 --> 01:57:54.882]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.523 --> 01:57:56.343]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.104 --> 01:57:57.985]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.666 --> 01:58:02.309]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.849 --> 01:58:06.933]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:21.417 --> 01:58:23.177]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[01:58:23.238 --> 01:58:24.258]  Gammon here, phone calls.
[01:58:24.298 --> 01:58:28.879]  Got a climate expert coming in who's debunking all the propaganda about global warming.
[01:58:28.979 --> 01:58:32.200]  Then I've got a new confrontation with Larry Silverstein by We Are Change.
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.061]  And another We Are Change confrontation with Bill Clinton.
[01:58:35.841 --> 01:58:37.261]  We Are Change is on fire.
[01:58:37.321 --> 01:58:40.282]  That's why you notice some 9-11 truth groups have been bad-mouthing them.
[01:58:41.302 --> 01:58:43.343]  And I can't believe We Are Change has even responded.
[01:58:43.483 --> 01:58:44.203]  Who cares?
[01:58:45.443 --> 01:58:48.304]  When a bunch of jealous do-nothings attack you, you ought to be happy.
[01:58:49.532 --> 01:58:55.557]  They're too aggressive, they're too... Joe in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:58:55.577 --> 01:58:56.538]  Hey Alex.
[01:58:56.958 --> 01:58:57.439]  Hi.
[01:58:57.919 --> 01:58:58.860]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:09.389]  Listen, I originally called, I wanted to ask a question, but I was watching, my first point, I was watching that Bush conference in New York.
[01:59:09.689 --> 01:59:11.270]  Telling us how great the economy is?
[01:59:11.490 --> 01:59:13.972]  I gotta tell you, my jaw almost hit the floor.
[01:59:14.533 --> 01:59:18.316]  He had prepared statements that he made, of course, and then he took two questions.
[01:59:18.823 --> 01:59:28.251]  And the second question he took, it was a two-part question, and the second part of the question was about high oil, falling dollar, high food prices.
[01:59:29.172 --> 01:59:38.479]  And when he started to give an answer, the President started to answer the question, and he was saying that, oh, there's a short supply of oil and all this other stuff.
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:46.105]  And he went about to answer the question in a roundabout way, and the second part he actually said, I couldn't believe it.
[01:59:47.324 --> 01:59:47.644]  I don't know.
[02:00:04.471 --> 02:00:09.993]  of the President of the United States to tell these people, the business people, that he was going to dodge the question.
[02:00:10.213 --> 02:00:13.234]  Yeah, he won't even give them a hem-haw politician answer.
[02:00:13.774 --> 02:00:15.575]  It's just, hey, I'm not even going to answer that.
[02:00:15.995 --> 02:00:19.856]  It was incredible, but I just wanted to get that out.
[02:00:21.737 --> 02:00:27.319]  The second thing I wanted to know was, again, I was listening to you earlier, and I don't want you to do my homework.
[02:00:27.359 --> 02:00:28.239]  I try real hard.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:33.341]  I've been looking for the pamphlet that they're giving out to the police now.
[02:00:33.857 --> 02:00:42.640]  Where they say, look for people who talk about the Constitution, people who talk about the Bill of Rights, they're potential terrorists.
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:44.400]  I can't find that anywhere.
[02:00:46.201 --> 02:00:53.323]  It's on Infowars.com, it's on PrisonPlanet.com, it's on my Road to Tyranny website.
[02:00:53.543 --> 02:00:54.403]  I'm trying to find it.
[02:00:54.443 --> 02:00:55.463]  I mean, it's in the film.
[02:00:56.424 --> 02:01:00.425]  I saw it in the film, I just can't find it, because what I'd like to do is print it out
[02:01:01.158 --> 02:01:03.579]  Those staples are on telephone poles in my town.
[02:01:03.719 --> 02:01:07.581]  I think there was a Washington Times article about it, too, called Constitutional Terrorist.
[02:01:08.321 --> 02:01:10.102]  Let me Google it for you right now.
[02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:10.642]  Here we go.
[02:01:11.282 --> 02:01:12.423]  Constitutional terrorist.
[02:01:13.023 --> 02:01:16.445]  And while you're looking, I didn't know if you heard about this or not.
[02:01:17.365 --> 02:01:21.347]  Are you aware that France is coming out with a flying taser?
[02:01:23.221 --> 02:01:27.603]  Yeah, that was in Reuters two months ago and I reported on it and people said I was lying.
[02:01:27.923 --> 02:01:29.584]  Oh yeah, well all they've got to do is look it up.
[02:01:29.644 --> 02:01:30.705]  I couldn't believe that either.
[02:01:30.725 --> 02:01:32.886]  No, that was in Reuters and AFP.
[02:01:33.266 --> 02:01:37.968]  It's a flying saucer that fires rocket-propelled tasers.
[02:01:38.248 --> 02:01:38.708]  Yup, yup.
[02:01:38.788 --> 02:01:41.050]  And I think it's like, it doesn't matter.
[02:01:41.070 --> 02:01:42.271]  They just fire them into the crowd.
[02:01:42.291 --> 02:01:46.233]  Sir, the yuppies, when they're attacking them, will say they don't exist.
[02:01:46.253 --> 02:01:46.734]  You understand?
[02:01:47.134 --> 02:01:48.055]  Oh yeah.
[02:01:48.375 --> 02:01:51.377]  And it's about submission to being a groveling, pathetic worm.
[02:01:51.597 --> 02:01:52.758]  It's about being dumb.
[02:01:52.978 --> 02:01:54.159]  It's about being conned.
[02:01:54.359 --> 02:01:55.500]  It's about being wrong.
[02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:56.881]  It's about being stupid.
[02:01:57.081 --> 02:01:58.242]  It's about being idiots.
[02:01:58.522 --> 02:01:59.162]  They want it.
[02:01:59.202 --> 02:01:59.843]  They're going to get it.
[02:02:00.743 --> 02:02:07.488]  Well, one person, a very dear friend of mine today, I was talking to her about all this stuff and she says, you know,
[02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:12.773]  He says, you know, Joe, she goes, I know you believe this and all this stuff, but I really don't want to hear it.
[02:02:13.054 --> 02:02:16.835]  She says, you know, I just want to watch NCIS and all this other stuff.
[02:02:17.036 --> 02:02:20.417]  Well, it's the ultimate selfishness to not even save yourself.
[02:02:20.737 --> 02:02:21.498]  It's mental illness.
[02:02:21.538 --> 02:02:22.338]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:02:23.079 --> 02:02:25.940]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there and you can finish it up after the guest if you want or whatever.
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:31.063]  But the point is, it's the ultimate selfishness to say, I choose not to believe that.
[02:02:31.843 --> 02:02:36.025]  I know you believe that, Joe, but I choose not to.
[02:02:36.145 --> 02:02:37.326]  So it doesn't exist.
[02:02:38.104 --> 02:02:39.304]  Again, they're little children.
[02:02:39.344 --> 02:02:45.166]  They think if they say it doesn't exist, like kick-a-boo, then it makes it go bye-bye.
[02:02:46.526 --> 02:02:48.226]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:02:48.527 --> 02:02:52.047]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:02:52.147 --> 02:02:54.028]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:02:54.048 --> 02:02:57.369]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:02:57.689 --> 02:03:03.170]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:03:03.450 --> 02:03:07.411]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:03:07.731 --> 02:03:12.673]  In the Infowar, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:03:12.953 --> 02:03:15.733]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:03:47.765 --> 02:03:48.265]  Alright, Dad.
[02:03:48.505 --> 02:03:49.506]  Let me get this straight.
[02:03:49.806 --> 02:03:51.848]  I'm supposed to believe this takes place in the future, right?
[02:03:51.968 --> 02:03:52.828]  Like Star Wars?
[02:03:52.988 --> 02:03:53.629]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:03:53.809 --> 02:03:54.809]  Slightly in the future.
[02:03:55.009 --> 02:03:55.810]  Wait a second.
[02:03:56.090 --> 02:03:59.192]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[02:03:59.332 --> 02:04:00.273]  Alright, Einstein.
[02:04:00.413 --> 02:04:02.434]  But it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[02:04:02.594 --> 02:04:09.258]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[02:04:09.498 --> 02:04:10.779]  Okay, so don't tell me.
[02:04:11.099 --> 02:04:12.680]  The government's the bad guy again?
[02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:13.641]  Yep, that's right.
[02:04:13.921 --> 02:04:16.302]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[02:04:16.622 --> 02:04:17.363]  Not exactly.
[02:04:17.663 --> 02:04:18.103]  I know!
[02:04:18.483 --> 02:04:19.704]  You're Chewbacca!
[02:04:19.784 --> 02:04:28.627]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[02:04:28.847 --> 02:04:30.488]  Wait a second, they can't track us!
[02:04:30.548 --> 02:04:31.468]  It's a free country!
[02:04:32.009 --> 02:04:32.729]  Exactly.
[02:04:33.549 --> 02:04:37.211]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[02:04:47.009 --> 02:04:52.913]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[02:04:53.013 --> 02:05:04.461]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[02:05:04.881 --> 02:05:05.722]  Here's the story.
[02:05:06.022 --> 02:05:13.891]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[02:05:14.212 --> 02:05:15.273]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:15.353 --> 02:05:16.654]  It's 100% legal.
[02:05:17.055 --> 02:05:23.122]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[02:05:23.462 --> 02:05:25.603]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:05:49.592 --> 02:05:51.013]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:51.373 --> 02:05:53.734]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.094 --> 02:06:15.764]  I've got several mainstream news articles here in front of me where the big consortium of central banks have gotten together publicly saying, we must have these new global taxes, we must stop
[02:06:16.827 --> 02:06:18.068]  The Global Warming!
[02:06:18.128 --> 02:06:19.608]  We must save the Earth!
[02:06:19.688 --> 02:06:21.149]  It must happen now!
[02:06:22.849 --> 02:06:27.991]  And then you go back to the IMF and World Bank documents, you go back to the Club of Rome documents, they state!
[02:06:29.032 --> 02:06:38.295]  In fact, just on Monday, I was reading Richard N. Haas, the President of the Council on Foreign Relations, and the big business roundtable group here in the U.S.
[02:06:38.335 --> 02:06:45.398]  saying, it's a fake front, we need to say Global Warming is a unifying effect, organize the people around it,
[02:06:46.013 --> 02:06:47.394]  And that the real threat is humanity.
[02:06:48.535 --> 02:06:51.316]  This is their way of taxing and regulating and controlling your life.
[02:06:51.336 --> 02:06:55.899]  The entire solar system is heating up.
[02:06:55.959 --> 02:07:06.525]  When I had the Air to the Rothschild Dynasty on during Live Earth last year, it's in my film Endgame, I said, well, why are Jupiter and Saturn and their moons heating up?
[02:07:06.545 --> 02:07:08.386]  And he said, because they're closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[02:07:09.087 --> 02:07:09.947]  And I said, no, they're not.
[02:07:09.967 --> 02:07:10.928]  And he said, yes, they are.
[02:07:11.028 --> 02:07:14.430]  And people emailed me and said that I was wrong and that the Earth is
[02:07:15.174 --> 02:07:18.296]  Further away from the Sun and Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus.
[02:07:18.816 --> 02:07:25.601]  Folks, the public, literally, I mean, I'm not even smart, but the people that follow this stuff are like cult members.
[02:07:26.381 --> 02:07:28.522]  I mean, they just do not care.
[02:07:29.623 --> 02:07:34.046]  And so what they do is they want to tax inert gases like carbon dioxide that's life-giving.
[02:07:35.806 --> 02:07:36.947]  And things like ozone.
[02:07:37.288 --> 02:07:41.111]  But they don't ever want to stop coal plants in Texas burning mercury coal.
[02:07:41.431 --> 02:07:42.212]  Very dirty coal.
[02:07:42.532 --> 02:07:45.495]  Oh no, something that actually might hurt you, we're not going to do anything about.
[02:07:45.755 --> 02:07:47.577]  See, because the big corporations run all this.
[02:07:47.777 --> 02:07:51.300]  And we are honored to be joined by
[02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:59.672]  Retired physics professor, 30 plus years at the University of Connecticut, and he's a top physicist.
[02:07:59.712 --> 02:08:01.313]  I was reading over his bio here.
[02:08:01.333 --> 02:08:06.955]  I've got one of the shorter bios here, but I'm not going to read the whole thing because we don't have time.
[02:08:07.175 --> 02:08:15.579]  He could tell you more about himself, but he has also published quite a few books, and a few of them pertain to the whole global warming
[02:08:16.363 --> 02:08:19.626]  Folks that we're facing and that we're here looking at.
[02:08:20.106 --> 02:08:24.970]  And so I am very honored to have Howard C. Hayden on with us.
[02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.651]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:08:26.472 --> 02:08:27.192]  You're very welcome.
[02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:34.118]  Let me just ask you as a physics professor, is the Earth closer to the Sun than Jupiter?
[02:08:34.879 --> 02:08:35.619]  Absolutely.
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:39.643]  Jupiter is 5.2 times as far from the Sun as the Earth is.
[02:08:41.761 --> 02:08:45.762]  Well, I think they just ought to look it up in any astronomy book that they can find.
[02:08:45.782 --> 02:08:46.822]  I mean, for gosh sakes, that's been known since...
[02:09:01.856 --> 02:09:03.377]  Oh, hundreds of years.
[02:09:03.917 --> 02:09:06.138]  So, uh, what are they talking about?
[02:09:06.678 --> 02:09:12.321]  Well, by the way, sir, I'm not even, you know, this sounds like satire, and a little bit of it is, but it's not real satire.
[02:09:12.701 --> 02:09:15.563]  You know, one-fifth of Americans in major studies can't find the U.S.
[02:09:15.623 --> 02:09:16.063]  on a map.
[02:09:16.583 --> 02:09:19.164]  Eighty percent of high school graduates don't know who the vice president is.
[02:09:19.585 --> 02:09:24.607]  I think they're getting away with this hoax because the public literally is in la-la land.
[02:09:26.372 --> 02:09:31.033]  Well, I think they are, and there are a couple things that are driving the hoax.
[02:09:31.193 --> 02:09:45.838]  One of them is that there are some scientists, and they are not, I repeat, not the majority, who are committed to the idea that global warming, A, is happening, and B, that we are responsible.
[02:09:46.898 --> 02:09:54.360]  There are some, and the media have turned it into quite a frenzy, but there is also a huge amount of
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:59.144]  Money driving this scenario.
[02:10:00.105 --> 02:10:08.113]  For example, I saw a huge billboard at Times Square last week that was advertising Gloom and Doom.
[02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:13.658]  It showed London under ocean waves in 2092 and it showed, let's see,
[02:10:19.591 --> 02:10:20.391]  What the heck was it?
[02:10:21.332 --> 02:10:29.015]  Beijing under desert dunes in a matter of, oh, I don't know, 30, 40 years, something like that.
[02:10:29.836 --> 02:10:40.841]  And so I inquired what those billboards cost to run, and I don't have anything official on it yet, but it's somewhere around $700,000 a month.
[02:10:41.581 --> 02:10:46.063]  So where exactly is the money coming from that's advertising this?
[02:10:47.197 --> 02:10:58.847]  And my own presumption is, but I don't have any proof yet, but it's people who intend to cash in on the carbon credit trading.
[02:11:00.448 --> 02:11:12.638]  This was a scam that was started by Enron, and though Enron went under because of its own internal malice, let's call it, the scam lives on.
[02:11:14.938 --> 02:11:25.584]  So we have that going on, and there are people that stand to earn a tremendous amount of money by doing nothing more than buying and selling carbon credits.
[02:11:30.586 --> 02:11:32.548]  Well, take a look at that first word in cap and trade.
[02:11:32.568 --> 02:11:32.749]  It's cap.
[02:11:52.225 --> 02:12:08.180]  Now, what Supreme Soviet decides exactly how much CO2 you or I or some given company or some given corporation or some given country is allowed to emit.
[02:12:09.401 --> 02:12:18.449]  And therein lies, let's say, a lot of control, to put it mildly.
[02:12:20.327 --> 02:12:29.592]  Well, I've seen two mainstream news articles this week where the big consortium of banks are coming out saying, save the earth, we're all dead, give us this new global tax, and they now admit.
[02:12:30.292 --> 02:12:37.996]  Now, we got the SPP documents from the Security and Prosperity Partnership, and they said, well, they want a North American taxing grid.
[02:12:38.856 --> 02:12:40.517]  They want to tax each car, the
[02:12:43.101 --> 02:12:51.005]  Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported last week the government wants to put a transponder in every car in Texas, and if you complain, well, it's for the Earth!
[02:12:51.965 --> 02:12:53.646]  Yeah, oh, and the children.
[02:12:53.706 --> 02:12:54.666]  Don't forget the children.
[02:12:55.446 --> 02:12:56.587]  Exactly.
[02:12:57.547 --> 02:12:58.368]  It's for the children.
[02:13:00.089 --> 02:13:09.853]  Just from the perspective of the books you've written on this, as a physicist, in layman's terms, for people to understand, why is their claim of man-made global warming a hoax?
[02:13:11.101 --> 02:13:27.481]  Well, it boils down to nothing more than a simple correlation, and that is that the Earth has been warming up and CO2 emissions have been going up, and people see that there is some kind of a link between the two.
[02:13:29.694 --> 02:13:43.077]  And indeed, you have to go back about a century, about a century ago, a guy named Arrhenius had figured out that additional CO2 would cause some heating of the Earth.
[02:13:43.677 --> 02:13:57.399]  Now it turned out that all his numbers were wrong, but the principle remains that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but it is a minor greenhouse gas that lies way behind water vapor.
[02:13:58.735 --> 02:13:59.136]  We're good.
[02:14:15.092 --> 02:14:29.044]  Every year that is put up there by humans, because we burn coal, we burn oil, we burn natural gas, all that CO2 we put into the air is no more than about 3% of the CO2 that goes into the air.
[02:14:30.665 --> 02:14:34.649]  And the other 97% comes from totally natural sources.
[02:14:35.349 --> 02:14:37.531]  Humans, plankton, animals?
[02:14:38.632 --> 02:14:39.613]  Primarily the ocean.
[02:14:41.226 --> 02:14:44.307]  The warm ocean is an emitter of CO2.
[02:14:44.447 --> 02:14:46.408]  Cold oceans are an absorber.
[02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:59.453]  And historically, when the oceans have warmed up because of, let's say, orbital and solar effects, when the Earth
[02:15:00.313 --> 02:15:10.820]  Those have caused the Earth to warm up, the oceans have subsequently warmed up, and then the CO2 has followed suit and increased in the atmosphere.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:21.708]  Well, I mean, Al Gore in his film, Earth on the Balance, or Inconvenient Truth, his book and the film, he shows the graph, but he lies and puts the CO2 in red.
[02:15:23.690 --> 02:15:43.822]  Underneath the green for the warming trend, but in all the studies from all the universities and different sciences and different divisions, it all shows the same data that about 600 years after heating, you then get carbon dioxide increasing, not carbon dioxide goes up and then heat goes up.
[02:15:44.002 --> 02:15:44.903]  Is that a correct statement?
[02:15:45.924 --> 02:16:10.440]  You are correct, but there was another time lag, and that is because the data that everybody refers to were taken at Vostok, which is fairly deep inland in Antarctica, where it is really very cold and they pull up ice cores, but the data points in that graph were about a thousand years apart.
[02:16:11.466 --> 02:16:32.880]  And it took more, you know, later research to sort of correlate things deep in Antarctica with things nearer the shore where the snow piles up faster and you have higher resolution to determine that really the CO2 did come after the temperature changes.
[02:16:33.861 --> 02:16:39.264]  So that, let's say 30, 40 years ago, it was quite reasonable to assume
[02:16:41.204 --> 02:16:41.785]  I think so.
[02:16:57.595 --> 02:16:58.275]  How do they get that?
[02:16:58.315 --> 02:16:59.436]  Is it a spectrometer?
[02:16:59.736 --> 02:17:03.737]  Or how are they getting that data out of the ice?
[02:17:04.458 --> 02:17:09.140]  Well, you drill a core, which people do in the ice.
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:11.681]  They do the same thing when they do mining.
[02:17:11.901 --> 02:17:17.123]  Sure, I understand pulling up the plug, but I mean, what tools are they using to get that data?
[02:17:17.643 --> 02:17:25.186]  Okay, well the first thing they do is they take part of this long cylinder of ice and they slice it into a
[02:17:25.766 --> 02:17:27.566]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:27.586 --> 02:17:28.367]  A new world order.
[02:17:28.547 --> 02:17:29.727]  In the near future.
[02:17:29.747 --> 02:17:31.187]  Earth is dominated by it.
[02:17:56.497 --> 02:18:03.944]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.684 --> 02:18:12.252]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:15.034 --> 02:18:19.979]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.459 --> 02:18:23.980]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.841]  Bill of Regents makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:26.901 --> 02:18:28.041]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:28.061 --> 02:18:28.821]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.841 --> 02:18:29.901]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:30.121 --> 02:18:30.862]  They're after power.
[02:18:31.082 --> 02:18:32.242]  That's what they're after usually.

[02:18:43.765 --> 02:18:44.925]  You have been warned!
[02:18:45.666 --> 02:18:46.326]  It's a fact.
[02:18:46.546 --> 02:18:54.010]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:18:54.130 --> 02:19:03.014]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:19:03.274 --> 02:19:13.819]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:20.143]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:19:20.363 --> 02:19:25.386]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:19:25.566 --> 02:19:30.048]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[02:20:45.908 --> 02:20:49.451]  My neighbor, they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:20:50.031 --> 02:20:54.754]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[02:20:55.294 --> 02:21:00.437]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[02:21:01.037 --> 02:21:08.122]  We would intend not to be standing in the bread line with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[02:21:08.642 --> 02:21:13.545]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the bread line may have no bread.
[02:21:14.165 --> 02:21:21.210]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[02:21:21.991 --> 02:21:26.414]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[02:21:27.115 --> 02:21:27.395]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:21:27.415 --> 02:21:27.455]  800-409-5633.
[02:21:27.475 --> 02:21:28.336]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:21:28.396 --> 02:21:28.556]  Who am I?
[02:21:28.596 --> 02:21:28.856]  Nobody.
[02:21:46.181 --> 02:21:50.064]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio
[02:22:00.476 --> 02:22:12.665]  Well, he's written quite a few books.
[02:22:12.745 --> 02:22:16.487]  One of them is A Primer on CO2 and Climate by Howard C. Hayden.
[02:22:16.968 --> 02:22:17.928]  This is a short segment.
[02:22:17.948 --> 02:22:24.633]  We're going to come back in a longer segment, finish up with him, and then take a few of your calls and recaps and top stories, get to a few things I haven't covered yet.
[02:22:25.422 --> 02:22:28.003]  Look, I've studied history.
[02:22:28.123 --> 02:22:30.004]  I've studied the different climate changes.
[02:22:30.224 --> 02:22:34.406]  We know for 500 years, they've been keeping pretty good records in places like England.
[02:22:35.307 --> 02:22:35.527]  Really, 300.
[02:22:36.867 --> 02:22:39.548]  But we know that the Earth's changing all the time.
[02:22:39.588 --> 02:22:41.309]  The solar system's changing all the time.
[02:22:41.369 --> 02:22:44.150]  The moons of Saturn and Jupiter that were ice are melting.
[02:22:45.211 --> 02:22:54.035]  Up until just a few months ago, now the sun just cooled off, according to NASA and three other institutions that gauge how much energy it's putting off.
[02:22:55.267 --> 02:22:58.210]  Can you elaborate on that and then get back into the ice cores, sir?
[02:22:59.411 --> 02:22:59.652]  Sure.
[02:22:59.732 --> 02:23:07.679]  Well, just to finish up about the ice cores, what they do is they just heat the ice core up
[02:23:09.390 --> 02:23:09.891]  I don't
[02:23:29.125 --> 02:23:31.625]  Well, excuse me here just a minute here.
[02:23:35.246 --> 02:23:40.047]  Glaciers, for example, people talk about the fact that they're receding.
[02:23:40.527 --> 02:23:50.129]  Well, they have been receding quite steadily since about 1750, which is a long time before we started using fossil fuels.
[02:23:50.169 --> 02:23:53.909]  Now, weren't they receding for the last 12,000 years, since the end of the last Ice Age?
[02:23:53.949 --> 02:23:57.390]  I mean, there were glaciers into North Texas.
[02:23:58.416 --> 02:23:59.056]  Well, yeah, yeah.
[02:23:59.096 --> 02:24:01.857]  Well, there's a long, long time.
[02:24:01.897 --> 02:24:06.039]  It was about 18,000 years ago when we were in the depths of the last Ice Age.
[02:24:06.959 --> 02:24:09.240]  But then we went through the Little Ice Age.
[02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:16.283]  In other words, things warmed up in the medieval warm period, which some people deny the existence of.
[02:24:18.147 --> 02:24:20.149]  Things are really quite jolly.
[02:24:20.229 --> 02:24:34.963]  We had nice warm weather and so forth, and then they cooled off in the Little Ice Age, and that was basically coincident with the cooling of the sun, and now it's begun to warm up.
[02:24:35.363 --> 02:24:37.926]  The Little Ice Age ended somewhere around 1750.
[02:24:41.088 --> 02:24:45.910]  Now, you're one of the big experts on this, but I've interviewed literally probably 50 people on this subject.
[02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:49.652]  I've seen the great documentary they just put out in England, you know, debunking.
[02:24:52.853 --> 02:24:53.373]  Are we still there?
[02:24:55.774 --> 02:24:56.094]  Wes?
[02:24:58.075 --> 02:24:58.715]  Okay, sir.
[02:24:59.535 --> 02:25:02.236]  Yeah, we are back here.
[02:25:02.617 --> 02:25:07.278]  I'm in Texas, they're in Minnesota, and we're now able to get you back on.
[02:25:07.338 --> 02:25:07.939]  Are you there, sir?
[02:25:08.379 --> 02:25:08.739]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:25:09.864 --> 02:25:10.845]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:25:10.945 --> 02:25:15.747]  I'm in Texas Air, Minnesota, and we're putting in new lines today, so I think that may have been what just happened.
[02:25:17.327 --> 02:25:18.988]  I'm trying to understand here, though.
[02:25:19.008 --> 02:25:27.032]  I mean, if the science is so simple, how were they able to then engage in this hoax, and why did they decide to push this hoax?
[02:25:30.377 --> 02:25:33.579]  Well, I'm not too good on human motivations.
[02:25:33.939 --> 02:25:39.222]  I don't really understand human motivations, except some people are really driven by money.
[02:25:42.843 --> 02:25:48.686]  The thing that people are looking at is basically computer programs.
[02:25:48.806 --> 02:25:55.790]  They have their right computer programs, and they've actually got gloom and doom built into them.
[02:25:57.173 --> 02:26:23.264]  For example, there was a recent paper, and I can't give you the exact details on this thing, but it was published, and what it described was a positive feedback system whereby if we heated up the earth a little bit by carbon dioxide, then that would kick in more water vapor into the air to heat up the earth a whole lot more, and we're heading for
[02:26:23.804 --> 02:26:25.766]  Hell in a hand basket and so forth.
[02:26:26.347 --> 02:26:45.406]  And so the one chap who is really quite up on this thing studied that and he took part of their computer program and just threw some random numbers in and it showed that their program was guaranteeing a positive feedback.
[02:26:45.446 --> 02:26:47.488]  There was something wrong with their computer program.
[02:26:48.357 --> 02:26:54.422]  So he wrote a paper and sent it to the journal that had published that particular article.
[02:26:55.803 --> 02:27:02.327]  And they sent it on to the author, and the good news is that the author said, oh my gosh, you are right!
[02:27:03.308 --> 02:27:13.235]  So anyway, all of these scenarios about global warming are played out of people's computers, not in reality.
[02:27:14.677 --> 02:27:16.598]  That's the thing to remember.
[02:27:17.757 --> 02:27:18.918]  Absolutely, stay there.
[02:27:19.118 --> 02:27:35.048]  And I saw some of the reports, they would enter into the computer that it was the CO2 that supposedly had this effect, and not the sun, and there would be two different, you know, responses from what reality would have shown.
[02:27:36.449 --> 02:27:37.409]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.429 --> 02:27:39.451]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.371 --> 02:27:43.093]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.443 --> 02:27:47.083]  It's progressing.
[02:27:47.603 --> 02:27:51.404]  It's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[02:27:51.885 --> 02:27:53.325]  We are entering martial law.
[02:27:53.805 --> 02:27:55.966]  There are ten telling signs of martial law.
[02:27:56.506 --> 02:27:57.726]  America has them all.

[02:28:46.405 --> 02:28:46.705]  Fact.
[02:28:46.885 --> 02:28:52.788]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:28:52.928 --> 02:28:57.170]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:28:57.250 --> 02:29:04.774]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:29:04.974 --> 02:29:05.634]  The solution.
[02:29:05.754 --> 02:29:09.796]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:29:09.976 --> 02:29:15.199]  The Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins, while

[02:30:40.439 --> 02:30:41.999]  Well, I appreciate our esteemed guest.
[02:30:42.019 --> 02:30:42.820]  He is retired.
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:00.082]  30-plus year professor, University of Connecticut.
[02:31:00.102 --> 02:31:10.710]  He's written quite a few scholarly works on the environment, a primer on CO2 and climate, solar fraud, and other publications.
[02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:12.931]  You can find out more by going to Amazon.com.
[02:31:13.292 --> 02:31:14.593]  His name is Howard C. Hayden.
[02:31:16.034 --> 02:31:21.498]  Professor Dr. Hayden, I kind of got caught short there on the break.
[02:31:21.518 --> 02:31:23.159]  The point I was trying to make was this.
[02:31:24.685 --> 02:31:29.547]  And I'm just reading the scholarly reports and seeing the news reports about it, so I'm a layman, so correct me.
[02:31:30.267 --> 02:31:41.192]  But, say they'll have an ocean rising model, and then they won't even feed in all these other things like the sun and even major weather patterns.
[02:31:41.212 --> 02:31:46.074]  They'll just feed in a basic equation of what will happen if, you know,
[02:31:48.277 --> 02:32:01.485]  CO2 is released, and then they have it already built in the computer that CO2 will supposedly have enough of a climate driver to heat things up to make the ice caps melt, and then we're going to be flooded.
[02:32:02.245 --> 02:32:08.449]  I mean, that's an oversimplification, or can you break down how they build these models to show this disaster?
[02:32:10.448 --> 02:32:14.833]  Well, one thing is they confuse the North Pole and the South Pole.
[02:32:15.314 --> 02:32:22.061]  The thing that determines conditions at the North Pole is primarily ocean current.
[02:32:24.224 --> 02:32:30.150]  And, for example, there was a recent warming and a whole lot of ice just left.
[02:32:31.115 --> 02:32:36.919]  And the Arctic Sea, and then the ocean currents changed and right away it came back.
[02:32:36.999 --> 02:32:41.882]  It was the fastest rise known, but the records are short.
[02:32:41.902 --> 02:32:44.063]  It only goes back to 1979.
[02:32:45.304 --> 02:32:48.686]  South Pole, let me give you the ski report from the South Pole.
[02:32:48.766 --> 02:32:51.007]  Maybe you have some skiers down there in Texas.
[02:32:52.288 --> 02:32:58.452]  The ski report is two-tenths of an inch of new snow and two miles of base.
[02:32:59.976 --> 02:33:07.881]  And the highest temperature ever recorded down there is 7 degrees at the South Pole Research Station.
[02:33:07.901 --> 02:33:10.823]  The lowest temperature is 117 below.
[02:33:10.843 --> 02:33:17.767]  Now, the last I checked, the melting point of ice hasn't changed.
[02:33:18.667 --> 02:33:24.131]  And so just exactly how does one presume that the South Pole is going to melt?
[02:33:24.911 --> 02:33:25.952]  I mean, for heaven's sake.
[02:33:27.166 --> 02:33:35.808]  Well, also, they do real base things, like they will show polar bears on an ice flow and say, oh look, they're all going to drown.
[02:33:35.828 --> 02:33:37.589]  They don't have a habitat anymore.
[02:33:38.349 --> 02:33:48.272]  But just watching shows about polar bears and reading a few books to my kids over the years, I know that they'll swim a hundred miles, they get out on those flows and hunt beluga and hunt seals.
[02:33:48.892 --> 02:34:05.199]  But the news said they can't swim, they're dead, global warming did this, and I remember reading adventure books, history books about people investigating the South and North Pole, the Strait of Magellan, you know, hundreds of years ago, and how there were always giant icebergs the size of cities breaking off.
[02:34:05.239 --> 02:34:06.459]  I mean, that's what they do.
[02:34:06.539 --> 02:34:16.003]  It rains, it puts more onto the glaciers than they go out to the sea and break off, but I guess polar bears can't swim and glaciers have never had icebergs.
[02:34:17.094 --> 02:34:17.675]  Yeah, right.
[02:34:19.018 --> 02:34:23.185]  Well, let me say something about the Bears.
[02:34:24.368 --> 02:34:29.117]  They have survived actually very well.
[02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:35.293]  And for example, the polar bears go back a long, long time.
[02:34:35.333 --> 02:34:40.336]  About 120,000 years ago or something like that, there was another interglacial.
[02:34:40.936 --> 02:34:43.518]  And it was a good deal warmer than it is today.
[02:34:43.538 --> 02:34:48.902]  And there was hardly any ice up anywhere around the North Pole.
[02:34:49.542 --> 02:34:53.565]  And the polar bears survived that perfectly well at that time.
[02:34:53.665 --> 02:34:56.207]  I don't understand why they wouldn't survive it now.
[02:34:59.754 --> 02:35:02.535]  The polar bear populations are not decreasing.
[02:35:02.555 --> 02:35:07.355]  I think there's one, call it tribe of them, that's seen some decrease.
[02:35:07.435 --> 02:35:16.877]  But overall, the total polar bear population has been either holding steady or slightly increasing.
[02:35:16.897 --> 02:35:21.058]  Yeah, I saw a press report that they're coming further south and that their numbers are higher.
[02:35:21.098 --> 02:35:23.498]  I think it said 25,000 or something?
[02:35:24.079 --> 02:35:25.179]  Yeah, something like that.
[02:35:25.199 --> 02:35:26.359]  There's quite a number of them.
[02:35:27.571 --> 02:35:29.592]  Well, I mean, it's this type of mindless hype.
[02:35:29.652 --> 02:35:44.580]  Now, since you really study what's happening with the sun, and I see so different, you know, all the different reports, but I remember five, six years ago seeing NASA reports about, look, we can see this moon's liquid sea of methane is melting due to the sun's increased output.
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:51.423]  Can you specifically get into the sun as a driver, or is it the main driver in what we've seen in the solar system?
[02:35:51.763 --> 02:35:55.545]  And is the sun now cooling, according to your studies, as NASA says it is?
[02:35:56.934 --> 02:36:08.745]  Yes, the sun is now cooling and the past 60 years have shown the highest solar activity in the last 1400 years.
[02:36:11.107 --> 02:36:29.240]  So, yes, the sun is now cooling, it has been warmer, and we can expect some cooling, but there's also some change in the ocean currents that's periodic, so that there is expected to be some cooling within the next decade or so.
[02:36:30.306 --> 02:36:44.295]  And the temperature history also shows that, that during the, well since January 2001, the temperature of the Earth has basically held almost flat.
[02:36:46.296 --> 02:36:52.640]  It's rising at a 50th of a degree Celsius per decade at the present time.
[02:36:52.660 --> 02:36:56.763]  Now that's just a trend, you know, you can't really predict from trends.
[02:36:57.826 --> 02:37:14.111]  But anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the previous predictions about the horrendous warming that people expected have not come to pass.
[02:37:16.229 --> 02:37:26.711]  It seemed like they were trying to hedge their bet in that day-after-tomorrow propaganda film where they explained that global warming means instant freezing and the destruction of New York by ice.
[02:37:26.791 --> 02:37:31.132]  And so now they're falling back to that, saying, yes, it's the global warming.
[02:37:31.212 --> 02:37:32.932]  Now we're all going to freeze to death.
[02:37:33.832 --> 02:37:35.213]  I'm sure you've heard that newest thing.
[02:37:35.953 --> 02:37:36.633]  Yeah, I have.
[02:37:38.113 --> 02:37:42.894]  The problem with that business is that when you predict everything, you predict nothing.
[02:37:44.846 --> 02:37:49.168]  You just write down a list of things that could happen, you know, that's not a prediction.
[02:37:50.069 --> 02:37:53.771]  And so it's just pure garbage.
[02:37:54.251 --> 02:37:55.512]  No reason to believe any of it.
[02:37:55.652 --> 02:37:58.694]  You talked about the majority of real scientists don't agree with them.
[02:37:58.994 --> 02:38:00.215]  There's been a big controversy.
[02:38:00.415 --> 02:38:13.283]  They had 1,800 people sign on, as you know, I'm telling the audience, this UN document a year or so ago, a year and a half ago, and now it's come out that a lot of them were just invited to the conference, never even signed on, but then saw their names
[02:38:14.184 --> 02:38:25.397]  Uh, and then they cult-like say, there's no disagreement, it's 100%, all scientists agree, which kind of backfired on them because then they're coming out of the woodwork saying, I don't agree, I don't agree.
[02:38:25.797 --> 02:38:28.581]  I mean, again, this is bizarre.
[02:38:28.601 --> 02:38:30.363]  I mean, you speak to the real numbers.
[02:38:30.823 --> 02:38:38.626]  Yeah, there were something like 2,500 people who attended the IPCC gathering in Maui.
[02:38:39.006 --> 02:38:41.567]  Now understand what IPCC stands for.
[02:38:41.587 --> 02:38:46.269]  It's the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[02:38:47.369 --> 02:38:53.992]  And as it turned out, there's only about 52 climate scientists among the whole lot.
[02:38:54.899 --> 02:39:00.965]  And they, among themselves, are in considerable disagreement about things.
[02:39:01.765 --> 02:39:09.392]  And I know of at least one who sued to have his name taken off that list of people it signed.
[02:39:09.912 --> 02:39:12.635]  But there's quite another thing that's gone on.
[02:39:13.195 --> 02:39:18.480]  Independently, there's a petition that was run out of Oregon.
[02:39:19.534 --> 02:39:32.567]  And there were 19,000 scientists who signed a statement saying that the global warming is certainly not proven and the science isn't up to it.
[02:39:33.668 --> 02:39:35.691]  You know, it's not time to panic.
[02:39:37.573 --> 02:39:40.315]  And there's another petition that I
[02:39:42.151 --> 02:39:53.500]  Only know about sort of through back channels that has something like 29,000 signatures on it where people disagree with the IPCC scenario.
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:55.722]  And you notice that's never going to be in the news.
[02:39:56.402 --> 02:39:57.683]  It'll never be in the news.
[02:39:59.044 --> 02:40:00.746]  Well, what can we do to turn this around?
[02:40:00.786 --> 02:40:04.489]  I mean, people can get your book, give it to other physicists, give it to other climatologists.
[02:40:06.005 --> 02:40:10.275]  I'm a nobody when it comes to this, but I've read what all the experts are saying, and they're saying this is a fraud.
[02:40:10.937 --> 02:40:13.102]  Why does Al Gore think he's going to get away with this?
[02:40:14.915 --> 02:40:24.339]  Well, the interesting thing about Al Gore, he was invited to speak at a meeting in New York, which was climate skeptics.
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:27.181]  I was one of those skeptics, by the way.
[02:40:27.941 --> 02:40:33.443]  And he was invited to speak, and they said, name your price.
[02:40:34.184 --> 02:40:36.625]  And they know that his price is usually $200,000 per lecture.
[02:40:36.645 --> 02:40:38.105]  He gets big money out of this thing.
[02:40:42.416 --> 02:40:48.137]  And he refused to speak in front of this group.
[02:40:50.257 --> 02:40:51.618]  And they said, name your price.
[02:40:51.698 --> 02:40:54.998]  If he could have named, say, a million dollars, they would have paid it.
[02:40:55.138 --> 02:41:01.039]  But no, no, he doesn't know this stuff very well.
[02:41:01.059 --> 02:41:08.301]  And he knows that any climate scientist on the planet can shoot him down because of his errors.
[02:41:09.901 --> 02:41:10.841]  So he won't speak.
[02:41:12.287 --> 02:41:19.330]  But then there was a recent meeting of professional engineers up in Denver.
[02:41:19.370 --> 02:41:26.352]  This was the Colorado Professional Engineers, and they decided to have a forum on global warming, and they'd like to hear both sides of the issue.
[02:41:27.452 --> 02:41:39.957]  So they're right there in Denver near Boulder, where NOAA is headquartered, and NCAR, National Center for Atmospheric Care, is located, and so they said, okay, let's just
[02:41:40.478 --> 02:41:40.918]  Thank you.
[02:42:00.613 --> 02:42:04.619]  And all the rest of them that they asked found better things to do.
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:05.300]  I'm busy.
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:07.844]  I'm clipping my toenails that day or something.
[02:42:08.265 --> 02:42:15.716]  But nobody from there would show up to debate some kind of low-level people like myself.
[02:42:16.742 --> 02:42:18.043]  And it wasn't going to be a debate.
[02:42:18.163 --> 02:42:21.105]  They could just make a presentation and leave if they wanted to.
[02:42:21.125 --> 02:42:22.026]  Well, sir, you said it.
[02:42:22.066 --> 02:42:25.048]  You realize that the big banks and the big money, and they're publicly behind it.
[02:42:25.068 --> 02:42:26.029]  We have government documents.
[02:42:27.030 --> 02:42:32.694]  They want the global taxes, and they can't just come say, hey, you know, big government's good.
[02:42:32.774 --> 02:42:34.135]  People know it's not good now.
[02:42:34.175 --> 02:42:35.336]  They've pretty much woken up to that.
[02:42:35.876 --> 02:42:37.637]  And so they say, okay, it's to save you.
[02:42:37.677 --> 02:42:38.998]  If you don't do this, you're going to die.
[02:42:39.058 --> 02:42:43.342]  It's kind of like, well, the UN has said they don't want to have war now as a unifying
[02:42:45.362 --> 02:42:45.662]  I don't
[02:43:02.809 --> 02:43:10.757]  It's like we're a bunch of ignorant savages and they're just telling us, ooga booga, the sun won't come back, you're going to die unless you give me all the power.
[02:43:10.797 --> 02:43:18.025]  I mean, can it, from a sociological perspective, or really from an anthropology view, a doctor, be looked at in that way?
[02:43:18.765 --> 02:43:20.968]  Well, yeah, and I would add another example.
[02:43:21.008 --> 02:43:23.830]  Perhaps you've experienced this thing on your computer that
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:42.602]  You've logged on to some site on the web and then all of a sudden some pop-up starts telling you that you've got some virus in your system or something and then you've got to get some computer program to remove it.
[02:43:43.251 --> 02:43:50.797]  Then every time you turn around you get this pop-up telling you you have to go get this stuff to get the junk out of your system.
[02:43:51.378 --> 02:43:55.201]  Well, this is what we call extortion wear.
[02:43:55.801 --> 02:43:56.322]  Yes.
[02:43:57.323 --> 02:44:05.810]  And the same thing is happening in the global warming scenario that people are basically extorting through fear.
[02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:08.412]  You know, you have to pay us.
[02:44:09.032 --> 02:44:12.075]  Well, that's my final point, Doctor, and it's this.
[02:44:12.854 --> 02:44:16.618]  Now I'm sure you've heard that government heads and others have called for our arrest.
[02:44:17.018 --> 02:44:27.047]  They're saying it's like Holocaust denial, that if you deny that there's global warming and that we need to fix it, that you need to be arrested because it's a crime against humanity.
[02:44:28.542 --> 02:44:35.487]  Well, I haven't heard the arrest part, but I certainly have seen the silencing part.
[02:44:37.409 --> 02:44:45.715]  Listen, you can Google that, and it's all over the British and German news, where they're saying that denying this is like denying the Holocaust and should be illegal.
[02:44:46.515 --> 02:44:48.757]  Yeah, well, I look at it this way.
[02:44:48.777 --> 02:44:56.743]  Al Gore got the Nobel Peace Prize, which puts him right up there with Yasser Arafat.
[02:44:57.814 --> 02:45:04.217]  And he refers to people like us as skeptics and deniers, and that puts us right down there with Galileo.
[02:45:04.658 --> 02:45:04.978]  Thank you.
[02:45:15.914 --> 02:45:20.416]  Well, I have a primer on CO2 and climate.
[02:45:20.516 --> 02:45:25.918]  It's available at baleslake.com and it's available at Amazon also.
[02:45:27.379 --> 02:45:32.861]  Sales are running high on that and I'll be coming out with a second issue, second edition pretty soon.
[02:45:33.782 --> 02:45:38.063]  And then another one is called the Solar Fraud Second Edition.
[02:45:38.083 --> 02:45:41.745]  The subtitle is Why Solar Energy Won't Run the World.
[02:45:42.449 --> 02:45:44.290]  Well, they're clearly going for broke now.
[02:45:44.310 --> 02:45:46.370]  I mean, they don't care that they've been shown to be frauds.
[02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:59.274]  This being one of the coldest winters in modern times, though, the federal government even admitting that right now, globally, they're going to have trouble spinning this gloom and doom when every one of their conferences keeps getting blizzarded out.
[02:46:00.265 --> 02:46:12.529]  Yeah, well actually I look forward to having this whole thing quiet down and winding up with a bunch of unsold books because the thing has gotten out of people's minds and they're just not excited about it anymore.
[02:46:13.829 --> 02:46:15.770]  Well, I think we're starting to turn the corner.
[02:46:15.790 --> 02:46:29.174]  A lot of people who believed in it a year ago, when they saw the NFL pushing it and Bush even saying he was for it now, I think the massive corporate push, people went, wait a minute, wait a minute, something stinks.
[02:46:30.703 --> 02:46:39.767]  Well, yeah, I think so, but you have to be eternally vigilant because they're always out there and they're after your pocketbook.
[02:46:40.107 --> 02:46:42.108]  Oh, no, I agree that the fight's hot and heavy.
[02:46:42.148 --> 02:46:43.169]  We're in the thick of the fight.
[02:46:43.249 --> 02:46:46.630]  I just think that now people are finally realizing it's a fraud.
[02:46:46.650 --> 02:46:47.551]  They're not stopping.
[02:46:47.851 --> 02:46:49.892]  Maybe that's why they're tripling and quadrupling.
[02:46:49.912 --> 02:46:52.013]  I mean, have you seen how they're just going wild?
[02:46:52.033 --> 02:46:54.834]  Do you think maybe they're getting desperate?
[02:46:55.660 --> 02:47:23.972]  Well, I think so, but by the way, I have written a paper once that was published in Nuclear News, and it advised the nuclear industry not to take on this global warming as an argument for nuclear, because nuclear has plenty of its own merits, and they should not rest the strong case on weak arguments.
[02:47:24.856 --> 02:47:35.003]  And I don't know if that had any influence on the nuclear community, but I am happy to say that they have been fairly circumspect about this issue.
[02:47:35.023 --> 02:47:38.206]  They haven't joined that bandwagon.
[02:47:42.572 --> 02:47:43.173]  Absolutely.
[02:47:43.613 --> 02:47:44.013]  All right.
[02:47:44.073 --> 02:47:46.896]  Well, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:47:46.936 --> 02:47:50.038]  He's Howard C. Hayden, a primer on CO2 and climate.
[02:47:50.058 --> 02:47:51.920]  This is his best-selling book right now.
[02:47:51.980 --> 02:47:52.901]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:47:53.321 --> 02:47:54.022]  You're very welcome.
[02:47:54.042 --> 02:47:54.382]  Thank you.
[02:47:54.642 --> 02:47:54.842]  You bet.
[02:47:54.862 --> 02:47:55.263]  There he goes.
[02:47:55.283 --> 02:47:56.684]  We're going to come back in the final segment.
[02:47:56.764 --> 02:47:58.065]  I know I said I'd take your calls.
[02:47:58.505 --> 02:47:59.386]  Who knows if I can?
[02:47:59.406 --> 02:48:00.467]  I've got some final news.
[02:48:00.867 --> 02:48:05.131]  Bob Chapman was going to pop in, but we kind of double-booked some guests.
[02:48:05.211 --> 02:48:07.172]  The dollar is imploding right now.
[02:48:08.153 --> 02:48:10.275]  Before we go to break in the final segment, let me tell you about Interfood.
[02:48:11.554 --> 02:48:15.458]  ENERFOOD.COM is the best green food out there.
[02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:17.741]  The food is so debased.
[02:48:17.921 --> 02:48:23.967]  It has lost so much of its value, even if it's organic or non-GMO, because of what they've been doing with the crops.
[02:48:24.548 --> 02:48:26.169]  High quality green food.
[02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:28.432]  Go to INFOWARS.COM.
[02:48:28.572 --> 02:48:29.693]  Link through on that banner.
[02:48:29.933 --> 02:48:30.654]  The Inner Health
[02:48:31.711 --> 02:48:32.492]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:32.512 --> 02:48:33.613]  A new world order.
[02:48:33.633 --> 02:48:36.515]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[02:48:37.035 --> 02:48:38.196]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:48:38.216 --> 02:48:40.678]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.733 --> 02:49:04.156]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.897 --> 02:49:12.225]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:15.248 --> 02:49:20.211]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.691 --> 02:49:24.194]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.554 --> 02:49:27.076]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:27.136 --> 02:49:28.276]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:28.296 --> 02:49:29.057]  They're not after money.
[02:49:29.077 --> 02:49:30.137]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:30.338 --> 02:49:31.138]  They're after power.
[02:49:31.338 --> 02:49:32.359]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:49:41.965 --> 02:49:43.666]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.986 --> 02:49:45.207]  You have been warned.
[02:49:46.568 --> 02:49:47.708]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[02:49:47.728 --> 02:49:50.130]  I'm the nuclear medical report here on Genesis.
[02:49:50.250 --> 02:49:53.251]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals, U.S.
[02:49:53.291 --> 02:49:53.972]  is a real thing.
[02:49:54.052 --> 02:50:00.956]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial, antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:50:01.076 --> 02:50:06.339]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:50:06.499 --> 02:50:07.239]  We're good to go!
[02:50:33.314 --> 02:50:38.135]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.

[02:50:42.096 --> 02:50:45.037]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:50:45.897 --> 02:50:47.737]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:50:47.838 --> 02:50:49.278]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:50:49.378 --> 02:50:52.299]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:50:52.439 --> 02:50:55.299]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:50:55.479 --> 02:50:58.140]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[02:51:44.944 --> 02:51:46.464]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:51:46.484 --> 02:51:46.664]  Wait.
[02:51:47.505 --> 02:51:49.526]  Wait, whoa, whoa.
[02:51:49.686 --> 02:51:52.367]  Whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[02:51:53.628 --> 02:51:53.768]  Wait.
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:56.860]  Look, look.
[02:51:57.681 --> 02:51:58.682]  This is the deal, folks.
[02:51:59.202 --> 02:52:03.366]  All these people that are paranoid about the world come and scream at me everywhere.
[02:52:03.386 --> 02:52:08.070]  Alright, I'll answer.
[02:52:09.671 --> 02:52:09.951]  Okay.
[02:52:10.192 --> 02:52:11.533]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:52:13.294 --> 02:52:16.717]  Now, you said you would go if I answered the question, right?
[02:52:18.419 --> 02:52:20.321]  You said you would go if I answered the question.
[02:52:21.281 --> 02:52:22.903]  You said you would go if I answered the question.
[02:52:24.457 --> 02:52:26.158]  You said you would go if I answered the question.
[02:52:26.178 --> 02:52:28.120]  All right, here's the answer.
[02:52:29.721 --> 02:52:31.943]  I happened to be in Europe then on my way to Russia.
[02:52:32.023 --> 02:52:36.947]  I was invited to go to Bilderberg by Vernon Jordan, a friend of mine and a genuine hero of the Civil Rights Movement.
[02:52:37.347 --> 02:52:40.449]  And to the best of my knowledge, I have not been discussed by anybody.
[02:52:40.509 --> 02:52:44.132]  Bill Clinton would never admit he went to Bilderberg and has lied about it in the past.
[02:52:44.172 --> 02:52:47.595]  There's We Are Change confronting him on that.
[02:52:47.755 --> 02:52:48.516]  Great job.
[02:52:48.536 --> 02:52:49.957]  9-11 Truth there as well.
[02:52:50.477 --> 02:52:52.378]  We Are Change confronted Larry Silverstein.
[02:52:52.439 --> 02:52:54.160]  It is an incredible confrontation.
[02:52:54.898 --> 02:52:56.259]  I just learned about it this morning.
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:57.541]  They're always on fire.
[02:52:58.041 --> 02:53:00.744]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:53:01.164 --> 02:53:06.389]  I meant to play that, but I don't think we're going to have time to play that today.
[02:53:06.429 --> 02:53:14.497]  We just ran out of time with all the guests and the info and your calls and the material that we covered here today.
[02:53:14.517 --> 02:53:16.078]  And we had Ron Paul on, of course.
[02:53:16.639 --> 02:53:17.740]  The show's about to end.
[02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:18.921]  If you missed Ron Paul,
[02:53:19.984 --> 02:53:23.306]  Uh, at the first of the show, it's going to restart at InfoWars.com.
[02:53:23.806 --> 02:53:27.367]  You can tune in, uh, even if your AminFM station is already aired the show.
[02:53:28.068 --> 02:53:30.669]  You can, whenever you want, go to InfoWars.com.
[02:53:30.689 --> 02:53:34.711]  When the show ends, there are streams 21 hours a day until the next live show.
[02:53:34.971 --> 02:53:40.293]  But in this case of Friday, it'll restream until Sunday when I'm back live 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:53:40.333 --> 02:53:49.237]  Central Time out of the studios of NewsRadio 590K LBJ and syndicated on stations like KCAA in San Diego and KCXL in Kansas City and
[02:53:50.063 --> 02:53:55.365]  Florida, New York, Ohio, to all those affiliates that pick up the Sunday show and the weekday show.
[02:53:55.405 --> 02:53:55.865]  Thank you.
[02:53:56.545 --> 02:54:00.006]  But I do hope that you will join me this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:00.446 --> 02:54:01.547]  We'll have big news on Monday.
[02:54:01.567 --> 02:54:06.308]  We've got Bob Chapman coming on and a lot of other important news as we watch the meltdown of the dollar.
[02:54:08.629 --> 02:54:09.949]  It's just amazing what's happening.
[02:54:09.969 --> 02:54:15.351]  With this Larry Silverstein clip, again, go to Infowars.com, go to JonesReport.com.
[02:54:15.371 --> 02:54:16.552]  Aaron's written a story about it.
[02:54:18.738 --> 02:54:20.219]  I meant to play it in the last segment.
[02:54:20.239 --> 02:54:22.101]  I thought we'd send it to the network, but they didn't have it.
[02:54:22.501 --> 02:54:24.503]  I guess you've got it now, but not time to play it, right?
[02:54:27.525 --> 02:54:28.165]  Yeah, okay.
[02:54:28.185 --> 02:54:29.506]  We'll find out the mystery of this.
[02:54:29.947 --> 02:54:30.547]  It doesn't matter.
[02:54:30.607 --> 02:54:32.028]  See it at InfoWars.com.
[02:54:32.048 --> 02:54:32.709]  It's incredible.
[02:54:32.969 --> 02:54:35.431]  I want to get Luke on and the rest of the We Are Change guys Monday.
[02:54:35.471 --> 02:54:37.072]  They are just on fire.
[02:54:37.393 --> 02:54:38.854]  It's freaking the politicians out.
[02:54:39.034 --> 02:54:40.375]  Everywhere they go.
[02:54:41.286 --> 02:54:42.247]  They're being confronted.
[02:54:42.307 --> 02:54:48.952]  Everywhere they go, issues of 9-11, New World Order, open borders, gun control, land grabbing, corruption.
[02:54:49.573 --> 02:54:50.394]  It's coming out.
[02:54:50.474 --> 02:54:51.234]  We're on the march.
[02:54:51.274 --> 02:54:53.917]  The empire is on the run in a big fat way.
[02:54:55.618 --> 02:55:00.222]  So again, I'm asking you to spread the word about InfoWars.com.
[02:55:00.262 --> 02:55:01.383]  I'm asking you to go there.
[02:55:01.723 --> 02:55:03.885]  Join the free MySpace account system.
[02:55:04.525 --> 02:55:05.586]  There's a great community there.
[02:55:05.626 --> 02:55:06.246]  I want it to grow.
[02:55:06.306 --> 02:55:07.187]  It's gotten pretty big.
[02:55:07.467 --> 02:55:08.408]  I want it to grow even bigger.
[02:55:08.488 --> 02:55:11.510]  Post your own articles, your own videos, your own info there.
[02:55:11.650 --> 02:55:13.031]  Use it as a base of operations.
[02:55:13.431 --> 02:55:16.093]  That's InfoWars.com and the InfoWars Network.
[02:55:17.014 --> 02:55:17.374]  Free.
[02:55:18.454 --> 02:55:19.815]  Go join this weekend.
[02:55:20.016 --> 02:55:20.436]  Use it.
[02:55:20.556 --> 02:55:21.096]  Network.
[02:55:21.557 --> 02:55:22.697]  That's what I want it to be.
[02:55:23.178 --> 02:55:24.499]  Post comments in the stories.
[02:55:24.879 --> 02:55:26.680]  We really updated and made InfoWars better.
[02:55:26.900 --> 02:55:29.342]  We're doing the same thing with Prison Planet right now.
[02:55:30.490 --> 02:55:36.856]  And in closing, another fine sponsor, Aloe's Body Cleanze totally cleans out your entire system.
[02:55:37.436 --> 02:55:40.099]  And these are the type sponsors that make this show possible, by the way.
[02:55:40.799 --> 02:55:42.481]  And I only bring you sponsors I believe in.
[02:55:43.942 --> 02:55:49.707]  And this high quality herbal detox is amazing.
[02:55:49.767 --> 02:55:50.448]  It's documented.
[02:55:50.508 --> 02:55:51.769]  It totally flushes you out.
[02:55:52.489 --> 02:55:54.011]  Aloe Vera is just an amazing plant.
[02:55:54.031 --> 02:55:54.091]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:55:58.628 --> 02:55:58.788]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:02.710]  Aloe's Body Cleanze.
[02:56:02.730 --> 02:56:03.471]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:56:04.932 --> 02:56:07.613]  And yes, that deal goes to this weekend, Ted said.
[02:56:07.973 --> 02:56:12.276]  Gold locked in at prices lower than they are right now at over a thousand.
[02:56:13.077 --> 02:56:13.417]  Lower.
[02:56:13.817 --> 02:56:14.077]  At 1-800-686-2237.
[02:56:14.097 --> 02:56:14.537]  1-800-686-237.
[02:56:14.698 --> 02:56:21.121]  Folks, we're just seeing amazing things happen.
[02:56:21.362 --> 02:56:22.202]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.242 --> 02:56:24.644]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
