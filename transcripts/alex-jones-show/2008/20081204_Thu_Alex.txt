[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.309]  Big Brother!
[00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:19.930]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:21.772]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:23.233]  You want answers?
[00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:24.914]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:29.238]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:33.801]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:40.302]  For the rest of this hour and the entirety of the next, we have two great guests on with us.
[00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:48.892]  We're going to open the phones up at the end of the show, the last 30 minutes or so, for our guests joining us from Central America, down in Panama.
[00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:52.076]  We're the founders of Natural Solutions Foundation.
[00:00:52.596 --> 00:00:59.704]  I tried to go over both their bios, it would take all day, but Major General Albert N. Stubblebine, U.S.
[00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:03.107]  Army retired, and of course he headed up the U.S.
[00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:05.450]  Army's Electronic Research and Development Command, U.S.
[00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:11.376]  Army's Intelligence and Security Command, he was the head of Army Special Forces, the head of Fort Bragg,
[00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:17.083]  He's worked with some of the biggest and some of the most secretive defense contractors.
[00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:21.949]  He's been involved in some of the most secretive black op operations.
[00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.774]  And after all these years of research, he's come to basically the same conclusion I have.
[00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.038]  This is a giant world government set up to carry out eugenics.
[00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:56.277]  An extermination of the majority of the public with ambient soft kill weapons being slowly and incrementally turned up and then institutionalizing and covering up through compartmentalization the deaths, the diseases, cancer, one in 33 having it now, one in two males, one in three females, diabetes up thousands of percentile, the media saying that poison, melamine in milk is good, saying that the deadly plastic chemicals are good as people die in mass,
[00:01:57.077 --> 00:02:01.998]  Saying that GMO foods that sterilize the rats and mice are good for us as it sterilizes the public.
[00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.379]  As sperm counts drop by more than eighty percent.
[00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:05.539]  Women are infertile.
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.780]  Just mass plagues all by design.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.220]  And they have studied it all.
[00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:17.723]  They have really single-handedly, with the help of the folks that are members of their organization, helped shoot down a lot of takeovers by Codex Alimentarius.
[00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:20.964]  They've been some of the sole reporters who at gunpoint have been
[00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:27.309]  Pushed out of public meetings that they've been guest of at the UN.
[00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.611]  Just amazing stories.
[00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.993]  So I wanted to have them on with us.
[00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:37.059]  Major General Stubblebine and the Medical Director of HealthFreedomUSA.org.
[00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.565]  And that is Rima E. Labo, MD, graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
[00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:45.727]  And then it goes through all of her amazing
[00:02:46.748 --> 00:02:48.169]  Well, and it's great to be here!
[00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.065]  A lot is happening.
[00:03:10.265 --> 00:03:15.792]  Just a side issue before we get into the Codex Alimentarius, what you saw in Europe, and bring the doctor in.
[00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:19.777]  Have you heard all the big announcements that they're going to abolish the National Guard?
[00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:22.180]  I have all the documents here, but it's in the Washington Post.
[00:03:22.741 --> 00:03:25.784]  And put them under NORTHCOM, and it says for civil insurrection
[00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:35.387]  And to work with the police, and they're deploying microwave guns in all the major cities to prepare, I guess, for war with the American people.
[00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:41.428]  I had a retired JAG colonel on the first hour saying that this is unconstitutional.
[00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:45.049]  What's your take on it, being the former head of special forces?
[00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.330]  It's absolutely not constitutional.
[00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.211]  And it bothers the hell out of me, if you really want to know.
[00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:58.415]  Well, please elaborate, sir, because this is... I think it is horrible.
[00:04:00.797 --> 00:04:02.699]  You know, we have a Constitution.
[00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.743]  And what we've done with it is burn it, throw it away, and forget about it.
[00:04:07.923 --> 00:04:08.803]  And it's wrong.
[00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:22.934]  Now, when you were heading up the areas of the Army in the 70s and 80s and into the early 90s, or back in the 80s, I mean, back then, if they tried this with the Army then, what would you be saying if you were there today?
[00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:25.016]  It'd be a revolt.
[00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:27.875]  They would say, you can't do that.
[00:04:28.695 --> 00:04:30.376]  It's not constitutional.
[00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:43.663]  You cannot use the military, the army, or the navy, or the marines, or the air force, for civil, for civil actions.
[00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:47.105]  It is not constitutional.
[00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:49.766]  And that's exactly what we would have said then.
[00:04:51.238 --> 00:04:53.899]  Why isn't it constitutional?
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.601]  Why is it not constitutional?
[00:04:56.661 --> 00:05:02.704]  Why did the founders, why did every other civilized nation say you don't have your army engaging the people?
[00:05:02.724 --> 00:05:06.326]  Because the army is meant to kill people and break things and go after enemies.
[00:05:06.646 --> 00:05:13.090]  I mean, why did the Romans 2,000 years ago say it's against the law for Caesar to bring the troops into Rome?
[00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.473]  Because you didn't want somebody who could become then a dictator
[00:05:20.704 --> 00:05:41.534]  By using the army to quell any kind of unrest, any kind of disagreement, you didn't want this so-called ruler to take advantage of the power of the army, literally, to quell the populace.
[00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:48.697]  That's the reason that they made it unconstitutional, because they knew, then,
[00:05:50.273 --> 00:06:00.725]  That it was not going to be correct if a ruler could become a dictator by using the military.
[00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:01.906]  Very simple.
[00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:08.073]  And that's what the Army War College and the Naval War College and all of them said for hundreds of years.
[00:06:10.547 --> 00:06:16.552]  My dad's got a big book, The History of the Army, and right in there it has several chapters saying what you just said.
[00:06:17.053 --> 00:06:23.418]  So the Army has to know what they're being told to do now is treason against the Constitution.
[00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:39.351]  Well, you know, it's very interesting because at some level, or some levels, we apparently have sort of morphed into this position we're in.
[00:06:41.322 --> 00:06:49.764]  Instead of, you know, we didn't just sort of jump into this thing one day and suddenly be there.
[00:06:50.604 --> 00:06:53.805]  We've kind of oozed or morphed into this thing.
[00:06:54.525 --> 00:07:04.987]  I don't know what the current commanders are thinking, but I cannot help but believe that they are very, very upset with some of the things that are going on.
[00:07:06.248 --> 00:07:07.628]  I mean, you know, they brought this
[00:07:08.712 --> 00:07:09.292]  I don't know.
[00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:46.276]  I can't believe that a commander who's being given that order doesn't say, what the hell is going on here?
[00:07:46.296 --> 00:07:48.497]  That's right.
[00:07:48.517 --> 00:07:50.139]  I was going to say, all of the National Guard.
[00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:04.755]  Yeah, and then I read deeper and it talks about Obama's civilian corps of one million.
[00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:06.275]  Does that concern you, sir?
[00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:08.737]  A one million man spy corps?
[00:08:11.318 --> 00:08:13.539]  Or is that going to be a personal army?
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.381]  Oh no, it's going to be outside the army, you're right.
[00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:21.364]  Yes, they're saying it's going to be a federal domestic force.
[00:08:21.384 --> 00:08:26.947]  I mean, how do people not recognize that that is... I mean, that is classic tyranny, is it not, sir?
[00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:32.101]  Okay, how can you have your own army?
[00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:33.982]  I mean, look at Blackwater.
[00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:36.704]  You know, what is Blackwater?
[00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:40.726]  Whose allegiance does Blackwater swear to?
[00:08:41.467 --> 00:08:42.547]  To the Constitution?
[00:08:43.968 --> 00:08:45.449]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.811]  Does it swear to Halliburton?
[00:08:49.952 --> 00:08:50.852]  Well, I think so.
[00:08:51.773 --> 00:08:57.016]  So how do you then have your own personal army and
[00:08:58.106 --> 00:09:01.388]  Then is there more than one personal army out there?
[00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.810]  You know, Halliburton got one?
[00:09:07.071 --> 00:09:08.572]  Obama have one?
[00:09:09.152 --> 00:09:10.273]  Does McCain have one?
[00:09:11.074 --> 00:09:13.995]  Who else has their own personal army?
[00:09:14.856 --> 00:09:15.536]  And why?
[00:09:16.136 --> 00:09:20.539]  You know, the big question is not do they do, but why do they have it?
[00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:27.363]  Well, what's coming, Alex, what's coming that we don't know that each one of these individuals
[00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:34.789]  What is that in your educated opinion, General?
[00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:50.959]  I think something is getting ready to happen which is devastating, and I don't know whether it's another false flag event like 9-11, I don't know whether it's a
[00:09:56.684 --> 00:09:58.245]  Avian flu pandemic.
[00:09:59.005 --> 00:09:59.685]  I don't know.
[00:09:59.705 --> 00:10:03.227]  I don't know the exact details.
[00:10:04.507 --> 00:10:05.267]  What is coming?
[00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:08.029]  You can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:16.292]  People in the power structure know that they need an army, their private army.
[00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:24.155]  The people in the power structure know that they need train the regular army.
[00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:43.998]  And you're saying you believe, they've been setting this up quietly for decades, as you know, it seems it's all coming to a head.
[00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:49.782]  Are you saying, General, the evidence is showing it's going to be initiated, it's going to be staged?
[00:10:54.316 --> 00:10:58.758]  It's very interesting because let me tell you how the intelligence works.
[00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:04.560]  First of all, any single piece of information is nothing more than a dot.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.340]  That's all it is.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.121]  It is an unverified piece of information.
[00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:14.283]  Then you get another unverified piece of information.
[00:11:15.003 --> 00:11:18.184]  And a third unverified piece of information.
[00:11:18.224 --> 00:11:19.285]  So I now have three dots.
[00:11:19.905 --> 00:11:20.605]  And four dots.
[00:11:21.005 --> 00:11:23.566]  Then when I get to a hundred dots, suddenly
[00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:26.793]  It's a picture that emerges out of the dots.
[00:11:27.493 --> 00:11:29.035]  It's no longer a set of dots.
[00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:31.236]  It's a picture that emerges.
[00:11:32.097 --> 00:11:52.954]  Oh, by the way, even though each dot may or may not be fully substantiated, the mass of the dots that come out to create the picture, suddenly, you're sitting there looking at all these dots, and suddenly, out of this, it's like a 3D crossword, or a 3D
[00:11:54.571 --> 00:11:55.292]  It's a picture puzzle.
[00:11:55.512 --> 00:11:57.954]  Exactly, that's how... Oh, amazing, General, stay there.
[00:11:57.974 --> 00:12:02.357]  We're going to break and come back, and then shift into the health attack, what's happening, how we counter it.
[00:12:02.577 --> 00:12:05.219]  But that's exactly how I described it myself earlier this week.
[00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:09.662]  I'll study things for years, and then finally, it's like all the pieces come together.
[00:12:09.702 --> 00:12:11.784]  It's exactly what you're saying.
[00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:13.825]  I want to skip this break.
[00:12:13.865 --> 00:12:15.767]  I want to skip this break, John.
[00:12:17.108 --> 00:12:18.069]  General Stubblebine.
[00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.111]  General Stubblebine.
[00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:23.234]  You should be there.
[00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:26.257]  I think he's handing the phone to Dr. Labo.
[00:12:26.277 --> 00:12:26.817]  Dr. Labo?
[00:12:28.058 --> 00:12:28.679]  Yeah, I'm here too.
[00:12:29.059 --> 00:12:31.321]  Are you guys sharing the telephone again down there in Panama?
[00:12:31.621 --> 00:12:32.842]  No, we have separate phones.
[00:12:33.243 --> 00:12:34.043]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:12:34.744 --> 00:12:36.686]  Listen, listen, we're on the internet live right now.
[00:12:36.706 --> 00:12:39.588]  We're going to be back on the main AM and FM when we come back.
[00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:42.331]  What do you guys both want to get into first?
[00:12:42.891 --> 00:12:44.432]  What Codex Alimentarius is?
[00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:58.535]  Recap of how you've been fighting it, what the latest meeting revealed, and then go through the catalog of things they're doing to us, and then how to counter it, and then how folks can go join your organization.
[00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:00.959]  Get on your free mailing list?
[00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:17.693]  We also want to have time, Alex, to talk about reclaiming the production of food and taking back your health by taking back your food, becoming an intensive farmer in your apartment or whatever, and we want to talk about the Panama Project.
[00:13:19.454 --> 00:13:21.136]  Let me just briefly ask the General a question.
[00:13:21.476 --> 00:13:28.442]  General, were you done with the statement about the dots, or do you want to briefly, when we come back, finish that and then get into all the other topics, or are you done?
[00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:36.626]  All I want to do is just like you did, suddenly a picture emerges and you say, oh, truth dawns then.
[00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:38.547]  And now what do you do with it?
[00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:42.229]  You're stuck with this picture and you now have to
[00:13:43.536 --> 00:13:47.779]  You know, take the countermeasures against that.
[00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:50.000]  I mean, you call it dots.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.641]  Now they're just announcing it.
[00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:54.363]  I mean, they say this is for the American people.
[00:13:54.403 --> 00:13:56.364]  They say they're going to use the army on us.
[00:13:56.624 --> 00:13:58.105]  They say torture's good.
[00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:01.827]  And it's psychological warfare.
[00:14:01.847 --> 00:14:04.789]  I mean, you're an expert in this, but perhaps you can speak to this when we come back, too.
[00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:07.751]  And then we're going to do a big turn with Dr. Labo.
[00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:08.632]  We appreciate her being here.
[00:14:09.452 --> 00:14:17.195]  Is that it seems they're throwing it in our face to kind of just shock us into acclimation when they go, we always said mercury was bad, now it's good for kids.
[00:14:17.516 --> 00:14:20.517]  We always said melamine was bad, now we say it's good for kids.
[00:14:21.217 --> 00:14:24.098]  You know, we always said that poison was bad, now it's good.
[00:14:24.118 --> 00:14:33.562]  I mean, it's like they're wanting to reveal... This was predicted and this was delineated by George Orwell.
[00:14:33.662 --> 00:14:34.923]  We know how this works.
[00:14:36.044 --> 00:14:40.927]  He was a prescient genius who told us, they're following the Orwellian script.
[00:14:41.127 --> 00:14:43.328]  They do it just as he said they would do it.
[00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:52.973]  They twist meaning, they change reality, and if we're not alert and holding on to our reality, we become their pawn.
[00:14:53.653 --> 00:14:54.493]  Absolutely.
[00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:56.774]  One point, we're going live in one minute.
[00:14:58.803 --> 00:14:59.123]  Fabulous!
[00:14:59.143 --> 00:14:59.383]  Fabulous!
[00:15:23.446 --> 00:15:26.627]  You're the only person in the world that I'd ever agree to back off for.
[00:15:26.647 --> 00:15:30.630]  But you are a little loud.
[00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:39.215]  See, I've got it cranked way up so I can hear the General, and then when you talk, it's like, it's like the thunders.
[00:15:39.235 --> 00:15:40.556]  How about this, Alex?
[00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:42.337]  I'm holding the phone further away.
[00:15:42.357 --> 00:15:42.857]  Does that help?
[00:15:44.318 --> 00:15:47.260]  Yeah, it's a lot better.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:47.600]  Here we go.
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.701]  We're going live in 20 seconds.
[00:15:49.602 --> 00:15:51.904]  And we'll come back and have the general finish and then go back to you.
[00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.605]  This is a short segment, a long one.
[00:15:53.825 --> 00:15:56.507]  We have an 18-minute segment coming up, so you won't be interrupted after this one.
[00:15:56.787 --> 00:15:57.527]  This is a short one.
[00:15:57.547 --> 00:15:58.068]  Here we go, guys.
[00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:17.192]  Alright, let's go right back to our guest, General Stubblebine.
[00:16:17.212 --> 00:16:25.777]  Finishing up the point about intelligence, a dot here, a dot there, and then overall, you get the clear picture.
[00:16:25.837 --> 00:16:30.119]  Now it's not even dots, they're just throwing it in our face, admitting everything.
[00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:32.080]  Finish up that thought, sir.
[00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:43.586]  Well look, the first thing that, when you have the dots, and you know, it's nothing but a set of dots, and then suddenly, just suddenly, the entire picture just sort of
[00:16:44.227 --> 00:16:48.428]  is there in front of you and you said, Oh my God, I've had this information all along.
[00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:49.309]  Bingo.
[00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.909]  There it is.
[00:16:50.369 --> 00:16:50.989]  Now I know.
[00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.531]  The question then becomes, what do I do about it?
[00:16:55.711 --> 00:17:00.513]  When I know what the picture is and I know it's horrific, what the heck do I do?
[00:17:01.013 --> 00:17:02.213]  Do I just accept it?
[00:17:02.693 --> 00:17:08.075]  Do I just sort of lay down and give up?
[00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:10.976]  Or do I begin to resist?
[00:17:11.036 --> 00:17:13.537]  Do I mount a resistance of some sort?
[00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.212]  What do I do with this picture now that I know what it is?
[00:17:17.812 --> 00:17:29.518]  And what's happening, Alex, unfortunately, and you mentioned it, what's happening is they're now saying, oh yes, by the way, we are going to destroy the Constitution.
[00:17:29.558 --> 00:17:31.418]  We're not going to pay attention to the Constitution.
[00:17:31.439 --> 00:17:40.523]  And oh, by the way, we are going to deploy army troops to quell any kind of resistance that you might put up.
[00:17:41.016 --> 00:17:46.377]  And if you resist, you probably are going to go into a detainment camp somewhere.
[00:17:47.157 --> 00:17:55.459]  Well, now that they're pronouncing it, now that they're saying it, again, what does the populace do?
[00:17:55.479 --> 00:17:57.800]  I'll tell you what most of it is doing.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.721]  It's saying, whoa, back off, back off, back off.
[00:18:02.301 --> 00:18:03.681]  I think I will be quiet.
[00:18:04.121 --> 00:18:06.822]  I think I will just shut up and pay attention.
[00:18:09.568 --> 00:18:33.513]  So you're saying they're openly announcing it to cause a chilling effect, and A, that's one question, and then B, I'm going to throw this in, they threaten Congress as you know, or if you don't we'll play the clip, Senator Inhofe admits it, others, with martial law they wouldn't pass the banker takeover, so this is the illegitimate government menacing the real government.
[00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:34.213]  Go ahead.
[00:18:35.836 --> 00:18:42.239]  That's exactly what's happening, and oh, by the way, what is happening with all of these announcements?
[00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:45.700]  The introduction of fear.
[00:18:46.721 --> 00:18:48.381]  Fear subdues.
[00:18:49.162 --> 00:18:57.825]  And let me tell you, that's exactly where they're headed, because they're going to make it fearful for anybody to do anything in the way of resistance.
[00:18:58.405 --> 00:18:58.826]  Period.
[00:18:59.146 --> 00:19:00.987]  Well, is something wrong with me, then, or you?
[00:19:01.427 --> 00:19:04.088]  All this does is make me angry and want to mount a resistance.
[00:19:05.367 --> 00:19:06.748]  Well, may I jump in?
[00:19:06.828 --> 00:19:18.995]  Yes, go ahead, Dr. I think what's happening is that you and General Pebblebine and I and the other patriots and freedom folks have not brushed their teeth with enough fluoride.
[00:19:20.516 --> 00:19:34.465]  Fluoride, as I'm sure your listeners know, Alex, and as I know you know, was used initially in the Soviet gulag to make the political prisoners easy to deal with.
[00:19:34.963 --> 00:19:35.403]  Thank you.
[00:19:51.988 --> 00:19:54.549]  Hold on, we've got an hour and a half coming up so we can get into that.
[00:19:54.850 --> 00:20:00.352]  By the way, two years ago, the American Medical Association said, kids under six, don't give it to them, it's bad for your teeth.
[00:20:00.432 --> 00:20:07.215]  So, for those that don't believe us, they admit it's not good for your teeth, it causes dental firosis, but you're a medical doctor.
[00:20:07.895 --> 00:20:09.216]  So, I mean, certainly you can speak to that.
[00:20:10.497 --> 00:20:11.117]  Absolutely.
[00:20:11.417 --> 00:20:14.919]  But the point is that we have been poisoned, we have been
[00:20:16.092 --> 00:20:18.513]  subdued psychologically through the media.
[00:20:18.873 --> 00:20:32.278]  We have been rendered fearful and we have been rendered apathetic by the toxins in our diet, by the microwaves, and by the toxic information or quote information that we've taken in.
[00:20:32.978 --> 00:20:34.079]  It's having its effect.
[00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:43.082]  This is a full-spectrum cocktail and then you find out they knew decades before and they deploy these as weapon systems against us, General.
[00:20:45.407 --> 00:20:46.087]  Absolutely.
[00:20:46.147 --> 00:20:47.728]  And guess what?
[00:20:48.249 --> 00:20:52.991]  The food that is being degraded is being used as a weapon.
[00:20:53.371 --> 00:21:00.595]  I mean, you know, it's not being touted right now as weaponized food, but that's exactly where they're going and that's exactly what's happening.
[00:21:01.015 --> 00:21:12.841]  And so every bit of bite of food that you take in, if you allow them the privilege of eating the food that they would like you to eat,
[00:21:13.462 --> 00:21:26.023]  You know, if you don't eat organic food then you're going to get the GMO food, you're going to get all of the things that have been put into there that will impact your body.
[00:21:26.798 --> 00:21:31.341]  And not impacted very well, from a health perspective.
[00:21:31.622 --> 00:21:34.464]  And so the food is being weaponized!
[00:21:48.934 --> 00:21:51.696]  And it's in the Royal Commission on Population, put out by the British they are.
[00:21:51.736 --> 00:21:53.998]  So what the General and the Doctor are saying is the truth.
[00:21:54.338 --> 00:21:59.142]  Amazing interview with General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo and their website.
[00:21:59.182 --> 00:22:01.924]  We've got that up on screen at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:03.345 --> 00:22:04.245]  We're on the march.
[00:22:04.726 --> 00:22:06.327]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:22:07.268 --> 00:22:10.010]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:13.312]  John, let them know we're going to be back in three minutes.
[00:22:15.939 --> 00:22:22.043]  80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[00:22:22.203 --> 00:22:30.247]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[00:22:30.367 --> 00:22:34.889]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[00:22:34.969 --> 00:22:37.590]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:44.454]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized
[00:22:44.714 --> 00:22:49.015]  Phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[00:22:49.275 --> 00:22:55.456]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[00:22:55.696 --> 00:23:03.457]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[00:23:13.086 --> 00:23:15.007]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[00:23:15.047 --> 00:23:17.528]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:23:17.548 --> 00:23:19.689]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:21.370]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.011]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:23:23.091 --> 00:23:25.952]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:23:25.992 --> 00:23:29.614]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:44.174]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:23:45.415 --> 00:23:46.576]  An inside job?
[00:23:47.937 --> 00:23:48.998]  How dare you?
[00:23:50.379 --> 00:23:55.444]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:23:55.464 --> 00:23:57.745]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:23:57.785 --> 00:24:00.228]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[00:24:03.115 --> 00:24:04.758]  Truth Rising.

[00:24:44.884 --> 00:24:45.904]  And so much more.

[00:25:33.939 --> 00:25:39.405]  The entire configuration being designed by the global government, openly announced now, there's no more denial.
[00:25:40.046 --> 00:25:43.209]  Those of us who could see the dots years ago, decades ago, you laughed at us.
[00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:44.991]  Now, it's not even dots.
[00:25:45.492 --> 00:25:47.074]  They just took the mask right off.
[00:25:47.875 --> 00:25:50.698]  And they said, we're coming straight on for humanity.
[00:25:52.844 --> 00:25:53.705]  We don't have a choice.
[00:25:53.805 --> 00:25:55.407]  We have to fight back in any way we can.
[00:25:55.427 --> 00:26:03.035]  And I'm going to ask Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo, from their educated perspective, what we do in that fight.
[00:26:04.056 --> 00:26:07.761]  But let's continue, for those that don't know, with some of the worst things.
[00:26:07.981 --> 00:26:13.287]  Not just the melamine, but the plastics, with the estrogen mimicking, endocrine disruptors.
[00:26:14.007 --> 00:26:23.692]  What the GMO foods are doing, sterilizing, what's being sprayed, the fluoride, the mercury, the arsenic being added by design, and not just fluoride, but all added to the water.
[00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:36.379]  And where you see this all going, as they build up and they mass all of this against us, as they get private armies to protect their own systems, it's clear, as you said General, they're bringing in something hellish.
[00:26:36.399 --> 00:26:40.741]  So both of you, you have the floor, just whatever you think is most important.
[00:26:42.537 --> 00:26:58.308]  Well, let's start with the fact that every bite we take can either add to our health and our vitality or it can diminish our ability to protect ourselves through our immune system and through our regenerative capacity.
[00:26:59.168 --> 00:26:59.929]  I'm a physician.
[00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:03.592]  I have practiced drug-free medicine for the best part of 40 years.
[00:27:04.594 --> 00:27:09.236]  So I'm very, very aware of what nutrition does.
[00:27:09.416 --> 00:27:14.718]  And you've treated to interrupt royalty and heads of state.
[00:27:14.738 --> 00:27:15.999]  But let me see your top position.
[00:27:16.019 --> 00:27:16.339]  Go ahead.
[00:27:18.139 --> 00:27:32.465]  And the reason that royalty, heads of state, people from all over the world came to see us in our practice was that when everything else that conventional medicine has to offer has failed,
[00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:47.715]  People seek the sensible alternatives, and I am, by the way, a physician who believes that the only place that pharmaceuticals have a reason to exist in medicine is in the emergency room.
[00:27:47.815 --> 00:28:01.845]  Beyond that, virtually everything that a pharmaceutical does, dangerously, expensively, and with tremendous side effects, everything can be done by natural methods, by frequency medicine, by nutrition,
[00:28:02.407 --> 00:28:15.172]  By energy medicine and the reason I can say that so confidently is that throughout my entire career I have treated the most difficult patients that anybody can have in their practice.
[00:28:15.212 --> 00:28:24.156]  People who were dying or unable to tolerate meds and in terrible trouble and they came to me and by and large they got well.
[00:28:25.217 --> 00:28:30.759]  Not just symptom free which is all that allopathic medicine has to offer if it
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:44.708]  If it does that well, and usually it doesn't, but truly, radiantly, and in many cases, transcendently well, through giving the body, the heart, the mind, the spirit, what it needs to heal.
[00:28:45.089 --> 00:28:47.770]  What it does not need is toxins.
[00:28:48.471 --> 00:28:58.497]  If you are eating conventional American food, what we call the Standard American Diet, or SAD, you are already eating weaponized food.
[00:28:58.982 --> 00:29:14.193]  I just published an article in one of our blog spots which you can get to by going to our main website healthfreedomusa.org and then clicking on the second button on the left which takes you to the Health Freedom blog.
[00:29:14.253 --> 00:29:28.284]  I just published an article today on the fact that the food supply already contains food grown from seeds which have been irradiated not to prevent
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.681]  I don't know.
[00:29:49.850 --> 00:30:00.378]  They mix it in the food supply and you're eating that mutated food that's different from genetic modification and if that isn't weaponizing food
[00:30:00.916 --> 00:30:02.898]  And I don't know what is.
[00:30:04.018 --> 00:30:04.779]  And they're open air.
[00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:05.539]  Can you speak to this?
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.481]  And then the General wants to come and pop in.
[00:30:08.622 --> 00:30:23.332]  They are open air planting thousands of varieties of x-rayed and gamma-rayed and cross-species plant varieties which are cousins to all these other plants and it's openly jumping in to all the other crops.
[00:30:23.392 --> 00:30:24.093]  That's on record.
[00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:25.233]  Absolutely.
[00:30:25.534 --> 00:30:26.174]  Absolutely.
[00:30:26.254 --> 00:30:27.255]  And they are also
[00:30:27.916 --> 00:30:38.560]  Openly, the United States Department of Agriculture is in the process, in these last lame-duck disastrous days of deregulating everything in the world that the U.S.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:51.906]  government can, is in the process of essentially eliminating any controls or regulations on the outdoor growth and therefore the genetic mixing of genetically modified plants.
[00:30:51.926 --> 00:30:52.166]  Dear God!
[00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:52.606]  That means
[00:30:55.595 --> 00:31:18.207]  That, for instance, foods that are genetically altered to produce industrial chemicals or pharmaceuticals will be allowed to mix their DNA with everything else, not just other food crops of the same species, but food crops of other species and weeds, and they get into insects, and they get into animals that eat them that we eat.
[00:31:18.708 --> 00:31:21.809]  We're talking about food Armageddon.
[00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:22.710]  Now,
[00:31:23.365 --> 00:31:25.546]  That's not acceptable to me.
[00:31:25.606 --> 00:31:29.186]  We're talking about intentionally despoiling the Earth.
[00:31:29.666 --> 00:31:40.529]  And if anybody doubts that it's intentional, all they need to do is go to your data, Alex, or go to our data on our website, healthfreedomusa.org.
[00:31:40.869 --> 00:31:49.931]  We have something called the GMO files in our Health Freedom blog, and there's an abundance of truly horrifying independent science.
[00:31:50.393 --> 00:31:52.273]  This is designed to kill.
[00:31:52.393 --> 00:31:53.814]  This is designed to maim.
[00:31:53.874 --> 00:31:56.274]  This is designed to weaken the immune system.
[00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:59.515]  And this is designed to cause infertility.
[00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:04.436]  Now, if that's what you want for yourself, then that's fine.
[00:32:04.696 --> 00:32:05.296]  Do nothing.
[00:32:05.436 --> 00:32:07.316]  Continue to eat processed food.
[00:32:07.656 --> 00:32:16.118]  Continue to be a person with a slave mentality and be amused by the deceit of the mainstream media.
[00:32:16.158 --> 00:32:18.259]  Just to add a question here to both of you.
[00:32:20.914 --> 00:32:40.076]  I've had Nobel Prize winning geneticists on, I've had top scientists, I mean these are people that were running multi-billion dollar companies, and they'll talk about how if you change one gene in a rat, or one gene in a tomato, or one gene in a pig, it randomly, you get the change you want, but it randomly changes thousands of other things and they admit
[00:32:40.757 --> 00:32:49.387]  That the German studies killing the honeybees with just one form of GMO corn that has a pesticide grown naturally in it so other bugs won't eat it but the honeybees will.
[00:32:49.668 --> 00:32:56.035]  Then they feed us those pesticides that are secreted in the corn naturally as you know but for audience listening
[00:32:56.516 --> 00:33:00.298]  You know, they talk about global warming and climate change and world taxes.
[00:33:00.738 --> 00:33:07.841]  That's a red herring to divert everybody off of all the genetic manipulation of the very biosphere of the planet.
[00:33:07.861 --> 00:33:10.482]  I mean, when you say Armageddon, you're not kidding.
[00:33:10.863 --> 00:33:12.783]  Already most of the... I'm not kidding.
[00:33:13.104 --> 00:33:15.225]  Already most of the live oaks are dying in Texas.
[00:33:15.485 --> 00:33:16.485]  The bees are all dying.
[00:33:16.505 --> 00:33:17.526]  There's hardly any birds.
[00:33:17.566 --> 00:33:18.466]  Everything's dying.
[00:33:19.126 --> 00:33:19.547]  Go ahead.
[00:33:21.007 --> 00:33:23.108]  I wouldn't call it Armageddon.
[00:33:23.208 --> 00:33:24.689]  I would say that there's a war.
[00:33:25.379 --> 00:33:28.059]  I mean, this is a war that we're in.
[00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:33.420]  And as a war, you must take action.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:40.322]  You cannot, you cannot sit back and not do anything unless you want to be a slave.
[00:33:40.982 --> 00:33:41.462]  Or dead.
[00:33:41.722 --> 00:33:43.302]  Yeah, well, they're not even wanting to enslave us!
[00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:45.262]  Choose.
[00:33:45.863 --> 00:33:46.803]  Slave or dead.
[00:33:46.923 --> 00:33:53.564]  Well, I think that in previous wars, the idea was to capture the population and
[00:33:54.691 --> 00:33:56.471]  Use it for your own purposes.
[00:33:56.692 --> 00:33:58.552]  This war... But they were called slaves.
[00:33:58.612 --> 00:33:59.492]  They were called serfs.
[00:33:59.572 --> 00:34:00.232]  You're right.
[00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:01.553]  They were called serfs.
[00:34:01.673 --> 00:34:02.813]  This is genocide, though.
[00:34:02.833 --> 00:34:04.993]  This war is a genocidal war.
[00:34:05.033 --> 00:34:13.595]  There will be a few serfs, but with mechanized labor-saving devices, with machines, with cyborgs.
[00:34:13.916 --> 00:34:15.676]  We don't need very many serfs.
[00:34:16.116 --> 00:34:23.258]  What they are going to want to do, and we were told this by a head of state whom we were treating in our practice.
[00:34:23.338 --> 00:34:24.118]  I mentioned this on
[00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:26.567]  The radio a couple of days ago with you, Alex.
[00:34:26.967 --> 00:34:47.723]  This woman is a head of state, and she said that she had been raised to believe that the useless leaders of the earth, that's us, our children, our friends, our family, our loved ones, were consuming their, that's the master classes, non-renewable resources.
[00:34:48.183 --> 00:34:51.746]  And I said, and therefore they had to be eliminated, and the time was coming
[00:34:52.148 --> 00:34:54.148]  When that would finally be accomplished.
[00:34:54.228 --> 00:34:54.788]  This was in 2002.
[00:34:57.049 --> 00:35:04.410]  I believe that we are now at that next phase and the tools have been put in place.
[00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:21.273]  The fear is being marshaled, managed and very much manipulated to quell the populace and the genocidal weaponization of food, of vaccines, of
[00:35:21.892 --> 00:35:33.142]  Medicine has all been put in place to enact this final cleansing so that we do not use up their non-renewable resources.
[00:35:33.162 --> 00:35:33.982]  Let me stop you there.
[00:35:34.803 --> 00:35:46.773]  Then people say, well, they're destroying the Earth's biosphere in the name of saving it, but they say, what you read earlier is what the head of Sun Microsystems and others have said, the elite plan to kill the majority of us and then have a small group
[00:35:47.614 --> 00:36:15.815]  With this whole technological system, this is the official UN plan, and I want the General to comment on it after you do, but my question here, that's why they're creating all the governmental seed banks, the ARCs, because they plan to release all these plagues, then quote, manage it, claiming they're fighting it, use that as the pretext to basically exterminate the majority of us, and then they think they're going to put the genie back in the bottle, but the geneticists and the engineers I talked to, they say it probably can't be put back in, so at the final equation,
[00:36:17.395 --> 00:36:25.198]  They are completely insane, though they are intelligently insane, with kind of a dark logic or... General, what would you call that?
[00:36:27.299 --> 00:36:28.219]  I'd call it stupid.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.401]  It's very simple.
[00:36:34.641 --> 00:36:36.121]  You know, I'm a simple guy.
[00:36:37.102 --> 00:36:39.322]  I think that it's crazy.
[00:36:39.462 --> 00:36:43.404]  I mean, you know, food as a weapon is not new.
[00:36:45.329 --> 00:36:53.051]  You know, did a scorched earth policy during the Civil War when he was down in Georgia.
[00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:59.232]  He was trying to kill everybody inside, and he was killing the food.
[00:36:59.272 --> 00:37:00.533]  He was going to kill the people.
[00:37:00.813 --> 00:37:01.673]  I mean, that's what he did.
[00:37:02.353 --> 00:37:14.456]  So this is not new in terms of a way of waging war, except that this now, instead of just burning everything, this has
[00:37:15.307 --> 00:37:25.016]  Genetically modified ingredients which they don't even have a clue which way they're going to jump, which way they're going to go.
[00:37:25.096 --> 00:37:29.800]  We don't know except that we do know it is not going to be good.
[00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:32.151]  For what we, for our bellies.
[00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:41.496]  And they've done, and they've done, they've done, they've done tens of thousands of different ones, and some are going bad, some are going kind of sideways, none of it's good.
[00:37:41.516 --> 00:37:45.478]  And some are going to make people infertile so that there won't be any kids.
[00:37:45.898 --> 00:37:46.338]  Exactly.
[00:37:46.358 --> 00:37:56.303]  I hope all of your listeners, Alex, know about the Austrian study that was released about ten days ago, which shows, pardon me?
[00:37:56.583 --> 00:37:57.464]  Yeah, tell them about the mice.
[00:37:59.715 --> 00:38:13.105]  Two types of corn, NK-603 and MON-810, are ubiquitously approved, even in Europe, for animal feed and for human consumption.
[00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:17.549]  Now these corns, remember when food used to have names?
[00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:20.812]  Well, once it starts to have numbers, you're in big trouble.
[00:38:21.252 --> 00:38:27.437]  These patented types of corn cause infertility in mice.
[00:38:28.035 --> 00:38:29.976]  We're not very different from mice.
[00:38:30.436 --> 00:38:40.178]  If you'll notice, think about when your parents, or when you, if you're older than 20 or 30, started to have children.
[00:38:40.578 --> 00:38:44.760]  You and your friends all became pregnant pretty much when you wanted to.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:56.783]  Well, at this point, the numbers of infertile couples, the number of people who have to go for fertility treatment or never do manage to become parents through biological means,
[00:38:57.287 --> 00:39:09.257]  The number of people who have huge reproductive problems is increasing rapidly, and if anybody thinks that's an accident, they really need to get their head out of the sand.
[00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:25.953]  Doctor, as you know, that's why the main guinea pig they use is mice and rats, because biologically they found that mice, rats, and pigs, with cross-spectrum drugs and tests, are the closest to our metabolic system.
[00:39:26.494 --> 00:39:34.379]  And so, conclusively, in a whole bunch of studies, it's sterilizing mammals that eat all sorts of GMO, and that's clearly being engineered into that.
[00:39:36.781 --> 00:39:45.928]  Now you've mentioned this out of state, and I know for confidentiality reasons you can't get into it, but specifically, flesh it out, was there anything else she said you haven't told us?
[00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:50.952]  Oh yes, she said a great deal that I haven't discussed.
[00:39:51.772 --> 00:39:56.276]  One of the things that she did was bring her children to me, these were grown children,
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:03.341]  To find out whether they had been conditioned through mind control techniques as she believed that she had been.
[00:40:03.381 --> 00:40:08.922]  Now remember, people say, well, she would know whether she was conditioned through mind control techniques.
[00:40:09.042 --> 00:40:09.882]  No, not at all.
[00:40:10.242 --> 00:40:17.584]  Because people have their awareness compartmentalized through the horrific processes that are used.
[00:40:18.064 --> 00:40:24.825]  And many of the things that we call satanic or ritual abuse are in fact mind control
[00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:41.077]  programs that are disguised in a quasi-religion of Satanism, which of course is no religion at all, but is really a political program designed to produce the desired effect in human behavior.
[00:40:41.117 --> 00:40:53.483]  Because after all, just as biology and life are not sacred to these people, so behavior and the essence of humanity that many people call the soul
[00:40:54.019 --> 00:40:55.420]  It's not sacred either.
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:01.003]  And people may say, my God, have they no limit to what they will invade and destroy?
[00:41:01.023 --> 00:41:02.544]  And the answer is no, they have no limit.
[00:41:02.664 --> 00:41:07.426]  Well, I've studied the globalists for a long time and what you're saying is their religion is betrayal.
[00:41:07.486 --> 00:41:12.529]  Their religion is defiling innocence and destroying beauty and hurting the order of things.
[00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:15.811]  They want to remake creation in their own image.
[00:41:16.111 --> 00:41:19.693]  General Stubblebine, I know it's all classified, you can't get into it, but you ran special forces.
[00:41:20.253 --> 00:41:21.354]  You brought that up.
[00:41:21.394 --> 00:41:22.875]  One of the things that very interestingly
[00:41:50.174 --> 00:41:50.795]  Came to me.
[00:41:51.555 --> 00:41:54.958]  I've got to go back into just a very quick bit of history.
[00:41:55.538 --> 00:42:10.009]  When I took over the Intelligence and Security Command, which was my final man, I actually had under me all of the Army's strategic intelligence forces around the world.
[00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:16.294]  Every one of the Army's strategic intelligence forces belonged to me, not the tactical, just the strategic.
[00:42:17.383 --> 00:42:22.467]  But during that period, our resources were going down and our requirements were going up.
[00:42:22.527 --> 00:42:27.051]  So what I did was I put together a thing I called the High Performance Task Force.
[00:42:27.812 --> 00:42:40.103]  Go out and find all of the things that would allow a person to work better, not longer, so that we could still meet our requirements.
[00:42:40.903 --> 00:42:45.187]  Well, out of that came some very fascinating things.
[00:42:45.698 --> 00:43:03.642]  One of which, and this is in this stupid book about staring at goats, one of that items was a thing which could be used if you stared at a goat, it could explode its heart.
[00:43:03.742 --> 00:43:05.342]  Stay there, stay there General.
[00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:07.202]  We've got to talk about, we've got to break.
[00:43:07.222 --> 00:43:07.982]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[00:43:08.002 --> 00:43:10.143]  We'll finish up with this powerful information.
[00:43:10.463 --> 00:43:10.863]  Stay with us.
[00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:14.292]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[00:43:14.472 --> 00:43:15.913]  What does humidity mean to you?
[00:43:16.233 --> 00:43:18.455]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[00:43:18.915 --> 00:43:23.638]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[00:43:24.038 --> 00:43:26.900]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.702]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[00:43:31.129 --> 00:43:43.142]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air, using reverse osmosis, and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system, which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[00:43:43.682 --> 00:43:45.705]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[00:43:46.005 --> 00:43:47.006]  I use one every day.
[00:43:47.426 --> 00:43:49.829]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[00:43:49.889 --> 00:43:50.609]  I think so.
[00:44:12.754 --> 00:44:19.136]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:19.496 --> 00:44:21.477]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:22.137 --> 00:44:23.177]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:23.677 --> 00:44:24.217]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:24.478 --> 00:44:25.298]  This is his ammo.
[00:44:25.438 --> 00:44:26.778]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:26.838 --> 00:44:28.519]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:28.839 --> 00:44:35.601]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:36.421]  Some U.S.
[00:44:36.461 --> 00:44:42.103]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:42.823 --> 00:44:46.304]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:46.324 --> 00:44:49.125]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.302]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.
[00:45:17.642 --> 00:45:23.965]  Our hemp foods are anti-inflammatory and gluten-free and can greatly benefit the health of the human body.
[00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:45.383]  Call 908-691-8000 or visit hempusa.org today.
[00:46:03.396 --> 00:46:05.359]  So don't delay, call today!
[00:46:05.379 --> 00:46:08.284]  908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do for you!
[00:46:16.883 --> 00:46:17.884]  Okay, General.
[00:46:18.804 --> 00:46:20.785]  You were tasked with studying all this.
[00:46:20.825 --> 00:46:21.985]  The Russians were studying it.
[00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:30.450]  So there at Fort Bragg and other places, you had gotten up to the point about some of the experiments with animals.
[00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.030]  Please continue, sir.
[00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:42.555]  What I was talking about was that I had put together this high-performance task force to try to figure out how we could cope with the lack of resources and more requirements.
[00:46:44.386 --> 00:46:48.087]  Many, many different kinds of things, you know, appeared on my desk.
[00:46:48.407 --> 00:46:54.688]  One of which was this ability to use the mind to stare at an animal.
[00:46:54.828 --> 00:46:56.769]  It doesn't need to be a goat, but an animal.
[00:46:57.389 --> 00:47:02.190]  And with mental power, explode the heart.
[00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:06.711]  Well, that was not my responsibility.
[00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:13.973]  My responsibility, and I got to underscore this, Alex, my responsibility was the intelligent side of this thing.
[00:47:15.185 --> 00:47:19.588]  Going out and exploding somebody's heart is the operational side.
[00:47:19.748 --> 00:47:24.511]  That's the G3 instead of the G2 in military policy.
[00:47:25.492 --> 00:47:27.433]  My responsibility was intelligence.
[00:47:27.793 --> 00:47:44.064]  So when this thing appeared on my desk, and it did, there's no doubt about that, what I did was I took it to the Special Forces folks to say, here, this is a technology that you probably need
[00:47:44.699 --> 00:47:45.459]  I think so.
[00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:46.060]  I think so.
[00:48:13.012 --> 00:48:13.432]  Did it work?
[00:48:13.452 --> 00:48:14.472]  I mean is that classified?
[00:48:14.492 --> 00:48:14.753]  I don't know.
[00:48:38.303 --> 00:48:39.263]  I really don't know.
[00:48:39.703 --> 00:48:39.983]  Do I?
[00:48:40.003 --> 00:48:40.043]  No.
[00:48:41.064 --> 00:48:42.984]  Let me turn it a different way.
[00:48:43.724 --> 00:48:44.865]  Do I believe it worked?
[00:48:45.165 --> 00:48:45.425]  Yes.
[00:48:46.665 --> 00:48:48.106]  Do I know that it worked?
[00:48:48.426 --> 00:48:48.706]  No.
[00:48:48.906 --> 00:48:55.248]  Because I never tried it myself and I never saw any goat that ended up dead.
[00:48:56.908 --> 00:49:02.309]  However, I did see a number of testimonials that said that that worked.
[00:49:02.469 --> 00:49:03.110]  From the Army?
[00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:04.410]  Yep.
[00:49:05.157 --> 00:49:06.638]  Special Forces said it was working.
[00:49:06.998 --> 00:49:22.327]  They're not normally the type to just make things up internally, but I mean the point is, this has been on the TV, on mainstream TV, that the Russians believed all this, and is that, I know you can't get into intelligence, but I would imagine that's where this intelligence came from, so the Army tested it and tried to see if it was real.
[00:49:24.168 --> 00:49:29.271]  Well, incidentally, I don't have any problem believing that it worked.
[00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:33.273]  I do have, I cannot say that,
[00:49:33.792 --> 00:49:36.793]  Because I have no direct information.
[00:49:36.893 --> 00:49:41.315]  I wasn't there, I didn't see it, I haven't seen one explode.
[00:49:42.376 --> 00:49:49.199]  So, other than testimonials, I don't know capability.
[00:49:49.259 --> 00:49:50.820]  But Bragg is saying it worked.
[00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:53.441]  Yes.
[00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:56.242]  Or at least that's my understanding, yes.
[00:49:57.762 --> 00:49:59.763]  Well, we've kind of gotten off the track there, but that's interesting.
[00:49:59.803 --> 00:50:05.265]  So that gets into what these elites believe and some of the things that's going on just in that little window that you saw into.
[00:50:05.285 --> 00:50:06.886]  We're going to break and start the final hour.
[00:50:06.906 --> 00:50:12.088]  I want to get into solutions with you guys and why you guys have moved to Panama.
[00:50:12.128 --> 00:50:17.770]  You're trying to teach folks how to grow organically, then export the technology all over the world so people can get ready.
[00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:20.171]  Dr. Labo has talked a lot about this.
[00:50:21.532 --> 00:50:25.694]  You guys had a very successful practice in all sorts of organizations and foundations here in the U.S.
[00:50:26.055 --> 00:50:31.738]  So I'll ask you when we get back in one minute or 70 seconds, technically, why you decided to go down to Panama.
[00:50:32.119 --> 00:50:35.541]  Last time I talked to you a year ago or so, you guys were still coming back to the U.S.
[00:50:35.561 --> 00:50:35.801]  some.
[00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:36.502]  Now you're not.
[00:50:36.942 --> 00:50:43.486]  And we've got to talk about what happened at the Codex Alimentarius meeting a few months ago that you covered in Europe as well.
[00:50:43.566 --> 00:50:47.489]  So our amazing guest with us for one more hour straight ahead.
[00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:50.651]  Healthfreedomusa.org is their website.
[00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:53.675]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:51:03.032 --> 00:51:05.574]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:51:05.895 --> 00:51:07.176]  Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:51:07.456 --> 00:51:09.458]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:09.618 --> 00:51:11.359]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.741]  The late, great USA.
[00:51:13.001 --> 00:51:14.422]  America, freedom to fascism.
[00:51:14.762 --> 00:51:21.608]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[00:52:05.493 --> 00:52:07.394]  Waging war on corruption!
[00:52:07.854 --> 00:52:10.655]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network!
[00:52:24.184 --> 00:52:34.388]  All right, we're now into the final hour of this quick five-minute segment, but a long segment, coming up with both of our guests joining us.
[00:52:34.808 --> 00:52:41.251]  My website's InfoWars.com, of course, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, their site's HealthFreedomUSA.org.
[00:52:41.371 --> 00:52:43.091]  We're going to put that up on the screen.
[00:52:43.652 --> 00:52:47.833]  Again, we're now live at PrisonPlanet.tv, been live for the last 55 minutes.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:56.004]  And we are talking to Major General Albert Burt N. Stubblebine, the third U.S.
[00:52:56.044 --> 00:52:56.704]  Army retired.
[00:52:56.724 --> 00:52:59.266]  You can read his bio at healthfreedomusa.org.
[00:52:59.666 --> 00:53:04.690]  And his wife, Rima E. LeBeau, M.D., graduate of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
[00:53:06.272 --> 00:53:07.373]  There's so much to get into.
[00:53:07.854 --> 00:53:12.277]  Perhaps we should get a report from you guys about going to Codex Alimentarius' U.N.
[00:53:12.297 --> 00:53:15.659]  meeting and what it is and how they're trying to block our access.
[00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:16.459]  Here's an example.
[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:20.522]  Toronto bans bottled water sales, but junk sodas remain legal.
[00:53:21.203 --> 00:53:22.063]  That's natural news.
[00:53:22.123 --> 00:53:24.805]  Mike Adams, that you guys work some with, another great guy.
[00:53:26.967 --> 00:53:29.669]  Again, if they can ban bottled water, they can start banning other foods.
[00:53:30.149 --> 00:53:31.810]  This is setting precedence.
[00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:32.971]  Tell us what's going on with that.
[00:53:34.738 --> 00:53:44.143]  Well, what's going on with that is that Codex Alimentarius is designed to make it impossible to get healthy food anywhere.
[00:53:44.763 --> 00:53:48.685]  And the reason that we came to Panama is directly related to that.
[00:53:48.865 --> 00:54:01.091]  And indeed, General Stubblebine and I have been met at gunpoint in a public meeting, a Codex Alimentarius Commission meeting, which is their annual big meeting where they ratify the harm
[00:54:01.533 --> 00:54:01.813]  That's good.
[00:54:18.743 --> 00:54:21.144]  She's talking about when they came to get us.
[00:54:21.504 --> 00:54:25.004]  And this is not something that other observers were treated to.
[00:54:25.024 --> 00:54:25.925]  None.
[00:54:26.385 --> 00:54:26.645]  None.
[00:54:26.945 --> 00:54:28.685]  We were sequestered.
[00:54:29.505 --> 00:54:46.069]  The main meeting room had about 180 empty seats and we were in the fourth floor gallery way up above with a guard at the door and anytime either one of us tried to go to the bathroom or to get lunch or whatever, we were followed by the guards.
[00:54:46.476 --> 00:54:46.616]  Okay.
[00:55:01.795 --> 00:55:03.877]  To ordinary unarmed citizens?
[00:55:03.917 --> 00:55:11.883]  There were only a hundred extra seats, and we were told that there were no extra seats, so we had to go to the upper balcony.
[00:55:11.923 --> 00:55:15.706]  But why did they choose to do that, to perpetrate that lie?
[00:55:15.747 --> 00:55:18.329]  Well, obviously because we're being very, very effective.
[00:55:18.389 --> 00:55:28.517]  Now, at the last Codex meeting that we attended, we were able to galvanize the African nations in their
[00:55:30.342 --> 00:55:38.609]  Their opposition to having GM food and feed brushed down their throats to kill them, to sterilize them, and so on, because they know the score.
[00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:55.043]  Tragically, the last Codex meeting that we wanted to attend, which was in South Africa at the beginning of November, dealt very much with the issue of genetically modified food and toxins for babies and for sick people.
[00:55:55.784 --> 00:55:58.086]  And when we have attended these meetings,
[00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:15.082]  We've been able to achieve striking positive forward movement like banning fluoride from formula for normal infants through our efforts at the same committee meeting in Thailand two years ago.
[00:56:15.562 --> 00:56:22.307]  That was an incredible victory that was brought about by presenting science and by using the
[00:56:23.163 --> 00:56:37.414]  Coalition of the Unwilling that we have spent years creating at this last meeting of the same committee, the Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses, that was meeting in November in South Africa that I mentioned, we weren't there.
[00:56:37.754 --> 00:56:38.815]  Why weren't we there?
[00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:51.484]  Because the economic crisis had hit and our donations had plummeted to the point where we literally could not afford the airfare, we could not afford the hotel, we could not afford
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:59.283]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:56:59.383 --> 00:57:01.344]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:57:22.307 --> 00:57:23.348]  But who is the enemy?
[00:57:23.848 --> 00:57:24.388]  Bin Laden.
[00:57:24.648 --> 00:57:25.669]  This is his M.O.
[00:57:25.689 --> 00:57:26.950]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.711]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:57:29.011 --> 00:57:35.755]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:57:36.155 --> 00:57:36.595]  Some U.S.
[00:57:36.635 --> 00:57:42.319]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:57:42.999 --> 00:57:46.442]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:49.284]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:58:12.797 --> 00:58:15.178]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:58:15.819 --> 00:58:20.061]  Did you know that the United Nations has never fulfilled its sole goal for existing?
[00:58:20.622 --> 00:58:21.842]  Maintaining world peace?
[00:58:22.423 --> 00:58:23.343]  Do you know why?
[00:58:23.523 --> 00:58:25.865]  Everywhere they've been involved, it becomes worse.

[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:51.804]  Did you know the rogue nations and terrorist organizations have been purchasing suitcase nuclear bombs on the black market?
[00:58:52.585 --> 00:58:53.985]  Will they use them on America?

[01:00:14.415 --> 01:00:20.437]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:21.057 --> 01:00:24.038]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:40.836]  All right, Dr. Rima Labo is our guest M.D., and of course, Major General Albert Stubblebine, the former head of Army Special Forces and the head of Army Intelligence.
[01:00:42.677 --> 01:00:45.118]  We're honored to have them both with us today.
[01:00:45.678 --> 01:01:01.723]  You were continuing, Dr. Lebo, to walk through the fact that, yeah, I have books, videos, products, advertising that funds my operation, and I have to spend most of my time, and I'm not whining about it, trying to raise money just to then have the money, you know, to do the broadcast, do the websites, make the films.
[01:01:01.763 --> 01:01:05.725]  And I understand this capitalization issue, and you guys have dropped everything the last
[01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:06.785]  Absolutely.
[01:01:06.805 --> 01:01:08.486]  Bert and I closed our medical practice.
[01:01:31.061 --> 01:01:41.363]  Which did supply us with an income and allowed us to have a lovely home and do the things that we enjoy doing, skiing and dancing and so on.
[01:01:41.783 --> 01:01:52.125]  Because this is a war and there is great evil afoot and those who stand by while evil is being perpetrated become perpetrators themselves.
[01:01:52.185 --> 01:01:54.485]  That motivates you Alex, it motivates us.
[01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:56.706]  So we closed our practice in late 2004.
[01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.272]  And we created the Natural Solutions Foundation.
[01:02:01.772 --> 01:02:16.101]  We created a website, healthfreedomusa.org, and then we applied the strategic and analytical skills that we used so successfully in our prior careers.
[01:02:16.361 --> 01:02:24.647]  Bert is a general involved in strategic intelligence, and I as a physician treating cases where nothing else had worked.
[01:02:24.687 --> 01:02:26.888]  And by the way, the official medical phrase
[01:02:27.372 --> 01:02:33.176]  When something hasn't worked is that, and you'll love this, the patient has failed therapy.
[01:02:33.556 --> 01:02:37.978]  Not that therapy has failed the patient, but that the patient has failed therapy.
[01:02:38.799 --> 01:02:43.962]  We closed that in order to take on this global health freedom problem.
[01:02:44.622 --> 01:02:55.249]  And one of the things that I do very well as a diagnostician in medicine is look at the whole picture and find the basic underlying
[01:02:56.138 --> 01:02:56.758]  I don't know.
[01:02:56.778 --> 01:02:57.099]  I don't know.
[01:03:24.662 --> 01:03:32.065]  And the murder of the constitutional body politic in the United States and elsewhere.
[01:03:32.085 --> 01:03:46.552]  I said, OK, what is the single central item here which has to be reclaimed, redefined and put back into the hands of people in order to fix the whole damn system?
[01:03:47.092 --> 01:03:49.313]  And the answer is food.
[01:03:50.674 --> 01:03:53.395]  Steel controls the world, food controls
[01:03:53.976 --> 01:03:54.597]  The world.
[01:03:55.077 --> 01:04:01.082]  That is the system that is being used at the center of world domination.
[01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:08.208]  I don't know whether other people have identified this crucial issue or not, but the fact is, that's our analysis.
[01:04:08.688 --> 01:04:19.797]  And so, we created the International Decade of Nutrition, the IDN, as part of the work of the Natural Solutions Foundation.
[01:04:20.218 --> 01:04:23.060]  And we said, we need to return the production of food
[01:04:23.499 --> 01:04:42.491]  To the people, to the farmers, so they can feed their community themselves and their social system can remain intact and not driven off their land by the multinational corporations, so that they go to the cities, become the abjectly poor, starve and die.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:50.066]  Uh, but instead become what they have always been, the people who essentially hold up society with food.
[01:04:50.166 --> 01:04:57.933]  And that's what globalization, by the way, by design, as you know, Dr. Leibo and General Sullivan, for the audience that may not, Agenda 21, all of this states
[01:04:58.513 --> 01:04:59.314]  Force the people.
[01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:00.895]  Take Mexico as a microcosm.
[01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:06.438]  Over the last 30 years, they forced the indigenous people off their cornfields where they've been for thousands of years.
[01:05:06.478 --> 01:05:07.919]  They forced them into Mexico City.
[01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:09.600]  Now 35 million people.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.783]  Around a third of the children born with a syndrome where they have the tiny brain.
[01:05:14.383 --> 01:05:15.283]  Zombies, basically.
[01:05:15.424 --> 01:05:16.124]  They never even develop.
[01:05:16.144 --> 01:05:16.604]  They die.
[01:05:16.965 --> 01:05:21.888]  That's been a staging ground to move them to the United States to then drive down wages and break down
[01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:23.539]  The system here.
[01:05:23.879 --> 01:05:29.261]  Globalization is a war against the middle class and against the poor by the elite.
[01:05:29.362 --> 01:05:32.583]  And people need to go to your website, donate, support it.
[01:05:32.643 --> 01:05:33.903]  I think it's very worthwhile.
[01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:42.386]  But also spread the word about what you're doing and take the materials you've developed and deploy that with these natural systems of growing.
[01:05:42.707 --> 01:05:45.228]  I mean, you've developed some wonderful systems.
[01:05:45.268 --> 01:05:50.350]  So let's talk about some of those as well and then get General Stubblebine to chime in.
[01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:51.410]  But please continue.
[01:05:52.608 --> 01:06:02.979]  Let me suggest, thank you Alex, let me suggest that people go to our website and view a video there called Nutricide, N-U-T-R-I-C-I-D-E.
[01:06:03.299 --> 01:06:11.507]  This is of extreme importance, and by the way Alex, we have to work out a way that you can carry this as part of the wonderful information that you disseminate.
[01:06:13.209 --> 01:06:15.972]  This Nutricide talks about the fact that
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:25.984]  This food genocide came out of World War II when the Nazi genocide failed and it's tied intimately to the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:06:26.405 --> 01:06:37.650]  To go on, we decided that we had to demonstrate that it was possible to end world hunger and therefore eliminate 90% of world disease.
[01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:39.271]  And let me very quickly deal with the
[01:06:39.722 --> 01:06:41.143]  Overpopulation issue.
[01:06:41.203 --> 01:06:43.484]  People say, yeah, but there really are too many people.
[01:06:43.944 --> 01:06:58.251]  The surest, quickest, and most efficient way to bring down the birth rate on a voluntary basis and enhance the quality of life in the community is to educate women, not to sterilize men and women.
[01:06:58.311 --> 01:07:01.112]  So we're talking about an alternative there.
[01:07:01.532 --> 01:07:07.876]  Women need to be educated, and that works in every culture, whether it's Muslim or Christian or Atheist or whatever.
[01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:16.098]  We decided that we needed to reclaim the production of food and demonstrate that it was possible to eliminate world hunger.
[01:07:16.418 --> 01:07:25.961]  We have some astounding technologies which have absolutely no environmental downside, but can increase food production by up to 600%.
[01:07:27.682 --> 01:07:32.043]  Can increase nutrient density in food by up to 600%.
[01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:35.705]  That is simple to use.
[01:07:35.745 --> 01:07:37.666]  You don't have to put in electricity.
[01:07:37.686 --> 01:07:39.466]  You don't have to be able to read and write.
[01:07:39.886 --> 01:07:44.347]  We're teaching farmers, or we intend to teach farmers, exactly how to do that.
[01:07:44.707 --> 01:08:02.431]  At the same time, we intend to, by working with Father Godfrey Ntamadjou from Benin, Africa, create an educational system here in Panama where we can teach farmers how to farm without pollution and how to create their own energy supply
[01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:09.587]  Through methane digestion, using the waste of the farm, human waste, animal waste, and agricultural waste.
[01:08:10.247 --> 01:08:17.130]  We don't need petroleum to have light, to have energy to run our cars.
[01:08:17.831 --> 01:08:19.992]  Absolutely irrelevant.
[01:08:20.412 --> 01:08:29.496]  Besides the fact that it's so damaging economically and environmentally, we can teach farmers how to bring that to their communities.
[01:08:29.977 --> 01:08:33.798]  So we came to Panama, and we selected Panama for many, many reasons.
[01:08:33.858 --> 01:08:48.483]  And by the way, the place on the planet most likely to weather this economic cataclysm that's been delivered to us and will get worse and worse, we believe, the place best suited for stability economically is Panama.
[01:08:48.743 --> 01:08:49.623]  Very interesting.
[01:08:50.663 --> 01:08:56.245]  At the same time, we did not choose the hot, sticky areas of Panama.
[01:08:57.536 --> 01:09:25.559]  We chose the highlands of Panama, temperate, beautiful, bountiful, year-long, spring-like weather, which means we have a 365-day growing season, and the foundation, Natural Solutions Foundation, has been able to purchase a piece of land that currently has two houses and will house a natural medical center and a series of teaching facilities, and
[01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:33.199]  Uh, a farm with five commercial greenhouses on it which will allow us to protect against
[01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:36.900]  Genetically modified genetic drift.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.445]  And by the way, as you know, a lot of other people are getting concerned and trying to do similar things.
[01:09:42.505 --> 01:09:53.254]  People, not just from the alternative media, but instinctively are moving out to farms, moving out to homesteads, are getting heirloom seeds, are getting ready.
[01:09:53.294 --> 01:09:57.238]  So I commend the research you're doing because that's going to help so many people.
[01:09:57.278 --> 01:09:58.659]  So folks that want to find out more?
[01:09:59.519 --> 01:09:59.980]  Absolutely.
[01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.142]  They better be thinking about it, and better be taking action.
[01:10:03.182 --> 01:10:13.048]  Not just thinking about it, they need to take action, Alex, because if they don't, they're going to be missing the food that they need to sustain themselves.
[01:10:13.068 --> 01:10:16.531]  Well, General, what would... Not everybody can move to a farm, Alex.
[01:10:16.691 --> 01:10:18.252]  Victory Gardens.
[01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:20.193]  Absolutely.
[01:10:20.353 --> 01:10:27.718]  Now, I don't know how many of your listeners remember the Victory Gardens, or have read about the Victory Gardens of World War II, but in order to
[01:10:28.374 --> 01:10:41.521]  Um, save petroleum in order to save labor in order to, um, allow people to continue to work in the, um, uh, in the industries that were producing the war machine.
[01:10:41.541 --> 01:10:50.206]  Um, people were told that they needed to grow their own food and that would help speed the victory against the enemy, the Germans and the Japanese.
[01:10:50.306 --> 01:10:52.407]  And indeed people did grow their own food.
[01:10:52.447 --> 01:10:56.549]  They created what were called victory gardens and they remembered again,
[01:10:57.162 --> 01:11:01.446]  Even urbanized people remembered again how to grow their own food.
[01:11:01.486 --> 01:11:03.868]  Well, we need Victory Gardens on steroids.
[01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:05.190]  And it's also fun.
[01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.791]  I'll tell you what's happening in Austin.
[01:11:06.831 --> 01:11:12.656]  A lot of people are going out to pieces of property, two, three, four acres and just growing masses of food.
[01:11:13.617 --> 01:11:21.663]  I know one fellow from his grandparents gave him, I think it's like 20 acres, the middle of town, and he's got a huge garden there with two growing seasons a year.
[01:11:22.224 --> 01:11:25.306]  And so, absolutely, this is what humans are designed to do.
[01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:28.188]  So I hope folks will visit healthfreedomusa.org.
[01:11:28.468 --> 01:11:37.115]  They can sign up for your news alerts and information, they can get the videos and materials there on the site, and that will certainly support them.
[01:11:37.195 --> 01:11:38.796]  We invite people to come visit.
[01:11:39.232 --> 01:11:51.462]  We invite people to come learn because we're going to be teaching urban people how to grow enough food to feed a family of four in four feet of square foot space.
[01:11:51.962 --> 01:11:59.668]  Four square feet can feed a family of four fresh vegetables for an entire year with virtually no cost.
[01:11:59.688 --> 01:12:02.010]  You can do that in your apartment with a couple of grow lights.
[01:12:02.455 --> 01:12:04.739]  This is something that every single person can do.
[01:12:04.759 --> 01:12:06.642]  We'll be launching a new newsletter.
[01:12:06.782 --> 01:12:07.323]  Okay, stay there.
[01:12:07.343 --> 01:12:07.884]  We've got a break.
[01:12:07.904 --> 01:12:08.545]  We've got a break.
[01:12:09.346 --> 01:12:11.910]  And in fact, we'll probably just skip this break, but here we go.
[01:12:13.733 --> 01:12:16.518]  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and skip this break, John.
[01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:18.433]  For the internet only audience.
[01:12:19.053 --> 01:12:22.295]  Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine, we're going to be back to the full audience in a couple minutes.
[01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:36.124]  I want to now shift gears, and I understand getting prepared, getting ready is the way to go, but obviously you know videos are the way to really educate the whole world who can't come to Panama, and I know you guys have produced some great documentaries and talks.
[01:12:36.605 --> 01:12:40.607]  Are you planning to make some videos about what you're showing and doing down there?
[01:12:41.974 --> 01:12:42.474]  You bet.
[01:12:42.774 --> 01:12:49.257]  And as a matter of fact, if you want to co-op that one, if you want to collaborate on that, Alex, I'd be thrilled.
[01:12:49.897 --> 01:12:50.577]  Well, I'd love to.
[01:12:50.597 --> 01:12:53.518]  And I'm always pinned down here, putting out a million different fires.
[01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:56.840]  But, you know, I wouldn't mind coming down and seeing your operation in Panama.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.880]  I've never... We'd love to have you.
[01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.581]  I've been down to Central America, but I've never been to Panama.
[01:13:02.282 --> 01:13:04.102]  So... We'd love to have you, Alex.
[01:13:04.582 --> 01:13:05.123]  Absolutely.
[01:13:06.584 --> 01:13:11.628]  Well, what I'll do then is I'll certainly try to figure out some time to get down there before everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[01:13:11.949 --> 01:13:20.456]  You know, I envy you guys being up there in the mountain rainforest, because I'm right here in the... Beautiful.
[01:13:21.817 --> 01:13:22.858]  I bet it is magnificent.
[01:13:23.178 --> 01:13:26.221]  The facility here is almost beyond imagining.
[01:13:26.241 --> 01:13:29.043]  You stick anything in the ground and it flourishes.
[01:13:30.784 --> 01:13:34.988]  Unfortunately, even though it's illegal in Panama, the government of Panama is
[01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:39.091]  releasing genetically modified organisms at a ferocious cost.
[01:13:39.251 --> 01:13:45.393]  I have compiled a dossier on that and have presented it to a number of people that I thought might be able to do something about it.
[01:13:45.553 --> 01:13:46.874]  That is my next question.
[01:13:48.254 --> 01:13:49.215]  We'll be back in two minutes.
[01:13:49.355 --> 01:13:56.557]  I want to get into that area because I was going to ask you about Brazil and Panama and Africa and even in the U.S.
[01:13:56.937 --> 01:13:57.577]  and Canada.
[01:13:57.618 --> 01:13:58.198]  They've caught them.
[01:13:58.218 --> 01:14:01.319]  This has been in major news, as you know, for the audience, where
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:12.413]  Companies are putting their seeds out, planting their test fields next to major farming growth belts of similar crops to contaminate everything.
[01:14:12.473 --> 01:14:13.554]  And I want to talk about that agenda.
[01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.517]  And General Stubblebine can speak to this.
[01:14:15.577 --> 01:14:16.218]  Take Iraq.
[01:14:18.118 --> 01:14:22.865]  One of the first things they did was make the Iraqis only take GMO crops.
[01:14:23.345 --> 01:14:24.086]  That's right.
[01:14:24.567 --> 01:14:26.630]  Exactly right.
[01:14:27.992 --> 01:14:31.156]  I recall it's in their constitution that that's the only thing they can use.
[01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:39.665]  Reading the IMF and World Bank documents, the UN Biological Diversity Assessments and others, they admit this is a weapon.
[01:14:39.705 --> 01:14:40.887]  This isn't even denied.
[01:14:41.287 --> 01:14:49.276]  And so it's all about destroying these ancient cultures, these ancient varieties, making these countries dependent when only GMO is in their country.
[01:14:49.336 --> 01:14:54.701]  So, and I know you guys know this better than I do, but for the audience, some may not know it, let's walk through
[01:14:55.542 --> 01:14:58.905]  What they're doing in Iraq, what they're doing in Africa, what you've caught them doing in Panama.
[01:14:59.425 --> 01:15:06.870]  I know in Brazil, it's super illegal, but they go in spending money to contaminate things and why that's so important.
[01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.371]  We'll be back in one minute, okay?
[01:15:09.572 --> 01:15:10.012]  Here we go.
[01:15:10.253 --> 01:15:13.815]  I'm Steve Shank.
[01:15:14.436 --> 01:15:20.560]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:31.525]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen inactive like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:32.906]  Well, snap out of it.
[01:15:32.946 --> 01:15:33.946]  We now have a deadline.
[01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:35.926]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:47.769]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[01:15:48.353 --> 01:15:54.057]  Well, I take the general at his word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:59.381]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:15:59.941 --> 01:16:03.724]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[01:16:04.284 --> 01:16:08.867]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:16:14.211 --> 01:16:15.912]  He's going the distance.
[01:16:15.952 --> 01:16:17.173]  He's going for speed.
[01:16:37.805 --> 01:16:38.307]  Yeah!
[01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:42.378]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:43.721 --> 01:16:45.827]  Got about 40 minutes left with our guest.
[01:16:47.133 --> 01:16:49.154]  I guess 36 minutes would be technical.
[01:16:49.554 --> 01:17:02.518]  I want to take a few calls for our guests, specifically on Codex Alimentaria, specifically on GMO, the poisons, the toxins in the food, coming up in the next final segments at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:17:03.158 --> 01:17:08.420]  Next on my list, I had Iraq forcing them in their constitution to only grow GMO.
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:10.541]  I mean, that's tyranny right there.
[01:17:10.621 --> 01:17:14.582]  Even if GMO was quote, good, why make them only buy it from Monsanto?
[01:17:15.182 --> 01:17:16.923]  Well, in Iraq, they couldn't even save their native seeds.
[01:17:17.043 --> 01:17:17.903]  In other words, they had to use
[01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.331]  The GMO.
[01:17:42.611 --> 01:17:52.422]  I mean, it's absolutely crazy when you tell a person that it's illegal to save his seed from his last crop so that he can grow the next one.
[01:17:52.923 --> 01:17:54.004]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:17:54.385 --> 01:17:57.848]  And that's what they, then, they give them nothing but the GMO.
[01:17:58.129 --> 01:18:00.111]  So now they're totally dependent upon the GMO.
[01:18:01.485 --> 01:18:03.887]  The first year, a lot of times, they give it to them free.
[01:18:04.207 --> 01:18:21.041]  The next year, of course, they have to pay for it, and of course they don't have enough money to pay for it, so now they're destitute and off their farm, and the large commercial outfits have taken over all of the little tiny farmers plots.
[01:18:21.722 --> 01:18:29.408]  So, if you think that that isn't just excruciating to watch, and we have seen it in India over and over and over again,
[01:18:30.014 --> 01:18:30.294]  We're
[01:18:43.814 --> 01:18:45.396]  I've literally seen it in India.
[01:19:03.257 --> 01:19:04.899]  Well, it's not crazy or evil, though.
[01:19:04.979 --> 01:19:06.800]  I mean, out in the open, and then here it is.
[01:19:07.421 --> 01:19:11.244]  Toronto bans bottled water sales citywide, but junk sodas remain legal.
[01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.586]  Again, they want you drinking the fluoride water.
[01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:21.733]  But again, the precedent of telling Canadians, and now San Francisco is trying it, you can't drink the water you want.
[01:19:22.254 --> 01:19:25.036]  I mean, this is an incredible precedent of tyranny.
[01:19:26.217 --> 01:19:26.457]  Yes.
[01:19:27.618 --> 01:19:27.879]  Yes.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:29.280]  Yes.
[01:19:30.215 --> 01:19:38.980]  I find it excruciatingly painful to have people allow that to occur.
[01:19:40.941 --> 01:19:44.843]  If the government says that you can't drink the water, then somebody ought to say,
[01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:45.887]  Oh, no.
[01:19:46.087 --> 01:19:47.528]  Not on my watch.
[01:19:47.768 --> 01:19:48.909]  Let me jump in here.
[01:19:49.489 --> 01:19:58.914]  Not only are we talking about the 128,000 Gujarati farmers who have killed themselves because of GMO cotton, directly because of GMO cotton.
[01:19:59.014 --> 01:20:00.195]  And that's mainstream news.
[01:20:00.455 --> 01:20:02.036]  Pardon me?
[01:20:02.316 --> 01:20:03.396]  I mean, that's admitted, by the way.
[01:20:03.416 --> 01:20:04.417]  They're just killing themselves.
[01:20:04.477 --> 01:20:04.917]  Explain that.
[01:20:04.937 --> 01:20:05.778]  What's happening in India?
[01:20:07.459 --> 01:20:12.621]  What happens is that the GMO seed is given to the farmer.
[01:20:12.681 --> 01:20:13.902]  Now, remember, farmers
[01:20:14.512 --> 01:20:15.973]  And the operative word is give.
[01:20:41.516 --> 01:20:42.037]  Thank you so much.
[01:21:00.097 --> 01:21:18.611]  The GMO crops have in large measure been created in order to consume high levels of pesticide, and the pesticides are like glyphosate, the second most toxic chemical, non-ionizing radiation chemical known to cause cancer.
[01:21:18.711 --> 01:21:25.496]  And I saw mainline news, mainline news that these GMO cottons leach poison into you when you wear it.
[01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:39.431]  Exactly, and we've run a whole series on Morgellons, which is a nightmare brought to you from above through the chemtrail spraying and from your clothing through the GMO modifications.
[01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:42.931]  We're talking about an intolerably horrible disease.
[01:21:42.971 --> 01:21:43.231]  You know what?
[01:21:43.251 --> 01:21:45.091]  I'm going to skip this break so we have time here.
[01:21:45.111 --> 01:21:46.952]  We're going to break about 20 seconds on the internet.
[01:21:46.972 --> 01:21:47.472]  We'll still be live.
[01:21:47.492 --> 01:21:48.932]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[01:21:48.952 --> 01:21:53.733]  When we get back, I want to ask General Stubblebine about chemtrails, his expert opinion on that, as well as Dr. Labo.
[01:21:54.313 --> 01:22:00.215]  But let's continue talking about how they're forcing the GMO into countries right now with our guest.
[01:22:03.177 --> 01:22:07.860]  Okay, let's continue though and then let's come back with more gallons and back with chemtrails for the full audience.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:13.223]  We've got GMO cotton sales because it's not drought resistant.
[01:22:13.503 --> 01:22:29.673]  The farmers go bankrupt because they have to keep using more and more pesticides and the second year they don't have the money to pay back nor do they have the money for the new crop seeds because GMO seeds can't be saved as General Stubblebine was saying and as you've
[01:22:29.991 --> 01:22:30.111]  India!
[01:22:52.117 --> 01:22:52.717]  What that means.
[01:22:52.737 --> 01:23:00.539]  You're talking cities of 50 million, 20 million people, dead bodies laying around, human feces everywhere, hundreds of thousands of starving children.
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.100]  It's unbelievable.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:16.444]  Let me say, Alex, that I will live for the rest of my days with an image of a starving Ethiopian woman making the international sign for feed me, bringing her fingers to her lips, staring at me with
[01:23:17.202 --> 01:23:19.066]  Absolutely dead hopeless eyes.
[01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:21.913]  I will live with that graven in my consciousness.
[01:23:22.446 --> 01:23:23.687]  For the rest of my life.
[01:23:23.747 --> 01:23:25.008]  That is unnecessary.
[01:23:25.348 --> 01:23:36.697]  And it's being brought about by globalization for the purposes of the globalizers who are fundamentally... And I wanted to explain that, and I've seen the documents on this and studies, Monsanto and others will lose money.
[01:23:37.217 --> 01:23:40.760]  And they said, back in 99, the director, they said, we are trying to contaminate everything.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.841]  We are trying to take over.
[01:23:42.421 --> 01:23:45.003]  And then the world will soon be contaminated with our GMO.
[01:23:45.264 --> 01:23:46.124]  We have the patent.
[01:23:46.404 --> 01:23:47.425]  And then we rule Earth.
[01:23:47.806 --> 01:23:50.808]  And so they are, this is meant to just devastate.
[01:23:50.848 --> 01:23:51.648]  This is eugenics.
[01:23:51.689 --> 01:23:52.089]  Go ahead.
[01:23:53.769 --> 01:24:17.337]  So, the food supply is devastated, the cotton supply, the cotton won't grow, the farmers are pushed off their land, Monsanto gets the land, and now we have 128,000 heads of families dying primarily by drinking a half a cup of the very pesticide that has bankrupted them.
[01:24:17.853 --> 01:24:26.617]  We are talking about people, the face of humanity, being altered by this technology for its own purposes.
[01:24:26.917 --> 01:24:30.918]  It is not necessary to eat this food.
[01:24:30.998 --> 01:24:34.040]  It is not necessary to wear these products.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.422]  And for wicked, yuppies, self-centered people, you're not escaping it.
[01:24:39.462 --> 01:24:40.182]  Yeah, I hear them laugh.
[01:24:40.222 --> 01:24:40.922]  Yeah, get rid of them.
[01:24:40.962 --> 01:24:41.463]  They're black.
[01:24:41.483 --> 01:24:41.983]  They're Indian.
[01:24:43.343 --> 01:24:44.484]  You are not immune.
[01:24:44.564 --> 01:24:47.005]  This is all being done to you as a soft kill weapon.
[01:24:47.685 --> 01:24:49.165]  It's just being done slower.
[01:24:49.205 --> 01:24:52.066]  They haven't turned the ambient background up as high.
[01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:54.907]  But farms and ranches, most of them are being lost.
[01:24:54.947 --> 01:24:56.028]  I mean, most are gone.
[01:24:56.928 --> 01:24:58.588]  Our society is now being imploded.
[01:24:58.648 --> 01:25:08.591]  So now we, we, for being passive and not being involved and not fighting back like General Stubblebine was saying, we are now sowed the wind, we're going to reap the whirlwind.
[01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:15.654]  And as we come back, finish up, Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine, on what you're seeing in Central America with them forcing it in.
[01:25:16.114 --> 01:25:16.514]  Here we go.
[01:25:21.465 --> 01:25:23.628]  Back live, got 27 minutes left.
[01:25:23.648 --> 01:25:25.230]  I want to go to at least five of your calls.
[01:25:25.290 --> 01:25:27.893]  Sean, Toby, Robert, Sherry and Dan.
[01:25:28.294 --> 01:25:29.735]  From Washington to Illinois.
[01:25:30.096 --> 01:25:32.038]  Maybe get a few foreign callers in there as well.
[01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:39.191]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:39.992 --> 01:25:43.094]  Let's try to compartmentalize the info now, get it out as fast as possible.
[01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:48.799]  I want to go to calls here in just a few minutes with both of our guests.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.985]  Finishing up, how they force the GMO into countries, how it devastates the people.
[01:25:55.145 --> 01:26:03.452]  Even where it's illegal, they run what I would call, what the news calls, intelligence operations to go in and secretly plant this stuff in research facilities.
[01:26:04.767 --> 01:26:05.407]  Absolutely.
[01:26:06.268 --> 01:26:14.673]  I want to say that there's a famine predicted by very, very intelligent folks looking at what's happening to our food supply.
[01:26:14.693 --> 01:26:18.435]  I've posted an article on our Health Freedom blog called The Famine of 2009.
[01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:30.183]  If anybody in America thinks that we're not reaping that whirlwind, as you said, wait until their plates are empty and there are food riots, because that's where we're going, unless we start growing our own.
[01:26:30.928 --> 01:26:36.197]  And yes, Panama has been contaminated, Brazil, New Zealand was contaminated.
[01:26:36.681 --> 01:26:43.886]  Even though it was a GMO-free zone by national decree, or by national law, the U.S.
[01:26:43.966 --> 01:26:53.032]  shipped genetically modified corn and wheat to New Zealand for three years before they, quote, discovered the mistake, end quote.
[01:26:53.072 --> 01:26:59.996]  Today, New Zealand is growing pharmaceutical cows whose milk and meat delivers drugs.
[01:27:00.237 --> 01:27:01.617]  And they're now putting
[01:27:02.538 --> 01:27:14.423]  Cross-species pigs, mixing them, I just saw this in the BBC a few weeks ago, that have had human genetics added to them so the body parts that can be used, the valves and things, won't be rejected.
[01:27:15.183 --> 01:27:23.206]  They're now saying it's safe for us to eat cloned food, milk from cloned cows, and to eat cows that are part human.
[01:27:23.726 --> 01:27:26.247]  Speak to that, I mean the nightmare just goes on and on.
[01:27:26.267 --> 01:27:28.548]  And then General Stubblebine chemtrails.
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:45.890]  Well, the chemtrails are another phenomenon that's being used to, you know, essentially poison all of the folks that are going to be subjected to wherever the chemtrails finally, or the pieces of the chemtrails finally land.
[01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:49.452]  These things, you can see them.
[01:27:50.033 --> 01:27:57.858]  Normally, if you look up in the sky and you see an airplane and a little fume or a plum comes out of the rear,
[01:27:59.386 --> 01:28:03.847]  That normally is a contrail, and it disappears.
[01:28:03.867 --> 01:28:11.209]  So you hold up your fingers about two inches, and that should disappear.
[01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:14.110]  These are not contrails.
[01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:18.531]  They are chemtrails, and they do not disappear.
[01:28:18.551 --> 01:28:27.574]  The plane will fly all the way across from horizon to horizon, putting out these chemical toxins
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:32.803]  Uh, that, uh, essentially then fall to the ground, fall to the earth.
[01:28:33.504 --> 01:28:34.304]  And what do you do?
[01:28:34.404 --> 01:28:36.466]  You breathe them.
[01:28:36.526 --> 01:28:38.607]  You breathe this stuff.
[01:28:38.747 --> 01:28:41.750]  Furthermore, what they do is they crisscross.
[01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:48.274]  So it looks like a, a, a tic-tac-toe up in the sky or a set of tic-tac-toes up in the sky.
[01:28:48.995 --> 01:28:56.660]  And, uh, obviously what they're trying to do is to inundate an entire country or inundate an entire area.
[01:28:57.321 --> 01:28:58.904]  Well I was going to...
[01:29:08.735 --> 01:29:10.317]  Deformed genetic material.
[01:29:10.457 --> 01:29:12.038]  Partial red blood cell virus.
[01:29:12.118 --> 01:29:12.699]  Aluminum.
[01:29:12.779 --> 01:29:13.840]  Barium.
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.620]  Beryllium.
[01:29:14.801 --> 01:29:17.323]  Aluminum does not belong in your body.
[01:29:17.663 --> 01:29:21.287]  Well, let me add just something briefly here, because it's so important.
[01:29:21.947 --> 01:29:34.038]  I'm sure you guys know about this, but in case you don't, I've now learned in the last year, they call it, you know, these aerosol spraying programs, and hundreds of universities, Department of Energy and others, they admit, but they don't call it chemtrails,
[01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:40.547]  That it is secret programs for testing the weather and doing other things and to test global warming.
[01:29:40.967 --> 01:30:03.303]  They admit that they are doing it now and the reason they had to do it was so many government people who were compartmentalized were asking and confirming and testing that they had to come out and admit and now it's in high school textbooks that oh yes they're spraying that as a sunscreen for the earth and claiming it's weather modification but I mean I'm just throwing that out.
[01:30:03.323 --> 01:30:03.964]  Your take on that?
[01:30:05.282 --> 01:30:05.962]  Absolutely.
[01:30:06.883 --> 01:30:07.883]  That's what they tell you.
[01:30:08.183 --> 01:30:13.586]  One of the reasons that we're in Panama is that there are no chemtrails.
[01:30:13.646 --> 01:30:20.248]  Now, General Stubblebine and I have seen a chemtrail here in the highlands of Panama, but it was over Costa Rica.
[01:30:20.609 --> 01:30:22.910]  There are no chemtrails in Panama.
[01:30:23.370 --> 01:30:33.114]  And we believe that that's because of a very intentional decision that the elite have decided that there are going to be enclaves
[01:30:33.672 --> 01:30:39.976]  Where they foolishly think that they can separate the damage they're doing from the earth from where they live.
[01:30:40.016 --> 01:30:42.557]  Yeah, why has Bush bought all this land in Paraguay?
[01:30:42.797 --> 01:30:44.538]  Why is Dick Cheney moving to Dubai?
[01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:47.280]  Is he moving to Dubai?
[01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:47.800]  I missed that one.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:49.681]  Yeah, he bought a big house there and dumped his dollars.
[01:30:50.622 --> 01:30:52.783]  Probably because there's no extradition.
[01:30:54.083 --> 01:31:01.848]  But, in Paraguay, the piece of land that the Bush family bought, then a Bush bought for the family, is
[01:31:03.010 --> 01:31:06.894]  Situated directly over the world's largest freshwater aquifer.
[01:31:07.194 --> 01:31:12.459]  And water is going to be another issue, because there's not going to be enough water to go around.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.462]  Good God, I want to go to some phone calls here.
[01:31:18.263 --> 01:31:22.067]  Well, I didn't notice it when I was on active duty because I was too busy believing, doing,
[01:31:44.452 --> 01:31:53.619]  I really believed in what I was doing, so I wasn't paying any attention to the picture that I now see.
[01:31:54.260 --> 01:32:00.665]  However, about two years ago, suddenly, all of the dots, just like you and I were talking earlier,
[01:32:09.614 --> 01:32:10.775]  Just appear to be dogs.
[01:32:10.875 --> 01:32:20.219]  Suddenly there's a picture that just sort of jumps out of the screen and you hit you in the face and you say, Oh my God, Oh my God, what the hell is this?
[01:32:20.839 --> 01:32:22.720]  And then you say, no, it can't be true.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.441]  And you try to make it go back into the screen and it won't.
[01:32:26.942 --> 01:32:28.282]  And so it pops out again.
[01:32:28.702 --> 01:32:31.524]  You say, all right, it's real.
[01:32:32.264 --> 01:32:34.685]  Now, what do I do about it?
[01:32:35.465 --> 01:32:38.987]  And so this occurred after I retired.
[01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:53.131]  This sudden realization that all of the things that I believed in, all of the things that I fought for in my country, were a bunch of baloney.
[01:32:53.331 --> 01:32:59.612]  I'd been sold a bill of goods and been duped.
[01:32:59.812 --> 01:33:08.694]  Incidentally, it's very, very difficult to admit that you did not see it at the time, that you were duped, that you'd been taken for a ride.
[01:33:09.535 --> 01:33:15.238]  And that all of this was going on even way back when.
[01:33:15.898 --> 01:33:17.819]  Well, it's all compartmentalized.
[01:33:17.839 --> 01:33:17.819]  1984.
[01:33:18.019 --> 01:33:19.400]  Well, it's all compartmentalized.
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:23.322]  I mean, it's all compartmentalized, sir, as you know, so you're certainly not guilty.
[01:33:23.602 --> 01:33:26.544]  You would be guilty if you then figured it out and then didn't do something.
[01:33:26.804 --> 01:33:29.405]  Let's jam in some final calls here for our amazing guest.
[01:33:29.785 --> 01:33:35.068]  Sean, in Washington, you're on the air with Major General Stubblebine and Dr. Lebo.
[01:33:35.088 --> 01:33:35.408]  Go ahead.
[01:33:35.428 --> 01:33:38.790]  Is this General Albert Stubblebine III?
[01:33:40.336 --> 01:33:40.736]  Yes, it is.
[01:33:40.796 --> 01:33:41.376]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:33:41.396 --> 01:33:42.337]  You got a question or comment?
[01:33:43.237 --> 01:33:44.617]  Yeah, I want to ask him a question.
[01:33:45.298 --> 01:33:46.878]  Were you the head of U.S.
[01:33:46.958 --> 01:33:51.260]  Army Intelligence Instrum at Fort Meade in 1981-84 with General Acuno?
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.140]  Were you his CO?
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:56.242]  Were you also a director or head of Psychotechnology?
[01:33:56.262 --> 01:33:56.682]  Hold on, sir.
[01:33:56.722 --> 01:33:57.802]  Your phone's echoing.
[01:33:57.822 --> 01:33:59.803]  Just talk slow so we can understand you.
[01:34:00.103 --> 01:34:01.823]  I can't understand a word he says.
[01:34:02.544 --> 01:34:05.005]  I heard something about, were you the director of intelligence?
[01:34:05.225 --> 01:34:06.885]  And then, I mean, you have to talk clearly, sir.
[01:34:07.826 --> 01:34:09.026]  Okay, I'll say again.
[01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.410]  Were you the director of U.S.
[01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:17.432]  Army Intelligence in SCOMP between 1981 and 1984 at Fort Meade, Maryland?
[01:34:18.872 --> 01:34:19.172]  Yes.
[01:34:20.592 --> 01:34:30.334]  Were you also a director or head of Psychotronics, Inc., which produced non-lethal psychotronic or developed weapons for the army?
[01:34:32.495 --> 01:34:33.475]  Psychotronics?
[01:34:33.575 --> 01:34:33.915]  No.
[01:34:35.215 --> 01:34:38.676]  Did you also run the GOAT lab at Fort Bragg, North Carolina?
[01:34:39.482 --> 01:34:40.683]  Well, he talked about that earlier.
[01:34:40.763 --> 01:34:42.765]  No, he said he passed that information on.
[01:34:42.785 --> 01:34:42.825]  No.
[01:34:42.845 --> 01:34:45.627]  The answer to that is no.
[01:34:46.528 --> 01:34:59.418]  I guess I just find this gentleman highly uncredible, given that you ran an army intelligence unit in the 80s, working with Michael Aquino, who started OTO, the Temple of Sacks.
[01:35:00.178 --> 01:35:02.360]  It is run by satanic cults.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.782]  Okay, well, let's talk about Aquino, and then I'm going to let you go.
[01:35:05.463 --> 01:35:06.984]  Did you work with that Aquino character?
[01:35:08.854 --> 01:35:09.394]  The keynote?
[01:35:09.454 --> 01:35:10.195]  I don't remember.
[01:35:10.415 --> 01:35:13.497]  That doesn't ring a bell.
[01:35:14.577 --> 01:35:19.820]  I mean, General Stubblebine was the commander of special forces and the commander of intelligence.
[01:35:21.221 --> 01:35:25.163]  I was the commander of the Army Intelligence and Security Committee.
[01:35:25.443 --> 01:35:30.786]  I was responsible for all of the army intelligence and intelligence forces around the world.
[01:35:33.979 --> 01:35:36.660]  Yeah, and I had units all over the world.
[01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.021]  Very twisted.
[01:35:54.409 --> 01:35:57.771]  I mean, it's dark satire, and people that don't know that don't understand it.
[01:35:58.132 --> 01:36:04.736]  Because I was like in Northern California in these big trees going, man, this is like something out of a 1930s werewolf movie.
[01:36:04.756 --> 01:36:08.859]  Because, you know, there was fog like four feet deep, and it looked like those old movies.
[01:36:08.899 --> 01:36:12.022]  And I thought that was always, you know, something that didn't exist.
[01:36:12.062 --> 01:36:15.364]  And I was like, wow, you know, the fog's really, really thick here.
[01:36:15.384 --> 01:36:17.706]  I've never seen fog this thick, like in a movie.
[01:36:18.306 --> 01:36:24.517]  And in the book he has me scared in my hotel room of vampires and goblins.
[01:36:24.557 --> 01:36:25.960]  So, it's not true.
[01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:30.387]  General Stubblebine told you, without you even calling, that
[01:36:31.570 --> 01:36:35.733]  That this was passed across his desk and sent to Fort Bragg because I asked him about it.
[01:36:35.773 --> 01:36:37.474]  And yes, they were looking into all that stuff.
[01:36:37.574 --> 01:36:40.016]  And so, I don't think he was listening earlier.
[01:36:40.036 --> 01:36:43.478]  And the other issue is the fruits are what are important.
[01:36:43.518 --> 01:36:46.280]  They're warning people about GMO crops.
[01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:48.322]  They're warning people about real things.
[01:36:48.362 --> 01:36:51.104]  It's a red herring, but we let you ask your questions.
[01:36:51.164 --> 01:36:52.525]  Toby, in Indiana.
[01:36:52.585 --> 01:36:53.506]  Toby, you're on the air.
[01:36:53.546 --> 01:36:53.906]  Go ahead.
[01:36:55.663 --> 01:36:56.643]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:36:58.304 --> 01:37:01.165]  You kind of touched on, I was going to ask about the chemtrails.
[01:37:01.465 --> 01:37:08.728]  I live here in Indiana, Indianapolis, and a day doesn't go by that I don't see dozens and dozens of chemtrails crisscrossing.
[01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:15.690]  Do you know if those are military airplanes or commercial airplanes?
[01:37:16.815 --> 01:37:17.996]  Some of all of the above.
[01:37:18.436 --> 01:37:18.976]  All the above?
[01:37:19.036 --> 01:37:20.697]  Yeah, they add a lot of it to the fuel.
[01:37:20.837 --> 01:37:22.258]  Again, it's compartmentalized.
[01:37:22.758 --> 01:37:25.480]  You've got three major wholesalers of it, so it's added there.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.901]  But it's not in all aircraft.
[01:37:28.142 --> 01:37:36.907]  So, I mean, I was thinking about, you know, trying to grow some of my own food, but with that stuff being sprayed in the sky, it probably makes more sense to try to grow stuff indoors?
[01:37:38.307 --> 01:37:40.309]  Do you put it in a greenhouse?
[01:37:40.329 --> 01:37:44.971]  Do intensive farming indoors to create a community
[01:37:46.483 --> 01:37:51.628]  Greenhouse for your neighbors if you're not too far out in the country to have neighbors.
[01:37:52.328 --> 01:37:58.874]  Do not, do not assume that just because the sun is shining your food is safe.
[01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:05.761]  And if you live in a farming area, your food is contaminated with genetically modified material.
[01:38:08.028 --> 01:38:09.269]  Whether you know it or not.
[01:38:09.309 --> 01:38:10.430]  Yeah, it blows around.
[01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:12.551]  I mean, let's explain.
[01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:24.520]  Even the organic crops are having, you know, the same species but a different variety blow in and then plants aren't like a person where you've got one dad, one mom.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:26.961]  Doctor, you want to explain that briefly?
[01:38:27.221 --> 01:38:29.803]  That plants take on the genetics of even other species?
[01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:34.086]  I was about to talk about this when we got to the call.
[01:38:35.729 --> 01:38:42.794]  Even organic food is allowed in the United States to have 10% genetically modified contamination.
[01:38:43.195 --> 01:38:48.018]  In the rest of the world, it's either 0.9% or 1%, depending on the country.
[01:38:48.379 --> 01:38:56.965]  So we're talking about one-tenth of the material that you eat when you're eating organic food being contaminated and still called organic.
[01:38:58.458 --> 01:39:02.140]  It is absolutely essential that you start growing your own food.
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:10.804]  Plants get contaminated not only by the same species as we used to think, but also by other species.
[01:39:10.844 --> 01:39:12.505]  The genetic material mixes.
[01:39:12.845 --> 01:39:17.287]  The results are absolutely not in your favor.
[01:39:17.387 --> 01:39:18.368]  Alright, Toby, gotta jump.
[01:39:18.428 --> 01:39:19.528]  Robert in Canada, go ahead.
[01:39:19.548 --> 01:39:20.749]  I'm trying to go quick with these calls here.
[01:39:21.129 --> 01:39:21.749]  Robert, go ahead.
[01:39:21.769 --> 01:39:22.610]  You're on the air with our guest.
[01:39:24.084 --> 01:39:25.265]  Yeah, I'm in Toronto.
[01:39:25.805 --> 01:39:27.947]  This is a Northern Molecular comment.
[01:39:29.027 --> 01:39:45.437]  Back in the 80s, and the doctor will understand this, I had an immune system collapse and I was going to die, according to my doctor of internal medicine, of some sort of lymphoma.
[01:39:45.977 --> 01:39:49.559]  The Epstein-Barr and other viruses had activated and it was going chronic.
[01:39:49.599 --> 01:39:52.241]  I contacted the Palo Alto Institute in California.
[01:39:53.208 --> 01:40:00.494]  I talked with Pauling's people, Linus Pauling, who, by the way, had 480 honorary PhDs and two Nobel Prizes.
[01:40:00.634 --> 01:40:11.662]  Correspondingly, they put me on to Cathcart, Dr. Cathcart in Philadelphia, and they said, if you take vitamin C at the appropriate doses three times a day, what will happen is you'll kill the virus.
[01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:17.487]  Their claim was any virus, any acute virus, will be killed by vitamin C if it's used properly.
[01:40:18.548 --> 01:40:19.509]  Now, that's what happened.
[01:40:20.569 --> 01:40:22.471]  And this is the issue now with the Codex.
[01:40:23.246 --> 01:40:36.293]  I've been taking 25 grams of C for 20, 22, 23 years, and if they cut off the supply of C, I've been told by physicians I'm in deep trouble.
[01:40:36.813 --> 01:40:38.994]  I contacted my... I have pieces for you.
[01:40:39.054 --> 01:40:47.258]  I've practiced orthomolecular medicine for many, many years, and what you say is right, although most people can't handle, the GI tract can't handle.
[01:40:47.702 --> 01:40:48.242]  That's right.
[01:41:16.392 --> 01:41:37.289]  All pathogens against which it's been tested currently 635 of them including the H5N1 virus which we believe to have been modified and the HIV supposed causal virus.
[01:41:37.549 --> 01:41:40.952]  We're talking about an immensely important completely safe
[01:41:41.483 --> 01:41:44.946]  And totally universally applicable.
[01:41:44.986 --> 01:41:47.808]  And that's why they're trying to restrict that, right here in Texas.
[01:41:47.848 --> 01:41:50.470]  You see, essentially my comment... Hello?
[01:41:50.490 --> 01:41:52.212]  Yeah, they're trying to kill you, sir.
[01:41:52.232 --> 01:41:57.276]  Yeah, essentially my comment is about the suppression of orthomolecular solutions.
[01:41:57.876 --> 01:41:59.638]  In my case, it worked.
[01:41:59.898 --> 01:42:07.644]  The doctor who in fact supported me in this particular endeavor was quite severely chastised.
[01:42:09.219 --> 01:42:14.044]  And she, there was some quite interesting political things that were happening 20 odd years ago.
[01:42:14.584 --> 01:42:16.166]  So I wanted just to put that in.
[01:42:16.386 --> 01:42:25.455]  I wanted to sort of show that, because there's so much talk about, you know, the suppression of medical solutions, orthomolecular and alternative medical solutions.
[01:42:25.615 --> 01:42:26.716]  This is just one case.
[01:42:27.236 --> 01:42:28.437]  And I thought I'd tell you about it.
[01:42:28.738 --> 01:42:30.519]  But thanks for the information.
[01:42:30.559 --> 01:42:31.040]  Thank you.
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:31.881]  Appreciate it.
[01:42:32.694 --> 01:42:43.263]  Natural medicine, but there's also a war against the people who are bringing you natural medicine, against physicians and non-physicians who are sharing this information and using these techniques.
[01:42:43.383 --> 01:42:45.245]  An absolute war against them.
[01:42:45.605 --> 01:42:47.987]  And the reason is because they work.
[01:42:48.708 --> 01:43:00.878]  They work just like they work for you, they work for me, they work for Dr. Arema, they work for people who use them, and they, the people who are in this genocidal approach,
[01:43:01.237 --> 01:43:05.599]  We do not want something like that that works.
[01:43:06.239 --> 01:43:08.360]  They would much rather give you GMO.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:10.221]  They'd much rather give you drugs.
[01:43:10.341 --> 01:43:11.521]  Stay there, stay there, stay there.
[01:43:11.541 --> 01:43:11.882]  Got a break.
[01:43:11.902 --> 01:43:12.202]  Here we go.
[01:43:12.262 --> 01:43:12.802]  Final segment.
[01:43:13.382 --> 01:43:13.742]  Attention.
[01:43:13.762 --> 01:43:14.363]  Skip this break, too.
[01:43:15.796 --> 01:43:16.837]  We're on internet only.
[01:43:16.937 --> 01:43:19.079]  I appreciate your call, Robert.
[01:43:19.099 --> 01:43:25.645]  I'm going to talk to Sherry and Dan just for internet only, but that's tens of thousands live right now and hundreds of thousands within a day and millions within weeks.
[01:43:25.986 --> 01:43:27.647]  That's the exponential power of the web.
[01:43:27.667 --> 01:43:28.868]  That's why they're now moving.
[01:43:29.469 --> 01:43:31.871]  I've got to do a whole show on this to attack the web.
[01:43:31.891 --> 01:43:32.972]  They're openly announcing it.
[01:43:32.992 --> 01:43:34.574]  They're shutting it down all over the place.
[01:43:35.214 --> 01:43:37.795]  Definitely things are moving quicker than I'd even thought.
[01:43:37.815 --> 01:43:40.096]  And I don't like that because I want more time to beat these people.
[01:43:40.436 --> 01:43:44.458]  But let's take a few final calls and we'll come back live on air and say bye to our guest.
[01:43:44.498 --> 01:43:49.920]  And let's not wait a year before we have General Stubblebine and Dr. Labo back on the show.
[01:43:50.641 --> 01:43:53.782]  Let's go ahead and go to Sherry in Texas.
[01:43:54.242 --> 01:43:55.243]  You're on the air.
[01:43:55.283 --> 01:43:55.663]  Go ahead.
[01:43:55.683 --> 01:43:55.723]  Hi.
[01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:57.504]  Hi Alex.
[01:43:58.775 --> 01:44:05.196]  I just had a question about chemtrails and their effect on humans.
[01:44:06.157 --> 01:44:12.478]  I have a family member who has stage 3 breast cancer and she believes in chemtrails, finally.
[01:44:12.498 --> 01:44:16.019]  I finally got pictures of them, video of them, showed them to her.
[01:44:16.039 --> 01:44:19.059]  These are not contrails, Mom.
[01:44:19.079 --> 01:44:24.901]  She basically doesn't think that they're affecting anything.
[01:44:30.427 --> 01:44:31.387]  Well, let me just be clear.
[01:44:31.687 --> 01:44:34.029]  The chemtrail phenomenon, it's a cocktail.
[01:44:34.269 --> 01:44:38.731]  There's a bunch of different operations going on, and it's highly classified.
[01:44:39.011 --> 01:44:44.894]  They're only admitting the weather modification portion of them, and so we don't know.
[01:44:44.954 --> 01:44:45.975]  We need more research.
[01:44:45.995 --> 01:44:46.595]  But I know this.
[01:44:47.055 --> 01:44:47.295]  Until 1996,
[01:44:48.476 --> 01:44:49.637]  Trails were up there.
[01:44:49.957 --> 01:44:51.818]  They formed at 30,000 feet or higher.
[01:44:51.858 --> 01:44:53.399]  They were there for 30 seconds a minute.
[01:44:53.679 --> 01:44:56.321]  Now they're there for two hours while I'm in the garden.
[01:44:56.901 --> 01:44:58.823]  And then they start floating down.
[01:44:59.803 --> 01:45:01.624]  But go ahead, Doctor.
[01:45:01.644 --> 01:45:09.970]  Well, what I was going to say is if you Google Morgellons, M-O-R-G-E-L-L-O-N-S-G-E-L-L-O-N-S
[01:45:17.392 --> 01:45:17.992]  We're good to go.
[01:45:41.323 --> 01:45:42.284]  Well, listen, we're out of time.
[01:45:42.304 --> 01:45:43.044]  Thank you so much, Sherry.
[01:45:43.084 --> 01:45:45.345]  I'm going to try to cram Dan in for the full audience.
[01:46:07.045 --> 01:46:11.936]  The government is taking foster children and testing pesticides on them until they die.
[01:46:11.956 --> 01:46:12.939]  New York Daily News.
[01:46:13.319 --> 01:46:13.881]  Believe!
[01:46:13.941 --> 01:46:15.504]  The people running things are evil.
[01:46:15.524 --> 01:46:15.885]  Here we go.
[01:46:26.001 --> 01:46:30.763]  All right, real fast, because I've got to let my guests go, and I appreciate them joining us today.
[01:46:30.783 --> 01:46:32.004]  I hope to have them back very soon.
[01:46:32.104 --> 01:46:37.867]  Dan in Illinois, final caller for General Stubblebine, Major General Stubblebine, and Dr. Labo.
[01:46:37.887 --> 01:46:38.227]  Go ahead.
[01:46:38.247 --> 01:46:40.308]  Hey, Alex, I respect your show.
[01:46:40.348 --> 01:46:41.329]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:46:42.069 --> 01:46:49.293]  Really quickly, I want to say my stepfather, I live here in Illinois, and he works in the agriculture business, and he does a lot of work with chemicals and fields.
[01:46:50.614 --> 01:46:51.154]  That's how he's
[01:46:52.031 --> 01:46:52.492]  I don't know.
[01:47:14.901 --> 01:47:23.247]  And maybe what's the best way that I could go about... I would give him studies about how it's sterilizing rats and say that, you know, that the studies show the same thing to humans.
[01:47:23.307 --> 01:47:26.230]  I mean, do you want to be involved in something that's hurting people?
[01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:31.193]  Because he's compartmentalized, and I would send him to InfoWars.com.
[01:47:31.333 --> 01:47:36.237]  I would send him to the website of our guest today.
[01:47:36.257 --> 01:47:39.259]  I mean, there's a lot of things that you can do like that.
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:41.641]  Can I add something real quick?
[01:47:41.661 --> 01:47:42.102]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:47:43.220 --> 01:48:03.582]  I would suggest you tell him that you were listening to the show and you heard General Stubblebine, a man with a career of great luster, who realized that the forces that he was serving throughout his career were not what he understood them to be, and he had the courage to say,
[01:48:04.694 --> 01:48:13.785]  I did what I did with a heart of purity, but the people I was working for lied to me, and now I need to spread the information about what's real.
[01:48:15.692 --> 01:48:17.213]  Your dad can do the same.
[01:48:17.233 --> 01:48:30.897]  Absolutely, and I'm sorry to say to Dan and Dr. Labo and General Stubblebine that we are just flat out of time, but I want to thank you both for spending time with us today, and I want everybody to visit the website healthfreedomusa.org, and we'll also put it up on the screen.
[01:48:32.097 --> 01:48:39.639]  Absolutely, General Stubblebine was compartmentalized, I was compartmentalized, we all are in life, and the claims we're making are very serious.
[01:48:39.659 --> 01:48:40.779]  You better check them out, folks.
[01:48:41.079 --> 01:48:43.460]  General Stubblebine, Dr. Labo, thank you for joining us.

[01:49:13.358 --> 01:49:22.764]  Some of the sponsors that tie into all of this are eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com, the best storable foods company out there at the best price that I have personally found.

[01:50:00.496 --> 01:50:04.098]  I mean, why wouldn't they be amazed that, you know, masses of people are calling and getting it?
[01:50:04.618 --> 01:50:06.579]  It's an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[01:50:06.619 --> 01:50:09.181]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[01:50:09.561 --> 01:50:12.142]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it.

[01:50:14.103 --> 01:50:14.864]  Neutral pH.
[01:50:14.884 --> 01:50:16.524]  Then goes through five filters inside.

[01:50:28.856 --> 01:50:33.781]  Grabs the water out of the air, then puts it through five filters, and it is just perfect.
[01:50:34.489 --> 01:50:35.670]  Awesome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:35.690 --> 01:50:38.771]  These things are awesome.
