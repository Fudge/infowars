[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.370]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.190]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:03.851 --> 00:00:04.671]  You want answers?
[00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:06.332]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:10.593]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:15.275]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:40.516]  Could there have been more than one shooter involved in the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy?
[00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:46.339]  RFK was shot in Los Angeles shortly after claiming victory in California's Democratic primary.
[00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:57.925]  The shooter, Sirhan Sirhan, is serving a life sentence for the assassination, but at a forensics conference this weekend in Connecticut, new theories he might not have fired the fatal shots.
[00:00:58.165 --> 00:00:58.846]  Is that possible?
[00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:03.107]  Amy Parmenter from NBC station WVIT in Hartford was there.
[00:01:03.687 --> 00:01:06.048]  Amy, what led experts to this theory?
[00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:13.310]  Well, actually it was a very interesting theory that was presented yesterday at this symposium, presented by a couple of scientists.
[00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.771]  So, of course, it was rather complicated and detailed.
[00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:18.332]  I'm going to try to simplify it for you a little bit.
[00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:21.373]  The scientists, two independent researchers,
[00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:30.240]  Dr. Robert Jolling and Philipp von Praag, forensic evidence experts, actually have been studying the Kennedy assassination separately.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.227]  They never even met until last year when they met at a seminar and realized that their independent conclusions were almost perfectly matched.
[00:01:38.587 --> 00:01:46.609]  Now, Joling, what he was able to come up with by studying the forensics evidence was that Sirhan Sirhan could not have fired the fatal shot.
[00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:52.891]  And that's because, according to his findings, that fatal shot came from behind Senator Kennedy.
[00:01:52.931 --> 00:02:01.914]  And of course, witnesses all put Sirhan Sirhan face to face with Kennedy, about four to six feet away, so he would not have had the opportunity to shoot from behind.
[00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.715]  Now, Von Praag, what he studied was a little more complicated.
[00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:26.846]  He actually looked at the audio recording known as the Pruszynski recording, which was made by a Canadian journalist, actually inadvertently, who had left his tape recording on after recording Kennedy's victory speech, and then as he kind of followed the Kennedy entourage into the kitchen pantry there at the Ambassador Hotel, the tape was still rolling, rather.
[00:02:27.586 --> 00:02:29.007]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:30.868]  It is already Friday, the 28th day of March 2008.
[00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:44.027]  And we're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we have a jam-packed broadcast with three different big guests for you today.
[00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:49.271]  One of them is a surprise guest in the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:57.557]  We will obviously be talking more about RFK and how he was killed by the CIA today.
[00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.362]  Separately, NBC News, ABC News, and BBC
[00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.541]  ...have come out with separate evidence showing and proving the government killed RFK.
[00:03:12.622 --> 00:03:17.163]  And incidentally, on Sunday, on the Sunday edition show coming up in two days, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:03:17.603 --> 00:03:24.846]  Central, I've got one of the highest level members of the Japanese Parliament, the Diet.
[00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:28.708]  He's the head of the second largest party in Japan.
[00:03:29.768 --> 00:03:31.429]  He's going to be joining us from Japan.
[00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:35.130]  I'll give you a heads up on that on the radio show Sunday.
[00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:37.046]  And so will Jim Mars.
[00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:49.131]  Jim is going to be joining us Sunday to talk about not just the murders of JFK, which has now been, for all intents and purposes, admitted.
[00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:54.474]  The guy running the operation, Deathbed Confession, the evidence just piles to the sun.
[00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:58.296]  But now the murder of RFK.
[00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:02.698]  Now, the official Los Angeles County coroner
[00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:09.323]  Said he'd been shot multiple times in the back, and that he'd been shot at close range, and there were even powder burns on his jacket.
[00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:13.286]  Sirhan Sirhan, with a different caliber, shot into the ceiling.
[00:04:16.708 --> 00:04:17.889]  As he was programmed to do.
[00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:19.990]  With a completely different caliber.
[00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.191]  I mean, it was a no-brainer.
[00:04:21.992 --> 00:04:24.814]  One caliber was shot into RFK's back at point-blank range.
[00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:29.397]  The other was a handgun shot into the ceiling.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.848]  And that's always been the fact, and we always knew that, so now, BBC and NBC and, oh, they're breaking the major news.
[00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.051]  He got that nomination and they killed him.
[00:04:46.213 --> 00:04:47.153]  That's how they roll.
[00:04:47.173 --> 00:04:49.876]  And then they told the cattle that they didn't.
[00:04:54.855 --> 00:05:02.779]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.461]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:09.862]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.351]  A New World Order.
[00:05:59.051 --> 00:06:03.334]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world government.
[00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:06.756]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:06.796 --> 00:06:09.037]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:12.019]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:20.083]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:28.083]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:28.543 --> 00:06:32.024]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:32.424 --> 00:06:34.905]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:36.126]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:36.906]  They're not after money.
[00:06:36.926 --> 00:06:38.006]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:38.207 --> 00:06:38.927]  They're after power.
[00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:40.007]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:53.014]  You have been warned.
[00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:57.001]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:06:57.162 --> 00:07:02.386]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:08.030]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:09.531]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:09.892 --> 00:07:18.899]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:20.821]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:07:59.947 --> 00:08:02.228]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:29.994]  It is Friday, my friends.
[00:08:32.035 --> 00:08:34.037]  Massive broadcast lined up for you.
[00:08:34.538 --> 00:08:37.340]  A journalist who ferreted even more information out.
[00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:42.061]  of last month's announcement that the Canadian and U.S.
[00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:45.664]  military are, for all intents and purposes, being merged.
[00:08:46.504 --> 00:08:49.346]  We'll be joining us for 30 minutes at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:56.011]  We have a surprise guest joining us the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:08:56.631 --> 00:09:05.818]  And in the first 30 minutes of the third hour, we have some expert guests joining us to go over the illegal government DNA database.
[00:09:06.585 --> 00:09:16.989]  Every child born in this country is put in an illegal federal database and now that information is digitized and put into the Department of Homeland Security criminal database.
[00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:18.750]  Newborn babies are criminals.
[00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:22.851]  Everyone is a criminal inside this system.
[00:09:22.891 --> 00:09:24.212]  We are all criminals.
[00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:27.793]  Only the almighty state owned by the private bankers.
[00:09:28.854 --> 00:09:29.634]  It is God.
[00:09:31.715 --> 00:09:32.115]  All right.
[00:09:33.689 --> 00:09:36.931]  Let me go over some of the news we'll be covering in the meantime.
[00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:38.992]  CIA claim.
[00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:44.536]  CIA role claim in Kennedy killing.
[00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:53.441]  New video and photographic evidence that puts three senior CIA operatives at the scene of Robert Kennedy's assassination has been brought to light.
[00:09:53.561 --> 00:10:01.366]  So, this came out three or four days ago
[00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:17.134]  In the BBC and then a few days later in the US, they decide to focus on a scientific symposium where they have top forensic experts going over the fact that he was clearly shot in the back.
[00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:29.538]  But the evidence of top CIA officials being at the event, which we've always known, that's the bigger evidence.
[00:10:32.085 --> 00:10:40.048]  And then you have the forensics, the LA coroner, on record said he was shot in the back by a different caliber than what Sirhan Sirhan was shooting from the front.
[00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:55.034]  RFK, Robert Kennedy, was not shot in the front.
[00:10:56.895 --> 00:10:57.875]  He was shot in the back.
[00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:26.782]  And We Are Change questioned his son just a few weeks ago about E. Howard Hunt, the admitted Watergate chief, the admitted CIA section chief, the admitted individual that had overthrown scores of nations, on his deathbed said that he ran the operation to kill JFK.
[00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:37.528]  And in that same Rolling Stones article, he talked about how he wished and couldn't wait till Bobby was killed and then was real happy when he was killed.
[00:11:38.668 --> 00:11:39.289]  And what'd he say?
[00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:42.269]  He just, oh, that's a, you know, I don't want to talk about that.
[00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:49.251]  I don't want to, you know, I don't want to, I don't really care to hear from what E. Howard Hunt has to say.
[00:11:52.472 --> 00:11:53.512]  Completely gelded.
[00:11:55.262 --> 00:12:00.624]  Completely castrated, mumbling about how we need global taxes to save us from global warming.
[00:12:00.664 --> 00:12:01.485]  Just effeminate.
[00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:04.926]  It's not even right to call those type of men effeminate.
[00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:10.088]  They are... Because women are tough.
[00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.489]  Women are, in many cases, more outspoken than men.
[00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:14.270]  So it's wrong to call them effeminate.
[00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.831]  But they don't show male characteristics.
[00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:23.794]  So I guess... I mean, you kill my daddy, I'm gonna be talking about it.
[00:12:27.173 --> 00:12:31.057]  But I guess from the time he was a little boy, they said, you keep your mouth shut, they'll come get you.
[00:12:31.077 --> 00:12:35.641]  And I bet he cried in bed and was scared of shadows outside his window.
[00:12:38.664 --> 00:12:49.395]  And so he'll... And we've got letters from JFK's secretary talking about how she knows they killed him, the whole family knows it.
[00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:51.697]  They just keep their mouths shut.
[00:12:54.972 --> 00:12:57.933]  Now the word is that JFK Jr.
[00:12:59.073 --> 00:13:06.394]  was preparing, in fact he done even some exposés in his own magazine, was preparing to really go public and also run against Hillary.
[00:13:06.994 --> 00:13:10.615]  So they clearly whacked him, the evidence of that is manifest.
[00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:11.835]  He should have spoken out earlier!
[00:13:13.315 --> 00:13:19.736]  Less time jogging, less time acting cool, less time socializing, more time speaking out.
[00:13:19.956 --> 00:13:21.276]  You be alive, my friend.
[00:13:22.817 --> 00:13:24.217]  I'm not bashing you, I'm just
[00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:30.674]  Trying to encourage others, before they do sleep with the fishes, to speak out.
[00:13:31.374 --> 00:13:32.355]  That's what keeps you safe.
[00:13:33.476 --> 00:13:35.918]  Just like they say in JFK to Jim Garrison.
[00:13:36.318 --> 00:13:38.840]  By the way, that's based on true conversations he had.
[00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:47.767]  According to the screenwriter, Jim Mars and others that I've talked to,
[00:13:50.342 --> 00:13:50.983]  C.I.A.
[00:13:51.103 --> 00:13:52.984]  role claim in Kennedy killing.
[00:13:53.044 --> 00:13:56.107]  New video and photographic evidence that puts three senior C.I.A.
[00:13:56.207 --> 00:13:59.730]  operatives at the scene of Robert Kennedy's assassination has been brought to light.
[00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:05.074]  The evidence was shown in a report by Shane O'Sullivan broadcast on BBC Newsnight.
[00:14:05.975 --> 00:14:15.883]  It reveals that the operatives and four unidentified associates were at the Ambassador Hotel Los Angeles in the moments before and after the shooting on June 5th, 1968.
[00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:16.403]  The C.I.A.
[00:14:16.423 --> 00:14:16.824]  had no domestic
[00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:29.072]  Justification, and some of the officers were based in Southeast Asia at the time with no reason to be in Los Angeles.
[00:14:29.432 --> 00:14:29.972]  Decoy.
[00:14:31.473 --> 00:14:40.599]  Kennedy had just won the California Democratic primary on anti-war ticket and was set to challenge Nixon for the White House when he was shot in a kitchen pantry.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:50.346]  A 24-year-old Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan was arrested as the lone assassin and notebooks at his house seemed to incriminate him.
[00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:58.150]  And then, of course, he was a mental patient who'd been under CIA doctor's care at facilities.
[00:14:59.411 --> 00:15:04.933]  And then everyone witnessed this gorgeous woman in the polka-dotted dress giving him the special coffee, clearly his handler.
[00:15:06.353 --> 00:15:11.115]  He goes into the amnesic, probably liquid, Halcyon-type drug.
[00:15:11.936 --> 00:15:14.177]  Total amnesic, they give it to you when they pull your wisdom teeth.
[00:15:15.897 --> 00:15:20.179]  You can tell someone as they're coming out of it what has happened to them, and they'll repeat it back to you.
[00:15:21.991 --> 00:15:24.133]  It's what you mainly are given in sedation dentistry.
[00:15:24.153 --> 00:15:27.535]  I mean, these are just simple drugs that have been around for 50 years that do this.
[00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:29.057]  They put it in his drink.
[00:15:29.717 --> 00:15:31.619]  He went and just saw her putting something in his drink.
[00:15:32.279 --> 00:15:37.003]  And then he walks in and starts shooting at the ceiling as he was programmed to do.
[00:15:37.163 --> 00:15:41.266]  Shooting, no, because it would have been a problem and more of an investigation if he'd have shot others missing.
[00:15:41.747 --> 00:15:45.770]  So he shoots up as he's ordered to, as he'd been carefully programmed to, and then
[00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:58.014]  Happily just goes with them and admits he did it all, and it's all incriminated, just like the hijackers' bags on repeated flights were the only bags that got stuck in the luggage machines.
[00:15:58.914 --> 00:15:59.694]  They got stuck.
[00:15:59.774 --> 00:16:00.995]  They fell off the rack.
[00:16:01.675 --> 00:16:02.975]  They didn't make it to the planes.
[00:16:03.675 --> 00:16:11.637]  And their cars, and with their confessions, and their two passports fell out of the fireballs at the North and South Tower and fell to the ground and were found.
[00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:12.797]  Not one, two!
[00:16:16.497 --> 00:16:28.003]  It's of course it's all an accident, but now it's admitted CIA high-level black op commanders involved in Southeast Asian narcotics trafficking fly in and they're there.
[00:16:29.384 --> 00:16:37.469]  Of course witnesses said they saw one of these guys behind him pull a gun out and shoot him in the back, but it doesn't matter if you have witnesses that saw them shoot him in the back.
[00:16:38.969 --> 00:16:43.432]  It doesn't matter if you have the LA coroner saying he was shot in the back by different caliber.
[00:16:46.383 --> 00:16:47.464]  None of that matters.
[00:16:49.444 --> 00:16:53.726]  In front of everyone, McVeigh is driving erratically.
[00:16:54.067 --> 00:16:55.327]  The state police pull him over.
[00:16:55.387 --> 00:17:02.230]  No license plates on either end of the bizarre, you know, super old bomber-type vehicle.
[00:17:06.012 --> 00:17:08.273]  Kind of an off-eggshell yellow color.
[00:17:09.013 --> 00:17:10.374]  With Bondo all over it.
[00:17:10.854 --> 00:17:12.194]  The most obvious car you can pick.
[00:17:12.694 --> 00:17:13.755]  He's drooling.
[00:17:13.835 --> 00:17:15.055]  This was in the Daily Upload.
[00:17:15.376 --> 00:17:18.917]  He stumbles out and begins drooling, saying, it hurts, it hurts.
[00:17:19.437 --> 00:17:20.818]  Tell him, take the chip out.
[00:17:22.198 --> 00:17:23.879]  And see, those are key words in mind control.
[00:17:23.899 --> 00:17:26.940]  And he also, of course, had a cell phone with him.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.303]  They just call up and say, it's just like the Bourne ultimatum.
[00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:34.163]  You watch that movie?
[00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.352]  They call in the army captain, they say, are you committed to this program?
[00:17:38.372 --> 00:17:40.094]  You've already signed the papers, you're sure you're committed?
[00:17:40.374 --> 00:17:41.154]  He says, yes sir.
[00:17:41.475 --> 00:17:41.755]  Whom?
[00:17:41.855 --> 00:17:42.956]  Black bag over the head.
[00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:43.596]  Whom?
[00:17:43.856 --> 00:17:53.523]  Hardcore waterboarding, torture, LSD, PCP, constant torture, six months, a year, reprogramming, training, keywords, different compartmentalized personalities.
[00:17:54.163 --> 00:17:56.805]  That was all declassified in the 70s, they had that.
[00:17:58.526 --> 00:18:02.289]  In Korea, they were breaking our troops, turning them into absolute zombies.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:19.342]  But as if that isn't enough, that he's stumbling around saying, and it isn't like he didn't really have a chip probably, that's a key... They want to give you something psychological to associate it with.
[00:18:19.382 --> 00:18:22.243]  It's like they create a schizophrenia that they can turn on, you understand?
[00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:37.687]  And then, your mind psychosomatically creates the nausea, the hysteria, the flashbacks, the deep pre-programmed areas in your mind from just super intense torture.
[00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:42.859]  In an hallucinogenic state.
[00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:46.060]  They also give you drugs to make you nauseous while it's happening.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.282]  Amphetamine injections to heighten the awareness.
[00:18:50.002 --> 00:18:53.183]  So that you have hyper awareness of pain.
[00:18:53.784 --> 00:18:56.445]  Taking you to levels unknown to the average person.
[00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:57.625]  Unnatural.
[00:18:59.906 --> 00:19:01.427]  But as if that wasn't obvious enough.
[00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:14.324]  From the time he's arrested, Jolly and West, in the 1977 MKUltra hearings, running the program with Dr. Ewing Cameron, kidnapping more than 10,000 women and children in the U.S.
[00:19:14.364 --> 00:19:16.426]  and Canada for CIA mind-control programs.
[00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:17.447]  You know that's declassified?
[00:19:18.428 --> 00:19:18.708]  More than 10,000.
[00:19:18.888 --> 00:19:20.650]  20-plus year program.
[00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:29.558]  He comes out of retirement, goes and lives in Denver for the trial, visits him every day in his cell, and is with him to the day he dies at Terre Haute, Indiana.
[00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:38.096]  The greatest living legend of mind control is McVeigh's doctor.
[00:19:40.898 --> 00:19:42.680]  Incidentally, he died a few years after that.
[00:19:44.901 --> 00:19:47.624]  Are you beginning to realize what we're dealing with here?
[00:19:48.564 --> 00:19:49.225]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:55.868 --> 00:19:57.909]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:07.474]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:08.015 --> 00:20:15.119]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:21.324]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.825 --> 00:20:32.655]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:33.415 --> 00:20:35.457]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:39.761 --> 00:20:41.222]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:42.564]  A new world order.
[00:20:42.624 --> 00:20:49.430]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:04.307 --> 00:21:06.229]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.172]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.732 --> 00:21:12.155]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:12.895 --> 00:21:20.242]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:23.257 --> 00:21:28.220]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.701 --> 00:21:32.143]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:32.563 --> 00:21:35.045]  The Americans are making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:36.266]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:36.286 --> 00:21:37.066]  They're not after money.
[00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:38.147]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:38.367 --> 00:21:39.068]  They're after power.
[00:21:39.348 --> 00:21:40.148]  That's what they're after.

[00:24:07.034 --> 00:24:11.838]  The government tried to have mind control programs to create supermen, super soldiers.
[00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:19.243]  They proved under drugs and hypnosis, they could take somebody who could bench press 400 pounds, they could bench press 1000 pounds.
[00:24:19.283 --> 00:24:25.927]  You know, somebody that could squat 500 pounds could squat 2000 pounds.
[00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:31.691]  Because the brain has an automatic switch in it, a governor.
[00:24:32.732 --> 00:24:36.495]  But stuff like born identity, born supremacy, born ultimatum,
[00:24:38.462 --> 00:24:42.265]  It doesn't create those type of super soldiers from the info that's leaked out and we've gotten.
[00:24:42.325 --> 00:25:01.301]  What it does create is screwed up, messed up people who will drive a truck in with a bomb in it and then come out and drool, or go into a school and shoot a bunch of people and then blow their own head off, or who will just sit... I mean, you would watch McVane in those interviews.
[00:25:01.321 --> 00:25:06.665]  He was completely drugged out, completely out of his gourd, with his mind control doctor sitting right beside him.
[00:25:06.685 --> 00:25:07.966]  I mean, they've got to stay on him.
[00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:32.945]  Just like when our troops would get up and they would believe it in Vietnam and when North Korea would capture them, they would get up and believe and say America was evil and of course at the time it wasn't as evil as it is now and in a way it was but they in truth thought it was good before but now really believed it was bad and a few of them were hard to break and the famous cases of blinking with Morse code, torture, torture, torture.
[00:25:34.665 --> 00:25:37.346]  But what is mind control?
[00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.780]  Well, mind control's real simple.
[00:25:44.282 --> 00:25:46.923]  You see this with women who've been beaten a lot by their husband.
[00:25:47.824 --> 00:25:51.627]  And the guy goes to comb his hair and raises his hand to comb his hair and the woman flinches.
[00:25:51.987 --> 00:25:53.208]  You'll see that in restaurants.
[00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:54.949]  You'll see that on the street.
[00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.132]  Or parents that beat their kids a lot.
[00:25:58.172 --> 00:26:04.136]  You'll see little kids that... You've been around people where they'll move to comb their hair or move to put their glasses on and the kid flinches?
[00:26:06.818 --> 00:26:08.219]  Or if a dog's been beaten a lot.
[00:26:09.002 --> 00:26:10.803]  And you move your hand, it'll run.
[00:26:10.823 --> 00:26:20.188]  If you're a puppy training a dog, and you've just got the newspaper, and you're barely even whacking them with it, but you know, it's just to train them, they see a magazine, they get upset.
[00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:21.829]  That's mind control.
[00:26:21.989 --> 00:26:29.113]  And they make it real fancy, and oh, it's scientific, and there's wires in your brain, and the rest of it.
[00:26:29.353 --> 00:26:30.574]  And they have moved on to that.
[00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:56.001]  They've moved on where they can have a rat, a cockroach, a human, with electrodes, uh, not talk, according to the stuff that's declassified, I'm sure they can now, but what we know, 20 years ago, because they declassified every few decades, is they can hook wires into your head with remote control and have you walk around, shoot guns, drive cars, they can hit a button, make you urinate, make you fall asleep, make you vomit, make you feel euphoric.
[00:26:57.621 --> 00:26:58.682]  Now that's electronic.
[00:26:59.611 --> 00:27:01.753]  And so, that's cybernetic a little different.
[00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:05.296]  Most of the mind control has just been in basic Pavlovian torture.
[00:27:08.158 --> 00:27:14.023]  And let me tell you, they torture you for six months and then say a key word when the torture begins, you'll become upset.
[00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:15.104]  You'll start stumbling around.
[00:27:15.124 --> 00:27:16.044]  You'll start throwing up.
[00:27:16.064 --> 00:27:17.025]  You'll fall to your knees.
[00:27:17.866 --> 00:27:27.934]  Or, when they say the happy word when the drugs are taken off and the opiates are given to you and you feel okay, when they say that key word, you're going to feel great.
[00:27:33.994 --> 00:27:42.440]  And so, here I am, spent 20 minutes on this, but it's an important subject, and now I've digressed, and I've got so many guests coming up, I don't know how I'm going to get to all of this now.
[00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:52.928]  But you can go to PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, and read, CIA Role Claiming Kennedy Killing, and then just come out and admit, page after page, that the government basically killed him.
[00:27:53.889 --> 00:28:02.155]  And there's a whole other NBC report from the forensics admitting the government killed him, but... Here's the other type of news we have.
[00:28:03.283 --> 00:28:05.785]  Defense Secretary Gates orders inventory of U.S.
[00:28:05.805 --> 00:28:10.029]  nukes because they're getting flown here, they're getting flown here, they're lost there.
[00:28:10.469 --> 00:28:12.631]  They're putting all this out now for a reason.
[00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:14.873]  This is very, this is a big concern.
[00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:21.138]  They wouldn't be letting these stories out of fuses going to the wrong place and nukes going to the wrong place.
[00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:23.000]  There wasn't a reason and something stinks.
[00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:28.885]  And all I can say is heaven help us because these people don't just cold-bloodedly kill, they like to kill.
[00:28:29.975 --> 00:28:39.438]  So Defense Secretary Robert Gates has ordered a full inventory of nuclear weapons and related materials after a mistaken delivery of ballistic missile fuses to Taiwan, the Pentagon said Thursday.
[00:28:40.738 --> 00:28:41.979]  I love how they call them fuses.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:45.840]  It's not what they are.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.882]  Iraq puts Baghdad under weekend curfew, all part of the freedom.
[00:28:51.962 --> 00:28:57.804]  Airport security forces woman to remove nipple ring with pliers, but she had a belly button ring they left alone.
[00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:01.140]  And it's reported that they were laughing at her.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.581]  And of course the skin grew over it so she had to rip it out.
[00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:08.522]  I experienced this at LAX.
[00:29:08.562 --> 00:29:13.323]  I'm politely... It was like a year ago.
[00:29:13.343 --> 00:29:14.423]  A year and a half ago.
[00:29:15.683 --> 00:29:16.764]  It dropped out of the airport.
[00:29:18.764 --> 00:29:18.944]  And I...
[00:29:23.524 --> 00:29:25.565]  By the way, I just bought new shoes for you guys before.
[00:29:25.665 --> 00:29:26.526]  My feet don't stink.
[00:29:26.986 --> 00:29:28.207]  Because I changed socks twice today.
[00:29:28.227 --> 00:29:29.547]  But the point is, my feet don't smell.
[00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:34.770]  And I took my shoes off, put them in the scanner to be humiliated, to be habitualized, to be trained, to be a slave.
[00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.211]  And the guys just said, oh, look at Mr. Stinky Feet.

[00:29:40.253 --> 00:29:41.173]  By the way, no metal bleep.
[00:29:41.533 --> 00:29:42.814]  It's all part of humiliation.
[00:29:42.834 --> 00:29:43.454]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:45.235 --> 00:29:46.156]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:48.217]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.157 --> 00:29:51.839]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.037 --> 00:30:00.000]  It's progressing, and it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.

[00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:55.155]  Fact.
[00:30:55.335 --> 00:31:01.238]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:31:01.378 --> 00:31:05.641]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:31:05.721 --> 00:31:13.224]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:31:13.424 --> 00:31:14.085]  The solution.
[00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:18.167]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[00:31:57.037 --> 00:31:59.058]  of the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:31:59.458 --> 00:32:02.439]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:32:02.499 --> 00:32:03.159]  is a real thing.

[00:32:21.263 --> 00:32:21.764]  We're good to go.

[00:32:46.108 --> 00:32:49.609]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:26.752]  You have found it, my friends, the front line of the Infowar.
[00:33:28.432 --> 00:33:30.513]  All of us are brothers and sisters together.
[00:33:30.533 --> 00:33:46.156]  No matter where you live across the planet, we love liberty, we hate tyranny, we love decency and honor and the average person being able to live their life without some parasite feeding on you.
[00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:48.672]  And we are everywhere.
[00:33:48.712 --> 00:33:55.777]  We're in every business, every law enforcement agency, every government operation, every university.
[00:33:55.917 --> 00:33:59.900]  Our people are legion, and they are growing every single day.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.021]  And so remember that.
[00:34:01.782 --> 00:34:03.323]  The enemy is scared to death.
[00:34:03.403 --> 00:34:08.667]  I've done my own analysis for many different gauges that we have.
[00:34:09.418 --> 00:34:14.623]  To know how big our movement is, and it's almost unmeasurable it's so large and growing so fast.
[00:34:15.104 --> 00:34:18.467]  But there are billions of people that now know about the New World Order.
[00:34:18.988 --> 00:34:20.710]  There are billions of people.
[00:34:21.691 --> 00:34:27.977]  I would have to say about 35-40% of the world's population has a good idea now, exactly what we're facing.
[00:34:28.908 --> 00:34:30.729]  But we still feel like we're alone.
[00:34:30.769 --> 00:34:33.351]  We still feel like other people aren't aware of it.
[00:34:33.391 --> 00:34:39.316]  That final illusion is starting to collapse, though, and as it collapses, it will fall that much faster.
[00:34:39.336 --> 00:34:40.597]  I'm going to talk more about that in a moment.
[00:34:43.779 --> 00:34:58.170]  But now, getting back to airport security, they hire these poor folks for eight, ten bucks an hour, and you go to some airports, and they're nice, they're friendly, they're professional,
[00:35:01.212 --> 00:35:05.994]  But you go to others and it is just a culture of abuse.
[00:35:07.275 --> 00:35:21.543]  I have witnessed with my own eyeballs at the San Francisco airport some group called Wolverine Security.
[00:35:21.583 --> 00:35:29.947]  They were wearing kind of bright blue Cobra Commander type battle dress fatigues.
[00:35:30.911 --> 00:35:34.153]  With yellow highlights.
[00:35:35.394 --> 00:35:36.435]  They were all foreigners.
[00:35:39.037 --> 00:35:41.239]  It looked like it was predominantly Vietnamese.
[00:35:42.459 --> 00:35:47.343]  And they were, with abandon, jabbing, pushing, interrogating, gibbering.
[00:35:47.363 --> 00:35:51.526]  I say gibbering because it wasn't even good English.
[00:35:52.527 --> 00:35:57.090]  At old people, women, a World War II vet.
[00:35:57.845 --> 00:35:59.146]  A group of them were getting on the plane.
[00:35:59.186 --> 00:36:00.646]  One of them had oxygen tanks.
[00:36:00.726 --> 00:36:01.307]  I've told the story.
[00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:02.287]  Looked like he was about to die.
[00:36:02.607 --> 00:36:03.708]  I guarantee he died within a year.
[00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:04.388]  I mean, he looked bad.
[00:36:04.968 --> 00:36:05.829]  Could barely walk.
[00:36:06.649 --> 00:36:08.110]  Had his elderly wife helping him.
[00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:12.072]  They were pushing along the oxygen tank.
[00:36:14.653 --> 00:36:19.295]  And, uh, they would search you... I think it was 2002.
[00:36:20.015 --> 00:36:22.477]  Once you'd gone through the gates, but then again,
[00:36:24.438 --> 00:36:27.940]  Randomly going onto the plane, right before he went on the plane.
[00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:30.001]  At the gate.
[00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:32.943]  Not just going through the terminals.
[00:36:36.585 --> 00:36:48.591]  And I've been in airports, I've been to the Austin Airport, where some guy was reading a book that looked like something out of 1984, it was a black covered book with white lettering saying, it said, How Someone Becomes a Terrorist.
[00:36:50.272 --> 00:36:51.933]  And see, it's a culture of paranoia.
[00:36:53.270 --> 00:37:03.257]  And so to keep those guys going and not completely bored, they'll ban lighters, they'll ban matches, then later it's fluids, then later it's how much fluids you can have.
[00:37:03.297 --> 00:37:06.099]  At first, again, it's dog training.
[00:37:06.179 --> 00:37:12.423]  Every fourth, fifth person until about 2004, they want you to take your shoes off if the beeper went off.
[00:37:12.483 --> 00:37:14.084]  And then it's everybody.
[00:37:16.065 --> 00:37:18.927]  And then it's, oh, and I've got the TSA thing here.
[00:37:18.967 --> 00:37:22.309]  I mean, if you've got piercings and your skin grows over them,
[00:37:23.542 --> 00:37:25.103]  They make you take them out with pliers.
[00:37:26.264 --> 00:37:27.425]  They have pliers there for it.
[00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:30.267]  Or you don't have to fly.
[00:37:30.628 --> 00:37:39.215]  But soon it'll be, you don't have to have a job, you don't have to drive a car, you don't have to... Very soon you get on the road and you're not paid up and don't have your national ID card in order, the car will turn off.
[00:37:39.675 --> 00:37:43.238]  Bare minimum, the cameras will scan your license plate and the police will be dispatched.
[00:37:43.598 --> 00:37:44.979]  That's official and that's the new system.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.222]  Life will be like the airports.
[00:37:52.088 --> 00:37:55.830]  But people say it's ridiculous, the TSA is stupid, the government are morons.
[00:37:57.571 --> 00:38:07.877]  Well, the guys and gals that believe all this is for security are morons, but the Pavlovian psychological warfare experts know this is part of your journey into slavery.
[00:38:07.957 --> 00:38:09.098]  You are being acclimated.
[00:38:09.818 --> 00:38:10.519]  They've written about it.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.223]  And if you can be made to remove your piercings from your breast,
[00:38:18.695 --> 00:38:21.537]  If you can be made to remove piercings from other places, I won't mention.
[00:38:22.038 --> 00:38:29.923]  If you can be made to have women and men, and there's been a lot of cases of this in the news, where the men like to, and I've seen it, good looking women are in trouble.
[00:38:29.943 --> 00:38:31.485]  I mean, if you're a perv, it's where you get a job.
[00:38:32.485 --> 00:38:33.586]  It's been like that throughout history.
[00:38:35.768 --> 00:38:42.873]  Pregnant women are made to pull up their shirts and show their bellies in front of people, and then the woman cries, so they arrest her.
[00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:45.315]  The husband complains, so they beat him up.
[00:38:48.137 --> 00:38:49.538]  That was in the major papers.
[00:38:50.818 --> 00:38:52.039]  That's just one case of hundreds.
[00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:52.879]  I see them every day.
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.721]  Five, six-year-olds are tasered for arguing.
[00:38:56.041 --> 00:38:58.022]  People who don't give urine samples are tasered.
[00:38:58.342 --> 00:38:59.143]  Pain compliance.
[00:38:59.183 --> 00:39:00.483]  Torture is legal in this country.
[00:39:01.264 --> 00:39:03.765]  Of course, it's illegal, but they criminally say it's legal.
[00:39:05.306 --> 00:39:06.266]  It's their policy.
[00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:13.490]  And so, it's about making you do things that are stupid and ridiculous.
[00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.931]  I saw a report Monday
[00:39:16.539 --> 00:39:37.404]  I never covered out of the London Telegraph just type buses must stop every 30 minutes under EU rules and the European Union makes all buses stop every 30 minutes and everyone must get off to make sure the bus driver doesn't fall asleep.
[00:39:38.524 --> 00:39:41.085]  See they take something that sounds reasonable
[00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:51.299]  But then they set international laws under it, and once you're trained to do something that sounds reasonable but is really ridiculous, then you'll follow any other orders.
[00:39:51.359 --> 00:39:52.299]  It's habitualization.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:40:04.547]  You know, I was on Talk Sport Monday for two hours, and I was listening to ads run by the government, by the EU,
[00:40:05.763 --> 00:40:08.505]  Saying, you know, stop every 30 minutes, be safe.
[00:40:09.005 --> 00:40:12.768]  This causes hundreds of deaths a year, people falling asleep, and it does.
[00:40:12.788 --> 00:40:15.510]  I thought, there's some government angle to this.
[00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:25.056]  So while the show was going, I googled new rules on drivers sleeping.
[00:40:25.897 --> 00:40:31.461]  And then all this stuff came up where the police are watching, they stop the bus every 30 minutes, everybody gets off.
[00:40:32.802 --> 00:40:33.262]  It's about
[00:40:34.344 --> 00:40:42.147]  Being micromanaged, totally controlled, and then once the silliness is set, once the silly precedent is set, everything else can flow.
[00:40:43.767 --> 00:40:56.712]  So once you've been trained to take your shoes off, and be fondled, and take piercings out, and put the borders wide open, and they give illegal aliens any IDs they want, and the government accepts consular matricular cards, on its face it's a fraud.
[00:40:56.752 --> 00:40:57.712]  It's not about terror.
[00:41:00.173 --> 00:41:02.974]  It's not about keeping you safe from the boogeyman.
[00:41:06.084 --> 00:41:13.947]  And I know I've made this point, everybody's made this point, but we need to write articles about this, we need to point out this basic psychology so people understand, because they keep saying it's so dumb.
[00:41:16.008 --> 00:41:26.432]  Explosive experts go on the news and say, well it would take several hours with chemicals that they're talking about to go in the bathroom and make these explosives, and then they wouldn't be very high-powered explosives.
[00:41:28.453 --> 00:41:30.714]  You know, first it's you've got to drink out of the water.
[00:41:31.465 --> 00:41:32.286]  When you carry it on.
[00:41:32.746 --> 00:41:34.867]  And then it's about being eyed.
[00:41:34.927 --> 00:41:36.188]  It's about being questioned.
[00:41:36.628 --> 00:41:39.110]  It's about being shoved up against a wall.
[00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.811]  It's about showing papers.
[00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:42.772]  It's about being prepared.
[00:41:42.852 --> 00:41:46.235]  And now they're saying they want to put similar security in malls.
[00:41:46.275 --> 00:41:47.235]  They want to put it on the streets.
[00:41:47.616 --> 00:41:48.216]  The schools.
[00:41:48.256 --> 00:41:49.757]  Thumbscaling to get school lunches.
[00:41:49.797 --> 00:41:52.759]  Thumbprinting to clock into jobs.
[00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:54.620]  Thumbprinting to get library books.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.762]  Thumbprinting to go to the gym.
[00:41:57.802 --> 00:41:58.663]  The tanning salon.
[00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:00.124]  Thumbprinting to go to the megachurch.
[00:42:01.044 --> 00:42:02.664]  That's all to be part of the Casual Society.
[00:42:03.584 --> 00:42:04.625]  As I told you 10 years ago.
[00:42:05.625 --> 00:42:10.706]  Now 11 years ago, excuse me, in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:42:15.547 --> 00:42:24.388]  And then they announce, we're gonna have them on the streets, the Viper teams, in Dallas, in Houston, in L.A., Miami.
[00:42:24.788 --> 00:42:26.449]  Just randomly searching, randomly.
[00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:27.309]  And then New York.
[00:42:28.101 --> 00:42:32.802]  Over 500,000 in 2007, random stop and searches.
[00:42:32.843 --> 00:42:35.383]  They just pull cars over randomly.
[00:42:35.683 --> 00:42:37.544]  We've got video of this in the upcoming film.
[00:42:37.564 --> 00:42:43.966]  I haven't chosen a name yet for it, but just where they just block off a major street in New York, they just search everybody.
[00:42:48.327 --> 00:42:50.288]  Just like when you go get a bank account now, it's
[00:42:51.698 --> 00:42:53.760]  Like you're joining the FBI or something.
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.402]  Background checks, 20 questions, spying on you.
[00:42:56.482 --> 00:43:00.806]  Of course they don't tell you, hey slave, we're reporting everything you're doing to the government.
[00:43:00.826 --> 00:43:01.907]  It's all uploaded to the government.
[00:43:02.087 --> 00:43:03.008]  You go in to have a baby.
[00:43:03.308 --> 00:43:04.990]  They're hooked into the health department with a computer.
[00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:06.511]  Reporting everything you're doing.
[00:43:06.872 --> 00:43:07.792]  Asking you questions.
[00:43:07.853 --> 00:43:18.162]  Not telling you this is going right to, not even the police who still have some due process, but to the other tier, the Social Worker Guild they set up a hundred years ago to carry out eugenics.
[00:43:19.867 --> 00:43:20.868]  You got a good environment?
[00:43:20.908 --> 00:43:21.868]  Your husband nice to you?
[00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:23.349]  Huh?
[00:43:23.389 --> 00:43:23.990]  Tell me the truth.
[00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:24.590]  You can trust me.
[00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:26.251]  I always tell them to leave.
[00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:27.071]  I'm your friend.
[00:43:27.131 --> 00:43:27.432]  Tell me.
[00:43:28.712 --> 00:43:29.293]  I'm your friend.
[00:43:29.533 --> 00:43:30.533]  They're not your friend.
[00:43:35.356 --> 00:43:40.099]  They've all been habitualized to be little spooks and little tattletales and they all enjoy it.
[00:43:40.139 --> 00:43:44.422]  It's their little power position for the betterment of society.
[00:43:44.782 --> 00:43:46.063]  They're professionals.
[00:43:51.457 --> 00:43:59.723]  Yeah, they professionally took over a thousand times the amount of blood thickening vitamin that they demand that they give your baby.
[00:44:00.924 --> 00:44:03.345]  And they give it to Dennis Quaid and his kids almost die.
[00:44:04.546 --> 00:44:05.107]  To his kids.
[00:44:06.568 --> 00:44:09.570]  And they kill more people in the hospitals every year than automobiles do.
[00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:11.952]  From just drug interactions.
[00:44:12.632 --> 00:44:15.274]  But it doesn't matter, they're perfect, they're good.
[00:44:15.774 --> 00:44:17.476]  Everything's merging into the government.
[00:44:19.297 --> 00:44:20.878]  All internationally standardized.
[00:44:23.306 --> 00:44:38.591]  Mandy Hamlin, 37, is demanding a civil rights investigation as well as an apology from federal security agents after being forced to remove a nipple ring before boarding a flight from Lubbock to Dallas in Texas.
[00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:40.471]  During a press conference, Ms.
[00:44:40.491 --> 00:44:47.893]  Hamlin said she was scammed by a Female Transportation Security Administration agent using a handheld detector that beeped when it passed in front of her chest.
[00:44:48.934 --> 00:44:52.635]  Then it goes into how they drug her behind closed doors, made her pull it out with pliers,
[00:44:53.843 --> 00:44:54.483]  Laughed at her.
[00:44:54.503 --> 00:44:58.825]  And you know what it was like to take my shoes off?
[00:45:00.546 --> 00:45:04.228]  Walk over where thousands of people had walked with all their athlete's foot, all their germs?
[00:45:04.808 --> 00:45:06.709]  Somebody ought to make an issue of that to try to stop it.
[00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.171]  See, it's all selectively enforced.
[00:45:11.252 --> 00:45:16.214]  They'll have you ninnying about something else environmental, everybody with hand sanitizers everywhere, wiping neurotically.
[00:45:17.685 --> 00:45:23.846]  Obsessive compulsively, but then you're going to walk across where everybody else from the whole planet in LAX has been walking.
[00:45:23.866 --> 00:45:26.527]  And then they just say, oh, you know, you didn't beep.
[00:45:26.587 --> 00:45:27.447]  We're going to scan you.
[00:45:27.487 --> 00:45:28.207]  Come on over here.
[00:45:28.607 --> 00:45:29.447]  They start waving the wand.
[00:45:29.467 --> 00:45:31.488]  They go, mist, come on, Mr. Stinky Feet.
[00:45:32.028 --> 00:45:33.468]  Oh, he got stinky feet.
[00:45:36.508 --> 00:45:40.389]  And I guess they were black guys who'd been teased by whites when they were kids, big black guys.
[00:45:40.409 --> 00:45:42.289]  So it was fun to, and I forgive them.
[00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:45.150]  They're just brainwashed, poor, pathetic slaves like everybody else.
[00:45:46.087 --> 00:45:46.928]  I didn't even get mad.
[00:45:46.988 --> 00:45:47.869]  I was really sad.
[00:45:47.949 --> 00:45:52.152]  I almost started crying, because I realized this country's completely gone.
[00:45:52.972 --> 00:45:54.514]  Mr. Stinky Feet!
[00:45:54.934 --> 00:45:56.235]  Come on, Mr. Stinky Feet!
[00:45:56.255 --> 00:45:57.256]  He got Stinky Feet!
[00:45:57.316 --> 00:45:58.777]  Yeah, he got Stinky Feet!
[00:46:00.919 --> 00:46:09.225]  And I looked at him with sadness, and they just kind of shamefully went off to somebody else, but... Oh, Mr. Stinky Feet.
[00:46:10.306 --> 00:46:11.467]  He got to Stinky Feet.
[00:46:15.494 --> 00:46:17.275]  Her nipple ring!
[00:46:18.516 --> 00:46:20.817]  Oh, she doesn't like having it removed!
[00:46:22.557 --> 00:46:26.759]  And they're not going to like getting right into the pits either when the soldiers shoot them in the back of the head.
[00:46:27.299 --> 00:46:30.141]  But the soldiers like it because they're on the winning team.
[00:46:32.862 --> 00:46:34.082]  And they've been trained to do it.
[00:46:34.863 --> 00:46:37.644]  And the grandsons of the people that financed it all run the nation.
[00:46:39.955 --> 00:46:42.157]  And so they make a big deal about this in the news.
[00:46:42.217 --> 00:46:49.022]  So see, when you're just having to have your shoes off and be in question, you won't feel as bad, because after all, they make women take their piercings out.
[00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:51.664]  Here's another one.
[00:46:51.724 --> 00:46:53.465]  Spy drones in demand by U.S.
[00:46:53.485 --> 00:46:56.007]  police departments, but approval pending.
[00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:03.173]  The Miami police could soon be cutting edge, flying drones to help fight crime.
[00:47:03.513 --> 00:47:04.194]  Oh, yes!
[00:47:05.034 --> 00:47:08.497]  Mounted with little infrared systems and sonar systems.
[00:47:11.297 --> 00:47:14.318]  They'd look right through your walls and give them nice images.
[00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:20.839]  The classified stuff's been color for decades, but the stuff they're now publicly deploying is a nice black and white image.
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.360]  And hey, let the helicopter fly in grids over your house.
[00:47:25.661 --> 00:47:31.262]  You see, the cops on the ground, they like the feds coming and advertising the new systems controlled by joysticks.
[00:47:31.742 --> 00:47:35.103]  Only weigh 20 pounds or so, so it's not too bad if it falls on somebody.
[00:47:35.563 --> 00:47:36.803]  So now the cops get to have them.
[00:47:37.464 --> 00:47:37.764]  L.A.
[00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:38.784]  for about four years,
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:44.041]  Uh, has been, without even FAA approval, has drones flying around everywhere, these little saucers.
[00:47:45.982 --> 00:47:47.543]  It's all part of the militarization.
[00:47:49.463 --> 00:47:55.985]  And it says, um, how Honeywell International and other defense contractors have got a new market, the police.
[00:47:58.586 --> 00:48:02.047]  Developer sues to win $12.3 billion.
[00:48:02.927 --> 00:48:05.708]  Larry Silverstein's already been paid out $4.6 billion.
[00:48:05.728 --> 00:48:07.889]  He's scheduled to get another $2 billion that's still been withheld.
[00:48:08.777 --> 00:48:16.701]  But he wants $12.3 billion from damages from airlines and airport security companies for the 9-11 attack.
[00:48:19.423 --> 00:48:26.307]  And of course the airlines themselves, the top three, were given $35 billion after the attacks as an aid package.
[00:48:27.167 --> 00:48:29.809]  More than those companies make profit together in five years.
[00:48:29.849 --> 00:48:30.629]  I crunched the number at the time.
[00:48:30.649 --> 00:48:32.010]  That was a payoff for a job well done.
[00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:33.791]  Then they were given billions more in supplement.
[00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:36.032]  This will just be another public payoff.
[00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:38.466]  Larry Silverstein for a job well done.
[00:48:38.486 --> 00:48:43.671]  Well, he's going to come out with over 17 billion dollars total when all is said and done.
[00:48:44.732 --> 00:48:48.075]  And that's just the payment for going along with the black op.
[00:48:51.438 --> 00:48:54.381]  Crime really does pay well, doesn't it, when you run the government.
[00:48:56.543 --> 00:48:59.886]  But criminals always go wild and start killing everybody en masse.
[00:48:59.906 --> 00:49:00.927]  That's why they always fall.
[00:49:03.712 --> 00:49:06.273]  But see, they need that thrill of doing something dangerous.
[00:49:06.334 --> 00:49:07.934]  Psychopaths always want to get caught.
[00:49:08.014 --> 00:49:11.336]  That's why they always do get caught down the road, because they get wilder and wilder.
[00:49:13.998 --> 00:49:15.199]  They get more and more reckless.
[00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:21.722]  Of course, we die in the process, but that's okay, isn't it?
[00:49:22.783 --> 00:49:25.765]  Call for new 9-11 investigation reaches crescendo.
[00:49:26.165 --> 00:49:31.068]  Public figures increasingly speaking out, while media ignores professionals and experts.
[00:49:32.558 --> 00:49:35.259]  Great article by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:35.279 --> 00:49:36.240]  I hope you get it out to everybody.
[00:49:37.521 --> 00:49:39.081]  This is an article that needs to get out to everybody.
[00:49:39.742 --> 00:49:57.291]  Calls for a new 9-11 inquiry are reaching a crescendo with well-respected authorities and celebrities alike adding their voices to the cause as the official 9-11 story crumbles under the weight of revelations of White House ties, 9-11 Commission, and other cover-ups on behalf of authorities staffed with investigating the attacks.
[00:49:58.931 --> 00:50:15.175]  The corporate media's insistence of ignoring hundreds of professional experts who are calling for a new 9-11 investigation has spurred many celebrities to use their public platforms to speak out, knowing that the press will at least have to address the issue.
[00:50:16.935 --> 00:50:18.735]  Because they are so celebrity obsessed.
[00:50:19.315 --> 00:50:21.736]  The latest to do so is top comedian Margaret Cho.
[00:50:23.143 --> 00:50:37.956]  Who told the Alex Jones Show yesterday that the public were going to become very angry when it was fully disclosed that the attacks were a conspiracy, concurred with fellow comedian George Carlin, who also questioned the official story last year.
[00:50:38.296 --> 00:50:46.323]  And then it just goes through the prime ministers, the presidents, the CIA section chiefs, the engineers, the physicists.
[00:50:47.224 --> 00:50:48.505]  Jesse Ventura!
[00:50:49.705 --> 00:50:51.926]  Yeah, we're coming for you, murderers!
[00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:53.547]  We're gonna get ya!
[00:50:55.188 --> 00:51:07.895]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:08.336 --> 00:51:12.158]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:51:12.498 --> 00:51:19.001]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:19.381 --> 00:51:22.582]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:22.802 --> 00:51:24.503]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[00:51:24.563 --> 00:51:30.306]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:52:55.143 --> 00:52:56.984]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:52:57.124 --> 00:53:02.305]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:53:02.485 --> 00:53:03.826]  But the symptoms are there.

[00:53:58.918 --> 00:54:00.519]  This show is documented.
[00:54:00.959 --> 00:54:10.062]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.402 --> 00:54:13.983]  This article that Paul Watson wrote is excellent.
[00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:15.404]  It's lengthy as well.
[00:54:16.024 --> 00:54:23.186]  I mean, it just goes through all the people that have gone public.
[00:54:23.747 --> 00:54:24.907]  I should just read this.
[00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:27.488]  Ed Asner.
[00:54:30.599 --> 00:54:32.861]  We've got Rick Linklater.
[00:54:32.921 --> 00:54:35.362]  I mean, the list just goes on and on.
[00:54:35.442 --> 00:54:36.683]  Best actress this year.
[00:54:37.584 --> 00:54:38.985]  Other Academy Award winners.
[00:54:43.107 --> 00:54:48.271]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:52.653]  And on top of it, separately, National U.S.
[00:54:52.693 --> 00:54:58.037]  News is reporting that all these top forensic scientists are saying that Kennedy was shot from behind.
[00:54:58.137 --> 00:54:59.678]  Well, the original coroner said that.
[00:55:00.572 --> 00:55:14.755]  And we have BBC coming out with a three-year investigation with photos and film of four top CIA operatives from Southeast Asia there around him, and that's what the witnesses saw and reported that one of these guys shot him in the back.
[00:55:15.875 --> 00:55:19.716]  It's been declassified that Israel attacked the USS Liberty on purpose.
[00:55:20.196 --> 00:55:23.636]  Chicago Tribune, Associated Press, never got any news after that.
[00:55:23.976 --> 00:55:24.636]  It's now admitted.
[00:55:25.217 --> 00:55:26.217]  Everything we always told you.
[00:55:26.637 --> 00:55:27.537]  Tried to blame it on Egypt.
[00:55:28.456 --> 00:55:29.757]  It's now been declassified.
[00:55:29.777 --> 00:55:32.840]  They said our government staged the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam.
[00:55:33.741 --> 00:55:34.842]  It came out within days.
[00:55:34.882 --> 00:55:40.226]  They staged the thing a few months ago where they claimed the Iranians were driving up in little motorboats saying we're gonna blow you up.
[00:55:40.526 --> 00:55:41.607]  Totally fake.
[00:55:41.667 --> 00:55:42.228]  Now admit it.
[00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:49.654]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cover-ups are being uncovered.
[00:55:49.714 --> 00:55:56.080]  And the same old men at the CIA and NSA just sit up there running their same old tricks on us.
[00:55:57.129 --> 00:55:59.451]  Over and thinking we're going to buy it.
[00:56:00.632 --> 00:56:02.694]  Over and over and over again.
[00:56:02.714 --> 00:56:11.961]  And I think they don't care because they're going to set off nukes or release bird flu or whatever they're going to do.
[00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:14.763]  Just everybody, none of us are safe until they all go to prison.
[00:56:14.803 --> 00:56:15.424]  You understand that?
[00:56:17.786 --> 00:56:18.907]  This isn't going to go away.
[00:56:18.967 --> 00:56:19.767]  It's not going to stop.
[00:56:20.108 --> 00:56:21.809]  We have to avert the next attack.
[00:56:22.169 --> 00:56:23.210]  We've got to stop it.
[00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.332]  Everything I do is to stop that next attack.
[00:56:25.939 --> 00:56:32.182]  The reason I went public before 9-11 and predicted it was because I saw them preparing the public to carry out the attack.
[00:56:32.802 --> 00:56:41.647]  I've always said we have to take false flag terrorism, that mechanism, their favorite tool, their favorite weapon, and we have to totally expose it and render it useless.
[00:56:42.007 --> 00:56:46.089]  And we've done that partially, but we haven't gone far enough.
[00:56:46.429 --> 00:56:47.790]  False flag terror.
[00:56:49.311 --> 00:56:53.653]  The 9-11 Truth Movement is the heart
[00:56:54.913 --> 00:56:59.056]  Of stopping the globalists and their problem reaction solution, Hegelian dialectic.
[00:57:01.137 --> 00:57:17.869]  If we do not have a universal understanding of that, and a universal discrediting of the private corporations that own and run the majority of the world's governments, and are mopping up the last few they don't right now, to focus in on exterminating the majority of humanity, and that's their statement not mine,
[00:57:19.381 --> 00:57:27.067]  If we do not expose their favorite tool, they're going to continue to beat the brush, to drive us out into the open, so that they can have their way with us.
[00:57:28.007 --> 00:57:40.156]  Ancients would beat drums, set fires, drive the elephants, the mammoths, the mastodons, over the cliffs, and then they could butcher them and have enough food for the winter.
[00:57:41.637 --> 00:57:48.302]  That's how they were extinct, most archaeologists and anthropologists, archaeologists believe.
[00:57:50.973 --> 00:57:53.754]  Just how they hunt pheasant in England today.
[00:57:53.794 --> 00:58:05.476]  They have beaters a few miles away get in a line and then they start beating and they come in kind of in a wedge, a V, and then they push out the birds at one point and hundreds will come flying out.
[00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:09.256]  That's all terrorism is.
[00:58:09.937 --> 00:58:12.157]  Now we're not pheasants and we're not elephants.
[00:58:13.037 --> 00:58:17.338]  Though elephants are magical creatures and very intelligent, they are not able to understand
[00:58:18.436 --> 00:58:21.758]  And they were made extinct, that form of pachyderm.
[00:58:24.559 --> 00:58:28.161]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're humans, we can fight back against these bad humans.
[00:58:29.342 --> 00:58:33.905]  They hit us with fluoride, tried to get the upper hand, but it's not working.
[00:58:36.466 --> 00:58:38.307]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:39.708 --> 00:58:43.390]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:45.551 --> 00:58:46.872]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:49.070]  A New World Order.
[00:58:49.771 --> 00:58:54.073]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:54.093 --> 00:58:56.794]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:57.494 --> 00:58:59.755]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:00.295 --> 00:59:02.716]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:03.477 --> 00:59:10.800]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.823 --> 00:59:18.786]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:19.266 --> 00:59:22.729]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:23.129 --> 00:59:25.610]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:25.711 --> 00:59:26.851]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:27.632]  They're not after money.
[00:59:27.652 --> 00:59:28.732]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.913 --> 00:59:29.653]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.913 --> 00:59:30.734]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.081]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:42.541 --> 00:59:43.824]  You have been warned.
[00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:49.573]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:50.034 --> 00:59:52.818]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.764 --> 00:59:59.845]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.506 --> 01:00:01.326]  You want answers?
[01:00:02.107 --> 01:00:02.988]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:07.231]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:11.915]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:40.170]  We're going to be talking to a guest who runs a little newspaper up in Maine, but he did more than all the mainstream media has done combined.
[01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:51.496]  He went out and investigated the larger ramifications of an announcement made a month ago of
[01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:54.880]  The Canadian and U.S.
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.102]  military saying that they will use each other's foreign troops on domestic soil.
[01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.804]  So that is coming up.
[01:01:05.706 --> 01:01:11.409]  But before we go any further, I wanted to just play this clip because I've come across it and somebody sent it to me again.
[01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:22.175]  This is earlier this year, Sarah Taylor, former White House political director,
[01:01:25.009 --> 01:01:30.770]  And you hear Bush say, my government, my government, and you hear Cheney say, I don't care what 80% of the public want.
[01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:35.151]  You get your input every four years, we can do whatever we want.
[01:01:35.171 --> 01:01:40.592]  We can torture, we can torture kids, we can take your Bill of Rights, we can legalize illegals, we can go after your guns.
[01:01:41.112 --> 01:01:42.252]  No, we have a Bill of Rights.
[01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:45.953]  In a republic, the basic rights are protected.
[01:01:46.253 --> 01:01:49.873]  And if 51% want slavery, you can't, because you can't violate the rights of the 49%.
[01:01:49.913 --> 01:01:54.394]  That's the difference between a pure democracy and a constitutional republic.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.203]  And the White House, the executive, is the weakest of the three branches.
[01:02:00.263 --> 01:02:03.005]  It goes legislative, judicial, executive.
[01:02:03.105 --> 01:02:10.450]  If you really read the debates when it was all founded and set up, the executive is told what to do with the laws, basically, by the Congress.
[01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:11.290]  They declare war.
[01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:14.593]  And then the court sits there and referees between the two.
[01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:19.996]  Because you have the greatest separation of powers in the Congress.
[01:02:20.016 --> 01:02:21.137]  At the time, senators were
[01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:29.363]  Elected by the legislatures they were sent by the state's creatures of the states, but look I Don't want to confuse everybody with the facts.
[01:02:29.423 --> 01:02:47.850]  Let's just play her basically saying George Bush is God You ready with the Sarah Taylor clip John That's the Yes, that's the clip all right there we go
[01:02:50.359 --> 01:02:53.582]  I was looking over my notes during the break, Ms.
[01:02:53.602 --> 01:03:01.088]  Taylor, and I was really struck by one of your answers.
[01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:04.431]  I don't know the answer to your question.
[01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:08.595]  I will say, Senator, I was a deputy assistant to the president.
[01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:10.377]  I was a commissioned officer.
[01:03:10.397 --> 01:03:16.242]  I took an oath, and I take that oath to the president very seriously.
[01:03:18.605 --> 01:03:25.529]  I know the President said recently, he referred to our government as his government.
[01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:26.669]  He said, my government.
[01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:34.413]  Most of us always assume it's the government of all of us, not just of one individual.
[01:03:34.433 --> 01:03:41.197]  It was almost a monarchy kind of question, kind of answer that he gave, although it may explain a lot of things.
[01:03:42.297 --> 01:03:45.679]  And then you said, I took a note to the President
[01:03:46.939 --> 01:03:49.091]  I take that oath very seriously.
[01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:54.520]  Did you mean perhaps you took an oath to the Constitution?
[01:03:55.101 --> 01:03:56.301]  Yes, you're correct.
[01:03:56.362 --> 01:03:57.863]  I took an oath to the Constitution.
[01:03:57.883 --> 01:04:01.966]  Did you take a second oath to the President?
[01:04:02.026 --> 01:04:02.646]  I did not.
[01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:04.928]  The answer was incorrect.
[01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.209]  The answer was incorrect.
[01:04:06.229 --> 01:04:06.909]  Thank you.
[01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:09.511]  What I should have said is that I took an oath.
[01:04:09.551 --> 01:04:10.752]  I took that oath seriously.
[01:04:10.772 --> 01:04:18.918]  And I believe that taking that oath means that I need to respect and do respect my service to the President.
[01:04:20.271 --> 01:04:26.217]  No, the oath says that you take an oath to uphold and protect the Constitution of the United States.
[01:04:26.777 --> 01:04:30.041]  That is your paramount duty.
[01:04:30.461 --> 01:04:33.684]  I know the President refers to the government as being his government.
[01:04:34.084 --> 01:04:34.605]  It's not.
[01:04:35.025 --> 01:04:37.968]  It's the government of the people of America.
[01:04:38.589 --> 01:04:41.552]  Your oath is not to uphold the President.
[01:04:42.733 --> 01:04:45.356]  Nor is mine to uphold the Senate.
[01:04:45.917 --> 01:04:49.381]  My oath, like your oath, is to uphold the Constitution.
[01:04:49.401 --> 01:04:50.702]  We'll be right back, stay with us!

[01:05:51.368 --> 01:05:53.050]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:56.793]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:05:56.994 --> 01:05:58.876]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:02.199]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:06:02.519 --> 01:06:08.045]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:06:08.305 --> 01:06:12.229]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:17.514]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:06:48.075 --> 01:06:49.515]  Bring down the New World Order.
[01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:51.276]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:51.676 --> 01:06:57.337]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:06:57.517 --> 01:07:02.598]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:07:02.938 --> 01:07:08.023]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:07:08.323 --> 01:07:13.908]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:07:14.229 --> 01:07:20.234]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:07:20.475 --> 01:07:23.978]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:07:24.238 --> 01:07:28.782]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:07:29.062 --> 01:07:29.842]  Do your part.
[01:07:30.103 --> 01:07:32.384]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:41.591]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:49.797]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[01:07:52.153 --> 01:07:54.315]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:54.915 --> 01:08:00.359]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:03.862 --> 01:08:07.805]  Dave Duchesne is our guest for the next 25 minutes.
[01:08:10.027 --> 01:08:17.593]  I was aware of his work, but I heard him on Pastor Butch Paw Show, 8 o'clock central last night, driving along down the highway, here in Austin, back to work.
[01:08:18.714 --> 01:08:20.335]  And he's just done amazing research.
[01:08:21.528 --> 01:08:22.949]  Now, really, none of this is true.
[01:08:22.969 --> 01:08:24.890]  I mean, none of this is new.
[01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:29.513]  They're just now beginning to be truthful about it.
[01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.535]  They're just now beginning to come out with it.
[01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:33.756]  In the past, they were deceptive.
[01:08:34.497 --> 01:08:47.926]  If you take my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, we have the Washington Post in there and other news articles where it said, Mexico to Canadian troops will be used during emergencies in the U.S.
[01:08:48.897 --> 01:08:52.279]  Then NORTHCOM, when it was officially established, signed deals with them.
[01:08:52.699 --> 01:08:54.900]  They've used Mexican and Canadian troops, put out fires.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.401]  Mexican troops in New Orleans.
[01:08:58.141 --> 01:08:59.462]  That's all now been on the record.
[01:08:59.802 --> 01:09:01.083]  Norwegian AWACS.
[01:09:02.303 --> 01:09:03.704]  They were very quiet about it.
[01:09:04.164 --> 01:09:05.205]  They wouldn't talk about it.
[01:09:05.245 --> 01:09:07.966]  And now they're beginning to be more out in the open with it.
[01:09:12.512 --> 01:09:20.098]  And, I mean, you see reports about Texas State Police sent to teach the Royal Mounted Police how to run checkpoints and violate people.
[01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.679]  I mean, that was in the news last year.
[01:09:22.539 --> 01:09:23.460]  It's all being merged.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:28.944]  You see Blackwater and other security at the airports up there searching Canadians coming in.
[01:09:30.905 --> 01:09:36.890]  We had, in the last month, the CFR and several other big think tanks
[01:09:38.044 --> 01:09:47.727]  Come out and call for a North American Union, first merging the border regions in the Great Lakes, just like the border regions of Mexico have already been merged under Agenda 21.
[01:09:50.128 --> 01:09:51.609]  And I quote, 100-mile buffer zone.
[01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:55.090]  So it's all happening.
[01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:58.791]  We're going into the North American Union, just like Governor Ridge, former Homeland Security head, we played
[01:09:59.551 --> 01:10:07.574]  A tape where he admitted that they want a national ID card, but he said it's not really that, it's a national driver's license, but it is a national ID card.
[01:10:07.914 --> 01:10:10.716]  So they say, well we want to integrate the countries, but we don't want to merge them.
[01:10:11.276 --> 01:10:12.296]  Integrate is merge.
[01:10:12.897 --> 01:10:21.260]  When you take a deck of cards and stack them and then put them back together again, that's integrating them.
[01:10:25.009 --> 01:10:27.670]  When you mix the cards up, you're integrating them.
[01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.011]  It's the same thing as merging them.
[01:10:29.611 --> 01:10:33.093]  You take two stacks and fan them together.
[01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:34.073]  What's that called?
[01:10:34.834 --> 01:10:43.198]  Sometimes the simplest things, I can't... You know, you take the cards, you go... put them back together, mix the cards up, shuffle them.
[01:10:43.798 --> 01:10:44.498]  Thank you, John.
[01:10:45.319 --> 01:10:47.220]  John, the little bird that pops in and helps me.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.561]  Shuffle the cards.
[01:10:51.275 --> 01:10:54.996]  But he decided to actually go interview one of the generals involved in this merger.
[01:10:55.756 --> 01:11:14.719]  He decided, and in fact he helped ferret it out and really get the mainstream media to report on it, and he decided to really talk to the local governments who had no idea, the governors, the governors aren't included in this, and he is the publisher and also the editor of the Fort Fairfield Journal.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.820]  Got a link to that up on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:22.193 --> 01:11:26.976]  And I appreciate, Dave, is it DeShane, or how do I pronounce your name?
[01:11:27.537 --> 01:11:28.397]  DeShane is correct.
[01:11:29.158 --> 01:11:32.880]  Okay, well thank you for coming on the show with us, sir.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.122]  I heard you last night, you were really informative.
[01:11:35.602 --> 01:11:37.343]  You've got the floor for the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:11:37.383 --> 01:11:41.306]  Just as simply as you can, tell us the basics of what's happened.
[01:11:41.326 --> 01:11:48.831]  How would you, with your little publication, help push this out further into the open, and then your meeting with the General, and what we're actually facing?
[01:11:49.722 --> 01:12:12.039]  Okay, Alex, a couple of weeks ago I ran a story, as WorldNetDaily did and a few other independents online, about the civil assistance plan signed by the generals of USNorthCom slash NORAD and CanadaCom in Fort Sam Houston, Texas, down your way.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:19.345]  And I thought, okay, I'll run the story, and I ran it as a North American Union military story.
[01:12:20.066 --> 01:12:28.908]  And then I thought to myself, wouldn't it be interesting to find out what our local emergency management director has to say about it at the county level?
[01:12:28.948 --> 01:12:31.308]  And I said, well, I'm questioning him.
[01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.308]  Maybe I'll write a letter to the county sheriff.
[01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:41.550]  So I got letters together for our Aroostook Emergency Management, which is our county management agency.
[01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:42.550]  We're in Aroostook County.
[01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:47.371]  And I mailed one off to our county sheriff and then one to our secretary of state.
[01:12:49.702 --> 01:12:56.007]  Next thing you know, the letters started going up the chain of command, and they wound up all the way to our state capitol in Augusta.
[01:12:56.708 --> 01:13:11.180]  And I was then putting in contact with Robert McAleer, our state emergency management director, who had no idea that this civil assistance plan was signed three weeks previous at the time.
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.323]  This was about the first of March when I started querying them.
[01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:21.095]  Next thing you know, I'm getting a call from our State Adjutant General, a General Bill Libby.
[01:13:21.115 --> 01:13:23.057]  He's a Major General, so that's two stars.
[01:13:23.797 --> 01:13:25.879]  And he's in charge of our State National Guard.
[01:13:25.939 --> 01:13:38.088]  He had no idea that this had occurred, and it took about a week for them to finally get a copy of the agreement from NORTHCOM, so that they could even review it to comment on it.
[01:13:38.348 --> 01:13:43.432]  Because I had a series of questions that I was really interested in having answered, and
[01:13:44.073 --> 01:13:50.976]  What I got from them was, we really want to answer your questions, but we have no idea what the Civil Assistance Plan is, because we never heard of it.
[01:13:51.616 --> 01:14:07.902]  Well, they finally did get a copy of it, and I did get a chance to meet with General Libby, and I think he was very honest and sincere and forthright in trying to answer my questions, but he didn't answer them.
[01:14:08.602 --> 01:14:11.563]  And he didn't answer them simply because the Civil Assistance Plan
[01:14:11.957 --> 01:14:15.320]  I wasn't addressing some of the things that I had concerns about.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:24.727]  One of the concerns was, will the Canadian troops be required to swear oath of allegiance to the United States or the U.S.
[01:14:24.767 --> 01:14:27.749]  Constitution in the event that they are used in this country?
[01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:33.794]  Well, I want to go through all that, but I want to go back here and make it clear in your articles very scholarly.
[01:14:34.735 --> 01:14:35.756]  There's actually two of them.
[01:14:36.396 --> 01:14:37.117]  They're excellent.
[01:14:37.777 --> 01:14:41.200]  And covering the law, covering the agreement, that's been very secretive.
[01:14:42.165 --> 01:14:46.728]  The governors, the Congress of the United States, they have not been included in this.
[01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:56.815]  And this is part of the Continuity of Government Plan under PDD 51 that Bush has told the Homeland Security Committee of the House and Senate they can't see.
[01:14:57.436 --> 01:15:01.238]  Now, again, the Speaker of the House is at the same level of the President.
[01:15:01.759 --> 01:15:03.320]  The leader of the Senate is at the same level.
[01:15:04.501 --> 01:15:09.124]  When you come to power in the three branches of government, they are equal.
[01:15:09.184 --> 01:15:10.625]  It's co-equal is the term.
[01:15:11.686 --> 01:15:23.795]  Bush is saying no, and even in the declassified short version of PDD 51, the accompanying executive order, Bush says, Congress, you don't run anything anymore.
[01:15:23.875 --> 01:15:27.518]  This is a declaration of Führer-like powers.
[01:15:28.018 --> 01:15:36.644]  And I played the former White House political director, Sarah Taylor, earlier, saying she swears an oath to Bush, not to America.
[01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:39.226]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:15:40.191 --> 01:16:03.919]  Yeah, and I think I got that from the interview, and I think General Libby was in a roundabout way figuring that out, too, because he said, well, don't worry, the state governor and the Adjutant Generals of the various states, they're the ones who have to request the use of foreign troops through NORTHCOM.
[01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:04.699]  That's not true!
[01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:05.679]  That's not true!
[01:16:06.519 --> 01:16:07.940]  That's correct, and I showed him
[01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:13.445]  I showed him section 1068 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.
[01:16:13.465 --> 01:16:29.049]  I had a copy of it right in front of me, and we read it word for word, and it says, the President shall use, and the words are, the militia, armed forces, or both, or by any other means, and shall take such measures as he considers necessary.
[01:16:29.069 --> 01:16:30.989]  And I said, General Libby, that says President.
[01:16:31.935 --> 01:16:33.376]  As he considers necessary.
[01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:34.436]  That doesn't say Governor.
[01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:35.997]  That doesn't say Adjutant General.
[01:16:36.037 --> 01:16:39.918]  That doesn't say any of those emergency management agencies.
[01:16:40.098 --> 01:16:40.959]  It says President.
[01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:46.341]  And he essentially said, well, that's a little above my pay grade to answer those questions.
[01:16:49.802 --> 01:16:53.804]  Put it in a nutshell and then go through your meeting and the other excellent points you make.
[01:16:53.864 --> 01:16:56.025]  I mean, this is so off the chart this is happening.
[01:16:56.725 --> 01:16:57.785]  And it is happening.
[01:16:58.626 --> 01:17:01.287]  And the governors and the federal
[01:17:02.023 --> 01:17:06.627]  Congress isn't even allowed to be involved and has no authority.
[01:17:07.027 --> 01:17:08.348]  But Bush can't just say that.
[01:17:08.428 --> 01:17:10.230]  Well, it's like Hitler couldn't say he was Fuhrer.
[01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.930]  He did.
[01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.991]  People followed the order.
[01:17:12.291 --> 01:17:13.112]  And you know what happened.
[01:17:13.152 --> 01:17:15.814]  We have... And again, folks, I know a lot of you love Bush.
[01:17:16.414 --> 01:17:17.015]  That's fine.
[01:17:17.735 --> 01:17:18.416]  You love the narrative.
[01:17:18.456 --> 01:17:20.097]  Well, he's a total puppet, runs nothing.
[01:17:20.337 --> 01:17:23.440]  Well, your God, Hillary, or your God, Obama, is going to have these powers.
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:23.780]  Go ahead.
[01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:24.701]  Right.
[01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:31.086]  And just as he got done saying, well, don't worry, it's just going to be the governors and attorneys generals inviting them in, I said, well,
[01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:38.168]  I made the point that you just admitted, General, that you weren't included in the discussions on this plan.
[01:17:38.188 --> 01:17:52.141]  So you weren't included on the discussions, you weren't advised that it even occurred, and you expect them to let you invite in the Canadian troops on a plan that they went around your back on.
[01:17:53.042 --> 01:17:55.345]  And there was pretty much silence in the room then.
[01:17:56.266 --> 01:18:10.110]  We, of course, had to move on, but I wanted to know things like, will the Canadians, or, and I said essentially it's foreign military, so I referred a lot to the foreign military, will they be allowed to carry arms in our country?
[01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:15.571]  Because he had said, General Levy had said, well, don't worry, they're not going to be here for law enforcement.
[01:18:15.711 --> 01:18:23.213]  Just right after I showed him Section 1068 of the NDAA, I said, okay, if they're not going to be here for law enforcement, are they going to be armed?
[01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:28.206]  And he says the Civil Assistance Plan is silent on that question.
[01:18:29.646 --> 01:18:30.867]  I said, okay, that's interesting.
[01:18:31.047 --> 01:18:32.127]  It is not silent.
[01:18:32.187 --> 01:18:43.130]  It is not silent because in earlier agreements between NORTHCOM and in mainstream news reports and NORTHCOM press releases, they've said for civil emergencies and to deal with terrorists
[01:18:43.903 --> 01:18:51.145]  And they have trained, and I've been to Urban Warfare Drills, where they train with foreign troops for operations in the US.
[01:18:51.185 --> 01:18:51.485]  Go ahead.
[01:18:51.985 --> 01:18:52.245]  Okay.
[01:18:52.805 --> 01:19:01.948]  And I said, furthermore, I'd like to know who these foreign troops are, who's going to be their command structure, if and when they are deployed in the state.
[01:19:02.583 --> 01:19:11.425]  And I was speaking specifically from a state of Maine level, because I'm talking to the Maine Adjutant General, and I said, if Canadian troops are in our state, I would like to know who's in charge of them.
[01:19:11.505 --> 01:19:12.525]  Is it going to be the Sheriff?
[01:19:12.545 --> 01:19:13.386]  Is it going to be the Governor?
[01:19:13.426 --> 01:19:14.006]  Is it going to be you?
[01:19:14.506 --> 01:19:23.748]  And he said, well, there's an understanding that they would be reporting to the state's Adjutant Generals when assisting in pre-known events, such as security at sports events.
[01:19:24.224 --> 01:19:24.624]  It is a big idea
[01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:55.108]  A New World Order.
[01:19:55.809 --> 01:19:59.850]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:03.511]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:03.551 --> 01:20:05.732]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:20:06.332 --> 01:20:08.753]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:16.836]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:19.864 --> 01:20:24.827]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:25.308 --> 01:20:28.750]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:31.652]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:31.752 --> 01:20:32.893]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:33.673]  They're not after money.
[01:20:33.693 --> 01:20:34.774]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:34.974 --> 01:20:35.675]  They're after power.
[01:20:35.955 --> 01:20:36.775]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:20:48.623 --> 01:20:49.664]  You have been warned.
[01:20:50.544 --> 01:20:52.005]  America needs Ron Paul.
[01:20:52.225 --> 01:20:53.285]  He needs your support.
[01:20:53.505 --> 01:20:54.525]  The time is now.
[01:20:54.886 --> 01:20:58.787]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[01:20:59.107 --> 01:21:03.188]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.

[01:21:57.233 --> 01:21:58.814]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:58.814 --> 01:21:59.474]  We're good to go.
[01:22:28.223 --> 01:22:28.523]  I think so.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:54.643]  The national savings rate has plummeted to an all-time low, while household debt is at an all-time high.
[01:22:54.783 --> 01:22:56.805]  The answer is not the creation of more debt.
[01:22:57.005 --> 01:23:10.336]  Using the innovative Interest-Canceling Money Merge Account program, along with existing banking tools, we offer you the power to pay off your mortgage in a fraction of the time and potentially save thousands in interest, all without refinancing an existing mortgage or interrupting your lifestyle.

[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:21.122]  It is estimated that in just 18 months, our team alone has helped American homeowners get on track to save a half a billion dollars in interest.

[01:24:21.619 --> 01:24:38.967]  Okay, the main concern that I had was if we have a shortage of manpower and we need extra troops and our National Guard is called away or there isn't enough of them, I asked General Libby to comment on our main State Guard, because as you've mentioned in the past on your show,
[01:24:39.471 --> 01:24:46.213]  That various states do have their own state guard, which is a separate, standalone entity from the National Guard.
[01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:56.156]  And in Maine, our state guard is codified at Maine Revised Statutes, Title 37B, Sections 221 to 225, I believe it is.
[01:24:56.856 --> 01:25:02.478]  And it essentially says that the Maine State Guard is empowered by the governor.
[01:25:02.858 --> 01:25:06.379]  It is made up of the militia, and it does use the word militia, ages 18 to 45 years of age.
[01:25:08.764 --> 01:25:15.466]  And it is to be equipped, it is to be uniformed and share the same military rank as the Army, the U.S.
[01:25:15.526 --> 01:25:19.107]  Army, but it is not to be used in federal service.
[01:25:19.167 --> 01:25:21.727]  It is not to be used outside of the borders of the state.
[01:25:22.407 --> 01:25:30.910]  And it was originally formed during World War II when our National Guard was sent overseas, activated, sent overseas.
[01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:36.831]  We wanted a guard unit still in the state, so we formed the Maine State Guard.
[01:25:37.575 --> 01:25:38.415]  And we equipped them.
[01:25:38.455 --> 01:25:45.057]  And I asked General Libya, I said, look, we don't need to go to Canada or England or Germany or anywhere else for troops, for assistance.
[01:25:45.117 --> 01:25:52.779]  We've got enough people right here in the state now that can pass out blankets and bottled water and do whatever else needs to be done.
[01:25:52.859 --> 01:25:56.940]  We can do it through an organization that already exists in the Maine State Guard.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:03.081]  We don't have to pass any new laws and we don't have to make any new plans or protocols.
[01:26:03.141 --> 01:26:05.662]  And he said the State Guard currently has nobody in it.
[01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:07.722]  And that it exists solely on paper.
[01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:10.224]  And that's as far as he would go with that.
[01:26:10.244 --> 01:26:12.987]  Because, of course, he can't activate the State Guard.
[01:26:13.007 --> 01:26:14.108]  That would have to be the Governor.
[01:26:14.448 --> 01:26:16.009]  Well, there's bad and worse here.
[01:26:16.329 --> 01:26:22.735]  And, number one, Bush has federalized the National Guard, said he's above the Governors and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:27.198]  All of it fits seamlessly into his PDD 51 saying he's a dictator.
[01:26:27.459 --> 01:26:28.840]  Or the Office of the Presidency is.
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:33.904]  We don't want to make this about his personality because it's going to go way past that particular puppet.
[01:26:34.384 --> 01:26:35.526]  That meat puppet they've got.
[01:26:35.926 --> 01:26:50.085]  So issue one is that he's acting as a dictator, saying he runs and owns and they all, they even have a new, they've added on, they still have the old oath, but they've added on one to him now, in the military.
[01:26:51.026 --> 01:26:54.988]  And his chiefs of staff and people literally say they worship him, they follow him.
[01:26:55.349 --> 01:26:58.591]  His White House memos say that law comes from him.
[01:26:58.691 --> 01:26:59.911]  He cannot break the law.
[01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:01.932]  He can torture children with pliers.
[01:27:03.113 --> 01:27:03.874]  He can order that.
[01:27:03.914 --> 01:27:06.515]  That's actually in memos to the Defense Department listeners.
[01:27:06.855 --> 01:27:07.796]  That's mainstream news.
[01:27:07.816 --> 01:27:09.016]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:11.470]  But they know what they're doing.
[01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:12.691]  They're setting that precedent.
[01:27:13.031 --> 01:27:14.011]  But that's bad enough.
[01:27:14.231 --> 01:27:19.893]  Now it's the old bring in the mercenaries that have been brought into our shores three separate times.
[01:27:19.953 --> 01:27:21.394]  The Hessians, the Germans, others.
[01:27:22.574 --> 01:27:28.736]  1776, 1812, the Mexicans brought in mercenaries from Ireland and other places.
[01:27:29.597 --> 01:27:33.238]  This has happened before and we're dealing with this now.
[01:27:33.338 --> 01:27:36.719]  So just the ultimate insult to injury, the rubbing it in,
[01:27:42.677 --> 01:27:43.297]  Your comments.
[01:27:44.138 --> 01:27:46.479]  Yeah, that's correct, Alex.
[01:27:46.879 --> 01:27:53.482]  And what I think the solution would be would be to activate a Maine State Guard in the event it were needed.
[01:27:53.542 --> 01:28:00.885]  But it doesn't seem at the state level that that is even really a discussion that they're interested in having.
[01:28:01.165 --> 01:28:11.009]  They have roped them in as well, as I show in Martial Law, the film, to be minions being directed by the Federal Guard.
[01:28:11.872 --> 01:28:12.612]  In most cases.
[01:28:13.212 --> 01:28:13.392]  Yep.
[01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:20.214]  And I think they were a little put off by the fact that they weren't even included in this discussion.
[01:28:20.274 --> 01:28:33.117]  He said he would have at least liked to have been forewarned that they had this civilizations plan going, so that when somebody like me from the press comes to him, he'd have some intelligent answers to give.
[01:28:33.857 --> 01:28:39.799]  And he gave me some answers, and I don't think he was lying to me, because he did call me.
[01:28:39.919 --> 01:28:40.739]  I didn't call him.
[01:28:41.585 --> 01:28:43.226]  Uh, and he suggested we meet.
[01:28:43.726 --> 01:28:56.314]  So, he reached out to me, and I respect him for that, but it was almost like his hands were tied as to what he could reveal or what he couldn't reveal.
[01:28:56.674 --> 01:29:03.418]  Now, on record, you met with this two-star Brigadier General, or Major General, in charge of what area?
[01:29:04.219 --> 01:29:06.480]  He is the Adjutant General.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.161]  So, he's the top general.
[01:29:08.221 --> 01:29:09.882]  He's in charge of the Maine National Guard.
[01:29:09.922 --> 01:29:11.043]  He's also the Governor's
[01:29:11.856 --> 01:29:15.459]  Stay there.
[01:29:15.519 --> 01:29:20.262]  I want to do two or three minutes on the other side.
[01:29:20.803 --> 01:29:30.950]  Because you pointed out to him, PDD 51, you pointed out that... And I want to specifically get what his response was, even his body language to that.
[01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:32.472]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:32.512 --> 01:29:34.273]  We've got more breaking news as well.
[01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:37.435]  Two big guests coming up in the next hour.

[01:33:05.018 --> 01:33:06.938]  Into this house we're born.
[01:33:08.376 --> 01:33:12.117]  We're going to go back to the Fort Fairfield Journal publisher and editor.

[01:33:34.190 --> 01:33:37.291]  And I can't find a note that took me hours to write up.
[01:33:37.371 --> 01:33:37.852]  Questions?
[01:33:38.472 --> 01:33:39.692]  Classic Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.732 --> 01:33:41.453]  Do all the preparation and then lose the piece of paper.
[01:33:43.694 --> 01:33:54.238]  Before we go back to our guests and finish up with a question or two and then go to another very important guest with very important information, I want to encourage everybody to check out the fine folks at Interfood.
[01:33:56.579 --> 01:33:57.980]  Their website, of course, is
[01:33:59.565 --> 01:33:59.885]  I think so.
[01:34:19.103 --> 01:34:22.126]  At Interfood.com on the Alex Jones section or 1-866-762-9238.
[01:34:22.146 --> 01:34:22.206]  1-866-762-9238.
[01:34:22.226 --> 01:34:25.648]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you when you call to get those discounts.
[01:34:25.668 --> 01:34:26.609]  1-866-762-9238 or Interfood.com.
[01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:30.032]  And another fine sponsor that we have are the folks at New Vitality.
[01:34:44.491 --> 01:34:47.332]  One of the most respected names and supplements and vitamins out there.
[01:34:47.372 --> 01:34:51.373]  Now, again, I don't sell magic machines that magically heal you.
[01:34:52.114 --> 01:34:53.254]  I don't believe in that and I hate it.
[01:34:53.774 --> 01:34:58.556]  I don't sell vitamins and say this will cure everything and you'll live forever and it fixes a million things.
[01:34:59.216 --> 01:35:04.718]  These are just things that are well-known, well-documented, old-line things that are known to be good for you.
[01:35:05.138 --> 01:35:05.318]  Okay?
[01:35:05.418 --> 01:35:05.878]  Good for you.
[01:35:05.898 --> 01:35:07.919]  I want to make that clear.
[01:35:08.559 --> 01:35:10.380]  Like aloes, colon, and body cleanse.
[01:35:11.967 --> 01:35:19.066]  Aloe vera is one of the best known things for flushing your guts out and that's where most of the toxins are and that's why some people get different types of cancer in their stomach.
[01:35:20.125 --> 01:35:21.366]  In their colon.
[01:35:21.386 --> 01:35:22.307]  I mean, you know.
[01:35:22.327 --> 01:35:24.568]  I'm sure you've got family that have died of it.
[01:35:24.888 --> 01:35:26.029]  It's just very good for you.
[01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:33.113]  It's got a mixture of things, not just aloe vera, that are really known to be good for your entire intestinal GI tract.
[01:35:33.133 --> 01:35:34.614]  1-800-569-4056, 1-800-569-4056, aloes, colon, and body cleanse.
[01:35:34.634 --> 01:35:36.155]  And then also very well known herbs.
[01:35:36.175 --> 01:35:37.556]  I have the documentation for that.
[01:35:45.638 --> 01:35:47.440]  Just go out and research these herbs for yourself.
[01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:55.090]  They're known for having great prostate health, shrinking the prostate for people who have had problems with that or to keep from having problems with that.
[01:35:55.868 --> 01:35:59.171]  A lot of other nutritive effects with these supplements, but that's the main one.
[01:35:59.692 --> 01:36:01.273]  Super Beta Prostate 1-800-569-4056.
[01:36:01.293 --> 01:36:19.231]  Okay, going back to the Fort Fairfield Journal writer and editor who put the story out, North American Union military forges new Canadian alliance, Canadian military to assist in civilian law enforcement duties in the United States.
[01:36:19.531 --> 01:36:20.392]  He went and met with
[01:36:21.087 --> 01:36:25.088]  One of the top generals over all this who wasn't even aware of what was happening.
[01:36:25.128 --> 01:36:39.550]  In closing, what happened when you brought up the fact that under the executive orders under PDD 51 that the states didn't have any authority and that the president claimed all authority and that Congress didn't have authority?
[01:36:40.011 --> 01:36:42.531]  Well, I addressed that question with him this way.
[01:36:42.611 --> 01:36:47.432]  I explained to him the NDAA and I showed him how it says
[01:36:49.057 --> 01:36:55.179]  It uses the words insurrection, and it says if that opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States.
[01:36:55.599 --> 01:37:01.080]  And I said, General Libby, there's a law in the United States called Real ID that Maine has said they're not going to follow.
[01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:12.923]  And I told him, I said, I'm not sitting here making pretend that the president is going to, or even implying the president's going to come into the state with his troops or Canadian troops and force us to take Real ID.
[01:37:13.683 --> 01:37:19.708]  But I said, you know, we live in a very strange and fluid and unpredictable world where events happen.
[01:37:20.488 --> 01:37:29.975]  And an event may happen in this state which the feds can then capitalize on and use that as a precursor and as an excuse to bring their troops in.
[01:37:30.055 --> 01:37:42.545]  So, supposing something were to happen and we bring the troops in, we've got some foreign troops in here now, and they decide they're going to start exercising law enforcement, they're going to take over our police legislature or even our governor's office,
[01:37:43.684 --> 01:37:54.871]  What measures are in place to prevent that from happening, given the fact that if we brought in these foreign troops, we admittedly don't have enough people in state to handle it now.
[01:37:55.212 --> 01:37:57.433]  He simply said the plan doesn't address that question.
[01:37:59.254 --> 01:38:00.535]  I've only got about a minute left.
[01:38:00.555 --> 01:38:02.476]  We really appreciate you coming on and joining us.
[01:38:02.536 --> 01:38:05.818]  Everybody should go to your fine publication and read it, the photos, the documents.
[01:38:05.878 --> 01:38:07.779]  It's really first-class journalism.
[01:38:08.980 --> 01:38:11.902]  Mr. Duchenne, in 60 seconds, any other key points?
[01:38:14.679 --> 01:38:18.182]  My biggest key point, and the one that I'm going to keep harping on, is the State Guard.
[01:38:18.342 --> 01:38:26.809]  If we're going to have emergencies that we need extra hands on, we need to get educated on our own State Guard units.
[01:38:26.869 --> 01:38:28.211]  I've researched the other states.
[01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:29.151]  New York has one.
[01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:30.532]  I believe New Hampshire has one.
[01:38:30.552 --> 01:38:30.973]  Vermont.
[01:38:31.533 --> 01:38:40.741]  There are some states that don't have them in their statute yet, but there are certainly enough of them that people can put some pressure on their legislators and their governors to
[01:38:41.334 --> 01:38:45.898]  Consider seriously the use of their own state's guards as opposed to national guards.
[01:38:46.639 --> 01:38:49.501]  And prevent foreign troops from being used in their state.
[01:38:49.881 --> 01:38:50.322]  I agree.
[01:38:50.702 --> 01:38:52.283]  I look forward to talking to you again in the future.
[01:38:52.343 --> 01:38:53.144]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:38:54.785 --> 01:38:55.266]  Take care.
[01:38:55.506 --> 01:38:58.128]  There goes the head of the Fort Fairfield Journal.
[01:38:58.829 --> 01:39:00.490]  I really appreciate you, Dave Duchesne.
[01:39:08.546 --> 01:39:16.712]  The bottom line here is that if they take the pension funds, if they totally implode the dollar, there will be insanity in the streets.
[01:39:16.732 --> 01:39:19.333]  They're doing it by design, and they are geared up and trained.
[01:39:19.353 --> 01:39:21.515]  And I don't believe a two-star general doesn't know this.
[01:39:22.115 --> 01:39:25.998]  Low-level people even know they're preparing for urban warfare takeovers of the U.S.
[01:39:26.378 --> 01:39:27.699]  That's been going on for decades.
[01:39:28.539 --> 01:39:32.842]  So he's playing stupid with Dave Duchenne, but it's out there.
[01:39:33.042 --> 01:39:35.544]  Agreements to bring in foreign troops, the governors have no say.
[01:39:35.684 --> 01:39:36.925]  That's the big news here.
[01:39:37.779 --> 01:39:40.281]  And that dovetails into all the other things we're dealing with.
[01:39:40.321 --> 01:39:41.603]  He joins us about once a month.
[01:39:42.303 --> 01:39:43.945]  And I heard him on Derry Brownfield a few days ago.
[01:39:43.965 --> 01:39:45.186]  Just excellent information.
[01:39:45.286 --> 01:39:46.167]  So well researched.
[01:39:46.727 --> 01:39:48.449]  We're really blessed to have somebody like...
[01:39:49.338 --> 01:39:50.139]  Hey, glad to be aboard, Alex.
[01:40:14.252 --> 01:40:19.356]  You know, it's kind of interesting, these things that you're talking about with troops and everything.
[01:40:20.077 --> 01:40:22.939]  We had an interesting news break just recently.
[01:40:23.799 --> 01:40:26.782]  There are two ways that countries can use their military.
[01:40:27.943 --> 01:40:38.711]  And most people think when it comes down to food and those issues, that what's going to happen, and what has happened in so many countries where they've had starvation and riots,
[01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:46.236]  Is that the military goes in and cordons off the storage area for food and protects the food from the people.
[01:40:47.356 --> 01:40:49.137]  Egypt has an interesting situation.
[01:40:49.977 --> 01:40:58.819]  Their military, in order to forego the riots and things that they'd have to handle, they're putting their army to work baking bread.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:00.200]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:02.080]  That makes sense.
[01:41:03.081 --> 01:41:03.941]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:41:05.284 --> 01:41:12.710]  I've been doing some calculating, and I've been watching what's going on, and just in the last week, Alex, we've had some very interesting things break.
[01:41:13.730 --> 01:41:23.337]  In Taiwan, the farmers are guarding their fields 24 hours a day because of the shortage of rice and the theft of rice right straight out of the fields.
[01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:34.525]  In Egypt, they're having potential riots, and the army has been put to work baking bread to avoid the riots.
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:36.261]  Steve, I gotta stop you.
[01:41:36.321 --> 01:41:38.162]  You said this on my show like a year ago.
[01:41:38.222 --> 01:41:39.583]  How did you know all this was gonna happen?
[01:41:42.025 --> 01:41:42.625]  I don't know.
[01:41:43.406 --> 01:41:46.708]  I've been sitting at the supply end of the food chain for a long time.
[01:41:47.148 --> 01:41:52.092]  We've watched other countries that have had this experience.
[01:41:52.132 --> 01:41:53.293]  We've watched the history.
[01:41:54.153 --> 01:41:54.694]  We've looked.
[01:41:55.365 --> 01:42:05.948]  Basically, we got a lot of Christians out there, and they've been reading the book of Revelations, and we've got the template for this whole thing, including the New World Order's attack on food, right there in the story of Joseph.
[01:42:06.928 --> 01:42:14.790]  The fascinating thing is that what most people don't read about that is, you know, the famine was supposed to be seven years.
[01:42:15.710 --> 01:42:22.212]  Well, and it was seven years, but in the first year, the people gave up of the famine, the people gave up their money.
[01:42:22.842 --> 01:42:24.864]  In the second year they gave up their cattle.
[01:42:25.365 --> 01:42:32.612]  In the third year they came and they said, we have nothing left except our land and ourselves.
[01:42:33.092 --> 01:42:41.720]  And in the 47th verse it says, I have bought you this day and your land for the Pharaoh.
[01:42:43.823 --> 01:42:51.570]  Believe me, the Christians can read the book of Revelations, but the other side has read it, and they've followed the pattern, and that's where it is.
[01:42:52.111 --> 01:42:55.834]  Now we've got... I figure it this way, Alex.
[01:42:56.715 --> 01:42:59.237]  January of 2008 was the last month
[01:43:02.344 --> 01:43:22.030]  That the people in this nation had to decide and to choose whether they believed all of the sky is falling information that you and I and many of the other pundits in the subject have given out, whether they believed it and whether they were going to act it or not.
[01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:29.312]  Because as of February, the riots all over the world for food have started.
[01:43:30.072 --> 01:43:31.753]  We are in the third year
[01:43:32.652 --> 01:43:43.854]  of this famine and if you'll notice back in Joseph's time they didn't have to go all seven years before the people were in bondage as a result of their need to have food
[01:43:45.222 --> 01:43:51.847]  The fact is that we're in the third year, and the rioting in various countries has started over food.
[01:43:52.307 --> 01:44:14.564]  Now, five years ago, there was a statement made by one of the executives in Homeland Security, and this was kind of off the record, a quiet statement that said, we need 400,000 to a million well-trained urban control troops to deal with food rioting.
[01:44:15.615 --> 01:44:18.637]  Now let me tell you what's happening right now.
[01:44:19.097 --> 01:44:20.558]  It's not something for the future.
[01:44:20.578 --> 01:44:25.782]  You see, back in January of this year, Alex, people had still a choice.
[01:44:26.242 --> 01:44:40.312]  The vast majority that were kind of snickering and laughing at those of us that were nuts and their friends and neighbors, the few that were putting in food supplies, and they had the choice at that time.
[01:44:40.822 --> 01:44:45.623]  To kind of believe it or not believe it and say, well, yeah, it's in the future.
[01:44:46.123 --> 01:44:48.384]  Well, there is nothing in the future.
[01:44:48.424 --> 01:44:57.726]  Just like I've heard you say that for over a year now, at least in my listening, that it's not any conspiracy theory.
[01:44:58.186 --> 01:44:59.066]  It's an agenda.
[01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:08.089]  And the fact is that with regard to the food issues, it's not something that's in the future and a theory like it was back in 1999.
[01:45:09.634 --> 01:45:11.855]  We have rioting in various nations.
[01:45:12.336 --> 01:45:14.377]  We have the bees disappearing.
[01:45:14.877 --> 01:45:21.521]  We are sitting in the breadbasket of the world, or what used to be the breadbasket of the world.
[01:45:21.942 --> 01:45:31.107]  The nation that in 1959 could feed the entire world five times over is now importing food, contaminated food, from its enemies.
[01:45:32.188 --> 01:45:34.509]  But let's take this a little bit further.
[01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:37.291]  The rioting is the end result.
[01:45:38.157 --> 01:45:45.020]  But let's take something like food that is scarce and let's compare it to other circumstances.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:53.464]  Do you realize those farmers guarding their fields is an arch type of what we're going to be dealing with?
[01:45:53.864 --> 01:46:03.568]  Do you realize that right now, right this minute, Alex, the people that we have packing the food for us
[01:46:04.210 --> 01:46:04.590]  All right.
[01:46:22.125 --> 01:46:22.525]  I don't know.
[01:46:43.928 --> 01:46:45.271]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:46:45.892 --> 01:46:47.296]  Well, Steve, I want to stop right there.
[01:46:48.238 --> 01:46:51.304]  We do have, on average, food prices up about 30%.
[01:46:52.286 --> 01:46:54.191]  We do have many grains more than doubling.
[01:46:55.106 --> 01:46:59.911]  And we do have serious, you know, talk of recession, depression, hyperinflation.
[01:47:00.712 --> 01:47:09.282]  To me, it's just a good insurance policy, and I've always had storable foods the last 12 years or so, to have high-quality, dried foods, because they store well, last a long time.
[01:47:09.302 --> 01:47:14.748]  And I know in third-world countries, they're having some food riots, and this is all
[01:47:15.408 --> 01:47:16.869]  Unprecedented, what's going on.
[01:47:16.889 --> 01:47:18.790]  And I sure hope you're wrong.
[01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:23.292]  I mean, I literally, a year ago, I was kind of like, well, I think it's a good insurance policy.
[01:47:23.713 --> 01:47:25.233]  But come on, Steve, food riots.
[01:47:25.253 --> 01:47:27.034]  I think we're going to see food prices go up.
[01:47:27.094 --> 01:47:31.077]  Now we're seeing the food riots, and now they're talking about shortages here.
[01:47:31.117 --> 01:47:34.058]  I don't know if it'll get as bad as places like Egypt.
[01:47:34.078 --> 01:47:38.140]  But if we do have a depression, which could happen any time, it will.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:42.303]  So I just say, if there's a 10% chance of this happening, we need to be prepared.
[01:47:42.323 --> 01:47:43.043]  And unfortunately,
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:48.902]  There's a 100% chance that food prices are going to go up exponentially and the dollar is going to keep going down.
[01:47:48.922 --> 01:47:52.183]  A 30-40% chance we're going to have a depression.
[01:47:52.443 --> 01:47:53.283]  The experts are saying 100%.
[01:47:54.423 --> 01:47:54.944]  I don't know.
[01:47:54.964 --> 01:47:57.264]  I just want to be conservative.
[01:47:57.765 --> 01:48:04.327]  But when you get into the GMO food and... But number one, why all over the world is the food running out?
[01:48:04.367 --> 01:48:05.247]  Because that's admitted.
[01:48:06.351 --> 01:48:13.954]  Well, for the last two years, the last two growing seasons, the planet has not produced as much food as the people on the planet ate.
[01:48:14.735 --> 01:48:18.176]  We have a serious water issue all over the world.
[01:48:18.856 --> 01:48:22.378]  We have the control of seeds.
[01:48:22.918 --> 01:48:34.823]  Farmers used to be able to replant their seeds, and now we have the seed repository where that mother seed is being stored, and the farmers are given only seed that they can plant the next year.
[01:48:34.943 --> 01:48:35.744]  And who owns that?
[01:48:35.804 --> 01:48:38.085]  The Rothschilds, the Queen of England, the Rockefellers.
[01:48:38.365 --> 01:48:41.047]  They're in the news owning vaults all over the world.
[01:48:41.387 --> 01:48:43.308]  They're busy cornering the market on this.
[01:48:43.608 --> 01:48:49.632]  Then we have Monsanto in 99 saying they were going to contaminate everything on purpose to make us accept GMO.
[01:48:49.672 --> 01:48:50.793]  I mean, this is devilish.
[01:48:51.733 --> 01:48:56.016]  Well, that's absolutely true, but let's follow this a little bit.
[01:48:57.117 --> 01:49:02.180]  One of the things that happens in any scarce item is as soon as it starts to be scarce,
[01:49:03.067 --> 01:49:27.226]  As soon as we realize, well, I've told you before, Alex, that the warehouse that packs the food for the J. Michael Stevens Group that has shipped out the food that you've received and that a whole bunch of listeners have ordered and are presently ordering in large quantities, they were contacted by the three largest grain suppliers in the West
[01:49:28.095 --> 01:49:34.220]  Asking if they would sell back to them some grain so that they could fill their schedules.
[01:49:35.641 --> 01:49:49.151]  Flour, this coming month, is going to be rationed to bakeries and some of the independent grocery stores by some of the huge distribution organizations in the country.
[01:49:49.992 --> 01:49:52.814]  But what happens when you have something go scarce?
[01:49:55.025 --> 01:49:56.886]  First of all, the prices go up.
[01:49:57.166 --> 01:49:58.207]  We're already there.
[01:49:58.407 --> 01:50:16.157]  I mean, the poor people in this country live... One of the reasons that 60% of the population is overweight is that when people run out of money to pay their bills and buy groceries, the only place that they can cut it back is in their groceries, and so they buy cheaper and cheaper food.
[01:50:16.457 --> 01:50:21.620]  They buy spaghetti, and they buy rice, they buy
[01:50:22.648 --> 01:50:28.813]  They buy noodles, they buy hot ramen, because that will fill their bellies.
[01:50:29.154 --> 01:50:34.818]  It makes them fat, and we are the most overfed, undernourished nation in the world.
[01:50:34.898 --> 01:50:36.380]  That's right, it's just nothing but sugar.
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:37.120]  Stay there.
[01:50:38.842 --> 01:50:43.546]  You see, half of the Social Security check value has been cut in the last four years.
[01:50:44.548 --> 01:50:47.771]  Now, as food prices explode, that's why you get the food riots.
[01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:51.555]  Not of lack of food, but that the increase in price.
[01:50:51.996 --> 01:51:04.689]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:05.129 --> 01:51:15.811]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:16.191 --> 01:51:19.392]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:19.612 --> 01:51:27.113]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:45.401]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[01:51:45.762 --> 01:51:51.085]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:51:52.082 --> 01:51:52.642]  Hi, neighbor.
[01:51:52.942 --> 01:51:58.445]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[01:51:59.065 --> 01:52:04.827]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[01:52:05.568 --> 01:52:08.829]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[01:52:09.469 --> 01:52:12.691]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[01:52:13.371 --> 01:52:16.735]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[01:52:17.335 --> 01:52:21.860]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[01:52:22.581 --> 01:52:24.543]  We will still have two regrets.
[01:52:25.203 --> 01:52:28.567]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[01:52:29.227 --> 01:52:32.050]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[01:52:32.871 --> 01:52:39.717]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[01:52:39.737 --> 01:52:40.578]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:52:40.598 --> 01:52:41.519]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:52:41.539 --> 01:52:41.579]  800-409-5633.
[01:52:41.599 --> 01:52:45.963]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[01:52:45.983 --> 01:52:46.804]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:53:01.445 --> 01:53:05.869]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:53:05.889 --> 01:53:08.331]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:53:08.692 --> 01:53:10.834]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[01:53:11.114 --> 01:53:14.017]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:53:16.058 --> 01:53:18.160]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:53:18.521 --> 01:53:23.866]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:53:25.788 --> 01:53:30.331]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:53:30.371 --> 01:53:33.693]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:53:35.194 --> 01:53:40.097]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[01:53:40.157 --> 01:53:43.379]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:49.043]  If we offer free shipping anywhere in the states, go to hempusa.org.
[01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:55.294]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[01:54:19.867 --> 01:54:21.408]  By the way, we got guests coming on.
[01:54:21.428 --> 01:54:23.769]  Go ahead and get them on, John, in the next few minutes.
[01:54:24.849 --> 01:54:29.271]  Dealing with the illegal DNA databases they're taking from every newborn baby in this country.
[01:54:30.171 --> 01:54:31.852]  That is coming up.
[01:54:34.053 --> 01:54:37.614]  Steve Shane, we've only got about 3-4 minutes left here and we really appreciate you coming on.
[01:54:38.295 --> 01:54:43.497]  You've been the place I've chosen to get my storable foods in the last decade, really.
[01:54:44.202 --> 01:54:47.743]  And I've gotten them four separate times from you, and the quality's excellent.
[01:54:48.184 --> 01:54:50.064]  Lasts more than ten years in climate control.
[01:54:50.104 --> 01:54:51.625]  Ten years in not climate controlled.
[01:54:52.525 --> 01:54:55.006]  Bottom line with inflation, it's an insurance policy.
[01:54:55.466 --> 01:54:56.707]  You can and will eat.
[01:54:57.627 --> 01:55:03.329]  Even if everything turns out wonderful, which we all hope and pray for, but it doesn't look good.
[01:55:03.509 --> 01:55:04.690]  And you've got two-month supplies.
[01:55:04.710 --> 01:55:06.570]  Your supplies are very inexpensive.
[01:55:07.011 --> 01:55:08.871]  It's a fraction of what the supermarkets cost.
[01:55:09.632 --> 01:55:13.333]  Tell folks about some of the packages and finish up that important point you were making.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:19.682]  Well, the packages are based on one year, and they're all well-balanced.
[01:55:20.123 --> 01:55:25.745]  And the objective is to get as much food into family homes as possible while they can still get it.
[01:55:25.805 --> 01:55:28.306]  You see, Alex, we've got a foot race going.
[01:55:28.326 --> 01:55:33.088]  You've all heard the old thing about there's a foot race as to whether one event will occur before the other one.
[01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:38.591]  The two events are very simple, and they both have the possibility of occurring very soon.
[01:55:39.751 --> 01:55:49.273]  One is where a large percentage of the population, food prices will go so high that a large percentage of the population will not be able to afford it.
[01:55:50.053 --> 01:55:54.314]  And the other alternative is that the food will disappear and there will be nothing at any price.
[01:55:54.334 --> 01:56:00.155]  I wanted to cover just the path that scarce items follow.
[01:56:00.175 --> 01:56:05.076]  We have a dependency on food and anytime something becomes scarce, in this case food,
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:07.181]  You go through several steps.
[01:56:07.221 --> 01:56:08.502]  There are basically four of them.
[01:56:08.682 --> 01:56:13.565]  The first one is under normal times when people can buy and sell and they can get what they need.
[01:56:14.525 --> 01:56:19.828]  The next thing that happens, and this is going on with a vengeance right now, Alex.
[01:56:19.988 --> 01:56:20.949]  It's not in the future.
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:37.292]  When investors realize that the item is scarce, food is scarce, wheat is being bought up by investors right now and being held just like gold is for the time when they can resell it and make huge profits.
[01:56:38.093 --> 01:56:40.915]  Other foods are being done the same way.
[01:56:41.650 --> 01:56:51.727]  The next step after the investors is when the criminal element concludes that there is really money to be made if they go in and steal it.
[01:56:55.791 --> 01:57:00.374]  Bottom line, put in a year's supply of food, two years, three years, four years.
[01:57:00.434 --> 01:57:08.639]  What you need to do is get on the internet, if you have access, and call up and dial up efoodsdirect.com.
[01:57:09.039 --> 01:57:17.105]  We've got a lot of information, a lot of the archive lectures that we've done, and if you don't have access to the internet, call 800-409-5633.
[01:57:22.043 --> 01:57:27.208]  All of this stuff will be put up on the internet, and it is not conjecture.
[01:57:27.668 --> 01:57:28.769]  It is exactly the same.
[01:57:28.789 --> 01:57:29.330]  No, it's all there.
[01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:44.924]  eFoods, eFoodsDirect.com, big banners at the top of InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and you also have a great show from 6 to 8 o'clock every Sunday night, right after my weekend show that I do from 4 to 6, right here on the GCN Radio Network as well.
[01:57:45.604 --> 01:57:49.685]  And that's Fearless Radio and the show's excellent, so be sure and tune into it.
[01:57:50.205 --> 01:57:52.626]  That is Sundays from 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:57:52.966 --> 01:57:53.846]  Central Standard Time.
[01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:55.806]  But give that number out twice, please.
[01:57:56.587 --> 01:57:56.907]  It is 800-409-5633.
[01:57:56.927 --> 01:57:56.967]  800-409-5633.
[01:57:57.007 --> 01:57:57.927]  We appreciate you, Alex.
[01:57:57.967 --> 01:57:59.127]  Steve, thanks for coming on.
[01:57:59.227 --> 01:57:59.927]  Take care.
[01:57:59.967 --> 01:58:01.168]  There goes Steve Schenck.
[01:58:01.188 --> 01:58:02.468]  Yeah, you're crazy if you don't
[01:58:12.532 --> 01:58:17.116]  Protect yourself and hedge your bets, but I hope he's wrong about how bad stuff's getting it.
[01:58:18.076 --> 01:58:19.978]  Looks like he's probably right, but who knows?
[01:58:20.118 --> 01:58:21.659]  Hopefully things will work themselves out.
[01:58:22.199 --> 01:58:23.120]  But don't bet on that.
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:27.824]  Okay, now we've got guests coming up about the JFK assassination.
[01:58:28.184 --> 01:58:28.724]  Stay with us.
[01:58:29.345 --> 01:58:30.345]  RFK.
[01:58:33.107 --> 01:58:34.348]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:34.368 --> 01:58:37.251]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:43.551]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:43.571 --> 01:58:45.672]  A New World Order.
[01:58:46.392 --> 01:58:50.994]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:51.274 --> 01:58:54.076]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:54.116 --> 01:58:56.277]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:56.897 --> 01:58:59.338]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:59:00.078 --> 01:59:07.402]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.421 --> 01:59:15.404]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.885 --> 01:59:19.347]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.747 --> 01:59:22.229]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.309 --> 01:59:23.470]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.490 --> 01:59:24.230]  They're not after money.
[01:59:24.250 --> 01:59:25.331]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.531 --> 01:59:26.252]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.512 --> 01:59:27.632]  That's what they're after these years.
[01:59:27.673 --> 01:59:32.196]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:59:36.378 --> 01:59:38.680]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:40.261]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.408 --> 01:59:46.331]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.812 --> 01:59:49.576]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:55.848 --> 01:59:56.949]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.609 --> 01:59:58.409]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.190 --> 02:00:00.090]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:04.412]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:04.933 --> 02:00:09.035]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.758 --> 02:00:20.040]  Monday, we've got some medical doctors coming on to talk about how the federal government quietly has been taking DNA
[02:00:23.726 --> 02:00:27.770]  From all children at birth for at least 35 years, that's now getting a lot of attention.
[02:00:28.330 --> 02:00:30.432]  Now they're putting it in the Homeland Security criminal database.
[02:00:31.232 --> 02:00:32.494]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:00:33.074 --> 02:00:38.799]  Our next guests are so prestigious that if I tried to go over all of their letters it would take 10 hours.
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:44.844]  But I'm sure you've seen the BBC, I'm sure you've seen NBC, we played some of it in the first of the show.
[02:00:45.545 --> 02:00:50.449]  Talking about how the forensic evidence from some of the leading experts in the world is at a big symposium.
[02:00:51.184 --> 02:00:59.510]  Proving that Sirhan Sirhan isn't the one that shot RFK when he won the nomination, basically locked it up out in California in 68.
[02:00:59.770 --> 02:01:06.415]  Now, remember the coroner in LA said he'd been shot in the back with a different caliber from what Sirhan Sirhan was shooting from the front.
[02:01:07.336 --> 02:01:09.778]  And so, this just adds evidence to it.
[02:01:10.879 --> 02:01:19.225]  But, right now on the line, we have Phillip Van Praag, and he's got a master's degree in engineering, electrical,
[02:01:20.847 --> 02:01:22.529]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:01:22.549 --> 02:01:30.534]  I mean, the best way is for Mr. Pragg to give us his credentials, what he thinks most important, and then get into the evidence.
[02:01:30.554 --> 02:01:34.197]  And we're still lining up his colleague, Dr. Robert Jolling.
[02:01:36.239 --> 02:01:40.702]  Mr. Pragg, please give us your credentials so I don't spend ten hours covering them.
[02:01:42.043 --> 02:01:44.485]  Well, you covered part of it, basically.
[02:01:44.545 --> 02:01:45.485]  I've been involved in
[02:01:46.738 --> 02:02:15.102]  Audio engineering for over 40 years, was a senior instructor at Ampex Corporation, just been involved in many different audio related tasks, and over the last three years have been analyzing the so-called Pruszynski recording, which is the only known recording of the actual shooting that took place there in the kitchen pantry at the Ambassador Hotel.
[02:02:18.571 --> 02:02:30.201]  Now, you've analyzed this recording, and you just had a big symposium that garnered national news attention, and a lot of other experts were there as well.
[02:02:30.221 --> 02:02:41.510]  And the report I've got is that you separately came up with your findings, and then you talked to your colleague, Dr. Robert Jolling, and that basically your info meshed together.
[02:02:42.586 --> 02:02:44.007]  Yes, that's correct.
[02:02:44.087 --> 02:02:52.952]  The symposium this week was at the Dr. Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science, which is an adjunct to the University of New Haven.
[02:02:53.832 --> 02:03:09.081]  And with regard to Dr. Joling, he and I met each other actually about a year ago, and this was in conjunction with a Discovery Times Channel documentary that was being filmed at that time.
[02:03:09.867 --> 02:03:12.689]  And both he and I participated in that.
[02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:24.939]  And during that particular program, my first two discoveries related to the analyzing of the Przezinski recording were brought out.
[02:03:25.039 --> 02:03:27.621]  And since that time, there's been a third discovery.
[02:03:28.308 --> 02:03:35.151]  And that third discovery was announced at the annual international convention of the A.A.F.S.
[02:03:35.211 --> 02:03:38.672]  American Academy of Forensic Sciences in Washington, D.C.
[02:03:38.712 --> 02:03:39.852]  last month.
[02:03:39.892 --> 02:03:42.213]  Now, all of this is separate from this week.
[02:03:42.333 --> 02:03:52.597]  At the same time breaking, BBC three-year investigation, four prominent CIA black-op commanders photographed and seen there at the Ambassador.
[02:03:52.837 --> 02:03:54.598]  This is really starting to get suspicious.
[02:03:56.457 --> 02:04:06.485]  Well, the approach that Dr. Joling and I have taken, and of course there's just the limited amount of time that two people have on this, we've focused our attention.
[02:04:07.225 --> 02:04:17.173]  Dr. Joling certainly, with regard to the physical evidence in this case, he's been involved with it literally from the beginning, met with
[02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:23.519]  The coroner, chief medical examiner, Dr. Robert Noguchi, as early as February of 69.
[02:04:24.319 --> 02:04:24.759]  Stay there!
[02:04:24.779 --> 02:04:26.460]  I want to hear all about this on the other side.
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:27.741]  We're honored to have you.
[02:04:27.781 --> 02:04:31.222]  We're also lining up the Dr. Jolling.
[02:04:32.662 --> 02:04:33.303]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:33.343 --> 02:04:37.044]  Let us out of this quick break for another 20 minutes with our two guests.
[02:04:37.084 --> 02:04:38.144]  Just so important.
[02:04:39.445 --> 02:04:42.846]  Sirhan Sirhan, isn't the guy shooting Robert Kennedy?
[02:04:43.546 --> 02:04:47.408]  Scientifically documented by the biggest experts we've got.
[02:04:48.573 --> 02:04:50.235]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:50.555 --> 02:04:53.978]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:54.178 --> 02:04:56.020]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:56.641 --> 02:04:59.403]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:59.704 --> 02:05:05.229]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:05.489 --> 02:05:09.433]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:09.753 --> 02:05:14.695]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[02:05:49.363 --> 02:05:52.204]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[02:05:52.704 --> 02:05:59.885]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[02:06:00.425 --> 02:06:07.687]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[02:06:08.267 --> 02:06:14.568]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.

[02:06:48.752 --> 02:06:49.032]  Fact.
[02:06:49.212 --> 02:06:55.136]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:06:55.256 --> 02:06:59.519]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:06:59.599 --> 02:07:07.103]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:07:07.324 --> 02:07:07.964]  The solution.
[02:07:08.104 --> 02:07:12.147]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:07:12.327 --> 02:07:14.328]  The Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:07:14.508 --> 02:07:14.828]  I'm good.
[02:07:33.624 --> 02:07:34.665]  We're good to go.
[02:07:52.987 --> 02:07:57.170]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:07:57.810 --> 02:07:58.630]  You want answers?
[02:07:59.411 --> 02:08:00.291]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:00.972 --> 02:08:04.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:05.154 --> 02:08:09.237]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:10.958 --> 02:08:15.741]  Well, Philip Van Praagh has worked with Dr. Robert Joling
[02:08:18.044 --> 02:08:24.248]  NBC calls them two of the leading experts in the world in their two respective fields.
[02:08:27.230 --> 02:08:40.159]  And the guest we have on right now, Philip Van Praagh's involvement in the audio field has spanned 45 years of forensic analysis of magnetic media recordings, including over 35 over those years.
[02:08:40.339 --> 02:08:47.044]  The context of his involvement in the field has been embodied both within the professional career and the result of ongoing independent research.
[02:08:47.897 --> 02:08:55.910]  And Dr. Joling, since right after the assassination, conferred with the coroner who said he was shot in the back, not from the front, different caliber.
[02:08:56.391 --> 02:08:57.973]  So this is an ongoing investigation.
[02:08:58.153 --> 02:09:02.721]  Why do you think it's starting to break now, starting to come out, Philip Van Praag?
[02:09:03.843 --> 02:09:05.484]  Well, I think there's a couple of factors.
[02:09:05.584 --> 02:09:14.592]  First, of course, we're approaching the 40th anniversary of the assassination, and that, I guess, has drawn media attention to it.
[02:09:15.092 --> 02:09:24.800]  Secondly, beginning last year with the discoveries that I have made and the first two of those being aired on the Discovery Times Channel documentary,
[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:27.622]  That has also brought some focus on it.
[02:09:28.122 --> 02:09:45.273]  And moreover, with the third discovery and its scientific implications, potential scientific implications, that interested additional people and has gotten to the point where now we have lectured a number of times this year on the assassination.
[02:09:45.594 --> 02:09:54.840]  Now, when we got cut off by the break, you were talking about the third discovery and Dr. Joling conferring right after the shooting, very soon thereafter, with the coroner in Los Angeles.
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.441]  Right, exactly.
[02:09:58.281 --> 02:10:18.629]  As I had mentioned, Dr. Joling has been involved in this case virtually from the beginning and has had the good fortune, partially, of his role as an attorney, a judge, a former president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, has given him access to a number of people involved in this case.
[02:10:18.689 --> 02:10:21.931]  In fact, they sought him out continually over the last 40 years.
[02:10:23.551 --> 02:10:50.927]  And it was through those associations and through hundreds and hundreds of personal letters that he received from these people that he put together just a huge file regarding this case but had never really published anything on it and it was the chance meeting that he and I had a year ago about the time that my first two discoveries were breaking that we decided to collaborate and the result was a book
[02:10:52.186 --> 02:10:53.287]  An open and shut case.
[02:10:54.507 --> 02:10:58.689]  And the website is anopenandshutcase.com and I want to have you both up.
[02:10:58.709 --> 02:11:02.391]  I think we've got a time zone mix-up with Dr. Joling in the next few weeks.
[02:11:02.411 --> 02:11:17.158]  We'll spend a full hour on this, but in the time we've got, go back to why Dr. Joling at first got in touch with the coroner, what the coroner said, and then move forward into the audio-acoustic evidence because
[02:11:18.428 --> 02:11:29.259]  Of course, we have the Congressional 79 hearings that said 95% chance, with some of the top experts of that day, that of course there was more than one shooter and more than three shots fired.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:35.185]  And that the Congress said they believed there was a conspiracy.
[02:11:36.506 --> 02:11:39.990]  And now we've had E. Howard Hunt on deathbed say that he ran the operation.
[02:11:40.706 --> 02:11:44.388]  We have photos from the newspapers of him being arrested as one of the tramps.
[02:11:44.448 --> 02:11:46.269]  I mean, it's really starting to pile up.
[02:11:46.349 --> 02:11:53.473]  I know you're focusing in on the scientific areas, but I mean, can you comment on the 79 congressional...
[02:11:54.662 --> 02:11:55.923]  Go ahead.
[02:11:55.983 --> 02:12:01.426]  Well, just going back, first of all, to your first question there regarding the 1969 involvement.
[02:12:01.786 --> 02:12:14.953]  It was actually Dr. Noguchi and two or three other very prominent individuals who had been involved from the very beginning who sought out Dr. Joling's expertise and counsel.
[02:12:16.194 --> 02:12:33.144]  There certainly were a number of issues that quickly emerged in this case, some of which you've already mentioned, but just very basically the eight-shot capacity of Sirhan's gun versus 14 or more bullet holes that were found in and around the pantry area, a number of which were documented by the FBI.
[02:12:34.285 --> 02:12:50.000]  One of their top people, Dr. William Bailey, as a matter of fact, who was there shortly after the shooting, testified over and over and over again that those, in fact, were bullet holes and bullets, irrespective of what others might have said at the time.
[02:12:50.421 --> 02:12:57.848]  Secondly, of course, there was Sirhan's position, which was in front of and three feet or more from Robert Kennedy at the time.
[02:12:58.408 --> 02:13:10.911]  Of the shooting, and that was, uh, has been verified by the statements of, uh, 12 or more eyewitnesses, people, uh, in the pantry at the time of the shooting who, who viewed the shooting, uh, firsthand.
[02:13:11.071 --> 02:13:19.654]  And the reason that's so important, the fact that he was three feet or more away and facing Robert Kennedy, uh, gets back to the autopsy findings.
[02:13:19.734 --> 02:13:24.395]  And the autopsy findings being that Kennedy was hit four times from the rear,
[02:13:25.835 --> 02:13:36.059]  And there was deeply embedded powder burns on his clothing and on his head and neck, indicating a point-blank range shot.
[02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:37.780]  And that was not conjecture.
[02:13:37.860 --> 02:13:44.203]  That was verified by a number of firearms experts, as well as Dr. Noguchi.
[02:13:44.603 --> 02:13:50.005]  In fact, after the shooting and after the autopsy, the LAPD, I believe,
[02:13:50.743 --> 02:14:10.458]  I ran some tests using, I guess, a pig's ear to simulate a human being hit at point-blank range versus other distances, and it was only, I guess, within a half inch of contact that such a deeply embedded powder burn were created.
[02:14:10.498 --> 02:14:13.260]  By deeply embedded, it burned deeply into the clothing and skin.
[02:14:14.381 --> 02:14:16.262]  Which is 101 in forensics.
[02:14:16.282 --> 02:14:20.806]  I know nothing about it, but everybody listening knows the basics of up close.
[02:14:22.647 --> 02:14:29.393]  You have the blast coming out, the superheated leftovers of the gunpowder.
[02:14:31.795 --> 02:14:35.058]  We have the footage, going back to JFK, of
[02:14:36.192 --> 02:14:43.715]  The Secret Service being ordered not to be around the car, and they're waving their arms and throwing fits, and Kennedy drives down and they kill him, and you have this.
[02:14:44.095 --> 02:14:47.116]  Fourteen bullet holes, digging the bullets out, his gun only shoots eight.
[02:14:47.516 --> 02:14:53.498]  Witnesses say that Sirhan's shooting from the front, he's shot at point-blank range from behind.
[02:14:53.518 --> 02:14:55.959]  I mean, how dumb do these people think we are?
[02:14:55.979 --> 02:14:58.340]  But I guess as a scientist, you just cover the facts.
[02:14:59.409 --> 02:15:00.270]  It's just amazing.
[02:15:00.310 --> 02:15:00.550]  Right.
[02:15:01.150 --> 02:15:01.650]  Exactly.
[02:15:01.670 --> 02:15:23.924]  We just covered the facts, and my third, just briefly to go through the three discoveries, the first one was, and this is as a result of analyzing the Krasinski recording, which was initially uncovered in 2004, by the way, by Brad Johnson, an American journalist and senior news writer for CNN International.
[02:15:24.956 --> 02:15:32.062]  Uh, and through my analysis, uh, the first discovery was the presence of at least 13 shot sounds on that recording.
[02:15:32.102 --> 02:15:43.032]  Now, it may have been more, because at that point in time, after five seconds of shots going off, uh, the crowd started audibly reacting.
[02:15:43.092 --> 02:15:44.573]  There were loud screams and shouts.
[02:15:44.613 --> 02:15:45.334]  Pandemonium!
[02:15:46.770 --> 02:15:51.655]  It just became impossible to be able to pick any other shot sounds out of that recording.
[02:15:52.035 --> 02:16:05.308]  The second discovery was two instances of what I call double shots, and that is two shots that occur so closely together that it raises doubt as to whether it could have been fired by a single weapon.
[02:16:05.709 --> 02:16:08.872]  And in fact, last year there was a firearms test
[02:16:09.392 --> 02:16:20.460]  Conducted in California with a firearms expert under ideal conditions, shooting the exact same make and model weapon, the Ivor Johnson Cadet 55.
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:32.128]  Fastest time he could come up with was 366 milliseconds between shots, whereas the double shots on the Przezinski recording, one pair is about 122 milliseconds apart, the other one's about 148, 149 milliseconds apart.
[02:16:32.148 --> 02:16:33.388]  So twice as fast as the top expert can do?
[02:16:39.386 --> 02:17:00.883]  Well, yes, and not only that, but after the second shot, Sir Hens' arm, gun arm, was pinned down on a stainless steel steam table in the pantry, although he was able to continue to fire off the rest of the round, and his other, and his, Carl Euker, the assistant maitre d', with his other arm, had
[02:17:01.864 --> 02:17:07.387]  Sir Hannon a headlock so it's hard to conceive that that is anywhere near ideal condition.
[02:17:07.747 --> 02:17:15.591]  But he had a job going there and squeeze off the rounds even though his first shots are up in the air and the others are down at the ground.
[02:17:16.891 --> 02:17:20.113]  Now what about witnesses about who was behind Kennedy at the time?
[02:17:21.528 --> 02:17:31.531]  Well, of course, immediately behind Senator Kennedy, and slightly to his right, was a security guard named Caesar.
[02:17:32.031 --> 02:17:36.293]  In fact, he had hold of Kennedy's right elbow with Caesar's left.
[02:17:36.973 --> 02:17:51.283]  And at the time that the shooting occurred, and Cesar claimed afterwards, stated that Kennedy falling over from the shot resulted in Mr. Cesar also falling down.
[02:17:51.984 --> 02:17:59.669]  And Cesar also mentioned that he received extensive powder burns, that is, Cesar, in his face and eyes.
[02:18:00.773 --> 02:18:28.673]  uh... as a result of the shot when you look at the fact that their handgun was three feet or more away and he was uh... taking pretty much in the direction of that gun versus the evidence from the coroner which indicated that kennedy was shot from the rear at point-blank range uh... one would have to assume that the gun was in a position sideways to the face of mister caesar and
[02:18:29.444 --> 02:18:30.505]  Very, very close.
[02:18:30.685 --> 02:18:42.871]  And anyone, of course, who's fired a revolver will know that there is a tremendous amount of blast of powder that exits between the rear of the cylinder and the frame of the gun.
[02:18:43.311 --> 02:18:49.174]  At the time it's fired off, no one would fire, willingly, fire off a gun with that
[02:18:49.794 --> 02:18:51.515]  What is the third new info?
[02:19:12.819 --> 02:19:23.702]  Although the other frequency, the other shot sounds had very similar frequency content, there were five of the shot sounds contained an anomaly.
[02:19:24.242 --> 02:19:34.624]  And that anomaly was a particular frequency that presented, again, at a particular frequency and at a considerably higher level.
[02:19:34.884 --> 02:19:37.905]  So it's clearly two different types of guns going off.
[02:19:38.145 --> 02:19:38.945]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:39.366 --> 02:19:39.826]  Stay with us.
[02:19:48.857 --> 02:19:50.278]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:50.298 --> 02:19:52.380]  A New World Order.
[02:19:53.100 --> 02:19:57.523]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:57.603 --> 02:20:00.786]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:00.826 --> 02:20:03.088]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:06.070]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.810 --> 02:20:14.116]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:17.148 --> 02:20:22.111]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:22.592 --> 02:20:26.054]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.454 --> 02:20:28.936]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:29.016 --> 02:20:30.177]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:30.197 --> 02:20:30.957]  They're not after money.
[02:20:30.977 --> 02:20:32.058]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.258 --> 02:20:32.959]  They're after power.
[02:20:33.239 --> 02:20:34.259]  That's what they're after these days.

[02:24:12.112 --> 02:24:15.214]  I mean, it's just so obvious.
[02:24:15.255 --> 02:24:17.356]  Fourteen bullets when the gun only holds eight.
[02:24:17.917 --> 02:24:19.157]  Now, the last point you were making,
[02:24:20.934 --> 02:24:27.259]  Are you saying that even with the ear can hear, but you said you studied the frequency, that it's clearly two different sounds.
[02:24:27.279 --> 02:24:28.780]  Like a shotgun's like BOOM!
[02:24:29.381 --> 02:24:33.885]  And a certain size handgun with a certain length of muzzle is BOOM!
[02:24:35.326 --> 02:24:39.109]  But as a scientist you were able to separate out that it was two different types of guns?
[02:24:40.414 --> 02:24:46.378]  Yes, it was actually a very subtle difference and really could not be heard just by the human ear.
[02:24:47.258 --> 02:24:56.644]  But through forensic analysis, we noted five of the shot sounds that had this frequency anomaly, and we didn't know what the cause of it was.
[02:24:56.704 --> 02:25:02.348]  And other people would say, well, it could be the acoustics in the pantry or something to do with Brzezinski's recorder or whatever.
[02:25:03.208 --> 02:25:06.169]  Uh, but then why would it only occur with five of the shots out?
[02:25:06.229 --> 02:25:17.413]  So to prove one way or the other and try to determine the source of this, we conducted a firearms test using an Ivor Johnson Cadet 55 Sirhan's weapon and also using an H&R 922.
[02:25:19.731 --> 02:25:35.315]  And we found, as a result of doing those tests, we found the same anomaly occurring from the H&R 922 from the rear, which in fact would have been roughly the position of that weapon in the kitchen pantry relative to Brzezinski's microphone.
[02:25:35.835 --> 02:25:37.997]  What's interesting about that weapon is two things.
[02:25:38.077 --> 02:26:01.211]  First of all, it happens to have the same rifling characteristics as the Ivor Johnson Cadet 55, which is a very important consideration with regard to the firearms panel, the Judge Wenke panel in 75, which found a match between one of the Kennedy victim bullets and a couple of other victims in that kitchen pantry.
[02:26:01.932 --> 02:26:08.777]  The second point is that it happened to be the same model weapon that the security guard, St.
[02:26:08.857 --> 02:26:12.180]  Eugene Caesar, happened to own at the time of the shooting.
[02:26:12.660 --> 02:26:23.969]  Now, after the shooting, I believe Mr. Caesar had first indicated that he had sold that weapon a couple of months prior to the shooting, whereas it was later uncovered that he had sold the weapon.
[02:26:24.729 --> 02:26:27.190]  Uh, several months after the shooting.
[02:26:27.670 --> 02:26:47.557]  So that was the reason for using that second weapon, and although we did not find the frequency anomaly anywhere, either front or rear, with the Ivor Johnson Cadet 55, we did find it with the H&R 922 from the back of the weapon about 40 feet away, which is about the distance between Brzezinski's microphone and the
[02:26:48.799 --> 02:27:12.906]  Firearms at the time of the shooting so basically just drug up a mental patient have him go shoot his gun eight times Have your black op operators shoot Bobby five times and you're off the races and all the witnesses see it and the guy that owns the same gun and nothing matters It's just you just tell the American people that ham sandwich killed Bobby and they believe it meanwhile I guess sir hands still just drooling in prison and
[02:27:14.271 --> 02:27:23.056]  He is still in prison after about 40 years and certainly he should not be completely exonerated.
[02:27:23.176 --> 02:27:24.257]  After all, he was there.
[02:27:24.297 --> 02:27:25.418]  He did fire his weapon.
[02:27:26.338 --> 02:27:37.325]  But we very firmly believe that Sirhan could not and did not kill Robert F. Kennedy, never even hit Robert F. Kennedy in that kitchen pantry.
[02:27:37.585 --> 02:27:40.787]  How did the media spin it and cover it up when the coroner
[02:27:41.721 --> 02:27:46.647]  The LA coroner said that Sirhan didn't even shoot him and that it was somebody else from behind.
[02:27:46.687 --> 02:27:53.676]  I mean, it's just... Well, initially, the Los Angeles Police Department had...
[02:27:55.294 --> 02:28:04.479]  For whatever reasons they may have had discredited Dr. Noguchi, but that didn't last.
[02:28:04.559 --> 02:28:12.544]  He was, of course, reinstated to his position and there was a great outpouring of support for him by his colleagues.
[02:28:13.524 --> 02:28:16.185]  All around the nation, and eventually around the world.
[02:28:16.285 --> 02:28:25.648]  And in fact, the autopsy protocol for Robert F. Kennedy is widely considered to be one of the finest autopsy protocols ever written.
[02:28:26.729 --> 02:28:34.232]  Well, you know, they say that Budo, over in Pakistan, hit her head on a car window.
[02:28:34.252 --> 02:28:40.654]  Of course, there's now video of the machine gunning her, but I guess we should just believe our media, sir, and not believe you.
[02:28:43.004 --> 02:29:08.728]  Well, like I say, and as we stated earlier in the program, the media is becoming more involved in this now, and hopefully, as opposed to just simple five-second sound bites, which of course are extremely easy to counter by those who do not have the facts, but rather it's hoped that the media will actually spend some time on this and go in-depth and take the time to learn the evidence.
[02:29:09.523 --> 02:29:13.284]  The physical evidence and the forensic evidence behind the finding.
[02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:15.325]  Absolutely.
[02:29:15.385 --> 02:29:17.106]  Thank you for spending so much time with us.

[02:32:57.215 --> 02:32:59.216]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:32:59.636 --> 02:33:02.838]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[02:33:02.938 --> 02:33:07.460]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:09.500]  Big John!
[02:33:10.801 --> 02:33:13.142]  Big John!
[02:33:13.642 --> 02:33:16.023]  Big Bad John!
[02:33:16.543 --> 02:33:17.504]  Big John!
[02:33:19.693 --> 02:33:21.133]  Well, he is a veteran of the
[02:33:49.946 --> 02:33:51.708]  The European Theater in World War II.
[02:33:51.748 --> 02:33:52.830]  He's a member of Congress.
[02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:57.856]  Also one of New York's longest serving and most popular governors.
[02:33:59.357 --> 02:34:04.103]  And he joins us for the balance of the broadcast today for the next 25 minutes or so.
[02:34:04.203 --> 02:34:05.965]  He's former New York Mayor Ed Koch.
[02:34:05.985 --> 02:34:06.786]  He's written 16 books.
[02:34:08.656 --> 02:34:18.698]  And he's here with us today to talk about his newest book, The Koch Papers, and a book he wrote years ago, I think in 99, about the nasty little Rudolph Giuliani.
[02:34:19.099 --> 02:34:21.619]  So we'll get some of his comments on that as well.
[02:34:22.139 --> 02:34:23.740]  Mayor Koch, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:25.960]  Just a small correction.
[02:34:26.060 --> 02:34:26.940]  I was never governor.
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.941]  I was just mayor.
[02:34:28.821 --> 02:34:29.781]  I think you said governor.
[02:34:30.201 --> 02:34:34.382]  No, well, if I did, I thought I said... You said mayor and governor.
[02:34:35.682 --> 02:34:37.363]  You did, but it doesn't make a difference.
[02:34:37.383 --> 02:34:37.943]  I was just mayor.
[02:34:38.638 --> 02:34:39.559]  You ran for Governor.
[02:34:40.379 --> 02:34:41.340]  I ran for Governor, right.
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:44.362]  I thought I was talking about you were in Congress, but I must have said Governor instead.
[02:34:44.623 --> 02:34:44.763]  Right.
[02:34:45.083 --> 02:34:52.649]  Okay, um... That's a good tactic when we start the interview, so you can get me off balance here, Mayor Cotts.
[02:34:53.029 --> 02:34:55.711]  Well, we're not... I'm teasing you.
[02:34:56.091 --> 02:35:06.939]  No, no, no, I'm just teasing you because I watch videos of you online during press conferences and stuff, and I guess everybody needs correcting, because we do get a lot of stuff wrong.
[02:35:08.965 --> 02:35:10.306]  Listen, tell us about the new book.
[02:35:11.306 --> 02:35:14.227]  Well, I wrote a book, which I'm very proud of.
[02:35:14.287 --> 02:35:34.076]  It's my latest and my best, and it's called The Koch Papers, and it is a compilation of the statements that I've made and the commentaries I've issued and the speeches, and really first rate, beginning with my days in Congress up until recently on the issue of anti-Semitism.
[02:35:35.696 --> 02:35:37.337]  We're fortunate in the United States
[02:35:38.350 --> 02:35:40.391]  This is really the golden age.
[02:35:41.371 --> 02:35:42.992]  Of course, there are anti-Semites.
[02:35:43.092 --> 02:35:49.035]  The pastor of Obama is an anti-Semite.
[02:35:49.755 --> 02:36:04.161]  But the fact is that anti-Semitism is vastly decreased, but rising in Europe to the point where it's close to where it was in the 30s, just before World War II.
[02:36:04.941 --> 02:36:06.862]  Well, that's an amazing statement right there.
[02:36:08.402 --> 02:36:18.949]  Mayor Koch, I've seen the quotes about the government vetting AIDS or the government shipping in drugs for the black people, but I haven't heard him make any anti-Semitic comments.
[02:36:18.969 --> 02:36:20.790]  Can you tell me specifically what Barack Obama's...?
[02:36:21.931 --> 02:36:30.477]  Yes, he has... You know, when you attack Israel, you have a right to attack Israel, but if you attack it,
[02:36:31.318 --> 02:36:40.987]  Uh, by, uh, when you would not attack another country for doing the same thing, then it's anti-Semitism in my judgment.
[02:36:41.267 --> 02:36:42.668]  So let me give you an illustration.
[02:36:44.464 --> 02:36:44.785]  I think?
[02:37:01.631 --> 02:37:06.794]  Then the Nazis treated the Jews as ridiculous.
[02:37:07.254 --> 02:37:12.817]  And secondly, what the Israelis are doing is, for example, what the Turks are doing today.
[02:37:12.837 --> 02:37:22.802]  They go into Iraq to go after the terrorists that entered Turkey to kill Turks.
[02:37:23.183 --> 02:37:25.644]  And I haven't seen anybody criticize
[02:37:26.544 --> 02:37:28.326]  The Turks for doing that.
[02:37:28.386 --> 02:37:30.668]  That's the right of self-defense.
[02:37:30.688 --> 02:37:38.474]  Well, Mayor Koch, you were in Congress, weren't you, at the same time that Jimmy Carter was in office?
[02:37:39.135 --> 02:37:39.495]  I was.
[02:37:40.316 --> 02:37:44.299]  And I've seen photos with you meeting with him.
[02:37:44.319 --> 02:37:48.062]  I mean, would you call him friends?
[02:37:48.323 --> 02:37:52.346]  I mean, are you saying that Jimmy Carter, or would you say Jimmy Carter is anti-Semitic?
[02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:54.622]  No, I wouldn't say he was anti-Semitic.
[02:37:54.642 --> 02:37:58.368]  I would say he was hostile to Israel, but not anti-Semitic.
[02:37:58.408 --> 02:37:59.209]  There is a difference.
[02:37:59.249 --> 02:38:08.001]  You can be critical of Israel if you criticize it for the same reasons that you criticize other countries.
[02:38:08.862 --> 02:38:24.829]  Jimmy Carter criticizes a lot of countries, but I haven't heard, in this case, Reverend Wright or anybody else criticize Turkey for doing what Israel does, which is defend its people from terrorist attacks.
[02:38:25.209 --> 02:38:39.413]  The difference is the Kurds didn't have that area of Turkey, and Israel has been expanding and pushing the Palestinians into smaller and smaller areas and demolishing the houses.
[02:38:39.534 --> 02:38:40.274]  Let me defend that.
[02:38:40.314 --> 02:38:50.457]  Firstly, Israel has agreed to the two-state solution called the Roadmap, which President Bush and others have urged.
[02:38:51.017 --> 02:39:08.187]  The Palestinians under Hamas in the West Bank says no, every Jew who entered historic Palestine after 1917 must be expelled and there will be one Muslim state.
[02:39:08.827 --> 02:39:14.771]  I think that's a threat to Jews who are now about six million.
[02:39:14.811 --> 02:39:16.732]  Mayor Koch, I'm not...
[02:39:18.121 --> 02:39:24.325]  Denying that there are a lot of Palestinians, a lot of Arabs that say push all the Jews into the ocean and the rest of the... A majority.
[02:39:24.845 --> 02:39:26.126]  Yeah.
[02:39:26.366 --> 02:39:28.007]  A majority in the West Bank.
[02:39:28.307 --> 02:39:37.352]  My whole statement is, is that the Arabs were not there killing Jews until 47, 48, when Israel blew up the hotel.
[02:39:37.493 --> 02:39:38.433]  That is not true.
[02:39:38.833 --> 02:39:46.538]  It happens that in, for example, in the mid-30s, the Arabs killed every Jew in Hebron.
[02:39:47.412 --> 02:39:49.293]  In the mid-30s the Jews were living.
[02:39:49.593 --> 02:40:04.143]  You may not accept it as such, I don't know, maybe you do, but Jews have lived in the area which was known originally as Judea and Samaria until the Romans
[02:40:04.723 --> 02:40:07.065]  destroyed the Jewish kingdoms.
[02:40:07.746 --> 02:40:16.994]  They continue to... Oh, I totally agree with you that Sephardic Jews that are 20% of the Jewish family certainly have been there for 3,000 years.
[02:40:17.034 --> 02:40:30.767]  Yeah, and you may not accept it as such, but in the Bible it says that God made a pact with the Jews that the area
[02:40:32.288 --> 02:40:37.752]  Well, actually, God ordered the Jews to go in and kill everybody, including their animals.
[02:40:38.965 --> 02:40:44.709]  Well, he may have, I don't really know that section, but that's not what you or I are talking about.
[02:40:45.010 --> 02:40:51.915]  I'm simply saying that from a historical point of view, this is the land of the Jews.
[02:40:52.495 --> 02:41:03.243]  Well, Mayor Koch, I get criticized because I don't go with what's fashionable and just bash Israel all day.
[02:41:03.383 --> 02:41:06.045]  I'm really trying to show both sides here.
[02:41:06.085 --> 02:41:07.326]  I'll tell you what I don't like.
[02:41:08.330 --> 02:41:21.880]  What I don't like is the fact that in Europe, the different governmental organizations, the different lobbying groups, have tried to push to even, you know, ban people's political free speech.
[02:41:22.100 --> 02:41:28.585]  Even if I don't agree with what someone is saying about Hitler, I think they have a right.
[02:41:28.605 --> 02:41:30.186]  I think they have a right to say it.
[02:41:30.606 --> 02:41:31.447]  Let me explain to you.
[02:41:31.467 --> 02:41:32.988]  So do you agree with the First Amendment or not?
[02:41:34.598 --> 02:41:37.101]  Of course, in the United States we have the First Amendment.
[02:41:37.341 --> 02:41:39.483]  They've never had the First Amendment in Europe.
[02:41:39.584 --> 02:41:42.186]  I know, but if you think we should have it here, they should have it there.
[02:41:42.847 --> 02:41:43.808]  No, not at all.
[02:41:44.209 --> 02:41:54.200]  Each country has its own laws, and in Europe, because of Adolf Hitler, in Germany and France,
[02:41:54.739 --> 02:42:06.667]  And in England, they have said that you may not, under penalty of criminal law, say that there was a holocaust.
[02:42:07.007 --> 02:42:10.750]  Now, holocaust deniers say, oh, Hitler didn't kill the Jews.
[02:42:10.830 --> 02:42:13.332]  But, Mayor Koch, we know what they say, Mayor Koch.
[02:42:14.072 --> 02:42:16.454]  And we certainly know Hitler killed a lot of Jews and a lot of other people.
[02:42:16.714 --> 02:42:17.774]  I'm not debating that.
[02:42:18.675 --> 02:42:23.138]  Yeah, and about 20 million Germans died and he killed about 7 million Poles.
[02:42:23.258 --> 02:42:25.840]  Hitler didn't kill 20 million Germans.
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:26.521]  20 million Germans died.
[02:42:26.541 --> 02:42:26.861]  The Russians.
[02:42:27.301 --> 02:42:29.363]  And we killed 20 million Germans.
[02:42:29.383 --> 02:42:31.264]  So you're not arguing with that 20 million number?
[02:42:31.585 --> 02:42:35.428]  Because they were fighting a war.
[02:42:35.868 --> 02:42:37.649]  Maricosh, you don't even know where I'm coming from here.
[02:42:37.669 --> 02:42:38.670]  Let me just get my point out.
[02:42:39.010 --> 02:42:41.112]  Because I really want to hear what you have to say about this.
[02:42:41.352 --> 02:42:41.712]  Of course.
[02:42:42.012 --> 02:42:44.955]  Okay, I mean, look, both my grandfathers were over there.
[02:42:45.375 --> 02:42:46.716]  So believe me, I know about it, okay?
[02:42:46.736 --> 02:42:48.017]  They were over there at the same time you were.
[02:42:48.616 --> 02:42:51.259]  Okay, so we're on the same team here when it comes to that.
[02:42:51.699 --> 02:43:00.848]  My whole point is, I wasn't going to give the numbers, millions of Poles, millions of Russians, millions of Germans, and yes, Hitler did target Jews, that was his whole schtick.
[02:43:00.888 --> 02:43:02.389]  We know that, it was horrible.
[02:43:02.850 --> 02:43:03.991]  My whole point is...
[02:43:04.671 --> 02:43:16.597]  Is that once you say, and there are groups here trying to restrict free speech in the US, same groups, once you say... Nobody is trying to restrict free speech in the United States, and it's foolish to say that.
[02:43:16.917 --> 02:43:25.721]  And let me just... Well, I'll say this, the ADL and everybody else runs over to Europe and supports what they're doing, and they... You see, you're not staying on point.
[02:43:26.721 --> 02:43:31.505]  I have said to you, Europe does not have the First Amendment.
[02:43:31.945 --> 02:43:34.487]  And they never had it, and they don't want it.
[02:43:34.787 --> 02:43:36.868]  So you're saying... They don't want it.
[02:43:36.948 --> 02:43:38.329]  You're saying they don't have any free speech.
[02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:39.510]  They don't have any free speech.
[02:43:39.950 --> 02:43:40.210]  No.
[02:43:41.011 --> 02:43:43.313]  A committee is going to decide.
[02:43:43.393 --> 02:43:44.794]  A committee is going to decide who has free speech.
[02:43:44.814 --> 02:43:45.614]  Not a committee.
[02:43:46.074 --> 02:43:55.701]  The fact is that the governments of the countries that I've told you about have decided that it is in their interest
[02:43:56.441 --> 02:44:00.365]  Not to allow the resurgence of Neo-Nazism.
[02:44:00.485 --> 02:44:03.287]  I understand that, but now they've expanded it, Mayor.
[02:44:03.588 --> 02:44:10.193]  Now they've expanded it to don't criticize the EU, don't criticize immigrants flooding in.
[02:44:10.233 --> 02:44:10.674]  That's baloney.
[02:44:10.694 --> 02:44:11.534]  You want to bet money?
[02:44:11.594 --> 02:44:13.256]  I've got all the headlines.
[02:44:13.456 --> 02:44:17.760]  They arrest you in England if you say the word homosexual, because they've decided that's not...
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:18.620]  That's right.
[02:44:18.821 --> 02:44:22.383]  You know, you're saying things that are ridiculous.
[02:44:22.403 --> 02:44:23.944]  Robin Page, BBC.
[02:44:23.964 --> 02:44:24.464]  10,000 bucks.
[02:44:24.484 --> 02:44:25.525]  10,000 dollars, Mayor Koch.
[02:44:25.925 --> 02:44:26.286]  Right now.
[02:44:26.306 --> 02:44:26.646]  That's baloney.
[02:44:26.986 --> 02:44:27.907]  Robin, bet me.
[02:44:27.947 --> 02:44:28.947]  That's sheer baloney.
[02:44:28.967 --> 02:44:29.288]  Bet me.
[02:44:29.308 --> 02:44:30.448]  It's what you do.
[02:44:30.669 --> 02:44:32.990]  Robin Page was arrested.
[02:44:33.350 --> 02:44:35.352]  BBC reporter for saying the word homosexual.
[02:44:35.892 --> 02:44:42.557]  It's ridiculous, and I don't believe it, and it isn't true, and I don't know your particular case, but let me go a little further.
[02:44:43.057 --> 02:44:48.460]  The reason, you know, what you're conveying is, well, so what if they killed 6 million Jews?
[02:44:48.481 --> 02:44:51.563]  They killed 20 million... That's not what I said!
[02:44:51.583 --> 02:44:54.565]  What I said is that you shouldn't take people's free speech!
[02:44:54.625 --> 02:44:55.585]  That's what Hitler did!
[02:44:55.685 --> 02:44:56.506]  I want to go a little further.
[02:44:56.826 --> 02:45:04.211]  I wanted to draw a distinction for you as to why the Holocaust is different
[02:45:04.807 --> 02:45:10.834]  In a lot of respects than the killing of any other group, even as terrible as it was.
[02:45:11.114 --> 02:45:12.536]  And I will tell you what the difference is.
[02:45:13.197 --> 02:45:23.889]  Hitler issued an order called the Final Solution, which said that every Jew in the countries in which Nazism prevailed
[02:45:24.669 --> 02:45:29.533]  Would be killed, baby, infant, child, man, woman.
[02:45:29.993 --> 02:45:33.435]  No child could be adopted to save the child's life.
[02:45:33.936 --> 02:45:36.478]  No Jew could convert to Christianity.
[02:45:36.498 --> 02:45:37.678]  It was an extermination plan.
[02:45:38.339 --> 02:45:38.859]  Exactly.
[02:45:39.179 --> 02:45:42.642]  And that was not what he did with any other people.
[02:45:42.962 --> 02:45:43.983]  And that's the difference.
[02:45:44.163 --> 02:45:49.887]  Oh, I agree with you earlier that the base of Nazism was to go after the Jews.
[02:45:49.907 --> 02:45:51.548]  I mean, I've read Mein Kampf.
[02:45:52.529 --> 02:45:53.750]  I understand what's going on there.
[02:45:54.430 --> 02:46:08.278]  Mayor Koch, and I'm not arguing with you, all I'm trying to say is that you're not aware of all the new hate speech laws, even in England, that has no connection?
[02:46:08.298 --> 02:46:12.240]  Listen, you're not in England, you're in the United States.
[02:46:12.821 --> 02:46:22.186]  The English have a tradition of being very free with speech, but they have decided
[02:46:22.964 --> 02:46:25.549]  That they have to put limitations on it.
[02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:27.613]  That's their decision.
[02:46:27.633 --> 02:46:29.637]  No, that's the government.
[02:46:29.858 --> 02:46:33.605]  The British people don't want to join the EU, and the government's forcing it down their throat.
[02:46:33.985 --> 02:46:34.647]  Look, look.
[02:46:35.554 --> 02:46:39.818]  Look, it is a threat to freedom to have a tax on free speech, Koch.
[02:46:41.239 --> 02:46:43.601]  You can't say you support free speech in the U.S.
[02:46:43.881 --> 02:46:47.504]  and then go to Europe and be the head of the U.S.
[02:46:47.524 --> 02:46:58.813]  delegation to go over there with that whole agenda off of the people that got killed taking people's free speech today using the dumb Nazis as your poster boy to take other people's free speech.
[02:46:58.973 --> 02:47:03.417]  Now listen, nobody from here is taking anybody's free speech.
[02:47:03.917 --> 02:47:24.323]  Each government in Germany, they decided that if you did not clamp down on neo-Nazism and do that by saying that if you revere Hitler, if you engage in a fascist Nazi salute, you're breaking the German law.
[02:47:24.723 --> 02:47:26.003]  You want to change that.
[02:47:26.363 --> 02:47:28.924]  Germans are very happy to have that.
[02:47:30.310 --> 02:47:31.251]  Well, I know this.
[02:47:31.391 --> 02:47:46.823]  BBC and Der Spiegel reported that the Germans, a government since the 60s, has been caught heading up the neo-Nazi groups that they allow to operate and were caught provocateuring firebombing attacks against Turks as a pretext to pass such laws.
[02:47:47.104 --> 02:47:48.465]  That's ridiculous!
[02:47:49.165 --> 02:47:53.669]  And that's what is known as the conspiracy theories in the United States.
[02:47:53.689 --> 02:47:55.530]  Mayor Kotz, you know what we're going to do with this interview?
[02:47:55.930 --> 02:48:00.794]  We're going to take your statements saying that they didn't arrest Robin Page for... No, no.
[02:48:00.994 --> 02:48:05.518]  I don't even know who Robin Page... And we're going to put the articles up where it says that.
[02:48:05.538 --> 02:48:08.560]  I don't even know who... I don't even... Please, give me...
[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:11.663]  I don't even know who Robin Page is!
[02:48:12.183 --> 02:48:21.832]  I am simply saying to you, when you say that in England they arrest you for saying the word homosexual, I say that's junk, not true.
[02:48:25.928 --> 02:48:33.732]  No, they say that the police decide if it was meant as condescending because scientific terms now are seen as threatening.
[02:48:33.752 --> 02:48:39.515]  The police don't decide, they arrest, and a court decides whether you engage in hate speech.
[02:48:39.735 --> 02:48:44.538]  You didn't know they have police that go to restaurants and sit listening randomly for people using racial terms?
[02:48:44.558 --> 02:48:46.319]  Oh, I don't believe that for one minute.
[02:48:47.951 --> 02:48:50.715]  You're filled with conspiracy theories.
[02:48:50.815 --> 02:48:51.656]  It's really peculiar.
[02:48:51.676 --> 02:48:52.377]  Hey, let me guess.
[02:48:53.018 --> 02:48:55.661]  The North American Union doesn't exist either, right?
[02:48:56.001 --> 02:48:57.003]  Let me ask you something.
[02:48:57.263 --> 02:49:02.750]  Do you think it was the Arabs who blew up the World Trade Center, or do you think it was the Jews?
[02:49:03.130 --> 02:49:05.073]  Well, that brings me to my next point.
[02:49:06.944 --> 02:49:11.126]  Mayor Koch, I'm going to answer your question.
[02:49:11.887 --> 02:49:18.190]  I do not believe that the Jews carried out the attack on the World Trade Centers.
[02:49:18.270 --> 02:49:28.796]  And I also know that the Pensacola News Journal, the Associated Press, the San Jose Mercury News, and Newsweek all reported that the hijackers were trained at U.S.
[02:49:28.816 --> 02:49:29.637]  military bases.
[02:49:30.758 --> 02:49:31.278]  That's correct.
[02:49:32.205 --> 02:49:32.946]  Not U.S.
[02:49:32.986 --> 02:49:33.446]  military.
[02:49:33.726 --> 02:49:37.369]  They were private training places.
[02:49:37.629 --> 02:49:38.189]  No.
[02:49:38.249 --> 02:49:39.030]  Separate from that.
[02:49:39.050 --> 02:49:48.496]  That's what it... Listen, I can't... You're so full of misinformation, and if you're pervading this every day, you're polluting the airways.
[02:49:48.536 --> 02:49:49.877]  Should I have my free speech taken?
[02:49:51.181 --> 02:49:51.541]  No!
[02:49:51.762 --> 02:49:53.303]  You can say whatever you want to!
[02:49:53.323 --> 02:49:54.824]  Should the Fairness Doctrine be brought back?
[02:49:55.184 --> 02:49:55.784]  No!
[02:49:55.904 --> 02:49:56.545]  I don't believe that.
[02:49:56.605 --> 02:49:58.426]  I believe you can say whatever you want to.
[02:49:58.586 --> 02:50:10.935]  Hey, Mayor Koch, I actually think you're a funny, smart character, and I want to come back and talk about Giuliani, because I don't like him either, and I want to end this on a friendly note, but I'll just say this as we go to break, okay?
[02:50:12.016 --> 02:50:16.419]  If you look at 9-11, and you look at how they massed more than 70,000 US and British troops,
[02:50:19.588 --> 02:50:24.330]  around Afghanistan and have the aircraft carriers and Bush signed the order to attack Afghanistan the day before 9-11.
[02:50:25.690 --> 02:50:34.534]  And if you look at how building 7 wasn't hit by a plane but fell, and you look at NORAD standing down, and you look at Bush running the 9-11 whitewash commission, that's why there's questions.
[02:50:34.574 --> 02:50:39.716]  So to say that because a minority says Jews did it, the majority of 9-11 truth doesn't say that.
[02:50:39.956 --> 02:50:41.136]  So I want to get your take on that.
[02:50:41.496 --> 02:50:42.657]  Let me get back on the other side.
[02:50:43.077 --> 02:50:45.718]  Mayor Ed Koch, his new book, The Koch Papers.
[02:50:49.079 --> 02:50:50.480]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:52.622]  A New World Order.
[02:50:53.323 --> 02:50:57.807]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:57.827 --> 02:51:01.009]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:01.049 --> 02:51:03.291]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:51:03.852 --> 02:51:06.294]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:07.014 --> 02:51:14.341]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.369 --> 02:51:22.332]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:22.793 --> 02:51:26.195]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:48.090 --> 02:51:49.951]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:51:50.151 --> 02:51:53.213]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:51:53.453 --> 02:51:58.076]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:51:58.416 --> 02:52:01.058]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:52:01.398 --> 02:52:08.143]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:52:08.363 --> 02:52:14.086]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:52:14.426 --> 02:52:16.067]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:52:16.567 --> 02:52:20.349]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:52:20.830 --> 02:52:25.352]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong.
[02:52:25.552 --> 02:52:31.793]  That they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[02:52:32.194 --> 02:52:37.235]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[02:52:37.475 --> 02:52:40.496]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[02:52:40.736 --> 02:52:41.196]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:52:41.276 --> 02:52:42.956]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:57.852]  USCivilFlags.org is here to help Americans remember as well as our leaders that every man and woman is sovereign and that we're all endowed by our Creator with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:52:58.073 --> 02:53:06.823]  The Sovereign Civil Flag is available at USCivilFlags.org and is a symbol of our desire to return America to the dreams that our forefathers envisioned.

[02:53:43.779 --> 02:53:54.685]  Alright, Mayor Koch, in Congress, ran for Governor.
[02:53:56.286 --> 02:53:58.507]  Mayor, multiple times, very popular.
[02:53:58.747 --> 02:54:00.428]  New book, The Koch Papers.
[02:54:01.497 --> 02:54:03.740]  Just type Ed Koch into Google, you can find it all.
[02:54:05.261 --> 02:54:14.331]  Look, I was talking to her in the break, Mayor, and I actually believe there's a global eugenics program, Planned Parenthood, set up by the Rockefellers who funded Hitler.
[02:54:15.292 --> 02:54:19.197]  I know you got questioned by We Are Change a week or so ago, and they brought up
[02:54:19.818 --> 02:54:23.919]  Prescott Bush was in the New York Times back in the 40s being the head Nazi agent in the U.S.
[02:54:24.260 --> 02:54:25.640]  You said you knew nothing about it.
[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:39.705]  I find it hard to believe that you've lived in New York and New Jersey most of your life and that you didn't know its common knowledge and Ben, the headlines in the BBC, the headlines, London Guardian in the last five years, this has all come back out.
[02:54:39.765 --> 02:54:40.645]  Were you aware of all that?
[02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:47.971]  Of all the things that you just said about the Nazis and the Rockefellers and the press got pushed?
[02:54:48.572 --> 02:54:48.912]  Uh, no.
[02:54:49.193 --> 02:54:51.697]  Did you know the Rockefellers were the main funders of Hitler?
[02:54:52.648 --> 02:54:53.369]  They may have been.
[02:54:54.169 --> 02:54:56.451]  You know, if I don't know something, I don't argue it.
[02:54:57.771 --> 02:55:00.913]  You know about American businessmen like the head of IBM, Thomas Watson?
[02:55:00.994 --> 02:55:01.834]  Oh yes, there were!
[02:55:02.154 --> 02:55:13.041]  There's no question that there were businessmen all around the world that were funding Adolf Hitler and Father Coughlin here in the United States.
[02:55:14.342 --> 02:55:17.704]  Nazis, fascists, no question about that.
[02:55:18.065 --> 02:55:21.427]  But, thank God, we beat them.
[02:55:22.063 --> 02:55:30.312]  And what's most interesting about beating them is, without the Russians, we would never have beaten Adolf Hitler.
[02:55:31.011 --> 02:55:42.515]  And they sacrificed 10 million troops, the Russians did, 300,000 in taking Berlin.
[02:55:42.535 --> 02:55:51.378]  So I'm shocked and surprised that we don't have a greater partnership with the Russians.
[02:55:51.398 --> 02:55:55.360]  Well it might be because Stalin killed conservatively 60 million.
[02:55:56.631 --> 02:56:02.094]  I think that's probably a correct figure of his own people, not the Germans.
[02:56:02.114 --> 02:56:04.455]  So that's why we don't have a better relationship?
[02:56:04.655 --> 02:56:06.956]  No, but Russia is not Stalin.
[02:56:07.416 --> 02:56:08.917]  I mean, they're not Democrats.
[02:56:08.997 --> 02:56:09.717]  Exactly!
[02:56:09.877 --> 02:56:13.619]  And governments, Israel doing bad things, Egypt doing bad things.
[02:56:13.939 --> 02:56:17.641]  You know, that isn't Egyptians are bad, that isn't Jews are bad, it isn't Germans are bad.
[02:56:17.901 --> 02:56:22.924]  It's that we get taken, we get bad people in power, we get seduced by evil, and that brings me to my last point.
[02:56:22.944 --> 02:56:25.026]  I want to talk a little bit about Giuliani here at the end.
[02:56:25.406 --> 02:56:26.767]  But government-sponsored terror.
[02:56:27.267 --> 02:56:29.408]  The Gulf of Tonkin has now been admitted to be staged.
[02:56:29.869 --> 02:56:34.812]  The Chicago Tribune has now released the NSA tapes that Israel knowingly attacked a U.S.
[02:56:34.852 --> 02:56:36.833]  ship, the USS Liberty, to try to blame it on Egypt.
[02:56:37.574 --> 02:56:42.241]  Yes, terrible things have happened in the course of history, no question about it.
[02:56:53.547 --> 02:56:57.469]  No, that's, again, crazy stuff on your part.
[02:56:58.289 --> 02:57:03.251]  I'm not a friend of Giuliani's, but he didn't bury evidence in the landfill.
[02:57:03.571 --> 02:57:18.318]  What he did was try to run a city that had been devastated by terrorism, and he made a number of mistakes, the prime one being that he didn't require the people working on the site
[02:57:19.219 --> 02:57:25.704]  Well, they didn't want to scare people, so they lied to him and said the air was good.
[02:57:25.764 --> 02:57:26.184]  That's come out.
[02:57:26.264 --> 02:57:27.886]  No, that was not Giuliani.
[02:57:27.906 --> 02:57:30.468]  That was Christina Todd Whitman.
[02:57:30.748 --> 02:57:31.228]  Exactly.
[02:57:31.248 --> 02:57:35.191]  That was Whitman, who said the air was good when it was not.
[02:57:35.512 --> 02:57:39.755]  But, you know, as I say, I'm not a friend of Giuliani's.
[02:57:39.815 --> 02:57:40.676]  I opposed him in his
[02:57:41.717 --> 02:57:48.887]  Mayor Kotz, you think it's a conspiracy that the AP reported that they use the people's bones to fill potholes in New York?
[02:57:50.949 --> 02:57:53.330]  Uh, I don't believe that that's true.
[02:57:54.271 --> 02:57:58.913]  And I have not seen that AP article, so I have to withhold judgment.
[02:57:58.973 --> 02:58:00.874]  You know what, I think you're probably a nice guy.
[02:58:00.914 --> 02:58:02.775]  I just don't think you know all the stuff we know.
[02:58:04.056 --> 02:58:12.940]  Give out your email real quick, because I want to send you... Okay, if anybody can get on my commentary list, it's one word, E-I Koch, Koch is spelled K-O-C-H,
