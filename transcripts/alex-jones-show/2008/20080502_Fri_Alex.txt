[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.460]  An external source, your MP3.
[00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:26.654]  We're going to be covering a host of issues this hour, a little bit into the next hour with Tex Mars, and Michael Hoffman, historian, former AP writer, is going to be with us for two hours.
[00:00:26.674 --> 00:00:36.480]  We're going to go into overdrive today with Mr. Hoffman, because I'm going to have Tex a little bit into the next hour, and then I'm going to spend a few minutes with the latest developments on the Deborah Jean Palfrey case.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.286]  But Tex Mars is here to talk about a host of issues, multi-time New York Times best-selling author, Air Force officer,
[00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:47.507]  Of course, space and aeronautics professor.
[00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:54.371]  He married my wife and I. And Wanda, his wife, is such a sweetheart and good family friends.
[00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:55.352]  Time flies, though.
[00:00:55.712 --> 00:00:57.653]  We used to have dinner every once in a while.
[00:00:57.673 --> 00:00:59.134]  Now we're so busy, we hardly ever see each other.
[00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:03.736]  We've got to make time to do that, but I really appreciate Tex Mars coming in the studio.
[00:01:04.377 --> 00:01:05.957]  Hey Alex, great to be with you again.
[00:01:06.618 --> 00:01:09.980]  You know, since I saw you last, it seems like
[00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.502]  The elite have ratcheted up their efforts at control of the people.
[00:01:15.182 --> 00:01:19.125]  And I'm so amazed at their ability to do that.
[00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:22.527]  And yet I believe it's because of the psychological control.
[00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:25.868]  I actually call it a magic type of alchemy.
[00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:30.551]  And I'm also delighted to see your organization here.
[00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:33.292]  Because you have people here that really care.
[00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:35.514]  And I want to say something before we begin.
[00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:37.675]  I want to mention that I knew you
[00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:40.197]  Before you were nationwide.
[00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:44.140]  And I'll never forget the first time I saw you on television, cable access.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.342]  Now, I want people to understand something, Alex.
[00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:50.525]  You volunteered to go down to Austin Cable Access.
[00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:55.847]  You became the number one program on Austin Cable Access, which was very well watched, I might add.
[00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.628]  I watched you for the first time.
[00:01:57.668 --> 00:01:59.329]  A friend mentioned this Alex Jones.
[00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.630]  You weren't getting paid a cent for this.
[00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:03.151]  You weren't in it for the money.
[00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:04.992]  If anybody believes that, that's nonsense.
[00:02:05.352 --> 00:02:06.053]  I saw you.
[00:02:06.113 --> 00:02:07.213]  Wanda was sitting by me.
[00:02:07.914 --> 00:02:11.636]  And I said, do you know why that man is going to succeed in riling up
[00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:12.997]  The establishment.
[00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:16.079]  He's exposing the evil doing in this world.
[00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.000]  And I'll tell you why he's going to succeed.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.081]  I've mentioned this to you before, but I want the audience to know.
[00:02:20.642 --> 00:02:22.383]  Three words, okay?
[00:02:23.123 --> 00:02:23.744]  Three words.
[00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:27.554]  A passion for truth.
[00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:30.376]  I guess that's four if you count the eight.
[00:02:30.496 --> 00:02:31.557]  Passion for truth.
[00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:32.838]  I saw that in you.
[00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:33.858]  Of course, there are other things.
[00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:34.679]  Intelligence.
[00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.901]  The fact that you're willing to dig in, to find out the information, the truth.
[00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:42.043]  And you're able to articulate it.
[00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:44.545]  But more than anything, the passion for truth.
[00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:45.905]  That has not left you.
[00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:48.867]  I'll tell you, I've watched, I've seen every one of your videos.
[00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:50.148]  I saw your book.
[00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:50.949]  Textures are nice.
[00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.830]  Most of the time I can't even watch my own.
[00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.352]  You know, and when you do that, though, you're going to have enemies.
[00:02:56.752 --> 00:02:57.452]  Oh, I've got plenty.
[00:02:57.553 --> 00:02:58.033]  Oh, yeah.
[00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:04.557]  Because passion for truth drives up those who want to reject the truth, who want to avoid it.
[00:03:04.937 --> 00:03:06.278]  So I thought I'd just add that.
[00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:08.959]  Well, Tex, let me just, I mean, please don't make it about me.
[00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:13.822]  I'm just an average person who's upset about what's happening, and I'm pretty obnoxious, but I've gotten a little bit better over time.
[00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:14.443]  But I have to add,
[00:03:15.003 --> 00:03:17.204]  You know, I learned more from Tex Mars than anybody else.
[00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:30.349]  I remember seeing people air your documentaries, your presentations, in like 1992-93 on Axis Television when you were just exposing the Clintons and the New World Order, and just starting to write books about that subject.
[00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:37.831]  And then Oklahoma City happened, and I saw you talking about that in 95, and that's right when I got on air.
[00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:39.252]  And of course, think how many people
[00:03:39.972 --> 00:03:44.783]  You've also woken up other than me, and think of all the other people I've woken up and all our listeners have woken up.
[00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.990]  That's what's so beautiful about this, but as you said, evil...
[00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.402]  Katie Bar The Door realizes we're breaking in on them, so they're throwing everything they've got right now.
[00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:56.683]  I mean, just overall, the whole round.
[00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:57.824]  They have no shame.
[00:03:58.284 --> 00:04:00.565]  And now they have no fear of the people.
[00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:04.788]  The only ones they fear are the listeners of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:06.309]  The very few.
[00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.392]  Because your listeners also, and I get emails from them all the time, they too have a passion for truth.
[00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:15.694]  Alex, one of the things I would really like to hit today, the main subject.
[00:04:16.554 --> 00:04:20.075]  Is something that is so amazing that's going on.
[00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:24.236]  I believe they've gone a little bit beyond the police state.
[00:04:24.536 --> 00:04:25.997]  The police state is the umbrella.
[00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:28.977]  The taking away of our constitutional rights, of course.
[00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:32.898]  And the Bill of Rights, the stripping of those rights.
[00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:38.840]  But now, they're creating, and I want the people to understand this, it is so important,
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.184]  The elite are creating a new reality.
[00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:45.346]  A new reality.
[00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:49.191]  This is a psychological battering of the public.
[00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:55.558]  Now, we've already had, of course, 9-11 and the terrorist scare, the fear-mongering.
[00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.036]  But, and this gets to people's basic needs of survival, of security, of safety.
[00:05:02.557 --> 00:05:04.339]  And they're using this against us.
[00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.502]  But wait, now they're ratcheting it up.
[00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:15.732]  Not only are they causing engendering, instilling fear for our security, our safety, but now, food.
[00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:17.633]  Water.
[00:05:18.674 --> 00:05:21.315]  Oil, which is the wellspring of our entire economy.
[00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:34.181]  These three resources, oil, water, food, they have decided to batter us into submission through these three key resources.
[00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:36.843]  Oil is everything for the economy.
[00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.345]  It means everything for people's pocketbooks.
[00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:44.551]  It means impoverishment, as the price of oil escalates and goes skyward.
[00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:45.932]  Then there's food.
[00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:48.796]  If people can't eat, they can do nothing.
[00:05:49.336 --> 00:05:55.403]  You'll remember Abraham Maslow, back in the 60s, developed this concept, which is true, it's been confirmed over and over.
[00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.370]  When people are worried, concerned, frightened over their basic needs.
[00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.990]  I'm talking about food.
[00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:03.571]  I'm talking about water.
[00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:04.571]  Okay?
[00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:07.992]  And their ability to live a decent lifestyle.
[00:06:08.552 --> 00:06:08.872]  Okay?
[00:06:09.072 --> 00:06:10.072]  Shelter and so forth.
[00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:15.834]  When those needs are not met, they don't worry about abstract things like liberty and freedom.
[00:06:16.874 --> 00:06:23.180]  They do whatever the establishment says, if they've been domesticated, so they can quote, get that standard back.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.943]  What they don't know is, this is the same elite that has engineered all this.
[00:06:26.963 --> 00:06:30.386]  And what you're saying, Tex, and I want to see you flesh this out because you wrote a book about it years ago.
[00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:55.392]  It's what the United Nations said they do in the sixties in the Club of Rome, and now they've just republished, the head of the CFR, Richard Inhofe's quote, I've been reading a lot on air, I'm sure you've seen it, where he says, we're going to have a twin rail, this is in 93, he said we're going to have terrorism, which we threaten them with to give up their rights, but then we're also going to have the global carbon tax in the name of saving the earth to regulate and bring in neo-feudalism, and he said, this is a quote,
[00:06:56.485 --> 00:07:01.267]  This makes humanity the enemy, and then we can direct the state against the enemy.
[00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:02.188]  Now that's a key.
[00:07:02.348 --> 00:07:02.908]  That's a key.
[00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:04.569]  Humanity is the enemy.
[00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.930]  You see, here's the new reality.
[00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.630]  It's a contrived hoax.
[00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.991]  Just as 9-11 was.
[00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:12.452]  Just as the Oklahoma City bombing was.
[00:07:12.772 --> 00:07:14.873]  Just as Al-Qaeda is a contrived hoax.
[00:07:15.293 --> 00:07:18.235]  Now we have a contrived hoax of resources.
[00:07:18.915 --> 00:07:20.517]  It's artificial scarcity.
[00:07:20.717 --> 00:07:21.238]  Absolutely.
[00:07:21.338 --> 00:07:25.823]  The lie is we're going into, now listen to this, an age of scarcity.
[00:07:26.524 --> 00:07:33.111]  And because of that, we all have to be good soldiers and agree to share with the rest of the world.
[00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:41.234]  We have to share our water, we have to share our food, and we have to also... But we're not going to share with the people.
[00:07:41.634 --> 00:07:44.315]  There's a middle man called the New World Order.
[00:07:44.495 --> 00:07:45.235]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:45.475 --> 00:07:47.176]  Well, they're getting enriched by all this.
[00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:52.437]  And if the price of gasoline at the pump goes to $10 a gallon, quit your bellyaching, man!
[00:07:52.457 --> 00:07:55.938]  I mean, we're doing you a favor, even letting you drive a car!
[00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:57.859]  I mean, we're helping you!
[00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:00.860]  You don't really deserve this.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.501]  I mean, there's a scarcity of oil.
[00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:03.822]  And it's because of peak oil.
[00:08:04.222 --> 00:08:13.908]  And then they can also blame Alaska and point at a few hippies they finance as NGOs, when we've had all the oil company executives on more oil than Saudi Arabia, and the government isn't going to let it out of the ground.
[00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:16.590]  Oh, but hippies are stopping them from getting it.
[00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.712]  Well, yeah, we haven't had a, for example, in the oil area, we haven't had a new refinery built.
[00:08:21.793 --> 00:08:23.075]  Since the 1970s.
[00:08:23.435 --> 00:08:25.497]  They blame it on the environmental movement, but wait!
[00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:33.927]  Who actually funded, who actually founded and sponsor, today, these environmental organizations?
[00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:34.447]  Shell companies.
[00:08:34.468 --> 00:08:34.948]  Sierra.
[00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:36.430]  Nature Conservancy.
[00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.551]  Sure, the massive
[00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:39.892]  Most of their money doesn't come from the unwashed hippies.
[00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:40.733]  Rockefeller's founded it.
[00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:41.593]  Absolutely.
[00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:55.740]  And we got the old company documents in 2001, Associated Press did, where they said in 95, in a consortium meeting, the Big Ten, they said, Exxon, Mobil, all of them, before they merged, they said, we're going to buy up these 214 refineries and shut them down to create an artificial bottleneck.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.802]  Yeah, these are artificial hoaxes.
[00:08:59.282 --> 00:09:01.463]  Now, then they have the media to control this.
[00:09:01.523 --> 00:09:03.464]  And then comes the idea of peak oil.
[00:09:03.724 --> 00:09:05.145]  Now, you know I come from East Texas.
[00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:09.346]  My brother was a high-level executive in Sun Oil Company.
[00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:11.387]  And he used to sit around with me.
[00:09:11.427 --> 00:09:12.327]  We used to talk about this.
[00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:15.428]  Listen, back in Port Natchez, Texas... So was my grandmother's dad.
[00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:15.768]  Is that right?
[00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:17.269]  Yeah, my great-grandpa worked for Sun Oil.
[00:09:17.369 --> 00:09:26.472]  And back in the 70s, you know, when we had the first big energy crisis with Nixon in office, and there were lines at the gas pump, the service stations, miles long.
[00:09:27.112 --> 00:09:33.317]  My brother was just shocked about this, because remember he was with Sun Oil, he was able to see the figures of what their inventories were.
[00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:36.240]  He says, the United States is brimming with oil.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.442]  There's no cutoff from the Middle East, brimming with oil.
[00:09:39.843 --> 00:09:47.068]  And the tankers continued to come in, but it wasn't being refined, because they had decided it's time to drive up the price.
[00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:53.033]  Now we know that Kissinger agreed with the Shah of Iran and others to allow the price of oil to escalate.
[00:09:53.053 --> 00:09:53.734]  That's now public.
[00:09:53.914 --> 00:09:56.156]  And now we're seeing the same thing now.
[00:09:56.176 --> 00:09:57.918]  Called the conspiracy theory in the seventies.
[00:09:58.298 --> 00:09:58.498]  Yeah.
[00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:00.960]  And here's an interesting thing too.
[00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:05.064]  Even at this time, thirty years ago, my brother told me something interesting.
[00:10:05.505 --> 00:10:12.291]  He said the oil fields, the oil wells that we first drilled and thought we'd brought all the oil out of the ground from,
[00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:15.944]  And then we capped them, you know, they put all the concrete and closed them back up.
[00:10:16.404 --> 00:10:24.306]  We're going, it's Sun Oil, I'm sure this is true of every oil company, we're going back now 20-30 years later, uncapping them, and guess what?
[00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:25.826]  We find they're full of oil again!
[00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:27.327]  It just comes back.
[00:10:27.547 --> 00:10:30.828]  It replenishes, it percolates up from the earth, there's processes going on under earth.
[00:10:30.848 --> 00:10:34.669]  And there's hundreds of top universities approving that it is not dead dinosaurs.
[00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:36.270]  No, no, that's silly.
[00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.710]  Fossils.
[00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.431]  Again, again, more fraud.
[00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.131]  Fossil oil.
[00:10:39.411 --> 00:10:40.631]  Yeah, that's sort of silly stuff.
[00:10:40.832 --> 00:10:44.873]  I think this all came about at the turn of the century.
[00:10:44.913 --> 00:10:51.236]  You know, Rockefeller, with the Standard Oil Company, had a monopoly that was broken up, supposedly, by the U.S.
[00:10:51.256 --> 00:10:51.876]  Supreme Court.
[00:10:51.896 --> 00:10:59.440]  But 1906, and it was just in the news the other day, they came back and they admitted the family owns the company, and they're about to fire Rex Tillerson because he won't go along with global warming.
[00:11:00.123 --> 00:11:03.084]  Well, of course, global warming is another scam that they have.
[00:11:03.824 --> 00:11:07.845]  Now, back to this fossil fuel, so-called.
[00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:09.226]  You know, the very idea of it.
[00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:13.827]  Hey, oil is dead dinosaurs that have decomposed in the earth.
[00:11:13.867 --> 00:11:14.508]  That's our oil.
[00:11:14.728 --> 00:11:17.048]  When you run out of dead dinosaurs, you run out of oil.
[00:11:17.088 --> 00:11:17.749]  That's the claim.
[00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:19.929]  It's so silly, people don't really think about it.
[00:11:20.189 --> 00:11:21.150]  Here's where this came up.
[00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.751]  Around the Los Angeles area, they had the oil tar pits.
[00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:33.056]  And of course, being gooey and sticky, there were a certain number of animals, even back in prehistoric times, that got into the oil tar pit and guess what?
[00:11:33.377 --> 00:11:34.878]  They couldn't get out and they died there.
[00:11:35.098 --> 00:11:36.139]  They found their remains.
[00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:39.861]  This caused many people to say, hey, that must be where the oil came from.
[00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:40.321]  Exactly.
[00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:41.362]  Uneducated people.
[00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:42.143]  Stay there.
[00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:42.963]  Text MARS.
[00:11:42.983 --> 00:11:45.985]  We're going to be right back after break for presentplanet.tv viewers.
[00:11:46.005 --> 00:11:47.987]  We're going to have some behind the scenes right now.
[00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:52.878]  Tex, we've got four minutes in this break and I don't want to waste any of this time.
[00:11:52.918 --> 00:11:55.361]  Let's come back to the Tar Pits on the other side with folks.
[00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:59.526]  But this will be on the web and is on the web right now live, but archived on the web forever.
[00:12:00.607 --> 00:12:05.714]  Before we go any further, on other subjects, what do you think about Deborah Jean Palfrey?
[00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:06.435]  You know, we interviewed her.
[00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:06.935]  Okay.
[00:12:06.955 --> 00:12:08.375]  She said, I'll never commit suicide.
[00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.876]  If they say I do, it's not true.
[00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:15.977]  Then they have this weird government debunker who comes out and says JFK, RFK, the official story's true.
[00:12:16.297 --> 00:12:17.677]  Vince Foster wasn't suicided.
[00:12:17.977 --> 00:12:22.198]  He says she just called him up and said, I'm going to kill myself.
[00:12:22.718 --> 00:12:23.219]  No tape!
[00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:24.739]  We have a tape from a month and a half ago.
[00:12:24.839 --> 00:12:26.099]  It wasn't Posner, was it?
[00:12:26.419 --> 00:12:27.299]  No, no, it's another one of them.
[00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:27.640]  Another one.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:27.920]  Okay.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.320]  Alright.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.200]  I haven't heard this morning's news.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.561]  But quite obvious, the gal is a very confident person.
[00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:38.163]  She may have spent a little prison time, or may have had to, but she wasn't going to kill herself.
[00:12:38.244 --> 00:12:41.305]  You can look at the person and see the personality type does not kill themselves.
[00:12:41.325 --> 00:12:41.926]  Tough as nails.
[00:12:42.126 --> 00:12:43.327]  Tough as nails.
[00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:44.427]  Absolutely.
[00:12:45.048 --> 00:12:47.629]  Here's a gal that ran a pretty shrewd operation.
[00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.853]  I'm not talking about the morality of it, I'm talking about the organizational skills and management.
[00:12:52.913 --> 00:12:52.973]  No.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.461]  No, so, yeah, we can talk about that.
[00:12:55.581 --> 00:12:56.802]  There's no way she killed herself.
[00:12:57.002 --> 00:12:58.283]  Well, let's spend a few minutes on that right now.
[00:12:58.303 --> 00:12:59.143]  What's your take on it?
[00:13:00.124 --> 00:13:00.984]  Are we on air?
[00:13:01.465 --> 00:13:06.248]  Yeah, well, see what I do is I do the main radio show, and now because we're doing this as a webcast, we just go into overdrive here.
[00:13:06.268 --> 00:13:07.348]  Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
[00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:08.169]  I like it even more.
[00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:08.629]  Okay.
[00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.051]  Well, my take on this is, frankly, that there were names.
[00:13:12.592 --> 00:13:15.594]  You remember that the court ordered those names to be sealed.
[00:13:16.334 --> 00:13:28.701]  But here's a gal who once went on to prison, and I'm sure her lawyer says shut up now, but once she did her little prison term of six months or nine months or whatever, she was denuded of her money, right?
[00:13:29.061 --> 00:13:29.922]  She needs to make money.
[00:13:29.962 --> 00:13:34.264]  She's going to write a tell-all book.
[00:13:34.284 --> 00:13:34.965]  She was planning a book.
[00:13:35.165 --> 00:13:37.566]  Yeah, and maybe do a little prison time.
[00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:42.247]  Once she gets out, she gets a ghostwriter, does a tell-all book, and she becomes a millionaire!
[00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.687]  Why doesn't she want to kill herself?
[00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:46.748]  She was in the business of prostitution to make money.
[00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:48.508]  I didn't think of that.
[00:13:48.568 --> 00:13:50.188]  She had a big future ahead of her.
[00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:56.750]  I mean, I thought about him killing her for the book she was planning to do, which was admitted, but I didn't think of the fact that that's even more of a reason not to commit suicide.
[00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:03.897]  Harper and Roe, Simon and Schuster are slobbering at the mouth to get this gal to write a book on this.
[00:14:04.298 --> 00:14:08.843]  And of course, the bigwigs, the elite, and who knows the names, congressmen, senators?
[00:14:08.904 --> 00:14:09.484]  Well, the M.O.
[00:14:09.544 --> 00:14:13.109]  is it's Cheney and McCain.
[00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:14.150]  They're perverted.
[00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:15.992]  They're the few that actually like women.
[00:14:16.032 --> 00:14:16.833]  We know it's mainly a...
[00:14:18.735 --> 00:14:21.716]  I shouldn't say this, but even look at Cheney's wife, Lynne Cheney.
[00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:23.677]  She wrote a lesbian sex novel.
[00:14:23.717 --> 00:14:27.038]  Maybe she was being serviced by these prostitutes.
[00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:28.939]  It might have been a family thing with the Cheneys.
[00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.200]  Horrible there.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:35.182]  But the poor lady, you look at her, you know she's not the psychological type.
[00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:42.444]  You know, I don't want to say I know everything about psychology, but I did teach abnormal psychology and adult psychology at University of Illinois.
[00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:43.825]  Well, she told me she was never going to do it.
[00:14:43.865 --> 00:14:44.405]  So I can tell.
[00:14:44.485 --> 00:14:46.926]  She's no crazy person who's going to kill herself.
[00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:52.748]  She may be an immoral person, but even more the reason why she was looking forward to enriching herself.
[00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:58.910]  She had a gold mine here, just like the little gal did, that was exposed to the prostitute for Eliot Spitzer.
[00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:17.935]  Well, then on top of it, we also have, how this all started, the Brittany Britton, which was this, getting her PhD, but she was also already a professor, and she magically hangs herself when she was facing six months in jail for a prostitution bust, but she shot her mouth off.
[00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:19.275]  She said, this is hypocritical.
[00:15:19.555 --> 00:15:26.457]  She said, I'm going to name names, boom, hangs herself, and then that's when they go bust her to bring her into the system and discredit her, her boss Palfrey.
[00:15:26.937 --> 00:15:27.577]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[00:15:27.597 --> 00:15:28.898]  And then now she hangs herself.
[00:15:29.758 --> 00:15:34.460]  And this guy, a totally disreputable source in my opinion, says, oh, she called me.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.080]  She told me.
[00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:36.321]  She was going to do it.
[00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:37.121]  But we have the tape.
[00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:37.541]  He doesn't.
[00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:45.965]  Well, he doesn't have a tape, but even if he did, the ability to manufacture voice through voice synthesization is so incredible today.
[00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:49.666]  Dan Moldea, and I mean, this guy pops up on everything.
[00:15:50.186 --> 00:15:51.267]  Just everywhere.
[00:15:51.687 --> 00:15:53.408]  Okay, we're going to go back on the network right now.
[00:15:53.448 --> 00:15:53.728]  Here we go.
[00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:59.954]  Welcome back, Genesis listeners.
[00:16:00.194 --> 00:16:02.096]  Say hi to all the presentPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:16:02.977 --> 00:16:05.740]  We have Tex Mars here in studio with us.
[00:16:07.002 --> 00:16:08.844]  Going back into oil.
[00:16:09.464 --> 00:16:11.126]  Shifting gears back into that.
[00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:12.688]  Yeah, they came out with
[00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:12.788]  Yes.
[00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:46.013]  Well, first of all, we need to understand something.
[00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:47.115]  We're being attacked.
[00:16:47.856 --> 00:16:49.158]  Our minds are being attacked.
[00:16:49.398 --> 00:16:52.463]  We're being told to accept a new reality.
[00:16:52.723 --> 00:16:56.128]  That we're going to have to accept being a third world impoverished nation.
[00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:58.351]  That we're going to have to accept
[00:16:58.832 --> 00:17:00.473]  Food prices doubling, tripling.
[00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:04.296]  We're going to have to accept the fact that our water is going to be controlled from now on.
[00:17:04.696 --> 00:17:07.018]  And the price of that is going to go up dramatically.
[00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:11.922]  This age of scarcity, this new reality, this is what we have to watch out for.
[00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:13.623]  Now, how do we fight back?
[00:17:14.904 --> 00:17:21.048]  First of all, we have to understand the truth, which is, for 200 years, America has been the land of plenty.
[00:17:21.628 --> 00:17:22.729]  And we have plenty.
[00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:25.931]  This planet is awash with oil.
[00:17:26.551 --> 00:17:32.295]  Once we understand that, once we understand that water is incredible, most of the world's surface has water.
[00:17:32.335 --> 00:17:33.916]  They're now saying water isn't renewable.
[00:17:34.076 --> 00:17:35.357]  They're teaching school children that.
[00:17:35.757 --> 00:17:38.458]  Well, and the reason why, let's go back to the water.
[00:17:38.478 --> 00:17:43.259]  We'll go around and round up all these three key resources in the so-called age of scarcity.
[00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:47.659]  Remember, billionaires like T. Boone Pickens from Oklahoma.
[00:17:47.979 --> 00:17:53.601]  He has bought up the water rights in West Texas for about three states, underground the water rights.
[00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:56.281]  He's going to build pipelines, just like oil pipelines.
[00:17:56.861 --> 00:17:59.902]  And water is going to cost more than oil within a decade.
[00:17:59.922 --> 00:18:00.642]  That's their plan.
[00:18:01.063 --> 00:18:01.484]  The U.N.
[00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:03.048]  has said it 30 years ago.
[00:18:03.068 --> 00:18:08.001]  Again, a key point here for everybody to understand to totally back up what you're saying, Tex.
[00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:14.483]  I remember not just reading Club of Rome documents and all of this, because they go back 40 years, 30 years before they had met all of this.
[00:18:15.104 --> 00:18:21.769]  I remember on NPR and on PBS shows and Charlie Rose, they would say, the New World Order will be built on shortage.
[00:18:22.069 --> 00:18:23.190]  You know, when you have Kissinger on.
[00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.493]  We've built on oil, water, timber, everything.
[00:18:26.513 --> 00:18:36.441]  And of course they get to tax us now on what humans put off, carbon dioxide, saying it's a deadly poison, when it's one of the four, you know, life-giving building blocks, water, sun, carbon dioxide, oxygen.
[00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:37.762]  On this planet.
[00:18:38.422 --> 00:18:41.664]  But I've heard them on NPR go, Americans are soon going to have our standard of living taken.
[00:18:41.904 --> 00:18:42.704]  We deserve it.
[00:18:42.724 --> 00:18:44.345]  It's like a little liberal sacrament.
[00:18:44.705 --> 00:18:45.846]  Oh, we're going to pay now.
[00:18:46.126 --> 00:18:47.427]  They admit it's a scam!
[00:18:47.607 --> 00:18:49.648]  I mean, they are just... Go ahead, Tex.
[00:18:50.248 --> 00:18:51.829]  Well, back to this water.
[00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:53.730]  Not only T. Boone Pickens, there are many more.
[00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.931]  For example, Maury Strong.
[00:18:54.951 --> 00:18:55.691]  He's a Canadian.
[00:18:55.992 --> 00:18:58.673]  But he comes down to Colorado with his wife, Hannah.
[00:18:58.853 --> 00:19:01.655]  The first thing he does, this rich Illuminati
[00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:03.896]  He's admittedly into the occult.
[00:19:03.916 --> 00:19:04.757]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:19:04.897 --> 00:19:07.939]  Well, he builds a temple to the occult.
[00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:12.181]  A New Age temple there in the Baca Grande area of Colorado.
[00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:15.403]  Remember now, he's a rich, fabulously rich Canadian.
[00:19:15.623 --> 00:19:16.884]  But there he is in Colorado.
[00:19:16.944 --> 00:19:17.245]  Why?
[00:19:17.705 --> 00:19:21.908]  Because he bought up, for a song, the water rites
[00:19:22.788 --> 00:19:27.532]  To Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, because of this Baca Grande.
[00:19:27.872 --> 00:19:29.393]  Trillions of barrels of water in the ground.
[00:19:29.413 --> 00:19:32.395]  And by the way, governments aren't allowed to sell the aquifers, but they do.
[00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:33.336]  Oh, oh yeah.
[00:19:33.376 --> 00:19:34.397]  Now, strong, strong.
[00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:37.499]  And that's why they're now saying, you can't drill a well, you can't have your own water.
[00:19:37.519 --> 00:19:37.759]  Go ahead.
[00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:38.540]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.480]  They're going to control us.
[00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:40.641]  And they're going to watch.
[00:19:40.922 --> 00:19:42.883]  People that now have wells loaded on the country.
[00:19:42.903 --> 00:19:43.884]  There's 2 million cops.
[00:19:43.904 --> 00:19:44.664]  They're going to be metered.
[00:19:44.824 --> 00:19:48.707]  They're talking about 3 million enviro-cops, without warrants, just everywhere spying.
[00:19:48.727 --> 00:19:48.987]  Go ahead.
[00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:50.689]  Well, the satellites are watching too.
[00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:52.510]  Yeah, that's what they're using.
[00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.672]  They're using the military satellites.
[00:19:54.692 --> 00:19:56.673]  Don't blow your own well, they'll be watching.
[00:19:56.694 --> 00:19:57.854]  No, no, they admit it now.
[00:19:57.914 --> 00:19:59.256]  Local police are going to have it too.
[00:19:59.876 --> 00:20:09.524]  Now, the interesting thing about Maurice Strong, for example, and I talk about him quite a bit in my book, Circle of Intrigue, the hidden inner circle of the global Illuminati conspiracy.
[00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:19.211]  Strong was the head, at the time, when he bought up these water rights here in the United States, head of the United Nations Environmental Program.
[00:20:20.112 --> 00:20:24.315]  Then he went back up to Canada and he bought into Hydro Canada.
[00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:28.017]  Now he owns most of the water rights of the Canadian people.
[00:20:28.438 --> 00:20:41.486]  Now, the reason why they did this, why they bought up all these water rights, all these aquifers very slowly, very quietly over the last two decades, they are now going to drive up the price of water to unbelievable levels.
[00:20:41.946 --> 00:20:44.128]  It's going to be such a precious resource.
[00:20:44.848 --> 00:20:46.810]  And they're going to watch every little drop.
[00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.250]  Forget about your lawns.
[00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:49.852]  Forget about your home gardens.
[00:20:50.212 --> 00:20:53.954]  And people who live out in the country that have their own wells, they're going to have to put meters on them.
[00:20:54.134 --> 00:20:55.435]  They're going to watch everything.
[00:20:55.495 --> 00:20:56.436]  And this is feudalism.
[00:20:56.476 --> 00:20:57.337]  And privatization.
[00:20:57.617 --> 00:21:02.780]  And all of the municipal water companies have been forced to sell their operations to the rich.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.782]  Has anybody wondered why it's Dutch, German, British, Israeli?
[00:21:05.822 --> 00:21:07.383]  They own all the water districts now.
[00:21:07.403 --> 00:21:07.964]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:21:08.084 --> 00:21:09.465]  And in fact, I get the reports all the time.
[00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:14.228]  They'll come in and buy the city's water, pay off the politicians, and then double, triple prices overnight.
[00:21:14.868 --> 00:21:16.689]  Now, the food industry is exactly the same.
[00:21:16.709 --> 00:21:18.869]  We're going to come back and talk about that with Tex Mars.
[00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:26.912]  And then during this break, for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers or for InfoWars.com internet stream listeners, we're going to go ahead and switch over to that stream right now, folks.
[00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:31.773]  You'll be able to hear me and Tex at the InfoWars stream and continue this discussion to all our MNF affiliates.
[00:21:32.013 --> 00:21:35.874]  We'll be right back in three minutes for all of you that are out there.
[00:21:36.114 --> 00:21:37.575]  We're trying to stop the New World Order.
[00:21:39.082 --> 00:21:44.748]  Okay, Tex, we've got three minutes here, and I want to get more into Palfrey and what's happening.
[00:21:45.048 --> 00:21:48.672]  We're having two discussions here, parallel, called the Schizophrenic Radio Show.
[00:21:49.253 --> 00:21:59.244]  But a lot of people are pointing out that this was the High Holy Day, May 1st, yesterday, and that murders always go up then, kidnappings go up in the week before.
[00:21:59.904 --> 00:22:02.427]  And that they always kill D.C.
[00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:09.253]  Pages, and they always have weird murders and weird things that happen on that day, and they like to wait until that day.
[00:22:09.754 --> 00:22:10.955]  Have you found any truth to this?
[00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:11.696]  Of course.
[00:22:12.536 --> 00:22:16.800]  The ancient pagans, okay, which all this is based on, this Illuminism is based on,
[00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:18.962]  worshipped on May Day.
[00:22:19.002 --> 00:22:23.305]  They had their great orgies to Bacchus and Dionysius.
[00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:33.933]  Now, these May Day celebrations, all right, May the 1st, you'll recall that Adam Weishaupt, who founded the Order of the Illuminati, founded it on May 1, 1776.
[00:22:36.135 --> 00:22:36.535]  May 1.
[00:22:37.075 --> 00:22:43.000]  The Communist Revolution, Lenin and Trotsky, they took over the Soviet Union in November
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:51.867]  But when did they have their big celebrations annually with all of the tanks and the rockets going down Red Square there in Moscow?
[00:22:52.127 --> 00:22:52.668]  May 1!
[00:22:52.928 --> 00:23:02.096]  You can have Communists, you can have Google, you can have Republicans, you can have... They all celebrate May Day, and the dumbed-down public doesn't know this is the highest holy day.
[00:23:02.516 --> 00:23:06.420]  They call it International Solidarity Day, you know, among the unions and others.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.823]  And of course, May Day is actually a satanic festival.
[00:23:11.124 --> 00:23:15.348]  Remember, they would also have the maypoles they would put up, and have all the kids parade around.
[00:23:15.368 --> 00:23:20.492]  Then they would have their orgies out in the forest and so forth, worshiping Pan, the horned god of the forest.
[00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:23.995]  Now, let's, you know, move right up to today.
[00:23:24.376 --> 00:23:29.820]  We have the same celebrations of May Day going around the world, May Day.
[00:23:30.521 --> 00:23:37.950]  Okay, in England, and France, and Italy, and among the Illuminati, among the Freemasons, this is a key day.
[00:23:38.191 --> 00:23:39.853]  This is bigger than Samhain.
[00:23:40.253 --> 00:23:44.578]  That's why they have the Mexican illegal immigrants all go out on May Day, May 1st.
[00:23:44.618 --> 00:23:46.501]  There's communists, but that's only one facet.
[00:23:46.801 --> 00:23:48.383]  Yeah, and of course, all of that is organized.
[00:23:48.423 --> 00:23:49.704]  They don't go out spontaneously.
[00:23:49.744 --> 00:23:53.327]  Rob Allen and Co., the big Republican deal that admitted funded all of this.
[00:23:53.487 --> 00:23:53.748]  Yeah.
[00:23:54.248 --> 00:24:01.415]  So, yeah, May Day, I can see this incredible... We have Valparaiso Night, the Satanic Festival.
[00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:07.280]  April, of course, is a big month, and everything goes to a crescendo for May Day.
[00:24:07.921 --> 00:24:09.162]  And remember what this is.
[00:24:09.703 --> 00:24:11.785]  They're now forcing the harvest.
[00:24:11.865 --> 00:24:12.666]  That's what they believe.
[00:24:12.927 --> 00:24:15.469]  Through human sacrifice, they're forcing the harvest.
[00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:16.851]  The spring has come.
[00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:18.953]  The gods look upon us favorable.
[00:24:19.214 --> 00:24:21.116]  And now the sun is returning.
[00:24:21.516 --> 00:24:23.338]  And now it's possible to have the harvest.
[00:24:23.558 --> 00:24:25.561]  Of course, to you and I, this sounds ridiculous.
[00:24:26.281 --> 00:24:28.542]  You know, all of these things, but not to them.
[00:24:28.882 --> 00:24:33.244]  It doesn't matter whether we think it's crazy, whether it's insane, we know it is.
[00:24:33.684 --> 00:24:38.527]  But listen, there are millions of people that believe in these things, and there's a small core.
[00:24:39.027 --> 00:24:45.670]  Five to six thousand Illuminati, and of course, you know, those that are really in the know go into only the few hundred.
[00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:48.151]  Stay there, and there in the next break we'll go back into that.
[00:25:01.328 --> 00:25:02.869]  We're having two parallel discussions.
[00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:07.592]  During the break, we're talking about why did they kill Paul III on May Day, the high, holy occult day.
[00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:12.435]  And then it got into environmentalism and how they believe it's earth worship, sun worship.
[00:25:12.716 --> 00:25:21.762]  And then now we see that topic, because it's all interconnected, nexusing with how they want to control the resources through feudalism because they, quote, worship the earth.
[00:25:22.002 --> 00:25:28.226]  But then they're the ones actually destroying the earth because they believe in this yin and yang, the Illuminati Code, that they destroy and they rebuild.
[00:25:29.067 --> 00:25:31.288]  But in their own stated documents, it's official.
[00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:41.058]  They say that they're going to take the water, the food, the land, the oil, jack up the prices to bring you all back to a feudal level so you can't afford to have children.
[00:25:41.518 --> 00:25:45.582]  And as I told you they would do, they've now proposed one-child taxes in the U.S.
[00:25:45.983 --> 00:25:51.708]  as it started in China and then seven years later it started in the mid-70s and then in the early 80s became mandatory.
[00:25:52.749 --> 00:25:54.370]  They signed IMF World Bank deals.
[00:25:54.671 --> 00:25:56.632]  They signed on a State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:25:57.413 --> 00:25:58.393]  This is all coming.
[00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:00.375]  You think it's bad now with a cop on every corner?
[00:26:00.715 --> 00:26:07.400]  New environmental regulations, animal ID, premise society, thousands of dollars in fines for tiny things, total control.
[00:26:08.261 --> 00:26:11.463]  They're flattening tires, burning down buildings now, the fake environmentalists.
[00:26:12.164 --> 00:26:13.324]  Soon they're going to be in uniforms.
[00:26:13.344 --> 00:26:13.985]  They already are.
[00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:17.648]  Al Gore, 10 million strong, youth army in the US.
[00:26:18.268 --> 00:26:19.209]  Tex, please continue.
[00:26:19.809 --> 00:26:20.290]  Well, you know,
[00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.952]  Several years ago, I wrote this book, Days of Hunger, Days of Chaos.
[00:26:23.992 --> 00:26:31.516]  I want you to have a copy of it, Alex, because in this book, the subtitle, by the way, is The Coming Great Food Shortages in America.
[00:26:31.996 --> 00:26:33.597]  And a lot of people said, hey, this can't be.
[00:26:34.117 --> 00:26:35.878]  You know, I don't believe this kind of stuff.
[00:26:36.138 --> 00:26:38.379]  But here's a book, over 200 pages that I wrote.
[00:26:38.719 --> 00:26:39.720]  This was the first book
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:47.604]  To expose Monsanto, Dow Chemical and the others, their plans for the Terminator gene to be implanted in the seeds.
[00:26:47.624 --> 00:26:48.184]  You wrote this.
[00:26:48.204 --> 00:26:49.785]  You wrote this nine years ago, I remember.
[00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:50.605]  Absolutely.
[00:26:50.785 --> 00:26:51.826]  And people couldn't believe it.
[00:26:51.866 --> 00:26:54.987]  They couldn't believe that the Terminator seeds would be used by piromids.
[00:26:55.007 --> 00:26:58.229]  But you saw their own documents and you knew that they planned to create this artificial.
[00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.449]  Go ahead.
[00:26:58.469 --> 00:26:59.089]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:26:59.329 --> 00:27:00.310]  Now, think of this.
[00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.211]  Maria Bertini, I quote her in the book.
[00:27:03.231 --> 00:27:04.292]  Who is Maria Bertini?
[00:27:04.732 --> 00:27:09.714]  She was the head of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
[00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.535]  There is a World Food Authority.
[00:27:11.776 --> 00:27:14.357]  They've already set it up, okay, at the United Nations.
[00:27:14.657 --> 00:27:19.880]  In fact, they have erected a building, a gigantic complex, in Brussels, Belgium.
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.381]  All right?
[00:27:21.901 --> 00:27:23.802]  My next newsletter, I'm going to have a picture of that building.
[00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:27.565]  Hey, it seems to be ten times as big as the United States Capitol.
[00:27:27.965 --> 00:27:30.006]  It must have thousands of bureaucrats.
[00:27:30.387 --> 00:27:31.407]  They are ready to go.
[00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:35.270]  They're going to control the world's food, including America's food.
[00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:39.232]  They had that Beijing conference, 96, 97, which one?
[00:27:39.293 --> 00:27:44.996]  And the head of the UN Food Program said, we will use food as a weapon, we have used it as a weapon, and we do not apologize.
[00:27:45.036 --> 00:27:45.877]  That was Bertini.
[00:27:46.277 --> 00:27:50.360]  And she said, and I want to quote her, food is power.
[00:27:51.401 --> 00:27:52.963]  Food is power.
[00:27:53.223 --> 00:28:03.854]  The head of the United Nations Food Program, with this gigantic building, they probably employ three or four thousand bureaucrats in this one building in Brussels, Belgium, for food.
[00:28:04.094 --> 00:28:09.140]  And remember also, the United Nations last year had an international water conference.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:10.581]  They're warning people.
[00:28:10.601 --> 00:28:14.164]  There are going to be wars between nations over water.
[00:28:14.724 --> 00:28:16.486]  Already we're seeing food riots.
[00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:21.990]  Everything is taking place so that they can program our minds.
[00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.514]  This is alchemical attacks, alchemical magic attacks on the brain.
[00:28:26.534 --> 00:28:33.559]  We're being taught that food and water and fuel now are these incredibly scarce commodities.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:34.200]  That's right.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.061]  But don't worry, government's going to help us.
[00:28:36.482 --> 00:28:37.122]  One child.
[00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:37.583]  Oh yeah.
[00:28:38.203 --> 00:28:44.505]  Less people, as Ted Turner's been saying, there are suddenly all of a sudden, if we had less people, you could have the Mercedes again.
[00:28:45.185 --> 00:28:59.429]  Well, isn't it interesting that Ted Turner, who, you know, the guy that once called Christians losers and bozos, Ted Turner, who's been favored by the Illuminati rich all his life, he says, we must all have no more than one child.
[00:28:59.609 --> 00:29:00.129]  He has five.
[00:29:00.209 --> 00:29:02.490]  I'm glad you mentioned that!
[00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:03.570]  He has five!
[00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:04.531]  Himself!
[00:29:06.952 --> 00:29:08.634]  All of this is a setup, of course.
[00:29:09.074 --> 00:29:12.857]  This zero population growth, which by the way, George Bush Sr.
[00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:13.758]  used to be the head of it.
[00:29:14.058 --> 00:29:19.203]  Rockefeller made him the head of the zero population growth organization years ago.
[00:29:20.604 --> 00:29:24.747]  So, we have an attack on human beings, as you mentioned earlier, Alex.
[00:29:25.468 --> 00:29:29.912]  And these three key resources, I want to bring something to people's minds.
[00:29:30.673 --> 00:29:32.814]  If they're attacking our minds, what do we do?
[00:29:33.695 --> 00:29:34.256]  To recover.
[00:29:34.576 --> 00:29:35.336]  What do we do?
[00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:37.118]  Of course we tell the truth, but listen to this.
[00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:47.186]  Rather than going into this mindset, this programmed magical trance, that there is an age of scarcity, we need to strike back.
[00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:48.927]  And let me tell you how we can do it.
[00:29:49.347 --> 00:29:51.969]  We need to bring up proof, just as you and others did with 9-11.
[00:29:53.323 --> 00:29:57.385]  What you did, Alex, you said, we will not accept the establishment version of event.
[00:29:57.746 --> 00:29:58.006]  Why?
[00:29:58.366 --> 00:30:00.567]  Because it doesn't correlate with the truth.
[00:30:01.288 --> 00:30:07.031]  And then you and a few others begin to bring this incredible array of truth to the fore.
[00:30:07.711 --> 00:30:11.073]  Books, videos by you and others, radio programs.
[00:30:11.493 --> 00:30:16.116]  You have been smashing the 9-11, the establishment version, the lie.
[00:30:16.496 --> 00:30:17.697]  Now they've got the lie about
[00:30:18.417 --> 00:30:22.159]  Oil shortages, oil scarcity, water scarcity, food scarcity.
[00:30:22.179 --> 00:30:25.220]  But as I said, Richard N. Haas at the CFR, we can use his own quote.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.801]  He said, these are made up.
[00:30:26.861 --> 00:30:27.401]  He says it.
[00:30:27.801 --> 00:30:34.024]  But we're going to have terror on one part, and then we're going to have the environment on the other for scarcity to wage war on the people.
[00:30:34.224 --> 00:30:40.247]  And they say because when we have too much resources, we have time on our hands, we have liberty, we can politically get involved.
[00:30:40.267 --> 00:30:40.587]  There you go.
[00:30:40.607 --> 00:30:42.048]  We go back to the basic needs.
[00:30:42.568 --> 00:30:46.930]  Once the basic needs are met, people look for higher, abstract things.
[00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.511]  Self-actualization.
[00:30:48.571 --> 00:30:51.173]  That's the hierarchy of needs.
[00:30:51.873 --> 00:30:54.775]  And people then say, wow, we want liberty, we want freedom.
[00:30:54.995 --> 00:31:08.624]  But they're willing to give up their liberty and freedom if they need to eat, if they're thirsty, if they're worried about how they're going to afford a home for their family because of the oil prices going up and smashing the economy.
[00:31:08.844 --> 00:31:09.665]  What we need to do
[00:31:10.305 --> 00:31:11.987]  Is show that these are lies.
[00:31:12.027 --> 00:31:13.408]  There is no age of scarcity.
[00:31:13.768 --> 00:31:17.612]  The world is awash in petroleum.
[00:31:17.772 --> 00:31:18.633]  It's a cornucopia.
[00:31:18.853 --> 00:31:19.634]  And I want to prove that.
[00:31:19.674 --> 00:31:21.475]  I've got just some news items.
[00:31:21.555 --> 00:31:28.682]  If we just do basic research, we're going to find there's oil coming out of the world's ears.
[00:31:29.022 --> 00:31:30.283]  This is planet petroleum.
[00:31:30.303 --> 00:31:30.824]  I want to be clear.
[00:31:30.904 --> 00:31:35.047]  I have family, I don't myself, that has some nice oil in Texas, in East Texas.
[00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:39.933]  You know, they don't like all the lies, even though it's making them make more money.
[00:31:40.313 --> 00:31:49.725]  I mean, I'm telling you as somebody whose family's worked as a petroleum geologist, worked in oil companies, worked as plant heads, worked as roughnecks, the whole leasehounds, you know, we're Texans.
[00:31:50.286 --> 00:31:51.067]  Are your families in it?
[00:31:51.127 --> 00:31:51.407]  I'm in it.
[00:31:52.308 --> 00:31:55.352]  And, you know, in East Texas, where my family's from, almost everybody's got an oil well.
[00:31:56.292 --> 00:31:57.393]  Call it mailbox money.
[00:31:57.633 --> 00:32:01.594]  Well, we wake up in the morning and we smell oil where I came from in Portland, Texas.
[00:32:01.654 --> 00:32:04.775]  Exactly, but the point is, is that everywhere they drill, it comes.
[00:32:04.815 --> 00:32:06.975]  I mean, just shooting out natural gas, helium.
[00:32:07.015 --> 00:32:11.837]  And the people's backyards, in some places around Kilgore and other places in Texas.
[00:32:11.857 --> 00:32:17.538]  It's ridiculous, and it's from Illinois to Oklahoma to Cal, Al Gore owns big oil fields in LA.
[00:32:17.878 --> 00:32:18.738]  Well, he owns those.
[00:32:18.778 --> 00:32:20.679]  Here's the thing about Al Gore we have to understand.
[00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:23.500]  Remember what we said, that the oil companies
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:32.644]  Funded, founded, and sponsor the environmental organizations so that the environmental organizations can create the pretext of scarcity.
[00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:36.326]  We would love to build new refineries, but we can't because of the environmentalists.
[00:32:36.686 --> 00:32:45.171]  We would love to go into the ocean, the offshore areas off of California and Oregon and over on the Atlantic side, but the environmentalists won't let us.
[00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:47.232]  And then Schumer gets on TV and says,
[00:32:48.112 --> 00:32:58.924]  We would have a one cent decrease in twenty years when I've had the executives on who were there and they admit that on one north shore there's almost as much as there is in Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:58.964 --> 00:33:05.430]  There's more in the whole area and it's almost sweet crude shooting out and they could put in five new pipelines in a year.
[00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:06.431]  They will not do it!
[00:33:06.632 --> 00:33:07.052]  Absolutely.
[00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:08.173]  Now why would Al Gore
[00:33:08.814 --> 00:33:10.195]  Why would he promote this global warming?
[00:33:10.215 --> 00:33:11.737]  Why would he promote environmentalism?
[00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:13.118]  Why would he become the new guru?
[00:33:13.138 --> 00:33:15.240]  They'd rather have a monopoly than a free market.
[00:33:16.441 --> 00:33:20.645]  Well, not only that, remember the Gore family, Albert Gore Sr.
[00:33:20.785 --> 00:33:25.369]  and now Albert Gore Jr., they are shields for Occidental Petroleum.
[00:33:25.449 --> 00:33:27.771]  Orman Hammer funded him.
[00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:31.715]  I mean, I can show you pictures of them sitting around the swimming pool together.
[00:33:31.875 --> 00:33:32.976]  He is the majority owner.
[00:33:33.377 --> 00:33:43.369]  I remember that when his dad died, and in seeing press reports years ago, the former Senator Gore, that Al Gore now owned the controlling stock in Occidental.
[00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:47.173]  So he's an oil man, just like Bush with Harken Oil and the others.
[00:33:47.414 --> 00:33:48.255]  He's an oil man.
[00:33:48.675 --> 00:33:51.719]  Cheney with Halliburton Oil Servicing Company.
[00:33:52.359 --> 00:33:53.580]  We have oil men.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.601]  Al Gore is an oil man.
[00:33:55.941 --> 00:33:57.242]  He was brought up in oil.
[00:33:57.643 --> 00:34:18.596]  His father was a paid shill for Occidental Petroleum, which was owned, by the way, by a, and this is really an oxymoron, a communist capitalist, Armand Hammer, that every year ran back and forth to visit with the... But as Carol Quigley said... Pope Fubas of communist Russia... They want monopolies to deal with, so they help put the communists in.
[00:34:19.196 --> 00:34:21.843]  Well, Al Gore now is going to become a billionaire.
[00:34:23.525 --> 00:34:28.927]  He recently became one of the principals of a corporation worth $683 million, I believe.
[00:34:29.207 --> 00:34:30.848]  And they trade in the energy stocks.
[00:34:31.148 --> 00:34:32.629]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:38.091]  But remember, the important thing is they must create this scarcity that they're lying about.
[00:34:38.551 --> 00:34:46.614]  And the only way they can create it is by bottling up all the world's oil, all the world's water, all the world's resources, including the food.
[00:34:46.654 --> 00:34:48.555]  That's why the agribusiness corporations
[00:34:49.415 --> 00:34:56.319]  Willie Nelson has done a great thing to help the little farmers, but they only are producing a small percentage of the food.
[00:34:56.439 --> 00:34:58.580]  It's the agribusiness corporations.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.941]  They own the food supply.
[00:34:59.961 --> 00:35:07.565]  Since they've moved in, now, what was it, 50 years ago, they said we could supply the world three and a half times over with what we had currently.
[00:35:08.285 --> 00:35:10.727]  Now we are bringing 30 plus percent of our food in.
[00:35:11.907 --> 00:35:12.847]  There is so much food.
[00:35:12.867 --> 00:35:16.709]  Listen, the warehouses are bursting at the seams with food now around the world.
[00:35:17.129 --> 00:35:20.330]  You know, when I was a young man... They've been speculating and hoarding and waiting to sell.
[00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:24.091]  Well, of course, the commodity speculators, they are the speculators.
[00:35:24.472 --> 00:35:30.894]  If they drive up the price of wheat 67%, they're the ones that own all the futures and the futures markets.
[00:35:31.174 --> 00:35:33.555]  Chicago is the world's leader.
[00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:37.297]  They're holding onto it to drive it up.
[00:35:37.357 --> 00:35:39.318]  Explain how that works.
[00:35:39.718 --> 00:35:44.600]  Well, first of all, they buy a Futures, which is really a bet.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.802]  It's a Las Vegas bet saying that food prices will go up.
[00:35:48.943 --> 00:35:51.464]  And when they go up, they make billions of dollars.
[00:35:51.784 --> 00:35:54.485]  If the food prices don't go up, they don't make their billions.
[00:35:55.606 --> 00:35:58.448]  They do, just like the oil, they guarantee and rig the future.
[00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:59.890]  To create scarcity.
[00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:07.736]  They can, for example, claim, because remember now, they're the agribusiness corporations, they can claim there's a blight on wheat, and the wheat supply is ruined.
[00:36:07.756 --> 00:36:13.541]  They can claim that the winter frost killed the coffee down in South America.
[00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:23.209]  They can also blame it, and I've actually looked at these numbers now, they can also blame it on the ethanol, when that's a tiny fraction of it, which the Saudis want shut down.
[00:36:23.809 --> 00:36:27.695]  Well, and of course, ethanol is a silly thing, because the world is awash in petroleum.
[00:36:27.715 --> 00:36:28.917]  It is silly, but they don't like it.
[00:36:29.257 --> 00:36:33.042]  Now, I want to prove our point on this planet petroleum.
[00:36:33.303 --> 00:36:36.287]  Because a lot of people out there say, I've heard so much about peak oil.
[00:36:36.728 --> 00:36:38.290]  Surely we are running out of oil.
[00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.451]  Now, first I want to mention
[00:36:40.032 --> 00:36:40.132]  Yes.
[00:37:09.952 --> 00:37:12.195]  In 1980, there would be no more oil left in the world.
[00:37:12.375 --> 00:37:12.976]  By 1980.
[00:37:13.256 --> 00:37:14.798]  Yes, and we'd have an ice age too.
[00:37:14.898 --> 00:37:19.343]  Yeah, and they keep moving up the date, you know, of when the oil is going to run out.
[00:37:19.563 --> 00:37:24.208]  Like they say, we're about to have 10 years of super cooling, but that's the global warming coming.
[00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:32.593]  Well, you know, Alex, first of all, no one has ever looked at, if it were true, I wish global warming was a fact, and let me tell you why.
[00:37:32.613 --> 00:37:33.594]  The Iberian maxim.
[00:37:34.554 --> 00:37:34.914]  It does.
[00:37:35.415 --> 00:37:37.736]  And farmers could plant more crops.
[00:37:37.776 --> 00:37:38.876]  There would be more food.
[00:37:39.177 --> 00:37:44.399]  It would be a green, green world if we had global warming, because the frost wouldn't come and kill off things.
[00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:45.920]  They'd have vineyards again in London.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:46.580]  Absolutely.
[00:37:46.761 --> 00:37:48.762]  And if the Arctic ice melted,
[00:37:49.562 --> 00:37:49.943]  Guess what?
[00:37:49.983 --> 00:37:54.147]  We could take those icebergs, as they're breaking off, bring them, and that would be the water source!
[00:37:54.368 --> 00:37:55.409]  Well, Texas... Wow!
[00:37:55.569 --> 00:37:55.929]  Exactly.
[00:37:55.949 --> 00:38:03.158]  But wait, they could, you know, bring those around, pull them around, and you would have billions, trillions of barrels of water.
[00:38:03.258 --> 00:38:03.698]  But wait!
[00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:06.782]  Then you could get through the permafrost, which wouldn't exist anymore.
[00:38:07.222 --> 00:38:10.943]  And all of the oil in the Arctic, can you imagine we would really be awash in oil?
[00:38:11.183 --> 00:38:12.544]  Let's have global warming!
[00:38:12.744 --> 00:38:28.890]  But listen, there is, unfortunately, unfortunately, there is no global warming, because as you know, you well know, you're a researcher, the world's four top weather tracking organizations now say we are going into a global cooling period.
[00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.251]  Because the sun had heated up briefly, now it's cooled.
[00:38:31.531 --> 00:38:31.791]  Yeah.
[00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:35.232]  And the entire solar system's moons... It's a cyclical thing, a natural cyclical thing.
[00:38:35.512 --> 00:38:36.773]  Well, I mean, take Mars.
[00:38:37.353 --> 00:38:43.716]  Ice cap was receding, and now it's getting bigger again than it just started, and they have exact measurements with the satellites.
[00:38:44.056 --> 00:38:47.117]  But I have David Rothschild on, and he just said, nope, there's no ice caps.
[00:38:47.657 --> 00:38:50.158]  And we confronted Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:38:50.359 --> 00:38:52.519]  He said, there's no ice caps on Mars, everybody knows that.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:57.602]  And then he went on to say, Rothschild, that Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun than Earth.
[00:38:58.422 --> 00:39:02.364]  Well, you know, in Minnesota, you go up to Duluth, Minnesota,
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.001]  And I'll tell you, in the wintertime, there's plenty of ice and snow.
[00:39:06.021 --> 00:39:07.022]  Okay?
[00:39:07.582 --> 00:39:08.463]  I love the people of Minnesota.
[00:39:08.483 --> 00:39:09.203]  I don't want to live there.
[00:39:09.543 --> 00:39:09.963]  But you know what?
[00:39:09.983 --> 00:39:13.365]  You go there in summertime, and it actually gets pretty hot there.
[00:39:13.765 --> 00:39:16.267]  There is no ice in the summer in Minnesota.
[00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:17.747]  Does that mean we're in global warming?
[00:39:17.787 --> 00:39:17.967]  No!
[00:39:18.027 --> 00:39:19.768]  It means we've gone into a new season.
[00:39:19.808 --> 00:39:20.569]  It's summertime!
[00:39:21.629 --> 00:39:23.810]  They also fearmonger every summer.
[00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.952]  In the middle of August they'll be saying record heat.
[00:39:26.972 --> 00:39:27.852]  I grew up in Dallas.
[00:39:27.892 --> 00:39:28.633]  I remember 115 days.
[00:39:28.773 --> 00:39:31.154]  I remember a red sun.
[00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:32.955]  I remember the grass all dead.
[00:39:33.175 --> 00:39:36.836]  And they're telling me in Texas at 105 some deadly super wave.
[00:39:37.116 --> 00:39:38.957]  I have seen the mercury at 115 for a month straight.
[00:39:40.598 --> 00:39:47.889]  The Al Gores of this world cannot wait for June, July, and August to get here when the temperature naturally, every summer, goes up.
[00:39:47.909 --> 00:39:49.311]  And then they can say, it's a little warmer.
[00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:50.172]  That's psychology.
[00:39:50.192 --> 00:39:50.673]  Psychology.
[00:39:50.733 --> 00:39:50.833]  Yeah.
[00:39:50.853 --> 00:39:51.594]  Well, here's an example.
[00:39:52.195 --> 00:39:55.700]  If you give people the scientific name for water, they will say bannet.
[00:39:56.533 --> 00:40:00.276]  Or you tell them, sodium chloride, should we make kids eat sodium chloride?
[00:40:00.296 --> 00:40:00.977]  No, no, ban it.
[00:40:02.518 --> 00:40:03.659]  It's bad for them.
[00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:05.640]  If they didn't have sodium chloride, people would die.
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:08.022]  They've got to have a certain amount of salt.
[00:40:08.062 --> 00:40:08.783]  That's my point.
[00:40:08.803 --> 00:40:09.783]  Go back to satellites.
[00:40:10.684 --> 00:40:19.031]  They have now said, five years ago, we're going to have the spy satellites watch farmers, make sure you're not planting trees in environmental areas, make sure you're not cutting down things.
[00:40:19.051 --> 00:40:22.153]  They're now saying they want to cut down trees, because they also put out carbon dioxide.
[00:40:22.193 --> 00:40:22.894]  That was the new thing.
[00:40:23.094 --> 00:40:23.794]  Now trees are bad.
[00:40:24.115 --> 00:40:24.715]  That was yesterday.
[00:40:25.996 --> 00:40:29.018]  They're actually haters of nature.
[00:40:29.078 --> 00:40:29.358]  They are.
[00:40:29.398 --> 00:40:30.418]  They're haters of nature.
[00:40:30.458 --> 00:40:31.119]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:32.840]  They claim to be lovers, but they are haters.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.661]  They claim they want to save the earth, but that was my next point.
[00:40:36.001 --> 00:40:37.162]  Why do they really love to hurt it?
[00:40:37.921 --> 00:40:49.950]  Well, you know, around Chicago, Illinois, when the old horse Greeley is saying, go west, young man, go west, well, many people moved to Illinois in the United States and settled around there.
[00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:51.571]  At that time, they didn't have any trees.
[00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:53.352]  They brought trees from the east, they planted them.
[00:40:53.572 --> 00:40:55.073]  And then, of course, the seeds went through there.
[00:40:55.374 --> 00:40:57.075]  That's why there's more trees now than there were a hundred years ago.
[00:40:57.095 --> 00:40:59.196]  Yeah, there's more trees in America than there were a hundred years ago.
[00:40:59.216 --> 00:41:00.497]  It's more green than it was.
[00:41:00.878 --> 00:41:03.720]  Interestingly enough, though, environmental organizations in Illinois
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:10.925]  are now demanding, they have actually counted, they say, the trees in suburban Illinois, Chicago.
[00:41:11.325 --> 00:41:15.689]  They say there are 80,000 trees, and they're demanding those trees be cut down.
[00:41:16.029 --> 00:41:18.251]  They want to cut down all the 80,000 trees.
[00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:18.831]  Why?
[00:41:19.252 --> 00:41:25.517]  They say, well, originally, Illinois was a plain state, and it had all these grasses.
[00:41:25.737 --> 00:41:28.519]  We want to return to the native grasses.
[00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:30.881]  Yeah, yeah, your new trees are an invasive species.
[00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:32.522]  Yeah, but see, that's it.
[00:41:32.802 --> 00:41:35.484]  Well, they're beautiful trees, and for, you know, thankfully.
[00:41:35.524 --> 00:41:45.730]  Listen, they make you do asinine things because they know psychologically, you know, as a psychology professor, you know, if they can make you do something stupid, they can make you do anything else they want.
[00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:54.576]  Yes, now, if it's true that Illinois once was grassland, and they want to cut down all the trees and return it to grassland, but at one time was not Illinois
[00:41:55.718 --> 00:41:56.379]  Ice covered?
[00:41:56.419 --> 00:41:56.659]  Yes.
[00:41:56.939 --> 00:41:58.581]  Why don't we return to the ice then?
[00:41:58.721 --> 00:42:03.205]  At one time it was a... At what historical point do we go back to, you know?
[00:42:03.265 --> 00:42:04.606]  But at one point it was an inland sea.
[00:42:04.986 --> 00:42:05.867]  There was the inland sea.
[00:42:06.147 --> 00:42:16.176]  Well, of course, all of these things are a means of mind control, of causing radical transformation in society, just like this new reality, this age of scarcity.
[00:42:16.637 --> 00:42:22.522]  Now, what I would really like is to give some evidence of how we are awash in petroleum, Alex.
[00:42:23.122 --> 00:42:25.923]  People need to have the tools and the ammunition to use.
[00:42:26.064 --> 00:42:26.404]  Stay there.
[00:42:26.424 --> 00:42:35.008]  I want to come back during this break if people are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv or if people are listening on the InfoWars.com streams.
[00:42:35.228 --> 00:42:36.908]  You'll be able to hear me and Tex talk about another subject.
[00:42:37.028 --> 00:42:38.489]  We're going to come back and finish up with that.
[00:42:38.769 --> 00:42:40.030]  Tex Marr is in studio with us.
[00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:41.330]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:42:41.571 --> 00:42:42.171]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:44.036 --> 00:42:47.222]  Okay, Tex, we have a new development?
[00:42:47.242 --> 00:42:49.686]  Come on, I normally handle business during the breaks here.
[00:42:49.966 --> 00:42:52.931]  Tex, we just absolutely rampage here non-stop.
[00:42:53.833 --> 00:42:54.474]  Okay, thank you.
[00:42:57.395 --> 00:42:59.156]  Oh my gosh, we just found DC Manum.
[00:42:59.556 --> 00:43:01.257]  I'd never want my life to end in suicide.
[00:43:01.317 --> 00:43:02.077]  More of that coming up.
[00:43:02.337 --> 00:43:04.358]  Thank you very much, Aaron.
[00:43:04.438 --> 00:43:10.941]  Tex, I want to keep you, if we can, about 15 minutes to the next hour, or are you and Wanda planning something?
[00:43:11.502 --> 00:43:12.742]  We're planning to be right here with you.
[00:43:12.922 --> 00:43:15.143]  Whatever we need to do, because this is too important.
[00:43:15.223 --> 00:43:15.583]  Okay, good.
[00:43:15.623 --> 00:43:19.285]  Guys, make sure you call Hoffman, and make sure he knows he's coming on the 15 after next hour.
[00:43:19.565 --> 00:43:20.746]  Let's make deadly sure about that.
[00:43:20.766 --> 00:43:21.046]  Thank you.
[00:43:21.246 --> 00:43:26.591]  By the way, I recommend people continue to tune in because Michael Hoffman is a source of information.
[00:43:27.312 --> 00:43:28.093]  A terrific researcher.
[00:43:28.113 --> 00:43:35.600]  Well, we have you, we have everybody that talks about all these subjects, and then other talk show hosts that are jealous, Tex, and that's sad because we need everybody to win.
[00:43:36.241 --> 00:43:40.445]  They all freak out and claim I censor all subjects when I cover everything forever.
[00:43:41.105 --> 00:43:46.187]  But again, people always want to say, I'm the best, I'll cover all the special things, but that's not true.
[00:43:46.447 --> 00:43:52.089]  We cover the entire spectrum, that's why we've been successful, whereas most people limit in the tiny little areas.
[00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:53.589]  Well there, Johnny, one note.
[00:43:53.709 --> 00:43:58.271]  I thank God for these people that have a special knowledge in one area.
[00:43:59.071 --> 00:44:01.632]  But right now we're being assaulted on so many fronts.
[00:44:02.352 --> 00:44:06.194]  We've got to keep up, and we've got to be able to defend ourselves as human beings and citizens.
[00:44:06.234 --> 00:44:07.315]  You call it an alchemy, it is!
[00:44:07.355 --> 00:44:08.476]  I mean, it's an art form.
[00:44:08.636 --> 00:44:10.517]  They understand it's thousands of things they do.
[00:44:10.537 --> 00:44:10.757]  Go ahead.
[00:44:11.097 --> 00:44:11.858]  Well, they've got the money.
[00:44:11.898 --> 00:44:14.979]  They've got the billions of dollars and resources to do this.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.543]  Back to the... I have several things here that I want us to look at.
[00:44:21.483 --> 00:44:22.663]  Here's from Yahoo Finance.
[00:44:22.683 --> 00:44:25.304]  Well, I'll tell you what, the main stations are back in two minutes.
[00:44:25.364 --> 00:44:26.205]  They're back in two minutes.
[00:44:26.225 --> 00:44:27.385]  So take that then.
[00:44:27.425 --> 00:44:29.826]  We're just talking about generally everything that's happening.
[00:44:29.846 --> 00:44:33.427]  I also want to be able to plug your free newsletter and everything else for people.
[00:44:33.447 --> 00:44:34.287]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:36.668]  And some of the newest works you've done.
[00:44:37.369 --> 00:44:40.511]  Well, I really want people to get this book, Days of Hunger, Days of Chaos.
[00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:45.915]  They'll find out how these chemical corporations now control our seeds.
[00:44:46.835 --> 00:44:48.957]  You know, they've managed to make crops.
[00:44:49.897 --> 00:44:53.740]  The seeds destroy themselves through science in one year.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:59.744]  Each year, the seeds are destroyed, and farmers have to go back and buy the seeds from these huge corporations.
[00:45:00.244 --> 00:45:06.969]  At the same time, I want people to understand, we're going to end up, and by the way, you know, I'm a Christian, and even Bible prophecy
[00:45:07.569 --> 00:45:18.036]  Says one of the four riders, you know, the horses and the riders of the apocalypse, one of them brings famine and pestilence and death.
[00:45:18.076 --> 00:45:20.377]  The pale horse rider and the black horse rider.
[00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:24.200]  So this is even a prophetic thing that there'll be great hunger.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.040]  Now here's the horror of this.
[00:45:26.281 --> 00:45:29.522]  It's a contrived, it's a false hunger.
[00:45:29.922 --> 00:45:33.043]  There will be warehouses full of food, but people will be starving.
[00:45:33.304 --> 00:45:35.784]  You remember back in the 1930s, depression.
[00:45:36.405 --> 00:45:45.388]  I had many older people who told me that they would see the milk trucks, you know, almost like the refrigerated milk trucks and such, and they would be throwing milk out.
[00:45:45.408 --> 00:45:46.868]  Stay there, let's say that on the show.
[00:45:46.888 --> 00:45:47.228]  Here we go.
[00:45:54.815 --> 00:45:56.496]  Okay, we're coming back in fast here.
[00:45:56.516 --> 00:45:57.937]  We're going to keep Tex a little bit in the next hour.
[00:45:57.957 --> 00:45:58.918]  He's been great enough to do that.
[00:45:59.198 --> 00:46:01.759]  TexMarsch.com will give you all the contact info.
[00:46:01.779 --> 00:46:04.661]  Now he'll get his free newsletter and a lot more in a few minutes.
[00:46:05.141 --> 00:46:06.882]  But before we do that, I want to be clear here.
[00:46:07.503 --> 00:46:15.308]  Using the satellites, having local police dial into them, spying on you, micromanaging, that federalizes the locals, violates your Fourth Amendment,
[00:46:16.248 --> 00:46:18.609]  You think you're under control and surveillance now.
[00:46:18.689 --> 00:46:21.650]  It's all going to be done under the guise of saving the earth.
[00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:25.532]  Meanwhile, they're doing the genetic engineering and everything that really is hurting the earth.
[00:46:26.472 --> 00:46:28.013]  So we have all of that going on.
[00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:34.736]  And meanwhile, you read the Monsanto documents and they say, you know, we're going to contaminate everything, then claim ownership of the world.
[00:46:35.076 --> 00:46:40.298]  This is systematic wrecking of economy, systematic destruction, artificial scarcity.
[00:46:40.658 --> 00:46:43.720]  Text Mars, please continue with all the points you were going to make about that.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.964]  About the depression, how they had the milk trucks, how they really had plenty, how they cut down on the credit, artificially did it.
[00:46:49.285 --> 00:46:50.806]  All the news articles, you've got the floor.
[00:46:51.482 --> 00:46:57.448]  Well, it's important to understand that these are contrived chaos events.
[00:46:57.949 --> 00:46:58.810]  Contrived chaos.
[00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:05.477]  Remember the elitist motto, even 33rd degree Freemasonry, is Ordo Ab Chaos.
[00:47:05.938 --> 00:47:06.959]  Order out of chaos.
[00:47:07.239 --> 00:47:11.624]  They create the chaos, and now they're doing it with oil and the economy.
[00:47:11.864 --> 00:47:13.206]  They're doing it with food.
[00:47:14.347 --> 00:47:15.848]  And they're doing it with water.
[00:47:17.169 --> 00:47:21.873]  Not to even mention the contrived terrorism that we have today.
[00:47:22.294 --> 00:47:23.615]  That is the umbrella for all this.
[00:47:24.015 --> 00:47:26.518]  What I want people to know, though, is we can fight back.
[00:47:27.018 --> 00:47:28.119]  We can fight back.
[00:47:28.399 --> 00:47:29.060]  How do we do it?
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:39.890]  When they say that we're moving into an age of scarcity, and all of our lives have to change, and we have to become a third world impoverished nation, and we just have to suck it up, that's just too bad.
[00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:45.792]  And we have to put up with $4, even $10 at the gas pump for a gallon of gasoline.
[00:47:46.132 --> 00:47:49.534]  We need to say, no, absolutely a lie.
[00:47:49.774 --> 00:47:51.394]  There is no age of scarcity.
[00:47:51.694 --> 00:47:53.035]  We are planet petroleum.
[00:47:53.235 --> 00:47:54.415]  We're planet aqua.
[00:47:54.756 --> 00:47:55.736]  We've got plenty.
[00:47:56.356 --> 00:47:58.537]  And we need to prove it, because we can prove it.
[00:47:58.557 --> 00:48:00.338]  Wait a minute, the blue planet has no water.
[00:48:00.858 --> 00:48:02.979]  Well, it does have water.
[00:48:03.079 --> 00:48:03.959]  Of course there's water.
[00:48:04.119 --> 00:48:05.240]  There's water everywhere.
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.600]  There's always been water everywhere.
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:07.660]  But water is deadly poison.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:08.641]  We must tax it.
[00:48:09.508 --> 00:48:14.792]  Well, yeah, there's a solution that they come up with, of course.
[00:48:15.132 --> 00:48:16.293]  Just like in the food area.
[00:48:16.713 --> 00:48:26.019]  I understand that Barack Obama introduced, as a senator, introduced legislation that would tax the American people one and a half percent of their income.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:38.347]  The money would go, again this is a new tax levied against us, the money then, the billions that they plunder from the people, would go to the United Nations to feed the hungry of the world.
[00:48:38.407 --> 00:48:39.188]  And then that means
[00:48:39.969 --> 00:48:50.198]  Just like Bill Gates gives 80 plus billion to Warren Buffett, you hear it's to help Africans, it's to sterilize them, give them HIV, they've been caught, force them to eat GMO food, force Big Agra in.
[00:48:50.518 --> 00:48:53.181]  All the help they give you is really an assault.
[00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:54.442]  It's just like taking money from the lobby.
[00:48:54.462 --> 00:48:54.742]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:48:55.263 --> 00:49:04.171]  John McCain, on the other hand, to show that we're not knocking any one political candidate, John McCain, on the other hand, said, hey, listen, for this summer only,
[00:49:04.992 --> 00:49:07.695]  Let's, you know, knock off the tax for the gasoline.
[00:49:07.975 --> 00:49:11.419]  That'll save everybody, what, you know, $30 a month.
[00:49:11.559 --> 00:49:12.260]  Isn't that great?
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:16.184]  But he doesn't see any problem at all with gasoline tripling in price.
[00:49:16.564 --> 00:49:23.111]  He probably would not see one problem with gasoline going to $10 a gallon and the oil companies enriching themselves.
[00:49:23.131 --> 00:49:24.912]  Well, that's a tax to the globalists right there.
[00:49:24.992 --> 00:49:25.473]  Well, it is.
[00:49:25.833 --> 00:49:32.938]  So, they say no problem with the oil company profits being at spectacular record highs and these contrived shortages.
[00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:37.481]  And I remember hearing them ten years ago, five years ago on NPR, because my wife listens to it, you know, cooking dinner.
[00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:44.145]  And I listen, and it's always, soon the Americans will learn, oh, I can't wait, we're so greedy and bad.
[00:49:44.525 --> 00:49:47.207]  Soon, you know, we've been living outside our means.
[00:49:47.527 --> 00:49:48.008]  Oh, oh, sure.
[00:49:48.048 --> 00:49:50.609]  You shouldn't be driving around in those big cars and going places.
[00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:52.931]  And by the way, you should be living in those cramped
[00:49:54.271 --> 00:49:55.752]  You know, you should be living downtown.
[00:49:55.872 --> 00:49:58.953]  After all, you shouldn't... What are you doing living in the suburbs?
[00:49:59.033 --> 00:49:59.933]  Smart growth.
[00:49:59.973 --> 00:50:01.974]  That waste... But really, it's all about control.
[00:50:02.154 --> 00:50:04.475]  And I know a lot of wealthy people, they say, well, you know what?
[00:50:04.515 --> 00:50:04.735]  So what?
[00:50:04.775 --> 00:50:06.115]  I can pay five bucks a gallon for gas.
[00:50:06.435 --> 00:50:09.396]  Yeah, but their businesses are connected to the general public who can't.
[00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:10.717]  This is going to hurt everybody.
[00:50:11.377 --> 00:50:22.124]  I don't think that McCain or Obama or Hillary Clinton or George Bush have ever driven up to an Exxon and put gasoline in their car.
[00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.145]  Remember George Bush Senior?
[00:50:23.165 --> 00:50:23.845]  They don't do that.
[00:50:23.865 --> 00:50:24.986]  They drive around in limos.
[00:50:25.046 --> 00:50:26.747]  He doesn't know what a grocery store scanner is.
[00:50:27.127 --> 00:50:27.487]  Exactly.
[00:50:27.527 --> 00:50:28.308]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:28.608 --> 00:50:33.671]  It just shocked him to think the food was scanned there at the cash register.
[00:50:34.172 --> 00:50:35.012]  We can keep going, Tex.
[00:50:35.032 --> 00:50:35.332]  Go ahead.
[00:50:35.633 --> 00:50:35.953]  Alright.
[00:50:36.453 --> 00:50:40.256]  Well, when we come back, but even now, I would like to talk about the fact
[00:50:40.996 --> 00:50:47.220]  That as we are being told that we have a terrific supply problem with oil, and we're running out of oil.
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.843]  And here's a Yahoo Finance news item.
[00:50:52.204 --> 00:50:57.547]  It says, oil futures jump to record over $115 on supply concerns.
[00:50:57.847 --> 00:50:59.428]  That's what Americans are being told, Alex.
[00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:00.489]  But wait!
[00:51:01.089 --> 00:51:03.571]  Here, and this is what people don't understand.
[00:51:04.111 --> 00:51:07.053]  Some of the world's press doesn't lie as much as Americans do.
[00:51:07.374 --> 00:51:10.416]  For example, here's in The Times in London.
[00:51:11.837 --> 00:51:12.358]  What does it say?
[00:51:12.378 --> 00:51:14.060]  What does the Times newspaper say?
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:20.988]  Now this is just as mighty a newspaper as our New York Times and Los Angeles newspaper and Chicago Tribune.
[00:51:21.569 --> 00:51:25.533]  It says, world not running out of oil, say experts.
[00:51:26.354 --> 00:51:28.515]  Hey, has George Bush told us about this?
[00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:30.736]  Has McCain, Obama, Hillary?
[00:51:31.036 --> 00:51:36.499]  Have they told us that according to the London Times Newspaper, the world is not running out of oil?
[00:51:36.699 --> 00:51:38.760]  And it says here, Alex... We're going to go back live.
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.600]  I want you to cover those.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:40.961]  Recover those right now.
[00:51:40.981 --> 00:51:42.962]  And there's no need for us on our streams to be cutting.
[00:51:42.982 --> 00:51:44.022]  We can just go straight with this.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.803]  Alright, we're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:52.823 --> 00:51:54.304]  Just continually live now, Tex.
[00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:55.345]  Time to do show work.
[00:51:55.365 --> 00:51:57.548]  We're going to go back up right now.
[00:51:57.588 --> 00:52:01.472]  Well, one of the main things we have to understand... I've got to give you some headphones, Tex.
[00:52:01.812 --> 00:52:02.453]  It's my fault.
[00:52:02.473 --> 00:52:03.514]  Tex Mars, what a sweetheart.
[00:52:03.534 --> 00:52:04.255]  Alright, John, fade me up.
[00:52:04.275 --> 00:52:04.575]  You're live.
[00:52:10.721 --> 00:52:11.542]  Alex Jones.
[00:52:12.082 --> 00:52:14.303]  Alright Tex, it does come out that there's tons of oil.
[00:52:14.343 --> 00:52:15.523]  A lot of the truth does come out.
[00:52:15.544 --> 00:52:20.326]  It's just the general public is still convinced that summer is global warming.
[00:52:20.766 --> 00:52:23.027]  And I notice the propaganda intensifies then.
[00:52:23.367 --> 00:52:25.288]  Continue here with what's really happening.
[00:52:25.708 --> 00:52:27.910]  Well, let's look at this planet awash with oil.
[00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:32.652]  Here I have from Yahoo, one of the major American news sources,
[00:52:33.313 --> 00:52:40.086]  This claim, it says all futures jump to record over $115 a barrel on supply concerns.
[00:52:40.326 --> 00:52:42.771]  In other words, we're running low, we don't have enough.
[00:52:43.172 --> 00:52:43.713]  But wait!
[00:52:44.074 --> 00:52:44.274]  Wait!
[00:52:45.322 --> 00:52:49.484]  You know, the foreign press doesn't seem to want to lie as much as the American press.
[00:52:49.524 --> 00:52:50.645]  Maybe it's not as controlled.
[00:52:51.005 --> 00:52:52.506]  Here's the Times of London.
[00:52:52.866 --> 00:53:00.631]  Now, just as mighty a newspaper, as I was mentioning, as the New York Times or the Chicago Tribune or the Houston Chronicle, what does it say?
[00:53:00.991 --> 00:53:04.173]  World not running out of oil, say experts.
[00:53:05.213 --> 00:53:16.220]  And it begins, says, doom-laden forecast that world oil supplies are poised to fall off the edge of the cliff are wide off the mark according to leading oil industry experts.
[00:53:17.141 --> 00:53:17.421]  Wow!
[00:53:18.683 --> 00:53:19.344]  Who would have known?
[00:53:19.364 --> 00:53:20.846]  Would John McCain tell us this?
[00:53:21.767 --> 00:53:22.768]  Would Barack Obama?
[00:53:22.788 --> 00:53:23.409]  Would Hillary?
[00:53:23.449 --> 00:53:24.410]  Would George W.?
[00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:25.992]  Now here's something interesting.
[00:53:26.012 --> 00:53:33.902]  If we want to see that the world is awash with oil, remember what I said was it's not a matter of how much oil in the world.
[00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:35.464]  The world has plenty.
[00:53:35.544 --> 00:53:36.365]  It's the delivery system.
[00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:38.466]  It's a deliberatism, which is controlled.
[00:53:38.866 --> 00:53:41.947]  A contrived crisis to drive up the prices.
[00:53:41.967 --> 00:53:46.369]  Well, it's like diamonds are really on the mid-scale or lower scale of even semi-precious.
[00:53:46.649 --> 00:53:48.510]  They're not even highly semi-precious.
[00:53:48.890 --> 00:54:00.674]  I mean, in Africa, they just lay around on the ground, but people fight, you know, mortgage their house, work a year to pay for a big rock for their wife, because that's the symbol, and literally they have giant warehouses just filled with diamonds.
[00:54:01.314 --> 00:54:02.515]  Now, here's an interesting thing.
[00:54:03.215 --> 00:54:06.456]  Maybe people haven't heard about the oil discovery done in Brazil.
[00:54:07.197 --> 00:54:09.718]  But listen to this from Bloomberg.com.
[00:54:09.758 --> 00:54:10.698]  Bloomberg, okay?
[00:54:10.978 --> 00:54:15.100]  One of the top sources of financial and industry information in the world.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.921]  It says Petrobras.
[00:54:17.001 --> 00:54:22.563]  Now, that's the petroleum company that's owned by the nation of Brazil, okay?
[00:54:23.083 --> 00:54:28.846]  Now, Petrobras, by the way, is a corporation as big as Microsoft, General Motors, and General Electric.
[00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:32.249]  It's right there in the top five in all of the Americas.
[00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:37.074]  It says Petrobras discovers world's third largest oil field.
[00:54:37.675 --> 00:54:38.616]  This just came out.
[00:54:38.956 --> 00:54:39.577]  Listen to this.
[00:54:39.637 --> 00:54:41.679]  This is a story that just ran April 14th.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:46.925]  It says Petrolio Brasilia, that's Petrobras, offshore, Carioca,
[00:54:47.825 --> 00:54:59.228]  The oil field may hold 33 million barrels of oil, enough to supply every refinery in the United States for six years, making it the third largest oil field ever discovered.
[00:54:59.448 --> 00:55:00.129]  All for Brazil!
[00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.989]  In the Atlantic!
[00:55:01.509 --> 00:55:03.129]  Can you imagine the oil there?
[00:55:03.509 --> 00:55:04.330]  Petrobras?
[00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:05.270]  Amazing!
[00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:06.490]  And the Russians are founded.
[00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:07.131]  It's just everywhere.
[00:55:08.951 --> 00:55:16.917]  Listen, the United States, according to the industry experts so-called, claim that we have 29 billion barrels in reserve.
[00:55:17.378 --> 00:55:20.460]  Hey, they've got 33 billion down there in Brazil.
[00:55:20.841 --> 00:55:24.704]  Forget about Hugo Chavez and Venezuela, I'm talking about Brazil.
[00:55:24.984 --> 00:55:28.026]  Did you know that the Brazilian stock market went wild with this?
[00:55:28.226 --> 00:55:31.749]  The telephone companies, anything that's Brazilian went wild.
[00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:33.230]  I mean, it's booming right now.
[00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:33.611]  Why?
[00:55:33.991 --> 00:55:36.253]  They have oil that's going to be coming out their ears.
[00:55:36.793 --> 00:55:37.875]  But wait, that's not all.
[00:55:38.195 --> 00:55:40.238]  Look, why do you think we're in Kosovo?
[00:55:40.839 --> 00:55:42.340]  Again, just like why we're in Iraq.
[00:55:42.641 --> 00:55:44.744]  Look at this news item.
[00:55:45.184 --> 00:55:52.334]  Large potential Albanian, that's right there in the Kosovo area, oil and gas discovery underscores
[00:55:52.774 --> 00:55:53.854]  Kosovo's importance.
[00:55:53.994 --> 00:56:00.097]  One reason that I read 10 years ago that they staged the invasion was because they found oil, uranium, silver, nickel.
[00:56:00.117 --> 00:56:01.337]  There it is.
[00:56:01.437 --> 00:56:02.377]  There is a confirmation.
[00:56:02.417 --> 00:56:04.998]  Al-Qaeda helped again to take over the country.
[00:56:05.098 --> 00:56:07.359]  Now let's look at the United States itself, okay?
[00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:11.140]  Oh well, we have to get 60% of our oil from foreign sources.
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:11.520]  Really?
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.621]  Well look at this.
[00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:15.262]  The Bakken oil formation.
[00:56:15.422 --> 00:56:16.862]  Welcome to the next oil boom.
[00:56:17.182 --> 00:56:17.863]  The U.S.
[00:56:17.923 --> 00:56:19.123]  Geological Survey.
[00:56:19.989 --> 00:56:23.311]  has just published its official results of a groundbreaking study.
[00:56:24.391 --> 00:56:26.692]  Up in North Dakota, who would have believed it?
[00:56:27.032 --> 00:56:37.197]  South of North Dakota and Montana, they have found a store of oil that could last America, could take care of all of our oil needs for a thousand years in South of North Dakota!
[00:56:37.217 --> 00:56:40.458]  Final segment with Tex Mars and Michael Hoffman coming up.
[00:56:40.478 --> 00:56:42.379]  We're going to take this break and then be right back.
[00:56:42.419 --> 00:56:43.840]  We're doing behind the scenes interviews.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:49.122]  If you're on InfoWars.com internet stream, listener, or PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, we'll be right back.
[00:57:03.826 --> 00:57:09.948]  You of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at TruthNews.us and PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:57:30.253 --> 00:57:30.953]  We're good to go.
[00:57:50.658 --> 00:57:54.802]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[00:57:55.062 --> 00:58:00.187]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[00:58:00.488 --> 00:58:05.192]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[00:58:05.513 --> 00:58:07.495]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[00:58:07.815 --> 00:58:13.741]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:58:14.081 --> 00:58:14.902]  And it works.
[00:58:15.302 --> 00:58:16.783]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[00:58:17.163 --> 00:58:18.163]  Now it's your turn.
[00:58:18.443 --> 00:58:20.824]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[00:58:21.084 --> 00:58:25.385]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[00:58:25.565 --> 00:58:28.586]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[00:58:28.866 --> 00:58:31.067]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[00:58:31.287 --> 00:58:33.568]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-457-9914.

[00:58:33.868 --> 00:58:36.629]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.

[00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:44.414]  Call 1-800-457-9914.

[00:58:50.646 --> 00:58:53.208]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[00:58:53.588 --> 00:58:56.431]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known.
[00:58:56.451 --> 00:58:57.972]  Heal itself from many ailments.
[00:58:58.312 --> 00:59:04.757]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:59:05.077 --> 00:59:09.401]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:59:09.621 --> 00:59:11.502]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[00:59:29.474 --> 00:59:31.836]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:59:32.096 --> 00:59:34.838]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.888 --> 00:59:41.411]  It is the final segment with Tex Mars.
[00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:45.176]  I'm going to recap briefly what's happened with the Evergene Palfrey murder.
[00:59:45.376 --> 00:59:47.919]  And that's even what mainstream television is saying.
[00:59:47.939 --> 00:59:53.887]  Before we finish up with how they're having these contrived artificial scares to these techs in this key area that you're exposing.
[00:59:57.762 --> 01:00:00.384]  You said you were watching Nancy Grace and she was saying this is suspicious.
[01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:02.985]  We played some clips from Fox where they're saying it's suspicious.
[01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:14.253]  I mean, this is getting ridiculous when the prostitute under her, who was a college professor, going to get like an extra PhD at the time, was facing six months in jail and hung herself.
[01:00:14.813 --> 01:00:23.338]  Saying she was going to shoot her mouth off, and then now she's telling everybody, you know, if they kill me, you know, I was killed, I'm not going to kill myself.
[01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:30.963]  Then they have this government spook type come out, who makes up all this stuff and has a history of it, saying, oh, she just called me and said she was going to kill herself.
[01:00:31.403 --> 01:00:32.924]  And then the media runs with that.
[01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:35.006]  I mean, they are really getting desperate.
[01:00:35.726 --> 01:00:37.907]  Well, they're getting desperate, but they're also getting bold!
[01:00:38.347 --> 01:00:39.528]  I mean, they're shameless!
[01:00:40.048 --> 01:00:44.270]  And by the way, the Nancy Graces, the Fox News, we'll see how far they go with this.
[01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:51.312]  Because this is an explosive issue, and it could go up, as you mentioned, to the McCains and the Cheneys and so forth.
[01:00:52.353 --> 01:00:54.614]  I think we also need to look for Vicky Eisman.
[01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:56.751]  You know, is she still available?
[01:00:57.071 --> 01:00:58.132]  Is she still alive?
[01:00:58.352 --> 01:00:58.973]  Where is she?
[01:00:59.513 --> 01:01:00.674]  Did you hear about this weird thing?
[01:01:00.694 --> 01:01:05.138]  You know, McCain's little girl that he was having a little teat-a-teat with.
[01:01:05.318 --> 01:01:17.168]  Well, there was a high-level CIA operative who did things with the police chief and CIA director and was all over TV and headed up one of the regional intelligence agent groups, clubs.
[01:01:17.808 --> 01:01:19.629]  And the cops reportedly started chasing him.
[01:01:19.669 --> 01:01:21.470]  He ran, and then he stops.
[01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:22.430]  Well, first they said he ran.
[01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:23.330]  He didn't run.
[01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.751]  He gets out of the car nicely, and they blast him.
[01:01:25.791 --> 01:01:27.332]  So it turns out the first story was a lie.
[01:01:27.672 --> 01:01:28.392]  And it's on video.
[01:01:28.412 --> 01:01:29.293]  The cop just walks up.
[01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:30.853]  The guy's there, and the cop's shooting.
[01:01:30.873 --> 01:01:34.675]  And of course, we know they have hit men on the police forces in every major city, especially Houston.
[01:01:35.075 --> 01:01:35.856]  That's one of the worst.
[01:01:36.916 --> 01:01:39.297]  I mean, now there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[01:01:39.377 --> 01:01:54.187]  And this local Palestinian had his railings with machine guns running around in his yard, the neighbors said, and he was an activist, peaceful activist, he was a school teacher, and then they tortured him to death, and duct tape all over his body, threw it in the river, and the APD first said, oh yeah, he was murdered.
[01:01:54.608 --> 01:01:59.211]  I talked to people at TV stations that heard the scanners, and the police said that too, that yeah, we thought he was murdered.
[01:01:59.231 --> 01:02:04.215]  And then, no, the higher ups said, no, no, no, this is quite normal to be all tied up and sliced up.
[01:02:06.158 --> 01:02:14.045]  Well, sir, it goes all the way back to the LBJ era, when a guy was shot 32 times in the back, and they said he committed suicide.
[01:02:14.065 --> 01:02:19.369]  He was one of the guys that knew the truth about the voting irregularities in the Johnson election.
[01:02:19.389 --> 01:02:21.191]  Well, that's when you know it's the government.
[01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:25.414]  Because if it's a normal murder, they'll actually go around and maybe investigate.
[01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:30.739]  But when it's a government op, you could... I mean, the cops walk up and execute this guy, and they say, no, it's no big deal.
[01:02:31.139 --> 01:02:32.861]  You know Alex, I've known you for quite a while now.
[01:02:32.881 --> 01:02:35.063]  I know you're precious wife, Violet.
[01:02:35.663 --> 01:02:38.826]  You're a happy guy because you love to expose evil in the world.
[01:02:38.846 --> 01:02:40.728]  I think it gives you happiness to do that.
[01:02:40.908 --> 01:02:42.890]  And thank God for that, that kind of attitude.
[01:02:43.271 --> 01:02:48.696]  And that's why, I'm going to say it right now, Alex Jones would never, ever, ever commit suicide.
[01:02:49.396 --> 01:02:50.677]  No, I don't even believe that.
[01:02:50.717 --> 01:02:51.537]  That's silliness.
[01:02:51.797 --> 01:02:53.318]  They're going to have to torture me all the way to death.
[01:02:53.338 --> 01:02:53.698]  Are you kidding?
[01:02:53.758 --> 01:02:55.558]  I want to live as long as possible.
[01:02:55.758 --> 01:02:57.079]  Hey, I'm enjoying what I'm doing.
[01:02:57.099 --> 01:02:58.139]  I wake up with a smile.
[01:02:58.179 --> 01:03:00.120]  I told my wife, I want to be resuscitated.
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.801]  I want to be Darth Vader.
[01:03:01.821 --> 01:03:05.162]  I mean, do not unplug me if I'm going to come over 20 years.
[01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:07.343]  I told her, I want full...
[01:03:08.343 --> 01:03:09.564]  Well, here's the whole thing, though.
[01:03:09.684 --> 01:03:11.086]  We see with the Palfrey case.
[01:03:11.726 --> 01:03:16.010]  It doesn't matter that you go on the air and tell everybody, I will never commit suicide.
[01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:17.391]  They're going to kill you anyway.
[01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:19.272]  Because they think they can cover it up.
[01:03:19.613 --> 01:03:20.874]  They're that bold now.
[01:03:21.234 --> 01:03:26.398]  Here you and I are, right here on national radio and TV, we're saying, we will never kill ourselves.
[01:03:26.679 --> 01:03:28.040]  And people know that.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.081]  But if we're ever suicided,
[01:03:31.055 --> 01:03:32.858]  You know, they don't care!
[01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:39.387]  Even though people are going to remember the fact, hey, I listened to Alex in text that day, they'll never kill themselves, and we never would!
[01:03:39.527 --> 01:03:48.379]  But I mean, I made the joke last week and a month ago, I said they're going to start killing us on TV with them shooting us and say it's suicide, and now they're basically doing that in Houston!
[01:03:48.539 --> 01:03:51.920]  One of the things that happens here is this does create fear.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:57.822]  If they can kill this Palfrey girl, who's had all this visibility, who might they kill?
[01:03:58.142 --> 01:04:06.584]  I mean, if the little people of the world have no chance at all, if they could kill an Alex Jones or a Tex Morris or a Deborah Palfrey, this is the fear.
[01:04:06.684 --> 01:04:17.167]  I think they may even enjoy the fact that a person like Palfrey can say, I would never kill myself, and the next thing you know, they're claiming she committed suicide.
[01:04:17.927 --> 01:04:24.414]  So, I think this is another way of creating this psychological alchemy of fear in the population.
[01:04:24.454 --> 01:04:24.614]  I agree.
[01:04:24.754 --> 01:04:26.376]  Also, the way they hung her in the shed.
[01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.759]  She pulls up under the little carport, little thing outside a trailer.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.242]  They stun gun her, they take her and hang her.
[01:04:32.462 --> 01:04:34.945]  That's their fate, just like they killed the other girl that worked for her.
[01:04:35.645 --> 01:04:37.447]  I mean, what if they killed ten of her girls?
[01:04:38.468 --> 01:04:42.411]  I mean, it just gets more and more, but they do run the risk of losing all credibility.
[01:04:42.431 --> 01:04:45.012]  I mean, Congress has an 11% approval rating, Bush has a 30%.
[01:04:45.593 --> 01:04:46.633]  That's right, that's right.
[01:04:47.114 --> 01:04:52.777]  And here again we go back to this energy situation, to the food situation, to the water situation.
[01:04:53.738 --> 01:04:57.180]  What Americans need to do, what listeners need to do that are hearing us today,
[01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:10.123]  We need to go to the sources of truth, and we need to discover the fact that the world has plenty of oil, plenty of food, plenty of water, and we can get much more through increased technology which we have.
[01:05:10.403 --> 01:05:21.945]  Right now, with the new drilling technology, let me tell you, we can go to the middle of the Atlantic and go down thousands of feet and bring up all the oil that we would ever need for 10,000 years.
[01:05:22.325 --> 01:05:24.225]  And so we need to say, you're lying to us.
[01:05:24.265 --> 01:05:27.166]  Just like with 9-11, we need to prove these people
[01:05:27.666 --> 01:05:30.307]  That they're nothing but a bunch of inveterate liars.
[01:05:30.407 --> 01:05:32.848]  Now once we do that, we can turn things around.
[01:05:33.048 --> 01:05:38.069]  Speaking of new drilling technology, I have a uncle, and they drilled on his property a couple months ago.
[01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:40.110]  16,000 foot well.
[01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.890]  Wow.
[01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.911]  And I mean, it's like the spindle top.
[01:05:43.311 --> 01:05:44.011]  Yeah.
[01:05:44.051 --> 01:05:45.092]  I mean, it is.
[01:05:45.152 --> 01:05:47.312]  That's more than three miles down, you see.
[01:05:47.352 --> 01:05:49.173]  They got a 12 inch pipe on it.
[01:05:50.529 --> 01:06:00.317]  Well, of course, if we do have global warming, then they can just pull those icebergs over to the coast, and there's trillions of barrels of water.
[01:06:00.337 --> 01:06:03.439]  Of course, we have the resources.
[01:06:03.499 --> 01:06:04.340]  People need to understand that.
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.441]  We have the food.
[01:06:05.721 --> 01:06:08.884]  When I was a young man, people were starving in India.
[01:06:09.713 --> 01:06:15.194]  Would you believe that with new agricultural methods and technology, India now feeds itself?
[01:06:15.674 --> 01:06:17.555]  And even exports of rice and such?
[01:06:17.795 --> 01:06:19.315]  Which really makes the globalists mad.
[01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:20.095]  Of course.
[01:06:20.515 --> 01:06:30.877]  So we have incredible amounts of desert land that's being turned into arable, water-driven farmland.
[01:06:31.257 --> 01:06:34.118]  There will always be enough food in the world.
[01:06:34.218 --> 01:06:37.981]  By the way, I've seen a bunch of studies, and they go, those are oil company studies.
[01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:40.583]  No, no, these are studies separate, you know, just studying plants.
[01:06:41.103 --> 01:06:45.007]  Plants will like as much as 14 times higher carbon dioxide.
[01:06:45.407 --> 01:07:00.399]  They use less water, live longer, are healthier, and they're now doing studies showing desertification is in periods with low carbon dioxide, and they're reporting, from my scores going back millions of years, but the really reliable ones, 200,000, this is the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever.
[01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:04.702]  And they're saying it is massively associated with desertification.
[01:07:05.142 --> 01:07:11.907]  And sure enough, because it did spike the last few decades, now it's going to start going back down, suddenly there was more of a greening.
[01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:13.948]  The plants need it.
[01:07:14.348 --> 01:07:18.431]  And then they create more oxygen, which they've now shown that mammals like higher levels.
[01:07:18.671 --> 01:07:20.733]  We're in a starved level right now.
[01:07:21.353 --> 01:07:26.837]  Well, of course, nature will take care of that on its own, without man-made solutions.
[01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:28.038]  Let's go back to this oil.
[01:07:29.605 --> 01:07:35.147]  I mentioned the Bakken oil formation in North and South Dakota, but there's a bigger one.
[01:07:35.668 --> 01:07:49.753]  Out in the Gulf of Mexico in 2004, BP Oil, Exxon Mobil, and another one of the large multinational conglomerates, found the largest reservoir store of oil
[01:07:51.195 --> 01:07:52.857]  Ever found in the United States.
[01:07:52.937 --> 01:07:54.098]  This dwarfs everything.
[01:07:55.079 --> 01:08:01.104]  It means that America will have enough oil for thousands and thousands of years in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:08:01.524 --> 01:08:10.012]  Now when they discovered this in 2004, they said that the oil could begin coming out of that area within a decade.
[01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:10.813]  Within a decade.
[01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:12.054]  That means six years from now.
[01:08:12.494 --> 01:08:16.098]  So you would think the oil futures would already be taking that into account.
[01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:16.578]  Imagine.
[01:08:16.798 --> 01:08:18.300]  Now they say that this is so much oil.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.641]  Well, they've laid most of it off limits.
[01:08:21.342 --> 01:08:26.806]  They found a 600 square mile one off the coast of Louisiana, I know, in the 70s, and then they just said it was a refuge.
[01:08:27.327 --> 01:08:30.009]  Well, the same thing down in Mexico.
[01:08:30.249 --> 01:08:32.191]  Now, I think we're going to see some lies.
[01:08:32.211 --> 01:08:34.332]  There's going to be reasons why they can't get that oil.
[01:08:34.653 --> 01:08:41.518]  For example, Mexico, you know, Pemex, the oil company down there, they have been keeping that oil in the ground.
[01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:42.919]  Mexico,
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.080]  Three times the resources we have, though.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.841]  They don't want them to have money down there.
[01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:48.301]  Why don't we bring oil out of Alaska?
[01:09:06.867 --> 01:09:07.548]  We're out of time.
[01:09:07.588 --> 01:09:09.290]  It is such an honor to have you here.
[01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:15.396]  Please plug how people get a copy of Days of Hunger, Days of Pain, Days of Chaos.
[01:09:15.696 --> 01:09:19.661]  Please plug how they get one of your free newsletters, how they get a Codex Magicka.
[01:09:19.681 --> 01:09:20.361]  Give them your number.
[01:09:20.702 --> 01:09:21.482]  Give them your websites.
[01:09:21.903 --> 01:09:23.765]  Alex, powerofprophecy.com.
[01:09:24.065 --> 01:09:26.407]  Power of Prophecy dot com.
[01:09:26.427 --> 01:09:27.568]  They can get these things on the internet.
[01:09:27.808 --> 01:09:34.453]  By the way, we'll give them a free subscription if they write to us at 1708 Patterson Road, Austin, Texas, 78733.
[01:09:35.074 --> 01:09:39.677]  Hey, to get that free subscription, also just call toll-free 1-800-PROPHECY.
[01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:45.183]  234-9673, a free issue of Power of Prophecy Newsletter.
[01:09:45.623 --> 01:09:54.513]  And next month I'm going to talk more in my newsletter about these contrived, chaotic crises and how we can overcome the lies of the elite.
[01:09:54.553 --> 01:09:54.873]  That's right.
[01:09:54.893 --> 01:09:56.635]  You have a free newsletter that's just amazing.
[01:09:56.695 --> 01:10:00.599]  Also, you have a radio show once a week that airs, what, three or four times on WWCR?
[01:10:01.019 --> 01:10:06.986]  WWCR, and of course we have it audio streaming 24-7 there on PowerOfProphecy.com.
[01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:08.267]  But I want to encourage people to call 1-800-234-9673.
[01:10:08.367 --> 01:10:12.892]  And all they have to do is say, hey, send me that free newsletter.
[01:10:13.092 --> 01:10:14.153]  We'll be glad to do it.
[01:10:14.193 --> 01:10:18.718]  Give it out, and a lot of hardcore issues, all neurotically well researched.
[01:10:18.738 --> 01:10:21.401]  You're very, just like me, you really try to get to all the facts.
[01:10:21.721 --> 01:10:22.542]  Give them the number again.
[01:10:22.982 --> 01:10:28.386]  Okay, that's toll-free, 1-800-234-9673.
[01:10:28.566 --> 01:10:32.608]  And they'll know the truth about this hoax called the Age of Scarcity.
[01:10:32.969 --> 01:10:38.252]  This new reality, this new psychological alchemy that they're pushing down on us.
[01:10:38.332 --> 01:10:39.673]  Do not accept it, folks!
[01:10:40.173 --> 01:10:40.754]  Say no!
[01:10:41.174 --> 01:10:42.034]  Just say no!
[01:10:42.495 --> 01:10:45.737]  Just like 9-11, we're not going to accept the official version.
[01:10:45.777 --> 01:10:47.698]  This is a planet of plenty.
[01:10:48.218 --> 01:10:50.020]  It is not a planet of scarcity.
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:11:04.023]  Again, powerofprophecy.com, texamars.com, the book, Days of Hunger, Days of Chaos, the GMO foods, the control of food, all of it, the coming great food shortages in America, written nine years ago, more important now than ever, the number again, Tex.
[01:11:04.503 --> 01:11:06.103]  Okay, toll free, 1-800-234-9673.
[01:11:06.703 --> 01:11:11.144]  Of course, we have a lot of free things there.
[01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:14.825]  My newest book, by the way, is Codex Magic, and I know it's available.
[01:11:15.285 --> 01:11:20.750]  Well, I don't care where they get it from at all, because it's not a matter of money.
[01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:22.671]  This is a matter of life and truth.
[01:11:22.691 --> 01:11:23.672]  Tex, you are the best, my friend.
[01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:24.053]  Thank you.
[01:11:24.193 --> 01:11:24.653]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:11:24.693 --> 01:11:25.194]  All right.
[01:11:25.274 --> 01:11:30.238]  We'll, for about one minute here, say bye to everybody in overdrive here.
[01:11:30.818 --> 01:11:33.261]  Tex, really great having you on with us.
[01:11:33.341 --> 01:11:36.984]  And I know you're a very busy man, but I'd like to every couple of months have you in here.
[01:11:37.324 --> 01:11:37.844]  Hey, I'd like that.
[01:11:37.864 --> 01:11:39.366]  And I want you on my radio program, too.
[01:11:39.766 --> 01:11:41.547]  Because everything is coming to a head now.
[01:11:41.908 --> 01:11:45.250]  We're seeing the cauldron just boiling now.
[01:11:45.711 --> 01:11:47.572]  And people are desperate for truth.
[01:11:47.812 --> 01:11:48.533]  And let's give it to them.
[01:11:49.033 --> 01:11:49.634]  Absolutely.
[01:11:49.974 --> 01:11:50.835]  God bless you, Tex Moyes.
[01:11:50.995 --> 01:11:51.815]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:11:52.276 --> 01:11:52.816]  He's awesome.
[01:11:53.036 --> 01:11:53.337]  All right.
[01:11:53.357 --> 01:11:54.638]  We'll be right back in three minutes, folks.
[01:11:56.519 --> 01:11:56.919]  Hey, Jones.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:58.361]  Yes?
[01:11:58.841 --> 01:11:59.962]  I have your guest.
[01:12:00.242 --> 01:12:00.382]  Good.
[01:12:00.402 --> 01:12:00.903]  Let's go to him.
[01:12:01.603 --> 01:12:01.843]  Okay.
[01:12:01.923 --> 01:12:02.744]  Thank you.
[01:12:02.764 --> 01:12:04.225]  He was set up for 1 p.m.
[01:12:04.525 --> 01:12:04.966]  Yeah, I know.
[01:12:05.386 --> 01:12:06.267]  We moved him and he knows it.
[01:12:07.665 --> 01:12:09.726]  Okay, so he was just holding willingly?
[01:12:09.746 --> 01:12:12.527]  I guess nobody told Hoffman.
[01:12:12.827 --> 01:12:16.568]  Yeah, no one told him.
[01:12:17.108 --> 01:12:19.569]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:12:20.289 --> 01:12:27.612]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:35.621]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:12:36.082 --> 01:12:39.564]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:42.426]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:12:42.526 --> 01:12:43.667]  Most people have no idea.
[01:12:43.687 --> 01:12:44.447]  They're not after money.
[01:12:44.467 --> 01:12:45.548]  They have all the money they need.
[01:12:45.748 --> 01:12:46.449]  They're after power.
[01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:47.569]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:56.115]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:56.595 --> 01:12:58.897]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:12:59.397 --> 01:13:00.458]  You have been warned.
[01:13:01.499 --> 01:13:02.860]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:06.623]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[01:13:06.763 --> 01:13:12.688]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[01:13:12.808 --> 01:13:16.572]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:20.275]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[01:13:20.475 --> 01:13:21.376]  Liberty of conscience.
[01:13:21.636 --> 01:13:26.099]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:30.042]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:32.764]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[01:13:32.964 --> 01:13:38.067]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[01:13:38.267 --> 01:13:41.650]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:44.572]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:47.254]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:49.195]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[01:13:49.395 --> 01:13:50.735]  Jesus is coming soon!

[01:14:14.182 --> 01:14:18.003]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.

[01:14:25.247 --> 01:14:28.429]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:14:28.649 --> 01:14:36.154]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:16:09.146 --> 01:16:13.609]  All right, we're going to have Michael Hoffman on with us for the next two hours.
[01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:15.390]  He's been gracious enough to move back 20 minutes.
[01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:16.790]  This is the Paltry Murder.
[01:16:17.091 --> 01:16:19.292]  He'll be with us 20 minutes into overdrive.
[01:16:19.312 --> 01:16:32.099]  I want to take our time here today and attempt to not throw in my points and added things and back up what he's saying, but really riveting, important information to understand the world we live in and how the nature of reality has been hidden from us in false...
[01:16:33.099 --> 01:16:36.321]  Images and false maps have been downloaded into our minds.
[01:16:37.381 --> 01:16:41.564]  He is an alternative historian, award-winning, a former AP writer based in New York.
[01:16:42.304 --> 01:16:45.105]  He's written some books that have been best-sellers, very well-received.
[01:16:45.666 --> 01:16:48.747]  And we're going to break down a whole host of issues, the cornucopia.
[01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:55.271]  I want to start at the beginning today and go back to the roots of this, go through it all with our guest today.
[01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:57.452]  Thank you for coming on with us, Mr. Hoffman.
[01:16:58.049 --> 01:17:00.290]  Thank you Alex.
[01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:05.032]  This is a short segment, we'll come back in a long one, but just begin wherever you like, whatever you think is most important.
[01:17:05.252 --> 01:17:17.098]  If you were talking to a new audience, which most of my listeners are for you, and trying to explain it to an informed population, but also people that may not have a full understanding.
[01:17:17.984 --> 01:17:20.887]  Well, I think I'd like to go back to what we discussed last time.
[01:17:20.947 --> 01:17:26.031]  You raised an issue, and then I heard a commercial on the program that set off something in my mind.
[01:17:26.612 --> 01:17:28.934]  And you mentioned, you said, where is it?
[01:17:29.014 --> 01:17:30.034]  Who's responsible?
[01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:35.199]  Where do we trace this cryptocracy, this conspiracy, up to the top?
[01:17:35.962 --> 01:17:38.383]  And you said, is it a German conspiracy?
[01:17:38.603 --> 01:17:47.185]  And then there was an add-on saying that we were headed to a papal America, that whenever church and state are united, that brings about tyranny.
[01:17:47.345 --> 01:17:48.245]  Is it a Zionist?
[01:17:48.405 --> 01:17:49.725]  Is it a... Yeah.
[01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:58.787]  When I hear that, I realize that there's more confusion out there than I even realized, because I think we have to follow a trail in the West.
[01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:04.489]  And what my remarks today will be about Western civilization, the cryptocracy as it operates in the West.
[01:18:05.663 --> 01:18:07.224]  Now I want to be clear, I want to stop you though.
[01:18:07.584 --> 01:18:09.765]  I don't have confusion about this.
[01:18:10.446 --> 01:18:18.591]  We're all broken though into subgroups fighting over which group runs it with most of our collective energies and the movement spent on that.
[01:18:18.731 --> 01:18:20.191]  I don't do that, you don't do that.
[01:18:20.592 --> 01:18:27.155]  I understand it's a methodology that infects all the major groups, but with some core groups operating, I just want to be clear for the audience.
[01:18:28.056 --> 01:18:34.780]  Well, you know, I see that when we're trying to find a way of ameliorating the cancer plague
[01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:42.304]  And one of the ways that the system keeps us from doing that is they plant the idea that everything causes cancer, so why bother?
[01:18:42.644 --> 01:18:54.593]  When we're dealing with the assassination of President Kennedy and we're trying to bring the criminal masterminds who were behind that to justice, one of the ways they obstruct us is they plant the idea that everybody killed Kennedy.
[01:18:54.633 --> 01:18:58.416]  It was the communists, it was the anti-communists, it was the CIA, it was the KGB.
[01:18:59.378 --> 01:19:13.090]  So when we have these agents of confusion sowing this, some of it is honest confusion of course, not everyone is an agent, but when the agents of disinformation or confusion are out there, we can't begin to proceed from first principles.
[01:19:13.471 --> 01:19:18.335]  And I find so many people are in difficulty because they're not proceeding from first principles.
[01:19:18.815 --> 01:19:20.598]  So, for me, the first principle is...
[01:19:34.079 --> 01:19:40.621]  That Rosicrucians use magic to drop A-bombs, he believes the Earth is on a string, and that the universe orbits it.
[01:19:40.661 --> 01:19:52.143]  I mean, these people, some of them are so kooky, but they demand that you agree with them, and so I just want to be clear that I don't agree with a lot of the groups that are out there saying this group or that group runs it all.
[01:19:52.343 --> 01:19:52.943]  That's my point.
[01:19:53.784 --> 01:19:54.164]  I see.
[01:19:54.644 --> 01:19:59.965]  Well, and by the way, who are you referring to when you say the Grand Poobah of the Catholics?
[01:20:00.555 --> 01:20:02.938]  Well, no, no, no, of the Catholics run it all crowd.
[01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.139]  I don't even want to say his name.
[01:20:04.159 --> 01:20:08.004]  It's just, I don't even think most his minions know that he believes all this insanity.
[01:20:08.024 --> 01:20:19.518]  Right, because one of the things I noticed in the ad is they said they associated, they created a proprietary relationship between church and state and the papacy.
[01:20:20.097 --> 01:20:29.284]  And actually, the United States of America was formed in revolt against an Anglican church in this state, which had united in Great Britain... Well, let's be clear.
[01:20:29.444 --> 01:20:29.904]  Let's be clear.
[01:20:30.004 --> 01:20:33.467]  I don't endorse the ads on this network unless you hear my voice endorsing it.
[01:20:33.487 --> 01:20:34.648]  I have no control over that.
[01:20:35.128 --> 01:20:35.849]  But go ahead.
[01:20:36.793 --> 01:20:52.248]  Well, and so, I mean, just very briefly, the Anglicans were operating a union between church and state, and one of the reasons I know that is when I was researching the biography of the first Roman Catholic Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roger B. Taney,
[01:20:53.008 --> 01:20:57.031]  And he talked about when he was a child, he was banned from going to Catholic school.
[01:20:57.091 --> 01:21:01.174]  He was born just slightly before the onset of the American Revolution.
[01:21:01.654 --> 01:21:09.239]  And once the American Revolution was a success, almost immediately, his parents were allowed to send him to the school of his choice.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:13.882]  So, it's just one example of the anomalies of history, and either we're accurate... Stay there!
[01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:14.243]  Stay there!
[01:21:14.263 --> 01:21:16.784]  We're going to talk during the break, and we're going to continue on the other side.
[01:21:16.804 --> 01:21:17.205]  Stay with me.
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:19.640]  We're on the march.
[01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.441]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:21:21.461 --> 01:21:23.182]  I'm going to keep Mr. Hopman up.
[01:21:23.542 --> 01:21:26.963]  Mr. Hopman, what we're going to do is, I'm going to skip some of the breaks.
[01:21:27.043 --> 01:21:28.543]  Now AM and FM's won't hear you.
[01:21:29.744 --> 01:21:30.704]  Shortwave won't hear you.
[01:21:30.744 --> 01:21:34.425]  But huge internet audiences and huge internet TV audiences will.
[01:21:34.665 --> 01:21:37.226]  And the archiving of some of these breaks will let you break.
[01:21:37.506 --> 01:21:39.107]  Some breaks we're going to talk straight through.
[01:21:40.087 --> 01:21:45.029]  So, I want to continue the discussion during some of the breaks, okay?
[01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:46.129]  Okay, Alex.
[01:21:46.409 --> 01:21:46.629]  Great.
[01:21:46.649 --> 01:21:48.150]  And guys at the network, please close your mic.
[01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.610]  Okay.
[01:21:50.630 --> 01:21:52.491]  Now, I don't want to make this too confusing from the start.
[01:21:52.511 --> 01:21:53.971]  You can talk about whatever group you want.
[01:21:54.271 --> 01:21:55.591]  Say what you truly believe.
[01:21:56.251 --> 01:21:57.852]  Feel free to say whatever you want, Mr. Hoffman.
[01:21:57.872 --> 01:21:58.692]  I want to be clear about that.
[01:21:58.952 --> 01:22:07.274]  But I was confused in the last segment about ads, and then it clicked in my mind about some Catholics Run It All ad that runs on the network.
[01:22:08.054 --> 01:22:09.755]  Of course, I'm not a Catholic.
[01:22:09.795 --> 01:22:10.816]  I'm not a Catholic apologist.
[01:22:10.856 --> 01:22:12.637]  I just think it's exaggerated, their power.
[01:22:12.657 --> 01:22:14.719]  I think you're part of the New World Order, like every other big thing.
[01:22:15.439 --> 01:22:21.763]  So, let me just get some kind of idea, and this is on air right now, because I haven't done a pre-interview with you.
[01:22:21.823 --> 01:22:22.724]  I don't really do those.
[01:22:23.044 --> 01:22:25.485]  Tell me what it is you want to cover in the two hours we've got.
[01:22:26.366 --> 01:22:29.688]  Well, I would like to cover my main thesis right now.
[01:22:29.728 --> 01:22:30.689]  I'm just finishing up.
[01:22:30.789 --> 01:22:36.032]  I'm indexing a nearly 1,000 page book on Judaism called Judaism Discovered.
[01:22:36.747 --> 01:22:51.347]  And so obviously that would be the source and focus of what I want to talk about today, although I realize I've written other books and I know you're interested in the epistemology of the cryptocracy as I've elucidated it in my book, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare.
[01:22:51.527 --> 01:23:02.132]  That's the system they use, and my only point is that school of thought is used by others, though you could argue they're the masters in the primitive group, the strand that binds it all.
[01:23:02.392 --> 01:23:04.633]  And so I'd like to hear your view and your research on that.
[01:23:04.893 --> 01:23:15.638]  With two hours, then let's just get into the Judaism first for an hour, and then let's do an hour on all of their different methods and sorceries.
[01:23:16.178 --> 01:23:19.860]  Right, and the other thing I'd like to say to you, Alex, is feel free to challenge me
[01:23:20.758 --> 01:23:28.065]  If you think that there's something I'm saying that's erroneous, I find that it makes for a much more interesting conversation.
[01:23:28.186 --> 01:23:28.766]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:23:28.826 --> 01:23:32.350]  I'm going to have to physically restrain myself not to add points and jump in.
[01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:36.514]  But I have to tell you, sir, I researched the stuff you're putting out, the information you're putting out.
[01:23:36.954 --> 01:23:41.137]  And I think on the whole it's accurate only because I'm somewhat of a history buff in my own right.
[01:23:41.177 --> 01:23:53.346]  It's so wide and deep that we're all novices really, but I've just found so much of what I've read you've written that I already discovered separately in multiple other texts that weren't even political in nature.
[01:23:53.686 --> 01:23:55.968]  So I have to agree with your overall view and analysis.
[01:23:57.028 --> 01:24:12.519]  I may disagree in the approach to the public, and also I believe that the globalists are also controlling much of the anti-Judaism movement and putting it out in a way that actually only empowers some of the more dangerous varieties there.
[01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:20.584]  And of course you know the old European tool of using some of the Zionists as their fronts, before it was known as Zionist, going back a thousand years ago.
[01:24:20.724 --> 01:24:23.346]  So I believe it's kind of a hybrid amalgamation.
[01:24:23.846 --> 01:24:25.928]  But listen, you've got the floor, we're going live right now.
[01:24:26.608 --> 01:24:26.828]  Yeah.
[01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:27.289]  Here we go.
[01:24:27.349 --> 01:24:27.709]  Here we go.
[01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.210]  Here we go, sir.
[01:24:39.339 --> 01:24:43.343]  Every move the new old order makes, every breath they take, we'll be there.
[01:24:43.963 --> 01:24:48.387]  Covering every subject, every issue, going to the Veritas.
[01:24:49.108 --> 01:24:50.269]  Trying to find the truth.
[01:24:51.089 --> 01:24:53.932]  Trying to question the box within a box that we all live in.
[01:24:56.864 --> 01:24:59.786]  Alright, Michael Hoffman is our guest.
[01:24:59.846 --> 01:25:10.852]  Michael, before we go any further, tell us in a nutshell a little bit about yourself, your awakening for a minute or two, your website, your books, and then we're going to go for two hours pretty much straight here with only a few breaks.
[01:25:10.892 --> 01:25:11.212]  Go ahead.
[01:25:11.932 --> 01:25:22.418]  The website is www.revisionisthistory.org and we're located in North Idaho, PO Box 849, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 83816.
[01:25:25.025 --> 01:25:29.648]  I was fortunate enough to have been born to a revisionist historian grandfather.
[01:25:29.728 --> 01:25:31.169]  He was a lay historian.
[01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:38.834]  He wasn't a professional, but he had a great deal of skepticism about the mainline story of history.
[01:25:38.934 --> 01:25:47.920]  So I was basically sitting on his knee from a young age, hearing him talking about things like, for example, that Joseph P. Kennedy had stolen
[01:25:48.499 --> 01:26:06.416]  The election in 1960 for his son through the Chicago Mafia and I was hearing this practically as a toddler so I suppose I've been predestined for this line of inquiry for being a skeptic for always questioning and doubting and as John Milton said
[01:26:07.054 --> 01:26:18.001]  In the 17th century, give me the right to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience above all other liberties, and that's what I've tried to live and what I've tried to extend to others, Alex.
[01:26:18.161 --> 01:26:19.722]  Now let me just throw out something here.
[01:26:19.882 --> 01:26:24.505]  It's become a thought crime to say that CO2 is a deadly poison.
[01:26:25.785 --> 01:26:28.347]  to say that sodium chloride isn't deadly poison.
[01:26:29.108 --> 01:26:41.457]  It has become a thought crime to even question official stories, official history, but questioning Debra Jean Palfrey's clear murder, when we now have another eerie flashback.
[01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:41.797]  D.C.
[01:26:41.837 --> 01:26:44.499]  Madam said, I'll never want my life to end in suicide.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:51.505]  She not only said that here on this show, in May 2007 for an interview for Carol Joyt, host of Q&A Cafe TV show,
[01:26:52.265 --> 01:26:52.325]  I'm
[01:27:07.142 --> 01:27:07.942]  Okay, Mr. Hoffman, go ahead.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:47.105]  Well, and this particular questionable death that you're referring to reminds me as far back as Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, who a lot of us believe was tossed out of a window and they claim that that was suicide.
[01:27:47.145 --> 01:27:54.288]  And of course the secrets and the knowledge that he was sitting on were absolutely cataclysmic in terms of what he might have or could have revealed.
[01:27:54.668 --> 01:28:00.810]  So they certainly have a long history of doing this, but I'm not privy to the details of this particular case.
[01:28:01.511 --> 01:28:01.791]  But, um,
[01:28:03.113 --> 01:28:17.181]  Lately, since the year 2000, I have been consumed with my research on Judaism and on Zionism and the Talmudic religion, because I feel that it's the key to understanding the cryptocracy as a whole.
[01:28:17.781 --> 01:28:27.326]  And during the break, you had mentioned to me that you also feel there are some aspects of anti-Judaism which are problematic, and I would agree with that insofar as I believe that
[01:28:27.918 --> 01:28:39.013]  The Cryptocracy plants their own Agence Provocateur inside various groups and then they take extreme positions which actually benefit Judaism.
[01:28:39.093 --> 01:28:41.777]  One of the prime ways that they benefit Judaism is
[01:28:42.202 --> 01:28:45.783]  Whenever you have race hate injected into this discussion.
[01:28:46.643 --> 01:29:08.588]  And the Zionist documents going back 200 years say that it compacts their group and then they feed on the lower Jews beneath them and the Jews think that their leaders are taking care of them when Israel admittedly has been caught doing bombings in Baghdad 60-something years ago, bombings in southern Spain, all of these things to drive Jews back to their homeland.
[01:29:09.088 --> 01:29:13.189]  Well, Judaics are the first victims of Judaism.
[01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:25.473]  That's something that has to be understood, is that the freedom movement that I'm leading here with regard to Judaism is first an attempt to liberate individual Judaics from Judaism.
[01:29:25.953 --> 01:29:35.976]  And so you disagree with the main line of the crazies that say Jews are really Neanderthals and crazies that go around stirring up trouble and making people look stupid that talk about this.
[01:29:36.357 --> 01:29:37.177]  You disagree.
[01:29:37.217 --> 01:29:40.018]  You're saying you don't believe they're inherently devil-seed.
[01:29:40.939 --> 01:29:49.562]  Yeah, this reptilian idea and all of that, what it really means is it means that Jesus Christ was wrong and that people can't be converted.
[01:29:50.003 --> 01:29:54.704]  If someone is inherently the seed of the devil, all you can do is exterminate them.
[01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:56.065]  You cannot convert them.
[01:29:56.425 --> 01:30:00.947]  So you can see the occult root to that, and you can see the black evil that's behind that.
[01:30:01.127 --> 01:30:25.875]  Well, that's my point, is that, you know, fifteen years studying this, every time I met somebody who said it was the Jews, the Jews, they were lying, backstabbing, crazy, lying scum, who would always attack me, and then I'm like, my God, the people that believe this must be bad, because everybody I meet is, but I guess they're provocateurs, or crazies, or losers who want to blame a group, but just because they're doing that doesn't mean
[01:30:26.195 --> 01:30:28.236]  This isn't a predatory group out of control.
[01:30:29.196 --> 01:30:35.398]  Well, it's a predatory ideology which is out of control, but there's another factor here, and that is, who is a Jew?
[01:30:35.918 --> 01:30:46.082]  I mean, people run around calling themselves Jews, and in John Chapter 8, Jesus said that they had as their father the Father of Life, so why do we believe them?
[01:30:46.582 --> 01:30:51.704]  All of the genealogical records were destroyed when the Romans conquered Jerusalem in A.D.
[01:30:51.784 --> 01:30:53.044]  70, so we only have the word
[01:30:55.625 --> 01:31:00.449]  of these rabbinic liars to say that they're descended from King David or Abraham.
[01:31:00.490 --> 01:31:07.075]  You and I may have more Abrahamic blood in our veins than they do, but my question and my challenge to them is prove it.
[01:31:07.456 --> 01:31:09.257]  Prove that you're descended from Judah.
[01:31:09.277 --> 01:31:17.144]  Well, they've done the DNA test and they know that about 82% of people claiming to be Jews are actually Central Eastern European, um, Khazars.
[01:31:17.204 --> 01:31:20.086]  And that's, people call me all the time like they found some new secret.
[01:31:20.367 --> 01:31:22.749]  I remember reading that when I was 10 years old in Mainline History.
[01:31:23.484 --> 01:31:23.685]  Right.
[01:31:23.965 --> 01:31:31.740]  So what that also does though, it's interesting because it absolves these interlopers from actually being the biblical Jews.
[01:31:32.324 --> 01:31:49.069]  They don't have any kind of a curse on them, although I believe even when we are talking about actual Israel, and certainly there is a remnant of Israel on the earth, as scripture says, but that curse was only on the few generations there, the early generations that would have been implicated in the death of Christ.
[01:31:49.169 --> 01:31:54.271]  It certainly wouldn't correspond to any actual biological Jew who was alive today.
[01:31:54.671 --> 01:32:00.713]  But this racial issue, Alex, one of the things that we have to understand here is, is that the rabbis
[01:32:01.153 --> 01:32:05.076]  ...are very keen on keeping Judaics inside the ranks.
[01:32:05.557 --> 01:32:13.403]  So they have to use the Hitlers, the Nazis, and the haters to scare the Judaic people back into the fold of Judaism.
[01:32:13.423 --> 01:32:25.353]  Because one of the things that Judaism teaches in the Talmud is, is that no matter how nice, how good, how benevolent a Gentile is towards you, he's only doing it for ulterior, cynical motives.
[01:32:25.394 --> 01:32:28.156]  He can never really love you for yourself.
[01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:53.003]  And a corollary from that, if I may expand on this, is the idea that if someone attacks the Israeli government, if they say they're genocidal, they're instituting a holocaust against the Palestinians, if they say, like Walt and Mershimer do in their book on the Israeli lobby, that there's inordinate power and control of the United States government on the part of the Israeli lobby,
[01:32:53.443 --> 01:33:01.727]  The reaction of the main hardcore of Orthodox Judaism and Zionism is to say, you know, that's inherently anti-Semitic.
[01:33:02.188 --> 01:33:04.469]  You don't really have a valid point.
[01:33:04.789 --> 01:33:08.971]  What you're motivated by is hatred and bias towards us.
[01:33:09.571 --> 01:33:10.932]  And of course... Exactly!
[01:33:11.032 --> 01:33:16.895]  I mean, if you... and people always say, well, I don't hate Jews, I just hate Zionists.
[01:33:16.915 --> 01:33:22.058]  But now those guys have all flipped and are saying, I do hate Jews, it is the Jews.
[01:33:22.738 --> 01:33:26.882]  Well then if they're saying that, Alex, they're falling right into the rabbi's trap.
[01:33:26.942 --> 01:33:40.434]  I know, I've read the official documents they wrote where they said, isn't it wonderful, we'll get people to persecute us, we'll even commit horrible crimes and let the Gentiles find out so they'll persecute us so we can then have our little slaves under us and not letting Hitler
[01:33:41.275 --> 01:33:45.338]  Kick the Jews out saying no, they have to come to Palestine, they've got to pay us money.
[01:33:45.779 --> 01:33:48.621]  One cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in Germany.
[01:33:49.101 --> 01:33:56.407]  I mean, you know, these sickening evil statements, these types of things, all I'm saying is it's a lot more sophisticated.
[01:33:56.967 --> 01:33:58.649]  Let me digress and then we'll get back into this.
[01:33:59.349 --> 01:34:06.016]  Why is there such an obsession with Germanic-ness by the modern Zionist?
[01:34:06.357 --> 01:34:11.883]  Why do we see the Rothschilds funding different German institutes of eugenics?
[01:34:12.223 --> 01:34:13.704]  Why do we see them funding it now?
[01:34:13.825 --> 01:34:16.708]  Why are they intermarried with European Germanics?
[01:34:18.909 --> 01:34:22.771]  Why are they supporting Schwarzenegger wearing his Nazi belt buckle in public?
[01:34:23.092 --> 01:34:30.616]  I mean, certainly you see that there's a weird, satanic wedding going on behind the scenes, or you disagree with that?
[01:34:31.337 --> 01:34:39.482]  Well, I would say that there's some of that going on, but it's a complex issue because it's more behind the scenes, overtly in public.
[01:34:40.362 --> 01:34:44.985]  They have impressed upon the German people the mark of Cain, a hereditary stigma
[01:34:45.535 --> 01:34:48.076]  Which is a form of mental colonization.
[01:34:48.116 --> 01:34:49.537]  The Germans internalized this.
[01:34:49.557 --> 01:34:52.178]  They have one of the lowest birth rates and highest suicide rates.
[01:34:52.218 --> 01:34:54.739]  And they did that to blacks, too, with the transatlantic slave trade.
[01:34:55.619 --> 01:34:56.320]  Well, they did that.
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:34:59.241]  They had them internalize that they weren't humans or they were bad.
[01:34:59.281 --> 01:35:01.782]  They were Cain or Ham, right?
[01:35:02.422 --> 01:35:08.725]  Yeah, as we talked about in the last program, they gave them this notion that they were hereditary slaves.
[01:35:09.425 --> 01:35:11.706]  And that that was a part of a taint there.
[01:35:12.595 --> 01:35:14.877]  I'm getting an echo on the line here all of a sudden.
[01:35:14.897 --> 01:35:17.278]  I don't know if that's just at my end or your end.
[01:35:17.298 --> 01:35:18.559]  We're not getting it on the network.
[01:35:18.599 --> 01:35:19.620]  Network, are you getting that hum?
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:20.861]  Nope, nothing.
[01:35:20.901 --> 01:35:21.861]  I'm not hearing anything, sir.
[01:35:22.082 --> 01:35:22.622]  Okay, great.
[01:35:22.642 --> 01:35:23.943]  I'll just proceed then.
[01:35:24.583 --> 01:35:28.626]  And so what I would say is that I see a cleavage between this
[01:35:29.150 --> 01:35:36.371]  The idea that there is sort of a secret linkage between the Germanic elite and the elite of the cryptocracy.
[01:35:36.411 --> 01:35:37.652]  Well, let me stop you right there.
[01:35:37.912 --> 01:35:45.953]  I mean, 80 plus billion dollars in the last four years from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with Warren Buffett, and they're in Africa injecting them with HIV.
[01:35:46.153 --> 01:35:46.894]  They're poisoning them.
[01:35:46.914 --> 01:35:47.514]  They've been caught.
[01:35:47.574 --> 01:35:48.494]  It's in the documents.
[01:35:48.734 --> 01:35:50.354]  They've been caught carrying out eugenics.
[01:35:50.794 --> 01:35:54.455]  I mean, that I would call Hitler-esque.
[01:35:54.695 --> 01:35:58.176]  But if the Judaics run it, I guess they want all the blacks and Asians dead too, or what?
[01:35:59.423 --> 01:36:04.149]  Well, that's a little bit outside my competence in terms of discussing this issue at hand.
[01:36:04.169 --> 01:36:17.325]  But I mean, that's what I'm saying, though, is that the Darwinistic view, the Francis Galton view, I mean, when I get to the head of the Human Genome Project, Dr. Watson, saying blacks basically weren't human.
[01:36:17.725 --> 01:36:22.847]  You know, he's a white guy, and he's running the Human Genome Project, running around saying blacks aren't human.
[01:36:22.867 --> 01:36:33.471]  I'm saying, you know, I understand in the media and everywhere else you can see the Zionists, but I'm saying, when I get into science, and I get into foundations, and I get into this, I mean, it's Hitlerian, it's eugenics.
[01:36:33.711 --> 01:36:37.212]  I'm saying I've really found that, and I've really found Zionists everywhere, too.
[01:36:37.492 --> 01:36:43.594]  So what I'm saying is... It's Hitlerian, but Hitler is an anomaly in terms of German civilization.
[01:36:43.614 --> 01:36:45.235]  It would be like saying that George Bush
[01:36:45.715 --> 01:36:50.837]  Is a typical product of our American civilization... No, but when I say Germanic, I don't mean even the German people.
[01:36:50.897 --> 01:36:52.978]  I'm talking about Germanic occultism.
[01:36:54.018 --> 01:36:57.260]  And I'm not attacking Germans, I'm saying that there is a relish.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:04.002]  The eugenicists, the British eugenicists, Rothschild-funded eugenics institutions worship the Germanic form.
[01:37:06.123 --> 01:37:10.505]  Well, I would say... There's something else here, something more here is what I'm saying.
[01:37:11.010 --> 01:37:17.032]  I don't see any larger role in the occult for the Germans than for any other of the European people.
[01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:19.052]  But you know, Germanic means wider.
[01:37:19.072 --> 01:37:24.714]  I mean, Germanic is the main fulcrum in that entire region, even into northern France.
[01:37:25.554 --> 01:37:36.477]  Well, they certainly always wanted to control the Germans, but prior to the rise of Hitler, Germany and German civilization was a paragon of the music of Bach and Beethoven and
[01:37:37.239 --> 01:37:44.262]  The great philosophy and the advances in religion and science, which we owe so much to the Germans.
[01:37:44.742 --> 01:37:46.543]  Pharmacologicals, everything.
[01:37:47.043 --> 01:37:52.625]  I mean, there is a role in the early Ordo Templi Orientis of the O.T.O.
[01:37:52.665 --> 01:37:56.227]  There is a German connection there, and there's a German connection to skull and bones.
[01:37:56.767 --> 01:38:00.409]  But if we were to talk about the British, and again, that wouldn't be an indictment of the O.T.O.
[01:38:00.489 --> 01:38:02.290]  I'm saying the British are the absolute heart.
[01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:05.111]  I'm just saying, why do they, as a fetish,
[01:38:06.004 --> 01:38:08.566]  You know, get into the Gutter Dammerung and all of that.
[01:38:08.606 --> 01:38:09.547]  Look, it doesn't matter.
[01:38:09.567 --> 01:38:26.020]  The point is... Well, you know, it's interesting though, Alex, because they say that people who are in the know tell me that when you go to these collection catalogs for Nazi memorabilia and Nazi relics, that the number of Judaic customers on there is astonishing.
[01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:30.024]  No, no, that's... And perhaps you use the appropriate word, perhaps it's a fetish.
[01:38:31.601 --> 01:38:33.882]  Yeah, no, I'm just, I mean, I really study this stuff.
[01:38:33.902 --> 01:38:34.902]  I really want the truth.
[01:38:35.442 --> 01:38:37.723]  And I'm just saying, I've knocked down the hidden doors.
[01:38:37.763 --> 01:38:40.204]  I've gone, burrowed into the deepest pits.
[01:38:40.364 --> 01:38:45.946]  And I mean, I find a bunch of weird, druidic, don't even call it Germanic.
[01:38:46.026 --> 01:38:50.548]  I see all of Northern Europe and, you know, Britannia as Germanic.
[01:38:51.328 --> 01:38:52.969]  Visigothian, whatever you want to call it.
[01:38:53.009 --> 01:38:58.251]  So I think when I use the term German, I'm not talking about the last, you know, Bismarckian Imperial Germany.
[01:38:58.291 --> 01:38:59.472]  But look, I digress.
[01:38:59.512 --> 01:39:00.052]  Just, you know what?
[01:39:00.956 --> 01:39:03.938]  I may even have to go out of the room, because this stuff gets me thinking so much.
[01:39:04.038 --> 01:39:04.879]  I'll just let you finish.
[01:39:04.899 --> 01:39:05.419]  Just go ahead.
[01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:14.506]  Well, Hitler used a good luck symbol, the swastika, which prior to the rise of his regime was always universally associated with good luck.
[01:39:15.006 --> 01:39:17.728]  All it is is the symbol of the sun in motion.
[01:39:17.768 --> 01:39:25.794]  You put a cross inside of a wheel, you knock four segments of it out, and it looks like a running man or an intimation of the sun.
[01:39:27.305 --> 01:39:33.808]  A pagan symbol always associated generically with good luck and he twisted it into this horrible thing.
[01:39:34.408 --> 01:39:51.715]  I think in general there is a magnetic archetype associated with the northern European model both racially and in terms of some of the things that we see in our movies and culture as far as these associations with the polar regions and with the sword and sorcery epics.
[01:39:52.075 --> 01:39:54.396]  So it wouldn't surprise me if at some level
[01:39:55.152 --> 01:39:55.513]  I think so.
[01:40:12.077 --> 01:40:12.157]  It's
[01:40:27.057 --> 01:40:33.501]  Oh no, I mean there's no doubt that Madonna and all of it, I mean it's everywhere, the symbolism, no it's dominant, I agree.
[01:40:33.521 --> 01:40:46.928]  Well, Madonna is a, I hesitate to use the word witch because of all of the inquisitorial connotations of that word, so I would call her a magician, and I would say that her recent 30 minute show in New York City
[01:40:47.389 --> 01:40:56.552]  Had all the hallmarks of a cabalistic open air ritual that was both broadcast on the internet and also much to do was made of it in New York City.
[01:40:56.572 --> 01:40:57.652]  Well she says it is!
[01:40:57.752 --> 01:40:59.033]  She says she's doing this!
[01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:01.694]  She's a chicken-necked coward is what she is.
[01:41:01.974 --> 01:41:03.834]  These people just radiate weakness, but go ahead.
[01:41:04.595 --> 01:41:11.157]  And she's also a kind of a mirror image of a biblical figure because she calls herself Madonna and I guess that's her birth name.
[01:41:11.197 --> 01:41:11.717]  Jezebel!
[01:41:13.467 --> 01:41:25.092]  Well, that's her actual identity would be Jezebel, but what we find is, for example, in Judaism they say, well, you Gentiles can be saved and you can be part of the covenant if you become a Noahide.
[01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:32.135]  But actually, they're not talking about the biblical Noah any more than Madonna is a representative of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.061]  She's the exact opposite.
[01:41:34.481 --> 01:41:39.384]  And the Talmudic Noah is the exact opposite of the Biblical Noah.
[01:41:39.404 --> 01:41:46.668]  So all these poor dupes and suckers who are joining Judaism... There's two ways to be a Gentile and join Judaism.
[01:41:46.968 --> 01:41:52.831]  One is through Holocaustianity and going down to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C.
[01:41:52.891 --> 01:41:58.414]  and believing everything that's there and believing that only one people on Earth suffered a Holocaust.
[01:41:58.474 --> 01:41:59.655]  That's one Enroden.
[01:42:00.316 --> 01:42:07.139]  And the other way is through the Noahide, but you're not following the biblical Noah, you're following the Noah of the Talmud.
[01:42:07.199 --> 01:42:14.782]  But also people that quote join it are only porch masons, or porch, that's what goes back to Solomon.
[01:42:14.822 --> 01:42:15.783]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:16.023 --> 01:42:20.685]  Actually, we're going to skip this break for InfoWars.com stream listeners.
[01:42:20.925 --> 01:42:25.667]  Go to that stream, you'll be able to hear this break, and then we'll come back for everybody else on the other side in three minutes.
[01:42:32.266 --> 01:42:46.004]  Yes, and so in the case of the Noahide and the Noah of the Talmud, the Talmud regards Noah as a drunk and a very unsavory character, and what you really have is you have a trap for Gentiles.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.682]  It's like the old story where Dracula couldn't enter your home unless you invited him in.
[01:42:52.742 --> 01:42:55.563]  He has to trick you to invite him in, but let me stop you there.
[01:42:56.083 --> 01:43:05.446]  Let's just, when we come back, start at the beginning so people understand this about how the Torah is different than the Talmud and the Zohar and all those.
[01:43:05.686 --> 01:43:10.608]  And how they're separate, because they're hearing this going, no, no, the Bible says no is good.
[01:43:10.648 --> 01:43:12.649]  They need to understand two separate deals.
[01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:21.554]  You've got a Middle Eastern group, you've got a European group that just picked up on things the Jews picked up in Babylon and of course in Egypt, and then try to explain that to people.
[01:43:22.254 --> 01:43:23.295]  Yeah, good point.
[01:43:23.375 --> 01:43:25.576]  But just go ahead for now, because we're going straight through.
[01:43:26.579 --> 01:43:29.400]  Okay, well, did you want me to continue with the Noah Hyde thing?
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:34.822]  Yeah, go ahead on that, and then let's come back to the full audience and get into the separation here.
[01:43:34.862 --> 01:43:35.082]  Go ahead.
[01:43:35.102 --> 01:43:37.503]  Alright, and you'll let me know when we're addressing the full audience.
[01:43:37.523 --> 01:43:38.823]  Yeah, we'll be addressing in two minutes.
[01:43:38.863 --> 01:43:39.203]  Go ahead.
[01:43:39.443 --> 01:43:39.783]  Okay.
[01:43:40.184 --> 01:43:49.807]  So, basically, the Talmud is bringing people, it's using people to think, these poor Christian people who think,
[01:43:50.997 --> 01:44:00.262]  Here's the Holy Blood of Israel flowing the veins of these rabbis, and I've got to get amalgamated with them, and the way to do that is to associate with this Noahide group.
[01:44:00.822 --> 01:44:05.904]  And then just like you asked Dracula, oh, won't you come into my home?
[01:44:05.984 --> 01:44:08.746]  And having done that, then he has a certain power over you.
[01:44:09.266 --> 01:44:15.349]  So you join the Noahide group, and whereas right now you and I are basically trying to expose
[01:44:16.134 --> 01:44:30.619]  Uh, these evils, but when you actually sign on for the evil, then of course you lose a certain amount of your volition and your cognition, and it's that much easier to snatch your soul and control you, and that's what the Noahide operation is.
[01:44:30.639 --> 01:44:34.200]  It has nothing to do with the scriptures whatsoever, but people don't understand
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:38.684]  Yeah, Rabbi Hagee and his Ku Klux Judaism are really, it's such a joke that you would
[01:44:53.740 --> 01:44:55.921]  You would laugh if you didn't feel like crying.
[01:44:55.981 --> 01:44:56.801]  I mean, you don't really know what to do.
[01:44:56.821 --> 01:45:04.844]  Well, I mean, I've seen him on tape go, I praise God every time a Palestinian child is shot because another devil has been dealt with.
[01:45:04.864 --> 01:45:07.085]  I mean, he is just such a little fake.
[01:45:07.425 --> 01:45:10.126]  And Jesus did not come to be the Messiah.
[01:45:10.326 --> 01:45:14.187]  He was a rebel against the Lord's people and was dealt with.
[01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:15.227]  But you know what?
[01:45:15.267 --> 01:45:16.748]  He was forced to pull that book.
[01:45:18.444 --> 01:45:25.547]  Yeah, but can you imagine that John McCain maintains respectability even though he's allied with him with certain qualifications?
[01:45:25.567 --> 01:45:26.267]  I know, it's incredible.
[01:45:26.287 --> 01:45:27.227]  We're going back live right now.
[01:45:27.247 --> 01:45:27.587]  Here we go.
[01:45:31.829 --> 01:45:36.771]  Okay, um... Be clear, though, about the separate groups.
[01:45:36.791 --> 01:45:43.513]  Like, you have the Torah, which is the Old Testament, which is literally 180 degrees from what comes later.
[01:45:43.573 --> 01:45:45.354]  I mean, let's start at the beginning here.
[01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:51.785]  Y'all, well, you know, we're dealing with master deceivers, and so there's a counterfeit.
[01:45:51.885 --> 01:46:01.993]  We were talking about that while at the commercial break, how it's a mirror world, a mirror of the scripture, and a mirror of biblical patriarchs and biblical figures.
[01:46:02.434 --> 01:46:06.397]  And so we will hear Orthodox rabbis say, well, we're Torah true.
[01:46:06.437 --> 01:46:07.858]  We have to follow the Torah.
[01:46:07.898 --> 01:46:08.919]  We have the Torah.
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:17.343]  And in fact, the rabbis tell those who are part of Judaism, you can't understand the Bible without the mediation of our interpretation of it.
[01:46:18.303 --> 01:46:21.024]  Protestants don't seem to have a problem with that.
[01:46:21.064 --> 01:46:33.828]  They have a huge problem with the idea that the Pope claims to be a mediator of Scripture, but when the rabbis make that claim, they seem to be very apathetic about that.
[01:46:33.868 --> 01:46:36.169]  I don't understand that, but anyhow,
[01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:39.070]  Let's be clear about the Torah.
[01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:43.592]  When they say that they're Torah-true, they mean that they're Talmud-true.
[01:46:43.972 --> 01:46:53.517]  Because there is the Torah Shibik-Tav, which is the written Torah, and the Torah Shibel-Pah, which is the oral Torah.
[01:46:54.217 --> 01:46:58.179]  And they say that is the real law, not the old law.
[01:46:59.008 --> 01:47:04.691]  Well, yeah, what they say is there is a dual law, that Moses was given two laws on Mount Sinai.
[01:47:04.731 --> 01:47:13.957]  The oral law, which became the province of the rabbis, and which was only written down after Israel crucified its Messiah, and then really became degenerate.
[01:47:13.997 --> 01:47:22.062]  Prior to that, it had been a toss-up which way they were going to go, and so they had never sufficiently lost the grace to commit this evil to writing.
[01:47:22.282 --> 01:47:27.405]  And Moses, when he actually went after him, throwing the tablets, he was going after this group, is what a lot of people say.
[01:47:28.632 --> 01:47:33.454]  Well, I certainly think that it must have started around the time of the Golden Calf.
[01:47:33.474 --> 01:47:38.255]  Well, they were bringing back the Egyptian secret knowledge they'd found, and he was saying, no, no.
[01:47:38.475 --> 01:47:41.456]  So it's that same group always running right next to the other.
[01:47:41.957 --> 01:47:42.217]  Yes.
[01:47:42.417 --> 01:47:50.940]  As we mentioned in the last broadcast, the Talmud says ten measures of sorcery were given to the earth, nine were given to Egypt, and one to the rest of humanity.
[01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:54.921]  So they certainly see Egypt as a source of magic and sorcery.
[01:47:54.941 --> 01:47:57.562]  Of course, officially they condemn Egypt, but actually
[01:47:58.064 --> 01:48:03.668]  Secretly, they have tapped into that power, and they actually pay obeisance to it.
[01:48:03.748 --> 01:48:13.536]  And as you said last time you were on, or as the late Arthur C. Clarke said, a Texas Instruments calculator would be the highest order of magic to somebody just 200 years ago.
[01:48:13.856 --> 01:48:22.463]  So when we use the term magic sorcery, that's ways to manipulate populations, lie, spin things, and then they just package it in a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
[01:48:22.483 --> 01:48:22.763]  Go ahead.
[01:48:23.311 --> 01:48:38.137]  Yeah, because leftist intellectuals could accuse us of mystifying the discussion by bringing in magic, but actually they're the ones who are mystifying when they refuse, when they use this agnosticism to refuse to recognize how technology operates.
[01:48:38.637 --> 01:48:49.122]  And in the last program I mentioned that Arthur C. Clarke, his famous statement was that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
[01:48:49.202 --> 01:48:50.382]  So that's what we're talking about.
[01:48:50.402 --> 01:48:51.743]  We're talking about a science
[01:48:52.412 --> 01:49:00.616]  Which even certain scientists have been able to cover up and mock and direct our attention away from by claiming, oh, that's just silly fairy tales.
[01:49:00.736 --> 01:49:01.277]  But it isn't.
[01:49:01.357 --> 01:49:11.002]  And Arthur C. Clarke, who was a pioneer and prophet of the satellites that we now have operating around our Earth, and a key agent of the cryptocracy... He's the inventor of it, Glenn.
[01:49:12.519 --> 01:49:13.820]  So he's our source for that.
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:16.182]  So you see Alex, we have this counterfeit.
[01:49:16.242 --> 01:49:21.787]  We have the Noahide Covenant, but actually it has nothing to do with the biblical Noah.
[01:49:21.887 --> 01:49:26.211]  It's the Noah of the Talmud and of the post-Talmudic text.
[01:49:26.611 --> 01:49:31.255]  Which is what the Torah tells us is that this group will always have counterfeits.
[01:49:31.295 --> 01:49:32.937]  They're masters at doing that.
[01:49:33.755 --> 01:49:43.522]  Sure, Revelation 2.9 talks about, I know them who say they are Jews and are not, and are of the synagogue of Satan, so right there we're being warned of a counterfeit.
[01:49:44.122 --> 01:50:01.995]  Jesus, in the key book of John, in chapter 8, talking about the counterfeit, and that's a key theme there in chapter 8, because it pertains directly to what we're dealing with now, where they say, we have Abraham's blood in our veins, we are the children of Abraham, and Jesus acknowledges their biological
[01:50:02.475 --> 01:50:03.035]  Pedigree.
[01:50:03.295 --> 01:50:07.076]  But at the same time, he says you can't have Abraham as your father.
[01:50:07.096 --> 01:50:07.536]  Stay there!
[01:50:09.797 --> 01:50:10.877]  You are listening to GPM.
[01:50:10.917 --> 01:50:12.017]  Bring it up for me, please.
[01:50:13.858 --> 01:50:18.999]  Mr. Hoffman, we're gonna be back in one minute, so I'm gonna go ahead and spare discussion now for this one minute, okay?
[01:50:19.639 --> 01:50:19.919]  Sure.
[01:50:20.019 --> 01:50:22.240]  We're gonna go, we'll be back in about 60 seconds.
[01:50:25.244 --> 01:50:29.107]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:50:29.427 --> 01:50:34.890]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:39.113]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:50:39.413 --> 01:50:44.336]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:50:44.596 --> 01:50:47.377]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:51:20.954 --> 01:51:22.896]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:51:23.336 --> 01:51:26.099]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:51.687 --> 01:51:58.110]  You want hardcore news, cutting-edge information, truly sophisticated discussions and debates?
[01:51:58.150 --> 01:51:58.811]  You get it here.
[01:52:00.011 --> 01:52:03.133]  In this fourth hour, we're going to go 20 minutes more with our guest.
[01:52:03.233 --> 01:52:04.294]  In overdrive, he can do it.
[01:52:04.554 --> 01:52:13.278]  We're going to skip some of the network breaks so I can talk behind the scenes for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and people listening to the streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:13.298 --> 01:52:16.360]  You've got to go to those audio streams, though, to be able to tune into it.
[01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:18.201]  Or you can miss out on it if you'd like.
[01:52:19.041 --> 01:52:19.902]  Mr. Hoffman, go ahead.
[01:52:21.124 --> 01:52:30.072]  Well, one of the things that I think is important to understand, Alex, is that we need counterintelligence and we need to recruit among the Judaics themselves.
[01:52:30.773 --> 01:52:43.104]  And that's one of the reasons why I've been able to profit in my research has been that I have had Judaic informants inside the yeshivas and the kolels who assist me with my research.
[01:52:43.204 --> 01:52:44.505]  And I want to encourage that.
[01:52:44.605 --> 01:52:47.528]  I wouldn't be able to benefit from the details they've given me.
[01:52:48.047 --> 01:52:58.549]  If they thought that I was a racist hater, and it feeds into the Rabbi's image of the Gentile and of the Christian, if we in any way reinforce that image.
[01:52:58.589 --> 01:53:06.030]  Now, what I wanted to do was, I wanted to give you the actual teaching that Talmudic children receive in Orthodox Judaism.
[01:53:06.730 --> 01:53:10.751]  This is a phrase that's repeated to them throughout their childhood, and I'll give it to you now.
[01:53:15.825 --> 01:53:18.427]  And translated that means, it is a given law.
[01:53:18.687 --> 01:53:21.709]  It is known that Esau hates Jacob.
[01:53:22.049 --> 01:53:25.291]  Now they see themselves as Esau, and we are Jacob.
[01:53:25.811 --> 01:53:36.277]  And what they're being told from the time they're little children is, is that they are irrationally hated just because they are Judaic.
[01:53:36.777 --> 01:53:42.881]  Not because they mistreat the Palestinians, not because they have inordinate influence over Congress.
[01:53:43.348 --> 01:54:01.154]  Now, if we, in our information campaign, fulfill that stereotype as so many people in the right-wing and the neo-Nazi movement, and even in the Arab world, have done and are doing, and are encouraged to do by Ajahn Provocateurs, we are then doing the work of the rabbis.
[01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:05.355]  Because we need to convert rabbis, and we need to convert Judaics.
[01:54:05.755 --> 01:54:09.518]  Judaics who are listening to me right now, Jesus loves you.
[01:54:09.538 --> 01:54:17.003]  He wants to free you from these burdens, this terrible yoke that the Talmudists have put upon you.
[01:54:17.384 --> 01:54:22.527]  Well it's the same thing like our government, and that's the same mindset, you see the same paradigm, the same signature.
[01:54:23.148 --> 01:54:26.690]  The government's going to keep you safe from the terrorists, really the government's behind it.
[01:54:26.970 --> 01:54:28.972]  The government's going to take your rights to keep you safe.
[01:54:29.412 --> 01:54:30.814]  No, they're not keeping us safe.
[01:54:30.854 --> 01:54:32.335]  They're hurting us and sucking off of us.
[01:54:32.675 --> 01:54:37.360]  It's the same group with the leadership using their mind control system on their own people.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:41.704]  I mean, you already said that twice, but I want to make that clear.
[01:54:42.244 --> 01:54:42.624]  Go ahead.
[01:54:43.125 --> 01:54:49.471]  Well, because what they're saying is there is a racial war to the hilt, and it's irremediable.
[01:54:49.611 --> 01:54:55.196]  There's nothing that they can do to change their race, and therefore, since they describe all of us,
[01:54:55.760 --> 01:55:02.727]  Or the majority of us as being racial haters of them, you then have this chasm that can't be bridged.
[01:55:03.208 --> 01:55:09.875]  And so if we actually take that position as so many in the past have, then we're shooting ourselves in the feet.
[01:55:09.935 --> 01:55:16.922]  So it's very, very important to understand that we're dealing here with an ideology, with a spiritual force.
[01:55:17.515 --> 01:55:29.630]  And for example, this spiritual force, as you know on your program and have brought up many times, operates within Freemasonry, and they're the most blue-eyed, blonde-haired, Aryan Gentiles they can be.
[01:55:29.971 --> 01:55:33.255]  We have evil in every race and every nation.
[01:55:33.735 --> 01:55:44.683]  But because of the nature of the Talmud and the Kabbalah, that evil is centered on this notion of the racial supremacy of the Judaic as personified by the Rabbi.
[01:55:46.424 --> 01:55:53.509]  Which is in the Talmud, which is in the Zohar, which is in all the books, and then it's in Encyclopedia Judaica, but we're not supposed to talk about that.
[01:55:54.062 --> 01:56:00.431]  And we're actually dealing with the source of racism in the world as a whole, because it's not in the Bible.
[01:56:01.092 --> 01:56:03.095]  And it certainly is not in Islam.
[01:56:03.195 --> 01:56:10.986]  Islam may have many problems and many errors, and there's no question about that, but Islam does not practice racism.
[01:56:12.027 --> 01:56:23.195]  The most searing and ferocious and savage racism on the earth today is the racism of the Talmud, and then it's practiced and implemented in the Zionist Israeli state.
[01:56:23.436 --> 01:56:24.156]  Okay, stay there.
[01:56:24.456 --> 01:56:24.797]  Stay there.
[01:56:24.817 --> 01:56:26.018]  We're going to continue during the break.
[01:56:26.038 --> 01:56:28.179]  If you're an InfoWars listener, stay with us, and I will be right back.
[01:56:30.675 --> 01:56:32.818]  Okay, now I want to debate with you a little bit here.
[01:56:32.878 --> 01:56:47.297]  There's no doubt it says all that and does that and it's wrong, but then I look at every culture, or even one African tribe across the river from the other, they'll say the other tribe is bad, we're the best, you know, they worship the snake god, we worship the monkey god, we're better, or we worship the water buffalo god.
[01:56:47.757 --> 01:56:54.044]  You've got, you know, groups are always, I mean, everybody says our team's the best, or, you know, folks from East Texas are better than North Texans.
[01:56:54.724 --> 01:56:56.166]  I mean, we're all tribal.
[01:56:56.486 --> 01:56:59.489]  I mean, everybody says the other group isn't human and deserves to die.
[01:56:59.969 --> 01:57:04.394]  I mean, that's what the Aztecs would say when they were wiping out, you know, neighboring native tribes with sacrifice.
[01:57:04.914 --> 01:57:11.221]  I mean, you're not making the claim, though, as some do, that all evil and all racism emanates out of one place, are you?
[01:57:12.479 --> 01:57:17.484]  Well, what I would say is that this tribalism that you're talking about is part of human nature.
[01:57:17.544 --> 01:57:20.407]  Now, I'm a Christian, so I'm supposed to be unnatural.
[01:57:20.527 --> 01:57:37.823]  I mean, that's what a Christian is in the sense that, for example... But you're saying out of the three major faiths that spring out of Abraham, you're saying the one that has the new text, the Zohar and the rest of it, the Talmud, that has codified these ideas, you're saying it comes from the Judaics.
[01:57:38.456 --> 01:57:41.618]  Well, of course, I don't believe that Judaism springs from Abraham.
[01:57:41.638 --> 01:57:43.579]  I don't see it as an Abraham.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:45.901]  Okay, well what was Moses then?
[01:57:46.621 --> 01:57:48.102]  You wouldn't call that Judaism?
[01:57:48.543 --> 01:57:50.104]  No, that's not Judaism.
[01:57:50.124 --> 01:57:53.466]  Judaism didn't get started until this oral law was written down.
[01:57:53.606 --> 01:57:54.126]  I understand.
[01:57:54.166 --> 01:57:55.447]  So what would you call him?
[01:57:55.487 --> 01:57:56.267]  An Israelite?
[01:57:56.528 --> 01:57:57.828]  I would call him an Israelite.
[01:57:57.869 --> 01:58:01.091]  I would say the only Old Testament religion on earth is Christianity.
[01:58:03.472 --> 01:58:04.313]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:58:04.493 --> 01:58:05.313]  It's definitely the root.
[01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:12.873]  If we see that they have a patrimony to Abraham, then we're beginning to see through their distorted lens.
[01:58:13.333 --> 01:58:16.935]  Well, yeah, like you said earlier, that thing they said is that Abraham's bad.
[01:58:17.835 --> 01:58:20.336]  That's insane, because... Noah's bad.
[01:58:20.716 --> 01:58:26.379]  Yeah, but before that, you were saying what they say as kids about how they're the one group and they're against Abraham.
[01:58:26.879 --> 01:58:30.181]  Well, no, they say that they are Jacob.
[01:58:30.942 --> 01:58:36.949]  And I may have misstated... I think that's what you did, yeah, because I always thought it was Jacob and the Arabs of the other group.
[01:58:37.229 --> 01:58:38.790]  Okay, yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:58:38.810 --> 01:58:42.875]  They believe that they're Jacob and we're Esau, so I actually apologize for that.
[01:58:42.895 --> 01:58:43.696]  I got that mixed up.
[01:58:43.736 --> 01:58:51.404]  They see themselves as Jacob, we are Esau, and so we're doing this... And then that's what got picked up with the transatlantic slave trade.
[01:58:52.438 --> 01:58:58.819]  Well, that's part of coming from the Midrash and from the Guide of the Perplexed of Rabbi Moses Mammamides.
[01:58:58.899 --> 01:59:07.581]  The anti-black teaching is in those two documents, although you've got to get the uncensored version of the Guide of the Perplexed, as translated by Shlomo Pines.
[01:59:07.781 --> 01:59:12.002]  If you get any other version, usually the racial material has been excised.
[01:59:12.862 --> 01:59:13.622]  Yeah, okay.
[01:59:13.662 --> 01:59:16.943]  We're going to come back right now.
[01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:17.543]  We're going live.
[01:59:17.563 --> 01:59:17.903]  Stay with us.
[01:59:20.311 --> 01:59:23.772]  Visit them online today at Braintuner.com.
[01:59:23.852 --> 01:59:27.173]  That's Braintuner, T-U-N-E-R dot com.
[01:59:32.835 --> 01:59:33.495]  Big Brother.
[01:59:34.135 --> 01:59:35.196]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:35.916 --> 01:59:37.036]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:37.676 --> 01:59:38.497]  You want answers?
[01:59:39.237 --> 01:59:40.117]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:40.817 --> 01:59:44.458]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:44.999 --> 01:59:49.100]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:50.439 --> 01:59:53.120]  Our guest for the rest of this hour, into the next.
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:54.361]  We're going into overdrive today.
[01:59:54.381 --> 01:59:56.622]  This is Michael Hoffman.
[01:59:56.642 --> 02:00:00.424]  We'll give out his website, some of his books, tell you how to get them before he leaves us.
[02:00:00.544 --> 02:00:01.665]  He can do it any time he wishes.
[02:00:04.207 --> 02:00:05.749]  If he wants, we'll take calls later.
[02:00:05.769 --> 02:00:06.890]  We'll see if he wants to do that.
[02:00:08.511 --> 02:00:13.376]  Continuing, we were having a discussion on the InfoWars stream for Prison Planet TV viewers.
[02:00:14.297 --> 02:00:19.942]  I asked you, I said, don't you mean Jacob against Esau?
[02:00:19.962 --> 02:00:23.405]  You said yes, you'd gotten that backwards earlier, probably with all my interrupting.
[02:00:25.687 --> 02:00:28.190]  Just continue wherever you'd like.
[02:00:28.959 --> 02:00:42.678]  Yeah, the website is www.revisionisthistory.org, and yes, when I was translating Halakha Hibiyot, Ishi Esav, Sona Eliakov, I actually transposed it incorrectly.
[02:00:43.765 --> 02:01:06.096]  The Judaics regard themselves, of course, as Jacob, and we are Esau, and they see this as a racial divide that can never be breached, and that's why they have this sense of immunity and entitlement that they're never wrong, they never have to apologize, they never commit war crimes, and any accusations along those lines are being fielded by latter-day Esaus against themselves as Jacob.
[02:01:06.176 --> 02:01:10.198]  So that's kind of a codifying, a psychopathic outlook.
[02:01:11.678 --> 02:01:12.018]  It is.
[02:01:12.178 --> 02:01:28.108]  It's a religion which has the symptoms of psychopathology because they have delusions of grandeur as being the superior master race on Earth, and they're also paranoid in that they have this incipient fear of opposition.
[02:01:28.698 --> 02:01:32.141]  And those are two symptoms, of course, of insanity.
[02:01:32.321 --> 02:01:40.207]  But it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, because it's an intelligent, you know, group that is getting a lot of power, and so there's going to be competition, eh?
[02:01:40.567 --> 02:01:42.228]  And there is also going to be people fighting.
[02:01:43.649 --> 02:01:45.591]  Well, it's constant warfare Zionism.
[02:01:45.671 --> 02:01:48.233]  I usually append the word Zionism with war.
[02:01:48.393 --> 02:01:50.975]  It's war Zionism, and it's war to the hilt.
[02:01:51.630 --> 02:02:07.704]  And of course you see that on the West Bank with these settlers and their Talmudic philosophy of annihilating Amalek, which is what they refer to the Palestinians as Amalek, and of course in the Old Testament Amalek was a people who were supposed to be exterminated, so they're actually calling
[02:02:08.351 --> 02:02:20.696]  for the extermination of the Palestinians but once again that's not Alex on an Old Testament basis because as you know in the Old Testament God says he did do away with Amalek and he said I will blot out its memory forever.
[02:02:20.756 --> 02:02:22.656]  And he said also kill their animals.
[02:02:23.497 --> 02:02:23.757]  Yeah.
[02:02:23.877 --> 02:02:37.342]  But see how do you deal with that as a Christian because you've got the Old Testament which Christians accept and saying yeah go ahead and kill everybody when you take over this land kill them and their animals but then modern oh it's Talmudic it's evil it's bad when they want to wipe everybody out.
[02:02:37.847 --> 02:02:39.048]  Yeah, well that's a good question.
[02:02:39.748 --> 02:02:51.093]  I do just want to say, however, that the modern use of Amalek shows the Talmudic nullification of Scripture, because God keeps His promises, and He said, I would blot out the memory of Amalek.
[02:02:51.573 --> 02:03:00.418]  True Christians today don't go around calling anybody Amalek, but the Talmudists do, and so they're actually contradicting the Old Testament.
[02:03:00.518 --> 02:03:03.059]  Also, God ended Amalek with an announcement.
[02:03:04.177 --> 02:03:14.720]  Well, he ended it through his own power, and you challenge me with the idea of God taking out these nations in the Old Testament.
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:28.884]  Invariably, when a nation was destroyed in the Old Testament, it was a nation that was practicing sexual sin under occult auspices, and that will destroy us, it will destroy... Yeah, Moloch, Moloch, Moloch, burning babies to him.
[02:03:29.670 --> 02:03:29.890]  Yeah.
[02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:31.450]  So that's what we're talking about.
[02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:37.952]  We're not talking about any innocent nation of people that God simply picked on because his chosen people were coming along.
[02:03:38.412 --> 02:03:43.653]  Because if you really read the Old Testament, it's an indictment against the Israelites.
[02:03:44.473 --> 02:03:55.016]  And the great prophets who Jesus said from Abel to Zechariah were killed, they were killed for criticizing Israel and telling them that they were falling short.
[02:03:55.076 --> 02:03:59.317]  Just like today, if we try to say the same things, we become under attack.
[02:03:59.933 --> 02:04:05.937]  And another indicator, Alex, that the religion of Judaism is not an Old Testament religion.
[02:04:06.237 --> 02:04:09.018]  We were talking earlier about how they disparage Noah.
[02:04:09.419 --> 02:04:12.100]  They also disparage the prophet Isaiah.
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:14.842]  Now, how can you do that and be an Old Testament religion?
[02:04:14.882 --> 02:04:19.504]  This comes out in my book that I'll be finishing up soon called Judaism Discovered.
[02:04:19.945 --> 02:04:24.207]  The prophet Isaiah, as you know, criticized Israel.
[02:04:24.727 --> 02:04:28.970]  And so the Talmud says of Isaiah that he had unclean lips.
[02:04:29.511 --> 02:04:33.074]  And they say that Isaiah was killed and he got what he deserved.
[02:04:33.114 --> 02:04:44.145]  In fact, the Talmudic description of his death is that he was sawed with a saw that went right across his mouth to punish him for saying these terrible things about the Jews.
[02:04:44.765 --> 02:04:51.932]  Now, no biblical religion would ever side with the killers of Isaiah, but that's what Jesus identified them as.
[02:04:52.032 --> 02:04:54.274]  He said, you've been the killers of the prophets.
[02:04:54.998 --> 02:05:00.621]  And you've been the killers of the prophets historically, this ideology and this spirit that you embody.
[02:05:00.962 --> 02:05:17.491]  And that's what we're confronting in the Israeli state, and we're confronting among Orthodox Judaism today in the United States, where George Bush on April 15th, as all of his predecessors since Jimmy Carter did on Education Day USA, met with the Chabad Lubavitchers in the White House.
[02:05:17.871 --> 02:05:19.692]  He got his marching orders from them.
[02:05:20.093 --> 02:05:24.015]  He dedicated this nation to the phony Talmudic Noahide laws.
[02:05:24.657 --> 02:05:45.516]  Under the rulership of their dead messiah, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, that's been going on since Jimmy Carter, the conservative Ronald Reagan, both Bushes... Let me ask you, what do you think Carter's doing now, going over and saying it's apartheid and genocide and wrong and being barred from entry to Israel and things like that?
[02:05:46.141 --> 02:05:58.830]  Well, I'd have to preface my remarks on Jimmy Carter by saying that I was very, very angry at that man at one time, particularly when he instituted the cooperation with Castro for the disastrous Marielle Boatlift.
[02:05:59.410 --> 02:06:06.515]  I don't know if he has ever really done penance for that because he unleashed from Castro's insane asylums and prisons
[02:06:07.088 --> 02:06:14.494]  The dregs of that island nation, they came over here, they raped, they murdered, and they plundered, and that is on Jimmy Carter's record.
[02:06:14.554 --> 02:06:30.787]  Now, all I can do is surmise, Alex, that he has had a change of heart, that he's one of the very rare people who has been at the top that knows he was implicated in sin and wrong and evil, and in his own way, he's trying to make up for that, and I think he's doing that.
[02:06:31.549 --> 02:06:34.252]  In his trips to the Middle East, I think he's doing good work.
[02:06:34.292 --> 02:06:38.317]  His book on the apartheid system over there is wonderful.
[02:06:38.417 --> 02:06:39.618]  I don't agree with all of it.
[02:06:40.039 --> 02:06:49.129]  But this is a man who is trying to fashion in his own sort of stumbling way a type of Christian witness in his old age.
[02:06:49.169 --> 02:06:50.591]  And I'll tell you, I'll take that.
[02:06:51.131 --> 02:07:02.354]  Well, that's why the globalists a lot of times kill older globalists, because they do.
[02:07:02.474 --> 02:07:06.495]  Some people turn back, you know, kind of on the cross there at the last minute next to Christ.
[02:07:07.035 --> 02:07:14.977]  But expanding on that, and I do think he's doing it for good reasons, just from, you know, what I pick up, you know, his body language, listening to it, analyzing it.
[02:07:15.757 --> 02:07:18.137]  And it's not a hateful thing he's doing, he's doing it in a peaceable way.
[02:07:20.618 --> 02:07:28.340]  Again, everything you describe about Judaism, again, I see those similar excuses, those similar claims manifested in other cultures.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:30.221]  And this is obviously a dominant culture.
[02:07:30.741 --> 02:07:36.583]  I'm just wanting to add that, again, humans rationalize, come up with this same stuff across the board.
[02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:40.350]  Oh yeah, but see, we're all free to challenge all those people.
[02:07:40.710 --> 02:07:46.212]  We're free to challenge Reverend Wright when he makes these statements.
[02:07:46.532 --> 02:08:00.957]  We're free to challenge the Chinese on Tibet, but as soon as we apply the same criterion to the Israelis and want to treat them equally as all other human beings who have both shortcomings and a good side and a bad side,
[02:08:01.417 --> 02:08:08.079]  Suddenly, we become Esau, they're Jacob, and it's Halakha, Hebe, Yodesh, Yeisav, Sanai, Lel, Yaakov.
[02:08:08.239 --> 02:08:15.342]  And that's a special situation that we're dealing with whenever we enter into the territory of these rabbis.
[02:08:15.362 --> 02:08:20.404]  Well, I think the source... Now, are you saying in all rabbinical sects you basically get the same thing?
[02:08:21.044 --> 02:08:29.687]  Because I know in certain neighborhoods in New York or in the Middle East, the new film about Bin Laden,
[02:08:30.447 --> 02:08:31.208]  By Spurlock.
[02:08:31.648 --> 02:08:34.751]  He's just in Israel and these rabbis start beating him up, calling him filth.
[02:08:35.051 --> 02:08:36.332]  You know, he's not allowed in the neighborhood.
[02:08:36.532 --> 02:08:39.795]  But then other rabbis run up and get him and say, no, no, that's a crazy group of people.
[02:08:40.495 --> 02:08:47.341]  I mean, you know, like you have the one group of rabbis saying Israel shouldn't exist, which has got hundreds of thousands of people, Nutter Cardi and a few other groups.
[02:08:47.802 --> 02:08:53.226]  And then you've got other, I mean, there's also, from what I've seen, a few different brands of Zionism.
[02:08:53.266 --> 02:08:56.209]  I mean, you have the big dominant one, but then there's also some other ones.
[02:08:56.609 --> 02:08:57.410]  What's your take on that?
[02:08:58.163 --> 02:08:59.503]  Yeah, well, that's a good question.
[02:08:59.543 --> 02:09:14.908]  I'm talking mainly about Orthodox Judaism, because that, of course, was all the Judaism that existed on Earth until the Mescala, that's to say, the Enlightenment, which coincides with the liberal Enlightenment in Europe at its height in the late 18th century.
[02:09:15.788 --> 02:09:27.712]  And prior to that, from the founding of Judaism, after the traditions of men, the oral traditions of men, were committed to writing in the Mishnah, and then later in the Gemara, in the first, second, third
[02:09:28.277 --> 02:09:37.921]  Four centuries A.D., all you had was Orthodox Judaism, and then two branches, actually three, Reconstructionism, which is extremely liberal and almost not a factor here.
[02:09:38.381 --> 02:09:49.366]  But two main branches broke off, and that's the Reform branch, based on the Mascala, or the Enlightenment, and the Conservative branch, which tried to take a middle road between the two.
[02:09:49.766 --> 02:09:54.108]  And what that really means is, Alex, the majority of Judaics in America who are religious,
[02:09:54.768 --> 02:10:00.230]  And who are following Judaism, are Reform Judaics, and a lot of them have never seen the Talmud in their life.
[02:10:14.614 --> 02:10:22.961]  Larger picture, I mean, in your massive study of this, you're probably one of the former scholars who honestly looks at it, not from a bigoted view, but from a, you know, just a cold scientific perspective.
[02:10:23.222 --> 02:10:25.524]  What's the power structure, you know, and the pyramidal structure?
[02:10:25.904 --> 02:10:29.667]  I mean, what percentage of the elite of the Judaics really know what's going on?
[02:10:29.987 --> 02:10:31.429]  And then, you know, what are the substratus?
[02:10:31.449 --> 02:10:32.690]  What's the command structure?
[02:10:33.220 --> 02:10:39.844]  Well, see, one of the doors into Judaism for Gentiles I mentioned was the Noahide Laws and Holocaustianity.
[02:10:39.864 --> 02:10:46.388]  I was about to say, the fake Christian Zionists now seem to be one of the most dominant, virulent, vicious groups now.
[02:10:46.968 --> 02:10:56.234]  Yeah, much to the scandalization of the Gospel, because a whole generation of young people are now turned off to the Bible and Jesus Christ because they associate it with these bloodthirsty warmongers.
[02:10:56.707 --> 02:11:07.709]  But to get back to your question, the access route for these reformed Judaics who are sort of just cultural Judaics and they... Tell you what, stay there!
[02:11:07.729 --> 02:11:08.209]  We got a break.
[02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:09.530]  We'll talk during the break about this.
[02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:11.550]  For the network, we'll be back in four minutes.
[02:11:12.510 --> 02:11:13.650]  Michael Hoffman is our guest.
[02:11:13.771 --> 02:11:17.011]  I think all the listeners, all the affiliates, all of the sponsors, everybody.
[02:11:17.891 --> 02:11:19.932]  We'll be right back in four minutes for everybody else.
[02:11:20.132 --> 02:11:25.573]  For InfoWars.com streamed listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv members, you can continue to watch right now.
[02:11:29.068 --> 02:11:31.428]  Okay, Mr. Hoffman, please continue with the power structure.
[02:11:32.369 --> 02:11:42.811]  Yeah, so the door, Alex, for these sort of agnostic, liberal, Judaic types that you say that you're familiar with, the door into the Talmud for them is through Zionism.
[02:11:43.211 --> 02:11:50.932]  Because Zionism is actually the Talmud in action, even though the Israeli state was founded by Communists and Secularists.
[02:11:50.952 --> 02:11:56.113]  So it's the modern political manifestation and the door for the Secularists to enter back in.
[02:11:57.031 --> 02:12:07.966]  Well, you have to use Moses Hess, and this will be in my book, and for those who subscribe to my newsletter, Revisionist History, they're already familiar with him because
[02:12:08.450 --> 02:12:13.855]  He is the person who took inside himself both the Talmud, Zionism, and Communism.
[02:12:13.935 --> 02:12:16.297]  Karl Marx called him my Communist Rabbi.
[02:12:16.677 --> 02:12:23.563]  He was also the spiritual founder of Zionism before Herzl, and he was actually loyal to the Talmud.
[02:12:23.603 --> 02:12:28.367]  He's an incredible personality, very important for people to study, to understand.
[02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:35.653]  He lived in the 1800s to understand how the 20th century came about and these evils were imposed on us.
[02:12:36.738 --> 02:12:48.141]  Because a listener can say, oh my gosh, Hoffman's trying to say that the road to the Talmud is through Zionism, but so many Israelis are secularists, they don't want to have anything to do with the Talmud.
[02:12:48.561 --> 02:12:50.381]  That's correct, to a degree.
[02:12:50.481 --> 02:13:02.064]  It's a generalization, and there's some distortion there, because the Talmud, as we've been talking about from the outset, is inherently, ipso facto, prima facie racist.
[02:13:02.784 --> 02:13:04.945]  And what does it share with Zionism?
[02:13:05.413 --> 02:13:08.536]  Prima facie, ipso facto, racist.
[02:13:08.556 --> 02:13:34.477]  See, I want to be clear, that's why this system is so perfectly designed to take over other political systems, because it takes from Egypt, it takes from Rome, it takes from Babylon, it takes from the Old Temple, it takes all of those intrigues, and then it takes the crusade clashes, and all of this, and then how to control your subgroup that thinks you're taking care of them, how to stage events, how to do all of this,
[02:13:36.078 --> 02:13:41.661]  It's a tiny ruling cabal that does study human behavior and activity, ruling over these people.
[02:13:41.701 --> 02:13:46.904]  Now, would you say that the political Zionists are in control now, or are some of these rabbis still in control?
[02:13:46.984 --> 02:13:48.785]  And if so, which group of rabbis?
[02:13:49.886 --> 02:14:04.115]  Well, I would say the main political rabbinic power is associated with the Chabad Lubavitch, because they are the ones who have been more or less delegated to go out into the world, to not be so much the literary recluses and bookworms
[02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:16.459]  To go out there and do missionary evangelism with the Judaics who have lapsed in their religion, and also to act as the political point men with the various leaders of the United States Congress.
[02:14:16.479 --> 02:14:18.241]  Oh, you ought to hear them on the Christian radio shows.
[02:14:18.281 --> 02:14:19.822]  This is the craziest stuff I've ever heard.
[02:14:21.092 --> 02:14:27.999]  Well, and I'd be happy to debate an Orthodox rabbi, if you can arrange it, or one of these other Christian programs do.
[02:14:28.059 --> 02:14:28.980]  I'd be delighted to do that.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.383]  I'd be also delighted to take telephone calls today.
[02:14:31.843 --> 02:14:41.313]  But the Chabad Lubavitchers are probably the most politically endowed, both in the former Soviet Union, the Russian Federation, in the United States, and in Europe.
[02:14:41.873 --> 02:14:54.380]  Very powerful there, and when we're talking, all these neocons are talking about Islamic fundamentalism and the war on reason, and yet the Chabad Lubavitch and other allied rabbinic groups have tremendous political power.
[02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:58.642]  They're fanatic, they're fundamentalists, they're against the Enlightenment, they're against freedom.
[02:14:59.304 --> 02:15:15.047]  They're weaseling their way into Europe and the United States government, and yet, whenever these guys with these myriad, dozens and dozens of books about how the Islamists are making war on our way of life and they're going to abridge our freedom of speech, I've had my freedom of speech and my freedom of press
[02:15:17.428 --> 02:15:18.509]  Well, I mean, that's a joke.
[02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:21.931]  Al-Qaeda attacked us because they hate our freedom, and the government's taking all our freedoms.
[02:15:21.971 --> 02:15:22.872]  That's right, they're Al-Qaeda.
[02:15:22.892 --> 02:15:30.477]  We're going to go back live right now, sir, and I do want to get some into, you know, the Twilight communication, all their, you know, the forms of brainwashing.
[02:15:30.857 --> 02:15:31.798]  I'd like to get into that soon.
[02:15:31.818 --> 02:15:32.118]  Here we go.
[02:15:41.989 --> 02:16:00.005]  Right there's Jack outside La Grange And you know what I'm talking about Just let me know if you want to go To that home out on the range They got a lot of nice girls, huh?
[02:16:00.145 --> 02:16:01.126]  La Grange!
[02:16:01.206 --> 02:16:02.007]  The Ranch!
[02:16:02.027 --> 02:16:03.128]  Right outside Austin!
[02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:04.569]  Ha ha!
[02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:06.691]  Ha ha!
[02:16:09.577 --> 02:16:10.518]  Hard to turn this off.
[02:16:10.559 --> 02:16:11.019]  Good stuff.
[02:16:28.924 --> 02:16:32.467]  Our guest with us about 20 minutes into the next hour.
[02:16:32.487 --> 02:16:34.368]  We're going to end transmission after the overdrive.
[02:16:34.648 --> 02:16:37.390]  You'll need to go over to Infowars.com, listen to the streams there.
[02:16:37.430 --> 02:16:40.372]  If you're listening online, you'll be able to hear that extra 20 minutes coming up in about 40.
[02:16:42.664 --> 02:16:53.051]  Going back to Mr. Hoffman, we've spent an hour on this, where I really like your analysis and what I've read you did eight, ten years ago, five years ago.
[02:16:53.932 --> 02:16:56.313]  Yes, folks, I've read his stuff for more than a decade.
[02:16:56.954 --> 02:16:58.475]  I'm not just now discovering all this.
[02:16:59.275 --> 02:17:03.258]  It's just that people have to be more sophisticated in their approach to all of it.
[02:17:03.298 --> 02:17:05.640]  I will not feed into the New World Order's operations.
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:07.901]  I will not be part of it, as a lot of you have been.
[02:17:07.921 --> 02:17:10.583]  And I don't think Mr. Hoffman has it in any way.
[02:17:12.324 --> 02:17:20.892]  I do want to get into their whole twilight language, you know, all the different things that the globalists are doing, some of the allied crime syndicates, where you think their program's going.
[02:17:21.673 --> 02:17:27.739]  And then you also said you'd like to take some calls, so we'll do that in overdrive coming up in the next hour, if you can stay with us.
[02:17:27.939 --> 02:17:30.402]  In fact, I need to ask you, can you stay with us 20 minutes in the next hour?
[02:17:30.962 --> 02:17:31.122]  Yes.
[02:17:31.443 --> 02:17:32.204]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:17:32.224 --> 02:17:32.344]  512-646-5400.
[02:17:32.384 --> 02:17:34.526]  We will open that up in about 30 minutes.
[02:17:34.546 --> 02:17:34.666]  512-646-5400.
[02:17:34.686 --> 02:17:37.610]  You can go ahead and get lined up if you'd like to talk to Mr. Hoffman.
[02:17:45.433 --> 02:18:04.052]  I just wanted to say www.revisionisthistory.org is our website, and I just wanted to finish one tale thought there, Alex, that the roots of Zionist racism are in the Talmud, so for people who claim that
[02:18:04.662 --> 02:18:19.561]  The secular Israelis and secular Zionism couldn't possibly have a religious motivation if you look around to Bolshevik Russia and you see these circumcised Judaics who are inflicting this Holocaust on the Russian Orthodox Church and on Christians there.
[02:18:19.981 --> 02:18:23.102]  They weren't doing it out of simply atheistic motives.
[02:18:23.142 --> 02:18:28.043]  They were doing it out of a religious hate which had been inculcated in them in their youth.
[02:18:28.363 --> 02:18:40.546]  So you can be a secularist as you grow up, but if you always have this sort of cerebral nostalgia, and you see so many times these hyphenated Judaics, if you notice them, or they'll say, well, I'm a Buddhist Jew, or I'm an atheist Jew.
[02:18:40.606 --> 02:18:43.827]  Most of us, if we're Christians, or we're Italians, or we're Irish,
[02:18:44.388 --> 02:18:49.780]  And we go on to a different world, a different strata.
[02:18:50.293 --> 02:18:53.956]  We don't continue to maintain our original identification, but they do.
[02:18:54.116 --> 02:18:56.638]  So here, a lot of them, not all of them, of course.
[02:18:57.359 --> 02:19:10.750]  So what we have here is we have a nationalistic connection which survives even a transmogrification into a new world of Buddha or Tibet or atheism.
[02:19:11.090 --> 02:19:17.135]  They still cling to a racial, national identification with the Israeli state and with their people.
[02:19:17.415 --> 02:19:34.087]  Now there's no doubt, though, that Western Europeans had what they believed was a providence, what they believed was manifest destiny, and that they did use the Torah as an excuse to exterminate the Native Americans.
[02:19:34.347 --> 02:19:40.011]  So there we see something similar to what the Zionists are doing, or similar to what whites were doing with apartheid, with that.
[02:19:40.031 --> 02:19:40.932]  So I just want to make the point
[02:19:41.212 --> 02:19:46.966]  Well, I don't buy the idea that there was an extermination of the American Indians in New England.
[02:19:46.986 --> 02:19:49.453]  I think we'd have to take it century by century.
[02:19:50.186 --> 02:20:03.133]  Certainly, when these Union generals at the end of the war between the states went out there and tried to make the Midwest safe for the railroads and the corporations, yes, there was oppression of the Indians and a lot of lying and a lot of disgusting things going on.
[02:20:03.153 --> 02:20:06.534]  Well, look, I like Andrew Jackson, but I've also got some Native American in me.
[02:20:07.395 --> 02:20:09.196]  Comanche and Cherokee.
[02:20:10.016 --> 02:20:13.378]  So I also like Native Americans, and you know, it was humans.
[02:20:13.678 --> 02:20:15.320]  You could hire natives to kill natives.
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:16.741]  And it was huge battles.
[02:20:16.801 --> 02:20:21.546]  And people say, look at the Indian killer, the native killer, Andrew Jackson, who I like, fought the New World Order.
[02:20:22.027 --> 02:20:25.631]  That was when it was 2 to 1, 3 to 1, 4 to 1, 5 to 1, 10 to 1, fighting the natives.
[02:20:25.651 --> 02:20:28.434]  It wasn't like they were shrinking violet wimps or something.
[02:20:28.934 --> 02:20:34.176]  But the point is, they did say, it's our right to go and take over, it's ours.
[02:20:34.396 --> 02:20:36.437]  My point is, that is a human trait.
[02:20:36.837 --> 02:20:47.001]  I'm just being honed and focused and wicked and vicious through the Zionists, but I'm just saying, I want to, again, let us all recognize this in ourselves, that tribes do this to each other.
[02:20:47.947 --> 02:20:58.990]  Well, that's true, but I think when we're associating Christianity with that and with the Torah, and I want all respect paid to the Torah and to the religion of Jesus Christ, then I don't agree... I'm not attacking that!
[02:20:59.070 --> 02:21:02.551]  I'm saying it was used in Manifest Destiny, was it not?
[02:21:03.511 --> 02:21:04.952]  Well... Was it not cited?
[02:21:06.232 --> 02:21:12.494]  Yeah, Manifest Destiny being different from what the Christians who came to New England were practicing... Oh, well, it was the Christians who freed the slaves!
[02:21:13.394 --> 02:21:14.054]  I understand that.
[02:21:14.074 --> 02:21:17.635]  I'm not saying Christians, so that's a... Stay there, we're going to talk during the break.
[02:21:20.109 --> 02:21:20.969]  You want to flesh that out?
[02:21:21.009 --> 02:21:21.470]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:21:22.311 --> 02:21:28.597]  Puritans fought a war of survival in New England with the Indians, but they made many efforts to convert them.
[02:21:29.157 --> 02:21:32.581]  David Brainerd was one of those people that Jonathan Edwards praised.
[02:21:33.221 --> 02:21:40.248]  And in fact, if you go into what I think is really solving the... But there were abuses in the name of the religion.
[02:21:40.408 --> 02:21:41.029]  Absolutely.
[02:21:41.189 --> 02:21:41.650]  Absolutely.
[02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:42.991]  Every one of us has to keep
[02:21:43.516 --> 02:21:45.757]  A humility about our own selves.
[02:21:46.197 --> 02:21:52.000]  My whole point is, this is silly, and I know you don't agree with that, to say that Jews are inherently evil.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:54.141]  That's the point I'm trying to get at here.
[02:21:54.181 --> 02:21:57.662]  I'm not saying it's not honed and focused and really dangerous and going on.
[02:21:57.742 --> 02:22:05.166]  I'm saying that this is a tribal manifestation put into a hyper-aggressive package.
[02:22:05.765 --> 02:22:25.087]  Yes, and so many Judaics, as you pointed out from your own personal experience, are not affiliated with the Talmud, they're not affiliated with Judaism, but like you and I, it's easy to put a flag in their hand, give them a slogan, and sweep them along with the mob, and that's what's happening to them, because certainly as part of my campaign and my ministry,
[02:22:25.712 --> 02:22:32.756]  First and foremost is an outreach to the Judaic people to liberate them so that they can be more part of the solution.
[02:22:32.816 --> 02:22:40.621]  And I'm sure you're familiar with the fact that you get attacked by some of the neo-Nazis that clothe themselves as more reasonable, claiming you're bad because you want to reach out.
[02:22:40.881 --> 02:22:42.502]  They're saying Jews are inherently evil.
[02:22:43.623 --> 02:22:47.385]  Yeah, and a lot of those people are almost completely insignificant.
[02:22:47.425 --> 02:22:51.408]  They had a higher profile in the past when you saw, for example, the Canadian
[02:22:52.381 --> 02:22:56.385]  Zionists were funding John Beattie, who was running the Canadian Nazi Party.
[02:22:56.646 --> 02:23:01.391]  We've caught German intelligence running the Nazi groups, firebombing the poor Turks.
[02:23:02.031 --> 02:23:03.793]  Then they go, oh, we have to leave your borders open.
[02:23:03.813 --> 02:23:05.054]  You firebomb the Turks.
[02:23:05.095 --> 02:23:06.316]  It turns out it was German intel.
[02:23:06.596 --> 02:23:11.942]  They've had Nazis in Idaho, as you know, who really are being funded by rabbis outhiling Hitler.
[02:23:12.282 --> 02:23:12.843]  Exactly.
[02:23:12.883 --> 02:23:13.864]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:23:14.246 --> 02:23:21.069]  The Aryan Nations in Idaho was one of the greatest FBI listening posts that had ever been established in the United States.
[02:23:21.149 --> 02:23:32.893]  Randy Weaver's family would be alive today had Randy not gone up to Aryan Nations and the real history of Aryan Nations and how the media kept that alive and has really not come out.
[02:23:32.933 --> 02:23:34.734]  Maybe someday there will be a book on it.
[02:23:36.425 --> 02:23:37.026]  Absolutely.
[02:23:37.046 --> 02:23:38.707]  Time for another coffee, thank you.
[02:23:39.388 --> 02:23:45.473]  That's one problem with not having breaks, is that I can't even get my own stimulant here.
[02:23:45.493 --> 02:23:54.401]  I can tell you just as a sideline, Alex, that Timothy McVeigh was up here in our neck of the woods, as you probably know, at the Shadow Hotel.
[02:23:54.421 --> 02:23:55.942]  He was at gun shows here in Austin.
[02:23:55.982 --> 02:23:57.323]  He was everywhere creating that ledger.
[02:23:57.343 --> 02:23:57.624]  Go ahead.
[02:23:58.124 --> 02:24:06.686]  Well, he was with the Keyhole Boys who were implicated in some of the murders where they were knocking off some of the witnesses of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:24:06.786 --> 02:24:14.928]  Oh yeah, and then you also had the bank robberies going on right out of Elohim City that it turned out, official news, Southern Poverty Law Center was running.
[02:24:15.488 --> 02:24:16.448]  Exactly!
[02:24:16.728 --> 02:24:20.289]  Aryan Nations, Neo-Nazi Network, all these patsies.
[02:24:20.993 --> 02:24:29.877]  These buffoons, these child molesters, these gun runners, ex-cons, they were all being funneling into this movement, but at the last minute... Stay there, stay there.
[02:24:30.197 --> 02:24:30.477]  You know what?
[02:24:30.517 --> 02:24:32.418]  Recap that now with the full audience.
[02:24:32.438 --> 02:24:32.698]  Here we go.
[02:24:38.376 --> 02:24:53.085]  We were just talking about how the main Nazi groups, I mean, in the British papers, in the U.S., caught over and over again, not just run, but founded by British intel, German intel, ADL connections, Southern Primary Law Center, it's come out in official FBI documents.
[02:24:54.005 --> 02:24:57.247]  Funding and running Elohim City, the main Nazi compound in Oklahoma.
[02:24:57.587 --> 02:24:59.888]  Tied in with the Rabbis and the Aryan Nations.
[02:25:00.308 --> 02:25:01.729]  Running it in Idaho.
[02:25:02.189 --> 02:25:04.331]  And Mr. Hopkins up there.
[02:25:04.351 --> 02:25:06.872]  This has all come out in the news, but the average American doesn't understand.
[02:25:06.912 --> 02:25:08.853]  Again, they need Nazism.
[02:25:08.873 --> 02:25:10.114]  They need hatred of Jews.
[02:25:10.614 --> 02:25:13.956]  So the controlling group can use the Jews as their slaves.
[02:25:14.796 --> 02:25:15.597]  As a subgroup.
[02:25:15.657 --> 02:25:19.659]  And then they... Very sophisticated, but also very simple in a way.
[02:25:20.279 --> 02:25:21.640]  Elaborate on what you were just saying.
[02:25:22.188 --> 02:25:38.452]  And also keeping, Alex, I'd like to continue that very good point you're making there, also keeping Judaic people who are inside Judaism and who could reveal so much, like some of these Muslims who get out of Islam and they're going around on speaking tours.
[02:25:38.532 --> 02:25:46.394]  We need to have converted former rabbis who are converted to Christ going around the country telling what they know.
[02:25:46.414 --> 02:25:49.535]  Well, that's happened before and they get killed pretty fast.
[02:25:50.563 --> 02:25:52.363]  Well, you know, I'm a positive thinker.
[02:25:52.423 --> 02:25:56.484]  I believe that God is on our side, and as long as He's on our side, who can be against us?
[02:25:56.844 --> 02:25:57.344]  Absolutely.
[02:25:57.844 --> 02:25:59.425]  If God be with us, who can be against us?
[02:26:00.325 --> 02:26:01.105]  You got that right.
[02:26:01.585 --> 02:26:17.828]  So yeah, we were talking about Timothy McVeigh being up here at the Shadows Motel in Spokane, Washington, and he was meeting with the Kehoe Brothers, who were implicated in knocking off some of the witnesses to the Oklahoma City bombing conspiracy, and when this information was presented to the federal judge,
[02:26:18.528 --> 02:26:31.500]  Uh, at the trial there, uh, he ruled it out of evidence, irrelevant, absolutely, because they really didn't want to reveal the role of what you and I are talking about, or how they use these patsies, and they certainly have patsies on the left as well.
[02:26:32.325 --> 02:26:51.641]  uh... the violent uh... animal rights crusaders and uh... well let me know what i mean you ever notice you have to be a provocateur you notice how the groups that claim they're exposing zionism they just freak out attack everybody else cause fights claim people have been kidnapped that haven't just run around wildly uh... they've always got criminal backgrounds they're being handled they're being run
[02:26:52.621 --> 02:27:04.110]  Whereas I'm saying, everybody come together, everybody's human, let's just not be tribal, yeah there's evil mafias, let's, you know, I'm trying to tell listeners, empower yourselves, take action, we can win, we can fight evil.
[02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:07.172]  Notice the other guys, they never do that, it's a key M.O.
[02:27:08.093 --> 02:27:13.657]  Right, and I think that the lesson of the New Testament, at least for me anyway, as a believer is, is that you cannot
[02:27:14.218 --> 02:27:17.281]  Be in contention with these things using carnal weapons.
[02:27:17.721 --> 02:27:19.422]  The system loves violence.
[02:27:19.963 --> 02:27:21.464]  They absolutely feed on it.
[02:27:21.564 --> 02:27:23.325]  And that's why they stage terror attacks.
[02:27:23.365 --> 02:27:25.207]  I love these guys that call me, write me.
[02:27:25.247 --> 02:27:26.348]  You coward, Phil.
[02:27:26.548 --> 02:27:28.870]  You're not calling for guns and shooting people.
[02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:29.891]  You're a coward!
[02:27:30.111 --> 02:27:33.414]  But they're posting on my website.
[02:27:33.454 --> 02:27:37.097]  Then we catch them with the same IP posting, look at this guy threatening.
[02:27:37.257 --> 02:27:38.598]  I'm calling the government.
[02:27:38.638 --> 02:27:40.099]  And the government shows up at my office.
[02:27:40.479 --> 02:27:42.161]  But we know from the IP it's them.
[02:27:42.441 --> 02:27:43.181]  They're feds!
[02:27:44.333 --> 02:27:45.994]  Yeah, they absolutely need this violence.
[02:27:46.034 --> 02:27:47.714]  They need it in the Arab and Muslim world.
[02:27:47.834 --> 02:28:05.641]  Unfortunately, the Muslims have a religion which is oriented towards using carnal weapons against their opponents, so it's much easier to manipulate Muslims than it is to manipulate Christians, although we have so few authentic Christians these days that I suppose in some ways it's become just as easy in either culture.
[02:28:06.294 --> 02:28:06.974]  Well, are you kidding?
[02:28:07.014 --> 02:28:19.402]  A lot of these white Anglo, quote, Zionist, I mean, you'll hear them say, nuke all the Arabs, murder everyone, kill all their children, kill anyone who disagrees with the government and our holy jihad against the jihadis.
[02:28:20.663 --> 02:28:23.144]  And, I mean, they've lost all their soul.
[02:28:23.404 --> 02:28:27.206]  Don't you idiots know that if the government will nuke Muslims, they'll take your bank account?
[02:28:27.567 --> 02:28:34.871]  Don't you know they can kill, I mean, the videos, hundreds of them of our troops shooting Iraqi children for fun and shooting dogs and
[02:28:35.211 --> 02:28:42.379]  Yeah, there's definitely been a process of dehumanization, and as you say, if we're dehumanizing these other people, then we're simply setting ourselves up to be dehumanized as well.
[02:28:56.493 --> 02:28:56.833]  Exactly.
[02:28:56.873 --> 02:28:59.076]  Think how big these hit teams are that are already here.
[02:28:59.356 --> 02:29:09.927]  They have hundreds of thousands of troops, and tens of thousands have been involved in massacres, and they just sit there on the side of the road in Baghdad, shooting cars full of women and children falling out dead, laughing!
[02:29:10.528 --> 02:29:12.970]  I mean, it's not even at a checkpoint!
[02:29:13.251 --> 02:29:17.855]  They just say, watch this, playing Elvis music and shoot families and laugh!
[02:29:18.636 --> 02:29:20.859]  And Blackwater, as you know, has been implicated in that.
[02:29:20.879 --> 02:29:30.991]  And the headline in our North Idaho newspaper was yesterday was that Blackwater may open a chapter in North Idaho because we have a lot of retired policemen, firemen, and military up here.
[02:29:31.011 --> 02:29:36.177]  And, of course, I take my hat off to all genuine public servants who really have protected us from crime.
[02:29:36.958 --> 02:29:55.856]  And things like that, but when you have that kind of military mentality where the government is right and they forget what George Washington and Thomas Jefferson argued for and shed their blood for, then you have these mercenary groups coming in, which is basically, as you know, what we're operating in the Middle East is a mercenary army.
[02:29:55.896 --> 02:30:03.600]  Well that's why day one, a private gets $30,000 a year, a sergeant gets $50,000-$60,000 a year, a colonel gets $1,000,000 a year.
[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:18.347]  It's unknown what the generals get, but they fly in hundreds of billions on giant pallets per year and publicly hand it out off record to the troops, but that's meant to corrupt them, that's meant to get them ready for clandestine
[02:30:18.627 --> 02:30:21.568]  Black Ops, and now they're not professional hitmen in some cases.
[02:30:21.848 --> 02:30:36.134]  They're so bloodthirsty that I've seen the reports in major papers, and I've seen video of it, where there'll be a mother walking with a child and up a .50 cal at, you know, 5,000, not 5,000, 500 yards, and they'll place bets on, can I shoot her in the head?
[02:30:36.374 --> 02:30:44.137]  And her head will explode, and then the child mother falls over with the hand, you know, and then just spraying and shooting and taking puppies and murdering them.
[02:30:44.398 --> 02:30:45.418]  I mean, it's just like, ah!
[02:30:46.098 --> 02:30:53.004]  I mean, that's mind control, and now I want to get into that, because I want to take calls, but we can't just go for 10 hours here.
[02:30:53.024 --> 02:30:55.066]  I mean, you've done so many other subjects.
[02:30:55.086 --> 02:30:58.489]  In fact, let me punch your website up here in front of me.
[02:30:58.529 --> 02:30:59.369]  I mean, there's so many.
[02:31:00.090 --> 02:31:03.012]  I just had it up here on my browser.
[02:31:03.052 --> 02:31:03.893]  Let me find it.
[02:31:05.114 --> 02:31:07.335]  And that's revisionisthistory.org.
[02:31:07.475 --> 02:31:09.316]  Yeah, for some reason it's not in my browser.
[02:31:09.356 --> 02:31:10.697]  Punch it up here on the screen for me, guys.
[02:31:11.917 --> 02:31:18.900]  Because I want to go through different subjects now, quickly, that you also cover, not just one of the big subjects.
[02:31:19.661 --> 02:31:30.786]  One of the things that you mentioned there, Alex, with that violence, and the way that it does damage to Jesus Christ and the Gospel, because obviously Satan does not want the Gospel to spread, doesn't want people to be saved,
[02:31:31.406 --> 02:31:39.629]  We have so many ministers and even Catholic priests, for that matter, who've become neocons, who are preaching this war doctrine.
[02:31:39.649 --> 02:31:41.170]  They're cheering on the massacres.
[02:31:41.570 --> 02:31:46.512]  And the people of the world look on this and they figure, well, these are the public spokesmen for Jesus Christ.
[02:31:46.532 --> 02:31:48.613]  This must be what Jesus Christ represents.
[02:31:48.733 --> 02:31:50.714]  And yet Jesus Christ said, love your enemies.
[02:31:51.034 --> 02:31:52.735]  Do good to them that persecute you.
[02:31:53.355 --> 02:31:58.497]  And the only violence that is allowed to a Christian is not actually violence, but taking up of arms.
[02:31:59.097 --> 02:32:08.745]  Is the police power that the Apostle Paul spoke about, that the ruler bears not the sword in vain to protect our borders, to protect our women from rape, to punish kidnappers.
[02:32:09.165 --> 02:32:22.755]  But we're not allowed, as we've done throughout history, as these secret agents have talked us into, where one Christian nation fights another Christian nation, and the minister gets up in one pulpit and says, God's on our side.
[02:32:22.795 --> 02:32:24.577]  The other minister says, He's on their side.
[02:32:24.597 --> 02:32:27.419]  You had Catholic priests holding masses for the French army.
[02:32:28.039 --> 02:32:31.482]  Opposed to Spanish priests holding masses for their army.
[02:32:31.742 --> 02:32:37.687]  This is all a scandalization of the gospel and it diminishes the stature of Jesus Christ in the world.
[02:32:38.047 --> 02:32:46.254]  And I think that's the most satanic aspect of all of these wars that we have Christian ministers and priests and politicians implicated in their actions.
[02:32:46.254 --> 02:32:48.936]  Again, anything is going to be used throughout history, it always is.
[02:32:49.276 --> 02:33:06.150]  Okay, now, I want to get into the regime of Queen Elizabeth, the first ideological template for the Masonic Imperium and the intelligence agencies of the West, and how that ties into Twilight language, the sub-command-and-control argot of the cryptocracy
[02:33:06.670 --> 02:33:15.816]  The Alchemical Processing of Humanity via Psychodrama Embedded in Ritual Crimes, which we just saw on a high satanic holy day with the murder of Gene Palfrey yesterday.
[02:33:16.177 --> 02:33:18.018]  Let's go through that before I go to calls.
[02:33:18.198 --> 02:33:20.460]  I want to cover this giant area.
[02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:23.222]  I hope you don't want me to do it all in ten minutes.
[02:33:23.802 --> 02:33:25.323]  No, but I mean let's get into it.
[02:33:26.844 --> 02:33:39.489]  Yeah, well with Queen Elizabeth, we briefly touched on her regime last time, and whenever, rule of thumb is whenever you're looking for this occult technology, you want to begin with the intelligence agencies, because that's typically where they're harbored.
[02:33:40.109 --> 02:33:52.233]  And last time I was on your program, Alex, we talked about Dr. John Dee, astrologer royal to Queen Elizabeth I, and with Edward Kelly, he was involved in necromancy and an occult process called scrying.
[02:33:52.253 --> 02:33:54.894]  He was also a legitimate mathematician in his own right.
[02:33:55.735 --> 02:34:03.397]  And his codename, and this will send everybody into orbit when they hear what it was, his codename in the Elizabethan cryptocracy was 007.
[02:34:05.818 --> 02:34:07.799]  And this is the original paradigm of 007.
[02:34:08.659 --> 02:34:22.963]  In fact, people who are in the know on historians of intelligence agencies in the West have remarked upon the fact that the best, most efficient, treacherous, and deadliest of all the secret police forces in the West
[02:34:23.767 --> 02:34:35.672]  ...have been the British Intelligence, MI5 and MI6, and along with Mossad, of course, and all the rest of them from the CIA and the KGB downward are just pale imitations compared to that.
[02:34:35.732 --> 02:34:38.673]  Well, why did they have this power and how did they get it?
[02:34:40.033 --> 02:34:43.575]  In this particular case, John Dee was very much a Kabbalist.
[02:34:43.635 --> 02:34:51.578]  He was fascinated with the Kabbalah, and last time we talked about how the Renaissance Roman Catholics and the Renaissance Anglicans
[02:34:52.319 --> 02:35:04.825]  began to import these Pharisaic ideas into Christendom when the Christians had done such a good job throughout the Middle Ages of keeping these ideas out, and then they entered in in the Renaissance.
[02:35:05.505 --> 02:35:07.686]  And John Dee was obsessed with the Kabbalah.
[02:35:07.726 --> 02:35:13.509]  He felt it was the key to the very highest forms of magic and control of populations and nations.
[02:35:14.269 --> 02:35:17.911]  And so back in the 16th century, he made the very difficult journey
[02:35:18.836 --> 02:35:22.739]  Uh, out to Prague, where he saw Rabbi Jude Law.
[02:35:22.779 --> 02:35:24.440]  Now, I must say, this is conjecture.
[02:35:24.460 --> 02:35:29.084]  I cannot absolutely document that he, per se, met with Jude Law.
[02:35:29.144 --> 02:35:31.886]  He was in occult bohemia at that time.
[02:35:31.906 --> 02:35:37.670]  It would be very hard for me to believe that someone as well-connected as he was going into Prague
[02:35:38.331 --> 02:35:49.216]  And not meeting with Rabbi Giudolo, but so far we have not gotten the smoking gun on the actual meeting itself, so I can't produce letters or diaries that attest to that.
[02:35:49.276 --> 02:35:55.998]  However, the key books which would have that information, they're not even extant in the British libraries.
[02:35:56.138 --> 02:35:57.299]  One of them has been burned up.
[02:35:57.339 --> 02:35:59.700]  You can see the copy, and it's been heavily burned.
[02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:11.372]  Uh, the others have been lost, but one thing we do know, and we need to go by what people practice, that was Jesus' rule of thumb, by their fruits you'll know them, and so what are the fruits of John Dee?
[02:36:11.512 --> 02:36:20.622]  After he returned from Prague, he was filled with this Kabbalistic gnosis, so if he didn't actually meet with Rabbi Judello, who by the way is associated with the mystical golem,
[02:36:21.082 --> 02:36:34.392]  The idea of getting the brainless Goyim, which is what they call the other nations of the world, and getting them to march to your tune, that was actually a philosophical meme or virus of Rabbi Judellot.
[02:36:34.792 --> 02:36:48.842]  So whether or not Dee actually met with him, he certainly picked up the virus and brought it back to Great Britain, where he invented the concept of British Israel, which was a secret teaching that the people of Europe were actually descended from the Ten Tribes.
[02:36:49.242 --> 02:36:58.725]  Now, I actually tend to believe that there is something to that, just because John Dee advocated it, or the Kabbalists and the Rabbis were trying to twist or distort it.
[02:36:58.825 --> 02:37:05.707]  And by the way, that then energizes much of the modern Nazism, and those groups, they all believe that as well.
[02:37:06.446 --> 02:37:14.032]  Well, I have found that most neo-Nazis are very dismissive of British Israel because they're dismissive of the Old Testament as Adolf Hitler was.
[02:37:14.232 --> 02:37:22.478]  Adolf Hitler was basically convinced by the occultists that he dealt with in the Thule Society and the roots of the Thule Society that there was this
[02:37:23.559 --> 02:37:26.321]  Manichaean split between the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[02:37:26.361 --> 02:37:35.827]  It's the heresy of Marcion, where you believe that Jesus was a New Testament figure, and that this terrible Yahweh was this demonic figure of the Old Testament.
[02:37:35.847 --> 02:37:40.851]  The big problem with that is that Jesus quotes the Old Testament numerous times.
[02:37:40.911 --> 02:37:43.072]  Sure, and he says, I'm here to fulfill the whole of the law.
[02:37:43.272 --> 02:37:43.873]  Sure, yeah.
[02:37:43.913 --> 02:37:45.154]  But I mean, let's go back, though.
[02:37:45.194 --> 02:37:45.754]  That's interesting.
[02:37:45.954 --> 02:37:51.358]  Tell me about, from your research, and I've done my own, the type of occultism that Hitler was following.
[02:37:52.173 --> 02:38:04.461]  Well, one of the key aspects of seeing how Hitler was controlled is when you see that when he had state power over the publications of Germany, there's two key indicators for me.
[02:38:05.001 --> 02:38:11.646]  One is the very best Talmud that had ever been published in Germany, the Talmud of Lazarus Goldschmidt.
[02:38:12.310 --> 02:38:22.767]  uh... was published uh... in nazi germany while hitler was the supreme leader uh... they had picked a twelve volume series the last book was published in nineteen thirty six
[02:38:23.362 --> 02:38:28.883]  Publication began in 1929, and Hitler did not interdict the publication of the Talmud.
[02:38:29.183 --> 02:38:46.247]  But even more telling than that is, when Hitler had the focus of the Germanic peoples of the world on him and on his ideology, and he had just a golden opportunity to teach people, what did he hold up for them to learn in terms of advising them about what the inner nature of Zionism
[02:38:46.867 --> 02:38:48.967]  Yeah, it's written in comic book fashion.
[02:39:14.125 --> 02:39:14.665]  Exactly.
[02:39:14.765 --> 02:39:19.267]  And there are a couple of key points, because I believe the Russian secret police had a good handle.
[02:39:19.287 --> 02:39:25.988]  The Russians were probably among the very best students of the rabbis, and they understood rabbinic knowledge.
[02:39:26.029 --> 02:39:30.230]  To this day, the Russians are very alert to the Talmud.
[02:39:30.270 --> 02:39:35.131]  Well, they have the oldest Koran, too, and just shipped a golden copy to Saudi Arabia.
[02:39:35.151 --> 02:39:37.752]  So, yeah, a lot of scholarship going on.
[02:39:38.334 --> 02:39:53.585]  And so, here Hitler holds up the Protocols, has it reprinted, when one of the greatest German scholars of all time, Johann Andreas Eisenmenger, in 1700, had written a book, Endectes Judentum, and it was about Judaism.
[02:39:53.685 --> 02:40:05.253]  It was a two-volume master key into Judaism, which Samuel Wertheimer and Oppenheimer, the financiers of the Holy Roman Empire at that time, had that book suppressed.
[02:40:06.054 --> 02:40:11.118]  And, uh, Eisenmenger had studied with rabbis for 20 years before he wrote the book.
[02:40:11.779 --> 02:40:14.901]  And Hitler could have commissioned a republication of the book.
[02:40:15.482 --> 02:40:18.264]  And there's still more details in that.
[02:40:18.344 --> 02:40:19.906]  Most Germans are not interested in it.
[02:40:19.946 --> 02:40:22.308]  I haven't been able to get Germans very interested in it.
[02:40:22.388 --> 02:40:25.170]  Our publishing company came out with an English version of it.
[02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:35.837]  You can find it at Amazon.com under Traditions of the Jews by Eisenmenger, but it's a one-volume abridgment by a Huguenot minister named Stellan in the 18th century.
[02:40:35.857 --> 02:40:38.258]  It's not the complete book, but it's the best that we could do.
[02:40:38.558 --> 02:40:40.640]  But that's really the master key to Judaism.
[02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:41.540]  What does Hitler do?
[02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:45.423]  He reprints the protocols and ignores Eisenmenger.
[02:40:45.443 --> 02:40:49.105]  Of course, Eisenmenger was a pious Lutheran scholar.
[02:40:49.145 --> 02:40:52.407]  There was nothing racist about him, nothing that you or I would object to.
[02:40:52.747 --> 02:40:53.348]  It would have been a
[02:40:54.208 --> 02:40:58.431]  Benefaction to humanity of the reprint of that book and he didn't do it.
[02:40:58.471 --> 02:41:02.795]  It's just one of a number of factors that you can see in Hitler's outlook
[02:41:03.234 --> 02:41:13.965]  And his attitude of the extirpation and extrusion of the Judaics from Europe, which has been... I mean, he's really the original $6 million man for the state of Israel.
[02:41:14.005 --> 02:41:17.488]  If it wasn't for him, the Israeli state would have never come into being.
[02:41:17.829 --> 02:41:21.512]  It was as a result of sympathy after World War II.
[02:41:21.532 --> 02:41:23.094]  Well, that massive persecution...
[02:41:24.995 --> 02:41:28.157]  But then I get people telling me Hitler wasn't the occult, he was a nice guy.
[02:41:28.177 --> 02:41:38.041]  I mean, you can just look at the guy, but then all the speeches I've read, I've listened to old audio recordings and translations, and the things they did, and the people they shook down.
[02:41:39.061 --> 02:41:45.724]  I mean, just all of it to say that this is a good guy, it just shows the sickening, delusional nature of so many people.
[02:41:46.064 --> 02:41:48.326]  Now, we've got the final segment of the main radio show.
[02:41:48.346 --> 02:41:49.907]  We're going to do about 20 minutes of overdrive.
[02:41:50.327 --> 02:41:55.330]  I really want to get into Twilight Language, the sub-rosa command-and-control argot of the cryptocracy.
[02:41:55.691 --> 02:41:57.432]  There is no doubt they're following this.
[02:41:57.452 --> 02:42:00.934]  There's no doubt they're pulling games and doing all sorts of bizarre things.
[02:42:01.335 --> 02:42:04.777]  I want to talk about that during this InfoWars.com segment.
[02:42:05.037 --> 02:42:08.259]  On the InfoWars.com streams, you'll be able to listen to the next three minutes.
[02:42:08.279 --> 02:42:11.361]  We'll come back in the final segment, and I've got a few sponsors I want to plug.
[02:42:12.222 --> 02:42:15.524]  Back and go into some other subjects and your phone calls at 512-646-5400.
[02:42:15.604 --> 02:42:20.086]  And we'll be leaving the network in about 10 minutes.
[02:42:20.126 --> 02:42:21.587]  I want to thank them for the great work they've done.
[02:42:21.607 --> 02:42:25.929]  If you want to continue listening, there's one place, the internet at InfoWars.com.
[02:42:29.851 --> 02:42:30.752]  Okay.
[02:42:31.552 --> 02:42:34.013]  Boy, this time has just blasted past us.
[02:42:34.654 --> 02:42:37.175]  Let's get into defining what Twilight Language is.
[02:42:37.215 --> 02:42:41.097]  Give us the basics of that and then get into some examples of its implementation and usage.
[02:42:41.926 --> 02:42:48.393]  Well, I think, Alex, one of the reasons why our people are so passive right now, there's an eerie silence out in the hinterland.
[02:42:48.433 --> 02:42:50.476]  You know, Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill...
[02:42:51.149 --> 02:42:57.974]  Was part of the bombing of Serbia, where Christian churches and monasteries were destroyed, supposedly to liberate Kosovo.
[02:42:58.715 --> 02:43:12.906]  And if something like that had been done by an American president, say, downtown Tel Aviv, as was done to Belgrade, you can be sure that if his wife was then running for president, everywhere he or his wife went around the United States, they would have encountered a crowd
[02:43:13.527 --> 02:43:17.709]  of angry Tel Aviv residents who said, look what you did, firebombing our town.
[02:43:18.209 --> 02:43:23.311]  But we don't see crowds of Serbian Christians... With depleted uranium, they didn't just blow up everything.
[02:43:23.731 --> 02:43:32.934]  Yeah, but we don't see Serbian Christians following around Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, and I'm not advocating any violence here, but just asking them tough questions, protest, and picket signs.
[02:43:33.374 --> 02:43:39.456]  There's this incredible apathy on the part of our people, and I believe it's been instilled, and it's instilled in a number of ways.
[02:43:39.536 --> 02:43:41.137]  Twilight language is one of them.
[02:43:41.644 --> 02:43:46.930]  And Twilight Language is basically a way to talk over our heads directly to our subconscious.
[02:43:47.430 --> 02:43:52.816]  And one of the movies, it's kind of R-rated, so I don't recommend it for people under the age of 18.
[02:43:53.317 --> 02:43:56.160]  Kids shouldn't see it, you know, but mature adults can see it.
[02:43:56.220 --> 02:43:57.261]  It's called They Live.
[02:43:57.984 --> 02:44:07.697]  And in the movie they live for some reason the director mentioned that the glasses that you can put on to decode this subliminal twilight language are called the Hoffman lenses.
[02:44:08.138 --> 02:44:12.464]  And to this day I don't know whether he was a fan of my book or it's just a synchronicity.
[02:44:12.944 --> 02:44:18.392]  But that movie brings out some of the aspects, but of course it's a lot more technical than that.
[02:44:18.492 --> 02:44:22.918]  But the idea is that you implant in people certain key words.
[02:44:22.958 --> 02:44:23.739]  I'll give you one of them.
[02:44:23.899 --> 02:44:24.260]  Wicker.
[02:44:24.741 --> 02:44:25.602]  Okay, wicker.
[02:44:25.802 --> 02:44:28.326]  You were talking about the Druids at the start of the program.
[02:44:28.786 --> 02:44:33.731]  And wicker has to do with the historic method of immolation of a ritual victim.
[02:44:33.771 --> 02:44:39.937]  You put them inside of a wicker basket, and something like that goes on at the Burning Man Rite in Nevada every year.
[02:44:39.977 --> 02:44:44.361]  They're out at Black Rock, and I think Black Rock, even that word is symbolic.
[02:44:44.962 --> 02:44:50.127]  But, um... On the sacrificial stone, and of course most of the people there don't know what it is, but go ahead.
[02:44:50.717 --> 02:45:03.342]  Yeah, and so, in our subconscious, it's my theory, based on information, for example, from Dr. Carl Gustav Jung, and... Well, there's no doubt that there are these pre-programmed, almost ancestral memories.
[02:45:03.382 --> 02:45:05.563]  Now, I'm not saying a reincarnation, folks.
[02:45:05.643 --> 02:45:09.504]  I mean, pre-programmed, like, you know, why are the kids afraid of the dark?
[02:45:09.544 --> 02:45:12.845]  Why do they want to be near you at night, so a big cat doesn't come in the cave and eat them?
[02:45:13.105 --> 02:45:14.426]  There's these basic instincts.
[02:45:14.446 --> 02:45:14.726]  Go ahead.
[02:45:15.137 --> 02:45:17.160]  Yeah, you and I don't believe in reincarnation.
[02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:22.246]  The orthodox rabbis do, of course, and it's unbelievable that Christians... I'll tell you, we're coming back.
[02:45:22.267 --> 02:45:22.787]  We're coming back.
[02:45:22.867 --> 02:45:23.748]  Recap that now.
[02:45:24.289 --> 02:45:25.731]  I've got to plug some things and recap it.
[02:45:25.751 --> 02:45:27.413]  We'll start the extra hour, okay?
[02:45:27.894 --> 02:45:28.154]  Okay.
[02:45:28.174 --> 02:45:28.435]  Thank you.

[02:46:18.364 --> 02:46:21.466]  And just be scholars, but also be active.
[02:46:22.627 --> 02:46:26.369]  Before we go back to Mr. Hoffman with amazing information, and who knows how long he can stay with us.
[02:46:26.589 --> 02:46:28.530]  I might keep him for another hour if he can do it.
[02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:30.631]  But I've got to get home and do some other work.
[02:46:30.651 --> 02:46:31.551]  I've hardly been home this week.
[02:46:31.571 --> 02:46:32.372]  I've been working so much.
[02:46:33.412 --> 02:46:35.134]  Uh, but we've got work for the Raptors.
[02:46:35.154 --> 02:46:36.515]  I've got two new films coming out.
[02:46:36.835 --> 02:46:39.417]  I think the film that I'm just about to complete is the best I've ever made.
[02:46:39.437 --> 02:46:41.638]  And it was really meant to be just a quick film.
[02:46:41.778 --> 02:46:42.939]  It's a real sleeper.
[02:46:43.299 --> 02:46:43.960]  Wait till you see it.
[02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:45.701]  But I'm already digressing there.
[02:46:46.302 --> 02:46:48.423]  I want to tell you about some of our sponsors.
[02:46:48.743 --> 02:46:51.745]  And one of those is Aloe Ease.
[02:46:52.964 --> 02:46:59.292]  And folks, Aloe is just one of the many products that New Vitality carry.
[02:47:00.974 --> 02:47:02.476]  It's a big, established company.
[02:47:02.496 --> 02:47:08.604]  They don't have magic claims or baloney like these stupid ads that claim that crystals will heal you or whatever.
[02:47:08.644 --> 02:47:10.707]  This is just really good stuff that's known.
[02:47:11.107 --> 02:47:11.427]  Thank you.
[02:47:28.396 --> 02:47:31.419]  A lot of men have prostate problems with all the chemicals and stuff in our diet.
[02:47:31.779 --> 02:47:35.122]  These are well-known herbs that shrink the prostate and make it healthy.
[02:47:35.643 --> 02:47:37.424]  A lot of this stuff is even doctor-recommended now.
[02:47:37.785 --> 02:47:41.708]  They know these herbs are very well-designed by God and really work well.
[02:47:41.728 --> 02:47:43.590]  1-800-569-4056 or check out the banner to newvitality at infowars.com.

[02:47:53.816 --> 02:47:55.477]  That's how we finance our operation.
[02:47:55.497 --> 02:47:56.457]  I'm getting a bigger office.
[02:47:56.477 --> 02:47:59.338]  I'm going to try to hire more people, do a better job.
[02:47:59.838 --> 02:48:03.139]  Maybe get some other folks to do TV programs in the morning and at night with a nice setup.
[02:48:03.239 --> 02:48:05.840]  Get on a cable channel that isn't as expensive as you think.
[02:48:06.220 --> 02:48:07.721]  But we need the funds to do that.
[02:48:08.381 --> 02:48:11.162]  And again, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:11.182 --> 02:48:12.222]  Buy the books and videos there.
[02:48:12.542 --> 02:48:14.623]  Watch the films online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:15.363 --> 02:48:16.664]  Or you can simply
[02:48:18.150 --> 02:48:18.290]  I think?
[02:48:48.993 --> 02:48:53.136]  I am going to start a fifth hour of overdrive, and you know what?
[02:48:53.156 --> 02:48:54.057]  I'm just going to do 30 minutes.
[02:48:54.097 --> 02:48:57.700]  I'm going to respect Mr. Hoffman's time, and I respect my own time and your time.
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:07.628]  So we're going to come back, try to get more into this whole Masonic system and the whole British angle on it, the Britannic angle, and then Twilight language.
[02:49:08.749 --> 02:49:09.690]  Let's get into that first.
[02:49:09.770 --> 02:49:15.535]  Amazing, very, very important with Mr. Hoffman when we start the next hour.
[02:49:16.315 --> 02:49:19.157]  But I want to officially start that next hour coming in with the intro.
[02:49:19.177 --> 02:49:21.038]  So we'll go to Mr. Hoffman in one moment.
[02:49:21.378 --> 02:49:25.961]  Right now though, I need to let Mr. Hoffman know we need to call him back on his number.
[02:49:26.341 --> 02:49:32.185]  So John, will you please IM that number to my producer Ian Austin.
[02:49:32.845 --> 02:49:35.447]  And Mr. Hoffman, we will call you back in 60 seconds.
[02:49:35.507 --> 02:49:36.087]  Is that okay?
[02:49:36.527 --> 02:49:37.348]  Yes, that's fine Alex.
[02:49:37.668 --> 02:49:39.429]  Okay, and then we can have you for 30 minutes, correct?
[02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:40.130]  Yes.
[02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:42.591]  Okay, we're going to call you on our number now.
[02:49:42.611 --> 02:49:43.812]  We're going to talk about 15 minutes.
[02:49:44.112 --> 02:49:47.955]  Then we'll take 15 minutes of calls from Josh, Will, Kyle, Eric, Todd, and others.
[02:49:48.215 --> 02:49:49.316]  The radio show continues.
[02:49:49.336 --> 02:49:52.698]  I want to thank all the MFM affiliates, Shorewood affiliates, Main Satellite.
[02:49:52.718 --> 02:49:53.699]  We'll say bye-bye to you now.
[02:49:54.039 --> 02:49:55.920]  Back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:49:57.781]  live for another syndicated show.
[02:49:57.902 --> 02:50:01.064]  But the internet TV show continues now at InfoWars.com.
[02:50:01.304 --> 02:50:04.566]  You'll need to go to those audio streams right now to be able to hear us.

[02:50:14.815 --> 02:50:15.376]  Take care, Jones.
[02:50:15.396 --> 02:50:16.637]  We'll see you on Monday.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.361]  John, fabulous job.
[02:50:20.541 --> 02:50:21.002]  Thank you.
[02:50:21.182 --> 02:50:21.682]  Thank you, sir.
[02:50:21.702 --> 02:50:22.223]  Have a nice weekend.
[02:50:22.890 --> 02:50:31.319]  comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:50:31.679 --> 02:50:42.351]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:50:42.731 --> 02:50:45.914]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:50:46.134 --> 02:50:47.856]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:50:47.896 --> 02:50:53.640]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[02:50:54.041 --> 02:50:59.245]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:50:59.445 --> 02:51:09.254]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[02:51:09.654 --> 02:51:11.935]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:51:12.295 --> 02:51:17.636]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:51:22.297 --> 02:51:24.458]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:28.219 --> 02:51:30.220]  Genetics dominated the 20th century.
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:35.241]  Its ruthless spirit has now metastasized into the fields of genetics.
[02:51:41.010 --> 02:51:41.590]  We're good to go.
[02:52:06.454 --> 02:52:09.519]  Alright, Houston's giving us clearance here at Cape Canaveral.
[02:52:09.539 --> 02:52:14.846]  We're go launch into overdrive, commercial free, for the next 30 minutes.
[02:52:15.707 --> 02:52:18.812]  My wife's gonna kill me if I don't stop doing 5, 6, 8 hour radio shows.
[02:52:19.212 --> 02:52:20.534]  I tell you, I do this because I love it.
[02:52:21.716 --> 02:52:22.136]  But I...
[02:52:24.198 --> 02:52:33.505]  I just have always smelled a New World Order operation in and around, just going after certain groups of people, because that actually empowers the New World Order.
[02:52:33.525 --> 02:52:48.956]  All right, I want to move quickly through Twilight Language, the Sub Rosa command and control argot of the cryptocracy, then we'll go to these loaded phone lines for Michael Hoffman, our guest, who is a former AP writer, best-selling author, researcher, calls himself a revisionist historian.
[02:52:49.896 --> 02:52:51.498]  Let's go back to our guest.
[02:52:51.518 --> 02:52:53.159]  Mr. Hoffman, break it down for us.
[02:52:53.666 --> 02:53:00.828]  Yes, I'm wondering if just before I do, Alex, if I could brief people on our website and the publications, is that okay?
[02:53:00.928 --> 02:53:02.209]  Oh, sure, yeah!
[02:53:02.249 --> 02:53:04.130]  They're all going to visit and brief themselves, but go ahead.
[02:53:04.590 --> 02:53:12.392]  So we're at www.revisionisthistory.org, and the book that I'm finishing up now is Judaism Discovered.
[02:53:12.672 --> 02:53:23.336]  It should be available, we should be mailing it out in July, but we'll be having a pre-publication sale probably at the beginning of June, so if people stay on our mailing list and stay with us,
[02:53:23.888 --> 02:53:29.993]  They can get five or six dollars off the price on that, and that's really everything that I've got I've put into that book.
[02:53:30.033 --> 02:53:38.040]  I've been writing it for a year, researching it for the last eight years, and that's... And again, this is all the rage, Madonna, everything else, we're just looking at it.
[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:38.960]  Go ahead.
[02:53:39.501 --> 02:53:40.482]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:53:40.942 --> 02:53:52.652]  And so our address is Independent History, PO Box 849, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, 83816, and the website is revisionisthistory.org.
[02:53:53.487 --> 02:54:00.153]  And we were talking about Twilight Language, and Alex and I were discussing wicker as being one of the command words.
[02:54:01.134 --> 02:54:10.963]  Earlier in the previous show that I did, I talked about how people are aware that Egypt involves, the ancient Egyptians and pharaonic Egypt involves archaeoastronomy.
[02:54:11.761 --> 02:54:25.649]  And the mystical toponomy of that area, the ley lines and how the statuary is laid out, but very few people know the emphasis that the Egyptians put on the use of words, words of power, which Freemasonry is also aware of.
[02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:32.874]  The Freemasons have a symbolic figure they call Dr. Syntax, and they have him lecturing at Freemasons Hall, which is the tip-off
[02:54:33.314 --> 02:54:39.361]  That there are these key words and of course every Mason knows that there are phrases and secret passwords.
[02:54:39.501 --> 02:54:40.482]  Are you on the level?
[02:54:40.582 --> 02:54:41.644]  We meet on the square.
[02:54:41.744 --> 02:54:46.669]  Many of those having been part of the regular argot of Americans.
[02:54:47.010 --> 02:54:50.073]  So ubiquitous was the influence of Freemasonry in the 20th century.
[02:54:51.014 --> 02:54:59.720]  This goes a little bit deeper than that because we're talking about an attempt to speak to our unconscious or dreaming mind, which is awake when we are asleep.
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:03.622]  But so many people are awake or are asleep even when they're awake.
[02:55:03.682 --> 02:55:11.207]  And I think probably some of you driving on the highways and freeways will be aware of that with people with their cell phones and all these distractions.
[02:55:11.687 --> 02:55:18.612]  But the point of a magician, of course, to work his illusion is to draw our attention away from the real trick.
[02:55:19.259 --> 02:55:23.906]  And so much of what the cryptocracy Alex is involved in today is misdirection.
[02:55:24.707 --> 02:55:34.021]  And in the meanwhile, they salt our media, our public relations, with these keywords which are intended to instill in us amnesia,
[02:55:34.628 --> 02:55:36.189]  Apathy and ebulia.
[02:55:36.309 --> 02:55:38.031]  Ebulia means lack of will.
[02:55:38.071 --> 02:55:40.253]  And we certainly see all... And let me just throw this in.
[02:55:40.293 --> 02:55:46.558]  They also do things, and there's many levels and facets, but as George Orwell said, destroying the language, reducing it.
[02:55:46.998 --> 02:56:00.428]  They'll call someone who murders 55 children with a bomb a extremist, which is a... or a radical, which is a term that doesn't describe a cold-blooded murderer of a piece of filth, you know, a terrorist.
[02:56:01.329 --> 02:56:20.696]  They will prescribe a word that is not as serious to something serious so they can then use it to people who aren't even quote extreme but now it has the mental idea that oh my god this person's a murdering terrorist that way they can call you an extremist and not get sued when they're really calling you a murdering killer.
[02:56:20.896 --> 02:56:22.857]  I mean see all those little mind games they play?
[02:56:23.317 --> 02:56:28.719]  Yeah, language is really the key of it and who controls the language for example how the word
[02:56:29.232 --> 02:56:35.237]  The neologism Holocaust was introduced into our vocabulary prior to the late 1960s, early 70s.
[02:56:35.297 --> 02:56:41.202]  Most people talked about the genocide as Raphael Lemkin coined it, which was also a neologism.
[02:56:41.522 --> 02:56:43.384]  Or they just referred to the six million.
[02:56:43.804 --> 02:56:47.027]  And suddenly this term Holocaust, which means burnt offering,
[02:56:47.406 --> 02:56:53.810]  Was being applied to people who did not die generally by fire as it's alleged, but they died allegedly by gas.
[02:57:18.027 --> 02:57:37.810]  Yeah, well, Twilight Language, if you look on the internet and search around for Twilight Language, you're either going to bump into my research, or you're going to bump into a technical term that's used in Buddhist and Tantric and Hindu manuscripts to talk about the concealment of text which are not allowed for initiates to access.
[02:57:38.294 --> 02:57:46.701]  But Twilight Language, as used in that Buddhist-Hindu context, does not really involve manipulation of the unconscious or dreaming mind.
[02:57:46.781 --> 02:58:04.456]  It's a little bit there in Tantra, but mostly it's a technical term for how texts are concealed, which is of interest to me in my study of Judaism, because one of the theses that I bring out in my new book is that even some of the texts in the Talmud were deliberately planted there in case Gentiles penetrated through
[02:58:05.098 --> 02:58:11.962]  The Aramaic began to understand and got access to the text, but we'll leave that for another time or for when my book is published.
[02:58:12.302 --> 02:58:15.944]  But in this peculiar case of Twilight Language in the West, Alex...
[02:58:16.417 --> 02:58:22.080]  That's the manipulation of archetypes, and I want to give you an example because I think that's the best way for people to understand it.
[02:58:22.140 --> 02:58:22.860]  Darth Vader?
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:24.121]  How are police now dressed?
[02:58:24.381 --> 02:58:28.183]  And then a police chief in a major city saying they wear it to intimidate us?
[02:58:28.283 --> 02:58:28.903]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:58:29.083 --> 02:58:31.224]  Yeah, sure, no, that's part of it.
[02:58:31.384 --> 02:58:38.048]  And that would be more the language of symbolism rather than the verbum.
[02:58:38.168 --> 02:58:40.169]  But a verb brings up a mental image.
[02:58:40.697 --> 02:58:41.458]  Yes, that's right.
[02:58:41.538 --> 02:58:43.599]  It triggers it, sure.
[02:58:44.040 --> 02:59:05.838]  And so, as we were talking when we were on the national radio there, we were talking about how wicker is related to the ancient pre-Christian northern European means of immolation for ritual sacrifice, which was to put someone into a large anthropomorphic, that is to say, man-shaped wicker basket and set it on fire.
[02:59:06.337 --> 02:59:13.505]  And then we were talking about how there were parallels between that and the Burning Man rituals that are done out in the Nevada desert at Black Rock.
[02:59:14.065 --> 02:59:24.476]  But if we look at Wicker, and again, people can do an internet search or they can do this research on their own to see how much the wicker is associated with the occult and associated with ritual murder.
[02:59:25.077 --> 02:59:27.880]  And when I was part of the regular establishment media,
[02:59:28.567 --> 02:59:35.891]  Uh, one of the stories that I was covering was the son of Sam murders, which I'm sure you'll recall with the son of Sam called David Berkowitz was the past.
[02:59:35.951 --> 02:59:37.251]  Yeah, going around shooting people.
[02:59:37.592 --> 02:59:37.952]  Yeah.
[02:59:38.032 --> 02:59:43.795]  He, he, well, terrorizing New York with these very occult letters, which were not written by David Berkowitz.
[02:59:43.835 --> 02:59:45.135]  They weren't in his handwriting.
[02:59:45.175 --> 02:59:47.297]  He wasn't capable intellectually of writing them.
[02:59:47.337 --> 02:59:49.198]  And he now admits that himself.
[02:59:50.098 --> 02:59:55.961]  Unfortunately, Maury Terry, the lead investigator on that has muddied the waters in certain significant ways.
[02:59:56.693 --> 03:00:02.117]  Uh, which is very unfortunate because about 90% of his book is correct and then 10% is misdirection.
[03:00:02.617 --> 03:00:09.541]  But, uh, the son of Sam called himself Wicked King Wicker for absolutely no reason.
[03:00:09.621 --> 03:00:20.028]  And the letters to Jimmy Breslin, which were subsequently publicized across the nation, first in the New York Daily News and later in Newsweek and Time and CBS and so forth,
[03:00:20.841 --> 03:00:31.045]  Uh, this name, Wicked King Wicker, came to be associated with the most electrifying ritual serial murder series, uh, really of that era.
[03:00:31.105 --> 03:00:32.906]  The Son of Sam, uh, thing.
[03:00:32.946 --> 03:00:45.931]  If you talk to native New Yorkers, uh, who were living in Manhattan or any one of the five, uh, boroughs at that time, uh, they feared Son of Sam and, uh, they began to associate, subconsciously, Wicker with Son of Sam.
[03:00:46.491 --> 03:00:48.332]  And I followed this Wicker trail
[03:00:49.026 --> 03:00:53.148]  And they use it later on.
[03:00:53.188 --> 03:01:01.993]  There was a movie set in Chicago and it was on ritual murder and brought in this wicker thing for absolutely no reason at all.
[03:01:02.093 --> 03:01:08.576]  So it's clear that they want to associate the ancient connotations of wicker with the modern.
[03:01:08.596 --> 03:01:10.858]  So what's the message?
[03:01:10.898 --> 03:01:12.378]  What's the message of the Twilight language?
[03:01:12.398 --> 03:01:15.380]  What they're saying is that these aren't just random murders.
[03:01:15.802 --> 03:01:19.263]  By lone nuts, even though consciously, that's what we're telling you.
[03:01:19.684 --> 03:01:21.664]  Officially, we're telling you this.
[03:01:22.365 --> 03:01:27.447]  Unofficially, in the shadow side, in the mirror side, we're telling you something else.
[03:01:27.927 --> 03:01:40.372]  Now, in the old days, when we were a hearty, vigorous, alert people, things like that would get people angry, they would get them curious, they would start investigating, and they'd do something about it.
[03:01:40.392 --> 03:01:42.753]  There'd be arrests, there'd be prosecutions, you know?
[03:01:43.780 --> 03:01:52.506]  Nowadays, the way we've been dumbed down, the way our will has been taken from us, all this does is to continue to murder our mind.
[03:01:52.966 --> 03:01:56.949]  The more we see their control, the more we stand in awe of them.
[03:01:57.289 --> 03:01:58.650]  And we don't actually act.
[03:01:59.130 --> 03:02:08.336]  As far as I'm concerned, Charles Harrelson is very likely one of the men who assassinated John Fitzgerald Kennedy on November 22nd in Dallas.
[03:02:08.816 --> 03:02:11.238]  Charles Harrelson is in a federal prison.
[03:02:12.086 --> 03:02:12.746]  There should be.
[03:02:12.927 --> 03:02:14.548]  Well, he actually died just a few months ago.
[03:02:14.568 --> 03:02:15.248]  You may not have known that.
[03:02:15.268 --> 03:02:22.372]  And of course, that's Woody Harrelson's dad, and he was convicted for shooting a federal judge in San Antonio at 400 yards with a .243 in the neck.
[03:02:22.772 --> 03:02:24.193]  We know he did hits all over the world.
[03:02:24.253 --> 03:02:29.856]  And the Dallas Times Herald, now defunct, has famous photos of him being brought out with the tramps.
[03:02:30.217 --> 03:02:31.857]  He was one of the guys, and it's Charles Harrelson.
[03:02:31.878 --> 03:02:32.178]  Go ahead.
[03:02:32.458 --> 03:02:34.639]  Okay, so he died a couple of months ago.
[03:02:34.679 --> 03:02:35.960]  Yes, that's news to me.
[03:02:36.778 --> 03:02:52.269]  And when I confronted Woody Harrelson with this, because I had seen that he had made the statement that his father was a CIA agent, and I had also heard that when Charles Harrelson was arrested for the murder of the federal judge, he said, you can't touch me, I killed Kennedy.
[03:02:52.949 --> 03:03:00.214]  And so I was able to arrange a meeting with Woody Harrelson, and he's an environmental activist.
[03:03:00.294 --> 03:03:02.635]  No, I know Woody, I'm in a movie with him, I've hung out with him.
[03:03:03.932 --> 03:03:06.635]  Okay, I don't know whether you asked him this question or not.
[03:03:06.695 --> 03:03:09.578]  No, I was just saying, I was saying yes, I know he's really into the environment.
[03:03:09.618 --> 03:03:09.859]  Go ahead.
[03:03:10.239 --> 03:03:22.912]  Yeah, and so I felt that this was an opportunity given to me by God to encourage Woody to get his father to speak so that any perpetrators who are still alive we can bring to justice because that's where I'm at.
[03:03:23.493 --> 03:03:24.234]  You know when he died?
[03:03:24.274 --> 03:03:26.475]  He died right, it was actually about almost a year ago now.
[03:03:26.795 --> 03:03:28.857]  It was right when the Rolling Stone came out.
[03:03:29.577 --> 03:03:31.018]  You know, I've had St.
[03:03:31.058 --> 03:03:39.324]  John Hunt, the son of the famous CIA Section Chief, CIA Black Ops Commander E. Howard Hunt, with all the tapes, we've even got video that we need to go ahead and get on the web.
[03:03:39.785 --> 03:03:44.248]  So dangerous, but the audio's already out of him saying how he ran the operation to kill Kennedy, but go ahead.
[03:03:44.804 --> 03:04:04.999]  You see, what's happening is, in other words, I could have just gotten Woody's autograph, and like a lot of your listeners, I'm interested in natural foods, and we could have discussed that, but I threw all that away in order to take the opportunity to confront him about his dad, and all he basically did was start crying, and he got very angry, and that ended the whole interview there.
[03:04:06.106 --> 03:04:08.348]  It's obviously a very sore subject with him.
[03:04:08.368 --> 03:04:09.529]  Yeah, you don't bring it up, Jim.
[03:04:09.689 --> 03:04:12.931]  But, well, you have to because, you know, he wants to better the world.
[03:04:13.032 --> 03:04:21.598]  What could be more betterment of the world than to solve this mystery and bring this horrible octopus that's behind the killing of this president to justice?
[03:04:22.038 --> 03:04:23.039]  And that's really...
[03:04:23.679 --> 03:04:25.741]  What I feel we should all be involved in.
[03:04:25.781 --> 03:04:34.427]  Now, maybe my way isn't your way or another individual's way, but each of us have to be involved in a practical application of this.
[03:04:34.487 --> 03:04:42.713]  And what I see, Alex, is that the conspiracy movement, the study of the occult, it's become a thrill-seeking movement.
[03:04:42.913 --> 03:04:49.478]  It seems to be that the vast majority of the people involved are no longer actually trying to bring perpetrators to justice.
[03:04:49.958 --> 03:05:01.125]  They're actually part of an occult roller coaster ride, which continues to dish out various revelations to them, because they're basically almost as dead as Frankenstein monster in the modern world.
[03:05:01.726 --> 03:05:14.394]  They sit in traffic for two hours, they commute home, they eat dead food when they get home, switch on the boob tube, and the occult, the study of these mysteries, is kind of like an electric shock to Frankenstein's monster.
[03:05:14.554 --> 03:05:15.035]  No, no, no.
[03:05:15.295 --> 03:05:16.536]  Listen, I love that analogy.
[03:05:17.036 --> 03:05:28.105]  Everything's so dead, everything's a lie, so the truth is like a moth to a flame, but you don't want to get burned by it, and the leadership of it is everyone saying, only I have the answer, and you're all scum.
[03:05:28.426 --> 03:05:32.449]  I always work with everyone, but most people, there's very few quality people at the higher levels.
[03:05:32.489 --> 03:05:34.711]  I think you're a quality gentleman person, very intelligent.
[03:05:35.291 --> 03:05:42.195]  Uh, but I've tried to reach a handout to so many who always backstab me or flip out or say I'm covering up something when I have everybody on, basically.
[03:05:42.855 --> 03:05:45.577]  Uh, but I mean, more than that, it's like a money-making thing.
[03:05:45.797 --> 03:05:48.018]  And I don't mean just to have an office and operate and make films.
[03:05:48.058 --> 03:05:55.302]  I mean, they're really, you know, I refuse the magic riot machines and all the crap pyramids and all the magic cures and all these other things.
[03:05:56.042 --> 03:05:59.185]  You know, like other people, they accept it because they love the power.
[03:05:59.545 --> 03:06:04.229]  They're also mad, as conspiracy leaders, that I'm the big fish and really hate me.
[03:06:04.589 --> 03:06:09.994]  I've experienced it, where I could care less about crowds and people, and I wish, at many levels, I never would have done this.
[03:06:11.095 --> 03:06:17.560]  And I'm a very private person, and I don't need ego, because I already, you know, am self-confident, you know, myself.
[03:06:17.600 --> 03:06:19.182]  But yes, I know a very sick movement.
[03:06:19.602 --> 03:06:21.584]  But at the top, it's sick, like everything else.
[03:06:22.024 --> 03:06:24.486]  In the middle and the bottom, it's great people waking up.
[03:06:24.847 --> 03:06:41.381]  Some people, it's like entertainment and funny, and ooh, look at this, and that's why they always get into the next thing, the UFO, the chupacabra, the turkey monster, the Loch Ness monster, the aliens, because it is a thrill-seeking voyeurism, and then it strays off the path.
[03:06:41.761 --> 03:06:43.863]  I always try to stay in the reality.
[03:06:44.524 --> 03:06:45.565]  Do you see the points I'm making?
[03:06:45.965 --> 03:06:55.438]  Yes, and I think that's important to make those distinctions because it can be a kind of infotainment and just a thrill ride and that's very deadening because
[03:06:56.073 --> 03:06:59.034]  Alex, the cryptocracy is not static.
[03:06:59.154 --> 03:07:02.755]  They move us from stage to stage in their human processing.
[03:07:03.095 --> 03:07:03.995]  It's like downloads.
[03:07:04.035 --> 03:07:05.555]  They give us the new download.
[03:07:05.575 --> 03:07:06.836]  You can even see the new info.
[03:07:07.016 --> 03:07:14.858]  We're now moving into the phase of artificial scarcity, cutting off water, cutting off food, tripling, quadrupling, the bureaucrats micromanaging.
[03:07:14.878 --> 03:07:20.059]  Scarcity is a very important model to impose on people because it's part of spreading fear.
[03:07:20.748 --> 03:07:26.235]  You know, Charlie Manson talked about the need to spread the fear, and he picked that up from the cryptocracy itself.
[03:07:26.396 --> 03:07:28.859]  And the only thing we are to be afraid of is God.
[03:07:28.919 --> 03:07:34.947]  If anyone tries to get you to be afraid of anything else other than God, you're dealing with a pied piper right there.
[03:07:35.948 --> 03:07:38.069]  They say the beginning of knowledge is the fear of God.
[03:07:38.109 --> 03:07:40.229]  That means the beginning of fearing the devil is the beginning of ignorance.
[03:07:40.730 --> 03:07:42.810]  I tell people, be afraid of not living a full life.
[03:07:42.850 --> 03:07:44.911]  Be afraid of not having honor and courage.
[03:07:45.171 --> 03:07:46.631]  Be afraid of not fighting evil.
[03:07:46.692 --> 03:07:47.952]  Be afraid of letting it win.
[03:07:48.292 --> 03:07:51.833]  Be afraid of not charging out on the field and engaging the enemy.
[03:07:52.813 --> 03:08:00.416]  Be afraid of not being the creature you should have been, and you better be afraid of not fighting this corruption.
[03:08:03.819 --> 03:08:05.320]  People say I try to create fear.
[03:08:05.680 --> 03:08:06.401]  It's the opposite.
[03:08:06.481 --> 03:08:12.867]  I'm trying to empower people, and I'm trying to say scary things are going to happen if you do not get involved.
[03:08:12.887 --> 03:08:14.268]  You see that difference there?
[03:08:14.948 --> 03:08:20.233]  If they ever really saw a revolution developing, or as soon as they even begin to see an inkling or a harbinger of it,
[03:08:20.615 --> 03:08:28.457]  They go to Fox News and they get a fear factor going, you know, we found a bomb on an airplane or, you know, we've shut down the New York subway.
[03:08:28.517 --> 03:08:30.537]  But they're not invincible, Mr. Hoffman.
[03:08:30.577 --> 03:08:31.357]  No, they're not.
[03:08:31.417 --> 03:08:34.618]  And let me just add, we took the mechanism of government-sponsored terror.
[03:08:35.138 --> 03:08:40.299]  I saw that 12 years ago as their key nexus point, problem, reaction, solution, as many others inherently did.
[03:08:40.819 --> 03:08:50.041]  I've been exposing government-sponsored terror since 1997 in film, and I continue to try to take that mechanism and destroy it, break it.
[03:08:50.621 --> 03:08:59.790]  Have a renaissance, an awakening, an understanding, an enlightenment to problem-reaction-solution, whether it's fake water shortages or fake terror.
[03:09:01.111 --> 03:09:04.274]  And I also see fear as a healthy thing if it's based in reality.
[03:09:04.674 --> 03:09:05.956]  Why are you scared of a cliff?
[03:09:05.976 --> 03:09:11.921]  Because your body instinctively, that archetype of that cliff, is telling you this is danger, Will Robinson, step back.
[03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:20.103]  I mean, more in the fear, be afraid of not following God's law, God's commandments.
[03:09:20.743 --> 03:09:23.225]  That is fear of God, because if you don't, you'll be destroyed.
[03:09:23.245 --> 03:09:23.985]  You see the point I'm making?
[03:09:24.166 --> 03:09:24.386]  Yes.
[03:09:25.006 --> 03:09:41.117]  And the phase that we're in now, Alex, and I bring this out in my book, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, is the making manifest of all that is hidden, the revelation of the method, which I learned from my mentor, James Shelby Downard, who had studied the alchemical manuscripts and came across this term.
[03:09:41.618 --> 03:09:45.901]  It's very unusual, it's unprecedented in the history of the conspiracy
[03:09:46.569 --> 03:09:50.601]  And because what we have previous to this time is concealment.
[03:09:50.621 --> 03:09:51.063]  They always
[03:09:51.505 --> 03:10:20.825]  Tightly and closely guarded their top secrets and of course they continue to do so today I want to see if you agree with me They have to have revelation of the method because they believe the new age is here where they will exterminate 80 plus percent of the earth They have to have everyone ready to accept it the horrors that are coming They have to have us ready and so it's also a conditioning like you said a deadening to hear all this and then it is kind of Marvel at the beast as he did on the Isle of Patmos as they rush over you kind of
[03:10:21.705 --> 03:10:23.726]  Seeing it come on like a deer in the headlights.
[03:10:24.126 --> 03:10:30.849]  Yes, very important point raised in Arthur C. Clarke's novel, Childhood's End, where that point is brought out.
[03:10:31.330 --> 03:10:39.754]  The old cooking the frog idea of this process of gradualism and then accommodating us to a greater and greater evil.
[03:10:39.774 --> 03:10:45.576]  But see, the evil is just not exterior, it's also in us, it's in our interior.
[03:10:45.616 --> 03:10:48.778]  Well, let me ask you, why do you think they're now finally revealing everything?
[03:10:49.574 --> 03:10:51.255]  Because it's a form of mind control.
[03:10:51.956 --> 03:10:55.799]  Whenever anybody gets the truth, they're under obligation to do something with it.
[03:10:56.199 --> 03:10:57.600]  The truth is not a hobby.
[03:10:57.941 --> 03:10:59.762]  The truth, God didn't give us the truth.
[03:10:59.902 --> 03:11:01.343]  He hasn't set it out in front of us.
[03:11:02.704 --> 03:11:03.165]  You're right.
[03:11:03.245 --> 03:11:09.309]  If we don't do something about it, it is an acquiescence to it, and then we then become accomplices after the fact.
[03:11:10.290 --> 03:11:10.831]  Exactly.
[03:11:11.311 --> 03:11:13.753]  If I have time, very quickly, an example.
[03:11:14.213 --> 03:11:21.378]  If you went next door, and this is all hypothetical, I didn't even know you were married until I heard you refer to your wife.
[03:11:21.418 --> 03:11:39.109]  This is strictly hypothetical, but if you went next door to your neighbor's house, and they were showing home movies from their trip to Jamaica or Hawaii or whatever, and very briefly, out of the corner of your eye, for one second in the movie, it showed your wife in the embrace of your neighbor.
[03:11:39.665 --> 03:11:41.166]  And you know, you weren't sure that you saw it.
[03:11:41.206 --> 03:11:47.528]  Your neighbor's a great guy, your wife's a great woman, so you just sort of subliminally just push it out and say, oh, I must be tired or something.
[03:11:47.928 --> 03:11:54.091]  And then you watch the whole movie for another five minutes, and you see that image again, only it's not one second, it's two seconds.
[03:11:54.591 --> 03:11:56.172]  Now you're pretty sure you saw it.
[03:11:56.592 --> 03:11:58.132]  You ask your friend to run it back.
[03:11:58.272 --> 03:11:59.413]  It's not in there again.
[03:11:59.898 --> 03:12:07.689]  You go home, you start to investigate a little bit, you see evidence that, uh, again, this is hypothetical, that your wife was committing adultery.
[03:12:07.809 --> 03:12:09.811]  Okay, now you're under obligation.
[03:12:10.192 --> 03:12:12.255]  You have a truth that's been placed in front of you.
[03:12:12.714 --> 03:12:14.415]  Now, do you do something about it?
[03:12:14.956 --> 03:12:16.077]  Do you call her out on it?
[03:12:16.177 --> 03:12:20.681]  Or do you willfully double-think and crime-stop and decide to ignore it?
[03:12:21.061 --> 03:12:36.734]  Now you have to go along with her having orgies in front of you and denying it, which is why they show torture on TV, and why CBS on purpose showed lower levels of the torture, was to get people to then say, oh, it's no big deal, and now you've accepted the rape of children.
[03:12:37.034 --> 03:12:38.496]  Now you've gone straight to hell.
[03:12:39.056 --> 03:12:39.596]  Exactly.
[03:12:39.636 --> 03:12:40.857]  You've got it right there, Alex.
[03:12:40.957 --> 03:12:43.818]  Your journey towards the dark side is now complete.
[03:12:44.078 --> 03:12:54.182]  The movie Videodrome showed that people were going to be getting doses of sadomasochistic television and that those doses were going to create a change in their brain and in their mind.
[03:12:54.202 --> 03:12:55.863]  A movie done by David Cronenberg.
[03:12:56.443 --> 03:13:02.566]  I believe in the late 1980s and now it's come true in front of us because we are not acting.
[03:13:02.606 --> 03:13:05.567]  Now when people say, well Mr. Hoffman, what do you mean by act?
[03:13:05.587 --> 03:13:07.348]  Do you want us to go out and riot?
[03:13:07.608 --> 03:13:09.249]  Well, I can give you one example.
[03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:10.890]  Stop watching television!
[03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:12.070]  Don't let your children watch it!
[03:13:12.911 --> 03:13:13.491]  I've got a video.
[03:13:13.531 --> 03:13:16.652]  I can see the Longshoremen on the West Coast yesterday.
[03:13:16.672 --> 03:13:20.454]  The union there, not from the union heads, but from the grassroots.
[03:13:20.854 --> 03:13:24.236]  Stopped all loading of boats to protest the Iraq War.
[03:13:24.597 --> 03:13:34.183]  If we could have that across the United States... That's what they're worried about is spontaneous, and you know, this archetypal Sixth Sense thing works both ways.
[03:13:34.583 --> 03:13:39.046]  I think that, you know, we can say they're letting it, you know, we're letting them bring it out.
[03:13:39.086 --> 03:13:46.932]  I think a lot of the reason they're bringing it out now, and I think they rationalize, they're delusional too, they are letting a lot of this come out now because they can't stop it anyways.
[03:13:47.532 --> 03:13:50.473]  I mean, I think they knew the net would bring some of it out, but not this bad.
[03:13:50.493 --> 03:13:51.873]  I mean, now they're wanting to clamp down on it.
[03:13:52.193 --> 03:13:53.774]  I don't think they're God and all-powerful.
[03:13:53.794 --> 03:13:55.114]  I think they're going to get their butt kicked.
[03:13:55.474 --> 03:14:00.415]  Oh, certainly they want to control the information, and they reveal it in increments.
[03:14:00.955 --> 03:14:02.036]  Certainly they oppose me.
[03:14:02.096 --> 03:14:05.977]  There's a very heavy boycott on me, both on the left and the right.
[03:14:07.385 --> 03:14:09.967]  We get interference all the time financially.
[03:14:09.987 --> 03:14:12.729]  There's sabotage of our website.
[03:14:12.789 --> 03:14:17.373]  Every dirty trick in the book is being done to silence me, and probably you've had some of that treatment as well.
[03:14:17.393 --> 03:14:20.435]  Well, what you do is every time they attack you, you just start an extra website.
[03:14:20.455 --> 03:14:21.315]  You get like five, ten.
[03:14:21.335 --> 03:14:23.457]  They go, oh thank you, you attacked.
[03:14:23.817 --> 03:14:24.738]  I mean, that's my rule.
[03:14:24.978 --> 03:14:28.000]  I'm drawing a picture for the viewers out there, and you can pull these graphs up.
[03:14:28.020 --> 03:14:28.901]  They're all pretty similar.
[03:14:29.261 --> 03:14:31.223]  But basically, you get 1950.
[03:14:33.124 --> 03:14:34.906]  Okay, you've got the 40s, the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, and on.
[03:14:34.926 --> 03:14:38.891]  And as TV popularizes, as television gets into homes, you see an immediate spike.
[03:14:52.566 --> 03:14:54.166]  In fact, I guess they're not putting it on screen.
[03:14:56.167 --> 03:14:57.788]  Here's the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.
[03:14:57.968 --> 03:14:59.628]  You can go pull these graphs up.
[03:14:59.648 --> 03:15:06.170]  This is just a kind of a guesstimation or a... What's the term when you're not quoting someone exactly?
[03:15:06.190 --> 03:15:07.250]  Approximation.
[03:15:07.470 --> 03:15:11.571]  Yeah, an approximation or it's a... When you say... Well, I'm not quoting someone.
[03:15:11.591 --> 03:15:12.312]  Oh, you mean a paraphrase.
[03:15:12.392 --> 03:15:13.072]  A paraphrase, yeah.
[03:15:13.572 --> 03:15:17.053]  I mean, you can go pull the graphs up, but like the 40s, TV stars, late 40s.
[03:15:17.133 --> 03:15:18.713]  By early 1950s, it's very popular.
[03:15:20.894 --> 03:15:22.896]  And then you get almost total television watching by then.
[03:15:23.677 --> 03:15:27.441]  Then as they show violence on TV, it just skyrockets.
[03:15:27.841 --> 03:15:32.947]  Violence just absolutely skyrockets as they show violence on television.
[03:15:33.227 --> 03:15:39.153]  So you get television, and then as soon as you get television, violence just skyrockets as they show you the television.
[03:15:39.413 --> 03:15:40.474]  That's the Videodrome.
[03:15:40.514 --> 03:15:41.916]  That's what Cronenberg's saying.
[03:15:43.097 --> 03:15:46.279]  Well, that's right, and also we have to realize that it's happening on the Internet.
[03:15:46.319 --> 03:15:50.881]  I mean, the Internet is a great source of alternative information up to a point.
[03:15:50.981 --> 03:16:03.609]  I still encourage people to get a classical education and to read part of a book every day besides their regular Bible reading, but there's nothing like confronting a text in the quiet of your home for the contemplation, meditation, and
[03:16:04.525 --> 03:16:06.326]  The edification of your mind.
[03:16:06.346 --> 03:16:11.688]  I'm still a 19th century print reactionary when it comes to the utility of the printed word.
[03:16:12.148 --> 03:16:15.770]  I'm rereading Cooper's Last of the Mohicans.
[03:16:15.790 --> 03:16:17.630]  That's really hard to put down at 2am.
[03:16:17.730 --> 03:16:18.791]  Yeah, that's good.
[03:16:19.451 --> 03:16:26.074]  And so one of the things I want to warn people about the internet is if you've got any kids in the house, any teenagers, anybody younger than that,
[03:16:26.674 --> 03:16:36.338]  Uh, the pornography is free access, and if you don't have a super strong filter on there, and the software is available, and somebody said, well, what if my kid is a hacker and he hacks into it?
[03:16:36.358 --> 03:16:38.099]  Well, then I guess you'll have to get rid of the internet.
[03:16:38.119 --> 03:16:41.260]  Well, see, there's any rationalization to not even do basic controls.
[03:16:42.040 --> 03:16:48.343]  Well, I mean, I don't, I mean, I let my children play a few games on the computer, like drawing games and things, but I just don't let them on it unless I'm there.
[03:16:49.048 --> 03:16:53.713]  Right, because if you don't have the filter on there, they're going to lose their innocence in about 90 seconds.
[03:16:53.793 --> 03:16:55.755]  They can be 7, 8, 9, 10 years old.
[03:16:55.775 --> 03:16:58.297]  They're going to see the rawest, most hardcore pornography.
[03:16:58.337 --> 03:17:08.167]  And by the way, people think, you know, the devil's advertised as a hot woman in red with horns, you know, the neck of devil archetypal rockabilly image, and it's so much fun and cool.
[03:17:08.707 --> 03:17:13.870]  Really, as you lose your innocence, you lose the delicate perception of the walls of reality.
[03:17:13.890 --> 03:17:17.752]  And so innocence is actually more advanced.
[03:17:18.232 --> 03:17:23.374]  As you become more worldly, it's actually like your feelers have been seared and burned off.
[03:17:23.694 --> 03:17:29.937]  I mean, I feel like I've gone through hell and back, and lost a lot of my humanity just plumbing, you know, studying the New World Order.
[03:17:29.957 --> 03:17:30.818]  Do you see the point I'm making?
[03:17:31.178 --> 03:17:37.041]  Yes, it's a special apostolate, and you have to have a special grace from God to do it, because people like you and I who are
[03:17:37.521 --> 03:17:44.465]  involved in this area of study have to be very careful that we maintain our own mental equilibrium and our spiritual connection.
[03:17:44.485 --> 03:17:47.207]  I have to be honest, all the time I just feel myself becoming evil.
[03:17:47.627 --> 03:17:59.095]  But I think that it's important that your listeners know that there's a point where they've received all the information they need to have and they need to begin to organize as those longshoremen did.
[03:17:59.135 --> 03:18:01.236]  And you notice, Alex, how little media play
[03:18:02.123 --> 03:18:05.266]  That wonderful, spontaneous, grassroots protest out there.
[03:18:05.406 --> 03:18:06.007]  I didn't know!
[03:18:06.147 --> 03:18:06.687]  I didn't know!
[03:18:07.127 --> 03:18:08.088]  Yeah.
[03:18:08.429 --> 03:18:18.397]  But they don't want us to know, because the next thing you know, the Association of Retired Old Ladies will be taking their cars to the gas station, parking them, and walking away.
[03:18:18.457 --> 03:18:27.545]  I mean, that's the kind of message where Bush and these other Satanists, these skull-and-bones-ers, really thrive, is when we give them our consent through our silence.
[03:18:28.223 --> 03:18:31.605]  And again, it has to be a proper form of protest.
[03:18:32.126 --> 03:18:35.448]  It has to be something that is not carnal, but spiritual.
[03:18:58.403 --> 03:19:03.749]  Like, I know they did that, but just to see him, I mean, he is a literal pit demon incarnate.
[03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.891]  It's so obvious.
[03:19:04.911 --> 03:19:06.272]  How could people not see that?
[03:19:07.373 --> 03:19:07.854]  I agree.
[03:19:07.914 --> 03:19:19.186]  It seems obvious to me, but spiritual blindness is one of the first things that people get infected with when they have an insufficient love for the truth, and God is the one who sends it to them, the blindness.
[03:19:20.017 --> 03:19:23.742]  He hates it when we deliberately push away the truth and don't love it.
[03:19:24.202 --> 03:19:26.885]  And there's quite an obligation when you love the truth.
[03:19:27.406 --> 03:19:31.851]  Those who are truth lovers understand that you may not turn out to be the wealthiest or...
[03:19:32.563 --> 03:19:38.845]  The most popular person, but you're doing what God put you on this earth to do, and when you refuse that, then you get saddled with Bush.
[03:19:39.305 --> 03:19:44.627]  Bush is the president that we deserve based on the degenerated state of the American people today.
[03:19:45.187 --> 03:19:50.869]  The rehabilitation of this country starts with the spiritual renewal of each one of us, that each one of us pledges
[03:19:51.320 --> 03:19:54.342]  We will never steal anything again in our lives, not even a penny.
[03:19:54.643 --> 03:19:55.843]  We will never tell a lie.
[03:19:55.863 --> 03:20:01.948]  If somebody calls us up at home and we don't want to talk to them, we're going to have to tell our children, hey kids, tell them I can't talk right now.
[03:20:01.988 --> 03:20:03.769]  We're not even going to lie at that level.
[03:20:04.189 --> 03:20:11.475]  And when we build ourselves up from that to the longshoremen on the west coast that refuse to load those ships because they're tired,
[03:20:12.035 --> 03:20:15.799]  Of this murder and this genocide in the name of the American people on up.
[03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:30.295]  Then we've got a movement, but we have to move beyond simply infotainment and simply gathering all of this thrilling information because that can inculcate morbidity in us and that in itself is a form of passivity that the cryptocracy can use.
[03:20:31.633 --> 03:20:37.216]  I agree with you to a certain extent, for those that are doing nothing but getting into his infotainment.
[03:20:37.817 --> 03:20:43.560]  But I think most people, it's an explosive growth and awakening, and I have a more positive view overall.
[03:20:43.820 --> 03:20:46.622]  We need to take action with the knowledge we have.
[03:20:46.642 --> 03:20:47.482]  I think that's what you're saying.
[03:20:47.522 --> 03:20:47.702]  Yes.
[03:20:48.103 --> 03:20:48.723]  Okay.
[03:20:48.763 --> 03:20:50.764]  Listen, we've got to rampage through these calls quickly.
[03:20:50.784 --> 03:20:54.086]  We're going to talk right now to Eric in Philadelphia.
[03:20:54.787 --> 03:20:55.987]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:20:56.067 --> 03:20:56.828]  Eric, thanks for holding.
[03:20:58.885 --> 03:20:59.906]  Turn the phone up, it's always good.
[03:20:59.946 --> 03:21:00.586]  No, I have the phone up.
[03:21:00.767 --> 03:21:01.307]  How you doing?
[03:21:01.527 --> 03:21:02.028]  Good, go ahead.
[03:21:02.068 --> 03:21:06.111]  Yeah, you can go ahead and talk now, sir.
[03:21:06.131 --> 03:21:07.312]  Alright.
[03:21:08.113 --> 03:21:11.776]  I'm here to show you guys we're talking about the Luciferian effect.
[03:21:11.976 --> 03:21:13.157]  Now, your phone's really bad.
[03:21:13.177 --> 03:21:14.158]  I don't know why it's doing that.
[03:21:14.198 --> 03:21:15.219]  Just try to make your point quickly.
[03:21:15.239 --> 03:21:17.761]  Hold on, I'll fix it.
[03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:19.961]  Oh, he's on a voice changer.
[03:21:20.321 --> 03:21:22.443]  Oh, man.
[03:21:22.503 --> 03:21:24.285]  I'm gonna have to let you go.
[03:21:24.345 --> 03:21:25.066]  I'm sorry, sir.
[03:21:25.126 --> 03:21:25.866]  I just can't do it.
[03:21:26.207 --> 03:21:28.769]  I don't know if it's our phone system or what, but we'll find out here in a minute.
[03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:30.951]  You can call back and see if your line's better, sir.
[03:21:31.671 --> 03:21:32.312]  Who's up next?
[03:21:33.553 --> 03:21:34.454]  Josh in Florida.
[03:21:34.474 --> 03:21:34.994]  You're on the air.
[03:21:35.014 --> 03:21:36.736]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:21:37.236 --> 03:21:37.657]  It's us.
[03:21:38.037 --> 03:21:38.397]  It's us.
[03:21:38.898 --> 03:21:39.318]  Can you hear me?
[03:21:39.358 --> 03:21:40.820]  Go ahead and try now.
[03:21:41.783 --> 03:21:42.043]  Hello?
[03:21:42.603 --> 03:21:43.144]  I may have fixed it.
[03:21:43.164 --> 03:21:44.084]  I may have accidentally hit a button.
[03:21:44.324 --> 03:21:45.164]  The other guy can call back.
[03:21:45.184 --> 03:21:45.705]  Go ahead, Josh.
[03:21:45.725 --> 03:21:47.025]  Hey, how are you doing?
[03:21:47.125 --> 03:21:47.365]  Good.
[03:21:48.606 --> 03:21:49.266]  Great show today.
[03:21:50.266 --> 03:21:51.507]  Text Mars or Mr. Hoffman.
[03:21:52.267 --> 03:21:52.947]  Quick question.
[03:21:53.728 --> 03:22:06.393]  Mr. Hoffman, how do you feel about the correlation of the Book of Enoch, Genesis Chapter 5, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the story with Noah, and the Sumerian tablets?
[03:22:08.502 --> 03:22:18.870]  Well, there's an attempt, and I don't want to stigmatize it as necessarily New Age, but certainly out of the Da Vinci Code genre of books.
[03:22:19.370 --> 03:22:22.233]  To attack the credibility of the Bible and bring new texts.
[03:22:22.313 --> 03:22:25.375]  And also to associate it with the eternal pagan psychodrama.
[03:22:25.395 --> 03:22:31.580]  And if there's one thing the Old Testament is not, and what makes it unique is it stands apart and separate from that
[03:22:32.080 --> 03:22:32.881]  We're good to go.
[03:22:49.296 --> 03:22:55.879]  You can see parallels between Gilgamesh, you can see certain parallels because, for example, the deluge.
[03:22:55.979 --> 03:23:00.821]  The deluge exists in many cultures because they're witnesses to a fact that actually happened.
[03:23:01.181 --> 03:23:06.503]  But it doesn't mean that the Bible grows out of that type of paganism.
[03:23:07.123 --> 03:23:08.804]  I'm not an Old Testament scholar here.
[03:23:08.864 --> 03:23:12.946]  My specialty is Judaism, Talmud, Kabbalah, and secret societies.
[03:23:13.286 --> 03:23:16.068]  There are probably other people... Okay, let me get a comment from the caller.
[03:23:16.168 --> 03:23:18.629]  Yeah, we've got to move on or we'll be here all day.
[03:23:18.649 --> 03:23:20.850]  Does that answer your question, Josh?
[03:23:22.291 --> 03:23:28.034]  Yeah, and just the Adonai and the Nephilim and Genesis chapter 5, any comment on that would be great.
[03:23:28.355 --> 03:23:29.095]  I'll take that off there.
[03:23:29.878 --> 03:23:36.480]  Sure, the Nephilim is really what brought the flood down on us because of the practices that were going on.
[03:23:36.520 --> 03:23:40.000]  We're seeing a lot of these practices today, these bestial practices.
[03:23:40.921 --> 03:23:44.922]  The evolutionists say that we were apes and we're headed towards this higher state.
[03:23:45.062 --> 03:23:52.804]  I say that we began in a state of humanity and the cryptocracy is bestializing us down to the level... Well, let's be clear.
[03:23:53.024 --> 03:23:54.424]  Apes don't do what humans do.
[03:23:55.770 --> 03:24:06.838]  Yeah, we don't even, that's right, we've sunk beneath them, and so we can see parallels with the people, these depraved people in Genesis, we can see those parallels today in the modern world.
[03:24:06.878 --> 03:24:09.260]  Yeah, it looks like genetic engineering to me from what it says.
[03:24:09.280 --> 03:24:13.643]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Eric and Philly, you're on the air, sorry about the phone problem.
[03:24:14.364 --> 03:24:15.485]  Hey, not a problem, man.
[03:24:15.825 --> 03:24:18.207]  I think today's probably your best show, Alex.
[03:24:19.208 --> 03:24:20.108]  Okay, thank you, go ahead.
[03:24:20.949 --> 03:24:21.870]  Alright.
[03:24:22.549 --> 03:24:26.991]  Luciferians have been around for thousands of years, correct?
[03:24:28.292 --> 03:24:37.976]  Well, I wouldn't necessarily use the word Lucifer, but because that means light-bearer, and you can get him, but I would say that Satanists have been, yes, and they use the name Lucifer sometimes, yes.
[03:24:38.757 --> 03:24:47.081]  Well, Lucifer, I mean, like, you see a lot of, like, things have to do with light, like the Statue of Liberty's torch, and... Yeah, that's a man in drag.
[03:24:48.715 --> 03:24:49.416]  No, it really is.
[03:24:49.456 --> 03:24:50.477]  That French had meant that.
[03:24:51.238 --> 03:24:55.482]  You want to explain that to him, Mike, how it's a Masonic, garbed man?
[03:24:56.182 --> 03:24:59.966]  Well, I'm going to take his question and then we'll see what he has to say from there.
[03:24:59.986 --> 03:25:00.487]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:25:03.370 --> 03:25:03.870]  Alright.
[03:25:03.970 --> 03:25:08.995]  Also, you guys were talking about the Zionist disinfo that's going around.
[03:25:09.396 --> 03:25:09.576]  Yes.
[03:25:10.817 --> 03:25:11.458]  I had a guy
[03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:20.109]  Tell me that Dylan Avery is a Zionist Conspirator because he didn't have the dancing Israelis in his 9-11 movie.
[03:25:22.446 --> 03:25:24.127]  And that's the kind of stuff that goes around.
[03:25:24.147 --> 03:25:26.167]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's like an inquisitor.
[03:25:26.807 --> 03:25:28.208]  It's like they're the thought police.
[03:25:28.708 --> 03:25:31.569]  Everyone must say exactly and only on one subject.
[03:25:31.629 --> 03:25:34.629]  And my show's got to be 24 hours a day, only that.
[03:25:34.669 --> 03:25:36.670]  Now, this is a syndicated radio show.
[03:25:36.690 --> 03:25:37.890]  We're covering everything.
[03:25:38.831 --> 03:25:43.572]  But, yeah, Dylan Avery... By the way, I'm looking at Jason Burma's out the window.
[03:25:44.092 --> 03:25:48.213]  He's out there making a film that a large portion of it is about that right now.
[03:25:48.233 --> 03:25:50.554]  Why don't you ask him what he has to say about it?
[03:25:52.918 --> 03:26:10.731]  uh... well i mean i'm glad you know i'd really like that because like i said i like what he's out there and in the philip look i appreciate your call you see i'm here with michael dot on about as i said text mars on i had another guest on earlier this week talking about this i've always had guest on talking about this but but but once the sacrament
[03:26:11.451 --> 03:26:15.575]  That Alex Jones is bad and doesn't talk about these issues is set.
[03:26:16.176 --> 03:26:24.303]  People can't ever go back and say that they were wrong, that I'm not a Likudnik or something, okay?
[03:26:24.323 --> 03:26:28.487]  Yeah, it's part of the morbidity, Alex, of these people.
[03:26:28.607 --> 03:26:29.088]  Exactly!
[03:26:29.148 --> 03:26:31.490]  It's just dark hatred and cussing at people.
[03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:32.751]  Yeah, that's what I mean.
[03:26:32.791 --> 03:26:39.560]  They need to get out of their house, away from their computer, read a book, say some prayers, and get out into the real world.
[03:26:39.580 --> 03:26:48.051]  I know that I was part of a 9-11 session last summer, and of course I believe that the 9-11 attacks are a hoax.
[03:26:48.511 --> 03:27:01.441]  But I find that there are these inquisitors or people who have set themselves up as the pulps of the 9-11 conspiracy, and if I deviate 1% from their line of thought, then I'm as bad as Bush or King.
[03:27:01.481 --> 03:27:03.843]  Well, exactly, and then we all just factionalize.
[03:27:04.383 --> 03:27:07.586]  And my whole issue here is, you're a sharp guy, Michael Hoffman.
[03:27:07.987 --> 03:27:09.428]  You know, I didn't do any pre-interview with you.
[03:27:09.468 --> 03:27:10.630]  I didn't say what you could talk about.
[03:27:10.850 --> 03:27:12.011]  We take real phone calls.
[03:27:12.231 --> 03:27:15.795]  These guys go on the web and say my guests are fake, my calls are fake, it's all fake.
[03:27:16.376 --> 03:27:18.838]  But then they call into the show, and I'm not even mad at that guy.
[03:27:19.199 --> 03:27:20.700]  But here, hell, let's inquisit.
[03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:22.082]  I just won't get home to see my wife.
[03:27:22.302 --> 03:27:23.263]  Hey, come on in here, Burmish.
[03:27:23.283 --> 03:27:24.865]  You don't know what I'm talking about, but come on in here.
[03:27:25.425 --> 03:27:26.085]  Or maybe you are.
[03:27:26.105 --> 03:27:27.025]  You better not be listening to the show.
[03:27:27.045 --> 03:27:28.726]  You're supposed to be out there working and getting that film done.
[03:27:29.146 --> 03:27:31.787]  Okay, now you're making a film exposing the Israeli connection.
[03:27:32.127 --> 03:27:32.747]  A big part of it.
[03:27:32.807 --> 03:27:33.707]  Big risk to you.
[03:27:33.747 --> 03:27:34.667]  You know, big cojones.
[03:27:34.968 --> 03:27:35.908]  You're going to be demonized.
[03:27:36.028 --> 03:27:40.669]  You're the evil Zionist who has now been ordered to do this so you don't blow your cover.
[03:27:40.709 --> 03:27:41.449]  I mean, that's how it's going.
[03:27:41.469 --> 03:27:43.330]  See, we can't even then expose it.
[03:27:43.370 --> 03:27:43.990]  We have to be bad.
[03:27:44.290 --> 03:27:49.415]  I'm sure that's exactly how they're going to play it out, is that, oh my God, he is exposing it, but it's seven years later.
[03:27:49.655 --> 03:27:52.718]  Listen, I've talked about this on my radio show dozens of times.
[03:27:53.118 --> 03:27:54.119]  I talk about it in talks.
[03:27:54.139 --> 03:27:54.960]  What are you doing listening to the show?
[03:27:54.980 --> 03:27:55.880]  Out there, you're supposed to be working.
[03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:57.842]  I am working, but you just pointed at me, Alex.
[03:27:58.683 --> 03:28:00.464]  Oh, so you knew what I was saying when I just said it.
[03:28:00.504 --> 03:28:03.307]  Yeah, yeah, because the feed's going live out there, too, so we heard that.
[03:28:03.347 --> 03:28:05.429]  But yeah, basically, you know, I live with Dylan.
[03:28:05.469 --> 03:28:07.831]  I don't live with Dylan anymore, but I lived with Dylan for about two years.
[03:28:08.171 --> 03:28:10.213]  We're well aware of the Israeli involvement.
[03:28:10.333 --> 03:28:11.694]  Yeah, but see, this is a petty power trip.
[03:28:11.714 --> 03:28:15.536]  By answering the Inquisitor, then it's more inquisiting.
[03:28:16.456 --> 03:28:18.897]  And see, they have these people that just sit up there questioning.
[03:28:18.917 --> 03:28:19.978]  Like, I don't question everyone.
[03:28:20.178 --> 03:28:21.579]  Where are you from, Hoffman?
[03:28:21.739 --> 03:28:23.320]  Who's paying you to do this, Hoffman?
[03:28:23.500 --> 03:28:24.760]  Who's paying you, Burmese?
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.082]  I mean, I know that the globalists aren't all-powerful.
[03:28:27.362 --> 03:28:32.804]  They put out propaganda from big outlets, and then they have their minions regurgitated who don't even know they're part of the program.
[03:28:33.145 --> 03:28:34.545]  That's why their symbol's the pyramid.
[03:28:34.745 --> 03:28:35.806]  They're not all-powerful.
[03:28:35.986 --> 03:28:37.167]  They don't control everybody.
[03:28:37.947 --> 03:28:41.748]  And I tell folks, instead of thinking, I'm an agent all day, go out and wake somebody up.
[03:28:41.788 --> 03:28:42.488]  Go get involved.
[03:28:42.528 --> 03:28:43.288]  Go to a rally.
[03:28:43.549 --> 03:28:45.869]  Yeah, go figure out a boycott, like Mr. Hoffman said.
[03:28:46.349 --> 03:28:48.570]  But just submit to the guy, show him he has power.
[03:28:48.990 --> 03:28:50.930]  Why didn't you guys put the Israelis in there?
[03:28:50.970 --> 03:28:53.051]  Because it's a two-hour and nine-minute movie, Alex.
[03:28:53.071 --> 03:28:55.192]  We could barely put in the $100,000 wire transfer from the ISI.
[03:28:57.032 --> 03:29:10.741]  Well, also, let's be honest, it's an area we can't absolutely connect all the dots on, and the scum that says it's the Jews running it all is so horrible and virulent, attacking people that you don't want to be associated with them.
[03:29:11.181 --> 03:29:13.303]  I mean, Hoffman, are you getting the point we're making here?
[03:29:14.083 --> 03:29:24.710]  Well, sure, because I ran into it at that 9-11 meeting last summer, and it was a good one, run by Bruce Lichty, a California attorney, and a very fine man in my experience.
[03:29:25.276 --> 03:29:42.172]  And what I found was it was so absurd that there was a professor from the Berkeley area there, a very knowledgeable man, and he was talking about this heresy hunting that's going on inside the 9-11 movement, which, of course, there's a hidden hand behind it because it can destroy us with all the distrust and
[03:29:42.939 --> 03:29:44.801]  And uh, suspicion that's going on.
[03:29:45.121 --> 03:29:59.175]  But what I found was hilarious was one of the 9-11 activists would not come to the meeting because I was there, because he said that Hoffman doesn't believe that there were homicidal gas chambers in Auschwitz.
[03:29:59.764 --> 03:30:03.489]  So he's just beyond the pale and I can't meet with him.
[03:30:03.569 --> 03:30:12.020]  And I thought to myself, but people told me not to go to the meeting because there were 9-11 deniers there and they're beyond the pale.
[03:30:12.421 --> 03:30:14.464]  If we can't have goodwill for each other,
[03:30:14.944 --> 03:30:26.289]  If we can't have freedom of speech and freedom of inquiry and not automatically assume that the other guy is an agent or a spy or evil just because he descends from us, we're not going to make it.
[03:30:26.429 --> 03:30:30.530]  Yeah, that is the ether in which these people swim.
[03:30:30.570 --> 03:30:41.415]  Instead of that caller calling in and commending me for having the substantive courage to talk about these issues on air, which could also then restrict the number of people we can reach later to get the main message out, you have to weigh all that.
[03:30:41.775 --> 03:30:44.296]  Instead of saying, great job, it's no, you have covered up.
[03:30:45.837 --> 03:30:48.579]  And so now I'm like, God, these people are scum.
[03:30:49.620 --> 03:30:51.402]  Maybe they're completely wrong about things.
[03:30:52.382 --> 03:30:53.723]  But I guess that's really it.
[03:30:53.743 --> 03:30:55.425]  I mean, I guess I do have a classical education.
[03:30:55.445 --> 03:31:00.289]  Not that I'm smart, but I've seen how humans have worked before, and so I tend to know the patterns.
[03:31:00.329 --> 03:31:02.791]  And I don't think a lot of these people really have lived that much.
[03:31:02.851 --> 03:31:06.794]  I mean, maybe I'm not saying I'm different, but I just don't understand it.
[03:31:07.194 --> 03:31:09.496]  I mean, there's no discernment either.
[03:31:12.045 --> 03:31:15.348]  Well, a lot of these people are crippled in mind, body, and soul.
[03:31:17.149 --> 03:31:22.554]  They use this movement for whatever their own psychological hang-ups and problems are.
[03:31:22.574 --> 03:31:27.358]  You know, when you go to a left-wing meeting, when you meet with Norman Finkelstein and he's a
[03:31:28.254 --> 03:31:34.019]  An independent Judaic, and I disagree with some of his things, but I admire his courage greatly.
[03:31:34.079 --> 03:31:40.644]  And boy, when he talks about the Middle East or Palestine, he gave a speech recently at MIT in Massachusetts that I saw.
[03:31:40.664 --> 03:31:44.487]  A lot of the Arab people were there disagreed with him.
[03:31:44.627 --> 03:31:45.668]  It was all polite.
[03:31:45.708 --> 03:31:46.489]  It was courteous.
[03:31:46.889 --> 03:31:47.930]  He did a wonderful thing.
[03:31:47.970 --> 03:31:51.873]  He spoke for about an hour, and he said, you know, I'm going to take questions now.
[03:31:52.313 --> 03:31:54.495]  And since you all sat respectfully and heard me,
[03:31:56.196 --> 03:32:03.219]  I'm now going to give you the opportunity to ask me a question, and I want the first questions to go to those who disagree with me the strongest.
[03:32:03.599 --> 03:32:04.719]  Now, there was goodwill.
[03:32:04.839 --> 03:32:07.360]  He didn't fear his opposition the way rabbis do.
[03:32:08.280 --> 03:32:12.982]  He offered to his worst enemies in the audience an opportunity to go after him.
[03:32:13.622 --> 03:32:15.763]  And we don't see that largesse so much.
[03:32:15.783 --> 03:32:16.963]  By the way, I do that.
[03:32:17.144 --> 03:32:18.184]  I do that on my show.
[03:32:18.244 --> 03:32:19.905]  I see disagreeers go to the head of the line.
[03:32:20.185 --> 03:32:27.128]  But my whole point is, instead of it being about this process of fighting with each other, can't we just move on and have our topics be about info?
[03:32:27.428 --> 03:32:30.829]  See, I think half our movement, you're worried about morbidity and doing nothing.
[03:32:31.549 --> 03:32:39.733]  More of it is, it's not that so much as it is ninnying and fighting about who's got all the correct answers instead of doing core research.
[03:32:40.453 --> 03:32:49.276]  I mean, my gosh, if you listen to my show for a week, it's just so many views, ideas, but a general picture comes in at so many angles, and it increases your thought.
[03:32:49.656 --> 03:32:56.878]  That's why we make so much news, on the internet, is because we interview everybody, and that's what it's about.
[03:32:56.938 --> 03:32:58.819]  But you will never be forgiven, Burmese.
[03:32:58.879 --> 03:33:02.160]  I want everybody to know you're a scum, and you've been covering up.
[03:33:03.400 --> 03:33:07.442]  And how dare you make this film about Israeli involvement 9-11?
[03:33:07.502 --> 03:33:09.583]  You are filled!
[03:33:09.643 --> 03:33:12.125]  And you'll get attacked by the ADL and by the Aryan Nation.
[03:33:12.205 --> 03:33:19.769]  Absolutely, and I just want to let everybody out there, not only are we going to cover the dancing Israelis, we're going to cover the ones that were caught at the George Washington Bridge.
[03:33:20.129 --> 03:33:26.451]  We're going to cover Amdocs, we're going to cover Converse, we're going to show how this is part of an international spy ring.
[03:33:26.491 --> 03:33:35.934]  Sabel Edmonds, when she told her story to the Times Online, she discussed, hey, there were Turkish moles, there was Israeli moles, and there was a Pakistani operation going through too.
[03:33:36.395 --> 03:33:38.435]  And Mahmoud Ahmed was the one that headed that up.
[03:33:38.715 --> 03:33:40.976]  See, there's different operational arms in 9-11.
[03:33:40.996 --> 03:33:47.599]  You had the Israelis, who were more on the ground to, you know, tape the event, possibly let off some of the explosives.
[03:33:47.639 --> 03:33:48.939]  Then you had the Pakistanis,
[03:33:49.279 --> 03:33:51.241]  No, no, it's like we're saying three guys robbed the bank.
[03:33:51.261 --> 03:33:52.963]  They're all three just as guilty.
[03:33:53.003 --> 03:33:53.824]  And they're like, no!
[03:34:12.763 --> 03:34:19.426]  It's like when I say LBJ, because the admirals that were there and the captains and everybody, you know, they told me we believe LBJ was involved, it was all set up with Israel.
[03:34:19.666 --> 03:34:22.747]  That makes Israel more guilty and LBJ more guilty.
[03:34:22.767 --> 03:34:23.787]  It doesn't give them cover.
[03:34:24.107 --> 03:34:36.792]  You see, again, it's these people, that's why Christian religions break into thousands of pieces, because a new preacher wants to attack the old preacher to go set up his new group and make it about, it's jealousy of this radio show is the main thing.
[03:34:37.252 --> 03:34:37.773]  But hold on.
[03:34:37.973 --> 03:34:39.434]  We've spent enough time on this distraction.
[03:34:39.755 --> 03:34:43.978]  Now no one else gets to talk and talk to guests because that person called in with that.
[03:34:44.179 --> 03:34:45.460]  And then we have to defend this.
[03:34:45.700 --> 03:34:48.082]  But Burmiss, we're going to have you filling in next Friday when I'm out of town.
[03:34:48.342 --> 03:34:49.043]  Thanks for coming in with us.
[03:34:49.063 --> 03:34:49.764]  You're evil and bad.
[03:34:49.884 --> 03:34:50.384]  Thank you, sir.
[03:34:50.524 --> 03:34:50.785]  Thank you.
[03:34:50.805 --> 03:34:52.386]  Get out of here, you evil cover-up person.
[03:34:53.267 --> 03:34:53.687]  Take care.
[03:34:54.744 --> 03:34:59.186]  I just want to say, Alex, that they push the idea that knowledge is power.
[03:34:59.266 --> 03:35:01.948]  DARPA's slogan was scientia et potentia.
[03:35:02.508 --> 03:35:03.929]  I don't believe that knowledge is power.
[03:35:04.029 --> 03:35:07.370]  I believe that power lies in the ability to detect fraud.
[03:35:07.870 --> 03:35:12.973]  And that's something that you can really only learn through a lifetime of careful study, and you need teachers.
[03:35:13.653 --> 03:35:17.835]  It isn't simply a flood of knowledge and information, but it's the ability to detect fraud.
[03:35:18.196 --> 03:35:20.977]  Well, I mean, the people perish for lack of knowledge, though.
[03:35:21.755 --> 03:35:22.896]  Well, yes, that's true.
[03:35:22.916 --> 03:35:41.965]  That's one component of it, but I think there's a lot of folks that believe that knowledge itself is a palliative, and once you have this knowledge, but what happens is so many people have all these competing theories that folks expose themselves to an alternative, but if they don't have the ability to detect fraud, they end up more confused than even the regular man on the street.
[03:35:42.904 --> 03:35:47.107]  I'm not saying that you're wrong for having a program where you allow competing points of view.
[03:35:47.247 --> 03:35:55.274]  I think that that's excellent because, as I said, there's a boycott against our work, and you're one of the few that have afforded us a national platform, and I'm grateful for that.
[03:35:55.294 --> 03:36:00.578]  Yeah, but see, there's a boycott against you because you're actually being reasonable and trying to point at facts.
[03:36:00.658 --> 03:36:02.800]  That's what the establishment doesn't like.
[03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:04.201]  They want a bunch of idiots.
[03:36:06.402 --> 03:36:09.224]  Again, we've just never been afforded the credit that we've always covered this.
[03:36:10.145 --> 03:36:28.036]  It's just that we have it at a frothing, mindless, peon level, you know, way of doing things, and our job is to get people thinking, and to make no group feel bad, to make no group feel like we hate them, because we don't want to empower those groups by making them feel like they've been persecuted, because then they empower their corrupt masters.
[03:36:28.276 --> 03:36:29.076]  Precisely.
[03:36:29.096 --> 03:36:33.799]  And also, we want to do some counterintelligence where they come over to us.
[03:36:33.879 --> 03:36:34.660]  So many times
[03:36:35.320 --> 03:36:38.082]  We have had the cryptocracy infiltrate our ranks.
[03:36:38.503 --> 03:36:48.570]  How about us infiltrating their ranks by getting people of goodwill to understand we don't hate them, we want to lift burdens off their shoulders, and let's all work for the truth together.
[03:36:48.730 --> 03:36:49.971]  Okay, let's go to another call.
[03:36:50.632 --> 03:36:51.472]  Hear how I'm bad.
[03:36:51.492 --> 03:36:53.614]  And screen calls, even though they can call right in.
[03:36:54.695 --> 03:36:55.936]  Let's go to Will in Philly.
[03:36:55.976 --> 03:36:56.496]  I'm just joking.
[03:36:56.716 --> 03:36:57.257]  Go ahead, Will.
[03:36:59.145 --> 03:37:08.833]  For people out there not aware, make no mistake, there's a multi-million dollar campaign out there to balkanize the truth movement, and Alex, a large chunk of it's been on you, I'm sure you know this.
[03:37:09.013 --> 03:37:10.114]  Oh my god, it's incredible!
[03:37:11.115 --> 03:37:11.796]  It's unbelievable.
[03:37:12.396 --> 03:37:13.457]  I commend you, man.
[03:37:14.418 --> 03:37:24.547]  When you started getting nuts about the murder, the Mossad murder, torture of Riyad Hamed, I just knew, I said to my friend, I said, he's going to get death threats.
[03:37:26.022 --> 03:37:36.916]  If you continue to expose Zionism for the wretched ideology, and that's the operative word, it's not a religion, that it is, you're going to start feeling the heat, brother, and I just want you to take precautions.
[03:37:38.673 --> 03:37:45.815]  You can go online and you can see true Torah Jews against Zionism getting spat on by Zionist apologists and blind followers.
[03:37:46.375 --> 03:37:53.257]  And Herzl, Theodore Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, talked about how useful anti-Semitism could be.
[03:37:53.337 --> 03:37:58.238]  He said something to the effect that it is essential that the sufferings of Jews become worse.
[03:37:58.658 --> 03:37:59.798]  No, that's an exact quote.
[03:38:03.188 --> 03:38:08.553]  Well, see, I mean, that's like the ADL endorsing Schwarzenegger, who's a Nazi gay porn guy.
[03:38:08.673 --> 03:38:09.934]  Crazy Hitler.
[03:38:09.954 --> 03:38:13.798]  But that's okay, but then if you're for free speech, you're Hitler now.
[03:38:14.058 --> 03:38:17.241]  See, but our own movement's calling for speech control.
[03:38:17.601 --> 03:38:20.704]  Our own movement's calling for only having balkanization.
[03:38:20.744 --> 03:38:22.786]  See, no, I am for the Bill of Rights.
[03:38:22.906 --> 03:38:24.367]  I am for the Constitution.
[03:38:24.387 --> 03:38:25.068]  I appreciate your call.
[03:38:25.088 --> 03:38:26.790]  Great caller, but... Go ahead, Will.
[03:38:27.330 --> 03:38:29.311]  Anthony Hilder has a Catholic connection.
[03:38:29.391 --> 03:38:30.911]  I have his number if you want.
[03:38:30.931 --> 03:38:32.432]  You can put this Jesuit nonsense to bed.
[03:38:48.066 --> 03:38:50.827]  Well, no, I've had Anthony Hilder on many times.
[03:38:51.307 --> 03:38:52.467]  There's no putting it to bed.
[03:38:52.947 --> 03:39:01.969]  All these groups want to balkanize us and fight over who runs different heads of the Hydra, instead of just going, we've got an evil world government with a bunch of occultists running.
[03:39:01.989 --> 03:39:02.829]  And I appreciate your call.
[03:39:02.929 --> 03:39:03.609]  I've got to go.
[03:39:03.829 --> 03:39:05.029]  Listen, I've got to let you go.
[03:39:05.230 --> 03:39:06.350]  And I'll be called to censor for that.
[03:39:06.370 --> 03:39:07.730]  Probably not by him, but by somebody else.
[03:39:08.010 --> 03:39:08.810]  I've got to move on.
[03:39:09.270 --> 03:39:11.571]  We're almost past six hours here.
[03:39:12.531 --> 03:39:16.172]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Kyle in Connecticut.
[03:39:16.212 --> 03:39:16.892]  Kyle, go ahead.
[03:39:17.697 --> 03:39:21.299]  Hey Alex, thanks for stepping it up and going the extra mile.
[03:39:22.479 --> 03:39:28.522]  Um, I just have a question for, uh, I'm sick of these Reptoid, uh, Anunnaki, um,
[03:39:31.934 --> 03:39:33.715]  Nabooru people that are on your site.
[03:39:33.795 --> 03:39:35.756]  How do you deal with them?
[03:39:35.796 --> 03:39:37.316]  Well, I can't censor them.
[03:39:37.356 --> 03:39:42.959]  I only censor people that call for violence, and then report me for the violence they post on my comments.
[03:39:43.619 --> 03:39:53.943]  And we can make a registration tomorrow, but I tried to let people have First Amendment, and of course the moles come in, and then we kick people off who put links to porn, and they say we're censoring.
[03:39:54.784 --> 03:39:56.144]  Again, it shouldn't be about me, folks.
[03:39:56.164 --> 03:40:00.006]  This is the mental illness they've ingrained in us to only be able to talk about
[03:40:01.046 --> 03:40:05.830]  We're doing it right now, and then you try to fix it, but the more you talk about them, the worse it gets.
[03:40:05.850 --> 03:40:15.697]  You notice for two hours with Hoffman, I talked about issues, and now we go to calls, and we can see I'm not attacking you, but that's one reason my show's been successful, is I've always shut this stuff down.
[03:40:15.717 --> 03:40:20.460]  And I've even shut down defending me, because I don't care.
[03:40:21.001 --> 03:40:22.102]  Hoffman, you got any comments?
[03:40:23.042 --> 03:40:29.567]  Well, I wanted to mention our website, revisionisthistory.org, and I'm not quite
[03:40:30.337 --> 03:40:36.404]  I know you're talking about some kind of smog that hits your website and everything, and that's certainly endemic to our movement.
[03:40:37.164 --> 03:40:47.135]  The previous caller had mentioned the so-called Torah True Judaics, who have received a lot of flak for going over to Iran and participating in the revisionist conference.
[03:40:48.253 --> 03:40:59.702]  But you have to understand that these are traditional followers of the Talmud and the fact that they do these things does raise the prestige of the Talmud and it doesn't change the nature, the Babylonian nature of the Talmud.
[03:40:59.722 --> 03:41:05.246]  So we have to be aware and weigh in the balance whether this is a Trojan horse or not.
[03:41:05.507 --> 03:41:11.091]  Okay, let's go ahead now and talk to Todd in North Carolina.
[03:41:11.111 --> 03:41:11.811]  Todd, you're on the air.
[03:41:12.852 --> 03:41:15.774]  Hey Alex, I enjoyed the show today.
[03:41:15.794 --> 03:41:17.095]  I had a question.
[03:41:18.044 --> 03:41:22.225]  I've been following several different streams of information, including your show.
[03:41:23.325 --> 03:41:28.286]  One of the people out there, his name's Joel Rosenberg, I don't know if you've heard of him.
[03:41:29.206 --> 03:41:39.668]  He wrote a book called Epicenter, and he basically, he is a Russian Jew, who's a converted Jew, if that's what you want to call it.
[03:41:40.408 --> 03:41:45.650]  I work for Rush Limbaugh and Forbes Magazine.
[03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:47.510]  Okay, what's he saying?
[03:41:48.109 --> 03:42:00.436]  Well, basically, his book, Epicenter, it talks about Ezekiel 38 and 39, the war of Gog and Magog, and how Russia and Iran would have this alliance against Israel.
[03:42:00.737 --> 03:42:02.258]  Oh yeah, I think I've actually heard him.
[03:42:02.278 --> 03:42:11.343]  That's one of the guys I've heard on the show saying, we're about to have nuclear war, the Messiah is going to come, and he goes around all the Christian churches, just kidding him.
[03:42:11.383 --> 03:42:14.565]  Yeah, he's on Glenn Beck, and he's been on The Office and everything.
[03:42:14.765 --> 03:42:15.045]  I've heard it.
[03:42:15.065 --> 03:42:18.147]  Is that some sort of misdirection like you all were talking about?
[03:42:18.187 --> 03:42:19.348]  What do you mean misdirection?
[03:42:19.388 --> 03:42:26.433]  That's the takeover of the churches and making them believe they're going to make Jesus come by launching nuclear weapons.
[03:42:26.673 --> 03:42:41.683]  It's a cold-blooded, secular manipulation of the Christians that have been going off of the new Bibles they've printed in the last hundred years that preach all this made-up rapture stuff.
[03:42:41.723 --> 03:42:42.424]  I appreciate your call.
[03:42:42.744 --> 03:42:44.485]  Quickly on that subject, Mr. Hoffman.
[03:42:44.805 --> 03:42:52.671]  Yeah, if Rabbi Rush Limbaugh is behind it, and I'm half-kidding when I call him a rabbi, but he certainly behaves like one.
[03:42:53.071 --> 03:43:00.316]  If Rabbi Rush Limbaugh is behind it, you can be sure that when it comes to the Zionists or the Israelis, that this fellow is not a true Christian convert.
[03:43:00.676 --> 03:43:02.338]  And I think you summed it up in a nutshell.
[03:43:02.358 --> 03:43:07.141]  They're always trying to use the apocalypse or apocalyptic theories and pipe dreams.
[03:43:07.688 --> 03:43:18.735]  In order to identify some enemy of the Zionists as being God's enemy, and also calling the Zionist state Israel, when it's counterfeit Israel, is bankrupt right from the premise.
[03:43:20.476 --> 03:43:22.577]  Oh man, it's all going to end in nuclear war.
[03:43:22.638 --> 03:43:27.501]  Let's go ahead and dig in, and all the neocons will be happy, I guess, and all the liberals and everybody else, conservatives too.
[03:43:27.961 --> 03:43:28.881]  Carl in Oklahoma.
[03:43:28.901 --> 03:43:30.082]  We've got to end this soon, folks.
[03:43:30.122 --> 03:43:30.763]  I've got to get home.
[03:43:31.283 --> 03:43:31.943]  Go ahead, Carl.
[03:43:32.824 --> 03:43:34.185]  Hello, Alex and Michael.
[03:43:35.231 --> 03:43:37.132]  Please bear with me for a minute.
[03:43:37.312 --> 03:43:39.453]  I was born with six fingers on each hand.
[03:43:40.273 --> 03:43:42.294]  I'm the second child of my mother Bethel.
[03:43:43.154 --> 03:43:44.715]  I am Elijah the Antichrist.
[03:43:45.355 --> 03:43:46.496]  I appreciate your call, man.
[03:43:46.536 --> 03:43:47.216]  I can't do this.
[03:43:47.396 --> 03:43:48.036]  I can't do it.
[03:43:48.297 --> 03:43:49.097]  I can't do it anymore.
[03:43:50.054 --> 03:43:50.534]  I just can't.
[03:43:50.615 --> 03:43:52.256]  I mean, look, it's what they've done to everybody.
[03:43:52.276 --> 03:43:54.598]  We start taking the calls, and it's just insane asylum.
[03:43:55.378 --> 03:43:58.821]  But I still have you on, folks, because it's what you need, and all of you are great.
[03:44:00.322 --> 03:44:04.586]  There's a lot of delusions of grandeur across society, and I'm seeing it get worse.
[03:44:04.646 --> 03:44:06.467]  People kind of take on an imaginary mantle.
[03:44:06.748 --> 03:44:11.672]  It's like adults playing like they're three-year-olds with imaginary friends, and I just can't handle it.
[03:44:11.712 --> 03:44:12.172]  What about you?
[03:44:13.133 --> 03:44:17.617]  Yeah, I guess it's like the old joke about the insane asylum where the guy thinks he's Napoleon.
[03:44:18.672 --> 03:44:19.733]  Man, I'm seeing a lot of it.
[03:44:19.753 --> 03:44:20.934]  It's just insane.
[03:44:21.314 --> 03:44:21.795]  Oh, man.
[03:44:21.855 --> 03:44:22.355]  I'm sorry.
[03:44:22.876 --> 03:44:23.616]  Sorry I lied to you.
[03:44:24.437 --> 03:44:26.559]  And now he'll think, they know I am a secret one.
[03:44:26.679 --> 03:44:28.400]  Alex is of the Devil Goblin.
[03:44:28.881 --> 03:44:30.142]  I will get him or something.
[03:44:30.182 --> 03:44:33.324]  I mean, you know, it's just... David in Texas, go ahead.
[03:44:34.165 --> 03:44:34.766]  How are you all doing?
[03:44:34.806 --> 03:44:35.606]  Great show as usual.
[03:44:35.966 --> 03:44:40.309]  I thank you Alex for all your efforts in the Patriot Movement that you've been up to all these years.
[03:44:40.810 --> 03:44:41.930]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[03:45:04.025 --> 03:45:05.166]  No, no, I'm asking Mr. Hoffman.
[03:45:05.187 --> 03:45:06.288]  I want his take, then I'll go back to you.
[03:45:06.308 --> 03:45:12.115]  Well, Alex, to be candid with you, I didn't know much about you until you invited me on the program.
[03:45:12.195 --> 03:45:21.988]  I knew you had an important program because there were people who were telling me that he's very good on 9-11 and he's very good on this prison planet idea that what they're putting us through.
[03:45:22.028 --> 03:45:22.829]  Mainly, I'd heard that
[03:45:23.331 --> 03:45:28.776]  You had said that what they're putting us through at the airports, they intend to expand from those airports out onto the streets.
[03:45:28.796 --> 03:45:29.717]  Yeah, they're training us, yeah.
[03:45:29.757 --> 03:45:31.919]  Well, I mean, I'm not bragging, but I am kind of the big shot.
[03:45:32.440 --> 03:45:33.501]  But obviously not that big.
[03:45:33.521 --> 03:45:38.226]  You didn't know I was, but my point is, just analyzing me then as a guy, you know, right off the turnip truck.
[03:45:38.246 --> 03:45:38.826]  I'm off the turnip truck.
[03:45:38.846 --> 03:45:39.427]  What do you think of that?
[03:45:39.447 --> 03:45:43.651]  I just wanted to say that other people came on, maybe some of the flack that you get as well, and they told me,
[03:45:44.131 --> 03:45:45.673]  Oh, he's a Zionist poodle.
[03:45:46.074 --> 03:45:49.858]  He never covers the Zionist issue, and he'll never have you on.
[03:45:50.179 --> 03:45:57.388]  And even after I was on the first show, I got some emails along those lines, and my reply was, well, if he's the Zionist poodle...
[03:45:57.870 --> 03:46:01.993]  Why did he have me on the program and give me an opportunity to speak my mind?
[03:46:02.033 --> 03:46:03.674]  Now you've done that for a second time.
[03:46:04.054 --> 03:46:05.675]  Yeah, but see, that's how this works, though.
[03:46:05.735 --> 03:46:07.376]  I had guests on ten years ago about this.
[03:46:07.657 --> 03:46:11.559]  I mean, that's my point, is that it's too important that I be the bad man.
[03:46:11.579 --> 03:46:16.343]  I mean, if I see evidence to the contrary to something, I'll admit I was wrong.
[03:46:16.643 --> 03:46:17.864]  They won't do that.
[03:46:18.344 --> 03:46:24.008]  I'd like to ask my supporters to write letters to GCN Network and thank them for
[03:46:24.929 --> 03:46:36.559]  For having the Alex Jones program on the air, and I hope that the people who read my books and listen to my tapes will, uh, listen, uh, patronize your advertisers if it's something that they feel is good or useful for them.
[03:46:37.179 --> 03:46:52.812]  And, uh, I don't know, you know, I'd have to sit down and have a glass of beer with you to find out if we're on the same page on everything, but what I admire is the fact, and what I've gotten from you, and I'm sure you haven't tried to deceive me, if this is the real Alex Jones that I've been dealing with over these last two programs,
[03:46:53.206 --> 03:47:09.126]  You have a love of the First Amendment, you have a love of freedom of expression, and you have a love of people like me who are... I'm a very marginal person, and I have a small audience, and yet I think that some of the information and research that God has made accessible to me
[03:47:09.702 --> 03:47:12.165]  Is extraordinarily important for the survival of our nation.
[03:47:12.185 --> 03:47:12.966]  Well, no, exactly.
[03:47:13.026 --> 03:47:16.690]  That's why you're here, because I think the way you put it, I know you're genuine.
[03:47:16.750 --> 03:47:17.851]  I have discernment.
[03:47:18.732 --> 03:47:19.893]  I think a lot of people are blinded.
[03:47:19.913 --> 03:47:20.534]  They don't have it.
[03:47:20.954 --> 03:47:24.518]  And I've helped so many other people try to get their word out, and then they flip out.
[03:47:24.538 --> 03:47:26.380]  And I think they're in it for the wrong reasons.
[03:47:26.440 --> 03:47:27.482]  This is life and death.
[03:47:27.822 --> 03:47:28.783]  And again, it isn't that I don't...
[03:47:29.764 --> 03:47:30.645]  Well, so far, Mark, very quickly.
[03:47:47.759 --> 03:47:49.620]  The way I see it, first of all, I appreciate what you're doing.
[03:47:50.280 --> 03:47:52.260]  I generally agree with what you're doing and I certainly don't.
[03:47:52.541 --> 03:47:57.082]  If I had to do a couple of things, I'd take a slightly different opinion on it, but I don't hold anything against you.
[03:47:57.102 --> 03:48:03.224]  Well, I change some of my views, not my core views, not my core values, but I change views month to month, year to year.
[03:48:03.564 --> 03:48:09.746]  I mean, we all grow, we all change, we all have experiences, we all saw the Israelis run that
[03:48:09.966 --> 03:48:10.446]  I really gotta go.
[03:48:31.500 --> 03:48:32.281]  Oh, very quickly.
[03:48:32.841 --> 03:48:34.883]  I would say the movement, everyone needs to get together.
[03:48:34.963 --> 03:48:39.527]  It's the movement, it's about the country, our future, stopping world government conspiracy.
[03:48:39.567 --> 03:48:41.889]  But everybody get together though, it means everybody has to agree.
[03:48:41.929 --> 03:48:44.611]  It's not about a single person, it's not about egos getting out of hand.
[03:48:44.631 --> 03:48:49.155]  People need to be more humble and Christian anyways, and it's about God, not about any one of us individually.
[03:48:49.415 --> 03:48:52.658]  And I appreciate what you do, Alex, and I wouldn't be the kind of person I'd be.
[03:48:54.492 --> 03:49:00.895]  I don't want people to eclipse me.
[03:49:00.935 --> 03:49:01.776]  I appreciate your call.
[03:49:02.276 --> 03:49:08.440]  I have people that I try to trust do the show and fill in and build them up and then they do the most horrible stuff you can imagine years ago.
[03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:10.341]  I mean, you know, that's what I mean.
[03:49:10.661 --> 03:49:15.804]  I don't want to be the main attack frigate going in at point blank range against the New World Order.
[03:49:15.844 --> 03:49:18.946]  I don't like to, you know, give them every tool to come back and attack me.
[03:49:19.286 --> 03:49:22.649]  Well, if they're turning on you, then I'd have to say, where is the Christianity?
[03:49:22.709 --> 03:49:26.912]  Because Jesus said to love your enemies, to bless them that curse you.
[03:49:26.932 --> 03:49:31.335]  Oh, a lot of these people openly in the movement don't even profess to be Christian.
[03:49:32.656 --> 03:49:39.781]  Well, that's unfortunate then, because I think the Christians have to take the leadership, but they have to be authentic Christians and not Christians in name only.
[03:49:39.941 --> 03:49:42.283]  And I certainly want to testify that I
[03:49:42.836 --> 03:49:46.561]  I love the Talmudists, and I ask God to reform them.
[03:49:46.581 --> 03:49:48.023]  I certainly don't hate them.
[03:49:48.183 --> 03:49:51.908]  I hate the sins that are committed, and I hate the crimes that are committed.
[03:49:52.008 --> 03:49:56.154]  And as I said earlier, the Apostle Paul said, the ruler bears not the sword in vain.
[03:49:57.289 --> 03:50:00.812]  For example, I'm in favor of capital punishment, as the old-time Christians were.
[03:50:00.832 --> 03:50:02.414]  Well, I mean, that's a larger issue.
[03:50:02.574 --> 03:50:03.835]  I don't hate people in Israel.
[03:50:03.975 --> 03:50:04.956]  I don't want them to die.
[03:50:05.316 --> 03:50:08.719]  I know most of the people there are ignorant, don't even know what they're a part of, just like Americans aren't.
[03:50:09.019 --> 03:50:09.659]  That's my point.
[03:50:09.719 --> 03:50:15.424]  It's evil groups at the top, and so, just like if I'm attacking Italian mafia, I'm not against Italians.
[03:50:16.145 --> 03:50:26.353]  Right, but at the same time, the individual Israeli has got to be aware that they benefit from the colonialism and the oppression of the Arabs, and if you use the Allied World War II formula,
[03:50:26.946 --> 03:50:36.974]  That allowed the terrible Holocaust against the German people, the German civilians in all the major cities, and that's justified to this day by all number of ideologues on the right and the left.
[03:50:36.994 --> 03:50:41.498]  But you also have justification by the colonialism that happened here in the U.S.
[03:50:41.718 --> 03:50:43.159]  and we talked about that two hours ago.
[03:50:43.399 --> 03:50:43.619]  Yeah.
[03:50:43.859 --> 03:50:48.882]  No, I'm not for collective guilt, but they apply it to the Germans and then they exculpate the Israelis.
[03:50:49.002 --> 03:50:50.683]  Oh, I understand.
[03:50:50.723 --> 03:50:51.964]  That's why we're here discussing this.
[03:50:52.724 --> 03:50:54.065]  Uh, let's, uh, you know what?
[03:50:54.125 --> 03:50:55.005]  I just can't take anymore.
[03:50:55.045 --> 03:50:55.666]  We got to end this.
[03:50:55.746 --> 03:50:56.886]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:50:59.568 --> 03:51:00.528]  Ron in Ohio.
[03:51:00.768 --> 03:51:01.909]  I'm going to have to cut it off there.
[03:51:01.929 --> 03:51:02.389]  Go ahead.
[03:51:03.110 --> 03:51:05.551]  Hey, um, how you both doing?
[03:51:05.651 --> 03:51:07.352]  I appreciate listening to both of you.
[03:51:07.452 --> 03:51:09.433]  I've been following Mr, um,
[03:51:10.462 --> 03:51:13.947]  Uh, Hoffman's website for quite a while and reading up on it.
[03:51:14.308 --> 03:51:20.898]  I am a, uh, a, uh, a Christian, but I am what would be concerned a preterist.
[03:51:21.374 --> 03:51:26.236]  Which is demonized by most institutional sectarian churches.
[03:51:26.296 --> 03:51:39.842]  Well, I mean, if God's kingdoms come to earth and everybody's happy and there's no more evil in the world or the devil's gone, I mean, in the Christian paradigm, that just is crazy.
[03:51:40.223 --> 03:51:50.107]  I mean, I'm not mad at you, I'm not saying you're a bad person, I'm not saying you're going to hell, I don't get into these judging games, but the preterist thing has got to be even more ridiculous than the rapture crowd.
[03:51:50.587 --> 03:51:52.729]  It depends on who's preterist.
[03:51:52.789 --> 03:51:55.031]  Look, I've heard, I've studied the preterist stuff.
[03:51:55.291 --> 03:51:57.033]  I study all this stuff voraciously.
[03:51:57.273 --> 03:51:59.075]  Well, let's get Hoffman's comment on that.
[03:51:59.895 --> 03:52:07.722]  Well, I'm just concerned, basically, about this eschatology that suggests that all prophecy or majority of prophecy is unfulfilled.
[03:52:07.762 --> 03:52:08.723]  It happened in 70 A.D.
[03:52:08.763 --> 03:52:09.304]  by Titus.
[03:52:10.330 --> 03:52:25.790]  Well, I believe a great deal of prophecy was fulfilled in 70 A.D., but I believe there are also unfulfilled prophecies, but I think that it becomes a dead end for us if Christians who have good will, there's so few of us in this movement who are united on the big issues,
[03:52:26.249 --> 03:52:32.075]  And then we start tearing each other apart because one man is a praetorist and another man is something else.
[03:52:32.095 --> 03:52:35.438]  I mean, I'm not really privy to this theological minutiae here.
[03:52:35.959 --> 03:52:47.170]  I read the Bible and I don't really do this theological hair-splitting, which I think is almost a curse on Protestantism, with the factionalism and the subsects.
[03:52:47.822 --> 03:52:58.485]  And the disunity, it's certainly fine if somebody has a theory about prophecy, but I hope that it will not become something that interferes with salvation.
[03:52:58.625 --> 03:53:00.446]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[03:53:00.686 --> 03:53:02.466]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call, Ron.
[03:53:02.506 --> 03:53:03.406]  I mean, that's my thing.
[03:53:03.887 --> 03:53:12.009]  You know, I had family, the Ayers family and others, you know, that raised Colonel Travis's son, you know, it's in the movie The Alamo, him dropping his kids off.
[03:53:13.396 --> 03:53:14.516]  That's my mom's side of the family.
[03:53:14.536 --> 03:53:17.757]  I mean, my whole family, you know, involved in the Revolutionary War for this state.
[03:53:19.017 --> 03:53:19.937]  And on both sides.
[03:53:21.097 --> 03:53:23.818]  And Ayers came here.
[03:53:23.838 --> 03:53:26.638]  He was a Protestant activist in New York.
[03:53:27.159 --> 03:53:29.119]  He sold the land that the U.N.
[03:53:29.139 --> 03:53:29.779]  is on today.
[03:53:29.819 --> 03:53:30.619]  He was wealthy.
[03:53:30.979 --> 03:53:33.460]  Bought an entire ship full of Bibles, which was expensive.
[03:53:33.480 --> 03:53:34.080]  Most of his money.
[03:53:34.660 --> 03:53:35.700]  And he came into Texas.
[03:53:36.100 --> 03:53:37.921]  The Catholics were going to kill him in Galveston.
[03:53:40.601 --> 03:53:41.962]  And you know, the priest came after him.
[03:53:42.002 --> 03:53:43.083]  This is when Mexico ran it.
[03:53:43.443 --> 03:53:47.247]  Because he'd heard Protestants were being persecuted, he had to convert to Catholicism, at least on paper.
[03:53:47.667 --> 03:53:51.190]  In fact, on my dad's side, we have Mexican land grants that even say that.
[03:53:51.970 --> 03:53:53.332]  But, you know, nobody really followed it.
[03:53:53.352 --> 03:53:55.633]  You know, to get the grant, you just sign your name.
[03:53:56.574 --> 03:54:03.116]  And then they come to Nacogdoches, and then of course we're involved in the Revolutionary War here, starting all that.
[03:54:03.256 --> 03:54:06.897]  And I'm not Catholic, but I don't hate Catholics, individually.
[03:54:06.957 --> 03:54:09.497]  I mean, I think it's New World Order, obviously the Pope calls for it.
[03:54:09.697 --> 03:54:12.298]  But I don't want to get in a fight over that, so I say, yeah, the Pope's New World Order.
[03:54:12.598 --> 03:54:13.758]  Yeah, that's not what I'm into.
[03:54:13.778 --> 03:54:17.019]  Yeah, you know, my family, you can go check it.
[03:54:17.039 --> 03:54:19.760]  You know, the Hammonds, the Joneses, all of them Protestant.
[03:54:19.780 --> 03:54:20.920]  I mean, Texas is Protestant.
[03:54:21.520 --> 03:54:36.016]  And then they just say I'm a Vatican assassin, but the guy saying it says the Earth is on a string, floating, and the universe orbits it, and that flying saucers that Germans have have magnetic beams on Rosicrucian lines that zap people.
[03:54:36.236 --> 03:54:39.079]  And they're like, you will interview this great genius!
[03:54:39.299 --> 03:54:41.641]  And the person's a complete quack nut idiot!
[03:54:42.242 --> 03:54:43.943]  You know, and I will not be part of it!
[03:54:44.223 --> 03:54:57.611]  And I'm tired of these dumb inquisitors saying I'm a Catholic New World Order operative, which I have frankly found is a bunch of propaganda out of the Israel First crowd, and these idiots don't even know they're being handled by it!
[03:54:58.111 --> 03:55:08.677]  I think that so many people, Alex, who call themselves Christians or not, I mean, just the spirit you're describing of ill will and resentment, I mean, the true Christian has a gentle spirit,
[03:55:09.122 --> 03:55:10.803]  A spirit of reconciliation.
[03:55:10.823 --> 03:55:16.286]  A lot of people on the left who would call themselves atheists or who we might deride as liberals.
[03:55:16.807 --> 03:55:18.608]  I have seen kindness and gentleness.
[03:55:18.668 --> 03:55:21.650]  I was telling you about the reception that Finkelstein got at MIT.
[03:55:22.686 --> 03:55:27.128]  Everyone was courteous, but he was challenged in the questions, and it was just a wonderful exchange.
[03:55:27.788 --> 03:55:29.148]  No, I agree.
[03:55:29.188 --> 03:55:30.909]  Some of the liberals really are nice people.
[03:55:30.929 --> 03:55:33.650]  I mean, they've been manipulated and conned, but no, I agree.
[03:55:33.730 --> 03:55:40.312]  And their movement, you know, people get into the left because they hear that it's for love and brotherhood and helping people.
[03:55:40.672 --> 03:55:45.614]  A lot of people get into the right because they hear it's a way of preserving their coin collection and going to war.
[03:55:45.974 --> 03:55:51.376]  You know, we have to be careful because the right wing and the left wing are two wings of a predatory, kabbalistic bird.
[03:55:51.889 --> 03:56:02.235]  In Kabbalism, you have the pillar of mercy and the pillar of severity representing the right and the left, and it's a means of... Well, that's why they say it was Masonic with the two towers.
[03:56:02.875 --> 03:56:11.240]  In closing, all the numbers, the numerology, the 9-1-1, the number you get when you call the government, 9-1-1 in the occult, all of it.
[03:56:12.080 --> 03:56:16.502]  Yeah, we did a special issue of our Revisionist History newsletter on the occult aspects of 9-11.
[03:56:18.471 --> 03:56:26.802]  In fact, Tex Mars borrowed the image that we used there from the tarot card, and you've probably seen it in Texas literature, we were the first to use it.
[03:56:28.063 --> 03:56:36.174]  And that was of the flaming tower, with the people jumping off the tower, an exact recreation of an alchemical archetype.
[03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:45.779]  And I wouldn't be able to do justice to our research on that, but if folks go to our website, we have the online store with the revisionist issues there.
[03:56:45.799 --> 03:56:49.563]  So that murder was a massive ritual.
[03:56:49.583 --> 03:56:53.867]  I mean, it was done like that, and they do a lot of other killings like that.
[03:56:53.907 --> 03:56:56.149]  The year 2001 was predicted.
[03:56:56.289 --> 03:57:01.134]  Again, we're going back to Arthur C. Clarke, and it's kind of interesting how you and I have focused on that, because
[03:57:01.582 --> 03:57:05.645]  I mentioned it in passing, and you actually brought me back to it.
[03:57:05.725 --> 03:57:07.166]  Yeah, dawn of a new age!
[03:57:07.366 --> 03:57:09.147]  It's the start of evolution.
[03:57:09.468 --> 03:57:11.549]  Everything changes after 2001.
[03:57:11.849 --> 03:57:13.290]  Our lives will never be the same.
[03:57:13.551 --> 03:57:28.842]  Yeah, you may recall that on New Year's Day of 2001, the obelisk from the movie 2001, Space Odyssey, appeared in Seattle, and no one knew where it came from, and then it just mysteriously disappeared.
[03:57:30.323 --> 03:57:48.877]  Whether it was accidental, coincidental, synchronistic, it was certainly, from the point of view of symbolism, a very timely event to have that at the dawn of 2001, the 21 era, which both John Dee and Arthur C. Clocke forecast that 2001 was going to be a gateway into a completely different era.
[03:57:48.917 --> 03:57:51.919]  But as you mentioned earlier, Alex, and it's important to emphasize it,
[03:57:52.310 --> 03:57:54.311]  These people are not all powerful.
[03:57:54.612 --> 03:57:55.793]  They're very confident.
[03:57:55.833 --> 03:58:00.976]  They've been virtuoso in the execution of their conspiracy, because we ourselves have been weak.
[03:58:01.176 --> 03:58:02.277]  We have been faithless.
[03:58:02.577 --> 03:58:04.819]  We haven't done what God has wanted us to do.
[03:58:05.279 --> 03:58:12.985]  But if we ever do have the grace and fulfill the will and reason that God put us on this planet, then they can be defeated.
[03:58:13.285 --> 03:58:14.806]  It may not be a total defeat.
[03:58:15.205 --> 03:58:20.510]  But it can be a way of making this world a better place for our children, and that's what we need to do.
[03:58:20.910 --> 03:58:29.478]  And we've seen their fallibility in Vietnam, and we're seeing it in Iraq as well, where they stumbled in there and didn't even have a plan for the occupation.
[03:58:29.959 --> 03:58:33.322]  Feith and the other neocons were treating the Iraqis
[03:58:34.032 --> 03:58:37.855]  The members of the Ba'ath Party as if they were members of the Nazi Party.
[03:58:37.895 --> 03:58:42.138]  They were practically recreating the occupation orders that were created in 1945.
[03:58:43.139 --> 03:58:45.961]  Completely irrelevant to the situation in Iraq.
[03:58:46.321 --> 03:58:50.724]  You've got a lot of dumb people at the top and you also have some brilliant wizard types.
[03:58:51.265 --> 03:58:58.210]  But certainly God can conquer all of these if we will only allow him to use us as he wants us to be used.
[03:58:59.514 --> 03:59:01.935]  And I mean, not fight the New World Order because we hate them.
[03:59:02.715 --> 03:59:07.256]  Fight them because they're evil and they have to be defeated, and we have to protect the good people.
[03:59:07.856 --> 03:59:17.858]  And their minions, don't hate them because the globalists use our hatred of them to scare them under the dark bosom, under the black wings of the New World Order.
[03:59:18.219 --> 03:59:21.939]  Well, Michael Hoffman, thank you for spending time with us, and it's been an interesting discussion.
[03:59:21.959 --> 03:59:24.060]  I hope it stirs people to think.
[03:59:25.086 --> 03:59:34.249]  And to reflect on the different things that you've talked about, I know after five hours and ten minutes I am exhausted, so I'm out of here until this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:59:34.269 --> 03:59:40.531]  Central Standard Time, and we'll have you back up in the near future, and I appreciate your time and research.
[03:59:40.771 --> 03:59:42.672]  revisionisthistory.org.
[03:59:42.732 --> 03:59:43.332]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:59:43.492 --> 03:59:43.912]  Thank you.
[03:59:44.432 --> 03:59:46.053]  All right, folks, I am out of time.
[03:59:46.093 --> 03:59:48.494]  We'll hit the outro music.
[03:59:48.534 --> 03:59:50.335]  I've got a headache.
[03:59:50.555 --> 03:59:51.875]  I can't do more than four hours.
[03:59:51.975 --> 03:59:53.456]  I mean, it's just I had fun, though.
[03:59:53.816 --> 03:59:54.316]  Great guests.
[03:59:54.336 --> 03:59:55.677]  They got me in almost for three hours.
[03:59:56.597 --> 03:59:59.720]  And everybody out there, start waking somebody up.
[03:59:59.740 --> 04:00:00.660]  Start warning somebody.
[04:00:00.960 --> 04:00:02.201]  Stop taking their vaccines.
[04:00:02.281 --> 04:00:06.625]  It's like he said, boycotting them not unloading the ships.
[04:00:07.045 --> 04:00:07.986]  Don't take their vaccines.
[04:00:08.026 --> 04:00:09.147]  Don't drink their fluoride water.
[04:00:09.587 --> 04:00:10.127]  Take control.
[04:00:10.147 --> 04:00:13.190]  Stop using their cell phones that fry your brain.
[04:00:13.210 --> 04:00:14.551]  Stop living by cell phone towers.
[04:00:14.591 --> 04:00:16.012]  Take your kids out of public school.
[04:00:16.312 --> 04:00:17.913]  Start bad-mouthing the New World Order.
[04:00:18.313 --> 04:00:19.174]  Educate people.
[04:00:19.454 --> 04:00:20.315]  Stand up to them.
[04:00:20.675 --> 04:00:22.377]  And support those that tell the truth.
[04:00:22.597 --> 04:00:23.658]  Go get our books and videos.
[04:00:23.678 --> 04:00:24.398]  Get them out to people.
[04:00:24.738 --> 04:00:26.260]  InfoWars.com.
[04:00:26.620 --> 04:00:29.042]  God bless you all.
[04:00:29.603 --> 04:00:31.864]  Retransmission starts right now at InfoWars.com.
[04:00:31.884 --> 04:00:32.405]  Go to the stream.
[04:00:32.425 --> 04:00:33.566]  Had an incredible show today.
[04:00:33.946 --> 04:00:36.228]  InfoWars.com.
[04:00:36.608 --> 04:00:41.693]  Right now the streams will just meet the show where it was in retransmission.
[04:00:41.713 --> 04:00:41.973]  Take care.
[04:00:50.976 --> 04:00:51.257]  I think?
