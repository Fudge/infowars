[00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:07.435]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:09.136]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:10.997]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:12.419]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.080]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.423]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:22.987]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.137]  Later on the document, Cam, at PrisonPlanet.tv, I'll show you this headline, G20 Shaping a New World Order.
[00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:36.641]  CNN Money, that's meetings coming up this weekend.
[00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.402]  A lot of your phone calls.
[00:00:39.103 --> 00:00:42.966]  Jamie, Carl, Tony, Kyle, others, your calls are coming up.
[00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:44.628]  We'll have them for about the next 20-30 minutes.
[00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:49.472]  He's on a train, and he's Attorney Phil Berg.
[00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:51.053]  He was, of course, the Deputy Attorney General.
[00:00:52.248 --> 00:01:03.260]  of a major state as well, Pennsylvania, and he is the guy with Obamacrimes.com who tried to ferret out who his daddy really was, was he a U.S.
[00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:11.650]  citizen eligible to run for president, where was he really born, and they acted very suspicious and covered all of this up.
[00:01:12.648 --> 00:01:15.010]  And they also lie and say his dad wasn't a Muslim.
[00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.333]  Now, it's not an issue that his dad's a Muslim.
[00:01:17.613 --> 00:01:19.254]  It's that they lie about it when it's admitted.
[00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:21.196]  They lie and say he wasn't in Muslim schools.
[00:01:21.737 --> 00:01:23.098]  They lie about everything.
[00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:24.079]  Now, this guy's a puppet.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.945]  But he certainly couldn't pass, with what we know, a security clearance.
[00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:35.090]  So I wanted to get, but he's now the President, I wanted to get Phil Berg, who's a Democrat,
[00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:37.972]  My pleasure.
[00:01:38.092 --> 00:01:39.213]  I'm speaking to you from Washington, D.C.
[00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:39.333]  today.
[00:01:39.353 --> 00:01:43.776]  I had to come down here for some business to fulfill my desire for all Americans so that the U.S.
[00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:44.817]  Constitution is followed.
[00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.799]  I'm meeting with some people here who helped to
[00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:09.673]  I hope to, uh, help me in my endeavors to see that our Constitution is followed.
[00:02:09.993 --> 00:02:27.701]  Okay, uh, give us, uh, chronologically if you can, what happened right before the election, what happened at the Supreme Court, what happened with some of the other suits that others brought, why they're being so secretive with the birth certificate, claiming Social Security numbers can't be seen when Social Security numbers are not on birth certificates.
[00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:34.584]  Well, I think the reason that nothing has been produced is because I think I'm right on target.
[00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:44.384]  100 or 1000 percent that this is the biggest hoax ever attempted upon the American public in the history of our government.
[00:02:45.445 --> 00:02:49.028]  Barack Obama taught constitutional law.
[00:02:49.548 --> 00:02:50.409]  He's an attorney.
[00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.751]  When he was sworn into the U.S.
[00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:55.113]  Senate, he swore to uphold the Constitution.
[00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:56.714]  And what's he done?
[00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:01.337]  He can't produce documentation that he meets the qualifications for President.
[00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.159]  The qualifications are only three.
[00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:05.656]  One, you'd be 35 years of age.
[00:03:05.696 --> 00:03:06.097]  He is.
[00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:09.999]  The other, you've lived here in this country for 14 straight years.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.961]  And three, that you'd be a natural born citizen.
[00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:14.642]  He's not natural born.
[00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:17.884]  I can tell you right now that he was born in Kenya.
[00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:24.509]  But I can tell you, even if you buy the argument that he was born in Hawaii, he would have lost his citizenship.
[00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.331]  And people are probably saying, how can you lose your citizenship?
[00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:28.732]  But let's just back up for a minute.
[00:03:29.212 --> 00:03:30.753]  He was born in Kenya.
[00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:50.700]  And if your listeners have a, if the father and mother are both from the citizens of the United States, wherever the child is born, like you know, if your listeners go to Mexico or Jamaica or Japan or how about even Kenya, and while on vacation they have a child, as long as both parents are U.S.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.321]  citizens when they come back, that child is considered a natural born.
[00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:59.322]  But that's not the situation with Barack Obama, and he always, and he says, even though he called himself
[00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:04.114]  A mutt, when he's talking about the dog, and he said he's a mutt, he has a different background.
[00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:06.775]  His mother was a U.S.
[00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:08.275]  citizen, but his father was not.
[00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:11.797]  Well, in that situation, you have to look at the laws in effect at that time.
[00:04:12.437 --> 00:04:19.019]  The law back in August 4th, 1961, was the fact that if only one parent is a U.S.
[00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:23.181]  citizen, and the other parent is not, the U.S.
[00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.662]  citizen had to live in our country for ten straight years,
[00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:30.320]  Which he did, but five of those years had to be after the age of 14.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.221]  14 and 5 is 19.
[00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:35.783]  She delivered him when she was 18.
[00:04:35.883 --> 00:04:38.545]  So, according to law, he's not natural born.
[00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:41.547]  Now, some people are saying, well, that's only a technicality.
[00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:43.008]  Well, it's the law.
[00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:44.869]  The law is what the law is.
[00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.710]  You can't just say it's a technicality.
[00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.092]  So, on that basis, he's not natural born.
[00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:54.715]  Because if he's born in Kenya, and let's look at what's going on in Kenya right now.
[00:04:55.602 --> 00:04:56.602]  They're jumping up and down.
[00:04:56.642 --> 00:05:02.925]  They had a national holiday this past Monday, and I've heard that they're going to mark his birthplace as a National Lake Shrine.
[00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.566]  So, I mean, that's just more evidence that he was born there.
[00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:11.487]  And his grandmother is on video saying, I was there when he was born in the village.
[00:05:12.548 --> 00:05:17.029]  Well, one thing, let me say, the video is, we've checked the translation on the video.
[00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:18.170]  That is not accurate.
[00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.072]  But we do have on our website an audio taken about three weeks ago by a minister, which
[00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:35.817]  Yeah, it's in Swahili, but we have the translation also on our website, which is obamacrimes.com, where she says, I was in the hospital when Barack Obama was born here in Kenya.
[00:05:36.478 --> 00:05:43.400]  But the video, if you get someone to translate what they're saying in Swahili, it doesn't match what's on the English front.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.361]  I don't know who put that up.
[00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:47.042]  See, people are trying to turn it around and
[00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:51.969]  And try to make people like me be not considered suitable.
[00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:58.074]  Well, I mean, yeah, they're planting tar babies or honeypots.
[00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:03.677]  Now, the question I have for you is, where does it go from here?
[00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:11.403]  Okay, where we are right now is, the judge dismissed my case at the district court level.
[00:06:11.883 --> 00:06:15.126]  And what I did is I appealed it to the Third Circuit, but immediately to the U.S.
[00:06:15.146 --> 00:06:17.167]  Supreme Court because time's a-wasting.
[00:06:17.842 --> 00:06:21.805]  And the Supreme Court, I did file for an injunction to stay the presidential election.
[00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:30.372]  They didn't grant that, but I can understand that because there's a whole election process involving people from school board to commissioner all the way up to president.
[00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:31.894]  But the case is pending.
[00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:33.435]  My redissociatory is there.
[00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:40.100]  Barack Obama and the DNC and the other defendants have until December 1st to file a response.
[00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.902]  They don't have to, but that's it.
[00:06:42.382 --> 00:06:43.043]  After that date,
[00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:48.082]  And by that date, we're having a number of individuals around the country file what's called a front of the court brief.
[00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:52.183]  And September 1st, the court will decide whether to take the case or not.
[00:06:52.764 --> 00:07:03.327]  I'm hopeful, and I just spoke today to two law school deans, that they will take the case because, in effect, they're saying with that decision that no one has standing.
[00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:11.309]  That no one has standing to bring a suit against the Constitution, which is really ridiculous, especially on a constitutional requirement for presidents.
[00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:15.382]  If they take the case, then, depending on what their decision is.
[00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:24.209]  However, I have also filed another action, which is now under court seal, so I can't discuss it, but at the appropriate time, I will discuss it.
[00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:30.674]  It's a backdoor attempt to make him produce what he really is.
[00:07:30.994 --> 00:07:35.198]  Now, in addition to that, some people here, I'm in a meeting in Washington, D.C.
[00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:38.040]  Some attorneys here just filed a suit in California.
[00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:44.323]  Um, I think Mississippi, other, there's found lawsuits against the electors, or to tie up the electors.
[00:07:44.724 --> 00:07:48.545]  Um, Obama is not president, he's not even president-elect at this point.
[00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:57.289]  He got more votes, but the votes really don't mean anything under our system until December 15th, when the electors meet in every state throughout a great nation.
[00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:04.472]  And then, it really isn't final at that point, because then they send it to Congress, and it's the first or second week in Congress, Congress meets.
[00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:06.293]  If one, um,
[00:08:06.894 --> 00:08:07.134]  I don't know.
[00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:33.370]  And if he is, why hasn't he produced the records?
[00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:36.252]  It's very interesting that he hasn't produced any.
[00:08:36.372 --> 00:08:37.553]  We know nothing about him.
[00:08:37.613 --> 00:08:42.656]  Well, Phil Berg, speaking to that specifically, I mean, you're a Democrat.
[00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:44.137]  You're an NAACP guy.
[00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.517]  You didn't have an axe to grind here.
[00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:57.444]  You found out about this, as you told me a few weeks ago and a month ago, because you were researching it, because you'd seen the challenges on the Internet and didn't believe them, and then found that where there was smoke, that there was fire.
[00:08:57.484 --> 00:08:58.185]  But regardless,
[00:08:59.025 --> 00:09:00.226]  What did the Democratic Party do?
[00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:08.149]  I mean, they could have found lots of qualified black Americans who have been here for generation after generation, can prove their pedigree.
[00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:12.151]  I mean, when you're talking about a president, it doesn't need to be all clouded and questionable.
[00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:18.173]  I mean, much less a president whose father never even really lived here and wasn't a U.S.
[00:09:18.213 --> 00:09:19.794]  citizen and was a communist.
[00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:22.815]  I mean, that alone, and then all the weird Marxists and
[00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:33.064]  I mean, the establishment clearly can blackmail him with this now, and whether it's true or not, it's the covering up that's so suspicious, and they have been doing that.
[00:09:33.444 --> 00:09:45.654]  And the denial now by his followers, I see them even denying that he proposed a one million man civilian intelligence force and compulsory draft when it was on Change.gov.
[00:09:45.714 --> 00:09:48.477]  I mean, his followers are delusional.
[00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:56.539]  Right, I mean, what you're just referring to, they put on their website, and then there were so many complaints about it, they've changed it, now they're denying it.
[00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:57.040]  Add it.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.222]  I mean, you know, we need some... This is a candidate for change.
[00:10:00.442 --> 00:10:04.504]  We need some honesty in government, and I guess he fulfills that, though.
[00:10:04.544 --> 00:10:10.488]  He's a candidate for change because Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, had been talked to about running for governor.
[00:10:10.508 --> 00:10:11.168]  What did he say?
[00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:12.529]  He said, amend the Constitution.
[00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.992]  So I guess Barack Obama is a candidate for change because he says, I can walk on the Constitution.
[00:10:17.052 --> 00:10:18.273]  I don't need the Constitution.
[00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.438]  But you know what, we need the Constitution.
[00:10:20.478 --> 00:10:24.380]  Hey, they may start claiming that Schwarzenegger was born in the U.S.
[00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:29.643]  And then if you say he wasn't, they'll just say you're a conspiracy theorist, you know?
[00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:32.404]  Right, Schwarzenegger, what he should have done is just filed.
[00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:42.630]  According to the law proposed right now by Obama, Schwarzenegger should have just filed and said, you know, I'm natural born, you know, I'm not going to listen to you.
[00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.451]  That's what's absurd about this whole thing.
[00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:46.032]  So we're going to proceed against the electors.
[00:10:46.573 --> 00:10:48.475]  We're going to do everything in our power.
[00:10:49.876 --> 00:10:56.161]  Why didn't he just release it instead of a receipt for one that looks like it's fake?
[00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:57.242]  Many experts have looked at it.
[00:10:57.602 --> 00:10:57.962]  Why?
[00:10:58.102 --> 00:10:59.343]  Why not nip it in the bud?
[00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.966]  It's become an international issue.
[00:11:02.786 --> 00:11:04.007]  Because he wasn't born here.
[00:11:04.648 --> 00:11:06.069]  I mean, look, come on.
[00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:10.407]  If a lawyer, you know, let's take a criminal case, hypothetical case.
[00:11:11.008 --> 00:11:15.329]  Say my client committed this robbery, and he committed it, and I'm from Philadelphia.
[00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:21.212]  But that, on that particular day, he was in Washington, D.C., he was a guest of the White House, okay?
[00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:22.232]  Specialist.
[00:11:22.572 --> 00:11:28.135]  Well, wouldn't it produce evidence that he was in Washington, the White House, rather than have your client dragged through the mud?
[00:11:28.595 --> 00:11:33.637]  So, I mean, the thing here is, it's obvious that they don't have a birth certificate, because they wouldn't keep hanging their head.
[00:11:34.604 --> 00:11:40.107]  On the certification of live birth, which is a phony document, which they put up on their website in June of 2008.
[00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:41.888]  That's what's significant.
[00:11:41.928 --> 00:11:44.610]  That's before I ever got involved in this case.
[00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.031]  Before many people got involved.
[00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:47.532]  I mean, they haven't talked about it.
[00:11:47.552 --> 00:11:51.494]  They put this fraudulent document up to think people will buy it and go well.
[00:11:52.054 --> 00:11:56.777]  I think what's disgusting is the fact that I wish I could sue ABC, CBS, NBC.
[00:11:56.797 --> 00:11:57.617]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:11:57.697 --> 00:11:58.418]  One more segment.
[00:11:58.458 --> 00:11:59.738]  Phil Berg after the break.
[00:11:59.758 --> 00:12:00.439]  We'll be right back.
[00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:04.259]  All right, let me talk to Berg right now.
[00:12:05.503 --> 00:12:06.847]  And let's go ahead and kill the transmission.
[00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:07.810]  I want to talk to him privately.
[00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:09.698]  Stay there, stay there.
[00:12:09.718 --> 00:12:10.618]  One more segment.
[00:12:10.638 --> 00:12:11.679]  Phil Berg after the break.
[00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:12.599]  We'll be right back.
[00:12:34.895 --> 00:12:37.036]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:42.157]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with the reflective spray.
[00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:44.478]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[00:12:44.538 --> 00:12:45.698]  We are under the microscope.
[00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:49.720]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.281]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:56.702]  Have a fighting chance with SprayYourPlate.com's Photoblocker.
[00:12:56.802 --> 00:12:59.903]  When properly applied, this revolutionary product has proven itself
[00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:02.095]  We're good to go.
[00:13:30.755 --> 00:13:32.957]  And when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:36.840]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.742]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[00:13:40.042 --> 00:13:48.349]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:51.471]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[00:13:52.312 --> 00:13:55.535]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[00:13:56.876 --> 00:13:58.437]  How much are you willing to lose?
[00:13:58.837 --> 00:13:59.738]  Take action now.
[00:13:59.898 --> 00:14:04.360]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:08.463]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[00:14:08.683 --> 00:14:11.885]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[00:14:12.005 --> 00:14:18.469]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:20.590]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237.
[00:14:23.372 --> 00:14:40.520]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.841]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:44.562]  But who is the enemy?
[00:14:45.062 --> 00:14:45.582]  Bin Laden.
[00:14:45.842 --> 00:14:46.823]  This is his MO.
[00:14:46.843 --> 00:14:48.163]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:14:48.223 --> 00:14:49.684]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:14:50.205 --> 00:14:56.952]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:14:57.352 --> 00:14:57.793]  Some U.S.
[00:14:57.853 --> 00:15:03.599]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.644]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:15:07.884 --> 00:15:17.929]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:18.909]  Fabled enemies.
[00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:26.733]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:30.515]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[00:15:34.614 --> 00:15:35.075]  Attention!
[00:15:35.395 --> 00:15:38.077]  This is an extremely urgent self-reliant news bulletin.
[00:15:38.438 --> 00:15:44.903]  If you have ever wanted to produce your own cheaper-than-dirt survival food, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:15:45.544 --> 00:15:46.365]  Curious why?
[00:15:47.005 --> 00:15:56.234]  This network has just learned of a new video course that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare... www.foodshortageusa.com or toll free at 877-327-0365.
[00:15:56.254 --> 00:15:56.434]  Act now!
[00:16:06.943 --> 00:16:19.229]  Phil Berg, former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Democrat, NAACP head in his town, really got worried about this constitutional crisis.
[00:16:21.851 --> 00:16:24.352]  I mean, the guy's dad is a foreigner.
[00:16:24.392 --> 00:16:25.272]  He is a communist.
[00:16:25.312 --> 00:16:26.333]  He is a Muslim.
[00:16:26.613 --> 00:16:27.794]  He did go to Muslim schools.
[00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:30.495]  His real name isn't even Barack Obama.
[00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:32.516]  It's Barry.
[00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:38.390]  I mean, it goes on and on, and people are getting more and more upset about this.
[00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.711]  Phil, you were talking about the media slandering you.
[00:16:41.731 --> 00:16:42.411]  Please continue.
[00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:47.973]  Well, it's not that the mainstream media is just not covering it.
[00:16:47.993 --> 00:16:48.894]  They're not really doing it.
[00:16:48.914 --> 00:16:52.035]  Now there's some people on the internet who are, I think, jealous of me.
[00:16:52.075 --> 00:16:54.095]  They're putting all kinds of remarks up about me.
[00:16:54.575 --> 00:16:57.776]  I don't want to give their names to give them any credence, but we'll deal with those people.
[00:16:57.817 --> 00:17:02.138]  But there's people out there saying they're reporting me, and I did this wrong, I did that wrong.
[00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:03.710]  I have the case before the U.S.
[00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.230]  Supreme Court.
[00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.373]  I've raised the knowledge across this country of the question.
[00:17:07.873 --> 00:17:10.035]  I think, if nothing else, that's a major accomplishment.
[00:17:10.055 --> 00:17:12.016]  The other people are just trying to jump on the bandwagon.
[00:17:12.456 --> 00:17:16.699]  And whoever wants to jump on it, I don't care, because the bottom line is, we've got to find out the truth here.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.602]  And the truth is, in my opinion, is that he's not natural born.
[00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:22.143]  He has no business being President.
[00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:27.087]  And I think, really, hopefully, the criminal authorities will take a look at this after the fact, because I think people like
[00:17:27.574 --> 00:17:37.922]  Howard Dean, and other people at the DNC, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and his top campaign people, really are opening themselves up to very big criminal charges, because this is outrageous.
[00:17:39.243 --> 00:17:40.964]  Where do you go from here, Phil Berg?
[00:17:42.485 --> 00:17:43.866]  Well, like I said, we're waiting on the U.S.
[00:17:43.886 --> 00:17:44.507]  Supreme Court.
[00:17:44.547 --> 00:17:46.088]  We're getting some friendly court briefs.
[00:17:46.828 --> 00:17:52.513]  We'll be taking some action against the electors, because electors can only vote for a qualified candidate.
[00:17:53.013 --> 00:17:56.936]  And I filed some other case, which is now under seal, so I can't discuss it right now, but
[00:17:57.563 --> 00:18:00.466]  Um, in short time that will come out.
[00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:11.255]  We're just doing everything, we're going to put together a, uh, we have a flyer, uh, I'm sorry, a full page ad is out tomorrow in the, um, Washington Times, their weekend edition.
[00:18:11.935 --> 00:18:18.180]  And we're hoping to raise money to place ads in other papers across this country so that more and more people become aware of it.
[00:18:18.221 --> 00:18:22.504]  Because as people become aware of it, even Barack Obama people, they're saying, are you for real?
[00:18:23.165 --> 00:18:25.527]  And I'm saying yes, because they're starting to question.
[00:18:26.511 --> 00:18:31.013]  If he ends up getting inaugurated, we're going to have a constitutional crisis here.
[00:18:31.713 --> 00:18:35.054]  Because anything, any law, he'd be like usurping the power.
[00:18:35.635 --> 00:18:37.976]  And any law he signed into effect would not have effect.
[00:18:38.316 --> 00:18:42.017]  Any judge, any ambassador, anything he did would be illegal.
[00:18:42.257 --> 00:18:46.399]  Well, Phil, just on the face of this, I mean, again, I'd love to have a black president.
[00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:48.940]  I mean, I love how happy it's made, folks.
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.741]  People thinking there's not all this racism.
[00:18:51.621 --> 00:18:53.482]  You know, having all this weird guilt and the rest of it.
[00:18:53.822 --> 00:19:16.890]  But the fact is, it's a guy named Barack Hussein Obama, and I'm not somebody up here ever bashing foreigners or Muslims, but with all the fear-mongering about it, now suddenly this guy goes to communist schools, foreign schools, all these Marxist-Leninist... I mean, you couldn't write a book, a fiction novel, this weird, and then they're hiding, and the governor is hiding his
[00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.871]  His birth certificate.
[00:19:20.111 --> 00:19:21.631]  I mean, again, I keep repeating that.
[00:19:22.091 --> 00:19:31.475]  And then they lie and they call me a liar in the mainstream media and other places saying Obama never called for compulsory public service.
[00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:34.035]  I mean, his chief of staff wrote a book about it.
[00:19:34.856 --> 00:19:35.736]  He's talked about it.
[00:19:35.976 --> 00:19:37.016]  They posted it on his website.
[00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:39.557]  I mean, that's another example of the denial.
[00:19:39.597 --> 00:19:41.058]  They're saying that I now
[00:19:41.718 --> 00:19:44.981]  I'm a fabricator and a liar, and that that's not true.
[00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:47.943]  I mean, this is cult-like, Phil.
[00:19:49.224 --> 00:19:49.964]  No, it really is.
[00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:51.666]  I saw that on the website myself.
[00:19:51.726 --> 00:19:53.387]  So, you know, I don't get these people.
[00:19:53.447 --> 00:20:01.213]  And what you have to do to just protect yourself on this is, when you see things on the website, just download it, you know, put it someplace safe so we can have it here.
[00:20:01.253 --> 00:20:09.860]  Because if they're doing this this early, then I'd hate to see what they're going to attempt to do when they become, you know, if he becomes president.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.021]  And I hope that he doesn't.
[00:20:12.014 --> 00:20:13.174]  I want to do everything in our power.
[00:20:13.194 --> 00:20:14.295]  Well, that's what I wanted to say.
[00:20:14.435 --> 00:20:15.695]  Are you watching your back?
[00:20:17.596 --> 00:20:20.397]  I'm trying to.
[00:20:20.557 --> 00:20:21.517]  Have you had threats?
[00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:23.678]  No.
[00:20:25.499 --> 00:20:27.219]  I have not had any direct threats.
[00:20:27.639 --> 00:20:29.420]  I hope I'm talking about where I don't get any.
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.541]  I've just been telling people to be aware.
[00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:39.372]  I think if something happened to me, which I hope doesn't for my children and grandchildren, this would be a major front page story.
[00:20:39.432 --> 00:20:44.794]  So I think I have safety in the following because I'm so well known.
[00:20:44.814 --> 00:20:46.374]  Yeah, that's like Jim Garrison said.
[00:20:46.394 --> 00:20:47.634]  He's public, so he's safe.
[00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:49.255]  And I absolutely agree with you.
[00:20:49.575 --> 00:20:52.076]  Well, Obamacrimes.com, I know you're really busy.
[00:20:52.096 --> 00:20:56.077]  We're going to send a team up there to interview you for a Barack Obama piece I'm doing.
[00:20:56.737 --> 00:20:59.358]  Because, you know, I got blindsided by this guy.
[00:20:59.398 --> 00:21:04.438]  The way he lies, the way he said he'd end the war and not have illegal wiretapping, and then he backtracked.
[00:21:04.478 --> 00:21:07.359]  Now he's going to have lobbyists in the White House.
[00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:11.120]  I mean, this guy, this guy is making Bill Clinton look truthful.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.260]  That's interesting.
[00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.041]  You know, he says whatever he's supposed to.
[00:21:17.301 --> 00:21:23.282]  Look, the biggest example is, and I'm basically doing the constitutional, but Reverend Wright is the prime example of how he switched.
[00:21:23.722 --> 00:21:24.802]  We found out in April 2008
[00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:28.686]  That Reverend Wright made all these outlandish remarks.
[00:21:29.207 --> 00:21:30.508]  So what happens at that point?
[00:21:30.968 --> 00:21:38.574]  We found out that he prayed with him 20 months ago when he first announced his candidacy, but he wouldn't allow Reverend Wright up on the platform.
[00:21:38.654 --> 00:21:39.715]  Platformism, why not?
[00:21:40.205 --> 00:21:44.886]  Then that Friday night in April when he went on every cable TV show he could get on.
[00:21:45.066 --> 00:21:46.987]  Hold on, do five more minutes.
[00:21:47.487 --> 00:21:48.247]  We've got to go to break, Phil.
[00:21:48.287 --> 00:21:50.688]  In fact, I'm going to talk to you behind the scenes at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:50.708 --> 00:21:52.528]  Let me go and talk to Phil.
[00:21:54.048 --> 00:21:55.389]  Phil, I know you just got off a train.
[00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:56.429]  You're waiting to go do something.
[00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:57.889]  We're going to be out of break in three minutes.
[00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:59.890]  You want to come back and briefly finish up then?
[00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:01.309]  Sure.
[00:22:01.709 --> 00:22:02.509]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:07.291]  Now, we're on the internet with tens of thousands watching and listening, just not the AM and FM.
[00:22:08.191 --> 00:22:12.612]  Let's continue with that issue and then reiterate it when we come back, but please continue.
[00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:14.053]  Sure.
[00:22:15.573 --> 00:22:16.714]  I mean, we're still live right now.
[00:22:17.494 --> 00:22:18.194]  We're live now?
[00:22:18.234 --> 00:22:18.994]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:22:19.014 --> 00:22:20.035]  Yeah, just on the internet.
[00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:20.935]  Go ahead.
[00:22:21.595 --> 00:22:22.395]  Okay.
[00:22:22.736 --> 00:22:25.236]  Tell me where I was.
[00:22:25.296 --> 00:22:27.297]  We left off with Reverend Wright.
[00:22:28.672 --> 00:22:33.122]  Okay, Reverend Wright, on that Friday night, he went on every TV show he could to say what?
[00:22:33.162 --> 00:22:36.930]  To say, I was never in a pew when Reverend Wright made any of those remarks.
[00:22:37.535 --> 00:22:37.875]  Okay?
[00:22:38.115 --> 00:22:44.657]  But by Monday, when he went to Philadelphia, and he gave that famous race speech, which wasn't that famous.
[00:22:44.737 --> 00:22:46.658]  I mean, if you really read the speech, it wasn't that good.
[00:22:46.978 --> 00:22:51.139]  He has a delivery style, which is fabulous, when he's talking off the teleprompter.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.280]  But he slid into his speech there or something.
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.982]  When he was sliding into his speech, he said, I was in a pew when Reverend Wright made the remarks people were questioning.
[00:22:58.342 --> 00:23:02.323]  So between Friday night and Monday, he switched and slid in there.
[00:23:02.723 --> 00:23:05.244]  Most people probably didn't pick up that line in his speech.
[00:23:05.666 --> 00:23:14.729]  But it just shows he switches his thought process to go with whatever it appears that the people want to hear at that particular point.
[00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:17.690]  And that's not a true honest person that we want.
[00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.111]  Well, he's certainly a scary individual.
[00:23:22.171 --> 00:23:24.112]  I mean, I have never seen in U.S.
[00:23:24.132 --> 00:23:29.333]  history a case where they were calling people the one, the leader, the president of the world.
[00:23:29.994 --> 00:23:30.914]  Here's a headline right here.
[00:23:32.805 --> 00:23:33.385]  Here's one.
[00:23:33.885 --> 00:23:36.566]  It says, Barack Obama vows to change the world.
[00:23:37.026 --> 00:23:38.586]  That's for theprisonplanet.tv.
[00:23:39.547 --> 00:23:41.307]  Here, I'll give folks a document cam shot.
[00:23:41.607 --> 00:23:42.327]  Pull that up for me.
[00:23:44.288 --> 00:23:49.129]  For folks watching, again, at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:23:49.489 --> 00:23:53.970]  I mean, this is the type of headline that we've got literally by the hundreds.
[00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.071]  Barack Obama vows to change the world.
[00:23:57.871 --> 00:23:59.091]  Well, that's it.
[00:24:00.292 --> 00:24:02.152]  He wants to be the president of the world.
[00:24:02.679 --> 00:24:03.159]  But you know what?
[00:24:03.219 --> 00:24:04.640]  We need a president of the United States.
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.783]  We need someone to restore the dignity of this country, the honor of this country.
[00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:15.647]  You know, also, remember there's still that photo of him standing there not splitting the American flag because he and Michelle have trouble with the American flag.
[00:24:16.048 --> 00:24:20.711]  He wants to change our national anthem because he wants it more congenial for the Middle East.
[00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:23.492]  He doesn't like the word bombs bursting in there.
[00:24:23.933 --> 00:24:30.677]  I mean, if ever there's been a radical person who is trying to be president, it's Barack Obama.
[00:24:30.717 --> 00:24:32.158]  But the point is, really,
[00:24:32.951 --> 00:24:33.852]  He's not qualified.
[00:24:33.872 --> 00:24:35.773]  Point blank, he's not qualified.
[00:24:35.793 --> 00:24:36.894]  He's not natural born.
[00:24:37.495 --> 00:24:39.156]  And really, he should be arrested.
[00:24:39.336 --> 00:24:44.240]  I mean, I'm hoping that everyone out here... I'm hoping that the court system moves ahead.
[00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:48.479]  As fast as they can, so it's a decision before inauguration.
[00:25:17.176 --> 00:25:18.577]  And this song's for Jimmy Vaughn.
[00:25:19.377 --> 00:25:22.379]  Cause I know he loves Chuck Berry.
[00:25:22.439 --> 00:25:23.039]  Alright, Phil Byrd.
[00:25:39.929 --> 00:25:41.790]  Well, I think that what he has done here
[00:26:09.494 --> 00:26:21.278]  In cohorts with his wife, in cohorts with Howard Dean, an official of the Democratic National Committee, and his campaign staff, has attempted to pull off the biggest hoax in the history of our country.
[00:26:21.638 --> 00:26:23.179]  I mean, it's an outright fraud.
[00:26:23.379 --> 00:26:24.239]  I mean, think about it.
[00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:37.844]  He's not qualified to be president, and he's coming up with, the media should be, I wish we could sue the media, but I really think when it comes down to it, if he's not a natural born, and I'm sure he's not, because if he was, first off,
[00:26:38.439 --> 00:26:40.580]  If he wants to start saying, well, there's technical issues.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.400]  Well, they're more than technical issues.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:50.483]  And if he thought they were only technical issues, he should have then filed a lawsuit two years ago before he announced for president to clarify those issues.
[00:26:51.023 --> 00:26:52.164]  He hasn't.
[00:26:52.284 --> 00:26:54.464]  He refuses to divulge information.
[00:26:54.504 --> 00:27:05.628]  I think he hasn't released his college information because I believe, and I just spoke to a couple of deans of law schools today here, who confirmed it's probably on his application for law school or financial aid.
[00:27:06.232 --> 00:27:13.318]  Where he's a citizen of, and he probably put down he's a citizen of Kenya or Indonesia, and he probably applied for and received foreign aid.
[00:27:13.838 --> 00:27:16.520]  But, you know, we're asking for something called a birth certificate.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.143]  Every one of your listeners out there has to produce it.
[00:27:20.243 --> 00:27:26.788]  And many times, at least probably six times in a lifetime, you know, when they sign up for Little League, when they get baptized, when they get married.
[00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:31.532]  Some states for driver's license, for selective service, for passport, you know.
[00:27:32.281 --> 00:27:37.024]  There's many times you have to produce that document, and why won't he produce his, you know?
[00:27:37.524 --> 00:27:47.490]  It's not even a defensive issue at this point, because it's all over the internet, there's lawsuits pending all around this country, there's going to be more lawsuits pending because people are wondering, is he natural born?
[00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:56.375]  And if he's not natural born, he cannot be President of the United States, because it's one of the three basic requirements set forth in our Constitution.
[00:27:57.836 --> 00:28:27.405]  Alright, Phil Berg, I want to just, because you're the expert on this really, you know, you're out there vetting what's true and what's not, and you told me that it's not exactly that in Swahili, with his grandmother saying that he was born there, but now that there's another audio tape that is in Swahili where she does say it, what about what we're seeing on mainstream news sites, these supposed documents of him in Indonesia, where he lists himself as a Muslim and as a citizen of Indonesia?
[00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:36.334]  Yeah, I mean, his name on the document, which we have, I'm sure other people have, but it's on our website, it says his name is Barry Sotoro.
[00:28:37.595 --> 00:28:38.996]  Nationality, Indonesia.
[00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:46.061]  If he hasn't changed his name since then, legally changed his name, his name is Barry Sotoro.
[00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:47.782]  So that's another fraud in the American public.
[00:28:48.243 --> 00:28:56.629]  When he filed for the application to be admitted to the Chicago Bar, they put on there, they asked for his name and they put on there Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:28:56.769 --> 00:28:58.210]  They asked for other names and they said,
[00:28:58.775 --> 00:28:59.015]  None.
[00:28:59.596 --> 00:29:02.178]  So, I mean, he really has a lot of explaining to do.
[00:29:02.698 --> 00:29:12.406]  I mean, even Time Magazine, back when they were levied of him six months ago, said, you know, meet Barry, you know, when he was Barry.
[00:29:12.847 --> 00:29:15.088]  And so it was known that he went by that name.
[00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.872]  So, I mean, it's, the guy is a, who is he?
[00:29:19.952 --> 00:29:21.594]  And we don't even know, he's about to be president.
[00:29:22.918 --> 00:29:27.380]  That we have no idea who he is, because he won't release any documentation.
[00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:32.002]  And our mainstream media has refused to ask him any questions.
[00:29:32.483 --> 00:29:34.143]  I mean, look at Governor Pallin recently.
[00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:38.225]  She was totally vetted, you know, and they asked her everything under the sun.
[00:29:38.546 --> 00:29:39.846]  And if you can do that, that's fine.
[00:29:39.966 --> 00:29:40.566]  They're allowed to do it.
[00:29:40.647 --> 00:29:42.207]  But how come they didn't do it with Barack Obama?
[00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:48.991]  How come the media that travels with him, even today, how come the media that travels with him can't walk up to him and say, show us your birth certificate.
[00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:49.831]  Where were you born?
[00:29:50.478 --> 00:29:53.702]  You know, there are gutless media right now.
[00:29:54.162 --> 00:29:57.686]  It's controlled by a few corporations, and it's really a disgrace.
[00:29:58.287 --> 00:30:02.932]  And I'm thankful for people like you, who are willing to air this topic to the listeners out there.
[00:30:03.433 --> 00:30:05.875]  The more and more people who know about it are raising questions.
[00:30:06.036 --> 00:30:09.760]  Even people Democrats and people that have voted for him say, is this for real?
[00:30:10.529 --> 00:30:11.829]  Well then he can't be president.
[00:30:12.129 --> 00:30:13.090]  People want to know.
[00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.750]  People want to know who he really is.
[00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:18.751]  I tried to stay out of this.
[00:30:18.811 --> 00:30:19.811]  I'm non-partisan.
[00:30:20.191 --> 00:30:21.791]  I'm a 9-11 truther just like yourself.
[00:30:21.811 --> 00:30:22.951]  I mean, you've got a lot of courage.
[00:30:23.712 --> 00:30:30.173]  And I just tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, and then the guy has been a complete liar on every policy.
[00:30:30.593 --> 00:30:35.014]  I mean, he's literally 180ing on everything before he even gets into office, just throwing it in our face.
[00:30:36.114 --> 00:30:40.575]  The guy did go by the other name.
[00:30:40.995 --> 00:30:43.315]  Even the mainstream news, before it was an issue, said that.
[00:30:44.656 --> 00:30:51.897]  And my God, I mean, I guess he's really going to be the President and he's going to be an imposter.
[00:30:52.517 --> 00:30:57.518]  And then this just destroys the view... Not if I can help it.
[00:30:58.038 --> 00:31:01.279]  Not if I can help it and the citizens all across this great nation.
[00:31:01.755 --> 00:31:06.378]  We want to stand up and stand up for our Constitution and make sure that's what we need people doing.
[00:31:06.719 --> 00:31:10.842]  We need people right now to write to every member of the United States Supreme Court and say, hear this case.
[00:31:11.322 --> 00:31:13.003]  And it's ridiculous that I don't have standing.
[00:31:13.364 --> 00:31:18.968]  And also ask the Supreme Court, you know, to make him produce his documentation that he is a natural born citizen.
[00:31:19.448 --> 00:31:26.954]  And if not, you know, let the Supreme Court give instructions back to the lower court to demand that he produce these documents within a short time.
[00:31:26.994 --> 00:31:30.176]  And I'm talking he should be able to produce these documents within a week.
[00:31:31.017 --> 00:31:34.352]  And if he can't produce them, he should not be sworn in as President of the United States.
[00:31:35.694 --> 00:31:47.580]  Well, again, if I was born in this country and somebody was running around for month after month getting international attention and tens of millions of internet views of their website and their videos, I mean, I would release the birth certificate.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:52.803]  And again, the governor came out and said it has his private information for identity theft, his social security number.
[00:31:53.263 --> 00:31:54.604]  That is a lie on its face.
[00:31:54.984 --> 00:31:57.306]  Social security numbers are not on birth certificates.
[00:31:57.706 --> 00:32:01.508]  And back when he was born, you didn't get one until you were 16 or 15 and started working.
[00:32:02.068 --> 00:32:04.229]  I mean, that's when I got mine, when I was like 13.
[00:32:04.569 --> 00:32:08.250]  It is a lie, and again, everything they do is a lie!
[00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.632]  And then now they won't release it, and then his followers say, yes they have.
[00:32:12.772 --> 00:32:14.993]  No, that is a receipt.
[00:32:15.393 --> 00:32:16.453]  That is a receipt!
[00:32:16.874 --> 00:32:17.794]  Is it not, Phil?
[00:32:18.905 --> 00:32:21.886]  Well, it's actually called a certification of live birth.
[00:32:22.327 --> 00:32:24.668]  It's supposed to have the same information, although less.
[00:32:24.708 --> 00:32:27.529]  But our experts have showed that it is a phony.
[00:32:27.589 --> 00:32:28.189]  It's a fraud.
[00:32:28.249 --> 00:32:28.929]  It's been altered.
[00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.211]  And the thing is, even in the document in the upper right-hand corner, the number is blocked off.
[00:32:33.231 --> 00:32:34.532]  Why would you block that number off?
[00:32:35.592 --> 00:32:38.394]  That number would be a succession number of the document.
[00:32:38.454 --> 00:32:43.516]  And when you look at it up close, our experts determined that the name Maya is underneath M-A-Y-A.
[00:32:43.996 --> 00:32:44.436]  You know?
[00:32:45.217 --> 00:32:45.757]  So that's why...
[00:32:47.094 --> 00:32:49.015]  That's why it's a phony document.
[00:32:49.416 --> 00:32:51.797]  If he had his birth certificate, put up the birth certificate.
[00:32:51.837 --> 00:32:53.578]  And look at the website they posted it on.
[00:32:53.618 --> 00:32:57.701]  Is it true that Answers is tied into the Annenberg Foundation that bankrolls him?
[00:32:59.142 --> 00:33:06.927]  Factcheck.org has verified that it's true, but Factcheck.org is owned by Annenberg of Chicago, and that's where he sat on the board.
[00:33:07.328 --> 00:33:09.049]  Obama sat on the board there with Bill Ayers.
[00:33:09.758 --> 00:33:16.432]  So it's a little collusion perhaps for them to stand up and say that this certification of live birth is what it is.
[00:33:16.853 --> 00:33:18.276]  It really isn't.
[00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:34.476]  Well, they're trying to demoralize the country, and when all this comes out at will, and I just feel sorry for black folks, because when it comes out, just with his policies alone, this guy's total globalist trash, it's really going to make our first black president look really bad.
[00:33:34.777 --> 00:33:40.221]  Phil Berg, we'll talk to you soon, I've got my office calling you tomorrow, when you get back to Philadelphia, and I appreciate all your time, sir.
[00:33:41.322 --> 00:33:42.102]  Thank you, pleasure.
[00:33:42.362 --> 00:33:44.904]  Folks should support you at Obamacrimes.com, thank you.
[00:33:46.485 --> 00:33:48.227]  Alright, there goes Phil Berg, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:49.642 --> 00:33:51.544]  By the way, Paul Watson wrote a big article.
[00:33:52.665 --> 00:34:01.952]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com with what I ranted about back in the first hour of the show today.
[00:34:02.032 --> 00:34:05.815]  Kashkari accused of bailout bait-and-switch during angry hearing.
[00:34:06.836 --> 00:34:09.018]  Well, I mean, there's no accused of it.
[00:34:09.118 --> 00:34:12.901]  They say, we said we were going to do this with the money, now we're just keeping it for bonuses.
[00:34:14.342 --> 00:34:16.404]  It's up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[00:34:18.493 --> 00:34:36.743]  Paul Joseph Watson, Neil Kashkari, the fox appointed to guard the hen house and front the multi-trillion dollar bailout, faced angry questions from Dennis Kucinich, representative of Daryl ESA, during a hearing today, as ESA accused him of playing a bait-and-switch game with taxpayers' money.
[00:34:37.404 --> 00:34:42.707]  Now for some reason, Paul hasn't, I guess he's not up there yet, but Dennis Kucinich introducing him is what we need.
[00:34:43.959 --> 00:34:48.462]  I mean, Dennis Kucinich's first grilling, and just telling him to stop lying to him is pretty powerful.
[00:34:48.963 --> 00:35:04.234]  All the major networks, before I forget, because we've got a guest coming up in about 45 minutes, will you go grab the two clips that Watson does have up on PrisonPlanet.com, John, so I can play these before Dale Rundis joins us, and we will take your calls too, coming up in a minute, for those that are holding.
[00:35:04.674 --> 00:35:05.675]  But will you go grab those, Paul?
[00:35:06.175 --> 00:35:09.638]  I mean, will you go grab Paul's story, the video clips in it, John?
[00:35:10.638 --> 00:35:11.199]  Sure, I'll grab it.
[00:35:11.699 --> 00:35:11.979]  Thank you.
[00:35:15.192 --> 00:35:15.776]  It goes on.
[00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:20.200]  All the major networks carried footage of the U.S.
[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.322]  House Subcommittee hearing this morning and aired Kashkari's opening statement in full.
[00:35:24.842 --> 00:35:31.185]  But as soon as Kucinich and ESA were about to weigh in, the networks almost simultaneously cut the feed and moved on to a different story.
[00:35:31.465 --> 00:35:35.507]  Another example of how the corporate media is owned by the same elites that run the Federal Reserve.
[00:35:35.928 --> 00:35:45.072]  Kucinich accused Paulson and Bush of circumventing Congress by completely changing the destination of where the bailout money would go and refusing to disclose why
[00:35:46.684 --> 00:35:53.154]  They had taken, without disclosing where it went, and what had happened to the $2 trillion of taxpayer money.
[00:35:53.294 --> 00:36:01.026]  Adding, I think it's fairly obvious that Congress would have never passed the Rescue Plan had it known how Treasury would
[00:36:02.321 --> 00:36:04.163]  Marshall, the resources it was given.
[00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:06.085]  Again, it was not a rescue plan.
[00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:08.247]  The bankers orchestrated this.
[00:36:08.948 --> 00:36:11.311]  So of course they're not going to give it to the people.
[00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:13.073]  And again, I'm against giving it to the people.
[00:36:13.633 --> 00:36:24.285]  But if you're going to have socialism, and we're going to pay it back in tax money, and it's going to devalue our currency, it would help things compared to just giving it to offshore banks to give it to the public.
[00:36:26.886 --> 00:36:29.207]  I mean, it makes them dependent, it makes them make bad decisions.
[00:36:29.267 --> 00:36:31.708]  I mean, of course the bankers suckered you.
[00:36:31.768 --> 00:36:34.570]  Of course they got you in debt and pulled the economy out from under you.
[00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:40.433]  That's how they consolidate and set up the world government they're setting up this weekend, called the New World Order.
[00:36:41.873 --> 00:36:46.596]  Kucinich battled with Kashkari when as follows, according to Washington Blogspot Report.
[00:36:47.555 --> 00:36:50.538]  I assure you the Secretary is passionate about this, Kashkari said.
[00:36:50.578 --> 00:36:51.999]  Passionate about what, Kucinich said?
[00:36:52.459 --> 00:36:54.882]  About helping homeowners, Kashkari replied.
[00:36:55.062 --> 00:36:55.322]  Where?
[00:36:55.642 --> 00:36:57.103]  Kucinich asked, sarcastically.
[00:36:57.324 --> 00:36:57.924]  What country?
[00:36:58.425 --> 00:37:02.008]  We are using all the tools available to ease the credit crisis, Kashkari said.
[00:37:02.308 --> 00:37:04.370]  Let me give you an example.
[00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.533]  Kucinich interrupted Kashkari and continued his harangue.
[00:37:07.853 --> 00:37:12.417]  Well, because Kashkari had already five or six times with Kucinich refused to answer the question.
[00:37:12.737 --> 00:37:14.737]  And smiled at him like he'd just eaten a canary.
[00:37:15.037 --> 00:37:16.118]  The big Cheshire cat.
[00:37:16.438 --> 00:37:18.138]  The guy looks like the bad guy from The Mummy.
[00:37:19.138 --> 00:37:21.999]  Maybe this is a game to some people in the administration.
[00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:27.640]  They're on their way out of office and they can do whatever they want, said Kucinich, who tried to launch impeachment hearings against Bush.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.880]  Meanwhile, people are hoping against hope for help with their mortgages.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:36.861]  Gosh, Kerry tried to explain why the $700 billion, now $5 trillion, $2 trillion, they won't tell you where it went.
[00:37:37.282 --> 00:37:39.322]  And we're going to hear that $700 billion number forever, folks.
[00:37:40.578 --> 00:37:45.383]  Kashkari tried to explain why the $700 billion was not used to buy treble mortgages, but Kucinich would hear none of it.
[00:37:47.285 --> 00:37:56.253]  Shortly after, Representative Daryl Issa told Kashkari, you're here today because Congress is convinced you played a bait-and-switch and you're not doing anything to convince us otherwise.
[00:37:56.674 --> 00:37:58.756]  We don't need him to tell us they did a bait-and-switch.
[00:37:58.796 --> 00:38:00.718]  They did it on the record.
[00:38:01.638 --> 00:38:03.861]  But see, that's like a few months ago when oil
[00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:13.056]  You know, it was six months ago when oil was $150 a barrel, and it was $4 at the pump, and the dollar was plunging.
[00:38:15.558 --> 00:38:21.783]  Perino, the White House Press Secretary, had all the press conference people going, is it true the dollar's been devalued?
[00:38:21.803 --> 00:38:22.984]  Can the President tell us?
[00:38:23.565 --> 00:38:25.446]  As if they couldn't look at the currency indexes.
[00:38:25.886 --> 00:38:27.147]  And she said, I'm not allowed to answer that.
[00:38:27.167 --> 00:38:28.268]  I'd be fired if I told you.
[00:38:28.288 --> 00:38:32.632]  I mean, you're just showing a total breakdown at the White House.
[00:38:33.732 --> 00:38:34.512]  Because they run nothing.
[00:38:34.532 --> 00:38:34.993]  They're puppets.
[00:38:35.953 --> 00:38:36.894]  They're just a front.
[00:38:37.474 --> 00:38:40.536]  She sees out there kind of throwing a fit on TV saying, I'll be fired if I tell you.
[00:38:40.816 --> 00:38:43.017]  Like we need you to tell us it's a bait-and-switch?
[00:38:43.538 --> 00:38:48.620]  Like we need you to tell us that the dollar's been devalued?
[00:38:53.624 --> 00:38:54.024]  Amazing.
[00:38:54.324 --> 00:38:55.685]  Look, the article is very important.
[00:38:55.705 --> 00:38:56.886]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:56.926 --> 00:38:58.366]  Let's go viral with this right now.
[00:38:58.386 --> 00:39:03.769]  As more of the videos come online, we will find them and we will post them in the story for you.
[00:39:03.809 --> 00:39:04.749]  But it's important.
[00:39:04.789 --> 00:39:06.650]  This is a bait and switch.
[00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.011]  This is a mass crime.
[00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:13.273]  As Ron Paul said a month and a half ago here, they need to be criminally indicted for what they're doing.
[00:39:13.313 --> 00:39:18.056]  Kashkari, Paulson, Bernanke, they orchestrated the collapse.
[00:39:18.496 --> 00:39:21.357]  Now they are looting us and setting up world government.
[00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:22.478]  I mean, here's the New York Times.
[00:39:23.058 --> 00:39:25.239]  G20 Shaping New World Order.
[00:39:25.259 --> 00:39:27.361]  Give me a document cam shot.
[00:39:27.381 --> 00:39:31.983]  I want to show the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[00:39:33.524 --> 00:39:34.205]  I've got to be careful.
[00:39:34.225 --> 00:39:36.966]  I wrote Phil Bird's new cell phone number on this.
[00:39:37.847 --> 00:39:39.288]  So let me cover it up.
[00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:43.650]  There's the crazy office in here.
[00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:44.691]  There it is.
[00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:46.292]  I covered up my doodles and his
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.220]  Phone number here.
[00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:52.601]  Zoom in on that for you.
[00:39:53.262 --> 00:39:54.883]  G20 shaping a new world order.
[00:39:56.024 --> 00:39:56.844]  Saving you.
[00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:59.866]  You can Google new world order in Google News.
[00:39:59.906 --> 00:40:01.147]  There are 59,000 hits.
[00:40:01.887 --> 00:40:04.669]  And it's every newspaper you can imagine saying the banks are taking over.
[00:40:04.689 --> 00:40:05.810]  We'll pay taxes to them.
[00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:06.991]  That will save us.
[00:40:07.031 --> 00:40:08.092]  That will end the recession.
[00:40:08.332 --> 00:40:10.013]  These are the bastards that orchestrated it.
[00:40:12.662 --> 00:40:17.888]  And I know you as listeners of this show are fully aware of that, but the general public is not.
[00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:20.030]  So please, everyone, get this story.
[00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.093]  Kashkari accused of bailout bait-and-switch during angry hearing.
[00:40:23.974 --> 00:40:33.124]  And I want Paul just to add in here that the bankers are orchestrating this by design, and links to all the other great articles he's done, and links to the fact that they orchestrated the whole deal.
[00:40:35.003 --> 00:40:36.084]  But there it is.
[00:40:36.364 --> 00:40:39.345]  Kashkari accused of bailout bait-and-switch during angry hearing.
[00:40:39.626 --> 00:40:42.667]  Former Goldman Sachs executive grilled by Kucinich and Issa.
[00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:48.511]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls, those that have been patiently holding since we got Berg on.
[00:40:52.613 --> 00:40:53.493]  Okay.
[00:40:54.314 --> 00:40:55.335]  Who's up first here?
[00:40:55.355 --> 00:40:56.075]  There's too many.
[00:40:56.375 --> 00:40:57.015]  Jamie and PA?
[00:40:57.356 --> 00:40:58.536]  Jamie in Pennsylvania.
[00:40:58.556 --> 00:40:59.117]  You're on the air.
[00:40:59.137 --> 00:40:59.517]  Go ahead.
[00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:00.798]  Hello, Alex?
[00:41:01.078 --> 00:41:01.298]  Hi.
[00:41:02.338 --> 00:41:02.919]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:08.824]  I just want to make a comment about what these guys are doing in Congress.
[00:41:08.944 --> 00:41:09.865]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:41:10.326 --> 00:41:14.170]  I need to watch my language, and so do you, and I'm going to let you go because of that.
[00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.974]  I need to learn myself not to be like that, even though these things are very bad.
[00:41:18.694 --> 00:41:20.576]  But I have to ban people that use any of that.
[00:41:20.596 --> 00:41:21.697]  We have a lot of children listening.
[00:41:22.278 --> 00:41:24.681]  It's one thing to say smart A, but I shouldn't even do that.
[00:41:25.021 --> 00:41:25.902]  It encourages people.
[00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:28.665]  This is homeschooling curriculum a lot of places.
[00:41:29.066 --> 00:41:30.367]  We are not going to have that here.
[00:41:30.507 --> 00:41:31.448]  And you can be mad at me if you want.
[00:41:31.468 --> 00:41:34.231]  You can call back tomorrow, but no call today for doing that.
[00:41:34.271 --> 00:41:36.694]  Watch your language, folks, or I will cut you off.
[00:41:37.415 --> 00:41:37.695]  Okay?
[00:41:39.775 --> 00:41:41.716]  Carl in Montreal, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:41:42.096 --> 00:41:43.117]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[00:41:43.217 --> 00:41:43.557]  Good.
[00:41:43.837 --> 00:41:46.699]  I have an announcement to make, a short announcement.
[00:41:46.979 --> 00:41:54.644]  There's a 9-11 Truth event tonight at the University of Toronto at the Sidney Smith Hall, starting at 7pm to 9.30pm.
[00:41:55.144 --> 00:41:56.365]  There's going to be three speakers.
[00:41:56.505 --> 00:42:00.367]  One of them is going to be discussing Canada's role in the so-called War on Terror.
[00:42:00.688 --> 00:42:03.089]  There's going to be Mr. Zaremka from 9-11 Truth, Buffalo.
[00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:05.851]  He's going to be speaking there.
[00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:10.794]  I'm just trying to get the word out so people can go on the internet and look it up and get the word out.
[00:42:10.994 --> 00:42:13.936]  It's a free event, so I'm just trying to pass that word along.
[00:42:15.217 --> 00:42:15.737]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:42:16.378 --> 00:42:17.118]  Thanks for the plug.
[00:42:17.138 --> 00:42:17.738]  Appreciate it.
[00:42:18.219 --> 00:42:18.859]  Sounds good.
[00:42:18.879 --> 00:42:20.900]  Okay, we're going to go to break.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:30.106]  I'm going to come back and go to Tony in Canada, Kyle in Georgia, Lindsey in Idaho, Rick in Indiana, and many, many others.
[00:42:31.564 --> 00:42:51.227]  We got all these mainstream news articles admitting world governance, banking world governments being set up, world government, new world order, G20 to implement, global financial dictatorship, prisonplanet.com, they're going to charge you money to use cash, internet censorship openly being announced.
[00:42:51.287 --> 00:42:55.508]  I mean it is all so important and it's all coming up today.
[00:42:55.928 --> 00:43:00.269]  And we've got some of these clips from this hot hearing this morning coming up as well.
[00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:00.749]  Stay with me.
[00:43:02.077 --> 00:43:05.741]  Everyone knows that Omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:43:05.781 --> 00:43:08.083]  Let's keep rolling.
[00:43:09.324 --> 00:43:12.327]  No, no, I mean, we're gonna keep rolling here unless I say not to keep rolling.
[00:43:13.768 --> 00:43:15.050]  Talking to Hoog down here.
[00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:21.776]  I can keep track of all the people's names, all the nicknames in these offices and people in Minnesota and everywhere else.
[00:43:22.097 --> 00:43:22.537]  Hey, John?
[00:43:23.158 --> 00:43:23.398]  Yes, sir?
[00:43:25.947 --> 00:43:27.528]  That's a yes, Cobra Commander, to you.
[00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:31.651]  That's a joke, folks.
[00:43:32.011 --> 00:43:34.994]  We were joking the other day about Cobra Commander being the new president.
[00:43:38.276 --> 00:43:40.358]  You know, why should I have you download these clips?
[00:43:40.578 --> 00:43:42.119]  I can play them here and even stream the video.
[00:43:42.139 --> 00:43:48.444]  The problem is my line got cranked or something and it's been broadcasting in black and white with lines on it, but that's better than nothing.
[00:43:48.764 --> 00:43:50.125]  Why don't I just play these clips from here?
[00:43:50.925 --> 00:43:51.586]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:43:51.906 --> 00:43:53.928]  And then why don't you go YouTube search
[00:43:54.872 --> 00:43:57.273]  I'm almost done recording.
[00:43:57.293 --> 00:44:01.216]  I do have the first one, but I can go ahead and send you the links.
[00:44:19.707 --> 00:44:20.807]  Oh, so you do have the first one.
[00:44:21.127 --> 00:44:21.968]  I have the first one.
[00:44:22.008 --> 00:44:23.668]  I just have to transfer it over and whatever.
[00:44:23.708 --> 00:44:25.929]  But if you want to play the video, I can just send you the link.
[00:44:25.949 --> 00:44:32.290]  Let's do an audio test here with the first clip, because I'm always trying to play it from my... It's not quite ready.
[00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:32.951]  I just have to... No, no.
[00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:34.351]  I'm going to do an audio test with me playing it.
[00:44:34.391 --> 00:44:34.931]  Gotcha, gotcha.
[00:44:34.991 --> 00:44:35.851]  All right, here it is.
[00:44:35.891 --> 00:44:36.432]  ...the market.
[00:44:37.232 --> 00:44:41.613]  Then by definition, those assets, if bought at par, have appreciated.
[00:44:41.653 --> 00:44:42.213]  Isn't that true?
[00:44:43.173 --> 00:44:46.915]  Well, there are many... Again, with deep respect, Congressman... Is that too high?
[00:44:46.935 --> 00:44:48.555]  That sounds perfect.
[00:44:49.738 --> 00:44:50.318]  That's perfect.
[00:44:51.099 --> 00:44:52.880]  Man, the first clip's the powerful one.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.661]  I'll try to find that one.
[00:44:54.941 --> 00:44:55.981]  I bet I can find it.
[00:44:56.001 --> 00:44:58.102]  Alright, you look and I'll look, okay?
[00:44:58.442 --> 00:44:58.663]  Okay.
[00:44:58.923 --> 00:44:59.983]  And I'll just play this from my end.
[00:45:03.765 --> 00:45:04.405]  That's right, folks.
[00:45:04.445 --> 00:45:07.207]  Total Transparency here at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:45:07.727 --> 00:45:09.888]  Good to see us fumbling around behind the scenes.
[00:45:11.609 --> 00:45:12.249]  Mere mortals.
[00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:13.530]  Everybody's like, do this, do that.
[00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:17.132]  Folks, we're just trying to bring you a good radio show with key information to warn you about what's happening.
[00:45:19.793 --> 00:45:24.997]  If people want to give us some big, fat, giant donations or buy more of our products, we can hire more people and do an even better job.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:29.541]  Let me see.
[00:45:30.642 --> 00:45:31.642]  Dennis Kucinich.
[00:45:31.703 --> 00:45:34.585]  Dennis Kucinich.
[00:45:38.708 --> 00:45:39.889]  That's when you know you spell bad.
[00:45:39.929 --> 00:45:42.491]  When even the YouTube doesn't fix your spelling.
[00:45:42.972 --> 00:45:44.112]  How do you spell Dennis Kucinich?
[00:45:44.673 --> 00:45:45.534]  I got Dennis right.
[00:45:45.614 --> 00:45:45.874]  Dennis.
[00:45:45.894 --> 00:45:47.015]  How do you spell Kucinich?
[00:45:48.188 --> 00:45:48.468]  John?
[00:45:48.929 --> 00:45:56.194]  That's K-U-C-I-N-I-C-H.
[00:45:58.156 --> 00:45:58.777]  Well done.
[00:46:01.519 --> 00:46:02.219]  Okay.
[00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:06.763]  Let me find the today, the latest.
[00:46:10.346 --> 00:46:11.367]  Oh, I don't see it here.
[00:46:12.968 --> 00:46:15.310]  Drat, drat, double drat.
[00:46:18.851 --> 00:46:19.491]  I'll keep looking.
[00:46:20.031 --> 00:46:21.392]  Maybe I'll look under Kashkari.
[00:46:21.412 --> 00:46:22.932]  Well, how did Watson find these lighter clips?
[00:46:23.933 --> 00:46:25.153]  I bet it's under Alex Jones.
[00:46:25.193 --> 00:46:26.434]  I bet everything's under that.
[00:46:27.434 --> 00:46:31.896]  My name is like a... It just means anti-New World Order.
[00:46:31.916 --> 00:46:33.076]  It's kind of like a signpost.
[00:46:34.637 --> 00:46:38.618]  When the man comes around, hear the trumpets, hear the angels.
[00:46:39.338 --> 00:46:41.079]  La la la la la la la la.
[00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:43.640]  I can hear it in the background playing.
[00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:45.853]  People are like, what in the world?
[00:46:45.893 --> 00:46:47.494]  Jones is like singing to nothing out there.
[00:46:48.274 --> 00:46:52.014]  I can hear the music they're playing as I'm busy not going back to calls here.
[00:46:53.455 --> 00:46:54.295]  All right, whatever.
[00:46:54.955 --> 00:46:56.975]  Let's go ahead and go back to the full audience.
[00:46:56.995 --> 00:46:57.835]  All right, I sent you a link.
[00:46:57.975 --> 00:46:58.896]  Maybe that's the intro?
[00:46:58.916 --> 00:46:59.236]  I don't know.
[00:46:59.256 --> 00:46:59.696]  All right, here we go.
[00:46:59.716 --> 00:46:59.996]  Check it out.
[00:47:01.376 --> 00:47:02.676]  Man comes around.
[00:47:05.217 --> 00:47:07.497]  Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers.
[00:47:09.757 --> 00:47:12.238]  One hundred million angels singing.
[00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:22.625]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls here.
[00:47:37.586 --> 00:47:42.947]  Let's go ahead and speak with Tony!
[00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.428]  Who's up next?
[00:47:44.448 --> 00:47:45.428]  Is it Tony in Canada?
[00:47:46.508 --> 00:47:48.068]  Tony in Canada, you're on the air.
[00:47:48.969 --> 00:47:52.889]  Yeah, I gotta tell you Alex, I'm getting a little freaked out these days.
[00:47:53.269 --> 00:47:55.130]  Things are happening so fast.
[00:47:56.270 --> 00:48:04.712]  You recall about two years ago, you were talking about the plan was to basically destroy America's credibility.
[00:48:05.748 --> 00:48:13.097]  You know, he uses, point out the Americans as the bad boys, you know, going around blowing things up and everything else and destroying the economy.
[00:48:14.478 --> 00:48:25.912]  Well, doesn't it seem to you that in the pattern of events and the rate at which they're, you know, progressively increasing, that this is exactly what's being set up right now?
[00:48:27.546 --> 00:48:31.567]  Oh yeah, they stage 9-11 and then let it come out, but make it look like just the U.S.
[00:48:31.587 --> 00:48:32.287]  government did it.
[00:48:33.268 --> 00:48:35.868]  I mean, they're doing the same thing all over the world right now.
[00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:44.871]  And then they have all the world leaders and the Treasury Secretary come out and say, I said this two days ago, America is sorry that we're bad.
[00:48:44.951 --> 00:48:47.051]  We're sorry we caused this to the rest of the world.
[00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:51.773]  They go, that's okay, we'll set up a European banker-run world government to punish you.
[00:48:51.813 --> 00:48:55.654]  And they say, that's right, we're going to pay higher taxes because it's our fault.
[00:48:56.522 --> 00:49:14.276]  And then the world, out of their anti-Americanism that Bush was designed to create, and to bring to a head, they then, whoever says they're anti-American, they'll pile on with, and Europe will now go along with that, like, we'll show that George Bush, we'll pay carbon taxes on everything we do!
[00:49:14.296 --> 00:49:21.902]  I think they're setting up, you know, this thing with setting up the IMF and the World Bank, which would be a real nightmare.
[00:49:22.982 --> 00:49:28.025]  Um, and you know, a new world order, you know, as an alternative to when the U.S.
[00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.086]  system does collapse.
[00:49:29.106 --> 00:49:33.469]  I mean, people are going to be desperate for, you know, some sort of help, right?
[00:49:35.117 --> 00:49:35.978]  And they're going to give them help.
[00:49:36.058 --> 00:49:45.470]  I mean, that's Google New World Order today, and it says headline, you know, CNN headline, Germany, you know, oh, world government to save economy.
[00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.173]  Oh, my global governance, they will fix it.
[00:49:48.514 --> 00:49:51.317]  And it says, the global government will be the banks.
[00:49:51.598 --> 00:49:52.138]  Who did it?
[00:49:52.919 --> 00:49:56.320]  They openly do it, and then they openly say, voila, we're the king!
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.341]  If you don't like it, SWAT team, kill them!
[00:49:58.721 --> 00:49:59.822]  Oh, you don't like being a slave?
[00:49:59.842 --> 00:50:00.922]  SWAT team, kill!
[00:50:01.442 --> 00:50:02.903]  SWAT team, yeah, I'm tough!
[00:50:03.083 --> 00:50:05.164]  Yeah, yeah, kill them, evil Americans!
[00:50:05.844 --> 00:50:06.424]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:50:07.084 --> 00:50:08.125]  Here's my biggest fear.
[00:50:08.765 --> 00:50:11.046]  I don't think that Bush Cheney are finished with us yet.
[00:50:12.106 --> 00:50:17.568]  I have a really sinking feeling about November 26th, you know, that's it.
[00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:19.369]  Oh, you think one more little goody?
[00:50:19.969 --> 00:50:21.210]  Oh, I think that, you know,
[00:50:22.281 --> 00:50:25.102]  There's a few things lining up for an attack on Iran.
[00:50:25.683 --> 00:50:30.245]  Now, that might sound crazy, but you know that November 26th... Hey, they could do anything.
[00:50:30.285 --> 00:50:32.086]  They snuck attack Russia two months ago.
[00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:34.747]  These people are cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
[00:50:34.767 --> 00:50:35.147]  Stay there.
[00:50:35.647 --> 00:50:37.868]  Have you finished when we get back and more calls straight ahead.
[00:50:38.229 --> 00:50:40.070]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network.

[00:50:59.602 --> 00:51:02.684]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.

[00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.701]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:14.145 --> 00:52:15.586]  Alright, Tony and Canada.
[00:52:17.207 --> 00:52:20.229]  You'd think they might do a few more things as they leave office.
[00:52:20.629 --> 00:52:22.470]  That way it all gets blamed on Bush.
[00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:27.553]  And then the media's already saying that Barack Obama can't reverse anything George Bush has done.
[00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:31.255]  Just getting the public ready for that when it's total lie.
[00:52:31.835 --> 00:52:34.457]  But don't believe me, I have CNN reporting it two days ago.
[00:52:34.477 --> 00:52:36.218]  You can play it right now.
[00:52:36.238 --> 00:52:38.119]  I mean, just total bull.
[00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.311]  The former Fed Chief saying the Fed's above the law?
[00:52:45.031 --> 00:52:49.954]  I mean this is just criminals flaunting it in our faces.
[00:52:51.655 --> 00:52:58.758]  Let's go ahead and go back to Tony in Canada.
[00:52:58.778 --> 00:52:59.799]  Go ahead Tony.
[00:52:59.819 --> 00:53:00.199]  Hi Alex.
[00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.333]  Yeah, it's like these elites.
[00:53:10.573 --> 00:53:18.137]  I have the distinct impression it's kind of like, you know, the guys are looting the bank because they know it's going to collapse.
[00:53:18.738 --> 00:53:19.918]  The whole thing is coming down.
[00:53:19.938 --> 00:53:21.379]  It's been orchestrated.
[00:53:21.439 --> 00:53:22.080]  It's been planned.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.383]  I mean, I remember listening to you three or four years ago, thinking, you know, this guy's a little bit over the top.
[00:53:28.903 --> 00:53:31.485]  You know, I mean, you do tend to... Well, I am.
[00:53:31.765 --> 00:53:32.285]  No, no, no, no.
[00:53:32.365 --> 00:53:34.647]  I mean, I'm intellectually accurate, but then
[00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:40.023]  And my information is accurate, but no, I have gone crazy knowing the information.
[00:53:40.963 --> 00:53:47.207]  Well, you know, I don't blame you now, because, you know, everybody I talk to, I encourage them, I say, you've got to listen to this guy, because he's got it right.
[00:53:47.927 --> 00:53:53.730]  You know, as nasty as it is to hear the bad news, and it might ruin your day, you've got to know about this stuff, right?
[00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:58.173]  And I'm telling all your listeners out there that I think we're going to be lucky to make it through to Christmas.
[00:54:00.762 --> 00:54:06.045]  Well, what's scary is, I've never seen them act like this, Tony.
[00:54:06.085 --> 00:54:10.548]  I mean, I've never seen a government this wild, this criminal, this out in the open.
[00:54:10.568 --> 00:54:13.129]  I mean, not the Nazis, not the Soviets.
[00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:24.496]  I mean, this is, when you talk about financial criminal act, I mean, this is openly stealing money right in front of everybody and laughing at us.
[00:54:24.536 --> 00:54:26.237]  I mean, there's never been anything like it.
[00:54:26.257 --> 00:54:30.019]  And they're openly setting up world government run by the bankers that did it.
[00:54:33.823 --> 00:54:37.486]  Well, I don't know about you, Alex, but I rely a lot on my intuition.
[00:54:37.506 --> 00:54:46.273]  And I think when I was listening to you on the election night, when Obama got elected, you know, all day I was walking around with that real sinking feeling.
[00:54:46.893 --> 00:54:50.256]  I haven't felt that bad in a long time.
[00:54:50.276 --> 00:54:52.678]  It was kind of like, you know, okay, this is it.
[00:54:52.858 --> 00:54:53.479]  It's here.
[00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:56.163]  And again, it wasn't because it was a black guy.
[00:54:56.483 --> 00:55:04.547]  It was watching the zombies, the slickness, the slickness of the speech, like a Hollywood movie with epic music playing when he had his victory speech.
[00:55:04.667 --> 00:55:07.068]  It all was staged, and exactly.
[00:55:07.168 --> 00:55:13.651]  I've never... I've had this feeling of dread now for about six months, but it intensified that night, and now it's just resolved to fight it.
[00:55:13.691 --> 00:55:14.591]  But yeah, dread.
[00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:15.552]  Dread.
[00:55:15.692 --> 00:55:16.832]  I am dreading what's happening.
[00:55:16.852 --> 00:55:17.593]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:17.633 --> 00:55:18.033]  Good points.
[00:55:18.793 --> 00:55:20.154]  Let's talk to Rick in Indiana.
[00:55:20.234 --> 00:55:20.894]  Rick, you're on the air.
[00:55:24.071 --> 00:55:42.241]  Listen, man, I want to tell you, I went to Barack Obama's speech in South Bend, Indiana, when he came to Washington High School, and the very first thing he did, the very first thing he did, was he congratulated Tim Romer for all the hard work that he did on the 9-11 Commission.
[00:55:43.682 --> 00:55:45.603]  That was the very first thing that he did.
[00:55:46.323 --> 00:55:46.883]  Right then and there.
[00:55:46.923 --> 00:55:49.424]  And I went there not to support him, I went there just to hear what he had to say.
[00:55:49.445 --> 00:55:51.826]  I wanted to hear what this guy had to say, I wanted to hear him speak, I wanted to see
[00:55:53.107 --> 00:55:55.949]  I was like, I want to see what the big rush was about.
[00:55:55.989 --> 00:56:02.694]  Oh, they're saying we're going to be tested, and they're going to blow a bunch of stuff up, and he's going to grandstand, and all the conservatives are going to love him, and then they're going to start arresting people.
[00:56:02.754 --> 00:56:03.074]  Go ahead.
[00:56:03.375 --> 00:56:06.257]  Well, and one of the other things, when you had the colonel on, was it yesterday?
[00:56:06.537 --> 00:56:07.998]  Yeah.
[00:56:08.338 --> 00:56:13.021]  You know, he made some really good points, Ben, that I think that a lot of us are missing out on.
[00:56:13.162 --> 00:56:17.104]  The secondary war is actually the one that's here in our skin.
[00:56:17.725 --> 00:56:19.206]  The other war started a long time ago.
[00:56:19.847 --> 00:56:21.267]  And that's what people need to realize.
[00:56:21.488 --> 00:56:25.809]  And I've talked to you before, and I've told you before, man, just keep your heart soft as much as you can.
[00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.589]  And you have gone nuts before, and that's great.
[00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:29.630]  I understand the emotional side.
[00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:38.493]  And actually, it was when you dressed up like Darth Vader a long time ago that got me hooked on you, because I thought, who is this guy?
[00:56:38.553 --> 00:56:41.034]  And I have to commend you, man, because you know what?
[00:56:42.354 --> 00:56:44.315]  You've inspired me to be a man of truth.
[00:56:45.315 --> 00:56:48.316]  A man to seek out truth in all things.
[00:56:49.208 --> 00:56:52.550]  And, um, you know, you're a wise man, Alex, you're a wise man.
[00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:59.153]  And to be honest, I don't know how in the world your wife puts up with you, because I guarantee you're not leaving this stuff, uh... Hold on, hold on just a minute.
[00:56:59.433 --> 00:57:00.454]  Hold on just a minute there.
[00:57:00.914 --> 00:57:01.274]  Okay?
[00:57:02.034 --> 00:57:08.798]  Um, I'm gonna skip this break and go ahead and finish up, uh, talking to... We're talking to Rick in Indiana, right?
[00:57:09.518 --> 00:57:09.838]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:10.118 --> 00:57:12.119]  Because these lines are going crazy here on my screen.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:12.940]  So many... Okay.
[00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.181]  Uh, Rick, go ahead and finish up the point you were making.
[00:57:16.364 --> 00:57:21.867]  Just the point is that you have a gift, man, and I truly believe that.
[00:57:22.067 --> 00:57:26.269]  And the guy that you just talked to from Canada, telling my intuition, that's what's actually taken over.
[00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:30.312]  I mean, before I even knew any of this stuff, I mean, I was literally a zombie.
[00:57:30.332 --> 00:57:31.192]  I was one of the sheeple.
[00:57:31.973 --> 00:57:33.854]  And I quit drinking my public water.
[00:57:34.574 --> 00:57:35.775]  I shut my television off.
[00:57:36.695 --> 00:57:39.337]  I literally quit a lifestyle that I was living.
[00:57:40.577 --> 00:57:43.679]  And finding out some of the truth and what's going on in my reality today,
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.581]  Encourage me to go and find out the history of what's happened.
[00:57:48.302 --> 00:57:53.263]  The hijacking of this country a long time ago, this is all formulated, and it all goes way back.
[00:57:54.004 --> 00:57:57.585]  And they admit all of it, and they've done it over and over again in other countries.
[00:57:58.145 --> 00:57:58.405]  Sure.
[00:57:58.665 --> 00:58:02.687]  And here's the thing, and you know this, the masses will be deceived.
[00:58:03.727 --> 00:58:13.151]  And I called you one time, I tried to encourage you, I tried to say, man, just listen, don't let what hurt your heart, and I understand you're passionate for this country, for the people, and for what this idea was, but
[00:58:13.621 --> 00:58:26.023]  One of the points that an elderly man made to me one time, and he was a World War II vet, he's dead now, but he made a point to me a long time ago that I didn't quite understand what he said from the beginning, but he said that we are living on cursed ground in this country.
[00:58:26.203 --> 00:58:27.643]  And I thought, why do you say that?
[00:58:28.664 --> 00:58:31.084]  And he said, because we stole this country a long time ago.
[00:58:32.144 --> 00:58:33.464]  We stole this country from the beginning.
[00:58:33.805 --> 00:58:39.586]  We raped and slaughtered a people prior to, you know, the Cuban being a nation.
[00:58:40.506 --> 00:58:42.306]  And he said the sovereignty of this nation
[00:58:43.227 --> 00:58:44.407]  Is a falsehood to begin with.
[00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:47.168]  And he said, and what people should do, and I never got into it.
[00:58:47.208 --> 00:58:48.988]  I think I was maybe 16 or 17 at the time.
[00:58:49.008 --> 00:58:51.408]  I just had my 37th birthday yesterday, so yay me.
[00:58:51.709 --> 00:58:52.049]  I made it.
[00:58:53.469 --> 00:58:54.369]  But he made a comment.
[00:58:54.409 --> 00:59:00.950]  He said that, you know, people should start doing a little research on who the people were that were here a long time ago and start looking into the Lost Tribes.
[00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.971]  Now, I haven't started doing that yet, but he was talking about the Lost Tribes of Israel.
[00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:06.911]  And I thought, how in the world would they get here?
[00:59:07.111 --> 00:59:08.891]  You know, and I've always thought that.
[00:59:08.931 --> 00:59:09.872]  How did the Indians get here?
[00:59:09.952 --> 00:59:11.512]  Why did the South American Indians look different?
[00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:13.215]  North American Indians and uh...
[00:59:13.857 --> 00:59:16.918]  The Samoans look different than the Hawaiians, and the Filipinos look different.
[00:59:16.938 --> 00:59:20.638]  It's like, all this stuff, you know, it's like, we will never get to the bottom of all this.
[00:59:20.658 --> 00:59:25.459]  Well, it's like Easter Island had a Caucasian group in it, and then they got overtaken by another group.
[00:59:25.479 --> 00:59:32.461]  Yeah, there's a whole other history we don't know about, and all the Viking runes, and the Vikings, and pre-modern Norse.
[00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:33.761]  Absolutely.
[00:59:33.841 --> 00:59:34.601]  That they've dug up.
[00:59:34.621 --> 00:59:35.221]  We're out of time.
[00:59:35.261 --> 00:59:36.882]  I appreciate you calling.
[00:59:37.522 --> 00:59:39.482]  And we've got all these other callers, John.
[00:59:40.362 --> 00:59:43.023]  I guess, did I go to Lindsey, or did I skip Lindsey?
[00:59:43.243 --> 00:59:44.264]  You skipped to Rick.
[00:59:44.324 --> 00:59:46.966]  Next is Kyle and PA and then Lindsey.
[00:59:48.046 --> 00:59:49.127]  Just give them all to me again.
[00:59:49.147 --> 00:59:50.428]  This screen's got too much on it.
[00:59:50.628 --> 00:59:51.649]  Okay.
[00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:57.533]  Did you find the original one where they introduce and Kucinich goes after him?
[00:59:58.474 --> 01:00:02.597]  I sent you the entire thing off cspan.org.
[01:00:03.477 --> 01:00:05.599]  I saw you say it's on cspan, but do you have the link?
[01:00:05.999 --> 01:00:06.940]  Yeah, I sent you that link.
[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:07.820]  I can resend it to you.
[01:00:08.381 --> 01:00:09.602]  With callers, too.
[01:00:09.802 --> 01:00:12.644]  And then I'm expecting George Butler to call me back any second now.
[01:00:13.988 --> 01:00:16.709]  Let's cancel that because that was a quick thing.
[01:00:16.749 --> 01:00:18.489]  Let's move them in tomorrow or something.
[01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.550]  Okay, I'll tell them where... Okay.
[01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:21.951]  Here we go.
[01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:29.093]  Alright, I want to go to some of your phone calls.
[01:00:30.185 --> 01:00:34.206]  But I promised to air some of these clips, and these aren't even the best ones that we've found.
[01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:40.328]  We're getting some of the most powerful clips, and tomorrow I'll play more of them.
[01:00:41.108 --> 01:00:46.870]  We have a guest coming up in about 22 minutes, and I also want to get to a few of your calls, so let's go ahead and play this short clip.
[01:00:48.203 --> 01:01:00.213]  And this short clip is just a response after Kashkari, after 20 minutes of talking to one of the other congressmen, will never answer any of the questions.
[01:01:00.634 --> 01:01:01.394]  So here it is.
[01:01:03.816 --> 01:01:05.698]  Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.
[01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:11.743]  Just to Mr. Cummings, I don't know how to work any harder than we're already working.
[01:01:12.452 --> 01:01:14.654]  And I take your feedback very seriously.
[01:01:15.094 --> 01:01:20.057]  That's why we're working as hard as we are and we're just going to keep doing and trying to accomplish and meet your expectations.
[01:01:20.358 --> 01:01:20.918]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:21.218 --> 01:01:32.226]  If I may take the prerogative as chair to say I don't think anyone questions Mr. Kashkari that you're working hard.
[01:01:33.927 --> 01:01:36.809]  Our question is who you're working for.
[01:01:40.592 --> 01:01:41.673]  That will conclude
[01:01:42.814 --> 01:01:46.318]  This first panel, I want to thank you for your presence here.
[01:01:48.119 --> 01:01:53.925]  As Mr. Cummings said, I know that it cannot have been easy.
[01:01:53.965 --> 01:01:57.088]  You've been answering questions for over two hours.
[01:01:58.211 --> 01:01:59.632]  I'm sorry, I've got to play that again.
[01:01:59.652 --> 01:02:06.438]  I mean, folks, this went on for four hours, and I only got to watch an hour of it, and these are the clips I'm seeing from later in the hearing.
[01:02:07.238 --> 01:02:09.060]  The question is, who are you working for?
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.983]  This is Congress questions, who are you working for, Mr. Cashman?
[01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:20.689]  We're going to get this up in the Paul Watson story so it's easy to find at theprisonplanet.com story he wrote.
[01:02:22.685 --> 01:02:23.646]  I've got to play this again.
[01:02:23.686 --> 01:02:24.807]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:02:25.508 --> 01:02:26.188]  I mean, I love it.
[01:02:26.228 --> 01:02:27.149]  This is the type of stuff.
[01:02:27.169 --> 01:02:27.870]  You're criminals.
[01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:29.291]  You don't work for us.
[01:02:29.552 --> 01:02:30.753]  We know you're scamming us.
[01:02:30.773 --> 01:02:32.074]  We don't want your New World Order.
[01:02:32.735 --> 01:02:34.837]  And they can't blow up all the Congressmen's airplanes.
[01:02:35.237 --> 01:02:36.758]  They can't have martial law everywhere.
[01:02:36.778 --> 01:02:39.961]  If we just stand up and say, the Emperor's wearing no clothes.
[01:02:40.282 --> 01:02:41.163]  You are criminals.
[01:02:41.403 --> 01:02:42.364]  You are the New World Order.
[01:02:42.384 --> 01:02:44.005]  We could arrest all these people.
[01:02:45.126 --> 01:02:46.748]  We could have our country and our world back.
[01:02:49.042 --> 01:02:53.483]  But until you get up off your butts out there and stop living in denial, it ain't gonna happen.
[01:02:54.183 --> 01:02:55.284]  Now, you want a carbon tax?
[01:02:55.324 --> 01:02:56.204]  You want a world government?
[01:02:56.624 --> 01:02:59.705]  You want tattletale squads and spies watching everything you do?
[01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:01.666]  Then keep sucking your thumbs, America.
[01:03:02.106 --> 01:03:03.766]  Get rid of the baseball, the football.
[01:03:04.026 --> 01:03:06.367]  Stop spending your time being blobs.
[01:03:07.067 --> 01:03:08.707]  Get involved in real issues, or it's over!
[01:03:08.847 --> 01:03:10.088]  Your children's future's over!
[01:03:10.288 --> 01:03:11.148]  Your future's over!
[01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:13.549]  You're not gonna have to wait until the future like we kept warning you.
[01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:14.409]  We're here now.
[01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:17.710]  Punch it back up, please.
[01:03:23.055 --> 01:03:24.937]  Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.
[01:03:26.278 --> 01:03:33.924]  Just to Mr. Cummings, I don't know how to work any harder than we're already working, and I take your feedback very seriously.
[01:03:34.365 --> 01:03:39.309]  That's why we're working as hard as we are, and we're just going to keep doing and trying to accomplish and meet your expectations.
[01:03:39.609 --> 01:03:40.550]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:45.614]  If I may take the prerogative as chair to say, I don't think anyone
[01:03:46.894 --> 01:03:51.477]  Questions, Mr. Kashkari, that you're working hard.
[01:03:53.158 --> 01:03:56.060]  Our question is who you're working for.
[01:03:59.822 --> 01:04:03.284]  That will conclude this first panel.
[01:04:03.305 --> 01:04:05.586]  I want to thank you for your presence here.
[01:04:07.387 --> 01:04:13.191]  As Mr. Cummings said, I know that it cannot have been easy.
[01:04:13.231 --> 01:04:16.353]  You've been answering questions for over two hours.
[01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:25.837]  And the committee will take note that you have engaged in a thoughtful Q&A here.
[01:04:26.878 --> 01:04:27.698]  So we appreciate it.
[01:04:27.799 --> 01:04:30.301]  Just want you to know it's much appreciated.
[01:04:31.122 --> 01:04:32.823]  And we understand the burden of your office.
[01:04:34.144 --> 01:04:38.929]  So we're going to thank Mr. Kashkari for his presence here.
[01:04:39.574 --> 01:04:41.355]  And we're going to move on to the second panel.
[01:04:41.395 --> 01:04:45.878]  I would ask the witnesses from the second panel to come to the committee table.
[01:04:46.619 --> 01:04:48.460]  And thank you again, Mr. Stay tuned.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.103]  Kashkari gets some feedback from attendees as he departs.
[01:04:52.143 --> 01:04:53.143]  Get ready to hear this.
[01:04:53.804 --> 01:04:56.746]  They're not buying your garbage anymore, you little arrogant criminal.
[01:04:57.106 --> 01:04:58.667]  Kashkari, for your presence, sir.
[01:05:06.886 --> 01:05:14.595]  The committee will take a five minute recess while the table is set up for the second panel.
[01:05:24.948 --> 01:05:25.969]  Testing, testing, testing.
[01:05:42.117 --> 01:05:43.558]  Alright folks, that is one of the clips.
[01:05:43.578 --> 01:05:45.420]  Let me now go to some of the other clips.
[01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:16.966]  John, it's a good thing that you have it all up there in your computer, because my computer's acting weird, and I want to play this out of the network computer.
[01:06:16.986 --> 01:06:19.586]  Do you have that first clip that I sent you?
[01:06:20.307 --> 01:06:22.327]  I just have to transfer it over, and it'll be ready in two seconds.
[01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:23.547]  All right.
[01:06:24.888 --> 01:06:26.048]  We'll play that from your end.
[01:06:27.168 --> 01:06:30.769]  And again, tomorrow I'll have all these clipped down to specific parts.
[01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:33.130]  I mean, I've only been able to watch an hour of it live this morning.
[01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:34.810]  It just ended about an hour ago.
[01:06:36.824 --> 01:06:40.407]  But here is one of the clips right now for you.
[01:06:41.567 --> 01:06:50.794]  This is where Congressman Issa is trying to nail him down, and the way he lies and weevils and never answers the question.
[01:06:52.835 --> 01:06:54.136]  You've got to watch the body language.
[01:06:54.216 --> 01:06:58.138]  Radio takes a lot away from this, but you can watch the videos up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:06:58.158 --> 01:06:58.459]  Here it is.
[01:07:06.172 --> 01:07:19.547]  It has been said that your purchases of $250 billion plus of preferred stock is at a price that would not be market competitive, meaning you paid too much.
[01:07:20.488 --> 01:07:25.474]  Tell me why I'm to believe for a minute that those preferred stocks that you bought
[01:07:27.825 --> 01:07:29.685]  You could resell today for anything closed.
[01:07:29.725 --> 01:07:31.226]  Remember, the market has improved.
[01:07:31.566 --> 01:07:32.166]  You've said that.
[01:07:32.646 --> 01:07:38.587]  Tell me what the profit would be on those preferred stocks if you began putting even one dollar into the market today.
[01:07:40.027 --> 01:07:42.128]  Congressman, I don't know what the price would be.
[01:07:42.208 --> 01:07:43.588]  Okay, well, you're from Goldman Sachs.
[01:07:44.288 --> 01:07:45.108]  I used to work there.
[01:07:45.388 --> 01:07:48.069]  Okay, well, I'm from Directed Electronics.
[01:07:48.089 --> 01:07:49.349]  You're from your last job.
[01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:53.910]  If you tell me that you've improved the market,
[01:07:54.764 --> 01:07:59.146]  Then by definition, those assets, if bought at par, have appreciated.
[01:07:59.186 --> 01:07:59.727]  Isn't that true?
[01:08:00.707 --> 01:08:04.649]  Well, there are many... Again, with deep respect, Congressman, there are many different markets.
[01:08:04.669 --> 01:08:05.549]  There's the equity market.
[01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:06.490]  There's the credit markets.
[01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:08.111]  I think there are strong signs.
[01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:10.872]  I can walk you through data showing the credit markets improving.
[01:08:11.152 --> 01:08:12.913]  The equity markets... We purchase equity.
[01:08:13.353 --> 01:08:14.234]  The equity markets are struggling.
[01:08:14.254 --> 01:08:15.695]  You purchased a debt instrument.
[01:08:16.375 --> 01:08:18.256]  Well, it's tier one capital, Congressman.
[01:08:19.321 --> 01:08:29.966]  You know, we can go ring around the rosy here, but you're here today because Congress is feeling that you played a bait-and-switch game, and you're not convincing anyone that you haven't.
[01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:33.468]  But let's just try to go to the fundamentals.
[01:08:33.508 --> 01:08:34.689]  You bought Preferred Stock.
[01:08:34.829 --> 01:08:35.149]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:36.870]  Preferred Stock is a dead instrument.
[01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:40.892]  You're capitalizing the company, but you're capitalizing with a dead instrument.
[01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:42.786]  Those instruments trade.
[01:08:42.906 --> 01:08:49.911]  I have BB&T, I have a number of dead instruments of that sort.
[01:08:50.811 --> 01:08:57.976]  They have in fact appreciated from the time you bought till today in various portfolios.
[01:08:58.377 --> 01:09:02.039]  So I'm looking at those and I'm following a lot more of those kinds of instruments.
[01:09:02.699 --> 01:09:03.660]  They have appreciated.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:09.944]  So my question to you today, under oath, as someone who should know about this is, are your
[01:09:11.702 --> 01:09:17.105]  Candidly, Congressman, I don't know.
[01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:22.067]  We have independent valuation firms that are going to provide regular reporting on the current valuation.
[01:09:22.127 --> 01:09:23.507]  Regular reporting starting when?
[01:09:23.707 --> 01:09:24.408]  You're here today.
[01:09:24.428 --> 01:09:27.509]  Do you have any regular reporting from the day you bought them until today?
[01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:34.032]  We've published the reports to the Treasury website within 48 hours of completing the transactions on the terms.
[01:09:35.373 --> 01:09:36.493]  Right now, we're in the process.
[01:09:36.513 --> 01:09:40.235]  Just yesterday, the Equity Asset Manager solicitations concluded.
[01:09:40.875 --> 01:09:49.578]  Well, wouldn't it be reasonable for us to believe here today that if, in fact, you have improved the market, that those assets that you purchase, we'll call them equities since they're a hybrid, have appreciated?
[01:10:06.718 --> 01:10:09.722]  I think they'd be reasonable relative to the day that we bought them.
[01:10:09.742 --> 01:10:20.355]  Okay, so if we find out on the next report, which I hope is forthcoming and we will be looking for it, that they are below par, then in fact you paid too much, right?
[01:10:20.936 --> 01:10:24.300]  Well, again, it depends, Congressman, what our objective was.
[01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.201]  Our objective was
[01:10:25.856 --> 01:10:32.802]  To create a program that would encourage thousands of banks across our country to voluntarily apply and to use the capital.
[01:10:33.182 --> 01:10:36.264]  And so we intentionally made it attractive for them to want to apply.
[01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:49.055]  So you believe here today that you had authority to subsidize banks including providing them this capital at a below par, a below fair market, of a market that should have existed but didn't exist.
[01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:54.253]  Well, Congressman, as you know, the market when we did this was... there wasn't a market.
[01:10:55.154 --> 01:10:57.395]  Most banks couldn't raise private capital.
[01:10:57.515 --> 01:10:59.737]  No, no, but we're in a better market today.
[01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:06.501]  Understand, one of the reasons for the question is you've thrown $350 billion, including AIG and so on, out there.
[01:11:06.521 --> 01:11:08.643]  You're coming back for another $350 billion.
[01:11:09.383 --> 01:11:12.926]  If, in fact, what we discover, and I believe here today,
[01:11:13.955 --> 01:11:21.180]  Is that your $350 billion, and let's just look at $250 billion, we'll leave AIG, which is a whole other can of worms, aside.
[01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:37.893]  If that money, in fact, is a subsidy arriving at a price below the fair market price, thus causing banks to choose you, including banks in my district, choose you instead of other capital, all you've really done is give them a discount capital.
[01:11:38.433 --> 01:11:43.457]  Now, the reason I ask that is, how large is the capital base necessary for the banking industry?
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.602]  And they go on to say $55 trillion, so this does nothing.
[01:11:47.822 --> 01:11:52.725]  They're just stealing the money in the final equation, and they won't tell us where $2 trillion went.
[01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:57.228]  We'll be right back after this quick break, right here on the GCN Radio Network with a lot more.
[01:11:57.248 --> 01:11:57.669]  Stay with us.
[01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:07.960]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.160]  And let me explain, callers.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.440]  You're not on the AM and FM now.
[01:12:10.901 --> 01:12:19.824]  You're not on the shortwave or satellite, but you're on the internet with tens of thousands listening on the audio, thousands watching on the video, and so it will then be posted at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:19.844 --> 01:12:23.185]  It'll be ripped to YouTube, so you will live on forever with your comments.
[01:12:23.525 --> 01:12:26.626]  It's better to go to you behind the scenes than never get to your calls.
[01:12:27.207 --> 01:12:30.048]  So that is what I'm doing right now.
[01:12:31.428 --> 01:12:35.550]  Let us go ahead and talk to Kyle in PA, Lindsey, Josh, Blake.
[01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:38.612]  I'm going to get to you guys before the show ends today of the Hairlips the Admiral.
[01:12:39.392 --> 01:12:40.553]  Kyle, you're on the air.
[01:12:40.693 --> 01:12:42.194]  Kyle just dropped.
[01:12:42.234 --> 01:12:44.655]  I'm not going to get to him whether the Hairlips the Admiral.
[01:12:45.235 --> 01:12:47.617]  Let's talk to Lindsey in Idaho.
[01:12:47.637 --> 01:12:48.577]  You're on the air, Lindsey.
[01:12:49.037 --> 01:12:49.998]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:12:50.038 --> 01:12:50.558]  How are you?
[01:12:50.678 --> 01:12:50.958]  Good.
[01:12:52.919 --> 01:12:55.921]  Cut off the subject on the bailout, but I had
[01:12:56.607 --> 01:13:01.451]  Gotten some information in red about it, and I'm sure you've heard of that Red List, Blue List, FEMA thing.
[01:13:02.832 --> 01:13:16.602]  Okay, well of course, got on Google, found out, you know, different things on that, and this is just for some people, it's interesting to me, about the location of FEMA camps, and they, you know, they have them listed state by state.
[01:13:17.501 --> 01:13:18.441]  Of all these FEMA camps.
[01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:27.763]  Oh yeah, the FEMA admits they have it, and then people never will go look at it, and when you finally show them a camp, they go, well that's not a concentration camp, it's a whole dissenter!
[01:13:27.923 --> 01:13:29.163]  Alex, this is perfect.
[01:13:29.203 --> 01:13:31.424]  You're familiar with Google Earth, I'm sure.
[01:13:31.844 --> 01:13:32.104]  Yes.
[01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:33.204]  Okay.
[01:13:33.304 --> 01:13:34.745]  When you try to look them up, they're blacked out.
[01:13:35.505 --> 01:13:35.825]  Pardon?
[01:13:36.385 --> 01:13:38.565]  When you try to look them up, they're grayed out.
[01:13:39.065 --> 01:13:39.586]  Oh, no.
[01:13:40.046 --> 01:13:43.066]  No, I'm looking at one right now that will blow your mind.
[01:13:43.566 --> 01:13:46.127]  I live in Idaho, so, curious enough, I
[01:13:47.057 --> 01:13:49.998]  Look down the list, and there's Idaho, and there's one that's listed.
[01:13:50.058 --> 01:13:56.880]  It's called, and if anybody cares to look it up, because I'm looking at it now, so I can tell about this.
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:58.200]  It's called Moose Creek.
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:00.221]  It's right by the Montana state line.
[01:14:00.801 --> 01:14:05.242]  It says, this unmanned facility is reported to have a nearby airfield.
[01:14:05.302 --> 01:14:13.064]  So I went to Google Earth, typed in Moose Creek, Idaho, and right now I'm looking at an elevation of 6,674 feet, and there is the
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:20.723]  Most incredible airstrip on the top of these mountains.
[01:14:21.864 --> 01:14:26.246]  And there is a facility just north of the airstrip, a bridge to the south of it.
[01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:35.032]  And if people don't believe that some of these things are in remote locations, I highly advise them to go look at this one.
[01:14:35.152 --> 01:14:36.373]  It will blow your mind.
[01:14:36.795 --> 01:14:39.376]  This thing is so remote, it's incredible.
[01:14:39.896 --> 01:14:42.096]  And you can see the barbed wire fences and guard towers?
[01:14:42.236 --> 01:14:42.857]  Well, no.
[01:14:42.957 --> 01:14:44.037]  Now that's the next part.
[01:14:44.077 --> 01:14:45.817]  This is what really has made me curious.
[01:14:45.877 --> 01:14:53.079]  I've been watching this aerial view and going from different directions for probably three or four hours over the last few days.
[01:14:53.979 --> 01:15:04.262]  And at the north end of the airstrip are two obvious facilities, but there's no barbed wire fencing or anything.
[01:15:05.254 --> 01:15:08.557]  Uh, of any nature of that, but there's two distinct facilities.
[01:15:08.597 --> 01:15:10.819]  You can see them from about 2,300 feet.
[01:15:10.899 --> 01:15:13.462]  After that, the resolution starts to get a little crummy.
[01:15:14.362 --> 01:15:28.475]  Uh, anyway, my point being is this particular facility is easily seen, and also it, then if you Google out, if you, if you scope out and go to an altitude of like
[01:15:29.039 --> 01:15:32.681]  Oh, about airplane flying height, about 35,000 feet or so.
[01:15:33.241 --> 01:15:43.606]  This place is so remote, the only way to get into it is this airstrip, or by horseback, or... Well, I mean, it's been in the Associated Press.
[01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:50.009]  They built forest forced labor camps in the forest of Idaho and Oregon, and it's been on the news there.
[01:15:50.549 --> 01:15:57.831]  And it's been all over the news that they have the civilian inmate labor camp programs, 24 of them they list, secretly with American citizens in them since 86.
[01:15:58.551 --> 01:16:01.272]  Now declassified that they kept Americans in camp secretly.
[01:16:01.592 --> 01:16:06.193]  What people should do is go photograph these, go videotape these, and then do articles about them.
[01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:12.595]  Because a lot of folks are going and showing the camps with the guard towers, but then they don't show that they went there off a government document.
[01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:14.875]  Then people then say, oh, that's not a real camp.
[01:16:15.215 --> 01:16:17.116]  So we need you guys to go out and research it.
[01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:17.836]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:17.856 --> 01:16:18.136]  Here we go.
[01:16:30.762 --> 01:16:33.444]  Welcome to your life!
[01:16:35.045 --> 01:16:39.087]  There's no turning back.
[01:16:39.348 --> 01:16:39.428]  No?
[01:16:39.488 --> 01:16:43.530]  Even while we... All right, here's representative Elijah Cummings.
[01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:44.951]  He really
[01:16:47.825 --> 01:16:59.452]  He really reached out to the representative of the Treasury Department, Tajkari.
[01:17:01.058 --> 01:17:02.779]  And Kashkari wouldn't answer his questions.
[01:17:02.799 --> 01:17:07.140]  So I'm going to go ahead and play some of that for you right now from the hearings this morning.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:08.601]  5 trillion stolen.
[01:17:08.881 --> 01:17:10.301]  They won't even tell you where 2 trillion went.
[01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:15.103]  The public's told it's 700 billion and they're giving none of it to where they swore to give it to get the economy going.
[01:17:15.143 --> 01:17:19.824]  They're keeping all of it while locking down the currency and the credit to destroy the economy.
[01:17:20.205 --> 01:17:21.085]  So here it is.
[01:17:26.383 --> 01:17:27.924]  The Chair recognizes Mr. Cummings.
[01:17:27.964 --> 01:17:28.704]  You may proceed.
[01:17:29.004 --> 01:17:33.026]  Mr. Cox, Kerry, I'm still listening carefully.
[01:17:34.347 --> 01:17:35.547]  Let me ask you a few questions.
[01:17:35.767 --> 01:17:53.676]  One of the reasons why I voted for the bailout, very reluctantly, held my nose, closed my eyes and prayed, is because President-elect Obama, at that time, has assured me that if he were elected,
[01:17:54.258 --> 01:18:01.525]  President that he would work on making sure that the people that might be losing their houses through foreclosure would be helped.
[01:18:02.986 --> 01:18:06.549]  If President Obama came to you, I don't know how long you're going to be around.
[01:18:06.569 --> 01:18:11.714]  So I mean, I assume somebody is going to ask Paulson or somebody this question.
[01:18:12.715 --> 01:18:20.742]  But if President-elect Obama came to you and said, give me your best advice as to how I can help
[01:18:22.014 --> 01:18:26.417]  How I can help people who are facing foreclosure?
[01:18:28.598 --> 01:18:29.659]  What would you tell him?
[01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:36.043]  Congressman, that's a very important question that I spend a lot of time thinking about.
[01:18:36.683 --> 01:18:48.170]  The best thing I think we can do as a country to help the housing market and avoid foreclosures is to bring mortgage rates down for borrowers so they can refinance into long-term sustainable mortgages that they can afford.
[01:18:49.421 --> 01:18:59.790]  And the way to do that, partly what we did was stabilizing Fannie and Freddie, was to stabilize mortgage finance, and some of the actions we're looking at, trying to get credit flowing again, is to bring rates down for our consumers.
[01:19:00.210 --> 01:19:04.674]  If we can bring mortgage rates down, as you know... Now again, just to be clear, this went on for four hours.
[01:19:04.694 --> 01:19:06.075]  In fact, it's still going on.
[01:19:06.656 --> 01:19:07.877]  They're just on to a new part of the hearing.
[01:19:11.508 --> 01:19:13.309]  I thought this was what from the start of the hearing.
[01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.750]  The stuff at the start is ten times more powerful than all of this.
[01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:17.791]  And wait till I find that on the web.
[01:19:17.912 --> 01:19:21.013]  I know listeners heard the show, went and grabbed what was on later.
[01:19:21.033 --> 01:19:27.917]  And this has been important as well, but tomorrow I am definitely going to have for you the start of the hearing.
[01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:33.260]  C-SPAN.org has the earlier start of the hearing, but the video is not playing.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.461]  It's getting so many hits and we can't get it.
[01:19:37.282 --> 01:19:38.183]  I have it recorded here.
[01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:43.766]  Tomorrow, we're going to have the first 30 minutes of that hearing for you, and just the whole interchange.
[01:19:43.786 --> 01:19:45.707]  We'll air it unedited in between the breaks.
[01:19:45.727 --> 01:19:51.290]  You know, the breaks will break it up, but I'm going to play it continuously so you can hear what went on and what happened.
[01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:56.132]  I mean, just to get the idea, because I watched it for an hour this morning of how Kashkari is a complete snake.
[01:19:56.432 --> 01:19:57.453]  This is a bunch of babble.
[01:19:57.853 --> 01:20:03.676]  So let's skip ahead and see what the congressman, because the congressman really was powerful when he first talked to him.
[01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:04.817]  I don't even know what this is right here.
[01:20:05.157 --> 01:20:05.777]  No, Congressman.
[01:20:06.358 --> 01:20:17.886]  Our housing system is very volatile.
[01:20:18.826 --> 01:20:20.748]  Let me go back to Fannie Mae and Freddie.
[01:20:21.888 --> 01:20:32.035]  I had asked you before, a little bit earlier, about how this loss, this announcement on Monday, the $29 billion loss
[01:20:33.855 --> 01:20:39.879]  Affects, if at all, what you are trying to do to help the homeowner through Fannie Mae.
[01:20:40.079 --> 01:20:41.260]  I mean, does it affect it?
[01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.682]  Well, excuse me, sir, not directly.
[01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:51.607]  We had, when we took our actions in July and August to stabilize Fannie and Freddie, we expected big losses to come.
[01:20:52.067 --> 01:20:56.350]  And so we sized these $100 billion contracts to be big enough to deal with those losses.
[01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:58.392]  So we're not surprised by it.
[01:20:58.992 --> 01:20:59.812]  We knew they were coming.
[01:21:00.273 --> 01:21:03.355]  And we don't think that that directly affects what we can do with Fannie and Freddie.
[01:21:05.211 --> 01:21:12.937]  Now, you know, I was intrigued by Mr. Ice's questions, and I want to give you a broader question, sort of hooked up with his.
[01:21:14.259 --> 01:21:20.404]  You know, you all have to make some tough decisions as to where this $700 billion is going.
[01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:33.054]  And the American people, and this is what I hear at the supermarket and at the gas station when I run into my neighbors, they think that there's a whole line of people who are lined up with their hands out.
[01:21:34.284 --> 01:21:35.404]  They're looking at GM.
[01:21:36.365 --> 01:21:40.346]  They're looking at all these other folks who are saying, government bail us out.
[01:21:41.986 --> 01:21:43.247]  And I want to know two things.
[01:21:43.547 --> 01:21:49.468]  One, what goes into the decision-making with regard to, you know, the bailout.
[01:21:49.548 --> 01:21:53.889]  I know, I mean, I know you guys... Alright, I'm going to keep playing it during the break.
[01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.130]  Go ahead and get Darryl Randerson.
[01:21:55.150 --> 01:21:55.990]  You got his number, right?
[01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:57.631]  He's all set and ready.
[01:21:58.391 --> 01:21:58.851]  Okay, great.
[01:21:58.871 --> 01:21:59.251]  Here we go.
[01:21:59.771 --> 01:22:02.632]  Certain strictures you got to go, go by.
[01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:09.464]  And how do you all try to make sure that whatever the objective is...
[01:22:10.544 --> 01:22:11.545]  It happens.
[01:22:11.565 --> 01:22:13.506]  In other words, do you need more authority from us?
[01:22:14.066 --> 01:22:36.398]  Because I've got to tell you, one of the most disappointing things for me is when you all gave the banks money and then I read the next day that a lot of the banks were not going to be loaning money, and I understand what you were trying to do, loaning money, and that they were going to use the money to acquire other banks, that they were going to use the money to not make the cuts that they needed to make and all that kind of stuff.
[01:22:37.059 --> 01:22:39.220]  So now we face a situation with GM.
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.961]  And a lot of us are saying, you know what?
[01:22:43.141 --> 01:22:46.923]  One out of every ten jobs is connected with the automobile industry.
[01:22:47.584 --> 01:22:56.848]  We want to make sure that we don't lose a GM or lose any of our automobile companies because they're so important to our economy.
[01:22:57.428 --> 01:23:07.613]  But at the same time, the American people are saying, and we want to make sure that if they got some money, that they move towards making sure they're energy efficient cars and they're competitive and all that.
[01:23:08.903 --> 01:23:17.407]  So how do you all, you know, say, okay, we're going to give, like Mr. Eisen was saying, you're going to give to this company, you're going to give to this bank, how are you going to do that?
[01:23:18.248 --> 01:23:25.111]  And so what is the objective and how do you make sure that the objective is achieved?
[01:23:25.452 --> 01:23:30.954]  In other words, you can't guarantee, but create the best possible circumstance to have it achieved.
[01:23:31.555 --> 01:23:33.596]  And do you need more authority from us?
[01:23:34.474 --> 01:23:44.000]  To achieve that, because I'm going to tell you, the American people are running out of patience, and you know, my friends Mr. Issa and Mr. Kucinich voted against the legislation.
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:48.222]  I'm going to tell you, I venture to guess most of us wanted to vote against it, even the ones that voted for it.
[01:23:49.043 --> 01:23:54.686]  So, I'm trying to figure out, how do you tell me, how do you do that?
[01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:55.406]  You follow me?
[01:23:55.947 --> 01:24:02.991]  Because at some point, the Congress is going to say, sorry, no more, because you know what, the American people
[01:24:03.712 --> 01:24:04.693]  I'm saying it already.
[01:24:06.634 --> 01:24:09.095]  So, Congressman, these are very good questions, and let's talk through them.
[01:24:09.155 --> 01:24:10.316]  I appreciate you asking them.
[01:24:10.836 --> 01:24:14.478]  First of all, if you look at the capital program... No, let's not hear from you.
[01:24:14.498 --> 01:24:17.540]  Now, you see that congressman not getting it.
[01:24:18.041 --> 01:24:20.202]  That bill said they could rob and steal all the money.
[01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.224]  The bill already said that in it.
[01:24:24.644 --> 01:24:25.005]  Okay?
[01:24:25.245 --> 01:24:27.666]  And the bankers are the ones that engineered all of this.
[01:24:27.686 --> 01:24:30.408]  They don't care about anybody, Congressman Cunningham.
[01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:37.051]  They don't care what the American people want.
[01:24:37.091 --> 01:24:38.211]  It's about control.
[01:24:38.652 --> 01:24:42.353]  They want an imploding economy so they can control the population.
[01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:44.994]  And he says, do you need more authority?
[01:24:45.014 --> 01:24:48.656]  They already have unlimited criminal fiat authority.
[01:24:48.736 --> 01:24:49.916]  They set all this up.
[01:24:50.777 --> 01:24:56.619]  They're going to tell the public we need more authority, world government authority, run by the bankers to fix all of this.
[01:25:01.909 --> 01:25:06.572]  John, you got both ISDN lines connected and I'm not getting audio on the main Comrex.
[01:25:07.613 --> 01:25:10.395]  Okay, I can go ahead and switch over to the backup.
[01:25:10.415 --> 01:25:12.036]  You're not sending me audio on it, that's why.
[01:25:12.056 --> 01:25:13.977]  So go ahead and send me audio on it.
[01:25:14.398 --> 01:25:15.098]  Okay, here we go.
[01:25:39.033 --> 01:25:40.295]  All right, folks, we are back live.
[01:25:40.315 --> 01:25:41.937]  I want to go right to Darryl Mundus.
[01:25:43.544 --> 01:25:45.425]  Darryl's had a long, interesting life.
[01:25:45.445 --> 01:25:46.326]  I've done a lot of things.
[01:25:46.346 --> 01:25:49.949]  I don't know how much he wants to get into himself on air, but I'll let him introduce himself.
[01:25:50.409 --> 01:25:51.710]  And he has some ideas.
[01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:53.471]  A lot of people have ideas of things we need to do.
[01:25:54.052 --> 01:25:58.195]  But he's also contributed to what we do here financially, and we appreciate him.
[01:25:58.555 --> 01:26:02.058]  But, you know, he's thought of ideas to try to create an InfoWars bootcamp.
[01:26:03.387 --> 01:26:03.427]  No.
[01:26:20.228 --> 01:26:24.471]  I don't know, hundreds of thousands of Christians to go out and win souls, effectively.
[01:26:25.111 --> 01:26:32.176]  And he's really convinced me, you know, he's a salesman in his own right, and has one of the largest companies out there with direct marketing.
[01:26:32.897 --> 01:26:47.567]  He's the guy that started the stuff in the grocery store, where you walk in, the people are there with the shirt and tie, and they're saying, hey, you know, get a t-shirt when you sign up for the Austin American Statesman, or the Dallas Morning News, the LA Times, whatever.
[01:26:49.062 --> 01:26:49.162]  Yeah.
[01:27:07.688 --> 01:27:21.333]  But also just about the nature of the New World Order and his awakening, and Daryl saying that Christians need to stop being phony Christians and not fighting tyranny, and then just saying God's going to handle it all when God tells us to go out and take action against evil.
[01:27:21.373 --> 01:27:32.117]  And I always butcher his story, his parable of the eyes being the wind of the soul, so maybe he'll also tell that in its proper form the way he told it to me.
[01:27:32.477 --> 01:27:34.558]  Daryl, it's good to have you here with us on the air.
[01:27:35.655 --> 01:27:36.256]  Oh hey, Alex.
[01:27:36.316 --> 01:27:37.697]  It's my privilege and honor, man.
[01:27:37.757 --> 01:27:48.909]  I thank God for you, and I know I speak for millions of people out there who never get the opportunity to tell you, you know, face-to-face or call-to-call, that man, we truly do thank God for you and what you're doing.
[01:27:48.949 --> 01:27:57.058]  We know it's not easy, and man, you'd like your previous caller had online there said, I'm sure you don't leave it at the office.
[01:27:57.118 --> 01:27:58.239]  I'm sure your wife
[01:27:58.789 --> 01:27:59.930]  What business is that Darrell?
[01:28:18.965 --> 01:28:20.106]  I'm glad you asked, Alex.
[01:28:20.326 --> 01:28:23.027]  Hey, I'm going to go into the demolition business.
[01:28:23.187 --> 01:28:31.731]  Since it was so easy for those buildings on 9-11 to come down in free-fall speed just due to fires, I decided I'm going to start my own demolition company.
[01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:34.352]  Instead of using explosives, I'll save millions.
[01:28:34.412 --> 01:28:40.755]  I'll just knock a couple holes in the side of the building, light it on fire, and man, within an hour, the building will come down and I'll make millions.
[01:28:41.886 --> 01:28:43.047]  No, that's a great system.
[01:28:43.107 --> 01:28:44.067]  I think we ought to do that.
[01:28:44.988 --> 01:28:45.948]  Well, it worked so good on 9-11, right?
[01:28:45.968 --> 01:28:48.189]  That's what the government would have us believe.
[01:28:48.469 --> 01:28:51.151]  So, you know, we might as well just go in the demolition business together.
[01:28:51.171 --> 01:28:58.414]  We'll just go get a couple wrecking balls and knock a couple holes in the side of the building, pour a bunch of kerosene inside, set it on fire, kick back, roast marshmallows and make our money.
[01:28:59.555 --> 01:29:02.796]  I know, it's revolutionizing the demolition business.
[01:29:02.836 --> 01:29:07.739]  All you need is a BIC lighter and knock out a few windows and it magically happens.
[01:29:07.799 --> 01:29:10.240]  Now, Darrell, before we run out of time,
[01:29:12.287 --> 01:29:14.047]  We were having dinner one time down here in Austin.
[01:29:14.067 --> 01:29:32.472]  You're up in Dallas, back and forth from Dallas to Hawaii with your businesses, but you were giving me the parable of... We were talking about people that sell out to the New World Order, and you gave the analogy of somebody selling their eyes.
[01:29:33.432 --> 01:29:35.093]  Well, let me explain that.
[01:29:35.153 --> 01:29:40.414]  In fact, let me take it a step back just one second, because I know there's so much to talk about in so little time.
[01:29:41.215 --> 01:29:47.821]  You know, I believe, like the Colonel believed and spoke of yesterday, this isn't just a battle of flesh and blood against the New World Order.
[01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:49.023]  It's also a battle for souls.
[01:29:49.043 --> 01:29:57.010]  So I became a Christian about six years ago, not by choice, but because of the evidence, you know, that supported the Bible and prophecy, history, archaeology.
[01:29:57.050 --> 01:29:57.331]  And now,
[01:29:57.891 --> 01:30:16.605]  When you wake up to that, and you realize there is a God, He has a Son, He is our Savior, He died on the cross for our sins, and so on, you come to realize what Jesus said in the most popular speech of all time, in the Sermon on the Mount, that if you're not the one who can kill the body, and after that do no more, you're the one who can not only kill the body, but after that have your whole soul cast into hell.
[01:30:17.126 --> 01:30:23.731]  So we know that all the puppets, all the elite, all those people in power that are really perpetuating this on the people,
[01:30:24.514 --> 01:30:25.935]  Their headmaster is Satan.
[01:30:26.235 --> 01:30:30.657]  There was a guy named Lester Crowley years and years and years ago who wrote the Book of the Law.
[01:30:30.757 --> 01:30:35.279]  And it's a book still used by satanic worshippers today for their rituals and their rites.
[01:30:35.339 --> 01:30:36.779]  And it's only one law.
[01:30:37.339 --> 01:30:38.520]  That is, do what thou will.
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.640]  Do whatever you want to do.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:40.261]  Do it your way.
[01:30:40.281 --> 01:30:40.921]  Have it your way.
[01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:43.172]  And American people have really fed into that.
[01:30:43.192 --> 01:30:45.095]  I mean, we're the biggest consumers on this planet.
[01:30:45.135 --> 01:30:47.218]  We buy into that covetous nature.
[01:30:47.278 --> 01:30:50.323]  And so, really, what Satan wants is your soul.
[01:30:50.603 --> 01:30:52.786]  This isn't a battle to see who's going to win or lose in the end.
[01:30:52.826 --> 01:30:53.748]  We know there is a God.
[01:30:53.768 --> 01:30:55.330]  You're going to have to give an account on that day.
[01:30:55.751 --> 01:30:57.513]  Without the righteousness of Christ, you'll perish.
[01:30:58.414 --> 01:31:01.556]  In order to help people understand the value of what we're dealing with here.
[01:31:01.936 --> 01:31:12.063]  And if you truly, even if you're not a Christian, even if you're an atheist, I've never met an unreasonable person who doesn't at least believe in the golden rule that you ought to treat others the way you'd want to be treated.
[01:31:12.103 --> 01:31:15.325]  And the government is lining people up to be ready.
[01:31:15.385 --> 01:31:18.367]  I'm no prophet, but I'm going to tell you exactly how it's going to go down.
[01:31:19.388 --> 01:31:24.171]  When they collapse this financial, you know, whole market, what they're going to do is they're going to say, hey Alex, we know
[01:31:24.835 --> 01:31:31.197]  You know, you had $100,000 in the bank, and we're sorry that we can't give you your money, but I tell you what, we're going to this global system.
[01:31:31.357 --> 01:31:32.438]  It's a new global world.
[01:31:32.498 --> 01:31:33.318]  It's a new world order.
[01:31:33.338 --> 01:31:34.339]  It's a global economy.
[01:31:35.059 --> 01:31:41.621]  In order to get your $100,000 global credit, you need to take this chip so that you can get plugged into the system.
[01:31:42.241 --> 01:31:51.885]  But at that point in time, it's going to be, hey, you can take the chip and get your money and get your goods and be part of the system, or you can basically take the market to the east and end up going to hell.
[01:31:52.699 --> 01:31:54.119]  So, I mean, really, that's what we're faced with.
[01:31:54.179 --> 01:31:58.880]  And the fact of the matter is, I've yet to meet a sane person who would trade their eyes for a million bucks.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:31:59.781]  Ten million.
[01:31:59.801 --> 01:32:00.821]  A hundred million dollars.
[01:32:00.841 --> 01:32:01.681]  I ask people all the time.
[01:32:01.721 --> 01:32:07.762]  In fact, I'll challenge anybody that's in their right mind to call in and say, hey, I'll take Darryl up on the offer.
[01:32:07.782 --> 01:32:08.322]  A million bucks.
[01:32:08.362 --> 01:32:09.703]  I'll trade both my eyes.
[01:32:10.323 --> 01:32:10.903]  They'll go down.
[01:32:10.923 --> 01:32:11.683]  We'll have surgery.
[01:32:11.723 --> 01:32:12.563]  They'll take their eyes out.
[01:32:12.883 --> 01:32:14.684]  They'll have a million dollars, but they'll be blind.
[01:32:15.224 --> 01:32:16.004]  Nobody would do that.
[01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:16.384]  Why?
[01:32:16.824 --> 01:32:17.744]  Your eyes are valuable.
[01:32:17.764 --> 01:32:18.364]  They're precious.
[01:32:18.785 --> 01:32:18.965]  Right?
[01:32:18.985 --> 01:32:19.845]  They're irreplaceable.
[01:32:21.152 --> 01:32:25.434]  If they're merely the windows for your soul to look out of, how much more is the soul worth?
[01:32:26.114 --> 01:32:38.940]  So, you can't put a price tag on somebody's soul, and that's really what woke me up, and I guess you could call today my turnout party, Alex, because, like you and many others, when you first wake up, you go, well, I get it, I need to do something, what can I do about it?
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.842]  And we all know there's a new world order, we know about the Illuminati, we know about corrupt politicians and other puppets, you know?
[01:32:45.402 --> 01:32:46.823]  The question is, what are we going to do about it?
[01:32:47.509 --> 01:32:48.430]  I'm not about problems.
[01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:50.771]  I didn't succeed in business because I focused on the problem.
[01:32:51.131 --> 01:32:52.072]  I focused on solutions.
[01:32:52.632 --> 01:32:57.395]  And that's why I approached you, because I thought, well, we need to do something to help equip these people.
[01:32:57.975 --> 01:33:02.738]  If you push a soldier into battle armed with a feather duster, they're not going to be very courageous.
[01:33:03.339 --> 01:33:14.286]  But if you arm them with state-of-the-art weapons and you give them great training on how to use those weapons, not figuratively, I'm talking figuratively, not literally, then they can battle and do it courageously.
[01:33:15.373 --> 01:33:17.053]  Man, this isn't just a battle for souls.
[01:33:17.473 --> 01:33:21.594]  You know, I wouldn't, in fact, when I witnessed Alex, I don't just walk up to him and say, hey, you know, Jesus loves you.
[01:33:22.194 --> 01:33:23.135]  Jesus didn't do that.
[01:33:23.695 --> 01:33:26.195]  You start in the natural, and then you work to the spiritual.
[01:33:26.235 --> 01:33:31.136]  And one great springboard is what's going on in the world economy today, what's going on with our government today.
[01:33:31.156 --> 01:33:37.698]  I mean, one great segue question you can always ask somebody is, hey, are you happy with the way the government's, you know, serving you today?
[01:33:39.758 --> 01:33:44.399]  And of course, what, nine out of ten are going to say, no, man, they suck, they're horrible, they're terrible, and say, yeah, well, do you know why?
[01:33:44.901 --> 01:33:46.663]  And he can open up that door of conversation.
[01:33:47.143 --> 01:33:52.609]  Absolutely, because you know, talking, I mean, even the way I approach people on the street, you know, the way 9-11 truthers do, we are changed.
[01:33:52.649 --> 01:33:53.570]  Not all of them, but some.
[01:33:54.605 --> 01:33:58.847]  You know, we approach it a lot of times, yelling, screaming, aggressively.
[01:33:59.207 --> 01:34:05.030]  You know all the, I don't want to call them tricks, just systems to really get people to stop and think.
[01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.831]  And I've seen you.
[01:34:05.851 --> 01:34:07.892]  I mean, you really are a top flight salesman.
[01:34:07.912 --> 01:34:12.654]  That's why you're so successful and have a hundred million dollar company or more.
[01:34:12.994 --> 01:34:19.417]  I mean, explain to people some of the little tactics you use versus what people that aren't thinking about how to wake people up.
[01:34:20.658 --> 01:34:21.458]  I mean, compare those two.
[01:34:21.478 --> 01:34:23.879]  Well, it all starts with this, Alex, as we talked about.
[01:34:24.019 --> 01:34:32.660]  Our motive when we witness, okay, or when you go to just wake people up about the truth of the New World Order, can never be any more or any less than love.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.401]  It always has to be found in love.
[01:34:34.461 --> 01:34:34.661]  Why?
[01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:40.622]  Because if you do it just to win an argument or because you think they ought to know or whatever, your job isn't to wake them up.
[01:34:40.902 --> 01:34:46.803]  Your job is to give them good, strong, factual information and to do it with love and gentleness and respect and patience.
[01:34:47.267 --> 01:34:48.688]  And if you do that, then it's up to them.
[01:34:48.948 --> 01:34:51.529]  You give them the information, it's up to them if they receive it.
[01:34:52.049 --> 01:35:13.737]  That's why, you know, I speak out today to all the Christians who call themselves Christians, because every true blue Bible-believing Christian that I know, that I've talked to, and I've traveled the world, and I've worked with major ministries, many of which you know and see on TV, and I tell you the truth, they all sense in their spirit that we're living in the last days, which means that there's an imminent return of Christ that's going to happen, okay?
[01:35:14.017 --> 01:35:15.378]  And yet, when you talk to them about
[01:35:15.894 --> 01:35:20.376]  How the stage is being set, how biblical processes are being unfulfilled, right?
[01:35:20.396 --> 01:35:22.737]  Well, let me say this.
[01:35:22.797 --> 01:35:27.579]  They think, oh, that Alex Jones, that guy, that cretin from Planet Pop-Tart, you know?
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:37.804]  They don't connect, and it's a shame, because if they truly believe what the Bible says, and that this is a battle for souls, there is a Satan, he is the ruler of this world,
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:43.005]  Then they ought to, at least if they loved anybody, family, friends, strangers even.
[01:35:43.385 --> 01:35:46.428]  If they loved people the way Jesus loved people, they'd be warning them.
[01:35:46.648 --> 01:35:47.469]  They'd be talking to them.
[01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:49.451]  So love is our motive.
[01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:49.671]  Why?
[01:35:49.691 --> 01:35:51.393]  Because perfect love casts out all fear.
[01:35:51.533 --> 01:35:57.439]  I know from my own personal experience, I'm always afraid and why I was reluctant to come on your show initially and so on.
[01:35:58.177 --> 01:35:59.037]  Is what will people think?
[01:35:59.458 --> 01:36:00.298]  What will people say?
[01:36:00.718 --> 01:36:01.559]  What will people do?
[01:36:01.699 --> 01:36:02.299]  What will I say?
[01:36:02.519 --> 01:36:05.040]  You know, I don't know what to say, or it's just too difficult.
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.041]  They'll think I've flipped out.
[01:36:06.181 --> 01:36:11.243]  Well, let me just back up for a minute, and I may interrupt you in the time we have, Darryl, and we'll have you back up, because I asked you to come on months ago.
[01:36:11.263 --> 01:36:15.626]  I said you ought to do a radio show, as everybody else has told you, but you haven't done it, but you should do one.
[01:36:15.646 --> 01:36:19.427]  I know you're a very busy guy, because you're extremely articulate and really make your points well.
[01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:24.110]  Speaking of Bible prophecy, I don't mean the phony churches, folks, and all the stuff we see,
[01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:28.971]  We don't want those telemarketers saying, give me a thousand, God will give you ten.
[01:36:29.031 --> 01:36:29.831]  Sure, sure, sure.
[01:36:29.851 --> 01:36:36.633]  What we're talking about is, why did the world government, why is the UN setting up ten kingdoms?
[01:36:36.693 --> 01:36:38.393]  They call it ten kingdoms.
[01:36:38.813 --> 01:36:42.234]  Why do they use terminology that's all about Lucifer and world government?
[01:36:42.554 --> 01:36:44.514]  Why are they pushing that we take chips?
[01:36:45.534 --> 01:36:47.875]  Why are they setting up that exact system?
[01:36:47.915 --> 01:36:48.195]  Go ahead.
[01:36:49.022 --> 01:36:53.524]  Well, exactly, because just like Aleister Crowley taught... Keep in mind, this wasn't a guy who didn't believe in God.
[01:36:53.564 --> 01:36:54.324]  He wasn't an atheist.
[01:36:54.364 --> 01:36:56.025]  He was called the evilest man of his day.
[01:36:56.465 --> 01:36:57.245]  He was a pedophile.
[01:36:57.265 --> 01:36:57.845]  He was wicked.
[01:36:58.165 --> 01:37:04.868]  He was responsible for the biggest rebellion and devil worship kind of music and stuff that we've seen in our modern-day generation, okay?
[01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:09.970]  He said, hey, I don't have a problem with the Plymouth Brethren, referring to Christians.
[01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:13.531]  He said, I can't imagine a society who didn't believe in God or Jesus.
[01:37:14.091 --> 01:37:15.872]  I just chose to serve the other side.
[01:37:16.269 --> 01:37:18.130]  He wasn't content just to serve Satan.
[01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:21.511]  He said he wanted to be his chiefless staff, and that's where these guys are.
[01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:28.352]  Look, Satan holds the keys to Earth, and the power and the wealth, you know, because God's not into material stuff, okay?
[01:37:28.613 --> 01:37:30.193]  He doesn't even like religion.
[01:37:30.593 --> 01:37:31.673]  He likes relationships.
[01:37:32.114 --> 01:37:34.154]  So the bottom line is, these guys do this.
[01:37:34.234 --> 01:37:36.055]  I mean, that's just one in many prophecies.
[01:37:36.075 --> 01:37:36.915]  I mean, you can go to Daniel 12,
[01:37:37.595 --> 01:37:40.258]  Where Daniel said, in the last days, knowledge will be increased greatly.
[01:37:40.278 --> 01:37:41.279]  I mean, think about it.
[01:37:41.439 --> 01:37:43.962]  How fast could we travel back in Jesus' day?
[01:37:44.503 --> 01:37:44.923]  By horse.
[01:37:45.284 --> 01:37:48.247]  In George Washington's day, a couple thousand years later, by horse.
[01:37:48.607 --> 01:37:56.516]  No improvement in technology, but in our lifetime, we've seen the internet, we've seen radio, we've seen car assembly, spaceships, satellites, you name it.
[01:37:57.259 --> 01:38:01.021]  No, there's thousands of biblical prophecies that are being unfolded right before our eyes.
[01:38:01.061 --> 01:38:03.962]  And it's said people will run to and fro continually.
[01:38:04.282 --> 01:38:06.043]  Look at the highways and roads.
[01:38:07.024 --> 01:38:12.466]  And in particular, as far as, you know, I wanted to bring this up today, it's real important, false flag terrorism.
[01:38:12.827 --> 01:38:14.387]  Well, there's a biblical precedent for that.
[01:38:14.747 --> 01:38:21.951]  And Christians ought to wake up to that reality that 9-1-1 is and could be an inside job, very likely is an inside job.
[01:38:22.211 --> 01:38:22.471]  Why?
[01:38:22.571 --> 01:38:24.212]  Nero did the same thing to the Christians.
[01:38:24.949 --> 01:38:27.730]  He set his own city on fire and then he fiddled all night.
[01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:28.290]  And what did he do?
[01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:29.751]  He blamed the Christians.
[01:38:30.451 --> 01:38:38.593]  So Christians ought to be, in particular, aware of what's going on and how likely it is for a government to do a self-inflicted wound in order to blame another party.
[01:38:39.634 --> 01:38:46.956]  In fact, and I wanted to bring this up because nobody brought this up on your show and I thought it was very intriguing, went over almost, that I've met, American Peds.
[01:38:47.496 --> 01:38:53.518]  In the very first debate between Obama and McCain, they asked McCain, I think it was the second question the moderator asked,
[01:38:53.979 --> 01:38:56.662]  Are we safer today than we were a day after 9-11?
[01:38:57.122 --> 01:38:58.784]  He gave a very precarious answer.
[01:38:58.984 --> 01:39:00.485]  Go look it up on YouTube, it's there.
[01:39:00.926 --> 01:39:12.837]  He says, and I quote, Joe Lieberman and I started the 9-11 Commission, and we were stymied and stifled by the administration, and it wasn't until the families came forward that an investigation took place.
[01:39:13.498 --> 01:39:14.439]  Now, unquote.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.481]  Now that begs the question, why?
[01:39:17.105 --> 01:39:29.999]  Why would, I mean this isn't some conspiracy theory, this isn't Alex Jones, this isn't some buddy who doesn't know what they're talking about, this is potentially at that time the next president of the United States acknowledging that the Bush administration did not want to investigate 9-11.
[01:39:30.539 --> 01:39:30.800]  Why?
[01:39:31.621 --> 01:39:35.304]  Why wouldn't you investigate the biggest, most horrific terrorist attack in the history of the world?
[01:39:35.965 --> 01:39:36.706]  There's got to be a reason.
[01:39:37.392 --> 01:39:38.594]  That they would uncover something?
[01:39:38.734 --> 01:39:39.315]  Of course they would.
[01:39:39.355 --> 01:39:40.276]  Why would they fight?
[01:39:40.416 --> 01:39:43.099]  Why would they fight to cover everything up?
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:45.643]  Why would they be so secretive with the steel?
[01:39:45.943 --> 01:39:54.093]  Why would they take the three black boxes they did find, of the four that were in the planes and at the towers, and firefighters found them and they took them?
[01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:56.892]  You guys have been talking about that for years now.
[01:39:57.072 --> 01:39:57.773]  You predicted it.
[01:39:58.033 --> 01:39:59.094]  You said it was going to happen.
[01:39:59.514 --> 01:40:00.535]  And a lot of people don't believe it.
[01:40:00.555 --> 01:40:01.195]  They don't buy it.
[01:40:01.416 --> 01:40:02.316]  They think it's a lie.
[01:40:02.576 --> 01:40:06.819]  They'd rather believe the official story that the government feeds them and then buy that propaganda.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:09.601]  But frankly, you know what?
[01:40:09.661 --> 01:40:12.043]  I wanted to read something to you today, and I don't know if we have time.
[01:40:12.083 --> 01:40:12.423]  Go ahead.
[01:40:12.443 --> 01:40:14.405]  I would just encourage the listeners to go.
[01:40:14.745 --> 01:40:22.771]  Here's a little bit of prophecy and some words of encouragement for you in particular, Alex, because we know you're the point of spear of this whole movement.
[01:40:23.652 --> 01:40:24.252]  But listen to this.
[01:40:24.273 --> 01:40:25.974]  This is 2 Timothy chapter 3 and 4.
[01:40:26.114 --> 01:40:29.496]  It says, Mark this, there'll be terrible times in the last days.
[01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:32.419]  People, now see if this sounds like our generation, okay?
[01:40:32.979 --> 01:40:43.947]  People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous.
[01:40:43.987 --> 01:40:45.569]  Man, you deal with that every day on your show.
[01:40:46.509 --> 01:40:48.311]  Without self-control, brutal.
[01:40:48.611 --> 01:40:51.393]  Think about the brutality of the crimes we see against children today.
[01:40:51.952 --> 01:40:52.952]  Not lovers of the good.
[01:40:53.013 --> 01:40:54.713]  See, people today don't even care about good.
[01:40:54.773 --> 01:40:56.274]  All they care about is moving up, right?
[01:40:56.294 --> 01:40:57.334]  They don't care who's back.
[01:40:57.354 --> 01:40:59.095]  They gotta stab to move up the corporate ladder.
[01:40:59.375 --> 01:41:00.216]  They do it all the time.
[01:41:00.816 --> 01:41:04.638]  They're treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
[01:41:05.078 --> 01:41:07.419]  They have a form of godliness, but they deny its power.
[01:41:07.559 --> 01:41:08.899]  It says, have nothing to do with them.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:16.903]  They're the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women who are loaded down with all kinds of sins and swayed by all kinds of evil desires.
[01:41:17.983 --> 01:41:21.325]  Also learning, but now this is an interesting, it fits our generation as well,
[01:41:22.128 --> 01:41:25.372]  Also, forever learning, but unable to acknowledge the truth.
[01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:26.773]  We live in the information age.
[01:41:26.793 --> 01:41:37.866]  People are learning faster than... Yeah, they have all the info to prove it to them, but they don't... they still deny it, as every newspaper announces, world government's born, oven by the banks, and they say, nope, doesn't exist!
[01:41:39.127 --> 01:41:40.549]  Well, and that's what's interesting.
[01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:41.149]  Listen to this.
[01:41:41.169 --> 01:41:42.491]  This is starting chapter four.
[01:41:43.402 --> 01:41:47.084]  This is, keep in mind, this is Apostle Paul's last book of the Bible that he wrote.
[01:41:47.505 --> 01:41:49.446]  He's in prison, he's waiting to be executed.
[01:41:49.826 --> 01:41:51.727]  He's writing this to his disciple Timothy.
[01:41:51.747 --> 01:41:53.988]  It's kind of like his last will and testament.
[01:41:54.529 --> 01:42:02.994]  He says, "...in the presence of God, in the view of Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead, and in the view of his appearing in his kingdom, I give you this charge.
[01:42:03.634 --> 01:42:04.415]  Preach the word.
[01:42:04.815 --> 01:42:06.936]  Be prepared in season and out of season.
[01:42:07.056 --> 01:42:11.339]  Correct, rebuke, and encourage with great patience and careful instruction."
[01:42:11.806 --> 01:42:15.448]  For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine or truth.
[01:42:15.948 --> 01:42:21.690]  Instead, to suit their own desires, they'll gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
[01:42:22.291 --> 01:42:24.992]  They'll turn aside to myth and fairy tales.
[01:42:25.512 --> 01:42:30.654]  But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, and do the work of an evangelist.
[01:42:30.955 --> 01:42:32.735]  Discharge the full duties of your ministry.
[01:42:32.755 --> 01:42:36.197]  In other words, look, there's nothing more important any of us can do who are believers
[01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:41.761]  Then to use this information to wake people up to a reason, to the knowledge of the truth that their soul may be saved.
[01:42:42.602 --> 01:42:43.363]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:48.988]  If you love somebody, if you care about somebody, I'm walking down the street and I see a stranger's house on fire and I don't even know the guy.
[01:42:49.488 --> 01:42:51.370]  And I have the opportunity to go in there and get him out.
[01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:54.112]  I'm under a moral obligation to do that.
[01:42:54.292 --> 01:42:55.013]  Daryl, you are.
[01:42:55.133 --> 01:43:01.879]  Final segment straight ahead, but for the InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.tv listeners and viewers, we're going to talk right now.
[01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:03.881]  It is a big... Daryl?
[01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:07.631]  Yeah, so the bottom line is simply this.
[01:43:07.731 --> 01:43:18.236]  Look, if we love people, we're going to pursue, with all passion, waking these people up, talking to them, sharing with them, caring enough to share this information.
[01:43:18.796 --> 01:43:22.557]  You don't get rejected, don't get sad when they reject you, okay?
[01:43:22.577 --> 01:43:25.599]  Because the power's not in the messenger, it's in the message.
[01:43:26.239 --> 01:43:30.821]  What you've got to do is be a faithful farmer, just sow those seeds of information to people, and then
[01:43:31.573 --> 01:43:32.614]  People respond or they don't.
[01:43:32.814 --> 01:43:40.539]  And when we come back from the break, I definitely want to share, to answer your question Alex, four simple steps to help anybody effectively communicate their message.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:42.641]  Alright, we'll do that.
[01:43:42.701 --> 01:43:45.282]  But you know, speaking to folks that
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:47.721]  You know, they love the lie.
[01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:49.763]  They do it because they're scared at the end of the day.
[01:43:49.783 --> 01:44:01.035]  And I think the key is to explain to them they should be more concerned about not, while they're alive this one time, doing the right thing and helping others.
[01:44:01.696 --> 01:44:04.158]  And that they're unhappy because they love worldliness.
[01:44:04.198 --> 01:44:05.399]  Not that I'm perfect here, folks.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:06.981]  And that they love the system.
[01:44:08.923 --> 01:44:19.137]  Of course they're not fulfilled, but as soon as they start loving good, then they'll start growing in the opposite direction, away from evil, towards good, and it'll get stronger and stronger.
[01:44:19.157 --> 01:44:20.699]  Go ahead.
[01:44:24.687 --> 01:44:25.087]  I don't know.
[01:44:40.925 --> 01:44:42.946]  Khan means with, science means knowledge.
[01:44:42.966 --> 01:44:43.687]  So, with knowledge.
[01:44:43.727 --> 01:44:46.288]  Every time you do something you shouldn't, you do it with knowledge.
[01:44:46.308 --> 01:44:53.132]  So, I don't think anybody really has the power to turn from that nature, that sin nature, until Christ comes and changes their heart.
[01:44:53.312 --> 01:45:03.799]  Because when God changes a person's heart, and that, to me, is the greatest testimony of all, that God is real, and Jesus is the Son of God, because only He has the power to save someone's soul and change a person's heart.
[01:45:04.139 --> 01:45:04.679]  Absolutely!
[01:45:04.699 --> 01:45:08.882]  You know, I wanted to... Darrell, I wanted to talk some about, you know, on air,
[01:45:09.986 --> 01:45:11.007]  You've got a great idea.
[01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:11.868]  I need to do it.
[01:45:11.968 --> 01:45:13.269]  People have asked me to do it.
[01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:21.055]  I'm just almost afraid of leading organizations because I don't like particularly being a leader.
[01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.758]  Also, the infiltrators.
[01:45:31.854 --> 01:45:32.635]  You have to deal with those?
[01:45:32.735 --> 01:45:35.458]  I mean, people come in this office and just make up anything after they leave.
[01:45:37.501 --> 01:45:49.414]  I totally appreciate where you're coming from and I understand your concerns completely, but just as those infiltrators within the CIA and any other organizations, you're never going to be able to weed those out, but it shouldn't stop you from the mission.
[01:45:50.796 --> 01:45:53.619]  No, I know.
[01:45:53.659 --> 01:45:54.680]  It's a very important mission.
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:55.861]  I'll have to have you up next week.
[01:46:08.624 --> 01:46:11.527]  I hope that people out there listening will go check out PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:46:11.627 --> 01:46:16.671]  We've got a deal for five-plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:46:16.711 --> 01:46:18.693]  And it's a factory, an armory of resistance.
[01:46:19.093 --> 01:46:27.860]  Download, burn all my films, TV reports, special reports, thousands of them, to disk on every issue, subject you can imagine, and give them to people.
[01:46:27.940 --> 01:46:31.483]  You know all about what's happening, but your neighbors, your friends, your family don't.
[01:46:31.824 --> 01:46:35.226]  And right now, they're more open to the truth than they've ever been.
[01:46:36.184 --> 01:46:44.047]  So all of you out there who may have tried to wake people up ten years ago, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, a year ago, got laughed at, keep moving like Darrell Rundis said.
[01:46:44.067 --> 01:46:44.707]  Keep planting the seeds.
[01:46:44.947 --> 01:46:47.228]  Darrell, I've got to have you up sometime next week for a full hour.
[01:46:47.808 --> 01:46:51.029]  In fact, I'll just call you right after the show.
[01:46:51.249 --> 01:46:56.511]  And I know I procrastinated calling you back lately because I wanted to keep writing up a plan before I talk to you again.
[01:46:56.771 --> 01:46:58.072]  Then I would never get the plan done.
[01:46:58.092 --> 01:47:03.294]  So I'm glad you really called into the show yesterday to push us along because I know we need to form
[01:47:03.954 --> 01:47:04.395]  Okay, basically...
[01:47:23.192 --> 01:47:28.455]  What I'd like to do, Alex, and what we're talking about, just to fill in the gaps for the listeners, is to do an on-site training.
[01:47:28.836 --> 01:47:33.619]  Roll up your sleeves, get in the trenches, big-time battle against the New World Order.
[01:47:33.879 --> 01:47:40.723]  Get 50, 60, 100 people, take them on our wing, show them what's up, and those who qualify, send them home, let them become what we call a local leader.
[01:47:41.024 --> 01:47:42.144]  We can form an organization.
[01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:44.646]  In fact, I already incorporated the Truth News Network.
[01:47:45.106 --> 01:47:48.209]  So that they can all then continue to duplicate themselves.
[01:47:48.249 --> 01:47:49.670]  I mean, that's what we have to do.
[01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:50.631]  You can't do everything.
[01:47:50.752 --> 01:47:51.552]  I can't do everything.
[01:47:51.833 --> 01:47:52.853]  Individually, we're nothing.
[01:47:52.954 --> 01:47:57.678]  But the sum of the total parts are always greater than the individual parts.
[01:47:57.758 --> 01:48:01.181]  So, you know, the sum total is always greater and we need to facilitate that.
[01:48:01.201 --> 01:48:01.962]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:48:01.982 --> 01:48:09.209]  We just need to give people the tools they need to succeed and teach them and train them so that they'll be empowered to face their fears and fight back against the new world order.
[01:48:11.872 --> 01:48:18.881]  Well, it's a great idea and other folks have thought of simpler, I mean, other simple things that work that are along similar lines.
[01:48:19.041 --> 01:48:28.112]  And, Darrell, you've got a lot of great ideas and a lot of effective tactics to really reach out and really affect change with people out there.
[01:48:29.633 --> 01:48:33.476]  Soon enough, I guess we need to start planning and moving forward with trying to do this.
[01:48:33.696 --> 01:48:38.199]  I'm just trying to do a Barack Obama video, a JFK film, a Eugenics film.
[01:48:38.559 --> 01:48:40.381]  I'm trying to finish my little TV studio.
[01:48:40.441 --> 01:48:43.883]  My radio studio is going to be a lot better with a bunch of cameras and robotic cameras.
[01:48:59.073 --> 01:49:04.535]  We'll work that out, but I'd love to bring people down to Austin or Dallas, like you're going to be up to Dallas here in another couple of weeks.
[01:49:04.996 --> 01:49:09.618]  Maybe we can do a little mini-event there at the Fed, and we can kind of work out the bugs from there.
[01:49:09.658 --> 01:49:15.280]  But in the meantime, I do want to offer everybody, with this show you're running, to get new subscribers.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.941]  I'll pay for the first 100 that call today, okay?
[01:49:18.361 --> 01:49:22.083]  You just tell all the listeners, first 100 people that call in, the bill's on me.
[01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:27.694]  Now, I mean, how am I going to get a prison... I mean, how will I do that prisonplanet.tv subscriber?
[01:49:29.155 --> 01:49:31.738]  Well, I mean, if they're calling in and they're not a current subscriber, they sign up.
[01:49:32.618 --> 01:49:33.179]  Make them pay.
[01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:33.799]  Give me their name.
[01:49:33.819 --> 01:49:35.441]  I'll send them a check or something.
[01:49:35.521 --> 01:49:36.121]  We'll work it out.
[01:49:36.141 --> 01:49:38.984]  But up to the first 100 that subscribe, pay.
[01:49:39.524 --> 01:49:40.665]  Well, Daryl's a great guy.
[01:49:40.685 --> 01:49:44.749]  I mean, Daryl's really tried to help us and tried to, you know, donate money and stuff.
[01:49:44.769 --> 01:49:48.953]  And I refuse most of it because, I mean, I just want to be able to spend it on something.
[01:49:48.993 --> 01:49:50.073]  In fact, a lot of that money for those
[01:49:50.714 --> 01:49:55.941]  Don't worry about the money in closing.
[01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:58.925]  Just look at it like this.
[01:49:58.986 --> 01:50:01.890]  When Lindsey Williams said oil was going to 50, I told it short.
[01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:02.591]  I made a fortune.
[01:50:02.631 --> 01:50:03.412]  So don't worry about it.
[01:50:04.392 --> 01:50:06.154]  Oh, so you, well that's great, that's good.
[01:50:06.494 --> 01:50:09.436]  Well, I mean, what's the odds of the guys getting that right two or three times?
[01:50:09.476 --> 01:50:13.940]  I mean, obviously, Lindsey Williams, you, many other people, what they say is true.
[01:50:14.141 --> 01:50:25.911]  Darryl, what I'm going to do is, the first hundred people that email Aaron at InfoWars.com, only the first hundred, I will give them a hundred free year subscriptions.
[01:50:25.951 --> 01:50:27.152]  You want a year subscription?
[01:50:28.274 --> 01:50:30.735]  Whatever you're offering, whatever your special is, I'll pay for that.
