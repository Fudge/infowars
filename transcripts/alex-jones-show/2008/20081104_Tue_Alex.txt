[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.473]  More on corruption.
[00:00:02.974 --> 00:00:05.739]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:21.123]  Max Keiser has been on with us for the last 35 minutes or so of air time.
[00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:21.924]  He's been with us for another 20.
[00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:24.365]  We're now going directly to your phone calls.
[00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:29.448]  We are also now live in the fourth hour of the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:33.671]  We're going to be taking your phone calls for the balance at the end of the show.
[00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:38.094]  Getting a quick pop-in from Dean Barkley running for Senate up in Minnesota.
[00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:41.836]  But we'll be taking your calls continually for the rest of this hour.
[00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:46.459]  We were just talking about what's going to happen in this country, what the private bankers have done to us.
[00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:48.299]  With Max Keiser.
[00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:53.700]  And of course, Max Keiser is an international TV presenter on Al Jazeera, radio host, entrepreneur.
[00:00:54.501 --> 00:01:02.962]  He also, again, is the inventor of quite a few different market technologies, like the virtual specialist technology prediction markets.
[00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:07.644]  And he, of course, has been a stockbroker as well, top stockbroker.
[00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:09.144]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:10.184]  These will be all over the map.
[00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:10.984]  Appreciate you holding.
[00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:13.785]  Francis in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:14.205]  Go ahead.
[00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:17.788]  Yeah, hi Alex, this is Fran Schur from Denver.
[00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:20.910]  I'm one of the founders of Colorado 9-11 Visibility.
[00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:28.877]  I have more information on our 9-11 truth friend, Sean Fitzgerald, who's in a hospital in Thailand.
[00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:31.939]  I need to let you know because this is a matter of life or death for him.
[00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.521]  Okay, his dad called an earlier hour.
[00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.702]  Yeah, his dad called you.
[00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:40.006]  I've got more information about it, about what happened and how we can help him.
[00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:41.807]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.089]  First of all, he and his wife are working
[00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:45.391]  In Thailand.
[00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:49.433]  And he's been very outspoken about 9-11 truth.
[00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:59.356]  He found himself then being followed by Thai military, and last night he had an automobile accident, which was very questionable.
[00:01:59.456 --> 00:02:02.037]  Yeah, we've been emailed the story, so how do we help him in the hospital?
[00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:03.778]  I mean, what's happening to him?
[00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:05.138]  Mae Sot Hospital.
[00:02:05.298 --> 00:02:07.859]  M-A-E-S-O-T Hospital.
[00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:08.660]  That's two words.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.220]  Mae Sot.
[00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:17.834]  And he is now also, he's being, military police are coming in and observing him in the hospital.
[00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:19.294]  He's very scared for his life.
[00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:25.137]  How you can help him is to fax or call the Maysoth Hospital.
[00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.958]  And that's very easy to look up online.
[00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:28.978]  Or you can call me.
[00:02:29.058 --> 00:02:30.479]  I can give you my telephone number.
[00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:31.519]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:32.920]  I mean, I think people should call the U.S.
[00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.800]  Embassy, but go ahead.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.900]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.621]  Has anybody done that?
[00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:36.301]  You can call the U.S.
[00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:37.141]  State Department.
[00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:39.022]  That's also very easy to find online.
[00:02:40.197 --> 00:02:42.340]  Uh, but call me, can I give my telephone number?
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.740]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.105]  You all can, and Alex, your staff can call me, and I can help you with this too.
[00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:51.890]  I mean, I don't even know if he's in a car wreck at the hospital, but we'll see if something's happening.
[00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.270]  Go ahead.
[00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:56.235]  My number, so you can call me, Alex, your staff, or anyone else, 303-778-7511.
[00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:01.707]  303-778-7511.
[00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:06.809]  Okay, I'm going to track this and watch this and see if there's an issue there.
[00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.571]  I've talked to his dad, and we've got emails from him.
[00:03:09.951 --> 00:03:14.893]  Our car wreck, and I mean, Thailand's a total police state, so I wouldn't live there, but we'll try to follow this.
[00:03:14.913 --> 00:03:16.034]  The State Department needs to be called.
[00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:18.335]  Okay, let's talk to Scott in Arizona.
[00:03:18.355 --> 00:03:19.135]  Scott, you're on the air.
[00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:19.575]  Go ahead.
[00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:21.656]  Hey, Alex.
[00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:22.737]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:29.280]  Yeah, I actually got a statement with regard to McCain and Obama.
[00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:36.310]  If McCain, if the oil, what your guess is saying is starting to shoot up, do you see it going back up?
[00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.115]  Because I remember the prediction of, I can't remember his name right now, saying the oil would go down to $50 a barrel.
[00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:47.138]  Lindsey Williams said three months ago it would go down to $60, and it has.
[00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:48.078]  And it did.
[00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:59.066]  It did, from $1.40 down to $60, and you're seeing it, he's saying it will go back up again, because McCain's probably not going to get it, but they also said McCain was their man.
[00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:00.872]  And I'm trying to figure it out.
[00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:11.299]  One side, McCain's got the oil companies supporting him, and Obama's got the bankers, but, you know, he's got Henry Kissinger backing him, which is ran by Rockefeller.
[00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.861]  And Rockefeller runs... They run both of them.
[00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:15.562]  Do you have a question for Max Keiser?
[00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:17.723]  Yeah.
[00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:19.684]  Basically, do you see that going up?
[00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:21.045]  Back up to where it was at?
[00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:22.326]  Yeah, so let's get that question.
[00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:24.568]  We're going to skip this break, too, with Max Keiser.
[00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:24.788]  Max?
[00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:32.057]  Yeah, the sea oil going up because the money supply is now starting to be jacked up.
[00:04:32.277 --> 00:04:37.678]  The oil, like we were saying before the break, is priced in dollars, just like all commodities in the world.
[00:04:38.338 --> 00:04:47.221]  And as the supply of dollars increases, oil price goes up as part of the inflation that comes with oil price going up.
[00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:54.823]  Now, with the devaluation coming, which will make the value of the dollar even more precarious, you're going to see oil even take another leap up.
[00:04:55.472 --> 00:04:59.555]  Well, a lot of analysts say back up to a hundred bucks a barrel by next summer.
[00:04:59.575 --> 00:05:01.957]  I'm going to skip this break to the internet audience with Max Keiser.
[00:05:02.277 --> 00:05:03.218]  Thanks for the call.
[00:05:03.718 --> 00:05:04.418]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:05.639]  I'm going to take more calls.
[00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:09.742]  Okay, let's talk to Jake in New York.
[00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:11.443]  You're on the air with Max Keiser.
[00:05:11.483 --> 00:05:12.124]  Go ahead, Jake.
[00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:16.867]  Jake?
[00:05:17.328 --> 00:05:17.568]  Yes?
[00:05:17.888 --> 00:05:18.789]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:19.910]  I'm on the air?
[00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.571]  Yes, we're going to have to let you go in a moment.
[00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:35.679]  My question for you about Barack Obama is his links to the Council on Foreign Relations and why that has not been brought to more light and why the police state continues to look like it looks like.
[00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.921]  Like in New York, where I live, we're having mobilization
[00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:49.168]  Mobilization units walking around, driving around... Yeah, any excuse to have riot police out, any excuse to sell us that we're slaves, any excuse to... They're videotaping us.
[00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:54.432]  They have vans with eight video cameras on them driving into crowded areas.
[00:05:54.892 --> 00:05:58.735]  Yeah, they're going to bankrupt America and take everything we've got, no matter who gets elected.
[00:05:58.775 --> 00:05:59.856]  These men are just puppets.
[00:06:00.196 --> 00:06:03.438]  And so this is the long, dark winter that America is going into.
[00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.041]  This is what we're getting because we were spoiled, rotten, and stupid and let tyranny grow.
[00:06:07.381 --> 00:06:07.982]  Max Keiser.
[00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:27.419]  Now I have a question, Max, is that everybody, I guess a lot of people that have been coming on the show have been talking about how great FDR was, and I wanted to know what your views on that were, being as that he abolished the gold standard and
[00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.671]  Yeah, some people... Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.051]  We're going to go ahead and let him comment now.
[00:06:32.731 --> 00:06:37.553]  Yeah, a lot of people are saying we need an FDR-style bailout instead of just paying everything directly to the bankers.
[00:06:37.813 --> 00:06:40.593]  But either way, it devalues the currency in the end, doesn't it, Max?
[00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:42.954]  Yeah, pretty much.
[00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:44.695]  The currency is going to suffer in the end.
[00:06:44.715 --> 00:06:53.497]  I mean, the FDR package, certainly putting money, bypassing the banking system, would have been probably a way to put it directly into the hands of people.
[00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:59.684]  As far as it relates to gold, because FDR, as the caller pointed out, suspended the sales of gold.
[00:06:59.904 --> 00:07:09.347]  We're going to see this type of thing where gold sales, this is why people need to really be aware of this whole gold situation, and if at all possible, get some gold outside of the U.S.
[00:07:09.487 --> 00:07:12.228]  That option is available with different services.
[00:07:12.608 --> 00:07:17.710]  If you do a little research, you can find services that allow you to buy gold and have it owned outside of the U.S.
[00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:28.784]  Because as the dollar devaluation program comes in, the possibility of confiscating gold will once again rear its ugly head, so you should have your gold and bullion outside of the U.S.
[00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:31.426]  Well, people always say, why should I hold gold?
[00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:32.127]  They can just take it.
[00:07:32.387 --> 00:07:36.290]  That's better than having it just be money in a bank that they're devaluing, or they can seize.
[00:07:38.857 --> 00:07:45.479]  Look, I mean, having gold bullion, it's a real issue.
[00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:46.899]  It's definitely a real issue.
[00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:51.581]  That's why there are services that allow you to own it outside of the U.S.
[00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:53.821]  And that really should be looked at.
[00:07:54.061 --> 00:07:55.762]  There are a couple of ways on the internet.
[00:07:56.062 --> 00:08:00.583]  You know, I'm not going to give a free advertisement, but there are a couple of services on the web.
[00:08:00.723 --> 00:08:01.663]  Well, there's more than a couple.
[00:08:01.703 --> 00:08:02.404]  There's thousands.
[00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:04.824]  You can keep it in Luxembourg or wherever.
[00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:06.505]  Okay, we're going back to the full audience.
[00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:06.865]  Here we go.
[00:08:08.897 --> 00:08:11.063]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:14.452]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:19.637]  International broadcaster, financial expert Max Keiser.
[00:08:19.657 --> 00:08:20.598]  We're taking your phone calls.
[00:08:20.618 --> 00:08:21.358]  They're all over the map.
[00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:21.878]  That's fine.
[00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:24.120]  That's what I expected.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:24.200]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.642]  Before the show ends, we'll give you the latest election numbers coming in from around the country.
[00:08:28.722 --> 00:08:31.504]  Obviously, looks very good for Barack Obama.
[00:08:32.384 --> 00:08:37.827]  But there are police all over the country treating the entire public like enemies.
[00:08:40.768 --> 00:08:46.471]  In case there was some type of rioting over the election, there are lots of other things happening.
[00:08:46.512 --> 00:08:54.036]  There are reports of Black Panthers, this is up on Drudge and Fox, so it's questionable, blocking white people from getting into polling places.
[00:08:54.516 --> 00:08:58.239]  But there is also such a worship of Barack Obama, who knows, it may even be true, they've got video.
[00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:03.986]  So lots of insanity going on as people fight over the two puppets.
[00:09:04.386 --> 00:09:16.636]  Max Keiser, I want to go back to the calls here in this final segment with you, but right now, your analysis, your take on how they were able to have physical gold dry up where you could hardly buy it, or if you could, it was a 30, 40, 50, 100% markup, that's mainstream news.
[00:09:19.218 --> 00:09:34.491]  How did these international institutions create a system, we know they can play and manipulate markets, but to have it where gold's dropping 200 bucks an ounce, or 250 bucks an ounce, now going back up, dropping while you physically can't get it and demands at all-time highs, how do they do that?
[00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:37.174]  Well, it's a paper market, Alex.
[00:09:37.474 --> 00:09:40.957]  I mean, gold is traded on the COMEX as a features contract.
[00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.199]  The people who buy and sell it are not taking physical delivery.
[00:09:43.823 --> 00:09:51.865]  And just like they can make the price of anything else on these paper markets go in any direction they want to, they can make the price of gold go down if they want the price of gold.
[00:09:51.905 --> 00:09:53.826]  They sell gold contracts short.
[00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.046]  They sell contracts short.
[00:09:56.427 --> 00:09:58.507]  And when you sell something, the price goes down.
[00:09:58.787 --> 00:10:00.288]  And here's the incredible thing.
[00:10:00.508 --> 00:10:04.949]  They have sold more contracts short than the COMEX has any hope of ever delivering.
[00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:13.078]  And this December, from what I'm hearing, is that there's going to be a crash of the COMEX because people are going to demand their physical delivery of the gold and silver.
[00:10:13.298 --> 00:10:15.579]  They will not be able to fulfill that transaction.
[00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:16.960]  They will not be able to deliver.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.123]  It'll be a failed delivery, and you're going to see huge dislocation, and the COMEX is being targeted.
[00:10:22.463 --> 00:10:24.244]  By people, you know, by investors.
[00:10:24.344 --> 00:10:29.325]  There's actually individual investors in the United States who are saying, who are staging a revolt against COMEX in the silver market.
[00:10:29.345 --> 00:10:31.886]  They're saying, we want physical delivery, and we're going down there.
[00:10:32.246 --> 00:10:33.046]  We want our gold!
[00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:40.488]  And it's also here in the international community, because the COMEX is destroying the reserves for mining and mining companies all over the world.
[00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:48.250]  In Russia, in Canada, you know, these mining companies are having to shut down because COMEX is driving the price down artificially.
[00:10:48.809 --> 00:10:50.630]  And now they're saying, what the hell with you?
[00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.091]  We're going to bust Comex!
[00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:58.294]  And then physical prices, the paper price is going to be destroyed, and you're going to see the true black market prices going to assert itself.
[00:10:58.594 --> 00:11:03.617]  Gold is trading in the black market at a lot higher prices, and that's going to be the market.
[00:11:03.777 --> 00:11:10.500]  Well, I know nobody can buy it at, you know, $7.50 or whatever, to then be able to sell it to people what they claim spot is.
[00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:13.662]  I mean, it's just... Absolutely, absolutely not!
[00:11:13.722 --> 00:11:15.343]  I mean, I can't get gold in Paris.
[00:11:15.703 --> 00:11:25.015]  I can't get gold bullion in Paris for less than $1,100-$1,200 an ounce down there at the gold bullion deal.
[00:11:26.097 --> 00:11:31.544]  If I go in there off the street, if I'm buying in size, obviously I can negotiate a better deal, but the spot price...
[00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:45.694]  But if you see today though, Alex, as the news is coming out of Washington now that they're going to have to refinance a half a trillion dollars worth of bad debts because of the bailout packages and because all the money went to the bankers and didn't go into the system, they've got to go back to the trough for another half a trillion.
[00:11:46.524 --> 00:11:57.613]  And with the rumor getting louder of a devaluation of the dollar, you see that gold and oil are saying, to hell with this, we're going higher, because there's going to be a lot of inflation coming through the pipeline.
[00:11:57.813 --> 00:12:01.676]  Gold and oil are going higher to reflect this.
[00:12:02.637 --> 00:12:05.579]  The primary story of inflation is very much in place.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.321]  People should not be fooled by it.
[00:12:07.921 --> 00:12:11.144]  Owning real assets is what's going to save you through this inflationary period.
[00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:13.645]  Don't believe the inflationary hype that's out there.
[00:12:14.665 --> 00:12:18.628]  The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, Time, they're talking about, oh, there's a deflation scare.
[00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:20.469]  It's impossible to have inflation here!
[00:12:46.206 --> 00:12:46.886]  Hello, Alex.
[00:12:47.006 --> 00:12:47.566]  Can you hear me?
[00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:48.507]  Yes, I sure can.
[00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:51.868]  Okay, I'm a first-time caller from New York, Staten Island.
[00:12:52.108 --> 00:12:52.428]  Welcome.
[00:12:52.468 --> 00:12:55.850]  And I was also a first-time registered Democrat.
[00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.550]  Okay.
[00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:04.593]  And my vote initially was for Obama, and I couldn't talk to you without voting.
[00:13:05.553 --> 00:13:07.114]  And that's my call to you, Alex.
[00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:09.335]  New York loves you over here.
[00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:10.175]  Well, we love you, too.
[00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:10.856]  We love everybody.
[00:13:11.536 --> 00:13:12.296]  What's on your mind?
[00:13:13.016 --> 00:13:14.357]  I want to know what should I do.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:16.781]  I don't know.
[00:13:24.383 --> 00:13:25.403]  For McCain, obviously.
[00:13:25.443 --> 00:13:25.703]  I'm sorry.
[00:13:25.723 --> 00:13:27.384]  I'm just so passionate.
[00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:28.844]  Well, we're in the same boat.
[00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:30.784]  It's a moral decision.
[00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:33.004]  People are told to vote like a horse race.
[00:13:33.044 --> 00:13:34.565]  Who do they think is going to win the race?
[00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:43.026]  Bandwagon going for a football team once you think they're in the playoffs and going to win the championship or the Super Bowl.
[00:13:43.846 --> 00:13:48.667]  I would vote for the Constitution Party or I would vote for Ralph Nader.
[00:13:49.867 --> 00:13:51.008]  Ralph Nader?
[00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:53.228]  I didn't even know that there was people
[00:13:55.385 --> 00:13:58.181]  Running for president until yesterday.
[00:13:59.256 --> 00:14:03.237]  Until yesterday, and I looked it up, and you Google it once, you couldn't get it once.
[00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:08.719]  Well, and it's not that Nader or Chuck Baldwin are going to win.
[00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:14.901]  The whole point is, so much attention is put on this, and people think they're going to get changed with Obama.
[00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:15.422]  They're not.
[00:14:15.862 --> 00:14:18.002]  And they're not going to get changed with John McCain.
[00:14:18.022 --> 00:14:19.283]  They're owned by the same people.
[00:14:19.343 --> 00:14:28.306]  So, you know, I know you're saying you want to ask me how you should vote, and I'm honored by that, Stephanie, but I have to morally tell you, I can't tell you how I think
[00:14:28.926 --> 00:14:29.787]  Uh, you should vote.
[00:14:30.187 --> 00:14:35.212]  All I can tell you is that Barack Obama is in the hip pocket of the very bankers looting us.
[00:14:35.552 --> 00:14:44.901]  Now, I know Max Keiser doesn't like to, you know, get into these political footballs because he knows the bankers are above both Obama and McCain, so it doesn't matter at the end of the day, but, I mean, do you have a comment, Max?
[00:14:47.063 --> 00:14:51.046]  To the caller, or, you know, the... Well, who would you vote for?
[00:14:51.867 --> 00:14:55.070]  My position on Obama is that, uh,
[00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:57.753]  I support Obama.
[00:14:57.973 --> 00:15:01.396]  Here's what I'm going to do, Alex.
[00:15:01.956 --> 00:15:10.763]  When Bush came into office in 2000, I left the United States of America because I knew the guy was going to just be a horrible president to live in America.
[00:15:11.484 --> 00:15:13.406]  Here's what I'm thinking about.
[00:15:13.826 --> 00:15:17.049]  If Obama takes office, I may be moving back to America.
[00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:19.871]  I may be moving back to America because I want to test him.
[00:15:20.382 --> 00:15:23.823]  I want to test him with some of these civil disobedience ideas.
[00:15:23.843 --> 00:15:26.785]  I want to test him to see what this guy can really do for us.
[00:15:27.085 --> 00:15:32.247]  And if he doesn't pass the test, then it's time for us to take back our country in the most serious way we can.
[00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:45.232]  So you're saying, you're saying, give him a shot, see if he gets the troops out of Iraq, see what he does, see if he ends some of the illegal wiretapping, and then if he doesn't, morally then you're going to go after him politically?
[00:15:46.483 --> 00:15:47.063]  Absolutely!
[00:15:47.463 --> 00:15:49.964]  That's my constitutional responsibility.
[00:15:50.024 --> 00:16:03.966]  It says in the Constitution, quite clearly, that if in fact a tyrant is in control, and we've had a tyrant already, but if it gets to the point where it's going absolutely bonkers and even more tyrannical, then what are we going to do?
[00:16:04.006 --> 00:16:11.628]  Max, seven, eight months ago when he was saying he'd take all the troops out in the wiretapping, I went, hey, Jeremiah writes right about the AIDS virus.
[00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:12.608]  Maybe Obama's
[00:16:13.828 --> 00:16:20.052]  You know, he is a rogue and against the system, and you know, ooh, Hillary's trying to cheat him in New Hampshire.
[00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:21.013]  Maybe he's good.
[00:16:22.034 --> 00:16:25.036]  But then since then, he's gone back on everything.
[00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:29.499]  So, you know, it's up to you, Stephanie, to make up your own mind, okay?
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.581]  She still there?
[00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:33.962]  Yeah, hello?
[00:16:34.142 --> 00:16:34.642]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:16:35.322 --> 00:16:42.127]  Yes, I don't want to put my vote to a person that I know is a puppet.
[00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:44.179]  So I would feel guilty.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:54.283]  Even though I'm a minority in New York City and I'm in the urban setting, I would feel so guilty knowing what I listened to, to you.
[00:16:55.123 --> 00:16:58.324]  And I really respect you and I honor what you say.
[00:16:59.224 --> 00:17:06.147]  And just for me hearing your word, your spoken word, it was even a mission to me to even hear your wisdom words.
[00:17:06.927 --> 00:17:09.988]  So I'm not going to put my vote on Obama.
[00:17:10.555 --> 00:17:11.176]  Or McCain.
[00:17:11.216 --> 00:17:16.760]  That's why I want an independent or another person that I will put my vote to.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.582]  And the point is you've done the moral thing.
[00:17:18.722 --> 00:17:19.062]  Thank you.
[00:17:19.382 --> 00:17:25.808]  And if more people did what Stephanie's doing and voted who they really thought was the best person with the best ideas...
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.325]  This non-status, non-centralization control, then we would have people like Ron Paul.
[00:17:32.745 --> 00:17:36.869]  We would have people like Ralph Nader or Cynthia McKinney.
[00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.792]  You can even vote for Cynthia McKinney over them.
[00:17:41.213 --> 00:17:41.993]  Thank you so much.
[00:17:42.013 --> 00:17:46.077]  We're going to take more calls later, but I'm going to let Max Keiser have the final comments.
[00:17:46.457 --> 00:17:48.179]  Max, plug your website for folks out there.
[00:17:49.907 --> 00:17:54.388]  MaxKaiser.com, K-E-I-S-E-R, MaxKaiser.com.
[00:17:54.628 --> 00:18:02.050]  I'll just make a comment that my friend Stephen Baldwin, who I used to pal around with in Los Angeles, he's a brother of Alec Baldwin, of course.
[00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.090]  He's now a brainwashed minion of George Bush.
[00:18:04.991 --> 00:18:08.492]  Yeah, he said that if Obama wins, he's going to move to Canada.
[00:18:09.392 --> 00:18:11.372]  So we may be passing each other on the airplane.
[00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:17.154]  We'll be leaving with a kick between his legs, and I'll be coming back to, you know, basically
[00:18:19.888 --> 00:18:28.934]  Fight for what I believe everyone should be fighting for, which is an equitable representation of who we are as a people.
[00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:57.257]  I've known him for a long time.
[00:18:57.517 --> 00:18:59.559]  He's obviously got very strong beliefs.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:07.229]  He acts on his beliefs, so I can't fault him for at least acting on his beliefs.
[00:19:07.309 --> 00:19:08.330]  I'm just saying that if I act
[00:19:08.763 --> 00:19:15.387]  On my beliefs, in this situation, I feel that this is an opportune time.
[00:19:15.827 --> 00:19:22.210]  This could be a moment in history that could be very... Yeah, those carbon taxes are going to save us, Max.
[00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.111]  So, how'd you meet Stephen Baldwin?
[00:19:26.773 --> 00:19:34.757]  Well, you know, he was working with me in Los Angeles on the Hollywood Stock Exchange, and we were partners on that project for
[00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.905]  For a couple of years, and I know him actually from Long Island.
[00:19:37.925 --> 00:19:39.086]  I met him when he was 12 years old.
[00:19:39.306 --> 00:19:40.327]  I know his brother very well.
[00:19:41.688 --> 00:19:43.470]  Man, you're in a lot of business!
[00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:49.156]  His brother is producing and is one of the producers on my new TV show for BBC World.
[00:19:50.317 --> 00:19:50.637]  Oh, really?
[00:19:50.757 --> 00:19:51.298]  Alec is?
[00:19:52.119 --> 00:19:58.165]  Yeah, I got a new TV show coming out on BBC World called The Oracle, which is about prediction markets.
[00:19:59.011 --> 00:20:00.394]  Alec is one of the producers.
[00:20:00.494 --> 00:20:01.837]  I want to have you on the show.
[00:20:01.857 --> 00:20:02.398]  I want to come on.
[00:20:02.438 --> 00:20:03.280]  Hold on one second.
[00:20:03.561 --> 00:20:06.366]  We're going to skip this break on the internet so we can finish up with a story.
[00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:21.736]  Yeah, Max, I haven't really built you up properly for the audience out there, that you're a pretty influential guy, and that's what's so scary about you talking about devaluing the dollar, devaluing the currency, going to a Bretton Woods system.
[00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:36.543]  So in the few minutes we've got left with you, and this is just for the internet audience, but it's millions, tell folks more about the TV show, more about your website and what you do, how folks tune into your radio show, and then a few minutes about what that new currency is going to look like, and then we'll let you go.
[00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.330]  Okay.
[00:20:40.451 --> 00:20:41.511]  We're on air right now, go ahead.
[00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:44.032]  Oh yeah, sorry.
[00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:47.953]  Right, well you've got this new show working on BBC World.
[00:20:48.353 --> 00:20:50.634]  It's going to be hopefully starting up in January.
[00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:53.695]  And as I mentioned, Alec is the producer on the show.
[00:20:53.755 --> 00:20:54.535]  It's called The Oracle.
[00:20:54.995 --> 00:20:59.096]  I'm taking all these prediction markets that are out there now that have come after the Hollywood Stock Exchange.
[00:20:59.636 --> 00:21:04.618]  And as you point out in the introduction, I invented this whole idea of prediction markets and invented the technology of it.
[00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:09.540]  So we're going to have a panel of experts and guests kind of figure out what the future's going to be.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:19.648]  So an issue like this Brenton Woods Accord, we'll have a couple of experts, we'll have a couple of non-experts to try and pick it apart, and we'll try to figure out, and we'll look at the markets.
[00:21:20.008 --> 00:21:26.153]  Because the markets are generally anticipate or discount future events more accurately than any news pundit.
[00:21:26.213 --> 00:21:31.857]  If you notice, the prediction markets on sites like intrade.com have predicted an Obama victory now for months.
[00:21:32.185 --> 00:21:39.388]  They predicted all of the Senatorial and House of Representatives victories much more accurately than any of the polling or the pundits.
[00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:46.592]  So this is a show that's based on that concept and bringing those prediction markets to a global audience on BBC World.
[00:21:47.252 --> 00:21:56.276]  And as I mentioned before the break, it would be great to have you on the show, of course, because your insights into how these various world pieces work together.
[00:21:56.296 --> 00:21:59.618]  On the Brentwood issue, this is something that
[00:22:00.109 --> 00:22:06.894]  If you just look at it from any kind of perspective other than the myopic inside the U.S.
[00:22:07.275 --> 00:22:12.139]  perspective, you'll see that, quite clearly, the appetite of the global community for U.S.
[00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:14.420]  dollars is diminishing, and the U.S.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:20.745]  rolls over trillions of dollars worth of paper every single quarter, and if they can't refinance that paper, the U.S.
[00:22:20.785 --> 00:22:25.349]  would immediately go bankrupt, and the only way they're going to appease these foreign creditors
[00:22:25.979 --> 00:22:28.000]  Is to give them a throw of the bone.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.442]  Either they devalue the dollar, or they have to give them California.
[00:22:32.083 --> 00:22:33.304]  You know, they have to give them something.
[00:22:33.444 --> 00:22:37.146]  So what will that new currency Max Keiser look like?
[00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:48.553]  Well, you know, the new dollar currency, I know that there's a lot of talk about the emiro, of course, the North American currency.
[00:22:49.494 --> 00:22:51.715]  I'm not certain that's what's going to happen first.
[00:22:53.897 --> 00:22:59.399]  I think before we see something like that, you're going to see simply, you know, that the U.S.
[00:22:59.439 --> 00:23:02.741]  has gotten very, very good at, you know, issuing these new currencies.
[00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:05.682]  In the last couple of years, remember, they just came out with a peach-colored currency?
[00:23:05.702 --> 00:23:05.862]  Yes.
[00:23:06.042 --> 00:23:07.383]  A peach-colored five-digit number.
[00:23:07.623 --> 00:23:09.444]  And they keep saying, we need it for the security.
[00:23:09.744 --> 00:23:11.785]  But basically, they're just, it's a dry run.
[00:23:11.805 --> 00:23:14.886]  They're conditioning us to accept a new color, a new look, yeah.
[00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:15.887]  Exactly.
[00:23:16.047 --> 00:23:16.987]  So this is just a dry run.
[00:23:17.007 --> 00:23:20.889]  There's no need to issue a new currency with the frequency that they do.
[00:23:21.331 --> 00:23:23.155]  They're just testing the technology.
[00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:28.325]  And they're getting us ready to recall all the old notes and everybody that's got a mattress away to say that they're worthless.
[00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:30.074]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:31.375]  I was here during the Euro.
[00:23:31.395 --> 00:23:32.095]  You know, the Euro.
[00:23:32.435 --> 00:23:34.136]  In one day, he had a French Frank.
[00:23:34.557 --> 00:23:35.037]  It's no good.
[00:23:35.217 --> 00:23:36.658]  You have to have a Euro.
[00:23:36.778 --> 00:23:37.638]  Well, Max, do this.
[00:23:37.838 --> 00:23:44.441]  Obviously, I'd be honored to come on your show anytime, and we're really honored and very respectful and appreciative of your important time.
[00:23:44.481 --> 00:23:45.402]  I know you're an in-demand.
[00:23:45.702 --> 00:23:53.166]  And I would love, because I'm a huge fan of him, I would love to get you and Alec Baldwin, even if it was on for ten minutes, sometime in the future, here on the show.
[00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:57.408]  So maybe you can help us set that up to promote the TV show when it's coming out.
[00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:05.774]  Well, you know, we're going to focus on the TV show, and as you know, we're also going to share a venue with Press TV.
[00:24:05.934 --> 00:24:14.820]  You know, I've been on Press TV a lot, and I'm trying to set something up with you and me, and Press TV talking about some of these issues as well, because I think that's an excellent venue.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.602]  Press TV, as you point out today, it's an international audience.
[00:24:17.842 --> 00:24:19.703]  It's based in Iran.
[00:24:20.203 --> 00:24:22.245]  You know, there's still... Hold on, we're going back to the full audience.
[00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:23.666]  I'm going to say bye to you here, to the full audience.
[00:24:23.686 --> 00:24:23.906]  Here we go.
[00:24:40.916 --> 00:24:43.357]  Yeah, no more Mr. Nice Guy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:43.497 --> 00:24:47.579]  The New World Order is being born right in front of you and America is dying financially.
[00:24:48.119 --> 00:24:56.423]  Max Keiser, in closing, fire out your website again and tell us if you think this country is ever going to emerge in the next decade out of what we're facing.
[00:24:58.266 --> 00:24:58.506]  Right.
[00:24:58.666 --> 00:25:02.487]  MaxKaiser.com, M-A-X-K-E-I-S-E-R.
[00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:04.648]  There's a link also to the radio show that we do.
[00:25:04.728 --> 00:25:11.749]  I do a pod show with Stacy, who's my significant other, I guess you could call her, my love of my life.
[00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:17.671]  And we do a daily show, plus we have our weekly show on Resonance 104.4, The Truth About Markets.
[00:25:18.151 --> 00:25:23.452]  But the question about the future of the dollar and the currency, as we were just discussing it,
[00:25:24.068 --> 00:25:30.974]  It's not that hard to simply reissue a currency and it has a different value, different serial numbers.
[00:25:31.014 --> 00:25:33.536]  We've already seen new issues, new currencies issued in the U.S.
[00:25:33.816 --> 00:25:36.918]  a few times over the past few years, different colors, different configurations.
[00:25:36.938 --> 00:25:37.739]  So they're getting us ready.
[00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:42.963]  Bottom line, get into gold now because you're saying you think all the evidence shows it's going to double by when?
[00:25:45.125 --> 00:25:48.708]  Well, when it does double, for two points, when it does double,
[00:25:49.446 --> 00:25:55.313]  I have a very strong belief that it'll happen so fast that if you don't already own it, you won't be able to buy it.
[00:25:55.454 --> 00:25:56.034]  It'll be too late.
[00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:57.416]  You can't buy it right now!
[00:25:58.578 --> 00:26:00.300]  Well, yeah, well, I mean, you can buy it.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.361]  Just at a premium.
[00:26:02.022 --> 00:26:07.288]  You can buy, for example, you know, if you go to a site like goldmoney.com, okay?
[00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:08.069]  Goldmoney.com.
[00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:14.282]  You go to that site, you can buy gold, and it's stored in either London or Switzerland.
[00:26:14.602 --> 00:26:18.284]  It's allocated gold in your name, held outside of the United States.
[00:26:18.324 --> 00:26:20.565]  You can go collect the gold if you want, anytime you want to.
[00:26:20.885 --> 00:26:22.466]  I know goldmoney.com.
[00:26:22.506 --> 00:26:23.746]  I saw a guy named James Turk.
[00:26:24.086 --> 00:26:25.147]  He's a reputable guy.
[00:26:25.707 --> 00:26:26.928]  I have an account there myself.
[00:26:27.108 --> 00:26:28.689]  He's a full disclosure.
[00:26:28.889 --> 00:26:29.869]  He's a fantastic guy.
[00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:30.730]  He holds the gold.
[00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.130]  You get the current price.
[00:26:32.611 --> 00:26:33.251]  You know, that's it.
[00:26:33.491 --> 00:26:34.412]  You now have some gold.
[00:26:34.652 --> 00:26:37.053]  It gives you peace of mind, and these currencies,
[00:26:37.822 --> 00:26:55.775]  Unfortunately, all the banking fraud that has happened in the last 25 years, you know, starting with Mike Milken, you know, Mike Milken really ushered in, in the 1980s, a period of fraud that has just built up over 25 years, and then long-term capital management was another huge chapter.
[00:26:55.795 --> 00:26:57.216]  And now it's all coming to a head.
[00:26:57.636 --> 00:27:00.158]  Max, let's get you back up in the near future.
[00:27:00.478 --> 00:27:02.720]  I appreciate you coming on with us, and we'll talk to you soon.
[00:27:03.792 --> 00:27:04.472]  All right, thanks Alex.
[00:27:04.952 --> 00:27:05.212]  You bet.
[00:27:05.232 --> 00:27:06.473]  There goes Max Keiser.
[00:27:06.493 --> 00:27:07.853]  Boy, that guy is something else.
[00:27:07.893 --> 00:27:13.474]  He's involved in just... He really did invent a bunch of some of the most modern systems that are used today.
[00:27:13.934 --> 00:27:15.234]  He's got his fingers in everything.
[00:27:15.254 --> 00:27:19.715]  I guess he's got his fingers in this show now, and we're glad to have our fingers in what he's doing.
[00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:20.936]  Very, very interesting person.
[00:27:21.236 --> 00:27:26.397]  And I think it's fine and dandy if you live in Europe to have it in one of their vaults, and they've got vaults here in the U.S., but he's right.
[00:27:26.837 --> 00:27:29.177]  Gold has been confiscated before, and people always ask me this.
[00:27:29.578 --> 00:27:31.178]  Well, then why would you hold gold?
[00:27:32.093 --> 00:27:32.793]  We're good to go.
[00:27:53.567 --> 00:28:05.110]  When it does go up, and it will because of the dollar devaluation, they've only been manipulating things right now, where you can hardly buy it, well there's a huge premium, and when you can find it there's a premium, but then gold was dropping, just like oil.
[00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.270]  This is manipulation.
[00:28:07.451 --> 00:28:11.612]  But when it finally does go back up, which law of
[00:28:12.659 --> 00:28:14.801]  Supply and demand says they can't suppress it forever.
[00:28:15.281 --> 00:28:16.462]  It is good to physically hold it.
[00:28:16.702 --> 00:28:20.205]  And sure, I mean, the government can come take your house, they can come take your life, they can come take your guns.
[00:28:20.605 --> 00:28:23.968]  I'm still going to own guns and buy more guns, even if they're going to try to come take them.
[00:28:24.388 --> 00:28:25.689]  The whole point is you don't give it up.
[00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:28.051]  The whole point is you don't have it in the state you're in.
[00:28:28.671 --> 00:28:36.057]  The whole point is that, well, let's bring Ted Anderson up for this segment and into the next, and then I'm going to get Dean Barkley to pop in, and then your phone calls.
[00:28:37.523 --> 00:28:41.146]  Ted, you, because you've been in this business so long, you have gold and silver.
[00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:45.850]  And you have it at below the prices it's selling at, instead of giant premiums.
[00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:50.194]  And I agree with Max Keiser, people are insane if they don't get gold.
[00:28:50.234 --> 00:28:52.716]  But I wouldn't trust, really, any bank or any vault.
[00:28:53.056 --> 00:28:53.576]  I would hold it.
[00:28:54.317 --> 00:28:54.998]  You're right about that.
[00:28:55.038 --> 00:28:56.459]  You should have it in your own possession.
[00:28:56.499 --> 00:29:02.604]  Plus, also, one of the things you have to remember, Alex, that most of the European countries confiscate and illegalize gold as well.
[00:29:03.143 --> 00:29:12.633]  As a matter of fact, the United States was one of the first nations to make gold legal to own, and if you had gold traveling through other countries, you had to be very careful because you'd be breaking their laws.
[00:29:13.073 --> 00:29:18.899]  We are actually one of the more, believe it or not, liberated states still, or countries, you know, about owning gold.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.485]  At this time, I'm sure that those countries, if anybody's going to confiscate gold, it's going to be Europe first.
[00:29:25.069 --> 00:29:26.991]  I'm sure the Soviet bloc's gonna follow.
[00:29:27.591 --> 00:29:34.837]  And yeah, you gotta be careful with these nations because I trust them less than I trust the United States and I don't trust this place very much at all.
[00:29:36.761 --> 00:29:39.022]  John, I want you to get Dean Barkley on in about eight afterwards.
[00:29:39.042 --> 00:29:40.123]  We're going to do five minutes with him.
[00:29:40.143 --> 00:29:49.388]  I want to hold Ted over and talk about what he's seeing as thirty years in the gold and silver market, twelve years, thirteen years with Midas Resources, what he's seeing happen right now.
[00:29:49.408 --> 00:29:53.330]  Because it's even admitted, mainstream news, that they are manipulating the gold and silver market.
[00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.691]  And yeah, things are only set to go back up.
[00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:56.551]  The sky's the limit.
[00:29:57.892 --> 00:29:59.713]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:30:00.073 --> 00:30:01.674]  I want to keep talking to Ted, John, okay?
[00:30:02.795 --> 00:30:03.215]  Hey, Ted?
[00:30:05.692 --> 00:30:08.538]  Is Ted, since he's in studio there, able to hear me when I skip breaks, John?
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.021]  Yep, he should.
[00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:10.602]  Go ahead.
[00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:11.564]  Or he'd run off.
[00:30:12.285 --> 00:30:12.926]  Hey, Ted, you there?
[00:30:12.946 --> 00:30:17.034]  Yeah, go in there and get him to put his headset back on.
[00:30:17.851 --> 00:30:19.133]  He's going back in the studio right now.
[00:30:19.493 --> 00:30:20.214]  Okay, great.
[00:30:20.754 --> 00:30:31.427]  Anyways, folks, I do believe in owning gold and silver, and I see this down market, though it's going back up right now in the last few days, as all commodities are.
[00:30:31.807 --> 00:30:34.029]  I mean, wheat's selling at, what, four times what it was a year ago.
[00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.592]  I see this as a buying opportunity.
[00:30:37.293 --> 00:30:40.574]  And I think people are insane if they don't buy gold and silver.
[00:30:40.614 --> 00:30:43.375]  Now, we're going to pitch folks on this, Ted, when we get back.
[00:30:44.095 --> 00:30:47.636]  And, well, I sure sleep good at night knowing that, because I bought gold at $280 an ounce.
[00:30:47.696 --> 00:30:50.677]  I bought it when it was $1,000 an ounce.
[00:30:50.717 --> 00:30:52.218]  I bought it when it was $600 an ounce.
[00:30:53.298 --> 00:30:56.799]  And people psychologically only tend to buy when it's going up.
[00:30:56.819 --> 00:31:04.001]  Well, it is going up today, but nothing like it's going to be going up in the future if any common sense or any reality reigns in the world.
[00:31:05.956 --> 00:31:12.798]  Ted Kaiser was talking about gold doubling if they do a new Bretton Woods agreement and kill the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:23.662]  Well, he's right about that and I don't know how they cannot do that because the United States is so far beyond repair and the value of the United States currency, nobody trusts it.
[00:31:24.002 --> 00:31:26.363]  I mean, nobody trusts what we're doing here in the United States.
[00:31:26.403 --> 00:31:30.684]  This bailout thing is really bad for the United States and the value
[00:31:31.124 --> 00:31:34.866]  The value of its currency, the value of the institutions that are out there.
[00:31:34.886 --> 00:31:43.690]  I mean, you just can't trust the United States to be conservative and economically sound.
[00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:47.511]  Because we're going to bail out every single problem now that comes along.
[00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:49.292]  Every time there's a big company...
[00:31:49.292 --> 00:31:50.292]  But it's not bailouts.
[00:31:50.312 --> 00:31:52.793]  They're only giving it to themselves.
[00:31:52.833 --> 00:31:59.835]  We have the JP Morgan head and others saying, we're just giving ourselves $500 million bonuses apiece and laughing in front of reporters.
[00:32:00.076 --> 00:32:01.316]  I mean, these arrogant bastards.
[00:32:01.356 --> 00:32:03.077]  It's not enough to steal $5 trillion from us.
[00:32:03.297 --> 00:32:05.697]  That's what it already is, $5 trillion.
[00:32:05.777 --> 00:32:06.818]  That's not enough, Ted!
[00:32:07.038 --> 00:32:09.959]  They have to rub it in and brag about it in front of everybody.
[00:32:10.239 --> 00:32:11.999]  I know, and that's the thing about it.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.640]  That's why there's so little trust left.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.341]  I mean, if you're sitting outside of this nation,
[00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:18.702]  And you're investing in U.S.
[00:32:18.782 --> 00:32:34.686]  dollar and you watch the United States government come in and sign a bill that's going to create another trillion dollars to be injected into the system and then you see the elites or the CEOs and all the... Freezing the credit markets so they can consolidate.
[00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:42.351]  Yeah, they're playing right into the hand of, you know, the people of the United States were right.
[00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:44.553]  We should not have done that bailout.
[00:32:44.773 --> 00:32:48.496]  Nobody wanted it, and for some reason our politicians did it.
[00:32:50.717 --> 00:32:54.200]  I hope every single person that voted for that bill has voted out of office.
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.882]  Jeff, we're going to go back to the full audience here in ten seconds.
[00:32:57.202 --> 00:33:01.305]  Right now we're on PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars streams, but I didn't want to waste any time.
[00:33:01.325 --> 00:33:03.867]  Did you call Dean Barkley, John?
[00:33:04.423 --> 00:33:04.763]  Not yet.
[00:33:04.823 --> 00:33:05.743]  What time do you want him at?
[00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:06.744]  Thirty-eight after?
[00:33:07.164 --> 00:33:09.044]  Yeah, just call him and say we're calling him in five minutes.
[00:33:09.064 --> 00:33:09.625]  Okay, got it.
[00:33:09.645 --> 00:33:10.785]  And I'm going to take some final calls.
[00:33:10.825 --> 00:33:11.165]  Here we go.
[00:33:20.088 --> 00:33:22.329]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913.
[00:33:22.369 --> 00:33:28.171]  Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[00:33:31.082 --> 00:33:34.704]  A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid.
[00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:39.827]  So, Cyrus Jones, live forever.
[00:33:41.508 --> 00:33:42.849]  Grave digger.
[00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:44.810]  Here goes the Republic up in flames.
[00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:47.552]  I'm a lottery admirer.
[00:33:54.304 --> 00:33:55.665]  Don't usually smoke.
[00:33:55.765 --> 00:34:07.530]  I've cut it back to almost nothing, but I figured, kind of as a symbol of the country going up in smoke, burning away as the public has suckered one more time to support Barack Obama, I'd fire up a cigarette here on air.
[00:34:08.771 --> 00:34:18.436]  Yes, it's okay if I was a fake Christian conservative and killed a million and a half Iraqis in the last six years, but if I smoke a cigarette, I'll go to hell.
[00:34:23.766 --> 00:34:29.032]  Let's go back to Ted Anderson and then we're going to get Dean Barkley on.
[00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:31.514]  Then some of your phone calls here at the end.
[00:34:31.534 --> 00:34:36.380]  I'll give you some of the latest election news as it comes in for everybody.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:44.864]  Ted Anderson, we were ranting and raving on the internet behind-the-scenes portion of the show there about the banker takeover.
[00:34:45.905 --> 00:34:57.413]  We were talking about just the open arrogance, the biggest looting ever to offshore corporations, and they're openly manipulating the gold market, and now the hyperinflation is kicking back off again, Ted.
[00:34:58.021 --> 00:35:01.862]  Yeah, we're going to see an awful lot of that, because we all know that we're going to have inflation.
[00:35:01.882 --> 00:35:08.564]  You can't sit and inject another trillion dollars into the system without having a devaluation of the money that already exists out there.
[00:35:09.044 --> 00:35:20.547]  We have earned it, we've worked for it, and now they're printing money for nothing, and they're giving it away to these CEOs or whatever, these big corporations, and they're taking these big distributions.
[00:35:22.569 --> 00:35:22.889]  I don't know.
[00:35:42.939 --> 00:35:50.947]  So help me, I gotta tell ya, there should not be a politician going back to Washington D.C.
[00:35:51.187 --> 00:35:52.829]  that voted for this bailout package.
[00:35:52.869 --> 00:35:56.933]  That was one of the worst things they've ever done to us, and they set a precedence
[00:35:57.313 --> 00:36:06.036]  That now every time one of these big corporations are going to have a problem, they're going to be dumping money into their, you know, they'll create problems so they can have this money.
[00:36:06.076 --> 00:36:19.881]  I mean, it's like free money to them, and it's just creating a huge, monstrous monopoly that's just going to come crashing down, and the people, the taxpayers, the people that actually struggle to make a living in this world are the ones that end up paying the bill.
[00:36:20.861 --> 00:36:22.982]  It really burns my butt, I can tell you.
[00:36:23.042 --> 00:36:26.483]  Ted, looking at the market and the things, as a gold broker, silver broker,
[00:36:28.123 --> 00:36:28.923]  What's it like right now?
[00:36:28.943 --> 00:36:32.905]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of places still saying they're sold out of gold and silver, or there's huge premiums.
[00:36:33.566 --> 00:36:35.987]  Mainstream press reports talking about 50% premiums.
[00:36:36.007 --> 00:36:38.148]  You've actually got it at the price it is.
[00:36:38.468 --> 00:36:39.529]  Tell folks about those numbers.
[00:36:39.649 --> 00:36:40.129]  Yeah, sure.
[00:36:40.209 --> 00:36:50.774]  I can tell you right now, I locked into a whole bunch of it here when gold was at $7.20, and silver was sitting there right around, it was at $9.87 an ounce right in there when I was picking it up.
[00:36:51.514 --> 00:36:53.535]  Right now, yeah, the premiums are way up there.
[00:36:53.575 --> 00:36:54.396]  Ridiculous.
[00:36:54.496 --> 00:36:56.557]  Especially like Silver Eagles and that kind of thing.
[00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:59.319]  I just ran into a nice group of Philharmonics.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.081]  If you're interested in those, you can get those.
[00:37:01.462 --> 00:37:07.928]  But what I picked up here is I picked up a whole bunch of the dimes.
[00:37:08.228 --> 00:37:10.871]  I mean, you watch the economy and the way that things are going.
[00:37:11.171 --> 00:37:12.633]  The dimes right now are cheap.
[00:37:12.653 --> 00:37:13.233]  You can get them at $1.60.
[00:37:13.293 --> 00:37:17.598]  They were trading close to $1.80 a piece here just a few months ago.
[00:37:17.958 --> 00:37:20.959]  My goodness, gold is up $41 today.
[00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:21.579]  It is.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.920]  I hadn't even looked.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.621]  It's at $7.63 and 10 cents.
[00:37:26.762 --> 00:37:27.902]  Silver is way up.
[00:37:28.422 --> 00:37:32.164]  So, Ted, you locked in at gold at $7.21, you said?
[00:37:32.284 --> 00:37:33.384]  Well, that's the thing, Alex.
[00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:36.245]  Tell folks the coins you've got right now.
[00:37:36.285 --> 00:37:38.386]  Yeah, right now I've got the British Sovereign coin.
[00:37:38.406 --> 00:37:40.267]  That coin right now is trading at $241.
[00:37:40.987 --> 00:37:41.848]  I picked up the francs.
[00:37:41.928 --> 00:37:43.308]  I was able to get those down below $200.
[00:37:43.888 --> 00:37:44.549]  I've got them now at $198.
[00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:50.771]  That is not going to stay there, because the gold price has just jumped up again another 60 bucks.
[00:37:50.891 --> 00:37:52.171]  Okay, again, you bought at the bottom.
[00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:55.952]  It's up since you bought it, 40-something bucks.
[00:37:56.753 --> 00:38:04.835]  Regardless, ladies and gentlemen, this isn't like your dollar, where they're openly announcing Bretton Woods, a new global currency run by the bankers that engineered all this.
[00:38:04.975 --> 00:38:07.935]  All the financial experts are saying that is going to destroy the dollar.
[00:38:08.515 --> 00:38:10.216]  Whatever manipulation they do in the short term,
[00:38:11.466 --> 00:38:16.850]  All of the history, all of basic monetary facts shows gold and silver and other commodities are only going to explode.
[00:38:26.098 --> 00:38:29.520]  I have some people that set up IRAs and they put it into these institutions.
[00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.642]  That's fine if you're going to speculate.
[00:38:31.982 --> 00:38:37.225]  If you're so afraid of paying the taxes by taking an early distribution, it's better than not having it.
[00:38:37.525 --> 00:38:43.409]  But to have your gold and silver stored away and having a certificate that says that you own gold somewhere,
[00:38:44.009 --> 00:38:46.030]  And you're going to have an economic meltdown like this?
[00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.951]  I mean, it's like having a picture of... Alright, well tell them the gold coins and the silver coins.
[00:38:50.251 --> 00:38:51.872]  You've got it way below their current price.
[00:38:51.912 --> 00:38:55.373]  Yeah, right now we have, again, it's the franc coin that's trading at $198 per coin.
[00:38:55.413 --> 00:38:56.754]  And then in addition to this we also have...
[00:39:00.225 --> 00:39:02.526]  The British Sovereign, which is at $241.
[00:39:02.866 --> 00:39:05.888]  Both of those are just a fabulous buy at this particular time.
[00:39:06.328 --> 00:39:07.388]  And the silver right now, $169.
[00:39:08.609 --> 00:39:14.612]  And everybody knows that the silver's been $20, maybe $25 an ounce to buy physical silver.
[00:39:14.872 --> 00:39:17.433]  You're able to get this stuff at a really good price.
[00:39:17.473 --> 00:39:20.475]  The market is getting hot again, and you're not going to be able to buy it.
[00:39:21.515 --> 00:39:32.144]  There was a time here, Alex, just a short time ago, where you could have went to any coin dealer across the United States, and it's probably still true, you're not going to be able to fill any order of any significant size.
[00:39:32.524 --> 00:39:35.707]  I mean, you've got to be a big player in this business to get any kind of volume.
[00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:37.808]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:39:37.868 --> 00:39:42.772]  And I hate to say it, I mean, it's not really fair, but I'm going to be out there buying every time I see a dip.
[00:39:44.253 --> 00:39:45.595]  Ted, let me explain what you do.
[00:39:45.615 --> 00:39:46.035]  You buy gold.
[00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:04.674]  We're good to go.
[00:40:21.394 --> 00:40:25.055]  So you're not paying those big premiums because Ted is buying in bulk.
[00:40:25.315 --> 00:40:27.596]  He is passing that savings on to you.
[00:40:27.876 --> 00:40:29.417]  These are lost leaders for Ted.
[00:40:29.717 --> 00:40:30.757]  They have the British Sovereign.
[00:40:30.777 --> 00:40:32.678]  They have the French and Swiss francs.
[00:40:32.738 --> 00:40:35.379]  They have the different silver coins from the U.S.
[00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:35.519]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:40:35.539 --> 00:40:35.599]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:44.583]  2, 2, 3, 7.
[00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:44.583]  The brokers are there.
[00:40:44.623 --> 00:40:48.967]  Now, Ted, gold is up $41.10 and climbing today.
[00:40:49.067 --> 00:40:55.832]  How long can you hold the gold at $40 plus below what it is selling for in the open market?
[00:40:55.912 --> 00:41:04.820]  Well, I can tell you right now, Alex, I'm going to hold it until midnight tonight, and I'll just honor every transaction no matter what gold does, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's up again tomorrow.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.302]  Right now, remember, we're fishing around.
[00:41:07.642 --> 00:41:09.503]  I knew that there was a sell-off that was occurring.
[00:41:09.523 --> 00:41:11.325]  We're trying to find the bottom in the marketplace.
[00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.072]  I believe we found that at $7.20.
[00:41:13.953 --> 00:41:16.416]  I think that we're going to be seeing gold and silver prices going up.
[00:41:17.471 --> 00:41:18.892]  As we go on here, I know we talked about it.
[00:41:18.912 --> 00:41:26.415]  Well, regardless, it can't be completely devalued like paper money, and it's the oldest, you know, true wealth out there.
[00:41:26.435 --> 00:41:27.315]  800-686-2237.
[00:41:27.355 --> 00:41:28.675]  Take advantage of this today.
[00:41:29.016 --> 00:41:31.336]  Forty-something bucks under what it's even selling for.
[00:41:31.597 --> 00:41:35.378]  When most people can't even find it or get it or are paying huge premiums, you can't beat this deal.
[00:41:35.398 --> 00:41:35.778]  800-686-2237.
[00:41:37.059 --> 00:41:38.559]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[00:41:38.659 --> 00:41:40.000]  Yeah, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:40.500]  You bet.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.340]  Absolutely.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.121]  You know, we know people buy gold when the market's up.
[00:41:43.681 --> 00:41:45.163]  But Ted has the best of both worlds.
[00:41:45.263 --> 00:41:47.585]  He bought it when it was cheaper and is still offering it to you.
[00:41:47.825 --> 00:41:53.131]  For that, when everybody else is not just selling it for what it's currently selling at, they're tacking on huge margins.
[00:41:53.591 --> 00:41:54.632]  This deal's great.
[00:41:54.652 --> 00:41:54.933]  800-686-2237.
[00:41:56.815 --> 00:41:58.296]  I'll tell you what Ted's putting on these coins.
[00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:01.800]  He's putting about 3.5% on them just to pay for the transaction.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:02.481]  Okay?
[00:42:03.261 --> 00:42:03.561]  800-686-2237.
[00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.223]  Cannot beat the deal.
[00:42:06.503 --> 00:42:07.383]  I'm not going to keep him long.
[00:42:07.403 --> 00:42:10.225]  Just about five minutes, a really busy day of radio and TV interviews.
[00:42:10.245 --> 00:42:11.145]  He got on CNN.
[00:42:11.406 --> 00:42:15.068]  They're calling it a close race with 37% undecided in Minnesota.
[00:42:15.308 --> 00:42:16.208]  They're deciding right now.
[00:42:16.248 --> 00:42:20.671]  He was appointed by Governor Jesse Ventura, outgoing, when Senator Wellstone died in the tragic crash.
[00:42:21.511 --> 00:42:25.733]  So we can currently be called technically a former senator, but he was there for a month.
[00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:28.054]  We want to send him back for six years, a full term.
[00:42:28.394 --> 00:42:30.275]  He's on the Independent Party in Minnesota.
[00:42:30.555 --> 00:42:33.096]  Dean Barclay wants to thank the audience here.
[00:42:33.156 --> 00:42:35.537]  You got major TV buys for his ad.
[00:42:35.577 --> 00:42:38.198]  You can watch at SenatorBarclay.com.
[00:42:38.218 --> 00:42:40.579]  We also have it up at Infowars.com.
[00:42:40.619 --> 00:42:44.801]  You helped finish producing it and getting it on the air late last week and right through to today.
[00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:48.103]  So I wanted to just bring Dean Barclay up for five minutes.
[00:42:48.383 --> 00:42:49.283]  Dean, good to have you here.
[00:42:49.303 --> 00:42:50.844]  Nice to be on, Alex.
[00:42:51.621 --> 00:43:00.988]  I tell you, I just want to thank my audience, and I know you wanted a chance again to thank them, because regardless of what happens, it was another example of taking action the way they came in and gave to the campaign.
[00:43:01.008 --> 00:43:02.609]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:43:02.649 --> 00:43:05.551]  I mean, your listeners gave our campaign the boost we needed.
[00:43:05.571 --> 00:43:07.673]  We've been up on the air since last Thursday.
[00:43:08.334 --> 00:43:10.195]  The ads are going over very, very well.
[00:43:10.235 --> 00:43:11.416]  It's just the boost I needed.
[00:43:11.976 --> 00:43:13.698]  And who knows what's going to happen today.
[00:43:13.718 --> 00:43:16.760]  The Minnesota voters are going to decide what kind of future they want.
[00:43:20.089 --> 00:43:23.031]  Dean, I mean, what info can you give us?
[00:43:23.732 --> 00:43:25.053]  I mean, the polls are all over the map.
[00:43:25.113 --> 00:43:31.778]  It shows you've narrowed in some of them, but regardless, Ventura was eight points behind on Election Day and then won by, what, three points.
[00:43:32.258 --> 00:43:39.483]  I mean, as the results start coming in, when are they saying we're going to hear in Minnesota some of the results?
[00:43:39.523 --> 00:43:42.806]  I know it's going to be the reported record turnout in Minnesota.
[00:43:43.827 --> 00:43:47.990]  We already heard some early exit polling from the early voting we had in Minnesota.
[00:43:48.672 --> 00:43:50.756]  And we're doing phenomenally well in the early voting.
[00:43:50.776 --> 00:43:58.011]  We're in the low 30s in the exit polling, and that was in the metropolitan Minneapolis area, which is very strong Democratic territory.
[00:43:58.051 --> 00:43:59.294]  And that's in a three-way race.
[00:43:59.334 --> 00:44:00.116]  That's in a three-way.
[00:44:00.546 --> 00:44:01.806]  Right, that's in the three-way race.
[00:44:01.867 --> 00:44:02.847]  I'm in position here.
[00:44:03.187 --> 00:44:04.027]  Anything could happen.
[00:44:04.047 --> 00:44:05.968]  We're going to have a record turnout in Minnesota.
[00:44:06.228 --> 00:44:08.809]  They're predicting over an 80% voter turnout.
[00:44:09.149 --> 00:44:12.410]  And that means about 40% of those people showing up have not been polled.
[00:44:12.711 --> 00:44:13.711]  They haven't been counted.
[00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:18.913]  And depending on what those 40% do, they're going to elect the next senator from Minnesota, and I'm very confident.
[00:44:19.215 --> 00:44:20.576]  We may shock the world here again.
[00:44:20.636 --> 00:44:22.176]  Every ten years or so, we need a shock.
[00:44:22.556 --> 00:44:24.857]  Well, it's a big deal to send somebody to the U.S.
[00:44:24.917 --> 00:44:25.998]  Senate, and you've been there before.
[00:44:26.038 --> 00:44:28.638]  You need to go back this time for a full term, as I said earlier.
[00:44:29.019 --> 00:44:39.122]  The only thing that may kill you, and the thing I'm worried about, is mindless party voting, straight ticket voting, where somebody just lazily clicks for a whole party, Republican or Democrat.
[00:44:39.482 --> 00:44:46.045]  I hope they take the time out to go through all those races, and I hope they vote a split ticket, and I hope they vote for Dean Barkley.
[00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:55.761]  Well, you know, I know a lot of people in Minnesota now are thinking they like me, they like what I'm saying, they want to vote for me, but they're afraid that if they vote for me, they might get either Franken or Coleman.
[00:44:56.101 --> 00:45:01.326]  I'm saying vote for your first choice out of what you want, not out of your second choice out of fear of the third choice.
[00:45:01.546 --> 00:45:06.511]  You know, for once in your life, vote for who you want to do or who you want to send there, and if they do that, I will go.
[00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:07.512]  If they don't, I won't.
[00:45:07.532 --> 00:45:08.193]  It's that simple.
[00:45:08.453 --> 00:45:09.414]  If they vote their heart,
[00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:11.923]  Of what they really want, then I'll be your next U.S.
[00:45:11.963 --> 00:45:12.303]  Senator.
[00:45:12.343 --> 00:45:16.145]  But I don't know what the Minnesota voters are going to do, but I have confidence they're going to do the right thing.
[00:45:16.366 --> 00:45:21.229]  Well, it's like Governor Ventura always says, don't vote like it's a horse race for who you think the winner will be.
[00:45:21.329 --> 00:45:27.133]  Vote for the person that will say no to the bailout, no to the war, no to the war on drugs, no to the New World Order.
[00:45:27.153 --> 00:45:28.934]  Dean Barkley will do all of that.
[00:45:29.315 --> 00:45:34.178]  And regardless of what happens, I want to get you back up in the next few days to talk about the aftermath.
[00:45:34.338 --> 00:45:35.259]  Win, lose, or draw.
[00:45:35.679 --> 00:45:43.804]  And regardless, we win by taking action, so I salute the listeners of this show and Ted Anderson, who I know donated, and myself and everybody else who donated.
[00:45:44.264 --> 00:45:52.909]  Thank you, because we've got to at least stand up and vote for good third-party candidates when we get them, people who support Ron Paul, like Senator Dean Barkley.
[00:45:53.129 --> 00:45:54.290]  Dean, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.791]  Well, thank you, Alex, and again, thanks to your listeners.
[00:45:56.831 --> 00:45:57.572]  They made it happen.
[00:45:57.692 --> 00:45:58.012]  You bet.
[00:45:58.052 --> 00:45:59.073]  SenatorBarkley.com.
[00:45:59.113 --> 00:45:59.413]  Take care.
[00:46:00.942 --> 00:46:04.443]  Alright, I know we got a lot of calls here, John, and I got my call list mixed up.
[00:46:04.463 --> 00:46:06.184]  Let's just take a bunch of calls here at the end.
[00:46:06.224 --> 00:46:07.144]  Who's first up here?
[00:46:07.504 --> 00:46:08.384]  Josh in California.
[00:46:08.464 --> 00:46:09.645]  Josh in California.
[00:46:09.685 --> 00:46:10.445]  You're on the air.
[00:46:10.505 --> 00:46:10.865]  Welcome.
[00:46:11.926 --> 00:46:12.206]  Hi.
[00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:12.966]  Hi.
[00:46:13.906 --> 00:46:23.309]  I just wanted to tell you some experience at college I've had with trying to do 9-11 Truth and just some other side notes, I guess.
[00:46:23.629 --> 00:46:23.910]  Okay.
[00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.071]  I'm in a state university in California, and
[00:46:28.843 --> 00:46:38.146]  I actually just moved here about a year ago, and I noticed the market is basically tons of $500,000 houses just completely empty.
[00:46:38.166 --> 00:46:41.947]  You know, people couldn't even, the banks couldn't even get anybody to get in the houses.
[00:46:41.967 --> 00:46:46.468]  So I just, when I moved here, I was like, wow, you know, this is going to fall.
[00:46:46.488 --> 00:46:47.749]  And I started telling people that.
[00:46:47.769 --> 00:46:50.790]  I had no idea, but now it's happened.
[00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:52.990]  And so, you know, I just gained a little credibility.
[00:46:54.051 --> 00:46:54.651]  But there's been a
[00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:56.931]  Well, these were the two faith-seeking types
[00:47:23.657 --> 00:47:26.118]  I guess somebody just said I could be a bomb.
[00:47:26.478 --> 00:47:34.301]  It's kind of ironic that... No, no, it's all... Again, by having all the bomb drills and all the things, then people start seeing cardboard boxes or tin cans and thinking they're bombs.
[00:47:34.361 --> 00:47:35.121]  I've got to let you go.
[00:47:35.161 --> 00:47:37.382]  Your Skype phone is just unintelligible.
[00:47:37.422 --> 00:47:39.583]  Call me back when you're on a regular phone line sometime, Josh.
[00:47:40.003 --> 00:47:41.743]  Mike in California, you're on the air.
[00:47:41.783 --> 00:47:42.123]  Welcome.
[00:47:43.024 --> 00:47:43.624]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:47:43.664 --> 00:47:43.904]  Good.
[00:47:44.984 --> 00:47:45.565]  Let me be real quick.
[00:47:45.605 --> 00:47:49.126]  I just want to be... I just want to thank you for all the good work you do.
[00:47:49.206 --> 00:47:51.326]  I'm a follower of the Yom Kippur Lodge in Muhammad.
[00:47:51.347 --> 00:47:52.287]  I know you get a lot of calls.
[00:47:53.339 --> 00:47:56.643]  You know, question chops a little bit, but I think you're doing a good job of keeping up.
[00:47:56.784 --> 00:47:57.124]  Thank you.
[00:47:58.105 --> 00:48:10.582]  With that being said, I was going to echo, like, being that the New World Order is predominantly white, what do you think their plans are for the Black Legion that they use to do whatever they do?
[00:48:11.198 --> 00:48:12.619]  What is your long-term plan for those?
[00:48:12.879 --> 00:48:13.379]  Well, I agree.
[00:48:13.419 --> 00:48:16.981]  In fact, that's a point I meant to make in the first hour for an article we're writing about this.
[00:48:20.003 --> 00:48:26.326]  Barack Obama is coming into office when the economy is imploding, when everything's falling apart, when the dollar is dying.
[00:48:26.946 --> 00:48:40.752]  And so there's going to be a honeymoon, and then he's going to get blamed for all of it, and the image in people's minds is going to be, okay, 140 years after slavery was abolished, we get a black president and look what happens when the guy's a puppet and did none of it, runs none of it.
[00:48:41.032 --> 00:48:45.154]  And they're going to do all this evil in his name, and then blacks are going to get blamed for that.
[00:48:45.214 --> 00:48:48.475]  Just like Texans got blamed for George Bush when he's not from Texas.
[00:48:51.298 --> 00:48:56.159]  And why is it that the Black Panthers, you mentioned earlier, you said the Black Panthers are blocking whites from voting.
[00:48:56.299 --> 00:48:56.919]  What is that about?
[00:48:56.939 --> 00:48:58.599]  Well, no, I just reported it.
[00:48:58.619 --> 00:48:59.980]  This is the top of the Drudge Report.
[00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.560]  And I said it's from Fox News, so I said it may not be true.
[00:49:04.861 --> 00:49:05.361]  Oh, okay.
[00:49:06.081 --> 00:49:17.263]  And also, if the dollar completely collapses, if the economy completely collapses, do you think that that means the complete end of America?
[00:49:18.539 --> 00:49:27.201]  It means a hardcore police state, government control of jobs, hellish consolidation all by design, and it'll be up to the people whether we ever get out of it or not.
[00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:29.302]  The government needs confidence.
[00:49:29.362 --> 00:49:30.242]  It needs to have leaders.
[00:49:30.622 --> 00:49:34.363]  It's like when a lot of third world countries are being looted, they'll have another president every six months.
[00:49:34.383 --> 00:49:39.304]  Like, oh, change, change, change, just to stall the people while the bankers are stealing everything.
[00:49:39.884 --> 00:49:46.870]  And that's pretty much what I see Barack Obama as, as just stalling people, trying to fool them so that they think there's a change.
[00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:51.214]  When the same international banks run and own it all, they're the ones doing it.
[00:49:52.355 --> 00:49:56.518]  Look, they're announcing more brigades for the American people, more army on the streets.
[00:49:56.778 --> 00:49:58.360]  That's going to continue under Obama.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.001]  That would continue under McCain.
[00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:01.862]  These men are puppets.
[00:50:02.283 --> 00:50:05.906]  And as soon as we start realizing that, then we can start getting some real change.
[00:50:07.438 --> 00:50:23.523]  Yeah, because Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson with his Rainbow Push Coalition, when you talk about the lead in the water and the vaccine shots and all that stuff, none of these guys, I don't hate them, but none of them have done anything, have taken any steps to inform
[00:50:26.505 --> 00:50:28.026]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:50:28.086 --> 00:50:29.187]  We're under attack.
[00:50:29.267 --> 00:50:30.728]  The government's been taken over.
[00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:33.009]  It's a military-industrial complex.
[00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:40.353]  We're under martial law already, basically, with the culture and the media and Congress being threatened with martial law they didn't submit.
[00:50:41.053 --> 00:50:41.473]  And so...
[00:50:42.774 --> 00:50:55.403]  All we can do is talk about the real issues instead of these diversions about hope and change and then meanwhile Barack Obama's owned and paid for by the very same people that own John McCain and George Bush.
[00:50:55.764 --> 00:50:59.566]  That's all I'm pointing out is that people are going to see change more than New World Order.
[00:50:59.886 --> 00:51:01.628]  I'm going to skip this break too so we can finish up.
[00:51:02.088 --> 00:51:04.370]  Come back with more calls and cover what's happening with the election.
[00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:07.792]  We'll be tracking all the election fraud and any crises that unfold as well.
[00:51:09.545 --> 00:51:10.665]  Okay, let me go back to him.
[00:51:10.685 --> 00:51:14.926]  We're still on PrisonPlanet.tv and on the Infowars.com streams, Mike.
[00:51:14.946 --> 00:51:17.227]  You know, this hurts me.
[00:51:18.567 --> 00:51:19.527]  You're still there, right, Mike?
[00:51:20.107 --> 00:51:21.067]  Yeah, I'm here.
[00:51:21.247 --> 00:51:34.390]  Because I'm so angry with the government, the engineers, the eugenicists, the New World Order crowd, that I know are racist, I know are evil, I know put HIV in the vaccines, not just in Africa, but that's where they really focus things.
[00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:38.231]  I know they hate black people, especially for some reason.
[00:51:39.011 --> 00:51:48.975]  And so, then I see him with Barack Obama, and then I see him bought and paid for by the same people, and then I see, you know, compared to Bush, he looks great, he seems nicer, friendlier, smarter.
[00:51:49.396 --> 00:51:58.640]  You know, I'm so sick of George Bush, I love seeing somebody that at least can talk nice, because it doesn't make me feel like I'm being insulted with some stuttering drug addict moron like George Bush.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.442]  But at the same time, I know that he's New World Order, and I know it's going to end bad.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:09.261]  And then I got so many black folks and white liberals sending me emails going, you're just racist, you just don't want a black president.
[00:52:09.382 --> 00:52:10.422]  I could care less!
[00:52:10.462 --> 00:52:12.622]  Number one, I know presidents are puppets.
[00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:15.943]  So if I was a white racist, why would I care if there's some black puppet?
[00:52:16.664 --> 00:52:23.746]  And especially if I was a white racist, I want your take on this, I would love it that they're going to be setting him up and blame him for everything that's going to happen.
[00:52:24.106 --> 00:52:24.486]  Go ahead.
[00:52:25.286 --> 00:52:31.588]  Well, I agree, because then if they do blame him, it's like, okay, you had a black guy did it, or it happened under his watch type deal.
[00:52:31.608 --> 00:52:34.109]  So I can see it definitely going that route.
[00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:54.440]  But what I don't get, you know, and even though I'm a follower of Elijah Muhammad, I'm pretty sure we have some differences in our ideology, I just think folks should focus, we should focus on the things that we do agree on, and that is that you have an elite out there whose sole purpose is to go out and do harm to people, or create an unstable environment that they can control.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:54.980]  Well that's it.
[00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.581]  What's the name of the nation in Islam?
[00:52:56.661 --> 00:52:58.523]  The final call of the trumpet, what is it?
[00:52:59.742 --> 00:53:01.804]  Yeah, that's the paper, the final call, yeah.
[00:53:02.024 --> 00:53:13.573]  Yeah, but I mean, I remember reading Eustace Mullins, you know, ads for books about the private Federal Reserve, and don't take vaccines, and don't use drugs, the man shipping them in, and be strong, and have strong families.
[00:53:14.154 --> 00:53:18.777]  I totally agree with all of that, because I want all communities to be strong.
[00:53:19.078 --> 00:53:19.898]  I'm a moral person.
[00:53:19.918 --> 00:53:21.239]  I don't like seeing people do bad.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.902]  I'm not in race politics, but then I see
[00:53:24.542 --> 00:53:25.563]  I don't agree with him on that.
[00:53:25.583 --> 00:53:29.087]  I don't think we should support anyone that backs up policies that are detrimental to black people.
[00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:43.470]  Or anybody.
[00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:44.311]  Look, look, look.
[00:53:44.631 --> 00:53:46.852]  White folks love the police state in the black neighborhoods.
[00:53:46.872 --> 00:53:47.533]  The racist whites.
[00:53:47.553 --> 00:53:48.433]  About 30% of whites.
[00:53:48.853 --> 00:53:49.274]  They love it.
[00:53:49.294 --> 00:53:51.095]  Don't they know that's training for their neighborhood?
[00:53:51.615 --> 00:53:59.419]  I mean, my God, if I don't have empathy for a black child being killed with an HIV injection through a polio shot cover, I mean, how would I not empathize?
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.880]  I mean, how would I not care?
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:07.424]  I mean, people think we can kill Iraqi children, but then that won't happen to us here at home.
[00:54:07.804 --> 00:54:09.185]  Go ahead, you've got the floor, sir.
[00:54:09.585 --> 00:54:10.886]  Let's go back to the full audience here.
[00:54:15.607 --> 00:54:16.928]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:16.948 --> 00:54:18.310]  My SDN line just cut out.
[00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:19.191]  We'll get reconnected there.
[00:54:19.211 --> 00:54:21.033]  Having a lot of problems with those.
[00:54:21.473 --> 00:54:23.255]  You've got the final word here, Mike.
[00:54:23.315 --> 00:54:26.739]  I want to let you finish up with what I was just saying in the behind-the-scenes talk.
[00:54:31.175 --> 00:54:32.036]  Hello Mike, how are you?
[00:54:32.096 --> 00:54:32.636]  Can you hear me?
[00:54:32.676 --> 00:54:34.937]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on the
[00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:06.513]  People voted, people said, and it doesn't really matter who is going to be in office.
[00:55:06.933 --> 00:55:13.256]  They're both pretty much the same and it won't make any difference because they're both owned by the same people, the globalists.
[00:55:13.917 --> 00:55:14.677]  That's right.
[00:55:15.517 --> 00:55:16.038]  Globalists.
[00:55:16.238 --> 00:55:24.342]  So, you know, I can hear people getting really excited, oh, Obama's going to do this, Obama's going to do that.
[00:55:25.022 --> 00:55:26.443]  Well, he cannot do any of that.
[00:55:27.432 --> 00:55:28.733]  Any of that has not been approved.
[00:55:28.753 --> 00:55:39.080]  He just does not have the freedom to do all the things that he wants because he's going to do exactly what he was told to do.
[00:55:40.241 --> 00:55:45.444]  Anyways, the whole idea is to get all the people to go and vote.
[00:55:46.225 --> 00:55:55.931]  And recently I came across an interesting book of a gentleman that has done really in-depth good work on the Constitution.
[00:55:57.284 --> 00:56:00.686]  Process of voting.
[00:56:01.726 --> 00:56:11.171]  Basically, you mentioned previously that when people sometimes get stopped, pulled over, they can get arrested for being citizens.
[00:56:11.671 --> 00:56:14.752]  And the ones that are not citizens, they're just left alone.
[00:56:15.933 --> 00:56:18.474]  The whole thing is the key word here is citizen.
[00:56:19.194 --> 00:56:24.597]  And this book that I'm talking about is called The Red Amendment.
[00:56:25.457 --> 00:56:26.398]  It was written by
[00:56:26.963 --> 00:56:31.476]  That person who spent a lot of time researching the...
[00:56:34.261 --> 00:56:36.162]  That's the kind of stuff I deal with here on air.
[00:56:36.202 --> 00:56:38.344]  That's the great thing about the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:56:38.724 --> 00:56:42.946]  I've got these headphones blaring so I can hear that low caller and then that comes in.
[00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:46.849]  Yeah, caller, I'm going to let you go.
[00:56:47.149 --> 00:56:47.689]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:56:47.709 --> 00:56:49.791]  We're having technical difficulties right here at the end of the show.
[00:56:49.811 --> 00:56:51.692]  I appreciate your call.
[00:56:52.432 --> 00:56:55.534]  Sometimes things just go completely to hell in a handbasket here.
[00:56:55.554 --> 00:56:56.835]  We're not going to take any more calls.
[00:56:57.475 --> 00:57:00.397]  If any riots break out, God forbid, we're not saying that's going to happen.
[00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:02.679]  People will edit that together and have me saying it on the web.
[00:57:03.459 --> 00:57:10.943]  If anything breaks out like the police are saying it could, if anything develops, I'm sure there's already election fraud on both sides going on everywhere.
[00:57:10.983 --> 00:57:12.044]  It's constantly happening.
[00:57:12.064 --> 00:57:14.806]  We will have Bev Harris on tomorrow.
[00:57:16.462 --> 00:57:20.683]  We will have a host of other guests on tomorrow as we track.
[00:57:20.723 --> 00:57:22.084]  Tomorrow will really be the big show.
[00:57:22.464 --> 00:57:24.525]  In the aftermath, we're going to know who the president is.
[00:57:25.125 --> 00:57:29.106]  I'm up here tonight on foreign TV, foreign radio.
[00:57:29.266 --> 00:57:43.831]  I may sometime tonight just be listening to the audio streams at InfoWars.com and the feeds at PrisonPlanet.tv go live for a few hours tonight as things develop so we can report on what's happening.
[00:57:43.871 --> 00:57:44.171]  In fact,
[00:57:45.506 --> 00:57:46.808]  In fact, I'll just go live tonight.
[00:57:50.151 --> 00:57:52.614]  We should know a lot by 8 o'clock.
[00:57:53.495 --> 00:57:54.857]  I'll either go live at 8 p.m.
[00:57:54.897 --> 00:57:56.739]  Central or 9 p.m.
[00:57:56.759 --> 00:57:57.079]  Central.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.842]  And I'll do an hour or two then.
[00:57:59.862 --> 00:58:01.264]  I'm going to be up at the office doing interviews.
[00:58:01.304 --> 00:58:02.205]  I'll play it by ear.
[00:58:02.766 --> 00:58:05.509]  I've got an interview at 10 o'clock Central, so I've got to be off the air by then.
[00:58:06.761 --> 00:58:08.122]  I want to thank all the callers.
[00:58:08.463 --> 00:58:12.526]  I want to thank everybody that's tuning in to the radio show and the TV show.
[00:58:12.546 --> 00:58:14.588]  I want to thank all the affiliates, sponsors, everybody.
[00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:24.016]  Tonight we also have a toll-free number here at my studio and so we'll be able to take your phone calls and comment on the election.
[00:58:25.177 --> 00:58:26.479]  You know, instead of waffling around
[00:58:31.687 --> 00:58:34.788]  I'll go live tonight here at 8 o'clock.
[00:58:34.808 --> 00:58:36.288]  8 p.m.
[00:58:36.308 --> 00:58:42.870]  Alright, retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com at a key rant on the Left-Right Paradigm at the start of the show for 30 minutes.
[00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:43.450]  I think it's key.
[00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:44.191]  Please record it.
[00:58:44.211 --> 00:58:44.931]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:58:45.331 --> 00:58:45.991]  God bless you all.
[00:58:46.031 --> 00:58:46.711]  Thanks for tuning in.
[00:58:46.751 --> 00:58:47.092]  Take care.
[00:58:47.112 --> 00:58:47.632]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:50.032 --> 00:58:51.533]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
