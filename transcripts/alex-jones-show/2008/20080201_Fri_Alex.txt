[00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:08.850]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.350]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.011]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:16.292]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:20.914]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:41.453]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.836]  It is already the first day of February 2008.
[00:00:45.936 --> 00:00:50.740]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.926]  In the third hour, in studio, Paul Grudy, he was the funeral director who took the body of Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:19.229]  And then the federal government came in, Secret Service, FBI, and made him put the palm print of Lee Harvey Oswald on the Mannlicher Carcano rifle that supposedly shot three shots in right at six seconds.
[00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.784]  Just another absolute nail in the coffin.
[00:01:23.224 --> 00:01:27.406]  He lives here in Austin, Texas, and I'm making a film about the JFK assassination.
[00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.667]  The final word is really what it's going to be.
[00:01:29.687 --> 00:01:38.750]  And, uh, Jim Mars was saying, you know, he used to live in Dallas, but he lives in Austin now, out by Lake Travis.
[00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.091]  You ought to interview him.
[00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:41.971]  So I've gotten his phone number, but haven't called him yet.
[00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:48.074]  And I was at TalkFest last, uh, Saturday here in Austin for KLBJ 590.
[00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.705]  And guess who came to TalkFest?
[00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:55.108]  Guess who likes George Norrie and likes my show?
[00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:57.590]  Yes, it was Mr. Grootie.
[00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.552]  So he and his son were there, really nice people.
[00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:05.396]  So he'll be coming on the show in the third hour today.
[00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:13.443]  We're also scheduled coming up in the next hour to have the very successful, well-known hip-hop slash rap artist, Paris.
[00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:14.956]  Coming on the show.
[00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:24.821]  It's very frustrating to me that he's been trying to contact me for several years and I get so many thousands of emails to the main email account that we missed it repeatedly.
[00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:29.663]  So I put the call out, I guess Tuesday, I said, you know, I'm sick of not being able to talk to Paris.
[00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:35.926]  And he said he liked Road to Tyranny on his website back in 2002 and that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:39.888]  And I got an email from him then, but I can't ever get a hold of him and boom,
[00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:50.027]  He somehow got Aaron's number and called yesterday, so he's scheduled to be joining us coming up later in the broadcast as well.
[00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:54.568]  And you know how much I love his artistry, his work.
[00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.330]  Okay, really big news in the meantime.
[00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.231]  Let me just give you the headlines I have here in front of me.
[00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:05.712]  Coulter, I will vote for Hillary over McCain, Fox News.
[00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:08.153]  We'll break that down.
[00:03:09.418 --> 00:03:12.259]  Mexican farmers protest NAFTA.
[00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.179]  They hate it too.
[00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.859]  It's bad for the people, good for the elites.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.180]  Also, illegal immigrants.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.761]  It's in the law, unless they amend it now.
[00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:22.481]  The stimulus package.
[00:03:22.522 --> 00:03:24.902]  They're going to be getting tax rebates in Mexico.
[00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:30.624]  Also, Bloomberg Financial reported this yesterday.
[00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:31.284]  It was in the stack.
[00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:31.844]  I didn't get to it.
[00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:32.764]  It's huge news.
[00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:34.685]  Bigs, tips for rich.
[00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:35.405]  Expect war.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.502]  And he came out and he said you need to buy guns, canned food, water, fertilizer, wine, medicine, clothes, etc.
[00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:47.163]  and get a farm in the country.
[00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:48.923]  Total collapse.
[00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:52.444]  How many experts are saying this?
[00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:58.806]  I mean, this is a top expert from one of the biggest outfits out there, Morgan Stanley.
[00:03:58.826 --> 00:03:59.906]  He's one of their top people.
[00:04:01.221 --> 00:04:05.384]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm very, very concerned, and you better be very, very concerned.
[00:04:05.404 --> 00:04:07.926]  We don't get up here and talk about total collapse for nothing.
[00:04:09.287 --> 00:04:11.168]  Have you noticed that what we talk about comes true?
[00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:15.951]  Now, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but there is a very good chance it's going to happen.
[00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:18.793]  Kind of like playing in interstate traffic.
[00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.866]  Running back and forth between 18 wheelers, there's a good chance you're going to get run over.
[00:04:23.226 --> 00:04:23.786]  Don't do it.
[00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:25.348]  Well, we don't have a choice here.
[00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:27.990]  We're going into these waters.
[00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.870]  It's been orchestrated.
[00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.132]  We're going to cover that as well.
[00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:37.737]  Also, Bill Clinton saying, we just have to slow down our economy to fight global warming.
[00:04:38.198 --> 00:04:40.059]  Curt Nemo, great article out on that.
[00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.562]  Bill Clinton, pauperize the populace to cure global warming.
[00:04:44.582 --> 00:04:46.424]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:48.926]  Absolutely jam-packed transmission.
[00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:55.286]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, ProofNews.us.
[00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:56.307]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:59.749]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:02.130]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:04.252]  A new world order.
[00:05:04.952 --> 00:05:09.195]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:12.016]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:12.677 --> 00:05:14.938]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:15.478 --> 00:05:17.860]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:25.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:28.982 --> 00:05:33.965]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:34.446 --> 00:05:37.928]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:40.810]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.011]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:42.811]  They're not after money.
[00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:43.872]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:44.853]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.093 --> 00:05:45.873]  That's what happens.

[00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:57.761]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.

[00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:01.720]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.065]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:08.566]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:07:08.847 --> 00:07:17.014]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:08:00.118 --> 00:08:06.020]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:32.169]  Before I launch into the news, I just want to thank my team, the InfoWarriors down here in the InfoWar bunker in Austin, Texas, Aaron Dyke, Craig Kincaid, Weldon Henson,
[00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:38.431]  Mike, Nelson, Amanda, Michelle, everybody, Ryan.
[00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:44.035]  I also want to thank the folks up at the network.
[00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:46.216]  Ted Anderson, of course, the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:46.677 --> 00:08:48.398]  The guy who just is the best board op.
[00:08:48.798 --> 00:08:49.579]  He's more than that.
[00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.400]  He just does so many great things.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.182]  You could call him the backup producer.
[00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:00.613]  The wild card producer, and that is John Harmon up there at the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:02.954]  I also want to thank all of our Aminathem affiliates.
[00:09:02.994 --> 00:09:13.600]  I want to thank all of our sponsors, all of our listeners, and I want to thank God for the guidance and protection and all the blessings that I've been given in my life.
[00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:18.443]  I need to pause more often and just thank the Lord above.
[00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:23.026]  I also just want to tell the listeners that we live on a beautiful planet.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.121]  Wonderful things are happening.
[00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:26.602]  Life is so transitory.
[00:09:26.622 --> 00:09:29.604]  We're almost like insects.
[00:09:29.724 --> 00:09:31.545]  Our life cycles are really so slow.
[00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:33.927]  I mean, go by so fast.
[00:09:36.729 --> 00:09:41.652]  It's just a real blessing to even exist and have consciousness.
[00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:56.473]  And to just have all these amazing wonders around us, and it's sad to me that so many people are depressed, so many people are unhappy with their lives, so many people feel insecure, so many individuals out there think that life is boring.
[00:09:56.694 --> 00:09:58.135]  Life is beautiful.
[00:09:58.916 --> 00:10:00.457]  Life is amazing.
[00:10:00.577 --> 00:10:02.379]  Life is dynamic.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.422]  Life is a wonderment.
[00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:07.383]  It is enchanted.
[00:10:08.078 --> 00:10:10.179]  And you need to see the magic in life.
[00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:12.961]  You need to see the beauty in life and appreciate it.
[00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:16.163]  Madison Avenue is there to make you feel inadequate.
[00:10:16.624 --> 00:10:19.325]  Madison Avenue is there to make you feel weak and pathetic.
[00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:32.474]  That's how their whole science started in the last 150 years, to then sell you the newest style each year as you throw out your whole wardrobe, to sell you all the skincare products, to sell you all the crud, or quote,
[00:10:34.585 --> 00:10:35.745]  You're not worth anything.
[00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:37.906]  Well, I'm here to tell you, you are worth something.
[00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:43.527]  And what does matter is family, and sovereignty, and freedom, and friends, and liberty.
[00:10:43.987 --> 00:10:44.888]  That's what matters.
[00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:51.930]  Not these phony plastic people that rule and dominate our society.
[00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.710]  They are a sickness.
[00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.050]  They are a cancer.
[00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.491]  So for anybody out there who feels inadequate or feels ugly,
[00:10:58.863 --> 00:11:03.766]  Or for anybody who's a few pounds overweight and the system tells you you're worthless, you do have value.
[00:11:04.106 --> 00:11:05.367]  What matters is your soul.
[00:11:05.687 --> 00:11:06.887]  What matters is your mind.
[00:11:07.108 --> 00:11:12.390]  What matters is what you build and the people you love and the people you take care of and the people that take care of you.
[00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:13.891]  That's what matters in life.
[00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:14.431]  Okay.
[00:11:16.473 --> 00:11:22.336]  I'll probably in the next few days do a more eloquent rant on that subject because it's really been touching my heart.
[00:11:22.676 --> 00:11:28.119]  Let me get into the news right now, encapsulate as much as I can before our first guest joins us.
[00:11:31.072 --> 00:11:33.854]  Let me just get into the Coulter situation first.
[00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:40.359]  Ann Coulter is a singularly disgusting person.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:48.065]  I've met her in person, seen her at the RNC convention in 2004, and I literally was stunned.
[00:11:48.086 --> 00:11:49.547]  I felt a presence of evil.
[00:11:49.707 --> 00:11:50.928]  I'm not kidding when I say this.
[00:11:51.608 --> 00:11:58.654]  And I turned, as I was there at the entrance, I'd already gone through three checkpoints, to Madison Square Garden, entering into the media entrance,
[00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:06.640]  And I thought that I was seeing like a concentration camp victim slash ringwraith.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.701]  She could barely walk.
[00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:13.464]  She was toddling on her legs with her arms out like a ghoul.
[00:12:13.604 --> 00:12:14.484]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:12:15.585 --> 00:12:20.068]  And as she was walking towards me, she had rouge on her cheeks.
[00:12:20.108 --> 00:12:22.489]  It was like a corpse and it had makeup put on it.
[00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.273]  And she had a gaggle of men in suits around her and she was literally
[00:12:29.336 --> 00:12:33.138]  Have you ever seen a concentration camp victim or somebody starving to death in Africa or Asia?
[00:12:33.158 --> 00:12:37.279]  You know, their joints start going out and they're having trouble walking.
[00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:39.500]  She looked, she was as anorexic as it gets.
[00:12:40.461 --> 00:12:46.923]  And then she just had these evil eyes stumbling forward, painted up like a corpse, like you'd paint up a corpse.
[00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:51.225]  And then she just gave me a leering smile and stumbled past me.
[00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.387]  Now, I don't normally go after people for how they look.
[00:12:58.163 --> 00:13:02.546]  But if you've seen Giuliani in person, he literally looks like an orc or a ghoul.
[00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:04.767]  He acts like one, of course, as well.
[00:13:06.048 --> 00:13:12.011]  He looks like the cross between a joker and the penguin, with a little mix of Nosferatu.
[00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.713]  Ann Coulter is the same way.
[00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:24.358]  I got the same evil from Janet Reno when I talked about how she ran the mass murder op at Waco to her face at the LBJ Presidential Library.
[00:13:25.039 --> 00:13:27.340]  By the way, that's in Police State 2, the takeover.
[00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:34.913]  And I brought up the murder of the children and she smiled like a demon and stuck her tongue out and was, you know, enjoying it.
[00:13:35.593 --> 00:13:37.534]  And I felt the palpable evil.
[00:13:38.655 --> 00:13:40.796]  I haven't had many of those experiences with these people.
[00:13:41.096 --> 00:13:42.116]  I've been around Bill Clinton.
[00:13:42.136 --> 00:13:43.997]  I didn't get the feeling of radiated evil.
[00:13:44.017 --> 00:13:47.939]  I've been around Bush and didn't feel that feeling of evil.
[00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:49.399]  I did his wife.
[00:13:49.499 --> 00:13:49.920]  I've met her.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.820]  I've been close, you know, face up to her.
[00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:53.281]  Back in 97, no, 96, I got into the
[00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:04.080]  Well, the radio station said, hey, we were given these passes to cover this film festival, the Governor's Film Festival.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:04.620]  Do you want to go?
[00:14:06.021 --> 00:14:06.841]  And I said, sure.
[00:14:06.921 --> 00:14:10.662]  So I took a camera guy down there, Dennis Hopper, and all these people were there.
[00:14:10.702 --> 00:14:13.122]  And there was Bush, and there was his wife.
[00:14:13.182 --> 00:14:15.323]  And I got the same look from her.
[00:14:15.383 --> 00:14:16.343]  And she came over and talked to me.
[00:14:17.943 --> 00:14:19.303]  But I wasn't as well-known then.
[00:14:19.323 --> 00:14:20.224]  They knew who I was.
[00:14:20.284 --> 00:14:21.344]  She asked me about the show.
[00:14:21.424 --> 00:14:25.265]  But she was, I guess, gauging to see if I was going to do anything.
[00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:27.025]  But, I mean, just radiating pure evil.
[00:14:28.319 --> 00:14:29.600]  You know what, I've already burned four minutes.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.761]  I better hurry up and just get to the news.
[00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:32.984]  I digress.
[00:14:33.324 --> 00:14:38.529]  But instead of just attacking Ann Coulter for how she looks, look at what she writes, the things she says.
[00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:39.850]  Let's put people in camps.
[00:14:40.251 --> 00:14:41.332]  Torture is good.
[00:14:41.672 --> 00:14:43.014]  Let's get rid of the Bill of Rights.
[00:14:43.134 --> 00:14:51.302]  I've debated her here, where she said the Patriot Act didn't say that they could go after citizens, and I'd read her the subsection, and she would just laugh at me.
[00:14:55.908 --> 00:14:57.909]  But Ann Coulter is an operative.
[00:14:57.969 --> 00:14:58.910]  There's no doubting that.
[00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.471]  And I've read several of her books.
[00:15:00.491 --> 00:15:02.052]  They're very sophomorically written.
[00:15:02.893 --> 00:15:05.134]  She is there to bind conservatives to her.
[00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:10.678]  She's there to sell them on the lie of neoconservatism and endless war and tyranny.
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.702]  But the reason this report is important is that
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:25.305]  We told you that Roger Ailes, going back now eight years, I keep saying four or five, years and years have passed, and I just keep using the same number.
[00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:45.820]  Since the election, since 2001, so that's like seven and a half years, it came out, I got sources in New York, then I saw a few blurbs confirming it, then I reported it, that Roger Ailes consults with Hillary, that they fundraise for, that they covertly supported her first campaign for Senate in 2000,
[00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:58.001]  Then, by about 2003, we were getting reports that every week he was having two, three, four-hour dinners with her at his penthouse, or at her penthouse.
[00:15:58.542 --> 00:15:59.502]  That's Rupert Murdoch.
[00:16:00.923 --> 00:16:06.507]  Then it came out the last two years, the White House has been helping write her speeches, has been advising her.
[00:16:08.088 --> 00:16:11.411]  Fox News started saying things like, well, Hillary's pretty good on the war.
[00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:12.471]  Well, she's not too bad.
[00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:14.373]  Well, let's get past politics.
[00:16:16.062 --> 00:16:20.245]  And then, of course, Scarborough on MSNBC is saying, hey, conservatives, stop attacking me.
[00:16:20.305 --> 00:16:21.085]  I like Hillary.
[00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:21.646]  She's tough.
[00:16:21.926 --> 00:16:22.526]  She's smart.
[00:16:23.087 --> 00:16:25.688]  I've heard Limbaugh saying little nice things about her.
[00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:28.150]  As bad as she is, she's better than Ron Paul.
[00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:31.612]  So I've seen the talking point accelerating.
[00:16:33.053 --> 00:16:40.638]  And now it's come out in the Dallas Observer and other New York papers that the White House wants her, is behind her.
[00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:41.739]  Well, we already know that.
[00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:44.501]  The Clintons and the Bushes go way back to when
[00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:46.345]  Bush Sr.
[00:16:46.385 --> 00:16:49.166]  recruited Clinton into CIA.
[00:16:50.026 --> 00:16:54.648]  One of the guys that E. Howard Hunt was handling at the time in 1968 was his handler.
[00:16:54.688 --> 00:16:55.868]  Those documents have come out.
[00:16:58.469 --> 00:16:59.589]  I'll have Jim Mars on about that.
[00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:00.010]  He's the expert.
[00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.070]  He actually has the documents.
[00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.531]  He was showing them to me in Dallas, but I was so busy getting JFK stuff, I forgot to videotape them.
[00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:07.552]  I'd always heard that, read that, seen that in books.
[00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:11.293]  Known that from Clinton, Bush, and the CIA by Terry Reid, CIA officer.
[00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:14.174]  By the way, works at WorldNet Daily.
[00:17:14.955 --> 00:17:15.956]  You never see stories about it.
[00:17:17.477 --> 00:17:28.007]  About how Clinton and Oliver North and all these people and Bush would come into Arkansas, how they were all in business together in narcotics and the CIA.
[00:17:28.287 --> 00:17:31.430]  I mean, these guys, this is a government operation.
[00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.150]  You understand that?
[00:17:33.992 --> 00:17:36.034]  And there's just thousands of other pieces of evidence.
[00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:43.855]  But I have said in the last two years, over and over again, I have said, you will see Fox News endorse Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:49.217]  You will hear Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity endorse Hillary Clinton.
[00:17:49.337 --> 00:18:04.482]  And you will have so-called conservatives, the guys that festoon their cars with Russia's rights stickers, because they're so invested in neoconism that they think it's conservatism, that they will rebuke us as liberals for being against Hillary.
[00:18:05.347 --> 00:18:08.991]  Now, I have said that hundreds of times, like a parrot.
[00:18:09.651 --> 00:18:12.574]  Ladies and gentlemen, ABC News.
[00:18:14.536 --> 00:18:19.261]  Reporting on Fox News, Coulter.
[00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:21.103]  I will vote for Hillary over McCain.
[00:18:21.503 --> 00:18:25.287]  In case you missed it on Hannity & Combs last night, controversial pundit Ann Coulter.
[00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:27.770]  By the way, she's a Fox News contributor.
[00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:36.373]  Who supports Mitt Romney for President, says she would back Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat in New York, over Senator John McCain, Republican in Arizona.
[00:18:37.493 --> 00:18:40.654]  She's more conservative than he is, she said.
[00:18:40.994 --> 00:18:42.835]  She will be stronger on the war on terrorism.
[00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:46.556]  I will campaign for her if it's McCain.
[00:18:46.576 --> 00:18:50.117]  Now McCain's saying, 100 year war, attack everybody, get ready for more wars.
[00:18:52.177 --> 00:18:58.159]  McCain's wife wears Hillary Clinton pins in this election and the last two elections, the last two that the Clintons were involved in.
[00:19:00.788 --> 00:19:04.091]  I mean this is in your face.
[00:19:06.072 --> 00:19:09.334]  The 92 election, the 96 election, and now this election.
[00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:17.781]  They openly, Bill Clinton, they played the clip on Meet the Press where he says, this is going to be totally friendly, we're family friends.
[00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:23.133]  So why would Ann Coulter be saying, oh, he's not pro-Warren, I'm for Hillary?
[00:19:23.253 --> 00:19:23.834]  Because it's true.
[00:19:23.934 --> 00:19:25.234]  Hillary is the anointed one.
[00:19:25.554 --> 00:19:27.115]  Fox News machinery is behind her.
[00:19:27.595 --> 00:19:29.276]  Just like the NRA is for gun control.
[00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:31.437]  You can't tell most NRA members that.
[00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:32.738]  It's just too big.
[00:19:33.438 --> 00:19:34.359]  You can't explain to them.
[00:19:34.579 --> 00:19:42.102]  But maybe this will wake them up, now that we have Ann Coulter coming out and saying, I support Hillary Clinton.
[00:19:42.683 --> 00:19:44.243]  She's conservative.
[00:19:44.564 --> 00:19:45.304]  She's good.
[00:19:46.565 --> 00:19:47.465]  You see how that works?
[00:19:48.266 --> 00:19:49.989]  And why are they being so open now about this?
[00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:52.532]  They're circling the wagons against the people.
[00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:54.155]  It's the elite against the people.
[00:19:54.395 --> 00:19:55.857]  It's not Republican or Democrat.
[00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:56.899]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:03.587]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:04.228 --> 00:20:13.138]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:13.619 --> 00:20:20.787]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:21.514 --> 00:20:26.977]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:20:39.065 --> 00:20:41.146]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:57.299 --> 00:21:02.063]  It is a big idea.
[00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:04.185]  A new world order.
[00:21:04.885 --> 00:21:08.989]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:11.531]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:21:11.731 --> 00:21:14.774]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:21:15.379 --> 00:21:17.822]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:18.563 --> 00:21:25.891]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:28.911 --> 00:21:33.894]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:37.857]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:38.217 --> 00:21:40.739]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:41.940]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.720]  They're not after money.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.801]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:44.001 --> 00:21:44.782]  They're after power.
[00:21:45.002 --> 00:21:46.263]  That's what they're after usually.

[00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:58.751]  You have been warned.
[00:21:59.811 --> 00:22:02.332]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:02.352 --> 00:22:09.393]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[00:22:10.133 --> 00:22:15.354]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[00:22:16.095 --> 00:22:27.877]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.

[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.884]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:23:05.024 --> 00:23:06.926]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:23:06.946 --> 00:23:10.230]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:16.036]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:23:16.337 --> 00:23:20.281]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:23:57.907 --> 00:23:59.267]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:02.429 --> 00:24:10.414]  I read the news today, oh boy.
[00:24:10.634 --> 00:24:12.235]  An atomic weapon had detonated.
[00:24:12.255 --> 00:24:14.877]  About a lucky man.
[00:24:15.908 --> 00:24:18.570]  But don't worry, the President Clinton will save us.
[00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:26.236]  And now the anti-war left once World War III.
[00:24:27.116 --> 00:24:29.498]  And we have to arrest all the evil gun owners.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:36.323]  And Fox News hails her.
[00:24:37.764 --> 00:24:40.806]  He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
[00:24:44.306 --> 00:24:50.670]  Get ready for all the neocons to worship Hillary.
[00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:58.475]  Prepare that if you don't support the Clintons, you're an evil communist.
[00:25:18.725 --> 00:25:27.011]  There's the elite prepared to install their little empress.
[00:25:30.653 --> 00:25:40.100]  Their little CIA linguist who revels and shows off detailing every regional accent no matter where she travels.
[00:25:41.962 --> 00:25:43.543]  Could be Kentucky, it could be London.
[00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:46.710]  It could be Seattle, it could be Texas.
[00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.832]  Isn't it nice to have government operatives staging elections, running everything?
[00:25:53.412 --> 00:25:55.193]  Getting ready to suck everything dry.
[00:25:56.974 --> 00:25:59.475]  Coulter, I will vote for Hillary over McCain.
[00:25:59.515 --> 00:26:04.857]  We'll get more into this later and actually read our disgusting quotes about how good Hillary is.
[00:26:06.437 --> 00:26:07.678]  Let's see, because it's from Coulter.
[00:26:08.558 --> 00:26:12.900]  Oh, I guess Hillary's good now, because Coulter's such a good conservative.
[00:26:13.846 --> 00:26:23.269]  Her books are so sophomoric about torture and secret arrest, and Malkin writes books, The Case for Internment Camps, and Woolsey's behind McCain.
[00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:30.412]  We've been down to a Woolsey event here at UT called The New World Order was the lecture where he spoke for an hour about putting people in camps in America.
[00:26:30.432 --> 00:26:35.514]  Yeah, they're just openly selling us on absolute total martial law.
[00:26:37.695 --> 00:26:41.456]  They're not doing it because they're not planning to try it.
[00:26:42.438 --> 00:26:52.920]  I think we're going to let Bush fade out, fade into a deep recession, and then Hillary will come in with an inaugural terror attack, and we'll all go, and some people question, could a woman do it?
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.500]  But then the terrorist hit us, and hit us hard.
[00:26:56.921 --> 00:26:59.381]  And after that, the country learned to love her.
[00:27:00.321 --> 00:27:02.522]  She became like a mother to the nation.
[00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:08.643]  She held strongly with enemies, and didn't allow dissent, because the country had been so badly damaged.
[00:27:09.122 --> 00:27:13.283]  And in just two short years, brought us out of depression, into an incredible boom time.
[00:27:14.243 --> 00:27:20.484]  By dollarizing North America, she brought the dollar back up, made alliances with Europe, and invaded the Middle East.
[00:27:21.004 --> 00:27:26.285]  Hillary Clinton, who would have ever thought, once hated by conservatives, is now loved by her.
[00:27:26.725 --> 00:27:29.266]  Photos of her hang in most conservatives' houses.
[00:27:29.946 --> 00:27:31.226]  We love you, Hillary.
[00:27:32.586 --> 00:27:37.787]  Sure, she's arrested hundreds of thousands of Americans, and put them in labor camps, but they should have to work.
[00:27:38.484 --> 00:27:42.427]  You know, we shouldn't have to pay for them in those camps, as Michael Savage has laid the groundwork for.
[00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:50.934]  Michael Wiener, the top beatnik in the 60s, who wrote about love affairs with friends, love novels.
[00:27:51.514 --> 00:27:52.715]  Find out about the friends.
[00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:55.317]  Find out about who he wrote love novels about.
[00:27:55.337 --> 00:27:58.340]  Oh, it's so conservative.
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.241]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:03.224]  It makes me so sick, you scum!
[00:28:04.338 --> 00:28:09.562]  In fact, I got this clip of Woolsey I never played from two days ago, where he was going, John McCain wants everybody's support.
[00:28:10.003 --> 00:28:11.204]  Even Trotskyites.
[00:28:11.564 --> 00:28:13.646]  And his eyes light up like a devil.
[00:28:13.666 --> 00:28:15.667]  Boy, that guy just radiates evil.
[00:28:15.687 --> 00:28:16.488]  He's another one of them.
[00:28:17.949 --> 00:28:19.170]  It was a little inside joke.
[00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.892]  He smacked and giggled and his eyes lit up.
[00:28:22.793 --> 00:28:29.939]  Because the Communist Fourth International is the entire skeletal workings of what the neocons are.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.201]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:28:33.092 --> 00:28:34.813]  I'm not saying they're communist.
[00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:38.897]  They use any vehicle for absolute power.
[00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:43.120]  Stalin, black uniforms, mass arrests, huge slave camps.
[00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:47.984]  Hitler, black uniforms, mass arrests, huge slave camps, invading nations.
[00:28:48.044 --> 00:28:48.505]  Same thing.
[00:28:48.765 --> 00:28:54.129]  Mao, black uniforms, giant slave camps, invading Tibet, surrounding areas.
[00:28:56.431 --> 00:29:00.875]  Always the same, they come in the black uniform with the black masks.
[00:29:01.846 --> 00:29:04.228]  But now the toys sold everywhere for children.
[00:29:04.768 --> 00:29:08.471]  Little boys fantasizing about being heroes for the tribe.
[00:29:08.731 --> 00:29:09.092]  Normal.
[00:29:09.532 --> 00:29:10.072]  Instinctive.
[00:29:10.413 --> 00:29:15.456]  They learned that the good guys have mean faces and show their teeth and wear black masks.
[00:29:16.097 --> 00:29:17.698]  Don't you understand, police officers?
[00:29:17.738 --> 00:29:18.579]  You grew up with that.
[00:29:18.779 --> 00:29:20.060]  That's why you like it now.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.121]  You're living your dream.
[00:29:24.503 --> 00:29:25.984]  You're living the dream!
[00:29:26.585 --> 00:29:28.426]  And let me just tell you, you're gonna get to live it.
[00:29:29.347 --> 00:29:30.568]  You're gonna live in squalor.
[00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:37.076]  You're gonna have the enemy carry out the same bio-weapons attacks they've carried out on Africa on you.
[00:29:37.856 --> 00:29:41.880]  You smirked and laughed, now you get to have a taste of it.
[00:29:43.141 --> 00:29:48.786]  That's the one bit of solace I have, that you will reap what you sow.
[00:29:50.807 --> 00:29:53.810]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.433]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.447 --> 00:30:06.090]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:11.432]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:30:11.712 --> 00:30:16.795]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of disease.
[00:30:17.095 --> 00:30:18.856]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[00:30:19.116 --> 00:30:22.678]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[00:30:22.998 --> 00:30:28.980]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.762]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[00:30:33.002 --> 00:30:37.544]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[00:30:37.824 --> 00:30:38.604]  Do your part.
[00:30:38.864 --> 00:30:41.125]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[00:30:41.485 --> 00:30:47.608]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[00:30:47.928 --> 00:30:50.330]  Up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:56.874]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[00:30:57.174 --> 00:30:58.575]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.572]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:31:01.913 --> 00:31:07.417]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:31:07.898 --> 00:31:15.844]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:31:16.345 --> 00:31:19.968]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs.
[00:31:20.228 --> 00:31:20.588]  I think so.
[00:31:50.194 --> 00:31:53.876]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:31:53.916 --> 00:31:55.537]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:32:00.163 --> 00:32:03.867]  This is George Whiters-Ferry of the Genesis Communications Network.
[00:32:04.107 --> 00:32:06.389]  Have you ever wanted the truth about the economy?
[00:32:06.689 --> 00:32:07.150]  Crash!
[00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:08.130]  Are You Ready?
[00:32:08.571 --> 00:32:11.453]  is the fastest-growing program on GCN.
[00:32:11.754 --> 00:32:16.778]  Our one-hour program airs weekdays, Monday through Friday, from 10 to 11 a.m.
[00:32:16.959 --> 00:32:21.543]  Central Time, just after the Power Hour and just before Alex Jones.
[00:32:21.963 --> 00:32:31.650]  To listen to rebroadcast 24 and 7, visit our website at www.hereatonline.com and click on the appropriate link.
[00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:45.839]  Our unparalleled guest lineup has included patriots such as Congressman Ron Paul, Scott Ritter, former UN Chief Weapons Inspector Murray Neal, inventor of the revolutionary dragon skin body armor, and Philip Torme, USS Liberty survivor.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.342]  We also focus on alternative health and survival topics,
[00:32:49.702 --> 00:32:53.224]  Go to www.hearonline.com.
[00:32:53.584 --> 00:32:58.927]  That's H-E-A-R-I-T-O-N-L-I-N-E dot com.
[00:33:02.229 --> 00:33:02.689]  Good evening.
[00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:07.392]  I would like to report on the state of our war against the American people.
[00:33:07.772 --> 00:33:18.938]  We're mounting a sustained campaign to crack down on every American and every person of every faith in every nation.
[00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:21.799]  And to bring them to justice.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:29.102]  All missions are being executed according to plan, without warning or provocation.
[00:33:29.122 --> 00:33:35.145]  Americans are being swept up in an international dragnet.
[00:33:35.185 --> 00:33:38.406]  Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other citizens in their inner world.
[00:33:39.607 --> 00:33:43.088]  It has everything to do with hate and evil, and murder and prejudice.
[00:33:43.428 --> 00:33:44.649]  America is strong.
[00:33:49.028 --> 00:33:51.011]  The man's going to be joining us, Harris.
[00:33:51.692 --> 00:33:55.496]  More than 4 million records sold, CDs sold.
[00:33:55.516 --> 00:33:57.799]  And I think he's got the anthem.
[00:33:57.819 --> 00:34:03.025]  I think he's got the most powerful hip-hop, anti-Beast, anti-New Order song out there.
[00:34:03.366 --> 00:34:05.048]  Here it is, and we're going to the man.
[00:34:05.288 --> 00:34:05.829]  Stay with us!
[00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:29.575]  I think.
[00:34:59.295 --> 00:34:59.616]  We're good.
[00:35:32.501 --> 00:35:35.003]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[00:35:35.063 --> 00:35:37.645]  Around eleven motherfuckers couldn't stand his name.
[00:35:37.845 --> 00:35:40.527]  Hey, his waving flags like they lost their mind.
[00:35:40.587 --> 00:35:42.908]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[00:35:43.128 --> 00:35:45.570]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:50.533]  The oldest trick in the book is make your enemy a phony evil so the government can do its dirt.
[00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:53.115]  And take away your freedom, lock and load, beat and search.
[00:35:53.195 --> 00:35:55.917]  Ain't nothing changed, but more colored people locked in prison.
[00:35:55.977 --> 00:35:57.298]  These pigs still beat us, but it's
[00:35:57.478 --> 00:36:01.040]  Seems we forgetting, but I remember 4 September how these devils do it.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.741]  F*** Giuliani, ask Diallo how he's doing.
[00:36:03.842 --> 00:36:05.823]  We in the streets, holler jail to the feet.
[00:36:05.903 --> 00:36:08.624]  Follow f*** waving flags, bring these dragons to their knees.
[00:36:08.924 --> 00:36:11.166]  Oil, blood, money make these killers ride cold.
[00:36:11.306 --> 00:36:13.927]  Suspicious suicide, people dying never told.
[00:36:14.327 --> 00:36:16.729]  It's all a part of playing God, so you think we need him?
[00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:19.630]  Walk in, ass crossed, take away your rights to freedom.
[00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.991]  Bail witness to the sickness of these dictators.
[00:36:22.252 --> 00:36:24.553]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cause it's major.
[00:36:25.532 --> 00:36:28.674]  I hope you understand the time, brother, because it's major.
[00:36:28.694 --> 00:36:39.319]  Paris, it is a real honor after all these years marveling at your wonderful artistry to have you on the broadcast with us.
[00:36:39.699 --> 00:36:45.542]  And I don't think of any song out there that's three and a half minutes long that tells as much of the story
[00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:50.275]  Uh, as that particular song, but I love all of your music.
[00:36:50.315 --> 00:36:51.076]  It's great to have you here.
[00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:52.178]  I appreciate it, man.
[00:36:52.198 --> 00:36:52.919]  It's good to be here.
[00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:54.642]  Thanks for your ongoing support, too.
[00:36:54.662 --> 00:36:56.064]  I know this has been a long time coming.
[00:36:56.645 --> 00:37:00.010]  That song was actually inspired by Road to Tyranny, believe it or not, so...
[00:37:01.405 --> 00:37:02.445]  Yeah, I'm coming full circle.
[00:37:03.426 --> 00:37:09.689]  Well, we're honored to have you, and just a little bit about yourself, a little bit about some of the music that you've come out with lately.
[00:37:09.709 --> 00:37:11.649]  We're going to play some of that coming up.
[00:37:11.849 --> 00:37:16.251]  Also, the website, the organization, you also put out other people's great music and other artists.
[00:37:16.752 --> 00:37:22.154]  Break that down for us, and then let's get into your political view of what's happening in the world today.
[00:37:22.414 --> 00:37:22.694]  Okay.
[00:37:22.854 --> 00:37:27.596]  Well, I've been basically doing music since 89, at my first
[00:37:30.293 --> 00:37:33.416]  My first album came out when I was still in college.
[00:37:33.756 --> 00:37:35.798]  Actually, it came out in June of 1990.
[00:37:35.898 --> 00:37:38.200]  I mean, excuse me, in April of 1990.
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.121]  And I graduated in June of 1990.
[00:37:40.161 --> 00:37:41.763]  When I graduated, it was top ten.
[00:37:41.823 --> 00:37:45.566]  So, I pretty much had a job getting out of school and never looked back.
[00:37:45.646 --> 00:37:48.588]  So, let me see.
[00:37:48.649 --> 00:37:50.130]  Been doing it all this time.
[00:37:51.511 --> 00:37:55.214]  Was briefly a tech analyst for a major broker dealer.
[00:37:55.254 --> 00:37:57.396]  I went to college for managerial economics.
[00:37:59.056 --> 00:38:06.763]  I was a full-fledged investment banker for a minute, and that funded my ability to be able to do what I do independently.
[00:38:09.165 --> 00:38:12.047]  Right after 9-11, I was reinvigorated.
[00:38:12.087 --> 00:38:15.029]  I came out with an album called Sonic G-Odd in 2003.
[00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:22.255]  What Would You Do, the song that you just played, is featured on Sonic G-Odd.
[00:38:23.456 --> 00:38:26.299]  I've just seen this kind of groundswell of support.
[00:38:27.051 --> 00:38:29.052]  Tell us about the website.
[00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:55.033]  They don't want a strong, hardcore political message, do they?
[00:38:55.053 --> 00:38:58.396]  They just want to show people with a bunch of bling acting silly.
[00:38:59.216 --> 00:39:00.117]  Across all genres.
[00:39:00.717 --> 00:39:01.118]  Exactly.
[00:39:01.198 --> 00:39:02.418]  It's not specific to hip-hop.
[00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:05.240]  Oh, it's rock and roll, it's country, it's everything.
[00:39:05.421 --> 00:39:08.903]  Everything is escapist right now.
[00:39:09.283 --> 00:39:13.206]  Well, when Willie Nelson came out and criticized the war, they cut back on playing his music.
[00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:15.288]  The Dixie Chicks tried to do something serious.
[00:39:15.308 --> 00:39:16.629]  They tried to shut them down.
[00:39:17.754 --> 00:39:19.354]  Yep, pretty much across the board.
[00:39:19.654 --> 00:39:21.555]  I mean, it's still in effect.
[00:39:22.055 --> 00:39:23.675]  Bruce Springsteen did not too long ago.
[00:39:24.055 --> 00:39:24.755]  Same situation.
[00:39:25.616 --> 00:39:32.097]  So it became apparent to me that I had to be as independent as possible and set it up.
[00:39:32.337 --> 00:39:37.398]  And GorillaFunk.com is the site that reflects everything that's going on with Gorilla Funk.
[00:39:37.438 --> 00:39:38.958]  And there's a huge subscriber base.
[00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:43.279]  And, you know, there are similar parallels to what you have going on with InfoWars.
[00:39:43.319 --> 00:39:46.060]  So, again, it makes sense for us to collab.
[00:39:46.764 --> 00:39:49.406]  Absolutely, and it's a great honor to be collaborating with you, sir.
[00:39:50.046 --> 00:39:51.887]  Let's talk about your awakening.
[00:39:51.907 --> 00:39:57.431]  I mean, obviously, you've got a lot of anger, but it's also focused, you know, a lot of righteous indignation.
[00:39:57.451 --> 00:40:00.693]  I mean, it really cuts through as totally real.
[00:40:01.153 --> 00:40:06.236]  What was your metamorphosis, or growing up, what were things that you saw, or you saw the injustice?
[00:40:06.276 --> 00:40:09.518]  When did you learn that AIDS was engineered, now completely documented?
[00:40:09.759 --> 00:40:12.140]  When did you wake up to government-sponsored terror?
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.361]  I mean, tell us about Paris himself.
[00:40:15.602 --> 00:40:16.982]  All of it comes from independent reading.
[00:40:17.562 --> 00:40:19.423]  You know, nothing that I learned in school.
[00:40:19.503 --> 00:40:25.264]  I graduated, like I said, from college in 1990 completely oblivious to what was really going on.
[00:40:25.524 --> 00:40:30.585]  I mean, you know, I had been prepared for a job to work for somebody else.
[00:40:31.185 --> 00:40:43.508]  I had no real conscious awareness, and it was only really as a result of hearing it in other people's music and having that be the catalyst to maybe want to learn more, you know?
[00:40:44.668 --> 00:40:50.392]  I come up in an era when I first started in hip-hop, there was much more diversity in the message.
[00:40:51.633 --> 00:40:58.077]  And honestly, negativity was an exception to the rule when I came out, and now it's exactly the opposite.
[00:40:59.178 --> 00:41:06.583]  And, you know, just after doing a lot of independent research and reading on my own, that was really it, you know.
[00:41:06.623 --> 00:41:12.747]  And then, of course, traveling around the world on these tours, seeing the impact that we have had on other societies.
[00:41:13.506 --> 00:41:26.250]  And seeing how other people live and what other people believe, you know, I honestly believe that a lot of ignorance can be erased by people just being exposed to more, by people going out, by people seeing and interacting with other people, you know.
[00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.510]  Here's your tax dollars at work, you know.
[00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.431]  See this devastation.
[00:41:30.671 --> 00:41:40.554]  And, you know, I can now completely subscribe to the notion that nothing significant happens on the world stage that isn't completely predetermined.
[00:41:41.187 --> 00:41:43.068]  Not elections, not wars, nothing.
[00:41:43.448 --> 00:41:55.674]  You know, the concept of manufactured enemy creation is one, I mean, I know that you've echoed this sentiment too, is one that's tried and true at this point, and it's been proven to be successful over time.
[00:41:55.794 --> 00:41:59.136]  Well, Roosevelt said that nothing happened by accident.
[00:41:59.556 --> 00:41:59.776]  Right.
[00:42:00.697 --> 00:42:01.497]  That's absolutely right.
[00:42:02.138 --> 00:42:03.178]  And that's on record.
[00:42:03.198 --> 00:42:06.240]  That's, I mean, any big, you know, huge event that they
[00:42:07.188 --> 00:42:09.649]  I was trading or getting ready to begin trading, believe it or not.
[00:42:09.669 --> 00:42:12.170]  I actually did all of my training in the World Trade Center.
[00:42:37.372 --> 00:42:49.720]  That's what I went to school for, and that's, you know, I always kind of got into the financial markets with this objective of kind of having this Robin Hood type of mentality, you know, and it enabled me to get low-income housing and stuff like that out here.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.722]  I'm based in the Bay Area in California.
[00:42:52.382 --> 00:42:58.026]  So, you know, to a certain extent, I achieved my objectives, but I was getting ready to start trading.
[00:42:58.887 --> 00:43:04.030]  And, you know, on the West Coast, of course, it's much earlier for us when the financial markets open.
[00:43:05.607 --> 00:43:07.268]  So you wake up about five in the morning every day?
[00:43:07.789 --> 00:43:12.031]  Yeah, well even earlier than that sometimes because I have overseas distributors that I have to deal with.
[00:43:12.071 --> 00:43:19.194]  So if I have to talk to Japan or France or something, I'm up pretty much all the time.
[00:43:20.195 --> 00:43:29.880]  So I was getting ready to start trading and that's how the planes hit and I got the phone calls and I was trying to reach people that I knew that actually
[00:43:30.578 --> 00:43:31.718]  We're good to go!
[00:43:56.161 --> 00:44:01.265]  You know, I think a lot of people thought it was an accident, it was a tragedy, and then the second plane hit and all of a sudden the game changed.
[00:44:02.186 --> 00:44:06.710]  And it took me a minute to process it because I don't really, I'm not really a rush to judgment kind of guy.
[00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:15.777]  But, you know, knowing what I know of our treacherous history, it wasn't a stretch for me to be able to put that together.
[00:44:15.997 --> 00:44:21.322]  And then I began to see all the postings online and I began to, you know, digest the information that I learned about
[00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:22.510]  I don't think so.
[00:44:51.724 --> 00:44:56.905]  This current race right now with this election and this whole thing is amazing to me.
[00:44:57.846 --> 00:45:00.087]  How short people's memories are.
[00:45:00.827 --> 00:45:01.387]  It's amazing.
[00:45:01.427 --> 00:45:08.930]  You know, you look at what we've gained, you know, from this past administration and what we've lost.
[00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:14.372]  You know, the erosion of our global clout and this climate of fear, this ruling by fear.
[00:45:14.892 --> 00:45:15.672]  Everything that's happened.
[00:45:16.432 --> 00:45:18.353]  Compromised media reporting.
[00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:29.905]  Immigration scapegoating, racial intolerance, religious intolerance, you know, housing meltdown, recession, higher gas prices, greater reduction in funding for social programs.
[00:45:30.345 --> 00:45:32.306]  I mean, nothing is good right now.
[00:45:33.006 --> 00:45:42.349]  You know, and then you have these diversionary kind of arguments about, you know, abortion rights, gay marriage, stuff like that, which really does not affect most people.
[00:45:44.159 --> 00:45:49.984]  And again, not getting on either side of that, what you're saying is that it's a football issue.
[00:45:50.004 --> 00:45:51.465]  They're never going to resolve that.
[00:45:51.785 --> 00:45:53.467]  They just use it as a way to divide us.
[00:45:54.047 --> 00:45:54.427]  Exactly.
[00:45:55.028 --> 00:45:55.448]  Exactly.
[00:45:55.949 --> 00:46:09.900]  You know, but then you look at the war profiteering, and you look at, you know, imminent domain seizures, domestic spying, and all this, you know, all these things are in effect, and the effect of them have been ramped up as a result of post
[00:46:10.942 --> 00:46:14.523]  We're talking to Paris, more than 4 million records sold, and that's his label.
[00:46:15.023 --> 00:46:16.343]  It's GorillaFunk.com.
[00:46:17.104 --> 00:46:20.804]  Again, sir, I don't want to sit here and grovel to you.
[00:46:20.904 --> 00:46:21.365]  I'm not.
[00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:26.726]  I just want to tell you that I feel, and there's very few people I feel this with, a kindred spirit.
[00:46:26.746 --> 00:46:30.127]  Because people get mad at me sometimes because I get so angry and I grind my teeth.
[00:46:30.767 --> 00:46:31.467]  But you talk about
[00:46:32.333 --> 00:46:34.194]  Spitting cyanide each and every verse.
[00:46:34.474 --> 00:46:36.295]  These people are killers, we're talking about.
[00:46:36.535 --> 00:46:37.455]  They're murdering us.
[00:46:37.595 --> 00:46:40.517]  The least we can do is just get enraged at them.
[00:46:40.917 --> 00:46:42.378]  People say, oh no, be easy about it.
[00:46:42.438 --> 00:46:47.860]  No, we need to get mad first, like Howard Beals says in Network, and then that's when things start changing.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.481]  We need to realize this is everything.
[00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:50.181]  This is our life.
[00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:54.043]  We're under attack, and as much attack as I've been under, as much attack as I've seen
[00:46:54.663 --> 00:47:00.650]  White people being under, it's nothing, and I'm not saying this because you're black, it's what I talk about on the show, as you know, it's the truth.
[00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.152]  Black people are under the greatest attack of any group.
[00:47:03.352 --> 00:47:12.342]  They've had everything tested on them, like Tony Brown says first, and I understand what's done to, somebody else is going to end up happening to me at an instinctive level.
[00:47:12.782 --> 00:47:15.065]  I am outraged by what I've seen done to
[00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:26.033]  Black people, Africans, whatever you want to, you know, human beings, I mean, can you speak to being a black American, what it's like growing up in this system and your anger there?
[00:47:26.393 --> 00:47:32.315]  Well, I mean, you can see the statistics, it's pretty much self-explanatory at this point.
[00:47:32.755 --> 00:47:44.299]  I mean, we've only gone to war with a country, we've gone to war with countries of color pretty much non-stop since World War II.
[00:47:45.151 --> 00:47:47.572]  Yeah, except for the, with the exception probably of Kosovo.
[00:47:47.872 --> 00:47:54.475]  And, and you see every time there's violence visited on people, it's the country of color.
[00:47:54.555 --> 00:48:00.738]  You see it here, you see it domestically, you see with Katrina, you see it with, you know, economics and education.
[00:48:00.818 --> 00:48:09.482]  And, you know, I don't, there's a huge amount of blame that can be placed on society the way it currently exists and on policies and the way they affect people.
[00:48:10.327 --> 00:48:19.030]  But I'm also of the mind of kind of a self-healing within my own community and to make people realize that we really can't rely on anybody else.
[00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:22.112]  You know, you've got to step up to the plate and you've got to do it for yourself also.
[00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:25.473]  So, you know, it's a two-pronged approach as far as I'm concerned.
[00:48:25.493 --> 00:48:30.255]  Well, I agree with that, but when I read Margaret Sanger, the eugenicist,
[00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:36.752]  You know, saying we can't let the black weeds know that we want to exterminate them and how they went and hired black leaders to be their fronts.
[00:48:38.053 --> 00:48:41.635]  Again, they always take a disadvantaged community and test on them.
[00:48:41.655 --> 00:48:43.735]  But there are no black leaders.
[00:48:44.636 --> 00:48:45.476]  Keep that in mind, too.
[00:48:45.496 --> 00:48:51.539]  And especially when you look at, you know, like a lot of people in the black community, a lot of their guidance comes from the church.
[00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:56.001]  And the church is, for the most part, GOP sponsored at this point, you know.
[00:48:57.757 --> 00:49:01.680]  You can always find somebody that's willing to sell out their people and their ideals for the right amount of money.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.561]  And that goes across all color lines.
[00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:05.623]  Exactly.
[00:49:05.683 --> 00:49:06.924]  They control all the leaders.
[00:49:06.984 --> 00:49:07.724]  They have them all.
[00:49:07.804 --> 00:49:13.148]  I mean, every major political candidate, except for Ron Paul, and they're twisting and demonizing and spinning him.
[00:49:15.373 --> 00:49:21.939]  Every major political candidate, except for maybe Dennis Kucinich, and he's dropped out on the Democratic side, and they totally ignored him.
[00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.482]  That's how they control us, is they control the leaders.
[00:49:24.842 --> 00:49:29.846]  So here we are, with basically an oligarchy type of a situation.
[00:49:30.227 --> 00:49:34.010]  You know, just Bushes and Clintons since, what, 88?
[00:49:35.131 --> 00:49:35.672]  Absolutely.
[00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.614]  You know, so it'll be different.
[00:49:39.075 --> 00:49:41.097]  And more importantly, do our votes really count anyway?
[00:49:42.051 --> 00:49:43.812]  Well, we're demonstrating that it's a fraud now.
[00:49:43.912 --> 00:49:48.514]  It's certainly that most of the countries, and you look at these companies, they're all intelligence agency fronts.
[00:49:49.035 --> 00:49:52.296]  But with Diebold in the mix, you know, it can be argued that both don't count.
[00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:57.419]  I mean, it appears to me that everything is a game to most people.
[00:49:57.539 --> 00:50:00.741]  They don't take conditions seriously anyway.
[00:50:02.342 --> 00:50:10.546]  I think the only way to truly enact change and policy that's fair to people is for our leaders to fear us physically.
[00:50:12.515 --> 00:50:16.078]  Now that, now, you see what kind of cars you get after that statement, but it's true.
[00:50:16.498 --> 00:50:18.820]  The government is supposed to fear the people, not the other way around.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.282]  Well, that's what the Founding Fathers said.
[00:50:20.302 --> 00:50:22.223]  When the government fears the people, you have liberty.
[00:50:22.423 --> 00:50:24.185]  When the people fear the government, you have tyranny.
[00:50:25.206 --> 00:50:25.566]  There you go.
[00:50:26.967 --> 00:50:27.708]  I agree with you, Paris.
[00:50:27.728 --> 00:50:37.076]  I want to come back and talk more about your label, more about your political awakening, and your ideas of getting real leaders to the fore and getting individuals to be individual leaders in their areas.
[00:50:37.976 --> 00:50:38.477]  It's guerrilla.
[00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:40.502]  We're good to go.
[00:51:00.692 --> 00:51:03.253]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:51:03.553 --> 00:51:04.854]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[00:51:05.114 --> 00:51:07.115]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:51:07.275 --> 00:51:09.016]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.

[00:51:47.468 --> 00:51:48.009]  It's a fact.
[00:51:48.029 --> 00:51:53.473]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:51:53.533 --> 00:51:58.618]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically
[00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.850]  I'm good.
[00:52:34.657 --> 00:52:39.679]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.

[00:52:59.978 --> 00:53:00.478]  Hi, Ken.
[00:53:00.518 --> 00:53:01.298]  It's Judy again.
[00:53:01.318 --> 00:53:05.839]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:09.120]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:11.240]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.581]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[00:53:13.761 --> 00:53:19.882]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[00:53:20.062 --> 00:53:25.363]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[00:53:25.623 --> 00:53:28.484]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[00:53:28.604 --> 00:53:29.524]  Go KenSolar!
[00:53:30.845 --> 00:53:32.365]  Get the best of both worlds.

[00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:09.013]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:12.555]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:18.433 --> 00:54:19.634]  This is a short segment.
[00:54:19.854 --> 00:54:22.197]  Paris is going to be with us for about 20 after next hour.
[00:54:22.217 --> 00:54:25.660]  We're going to play Sheep to the Slaughter that Names Names and AWOL.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.303]  So much stuff is happening during the breaks here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:29.644 --> 00:54:30.564]  So much is moving.
[00:54:30.605 --> 00:54:31.605]  It's that flashpoint.
[00:54:32.546 --> 00:54:35.910]  Times in history when more happens in a month than happens in 10 years.
[00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.433]  And Paris, I mean, I've got to give credit where credit is due.
[00:54:40.206 --> 00:54:51.509]  You came out with, what would you do, 2001, 2002, I forget the date, and it was so hardcore, really before any other artist in any genre had the nerve to come out and do it.
[00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:54.390]  I mean, did you have to take a deep breath before you did that?
[00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:59.151]  Or, I get the idea, you're the type of guy that once you made the decision, you weren't even worried about it.
[00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:02.592]  Yeah, the decision was pretty much made and stuck with.
[00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:07.894]  I mean, I got a lot of heat behind that song, and I got a lot even more heat with the album cover, which is
[00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:09.170]  We're good to go.
[00:55:35.644 --> 00:55:40.125]  Again, I've been fired off radio stations, I've been censored, and I've done it.
[00:55:40.185 --> 00:55:46.808]  Most people I know, Parris, even if they talk a good game in this, quote, movement of liberty, they will turn in a minute for money.
[00:55:46.988 --> 00:55:47.468]  Without a doubt.
[00:55:47.648 --> 00:55:48.608]  You didn't do that, though.
[00:55:48.668 --> 00:55:48.868]  No.
[00:55:49.148 --> 00:55:49.328]  No.
[00:55:50.049 --> 00:55:50.229]  No.
[00:55:51.129 --> 00:55:52.029]  I mean, it's not worth doing.
[00:55:52.669 --> 00:55:54.390]  I mean, I can go make records for
[00:55:55.586 --> 00:55:56.387]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:56:11.198 --> 00:56:14.740]  Well, for the first time since Sonic G.I., that'll be out, I think, in June.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.121]  Well, you just said it.
[00:56:16.741 --> 00:56:18.382]  For me, I can't sell out.
[00:56:18.562 --> 00:56:20.183]  I couldn't even think about selling out.
[00:56:20.203 --> 00:56:21.864]  People say, well, are you going to sell out?
[00:56:21.884 --> 00:56:23.204]  And I'm like, how do I do that?
[00:56:23.224 --> 00:56:24.305]  This is who I am.
[00:56:24.325 --> 00:56:28.607]  And you basically just said the same thing, that, hey, this is who I am.
[00:56:28.647 --> 00:56:29.908]  There's not even a discussion of this.
[00:56:31.148 --> 00:56:39.993]  What kills me the most is, and I know this has probably happened to you, is people say that you're capitalizing off of people's misery by doing what you do.
[00:56:41.227 --> 00:56:50.371]  And really we're commentating on what's happening and there are no bigger beneficiaries of misery than the government.
[00:56:50.571 --> 00:56:51.912]  We're trying to stop the misery.
[00:56:51.932 --> 00:56:53.732]  They're the ones that capitalized on it.
[00:56:53.752 --> 00:56:55.733]  Their own memos, their own PNAC memo says it.
[00:56:56.013 --> 00:57:00.335]  And if I really wanted to cash in, I'd be making music like 50 Cent or something.
[00:57:00.355 --> 00:57:01.316]  So, there it is.
[00:57:02.436 --> 00:57:04.557]  Well, I think you've got the best voice.
[00:57:05.197 --> 00:57:07.978]  You could probably do James Earl Jones voiceovers.
[00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:09.439]  Hey, hey, Lucas, call me.
[00:57:12.401 --> 00:57:12.761]  Thank you.
[00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:13.801]  Oh, man.
[00:57:14.222 --> 00:57:19.003]  I tell you, Parris, again, I really do feel, and I'm showing you personally, that we're kindred spirits.
[00:57:19.704 --> 00:57:34.329]  Yeah, I mean, you know, and the funny thing is I'm pretty left-leaning, you know, but I can find common ground with just about anybody as long as logic is employed, you know, and it just seems like that's something that I don't encounter that much.
[00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:39.271]  I think people are so emotional and so reactionary nowadays that they can't, you know, we live in an era where
[00:57:39.881 --> 00:57:41.281]  People believe what they want to believe.
[00:57:42.162 --> 00:57:44.722]  You know, the truth can be as plain as the nose on your face.
[00:57:45.262 --> 00:57:49.343]  Even on TV, you know, in those rare moments where TV is actually truthful.
[00:57:50.283 --> 00:57:52.324]  And they still gravitate toward what they want to believe.
[00:57:52.404 --> 00:57:54.725]  Now, that's another key point that you just raised.
[00:57:55.525 --> 00:58:01.706]  And that is that people, especially these yuppies, they think they can choose what the reality is and that that makes it that way.
[00:58:01.746 --> 00:58:02.646]  No, that's not how it works.
[00:58:03.107 --> 00:58:03.307]  Right.
[00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:04.307]  That's true.
[00:58:05.247 --> 00:58:05.687]  That's true.
[00:58:06.107 --> 00:58:09.288]  You know, again, if you believe as I do that everything is predetermined, then
[00:58:09.889 --> 00:58:11.390]  You know, we're pretty much along for the ride.
[00:58:13.071 --> 00:58:17.314]  Well, that's what Karl Rove at that cocktail party told the Washington Post and the New York Times reporters.
[00:58:17.595 --> 00:58:18.936]  He said, hey, we're history's actors.
[00:58:18.976 --> 00:58:19.896]  You're just spectators.
[00:58:20.197 --> 00:58:21.177]  We run the whole show.
[00:58:21.217 --> 00:58:22.158]  We decide everything.
[00:58:22.678 --> 00:58:27.642]  But I'm here to tell Karl Rove and Bill Clinton and the rest of them, we're taking the system back.
[00:58:27.702 --> 00:58:29.884]  And I see that happening at an explosive level.
[00:58:30.364 --> 00:58:31.185]  His name's Paris.
[00:58:31.225 --> 00:58:33.927]  He's sold more than four million albums.
[00:58:34.587 --> 00:58:38.170]  We're going to be right back after this 72nd break with this icon.
[00:58:42.307 --> 00:58:45.268]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.548 --> 00:58:47.888]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:48.248 --> 00:59:00.251]  What's wrong, Mommy?
[00:59:00.431 --> 00:59:02.372]  People are upset about some things, darling.
[00:59:03.012 --> 00:59:04.272]  Why are they yelling?
[00:59:04.612 --> 00:59:05.452]  They want attention.
[00:59:05.472 --> 00:59:08.413]  They're trying to get attention so that people will listen to them.
[00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:21.660]  It's our way of trying to get some media attention because they are ignoring us, they're ignoring the anti-war movement, they're ignoring the anti-government movement.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.343]  We love our country, but we cannot trust our government anymore.
[00:59:25.783 --> 00:59:28.726]  Our government is totally out of control.
[00:59:33.869 --> 00:59:35.050]  That's what it's coming down to.
[00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:36.111]  Do you believe your neighbors?
[00:59:36.452 --> 00:59:38.834]  Do you believe the people that live in your hometown?
[00:59:39.335 --> 00:59:42.798]  Or do you believe these mad dog killers in Washington D.C.?
[00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:55.111]  Are we setting up a situation where young people who are just starting to come of age are going to have no choice but to either join the military where there seems to be a lot of money or to go to jail where there seems to be a lot of money?
[00:59:55.752 --> 00:59:56.913]  Is that what this is lining up to be?
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:01:05.722]  The microphone in this land of jokes Can't leave it alone, cause you know I can see right through Corrupt plans in these bullshit scams and untruths We living in a maze, different days and times The world is a stage, most truth is a lie In this propaganda matrix, the sheep just die So these murderous conservatives with corporate ties Deny knowledge of the truth Ignoring the poor, they just human ammunition
[01:01:05.822 --> 01:01:06.823]  We're good to go.
[01:01:37.853 --> 01:01:39.474]  No, they ain't supportin' dissent.
[01:01:39.554 --> 01:01:44.799]  Never Blair, Kid Rocker, Tom Cruise or Bowser, James Woods, Rob Lowe, Tom Selleck or Powell.
[01:01:44.819 --> 01:01:46.320]  Not Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.283]  He ain't gon' shoot a Ted Nugent, cause in war, targets got weapons too.
[01:01:50.423 --> 01:01:57.249]  Ain't Cheney, Rumsfeld, Halliburton or Ridge, or Ann Coulter or Joseph Lieberman or the Rich, or any bish up in Congress.
[01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:58.270]  They just make laws.
[01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:00.992]  When it come to fightin', we the ones that end up in gauze.
[01:02:01.012 --> 01:02:03.674]  So when you say support that murderer, I have no applause.
[01:02:03.915 --> 01:02:06.657]  Even if he got his jumpsuit on, we pay the cost.
[01:02:08.693 --> 01:02:10.094]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:02:10.354 --> 01:02:12.274]  Sheep to the Slaughter by Paris.
[01:02:12.935 --> 01:02:22.959]  And tell us, Paris, because we're about to go to break, come back with a long segment, final segment with you, and I want to have you back again, if you'll grace us, with some of the new CDs, some of the MP3s that are out.
[01:02:22.999 --> 01:02:23.619]  How people get them?
[01:02:24.939 --> 01:02:30.882]  Well, most of the material, believe it or not, is available in stores, but if you want to get it directly from Gorilla Funk, you can.
[01:02:30.902 --> 01:02:34.983]  The website address is www.gorillafunk.com.
[01:02:35.163 --> 01:02:37.084]  Doesn't matter how you spell Gorilla, you'll still get there.
[01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:42.772]  Either after a gorilla or after a gorilla fighter, two different spellings.
[01:02:42.852 --> 01:02:45.092]  Either way you spell it, Gorillafunk.com.
[01:02:45.272 --> 01:02:45.953]  Right, that's it.
[01:02:46.233 --> 01:02:46.653]  You got it.
[01:02:46.793 --> 01:02:48.473]  Tell us about some of the newest albums.
[01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:51.574]  Well, the new album, my new album is called Acid Reflex.
[01:02:51.794 --> 01:02:55.135]  It'll be out probably in June at this point.
[01:02:55.155 --> 01:02:56.715]  I think I'm going to have to push it back a couple weeks.
[01:02:56.955 --> 01:03:01.856]  You know, these release dates come in two week increments and you have to deliver about a quarter early.
[01:03:02.496 --> 01:03:03.296]  I know how it is.
[01:03:03.396 --> 01:03:04.436]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:04.557 --> 01:03:06.757]  So that, then I have a
[01:03:07.623 --> 01:03:13.044]  Um, new albums by Cam, who's a West Coast artist, who's fiercely politically conscious.
[01:03:13.305 --> 01:03:14.325]  Same thing with T. Cash.
[01:03:14.365 --> 01:03:15.265]  I have George Clinton.
[01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:16.265]  I have a record with Eric.
[01:03:16.965 --> 01:03:21.207]  Um, proposed arrangement with Erykah Badu that I think is going to come to fruition.
[01:03:21.967 --> 01:03:26.588]  And, um, a lot of different films in the works also, so... Oh, films!
[01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:28.148]  I want to hear about that, or can you talk about it?
[01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:30.809]  Oh, well, you know, it's just independent documentaries right now.
[01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:32.489]  We have one called Sounds Like a Revolution.
[01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:34.410]  It looks like it's going to be a theatrical release.
[01:03:35.337 --> 01:03:37.600]  And a lot of people involved with that.
[01:03:38.561 --> 01:03:41.185]  The Dixie Chicks, Delaware Opera.
[01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.167]  Wow, stay there, stay there.
[01:03:43.588 --> 01:03:45.410]  The battle is joined.
[01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:47.813]  Ferris, take an action.
[01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:48.654]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:52.876 --> 01:04:00.820]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.422]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:04:52.466 --> 01:04:58.110]  Now that we are in the midst of the presidential primaries, Republican candidate Ron Paul needs our support more than ever.
[01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:04.494]  Ron Paul stands for the issues that need to be addressed and not glossed over and forgotten like the globalist crowd being fielded.
[01:05:04.855 --> 01:05:11.219]  Unlike other candidates, Ron Paul takes a stand to follow what our forefathers envisioned America to be through the Constitution.
[01:05:11.479 --> 01:05:18.304]  Dr. Paul will restore sound money, eliminate the IRS, prevent the NAU, get us back to our constitutional roots.
[01:05:18.604 --> 01:05:19.244]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.071 --> 01:05:45.052]  About Ron Paul.
[01:05:45.392 --> 01:05:46.772]  This is our chance, America.
[01:05:47.033 --> 01:05:47.613]  Stand up.
[01:05:47.993 --> 01:05:49.274]  Now is the time to act.
[01:05:52.115 --> 01:06:04.861]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:12.005]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[01:06:12.365 --> 01:06:15.908]  And the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:06:42.205 --> 01:06:44.166]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.600]  We're talking to Parris.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.881]  He's producing films.
[01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:16.982]  He's producing head after head with some of the biggest artists out there in multiple genres.
[01:07:18.142 --> 01:07:24.324]  And he's got some of the most powerful hip-hop slash spoken word, whatever you want to call it, pieces I've ever seen.
[01:07:25.484 --> 01:07:27.105]  And this is our final segment with him.
[01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:30.346]  I'm going to twist his arm, get him back on with us in the near future.
[01:07:30.366 --> 01:07:35.567]  We're going to have some other big guests coming up too in the next week, God willing.
[01:07:36.447 --> 01:07:37.588]  Parris, I want to play
[01:07:39.232 --> 01:07:40.254]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:07:50.288 --> 01:07:52.148]  I didn't ask you this question, let me ask you on the air.
[01:07:52.808 --> 01:08:02.910]  Is it because the internet and alternative distribution systems like the ones you've created that have been so successful, now forcing the big universals to cave in to alternative information?
[01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:16.713]  Because now my videos are in Blockbuster and Hollywood Video, nothing compared to what you're doing, but I've even seen my stuff break through now, and I've talked to some of the big corporate guys, and they're all, yeah, we know it's true, we know the New World Order's running everything, yeah, yeah, we're trying to sneak your stuff in.
[01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:21.534]  So, it seems like that the facade is starting to collapse.
[01:08:22.394 --> 01:08:24.694]  Well, yeah, it's definitely collapsing.
[01:08:24.995 --> 01:08:32.356]  But I think that, you know, just from a financial standpoint, I think they're really attracted to business models that make sense right now.
[01:08:32.436 --> 01:08:40.698]  You know, so if you have an operation with really low overhead, you know, you can sell a lot of volume and, you know, you can deliver fairly consistently, I think that that's something that they're attracted to.
[01:08:43.533 --> 01:08:44.214]  We're good to go.
[01:09:11.536 --> 01:09:15.439]  Being in blockbuster for your movies is the equivalent of being on Clear Channel for music.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.481]  It's amazing this is starting to happen.
[01:09:18.541 --> 01:09:20.302]  What do you think the establishment is going to do?
[01:09:20.342 --> 01:09:21.703]  They're clearly getting desperate.
[01:09:21.723 --> 01:09:26.346]  They're admitting in Pentagon and Ministry of Defense reports that the people aren't buying the propaganda.
[01:09:26.686 --> 01:09:31.430]  The new British Ministry of Defense report openly says the elite may have to wage war against the people.
[01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:35.953]  They're shifting the military-industrial complex apparatus fully over the people now.
[01:09:37.393 --> 01:09:38.074]  Your take on that?
[01:09:38.624 --> 01:09:42.967]  Well, you know, the military-industrial complex and the prison-industrial complex, I mean, they're working in tandem.
[01:09:44.828 --> 01:09:56.915]  You're absolutely right about people waking up and becoming more aware, and that is directly attributable to counter-establishment, popular media, like what we create, and to the Internet.
[01:09:57.675 --> 01:10:00.677]  I mean, the Internet really is a great equalizer of information.
[01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:04.599]  You can find out pretty much whatever you want to know about anything on the Internet.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:07.700]  I don't know what they can do.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.081]  I mean, I don't know what they can do, honestly.
[01:10:32.172 --> 01:10:34.894]  I think the cat is out of the bag.
[01:10:35.095 --> 01:10:36.736]  Pandora's box is open, I agree.
[01:10:36.916 --> 01:10:37.176]  Yeah.
[01:10:39.498 --> 01:10:41.560]  Tell us about AWOL.
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.082]  AWOL is another song off of Sonic G.I.
[01:10:45.102 --> 01:11:00.895]  which is my last record, which is a first person narrative of a high school student who encounters military recruiting on campus and all of the lies that they tell him and everything that he goes through and he ends up going for it.
[01:11:01.798 --> 01:11:03.899]  And, uh, you know, to a sad end.
[01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.940]  So, it's pretty self-explanatory once you hear it.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.821]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:08.921 --> 01:11:11.122]  AWOL by Paris from Sonic Jihad.
[01:11:12.342 --> 01:11:17.525]  And you don't hear none of those stations for hip-hop and R&B playing them.
[01:11:17.625 --> 01:11:18.405]  Ask why?
[01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:21.506]  In fact, where are those stations today?
[01:11:22.507 --> 01:11:24.167]  Somebody better ask somebody that.
[01:11:24.607 --> 01:11:30.330]  The people that's most affected by this war are the so-called hip-hop generations.
[01:11:33.325 --> 01:11:35.467]  The Army is the best-kept secret in the world.
[01:11:35.487 --> 01:11:40.611]  And every soldier gets his or her own private room.
[01:11:40.932 --> 01:11:44.975]  Do you forget that old brown boot image of the Army?
[01:11:46.992 --> 01:11:49.334]  Good job, like anything else.
[01:11:49.374 --> 01:11:50.976]  Good luck and have a safe trip.
[01:11:51.096 --> 01:11:52.517]  I remember how it started.
[01:11:52.677 --> 01:11:53.558]  Remember the time.
[01:11:53.798 --> 01:11:56.220]  I was watching Rap City about a quarter to nine.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.862]  Commercial said the military giving money for school.
[01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:00.404]  Caught the punks up to my campus.
[01:12:00.444 --> 01:12:03.026]  They were signing recruits and then this dude named Diablo.
[01:12:03.046 --> 01:12:03.286]  Hello.
[01:12:03.326 --> 01:12:04.227]  He was some kind of vet.
[01:12:04.307 --> 01:12:04.507]  I see.
[01:12:04.547 --> 01:12:05.708]  He explained the situation.
[01:12:05.728 --> 01:12:07.149]  Told me what to expect instead.
[01:12:07.169 --> 01:12:09.591]  Now I'll help you pay for college and train you for work.
[01:12:09.611 --> 01:12:12.193]  Said I could take computer classes and could quit if I want.
[01:12:12.234 --> 01:12:14.876]  But best of all was the fact that I'd have my own street.
[01:12:15.396 --> 01:12:17.759]  I have my own space and have my own place to kick it.
[01:12:17.819 --> 01:12:20.342]  On top of that, I travel and visit the world.
[01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:23.966]  Held Diablos, hit the women overseas, was a pearl, didn't even call my girl.
[01:12:23.986 --> 01:12:25.708]  Let's get it on for sure.
[01:12:25.728 --> 01:12:28.251]  Saw my name, took some tests, and I was out of the door.
[01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:30.854]  A true soldier for America, ready to go.
[01:12:31.134 --> 01:12:33.637]  On the road to vacation, I'll be good for the soul.
[01:12:37.315 --> 01:12:38.156]  We're good to go.
[01:12:57.783 --> 01:13:00.405]  If I didn't know no better, I think Boyd was my name.
[01:13:00.425 --> 01:13:02.727]  Same bulls**t flying so many bids for me.
[01:13:03.108 --> 01:13:05.590]  Got another twisted up in this illusion of freedom.
[01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.412]  I'm out tomorrow, made up my mind.
[01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:10.934]  Everything Diablo said I'm finding out was a lie.
[01:13:10.954 --> 01:13:12.435]  That's when my unit got the call.
[01:13:12.475 --> 01:13:13.736]  The Commander-in-Chief.
[01:13:13.817 --> 01:13:16.199]  On the ground, troop assignments keeping peace in the East.
[01:13:16.279 --> 01:13:17.199]  What a relief!
[01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:18.741]  I'm thinking finally something new.
[01:13:19.101 --> 01:13:21.763]  Ships us off and 20 hours later we was en route.
[01:13:21.803 --> 01:13:23.625]  Touchdown around 11, the desert was through.
[01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:24.586]  We're good to go.
[01:13:58.829 --> 01:13:59.470]  I think so.
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.441]  We're good to go.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.180]  I think.
[01:15:05.757 --> 01:15:07.057]  It's more than video games.
[01:15:07.097 --> 01:15:08.598]  The government developed the video games.
[01:15:08.658 --> 01:15:10.378]  The military makes video games.
[01:15:10.398 --> 01:15:11.638]  They issue them to the children.
[01:15:11.798 --> 01:15:17.119]  And I assure you, for all the zit-faced kids out there, when you get there, you're going to find out that it's not a joke.
[01:15:17.159 --> 01:15:17.979]  It's not a game.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:19.940]  It's very, very sad.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:25.541]  I tell you, Parrish, you are doing so much societally, socially, spiritually for society.
[01:15:25.741 --> 01:15:28.862]  And what are they going to do now that they're not getting enough recruits?
[01:15:28.922 --> 01:15:31.222]  They're not even getting enough illegal aliens to be recruits.
[01:15:31.922 --> 01:15:34.003]  It looks like they want to give us a draft, don't they?
[01:15:34.623 --> 01:15:35.263]  I've heard that.
[01:15:35.996 --> 01:15:38.503]  Being floated around for a while now.
[01:15:39.305 --> 01:15:39.786]  We'll see.
[01:15:40.308 --> 01:15:41.230]  We're definitely going to see.
[01:15:42.794 --> 01:15:44.439]  It's a sad, sad state of affairs.
[01:15:45.154 --> 01:15:51.459]  Well, those are all amazing songs, and even better ones, I think, on some of the other albums are all just excellent.
[01:15:51.719 --> 01:15:57.663]  We've got a few minutes left, Parris, and again, I want to invite you back up any time again, GorillaFunk.com.
[01:15:58.624 --> 01:16:00.565]  In the last few minutes we've got, you've got the floor.
[01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:06.049]  Any other key points or things you want to express to the audience, all the fans and supporters you've got out there?
[01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:10.292]  Well, that's one thing that I wanted to acknowledge, is the supporters.
[01:16:10.572 --> 01:16:12.934]  I never say fans, but I definitely appreciate the support.
[01:16:14.622 --> 01:16:27.392]  You know, encourage people to support counter-establishment media and to support independent media and independent art, like what Alex is doing, like, you know, like what you're doing and like what I'm doing.
[01:16:27.973 --> 01:16:31.776]  And I want to say thanks to all the many people that are on MySpace.
[01:16:31.936 --> 01:16:40.723]  You know, MySpace has been a huge thing for me as well as GorillaFunk.com and to Jonathan Black for hosting this interview and, you know, to you and Trey and Aaron and everything.
[01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:41.544]  I appreciate it, really.
[01:16:42.705 --> 01:16:47.529]  In closing, I know you talked to a lot of other famous people, celebrities, artists.
[01:16:47.749 --> 01:16:48.690]  I talked to quite a few.
[01:16:50.111 --> 01:16:52.493]  Going back years, they knew 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:16:52.513 --> 01:16:55.515]  They knew that we were going into tyranny, but they were scared to speak out like you did.
[01:16:56.556 --> 01:17:01.780]  How many people do you talk to, I mean, who are well-known, that know the truth, but are scared to go public?
[01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:07.284]  You know what it is, especially in hip-hop, man, it seems like nobody knows anything.
[01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:10.907]  I don't encourage anybody to speak out on things that they don't know.
[01:17:11.556 --> 01:17:17.198]  You know, it's like, you know, you even look worse when you have an opinion and you're not knowledgeable.
[01:17:17.618 --> 01:17:29.762]  So I encourage everybody to do more independent reading, more independent research, you know, to become more exposed and to travel if you can, if you're of means to be able to travel and go places and experience things that other people are going through.
[01:17:29.782 --> 01:17:38.805]  You'll have a much clearer idea of what's going on in the world and how our situation in America adversely affects everybody else.
[01:17:40.839 --> 01:17:42.140]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:17:42.481 --> 01:17:45.343]  And people always ask me about solutions.
[01:17:45.423 --> 01:17:46.484]  Just getting the word out.
[01:17:46.865 --> 01:17:48.686]  The general public is still not educated.
[01:17:48.887 --> 01:17:50.008]  They know something's wrong now.
[01:17:50.048 --> 01:17:50.748]  That's the first step.
[01:17:50.969 --> 01:17:53.851]  But education, education, getting informed, that's the key.
[01:17:54.172 --> 01:17:56.514]  But the TV is the great miseducator.
[01:17:57.094 --> 01:18:01.238]  And, you know, it's like people seem to be alerted to reading now.
[01:18:01.879 --> 01:18:06.083]  And when people go to school, a lot of times if they just go by the book and
[01:18:07.158 --> 01:18:10.800]  And don't explore things on their own, and they'll only be equipped to work for somebody else.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:17.643]  And you know, and there's no incentive for anybody to see you become knowledgeable.
[01:18:18.464 --> 01:18:19.144]  Understand that.
[01:18:19.284 --> 01:18:21.585]  You know, there's no incentive for them to see you know anything.
[01:18:22.005 --> 01:18:23.926]  You know, somebody has to work at Walmart, right?
[01:18:23.986 --> 01:18:27.448]  So we just keep fighting this fight.
[01:18:29.193 --> 01:18:30.654]  Well, you're amazing, my friend.
[01:18:30.714 --> 01:18:31.956]  Paris, we salute you.
[01:18:32.096 --> 01:18:32.836]  Go with God.
[01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.299]  And I'll talk to you during the break, if you can hold there.
[01:18:36.339 --> 01:18:38.441]  But I just want to thank you for spending time with us, sir.
[01:18:38.661 --> 01:18:39.762]  Alex, thanks for having me, man.
[01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:41.364]  I'm looking forward to coming back.
[01:18:41.784 --> 01:18:44.066]  Well, I'm very honored that Roderick Tierney influenced you.
[01:18:44.747 --> 01:18:45.688]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:18:46.648 --> 01:18:47.089]  Alright, folks.
[01:18:47.129 --> 01:18:48.350]  We'll be back with a bunch of news.
[01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:49.531]  Ron Paul campaign.
[01:18:52.714 --> 01:18:54.115]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.196 --> 01:18:56.197]  A new world order.
[01:18:56.943 --> 01:19:01.127]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:01.828 --> 01:19:03.589]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:06.892]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:19:07.433 --> 01:19:09.895]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:10.636 --> 01:19:17.962]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:20.968 --> 01:19:25.950]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:29.892]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:30.272 --> 01:19:32.793]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:33.833]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:33.853 --> 01:19:34.714]  They're not after money.
[01:19:34.734 --> 01:19:35.834]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:36.074 --> 01:19:36.915]  They're after power.
[01:19:37.055 --> 01:19:38.075]  That's what they're after.

[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.741]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:56.984]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:57.224 --> 01:22:01.867]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:22:02.207 --> 01:22:04.829]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:22:05.089 --> 01:22:09.973]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:22:10.173 --> 01:22:11.954]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:12.154 --> 01:22:17.879]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:22:18.159 --> 01:22:19.840]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:24.124]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:22:24.584 --> 01:22:35.593]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[01:22:35.974 --> 01:22:41.038]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:22:41.278 --> 01:22:44.301]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[01:22:44.541 --> 01:22:44.981]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:22:47.183 --> 01:22:50.326]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1 today!
[01:22:50.346 --> 01:23:01.514]  I think this song says it all.
[01:23:01.534 --> 01:23:06.838]  Keep your eyes on the line, darlin'.
[01:23:06.878 --> 01:23:09.200]  Don't let it show.
[01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:10.981]  Pretend.
[01:23:15.012 --> 01:23:22.468]  Keep you in the dark till the sun went down again.
[01:24:03.512 --> 01:24:05.734]  We're good to go.
[01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:46.456]  So I'm told, I'm just another soul to fail.
[01:24:47.898 --> 01:24:48.599]  Oh well.
[01:24:48.639 --> 01:24:56.187]  The truth is I love men, but you're not gonna get there.
[01:24:56.267 --> 01:24:58.629]  Simple men, simple men.
[01:25:03.699 --> 01:25:06.202]  We're good to go.
[01:25:32.886 --> 01:25:33.446]  Yeah!
[01:25:34.166 --> 01:25:39.787]  I'm the voice inside your head, you can't see me.
[01:25:39.887 --> 01:25:46.208]  I'm the face that you have to face, I'm bigger than your face.
[01:25:46.689 --> 01:25:51.209]  I'm what's left, I'm what's right, I'm the enemy.
[01:25:51.349 --> 01:25:56.890]  I'm the one that can take you down, if you choose your means.
[01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:58.851]  So who are you?
[01:26:11.197 --> 01:26:11.718]  Yeah.
[01:26:20.349 --> 01:26:24.633]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[01:26:24.673 --> 01:26:29.016]  What if I say I'm not just another one in your place?
[01:26:29.056 --> 01:26:32.579]  Gonna pretend, girl What if I say I will never surrender?
[01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.841]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[01:26:34.901 --> 01:26:37.603]  What if I say I'm not just another one in your place?
[01:26:37.623 --> 01:26:41.085]  Gonna pretend, girl What if I say I will never surrender?
[01:26:45.026 --> 01:26:45.506]  We're good.
[01:27:17.617 --> 01:27:19.278]  Well, that's high-powered, isn't it?
[01:27:19.298 --> 01:27:40.626]  Alright, we're scheduled to have the Ron Paul 2008 campaign, uh, head of the campaign, Kent Snyder, popping in, and I got a bunch of other news, and we're gonna have, uh, Mr. Grudy, Paul Grudy, he was the head of the Funeral Home, and they, uh, basically ordered him to stage the fingerprints of Lee Harvey Oswald onto the supposed shooter gun, the Mandela Kick Carcano, back in 1963.
[01:27:44.116 --> 01:27:45.816]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not playing games.
[01:27:45.836 --> 01:27:47.157]  We're bringing you the eyewitnesses.
[01:27:47.177 --> 01:27:49.157]  We're bringing you the deathbed confessions.
[01:27:49.177 --> 01:27:51.078]  We're bringing you the facts.
[01:27:51.838 --> 01:27:53.938]  We're bringing you the info war, 110%.
[01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:58.820]  We're not fighting the New World Order to lose.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.440]  We got God on our side.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.761]  And if we lose, we die, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:03.781 --> 01:28:09.282]  They can continue to carry out their bioethicist operations, their eugenics upon us.
[01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:12.003]  This isn't a drill.
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.161]  This isn't a game.
[01:28:14.981 --> 01:28:16.142]  You're only alive once.
[01:28:17.483 --> 01:28:23.186]  This is Mortal Kombat, toe-to-toe, with the NWO and their Dark Lord.
[01:28:24.607 --> 01:28:26.448]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:27.229 --> 01:28:28.970]  I am your wartime broadcaster.
[01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:33.553]  Global transmission continues right after this quick break.
[01:28:34.113 --> 01:28:34.854]  Keep it locked in.
[01:28:42.825 --> 01:28:45.828]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.748 --> 01:28:49.451]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:45.162 --> 01:29:48.404]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[01:29:48.584 --> 01:29:49.665]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[01:30:02.299 --> 01:30:06.741]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[01:30:07.081 --> 01:30:09.182]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[01:30:09.522 --> 01:30:11.683]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[01:30:11.963 --> 01:30:14.885]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[01:30:16.905 --> 01:30:18.986]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:24.709]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[01:30:26.634 --> 01:30:31.177]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:35.199]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:30:36.059 --> 01:30:40.942]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[01:30:41.002 --> 01:30:45.224]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:30:45.484 --> 01:30:47.625]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[01:30:47.725 --> 01:30:48.506]  Go to hempusa.org.
[01:30:52.426 --> 01:30:55.367]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:30:55.527 --> 01:31:00.688]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:31:01.048 --> 01:31:06.349]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:06.749 --> 01:31:07.870]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:17.232]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:31:17.312 --> 01:31:17.532]  Yes.
[01:31:17.552 --> 01:31:19.174]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[01:31:19.394 --> 01:31:23.579]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.181]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:31:57.367 --> 01:31:59.268]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:59.769 --> 01:32:02.670]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:13.777 --> 01:32:15.438]  Man, I am so excited right now.
[01:32:16.919 --> 01:32:18.140]  We just talked to Willie Nelson.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.520]  Probably gonna have him on the show soon.
[01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.342]  Ha ha!
[01:32:21.362 --> 01:32:22.562]  That is exciting!
[01:32:24.263 --> 01:32:26.845]  And we just had Paris on.
[01:32:27.825 --> 01:32:35.871]  We got Paul Gritty, the funeral director, who was ordered by the government to put Lee Harvey Oswald's prints on the Madden-Clerk Arcana rifle.
[01:32:36.492 --> 01:32:37.392]  He lives here in Austin.
[01:32:38.033 --> 01:32:40.315]  We've got him about to be in studio coming up in the next hour.
[01:32:40.335 --> 01:32:45.959]  Ron Paul 2008 campaign, it has been just amazing.
[01:32:45.979 --> 01:32:48.961]  There's another money bomb going on today.
[01:32:49.041 --> 01:32:50.963]  Two million raised a week or so ago.
[01:32:52.205 --> 01:33:01.379]  And we are joined by Kent Schneider of the RonPaul2008.com campaign to give us an overview of where we're going and what's happening coming up in the Super Tuesday.
[01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:03.463]  Mr. Schneider, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:33:06.672 --> 01:33:07.813]  There's so much to talk about.
[01:33:07.853 --> 01:33:10.414]  What is most important to impart to the listeners right now, sir?
[01:33:10.894 --> 01:33:14.156]  Well, you mentioned Super Tuesday, and that's really the showdown of Super Tuesday.
[01:33:14.196 --> 01:33:33.785]  I know the Super Bowl is on Sunday, but the real important game is on the following Tuesday, and we'd certainly encourage people today and all through the weekend to sign up for Precinct Cleaners, get their friends to get out and vote, and there's, what, 20-22 states, so the big showdown is on Tuesday to donate if you can.
[01:33:34.266 --> 01:33:44.192]  So we can get more television and radio out there, but a whole year's worth of effort is really coming down to Tuesday, and here's our opportunity to take a stand.
[01:33:46.073 --> 01:33:54.899]  Now, I know you guys want to look forward instead of backwards, and I want to do that today and talk about your strategy, because the listeners obviously want to know, Mr. Schneider.
[01:33:55.399 --> 01:34:03.204]  But going back, I mean, New Hampshire, now Bev Harris, who helped produce the HBO documentary, she says there is clear fraud and quote, criminal operation.
[01:34:04.164 --> 01:34:04.644]  We're good to go.
[01:34:33.476 --> 01:34:38.640]  Well, we have, we reserved our right, as far as Louisiana, reserved our right to file a lawsuit down there.
[01:34:39.361 --> 01:34:42.603]  We're actually going to be making a decision about that in the next day or two.
[01:34:43.644 --> 01:34:45.966]  You know, Dr. Paul did have a statement in terms of New Hampshire.
[01:34:46.387 --> 01:34:54.593]  I mean, there's no doubt that elections, there's problems in terms of what degree, of course, you'd have to go through each individual situation.
[01:34:54.613 --> 01:35:00.418]  As far as the media bias, you know, you and I have talked about this before, and of course that was never more evident.
[01:35:00.894 --> 01:35:20.859]  In the latest debate, the CNN broadcast at the Reagan Library in terms of the time that Dr. Paul got and even Huckabee got, or didn't get is probably a better way of putting it, but there's no doubt that the establishment is pulling out the stops to make sure that the Ron Paul campaign and all the people who support him are silenced or ignored or aware of that.
[01:35:20.879 --> 01:35:24.300]  You know, unfortunately for us, we have a campaign to run.
[01:35:24.833 --> 01:35:31.078]  And it's very difficult when you get into this legal mud, as I call it, of various jurisdictions around the country.
[01:35:31.499 --> 01:35:36.763]  It's very, very difficult for us to run a full-fledged campaign at the same time.
[01:35:38.334 --> 01:35:54.750]  I totally understand, and I think the listeners do, because you spend all your money, all your time, all your energy fighting those instead of looking forward and dealing with the next battle to come.
[01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:58.013]  But I want listeners and Ron Paul supporters to take heart, which they are.
[01:35:58.613 --> 01:36:02.440]  Because this massive blackout we're seeing and this attempt, I wouldn't even call it bias.
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:08.189]  I mean, when they give him a third the time the other candidates get, less than a third, the questions, when they...
[01:36:08.968 --> 01:36:10.269]  That's not bias, that's cheating.
[01:36:10.309 --> 01:36:32.740]  It's like having a horse race that's ten laps, and you give the other guy six laps, you know, head start, or in an Indy 500, Ron's got to wait two hours after the race starts to even be able to get his car out there, and that shows the establishment is scared, but the good news is alternative media has gotten the word out that he got second place in two major states.
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:34.001]  No, you're right.
[01:36:34.981 --> 01:36:45.951]  Thankfully for shows like yours and of course the internet and all the websites and the blogs and all the email traffic, people around the country, in fact different parts of the world, they keep the truth going.
[01:36:46.711 --> 01:36:50.995]  Dr. Paul has said many, many times that it wasn't for the internet and the so-called alternative radio.
[01:36:51.417 --> 01:36:56.823]  Talk shows, broadcasts, as well as via the internet, this whole effort wouldn't be what it is today.
[01:36:56.883 --> 01:36:59.245]  So that's a big thank you to all those people.
[01:36:59.545 --> 01:37:04.170]  Well, now is the time to redouble and retriple our efforts, regardless of what happens in this election.
[01:37:04.210 --> 01:37:07.533]  As the Congressman has said, we're educating people who would have ever thought we'd see
[01:37:08.695 --> 01:37:12.959]  MSNBC talking about the private criminal Federal Reserve and how there's a need for investigations.
[01:37:13.239 --> 01:37:15.662]  Who would have ever thought we'd see Ron Paul on Jay Leno twice?
[01:37:15.942 --> 01:37:22.990]  Who would have ever thought that Liberty's message, I see Ron Paul sticker signs, phone calls, it's just the buzz is everywhere that's clearly they're cheating.
[01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:24.952]  I mean there's no doubt on its face I know that's happening.
[01:37:25.152 --> 01:37:26.533]  People say then why keep running?
[01:37:26.614 --> 01:37:27.835]  Why keep canvassing?
[01:37:28.155 --> 01:37:33.158]  Because they don't cheat everywhere, they don't have control everywhere, and we're going to prove the system has problems.
[01:37:33.178 --> 01:37:37.941]  You have to engage the corrupt system to later be able to prove that all of that is happening.
[01:37:37.981 --> 01:37:39.642]  That's now developing.
[01:37:39.702 --> 01:37:42.904]  Everybody needs to continue to give money to RonPaul2008.com.
[01:37:42.924 --> 01:37:48.067]  Let's talk about what we can do in the four days, five days leading up to Super Tuesday, then into California.
[01:37:48.648 --> 01:37:53.071]  Well, my biggest suggestion for people is, again, to become a precinct leader.
[01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:54.191]  Do that on RonPaul2008.com.
[01:37:55.692 --> 01:37:58.054]  Make a donation so we can keep the ads going.
[01:37:58.394 --> 01:38:10.544]  But the third thing is, and this is overlooked time and time again, is people should, you know, invite, encourage, urge, push, whatever words you want, five, ten people of friends and family to do the same thing.
[01:38:10.604 --> 01:38:12.105]  I mean, just imagine, do the math.
[01:38:12.465 --> 01:38:18.570]  I mean, let's say we have a million people out there actively doing, you know, becoming a pre-seq leader and we've got people donating money.
[01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:23.674]  If every one of those people would just get three people just to do the very same thing that they did,
[01:38:24.079 --> 01:38:24.439]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:38:46.061 --> 01:38:52.487]  Kent, the congressman said six months ago that he probably wouldn't run on third party because the machinery isn't there.
[01:38:52.507 --> 01:38:54.229]  I agree with that at that time.
[01:38:54.909 --> 01:39:00.995]  And obviously, we can't even start talking about third party runs until we see what happens in Super Tuesday and after that.
[01:39:02.116 --> 01:39:08.141]  But now, in some of the debates and some of the interviews, he said, well, I never really thought about it, but now there's such interest.
[01:39:09.641 --> 01:39:14.923]  He said things similar to that, you know, that well now, you know, maybe, but right now, you know, I'm running as a Republican.
[01:39:14.943 --> 01:39:16.303]  I'm not trying to put words in his mouth.
[01:39:16.323 --> 01:39:19.904]  I don't have the exact quotes there, but you've heard him, Ken Schneider, head of the campaign.
[01:39:21.025 --> 01:39:28.587]  I don't want to put the cart before the horse here, but as a way to buoy people to let them know so they don't get crestfallen, we need to have the maximum effort now.
[01:39:28.947 --> 01:39:33.249]  We need to have a maximum effort in donations on the street, and disagree if you disagree.
[01:39:33.309 --> 01:39:34.109]  I'm telling you my idea.
[01:39:34.329 --> 01:39:34.729]  Sure.
[01:39:34.769 --> 01:39:44.779]  We need to have the maximum money given, maximum phone calls to talk shows, maximum canvassing, people going to the site, signing up to be precinct leaders now, in a week they can do so much.
[01:39:47.724 --> 01:39:49.685]  I mean, obviously, he's starting to hint.
[01:39:50.265 --> 01:39:57.790]  There's so much momentum, so much money can be raised, and if... I mean, right now, Bloomberg sees how weak the two parties are.
[01:39:58.030 --> 01:40:04.715]  So if they shut Ron Paul out, cheat him out, I mean, you look at the numbers, he's popular with independents, he's popular with Democrats, Republicans.
[01:40:05.095 --> 01:40:07.937]  I've done a poll that shows, with Zogby, it was a fair poll.
[01:40:08.838 --> 01:40:11.139]  We even published the actual questions, which they never do.
[01:40:11.539 --> 01:40:16.463]  Ron Paul would win in a three-party race if he could get on the ballot everywhere,
[01:40:17.103 --> 01:40:25.072]  And even if he didn't win, he would be in those national debates to continue to expose the fact that both parties are pro-war and pro-New World Order.
[01:40:25.172 --> 01:40:26.494]  So there's my take, Kent Snyder.
[01:40:26.734 --> 01:40:27.475]  You've got the floor.
[01:40:27.515 --> 01:40:28.096]  Give us your take.
[01:40:28.516 --> 01:40:33.502]  Well, Dr. Paul has said many times, as you know, that this is not the end, it's the beginning.
[01:40:34.202 --> 01:40:37.306]  And he's also said none of us can really predict the future.
[01:40:37.785 --> 01:40:53.703]  And when you consider those two statements that he's made consistently from the start of this campaign a year ago, you know, I do believe that Dr. Paul and you and millions of other people around the United States, that this really is the beginning.
[01:40:53.743 --> 01:40:55.485]  In what form it takes, we don't know.
[01:40:55.925 --> 01:40:57.267]  Dr. Paul doesn't know.
[01:40:57.307 --> 01:40:58.148]  Nobody really knows.
[01:40:58.618 --> 01:41:08.183]  But the good news is, and this is where people should take satisfaction, they should take heart, and they should take this as a source of encouragement, that this is the beginning, it's not the end.
[01:41:08.303 --> 01:41:14.467]  Exactly what form it goes past Super Tuesday, or past the convention, or past the election, no one really knows.
[01:41:14.507 --> 01:41:22.331]  But the exciting part for Dr. Paul, and I've heard him say this publicly as well as privately, and for people who've been in the freedom movement for a long time,
[01:41:22.952 --> 01:41:24.334]  This is the beginning.
[01:41:24.494 --> 01:41:25.715]  That's the exciting part.
[01:41:25.795 --> 01:41:27.337]  What form it takes, we don't know.
[01:41:27.417 --> 01:41:38.769]  So I just encourage people, especially that are new to the Freedom Movement, new to the campaign, if you really consider it, the glass is half full, it's not half empty.
[01:41:39.209 --> 01:41:44.595]  And whatever happens, that to me is the exciting part, because I don't know exactly what form it's going to take.
[01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:45.946]  Absolutely.
[01:41:45.986 --> 01:41:47.967]  You've got to keep it fluid.
[01:41:48.528 --> 01:41:49.849]  You can't make decisions now.
[01:41:49.869 --> 01:41:51.490]  You've got to stay fully in this game.
[01:41:51.771 --> 01:41:53.052]  We're having incredible victories.
[01:41:53.072 --> 01:41:59.737]  I mean, if you go back six months ago, they were still cheating him on time, but he was getting a little more coverage because they thought he was an anomaly they could minimize.
[01:42:00.158 --> 01:42:01.679]  Now they're actually scared.
[01:42:01.979 --> 01:42:03.981]  That's when we saw the hit pieces get launched.
[01:42:04.842 --> 01:42:09.986]  I mean, they are desperate right now, and that shows how viable Ron Paul is.
[01:42:11.007 --> 01:42:20.196]  One thing is, so many new people have come to the political process who were turned off by it, or people who were turned off who'd been involved earlier, and they're expecting, you know, this is all going to be a bed of roses.
[01:42:20.216 --> 01:42:22.618]  This is a long, hard fight, Kent.
[01:42:23.198 --> 01:42:34.544]  Oh yeah, that's a good point, and I'm glad you reminded people of that, because things didn't get bad overnight, and it's going to take a long-term effort to correct them.
[01:42:35.443 --> 01:42:44.468]  We know that, a lot of people know that, but people who are fairly new to the political process and who are frustrated with how things are, you know, six months is no time at all.
[01:42:44.488 --> 01:42:58.355]  I mean, I understand their frustration, but, you know, people like Dr. Paul and yourself who've been involved in this for many, many years, you know, we just need to keep going and people need to understand who are fairly new to this freedom movement that there's a lot more that we need to do.
[01:42:58.475 --> 01:43:02.257]  But, like you said, a lot has been accomplished this last year, and for us,
[01:43:02.802 --> 01:43:07.067]  That really is the exciting part for us to keep going even harder and faster for the next 5, 10, 20, 30 years.
[01:43:07.207 --> 01:43:07.767]  Well, I'm not...
[01:43:10.928 --> 01:43:12.489]  Putting a pretty face on this.
[01:43:12.509 --> 01:43:16.210]  I don't have words to describe how good this is.
[01:43:17.231 --> 01:43:18.951]  Coming in third and fourth in some states.
[01:43:19.091 --> 01:43:20.472]  Winning second place.
[01:43:20.512 --> 01:43:22.533]  Clearly first place in Louisiana, but they cheated him.
[01:43:23.273 --> 01:43:24.654]  Winning first, second place.
[01:43:25.174 --> 01:43:26.834]  This huge buzz for liberty.
[01:43:27.175 --> 01:43:29.355]  As Ron Paul says, he will not be our leader.
[01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:34.618]  He is trying to be a focal point for turning the people's power and liberty in the free market loose.
[01:43:35.058 --> 01:43:38.099]  Again listeners, and most people understand this, but some still don't.
[01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:58.553]  This is so exciting what's happening and we've got to stay fully 110% in the game right now through Super Tuesday through the next couple primary days and then don't worry you're going to see what you mean hint hint we can't give the enemy too much ammo right now you're going to see something big happen
[01:43:59.293 --> 01:44:01.976]  Let's talk about, hypothetically, a three-way run.
[01:44:01.996 --> 01:44:05.480]  The problem is Bloomberg's going to come in now, knowing both parties are weak.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:11.967]  I see that as hurting Dr. Paul, but still, he'll be one of the strongest candidates in that fight.
[01:44:12.407 --> 01:44:13.268]  Give us your take on that.
[01:44:13.308 --> 01:44:14.069]  I mean, hypothetically.
[01:44:14.716 --> 01:44:17.178]  Well, yeah, I mean, I think you're right.
[01:44:17.999 --> 01:44:28.807]  Bloomberg is really the wild card, and he's the wild card because he has so much money, and he's publicly said, at least in the reports I read, that he would spend a half a billion or even a billion dollars to run.
[01:44:29.047 --> 01:44:34.411]  And, of course, that is an ungodly amount of money for someone to run for president.
[01:44:34.791 --> 01:44:42.660]  I also understand he's been doing quite a bit of polling and has been for the last several months to determine whether or not his campaign would be viable.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:52.832]  But I do think the other wild card is that the political taste and mood of the country, I think, is something that is really hard to gauge.
[01:44:54.231 --> 01:45:03.976]  I think my personal guess is that for us, the public by and large, they're not satisfied with Obama or Clinton or McCain or Romney.
[01:45:04.236 --> 01:45:06.197]  That's why they're kind of looking towards Bloomberg.
[01:45:06.257 --> 01:45:09.439]  But for us and our movement, I think the time is ripe.
[01:45:09.983 --> 01:45:11.104]  For us to keep going.
[01:45:11.184 --> 01:45:16.150]  So that's the one thing that is really the wild card is really what is the public sentiment.
[01:45:16.450 --> 01:45:22.237]  And if there is some sort of financial calamity or something else along the line, exactly how will people respond?
[01:45:22.677 --> 01:45:23.979]  I don't think that people really know.
[01:45:24.119 --> 01:45:31.327]  So the good news for us anyway is this presents an opportunity for serious movement.
[01:45:31.727 --> 01:45:32.167]  That's right.
[01:45:32.227 --> 01:45:40.211]  Politically, third-party candidates or alternative candidates always are stronger during major political realignments.
[01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:42.632]  We're in the middle of a political realignment.
[01:45:42.692 --> 01:45:44.232]  Ron Paul came at the perfect time.
[01:45:44.292 --> 01:45:49.394]  Every major political strategist, he was being honest, regardless of their stripe, have admitted this.
[01:45:49.834 --> 01:45:50.935]  They call it liquid.
[01:45:51.675 --> 01:45:57.480]  In the political realm, ladies and gentlemen, in the sociology and psychology and PR realm, things are liquid now.
[01:45:57.540 --> 01:46:02.204]  They've been frozen in the left-right false control paradigm for the last, really, 100 years.
[01:46:02.464 --> 01:46:04.085]  We're seeing the first major realignment.
[01:46:04.125 --> 01:46:05.006]  There's no debating.
[01:46:05.306 --> 01:46:07.248]  New York Times, Washington Post have all reported.
[01:46:07.588 --> 01:46:09.429]  Congress has an 11% approval rating.
[01:46:09.489 --> 01:46:10.510]  Both parties are hated.
[01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:12.712]  And there's only one candidate now in the race.
[01:46:13.192 --> 01:46:18.057]  Who is popular on every issue because it happens to be constitutional and the Constitution is popular.
[01:46:18.397 --> 01:46:20.419]  He's to control the borders, national sovereignty.
[01:46:20.459 --> 01:46:21.861]  He's against the unpopular war.
[01:46:22.722 --> 01:46:24.363]  He is against the inflation tax.
[01:46:24.443 --> 01:46:26.365]  He is dead on on every issue.
[01:46:26.405 --> 01:46:32.792]  So if we get the message out, if he can get on the ballot as a third party candidate, if that happens to happen, he is absolutely
[01:46:34.867 --> 01:46:35.607]  The candidate.
[01:46:35.647 --> 01:46:36.968]  He is the perfect candidate.
[01:46:36.988 --> 01:46:39.748]  I mean, this is like a fairy tale or something.
[01:46:39.788 --> 01:46:40.989]  It's so perfect.
[01:46:41.009 --> 01:46:47.410]  And then his message has, for 30 years, has been about what is now precipitating, what is now unfolding, Ken Snyder.
[01:46:47.890 --> 01:46:48.930]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:46:48.970 --> 01:46:54.611]  I mean, Dr. Paul, as you know, and your listeners, I'm sure, know that Dr. Paul has been making these statements for the last 30 years.
[01:46:54.651 --> 01:46:57.232]  He's been making these predictions time and time again.
[01:46:57.897 --> 01:47:02.340]  He's found to be correct in all of those, especially the predictions in terms of what's happening.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:14.808]  And as everyone knows who's followed Dr. Paul et al., they realize that he has such a consistent record, a long-time, long-term record in terms of what he's talked about, his votes, his legislation.
[01:47:15.169 --> 01:47:22.634]  So when people look to Dr. Paul for the first time, I'm struck time and time again, they usually
[01:47:23.499 --> 01:47:31.521]  You know, he has a record that's so consistent, that's long and consistent, that it gives me a feeling of trust in terms of who this person is.
[01:47:31.981 --> 01:47:34.122]  And that's something that you just don't do overnight.
[01:47:34.202 --> 01:47:45.645]  So fortunately for him and for the campaign and the supporters, we're now able to showcase that trust and that people are finding that, especially in today's climate, they're finding that very attractive.
[01:47:47.346 --> 01:47:49.887]  We've only got about a minute and a half left with you, Ken Schneider.
[01:47:52.788 --> 01:48:14.999]  Hypothetically, when a congressman is picking up delegates every time they have a primary, and the other candidates are dropping out so he's getting more and more attention even though they try to freeze him out, how many delegates do you think you need to get to stay in the Republican process, and when might we see, and again this is all hypothetical, the announcement for third party?
[01:48:15.603 --> 01:48:20.084]  Well, as far as the delegates, I mean, that really is a function of how Romney and McCain go.
[01:48:20.124 --> 01:48:25.345]  I mean, if Romney and McCain come down with 45% of the delegates into the convention in September in St.
[01:48:25.385 --> 01:48:27.126]  Paul, Minneapolis, St.
[01:48:27.166 --> 01:48:37.748]  Paul, and then Dr. Paul has 10% of the delegates, that would be certainly enough for Dr. Paul to have, if you will, a bargaining chip, a very big one.
[01:48:38.108 --> 01:48:41.009]  So it's really going to come down to how Romney and McCain
[01:48:42.539 --> 01:48:46.721]  So you think a brokered convention is in the cards?
[01:48:47.301 --> 01:48:48.561]  Oh, I think it's definitely possible.
[01:48:49.081 --> 01:48:49.882]  Okay, okay.
[01:48:50.582 --> 01:48:54.003]  I agree with you from my perspective, but you know more about this than I do.
[01:48:56.063 --> 01:49:02.125]  At the same time, again, I see the third party move as even stronger at that point.
[01:49:03.045 --> 01:49:06.306]  What do you like, the Constitution Party or the Libertarians?
[01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.147]  Well, I don't know.
[01:49:08.207 --> 01:49:10.388]  I mean, it's really hard to say.
[01:49:11.641 --> 01:49:12.803]  I'm not evading your question.
[01:49:12.843 --> 01:49:18.993]  I'm just so focused on the task at hand that I don't even think about post that.
[01:49:19.033 --> 01:49:21.097]  The only thing, again, I'll say is, as I said earlier,
[01:49:22.345 --> 01:49:23.446]  Nobody knows the future.
[01:49:23.466 --> 01:49:25.087]  We'll just have to assess it at that time.
[01:49:25.107 --> 01:49:27.448]  I think that's how Dr. Paul thinks as well.
[01:49:27.548 --> 01:49:27.828]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:27.888 --> 01:49:30.289]  I want to stay forward-focused on the battles at hand.
[01:49:30.329 --> 01:49:31.049]  I agree with you.
[01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:32.130]  Everybody, redouble efforts.
[01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:35.211]  But, I wanted people to know there's a battle coming after that.
[01:49:35.391 --> 01:49:37.372]  There's a whole other half in the ballgame, sir.
[01:49:37.672 --> 01:49:37.893]  Yep.
[01:49:37.933 --> 01:49:38.473]  Very good, sir.
[01:49:38.873 --> 01:49:40.114]  Thank you so much, Ken Schneider.
[01:49:40.334 --> 01:49:41.014]  Thanks for having me.
[01:49:41.214 --> 01:49:41.594]  You bet.
[01:49:41.634 --> 01:49:44.996]  There goes Ken Schneider, head of the Ron Paul 2008.com campaign.
[01:49:45.456 --> 01:49:46.256]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:46.276 --> 01:49:47.097]  KENU straight ahead.
[01:49:47.137 --> 01:49:49.038]  And then our massive guest in studio.
[01:49:49.058 --> 01:49:49.518]  Stay with us.
[01:49:52.538 --> 01:49:53.199]  It's a fact.
[01:49:53.419 --> 01:50:00.884]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:50:01.004 --> 01:50:09.851]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:50:10.131 --> 01:50:20.722]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:50:20.942 --> 01:50:26.968]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:50:27.228 --> 01:50:32.253]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:50:32.433 --> 01:50:36.917]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:50:37.077 --> 01:50:38.879]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:50:38.939 --> 01:50:39.119]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:50:39.139 --> 01:50:39.519]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:50:39.539 --> 01:50:40.841]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:50:40.861 --> 01:50:41.541]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[01:50:52.637 --> 01:50:54.318]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:54.638 --> 01:50:58.139]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:58.259 --> 01:51:00.179]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:03.460]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:09.282]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:13.503]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:51:13.823 --> 01:51:18.767]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:51:54.088 --> 01:51:57.471]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:51:57.611 --> 01:52:02.835]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:52:03.015 --> 01:52:07.799]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:19.189]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[01:53:03.795 --> 01:53:05.917]  I wanted to have Chad pop in for just a moment.
[01:53:05.937 --> 01:53:08.199]  I forgot to ask you, John, is he there?
[01:53:33.782 --> 01:53:34.202]  All right.
[01:53:34.602 --> 01:53:35.002]  Look at this.
[01:53:35.022 --> 01:53:37.664]  This is Finance and Development, mainstream magazine.
[01:53:38.524 --> 01:53:39.305]  Global government.
[01:53:39.745 --> 01:53:41.086]  Who is in charge?
[01:53:41.126 --> 01:53:42.467]  Just global government in your face.
[01:53:43.067 --> 01:53:46.069]  But then if you say you don't want global government, they say that magazine doesn't exist.
[01:53:46.089 --> 01:53:47.470]  That UN announcement doesn't exist.
[01:53:48.230 --> 01:53:50.652]  Ted, you were reading to me just last night over the phone.
[01:53:50.672 --> 01:53:51.312]  I went and pulled it up.
[01:53:51.332 --> 01:53:53.073]  The Wall Street Journal's on about $230 an ounce gold.
[01:53:53.093 --> 01:53:55.335]  Excuse me, $2,300 an ounce gold.
[01:53:55.355 --> 01:53:56.195]  I wish it was $230.
[01:54:01.371 --> 01:54:03.141]  Uh, like it got close to a few years ago.
[01:54:03.201 --> 01:54:04.750]  It's at 9.30 something today.
[01:54:05.855 --> 01:54:07.036]  Ted, tell us about that report.
[01:54:07.417 --> 01:54:13.721]  Oh yeah, I was reading it myself, and it's good to see that the stock people are finally coming along with this, too.
[01:54:13.741 --> 01:54:19.406]  $2,300 gold because of the fact that the inflation hasn't been adjusted yet on the gold prices.
[01:54:19.866 --> 01:54:34.237]  They're saying that gold has been a poor hedge against inflation due to the fact that the central banks have been manipulating it for so long, and now it's breaking loose, and that's exactly what got... You know, the reason why I picked up the Wall Street Journal is because I wanted to see that GATA ad.
[01:54:34.877 --> 01:54:38.478]  And they're looking for $3,000 to $5,000 an ounce gold.
[01:54:38.858 --> 01:54:43.039]  And they want to do this audit on the Fort Knox.
[01:54:43.639 --> 01:54:44.959]  And it's really something.
[01:54:44.979 --> 01:54:49.240]  I need some Prozac after reading that full Wall Street Journal newspaper.
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:56.242]  All the woes going on, the lending institutions that are going bankrupt, the subprime loan stuff.
[01:54:56.762 --> 01:54:57.463]  We're good to go.
[01:55:11.992 --> 01:55:18.574]  And that's, you know, the people that are selling stocks now are saying this, that you've got to get out of paper and you've got to get into gold.
[01:55:18.914 --> 01:55:27.116]  I think it's just ironic and somewhat comical to see those guys finally turning around and going, you know, we really do have problems.
[01:55:27.136 --> 01:55:28.236]  We better start looking at gold.
[01:55:28.276 --> 01:55:33.657]  And they're talking about buying gold not as an investment, but they want to buy it now as insurance.
[01:55:33.917 --> 01:55:35.558]  Well, it's about time they wake up.
[01:55:35.578 --> 01:55:36.398]  They should have been buying it
[01:55:36.778 --> 01:55:39.801]  Six years ago was insurance when the handwriting was on the wall.
[01:55:39.841 --> 01:55:45.606]  Now we're experiencing the problems and they're finally saying, yeah, go ahead guys, let's diversify and get into gold.
[01:55:46.166 --> 01:55:48.508]  Chad, how much gold do you have at last week's price?
[01:55:48.968 --> 01:55:50.550]  I didn't talk to you before we did this offer.
[01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:52.771]  I mean, do you have it still at last week's price?
[01:55:52.852 --> 01:55:55.614]  I have a few things that are still sitting here in inventory.
[01:55:55.674 --> 01:55:58.116]  Obviously, we don't sell everything out.
[01:55:58.276 --> 01:56:01.739]  I have some of those British Sovereigns that are still at a really good price level.
[01:56:01.879 --> 01:56:03.941]  I mean, if you take a look at gold right now,
[01:56:04.781 --> 01:56:07.763]  Gold today hit $935.70.
[01:56:07.984 --> 01:56:14.028]  Right now we're looking at roughly around $910 for gold, and it's strong.
[01:56:14.108 --> 01:56:21.373]  I mean, at that $935.70... It's gyrating up and down, but staying above $900 now, off and on for months.
[01:56:21.413 --> 01:56:23.834]  Ted, how do people call?
[01:56:23.894 --> 01:56:25.375]  Tell them about the different offers you've got.
[01:56:25.536 --> 01:56:26.716]  Yeah, right now they call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:56:26.736 --> 01:56:27.957]  We do have the British Sovereigns.
[01:56:28.017 --> 01:56:29.078]  Right now they're currently at $256.
[01:56:33.741 --> 01:56:35.502]  We got the Franks right now at $2.05.
[01:56:35.882 --> 01:56:45.126]  I do have some of those gold commemoratives left at $3.40, and the silver dollars obviously are a great buy at this time as well.
[01:56:45.526 --> 01:56:46.987]  Alex, I just can't say enough.
[01:56:47.347 --> 01:56:59.532]  I mean, right now the Wall Street Journal is calling for $1,000 gold here, and now before things correct and adjust for inflation, $2,300 an ounce for gold.
[01:56:59.913 --> 01:57:03.174]  I mean, that's the Wall Street Journal and that's coming from the
[01:57:03.314 --> 01:57:05.075]  Give them the number on those offers.
[01:57:05.115 --> 01:57:06.255]  You can't beat these deals.
[01:57:06.535 --> 01:57:07.536]  Are you out of silver dollars?
[01:57:07.796 --> 01:57:08.756]  No, I still have some.
[01:57:08.796 --> 01:57:10.057]  You can call us at 800-686-2237.
[01:57:10.077 --> 01:57:13.298]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:57:13.398 --> 01:57:17.260]  Now folks, the price has gone up.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.461]  They have limited supplies.
[01:57:18.541 --> 01:57:19.741]  It's the Alex Jones Special.
[01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:22.062]  It will be gone by the end of the weekend, okay?
[01:57:22.623 --> 01:57:23.643]  And there's not much left.
[01:57:23.663 --> 01:57:23.703]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:23.723 --> 01:57:23.843]  800-686-2237.
[01:57:23.863 --> 01:57:25.544]  We'll be right back with Paul Grudy.
[01:57:25.564 --> 01:57:25.844]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.795 --> 01:57:35.676]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:37.496 --> 01:57:39.617]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:49.620]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:51.320]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.001 --> 01:57:53.121]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.781 --> 01:57:54.581]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.342 --> 01:57:56.142]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.895 --> 01:58:00.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.082 --> 01:58:05.148]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.978 --> 01:58:11.380]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to have Paul Grudy on.
[01:58:13.381 --> 01:58:18.784]  He was the head of the funeral home that took in the body of who they claim was Lee Harvey Oswald.
[01:58:19.384 --> 01:58:30.191]  They then, uh, government came in and made him put his handprints, fingerprints, on the Magna Carta Cano rifle that they claim shot, uh, Kennedy, uh, in three shots in six seconds.
[01:58:30.211 --> 01:58:34.313]  So we're going to have Mr. Grudy in studio coming up in about six minutes.
[01:58:35.013 --> 01:58:39.835]  After this quick break, we're going to talk to Mr. Groody on air about 30 minutes of the last 15-20 minutes.
[01:58:39.915 --> 01:58:47.639]  If you have specific questions about the JFK assassination and his story, then you're absolutely welcome to call in as well.
[01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:54.342]  I'm, of course, making a documentary about the JFK assassination, interviewing St.
[01:58:54.362 --> 01:59:01.725]  John Hunt, interviewing Jim Mars and others, and we're so honored to have Mr. Groody in studio with us.
[01:59:03.163 --> 01:59:04.484]  I'll tell you about a couple of great sponsors.
[01:59:04.564 --> 01:59:05.545]  One of them is Inner Food.
[01:59:05.965 --> 01:59:06.725]  I take it every day.
[01:59:07.006 --> 01:59:08.086]  Most of my office takes it.
[01:59:09.427 --> 01:59:12.189]  I know they just ran out the other day, so they went down to Brave New Books here in Austin.
[01:59:12.249 --> 01:59:13.730]  It's a distributor of it and bought some.
[01:59:14.251 --> 01:59:15.271]  I ate some last night.
[01:59:16.312 --> 01:59:18.273]  It's 20 superfoods.
[01:59:18.534 --> 01:59:20.875]  Because most vitamins you take, you don't absorb most of it.
[01:59:20.895 --> 01:59:21.496]  It goes right through you.
[01:59:21.756 --> 01:59:24.598]  This is the foods unpasteurized, so it keeps the value.
[01:59:24.638 --> 01:59:25.939]  It hasn't been heated up.
[01:59:27.059 --> 01:59:32.203]  It's balanced energy all day long, greater stamina, weight loss, reduced food cravings, healthy, radiant skin.
[01:59:33.763 --> 01:59:37.945]  It's got so many different super foods in it.
[01:59:38.125 --> 01:59:44.367]  Dulse kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, so many things that are in the inner food.
[01:59:44.948 --> 01:59:59.294]  And I just hope that you will go to their website enerfood.com and if you order 12 or more of the Inner Food Coconut Powder, my listeners will get 20% off.
[01:59:59.594 --> 02:00:02.735]  When you go to infowars.com and link to the banner right there on the site,
[02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:14.214]  You get 10% off by ordering off that subpage of enterfood.com or give them a call at 866-762-9238.
[02:00:14.234 --> 02:00:14.494]  866-762-9238.
[02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:16.595]  Also, the economy in so much trouble.
[02:00:16.655 --> 02:00:19.916]  Back during the Depression, most people stored food.
[02:00:19.956 --> 02:00:20.756]  Even people in the city.
[02:00:20.776 --> 02:00:23.357]  80% of the population was in the rural areas.
[02:00:23.397 --> 02:00:24.537]  People could take care of themselves.
[02:00:24.557 --> 02:00:25.438]  It was still devastating.
[02:00:26.618 --> 02:00:28.779]  Now the talk of serious recession, depression on.
[02:00:29.834 --> 02:00:37.322]  You need to get the food now, and the great folks at the J. Michael Stevens Group, until the 11th of this month, aren't going to raise prices.
[02:00:37.442 --> 02:00:40.486]  Because of inflation, they're going to have to raise prices after that.
[02:00:40.526 --> 02:00:41.347]  So give them a call.
[02:00:41.387 --> 02:00:42.488]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:00:43.081 --> 02:00:55.425]  What other insurance do you know you're going to be able to use, whether it's good times or bad times, just a good idea, call them, learn about the really tasty, great freeze-dried foods they have at store more than 10 years, 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or the big banners on top of PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com that link to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:00:55.465 --> 02:00:55.905]  Now, as I said,
[02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:17.137]  In closing, we're going to come back and get into the JFK assassination with just an amazing eyewitness and a very kind, very nice person.
[02:01:17.157 --> 02:01:20.239]  I enjoyed meeting his son, who I saw at a talk fest this weekend.
[02:01:20.259 --> 02:01:21.420]  I enjoyed meeting Mr. Groody.
[02:01:22.081 --> 02:01:25.683]  And of course, also he has his wife here with him today, and she's just a sweetheart.
[02:01:26.124 --> 02:01:29.886]  So it's great to have this gentleman here with us.
[02:01:30.667 --> 02:01:34.590]  He enlisted in the United States Army and became a chaplain assistant and then surgical technician.
[02:01:35.615 --> 02:01:37.277]  And that was in World War II.
[02:01:37.837 --> 02:01:40.760]  My goodness, these guys are so great.
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:43.162]  It's always good just to be able to talk to a World War II vet.
[02:01:43.783 --> 02:01:45.484]  Both my grandfathers are now gone.
[02:01:46.545 --> 02:01:47.886]  And one of them was a B-17 gunner.
[02:01:50.061 --> 02:01:54.205]  And, uh, the other, uh, was in, uh, fighter planes, but, uh, I probably wouldn't be here, though.
[02:01:54.225 --> 02:01:58.568]  He crashed pretty early in the war, and so he got injured and got out of it quick.
[02:01:59.009 --> 02:02:01.351]  As I know, my other grandfather almost got killed in those B-17s.
[02:02:01.391 --> 02:02:06.955]  So, I guess, hand to God there, you never know what happens, uh, in things, so you'll be around.
[02:02:06.975 --> 02:02:10.418]  Because, you know, on a lot of those missions, they would lose half of their aircraft.
[02:02:10.939 --> 02:02:17.004]  That's how dangerous it was going into Italy, going into Germany, going into the Balkans, up against the Nazis.
[02:02:18.562 --> 02:02:22.024]  Both my grandfathers, again, were in the European Theater of Operations.
[02:02:22.104 --> 02:02:27.728]  Even worse, or as bad, out there, of course, in the Pacific.
[02:02:27.748 --> 02:02:29.489]  So we'll get him to talk a little bit about that.
[02:02:29.549 --> 02:02:31.010]  He's seen quite a few things.
[02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:32.270]  He's Paul Grudy.
[02:02:33.031 --> 02:02:38.094]  On the other side of this quick break, right here, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:44.651 --> 02:02:52.575]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:02:53.056 --> 02:02:56.177]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[02:05:26.510 --> 02:05:27.670]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.407 --> 02:06:01.948]  Paul Grudy was born in Washington, Kansas on February 22, 1919, George Washington's birthday.
[02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:08.290]  After high school and college, Paul graduated from the Williams Institute of Mortuary Science.
[02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:12.511]  He enlisted in the United States Army and became a chaplain's assistant and a surgical technician.
[02:06:12.891 --> 02:06:17.672]  After being honorably discharged, he returned to civilian life to build cemeteries, homes, and mortuaries.
[02:06:18.772 --> 02:06:23.213]  Paul was the licensed undertaker and funeral director in charge of the burial, subsequent
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:25.021]  I'm just glad to do it.
[02:06:44.039 --> 02:06:54.882]  We appreciate the fact that after all these years we can still talk about it and enjoy the fact that it is something that the public is still interested in.
[02:06:56.663 --> 02:06:57.243]  Absolutely.
[02:06:57.483 --> 02:07:05.905]  Tell us about growing up, World War II, a little bit about yourself and how you got into the mortuary business leading up to the tragic assassination in 1963.
[02:07:09.596 --> 02:07:15.643]  happened to be a part of the family that had a mortuary in Ohio.
[02:07:16.243 --> 02:07:22.891]  And because of that background, I was inclined, and my brother was also inclined, to become a mortician.
[02:07:23.604 --> 02:07:23.724]  Yeah.
[02:07:41.890 --> 02:07:42.611]  All the time.
[02:07:42.971 --> 02:07:55.400]  We are the ones that had to do what most folks didn't really ever want to do, and that was to go to a home or to go where somebody had died or been killed.
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:04.126]  We're the ones that had to clean up that sort of mess that always exists around that kind of death.
[02:08:06.858 --> 02:08:11.540]  Continuing from there, so you were trained as a mortician before you went to World War II?
[02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:12.640]  Absolutely.
[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:15.181]  I was a licensed bomber and funeral director.
[02:08:15.221 --> 02:08:17.381]  You have to get a license to do so.
[02:08:17.401 --> 02:08:20.622]  I handled a lot of bodies.
[02:08:21.503 --> 02:08:28.565]  Matter of fact, in the Williams Institute of Mortuary Sciences, it was required that we deal with at least eight
[02:08:32.508 --> 02:08:39.493]  I happen to be so easily accessible and so interested in it, I had 88 instead of just 8.
[02:08:40.634 --> 02:08:57.467]  Because of my background there, I ended up in the medical field with the Army, and because of that, every pathologist that ever came around and was in a base hospital, wherever we were stationed in the States or overseas,
[02:08:58.067 --> 02:09:08.298]  They would hunt me up because I could assist that pathologist with an autopsy, whereas to find somebody who had that kind of background, it was a little unusual.
[02:09:08.985 --> 02:09:11.026]  And then you got even more training in World War II.
[02:09:11.066 --> 02:09:13.847]  You were in the Pacific Theater?
[02:09:14.287 --> 02:09:21.190]  Yes, we were the infantry regiment that were the ones that fought in the Bulge.
[02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:22.770]  So you were in the European Theater?
[02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:24.391]  Yes, we were European Theater.
[02:09:24.451 --> 02:09:36.896]  We ended up going into Le Havre, going through France and up into Germany, fought the Germans, and at that time we knew it was winding down because the Germans were running out of
[02:09:37.376 --> 02:09:37.877]  Yes, I do.
[02:09:54.955 --> 02:10:14.236]  Because of the fact that they were winding down, it didn't make a lot of difference, but a German Red Cross agent, one who was an honest-to-goodness medic like I was, came across the line and said, Sergeant, can I end up working with you guys because we know we're ending the war?
[02:10:15.077 --> 02:10:18.780]  He was using perfect English, and I said, how come you can talk so good?
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:20.582]  Oh, he said, I've been to the States.
[02:10:20.682 --> 02:10:21.362]  I've been around.
[02:10:21.422 --> 02:10:23.284]  My family's been around.
[02:10:23.304 --> 02:10:27.367]  And he said, if I could work with you guys, I would sure like that.
[02:10:27.547 --> 02:10:32.171]  And I said, come on, we always could use extra help because we were still in the war.
[02:10:32.531 --> 02:10:33.532]  We were still fighting.
[02:10:33.572 --> 02:10:34.733]  They were still shooting at us.
[02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:43.080]  Do you know that the Red Cross man who is the representative of the American Red Cross was a part of our outfit?
[02:10:44.125 --> 02:10:52.471]  He lost his Jeep and this young German found out about it and he told the man, he said, you lost your Jeep?
[02:10:52.651 --> 02:10:53.952]  He said, yeah, it blew up.
[02:10:54.012 --> 02:10:55.974]  He said, I hit a mine and it tore it up.
[02:10:56.334 --> 02:10:57.655]  He said, I don't have a vehicle.
[02:10:57.675 --> 02:10:59.636]  He said, you just sit still a while.
[02:10:59.656 --> 02:11:00.797]  He said, I'll be back.
[02:11:01.317 --> 02:11:09.884]  He went across the line, went over to the motor pool on the German side and came driving back in a great big German Mercedes
[02:11:10.804 --> 02:11:17.887]  I mean, I don't want to make you tell any war stories, but what were some of the most amazing or harrowing things that you saw while you were in Europe?
[02:11:40.658 --> 02:11:45.919]  Well, of course they were bringing me not only the Americans who had been injured and hit by
[02:11:46.826 --> 02:11:47.166]  Yeah, I
[02:12:13.244 --> 02:12:15.846]  It was remarkable that they did save their lives.
[02:12:43.024 --> 02:13:01.052]  And after all these years, I found out that a lot of us at that time were never treated for the fact that the bombs going off and the ammunition that was used and the type of death that we saw and the
[02:13:02.228 --> 02:13:22.892]  Bad stuff stuck in our minds and they didn't recognize this, only now they do for the boys that are over in Iraq, that they really realize that they're committing suicide and they are not being, they had a problem, but we, back in those days, had no help whatsoever.
[02:13:23.133 --> 02:13:29.894]  They didn't know that we were affected by the bombs and by the death that was around us.
[02:13:30.434 --> 02:13:33.198]  Uh, we ended up going all the way across Germany.
[02:13:47.415 --> 02:13:51.818]  Clear across Czechoslovakia, up to Czechoslovakia.
[02:13:52.218 --> 02:13:57.121]  Now that was 1300 miles away from La Havre.
[02:13:57.581 --> 02:14:02.004]  They put us aboard little boxcars and took us back.
[02:14:02.084 --> 02:14:02.644]  That was 1300 miles.
[02:14:04.165 --> 02:14:07.286]  Something that affected me at the time that still carries over.
[02:14:07.847 --> 02:14:10.127]  Do you know our car had a flat wheel?
[02:14:10.568 --> 02:14:16.270]  It was thump, thump, thump, thump, thump all day long for that 1,300 miles.
[02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:23.593]  And to realize today, when I go to a grocery store and get a cart and it's got a bumpy wheel, man, I get rid of that booger.
[02:14:23.673 --> 02:14:25.394]  I can't stand that.
[02:14:25.434 --> 02:14:31.336]  So this something carries over all these years later, realizing it was that many years later.
[02:14:32.076 --> 02:14:32.657]  It's amazing.
[02:14:32.717 --> 02:14:44.526]  Now, when we're going to break, I want to come back and get directly into the JFK assassination and the part you play in that whole saga and story that is now coming to a head, finally, in closure today.
[02:14:45.486 --> 02:14:52.572]  Paul Gritty, what were you doing on that horrible day in 1963 when the President was killed?
[02:14:53.933 --> 02:14:57.195]  We were at the funeral home in Fort Worth.
[02:14:57.970 --> 02:15:00.111]  And I was managing that theater home.
[02:15:00.891 --> 02:15:04.673]  Secret Service called me and said, you are Paul Grudy.
[02:15:04.753 --> 02:15:12.636]  We have checked into the records and found that you are a licensed mortician, that you did fight in the bones since you fought in the war.
[02:15:13.096 --> 02:15:24.661]  Secret Service said, you come to Dallas and get the body of this man because we want your kind of guy to help us get the job done of knowing that this man was embalmed.
[02:15:25.181 --> 02:15:29.405]  And buried properly, and that's how we did it.
[02:15:29.525 --> 02:15:32.408]  Now, we did go to Dallas.
[02:15:32.508 --> 02:15:42.576]  I did go to Dallas and pick up his body, brought him back to funeral home in Fort Worth, embalmed that body, made arrangements and buried him.
[02:15:42.917 --> 02:15:51.384]  But a part of that that I think is so important, do you know the general public talks about Lee Harvey Oswald doing this?
[02:15:52.330 --> 02:15:55.432]  I know his mother or knew his mother because she's gone.
[02:15:56.793 --> 02:15:59.795]  She never was convinced that it was really Lee Harvey.
[02:16:01.176 --> 02:16:08.020]  His brother, his wife, the two babies and of course one thing about it, to think that this guy was
[02:16:08.643 --> 02:16:08.983]  I think?
[02:16:32.834 --> 02:16:33.214]  I think so.
[02:17:00.292 --> 02:17:05.575]  And now, I didn't know before, maybe there was a third nut out there was going to come and shoot the undertaker.
[02:17:05.715 --> 02:17:06.256]  I didn't know.
[02:17:06.296 --> 02:17:15.101]  Well, when we get back, I want to break down, I mean, as slowly as possible, as detailed as possible, Mr. Grudy.
[02:17:15.561 --> 02:17:25.207]  I want to walk through what happened that day, then when Oswald got killed, how the Secret Service had you come get his body, how they had you put the fingerprints on it, and the rest of it, okay?
[02:17:26.504 --> 02:17:31.326]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back after this quick break with Paul Grudy.
[02:17:31.926 --> 02:17:35.007]  Remember, for the rest of the hour, very interesting history.
[02:17:35.067 --> 02:17:37.347]  Stay with us.
[02:17:44.789 --> 02:17:46.210]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:48.310]  A new world order.
[02:17:49.051 --> 02:17:53.292]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:17:53.928 --> 02:17:56.071]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:17:56.732 --> 02:17:58.975]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:17:59.536 --> 02:18:01.999]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:10.050]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:13.044 --> 02:18:18.047]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:18.527 --> 02:18:21.989]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:24.871]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:24.931 --> 02:18:25.932]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:25.952 --> 02:18:26.832]  They're not after money.
[02:18:26.872 --> 02:18:27.953]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:28.153 --> 02:18:28.954]  They're after power.
[02:18:29.154 --> 02:18:29.854]  That's what happens.

[02:18:44.825 --> 02:18:47.148]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:18:47.168 --> 02:18:54.338]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[02:18:55.183 --> 02:19:02.547]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, B.I.
[02:19:02.607 --> 02:19:03.287]  Lenin, on them.
[02:19:04.127 --> 02:19:08.830]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[02:19:09.430 --> 02:19:13.352]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.

[02:21:45.398 --> 02:21:54.687]  Paul Grudy is our guest.
[02:21:54.707 --> 02:21:56.208]  He was the funeral home director.
[02:21:56.228 --> 02:21:59.632]  They had to come out and pick up the body of Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:22:01.158 --> 02:22:18.482]  He wanted to prove that it indeed was Oswald later because there have been debates about three guys with the same name, different people running around, but the big issue here is the Secret Service came and had him put his palm print of the dead body of Lee Harvey Oswald on the Malinker Carcano rifle.
[02:22:18.802 --> 02:22:28.924]  So if you can, Mr. Groody, walk us through when you went and picked up his body and then later when they came back and had you put the palm print on there in as much detail as you can.
[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:39.098]  Just the fact that we knew good and well if they put a palm print on his hand that they would put the black
[02:22:39.973 --> 02:22:52.318]  Uh... ink all over his hand and I was concerned the fact that when they did that I had to clean it up again because I was the one going to have to bury this guy and I didn't want that black all over everything.
[02:22:52.718 --> 02:22:57.840]  So it was a matter of asking them to be careful when they did this.
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:08.864]  But they came to my preparation room as we call it and did actually apply his hand onto that rifle to prove that that rifle had the
[02:23:09.671 --> 02:23:09.751]  The
[02:23:27.953 --> 02:23:29.974]  Brother said this is Lee Harvey.
[02:23:30.014 --> 02:23:31.795]  His wife said it was him.
[02:23:32.435 --> 02:23:38.998]  Now, because of that, I had to type up a death certificate and file it, because that is my job.
[02:23:39.519 --> 02:23:44.921]  And I had to prove that it was really Lee Harvey Oswald, and that's why I was convinced it was Lee Harvey.
[02:23:45.161 --> 02:23:46.422]  Now, who did the shooting?
[02:23:46.822 --> 02:23:54.266]  I absolutely do not know, but the Secret Service established the fact that they felt that that was who it was supposed to be.
[02:23:54.286 --> 02:23:54.766]  I understand.
[02:23:54.786 --> 02:23:56.567]  Let's walk through this now very slowly.
[02:23:57.814 --> 02:23:59.917]  You know, go back in memory, Mr. Grudy.
[02:23:59.937 --> 02:24:12.394]  You know, they come in, they take his hand, they put it where on the Mannlicher Carcano rifle, and B, was this the rifle, did they tell you this was the rifle that Oswald had supposedly had?
[02:24:12.874 --> 02:24:25.544]  This is what they told me, that they wanted to do that because this was the rifle that they got from the school book depository, and that was the one that Oswald was supposed to have used.
[02:24:25.905 --> 02:24:26.966]  Now, we don't know.
[02:24:27.546 --> 02:24:28.647]  I have no knowledge.
[02:24:28.707 --> 02:24:31.009]  The fact was, were they telling me the truth?
[02:24:31.389 --> 02:24:34.692]  Well, that's where all the speculation can come from.
[02:24:35.032 --> 02:24:37.895]  Could have been some drummed-up deal.
[02:24:38.055 --> 02:24:38.715]  We don't know.
[02:24:39.176 --> 02:24:40.317]  I have no idea.
[02:24:40.377 --> 02:24:43.499]  But the one thing I had to establish was it wasn't really Lee Harvey.
[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:46.242]  So, therefore, I had the body of Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:24:46.682 --> 02:24:49.003]  They knew I had the body of Lehar Valdez.
[02:24:49.363 --> 02:24:51.304]  Describe the layout.
[02:24:51.404 --> 02:24:56.947]  Now, first you got the body, was that the day after he was killed in Dallas or when was that?
[02:24:57.807 --> 02:25:05.491]  Well, he was killed that same day was the day I went to Dallas after the autopsy had been performed, which is in April.
[02:25:05.851 --> 02:25:06.131]  I don't
[02:25:25.948 --> 02:25:26.428]  I think so.
[02:25:53.015 --> 02:25:53.475]  I think so.
[02:26:16.042 --> 02:26:16.362]  Better.
[02:26:16.742 --> 02:26:21.444]  And after all, I've been in this business, you know, for 75 years.
[02:26:21.524 --> 02:26:24.085]  I've seen so much of that very thing happen to me.
[02:26:24.105 --> 02:26:30.486]  Well, they say that the trauma medics see hundreds of times what any surgeon will ever see from gunshots from war.
[02:26:30.787 --> 02:26:31.547]  Absolutely.
[02:26:31.687 --> 02:26:44.411]  And to know that my experience overseas and with the bodies and people I was around and with all the army camps where people had been accidentally killed and whatnot and all the autopsies, I've been around thousands of them.
[02:26:45.592 --> 02:26:50.397]  I saw what I saw, and I know that this guy was killed by Ruby.
[02:26:50.557 --> 02:26:51.758]  Now, I don't know who else.
[02:26:51.798 --> 02:26:55.362]  They couldn't have substituted a body on me.
[02:26:55.462 --> 02:26:57.844]  They would not have come up with a body that quick.
[02:26:57.965 --> 02:27:03.691]  And the reason you bring this up is because then there became a big controversy about was it Oswald or not.
[02:27:03.711 --> 02:27:04.552]  Oswald or not.
[02:27:04.752 --> 02:27:05.753]  Now, I buried him.
[02:27:06.756 --> 02:27:13.321]  Seventeen years later, the head of the British Intelligence called me and said... Well, hold on.
[02:27:13.341 --> 02:27:14.843]  Let's hear about this on the other side, okay?
[02:27:14.943 --> 02:27:15.223]  Okay.
[02:27:15.683 --> 02:27:16.164]  We've got a break.
[02:27:16.184 --> 02:27:19.306]  We're going to come back with Paul Grudy on the other side.
[02:27:19.326 --> 02:27:29.394]  I want to go back again and have you go back to memory exactly what the Secret Service said, what they had to do with the hand, then the former head of British Intelligence calling you, the exhuming of the body.
[02:27:29.414 --> 02:27:31.656]  We're going to talk about it all with Paul Grudy on the other side.
[02:27:35.129 --> 02:27:36.190]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.510 --> 02:27:38.111]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.032 --> 02:27:41.854]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.956 --> 02:27:45.497]  Hi neighbor.
[02:27:45.837 --> 02:27:51.341]  No matter when the time comes to survive on our food supply, every single one of us who have prepared will have two regrets.
[02:27:51.962 --> 02:27:57.706]  Even those who haven't wasted a single penny on Christmas, birthdays, and vacations in order to store all the food possible.
[02:27:58.446 --> 02:28:01.669]  Even those who have sold stuff and taken on part-time jobs to buy food.
[02:28:02.336 --> 02:28:05.637]  Even those who have traded their gold while it will still buy food.
[02:28:06.238 --> 02:28:09.599]  Yes, we will have been called stupid, crazy and foolish.
[02:28:10.219 --> 02:28:14.721]  When folks won't be able to afford food and there won't be any food for any amount of money.
[02:28:15.441 --> 02:28:17.422]  We will still have two regrets.
[02:28:18.082 --> 02:28:21.404]  We will regret that we didn't get more serious about more food sooner.
[02:28:22.104 --> 02:28:24.945]  We will deeply regret that we didn't get enough food.
[02:28:25.757 --> 02:28:32.601]  Putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make.
[02:28:33.382 --> 02:28:33.642]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:28:33.662 --> 02:28:34.763]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:28:34.783 --> 02:28:34.823]  800-409-5633.
[02:28:44.326 --> 02:28:48.887]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:28:49.288 --> 02:28:52.229]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:28:52.549 --> 02:28:55.109]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:55.470 --> 02:29:00.291]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:00.671 --> 02:29:06.033]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:06.333 --> 02:29:09.314]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:29:09.494 --> 02:29:10.074]  We're good to go.
[02:29:32.905 --> 02:29:33.146]  We're good.
[02:29:45.430 --> 02:29:52.213]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:29:52.594 --> 02:29:58.977]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:29:59.457 --> 02:30:09.362]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:30:09.842 --> 02:30:13.304]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:30:13.604 --> 02:30:16.286]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:30:16.927 --> 02:30:19.629]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[02:31:07.084 --> 02:31:08.405]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:08.465 --> 02:31:14.008]  Paul Grudy was born in Washington, Kansas, February 22, 1919.
[02:31:15.289 --> 02:31:19.092]  After high school and college, Paul graduated from Williams Institute of Mortuary Science.
[02:31:19.132 --> 02:31:24.155]  He enlisted in the United States Army and became a chaplain's assistant, was in the Battle of the Bulge, and then a surgical technician.
[02:31:24.675 --> 02:31:26.817]  After being honorably discharged, he returned to civilian life.
[02:31:27.443 --> 02:31:37.609]  To build cemeteries, homes, and mortuaries, Paul was the licensed undertaker at the funeral director in charge of the burial, subsequent exhumation, and reburial of Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:31:38.029 --> 02:31:41.171]  And you can just type Paul Grudy into the search engine and read all about him.
[02:31:42.802 --> 02:31:53.287]  There are different encyclopedia entries, you name it, the Lee Harvey Oswald research page, and a lot more online by searching the keywords Paul Grudy together.
[02:31:53.767 --> 02:31:56.669]  Okay, Paul, this is such a big deal, I want to walk through this slower.
[02:31:57.209 --> 02:32:10.335]  Describe that day, what you've been doing, if you remember, when the Secret Service came in, what they said to you, where the body was, what they had the rifle in, what they said the rifle was, in detail, as much detail as you can give us, walk through it slowly.
[02:32:13.516 --> 02:32:24.782]  Alex, I knew that we were probably going to be harassed when I would walk out back of the funeral home.
[02:32:24.962 --> 02:32:31.045]  We counted 1,300 cameras back there behind us in our parking lot.
[02:32:31.545 --> 02:32:33.226]  We knew we would be harassed.
[02:32:33.606 --> 02:32:51.711]  When the Secret Service said, we're coming and we're going to want to make a print off of the hand of the man that you have, and we're going to blacken his hand and all, and I said, well you guys be careful back there because I'm going to bury him and I don't want that black all over all his clothes and everything.
[02:32:52.071 --> 02:32:52.791]  So they did.
[02:32:52.851 --> 02:32:53.571]  They were careful.
[02:32:53.751 --> 02:32:55.872]  Now, they took a handprint
[02:32:56.864 --> 02:33:04.177]  And took his hand and put it against the butt of the rifle that was supposed to be the rifle that this man used.
[02:33:05.109 --> 02:33:07.851]  I don't know if it was the real one or what it was.
[02:33:07.871 --> 02:33:08.731]  Do you remember their names?
[02:33:08.831 --> 02:33:09.552]  No.
[02:33:09.572 --> 02:33:10.352]  How were they holding it?
[02:33:10.372 --> 02:33:11.313]  Was it in a box?
[02:33:11.333 --> 02:33:13.114]  No, it was in a case.
[02:33:13.414 --> 02:33:14.254]  It was in a case.
[02:33:14.294 --> 02:33:15.695]  So they came in and took it out?
[02:33:15.855 --> 02:33:25.421]  Took it out and blackened his hand and pressed his hand on the butt of that gun exactly as a man would hold it.
[02:33:25.481 --> 02:33:31.845]  Now, a dead human remains that had been embalmed, which I did, and did a
[02:33:32.785 --> 02:33:40.752]  A little more than normal, as far as embalming was concerned, because I knew they might want to look at him again in the future, because of that.
[02:33:41.032 --> 02:33:46.156]  It would be hard to really get a good print, so we don't know how good a print it is.
[02:33:46.176 --> 02:33:46.916]  Because of rigor mortis?
[02:33:47.177 --> 02:33:49.258]  Oh yeah, yeah, and because of embalming.
[02:33:49.298 --> 02:33:50.019]  Talk about rigor mortis.
[02:33:50.099 --> 02:33:53.502]  Well, rigor will set in shortly after death.
[02:33:54.262 --> 02:33:57.625]  When it does, everything has become rigid and firm.
[02:33:58.466 --> 02:34:01.008]  You can tell how long a body has been
[02:34:01.608 --> 02:34:02.328]  I think so.
[02:34:20.055 --> 02:34:22.157]  Just an hour and a half later and he was already getting stiff.
[02:34:22.217 --> 02:34:22.717]  That's right.
[02:34:23.397 --> 02:34:28.341]  This is a part of what happens to people and that's what happened in combat.
[02:34:28.421 --> 02:34:35.546]  Boys that had been hit and we didn't know how long they'd been hit, but we knew that Rygard had been hit sometime earlier.
[02:34:35.866 --> 02:34:38.368]  So you never know what's going on.
[02:34:38.708 --> 02:34:43.852]  But we definitely knew that they were going to do this and I was careful
[02:34:44.332 --> 02:34:50.238]  To make sure that they would do it in a manner that would be proper and they did.
[02:34:50.258 --> 02:34:51.379]  It seemed like to me.
[02:34:51.399 --> 02:34:52.680]  So where was his body described?
[02:34:52.720 --> 02:34:57.144]  Well, we have, and I think this is an interesting tale.
[02:34:58.786 --> 02:35:04.211]  Alex, there was a man that passed away in a rest home by the name of Bobo.
[02:35:04.951 --> 02:35:15.233]  Mr. Bobo and the lady who was in charge of the rest home said, Mr. Bobo died and Paul would you come and get his body and then bomb him and bury him.
[02:35:15.693 --> 02:35:16.673]  And I said, I'll do it.
[02:35:16.733 --> 02:35:27.875]  And she said, now he had four $100 bills in his boot because he was an old cowboy and the boot had a hole in it and it had four holes.
[02:35:27.935 --> 02:35:30.636]  That's a bigger hole, smaller, smaller, smaller.
[02:35:31.196 --> 02:35:31.577]  I think so.
[02:35:49.904 --> 02:35:52.886]  Everybody that looked, they would say, is that Oswald?
[02:35:52.966 --> 02:35:56.868]  I would say, because I'd open the door to go in there, and they'd say, is that Oswald?
[02:35:56.948 --> 02:35:58.689]  I'd say, no, that's Mr. Bobo.
[02:35:59.169 --> 02:36:07.474]  And all this time, I used Bobo to hide the fact that I had Oswald, because we didn't know what was going to happen to us.
[02:36:08.074 --> 02:36:16.919]  We knew good and well that if Secret Service came, they would come, and they went to Table 1, where Oswald was, put that hand mark on him,
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:19.161]  We don't know how it turned out.
[02:36:19.322 --> 02:36:20.904]  We don't know what happened to the gun.
[02:36:20.944 --> 02:36:21.524]  But you were there.
[02:36:21.564 --> 02:36:22.646]  You saw them put the hand on it.
[02:36:22.666 --> 02:36:23.066]  Oh, yes.
[02:36:23.146 --> 02:36:25.730]  Oh, there's no question about it that that's what they did.
[02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:26.911]  Well, I mean, obviously, here's the issue.
[02:36:26.951 --> 02:36:30.936]  They then ran out and told the media that they found his fingerprints on the gun.
[02:36:31.397 --> 02:36:31.677]  Yes.
[02:36:32.158 --> 02:36:33.159]  Well... Can you speak about that?
[02:36:33.899 --> 02:36:35.360]  I have no knowledge of that.
[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:39.783]  Well, you know, the Warren Commission and others have said that his fingerprints have been found on the gun.
[02:36:39.843 --> 02:36:40.463]  Yes, that's right.
[02:36:40.483 --> 02:36:41.184]  Can you speak about that?
[02:36:41.464 --> 02:36:44.606]  Well, if they found that, that's what they were doing.
[02:36:44.686 --> 02:36:56.693]  They were making sure that his fingerprints were on the gun to prove that he was the one that actually used the gun to definitely make him to be the one who did the killing of President Kennedy.
[02:36:57.053 --> 02:36:58.634]  Does that look suspicious to you?
[02:36:59.326 --> 02:37:05.009]  Well, we've often wondered, really, if they were covering up, was it some connection?
[02:37:05.409 --> 02:37:07.410]  And Mama Oswald always said that.
[02:37:07.470 --> 02:37:11.393]  His mother always said, I don't believe that was my son that did the shooting.
[02:37:11.753 --> 02:37:13.534]  That it could have been somebody else.
[02:37:14.434 --> 02:37:20.878]  Now, they had claimed they were coming to get his fingerprints, but then they were trying to put the rigor mortis hand with the ink on the gun.
[02:37:21.118 --> 02:37:22.699]  Did you say, hey, why are you doing that?
[02:37:22.959 --> 02:37:24.600]  Well, no, I didn't question them.
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:28.902]  It was all right with me, whatever they did, as long as they cleaned it up after they got through.
[02:37:29.363 --> 02:37:30.464]  How many Secret Service men?
[02:37:31.326 --> 02:37:32.408]  If I remember it was three.
[02:37:33.308 --> 02:37:36.190]  And I'm not too sure that it was exactly Secret Service.
[02:37:36.250 --> 02:37:41.414]  It could have been some other branch of FBI or something else.
[02:37:41.434 --> 02:37:42.334]  But they said they were Secret Service.
[02:37:42.354 --> 02:37:43.655]  They said they were Secret Service.
[02:37:43.695 --> 02:37:47.838]  But they showed me badges, so they proved that they were the people.
[02:37:47.918 --> 02:37:52.521]  But you never know, this day and time, who's who, when you are around that sort of thing.
[02:37:52.561 --> 02:37:53.742]  And after all, I've been around it.
[02:37:54.943 --> 02:37:57.745]  Ambulance business was a part of our business, too.
[02:37:57.985 --> 02:38:00.707]  And being around that all the time, we were requested
[02:38:01.567 --> 02:38:02.408]  No question about it.
[02:38:02.448 --> 02:38:06.751]  We had to check and make sure we were talking to a real policeman or whatever it might be.
[02:38:07.031 --> 02:38:09.432]  How long did it take you to get the ink off his hand?
[02:38:09.612 --> 02:38:18.257]  Well, I don't remember now, but of course we have cosmetics and I felt as though the cosmetics would probably cover it up and it did pretty well cover everything up.
[02:38:18.518 --> 02:38:23.200]  We didn't have any real problem with it because his hand is down and covered up with his
[02:38:24.721 --> 02:38:27.283]  Did they have an open casket at his funeral?
[02:38:38.346 --> 02:38:40.867]  Now, why was his body later exhumed?
[02:38:40.887 --> 02:38:44.568]  We know a controversy erupted because there had been three different people using Oswald's name.
[02:38:44.588 --> 02:38:47.469]  There had been a police officer who looked just like him who had been shot.
[02:38:47.489 --> 02:38:51.470]  I mean, is that why it led to the exhumation?
[02:38:51.490 --> 02:38:54.691]  You'd also talked about former head of British intelligence calling you.
[02:38:55.191 --> 02:38:56.411]  You left off there, but start over.
[02:38:56.812 --> 02:38:59.913]  Mr. Bobo, I mean...
[02:39:01.773 --> 02:39:12.245]  Michael Eddowes is an English author that wrote a book about it and because of that they wanted to know if I could disinter his remains so they could look at him again.
[02:39:12.646 --> 02:39:16.150]  So this is what the process was and Mr. Bobo
[02:39:16.770 --> 02:39:22.255]  I mean, Mr. Eddowes, Michael Eddowes, said that he was going to come over and that he'd pay the bill if they'd dig him up.
[02:39:22.655 --> 02:39:25.998]  And I said, well, if you're going to pay the bill, I'll get a permit.
[02:39:26.058 --> 02:39:26.719]  And I did.
[02:39:26.859 --> 02:39:31.703]  I went to the wife, went to Marina and got her to do it.
[02:39:32.043 --> 02:39:34.084]  She's a lovely, lovely person.
[02:39:34.164 --> 02:39:36.605]  And by the way, she believes it was a government op.
[02:39:36.705 --> 02:39:44.028]  Yes, they are all, you know... You know, we had her number, but then she got divorced and moved out of the Dallas area.
[02:39:44.109 --> 02:39:45.169]  Are you still in contact with her?
[02:39:45.489 --> 02:39:46.350]  No, not at all.
[02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:48.290]  We're trying to get in contact with her, if somebody can help us.
[02:39:48.350 --> 02:39:49.851]  Even Mars doesn't know how to get hold of her now.
[02:39:49.891 --> 02:39:53.393]  Yeah, it's... I talked to her just a few years ago, and now I've lost contact.
[02:39:53.473 --> 02:39:56.734]  She doesn't like to be bothered about it, I'll guarantee you that.
[02:39:57.314 --> 02:40:00.616]  She's very nice people, and just one of those things that...
[02:40:00.936 --> 02:40:03.538]  I have no reason to hunt her up.
[02:40:16.105 --> 02:40:16.365]  Right.
[02:40:16.826 --> 02:40:20.247]  And he said, I'll pay the bill if you dig him up.
[02:40:20.627 --> 02:40:21.388]  So I did.
[02:40:21.408 --> 02:40:22.689]  I got the permit.
[02:40:22.989 --> 02:40:26.030]  I went to the state and got my permit.
[02:40:27.171 --> 02:40:32.654]  The man who helped me get it done, Mr. Carroll, was in charge and I knew him from experience.
[02:40:33.094 --> 02:40:35.375]  He gave me a permit.
[02:40:35.555 --> 02:40:40.778]  I went out, dug him up, brought his vault to the surface.
[02:40:41.443 --> 02:40:45.685]  When we opened the vault, it was a steel-reinforced concrete vault.
[02:40:45.885 --> 02:40:50.226]  It weighed 2,700 pounds, so it's not just a little flimsy thing.
[02:40:50.707 --> 02:40:53.107]  It was broken, and we don't know why.
[02:40:53.127 --> 02:40:53.167]  Oh!
[02:40:55.268 --> 02:40:58.149]  And because of the fact that... What did the break look like?
[02:40:58.309 --> 02:41:02.711]  Well, it was a typical dead human remains, I'll guarantee you.
[02:41:02.771 --> 02:41:07.933]  It had been recently... I mean, it had originally been broken.
[02:41:08.033 --> 02:41:10.474]  It seemed like shortly after I buried him.
[02:41:10.894 --> 02:41:24.103]  Now, one tale that goes with this that I think is interesting, if nothing else, the man who ran the cemetery, he committed suicide some years later.
[02:41:24.243 --> 02:41:25.724]  And I said, I knew that man.
[02:41:25.784 --> 02:41:27.906]  I can't believe that he would commit suicide.
[02:41:28.513 --> 02:41:28.593]  Yeah.
[02:41:45.382 --> 02:41:46.162]  To commit suicide.
[02:41:46.182 --> 02:41:47.803]  Have you ever experienced that?
[02:41:47.843 --> 02:41:48.904]  That's not possible.
[02:41:49.984 --> 02:41:57.068]  He was evidently knew too much about who got into that grave after I buried him.
[02:41:57.548 --> 02:42:00.930]  We don't know what happened or why they wanted in the grave.
[02:42:01.210 --> 02:42:02.451]  Who's going to prove what?
[02:42:02.691 --> 02:42:05.713]  Were they going to steal body parts or what are they going to do?
[02:42:06.033 --> 02:42:07.133]  We have no knowledge.
[02:42:07.954 --> 02:42:10.235]  From that has stemmed a lot of
[02:42:11.337 --> 02:42:11.877]  Question.
[02:42:12.317 --> 02:42:13.118]  Who he was?
[02:42:13.538 --> 02:42:15.719]  Was it Oswald, really?
[02:42:15.999 --> 02:42:17.179]  And this sort of thing.
[02:42:17.739 --> 02:42:18.139]  I know.
[02:42:18.319 --> 02:42:19.580]  I buried Lee Harvey.
[02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:21.841]  Now, let's be specific about this vault.
[02:42:22.161 --> 02:42:28.223]  Was this a concrete sarcophagi that had another coffin inside of it?
[02:42:28.243 --> 02:42:29.863]  Yes, it had the casket inside of it.
[02:42:29.903 --> 02:42:31.344]  Can you detail the materials?
[02:42:31.784 --> 02:42:34.445]  I mean, talk about the larger sarcophagi and the smaller sarcophagi.
[02:42:34.705 --> 02:42:38.688]  Yeah, well now the smaller is not anything that's sealed.
[02:42:40.009 --> 02:42:42.371]  The cheap casket is what it really was.
[02:42:42.451 --> 02:42:45.794]  It's a number 31 from the casket cups.
[02:42:45.814 --> 02:42:47.135]  Is that wood or metal?
[02:42:47.235 --> 02:42:49.657]  Wood and cloth covered wood.
[02:42:50.518 --> 02:42:53.000]  Very inexpensive as far as caskets go.
[02:42:53.420 --> 02:42:58.204]  Now because of that I did not spend a lot of money for that family.
[02:42:58.764 --> 02:43:00.666]  Robert, the brother, said I will pay the bill.
[02:43:00.746 --> 02:43:00.986]  I said
[02:43:02.057 --> 02:43:02.597]  I think so.
[02:43:22.931 --> 02:43:23.812]  Thank you for having me.
[02:43:39.984 --> 02:43:43.147]  Matter of fact, the lid that was on that was one of the lids that I... That's right.
[02:43:43.167 --> 02:43:44.328]  You're quite an entrepreneur.
[02:43:44.348 --> 02:43:45.069]  So is your son.
[02:43:45.970 --> 02:43:47.651]  Well, it led into a lot of things.
[02:43:48.372 --> 02:43:51.294]  Building cemeteries, building homes, building buildings and all.
[02:43:52.035 --> 02:43:55.798]  We definitely knew that if we dug him up, it ought to be alright.
[02:43:56.098 --> 02:43:59.702]  But it turned out that vault was actually broken and they're not supposed to bury him.
[02:43:59.762 --> 02:44:01.283]  Now, let's talk about that vault plan.
[02:44:01.503 --> 02:44:02.164]  How was it broken?
[02:44:02.184 --> 02:44:03.004]  What did it look like?
[02:44:03.025 --> 02:44:04.566]  Did it look like it had been jimmyed to you?
[02:44:04.766 --> 02:44:05.066]  Yes.
[02:44:05.086 --> 02:44:06.327]  Say that in your own words.
[02:44:06.508 --> 02:44:17.698]  Well, the fact that when we put it into the grave it was solid, it was cured, it was solid concrete, it was not anything cheap.
[02:44:17.818 --> 02:44:20.140]  It's a good heavy-weighted thing.
[02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:21.041]  When we
[02:44:21.781 --> 02:44:31.503]  Dougie Bump, that lid had been broken, the vault itself had been broken, showing that somebody had done something, and we have no knowledge who it was.
[02:44:31.523 --> 02:44:32.724]  How was it broken?
[02:44:32.744 --> 02:44:33.264]  Describe that.
[02:44:33.444 --> 02:44:42.966]  Well, the sides are cracked, and the lid, the part of the casket was off to the side inside.
[02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:45.281]  The body had been disturbed.
[02:44:45.301 --> 02:44:47.122]  So it looked like this had been done hurriedly.
[02:44:47.762 --> 02:44:48.263]  Hurriedly.
[02:44:48.343 --> 02:44:49.564]  That's absolutely true.
[02:44:49.764 --> 02:44:52.485]  And then the man who was running the facility, he magically died.
[02:44:52.685 --> 02:44:54.046]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:44:54.066 --> 02:44:55.047]  17 stab wounds.
[02:44:55.107 --> 02:44:56.908]  Yes, that was... Supposed suicide.
[02:44:56.928 --> 02:44:57.869]  Yes, suicide.
[02:44:57.889 --> 02:45:00.770]  We've had people have their arms and legs cut off and they claim it's suicide.
[02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:02.812]  Well, yeah, there's no question about it.
[02:45:03.272 --> 02:45:06.674]  Being in my business all these years, I've seen a lot of things and that's one thing.
[02:45:06.934 --> 02:45:08.055]  We always kind of wonder about it.
[02:45:08.075 --> 02:45:09.375]  And do you know who takes care of all of that?
[02:45:09.395 --> 02:45:10.616]  The poor undertaker.
[02:45:24.622 --> 02:45:33.845]  I have been there hundreds and hundreds of times because we are the ones that have to go clean up the mess with a suicide or with a murder and all of that.
[02:45:33.885 --> 02:45:36.546]  So you have to respect the old guy who's been at it.
[02:45:36.566 --> 02:45:37.286]  It's a tough job.
[02:45:37.326 --> 02:45:38.567]  I couldn't imagine having to do it.
[02:45:38.607 --> 02:45:40.707]  You have to have a strong stomach, I'll tell you.
[02:45:41.108 --> 02:45:46.369]  And because of the fact that people now here just heard it this morning.
[02:45:46.409 --> 02:45:48.210]  Somebody's going to have to have an autopsy.
[02:45:48.610 --> 02:45:49.651]  I know what takes place.
[02:45:49.691 --> 02:45:52.592]  My wife asked me the other day when I heard somebody talking about it.
[02:45:52.952 --> 02:45:54.193]  She said, you're sure quiet.
[02:45:54.213 --> 02:45:59.175]  And I said, well, I'm going through what they're probably going through with this autopsy they're going to perform.
[02:45:59.235 --> 02:46:05.918]  Let's go back to, so the wooden coffin was open inside, the larger sarcophagus that had the top knocked off.
[02:46:07.278 --> 02:46:09.059]  What did the body, what was the condition of the body?
[02:46:09.099 --> 02:46:15.862]  Well, it's a typical 17 years of being exposed to the elements is the way it turns out.
[02:46:15.982 --> 02:46:18.043]  Because by simply opening it, it destroyed the remains.
[02:46:18.083 --> 02:46:18.684]  That's it.
[02:46:19.744 --> 02:46:21.085]  You speak to that probably being the end.
[02:46:21.145 --> 02:46:32.072]  Well, just the fact that if I go out into the woods and get a body that's been out in the woods a long time, you know it's going to end up to be nothing but a skeleton, because that's all that is left.
[02:46:32.553 --> 02:46:36.815]  And it's nearly always disturbed and distributed around in the area.
[02:46:37.095 --> 02:46:42.479]  But if they've left intact, their jaw is down on their chest, typical.
[02:46:43.199 --> 02:46:43.820]  I think.
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:12.804]  But if they didn't want somebody to be able to exhume and do another autopsy, to really find out identity or something, they'd want it to rot.
[02:47:13.044 --> 02:47:13.665]  That's it.
[02:47:14.165 --> 02:47:14.686]  That's it.
[02:47:15.486 --> 02:47:19.409]  We knew good and well that somebody had been there, didn't know what they were doing.
[02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:20.870]  Was it a clothing life, or was it all that?
[02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:24.893]  Well, that clothing isn't, after that many years, is gone.
[02:47:24.953 --> 02:47:26.614]  It's nothing, shreds anyway.
[02:47:27.115 --> 02:47:33.039]  And they, we took that body after the autopsy, I mean after we'd exhumed him.
[02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:44.617]  We took him to Parkland, where a pathologist and the assistants and all took care of it and made a total record of what it appeared to be.
[02:47:45.037 --> 02:47:50.721]  And the weird part of it was, this man had been autopsied, therefore his skull had been capped.
[02:47:51.201 --> 02:47:51.641]  I think so.
[02:48:18.289 --> 02:48:19.269]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.623 --> 02:48:48.683]  A new world order.
[02:48:49.404 --> 02:48:53.645]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:54.285 --> 02:48:56.426]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:57.106 --> 02:48:59.347]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:48:59.887 --> 02:49:02.348]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.088 --> 02:49:10.391]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:13.433 --> 02:49:18.396]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:18.877 --> 02:49:22.359]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:22.759 --> 02:49:25.241]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:25.301 --> 02:49:26.282]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:26.302 --> 02:49:27.242]  They're not after money.
[02:49:27.262 --> 02:49:28.323]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:28.543 --> 02:49:29.384]  They're after power.
[02:49:29.524 --> 02:49:30.645]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:49:53.935 --> 02:49:55.256]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:55.436 --> 02:49:58.816]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:55.871]  You need the SacroEggie Sacral Stabilizer.
[02:50:56.151 --> 02:50:59.733]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle.
[02:50:59.893 --> 02:51:00.693]  Yes, that's right.
[02:51:00.753 --> 02:51:05.775]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:09.636]  Gravity does the work with the SacroEggie under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[02:51:09.836 --> 02:51:11.857]  Help correct posture to help relieve the pain.
[02:51:12.097 --> 02:51:13.938]  Better balance equals fewer problems.

[02:51:17.281 --> 02:51:22.644]  This device has been helping people for the past 15 years, yet the cost is still just $29.95.
[02:51:22.864 --> 02:51:25.926]  Finally, something available that really relieves those stubborn aches and pains.

[02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:16.981]  Then we have the latest info from the Ron Paul campaign.
[02:52:17.825 --> 02:52:19.186]  With the head of the campaign joining us.
[02:52:19.506 --> 02:52:21.067]  Ron Paul's going to be on next week.
[02:52:21.087 --> 02:52:21.647]  I'll look after that.
[02:52:21.687 --> 02:52:23.869]  We're lining that up right now for you as well.
[02:52:24.189 --> 02:52:35.856]  And of course, I'll be back live this Sunday out of KLVJ 590 here in Austin and syndicated in great places like Kansas City, KCAA going into San Diego, and about 18 other affiliates.
[02:52:35.876 --> 02:52:36.676]  The show's really growing.
[02:52:36.717 --> 02:52:39.338]  We appreciate everybody tuning in to the Sunday Show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:39.358 --> 02:52:40.419]  Central, 5 to 7 p.m.
[02:52:40.439 --> 02:52:40.679]  Eastern.
[02:52:43.240 --> 02:52:47.582]  But you can also listen if you don't have an Amaranth affiliate at InfoWars.com as well.
[02:52:47.982 --> 02:52:55.466]  We'll be rebroadcast of this show when it ends in about four minutes until Sunday evening when we go live again at four o'clock central.
[02:52:55.506 --> 02:53:00.208]  So the show restarts here in about five minutes at InfoWars.com at the stream.
[02:53:00.228 --> 02:53:01.368]  People say, well, where are these streams?
[02:53:01.408 --> 02:53:02.909]  You go to InfoWars.com.
[02:53:03.229 --> 02:53:05.790]  It says Mainstream, Backup Stream, Low Bitrate Stream.
[02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:10.192]  It restreams there 24 hours a day after the show ends in just a few minutes.
[02:53:10.832 --> 02:53:11.293]  I really am.
[02:53:37.295 --> 02:53:44.117]  I'm happy, Alex, to leave all that good stuff to you because you have it.
[02:53:45.357 --> 02:53:47.638]  It's what it takes to get the job done.
[02:53:48.278 --> 02:53:51.899]  Knowing good and well that we talked just the other day.
[02:53:51.999 --> 02:53:56.660]  My wife is a full-blooded Swede and her grandparents came from Sweden.
[02:53:57.320 --> 02:54:03.965]  Settled out by Round Rock, out by Hutto, had property out there, the Westberg family.
[02:54:03.985 --> 02:54:06.166]  The owner of this network is a Swede of Minnesota.
[02:54:06.306 --> 02:54:07.287]  That's good.
[02:54:08.288 --> 02:54:21.076]  They are great people and because my wife and I went to the museum in Round Rock, I mean in Georgetown, which now is set up, shows all of the old stuff.
[02:54:21.116 --> 02:54:24.999]  And of course these Swedes came over here because of the potato
[02:54:26.005 --> 02:54:33.109]  Uh, famine that was going on, so many of them, like the Irish did too, and that's where my family came from.
[02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:34.950]  I got a little bit of everything in there.
[02:54:34.970 --> 02:54:43.135]  Yeah, we have a river in Ireland by the name of the Grootie River, a bridge over it, the Grootie Bridge, and a roundabout to get to it.
[02:54:43.495 --> 02:54:51.160]  So we know it's the Grootie Roundabout, so we know the name Grootie over there, folks know it, not over here, because we're strangers.
[02:54:51.540 --> 02:54:52.841]  You were telling me about your daughter too.
[02:54:52.861 --> 02:54:59.206]  Well, our daughter happens to be a part of the display department of the Little Apple.
[02:55:00.152 --> 02:55:03.074]  Well, I recognize your son when I met him.
[02:55:29.311 --> 02:55:30.732]  Uh, Largo Vista.
[02:55:31.312 --> 02:55:32.893]  Uh, well, really, Jonestown.
[02:55:33.013 --> 02:55:36.194]  And he's got a mansion up there that's a gorgeous thing.
[02:55:36.214 --> 02:55:39.575]  Yeah, you guys are a classy family, and I really am honored to count you as friends.
[02:55:39.935 --> 02:55:41.276]  Mr. Groody, thank you for joining us.
[02:55:41.516 --> 02:55:44.537]  Well, thank you for being... You're the guy you are.
[02:55:44.597 --> 02:55:45.138]  You're great.
[02:55:45.598 --> 02:55:46.238]  I appreciate it.
[02:55:46.258 --> 02:55:46.938]  I want to say hi to your son.
[02:55:46.958 --> 02:55:47.879]  I know he's listening right now.
[02:55:47.919 --> 02:55:49.019]  And say hi to everybody else.
[02:55:49.319 --> 02:55:50.280]  Mr. Groody, thank you for joining us.
[02:55:50.380 --> 02:55:50.980]  Okay, buddy.
