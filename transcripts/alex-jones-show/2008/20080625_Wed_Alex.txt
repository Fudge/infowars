[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:16.086]  The next hour we have the founder of Architects and Engineers, Richard Gage, joining us, as well as Kevin Ryan.
[00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:19.029]  I'll tell you a little bit about both these guys.
[00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.830]  Richard Gage.
[00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:25.128]  I've been a practicing architect for 20 years.
[00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:27.429]  I've designed numerous fireproof steel frame buildings.
[00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.592]  He has performed construction administration services for a new $12 million high school campus.
[00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:39.595]  I've got both their bios here.
[00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:44.537]  In fact, I was just now reading Richard Gage's bio there.
[00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.219]  Kevin Ryan is an engineered
[00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:49.636]  He is a degreed engineer.
[00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:52.239]  He has a B.S.
[00:00:52.599 --> 00:01:04.533]  in chemicals, certified quality engineer, former site manager for Environmental Health Laboratories, a division of Underwater Laboratories, co-editor of the Journal of 9-11 Studies, contributing author of 9-11 and the American Empire, Volume 1.
[00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:24.819]  Intellectuals speak out, and he's a member of Scholars for 9-11 Truth, and I was just reading Richard Gage's bio about a practicing architect for 20 years, designed a bunch of steel frame, large buildings, and they both join us now, and I appreciate them coming on on such short notice.
[00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:29.485]  I have a story up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:30.986]  Leaked NIST documents.
[00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:33.547]  Unusual event before collapse of WTC7.
[00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:40.751]  Yesterday afternoon we learned about the huge multi-hundred page leaked NIST document.
[00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.452]  They've been delaying releasing it for year after year.
[00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:48.174]  They had given five different reasons the towers had fallen.
[00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:51.856]  They had given five different reasons that Building 7 had fallen.
[00:01:56.528 --> 00:02:01.634]  Now I tried to read over this yesterday and it seemed like it was contradicting itself.
[00:02:01.694 --> 00:02:05.098]  It seemed like it contradicted other partial reports they put out.
[00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.386]  I found a lot of interesting things in there but I'm not an architect or engineer so I thought why not actually get two experts up
[00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:14.709]  on this subject.
[00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:30.623]  First off, I do want to say that in my film, Truth Rising, we do have an interview with Richard Gage, so he is part of that new film that comes out July 4th as well at PrisonPlanet.tv and on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:32.145]  But going first to
[00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:51.347]  Kevin Ryan, because we haven't interviewed him in a long time, Kevin Ryan worked for Underwater Laboratories, found out about a report his company had done where they tested models of the buildings and it wasn't consistent with a collapse, a symmetrical collapse, these uneven fires.
[00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:56.751]  And so he leaked the document and then spoke out about it and they fired him.
[00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:01.594]  And so he joins us now.
[00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:02.435]  Thank you for coming on, sir.
[00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:04.187]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:04.908]  Good to be with you.
[00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:05.908]  Thank you.
[00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:22.054]  Break down a little bit about yourself, for those that don't know who you are, a little bit about what happened with Underwriting Laboratories, and then now this whole NIST saga, and then we'll bring Mr. Gage in with his comments as an architect, and a comment on this leaked NIST report.
[00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:23.355]  Okay.
[00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:32.138]  Well, yes, as you said, I was a top manager at one of the locations of Underwriters Laboratories, and I was fired for publicly questioning
[00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:40.448]  The NIST report, now this has been almost four years, when they had put out their draft final report in October of 2004.
[00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:58.157]  And as you said, I was questioning that report because underwriter laboratories had told me, both verbally and in writing, that they had tested the steel components for the World Trade Center for fire resistance, which is one of the things they do.
[00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:04.075]  In fact, they had actually tested the steel components of the columns.
[00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:07.055]  They had tested the fireproofing itself.
[00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:15.837]  As stated by the president of the company who made the fireproofing in the New York Times, he said, Underwriters Laboratories tested it and certified it, so it shouldn't have failed.
[00:04:17.137 --> 00:04:23.239]  They also tested assemblies that were similar to the floors used in the World Trade Center.
[00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:24.659]  All this done 40 years ago.
[00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.180]  So I was questioning Underwriters Laboratories about how those buildings could have possibly
[00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:41.790]  been destroyed in that manner, and ended up writing a letter to NIST and telling them that their results clearly were not supporting their conclusions, and how could this be?
[00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.691]  And got fired for it.
[00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:53.693]  Now that was almost four years ago, as I said, so I've been doing quite a bit to learn more about what happened at the World Trade Center.
[00:04:53.813 --> 00:04:56.974]  And if I might interrupt, Kevin Ryan,
[00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:05.194]  As an engineer, you had a responsibility to talk about this and expose this, working there and seeing this internal secret report.
[00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:09.616]  And then we look at how the mainstream media and the debunkers won't touch you with a ten-foot pole.
[00:05:10.036 --> 00:05:13.777]  They ignore the fact that they're internal studies of those that underwrote the building.
[00:05:14.258 --> 00:05:18.399]  The experts, the world experts, were saying that something fishy was going on.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.661]  And so right there we should have a real investigation.
[00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:23.141]  Instead we get these whitewashes.
[00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:24.682]  The debunkers act like
[00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:43.092]  We're just here making all this up, and it's completely normal to have three buildings, two of them explode top-down with pyroclastic flows of dust, ejecting steel beams 50 yards, 100 yards, and then to have Building 7 fall perfectly into its own footprint, that that's just a regular occurrence.
[00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:47.894]  And then now, I'm looking at their own report, and it shows fires on one side of the building.
[00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:49.995]  How does that cause a symmetrical collapse?
[00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:54.398]  So now bring us up to what's happening with this new report.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.220]  Yeah, that's a good find.
[00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:06.223]  You know, back about six months ago, NIST had a meeting in which they started to tell us that their objective didn't include determining how the fire started.
[00:06:06.263 --> 00:06:09.164]  They were just going to talk about how the fires propagated.
[00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:13.905]  And this was a meeting that our friend Richard Gage spoke up as a public commenter.
[00:06:15.426 --> 00:06:18.226]  So they started telling us they didn't have to determine how the fire started.
[00:06:19.287 --> 00:06:21.887]  They talked about maybe the fireproofing just didn't work.
[00:06:21.927 --> 00:06:24.248]  They started saying these are really absurd things.
[00:06:25.557 --> 00:06:34.064]  But one thing they did say very clearly and all agreed with was that the fuel in any given location in the building lasted only about 20 minutes.
[00:06:34.745 --> 00:06:49.337]  So if you look at this report and you see that on the 13th floor some of these fires started around 2.30 or 3.00 and then they died down clearly and then there's this intense jet of flames that they can't explain at 5.20 right before the building collapsed.
[00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:51.779]  You know, all that leads to
[00:06:52.662 --> 00:07:02.925]  Some serious question about where these fires come from, and that leads us back to the finding, and what we do know is that thermite materials were present at the World Trade Center.
[00:07:03.745 --> 00:07:07.646]  And thermite materials are what are called pyrotechnic or energetic materials.
[00:07:07.746 --> 00:07:13.868]  It's kind of like gunpowder, where the fuel and the oxidizer are mixed together in one component.
[00:07:13.888 --> 00:07:16.269]  Thermite's like that, except it's much more powerful.
[00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:21.390]  And as we learn more from the dust, we start analyzing the dust in the laboratories that
[00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:26.610]  Participating in this, we're finding just what kind of thermite was used.
[00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:43.315]  And so I've done some of that laboratory work, and we seem to be finding that, interestingly, the materials that were present there are linked to a good number of those people who participated in the cover-up of NIST people.
[00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:48.617]  And people who participated in this report all have links to these
[00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:49.412]  It's
[00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:06.910]  What are called energetic nanocomposites.
[00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:12.533]  Wow, they just so happen, and you've got all the documents on that, and Professor Steven Jones has talked about it.
[00:08:13.274 --> 00:08:27.381]  It just so happens with the scientific method, you backtrack all this, and then, lo and behold, the very few groups involved in these materials are the very people cleaning up the mess, and the very people that were charged with covering it up.
[00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.103]  Boy, that really sounds like a whodunit.
[00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:40.598]  Really is, and I tell you what, the more we look at this, and along with the parallel investigation, which is kind of, who possibly could have had access to these kinds of materials?
[00:08:40.938 --> 00:09:00.301]  And just looking into the connections and so forth, we find that given who we know had access to the buildings, the Kroll Company, and the Securicom Company, and Marsh-McClelland, you know, companies that either established the security for the buildings, or were tenants in the particular areas that had failure.
[00:09:01.155 --> 00:09:06.037]  And we also look at who had access to the types of materials we're finding in the World Trade Center dust.
[00:09:06.638 --> 00:09:11.620]  We're able to start patching together some really plausible explanations.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.262]  You know, not exact yet, but a small series of possibilities.
[00:09:18.143 --> 00:09:23.325]  And so companies like the Scientific Applications Incorporated, right?
[00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:24.966]  They were the company that...
[00:09:25.734 --> 00:09:27.336]  You know, I'm sure you know that company.
[00:09:27.717 --> 00:09:30.801]  This is the company that supplied the largest contingent of investigators to the
[00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:40.631]  To the NIST World Trade Center investigation outside of the government, per se.
[00:09:40.691 --> 00:09:43.434]  So there's a huge list of people in the NIST report.
[00:09:43.474 --> 00:09:44.354]  Yeah, but let's be clear.
[00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:50.760]  Underwriters did their own secret report and their own secret test and found that something went on and it wasn't the fires.
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:10:02.871]  And so now, obviously, if one scientific body of the real experts finds buildings they certified and they know something happened, now you get these new guys that come and say the opposite of physics
[00:10:03.351 --> 00:10:07.793]  Obviously, they're going to be on some type of take, and then you go look at it, and lo and behold, they are.
[00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:14.076]  Well, it sure looks like it, because, you know, just look at the top advisory committee for NIST.
[00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:22.919]  There's this guy named Forman Williams, a professor from UC San Diego, and he happens to be an expert on these kinds of hermetic materials, having written a number of papers.
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.762]  You don't see them on his website at UCSD, but they are out there on the net, and you can find
[00:10:29.232 --> 00:10:30.912]  These papers on ignition analysis.
[00:10:31.272 --> 00:10:37.314]  And then I've gone and looked at some of these individuals' political policies and they're big pro-Israel war hawks.
[00:10:37.694 --> 00:10:38.314]  Oh!
[00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:39.034]  Right.
[00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:49.056]  Or you take a look at James Abrahamson, who was a former director of NASA and has been a director of Securicom and Stratisec, along with Walker and Bush.
[00:10:49.937 --> 00:10:53.377]  And this guy, he looks rotten to the core.
[00:10:54.258 --> 00:10:55.598]  He's got associations with
[00:10:56.621 --> 00:11:04.124]  Not only Securicom, but this Crescent group that he runs with a guy who I happen to know personally, Osama Bin Laden, supposedly.
[00:11:04.985 --> 00:11:10.107]  And they have the Kroll company with Jerome Hauer and Brian Michael Jenkins.
[00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:15.089]  Line those people up with these groups like SAIC.
[00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.911]  SAIC is a company that Jerome Hauer worked for as well.
[00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:19.531]  It's a big defense contractor.
[00:11:19.671 --> 00:11:25.534]  Yeah, and so did this Stephen Hatfield guy who was associated with the Anthrax attack, right?
[00:11:25.871 --> 00:11:28.572]  And they specialize in really complex black ops.
[00:11:28.592 --> 00:11:29.453]  They brag about that.
[00:11:30.013 --> 00:11:30.533]  Absolutely.
[00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:34.175]  And so they are connected to these, also these high-tech thermitic materials.
[00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:35.176]  God help us.
[00:11:35.756 --> 00:11:36.396]  All right, folks.
[00:11:36.436 --> 00:11:39.778]  We're going to go ahead and talk during the break with the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:11:39.858 --> 00:11:40.818]  Time is of the essence.
[00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:45.921]  So go to Infowars.com, listen to the stream there, or watch online if you're going to hear the four minutes behind the scenes.
[00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:53.525]  If not, we'll be back with both Richard Gage and, of course, Kevin Ryan, both engineers, one of them an architect on the other side.
[00:11:55.396 --> 00:12:01.060]  I'm going to continue talking to my guest right now, behind the scenes for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:05.224]  That's just amazing information, Kevin Ryan, completely blew me away.
[00:12:05.244 --> 00:12:07.465]  I knew a lot of that, but the way you put it all together.
[00:12:07.766 --> 00:12:09.527]  Let's bring Richard Gage in.
[00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:16.452]  I want to bring this up now and then get back on the full discussion just about the science and the report that you've just had a few days to look at.
[00:12:17.433 --> 00:12:18.773]  I'm getting a lot of death threats now.
[00:12:18.933 --> 00:12:23.394]  Very serious ones getting followed, getting a lot of other crazy, you know, threats to my family.
[00:12:23.695 --> 00:12:26.395]  Things that we know are of a government nature, not the normal type.
[00:12:26.895 --> 00:12:28.216]  A lot of other people are getting those.
[00:12:28.236 --> 00:12:31.296]  We're also getting public Michael Reagan saying murder us, kill us.
[00:12:31.676 --> 00:12:33.617]  National shows are saying murder us, kill us.
[00:12:34.097 --> 00:12:36.177]  I think we're getting really close and they're scared.
[00:12:36.578 --> 00:12:37.638]  A, your comments on that.
[00:12:37.778 --> 00:12:41.259]  B, Richard Gage and Kevin Ryan, are you getting threats?
[00:12:43.479 --> 00:12:43.939]  Oh, hi, Kev.
[00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:44.820]  Hey, Richard.
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.480]  Hello, Alex.
[00:12:47.386 --> 00:12:51.028]  Great to hear your voice again, and Kevin, great to hear yours as well.
[00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:53.070]  Yeah, good to hear from you.
[00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.332]  Yeah.
[00:12:57.252 --> 00:13:00.894]  I have not received any death threats, fortunately.
[00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:02.335]  I'm not looking forward to it.
[00:13:03.276 --> 00:13:06.758]  And I'd like to pretend that I'm going to be immune from that.
[00:13:07.158 --> 00:13:10.760]  But I do sort of expect it.
[00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:13.102]  I think we are getting closer.
[00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:25.316]  Nick, this Friday or Saturday, I will be speaking to 40 state legislators at the Arizona Republican Assembly, and I'm very, very excited about that opportunity.
[00:13:25.756 --> 00:13:28.918]  I think that will raise a lot of attention.
[00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:36.783]  I have one hour, and I will lay out all of the evidence for the assisted collapses of all three high-rise buildings.
[00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:56.877]  Well, I know you just covered the science, and Ryan's always done that, but I like how you guys now are pointing out that the people who have access and are experts in these thermate-accelerated type systems, and Black Ops, and Al-Qaeda, I mean, you heard what Kevin Ryan was just talking about.
[00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:57.777]  Your comments on that?
[00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:03.141]  Yeah, I think Kevin is doing a critical job.
[00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:05.703]  I think at Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth,
[00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:22.487]  The 400 architects and engineers that we represent that are demanding a real investigation will maintain greater credibility by not pointing fingers and doing the kind of research that is so important for others to do, like Kevin.
[00:14:23.728 --> 00:14:24.228]  I agree with you.
[00:14:24.248 --> 00:14:27.629]  We're going to come back with you, Richard, on the other side, both of you together, but you first.
[00:14:27.989 --> 00:14:32.771]  But in the minute, we've got left in this little behind-the-scenes discussion for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:35.192]  Kevin Ryan, have you gotten any threats?
[00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:41.059]  No, I haven't gotten any death threats, you know, occasionally, and actually fairly frequently.
[00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:51.928]  I can't use my email, but I think I was, at best, I was harassed by the IRS right after I was fired, but no death threats, and hopefully that won't occur, but we'll see.
[00:14:52.528 --> 00:14:55.511]  Well, you're familiar with Michael Reagan saying, kill 9-11 truthers, right?
[00:14:55.831 --> 00:14:56.492]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:57.355 --> 00:15:01.296]  Yeah, I think there's a real possibility that we're going to be able to piece together and pinpoint the organizations that have
[00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:27.155]  The highest probability if not the exact organizations involved in the crimes of 9-11.
[00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:30.423]  And people think I'd be happy about this.
[00:15:30.483 --> 00:15:31.303]  It's horrifying.
[00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:32.605]  I wish it was 19 guys.
[00:15:32.805 --> 00:15:39.691]  That's not 1,000th as scary as black ops and these big defense contractors.
[00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:41.513]  And they're not going to stop, folks.
[00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:43.575]  We have to expose this or they're going to do more.
[00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:46.077]  And I don't like picking a fight against the mass murderers.
[00:15:46.137 --> 00:15:49.520]  I mean, these guys are so wicked it would make your head spin.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:50.521]  Stay there, gentlemen.
[00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:51.902]  We're going live to the full audience right now.
[00:16:20.075 --> 00:16:21.316]  The enemy is committed.
[00:16:21.796 --> 00:16:23.837]  They're coming at us, bringing in world tyranny.
[00:16:24.898 --> 00:16:27.480]  Those of us that love liberty on the other side, we're committed.
[00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:32.409]  If you haven't fully committed, it's a great feeling like nothing on earth I've ever felt.
[00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.593]  It transcends even my love for my children, the other strongest feeling in my life.
[00:16:39.513 --> 00:16:40.674]  It transcends everything.
[00:16:40.714 --> 00:16:41.494]  It is timeless.
[00:16:43.676 --> 00:16:45.117]  You better ask yourselves, who are you?
[00:16:45.217 --> 00:16:46.237]  Whose side are you on?
[00:16:48.018 --> 00:16:48.478]  Commit!
[00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:50.700]  Jump into the fight!
[00:16:52.318 --> 00:16:53.479]  We're at a whole other level.
[00:16:54.279 --> 00:17:11.490]  Going back to Kevin Ryan, who valiantly found out their own reports in his own company, saying something happened on these buildings, the official story is a lie, and then he gets fired for releasing their secret report, and then now we've got all these black operators running the NIST report, and now they leak this internal report.
[00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.791]  Now do we know this is a real internal report?
[00:17:13.831 --> 00:17:15.672]  It sure looks like one.
[00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:17.133]  Richard Gage, any ideas on that?
[00:17:19.675 --> 00:17:20.195]  I don't know.
[00:17:20.834 --> 00:17:25.877]  Alex, and I've been unfortunately offline for the last three days, so I haven't... You've been traveling.
[00:17:25.897 --> 00:17:26.878]  What about you, Kevin?
[00:17:27.818 --> 00:17:37.244]  Well, it sure does look like it, Alex, and I was notified about these reports being available on the NIST website a month or so ago.
[00:17:37.964 --> 00:17:47.170]  I didn't download them myself because I was given the indication that NIST was threatening people who might do that, but they were obviously downloaded and leaked.
[00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:49.972]  By that, you mean people that know backdoors?
[00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:53.753]  Yeah, and FTP links and so forth.
[00:17:53.833 --> 00:17:55.534]  Yeah, they're just, the government's so stupid.
[00:17:55.874 --> 00:17:56.114]  Right.
[00:17:56.194 --> 00:17:58.855]  Look how they carry out the attacks and they can't even cover up their own info.
[00:18:00.155 --> 00:18:10.979]  Yeah, and it does look very interesting because they're obviously struggling, as we knew they would, with any kind of plausible explanation for how this building fell in six and a half seconds.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.740]  God, I wish it wasn't them.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.941]  Don't you ever wish, Kevin, it wasn't them?
[00:18:16.961 --> 00:18:19.262]  I mean, it's so much better if it was 19 guys.
[00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:30.225]  I don't know, I guess that's the easy way out in one sense, but on the other hand, if you think about the fact that the more you learn about this stuff, I know you know this Alex,
[00:18:31.824 --> 00:18:36.986]  The wars through history appear to have been started by lies, and that war is a racket, right?
[00:18:37.387 --> 00:18:47.551]  No, I know that, but it's one thing to blow up your ship when the guys are on leave, and that's bad enough, and start the war, or Hitler burning his own Reichstag, that didn't kill anybody.
[00:18:47.811 --> 00:18:51.033]  Or the Gulf of Tonkin, where they didn't kill anybody.
[00:18:52.353 --> 00:18:55.595]  Then they moved on to the Liberty, and now, it's just, why?
[00:18:56.775 --> 00:18:58.976]  Just to realize they really are killers.
[00:18:59.016 --> 00:18:59.876]  They really did do it.
[00:19:00.216 --> 00:19:03.118]  Scientists like you, architects, engineers have proven it.
[00:19:03.858 --> 00:19:06.439]  I mean, I knew it six and a half years ago.
[00:19:06.519 --> 00:19:07.499]  I knew it before it happened.
[00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:09.600]  I mean, because I saw the chatter and them getting ready.
[00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.161]  The point is to really know.
[00:19:11.181 --> 00:19:13.562]  I mean, to absolutely know you're right.
[00:19:13.762 --> 00:19:15.463]  You got to admit, I mean, does that take your breath away?
[00:19:15.483 --> 00:19:20.105]  It absolutely took my breath away five years ago.
[00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:24.726]  And my mind hasn't changed at all.
[00:19:24.767 --> 00:19:25.767]  I knew it immediately.
[00:19:26.482 --> 00:19:31.824]  I'll tell you what takes my breath away is the concern that if they pulled off whoever they are
[00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:54.065]  The 9-11, then they have the capability, the intent, and the motivation to pull off another one.
[00:19:54.806 --> 00:20:07.117]  There are more ships amassed in the Persian Gulf right now than there were prior to the Iraq invasion, and there are very well-known plans set for an invasion of Iran.
[00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:10.039]  And now you have this weird attempt on Sarkozy?
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.061]  I mean, stuff is just crazy!
[00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:15.993]  It's insane.
[00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:18.116]  And who will they blame the next one on?
[00:20:18.176 --> 00:20:20.260]  I mean, obviously, what will it be?
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.628]  We're promised, basically, by several members of the Bush administration, Congress, and
[00:20:26.107 --> 00:20:31.513]  The media of another 9-11 style attack worse than the last one.
[00:20:31.633 --> 00:20:32.334]  What will it be?
[00:20:32.374 --> 00:20:33.515]  A nuclear weapon?
[00:20:33.735 --> 00:20:39.341]  I have never in my gut, not just intellectually, man, I have never in my gut felt that we are in greater danger.
[00:20:39.602 --> 00:20:44.367]  Just as I intellectually analyze things and then ask my gut, you know, a gut check, it's like, whoa!
[00:20:44.507 --> 00:20:47.010]  I mean, are you guys getting the same feeling in your gut?
[00:20:50.273 --> 00:20:51.674]  Go ahead, Kevin, you have the best gut.
[00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:55.416]  I do have a bigger gut than you, Richard, yes.
[00:20:55.576 --> 00:21:01.719]  And I'll tell you what, you know, there's only so much of the overwhelming fear that a person can deal with.
[00:21:01.759 --> 00:21:05.542]  So I think that right now our best bet is to focus.
[00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:08.803]  Just focus on facts and focus on... No, no, that's what I'm doing.
[00:21:08.883 --> 00:21:16.928]  I'm just saying with the geopolitical things, not even the false flag attacks, it's just everybody I talk to says they can feel we are on the edge of something big.
[00:21:17.328 --> 00:21:17.708]  Oh, yeah.
[00:21:17.808 --> 00:21:18.609]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:21:18.769 --> 00:21:23.492]  Okay, we're going to focus on the other side of this quick break with Kevin Ryan, Richard Gage.
[00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:24.633]  I'm going to give you guys the floor.
[00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:26.274]  I'm not going to be there for 30 minutes.
[00:21:26.314 --> 00:21:35.100]  I'm actually going to go shit out in the other studio so I can control myself and not make points because I want you guys to go back and forth and talk about whatever you think is most important.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.920]  I'll actually sit here.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.221]  I can shut up if I want to.
[00:21:37.521 --> 00:21:40.643]  We'll be right back with Kevin Ryan and Richard Gage.
[00:21:41.004 --> 00:21:42.364]  Kevin Ryan blew me away earlier.
[00:21:42.484 --> 00:21:42.965]  Unbelievable.
[00:21:45.586 --> 00:21:48.588]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:21:49.528 --> 00:21:52.310]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:55.212 --> 00:21:57.313]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[00:21:57.753 --> 00:22:03.917]  I've been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[00:22:05.011 --> 00:22:10.237]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with this.
[00:22:10.557 --> 00:22:16.664]  In the U.S., commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed, and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[00:22:17.425 --> 00:22:23.912]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[00:22:24.693 --> 00:22:25.774]  Remember our trade deficit?
[00:22:26.243 --> 00:22:31.265]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:37.668]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food and food exports under martial law.
[00:22:38.228 --> 00:22:39.669]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.

[00:22:54.972 --> 00:22:56.653]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:22:56.953 --> 00:23:00.375]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:23:00.556 --> 00:23:02.397]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:23:03.017 --> 00:23:05.739]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:11.522]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:23:11.802 --> 00:23:15.705]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:24:02.365 --> 00:24:04.646]  At LaysMedInc, the future is here.
[00:24:05.006 --> 00:24:08.468]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.

[00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:33.160]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.602]  To receive an information packet, call our treatment center at 501-255-0457.
[00:24:39.483 --> 00:24:39.923]  I think so.
[00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:16.753]  Okay, we've got the engineer Kevin Ryan on with us.
[00:25:16.773 --> 00:25:18.595]  The architect and engineer Richard Gage.
[00:25:20.176 --> 00:25:21.157]  Architect Richard Gage.
[00:25:21.577 --> 00:25:23.739]  Heads up architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.562]  400 plus members and growing.
[00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.731]  We'll give out their websites repeatedly before they leave us.
[00:25:30.771 --> 00:25:32.631]  There's links right now up on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:33.352 --> 00:25:49.297]  Gentlemen, for the next 30 minutes I want you to talk about whatever issues you want to, whatever you think is most important, but I do want you now to address leaked NIS documents, unusual event before collapse of WTC, talk about fire shooting out of nowhere, they talk about fires being stronger before...
[00:25:50.293 --> 00:25:55.155]  Well yeah, the report, the clear finding in the report is the problem with the fires dying down and then suddenly
[00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:20.501]  Richard probably has a good take on the way the building fell and
[00:26:47.782 --> 00:26:49.983]  What the most important evidence physically is.
[00:26:50.003 --> 00:26:52.465]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:26:52.845 --> 00:27:03.291]  And also, with this new leak, NIST has apparently provided numerous additional photos that we have not seen before.
[00:27:04.232 --> 00:27:06.854]  Provided inadvertently, I should say, I guess.
[00:27:07.554 --> 00:27:14.698]  But they do not show any other damage to the building, other than these small fires from floors 7 to 13.
[00:27:16.431 --> 00:27:21.734]  And what's described as a relatively minimal scoop, that is, damage from World Trade Center North Tower.
[00:27:21.754 --> 00:27:24.535]  That's right, and it doesn't match other photos that have been circulated.
[00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:28.657]  I mean, they've shown buildings that have green faces or gray faces, saying it's Building 7.
[00:27:29.497 --> 00:27:30.978]  Do we know those are fake photos now?
[00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:39.802]  Well, most people in the 9-11 truth movement have agreed, and it's been shown, yeah, that those are faked photos.
[00:27:40.182 --> 00:27:43.244]  I don't... I guess they did come from NIST or through NIST.
[00:27:44.822 --> 00:27:52.947]  I'm not completely sure about that, but the evidence of them being forgeries is apparent and been made clear.
[00:27:52.967 --> 00:28:01.011]  I was going to talk about Building 7 and how it came down.
[00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:12.397]  Some people may yet be unaware that this is the third skyscraper that collapses, in this case, into virtually its own footprint.
[00:28:13.821 --> 00:28:15.362]  It was not hit by an airplane.
[00:28:15.982 --> 00:28:18.123]  We were just talking about the nature of the fires.
[00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:24.445]  They were virtually out by the time, at 520 in the afternoon of 9-11.
[00:28:25.165 --> 00:28:32.127]  And all of a sudden, there are witnesses hearing explosions at the base of the building.
[00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:35.528]  Kevin McPatton describes the ground shaking.
[00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:37.049]  You had to grab onto something.
[00:28:37.689 --> 00:28:40.130]  By the way, he also describes a countdown.
[00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:40.130]  3, 2, 1.
[00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.312]  And then these explosions.
[00:28:44.452 --> 00:28:49.036]  Now, do fires bring buildings down to countdowns?
[00:28:49.896 --> 00:28:50.577]  I don't think so.
[00:28:51.478 --> 00:28:57.162]  We also have Craig Bartmer of the New York Police Department saying, I think I know an explosion when I hear it.
[00:28:58.243 --> 00:29:02.947]  And so he's describing these explosions at the initiation of this collapse.
[00:29:03.768 --> 00:29:09.072]  And then let's talk about this collapse, because it happens precipitously.
[00:29:09.953 --> 00:29:22.456]  Well, first of all, there is a collapse about ten seconds prior to the global collapse of the East Penthouse itself, just imploding virtually straight down through itself.
[00:29:22.836 --> 00:29:38.279]  And then ten seconds later, the entire building, all of a sudden, virtually symmetrically and smoothly, drops straight down almost into its own footprint in about six and a half seconds.
[00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:47.391]  And it's been timed the first two seconds of that drop is indistinguishable in its pace from free fall.
[00:29:48.052 --> 00:29:50.415]  This is extremely important because it tells us
[00:29:51.061 --> 00:30:01.569]  That certainly, in the first two seconds, there's no resistance to this collapse from the 40,000 tons of structural steel that were designed, of course, to resist.
[00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:03.150]  Showing that it couldn't be a pancake.
[00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.273]  It wasn't a few floors falling and then causing the structure.
[00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:09.315]  It was free fall from the start of the collapse.
[00:30:10.196 --> 00:30:10.856]  That's correct.
[00:30:11.477 --> 00:30:13.478]  And how could such a thing happen?
[00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:19.263]  Well, the columns, the resistance, the steel columns have to be removed.
[00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:24.894]  And we're talking within a tenth of a second of each other, ideally, within the core structure.
[00:30:25.695 --> 00:30:30.656]  There's 24 core columns in Building 7.
[00:30:30.816 --> 00:30:40.259]  And then a half a second after that, the perimeter columns have to be removed within a tenth of a second of each other.
[00:30:40.619 --> 00:30:47.221]  Any problem in the timing of such a removal of columns, you begin to have an immediate
[00:30:48.496 --> 00:30:50.457]  Asymmetrical collapse going on.
[00:30:50.517 --> 00:30:55.579]  An angular momentum will take over as the building follows the path of least resistance.
[00:30:56.099 --> 00:31:03.262]  So there are plenty of failed, controlled demolitions where when it doesn't go right, you see the building going over.
[00:31:03.342 --> 00:31:05.983]  This is a science.
[00:31:06.263 --> 00:31:10.084]  And this is actually a beautiful example of that science.
[00:31:10.744 --> 00:31:14.226]  Fires cannot accomplish this because fire is asymmetrical.
[00:31:14.386 --> 00:31:15.126]  It's organic.
[00:31:15.786 --> 00:31:17.687]  A fire burns out an area of a building
[00:31:18.078 --> 00:31:21.359]  Every 20 minutes or so and moves on to another area.
[00:31:21.419 --> 00:31:27.340]  So when a building does collapse due to fire, what you have is clearly an asymmetrical collapse.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.281]  That is an edge or part of it falls down or a small area collapses.
[00:31:30.341 --> 00:31:31.921]  Not a perfect fall.
[00:31:32.822 --> 00:31:33.802]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:31:33.842 --> 00:31:35.962]  Mr. Ryan, any comments on that?
[00:31:37.783 --> 00:31:47.465]  Well, yeah, I think the comments on the damage are interesting because from the noise that NIST has been making in the last
[00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:49.061]  Six months to a year.
[00:31:49.101 --> 00:32:01.964]  It sounds like they're going to come up with a theory, roughly called a single point of failure, that author Ramon Gil-Santz, who's part of their investigation, published in a structural engineering magazine.
[00:32:02.904 --> 00:32:12.986]  What that means is they're going to find one column they think is very critical and somehow cause that to fail by fire, essentially to be the initiating event.
[00:32:16.735 --> 00:32:21.378]  Let's talk about that column for a minute, Kevin.
[00:32:21.699 --> 00:32:22.499]  It's column number 79.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:31.246]  And guess how much that column weighs on each of the floors that are said to be at the initiation of this event.
[00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:34.128]  It's 15,000 pounds per floor.
[00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:41.174]  That column has to be heated up to about 1,000 or 1,200 degrees in order to cause any failure.
[00:32:41.756 --> 00:32:47.739]  And let's be clear, this isn't just Richard Gage or Kevin Ryan's opinion.
[00:32:47.839 --> 00:32:52.102]  Underwriting laboratories, the big cheeses, did internal secret tests.
[00:33:00.699 --> 00:33:03.240]  And that's a question for you, Kevin Ryan.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.641]  Talking to your old colleagues when this was going on, I mean, they're scientists, they're engineers.
[00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:13.222]  I guess they're scared to lose their jobs, but what do they say when they can't release their own report?
[00:33:14.002 --> 00:33:21.483]  Well, we primarily talked about the towers, but their position was that they were helping NIST.
[00:33:21.623 --> 00:33:24.904]  NIST was their client in the investigation, which they did.
[00:33:24.964 --> 00:33:28.445]  They built these floor models for the towers and tested them in August 2004.
[00:33:30.163 --> 00:33:34.546]  So, as far as World Trade Center 7, we didn't really discuss that.
[00:33:34.586 --> 00:33:40.209]  They wouldn't even touch that one, as I think it's clear that NIST is having a good deal of trouble.
[00:33:41.049 --> 00:33:49.554]  But the point is, NIST hires underwriters to find out how they collapse, NIST says something's wrong, planes can't do this, and then NIST says, don't release that.
[00:33:52.596 --> 00:33:52.776]  Yeah.
[00:33:55.129 --> 00:34:00.452]  Underwriters Laboratories did perform tests as part of the NIST investigation, and that was included in their report.
[00:34:00.992 --> 00:34:10.395]  The tests that weren't included in their report that UL is denying existed were the tests that were done 40 years ago in preparation for building, constructing the buildings.
[00:34:11.016 --> 00:34:23.681]  But right now, they're trying to explain, without the help of Underwriters Laboratories, NIST is, how this one building now collapsed simply from fire and not from damage, which is kind of a twist, I would say.
[00:34:24.922 --> 00:34:29.243]  I don't know if you agree or not, Richard, but it seems to be kind of a change in course.
[00:34:30.944 --> 00:34:49.029]  Well, all of a sudden, what it means is if a 20-minute fire can take out a 15,000-pound column and cause the symmetrical free-fall collapse of 40,000 tons of structural steel, then all of our codes, not only in this country but throughout the world,
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.282]  are in grave jeopardy of all of a sudden being wrong.
[00:34:53.382 --> 00:34:57.064]  All of our fire science is wrong.
[00:34:57.765 --> 00:34:59.526]  All of the codes have to be changed.
[00:34:59.586 --> 00:35:01.947]  The buildings, all of them, have to be upgraded.
[00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:03.968]  None of this is being discussed.
[00:35:04.309 --> 00:35:17.116]  In fact, some suggestions by NIST for rewriting of codes are being categorically denied as necessary by the American Institute of Architects.
[00:35:18.086 --> 00:35:31.839]  Yeah, they're going to extreme lengths trying to come up with this story, and I think they're having a great... I think, frankly, Alex, I think that they're going to wait, as you might suggest, until we're too busy with too many other things to finally release this report.
[00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:36.022]  Yeah, it'll probably never be released.
[00:35:36.523 --> 00:35:39.586]  Well, I mean, let me go back here as a novice understanding this.
[00:35:41.903 --> 00:35:47.846]  We have them claiming now that the rules of science and engineering and architecture have changed.
[00:35:48.226 --> 00:35:52.508]  How are they going to get away with this with the rest of the scientific community?
[00:35:52.528 --> 00:35:54.710]  I guess that's a controversy that has begun.
[00:35:54.730 --> 00:36:01.513]  And then you've also got all of the debunkers running around saying that fire did it and boilers did it and the building falling into it did it.
[00:36:01.913 --> 00:36:04.455]  Now in this new report they're saying no, just fire.
[00:36:05.535 --> 00:36:20.788]  I want to zoom in on that point and get you guys to elaborate on that, that they're now backing off of many of their previous claims, and so I wonder what all these debunking programs are going to say.
[00:36:21.608 --> 00:36:31.777]  Well, we touched on the fact that the photographs in this report don't indicate any more damage than any of the other photographs do.
[00:36:32.463 --> 00:36:48.130]  So, you know, it's very likely they don't have photographs that show extensive damage to the building, so they have to back away from that story and now come up with some sort of a fire-only story for this 47-story building to collapse in six and a half seconds.
[00:36:48.731 --> 00:36:55.614]  And I can't imagine any story they can tell that will be sustainable in the eyes of the scientific community.
[00:36:56.974 --> 00:37:00.196]  Yeah, and the debunkers are having a very difficult time with this as a result.
[00:37:00.529 --> 00:37:05.351]  Because they took away two of their pieces of ammunition.
[00:37:06.092 --> 00:37:13.295]  Diesel fuel-fed flaps were said to have been a part of this, and yet NIST took that away.
[00:37:14.616 --> 00:37:21.299]  The only diesel fuel on the east side of the building where the initiation of collapse occurred is on the fifth floor, where the generators were.
[00:37:21.719 --> 00:37:28.362]  But the collapse, they're saying, occurred well above that, and there's no fire, no evidence of fire, on the fifth floor.
[00:37:30.273 --> 00:37:58.898]  was taken away and and of course uh... the damage from the north tower uh... was on the south side of the building and apparently not that expensive as uh... produce a new leaked documents and so that they took it they took that away there's no huge scoop out of the building is no evidence uh... of for that so we're we're we're we're left contemplating uh... what any fire protection engineer knows and that is a twenty minute fire and not
[00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:06.455]  Well, first of all, it couldn't even take out the trusses in the World Trade Center either, by the way, even un-fireproofed.
[00:38:06.996 --> 00:38:28.492]  And NIST, excuse me, Underwriter Laboratories actually documented that when they did their four tests of the 35 foot span mock truss composite steel decking samples that were made to mimic the assemblies in the World Trade Center.
[00:38:29.286 --> 00:38:32.247]  So, that was too much of a digression.
[00:38:32.767 --> 00:38:34.087]  No, that was a good point.
[00:38:34.408 --> 00:38:42.270]  One thing I want to make clear, Richard, and you were in this meeting, at least as a public commentator, is that the December meeting minutes are interesting.
[00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:49.792]  If you go to NIST and their World Trade Center website, you'll find the minutes, finally, they put out for the December 18th meeting they had.
[00:38:50.572 --> 00:38:53.973]  And they had some tough questioning, even from the advisory committee.
[00:38:54.293 --> 00:38:56.634]  Charles Thornton, who is an interesting character,
[00:38:57.316 --> 00:39:13.499]  On the advisory committee, he added sometime in the middle of the investigation, and he was one of the engineers that covered up the Oklahoma City disaster, was asking some pointed questions himself, saying, if you don't have fuel in World Trade Center 7, how could fires burn for as long as they did?
[00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:16.900]  And taking out this major structure that had good fireproofing.
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.481]  That's a pointed question.
[00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:22.101]  How could that possibly happen?
[00:39:23.055 --> 00:39:41.879]  And not only that, their preliminary hypothesis for the failure of Column 79 notes that Column 79 and many of the other core columns were designed to be laterally unsupported for three floors, all together.
[00:39:41.959 --> 00:39:52.241]  Three floors were moved 40 feet high, which means that not only would this fire have had to be taken out,
[00:39:53.328 --> 00:40:06.537]  Well, it means that the fire would have had to take out the beams that supported the floors, three of them in a row, before the column was unsupported enough to where it would then buckle.
[00:40:07.537 --> 00:40:19.705]  In other words, there is no plausible scenario whatsoever presented by anybody that can explain how Column 79 even failed.
[00:40:22.455 --> 00:40:38.503]  Well, I would say that if we get back to the fire that they're saying did exist at the moment, just before collapse, after all the office furnishings had burned up, all the fuel is gone, and still there's this fire, jets of flame shooting out the windows.
[00:40:39.324 --> 00:40:43.426]  That indicates that there's something other than normal fire there, right?
[00:40:43.446 --> 00:40:45.347]  There's some sort of pyrotechnic material.
[00:40:46.047 --> 00:40:49.049]  That also is supported by the World Trade Center dust laboratory work.
[00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:51.470]  That's also supported by the molten metal
[00:40:52.068 --> 00:40:54.409]  And they had the evidence of sulfidation of the steel.
[00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.392]  All of this supports pyrotechnic or thermitic materials being present at the World Trade Center.
[00:41:00.592 --> 00:41:01.473]  Let's talk about that.
[00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:21.343]  Yeah, if we talk about how could that happen, we look into what kinds of thermitic material we could possibly have seen and could have been placed in the World Trade Center buildings, possibly even without being noticed, at least in the terms in the case of the towers that wasn't occupied by so many
[00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:23.947]  Interesting organizations.
[00:41:24.047 --> 00:41:47.968]  But if we look into that, when we find these energetic nanocomposites, which are thermite materials, very powerful on a nano level, not only is the power from the amount of energy release, but also from the rate of energy release, because a nanothermite is composed of nanoaluminum and oxidizers at a nano level.
[00:41:48.581 --> 00:41:52.323]  Where the surface area is very large with respect to the volume.
[00:41:52.363 --> 00:41:54.805]  So the reactive area is very large.
[00:41:55.485 --> 00:41:58.387]  And that's why they're so explosive and powerful.
[00:41:59.348 --> 00:42:02.250]  And also... And now I think you're... Let's clarify that.
[00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:07.613]  The explosive and the power you're talking about is relative to the twin towers.
[00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:16.979]  So do you believe that in World Trade Center 7 that we're talking about the non-nano explosive thermite?
[00:42:17.629 --> 00:42:18.390]  Not necessarily.
[00:42:18.691 --> 00:42:29.988]  We'd have to have more evidence, but I would suggest that if a nanothermite is placed in the floors of a failure of the towers, then why wouldn't it, of course, also be placed
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:38.307]  Okay, gentlemen, we've got to pause there for a break, but we're going to continue for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and Infowars.com stream listeners during this break.
[00:42:38.347 --> 00:42:41.270]  So, for everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:45.253]  I want to hold you both five minutes over to the next hour as well, because this is so important.
[00:42:45.273 --> 00:42:46.755]  I hope everybody's listening.
[00:42:47.135 --> 00:42:48.717]  They blew up all three buildings.
[00:42:48.797 --> 00:42:50.298]  It's a documented fact.
[00:42:50.798 --> 00:42:52.360]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:42:56.331 --> 00:43:04.999]  I'm going to go back to you both, because this will be on the web, it's on the web live now, but later put up on YouTube and the rest of it and for PrisonPlanet.tv folks as an archive as well.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:13.767]  We'll get back into the science of all this in three minutes, but right now, again, how this is affecting you both individually, because that's important with everybody else in the country.
[00:43:14.087 --> 00:43:18.812]  How would you like to see this, Richard Gage, Kevin Ryan, Kevin First,
[00:43:19.312 --> 00:43:28.196]  Proceed when all of the hypotheses of Jones, Professor Jones and others, continue to be proven while your hypotheses continue to be proven.
[00:43:28.456 --> 00:43:35.920]  The original Underwriters Report says something's rotten here, you know, fires can't do this in the towers.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.161]  I mean, any real study shows they blew it up.
[00:43:39.461 --> 00:43:40.762]  Who they are comes later.
[00:43:41.382 --> 00:43:47.545]  But you've got to ask yourself now that you're getting so close to totally proving it open and shut, what do you do with that data?
[00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:58.327]  Well, we publish it is one thing we're trying to do, and we're trying to convince scientists in more of a mainstream community, right?
[00:43:58.407 --> 00:44:02.230]  We're trying to get articles published in mainstream journals, so that's one step.
[00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:16.860]  And then, when we've got enough people in professional sorts of areas who can't deny that this is the truth of the matter, then we need to have some sort of a, I guess,
[00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.251]  Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
[00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:21.671]  People are talking about that lately.
[00:44:21.711 --> 00:44:27.232]  I don't know how much forgiveness there is available in our arts anymore.
[00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:30.493]  Well, how do you forgive them if they won't admit it?
[00:44:30.933 --> 00:44:34.735]  Yeah, well, the people who committed these crimes are not going to admit it.
[00:44:34.915 --> 00:44:38.175]  Oh, hell, they're going to set a nuke off and say some clown in a cave did it.
[00:44:38.195 --> 00:44:38.976]  They're not going to stop.
[00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:50.175]  But I think just as you said, Alex, there's a lot of good people in the government, so we're not really talking about the government did it so much as we're talking about... A criminal element, a criminal section, slash private corporations, yeah.
[00:44:50.615 --> 00:44:53.097]  Right, we're talking about the people who did it... A rogue!
[00:44:53.697 --> 00:44:53.918]  Yeah.
[00:44:54.678 --> 00:45:09.868]  Are also people who control elements within our government, and so I think we need to root those people out, but at some point we're also going to have to forgive the many people who didn't speak up early enough, possibly even like underwriters' laboratories.
[00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:15.473]  If I can... Well, the debunkers are now basically coming out in Republican memos.
[00:45:15.493 --> 00:45:18.156]  I can hear you, but I cannot hear Alex.
[00:45:18.796 --> 00:45:20.658]  Oh, I don't know why the network's not sending you that.
[00:45:20.678 --> 00:45:23.000]  Well, Richard, we're going to be live in just a moment, okay?
[00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:24.901]  We'll be... Yeah, I can hear you.
[00:45:25.242 --> 00:45:25.522]  Okay.
[00:45:25.922 --> 00:45:28.665]  We'll be right back in just a moment with the full broadcast.
[00:45:28.685 --> 00:45:35.651]  Let's continue with that discussion for everybody else and elaborate on where we're going with this and then more of the science.
[00:45:35.891 --> 00:45:37.933]  Can you guys both stay with me five minutes to the next hour?
[00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:39.563]  Sure, sir.
[00:45:39.643 --> 00:45:40.564]  Okay, another ten minutes.
[00:45:41.265 --> 00:45:41.566]  Here we go.
[00:46:35.424 --> 00:46:41.967]  The men we've got on the air with us, engineer, architect, are leaders for liberty and freedom.
[00:46:41.987 --> 00:46:42.708]  They have the courage.
[00:46:42.728 --> 00:46:46.710]  They've lost jobs, lost wives over this.
[00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.852]  And they're going straight on at the murders of 3,000 people.
[00:46:51.913 --> 00:46:56.155]  They used that for a war that's taken over a million lives of Iraqis and Afghans.
[00:46:58.496 --> 00:47:00.757]  It's taken the lives of more than 5,000 U.S.
[00:47:01.057 --> 00:47:01.798]  troops admittedly.
[00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:06.106]  Dennis Kucinich says the number is more like 20,000.
[00:47:08.247 --> 00:47:15.171]  We were just talking during the behind-the-scenes of PrisonPlanet.tv viewers about where all this goes, and we were talking about the black ops.
[00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:17.612]  Kevin Ryan wanted to make the point, and I agree with him, it's not the government.
[00:47:17.652 --> 00:47:20.533]  It's criminal elements, rogue groups, but they're in high positions.
[00:47:20.553 --> 00:47:21.414]  That's what a coup is.
[00:47:21.794 --> 00:47:25.516]  A small group getting key positions, and then taking over the rest of the government.
[00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:30.849]  How do you see this unfolding, Richard Gage, Kevin Ryan?
[00:47:30.869 --> 00:47:40.259]  I mean, now that we've got the proof, their own internal reports, Underwriter Laboratories reports that were suppressed, showing that these buildings were blown sky high.
[00:47:45.644 --> 00:47:46.225]  Where does it go?
[00:47:48.687 --> 00:47:48.987]  Richard?
[00:47:49.748 --> 00:47:51.230]  Well, I suppose...
[00:47:51.952 --> 00:47:57.836]  I suppose the only place that it can go is... We won't go anywhere if the American people don't wake up.
[00:47:58.897 --> 00:48:19.192]  It won't go anywhere if we don't get the support from your listeners to email the AE911Truth.org link to every architect and engineer that they can find, because this is the group of people right now in the 9-11 Truth movement that have the necessary credibility to turn the heads in Congress, and if we don't,
[00:48:19.818 --> 00:48:33.770]  If we don't activate them and get to 1,000 architects and engineers by 9-11-2008, we may not be in time to wake enough people up before the next false flag operation.
[00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.290]  I agree.
[00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.591]  This is life and death, folks.
[00:48:35.751 --> 00:48:36.532]  This is life and death.
[00:48:36.552 --> 00:48:37.833]  McCain says another attack.
[00:48:38.153 --> 00:48:40.776]  They're going to have basically martial law and a national draft.
[00:48:41.316 --> 00:48:47.681]  Have you seen all the Republican memos and public statements about how great terror attacks are in the letter?
[00:48:48.682 --> 00:48:55.006]  From one of the top CFR guys, Gary Hart, to the Iranians saying, we stage events, you better do what we say.
[00:48:55.386 --> 00:48:58.568]  And then we talked to him and he said, yeah, I'm saying the government will stage events.
[00:48:58.948 --> 00:49:04.152]  I had Ray McGovern on yesterday saying, flat out, 9-11, inside job, you know, flat out, they'll stage more.
[00:49:04.212 --> 00:49:05.472]  He's not mincing words.
[00:49:06.013 --> 00:49:10.255]  I mean, Bill Christensen was a CIA section chief in Europe.
[00:49:10.515 --> 00:49:11.896]  He says total inside job.
[00:49:11.936 --> 00:49:13.517]  I mean, it's an inside job!
[00:49:13.877 --> 00:49:15.378]  Folks, do you realize what that means?
[00:49:15.518 --> 00:49:17.199]  Murderers are in control!
[00:49:17.279 --> 00:49:17.880]  Richard Gage.
[00:49:20.137 --> 00:49:31.627]  Well, the architects and engineers have a particular focus, and that is to bring the technical truth to the American people, and we cannot do it without help.
[00:49:32.448 --> 00:49:36.552]  I can speak to about 10,000 people a year.
[00:49:36.872 --> 00:49:37.793]  That is peanuts.
[00:49:38.293 --> 00:49:41.456]  What we need to do is reach millions, and we've got to have
[00:49:41.949 --> 00:49:45.011]  Your viewers sending this link to everybody they know.
[00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:51.314]  Yeah, they've got to send the videos of you that are online, the ones that have linked Kevin to every architect and engineer, not just the website.
[00:49:51.734 --> 00:49:53.255]  They need to send TerrorStorm.
[00:49:53.615 --> 00:49:58.137]  They need to get the information, and not just the architect and engineers, police, military.
[00:49:58.477 --> 00:49:59.678]  This is life and death.
[00:50:01.259 --> 00:50:01.859]  It sure is.
[00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:04.185]  And Kevin's doing his role too.
[00:50:04.285 --> 00:50:16.539]  He's doing some incredible research that exposes the nanothermic stuff and who's even responsible behind some of these characters.
[00:50:16.659 --> 00:50:18.281]  I want to do 5 more minutes on that.
[00:50:19.122 --> 00:50:19.702]  60 second break.
[00:50:20.323 --> 00:50:21.464]  Back in 70 seconds total.
[00:50:21.764 --> 00:50:22.485]  I want to come back.
[00:50:23.382 --> 00:50:30.090]  And have Kevin Ryan spend a few more minutes specifically tracking the nanoparticulates back to Surprise Surprise.
[00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.773]  The top experts in it are the ones running the investigation.
[00:50:37.419 --> 00:50:38.961]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:51:47.853 --> 00:51:49.774]  Waging war on corruption!
[00:51:50.235 --> 00:51:52.996]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[00:51:59.616 --> 00:52:00.396]  The debate's over.
[00:52:00.416 --> 00:52:02.877]  9-11 is a inside job.
[00:52:04.137 --> 00:52:04.697]  Bottom line.
[00:52:06.258 --> 00:52:17.281]  I discovered many years ago that it was declassified, admitted, not debated, that criminal elements of our government at the highest levels have staged hundreds of terror attacks in foreign countries to blame it on their enemies.
[00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:19.321]  As a pretext of war.
[00:52:20.862 --> 00:52:28.104]  And so, when I saw the government bomb the Oklahoma City building, when I saw them cook the bomb, train the drivers, provocateur the first World Trade Center attack,
[00:52:29.923 --> 00:52:34.727]  When I saw them getting us hyped up before 9-11, I went on air and I said, look out, they're going to hit the towers, and they did.
[00:52:35.267 --> 00:52:35.847]  In a big way.
[00:52:36.448 --> 00:52:42.252]  Kevin Ryan, member of Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, the founder, also Richard Gage with us.
[00:52:42.672 --> 00:52:58.324]  Kevin, get back more into tracing back thermate, explosive accelerants, thermate, this explosive type of thermite, getting down into nano-sized particulates, the residue found in multiple samples there, and then you look at who's doing the investigation, who's doing the cover-up,
[00:52:58.964 --> 00:52:59.965]  Okay, great.
[00:52:59.985 --> 00:53:11.649]  Yeah, the thermite that I'm most interested in is sprayable.
[00:53:11.949 --> 00:53:21.013]  It's a material that was developed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and they clearly make it stated that they can spray this on surfaces.
[00:53:21.833 --> 00:53:27.135]  And so that relates to the question of how the floors in the World Trade Center
[00:53:27.828 --> 00:53:35.435]  Um, that were impacted and had fires in them just happened to match up exactly with the floors of fireproofing upgrade in 1999 and so forth.
[00:53:35.935 --> 00:53:44.583]  Well, in 1999, these scientists at Lawrence Livermore National National Lab performed experiments on these energetic nanocomposites at NIST.
[00:53:45.563 --> 00:53:50.668]  So then, you know, that leads you to the question of how NIST has responded to questions about thermite.
[00:53:50.708 --> 00:53:53.270]  They've actually acted like they never heard of it before.
[00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:55.352]  You know, we never tested for it.
[00:53:55.846 --> 00:53:58.108]  We just never imagined that was a possibility.
[00:53:59.109 --> 00:54:04.834]  But, of course, that's absurd when you look at Forman Williams, their leading engineer on their advisory committee and so forth.
[00:54:05.274 --> 00:54:18.565]  But if you look at their top directors as well, there was Arden Beeman, who was nominated by George W. Bush in October of 2001, a month after the events, and became the director of NIST shortly thereafter.
[00:54:18.585 --> 00:54:19.746]  It was an interesting choice.
[00:54:20.359 --> 00:54:30.483]  He was a former Deputy Secretary of Defense and a former Director of DARPA's Office of Material Science, and a former executive at TRW.
[00:54:30.563 --> 00:54:38.727]  TRW is a military contractor that is involved in creating gellent materials for energetic nanocomposites.
[00:54:39.447 --> 00:54:42.848]  He's also connected to very interesting organizations like Battelle.
[00:54:42.868 --> 00:54:48.771]  You've probably heard of Battelle, but they're an organization that manages the five national
[00:54:49.298 --> 00:54:49.558]  Thank you!
[00:55:19.594 --> 00:55:27.016]  And actually wrote 10 papers with the world's leading expert on energetic nanocomposites.
[00:55:27.056 --> 00:55:28.897]  The connection is too clear.
[00:55:29.357 --> 00:55:31.637]  I don't mean to make myself clear.
[00:55:31.657 --> 00:55:38.919]  I don't mean to come out and accuse these people today, but I'm just saying that these connections are too clear and too coincidental.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:44.021]  If you're nominating people who just happen to have all this experience,
[00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:48.618]  In what is ultimately being found to be a culprit in the event.
[00:55:48.638 --> 00:56:05.731]  You have an incredibly specific and rare science with probably only a few hundred people in the world or less that are experts and you don't just have some of the experts, you have the fathers of these weapons systems who are minions of Bush, pro-war hawks,
[00:56:06.451 --> 00:56:10.332]  Magically running the investigation and then laughing at you saying thermite what?
[00:56:10.613 --> 00:56:11.973]  Thermite is an accelerant.
[00:56:11.993 --> 00:56:13.314]  Thermite to burn down buildings.
[00:56:13.614 --> 00:56:18.355]  Thermate, you know, acting like you're a kook and it turns out they're the masters of it.
[00:56:18.815 --> 00:56:19.796]  Right, absolutely.
[00:56:19.836 --> 00:56:21.116]  I mean that's absurd, right?
[00:56:21.657 --> 00:56:23.297]  And if you look at all the other... Stop, stop.
[00:56:23.317 --> 00:56:23.577]  You know what?
[00:56:23.597 --> 00:56:24.257]  This is too important.
[00:56:24.277 --> 00:56:27.499]  I got another guest, Kevin Booth, coming up but I want to back him up ten minutes.
[00:56:27.519 --> 00:56:28.739]  Can you guys do ten more minutes?
[00:56:29.299 --> 00:56:30.019]  Sure.
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:30.800]  This is too important.
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.660]  I want to come back and finish up with this.
[00:56:33.381 --> 00:56:33.941]  You have
[00:56:35.816 --> 00:56:38.437]  The world experts in thermite.
[00:56:38.497 --> 00:56:41.079]  Thermate to burn down buildings to cut pillars.
[00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.401]  You have them doing secret tests with NIST.
[00:56:46.001 --> 00:56:47.082]  Now it all comes out.
[00:56:47.522 --> 00:56:51.684]  This is before the attacks and then it's them involved in the cover-up.
[00:56:52.324 --> 00:56:54.806]  I mean it doesn't get any worse than this ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:55.466 --> 00:57:02.250]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release.
[00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:03.010]  This is too important.
[00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:04.831]  I want to come back and finish up with this.
[00:57:05.558 --> 00:57:10.640]  You have the world experts in thermite.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.281]  Thermate to burn down buildings to cut pillars.
[00:57:14.621 --> 00:57:17.603]  You have them doing secret tests with NIST.
[00:57:18.203 --> 00:57:19.283]  Now it all comes out.
[00:57:19.723 --> 00:57:23.825]  This is before the attacks and then it's them involved in the cover-up.
[00:57:24.523 --> 00:57:27.025]  I mean, it doesn't get any worse than this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:27.585 --> 00:57:40.312]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:57:40.733 --> 00:57:44.555]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:57:44.915 --> 00:57:51.419]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.982]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:57:55.202 --> 00:58:02.707]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:58:27.742 --> 00:58:36.467]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:58:36.647 --> 00:58:41.430]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:52.937]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:58:53.337 --> 00:58:58.878]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:58:59.099 --> 00:59:05.180]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.000]  What about you?

[01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:16.362]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[01:00:31.838 --> 01:00:36.040]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.501]  You want answers?
[01:00:38.261 --> 01:00:39.121]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:39.822 --> 01:00:43.764]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:44.004 --> 01:00:48.126]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:49.226 --> 01:00:59.011]  Alright, final segment with Engineer Kevin Ryan, who worked at Underwriting Laboratories, discovered they had
[01:01:00.743 --> 01:01:05.828]  ...reports they were suppressing about the fact that those fires wouldn't have brought down the towers, much less Building 7.
[01:01:05.868 --> 01:01:09.091]  He got fired over that, over speaking out.
[01:01:10.472 --> 01:01:14.496]  And, of course, we have Richard Gage, who is an architect, builds large buildings.
[01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:16.238]  He looked at the evidence, couldn't believe it.
[01:01:16.258 --> 01:01:18.800]  He's got over 400 architects and engineers now part of his group.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.745]  Before we go any further, men, both give out websites you think are important for people to visit.
[01:01:26.843 --> 01:01:30.904]  Well, you could start with ae911truth.org.
[01:01:31.224 --> 01:01:35.685]  That's www.ae911truth.org.
[01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:39.786]  And then Kevin's got a great website at Scholars.
[01:01:40.987 --> 01:01:44.728]  Yeah, we've got a Scholars website, stj911.com.
[01:01:44.748 --> 01:01:49.209]  We've got the Journal of 9-11 Studies.com, Journal of 9-1-1 Studies.com.
[01:01:49.889 --> 01:01:52.810]  I've contributed to a book that's coming out again here shortly.
[01:01:53.737 --> 01:02:03.782]  The Hidden History of 9-1-1, the editor is Paul Zaremka, where I talk about some of the science involved in some of the debunking that went on.
[01:02:05.603 --> 01:02:06.443]  What other websites?
[01:02:08.964 --> 01:02:09.725]  I think that should do it.
[01:02:12.246 --> 01:02:18.029]  Of course, Jim Hoffman's website is excellent as well, WTC7.net.
[01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.929]  Absolutely.
[01:02:19.129 --> 01:02:19.829]  Great website.
[01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:22.891]  Now, continue.
[01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:32.470]  Kevin Ryan, you were getting into another one of these engineers involved in the NIST chicanery and his connections.
[01:02:34.071 --> 01:02:41.154]  Well, we went through Forman Williams, the lead engineer in the advisory committee, went through the directors Beeman and Sumerjian.
[01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:47.356]  We talked about SEIC, which is the Science Application International Corporation.
[01:02:48.136 --> 01:02:50.237]  And they have connections to Thermite and they were the
[01:02:52.847 --> 01:02:56.568]  The largest contingent on the NIST investigation outside of the government employees.
[01:02:57.188 --> 01:03:04.449]  They have a company called Applied Ordnance Technology that does research on energetic nanocomposites.
[01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:17.912]  And they also were involved in contracts coordinated by a company, not a company, but a military organization called the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indian Head in 1999 to 2000.
[01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:21.957]  They are a creator.
[01:03:21.977 --> 01:03:26.759]  They're actually a manufacturer of the materials needed for energetic nanocomposites.
[01:03:27.399 --> 01:03:30.600]  So, you know, there's a lot of connections here.
[01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:35.722]  I think you can go to the 9-11 Commission and you see some really interesting connections.
[01:03:35.762 --> 01:03:47.365]  You see John Layman, who was a 9-11 Commissioner, former Secretary of the Navy, and he just decided to buy a company called Special Devices in 1998 and then divest in 2001.
[01:03:51.149 --> 01:03:54.332]  This is a company that makes explosives for spacecraft.
[01:03:55.293 --> 01:03:56.975]  Very interesting types of explosives.
[01:03:57.576 --> 01:04:05.224]  So, one thing I would say is that energetic nanocomposites and thermite materials are only part of the story at the World Trade Center.
[01:04:05.244 --> 01:04:06.725]  There clearly were other explosives.
[01:04:06.806 --> 01:04:10.890]  Are those special explosive bolts for emergency exits on spacecraft?
[01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.470]  Right.
[01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:13.352]  Separation joint materials.
[01:04:14.324 --> 01:04:14.925]  We're good to go.
[01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:40.698]  Um, but I think the space connections are... That's right, they're always saying there has to be wiring in the building for explosives.
[01:04:41.098 --> 01:04:41.298]  Right.
[01:04:41.438 --> 01:04:44.541]  I mean, just unbelievable little creatures, but they're the fathers of yellow journalism.
[01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:45.382]  They know what they're doing.
[01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:46.643]  Despicable people.
[01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:47.684]  Now, let's go back here.
[01:04:48.524 --> 01:04:51.687]  You got into something that I think should be a major headline.
[01:04:52.468 --> 01:04:59.354]  I mean, you just brought up one of these guys with a company that makes the, you know, high-tech thermate nanomaterials.
[01:05:00.456 --> 01:05:08.939]  But earlier, you were talking about the installation by a company connected to all of this of, quote, new fireproofing in 99.
[01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:10.679]  Let's go back to that.
[01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:27.405]  Yeah, I've got a paper that I wrote called Another Amazing Coincidence at the World Trade Center, and it shows how the floors that were upgraded for fireproofing in the towers matched almost exactly with the floors where the planes impacted.
[01:05:28.118 --> 01:05:32.120]  And the fires, which shouldn't have been there for so long, actually occurred.
[01:05:33.401 --> 01:05:42.025]  And so, then we go into looking at the NIST report that talks about this, and there were some reports mentioned that aren't available to the public.
[01:05:42.145 --> 01:05:46.547]  One was made by a company called Burrow Appled, an engineering consultant from England.
[01:05:47.028 --> 01:05:56.732]  They did an investigation of these fireproofing upgrades, and as they were going on, as they were starting, and they were suggesting the use of, quote, alternative materials.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.023]  Let's just speculate on the possibilities for how this could happen.
[01:06:02.043 --> 01:06:10.391]  You know, thermitic materials applied underneath fireproofing would work just as well as if they were applied, you know, without fireproofing.
[01:06:10.451 --> 01:06:14.434]  And let's not forget, this building had the CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence.
[01:06:14.834 --> 01:06:16.156]  It was all government.
[01:06:16.196 --> 01:06:22.301]  This was the most spooked out building anywhere because you had them all together in one building.
[01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:24.630]  Yeah, on World Trade Center 7.
[01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:42.875]  So, if they were using alternative materials for fireproofing, they might use something, for example, intumescent paint is something that would be used for fireproofing, but if somebody was applying it and they didn't know what it really was... I was about to say, this sounds perfect, where you give them the material, you give them the diagrams on how to apply it, they don't even know what they're doing!
[01:06:42.995 --> 01:06:44.035]  Right, they wouldn't even know.
[01:06:44.175 --> 01:06:49.937]  And the materials are resistant to non-intentional ignition.
[01:06:50.435 --> 01:06:51.155]  How would they detonate them?
[01:07:11.344 --> 01:07:11.865]  I think?
[01:07:26.079 --> 01:07:31.680]  And one other thing... Of course this would be tied into Space Command and that whole directorate that runs the whole Pentagon.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.280]  Of course they're using their high-tech brains for this.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.921]  I mean, this is just classic behavior by these people.
[01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:53.904]  Well, you might think it's unusual or strange, but if you go back to when I read David Gray Griffin's first book, The New Pearl Harbor, in 2004, the only thing unusual or surprising about that book to me was his suggestion that the motive was for space
[01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:57.305]  Weaponization.
[01:07:57.546 --> 01:07:58.346]  Weaponization, yeah.
[01:07:58.386 --> 01:07:59.767]  For weaponization of space.
[01:07:59.807 --> 01:08:07.250]  So, then you look through these people who are involved in the companies that have access to all these things and find a lot of connections to space.
[01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:14.294]  You also find a lot of connections to space exploration and the debunkers and the diverters.
[01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:21.557]  I mean, if you think about it, a lot of people who either work for NASA or they're space exploration buffs.
[01:08:21.637 --> 01:08:23.498]  And again, I'm not trying to accuse anybody.
[01:08:23.878 --> 01:08:24.939]  It's just pretty odd.
[01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.600]  Yeah, we never thought of that, that's why we didn't test for it, so oh well.
[01:08:49.556 --> 01:09:02.522]  Kevin, regarding the impact, the coincidence of the fire-proofing upgrades at the impact zones of each tower, I think what you're saying is, we have the fire-proofing upgrades at floor 95.
[01:09:02.802 --> 01:09:12.226]  The exact floors that catch on fire, and then NIST has to admit, right before it collapses, the fires are almost out, then suddenly all over the building, fires blasting out of windows.
[01:09:13.186 --> 01:09:13.807]  Yeah, it sure seems to be.
[01:09:13.827 --> 01:09:16.409]  My question is that what happens then to the concrete floor slabs
[01:09:31.912 --> 01:09:47.183]  Below those levels, because I can understand that there was some spray on high-tech nanothermites in the areas of these impact zones, but what we have is the systematic destruction, the impact zone right down... These guys love cocktails from past operations.
[01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:54.148]  They may have had two or three overlays, and I think the evidence is a novice, shows multiple types of explosives being used.
[01:09:54.168 --> 01:09:54.648]  Kevin, right?
[01:09:55.109 --> 01:09:56.349]  Absolutely, I agree with you.
[01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:58.131]  I think we're both on the same page.
[01:09:58.191 --> 01:09:59.552]  I think that's where Richard is going.
[01:10:00.172 --> 01:10:12.803]  Richard also talked about the upgrades of the elevator shafts by the Ace Elevator Company, where again we see the unusual case of all the elevator mechanics disappearing.
[01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:17.179]  After the event when they normally would be the ones to stay and save people.
[01:10:17.739 --> 01:10:23.024]  And again, we're not trying to accuse these people of anything, but it is unusual how these things all add up.
[01:10:23.304 --> 01:10:24.044]  Yeah, let me stop you.
[01:10:24.064 --> 01:10:24.765]  We're out of time.
[01:10:24.805 --> 01:10:28.788]  I've got to have you up the next few weeks for a two, three hour presentation, both of you.
[01:10:28.828 --> 01:10:30.890]  This is even worse than what I thought.
[01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:36.334]  I mean, I've been reading all your papers and looking at the documents, but hearing it all put together, Kevin Ryan, Richard Gage, you blow me away.
[01:10:36.374 --> 01:10:38.376]  In closing, something else happened.
[01:10:39.065 --> 01:10:47.689]  When you guys really got hot on the trail about two years ago, and when Jones brought out his evidence, suddenly I saw him get attacked by every quarter by the quote, crazies.
[01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:52.931]  And people who hadn't been crazy, go crazy, and they all attacked him and Thermate and Thermite.
[01:10:53.391 --> 01:10:58.213]  And I see that as another key indicator and how they went after his job and the rest of it.
[01:10:58.613 --> 01:11:02.274]  That's another example of just, they came out of the woodwork.
[01:11:02.554 --> 01:11:08.617]  When he said Thermate, it was like the debunkers just went on overdrive and came out from every angle.
[01:11:09.017 --> 01:11:10.640]  I mean, is that not another indicator here?
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:13.665]  Sure.
[01:11:13.986 --> 01:11:14.827]  Sure seems to be.
[01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:20.096]  Yeah, I would say it is, and I think we're in for an exciting summer because another anniversary's coming up.
[01:11:20.834 --> 01:11:24.537]  And I hear that the BBC have another pot shot to take.
[01:11:24.917 --> 01:11:25.898]  Well, they're very deceptive.
[01:11:25.938 --> 01:11:30.621]  This guy, Smith guy, that's doing them, wouldn't let me talk about Northwoods, wouldn't let me talk about massing U.S.
[01:11:30.641 --> 01:11:33.863]  troops in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the areas I focus on.
[01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:42.709]  And they then told Dylan Avery that we didn't have footage of Barry Jennings, the Deputy Emergency Manager, saying that there were bodies and bombs and stuff.
[01:11:42.749 --> 01:11:43.990]  And then we had the video.
[01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:44.750]  We released that.
[01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:47.012]  He begged us not to, but then he went and talked to them.
[01:11:47.712 --> 01:11:51.757]  And so, just very disingenuous, this production.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.381]  Well, I'm looking forward to seeing it.
[01:11:56.401 --> 01:12:20.233]  They interviewed Stephen Jones and myself, and I got a call from Mike Rudin of the BBC, who's more involved in this than Guy Smith, who was involved in the last hit piece, and he told me that the scenes that he had lined up to play, and so it looks like he's gonna play the stuff that we need him to play, so I'm actually very hopeful this time.
[01:12:21.074 --> 01:12:22.815]  Okay, gentlemen, we'll talk to you very soon.
[01:12:22.855 --> 01:12:23.535]  Incredible work.
[01:12:24.679 --> 01:12:25.079]  Thank you.
[01:12:27.241 --> 01:12:28.922]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:12:29.203 --> 01:12:32.645]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:12:32.825 --> 01:12:34.667]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:12:35.147 --> 01:12:38.009]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:43.794]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:12:44.054 --> 01:12:47.977]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:53.218]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:12:53.478 --> 01:12:56.259]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:13:25.346 --> 01:13:26.747]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:30.228]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[01:13:30.588 --> 01:13:32.649]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.930]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:42.633]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized a contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.
[01:13:43.073 --> 01:13:45.274]  Online from my desk with Webex.
[01:13:45.695 --> 01:13:48.776]  Webex lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[01:13:48.997 --> 01:13:53.619]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[01:13:53.779 --> 01:13:57.481]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[01:13:57.702 --> 01:13:59.222]  Travel less, meet online.
[01:13:59.322 --> 01:14:01.864]  Go to Webex.com and try Webex.
[01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:04.465]  There might still be time to turn this around.
[01:14:04.485 --> 01:14:06.547]  It's gonna hurt everybody.
[01:14:07.819 --> 01:14:09.560]  Tyranny is bad for business.
[01:14:10.021 --> 01:14:10.861]  Bad for life.
[01:14:15.765 --> 01:14:17.005]  It's even bad for the tyrants.
[01:14:17.045 --> 01:14:18.266]  They then get assassinated.
[01:14:18.286 --> 01:14:21.168]  Their own police state apparatus always overthrows them.
[01:14:25.671 --> 01:14:27.433]  But this happens in history.
[01:14:27.473 --> 01:14:28.233]  This is the norm.
[01:14:30.495 --> 01:14:33.377]  And good people can't admit to themselves the great evil they're witnessing.
[01:14:35.834 --> 01:14:38.855]  They have to wait until it fully takes over their life and their society.
[01:14:40.336 --> 01:14:42.337]  There's a lot of reasons I got Kevin Booth on today.
[01:14:42.397 --> 01:14:44.138]  The drug war is a war against the people.
[01:14:44.178 --> 01:14:45.818]  The government ships the majority of the drugs in.
[01:14:45.858 --> 01:14:46.839]  That's proven.
[01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:49.480]  His film is really sending shockwaves across the country.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:53.002]  We have it at Infowars.com for cheaper than you'll find it anywhere else.
[01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:55.002]  I hope you'll get American Drug War.
[01:14:55.082 --> 01:14:59.664]  It's a two-hour film with more than three hours of extras on one DVD.
[01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:00.425]  Just amazing.
[01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:03.291]  And it's done in a very balanced way.
[01:15:03.731 --> 01:15:10.976]  It attacks a lot of angles, not just the government drug dealing, but how prescription drugs and alcohol kill thousands of times what other drugs do, and how it's all a big scam.
[01:15:11.776 --> 01:15:16.579]  We'll go over that with Kevin someday, but Kevin was good friends with Bill Hicks, his original producer.
[01:15:16.599 --> 01:15:18.940]  He's got the best-selling book on Bill Hicks.
[01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:23.643]  It's finally in a few newspapers, so Kevin can talk some about it.
[01:15:24.624 --> 01:15:29.827]  Russell Crowe, one of my favorite actors, is going to be making a movie about Bill Hicks, playing Bill Hicks.
[01:15:30.427 --> 01:15:31.870]  In the next few years it should be out.
[01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:34.955]  And also George Carlin, kind of remembering him.
[01:15:34.975 --> 01:15:38.001]  All those other serious stuff's happening.
[01:15:38.121 --> 01:15:40.325]  Israel's prodding the US to attack Iran.
[01:15:40.345 --> 01:15:41.487]  That's CBS News.
[01:15:42.449 --> 01:15:42.749]  I agree, I agree.
[01:16:09.366 --> 01:16:12.828]  It's spinning faster and faster, definitely.
[01:16:12.988 --> 01:16:16.870]  We're going to talk about your film, and I'm going to have you back up in the next few weeks to take calls.
[01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:17.730]  People want to hear from you.
[01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:22.532]  But right now, just because it's interesting, we might as well fiddle while Rome burns.
[01:16:25.253 --> 01:16:27.895]  But Bill Hicks was an anti-establishment icon.
[01:16:30.876 --> 01:16:32.857]  How much can you tell us about the Russell Crowe stuff?
[01:16:32.877 --> 01:16:35.258]  You've told me a lot, but I don't want to say anything in case it's off record.
[01:16:35.754 --> 01:16:38.056]  Well, it's still pretty much early in the development.
[01:16:38.096 --> 01:16:48.085]  I believe Russell Crowe decided that he wanted to, he just got it in his head that he wanted to be Bill Hicks on stage.
[01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:57.674]  And he started, I guess, having fantasies about, you know, portraying Bill Hicks in a small club and being like the angry guy on stage and the whole thing.
[01:16:57.694 --> 01:16:59.476]  And they've been through a lot of different
[01:17:00.271 --> 01:17:02.453]  Uh, generations of how this film would go.
[01:17:02.473 --> 01:17:12.060]  They first started thinking it would be like this big long performance piece, and then they realized the more they worked on it, that it had to become more like just a normal film.
[01:17:13.281 --> 01:17:18.145]  I believe they've owned the rights, the life rights for a while to do this, so they've been tinkering with this for a while.
[01:17:18.825 --> 01:17:22.928]  So it's really still in its early stages, but it does look like it's going to happen.
[01:17:24.187 --> 01:17:28.610]  You know, it looks like it's probably going to happen with somebody like Russell Crowe behind it and all that.
[01:17:28.670 --> 01:17:32.493]  Boy, you are holding your cards close to the vest, Kevin.
[01:17:32.953 --> 01:17:38.837]  I mean, it's been in a few publications that Russell Crowe's making it, and what, we're looking for March of 2009?
[01:17:39.177 --> 01:17:41.979]  Yeah, but I mean, right now a script doesn't even exist.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.941]  Yeah, so they keep getting behind on it.
[01:17:44.443 --> 01:18:01.247]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the guy, I mean, the guy was just here at my house the other day working on the script, so, I mean, you know, I know that there's not even a script yet to read, so... Well, that's the thing, is it's such a love affair for Russell Crowe that he wants to make it perfect, and sometimes if you try that with something, it never happens.
[01:18:02.207 --> 01:18:06.088]  Yeah, so, it's, um, you know, it'll be interesting.
[01:18:06.108 --> 01:18:11.709]  I do know once they, you know, they get this synopsis up and running, this guy by the name of Mark Stauffer, who,
[01:18:12.702 --> 01:18:14.182]  I believe his old buddies with Russell.
[01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:17.483]  In fact, when you talk to him on the phone, you think you're talking to Russell.
[01:18:17.684 --> 01:18:21.285]  Yeah, he's one of the ranch guys from out there in Australia and New Zealand.
[01:18:21.325 --> 01:18:25.586]  Yeah, he's from New Zealand, and he looks like Russell and sounds like Russell.
[01:18:25.606 --> 01:18:31.128]  I've known him for a long time, and so he's just kind of one of, I guess, Russell's homies, you would say.
[01:18:31.148 --> 01:18:33.248]  A doppelganger.
[01:18:33.828 --> 01:18:34.629]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:35.629]  He's been out here in L.A.
[01:18:35.649 --> 01:18:36.469]  for about four years.
[01:18:36.569 --> 01:18:38.390]  I think he wrote one other script for Russell.
[01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:42.351]  Right now, Russell is finishing this movie called Nottingham, I think.
[01:18:43.228 --> 01:18:47.811]  Big mega blockbuster and then after he's done with that he's going to put his full-time attention on this.
[01:18:48.692 --> 01:18:53.715]  And I believe it's with a smaller company called Weed Road or something like that.
[01:18:54.256 --> 01:18:56.718]  It's a production company that has something to do with a beautiful mind.
[01:18:58.159 --> 01:19:02.221]  Well, Kevin, this is super exciting and I'm just glad that you're involved in it in a small way.
[01:19:02.762 --> 01:19:11.008]  And I will sit here and enjoy watching this from afar as you sit there high atop your Hollywood mountain in Lawrence Fishburne's former house in the Matrix.
[01:19:12.995 --> 01:19:13.615]  That's funny.
[01:19:14.936 --> 01:19:17.197]  I have a funny Lawrence Fishburne story.
[01:19:17.517 --> 01:19:18.237]  Let's tell that!
[01:19:18.257 --> 01:19:19.597]  You've told me that about the dog part.
[01:19:20.318 --> 01:19:23.679]  We gotta have a little light stuff after the government blew up the buildings here, folks.
[01:19:24.439 --> 01:19:25.560]  I gotta have a little light stuff.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:28.881]  Plus, my dad, the doctor, just dropped by and looked at my leg.
[01:19:28.901 --> 01:19:32.682]  I have some type of flesh-eating bacteria eating the bone.
[01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:34.383]  I have to go to the doctor right after the show.
[01:19:34.923 --> 01:19:36.544]  Yeah, the Supreme Court bit me, folks.
[01:19:36.624 --> 01:19:39.165]  I gashed my leg on the Supreme Court.
[01:19:42.022 --> 01:19:43.363]  Let me talk to Kevin behind the scenes.
[01:19:43.964 --> 01:19:44.404]  Keep going.
[01:19:45.765 --> 01:19:59.596]  We're doing this new thing, Kevin, where PrisonPlanet.tv, this is streaming and the audio stream on the web, so it's not millions of people, it's thousands live right now, and then tens of thousands, millions over the years watching on the web.
[01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:03.680]  Explaining that to people on the web, too, who are watching.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:09.444]  So I wanted to keep talking before we come back with the Lawrence Fishburne thing, because I've also got to plug something, so I'll take up some of your time.
[01:20:10.665 --> 01:20:13.686]  Tell me a little bit about the Arpaio thing.
[01:20:14.106 --> 01:20:14.807]  Let's cover that now.
[01:20:14.827 --> 01:20:19.028]  They're wanting to use your Drug War film to go after Mad Dog Arpaio.
[01:20:19.588 --> 01:20:20.448]  Right.
[01:20:20.528 --> 01:20:39.715]  You know, anybody listening to this who is a voter in the Maricopa County area and wants to see Arpaio get out before he gets into a seventh term needs to be aware that his seat is coming back up again here in November and now is the time to jump on this thing if you're interested in getting him out.
[01:20:41.452 --> 01:20:51.657]  The Democratic Party there in Maricopa County has contacted me, and they're interested in using my drug war footage to create a series of campaign ads, and we're working on that right now.
[01:20:52.677 --> 01:20:55.579]  But our pie, I mean, it's just business as usual.
[01:20:55.619 --> 01:20:58.420]  These guys from a local newspaper there in Phoenix
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:06.486]  Actually, uncovered a deal where Arpaio has been buying millions of dollars in property with cash.
[01:21:06.727 --> 01:21:20.599]  And this is a guy who earns, you know, on the book, $78,000 a year from a government job, and somehow has bought millions of dollars in property with cash, you know, over a couple of years.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:25.904]  And so these guys from a local Phoenix newspaper went and uncovered the court documents
[01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:29.459]  And, and tried to expose this thing in a local newspaper.
[01:21:29.559 --> 01:21:35.564]  Well, Sheriff Joe had them arrested in the middle of the night, had them hauled off in an unmarked car with Mexican license plates.
[01:21:36.585 --> 01:21:39.728]  And, um, and it just created like a really big stir.
[01:21:39.748 --> 01:21:46.854]  And so it really turned the tides on a lot of the local media there, uh, in the Phoenix area being against Sheriff Joe.
[01:21:46.874 --> 01:21:49.857]  But still, I mean, Sheriff Joe, even on the national spotlight, I mean,
[01:21:50.359 --> 01:21:55.842]  I'm watching MSNBC today and they're just, you know, this whole story about Shaq doing the rap about Kobe.
[01:21:55.942 --> 01:22:08.750]  And Sheriff Joe, I mean, he must have a full-time PR team working for him because his name has just become like a regular part of American folklore when they're just talking on MSNBC and Fox News.
[01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:11.838]  You know, Sheriff Joe is just like a normal character.
[01:22:11.858 --> 01:22:12.618]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:22:12.658 --> 01:22:18.082]  He's done a lot of bad stuff, but they're going after him because he is doing what no other sheriff will do, or is allowed to.
[01:22:18.462 --> 01:22:22.325]  He will arrest illegal aliens for no driver's license, no insurance, or drunk driving.
[01:22:22.645 --> 01:22:26.988]  I've had Austin cops tell me, we do not arrest illegals unless they're so drunk they can't walk.
[01:22:27.329 --> 01:22:34.674]  They arrested one of my contractors here for having his license being expired, and they said, yeah, we're told to not arrest illegals for no driver's license.
[01:22:35.074 --> 01:22:36.496]  And he said, it's just the way it is.
[01:22:37.037 --> 01:22:44.486]  And so that's why they're finally going after Arpaio, because he's so mad dog that he's actually doing... But you know what?
[01:22:44.606 --> 01:22:45.727]  It's probably not mad dog.
[01:22:46.048 --> 01:22:53.217]  He knows it's popular to go after illegals with right-wingers, and so he's just arresting a few in here and there to make it look like that, and the Democrats are freaking out.
[01:22:53.457 --> 01:22:53.978]  Kevin, here we go.
[01:23:03.558 --> 01:23:05.379]  Alright, we're going back to Kevin Booth in just a moment.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:13.586]  AmericanDrugWar.com, incredible film, airing on Showtime more than 50 times, very popular.
[01:23:16.488 --> 01:23:23.014]  I have heard buzz for this film all over the place, and since the last time he was on a few months ago.
[01:23:23.554 --> 01:23:25.396]  The buzz just intensifies.
[01:23:26.356 --> 01:23:29.739]  And that's because everything that's Liberty-related is exploding.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.762]  I want to invite everybody out there to come in for the big win.
[01:23:34.473 --> 01:23:37.376]  You're very, very safe fighting the New World Order, unless you're a big fish like me.
[01:23:37.416 --> 01:23:40.538]  And then, your life isn't worth crap, as they say.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.160]  But you know what?
[01:23:43.381 --> 01:23:45.302]  I am committed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:46.283 --> 01:23:48.905]  And we are going into this thing full throttle.
[01:23:50.086 --> 01:23:51.868]  I am committed to this, and I'm going to fight 110%.
[01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:54.269]  So, go to Infowars.com, get American Drug War.
[01:24:02.031 --> 01:24:06.574]  Today on DVD, only $24.95, two hour film, three plus hours of extras.
[01:24:07.014 --> 01:24:09.476]  Or hell, you can go to AmericanDrugWar.com and get it there as well.
[01:24:10.877 --> 01:24:18.623]  But before we go back to my good buddy, Kevin, one little mention, truth rising, my Cinema Verite, no Alex Jones voiceovers.
[01:24:19.123 --> 01:24:20.844]  People that see it are blown away.
[01:24:21.344 --> 01:24:23.766]  It starts shipping the Saturday, July 5th.
[01:24:24.767 --> 01:24:27.208]  Okay, so it's released on the web July 4th.
[01:24:28.223 --> 01:24:30.445]  What is it, 334 years in 1776?
[01:24:31.546 --> 01:24:48.960]  This is a declaration of info war against the New World Order, showing how the first responders were poisoned by the toxic residue of the towers being destroyed, being blown up by the globalists, and then it goes right through to them in Congress at the end, and Congress saying, no, you don't get treatment.
[01:24:50.017 --> 01:24:53.580]  I mean, there is just so much going on, so much happening in this film.
[01:24:54.121 --> 01:24:56.643]  All the activism, the people getting in the politicians' faces.
[01:24:57.103 --> 01:24:59.945]  And it's not some scratchy YouTube clip, and a lot of it isn't on YouTube.
[01:25:00.026 --> 01:25:01.467]  It is the crisp video.
[01:25:02.007 --> 01:25:04.429]  Cops trying to frame people with bombs for protesting.
[01:25:04.489 --> 01:25:04.689]  I mean...
[01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:06.691]  This is a film that needs to be seen.
[01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:07.431]  Truth Rising.
[01:25:07.551 --> 01:25:09.753]  Order it now at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:09.853 --> 01:25:11.654]  It ships in T-minus nine days.
[01:25:12.134 --> 01:25:14.576]  It goes up on the web in T-minus nine days.
[01:25:15.196 --> 01:25:19.138]  That Thursday night at midnight, it will go up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:25:19.639 --> 01:25:24.321]  And we're going to have an MOV file, so it's super high quality.
[01:25:24.822 --> 01:25:27.163]  You can just sit there hammering it onto single disk.
[01:25:27.583 --> 01:25:28.584]  You won't have to convert it.
[01:25:28.604 --> 01:25:29.344]  I want to put a little
[01:25:30.365 --> 01:25:33.187]  tool out there that makes it easy for people like me who aren't good with the web.
[01:25:33.747 --> 01:25:35.728]  A little tool that just says click here to download.
[01:25:35.748 --> 01:25:41.072]  I mean I know they have those little scripts where just directly then will put that MOV on their desk.
[01:25:43.193 --> 01:25:47.076]  Because you know a lot of sites when they let you, you know, say here's a function to put this on your desk.
[01:25:47.096 --> 01:25:49.877]  The point is, I want people knee-deep in these.
[01:25:50.017 --> 01:25:53.740]  I want to see these all over cars in Austin and Detroit and New York.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.582]  I'm begging you, in fact I've been meaning to say this,
[01:25:57.671 --> 01:26:02.019]  I want activists to go absolutely mad dog crazy with Truth Rising.
[01:26:04.263 --> 01:26:05.365]  I mean, we've seen loose change.
[01:26:05.385 --> 01:26:06.187]  We've seen Terror Storm.
[01:26:06.207 --> 01:26:07.409]  We've seen Endgame given out.
[01:26:07.429 --> 01:26:08.751]  Freedom to Fascism given out to people.
[01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:09.252]  That's great.
[01:26:10.302 --> 01:26:14.244]  But I'm telling you, this is the film to spread activism, not just for 9-11 Truth, but everything.
[01:26:14.764 --> 01:26:21.527]  Fighting the drug war, fighting for decriminalization, fighting to defend our borders, all these subjects.
[01:26:22.768 --> 01:26:30.572]  This shows people how to get active, how to get aggressive, how to cover important topics, how to take over the media, how to become activists.
[01:26:30.652 --> 01:26:33.193]  This is something that's really hurting them, it's got them scared.
[01:26:33.673 --> 01:26:37.455]  This is an info weapon that can bring down the New World Order, I'm telling you.
[01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:42.176]  Ladies and gentlemen, TruthRisingInfoWars.com to go order.

[01:28:10.892 --> 01:28:18.835]  Also, there are the fabulous folks at eFoodsDirect, the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:28:21.676 --> 01:28:23.316]  And this is where I've gotten storable foods.
[01:28:23.416 --> 01:28:24.637]  Is it four or five times?
[01:28:25.916 --> 01:28:26.697]  I guess I just ordered some more.
[01:28:26.717 --> 01:28:27.377]  It's five times.
[01:28:27.917 --> 01:28:33.981]  Five times I have ordered food from these folks.
[01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:35.262]  It lasts more than ten years.
[01:28:35.322 --> 01:28:37.944]  It's freeze-dried or dehydrated.
[01:28:38.024 --> 01:28:39.505]  It fits in very small areas.
[01:28:40.225 --> 01:28:45.049]  With all the crazy attention, all the food price increases, all the talk of depression, especially in a place like
[01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:49.111]  Kevin in Los Angeles, a death zone if there's ever a crisis.
[01:28:50.431 --> 01:28:54.834]  Or New York, ten times worse.
[01:28:54.854 --> 01:28:55.494]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:28:55.514 --> 01:28:57.275]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:28:57.795 --> 01:29:01.697]  Because you gotta have food and water, folks.
[01:29:01.717 --> 01:29:02.137]  800-409-5633.
[01:29:02.998 --> 01:29:05.079]  Okay, let's go back to Kevin Booth.
[01:29:06.079 --> 01:29:15.124]  Kevin, you were finishing up, we were talking about Joe Arpaio, just going crazier and crazier, and now the Democrats want to use your American Drug War film to go after him.
[01:29:16.277 --> 01:29:24.323]  Yeah, I've been contacted by the head of the Democratic Party there in Maricopa County, and they've got a new guy that they want to put against him.
[01:29:24.363 --> 01:29:31.588]  But, you know, usually in a sheriff race, you wouldn't even hear about this until September, with the election being in November.
[01:29:31.648 --> 01:29:39.693]  But with Sheriff Joe being in his sixth term, going for his seventh term, it's going to take a lot to turn the tides on this guy.
[01:29:39.713 --> 01:29:45.958]  You know, there's just the recent deal where we were just talking about on the internet break about
[01:29:47.156 --> 01:30:12.346]  How, you know, Sheriff Joe has been purchasing land, paying for cash, he's been, you know, buying, it's on the books, over a million dollars for the property, using cash money, and this is a guy on a fixed government income, and so these guys with the local press, the New Times in Phoenix, went after him, they pulled some court documents, and Sheriff Joe had these guys arrested in the middle of the night, hauled off in some unmarked vehicle with Mexican license plates.
[01:30:13.178 --> 01:30:29.110]  And because of that, it's created a new outrage in the Phoenix area, but still, with all the conservatives there in the Phoenix area, you know, let's face it, Phoenix being one of the last places to have MLK Day, on and on, it ain't gonna be easy to get them out.
[01:30:32.513 --> 01:30:33.613]  Continue with that, Kevin.
[01:30:34.334 --> 01:30:41.779]  Well, you know, I mean, that's, you know, so they're gonna create a series of ads using my film, and
[01:30:43.452 --> 01:30:50.398]  I just think, I urge anybody in the Maricopa area, anybody who's a voter, to get involved with this.
[01:30:51.879 --> 01:30:54.441]  It's going to take a lot.
[01:30:54.801 --> 01:31:06.450]  This is a guy that has created a local empire from fighting the drug war, from being, he's made himself popular.
[01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:10.954]  He's like a regular personality now on Fox News, on CNN.
[01:31:12.694 --> 01:31:14.396]  I don't think so.
[01:31:31.784 --> 01:31:38.168]  And really, I mean, he's profiting from the more drug seizures that they can make.
[01:31:38.288 --> 01:31:42.631]  I mean, how is it that... Kevin, you're believing his PR firm, bro.
[01:31:42.651 --> 01:31:44.712]  The people don't like Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:52.497]  I mean, you may have liked the people who are all about to die, who are like 90 years old, who believe the television set, but that's about it.
[01:31:53.138 --> 01:31:53.418]  Yeah.
[01:31:54.679 --> 01:31:56.740]  Well, I know a lot of people in Phoenix that like him.
[01:31:58.976 --> 01:32:10.466]  You know, I actually have some family there that love him, you know, and it's not going to be easy to get him out, so I think anybody who's interested... Look, he's the wave of the future, Kevin.
[01:32:10.846 --> 01:32:16.771]  They're hiring thousands and thousands every year more aggravated felons for the military and police.
[01:32:16.791 --> 01:32:20.314]  Travis County's legalized hiring felons for their Sheriff's Department now.
[01:32:21.846 --> 01:32:26.209]  Oh, I mean, it'll be literally, literally, aggravated felons will rule us.
[01:32:26.269 --> 01:32:28.471]  I mean, it's just so sick, man.
[01:32:28.711 --> 01:32:37.436]  Well, at least in L.A., you only have to belong to the KKK to join the LAPD, so... You're talking about the Vikings, huh?
[01:32:38.497 --> 01:32:39.978]  Oh, got a helicopter in front of my house?
[01:32:40.058 --> 01:32:43.060]  No, I'm just kidding.
[01:32:44.801 --> 01:32:45.581]  You know, that's true.
[01:32:45.601 --> 01:32:49.044]  I was at a Waco Ku Klux Klan rally protesting it.
[01:32:49.966 --> 01:32:52.429]  Because they were saying kill the Davidians and stuff like that.
[01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:55.894]  And there's these big fat federal agents, and it later came out they were feds.
[01:32:56.916 --> 01:32:59.499]  And I'm there, and I'm going, you're big fat federal agents.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.621]  And it's just footage of this.
[01:33:01.801 --> 01:33:03.522]  And I walk over and they're death-threatening me.
[01:33:03.542 --> 01:33:07.864]  The guy's going, my Second Amendment means I can murder you to make the Second Amendment look bad for news cameras.
[01:33:08.485 --> 01:33:10.126]  And I'm going, you big fat federal agent.
[01:33:10.146 --> 01:33:13.388]  And I walk over to the police and I said, look, he just said he wants to murder me.
[01:33:13.468 --> 01:33:14.548]  And they were like, get back!
[01:33:14.969 --> 01:33:15.889]  Because there wasn't a camera.
[01:33:15.909 --> 01:33:19.071]  They were like, camera got some of the bullhorny, but get back, Invisible Empire!
[01:33:19.771 --> 01:33:21.973]  And I was like, oh, Invisible Empire, which means, you know, Klan.
[01:33:22.893 --> 01:33:24.354]  And it's just all over, folks.
[01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:25.375]  It's just, it's all over.
[01:33:26.957 --> 01:33:27.417]  Oh my God.
[01:33:27.478 --> 01:33:29.779]  I mean, it's just totally insane.
[01:33:30.740 --> 01:33:31.180]  Oh my God.
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.121]  You know what it is?
[01:33:32.161 --> 01:33:42.169]  There's so many cowardly scumbag people, and I don't just mean the police, and they're just all going to serve evil until they're totally bankrupt like the Germans with their cities completely bombed out and invaded.
[01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.910]  Well, that's what I mean.
[01:33:44.010 --> 01:33:52.377]  Everybody that, you know, look, everybody out there listening to this, you have family, you have friends that believe in what the other side is doing.
[01:33:53.186 --> 01:33:54.627]  Those are the people you need to talk to.
[01:33:54.827 --> 01:34:04.352]  You know, I try to talk to my relatives and friends and just say, you know, people that are still Bush supporters even, and go, what are you getting out of this?
[01:34:04.432 --> 01:34:06.993]  I mean, you know, you belong to this team.
[01:34:07.033 --> 01:34:11.175]  You're still... For this, it's like, what is it doing for you?
[01:34:11.215 --> 01:34:13.096]  And they, you know, they're just scared.
[01:34:13.156 --> 01:34:16.078]  They're all really just, they're just afraid is really what it's all about.
[01:34:16.798 --> 01:34:20.380]  And so they want to, they think like belonging to the winning team
[01:34:21.089 --> 01:34:24.171]  Be a part of the big winning team is what's going to save them in the end.
[01:34:24.531 --> 01:34:26.893]  Well, wait until the Democrats get in office, Kevin.
[01:34:26.933 --> 01:34:35.199]  It's going to be a new winning team with that, and all the Bush agenda is just going to continue with different window dressing, and suddenly Democrats are going to love the Military Commissions Act.
[01:34:35.579 --> 01:34:35.819]  Watch.
[01:34:35.839 --> 01:34:36.040]  Yeah.
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:36.660]  Watch.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.020]  Yeah.
[01:34:38.561 --> 01:34:40.183]  But, you know, what are you going to do, though?
[01:34:40.203 --> 01:34:41.824]  I mean, would you rather have that or McCain?
[01:34:41.864 --> 01:34:42.504]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:34:42.884 --> 01:34:46.787]  Well, I'd rather have... It's like, do you want to be shot in the head with a shotgun or a .30-06?
[01:34:47.087 --> 01:34:48.929]  You know, I don't want to be shot in the head.
[01:34:50.569 --> 01:34:52.631]  We have to recognize it's a false choice.
[01:34:53.231 --> 01:34:54.131]  Yeah, no, I know that.
[01:34:54.251 --> 01:34:54.712]  I know that.
[01:34:54.872 --> 01:35:04.697]  I know, but still, I mean, looking back, I mean, I still have to wonder what would be the difference right now had it been Carrier-Bush for the last four years.
[01:35:04.778 --> 01:35:06.879]  You know, he would be just de-accelerated.
[01:35:06.939 --> 01:35:08.039]  Exact same thing.
[01:35:08.199 --> 01:35:08.680]  Exactly.
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:10.421]  Stage the attack, same deal.
[01:35:10.841 --> 01:35:12.222]  Maybe a little slower, though.
[01:35:12.402 --> 01:35:13.362]  Maybe a little slower.
[01:35:13.703 --> 01:35:14.043]  I don't know.
[01:35:15.623 --> 01:35:27.592]  Maybe only because conservatives, real grassroots conservatives, are the ones that fight gun control, open borders, police state in the past, and that they knew they had to have a Republican in so they would all be pacified.
[01:35:28.093 --> 01:35:30.474]  Because, yeah, the Democrats would have tried to triple
[01:35:31.255 --> 01:35:32.055]  It's now tripled.
[01:35:32.095 --> 01:35:33.196]  It was doubled five years in.
[01:35:33.236 --> 01:35:36.117]  It's now tripled the size of the federal government.
[01:35:36.257 --> 01:35:36.938]  Tripled!
[01:35:37.438 --> 01:35:43.141]  In seven and a half years, Republicans would have never put up with that, but when Bush does, it's, I love triple the government!
[01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:43.841]  It's good!
[01:35:44.161 --> 01:35:45.482]  Oh, yeah, baby!
[01:35:45.802 --> 01:35:48.083]  Oh, shut up, communist!
[01:35:49.203 --> 01:35:50.104]  Yeah, no, exactly.
[01:35:50.124 --> 01:35:50.624]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:52.045]  I heard the communist thing.
[01:35:52.465 --> 01:35:54.666]  That's, um... What about George Carlin?
[01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:57.212]  Not very sad, you know.
[01:35:57.232 --> 01:36:06.083]  I just got to show, though, that if a 71-year-old man can just suddenly drop dead, I think George is probably in much better shape than McCain.
[01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:11.775]  Uh, you know, there's a reason I don't want to have a 75-year-old guy to be the president.
[01:36:11.835 --> 01:36:16.196]  Well, I'll tell you this, Obama will not live long until Hillary's his VP.
[01:36:16.576 --> 01:36:18.077]  He's got to be smart enough to know that.
[01:36:18.157 --> 01:36:19.637]  Crocodile right there, boy.
[01:36:19.677 --> 01:36:23.398]  Yeah, no, it'll be amazing if Obama can survive for a year.
[01:36:23.698 --> 01:36:28.679]  No, it'll, you know, it'll be crazy to see what happens if he gets in.
[01:36:30.403 --> 01:36:41.471]  Yeah, they'll probably kill him and have a white supremacist mind control guy do it, and then they'll ban guns because of it, and black folks will burn down every city in the country, and then they'll use that for martial law.
[01:36:42.192 --> 01:36:45.174]  Any way you cut it, it's... I think George Carlin's right.
[01:36:45.194 --> 01:36:46.095]  I think the country's done.
[01:36:47.376 --> 01:36:49.277]  George Carlin, you know, you've got to give it to him.
[01:36:49.337 --> 01:36:54.361]  I mean, George Carlin was talking about this stuff back in the 70s, you know?
[01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:58.284]  I mean, I would definitely say that George Carlin was a
[01:36:59.351 --> 01:37:05.234]  The godfather of a lot of this movement right now, and I think a lot of people owe a lot to him.
[01:37:05.794 --> 01:37:15.638]  Well, I'm not big on his atheist thing, but at the same time, he's saying how they're dumbing you down on purpose, and the wars, and I mean, I think Bill Hicks got a lot from him, didn't he?
[01:37:16.298 --> 01:37:17.298]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:17.338 --> 01:37:27.943]  I mean, I can't imagine anybody, you know, trying to do that brand, that breed of comedy will sit there and say that they don't owe a lot to George Carlin.
[01:37:29.868 --> 01:37:31.797]  Charlton Heston, George Carlin.
[01:37:32.796 --> 01:37:36.219]  Been a bunch of other high-profile deaths this year.
[01:37:36.279 --> 01:37:42.843]  Yeah, but I would say Richard Pryor, to me Richard Pryor and George Carlin were the kings.
[01:37:43.184 --> 01:37:52.390]  And although Lenny Bruce has gotten all the accolades for being the guy that broke all these boundaries, I have to admit when I go back and listen to Lenny Bruce albums, they're just not that funny to me.
[01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:53.331]  It's not funny.
[01:37:53.351 --> 01:37:54.692]  Richard Pryor's funny.
[01:37:55.092 --> 01:37:57.054]  Yeah, Richard Pryor's amazing.
[01:37:57.074 --> 01:37:58.355]  Didn't you talk to Richard Pryor?
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:05.963]  I got to, like, kind of communicate with him right before he died, you know, through his wife.
[01:38:08.885 --> 01:38:09.905]  Did you tell me you talked to him?
[01:38:09.945 --> 01:38:11.847]  We tell so many stories, but he couldn't really talk?
[01:38:11.867 --> 01:38:13.608]  Yeah, he couldn't really talk.
[01:38:13.668 --> 01:38:15.029]  I kept trying to go to his house.
[01:38:15.129 --> 01:38:27.097]  I gave him a bunch of Bill Hicks stuff, and just told him what a big influence he was to Bill, and he, you know, smiled and gave me the thumbs up and all that, and he died just a couple weeks later.
[01:38:28.221 --> 01:38:31.443]  Oh, so you did physically visit with him, or his wife told you he was smiling?
[01:38:31.603 --> 01:38:34.385]  Yeah, no, his wife was just sitting there with him on the phone.
[01:38:35.066 --> 01:38:40.149]  They kept inviting me over, and every time I'd be in route, she'd call and say I'm having a rush from the hospital.
[01:38:40.209 --> 01:38:44.833]  It happened like three times in a row, and I just kind of ducked out of this.
[01:38:46.274 --> 01:38:47.494]  He was already so sick.
[01:38:49.236 --> 01:38:51.157]  Richard Pryor, man, he is so funny.
[01:38:51.617 --> 01:38:53.739]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:54.239 --> 01:38:57.041]  I mean, you watch Chris Rock or somebody, that's not even funny.
[01:38:58.587 --> 01:39:03.808]  Yeah, it's funny to go now, when you go back and watch those Eddie Murphy concerts, boy, those things sure got dated.
[01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:13.411]  You know, or watching Eddie Murphy wearing those leather jumpsuits and being all tough and cool, like right after he left FNL, it's like, oh boy, that got dated fast.
[01:39:14.151 --> 01:39:15.271]  Richard Pryor didn't, though?
[01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:18.192]  No, no, Richard Pryor stuff, you can watch that.
[01:39:18.372 --> 01:39:25.694]  You know, I recommend people watch that Richard Pryor live on the Sunset Strip, one of the first recorded comedy concert films that
[01:39:26.358 --> 01:39:30.760]  Bill took me to the theater probably ten times in a row to watch the thing over and over again.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:35.502]  We filmed the Sane Man film, which is Bill's first feature-length film that I produced.
[01:39:36.402 --> 01:39:41.744]  We completely based the whole thing on wanting to kind of look like that and sound like that and feel like that.
[01:39:43.225 --> 01:39:45.846]  So anybody out there should check out the Richard Pryor.
[01:39:45.926 --> 01:39:48.127]  It runs on cable, Showtime, every so often.
[01:39:49.007 --> 01:39:51.828]  Another guy that's really good too is Paul Mooney.
[01:39:51.928 --> 01:39:53.089]  He was a big
[01:39:55.131 --> 01:39:55.752]  That's incredible, Kevin.
[01:40:08.365 --> 01:40:09.386]  Yeah, it's just so weird.
[01:40:09.406 --> 01:40:16.590]  You don't expect somebody like George Carlin or all these other people that are dying, Charlton Heston, and they're just gone.
[01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:28.858]  And it reminds you, and then in my own personal life, people dying around me, and I got a great uncle who I really like who's dying, real sick, and it just makes you enjoy life a lot more, I'll tell you that.
[01:40:28.878 --> 01:40:30.459]  It makes me appreciate every moment I got, Kevin.

[01:44:15.529 --> 01:44:17.190]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:18.670]  You can only be serious so much.
[01:44:21.731 --> 01:44:23.231]  His film is amazing.
[01:44:23.291 --> 01:44:24.071]  American Drug War.
[01:44:24.091 --> 01:44:26.471]  Available at Infowars.com.
[01:44:31.332 --> 01:44:33.152]  But I interrupted him with a break.
[01:44:33.172 --> 01:44:34.973]  He never got to his Lawrence Fishburne story.
[01:44:34.993 --> 01:44:39.874]  So why not mix a little bit of funny stuff in with all the hellish stuff that's going on around us.
[01:44:40.354 --> 01:44:41.494]  Kevin, tell that story.
[01:44:42.751 --> 01:44:47.353]  Well, everybody out here in Hollywood has their celebrity stalking story.
[01:44:47.613 --> 01:44:53.496]  Even Joe Rogan had a story where he just kept thinking that Kelsey Grammer kept thinking that Joe Rogan was stalking him.
[01:44:53.516 --> 01:44:57.117]  Well, it turns out I bought this house up here in Hollywood Hills.
[01:44:57.197 --> 01:45:00.599]  It's actually in a famous... It was part of a famous murder investigation.
[01:45:00.659 --> 01:45:05.521]  If you look up death in the Hollywood Hills, you'll see my house in a famous murder case.
[01:45:06.865 --> 01:45:08.325]  There was a murder in your house?
[01:45:09.106 --> 01:45:11.966]  They never proved that it happened in here, although they said that it did.
[01:45:12.006 --> 01:45:12.827]  You have to watch it.
[01:45:12.967 --> 01:45:15.767]  MSNBC did a one-hour... Okay, I didn't know that.
[01:45:15.827 --> 01:45:17.568]  Now I'm really not going to stay there when I'm there next time.
[01:45:17.888 --> 01:45:18.848]  Ah, no, it's great.
[01:45:19.168 --> 01:45:19.748]  I'm joking.
[01:45:19.788 --> 01:45:24.850]  Anyway, so Lawrence Fishburne lived here during the making of the first Matrix film.
[01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:26.450]  I guess he was gone a lot, whatever.
[01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:34.692]  But I was running on the dog trail with this place, this running canyon, where everybody goes, lots of people there.
[01:45:35.453 --> 01:45:42.336]  And I ran into him, and I walked up to him, and I said, the address of the house, and he was like, oh yeah, well, you know, I said, oh, I bought that place, and we were just talking about it and all that.
[01:45:43.217 --> 01:45:47.519]  And I thought that I asked him if he knew who Bill Hicks was, and I thought that he said yes, right?
[01:45:48.079 --> 01:45:55.082]  So it turns out this guy who was doing editing for me through these other people knew his home address, his new home address, so I mailed him a book, right?
[01:45:55.102 --> 01:45:56.943]  Um, a Bill Hicks book.
[01:45:57.343 --> 01:46:05.087]  So now, a couple days later, I'm out on this other trail, but now it's this place where you park your car, it's like five miles into the woods, out in the middle of nowhere,
[01:46:05.638 --> 01:46:10.360]  And here I run into Lawrence Fishburne and I go, hey, did you get that book?
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.721]  He just turns around and he's just like, who are you?
[01:46:14.781 --> 01:46:15.402]  What do you want?
[01:46:15.622 --> 01:46:18.083]  And I was like, uh, no, no, it's like that.
[01:46:18.103 --> 01:46:19.603]  He's like, why did you send that to my house?
[01:46:19.643 --> 01:46:20.083]  Who are you?
[01:46:20.103 --> 01:46:20.884]  What are you trying to do?
[01:46:21.444 --> 01:46:23.264]  And I was like, no, no, it's not like that, man.
[01:46:23.304 --> 01:46:27.266]  And then, and then, um, and then I ran into him again out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:46:27.286 --> 01:46:30.007]  I just by complete chance, um,
[01:46:30.916 --> 01:46:34.857]  I'm talking in another location where I'm just out in the middle of the woods.
[01:46:34.897 --> 01:46:36.317]  What did he do then?
[01:46:37.277 --> 01:46:38.798]  He held his ground.
[01:46:38.938 --> 01:46:40.658]  He's exactly like you would think.
[01:46:40.698 --> 01:46:43.199]  He's this huge disciplinary kind of guy.
[01:46:43.479 --> 01:46:45.579]  Did you just laugh and say, I'm not stalking?
[01:46:45.939 --> 01:46:48.020]  Yeah, it was just so classic.
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:52.941]  I started asking him if he knew who Ricky Ross was and all that and he thought I was completely insane.
[01:46:54.602 --> 01:46:57.503]  I wanted you to get on and talk about Ricky Ross and government drug dealing.
[01:46:57.523 --> 01:47:00.925]  I'll have to have you back on about that soon or the murder of Gary Webb.
[01:47:00.945 --> 01:47:03.106]  Kevin, I really appreciate you coming on.
[01:47:03.606 --> 01:47:04.446]  What happened with Joe?
[01:47:04.807 --> 01:47:07.208]  She thought he was stalking him or he thought she was stalking him?
[01:47:08.228 --> 01:47:09.409]  Oh, you're talking about Joe Rogan?
[01:47:10.331 --> 01:47:17.012]  Oh, no, there was a story, I think, where everywhere Joe went, Kelsey Grammar thought that Joe was stalking him.
[01:47:17.032 --> 01:47:20.973]  You know, just like you talk about complete two completely.
[01:47:21.013 --> 01:47:22.353]  Show out on who Kelsey Grammar is.
[01:47:22.413 --> 01:47:23.213]  I thought it was a she.
[01:47:23.673 --> 01:47:24.293]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:47:25.074 --> 01:47:25.574]  Oh, God.
[01:47:26.934 --> 01:47:27.914]  It's all funny, Kevin.
[01:47:28.174 --> 01:47:30.154]  Hey, man, how's your wife doing?
[01:47:30.755 --> 01:47:31.535]  Great, great.
[01:47:31.575 --> 01:47:33.355]  We just had our ninth wedding anniversary.
[01:47:33.395 --> 01:47:36.476]  We went to Carmel-by-the-Sea, where home started.
[01:47:36.496 --> 01:47:38.236]  Three million dollars for three bedrooms.
[01:47:39.557 --> 01:47:40.041]  All right, man.
[01:47:40.081 --> 01:47:41.310]  Have fun out in Babylon, Kevin.
[01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.995]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.420]  Alright, everybody check out American Drug War.
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:50.702]  We have a new player on there that has all these interviews up on it and also a new blog thing up on americandrugwar.com.
[01:47:50.862 --> 01:47:51.082]  Good.
[01:47:51.562 --> 01:47:53.083]  And get the DVD at infowars.com.
[01:47:53.223 --> 01:47:54.543]  Don't buy it from Kevin, he's bad!
[01:47:54.883 --> 01:47:55.723]  I'm joking, Kevin.
[01:47:56.143 --> 01:47:56.563]  Alright.
[01:47:56.823 --> 01:47:58.024]  Hey, buddy, I'll talk to you soon.
[01:47:58.544 --> 01:47:59.064]  Okay, alright.
[01:47:59.264 --> 01:47:59.824]  Take care, bye.
[01:48:00.404 --> 01:48:01.004]  Alright, folks.
[01:48:01.064 --> 01:48:07.326]  Had a little lighter discussion there in the last 40 minutes after total proof the government blew up the towers earlier.
[01:48:07.526 --> 01:48:10.407]  Absolutely off the charts with this new NIST report.
[01:48:11.997 --> 01:48:14.580]  The other news with all the crazy police state stuff.
[01:48:15.141 --> 01:48:16.323]  Amazing broadcast.
[01:48:16.383 --> 01:48:20.728]  If you missed any of the first three hours, they already start right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:20.768 --> 01:48:23.252]  If not, I'll be back tomorrow live here on the MNFM dial.
[01:48:23.292 --> 01:48:30.461]  But as I said, right now, it all starts restreaming four hours back to back at the streams only at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:31.382 --> 01:48:31.783]  God bless.
[01:48:31.803 --> 01:48:34.166]  Thank you for listening.
[01:48:34.806 --> 01:48:35.227]  Take care.
