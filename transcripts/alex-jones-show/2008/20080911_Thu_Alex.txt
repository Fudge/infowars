[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:06.050]  Scamming the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.691]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.
[00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:14.372]  Spray Your Plate is a spray on photo blocker that protects against all types of cameras.
[00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:20.713]  Spray Your Plate photo blocker spray reflects and protects against flash photo images making your plate unreadable.
[00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:26.934]  One can of photo blocker will pay for itself many times over, last forever, and is completely undetectable.
[00:00:26.954 --> 00:00:28.014]  Tell that long-tongued liar
[00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:07.318]  Well, we're already about 25 minutes into our interview with William Engdahl, investigative journalist, author, academic researcher, amazing individual.
[00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:11.062]  I want to make this clear.
[00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:13.924]  GMO was created by the eugenicist.
[00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:17.655]  They understand that breeding and seeds and animals is key.
[00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:22.739]  And they've just conditioned us to announce, hey, clone beef on store shelves now, without labels.
[00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:26.522]  Clone chickens, clone cows, it's all out there now, it's all been announced.
[00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:30.144]  Oh, we're doing cross-species human hybrids for organ harvesting.
[00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.747]  But we're keeping them small, down at the little embryo level.
[00:01:34.107 --> 00:01:36.049]  Then you read deeper in the research, they're not.
[00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:37.550]  That's the stuff they admit.
[00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:40.892]  Splicing humans with pigs, insects.
[00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:46.734]  Going back 20 years ago, they had meant spiders with goats for body armor.
[00:01:49.395 --> 00:02:02.999]  It is completely out of control, and I've had all these top genetic engineers, people that were running major companies making millions a year, and they would feed a new potato with one gene changed to the rats, and half the rats would die.
[00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:04.680]  And then if you kept feeding it, they'd all die.
[00:02:05.778 --> 00:02:07.700]  And they'd say, we've got to tell the public.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.441]  And they'd say, no.
[00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:10.743]  And then magically, see this is a perfect crime.
[00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:16.307]  Because very few people can go look at this and study this and then do the multi-million dollar test to see what it does.
[00:02:16.347 --> 00:02:18.750]  But when they find out, they know what the studies are doing.
[00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.774]  When other groups and other institutions study it, they find it's sterilizing mammals.
[00:02:23.974 --> 00:02:25.976]  It's toxifying them, increasing cancer.
[00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:29.259]  They're finding mutations after gestation.
[00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:40.838]  Which they'd always thought you got deformities, you know, during early embryonic development, but they're finding rats and guinea pigs and things are getting deformed.
[00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:46.514]  And having deformities with organs and things after they're born.
[00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:49.956]  I mean, this is mega massive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:54.097]  That's some of the things I wanted to throw out there, because this is so diabolical.
[00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:57.118]  I know he says it gets into all that, but I want to get your take on that.
[00:02:57.618 --> 00:03:02.740]  So continue walking us through this story that you cover in your amazing investigative book, sir.
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.560]  Please continue.
[00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.602]  Let's take the geopolitics a step further in time and go to the year 1992, some time after this whole
[00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:26.864]  GMO project was started by the Rockefeller Foundation, and we have a meeting, a closed door White House meeting, unpublicized, between George Herbert Walker Bush, the president at the time, and the president of Monsanto in St.
[00:03:26.904 --> 00:03:38.173]  Louis, the leading patenter of genetically modified seeds, and also the chemical herbicides that are uniquely suited to those GMO seeds, like
[00:03:39.913 --> 00:03:45.494]  Roundup Ready Soybean Seeds and Roundup Herbicide by Monsanto.
[00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:46.374]  You have to have both.
[00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:58.016]  So anyway, Monsanto sat down with Papa Bush in 1992 and said, look, this can be a huge... This was the public version of what they said.
[00:03:58.036 --> 00:03:59.997]  I can imagine what they said in private.
[00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:03.637]  This can be a huge boon, a new growth area for the U.S.
[00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:07.858]  economy, biotechnology, genetically modified seeds and so forth.
[00:04:08.453 --> 00:04:15.237]  But in order for the private sector to really do its stuff, we need to be free to be creative.
[00:04:15.697 --> 00:04:17.258]  Free from government meddling.
[00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:25.163]  So, Father Bush signed an executive order that is called the Substantial Equivalence Order.
[00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:31.686]  Now, listeners should write that down and study that word and look it up under Google, because it's worth looking.
[00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:36.929]  Substantial Equivalent means, according to Bush, according to this executive department order in 1992,
[00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:43.446]  The GMO corn or GMO soybean is to henceforth be treated
[00:04:44.258 --> 00:04:50.603]  As substantially equivalent to a normal ear of corn or a normal sprout of soybeans.
[00:04:50.703 --> 00:05:05.335]  So they wave a magic wand, no more testing, no more nothing, put whatever you want on their plates, add other animal, insect, plant, DNA to it, just, just, just, I'm, I'm, I'm the judge, jury, I'm now the EPA and the FDA, I wave a wand.
[00:05:05.715 --> 00:05:11.420]  The EPA and the FDA then was, was staffed by Monsanto people or people from DuPont and
[00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:23.068]  In a revolving door system, and they would write the rules for the EPA, the EPA would accept the tests of Monsanto as Bible truth, and never second-guess them.
[00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:35.540]  I mean, the criminal conflict of interest here is just staggering, and most Americans think, well, we have a Food and Drug Administration that is mandated to protect the food and health of the American people.
[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.582]  Well, guess again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:40.905]  They aren't doing that in Washington since at least 1992.
[00:05:41.085 --> 00:05:45.188]  Briefly, briefly, I just want to add this and I'm going to try to let you go, there's just so much, I want to back up.
[00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:57.718]  Remember the different university studies they did in the US and Europe where they found that if an authority figure said kill one in a test, they thought in the university they were really killing people.
[00:05:58.158 --> 00:06:05.964]  Ninety plus percent of the time they would commit the murder just because an authority figure told them it was okay to do in a university study.
[00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:07.085]  Remember the electroshocks?
[00:06:07.685 --> 00:06:08.506]  It's the same thing.
[00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:11.890]  The President says, no more restrictions, no more testing.
[00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.334]  They would then follow the orders, even though whistleblowers came out and said, this is deadly.
[00:06:16.635 --> 00:06:17.716]  This is going to kill people.
[00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:18.777]  They just said, nope.
[00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:20.399]  The President says it's good.
[00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:33.996]  Well, one of the most famous cases of whistleblowers, a dear friend of mine, Dr. Arpad Pustai, who was interviewed in Scotland, and he was fired from Rowett Research Institute at the time, 1997.
[00:06:34.036 --> 00:06:42.104]  He was the world's leading GMO researcher and thought it was a positive boon for mankind, a solution to world hunger.
[00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:47.869]  And he did exactly the kind of research you're talking about, with laboratory rats and potatoes.
[00:06:48.453 --> 00:06:50.254]  And this man is no amateur.
[00:06:50.314 --> 00:06:58.100]  He's now 77 years old and a highly, highly informed and careful scientist.
[00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:07.988]  And he found that the brains, the inner organs of the rats fed on GMO potatoes diet for more than three months were dramatically shrunken.
[00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:12.708]  And he told his boss and said, we have to sound the alarm on this.
[00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:16.109]  They went on Channel 4, a prominent British television channel.
[00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:18.510]  It was picked up all around the world for 72 hours.
[00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.071]  And then suddenly, it was dead in the water.
[00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:22.652]  You never heard another word about it.
[00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:23.632]  And they fired him.
[00:07:23.872 --> 00:07:25.973]  Thank God for him blowing the whistle.
[00:07:25.993 --> 00:07:27.234]  I interviewed him several times.
[00:07:27.534 --> 00:07:29.194]  I've dropped out of touch with him.
[00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:30.175]  I need to get his number again.
[00:07:30.535 --> 00:07:31.595]  We had a computer fail.
[00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:32.856]  I need to get him back on, but go ahead.
[00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:34.417]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:07:34.517 --> 00:07:37.738]  He's more than willing to talk about these dangers.
[00:07:38.334 --> 00:07:46.056]  But as he puts it, basically the British government was willing to make the population human guinea pigs and something that should be
[00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:57.694]  At the very, very minimum, 20 or more years of long-term, totally controlled animal studies before the genie is released and set forth on the human species.
[00:07:57.714 --> 00:07:59.395]  And by the way, you just glazed over that.
[00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:00.576]  It did a lot more to the rats.
[00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:03.297]  It caused the bizarre afterbirth deformity.
[00:08:03.397 --> 00:08:07.199]  It caused them to have intestinal tumors, all sorts of medical problems.
[00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:12.841]  These were some other experiments, as far as I know, but... Yeah, well, on my show he was covering the other experiments.
[00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:13.642]  Okay, but that... Yeah.
[00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.894]  In other words, it's highly unstable as Dr. Pustai repeatedly points out.
[00:08:23.194 --> 00:08:25.636]  This is not some stable alteration.
[00:08:26.017 --> 00:08:28.619]  It's not like hybrid corn where you breed two
[00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.810]  Two strains of corn for weather resistance.
[00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.592]  This is introducing foreign genetic material.
[00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:39.253]  This is unnatural alteration of the DNA.
[00:08:39.313 --> 00:08:40.874]  But that's what Rush Limbaugh does.
[00:08:40.914 --> 00:08:46.116]  He goes on and he says, when you breed two dogs, that's genetic engineering.
[00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:51.798]  When you cross the corn, like George Washington Carver, but that's natural breeding.
[00:08:52.119 --> 00:08:55.080]  That's how things naturally mixed in the wild.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.721]  It's the same species.
[00:08:56.781 --> 00:09:04.445]  It's not with a gene gun, firing reptile genetics into a salmon gene, and then putting that in corn.
[00:09:04.886 --> 00:09:05.586]  Yeah.
[00:09:06.106 --> 00:09:12.810]  Well, let me give another example, which is, I think, one of the emblematic examples.
[00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.353]  In 2001, a small San Diego biotech company called Epoceet, maybe you've heard of it.
[00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:19.114]  A few people have.
[00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:22.977]  Epoceet, the president of Epoceet, gave a press conference.
[00:09:23.017 --> 00:09:23.597]  He was just as
[00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:26.357]  Pleased as punch to announce this to the world.
[00:09:27.298 --> 00:09:32.663]  And he said, back behind me we have a greenhouse full of spermicidal corn.
[00:09:33.324 --> 00:09:41.412]  That is corn genetically modified so that men, this is not animals, men who eat this corn will become sterile.
[00:09:42.773 --> 00:09:44.875]  And it's a spermicide, it kills sperm.
[00:09:45.616 --> 00:09:48.859]  And he said this is a solution to the world population problem.
[00:09:50.763 --> 00:10:00.311]  Now, if you live in Mexico, you know how, or if you even travel through Mexico and Central America, you know that corn is a staple of the peasant diet.
[00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:13.762]  And that's going to jump into other corn, open-air planted, just like protegene, with the AIDS virus jackets in the corn, and then that happened eight years ago and was quietly covered up.
[00:10:14.923 --> 00:10:15.464]  Unbelievable.
[00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:38.158]  Scientists from Stanford Universities put it, you would think that no one in their right mind would do something like this, but as he put it, and he worked on the Jason Project with the Pentagon as a biologist and so forth, so he knew a little bit the inside story, he said, not everybody is in their right mind.
[00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:41.200]  And that, I think, sums it up.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.402]  There are people in a power elite,
[00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:53.411]  For them, power is a self-feeding aphrodisiac of some perverse sort that I don't fully understand, but they are different from ordinary human beings.
[00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:57.394]  Human life is, for them, simply an externality.
[00:11:00.551 --> 00:11:05.213]  Their friends are provided for as they see fit than the rest of the human species.
[00:11:05.594 --> 00:11:06.314]  Well, I agree.
[00:11:06.594 --> 00:11:07.775]  I agree, but it's worse than that.
[00:11:07.815 --> 00:11:17.360]  A lot of top futurists, top globalists have written, and history shows it with Nero and the craziness, Vlad the Impaler.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.783]  They go crazy and they become nihilistic and self-destructive.
[00:11:22.703 --> 00:11:24.304]  And so you hear them writing about it.
[00:11:24.724 --> 00:11:29.547]  Even the head people at Hadron are saying, well, there's a small chance it'll destroy the Earth, but we don't care.
[00:11:29.847 --> 00:11:31.908]  And they put the death god Shiva above it.
[00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:35.010]  Or you talk to these geneticists and they go, so what?
[00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:40.173]  So if we make something that takes over the planet, that's regular evolution because we evolved and did it.
[00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.874]  And so what if it kills us all?
[00:11:41.894 --> 00:11:42.694]  We need to be killed.
[00:11:42.974 --> 00:11:45.416]  I mean, these are maniacs and they get off
[00:11:45.836 --> 00:11:53.560]  Unlike driving a car at 100 miles an hour around jagged turns, a lot of Hollywood folks do stuff like that and get killed, like James Dean.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.042]  It is just a complete mania.
[00:11:56.062 --> 00:11:56.962]  Yep, yep.
[00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:11.330]  And now, go back a little bit to the 1950s, because the Rockefeller Foundation again was behind this project called the Agribusiness Project of the Harvard Business School.
[00:12:12.037 --> 00:12:16.223]  John W. Davis, who was a former Assistant Agriculture Secretary under Eisenhower.
[00:12:16.824 --> 00:12:22.091]  Ray Goldberg, who is still kicking at age 91 and sits on the board of several GMO companies.
[00:12:23.674 --> 00:12:26.818]  Goldberg and Davis created something called agribusiness.
[00:12:26.838 --> 00:12:27.900]  They invented the term.
[00:12:29.148 --> 00:12:41.131]  And what their goal was, was to vertically integrate the entire food production, processing and distribution into a mega-industry, globalized.
[00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:45.091]  First in the United States and then globalized in the last 15-20 years.
[00:12:46.012 --> 00:12:53.233]  And in doing so, and then adding as the icing on the cake, patented seeds, GMO seeds.
[00:12:53.753 --> 00:12:56.774]  In a few years there'll be seeds secretly filled with Terminator.
[00:12:58.171 --> 00:13:00.992]  Ostensibly to protect patent rights of Monsanto et al.
[00:13:03.113 --> 00:13:08.994]  They will have control and they will be able, in a military sense, to exercise strategic denial.
[00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:24.979]  If a country like Iraq or Iran or Zimbabwe or any other priority hate object of a particular Washington government, God forbid that we would ever have a government which doesn't exercise reason and justice in Washington,
[00:13:26.132 --> 00:13:33.719]  But in case that were to happen, and they would simply say, okay, Monsanto, cut off the seed supply of Zimbabwe.
[00:13:34.019 --> 00:13:35.461]  Cut off the seed supply of China.
[00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:38.403]  Cut off the seed supply of Azerbaijan.
[00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:44.649]  And they've been running around, grabbing up, paying ten times what it's worth, in one case I saw, for heirloom seed companies.
[00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:52.336]  They've bought up almost all of them, and they hoard the seeds, shut them off, no longer sell them, let those seed lines die in the public.
[00:13:52.976 --> 00:13:55.198]  Well, Iraq is a particularly strategic area because
[00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:19.030]  Iraq is the ancient biblical Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization.
[00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:24.931]  The valley between the Tigris and Euphrates was the first cultivation of wheat.
[00:14:25.871 --> 00:14:34.313]  And they have more wheat varieties in a seed bank in Iraq before the last war.
[00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.133]  Yeah, not for long.
[00:14:35.693 --> 00:14:38.293]  Yeah, well, the seed bank disappeared.
[00:14:38.353 --> 00:14:40.574]  It happened to be in a place called Abu Ghraib.
[00:14:41.494 --> 00:14:42.914]  Some of your listeners might have heard of that.
[00:14:43.806 --> 00:14:46.349]  And it utterly disappeared off the face of Iraq.
[00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:47.910]  Now a death dungeon, yes.
[00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.991]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:49.191 --> 00:14:52.114]  So that's the kind of thing.
[00:14:52.174 --> 00:14:59.501]  And then you have Bill Gates Foundation and Rockefeller and Monsanto building the Doomsday Seed Vault.
[00:15:00.154 --> 00:15:09.121]  impermeable to nuclear attack or any other kind of natural or man-made disaster up there in the North Sea in the North Pole.
[00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:09.942]  They know what they're doing.
[00:15:10.742 --> 00:15:26.694]  In fact, a Monsanto executive, what, nine years ago, was actually even in the big Eugenics publication, the front National Geographic, but they even admitted there they had the quote to paraphrase, well we're just going to infect everything with our genetics and then use courts to basically take over those companies.
[00:15:26.934 --> 00:15:27.735]  And that's what they do.
[00:15:27.795 --> 00:15:28.716]  They infect you
[00:15:29.176 --> 00:15:29.357]  Yep, yep.
[00:15:38.877 --> 00:15:39.317]  Control.
[00:15:39.477 --> 00:15:40.998]  It's about total control.
[00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:46.562]  Full spectrum dominance is the military side of it, the next book that I'm publishing.
[00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:51.105]  But the control over the food, you control the people, as Kissinger said.
[00:15:51.125 --> 00:15:57.109]  Well, I want you to hit the key points, but right now, Global Research, great folks, Michelle Chosodosky, they published your book.
[00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.570]  By the way, I want to carry it.
[00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.592]  I just got so busy, I haven't bought it in bulk from them.
[00:16:00.612 --> 00:16:02.833]  I haven't read it yet, but I'm sure it's excellent.
[00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:03.494]  I carry some other
[00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:09.356]  Well, I think your readers would find it more than worthwhile, and I would be very happy to have you.
[00:16:09.536 --> 00:16:17.858]  Well, we do carry some books on GMO by some other great scholars, but this guy's dead on, great researcher, but he's good on the full spectrum, speaking of that term.
[00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:24.440]  Other guys we have on seem to be specialists, you seem to be somewhat of a generalist, but also with a lot of detailed knowledge in each area, that's what I do.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.201]  But yeah, give out the phone number, give out the website, tell folks about the book.
[00:16:28.872 --> 00:16:29.172]  Okay.
[00:16:29.673 --> 00:16:36.238]  The book is available through Global Research, www.globalresearch.ca for Canada.
[00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:46.326]  The book is called Seeds of Destruction, The Hidden Agenda of Genetic Manipulation, F. William Engdahl, and it's available.
[00:16:46.766 --> 00:16:51.230]  I don't have the current price in mind, but if you go direct to the publisher, the
[00:16:52.546 --> 00:17:00.327]  Published USA price is $24.95 and if you go direct to the publisher you get this, I believe, a discount on that.
[00:17:00.568 --> 00:17:02.728]  Now, do you have a personal site or you just write for them?
[00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:04.228]  No, no, no, no.
[00:17:04.348 --> 00:17:05.468]  I have a personal site.
[00:17:05.528 --> 00:17:07.189]  I write worldwide.
[00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:13.530]  My writings are picked up in... Yeah, give out the site because I see so many sites with you on it I'm not sure which one to plug.
[00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:19.151]  My personal site, which is a compilation of all languages of my
[00:17:20.201 --> 00:17:31.386]  Uh, writings and so forth is www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics, one word, .net.
[00:17:31.487 --> 00:17:33.007]  That's right, we plugged that last week.
[00:17:33.528 --> 00:17:35.689]  And we'll put that up on screen for folks.
[00:17:35.729 --> 00:17:36.749]  Give that out one more time.
[00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:40.211]  Okay, www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net.
[00:17:49.933 --> 00:17:56.960]  Okay, I'm going to skip this break for the Infowars.com stream listeners and PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.983]  Everybody else will be back in three minutes, but I can't waste any time on this subject.
[00:18:00.023 --> 00:18:00.604]  It's so important.
[00:18:00.964 --> 00:18:07.170]  When we come back, though, we're going to talk about the fact that we won a major victory.
[00:18:07.251 --> 00:18:08.452]  We can defeat these people.
[00:18:09.795 --> 00:18:11.876]  But then they came in with a counter-strike.
[00:18:12.457 --> 00:18:13.718]  So that's the moral of the story.
[00:18:13.758 --> 00:18:15.099]  The fight goes on.
[00:18:15.159 --> 00:18:16.219]  It's the long march.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.001]  It's the going the distance that matters.
[00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:19.922]  Stay with us.
[00:18:23.211 --> 00:18:28.016]  Okay, William, I'm going to go back to him, John.
[00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:29.197]  I'm going to go back to him.
[00:18:29.217 --> 00:18:30.158]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:32.560]  William, this is so important.
[00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:33.922]  If you can't do it, it's fine.
[00:18:34.562 --> 00:18:42.871]  I want to move Bob Chapman, when he calls in 10 minutes, back about 15, because I want to finish this up, and I've been adding a lot, but I know he's got more he wants to add.
[00:18:44.512 --> 00:18:50.320]  Okay, we can go to a few minutes after the hour if that's okay.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.842]  I know your back gets to you.
[00:18:52.623 --> 00:18:53.524]  How far do you want to go?
[00:18:54.765 --> 00:18:56.468]  Five minutes after the hour will be fine.
[00:18:56.608 --> 00:19:01.034]  Okay, and then we'll do, in a few weeks when your book comes out, the full spectrum dominance discussion.
[00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.211]  That'd be excellent.
[00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:04.413]  Okay, well when Chapman calls, just tell him to stay on hold then.
[00:19:04.994 --> 00:19:06.595]  Okay, that's fantastic.
[00:19:07.476 --> 00:19:10.299]  And I really appreciate your scholarly work and your research.
[00:19:10.879 --> 00:19:13.682]  I look forward to... Do you ever come to the United States?
[00:19:14.965 --> 00:19:15.706]  Uh, seldom.
[00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:20.389]  It's a physically exhausting trip and I seldom get there.
[00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:21.230]  I understand.
[00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:35.061]  I would like to, maybe we'll pay for a satellite uplink and do it, I would like to interview you for another, I'm going to make a, you haven't seen my film Endgame, I'm going to make a similar film, it won't be Endgame, about all this and it'll reach millions of people.
[00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:40.425]  I would like to interview you and others for that film coming up in the next year.
[00:19:42.921 --> 00:19:44.482]  Okay.
[00:19:44.522 --> 00:19:46.263]  I'm sure we can find some electronic.
[00:19:46.363 --> 00:19:52.587]  I do it with the Russian TV, with Chinese media, all sorts of places all over the world.
[00:19:52.607 --> 00:19:54.549]  So I'm sure we can figure out something.
[00:19:54.729 --> 00:19:55.269]  Absolutely.
[00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:58.671]  I'll get you in the chair over there, and we'll do that interview that way.
[00:19:59.572 --> 00:20:00.953]  That's absolutely fabulous.
[00:20:01.113 --> 00:20:03.614]  Yeah, I've got a couple of satellite uplink places right down the street.
[00:20:03.654 --> 00:20:10.159]  I was just in one for press TV for an hour yesterday, and I do Russia Today as well.
[00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:13.198]  And, in fact, that's where we learned about you.
[00:20:13.218 --> 00:20:15.340]  I'd seen your articles, but I hadn't put two and two together.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.722]  When I saw you on Russia Today, that was good.
[00:20:18.662 --> 00:20:19.523]  Russia Today?
[00:20:19.763 --> 00:20:21.264]  Oh, Johnson's?
[00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:23.586]  Well, you may not have.
[00:20:23.646 --> 00:20:25.807]  It was a phone interview, but you were on Russia Today.
[00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:26.648]  I saw it.
[00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:27.248]  Okay.
[00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:29.630]  No, I did a phone interview with Real News, I think it was.
[00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:32.457]  On Georgia about three or four weeks ago.
[00:20:48.993 --> 00:20:51.795]  Getting key points here for the listeners.
[00:20:52.215 --> 00:20:53.395]  Are you enjoying the radio interview?
[00:20:53.916 --> 00:20:54.416]  Oh, very much.
[00:20:54.736 --> 00:20:55.016]  Very much.
[00:20:55.036 --> 00:20:56.177]  Well, we really appreciate you.
[00:20:56.737 --> 00:21:02.000]  It's so hard to grasp how big and evil this is, just how real it is.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:02.921]  It's so diabolical.
[00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:08.063]  It's like a comic book or something, what the evil mastermind comes up with.
[00:21:08.324 --> 00:21:08.824]  Okay, here we go.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.121]  I hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security.
[00:21:13.221 --> 00:21:14.681]  Call eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:16.701]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:21:17.361 --> 00:21:18.522]  Or 1-800-409-5633.
[00:21:18.782 --> 00:21:21.582]  That's 1-800-409-5633.
[00:21:21.662 --> 00:21:22.202]  Call them today.
[00:21:22.222 --> 00:21:23.023]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:21:25.923 --> 00:21:28.064]  The American people are the guinea pigs.
[00:21:28.284 --> 00:21:29.224]  It's all tested here.
[00:21:29.244 --> 00:21:33.825]  The fluoridation of water, the mercury in vaccines, the sterilization.
[00:21:35.785 --> 00:21:37.225]  The Rockefellers really got their power.
[00:21:37.245 --> 00:21:39.686]  30 plus states had forced sterilization laws.
[00:21:41.243 --> 00:21:42.984]  They carry out their eugenics operations.
[00:21:43.024 --> 00:21:44.986]  They founded the Human Genome Project.
[00:21:45.286 --> 00:21:47.908]  They're head scientists saying blacks weren't human a few months ago.
[00:21:48.248 --> 00:21:49.729]  Had to step down Dr. Watson.
[00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.170]  This is what they're up to.
[00:21:53.071 --> 00:21:54.052]  And they're playing God.
[00:21:54.372 --> 00:21:55.373]  And they are intelligent.
[00:21:55.713 --> 00:21:56.694]  They do have a lot of foresight.
[00:21:56.734 --> 00:22:03.598]  But when the people said no to human growth hormone in the milk, they just passed laws where you basically can't label it.
[00:22:04.019 --> 00:22:09.122]  Or when the people said we want organic food and started buying it, they just passed a law saying it can be 75%
[00:22:11.158 --> 00:22:11.518]  Yes, we are.
[00:22:28.288 --> 00:22:30.469]  Illegally planting in places like Brazil.
[00:22:30.509 --> 00:22:31.749]  I mean, they want to get it in.
[00:22:32.069 --> 00:22:33.149]  They want to infest.
[00:22:33.589 --> 00:22:43.852]  They come in and plant their seeds, and they've caught retired Royal Mounted Police literally throwing GMO seeds into the gutters by fields.
[00:22:44.292 --> 00:22:46.312]  I mean, this is bio-warfare.
[00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:50.373]  Three minutes left in this segment, then five in the next.
[00:22:50.393 --> 00:22:51.914]  You've got to leave us, Bob Chapman, coming up.
[00:22:52.214 --> 00:22:52.974]  You've got the floor.
[00:22:52.994 --> 00:22:53.714]  I'm going to shut up.
[00:22:53.794 --> 00:22:54.674]  I've brought in my points.
[00:22:55.015 --> 00:22:56.455]  Other key areas we haven't covered.
[00:22:58.089 --> 00:23:05.593]  Well, to go back to this project from the 1950s, to give readers an idea, this project is very concrete.
[00:23:05.693 --> 00:23:10.635]  You know, if you think of some vast abstract conspiracy, then you feel hopeless and overwhelmed.
[00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:13.277]  But it's very concrete, and I think that's important.
[00:23:13.297 --> 00:23:23.762]  That's what I try to do in all of my books, to give people a sense of the actual concrete individuals who are doing this, the actual concrete institutions, and so forth.
[00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:28.883]  And this agribusiness project I think is absolutely essential to understand.
[00:23:29.404 --> 00:23:40.349]  You go into a supermarket today because of modern advertising, most American shoppers think food is grown in a supermarket at the Giant or Walmart or what will you.
[00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:44.957]  And this is a product of something called agribusiness.
[00:23:44.977 --> 00:23:49.080]  You no longer have the possibility to go to a farmer's market in most parts of the country.
[00:23:50.861 --> 00:23:57.185]  Similar thing in Europe, although you do still have institutions in France, Germany, and elsewhere of these weekly farmer's markets.
[00:23:57.425 --> 00:23:58.466]  Thank goodness.
[00:23:58.506 --> 00:24:06.371]  But more and more of those are getting agribusiness tomatoes from Holland or South Africa or whatever.
[00:24:08.886 --> 00:24:15.551]  The vertical integration of the food chain in the hands of three or four giant multinational companies.
[00:24:16.152 --> 00:24:20.575]  The grain trade is in the hands of essentially three giant corporations.
[00:24:20.675 --> 00:24:25.299]  One of them, Cargill Corporation, is a private family-held corporation.
[00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:35.086]  The former chairman of it, Whitney McMillan, was a Skull and Bones member along with the Bush father and son at Yale University.
[00:24:36.997 --> 00:24:39.379]  They have more power than most governments.
[00:24:39.459 --> 00:24:51.389]  They determine the power, and this I documented in on-the-spot research talking to principals involved at the European Commission in Brussels and Belgium back in the 1980s.
[00:24:52.089 --> 00:24:55.832]  They determine European Union grain policies.
[00:24:56.613 --> 00:25:06.141]  They were the ones who determined that the grain mountains would be eliminated in Europe and also in the United States just in time for their policy of
[00:25:07.288 --> 00:25:33.460]  uh... biofuels uh... burning corn burning different uh... crops like uh... canola rapeseed uh... as is automobile fuel instead of using it for the for the human food chain of the animal food chain and what is that done in the last three years since two thousand five in the bush administration provided these huge incentives for biofuels to farmers uh... half of the corn crop of the united states of america is burned for
[00:25:35.153 --> 00:25:36.053]  For transport fuels.
[00:25:36.394 --> 00:25:37.574]  It's absolutely criminal.
[00:25:38.114 --> 00:25:45.196]  So this is the kind of thing that they're playing around with this agribusiness, this cartelization, monopolization of the food chain.
[00:25:45.236 --> 00:25:49.077]  And that is a highly unhealthy process for the human species.
[00:25:49.097 --> 00:25:49.817]  All right, got a break.
[00:25:49.897 --> 00:25:50.477]  One minute break.
[00:25:50.517 --> 00:25:58.439]  Final segment with F. William, our guest, just an amazing researcher, F. William Engdahl.
[00:25:59.019 --> 00:25:59.999]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:01.140]  Stay with us.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.180]  This is warfare.
[00:26:05.025 --> 00:26:07.506]  I'm going to skip this one minute break, too.
[00:26:09.546 --> 00:26:14.628]  Yeah, for the internet listeners, William, we're skipping this little break right now.
[00:26:15.248 --> 00:26:17.028]  This thing goes up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:26:17.148 --> 00:26:18.029]  They're watching live.
[00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:21.730]  They're listening live, and it's magnified as it spills out onto all the web channels.
[00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:29.192]  And it's important, viewers, to not just put this up on YouTube and Google, but other tracks, because we've got YouTube and Google erasing a lot of our stuff.
[00:26:29.432 --> 00:26:29.992]  Hit them there.
[00:26:30.052 --> 00:26:31.012]  That's where it goes viral.
[00:26:31.312 --> 00:26:33.093]  But hit the enemy at every other point.
[00:26:34.424 --> 00:26:56.980]  Let's come back and wrap this up for folks, the fact that this really is a military operation, as you said, and kind of go back to the beginning, back to the start, so we can recap the fact that the eugenicists, as you document in your book and your research, started all of this, and any other points you want to make in the final five minutes we have, okay?
[00:26:57.821 --> 00:27:00.743]  Well, Alex, I'd like to make one very crucial point.
[00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:03.485]  A lot of people are of the impression
[00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:08.237]  That this is all a question of corporate greed.
[00:27:08.317 --> 00:27:12.478]  Monsanto has corporate greed, Sengenta, Dow, DuPont, and so forth.
[00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:14.939]  It's not corporate greed.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.061]  They wouldn't have taken such a high risk.
[00:27:18.221 --> 00:27:18.841]  It's eugenics.
[00:27:18.921 --> 00:27:19.681]  It's their religion.
[00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:20.602]  They want to kill everybody.
[00:27:20.642 --> 00:27:21.002]  Stay there.
[00:27:21.802 --> 00:27:22.382]  Come in and tell them.
[00:27:22.843 --> 00:27:25.444]  See, I've never read your book, but I know the answer because they say they're going to kill us.
[00:27:25.464 --> 00:27:25.764]  Here we go.
[00:27:30.939 --> 00:27:38.142]  Now into the fourth and final hour, we've got Bob Chapman, international forecaster, coming in on the economic news, 9-11 info.
[00:27:38.862 --> 00:27:43.764]  Last five minutes with F. William Engdahl, researcher, author.
[00:27:46.121 --> 00:27:51.124]  In the final equation, as you talk about in your book, this is not being done for greed.
[00:27:51.144 --> 00:27:52.825]  It's not being done for even power.
[00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:53.946]  It is their religion.
[00:27:54.526 --> 00:27:57.948]  They believe exterminating the vast majority of the population is the goal.
[00:27:57.988 --> 00:28:02.190]  So, give us, lay it out, and it's in their own words.
[00:28:02.571 --> 00:28:04.091]  What is this really all about?
[00:28:04.131 --> 00:28:09.535]  Well, it's about supremacy, and the ultimate form of supremacy is genocide.
[00:28:09.935 --> 00:28:11.195]  Sir, you've got four minutes.
[00:28:14.556 --> 00:28:23.243]  I went through four years of university with some of the scions of these families, the Rockefellers, the Firestones, the DuPonts, and so forth.
[00:28:24.123 --> 00:28:28.186]  They are not charming people on a one-on-one basis.
[00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:36.653]  I would maintain that they are, in a clinical, classical, psychoanalytical sense, highly paranoid people.
[00:28:37.785 --> 00:28:48.610]  Terrified that the masses, as they see it, the hordes out there, are going to steal everything they've grabbed and accumulated over the decades.
[00:28:49.251 --> 00:28:52.172]  And therefore, I think they've gone to these lengths.
[00:28:53.073 --> 00:28:59.076]  It's a perversion that's taken on a life of its own, but it's literally, at this point,
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.144]  To the point where if we don't roll this back in some way or another it may already be too late in terms of GMO.
[00:29:07.504 --> 00:29:08.886]  The genie may be out of the bottle.
[00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:12.268]  Some serious scientists think that that may be the case.
[00:29:12.989 --> 00:29:20.034]  I think not so long as in Western Europe there is massive resistance on the grassroots level against GMO.
[00:29:20.054 --> 00:29:24.777]  The governments have not been able to satisfy Monsanto and the other
[00:29:26.342 --> 00:29:31.866]  Gene Giants in terms of promoting this in Europe because there's too much backlash against it.
[00:29:32.647 --> 00:29:39.232]  They have had extreme difficulties in Asia, in China, in Africa and so forth.
[00:29:39.852 --> 00:29:47.018]  And so it hasn't, they haven't gotten, they tried to pull something off at the Rome Food Summit in June.
[00:29:47.738 --> 00:29:51.121]  They made an extra effort to play up the
[00:29:52.322 --> 00:29:52.822]  I think so.
[00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:16.438]  In the hopes that he would give a papal blessing to GMO as a solution to the world hunger crisis.
[00:30:16.498 --> 00:30:17.299]  And he didn't, did he?
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.501]  He didn't do it.
[00:30:18.681 --> 00:30:29.573]  I won't go through all the details as it was told to me by people in Rome who are highly informed, but thank the Lord that he didn't do it, but that just shows you that this
[00:30:30.473 --> 00:30:33.236]  And suddenly the theme of world hunger disappeared from the agenda.
[00:30:33.256 --> 00:30:36.038]  Their operation didn't succeed.
[00:30:36.218 --> 00:30:41.123]  Let's point out that even within the eugenicists, some of them don't like it, like Prince Philip and Prince Charles.
[00:30:41.163 --> 00:30:41.744]  They're evil.
[00:30:42.044 --> 00:30:44.766]  They want to exterminate people, and we have their names on those documents.
[00:30:45.247 --> 00:30:45.887]  They've stated it.
[00:30:46.088 --> 00:30:48.330]  But they're like, don't do it this way, and they're right.
[00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.412]  I mean, this endangers everything.
[00:30:50.872 --> 00:30:52.714]  And I also want to add, it's not just the elites.
[00:30:53.254 --> 00:31:10.726]  You've got, like in Blade Runner, little shops in Hong Kong and in South Korea, as you know, where they're privately, little families, little companies, are splicing rhesus monkeys with jellyfish that glow in the dark, and that causes all sorts of viral releases from DNA, bacterial mutations.
[00:31:10.746 --> 00:31:12.127]  We've had a lot of scientists on about that.
[00:31:12.427 --> 00:31:17.551]  So there's also all these other crazy rogues out, literally playing with Shiva.
[00:31:17.971 --> 00:31:20.132]  I mean, literally playing with Kali.
[00:31:20.172 --> 00:31:22.194]  I mean, this is opening the gates of hell.
[00:31:22.754 --> 00:31:23.475]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:24.615 --> 00:31:28.798]  Well, maybe the human race isn't fit to survive.
[00:31:28.878 --> 00:31:29.579]  I'm an optimist.
[00:31:29.619 --> 00:31:30.179]  I think we are.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.560]  No, I agree with you.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.181]  I wrote the book.
[00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:36.844]  Well, I mean, I'm not calling for crises, but there have already been a lot of crises with this stuff and a lot of big problems.
[00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:38.725]  And we know it's hurting humans.
[00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:49.273]  Just the faster that can come out, the better, so we can really get control of this and then have heavily transparent research and maybe even have some GMO.
[00:31:49.613 --> 00:31:50.393]  But it's got to be
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:03.783]  No, I think the methodology of GMO is reductivist in a scientific sense, and utterly flawed.
[00:32:04.164 --> 00:32:08.145]  So, so, so, you believe... The key canon approach is that there's no way that this could be stable.
[00:32:08.672 --> 00:32:11.896]  There may be in the universe of possibilities some way that it can be.
[00:32:11.956 --> 00:32:12.817]  I won't rule that out.
[00:32:13.318 --> 00:32:15.160]  I'm not a biologist.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.141]  It's just too dangerous.
[00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:18.704]  Even if you meant to do good with it, it's too dangerous.
[00:32:18.884 --> 00:32:19.205]  Stay there.
[00:32:19.225 --> 00:32:20.406]  I want to say bye to you right now.
[00:32:20.586 --> 00:32:21.808]  Brimfulwars.com viewers.
[00:32:24.102 --> 00:32:26.844]  Okay, sir, I'm going to have Trey call you.
[00:32:26.924 --> 00:32:34.828]  That professor, Arlipied, I interviewed him twice, then the computer we had and transferred the number got lost, so I never got him back on.
[00:32:35.128 --> 00:32:47.595]  Let me have Trey call you in about ten minutes, let you have a break, and can you give me his email or his phone, he's been on several times, you can just Google that, so I can get him back on, and then I want to have you on in about
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.601]  Two weeks when the book comes out, I want to carry it.
[00:32:50.621 --> 00:32:52.961]  I've read some of the synopsis of Full Spectrum Dominance.
[00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:54.182]  I have a big bookstore online.
[00:32:54.202 --> 00:32:54.722]  Well, big.
[00:32:54.762 --> 00:32:55.922]  It's bigger than Global Research.
[00:32:55.942 --> 00:32:57.763]  They're great folks.
[00:32:57.823 --> 00:33:00.344]  Or is Global Research publishing your new Full Spectrum Dominance?
[00:33:00.864 --> 00:33:01.704]  I'm self-publishing.
[00:33:03.085 --> 00:33:04.125]  Are you using a self-publisher?
[00:33:04.145 --> 00:33:05.346]  Are you having a bunch of them printed up?
[00:33:06.066 --> 00:33:07.706]  No, I'm using a self-publisher.
[00:33:08.687 --> 00:33:11.748]  Okay, well, maybe off-air I'll talk to you about carrying some of your stuff?
[00:33:12.796 --> 00:33:13.936]  Well, we can talk about it.
[00:33:13.976 --> 00:33:19.198]  I'm open, but it's got to be on at least as good terms as I can do by... I'm not even worried about all that, man.
[00:33:19.218 --> 00:33:20.339]  That's why I got you on, plugging it.
[00:33:20.639 --> 00:33:21.339]  Somebody to buy it.
[00:33:22.019 --> 00:33:22.299]  Very good.
[00:33:22.539 --> 00:33:27.441]  It's just, if I sell it on my website, I'll sell 20 times as much as you ever will with me plugging global research.
[00:33:27.901 --> 00:33:30.262]  Because what happens is, that's what I do every day.
[00:33:30.282 --> 00:33:31.702]  I have guests on, and I plug their things.
[00:33:31.722 --> 00:33:32.583]  It's not even about the money.
[00:33:33.663 --> 00:33:36.824]  I do advertising, everything here, just to pay for making my films.
[00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:39.885]  They lose money, but tens of millions watch them on the web.
[00:33:39.925 --> 00:33:41.306]  It's all mission-oriented.
[00:33:41.846 --> 00:33:42.106]  Okay.
[00:33:42.626 --> 00:33:45.507]  Because my children have no future if we don't do that.
[00:33:46.007 --> 00:33:53.328]  So I'm just saying, yeah, no, I mean, I would, but I'm saying if you sell published like on some on-demand thing, or are you printing up a bunch yourself?
[00:33:53.808 --> 00:33:56.229]  No, it's Books On Demand, Lightning Source.
[00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:04.790]  Then I know that's cost prohibitive for you to even be able to sell them to me in bulk, because they charge you so much.
[00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:08.611]  You want to look at... Have your guy get to me on
[00:34:09.952 --> 00:34:11.913]  Some of the terms and maybe we can work something out.
[00:34:11.953 --> 00:34:12.753]  I'm totally open.
[00:34:12.793 --> 00:34:19.177]  I'm fed up with publishers who cheat and leave me with nothing at the end of the day and don't promote the book.
[00:34:19.317 --> 00:34:19.777]  Oh no, no, no.
[00:34:19.817 --> 00:34:29.522]  You'd do much better to say have three or four thousand printed yourself and then sell them to wholesalers like myself, like Global Research, and with ten contacts like that.
[00:34:29.802 --> 00:34:31.003]  I just want your book to get out.
[00:34:31.483 --> 00:34:32.865]  I just want what you're doing to get out.
[00:34:33.826 --> 00:34:36.209]  And again, this show has total transparency.
[00:34:36.229 --> 00:34:38.632]  We're even on air right now, just for the internet.
[00:34:39.092 --> 00:34:41.696]  Before we leave, give out your website one more time.
[00:34:42.316 --> 00:34:42.637]  Okay.
[00:34:43.258 --> 00:34:50.787]  It's www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.com.
[00:34:53.898 --> 00:35:04.462]  Okay, well, listen, we'll get you up for a couple hours on Full Spectrum Dominance in a few weeks, and I want to have you back on for maybe an hour sometime in a few months about those elitists you went to school with.
[00:35:04.482 --> 00:35:09.563]  We've had other people on, academics who've been in school with them, to describe the evil I've had their roommates on and things.
[00:35:09.924 --> 00:35:10.904]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:35:11.524 --> 00:35:12.584]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[00:35:12.725 --> 00:35:13.625]  I enjoyed it very much.
[00:35:13.685 --> 00:35:14.205]  I enjoyed you.
[00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:14.745]  God bless you.
[00:35:14.925 --> 00:35:16.526]  Okay, do we have Bob Chapman?
[00:35:18.217 --> 00:35:18.637]  Yes, we do.
[00:35:18.678 --> 00:35:19.879]  I just have to transfer him over.
[00:35:19.919 --> 00:35:20.359]  He is ready.
[00:35:20.439 --> 00:35:21.020]  Well done.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.501]  Thank you.
[00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:23.843]  Oh, and for all the viewers out there, all my films are free online.
[00:35:24.264 --> 00:35:25.265]  That's what it's all about.
[00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:26.506]  Defeating the globalists.
[00:35:26.546 --> 00:35:28.188]  And only you can stop them.
[00:35:28.268 --> 00:35:32.413]  You can put the films out en masse to everybody on your email list, and we can defeat them.
[00:35:32.773 --> 00:35:33.073]  All of us.
[00:35:33.113 --> 00:35:35.736]  It's that attitude of victory, knowing we're going to have it!
[00:35:35.956 --> 00:35:37.058]  Let's go live!
[00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:51.060]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.001]  In the next 51 minutes, we are joined by Bob Chapman.
[00:35:54.541 --> 00:36:02.863]  Now, coming up at the bottom of the hour in 20 minutes, we'll open the phones up for 9-11 Truth, economic questions, anything you want to discuss, but so much has been happening.
[00:36:03.243 --> 00:36:08.224]  Unbelievable discussion we just had with F. William Indahl in the last hour.
[00:36:09.104 --> 00:36:11.845]  But Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:14.104]  All the things that are developing.
[00:36:14.284 --> 00:36:15.165]  What does this mean?
[00:36:15.565 --> 00:36:16.945]  Having the Treasury take it over.
[00:36:17.526 --> 00:36:18.986]  Bailing out the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:21.247 --> 00:36:23.227]  Again, a massive consolidation happening.
[00:36:24.168 --> 00:36:26.468]  You're going to pay taxes on all of this.
[00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:28.849]  With all these foreigners buying our debt.
[00:36:28.889 --> 00:36:36.151]  I mean, but talking to an economist, former military intelligence, has had the biggest newsletter in the world until he retired.
[00:36:36.191 --> 00:36:37.192]  Now it's one of the biggest again.
[00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.291]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:36:40.391 --> 00:36:43.233]  Also, he and Gary Allen were partners.
[00:36:43.713 --> 00:36:47.396]  That woke me up when I was a teenager reading None Dare Call Conspiracy.
[00:36:47.436 --> 00:36:54.741]  I'd already heard it all in history and read it, but it really brought it home, the big picture, how they control the left and right, the communists and the fascists, the socialists.
[00:36:54.761 --> 00:37:00.265]  So he's just an amazing person, and we're glad we can have him on to pop in this week and spend time with us.
[00:37:00.645 --> 00:37:03.307]  Bob Chapman, it is good to have you here.
[00:37:03.347 --> 00:37:07.069]  But since it's 9-11, first give us your take on the 9-11 cover-up.
[00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:24.018]  It seems as collapsing with all these big names coming out and saying an investigation is an inside job, could be an inside job, the biggest comedian in France, friends with Sarkozy, congressman, more congressman coming out, a guy with millions and millions of followers,
[00:37:25.413 --> 00:37:28.715]  Of course, Ralph Nader on earlier saying, yes, our government stages terror attacks.
[00:37:29.676 --> 00:37:35.100]  Our people are in New York and all over the country right now handing out free DVDs and pamphlets.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.301]  They're saying everybody's coming up taking the stuff.
[00:37:37.721 --> 00:37:39.583]  Almost everyone believes it's an inside job.
[00:37:39.703 --> 00:37:40.843]  It's exponential.
[00:37:41.124 --> 00:37:42.705]  Your take on that and then the economy.
[00:37:44.586 --> 00:37:47.108]  Well, my take on that is it's about time.
[00:37:48.308 --> 00:37:53.492]  And people are so slow to react as far as 9-11 is concerned.
[00:37:53.956 --> 00:37:55.697]  They like to put it in the back of their mind.
[00:37:56.217 --> 00:38:01.080]  Nobody I knew, so to speak, get killed there or get injured there.
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.941]  And so let the government sort it out.
[00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:19.749]  Well, I believe anybody who saw what happened that day in the collapse, the professionally collapsed building, knew right away that something was dramatically wrong.
[00:38:20.635 --> 00:38:24.736]  And so people are finding out and they're becoming more outspoken about it.
[00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:31.898]  And I think in time there will be finally a real investigation to find out who did what to us.
[00:38:32.898 --> 00:38:34.299]  And that's coming.
[00:38:35.039 --> 00:38:46.302]  And it's because of people like yourself and others who have gone out and gotten tremendous amounts of information on the subject and disseminated it to the public like you are right now.
[00:38:47.042 --> 00:38:47.182]  And
[00:38:48.411 --> 00:38:52.254]  Maybe, after the next election, maybe we can get something done about it.
[00:38:53.355 --> 00:38:55.277]  Well, you just brought up a point there.
[00:38:56.118 --> 00:38:59.841]  It was meant, you know, everything the globalists do is gauge for different strata.
[00:38:59.881 --> 00:39:01.182]  What will intelligentsia think?
[00:39:01.222 --> 00:39:02.243]  What will controllers think?
[00:39:02.643 --> 00:39:05.025]  What will our opposition that's in the know think?
[00:39:05.926 --> 00:39:08.869]  What will kind of the somewhat informed white collar folks think?
[00:39:09.169 --> 00:39:12.732]  What will the dumbed down, you know, beer slurping, football watching?
[00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:13.752]  Not saying you're bad, folks.
[00:39:13.772 --> 00:39:14.333]  We all love it.
[00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:15.533]  Point is, that's your God.
[00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.293]  That's all you know.
[00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:17.114]  You're not versatile.
[00:39:17.694 --> 00:39:18.474]  What will they think?
[00:39:19.055 --> 00:39:22.336]  And clearly, 9-11 was meant to governments to be a threat.
[00:39:22.416 --> 00:39:23.577]  Look how bold we are.
[00:39:24.037 --> 00:39:25.818]  It was also meant to be a threat to us.
[00:39:26.518 --> 00:39:30.540]  And the fact that it was so obvious, I mean, they gauged that.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:33.761]  What was the message they were sending there to the different strata?
[00:39:35.962 --> 00:39:36.742]  You better watch out.
[00:39:36.782 --> 00:39:38.063]  You're going to have a problem.
[00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:44.914]  And that is, you keep your mouth shut and go along with the program, and we won't bother you.
[00:39:45.954 --> 00:39:47.735]  If you don't, you're going to have problems.
[00:39:48.036 --> 00:39:53.239]  And that is through the Patriot Act and other legislation that's been passed.
[00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:59.443]  And for those people who are really outspoken, many of them seem to suicide themselves.
[00:40:00.424 --> 00:40:05.727]  And so I think that was the threat, and I think they did it in Oklahoma City as well.
[00:40:06.502 --> 00:40:13.405]  So it's an open, and then cops spoke out and said the feds did it, and they murdered them and tortured them to death, and then laugh and say it was suicide, cutting them all open.
[00:40:14.105 --> 00:40:18.987]  A cop of the year turns yanky, and others, oh, you saw feds there, well you're just dead, cop of the year, saved all those people.
[00:40:19.367 --> 00:40:21.368]  How about we torture you and find out who else knows what's going on?
[00:40:22.088 --> 00:40:26.530]  And their fellow cops shut their mouths and said, absolutely, murder us whenever you want, we love it, basically.
[00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:31.112]  But some police have expressed, it's just so pathetic to see this going on, but
[00:40:33.553 --> 00:40:34.514]  You're absolutely right.
[00:40:35.054 --> 00:40:40.398]  It is an open threat to everyone, and it is meant to be a threat to those of us that are in the know.
[00:40:41.459 --> 00:40:49.785]  But I think the elites were going according to an old paradigm, an old attack paradigm, an old attack profile, when they had media dominance.
[00:40:50.625 --> 00:40:59.732]  Now they don't, and I really think that they are on the run on many fronts and are not very happy how 9-11 ended up for them.
[00:41:01.493 --> 00:41:02.614]  I think you're absolutely right.
[00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:08.213]  And that has spread, as you say, into other areas.
[00:41:08.253 --> 00:41:12.016]  Their program for the Middle East has been disastrous.
[00:41:13.457 --> 00:41:17.059]  Their economic and financial program is entrapped.
[00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:18.660]  I mean, they can't get out.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:24.204]  There's going to be a day of reckoning, and I know that, and that's why they're frantically running around.
[00:41:25.324 --> 00:41:30.648]  As Mr. Engdahl said, they're afraid they're going to lose their wealth and power.
[00:41:31.454 --> 00:41:40.769]  And Alex is people like you and I who are going to take their wealth and power away from them through our court system by exposing what they're doing.
[00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:43.054]  Well, I mean, they realize that.
[00:41:43.094 --> 00:41:49.156]  That's why they're so dangerous, is they've gone to the point of no return, they've gone for broke, and they know that, and they say that.
[00:41:49.617 --> 00:41:59.660]  Their crimes are so huge that if they don't bring in full-spectrum dominance, if they don't activate COG and totally dominate everybody, then they're openly saying they're cooked.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.121]  So, that's why it's the immovable object
[00:42:03.581 --> 00:42:07.002]  You know, going up against an immovable object, it is a collision.
[00:42:07.422 --> 00:42:15.905]  And if we just don't blink and just say, you know what, ramming speed, and put it in high gear and just pedal to the metal, I mean, there's no way we're going to lose, Bob.
[00:42:17.045 --> 00:42:17.845]  I agree with that.
[00:42:18.566 --> 00:42:21.367]  It's just waiting them out and keeping the information coming.
[00:42:22.327 --> 00:42:32.090]  And I never thought that I would be projected into the spot that I am at my late age, being able to transport
[00:42:32.623 --> 00:42:35.625]  Information and primarily information in the financial world.
[00:42:36.666 --> 00:43:01.564]  There are others who specialize in other areas, just like Mr. Engdahl said earlier, that I'm not an expert in science, and neither am I, but we do what we can do, and it's great that we have someone to work with like yourself, who is able to grasp many subjects and tell the people the real innards of what's going on in them.
[00:43:02.375 --> 00:43:05.778]  Well, Bob, it's just really an honor to have you on as well.
[00:43:05.858 --> 00:43:12.264]  Okay, let's get into the economy, and I'm going to skip this next break coming up for Infowars.com listeners, because, again, the information is so important.
[00:43:12.284 --> 00:43:14.626]  Breakdown, were you expecting this?
[00:43:14.646 --> 00:43:18.449]  Because you and others have been saying you expected them to take it over, but when were you expecting it?
[00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.711]  By that, were you expecting it now?
[00:43:21.312 --> 00:43:23.153]  Because some had said it was coming later.
[00:43:23.173 --> 00:43:28.358]  I don't remember what you said on the show, but you said they were going to take over Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and then what does this mean?
[00:43:28.398 --> 00:43:29.459]  Where is it going in the future?
[00:43:32.987 --> 00:43:33.307]  Bob?
[00:43:34.408 --> 00:43:39.712]  The first announcement by the International Forecaster was just four years ago.
[00:43:41.054 --> 00:43:45.757]  And I said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were technically bankrupt.
[00:43:47.319 --> 00:43:51.342]  And everybody on Wall Street and in the Beltway knew that.
[00:43:52.743 --> 00:44:02.571]  And they needed Fannie and Freddie to execute the real estate bubble, which was going to keep the economy from collapsing
[00:44:02.932 --> 00:44:04.814]  For the next five or six or seven years.
[00:44:05.774 --> 00:44:21.667]  And so, they continue to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take on mortgages, and as time went on over this past four-year period, they took on more speculative mortgages, which made the situation even worse.
[00:44:22.668 --> 00:44:31.696]  The figures, the numbers, the balance sheet in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both were bogus.
[00:44:32.592 --> 00:44:33.772]  That's hard to say at this time.
[00:44:33.792 --> 00:44:36.593]  I just know with what they've got already, they're in serious trouble.
[00:45:02.346 --> 00:45:03.887]  You got your derivatives, go ahead.
[00:45:04.747 --> 00:45:11.770]  Yeah, and the derivatives, they just made terrible mistakes in purchasing and writing them.
[00:45:12.471 --> 00:45:22.675]  And Raines, who was the head of Fannie Mae, who was dismissed, he executed the first part of it.
[00:45:22.715 --> 00:45:27.277]  They were balancing or harmonizing earnings as well.
[00:45:29.843 --> 00:45:37.187]  I knew what they were into as far as the mortgages was concerned, and I knew their position was financially irretrievable.
[00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:46.993]  I never really thought it would get as bad as it has now, and they have $5.2 trillion worth of mortgages.
[00:45:48.034 --> 00:45:55.159]  They will probably have, I would say a conservative estimate would be about 35% will
[00:45:57.822 --> 00:45:58.883]  Turned out to be bad.
[00:45:59.684 --> 00:46:02.145]  So, you know, we're looking at... Two trillion?
[00:46:03.326 --> 00:46:04.808]  Two trillion dollars.
[00:46:06.189 --> 00:46:12.614]  And on top of that, they have allowed the shareholders to lose almost all their money.
[00:46:13.655 --> 00:46:22.021]  They have allowed the preferred holders to probably lose all their money, and a lot of them are banks.
[00:46:22.221 --> 00:46:25.344]  Alright, well, I'm sorry for interrupting, but is it two or three trillion?
[00:46:25.364 --> 00:46:26.765]  Because my math would be two and a half trillion.
[00:46:27.887 --> 00:46:28.568]  Yeah, two and a half.
[00:46:29.168 --> 00:46:30.369]  And that's a good figure.
[00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:31.951]  It could go as high as four.
[00:46:32.531 --> 00:46:36.235]  But I baseline it at two and say it'll be two or more.
[00:46:37.276 --> 00:46:39.198]  And that'll take five, six, seven years.
[00:46:39.318 --> 00:46:40.679]  But how much does that infect?
[00:46:40.699 --> 00:46:42.281]  I mean, that's only two trillion on the mortgages.
[00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:43.422]  And they sold bonds.
[00:46:43.762 --> 00:46:45.083]  They sold those packages.
[00:46:46.124 --> 00:46:48.387]  And I've seen some reports say it's 50 trillion.
[00:46:48.727 --> 00:46:50.228]  Some say it's 25 trillion.
[00:46:50.268 --> 00:46:52.871]  I mean, how big is the domino effect?
[00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:58.063]  The domino effect could be as large as those figures that you've mentioned.
[00:46:58.663 --> 00:47:00.184]  I'm just going for the base facts.
[00:47:00.244 --> 00:47:03.426]  I mean, that's enough to compel anybody to have a spinning headache.
[00:47:04.467 --> 00:47:05.747]  Well, I actually have one right now.
[00:47:05.807 --> 00:47:08.229]  The preferred hold is $36 billion.
[00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:12.771]  I don't see any way the government can't come in.
[00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:14.752]  They've got to come in and bail those people out.
[00:47:15.452 --> 00:47:18.494]  Because if they don't, a whole bunch of banks are going to go under that wouldn't go under.
[00:47:18.514 --> 00:47:20.095]  All right, let's keep talking about it right now.
[00:47:20.115 --> 00:47:21.776]  Here we go with Bob Chapman.
[00:47:23.848 --> 00:47:24.788]  Keep rolling, Bob.
[00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.689]  Keep rolling.
[00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:26.629]  Just keep going.
[00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:40.216]  And also, of $1.3 trillion in round figures of bonds, those bonds, over $800 billion worth are held by foreigners.
[00:47:41.457 --> 00:47:45.339]  And I think that's what brought this thing to a crescendo.
[00:47:45.399 --> 00:47:46.780]  I mean, it had been going on for a long time.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.980]  So you're saying they had to?
[00:47:50.888 --> 00:47:56.094]  You better guarantee those bonds or you've got a serious problem.
[00:47:56.555 --> 00:48:00.059]  Here's the $64 million question, then we'll go back, Bob, and I'll let you roll.
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:06.307]  Here's the $64 million question, and I want to answer this when we come back from break, but right now you can keep going over the Chinese and what you were saying.
[00:48:06.527 --> 00:48:07.368]  But before I forget,
[00:48:08.029 --> 00:48:09.410]  Because I write notes here and then forget.
[00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:21.177]  When we come back, when or if, how long till this eats through, this time bomb, until they see the treasury is insolvent with all the crap they're dumping on it?
[00:48:21.417 --> 00:48:35.246]  Or will it just go on forever and then because it's the government backing it, it won't matter if it's all fraud and then we enter a la-la land where any investment, including birdcage liner, used birdcage liner, is as good as gold.
[00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:41.130]  So, I mean, you see my question, let's answer that in three minutes, but continue answering with the Chinese saying, look, we're holding this.
[00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.551]  Go ahead.
[00:48:43.232 --> 00:48:44.953]  And I think they pushed them into it.
[00:48:45.554 --> 00:48:49.156]  And I don't think that they wanted to do that two months before an election.
[00:48:49.937 --> 00:48:52.159]  And so I don't think they had any other choice.
[00:48:52.219 --> 00:48:54.981]  And I think that was probably the compelling factor.
[00:48:55.841 --> 00:49:04.228]  Another thing is that the Chinese have been, again, buying dollars with yen in order to suppress the value of yen.
[00:49:05.272 --> 00:49:05.632]  Yen.
[00:49:05.732 --> 00:49:06.812]  Yarn, I should say.
[00:49:06.832 --> 00:49:16.275]  And the reason they're doing that is to continue to be competitive, because they're starting to run into some pretty stiff competition offshore.
[00:49:17.135 --> 00:49:24.317]  And, of course, too, their banking system's got problems I won't even go into here, which is as bad as the Japanese had in 1992.
[00:49:25.577 --> 00:49:29.498]  And that's because Communist Party members get loans and never pay them back.
[00:49:30.578 --> 00:49:32.439]  And so China
[00:49:33.266 --> 00:49:35.667]  I was saying, look, you've got to honor these bonds.
[00:49:36.228 --> 00:49:40.130]  And on the other hand, we're going to buy dollars because we want to keep our currency down.
[00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:43.632]  And by doing so, we'll buy treasuries with that money.
[00:49:44.632 --> 00:49:57.119]  And so they were a support mechanism on one side by buying the treasuries, but on the other, they want a protection on their Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds.
[00:49:57.299 --> 00:49:59.820]  And so I think that's what compelled
[00:50:00.822 --> 00:50:05.065]  The Treasury to go forward and meet the challenge, finally.
[00:50:06.446 --> 00:50:07.347]  They didn't want to do it.
[00:50:08.447 --> 00:50:11.490]  How long will this take?
[00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:17.834]  It'll take an absolute minimum of probably three years, and it could go up many years.
[00:50:18.614 --> 00:50:29.942]  And what they're going to try to do is extend the real estate and the mortgage and the securitization of mortgages problem as far out into the future as they can.
[00:50:30.566 --> 00:50:39.328]  So they can deal with other problems like they've got now, where about 50% of brokerage houses and banks are insolvent.
[00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:42.309]  And this is a monstrous problem.
[00:50:42.869 --> 00:50:47.051]  And so by doing what they've done, they're able to throw some of it into the future.
[00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:59.394]  Example, right now, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and you didn't see this anyway because they didn't publish it, they changed
[00:50:59.906 --> 00:51:00.386]  Guarantee.
[00:51:26.055 --> 00:51:28.217]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[00:51:28.617 --> 00:51:29.358]  That's his website.
[00:51:29.398 --> 00:51:35.583]  My websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:51:35.643 --> 00:51:39.446]  Take some calls coming up in the last 15-20 minutes of the hour for Bob Chapman.
[00:51:39.466 --> 00:51:39.926]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:51:39.946 --> 00:51:40.006]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:51:40.046 --> 00:51:44.930]  Jesse in the Netherlands, Paula in Canada, Helen in Florida, Steve in Colorado, Chris in Florida.
[00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.031]  We're going to get to all of you.
[00:51:52.654 --> 00:51:55.956]  And we'll tell you later, before he leaves, how to get a free copy of his newsletter.
[00:51:55.976 --> 00:51:57.617]  This isn't the pap you see on TV.
[00:51:57.657 --> 00:52:01.480]  The stuff he talks about comes true nine times out of ten or more.
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:17.029]  I remember him four or five years ago, I've been interviewing Bob for about eight, nine actually, talking about Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac going under, Catherine Austin Fitts, who worked in the HUD for Clinton, high-level, she was the head of it, saying this like seven years ago on our show.
[00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:18.950]  So they've known what's going on.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.663]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was on with us a few days ago, and this had just happened.
[00:52:26.603 --> 00:52:28.865]  This was Monday, and so he wasn't sure yet.
[00:52:30.166 --> 00:52:38.772]  Now I looked at the news, it is clear that they didn't just guarantee the mortgages, but also the bonds that were sold on those is the way I see it.
[00:52:38.792 --> 00:52:47.197]  I want to ask Bob Chapman about that, but I want him to elaborate on what this will extrapolate out to in the next few years.
[00:52:49.683 --> 00:52:58.501]  Because they can prop up the big investments, the big companies, the big bondholders, the foreign governments, the institutions, and they can keep printing dollars to fill that void.
[00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:08.815]  But the economy's breaking down, there's no credit, things are degenerating fast, and he's saying three years, maybe longer, like Japan's been in a 15-year hardcore recession.
[00:53:09.035 --> 00:53:18.860]  So that's a bunch of questions, but A, are they securing everything tied to the Freddie Mac, I mean Fannie Mae Freddie Mac, are they securing
[00:53:19.941 --> 00:53:26.983]  Well, again, it's to extend and extrapolate, as you said, and I think that what they're going to do, and I don't know if Paul Craig Roberts addressed this,
[00:53:46.534 --> 00:53:58.759]  Yes, they are going to take on their balance sheet at the Treasury, the bad paper that's out there, which is the CDOs, the FISIVs, and the ABSs.
[00:53:59.479 --> 00:54:07.942]  And those are bonds that contain, for those who don't know out there, mortgages which were securitized and made into bonds.
[00:54:08.822 --> 00:54:15.605]  The last one, ABS, is asset-backed securities, and they are packaged with vehicle loans,
[00:54:16.635 --> 00:54:22.059]  Swimming pools, mobile homes, motorcycles, those kind of things.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:32.286]  And all of that stuff on average right now, if you can find a market, is selling somewhere in the vicinity of $0.50 to $0.60 on the dollar.
[00:54:32.946 --> 00:54:35.608]  Some of it's at $0.10 and some of it's at $0.80.
[00:54:36.068 --> 00:54:38.010]  It all depends on what paper you have.
[00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.552]  And so, at 50%, the Treasury eventually
[00:54:44.838 --> 00:54:47.099]  And they're going to be very, very quiet about doing this.
[00:54:47.559 --> 00:54:53.201]  It's going to take this on, these securities on, and they're going to loan against it.
[00:54:53.861 --> 00:54:57.582]  And they won't loan 100% of the value of the security.
[00:54:57.962 --> 00:55:01.984]  They will probably loan something near the market.
[00:55:02.584 --> 00:55:11.127]  And so the American taxpayer is going to end up paying for all of that rotten paper that was issued by
[00:55:12.552 --> 00:55:27.617]  The banks in the United States, the banks are being let off the hook, and that would include the rating companies, S&P, Moody's, Pitch, who lied about the ratings and said they were AAA when they were BBB, which is the difference between a 10 and a 4.
[00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:38.460]  They're going to let the mortgage originators, the appraisers, the salespeople, and the 85% of the people who lied on their applications off the hook.
[00:55:39.744 --> 00:55:41.485]  The Treasury is going to eat it.
[00:55:41.505 --> 00:55:46.309]  The Treasury is you and I. Yeah, the Treasury is you and I. Now, what does it mean?
[00:55:46.369 --> 00:55:49.111]  The huge announcement, as you said, that got almost no attention.
[00:55:49.671 --> 00:55:51.092]  I'm ashamed I haven't mentioned it here.
[00:55:51.253 --> 00:55:51.933]  I didn't see it.
[00:55:52.494 --> 00:55:59.679]  That they've moved from a few months on default on mortgages for individuals, civilians as we're called, to two years.
[00:55:59.759 --> 00:56:00.900]  That is a big break.
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.000]  Exactly.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:05.121]  And, you know, this is the only way that they can do it.
[00:56:05.141 --> 00:56:06.902]  What the institutions have been doing already,
[00:56:31.673 --> 00:56:58.782]  is they've been moving them off balance sheet and they do that they take a package let's say it's worth five billion dollars and the person that they sell it to but it's not really sold because it's a conditional contract and they sell it to another party and the other party pays twenty percent and the entity loans them eighty percent to buy the bad paper
[00:57:00.552 --> 00:57:02.493]  I mean, you talk about Mickey Mouse bookkeeping.
[00:57:02.993 --> 00:57:03.853]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:57:03.913 --> 00:57:12.215]  For people that may have passed over their heads and they weren't paying attention, explain that in detail right now for the InfoWars.com stream listeners.
[00:57:12.235 --> 00:57:12.875]  You've got to go there.
[00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:14.936]  We're on the march.
[00:57:15.416 --> 00:57:16.876]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:57:17.636 --> 00:57:20.017]  Yep, it's Alex Jones, the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:20.317 --> 00:57:21.577]  Okay, Bob, please continue.
[00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:25.398]  It's Alex and Bob.
[00:57:26.258 --> 00:57:28.799]  And Bob owns XYZ Securities.
[00:57:29.497 --> 00:57:34.601]  And Alex is an equity expert that has lots of money.
[00:57:35.622 --> 00:57:42.507]  And I go to Alex and I say, Alex, I've got this $5 billion worth of bonds, which are CDOs.
[00:57:43.447 --> 00:57:45.249]  I want to move them off my balance sheet.
[00:57:46.129 --> 00:57:48.411]  I want to sell them to you on a conditional basis.
[00:57:48.992 --> 00:57:58.258]  You put 20% of the money out, which would be a billion dollars in this case, and we'll loan you the other $4 billion.
[00:57:59.665 --> 00:58:08.892]  For you to take this off our hands, all you have to do is pay us back, and if everything works out well, you'll end up with a nice profit, and we will have these off the books.
[00:58:09.092 --> 00:58:14.035]  So that's just fractional reserve banking again?
[00:58:14.055 --> 00:58:16.357]  Well, it isn't even that.
[00:58:16.477 --> 00:58:22.201]  It is so illegal under FASB rules, it's unbelievable.
[00:58:22.861 --> 00:58:29.046]  And they expect people to stand by and look at them rob us.
[00:58:30.169 --> 00:58:31.530]  And us to stand still for it?
[00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:33.571]  It's incredible.
[00:58:33.671 --> 00:58:40.596]  I mean, nothing like this has ever happened, and everybody in corporate America, Wall Street and government, doesn't say a word.
[00:58:41.144 --> 00:58:43.545]  That the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:58:43.585 --> 00:58:44.165]  No, Bob!
[00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:55.309]  Instead, the ones that made the big bucks, all these new billionaires, they're all literally buying armored compounds in the Caribbean with private security forces, and I've talked to them.
[00:58:55.329 --> 00:59:01.031]  They said they're here in Austin, and they're basically saying it's going to be war on the streets.
[00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:02.572]  They have road-warriored us.
[00:59:02.632 --> 00:59:04.653]  They have robbed us so bad
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.261]  And they are just bastards!
[00:59:07.542 --> 00:59:19.312]  And then they've got these brainwashed, bloodthirsty, macho, right-head cops that'll do whatever they're told, and are convinced that anybody that loves America or freedom is evil, and they're ready to eat our guts and ask for seconds.
[00:59:19.912 --> 00:59:21.754]  God, it's so sick!
[00:59:21.974 --> 00:59:26.598]  They're gonna leave us with a bunch of steroid cops while they fly off with all the money!
[00:59:27.919 --> 00:59:28.920]  And they're all gonna die.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.081]  And they know it.
[00:59:31.121 --> 00:59:32.262]  And a lot of us are, too.
[00:59:33.023 --> 00:59:34.044]  But we're going after them.
[00:59:35.205 --> 00:59:37.670]  There is going to be redemption in this, and they know it.
[00:59:38.592 --> 00:59:41.879]  And they're not going to get to keep their power and money this time.
[00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:45.247]  And this is going to make the fall of the Hanseatic League
[00:59:45.965 --> 00:59:48.806]  And the Lombard system look like child's play.
[00:59:49.206 --> 00:59:49.886]  You think so?
[00:59:50.147 --> 00:59:58.049]  No, they'll just tell the cops that babies are Al-Qaeda and they'll throw them off cliffs, cut their heads off, suck their blood.
[00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.090]  We rape you!
[01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:01.971]  We're criminals!
[01:00:01.991 --> 01:00:02.391]  Here we go.
[01:00:02.411 --> 01:00:03.971]  We're going to go back live right now.
[01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.052]  I'm just so sick of them.
[01:00:05.092 --> 01:00:06.012]  It pisses me off.
[01:00:06.412 --> 01:00:07.633]  Just filth, scum,
[01:00:08.573 --> 01:00:11.094]  Dumb idiots everywhere believing whatever the government says.
[01:00:11.494 --> 01:00:12.875]  You idiots have no idea!
[01:00:13.135 --> 01:00:14.696]  All you people saying, we're making this up?
[01:00:14.916 --> 01:00:15.836]  You're going to find out!
[01:00:16.016 --> 01:00:19.238]  Because of your ignorance and you letting them do this, we're screwed!
[01:00:19.258 --> 01:00:20.118]  Here we go.
[01:00:45.278 --> 01:00:50.446]  Bob, in layman's terms, explain as you were saying behind the scenes for the InfoWars listeners.
[01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:53.491]  Listen to those key screams.
[01:00:56.394 --> 01:00:57.995]  What they've done financially here.
[01:00:58.016 --> 01:01:01.198]  In the past, the banks could loan out ten times for every dollar they had.
[01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:02.059]  That was fiat.
[01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:04.041]  They could buy up the world, dominate with that.
[01:01:04.081 --> 01:01:13.409]  But they decided in the early nineties, go through that for people, to just take all restrictions off and just start making up fake money, fake assets.
[01:01:13.709 --> 01:01:18.954]  They bought up all the key assets with it and they're leaving us the junk
[01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:23.275]  And then militarizing the police as a vanguard to protect them.
[01:01:23.295 --> 01:01:28.257]  They're going to call resisting them or not letting them take your farm or house or kids a crime.
[01:01:28.637 --> 01:01:31.378]  But how do you see this unfolding?
[01:01:31.578 --> 01:01:34.500]  Because they preemptively tried to bring in a police state to block us.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:40.962]  They staged terror attacks to get the cowardly mass to huddle around them and give them support in their evil.
[01:01:41.262 --> 01:01:42.302]  I mean, where is this going?
[01:01:43.963 --> 01:01:45.123]  Well, I think you've described it.
[01:01:45.204 --> 01:01:46.304]  It's going into the streets.
[01:01:47.132 --> 01:01:49.814]  And it can't help but get there.
[01:01:50.575 --> 01:01:54.017]  And how they've done it financially is via the root of derivatives.
[01:01:55.818 --> 01:01:58.780]  A derivative is like a piece of insurance.
[01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:11.669]  And if you own the bond and you're only interested in the yield on the bond and it's 5%, but you don't want to take any risk on the bond itself, whether it'll go up or down, you sell that risk to somebody else.
[01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:13.310]  And if somebody out there
[01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:18.424]  In the derivative market, who will take on that risk to protect you for a price.
[01:02:18.564 --> 01:02:23.965]  And then they pass the Ponzi onto somebody else and even sell that insuring of the instrument.
[01:02:25.025 --> 01:02:25.545]  Exactly.
[01:02:25.645 --> 01:02:27.946]  And it might end up 20 hands later.
[01:02:27.966 --> 01:02:40.909]  So that's just like multi-level marketing, a Ponzi scheme, where you started and get 20 people, they get 100 people, they get 1,000 people, and the upper end screws everybody and leaves, but then leaves all the lower 90% holding the bag.
[01:02:42.409 --> 01:02:42.889]  Exactly.
[01:02:43.422 --> 01:02:44.883]  And that's really how it works.
[01:02:45.343 --> 01:02:46.483]  It is a Ponzi scheme.
[01:02:46.923 --> 01:02:51.065]  And that's how they've been holding this whole system together, really, since 1992.
[01:02:51.585 --> 01:03:03.810]  And, of course, it's become bigger and bigger and bigger, and we have derivatives out in the form of $650 or $700 trillion mind-boggling figures.
[01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:07.291]  And so, yes, they will leave the ship.
[01:03:08.011 --> 01:03:09.752]  They'll all go and hide out.
[01:03:10.251 --> 01:03:13.612]  And they think that that's going to save them, and I've got news for them.
[01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:16.753]  We will find them, and there will be trials for them.
[01:03:17.774 --> 01:03:26.717]  And I think the American people, generally speaking, don't understand anything that's being done to them.
[01:03:27.818 --> 01:03:28.918]  They're confused.
[01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:32.399]  They know something's going on, but they just can't understand it.
[01:03:32.519 --> 01:03:36.461]  And everybody doesn't listen to a program like Alex Jones.
[01:03:38.322 --> 01:03:59.312]  There's a lot of people who just don't know, and it's going to be a revelation to them, because when this all comes down, and it's in the process of doing so presently, you look at the unemployment figures, 14.7% long-term, these are government figures, 10.7% intermediate-term unemployment, and short-term unemployment, 6.1%.
[01:03:59.352 --> 01:04:01.093]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:04:01.857 --> 01:04:11.320]  They'll just stage a terror attack right as it fully implodes and claim the Easter Bunny did it, and these cowards will run up and circle around the government and just sit there shaking.
[01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:14.242]  Now, I don't see that working, but you know they'll try that.
[01:04:14.262 --> 01:04:17.583]  They'll do anything to get the cowards to come up and cuddle up under the black wings.
[01:04:18.263 --> 01:04:21.287]  But these people insult us, write us letters, say we're lying.
[01:04:21.968 --> 01:04:25.452]  You predicted Freddie and the whole Fannie thing.
[01:04:25.493 --> 01:04:26.774]  We predicted everything that's happened.
[01:04:26.794 --> 01:04:28.196]  We've laid out what they were going to do.
[01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:29.698]  We've broken it down.
[01:04:30.078 --> 01:04:31.260]  They're total criminals.
[01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:36.066]  And there's still about 30% of the public that will buy anything they're told.
[01:04:36.827 --> 01:04:42.050]  And I know that they don't matter in history, except they're going to be the enforcers.
[01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:50.135]  They'll do anything they're told by the establishment, including handing their children over, as long as they get to act cool.
[01:04:51.515 --> 01:05:02.402]  And that's why you have to be very careful who you speak to this about, and also very careful about venting your feelings about what's going on.
[01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.663]  Because if that happens,
[01:05:05.293 --> 01:05:11.419]  And we have a situation like what the Stasi had in the old East Germany where everybody was spying on everybody else.
[01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:21.109]  Then people will come and pick you up because they'll tell on you and of course there will be a reward for that as well.
[01:05:21.469 --> 01:05:23.051]  I mean the IRS uses the system.
[01:05:23.522 --> 01:05:26.404]  In the United States now, exactly the same way.
[01:05:26.564 --> 01:05:37.533]  Listen, listen, they're training children in every major public school in the country that we look at, with text messages to turn their parents in and neighbors in, and they're running around getting money.
[01:05:37.873 --> 01:05:44.339]  They want to artificially have a bad economy so they can force this conversion over to the military-industrial complex.
[01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:48.102]  I say speak out like your lives depend on it to block them.
[01:05:48.222 --> 01:05:50.784]  Even where cowed and are quiet, they may win.
[01:05:54.249 --> 01:05:55.009]  You agree with that, Bob?
[01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:56.230]  Mm-hmm.
[01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:57.690]  My daughter's a teacher.
[01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:00.091]  So I know what you're talking about.
[01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:01.031]  It's disgusting.
[01:06:02.011 --> 01:06:04.692]  And, of course, she deviates from the subject.
[01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:05.873]  No, I'm not saying she's disgusting.
[01:06:05.913 --> 01:06:09.454]  I'm saying, how do cops listening... No, no, no, no, I know that.
[01:06:09.474 --> 01:06:15.016]  But I'm saying, how do cops listening think freedom is face-scanning cameras and children spying on their parents?
[01:06:15.396 --> 01:06:16.336]  It isn't, okay?
[01:06:16.676 --> 01:06:17.156]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:06:18.497 --> 01:06:22.898]  Yeah, that is not something that should happen in America, but it is happening.
[01:06:23.607 --> 01:06:25.408]  And it's going to be worse in the future.
[01:06:26.328 --> 01:06:34.993]  If I remember correctly, the United States government hired two or three individuals who are high up in the government in East Germany as advisors.
[01:06:35.053 --> 01:06:36.133]  Yeah, Marcus Wolff.
[01:06:36.453 --> 01:06:41.856]  Marcus Wolff, head of the Stasi, was hired by the... He just died last year, but he helped set up Homeland Security.
[01:06:43.377 --> 01:06:45.398]  Exactly, but there were two other people.
[01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:46.398]  One of them was from Moscow.
[01:06:46.458 --> 01:06:47.139]  Primakov.
[01:06:48.139 --> 01:06:49.120]  Right, that's right.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.301]  And that's where they got the ideas
[01:06:51.969 --> 01:07:03.735]  And how to make them work as far as people spying on one another and putting systems together where people couldn't do much of anything without government knowing.
[01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:08.977]  I mean, these laws for money laundering is an example.
[01:07:09.697 --> 01:07:14.340]  They want to know where everything is going and how you're doing it.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.482]  Somebody I know the other day went in to buy some money orders, and I think
[01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:30.142]  They were for like $4,700, and the man said, well, we can't do that without you signing and giving us a copy of your driver's license and all this.
[01:07:30.622 --> 01:07:32.484]  And the man said to him, look, I know you.
[01:07:33.205 --> 01:07:35.467]  You're going to do it my way, and we don't do it at all.
[01:07:36.328 --> 01:07:38.971]  And so the guy said, OK, we'll do it your way.
[01:07:39.531 --> 01:07:42.735]  But if you don't know the guy that's selling the money orders, you've got a problem.
[01:07:43.598 --> 01:07:44.959]  Well, I mean, it's total surveillance.
[01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:46.439]  It's a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.542]  I see 80-year-old, no exaggeration, men buying beer being carted, and they're swiping it.
[01:07:51.562 --> 01:07:52.502]  That's a database.
[01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.183]  It's already in place.
[01:07:55.824 --> 01:07:56.264]  Bastards.
[01:07:56.284 --> 01:07:57.705]  That's right.
[01:07:58.925 --> 01:08:00.446]  It's interesting that they're doing that.
[01:08:00.566 --> 01:08:01.426]  I didn't know that.
[01:08:03.707 --> 01:08:07.249]  You know, I don't have credit cards, and I haven't had them for years.
[01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:10.016]  But they've become very dangerous things.
[01:08:22.873 --> 01:08:23.314]  We're good to go.
[01:08:38.496 --> 01:08:44.141]  That's how it's all standardized, to get everyone habitualized to showing ID for all purchases.
[01:08:44.461 --> 01:08:47.945]  It starts with coal medicine, then it's beer, cigarettes, now it's everything.
[01:08:48.245 --> 01:08:53.730]  Now major gas chains want you to register with your driver's license before you can use a credit card.
[01:08:57.793 --> 01:09:00.115]  It's a tough place to live nowadays, isn't it Alex?
[01:09:00.196 --> 01:09:00.976]  Oh, it's freedom!
[01:09:01.677 --> 01:09:03.438]  So much of it, but the illegal aliens
[01:09:04.421 --> 01:09:06.582]  What kind of democracy is that?
[01:09:06.802 --> 01:09:12.144]  Well, the Catholic bishops are saying, don't track, don't trace, don't arrest illegal aliens, it's of the devil.
[01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:20.948]  But there's been a thousand deaths on one town across the Texas border, hundreds on this side, bedlam and war, and the cops don't arrest illegals for almost anything.
[01:09:21.248 --> 01:09:21.748]  They admit it.
[01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:29.351]  But the citizens, the book is just thrown at you, and you have no Bill of Rights, and you're more surveilled than East Germany.
[01:09:32.433 --> 01:09:33.233]  That's absolutely true.
[01:09:34.853 --> 01:09:40.836]  And that's why a lot of people are saying, gee, I'm 65 years old and I'm not going to put up with this if they leave the country.
[01:09:43.598 --> 01:09:48.020]  I talked to somebody today who said, you know, I'm thinking of going back to the Ukraine.
[01:09:49.361 --> 01:09:49.801]  Oh, I know.
[01:09:49.861 --> 01:09:52.923]  Greeks, Ukrainians, Poles, Arabs, they're all leaving.
[01:09:53.263 --> 01:09:54.304]  They've been leaving for years.
[01:09:55.104 --> 01:09:57.325]  A lot of Russians said, man, I've seen this before.
[01:09:57.946 --> 01:09:58.906]  I'm an anti-communist.
[01:09:58.966 --> 01:10:00.047]  I'm getting the hell out of here.
[01:10:00.727 --> 01:10:03.149]  Well, you know, another thing I've run into also
[01:10:04.255 --> 01:10:08.999]  I was told yesterday there's a mass exodus of Russians from Israel going back home.
[01:10:09.399 --> 01:10:09.599]  Yeah.
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.061]  No, it's everywhere.
[01:10:12.081 --> 01:10:15.664]  I mean, I don't want to be incinerated if the Zionists start a war.
[01:10:15.804 --> 01:10:18.286]  There have been several articles.
[01:10:18.306 --> 01:10:22.410]  The first one was in the Jerusalem Post, the richest man in Israel leaves.
[01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:30.756]  The top richest ten Jews in Israel in the last six months have left, sold their houses, and moved to London and to Switzerland.
[01:10:31.317 --> 01:10:32.518]  I moved to England and Switzerland.
[01:10:32.998 --> 01:10:33.639]  What does that mean?
[01:10:34.841 --> 01:10:36.582]  That means they want to be out of harm's way.
[01:10:36.622 --> 01:10:39.202]  ...may not be caused by EMF radiation alone.
[01:10:39.462 --> 01:10:45.064]  Computers and TVs release chemicals into the air which are inhaled and accumulate in house... And they probably are.
[01:10:45.084 --> 01:10:52.026]  I mean, you know, they're part and parcel of what our government does, so there's not much difference.
[01:10:52.086 --> 01:10:58.928]  And I don't think no matter who's elected, there'll be much difference in the future as far as the Oval Office is concerned.
[01:10:59.328 --> 01:11:02.009]  Hey, Bob, did you just hear that noise over the line?
[01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:06.247]  If I turn this up, I get a broadcast.
[01:11:06.687 --> 01:11:08.289]  I don't.
[01:11:08.549 --> 01:11:11.052]  Yeah, they're running ads for Raw Air.
[01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:13.034]  Can you guys turn that off for me, please?
[01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:14.596]  I'd really appreciate that.
[01:11:20.373 --> 01:11:22.955]  If they don't get it off the air, we'll send somebody else to them.
[01:11:23.295 --> 01:11:24.096]  That's right.
[01:11:24.156 --> 01:11:24.496]  Whatever.
[01:11:24.516 --> 01:11:25.197]  It doesn't even matter.
[01:11:25.617 --> 01:11:29.060]  One of those off-duty cops with the special uniforms.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:30.341]  Oh, God help us.
[01:11:30.521 --> 01:11:39.808]  You know, there's a lot of cops and a lot of government people and a lot of bureaucrats who think this is all funny and cute and they send me emails and they say, yeah, we're going to get you, we're going to kill you, we're taking over.
[01:11:40.069 --> 01:11:42.610]  And you'll go to their MySpace and they're a cop or they're military.
[01:11:43.731 --> 01:11:44.672]  And they're proud of it.
[01:11:44.712 --> 01:11:46.432]  I mean, a lot of them think this is fun.
[01:11:46.932 --> 01:11:48.153]  They don't know history, do they?
[01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:52.875]  They don't know what they're slated for, both fighting us, but also working for this evil system.
[01:11:53.095 --> 01:11:55.096]  They think it's real cute what they're part of.
[01:11:55.136 --> 01:11:57.057]  It's like a little petty power trip.
[01:11:57.317 --> 01:11:58.577]  We're going to get to do whatever we want.
[01:11:58.597 --> 01:11:59.437]  What do you say to them, Bob?
[01:12:00.918 --> 01:12:03.559]  Well, there's 450 million weapons in the United States.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:12.983]  If we cut the population in half, we probably have about 100 million, perhaps, adult males.
[01:12:13.698 --> 01:12:13.918]  I think?
[01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:38.313]  They cannot win.
[01:12:38.433 --> 01:12:39.333]  It is impossible.
[01:12:39.573 --> 01:12:46.935]  Well, the other big problem is, that's why they have the face scanning cameras and the tracking grids and the smart dust, and they admit that's Northcom dominance.
[01:12:47.256 --> 01:12:51.237]  You know, it's so incredible to read John Warner's Defense Authorization Act or read Northcom plans.
[01:12:51.517 --> 01:12:52.818]  They say we're the enemy.
[01:12:53.178 --> 01:12:55.178]  They say they work for Wall Street.
[01:12:55.418 --> 01:12:59.920]  They say the military brass lists the American people as enemies.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.281]  And I don't think the listeners fully grasp.
[01:13:03.321 --> 01:13:05.602]  I mean, they're not even debating it, Bob.
[01:13:07.879 --> 01:13:08.419]  No, they're not.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:12.961]  And they think they're going to do what they want to do, and it's not going to happen that way.
[01:13:12.981 --> 01:13:20.604]  You know, America is still a sleeping tiger as far as the populace is concerned.
[01:13:21.385 --> 01:13:25.467]  And again, I think they've underestimated them.
[01:13:26.147 --> 01:13:27.948]  And I think they're going to have serious problems.
[01:13:28.108 --> 01:13:28.728]  Terminal ones.
[01:13:29.463 --> 01:13:29.764]  All right.
[01:13:30.204 --> 01:13:31.546]  I'm going to skip the final break.
[01:13:31.586 --> 01:13:35.572]  Ted Anderson wants to talk to you off air, so I'll let you talk to him when the show ends, Bob.
[01:13:35.872 --> 01:13:37.635]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:13:38.516 --> 01:13:40.659]  Again, cops are going to take your grandma's pension.
[01:13:40.679 --> 01:13:42.962]  They're going to take stuff from your family, people you know.
[01:13:43.022 --> 01:13:46.347]  I know you'll strut around at family dinners and kind of go, I don't want to hear about it.
[01:13:46.787 --> 01:13:50.309]  Hey Alex, everything you've done so far is awesome and people around the world are waking up
[01:14:11.641 --> 01:14:36.163]  Since I'm too far away from the United States or any crowded places where I could go and tell people about what's going on and getting them to tune in to your show, I went online and actually today there's an event in Second Life, which is a virtual world, and I visited a digital memorial, a 9-11 memorial, and I had a t-shirt on
[01:14:37.462 --> 01:14:42.927]  And the text on it was investigate 9-11, honor the fallen by relentless pursuit of truth.
[01:14:43.147 --> 01:14:45.349]  Well, I've been here all day and I've seen thousands of avatars pass by.
[01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:03.675]  Well, what then happened was the admin banned me from the LAN because I was wearing that t-shirt and giving those t-shirts away.
[01:15:03.735 --> 01:15:05.436]  See, I want to write an article about this, Bob.
[01:15:05.456 --> 01:15:06.536]  I'm sure you know about this.
[01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:10.137]  There's several virtual realities that tens of millions play in these games.
[01:15:10.197 --> 01:15:10.997]  It's like they're real.
[01:15:11.317 --> 01:15:17.939]  This is how Matrix Insertion, the Pentagon, plans to put us in the pods with this because the Wirehead, that's a new function coming up.
[01:15:17.959 --> 01:15:18.820]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.360]  It's all real.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:30.150]  Yes, so you're there, thousands come by and see your t-shirt at the virtual memorial, they wanted to run an op inside there, and then the admin bans you because you had that shirt.
[01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:31.491]  Outrageous!
[01:15:31.731 --> 01:15:37.998]  We need to invade with the members of that with more shirts right now.
[01:15:38.358 --> 01:15:42.903]  Where is that area where your First Amendment is being violated in virtual reality?
[01:15:44.465 --> 01:15:50.689]  It's named Second Life, and the area name that it's in is actually named World Trade Center.
[01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:58.635]  Okay, so not only is 9-11 Truth banned right around the real World Trade Center, but in Second Life, there right now.
[01:15:58.675 --> 01:16:03.538]  Now, what did this degenerate admin say when they banned you in virtual reality?
[01:16:04.479 --> 01:16:06.660]  Well, I'll translate it to English for you.
[01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.301]  I have it right here in front of me.
[01:16:08.341 --> 01:16:09.642]  My God, this is science fiction.
[01:16:09.682 --> 01:16:12.584]  I mean, we're talking about protesting in virtual reality.
[01:16:12.864 --> 01:16:13.625]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:16:15.489 --> 01:16:17.810]  He says you're really looking for it, huh?
[01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:25.372]  I think it's very nasty of you to act so innocent and then walk around here annoying the people with your conspiracy theories.
[01:16:26.012 --> 01:16:33.954]  I'm going to report you to Lyndon Labs, who runs Second Life, of course, who banned you from my sim, and now you're muted.
[01:16:33.974 --> 01:16:34.334]  Goodbye.
[01:16:36.232 --> 01:16:41.495]  So just like in the real world, the, oh, can't wear your 9-11 inside job shirt.
[01:16:41.715 --> 01:16:44.056]  You can have a pierced nose or a devil tat.
[01:16:44.576 --> 01:16:48.258]  That's okay, but don't actually really be individualistic.
[01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:50.038]  Bob Chapman, what do you think of this?
[01:16:51.739 --> 01:17:02.784]  It's something that I didn't expect and it will progressively get worse and they will pick up more and more people and impound them and get all their information and warn them
[01:17:03.334 --> 01:17:05.835]  If they're picked up again, they won't be hurt from again.
[01:17:06.716 --> 01:17:09.477]  And that's where they're going to go about it, particularly with young people.
[01:17:10.437 --> 01:17:18.201]  Because young people are generally in better physical condition than adults, and young people can become combatants much more easily.
[01:17:18.241 --> 01:17:29.526]  What about the Alexander Schultz and Itza quote about when the Gestapo or the GRU, you know, oh how we burned in the camps wishing that when the secret police came out to grab us we would have met them with hatchets in the doorways.
[01:17:30.788 --> 01:17:33.389]  Well, maybe that will come to that in our country.
[01:17:33.429 --> 01:17:35.749]  Does that ever happen in the virtual reality Sims?
[01:17:35.789 --> 01:17:38.230]  Do people ever go wild there?
[01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:43.312]  Well, yeah, it certainly happens.
[01:17:45.272 --> 01:17:54.575]  And my idea to basically get the people informed was to get more listeners who listen to your show to get on Second Life.
[01:17:54.875 --> 01:17:58.296]  And if I'm allowed to give out my avatar name so that people can find me,
[01:17:59.401 --> 01:18:03.784]  It's 9-11 Truth, and the last name of the Avatar is Sky Power.
[01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:06.086]  9-11 Truth, Sky Power.
[01:18:06.146 --> 01:18:10.789]  Everybody who's in Second Life, and I know you're out there listening, Attack Pattern Delta, go now.
[01:18:10.849 --> 01:18:19.055]  Let's get all the 9-11 information we can in there, and take over right now in that virtual reality area immediately.
[01:18:19.075 --> 01:18:20.396]  We're going to skip this break.
[01:18:20.456 --> 01:18:22.837]  Final segment, better get over to InfoWars.com, folks.
[01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:23.138]  Listen.
[01:18:24.684 --> 01:18:25.545]  All right, thank you.
[01:18:25.685 --> 01:18:30.669]  I want to move through these calls quick, but Jesse in the Netherlands, this is science fiction.
[01:18:30.689 --> 01:18:31.329]  We're in the future.
[01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:40.097]  I mean, we're virtual reality on the web and AM and FM, both old world, new world, and where people are being banned in virtual reality with tens of millions.
[01:18:40.317 --> 01:18:43.099]  How many, I know it's tens of millions now that are in Second Life.
[01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:47.163]  How many are part of Second Life, Jesse?
[01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:50.218]  Um, let's see.
[01:18:50.638 --> 01:18:52.700]  Logged on in the last 60 days are 1,132,474 avatars.
[01:18:52.801 --> 01:18:54.222]  And at this moment there are 60,000 online.
[01:18:54.382 --> 01:18:56.444]  Okay, then there's another one that's bigger than.
[01:18:56.845 --> 01:18:57.465]  What's the other one?
[01:18:57.505 --> 01:18:57.686]  Excuse me?
[01:18:57.706 --> 01:18:59.828]  There's a bunch of other games, aren't there?
[01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:12.018]  I didn't quite get that, Alex.
[01:19:12.098 --> 01:19:13.198]  Well, okay, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:13.258 --> 01:19:16.239]  My point is, there's some other ones that are bigger, some other virtual reality games.
[01:19:16.279 --> 01:19:16.959]  I've seen their numbers.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:19.760]  Okay, let's take another call here.
[01:19:20.601 --> 01:19:22.421]  Let's talk to Paula in Canada.
[01:19:22.441 --> 01:19:23.562]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:19:23.582 --> 01:19:23.902]  Go ahead.
[01:19:23.922 --> 01:19:25.102]  Hi, Alex.
[01:19:25.283 --> 01:19:26.383]  I'm calling from Canada.
[01:19:26.403 --> 01:19:26.443]  Hi.
[01:19:26.623 --> 01:19:29.064]  Me and my three children listened to you with my husband as well.
[01:19:29.324 --> 01:19:29.784]  Welcome.
[01:19:29.824 --> 01:19:37.407]  We've followed you for about 11 years now, and for the Truth911 movement, my husband and I did two websites, and I'm printing t-shirts.
[01:19:37.427 --> 01:19:38.468]  We've given out about 500 DVDs.
[01:19:39.878 --> 01:19:47.965]  to expose the government, basically because I want to deprogram my family, my friends, my parents, everybody that I've been around in my life.
[01:19:48.686 --> 01:20:00.156]  I've dropped my feminist career, turned my back as a Canadian athlete, I've turned my back as a police officer, I've turned my back as a model, I've turned my back on everything, basically.
[01:20:00.757 --> 01:20:02.398]  I can't do it anymore, Alex.
[01:20:02.438 --> 01:20:03.319]  I've done it for years.
[01:20:03.857 --> 01:20:05.978]  I'd rather be a mother and a motivational speaker.
[01:20:05.998 --> 01:20:10.081]  I did my first movie in 1998, Reluctant Angel, in Toronto.
[01:20:10.781 --> 01:20:16.405]  And as I did that, about three years ago or four years ago approximately, I had a fallout.
[01:20:16.905 --> 01:20:19.607]  I had to contact a lady named Janet Hall in the States.
[01:20:20.047 --> 01:20:21.588]  She's best friends with Jeff Rents.
[01:20:22.488 --> 01:20:27.952]  She's a microbiologist who had to do a study on me because I had a massive lesion explode in my spinal cord.
[01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:30.213]  She told me that was from chemtrails.
[01:20:30.773 --> 01:20:31.474]  More gallons?
[01:20:32.611 --> 01:20:33.531]  Oh yeah, it was more gallons.
[01:20:33.571 --> 01:20:35.152]  Basically, it was up the line of more gallons.
[01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:41.813]  I've survived quadriplegia, thank God for my background and my training, and I've gone through a detox.
[01:20:42.253 --> 01:20:53.315]  I've basically survived to live through a criminal trial, and I've been at doctors and lawyers, and I've been confronting judges and crowns and telling them what kind of Mason system that we've been living under.
[01:20:53.335 --> 01:20:57.476]  I mean, I've basically been allowed to say everything I need to say, even on a stand in a trial.
[01:20:57.956 --> 01:20:58.096]  Good!
[01:20:58.156 --> 01:20:58.737]  Good job!
[01:20:58.757 --> 01:20:58.917]  Good job!
[01:20:58.937 --> 01:20:59.317]  Anything else?
[01:20:59.417 --> 01:20:59.577]  Good!
[01:20:59.617 --> 01:20:59.737]  Good!
[01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:23.051]  That's what they want.
[01:21:23.071 --> 01:21:27.095]  They want to break up the families and they get the men to act bad, the women to act bad.
[01:21:27.436 --> 01:21:28.737]  Folks, you're all under attack.
[01:21:28.857 --> 01:21:29.558]  Stick together.
[01:21:29.698 --> 01:21:30.840]  All you've got is your family.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:31.901]  It's us against them.
[01:21:31.961 --> 01:21:32.642]  Thank you for the call.
[01:21:32.922 --> 01:21:34.504]  Let's go back live to the full transmission.
[01:21:37.765 --> 01:21:40.726]  Bob, you know, the establishment goes after our families.
[01:21:41.347 --> 01:21:44.888]  But if you just explain to your family, don't you know the family's under attack?
[01:21:44.948 --> 01:21:46.189]  It's only us we can trust.
[01:21:46.749 --> 01:21:48.590]  That's what keeps families together.
[01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.571]  And that is so important, Bob.
[01:21:51.851 --> 01:21:53.152]  How important is the family?
[01:21:54.793 --> 01:21:57.454]  It is the reason for existence.
[01:21:59.156 --> 01:21:59.737]  Absolutely.
[01:21:59.777 --> 01:22:03.239]  So stop fighting with your husband and wife if your wife's being mean to you and arrogant.
[01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:04.801]  Stop fighting with her.
[01:22:04.821 --> 01:22:06.682]  Get to the level of explaining to her the big picture.
[01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:09.124]  If your husband's doing it, you know, stop it.
[01:22:09.444 --> 01:22:10.785]  Stop fighting with each other.
[01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:11.286]  Stop it.
[01:22:11.326 --> 01:22:12.386]  Don't use drugs.
[01:22:12.787 --> 01:22:14.208]  Don't get in their debt system.
[01:22:14.788 --> 01:22:15.309]  Beat them.
[01:22:15.349 --> 01:22:18.071]  You beat them by living well, as the French say.
[01:22:18.571 --> 01:22:19.832]  The best revenge is living well.
[01:22:20.153 --> 01:22:21.173]  Paula, thanks for the call.
[01:22:21.494 --> 01:22:22.274]  Helen in Florida.
[01:22:22.294 --> 01:22:23.255]  I've got to move quick here.
[01:22:23.295 --> 01:22:24.516]  Helen, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[01:22:25.717 --> 01:22:25.857]  Yes.
[01:22:26.237 --> 01:22:28.219]  Three quick statements and then one question.
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:31.141]  First, Jesus did not appear to let us become extinct.
[01:22:31.542 --> 01:22:37.125]  The second one is, Rabbi Israel Weiss said that Israel now is not the Israel that's predicted in the Bible.
[01:22:37.685 --> 01:22:38.926]  The Orthodox Jews say that.
[01:22:39.366 --> 01:22:41.467]  And then, I wish there were more Jack McLams.
[01:22:41.847 --> 01:22:43.028]  And then my question is,
[01:22:43.467 --> 01:22:44.908]  Well, I think it goes with a number of other things.
[01:22:45.148 --> 01:22:48.950]  They're trying to hold the market up, they're trying to make the dollar go higher, and the reason for that is to
[01:23:12.679 --> 01:23:13.280]  We're good to go.
[01:23:42.646 --> 01:23:48.294]  And so I think in the long term, if you want gold and silver related assets, you keep them.
[01:23:49.295 --> 01:23:57.126]  This would be a very good opportunity when gold and silver have come down substantially, along with the shares.
[01:23:58.211 --> 01:24:07.076]  Yeah, bottom line, they can have paper money artificially worth something, but they can artificially devalue metal.
[01:24:07.576 --> 01:24:15.260]  But in reality, metal has the real value, and historically, if you look at it on a graph, it always only goes up with inflation.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:18.621]  And so you've got something that's an emergency backup.
[01:24:18.701 --> 01:24:19.561]  I bought gold at $300.
[01:24:20.181 --> 01:24:21.321]  I bought gold at $1,000.
[01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:22.341]  I've just kept it all.
[01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:23.682]  The little bit I've got in silver.
[01:24:24.042 --> 01:24:29.883]  It doesn't matter to me because I know it's real and it's an insurance policy and that's what it's all about.
[01:24:30.383 --> 01:24:31.983]  Do I feel good about the $300 gold?
[01:24:32.063 --> 01:24:32.283]  Yes.
[01:24:32.303 --> 01:24:33.804]  Do I feel bad about the $1,000 gold?
[01:24:34.364 --> 01:24:36.164]  No, because it's all real.
[01:24:36.504 --> 01:24:37.544]  It's based in reality.

[01:25:01.342 --> 01:25:03.603]  Didn't have you on week before this one.
[01:25:04.184 --> 01:25:05.365]  And Godspeed, my friend.
[01:25:06.385 --> 01:25:07.146]  Same to you, Alex.
[01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:08.767]  You're doing wonderful work.
[01:25:09.147 --> 01:25:09.447]  Bye-bye.
[01:25:09.608 --> 01:25:10.008]  I'm trying.
[01:25:10.048 --> 01:25:10.428]  You are, too.
[01:25:10.868 --> 01:25:11.289]  Okay.
[01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:15.892]  Before I end this transmission, I just want to remind the listeners
[01:25:19.102 --> 01:25:28.109]  That A, re-transmission starts with Ralph Nader and some of the other guests we had on were amazing today.
[01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:33.011]  And at the end of the show, in about one minute, we just come right back.
[01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:36.152]  But you've got to be on the InfoWars.com audio streams.
[01:25:36.472 --> 01:25:37.073]  The only place.
