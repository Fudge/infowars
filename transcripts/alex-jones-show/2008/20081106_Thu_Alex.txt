[00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:09.276]  I wouldn't count personally myself on a company that's going to save you during an emergency.
[00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.456]  I would take care of yourself.
[00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:16.521]  The government isn't going to save you during an emergency.
[00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:17.482]  I'll guarantee you that.
[00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:19.423]  Nine times out of ten.
[00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:28.200]  You probably can't count on your neighbors, or even in some cases, your family.
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.281]  You gotta take care of yourself and your children.
[00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:36.623]  And, uh... Ah, it doesn't even matter.
[00:00:36.643 --> 00:00:36.983]  Whatever.
[00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.143]  Heather in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:39.504]  Welcome.
[00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:41.304]  Did you say Heather?
[00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:42.164]  Yes, I did.
[00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:43.705]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:44.705]  Fine, thank you.
[00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:47.606]  Um, I'm calling not to ask a question.
[00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:52.948]  I'm sorry you hear a lot of these people that are, um... I guess they choose their ignorance is the best way to say, um...
[00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:53.676]  Good!
[00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:32.934]  We've had 13 episodes, we go over the same thing you do, you know, Bernays, and I just don't, I mean, I go to the bar every night, I don't have any kids or any kind of responsibility besides work and all that, but I try to tell people, and they tell me the Patriot Act, it's not for, you know, it's for terrorists, it's not for citizens, they won't wake up, they won't wake up, but my whole point, and what I'd like to remind your audience, is that as evil as these people are, there's a light that's brighter, and it's the only thing that we have,
[00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:37.128]  Yeah, somebody's calling you.
[00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:37.928]  You want to take that call?
[00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.710]  Okay, but I just want on record we're not censoring you.
[00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.631]  Listeners will think that.
[00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:47.773]  But you're getting another call, so it's going to probably blip out in just a second again.
[00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:52.135]  So I just want to wait for that to happen and then we can continue.
[00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:57.440]  I mean, if you fight fire with fire, they have bigger guns, they have all these technologies.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.186]  I mean, I went to school in Moctrusas, to NMSU, and when I first got down there, I saw the chemtrails, because White Sands is right there.
[00:02:03.627 --> 00:02:10.113]  And this was before they disclosed that they were going to do the chemtrails to, you know, do global dimming, to put the, you know, pulverized...
[00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:14.777]  Even though they've admitted they're doing it, the public doesn't believe it.
[00:02:14.797 --> 00:02:23.703]  Well, when I was 19 and I went to NMSU, I didn't know this, and I looked up at the sky, and I saw that, and I was like, I bet you Bush didn't lie when he said he was going to do something about global warming.
[00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:24.644]  I bet you anything.
[00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:35.871]  And then it comes out that I was right, and so were you, and so was everybody else, and it's a good thing, because there's like a wavelength that the people that are awake, they know it's there, and we know it's there, and we know what they're doing.
[00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:47.451]  Yeah, they have us by our, you know, whatever you want to call it right now, but if you want to get biblical with it, I'm not really religious and spiritual, but I just...
[00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:54.245]  I'm scared to death, I know, and I know these people tell you to calm down, and it's like, how do you calm down when there's a loaded gun to your head?
[00:02:54.445 --> 00:03:07.391]  Well, number one, number one, you go back to those people and you say, I know you think it's tough or manly to not care about reality and to not care about your country, but you can bring them the, you know, Google, and then bring them mainline articles.
[00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:08.471]  I mean, I would do it.
[00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:15.034]  And you know it's thousands and thousands of pages of documents, and you can show them now, but they've got to be patient enough to listen, and they're not.
[00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:16.275]  Well, hold on just a second.
[00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:19.949]  Just on the subject of the Patriot Act, only being for LCIA to
[00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:36.906]  They used the Patriot Act on a prison guard, ordered to torture people to death in Afghanistan, and even came out in the news to muzzle him, because he was going to use it in his defense that he was ordered to torture from the White House, which later came out.
[00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:43.629]  And they said, nope, Patriot Act, you're a terrorist, you're not allowed to have free speech or have a public trial.
[00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.491]  So you can bring them mainstream news articles where
[00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:56.201]  You know, headline, Patriot Act used in thousands of non-terror cases in Tennessee or in Georgia.
[00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:59.004]  I mean, every state has had the same headline.
[00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:01.086]  They're using it against everybody.
[00:04:01.446 --> 00:04:02.887]  It has nothing to do with terror.
[00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:07.892]  But if you're a real Las Zetas terrorist murdering police in South Texas, nothing's done to you.
[00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.095]  This is all for us, the cattle.
[00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:16.400]  Because the system has to promise its criminals more houses, more money, more cash.
[00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:23.167]  So, that's what happens when a Caesar takes over Rome, he gives his praetorian goods.
[00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:27.912]  And they would always squeeze the middle class.
[00:04:28.332 --> 00:04:29.934]  But, go ahead, Heather.
[00:04:30.424 --> 00:04:33.945]  Yeah, they talk about conspiracy theories, but they're like, oh, you're just a conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:33.965 --> 00:04:36.266]  And I'm like, well, what was, you know, the whole lone thing?
[00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:38.607]  How has every dickheader ever taken over?
[00:04:38.627 --> 00:04:40.288]  I mean, it's been conspiracy throughout history.
[00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:45.930]  You know, I wouldn't argue with cowards that want to sit around and suck their thumbs and laugh at you, Heather.
[00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.552]  I would move on and find people, and there are plenty of them, that are awake.
[00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:50.732]  I mean, I'm here in West Texas.
[00:04:50.752 --> 00:04:52.333]  There's not as many as there are in Austin, man.
[00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:53.854]  There's a few of us, but there's not as many.
[00:04:53.994 --> 00:04:55.514]  Well, those people are dead.
[00:04:55.634 --> 00:04:56.715]  They're fake Texans.
[00:04:57.655 --> 00:04:59.156]  They're all hat and no cattle.
[00:05:00.597 --> 00:05:01.737]  They watch their football.
[00:05:01.777 --> 00:05:02.578]  They act tough.
[00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:06.160]  They drive around in big trucks with Marine Corps stickers on their cars.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.621]  They hate America.
[00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:08.861]  They're pieces of trash.
[00:05:09.302 --> 00:05:10.182]  They're cowards.
[00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:11.443]  They're not real Texans.
[00:05:11.483 --> 00:05:12.643]  They're not real Americans.
[00:05:12.984 --> 00:05:17.866]  They've got their big hat and no cattle, feeling good, and they're going to find out.
[00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:18.587]  So let them!
[00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:19.487]  Move on!
[00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:20.168]  Move on!
[00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:20.328]  Move on!
[00:05:20.348 --> 00:05:20.808]  Move on!
[00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:28.260]  But we can't forget, and when people tell you not to freak out, I mean, tell them, you know, you're freaking out because you're trying to wake these people up.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.881]  And we know that.
[00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:29.841]  Your listeners do know this.
[00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.503]  And we definitely, we do have the light on our side.
[00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:33.363]  We are connected.
[00:05:33.443 --> 00:05:34.944]  We are connected, as connected as they are.
[00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.485]  Well, it's like you said, you're trying to wake folks up at bars, though.
[00:05:37.946 --> 00:05:38.946]  They're there for escape.
[00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:40.767]  No, I understand, but I mean, they're there, Heather, to pick you up.
[00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:47.575]  Yeah, they're not there to hear about it.
[00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:49.818]  These aren't people of responsibility.
[00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.642]  All they are is acting cool.
[00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:53.804]  They wear a cowboy hat.
[00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:55.165]  They wear a ball cap.
[00:05:56.107 --> 00:05:58.169]  They stick their chest out and walk around going,
[00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:01.171]  And to them, that's their whole world.
[00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:05.292]  So how can they ever change?
[00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:07.833]  They have no self-respect for themselves, too.
[00:06:08.213 --> 00:06:10.994]  They can't imagine themselves facing down a corrupt government.
[00:06:11.194 --> 00:06:13.795]  They're scared when a cop pulls these tough guys over.
[00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:15.935]  They cower.
[00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:17.636]  They're cowards!
[00:06:17.656 --> 00:06:18.856]  They're un-American filth!
[00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:26.705]  And so they don't respect themselves enough to go to city council or educate themselves or find out what's happening.
[00:06:27.106 --> 00:06:30.130]  They just are cowards who want to believe everything's okay.
[00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.433]  And so don't worry, they're going to get hurt real bad.
[00:06:34.215 --> 00:06:44.665]  I don't know if I can believe in the whole fighting fire with fire thing, because to me, when I was in Las Cruces, I also got to see the Halliburton terrorist containment cell that they're building on the airbase out there.
[00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:49.249]  And I got to drive through the loop in East Montana, right before Montana exits in El Paso.
[00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:54.312]  I know, and then it could be in the Houston Chronicle and the public says, ain't real!
[00:07:17.483 --> 00:07:19.764]  Hey, the bankers taking all your money is real.
[00:07:19.784 --> 00:07:22.605]  I want everybody out there, the raping you're getting is real.
[00:07:23.246 --> 00:07:24.566]  Heather, I appreciate your story.
[00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:29.929]  You know what you ought to do is videotape that El Paso FEMA camp and then show everybody.
[00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:34.111]  Just keep doing what you're doing and you've got the spirit, you're fired up, you're upset.
[00:07:34.531 --> 00:07:36.972]  That's what it's going to take to reach out to people, so God bless you.
[00:07:37.492 --> 00:07:42.515]  But yeah, I know West Texas is just a ghost yard of mindless phony conservatism.
[00:07:43.274 --> 00:07:47.237]  It's like a lot of inner cities are ghost towns mentally of mindless Obama worshippers.
[00:07:48.097 --> 00:07:49.739]  Let's talk to Robert in California.
[00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.520]  You're on the air, Robert, and Joe, Dan, and others.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.081]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:07:53.101 --> 00:07:53.241]  Good.
[00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:55.002]  I've got about a minute and a half.
[00:07:55.323 --> 00:07:56.023]  Okay.
[00:07:56.223 --> 00:08:11.214]  First of all, I actually ran for the Central Committee in an area down in L.A., and we got elected, and there's plenty of us, and that's one of the things that people can do is actually run for their Central Committees and their bases and city councils and things like that.
[00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:12.435]  I agree.
[00:08:12.455 --> 00:08:13.197]  And there is a certain...
[00:08:23.766 --> 00:08:30.752]  You need to decide whether you're going to be a public fighter of the New World Order or if you're going to be a covert fighter.
[00:08:30.772 --> 00:08:31.853]  And we need them all.
[00:08:31.893 --> 00:08:33.014]  We're going into very dark times.
[00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:34.375]  We're in the system.
[00:08:34.736 --> 00:08:36.357]  This is going to get really serious.
[00:08:36.738 --> 00:08:45.666]  We need people to play like they're even with the system, to be there at every level of government, spying on the enemy operations, spying on the hijackers.
[00:08:46.406 --> 00:08:48.127]  I think we can do a little bit of both, too.
[00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:51.248]  You can actually play nice and get people to like you, but it's also a thing about losing your fear.
[00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.832]  And knowing that you have power within yourself, so... Yeah, a lot of people are scared and timid.
[00:09:15.852 --> 00:09:17.913]  Like, I know this sounds kooky, but here's a free DVD.
[00:09:18.193 --> 00:09:20.154]  No, you're like, hey, serious stuff's going on.
[00:09:20.174 --> 00:09:21.174]  This is a really hot video.
[00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:21.894]  You need to check it out.
[00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:22.755]  Tell me what you think about it.
[00:09:22.775 --> 00:09:24.195]  You gotta be confident.
[00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:24.535]  Stay there.
[00:09:24.555 --> 00:09:25.256]  I'm gonna let you finish up.
[00:09:25.276 --> 00:09:28.137]  Let me get to... Luke Rudowsky, I appreciate you coming in.
[00:09:28.157 --> 00:09:28.817]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:28.837 --> 00:09:29.357]  Stay with us.
[00:09:30.398 --> 00:09:30.758]  Jim Newcombe.
[00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:32.319]  In fact, let me just skip this break, John.
[00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:34.940]  You're at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.100]  You got Luke on the line?
[00:09:37.481 --> 00:09:37.861]  It's ringing.
[00:09:39.636 --> 00:09:45.681]  Let me just go ahead and go back to Robert, so at least the internet audience can hear him finish up, since I cut him off.
[00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:55.388]  Robert, go ahead and tell the listeners, obviously you can go in there and act friendly and not scare them too much, and it's how you announce it.
[00:09:56.409 --> 00:09:59.892]  You can take the smooth approach, you can take the in-their-face approach, different things work.
[00:10:00.732 --> 00:10:06.116]  Or I'm saying we also need to realize we're going into very dark times, and down the road,
[00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:08.077]  You know, we got people everywhere.
[00:10:08.397 --> 00:10:09.077]  And who are we?
[00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:12.538]  People that love liberty, people that love freedom, now known as terrorists.
[00:10:13.078 --> 00:10:13.558]  Anything else?
[00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:16.599]  Yeah, and you're right on that point.
[00:10:16.719 --> 00:10:24.261]  And it's basically not necessarily getting in their face, because a lot of people have been brainwashed a little bit about washing their brain clean.
[00:10:24.681 --> 00:10:26.041]  It's like reverse brainwashing.
[00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:29.262]  You know, I had a brother tell me one time, you know, I had a head full of stuff.
[00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:34.871]  And he says, you know, and I said, well, you know, I'm bringing all this stuff, you know, this new stuff to my people.
[00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:36.272]  And they're saying, oh, you're getting brainwashed.
[00:10:36.312 --> 00:10:38.192]  He says, yeah, your brain is being washed clean.
[00:10:38.673 --> 00:10:43.294]  It's getting all the muck that's in from this world like to put into it.
[00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:48.357]  It's sort of like you said with the thing about the rapture, you know, everybody's waiting around.
[00:10:48.437 --> 00:10:49.977]  Christians are waiting for the rapture.
[00:10:50.437 --> 00:10:52.158]  And the Bible doesn't even speak about that.
[00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:56.840]  It speaks about a change of who we are, not a change of our geographical location.
[00:10:57.748 --> 00:10:59.709]  So, and that's where it's all going to start.
[00:10:59.729 --> 00:11:02.350]  We have to start from a change within us.
[00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:08.332]  Well, regardless, look at the fruit of the phony Christian movement saying rejoice that horrible things are happening.
[00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:09.612]  That means Jesus is almost here.
[00:11:10.032 --> 00:11:20.116]  Regardless, you have a responsibility to fight evil, to warn people, to say no to all this, but as the microchip comes in, as the thumb scanners go in the grocery stores, it's all happening
[00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:27.821]  As the troops march around in black uniforms, they're going, Oh, it's of the Lord to fight Al Qaeda!
[00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:29.222]  Absolutely.
[00:11:29.242 --> 00:11:30.923]  I mean, it's disgusting filth.
[00:11:31.603 --> 00:11:32.124]  Absolutely.
[00:11:32.164 --> 00:11:35.666]  But we also know that all things work for good to those who love God.
[00:11:36.186 --> 00:11:46.293]  And even, like you said, with this left-right paradigm that's going to be shattered, we know that when things are bad that people begin to wake up and say, Hey, you know, I need to do something and stand up.
[00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:50.136]  Prayers are just not words that we send into our empty closet.
[00:11:50.523 --> 00:11:53.205]  It also has to take feet and action to those prayers.
[00:11:54.326 --> 00:11:58.670]  Yeah, but then the phony Baptists and stuff say, no, it's grace alone, obviously.
[00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.413]  But once you have grace, you're going to show the fruit, or you aren't really saved.
[00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:04.194]  Right.
[00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:07.517]  And then they'll argue and go, no, no, no!
[00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:09.959]  And then, I like torture!
[00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:11.240]  It's of the Lord!
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.381]  And them Iraqis ain't human beings!
[00:12:13.742 --> 00:12:15.503]  They're seed of the devil and all!
[00:12:15.823 --> 00:12:16.324]  I love them!
[00:12:16.404 --> 00:12:17.605]  Millions of them are dead!
[00:12:17.645 --> 00:12:18.926]  It's of the Lord!
[00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:23.988]  Well, it's like when I told my friend, you know, Jesus says, you know, sell your other coat and buy a sword.
[00:12:24.648 --> 00:12:26.009]  And he looked at me and, what do you mean?
[00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:32.373]  No, no, Romans 13, lay down, give them, go to the FEMA camp, it's of the Lord!
[00:12:32.393 --> 00:12:39.437]  And having our police and our feds secretly paying the preachers to prepare us to go to camps, that's freedom!
[00:12:39.457 --> 00:12:41.439]  That's what America's all about!
[00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:43.120]  It's wonderful!
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.081]  We're gonna fight Al-Qaeda!
[00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:52.127]  Yeah, and that's what all governors throughout the world have always had an enemy for us to fight.
[00:12:52.699 --> 00:12:57.120]  And not really, you know, first deal with a battle that's within us, and then deal with a battle that's without us.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.861]  You know what it sounds like to me?
[00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:01.401]  Sounds like you're a KGB commie.
[00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:04.202]  Sounds like you're an infiltrator.
[00:13:04.862 --> 00:13:07.723]  Sounds like you don't love the Lord!
[00:13:07.743 --> 00:13:10.644]  We're gonna put you in a work camp, boy!
[00:13:10.904 --> 00:13:13.005]  That'll teach you to love the Lord!
[00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.205]  Appreciate your call, man.
[00:13:14.225 --> 00:13:15.485]  Alright, have a good day.
[00:13:15.505 --> 00:13:16.146]  Good to hear from you.
[00:13:16.206 --> 00:13:17.466]  Alright, we got Luke Radowski, right?
[00:13:17.946 --> 00:13:18.646]  Yep, he's all set.
[00:13:18.706 --> 00:13:20.707]  Alright, well, bring us back in and I'll go to him.
[00:13:21.448 --> 00:13:22.548]  I got all bummed out earlier.
[00:13:22.608 --> 00:13:25.129]  Now I'm starting to think about how horrible things are.
[00:13:25.169 --> 00:13:28.731]  But, you know, when I think about what scum the neocons are, it makes me feel better, you know.
[00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:29.531]  Here we go.
[00:13:29.551 --> 00:13:37.954]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:13:37.974 --> 00:13:43.376]  All right, for this segment, a little bit into the next, we've got Luke Rudowsky, the founder of We Are Change.
[00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:45.837]  Now, I don't know how many chapters around the planet.
[00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.111]  Talk about solutions.
[00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:48.892]  This is a big part of it.
[00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.873]  Whether it's 9-11 Truth, We Are Change.
[00:13:51.154 --> 00:13:56.058]  You can call yourself the Truth Crusaders.
[00:13:56.638 --> 00:13:57.139]  I don't care.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.860]  Info Warriors.
[00:14:00.322 --> 00:14:02.203]  You can call yourself...
[00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.648]  I don't know, Commander Cody and the Rocket Brigade, for all I care.
[00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:11.650]  The point is, get out there, confront your mayors, your county commissioners, bring up real points.
[00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.871]  Every week, hammer on them, hammer on them.
[00:14:13.911 --> 00:14:14.971]  Talk about martial law.
[00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.352]  Talk about FEMA camps.
[00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:18.032]  Talk about how the government deals the drugs.
[00:14:18.653 --> 00:14:22.454]  For their tyranny to unfold, they have to have legitimacy with the mindless zombies.
[00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:26.036]  You wake up the zombies, you wake up the public, you tell people what's coming?
[00:14:26.676 --> 00:14:29.118]  Then, as they see it unfold, you'll get even more credibility.
[00:14:29.378 --> 00:14:32.540]  We're actually making great inroads, and we are changing all over the world.
[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:41.145]  It's getting some great interviews, great confrontations, all of it, which then takes over the media, takes over the culture, and lets the enemy know we're aware of their criminal activities.
[00:14:41.465 --> 00:14:43.026]  Luke Rodowski, so much going on.
[00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:43.726]  Tell us all about it.
[00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:48.389]  Well, thanks for having me on, and they're really rubbing things up here in the city.
[00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.211]  Wherever I go, I'm always accosted by security officers.
[00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:54.473]  I'll tell you one time, I came out to an event, 7 a.m.,
[00:14:55.038 --> 00:14:57.619]  In the Bronx to confront Mayor Bloomberg.
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.441]  And as soon as I get there, I have four security guards already all over me.
[00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:02.442]  I didn't even do anything.
[00:15:02.462 --> 00:15:03.703]  I just walked in the building.
[00:15:04.063 --> 00:15:08.685]  They pushed me in the corner and they do not let me leave until Bloomberg leaves the damn area.
[00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.347]  And they came up to me and they already knew my name.
[00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:14.368]  I already told them, how in the world do you know my name?
[00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:17.590]  And they're like, yeah, we've been following you and your organization.
[00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.971]  And Bloomberg's not taking any questions.
[00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.732]  And I'm like, am I being detained?
[00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:24.648]  And they said no, and they wouldn't let me leave.
[00:15:24.908 --> 00:15:28.773]  And they basically, they were just blocking me off.
[00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:31.336]  Every time I tried to walk away, they would just corner me in.
[00:15:31.815 --> 00:15:34.437]  And then just bump me and not let me move anywhere.
[00:15:34.697 --> 00:15:35.597]  That same day!
[00:15:35.878 --> 00:15:42.341]  That's intimidation so that you don't keep asking the mayor about getting health care for the firemen and police.
[00:15:43.022 --> 00:15:43.482]  Exactly.
[00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:44.523]  They already know my name.
[00:15:44.563 --> 00:15:45.563]  They already know who I am.
[00:15:45.603 --> 00:15:48.965]  That same day I got really pissed off that they violated my rights this way.
[00:15:49.286 --> 00:15:52.888]  That same day I confronted the mayor at 7pm in Manhattan.
[00:15:53.768 --> 00:15:55.389]  And I luckily got through security.
[00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:57.491]  I got there just as Bloomberg was leaving.
[00:15:57.631 --> 00:16:01.533]  I got right in his face and I was like, how come you're not supporting the 9-11 first responders?
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.644]  How dare you say that the James Sodroga bill is an undue tax burden?
[00:16:05.884 --> 00:16:08.086]  And he ran off and his security guards pushed me off.
[00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:14.237]  An incredible thing is happening in the city where we confronted Mayor Bloomberg three times in one week.
[00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.259]  Me, Brian Kenney, Matt McKenzie.
[00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:19.001]  And now they've contacted you and said we'll give you a meeting with the mayor.
[00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:21.462]  That shows they hate seeing the humans.
[00:16:21.723 --> 00:16:22.883]  They hate hearing you.
[00:16:22.963 --> 00:16:25.025]  Oh, you're asking the mayor questions.
[00:16:25.045 --> 00:16:25.946]  You're a terrorist.
[00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.567]  And you caught the cops trying to say you had bombs.
[00:16:28.848 --> 00:16:29.608]  They got in trouble.
[00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:31.910]  You are the terrorist and we're going to expose you.
[00:16:32.694 --> 00:16:36.577]  But we're trying to make things work, and they told us, look, whatever you do, we'll do whatever you want.
[00:16:36.617 --> 00:16:37.718]  Just stop confronting the mayor.
[00:16:37.979 --> 00:16:39.340]  We don't have a meeting with the mayor.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.162]  We have a meeting with the mayor's secretary and city hall.
[00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:43.643]  Yeah, I was told wrong.
[00:16:43.683 --> 00:16:45.085]  I was told wrong by my office last night.
[00:16:45.105 --> 00:16:46.786]  They told me to give you the meeting.
[00:16:46.826 --> 00:16:47.747]  You're having a meeting with the mayor.
[00:16:48.823 --> 00:16:55.185]  No, we're having a meeting with the Mayor's Secretary and a spokesperson in order to help out first responders.
[00:16:55.225 --> 00:16:58.366]  And we're doing this with other first responders that are going to be with us this Friday.
[00:16:58.606 --> 00:17:04.848]  And we're going to try as best as we can to get the city and persuade the city to help out the dying heroes here in New York City.
[00:17:05.268 --> 00:17:08.709]  And it's really a dire situation that the first responders are going through.
[00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:13.150]  The James DeGrogo bill was not passed by Congress because of Bloomberg's opposition to it.
[00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:16.131]  He said it was an undue tax burden and an unfair bill.
[00:17:16.553 --> 00:17:20.814]  But he doesn't really understand that if it were to pass through Congress, the Senate would have negotiated those deals.
[00:17:20.854 --> 00:17:25.115]  Well, look, the military's not being given the health care, and that's how it works.
[00:17:25.135 --> 00:17:25.996]  You're trash to them.
[00:17:26.036 --> 00:17:27.276]  Cops, firemen, police.
[00:17:27.636 --> 00:17:28.697]  You are garbage.
[00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:29.917]  You are garbage.
[00:17:30.337 --> 00:17:33.638]  Nobody wants to help the people who serve this country, and that's why.
[00:17:33.698 --> 00:17:34.458]  You are garbage.
[00:17:34.578 --> 00:17:36.119]  Let me finish, because it can be taken on.
[00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:38.179]  You are garbage to the New World Order.
[00:17:38.879 --> 00:17:42.581]  They only want you to wrap yourself in the flag and be fooled by them.
[00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:43.601]  They hate your guts.
[00:17:43.641 --> 00:17:44.161]  Go ahead, Luke.
[00:17:44.381 --> 00:17:53.831]  Exactly, that's why they disrespect the police and the military, and that's why we're seeing a lot of police and military come up to us at Ground Zero every Saturday, like we're out there, and support us and help us out.
[00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:56.114]  Yeah, they're even coming up on video now, that's the big deal, yeah.
[00:17:56.678 --> 00:18:04.421]  Yeah, and you know, they're giving us army patches with Not 11 Truth on there, and they're huge supporters of what we're doing, because we, the people, support them.
[00:18:04.681 --> 00:18:08.122]  The government, the elites, do not support them, and that's what we have to understand.
[00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:08.742]  We have to reach out.
[00:18:08.762 --> 00:18:11.623]  Well, there's five trillion for the bankers, but nothing for the firemen.
[00:18:12.343 --> 00:18:20.966]  Exactly, and that's why this movement is going to be successful, because the police and the military are going to be on our side, and it's our job to educate them about what's really happening.
[00:18:21.206 --> 00:18:23.087]  But yet again, security is revving up.
[00:18:23.147 --> 00:18:26.248]  I went to the Bill Clinton event a couple weeks ago, and you know,
[00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:28.788]  I'm getting right close to Bill Clinton.
[00:18:28.848 --> 00:18:30.232]  Get ready to shake his hand.
[00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:31.314]  Get ready to talk to him.
[00:18:31.615 --> 00:18:34.302]  And before that, I have security thugs just hitting me on my shoulder.
[00:18:34.642 --> 00:18:35.422]  Push me away.
[00:18:35.723 --> 00:18:42.887]  And the whole time I realized I was being followed by Secret Service in the event, wherever I went throughout the event.
[00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:46.189]  But then luckily... Well, Luke, I don't, I mean, frankly, I don't blame them.
[00:18:46.229 --> 00:18:55.694]  You did plant a power, I mean, this is on record, a big, powerful, it was great, audio system in the Bill Clinton CFR meeting, and then they went in the bathroom.
[00:18:55.754 --> 00:18:57.435]  Tell folks that story when we get back, okay?
[00:18:57.996 --> 00:18:58.336]  Definitely.
[00:18:58.536 --> 00:19:02.858]  I mean, you talk about effective, shaking up these murdering scumbag criminals.
[00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:06.739]  Bill Clinton's been involved in all the big white kidnapping rings, all the slave camps.
[00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:09.560]  They get little kids and snuff film them, blow their brains out.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.261]  Go read all the government documents on that if you don't believe me.
[00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:13.561]  Oh yeah.
[00:19:13.721 --> 00:19:14.562]  Paul's in there going, what?
[00:19:14.582 --> 00:19:16.042]  I'll show you right now, mainstream news.
[00:19:16.702 --> 00:19:17.723]  Yeah, Bill Clinton supports it.
[00:19:18.643 --> 00:19:19.623]  Blow little kids' heads off.
[00:19:20.644 --> 00:19:21.544]  We're on the march.
[00:19:22.024 --> 00:19:23.545]  The empire's on the run.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.283]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19:27.303 --> 00:19:28.905]  Hey, bring me up to Luke for the internet audience.
[00:19:28.925 --> 00:19:29.646]  I'm going to keep going here.
[00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:35.412]  Hey Luke, Paul's a guy I hired out of Kelby J. He also works for a local TV station.
[00:19:35.452 --> 00:19:36.053]  He's come along.
[00:19:36.093 --> 00:19:36.774]  He's a smart guy.
[00:19:37.174 --> 00:19:38.916]  But I always say to him every day, it kind of freaks him out.
[00:19:39.317 --> 00:19:42.500]  Why don't you tell him, and of course we have thousands of articles.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.381]  This is mainstream news.
[00:19:44.392 --> 00:20:00.724]  about Clinton and Dyncor, and then under Bush, Clinton, Dyncor and Halliburton, the BBC, AP, Reuters, people don't know about this because it never gets in the nightly news, it's only in the newspapers, about the giant slave rings and the kids and the snuff rings and how they do snuff films.
[00:20:01.224 --> 00:20:07.268]  Yeah, Kofi Annan gave the contracts to them, the UN General Secretary, Kofi Annan.
[00:20:07.369 --> 00:20:10.551]  And when we asked Kofi Annan, he just ran away about those issues.
[00:20:11.718 --> 00:20:15.942]  And then there's been congressional hearings where Rumsfeld just said, we're not going to talk about it.
[00:20:16.243 --> 00:20:18.865]  Yeah, we're not taking it, Dinecourt's contract away.
[00:20:19.706 --> 00:20:21.228]  And folks... Exactly, and it's just ridiculous.
[00:20:21.308 --> 00:20:28.315]  I mean, Kofi Annan was coming out and we asked him how come he gave contracts to Dinecourt when he knew they had child slavery.
[00:20:29.255 --> 00:20:32.097]  I mean, it's just ludicrous.
[00:20:32.158 --> 00:20:34.919]  And this man just walked away, ran away from the questions.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.961]  It wasn't just Africa.
[00:20:37.001 --> 00:20:42.745]  They grabbed over a million kids, about 200,000 of them, just out of Central and Eastern Europe alone.
[00:20:43.145 --> 00:20:48.089]  And then the Italian TV reported that they were snuff films and then sold in the U.S.
[00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:50.090]  I mean, these people are just sick.
[00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:59.694]  It just shows you what kind of people these really... I mean, it's just incredible knowing that these people will stoop that low and do these horrible things, and nobody knows about them.
[00:20:59.734 --> 00:21:00.835]  Everybody thinks they're heroes.
[00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.136]  Everybody shakes their hand.
[00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:03.216]  But that's their religion!
[00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:06.017]  Their religion is about torturing a small child.
[00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:09.319]  The power, the horror, crushing the innocence.
[00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:10.720]  And they just run everything.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.163]  Look at the mock child sacrifices at the Bohemian Grove that all the elected officials go to each summer.
[00:21:17.563 --> 00:21:18.624]  I mean, that you exposed.
[00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:20.184]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:21.785]  And we also got video.
[00:21:21.805 --> 00:21:27.888]  We confronted Bill Richardson, again, when he was running for president, about the Behemian Grove, and he was just sweating.
[00:21:28.188 --> 00:21:30.149]  I mean, it was at a press conference.
[00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.810]  I shook his hand.
[00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.030]  I was the first question.
[00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:41.595]  I was like, sir, can you please tell me, when you gave the keynote speech at Behemian Grove, what did you do there, and how come New York Times reports that there's male prostitutes shipped in there?
[00:21:41.935 --> 00:21:47.238]  And the man just literally looked at me and just turned his back to me and started talking to the other press guys.
[00:21:47.526 --> 00:21:50.649]  And then Matt LePace from the other side, just nailed him again.
[00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:52.130]  What'd he do at the Behemoth Grove?
[00:21:52.210 --> 00:22:04.099]  And then I nailed him again, and then Matt nailed him again, and literally about five times we asked him the question right to his face, and he just turns around and doesn't say a single word, which shows you these people have something to hide.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.401]  They don't want to talk about the Behemoth Grove.
[00:22:06.421 --> 00:22:09.764]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, bare minimum, it's top gay porn stars daily.
[00:22:10.905 --> 00:22:14.188]  But then that's only one level, and then bathroom gay sex and all that.
[00:22:14.608 --> 00:22:15.348]  That's nothing, though.
[00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:16.830]  The real delicacies
[00:22:18.436 --> 00:22:19.677]  Our shotgun and kids in the head.
[00:22:19.717 --> 00:22:20.617]  I mean, that's what they live for.
[00:22:21.338 --> 00:22:22.399]  Yeah, these people are sick.
[00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:23.659]  We have to resist their tyranny.
[00:22:23.699 --> 00:22:26.261]  We have to do everything to expose what they're doing.
[00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:26.761]  Absolutely.
[00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:27.602]  We're going back live.
[00:22:27.622 --> 00:22:28.322]  We're going back live.
[00:22:28.342 --> 00:22:30.003]  Here we go.
[00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:35.047]  We're freaking Paul out out here.
[00:22:35.067 --> 00:22:36.147]  Paul Google.
[00:22:45.845 --> 00:22:50.147]  Google Chicago Tribune, DynCorp sex slavery.
[00:22:52.268 --> 00:23:03.792]  And then it's the governor going, a few years ago, going, man they kidnapped all these kids and a bunch of them got killed and they have huge airports just filled with slaves flying them out to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Malaysia.
[00:23:04.392 --> 00:23:06.333]  They make snuff films with them.
[00:23:09.354 --> 00:23:13.236]  DynCorp, Halliburton, and
[00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:17.173]  I told some Austin cops about two years ago, I was outside P.F.
[00:23:17.193 --> 00:23:25.540]  Chang's after I ate dinner with some friends, and there's all these cops right by the Dine Corps building, and I said, you know, those guys are into all this, and the cops just laugh and go, yeah, yeah, I work there!
[00:23:25.921 --> 00:23:26.681]  I do work there!
[00:23:26.701 --> 00:23:28.743]  They just laughed at me, looked at me real predatory.
[00:23:30.284 --> 00:23:31.385]  And I was like, whoa!
[00:23:32.406 --> 00:23:35.529]  And, you know, it's like the Texas Youth Commission with the giant rape rings.
[00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.010]  Don't believe me?
[00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.952]  Just type child rape, Texas Youth Commission.
[00:23:39.987 --> 00:23:40.888]  I mean, that's who they are!
[00:23:40.928 --> 00:23:41.408]  They rule!
[00:23:41.428 --> 00:23:41.909]  That's it!
[00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.809]  They run it all!
[00:23:42.829 --> 00:23:49.694]  I mean, if they're going to ship drugs, heroin, and cocaine in, if they're going to torture people, why not run slave rinks?
[00:23:50.074 --> 00:23:51.775]  Why not just run everything?
[00:23:51.796 --> 00:23:53.517]  I mean, they just run it all, folks!
[00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:54.557]  It's all big joke!
[00:23:54.798 --> 00:23:56.499]  We're all fat, dumb cattle, they bleed!
[00:23:56.699 --> 00:23:57.279]  What'd you find, Paul?
[00:23:57.299 --> 00:23:59.341]  Did you Google it?
[00:24:00.342 --> 00:24:03.304]  What'd you find?
[00:24:03.324 --> 00:24:04.745]  We need to get you a microphone out there.
[00:24:06.126 --> 00:24:07.146]  But you did find it, didn't you?
[00:24:08.287 --> 00:24:09.268]  You did find it, that's right.
[00:24:10.506 --> 00:24:12.627]  You got the nerve to Google it right now, listeners?
[00:24:12.947 --> 00:24:14.407]  And read the hundreds of mainstream articles?
[00:24:14.427 --> 00:24:15.447]  They even let you know.
[00:24:15.727 --> 00:24:18.508]  We're going to kidnap, we're going to murder your children, we're going to torture them.
[00:24:18.708 --> 00:24:20.308]  We like it with a new order!
[00:24:20.648 --> 00:24:22.389]  And there's nothing you can do if you don't like it!
[00:24:22.449 --> 00:24:35.832]  We got SWAT teams ready to gun you and your whole family down, because we control you slime, we control you scum, and we're going to bankrupt the dollar and suck everything out of this country, and we're going to turn murdering psycho troops from Iraq loose on you.
[00:24:35.852 --> 00:24:39.713]  You are such hardcore killers, they're murdering their unit commanders all over the U.S.
[00:24:40.453 --> 00:24:41.934]  Slaughtering their wives and children.
[00:24:42.054 --> 00:24:42.694]  Slaughter!
[00:24:42.754 --> 00:24:43.195]  Death!
[00:24:43.535 --> 00:24:44.615]  New World Order!
[00:24:45.296 --> 00:24:45.936]  I'm not kidding.
[00:24:45.956 --> 00:24:46.797]  That's their spirit.
[00:24:46.837 --> 00:24:48.178]  You better grow up, folks.
[00:24:48.758 --> 00:24:53.200]  And I'm glad to hear they're buying all the firearms like never before off the shelves and the ammo's all sold out.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:58.844]  Everyone grabbing Barrett 50s and hardcore ready to fight, you dick, devil, worship, and child molesters.
[00:24:59.224 --> 00:25:00.725]  We're gonna defeat you, New World Order.
[00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:02.326]  You understand, you slimy filth.
[00:25:02.526 --> 00:25:04.167]  I'm not scared of you, you bastards.
[00:25:04.407 --> 00:25:05.488]  I know you're pure evil.
[00:25:05.628 --> 00:25:06.908]  We're gonna kick your ass.
[00:25:08.449 --> 00:25:09.370]  Go ahead, Rodowski.
[00:25:10.825 --> 00:25:15.388]  We are not afraid of them and we are making everything happen here in New York City.
[00:25:15.488 --> 00:25:20.932]  Even though I got accosted by Secret Service and they pushed me away and I had somebody following me the whole day during the event.
[00:25:21.572 --> 00:25:24.394]  We had a new great kid named Anthony Varas come in there.
[00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:30.503]  And I gave him a camera and he was running away, running in the hallways looking for Bill Clinton and he literally ran into him.
[00:25:30.883 --> 00:25:37.729]  And as Bill Clinton was making a corner, Anthony almost like fell right into Bill Clinton and he confronted him about, about the Bilderberg.
[00:25:37.749 --> 00:25:41.171]  Of course Bill Clinton likes to rape women while he bites their face.
[00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.643]  Again, that came out and was confirmed in the news.
[00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:57.930]  And this new guy that, we've got mainstream news articles, the new guy that Obama, the first guy he's announcing as his Chief of Staff, goes to White House dinners with Bill Clinton and openly in front of the press corps with a huge knife stabs the table going,
[00:26:01.024 --> 00:26:02.485]  In fact, I'm going to read it right now on air.
[00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:03.265]  People don't believe me.
[00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:04.965]  You think I'm joking about that, Paul?
[00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:10.027]  I mean, they just literally, with a big butcher knife, at a press dinner, going, ARGH!
[00:26:10.187 --> 00:26:10.327]  ARGH!
[00:26:10.708 --> 00:26:10.908]  ARGH!
[00:26:10.928 --> 00:26:12.588]  Can't wait till we get the American people's guns!
[00:26:12.848 --> 00:26:13.989]  God, we're going to kill them!
[00:26:14.249 --> 00:26:16.450]  We're going to take everything they've got, like the Red Terror!
[00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:17.050]  ARGH!
[00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.630]  We love it!
[00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:18.330]  Oh, yeah!
[00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:19.911]  Go ahead.
[00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:20.611]  Go ahead!
[00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:24.153]  You going to read that article, or do you want me to talk about it?
[00:26:24.193 --> 00:26:25.233]  No, you go ahead while I find it.
[00:26:25.894 --> 00:26:38.349]  I mean, just like we've got Bill Clinton, when we talk about that story, we actually hit an amplifier in Barnes & Noble, where Bill Clinton was doing an event, and during Bill Clinton's book signing,
[00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.391]  Turn up that amplifier!
[00:26:40.871 --> 00:26:56.237]  And, uh, we had, we were just talking, we took over the audio throughout the whole Bargain Nobles, talking about 9-11 being an inside job, talking about the Bilderberg Group, talking about David Rockefeller, talking about Dime Corp, talking about all these other important issues that the mainstream media won't talk about.
[00:26:56.457 --> 00:27:08.302]  And that's what it's about, the people coming out there, being involved, getting to these elected officials, letting know that, letting know that we know, and exposing them all over YouTube, questioning about the hard questions that the mainstream media will never ask.
[00:27:08.815 --> 00:27:19.024]  And I am so great to have so many amazing people in our group like Sabrina, Matt, Brian, Anthony, who are helping me do the work that I was doing before because right now I am being
[00:27:19.676 --> 00:27:25.541]  Basically surrounded by security guards, pretty much many places that I go to to confront these politicians.
[00:27:25.601 --> 00:27:32.926]  And as I'm being surrounded by security guards, they pretty much leave it open for all these new people to come in and confront these politicians.
[00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:34.948]  And that's why it's so important to get involved.
[00:27:35.168 --> 00:27:37.430]  If you're in the Tri-State area, get involved and we are changed.
[00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:38.511]  We're doing amazing things.
[00:27:38.791 --> 00:27:46.197]  We're out there every Saturday at Ground Zero from 1 o'clock to 5 o'clock, giving out free information, free DVDs to the people, to the military, to the cops.
[00:27:46.647 --> 00:27:51.271]  To educate them about what's really going on, because we have to understand the type of tyranny we're living under.
[00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:52.011]  Absolutely!
[00:27:52.432 --> 00:27:55.534]  And it freaks me out to realize how evil they are, and what we're facing.
[00:27:55.554 --> 00:27:56.715]  Let me read people this headline.
[00:27:57.556 --> 00:28:06.903]  You go to PrisonPlanet.com, the son, who's also tied into other terrorists, of one of the top Zionist terrorists, who bombed all the British and others.
[00:28:08.104 --> 00:28:14.489]  It's a headline, Obama's first appointment as son of Zionist terrorist, Rahm Emanuel's father, was a member of militant group.
[00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:20.573]  That bombed hotels, massacred villagers, Obama picked as a keen supporter of lobbying groups and creating militarized youth brigades.
[00:28:20.893 --> 00:28:22.494]  He's a huge top gun control guy.
[00:28:22.774 --> 00:28:26.537]  He's the head of the youth brigades, helping set that up under Clinton and now under Bush.
[00:28:26.877 --> 00:28:30.960]  Now let me read to you, let me read to you where he said this.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.683]  Now again, this is mainstream news, Rolling Stone Magazine.
[00:28:34.723 --> 00:28:37.225]  This is from Rolling Stone Magazine.
[00:28:38.185 --> 00:28:38.926]  Okay, here it is.
[00:28:40.823 --> 00:28:58.659]  In a 1996 re-election, Bill Clinton, Rahm Emanuel, was so angry at the President's enemies that he stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues in front of the press from the campaign, grabbed a steak knife and began rattling off a list of betrayers, shouting, and you can read the whole Rolling Stone article just like I was doing, just frothing, DEAD!
[00:28:58.799 --> 00:28:59.340]  DEAD!
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.000]  DEAD!
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.641]  DEAD!
[00:29:00.881 --> 00:29:01.341]  DEAD!
[00:29:01.542 --> 00:29:01.942]  DEAD!
[00:29:01.962 --> 00:29:04.004]  And Clinton, all of them were just, oh yes.
[00:29:04.745 --> 00:29:07.428]  I mean, that's why they want our guns, because they're cowardly scum and they want to have their way with us.
[00:29:07.968 --> 00:29:11.032]  And plunging the knife into the table after every time.
[00:29:11.653 --> 00:29:13.635]  Now that's Rolling Stone Magazine.
[00:29:13.655 --> 00:29:14.716]  You can link through and read it.
[00:29:14.956 --> 00:29:16.839]  That's who we're talking, that's who wants your guns.
[00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:17.840]  Go ahead.
[00:29:19.019 --> 00:29:20.880]  I mean, these people are pure evil.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.561]  Even when we asked Kofi Annan, when he was head of the U.N., when he gave Dime Corp.
[00:29:25.841 --> 00:29:29.923]  contracts to have, you know, the sex rings in Africa, he just ran away from us.
[00:29:30.243 --> 00:29:34.704]  He ran away from us when we started him asking questions about why did he allow Dime Corp.
[00:29:34.724 --> 00:29:35.445]  to hold U.N.
[00:29:35.485 --> 00:29:39.606]  contracts in Africa, when they did all the... Well, the manual was in Bosnia, but yeah.
[00:29:40.647 --> 00:29:49.355]  Again, and he ran away, and these people won't answer the questions, but it's about showing them, asking, you know... Well, Rumsfeld did, he said, Rumsfeld said they're allowed to.
[00:29:50.136 --> 00:29:53.218]  People don't believe me, just Google, uh, Rumsfeld, Don Corsex Life.
[00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:55.780]  Yeah, people need to get out there.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.422]  People need to get out there.
[00:29:58.178 --> 00:30:01.881]  Ask our elected officials the hard questions, and show the response to the world.
[00:30:01.941 --> 00:30:03.562]  If they run away, they look guilty.
[00:30:03.942 --> 00:30:08.905]  And we have been doing an incredible job asking politicians the hard questions, and they run away.
[00:30:08.985 --> 00:30:14.729]  And we show that we are right, because we have the truth on our side, we have love on our side, and nothing can stop us.
[00:30:15.109 --> 00:30:17.991]  And we're doing an incredible job, and we're asking everybody to get involved.
[00:30:18.252 --> 00:30:19.132]  The time is now.
[00:30:19.512 --> 00:30:23.375]  I mean, right now, we have everybody calling for a new world order with Barack Obama.
[00:30:23.695 --> 00:30:25.216]  Even the UN.
[00:30:25.516 --> 00:30:27.117]  I mean, excuse me, the European Union.
[00:30:28.484 --> 00:30:29.205]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:29.265 --> 00:30:33.589]  Called for a new world order with Barack Obama, and that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[00:30:33.629 --> 00:30:34.931]  We have to resist their tyranny.
[00:30:34.951 --> 00:30:38.214]  We have to resist their new world order, because it will affect us.
[00:30:38.274 --> 00:30:39.375]  It will affect our children.
[00:30:39.635 --> 00:30:42.698]  It will affect the way we live, and we have to stop it right now.
[00:30:42.979 --> 00:30:48.304]  We have to be the change we want to see in this world, and it starts with the people listening right now, believing in themselves.
[00:30:48.601 --> 00:30:51.664]  I mean, even with the people listening right now, you could change tomorrow.
[00:30:51.784 --> 00:30:54.747]  It's as simple as just being good to yourself.
[00:30:54.847 --> 00:30:57.450]  But you have to admit, you have nothing to lose.
[00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.533]  They're going to take everything we've got, like tyrants always do.
[00:31:00.813 --> 00:31:03.296]  The scum always goes to the top in a tyranny.
[00:31:03.616 --> 00:31:07.860]  The worst stuff you can imagine, and worse than that, is what they're going to do.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.882]  I mean, I'm not making any of this up, folks.
[00:31:09.922 --> 00:31:11.003]  That's what makes me flip out.
[00:31:12.465 --> 00:31:19.113]  Is that I understand what we're facing and Luke understands what we're facing and no matter how crazy you can imagine it's even crazier than that.
[00:31:19.233 --> 00:31:26.141]  I mean these people are pure scum and they will hurt us bad folks
[00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:30.265]  You know, I mean, we need to understand that slavery is the name of the game, and I am not a slave.
[00:31:31.006 --> 00:31:33.088]  But Luke, I mean, look, we are changed all over the country.
[00:31:33.488 --> 00:31:34.670]  I did see the Karl Rove video.
[00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:39.855]  I wish when the security guard walks up outside on a city street and says, turn your camera off, they did.
[00:31:40.295 --> 00:31:41.777]  Folks, nobody's allowed to tell you that.
[00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:45.181]  We've stood up to cops saying they're going to frame us with bombs if we don't turn it off.
[00:31:45.501 --> 00:31:45.981]  Luke has.
[00:31:46.041 --> 00:31:47.183]  I've gone through similar crap.
[00:31:47.583 --> 00:31:49.005]  I mean, explain that to people, Luke.
[00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:50.886]  I mean, I was Anthony and Matt.
[00:31:50.906 --> 00:31:53.748]  I was actually looking for Karl Rove all the way on the sixth floor.
[00:31:53.788 --> 00:31:55.710]  I was on the sixth floor, because he went up.
[00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.291]  I kept trying to look for him.
[00:31:57.371 --> 00:31:59.092]  I kind of evaded all the security guards.
[00:31:59.152 --> 00:32:01.154]  Matt and Anthony got grabbed by security guards.
[00:32:01.454 --> 00:32:03.055]  They got evacuated out the building.
[00:32:03.295 --> 00:32:06.578]  And as they were being evacuated out the building, they see Karl Rove in the lobby.
[00:32:06.838 --> 00:32:10.881]  And they confront Karl Rove in the lobby, and then in the garage, a little area there.
[00:32:11.181 --> 00:32:13.623]  And then afterwards, they tell him, you know, turn off your camera.
[00:32:13.663 --> 00:32:14.624]  You know, you can't film me.
[00:32:15.004 --> 00:32:22.485]  Even though it's a public street, and thank God Anthony did not turn off the cameras, and they had no real grievance against them, and they let them go.
[00:32:22.545 --> 00:32:23.846]  It's a form of intimidation.
[00:32:23.906 --> 00:32:24.846]  It's a scare tactic.
[00:32:25.146 --> 00:32:26.246]  They're trying to get us scared.
[00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:27.486]  They're trying to get us intimidated.
[00:32:27.726 --> 00:32:31.627]  But whatever you do, don't ever turn off your camera in a public street.
[00:32:31.667 --> 00:32:38.308]  They will try to set you up, and the power that this little video camera has is incredible, because it shows everything.
[00:32:38.848 --> 00:32:42.189]  It exposes criminals, and that's why we have to use
[00:32:42.762 --> 00:32:43.423]  I don't think so.
[00:32:59.722 --> 00:33:01.564]  Because there's nothing to lose.
[00:33:02.264 --> 00:33:03.445]  There's only freedom to gain.
[00:33:03.485 --> 00:33:05.667]  There's only things that we could better ourselves with.
[00:33:05.707 --> 00:33:06.667]  Absolutely.
[00:33:06.687 --> 00:33:08.409]  Luke, you're also working on a new film.
[00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:10.450]  We'll certainly have you on to promote that.
[00:33:10.631 --> 00:33:13.433]  And just as things develop, we're going to be here supporting you.
[00:33:13.473 --> 00:33:16.515]  Folks, go to WeAreChange.org or find out chapters around the world.
[00:33:16.735 --> 00:33:17.816]  How many chapters now, Luke?
[00:33:18.336 --> 00:33:29.365]  We have about 74 chapters all around the world and all throughout the United States of America doing what we're doing in New York City, confronting politicians everywhere they go, in their cities, in their towns,
[00:33:29.878 --> 00:33:30.198]  I don't know.
[00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:49.493]  And it's just incredible seeing this movement grow.
[00:33:49.713 --> 00:33:52.094]  This movement is not dead, like a lot of people say.
[00:33:52.134 --> 00:33:52.614]  It's not.
[00:33:53.034 --> 00:33:58.176]  It has more life than ever, and this is our biggest opportunity to do the best work that we can.
[00:33:58.497 --> 00:34:00.017]  And right now, we have the best chances.
[00:34:00.097 --> 00:34:00.818]  Let's get out there.
[00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:01.158]  Let's do it.
[00:34:01.178 --> 00:34:01.878]  Well, I mean, look, look.
[00:34:01.938 --> 00:34:05.379]  I mean, even responding, all the enemy operatives get up and say, 9-11, truth's dead.
[00:34:05.419 --> 00:34:06.780]  We've been saying that for seven years.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.721]  And it just gets bigger and bigger.
[00:34:08.761 --> 00:34:10.782]  More confrontations, more issues.
[00:34:10.802 --> 00:34:15.023]  You know, just anybody that says that, you know they're an operative right away.
[00:34:15.343 --> 00:34:16.124]  Luke, great having you.
[00:34:17.102 --> 00:34:19.344]  Yeah, I mean, how many people did we have at Ground Zero this year?
[00:34:19.364 --> 00:34:24.630]  We had more people this year at Ground Zero than we did in 07, than we did in 06 the first year.
[00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:32.478]  And this movement is growing, and the people who say it's that, it's basically a sign of trying to depress us, trying to make people not involved.
[00:34:32.518 --> 00:34:34.320]  This movement is more alive than ever.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:41.143]  Look, look, we're going to defeat the New World Order because they're going to keep committing more and more crimes, and no amount of propaganda is going to fix it.
[00:34:41.463 --> 00:34:43.104]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:34:43.144 --> 00:34:44.444]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:34:44.884 --> 00:34:50.547]  All the New World Order's horses and all the New World Order's men couldn't put their scumbag, big, fat New World Order pedophile back together again.
[00:34:50.987 --> 00:34:52.127]  And, you know, it's over for them.
[00:34:52.347 --> 00:34:53.588]  Luke, good talking to you, my friend.
[00:34:54.168 --> 00:34:55.229]  Thanks for having me on, man.
[00:34:55.569 --> 00:34:55.870]  You bet.
[00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:56.170]  Take care.
[00:35:07.757 --> 00:35:12.100]  I've really dropped the ball in a way on these shows the last few days, just taking calls and ranting and raving.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.022]  But we've also, it's been very important, you know, very informative radio.
[00:35:15.802 --> 00:35:21.706]  But there's all these articles in the Boston Globe and Fox News and Europe and the Telegraph.
[00:35:22.367 --> 00:35:24.608]  Obama urged to create new world order.
[00:35:24.688 --> 00:35:26.970]  Obama urged to create new economic world order.
[00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:30.692]  Obama urged to shape new economic order run by the banks.
[00:35:30.872 --> 00:35:31.973]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:35:32.373 --> 00:35:35.856]  European Union, Barack Obama will bring new era of international cooperation.
[00:35:35.896 --> 00:35:36.796]  That means selling the U.S.
[00:35:36.856 --> 00:35:37.617]  out to the foreign banks.
[00:35:38.278 --> 00:35:40.819]  Stocks plunge anew as recession fears resurface.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:52.068]  I meant to check where the stocks are before we end this transmission because that is very, very important.
[00:35:52.989 --> 00:35:54.490]  I'll check that during the break and tell everybody.
[00:35:55.331 --> 00:36:00.835]  Also, holiday outlook gloomier after week October sales.
[00:36:01.536 --> 00:36:04.438]  Will Democrats tinker with mutual funds 401k plans?
[00:36:04.478 --> 00:36:05.379]  That's out of CNBC.
[00:36:08.516 --> 00:36:14.999]  And it openly says that they're looking at taking your money and making you invest it in the stock market.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.381]  Yeah, they're just going to rape everything.
[00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:19.281]  There's no end to it.
[00:36:20.102 --> 00:36:22.043]  But you've got a cowardly population, so what's going to happen?
[00:36:24.064 --> 00:36:25.044]  It goes on from here.
[00:36:25.104 --> 00:36:29.306]  I mentioned Obama's first appointment as son of a Zionist terrorist who freaks out with steak knives.
[00:36:30.147 --> 00:36:32.948]  Tax hikes, budget cuts, and works for New York City.
[00:36:32.988 --> 00:36:36.350]  Bloomberg says proposed property tax rebate is off the table.
[00:36:37.216 --> 00:36:43.778]  And he says they're going to increase property taxes by 15% and they're going to fire a thousand cops.
[00:36:46.918 --> 00:36:49.099]  Man, it's just on and on and on.
[00:36:50.059 --> 00:36:51.259]  It's going to happen everywhere too.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:52.960]  Tax hikes!
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.901]  Because all the money basically is now just for debt.
[00:36:56.341 --> 00:36:57.441]  It's all about the raping.
[00:36:57.661 --> 00:36:59.161]  We'll have nothing like a third world country.
[00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:00.862]  Everything we have goes right to the bankers.
[00:37:01.222 --> 00:37:02.562]  If you don't like it, the SWAT team will drop by.
[00:37:08.587 --> 00:37:11.889]  Obama draft star studded shortlist for cabinet.
[00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.429]  This is out of NBC New York.
[00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.470]  NBCNewYork.com.
[00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:16.551]  I meant to get into this today.
[00:37:17.031 --> 00:37:18.511]  I mean, the people he is tapping.
[00:37:19.252 --> 00:37:28.036]  I mean, you talk about Schwarzenegger as the energies are running around taking over all of the plants.
[00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:30.597]  He was involved with Enron stealing all that money.
[00:37:31.517 --> 00:37:33.498]  And then he got into office in the name of fighting it.
[00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:34.439]  It's so sick.
[00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:37.220]  And no, I'm not for Gray Davis, you buffoons.
[00:37:39.216 --> 00:37:40.277]  Oh, man.
[00:37:40.657 --> 00:37:41.657]  I'm in a really nasty mood.
[00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:42.198]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:45.319]  Some of the other news.
[00:37:45.359 --> 00:37:47.801]  Troops hope Obama brings them home as Commander-in-Chief.
[00:37:48.941 --> 00:37:49.522]  No troops.
[00:37:49.642 --> 00:37:53.183]  You're not going to be brought home, but they'll have newscasts showing a few troops that are brought home.
[00:37:53.444 --> 00:37:54.584]  They're going to depoliticize it.
[00:37:54.624 --> 00:37:55.745]  You're basically never coming home.
[00:37:56.045 --> 00:37:56.705]  Roll your sleeve up.
[00:37:56.725 --> 00:37:58.046]  They have a special vaccine for you, by the way.
[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.161]  Be sure to take it, because the government loves you.
[00:38:00.701 --> 00:38:01.361]  Everything's fine.
[00:38:02.462 --> 00:38:05.683]  BBC shunned me for denying climate change.
[00:38:05.703 --> 00:38:13.827]  One of their top presenters, David Bellamy, for decades, was told, well, you're not going to say global warming is real.
[00:38:13.847 --> 00:38:17.489]  You're not going to say that plants, that carbon dioxide is toxic waste.
[00:38:17.609 --> 00:38:18.690]  You're basically fired.
[00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:20.811]  All part of the freedom.
[00:38:21.311 --> 00:38:27.974]  Guardians of the unborn, the Dutch Parliament is considering whether protecting unborn children should supersede the rights of parents to procreate.
[00:38:28.988 --> 00:38:34.930]  And they say they're protecting the rights of the children by not letting them have children.
[00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:42.352]  And that they're going to put people on drugs that basically sterilize them.
[00:38:42.812 --> 00:38:46.013]  But then the spin is, oh, we're going to give you super rights.
[00:38:46.834 --> 00:38:48.294]  Your genetics are bad.
[00:38:48.934 --> 00:38:50.155]  You have a predisposition.
[00:38:50.635 --> 00:38:51.775]  You can't have children.
[00:38:52.436 --> 00:38:54.476]  And see, now it's the eugenics.
[00:38:55.577 --> 00:38:56.537]  Part of the freedom.
[00:38:58.174 --> 00:39:04.880]  Government black boxes will collect every email on the Independent, and the government admits every email, every phone call goes through their NSA system.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.660]  We already have it here.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.884]  They're just announcing it to their slaves there and letting you know everything you do is red.
[00:39:10.645 --> 00:39:11.525]  Because it's freedom!
[00:39:11.906 --> 00:39:13.247]  Because we're a criminal government!
[00:39:14.028 --> 00:39:15.209]  And it's not just the Parliament.
[00:39:15.229 --> 00:39:17.891]  The Parliament is spied on and has no rights and runs nothing.
[00:39:18.892 --> 00:39:19.432]  That's admitted.
[00:39:20.153 --> 00:39:23.796]  They have agents that spy from the Executive, which is controlled by the Queen.
[00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:33.027]  But then the Queen owns a bunch of TV companies that put out shows making fun of her to make it look like she's weak and pathetic.
[00:39:33.067 --> 00:39:33.747]  Did you know that?
[00:39:33.767 --> 00:39:38.529]  They own most of the big tabloids and the video companies that only get the access to them.
[00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:42.571]  And then they make themselves look buffoonish to fool the idiot public.
[00:39:43.311 --> 00:39:44.231]  Very sophisticated.
[00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:45.272]  Very sophisticated.
[00:39:47.813 --> 00:39:50.534]  Putin may return to Kremlin in a 2009 report.
[00:39:53.965 --> 00:39:55.527]  More corruption over there.
[00:39:55.967 --> 00:39:57.348]  A plea for more research.
[00:39:58.008 --> 00:39:58.389]  Cash.
[00:39:58.449 --> 00:40:00.530]  As two billion bees die from rampant disease.
[00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:01.230]  London Telegraph.
[00:40:01.551 --> 00:40:03.552]  They know what's killing the bees.
[00:40:04.473 --> 00:40:04.973]  They know.
[00:40:06.894 --> 00:40:10.197]  It's the aluminum dioxide they're spraying out of the aircraft for the now admitted
[00:40:10.957 --> 00:40:12.118]  I'm going to skip this break too.
[00:40:12.878 --> 00:40:16.140]  I'm going to keep talking even though we're not on the AM and FM because this is too important.
[00:40:36.343 --> 00:40:37.164]  See, that's the thing.
[00:40:37.525 --> 00:40:50.740]  The establishment is busy butchering the environment, genetically engineering, splicing everything, killing things, burning things, murdering animals, the whole species, all sorts of scams, corruption.
[00:40:51.001 --> 00:40:52.583]  They could care less about the environment.
[00:40:52.603 --> 00:40:55.065]  In fact, I've talked to a lot of globalists
[00:40:56.281 --> 00:41:00.843]  And I've read their publications and they say there is no unnatural genetic mutation.
[00:41:00.883 --> 00:41:03.325]  There is no unnatural thing.
[00:41:03.485 --> 00:41:08.968]  Anything we do as humans is an expression of evolution.
[00:41:09.588 --> 00:41:11.429]  And so if we kill the whole Earth, it's beautiful.
[00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:16.452]  And they say it's a normal part of evolution that machines take over.
[00:41:16.492 --> 00:41:19.175]  It's a normal part of evolution that the honeybees die.
[00:41:19.735 --> 00:41:29.883]  That any chemicals or biologicals that they put out that kill animals, or, and I've talked to people that work for IBM and others, and I'll say, but what about genetic engineering, cross-species, part human, part animal, clones?
[00:41:30.184 --> 00:41:31.204]  You know, what about human rights?
[00:41:31.224 --> 00:41:32.305]  What about that dangerous precedent?
[00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:35.388]  And they go, there is no abnormal mutation.
[00:41:36.345 --> 00:41:37.446]  There is no morals.
[00:41:37.786 --> 00:41:40.787]  But then they'll tell you, the public, the morals for the Earth.
[00:41:40.848 --> 00:41:43.109]  Carbon dioxide is deadly.
[00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:45.710]  We've got to ban it and restrict it.
[00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.151]  It's involved in all manufacturing.
[00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.172]  It's what humans exhale.
[00:41:48.492 --> 00:41:49.712]  All the rammels exhale it.
[00:41:50.293 --> 00:41:50.933]  That's a way to regulate.
[00:41:50.953 --> 00:41:52.434]  They say they're going to tax you for breathing.
[00:41:52.474 --> 00:41:53.495]  That's a New York Times headline.
[00:41:53.915 --> 00:41:56.516]  So see, oh my God, the carbon dioxide is so deadly.
[00:41:56.556 --> 00:41:58.798]  The Earth, the polar bears are drowning.
[00:41:58.838 --> 00:41:59.738]  They can't swim.
[00:41:59.758 --> 00:42:00.979]  I mean, knowing.
[00:42:02.099 --> 00:42:03.500]  Just total insult to the public.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.561]  All those naturalists.
[00:42:04.801 --> 00:42:06.622]  Look at them.
[00:42:06.642 --> 00:42:07.662]  They're stuck on the ice floe.
[00:42:07.943 --> 00:42:08.403]  They'll die.
[00:42:08.743 --> 00:42:09.584]  Our cubs won't make it.
[00:42:09.924 --> 00:42:10.564]  They can't swim.
[00:42:11.465 --> 00:42:12.925]  On all the shows I saw on TV this week.
[00:42:13.146 --> 00:42:13.966]  I never even watched TV.
[00:42:14.666 --> 00:42:16.207]  Polar bears can swim again 300 miles.
[00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:17.528]  They hunt on ice floes.
[00:42:17.908 --> 00:42:18.408]  Doesn't matter.
[00:42:18.529 --> 00:42:19.549]  They think of you as idiots.
[00:42:19.709 --> 00:42:20.810]  They think of you as scum.
[00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.030]  They think of you as trash.
[00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.471]  And believe me, you act like it, a lot of you.
[00:42:23.831 --> 00:42:26.293]  I'm talking to our general audience, but some of the people out there that love to be lied to.
[00:42:27.642 --> 00:42:35.065]  And so again, oh my god, the earth, carbon dioxide, we've got to take over people's farms and ranches and we've got to fine and fee everybody, the earth, the earth.
[00:42:35.305 --> 00:42:40.867]  See, they pick something that has nothing to do with hurting the environment so that it doesn't affect any of their dirty industries.
[00:42:41.367 --> 00:42:53.351]  Then they take the whole environmental movement that people are concerned about and then they take all of our energy for a good environment and put it into setting up a world government and tattletale squads and feudalism and regulation and control.
[00:42:53.992 --> 00:42:54.552]  Meanwhile,
[00:42:55.936 --> 00:42:58.077]  GMO crops are killing animals everywhere.
[00:42:58.197 --> 00:43:02.300]  Birds, populations worldwide, wherever GMO crops are, are dying out.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:14.828]  Animals, fish, the hormones in the water that we secrete from drinking the plastics are making the fish and the frogs, in some areas, 80-90% of them, you know, are bisexual or don't have sexual organs.
[00:43:15.288 --> 00:43:16.309]  It's killing the humans.
[00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:19.791]  All this real environmental degradation, and they go, oh, that's nothing.
[00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:22.993]  And they're about to get total immunity in the US and England and Europe.
[00:43:23.453 --> 00:43:25.818]  To all drug makers, they can kill us with whatever they want.
[00:43:25.838 --> 00:43:26.900]  They can try to make us take it.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:27.922]  It doesn't matter.
[00:43:27.982 --> 00:43:30.467]  It's just total takeover, evil at every level.
[00:43:30.727 --> 00:43:31.529]  Let's go back live.
[00:43:39.537 --> 00:43:42.381]  The New World Order is a giant psycho palace.
[00:43:43.203 --> 00:43:51.696]  Psychopaths creating a wonderland to torture and kill and genetically engineer and kill wildlife and kill species and re-engineer the biosphere.
[00:43:51.856 --> 00:43:53.859]  And they say there's no such thing as a real mutation.
[00:43:54.684 --> 00:43:56.285]  I mean, as a false mutation.
[00:43:56.605 --> 00:43:58.446]  They say it's great the honeybees are dying.
[00:43:58.486 --> 00:44:02.429]  It's great that the GMO foods are killing masses of humans and other animals.
[00:44:03.449 --> 00:44:06.691]  Horses won't drink fluorinated water, but they force them to until they die.
[00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:08.252]  They give us the fluoride water.
[00:44:09.032 --> 00:44:10.814]  Billions and billions of bees dying.
[00:44:10.854 --> 00:44:13.735]  An entire area is not even having the flowers being pollinated.
[00:44:14.376 --> 00:44:17.477]  And meanwhile, they've got us ready to ban CO2 that plants breathe.
[00:44:19.699 --> 00:44:22.120]  This is the reality of what we face, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.381]  I'm not kidding about any of it.
[00:44:25.151 --> 00:44:29.536]  You know what, I meant to get to all this news, but it's all up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:44:29.837 --> 00:44:31.959]  And folks, I can't even describe how bad it is.
[00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:34.442]  As bad as I'm making it sound, it's a hundred times worse.
[00:44:34.502 --> 00:44:34.843]  It's just...
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:45:00.798]  We have been in this incrementally, with it slowly being turned up around us, and everything looks like it's okay, but your neighbors' kids are being kidnapped, your neighbor's dying of cancer, all this stuff's going on, people are dying, people have all these health problems, the kids are all turning to demons watching TV, everything's falling apart, the economy's imploding, there's militarized hate cops everywhere, brainwashed yuppies scampering around, brainwashed Obama worshippers hopping around.
[00:45:02.432 --> 00:45:02.772]  You know what?
[00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:03.893]  I said I'd go to some phone calls.
[00:45:04.293 --> 00:45:05.033]  Who's up next here?
[00:45:05.673 --> 00:45:06.794]  Joe in Los Angeles.
[00:45:06.894 --> 00:45:07.614]  Joe in LA.
[00:45:07.634 --> 00:45:08.274]  You're on the air.
[00:45:08.314 --> 00:45:08.635]  Welcome.
[00:45:10.395 --> 00:45:15.257]  So, I want to thank you for everything you've been doing and Luke Rudowsky and all the guys and everybody in the 9-1-1 Truth Movement.
[00:45:16.798 --> 00:45:20.760]  I was wondering if you could make a comment in regards to Cynthia McKinney's press conference last week.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.061]  I didn't see it.
[00:45:24.141 --> 00:45:28.283]  She did it September 28th at the Critical Resistance Conference in Oakland.
[00:45:28.943 --> 00:45:31.324]  She was talking about a mother of a soldier
[00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:39.185]  with the DMRT came to her saying that he was in charge... Oh yeah, I know about the thing about... Go ahead.
[00:45:39.865 --> 00:45:40.146]  I'm sorry?
[00:45:40.726 --> 00:45:41.566]  Finish the story, go ahead.
[00:45:42.307 --> 00:45:59.174]  Well, she said that the mother, her son had told her, although he had signed papers of secrecy, that he logged in four to five thousand bodies all with a single gunshot to the head during Katrina incident and she said that she has verified it through the Red Cross and sources
[00:46:00.226 --> 00:46:01.167]  uh... in the P.O.D.
[00:46:01.207 --> 00:46:04.588]  that they have a cataloged or uh... referred to there as well.
[00:46:04.648 --> 00:46:06.089]  I know, we've been trying to get her on about that.
[00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:08.210]  I didn't know specifically which press conference you were talking about.
[00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.012]  I don't know if that is fully true, but I talk to a lot of police.
[00:46:12.032 --> 00:46:13.653]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:46:14.702 --> 00:46:15.823]  I talked to the police.
[00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:18.965]  I talked to people who have family who have police on the Texas coast.
[00:46:19.125 --> 00:46:21.567]  Thousands died, not 45 or whatever they say.
[00:46:22.027 --> 00:46:22.487]  Thousands.
[00:46:22.547 --> 00:46:25.910]  Whole dead families up in their attics that didn't go out when they were told to.
[00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:29.312]  There were a lot of looters shot.
[00:46:29.392 --> 00:46:32.334]  Police have gone to prison for shooting innocent people that were unarmed.
[00:46:32.894 --> 00:46:34.836]  They did kill hundreds of people.
[00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:37.517]  They did kill some of them execution style.
[00:46:37.938 --> 00:46:40.700]  Mainly they just sprayed them with machine gun fire.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.622]  I don't know about 5,000, but I put nothing past them now.
[00:46:45.662 --> 00:46:54.486]  We know that was a laboratory to test, to send in troops under FBI command to go into the even wealthy areas that were high and dry and take the guns.
[00:46:54.526 --> 00:46:55.466]  They were never given back.
[00:46:57.387 --> 00:46:59.308]  But I don't know about 5,000 killed.
[00:46:59.708 --> 00:47:08.232]  I know they did practice corrupting the troops and police under FBI, Homeland Security, NORTHCOM command in stealing property and looting and raping women.
[00:47:09.212 --> 00:47:15.134]  Uh, in, uh, not giving people their property back, in gun confiscation, and in covering up hundreds they murdered.
[00:47:16.014 --> 00:47:23.135]  Uh, but a few people, like public machine gunning of families on bridges, and the cops lied and claimed they had guns, that turned out that wasn't true.
[00:47:23.916 --> 00:47:32.018]  Mainly what happened is you'd have troops looting and killing, as they always do, and then they would run into other cops looting and killing with the military, and then they would have little shootouts with each other.
[00:47:32.038 --> 00:47:37.999]  So you also had a lot of, and then they would throw fits after a friendly fire and just fly over with helicopters and just shoot people.
[00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:40.331]  Because, you know, that's what demons do.
[00:47:40.351 --> 00:47:42.574]  After they kill each other, they have a little celebration murder.
[00:47:43.935 --> 00:47:44.636]  That's quite normal.
[00:47:44.656 --> 00:47:50.402]  Troops have mass rapings and burnings and killings, and they froth and kill each other, too, and argue over loot and booty.
[00:47:50.902 --> 00:47:51.523]  Oh, we're out of time?
[00:47:51.583 --> 00:47:52.464]  Another happy program?
[00:47:54.266 --> 00:47:55.407]  Welcome to my brain, folks.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:58.370]  Welcome to the stuff I know is going on, the things I'm freaked out about.
[00:47:59.523 --> 00:48:01.265]  And I'm going to stay here in the U.S.
[00:48:01.325 --> 00:48:05.010]  and fight until the end, but you're going to have to hear me flip out on air because this stuff is flipping me out.
[00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.333]  All right, we had a bunch of key guests on today.
[00:48:07.413 --> 00:48:10.537]  The first hour was focused and it starts at Infowars.com right now.
[00:48:10.997 --> 00:48:11.298]  Bye-bye.
[00:48:11.698 --> 00:48:13.060]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:13.961]  Oh my God.
[00:48:15.503 --> 00:48:16.204]  Good show, Jones.
