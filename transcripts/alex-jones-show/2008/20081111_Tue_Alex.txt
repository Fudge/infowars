[00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:11.053]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the fourth hour every day we go live for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:17.078]  We also do a lot of behind the scenes stuff with PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and the InfoWars.com stream listeners.
[00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.621]  I do want to tell you we've got some really big guests who are lined up later in the week.
[00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:22.920]  That we have lined up.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.782]  I'm a bit under the weather, so put up with me.
[00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:28.964]  I'm a little bit more sluggish than normal.
[00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:32.848]  Just a program note, people are wondering why I sound different.
[00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:38.512]  Got a lot of news I want to go over, but first I want to get all these great callers out of the way.
[00:00:38.532 --> 00:00:42.135]  We've been holding like Herb and Fred and Steve, Jason, Chris, Michelle and others.
[00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:45.698]  Then I'm going to play a CNBC clip.
[00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:56.629]  Where they are talking about how statins are so wonderful and how even if you have regular cholesterol, all cholesterol is bad.
[00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.651]  We need to put cholesterol in the water, put statin in the water so that you don't drink the evil cholesterol.
[00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:03.931]  That's one clip.
[00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:12.954]  And there's another great YouTube clip, a compilation of clips with doctors and scientists that will play here also at PrisonPlanet.tv so everybody
[00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:16.975]  You can check that out coming up later in the hour.
[00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:32.961]  But for those that just joined us, in the last three hours I covered the PrisonPlanet.com story by Paul Watson, reporting from Bloomberg and AP and others, that $2 trillion of the $5 trillion, $5 trillion has been put out.
[00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:34.981]  And we've got links to the mainstream admitting that.
[00:01:35.782 --> 00:01:41.484]  But $2 trillion of it, the Federal Reserve is saying, we're not even going to tell you where the taxpayer money went.
[00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:42.544]  That is secret.
[00:01:44.144 --> 00:01:51.926]  Now if that isn't just corruption beyond anything imaginable in your face, I don't know what is, but we kept telling people that was in the Banker Takeover Bill.
[00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:59.967]  That bill wasn't even so much about the money as it was about the new emperor-like, god-like financial power.
[00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:06.809]  This gave the private Federal Reserve to do whatever it wants with the Treasury Department and for it to be secret.
[00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.812]  And so they are raping us big time right now.
[00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:13.437]  Also, we've read multiple reports here for you with the quotes.
[00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:19.865]  Democrat 401k confiscation proposal is Republican mandatory savings plan.
[00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:23.489]  Both parties together saying they are going to tax
[00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.590]  Hey, Alex.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.040]  Hi.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.422]  Proud Prison Planet TV member.
[00:02:57.642 --> 00:02:58.002]  Thank you.
[00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:05.105]  And you know, Alex, I want to pick up on something you said in Martial Law 9-11 rise of the police state.
[00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:13.628]  And this... I'm going to look into the mind of a psycho in this coup detective general public that we have here.
[00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:23.532]  As an absolute statement of fact, we've been under Martial Law since 1913 with the construction of the Federal Reserve Bank and the Internal Revenue Service.
[00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:37.645]  Now, if you look at this capstone that you revealed to us, the Bilderberg Group crap on the private central bankers and the Council on Foreign Relations and the empty shirt politicians who are basically controlled by the military-industrial complex.
[00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:43.908]  Our economy is tied up in war that benefits the military-industrial complex, period.
[00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.689]  Alex?
[00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.449]  Yes, sir.
[00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.430]  I'm just listening to you here.
[00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.871]  You're absolutely right.
[00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:58.738]  It's just absolutely horrible what we're facing, and they sell the public to get involved in the evil.
[00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:04.522]  They say, yeah, war is good for the economy, it's good for the people, so go ahead and go along with it.
[00:04:05.062 --> 00:04:06.023]  We've got to make money.
[00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:08.204]  But it costs the people money.
[00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:15.588]  There are so many yuppies and people who have bought into war and evil, and yeah, we need that oil from Iraq.
[00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.770]  You're not getting that oil from Iraq, folks.
[00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.132]  Sounds like you've got more to say, Herb, and you're right on.
[00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:24.112]  You want to add some points after the break?
[00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:25.393]  Yes, I do.
[00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:29.975]  Okay, I want to hear from you and everybody else, and I'm going to try to sit back and let folks roll.
[00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:37.899]  I'm going to take a lot of calls in this hour, and we've got some key video clips as well coming up, so please stay with us.
[00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:38.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:41.222]  Okay, John, I'm going to skip this break.
[00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:43.183]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:47.546]  And I'm going to keep talking with Herb, and then we go back to the full audience.
[00:04:47.826 --> 00:04:55.051]  You're just on the web right now, but I don't want to waste any time, Herb, here in the fourth hour as we strive to skip most of the breaks here.
[00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:56.432]  Please continue.
[00:04:58.093 --> 00:05:02.616]  I made a statement on satellite radio last February, and I said this.
[00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:06.779]  America, as we once knew it or her, ceased to exist
[00:05:07.443 --> 00:05:12.247]  In the year 2000, with the Bush-Nazi crime families coup d'etat down in Florida.
[00:05:12.827 --> 00:05:26.237]  And I said the so-called way forward, which is what I was talking about, the Iraq surge, is coming from the Federal Reserve Bankers, the Council on Foreign Relations, and all of the devotees of the Bush-Nazi crime families New World Order.
[00:05:26.898 --> 00:05:29.800]  Our global government, global economy, global media, global religion.
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.145]  If Barack Obama is not stopped from entering the White House as an illegal alien,
[00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:46.807]  This plan of the New World Order and the New Age Movement is going to be escalated, it's going to be put on steroids, and I hope you'll let me make my last comment about the Fed protest coming up the 22nd of this month.
[00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.799]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:05:49.859 --> 00:06:06.604]  Genesis has run ads for the folks that are doing that, Gary Franchi, and I even was the one that recommended to Ted that he do that, and then I get emails saying I haven't been plugging in enough, so I can't do it all, but absolutely.
[00:06:06.904 --> 00:06:07.284]  I heard it.
[00:06:07.324 --> 00:06:07.524]  Sure.
[00:06:07.824 --> 00:06:13.066]  Let's come back to the full audience here in about a minute and a half and plug the
[00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:16.047]  The Fed protests nationwide.
[00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:25.154]  I think that's important because, again, it draws attention to who the real bad guys are, instead of the diversion, the distraction, Barack Obama, John McCain.
[00:06:28.382 --> 00:06:35.746]  I don't want to say that I got sucker-punched, but I really wanted to like Barack Obama, but he snuck up on people.
[00:06:35.806 --> 00:06:37.266]  He said, oh, I'm going to end the war.
[00:06:37.327 --> 00:06:38.947]  Oh, I'm not going to have warrantless wiretapping.
[00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:46.391]  And I remember Jesse Ventura and Willie Nelson and everybody else on here like nine months ago saying, maybe he's good.
[00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:53.655]  And then as soon as he got people's confidence, he just turned around and said, I'm going back on all of that.
[00:06:54.695 --> 00:07:03.745]  But the general public has now wedded themselves to him, just like Republicans did to Bush, and so they're now going to go along with whatever he does.
[00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:10.112]  And so I want to hear you speak to Barack Obama and his presidency, and why specifically
[00:07:10.652 --> 00:07:12.753]  You say he's going to help bring in this whole agenda.
[00:07:13.094 --> 00:07:14.555]  I happen to totally agree with you.
[00:07:14.815 --> 00:07:19.358]  The carbon tax, I mean, if people don't think our economy's already screwed up, wait till you see this.
[00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:21.179]  The banker's looting everything.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.923]  And so that's why, more than ever, we've got to expose the fact that the Federal Reserve is the problem.
[00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:42.036]  And this protest coming up on the 22nd of this month is so important, so we'll talk about that with you, Herb, when we get back, and then go to Fred, Steven, Jason, Chris, Michelle, and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:07:42.076 --> 00:07:42.477]  Here we go.
[00:07:43.898 --> 00:07:46.701]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:56.067]  Everything else is window dressing.
[00:07:56.628 --> 00:07:59.514]  Talking about Barack Obama, the big media event.
[00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:01.779]  Talking about Sarah Palin still.
[00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:03.402]  They're puppets, they run nothing.
[00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:06.184]  And the Federal Reserve is the issue.
[00:08:06.204 --> 00:08:13.728]  The private banks that are raping us, that don't want a free market, that don't want a real economy, that don't want our families to be strong.
[00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:24.954]  I see all these women and men on TV saying, my problems are all solved, the one has arrived, the savior, the president of the world, the president of the planet, the savior.
[00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:28.916]  Meanwhile, his whole agenda is a new world order.
[00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:30.817]  Finishing up what you were saying, Herb,
[00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:38.560]  The gospel minister, about 30 years, is getting to the point where I can't talk to anybody but Alex Jones, but you know what?
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.722]  I take what God gives me.
[00:08:40.122 --> 00:08:41.724]  I want to pull the covers off the beast.
[00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:48.190]  November 22, 1963, the last real president that we had was gunned down, publicly executed.
[00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:56.498]  November 22, 2008, 45 years later, Alex, we got the immovable object, is getting ready to meet the irresistible force
[00:08:57.049 --> 00:08:59.511]  And you know about the protest in 38th City?
[00:08:59.711 --> 00:09:01.213]  Alex, what I'm saying is this, buddy.
[00:09:01.653 --> 00:09:06.257]  Something is going to have to give, and there's absolutely no mention in the media.
[00:09:06.617 --> 00:09:14.424]  They are enamored with this Barack Obama clown, which, as you say, prophetically, is nothing but a puppet.
[00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:21.450]  And if you look at the compartmentalization of the New Age movement, the New World Order, rather,
[00:09:22.257 --> 00:09:24.298]  He is being crapped on by the private central bank.
[00:09:24.318 --> 00:09:25.559]  He's going along with everything.
[00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:28.881]  Like you say, he's going back on the wiretapping.
[00:09:28.941 --> 00:09:31.103]  He's going to go back on everything.
[00:09:31.323 --> 00:09:35.525]  And the people who are going to be most affected are all these people who are walking around talking about, yes, we can.
[00:09:35.545 --> 00:09:37.547]  What they should be saying is, what we want.
[00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:38.467]  And you know what?
[00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:43.270]  I am sick and tired of all of this New Age, New World Order crap.
[00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.631]  And I'm just like you, buddy.
[00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:45.792]  I got my powder dry.
[00:09:45.992 --> 00:09:46.552]  But you know what?
[00:09:46.592 --> 00:09:49.274]  The crap's going to hit the fan, and I'm going to be ready.
[00:09:49.895 --> 00:09:51.559]  God bless you, good to hear from you.
[00:09:51.659 --> 00:09:56.269]  In fact, there's so many guest ideas I have on air that I never telegraph them to Trey.
[00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:58.373]  Before I forget this...
[00:09:59.454 --> 00:10:01.775]  Tell him to go set up Gary Franchi, the Lone Lantern Society.
[00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:03.555]  I think he's the one heading up that Fed thing.
[00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:04.535]  I can't tell.
[00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:05.536]  He's got so many websites.
[00:10:06.116 --> 00:10:08.757]  I know I've linked to it and plugged it, and Genesis has a link up to it.
[00:10:09.737 --> 00:10:12.358]  But, yeah, that's a great idea.
[00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:19.139]  On the anniversary of when the Federal Reserve murdered JFK, people should protest the Fed.
[00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:28.582]  In fact, they've got a Federal Reserve up in Dallas, and I'm going to be up there for the JFK Memorial anyways, making a documentary, so I'm going to be at that.
[00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:39.638]  And I hope to see folks out there at the Dallas event and at the other Fed banks around the country.
[00:10:40.078 --> 00:10:41.219]  There's 30-something of them.
[00:10:42.881 --> 00:10:44.642]  There's 12 major regional banks.
[00:10:45.863 --> 00:10:47.565]  They've got offices in Mints all over.
[00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:50.707]  Hopefully I won't run into Michelle Malkin again or anything.
[00:10:51.808 --> 00:10:55.211]  Let's go ahead and go to Fred in Philly.
[00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:56.512]  Fred, you're on the air.
[00:10:57.569 --> 00:10:59.530]  Alex, this is one of the best shows you've had.
[00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:20.756]  You've covered the news very well, and I just want to say that on the issue of the Bloomberg News suit versus the Fed, I dug around, even though the government's closed, and I've got the docket number for that, and I would advise people get a hard copy of that before it's dismissed or sealed.
[00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:21.797]  08-CV-9595.
[00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:32.164]  Okay, that's 08-CV-9595, and where is that filed?
[00:11:32.184 --> 00:11:32.224]  U.S.
[00:11:32.744 --> 00:11:34.805]  District Court, District of New York.
[00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:43.109]  Hey, do me a favor, email that to Aaron at InfoWars.com, and we'll copy it and put it in our format and post it right now.
[00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:52.332]  Yeah, and I just want to say... Well, for those that don't know, though, and I know I'm interrupting, you've been holding a while, tell them what the lawsuit deals with, because new listeners every second.
[00:11:53.373 --> 00:11:54.413]  Well, you mentioned
[00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:58.551]  The cause of action, I don't have that in front of me.
[00:11:58.611 --> 00:12:09.178]  It's two trillion dollars plus has gone to the private Federal Reserve and they're saying we're not going to let the media or Congress know who it was given to, that it's secret.
[00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:17.363]  And our right to know under the law, under the bailout legislation and the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:12:18.754 --> 00:12:21.435]  Well, you watch, it's going to get thrown out because I read that bill.
[00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:27.338]  It has all this language about how it's going to be transparent, unless the Treasury Secretary says no.
[00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:40.705]  Well, I find it interesting that the Board of Governors is in Washington, but this suit is filed in New York, and I don't know what the target is.
[00:12:40.725 --> 00:12:42.645]  Is it the Federal Reserve Bank of New York?
[00:12:43.046 --> 00:12:47.928]  Because that would indicate that that one organization has more power than
[00:12:49.706 --> 00:13:03.593]  They probably did it in New York because they control the press and the media more there.
[00:13:04.493 --> 00:13:09.155]  The government is closed today, so like I said, I would try to get a hard copy.
[00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:15.358]  I can't email that at this moment, but I'm saying I would try to get a summary and a copy of that.
[00:13:16.207 --> 00:13:21.209]  And what article did you find this in?
[00:13:21.249 --> 00:13:23.070]  Bloomberg, AP, a couple others.
[00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.650]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:24.751 --> 00:13:28.012]  FedHides, destination of $2 trillion in bailout money.
[00:13:29.012 --> 00:13:30.293]  Okay, well thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:31.673]  Thank you, I appreciate your call.
[00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:32.674]  Good to hear from you, Fred.
[00:13:32.754 --> 00:13:33.794]  Stephen in Canada.
[00:13:34.134 --> 00:13:35.115]  You're on the air, Stephen.
[00:13:35.155 --> 00:13:35.495]  Welcome.
[00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:36.935]  Hi, Alex.
[00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:37.496]  How are you?
[00:13:37.736 --> 00:13:38.136]  Pretty good.
[00:13:39.604 --> 00:13:48.949]  Alex, I just want to say to you, my friend, Dennis, we respect your work and all the time you've made the people aware on your documentaries, such as Endgame.
[00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:54.792]  My question is, Alex, how big is Canada's role in the global agenda?
[00:13:54.912 --> 00:14:00.415]  I understand America's role, but Canada always seems to go under the radar in this global scam.
[00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:05.160]  The gun control, the mandatory vaccines in my country is crazy.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:16.263]  The restrictions on free speech, the people being arrested for their speech, the police harassing you, your border guards harassing your own citizens.
[00:14:16.844 --> 00:14:22.965]  Canada is one of the most tyrannical countries in the Western world, and that's not just myself.
[00:14:23.025 --> 00:14:27.827]  A lot of human rights groups have said that, but they have this nice candy coating to it
[00:14:28.487 --> 00:14:29.488]  So people aren't aware.
[00:14:29.588 --> 00:14:30.829]  It is very important.
[00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.732]  It has more resources than the United States.
[00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:36.374]  It has as many resources as Mexico.
[00:14:37.435 --> 00:14:38.776]  It is incredibly wealthy.
[00:14:39.837 --> 00:14:43.760]  And the people there are in La La Land.
[00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:45.922]  But I've looked at your laws.
[00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:47.503]  Those aren't really mandatory.
[00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:52.527]  They engage in hoaxes, claiming it's mandatory, just like here in the U.S.
[00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:52.968]  and England.
[00:14:54.008 --> 00:14:54.948]  There is no law.
[00:14:54.988 --> 00:15:01.171]  They just lie, again showing how criminal your government is, and tell you it's the law.
[00:15:01.271 --> 00:15:04.552]  But Canada is very very important in the scheme of things.
[00:15:05.973 --> 00:15:08.034]  Do they practice eugenics?
[00:15:08.647 --> 00:15:09.268]  Absolutely.
[00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:15.254]  They have euthanized, just in the last two years, whole Indian tribes have been sterilized.
[00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:16.875]  They kill the children.
[00:15:18.157 --> 00:15:21.560]  That was on CBC TV just last year.
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.962]  Well, you probably heard of it.
[00:15:22.982 --> 00:15:23.642]  It was big news.
[00:15:24.543 --> 00:15:26.325]  And yeah, they just murder them wholesale.
[00:15:26.345 --> 00:15:27.786]  They just murder the foster children.
[00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.531]  By the way listeners, don't roll your eyes.
[00:15:32.012 --> 00:15:38.757]  Go look up eugenics or Canadian government kills Indians, kills natives.
[00:15:39.658 --> 00:15:40.719]  I mean, certainly you've heard of that.
[00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:41.680]  I know it's big news up there.
[00:15:44.002 --> 00:15:46.123]  Have you heard about that, Stephen?
[00:15:47.264 --> 00:15:48.946]  Oh, I hear a lot of things up here.
[00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:53.069]  I'm also reading in my local newspaper, Alex, about sodium fluoride.
[00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:57.633]  My city in Kitchener, Waterloo, in Ontario, the province of Ontario,
[00:15:58.362 --> 00:16:01.384]  They are encouraging us to drink this dirty water.
[00:16:01.404 --> 00:16:02.805]  Because they love you.
[00:16:03.065 --> 00:16:04.506]  They care about you so much.
[00:16:04.867 --> 00:16:06.207]  It's very important you drink that.
[00:16:06.227 --> 00:16:07.148]  It's sodium fluoride.
[00:16:07.188 --> 00:16:07.769]  Very important.
[00:16:07.809 --> 00:16:10.831]  And Alex, the water is a different color, for God's sake.
[00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:11.891]  I know, I know.
[00:16:12.152 --> 00:16:13.232]  Listen, I grew up in Dallas.
[00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:14.093]  I grew up in Dallas.
[00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:18.816]  And I thought all there was, and I remember drinking water, getting a headache, brushing my teeth, getting a headache.
[00:16:19.296 --> 00:16:20.397]  And nobody told me about it.
[00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:20.958]  I didn't know.
[00:16:21.678 --> 00:16:27.800]  And then now I have this wonderful Valhalla of drinking distilled water, or reverse osmosis water, or Berkey water.
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.021]  And I've got all these different types of filtration systems.
[00:16:30.361 --> 00:16:31.741]  In my bathrooms, I've got Berkeys.
[00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:38.943]  And then I've got reverse osmosis for cooking, and I've got distilled, and I've got these generator machines.
[00:16:38.963 --> 00:16:40.824]  You wanna hear the funny part, Alex?
[00:16:41.986 --> 00:16:44.087]  They are banning bottled water.
[00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:44.907]  I know.
[00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:48.749]  It's for the earth, because you don't need that water.
[00:16:49.989 --> 00:16:55.151]  In fact, they say in San Francisco and Oregon and other areas banning in the US, you don't need that.
[00:16:55.171 --> 00:16:56.792]  The tap water is just fine for you.
[00:16:57.572 --> 00:17:03.275]  And the plastic is bad for the earth, which it is, but again it sets that precedent.
[00:17:03.695 --> 00:17:06.156]  I have articles here where they're
[00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:15.885]  Again, in England, they're going to roadside hot dog shacks and saying, you can't just sell hot dogs, you've got to sell a healthy dish.
[00:17:16.405 --> 00:17:23.868]  Now, that sounds reasonable, but think of the state power to say what you can serve or what you can eat.
[00:17:24.168 --> 00:17:27.049]  That's the power to make you take shots, make you take drugs.
[00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:28.430]  I appreciate your call.
[00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.711]  Now is a good time to play this statin clip.
[00:17:31.661 --> 00:17:33.841]  Now statins, don't believe me, Google it.
[00:17:33.942 --> 00:17:35.642]  You'll be reading government reports, industry.
[00:17:36.542 --> 00:17:37.722]  It came out in the last few years.
[00:17:37.762 --> 00:17:39.003]  Maybe you shouldn't take statins.
[00:17:39.023 --> 00:17:39.923]  They attack your heart.
[00:17:39.943 --> 00:17:40.883]  They attack your liver.
[00:17:41.383 --> 00:17:42.503]  They attack your brain.
[00:17:43.023 --> 00:17:44.964]  Your whole body is made up out of cholesterol.
[00:17:45.024 --> 00:17:50.465]  That's cholesterol and vitamin C and vitamin A bind to make your tissue, your connective tissue.
[00:17:52.806 --> 00:17:56.326]  But older women cut all the fat out of their diet and wonder why their bodies go to hell.
[00:17:56.346 --> 00:17:59.487]  Because they lose their connective tissue.
[00:18:00.888 --> 00:18:06.174]  But they are now demonizing all cholesterol.
[00:18:06.555 --> 00:18:07.756]  It's a long four-minute clip.
[00:18:07.776 --> 00:18:08.437]  We're not going to play it all.
[00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:13.322]  You can go watch it at presentplanet.com.
[00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:15.104]  What's the headline, John?
[00:18:15.124 --> 00:18:16.025]  I forget the exact headline.
[00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:21.512]  CNBC host recommends statins to be put in the water supply.
[00:18:22.423 --> 00:18:26.046]  Yes, CNBC host recommends that statins be put in water supply.
[00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:32.370]  And so they go on to tell you that the drug company says that it's good for everybody and any cholesterol in your body is bad.
[00:18:33.171 --> 00:18:36.533]  Now it's already been proven that the statins don't actually help you and actually hurt you.
[00:18:37.054 --> 00:18:38.555]  Healthy men go take them and drop dead.
[00:18:40.656 --> 00:18:42.818]  It's like they admit the HPV shot isn't good for you.
[00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:44.939]  Go ahead and play the last minute of it.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.162]  High levels of cholesterol in the blood
[00:18:49.116 --> 00:18:51.158]  Don't necessarily cause heart disease?
[00:18:51.458 --> 00:18:53.260]  Oh no, they do cause heart disease.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.486]  Now you're talking about average levels of cholesterol in the blood somehow are contributing to heart disease as well, right?
[00:18:59.706 --> 00:18:59.907]  No.
[00:19:00.227 --> 00:19:04.731]  Average levels of cholesterol, but with a high level or elevated CRP.
[00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:10.337]  If you have over two, these people in this study I think had something like a level of four.
[00:19:10.937 --> 00:19:14.358]  But the bottom line is, it's not just cholesterol that you have to be watching.
[00:19:14.538 --> 00:19:25.721]  Right, so when you go in for your blood test now, especially you, Joe, being over a certain age, you're going to say, not only check my HDL and LDL, make sure they put HSCRP in there as well.
[00:19:25.741 --> 00:19:30.202]  Why don't they just put statins in the water or something?
[00:19:30.222 --> 00:19:32.422]  A lot of people have said that, and they are in the water, in fact.
[00:19:32.682 --> 00:19:35.303]  That would be a communist plot, just like fluoride.
[00:19:40.148 --> 00:19:43.571]  Free yourself from expensive cable and satellite fees.

[00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.712]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:43.852 --> 00:20:49.054]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:20:49.254 --> 00:20:54.016]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:20:54.397 --> 00:21:05.522]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[00:21:41.803 --> 00:21:44.183]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:21:44.203 --> 00:21:46.424]  9-11 was an inside job!
[00:21:46.464 --> 00:21:48.025]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:21:48.045 --> 00:21:49.665]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:52.586]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:56.268]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[00:22:05.942 --> 00:22:10.794]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:22:14.594 --> 00:22:16.175]  How dare you?
[00:22:17.015 --> 00:22:22.078]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:22:22.098 --> 00:22:24.619]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:31.182]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9- Truth Rising.

[00:22:39.546 --> 00:22:43.188]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[00:22:43.249 --> 00:22:48.892]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:53.035]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.261]  I don't know.

[00:23:52.625 --> 00:24:21.976]  My sales guy brought me some Chinese food I hadn't eaten yet this late in the day and I dumped a bunch of this hot mustard on it and ate it and I felt like my head was going to explode the last four days but I ate a lot of hot stuff man I just poured mustard on it just eating it eyes started watering head popped I feel like a million dollars awesome
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:24.980]  Awesome!
[00:24:26.261 --> 00:24:26.902]  Oh, man!
[00:24:27.622 --> 00:24:27.823]  Mwah!
[00:24:28.803 --> 00:24:30.925]  I have gotta... I just kiss a little thing of mustard.
[00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:36.589]  I gotta start... I mean, if it comes back tomorrow or something, the sinus pressure, I'll just eat some more of this.
[00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.570]  Man, that took care of that!
[00:24:38.711 --> 00:24:38.951]  Whoo!
[00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:41.433]  Man, now I feel like Renton Raven!
[00:24:43.914 --> 00:24:45.556]  Alright, that's Mindless Talk Radio.
[00:24:45.576 --> 00:24:47.617]  Just a new little wives' tale there for you.
[00:24:48.438 --> 00:24:49.619]  But it certainly worked for me.
[00:24:51.007 --> 00:24:58.720]  Okay, we just played that clip where they're giggling and laughing about putting, um... Forgot to turn the ringer off over here.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.162]  It's like an insane asylum around here.
[00:25:00.182 --> 00:25:02.086]  Uh, we forgot to, um...
[00:25:06.089 --> 00:25:14.582]  I want to play the end of that clip, last 20 seconds again, John, from CNBC with the headline up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:25:15.343 --> 00:25:18.749]  CNBC host recommends statins be put in the water.
[00:25:19.069 --> 00:25:21.252]  Play just the end of that again so people can hear it.
[00:25:22.113 --> 00:25:29.697]  Over a certain age, you're going to say, not only check my HDL and LDL, make sure they put HSCRP in there as well.
[00:25:29.717 --> 00:25:33.819]  Why don't they just put statins in the water or something?
[00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:36.520]  A lot of people have said that, and they are in the water, in fact.
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.422]  That would be a communist plot, just like fluoride.
[00:25:43.086 --> 00:25:44.007]  See how it's real funny?
[00:25:45.128 --> 00:25:48.111]  Let us now continue with your phone calls.
[00:25:49.052 --> 00:25:52.535]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Indiana.
[00:25:52.956 --> 00:25:54.037]  Jason, thank you for holding.
[00:25:55.918 --> 00:25:56.339]  Hey Alex.
[00:25:56.739 --> 00:25:58.101]  Hi.
[00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:01.484]  I think something is going to happen in the future.
[00:26:02.164 --> 00:26:05.708]  I don't know if this is happening in other states.
[00:26:07.082 --> 00:26:11.066]  The Governor of Indiana wants to privatize local government.
[00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:14.349]  But again, that isn't real local government.
[00:26:14.409 --> 00:26:17.231]  That's making your cities private corporations.
[00:26:18.152 --> 00:26:22.016]  The same thing that was done in Argentina and Brazil.
[00:26:22.376 --> 00:26:27.441]  When the bankers bankrupt you, they get the cities tricked into investing most their money into the
[00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:35.964]  Yeah, it's Colonel Shepard's report, and they want to do away with local governments and elected officials, and they want to appoint sheriffs and stuff.
[00:26:51.488 --> 00:26:58.234]  And like, small-town people are kind of all, you know, related and stuff, and they can kind of talk, you know, if something crazy's going on.
[00:26:58.274 --> 00:27:01.396]  Well, if they disappoint all these people, you know, they ain't gonna give a crap.
[00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:02.457]  Here's another example.
[00:27:02.978 --> 00:27:05.120]  Schwarzenegger and Bloomberg.
[00:27:06.798 --> 00:27:13.323]  Got the proposition passed in California to where the legislature doesn't choose the districts now.
[00:27:13.623 --> 00:27:20.249]  Now obviously there was corruption, gerrymandering, the way they drew the districts, but at least it was the people's representatives were doing it.
[00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:26.694]  Now, a board randomly selected by the governor
[00:27:28.883 --> 00:27:29.644]  Yeah, it's just...
[00:27:45.305 --> 00:27:59.850]  A lot of people, this real small town, and people's related, and if they knew something weird was going on, they'd probably try to help people out, but if, you know, they appoint all these people, heck, if you don't know who they're appointing, it'd probably be much easier for them to try to come to us.
[00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:08.853]  And how they do it is they say, let us take over your water district, let us take over your police department, let us take over the whole town, and we'll cut prices by twenty percent.
[00:28:08.913 --> 00:28:09.894]  What you don't read
[00:28:11.014 --> 00:28:17.760]  is that two to three to four years and they can quadruple prices tell the people to read the contract but
[00:28:19.013 --> 00:28:21.154]  It's the local city officials being paid off.
[00:28:21.214 --> 00:28:22.194]  They know it's a scam.
[00:28:22.474 --> 00:28:23.494]  They know what's going on.
[00:28:23.794 --> 00:28:25.255]  This is happening everywhere, sir.
[00:28:25.275 --> 00:28:30.896]  This is, again, just like they're stealing trillions a month out of the Treasury.
[00:28:31.657 --> 00:28:33.117]  In tax money, we've got to pay back.
[00:28:33.537 --> 00:28:35.098]  They're robbing everything.
[00:28:35.158 --> 00:28:36.118]  That's what this is about.
[00:28:36.498 --> 00:28:38.699]  Yeah, I figure it's happening in other states, too.
[00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:41.859]  I didn't know if it was... Specifically, though, this is something we should do an article about.
[00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:46.941]  I mean, the New York Times has done reports about it and said how wonderful it is, but we should do our own reports
[00:28:48.536 --> 00:28:51.206]  Or other radio hosts or other websites should do it.
[00:28:52.069 --> 00:28:53.735]  What specifically is happening in your town?
[00:28:54.528 --> 00:29:02.030]  I just know people that work in the courthouse and stuff and they're talking about how this is a bad thing.
[00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.930]  I think they should try to petition it, but they're probably not going to do no good.
[00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.831]  Well yeah, because they're trained to think we just have to let them do it.
[00:29:09.171 --> 00:29:09.551]  Stay there.
[00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:10.711]  I'm going to skip this segment.
[00:29:11.091 --> 00:29:17.713]  Skip this break behind the scenes for the Prison Planet dot TV viewers because I want to hear everything you know about this particular town you're in.
[00:29:18.573 --> 00:29:19.213]  And what's happening?
[00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:23.014]  I mean, I know what's going on, but it's good for the listeners to hear it brought home to them.
[00:29:23.314 --> 00:29:24.674]  Just, we've nothing we can do!
[00:29:24.974 --> 00:29:26.615]  This corporation's now the boss!
[00:29:27.015 --> 00:29:27.555]  Hello!
[00:29:28.035 --> 00:29:29.015]  Here's my farm!
[00:29:30.416 --> 00:29:35.337]  Okay, let me go back to... Let me go back to Jason.
[00:29:35.377 --> 00:29:36.517]  Where are you in Indiana?
[00:29:37.697 --> 00:29:40.518]  I'm in southern Indiana in Versailles.
[00:29:43.758 --> 00:29:44.659]  And tell us what's happening.
[00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:46.619]  I just know that...
[00:29:48.237 --> 00:30:16.683]  I got a friend that works in the courthouse and they're all talking, you know, they're all freaking out, kind of, because they heard about this Kernan Shepard's report and that they're going to try to, you know, in about a year or so, he got elected too, I voted against him because I heard about all this, but that they're going to try to, you know, privatize all the, you know, just privatize the local government and just bring in their own people and
[00:30:17.005 --> 00:30:18.346]  It'd probably be much easier for them.
[00:30:18.366 --> 00:30:20.587]  They haven't done it yet, but I think it's something.
[00:30:20.607 --> 00:30:32.315]  And again, you've got lots of boss hog, corrupt little towns, but then the people sometimes even get fooled and think, oh, we'll just hire a new company.
[00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:42.021]  But the reason the boss hog little towns do this is they get promised to, they're the ones that are going to get the jobs over it.
[00:30:43.407 --> 00:30:43.987]  You understand?
[00:30:44.427 --> 00:30:48.689]  So, whereas there was government before, they weren't allowed to openly steal.
[00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.910]  That's how this works.
[00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:58.693]  Most of these companies are German, Dutch, Japanese, Arab, you know, they're foreign, British, Israeli, but mainly European.
[00:30:58.733 --> 00:30:59.413]  You see that a lot.
[00:31:00.566 --> 00:31:00.966]  Yeah, I just
[00:31:30.867 --> 00:31:35.010]  I think he sold roads off and everything to foreigners and everything.
[00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.791]  It's sad.
[00:31:37.952 --> 00:31:47.079]  Again, if you study the Indiana, the New Jersey, the Texas cases, those companies don't even really pay for the road.
[00:31:47.699 --> 00:31:53.403]  They'll pay, say, in Texas, a billion bucks to get $400 billion in roads over 20 years.
[00:31:57.008 --> 00:31:57.970]  I mean, pull the numbers up.
[00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.372]  It's even worse than that.
[00:31:59.793 --> 00:32:01.195]  They are given everything.
[00:32:02.036 --> 00:32:08.847]  All they do is buy off the politicians, and then it's given to them, but then our cops will still
[00:32:10.143 --> 00:32:13.964]  Write tickets and feed on the public and we'll still pay tax money.
[00:32:14.325 --> 00:32:19.947]  And then in the Texas and Indiana deals, we even have to pay to upkeep the roads.
[00:32:20.387 --> 00:32:24.128]  See, we pay for everything, the private corporations get all the money.
[00:32:24.568 --> 00:32:25.929]  It's not privatization.
[00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:27.850]  It's mass stealing.
[00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:31.271]  Get ready!
[00:32:33.832 --> 00:32:34.812]  I appreciate your call.
[00:32:35.432 --> 00:32:37.693]  Oh yeah, they are taking everything.
[00:32:37.853 --> 00:32:39.134]  There's not much left right now.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.680]  But the public will find out.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.121]  Here we go.
[00:32:46.442 --> 00:32:53.064]  For those that don't know how government works, a lot of people think it's cute and funny to kill Iraqis.
[00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:56.986]  They think it's cute and funny to engage in all this tyranny.
[00:32:58.366 --> 00:32:59.967]  They think they're part of the establishment.
[00:33:00.007 --> 00:33:01.327]  They think they're part of the system.
[00:33:01.807 --> 00:33:06.249]  They think that they get power through George Bush or through Barack H. Obama.
[00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:09.170]  They think they're part of the system.
[00:33:10.376 --> 00:33:13.818]  And they have no idea that ruthless, cunning people are in control.
[00:33:14.219 --> 00:33:18.622]  I mean, over 3 million Iraqis are dead in the 18 years of occupation.
[00:33:19.562 --> 00:33:26.747]  Iraq's been bombed and occupied and under siege and under embargo and under blockade for 18 years.
[00:33:29.409 --> 00:33:29.809]  18 years!
[00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:39.276]  Now, just since the liberation, around a million and a half are dead, according to Lancet and all the other big medical journals that have independently gone over there and done those reports.
[00:33:41.394 --> 00:33:42.676]  Over a million and a half.
[00:33:42.696 --> 00:33:44.558]  A million and a half killed before that.
[00:33:46.281 --> 00:33:47.802]  Iraq was 25 million people.
[00:33:47.863 --> 00:33:48.644]  It's 20 million now.
[00:33:48.684 --> 00:33:49.745]  You're going, well, wait a minute.
[00:33:50.386 --> 00:33:51.587]  You said 3 million are dead.
[00:33:51.627 --> 00:33:52.609]  That would be 22 million.
[00:33:52.649 --> 00:33:53.390]  No.
[00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:55.593]  2 million others are refugees and have left.
[00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:58.013]  Thank God they got out with their lives.
[00:33:58.513 --> 00:34:08.735]  And you sit there and go, haha, because I see the YouTube comments when they're shooting kids, or blowing cars off the roads, and you see the troops with their handles, you can go to their own websites, their own YouTube pages.
[00:34:08.755 --> 00:34:10.936]  Because I'll click, I'll go, is that really a troop?
[00:34:11.736 --> 00:34:14.356]  And I'll click it and I'll be on his site with his own videos.
[00:34:14.896 --> 00:34:20.897]  And they'll be like, hell yeah, you gotta kill these scum and show them who's boss, these sand n-words.
[00:34:22.078 --> 00:34:24.558]  You know, you gotta... You haven't seen this stuff, Paul?
[00:34:25.933 --> 00:34:29.734]  You haven't seen the videos of the G.I.s laughing and just machine gunning whole families?
[00:34:31.575 --> 00:34:33.096]  You haven't seen the video of the contractors?
[00:34:34.236 --> 00:34:39.378]  Just sitting off the highway shooting up family cars while people stumble out dead, falling out dead?
[00:34:40.459 --> 00:34:41.559]  Have you seen them kill the puppy?
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.120]  Have you seen them shoot dogs?
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.441]  Have you seen them hand grenade sheep and families?
[00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:48.602]  Have you seen them beat little kids up?
[00:34:49.758 --> 00:34:50.959]  The blood's pouring out their heads.
[00:34:50.979 --> 00:34:57.202]  Have you seen them run over family cars for fun and make fun of the family while they cry with their car smashed by Abrams?
[00:35:00.003 --> 00:35:01.164]  I can show it all to you right now.
[00:35:02.765 --> 00:35:06.447]  The point here is that that was all condoned and sanctioned.
[00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:17.473]  In fact, the Pentagon has had to admit now that they gave them manuals telling the troops how to have drop guns.
[00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.032]  That when you grease a whole family, you just drop a drop gun.
[00:35:23.852 --> 00:35:31.516]  Now, do you think the New World Order cares about you any more than they care about those Iraqis?
[00:35:33.897 --> 00:35:35.598]  I happen to know the New World Order's mentality.
[00:35:35.638 --> 00:35:36.159]  I've studied them.
[00:35:36.439 --> 00:35:40.221]  They actually respect those ancient cultures, and they respect those people.
[00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:41.101]  That's why they're killing them.
[00:35:42.122 --> 00:35:42.962]  They want them out of the way.
[00:35:43.002 --> 00:35:43.743]  They want them under control.
[00:35:44.023 --> 00:35:45.403]  They respected the Serbs.
[00:35:45.444 --> 00:35:46.324]  That's why they took them down.
[00:35:46.664 --> 00:35:47.885]  They do not respect you.
[00:35:49.093 --> 00:35:54.016]  They think, but see, you don't get a glorious death being machine gunned, where you can tell it's a crime.
[00:35:54.297 --> 00:36:01.141]  You get injected with mercury, you get fed fluoride, you get sprayed, you get to die, and take your kid and bury him in the ground.
[00:36:02.242 --> 00:36:04.924]  With all the onset of, you know, juvenile cancer.
[00:36:05.945 --> 00:36:18.113]  Used to be incredibly rare, you know, just 50 years ago they'd take all the medical students in and show them a kid who had cancer, you know, at the Harvard Medical Wing, and they thought it was like a one-armed, one-horned, one-eyed, flying purple people eater.
[00:36:19.801 --> 00:36:21.764]  Now it's like just everywhere.
[00:36:22.344 --> 00:36:23.846]  Mass death, mass carnage.
[00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:25.408]  Go look at the numbers for yourself.
[00:36:25.428 --> 00:36:26.830]  See, you're getting it too.
[00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.572]  The same lovin'.
[00:36:30.654 --> 00:36:32.196]  So go ahead and roll your eyes and laugh.
[00:36:32.236 --> 00:36:33.278]  Everything I'm telling you is true.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.245]  The only reason I'm alive is because they don't want to make me a martyr and draw attention to me.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.142]  And because there's a lot of people in government who are good.
[00:36:44.442 --> 00:36:45.982]  You're like, well wait a minute, I thought the government's evil.
[00:36:46.323 --> 00:36:50.465]  At the top, the directives, the system is pure evil.
[00:36:51.085 --> 00:36:58.069]  But it's compartmentalized and they brainwash those beneath them and only give them pieces of the puzzle and convince them they're doing it for good.
[00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:07.974]  So if you think you're going to go kill Serbs and Iraqis and Afghans and that that's not going to come back on you,
[00:37:09.386 --> 00:37:12.367]  And you can dehumanize them and you won't be dehumanized.
[00:37:12.387 --> 00:37:13.668]  You've got another thing coming.
[00:37:14.928 --> 00:37:15.748]  Alright, I've got to hurry here.
[00:37:15.768 --> 00:37:16.969]  I've got a lot of calls I want to get to.
[00:37:17.689 --> 00:37:19.390]  Real fast, Chris in Canada, go ahead.
[00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.951]  Hello?
[00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:23.771]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:24.051 --> 00:37:26.092]  Yeah, I'd like to say thanks for all the enlightenment.
[00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:29.514]  You know, it's just amazing the way this world is.
[00:37:29.574 --> 00:37:38.317]  I've known something's been up for years, but to actually start connecting dots, the last six months have been quite huge for my wife and I.
[00:37:39.962 --> 00:38:00.559]  Revelations and stuff and the way the media is and everything everything you're saying is bang on the money one great event that happened up here in Canada where where I Live that really opened our eyes was I'm the trucker and I'm up on top of the Panacea summit and I noticed these airplanes laying down chemtrails I just recently started learning about chemtrails.
[00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:08.406]  This is in September here this year and this is 4,000 feet above sea level above the mountains between
[00:38:09.315 --> 00:38:20.959]  Valleys where cities are by the time these clouds get over above the Okanogan Valley where we live they look like high cirrus clouds and These particular two or three days.
[00:38:20.999 --> 00:38:35.104]  They were laying them down heavy heavy heavy heavy and within a couple of days in the valley you could barely see across the lake and Just atrocious and the news is saying it's smoke from the forest fires in Oregon.
[00:38:36.285 --> 00:38:37.405]  I Can't smell any smoke
[00:38:38.613 --> 00:38:43.337]  All my friends and relatives, they go, I saw smoke a little bit the other day.
[00:38:43.397 --> 00:38:55.348]  Well I'll tell you what's incredible is that we've written articles where thousands of universities and government websites admit there is a huge global program
[00:38:56.618 --> 00:38:56.718]  Yes.
[00:39:16.337 --> 00:39:23.039]  And said, yes, we are spraying you with barium and aluminum salts, which are deadly, folks.
[00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:23.459]  Again.
[00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:23.519]  Oh.
[00:39:24.319 --> 00:39:30.361]  And, and, and, and, and, I mean, again, until 96, a trail would go over and it would disappear in a few seconds or a minute.
[00:39:31.062 --> 00:39:37.063]  And you still see those trails right next to other jets laying down plumes that start falling towards you.
[00:39:37.123 --> 00:39:40.144]  And there's no doubt they're spraying the living daylights out of us.
[00:39:40.664 --> 00:39:41.285]  I'm a pilot.
[00:39:41.525 --> 00:39:42.385]  I know about airplanes.
[00:39:42.465 --> 00:39:43.045]  I know what it takes.
[00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:43.885]  I know altitudes.
[00:39:43.965 --> 00:39:45.466]  I know the vector airways up here.
[00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:53.034]  And I'm a little embarrassed I hadn't noticed it earlier to the extent that it is, but it's been particularly heavy this year.
[00:39:53.334 --> 00:39:56.335]  So I went on to the website for the Oregon Forest Service.
[00:39:57.255 --> 00:40:00.936]  And at that time, September 19th, was the day that I checked this out.
[00:40:01.077 --> 00:40:02.257]  It was posted that day.
[00:40:02.677 --> 00:40:05.378]  There was roughly 10 fires burning in the state.
[00:40:06.399 --> 00:40:08.379]  The largest one, I believe, was 75 acres.
[00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:09.780]  But it leaves hectares.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.741]  I know, I have friends that have fought fires.
[00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:13.961]  100 plus thousand hectares.
[00:40:13.981 --> 00:40:14.662]  It's over 200,000 acres.
[00:40:16.232 --> 00:40:17.093]  It doesn't create that much.
[00:40:17.133 --> 00:40:19.455]  Well, the point is, they admit.
[00:40:20.536 --> 00:40:23.498]  They admit that they're doing all of this to us.
[00:40:23.858 --> 00:40:25.340]  They now admit it.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.562]  Even when they admit they're getting rid of posse comitatus.
[00:40:29.063 --> 00:40:31.024]  Even when they admit they're building FEMA camps.
[00:40:31.144 --> 00:40:35.328]  Even when they admit the private banks are setting up world government, which they run.
[00:40:36.769 --> 00:40:39.391]  The general public still can't believe it.
[00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:40.992]  This is just at the sheet.
[00:40:41.052 --> 00:40:42.253]  We are up here in Canada.
[00:40:42.314 --> 00:40:44.455]  It is just absolutely amazing what's happening right now.
[00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:45.236]  Me being a trucker.
[00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:50.285]  Okay, I go over to Alberta, and all of a sudden I start hearing on, you know, the VHF radio.
[00:40:50.305 --> 00:40:52.006]  I said, what do you mean I can't get fuel in Red Deer?
[00:40:52.366 --> 00:41:01.351]  They're like, well, Chevron and Petro's completely out, Red Deer North, and they're rationing 400 litres per truck at the UFA card locks.
[00:41:01.911 --> 00:41:03.612]  I was in Calgary, so I was able to get fuel.
[00:41:04.453 --> 00:41:08.775]  So for six weeks, all the truckers in BC are like, man, grab your fuel now before you head out there.
[00:41:10.116 --> 00:41:10.896]  And things like that.
[00:41:11.417 --> 00:41:13.478]  And I'm sure you've heard about the gas line bombings.
[00:41:14.634 --> 00:41:16.136]  Oh yeah, all those bombings up there.
[00:41:16.376 --> 00:41:20.100]  My buddies in Alberta in the oil sector aren't hearing much about this.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.662]  They're claiming the natives are doing it.
[00:41:21.982 --> 00:41:25.686]  And us guys over here aren't hearing much about the fuel shortages in Alberta.
[00:41:25.706 --> 00:41:28.429]  You've got to almost be inside the local media groups.
[00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:29.270]  It doesn't get further.
[00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:34.756]  Even if you listen to CBC Radio to your local radio, a lot of the stuff is there locally, but nowhere else.
[00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:41.371]  Well, real terrorism you never hear about.
[00:41:41.391 --> 00:41:46.354]  I mean, if a real native group goes and starts blowing the pipeline up every week, that shows action.
[00:41:46.394 --> 00:41:49.036]  That shows something that could really shut the New World Order down.
[00:41:49.076 --> 00:41:49.796]  I'm not saying it's good.
[00:41:49.816 --> 00:41:52.518]  The point is, real terrorism is ignored.
[00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:55.160]  Whenever they hype something, you know it's staged.
[00:41:57.221 --> 00:41:58.282]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:41:59.403 --> 00:42:03.345]  I want to finish up with the calls, but I want to play this YouTube clip that's also up on
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.904]  Also up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, America being dumbed down.
[00:42:10.944 --> 00:42:12.205]  Let's go ahead and punch this up for me.
[00:42:12.825 --> 00:42:25.113]  And for PrisonPlanet.tv members that can watch this right here, I want to go ahead and play this clip for everybody because it's a good compilation.
[00:42:25.794 --> 00:42:31.037]  It's a good compilation, so I'm going to play this and we're going to come back and take a few final calls if we have time.
[00:42:33.379 --> 00:42:39.003]  We're developing a society because of all of these different toxins known to affect brain function.
[00:42:39.684 --> 00:42:46.609]  We're seeing a society that not only has a lot more people of lower IQ, but a lot fewer people of higher IQ.
[00:42:46.749 --> 00:42:51.073]  In other words, a dumbing down, a chemical dumbing down of society.
[00:42:51.413 --> 00:42:53.274]  So everyone's sort of mediocre.
[00:42:54.135 --> 00:42:56.697]  That leaves them dependent on government.
[00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:58.710]  Because they can't excel.
[00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:08.535]  We have these people with lower IQ who are totally dependent, and we have this mass of people who are going to believe anything they're told because they can't really think clearly.
[00:43:10.196 --> 00:43:16.579]  And very few people of very high IQ who have good cognitive function who can figure this all out.
[00:43:17.759 --> 00:43:18.620]  And that's what they want.
[00:43:20.413 --> 00:43:31.238]  So, you know, you can kind of piece it together as to why they are so insistent in spending so many hundreds of millions of dollars of propaganda money to dumb down society.
[00:43:36.314 --> 00:43:40.195]  This is a, I think that this bomber isn't Al-Qaeda, isn't anything like that.
[00:43:40.536 --> 00:43:47.098]  It's more, he's more like, it's a man, he's more like those 9-11 was an inside job kind of guys.
[00:43:47.398 --> 00:43:54.881]  They protesting in a violent way, but in a violent way almost like the eco-terrorists, but they don't intend to inflict casualties.
[00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:55.961]  But they do it in the middle of the night.
[00:43:55.981 --> 00:43:56.641]  In the middle of the night.
[00:43:56.661 --> 00:43:57.602]  He's making a political point.
[00:43:57.622 --> 00:44:00.763]  They could have killed people with it had it been in the day, but they choose to do it at 3am.
[00:44:01.603 --> 00:44:03.664]  The cops have to go over there, and we just talked to the commissioner.
[00:44:03.684 --> 00:44:06.264]  He used to go over and said, does that camera store have a security camera?
[00:44:06.524 --> 00:44:07.384]  Hey, can we see that?
[00:44:07.604 --> 00:44:10.585]  There's no master grid of all the cameras!
[00:44:10.645 --> 00:44:15.566]  A lot of politicians, and I know you talk about that issue all the time, I think people should be careful what they wish for on China.
[00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:22.388]  You know, if China were to revalue its currency, or if China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them, or food that isn't poisonous,
[00:44:22.988 --> 00:44:28.115]  Their costs of production are going to go up, and that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up, too.
[00:44:28.215 --> 00:44:30.738]  So, I would say China is our greatest friend right now.
[00:44:30.758 --> 00:44:39.870]  They're keeping prices low... Mercury-containing vaccines may help, not harm kids, according to two new studies in the Journal of Pediatrics in an African-American... No, no, no, no.
[00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:40.031]  Shut up.
[00:44:43.374 --> 00:44:46.977]  Why did you have to tell him you were an atheist if you didn't have any trouble reading the oath?
[00:44:47.197 --> 00:44:48.117]  Why didn't you just shut up?
[00:44:48.238 --> 00:44:53.161]  What Jimmy Carter should do is privately give Mr. Bush's opinion and shut up publicly.
[00:44:53.562 --> 00:44:54.663]  That would be best for the country.
[00:44:54.723 --> 00:45:01.008]  And it is our duty as loyal Americans to shut up once the fighting begins, once the war against Saddam begins.
[00:45:01.028 --> 00:45:06.072]  We expect every American to support our military and if they can't do that, to shut up.
[00:45:06.092 --> 00:45:07.012]  Can I just ask a question?
[00:45:07.413 --> 00:45:07.613]  Sure.
[00:45:07.833 --> 00:45:09.454]  What is Fox News?
[00:45:09.534 --> 00:45:12.155]  It's just a parade of propaganda, isn't it?
[00:45:12.475 --> 00:45:14.556]  It's just a festival of ignorance.
[00:45:15.156 --> 00:45:16.957]  Why, a million people are dead in Iraq.
[00:45:17.217 --> 00:45:18.518]  Come on, this is ridiculous.
[00:45:18.558 --> 00:45:19.358]  What's the point of this?
[00:45:20.339 --> 00:45:21.159]  This is insane.
[00:45:21.219 --> 00:45:22.880]  I love Fox News.
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.860]  Go outside.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.461]  Go hug your children.
[00:45:25.481 --> 00:45:26.321]  Love your family.
[00:45:26.462 --> 00:45:27.982]  All the news you can on Fox News.
[00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:42.031]  At the start you were listening to a medical doctor.
[00:45:42.731 --> 00:45:43.451]  Get him to fluoride.
[00:45:44.912 --> 00:45:45.412]  Aspartame.
[00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:48.534]  This is on mercury.
[00:45:49.595 --> 00:45:50.335]  Get them when they're young.
[00:45:56.974 --> 00:46:04.120]  Many infectious diseases can be brought completely under control when vaccination against them is practiced universally.
[00:46:04.541 --> 00:46:17.212]  We want people to be more educated because we don't feel like the truth is being told about thimerosal and about vaccines and about what the harm that it's doing to our children.
[00:46:17.492 --> 00:46:21.255]  People have to realize that these flu vaccines contain thimerosal.
[00:46:21.275 --> 00:46:30.841]  Thimerosal is a mercury preservative which has been directly linked to the autism epidemic that we have seen burst onto the scene over the past 10-15 years.
[00:46:31.361 --> 00:46:36.525]  Dr. Kurt Wuller believes the preservative is fueling a sharp rise in autism.
[00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:42.431]  One in 5,000 children had the developmental disorder in the late 1980s.
[00:46:43.012 --> 00:46:47.274]  Now one in 166 kids lives with autism.
[00:46:47.334 --> 00:46:51.115]  An increase in the amount of thimerosal injected into their bodies.
[00:46:51.716 --> 00:46:56.438]  Dr. Boyd Haley is a mercury poisoning expert at the University of Kentucky.
[00:46:57.078 --> 00:47:07.544]  He believes it is possible thimerosal could be responsible for neurological brain damage, especially for children who don't naturally get mercury out of their system.
[00:47:07.804 --> 00:47:09.525]  It's one of the most toxic compounds I know of.
[00:47:10.565 --> 00:47:13.167]  I mean, I can't think of anything that's absolutely more lethal.
[00:47:13.527 --> 00:47:16.908]  You can see that in this University of Calgary experiment.
[00:47:17.409 --> 00:47:20.070]  Mercury quickly destroys this neuron.
[00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.850]  It's really medical insanity.
[00:47:22.611 --> 00:47:27.933]  Just still allowing this neurotoxin that has damaged thousands and thousands of kids.
[00:47:28.353 --> 00:47:30.694]  I can't tell you, I'm really sick and tired.
[00:47:31.494 --> 00:47:38.796]  of seeing one kid after the next come through my office who I know clear-cut has been damaged by thimerosal in their vaccines.
[00:47:39.036 --> 00:47:46.817]  Thimerosal as a preservative has been in vaccines for decades so literally hundreds of millions of people have received thimerosal.
[00:47:47.177 --> 00:47:54.679]  As it turns out we are injecting our children with 400 times the amount of mercury that FDA or EPA considers safe.
[00:47:55.039 --> 00:47:59.860]  A child on his first day that he's born is injected with a hepatitis B shot
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:06.964]  Under EPA guidelines, he would have to be 275 pounds to safely absorb that shot.
[00:48:07.104 --> 00:48:11.366]  For years, science didn't support suspicions about the preservative.
[00:48:11.826 --> 00:48:24.774]  But recently, the National Autism Association used CDC's own data to conclude children are 27 times more likely to develop autism with exposure to mercury-containing vaccines.
[00:48:25.494 --> 00:48:32.938]  99% of the public really doesn't even realize that mercury is being used as a preservative in the vaccinations that they're taking themselves and giving their children.
[00:48:33.519 --> 00:48:38.061]  So, in essence, they're just blindly lining up to get flu shots.
[00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:48.347]  Okay, I'm going to come back in the final segment and finish the last few minutes.
[00:48:48.367 --> 00:48:50.148]  I don't know if I'll have time to get to the other callers.
[00:48:50.668 --> 00:48:52.189]  Who knows, I could go into overdrive today.
[00:48:53.663 --> 00:48:55.525]  You know, we could do more than four hours.
[00:48:56.767 --> 00:49:10.843]  We could always do that, but I did want to tell you about a couple sponsors before we... I'm actually going to take calls just for the InfoWars audience during the break that's coming up, because I don't want these people to sit on hold.
[00:49:11.323 --> 00:49:14.467]  But before we do that, I do want the listeners to check out
[00:49:15.822 --> 00:49:21.546]  The folks at New Vitality, newvitality.com, they don't make any magical claims.
[00:49:21.626 --> 00:49:34.175]  It's just a high-quality, well-established, great value, vitamin-mineral supplement company that sells a lot of different combinations of vitamins, minerals, and herbs that are known to have nutritive and health effects.
[00:49:34.775 --> 00:49:43.118]  Things like aloe vera with 29 other herbs in a combination in a pill form that is known to detoxify and flush out your guts.
[00:49:43.699 --> 00:49:45.339]  Aloe, Ease, Colon, and Body Cleanse.
[00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:45.419]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:49:45.439 --> 00:49:45.519]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:49:45.539 --> 00:49:47.440]  Or you can simply go to their website www.NewVitality.com.
[00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:48.761]  There's a big banner.
[00:49:57.024 --> 00:49:59.525]  On Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:59.545 --> 00:50:00.606]  They have hundreds of products.
[00:50:00.986 --> 00:50:07.909]  Check out NewVitality.com or give them a call for Super Beta Prostate, Aloe Ease, so many other great products.
[00:50:07.949 --> 00:50:10.511]  Call and get a free brochure or a catalog 1-800-569-4056.
[00:50:10.531 --> 00:50:10.591]  1-800-569-4056.
[00:50:10.611 --> 00:50:11.351]  Call and get the free catalog 1-800-569-4056.
[00:50:23.274 --> 00:50:30.777]  I'm going to come back and finish up with this video, America being dumbed down low and no IQ.
[00:50:31.777 --> 00:50:35.978]  But we're going to go ahead and skip this break for the InfoWars listeners.
[00:50:36.018 --> 00:50:36.499]  Stay with us.
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.461]  Man, I'm going to be ready to get out of here when the show's over with this cold.
[00:50:43.681 --> 00:50:45.922]  I'm not trying to whine, it's just that I seem kind of like I'm out of it.
[00:50:46.322 --> 00:50:47.082]  That's why, listeners.
[00:50:48.563 --> 00:50:49.903]  But people seem to like the show today.
[00:50:49.963 --> 00:50:51.123]  Do what?
[00:50:55.319 --> 00:50:55.939]  I can't hear you.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:58.380]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[00:50:59.381 --> 00:51:00.361]  Who's up next here?
[00:51:00.521 --> 00:51:02.142]  I guess Michelle in Chicago.
[00:51:02.422 --> 00:51:03.122]  Oh, she dropped out.
[00:51:03.222 --> 00:51:04.123]  Next up is Andrew.
[00:51:04.303 --> 00:51:05.383]  Andrew in Wisconsin.
[00:51:05.403 --> 00:51:05.943]  You're on the air.
[00:51:05.963 --> 00:51:06.324]  Go ahead.
[00:51:06.344 --> 00:51:10.765]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[00:51:11.606 --> 00:51:11.826]  All right.
[00:51:12.046 --> 00:51:12.906]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:51:13.026 --> 00:51:13.547]  Good, man.
[00:51:13.587 --> 00:51:13.967]  Go ahead.
[00:51:14.887 --> 00:51:16.468]  Hey, I wanted to encourage you.
[00:51:17.168 --> 00:51:22.330]  I've been in ministry for around 20 years, and it's very discouraging.
[00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:24.411]  I hear you talk about many of the
[00:51:24.847 --> 00:51:31.973]  Ministries and congregations, they don't have a clue what's going on, but one thing I want to encourage you, are you familiar with God TV?
[00:51:35.215 --> 00:51:35.936]  It rings a bell.
[00:51:35.996 --> 00:51:36.537]  Tell me about it.
[00:51:36.957 --> 00:51:41.481]  Well, God TV is a booming network around the world.
[00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:47.045]  It started in the UK, and it's becoming very, very popular around the world.
[00:51:47.105 --> 00:51:54.371]  In America, it came here a couple years ago, and they are actually now starting to expose the New World Order, so it's really exciting stuff.
[00:51:54.602 --> 00:51:55.563]  What's the name of the channel?
[00:51:56.484 --> 00:52:02.011]  Yeah, if you go to god.tv, that's their website.
[00:52:04.034 --> 00:52:11.143]  I haven't been able to watch it myself too much, but a friend of mine said that they're very much exposing everything right now.
[00:52:12.452 --> 00:52:13.652]  Well, I'll have to check it out.
[00:52:13.672 --> 00:52:20.514]  I know on Dish Network and some other channels, there are some Christian channels that have like David J. Smith on and stuff about the New World Order.
[00:52:21.694 --> 00:52:28.076]  We're not really a religious show, so I don't know if I'll be on those, but I am looking at some Dish Network and others to do my once a week TV show.
[00:52:28.616 --> 00:52:30.796]  We're working on that right now to get that all finished up.
[00:52:31.436 --> 00:52:35.777]  But we've got all our other duties we've got to continue while we're doing that, but we're going to do it.
[00:52:36.497 --> 00:52:38.358]  So that is all being developed right now.
[00:52:38.418 --> 00:52:38.878]  Anything else?
[00:52:39.861 --> 00:52:46.884]  Well, a friend of mine, after his election the other day, I've been knowing him for around 20 years, he called me up and he said, I can't take it anymore.
[00:52:47.544 --> 00:52:49.585]  I need, uh, I need some answers.
[00:52:49.685 --> 00:52:50.666]  I need to know where to go.
[00:52:50.706 --> 00:52:52.727]  No more Rush and no more Sean Hennedy.
[00:52:53.747 --> 00:52:58.609]  And, um, so I told him about GCN and now he's addicted to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:52:58.669 --> 00:53:09.314]  So, so as long as he doesn't put you on a pedestal, as long as he keeps his priorities in the right perspective, but I know that he'll do that, but I'm really glad to know that more and more people are waking up.
[00:53:09.758 --> 00:53:10.822]  Well, that's how it works.
[00:53:12.219 --> 00:53:15.120]  By you putting the word out about this show is how we reach more people.
[00:53:15.821 --> 00:53:26.585]  And, yeah, with Rush and Hannity, I mean, Rush is still saying there's no world government and no new world order when every world leader is calling for it and saying the banks are going to run everything.
[00:53:26.605 --> 00:53:28.746]  I mean, everything we said is happening.
[00:53:29.066 --> 00:53:30.707]  Everything we talked about is coming true.
[00:53:31.227 --> 00:53:34.188]  And all they can do is point at kooks in the alternative movement.
[00:53:34.208 --> 00:53:39.190]  There are plenty of those who talk about ridiculous stuff and try to get us through straw men.
[00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:40.191]  I appreciate you calling.
[00:53:40.211 --> 00:53:40.551]  Take care.
[00:53:45.333 --> 00:53:54.221]  Alright, real fast, let's go to Jennifer in Delaware, then I'm going to have to cut it off there with Carl and Canada and others, because I want to finish up this audio and video clip.
[00:53:55.742 --> 00:53:57.224]  Go ahead, Jennifer, thanks for calling.
[00:53:58.425 --> 00:54:01.727]  Yes, I actually had a question on this year's election.
[00:54:01.948 --> 00:54:10.875]  I have a friend who's incarcerated, and he told me that people came to them and told them that if they vote for Obama, they put $100 on their books.
[00:54:13.137 --> 00:54:17.054]  And I wanted to know if this was going on in any other states or if you heard anything about this.
[00:54:18.206 --> 00:54:25.249]  There has always been an old-fashioned Democratic Party machine buying votes, paying people to vote in dead people's names.
[00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.190]  You know, we always hear dead people voted.
[00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:31.632]  Yeah, living people go out with a list, and they go around posing as that person.
[00:54:32.192 --> 00:54:40.696]  And yes, the Democratic machine generally steals through voter fraud, and the Republicans are more masters at stealing at the top.
[00:54:41.056 --> 00:54:43.197]  That doesn't mean that both sides don't do both.
[00:54:44.357 --> 00:54:46.578]  But I didn't believe it when I heard it.
[00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:53.142]  Then I saw the video of the Black Panthers standing outside a polling place with a nightstick trying to intimidate whites.
[00:54:53.682 --> 00:54:57.764]  And yes, just because there's racist whites doesn't mean there's not racist blacks.
[00:54:58.985 --> 00:55:03.347]  Just so crazy that stuff went on like that.
[00:55:03.407 --> 00:55:05.028]  But people think they're going to be saved.
[00:55:05.329 --> 00:55:07.350]  They think all their problems are solved.
[00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:09.711]  We've got to do anything to get Obama elected.
[00:55:12.089 --> 00:55:16.633]  Also, do you know what these vaccines are supposed to be for, that are so mandatory?
[00:55:17.373 --> 00:55:18.654]  Well, none of them are mandatory.
[00:55:18.694 --> 00:55:24.118]  The whole issue is the government lies and says they are, but tell them to show you the law they can't.
[00:55:24.498 --> 00:55:25.339]  I appreciate your call.
[00:55:25.379 --> 00:55:25.999]  I'm out of time.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.061]  People can call me back tomorrow, of course.
[00:55:28.081 --> 00:55:29.942]  I'm going to play as much of this clip as I can.
[00:55:30.002 --> 00:55:32.784]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:55:33.465 --> 00:55:35.987]  This is fluoride.
[00:55:36.047 --> 00:55:37.768]  Get them for life.
[00:55:37.828 --> 00:55:39.009]  We've gotten to that part of the video.
[00:55:46.229 --> 00:55:50.981]  Edward L. Bernays is regarded by many as the father of public relations.
[00:55:51.402 --> 00:55:53.086]  He was born in Vienna, Austria.
[00:55:53.387 --> 00:55:55.312]  Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud.
[00:55:56.596 --> 00:56:03.382]  Bernays pioneered the use of psychology and other social sciences to design public persuasion campaigns.
[00:56:04.343 --> 00:56:09.588]  He published several scholarly works, still used in universities worldwide today.
[00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:18.136]  And he also spearheaded the national campaign to fluoridate the water supply of America through the Fluoridationist of the Public Health Service.
[00:56:25.006 --> 00:56:29.270]  This is one pollutant that we capture in the phosphate fertilizer industry.
[00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:35.435]  And having captured it, we can't dump it into the sea, but we put it into our own drinking water.
[00:56:36.275 --> 00:56:37.496]  It's extraordinary.
[00:56:37.516 --> 00:56:43.261]  Fluoride in our water supply is a very real and ever-present risk to our population at large.
[00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:44.802]  Dennis, let's make sure we're clear on this.
[00:56:44.882 --> 00:56:50.747]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste, but it's actually a poison, right?
[00:56:51.047 --> 00:56:53.269]  It sure is, and here's the quickest evidence.
[00:56:53.369 --> 00:57:02.777]  Go to your bathroom and pick up your toothpaste, and you'll see a warning that if a child swallows more than a pea-sized amount of toothpaste, call poison control.
[00:57:04.895 --> 00:57:12.237]  The protected pollutant status that fluoride enjoys within EPA and other federal establishments is remarkable as the charts over here show.
[00:57:13.226 --> 00:57:24.271]  Last November, concerns over excess fluoride prompted the American Dental Association to warn parents not to mix baby formula with tap water during an infant's first 12 months.
[00:57:24.831 --> 00:57:35.396]  Phyllis Mullenix found that fluoride in very modest doses produces effects in laboratory animals resembling attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.
[00:57:35.496 --> 00:57:37.837]  She says, do you have any idea what you're saying?
[00:57:38.637 --> 00:57:41.859]  And he says, you're telling us that we're reducing the IQ of children.
[00:57:43.445 --> 00:57:44.747]  And basically I said yes.
[00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:56.961]  Scientists like Nobel Prize winner Arvid Carlsson and a large group of EPA scientists have called for the banning of fluoride because we don't know how much we're ingesting, so we don't know if we're being poisoned.
[00:57:58.407 --> 00:58:00.209]  Alright folks, this is an important video.
[00:58:00.229 --> 00:58:04.052]  Nice little ten minute piece that somebody made on YouTube.
[00:58:04.813 --> 00:58:06.735]  Be sure and get it at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:06.755 --> 00:58:07.536]  Get it out to everybody.
[00:58:07.956 --> 00:58:08.737]  God bless you all.
[00:58:08.777 --> 00:58:13.541]  Rebroadcast on the internet starts now at InfoWars.com and JonesReport.com.
[00:58:13.962 --> 00:58:17.445]  And then I'll be back on the MNFMs all over the place as they rehearse.
[00:58:17.485 --> 00:58:19.026]  And back tomorrow live, 11 to 3.
[00:58:19.267 --> 00:58:19.867]  God bless you all.
[00:58:19.907 --> 00:58:20.568]  Thank you for tuning in.
