[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:05.275]  Welcome my friends, it is already the second day of April 2008 and we're coming in hot
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:37.184]  We have Jesse DeMind Ventura, of course, naval veteran, professional wrestling champion, Hollywood movie star, governor of Minnesota, television host, best-selling author, and he's with us for the full hour today.
[00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:46.966]  Jesse Ventura, new book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, and we're going to get into the CIA visiting his office the first day he showed up at the Capitol.
[00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:49.507]  We're going to get into his wife finding a bug at their home.
[00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:52.408]  We're going to talk about his views on the JFK assassination.
[00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:59.952]  We're going to talk about will he ever run for president, we'll talk about the Patriot Act, the war, and a lot more in the next 60 minutes.
[00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:02.433]  Jesse Ventura, it's an honor to have you on, Governor.
[00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:07.055]  Hi Alex, great to be here, and hi to everybody in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:12.198]  You know, I got down there when Kinky was running for Governor, and it's a beautiful part of Texas where you're at.
[00:01:12.578 --> 00:01:12.898]  Yes, sir.
[00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:18.443]  Well, we're on in Austin, Texas and San Diego and Kansas City, a lot of other places, and it's great to have you on with us.
[00:01:18.463 --> 00:01:23.588]  We hope you'll come back and visit Kinky and Willie and a lot of others in the near future, sir.
[00:01:24.128 --> 00:01:26.470]  There's a lot to talk about in this short segment we've got.
[00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.812]  What do you think is most important about this book?
[00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:30.974]  I don't just say this when I have guests on.
[00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:32.735]  I couldn't put this book down.
[00:01:32.795 --> 00:01:33.336]  It's amazing.
[00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:34.931]  Well, thank you.
[00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:36.552]  You know, I wrote the book.
[00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:44.336]  I now live in Mexico for half the year, and I got together with Dick Russell, a friend of mine down there who's a writer, and we put this book together.
[00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:51.799]  But I think the main thing that I want to stress and get across to people is that we do need a revolution in this country.
[00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:54.980]  And when I say revolution, that doesn't mean it has to be violence.
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.384]  You know, typically people think that, you know, like overthrowing the government of Cuba when Castro and Che Guevara did that with violence.
[00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:14.313]  We can have a revolution without violence, and it's high time for it, Alex, because, I mean, my God, the Democrats and Republicans, we are now $9 trillion in debt.
[00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:15.934]  That is the national debt.
[00:02:16.495 --> 00:02:24.120]  And if they behave that way in the private sector, they'd be jailed and put in prison, you know, like Enron and WorldCom.
[00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:31.506]  Our media and all our pundits put them up on pedestals, they call them honorable, and the whole thing.
[00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:36.050]  And our history books will say how great they are, and they're selling our country out from right under our feet.
[00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:39.533]  And that's why you say, don't start the revolution without me.
[00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:42.816]  And I agree, the most successful revolutions really aren't violent.
[00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:49.781]  Look at the Renaissance itself, it was a revolution of ideas, and the printing press, and free market.
[00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:59.558]  I see what we need to develop is something similar to the Renaissance, a rediscovery of liberty and freedom, and what Ron Paul has said, legalizing freedom.
[00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:00.859]  Exactly.
[00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:18.473]  You know, Ron Paul was a very interesting candidate in the presidential race, that the media really kind of pushed him off and didn't listen to what he had to say, and that's the sad part about it, because I found it very interesting when Bhutto was killed over in Pakistan,
[00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:31.190]  All of the candidates went on with this big litany of what the United States should be doing and this and that and whatever, and it got to Ron Paul and he said something to me that was the best answer.
[00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.813]  He simply said, isn't that Pakistan's business?
[00:03:36.087 --> 00:03:36.768]  Absolutely.
[00:03:37.308 --> 00:03:40.610]  Well, you know, Ron Paul is still out there on the campaign trail.
[00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.193]  I mean, he's admitting he's not going to win, but he's there to inject real issues into the debate.
[00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:47.634]  That's why I wish you'd run, Jesse Ventura.
[00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:50.997]  In fact, I wish you'd run right now so we could at least inject real issues.
[00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:53.858]  Well, you know, it was interesting.
[00:03:53.938 --> 00:04:00.583]  I did Larry King last night, and Larry started at the start of the show and asked a question.
[00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:04.105]  He said, how many people think Jesse Ventura should run for president?
[00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:07.523]  And I was astounded by the end of the show.
[00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:08.944]  It just floored me.
[00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:12.546]  I thought maybe if I got 50 or 60 percent, I'd be doing good.
[00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:15.167]  It was 85 percent, Alex.
[00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:17.209]  It was just mind-boggling.
[00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.132]  Well, there's incredible disenfranchisement with the major two parties, as you know.
[00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:27.535]  I mean, look at Congress with, depending on the poll, an 11 to 20 percent approval rating.
[00:04:27.575 --> 00:04:28.696]  Both parties are hated now.
[00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:30.497]  Well, and they should be.
[00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:35.901]  As I said, they've put us so far in debt, I can't even fathom what nine trillion dollars is.
[00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:36.582]  Can you?
[00:04:37.342 --> 00:04:38.003]  No, I can't.
[00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:47.130]  Jesse the Mind Ventura will be back in about two minutes on the other side of this quick break, right here on the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:04:54.536 --> 00:04:55.837]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:56.983 --> 00:04:58.043]  A New World Order.
[00:04:58.744 --> 00:05:03.465]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.645 --> 00:05:06.426]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:08.727]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:09.247 --> 00:05:11.687]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.448 --> 00:05:19.770]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:27.783]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:31.687]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:34.589]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.830]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.611]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:37.712]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.912 --> 00:05:38.613]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.893 --> 00:05:40.014]  That's what they're after.
[00:05:40.034 --> 00:05:44.518]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:44.778 --> 00:05:47.801]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:48.501]  Endgame.
[00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:51.424]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:52.745]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.445 --> 00:05:53.726]  Fact.
[00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:59.831]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:05:59.951 --> 00:06:04.215]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:11.801]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:12.622]  The solution.
[00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:16.805]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Qi Premier Energy Footspa.
[00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:26.011]  The Electro Qi Premier Energy Footspa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:34.136]  Detoxification works with the Electro Qi Premier Energy Footspa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:38.859]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.423]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[00:06:43.463 --> 00:06:46.005]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:12.445]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:16.786]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:20.648]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[00:07:20.828 --> 00:07:30.872]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[00:07:31.112 --> 00:07:36.116]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:38.938]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.
[00:07:39.078 --> 00:07:43.642]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flour.
[00:07:43.782 --> 00:07:47.905]  The Champion Juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[00:07:48.005 --> 00:07:50.487]  The world's finest juicer is Champion Juicer.
[00:07:50.687 --> 00:07:52.889]  Ask for it at your favorite health food store online today.
[00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:59.874]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:01.474 --> 00:08:08.456]  He's got so many titles that I don't know which one to call him by, but we'll just go with Governor Ventura.
[00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:11.296]  Jesse DeMine Ventura with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:08:12.917 --> 00:08:17.858]  This book is titled, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:19.058]  I think it's a wonderful title.
[00:08:19.078 --> 00:08:22.159]  And it's in stores everywhere today.
[00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:24.780]  He's just launching his tour yesterday.
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.100]  We're honored to have him.
[00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:36.903]  But you could also call it The Adventures of Jesse Ventura, because it is quite a page-turner, because you've had quite a full life.
[00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:42.209]  Why did you decide to write this particular style of book?
[00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.792]  Well, first of all, Alex, I want to explain.
[00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:53.539]  I had two New York Times bestsellers before this book, and of course, they gave me huge front money to write that book.
[00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:54.900]  It was interesting.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.541]  I'll give you a little inside info.
[00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:59.123]  This book, we wrote it down in Mexico.
[00:08:59.184 --> 00:09:09.432]  We brought the full transcript back, Dick Russell and I. We were turned down by 24 publishers, and I already had two New York Times bestsellers.
[00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:11.013]  I found that pretty interesting.
[00:09:12.637 --> 00:09:13.580]  Are you breaking that here?
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.828]  Because I did quite a bit of research for this interview and I hadn't seen that.
[00:09:18.297 --> 00:09:19.257]  Got my what out there?
[00:09:19.577 --> 00:09:21.378]  No, I mean, is this the first time you've told this story?
[00:09:21.778 --> 00:09:22.058]  Yeah.
[00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:23.158]  Wow.
[00:09:23.478 --> 00:09:24.358]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:31.580]  Well, I mean, we got turned down by 24 and finally Skyhorse, which is a small publishing company in New York, picked it up.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.081]  But the good thing is we're with Norton Distribution, which is a huge distributor.
[00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:40.462]  And that's the key, is once you get published, then you need to get it to a good distributor.
[00:09:40.482 --> 00:09:42.463]  And they're one of the biggest, so it'll be everywhere.
[00:09:43.463 --> 00:09:44.785]  You know, I wrote this book.
[00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:49.430]  I didn't take any big-front money because I truly wanted this book out there.
[00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.512]  I didn't care about the money on this book.
[00:09:51.572 --> 00:09:53.053]  I wanted to tell my story.
[00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:56.797]  I wanted to tell about the things that happened when I was in office.
[00:09:56.837 --> 00:10:01.843]  Because, Alex, I don't know if... Certainly, you read the book, so you know this.
[00:10:02.083 --> 00:10:04.826]  MSNBC, in essence, censored me.
[00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:09.868]  Because when I came out of office, I was the hottest commodity out there.
[00:10:09.908 --> 00:10:11.608]  I was the voice of the independent.
[00:10:11.808 --> 00:10:15.650]  CNN wanted me, MSNBC wanted me, Fox News wanted me.
[00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:21.313]  I signed with MSNBC and then essentially they wouldn't even put me on the air.
[00:10:21.793 --> 00:10:27.575]  And my contract stated that I couldn't do any news shows or I couldn't do any cable or satellite.
[00:10:28.016 --> 00:10:30.917]  And so I believe I was silenced on purpose.
[00:10:31.864 --> 00:10:33.465]  Let's stop right there, Governor Ventura.
[00:10:33.485 --> 00:10:36.988]  This is all amazing bombshells that you're dropping on us.
[00:10:37.088 --> 00:10:41.152]  First, you've had two super New York Times bestsellers.
[00:10:42.653 --> 00:10:47.417]  You've been the dark horse candidate of the people in Minnesota.
[00:10:47.777 --> 00:10:53.400]  You spurred Schwarzenegger to run and caused that whole phenomenon, and he's basically admitted it, seeing you have success.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.460]  He went for it.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:07.526]  You have this amazing history, Hollywood star, and you went to 20-plus publishers, and they said no, and you went to a new publisher that just fired up, what, in 2007, according to what I was reading on their site.
[00:11:08.226 --> 00:11:12.448]  I mean, that is a story of censorship alone and their fear of your message.
[00:11:12.508 --> 00:11:16.790]  But now we're learning, and yes, you do mention it in the book, and of course, I get into it,
[00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:27.278]  But there's so much in the book, I'd forgotten about that, that MSNBC literally muzzled you and used that contract to block you from going anywhere else.
[00:11:27.878 --> 00:11:28.519]  Exactly.
[00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:30.000]  They wouldn't put me on the internet.
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.044]  The reason for it was because I was opposed to the Iraq War before it started.
[00:11:35.764 --> 00:11:36.285]  It's suicide.
[00:11:53.183 --> 00:11:55.544]  Well, you don't do that, and yet they did it.
[00:11:55.564 --> 00:12:04.907]  You know, they pulled Phil, and then they wouldn't allow me on, and it was because Phil and I were both questioning the reasons why are we going into Iraq.
[00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:10.209]  If you believe 9-11 and what they told us, there wasn't one Iraqi even involved in it.
[00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:11.810]  Iraq did nothing to us.
[00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:13.806]  Well, that's right.
[00:12:13.846 --> 00:12:29.211]  There are still some neocon followers of what I call fake conservative news shows that still believe Saddam was the one behind the attack when Bush and Cheney admit he had nothing to do with it and actually fought against the Wahhabis based in Saudi Arabia known as Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:40.536]  Well, I don't know if you can ever get Dick Cheney to admit that and George Bush, but I know that they still like to refer back and try to tie the two together all the time somehow.
[00:12:40.736 --> 00:12:42.657]  There are a few clips where they've had to admit it.
[00:12:42.937 --> 00:12:44.978]  One time Cheney was on with Russert and had to admit it.
[00:12:45.438 --> 00:12:46.539]  Oh, okay.
[00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:49.680]  You probably watch more than I do because I'm living in Mexico now.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.481]  You know, that's another subject that's interesting, Alex.
[00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:56.043]  This whole situation with immigration.
[00:12:57.285 --> 00:13:06.831]  I mean, I live down with all these brown-skinned people down there, and I don't know about you and where you stand on it, but I don't believe the United States needs to be East Berlin.
[00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:16.775]  Okay, well we're going to play that coming up in a little while.
[00:13:17.216 --> 00:13:20.940]  But last night you said, hey Lou Dobbs, what are you so afraid of?
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.205]  I live down, you know, in the middle of nowhere in Mexico and these brown-skinned people are pretty nice.
[00:13:25.646 --> 00:13:27.127]  They're very nice, I'll tell you.
[00:13:27.227 --> 00:13:29.069]  I have the time of my life down there.
[00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:32.894]  And Alex, I live an hour from pavement and an hour from electricity.
[00:13:34.784 --> 00:13:35.745]  Tell us about where you live.
[00:13:46.517 --> 00:13:46.957]  In my mind.
[00:13:46.977 --> 00:13:47.578]  What's it look like?
[00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:48.378]  Where is it?
[00:13:48.438 --> 00:13:49.298]  It's beautiful.
[00:13:49.338 --> 00:13:51.859]  Well, I don't want to get you too close.
[00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:52.319]  Don't worry.
[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:53.420]  I'm not going to come down there.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.021]  I'm just saying I can picture you in this little jungle bungalow off the beach.
[00:13:57.582 --> 00:13:58.222]  Well, trust me.
[00:13:58.282 --> 00:14:00.003]  It's not quite a jungle bungalow.
[00:14:00.063 --> 00:14:07.946]  It's three bedrooms, three and a half baths with a casita in the back, a two and a half car garage, my own swimming pool, and 40 of my own palm trees.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.521]  Sounds awesome.
[00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:10.542]  It's great.
[00:14:11.242 --> 00:14:13.724]  So what, you just go out and scuba dive and surf all day?
[00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:15.806]  I scuba dive, I hang with the surfers.
[00:14:15.846 --> 00:14:28.938]  We've got a whole group of expatriates down there, surfers, who they work up in the United States for six months and they save their money and then they go down and live in the arroyos on little campsites and surf all the time and they're marvelous people.
[00:14:29.841 --> 00:14:30.221]  No, no.
[00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:38.385]  Believe me, every day I dream about moving off to some tropical paradise, so you certainly are living the life.
[00:14:38.685 --> 00:14:43.307]  So you're just coming back to the U.S., I guess, because you're so sick of seeing it turn into a police state?
[00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.048]  Well, I come back every year.
[00:14:46.068 --> 00:14:54.092]  I should make mention, I live there six months, and if you've ever been to Minnesota, I wouldn't wish a Minnesota winter on my worst enemy.
[00:14:55.091 --> 00:15:00.023]  Yeah, because they're brutal and after living there my whole life, so I really live as the leaves are.
[00:15:00.444 --> 00:15:02.670]  If the leaves are out, I'm in Minnesota.
[00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.675]  If the leaves are gone, I'm in Mexico.
[00:15:05.911 --> 00:15:10.793]  Well, this network, I'm based in Austin, but the network, Genesis Network, is based in Minneapolis, St.
[00:15:10.853 --> 00:15:13.293]  Paul, in a little area called Burnsville, I'm sure you know it.
[00:15:13.313 --> 00:15:13.453]  Sure.
[00:15:13.473 --> 00:15:15.594]  You know it well, South Minneapolis.
[00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:21.136]  And I've been up there, and let me tell you, for a Texas boy, I can't handle it when you breathe, and it feels like your teeth are going to fall out.
[00:15:21.596 --> 00:15:27.558]  Oh, it's, believe me, you don't even have to be a Texas boy, you're a Minnesota boy, and you get the same reaction.
[00:15:29.676 --> 00:15:32.498]  Let's go back to your first day as governor.
[00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:41.723]  You've just shocked the whole country, coming from nowhere in the polls to winning handily as the first major independent governor.
[00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:44.765]  I guess there's been one more before you in Minnesota history.
[00:15:46.126 --> 00:15:51.429]  You come into office and you tell the story of 20-plus CIA agents in your office.
[00:15:52.086 --> 00:15:56.887]  Well, actually, the accurate part of this is I was the second independent governor.
[00:15:56.927 --> 00:15:59.708]  Let's give credit to Governor Angus King of Maine.
[00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:04.650]  Angus served one term ahead of me and did two terms in Maine.
[00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.111]  He was on his second term when I was doing my first.
[00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:16.473]  He just didn't get all the publicity that I got, but Angus proved invaluable to me because he had been there four years already and done that.
[00:16:17.293 --> 00:16:19.794]  Whenever we'd go to the National Governor's Convention,
[00:16:20.494 --> 00:16:35.303]  On the second day out in Washington, all the Republican governors would meet in this building, all the Democratic governors would meet in this other building, and Angus and I would take a walk on Constitution Avenue and sit down on the park bench and have the independent governors meeting.
[00:16:36.764 --> 00:16:41.126]  But anyway, the CIA story did not happen on my first day.
[00:16:41.186 --> 00:16:48.471]  It was about three weeks into it, and I got this request, we'll call it with quotes around it, to the bowels of the Capitol.
[00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:53.053]  Basically, to be interrogated by 23 members of the CIA.
[00:16:53.534 --> 00:17:00.338]  Of which, you know, of course, they tried to say I was lying about it, but the CIA came out and admitted that it did happen.
[00:17:00.718 --> 00:17:06.161]  In fact, I have NPR'd an investigation of it in January of this year.
[00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:08.502]  CIA confirms Ventura meeting occurred.
[00:17:09.163 --> 00:17:12.625]  Also, the Minneapolis paper also confirmed it.
[00:17:12.685 --> 00:17:13.605]  And I have the quotes here.
[00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:18.028]  At first they said, I don't recall any indication that the governor had a meeting with CIA agents.
[00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:22.274]  And then they went on to say, you know, we don't meet with state officials.
[00:17:22.394 --> 00:17:25.095]  Then they added, now that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
[00:17:25.355 --> 00:17:28.356]  And then others implied you were lying, but then they had to admit it.
[00:17:28.676 --> 00:17:36.800]  And then it has the quotes by the CIA liaison officers saying, well, yes, we like to meet with state officials, but we don't like to talk about it.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:45.744]  Well, I felt it needed to be talked about because what happened in this meeting when I went down there, bear in mind now I'm the governor.
[00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:53.193]  And I was, they were very cordial, they were very formal, they treated me with great respect, let me say that.
[00:17:53.353 --> 00:17:54.114]  But they summoned you.
[00:17:54.864 --> 00:17:55.144]  Yes.
[00:17:55.785 --> 00:18:02.208]  And so, you know, being ex-military, you kind of figure when your country summons you, you better go down and talk to them.
[00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:05.690]  But, you know, I didn't realize fully yet the power that I had as governor.
[00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.971]  It was all very new to me.
[00:18:07.692 --> 00:18:13.535]  So I went down into the bowels of the Capitol, and there were like 23 of them in a big half-moon circle around me.
[00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:16.517]  And you know what the scary thing, Alex, about it was?
[00:18:17.177 --> 00:18:18.258]  They were your neighbors.
[00:18:19.853 --> 00:18:27.027]  And what I mean by that is, you saw an elderly woman that looked like the lady down the street that would sweep her walk off in the morning.
[00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:28.509]  You saw young people.
[00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:32.337]  They were every race, creed, color, age you could imagine.
[00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:43.528]  And so, you know, knowing me, I'm a bit arrogant, so I said to them, I said, look, I said, before I answer any of your questions, I said, I have a few questions of my own.
[00:18:43.608 --> 00:18:51.313]  And the first one I posed was, why are you here when your charter states you're not to be operational within the United States of America?
[00:18:51.353 --> 00:18:53.094]  And what did they say?
[00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.555]  They didn't really give me an answer.
[00:18:55.495 --> 00:19:02.501]  You know, they hemmed and hawed and talked around it, and then I said, now I want to go around the room and I want you to tell me your name and what you do.
[00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:04.282]  Well, I'm the governor.
[00:19:04.603 --> 00:19:06.424]  Half of them wouldn't tell me their names.
[00:19:06.444 --> 00:19:08.206]  Half of them wouldn't tell me what they did.
[00:19:08.226 --> 00:19:09.126]  That's incredible!
[00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:12.409]  They expect you to meet with them, but they won't even tell you their names.
[00:19:12.829 --> 00:19:14.150]  No.
[00:19:14.331 --> 00:19:22.157]  And so I looked at them and said, well, you know, being that you're not being very cooperative with me, I'm going to find it a bit difficult to be cooperative with you.
[00:19:23.798 --> 00:19:24.359]  Amazing.
[00:19:25.317 --> 00:19:26.679]  And then it turned out.
[00:19:26.719 --> 00:19:27.920]  Here's how the story went.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.401]  We'll stay there, Jesse Ventura.
[00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:30.142]  We gotta break.
[00:19:30.322 --> 00:19:33.885]  We'll be right back after this quick break with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:19:34.186 --> 00:19:35.247]  He's got a new book out.
[00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:36.728]  They're trying to censor it.
[00:19:36.768 --> 00:19:37.609]  You need to get it.
[00:19:38.069 --> 00:19:40.031]  Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell.
[00:19:40.311 --> 00:19:42.714]  Don't start the revolution without me.
[00:19:43.354 --> 00:19:45.276]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is so much in this book.
[00:19:45.296 --> 00:19:48.079]  We'll never have time to cover it in an hour, but we're gonna try.
[00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:49.160]  You gotta get the book.
[00:19:55.472 --> 00:19:57.514]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:07.086]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:07.627 --> 00:20:14.735]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:15.436 --> 00:20:20.920]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:32.210]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.390]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.131]  A new world order.
[00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:35.711]  In the near future.
[00:21:00.711 --> 00:21:03.494]  The Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:03.874 --> 00:21:05.996]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:06.696 --> 00:21:08.938]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:11.921]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:12.662 --> 00:21:19.988]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:27.964]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:28.445 --> 00:21:31.907]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:32.327 --> 00:21:34.809]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:36.050]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.810]  They're not after money.
[00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.911]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:38.832]  They're after power.
[00:21:39.112 --> 00:21:40.233]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:24:15.406 --> 00:24:17.068]  Quick segment, long segment coming up.
[00:24:17.108 --> 00:24:18.729]  Plenty of time to talk to the governor.
[00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:20.411]  He's been gracious enough to give us a full hour today.
[00:24:21.011 --> 00:24:23.513]  Continuing with your CIA story, this is amazing.
[00:24:24.294 --> 00:24:26.836]  So you say to them, I want to know what your name is.
[00:24:27.657 --> 00:24:28.237]  How did it end?
[00:24:28.277 --> 00:24:29.999]  Did you ever even find out why they were there?
[00:24:31.072 --> 00:24:31.793]  Not really.
[00:24:31.813 --> 00:24:40.318]  I think it was kind of like an interrogation for their students or whatever, or for their agents or whatever.
[00:24:40.378 --> 00:24:41.499]  I'm not really sure.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.402]  But when I did go home that day, it troubled me a great deal.
[00:24:46.162 --> 00:24:50.887]  And so I called a friend of mine, I don't know if you've heard of Richard Marcinko?
[00:24:51.247 --> 00:24:51.687]  Oh yes!
[00:24:52.068 --> 00:25:01.296]  The rogue warrior, he's 32 years as a Navy SEAL, he created the controversial SEAL Team 6, the anti-terrorist unit, Red Cell and all that.
[00:25:02.057 --> 00:25:04.438]  And I figured if anybody would know, Dick would.
[00:25:04.518 --> 00:25:07.220]  So I called Dick out at Rogue Manor in Virginia.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.082]  I told him what had happened that day, and he kind of laughed at the other end.
[00:25:11.162 --> 00:25:13.903]  And I said, Dick, do you have any idea why they would do this?
[00:25:13.983 --> 00:25:18.085]  And he said, well, you know, I'm out of it now, and I'm out of touch with all that.
[00:25:18.145 --> 00:25:19.646]  But he said, I got a pretty good idea.
[00:25:19.666 --> 00:25:21.387]  And I said, well, give me yours.
[00:25:21.407 --> 00:25:24.488]  Because I said, I'm lost as to why this happened.
[00:25:24.568 --> 00:25:27.610]  And Dick was right when he said to me, they didn't see you coming.
[00:25:28.687 --> 00:25:42.710]  Because the CIA's job is to gather intelligence and then present what they predict is going to happen, and clearly they didn't see me winning in Minnesota, and I think they were very much concerned, is this a trend?
[00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.011]  Are there going to be more independent governors?
[00:25:45.031 --> 00:25:54.513]  That's what's happening here in the country of the United States, which is also interesting because the CIA is not to be operative within the United States, according to their charter.
[00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:57.374]  They're supposed to only be outside the United States.
[00:25:57.854 --> 00:26:04.838]  But now, in the name of anti-terror, they are trying to basically set up offices in major U.S.
[00:26:04.878 --> 00:26:09.240]  cities, and that's even come out, though they haven't passed a law in Congress saying they can do it.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.861]  Well, let's remember this happened before 9-11.
[00:26:13.742 --> 00:26:14.343]  Absolutely.
[00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:17.204]  You know, 9-11 was a couple years later.
[00:26:17.264 --> 00:26:24.848]  I got elected in 98 and took office in 99, so this was, you know, within about a month and a half when I first took office in the year 1999.
[00:26:26.528 --> 00:26:28.591]  Why do you think they tried to deny it at first?
[00:26:29.953 --> 00:26:30.474]  I don't know.
[00:26:30.814 --> 00:26:31.796]  Well, you know them.
[00:26:32.777 --> 00:26:35.060]  They don't admit anything right away, you know.
[00:26:35.821 --> 00:26:40.848]  Only when they're cornered will they give you even a partial admittance to anything.
[00:26:40.868 --> 00:26:43.272]  That's the way they certainly operate, I would guess.
[00:26:44.130 --> 00:27:00.076]  Well, I have a sneaky suspicion they were trying to develop a relationship with you and then basically try to handle you or see if they could co-opt you and see if you were amenable, but then they should have at least given you their fake cover names and acted friendly.
[00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:04.618]  Frankly, I'm not very impressed, generally, with their analysts and the things that they do.
[00:27:05.158 --> 00:27:11.080]  I mean, they are just now figuring out that the mainstream media is dying and the alternative media is exploding.
[00:27:13.911 --> 00:27:29.006]  Well, probably because they have much more control over the mainstream media and didn't realize that the alternative media could rise up, but with the rise of the internet and things like that, which they don't have full control of right now, I could see that would be a great problem for them.
[00:27:29.186 --> 00:27:32.129]  The book also gets into your wife finding a bugging device?
[00:27:33.178 --> 00:27:38.960]  Well, yeah, it was very interesting because they came into my home, my actual home.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.803]  Now, you've got the governor's residence, which you use on certain formal occasions, and you're certainly entitled to live there.
[00:27:45.223 --> 00:27:46.364]  But I chose not to.
[00:27:46.444 --> 00:27:52.286]  I mean, I'd use it for formal things, but I still maintained and had our horse ranch out in Maple Grove, Minnesota.
[00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:56.908]  But what they did is they came in and they installed a red phone.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.701]  Which was, I understood why.
[00:27:59.721 --> 00:28:09.303]  It was a phone where if it was merely knocked off the hook, the local police would respond and would be there immediately, even though I had a guard trailer out in front of my ranch and all that.
[00:28:09.803 --> 00:28:26.987]  It's done for security reasons, but what was interesting was the entire time that I was governor, we had phone troubles all the time in my private phone, to where you'd hear a lot of clicking and a lot of this and that going on, and it got to the point where even my in-laws would call up and they would hear it.
[00:28:27.527 --> 00:28:28.668]  We're good to go.
[00:28:49.128 --> 00:28:52.769]  He kind of raised his eyebrows, and I won't say his name, but he said, oh yeah.
[00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.231]  He said, I used to have to put those things in periodically by government orders.
[00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:04.274]  And the other thing was, after they removed the red phone, we had real bad phone trouble.
[00:29:04.294 --> 00:29:11.897]  And when the actual phone company came out, they made the quote to us, we don't know what went on here, but we've never seen a setup like this.
[00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:14.298]  And it's all, you know, totally crazy here.
[00:29:14.638 --> 00:29:17.339]  When they tried to get me back onto my regular phone system.
[00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:18.779]  It's all in the book.
[00:29:18.819 --> 00:29:20.340]  Don't start the revolution without me.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.820]  We haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.781]  We're going to get into Jesse Ventura's view on the police state, the Patriot Act, the war, President Bush.
[00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:28.101]  Is he going to run for president?
[00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:31.262]  Or is he going to wait until this disaster is over and run in four years?
[00:29:31.282 --> 00:29:36.283]  Because whoever gets it now is going to be in deep trouble as the deep recession sets in.
[00:29:36.483 --> 00:29:39.404]  There is so much more coming up on the other side.
[00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:41.484]  We'll fire out some websites of the governor as well.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:47.545]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:51.272]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.058 --> 00:29:56.240]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.324]  I'm the Neutral Medical Report here on Genesis.
[00:29:58.743 --> 00:30:01.724]  Allison's Natural Antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:30:01.784 --> 00:30:02.464]  is the real thing.
[00:30:02.544 --> 00:30:09.426]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:30:09.546 --> 00:30:20.450]  Allison molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.831]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies and
[00:30:24.091 --> 00:30:24.751]  We're good to go.
[00:30:54.275 --> 00:30:56.817]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[00:30:57.218 --> 00:31:00.481]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:31:00.961 --> 00:31:04.404]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:31:04.744 --> 00:31:11.831]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:31:12.171 --> 00:31:15.433]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:31:15.713 --> 00:31:19.555]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:31:19.895 --> 00:31:30.980]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.582]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:31:35.822 --> 00:31:37.683]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[00:31:37.943 --> 00:31:44.185]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[00:31:44.545 --> 00:31:47.847]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[00:31:48.027 --> 00:31:49.107]  We do not charge for shipping.
[00:31:49.147 --> 00:31:50.127]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:50.508]  Hi neighbor.
[00:31:57.668 --> 00:31:59.368]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[00:31:59.808 --> 00:32:02.909]  We've tried to give you knowledge to help you prepare for rough times.
[00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:08.190]  There's the worldwide famine and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.811]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:16.932]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees along with huge crop failures from all-time record water shortages.
[00:32:17.652 --> 00:32:21.313]  You know they're turning food into fuel with corn ethanol plants.
[00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:25.976]  If we do not control our food, food will be used to control us.
[00:32:26.497 --> 00:32:31.661]  Food control has been the plan historically in every enslaved population and is the plan for America.
[00:32:32.341 --> 00:32:40.588]  The only value of the knowledge you have to take control of your food is if you choose to get a supply while you still have the freedom to choose.
[00:32:41.069 --> 00:32:42.310]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.650]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:12.823]  Let's get into immigration with Governor Ventura.
[00:33:13.744 --> 00:33:15.886]  New book just came out yesterday.
[00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.709]  Don't start a revolution without me.
[00:33:17.749 --> 00:33:21.273]  He kicked off his tour on Larry King last night and he's coming here second.
[00:33:21.293 --> 00:33:22.274]  We're honored to have him.
[00:33:23.175 --> 00:33:28.762]  Let's go ahead and play a clip, about a minute clip from Larry King live last night with Governor Ventura.
[00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:34.414]  Two days ago, I just finished a film called Woodshop up in Boulder, Colorado.
[00:33:34.454 --> 00:33:36.996]  So I'm back doing a little acting again, which is a lot of fun.
[00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:42.640]  But I'm living now at least half the year down in the Baja in Mexico, Larry.
[00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:49.466]  I live one hour from pavement and one hour from electricity, about 850 miles down there.
[00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:55.271]  And amazingly, I live with those brown-skinned people that frighten Lou Dobbs so much.
[00:33:56.111 --> 00:33:59.794]  I mean, there's these people that just strike fear into Lou Dobbs.
[00:34:00.335 --> 00:34:02.076]  I can assure Lou they're great people.
[00:34:02.156 --> 00:34:03.037]  I live among them.
[00:34:03.237 --> 00:34:06.199]  Have you removed yourself from conventional society?
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.881]  In a way, yeah, because I'm off the grid.
[00:34:09.802 --> 00:34:11.243]  I live totally in a house.
[00:34:11.263 --> 00:34:12.424]  This is obviously by choice.
[00:34:12.704 --> 00:34:14.345]  Oh yes, absolutely by choice.
[00:34:14.365 --> 00:34:14.445]  Why?
[00:34:14.486 --> 00:34:15.626]  Why did you leave St.
[00:34:15.666 --> 00:34:16.947]  Paul and Minneapolis?
[00:34:17.268 --> 00:34:22.712]  Well, because I'm at the age, Larry, where I'm young enough yet to need another adventure.
[00:34:23.479 --> 00:34:26.660]  I'm young enough yet to need another adventure, absolutely.
[00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:31.443]  I lust after adventure, tied down to this radio microphone, but it is an adventure.
[00:34:31.463 --> 00:34:33.483]  I'm going to talk to Jesse Ventura.
[00:34:34.704 --> 00:34:35.504]  Look, immigration.
[00:34:35.764 --> 00:34:36.805]  I like going to Mexico.
[00:34:36.845 --> 00:34:38.986]  I like going to El Salvador.
[00:34:39.026 --> 00:34:41.807]  I like going... I mean, I'm not afraid of the brown people.
[00:34:42.567 --> 00:34:43.768]  I think Lou Dobbs' point
[00:34:44.458 --> 00:34:53.601]  Is that it is driving down the wages, it is bankrupting the hospitals, and he's married to a Hispanic lady, he just never plays that card, so he must not be too scared of the brown people.
[00:34:54.241 --> 00:34:59.902]  I mean, I don't think he's somebody who hates the Latin Americans, but I also understand your view.
[00:34:59.922 --> 00:35:06.444]  I don't think they're scary people, just economically, it's putting a lot of pressure, because we do have a welfare state.
[00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:09.165]  If we didn't have this welfare state, then it wouldn't be as bad.
[00:35:09.245 --> 00:35:10.025]  Governor, any comments?
[00:35:10.665 --> 00:35:12.207]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:35:12.227 --> 00:35:17.314]  The point is, blame the people who created our system, don't blame the poor Mexicans.
[00:35:18.195 --> 00:35:23.862]  You know, if you want to stop illegal immigration, then get down hard on the people that hire them.
[00:35:24.674 --> 00:35:26.556]  It's the same as the war on drugs.
[00:35:26.636 --> 00:35:27.977]  We fight it the wrong way.
[00:35:29.238 --> 00:35:30.999]  Illegal immigration is the same thing.
[00:35:31.019 --> 00:35:33.160]  You can't fight it on the supply side.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.362]  You have to fight it on the demand side.
[00:35:35.882 --> 00:35:42.988]  But, now, flipping the coin too, let's also remember, if we ban all these people from coming up here,
[00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:54.484]  I hope that you're prepared to pay double or triple for your food, because the price is going to skyrocket, because as I said last night, if you're going to make me go out there and pick it, I'm going to charge you $200 an hour.
[00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:08.301]  Well, I know that that's always been what the corporations have said, and certainly there would be some increase, but really it's the inflation of the devaluing dollar right now that's driving up the food price.
[00:36:09.022 --> 00:36:15.548]  Yeah, but it would also be if you don't have these cheap workers picking it for the price that they're willing to work for.
[00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:20.942]  Again, if you're going to ask me to go out and do it, I'm going to charge you a whole lot more money.
[00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:38.598]  If you look at most the cost, it is the fertilizer, it's the equipment, it's the shipping, and then it's the added retail expense and the markup.
[00:36:39.459 --> 00:36:44.921]  The actual cost of the food is tiny, and even if you doubled it, it would be negligible.
[00:36:44.961 --> 00:36:46.461]  But I do see your point, Governor.
[00:36:47.282 --> 00:36:48.542]  Look, here's the problem.
[00:36:48.622 --> 00:36:49.403]  I live in Texas.
[00:36:49.623 --> 00:36:51.343]  You're from Minnesota, but you've been in L.A.
[00:36:51.383 --> 00:36:53.524]  and California a lot, and you live in Mexico.
[00:36:53.584 --> 00:36:54.785]  It's great to go down to Mexico.
[00:36:55.585 --> 00:37:08.858]  My problem is my wife speaks Spanish, so she hears the stuff on the radio, on the Spanish stations, she reads it in the magazine, she tells me about it, and it's stuff like, we're taking over your country, this used to be Mexico, we're going to get you.
[00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:15.585]  Now that's not the majority of the Mexicans, but that's what Scott Lou Dobbs upset, cause see his wife's Hispanic, so he hears about it.
[00:37:16.305 --> 00:37:23.930]  Well, and the point being is they're going to take over our country because it belongs to Mexico in the first place.
[00:37:24.411 --> 00:37:25.852]  Well, I got news for you.
[00:37:25.872 --> 00:37:27.533]  Offense isn't going to be the answer.
[00:37:28.732 --> 00:37:39.079]  Because the Great Wall of China, which is the greatest man-made wall to stop someone in history, in 1644 was broken through by the Mongols.
[00:37:39.219 --> 00:37:39.959]  You're right.
[00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:49.245]  So I just hope that this fence that they build, I hope that they make it tourist-friendly, so that we can at least make some tourism money off it.
[00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:54.729]  On the flip side, when they build this fence, I'm going to climb it and protest the other way.
[00:37:55.638 --> 00:38:03.301]  Because, Alex, remember this, a fence today to keep people out, ten years from now might be to keep you in.
[00:38:03.661 --> 00:38:16.987]  Well, I love how you think, and that's the point I've made, is that we do need to prosecute the employers who are, you know, hiring people for three bucks an hour with no insurance, no nothing, and then depressing our entire
[00:38:17.819 --> 00:38:18.039]  Exactly.
[00:38:18.059 --> 00:38:19.900]  What that does is turn us into East Berlin.
[00:38:20.061 --> 00:38:22.462]  And I don't particularly want to live in the old East Berlin.
[00:38:40.043 --> 00:38:40.403]  Boy!
[00:38:42.065 --> 00:38:43.806]  Again, you'd have to come down.
[00:38:43.846 --> 00:38:47.889]  The only reason I believe they're all coming up here is for economic reasons.
[00:38:47.969 --> 00:38:48.570]  Absolutely.
[00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.071]  The jobs are up here.
[00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:51.652]  It's available to them.
[00:38:51.753 --> 00:39:02.501]  So if you're going to attack and stop it, you have to stop it at the hiring and you have to make it so that the people who hire the illegals are not in a position to do so, that they need to hire people here.
[00:39:02.862 --> 00:39:06.825]  And then you have to convince our people to do the jobs that the illegals are doing.
[00:39:07.525 --> 00:39:08.005]  I think so.
[00:39:25.295 --> 00:39:34.205]  I know, we've tried to plant orange trees and other stuff, and then we can't do it, and then the Mexicans come over that just magically, it's like they're wizards or something.
[00:39:34.325 --> 00:39:36.767]  Yeah, and they're the same on golf courses.
[00:39:37.648 --> 00:39:39.290]  Your golf course is going to be beautiful.
[00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:48.059]  So, you know, I think that rather than setting up this East German type defense system or putting our military at the border,
[00:39:48.539 --> 00:40:00.793]  I think we would do far much better to try to help, and I hate to say this too, if the economy were to rise up in Mexico, I think you would see the end of the Mexican illegal immigration up to here.
[00:40:00.953 --> 00:40:03.296]  Well that brings me, Governor, into my next point.
[00:40:04.462 --> 00:40:07.763]  And Mexico has more billionaires per capita than any other nation.
[00:40:07.803 --> 00:40:14.826]  They have triple the natural resources, oil, gold, timber, just everything down there that we have in the lower 48.
[00:40:16.366 --> 00:40:20.708]  But they have this corrupt elite that's made deals with our elite to use the U.S.
[00:40:21.048 --> 00:40:26.810]  as a dumping ground for their criminals, for their poor, for people to come across and have the babies, the anchor babies.
[00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:27.771]  The average cost, $12,000.
[00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:29.211]  I think so.
[00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:56.810]  And now the Fed is going to take over four other federal regulatory agencies and have absolute financial power when they're bailing out their own private member banks with our money and devaluing the dollar.
[00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:02.513]  Your take, Governor, on what's happening right now with our economy and these private banks being bailed out?
[00:41:03.134 --> 00:41:04.815]  Well, you know, it's wrong.
[00:41:05.355 --> 00:41:09.558]  But, you know, how do you stop it, you know, when the powers to be are all in bed with them?
[00:41:10.385 --> 00:41:14.268]  And that's the difficult thing and why I'm calling for a revolution in my book.
[00:41:14.328 --> 00:41:26.699]  It's time to take our country back, and the only way you're truly going to do that is to get both, is to depower both the Democrat and Republican parties, who to me are each as bad as each other.
[00:41:26.719 --> 00:41:31.423]  You know, the same lobbyists lobby both sides, so they got both sides covered.
[00:41:31.483 --> 00:41:32.724]  It doesn't matter who wins.
[00:41:35.123 --> 00:41:38.466]  So, you were able to at least do something in Minnesota.
[00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:40.388]  I mean, what are your recommendations?
[00:41:40.408 --> 00:41:41.048]  This is the people.
[00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:42.890]  You say, don't start a revolution without me.
[00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.412]  I mean, what are your... Stop.
[00:41:45.653 --> 00:41:47.574]  Vote with your heart and your conscience.
[00:41:47.654 --> 00:41:52.879]  Stop being a lemming and start voting for people that don't belong to these two parties.
[00:41:52.979 --> 00:41:55.902]  And I know people say, well, that's impossible.
[00:41:56.703 --> 00:41:58.444]  You know, your vote is wasted.
[00:41:58.504 --> 00:41:59.185]  No, it's not.
[00:41:59.745 --> 00:42:06.850]  A wasted vote is not voting your heart and conscience for the candidate that you think would do the best job for you.
[00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:24.222]  And if we would all break this mold of somehow thinking that, you know, and stop the Democrats and Republicans and their two-party dictatorship that's going on in this country, and start voting for third-party candidates, start electing people that are not part of this system that we have.
[00:42:24.833 --> 00:42:34.798]  We were talking during a break and you said Obama's the best of the three, and I tend to agree, but it's kind of like the best of three latrines.
[00:42:34.838 --> 00:42:40.662]  He is for the establishment on every issue, but he did vote right on the war, so we've got to hand him that.
[00:42:41.062 --> 00:42:46.845]  But your take on this race, Barack Obama, Hillary, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran, McCain?
[00:42:47.745 --> 00:42:57.952]  Well, first of all, McCain has already said that we'll stay in Iraq for 100 years if we have to, so that eliminates him from any consideration on my part.
[00:42:59.173 --> 00:43:00.994]  The problem with Hillary is this.
[00:43:01.595 --> 00:43:06.198]  If you count when George H.W.
[00:43:06.238 --> 00:43:08.159]  Bush was Vice President with Reagan,
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:14.445]  We have had only, in the administration, we've had only Bushes and Clintons since 1980 now.
[00:43:14.505 --> 00:43:15.746]  That's 28 years.
[00:43:15.846 --> 00:43:17.227]  Are we a dual monarchy?
[00:43:18.368 --> 00:43:26.174]  Because if Hillary gets elected for two terms, that's another eight years of Clintons, which will be more than half of my adult life.
[00:43:28.076 --> 00:43:35.682]  I'm 36 years old, and we've had Clintons and Bushes in the White House since over half of the time that I've been allowed to vote.
[00:43:36.573 --> 00:43:37.274]  That's a good point.
[00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:40.936]  When Reagan got in with his VP, how old were you in 1980?
[00:43:41.056 --> 00:43:44.279]  In 1980, I would have been what?
[00:43:44.519 --> 00:43:45.160]  I was born in 51.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.661]  So, I don't know.
[00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:48.242]  Do the math.
[00:43:48.322 --> 00:43:50.784]  I've been up since 430.
[00:43:50.904 --> 00:43:52.165]  That's more than half your life.
[00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:52.805]  Yeah.
[00:43:53.786 --> 00:43:56.648]  It's more than half of my life.
[00:43:56.688 --> 00:44:01.592]  We've had Bush's or Clinton's only part of the White House or the administration.
[00:44:03.394 --> 00:44:05.476]  I agree with you, and that brings me into the next subject.
[00:44:20.098 --> 00:44:30.172]  You have boldly spoken out, as a soldier yourself, understanding how firearms operate, that the Kennedy situation with JFK is a cover-up.
[00:44:30.533 --> 00:44:35.159]  I know you've been on a book tour, but the BBC came out on Monday
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:55.471]  Uh, with video footage and photos from the Ambassador Hotel and they had, what, four different former CIA colleagues watch the film footage and say, yeah, that's the known CIA officers from Southeast Asia and the known CIA officers that on his deathbed
[00:44:56.704 --> 00:44:59.488]  E. Howard Hunt said we're involved killing JFK.
[00:44:59.869 --> 00:45:00.870]  He was running the operation.
[00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:02.993]  I, by the way, folks, have the only video of that.
[00:45:03.013 --> 00:45:03.894]  It hasn't been released yet.
[00:45:03.914 --> 00:45:05.977]  I'm going to put it in a film I'm making about JFK.
[00:45:05.997 --> 00:45:06.839]  I got it from his son, St.
[00:45:06.859 --> 00:45:07.820]  John Hunt.
[00:45:09.295 --> 00:45:12.798]  So now we even have the film footage of them there at the Ambassador Hotel.
[00:45:13.399 --> 00:45:18.583]  We have this individual, Caesar, shooting him in the back four times.
[00:45:19.864 --> 00:45:21.365]  You're talking Robert now, right?
[00:45:21.525 --> 00:45:22.506]  Yes, Robert Kennedy.
[00:45:23.367 --> 00:45:25.048]  So I'm just giving the listeners some background here.
[00:45:25.449 --> 00:45:31.173]  But now, with Robert Kennedy, even the BBC and NBC are saying the CIA killed him.
[00:45:31.554 --> 00:45:33.075]  A. Are you aware of those revelations?
[00:45:33.315 --> 00:45:36.258]  And B. Your comment, not just on JFK, but RFK.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:57.706]  Well, I certainly have studied the JFK murder much more than the RFK murder, because when I was wrestling, it was interesting that I flew a lot, and so one day I picked up a book on the JFK, one of the conspiracy books, and I got hooked on it, because it's far more intriguing than anything Tom Clancy could even write about.
[00:45:58.486 --> 00:46:01.887]  And so I've studied it for years and years.
[00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:09.748]  I believe totally that Howard Hunt and the same people that did Watergate are the ones who were instrumental in killing John F. Kennedy.
[00:46:10.229 --> 00:46:12.229]  What I found interesting, though, is this.
[00:46:12.749 --> 00:46:19.911]  Do you remember when LBJ announced that he would not seek, nor would he accept, his nomination for a second term as president?
[00:46:19.971 --> 00:46:20.191]  In 1967, yes, sir.
[00:46:21.651 --> 00:46:22.192]  Exactly.
[00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:28.642]  Isn't it, do you think it's just coincidence that a mere three days later Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated?
[00:46:32.503 --> 00:46:41.189]  Absolutely, but now, the coroner in LA always said he was shot four times in the back with a different caliber than what Serhan Serhan was shooting.
[00:46:41.509 --> 00:46:46.853]  Serhan only got one shot off before they grabbed him and aimed the gun at the floor and he still squeezed off the rounds.
[00:46:47.113 --> 00:46:52.296]  And then you've got this known CIA operative who was behind
[00:46:53.517 --> 00:47:05.643]  Robert Kennedy when he then got shot three times in the back and once in the back of the head and now we have the film footage analyzed and the CIA colleagues who worked with the three operatives who were on film there.
[00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:06.883]  I mean it's open and shut.
[00:47:07.804 --> 00:47:18.249]  I think so and I think John F. Kennedy to me if you take that also from a standpoint of very basic common sense
[00:47:19.151 --> 00:47:34.515]  Okay, they want us to believe that Oswald was this disgruntled little Marine who became Marxist-Leninist, ran off to Russia, defected, married a Russian woman, came back, hated our policy on Cuba, decided to get famous and shoot the President, right?
[00:47:35.555 --> 00:47:36.215]  That's incredible.
[00:47:36.795 --> 00:47:44.817]  Well, first of all, if that's true, then why would anything have to be locked up because of national security?
[00:47:45.606 --> 00:48:00.599]  Because I was a Navy SEAL with a top-secret security clearance when I was in, and I certainly knew a few things, but I didn't know that much that would require the majority of everything, including my tax records, to be locked up because of national security.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:10.888]  But now, if you were involved in a secret CIA, shall we say, espionage program to a false defection over to Russia,
[00:48:11.508 --> 00:48:16.750]  Well, then certainly you would have knowledge and documentation that probably should be locked up.
[00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:17.870]  Well, here's the proof!
[00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:18.730]  Here's the proof!
[00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:23.271]  Three years ago, because it is 40-something years later, they did release a CIA control number.
[00:48:23.531 --> 00:48:29.573]  He was at the U-2 spy base in Japan, and then when he defected back to the U.S., they didn't even debrief him.
[00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:35.375]  They just let him come right back into the country with his bride, as if he'd just defected and been an evil traitor.
[00:48:35.535 --> 00:48:36.555]  They just let him back in.
[00:48:37.055 --> 00:48:45.562]  Well, actually, that isn't quite true, because he disappeared in Amsterdam for a couple days and it was there, I believe, that he went to a CIA safe house.
[00:48:45.582 --> 00:48:48.164]  No, I know, but I mean, officially, they say they just let him in.
[00:48:48.184 --> 00:48:48.544]  You're right.
[00:48:48.624 --> 00:48:49.244]  Exactly.
[00:48:49.384 --> 00:48:58.471]  Officially, they say he just got in, but if you follow it closely, you'll realize that he spent a couple days in Holland, and I think that's where it took place, at a safe house.
[00:48:58.932 --> 00:49:02.114]  Governor Ventura, you, in your book, talking about...
[00:49:03.835 --> 00:49:22.855]  With a fake news headline saying, while independent presidential candidate Jesse Ventura is in a coma for the fourth consecutive day, clung to life with family members gathered at his side, a White House press spokesman denied mounting allegations that accused assassin Raul Santana was part of a wider plot, one entry reads.
[00:49:23.136 --> 00:49:25.298]  What are you saying at the end of the book with that statement?
[00:49:25.778 --> 00:49:30.459]  Well, what I'm saying is, the book is factual all the way till the last chapter.
[00:49:30.739 --> 00:49:35.780]  And I'm kind of throwing it out there, I hope I don't ruin it for everybody, but the last chapter is fiction.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.741]  And I use myself as an example, and here's what I'm saying.
[00:49:40.341 --> 00:49:53.064]  I believe very strongly that if an independent candidate like myself, a rogue, were to get into the President's race legitimately, if the polls believed it looked like he had a chance to win,
[00:49:53.684 --> 00:50:09.933]  I believe that that candidate would either be physically assassinated or would be assassinated credibility-wise or in some manner by our government because I do not believe they would ever allow a true independent or a citizen to become President of the United States.
[00:50:10.453 --> 00:50:14.996]  And I would say, and I say this in all seriousness, watch out Barack Obama.
[00:50:16.468 --> 00:50:17.190]  Absolutely.
[00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:20.616]  Incredible revelations from Jesse the Mind Ventura, Governor.
[00:50:20.857 --> 00:50:28.091]  Ventura, final segment coming up, sir, but not just the book, Don't Start a Revolution Without Me, any personal websites or other places you want to give out?
[00:50:29.615 --> 00:50:31.137]  Uh, no, not really.
[00:50:31.217 --> 00:50:37.763]  Just, again, I look forward to people hopefully waking up in this country and stop being a lemming.
[00:50:37.983 --> 00:50:39.024]  Stop being lemmings.
[00:50:39.645 --> 00:50:42.308]  Shows like yours, Alex, can help prevent this.
[00:50:42.608 --> 00:50:47.473]  Well, let's talk about how we prevent it, how we stand up to the oligarchy on the other side.
[00:50:47.593 --> 00:50:50.776]  Final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:50:51.096 --> 00:50:52.938]  I'm Alex Jones at PollWars.com.
[00:50:54.528 --> 00:51:07.340]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:18.350]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[00:52:54.514 --> 00:52:54.954]  Alright, Dad.
[00:52:55.235 --> 00:52:56.236]  Let me get this straight.
[00:52:56.496 --> 00:52:58.578]  Uncivil Liberties takes place in the future, right?
[00:52:58.698 --> 00:52:59.559]  Like Star Wars?
[00:52:59.719 --> 00:53:00.360]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.541]  Slightly in the future.
[00:53:01.741 --> 00:53:02.542]  Wait a second.
[00:53:02.822 --> 00:53:05.845]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[00:53:06.085 --> 00:53:07.006]  Alright, Einstein.
[00:53:07.146 --> 00:53:09.168]  But it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[00:53:09.328 --> 00:53:15.955]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[00:53:16.215 --> 00:53:19.337]  Okay, so don't tell me, the government's the bad guys again?
[00:53:19.497 --> 00:53:20.358]  Yep, that's right.
[00:53:20.618 --> 00:53:23.000]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.121]  Not exactly.
[00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:26.363]  I know, you're Chewbacca!
[00:53:26.523 --> 00:53:35.429]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[00:53:35.609 --> 00:53:38.211]  Wait a second, they can't track us, it's a free country!
[00:53:38.752 --> 00:53:39.292]  Exactly.
[00:53:40.322 --> 00:53:43.946]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[00:54:15.024 --> 00:54:30.910]  As we chronicle the criminal activities of the New World Order, which is just simply the big private central banks that own the military industrial complex and the dominant media, who are on out-of-control power trips, Governor Ventura has agreed to stay 15 minutes graciously into the next hour.
[00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:31.370]  And why?
[00:54:32.285 --> 00:54:38.410]  I interviewed him about a year and a half ago, and he got into some questions of 9-11, but he said he wanted to research it more.
[00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:49.419]  He told me he read 16 books on that subject and others, while he's had time down at his summer or winter home in Mexico, and he said he'd be happy to get into 9-11.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.403]  He brought it up, so he's staying with us a little bit longer to have time to get into that.
[00:54:55.524 --> 00:54:57.065]  Governor Ventura, you've got the floor.
[00:54:57.125 --> 00:54:58.386]  Give us your take on 9-11.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.782]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me state this.
[00:55:01.802 --> 00:55:13.372]  You know, being ex-military, when the attack initially took place and I was governor, I went on a very focused tunnel vision mode that our country had been attacked and what the hell do we need to do to repel it?
[00:55:13.432 --> 00:55:19.398]  So, I today kicked myself because at that point in time, I had a position of power
[00:55:20.178 --> 00:55:41.533]  And if I would have, you know, not been the way I was, the way all of us were so shocked when it happened, that in that position of power I could have raised a lot more questions at that time about the things that went down that day, and where today when I raise those questions naturally it doesn't quite have the impact that it would have had back then.
[00:55:42.334 --> 00:55:47.057]  But to me it's questions that are not being answered and haven't been answered about 9-11.
[00:55:48.379 --> 00:55:57.754]  And, you know, first and foremost, I think, is the fact that, okay, in New York City and Manhattan, two planes struck two buildings.
[00:55:58.294 --> 00:56:00.318]  We'll all be in agreement on that, I think.
[00:56:01.087 --> 00:56:04.769]  But how is it that a third building fell five hours later?
[00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:08.190]  You know, what they call World Trade Center Building No.
[00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:08.190]  7.
[00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:25.298]  And for people that think, well, it was just a smaller building, it was 51 stories high, which of course in Manhattan probably isn't that big of a building, but if you were to move that building to Austin, Texas, or to Minneapolis, Minnesota, it would be a huge building.
[00:56:25.378 --> 00:56:29.700]  How could this building just implode into its own footprint five hours later?
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:31.601]  That's my first question.
[00:56:31.641 --> 00:56:34.922]  The 9-11 Commission never even brought it up.
[00:56:35.002 --> 00:56:40.043]  They didn't devote even one page to that in their big volume of investigation.
[00:56:40.704 --> 00:56:45.885]  Number two, how could those buildings fall at the speed of gravity?
[00:56:46.986 --> 00:56:53.468]  You know, if you put a stopwatch on them, both of those World Trade Center buildings were on the ground in ten seconds.
[00:56:54.241 --> 00:56:55.081]  How can that be?
[00:56:55.582 --> 00:57:03.266]  If you took a billiard ball and dropped it from the height of the World Trade Center in a vacuum, it would hit the ground in 9.3 seconds.
[00:57:03.946 --> 00:57:13.471]  And if you took that same billiard ball and dropped it 10 stories at a time and merely stopped it and started it, it would take 30 seconds.
[00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:23.296]  If you dropped it every floor of the World Trade Center to the ground, simply stopping and starting it on gravity, it would take over 100 seconds to reach the ground.
[00:57:23.576 --> 00:57:24.096]  Amazing.
[00:57:24.496 --> 00:57:30.638]  And yet they're telling us that, and I could go on now after studying it, the planes hit the building.
[00:57:30.758 --> 00:57:31.138]  Okay.
[00:57:32.298 --> 00:57:37.719]  Jet fuel is four-fifths kerosene, which is not a hot burning fuel.
[00:57:38.099 --> 00:57:46.081]  And they want us to believe that it melted these steel-structured girders and caused these buildings to pancake, collapse to the ground.
[00:57:46.581 --> 00:57:51.182]  I was on the site within two weeks after it happened, and I saw none of these pancakes.
[00:57:51.582 --> 00:57:57.264]  Wouldn't they all be piled up in a huge mass on the ground, and yet everything was blown into dust?
[00:57:58.684 --> 00:57:59.464]  Aerosolized.
[00:58:00.465 --> 00:58:05.786]  You know, and when you look at it from that aspect, none of it makes any sense.
[00:58:05.866 --> 00:58:10.207]  If you apply common sense again to it, it does not make any sense.
[00:58:10.327 --> 00:58:16.949]  Never before in the annals of history has a fire caused a steel-structured building to fall to the ground.
[00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:18.510]  Governor Ventura?
[00:58:20.384 --> 00:58:21.964]  As the way three of them did.
[00:58:22.045 --> 00:58:23.245]  Governor Ventura, stay with us.
[00:58:23.305 --> 00:58:24.185]  Seventy-second break.
[00:58:24.205 --> 00:58:25.425]  We're coming right back to you.
[00:58:25.705 --> 00:58:26.405]  Coming in hot.
[00:58:27.406 --> 00:58:31.567]  And as an underwater demolitions expert, I want to get your take on explosives.
[00:58:31.587 --> 00:58:32.247]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:35.227 --> 00:58:40.049]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:46.150]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:48.351]  A New World Order.
[00:58:49.051 --> 00:58:53.114]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:58:53.214 --> 00:58:56.757]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.797 --> 00:58:58.979]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.579 --> 00:59:02.021]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.761 --> 00:59:10.087]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:18.110]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:22.031]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.431 --> 00:59:24.892]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.992 --> 00:59:26.132]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.152 --> 00:59:26.912]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.932 --> 00:59:28.012]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.212 --> 00:59:28.933]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.193 --> 00:59:30.313]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:59:39.057 --> 00:59:39.418]  Endgame.
[00:59:39.818 --> 00:59:41.339]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:41.859 --> 00:59:43.080]  You have been warned.
[00:59:47.044 --> 00:59:48.965]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.445 --> 00:59:52.208]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.018 --> 00:59:59.279]  We're good.
[01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:30.793]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:31.954 --> 01:00:34.857]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest for another 15 minutes or so.
[01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:38.280]  The new book just came out yesterday, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.885]  As part of your SEAL training, you first went through underwater demolitions or frog teams, didn't you, sir?
[01:00:45.466 --> 01:00:56.014]  And so having a knowledge of controlled demolition, we've had a lot of engineers, physicists, architects look at it and say that even if jet fuel could have weakened the steel, it would have had a
[01:00:57.122 --> 01:01:00.164]  Collapse where it fell over sideways or certain parts crinkled.
[01:01:00.384 --> 01:01:17.137]  It wouldn't have aerosolized and fallen straight down with pyroclastic flows of steel blown in one and two story pieces sheared off at 45 degree angles with perfect blast points shooting out hundreds of feet and dust shooting out miles.
[01:01:17.477 --> 01:01:21.760]  Can you comment on that with your background, Governor, in underwater demolitions as a frogman?
[01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:22.641]  Sure.
[01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:24.904]  First of all, it's the same training.
[01:01:24.944 --> 01:01:29.271]  You know, people, for some reason, want to separate the UDT from the SEAL.
[01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.174]  And it's all the same.
[01:01:31.274 --> 01:01:35.921]  Initially, it's called BUDS, which is Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL Training.
[01:01:36.525 --> 01:01:44.434]  And when you graduate from BUDS, you're fully qualified as a demolition expert, whether you go to a UDT team or to a SEAL team.
[01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:58.449]  It's basically the needs of the Navy, and actually they would generally send the better swimmers to the UDT teams because they tend to work a little bit more in the water, and every class your top swimmers will go to the UDT teams.
[01:01:58.909 --> 01:01:59.229]  We're good.
[01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:24.612]  Am I a demolition expert on a controlled demolition to drop a building?
[01:02:24.632 --> 01:02:25.172]  No.
[01:02:25.632 --> 01:02:35.076]  Because our standard policy when we would figure out how to blow something up, we would use the slide rule and then we always had a standard rule when in doubt, overload.
[01:02:36.073 --> 01:02:43.377]  So, uh, what that means is when you figure out how to blow it up, throw on an extra haversack of C4 just to make sure you get the job done.
[01:02:43.878 --> 01:02:49.841]  Because in our type of demolition work, in warfare, you're not worried about whether everything blows up.
[01:02:49.881 --> 01:02:56.785]  You don't worry about a controlled demolition, which is what they would use to drop a building so that it wouldn't affect any of the other buildings.
[01:02:56.805 --> 01:02:59.166]  My point is, is that you've worked with explosives.
[01:02:59.206 --> 01:03:00.047]  What does it look like to you?
[01:03:00.808 --> 01:03:14.550]  Well, upon looking at the film in super slow motion and the way the building fell and comparing that to the way that they do like a controlled demolition of a hotel in Las Vegas, they both fell identical.
[01:03:15.342 --> 01:03:34.579]  And it just is beyond me, and again, I kicked myself for when it initially happened that the light didn't go off, but again, I was so shocked that this thing had even taken place that I, you know, again, I apologize for not being more aware, but I don't think I was alone as were most of the people in the United States.
[01:03:34.659 --> 01:03:35.899]  Well, what about seven?
[01:03:35.919 --> 01:03:40.700]  I mean, you talk about the free-fall speed of the 110-story towers at the speed of gravity.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:48.922]  Seven falls at the speed of gravity, and it's the classic where you see the penthouse fall, the central beam they blow out, then they blow the side beams, it collapses.
[01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:52.643]  The CIA, the FBI, Defense Intelligence, we're all based there.
[01:03:52.683 --> 01:03:56.344]  We have videos of police saying, get back, they're going to blow it up.
[01:03:56.404 --> 01:03:58.944]  Firemen saying, get back, the government said they're going to blow it up.
[01:03:59.184 --> 01:04:00.624]  Then they say, oh, we didn't blow it up.
[01:04:01.105 --> 01:04:02.965]  Have you seen those videos of police saying, get back?
[01:04:03.645 --> 01:04:04.486]  No, I have not.
[01:04:04.986 --> 01:04:19.392]  I haven't seen those, but I did watch the actual film of Building 7 going down, and in my opinion, there's no doubt that that building was brought down with demolition, and when you look at how that building came down, it came down identical to the other two.
[01:04:21.173 --> 01:04:22.073]  Just incredible.
[01:04:22.634 --> 01:04:29.677]  When we come back, I want to talk about how we could investigate this, or where this should go, Governor, in your view, and then your take on the war.
[01:04:30.726 --> 01:04:31.647]  And that's basically it.
[01:04:32.007 --> 01:04:37.991]  Final segment with Governor Jesse Ventura, the new book, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me.
[01:04:38.031 --> 01:04:41.073]  I know some stations just joined us, but don't carry the first hour.
[01:04:41.113 --> 01:04:41.553]  Don't worry.
[01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:45.655]  In the days to come, we're going to re-air this interview in its entirety.
[01:04:45.996 --> 01:04:49.638]  We'll be right back with the final segment with Jesse, the mind Ventura.

[01:05:53.675 --> 01:05:57.098]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:05:57.278 --> 01:05:59.180]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:05:59.761 --> 01:06:02.523]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:06:02.824 --> 01:06:08.329]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:06:08.609 --> 01:06:12.553]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[01:06:52.386 --> 01:06:55.767]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:06:55.907 --> 01:07:01.129]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:06.091]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:07:06.471 --> 01:07:17.595]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.

[01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:56.545]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.228]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:03.111]  Well, we've got to have him back sometime in the near future.
[01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:05.013]  Just an amazing interview with
[01:08:06.192 --> 01:08:13.136]  Foreign Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, Hollywood movie star, wrestling champion, best-selling author, surfer.
[01:08:14.897 --> 01:08:17.278]  It's great getting to meet him in person when he was with Kinky Friedman.
[01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:24.922]  And we've had Willie Nelson called up a month or two ago and said, hey, I want to come on your show and talk about 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:08:24.962 --> 01:08:26.063]  And he came on and talked about it.
[01:08:27.074 --> 01:08:37.567]  Governor Ventura, what is the establishment going to do as one of the most respected living Italian presidents, former head of their intelligence, went public and said 9-11 was carried out by criminal elements of the government?
[01:08:38.888 --> 01:08:43.534]  What are people going to do as we see
[01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:51.463]  More and more and more and more former CIA section chiefs.
[01:08:52.463 --> 01:08:55.244]  We have just hundreds of engineers, physicists.
[01:08:56.404 --> 01:09:01.946]  We've got Bob Baird that the movie Siriana is about, a famous SEAL commander, saying all the evidence points at inside job.
[01:09:02.647 --> 01:09:04.407]  We have underwriting laboratories.
[01:09:04.767 --> 01:09:09.089]  Kevin Ryan, they did internal tests and said it was impossible with Building 7.
[01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:12.790]  What are they going to do as the laws of physics come out here?
[01:09:13.676 --> 01:09:16.382]  Well, they're going to continue to deny it.
[01:09:16.482 --> 01:09:19.789]  Your mainstream media is going to completely ignore anything.
[01:09:19.809 --> 01:09:24.740]  You know, the mainstream media has never shown the film of Building 7 going down.
[01:09:25.815 --> 01:09:34.699]  And what we have to do, in my opinion, is people like you and your radio show, and people like me, continue to tell people.
[01:09:34.759 --> 01:09:42.382]  Everywhere I go, I tell people to go to the internet and watch Loose Change, because my son turned me on to that.
[01:09:42.402 --> 01:09:47.205]  Of course, when he first told me, I thought, come on, they can put anything on the internet.
[01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:52.307]  When I finally did watch it, I went through every emotion you could imagine.
[01:09:53.207 --> 01:09:53.887]  We're good to go.
[01:10:13.294 --> 01:10:15.296]  And we don't want to lose our country.
[01:10:15.437 --> 01:10:17.379]  After all, it's still our country.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.684]  And until they put us down, we have the power.
[01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:27.954]  And we have the power to vote these people out of office and get people in there that have the best interests of the country in mind.
[01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.674]  Governor, I produced Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:31.875]  It just came out a few months ago.
[01:10:31.915 --> 01:10:32.595]  Have you seen that?
[01:10:32.635 --> 01:10:34.675]  I need to mail you a copy of it.
[01:10:35.275 --> 01:10:40.156]  No, I have not, but I'll tell you what, Alex, when I get back to the States, I got your phone number here.
[01:10:40.196 --> 01:10:42.217]  I'll give you a call and you can fire it up to me.
[01:10:42.777 --> 01:10:43.257]  Absolutely.
[01:10:43.437 --> 01:10:46.778]  And I will be back in May, so it isn't that far off.
[01:10:47.658 --> 01:10:48.398]  Fantastic.
[01:10:48.858 --> 01:10:50.658]  Now, I gave you a copy of Terror Storm.
[01:10:50.698 --> 01:10:51.899]  Did you have a chance to watch that?
[01:10:52.779 --> 01:10:53.819]  Review it for me quick.
[01:10:54.514 --> 01:10:55.915]  Remember when we met here in Texas?
[01:10:55.955 --> 01:10:56.535]  I gave you a copy.
[01:10:56.555 --> 01:10:56.675]  Sure.
[01:10:57.155 --> 01:10:59.277]  It's just the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:10:59.497 --> 01:11:00.217]  Okay, okay.
[01:11:00.277 --> 01:11:01.658]  I vaguely remember it, yeah.
[01:11:01.778 --> 01:11:05.460]  I've been reading so much and all that that, yeah, definitely know I do.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:11.263]  You told me that you read 16 books in the interim researching this and other subjects.
[01:11:11.343 --> 01:11:13.604]  What are other questions you have about the official story?
[01:11:14.244 --> 01:11:20.908]  Well, the other questions I have, again, are why was there no wreckage outside of the Pentagon?
[01:11:21.528 --> 01:11:33.372]  When the Pentagon was supposedly hit by this other plane, and in fact when I was watching Loose Change with a friend of mine, he happens to work for a company that helps to build the Boeing airplanes.
[01:11:33.992 --> 01:11:41.554]  And when they said that the engines completely disappeared and were destroyed, his response, excuse my French, was bullshit.
[01:11:43.715 --> 01:11:45.156]  And I turned to him and said, why?
[01:11:45.196 --> 01:11:47.676]  He said, because they're made out of titanium steel.
[01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.337]  They can't disintegrate.
[01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.894]  Well, they said that the whole plane disintegrated.
[01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:52.634]  Right.
[01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:56.377]  But the engines would never, because they're titanium steel.
[01:11:56.978 --> 01:11:57.298]  Whoa.
[01:11:58.259 --> 01:12:00.861]  I wonder why they're still keeping all the cameras secret, too.
[01:12:01.804 --> 01:12:04.506]  I don't know, well, but obviously why, Alex.
[01:12:04.606 --> 01:12:07.367]  They don't want any of us paying attention anymore.
[01:12:07.768 --> 01:12:09.128]  You don't remember something.
[01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:14.031]  Most people in the United States have an attention span of about, what, 30 minutes?
[01:12:14.151 --> 01:12:14.431]  Yes.
[01:12:15.112 --> 01:12:18.174]  And then they're on, and they don't pay attention after that.
[01:12:18.274 --> 01:12:27.399]  And the problem is, and I encourage people all the time, stop watching TV and start that old thing called reading.
[01:12:28.522 --> 01:12:34.003]  You know, start reading again, because it's the dumbing down of America that's happening right now.
[01:12:34.463 --> 01:12:43.965]  Case in point, last year, every major news station in America for 30 days covered the death lead story of Ann and Nicole Smith.
[01:12:44.045 --> 01:12:44.505]  They did.
[01:12:45.145 --> 01:12:51.866]  And I mean, I sat and got so angry because I thought, how does this woman warrant all of this?
[01:12:52.006 --> 01:12:53.386]  It's a distraction!
[01:12:53.747 --> 01:12:56.227]  She was a playboy playmate and a gold digger.
[01:12:56.767 --> 01:12:58.389]  Well, we have troops dying in Iraq.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:00.132]  We have the economy going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:13:00.673 --> 01:13:01.714]  We have all this corruption.
[01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:08.164]  In the five minutes we've got left with you, Governor, we are going to let you go because I know you're very busy and have a break before your next interview.
[01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.068]  I would like to get your take on
[01:13:12.009 --> 01:13:16.954]  Well, because always remember this, the most bastardly person in the world that I know of was Adolf Hitler.
[01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.667]  Well, let me put it to you another way.
[01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:40.408]  My mom and dad are both gone now.
[01:13:40.428 --> 01:13:45.030]  I've been an orphan since 1995, but my wife's parents are still alive and they're elderly people.
[01:13:59.878 --> 01:14:03.626]  And when I try to bring this up with them, they don't want to believe it.
[01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:06.251]  And the reason is so simple.
[01:14:06.431 --> 01:14:09.177]  They don't believe anyone can be that evil.
[01:14:10.365 --> 01:14:14.926]  And I think a great deal of people in this country are of that same thought.
[01:14:15.406 --> 01:14:18.187]  They don't believe that people can be that evil.
[01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:35.932]  And that's how Hitler was able to do what he did, because people judge the world according to themselves, and if they're nice, sweet people, then they think, and that's the main reason criminologists say women, you know, get in yellow Volkswagen's with Ted Bundy, because they can't believe a nice guy in a nice suit is going to be biting chunks out of them an hour later.
[01:14:36.392 --> 01:14:48.366]  Exactly, and that's the thing we have to wake up to, is that there are bad people, there are evil people, and when we sit back, then evil prevails if we allow it to happen.
[01:14:48.466 --> 01:14:52.931]  So we really have to, in many ways, blame ourselves for our own media today.
[01:14:53.852 --> 01:15:00.615]  We're following this National Enquirer media entertainment on TV instead of having them being hardline.
[01:15:00.635 --> 01:15:05.918]  You know, the downfall to the regular media actually was the show 60 Minutes.
[01:15:07.359 --> 01:15:14.102]  And what I mean by that is 60 Minutes was a great show, and they would do some great investigative reporting, but here was the downfall.
[01:15:14.602 --> 01:15:22.806]  Up until that point in time, the media wrote the news off as a business loss, that it was a required thing they had to do, but it didn't make money.
[01:15:23.306 --> 01:15:31.228]  When 60 Minutes came out, all of a sudden 60 Minutes was breaking into the top ten, and all of a sudden the light went off with the bean counters.
[01:15:31.248 --> 01:15:33.609]  You mean we could make money off the news?
[01:15:34.249 --> 01:15:35.689]  And there was your downfall.
[01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:40.211]  They got into creating the news instead of reporting it.
[01:15:40.611 --> 01:15:44.432]  Well, and then the CIA moved in big time to try to influence the media.
[01:15:44.812 --> 01:15:45.692]  That's been admitted.
[01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:51.734]  Getting back in the couple minutes we've got left with you, Governor, to 9-11, as a military man in your history,
[01:15:52.638 --> 01:16:03.527]  44,000 US troops, 18,000 British troops, two aircraft carrier attack groups in the three months before 9-11, massed in the countries and in the waters off of Afghanistan.
[01:16:03.587 --> 01:16:11.334]  Newsweek reported Bush, the day before 9-11, signed the attack orders to go into Afghanistan one week later.
[01:16:11.814 --> 01:16:13.335]  Isn't that pretty obvious?
[01:16:13.976 --> 01:16:18.139]  When you have all of these troops being massed and then Bush says, oh we went in because of 9-11?
[01:16:19.961 --> 01:16:24.206]  I can't answer that, Alex, because that's information I have no knowledge about.
[01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.229]  I have to just simply take your word for it.
[01:16:26.289 --> 01:16:29.073]  But if that is true, then absolutely, yes.
[01:16:29.253 --> 01:16:30.114]  Well, here's an example.
[01:16:30.134 --> 01:16:33.279]  You know about Gulf of Tonkin, because I talked to you a year and a half ago about that.
[01:16:33.319 --> 01:16:34.060]  They now admit
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:35.620]  That that was staged.
[01:16:36.081 --> 01:16:41.863]  They now admit, Chicago Tribune, that Israel did attack the Liberty in 1967 to try to blame it on Egypt.
[01:16:42.323 --> 01:16:43.523]  That's now declassified.
[01:16:43.723 --> 01:16:44.504]  That debate's over.
[01:16:44.784 --> 01:16:46.845]  I mean, governments, all governments have been caught.
[01:16:46.905 --> 01:16:50.286]  Putin's been caught doing things like this.
[01:16:50.546 --> 01:16:55.668]  Do we need to have a renaissance, an awakening to this, so criminal elements and governments stop doing it?
[01:16:55.688 --> 01:16:58.409]  I mean, how important is it to expose false flag terror?
[01:16:59.034 --> 01:17:01.237]  Well, that's why I wrote the book, Alex.
[01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:07.944]  It's Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, and I believe we must have a revolution in which to take our country back.
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:39.177]  uh... the book bound to be a bestseller don't start a revolution without me the war fifth-year anniversary was just a few weeks ago uh... the pentagon plans it will be there at least fifty years mccain says a hundred uh... cheney said hundred-year war uh... i mean how can we get the troops home when uh... they sell it in a way it's true that by putting the troops there erected so now we have to stay there to fix it but the study show we left it would get better i mean what would you do as president and
[01:17:40.215 --> 01:17:48.839]  You said on Larry King last night, so A, the war, and then B, you said that 80-something percent on Larry King Live in the poll wanted you to run for president.
[01:17:49.639 --> 01:17:52.280]  Are you thinking about running this year, or are you thinking about running in four years?
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:18:08.087]  Well, it's impossible for me to run this year unless somebody could get me ballot access in all 50 states, which is very, very difficult to do because the two-party system is set up so that there can't be any third entity that gets in there to give people an alternative choice.
[01:18:08.886 --> 01:18:12.487]  So, it's impossible for me to run at this late date, I would think.
[01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:17.129]  I mean, nothing's impossible, but it would be very slim to none to be able to do it.
[01:18:18.769 --> 01:18:24.691]  What we've got to do is, like I said, we've got to quit electing these people of the status quo.
[01:18:25.391 --> 01:18:37.815]  Whoever comes in next is going to face a... I don't envy it, because you're going to spend four years just cleaning up George Bush's mess, and I doubt you'd be able to do anything on your own at all until, you know, a second four years.
[01:18:37.895 --> 01:18:38.956]  No, no, no, that makes sense.
[01:18:39.176 --> 01:18:50.082]  But you're in shape, you're jogging, you told me, every day, and you're surfing, and so hopefully you can get geared up and in four years, perfect time for Jesse Ventura to run for president, maybe with Ron Paul on the ticket.
[01:18:50.562 --> 01:18:53.724]  Well, that remains, you know, you never say never, Alex.
[01:18:53.804 --> 01:18:57.506]  I've learned that in 56 years on the planet, that you never say never.
[01:18:58.266 --> 01:19:08.333]  Who knows what could happen, but then on the flip side, you know, I might be down there riding giants with, what's his name, the Big Surfer.
[01:19:09.894 --> 01:19:12.095]  Shoot, I can't think of his name now off the top of my head.
[01:19:28.446 --> 01:19:30.768]  Oh, thank you, Alex, and keep up the great work.
[01:19:30.848 --> 01:19:38.433]  And, you know, between all of us, we can make the United States the great country it used to be, and it can rise up and be that again.
[01:19:38.813 --> 01:19:40.434]  Hey, listen, it's your song!
[01:19:40.754 --> 01:19:43.056]  Get back to Mexico, do some surfing for me, Governor.
[01:19:43.456 --> 01:19:44.497]  I sure will, Alex.
[01:19:44.577 --> 01:19:45.657]  Take care and good luck.
[01:19:45.938 --> 01:19:47.519]  There goes Jesse the Mind Ventura.
[01:19:47.779 --> 01:19:48.519]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:53.442]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.544]  A new world order.
[01:19:56.264 --> 01:19:57.185]  In the near future.
[01:19:58.081 --> 01:20:00.702]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:20:01.123 --> 01:20:03.284]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:03.964 --> 01:20:06.205]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[01:20:06.745 --> 01:20:09.207]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:09.947 --> 01:20:17.251]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:20.285 --> 01:20:25.248]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:29.131]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[01:22:51.932 --> 01:22:57.658]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[01:22:58.018 --> 01:23:03.624]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[01:23:03.965 --> 01:23:07.809]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[01:23:08.109 --> 01:23:13.014]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:21.421]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:07.853]  Here's a little clip in this segment and the next.
[01:24:07.873 --> 01:24:11.256]  It's like an hour long, the whole thing's on the web.
[01:24:11.276 --> 01:24:29.391]  From a BBC documentary where they just proved, what we already knew, that three CIA operatives at least, several others, well-known ones, Frank Morales and others, at the Ambassador Hotel 40 years ago, killing Bobby Kennedy.
[01:24:30.908 --> 01:24:33.772]  So we're going to play that while I take a little break and eat some lunch.
[01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:36.255]  Let's just get honest here.
[01:24:36.616 --> 01:24:37.497]  But it's really good.
[01:24:37.517 --> 01:24:41.262]  Then we're going to come back and take calls and cover news, balance of the show.
[01:24:41.762 --> 01:24:43.304]  I'll be sitting here with you folks listening.
[01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:43.665]  Here it is.
[01:24:45.256 --> 01:24:53.026]  Well, had he lived, Bobby Kennedy would have been 81 today, instead of which he was killed in one of the most famous political assassinations of modern American history.
[01:24:53.266 --> 01:24:57.852]  A Palestinian man, Sirhan Sirhan, was seized, charged, tried, and convicted.
[01:24:57.912 --> 01:25:01.677]  Nearly 40 years on, he's still in jail, repeatedly denied parole.
[01:25:02.429 --> 01:25:10.091]  The violent deaths of prominent people, whether they be Bobby Kennedy's brother, JFK, or even Diana, Princess of Wales, routinely attract conspiracy theories.
[01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:15.332]  But that wasn't uppermost in the mind of Shane O'Sullivan when he began to look into the assassination.
[01:25:15.912 --> 01:25:17.573]  There's some strong language in his film.
[01:25:19.453 --> 01:25:29.416]  One thing is clear in this year of 1968, I believe in this country as I travelled across, and that is that the American people want no more Vietnam.
[01:25:35.968 --> 01:25:42.273]  In August in Chicago, the Democratic Party will nominate its candidate for President of the United States.
[01:25:43.494 --> 01:25:45.296]  There are two roads to that nomination.
[01:25:46.116 --> 01:25:48.899]  One is to seek commitment through discussions with political leaders.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:54.363]  The other is to go to the people.
[01:25:56.505 --> 01:25:58.086]  June 5th, 1968.
[01:25:58.366 --> 01:26:00.028]  The Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles.
[01:26:00.648 --> 01:26:05.332]  Bobby Kennedy wins the California Democratic Primary and is tipped to beat Nixon to the White House.
[01:26:06.343 --> 01:26:27.431]  I think it's quite clear is that we can work together in the last analysis and that what has been going on within the United States over the period of the last three years, the divisions, the violence, the disenchantment with our society, the divisions whether it's between blacks and whites, between the poor and the more affluent, or between age groups, or on the war in Vietnam,
[01:26:27.864 --> 01:26:29.325]  That we can start to work together.
[01:26:29.345 --> 01:26:33.086]  We are a great country, and a selfish country, and a compassionate country.
[01:26:33.446 --> 01:26:43.290]  And I intend to make that my basis for running, and over the period of... Mayor Yorty has just sent me a message that we've been here too long already.
[01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:51.493]  So, uh... My thanks to all of you, and now it's on to Chicago, and let's win there.
[01:26:52.754 --> 01:26:55.935]  Moments later, he is assassinated while leaving through a kitchen pantry.
[01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:05.851]  Oh my God.
[01:27:06.331 --> 01:27:16.574]  Senator Kennedy has been shot in the head.
[01:27:18.054 --> 01:27:20.835]  It's only two months since the assassination of Martin Luther King.
[01:27:30.572 --> 01:27:35.834]  24-year-old Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan is seen firing at Kennedy and is arrested as the lone assassin.
[01:27:36.614 --> 01:27:40.816]  But for nearly 40 years, debate has raged over whether a second gunman was involved.
[01:27:41.716 --> 01:27:49.319]  Police diagrams based on the autopsy show the fatal shot came from behind, but witnesses place Sirhan's gun several feet in front of Kennedy.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.742]  The actual shooter of Robert Kennedy was standing behind Robert Kennedy, according to the autopsy report.
[01:27:56.862 --> 01:27:59.043]  Sirhan was standing in front of him, face to face.
[01:27:59.787 --> 01:28:07.331]  The distance between the muzzle of the assailant's weapon and Robert Kennedy's body was somewhere between actual contact and no more than three inches.
[01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:13.454]  And the weapon from which the shots were fired was held at a sharp upward angle, again from the rear.
[01:28:14.154 --> 01:28:21.778]  All the witnesses state Sirhan's weapon was held between one and a half and six feet away from Robert Kennedy, horizontally, in relation to the floor.
[01:28:22.218 --> 01:28:23.859]  The autopsy report exonerates Sirhan.
[01:28:24.466 --> 01:28:28.149]  Behind me is the famous Ambassador Hotel where Robert Kennedy was assassinated that night.
[01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:32.273]  It's now a construction site, shortly to be a high school project in memory of Bobby Kennedy.
[01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:37.918]  I started running a screenplay three years ago based on this case, fascinated by the conspiracy theories.
[01:28:38.378 --> 01:28:46.706]  During the course of my research, I found new video and photographs that suggested three CIA operatives were at the hotel that night, and I believe involved in the assassination.
[01:28:48.152 --> 01:28:54.534]  Agent number 1, the Indian man in the white shirt at the back of the room, moments after the speech and just before the shooting.
[01:28:55.035 --> 01:28:56.815]  I think this man is David Morales.
[01:28:58.396 --> 01:29:10.320]  Moments after the shooting, agent number 2, Gordon Campbell, walks from the direction of the pantry with a small container in his hand, as a Latin man waves him towards an exit.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:14.242]  30 minutes after the shooting, here is agent 1 again, David Morales.
[01:29:15.797 --> 01:29:19.161]  I also found several photographs of these agents earlier in the evening.
[01:29:20.103 --> 01:29:26.190]  Here, Agent 2, Gordon Campbell, stands in the ballroom hours before the shooting, with a third agent.
[01:29:27.172 --> 01:29:33.600]  These officers worked together in 1963 at JM Wave, the CIA's Miami base for its secret war on Castro.
[01:29:42.216 --> 01:29:45.180]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.825]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.481]  America needs Ron Paul.
[01:29:53.701 --> 01:29:54.762]  He needs your support.
[01:29:54.982 --> 01:29:55.983]  The time is now.
[01:29:56.364 --> 01:30:00.247]  As long as he has your support, he will continue to fight until the very end.
[01:30:00.587 --> 01:30:04.670]  We know that many people would like to show their support, but want to do it on a larger scale.
[01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:10.955]  RonPaulFlags.com produces the most beautiful flags dedicated to electing the only man fit to be president.

[01:31:51.946 --> 01:31:57.590]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[01:31:57.790 --> 01:32:02.934]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[01:32:03.214 --> 01:32:08.298]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[01:32:08.598 --> 01:32:12.161]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[01:32:12.501 --> 01:32:12.781]  I think so.
[01:32:39.432 --> 01:32:41.834]  Up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[01:32:52.602 --> 01:33:01.409]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[01:33:14.348 --> 01:33:18.070]  Talk about news-making headlines.
[01:33:19.211 --> 01:33:27.277]  Jesse Ventura believes Barack Obama is in danger of assassination if he gets the nomination.
[01:33:28.418 --> 01:33:29.538]  Because he's anti-war.
[01:33:29.999 --> 01:33:31.900]  Just like JFK and Bobby Kennedy.
[01:33:33.081 --> 01:33:36.623]  Headline, Jesse Ventura says his book was censored by 20-plus publishers.
[01:33:38.184 --> 01:33:38.825]  That's breaking.
[01:33:40.405 --> 01:33:44.446]  It's not even in the book about MSNBC censoring him.
[01:33:44.846 --> 01:33:45.286]  Breaking.
[01:33:46.147 --> 01:33:49.367]  Coming right out and saying he kicks himself at 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:33:50.108 --> 01:33:52.368]  Just boom, boom, boom, baby!
[01:33:52.388 --> 01:33:56.889]  And let me tell you, we got even bigger guests lined up later this month.
[01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:00.650]  I love giving it to the New World Order.
[01:34:02.311 --> 01:34:03.891]  Most people in our government are good.
[01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:05.112]  They're compartmentalized.
[01:34:05.492 --> 01:34:06.572]  They don't know what they're doing.
[01:34:07.276 --> 01:34:11.859]  And if we can just wake them up and wake the people up in corporate America, we can turn this around.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:27.249]  And as more people go public, as Actress of the Year, Best Actress Oscar, and as Presidents, and Members of Parliament, and Japanese Parliament, and European Parliament go public, it is gaining exponential energy.
[01:34:27.609 --> 01:34:33.033]  We're going to take calls, and I've got a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet as well, but I'm going to wait until the last 30 minutes.
[01:34:33.053 --> 01:34:33.553]  The next 45-50 minutes,
[01:34:35.583 --> 01:34:50.210]  The rest of this hour, into the next hour, it is going to be all your phone calls on any subjects you'd like to discuss at 1-800-259-9231 on this Wednesday, April 2nd, 2008 edition.
[01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:50.750]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:53.331]  And here's how it works.
[01:34:53.892 --> 01:34:55.372]  First time callers go to the head of the line.
[01:34:56.513 --> 01:34:59.754]  You are only trumped by people that disagree.
[01:35:02.436 --> 01:35:04.817]  And I don't do that every day where you get trumped by
[01:35:06.374 --> 01:35:07.914]  First-time callers.
[01:35:08.254 --> 01:35:09.295]  We do that about once a week.
[01:35:09.735 --> 01:35:12.175]  But every day, if you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[01:35:16.896 --> 01:35:18.397]  Other than that, there's no call screening.
[01:35:18.437 --> 01:35:22.158]  In fact, if you want to call up and say you're calling from the moon and your name's Mud, we don't care.
[01:35:22.198 --> 01:35:24.798]  If you volunteer you disagree, head of the line.
[01:35:25.699 --> 01:35:30.060]  Our enemies still lie on the web and say that we screen calls and that it's fake callers.
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.540]  That's because they're enemies of the Republic.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:36.081]  All you've got to do is call in right now and find out the truth for yourself.
[01:35:36.442 --> 01:35:36.862]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:37.082 --> 01:35:47.685]  Let's finish up with a little piece of this Bobby Kennedy film, BBC, and then we'll go right to your phone calls.
[01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:52.826]  This definitely, from the profile, is hugely similar.
[01:35:52.846 --> 01:35:53.506]  The body language
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.202]  Is very, very much characteristic of Morales.
[01:36:14.525 --> 01:36:19.169]  See how he moves back and forth very casually, does not attract attention to himself?
[01:36:22.471 --> 01:36:26.313]  That, that is no question.
[01:36:28.735 --> 01:36:31.857]  Bradley also recognized his former case officer, Gordon Campbell.
[01:36:34.258 --> 01:36:35.859]  Yeah, that's excellent.
[01:36:39.281 --> 01:36:43.603]  I could certainly verify 90% ID of Gordon Campbell.
[01:36:44.043 --> 01:36:47.345]  And less a little hair, as I remember him.
[01:36:48.886 --> 01:36:51.548]  The facial features are certainly his.
[01:36:52.468 --> 01:36:52.968]  Absolutely.
[01:36:53.729 --> 01:36:55.029]  Obviously, the two of them are together.
[01:36:55.730 --> 01:37:00.733]  They're looking for a way out because this fellow is guiding him, showing him an exit.
[01:37:01.533 --> 01:37:03.034]  Obviously, he's got something in his hand.
[01:37:04.108 --> 01:37:07.130]  I think it's impossible to determine what it is.
[01:37:08.491 --> 01:37:14.936]  These men are alleged to have hated the Kennedys for withdrawing air support for the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.
[01:37:15.776 --> 01:37:20.239]  And Morales admitted to his ex-lawyer that he was involved in both Kennedy assassinations.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:32.548]  Well, something like, uh... I was in Dallas, uh, when my, uh... When we got that... And I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard.
[01:37:33.112 --> 01:37:43.877]  What it said to me was that he was in some way implicated with the death of John Kennedy.
[01:37:45.037 --> 01:37:48.539]  And let's go one step further, and also Bobby.
[01:37:49.979 --> 01:37:54.521]  An interesting claim from a friend of Morales, but until now there's been no photographic evidence.
[01:37:55.561 --> 01:37:59.223]  I traveled to Washington to meet Wayne Smith, who worked with Morales at the U.S.
[01:37:59.283 --> 01:38:00.403]  Embassy in Havana in 1959.
[01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:04.611]  This photograph of Morales dates from the same time.
[01:38:05.292 --> 01:38:07.493]  Would Smith recognize Morales in the video?
[01:38:07.513 --> 01:38:08.653]  David Morales.
[01:38:09.394 --> 01:38:11.335]  That's him.
[01:38:11.955 --> 01:38:12.995]  That's Dave Morales.
[01:38:13.816 --> 01:38:14.136]  Really?
[01:38:20.759 --> 01:38:22.980]  Yeah, I'm virtually certain.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.921]  Is there anything... No, it's him again.
[01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:25.762]  It's him again.
[01:38:25.962 --> 01:38:27.883]  Yeah, we've seen him a few times.
[01:38:31.784 --> 01:38:33.424]  That's Morales.
[01:38:33.764 --> 01:38:34.644]  That's Morales.
[01:38:36.445 --> 01:38:38.245]  Yeah, I knew Morales quite well.
[01:38:38.265 --> 01:38:45.047]  He worked in the CIA station in Havana when I was third secretary of the political section.
[01:38:46.167 --> 01:38:52.969]  And I got to know him fairly well and saw him again a number of times.
[01:38:53.069 --> 01:38:56.990]  He came to Buenos Aires when I was political counselor down there.
[01:38:57.765 --> 01:39:00.847]  And we had dinner at a friend's house one evening.
[01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:06.551]  So, yeah, I have no hesitation in saying that's where we're at.
[01:39:09.493 --> 01:39:13.336]  All right, we're going to be taking your calls here in just a second.
[01:39:15.478 --> 01:39:21.922]  By the way, I know we're getting a lot of emails and the message boards and people saying, oh, man, I didn't know you had Jesse Ventura coming on.
[01:39:23.263 --> 01:39:24.964]  But it wasn't just an interview with Jesse Ventura.
[01:39:25.004 --> 01:39:27.266]  They always spill their guts on this show.
[01:39:28.655 --> 01:39:30.556]  It's the fact of what they say on this show.
[01:39:31.877 --> 01:39:41.964]  And we even have video plugged into the board, because we videotaped myself in here live, and then we put images to it and put it up for PrisonPlanet.tv members, put a shorter version up on YouTube for everybody.
[01:39:44.505 --> 01:39:56.433]  And so I'm talking to the interior during the break, we're going to put some of this on the web, and uh... I wasn't even going to bring 9-11 up, because I'd already done a 9-11 interview with him,
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.543]  And off record, he'd said more, on record, he was kind of irritated by it.
[01:40:01.743 --> 01:40:05.526]  He told me, I want to do more research, yeah, I've read some stuff, and I'm going to look into this.
[01:40:05.946 --> 01:40:06.487]  And he did.
[01:40:08.208 --> 01:40:10.330]  That was about a year and a half ago, so I wasn't going to bring 9-11 up.
[01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:14.153]  And then I went and talked to him during a break, and I'm like, hey, let's talk about the war when we get back.
[01:40:14.193 --> 01:40:15.694]  He goes, hey, I want to get into 9-11.
[01:40:16.895 --> 01:40:17.775]  But let's talk about it.
[01:40:17.815 --> 01:40:19.116]  I wasn't ready, but now I am.
[01:40:21.018 --> 01:40:22.299]  And then he came and repeated that on air.
[01:40:25.135 --> 01:40:26.956]  I mean, major breaking news.
[01:40:27.036 --> 01:40:28.276]  So, it was in the first hour.
[01:40:28.376 --> 01:40:29.176]  I give you hints.
[01:40:30.877 --> 01:40:32.757]  See, there are powers that be behind the scenes.
[01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:34.378]  There are people that put pressure on folks.
[01:40:34.818 --> 01:40:37.438]  That's why we never tell you when we're having a big guest on.
[01:40:38.138 --> 01:40:51.162]  If it's Charlie Sheen, or Charlton Heston, or Mayor Ed Koch, or a member of British Parliament, or Willie Nelson, or Muse,
[01:40:55.233 --> 01:40:58.334]  That's some big rock bands we're going to be having on soon, by the way, working on that right now.
[01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:02.435]  We never tell you, because it's a surprise!
[01:41:03.355 --> 01:41:04.816]  But I do give you a heads up.
[01:41:04.896 --> 01:41:08.277]  I say, hey, tomorrow, early in the show, first hour, be tuned in.
[01:41:08.297 --> 01:41:09.657]  A lot of people weren't.
[01:41:10.137 --> 01:41:19.179]  Don't worry, when the show ends, in an hour and 20 minutes, he was on the first minute of the show.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.000]  For an hour and 20 minutes.
[01:41:21.824 --> 01:41:24.188]  And it was bombshell after bombshell.
[01:41:24.809 --> 01:41:27.774]  The interview is nowhere but on the internet, and it's not even on the web yet.
[01:41:27.794 --> 01:41:32.122]  It just happened at 2 o'clock Central, 3 o'clock Eastern.
[01:41:32.863 --> 01:41:35.327]  I mean, noon Pacific.
[01:41:37.699 --> 01:41:42.761]  We will re-air the Jesse Ventura interview in its entirety at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:42.781 --> 01:41:46.683]  And I know AM and FM stations around the country also rebroadcast this at night or in the morning.
[01:41:46.703 --> 01:41:47.864]  She'll also be able to hear it there.
[01:41:47.904 --> 01:41:49.764]  Very thankful to those affiliates.
[01:41:49.784 --> 01:41:51.825]  But she'll be able to hear Jesse Ventura.
[01:41:52.146 --> 01:41:53.286]  And it's a big interview.
[01:41:53.546 --> 01:41:55.307]  We can wake up a lot of people with this.
[01:41:55.627 --> 01:41:56.868]  He's got a lot of courage.
[01:41:57.868 --> 01:42:01.930]  We need to use this now to wake people up.
[01:42:04.341 --> 01:42:05.382]  The ball is in your court.
[01:42:05.422 --> 01:42:06.682]  We got the big guest for you.
[01:42:06.963 --> 01:42:08.944]  He said the powerful things on this show.
[01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:16.248]  The articles are going to be up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com in the next two hours.
[01:42:16.708 --> 01:42:24.513]  I've got writers Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson and Steve Watson working on it feverishly from Sheffield, London and New Mexico.
[01:42:25.754 --> 01:42:32.638]  So from England and the US, from the southwestern mountains of the lower
[01:42:33.576 --> 01:42:34.116]  Rockies.
[01:42:35.777 --> 01:42:41.238]  To the stomping grounds of Robin Hood.
[01:42:42.679 --> 01:42:45.220]  To the gallows where Captain Kidd was hung.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.900]  We bring you the information.
[01:42:48.661 --> 01:42:50.241]  I'm out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:51.642 --> 01:42:59.224]  But I get endorphins when we get a big guest and they talk about powerful things, important things, when we hurt the New World Order.
[01:42:59.464 --> 01:43:01.885]  We bring them one step closer to the gallows.
[01:43:04.048 --> 01:43:07.331]  I, uh, I start having intense feelings of pleasure.
[01:43:07.371 --> 01:43:07.771]  Hold on.
[01:43:08.132 --> 01:43:08.612]  Ah, yes.
[01:43:09.032 --> 01:43:12.075]  Ah.
[01:43:12.255 --> 01:43:12.815]  Ah.
[01:43:13.696 --> 01:43:17.639]  I don't need any drugs to take a ride, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:20.121 --> 01:43:23.784]  I'm high as a kite right now, because believe me, this story's gonna be big.
[01:43:25.346 --> 01:43:26.447]  And it's gonna have an effect.
[01:43:27.928 --> 01:43:32.692]  And it's one more step towards the throats of the New World Order and bringing them to justice.
[01:43:34.108 --> 01:43:36.570]  And I see more and more people standing up and showing courage.
[01:43:37.731 --> 01:43:38.112]  It is.
[01:43:38.132 --> 01:43:39.853]  The dam broke a long time ago.
[01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:43.176]  And now the floodgates are opening.
[01:43:44.738 --> 01:43:47.900]  And if you can't celebrate major victories, I don't know what's wrong with you.
[01:43:50.102 --> 01:43:50.923]  It's like Ron Paul.
[01:43:52.625 --> 01:43:56.008]  People think because he's not winning the presidency, but he's staying in the race,
[01:43:56.767 --> 01:43:57.487]  That we've lost.
[01:43:57.587 --> 01:43:59.528]  No, we won when we stood up and fought.
[01:44:00.048 --> 01:44:04.310]  We won when we made the international bankers and the currency tax, the inflation tax.
[01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:07.371]  The open border is a big issue.
[01:44:07.471 --> 01:44:08.931]  When we exposed the New World Order.
[01:44:10.252 --> 01:44:15.034]  When Ron Paul stood up and showed that we're five years into a war and that all the other candidates are basically pushing it.
[01:44:16.314 --> 01:44:18.675]  And we grew tens of millions of people.
[01:44:19.355 --> 01:44:20.396]  We grew our movement.
[01:44:20.456 --> 01:44:21.296]  They came in.
[01:44:21.356 --> 01:44:22.056]  They woke up.
[01:44:22.096 --> 01:44:24.317]  Now they're finding out more hardcore info.
[01:44:26.556 --> 01:44:31.818]  I mean, Al Gore is trying to hire 10 million cronies.
[01:44:36.519 --> 01:44:42.281]  By the way, quote, quote, liberal, foundation liberal, Carnegie, Rockefeller endowment, nothing liberal about them.
[01:44:43.082 --> 01:44:47.283]  They're always saying they want to recreate the communist youth brigades of Lenin and Mao.
[01:44:48.007 --> 01:44:54.191]  The Communist Youth Brigade, the little red books in the Cultural Revolution, killed, and helped kill, the 60 million people.
[01:44:54.751 --> 01:45:02.876]  Nothing like out-of-control, power-tripping, 16- to 20-year-olds coming in your house, destroying your art, raping your wife, shooting you in the back of the head.
[01:45:03.176 --> 01:45:07.619]  I'm not putting up with it, Gore, and that's exactly what these 10 million scumbags are.
[01:45:07.639 --> 01:45:16.725]  A bunch of well-meaning, patchouli oil-wearing, dreadlocks, sandal, uh, you know, rich white kids,
[01:45:17.495 --> 01:45:19.396]  Who hate Daddy because he's a Republican.
[01:45:19.716 --> 01:45:21.076]  They own the Democrats, too!
[01:45:21.576 --> 01:45:27.218]  They've got terror on the right to get our liberties, and they've got the fake greenhouse crises on the left.
[01:45:27.818 --> 01:45:36.441]  You want to worry about something, worry about fission fusion and nuclear reactors and particle accelerators, cyclotrons, heavy reactors.
[01:45:36.901 --> 01:45:40.562]  Start worrying about antimatter bombs, which they admit they've created.
[01:45:41.281 --> 01:45:43.182]  Start worrying about genetic engineering.
[01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:46.004]  Start worrying about pesticides, like Roundup.
[01:45:46.565 --> 01:45:54.610]  Start worrying about things that are actually killing us, and killing this planet, instead of running around talking about carbon dioxide, which has been 14 times higher in our history!
[01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:54.850]  We need it!
[01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:55.571]  We need more of it, you idiots!
[01:45:55.591 --> 01:45:57.412]  It's the life gas, you stupid twit!
[01:45:57.432 --> 01:45:58.072]  Excuse me, excuse me.
[01:45:58.092 --> 01:46:09.280]  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[01:46:13.158 --> 01:46:14.179]  Stop being conned!
[01:46:14.279 --> 01:46:15.300]  Stop being suckered!
[01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:16.681]  Stop being taken!
[01:46:17.022 --> 01:46:18.323]  Stop being manipulated!
[01:46:21.486 --> 01:46:24.509]  You know, I'm endangering my life doing this, and I'm reckless, everybody knows it.
[01:46:25.710 --> 01:46:30.234]  And I'm committed to this, and that's why it feels so good when we have victory after victory.
[01:46:30.274 --> 01:46:33.077]  I'm just running for as many yards as I can get, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:35.382 --> 01:46:42.627]  And I'm asking you to get out there on the field and just to commit and go 110% in this fight!
[01:46:42.987 --> 01:46:44.448]  This isn't a football game!
[01:46:44.468 --> 01:46:45.749]  This is for your life!
[01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:47.971]  This is for your children's future!
[01:46:48.151 --> 01:46:49.412]  This is for everything!
[01:46:49.692 --> 01:46:50.373]  On the line!
[01:46:50.633 --> 01:46:51.253]  Now!
[01:46:55.256 --> 01:46:57.017]  This is what humanity's all about.
[01:46:57.037 --> 01:46:58.618]  The struggle for liberty and freedom.
[01:46:58.939 --> 01:47:00.520]  Can't you feel it in your bones?
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.081]  Can't you feel it in your heart?
[01:47:06.883 --> 01:47:08.843]  It feels good to know what's happening.
[01:47:08.863 --> 01:47:12.804]  It feels good to be committed to justice and liberty and freedom and to serve the species.
[01:47:13.584 --> 01:47:17.045]  Don't you know that when you serve the species, you end up serving yourself?
[01:47:17.585 --> 01:47:21.206]  You reap what you sow, you give, and you receive.
[01:47:22.586 --> 01:47:27.767]  That's the secret of the universe, not what the worldly servants of the devil sell you.
[01:47:28.187 --> 01:47:31.268]  Screw everybody, cheat everybody, stab everybody in the back.
[01:47:32.324 --> 01:47:38.811]  But that doesn't mean, as Christians or people that just love liberty and freedom, that we're a bunch of limp-wristed cowards.
[01:47:39.892 --> 01:47:45.918]  It doesn't mean when somebody cheats us or stabs us or is wicked and tries to bring us down that we don't kick them to the curb.
[01:47:46.919 --> 01:47:53.645]  It means when somebody who's well-meaning but stupid does something, or someone who isn't pure evil does something, you forgive them.
[01:47:53.886 --> 01:47:55.307]  Or if it's your family, you forgive them.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:58.981]  But you do not forgive the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:59.001 --> 01:48:01.521]  You realize who they are, and you keep them out of your life.
[01:48:01.561 --> 01:48:02.521]  You ostracize them.
[01:48:04.722 --> 01:48:05.202]  Try that.
[01:48:05.262 --> 01:48:07.662]  People make fun of you and laugh at you at work or church, whatever.
[01:48:07.842 --> 01:48:09.063]  Just stop talking to them.
[01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:12.383]  Stop caring what cowardly scum thinks.
[01:48:12.863 --> 01:48:15.004]  Stop caring what weak-minded people think.
[01:48:15.504 --> 01:48:18.325]  You've got strong minds, stronger than most people.
[01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:21.945]  That's why you listen to this show, and you know what Veritas is.
[01:48:22.665 --> 01:48:25.106]  Truth is flowing through your very veins.
[01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:32.011]  Okay.
[01:48:32.391 --> 01:48:33.252]  I gotta get settled down.
[01:48:34.053 --> 01:48:35.795]  Thought I felt like I could take on 20 people right now.
[01:48:37.558 --> 01:48:37.798]  Man!
[01:48:40.001 --> 01:48:41.243]  Because I'm not doing this for nothing.
[01:48:41.263 --> 01:48:42.885]  I'm not playing this game to lose!
[01:48:46.950 --> 01:48:48.112]  I just gotta turn loose.
[01:48:48.212 --> 01:48:48.733]  That's the key.
[01:48:50.330 --> 01:48:50.950]  Turn loose.
[01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:53.791]  Stop caring what your cowardly neighbors think.
[01:48:54.191 --> 01:48:55.111]  Stop caring.
[01:48:55.171 --> 01:49:01.032]  Stop cowering to some cop when he tells you to turn your camera off when you're 50 yards away filming an arrest.
[01:49:01.432 --> 01:49:02.612]  You tell him it's my First Amendment.
[01:49:02.872 --> 01:49:03.952]  Stop being afraid.
[01:49:03.972 --> 01:49:07.873]  If you're a good officer, stop being afraid.
[01:49:07.953 --> 01:49:08.513]  Speak up.
[01:49:10.173 --> 01:49:11.814]  I know there's good ones, a lot of them out there.
[01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:19.015]  You know, I'm always bashing cops because it's a sick culture and the bad ones really stand out and make the rest of the good ones look bad.
[01:49:20.692 --> 01:49:21.773]  But I look at the statistics.
[01:49:21.793 --> 01:49:25.656]  They have had national polls of police where 98% are pro-Second Amendment.
[01:49:27.718 --> 01:49:32.621]  Ron Paul got almost 80% of all the military donations to the Republicans.
[01:49:33.182 --> 01:49:34.102]  So the military's good.
[01:49:34.523 --> 01:49:35.303]  The cops are good.
[01:49:36.044 --> 01:49:39.006]  I get threatened by police at a primitive level because I know my nose is clean.
[01:49:39.246 --> 01:49:40.307]  I know I'm a good person.
[01:49:42.069 --> 01:49:44.510]  I know I'm not doing anything wrong other than speeding.
[01:49:45.611 --> 01:49:47.573]  And I know I don't deserve to be treated like dirt!
[01:49:50.225 --> 01:49:57.268]  But I just want the police to know that I am your friend at my core, and I'm just sick of you being conned, just like I'm sick of everybody else being conned.
[01:49:57.688 --> 01:49:58.728]  It's disgusting!
[01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:08.572]  It's like watching your son get in the car with a bunch of drug addicts, and you know he's going off to use drugs.
[01:50:09.052 --> 01:50:09.972]  Well, you shouldn't be a wimp.
[01:50:09.992 --> 01:50:11.953]  You should grab him out of that car and not let him go.
[01:50:12.737 --> 01:50:15.458]  I'm not saying I see the police as my son, but you understand.
[01:50:15.998 --> 01:50:17.138]  I see you as being conned.
[01:50:17.218 --> 01:50:18.379]  Somebody I actually care about.
[01:50:18.759 --> 01:50:22.540]  Being manipulated by people that don't give a rat's butt about you!
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.701]  Alright, I said I'd take calls.
[01:50:24.721 --> 01:50:25.161]  We're gonna do it.
[01:50:25.441 --> 01:50:31.603]  By the way, next Monday, big announcement about the course and future of something
[01:50:32.401 --> 01:50:33.082]  Very important.

[01:50:52.119 --> 01:51:04.855]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:05.276 --> 01:51:09.101]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:51:09.441 --> 01:51:15.944]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:16.324 --> 01:51:19.505]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:19.745 --> 01:51:27.248]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:58.630]  I was a highway man.
[01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:01.871]  Along the coach roads I did ride.
[01:54:02.451 --> 01:54:06.093]  With sword and pistol by my side.
[01:54:07.671 --> 01:54:30.908]  Many a young maid Many a soldier Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five But I am still alive Alright, we're going to go to France because it's a foreign call.
[01:54:30.928 --> 01:54:34.350]  But first, Wesleyan, Idaho disagrees.
[01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:35.471]  You're first up.
[01:54:36.255 --> 01:54:36.715]  Welcome.
[01:54:37.155 --> 01:54:38.156]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:38.636 --> 01:54:39.076]  Welcome.
[01:54:39.616 --> 01:54:41.117]  Music off now?
[01:54:41.737 --> 01:54:45.658]  Ah, I feel the endorphins as well.
[01:54:46.418 --> 01:54:50.599]  A great interview with Jesse the Mind Ventura.
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:55:03.303]  It's great to hear someone of his prominence speaking about 9-1-1, but I do take huge exception with you and Jesse.
[01:55:03.323 --> 01:55:04.744]  I hope you're out there listening.
[01:55:04.804 --> 01:55:05.164]  You can
[01:55:05.894 --> 01:55:14.420]  Read my letter in the Idaho Observer this month, page 21, or you can just simply... Okay, you said... Hold on.
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:15.501]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[01:55:15.741 --> 01:55:16.342]  Put them on hold.
[01:55:16.362 --> 01:55:16.802]  Put them on hold.
[01:55:16.822 --> 01:55:19.304]  Okay, we went right to you.
[01:55:19.324 --> 01:55:21.425]  You made some comment about the music, the rest of it.
[01:55:23.307 --> 01:55:23.967]  You want to be arrogant?
[01:55:23.987 --> 01:55:24.588]  I'm going to be arrogant.
[01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:26.869]  You got the floor, buddy.
[01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:28.010]  Disagree with me.
[01:55:28.451 --> 01:55:30.132]  Get to the meat of the matter right now.
[01:55:30.192 --> 01:55:30.572]  Go ahead.
[01:55:31.093 --> 01:55:31.593]  Right now?
[01:55:31.833 --> 01:55:32.954]  Okay, you can Google
[01:55:33.621 --> 01:55:44.193]  Big lie, Hitler, and go to Wikipedia and find that Hitler did not say, the bigger the lie, the easier the sell.
[01:55:44.494 --> 01:55:46.996]  Put him on hold, put him on hold, I'm going to say what he really said.
[01:55:47.417 --> 01:55:54.125]  Joseph Goebbels wrote that the Soviets were liars, that the Communists were liars, and that they
[01:55:55.151 --> 01:55:55.451]  Am I back on?
[01:55:55.531 --> 01:55:57.051]  He accused the Jews of using the big lie
[01:56:16.829 --> 01:56:17.329]  technique.
[01:56:17.630 --> 01:56:29.957]  Go also, on the internet, is Goebbels' 1934 Nuremberg Rally speech, and the words in that speech are words to live by.
[01:56:30.097 --> 01:56:32.758]  They are fantastic!
[01:56:33.138 --> 01:56:34.599]  Okay, listen, thanks for the call, man.
[01:56:34.639 --> 01:56:35.680]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:56:39.042 --> 01:56:41.123]  Yeah, Goebbels constantly talked about the big lie.
[01:56:41.864 --> 01:56:44.305]  And so he said it about communism, he said it about Jews, and that's true.
[01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:47.119]  I'm somewhat of a history buff on the Nazis.
[01:56:47.759 --> 01:56:48.579]  Not some expert.
[01:56:48.599 --> 01:56:49.899]  You can read a hundred books and know nothing.
[01:56:49.959 --> 01:56:51.140]  It's a big piece of history.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:53.521]  But I've probably read twenty major books on it.
[01:56:54.221 --> 01:56:55.961]  Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by Scheer.
[01:56:56.281 --> 01:56:57.602]  Heinz Hubble's Order of the Death Star.
[01:56:57.622 --> 01:56:59.422]  These are nine hundred page books, by the way.
[01:57:00.543 --> 01:57:02.183]  And fascinating stuff.
[01:57:02.203 --> 01:57:03.784]  That's what got me into history when I was a little kid.
[01:57:03.804 --> 01:57:04.344]  I started reading it.
[01:57:04.624 --> 01:57:06.185]  I've read Mein Kampf, My Struggle.
[01:57:06.765 --> 01:57:07.505]  I've read a lot more.
[01:57:08.493 --> 01:57:10.334]  And yes, you're right, he also did say that about Jews.
[01:57:10.994 --> 01:57:15.855]  But a lot of people then look at issues and think, oh Alex is lying, he said it was about communists, it's about Jews.
[01:57:16.155 --> 01:57:17.016]  No, it's both.
[01:57:18.536 --> 01:57:28.939]  Goebbels gave hundreds of big lie speeches, and see, I was correct that it is Goebbels, Joseph Goebbels, who gave that speech.
[01:57:28.979 --> 01:57:32.901]  But Hitler also, his speech writer was Joseph Goebbels.
[01:57:35.401 --> 01:57:36.562]  Heinrich Himmler actually
[01:57:37.887 --> 01:57:47.854]  Was his little SS commander, and the fat man, the fat heroin addict, also helped with some of his speeches occasionally early on.
[01:57:49.255 --> 01:57:50.215]  Herman Goring.
[01:57:51.896 --> 01:57:55.979]  Okay, we'll be right back now that we've had our Hitler is Wonderful call.
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:04.805]  And then we'll come back and take more phone calls from France.
[01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:06.711]  They know how great he is.
[01:58:06.831 --> 01:58:08.092]  Over there, they got invaded by him.
[01:58:09.312 --> 01:58:11.994]  Chris, in France, you're next after this 70-second break.
[01:58:12.594 --> 01:58:14.615]  And then I'm going to try to hurry through the rest of the calls, okay?
[01:58:15.695 --> 01:58:16.495]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:58:16.515 --> 01:58:18.136]  This is the GCN Radio Network.

[01:58:26.019 --> 01:58:27.580]  Huge announcement on Monday.
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:29.300]  We're starting the countdown.

[01:58:43.906 --> 01:58:46.028]  A new world order.
[01:58:46.749 --> 01:58:51.154]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:53.386]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:58:54.448 --> 01:58:56.671]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:57.252 --> 01:58:59.675]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:59:00.436 --> 01:59:07.766]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.782 --> 01:59:15.725]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:16.206 --> 01:59:19.648]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.

[01:59:22.650 --> 01:59:23.811]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.831 --> 01:59:24.591]  They're not after money.
[01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:25.672]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.892 --> 01:59:26.613]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.853 --> 01:59:27.693]  That's what they're after.

[02:00:32.545 --> 02:00:34.645]  Big articles coming up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:35.045 --> 02:00:36.906]  Let's go to Chris in France.
[02:00:37.106 --> 02:00:37.466]  Welcome.
[02:00:38.266 --> 02:00:38.666]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:39.286 --> 02:00:39.586]  Hello.
[02:00:39.626 --> 02:00:40.167]  Hello, Alex.
[02:00:40.747 --> 02:00:40.987]  Yes.
[02:00:42.367 --> 02:00:44.927]  It's twenty hundred hours here in Paris.
[02:00:45.328 --> 02:00:47.388]  I've been listening to your show for the last two hours.
[02:00:48.246 --> 02:00:52.650]  And, uh, listening to, um, James Fancher, um, I'm gonna buy the book tomorrow.
[02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:53.511]  That's for sure.
[02:00:54.111 --> 02:00:58.135]  And you know when you talk about the LHC, you know, the, uh, the collider?
[02:00:59.276 --> 02:01:00.537]  Yes, in, uh, Switzerland.
[02:01:02.039 --> 02:01:03.400]  Yeah, you were talking about that one.
[02:01:04.521 --> 02:01:05.742]  Well, there's a lot of them, but go ahead.
[02:01:06.417 --> 02:01:14.319]  No, no, exactly not, because I just discovered that basically it was on the news today and they were talking about that being the largest in the world, basically.
[02:01:14.499 --> 02:01:14.759]  Yes.
[02:01:14.939 --> 02:01:21.361]  And I thought you just mentioned the one you have in the States, which is called Triton, I believe, or something like that.
[02:01:21.701 --> 02:01:22.381]  Yes.
[02:01:22.561 --> 02:01:23.581]  It has a name, okay.
[02:01:23.981 --> 02:01:34.844]  And I just wanted to say to you that you know when I hear you screaming and feeling lonely in your studio back there in the States, I just want you to know that you're not alone.
[02:01:34.924 --> 02:01:35.784]  There's a lot of people
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:37.080]  I think so.
[02:01:58.567 --> 02:02:00.889]  We could create a big message, you know.
[02:02:11.425 --> 02:02:15.066]  I mean, believe me, if I had my druthers, that's where I'd be hanging out.
[02:02:15.566 --> 02:02:17.227]  It's beautiful, it's wonderful, I love it.
[02:02:17.307 --> 02:02:17.747]  Believe me.
[02:02:18.107 --> 02:02:19.908]  Someday, I'm going to have a European tour.
[02:02:20.408 --> 02:02:23.789]  I've turned down probably 50 of them, and I do want to come see everybody over there.
[02:02:24.249 --> 02:02:28.451]  My wife lived over there until she was like 20 years old, so believe me, I want to come.
[02:02:29.411 --> 02:02:33.152]  Listen, I've waited for 20 minutes, so that's probably the most expensive phone call I'm going to make.
[02:02:33.192 --> 02:02:33.893]  Hey, I apologize.
[02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:34.273]  Go ahead.
[02:02:34.433 --> 02:02:35.453]  No, no, don't worry, man.
[02:02:35.493 --> 02:02:36.694]  I just want to say one more thing.
[02:02:37.334 --> 02:02:40.835]  You've talked about, you know, that low-frequency nausea control system.
[02:02:42.939 --> 02:02:44.159]  Say it again, I've talked about what?
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:48.661]  Yes, yes, ultra-low frequency.
[02:02:49.101 --> 02:02:49.281]  Yes.
[02:02:49.481 --> 02:02:57.263]  You know that shit, and in the newspaper today I saw, like, the equivalent, but, you know, just with ultrasonic shit for kids.
[02:02:57.783 --> 02:02:59.244]  You know, against kids, basically.
[02:02:59.264 --> 02:03:00.184]  They're saying that this is...
[02:03:00.889 --> 02:03:05.834]  Uh, for, you know, to push away kids or even people in the streets.
[02:03:05.854 --> 02:03:07.276]  It's called the Mosquito.
[02:03:07.936 --> 02:03:13.201]  London, Paris, New York put ultra-low frequency that actually damages the hearing.
[02:03:13.702 --> 02:03:20.549]  See, you lose the hearing because the low frequency and ultra-low frequency damages the delicate bones.
[02:03:21.309 --> 02:03:25.094]  And so you become deaf to it generally by about 25.
[02:03:25.535 --> 02:03:30.841]  And yes, all over the world they're putting in these devices just to make kids not be on the street.
[02:03:30.901 --> 02:03:33.544]  You don't know why you're being irritated.
[02:03:33.925 --> 02:03:37.589]  That's a mind control weapon being introduced in plain view.
[02:03:37.709 --> 02:03:38.831]  It is incredible.
[02:03:39.434 --> 02:03:49.581]  But Alex, can I just add that I'm a musician myself, yeah, so I know about frequencies, and I don't know if you remember, but in the past, like in the 70s, when they had big concerts, outdoor concerts, people would die.
[02:03:49.901 --> 02:03:51.542]  They wouldn't know where it would come from.
[02:03:51.562 --> 02:03:54.684]  That was coming from the low frequency, not being controlled at the time.
[02:03:55.204 --> 02:03:56.025]  Coming from the bass.
[02:03:56.826 --> 02:03:59.407]  And the low frequency itself can actually kill you.
[02:03:59.828 --> 02:04:04.971]  It's not only a mind control, or to make you feel, you know, noxious or anything like that, it can actually
[02:04:05.572 --> 02:04:11.435]  To actually blow inside your, your, um, your tummy, or your organs and shit like that.
[02:04:11.455 --> 02:04:28.344]  I had, I, well yes, I had read that and you ought to write a blurb up, you ought to post it in the Prison Planet Forum and we'll put it on the main page, uh, because that's right, they're all over, they're now putting it in nationwide in the U.S., damaging your children's ears, hitting them, hitting them hard, uh, just setting the precedent.
[02:04:28.384 --> 02:04:29.805]  Anything else you want to add, Chris?
[02:04:30.717 --> 02:04:32.799]  Yeah, I'm going to get the water test sheet soon as well.
[02:04:32.819 --> 02:04:35.781]  You know, following the pure white shit in the States and in Australia.
[02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:36.542]  Well listen, stay there.
[02:04:36.562 --> 02:04:38.123]  I'm going to let you finish up on the other side.
[02:04:39.024 --> 02:04:44.308]  And we're going to talk to John Rico Morgan Robin.
[02:04:44.528 --> 02:04:46.410]  Robin first, because she's a first-time caller.
[02:04:49.033 --> 02:04:50.715]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:51.015 --> 02:04:54.458]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:54.638 --> 02:04:56.519]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:59.862]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:05:00.183 --> 02:05:05.687]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:05.967 --> 02:05:09.891]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:10.231 --> 02:05:15.173]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:05:15.433 --> 02:05:18.234]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[02:05:18.514 --> 02:05:25.397]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[02:05:25.797 --> 02:05:31.639]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:05:31.799 --> 02:05:36.341]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:05:36.641 --> 02:05:39.163]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:05:39.524 --> 02:05:41.205]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:05:41.585 --> 02:05:43.347]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:05:43.587 --> 02:05:45.389]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:05:45.729 --> 02:05:47.170]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:48.932]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:05:49.492 --> 02:05:51.334]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:05:51.554 --> 02:05:54.597]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:05:54.837 --> 02:05:59.441]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:05:59.801 --> 02:06:02.423]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:06:02.683 --> 02:06:07.547]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[02:06:07.767 --> 02:06:09.548]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:06:09.748 --> 02:06:15.492]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:06:15.733 --> 02:06:17.474]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[02:06:17.854 --> 02:06:21.717]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:06:22.177 --> 02:06:33.184]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[02:06:33.565 --> 02:06:38.628]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[02:06:38.868 --> 02:06:41.890]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[02:06:42.130 --> 02:06:42.590]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[02:06:42.650 --> 02:06:44.351]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[02:06:49.019 --> 02:06:59.222]  USCivilFlags.org is here to help Americans remember as well as our leaders that every man and woman is sovereign and that we're all endowed by our Creator with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:06:59.442 --> 02:07:08.185]  The Sovereign Civil Flag is available at USCivilFlags.org and is a symbol of our desire to return America to the dreams that our forefathers envisioned.
[02:07:08.465 --> 02:07:13.727]  Show your support for a return to traditional moral values by flying one of these great flags today!

[02:07:18.089 --> 02:07:34.535]  USCivilFlags.org also carries a large inventory of Ron Paul related gear including DVDs, buttons, and so on patches, and a large variety of educational books and numerous historical documents, including the US Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Articles of Confederation.
[02:07:34.875 --> 02:07:39.538]  So visit us online today to pick up your piece of history at uscivilflags.org.
[02:07:39.678 --> 02:07:41.540]  That's uscivilflags.org.
[02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:42.160]  Or call us at 646-498-5309.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:42.360]  That's 646-498-5309.
[02:08:05.302 --> 02:08:07.963]  This is an example of how conditioned I have become.
[02:08:10.183 --> 02:08:13.544]  I have seen articles for about five years on the Mosquito.
[02:08:13.584 --> 02:08:14.564]  That's one company.
[02:08:14.925 --> 02:08:15.445]  The biggest one.
[02:08:15.465 --> 02:08:16.285]  There's quite a few.
[02:08:17.605 --> 02:08:19.046]  It's ultra-low frequency.
[02:08:19.066 --> 02:08:24.407]  It's like a... But a lot higher.
[02:08:26.328 --> 02:08:28.568]  And it does damage.
[02:08:29.048 --> 02:08:31.629]  The more you hear it, the more you lose the power to hear it.
[02:08:32.228 --> 02:08:34.489]  My grandmother always should hear dog whistles her whole life.
[02:08:34.529 --> 02:08:35.309]  She's 83 now.
[02:08:35.369 --> 02:08:36.210]  She can still hear them.
[02:08:36.710 --> 02:08:37.690]  She's like super hearing.
[02:08:37.950 --> 02:08:39.191]  Some people have better hearing than average.
[02:08:39.271 --> 02:08:40.411]  Women, on average, have better hearing.
[02:08:40.852 --> 02:08:42.392]  Men, on average, have better eyesight.
[02:08:42.432 --> 02:08:45.193]  It's a genetic trait, but I guess for survival.
[02:08:46.194 --> 02:08:47.794]  But, no, it damages your ears.
[02:08:47.914 --> 02:08:48.655]  And they just put them out.
[02:08:48.695 --> 02:08:52.896]  They say, we don't want young people on the streets of France and Paris and New York.
[02:08:53.517 --> 02:08:54.857]  And so it makes you uncomfortable.
[02:08:54.877 --> 02:08:55.558]  But it says, don't worry.
[02:08:55.598 --> 02:08:56.498]  Adults can't hear it.
[02:08:57.682 --> 02:09:00.004]  But the studies show that you're just not picking it up.
[02:09:00.044 --> 02:09:02.306]  The bones in your ear are actually clattering.
[02:09:02.826 --> 02:09:07.730]  Little bitty tiny bones, some of them the size of hairs, are basically in there clattering around.
[02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:15.436]  And it's the equivalent of sirens going off five inches from your head, but you just don't know it.
[02:09:17.217 --> 02:09:21.421]  And we need to do an article on that because here I am for years saying it and I never even mentioned it.
[02:09:22.161 --> 02:09:24.183]  Now what I did mention and put in Road to Tyranny
[02:09:26.115 --> 02:09:28.836]  Was the supersonic nauseator.
[02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:36.878]  Well, the sonic nauseator and the supersonic nauseator that is in every major law enforcement catalog I've seen, Schumer, Tech, you name it.
[02:09:37.318 --> 02:09:47.640]  And they brag, they say, we take these to, uh, they're very small, we take these to rallies to make everybody sick, we take it to torture people in the jails, and it's hidden in plain, they say that!
[02:09:48.481 --> 02:09:54.322]  It's in the film, we've got a blow-up of the catalog, saying, make people nauseated to break down free speech rallies,
[02:09:54.775 --> 02:09:58.256]  That's illegal, just advertised as illegality, it's completely in your face.
[02:09:58.977 --> 02:10:00.037]  It's all in plain view.
[02:10:01.518 --> 02:10:03.478]  And it's the same thing with these mosquitoes.
[02:10:03.558 --> 02:10:05.559]  They make you uncomfortable, they make you nauseous.
[02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:08.841]  And it says they use them in jails to torture people.
[02:10:10.181 --> 02:10:11.221]  Why would you want to do that?
[02:10:13.903 --> 02:10:19.845]  You see, we're talking about sending people to prison in Abu Ghraib for breaking bones, but cops break bones here and call it paying compliance.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.721]  I've been doing it for 20 years.
[02:10:21.761 --> 02:10:25.205]  I've got a whole section in the extras of my film, Martial Law, covering it.
[02:10:26.166 --> 02:10:29.028]  Speaking of that, I am not plugging my films as much as I used to.
[02:10:29.068 --> 02:10:30.410]  In fact, about 1-100th.
[02:10:31.491 --> 02:10:32.512]  And they're an important tool.
[02:10:32.552 --> 02:10:33.633]  I need to get them out to people.
[02:10:33.733 --> 02:10:36.336]  Martial Law is such a classic, 3-hour long film.
[02:10:36.856 --> 02:10:38.418]  And then like 30 minutes of extras.
[02:10:38.438 --> 02:10:40.560]  It's a DVD 9, just jam-packed.
[02:10:41.701 --> 02:10:51.587]  The Bush-Hitler connection, forget connection, slam dunk, David Gergen blowing up at me, Marshall Law in New York, just 9-11 info, it's three films in one.
[02:10:52.568 --> 02:10:54.529]  Same thing with Endgame, it's really three films.
[02:10:54.569 --> 02:11:09.738]  History of the Global Elite, their physical infrastructure plan, the control grid, NAU, European Union, Asian Union, African Union, and then their master plan after it's in place, and their current black ops, eugenics, soft kill program, they're running against each and every one of us listening.
[02:11:11.559 --> 02:11:14.022]  And then Terror Storm, the final cut.
[02:11:14.182 --> 02:11:15.864]  It's a second edition, the final edition.
[02:11:15.884 --> 02:11:17.906]  It's like two plus hours long.
[02:11:19.147 --> 02:11:20.149]  An hour of extras.
[02:11:20.209 --> 02:11:20.949]  Ventura's in it.
[02:11:22.451 --> 02:11:24.954]  It's all available at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:24.994 --> 02:11:26.155]  And let's say you've already got Endgame.
[02:11:26.175 --> 02:11:27.296]  Let's say you've already got Terror Storm.
[02:11:27.316 --> 02:11:27.997]  You want to support us?
[02:11:28.337 --> 02:11:29.238]  Buy some more copies.
[02:11:29.359 --> 02:11:30.200]  Give it to somebody.
[02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:42.807]  That's InfoWars.com or you can simply call toll free 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or write to me I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100 Austin Texas 78704 and of course PrisonPlanet.tv which is going to have a lot of new features getting added in the next week.
[02:11:42.827 --> 02:11:44.708]  Not being two weeks but maximum two weeks we're going to
[02:12:01.354 --> 02:12:05.798]  Have an hour of video a day for members in studio.
[02:12:05.818 --> 02:12:07.559]  I'm going to have a document box where I put documents.
[02:12:07.579 --> 02:12:08.800]  I'm going to play video clips on air.
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:10.341]  You'll be able to see them as members.
[02:12:11.582 --> 02:12:12.903]  Sneak peeks on films.
[02:12:13.704 --> 02:12:14.064]  Everything.
[02:12:15.405 --> 02:12:19.328]  So that's going to start in the next few weeks.
[02:12:19.429 --> 02:12:20.790]  That is not the big announcement.
[02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:23.372]  There's a separate huge announcement coming up Monday.
[02:12:23.392 --> 02:12:24.893]  I'm telling you, for weeks we're going to have that soon.
[02:12:24.913 --> 02:12:26.174]  A lot of other stuff, though.
[02:12:27.432 --> 02:12:33.717]  And so, PrisonPlanet.tv, you can download all my films in super high quality and burn them to disk and give them to people.
[02:12:35.398 --> 02:12:37.160]  Whatever you do, give them the high quality.
[02:12:41.783 --> 02:12:42.744]  It's so important.
[02:12:43.965 --> 02:12:46.326]  PrisonPlanet.tv, you can get three months free right now.
[02:12:46.386 --> 02:12:47.247]  Go check out that offer.

[02:12:49.329 --> 02:12:52.571]  That's the cost of two and a half cups of Starbucks coffee.
[02:12:53.372 --> 02:12:55.193]  Small cups, or using double think.
[02:12:55.888 --> 02:12:58.270]  Hello Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[02:13:15.097 --> 02:13:20.680]  If you ever want to come to Great Smoky Mountains in East Tennessee, you have an open invitation to stay at my home with my family.
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:22.400]  Oh, I love the Smokies.
[02:13:22.500 --> 02:13:24.441]  I've got a wanderlust, but I can't ever do it.
[02:13:24.862 --> 02:13:25.702]  Oh, it's beautiful now.
[02:13:25.722 --> 02:13:26.542]  It's springtime.
[02:13:26.642 --> 02:13:27.863]  All the trees are blooming.
[02:13:27.903 --> 02:13:31.565]  No, I've rock climbed and marched up quite a few of your hills.
[02:13:32.245 --> 02:13:33.205]  Quite a few of your mountains.
[02:13:33.265 --> 02:13:40.068]  I love the snow on the ground, the pine trees, and you come up out of the clouds on a spire of a mountain and you're overlooking the Smokies.
[02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.949]  Oh my gosh.
[02:13:41.489 --> 02:13:42.750]  It sounds like you've been here.
[02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:45.192]  Pull out that thermos of coffee out of your backpack.
[02:13:45.232 --> 02:13:47.133]  You just walked, you know, eight miles up the mountain.
[02:13:47.153 --> 02:13:49.934]  You just drink that delicious coffee up there.
[02:13:49.995 --> 02:13:50.475]  Nothing better.
[02:13:51.395 --> 02:13:53.257]  You're next to heaven, that's for sure.
[02:13:53.577 --> 02:13:56.078]  I wanted to ask you about a pre-9-1.
[02:13:56.459 --> 02:13:58.520]  They were talking about this yellow cake from Nigeria.
[02:13:59.813 --> 02:14:11.784]  Do you think it could be possible, you know, they use this in replace of sulfur and thermate, if they use something sub-nuclear or sub-atomic, would it be able to pulverize and atomize all the steel and the concrete?
[02:14:11.804 --> 02:14:19.111]  You know, I'm not an engineer or physicist or demolitions expert, but I don't think they'd use masses of isotopes because they wouldn't want to pick up, you know, have it be picked up.
[02:14:19.671 --> 02:14:22.274]  The problem is, major British scientists and others,
[02:14:23.135 --> 02:14:28.339]  Major institutions have found really high levels of different isotopes at the towers that can't be explained.
[02:14:28.599 --> 02:14:29.700]  Yeah, that's one of the things.
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:34.944]  I thought the satellites picked up some radioactivity and they didn't report on it much.
[02:14:36.706 --> 02:14:43.211]  In one of the Kraton books, it talks about this sub-frequency machine that could also vibrate.
[02:14:43.331 --> 02:14:48.415]  It's almost, you know, you almost like melt the... We know the government's developed those.
[02:14:50.087 --> 02:14:53.089]  And some people want to say that that's what knocked the buildings down.
[02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:57.010]  It's just that is political seppuku to come out and say that.
[02:14:57.050 --> 02:15:00.452]  Plus, I don't believe particle beams did it.
[02:15:00.972 --> 02:15:01.693]  Yeah.
[02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:11.097]  And it appears to be conventional high-powered explosives, but way overloaded, like Jesse Ventura said, where they just put two, three times what was needed.
[02:15:12.778 --> 02:15:13.878]  That's tower one and two.
[02:15:13.978 --> 02:15:15.039]  Seven is a conventional.
[02:15:15.575 --> 02:15:16.055]  Exactly.
[02:15:16.095 --> 02:15:21.097]  I mean, it makes you wonder about, you know, people who can't believe what their own eyes see.
[02:15:21.137 --> 02:15:26.100]  And when I bring up a lot of people around here, you know, they come up with all these excuses.
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:27.780]  Well, can't you believe what you see?
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:32.222]  I mean, where are you at in your life that you're going to deny what your own eyes see?
[02:15:33.503 --> 02:15:36.464]  But I really admire your show and appreciate all you do.
[02:15:37.465 --> 02:15:38.325]  Absolutely, my friend.
[02:15:38.345 --> 02:15:39.025]  Thank you for calling.
[02:15:39.145 --> 02:15:40.286]  Oh, before I forget,
[02:15:43.146 --> 02:15:46.848]  Just remind me, caller, because I'm going to get to it later so I have time to talk to all the calls.
[02:15:47.248 --> 02:15:48.289]  We've been censored again.
[02:15:50.010 --> 02:15:58.374]  Well, that radio blogger's site openly tells people we're banned, all 9-11 truth is banned, they say it's all lies, they just say, we say you're a liar, the world is flat, you're banned.
[02:15:59.174 --> 02:16:10.400]  But AOL's social networking site put out an official statement saying Prison Planet is banned, and that was a story yesterday up on PrisonPlanet.com
[02:16:11.593 --> 02:16:14.474]  People tell us that libraries all over the country say we're banned.
[02:16:14.974 --> 02:16:22.056]  We know, it's been in the news for years, it's been admitted that InfoWars and Prison Planet are in the list of banned software.
[02:16:22.076 --> 02:16:32.079]  That is, libraries, corporations, schools, universities, institutions buy filtering software and it advertises.
[02:16:32.399 --> 02:16:36.961]  Filters out porn, filters out hate, filters out gambling, filters out hacking.
[02:16:37.001 --> 02:16:38.301]  Those are the four big
[02:16:39.816 --> 02:16:41.957]  Genres that are filtered.
[02:16:43.178 --> 02:16:46.880]  And what do you want to guess is in hacking and hate?
[02:16:49.321 --> 02:17:00.928]  But InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and then we can start a new website and it can suddenly get on all the other big sites and get a lot of traffic and then in about six months to a year the new version comes out and baby they're on it.
[02:17:01.948 --> 02:17:08.952]  Another reason I've started more sites and this is internet too where they just wall you off for more and more more and more major platforms
[02:17:10.348 --> 02:17:12.830]  It's been admitted that Comcast has filtered us out.
[02:17:13.391 --> 02:17:17.354]  British telecoms, though they stopped doing it because they filtered a bunch of people and got in trouble.
[02:17:17.794 --> 02:17:19.836]  A bunch of different British telecoms have done it.
[02:17:22.938 --> 02:17:25.040]  So, we are filtered out all over the place.
[02:17:25.180 --> 02:17:30.244]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are websites they don't want you to get to.
[02:17:30.705 --> 02:17:32.186]  Try TruthNews.us.
[02:17:32.226 --> 02:17:33.947]  Try RonPaulWarRoom.com.
[02:17:34.528 --> 02:17:36.910]  Try MartialLaw911.info.
[02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:38.071]  Try ArnoldExposed.
[02:17:39.545 --> 02:17:48.907]  I think the answer is every year have a new mirror site for each site and have my webmasters upload to the mirror for that year.
[02:17:50.567 --> 02:17:53.688]  And then in a year discharge that website.
[02:17:54.208 --> 02:17:57.989]  I just don't have the money for employees and extra IT folks who already work to the bone.
[02:17:58.309 --> 02:18:01.570]  So buy some videos from me because if the capital comes in we'll just hire more people.
[02:18:01.590 --> 02:18:06.131]  I mean we have to, we're fighting, we'd rather have you put pressure on the companies and
[02:18:06.764 --> 02:18:08.725]  But it's just getting to where he says censorship works.
[02:18:09.266 --> 02:18:15.730]  You complain about one, you fight another, you fight, you fight, and pretty soon it's kind of like RFID adoption in all products.
[02:18:17.511 --> 02:18:22.094]  Walmart and the Defense Department order all their suppliers in 2000 to have it in by 2004.
[02:18:22.134 --> 02:18:24.715]  They fail, but they're now setting new deadlines for the end of this year.
[02:18:24.795 --> 02:18:26.296]  Most companies have now complied.
[02:18:27.777 --> 02:18:31.740]  So early on we could protest Procter & Gamble or Gillette or Michelin.
[02:18:33.436 --> 02:18:37.337]  Campbell's, but now we just can't because once it's universal and they talk about that.
[02:18:37.678 --> 02:18:38.618]  It's like thumb scanners.
[02:18:39.038 --> 02:18:40.398]  We've been protesting and fighting it.
[02:18:41.639 --> 02:18:43.219]  Thumb scanners in the school lunches.
[02:18:43.239 --> 02:18:44.720]  Thumb scanners in the grocery stores.
[02:18:44.980 --> 02:18:46.401]  Thumb scanners at the megachurches.
[02:18:46.421 --> 02:18:48.121]  Thumb scanners to get into work.
[02:18:48.981 --> 02:18:53.303]  Once you get massive implementation, it's almost impossible to reverse it.
[02:18:53.323 --> 02:18:54.423]  It makes it a hundred times harder.
[02:18:54.603 --> 02:19:00.325]  We're now reaching 20-30% depending on whose survey you look at, but a large portion of the U.S.
[02:19:00.646 --> 02:19:01.766]  now has these integrated.
[02:19:05.154 --> 02:19:06.075]  You understand, folks?
[02:19:06.515 --> 02:19:10.818]  So they're integrating total censorship of InfoWars and Prison Planet right now.
[02:19:10.858 --> 02:19:13.480]  That's why we need you to tell your friends and family about the sites.
[02:19:13.921 --> 02:19:16.082]  We need you to spread the word about them or we won't be here.
[02:19:17.323 --> 02:19:20.806]  There'll come a day where it's very hard to get to our sites.
[02:19:22.888 --> 02:19:24.449]  And, uh, or very hard to find us.
[02:19:24.729 --> 02:19:26.190]  We'll be walled off everywhere.
[02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:32.135]  They're trying to kill the viral nature of our information warfare frequency.
[02:19:33.596 --> 02:19:34.857]  They're trying to block it.
[02:19:36.149 --> 02:19:39.791]  And you bet they better block it because we're like a virus that's gonna bring down their system.
[02:19:40.172 --> 02:19:41.513]  But we're a virus that gives life.
[02:19:41.893 --> 02:19:45.055]  We're actually an antibiotic that's blocking their bacterial infection.
[02:19:45.535 --> 02:19:47.516]  So they're trying to create a toxin to block us.
[02:19:49.318 --> 02:19:50.718]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:51.799 --> 02:19:52.840]  A new world order.
[02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:54.481]  In the near future.
[02:19:55.365 --> 02:19:57.987]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:58.447 --> 02:20:00.589]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:03.491]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:04.052 --> 02:20:06.514]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:07.234 --> 02:20:14.560]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:17.594 --> 02:20:22.575]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:23.036 --> 02:20:26.496]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.917 --> 02:20:29.357]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:29.457 --> 02:20:30.598]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:30.618 --> 02:20:31.398]  They're not after money.
[02:20:31.418 --> 02:20:32.478]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.698 --> 02:20:33.398]  They're after power.
[02:20:33.678 --> 02:20:34.499]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:22:47.967 --> 02:22:48.247]  Fact.
[02:22:48.427 --> 02:22:54.332]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:22:54.452 --> 02:22:58.715]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:22:58.815 --> 02:23:06.301]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:23:06.521 --> 02:23:07.161]  The solution.
[02:23:07.301 --> 02:23:11.344]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.

[02:23:13.666 --> 02:23:14.026]  I'm good.
[02:23:33.581 --> 02:23:34.221]  I hurt myself today.
[02:24:01.987 --> 02:24:26.439]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
[02:24:33.644 --> 02:24:45.192]  All right, John in Wyoming, thanks for holding.
[02:24:45.212 --> 02:24:47.453]  We're on the air.
[02:24:48.054 --> 02:24:48.454]  I have it.
[02:24:48.914 --> 02:24:49.075]  Yes.
[02:24:49.175 --> 02:24:54.298]  Yeah, there was something in the local paper here in Cheyenne, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle, on March 16, 2008.
[02:24:56.263 --> 02:24:59.105]  And the headline reads, Supercomputer Awaiting Approval.
[02:24:59.145 --> 02:25:07.311]  What they're doing is the National Science Foundation has to authorize a supercomputer facility which will be located here in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[02:25:08.072 --> 02:25:21.381]  Now what they're claiming is they're going to use it to predict the path of hurricanes and tornadoes to gauge the need for evacuations as well as examining air pollution and drought conditions to make informed economic decisions.
[02:25:21.441 --> 02:25:22.422]  However, you and I
[02:25:22.910 --> 02:25:26.071]  I don't know what the government usually does with their supercomputers.
[02:25:26.111 --> 02:25:28.652]  It's all part of the server in the sky.
[02:25:28.772 --> 02:25:40.275]  Each person in the Pentagon and the FBI's involved in it, in the world now, has a simulated individual that all your data, all your mining, in fact, that's the next news story I'm going to cover, is put into.
[02:25:41.296 --> 02:25:45.037]  And then they can also say, oh, the computer says you have to evacuate.
[02:25:45.417 --> 02:25:47.657]  The computer says you've got to hand your guns in.
[02:25:48.038 --> 02:25:49.058]  It's the new expert.
[02:25:49.878 --> 02:25:52.479]  Yeah, well, another thing, too, let me bring up another point.
[02:25:52.970 --> 02:25:56.911]  Now you and I know that your good friend George Norrie is a wonderful guy.
[02:25:56.931 --> 02:25:58.452]  He's a patriot and all of that.
[02:25:58.952 --> 02:26:02.893]  But his producer and his phone screeners are ringers, believe me.
[02:26:03.333 --> 02:26:11.796]  Because when you were on and the last time, I don't know if you remember me calling in whenever you were on, not the last time, but the time before everything went hunky-dory.
[02:26:12.376 --> 02:26:20.038]  But when you were on Alex's, I mean George's program again, and I tried to call through, they wouldn't even pick up my phone.
[02:26:20.078 --> 02:26:22.519]  And when Tom Danhauser used to answer the phones,
[02:26:23.138 --> 02:26:36.005]  I would call through, and he would put me on hold, and then he'd cut me off a few seconds later, and I did this five, six times in a row, and he claimed that, oh, he was having problems with the phone service, when in fact he kept
[02:26:36.656 --> 02:26:43.700]  Telling people to call in, and everybody else's call got through, but mine he would keep cutting off every time I would cut through to talk about it.
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:50.064]  Well look, I mean, Tom's a really nice guy to me, and so is George, and I'm personal friends with them, and I've gotten to know them, and they're nothing but sweethearts to me.
[02:26:50.564 --> 02:26:57.048]  And I've been in studio while they're taking calls, and most of the time they just get your name and where you're calling from, and sometimes not even that.
[02:26:57.789 --> 02:27:01.511]  But Liz, so I really, I mean, it's pointless for me to just come on and bash them, you know?
[02:27:02.151 --> 02:27:09.114]  But I mean, they won't even pick up my call now, whenever you have Ron Paul on there as a guest, because I've been a personal friend of Ron since 1972.
[02:27:10.234 --> 02:27:10.814]  How do you know?
[02:27:10.894 --> 02:27:12.495]  They don't have Caller ID on those phones.
[02:27:13.175 --> 02:27:15.576]  I don't know, but it doesn't get through.
[02:27:15.616 --> 02:27:16.477]  They won't pick it up.
[02:27:16.977 --> 02:27:22.199]  And when I was calling and Tom was answering the telephones, he would hang up on me.
[02:27:22.679 --> 02:27:23.859]  And so I don't know why.
[02:27:23.899 --> 02:27:25.540]  Okay, well listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:26.420]  I just can't help you.
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:27.521]  That's another radio show.
[02:27:29.264 --> 02:27:29.524]  I don't know.
[02:27:29.544 --> 02:27:32.746]  I've been in studio with George three times.
[02:27:33.086 --> 02:27:34.807]  I guess for a total of about nine hours.
[02:27:35.528 --> 02:27:37.009]  I've been out to eat with him a few times.
[02:27:37.229 --> 02:27:39.330]  I've been to events he's invited me to.
[02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:42.111]  And that's it.
[02:27:42.312 --> 02:27:47.755]  I mean, I just... These shows aren't... These calls aren't screened here.
[02:27:47.795 --> 02:27:48.655]  You can call in.
[02:27:48.895 --> 02:27:49.336]  Call in.
[02:27:49.876 --> 02:27:50.636]  Talk about other shows.
[02:27:50.676 --> 02:27:51.737]  Call answers.
[02:27:51.777 --> 02:27:52.157]  I don't know.
[02:27:52.177 --> 02:27:53.758]  I'm not trying to get in a fight with you, sir.
[02:27:53.798 --> 02:27:55.119]  It just really isn't news here.
[02:27:56.059 --> 02:27:57.180]  I mean, want me to bash him?
[02:27:58.260 --> 02:28:00.622]  I need to go on that show and reach people that have never censored me.
[02:28:00.682 --> 02:28:01.162]  I know that.
[02:28:01.903 --> 02:28:02.983]  I'm pretty radical, folks.
[02:28:03.544 --> 02:28:05.405]  They've never told me what I can talk about on that show.
[02:28:07.806 --> 02:28:09.727]  Now, they do research what you claim.
[02:28:11.428 --> 02:28:16.471]  First time I went on there, they just said, okay, what are your 20 questions?
[02:28:17.592 --> 02:28:22.295]  And then they went and actually, I later found out, went and researched each and every one of them to find out it wasn't slander or libel.
[02:28:22.987 --> 02:28:24.188]  So they do do their research.
[02:28:24.708 --> 02:28:29.991]  That's why you hear me on that show, because they know I'm covering something that's from a source.
[02:28:32.152 --> 02:28:40.876]  See, they either cover fun things, as George calls it, you know, Pyramid Shows, Atlanta Shows, it's interesting, it's entertaining.
[02:28:41.257 --> 02:28:42.757]  Ghost shows, I mean, I listen to those.
[02:28:43.318 --> 02:28:50.522]  I'm sometimes myself sick of the New World Order stuff, so I'll be driving along listening to the funny ghost stories, you know, and looking behind me in the seat at midnight and driving home.
[02:28:52.182 --> 02:28:56.504]  But, uh, because, you know, I've been working until midnight on the New World Order.
[02:28:56.524 --> 02:28:57.445]  I want to hear something else.
[02:28:57.545 --> 02:29:00.487]  Driving home for 30 minutes, that's kind of like my vacation and my rest each day.
[02:29:01.547 --> 02:29:06.790]  And, uh, but then when they do serious shows, you know, they got to be careful.
[02:29:07.070 --> 02:29:12.073]  Because, uh, and they do that by trying to have people on who have credibility.
[02:29:13.574 --> 02:29:14.494]  But they've never censored me.
[02:29:14.574 --> 02:29:15.175]  They're great folks.
[02:29:15.675 --> 02:29:17.496]  Okay, I got to one call in that five minutes.
[02:29:17.636 --> 02:29:21.278]  I want to take your calls, but I got a bunch of news I need to get to, too.
[02:29:22.672 --> 02:29:26.195]  Um... Let me see here.
[02:29:26.315 --> 02:29:29.317]  Wesley, Rocco, Morgan, John, a few others.
[02:29:29.797 --> 02:29:30.578]  We're gonna get to you quick.
[02:29:30.598 --> 02:29:32.559]  Just be ready with your comments, because I am gonna move quick.
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:36.582]  Then I got some important news about the military spying on the American people.
[02:29:39.104 --> 02:29:40.005]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.505 --> 02:29:42.106]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.027 --> 02:29:45.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.639 --> 02:29:56.263]  Have you noticed how every type of gadget these days requires some specific type of battery?
[02:29:56.383 --> 02:29:58.345]  It doesn't matter what kind of gadget you're using.
[02:29:58.385 --> 02:30:00.387]  We all take different sizes and types of batteries.
[02:30:00.548 --> 02:30:02.510]  That's where BatteryStation.com comes in.
[02:30:02.650 --> 02:30:03.791]  More like Battery Heaven.
[02:30:03.891 --> 02:30:08.376]  BatteryStation.com has every type of battery you can think of at extreme low prices.
[02:30:08.556 --> 02:30:08.876]  We're good.
[02:30:27.094 --> 02:30:27.554]  I think so.
[02:30:49.397 --> 02:30:52.338]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:30:52.498 --> 02:30:57.719]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:30:58.019 --> 02:31:03.360]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:04.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:14.202]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:31:14.542 --> 02:31:16.144]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[02:31:50.120 --> 02:31:55.843]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[02:31:56.203 --> 02:32:01.805]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[02:32:02.145 --> 02:32:06.007]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[02:32:06.287 --> 02:32:11.229]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:18.893]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[02:32:58.232 --> 02:33:08.357]  All right, let's dispense with the pleasantries.
[02:33:08.457 --> 02:33:12.178]  And let's come back and go to your calls.
[02:33:12.599 --> 02:33:14.519]  Rocco in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:33:14.559 --> 02:33:15.120]  Thanks for holding.
[02:33:15.140 --> 02:33:15.380]  Hello.
[02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:16.200]  Yes, sir.
[02:33:17.401 --> 02:33:17.781]  Hi, Alex.
[02:33:18.891 --> 02:33:21.634]  My question was about WorldNetDaily and Joseph Farrar.
[02:33:22.154 --> 02:33:27.399]  At first, I didn't believe when you said certain people were agents, but it appears you're right about Savage.
[02:33:28.079 --> 02:33:28.880]  What's your take on him?
[02:33:31.062 --> 02:33:34.645]  Well, I mean, Savage is saying George Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[02:33:35.726 --> 02:33:38.809]  I'm giving you my example of why Savage is a fake conservative.
[02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:41.952]  Look, I'm not going to get into a bashing contest with Farrar.
[02:33:41.972 --> 02:33:43.073]  They've done a lot of good.
[02:33:43.954 --> 02:33:50.157]  They were there at the start of the web and really taught me a lot and published a lot of stories I put together and photos I published.
[02:33:50.197 --> 02:33:54.519]  And then when Bush got in and 9-11 happened, they really shifted.
[02:33:54.539 --> 02:33:59.161]  And you can see their numbers, they destroyed themselves to a great extent.
[02:33:59.181 --> 02:34:00.481]  You know, they're still a big force.
[02:34:01.742 --> 02:34:03.583]  But really, it's sad.
[02:34:04.323 --> 02:34:06.044]  And I don't think it's fair as an agent.
[02:34:06.104 --> 02:34:10.286]  I know Terry Reid, the former CIA officer exposed government drug dealing by Clinton and Bush.
[02:34:11.161 --> 02:34:15.524]  runs their shipping department out of Kansas City and listens to the show.
[02:34:16.645 --> 02:34:19.367]  So I know people inside the organization are patriots.
[02:34:20.608 --> 02:34:28.433]  I just think that Farah is a Lebanese Christian, and boy, they hate Arabs like nothing you've ever seen.
[02:34:28.733 --> 02:34:29.434]  Muslim Arabs.
[02:34:30.074 --> 02:34:35.278]  And so I just think it's Joseph Farah is a Lebanese Christian, and I think he genuinely believes the stuff he puts out.
[02:34:36.144 --> 02:34:44.751]  Yeah, with 9-11, they've completely blocked out any debate, and I think that's part of the reason why DV Kid doesn't write for them anymore.
[02:34:45.912 --> 02:34:53.098]  Yeah, I think WorldNetDaily, still, it's a lot better than the New York Times, a lot better than the Washington Post.
[02:34:53.138 --> 02:34:58.342]  I mean, some articles about them grabbing homeschool kids, or the Second Amendment, dead on.
[02:34:58.642 --> 02:35:01.945]  I mean, they've got tons of, they fight the North American Union.
[02:35:03.116 --> 02:35:03.997]  And they're getting better.
[02:35:04.037 --> 02:35:09.700]  I mean, I think they drank the Kool-Aid in 2001 and they stopped drinking it about a year ago to a certain extent.
[02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:11.321]  Thanks.
[02:35:11.701 --> 02:35:15.743]  Alex, do you have any plans of doing a documentary just on media manipulation?
[02:35:16.123 --> 02:35:17.824]  I would love to, yes, and I've meant to.
[02:35:17.884 --> 02:35:18.404]  I just can't.
[02:35:19.545 --> 02:35:24.948]  I can't do it all, but that is on the front burner to try to do something like that.
[02:35:24.968 --> 02:35:25.788]  I appreciate your call.
[02:35:26.148 --> 02:35:26.949]  Really good questions.
[02:35:27.069 --> 02:35:29.870]  Rocco, not only asks great questions, he's got a cool name.
[02:35:30.631 --> 02:35:31.031]  Rocco.
[02:35:34.063 --> 02:35:36.165]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:35:36.665 --> 02:35:37.646]  John, you're on the air.
[02:35:37.706 --> 02:35:38.046]  Welcome.
[02:35:38.686 --> 02:35:39.147]  Hey, Alex.
[02:35:39.207 --> 02:35:45.311]  Last time I talked to you, I'm a Marine, and the gentleman from Lakota Nation was on.
[02:35:45.351 --> 02:35:50.034]  We talked about the guy who I think killed the puppy and was doing some stuff like that.
[02:35:50.795 --> 02:35:58.080]  We spoke about how a lot of these Marines and soldiers and guys coming back who are fighting, and I've seen it myself.
[02:35:59.833 --> 02:36:07.615]  We've been trained, we've been led to some stuff that's pro-martial law, but I don't want to talk about that today.
[02:36:07.635 --> 02:36:26.541]  What I want to talk about is to these people, to these intelligence officers, listen, to these sergeants, to these staff sergeants, stuff, and say, you know, to the guys that call in and threaten you, or call you on the phone, I know guys like this, and I want to tell them they're jokes, that they're worthless as clown shoes,
[02:36:27.267 --> 02:36:28.588]  You know, they're pointless.
[02:36:29.268 --> 02:36:31.150]  They're getting trinkets like little whores.
[02:36:32.170 --> 02:36:34.152]  It just really upsets me that they're going to lose.
[02:36:34.712 --> 02:36:38.094]  The meek will inherit the earth.
[02:36:38.654 --> 02:36:43.378]  I've been really down with all the economic news lately, but just hearing Jesse Ventura calling got me going.
[02:36:44.979 --> 02:36:49.061]  I had a question for you about the scientific dictatorship.
[02:36:49.081 --> 02:36:52.384]  You said you read it, and I just really think Endgame's really comparable to that.
[02:36:52.444 --> 02:36:56.106]  Now, the ascendancy of the scientific dictatorship, I'd recommend that people read it.
[02:36:56.733 --> 02:37:01.736]  And I was wondering if you better have the Collins Brothers on, who wrote it, or if you plan to have them on.
[02:37:01.756 --> 02:37:03.317]  No, I need to have them on.
[02:37:03.697 --> 02:37:08.239]  That's a good idea, the Collins Brothers, the ascendancy of the scientific dictatorship.
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:09.840]  We'll try to do that.
[02:37:10.381 --> 02:37:23.828]  But I just want to say, you have more spirit of the Marine Corps, like Chesty Puller, Smedley Butler, than all these guys who are down with the New World Order, and as a disabled veteran who's dying, I just want to tell you,
[02:37:24.383 --> 02:37:26.683]  You know, when you have everything to lose, you have nothing to lose.
[02:37:27.124 --> 02:37:28.944]  So let's stand up, let's fight this.
[02:37:29.784 --> 02:37:31.924]  The feds, the New World Order, they have nothing against us.
[02:37:32.184 --> 02:37:34.745]  Well, God bless you, my friend, and I really appreciate your spirit.
[02:37:35.265 --> 02:37:41.406]  Listen, I don't claim to be the toughest guy around, and I don't claim to be able to march with a 100-pound pack through the desert, so I'm not a tough guy.
[02:37:42.086 --> 02:37:48.588]  But I know this, if you're trying to bring me down, and it doesn't matter, I mean, if you got me, I'm going to be biting your heels.
[02:37:49.768 --> 02:37:50.788]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:37:52.037 --> 02:37:54.078]  And to me, it's not being a tough guy.
[02:37:54.138 --> 02:37:54.919]  It's who I am.
[02:37:55.239 --> 02:37:58.760]  I am going to fight you, and I'm not going to give in to you, because I can't.
[02:37:59.881 --> 02:38:01.802]  I mean, it's not even a question of courage.
[02:38:02.222 --> 02:38:03.163]  These people are killers.
[02:38:03.643 --> 02:38:04.283]  They're scum.
[02:38:04.303 --> 02:38:04.844]  They're filth.
[02:38:05.264 --> 02:38:05.984]  They're trash.
[02:38:06.745 --> 02:38:09.126]  And I look at the little people, the children, the women.
[02:38:10.046 --> 02:38:11.587]  We have to fight this evil for them.
[02:38:12.908 --> 02:38:14.048]  That's what it is to be a man.
[02:38:14.869 --> 02:38:17.950]  And I appreciate you, sir, but, you know, I act like a fool sometimes.
[02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:18.671]  I yell and scream.
[02:38:18.731 --> 02:38:19.311]  I am a nut.
[02:38:20.626 --> 02:38:21.107]  I'm a nut.
[02:38:21.147 --> 02:38:21.907]  That's part of me.
[02:38:21.967 --> 02:38:23.809]  But I also am intelligent at other levels.
[02:38:23.909 --> 02:38:25.571]  I'm a multifaceted person like everybody.
[02:38:26.292 --> 02:38:27.113]  I'm an intellectual.
[02:38:27.213 --> 02:38:28.354]  I research things.
[02:38:28.434 --> 02:38:29.635]  I study science.
[02:38:30.556 --> 02:38:33.339]  But then I get on air and I start thinking about it and I just go crazy.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:36.742]  Because at my core, that's who I am.
[02:38:36.782 --> 02:38:39.084]  I'm just a wild dog, basically.
[02:38:43.883 --> 02:38:56.714]  I just know there's a bunch of scientific freaks running everything, and they think we're all a bunch of idiots who deserve to be slaves, and I don't want to be a slave, and I don't want my family being hurt, and I don't want your family being hurt, and I know that none of us are safe until we bring down this new world order.
[02:38:56.754 --> 02:38:57.555]  That's all I know!
[02:38:58.756 --> 02:39:00.037]  I know I didn't ask for this fight.
[02:39:02.499 --> 02:39:03.540]  We're not looking for a fight.
[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:04.280]  I don't want a fight.
[02:39:06.042 --> 02:39:07.103]  I want to go just live my life.
[02:39:08.044 --> 02:39:08.765]  They don't stop.
[02:39:08.845 --> 02:39:11.807]  They draw first blood on us over and over and over again.
[02:39:12.047 --> 02:39:16.149]  They keep pushing us and shoving us and asking for it and they're gonna get it.
[02:39:17.770 --> 02:39:18.371]  And they know that.
[02:39:18.411 --> 02:39:20.692]  That's why they're trying to get their control grid in place.
[02:39:21.533 --> 02:39:22.994]  And they got so many well-meaning people.
[02:39:23.034 --> 02:39:28.137]  I mean, these guys would turn them into a glass parking lot, terrorist hunting, licenses on their cars.
[02:39:28.157 --> 02:39:30.559]  If you meet that guy, he's the nicest guy in the world.
[02:39:30.839 --> 02:39:32.380]  He'll come over and help you paint your house.
[02:39:33.801 --> 02:39:35.382]  He'll water your yard for you.
[02:39:35.442 --> 02:39:36.783]  He's a fun guy to go fishing with.
[02:39:37.583 --> 02:39:42.987]  But he is weak minded when it comes to being able to face that he's been used.
[02:39:44.028 --> 02:39:48.070]  He's got the courage to run up a hillside towards a foxhole.
[02:39:48.911 --> 02:39:51.973]  But does he have the moral courage to admit the larger issues?
[02:39:56.176 --> 02:39:58.698]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:39:59.258 --> 02:40:00.920]  Dan in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:02.541]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:40:02.661 --> 02:40:02.841]  Good.
[02:40:03.737 --> 02:40:06.398]  Hey, um, you've definitely become a hero of mine the past month.
[02:40:06.438 --> 02:40:26.006]  I'm actually surprised that you haven't been assassinated yet, but I had a question about, um, when Jesse Ventura was on earlier, he said that he was surprised that Obama has been assassinated, or he will be assassinated, but isn't Obama also a part of the CFR, so isn't he trying to, uh, further the, uh, the New World Order himself?
[02:40:26.507 --> 02:40:32.169]  Yes, but he's saying he's anti-war, and I think Ventura's saying that if he really tries to get us out of that war,
[02:40:33.689 --> 02:40:37.311]  With the hundreds of billions every few months and no-bid contracts, they'll kill him in a minute.
[02:40:37.852 --> 02:40:45.316]  See, it's not about being patriotic, it's not about fighting Al-Qaeda, it's about a bunch of old dirtbags making money while our patriotic men go off and die.
[02:40:47.958 --> 02:40:51.640]  Absolutely, yeah, and I think that will be there for as long as they want us there.
[02:40:51.680 --> 02:40:56.463]  Well, I know this, there are a lot of racists who are going to do everything they can to kill Obama.
[02:40:56.963 --> 02:41:01.606]  So if he becomes president, he better have so much secur- and there's a lot of nutty black groups, too.
[02:41:02.512 --> 02:41:08.656]  You know, the government will probably hire a black group to kill them like they did Malcolm X. I mean, there's just no end to it.
[02:41:08.676 --> 02:41:09.396]  I appreciate your call.
[02:41:09.416 --> 02:41:10.277]  We've got to move quick here.
[02:41:10.337 --> 02:41:12.798]  Rachel, in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:41:14.039 --> 02:41:14.599]  Big guy.
[02:41:14.619 --> 02:41:15.760]  How are you, big guy?
[02:41:16.020 --> 02:41:16.600]  Big guy?
[02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:17.241]  Big potbelly?
[02:41:17.261 --> 02:41:18.341]  You are absolutely right.
[02:41:18.822 --> 02:41:20.062]  I was at the store.
[02:41:20.342 --> 02:41:20.983]  They were doing
[02:41:21.607 --> 02:41:32.335]  In the middle of doing their inventory, they were not only messing around with the food, but now they got certain things in there that is no longer in stock, can't get it, won't get it.
[02:41:32.735 --> 02:41:41.741]  You were right, and we're right in the middle of the Depression, and I told people, and I told my family, and I'm hoping that they're listening to you, because you're absolutely right.
[02:41:42.322 --> 02:41:44.383]  Keep up the good work, and I'm ready!
[02:41:44.683 --> 02:41:45.524]  Well, thank you, Rachel.
[02:41:45.544 --> 02:41:46.344]  Let me just be clear.
[02:41:47.665 --> 02:41:48.646]  I've had guests on.
[02:41:50.191 --> 02:41:54.234]  And sponsors on, that think, that said a year ago we were going to run out of food.
[02:41:54.855 --> 02:41:57.357]  And now some stuff's running out and I hope they're wrong, okay?
[02:42:01.601 --> 02:42:06.725]  Believe me, I'm not sitting... People email me and accuse me of wanting all this to happen so I can be right.
[02:42:07.606 --> 02:42:08.466]  This is scary!
[02:42:09.547 --> 02:42:10.388]  I live here too!
[02:42:12.109 --> 02:42:13.491]  I don't want any of this to be true.
[02:42:14.351 --> 02:42:17.414]  But there's a very good chance we're going to have a war in the streets, depression.
[02:42:18.351 --> 02:42:19.872]  That's the fundamentals of the economics.
[02:42:20.252 --> 02:42:24.455]  If it's some long, horrible recession, I'm going to be happy as a pig in the mud.
[02:42:27.997 --> 02:42:29.258]  Talk about a lesser of two evils.
[02:42:29.298 --> 02:42:30.639]  That's one I'll take.
[02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:35.982]  But yeah, there's all sorts of food shortages starting up.
[02:42:37.263 --> 02:42:39.744]  You wait until the people find out they've had their dollar devalued.
[02:42:40.084 --> 02:42:42.606]  And now the Federal Reserve is going to take over all the regulatory agencies?
[02:42:42.666 --> 02:42:43.406]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:42:44.007 --> 02:42:45.888]  We're about 15... Oh, you're still there?
[02:42:45.908 --> 02:42:46.108]  Go ahead.
[02:42:46.690 --> 02:42:48.570]  And Goldman Sachs is down the tank, too.
[02:42:49.271 --> 02:42:51.771]  And my folks used to take and invest with all this stuff.
[02:42:51.791 --> 02:42:54.092]  If they were alive today, they'd be flipped out.
[02:42:54.792 --> 02:42:55.932]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:42:56.032 --> 02:42:56.632]  One last call.
[02:42:57.073 --> 02:42:58.693]  Aaron in California.
[02:42:58.853 --> 02:42:59.273]  Go ahead.
[02:42:59.293 --> 02:43:01.394]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:43:01.554 --> 02:43:01.834]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:02.674 --> 02:43:03.094]  How are you?
[02:43:03.414 --> 02:43:03.654]  Good.
[02:43:04.554 --> 02:43:12.416]  I've been listening to you since, I'd say, the late 90s, and I've been finding out a lot about the government through my dad's sources.
[02:43:12.456 --> 02:43:14.097]  He's kind of an entertainment guy in L.A.
[02:43:15.689 --> 02:43:22.953]  I'm just completely disgusted with this entire country, but to start off simple, what kind of water is safe to drink if I don't have the filter?
[02:43:24.474 --> 02:43:35.419]  Well, most filters just cut out some of the dead bacteria, some of the larger molecules, some of the herbicides, pesticides, things like sodium fluoride and other things go right through it.
[02:43:36.040 --> 02:43:38.361]  Even with a high quality, I personally like
[02:43:39.053 --> 02:43:41.554]  I gotta say, I like the British Berkey, the Berkey folks sell.
[02:43:41.674 --> 02:43:42.655]  They're the national distributor.
[02:43:42.675 --> 02:43:44.256]  The black one's good too, but I've had it for years.
[02:43:44.276 --> 02:43:45.096]  Those are portable, right?
[02:43:45.116 --> 02:43:46.397]  You can take, you have portable ones, right?
[02:43:46.437 --> 02:43:52.420]  Yeah, but yes, but you gotta add a fluoride filter to it, and then it only gets like 98% out.
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:56.402]  I mean, fluoride is one of the smallest, hardest to filter particles.
[02:43:57.582 --> 02:43:58.543]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:44:00.731 --> 02:44:02.972]  Well, as far as bottled water, what's good?
[02:44:03.032 --> 02:44:04.612]  I mean, there's no bottled water.
[02:44:04.632 --> 02:44:12.794]  There are reverse osmosis, and then I've talked to water experts who even work for companies, they say even better is the distilled.
[02:44:13.835 --> 02:44:16.475]  There's companies you can get where they ship it to you, the big bottles.
[02:44:20.382 --> 02:44:26.506]  You know, I tend to not even care about myself, so I still drink tea and stuff that's got fluoride in it, because I'm habitualized to slavery.
[02:44:26.866 --> 02:44:31.950]  But with my children, I'm more neurotic about it, and we take bottles of water places, and by bottles, it's bottles of...
[02:44:33.368 --> 02:44:35.289]  Reverse osmosis put through a Berkey.
[02:44:35.770 --> 02:44:36.871]  You know, we do things like that.
[02:44:37.291 --> 02:44:38.872]  Then we cook with reverse osmosis.
[02:44:39.352 --> 02:44:43.575]  Because the fluoride has a bigger effect on their growing brains.
[02:44:43.975 --> 02:44:44.476]  Got to jump.
[02:44:44.516 --> 02:44:45.176]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:45.717 --> 02:44:46.257]  Call me back.
[02:44:46.417 --> 02:44:48.759]  Your calls are all so great, and I want to hear from you more.
[02:44:48.779 --> 02:44:52.621]  I just want to have time to cover this news and wrap up the last 15 minutes.
[02:44:53.922 --> 02:44:57.525]  Don't forget, we have a big announcement coming up Monday.
[02:44:58.579 --> 02:45:00.320]  That's in about four and a half days.
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:03.862]  Huge announcement about this radio show and my work and what I do.
[02:45:05.403 --> 02:45:09.766]  The biggest change in about 11 years of my radio career.
[02:45:09.866 --> 02:45:10.867]  It's coming up Monday.
[02:45:12.147 --> 02:45:13.708]  And I'll just tell you it has to do with that.
[02:45:13.948 --> 02:45:16.090]  And that'll be announced at the start of the second hour.
[02:45:16.690 --> 02:45:18.071]  Coming up next Monday.
[02:45:18.811 --> 02:45:22.934]  So I do want to have everybody tune in for that on Monday.
[02:45:24.915 --> 02:45:26.976]  Other big guests coming up this month as well.
[02:45:27.016 --> 02:45:28.037]  I'll just let you know that.
[02:45:28.971 --> 02:45:41.159]  And in the next few months, you're just a ginormous guest, because some of them are working on movies right now and doing some other things, but you wouldn't believe who I've got this close to coming on the show.
[02:45:41.179 --> 02:45:41.919]  And I'm not pushing them.
[02:45:42.039 --> 02:45:42.940]  I'm not going to push people.
[02:45:45.242 --> 02:45:46.722]  Huge Hollywood star.
[02:45:46.763 --> 02:45:48.824]  I mean, we're talking top three contacted me.
[02:45:49.604 --> 02:45:53.187]  Turns out I know the top three or four Hollywood people.
[02:45:54.708 --> 02:45:55.928]  It's just crazy.
[02:45:55.948 --> 02:45:56.629]  Who would ever know?
[02:45:57.273 --> 02:45:59.914]  I mean, I better do a better job on this show, everybody that's listening to it.
[02:46:02.055 --> 02:46:06.896]  I never saw myself as a trendy or cutting-edge person, but this show is about as cutting-edge as it gets.
[02:46:07.557 --> 02:46:08.377]  Because we don't care.
[02:46:08.557 --> 02:46:09.837]  You know, it's not about being cool.
[02:46:09.897 --> 02:46:11.318]  It's not about anything.
[02:46:11.378 --> 02:46:12.338]  It's just about being real.
[02:46:13.499 --> 02:46:16.920]  But just mega massive guest coming up.
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:18.440]  Okay.
[02:46:20.201 --> 02:46:22.522]  Here is some of the other
[02:46:25.797 --> 02:46:28.739]  News that I didn't really get to today that we'll just briefly mention.
[02:46:28.759 --> 02:46:40.807]  Because in the final segment I'm going to play just three minutes of Jesse Ventura, part of him getting a $9.11 million inside job, and then the show ends and it restarts at InfoWars.com.
[02:46:41.327 --> 02:46:45.510]  The Ventura clip is not on YouTube, not on Google yet, not mp3'd yet, not up yet.
[02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:52.835]  The one place to hear it, it'll be everywhere in a few hours, will be at InfoWars.com the first hour and then 20 minutes of the next hour.
[02:46:55.251 --> 02:47:02.915]  Okay, I'm going to cover more of this tomorrow, because this gets into the whole us-destroying-ourselves situation.
[02:47:03.595 --> 02:47:08.557]  We have created human-animal embryos already, says British team, Times of London.
[02:47:08.857 --> 02:47:09.838]  I saw this ten years ago.
[02:47:09.858 --> 02:47:11.299]  They're just now announcing it to the slaves.
[02:47:11.519 --> 02:47:12.559]  Hey, why are we having a debate?
[02:47:12.579 --> 02:47:13.340]  We did this years ago.
[02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:18.102]  Sinners tap into personal databases.
[02:47:18.866 --> 02:47:22.669]  Says the government just taps into all private data, basically, without warrants.
[02:47:23.129 --> 02:47:24.130]  That's the Washington Post.
[02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:26.892]  ACLU military skirting law to spy.
[02:47:27.172 --> 02:47:28.833]  Says the military looks at your bank account.
[02:47:28.853 --> 02:47:30.334]  Well, they're all hooked into it.
[02:47:30.835 --> 02:47:31.255]  No warrant.
[02:47:31.275 --> 02:47:32.636]  They just type in and see what you're doing.
[02:47:35.278 --> 02:47:37.259]  Oil chiefs say high price is not their fault.
[02:47:37.319 --> 02:47:38.400]  That's actually true.
[02:47:40.502 --> 02:47:41.883]  It's the dollar being devalued.
[02:47:41.923 --> 02:47:43.244]  That's why you're paying so much.
[02:47:45.009 --> 02:47:47.671]  It's kind of like they're saying food prices are up because we've kicked illegals out.
[02:47:47.891 --> 02:47:48.891]  There's record illegals.
[02:47:49.131 --> 02:47:50.932]  The food prices are up because of shortages.
[02:47:52.273 --> 02:47:56.376]  80% of the country, 80% of the goods you get, including produce, comes from trucks.
[02:47:57.796 --> 02:47:58.937]  In fact, even more with trucks.
[02:47:59.637 --> 02:48:03.179]  I just saw the statistic yesterday that 80% of all goods are trucked.
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:03.179]  80%.
[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:07.662]  More of that, because I'm already digressing, it doesn't matter.
[02:48:10.177 --> 02:48:16.220]  Botox may move from face to brain studies and rats showed Bloomberg News major scientific studies.
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:17.701]  Yeah, it's deadly poison folks.
[02:48:17.741 --> 02:48:29.026]  Don't take it Before I come back and play this Ventura clip, I do want to tell you about some amazing Sponsors who we wouldn't have this show if it wasn't for them.
[02:48:29.546 --> 02:48:31.607]  One of them of course is e foods direct and
[02:48:32.409 --> 02:48:33.571]  The J. Michael Stevens Group.

[02:48:39.859 --> 02:48:41.701]  The least expensive for the quality you get.

[02:49:24.976 --> 02:49:25.836]  None of the quack stuff.
[02:49:26.277 --> 02:49:31.360]  Like Super Beta Prostate, a combination of well-known herbs to shrink the prostate to give it health.
[02:49:31.981 --> 02:49:33.322]  A lot of research on this.
[02:49:33.342 --> 02:49:33.402]  1-800-569-4056.

[02:50:30.707 --> 02:50:34.410]  Final segment straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:35.359 --> 02:50:42.483]  We'll be right back and we will launch into just the very end of Jesse Ventura where he started talking about 9-11.
[02:50:42.563 --> 02:50:45.464]  And then we're going to come back and air the whole interview when the show restarts.
[02:50:45.924 --> 02:50:49.046]  And that's only in about 8 minutes at InfoWars.com on the web.
[02:50:49.466 --> 02:50:50.847]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:50.867 --> 02:50:52.968]  A new world order.
[02:50:53.688 --> 02:50:54.589]  In the near future.
[02:50:55.518 --> 02:50:58.141]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:58.581 --> 02:51:00.343]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:51:01.404 --> 02:51:03.586]  Put their objective be world domination.
[02:51:04.207 --> 02:51:06.629]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:14.717]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.725 --> 02:51:22.668]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:23.189 --> 02:51:27.111]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:48.305 --> 02:51:55.071]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[02:51:55.091 --> 02:52:07.121]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones, with many more nutrients found in this incredible food source that the government does not want you to have.
[02:52:07.401 --> 02:52:12.445]  This product is available in powder, seeds, and oil, and is shipped free to your door in the U.S.

[02:52:16.488 --> 02:52:18.709]  Don't waste time thinking about storing food.
[02:52:18.909 --> 02:52:23.691]  Plan ahead and prepare for yourself and your family now, and be in control of your destiny.
[02:52:23.951 --> 02:52:28.133]  You can save and invest your money, but in the end, food will be your greatest asset.
[02:52:28.413 --> 02:52:31.655]  Remember what the Word of God says in Ezekiel 719.

[02:52:37.357 --> 02:52:39.558]  Remember, food will be your greatest asset.

[02:52:40.058 --> 02:52:41.761]  This product does not contain THC.

[02:52:50.565 --> 02:52:52.606]  of the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:52:52.986 --> 02:52:55.968]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:52:56.008 --> 02:52:56.708]  is a real thing.
[02:52:56.768 --> 02:53:03.672]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never-before-available garlic.
[02:53:03.792 --> 02:53:14.678]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, and Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[02:53:14.798 --> 02:53:18.040]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of
[02:53:18.220 --> 02:53:23.462]  Disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.

[02:53:39.569 --> 02:53:43.150]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:53:51.881 --> 02:53:53.462]  Alright, it's the final segment.
[02:53:53.782 --> 02:53:56.084]  Huge news-making interview with Jesse Ventura.
[02:53:56.104 --> 02:53:58.906]  He came out and said he thinks they'll probably assassinate a Barack Obama.
[02:53:59.226 --> 02:54:02.108]  He went totally public and said he believes 9-11's a total inside job.
[02:54:02.508 --> 02:54:05.570]  Not just that Bin Laden was involved, but the government was involved.
[02:54:05.610 --> 02:54:07.671]  Now he just says the government did it, he's researched it.
[02:54:08.352 --> 02:54:14.156]  He also talked about how he was censored by MSNBC and how his book was censored by 20-plus publishers.
[02:54:14.876 --> 02:54:17.017]  He was on at the very start of the show.
[02:54:17.057 --> 02:54:17.578]  He came in hot.
[02:54:18.917 --> 02:54:21.318]  We call that coming in hot in radio.
[02:54:21.338 --> 02:54:22.539]  It's a military term.
[02:54:22.579 --> 02:54:24.460]  I mean, just coming in with your big S immediately.
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:29.622]  We're going to play like three minutes here at the end of some of his 9-11 comments.
[02:54:29.642 --> 02:54:30.443]  He said a lot more.
[02:54:30.463 --> 02:54:31.663]  He talked about it for 15 minutes.
[02:54:32.464 --> 02:54:33.764]  That is coming up right now.
[02:54:33.784 --> 02:54:36.365]  We're going to play a few minutes from the interview, then the show's going to end.
[02:54:36.706 --> 02:54:39.507]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com to those streams.
[02:54:40.307 --> 02:54:43.789]  We've got to go to Infowars.com where we re-stream, re-loop the show.
[02:54:43.809 --> 02:54:46.210]  And then there'll be articles by Paul Watson and Curt Nemo.
[02:54:46.410 --> 02:54:47.430]  Get them out to everybody.
[02:54:47.630 --> 02:54:48.531]  They're up there right now.
[02:54:48.611 --> 02:54:49.291]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:49.311 --> 02:54:49.991]  God bless you all.
[02:54:50.531 --> 02:54:52.072]  Governor Ventura, you've got the floor.
[02:54:52.112 --> 02:54:53.433]  Give us your take on 9-11.
[02:54:54.625 --> 02:54:56.766]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me state this.
[02:54:56.806 --> 02:55:08.373]  You know, being ex-military, when the attack initially took place and I was governor, I went on a very focused tunnel vision mode that our country had been attacked and what the hell do we need to do to repel it?
[02:55:08.433 --> 02:55:17.458]  So, I today kicked myself because at that point in time I had a position of power and if I would have, you know, not been
[02:55:18.098 --> 02:55:36.535]  The way I was, the way all of us were so shocked when it happened, that in that position of power I could have raised a lot more questions at that time about the things that went down that day, and where today when I raise those questions naturally it doesn't quite have the impact that it would have had back then.
[02:55:37.336 --> 02:55:42.080]  But to me it's questions that are not being answered and haven't been answered about 9-11.
[02:55:43.401 --> 02:55:52.765]  And, you know, first and foremost, I think, is the fact that, okay, in New York City and Manhattan, two planes struck two buildings.
[02:55:53.305 --> 02:55:55.346]  We'll all be in agreement on that, I think.
[02:55:56.086 --> 02:55:59.728]  But how is it that a third building fell five hours later?
[02:56:00.348 --> 02:56:03.209]  You know what they call World Trade Center Building No.
[02:56:03.710 --> 02:56:03.209]  7?
[02:56:04.250 --> 02:56:20.318]  And for people that think, well, it was just a smaller building, it was 51 stories high, which of course in Manhattan probably isn't that big of a building, but if you were to move that building to Austin, Texas, or to Minneapolis, Minnesota, it would be a huge building.
[02:56:20.398 --> 02:56:24.700]  How could this building just implode into its own footprint five hours later?
[02:56:25.300 --> 02:56:26.622]  That's my first question.
[02:56:26.662 --> 02:56:29.927]  The 9-11 Commission never even brought it up.
[02:56:30.027 --> 02:56:35.075]  They didn't devote even one page to that in their big volume of investigation.
[02:56:35.716 --> 02:56:40.904]  Number two, how could those buildings fall at the speed of gravity?
[02:56:41.994 --> 02:56:48.522]  You know, if you put a stopwatch on them, both of those World Trade Center buildings were on the ground in 10 seconds.
[02:56:49.263 --> 02:56:50.104]  How can that be?
[02:56:50.124 --> 02:56:57.453]  If you took a billiard ball and dropped it from the height of the World Trade Center in a vacuum, it would hit the ground in 9.3 seconds.
[02:56:58.955 --> 02:56:59.296]  Amazing.
[02:57:19.515 --> 02:57:25.658]  And yet they're telling us that, and I could go on now after studying it, the planes hit the building.
[02:57:25.758 --> 02:57:26.158]  Okay.
[02:57:27.299 --> 02:57:32.741]  Jet fuel is four-fifths kerosene, which is not a hot burning fuel.
[02:57:33.122 --> 02:57:41.105]  And they want us to believe that it melted these steel-structured girders and caused these buildings to pancake-collapse to the ground?
[02:57:41.606 --> 02:57:46.208]  I was on the site within two weeks after it happened and I saw none of these pancakes.
[02:57:46.608 --> 02:57:52.289]  Wouldn't they all be piled up in a huge mass on the ground, and yet everything was blown into dust?
[02:57:53.729 --> 02:57:54.469]  Aerosolized.
[02:57:55.490 --> 02:58:00.811]  You know, and when you look at it from that aspect, none of it makes any sense.
[02:58:00.891 --> 02:58:05.291]  If you apply common sense again to it, it does not make any sense.
[02:58:05.351 --> 02:58:11.953]  Never before in the annals of history has a fire caused a steel-structured building to fall to the ground.
[02:58:11.973 --> 02:58:13.533]  Governor Ventura?
[02:58:15.428 --> 02:58:16.969]  As the way, yeah, three of them did.
[02:58:17.069 --> 02:58:18.711]  Governor Ventura, stay with us.
[02:58:18.731 --> 02:58:19.191]  70-second break.
[02:58:19.231 --> 02:58:20.453]  We're coming right back to you.
[02:58:20.713 --> 02:58:21.434]  Coming in hot.
[02:58:22.435 --> 02:58:26.599]  And as an underwater demolitions expert, I want to get your take on explosives.
[02:58:26.619 --> 02:58:27.280]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:30.583 --> 02:58:32.445]  You are listening to GCN.
