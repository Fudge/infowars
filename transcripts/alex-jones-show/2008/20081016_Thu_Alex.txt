[00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:16.852]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:26.454]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which by any decent standard they ought not to enjoy.
[00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:28.794]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:34.399]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:39.926]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:46.214]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:48.697]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:51.301]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:59.397]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:06.579]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:11.680]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.580]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.781]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under a specific condition.
[00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.842]  We have to work with dark side over there and spend time in the shadows.
[00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:27.073]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:27.973]  Well, join me.
[00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.634]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:32.694]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:01:34.254 --> 00:01:40.876]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:47.337]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:50.918]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:08.566]  Okay, here in just a few minutes we'll be talking to Sheriff Raymond Franks, former Travis County Sheriff, running for Sheriff.
[00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:17.454]  Then we have Red Beckman joining us coming on the show to talk about how important it is to have good peace officers and good sheriffs.
[00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:22.138]  And then of course, Officer Jack McClam joining us coming up in about 15 minutes from now.
[00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:23.619]  I wanted to finish up now.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.121]  With Jason Burmess on Zeitgeist Addendum.
[00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:31.902]  You know, in closing, Jason, just everything about it is bad.
[00:02:32.222 --> 00:02:35.823]  They mix in that the Federal Reserve is bad, and they say they have a new world order that's going to be great.
[00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:47.827]  It's total theosophic society, the UN religion, the UN Christ is in it, they're talking about the God Spirit in us, and then telling us that we're just religious.
[00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:51.488]  Well, we're not even talking about religion, because they are religiously obsessed
[00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:53.188]  with this new man.
[00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:59.211]  This is straight-up Albert Pike and we need to expose this because this is aggressive towards us.
[00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:04.093]  I notice the whole movement is aggressive but then always acts like if you criticize it that you don't even count.
[00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:05.514]  You're just an intellectual idiot.
[00:03:05.914 --> 00:03:06.414]  Shut up!
[00:03:07.075 --> 00:03:08.715]  So just classic New World Order tactics.
[00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:09.356]  Jason Bermas?
[00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:15.658]  Yeah, they also discuss how every civilization before the one that is created won't even be in the history books.
[00:03:15.678 --> 00:03:21.401]  It'll be pretty much eviscerated and we'll just talk about how there were big land grabs and people took stuff from other people.
[00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:23.653]  Well, that's pretty horrifying to me.
[00:03:24.013 --> 00:03:32.277]  I'd like to think that the story of the human spirit is going to live on for generations to come, especially after we defeat these globalists, Alex.
[00:03:34.678 --> 00:03:35.559]  Well, absolutely.
[00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:42.782]  Everything is a process, and anybody that tells you that there's this utopia and the withering away of the state and we're going to re-educate people, look out!
[00:03:44.588 --> 00:03:48.173]  The public, a lot of people are getting suckered by this, but I'm going to have to counter it.
[00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:54.281]  And then they never counter me on any of my facts, like, well, why is this guy, you know, the UN Christ?
[00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:56.724]  I mean, why is he talking about God, God's spirit?
[00:03:57.245 --> 00:04:00.168]  You know, I'm not even bringing up religious systems, you are.
[00:04:00.188 --> 00:04:02.591]  And they just, you know, say, shut up!
[00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:04.613]  You know, you're not even allowed to comment.
[00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:08.176]  I mean, I just go back to that, and they say, you're just jealous of it.
[00:04:08.237 --> 00:04:10.198]  No, I've never even really watched it until now.
[00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:11.760]  I'm not paying attention.
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.541]  I have everybody on to build everybody up.
[00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:22.709]  I mean, they try every intellectual dishonest trick, the people that are trying to counter us, when I'm just saying, hey man, this is the New World Order group.
[00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:24.531]  This is the Theosophic group.
[00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:28.014]  They have the Christ of the Theosophic Group in their film.
[00:04:28.054 --> 00:04:29.615]  That's what they're saying.
[00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:33.699]  This has always been that New World Order, technocratic religion.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.323]  You know, where they set up communism and then dangle pictures of high-tech cities in front of you.
[00:04:38.343 --> 00:04:40.385]  I mean, that's the old trick a hundred years ago.
[00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:46.971]  And they're doing the same trick again, and I'm just going, I'm not, you know, I'm going, my God, I know history, I've seen this a million times.
[00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:49.093]  They're like, no, it's new, it's revolutionary.
[00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:50.354]  You can't even grasp it.
[00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:58.133]  And, you know, a man is going to quit wanting his neighbor's wife, and people aren't going to want bigger, better houses.
[00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.954]  I said, well, can I have a house in this future system?
[00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:03.016]  And he goes, you will have a place where you can go to for privacy.
[00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:05.098]  Well, will I be able to have a gun?
[00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.759]  Well, I don't see why you're going to need a gun.
[00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.201]  You know, there's going to be all this great peace.
[00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:12.603]  And then everything will be according to the load of the earth.
[00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:13.764]  Well, who's going to decide that?
[00:05:14.044 --> 00:05:15.666]  And that's all the theosophic system.
[00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:18.668]  Man, I tell you, Burmese, this is amazing.
[00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:23.009]  Yeah, you know, I was very wary with the original releases.
[00:05:23.109 --> 00:05:26.690]  I thought it was, you know, well-produced, excellently done.
[00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.551]  I had a lot of questions.
[00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:31.213]  I actually interviewed Peter Joseph probably two and a half years ago.
[00:05:31.913 --> 00:05:43.019]  And, you know, looking back on it, if you check it out on YouTube, when I asked him, well, how do you feel about people interpreting this as kind of new-agey and futuristic and kind of one-worldy, he got very defensive on that.
[00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.120]  He was like, well, what's wrong with that?
[00:05:45.854 --> 00:05:53.306]  You know, I countered it by saying, well, a lot of the proponents of that don't seem to have this great utopian vision for the common man.
[00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:59.996]  It seems like that utopian vision is for the upper echelon, while the rest of us are pretty much drugged and enslaved, Alex.
[00:06:00.617 --> 00:06:00.858]  I mean...
[00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:03.899]  No, no, that's the key, what you just hit on.
[00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.843]  This zeitgeist Illuminati view is for the general slaves.
[00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:09.784]  You won't work anymore.
[00:06:09.824 --> 00:06:10.905]  It's going to be heavenly.
[00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:12.306]  The machines will run it all.
[00:06:12.647 --> 00:06:16.010]  That's always what they've put out to the general public the last 150 years.
[00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.172]  But for the elite and their real UN policy documents...
[00:06:19.853 --> 00:06:44.562]  The Theosophic Society gets exterminating the majority of us, and Alice Bailey, and then after that, Barbara Marks Hubbard, saying, you know, we're the pale horse death, we're going to slaughter the majority of people, every Christian must be killed, because their backward system keeps the consciousness from rising, and keeps, and so, I'm like having him on, you know, with a secular show going, well, you know, what about this and that?
[00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:45.622]  Oh, you're Christianity!
[00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:47.243]  Well, I'm not talking about Christianity.
[00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:47.883]  Christians!
[00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:48.424]  Christians!
[00:06:48.464 --> 00:06:48.864]  Christians!
[00:06:49.064 --> 00:06:50.125]  And other religious people!
[00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:50.825]  It's all made up!
[00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:51.606]  It's not science!
[00:06:51.826 --> 00:06:53.967]  Meanwhile, did you hear about the Theosophic Society?
[00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:54.528]  Christ!
[00:06:54.948 --> 00:06:56.209]  And the wonderfulness that's coming!
[00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.311]  You know, and I'm like, I mean, this is cult land!
[00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.052]  I mean, that's what this is!
[00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:13.640]  Yeah, and I gotta say, Alex, you know, like you stated before, I'm not the most religious guy out there, but you have to give some kind of credence to religion when the upper echelon are out there doing pagan rituals in the woods of
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.142]  California and Sonoma for two weeks out of the year.
[00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:25.989]  But more than that, the locals protested me in a bunch of newspapers and the Sonoma Free Press and the rest of it because I covered the rituals.
[00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.652]  They got real mad about that and then we showed up and they were doing rituals.
[00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:33.215]  The very, the point is, they always claim they're atheists.
[00:07:33.255 --> 00:07:40.141]  That's their cover to discredit the existing system because they have to get rid of the old before they bring in the new that is really the ancient.
[00:07:41.687 --> 00:07:47.115]  I'm with you, Alex, and thank God for people like yourself that continue to expose this system.
[00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:48.457]  I do what I can.
[00:07:48.497 --> 00:07:53.804]  I was on a radio show this morning talking about One World Government, the New World Order, the election.
[00:07:53.824 --> 00:07:58.070]  But yeah, this Zeitgeist Addendum, I'm hoping it won't take off as big as Zeitgeist.
[00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.751]  We are giving it
[00:07:59.153 --> 00:08:03.334]  A lot of press, but that's because, you know, a lot of people are coming to us with this stuff.
[00:08:03.354 --> 00:08:04.494]  You know, we're getting emails.
[00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:05.255]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:05.955]  Exactly.
[00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:08.256]  I mean, people said, hey, what do you think of this?
[00:08:08.316 --> 00:08:11.036]  And I went and watched it, and you told me you were worried about it.
[00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:13.957]  And I went and said, man, I've seen this a hundred times.
[00:08:13.977 --> 00:08:15.017]  This is pure New World Order.
[00:08:15.297 --> 00:08:17.178]  This is their highest level system.
[00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:19.859]  This is what they push, always, for over a hundred years.
[00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:23.960]  And then I got the guy on, and he just kind of dissed me.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.682]  When I talked about genetics having a big effect, you know, on any point, or on certain breeds of cow being more aggressive, he said, no, they're not.
[00:08:31.242 --> 00:08:33.163]  And I'm like, and he goes, science, science!
[00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:34.023]  You don't have science!
[00:08:34.043 --> 00:08:35.744]  And I'm like, I'm talking about science.
[00:08:36.484 --> 00:08:40.786]  Here, I mean, you know, well, that's not, you know, I mean, it's, what they're doing is religious.
[00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:42.826]  What they're doing is a religion.
[00:08:43.887 --> 00:08:46.508]  It's the religion of the one world Christ, world government state.
[00:08:46.848 --> 00:08:48.308]  Jason Burmas, thanks for being on with us.
[00:08:49.169 --> 00:08:49.609]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:51.921]  Yeah, you bet.
[00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:56.163]  I mentioned this a few weeks ago because I saw it and was kind of worried about it, but then I thought, oh, these are good guys.
[00:08:56.183 --> 00:08:57.943]  They just mean well, kind of new-agey.
[00:08:59.564 --> 00:09:04.005]  And then I researched it more and I was like, whoa!
[00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:05.506]  Whoa!
[00:09:05.606 --> 00:09:07.706]  This is the top echelon stuff.
[00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:10.947]  I mean, this is the world Christ.
[00:09:10.987 --> 00:09:12.188]  This is the world government.
[00:09:13.444 --> 00:09:16.805]  And man, now I'm like, whoa!
[00:09:17.426 --> 00:09:18.706]  I mean, this is serious.
[00:09:18.986 --> 00:09:21.307]  I should have countered this years ago.
[00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:22.467]  But I tried to play nice.
[00:09:22.487 --> 00:09:24.008]  Well, see, they don't want to play nice, folks.
[00:09:24.628 --> 00:09:26.549]  It's all about how they're high up and you're low down.
[00:09:26.609 --> 00:09:27.349]  It's a mind trick.
[00:09:27.369 --> 00:09:29.550]  Apparently it's a bunch of bull they're putting out.
[00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:35.704]  Raymond Frank, 2008 Republican candidate for Travis County Sheriff.
[00:09:36.104 --> 00:09:38.265]  Website's RaymondFrank.com.
[00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:42.848]  And he will decriminalize marijuana.
[00:09:43.388 --> 00:09:44.829]  He will ban taser use.
[00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:54.453]  He doesn't like to talk about himself, but he's had more combat hours and more hours than anybody else ever.
[00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:58.831]  In his area, the military.
[00:09:58.851 --> 00:10:05.121]  Instead of going over this giant bio, you're also the head of an investigative unit in the military, and again, former Travis County.
[00:10:07.364 --> 00:10:10.966]  Sheriff, now running for Sheriff again, Special Agent, Lieutenant Colonel with the U.S.
[00:10:11.026 --> 00:10:23.754]  Air Force, Special Investigations for 15 years, assignment in Berlin, Paris, London, Weizenbaden, on and on and on, Iceland, South, Central Texas, everywhere, and he was Travis County Sheriff for eight years.
[00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:31.059]  He holds the Air Force's highest aeronautical rating of Command Pilot with 3,600 hours, and we really appreciate
[00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:39.041]  You coming on with us, and we've got some folks, some of your colleagues who are supporting you coming on later in the show, Red Beckman and Jack McClam.
[00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:42.002]  But it is great to have you here with us in studio, Sheriff.
[00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:44.603]  Glad to be on your show, Alex.
[00:10:44.743 --> 00:10:46.784]  It's a real privilege.
[00:10:47.084 --> 00:10:49.425]  Tell us a little bit about yourself that I didn't get into in the bio.
[00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:55.727]  Well, I spent 26 and a half years in the military service, and you pretty well covered what I did there.
[00:10:56.687 --> 00:10:58.288]  I came back and
[00:10:59.845 --> 00:11:04.069]  In 1970, and in 1972, I decided to run for sheriff.
[00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:09.673]  That was the first year that 18-year-olds voted, and I was running against a good sheriff.
[00:11:11.054 --> 00:11:14.537]  He'd been in office 20 years, and I was successful in defeating him.
[00:11:15.598 --> 00:11:21.723]  Served four years, was re-elected four years, then I was defeated by a local police officer, Sheriff Dorian Bailey.
[00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:34.559]  So, but I've seen a lot of things that, some good things have happened since then, but there's a lot of things that I don't like, and I want to do something about it, so that's why I'm running for sheriff.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.806]  Alright, we're going to break, but we're going to have you with us at least a half hour in the next hour, so an hour plus.
[00:11:40.607 --> 00:11:49.294]  With you today, sir, and we'll talk about what you would do as Sheriff in Travis County and how we need other people like himself to run for Sheriff in other areas and how important the office of the Sheriff is.
[00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:55.179]  And we are seeing some other police chiefs and sheriffs now restrict or ban tasers, some of the things you're calling for.
[00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:59.242]  So we'll be discussing that all when we get back on the other side.
[00:12:03.197 --> 00:12:09.560]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.921]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:12:12.582 --> 00:12:13.622]  But who is the enemy?
[00:12:14.123 --> 00:12:14.663]  Bin Laden.
[00:12:14.923 --> 00:12:15.743]  This is his ammo.
[00:12:15.763 --> 00:12:17.224]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:12:17.304 --> 00:12:19.005]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:12:19.285 --> 00:12:26.049]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.869]  Some U.S.
[00:12:26.909 --> 00:12:32.572]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:12:33.272 --> 00:12:36.755]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:12:36.775 --> 00:12:38.916]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:09.197]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:13:09.657 --> 00:13:17.419]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:23.361]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:25.643]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:13:25.943 --> 00:13:30.707]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:35.750]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:13:36.251 --> 00:13:40.114]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:13:40.614 --> 00:13:41.635]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:53.644]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:13:56.106 --> 00:13:59.448]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:22.242]  Ionic Zone Shock Treatment Ozone Generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of second-hand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[00:14:22.462 --> 00:14:25.703]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[00:14:26.004 --> 00:14:30.486]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[00:14:30.766 --> 00:14:32.648]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[00:14:32.848 --> 00:14:36.111]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:43.037]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:50.184]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators by going to ioniczone.com or calling 800-549-9535.

[00:15:02.332 --> 00:15:03.672]  Cameras are everywhere.
[00:15:03.952 --> 00:15:11.975]  Above stoplights, on toll booths, and scanning the freeways just waiting to snap a photo of your license plate, only to slam you with ridiculous fines.
[00:15:12.335 --> 00:15:15.616]  In California, red light tickets are as high as $400.

[00:15:51.946 --> 00:15:52.347]  That's 800-276-9601 today.
[00:15:52.407 --> 00:15:53.789]  Don't give your money to the state.
[00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:54.670]  Spray your plate!
[00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:30.563]  Okay, Sheriff Raymond Franks, tell us why you're running for Sheriff and what you're going to do and change here in Travis County if you get elected.
[00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:37.203]  Well, the main reason I'm running for sheriff because he's so extravagant in his budget.
[00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:42.824]  And I call it predatory projections that he makes in his budget.
[00:16:43.464 --> 00:16:49.586]  And this in turn provided him access to more money and personnel from the county commissioners.
[00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:56.628]  For instance, he says he'll get 249 tickets a day to meet his yearly projection.
[00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.768]  249 tickets a day, that's a lot of tickets.
[00:16:59.128 --> 00:17:00.729]  You know how long it takes to ride a ticket.
[00:17:01.857 --> 00:17:05.741]  During that same time, he'll work 22 accidents a day.
[00:17:06.302 --> 00:17:08.845]  That takes at least an hour, tying up two units.
[00:17:09.505 --> 00:17:13.309]  Then the big thing is calls for service.
[00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:19.336]  360 calls for service for 24 hours a day to meet his yearly projection.
[00:17:19.916 --> 00:17:22.519]  And that's why I'm calling them predatory projections.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:27.726]  Well, bottom line, in the past, if a car got robbed or a house got broke into, the police or sheriffs would show up.
[00:17:28.086 --> 00:17:30.809]  Now, all over the country, they're saying, we're just not going to show up most of the time.
[00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.672]  We're too busy writing tickets.
[00:17:33.188 --> 00:17:34.289]  That's exactly right.
[00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:39.612]  And they have in their budget right now over $200,000 in performance pay.
[00:17:40.233 --> 00:17:51.180]  And what that is, is it goes for people to do an outstanding job writing tickets, but there's still a lot of that money appropriated in the corrections area, so I don't know exactly how that's distributed.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.620]  What would you do with illegal aliens?
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.161]  Because, you know, this is a sanctuary city and county, and they're above citizens.
[00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:00.242]  They get to drink and drive, not have ID, not have insurance.
[00:18:00.562 --> 00:18:05.903]  A citizen literally just gets clobbered if they have a crooked toenail, but illegal aliens can do whatever they want.
[00:18:06.183 --> 00:18:12.644]  Well, for immigrants that do not have documents, I don't know what I'd do.
[00:18:12.904 --> 00:18:17.024]  I mean, you know, if they're put in jail by people, we're not going to look for them.
[00:18:17.905 --> 00:18:20.005]  My department's not going to look for them, but if we will
[00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:25.134]  I understand all that, but I mean, why do I get arrested if I don't have an ID, but a lawyer doesn't?
[00:18:44.702 --> 00:18:45.183]  I don't know.
[00:18:46.744 --> 00:18:49.286]  I will fight against it whenever I have a chance.
[00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:53.290]  I mean, I'd be glad to let them drive without a license or insurance.
[00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:54.291]  I think it's a free market.
[00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:55.251]  Sue somebody if they hurt you.
[00:18:55.272 --> 00:18:57.353]  The point is, I'm tired of all this socialism.
[00:18:57.654 --> 00:19:00.276]  The point is, I don't like illegal aliens having more rights than I do.
[00:19:00.836 --> 00:19:01.797]  Well, that's not right.
[00:19:01.817 --> 00:19:02.738]  I know they do.
[00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:05.160]  And it should change.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.803]  A lot of those undocumented aliens are going back to Mexico.
[00:19:09.264 --> 00:19:09.504]  Yeah.
[00:19:09.784 --> 00:19:11.506]  Because they can't make a living here anymore.
[00:19:12.574 --> 00:19:15.017]  That's right, the globalist doesn't suck the country dry.
[00:19:15.317 --> 00:19:17.739]  Sheriff, you talk about decriminalizing marijuana.
[00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:18.340]  Tell us about that.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:31.874]  Yeah, well, right now, the class B misdemeanor, two ounces or more, it's 180 days in jail and a $2,000 fine, and I want to lower that to a misdemeanor, which would be a $500 fine.
[00:19:32.074 --> 00:19:34.697]  And that is decriminalization of marijuana.
[00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:36.859]  I don't advocate the use of it.
[00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.060]  I'm just saying that I want to do that too.
[00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:39.701]  I don't either.
[00:19:39.761 --> 00:19:42.363]  You can hardly hire good employees because they're all so stoned in Austin.
[00:19:42.643 --> 00:19:46.807]  But the point is, is that they've got all these ads saying marijuana is terrorism.
[00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:50.029]  Marijuana has no connection to terrorism like cocaine and heroin.
[00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.231]  It has no connection to funding terrorism.
[00:19:53.152 --> 00:19:57.175]  And 87% of illegal drug users only use marijuana.
[00:19:57.656 --> 00:19:58.957]  And I don't think it's as bad as alcohol.
[00:19:59.477 --> 00:20:01.878]  I mean, I'd be against people stumbling around drunk on the job, too.
[00:20:02.518 --> 00:20:04.119]  The problem is, it's just all the potheads.
[00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:08.380]  I don't even like potheads, but the point is, you're right, you shouldn't be throwing them in prison.
[00:20:09.341 --> 00:20:11.261]  No, there's no place for them in prison.
[00:20:11.882 --> 00:20:18.204]  Now, the Austin Police Department, if they could pick up somebody with a small amount of marijuana, they'll give a citation.
[00:20:19.184 --> 00:20:20.844]  But that's not what the law says.
[00:20:21.064 --> 00:20:23.045]  If they want to do it, I think that's their policy.
[00:20:23.825 --> 00:20:26.326]  And I don't know what the Sheriff Department does.
[00:20:26.846 --> 00:20:29.226]  I'm not familiar with what they do when they pick somebody up.
[00:20:29.626 --> 00:20:31.047]  They probably comply with the law.
[00:20:31.447 --> 00:20:34.788]  But you're saying that you're going to decriminalize?
[00:20:34.968 --> 00:20:35.408]  That's right.
[00:20:35.928 --> 00:20:37.228]  I did that in 72.
[00:20:37.928 --> 00:20:41.149]  I appeared before the, no, 73 when the legislature met.
[00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:42.749]  That's when I, my first year in office.
[00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.450]  The senator in charge of the
[00:20:46.457 --> 00:20:46.898]  Yes, I do.
[00:21:08.915 --> 00:21:16.920]  My mom talked about in college, if anybody had long hair in the car, they'd pull you over and just tear your car apart, and if they found any marijuana, people would go to prison.
[00:21:17.301 --> 00:21:25.387]  But if you were wearing football jerseys and had short hair, you could be as drunk as you wanted, riding around shooting signs with shotguns, and they'd just smile at you.
[00:21:25.587 --> 00:21:26.287]  That's not right.
[00:21:27.428 --> 00:21:28.229]  I know that happens.
[00:21:29.285 --> 00:21:29.625]  Stay there.
[00:21:29.685 --> 00:21:30.546]  Long segment coming up.
[00:21:30.586 --> 00:21:33.747]  Plenty of time to get into tasers and a lot more and your website.
[00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:34.928]  Folks, donate to him.
[00:21:34.968 --> 00:21:35.408]  Get involved.
[00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:37.209]  There's a lot of election fraud in Travis County.
[00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:40.791]  But if there's a huge turnout for Raymond Franks, they may not be able to cover that up.
[00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.712]  He's a great guy.
[00:21:42.812 --> 00:21:46.754]  I can't think of having a better sheriff than Raymond Franks.
[00:21:46.814 --> 00:21:48.695]  He's somebody we really need here in Travis County.
[00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:49.255]  Stay with us.
[00:21:53.277 --> 00:21:54.158]  We're on the march.
[00:21:54.658 --> 00:21:56.179]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:21:57.189 --> 00:21:59.861]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:03.553 --> 00:22:12.277]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:22:12.477 --> 00:22:17.239]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:28.745]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:22:29.145 --> 00:22:34.690]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:40.995]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:22:41.175 --> 00:22:41.836]  What about you?

[00:23:08.908 --> 00:23:10.188]  And we knew what to do.
[00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:11.988]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:23:12.228 --> 00:23:18.650]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.451]  Whitman, EPA Director,
[00:23:22.935 --> 00:23:27.817]  On the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:23:28.157 --> 00:23:34.961]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:23:35.241 --> 00:23:38.322]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:23:38.422 --> 00:23:43.665]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:23:44.205 --> 00:23:46.726]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[00:23:56.226 --> 00:24:01.248]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.431]  Take a stand for health.

[00:24:19.963 --> 00:24:21.164]  Flush out toxins.
[00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:22.665]  Lower blood sugar levels.
[00:24:23.145 --> 00:24:24.927]  Annihilate acid reflux.
[00:24:25.307 --> 00:24:27.188]  You have Red Beckman?
[00:24:55.547 --> 00:24:56.768]  I sure do, he's all set and ready.
[00:24:56.788 --> 00:24:57.949]  All right, tell them I got home in five minutes.
[00:24:57.969 --> 00:24:58.249]  Here we go.
[00:24:58.409 --> 00:24:58.649]  Okay.
[00:25:06.155 --> 00:25:08.136]  Come, you masters of war.
[00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:12.539]  Here to build the big guns.
[00:25:14.921 --> 00:25:17.322]  Here to build the death planes.
[00:25:19.244 --> 00:25:21.145]  Here to build all the bombs.
[00:25:23.564 --> 00:25:35.795]  We're going to bring Red Beckman up for the balance of the hour with Sheriff Raymond Franks talking about the proper role of the sheriff who's elected by the people.
[00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.632]  We see Sheriff's Departments being abolished all over the country.
[00:25:39.672 --> 00:25:41.673]  We see the city taking over the Sheriff's Departments.
[00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:51.259]  Well, the Sheriff's Departments are the county that is commissioned and empowered by state law and by the state and by the legislature and then by the people that elect them at the county.
[00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:54.721]  So that is above the city that's an incorporated private corporation.
[00:25:55.652 --> 00:26:00.016]  And so, you know, we see this centralization of power away from the people.
[00:26:00.917 --> 00:26:08.143]  We're going to be talking about that with the father, the grandfather of the Fully Informed Jury Association, an expert on this, Red Beckman, coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:26:08.504 --> 00:26:12.848]  Jack McClam is going to join us, and riding shotgun the entire time, will be Sheriff Raymond Frank.
[00:26:13.288 --> 00:26:14.950]  RaymondFrank.com.
[00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.773]  Raymond, R-A-Y-M-O-N-D, Frank, dot com.
[00:26:19.313 --> 00:26:20.675]  So please, check it out.
[00:26:21.215 --> 00:26:29.617]  And, you know, if you're a person who's a retired peace officer, or you were a sheriff before, or a sheriff's deputy, why don't you run in your area?
[00:26:29.637 --> 00:26:31.117]  Why don't you educate the public about this?
[00:26:31.437 --> 00:26:33.358]  This is one way to hold back the tyranny.
[00:26:33.838 --> 00:26:38.899]  Going back to Sheriff Raymond Frank, tasers, you're saying you're going to ban them for use in the sheriff's department?
[00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:39.919]  Absolutely.
[00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:45.300]  No place for, it's a torturous weapon, no place for it in my department.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.821]  And how did you come upon that understanding, that realization?
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:50.741]  Well, I've done a lot of studying.
[00:26:50.761 --> 00:27:03.294]  The military won't use it, and they give a reason why, and it's based upon torture, and I'm against torture of any type, and I decided that that's the way it's going to be.
[00:27:03.834 --> 00:27:09.520]  Over 310 people have died in Canada and the United States as a result of tasering.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.722]  By the way, that's a conservative number.
[00:27:12.142 --> 00:27:17.227]  Well, that's what's been commonly reported in the newspapers.
[00:27:17.247 --> 00:27:29.619]  290 in America, and I'm not saying that the taser itself killed the guy, but the response later, he died from it, so maybe they fell from the balcony or something like that.
[00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:35.945]  Well, there have been a bunch of coroners and cardiologists who have said that it is killing people.
[00:27:37.342 --> 00:27:38.563]  Well, I believe it.
[00:27:39.303 --> 00:27:41.505]  By the way, they're boosting them from 50,000 watts to 75,000 watts.
[00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:44.327]  Yeah, I know that.
[00:27:45.028 --> 00:27:47.970]  At the Cal Palace in San Francisco, they had one on display.
[00:27:48.651 --> 00:27:50.432]  It attracted a lot of attention.
[00:27:50.633 --> 00:27:52.254]  Well, I mean, this is intimidation, too.
[00:27:52.274 --> 00:27:59.500]  When they had those secret FEMA camps we exposed in Denver, it said inside the barbed wire fences, you know, electric shock systems used here.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.001]  And these are cattle prods.
[00:28:02.401 --> 00:28:03.441]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[00:28:03.862 --> 00:28:07.964]  And now I understand they have bracelets that will fit on you, that they can apply.
[00:28:08.024 --> 00:28:13.486]  Homeland Security wants to make it, and Homeland Security did say they want it, to make everybody who flies wear a taser bracelet.
[00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:15.247]  God, it's horrible.
[00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:17.188]  I mean, who can come up with this stuff?
[00:28:17.428 --> 00:28:19.369]  It's like out of a science fiction movie.
[00:28:19.749 --> 00:28:20.349]  It sure is.
[00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.590]  Absolutely.
[00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:27.332]  I want to do what I can to... I saw you had an article about those type that are fired out of 12 gauges, too.
[00:28:27.892 --> 00:28:29.353]  That's right, it'll go 100 feet.
[00:28:29.693 --> 00:28:30.334]  Where's that article?
[00:28:30.354 --> 00:28:30.974]  I want to show people.
[00:28:32.093 --> 00:28:32.513]  We're good to go.
[00:28:49.618 --> 00:28:51.360]  And died in a hospital an hour later.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:58.585]  And the sad thing was that the man that shot him with the taser, the police officer, took his own life a couple days later.
[00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:00.526]  That was reported on NBC News.
[00:29:00.846 --> 00:29:02.427]  Yeah, he was the one that ordered them to shoot him.
[00:29:03.248 --> 00:29:05.229]  Just a terrible situation.
[00:29:05.249 --> 00:29:10.293]  And we've also seen the culture shift from the police and the sheriff's deputies being guardians of the people and being liked.
[00:29:10.633 --> 00:29:12.174]  You know, by and large, we're still some bad apples.
[00:29:12.475 --> 00:29:14.936]  To now, it really is a us-against-them mentality.
[00:29:15.196 --> 00:29:17.018]  How are they indoctrinating that into the police?
[00:29:18.723 --> 00:29:20.064]  I don't know for sure.
[00:29:20.324 --> 00:29:25.208]  I'm real anxious to find out what's going on in the Sheriff's Department Academy, what they teach.
[00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:27.510]  Do they teach anything about ethics?
[00:29:28.111 --> 00:29:39.179]  That's very important to me because of what happened in the Sheriff's Department recently where a guy was paying a man $10,000 if he would retire early so he could get promoted.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.421]  That made the paper for a couple of days.
[00:29:42.322 --> 00:29:47.106]  Those are, you know, they're taking advantage of the public trust and that's not right.
[00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:49.416]  Amazing.
[00:29:49.936 --> 00:29:54.297]  I want to bring Red Beckman up and we'll have plenty of time to get more into what you'll do as sheriff if you get elected again.
[00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:58.338]  You were in for eight years previously and been out of office for a while.
[00:29:58.458 --> 00:30:16.142]  Red Beckman, I wanted to get you on to comment on the important role of good sheriffs and the true power that sheriffs have as being the most, you know, powerful elected guardian of the people in a county and the move we're seeing to disarm them, to geld the sheriff's departments.
[00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:17.362]  Red Beckman, welcome.
[00:30:19.119 --> 00:30:20.220]  Good to be with you again.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.421]  Well, we've got a great guy on the line, Red Beckman, another great gentleman here with us, Raymond Frank.
[00:30:26.041 --> 00:30:27.922]  What do you think so far you're hearing about this man?
[00:30:29.082 --> 00:30:43.367]  Well, you know, our county sheriffs, nobody really understands, they just haven't been taught that the county sheriff is your best friend in your county.
[00:30:44.593 --> 00:30:44.613]  I
[00:31:15.539 --> 00:31:24.461]  If I was to put in one simple sentence the problem that we have in this country is that we have overdosed on propaganda.
[00:31:26.181 --> 00:31:32.383]  They feed us all this stuff calling it education and it's not an education, it's propaganda.
[00:31:33.223 --> 00:31:42.445]  And when they start telling people what the sheriff's position is really all about and how he's supposed to function, that's when you'll see sheriffs
[00:31:43.177 --> 00:31:47.300]  That will operate the way they are supposed to.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:55.366]  We've got people that are in sheriff's offices all over this country that don't have a clue.
[00:31:55.386 --> 00:32:02.991]  The real principle behind a sheriff's system, as we were given back there a long time ago, they just don't know.
[00:32:06.377 --> 00:32:12.720]  Well, this ties into the entire system of the state and its relationship to the federal system.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:22.324]  How they're gelding and taking over the sheriffs and turning them into minions of the cities that are supposed to be under them, because the cities are creatures of the state and the people.
[00:32:23.124 --> 00:32:26.405]  How they're dummying up the juries, the grand juries, all of it.
[00:32:26.706 --> 00:32:28.206]  How does this tie together, Red Beckman?
[00:32:28.846 --> 00:32:32.408]  Well, you see, ignorance.
[00:32:34.143 --> 00:32:38.546]  People that don't know the truth are easily manipulated and used.
[00:32:39.687 --> 00:32:43.990]  And so truth has to be, we have to get it out there.
[00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:48.273]  We have to get it out there to where it's available to people.
[00:32:48.373 --> 00:33:00.742]  And of course, the situation we've got right now in this country, we've never, you know, this country has never faced a trauma like we're facing right now, this economic thing.
[00:33:01.854 --> 00:33:02.415]  I don't
[00:33:27.415 --> 00:33:50.658]  Well, I'm an optimist, I always have been and I will be until the day I die because we do have truth that's available and it's available and people at this point are ready to learn and so our responsibility is to get the truth out there and let them hear the truth.
[00:33:52.851 --> 00:34:03.354]  And, of course, this thing with these tasers, I'll tell you, this is just, the gentleman you have there calling it torture, there's absolutely no other word for it.
[00:34:03.994 --> 00:34:06.535]  Fits it like calling it torture.
[00:34:07.315 --> 00:34:13.597]  And, of course, the founding fathers, they insisted that we not have a standing army in this country.
[00:34:14.357 --> 00:34:16.498]  Well, when the feds step in and when they
[00:34:17.307 --> 00:34:30.492]  When they start dictating to the Sheriff and the State Highway Patrol and everybody else, you end up with a standing army in the Forest Service.
[00:34:31.893 --> 00:34:39.956]  We always admired the Forest Service and their work with Smokey Bear and this type of thing.
[00:34:41.229 --> 00:34:42.710]  They've become law enforcement.
[00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.653]  Your Rangers out there in the hills are carrying guns.
[00:34:46.713 --> 00:34:47.854]  The BLM people.
[00:34:48.474 --> 00:35:00.043]  Well, the attitude, not just of the militarizing and turning all these other groups into police, and then militarizing, not just militarized police, but militarizing groups that weren't even policed previously,
[00:35:00.783 --> 00:35:05.827]  Is that it is an attitude at national parks and state parks and cops all over the country.
[00:35:06.247 --> 00:35:09.449]  It's rare to have a cop open a door for you and smile at you and be nice.
[00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.412]  Most of the time they look at you like you're a pile of steaming dog dew.
[00:35:13.452 --> 00:35:14.493]  I'm sorry to talk like that.
[00:35:14.933 --> 00:35:16.534]  Sheriff Franks, how did this happen?
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.501]  Well, I think Red hit the nail on the head.
[00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:22.742]  I think some of the sheriffs have been real lax.
[00:35:23.822 --> 00:35:28.284]  They're drawing a pretty darn good salary, and they're just letting things go.
[00:35:28.644 --> 00:35:37.487]  For instance, years ago, under Ronnie Earle and Judge Calvert, they tried to rewrite the Texas Constitution.
[00:35:38.147 --> 00:35:43.629]  And in that, they left it up to the legislature to decide whether or not a county would have a sheriff.
[00:35:44.238 --> 00:35:48.740]  Well, I was on the committee to fight that, and it was defeated.
[00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:56.504]  And if I'm elected sheriff, I want to be back on that committee because I... Exactly, because they're shutting sheriff's departments down all over the country.
[00:35:56.604 --> 00:36:06.109]  Yeah, we're a constitutional office, and I want... Travis County citizens, to me... And you have these unconstitutional municipal systems lobbying to get rid of you.
[00:36:06.874 --> 00:36:07.475]  Yeah, I know.
[00:36:07.495 --> 00:36:08.195]  Or absorb you.
[00:36:08.636 --> 00:36:12.539]  I want the citizens to realize that I look at them as my family.
[00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:17.943]  They're the ones that give the $118 million for the Travis County Sheriff's Department.
[00:36:18.324 --> 00:36:21.967]  I don't want my department to look at the people of Travis County as the enemy.
[00:36:22.067 --> 00:36:22.607]  Or food.
[00:36:23.008 --> 00:36:23.988]  They're our friends.
[00:36:24.689 --> 00:36:26.330]  I mean, we're now seen as food.
[00:36:26.711 --> 00:36:29.333]  And I'm going to make a lot of changes.
[00:36:29.373 --> 00:36:30.013]  We're going to order
[00:36:30.994 --> 00:36:32.295]  For instance, MREs.
[00:36:33.275 --> 00:36:39.979]  And have a big stock of those, because I know things are going to happen in this county and in America in the next couple years.
[00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:40.999]  It's going to be real bad.
[00:36:41.019 --> 00:36:48.563]  Well, I mean, regardless of whether it's going to happen or not, every county should be prepared its own self to help the public, not always wait on FEMA and the Feds.
[00:36:48.903 --> 00:36:55.527]  Yeah, now I think it looks to me like the department is just looking who they can give a ticket to.
[00:36:56.536 --> 00:36:57.496]  May I interject something?
[00:36:57.516 --> 00:36:57.597]  Yes.
[00:37:22.484 --> 00:37:40.010]  I had to make a run into town this morning and get a haircut, and the barber was telling me about how, he said, you have to be real careful right now, he said, the city cops and the highway patrol are out just handing out tickets wholesale.
[00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.631]  They must be running low on revenue.
[00:37:44.351 --> 00:37:50.733]  And I said, well, they are, because you see, as the stock market goes down,
[00:37:52.407 --> 00:38:02.050]  Uh, you know, there are some that say that as much as 65% of the risk capital, that's your capital in Wall Street, in the stock market.
[00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:19.234]  Our counties, cities, water districts, school districts, they've all... Yeah, and you see, these investors, these government entities, they didn't want to cut the price of fuel, they wanted Exxon to have
[00:38:20.198 --> 00:38:20.538]  I don't
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.661]  Oh, your different boards.
[00:38:43.401 --> 00:38:44.702]  Every county has got them.
[00:38:45.182 --> 00:38:46.743]  Planning boards, always.
[00:38:46.843 --> 00:38:53.346]  That was the comprehensive annual financial reports, and now with all these unfunded mandates and the rest of it, everything's going bankrupt.
[00:38:53.846 --> 00:38:57.308]  And believe me, folks, now that you don't have jobs, they're going to squeeze you even tighter.
[00:38:57.748 --> 00:38:59.990]  I mean, at a certain point, it's going to implode.
[00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.631]  I mean, how are cops going to squeeze blood out of a stone?
[00:39:03.892 --> 00:39:06.273]  Sheriff Franks, I mean, how is that going to happen as the economy gets worse?
[00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:20.206]  It's going to be real serious and it's going to be up to a good sheriff to take care of his people and not take advantage of, you know, giving an excessive number of tickets and things like that and concentrate on protecting our families.
[00:39:20.246 --> 00:39:21.127]  I mean, here's my question.
[00:39:22.448 --> 00:39:24.829]  I had my car broken into more than a decade ago.
[00:39:24.849 --> 00:39:26.971]  Everything's stolen, you know, the stereo, stuff like that.
[00:39:27.887 --> 00:39:28.768]  Police wouldn't come out.
[00:39:29.529 --> 00:39:31.031]  I was in Dallas years ago.
[00:39:32.213 --> 00:39:33.194]  My car got stolen.
[00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:35.537]  Cops laughed at me, said we can't help you.
[00:39:35.558 --> 00:39:36.098]  I hung up.
[00:39:36.118 --> 00:39:39.843]  They showed up mad, saying you don't hang up until we give you permission to hang up on 9-1-1.
[00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.747]  And then I've read all these articles around the country.
[00:39:43.388 --> 00:39:50.950]  Where the police are now saying, we're not even going to come to basic home invasions and basic robberies now, but we're going to be out there focusing on writing tickets to raise revenue.
[00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.830]  That's a serious crime now.
[00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.691]  They've said police aren't there to protect you and they have no liability to do it.
[00:39:56.671 --> 00:39:59.952]  But still, that's the overall idea they're putting out.
[00:40:00.112 --> 00:40:03.653]  Your comments on that, Sheriff Franks and then Red Beckman.
[00:40:04.454 --> 00:40:10.098]  The other day when I was campaigning, a young man that lives in Manor, Texas called the Sheriff's Office for assistance.
[00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:10.959]  Some problem.
[00:40:10.979 --> 00:40:15.963]  It wasn't a real major problem, but it was a problem to him and should have been dealt with by the county.
[00:40:16.744 --> 00:40:19.666]  And they told him, no, we don't have time to fool with that.
[00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:26.597]  I can't believe that the sheriff would allow his people to take that kind of an attitude and have that type of a policy.
[00:40:26.617 --> 00:40:31.222]  Well, also, 911 times have gone from 6 minutes to 8 minutes to 10 minutes to 12 minutes.
[00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:34.886]  The national average, I just saw it last week, 14 and a half minutes.
[00:40:35.486 --> 00:40:38.830]  But the government wants our guns, but then says the cops will be there in 14 minutes.
[00:40:40.555 --> 00:40:41.535]  Let me tell you something else.
[00:40:41.595 --> 00:40:55.858]  In the budget, in this past budget that ended September 30th, the Sheriff's Department purchased 79 new patrol cars, Crown Victorias, V8s, and got 25 additional personnel for their law enforcement bureau.
[00:40:55.938 --> 00:41:02.659]  I don't know what the bureau is, but that equipment and personnel are used to write tickets.
[00:41:02.999 --> 00:41:07.280]  That's primarily what they do, because there's portions of county, Travis County is not
[00:41:10.338 --> 00:41:26.047]  Well, that's because most of the money is taken and invested in the stock market, which, by the way, police, you're never going to see in your pension.
[00:41:26.087 --> 00:41:26.767]  It's never coming.
[00:41:26.847 --> 00:41:27.248]  It's over.
[00:41:27.468 --> 00:41:30.890]  The globalists are stealing it all right now, and I told you ten years ago it would happen, and you laughed.
[00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:32.951]  You're going to find out how much your new order loves you.
[00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:34.612]  What about this red Beckman?
[00:41:35.212 --> 00:41:36.433]  It came out yesterday.
[00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:38.614]  Well, that doesn't surprise me about Atlanta.
[00:42:06.281 --> 00:42:08.942]  Because they say they can't get anybody.
[00:42:08.982 --> 00:42:19.890]  Well, big cities such as Atlanta, they have, you know, they mollycoddled the criminals and such for so long.
[00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.533]  And, well, it's not just there.
[00:42:23.573 --> 00:42:29.878]  It's in the community where I'm at here in the state of Washington, 40 to 50,000 people here in a matter of 25 or 30 miles.
[00:42:29.898 --> 00:42:30.918]  That's not very many people.
[00:42:35.453 --> 00:42:42.994]  But, uh, they have all of these people running around that, uh, make a living off of crime.
[00:42:43.374 --> 00:42:47.655]  And, uh, they should be, uh, locked up or something.
[00:42:47.695 --> 00:42:54.136]  There has to be something done, uh, to, you know, to stop this crime wave.
[00:42:54.256 --> 00:42:54.857]  But they don't.
[00:42:54.957 --> 00:42:55.837]  They get the... Exactly.
[00:42:55.877 --> 00:43:01.918]  They leave the criminals alone and the illegal aliens alone, and they just squeeze the soccer mom and win five miles over the speed limit.
[00:43:01.938 --> 00:43:02.498]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:03.226 --> 00:43:07.012]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar or your own financial future?
[00:43:07.412 --> 00:43:12.159]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement savings account?
[00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:17.487]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events which could suddenly wipe out some or all of your hard-earned savings?
[00:43:17.767 --> 00:43:19.670]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.
[00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:28.255]  Individual retirement accounts and most 401Ks, 403Bs, SEFs and other retirement plans can be rolled over into self-directed accounts using gold and silver.
[00:43:28.335 --> 00:43:32.958]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process and that's where Midas Resources comes in.
[00:43:33.298 --> 00:43:39.021]  Call us at 1-866-323-5665 and we can help you with this process.
[00:43:39.522 --> 00:43:44.485]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial assets are failing.
[00:43:44.965 --> 00:43:48.187]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio.
[00:43:48.507 --> 00:43:49.528]  That's a question of when.
[00:43:49.908 --> 00:43:54.933]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a category 5 hurricane, the solution is the same.
[00:43:55.213 --> 00:43:58.316]  Call us today at 1-866-323-5665.

[00:44:00.939 --> 00:44:09.467]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:44:09.827 --> 00:44:11.509]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:44:12.443 --> 00:44:13.464]  But who is the enemy?
[00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:14.524]  Bin Laden.
[00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:15.725]  This is his M.O.
[00:44:15.745 --> 00:44:17.086]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:44:17.146 --> 00:44:18.807]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:19.147 --> 00:44:25.892]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:44:26.292 --> 00:44:26.732]  Some U.S.
[00:44:26.772 --> 00:44:32.436]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:44:33.116 --> 00:44:36.599]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:44:36.619 --> 00:44:46.865]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:44:47.105 --> 00:44:47.846]  Fabled enemies.

[00:45:03.157 --> 00:45:03.718]  You invest.
[00:45:03.878 --> 00:45:04.739]  You buy insurance.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:05.921]  You wear your seatbelt.
[00:45:06.182 --> 00:45:08.866]  You do things to ensure your family's future and protection.
[00:45:09.026 --> 00:45:09.526]  But why?
[00:45:09.867 --> 00:45:10.528]  Just in case?
[00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:13.893]  With the current state of affairs, ask yourself, am I ready?

[00:45:52.265 --> 00:45:53.226]  Sending out an SOS.
[00:45:53.246 --> 00:45:54.346]  This is not a free society.
[00:45:54.366 --> 00:45:56.748]  We're losing our hard fought and hard won liberties.
[00:46:12.773 --> 00:46:15.516]  We're going into a global control system.
[00:46:16.416 --> 00:46:22.002]  By the way, John, I want to start the next hour with the Drag'Em Off the Interstate, Sockitum, J.P.
[00:46:22.022 --> 00:46:22.502]  Blues.
[00:46:23.323 --> 00:46:24.124]  So cue that up.
[00:46:24.824 --> 00:46:25.665]  Sheriff Frank, you're laughing.
[00:46:25.685 --> 00:46:26.466]  Have you heard that song?
[00:46:26.666 --> 00:46:26.906]  Yeah.
[00:46:27.907 --> 00:46:29.889]  Had you ever heard it before listening to this show?
[00:46:29.949 --> 00:46:30.530]  I don't think so.
[00:46:33.371 --> 00:46:35.173]  It's a funny song, but it says it all.
[00:46:36.594 --> 00:46:38.075]  Going back to Red Beckman.
[00:46:38.436 --> 00:46:48.485]  Red, I remember ten years ago learning in Army press releases and in industry publications about how they were hiring felons and aggravated felons and illegal aliens for the military.
[00:46:49.065 --> 00:46:51.346]  And I would read those documents on air and people wouldn't believe me.
[00:46:51.386 --> 00:46:58.510]  Now, for about five years, they admit the biggest army recruiting centers in Mexico City, the second largest in Manila, Philippines, third largest in the Ukraine.
[00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:06.253]  They are converting our military over to foreigners, but also aggravated felons who are foreigners and aggravated felons out of prison here in the U.S.
[00:47:06.734 --> 00:47:08.194]  Stalin and Hitler did that.
[00:47:09.035 --> 00:47:11.756]  I want to get your take on that and then get Sheriff Frank's take on it.
[00:47:13.137 --> 00:47:17.519]  Well, you know, they make a big thing out of this terrorism.
[00:47:19.004 --> 00:47:42.362]  You know, terrorism, it doesn't rear its ugly head unless you have government that has become a tyranny, a government that is, you know, almighty and, you see, a government that is a tyranny.
[00:47:45.122 --> 00:48:05.276]  You end up with people that get hammered and they get hurt, they get damaged, and they reach a point where they have nothing to lose, and the only weapon they have is whatever they can devise by their innovations and this type of thing.
[00:48:05.717 --> 00:48:11.541]  You don't have terrorism unless you have a terrorist government.
[00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:22.585]  A government that's involved in terrorism will end up with terrorists, you know, in a war against terrorists.
[00:48:22.665 --> 00:48:27.588]  But not just that, we also have the manufacturing terrorism as a pretext to crack down on the population.
[00:48:27.608 --> 00:48:35.272]  Sheriff Frank, specifically in your Sheriff's Department, if you find out they've hired criminals, are you going to get rid of them?
[00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.071]  I'm sure going to try.
[00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:49.676]  I know the Sheriff's Department is a civil service operated, but I don't want convicted, I don't want any criminals working for me, because I want to maintain the highest of ethical standards.
[00:48:49.696 --> 00:48:51.217]  Can you believe we even have to discuss?
[00:48:52.798 --> 00:48:59.061]  My question, Red, and Sheriff Frank, when the government starts hiring criminals, you know it's an evil government.
[00:48:59.588 --> 00:49:00.208]  Absolutely.
[00:49:01.128 --> 00:49:06.530]  It's incomprehensible to think that we hire such people, especially in the military and so forth.
[00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:07.730]  It's ridiculous.
[00:49:09.051 --> 00:49:12.051]  Well, that's a big red flag, isn't it, Red?
[00:49:12.332 --> 00:49:12.932]  Absolutely.
[00:49:13.012 --> 00:49:20.354]  And of course, I'm old enough to where I've seen the progression over the years.
[00:49:20.694 --> 00:49:24.515]  And I remember what this country was.
[00:49:27.032 --> 00:49:33.217]  I compare what's happening today with what happened in the 1930s with the Depression.
[00:49:34.318 --> 00:49:35.579]  People helped each other.
[00:49:37.281 --> 00:49:39.242]  People looked out for each other.
[00:49:39.262 --> 00:49:45.648]  I can see this thing coming now, and people are going to keep their doors locked.
[00:49:45.828 --> 00:49:51.313]  They're going to be looking inward rather than outward.
[00:49:53.206 --> 00:49:53.946]  It's not.
[00:49:54.167 --> 00:50:01.210]  I mean, the picture is going to get real ugly because, you know, they talk about a 1930s depression.
[00:50:01.671 --> 00:50:04.372]  We aren't going to have a 1930s depression.
[00:50:04.472 --> 00:50:10.675]  It's going to be so much worse than the 1930s that there won't be any comparison, whatever.
[00:50:11.076 --> 00:50:14.558]  And on top of it, we're going to have militarized police running around squeezing people.
[00:50:15.038 --> 00:50:15.758]  Absolutely.
[00:50:15.878 --> 00:50:17.439]  And, well, terrorizing.
[00:50:17.859 --> 00:50:20.801]  And the result is going to be terrorism.
[00:50:21.536 --> 00:50:22.617]  Coming back on them.
[00:50:22.697 --> 00:50:25.599]  And you mean real, not even, I agree, not even manufactured.
[00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:27.079]  I wouldn't call it terrorism.
[00:50:27.099 --> 00:50:28.500]  You're going to have physical resistance.
[00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:30.401]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:31.962]  Red, stay there.
[00:50:31.982 --> 00:50:38.286]  Do five more minutes with us, then at the 8 after, we're going to have Officer Jack McClam on with us.
[00:50:38.767 --> 00:50:40.348]  Sheriff Raymond Frank is our guest.
[00:50:40.368 --> 00:50:40.868]  Stay with us.
[00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.792]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:50:47.372 --> 00:50:50.034]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:50:53.394 --> 00:51:06.100]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:06.521 --> 00:51:13.284]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[00:51:13.604 --> 00:51:14.044]  We're good to go.
[00:51:44.524 --> 00:51:46.785]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[00:51:47.145 --> 00:51:52.468]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:52:08.456 --> 00:52:25.415]  Well, I just hopped over the old state line My headlights focused on a welcome sign When hiding in the bushes there waiting for me Was a big policeman with a capital P Shouting, look out stranger, you're heading for danger There's a welcome sign ahead
[00:52:26.588 --> 00:52:43.412]  He dragged me off to the old town square The justice of the peace are waiting for his share He said, lookie here boy, you better slow down In a heap of trouble in this one-horse town So look out stranger, you're heading for danger There's a welcome sign ahead
[00:52:43.712 --> 00:52:48.974]  Sheriff, the line I like is about the woman's getting mugged in the heart of town.
[00:52:49.975 --> 00:52:51.615]  Calls for help, but there's none around.
[00:52:52.496 --> 00:52:57.017]  They're out on the interstate setting the trap, looking for a live one to skin and wrap.
[00:52:57.057 --> 00:52:58.338]  Here, that's coming up right now.
[00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:06.842]  Drag him off to the interstate, sock it to him, J.P.
[00:53:06.862 --> 00:53:07.542]  Blues.
[00:53:08.982 --> 00:53:13.603]  You better pray to me and you better lick my boots, I'm an officer and you're a lowly civilian!
[00:53:13.623 --> 00:53:15.884]  There's a welcome sign ahead.
[00:53:34.562 --> 00:53:36.163]  That's pretty good, isn't it?
[00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:04.672]  You were saying during the break, the little break, that if everything breaks down, not in Travis County.
[00:54:04.692 --> 00:54:16.176]  I mean, we desperately need a real sheriff with sheriff's deputies and police that are guardians of the people and are going after crime, not raising revenue for these bankers who run these scams.
[00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:23.540]  Yeah, I want the citizens of Travis County, property owners and so forth, to know that we're out there to help you.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.727]  We're not out there to harm you, to find some way to give you a hard time in court.
[00:54:28.767 --> 00:54:32.533]  We're out there to help you, and you can call me if you want to.
[00:54:33.596 --> 00:54:38.900]  I have a telephone number in the phone book, and I'll be accessed by a phone at the Sheriff's Office.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:48.347]  Now you were saying that if you're elected again as Sheriff, that within, you were in there a few decades ago, that within 24 hours, you or one of your deputies will call them back.
[00:54:48.507 --> 00:54:49.307]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:54:49.808 --> 00:54:54.731]  It'll be shorter than 24 hours, but we're going to be your Sheriff.
[00:54:54.972 --> 00:54:57.754]  Well, I don't mean like on a call, I mean just to talk to you.
[00:54:58.234 --> 00:54:59.375]  That's right, absolutely.
[00:55:00.575 --> 00:55:03.657]  Well, in closing, Red Beckman, we appreciate you popping in with us today.
[00:55:04.118 --> 00:55:07.060]  Just Google Red Beckman on YouTube or Google Video.
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:09.782]  You can watch hundreds of presentations he's done.
[00:55:10.163 --> 00:55:14.206]  Fire out your address for somebody if they want to get that little book, Walls in Our Minds.
[00:55:14.726 --> 00:55:15.227]  Red Beckman.
[00:55:16.067 --> 00:55:26.676]  My address is Red Beckman at Post Office Box 61 Carrolls, C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S.
[00:55:26.836 --> 00:55:28.037]  Carrolls, Washington.
[00:55:29.929 --> 00:55:30.730]  9-8-6-0-9.
[00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:39.453]  We've sent out a lot of them, and we don't get any of them back, I'll assure you of that.
[00:55:39.473 --> 00:55:40.413]  It's five bucks, right?
[00:55:41.033 --> 00:55:41.273]  What?
[00:55:41.653 --> 00:55:42.634]  Five bucks.
[00:55:43.674 --> 00:55:44.334]  For that booklet.
[00:55:44.934 --> 00:55:47.175]  In the last minute we've got with you, we're going to come back with the Sheriff.
[00:55:48.035 --> 00:55:49.436]  I do see a massive awakening.
[00:55:49.476 --> 00:55:50.956]  I do see positive things happening.
[00:55:50.976 --> 00:55:51.817]  Do you agree with that statement?
[00:55:52.397 --> 00:55:56.838]  Oh, absolutely, because people are getting some real jolts.
[00:55:56.898 --> 00:55:58.299]  They're getting some real shock.
[00:55:59.427 --> 00:56:03.309]  And their 401ks and such are in trouble.
[00:56:03.429 --> 00:56:05.410]  And they ain't seen nothing yet, have they?
[00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.931]  They haven't seen nothing yet.
[00:56:08.291 --> 00:56:09.251]  It's going to get worse.
[00:56:09.271 --> 00:56:11.912]  You know, you've written the definitive book on the Federal Reserve.
[00:56:12.593 --> 00:56:14.414]  You're the icon of that as well.
[00:56:15.954 --> 00:56:17.835]  No doubt in your mind this is engineered, correct?
[00:56:18.415 --> 00:56:19.176]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:56:19.236 --> 00:56:20.016]  This is planned.
[00:56:20.056 --> 00:56:21.497]  They want their new world order.
[00:56:22.317 --> 00:56:26.999]  And they're bringing it on fast right now.
[00:56:27.703 --> 00:56:34.228]  And the only thing that is slowing them down at all is the fact that we still have our guns in this country.
[00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:41.574]  And of course, the people are waking up and there's a lot of people in Washington, D.C.
[00:56:42.234 --> 00:56:44.716]  that are very, very unhappy, very nervous.
[00:56:45.017 --> 00:56:45.957]  They're very nervous.
[00:56:47.078 --> 00:56:48.980]  They're not too sure of themselves right now.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.861]  All right, Red Beckman, I look forward to speaking to you in the near future.
[00:56:52.921 --> 00:56:54.381]  God bless you and thanks for coming on with us.
[00:56:54.781 --> 00:56:55.101]  You bet.
[00:56:55.701 --> 00:56:59.762]  All right, more with Sheriff Raymond Franks and Jack McClam in three minutes.

[00:57:26.585 --> 00:57:28.968]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[00:57:29.328 --> 00:57:31.410]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:31.911]  this fall?

[00:58:03.157 --> 00:58:09.521]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:58:09.901 --> 00:58:11.882]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:58:12.543 --> 00:58:13.583]  But who is the enemy?
[00:58:14.084 --> 00:58:14.624]  Bin Laden.
[00:58:14.884 --> 00:58:15.885]  This is his ammo.
[00:58:15.905 --> 00:58:17.206]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:58:17.246 --> 00:58:18.907]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:58:19.247 --> 00:58:26.011]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:58:26.411 --> 00:58:26.831]  Some U.S.
[00:58:26.891 --> 00:58:32.535]  investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:58:33.235 --> 00:58:36.716]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:58:36.736 --> 00:58:46.958]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[00:58:47.198 --> 00:58:47.938]  Fabled enemies.

[00:59:14.858 --> 00:59:15.158]  I think so.

[00:59:52.035 --> 00:59:55.058]  Cleaning the body and home from the inside out.
[01:00:03.407 --> 01:00:05.589]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:09.031]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.512 --> 01:00:13.333]  We're here with Sheriff Raymond Frank, former Travis County Sheriff.
[01:00:13.353 --> 01:00:14.474]  He's a Van Tazer.
[01:00:14.534 --> 01:00:15.134]  He was re-elected.
[01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:17.116]  He was in a few decades ago.
[01:00:18.456 --> 01:00:21.018]  Highly decorated Air Force pilot.
[01:00:21.198 --> 01:00:23.840]  3,600 hours on and on and on.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.342]  Travis County Sheriff running for Sheriff again to Van Tazers.
[01:00:27.362 --> 01:00:28.583]  He criminalized marijuana.
[01:00:30.163 --> 01:00:32.864]  Uh, to stop writing all these tickets and actually respond to crime.
[01:00:32.904 --> 01:00:39.006]  I wanted to get Jack McClam on for, uh, much of the rest of the hour with us to ride shotgun with us to talk about the real role of the sheriff.
[01:00:39.526 --> 01:00:42.767]  All this talk about martial law, but we were talking about the 360 bridge for some reason.
[01:00:43.287 --> 01:00:48.049]  You were talking about Honeysuckle Rose, uh, and that, uh, movie with Willie Nelson.
[01:00:48.429 --> 01:00:49.769]  And I said, oh, you know Willie.
[01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:51.590]  And then you were telling me that, uh, uh,
[01:00:52.531 --> 01:00:57.541]  One of his family members was one of your deputies that you do know, Willie, and that you were in a movie with him.
[01:00:57.862 --> 01:01:00.207]  So you've been around, Sheriff Frank.
[01:01:00.247 --> 01:01:00.888]  Tell us about that.
[01:01:01.314 --> 01:01:04.456]  Yeah, well, I was a friend of Willie Nelson when it wasn't cool to be a friend.
[01:01:04.996 --> 01:01:06.797]  In fact, he was kind of derogatory.
[01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:09.779]  Went back with his IRS trouble and all that?
[01:01:09.819 --> 01:01:10.399]  Way back.
[01:01:10.619 --> 01:01:11.800]  Well, even before that.
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.581]  I'm talking about the seventies, early seventies.
[01:01:13.601 --> 01:01:14.641]  How was that derogatory?
[01:01:14.761 --> 01:01:15.021]  Yeah.
[01:01:15.402 --> 01:01:19.104]  Well, because, you know, he was considered sort of an outlaw or something.
[01:01:19.124 --> 01:01:19.664]  Yeah, radical.
[01:01:20.064 --> 01:01:21.185]  Radical and everything.
[01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:28.328]  But his nephew was my deputy, and he was the finest deputy I ever had, and he died accidentally in a car accident.
[01:01:29.869 --> 01:01:33.652]  Randy Fletcher was his name, and his mother plays piano.
[01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:37.155]  Bobby plays piano for Willie, and she's a friend of mine.
[01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:45.242]  And by the way, Willie has played three times, I think, before to fundraisers for me when I ran for sheriff.
[01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:47.523]  And he's for me, I can tell you that.
[01:01:48.264 --> 01:01:48.904]  We're good friends.
[01:02:01.152 --> 01:02:11.098]  You know, he's putting out similar water from air things as we are, but he literally just put his name on it because he wants to do something real environmental for him to have all this, you know, bottled water.
[01:02:12.018 --> 01:02:17.842]  And I mean, he's literally, it was in the States, but he's literally doing that with really no profit for himself just to get that idea out.
[01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:19.963]  Just like he did biodiesel.
[01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:22.445]  Just like he's had so many other, I mean, he really is a good guy.
[01:02:22.485 --> 01:02:24.085]  I mean, I mean, I mean, he really does care.
[01:02:24.626 --> 01:02:26.367]  And that's neat that you've known him so long.
[01:02:27.116 --> 01:02:34.518]  Yeah, well, you know, one time somebody walked in his trailer at a concert and he said, well, what is that stuff I smell?
[01:02:35.358 --> 01:02:38.519]  And Willie said, you don't smell anything.
[01:02:38.539 --> 01:02:46.861]  So, you know, I guess the guy was suggesting that Willie had used some marijuana or something, but I don't smell it and you don't either.
[01:02:48.362 --> 01:02:49.722]  He's quite a guy.
[01:02:49.762 --> 01:02:51.562]  So what did you do in that movie with Willie?
[01:02:51.963 --> 01:02:53.023]  Well, we were in the...
[01:02:54.369 --> 01:03:02.117]  Randy, the kid that was killed, we were up at Briarcliff and they had just driven up from Mexico in the bus.
[01:03:04.376 --> 01:03:08.360]  Randy Fletcher said, I hope neither of you were driving at each point of the finger at each other.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:17.348]  But I was in that scene and got to meet Willie again and also Slim Pickens and that was a great experience.
[01:03:17.428 --> 01:03:21.532]  And then also we also filmed the scene down by the bridge there on 360.
[01:03:25.436 --> 01:03:26.677]  That was interesting too.
[01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:34.022]  I'm proud to be a friend of Willie Nelson and I appreciate all the causes that he's involved in and so forth.
[01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:35.504]  It's just tremendous.
[01:03:36.124 --> 01:03:36.885]  He's a neat guy.
[01:03:36.905 --> 01:03:40.207]  Okay, he's been back in Austin the last few weeks.
[01:03:40.227 --> 01:03:41.428]  We just went back on tour today.
[01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:44.531]  Let's go to Jack McClam, Officer Jack McClam.
[01:03:44.891 --> 01:03:47.473]  I wanted to have you on Jack because Raymond Frank is a great guy.
[01:03:47.493 --> 01:03:49.895]  He's anti-New World Order and so much has happened.
[01:03:49.915 --> 01:03:52.297]  I also want to talk about all the martial law developments we've been seeing.
[01:03:52.697 --> 01:03:56.698]  Yeah, I mean, everything we've talked about is now coming true, but it's such old hat to us.
[01:03:57.118 --> 01:04:03.999]  A lot of us, I think myself included, aren't even responding as vehemently and as seriously as we should because it's new to the public and they're now freaking out.
[01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:08.240]  It's all over the news as the news introduces it to people and Glenn Beck introduces it to the public.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:15.662]  But, you know, for a lot of us that have been saying, you know, seeing it being engineered for so long, you know, we're kind of like, in a way, sitting back.
[01:04:16.902 --> 01:04:20.343]  I think that's a dangerous psychological development, but it's one we have to be honest about.
[01:04:20.683 --> 01:04:22.023]  Jack McClam, good to have you here with us.
[01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:28.230]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:33.376]  Very good to be with you today, and good to be on with Sheriff Franks.
[01:04:33.817 --> 01:04:36.500]  Thank you, Sheriff Franks, for your service to the public.
[01:04:36.901 --> 01:04:41.746]  Well, I have a lot of respect for you, Jack, and listen to your program all the time on radio.
[01:04:42.776 --> 01:04:45.718]  That's right, it's on here locally on 90.1.
[01:04:46.099 --> 01:04:48.981]  Oh yeah, Sheriff Frank is a total anti-New World Order.
[01:04:49.001 --> 01:04:57.568]  I mean, you've always been pro-liberty, but Sheriff Frank, Raymond Frank, when did you, and we'll go back to Jack in a second, but that's a good question, when did you first wake up to the New World Order?
[01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:03.193]  Probably in 1972, when a friend of mine in the Air Force,
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.142]  That's right, you were saying, you knew all this was coming, you bought a bunch of silver in the 70's.
[01:05:26.428 --> 01:05:29.149]  Sure did, for real, like a buck and a half an ounce.
[01:05:30.889 --> 01:05:34.971]  And now it's up to 20 and it's probably going to go to 100 in the next couple years.
[01:05:35.051 --> 01:05:36.291]  I don't think there's any doubt about it.
[01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:37.371]  Absolutely.
[01:05:38.672 --> 01:05:56.017]  Jack McClam, I want to get into the bigger picture of martial law and the new rule of order, but how important is it to have the people take their counties back with the sheriffs and put the sheriff back in their dominant role as the most highly powerful elected representative instead of the states and the counties and the cities trying to get rid of sheriffs?
[01:05:56.317 --> 01:05:58.078]  Why is the establishment afraid of sheriffs?
[01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:05.602]  Yes, it's so important, brother, because the sheriff is truly the chief executive officer in the county.
[01:06:06.442 --> 01:06:09.604]  And, sadly, many of the sheriffs don't know that.
[01:06:10.504 --> 01:06:18.008]  And so, they, in many of the eastern states today, they've been relegated to just process servers.
[01:06:18.788 --> 01:06:23.591]  Not law enforcement anymore, the state police, the local police, and the federal
[01:06:24.412 --> 01:06:24.692]  I think so.
[01:06:42.359 --> 01:06:57.482]  Yeah, they've never seen law enforcement they don't love, but the one area of peace officers known as law enforcement where it's for the people, has the real power, they're getting rid of that because they know.
[01:06:58.843 --> 01:06:59.543]  That's right.
[01:06:59.703 --> 01:07:00.703]  Very, very true.
[01:07:00.963 --> 01:07:04.484]  And the Attorney General for the state of Washington
[01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:12.312]  Here, a few years back, said this, the Office of Sheriff is one of the oldest offices known to the common law jurisprudence.
[01:07:13.152 --> 01:07:25.961]  A clear statement of the significance of the Office of Sheriff within the county, both historically and under present statutes, is found in Anderson on Sheriff's Corners and Constables, page 6.
[01:07:27.142 --> 01:07:33.606]  And it says in there, in the exercise of executive and administrative functions in conserving the public peace,
[01:07:34.537 --> 01:07:45.605]  In vindicating the law and in preserving the rights of the government, he, the sheriff, represents the sovereignty of the state, and he has no superior in the county.
[01:07:46.286 --> 01:08:06.458]  And I wish, we're working hard here at Aid and Abet Police Military Newsletter to try to get our sheriff's video out and our sheriff's newsletter out to all the sheriffs around the nation so that they'll realize that they have great jurisdiction and great power and they do not have to listen to the federal authorities that come into their county.
[01:08:06.818 --> 01:08:19.944]  Well, Jack, as a sheriff in the 70s, Raymond Frank on the front lines, when they were just starting to try to get rid of sheriffs, he went to the legislature when they were about to basically disband them, or make them appointed, and Sheriff Frank helped stop that.
[01:08:19.984 --> 01:08:23.025]  So he's kind of an unsung great granddaddy in this fight.
[01:08:23.045 --> 01:08:24.826]  Tell us about testifying before the legislature.
[01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:27.193]  Well, yeah.
[01:08:28.353 --> 01:08:36.297]  Somehow, our district attorney and a pretty well-known judge was on a committee to rewrite the Constitution.
[01:08:37.418 --> 01:08:43.480]  And, of course, my office is a constitutional office, which I'm very proud of, and one of the things they did was
[01:08:45.382 --> 01:08:54.266]  Do away with the sheriff and allow the legislature to provide the okay for counties to have a sheriff if they needed one.
[01:08:54.767 --> 01:09:03.791]  Well, we fought that and it was defeated and I'm going to be on the alert for that, you know, because it'll probably come up again sometime.
[01:09:03.831 --> 01:09:05.332]  Oh yes, it sure will, brother.
[01:09:05.412 --> 01:09:07.553]  Thank you so much for that, Sheriff Frank.
[01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:08.633]  Thank you so much.
[01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:09.353]  You're welcome.
[01:09:09.394 --> 01:09:14.036]  Yes, I remember in my Phoenix Police Department
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:27.283]  I was made, within the first three years that I was on the force, the most highly decorated officer in the police department, and then I developed a bad side.
[01:09:27.983 --> 01:09:34.885]  According to the government anyway, I never accepted any immoral or unconstitutional orders from superiors.
[01:09:35.581 --> 01:09:39.683]  Or in any way violated my oath to defend the Constitution and the people's rights.
[01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:45.585]  And I'm now the most fired officer in the history of Phoenix, Arizona.
[01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:47.846]  Not only the most decorated, but the most fired.
[01:09:47.866 --> 01:09:59.131]  So, I know how hard it is today for law enforcement, peace officers, and sheriffs to stand up and do what's right because
[01:09:59.815 --> 01:10:07.080]  The New World Order gang of thieves that control the federal government and many of the state governments also don't want that.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.502]  They don't want the people to have a representative and a protector.
[01:10:11.162 --> 01:10:12.503]  And that's who the sheriff is.
[01:10:12.963 --> 01:10:20.428]  Well, that's why people listening in Illinois and in Florida and in California, everywhere, they're trying to get rid of sheriffs all over the country.
[01:10:20.668 --> 01:10:20.948]  Right.
[01:10:21.109 --> 01:10:24.611]  And this is absolutely important that people support Raymond Franks.
[01:10:25.211 --> 01:10:31.693]  RaymondFrank.com and contribute to your campaign now or help you as volunteers.
[01:10:32.613 --> 01:10:42.896]  Because we've got to get the word out that this is the sheriff we need, not the child kidnapping, and we had that previously, new world order, new age scum.
[01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:46.317]  We've had some bad sheriffs.
[01:10:49.798 --> 01:10:51.979]  CPS and kids for no reason, you name it.
[01:10:52.912 --> 01:11:02.018]  Well, I'll tell you, the people that I inherit in the Sheriff Department will be fully indoctrinated because what they do is just like me doing it.
[01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:18.548]  When I deputize them, that's just like me doing something, and they're going to be oriented towards serving the people and protecting the people and not just give tickets on Highway 35 like I saw one do about four weeks ago on my way to Pflugerville.
[01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:21.190]  Hey, what do you think of the new Austin Police Chief?
[01:11:22.282 --> 01:11:22.822]  I like him.
[01:11:23.142 --> 01:11:23.622]  I like him.
[01:11:24.543 --> 01:11:27.623]  One reason I like him is because he's for transparency.
[01:11:27.703 --> 01:11:28.603]  And that's what I'm for.
[01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:30.084]  I know this.
[01:11:30.164 --> 01:11:31.184]  It turned out he's a fan.
[01:11:31.224 --> 01:11:34.245]  And I know folks that know him separately from me where he is a fan.
[01:11:34.285 --> 01:11:38.506]  Like at dinner parties talking about me or at other radio stations doing Alex Jones imitations.
[01:11:38.906 --> 01:11:42.866]  I thought he was either really slick or a good guy when he was in studio.
[01:11:43.106 --> 01:11:44.207]  He pretty much sought us out.
[01:11:44.247 --> 01:11:44.767]  Did you know that?
[01:11:45.027 --> 01:11:45.707]  I didn't know that.
[01:11:46.567 --> 01:11:47.868]  Jack, what does that sound like to you?
[01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:49.648]  Do you think I can trust the Austin Police Chief?
[01:11:50.729 --> 01:11:53.194]  Well, I certainly hope you can.
[01:11:53.214 --> 01:11:56.179]  Sounds like that he's got some good principles there.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:00.427]  We'll just have to wait and see, but I would befriend him for sure.
[01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:01.108]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:12:01.128 --> 01:12:01.709]  We're coming right back.
[01:12:03.334 --> 01:12:05.195]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:12:05.315 --> 01:12:12.019]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:12:12.299 --> 01:12:20.463]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:12:20.684 --> 01:12:26.467]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:12:26.487 --> 01:12:28.368]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:12:28.448 --> 01:12:30.549]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:34.954]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:12:35.134 --> 01:12:37.277]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:12:37.357 --> 01:12:45.186]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:12:45.606 --> 01:12:46.086]  We're good to go.
[01:13:03.933 --> 01:13:04.794]  Nothing else on Earth.
[01:13:05.054 --> 01:13:11.138]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:13:11.338 --> 01:13:15.160]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:17.402]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:13:17.442 --> 01:13:19.743]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:13:19.883 --> 01:13:26.968]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:13:27.008 --> 01:13:27.888]  We're good to go.
[01:13:44.777 --> 01:13:45.117]  We're good.
[01:14:05.523 --> 01:14:10.528]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:14:10.548 --> 01:14:12.150]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:14:12.230 --> 01:14:15.073]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:14:15.133 --> 01:14:19.237]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:33.277]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:40.913]  How dare you?
[01:14:41.153 --> 01:14:44.594]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:47.395]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:14:47.475 --> 01:14:53.918]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.541]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:15:02.356 --> 01:15:06.780]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:12.184]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[01:15:12.745 --> 01:15:14.567]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings.
[01:15:15.007 --> 01:15:17.089]  Walk on well-lit paths with friends or students.
[01:15:17.729 --> 01:15:20.391]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[01:15:20.732 --> 01:15:22.233]  Know how to reach campus security.
[01:15:22.653 --> 01:15:25.716]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[01:15:26.204 --> 01:15:28.525]  And always carry a self-defense device.
[01:15:29.005 --> 01:15:32.106]  This important message is brought to you by Pepperspray.com.

[01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:34.170]  All right, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:35.732 --> 01:16:45.120]  We'll have Jack McClam and Sheriff Frank with us for about another 15 minutes, and I'm going to cover all the final financial news of the day with everybody.
[01:16:45.881 --> 01:16:54.129]  Stock market went down about 400 points, and it went back up 217 points past its low of the day, or past its low
[01:16:55.532 --> 01:17:00.615]  It's closed yesterday, so a lot of market manipulation going on there.
[01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:02.557]  The big news blitz coming up.
[01:17:05.018 --> 01:17:11.242]  Jack McClam, we're seeing Congress come out and say they were threatened with martial law, they didn't pass the Banker Takeover Bill.
[01:17:11.943 --> 01:17:16.045]  We're seeing so much of the new or older system unfold right in front of us.
[01:17:16.085 --> 01:17:21.429]  What do you see happening on the economy front and the whole police state front in the short and long term?
[01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:24.940]  Well, they're really pushing.
[01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:35.287]  Cheney and Bush want to stay in as dictators of America, so they'd like to have us under martial law before the election so they can cancel the election.
[01:17:35.888 --> 01:17:46.996]  But see, they're the puppets of the Council on Foreign Relations, so they have to wait for a decision from the Council on Foreign Relations if they're going to have abomination or traitor McCain.
[01:17:47.905 --> 01:17:56.907]  As our president, or is the CFR going to allow them to put us under martial law and stay in as dictators themselves before the election?
[01:17:57.487 --> 01:18:16.291]  So, it's all up to the Council on Foreign Relations, really, as to who our next dictator will be, because Abomination appointed the president of the Council on Foreign Relations as his campaign chief, and then he appointed a top communist in the country.
[01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:23.514]  He's a big new Brzezinski as his foreign policy manager, and he is a hardcore communist.
[01:18:24.054 --> 01:18:40.998]  You know, in Houston, I guess you probably heard, Alex, that in Houston, when you walk in the front door of his presidential campaign headquarters, he had a picture of the number one guerrilla warfare terrorist
[01:18:43.473 --> 01:18:44.855]  I can't even think of his name now.
[01:18:44.995 --> 01:18:45.797]  Che Guevara?
[01:18:46.017 --> 01:18:46.718]  Che Guevara.
[01:18:47.419 --> 01:18:53.669]  A flag of Che Guevara right behind his secretary, his greeter that greets you when you come in.
[01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.373]  Now they've taken it down, but we have a picture of it.
[01:18:57.233 --> 01:19:00.634]  Of course we have the bankers funding those that want communism.
[01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:03.195]  But also, Trader McCain, I'm a Vietnam veteran and have
[01:19:20.314 --> 01:19:25.438]  Actually, 30 years ago, I talked to POWs that told us what a traitor John McCain was.
[01:19:25.739 --> 01:19:34.546]  He is not a war hero at all, but he is a member for the last 15 years of the Council on Foreign Relations, so there'll be no changes.
[01:19:34.626 --> 01:19:41.671]  Whatever the Council on Foreign Relations says, and they want the New World Order, Obama Nation and traitor McCain and
[01:19:42.532 --> 01:19:45.154]  Katie and Bush are going to follow their orders.
[01:19:45.334 --> 01:19:53.581]  Sheriff Frank, I'll ask you the same question that I brought up to Police Chief Acevedo when he was in studio with us a couple months ago.
[01:19:54.201 --> 01:20:10.875]  If the Feds come in and announce that they want you to go out and arrest a couple thousand quote political dissidents, you know, without warrants, without proof, without indictments, or without, you know, any charges, what are you going to tell the Feds if they try to come in here and federalize things under Presidential Decision Directive 51 of your sheriff?
[01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:20.313]  Well, they're going to be told that they're going to have to face my deputy sheriffs who are armed with rifles and ready to deny what they want to do.
[01:20:20.753 --> 01:20:21.854]  I'm not going to allow that.
[01:20:21.874 --> 01:20:24.756]  Sheriff Frank, let me ask you something.
[01:20:25.176 --> 01:20:38.306]  When I was a cop in Phoenix, I was one that helped set up the local, in South Phoenix, the local
[01:20:39.694 --> 01:20:42.476]  Anti-crime units in the counties.
[01:20:43.818 --> 01:21:05.696]  I set up a hundred of these block watches in the counties in South Phoenix, which was the war zone of Phoenix, and I helped the sheriff set up a 3,000-man posse of county residents that became posse members, over 3,000 of them, and I hope that, Sheriff Franks, that you will go to your
[01:21:06.645 --> 01:21:10.007]  What about the county posse where the people control it?
[01:21:24.212 --> 01:21:34.437]  Well, Texas state law provides a provision where the sheriff can deputize our citizens as deputies, and I intend to do that.
[01:21:34.817 --> 01:21:36.038]  Good deal, praise God.
[01:21:36.298 --> 01:21:43.241]  And I intend to have a roster of all those people that I know will perform as they should perform.
[01:21:43.261 --> 01:21:44.502]  See folks, you want a solution.
[01:21:44.602 --> 01:21:51.245]  Get our sheriffs back, get patriots in the positions, activate the posse as a defense against crime and the federal terrorist.
[01:21:51.546 --> 01:21:52.146]  We'll be right back.
[01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:56.244]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:21:57.186 --> 01:21:59.849]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:03.172 --> 01:22:06.934]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.

[01:23:03.055 --> 01:23:09.420]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.762]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:23:12.443 --> 01:23:13.463]  But who is the enemy?
[01:23:13.984 --> 01:23:14.524]  Bin Laden.
[01:23:14.785 --> 01:23:15.665]  This is his ammo.
[01:23:15.705 --> 01:23:17.086]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:23:17.126 --> 01:23:18.808]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:23:19.148 --> 01:23:25.893]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:23:26.294 --> 01:23:26.734]  Some U.S.
[01:23:26.774 --> 01:23:32.459]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:23:33.119 --> 01:23:36.600]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:38.601]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:24:04.645 --> 01:24:09.931]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming, but it will be available sometime in the future?

[01:24:16.599 --> 01:24:19.522]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation.
[01:24:19.702 --> 01:24:27.844]  We can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size and many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[01:24:27.984 --> 01:24:31.085]  We offer a real solution using real science.
[01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:35.307]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.
[01:24:35.587 --> 01:24:38.748]  A simple, easy way to eliminate the threat of cancer.
[01:24:39.048 --> 01:24:41.068]  Laser technology at its best.
[01:24:41.308 --> 01:24:44.489]  To receive an information packet, call our treatment center at 501-255
[01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:47.991]  Take a look out your window there.
[01:24:48.171 --> 01:24:50.113]  There's a scene you like to catch.
[01:25:14.198 --> 01:25:17.742]  Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'll like to catch.
[01:25:18.763 --> 01:25:22.767]  Fendi's playing Dixie, man got his hand outstretched.
[01:25:23.027 --> 01:25:26.491]  Could be the viola, could be the lute.
[01:25:41.656 --> 01:25:47.181]  Alright, our guests will be with us for another ten minutes of the Madovich News Blitz, then into the end of the show for everybody.
[01:25:49.883 --> 01:25:57.870]  Sheriff Frank, we were talking during the break, get more into how you would expand the posse, how you would form the constitutional posse.
[01:25:57.910 --> 01:26:07.718]  I mean, imagine the idea of the government against the people, spying on us, versus sheriffs who are elected, saying no to the feds, no to tyranny, and not squeezing the public.
[01:26:08.178 --> 01:26:10.840]  And that's why they've been moving to block the sheriffs, get rid of the sheriffs.
[01:26:11.201 --> 01:26:12.261]  And we still have avenues.
[01:26:12.301 --> 01:26:14.063]  The juries, the grand juries, the sheriffs.
[01:26:14.383 --> 01:26:18.146]  There's a lot of other ways that we get to maintain the people's power.
[01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:25.892]  Previously, before the 17th Amendment, federal senators were appointed by the legislatures of the states who voted for the U.S.
[01:26:25.932 --> 01:26:27.834]  Senator and would send them to Washington.
[01:26:27.874 --> 01:26:28.855]  Again, state power.
[01:26:29.395 --> 01:26:31.417]  Everything is moving away from people power.
[01:26:31.997 --> 01:26:33.859]  In Decentralization's hands.
[01:26:33.919 --> 01:26:41.886]  Sheriff Franks, tell us more about your posse, if you're re-elected sheriff, and sheriff previously a few decades ago, here in Travis County.
[01:26:42.566 --> 01:26:59.021]  Well, what I envision, I could draw upon one or two hundred citizens, probably more in precinct three, because it's more populated than precinct four, and in other words, I won't pick them all from one precinct, and indoctrinate them, train them,
[01:27:00.169 --> 01:27:12.418]  Issue them a badge with appropriate credential and have a notification system where one person would notify five others and those five would notify others if needed.
[01:27:13.139 --> 01:27:17.982]  And for fires or wrecks or crime or any of it?
[01:27:18.203 --> 01:27:18.423]  Yeah.
[01:27:19.323 --> 01:27:24.147]  And I'm not talking about the Travis County posse that puts on the rodeo.
[01:27:24.187 --> 01:27:25.788]  I think they still put on a rodeo.
[01:27:25.828 --> 01:27:26.529]  I'm talking about
[01:27:27.129 --> 01:27:27.849]  A real posse.
[01:27:27.889 --> 01:27:30.851]  Yeah, a real posse that's deputizing.
[01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:35.352]  Well, let's say the feds were coming through, taking over the city governments as they've been training to do.
[01:27:35.933 --> 01:27:39.794]  Your sheriff, they come in and say, we're here to arrest thousands of citizens.
[01:27:40.174 --> 01:27:42.795]  Work brigades, the economy's collapsed.
[01:27:44.356 --> 01:27:52.979]  You're telling me that you would, and that's how a whole rebellion nationwide that could start that had government, quote, credentials that could defeat the illegitimate feds.
[01:27:53.019 --> 01:27:54.600]  Imagine having thousands
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:09.945]  Well, they're going to have to deal with my full-time deputy sheriffs who's going to be well trained on what to do and when to do it.
[01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:18.628]  And that's number one, plus my other one or two hundred people that I'm going to deputize and have ready to respond to such a
[01:28:19.488 --> 01:28:20.048]  Well, I think that
[01:28:46.238 --> 01:29:02.206]  This is a time when they're bringing in the military now into the country to overthrow the county sheriffs and put us under martial law that Sheriff Franks ought to get a couple thousand citizens.
[01:29:02.446 --> 01:29:11.030]  And I want to tell you, too, that in Phoenix, when we had that 3,000 sheriff's posse, there was many good ladies there, too, on the sheriff's posse.
[01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:13.811]  Matter of fact, my wife is a perfect example.
[01:29:13.831 --> 01:29:14.451]  22 years in the Army.
[01:29:16.107 --> 01:29:19.549]  And she's a better sniper than I am with her .308 rifle.
[01:29:19.789 --> 01:29:23.071]  And so there's a lot of things that the women can do.
[01:29:24.112 --> 01:29:25.753]  Some women can do better than the men.
[01:29:25.853 --> 01:29:26.173]  Absolutely.
[01:29:26.213 --> 01:29:27.374]  Let's go back to martial law.
[01:29:27.414 --> 01:29:29.015]  Don't overlook the women either.
[01:29:29.055 --> 01:29:33.858]  For those that don't know, the Army Times, the News, Glenn Beck, they're all announcing the troops are here.
[01:29:33.918 --> 01:29:36.880]  Glenn Beck says they may need to be used to arrest 9-11 truthers.
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:38.881]  Jack, your comments on that?
[01:29:40.202 --> 01:29:47.589]  Well, I think, uh, all this falls in the category of the Sheriff's powers, duties, and responsibilities and jurisdiction.
[01:29:48.310 --> 01:30:04.425]  And, uh, so if they, if these people do not have due process and they are truly constitutionalist and within the first amendment to protest or speak out and there, and the feds are trying to arrest them, the Sheriff is supposed to stop that.
[01:30:05.331 --> 01:30:19.052]  Uh, because he is the protector of the people and he is the person that, uh, like when I was in the Vietnam War, I took the oath and I took it again as a Phoenix police detective or, uh, investigator.
[01:30:19.901 --> 01:30:22.862]  And it was to defend the Constitution.
[01:30:22.882 --> 01:30:32.226]  By the way, Jack, as you know, there have been thousands of cases of the Pinkerton security in the last 150 years and through the Depression and other private security firms.
[01:30:32.246 --> 01:30:39.890]  People see that in Westerns when the bad railroad enforcers come and kill people in the town and take mines and property and water rights.
[01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:44.872]  There were thousands of cases where sheriffs would call up a posse and run their butt out of town.
[01:30:45.652 --> 01:30:50.956]  And so people can't imagine, and I mean the last 50 years folks, people can't imagine a sheriff doing that.
[01:30:51.416 --> 01:30:53.437]  No, I mean, that's what this country was built on.
[01:30:55.238 --> 01:30:56.699]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:30:56.719 --> 01:31:00.101]  And now we're so domesticated that it's an alien thought.
[01:31:01.222 --> 01:31:11.629]  Well, we've been brainwashed into believing that the feds can come in and do anything they want, and many of the sheriffs have been brainwashed that way too.
[01:31:12.578 --> 01:31:23.949]  But I can tell you of some sheriffs that one went to his grave hating himself because he was the sheriff that allowed Waco to happen in his county.
[01:31:24.029 --> 01:31:25.731]  That's right, he spoke out against that.
[01:31:25.911 --> 01:31:28.974]  He could have gone in and arrested David Koresh.
[01:31:29.074 --> 01:31:30.415]  Oh, you knew the McClellan County?
[01:31:30.455 --> 01:31:33.318]  He was elected in 1972, the same year that I was.
[01:31:36.801 --> 01:31:39.022]  Yeah, and he hated himself.
[01:31:39.142 --> 01:31:46.185]  He hated himself for letting the feds come in and start that fire and burn up the children and moms and dads.
[01:31:46.265 --> 01:31:58.270]  And then he knew of the machine gun nest out back because the FLIR radar picked him up machine gunning the people that ran out to the building back there to try to get away from the fire.
[01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:02.584]  And he truly went to his grave hating himself.
[01:32:02.604 --> 01:32:04.085]  No, he said that on TV.
[01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:06.247]  He was really upset about that.
[01:32:06.267 --> 01:32:08.169]  He said they could pick Koresh up any time in town.
[01:32:08.929 --> 01:32:13.694]  But they wanted to go in there and burn out a quote cult to sell the public on accepting it.
[01:32:14.314 --> 01:32:17.777]  Well, Jack McClam, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:32:17.797 --> 01:32:20.700]  What, your program's on Genesis Communications at 7 o'clock Central?
[01:32:22.881 --> 01:32:27.304]  Yes it is.
[01:32:27.905 --> 01:32:34.209]  Once again I just want to say thank you Alex for having Sheriff Franks on because he's my hero.
[01:32:34.509 --> 01:32:41.794]  These guys are my hero and God bless you Sheriff and I hope that you're re-elected and the people have a
[01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:45.804]  A protector there and a champion like yourself.
[01:32:46.064 --> 01:32:46.904]  Well, thank you, Jack.
[01:32:46.944 --> 01:32:48.205]  I appreciate that very much.
[01:32:48.746 --> 01:32:49.106]  Okay.
[01:32:58.593 --> 01:32:59.773]  Yeah, I know he is.
[01:32:59.793 --> 01:33:04.455]  And it's just great to have him joining us on the show today.
[01:33:04.635 --> 01:33:14.418]  An interesting now hour and about 30 minute discussion on the role of the sheriff, the role of the counties, the true role of state government, and a lot of what's happened there.
[01:33:14.438 --> 01:33:15.538]  I want to give you the website.
[01:33:15.578 --> 01:33:17.338]  It's RaymondFrank.com.
[01:33:18.339 --> 01:33:25.781]  And even if you live outside Travis County, I know a small part of our huge audience is in the county here, birthplace of Texas.
[01:33:26.835 --> 01:33:27.216]  See you next
[01:33:45.393 --> 01:33:48.014]  Are there other ways for them to volunteer or get involved?
[01:33:48.054 --> 01:33:48.935]  I see a phone number here.
[01:33:48.955 --> 01:33:50.075]  Do you want me to give that number out?
[01:33:50.395 --> 01:33:51.996]  Yes, that's my home telephone number.
[01:33:52.776 --> 01:33:55.998]  Alright, it's 512, but in Austin you don't need the 512 as you know.
[01:33:56.018 --> 01:33:56.058]  327-2034.
[01:33:56.078 --> 01:33:56.098]  327-2034.
[01:34:03.107 --> 01:34:06.890]  And RaymondFrank.com, 327-2034.
[01:34:08.131 --> 01:34:13.136]  Give him a call if you want to volunteer or help the former Travis County Sheriff out.
[01:34:14.076 --> 01:34:16.078]  Again, he was Special Agent Lieutenant Colonel with the U.S.
[01:34:16.118 --> 01:34:18.540]  Air Force Office of Special Investigation for 15 years.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:25.005]  Assignments in Berlin, Paris, London, and all over the world, Iceland, Germany, South Central Texas.
[01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:29.028]  And then he was elected sheriff in Travis County for eight years and friends with Willie Nelson.
[01:34:29.048 --> 01:34:29.688]  I didn't even know that.
[01:34:30.208 --> 01:34:30.848]  And a listener.
[01:34:30.868 --> 01:34:32.829]  How long have you been listening to this show, Sheriff?
[01:34:33.630 --> 01:34:34.810]  For a long, long time.
[01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:36.491]  When did you first pick it up?
[01:34:36.511 --> 01:34:37.791]  Back in the mid-90s?
[01:34:38.152 --> 01:34:39.352]  Yeah, it was, yeah.
[01:34:39.772 --> 01:34:43.294]  When you would go through a lot of different phonetics and so forth, yeah.
[01:34:44.254 --> 01:34:45.795]  Oh, the TV show, right, yeah.
[01:34:46.295 --> 01:34:49.377]  Yeah, it's been a long time and I've really enjoyed it and I still listen.
[01:34:50.433 --> 01:34:55.196]  I still blow up and yell and scream a little, but I kind of had the edges off me, you know?
[01:34:55.216 --> 01:34:59.138]  Working so much, you kind of just get a little bit more relaxed, usually, unless you're talking to an enemy.
[01:34:59.899 --> 01:35:01.500]  Then I still get fired up talking to them.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:05.482]  You have the Air Force's highest aeronautical rating of command pilot with 3,600 hours.
[01:35:05.522 --> 01:35:06.843]  And is this one of the planes you flew?
[01:35:09.625 --> 01:35:15.669]  Yeah, that was my first combat-ready airplane, the P-61 Black Widow, the Night Fighter.
[01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:20.373]  We had three of us crew members, a pilot, radar observer, and a gunner.
[01:35:21.574 --> 01:35:22.735]  It was a beautiful airplane.
[01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:25.717]  And then you flew some other aircraft, didn't you?
[01:35:26.257 --> 01:35:31.061]  Oh yeah, like most Air Force pilots, we've flown a lot of different aircraft.
[01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:32.934]  Here, I'll put this up on screen.
[01:35:32.974 --> 01:35:33.615]  I'll show people.
[01:35:33.935 --> 01:35:35.096]  Go to the site and find it.
[01:35:35.757 --> 01:35:36.778]  Go ahead and punch this up for me.
[01:35:36.798 --> 01:35:42.323]  I want to show folks the young Raymond Frank there in his Lieutenant Colonel uniform.
[01:35:42.943 --> 01:35:44.505]  I got my wings when I was 19.
[01:35:44.545 --> 01:35:48.449]  That's what that picture was taking way back there.
[01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:55.135]  I'm going to put it up on screen for people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv if we can punch my camera up.
[01:35:56.988 --> 01:35:59.432]  Tell us a little bit about your Air Force career.
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:24.909]  In 1943, went through pilot training, got my wingsuit when I was 19, went overseas, had my choice to stay in Japan and fly P-51s or go over to Korea and fly P-38s.
[01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:30.293]  I chose Japan, and I'm glad I did because I later went to Korea during the Korean War.
[01:36:32.395 --> 01:36:40.961]  But then later, I decided I needed to learn something besides flying, and I became a special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.
[01:36:42.112 --> 01:36:57.697]  The only problem was I was a captain, a major, and you wind up behind a desk while the younger people in the lesser rank go out and do the intelligence work and counterintelligence work.
[01:36:57.897 --> 01:37:00.037]  And here you are pinning a medal on a lovely young lady.
[01:37:00.077 --> 01:37:00.517]  Who's that?
[01:37:00.777 --> 01:37:01.918]  That's my daughter, Brenda.
[01:37:01.938 --> 01:37:06.139]  She was an Air Force lieutenant graduate.
[01:37:06.219 --> 01:37:09.680]  Her initial assignment was an aircraft maintenance officer at Dover, Delaware.
[01:37:12.168 --> 01:37:14.471]  I taught her how to change oil in a Volkswagen.
[01:37:15.212 --> 01:37:16.253]  What was Korea like?
[01:37:16.293 --> 01:37:18.896]  What were you doing over there?
[01:37:19.136 --> 01:37:23.542]  I'd been married one month, went overseas to Korea.
[01:37:23.602 --> 01:37:25.184]  Went to Kimpo Air Base.
[01:37:25.264 --> 01:37:26.385]  I was there about two weeks.
[01:37:26.886 --> 01:37:29.629]  The Chinese were coming south, so we evacuated.
[01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:33.591]  About 24 hours before they got there and went back to Japan.
[01:37:34.111 --> 01:37:36.792]  I stayed over for that thing for about 8 months.
[01:37:37.212 --> 01:37:39.253]  What kind of missions did you fly during that?
[01:37:39.873 --> 01:37:42.134]  The F-82s and F-84s.
[01:37:42.274 --> 01:37:42.934]  What were you doing?
[01:37:43.815 --> 01:37:44.735]  What kind of missions?
[01:37:45.255 --> 01:37:49.757]  Well, looking for big, mega aircraft to shoot down and so forth.
[01:37:50.857 --> 01:37:51.757]  That never happened to me.
[01:37:51.797 --> 01:37:55.318]  I didn't get a chance, but some people did, not many of them.
[01:37:56.579 --> 01:37:59.620]  So you were basically hunting around to direct other aircraft?
[01:38:00.202 --> 01:38:08.868]  Well, flying up near the Yellow River and where we could encounter the enemy and take care of them in the appropriate manner.
[01:38:10.489 --> 01:38:12.811]  And then, what did you do during the Vietnam era?
[01:38:14.771 --> 01:38:20.672]  I was a special agent with the Air Force in London, and Wiesbaden, Germany, and Berlin.
[01:38:21.372 --> 01:38:22.473]  Different places like that.
[01:38:23.313 --> 01:38:24.073]  Pretty exciting.
[01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:26.994]  Berlin was considered the spook capital of the world.
[01:38:27.014 --> 01:38:30.534]  A lot of agents there, counterintelligence agents.
[01:38:30.674 --> 01:38:33.235]  Did you ever run into E. Howard Hunt?
[01:38:33.275 --> 01:38:34.195]  He was over there at that time.
[01:38:34.415 --> 01:38:35.175]  No, I didn't.
[01:38:35.355 --> 01:38:38.376]  I know about him, and I know his background, but I never did.
[01:38:39.358 --> 01:38:39.758]  All right.
[01:38:40.319 --> 01:38:42.380]  Well, again, I hope people will call.
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.521]  I hope they'll get involved.
[01:38:43.761 --> 01:38:50.885]  And we know there's a lot of election fraud, but we're going to have Vote Rescue Austin, Vicki Carp, out doing a great job watching all of that and tracking that.
[01:38:51.065 --> 01:38:53.687]  And regardless, we need a big showing for Sheriff Raymond Frank.
[01:38:54.107 --> 01:38:56.529]  Tell everybody you want a chance at having a really great sheriff.
[01:38:56.549 --> 01:38:58.770]  Let me tell you, he's as good as they come.
[01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.711]  We need him.
[01:38:59.751 --> 01:39:01.152]  Does he have your vote, Paul?
[01:39:02.253 --> 01:39:03.154]  He does have you.
[01:39:03.174 --> 01:39:08.558]  Okay, Paul out there, our IT guy, also running the Prison Planet broadcast transmission.
[01:39:08.919 --> 01:39:09.579]  He's all for you.
[01:39:09.979 --> 01:39:11.000]  Sheriff, thanks for coming in.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:11.801]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:39:11.841 --> 01:39:16.024]  I really enjoyed it, and to the citizens, I have a very good chance of winning.
[01:39:16.124 --> 01:39:18.767]  All they need to do is get out there and vote on the 20th absentee.
[01:39:18.787 --> 01:39:24.011]  Yeah, they're a very small turnout for the Sheriff, and if our listeners get involved now, I just should have had you on earlier.
[01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.312]  Well, I think it's
[01:39:27.139 --> 01:39:29.141]  What you're doing is, I really appreciate it.
[01:39:29.402 --> 01:39:30.283]  It's going to help a lot.
[01:39:30.623 --> 01:39:31.744]  Alright, good to see you my friend.
[01:39:31.845 --> 01:39:32.185]  Thank you.
[01:39:32.205 --> 01:39:33.687]  Hey Kerr, what a great guy.
[01:39:33.707 --> 01:39:36.830]  I had a chance to meet him and his wife one time.
[01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:39.974]  I went out and visited him in his house and he is just a great guy.
[01:39:40.014 --> 01:39:40.574]  Thank you Sheriff.
[01:39:41.923 --> 01:39:44.085]  Oh boy, so much going on.
[01:39:44.125 --> 01:39:50.090]  That was a great hour and a half plus with Raymond Frank, Red Beckman, and Jack McClam.
[01:39:50.650 --> 01:40:02.380]  You know, we could focus all day on the economy, and we have been doing show after show after show after show on that subject in great detail, and we will continue to do that throughout the week.
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:10.506]  We've got the guys from the Money Masters on with us tomorrow to get into how the private central banks are engineering all of this by design.
[01:40:11.894 --> 01:40:16.529]  I want to cover some financial news now here right at the end of the final segment when we come back, but before I do that...
[01:40:17.694 --> 01:40:29.502]  You know, I spent over an hour today going after Zeitgeist Addendum, because I was saying, oh, I think you're a good guy, oh, I think you're film, I disagree with quite a bit of it, the utopia, withering away of the state, and, you know, gun disarmament and all of this.
[01:40:30.663 --> 01:40:35.966]  But I said, you know, I know you're bashing Christians and religion, you know, and that doesn't exist, and is hokey superstition.
[01:40:36.386 --> 01:40:39.769]  But I said, you know, I think you should, you know, widen your horizons a bit.
[01:40:40.289 --> 01:40:47.374]  But then I went and looked into it more and found out that it's very occultic, tied into the Theosophic Society, the UN,
[01:40:48.475 --> 01:41:03.745]  I cover that in part of the first hour and then into the second hour today, and if you didn't hear that on the AM and FM dial during this show, or on shortwave or satellite, it's all going to re-air in about 12 minutes at InfoWars.com on the audio streams.
[01:41:03.765 --> 01:41:16.154]  Let me tell you, this thing is very popular in the Liberty and Awakening movement, and I would love to say it was good and it was happy and it was friendly, but I'm glad that I started looking into it more and found what I found, because
[01:41:17.414 --> 01:41:18.274]  They have the U.N.
[01:41:18.355 --> 01:41:22.616]  Christ, the world government Christ, who the U.N.
[01:41:22.896 --> 01:41:29.058]  and the Theosophic Society believes is the world government Christ.
[01:41:29.638 --> 01:41:34.660]  Intros and outros of the film, and they talk about the God Spirit and all the stuff in us.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:38.921]  So see, they're saying we're all religious coots when I'm not even debating them about bashing Christians.
[01:41:39.301 --> 01:41:40.402]  I'm not even engaging there.
[01:41:40.962 --> 01:41:50.364]  I'm like, what about all this about world government and re-education and all this on a good world government and saying the private banks are free market and the scam they're running is free market when it's not?
[01:41:51.525 --> 01:41:52.925]  And it's like, oh, you just aren't smart.
[01:41:52.945 --> 01:41:54.085]  You're just a lowly Christian.
[01:41:54.125 --> 01:41:54.966]  You just don't know.
[01:41:55.026 --> 01:41:56.026]  You just don't understand.
[01:41:56.066 --> 01:41:58.526]  You just can't even quite, you know, it's too advanced for you to understand.
[01:41:58.566 --> 01:41:59.007]  I'm like, no!
[01:41:59.287 --> 01:42:01.447]  I've seen this for 150 years out of the New World Order.
[01:42:02.107 --> 01:42:03.808]  And then I went and researched it more.
[01:42:04.568 --> 01:42:05.648]  And I mean, just for two hours.
[01:42:06.128 --> 01:42:07.789]  And that was researching about the first 20 minutes.
[01:42:09.048 --> 01:42:12.370]  It would take months to research every bit of it.
[01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:18.313]  Every door I knock down, it's just like the stench of New World Order is just absolutely off the charts.
[01:42:19.674 --> 01:42:23.336]  Before we end this segment, I want to tell you about one of our fine sponsors.
[01:42:23.376 --> 01:42:24.436]  That's Okolo Blue.
[01:42:24.456 --> 01:42:25.497]  Okolo Blue.
[01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:28.979]  Great atmospheric water generator.
[01:42:28.999 --> 01:42:32.861]  Grabs 7.5 gallons on average a day out of the air.
[01:42:34.196 --> 01:42:42.262]  And distills it, then it goes through five filters, reverse osmosis, UV light, on and on and on.
[01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:44.863]  Check out more at E-C-O-L-O-Blue.com.

[01:42:51.868 --> 01:42:52.168]  1-866-585-4044.
[01:42:52.588 --> 01:42:54.870]  Ecolablue.com.
[01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:56.691]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[01:42:57.031 --> 01:43:00.174]  If you forget the web address, there's a link up on Infowars.com.
[01:43:03.266 --> 01:43:07.549]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:12.693]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:43:12.893 --> 01:43:14.234]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:43:14.415 --> 01:43:17.897]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:43:18.017 --> 01:43:23.181]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:43:23.421 --> 01:43:29.206]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:43:29.526 --> 01:43:31.947]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:43:32.047 --> 01:43:34.348]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[01:43:34.568 --> 01:43:36.709]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.

[01:43:38.189 --> 01:43:39.130]  No animal testing.
[01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:40.690]  I use them and love them.
[01:43:40.710 --> 01:43:42.311]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:43:42.611 --> 01:43:43.692]  And I say big time.
[01:43:44.012 --> 01:43:45.592]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:43:45.732 --> 01:43:46.072]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[01:43:55.496 --> 01:44:01.998]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:44:02.959 --> 01:44:04.619]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:08.321]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:44:08.541 --> 01:44:10.422]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:44:11.002 --> 01:44:13.723]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:44:14.043 --> 01:44:19.365]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:44:19.765 --> 01:44:23.668]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:44:49.745 --> 01:44:50.847]  We're good to go.
[01:45:04.844 --> 01:45:05.004]  I think?
[01:45:19.824 --> 01:45:20.264]  We're good to go!
[01:45:41.562 --> 01:45:42.683]  Now, what can you do to prepare?
[01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:43.523]  Do what I did.
[01:45:43.703 --> 01:45:45.184]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[01:45:45.284 --> 01:45:47.966]  Go to the J. Michael Stephens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[01:45:48.066 --> 01:45:49.867]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.
[01:45:49.947 --> 01:45:51.388]  Put a little security in your life.
[01:45:51.528 --> 01:45:52.608]  You deserve security.
[01:45:52.688 --> 01:45:53.669]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:45:53.689 --> 01:45:54.309]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:45:54.329 --> 01:45:54.409]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:45:54.429 --> 01:45:55.090]  Put some food away.
[01:45:55.110 --> 01:45:55.590]  Do it now.
[01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:55.670]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:46:11.829 --> 01:46:20.377]  There are more than 360 comments in an article I posted written by Chris White up on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:21.278 --> 01:46:24.722]  Sight, guise, tooth, Theosophy, Socialism, and the New World Order.
[01:46:24.742 --> 01:46:29.026]  In the rebroadcast on the web I've detailed just some of the hires we found.
[01:46:29.046 --> 01:46:35.832]  So I need to go back and say I thought they were nice guys and were just misguided in some ways using the hook of 9-11 and the banking system.
[01:46:36.653 --> 01:46:39.478]  And the implication they're on there right now saying, oh, you're here for the banking system.
[01:46:39.498 --> 01:46:40.239]  No, it's a fraud.
[01:46:40.319 --> 01:46:41.240]  It's not free market.
[01:46:41.841 --> 01:46:42.923]  I mean, look, I'm sorry.
[01:46:43.203 --> 01:46:44.886]  It's total Illuminati brainwashing.
[01:46:45.427 --> 01:46:47.350]  And I'm going to counter it.
[01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.971]  It's over.
[01:46:48.732 --> 01:46:49.934]  Sorry, gloves are off now.
[01:46:50.414 --> 01:46:50.835]  Get ready.
[01:46:51.843 --> 01:46:53.064]  Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:53.945 --> 01:46:56.027]  All right, I want to tell you about two other quick sponsors.
[01:46:56.067 --> 01:46:59.250]  I'm going to hit some financial, final financial news.
[01:46:59.431 --> 01:47:04.355]  Obviously, efoodsdirect.com, the best long-term storable foods company.
[01:47:05.356 --> 01:47:07.158]  They are the longest continually operating.
[01:47:07.198 --> 01:47:07.839]  Great folks.
[01:47:07.959 --> 01:47:09.420]  Freeze-dried and dehydrated.
[01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:11.863]  Stores for more than 10 years in climate control.
[01:47:12.083 --> 01:47:13.164]  10 years in your attic or
[01:47:14.486 --> 01:47:20.975]  Uh, unclimate controlled area like your garage, you know where I'm keeping mine, I don't have room in the house, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:47:20.995 --> 01:47:22.758]  With everything happening, you're insane if you don't get prepared.
[01:47:30.489 --> 01:47:32.570]  And then, of course, just a huge sponsor.
[01:47:32.590 --> 01:47:34.631]  We're so proud to have NewVitality.com.
[01:47:35.051 --> 01:47:42.774]  Again, another mainline vitamin and mineral company that only has well-researched vitamins and minerals and other herbs that are known to have nutritive effects.
[01:47:43.214 --> 01:47:50.076]  Things like their high-powered 30 ingredients, but the main one is concentrated aloe vera, aloes, colon, and body cleanse.
[01:47:50.836 --> 01:47:51.777]  Call and check into that 1-800-569-4056.
[01:47:51.797 --> 01:47:51.917]  1-800-569-4056.
[01:47:51.957 --> 01:47:52.697]  Or Super Beta Prostate.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:10.091]  Men over 40, 45 really need to be taking salt palm meadow, but this is a bunch of other herbs known, even medically proven, to have a lot of really good effects on the prostate.
[01:48:10.111 --> 01:48:10.451]  1-800-569-4856.
[01:48:10.831 --> 01:48:14.595]  Super, beta, prostate, or the website newvitality.com.
[01:48:14.615 --> 01:48:16.777]  They have hundreds of great products there.
[01:48:18.388 --> 01:48:32.096]  Okay, man, I got to a lot of financial news right at the start of the show, but then I got off into zeitgeist addendum, which I shouldn't even have talked about until I'd deeply researched it, and now I did a little bit more.
[01:48:32.116 --> 01:48:33.157]  My God, is it horrible.
[01:48:34.097 --> 01:48:35.158]  Very, very hardcore.
[01:48:35.198 --> 01:48:36.118]  Very, very serious.
[01:48:36.719 --> 01:48:39.761]  And again, if you don't know, you'll find out coming up in the next hour.
[01:48:40.701 --> 01:48:43.823]  I know I'm a feeble brain, and I love people who are feeble brains.
[01:48:43.843 --> 01:48:45.243]  You can't even consider what we're saying.
[01:48:45.724 --> 01:48:51.046]  You're bashing all these religions, and in your theophic society, Messiah is the one in the movie.
[01:48:51.887 --> 01:48:57.369]  Global messiahs, global governments, re-education, eradicating the classes.
[01:48:57.450 --> 01:48:59.370]  Alright, I'm already getting off into it.
[01:48:59.410 --> 01:49:02.192]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[01:49:06.044 --> 01:49:11.310]  But on the subject of the economy... Oh, by the way, we just have some huge guests coming up next week.
[01:49:11.410 --> 01:49:12.291]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:49:13.012 --> 01:49:15.315]  You're going to hear some really big guests on this show.
[01:49:15.675 --> 01:49:16.436]  What's up, Paul?
[01:49:17.097 --> 01:49:17.637]  Paul's smiling.
[01:49:17.657 --> 01:49:18.398]  He's excited, too.
[01:49:18.959 --> 01:49:20.901]  Everybody knows when I say huge guests, I mean it.
[01:49:21.382 --> 01:49:24.966]  Some really big guests next week, and we'll continue to track everything that's happening.
[01:49:24.986 --> 01:49:26.427]  I have so much Zeitgeist stuff in here.
[01:49:27.108 --> 01:49:28.929]  I'm digging around looking for my financial stuff.
[01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:33.012]  Great story from Infowars.net by Steve Watson.
[01:49:33.052 --> 01:49:42.819]  Total bailout cost heads towards $5 trillion already, and then he lists the $5 trillion bailout, as we told you three weeks ago, but now detailed.
[01:49:43.259 --> 01:49:45.881]  We've already spent over $2 trillion of the $5 trillion.
[01:49:46.442 --> 01:49:49.184]  Dow Jones bloodbath mirroring 1929.
[01:49:49.564 --> 01:49:54.267]  Bottom should be around 27% lower than it is now.
[01:49:54.708 --> 01:49:56.109]  That's just coming out of CNBC.
[01:49:57.029 --> 01:49:57.990]  Reports there.
[01:49:59.611 --> 01:50:03.174]  Great report from Henry Macau.
[01:50:03.494 --> 01:50:06.316]  Illuminati bankers seek revolution by economic means.
[01:50:06.336 --> 01:50:10.039]  We're going to have depression and hyperinflation.
[01:50:10.099 --> 01:50:12.481]  A great story here from George Washington blog.
[01:50:12.801 --> 01:50:17.104]  Fire or ice, are we headed towards hyperinflation or deflation?
[01:50:17.885 --> 01:50:18.886]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.407]  They can prop the stock market up, and I doubt they'll be able to do that.
[01:50:23.047 --> 01:50:26.347]  The point is, the hyperinflation is what is going to be devastating.
[01:50:27.408 --> 01:50:29.008]  Oh, and they've killed No.
[01:50:29.028 --> 01:50:33.089]  2 in Al Qaeda for the third time, but they're not retracting any of the other killings of him before.
[01:50:33.569 --> 01:50:34.969]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:34.989 --> 01:50:35.709]  We're out of time.
[01:50:36.089 --> 01:50:37.450]  That's it for the live transmission.
[01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:39.770]  Great job to the crew, the sponsors, the affiliates.
[01:50:40.530 --> 01:50:42.811]  We'll be back on the web right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:43.914 --> 01:50:47.517]  Oh, and by the way, for web listeners, I'm going to keep going a little bit here.
[01:50:47.737 --> 01:50:51.800]  John, we now have the free archives up on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:56.983]  You can listen to how you want, when you want, not just by subscribing to the podcast, but we've got about a month up there so far.
[01:50:57.003 --> 01:50:59.685]  We're going to post like three years backdated up there.
[01:51:00.086 --> 01:51:03.168]  We have to laboriously go through and do that, so that's happening as well.
[01:51:03.668 --> 01:51:04.409]  Okay, that's it.
[01:51:04.449 --> 01:51:06.590]  Even on the internet stream, we will now leave you.
[01:51:06.650 --> 01:51:07.391]  God bless you all.
[01:51:09.352 --> 01:51:09.913]  Good job, John.
[01:51:09.953 --> 01:51:10.513]  I'll see you, pal.
[01:51:11.194 --> 01:51:11.834]  Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow.
