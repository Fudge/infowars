[00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:26.498]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:29.375]  On News Radio 590.
[00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.607]  Behind our back, USA Radio News.
[00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:36.647]  I'm Pete LaValle.
[00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:42.729]  The President-Elect is working to choose a cabinet that is diverse, according to his transition chief.
[00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.731]  I think his charge to us is that he wants a broad, diverse cabinet.
[00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:52.453]  One that's built on first criteria is excellence, and that's what we're trying to produce.
[00:00:52.553 --> 00:01:02.536]  John Podesta appeared on Fox News, as did Congressman Eric Cantor, who says House Republicans are willing to work with the Obama administration to get the job done.
[00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:10.998]  I think you will see a Republican Party in Congress serving as a check and a balance against Mr. Obama's power and Speaker Pelosi's power.
[00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:19.901]  Podesta also says the incoming administration is reviewing President Bush's executive orders on stem cell research, oil and gas drilling, and other matters.
[00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:22.542]  Hurricane Paloma is now weakening.
[00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:24.843]  The once powerful storm has lost its punch.
[00:01:24.863 --> 00:01:26.223]  It's now a tropical storm.
[00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:29.024]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.637]  The following from News Broadcast Network.
[00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:43.241]  If you haven't had CPR training for a while, you may be surprised to learn that doctors are now saying you should skip the mouth-to-mouth part of resuscitation in most cases and concentrate on restarting the heart.
[00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:54.946]  Dr. Charles Otto of the University of Arizona College of Medicine told the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, research shows that starting the heart in most cases will allow the person in distress to get some oxygen on his own
[00:01:55.286 --> 00:02:01.873]  One side benefit, Dr. Otto says, more bystanders may be likely to help because people are often less comfortable giving mouth-to-mouth.
[00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:03.375]  John Dridden, Orlando.
[00:02:04.147 --> 00:02:12.611]  To educate our community about breast health and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Yoplait's Safe Lids to Safe Lives campaign, Cheryl Krogh joined forces with Yoplait.
[00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:16.833]  The goal this year is to raise $1.5 million to go to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
[00:02:16.993 --> 00:02:21.855]  Join Cheryl and Yoplait in the fight against breast cancer by mailing in special pink lids from Yoplait Yogurt Cups.
[00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:27.957]  For every pink lid mailed in by December 31, 2008, Yoplait will donate 10 cents to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
[00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:28.998]  I'm Jennifer Mauro.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.401]  A deadly accident on a Russian submarine.
[00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:40.003]  20 people suffocated when a fire extinguishing system aboard a new Russian sub malfunctioned during a test run.
[00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:42.944]  The accident released freon gas.
[00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:46.905]  Correspondent Vladimir Izetchenkov is following the story in Moscow.
[00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:54.709]  There are unconfirmed at this stage reports that the submarine was to be leased by India for 10 years.
[00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.951]  And these trials were actually part of preparation for the lease.
[00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:02.313]  The Russian Navy says the sub itself was not damaged.
[00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:08.136]  The owner of a collapsed school in Haiti is in custody as a desperate search for survivors continues.
[00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:10.558]  At least 88 children are known dead.
[00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:12.018]  Many are still missing.
[00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.900]  The owner is charged with involuntary manslaughter.
[00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:22.233]  There's new evidence that people not normally thought to be at major risk can reduce their chances of a heart attack using a cholesterol drug.

[00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:07.495]  Doctors are treating dozens of cholera cases outside a refugee camp just outside Congo's eastern provincial capital of Goma.
[00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:15.402]  They treated 13 new cases of cholera on Sunday and have seen 45 cases since Friday at the Kibati refugee camp.
[00:04:15.703 --> 00:04:19.026]  They say shortages of water in the Creens make the outbreak dangerous.
[00:04:19.967 --> 00:04:24.571]  Britain is remembering its war dead, including troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:32.157]  The service is held on the nearest Sunday to the anniversary of the end of World War I on November 11, 1918.
[00:04:33.198 --> 00:04:38.443]  Chancellor Angela Merkel has called on Germans to stand together against racism and anti-Semitism.
[00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:51.251]  As that nation marks the 70th anniversary of the Nazi program known as Kristallnacht, or Night of Broken Glass, to mark the anniversary of the Nazi incited riots that killed more than 91 Jews and damaged some 1,000 synagogues.
[00:04:52.862 --> 00:05:00.445]  A female suicide bomber has detonated her explosive vest at a hospital west of Baghdad, killing three people, injuring five others.
[00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:07.989]  Three Indonesian bombers have been executed for helping plan and carry out the 2002 Bali bombings.
[00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.351]  People with pacemakers or other heart devices should be careful with headphones from portable music players.
[00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:22.255]  The study presented at an American Heart Association conference finds that some headphones can interfere with heart devices if held too close to them.
[00:05:23.127 --> 00:05:24.068]  I'm Pete LaValle.
[00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:28.950]  You've been listening to IRN USA Radio News.
[00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:34.492]  Are you one of the people who think, I have plenty of time, nothing's ever going to happen bad to me?
[00:05:34.613 --> 00:05:39.935]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:42.796]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?
[00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:45.638]  This is Kurt, the armchair survivalist, heard on this network.
[00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:48.299]  Survival Enterprises sells real food, canned for long

[00:07:21.663 --> 00:07:22.623]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:07:23.384 --> 00:07:24.224]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:27.846]  We'll be live here for the Sunday, abbreviated edition, than I do.
[00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:33.289]  I'm on the air six days a week, but if you're Friday, then I come back in on Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:35.130]  Central Standard Time.
[00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:46.214]  I want to take a ton of phone calls today on the economy, on Barack Obama, on where you think this country is headed in the future.
[00:07:46.294 --> 00:07:58.423]  Are you happy with the direction that Barack Obama, the 44th president, now president-elect, moving quickly into the presidential role, the radio addresses and press conferences.
[00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:00.725]  Are you happy with what he is doing?
[00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.736]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525.
[00:08:06.196 --> 00:08:13.797]  And if those lines fill up, you can always call, if you're listening in Texas, 836-0590.
[00:08:13.957 --> 00:08:28.180]  I want to go over Barack Obama and who he really is and what he really stands for, but this has to be done delicately or it only empowers the globalists, only empowers the New World Order.
[00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:32.357]  through this psychological trap that they've set up.
[00:08:33.298 --> 00:08:37.601]  Then I want to get into the Denver Post reporting what we told you two months ago.
[00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:44.245]  When I was in Denver we witnessed police staged posing as demonstrators.
[00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:49.368]  We talked to witnesses who had seen police posing as demonstrators trying to stir up trouble.
[00:08:50.749 --> 00:08:56.193]  Now the police have been forced to admit now that they did stage attacks on other police
[00:08:58.164 --> 00:09:00.946]  As a pretext to be able to attack the peaceful crowds.
[00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:06.830]  Now, we've caught them in Seattle, we've caught them in D.C., we've caught them in Austin, Texas doing this.
[00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.473]  We've caught them in other countries, in Italy and Canada.
[00:09:13.334 --> 00:09:16.036]  Well, they've now been caught in Denver doing this.
[00:09:17.617 --> 00:09:18.758]  And the police admit they did it.
[00:09:20.039 --> 00:09:23.881]  Do you understand there's a whole world that the general public is not made privy to?
[00:09:25.362 --> 00:09:25.983]  If police
[00:09:27.717 --> 00:09:33.140]  Well, why would police go out and attack their own police as a pretext to demonize demonstrators?
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.083]  What does that tell you about major metropolitan police departments' mindset?
[00:09:41.344 --> 00:09:46.987]  Well, I mean, we've seen cases every few weeks about major police departments framing people.
[00:09:47.728 --> 00:09:48.688]  It's institutionalized.
[00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:52.190]  It's not one bad cop in the crime lab that frames people in Houston.
[00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.912]  It was over 4,000 people framed and they were ordered to.
[00:09:56.624 --> 00:10:00.205]  That came out and was barely a blurb two years ago in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:06.267]  In Dallas, they like your car, they pull it over, they throw a bag of chalk in the back, they take your car.
[00:10:06.327 --> 00:10:07.267]  No judge, no jury.
[00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:09.167]  It's asset forfeiture seizure.
[00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:12.088]  There's no Bill of Rights, no due process, no Constitution.
[00:10:13.108 --> 00:10:13.709]  And they don't care.
[00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:25.632]  And I had a police officer call me on Friday's show, and I actually, in hindsight, I know who the guy was because he said his name, and then I was
[00:10:26.303 --> 00:10:36.489]  Googled him in Oyad, heard about him as a police detective in New Jersey, who was involved on 9-11, responding, and you know, he's had Richard Gage and Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth and to Speak.
[00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:43.053]  And he said, you know, I get police to tune into your show and tell them that they need to hear this information, and then you're bashing them.
[00:10:43.433 --> 00:10:50.777]  Hey man, I mean, if cops are attacking other cops and blaming it on the American people, I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say it's a good thing.
[00:10:52.238 --> 00:10:52.878]  I'm tired of it.
[00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:55.480]  I grew up in Rockwall, Texas, knowing the police dealt the drugs and
[00:10:56.227 --> 00:10:59.771]  Sure enough, later the sheriff, Jack McWhorter, went to prison for it.
[00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:04.777]  I mean, I'm not going to live in la-la land.
[00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:06.378]  I'm going to live in the real world.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:17.491]  I'm not against a cop living in his house with his wife and children or husband and children living their life, you know, out writing tickets or responding to burglaries or house alarms.
[00:11:18.348 --> 00:11:22.709]  But, you know, I've had Austin cops come up and tell me, we're gonna arrest you if you don't stop protesting on the street corner.
[00:11:22.729 --> 00:11:26.230]  And I've had to say, well, I'm gonna sue you then and make them back off.
[00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.011]  And I've seen them arrest people in wheelchairs protesting out front of the governor's mansion.
[00:11:30.932 --> 00:11:33.152]  You know, for handicapped rights or whatever.
[00:11:33.852 --> 00:11:34.933]  You know, I'm an American.
[00:11:34.973 --> 00:11:35.733]  I'm a human being.
[00:11:35.813 --> 00:11:36.573]  I've got rights.
[00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.413]  I've got a soul.
[00:11:37.433 --> 00:11:38.354]  I have value.
[00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.894]  And I don't want to fight with you mindlessly.
[00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:43.815]  But I know the government itself is corrupt and evil.
[00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:46.336]  State, federal, international.
[00:11:47.242 --> 00:11:49.923]  I mean, evidenced by this banker takeover known as the bailout.
[00:11:51.123 --> 00:11:53.483]  Over a trillion bucks has already been handed out directly to banks.
[00:11:53.543 --> 00:12:00.445]  It's being used as bonuses and to buy banks and other financial institutions, banks that are in good shape.
[00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:08.066]  There's a major Texas bank based in Houston that's going to be announcing it was bought Monday.
[00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:11.247]  I'll give you a hint, it has a founding father in its name.
[00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:15.508]  And that bank is in really good shape, I happen to know.
[00:12:16.874 --> 00:12:19.376]  Well, I'll just say I know some of the governors of the bank.
[00:12:19.937 --> 00:12:28.144]  And the point is, that's one of the healthiest banks in Texas, so it's being bought with the bailout money by one of the big four international banks.
[00:12:29.806 --> 00:12:30.867]  Now, let me explain something.
[00:12:30.887 --> 00:12:32.628]  You're going to pay for that money in tax money.
[00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:35.571]  And you're going to pay through inflation.
[00:12:36.972 --> 00:12:37.913]  That is a heist.
[00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:39.034]  This is a robbery.
[00:12:40.315 --> 00:12:42.477]  This is a crime going on.
[00:12:43.453 --> 00:12:47.274]  And it tells me if government will do things like this, which our government's never done anything like this.
[00:12:47.294 --> 00:13:00.319]  I mean, they've done a lot of bad stuff, but they've never grabbed a trillion bucks and publicly handed it over to the private bankers who gave them campaign contributions, while telling the public it was to get the economy going again, and giving no money in the economy.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.020]  I mean, that's a big deal.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:11.703]  By the way, Barack Obama, he is appointing, and he's set up a new commission on the economy,
[00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:15.307]  Of the very insiders that have engineered what we're seeing right now.
[00:13:17.109 --> 00:13:27.478]  Not only have the banks cut off credit and currency and liquidity to the population in Main Street, and to the automakers and everybody else, they are cutting it off and their own documents are public.
[00:13:27.518 --> 00:13:35.566]  We posted them at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to cause an implosion in the economy so they can buy everything up that much cheaper.
[00:13:37.452 --> 00:13:38.212]  But that isn't enough.
[00:13:38.232 --> 00:13:44.795]  They then panic you and say, give us unlimited governmental power and give us trillions of dollars, or there'll be a depression a month ago.
[00:13:45.636 --> 00:13:46.676]  We gotta have it today.
[00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:53.539]  And as of a month plus, not one cent's been given to any of the, quote, banks in trouble.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.421]  It's not been used to, quote, freeze up mortgages.
[00:13:58.182 --> 00:14:01.503]  The truth is, that was all a red herring, as I told you almost three years ago.
[00:14:02.043 --> 00:14:05.585]  Long before any discussion of subprime mortgages was in the news, I said,
[00:14:06.175 --> 00:14:10.978]  They're going to stage the implosion of the economy, starting with the subprime mortgages.
[00:14:13.479 --> 00:14:14.880]  The adjustable rate mortgages.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.281]  It's on record.
[00:14:16.401 --> 00:14:17.341]  It's in articles we wrote.
[00:14:18.022 --> 00:14:18.742]  It's in Endgame.
[00:14:18.762 --> 00:14:21.384]  A film that's been out for a year and a half.
[00:14:23.105 --> 00:14:24.105]  And you saw what happened.
[00:14:24.786 --> 00:14:28.788]  Because we had spies inside an elite meeting in Canada, Bilderberg.
[00:14:28.808 --> 00:14:31.930]  You know, we actually fly on airplanes and get arrested, you know.
[00:14:32.475 --> 00:14:37.960]  Get interrogated and go through hell to bring you information that, of course, turns out to be absolutely accurate.
[00:14:39.621 --> 00:14:40.762]  I mean, this is the real world.
[00:14:41.142 --> 00:14:50.010]  I hope people value what they're hearing here and understand that this isn't a bunch of phony liberal media or a bunch of fake right-wing media that's all bought and paid for by the establishment.
[00:14:50.310 --> 00:15:00.659]  They keep you within that small reservation, within that limited area of debate and discussion, instead of looking at the wider world and information around it.
[00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:06.194]  So when we get back, what I'm going to do is, we're going to talk to Robert and Steve and J.D.
[00:15:06.234 --> 00:15:09.996]  and Jeremy and Mike and John and Juan and many others, folks from D.C.
[00:15:10.016 --> 00:15:12.857]  to New Hampshire, from Texas to Tennessee and Colorado.
[00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:14.678]  We're going to take phone calls.
[00:15:15.818 --> 00:15:20.520]  And then later in the hour, I'm going to go through Barack Obama.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.942]  His new Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, wrote a book, back when he was working for Clinton,
[00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:35.231]  And in his book, he said, we want to disarm the American people, and we want to have national compulsory service for all, and we want to have a national draft again.
[00:15:37.753 --> 00:15:44.819]  And then, uh, Barack Obama has called for a national one million man spy force to spy on you and your family.
[00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:45.919]  We played that clip last week.
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.341]  And he had all this up on Friday.
[00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:49.302]  I covered it on the radio.
[00:15:49.642 --> 00:15:51.964]  He had it all up at change.gov.
[00:15:52.364 --> 00:15:53.465]  That's his presidential
[00:15:55.501 --> 00:15:56.582]  Transition website.
[00:15:56.982 --> 00:15:57.782]  Change.gov.
[00:15:58.943 --> 00:16:00.023]  And they said mandatory.
[00:16:00.143 --> 00:16:04.445]  You're going to mandatory even old people that said they're going to have to work for the government as slaves.
[00:16:05.246 --> 00:16:05.766]  Guess what?
[00:16:06.226 --> 00:16:08.547]  They took it down and some newspapers picked up on it.
[00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:09.928]  They took it down.
[00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:12.509]  So we're going to cover that.
[00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:13.270]  Hey, look.
[00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.751]  This isn't about Barack Obama or George Bush.
[00:16:15.791 --> 00:16:18.092]  Don't you dare say I'm a George Bush supporter.
[00:16:18.472 --> 00:16:22.274]  I'm against what the puppet Barack Obama is pushing.
[00:16:22.294 --> 00:16:22.634]  You got it?
[00:16:22.674 --> 00:16:23.875]  I don't like the policies.
[00:16:24.582 --> 00:16:26.948]  I'm not into all the Hollywood baloney glitz.
[00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.271]  I see through it.
[00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:28.773]  Stay with us.
[00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.550]  I am so frustrated.
[00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:33.791]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:16:33.991 --> 00:16:34.312]  What?
[00:16:34.572 --> 00:16:37.173]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:38.593]  I read something and forget.
[00:16:38.753 --> 00:16:39.914]  I forget people's names.
[00:16:40.014 --> 00:16:43.655]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.436]  I... Okay, slow down.
[00:16:45.556 --> 00:16:47.977]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:16:48.117 --> 00:16:55.159]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:16:55.259 --> 00:16:56.720]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.421]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[00:16:58.621 --> 00:16:59.541]  Even entire books.
[00:16:59.781 --> 00:16:59.981]  What?
[00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:00.382]  How?
[00:17:00.622 --> 00:17:03.825]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:17:03.885 --> 00:17:07.548]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:16.957]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[00:17:17.298 --> 00:17:22.482]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[00:17:22.683 --> 00:17:22.983]  Wow.
[00:17:23.203 --> 00:17:23.964]  What's the website?
[00:17:24.204 --> 00:17:27.507]  Now don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[00:17:27.688 --> 00:17:29.770]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.632]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[00:17:31.992 --> 00:17:33.754]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[00:17:34.194 --> 00:17:35.636]  I can't find my wallet!
[00:17:35.976 --> 00:17:36.677]  Sound familiar?
[00:17:36.817 --> 00:17:40.080]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:40.841]  Introducing...

[00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:31.468]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:18:31.548 --> 00:18:36.330]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:44.292]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:18:44.552 --> 00:18:49.933]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:18:50.133 --> 00:18:57.115]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:18:57.415 --> 00:19:02.739]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.743]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:19:08.084 --> 00:19:15.670]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:22.257]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:19:22.577 --> 00:19:23.779]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:24.039]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:37.629]  What will you do when it happens?
[00:19:37.969 --> 00:19:42.310]  When you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation and fear?
[00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:48.892]  Or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with patriotfood.com?
[00:19:49.312 --> 00:19:50.813]  The signs are everywhere.
[00:19:51.173 --> 00:19:52.793]  You have no excuses.
[00:19:53.194 --> 00:19:57.435]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:03.358]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[00:20:03.598 --> 00:20:09.202]  Patriotfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound.
[00:20:09.442 --> 00:20:12.884]  At Patriotfood.com, you'll get 20 survival foods.
[00:20:13.204 --> 00:20:19.508]  Varieties like dried tomatoes, wild rice blend, beef base, granola, vegetable mix, and much more.
[00:20:19.728 --> 00:20:21.849]  There are just two kinds of people.
[00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.951]  Slave and free.
[00:20:24.471 --> 00:20:26.152]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:20:26.172 --> 00:20:27.474]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:20:55.302 --> 00:20:56.983]  I'm going to get into Barack Obama later.
[00:20:57.003 --> 00:21:10.633]  You know, not what color he is, or how his suits hang on his body, or how they choreographed his victory speech back on Tuesday night and had really fancy Hollywood boom cameras zooming over the crowd that thought that Jesus Christ had landed.
[00:21:12.554 --> 00:21:23.782]  It's that Barack Obama is announcing the exact same agendas of George W. Bush, which was the exact same agendas of Bill Clinton, which was the exact same agendas of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:21:24.963 --> 00:21:30.628]  You have to go back that far before you find a president who actually did a few things different.
[00:21:31.369 --> 00:21:33.891]  Like get us out of the United Nations UNESCO program.
[00:21:34.972 --> 00:21:37.554]  Or engage in detente.
[00:21:38.435 --> 00:21:39.756]  I'm not even saying Reagan was good.
[00:21:39.836 --> 00:21:44.460]  My point is that you can't... I mean, total New World Order since then.
[00:21:45.441 --> 00:21:47.343]  And a lot of New World Order presidents before that.
[00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:50.276]  And it's real simple.
[00:21:50.416 --> 00:21:53.677]  The multinational corporations own both parties.
[00:21:54.157 --> 00:22:00.859]  They put out different PR spin for the public, different flavors of the same junk.
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:10.603]  But see, George Bush, after seven, well almost eight years, seven and three quarter years, couldn't carry the New World Order ball down the field.
[00:22:10.983 --> 00:22:17.385]  National drafts, police state, surveillance, wars, taxation, regulation, control, gun control.
[00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:19.729]  Disarming the slaves.
[00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.131]  Barack Obama can.
[00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:25.092]  And he is.
[00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:30.474]  And the guy, finally, I mean only four or five days, I say finally, but that's quite a while.
[00:22:30.514 --> 00:22:31.355]  People should have seen it earlier.
[00:22:31.775 --> 00:22:35.336]  A lot of even liberal groups are going, wait a minute, now he says we're going to stay in Iraq.
[00:22:35.837 --> 00:22:37.137]  Now he says we're going into Pakistan.
[00:22:37.177 --> 00:22:41.459]  Now he says we're going to keep spying on the American people without warrants.
[00:22:41.499 --> 00:22:41.879]  Well, wait.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.901]  Now he's saying, all down the line,
[00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:48.569]  Being deceptive.
[00:22:48.689 --> 00:22:50.350]  And of course, he was the biggest cheerleader.
[00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:51.731]  More than John McCain.
[00:22:52.411 --> 00:22:53.973]  For the Banker Takeover Bill.
[00:22:54.113 --> 00:22:55.414]  The heist.
[00:22:55.554 --> 00:22:56.875]  The robbery.
[00:22:58.136 --> 00:23:00.477]  Didn't matter if 98% of you didn't want it.
[00:23:01.378 --> 00:23:04.480]  Didn't matter if they were getting a thousand to one phone calls in Congress against it.
[00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:07.062]  Both parties were for it, because they don't work for us.
[00:23:07.523 --> 00:23:09.004]  They work for offshore corporations.
[00:23:09.024 --> 00:23:11.646]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:15.529]  Let's go to Juan in New Hampshire first.
[00:23:16.468 --> 00:23:17.368]  Juan, you're on the air.
[00:23:17.428 --> 00:23:17.748]  Welcome.
[00:23:18.188 --> 00:23:18.788]  Yeah, Alex.
[00:23:18.808 --> 00:23:19.329]  How you doing?
[00:23:19.389 --> 00:23:19.649]  Good.
[00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:23.709]  I wanted to tell you, Oscar, about a problem I'm having.
[00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:35.952]  About six years ago, when I went to enroll my son in the public school system in New Hampshire, they adamantly told me they wouldn't take him because he didn't have the shots.
[00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:36.792]  Yeah, they're liars.
[00:23:36.812 --> 00:23:41.153]  They're criminal liars who lie and say it's the law when it's not because we have a bankrupt criminal government.
[00:23:41.693 --> 00:23:42.173]  Exactly.
[00:23:42.193 --> 00:23:45.314]  The government exists to steal tax money and give it to private banks.
[00:23:45.334 --> 00:23:45.634]  That's it.
[00:23:46.095 --> 00:23:46.515]  That's right.
[00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:51.539]  Now, four years go by, and all of a sudden we get the Troon officer at our house two years ago.
[00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.742]  Now, my wife listens to you and she wouldn't open the door.
[00:23:56.602 --> 00:24:01.326]  So he came back with the Department of Child and Family Services and everything like that.
[00:24:01.726 --> 00:24:04.088]  And let me guess, they didn't have a warrant either.
[00:24:04.408 --> 00:24:04.928]  That's right.
[00:24:04.948 --> 00:24:05.228]  By a judge.
[00:24:05.248 --> 00:24:08.411]  They just make it up because they're dirtbag criminals.
[00:24:08.491 --> 00:24:11.273]  See, they're violating the Fourth Amendment.
[00:24:11.573 --> 00:24:12.974]  They're violating everything.
[00:24:13.746 --> 00:24:14.367]  And they do it.
[00:24:14.627 --> 00:24:16.268]  First they lie and say you gotta take shots.
[00:24:17.249 --> 00:24:20.731]  Then they trigger because your child's not in a government brainwashing camp.
[00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:22.853]  You're obviously homeschooling, which is your right.
[00:24:23.073 --> 00:24:24.795]  California says it's illegal.
[00:24:25.295 --> 00:24:28.237]  Then they come without a warrant and violate the Fourth Amendment.
[00:24:28.397 --> 00:24:31.179]  All part of the vicious dirtbag criminalness.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.963]  But we're supposed to fall down and lick their boots and go, oh, because you've got a uniform, go ahead and destroy America.
[00:24:36.343 --> 00:24:36.944]  I love you.
[00:24:37.264 --> 00:24:38.305]  Okay, so what happened next?
[00:24:38.665 --> 00:24:39.986]  Alright, that was two years ago.
[00:24:41.247 --> 00:24:46.349]  I called him... What did the Department of Child Kidnapping Services do when they showed up at your house?
[00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.969]  Pardon?
[00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.650]  What did the child kidnappers do when they showed up at your house?
[00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.771]  Oh, they were with him, and they were just, like, spying.
[00:24:53.931 --> 00:24:58.272]  And, uh, but... And if your wife wouldn't have been informed, she'd have let him in.
[00:24:58.512 --> 00:25:00.133]  One dog hair, one dirty plate.
[00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:01.613]  Never seen your child again.
[00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:02.514]  That's right.
[00:25:02.654 --> 00:25:04.294]  Be off in some Malaysian rape camp.
[00:25:05.675 --> 00:25:09.356]  Then I called him, and I said, I want to see you, John.
[00:25:09.416 --> 00:25:10.176]  I said, I want to see you.
[00:25:10.848 --> 00:25:13.670]  And he says, okay, he says, how about meeting me at Dunkin' Donuts?
[00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.313]  So I went down to Dunkin' Donuts, and I got in the car with him, and we talked for an hour.
[00:25:18.853 --> 00:25:20.494]  And I told him the whole nine yards.
[00:25:20.554 --> 00:25:23.516]  I said, John, I said, you broke my son's civil rights.
[00:25:23.976 --> 00:25:25.817]  I said, the school system broke our civil rights.
[00:25:26.177 --> 00:25:30.260]  I said, you wouldn't accept him because you said it was the law to be vaccinated.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:31.000]  It's not.
[00:25:31.601 --> 00:25:36.804]  And so we got to, and I was telling him about you, and telling him about, you know... And he said I was probably evil.
[00:25:37.344 --> 00:25:40.406]  Yeah, and so he hands me these papers for homeschooling, right?
[00:25:41.167 --> 00:25:47.690]  So after an hour, you know, I get back to the house after talking to him, I look at him, the policy papers, okay?
[00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.651]  That all came from you, so I spot him.
[00:25:50.211 --> 00:25:52.532]  So I give him a call, I leave him a message.
[00:25:53.033 --> 00:25:54.793]  He doesn't bother us for two years.
[00:25:55.394 --> 00:25:55.954]  He's back.
[00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:59.996]  Last Wednesday, the day after the election, he appears at the house again.
[00:26:01.064 --> 00:26:01.985]  My wife doesn't like them.
[00:26:02.025 --> 00:26:08.129]  No, color of law, illegally, has no reason to be there, but you are a fat hog.
[00:26:08.189 --> 00:26:09.710]  You're a fat slave to them.
[00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.011]  They want some bacon.
[00:26:11.031 --> 00:26:11.591]  They're hungry.
[00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:13.192]  They've got quotas.
[00:26:13.232 --> 00:26:14.393]  They've got children to kidnap.
[00:26:15.053 --> 00:26:18.796]  Now, when I called him, I said, John, you were at the house today.
[00:26:18.816 --> 00:26:20.957]  He was surprised, because we've got people that watch.
[00:26:21.337 --> 00:26:22.578]  And my wife watches, too.
[00:26:23.939 --> 00:26:27.001]  And he said, no, I got a phone call.
[00:26:27.061 --> 00:26:29.643]  He said the DCFS called me.
[00:26:30.447 --> 00:26:33.970]  There's a child there that hasn't been in school.
[00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:49.703]  And that's again, the tattletale neighbors think it's illegal to not be in a vaccination death camp where you learn how to be a prisoner and thumbprint to get school lunches and learn how to be obsessed and feel bad about yourself and learn how to take Ritalin and Prozac and learn how to sort cocaine.
[00:26:50.124 --> 00:26:57.650]  So you don't want to put your child in a death camp and so a scumbag filth neighbor, part of the filth of America, called him.
[00:27:00.302 --> 00:27:00.462]  Hello?
[00:27:00.743 --> 00:27:01.343]  Yes, sir.
[00:27:01.443 --> 00:27:03.085]  So, where are you now with the scum?
[00:27:03.645 --> 00:27:12.073]  Okay, when I called him last Wednesday, I said, John, the papers you gave me were policy papers.
[00:27:12.573 --> 00:27:13.414]  He goes, yeah, I know.
[00:27:14.014 --> 00:27:16.337]  And then I goes, policy is not the law, John.
[00:27:16.477 --> 00:27:17.698]  That's right, scum filth.
[00:27:17.938 --> 00:27:24.424]  No, no, they want to get in your house to find something to hit you and hit you hard because the Saudis need more children.
[00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:26.546]  Okay, so then he says,
[00:27:27.017 --> 00:27:29.659]  He says, well, I said, John, you gave me the policy papers.
[00:27:29.719 --> 00:27:31.500]  I said, that's not, that's not right at all.
[00:27:32.021 --> 00:27:37.825]  I said, I tried to call Corker, which is the... So he's all color of law line because he's a hardcore crook.
[00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:38.565]  What happened?
[00:27:38.585 --> 00:27:39.626]  Now that's criminal!
[00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:41.387]  It's criminal when they do this.
[00:27:41.607 --> 00:27:46.591]  It's criminal when Denver cops attack other cops to put news cameras on it and make protests look bad.
[00:27:46.771 --> 00:27:48.552]  But they've got a job to ban free speech.
[00:27:48.732 --> 00:27:50.734]  They've got a job to demonize demonstration.
[00:27:50.894 --> 00:27:52.835]  They've got a job to take America down.
[00:27:53.115 --> 00:27:54.276]  They've got a job!
[00:27:54.316 --> 00:27:55.397]  And they're doing it good.
[00:27:55.837 --> 00:27:56.618]  So what else happened?
[00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.264]  So, um, he was going to call me back the next day.
[00:28:00.787 --> 00:28:01.369]  He never did.
[00:28:02.153 --> 00:28:03.894]  So then I called him Friday twice.
[00:28:04.254 --> 00:28:05.195]  He never returned the phone.
[00:28:05.215 --> 00:28:06.295]  You better watch yourself.
[00:28:06.696 --> 00:28:08.577]  And if I was you, I would go ahead and move.
[00:28:08.597 --> 00:28:12.199]  And then I would register your house in some corporation's name.
[00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:13.560]  I'd set up your own little corporation.
[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.680]  That's totally legal.
[00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:28.348]  And because black, you know, the little black ops operation is mad that your child's not in a fluoride facility where they give them the fluoride water and give them the fluoride pills to eat to brain damage them and the injections and to be just like the rest of the zombie scum.
[00:28:28.808 --> 00:28:29.028]  Right.
[00:28:31.517 --> 00:28:36.440]  So, and he said to me, he said, DCFS is going to take you to court, is what he said.
[00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:38.601]  The Department of Child and Family Services.
[00:28:38.641 --> 00:28:39.702]  Now the scum is coming.
[00:28:39.742 --> 00:28:41.143]  They're saying, parents, you don't.
[00:28:41.843 --> 00:28:46.006]  The California State Court said, parents, you don't, you aren't the parents.
[00:28:46.046 --> 00:28:48.147]  It says the state owns your children.
[00:28:48.447 --> 00:28:48.587]  Right.
[00:28:48.647 --> 00:28:50.448]  And we're going to carry eugenics out against you.
[00:28:51.449 --> 00:28:55.751]  CPS was set up a hundred years ago by the British to carry out eugenics operations.
[00:28:57.372 --> 00:28:58.833]  And listen, it's all terrorism.
[00:28:59.901 --> 00:29:01.342]  You would have already had your child kidnapped.
[00:29:01.362 --> 00:29:02.402]  You just never let them in.
[00:29:02.922 --> 00:29:03.743]  Just don't ever let them.
[00:29:03.963 --> 00:29:05.103]  Just stay calm with them.
[00:29:05.483 --> 00:29:07.264]  Remember that they're pieces of filth.
[00:29:08.024 --> 00:29:10.405]  And just call me on the air if you have any other problems, okay?
[00:29:10.885 --> 00:29:11.826]  Alright, I appreciate it Alex.
[00:29:11.846 --> 00:29:13.526]  And you don't worry about those hardcore criminals.
[00:29:13.546 --> 00:29:14.647]  Okay?
[00:29:14.767 --> 00:29:15.267]  They're scum.
[00:29:15.287 --> 00:29:16.067]  They're filth.
[00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:19.449]  And we're gonna rise up against them and defeat them!
[00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.930]  Stay with me.
[00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:27.672]  There's too much confusion in me.
[00:29:31.664 --> 00:29:34.325]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[00:29:34.805 --> 00:29:37.125]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[00:29:37.726 --> 00:29:41.567]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[00:29:42.007 --> 00:29:46.968]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.

[00:33:13.621 --> 00:33:14.562]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:33:43.931 --> 00:33:48.134]  Yeah, I want to explain something to everybody out there listening why I got so angry during the last segment.
[00:33:49.175 --> 00:33:52.558]  I'm going to tell you one story of thousands that are declassified.
[00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:54.459]  One story.
[00:33:56.201 --> 00:34:06.929]  The Department of Child Services, they have different names in different states, kidnapped over 4,000 children in the 1940s and 1950s.
[00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:12.394]  This is all on the Atomic Energy Agency websites, Department of Energy websites here in the U.S.
[00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:18.953]  But internationally, they reported as well, they took the small children and radiated them to death in radiation chambers.
[00:34:20.854 --> 00:34:22.235]  That's your government, okay?
[00:34:22.335 --> 00:34:23.856]  And I'm sorry if you don't want to hear it.
[00:34:24.096 --> 00:34:29.859]  I can give you over a thousand stories of them taking our troops into chambers and nerve-gassing them to death in the 90s.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:32.841]  That was to test and see if the U.S.
[00:34:32.921 --> 00:34:34.962]  Army will murder our own troops.
[00:34:35.862 --> 00:34:36.823]  One time I had one of
[00:34:38.524 --> 00:34:40.627]  One of Governor Perry's top people.
[00:34:40.647 --> 00:34:42.089]  You see the guy on TV with him all the time.
[00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:43.210]  In fact, the guy who gave me his card.
[00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.911]  I need to get him on.
[00:34:44.552 --> 00:34:46.815]  And he admitted, he said, oh yeah, the Governor's not all bad.
[00:34:47.096 --> 00:34:49.419]  But I know you're telling the truth here in your film, Endgame.
[00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:50.380]  He'd just seen Endgame.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:55.847]  He goes, you know, I was at Fort Sam Houston as a medic and they brought in the Special Forces guy from Bragg.
[00:34:56.633 --> 00:35:00.877]  They'd been in the medical facility, gave them shots, and they all died in three days.
[00:35:01.277 --> 00:35:02.558]  And it was a bioweapons test.
[00:35:02.858 --> 00:35:03.399]  They were murdered.
[00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:04.940]  He wasn't part of it.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.542]  He just said they were taken there and killed right in front of him.
[00:35:07.902 --> 00:35:12.626]  And they had to go in decontamination suits and clean out the barracks.
[00:35:14.188 --> 00:35:15.409]  That's just how it works.
[00:35:16.089 --> 00:35:20.853]  We have people running things that openly will murder you at the drop of a hat.
[00:35:23.175 --> 00:35:25.739]  And you see, that kind of makes me not sleep at night.
[00:35:25.759 --> 00:35:28.662]  That makes me as a... who's somewhat of an aggressive guy.
[00:35:28.682 --> 00:35:30.385]  I haven't been gelded.
[00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:31.907]  I haven't been neutered.
[00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.672]  I get threatened by that and I get angry.
[00:35:35.712 --> 00:35:35.832]  So...
[00:35:36.852 --> 00:35:52.996]  A father calls in to tell the story I've heard a million times and says, yeah, they wouldn't take my son to the public school because I wouldn't take the shots, and they told me I was a liar, there was no federal or state law, there's both, for a waiver form, but it's a waiver to a law that doesn't even exist, and that by law they're supposed to give you the waiver.
[00:35:53.016 --> 00:36:01.018]  That's really the only law, that the school, through its policy, is demanding it, without law, that they have to give you the waiver.
[00:36:02.599 --> 00:36:03.379]  And they lie everywhere.
[00:36:04.358 --> 00:36:07.603]  You'll watch school start again next year and they'll say it's the law, you'll be arrested.
[00:36:07.904 --> 00:36:08.565]  Total lie!
[00:36:09.246 --> 00:36:19.621]  You can type Texas Vaccine Waiver, New York Vaccine Waiver, you'll be on the state website, you'll find out, and it'll say there is no law, but if the school's giving you trouble, you know, print this off and give it to them.
[00:36:23.863 --> 00:36:28.704]  But I have been there, in the court cases in Austin, where they steal people's children for not giving them shots.
[00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:30.064]  And they don't care!
[00:36:30.124 --> 00:36:31.005]  There's no law!
[00:36:31.485 --> 00:36:39.106]  In these family courts, they set up through eugenics in England about 110 years ago, the US about 95 years ago.
[00:36:39.546 --> 00:36:51.829]  In my film, we have little newsreels and little clips of the family courts that were set up for eugenics in the early 30s.
[00:36:53.123 --> 00:36:54.484]  Where they're sterilizing women.
[00:36:55.105 --> 00:37:01.890]  See, there's no jury, there's no habeas corpus, there's no, um, you murdered somebody so you're going to prison.
[00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:06.694]  It's just, we're a kangaroo court, we have men that have guns that enforce for us, and that's the end of it.
[00:37:08.716 --> 00:37:13.579]  So I hear about these creatures circling a family, like sharks circling a family.
[00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:17.963]  Like huge sharks around a tiny lifeboat.
[00:37:19.212 --> 00:37:23.734]  I think about how wicked this government is, how criminal it is, the things it's committing to us right now.
[00:37:44.723 --> 00:37:50.327]  And just how evil they are, how they show up with the police and the CPS with no warrant, no bill of particulars, nothing.
[00:37:50.587 --> 00:37:52.809]  They're just there to threaten and force their way in.
[00:37:55.511 --> 00:37:56.612]  And hey, you know what, cops?
[00:37:56.632 --> 00:38:01.216]  You commit that crime and go with that extrajudicial
[00:38:02.185 --> 00:38:09.150]  If you're a fascist and you go to a house and you commit those crimes, you bet you're a jackboot thug, and I hope God curses you straight to Hades itself.
[00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.550]  I do.
[00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.411]  You keep your hands off the kids.
[00:38:11.852 --> 00:38:14.293]  Now, if you're a good cop and don't go along with that, you're going to be fired!
[00:38:15.734 --> 00:38:18.796]  But I mean, I'm not going to sit here and kiss your hind end anymore.
[00:38:19.056 --> 00:38:19.517]  It's over.
[00:38:19.837 --> 00:38:29.944]  Now, I said I wasn't going to take a lot of calls today, but I have the police in Denver, as we reported to you two months ago, I don't need the Denver Post to tell me this, probe into police stage DC
[00:38:31.132 --> 00:38:31.633]  D.N.C.
[00:38:31.673 --> 00:38:32.253]  protest.
[00:38:34.035 --> 00:38:34.736]  Got another one here.
[00:38:34.796 --> 00:38:37.879]  ACLU wants to probe into police staged D.N.C.
[00:38:37.919 --> 00:38:38.420]  protest.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:46.248]  And it says right here, cops went in and attacked other cops for the news cameras that first day in Denver.
[00:38:46.288 --> 00:38:48.090]  And I reported that sucker was staged.
[00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.353]  I mean, number one, little bitty scrawny
[00:38:52.148 --> 00:38:55.451]  Anarchists aren't huge six-foot-two guys with giant arms.
[00:38:55.851 --> 00:38:57.392]  I mean, I've been at these events over and over again.
[00:38:57.432 --> 00:38:58.694]  Here come the cops dressed up.
[00:38:59.054 --> 00:39:00.395]  They want to ban the protest.
[00:39:00.435 --> 00:39:01.956]  They want to attack the First Amendment.
[00:39:02.317 --> 00:39:03.277]  They stage events.
[00:39:03.818 --> 00:39:05.279]  I mean, number one, I'm not an idiot.
[00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:09.322]  And we've caught you over and over again.
[00:39:09.342 --> 00:39:12.745]  I know if we're getting awesome, 19... was it 80... 98 or 99.
[00:39:12.805 --> 00:39:15.027]  They had the Fortune 500 meeting in 98 or 99.
[00:39:15.127 --> 00:39:16.969]  I think it was 99.
[00:39:21.636 --> 00:39:24.697]  In downtown Austin, there were these giant anarchists, huge cops.
[00:39:24.717 --> 00:39:28.499]  One of them was like 6'6", probably weighed 300 pounds.
[00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:30.539]  They were starting fights, pushing people.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.880]  And I said, these are cops, media.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:33.501]  These are cops.
[00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:34.361]  This is not us.
[00:39:35.962 --> 00:39:39.303]  And then all these cops ran across the street and they said, back off, Jones.
[00:39:39.703 --> 00:39:44.385]  And they pulled those two guys out and stuck two more cops in to start fights and stuff.
[00:39:44.885 --> 00:39:47.346]  But since we had video cameras on them, they had to back off.
[00:39:50.464 --> 00:39:56.687]  Now, again, why would the Austin police want to stop people protesting and set a precedent to ban it?
[00:39:58.468 --> 00:40:01.149]  Why would they want to go all over the city and lose scores of lawsuits?
[00:40:01.169 --> 00:40:04.090]  The city of Austin is up to, like, what, $10 million?
[00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:11.013]  Last time I checked, in lawsuits they've lost, for coming up to people protesting peacefully on the street corner and arresting them, saying, you've got to have a permit for that?
[00:40:11.334 --> 00:40:11.914]  No, you don't.
[00:40:12.414 --> 00:40:14.175]  And so taxpayers of Austin had to pay that.
[00:40:16.465 --> 00:40:20.008]  Why does the City of Austin Police hate the First Amendment?
[00:40:20.408 --> 00:40:21.669]  Why do you want to stop it?
[00:40:21.929 --> 00:40:24.110]  Why do your higher-ups order you to do this?
[00:40:24.751 --> 00:40:26.092]  Why do you carry this out?
[00:40:26.532 --> 00:40:31.415]  Why do you go out and pose as demonstrators to attack other cops?
[00:40:32.056 --> 00:40:33.037]  Most of the time, it's rigged.
[00:40:33.077 --> 00:40:37.760]  In Seattle, they had cops break bottles over cops' heads, and I interviewed the cops.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.982]  They're in my film, Policing to the Takeover, and they're like, yeah, I found a letter.
[00:40:41.002 --> 00:40:45.225]  Those were cops, and I was ordered to stand there and let them throw bottles at me.
[00:40:47.788 --> 00:40:49.029]  Nobody's throwing a bottle at me.
[00:40:49.129 --> 00:40:51.370]  I mean, I want to get that out in the open here.
[00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.691]  You know, police, you should thank your lucky stars for people like Alex Jones.
[00:40:56.972 --> 00:41:01.894]  Because I'm here on air, decrying police being asked to engage in crime.
[00:41:04.275 --> 00:41:05.555]  To engage in corrupt things.
[00:41:06.956 --> 00:41:10.698]  So, the message is, things are far more corrupt than you know.
[00:41:12.698 --> 00:41:13.799]  They're far worse than you know.
[00:41:15.393 --> 00:41:41.074]  and uh... the public are a bunch of idiots and don't know what's happening on average and i don't know what are you know what i said i take all the whole show and i haven't hardly done that uh... let's talk to uh... let's talk to robert in colorado you're on the air robert well hello alexander mcjones thanks for taking my call i do appreciate that um... couple things uh... thank you for several things number one thanks for what you do appreciate you uh...
[00:41:41.772 --> 00:41:44.753]  Standing in the gap, as a good book says, and finding a good fight.
[00:41:46.174 --> 00:41:48.174]  Thank you for installing that call-in number.
[00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:48.974]  You can listen to 512-646-5000.
[00:41:49.475 --> 00:41:52.196]  That's pretty cool and pretty handy.
[00:41:52.216 --> 00:41:56.137]  You can call from any phone and listen to your show if you can't get it to your computer.
[00:41:56.937 --> 00:42:00.238]  Ignore the attacks calling you a bigot because you're the farthest thing but.
[00:42:00.258 --> 00:42:04.540]  You're just a man who cares about society and humanity and tries to do the right thing.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.201]  So people who call you a bigot are just small-minded.
[00:42:07.441 --> 00:42:08.621]  Well, I mean, that's the new thing.
[00:42:08.641 --> 00:42:10.502]  You're called a communist if you're against Bush.
[00:42:11.118 --> 00:42:17.342]  And then if you criticize Obama, according to the media, he can do no wrong, and so it's only because he's black.
[00:42:17.803 --> 00:42:22.426]  It's not that you don't want to have your kids in a draft, or compulsory service yourself, or be a slave.
[00:42:23.066 --> 00:42:29.170]  If you're against being a slave to the federal government, and that's what he's openly stated, it's coming up in the next hour, you are now against the Messiah.
[00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:33.833]  Yeah, Obama's a bad guy, and we haven't seen the worst of him yet.
[00:42:34.034 --> 00:42:37.796]  But what happened in Alaska with Begich vs. Stevens?
[00:42:37.856 --> 00:42:40.038]  How did that Senate race play out?
[00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:40.338]  Do you know?
[00:42:41.779 --> 00:42:43.160]  I know Stephen's the criminal.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.462]  I heard him defended here locally.
[00:42:44.482 --> 00:42:48.285]  He got convicted on all seven counts and I believe Begich won, didn't he?
[00:42:49.045 --> 00:42:49.306]  Did he?
[00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:50.567]  Okay, I wasn't sure.
[00:42:50.627 --> 00:42:52.368]  I knew it was somewhat close.
[00:42:52.388 --> 00:42:56.992]  Just go to Google and type in Alaska Senate race and we'll find out the numbers.
[00:42:57.573 --> 00:42:58.473]  I appreciate your call.
[00:42:58.493 --> 00:43:02.056]  You know, we're going to come back and I'm going to get to your calls.
[00:43:03.057 --> 00:43:09.803]  I just start talking about all the crimes I know that illegitimate criminal government commits every day.
[00:43:11.374 --> 00:43:12.675]  It's now institutionalized.
[00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:15.378]  I mean, they just commit crime right out in the open.
[00:43:15.898 --> 00:43:21.624]  And just, yeah, yeah, we're dealing with drugs, yeah, we're posing as anarchists and starting fights so we can ban protests.
[00:43:22.084 --> 00:43:25.007]  Yeah, we're taking people's kids with no warrants or no probable cause.
[00:43:25.748 --> 00:43:28.711]  And yeah, a lot of them died in our custody, but so what?
[00:43:30.262 --> 00:43:31.984]  Lead from solder and copper pipes.
[00:43:32.144 --> 00:43:33.225]  Mercury from fish.
[00:43:33.305 --> 00:43:34.066]  Dental fillings.
[00:43:34.226 --> 00:43:34.807]  Vaccines.
[00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:35.868]  Arsenic in the water.
[00:43:35.988 --> 00:43:39.852]  These heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[00:43:40.012 --> 00:43:43.756]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[00:43:43.976 --> 00:43:52.705]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure, including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders, neuropathy,
[00:43:52.885 --> 00:43:53.286]  I don't know.
[00:44:10.123 --> 00:44:22.512]  Among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing, Pura Clear also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.

[00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:53.562]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone, do?
[00:46:53.862 --> 00:46:58.344]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[00:46:58.624 --> 00:47:00.504]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[00:47:00.724 --> 00:47:03.985]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[00:47:04.285 --> 00:47:10.906]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.

[00:47:25.489 --> 00:47:33.075]  Yeah, Barack Obama wants to bring into place what Bill Clinton and George Bush both have called for.
[00:47:33.115 --> 00:47:34.556]  National Compulsory Service.
[00:47:34.576 --> 00:47:35.356]  They've got bills.
[00:47:55.766 --> 00:47:57.768]  Introduced for that to make you join the military.
[00:47:57.788 --> 00:48:02.511]  The new Chief of Staff wants to make you join the military for one year.
[00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:07.074]  And of course be a slave, the Slave Master Obama.
[00:48:07.434 --> 00:48:09.016]  But because I don't want to be his slave!
[00:48:09.056 --> 00:48:11.517]  I mean, you can't have a black guy who's for slavery.
[00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:14.219]  Funny, it was blacks selling blacks on the slave ships.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.421]  We've had slavery worldwide over and over again by every group.
[00:48:17.962 --> 00:48:20.844]  Slaving, I mean, Rome enslaved mainly white people.
[00:48:21.534 --> 00:48:22.555]  See, folks don't know that.
[00:48:22.575 --> 00:48:26.259]  They think, well, you know, if Obama says the government's going to own me, that's great.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.922]  You got all these people saying, well, I don't have to worry about my bills anymore.
[00:48:29.942 --> 00:48:30.663]  Have you heard these clips?
[00:48:30.683 --> 00:48:32.825]  I don't have to worry about my taxes anymore.
[00:48:32.885 --> 00:48:35.408]  My whole future's solved with Obama.
[00:48:36.088 --> 00:48:39.792]  Meanwhile, with the bailout, he's just giving all the money to foreign banks and laughing at you.
[00:48:40.618 --> 00:48:46.060]  And he's keeping all the bankers on from the Bush takeover plan with his policy.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.100]  But just get ready.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.481]  Find out for yourself.
[00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:52.362]  And then when you finally wake up that Obama's bad, they'll give you a Republican.
[00:48:52.382 --> 00:48:55.703]  And then you'll get fooled by that again and take a few years to figure that out.
[00:48:56.263 --> 00:48:57.804]  It's the New World Order.
[00:48:57.864 --> 00:48:59.925]  They own both the parties.
[00:48:59.985 --> 00:49:05.066]  And until we turn that around, all these smiley corporate faces are going to keep fooling us.
[00:49:07.079 --> 00:49:08.180]  Look at that insincere.
[00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:08.980]  I'm holding up time.
[00:49:09.401 --> 00:49:11.202]  This is Newsweek with Barack Obama.
[00:49:12.162 --> 00:49:13.383]  President 44 on there.
[00:49:13.724 --> 00:49:15.605]  Just totally insincere.
[00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:16.786]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:49:16.806 --> 00:49:17.506]  You've got to find out.
[00:49:17.766 --> 00:49:20.808]  And as long as you feel good about yourself while you're being screwed, so what?
[00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.171]  Land of the delusional Prozac heads.
[00:49:26.232 --> 00:49:27.513]  No longer land of the free and the brave.
[00:49:27.533 --> 00:49:28.694]  It's just land of the delusional.
[00:49:28.754 --> 00:49:29.814]  Land of the lied to.
[00:49:30.435 --> 00:49:31.656]  Land of the PR addicted.
[00:49:33.297 --> 00:49:35.518]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in D.C.
[00:49:35.538 --> 00:49:36.359]  You're on the air, Steve.
[00:49:36.969 --> 00:49:37.269]  Go ahead.
[00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:44.113]  Hey Alex, um, I'm black myself and to be quite honest, Obama is a piece of trash.
[00:49:44.333 --> 00:49:50.956]  I mean, I have a friend from Nigeria and he doesn't support Obama because he's seen this back there.
[00:49:51.796 --> 00:49:58.800]  And it's nothing new, but I did want to ask you, have you seen, um, Obama's Jesus statue in Chicago?
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:04.342]  And supposedly his hands are in the same position as, uh, bafflement is.
[00:50:04.943 --> 00:50:05.423]  It's, uh,
[00:50:06.152 --> 00:50:07.232]  As above, so below.
[00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:15.315]  And also, if you'll notice... That's the same one that the famous George Washington statue, where one hand's above, one hand's below.
[00:50:16.415 --> 00:50:16.976]  Yeah.
[00:50:17.036 --> 00:50:28.339]  No, I haven't seen the Obama statue saying he's Jesus, but I've seen all these headlines and articles in the mainstream corporate press that told us that Iraq had aluminum tubes and uranium and WMDs and carried out 9-11.
[00:50:29.039 --> 00:50:33.981]  And the same corporate press that told us George Bush was a great guy is now calling him the one.
[00:50:34.608 --> 00:50:54.519]  And I feel so sorry for all these folks, not just black folks, but I mean white folks think, everybody thinks, I mean, you know, 34% of the population thinks that literally God has arrived, and I got news for you folks, he's just got a different paint job than George Bush, and people better get ready, because it's the same thing under the hood.
[00:50:55.259 --> 00:50:57.320]  And people better get ready for the new world order.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.382]  I mean, Barack Obama, out of the gates,
[00:51:01.542 --> 00:51:08.789]  Yeah, my last statement is, if Obama has his truth squad, why isn't he denouncing all the calls for him to be this Messiah or Jesus?
[00:51:24.615 --> 00:51:32.041]  Supposedly, they're supposed to catch these things that aren't true, but he's not addressing these issues, so I guess he is accepting his godhood.
[00:51:32.922 --> 00:51:37.545]  Well, I mean, if you go to his websites, they talk about him being the one, the answer.
[00:51:37.565 --> 00:51:41.728]  He ran TV ads where they're... I mean, get ready, folks.
[00:51:41.808 --> 00:51:45.731]  I've never seen the media so behind somebody.
[00:51:46.792 --> 00:51:48.553]  And again, they're not liberal, they're not conservative.
[00:51:48.613 --> 00:51:50.094]  All the liberal media, what do you expect?
[00:51:50.154 --> 00:51:51.075]  It's not liberal.
[00:51:51.515 --> 00:51:53.177]  They're owned by the military-industrial complex.
[00:51:55.092 --> 00:51:55.933]  I am so sad.
[00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:56.673]  I wish.
[00:51:56.693 --> 00:52:01.596]  Because, I mean, on the surface, frankly, I'm tired of racism and classism and infighting.
[00:52:01.917 --> 00:52:04.538]  Man, I would love it if we had a black president who was anti-New World Order.
[00:52:04.558 --> 00:52:05.999]  I'd love it if the guy had green skin.
[00:52:06.019 --> 00:52:06.479]  I don't care.
[00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:24.271]  But now, I think it's going to increase all the race fighting and all this, because now it's going to all be about, oh, you just don't like him because he's black, or, well, no, look, he is bad because he's black, and then it's just going to... I mean, every angle I look at this, instead of it being about the issues,
[00:52:25.043 --> 00:52:27.184]  Or about who's funding him, or who's behind him.
[00:52:27.604 --> 00:52:29.605]  It's all gonna be about what color he is.
[00:52:30.185 --> 00:52:33.126]  And that's why the new order loves it so much, because it's the perfect distraction.
[00:52:33.426 --> 00:52:34.487]  Perfect distraction, Steve.
[00:52:34.727 --> 00:52:36.427]  I mean, what are other folks saying in D.C.?
[00:52:37.508 --> 00:52:40.829]  Oh, well, basically my co-workers asked me, um, was I voting?
[00:52:40.889 --> 00:52:41.649]  I told them no.
[00:52:41.769 --> 00:52:46.251]  I really wanted to vote, but I just was just so down about the whole issue.
[00:52:46.731 --> 00:52:51.973]  When I told them I wasn't voting, they looked like I committed a blasphemy myself.
[00:52:52.543 --> 00:52:58.127]  And I told them I wasn't supporting Barack Obama because he was the same as, he is the same as Bush.
[00:52:58.628 --> 00:53:04.052]  Lock and step, voted for Patriot Act, funding of the war in Iraq, different issues.
[00:53:04.633 --> 00:53:08.015]  And basically, I've gotten the silent treatment at work.
[00:53:08.536 --> 00:53:12.459]  So I've learned it's best not to blaspheme against Obama, I suppose.
[00:53:13.328 --> 00:53:13.948]  Well, that's it.
[00:53:14.128 --> 00:53:17.729]  Maybe you should just slowly educate them and explain, hey, I'm not for George Bush.
[00:53:18.089 --> 00:53:20.110]  Do you know what corporate PR is?
[00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:23.771]  Like a car commercial or a soft drink ad.
[00:53:24.431 --> 00:53:27.512]  This is corporate PR, like Diamonds Forever, De Beers.
[00:53:28.893 --> 00:53:31.414]  Again, the American people aren't aware they're being showered.
[00:53:32.654 --> 00:53:35.915]  They're being bombarded with propaganda.
[00:53:36.747 --> 00:53:41.488]  And then they're convinced propaganda doesn't exist instead of looking at what somebody actually does.
[00:53:41.548 --> 00:53:46.649]  But bottom line, again, they love Obama because he makes it look like we're going to have change.
[00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.410]  Meanwhile, the whole New World Order agenda continues.
[00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:50.630]  And I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:53:51.771 --> 00:53:53.771]  And you know what?
[00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:54.851]  Oh, man.
[00:53:55.252 --> 00:53:57.092]  I mean, any way you cut this, we're in trouble.
[00:53:58.832 --> 00:54:00.373]  People say, well, why didn't you vote for McCain?
[00:54:00.433 --> 00:54:04.914]  Because I can't endorse eight years of George Bush and lying and warmongering.
[00:54:06.906 --> 00:54:08.826]  I can't go along with all of this.
[00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.067]  I didn't vote for Obama either.
[00:54:12.847 --> 00:54:14.307]  I'm not going to be part of this anymore.
[00:54:14.327 --> 00:54:28.810]  Do you understand, folks, that the police are still going to stage riots, the government's still going to ship heroin and cocaine in, they're still going to arrest people and secretly torture them to death and torture them for confessions, they're still going to hand trillions of dollars to the foreign private banks.
[00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:32.911]  It's just now, instead of people not trusting George Bush, knowing he's a lying scumbag,
[00:54:33.527 --> 00:54:37.008]  After eight years to figure it out, the New World Order has put on a new set of tires.
[00:54:37.709 --> 00:54:39.429]  They've put on a new birdcage liner.
[00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:41.350]  They have put on another distraction.
[00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:42.070]  It's so simple.
[00:54:42.971 --> 00:54:44.251]  And our caller from D.C.
[00:54:44.291 --> 00:54:45.192]  gets it, other people don't.
[00:54:45.572 --> 00:54:45.932]  J.D.
[00:54:45.972 --> 00:54:47.593]  in Mississippi, you're on the air, J.D.
[00:54:48.433 --> 00:54:50.574]  The truth is stranger than fiction, my friend.
[00:54:50.994 --> 00:54:51.634]  It is.
[00:54:52.215 --> 00:54:54.335]  I just wanted to run past you a few things.
[00:54:55.116 --> 00:55:00.798]  First, on November 22nd, there's going to be a In the Fed national protest.
[00:55:01.785 --> 00:55:06.789]  Um, it's going to be all over the Federal Reserve, um, places around the United States.
[00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:10.431]  That's right, it's got 12 regional banks, and Gary Franchi's setting that up.
[00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:16.295]  People should go out and protest the private Federal Reserve that is the, that's the real government.
[00:55:16.615 --> 00:55:17.916]  Not Barack Obama, folks.
[00:55:18.297 --> 00:55:21.639]  Under the Banker Takeover Bill, they were given governmental power.
[00:55:22.479 --> 00:55:24.501]  Exactly, and uh, but we're, I'm,
[00:55:24.966 --> 00:55:27.787]  Me being here in North Mississippi, we're going to be up in Memphis.
[00:55:28.367 --> 00:55:32.089]  I just got me a Gadsden flag to take up there.
[00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:33.530]  This is Don't Tread on Me.
[00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.951]  It's got the coiled snake on it.
[00:55:35.971 --> 00:55:37.191]  We're going to be up there filming it.
[00:55:37.211 --> 00:55:38.152]  Try to bullhorn them.
[00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.557]  There's going to be a Nashville Olive.
[00:55:41.937 --> 00:55:43.497]  I'd like to see it international.
[00:55:44.197 --> 00:55:51.560]  Well, it is going to be international because they have the same private families than on the Federal Reserve, on the Bank of England, and the Bundesbank in Germany, and others.
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.100]  It is the same.
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:56.021]  By the way, they're the ones openly announcing world government run by the bankers.
[00:55:56.081 --> 00:56:00.422]  They engineer the crisis and say, the answer is setting up a world government we run.
[00:56:01.122 --> 00:56:03.223]  We're going to give you a carbon tax on everything you do.
[00:56:03.683 --> 00:56:06.404]  They have all these idiot school kids go out and, yeah, ban carbon.
[00:56:06.966 --> 00:56:08.627]  There's nothing to do with hurting the environment.
[00:56:08.647 --> 00:56:09.808]  It's what plants breathe.
[00:56:10.248 --> 00:56:13.149]  By the way, the Earth is getting cooler now because the sun just cooled off.
[00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.251]  It's normal to have climate change.
[00:56:15.291 --> 00:56:17.752]  Now they're not saying, we've got to stop global warming.
[00:56:17.792 --> 00:56:19.053]  Now it's climate change.
[00:56:19.633 --> 00:56:22.094]  Pretty soon, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:56:22.114 --> 00:56:23.175]  There are no seasons.
[00:56:24.136 --> 00:56:28.518]  The old timers claim that once the Earth's temperature has changed, but not anymore.
[00:56:29.078 --> 00:56:30.299]  That's a lie of Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:32.940]  Al-Qaeda tells you there are seasons.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.662]  Al-Qaeda tells you some decades are cold, some are hot.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.042]  Some winners, cold, some not, some moderate.
[00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:40.643]  That's a lie of Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:41.043 --> 00:56:46.106]  If you question that, the great lawgiver, Lord Obama, sends you to the love camp.
[00:56:47.407 --> 00:56:48.948]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:56:49.808 --> 00:56:51.990]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremy in Tennessee.
[00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:53.611]  Jeremy, you're on the air.
[00:56:53.671 --> 00:56:53.991]  Welcome.
[00:56:54.691 --> 00:56:55.452]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:56:56.232 --> 00:56:57.593]  Got a bit of a cold, but I'm good.
[00:56:57.613 --> 00:56:57.853]  Go ahead.
[00:56:57.873 --> 00:56:59.734]  That's why I sound a bit different.
[00:56:59.754 --> 00:57:00.455]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:00.535 --> 00:57:02.056]  As you know, I'm a soldier.
[00:57:02.096 --> 00:57:04.337]  I've been calling in on your show for about two years.
[00:57:06.169 --> 00:57:18.875]  I think honestly, even though Obama won and I don't agree with him at all, but the best thing I think could have happened to our movement is that because there are so many conservatives that used to snicker at me and laugh at me at work.
[00:57:19.555 --> 00:57:20.416]  You know, I'm around a lot.
[00:57:20.636 --> 00:57:24.137]  I'm in a special operations unit and I don't support Bush.
[00:57:24.197 --> 00:57:25.138]  I don't support McCain.
[00:57:25.198 --> 00:57:28.919]  And now suddenly they're worried about FEMA and they're worried about youth brigades.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:34.182]  I had a female captain come up to me on Friday at the gym, come up going,
[00:57:34.963 --> 00:57:36.564]  You know, we're all going to die now.
[00:57:36.824 --> 00:57:38.425]  And I'm like, yeah, welcome to my nightmare.
[00:57:38.445 --> 00:57:40.407]  I've been telling you about Obama for a year.
[00:57:41.047 --> 00:57:41.348]  You know?
[00:57:42.028 --> 00:57:46.271]  So, I had a story, it's kind of positive, about something I learned from you.
[00:57:46.971 --> 00:57:52.315]  I'm an NCO in the Army, and there's a lot of good people... Listen, can you stay there through the news?
[00:57:52.756 --> 00:57:53.356]  Yes, sir, I can.
[00:57:53.376 --> 00:57:54.477]  I promise we'll go to you.
[00:57:55.958 --> 00:57:57.179]  I mean, it's so childish.
[00:57:57.219 --> 00:57:59.300]  Frankly, I don't even feel like being here most days.
[00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:04.664]  Because why do I have to explain to the audience, not my listeners, but other people, you know, on AMNF and listening,
[00:58:05.279 --> 00:58:07.462]  That it isn't about George Bush or Obama.
[00:58:07.502 --> 00:58:10.245]  These guys don't run anything.
[00:58:10.986 --> 00:58:12.148]  They're cutouts, folks.
[00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:12.969]  They're fronts.
[00:58:13.609 --> 00:58:16.113]  We're talking about what's going on in the back room.
[00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:17.254]  The big boys.
[00:58:17.334 --> 00:58:17.915]  The bankers.
[00:58:18.395 --> 00:58:18.956]  Stay with me.
[00:58:18.996 --> 00:58:20.438]  We can save the republic together.
[00:58:20.678 --> 00:58:24.901]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.
[00:58:25.041 --> 00:58:27.863]  Now you can do even more to hear Genesis shows in your area.

[00:58:57.722 --> 00:59:05.285]  This low-mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:59:05.345 --> 00:59:08.967]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.

[00:59:23.206 --> 00:59:29.173]  Long time survivalist author Ragnar Benson wrote, A survival retreat is a place you go to live, not die.
[00:59:29.573 --> 00:59:34.558]  It is a place out of the mainstream of events that contains the means to survive without outside support.
[00:59:35.059 --> 00:59:41.446]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine, and warmth you prepared for yourself.
[00:59:41.966 --> 00:59:46.871]  It is defensible and is put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers will be.
[00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:49.834]  Ragnar Benson also said, Why retreat?
[00:59:50.434 --> 00:59:54.558]  This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer.
[00:59:54.959 --> 01:00:00.284]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they are now.
[01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:03.046]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat.
[01:00:03.627 --> 01:00:06.570]  Something completely impossible for the average American to do.
[01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.711]  Act now before it's too late.

[01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:53.539]  John Podesta tells Fox News Sunday a review is underway of executive orders on stem cell research, oil and gas drilling, and other matters.
[01:00:54.139 --> 01:00:58.641]  He also says the current administration must work on new legislation to aid the economy.
[01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:06.865]  The job is up to President Bush to move that legislation forward and try to keep economic recovery moving.
[01:01:07.085 --> 01:01:13.048]  Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, says the ailing auto industry will need to be revived to keep the economy going.
[01:01:13.108 --> 01:01:15.309]  President-elect Obama has asked his economic team
[01:01:15.982 --> 01:01:27.946]  To look at different options of what it takes to help bridge the auto industry so they're a part of not only a revived economy, but part of an energy policy going forward where America is less dependent on foreign oil.
[01:01:28.006 --> 01:01:29.967]  This is IRN USA Radio News.

[01:02:31.465 --> 01:02:34.568]  Israel and the Palestinians vowed to press on for peace.
[01:02:35.128 --> 01:02:44.657]  Backed by international mediators, the two sides today pledged to continue talks that President Bush launched even though a possible deal won't happen until Bush's term ends.
[01:02:45.464 --> 01:02:48.406]  Condoleezza Rice has been part of the negotiations.
[01:02:48.706 --> 01:02:59.314]  I believe that the Annapolis process is now the international community's answer and the party's answer to how do we finally end the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.
[01:02:59.394 --> 01:03:06.019]  Fighting in Congo has resumed and that has doctors concerned about a cholera epidemic if infected patients scatter to escape.
[01:03:06.579 --> 01:03:13.324]  Doctors are trying to contain the outbreak in a sprawling refugee camp near Congo's eastern provincial capital of Goma.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:21.662]  And there's evidence even people not normally thought to be at major risk can reduce their chances of a heart attack using a cholesterol drug.
[01:03:22.222 --> 01:03:24.963]  A large study finds taking Crestor can help.

[01:04:10.209 --> 01:04:13.133]  The school owner is charged with involuntary manslaughter.
[01:04:18.996 --> 01:04:23.940]  There's been a suicide bombing in Fallujah, a tiny town just 40 miles from Baghdad.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.461]  Here's Ryan Lucas.
[01:04:25.822 --> 01:04:31.426]  A female suicide bomber blew herself up at a hospital near Fallujah in Anbar Province.
[01:04:31.606 --> 01:04:34.148]  There were three people killed in the attack, five people wounded.
[01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:37.451]  Among the killed, there were two women and a 10-year-old girl.
[01:04:37.651 --> 01:04:41.334]  And among the wounded, there was a doctor at the hospital and her husband.
[01:04:41.494 --> 01:04:47.319]  Cuba's coast is flooded and hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated due to Hurricane Paloma's strike today.
[01:04:47.939 --> 01:04:53.504]  The ferocious storm hit as a Category 4 hurricane, but quickly weakened to a tropical storm.
[01:04:53.984 --> 01:04:56.466]  Richard Posch is with the National Hurricane Center.
[01:04:56.666 --> 01:05:08.355]  Very strong westerly winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere have literally blown the top of it off, and so we expect this to dwindle down to just a weak area of low pressure in a couple of days.
[01:05:10.918 --> 01:05:16.422]  And to coincide with 11 a.m., which marked the end of World War I at 11 a.m.
[01:05:16.522 --> 01:05:25.687]  on November 11th, 1918, the chimes of London's Big Ben marks the beginning of the Remembrance Day ceremony for Britain's war dead.
[01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:29.730]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN USA Radio News.
[01:05:30.871 --> 01:05:31.511]  Question.
[01:05:31.711 --> 01:05:36.254]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:39.396]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[01:05:40.911 --> 01:05:41.431]  Question.
[01:05:41.751 --> 01:05:42.911]  Are you prepared?

[01:05:47.032 --> 01:05:47.572]  Question.
[01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:54.633]  Do you have 7 years of healthy food for your family?

[01:07:10.191 --> 01:07:12.132]  Alright, it's the second and final hour.
[01:07:12.172 --> 01:07:14.113]  I haven't even gotten into all my documentation.
[01:07:14.533 --> 01:07:15.654]  Clips of Obama.
[01:07:16.034 --> 01:07:17.655]  Obama pulling it down off his site.
[01:07:17.775 --> 01:07:19.336]  National Compulsory Service.
[01:07:20.016 --> 01:07:21.017]  Youth Brigades.
[01:07:21.117 --> 01:07:22.978]  Gun Confiscation Brigades.
[01:07:23.538 --> 01:07:25.019]  Domestic Spy Teams.
[01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:30.882]  I mean, this is going to make Nazi Germany and Russia under the Soviets look like child's play.
[01:07:31.002 --> 01:07:32.863]  He's pulled this off his presidential website.
[01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:34.844]  But we have it all right here.
[01:07:34.904 --> 01:07:37.446]  I've got a bunch of economic news, too.
[01:07:37.506 --> 01:07:50.196]  And mainstream media is admitting that the chemicals in the one plastic that became universal is sterilizing men all over the Western world.
[01:07:50.216 --> 01:07:51.958]  So I want to warn folks about that coming up, too.
[01:07:53.317 --> 01:07:54.558]  Let's just go to your calls right now.
[01:07:54.918 --> 01:08:00.764]  Jeremy in Tennessee says he's with a special operations group and they couldn't wake up to the new world order.
[01:08:00.804 --> 01:08:03.446]  He tried to warn them, tried to talk to them, but that's impossible.
[01:08:03.486 --> 01:08:09.311]  George Bush is a good Christian conservative, but now because Obama's in office, suddenly they're all worried and concerned.
[01:08:09.992 --> 01:08:10.712]  And yes, it's true.
[01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:16.117]  Cops and military generally, when Democrats get in and kind of go with the left step,
[01:08:16.818 --> 01:08:18.318]  See, these are legs on the New World Order.
[01:08:18.679 --> 01:08:22.240]  They take a step to the left, take a step to the right, step to the left, step to the right.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:25.621]  Right now it's a left step, and a big step with Barack Obama.
[01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:31.922]  But I've never seen, and my mother, you know, been a liberal, been a democrat, but you know, woken up in the last few decades.
[01:08:32.803 --> 01:08:34.483]  That doesn't mean becoming a conservative.
[01:08:34.523 --> 01:08:36.044]  The point is she's woken up to the bigger paradigm.
[01:08:36.664 --> 01:08:37.044]  She says,
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:38.961]  I'm scared, I'm concerned.
[01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:41.702]  She said, I've never seen them call somebody a messiah.
[01:08:42.223 --> 01:08:43.263]  The one, the leader.
[01:08:43.803 --> 01:08:45.864]  Folks, that's not what a free country does with a president.
[01:08:46.305 --> 01:08:47.585]  But anyways, I digress.
[01:08:47.986 --> 01:08:52.808]  The corporate system is doing that because they want him to do things they know are going to be very unpopular.
[01:08:54.109 --> 01:09:03.594]  Go ahead and make the point you're saying he's a godsend, he will actually wake people up with his openly fascistic agenda.
[01:09:04.695 --> 01:09:04.895]  Yes.
[01:09:06.178 --> 01:09:07.639]  Yeah, that's what I've seen.
[01:09:07.719 --> 01:09:11.281]  I've seen a lot of people freaking out in my area.
[01:09:11.762 --> 01:09:14.163]  I had another comment to say about something I learned from you.
[01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:25.291]  As NCOs, when we get a long weekend, we have to give a safety briefing to all our lower enlisted to make sure that over the weekend they don't do anything stupid, like drinking and driving or doing something of that nature.
[01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:32.615]  And, you know, military, believe it or not, we do a lot of good things because we do the right thing preached to us so much.
[01:09:33.116 --> 01:09:34.897]  So I had two soldiers on Friday night
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.764]  Call me about 2.30 in the morning to come pick them up because they had been drinking and their DD left them.
[01:09:40.325 --> 01:09:42.026]  So I did the right thing and went and got them.
[01:09:42.607 --> 01:09:49.154]  And they wanted to eat, so we walked to the restaurant, which was only about 70 meters from where they were at.
[01:09:49.694 --> 01:09:55.260]  And on the way back, I had a cop pull over and was about to arrest us for walking on the side of the road.
[01:09:56.341 --> 01:09:57.462]  Yeah, because the country's so free.
[01:09:58.197 --> 01:10:01.440]  Yeah, so I did what I learned from you by watching your movies.
[01:10:01.981 --> 01:10:06.545]  I didn't stop even though he was telling me to stop because I hadn't done nothing wrong and I had not been drinking.
[01:10:06.585 --> 01:10:07.466]  I was just picking him up.
[01:10:08.327 --> 01:10:19.217]  So he called another police officer to make me stop and then they completely detained me and I told the cop straight to his face I wish I'd had a camera but I didn't know this was going to happen.
[01:10:19.724 --> 01:10:26.394]  But I told him what I learned from you is that, hey, you may beat the rap right now because you've got a gun and a badge and backup, but you're not going to beat the ride.
[01:10:26.414 --> 01:10:29.218]  And I told him straight to his face that I'm not going to sue Tennessee.
[01:10:29.619 --> 01:10:31.081]  I'm not going to sue your police.
[01:10:31.121 --> 01:10:31.963]  I want to sue you.
[01:10:32.563 --> 01:10:32.784]  You know?
[01:10:33.425 --> 01:10:36.167]  And it took about 20 minutes but they finally just let us go.
[01:10:36.187 --> 01:10:36.847]  But why?
[01:10:37.047 --> 01:10:42.871]  Why when you go protest do they come pose as protesters and beat people up and then arrest everybody?
[01:10:43.932 --> 01:10:46.814]  Why do they come and say you can't walk down the street in America?
[01:10:47.174 --> 01:10:49.115]  Why are we treated like scum?
[01:10:49.756 --> 01:10:54.379]  And then why are we bad when we say we don't want you to do this to us?
[01:10:55.191 --> 01:10:57.415]  I don't know, but I told him that he was civilian.
[01:10:57.495 --> 01:10:59.578]  I said, you know, you need to get out of this mentality.
[01:10:59.618 --> 01:11:00.780]  You're state-funded.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.781]  You're not civilian.
[01:11:02.102 --> 01:11:03.744]  Oh, he was calling you a civilian?
[01:11:04.325 --> 01:11:07.290]  Yeah, and I said, no, you're a civilian.
[01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:08.111]  I'm not a civilian.
[01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:10.475]  It's all military nomenclature, though.
[01:11:10.795 --> 01:11:23.306]  Well, no, I know the military is made up of the very best people in the country, but we have a lot of family, and they're so gung-ho, they love America so much, and they're so blind, though, to the programming, I'm like, don't you understand they're dismantling what the country is?
[01:11:23.766 --> 01:11:33.515]  And a lot of cops are good, too, it's just they've been taught, you've got the authority, you've got to maintain control of the situation, you've got to keep these people in line, and it's sad.
[01:11:34.147 --> 01:11:36.888]  Well, the cop was so arrogant and so cocky with me.
[01:11:37.148 --> 01:11:38.148]  I know, it's disgusting.
[01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:41.889]  I was saying, sir, and I was answering his questions, but I guess... So how did this end?
[01:11:41.909 --> 01:11:46.251]  I mean, did you say, so I'm not allowed to eat food in America, just not allowed to be here?
[01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:48.231]  I just said, well, what did we do wrong?
[01:11:48.251 --> 01:11:51.212]  You know, I told him I threw the amendments, you know, hey, what's your probable cause?
[01:11:51.252 --> 01:11:51.872]  What are we doing wrong?
[01:11:52.193 --> 01:11:53.473]  They asked for my driver's license.
[01:11:53.513 --> 01:11:54.273]  I wouldn't give it to them.
[01:11:54.313 --> 01:11:56.574]  I said, tell me what I did wrong and I'll do it, you know?
[01:11:56.994 --> 01:12:02.196]  And they, you know, finally, they just had to let us go because they realized, man, you know, this guy knows what he's talking about, you know?
[01:12:02.256 --> 01:12:03.336]  What did they say when they left?
[01:12:04.133 --> 01:12:06.534]  They finally just said, alright, are you guys going to your car?
[01:12:06.574 --> 01:12:07.975]  I said, yeah, it's 2.30 in the morning.
[01:12:08.495 --> 01:12:12.397]  But there's always a control issue, and of course they can say they thought you were criminals or whatever.
[01:12:12.858 --> 01:12:23.823]  The point is, is that he should be glad because of you, not just your service, but also that service, defending the Republic, defending the basic Bill of Rights, what the country really is.
[01:12:24.243 --> 01:12:26.184]  His children may grow up in a free country.
[01:12:26.224 --> 01:12:29.066]  Probably won't, but he's got some glimmer of hope.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:30.601]  Well, you're a great person, Alex.
[01:12:30.621 --> 01:12:31.581]  You just keep doing what you're doing.
[01:12:31.601 --> 01:12:33.162]  There's a lot of people out there that agree with you 100%.
[01:12:33.803 --> 01:12:34.763]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:36.604]  You know, I'm not that great of a person, folks.
[01:12:36.664 --> 01:12:43.589]  When I find out there's a criminal group running my country, brainwashing the police and military, turning us into a police state, I get mad.
[01:12:44.549 --> 01:12:50.653]  And then, I've had people calling, people I've known, saying, oh, I'm glad he's going to ban talk radio.
[01:12:50.693 --> 01:12:53.335]  I'm glad he's going to ban free speech, Barack Obama.
[01:12:53.415 --> 01:12:55.076]  I'm glad he's creating youth brigades.
[01:12:55.956 --> 01:12:58.438]  I'm glad that they're going to restrict the Internet.
[01:13:00.539 --> 01:13:11.685]  And, you know, all these Democrats who didn't like George Bush doing the same stuff, now that Barack Obama comes in, suddenly they're, oh yeah, I'm all for that now!
[01:13:14.406 --> 01:13:21.610]  Just like everybody who was against Bill Clinton, and all the corrupt things he was doing, moving the ball on the field for the New World Order, that's all it is, they're on the same team.
[01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:28.193]  They were, as soon as George Bush got in, they're like, you know what, I love it now, I love the police state now.
[01:13:29.403 --> 01:13:30.023]  Well, get ready.
[01:13:30.063 --> 01:13:30.884]  What's funny, Paul?
[01:13:32.905 --> 01:13:34.286]  He just keeps laughing in there.
[01:13:37.789 --> 01:13:39.430]  People are not lucky I'm even here today.
[01:13:39.490 --> 01:13:40.851]  I've got this chest cold, man.
[01:13:41.871 --> 01:13:42.592]  It is painful.
[01:13:42.612 --> 01:13:44.233]  All right, let's go ahead.
[01:13:47.335 --> 01:13:48.195]  Who's up next here?
[01:13:50.157 --> 01:13:55.500]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air for calling in to talk radio and even caring about liberty.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.601]  You're probably with Al Qaeda.
[01:13:57.389 --> 01:13:58.610]  Yes, Alex, can you hear me?
[01:13:58.690 --> 01:13:59.851]  Yes, Al-Qaeda, I'm here.
[01:14:01.091 --> 01:14:01.592]  Yes, hello?
[01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:02.392]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:14:02.973 --> 01:14:04.053]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:14:04.133 --> 01:14:05.995]  I'd like to discuss two things quickly.
[01:14:06.055 --> 01:14:07.416]  Two Gs, guns and GM.
[01:14:08.676 --> 01:14:15.341]  Today I went to the gun show outside of Cameroon, Texas, and I mean to tell you, it was so crowded that you could hardly walk.
[01:14:15.481 --> 01:14:16.682]  Yeah, record gun sales.
[01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:17.682]  That's been in the New York Times.
[01:14:17.842 --> 01:14:21.805]  Never before have more guns or ammo been sold because the people know.
[01:14:23.087 --> 01:14:29.592]  And let me ask you, I bought me a World War II era M1 carbine rifle, .30 caliber.
[01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.814]  Is that a pretty good choice for a defense weapon?
[01:14:33.694 --> 01:14:43.681]  Well, I'm not like an armorer or something from the Army, but yeah, the little .30 cals, that's good up close, and it'll certainly make somebody think twice they get hit with a couple of those.
[01:14:44.442 --> 01:14:44.922]  Absolutely.
[01:14:44.942 --> 01:14:50.386]  I mean, if I could have, say, one gun, one rifle, it'd probably be something like an M14 .308.
[01:14:52.617 --> 01:14:59.241]  Well, I've talked to several World War II veterans and they told me that they were able to take out guys with machine guns because they were good shots.
[01:14:59.541 --> 01:15:00.382]  Oh, no, absolutely.
[01:15:00.422 --> 01:15:01.722]  That's a good little lightweight.
[01:15:02.303 --> 01:15:06.825]  I mean, something comparable as a .223 range rifle or a Mini-14.
[01:15:06.986 --> 01:15:08.326]  I've got one of those.
[01:15:09.587 --> 01:15:11.528]  Shot up some wild hogs this weekend with them.
[01:15:12.289 --> 01:15:15.931]  And the other gun I bought was an old West Single Action .45 Long Colt.
[01:15:16.711 --> 01:15:18.032]  Because I like the old cowboy guns.
[01:15:18.532 --> 01:15:20.994]  Is that... nothing wrong with that, right?
[01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:23.971]  There's nothing, you know what, it's all about your will.
[01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:24.571]  Right.
[01:15:24.631 --> 01:15:26.332]  Let's say you're defending the Republic from enemies.
[01:15:26.732 --> 01:15:30.253]  You can have any gun you want, any handgun, any rifle, with a knife.
[01:15:30.894 --> 01:15:31.074]  Mm-hmm.
[01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:35.416]  You know, just, I mean, so, when it comes down to it, yes, those are wonderful firearms, sir.
[01:15:36.516 --> 01:15:37.776]  And, uh, but today, guess what?
[01:15:37.817 --> 01:15:41.498]  I tried to find some .45 Long Colt, uh, ammunition, and it was totally sold out.
[01:15:41.558 --> 01:15:42.278]  I could not believe it.
[01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.859]  Yeah, that .45 Long Colt, that's a neat round.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.721]  It also shoots the old, uh, lever-action rifles.
[01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:49.641]  That's what's good about it.
[01:15:50.121 --> 01:15:51.262]  The ammo's interchangeable.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.561]  Sir, every gun I've got's going up in value.
[01:15:55.641 --> 01:15:58.343]  I mean, I don't want to say how many rifles and handguns I've got.
[01:15:58.823 --> 01:15:59.023]  Right.
[01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:00.464]  But it's a large amount.
[01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:03.545]  And, uh, let's just say this, I love them all to death.
[01:16:04.866 --> 01:16:20.033]  Yeah, I think, uh... Look, look, these parasites in government that want to make us their slaves, and all their brainwashed jellyfish servants, and all their weak-minded people that follow them, they hate it that we're still armed, because that means we're not the New World Order's total slaves yet.
[01:16:20.828 --> 01:16:21.931]  And so they're very upset.
[01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:22.974]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:25.481]  We're going to continue with Chris.
[01:16:25.561 --> 01:16:26.223]  Isaiah, Chris?
[01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:32.995]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[01:16:33.275 --> 01:16:35.897]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[01:16:36.197 --> 01:16:44.524]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[01:16:44.804 --> 01:16:47.646]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[01:16:48.487 --> 01:16:51.709]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:54.612]  How much are you willing to lose?
[01:16:54.992 --> 01:16:55.913]  Take action now!
[01:16:56.053 --> 01:16:59.935]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[01:17:00.856 --> 01:17:04.618]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[01:17:04.838 --> 01:17:08.060]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:14.604]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[01:17:14.904 --> 01:17:20.429]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:22.972]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[01:17:23.192 --> 01:17:24.894]  Call me, John Humer, at 1-800-686-2237 extension 129.
[01:17:30.251 --> 01:17:33.513]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[01:17:33.693 --> 01:17:37.775]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[01:17:37.935 --> 01:17:49.360]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:55.423]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[01:17:55.503 --> 01:17:55.963]  I think so.
[01:18:16.101 --> 01:18:17.082]  We're good to go.
[01:18:30.592 --> 01:18:31.792]  I am so frustrated.
[01:18:31.892 --> 01:18:34.033]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[01:18:34.233 --> 01:18:34.533]  What?
[01:18:34.813 --> 01:18:37.394]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[01:18:37.574 --> 01:18:38.834]  I read something and forget.
[01:18:38.974 --> 01:18:40.155]  I forget people's names.
[01:18:40.235 --> 01:18:43.896]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[01:18:44.036 --> 01:18:45.676]  I... Okay, slow down.
[01:18:45.776 --> 01:18:48.217]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:55.379]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[01:18:55.499 --> 01:18:56.939]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[01:18:57.119 --> 01:18:58.660]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:18:59.780]  Even entire books.
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:00.220]  What?
[01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:00.621]  How?
[01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:04.064]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[01:19:04.124 --> 01:19:07.787]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[01:19:07.887 --> 01:19:17.176]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information, including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[01:19:17.537 --> 01:19:22.721]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time-limit, money-back guarantee.
[01:19:22.922 --> 01:19:23.222]  Wow.
[01:19:23.442 --> 01:19:24.223]  What's the website?
[01:19:24.443 --> 01:19:27.705]  Now don't forget, it's pmemory.net.
[01:19:27.905 --> 01:19:29.986]  The letter P, memory dot net.
[01:19:30.486 --> 01:19:34.128]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[01:19:34.188 --> 01:19:39.831]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[01:19:39.931 --> 01:19:43.973]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[01:19:44.253 --> 01:19:46.554]  Nature's gem, premium omega-3.
[01:19:46.714 --> 01:19:52.517]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing cooler temperatures
[01:19:52.517 --> 01:19:53.158]  We're good to go!
[01:20:09.915 --> 01:20:11.356]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:12.257]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:52.319 --> 01:21:01.867]  I could sit here all night and talk about other issues and take phone calls, and we are, but... I mean, did you know that the world really is run by a private group of families that own the private banks?
[01:21:02.848 --> 01:21:18.160]  And they openly admitted that they were gonna cause our markets to implode and terrorize us into giving them total governmental power and then looting our entire treasuries to fund themselves and not help the people or fund the economy?
[01:21:19.361 --> 01:21:20.662]  They're the ones killing the economy.
[01:21:21.488 --> 01:21:35.417]  And then now they're setting up a world government for and by the private banks where they will have control over all the nations of the world's finances and where they will regulate the stock markets when they're the ones that engineered all this.
[01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.498]  And they're calling it a new world order.
[01:21:38.379 --> 01:21:46.024]  And meanwhile, the public's talking about, you know, Texas Tech and LSU or, you know, what happened with the Easter Bunny, you know, coming up.
[01:21:47.392 --> 01:21:51.354]  And so all I can say is believe whatever you want, say whatever you want.
[01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:54.015]  I'm telling you the truth, and we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:21:54.435 --> 01:22:00.077]  The history of the planet is tyrannical governments taking control and abusing the populations really bad.
[01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:05.379]  And if you want to be naive, suckers, go ahead, but let me tell you something, folks.
[01:22:06.219 --> 01:22:12.542]  Barack Hussein Obama is going to really get a lot done for the New World Order.
[01:22:14.091 --> 01:22:15.432]  And just sit back and watch.
[01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:20.496]  You can be suckers if you want, and even think this guy's president or runs anything, but he doesn't.
[01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:25.100]  When they get these emails going, you just can't imagine a black man being president.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:30.204]  No, honey, I was saying that George Bush was a puppet and Bill Clinton was a puppet.
[01:22:30.824 --> 01:22:31.845]  And those are white guys.
[01:22:32.265 --> 01:22:33.266]  That's not what this is.
[01:22:34.807 --> 01:22:36.449]  Just mindlessness.
[01:22:36.989 --> 01:22:40.312]  They can't even get their minds past that into real issues.
[01:22:42.597 --> 01:22:44.738]  But you can't get the yuppies to talk about the New World Order.
[01:22:44.758 --> 01:22:46.219]  It can be all over the financial pages.
[01:22:46.539 --> 01:22:49.980]  It can be happening, but they were preconditioned that it didn't exist, so they just say it doesn't exist.
[01:22:50.601 --> 01:22:51.141]  Hey, that's fine.
[01:22:51.461 --> 01:22:55.903]  Watch them take your 401k and your pension, and watch the New World Order devalue your currency.
[01:22:56.163 --> 01:22:56.763]  Go ahead!
[01:22:57.864 --> 01:22:58.824]  You like being idiots?
[01:22:58.864 --> 01:22:59.365]  Go ahead.
[01:22:59.445 --> 01:23:01.946]  Don't let me get in the way of your happiness and success, as they say.
[01:23:04.267 --> 01:23:06.568]  I got all these... There's a different phone system every week in here.
[01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:09.149]  This one isn't showing me how long the caller's been on hold.
[01:23:12.412 --> 01:23:13.833]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:23:17.136 --> 01:23:17.977]  Call number six.
[01:23:18.598 --> 01:23:20.339]  Line six has been holding a long time.
[01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.361]  John and Austin, you're on the air.
[01:23:22.421 --> 01:23:22.761]  Welcome.
[01:23:25.244 --> 01:23:25.864]  Hello, John.
[01:23:25.924 --> 01:23:26.805]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:23:26.845 --> 01:23:27.586]  Oh, good, good, good.
[01:23:28.126 --> 01:23:32.390]  Hey, I just want to say thanks for all the good work you're doing.
[01:23:32.911 --> 01:23:34.552]  I know you're a very humble person.
[01:23:34.592 --> 01:23:35.153]  I just want to
[01:23:35.771 --> 01:23:37.732]  Throw a quote at you from Thomas Jefferson.
[01:23:37.772 --> 01:23:44.314]  He said, all tyranny needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent.
[01:23:45.274 --> 01:24:01.760]  And, you know, the longer that silence is out there, we're going to head down the doom and gloom that you've been... Yeah, the actual quote is, I mean it was a great one, you paraphrased, is that all that evil men and tyrants seek to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[01:24:02.392 --> 01:24:03.272]  Right.
[01:24:03.292 --> 01:24:12.595]  And boy, look at tyranny flourishing, because the public's looking at iPods and look at the latest bling, and they have no idea that systematic tyranny has come to our shores.
[01:24:13.395 --> 01:24:25.718]  Yeah, I was watching the McLaughlin Group this morning, and they went into this little piece about the meeting on November the 14th or the 15th, World Economic Meeting.
[01:24:25.738 --> 01:24:28.299]  Yeah, the new Bretton Woods, the end of the dollar, basically.
[01:24:29.076 --> 01:24:35.100]  Right, and so they started talking about globalization, so I was thinking, wow, okay, they're gonna discuss this, right?
[01:24:35.721 --> 01:24:41.185]  So they come back to the group, and they said, uh, Barack's hands are tied on this one.
[01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:42.846]  Okay, next topic.
[01:24:43.286 --> 01:24:46.709]  You know, the world bathed in the glory of Barack Obama.
[01:24:46.909 --> 01:24:50.872]  Now that's what they're saying, is that both parties are not going to discuss it.
[01:24:51.272 --> 01:24:55.435]  We're handing everything over, including governmental power, to private banks in England.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:05.506]  I'm curious about the situation with the Attorney General.
[01:25:05.606 --> 01:25:09.109]  Is there any hope?
[01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:14.453]  As far as a real Attorney General that's going to come in there?
[01:25:15.365 --> 01:25:22.206]  And, uh, taking from 9-11 and... No, I mean, usually our Attorney Generals are foreign intelligence operatives, so, uh, no.
[01:25:22.647 --> 01:25:24.287]  And by the way, I was wrong the last hour.
[01:25:24.727 --> 01:25:31.548]  I didn't pay a lot of attention to Senate races, and I knew that Ted Stevens and Baggage were neck and neck, and then I've seen Baggage ahead.
[01:25:31.568 --> 01:25:40.710]  Uh, in Alaska, uh, Ted Stevens with seven convictions, uh, is in the lead right now, but it's still being contested.
[01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:43.711]  So, whatever.
[01:25:44.304 --> 01:25:46.266]  There's the basics with that.
[01:25:47.027 --> 01:25:53.953]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Bode in Ohio.
[01:25:53.973 --> 01:25:55.835]  Do things bode well, Bode?
[01:25:55.895 --> 01:25:56.256]  Welcome.
[01:25:56.576 --> 01:25:56.856]  Hi.
[01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:57.857]  Peace to the world.
[01:25:57.897 --> 01:25:58.778]  It's actually Daoud.
[01:25:59.399 --> 01:26:01.241]  I can understand why they didn't quite get it.
[01:26:01.321 --> 01:26:02.822]  Daoud, welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:26:03.082 --> 01:26:03.303]  Yes.
[01:26:03.463 --> 01:26:05.585]  First of all, I have to just let you know who you're speaking to.
[01:26:05.765 --> 01:26:07.747]  I am an African American male.
[01:26:08.482 --> 01:26:17.305]  I'm 51 years old, and I have never supported Barack Obama, and I am catching a lot of flack from both whites and blacks out here in Columbus, Ohio.
[01:26:17.385 --> 01:26:20.606]  I bet the whites are really arrogant and on power trips.
[01:26:21.087 --> 01:26:23.027]  I'm not racist, you are!
[01:26:23.447 --> 01:26:24.228]  You don't like him.
[01:26:24.528 --> 01:26:29.289]  What is so amazing is when I ask them any questions about what they know about him, no one knows anything.
[01:26:29.329 --> 01:26:30.690]  Everybody's wearing t-shirts.
[01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:32.290]  It is so crazy.
[01:26:32.591 --> 01:26:33.571]  Yeah, all I know is...
[01:26:34.494 --> 01:26:37.937]  He is more handsome than Bush and knows how to give a speech better.
[01:26:38.258 --> 01:26:41.501]  But if you look at who runs him, it's total New World Order.
[01:26:42.142 --> 01:26:44.544]  Well, when I start talking about the corporate dictatorship...
[01:26:45.211 --> 01:26:54.095]  That we have in this country, we've had for many, many years, and I start talking to him about the history that this country has been, the history of this country has been fighting against central banks.
[01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:54.855]  That's it.
[01:26:55.015 --> 01:26:59.337]  And I break out so many different historical facts and people start, really?
[01:26:59.437 --> 01:26:59.717]  Really?
[01:26:59.797 --> 01:27:00.057]  Really?
[01:27:00.077 --> 01:27:02.618]  And I said, do you understand why Lincoln was assassinated?
[01:27:02.638 --> 01:27:06.000]  Do you understand why Andrew Jackson was attempted to be assassinated?
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:08.461]  It all had to do with the central bankers.
[01:27:08.941 --> 01:27:12.583]  Exactly, that's it, because if you control the issuance of money, you're king dog!
[01:27:12.843 --> 01:27:14.504]  Doesn't matter what anybody does!
[01:27:14.524 --> 01:27:31.373]  There are two quotes which I throw out and people listen to me after I throw them out, and one is a Financial Times, excuse me, Times of London editorial from 1863, which came out right after Lincoln decided to print greenbacks.
[01:27:32.086 --> 01:27:35.568]  And talk about the directness of the New World Order.
[01:27:35.988 --> 01:27:38.269]  And it reads, I'm going to try to read this real quickly.
[01:27:38.689 --> 01:27:54.195]  If this mischievous financial policy, meaning a government actually controlling its own currency, which has its origin in North America, shall become enduring down to a fixture, then that government will furnish its own money without cost.
[01:27:54.735 --> 01:27:57.196]  It will pay off debts and be without debt.
[01:27:57.657 --> 01:28:00.858]  It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce,
[01:28:01.403 --> 01:28:01.583]  I think?
[01:28:18.969 --> 01:28:20.751]  I know.
[01:28:21.472 --> 01:28:27.138]  In fact, I even sent off, years ago, when I was making a banking documentary, I never finished, for the Real Times of London.
[01:28:27.759 --> 01:28:28.780]  And that was really in there.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.583]  And the banking associations here were saying that.
[01:28:32.379 --> 01:28:37.923]  And that's why Burr went out and killed Alexander Hamilton because he was trying to push that through.
[01:28:38.043 --> 01:28:44.247]  Our whole country, our whole world is run by these people and Obama is literally their man.
[01:28:44.267 --> 01:28:47.069]  He is such a puppet.
[01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:48.210]  It is unbelievable.
[01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:54.754]  It just really hurts me because as a black man growing up here in the United States of America,
[01:28:55.847 --> 01:29:03.333]  You get a lot of messages that try to tell you and convince you that you're not a full-fledged citizen of the United States.
[01:29:03.914 --> 01:29:06.016]  And I can tell you, even I come from a large family.
[01:29:06.036 --> 01:29:08.357]  I have eight sisters and three brothers who are living.
[01:29:08.818 --> 01:29:12.541]  And I never accepted, never accepted any of those messages.
[01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:12.981]  Say what?
[01:29:13.001 --> 01:29:13.862]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:29:13.902 --> 01:29:14.763]  I'm going to go to the news.
[01:29:14.803 --> 01:29:15.443]  Can you hold over?
[01:29:17.145 --> 01:29:18.165]  You can hold over, right?
[01:29:18.205 --> 01:29:18.706]  Yes, yes.
[01:29:19.106 --> 01:29:20.127]  I want to come back and hear this.
[01:29:20.507 --> 01:29:20.988]  Stay with us.
[01:29:21.368 --> 01:29:24.671]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:29:30.461 --> 01:29:35.902]  With Christmas right around the corner and an unstable economy looming, finding the right gift can be tough.

[01:30:30.612 --> 01:30:36.194]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[01:30:36.854 --> 01:30:50.599]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[01:30:50.799 --> 01:30:53.120]  What else can three oxygen atoms, in other words,
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:54.041]  Ozone do?
[01:30:54.321 --> 01:30:58.846]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[01:30:59.106 --> 01:31:00.968]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[01:31:01.188 --> 01:31:04.452]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[01:31:04.752 --> 01:31:11.339]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.

[01:31:32.794 --> 01:31:38.977]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[01:31:39.757 --> 01:31:49.903]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[01:31:50.383 --> 01:31:51.303]  Well, snap out of it.
[01:31:51.323 --> 01:31:52.324]  We now have a deadline.
[01:31:52.824 --> 01:31:54.285]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[01:31:54.845 --> 01:32:06.188]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[01:32:06.748 --> 01:32:12.450]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:17.771]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[01:32:18.311 --> 01:32:22.052]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[01:32:22.653 --> 01:32:23.896]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com

[01:32:56.129 --> 01:32:58.210]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the U.S.
[01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.750]  this fall?

[01:33:26.563 --> 01:33:29.025]  Act now!
[01:33:33.168 --> 01:33:37.931]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communication Radio Network.
[01:33:46.795 --> 01:33:56.921]  Alright, folks, we are back live, taking your phone calls in response to last week's election, the 44th president, Barack Obama.
[01:33:59.342 --> 01:34:09.808]  Yeah, let me just say this, what I hate about it is, is that I'd love to be able to support America's first, you know, president who's got African blood in him, because, you know, that'd be wonderful.
[01:34:10.428 --> 01:34:15.491]  The problem is, I don't support any of these presidents since Kennedy, and they blew his head off because he didn't play ball.
[01:34:16.303 --> 01:34:17.904]  And we had bad presidents before that.
[01:34:19.365 --> 01:34:22.646]  Woodrow Wilson started speaking out, saying, look, I got conned by some private banks.
[01:34:23.087 --> 01:34:24.327]  I didn't know this was a takeover.
[01:34:24.627 --> 01:34:25.608]  Suddenly they poison him.
[01:34:26.849 --> 01:34:27.769]  He goes into a coma.
[01:34:28.890 --> 01:34:33.372]  Then he comes out of the coma and writes letters publicly exposing it again, saying he thought he was poisoned.
[01:34:33.972 --> 01:34:36.033]  I mean, that's mainline information, folks.
[01:34:36.454 --> 01:34:39.315]  The average people, though, aren't aware even who Woodrow Wilson was.
[01:34:39.695 --> 01:34:44.638]  He was our president back in 1913, when we got the private fellow reserve, when we got the income tax.
[01:34:46.267 --> 01:34:58.394]  And you can read all the documents of the bankers, books they wrote, things they say, they're doing it now, and it's so painful because it is positive that people are getting along better.
[01:34:59.254 --> 01:35:12.261]  That a lot of people, I've talked to a lot of black folks that I know, are saying, yeah, man, I understand that Barack Obama is owned by the very same people, and quote, owned by the man, but at least it says that a whole bunch of white folks voted for a black guy.
[01:35:13.152 --> 01:35:15.633]  And so there is that good news, but let me tell you something.
[01:35:15.653 --> 01:35:16.353]  Here's the bad news.
[01:35:17.273 --> 01:35:21.354]  When they are done with Barack Obama, they're going to blame everything on him.
[01:35:21.374 --> 01:35:23.294]  Just like George Bush, it's birdcage liner.
[01:35:23.774 --> 01:35:30.376]  They come in with a honeymoon, they get a bunch done, the New World Order bird soils everything and the birdcage liner gets blamed.
[01:35:30.656 --> 01:35:32.316]  They pull that out and stick a new one in.
[01:35:33.877 --> 01:35:40.358]  Let me tell you, for folks watching here locally in Austin on television on Channel 10, you see this right here?
[01:35:41.578 --> 01:35:43.280]  Barack Obama, that's just bird cage liner.
[01:35:43.881 --> 01:35:45.383]  They're just going to place him up in there.
[01:35:46.104 --> 01:35:48.527]  And the bird, that's the New World Order, is going to do his business.
[01:35:49.268 --> 01:35:51.170]  Why don't we talk about the bird?
[01:35:51.831 --> 01:35:54.194]  The creature that's doing this?
[01:35:54.234 --> 01:35:56.617]  Going back to our caller in Ohio.
[01:35:57.739 --> 01:36:00.641]  I don't want to butcher his name again, so I'll just let him state his name when he comes back on.
[01:36:00.681 --> 01:36:12.109]  You had one more quote, sir, and you were talking about growing up, the images of the bling, the image of the culture, the corporations pick out to try to stereotype black males especially.
[01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:20.835]  I mean, I'm putting words in your mouth, but you were about to get to that, versus what reality is and how you didn't listen to the propaganda, and then you were going to continue.
[01:36:20.855 --> 01:36:21.216]  Go ahead.
[01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:22.757]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:36:23.664 --> 01:36:26.185]  I was really fortunate growing up in Newark, New Jersey.
[01:36:26.266 --> 01:36:33.990]  I grew up in the East and my teachers that we had all the way through were exceptional and they really made sure we all were educated.
[01:36:34.090 --> 01:36:37.852]  Even the dumbest guy in my class would be an A student today.
[01:36:38.803 --> 01:36:43.727]  And they cared about education, and that was really out of the Eisenhower mold.
[01:36:44.207 --> 01:36:48.430]  Eisenhower was such a key in all the things that happened for all of us going through the 60s.
[01:36:49.110 --> 01:37:03.260]  And just even within my family, though, it's just been an oddity, because I just never understood why other people in my own family saw things so differently to me, because I really did believe the things that we were taught about being a United States citizen all the way through.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:07.223]  And I never thought I'd live to see the day that Russia would be telling my government
[01:37:08.169 --> 01:37:11.671]  Not to start a war, meaning the Iraq War, and they were absolutely right.
[01:37:13.311 --> 01:37:27.458]  So I just really ask everyone out there, regardless of what your group is, to really understand the history of this great nation that we have, and fully understand things before we speak, and we need to get out there and challenge this government.
[01:37:27.798 --> 01:37:33.341]  Another point I wanted to make is that I've asked many people, black and white, if they knew who Crispus Attucks was.
[01:37:34.429 --> 01:37:35.670]  And most people don't even know!
[01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:42.232]  I think you're happy about having a black president, and you don't even know the history of the revolution and who Crispus Attucks was.
[01:37:42.272 --> 01:37:43.033]  I say, because you know what?
[01:37:43.073 --> 01:37:45.754]  You may be looking at another Crispus Attucks looking at me right now.
[01:37:45.874 --> 01:37:47.415]  Why don't you tell folks who it is?
[01:37:47.815 --> 01:37:52.697]  Crispus Attucks was the first person, he was African, who died in the Revolutionary War.
[01:37:53.837 --> 01:37:57.199]  And people forget that, that there was a struggle here from day one.
[01:37:58.257 --> 01:37:59.838]  Against international bankers.
[01:38:00.138 --> 01:38:04.301]  And the one quote I want to leave with, real quickly, is from Otto von Bismarck.
[01:38:04.341 --> 01:38:06.282]  And I got this out of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:38:06.562 --> 01:38:13.367]  And he was quoted after Lincoln had been assassinated, regarding the impact that this was going to have on the world.
[01:38:14.127 --> 01:38:17.529]  The death of Lincoln was a disaster for Christendom.
[01:38:17.909 --> 01:38:21.492]  There was no man in the United States great enough to wear his boots.
[01:38:22.332 --> 01:38:26.595]  I fear that foreign bankers, with their craftiness and torturous tricks,
[01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:27.290]  Beautiful.
[01:38:45.914 --> 01:38:46.955]  No, I mean exactly.
[01:38:47.015 --> 01:38:50.578]  And back then, people even knew who the enemy was and we couldn't beat them.
[01:38:51.039 --> 01:38:59.306]  Now the public doesn't even know and laughs at bankers while they're openly setting up world government run by them and we're going to have to buy carbon taxes from them.
[01:38:59.646 --> 01:39:00.707]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:39:00.747 --> 01:39:01.228]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:39:01.288 --> 01:39:01.848]  Peace to the world.
[01:39:01.988 --> 01:39:02.309]  You bet.
[01:39:02.349 --> 01:39:03.570]  Yeah, the guy's a great speaker.
[01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:04.431]  He needs a radio show.
[01:39:04.451 --> 01:39:04.791]  He does.
[01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:07.433]  I love that tone of voice and the way he was speaking.
[01:39:07.493 --> 01:39:08.975]  I just like it.
[01:39:09.955 --> 01:39:10.456]  Look at this.
[01:39:11.917 --> 01:39:12.718]  Look at this right here.
[01:39:14.309 --> 01:39:17.070]  This is out of Newsweek, and it's a cartoon.
[01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:18.490]  We'll show a close-up of this.
[01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:20.590]  I'll give this to you for the TV shows when we put it on.
[01:39:21.551 --> 01:39:24.571]  And it says, The Constitution Bill of Rights.
[01:39:25.091 --> 01:39:31.073]  It's a piece of paper, and Barack Obama is piecing it together with tape and fixing it, after Bush Cheney.
[01:39:33.553 --> 01:39:42.755]  Folks, Barack Obama, out of the gates, is saying, Patriot Act, warrantless spying, more wars, letting the bankers take over.
[01:39:45.615 --> 01:39:46.736]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:39:47.817 --> 01:39:56.222]  I mean, we've got this translucent green skin, George Bush, who just radiates deception and lies.
[01:39:57.323 --> 01:39:58.364]  Notice how they set that up.
[01:39:58.384 --> 01:39:59.024]  They're masters.
[01:39:59.425 --> 01:40:01.206]  Eight years of this, and they give us this.
[01:40:02.707 --> 01:40:03.227]  Hollywood.
[01:40:05.769 --> 01:40:08.631]  Just exudes confidence and smarts and slick.
[01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:09.711]  Good looking.
[01:40:10.071 --> 01:40:10.771]  It's over, folks.
[01:40:10.811 --> 01:40:11.292]  We're screwed.
[01:40:11.632 --> 01:40:12.052]  It's over.
[01:40:12.493 --> 01:40:17.837]  Because the public has just somehow been trained that all white guys, which really do run things, you know, are the evil.
[01:40:18.138 --> 01:40:20.319]  So they look at some old white guy down the street and think he's the evil one.
[01:40:20.379 --> 01:40:21.240]  No, he's not the evil one.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:25.424]  He's watching, you know, dancing with the stars just like you.
[01:40:26.625 --> 01:40:30.848]  But now that they've done this, man, this guy is going to carry the ball far.
[01:40:31.749 --> 01:40:33.430]  The New World Order's got its Vince Young.
[01:40:34.431 --> 01:40:36.373]  And he's going to carry the ball for them, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:40:37.384 --> 01:40:38.104]  It's your detriment.
[01:40:38.204 --> 01:40:42.205]  You'll be cheering your destruction all the way to the... Folks are going to wake up, though.
[01:40:42.245 --> 01:40:44.046]  I mean, let me tell you, they're going to destroy him in the end, though.
[01:40:44.906 --> 01:40:47.047]  They've got to do that so they can give you the new savior.
[01:40:47.467 --> 01:40:48.907]  Remember George Bush was the savior?
[01:40:49.227 --> 01:40:50.527]  Remember seven and a half years ago?
[01:40:50.868 --> 01:40:52.208]  He was the savior from Bill Clinton.
[01:40:52.648 --> 01:40:54.148]  Because Bill Clinton did stuff that was unpopular.
[01:40:54.429 --> 01:40:55.889]  Just like George Bush did stuff that was unpopular.
[01:40:56.169 --> 01:40:58.430]  And what's Obama saying every day in the papers now?
[01:40:58.990 --> 01:41:00.530]  I'm going to do stuff you're not going to like.
[01:41:00.630 --> 01:41:01.730]  See, he's getting you ready for it.
[01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:03.671]  I'm going to do stuff you're not going to like.
[01:41:04.938 --> 01:41:08.280]  I'm about to do what you don't want me to do, because he works for somebody else than us.
[01:41:10.341 --> 01:41:11.902]  Chris in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:41:11.962 --> 01:41:12.863]  Welcome to the airwaves.
[01:41:14.304 --> 01:41:21.608]  Who did the infamous Marcus Wolfe train at Homeland Security between 2002 and 2006 when he became deceased?
[01:41:21.668 --> 01:41:28.692]  Marcus Wolfe, the former head of the East German Stasi, trained a lot of people at Homeland Security, including Comrade Chertoff.
[01:41:30.213 --> 01:41:31.013]  Oh, I never knew that.
[01:41:31.234 --> 01:41:31.334]  Wow.
[01:41:32.304 --> 01:41:40.791]  Well, in this service economy, the new make-work is drafting the youth into a vast PI agency centralized in the government.
[01:41:41.131 --> 01:41:42.412]  And that's not us!
[01:41:42.832 --> 01:41:45.354]  Let's play Barack Obama saying it.
[01:41:45.394 --> 01:41:48.737]  And you read the fine print, Youth Brigade spying on Americans.
[01:41:48.757 --> 01:41:51.018]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:41:52.219 --> 01:41:59.305]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[01:42:00.163 --> 01:42:07.207]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:42:09.869 --> 01:42:10.609]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:42:11.690 --> 01:42:17.433]  So I guess now we're just going to be doing each other's laundry and putting each other in jail, but not always in that order.
[01:42:17.613 --> 01:42:18.394]  Well, here's an example.
[01:42:18.414 --> 01:42:23.597]  I've given a lot of money to Meals on Wheels, and then I heard that some of these groups bringing food to old folks,
[01:42:24.221 --> 01:42:29.266]  You know, uh, quote, we're trying to push psychological evaluations and, and, and Prozac and things on them.
[01:42:29.667 --> 01:42:31.528]  And then I saw News 8 Austin Friday morning.
[01:42:32.289 --> 01:42:39.216]  Sure enough, and then the next newscast was teaching kids about global warming and global taxes, and the next piece after that was another propaganda piece.
[01:42:39.656 --> 01:42:41.999]  I mean, we're just marinated in propaganda.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:47.104]  And they take every good thing we do and turn it into some government spy thing.
[01:42:48.306 --> 01:42:56.073]  About 20% of the people, about 17 to 20% are considered somnambulists, who are very easily suggestible.
[01:42:56.473 --> 01:43:08.424]  And there is also a recent study that when the brain has increased amounts of oxytocin released, for whatever reason, they're made glad or happy.
[01:43:08.444 --> 01:43:10.966]  They can be cheated over and over again by the same person.
[01:43:11.947 --> 01:43:12.847]  No, no, that's it.
[01:43:12.867 --> 01:43:15.630]  You ought to write a story and put it on the PrisonPlanet.com forum.
[01:43:16.770 --> 01:43:17.612]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:43:17.672 --> 01:43:18.533]  It's all hypnosis.
[01:43:18.573 --> 01:43:19.274]  It's all tricks.
[01:43:19.635 --> 01:43:20.396]  It's all scams.
[01:43:20.456 --> 01:43:23.140]  If you're aware of it, you might have a chance to beat it.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:25.944]  But if you deny it exists, it's over.
[01:43:25.964 --> 01:43:28.027]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[01:43:28.508 --> 01:43:29.109]  Stay with us.
[01:43:30.262 --> 01:43:39.367]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:43:39.527 --> 01:43:47.592]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:43:47.712 --> 01:43:52.234]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:43:52.314 --> 01:43:54.916]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[01:43:55.076 --> 01:43:57.477]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal,
[01:43:57.557 --> 01:43:58.597]  We're good to go!
[01:44:27.365 --> 01:44:33.229]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:36.971]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:44:37.451 --> 01:44:43.375]  Solar-powered generators are now available from Solutions from Science, one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors.
[01:44:43.755 --> 01:44:47.918]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[01:44:48.379 --> 01:44:54.143]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and produces electricity for free.
[01:44:54.403 --> 01:44:57.546]  It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[01:44:57.826 --> 01:45:02.250]  Run sump pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[01:45:02.490 --> 01:45:05.332]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts,
[01:45:05.592 --> 01:45:08.513]  You'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[01:45:08.693 --> 01:45:13.315]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready with the Solar Power Generator from Solutions from Science.

[01:45:34.022 --> 01:45:36.264]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:45:36.704 --> 01:45:41.447]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.

[01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:32.391]  Heart disease is on the rise.

[01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:34.931]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:35.711 --> 01:47:37.572]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:47.642]  You know, the media has taught us to be proud of the fact that we haven't read books or that we're not informed.
[01:47:49.703 --> 01:47:51.244]  That's actually not a good thing, folks.
[01:47:53.945 --> 01:47:57.007]  I hope you visit InfoWars.com, link through the Stenver Post article.
[01:47:57.847 --> 01:48:01.669]  Headline, uh, the probe into police staged the NC protest.
[01:48:02.129 --> 01:48:07.472]  The police went out and attacked other police as a pretext to demonize the protest in the eyes of the media.
[01:48:07.972 --> 01:48:09.873]  That's called the false flag right there.
[01:48:13.018 --> 01:48:27.163]  Obama Camp Scrubs website for removed references to mandatory community service, but it's still up there that old folks, young people, little kids, to be little tattletale squads, little environmental land grabbers, little government crooks.
[01:48:27.183 --> 01:48:31.024]  Of course, the government just collects it, though, and hands it to the bankers.
[01:48:33.065 --> 01:48:38.427]  And that's why Obama's smiling, because he is going to hurt you real bad for his masters.
[01:48:39.087 --> 01:48:39.947]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:48:40.327 --> 01:48:41.808]  He's got a Ted Bundy smile, doesn't he?
[01:48:42.808 --> 01:48:43.709]  Yeah.
[01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:46.731]  Gonna hurt you real bad, suckas.
[01:48:47.272 --> 01:48:51.455]  And I got a bunch of other news here.
[01:48:51.495 --> 01:48:59.502]  Let me give you some news that I can break down here pretty quick before I go to a bunch of final calls.
[01:49:02.344 --> 01:49:06.868]  This is the CBC, Canadian Broadcasting System, the disappearing mail.
[01:49:08.416 --> 01:49:16.000]  We're conducting a vast toxicological experiment in which our children and our children's children are the experimental subjects.
[01:49:16.541 --> 01:49:26.606]  Dr. Herman Needleman, The Disappearing Male, is about one of the most important and least publicized issues facing the human species, the toxic threat to the male reproductive system.
[01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:33.450]  And it goes into genital deformities, low sperm counts, sperm abnormalities, testicular cancer,
[01:49:34.594 --> 01:49:46.242]  And it goes on to admit, it is the one plastic of hundreds that was chosen and standardized about 50 years ago, sheds estrogen mimicking hormones.
[01:49:47.642 --> 01:49:55.508]  Now, it makes men feminine, or deforms their organs, but women it makes hyper-feminine and get breast cancer.
[01:49:55.988 --> 01:49:57.249]  I've got all the studies right here.
[01:49:57.529 --> 01:49:58.570]  Let me just give you a news flash.
[01:49:58.590 --> 01:50:00.691]  Don't take mercury shots, by the way, it's still in there.
[01:50:02.081 --> 01:50:07.063]  Don't drink fluoridated water, and don't use cell phones a lot, because it will give you a brain tumor.
[01:50:07.083 --> 01:50:07.603]  That's admitted.
[01:50:08.763 --> 01:50:10.724]  And don't drink out of cheap plastic.
[01:50:12.144 --> 01:50:14.745]  You can go research this if you want to learn the different symbols on plastic.
[01:50:16.625 --> 01:50:18.946]  You may not care about yourself, but at least care about your children.
[01:50:21.386 --> 01:50:22.087]  At least do that.
[01:50:22.727 --> 01:50:24.747]  And there are a lot of cities getting ready to take fluoride out.
[01:50:24.767 --> 01:50:25.688]  I've got another report here.
[01:50:25.748 --> 01:50:30.389]  Finally all the documents have come out, and city officials, when they're finally given the documents, can't believe it.
[01:50:30.902 --> 01:50:31.402]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:50:31.422 --> 01:50:32.623]  I had a question on the unfairness doctrine.
[01:50:57.276 --> 01:51:02.559]  Uh, and I wish you, uh, from now on would refer to it as the unfairness doctrine.
[01:51:02.579 --> 01:51:04.521]  I mean, how about the Soviet free speech ban?
[01:51:06.162 --> 01:51:06.862]  That sounds good.
[01:51:07.302 --> 01:51:07.722]  No.
[01:51:08.143 --> 01:51:10.944]  What, uh, what are you going to do when that comes down?
[01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:14.627]  Do you have any, really, uh, uh, plans?
[01:51:16.223 --> 01:51:27.248]  They're going to target AM and FM, but they're saying under fairness now, they're going to shut down internet radio.
[01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:32.030]  So they'll try to use examples that look good in the media.
[01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:35.572]  They'll try to set precedence, but these crooks aren't going to get away with it.
[01:51:40.279 --> 01:51:56.152]  With the so-called campaign finance reform that doubled the money corporations could give but restricted free speech, that I couldn't interview groups that were, say, pro-land grab, anti-land grab, or pro-gun group, or anti-gun group, that I couldn't have my own opinions.
[01:51:56.312 --> 01:51:57.393]  People just ignored that.
[01:51:58.333 --> 01:52:02.657]  So let these smiley-faced criminals tell us that we don't have free speech.
[01:52:02.717 --> 01:52:06.620]  We still have it, and I'm not going to go along with it, but it's not just there.
[01:52:08.166 --> 01:52:14.228]  They're coming out with a violent radicalization act where they openly want to ban 9-11, Truth, and a lot of other things.
[01:52:15.928 --> 01:52:21.470]  Well, but they're not going to be directly attacking you because you're too tough of a bird.
[01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:24.851]  No, they'll go out and set... They'll go out to stations.
[01:52:25.151 --> 01:52:26.071]  They'll go out to stations.
[01:52:27.071 --> 01:52:29.072]  Yeah, and then the stations will kick you off the air.
[01:52:29.572 --> 01:52:31.032]  That's their plan, is it not?
[01:52:31.212 --> 01:52:32.313]  That is their plan, sir.
[01:52:32.373 --> 01:52:33.293]  I appreciate your call.
[01:52:34.051 --> 01:52:35.432]  That is, land of the free and home of the brave.
[01:52:35.452 --> 01:52:36.553]  I mean, you can't have free speech.
[01:52:36.673 --> 01:52:38.334]  You can't protest on the street.
[01:52:38.354 --> 01:52:39.315]  You can't have a radio show.
[01:52:39.395 --> 01:52:42.057]  I mean, America's not about being able to say what you want.
[01:52:42.117 --> 01:52:44.920]  I mean, that's a conspiracy theory!
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:49.643]  Some people say that once you could say what you wanted in America, that was a lie.
[01:52:49.683 --> 01:52:51.345]  That was Al Qaeda saying that.
[01:52:52.406 --> 01:52:53.466]  No, no.
[01:52:54.087 --> 01:52:57.169]  Some people said that Obama wasn't born from a virgin birth.
[01:52:57.910 --> 01:53:00.772]  Some people said that he didn't have little wings under his jacket.
[01:53:01.433 --> 01:53:02.894]  They were Al Qaeda members.
[01:53:04.013 --> 01:53:05.534]  No, Obama is the Savior.
[01:53:06.254 --> 01:53:07.075]  He will save us.
[01:53:08.655 --> 01:53:10.216]  Andrew in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:53:11.297 --> 01:53:12.977]  Hello, this is Andrew.
[01:53:13.097 --> 01:53:15.899]  I just wanted to talk about Obama.
[01:53:17.620 --> 01:53:20.841]  You mean, please don't blaspheme, sir, Lord Obama.
[01:53:22.062 --> 01:53:24.363]  Lord, the One, the Savior.
[01:53:24.403 --> 01:53:24.783]  Go ahead.
[01:53:25.403 --> 01:53:26.224]  Talk of His grace.
[01:53:26.624 --> 01:53:27.665]  Yes, what of His grace?
[01:53:28.265 --> 01:53:29.165]  What of the Savior?
[01:53:29.185 --> 01:53:32.687]  I just wanted to say that.
[01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:37.022]  Will Obama be a better president than any other one?
[01:53:37.582 --> 01:53:39.323]  No, George Bush ran nothing.
[01:53:40.784 --> 01:53:42.045]  George Bush was a puppet.
[01:53:42.345 --> 01:53:43.126]  That's what we're saying.
[01:53:43.186 --> 01:53:44.206]  He doesn't matter.
[01:53:44.546 --> 01:53:49.389]  But his policies are for total corporate raping of the population.
[01:53:52.851 --> 01:53:57.974]  Do you think Obama will be protected or will he be assassinated?
[01:53:59.344 --> 01:54:09.687]  I think he'll be protected, but they're going to have horrible, degenerate, distasteful, ugly, racist groups attacking him, and that will fool a lot of folks into supporting him.
[01:54:10.187 --> 01:54:11.867]  So there's a lot of tricks they can play with Obama.
[01:54:13.428 --> 01:54:15.868]  Let's talk to Isaiah in California.
[01:54:15.928 --> 01:54:16.968]  You're on the air, Isaiah.
[01:54:17.609 --> 01:54:18.729]  Hey, how are you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:54:19.049 --> 01:54:19.969]  Isaiah, welcome.
[01:54:20.409 --> 01:54:24.570]  Yeah, I had a question, and I want to tell you why I'm asking the question.
[01:54:25.711 --> 01:54:26.831]  What is the Club of Rome?
[01:54:27.816 --> 01:54:41.240]  Club of Rome is a globalist think tank consortium calling for the extermination of 80% of the world's population and a neo-feudal planetary system run by a basic international corporate elite.
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:49.002]  Okay, well, the reason why I'm asking this question is because there's a man in Japan called Daisaku Ikeda.
[01:54:49.743 --> 01:54:54.664]  He is the president of Soka Gakkai International, a Buddhist association which claims 12 million members
[01:54:55.655 --> 01:55:05.420]  And in more than 190 countries and territories, and this man is an honorary member of Club of Rome, right?
[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:06.761]  No, no, that's who they recruit.
[01:55:06.801 --> 01:55:08.382]  They recruit influential people.
[01:55:08.742 --> 01:55:15.065]  No, but this... I researched about this Buddhist, and they've done a lot of good things around the world.
[01:55:15.726 --> 01:55:23.330]  But see, I don't know, because you always say it's compartmentalized, and also this Buddhist association called Sogagakkai,
[01:55:24.218 --> 01:55:31.245]  He has his own party in the Japanese government and it's called the New Komeito.
[01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:35.749]  It's the third biggest party in Japan.
[01:55:36.689 --> 01:55:37.590]  Are you Japanese?
[01:55:38.091 --> 01:55:39.112]  Yeah, I called him before.
[01:55:39.152 --> 01:55:42.215]  You were asking me how to say endgame in Japanese and all that stuff.
[01:55:42.435 --> 01:55:43.856]  Yeah, you speak really good Japanese.
[01:55:43.896 --> 01:55:45.097]  I figured you were going to speak Japanese.
[01:55:46.018 --> 01:55:46.999]  I can hardly speak English.
[01:55:47.039 --> 01:55:49.161]  I'm very fancy that you can speak both.
[01:55:49.853 --> 01:55:50.634]  Probably more than two.
[01:55:52.356 --> 01:55:53.116]  That's what they do.
[01:55:53.136 --> 01:56:05.008]  They have outer and inner rings of the CFR, Trilateral Commission Club of Rome, and they go and they get an Angelina Jolie to join the CFR so that that gives them the look of being mainstream.
[01:56:05.548 --> 01:56:09.592]  But she's never let in on the inner policy meetings that go on.
[01:56:09.672 --> 01:56:13.276]  So it's all part of influence peddling.
[01:56:16.095 --> 01:56:18.336]  Okay, well, what do you think about this man, Daisaku Ikeda?
[01:56:18.356 --> 01:56:19.816]  He's the president of Soka Gakkai.
[01:56:20.296 --> 01:56:22.317]  I mean, he has a lot of people on his side, you know.
[01:56:22.337 --> 01:56:25.677]  I mean, I've done... Yeah, that's who's part of these globalist groups are powerful people.
[01:56:25.857 --> 01:56:26.418]  So he's evil?
[01:56:27.098 --> 01:56:28.038]  No, I don't know who he is.
[01:56:28.078 --> 01:56:30.879]  I don't know that particular member of Club of Rome.
[01:56:30.919 --> 01:56:37.540]  And a lot of times when you're honorary, I've been made an honorary group of Christian groups and other groups and people make a big issue.
[01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:39.701]  Look, you're an honorary member of this.
[01:56:39.761 --> 01:56:44.382]  Well, I didn't even know I was an honorary member, you know, of some little subgroup of something.
[01:56:45.563 --> 01:56:48.305]  So, I don't have enough information on that to comment.
[01:56:48.785 --> 01:57:01.171]  I know the policies of the Club of Rome, they admit that there's no global cooling or heating that's unnatural, that carbon dioxide's a way to make humans the enemy of the state, to institutionalize war against the individual.
[01:57:01.992 --> 01:57:06.114]  And so, that's said in some of their documents we cover in films like Endgame.
[01:57:07.955 --> 01:57:08.615]  All right, man.
[01:57:08.655 --> 01:57:08.815]  Thanks.
[01:57:09.336 --> 01:57:09.816]  Hey, thank you.
[01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:10.536]  Good to hear from you.
[01:57:11.877 --> 01:57:12.497]  Let's go ahead.
[01:57:12.537 --> 01:57:13.998]  Well, my voice is really going out now.
[01:57:17.526 --> 01:57:19.547]  Soheed, you've got about 30 seconds, go ahead.
[01:57:20.848 --> 01:57:21.188]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:21.228 --> 01:57:21.788]  Hey, how are you doing?
[01:57:21.808 --> 01:57:22.569]  I'm in the telephone.
[01:57:22.609 --> 01:57:26.171]  Now, I just had a question, Alex.
[01:57:26.191 --> 01:57:29.012]  There's a game coming out with Tom Clancy called End War.
[01:57:29.352 --> 01:57:30.713]  Have you seen the commercial of that?
[01:57:31.033 --> 01:57:31.654]  Yeah, I have.
[01:57:31.694 --> 01:57:33.335]  It's all new roller stuff, getting you ready.
[01:57:34.195 --> 01:57:34.816]  Yeah, it is.
[01:57:34.876 --> 01:57:39.578]  It's going to be $800 dollar barrel oil prices in the Middle East for about $20 million.
[01:57:40.059 --> 01:57:42.920]  Now, compared to that, to the 2002 Ghost Recon,
[01:57:44.718 --> 01:57:45.619]  Which is where the U.S.
[01:57:45.699 --> 01:57:50.107]  attacks Georgia through Georgia into Russia even in the same month, yeah.
[01:57:50.888 --> 01:57:52.671]  So are they getting us ready for this?
[01:57:52.691 --> 01:57:58.401]  Should we start... Oh, they did Fox TV shows where the government hijacks a jet to fly it to the World Trade Center to blame it on Afghanistan.
[01:57:59.253 --> 01:58:03.117]  And they love to flaunt what they're gonna do beforehand, so you gotta look at that.
[01:58:03.938 --> 01:58:05.099]  Criminals love to brag.
[01:58:05.139 --> 01:58:05.739]  They always do.
[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:06.680]  Out of time.
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:07.381]  God bless you all.
[01:58:07.401 --> 01:58:08.762]  See you back next Sunday or back tomorrow.
[01:58:09.042 --> 01:58:10.244]  InfoWars.com.
[01:58:10.424 --> 01:58:11.485]  Appreciate you all.
[01:58:11.945 --> 01:58:13.246]  Get out there and take on tyranny.
[01:58:13.567 --> 01:58:14.688]  Knowing is half the battle.
[01:58:14.728 --> 01:58:15.989]  Taking action is the other half.
[01:58:16.329 --> 01:58:17.210]  Let's do it together.
[01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:18.531]  Death to the New World Order.
[01:58:18.892 --> 01:58:19.873]  Forever for liberty.
[01:58:20.672 --> 01:58:21.692]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:58:56.902 --> 01:59:00.083]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.

[01:59:22.413 --> 01:59:24.194]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[01:59:24.635 --> 01:59:26.076]  I can't find my wallet!
[01:59:26.396 --> 01:59:27.096]  Sound familiar?
[01:59:27.256 --> 01:59:30.539]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead?
