[00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:06.458]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:08.200]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:10.023]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:11.484]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:13.167]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:17.432]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:22.058]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:38.568]  Kent Snyder, the head of the Ron Paul 2008 presidential campaign, will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.332]  Give or take a few when they're on the campaign trail.
[00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:44.593]  They're in Iowa right now.
[00:00:44.653 --> 00:00:48.796]  Sometimes it fluctuates a bit as they're out there on the battlefield.
[00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:49.817]  That is coming up.
[00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:55.921]  Congressman Ron Paul, scheduled to join us on primary day, opening primary day in Iowa.
[00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:02.452]  And that is tomorrow, right in the middle of the transmission at 12.30 Central, 1.30 Eastern.
[00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:20.847]  We also have Mike Adams coming on, who's been doing a, he's an investigative journalist, also health expert, coming on to talk about what's happening with the great HPV, human papilloma live cancer virus vaccinations.
[00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:21.708]  Big developments there.
[00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.729]  We're now a year
[00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:31.815]  And a few days into it being approved for human use, experimentally, but still, experimental vaccine, and the governor said you must take it.
[00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:36.216]  Of course, there was no law you had to, just compounding the incredible fraud.
[00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:40.917]  Also, Rand Paul, Dr. Rand Paul, son of Ron Paul, will be joining us on Friday.
[00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:49.979]  Continual Ron Paul coverage right through New Hampshire, Michigan, Wyoming, Montana, right through all the states, Nevada.
[00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.901]  We will be covering it here as it unfolds.
[00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:58.563]  Obviously, big news.
[00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:00.745]  It's been big news since last Friday.
[00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:16.174]  The fact that Fox News is going to censor Ron Paul and they're going to have several candidates there that are tied or lower than Ron Paul in several of the polls.
[00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:17.237]  I don't
[00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:59.339]  The eve of the new year and when those checks were open and postdated, and that's how they're filed into the Federal Elections Commission, a few hundred thousand above, twenty million dollars raised in the fourth quarter of 2007.
[00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.561]  And since Sunday, we have had a list of
[00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:19.648]  Fox News Sponsors posted up on PrisonPlanet.com and FoxSponsorBoycott.com.
[00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:20.628]  We have a link to that.
[00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:24.050]  Also, I know Kurt Nimmo can do another report on this today.
[00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:37.297]  Boycott Fox News Sponsors, and we have a list of those and their phone numbers, and I suggest that you go after them because that really is the only thing that will affect Fox.
[00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:54.963]  Has its bread buttered by government that allows it to run oligopolies, effective monopolies, in many areas of the world, including China, not just Australia, England, the United States, Europe, Russia, Latin America, but all across Asia.
[00:03:55.644 --> 00:04:07.252]  Murdoch is now the second largest media conglomerate inside China and fully complies with censorship and reporting on people and with their internet systems, very tyrannical individuals.
[00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:12.200]  And you better believe they're going along with the setup of tyranny here as well.
[00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:16.244]  But they knew they would be boycotted.
[00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:19.368]  That's why they allowed Ron Paul in the other debates.
[00:04:19.428 --> 00:04:26.195]  But now, on the eve of the most highly anticipated final debate, ABC is now saying they're probably not going to have Paul.
[00:04:26.956 --> 00:04:29.158]  They cannot allow him because of his trajectory.
[00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:35.679]  He went from 2 points in New Hampshire to 5 points, to 8 points, to 10 points, to 12 points in many polls now.
[00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:46.586]  And that's polling traditional Republicans and Democrats who are establishment, not the 35 to 40 percent, and I actually have the numbers here depending on the state, who's called themselves independent.
[00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:50.409]  That is the majority of those different minority groups broken down.
[00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:52.210]  That is the largest percentile.
[00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:54.992]  And so you're going to see some surprises in New Hampshire.
[00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:57.034]  Big pollsters are saying he could win.
[00:04:57.054 --> 00:04:59.015]  They're doing everything they can to dampen it.
[00:05:02.017 --> 00:05:03.417]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:05.538]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.258 --> 00:05:10.659]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.920]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.220]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.201]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:27.283]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.253]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.754 --> 00:05:39.196]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.596 --> 00:05:42.118]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:43.319]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:44.079]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.240]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.021]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:47.241]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:07.160]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.304 --> 00:08:21.986]  It is already the second day of January 2008.
[00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:26.049]  That is going to take some getting used to.
[00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:28.550]  I was still getting used to 2007, to saying it.
[00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.252]  And the year was already over.
[00:08:30.272 --> 00:08:32.433]  Ah, yes.
[00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:33.554]  2007, the year of completion.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.465]  2008 is a year of new beginnings and great change.
[00:08:47.586 --> 00:08:54.814]  So the numerologists say, not that I put much stock in that, but the establishment certainly does.
[00:08:55.015 --> 00:09:03.204]  And that's what their gurus are saying, and look for the New World Order to move in a big way against free humanity.
[00:09:03.965 --> 00:09:18.449]  Look for the kings of the earth to move in a big way against free humanity, and look for the free peoples of the planet to stand firmly and intensify our counterattack against the forces of the New World Order.
[00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:25.056]  We are, of course, going to be here live for the next two hours and 50 minutes.
[00:09:25.577 --> 00:09:30.920]  Kent Snyder is coming up later in the hour, the head of the Ron Paul 2008 campaign.
[00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.463]  Rand Paul, Ron Paul's son, Dr. Rand Paul on Friday.
[00:09:35.323 --> 00:09:44.370]  And, of course, we've got Congressman Ron Paul himself joining us as the Iowa primary, the first in
[00:09:45.370 --> 00:10:08.261]  Election 2008 kicks off, and whereas the big pony race is very interesting and akin to a sporting event, and in the past, the last few elections, presidential level, have been just that, dog and pony shows, this race is more exciting
[00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:38.094]  A thousand fold because in this race you have the other 15 horses or so owned by Don Carleone and there is actually one horse in the race not owned by Don Carleone and Don Carleone's got his other horses all souped up on the juice and on speed and they're busy trying to throw tacks out on the ground as Ron Paul walks towards the gate
[00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:47.387]  Getting ready for the starting gun, hoping that he will step on one of the tacks and go lame on them.
[00:10:48.327 --> 00:10:54.150]  They've thrown every bit of detritus they can at the wall, hoping that some of it sticks.
[00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.691]  Very little of it has stuck.
[00:10:56.731 --> 00:11:03.054]  In fact, I think for every person that the Nazi skinhead reports did affect,
[00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:21.449]  Or for every person that the earmark stories did reach and did affect, those that were informed and intelligent, it actually woke them up to how good Ron Paul is, and the fact that the establishment is attacking him with both barrels.
[00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:31.294]  A lot of people are saying that this will backfire on the establishment, that
[00:11:32.606 --> 00:11:36.269]  Ron Paul has been banned from the Fox News debate.
[00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:52.702]  And that's certainly true at a certain level, but I've always talked about different brands of propaganda, different stratas, different layers to the onion in the different varieties of the buffet of lies, the all-you-can-eat buffet of propaganda that the media lays out.
[00:11:52.742 --> 00:11:57.806]  They got the CNN, the MSNBC, the Fox News kind of cartoon brand.
[00:11:58.928 --> 00:12:00.789]  They've got the Wall Street Journal brands.
[00:12:00.809 --> 00:12:02.509]  They've got the New York Times brands.
[00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.050]  They've got the NPR brand.
[00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.571]  They've got the Democracy Now!
[00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:06.091]  brand.
[00:12:07.051 --> 00:12:13.314]  They've got even the false brands of, quote, conspiracy and different types of truth or news.
[00:12:15.175 --> 00:12:19.556]  And most people who go along with that propaganda don't even know it.
[00:12:19.576 --> 00:12:20.477]  They kind of repeat it.
[00:12:21.317 --> 00:12:22.198]  They're called repeaters.
[00:12:22.838 --> 00:12:28.080]  They kind of parrot it, mockingbird it, unknowingly, the old snowball effect.
[00:12:28.817 --> 00:12:39.485]  A small ball was the actual original government disinfo and then it picks up steam and they understand the power of viral information.
[00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:43.728]  They know how to tailor it for the gossips and the idiots to spread it.
[00:12:44.088 --> 00:12:48.111]  And it's up to us to educate people how they do that.
[00:12:51.113 --> 00:12:56.157]  But for every person that has been affected by their propaganda,
[00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:04.070]  More and more people are coming of age and realizing how propaganda, at least basic propaganda, works, and so it's having kind of the opposite effect.
[00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:09.673]  Instead of putting them to sleep, it is enraging them, irritating them, inflaming them.
[00:13:11.854 --> 00:13:17.016]  But I was driving along listening to 90.1 FM this morning, stationed here locally in Austin, a microbe,
[00:13:18.075 --> 00:13:34.748]  I was listening to Catherine Albrecht and she was talking about how she just now noticed, she's a really nice lady, I don't know how many times, just now noticed that Ron Paul isn't in the New York Times, Ron Paul isn't in the Washington Post, he isn't in the LA Times, he isn't in the Detroit Free Press, he isn't in the Miami Herald, he's in their blogs!
[00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.011]  And I've pointed that out many times.
[00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:39.973]  That's just one little example.
[00:13:40.393 --> 00:13:46.538]  See, Paulites as they call us, or Paultards as they call us, unaffectionately,
[00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:52.746]  Are thinking that, oh, he's getting a lot of attention.
[00:13:53.266 --> 00:14:02.315]  But it's very, very, very selective, and it's in a strata that we already have air superiority in, so the enemy has just capitulated.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.880]  That's the same thing.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:20.367]  They have fake liberal brands, fake conservative brands, or in spectrums that we've already dominated, they have no choice but to come in and report on what we're doing, but then put every form of semantical dalliance on top of it.
[00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.411]  And there's just so many different layers to that.
[00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:37.154]  But becoming aware of the fact that you are under propaganda bombardment, becoming aware of the different types of propaganda, that is the beginning of winning the battle.
[00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:41.937]  Knowing who the enemy is, understanding they're trying to lie and manipulate you.
[00:14:41.957 --> 00:14:45.398]  And there's so many layers to that.
[00:14:45.538 --> 00:14:57.385]  One big layer is that once you get into alternative media, you're like a newly awakened person who's learned how to walk, learned how to talk, learned how to see.
[00:14:58.599 --> 00:15:01.500]  So you don't know exactly what the shapes you're looking at are.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.522]  You know that old world was a lie, but you tend to accept this new world as if it's true.
[00:15:07.602 --> 00:15:09.042]  No, it's really the same old world.
[00:15:09.063 --> 00:15:11.303]  It's just another layer to the onion.
[00:15:11.823 --> 00:15:13.944]  And so you have to learn to differentiate that.
[00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:19.266]  And again, that's all part of a process.
[00:15:19.366 --> 00:15:20.686]  It's a learning process.
[00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:23.007]  None of us will ever achieve perfection in this.
[00:15:23.567 --> 00:15:25.588]  But we can always try to get better.
[00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:50.292]  And it's real simple, they would have people after the JFK assassination, similar to the Budo situation, in many respects, they would have somebody come out and put out credible info and put out a lot of things that made sense, and then they would suddenly show up at a TV interview and say that they were the Pope's reincarnated, or Jesus reincarnated, or the Easter Bunny reincarnated, literally.
[00:15:51.152 --> 00:15:53.034]  They would say that, you know, that they
[00:15:54.272 --> 00:16:00.515]  Fingerprinted their daughter every night to, this is a true story, to make sure that it was really hers in the morning.
[00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:07.959]  And then, you know, or they'd run around naked in the street and flopping around and be committed for a month.
[00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:09.520]  All in staged events.
[00:16:10.621 --> 00:16:11.761]  And the media would report on that.
[00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:17.084]  And so now we have people on 9-11 Truths saying space beams fired from Octuras did it.
[00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:40.776]  Or saying that holograms did it and I mean you'll literally be at events when these people are there and they'll just walk up and just go we're gonna get you soon and they just laugh and look at you with hate you'll see them with cops and feds that are there playing another you know side of the paradigm and you find I mean it's just I mean they're literally feds they'll just come right up to you and basically say it
[00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:51.842]  And you'll get taken by them, because you'll have them on, you'll interview them for a year, they'll operate with total credibility, and then just flip in a minute.
[00:16:54.144 --> 00:16:55.724]  That's why it's important to meet people in person.
[00:16:55.764 --> 00:17:04.649]  A few of these people I met in person before they flipped, and they would walk up with that predatory look in their eye, they have a fake smile, but you could see their distaste and their fear of me.
[00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.891]  These people are afraid of the real McCoy.
[00:17:09.371 --> 00:17:10.912]  And they do it in so many other areas.
[00:17:10.952 --> 00:17:12.793]  Chupacabras, Reptoids,
[00:17:16.992 --> 00:17:27.055]  Or, and then they've got other more effective brands of it, trying to get you to attach, Jews did it to the whole New World Order situation, whether that's true or not.
[00:17:27.776 --> 00:17:28.996]  I'm not even debating that.
[00:17:30.156 --> 00:17:44.661]  The point is, is that's still incredibly unpalatable with 90 plus percent of the public, and they're going to be able to tie you in with two toothless, shaved head ne'er-do-wells, and then you're instantly going to lose the ball game right there.
[00:17:48.942 --> 00:17:49.322]  You see?
[00:17:51.124 --> 00:17:56.509]  Or if they can get you to fall into all of the weird sectarian things that are going on.
[00:17:56.569 --> 00:18:02.555]  I mean, you've got a thousand times a thousand different brands of Protestants all over each other's throats.
[00:18:03.396 --> 00:18:06.338]  Every church next to every other church saying that church is evil.
[00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:07.720]  They've got it all wrong.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.065]  All worried like a bunch of Pharisees on the hill about, you know, who follows the law better or who can
[00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:20.645]  You know, do double back somersault flips through flaming hoops with their hair on fire instead of, who loves God?
[00:18:20.685 --> 00:18:21.865]  Who stands up against evil?
[00:18:22.065 --> 00:18:23.166]  Who wants to do right?
[00:18:27.187 --> 00:18:28.067]  You see, that's man.
[00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:32.868]  They want to make a big complex system for you so they can patent it and sell it to you.
[00:18:35.229 --> 00:18:40.310]  You've got a thousand different brands of Catholics all frothing at each other's throats.
[00:18:42.551 --> 00:18:42.991]  You've got a
[00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:54.691]  Fifty different brands of Mormons all at each other's throats, and you've got probably a thousand different brands of Seventh-Day Adventists all frothing at each other's throats.
[00:18:54.991 --> 00:19:04.041]  Meanwhile, never out-warning people about vaccines filled with cancer viruses and mercury, never out-warning people about property rights being taken, never focusing on issues.
[00:19:05.342 --> 00:19:08.045]  A controlled system will never focus on issues.
[00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.692]  A controlled system will always try to get you to end fight with each other.
[00:19:13.013 --> 00:19:19.377]  A controlled system will tell you there is no hope, you'll never beat it, just give in to it, and just trust God to fix it.
[00:19:19.977 --> 00:19:23.060]  Yeah, trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.621]  The old Bedouin saying.
[00:19:25.401 --> 00:19:27.583]  Or trust in God, but row away from the rocks.
[00:19:28.043 --> 00:19:34.327]  Ask God to give me guidance to be able to pull hard enough and in a focused enough way to get away from these rocks.
[00:19:35.948 --> 00:19:38.390]  God give me the strength to stand up against evil.
[00:19:39.412 --> 00:19:45.296]  Help me have a strong spine and a strong gut and help my fist be strong.
[00:19:47.618 --> 00:19:49.139]  Help my mind be keen.
[00:19:51.621 --> 00:19:54.443]  You see, judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:19:55.784 --> 00:19:56.925]  We'll be back with more news.
[00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:57.405]  Stay with me.

[00:20:35.122 --> 00:20:37.525]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:20:37.785 --> 00:20:41.388]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:20:41.588 --> 00:20:47.552]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[00:21:07.497 --> 00:21:11.659]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:12.899]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:17.801]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:20.422]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:14.045]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:21.674]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.398 --> 00:22:27.880]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:02.135 --> 00:23:09.616]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:23:09.737 --> 00:23:18.598]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:23:18.878 --> 00:23:29.400]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.

[00:24:27.473 --> 00:24:33.938]  I think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before.
[00:24:40.102 --> 00:24:47.068]  But you'd probably soon be wondering, the way that I was too, when you died in sixteen hours.
[00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:57.702]  We're good to go.
[00:25:29.352 --> 00:25:30.973]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:13.208]  So we are making a stand and we're waking everybody up that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:26:13.608 --> 00:26:16.210]  And you are the minority.
[00:26:29.008 --> 00:26:31.009]  You are the cowards who don't know the truth.
[00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.251]  You're the people that serve this evil system.
[00:26:33.631 --> 00:26:37.194]  You're the people that serve a system that hurts innocent men, women, and children.
[00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:43.398]  Not just Iraqis, not just Afghans, not just Africans, but the people right here in this nation.
[00:26:44.199 --> 00:26:49.282]  You serve a new world order that attacks and feeds on you.
[00:26:50.543 --> 00:26:53.625]  And I'm here to tell you that you will be defeated!
[00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:55.686]  Your hours are numbered!
[00:26:58.797 --> 00:27:01.278]  You're a million miles away.
[00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:04.740]  Every ounce of energy!
[00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:11.243]  As the sweat pours out your body!
[00:27:18.326 --> 00:27:19.526]  We've got the energy.
[00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:20.767]  We've got the life force.
[00:27:22.936 --> 00:27:25.399]  All you've got is evil backing you up.
[00:27:25.739 --> 00:27:27.020]  All you've got is greed.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.722]  Am I going to look at yourself in the mirror?
[00:27:29.102 --> 00:27:33.607]  Because deep down the New World Order is a pot-bellied, chicken-necked ninny.
[00:27:34.187 --> 00:27:37.611]  And all the armor and all the weapons are nothing!
[00:27:39.773 --> 00:27:41.715]  You are nothing compared to good.
[00:27:41.775 --> 00:27:43.437]  You are nothing compared to life.
[00:27:43.897 --> 00:27:45.399]  And you will be defeated!
[00:27:52.762 --> 00:27:57.307]  I want the individuals out there, I want free humanity to turn themselves loose!
[00:27:57.387 --> 00:27:58.929]  To cut the chains loose!
[00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:05.516]  And to use the end of that chain to slap the New World Order right upside the head!
[00:28:05.816 --> 00:28:06.977]  You've got the power!
[00:28:07.358 --> 00:28:09.320]  You want to know who can defeat the New World Order?
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.481]  It is you!
[00:28:11.442 --> 00:28:14.185]  You're the individuals that are going to be able to defeat this system!
[00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:17.823]  You're the individuals that are going to be able to take down the New World Order.
[00:28:17.983 --> 00:28:19.785]  It doesn't matter if Ron Paul wins.
[00:28:20.265 --> 00:28:22.347]  It doesn't matter if they rig the election.
[00:28:22.667 --> 00:28:24.849]  What matters is that we're starting to stand up.
[00:28:24.889 --> 00:28:25.849]  We're starting to move.
[00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.611]  We're starting to find our legs.
[00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.252]  We're starting to build our muscles.
[00:28:29.452 --> 00:28:31.534]  We're starting to realize that we do have power.
[00:28:31.694 --> 00:28:32.955]  And we can work together.
[00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:34.436]  And we can take action.
[00:28:34.596 --> 00:28:40.841]  And that the naysayers are a pack of weak liars who have never had any successes in their life!
[00:28:41.401 --> 00:28:47.583]  And who are upset and frustrated to see us beginning to have victory against tyranny!
[00:28:48.263 --> 00:28:53.745]  They don't have any respect for themselves, they don't have any vision, and they don't have any will.
[00:28:54.805 --> 00:29:04.328]  And they sure don't have any of the power that shines out of God's soul and energizes all life in the universe.
[00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:19.193]  They have wed themselves to death, and they will crumble, and they will fall, and for eternity, we wed ourselves to life, and to everything good, and everything that flows from it!
[00:29:22.808 --> 00:29:27.389]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, didn't mean to get up on my preacher's horse, but I did.
[00:29:27.449 --> 00:29:31.890]  We're scheduled to have Ken Schneider, the head of the Ron Paul campaign, straight ahead.
[00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:46.334]  On the other side, we will continue to track the assassination news out of Pakistan, the Iraq War, the Iran situation, the economy, what the New World Order is up to, and your phone calls.
[00:29:46.554 --> 00:29:49.575]  Big broadcast lined up today, January 2nd, 07.

[00:32:01.676 --> 00:32:03.517]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:03.677 --> 00:32:08.840]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.381]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:32:10.621 --> 00:32:18.806]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:32:28.954 --> 00:32:33.340]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.642]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:32:35.722 --> 00:32:42.531]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio vessel healthy.
[00:32:45.063 --> 00:32:47.205]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[00:32:47.385 --> 00:32:48.866]  Everybody knows things are bad.
[00:32:49.026 --> 00:32:50.067]  It's a depression.
[00:32:50.247 --> 00:32:53.089]  Everybody's out of work, or scared of losing their job.
[00:33:12.492 --> 00:33:14.014]  The dollar buys a nickel's worth.
[00:33:14.495 --> 00:33:15.516]  Banks are going bust.
[00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:17.519]  Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:19.742]  Punks are running wild in the street.
[00:33:19.782 --> 00:33:22.346]  There's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
[00:33:23.988 --> 00:33:24.369]  We know.
[00:33:24.829 --> 00:33:26.372]  The air is unfit to breathe.
[00:33:26.512 --> 00:33:27.894]  Our food is unfit to eat.
[00:33:28.723 --> 00:33:37.210]  We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes as if that's the way it's supposed to be!
[00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.572]  We know things are bad, worse than bad!
[00:33:40.152 --> 00:33:40.893]  They're crazy!
[00:33:41.113 --> 00:33:44.115]  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore!
[00:33:44.496 --> 00:33:51.421]  We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and all we say is, please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms!
[00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:55.805]  Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radios and I won't say anything!
[00:33:56.025 --> 00:33:56.846]  Just leave us alone!
[00:33:57.086 --> 00:33:58.407]  Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone!
[00:33:59.308 --> 00:34:00.449]  I want you to get mad!
[00:34:00.469 --> 00:34:02.571]  I don't want you to protest.
[00:34:02.691 --> 00:34:03.712]  I don't want you to riot.
[00:34:03.733 --> 00:34:06.676]  I don't want you to write to your congressmen because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write.
[00:34:07.056 --> 00:34:11.361]  I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
[00:34:11.701 --> 00:34:14.204]  All I know is that first, you've got to get mad!
[00:34:14.664 --> 00:34:16.566]  You've got to say, I'm a human being!
[00:34:16.786 --> 00:34:17.988]  My life has value!
[00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:20.030]  I want you...
[00:34:21.002 --> 00:34:23.083]  I want you to get up now.
[00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:25.103]  I want all of you to get up out of your chairs.
[00:34:25.123 --> 00:34:36.827]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:34:38.047 --> 00:34:39.427]  I want you to get up right now.
[00:34:40.188 --> 00:34:44.549]  Get up, go to your windows, open them and stick your head out and yell,
[00:34:47.053 --> 00:34:50.557]  I'm as tired as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!
[00:34:50.857 --> 00:34:58.966]  Ladies and gentlemen, we go directly to Des Moines, Iowa, where one of our top generals is on the front line.
[00:35:00.111 --> 00:35:06.173]  He's facing a rigged, stacked deck of corrupt, corporate, New World Order whore media.
[00:35:06.753 --> 00:35:11.235]  But he's there with a valiant and growing crew of individual freedom fighters.
[00:35:11.255 --> 00:35:12.175]  He's Kent Snyder.
[00:35:12.195 --> 00:35:18.037]  He's the head, the manager of the glorious Ron Paul 2008 campaign.
[00:35:18.057 --> 00:35:27.019]  He is right there with our champion in Des Moines, Iowa, here to talk about the Fox News and ABC censorship that they're discussing coming up in the final debates and forums.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.140]  He's here to discuss
[00:35:29.404 --> 00:35:30.125]  A strategy.
[00:35:30.165 --> 00:35:37.455]  He's here to discuss how we poll watch and how we finally have a big surge here as we go into the Republican primaries in election 2008.
[00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:39.938]  Ken Schneider, thank you for coming on, sir.
[00:35:40.559 --> 00:35:41.260]  Thanks for having me.
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:41.721]  Good morning.
[00:35:42.342 --> 00:35:43.964]  Ken, you've got the floor.
[00:35:43.984 --> 00:35:45.506]  I mean, I mentioned a few things I want to talk about.
[00:35:45.546 --> 00:35:46.888]  What do you think is most important right now?
[00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:50.175]  Well, the most important thing is the Iowa caucus tomorrow.
[00:35:50.695 --> 00:35:57.416]  We encourage everyone to call anyone that they know in Iowa and make sure that they get out and vote to attend their caucus.
[00:35:58.057 --> 00:36:09.119]  The quickest way to getting information about it is to go to our website, RonPaul2008.com, and they'll see at the very top information in terms of caucus to do it.
[00:36:09.519 --> 00:36:15.241]  I will tell you and your listeners that we are getting some very encouraging news from people on the ground here in Iowa.
[00:36:16.601 --> 00:36:18.283]  The support for Dr. Paul is growing.
[00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:21.445]  I think people, not think, we know that people are coming together.
[00:36:21.465 --> 00:36:24.467]  So Iowa is the show day tomorrow.
[00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:36.209]  And of course, New Hampshire following back on the 8th, and of course, we've got the so-called forum that Dr. Paul's been excluded from so far coming up, but Dr. Paul is here in Des Moines.
[00:36:36.569 --> 00:36:53.061]  He will be speaking to a rally of veterans tonight in Des Moines, which we're very excited about, and we have been told that C-SPAN will be covering that rally, so your listeners will want to watch live this evening, but there is a very big... And they'll want to tell the entire Internet!
[00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:54.422]  What time is that today, Kent?
[00:36:55.266 --> 00:37:08.904]  Uh, that's going to be, let me take a look here, that's going to be at, uh, because I got my schedule updated, it will be tonight at 7pm, it's called the Stronger America Rally with Veterans for Paul.
[00:37:09.225 --> 00:37:10.887]  Oh great, is that 7 o'clock Eastern?
[00:37:11.539 --> 00:37:12.580]  Seven o'clock central.
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.041]  Seven o'clock central?
[00:37:14.301 --> 00:37:28.951]  Tell everybody, anybody who's undecided, anybody that thinks Bush is this great hawk and wonderful, anybody who's still under the hoax that Ron Paul isn't the military candidate, he has the majority of military support, doesn't he?
[00:37:28.971 --> 00:37:30.332]  Yes, he does.
[00:37:30.412 --> 00:37:30.832]  He does.
[00:37:31.133 --> 00:37:40.039]  And, in fact, John Holland, who is part of the, or one of the founders, I believe, of the Rolling Thunder group, will be speaking on behalf of Ron.
[00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:49.433]  And then also, Ron will be on the Larry King live interview tonight at 6 Central Time for about a half hour or so.
[00:37:49.793 --> 00:37:53.875]  Just before the rally with veterans, he will be on Larry King as well.
[00:37:53.975 --> 00:37:55.796]  So people will want to tune in to that.
[00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:57.597]  We have a full day today.
[00:37:57.617 --> 00:37:59.558]  We've got a full day tomorrow.
[00:38:00.558 --> 00:38:02.459]  Dr. Paul is hustling as he always does.
[00:38:03.007 --> 00:38:09.953]  Well, he is hustling, and I hear him on so many other talk shows, just on radio, not to mention national TV and regional television.
[00:38:09.973 --> 00:38:13.376]  He'll be on with us for 30 minutes tomorrow at 1230 Central.
[00:38:13.396 --> 00:38:14.517]  I mean, he is 72 years old.
[00:38:27.908 --> 00:38:33.269]  I mean, I've done thousands of interviews before in a year, and it's exhausting, and that's a fraction of what he's done.
[00:38:33.529 --> 00:38:34.749]  How does he keep it up, Kent?
[00:38:35.649 --> 00:38:38.310]  Well, you know, he's committed.
[00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:48.432]  He's committed, I think, like a lot of us around the country in terms of the cause and trying to bring freedom back and to make America America again.
[00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:52.352]  I mean, that's what he's been doing for the last 25 years as a member of Congress.
[00:38:52.432 --> 00:38:55.033]  Imagine how hard he would work in the Oval Office.
[00:38:56.807 --> 00:39:00.069]  Well, I tell you what, I do imagine that about every morning when I get up.
[00:39:00.149 --> 00:39:05.513]  But he's definitely committed to the cause, the freedom movement in general, as we all are.
[00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:11.497]  And he's doing it, obviously, in a very big way and a unique way that most of us don't have the opportunity to do.
[00:39:12.218 --> 00:39:16.541]  But, you know, like you say, he's 72, but he acts sometimes like he's 42.
[00:39:16.681 --> 00:39:21.304]  And I mean, I'm just a few years, I mean, I'm 48 and I have trouble keeping up with him myself.
[00:39:21.484 --> 00:39:23.465]  So he's out there all the time.
[00:39:23.506 --> 00:39:24.066]  He's a trooper.
[00:39:25.066 --> 00:39:25.707]  Absolutely.
[00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:28.230]  Fox News situation.
[00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:31.495]  Friday you talked about how disgusting it was that they were going to censor him.
[00:39:31.855 --> 00:39:42.129]  They've got candidates that are lower or tied with him in polls that are going to be there at the Fox debate just a couple days before that key New Hampshire
[00:39:42.979 --> 00:39:44.501]  Uh, primary early next week.
[00:39:45.122 --> 00:39:50.968]  And, uh, then folks on the web put out that it wasn't true, and then we confirmed that it was the case.
[00:39:51.549 --> 00:39:53.030]  AP, Reuters, everybody did say.
[00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.833]  Fox now admits they are censoring the congressman.
[00:39:55.913 --> 00:39:57.155]  Uh, your take on that, Kent Snyder?
[00:39:57.799 --> 00:40:00.841]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's unfortunate, and that's being kind.
[00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:07.546]  I mean, we definitely think that Dr. Paul should be included because of, one, his historic fundraising.
[00:40:08.187 --> 00:40:10.889]  He's polling at 11-12% in South Carolina.
[00:40:11.789 --> 00:40:16.433]  By all other metrics, I mean, the interest in Dr. Paul's campaign is growing by the day.
[00:40:16.993 --> 00:40:18.875]  Their excuse is quite lame.
[00:40:19.135 --> 00:40:20.236]  They say they don't have enough room.
[00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:26.034]  I mean, I can't imagine Fox News not having enough room in a studio for another participant.
[00:40:26.054 --> 00:40:29.216]  So that's just lame and it goes to show exactly what they are doing.
[00:40:29.236 --> 00:40:32.479]  They don't have any more legitimate rationale or excuse than that.
[00:40:32.918 --> 00:40:42.241]  But we think that if things go well here tomorrow, that Fox News will really have no choice but to change their mind and include Dr. Paul.
[00:40:42.601 --> 00:40:46.222]  But if they don't, I mean, we're planning on some sort of response to that.
[00:40:46.342 --> 00:40:54.385]  But we encourage people to contact their local Fox affiliate and Fox News in New York and tell them that they're just not happy with it at all.
[00:40:55.504 --> 00:40:59.145]  Well, I mean, obviously, Ron Paul has raised more money than any other Republican.
[00:40:59.645 --> 00:41:04.366]  He is tied with Hillary, the biggest fundraiser on the Democratic side in the last quarter.
[00:41:05.126 --> 00:41:14.389]  He's broken all campaign records with a six-plus-million-dollar haul on the Boston Tea Party date.
[00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:21.611]  And, I mean, he is exponentially rising in even the rigged polls, where they're going after
[00:41:23.766 --> 00:41:28.807]  I agree, and I think from what I've been getting the buzz around is that I think they are thinking that as well.
[00:41:28.847 --> 00:41:31.028]  What angers me obviously first is that Dr. Paul has been excluded.
[00:41:49.626 --> 00:42:00.675]  But more than that, I think what Fox News and the executives at Fox News are saying is that not only is it a slap in the face to Dr. Paul, but it's a slap in the face to all of us.
[00:42:00.916 --> 00:42:05.680]  All of us who believe in what Dr. Paul is doing, who believe in the Freedom Movement, and all that.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.241]  I mean, I take it as an insult.
[00:42:07.261 --> 00:42:14.527]  So I think the way I take it is that the executives in New York's Fox News are saying that the people in the Freedom Movement don't count.
[00:42:15.123 --> 00:42:21.167]  We're trying to squelch you, that sort of thing, and so to me it's a bigger slap than just that Dr. Paul himself.
[00:42:21.947 --> 00:42:26.390]  Mr. Schneider, I want to get your expertise, your inside the campaign take on this.
[00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:38.257]  Before, they knew that if they excluded Paul from debates, that it would cause the boycott, and they thought they could minimize him, have the pundits demonize him, ignore him, give him less time than anybody else.
[00:42:39.938 --> 00:42:43.901]  Every time he won a poll saying that his people cheated with no evidence,
[00:42:45.034 --> 00:42:57.364]  Uh, that didn't work, so now this, here's a sign to me that we've heard them bad, now they're scared, and they're trying to cover their soft underbelly, and they see him using these final debates as a springboard.
[00:42:58.385 --> 00:42:58.605]  Yeah.
[00:42:59.185 --> 00:43:00.186]  Yeah, yeah, there's no doubt.
[00:43:00.226 --> 00:43:02.328]  I mean, Dr. Paul makes sense, as you know.
[00:43:02.368 --> 00:43:08.873]  He's given limited time, but at the limited time he's given, he makes sense, he says things that need to be said, people are responding.
[00:43:09.213 --> 00:43:12.636]  I mean, the people in, that run these networks are not complete idiots.
[00:43:13.075 --> 00:43:17.349]  I mean they realize what's going on and of course that started back with the Reagan debate.
[00:43:18.139 --> 00:43:21.781]  You know, months ago, and of course the South Carolina debate, and every debate since then.
[00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:23.822]  So, they don't like what he's saying.
[00:43:24.143 --> 00:43:25.243]  I agree with Dr. Paul.
[00:43:25.283 --> 00:43:35.749]  They don't like what he's saying, and they want to, you know, I guess they wish that he would just go away, and they wish that people like us and your listeners would go away as well, and of course we're not.
[00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:44.354]  I mean, that to me is really the point, is that these people will realize sooner or later, and it might be later, that we are not going away.
[00:43:45.934 --> 00:44:04.725]  Well, again, I've conducted polls with Zogby, just to be fair, and actually, I wanted to know, so I did what you would call an internal poll, publicly, of just voters across the spectrum, and Ron Paul won in more than twenty demographics, lost in one, but came in second against Giuliani.
[00:44:05.325 --> 00:44:07.747]  You probably saw that poll, it got quite a bit of press attention.
[00:44:08.307 --> 00:44:14.691]  And then I've looked at the other internal polls that have been leaked, and they don't even mention Ron Paul, or they list five candidates and then say, or other.
[00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:16.651]  They're doing everything they can.
[00:44:16.992 --> 00:44:25.634]  I mean, I know that you guys like to take the high road, but are you going to put out any statements here in the close, as we go into the primaries, about how they've been rigging the polls?
[00:44:25.654 --> 00:44:26.855]  Because there's no doubt they've been rigging them.
[00:44:27.535 --> 00:44:28.995]  Yeah, there's no doubt about that.
[00:44:29.035 --> 00:44:30.336]  But I mean, this is what I know.
[00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:34.577]  What I know is, as you've already mentioned, the metric that's very important is money.
[00:44:34.737 --> 00:44:41.059]  Remember, Alex, you know, months ago, the refrain from the press was, well, Dr. Paul can't raise any money.
[00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:44.700]  And it was spybots we're doing and imaginary computer creatures.
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:45.821]  Right, right.
[00:44:45.861 --> 00:44:49.764]  So that question was answered soundly.
[00:44:50.084 --> 00:44:54.508]  So that's a very important metric to use, the ability to raise money.
[00:44:55.069 --> 00:45:04.857]  I've had producers of television shows, national television shows, tell me, literally, to my face, that when they have Dr. Paul on, the ratings go up.
[00:45:05.287 --> 00:45:08.149]  So that's another metric that shows popularity.
[00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:16.536]  When we go to these rallies, when we used to have 200 people show up six months ago, and now we have 1,500 people show up, that's another metric.
[00:45:17.417 --> 00:45:18.538]  Well you had 5,000 at one rally!
[00:45:19.992 --> 00:45:23.333]  Oh, right, yeah, 5,000 at the Philadelphia rally, which is our biggest one, you're right.
[00:45:23.653 --> 00:45:34.357]  But, I mean, that was a special event, but rallies are growing, the money's coming in, as we know, the popularity, the letters to the editor, ratings when Dr. Paul's on television and radio.
[00:45:34.397 --> 00:45:37.518]  The buzz is growing exponentially, they're scared.
[00:45:37.758 --> 00:45:40.739]  Do you think it's going to backfire on Fox engaging in this censorship?
[00:45:41.818 --> 00:45:45.480]  I think it can, and I hope that we make it backfire on them.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.681]  I really do.
[00:45:47.882 --> 00:46:00.249]  What's the campaign's stance, or your personal view, on people boycotting sponsors if they do indeed try to frustrate the electoral process and people's right to choose?
[00:46:00.954 --> 00:46:06.698]  Oh, I think boycotts are always effective in a lot of different situations, and that's something that the individual consumer can do.
[00:46:07.238 --> 00:46:11.701]  And I would encourage them to express their disappointment and anger that way.
[00:46:11.742 --> 00:46:12.382]  I mean, why not?
[00:46:12.422 --> 00:46:14.824]  I think boycotts are a great thing to do.
[00:46:14.904 --> 00:46:17.706]  And by the way, I don't think those sponsors should be mad at Ron Paul or us.
[00:46:18.086 --> 00:46:25.851]  We're not the ones making the bad decision Fox has done to not put the most popular candidate in these debates, and he's the one that's gotten all the buzz.
[00:46:26.572 --> 00:46:27.172]  That's a fact.
[00:46:27.212 --> 00:46:29.734]  I mean, they're the ones hurting their sponsors by doing this.
[00:46:30.481 --> 00:46:33.544]  Yeah, and let's predict in terms of tomorrow.
[00:46:33.584 --> 00:46:40.510]  Let's say, I mean, whatever happens tomorrow, I think I'm encouraged, again, by what we're hearing here on the ground in Iowa.
[00:46:42.705 --> 00:46:53.631]  You know, I hope that after tomorrow's caucus in Iowa, that Fox News is such a pickle that they have no choice other than to admit that they were wrong, include Dr. Paul, and we'll go from there.
[00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:54.752]  We're talking to Ken Schneider.
[00:46:54.772 --> 00:46:56.132]  I've got about two minutes left with him.
[00:46:56.693 --> 00:47:01.075]  He is the head of the Ron Paul 2008 campaign, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:47:01.095 --> 00:47:01.956]  More money is needed.
[00:47:01.996 --> 00:47:04.277]  Continue, folks, more grassroots efforts.
[00:47:04.797 --> 00:47:06.539]  I'm getting back to grassroots efforts.
[00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:08.961]  They're in Iowa, coming up in New Hampshire.
[00:47:09.321 --> 00:47:19.669]  Just because you talked to grandma or your cousin or your old boss or your neighbor who moved or say you live there, just because you talked to them and they said, yeah, they're going to go vote for Ron Paul, call them again tonight.
[00:47:19.729 --> 00:47:20.450]  Call them in the morning.
[00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:25.433]  If it's iced up or rainy or their hips hurt, go load up a couple of your friends and neighbors.
[00:47:25.493 --> 00:47:26.334]  Take them to the polls.
[00:47:26.394 --> 00:47:27.215]  Ken, is that a good idea?
[00:47:28.318 --> 00:47:30.881]  It's an excellent idea, and that's what we're telling people here.
[00:47:30.901 --> 00:47:32.703]  You know, it's cold here.
[00:47:32.903 --> 00:47:35.726]  I think the weather's going to be fairly clear, but it's going to be cold.
[00:47:36.607 --> 00:47:45.816]  But the bottom line is that people, all of this stuff, the millions of dollars that have been spent by our campaign and other campaigns, a year's worth of work,
[00:47:46.286 --> 00:47:46.366]  It's
[00:48:08.191 --> 00:48:11.272]  Drive to your caucus, cast a vote for Dr. Paul.
[00:48:11.632 --> 00:48:12.813]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:48:12.853 --> 00:48:16.334]  And in the few minutes we've got left here, Ken Snyder, I've got two final questions.
[00:48:17.435 --> 00:48:19.536]  There are different grassroots organizations that have formed.
[00:48:21.256 --> 00:48:28.499]  What type of hanky-panky, because we know there's always election fraud and chicanery going on, what type of hanky-panky should people look for?
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.441]  Well, I mean, they should, well, I'll answer it this way.
[00:48:32.761 --> 00:48:35.602]  They should simply make sure that it's
[00:48:36.092 --> 00:48:38.294]  That the results are counted fairly and accurately.
[00:48:38.834 --> 00:48:41.036]  We've got the systems in place to do that.
[00:48:41.096 --> 00:48:44.438]  I know there's some other organizations that are doing it as well.
[00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:47.521]  But, I mean, that's what we should expect, obviously.
[00:48:47.541 --> 00:48:48.121]  This is America.
[00:48:48.141 --> 00:48:50.563]  It's not, you know, Venezuela or Peru.
[00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:55.847]  And obviously, Ron Paul voters need to seek out media outside polling places and let them know they voted for Ron Paul.
[00:48:56.511 --> 00:48:58.173]  Oh yeah, exactly, exactly.
[00:48:58.253 --> 00:49:01.757]  So people, outside groups as you're talking about, are doing things.
[00:49:01.797 --> 00:49:04.479]  The campaign, we're very much involved in that as well.
[00:49:06.261 --> 00:49:11.527]  So get people out to vote, and we'll make sure that the votes are counted properly.
[00:49:12.023 --> 00:49:13.704]  RonPaul2008.com.
[00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.405]  Also, you can pray for the campaign.
[00:49:15.445 --> 00:49:16.646]  Pray for Ron Paul's safety.
[00:49:16.686 --> 00:49:17.906]  He was on five months ago.
[00:49:17.946 --> 00:49:21.248]  I brought up the fact that there's political assassinations.
[00:49:21.288 --> 00:49:24.270]  I asked him about security, if the campaign got big, as it has.
[00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.591]  And he said, oh, he knows that that is a threat.
[00:49:26.611 --> 00:49:29.312]  We have that up on PrisonPlanet.com, that interview.
[00:49:30.013 --> 00:49:34.715]  Now we've seen the big Philadelphia bloggers say they hope he gets killed.
[00:49:35.156 --> 00:49:36.256]  Then they retracted that.
[00:49:36.676 --> 00:49:41.159]  We've seen Huckabee people on his blog saying they hope Ron Paul dies.
[00:49:41.679 --> 00:49:47.185]  We know there's a lot of crazies out there, we know you guys are working on security, but any comments on that?
[00:49:48.746 --> 00:49:54.452]  No, I don't really want to say too much other than we are mindful of the situation and that's all I'll say at this point.
[00:49:55.453 --> 00:49:57.956]  But people need to know, he does have serious security.
[00:49:58.556 --> 00:50:01.039]  Yes.
[00:50:01.159 --> 00:50:03.802]  It's amazing to have mainline sites come out like that.
[00:50:03.842 --> 00:50:04.863]  They must be scared, Ken.
[00:50:05.942 --> 00:50:06.683]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:06.743 --> 00:50:07.443]  Well, I think so.
[00:50:07.463 --> 00:50:09.184]  I mean, again, these people are not stupid.
[00:50:09.224 --> 00:50:11.006]  They're wrong in a lot of things.
[00:50:12.167 --> 00:50:14.448]  But, you know, they're not stupid.
[00:50:14.528 --> 00:50:16.690]  And so they are realizing what is happening.
[00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:25.976]  As you know, when we started this, what, months and months ago, when we did one of the first interviews early this year, we, you know, predicted that people would just ignore us.
[00:50:26.637 --> 00:50:30.520]  And, you know, which is what they should do if you're in their position.
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.121]  But now they can't ignore us.
[00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:35.633]  So now they have to go and try to fight us and beat us down.
[00:50:35.673 --> 00:50:36.593]  But that's not going to work.
[00:50:37.454 --> 00:50:38.234]  Absolutely.
[00:50:38.314 --> 00:50:43.617]  You have forced them to engage you and they're only getting more blood loss in this political fight.
[00:50:43.857 --> 00:50:46.019]  Ken Snyder, thank you so much, sir.
[00:50:46.059 --> 00:50:46.899]  We're praying for you.
[00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:48.640]  And we've got Ron Paul coming on tomorrow.
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:49.561]  Ken Snyder, thank you.
[00:50:50.161 --> 00:50:50.661]  Thanks a lot.
[00:50:51.362 --> 00:50:55.624]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, after this quick break with a ton of other geopolitical news.
[00:50:55.904 --> 00:50:56.965]  More Ron Paul news.
[00:50:56.985 --> 00:50:57.485]  Stay with us.

[00:51:14.835 --> 00:51:21.279]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[00:51:22.039 --> 00:51:22.520]  We're good to go!
[00:51:44.563 --> 00:51:46.665]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:51:46.705 --> 00:51:48.686]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[00:51:48.767 --> 00:51:53.270]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.672]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:51:55.852 --> 00:51:59.415]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:51:59.515 --> 00:52:00.796]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:52:01.797 --> 00:52:03.218]  It is a big idea.
[00:52:04.279 --> 00:52:05.300]  A new world order.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:10.244]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:52:10.904 --> 00:52:12.586]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.983]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[00:52:16.523 --> 00:52:18.966]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:52:19.707 --> 00:52:27.016]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:35.032]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:52:35.492 --> 00:52:38.774]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:52:38.814 --> 00:52:41.896]  Bill and Pergis are making great progress toward a world government.
[00:52:41.936 --> 00:52:43.057]  Most people have no idea.
[00:52:43.117 --> 00:52:43.817]  They're not after money.
[00:52:43.837 --> 00:52:44.958]  They have all the money they need.
[00:52:45.178 --> 00:52:45.878]  They're after power.
[00:52:45.898 --> 00:52:46.999]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[00:52:47.299 --> 00:52:51.842]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:52:52.062 --> 00:52:55.084]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:52:55.184 --> 00:52:55.684]  Endgame.
[00:52:59.215 --> 00:53:00.078]  I've been warned.
[00:53:01.522 --> 00:53:03.889]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:53:04.438 --> 00:53:07.741]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:11.083]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:53:11.344 --> 00:53:17.708]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:22.212]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:53:22.452 --> 00:53:26.816]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:53:26.956 --> 00:53:32.340]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of US debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:35.343]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:53:35.383 --> 00:53:39.646]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:53:39.706 --> 00:53:40.567]  Treasury bonds.
[00:53:40.827 --> 00:53:45.452]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:53:45.632 --> 00:53:47.273]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:53:47.293 --> 00:53:48.875]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:54:17.948 --> 00:54:28.973]  A little piece of you, a little piece of me, will die a little.
[00:54:29.754 --> 00:54:32.415]  For this is not America.
[00:54:42.819 --> 00:54:43.579]  We're back live.
[00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:46.961]  Your call is coming up in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:47.021 --> 00:54:52.985]  The websites are TruthNews.us.
[00:54:53.525 --> 00:54:54.806]  TruthNews.us.
[00:54:54.846 --> 00:54:56.747]  That sucker's updated four or five times a day.
[00:54:57.167 --> 00:55:00.169]  You can also post in real time on all the stories.
[00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.651]  Uncensored right there for you.
[00:55:04.691 --> 00:55:12.878]  And you can also go to the PrisonPlanet.com forum and discuss or talk about whatever you'd like there at the Prison Planet Forum.
[00:55:12.898 --> 00:55:24.247]  You can also go to my MySpace account, link through at InfoWars.com, and we basically take anybody who'd like to be a friend of the site and be able to post there on our MySpace account as well.
[00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:29.872]  It is now coming out that they've interviewed the actual doctors at the hospital.
[00:55:30.052 --> 00:55:33.335]  Benazir Bhutto was filled with bullet holes, as we already knew.
[00:55:34.085 --> 00:55:40.689]  The government, because they had assassins obviously doing it, tried to cover that up, and now they've had to backtrack.
[00:55:40.729 --> 00:55:42.730]  The government's saying, okay, now she was shot.
[00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:51.836]  Because there's video of her with machine gun bullets pounding into her, and she slams up against the... they claim she hit her head on the car.
[00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:56.598]  I mean, just unbelievable lies by these people.
[00:55:56.999 --> 00:56:00.241]  Now, that would work before the internet and alternative media back in 1963.
[00:56:02.814 --> 00:56:05.537]  I mean, they could sit there and just pump him full of holes.
[00:56:05.577 --> 00:56:08.660]  There could be bullet fragments flying up and bloodying people in the face.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:16.827]  There could be everybody seeing plumes of smoke and tramps running off and you grab them and they're all top CIA or convicted hitmen.
[00:56:16.847 --> 00:56:19.770]  You could even walk the patsy up.
[00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:24.194]  The cops can hold him up waiting for the shooter and, you know, hold him up for execution.
[00:56:26.335 --> 00:56:29.038]  But you can't do that anymore, can you boys?
[00:56:30.501 --> 00:56:32.482]  I mean, if you're going to train your hijackers at U.S.
[00:56:32.502 --> 00:56:40.704]  military bases and give them high-level security clearances and let them go in and out of the country and order FBI agents not to stop them, it's going to come out.
[00:56:41.424 --> 00:56:54.208]  And you can try to have your little buddies come out and say the towers were hit by space beams or no planes hit them, try to make us look like kooks, but real people are going to figure out your trick there, too, and they have figured it out, and you have failed there as well.
[00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:58.429]  You've now failed with your WMD lies.
[00:56:58.469 --> 00:57:00.010]  You've now failed everywhere.
[00:57:01.144 --> 00:57:13.894]  You're failing on every single front, and your tricks are failing, and all your COINTELPRO on the web, pulling out every stop of mudslinging and infighting, that's all falling flat on its pancake face.
[00:57:16.295 --> 00:57:20.879]  And so I say, stick in your eye, you criminals.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:28.645]  You know, I'd tell you to repent of your wicked ways, and I'd tell you a lot of your minions still can repent, but for many of the New World Order people, they've gone too far.
[00:57:29.531 --> 00:57:33.213]  They've willfully turned themselves over to absolute darkness.
[00:57:34.094 --> 00:57:36.335]  They've wedded themselves to death.
[00:57:37.796 --> 00:57:46.840]  They have wedded themselves to absolute darkness, absolute pet of hell activity, and so the New World Order is your just dessert.
[00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:49.522]  It is what you wanted, and it is what you get.
[00:57:49.742 --> 00:57:51.943]  This is what you want, this is what you get.
[00:57:51.963 --> 00:57:54.985]  This is what you want, want, want, this is what you get.
[00:57:55.848 --> 00:58:04.872]  In closing, in this hour, I would encourage everyone to visit PrisonPlanet.tv and get the New Year Special.
[00:58:04.912 --> 00:58:06.092]  It will only run for a few more weeks.

[00:58:08.913 --> 00:58:10.274]  In April it will be four years we've had the site.

[00:59:10.236 --> 00:59:14.337]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.877 --> 00:59:24.040]  It's been a year plus since they approved the hemipapilloma virus for mass use, though it's still listed as experimental.
[00:59:25.043 --> 00:59:27.985]  Cause quite a few deaths, serious autoimmune diseases.
[00:59:28.985 --> 00:59:32.367]  I know we're talking horror movie blood coming out of the eyes of every other whore of us.
[00:59:33.728 --> 00:59:38.770]  We've got an expert coming on, an investigative journalist who's been tracking all this, coming up in the next hour.
[00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:49.336]  In this hour we're going to have open phones, talk about campaign 2008, talk about Benazir Bhutto, talk about a bunch of big brother police state news I've got here in front of me as well.
[00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:51.989]  But right now, let's start going to your calls.
[00:59:52.089 --> 00:59:54.290]  Mohammed, Mike, Leo, Robert, Mike, many others.
[00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:56.930]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:59:58.871 --> 01:00:02.172]  Mohammed in Britannia, or Obeon, I should say.
[01:00:02.192 --> 01:00:04.412]  I like the ancient name of England, don't you?
[01:00:05.312 --> 01:00:06.773]  Mohammed from Obeon.
[01:00:06.793 --> 01:00:07.753]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:00:07.773 --> 01:00:09.493]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:00:09.793 --> 01:00:10.913]  Good, what's on your mind today?
[01:00:10.933 --> 01:00:18.495]  Alright, I actually just called to... I've got just a couple of points.
[01:00:19.318 --> 01:00:20.399]  That I just wanted to express.
[01:00:20.619 --> 01:00:22.800]  First of all, I really have a great respect for you.
[01:00:24.101 --> 01:00:26.002]  And, uh, I think you're doing a great job.
[01:00:26.863 --> 01:00:29.985]  But, uh, I should admit that I'm really confused, you know.
[01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:35.608]  Because, uh... Have you heard of Aramco before?
[01:00:36.649 --> 01:00:36.969]  Yes.
[01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:38.950]  You have heard of Aramco?
[01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:41.391]  Yes, why don't you... Sorry?
[01:00:42.112 --> 01:00:44.213]  Yeah, the oil company in Iran.
[01:00:44.233 --> 01:00:45.894]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:46.234 --> 01:00:48.716]  Aramco is the Arabian-American oil company
[01:00:49.397 --> 01:00:52.898]  This is the biggest oil company in the world, in the world.
[01:00:53.939 --> 01:00:57.020]  No, I know, but they've been involved trying to get back into Iran.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.101]  No, no, no.
[01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:01.762]  It was Anglo-American oil, and then a bunch of mergers happened, wasn't it in the 50s?
[01:01:02.723 --> 01:01:04.443]  And then Aramco was also in Libya?
[01:01:04.463 --> 01:01:05.744]  This is Saudi-based.
[01:01:05.764 --> 01:01:07.204]  This is only Saudi-based, okay?
[01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:09.325]  Well, I know about Aramco, but just fill me in.
[01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:10.866]  I'm trying to go back to memory there.
[01:01:10.966 --> 01:01:17.849]  Aramco is a Saudi-based, you know, Saudi-American company, okay?
[01:01:19.223 --> 01:01:24.144]  See, my memory tells me the British are involved in that from what I've read, but fill me in.
[01:01:24.784 --> 01:01:26.845]  I mean, you can go and search this in Wikipedia.
[01:01:26.885 --> 01:01:27.865]  No, no, I believe you.
[01:01:27.925 --> 01:01:28.385]  I believe you.
[01:01:28.465 --> 01:01:29.806]  I've got a lot of information about that.
[01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:35.167]  But Aramco... I just know Aramco's been real mad at Iran in the reports I've seen.
[01:01:35.207 --> 01:01:39.208]  Aren't they always trying to push to overthrow things there?
[01:01:39.828 --> 01:01:40.488]  Yeah, okay.
[01:01:40.528 --> 01:01:44.109]  You know, Saudi is the biggest oil producer in the world, right?
[01:01:44.129 --> 01:01:44.609]  Yes, yes.
[01:01:44.649 --> 01:01:46.450]  They produce 10 million barrels a day.
[01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.230]  They're the King Daddy's OPEC, yeah.
[01:01:48.612 --> 01:01:49.452]  Yeah, okay.
[01:01:49.953 --> 01:02:13.044]  The thing is, what I'm really confused about about your campaign, okay, although I really respect you, is that, you know, when you mentioned last time, not last time, I mean, you know, I just listened to this on YouTube, when you said that a big portion of Fox News is owned by Arabs, and Hollywood is owned by Arabs, you know, I wonder where do you want to go with this?
[01:02:13.844 --> 01:02:16.085]  Well, no, let me be specific on that.
[01:02:16.305 --> 01:02:17.326]  I was saying that
[01:02:18.223 --> 01:02:26.487]  That the stock markets are being bought up by elite rich Arab families.
[01:02:26.647 --> 01:02:28.608]  If you'd like, I'll actually go pull all the numbers up.
[01:02:28.908 --> 01:02:33.010]  Let me just put you on hold so I can answer this question, and I'm going to let you come back and comment on it.
[01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:36.132]  Because here's the problem.
[01:02:36.192 --> 01:02:42.215]  I've studied all this stuff, and then you bring it up, and it takes me usually a few seconds to try to go back and pull up my memory on it.
[01:02:43.075 --> 01:02:46.057]  And that's been misrepresented or taken out of context, what I've said.
[01:02:46.664 --> 01:02:52.189]  Hollywood was founded by New York Jewish interests, and Hollywood is about 80% Jewish.
[01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:55.231]  That is the, you know, the owners of the major institutions.
[01:02:55.591 --> 01:03:02.577]  And then, for some reason, like, 15% of the rest is owned by Italians, because they financed a lot of the Jews that went out there.
[01:03:03.077 --> 01:03:07.501]  And, believe me, I've been out to Hollywood quite a few times, and a lot of people, there are a lot of Italians involved as well.
[01:03:08.902 --> 01:03:11.224]  And so that's clear.
[01:03:11.344 --> 01:03:15.287]  But now, the big multinational conglomerates,
[01:03:15.976 --> 01:03:23.560]  That are buying up movie chains, and buying up major pieces of Universal, and Sony, and you name it.
[01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:24.861]  Our era.
[01:03:26.021 --> 01:03:39.589]  And a couple months ago, when I talked about that, Mohamed, I was mentioning that the majority of world stock markets, and that was in the Financial Times of London, London Guardian, were now controlled and owned
[01:03:40.745 --> 01:03:53.030]  By the Saudi princes, by folks out of Dubai, Qatar, Jordan, and I was saying that there's a diverse power elite.
[01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:55.531]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:56.591 --> 01:03:57.632]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.352 --> 01:04:02.654]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:04:03.234 --> 01:04:05.415]  It's known as the Bilderberg disease.
[01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:08.216]  Both their objectives being world domination
[01:04:08.851 --> 01:04:11.314]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:19.325]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.386 --> 01:04:27.348]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.808 --> 01:04:31.270]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:34.211]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[01:04:34.251 --> 01:04:35.212]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.232 --> 01:04:36.172]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.192 --> 01:04:37.273]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.493 --> 01:04:37.893]  They're after power.
[01:04:37.913 --> 01:04:39.314]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:05:56.075 --> 01:06:01.299]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:01.599 --> 01:06:06.884]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:07.304 --> 01:06:08.445]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.805 --> 01:06:17.653]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:18.113 --> 01:06:19.715]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.

[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:58.583]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.943 --> 01:07:01.244]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:14.219]  Okay, during that short three-minute break, I typed Dubai Buy Stock Exchange into Google and clicked News.
[01:07:14.279 --> 01:07:16.922]  I got 152 news stories.
[01:07:17.683 --> 01:07:23.830]  Board of Swedish Sweden OMX recommends Bors deal bid NASDAQ OMX share.
[01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:30.287]  And then you can type Arabs buy British Stock Exchange.
[01:07:30.327 --> 01:07:33.029]  You can type, I mean, just any stock exchange you want.
[01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:34.930]  Asian stock exchanges, you name it.
[01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:37.131]  And of course, this is the problem you get into.
[01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:41.274]  I come on air and I say, the Pope's called for a new world order.
[01:07:43.756 --> 01:07:47.118]  Tony Blair's become a Catholic, so he can be the head of Catholic Europe.
[01:07:47.777 --> 01:07:53.640]  They had said that if he could force England or try to force England into the EU, he would get the EU chairmanship.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.501]  And they said, oh no, that's rotating.
[01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:56.461]  He's not allowed to have it.
[01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:57.922]  England won't get it for six more years.
[01:07:58.242 --> 01:08:00.203]  And I said, you just watch and now it's happening.
[01:08:00.223 --> 01:08:02.484]  And now it's mainstream news that he's doing it.
[01:08:02.504 --> 01:08:04.745]  And then I get calls, you're anti-Catholic.
[01:08:04.785 --> 01:08:05.966]  How dare you bash Catholics?
[01:08:06.366 --> 01:08:07.626]  I have nothing against Catholics.
[01:08:07.787 --> 01:08:09.387]  I'm not Catholic, but I have Catholic friends.
[01:08:09.747 --> 01:08:11.248]  Catholics are good, hardworking people.
[01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:12.929]  I have nothing against Catholics.
[01:08:13.907 --> 01:08:16.049]  I mean, against Protestants, but Pat Robertson, I do.
[01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:21.013]  He calls for abortion in China and says that Giuliani's good.
[01:08:21.273 --> 01:08:23.175]  See, I don't get into all these groups.
[01:08:23.755 --> 01:08:37.085]  When I say Saudi Arabia imports the sex slaves and their 10,000-plus princes are absolutely out of control and decadent, I grew up in Dallas, folks.
[01:08:37.145 --> 01:08:37.646]  I've seen it.
[01:08:37.706 --> 01:08:41.709]  Had some of them living in the neighborhood, up on the end of the neighborhood with the big mansions in it.
[01:08:42.958 --> 01:08:44.078]  These are the low-level people.
[01:08:44.959 --> 01:08:46.559]  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I've seen it.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:50.701]  And, you know, I talk about their incredible corruption, how they're in bed with the U.S.
[01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:55.803]  government, staging terror attacks, how they were in bed funding the Mujahideen against the Russians.
[01:08:56.844 --> 01:09:00.545]  You know, and again, I'm not saying the Mujahideen was bad against the Russians.
[01:09:00.825 --> 01:09:03.406]  The point is, they didn't start fighting back in the mid-'80s.
[01:09:03.646 --> 01:09:06.427]  They started the attacks on the Russians, and the U.S.
[01:09:06.447 --> 01:09:07.348]  was funding them to do it.
[01:09:07.388 --> 01:09:08.148]  It was a setup.
[01:09:09.384 --> 01:09:10.045]  And the U.S.
[01:09:10.245 --> 01:09:12.167]  funded Muslims to attack the Serbs.
[01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:17.472]  And then Muslims call up and say, how dare you say those weren't freedom fighters against the evil Serbs?
[01:09:17.733 --> 01:09:18.473]  Hey, whatever.
[01:09:18.513 --> 01:09:19.835]  You had the New World Order backing you.
[01:09:20.215 --> 01:09:21.436]  The Arabs aren't clean.
[01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:23.398]  The Persians aren't clean.
[01:09:23.418 --> 01:09:24.599]  The Americans aren't clean.
[01:09:24.619 --> 01:09:25.701]  The Jews aren't clean.
[01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:26.842]  The Brits aren't clean.
[01:09:27.302 --> 01:09:29.965]  Evil is in high places, just like the Bible says.
[01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:33.649]  I mean, we wrote articles about it.
[01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:34.810]  We posted the articles.
[01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:39.532]  The British Stock Exchange is now 50 plus percent owned by a consortium of Arabs.
[01:09:41.313 --> 01:09:42.153]  Fox News.
[01:09:42.893 --> 01:09:47.675]  Murdoch only has, last time I checked from memory, like 29 percent, but he has the largest
[01:09:49.298 --> 01:09:50.059]  I mean, it's public.
[01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:21.671]  The Karwal Group, Queen of England, then it's the Bin Laden's under that, then the Bush's.
[01:10:22.872 --> 01:10:25.673]  Now, does that then indict all Arabs?
[01:10:25.953 --> 01:10:26.253]  No!
[01:10:27.633 --> 01:10:29.474]  But everybody knows those Arabs are puppets.
[01:10:30.334 --> 01:10:32.335]  Everybody knows the British created Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:36.276]  Everybody knows that they went into Egypt, everywhere else.
[01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:37.276]  They set up Iraq.
[01:10:37.796 --> 01:10:39.417]  They did what they want, when they wanted.
[01:10:39.437 --> 01:10:42.618]  They helped break up the Ottoman Empire after World War I.
[01:10:43.755 --> 01:10:53.777]  And broke up a lot of it before World War I. And so when I say that the Arabs are coming in and owning large sections of Hollywood, that's true.
[01:10:53.797 --> 01:10:54.397]  Do they run it?
[01:10:55.198 --> 01:10:55.418]  No.
[01:10:55.938 --> 01:10:58.298]  But do they own large sectors of it?
[01:10:58.378 --> 01:11:02.439]  And are some of the major production houses now leveraged and owned?
[01:11:02.679 --> 01:11:05.580]  I mean, my gosh, all these state funds now.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:09.061]  And AAA rated corporate paper that wasn't AAA.
[01:11:10.498 --> 01:11:21.423]  I mean, in the last month, it's been nine times out of ten, it's Arabs coming in with all the oil money, with the depressed dollar being down, and they've got petrodollars that are above that, and there's other investments.
[01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:22.524]  They're buying up everything.
[01:11:23.284 --> 01:11:26.325]  I mean, is it any secret that the Japanese in the 80s bought a bunch of stuff?
[01:11:27.266 --> 01:11:28.786]  Does that say Japanese run everything?
[01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:29.467]  No, it doesn't.
[01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:33.268]  I'm just stating who's buying up this country.
[01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:36.270]  Americans own the minority of this country now.
[01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:37.730]  You want to know who owns this country?
[01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:38.731]  Let me just go down the list for you.
[01:11:40.294 --> 01:11:55.764]  British royal families, British dynasties, then Jewish dynasties, then after that you get German dynasties, then after that you get Arab dynasties, then you get Japanese dynasties, and I mean, Forbes does a list of them.
[01:11:57.205 --> 01:11:58.526]  And that's who owns this country.
[01:11:59.627 --> 01:12:04.610]  And they're all in the same club, they all go to the Bilderberg Group together, they're all in bed together.
[01:12:05.473 --> 01:12:08.515]  And they can care less about, you know, whether they're Arab or Jewish.
[01:12:08.916 --> 01:12:11.978]  They just like to go around and stage terror attacks and control us the cattle.
[01:12:12.518 --> 01:12:13.599]  So, Mohammed, you've got the floor.
[01:12:13.659 --> 01:12:15.080]  Go ahead and finish up any statements you've got.
[01:12:16.321 --> 01:12:19.963]  I just wanted to make... OK, you make a lot of sense there, OK?
[01:12:19.983 --> 01:12:21.625]  Can I just add a piece of information there?
[01:12:22.225 --> 01:12:23.346]  OK, I agree with that.
[01:12:23.866 --> 01:12:28.850]  And I've even heard that almost 20% of Citigroup is owned by Waleed Bin Talal.
[01:12:29.753 --> 01:12:31.894]  Well, there's no hurt about it.
[01:12:31.934 --> 01:12:34.576]  They just came in and bailed Citigroup out a month and a half ago.
[01:12:34.856 --> 01:12:35.797]  Yeah, I understand that.
[01:12:35.877 --> 01:12:36.437]  I understand that.
[01:12:37.057 --> 01:12:37.337]  Okay?
[01:12:37.938 --> 01:12:42.681]  But, do you understand that the Saudi government, okay?
[01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:46.623]  I mean, first of all, calling the country Saudi Arabia is racist, okay?
[01:12:48.359 --> 01:12:49.259]  Hello, can you hear me there?
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.080]  Okay, well, what would you like me to call it?
[01:12:51.461 --> 01:12:55.042]  No, no, I'm saying them calling it Saudi Arabia.
[01:12:55.482 --> 01:13:02.286]  You know, imagine, if you become the President of the USA, and you call USA, Jonesia, okay?
[01:13:02.966 --> 01:13:04.987]  Well, that's because it was the House of Saud.
[01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:07.949]  Yeah, but, you see, that's the problem, you know.
[01:13:07.989 --> 01:13:10.210]  No, I know, that's the group, the British.
[01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:13.471]  They're slaves, they're stealing the oil, okay?
[01:13:13.491 --> 01:13:16.753]  Well, I know, sir, I know, they're complete... It's the most corrupt government on Earth, probably.
[01:13:17.634 --> 01:13:18.635]  I know, that's what I'm saying.
[01:13:19.315 --> 01:13:20.196]  Yeah, okay.
[01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.197]  But they don't call the shots, that's the problem, you see.
[01:13:23.217 --> 01:13:24.438]  They don't call the shots.
[01:13:25.039 --> 01:13:27.600]  I'm not saying they should be calling the shots, okay?
[01:13:29.281 --> 01:13:30.662]  Well, no, they don't call the shots.
[01:13:30.682 --> 01:13:32.203]  They're told where to invest their money.
[01:13:32.543 --> 01:13:33.624]  They're told what to do.
[01:13:33.644 --> 01:13:35.085]  You know, they're just slaves, you know.
[01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.306]  Well, the people certainly are slaves over there, you know.
[01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:40.268]  No, I mean, these governments themselves.
[01:13:40.308 --> 01:13:45.171]  Do you know that Bandar bin Sultan, who was, you know, the ambassador of Saudi Arabia to USA for 20 years,
[01:13:46.519 --> 01:13:50.920]  He knew about the attack, you know, the invasion of Iraq before Colin Powell.
[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:51.400]  Do you know that?
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.380]  Yes, of course.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:59.322]  He was informed before the Secretary of State of your country was informed that your country was going to go into Iraq.
[01:13:59.442 --> 01:14:03.343]  Well, of course they had to make sure it was okay because they were going to be there with bases.
[01:14:03.803 --> 01:14:06.563]  So you see what a corrupt network we're talking about here.
[01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:07.764]  It's not even, look, the U.S.
[01:14:07.784 --> 01:14:08.784]  doesn't exist anymore.
[01:14:08.804 --> 01:14:09.264]  You're not.
[01:14:09.884 --> 01:14:17.228]  Going to get, wherever you're from, or whatever you hail as your land, I guess you're British, you're not going to get your country back until the people understand that.
[01:14:17.528 --> 01:14:36.719]  See, as long as the facade goes on, Mohammed, this is a global government of global corporations, with global laws that they set for us, where they financially control everyone, and there's only 20% of the wealth left in the people's hands, they're busy taking that now, and they openly say when that's out of our hands, they don't even need us anymore and they plan to kill us.
[01:14:36.779 --> 01:14:37.499]  I appreciate your call.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.142]  I mean, listen, I've got to jump, Mohammed.
[01:14:40.182 --> 01:14:40.962]  I've got to get to other people.
[01:14:41.022 --> 01:14:42.924]  I had you on for 15 minutes.
[01:14:43.404 --> 01:14:44.445]  Most of it was me babbling.
[01:14:44.465 --> 01:14:46.207]  But call back again some other day and we can talk more.
[01:14:46.627 --> 01:14:47.568]  Michael in New York.
[01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:48.248]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:14:49.269 --> 01:14:50.170]  Michael just dropped.
[01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:51.031]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:52.412]  Leo in Mass.
[01:14:52.452 --> 01:14:52.932]  Go ahead.
[01:14:55.855 --> 01:14:56.515]  Come on, Leo.
[01:14:56.976 --> 01:14:58.137]  Yeah, hi.
[01:14:58.177 --> 01:14:58.417]  Yeah.
[01:14:58.677 --> 01:15:03.381]  Hey, tell me, is a zombie bin Laden really dead?
[01:15:04.984 --> 01:15:21.992]  Yeah, according to CFR people I've talked to, according to a White House source out of Austin, and I've said this six years ago by the way, I mean right after 9-11, actually about five and a half years ago, bin Laden died shortly before 9-11, and they have his body frozen.
[01:15:22.032 --> 01:15:23.452]  He died of kidney failure.
[01:15:23.772 --> 01:15:29.575]  So the family, in exchange for more weapons contracts and building contracts, which they did indeed get,
[01:15:30.315 --> 01:15:34.098]  And that's why they call him a hero in Saudi Arabia and other places in the media.
[01:15:34.418 --> 01:15:39.961]  Even Bandar Bush, the ambassador at the time from Saudi Arabia to the U.S., told Larry King Live, don't talk bad about Bin Laden.
[01:15:40.382 --> 01:15:43.103]  I mean, it's like the two worlds coming together.
[01:15:43.884 --> 01:15:46.005]  Bush's best buddy, they call him Bandar Bush.
[01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:48.427]  That's how they operate.
[01:15:48.767 --> 01:15:52.229]  And so he just took the honor of playing that part.
[01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:54.851]  So does that mean we can fire the Grave Diggers?
[01:15:56.954 --> 01:16:00.517]  Well, I mean, the Special Forces time and time again would capture No.
[01:16:00.537 --> 01:16:00.777]  1, No.
[01:16:00.797 --> 01:16:02.559]  2, and Al-Qaeda in order to release them.
[01:16:02.599 --> 01:16:09.644]  And Special Forces colonels would come back and report on it in the news, and then it would just be buried in the back of the paper.
[01:16:10.545 --> 01:16:18.852]  But yeah, they flew 6,000 Taliban Al-Qaeda commanders out to Pakistan to safety so they can run around and at least play the Hollywood part of it.
[01:16:19.553 --> 01:16:24.657]  And then you've got the grandson of the head of the ADL running everything and is the head Al-Qaeda guy.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:30.264]  And they don't even hide the fact that the ADL, grandson of the ADL, is the new commander!
[01:16:31.144 --> 01:16:32.185]  It's ridiculous!
[01:16:33.146 --> 01:16:43.795]  Anyway, the important thing is, there's this new story out on World Report about the Vice President Cheney's aide getting shot dead at close range.
[01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:46.737]  Is WorldReports.org pretty solid?
[01:16:48.856 --> 01:16:50.037]  I don't know that site.
[01:16:50.077 --> 01:16:50.877]  I've got to go check it.
[01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:54.980]  I saw that this morning and Mike Rivero says it looks like it's a hoax, but I don't know.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:55.841]  I've got to look into it.
[01:16:55.881 --> 01:17:01.165]  I saw that this morning and it doesn't... I mean, we'll find out.
[01:17:04.368 --> 01:17:05.929]  I mean, I've seen some of these other sites.
[01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:08.711]  Oh, and that's something I've never... I've never attacked people that attack me.
[01:17:08.731 --> 01:17:10.392]  I don't know about this World Report thing.
[01:17:10.432 --> 01:17:11.813]  It doesn't look very credible, I'll say that.
[01:17:12.714 --> 01:17:13.855]  But other sites...
[01:17:17.714 --> 01:17:20.235]  that attack me now, I watched what they did.
[01:17:20.356 --> 01:17:22.217]  For a couple years they did credible reports.
[01:17:22.977 --> 01:17:27.299]  Then I started sliding in ways that were clearly meant after they got a name.
[01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.802]  They get a name of credibility, they get ensconced, then they act totally nuts to discredit.
[01:17:32.122 --> 01:17:33.323]  Because they're on payroll to do it.
[01:17:33.723 --> 01:17:36.525]  That's the operating formula.
[01:17:37.845 --> 01:17:41.227]  And this is not to talk about me, it's so you can become informed and know how things work.
[01:17:42.528 --> 01:17:44.429]  And then I would see them suddenly come out and say,
[01:17:48.596 --> 01:17:50.276]  Barbara Olsen is alive.
[01:17:50.316 --> 01:17:53.437]  You know, the lady that supposedly died on 77 and she was arrested.
[01:17:56.118 --> 01:18:02.859]  Or there's 50 trillion that's going to be released to this guy who's friends with the head of the Keebler Elves.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:11.221]  Or nukes are going to go off in Houston and they even have some people, crepes around to kind of create that story.
[01:18:11.481 --> 01:18:16.243]  Or, I'm not even seeing people reporting on it most of the time even know they're being used.
[01:18:19.665 --> 01:18:22.326]  That nuke thing was a little more credible than the other things I mentioned.
[01:18:22.366 --> 01:18:23.506]  I mean, that's really weird.
[01:18:23.606 --> 01:18:24.066]  I'll tell you that.
[01:18:24.106 --> 01:18:25.847]  It stinks, though, big time.
[01:18:26.687 --> 01:18:27.247]  Uh, let me think.
[01:18:27.267 --> 01:18:29.748]  I mean, it's always the same players, though.
[01:18:30.908 --> 01:18:35.750]  You know, just putting out wild... You know, there were shootouts in the Chicago subway.
[01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:37.350]  Mossad saved us.
[01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:39.351]  There were shootouts in the New York subway.
[01:18:40.891 --> 01:18:47.053]  That gets a lot of attention, and then it gets discredited, and they pop up under other... And then that's the very crowd that then attacks me.
[01:18:48.114 --> 01:18:49.214]  And that's because...
[01:18:49.984 --> 01:18:51.685]  It's their job to, folks.
[01:18:52.126 --> 01:18:53.247]  My goodness, it's obvious.
[01:18:53.267 --> 01:18:56.809]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:18:57.210 --> 01:19:02.694]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:19:03.274 --> 01:19:03.774]  That's right.
[01:19:04.075 --> 01:19:06.356]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:19:06.697 --> 01:19:13.842]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:19:14.412 --> 01:19:22.094]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:19:22.534 --> 01:19:27.395]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.

[01:19:33.817 --> 01:19:37.961]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[01:21:04.921 --> 01:21:17.406]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.

[01:21:53.163 --> 01:21:58.107]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:21:58.427 --> 01:22:00.309]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:22:00.509 --> 01:22:03.531]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:22:03.731 --> 01:22:06.854]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:22:07.174 --> 01:22:09.055]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[01:22:09.296 --> 01:22:12.999]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:22:13.279 --> 01:22:15.921]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:20.827]  Second Peter says, we have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:22:21.048 --> 01:22:25.353]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:22:25.734 --> 01:22:30.080]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:32.423]  These materials document the global leaders.
[01:22:32.483 --> 01:22:32.723]  We're good.
[01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:26.390]  Day after day Alone on a hill The man with the foolish grin Is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him They can see that he's just a fool And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill Sees the sun going down
[01:23:29.128 --> 01:23:43.420]  See how we've been engineered and designed to just always nitpick at each other down here?
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:44.481]  You ever thrown
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:49.601]  A bunch of crabs into the same bucket whenever you're out crab fishing.
[01:23:49.781 --> 01:23:50.401]  You ever done that?
[01:23:50.961 --> 01:23:55.383]  And you throw a line out there with bacon or whatever or hot dog and they grab on it because they're greedy.
[01:23:55.843 --> 01:23:59.504]  And you just slowly drag them into the shore and throw them in a bucket.
[01:24:00.004 --> 01:24:04.326]  When one starts trying to climb out, the others come over and grab on to him and pull him down with their pinchers.
[01:24:04.346 --> 01:24:09.968]  But as long as you lay in the bottom supine, they leave you alone.
[01:24:10.568 --> 01:24:14.009]  But I see the people starting to break out of that mindset and that's what's exciting.
[01:24:14.942 --> 01:24:17.603]  Let's talk to Robert in Texas, and then Mike in Georgia.
[01:24:18.263 --> 01:24:19.243]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:20.603]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:20.843 --> 01:24:23.544]  I wanted to talk about, do you know who Obama Girl is?
[01:24:24.464 --> 01:24:25.844]  No, I don't know who that is.
[01:24:26.445 --> 01:24:32.166]  Well, Obama Girl is just a blogger on YouTube, probably, you know, corporate back, no doubt.
[01:24:32.666 --> 01:24:39.347]  But she gained a lot of fame by making these videos for Obama's campaign, basically.
[01:24:40.488 --> 01:24:41.988]  And I received
[01:24:42.552 --> 01:24:46.596]  In the MySpace Monthly Newsletter, a video from her.
[01:24:46.616 --> 01:24:49.780]  Of course, you know, MySpace is owned by News Corp.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:57.168]  Yeah, for those that don't know, what MySpace does is, again, they choose what they send out to you.
[01:24:57.528 --> 01:25:02.333]  YouTube chooses what they put up on their main page, and they try to suppress all our stuff.
[01:25:02.633 --> 01:25:02.954]  Go ahead.
[01:25:03.755 --> 01:25:09.939]  Well, so I'm watching this video and it's Obama Girl who is very attractive, I will say that much.
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:18.485]  She's by the pool in a bikini with all of her hot friends and, you know, it's like a pop song format.
[01:25:19.006 --> 01:25:30.534]  And all these guys walk up, you know, your typical feminized American young males with all of their, you know, designer clothing on and their haircuts and all this.
[01:25:31.337 --> 01:25:36.822]  And they come up and the guy pulls out his iPhone to ask for her number.
[01:25:37.663 --> 01:25:42.447]  And she says, I'm sorry, I only want a man who's fighting for the USA.
[01:25:42.928 --> 01:25:50.215]  And then a soldier walks up with his arms crossed and the three guys kind of scurry off very girlishly.
[01:25:50.715 --> 01:25:57.141]  And then the rest of the video is just this huge montage of girls in camouflage bikinis
[01:25:59.798 --> 01:26:01.059]  Send that to Aaron Dykes.
[01:26:01.079 --> 01:26:03.420]  We'll get a Jones Report report up on it.
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.722]  Email it to aaron.infowars.com.
[01:26:06.762 --> 01:26:08.343]  That's the type of stuff we should be reporting on.
[01:26:08.703 --> 01:26:12.765]  You know, I don't watch a lot of TV, but over the holidays I'll watch ten times more than I usually do.
[01:26:12.825 --> 01:26:19.769]  Probably an hour or two a day with family visiting or visiting family with instant total sports worship going on constantly.
[01:26:20.518 --> 01:26:27.783]  And every ad is, the good-looking cool girl buys this product, but the other girl who's a failure doesn't.
[01:26:28.203 --> 01:26:33.727]  Or the guy who gets the girl drinks this beer, but the guy that doesn't get the girl doesn't drink this beer.
[01:26:34.047 --> 01:26:39.971]  Or the guy that gets the girl and the job drives this car, but the guy that doesn't drive the car doesn't.
[01:26:40.351 --> 01:26:42.993]  Or the guy that gets the girl joins the Marine Corps.
[01:26:43.654 --> 01:26:48.637]  No, what you get is injected with cancer viruses, your arms and legs blown off, and no real medical care.
[01:26:49.175 --> 01:26:50.756]  But it's the same thing in Nazi Germany.
[01:26:50.796 --> 01:26:55.360]  They told women, just give sex to men in the military and to the Waffen-SS.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:27:03.366]  And so men would, and they literally had giant public houses where the hottest women in Germany went, just to give themselves to the men.
[01:27:04.426 --> 01:27:05.947]  It's base psychology.
[01:27:06.068 --> 01:27:08.529]  And yeah, of course Fox News is behind Hillary.
[01:27:08.549 --> 01:27:09.610]  They're campaigning for her.
[01:27:09.650 --> 01:27:11.211]  Her VP is going to be Obama.
[01:27:11.251 --> 01:27:12.312]  So Fox is behind him.
[01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:13.193]  That's of course come out.
[01:27:14.702 --> 01:27:20.988]  And then you can't tell Republicans, who are also under the News Corp control, that they just aren't sophisticated enough.
[01:27:21.068 --> 01:27:22.269]  And yeah, that's the bottom line.
[01:27:22.609 --> 01:27:23.130]  I told you.
[01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:31.357]  How many years have I said it's going to be men in black uniforms with armbands, with the most beautiful, dynamic women, worshipping them on television?
[01:27:31.578 --> 01:27:37.023]  Then women in the real world see that and will actually go out and grovel to black uniform Nazis.
[01:27:38.105 --> 01:27:40.030]  And, uh, this is the new system.
[01:27:40.812 --> 01:27:42.718]  And, uh, this is how they operate.
[01:27:42.738 --> 01:27:44.242]  See, we're tribal creatures.
[01:27:44.483 --> 01:27:45.506]  And we go by example.
[01:27:46.087 --> 01:27:55.971]  And so, Fox Media and all their incarnations, if you notice, also always shows men as chicken-necked, pathetic creatures.
[01:27:56.051 --> 01:27:58.852]  The women never like seeing them with a sword or a gun.
[01:27:59.152 --> 01:28:01.073]  The women always boss them around.
[01:28:01.093 --> 01:28:09.116]  The men are like frozen at age 10, picking their nose, making fart jokes, unable to string a sentence together.
[01:28:09.136 --> 01:28:12.858]  And they'll also have a nerd-type guy who gets the girl, though.
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:31.429]  And then see men see that and then they at a subconscious level were meant to see the big tribal leader who could kick anybody's butt, who could march up the hill, who could hunt down the grizzly, who could do everything, who could navigate through the fords, who could, you know, traverse the planet in their Viking ship.
[01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:32.810]  No, not now.
[01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.931]  It's a little drooling chicken neck.
[01:28:35.371 --> 01:28:39.153]  And the women see that then and think chicken neck them is what they want.
[01:28:39.353 --> 01:28:41.054]  Then they get it and they're not happy.
[01:28:41.154 --> 01:28:42.675]  Then the family falls apart.
[01:28:43.849 --> 01:28:46.851]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.871 --> 01:28:50.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.736 --> 01:28:57.979]  The holidays are here, and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[01:28:58.139 --> 01:29:00.681]  Why not make your New Year's resolution seem healthier?
[01:29:00.881 --> 01:29:05.625]  And the easiest and most delicious way to start is with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.

[01:29:55.952 --> 01:30:00.493]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:30:00.653 --> 01:30:03.774]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?

[01:30:06.155 --> 01:30:08.236]  Plus we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:30:08.416 --> 01:30:14.538]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:30:14.718 --> 01:30:20.020]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:23.142]  Well Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.

[01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:57.891]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:30:58.112 --> 01:31:00.253]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:31:00.393 --> 01:31:02.855]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:31:03.115 --> 01:31:07.458]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:31:07.498 --> 01:31:08.178]  Here's why.
[01:31:08.599 --> 01:31:14.523]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:31:14.543 --> 01:31:20.747]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:31:20.987 --> 01:31:21.928]  But they're not cheating.
[01:31:22.148 --> 01:31:26.150]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:31:26.351 --> 01:31:30.673]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:31:30.774 --> 01:31:35.397]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game.
[01:31:35.417 --> 01:31:38.299]  And above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:31:38.319 --> 01:31:38.939]  Get control.
[01:31:39.159 --> 01:31:39.740]  Get relief.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.500]  Get some sleep.
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:43.802]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[01:31:43.922 --> 01:31:46.404]  That's www.OutIn90.com.
[01:31:46.484 --> 01:31:47.305]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:50.947 --> 01:31:52.788]  I literally burn with passion and desire
[01:32:18.759 --> 01:32:27.206]  I can literally taste it as my teeth clench and lock together.
[01:32:27.226 --> 01:32:36.633]  I can feel my ancestors' victories against tyranny and the great battles they fought.
[01:32:37.273 --> 01:32:40.355]  The struggles of the species.
[01:32:41.216 --> 01:32:44.358]  Everything it is to the human, I can feel it.
[01:32:45.735 --> 01:33:01.686]  Coursing through my very bones, my heart, my guts, the sinews in my forearms, my fists that are cracked and arthritic, burn with power!
[01:33:05.128 --> 01:33:08.611]  All of you have that same human spark.
[01:33:09.438 --> 01:33:12.020]  Your destiny is to build!
[01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:14.883]  Your destiny is to create!
[01:33:15.543 --> 01:33:19.767]  Your destiny is to be free!
[01:33:20.688 --> 01:33:22.289]  Free of bondage!
[01:33:22.369 --> 01:33:25.892]  Free of lesser men's control!
[01:33:27.113 --> 01:33:29.055]  And I want you to stand up!
[01:33:29.950 --> 01:33:31.931]  And I want you to get focused!
[01:33:32.451 --> 01:33:42.136]  And I want you to stop being afraid of turning your own personal destiny and the power that God has put in each of us.
[01:33:42.977 --> 01:33:49.400]  We are literally made in the image of the Creator of the Universe.
[01:33:50.481 --> 01:33:53.782]  Do you realize that's why the New World Order hates you?
[01:33:54.183 --> 01:33:55.803]  That's why the devil hates you?
[01:33:56.784 --> 01:33:58.725]  And that's why they're so afraid of us?
[01:33:59.987 --> 01:34:05.809]  We are literally not even at embryonic form of what humanity is going to become.
[01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:10.651]  We have not even become larva yet, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:11.551 --> 01:34:22.555]  And every ounce of my being only wants to see the species do well, and to grow, and to turn into what we are to become.
[01:34:24.316 --> 01:34:29.458]  All of our trials, all of our tribulations, everything we are,
[01:34:30.473 --> 01:34:38.120]  And you look at who our heroes are today, basketball players, football players, things that mean nothing today and will mean even less tomorrow or next year.
[01:34:39.381 --> 01:34:42.504]  No longer is it the people that stand up against tyranny of the heroes.
[01:34:42.564 --> 01:34:46.047]  No longer is it the people that save burning children from a building.
[01:34:46.828 --> 01:34:51.672]  No longer is it individuals who invent incredible new technologies.
[01:34:51.952 --> 01:34:52.573]  No longer
[01:34:54.326 --> 01:34:57.068]  They know how to take your heroes and give you false heroes.
[01:34:57.389 --> 01:35:00.051]  They know how to punch your buttons and manipulate you.
[01:35:00.391 --> 01:35:04.274]  And it's time that you literally break out of that cage.
[01:35:04.675 --> 01:35:08.038]  It's time for you to bust out and break out like the Incredible Hulk.
[01:35:08.418 --> 01:35:09.879]  It's time to get wild!
[01:35:09.899 --> 01:35:13.862]  There's nothing that can stop us if we just turn it all loose!
[01:35:14.503 --> 01:35:15.684]  Yeah!
[01:35:15.764 --> 01:35:16.385]  Yeah!
[01:35:21.355 --> 01:35:22.876]  I can feel the freedom!
[01:35:23.757 --> 01:35:36.945]  You can break through the New World Order right now!
[01:35:37.646 --> 01:35:40.587]  You can stop being a slave right now!
[01:35:47.987 --> 01:35:50.209]  Just a kiss away.
[01:35:55.313 --> 01:35:57.555]  All these people that hate beauty.
[01:35:58.316 --> 01:35:59.797]  All these people that hate strength.
[01:36:00.378 --> 01:36:06.103]  All these people that want to turn you into a pile of stupid, dull-eyed weakness.
[01:36:06.603 --> 01:36:07.984]  They make me sick!
[01:36:08.985 --> 01:36:11.948]  Everything in me wants light.
[01:36:12.765 --> 01:36:16.047]  And green fields and happiness running over.
[01:36:16.067 --> 01:36:21.351]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, yeah I'm fired up.
[01:36:22.612 --> 01:36:23.773]  I'm real fired up.
[01:36:25.774 --> 01:36:27.395]  Because I know the stakes.
[01:36:27.696 --> 01:36:29.017]  I know the cost.
[01:36:29.537 --> 01:36:30.998]  I know what we're facing.
[01:36:31.518 --> 01:36:41.866]  I know what it means and I refuse to die in some ditch on my knees or in some jail cell with a couple of filthy sadistic pieces of trash having their way with me.
[01:36:42.711 --> 01:36:47.533]  If we're going to go down, we're going to go down fighting 100,000 percent!
[01:36:52.075 --> 01:36:55.957]  In my wild waving of arms, I just knocked all the notes off.
[01:36:58.158 --> 01:36:59.659]  Just IM me who the callers are.
[01:36:59.679 --> 01:37:00.759]  I usually have it on the IM screen.
[01:37:00.779 --> 01:37:02.180]  I've been writing it down on a piece of paper.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:02.920]  They're up in Minnesota.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.921]  I'm down here in Texas.
[01:37:06.275 --> 01:37:07.355]  You bet I'm a maniac.
[01:37:07.375 --> 01:37:08.956]  That's what built this country.
[01:37:08.976 --> 01:37:10.696]  That's what built our civilization.
[01:37:10.976 --> 01:37:11.817]  That's what it's all about.
[01:37:11.857 --> 01:37:13.617]  That's what reality is.
[01:37:14.658 --> 01:37:18.299]  Psyches and intellects and souls on fire.
[01:37:19.979 --> 01:37:20.739]  Gusto.
[01:37:20.919 --> 01:37:24.040]  Life being enjoyed to its fullest.
[01:37:26.121 --> 01:37:27.841]  Thanking God for everything.
[01:37:28.362 --> 01:37:32.843]  The light pouring through the windows, the trees, the birds, the sky, the grass.
[01:37:34.099 --> 01:37:38.901]  Everything is just a magical moment all around you and you're bored!
[01:37:39.721 --> 01:37:40.762]  All around you you're bored.
[01:37:40.802 --> 01:37:48.485]  Well fine, be bored with all the beauty and majesty around you, but you ought to be horrified by the evil breeding and growing all around you.
[01:37:49.885 --> 01:37:57.328]  Believe me, for all the rage and anger I have for the New World Order, and the energy you see and hear manifest because of my anger at them,
[01:37:58.192 --> 01:38:12.657]  It is nothing compared to the absolute happiness and overflowing gift that I thank God for every day that is the beautiful creation and is the amazing gift of consciousness.
[01:38:13.818 --> 01:38:15.198]  Literal consciousness.
[01:38:15.298 --> 01:38:16.119]  I can create.
[01:38:16.559 --> 01:38:17.539]  I can write a book.
[01:38:17.639 --> 01:38:18.660]  I can make a film.
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:19.700]  I can paint.
[01:38:20.732 --> 01:38:22.954]  A field of sunflowers on a canvas.
[01:38:23.494 --> 01:38:26.857]  I can hold my children above me and toss them into the air.
[01:38:27.377 --> 01:38:35.824]  I can drink a big goblet of cold, delicious orange juice and feel the life-giving vitamins as they flood into my stomach.
[01:38:36.544 --> 01:38:38.026]  I can do it all.
[01:38:39.187 --> 01:38:42.049]  And I'm here one time, only one time.
[01:38:52.304 --> 01:38:57.610]  During the break, what got me fired up is I was just thinking about how I wanted to make films about the propaganda of the police state.
[01:38:58.110 --> 01:38:59.472]  I mean, I could make one in a month.
[01:38:59.652 --> 01:39:05.318]  I could just take news clips and drug ads and psychologically sit there and play a clip in front of an audience.
[01:39:05.338 --> 01:39:07.461]  I just want to make 50 films.
[01:39:07.481 --> 01:39:08.262]  I want to make 100 films.
[01:39:08.282 --> 01:39:10.544]  I want to warn people about every FACET OF IT RIGHT NOW!
[01:39:11.225 --> 01:39:12.166]  IT'S ALL DOCUMENTED!
[01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:18.704]  And I can sit there and show them, alright, here's basic mammalian technology.
[01:39:19.005 --> 01:39:28.837]  This guy's drinking this beer, he sees the girl, she looks at the beer, thinks he's pathetic, looks back over at the other meatball who's got the proper beer, and she runs off with him.
[01:39:29.938 --> 01:39:32.141]  Base mammal psychology!
[01:39:33.044 --> 01:39:36.489]  And then they tell you that they're not even propagandizing you.
[01:39:36.529 --> 01:39:38.332]  That is only the tip of it.
[01:39:38.412 --> 01:39:41.396]  And they have all that base psychology for about half the public.
[01:39:41.497 --> 01:39:46.404]  Then they have thousands of other strains and flavors that they use on the rest of you.
[01:39:49.753 --> 01:39:55.017]  And so somebody calls in like that last caller and tells me about the Obama girl with the troops.
[01:39:55.517 --> 01:39:59.420]  I mean, that is the most base fascist propaganda or Soviet propaganda.
[01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:00.101]  They both did it.
[01:40:00.481 --> 01:40:05.245]  The luscious women out there with a gaggle of troops.
[01:40:05.345 --> 01:40:08.247]  And by the way, men, you're not going to get the women.
[01:40:08.934 --> 01:40:11.095]  You're going to get your arms and legs blown off.
[01:40:11.115 --> 01:40:13.476]  You're going to get brainwashed and your head shaved.
[01:40:13.736 --> 01:40:16.938]  And the government will attest chemical and biologicals on you.
[01:40:17.178 --> 01:40:20.960]  And when you're dying of radiation poisoning from DU, they're not going to help you.
[01:40:23.303 --> 01:40:24.084]  That's another thing.
[01:40:24.124 --> 01:40:32.089]  How do they lead all the little kids onto the slave boat in Pinocchio with the beer and cigars and have a party, be radical?
[01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:39.753]  No, because they want you to be a bunch of jackasses and that's what you'll turn into is a bunch of donkeys for slaves to pull stuff out of their minds.
[01:40:45.817 --> 01:40:47.318]  I don't like seeing you be a slave.
[01:40:48.559 --> 01:40:49.599]  I remember being about 11 years old
[01:40:52.403 --> 01:40:53.744]  Well, I started becoming a fighter.
[01:40:54.004 --> 01:40:56.165]  And then later I got pride and then it became something evil.
[01:40:58.086 --> 01:40:58.786]  But it's a drug.
[01:41:00.767 --> 01:41:06.750]  And I remember watching kids who'd flunked two or three grades who had mustaches beating up some little runt.
[01:41:07.131 --> 01:41:08.811]  And I remember going over and telling them to stop.
[01:41:08.852 --> 01:41:15.315]  And I remember them attacking me and fighting back and then not getting in trouble because they, you know, there were witnesses at what they'd done.
[01:41:15.355 --> 01:41:18.657]  And then I remember four kids beating me up who were like 16 later.
[01:41:19.966 --> 01:41:24.469]  You know, when I was like 12, and I remember later finding them and taking three of the four on.
[01:41:24.489 --> 01:41:34.116]  But, you know, the whole point is, is that I have never liked watching some little person cornered with a bunch of scum having their way with them.
[01:41:34.216 --> 01:41:43.823]  And I just literally, at a primitive level with the New World Order, just want to take a big old battle axe and just wade into them and just, you know, just really get into it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:44.063 --> 01:41:45.584]  But I'm going to do that in the Info War.
[01:41:46.304 --> 01:41:48.406]  And so I have all this rage and this energy.
[01:41:49.122 --> 01:41:52.503]  And this tidal force, where I just want to take action against them.
[01:41:52.903 --> 01:41:54.963]  And I want to see you turn it loose!
[01:41:55.824 --> 01:41:56.004]  Ah!
[01:41:56.024 --> 01:41:57.044]  Just turn it loose!
[01:41:57.124 --> 01:41:58.064]  Come on!
[01:41:58.424 --> 01:42:00.125]  You can turn it loose, too!
[01:42:00.665 --> 01:42:01.805]  But it's got to be real!
[01:42:02.445 --> 01:42:04.586]  Not some image or facsimile you've got in your mind.
[01:42:04.606 --> 01:42:09.087]  You've got to really get down into your soul, and you've got to turn loose the freedom.
[01:42:10.067 --> 01:42:11.767]  You've got to really become a human being.
[01:42:11.787 --> 01:42:14.308]  You've got to get back to what it is to be a man, to be a woman.
[01:42:15.703 --> 01:42:23.109]  And all the psychological triggers and bull they've engineered into us to ninny and nitpick and act like a bunch of scumbag monkeys with each other!
[01:42:23.129 --> 01:42:35.639]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you've got the children, so follow the men.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:45.047]  Advertising 101, Edward Bernays, Sigmund Freud, right through to modern time,
[01:42:45.757 --> 01:42:48.679]  They all agree, the woman, you target the woman.
[01:42:48.739 --> 01:42:51.541]  She buys 80% of the household items and products.
[01:42:51.841 --> 01:42:54.603]  She makes the choice, generally, of even the car.
[01:42:54.943 --> 01:42:57.485]  She makes the choice, generally, of the upholstery.
[01:42:57.705 --> 01:42:59.826]  She makes the choice of the plates.
[01:43:00.227 --> 01:43:01.788]  She makes the choice of the deodorant.
[01:43:02.048 --> 01:43:04.109]  She makes the choice of the couches.
[01:43:04.389 --> 01:43:06.451]  She makes the choice of where the kids go to school.
[01:43:06.791 --> 01:43:08.252]  She suddenly does it.
[01:43:08.532 --> 01:43:10.133]  She suddenly runs the cave.
[01:43:10.233 --> 01:43:12.195]  She runs the nest, even if she's working.
[01:43:12.555 --> 01:43:15.537]  So when she's not working, the state now becomes the person running the nest.
[01:43:17.438 --> 01:43:18.398]  But it's more than that.
[01:43:18.718 --> 01:43:22.980]  In sales, what the woman does, the men follow.
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:24.961]  The women have the children.
[01:43:25.681 --> 01:43:27.261]  So follow the men.
[01:43:28.042 --> 01:43:30.643]  First you get the women.
[01:43:31.623 --> 01:43:33.884]  Then you've got the children.
[01:43:34.604 --> 01:43:36.145]  So follow the men.
[01:43:37.365 --> 01:43:39.146]  Women, do you like your liberation?
[01:43:39.666 --> 01:43:42.047]  Do you like what the establishment has given you?
[01:43:42.987 --> 01:43:44.188]  In the name of feminism,
[01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:47.427]  Men don't even desire you anymore.
[01:43:47.467 --> 01:43:50.470]  They're too busy satiating themselves with computer images.
[01:43:53.272 --> 01:43:57.895]  Men act like lobotomized, gibbering monkeys.
[01:44:01.237 --> 01:44:04.880]  All you look good for is for competition with other women when it means nothing.
[01:44:07.085 --> 01:44:14.650]  You end up being 45, you haven't had children, you bought into it, now your clock, your very gut, your soul's telling you you want them, and it's too late?
[01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:16.091]  And what are you gonna find?
[01:44:16.371 --> 01:44:21.134]  Some chicken-necked little penny-pinching yuppie who wants to fart around with you?
[01:44:22.153 --> 01:44:25.175]  And then you'll just end fight with him because that's all you've been trained to do.
[01:44:25.495 --> 01:44:29.177]  Why don't you just take your head and bash it into a wall and get fired up?
[01:44:29.517 --> 01:44:33.139]  Why don't you take all their conditioning and just rip it off of you?
[01:44:33.379 --> 01:44:42.383]  All their labels, all their bull, all the groups you think you're with, all the names, all the liberal, conservative, all of it, and just... Why don't you just start flopping around on the ground?
[01:44:42.423 --> 01:44:44.264]  Why don't you just break all your conditioning?
[01:44:47.346 --> 01:44:47.926]  Get real!
[01:44:51.314 --> 01:44:52.276]  That's what it's all about.
[01:44:53.819 --> 01:44:54.640]  Just get real.
[01:44:55.342 --> 01:44:56.143]  Stop the games.
[01:44:56.183 --> 01:44:57.446]  I've seen most of you adults.
[01:44:57.606 --> 01:44:59.089]  I mean 98% of you put on an act.
[01:45:00.563 --> 01:45:04.365]  You're in a subclass, a sect, a certain little club you're in.
[01:45:04.385 --> 01:45:14.710]  It could be religious, it could be sporting, it could be, oh, I'm a trendy, oh, I'm a, I'm a pib, I'm a liberal, I'm a hippie, I'm a, I'm a cowboy, I'm a blah, blah, blah.
[01:45:14.971 --> 01:45:18.052]  And all of that stuff's fine if it's a very small part of who you are.
[01:45:18.272 --> 01:45:19.413]  But no, that's who you are.
[01:45:19.473 --> 01:45:21.534]  It's like dress-up playland.
[01:45:21.934 --> 01:45:27.617]  It's like when my three-year-old daughter puts on an Indian headdress and dances around in the house, but she's three.
[01:45:27.837 --> 01:45:28.978]  She's supposed to role-play.
[01:45:29.818 --> 01:45:35.863]  But you're an adult, and you go out and you do all these things, and it doesn't change who you are.
[01:45:36.304 --> 01:45:38.185]  That happens on the inside.
[01:45:38.445 --> 01:45:43.369]  And you tell me that your physical manifestation is a manifestation of what is on the inside.
[01:45:45.051 --> 01:45:46.592]  That is not a true action!
[01:45:46.612 --> 01:45:53.258]  An action is how you interface with the world, and how you help others, and how you stand up against scum.
[01:45:53.478 --> 01:45:58.202]  Because part of the equation in life isn't just
[01:45:59.301 --> 01:46:00.181]  Fighting evil.
[01:46:02.163 --> 01:46:03.523]  It's also helping others.
[01:46:04.083 --> 01:46:05.364]  And it's not just helping others.
[01:46:05.704 --> 01:46:06.485]  It's fighting evil.
[01:46:07.185 --> 01:46:08.186]  It's getting scared.
[01:46:08.466 --> 01:46:11.787]  It's putting yourself in that position where you don't know what's going to happen.
[01:46:12.768 --> 01:46:14.349]  It's going across that line.
[01:46:14.989 --> 01:46:16.050]  It's having the will.
[01:46:16.510 --> 01:46:28.176]  And the establishments taught you how to be scared, how to be furtive, how to be timid, how to be knee-knocking, how to be weak, how to shake, how to stay in your house afraid to talk to your neighbor,
[01:46:31.644 --> 01:46:33.386]  To never be involved in your society?
[01:46:33.406 --> 01:46:36.969]  To never strike out on your own in any way?
[01:46:39.451 --> 01:46:45.536]  And so you just sit there rotting and rotting and rotting and rotting and rotting while these people have their way with you.
[01:46:47.305 --> 01:46:53.149]  I don't want to watch them have their way with you anymore, because frankly, if they can have their way with you, they're going to have their way with me.
[01:46:53.369 --> 01:46:56.951]  I've got to get you to wake up so I survive, so my family survives.
[01:46:57.191 --> 01:47:03.495]  But that's at the conscious, cool, calculating, intellectual level that I bring you that news.
[01:47:04.175 --> 01:47:08.858]  I can't help my passion and my love for your liberty at a base instinct level.
[01:47:09.178 --> 01:47:16.683]  It manifests itself, the survival mechanism and the survival instinct that brought us this far in my loving you.
[01:47:18.010 --> 01:47:19.712]  Because it has to feel good.
[01:47:19.792 --> 01:47:21.753]  It's an instinct to help you.
[01:47:22.434 --> 01:47:23.375]  Helping people.
[01:47:23.635 --> 01:47:25.036]  Why does helping people feel good?
[01:47:25.056 --> 01:47:26.397]  Because it's good for the tribe.
[01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:29.140]  Why does having sex feel good?
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.561]  Because it's good for the tribe.
[01:47:33.163 --> 01:47:34.584]  Why does fighting feel good?
[01:47:34.624 --> 01:47:39.208]  Because when the time comes to fight with those that come against your tribe, it feels good.
[01:47:39.449 --> 01:47:42.191]  So they give you sports where you fight in your mind.
[01:47:42.631 --> 01:47:43.632]  Where it isn't even real.
[01:47:43.672 --> 01:47:44.553]  Where you spectate.
[01:47:47.344 --> 01:47:47.624]  I don't know.
[01:48:01.457 --> 01:48:17.652]  And all that, that's what you take your fighting energies that you would use in business or life or the fighting energies to dominate your children so they won't go out and get on drugs, to have them respect you, to also teach them, to teach them about the world, because if you don't dominate them, the government and the media will.
[01:48:19.478 --> 01:48:21.259]  All of that is there for you to leave.
[01:48:21.479 --> 01:48:23.540]  And I'm not up here on a high horse saying I'm perfect.
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:24.120]  Far from it.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:31.943]  The point is you need to be conscious of these things, conscious of that road, because you're on this road whether you want to say you're on the road or not.
[01:48:32.303 --> 01:48:35.665]  And whether you want to try to be a spectator in life, you're not a spectator in life.
[01:48:35.865 --> 01:48:36.885]  That's the dirty trick.
[01:48:37.305 --> 01:48:41.487]  Is they teach you you can just sit back and be in the sidelines and that everything's okay.
[01:48:41.667 --> 01:48:41.807]  No.
[01:48:42.127 --> 01:48:45.829]  Off in the sidelines, off in the woods, is where the wolves come, you fools.
[01:48:51.485 --> 01:48:53.266]  I have committed myself to this 110%.
[01:48:53.947 --> 01:49:03.933]  And that word, committed, like you heard Ken Schneider say in the last hour, you know, why is Ron Paul working 14, 15, 16 hours a day?
[01:49:03.993 --> 01:49:04.734]  Why is he doing it?
[01:49:05.394 --> 01:49:05.835]  Why is he?
[01:49:05.855 --> 01:49:06.875]  Because he's committed!
[01:49:07.796 --> 01:49:11.658]  So if you jump out of that airplane, parachute or not, you're committed.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:14.380]  It's a good feeling too.
[01:49:15.741 --> 01:49:16.742]  Turning loose.
[01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:19.311]  It isn't even trust at that point.
[01:49:19.411 --> 01:49:20.452]  They call it trust in God.
[01:49:20.512 --> 01:49:21.332]  Fine, call it that if you want.
[01:49:21.632 --> 01:49:25.594]  Turning loose, it doesn't even matter about trust anymore.
[01:49:25.915 --> 01:49:27.135]  You have committed.
[01:49:27.155 --> 01:49:29.497]  You have engaged.
[01:49:30.037 --> 01:49:32.158]  You have entered into something new.
[01:49:32.498 --> 01:49:35.600]  Commit today to stop being weak.
[01:49:36.401 --> 01:49:38.882]  Commit today to have real strength.
[01:49:39.674 --> 01:49:49.506]  Commit today to make whatever sacrifices needed that the weak, that the women and children, that the old, that the crippled be protected.
[01:49:50.387 --> 01:49:53.150]  That is the first rule of being a human.
[01:49:53.965 --> 01:49:54.706]  Terrorism!
[01:49:54.866 --> 01:49:55.626]  Terrorism!
[01:49:55.726 --> 01:50:01.811]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:50:02.051 --> 01:50:03.652]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:50:03.892 --> 01:50:06.374]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:50:06.754 --> 01:50:21.324]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:50:21.364 --> 01:50:21.685]  government.
[01:50:21.865 --> 01:50:23.626]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:50:24.026 --> 01:50:29.927]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:50:30.067 --> 01:50:34.568]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:40.289]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:50:40.309 --> 01:50:41.549]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:42.189]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:50:42.209 --> 01:50:44.230]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:50:53.740 --> 01:50:55.120]  It is a big idea.
[01:50:55.140 --> 01:50:57.261]  A new world order.
[01:50:57.981 --> 01:51:02.562]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:51:02.863 --> 01:51:04.623]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:51:04.743 --> 01:51:07.944]  Doesn't their objective be world domination?
[01:51:08.464 --> 01:51:10.925]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:51:11.645 --> 01:51:18.947]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:51:22.014 --> 01:51:26.977]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:51:27.438 --> 01:51:30.900]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:33.822]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:51:33.882 --> 01:51:35.043]  Most people have no idea.
[01:51:35.063 --> 01:51:35.804]  They're not after money.
[01:51:35.824 --> 01:51:36.964]  They have all the money they need.
[01:51:37.084 --> 01:51:37.825]  They're after power.
[01:51:37.845 --> 01:51:38.946]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[01:51:39.246 --> 01:51:46.751]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:51:50.807 --> 01:51:51.947]  You have been warned.
[01:51:52.708 --> 01:51:54.389]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:51:54.669 --> 01:51:56.351]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:51:56.551 --> 01:52:00.574]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:52:00.774 --> 01:52:03.816]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:52:03.976 --> 01:52:07.819]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:52:07.959 --> 01:52:10.361]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:52:10.481 --> 01:52:13.723]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[01:52:13.763 --> 01:52:14.103]  I think so.
[01:52:29.645 --> 01:52:30.306]  We're good to go.
[01:53:00.376 --> 01:53:01.877]  Alright, I'll get you your calls in the next hour.
[01:53:01.917 --> 01:53:03.417]  I know we're loaded up here.
[01:53:05.038 --> 01:53:09.659]  Just getting real with everybody here on air, how I really feel.
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.120]  I'm sorry if it's shocking to some.
[01:53:13.921 --> 01:53:14.801]  Let's pay some bills.
[01:53:16.141 --> 01:53:19.263]  In doing that, I have to also tell you about great products that I personally use.
[01:53:19.783 --> 01:53:20.323]  Both of these.
[01:53:20.963 --> 01:53:23.224]  InnerFood, ladies and gentlemen, and eFoodsDirect.
[01:53:23.264 --> 01:53:26.065]  And I'm going to tell you about both these great product lines.
[01:53:27.853 --> 01:53:28.073]  Yes, we are.
[01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:51.712]  The good news is they at least got hooked up with the Patriot Movement, though I didn't use to return phone calls for sponsorship.
[01:53:51.752 --> 01:53:54.053]  Now we do, because I've got some of the employees I better, or we won't be around.
[01:53:54.653 --> 01:53:57.093]  So I go out and find sponsors I believe in, and one of them is InnerFood.
[01:53:57.433 --> 01:53:58.554]  High-quality green food.
[01:53:58.994 --> 01:53:59.974]  Just really fantastic.
[01:54:00.354 --> 01:54:01.534]  20 power-packed ingredients.
[01:54:01.894 --> 01:54:04.315]  Barley grass, wheat, gorillas, perolina, dull skelp.
[01:54:04.655 --> 01:54:06.915]  That's just, uh, what's that?
[01:54:06.995 --> 01:54:07.676]  Six of them.
[01:54:07.696 --> 01:54:09.556]  There's 14 others.
[01:54:10.036 --> 01:54:11.636]  Just go to InnerFood.com.
[01:54:11.776 --> 01:54:12.857]  E-N-E-R-Food.com.
[01:54:13.137 --> 01:54:13.557]  Check it out.
[01:54:13.597 --> 01:54:14.337]  It's really great stuff.
[01:54:16.591 --> 01:54:17.111]  866-762-9238.
[01:54:17.532 --> 01:54:20.634]  The food's been devalued from the farming and the rest of it.
[01:54:20.654 --> 01:54:21.114]  You know that.
[01:54:21.134 --> 01:54:24.457]  This is just actual boiled down food products.
[01:54:25.197 --> 01:54:26.038]  Boiled's the wrong word.
[01:54:26.058 --> 01:54:27.179]  It hasn't been pasteurized.
[01:54:27.219 --> 01:54:28.540]  It hasn't been heated to loose quality.
[01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.700]  866-762-9238.
[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:29.981]  866-762-9238.
[01:54:30.301 --> 01:54:36.806]  Or when you go to PrisonPlanet.com, link through on my right hand side to InnerFood.com.
[01:54:38.267 --> 01:54:42.970]  And you can link through right there on InnerFood.com and get 10% off when you do that.
[01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:44.231]  I got a bunch of other products too.
[01:54:45.507 --> 01:54:47.108]  Of course, there's a eFoods Direct.
[01:54:48.628 --> 01:54:50.409]  I've gotten affordable food from them twice.
[01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:56.111]  My office, some of the folks in the office have bought little two-month supplies.
[01:54:56.771 --> 01:54:58.432]  It's really high-quality food.
[01:54:58.452 --> 01:55:00.913]  It's freeze-dried, so it's condensed.
[01:55:01.253 --> 01:55:04.174]  I mean, it fits in very small areas, massive amounts of food.
[01:55:05.490 --> 01:55:06.992]  And that's what I got in my attic.
[01:55:07.593 --> 01:55:13.059]  I got two years' supply for one person, so that's enough for my family for about six, eight months.
[01:55:13.519 --> 01:55:14.160]  I need to get more.
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:18.145]  I'm just so busy fighting the New World Order, swinging my musket that I don't ever fiddle with this stuff.
[01:55:19.046 --> 01:55:23.411]  That's what I hate doing, spending my time on taxes and bills and all this stuff.
[01:55:23.491 --> 01:55:25.753]  I'd rather just fight the New World Order, but hey, what do you do?
[01:55:27.132 --> 01:55:27.693]  Give them a call.
[01:55:27.733 --> 01:55:28.173]  Don't wait.
[01:55:28.213 --> 01:55:29.174]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:55:29.314 --> 01:55:32.977]  Get an insurance policy you can eat.
[01:55:32.997 --> 01:55:33.537]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:55:33.557 --> 01:55:37.100]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodscorrect.com.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.401]  They really are fabulous folks.
[01:55:38.501 --> 01:55:40.283]  You need to get a store of food in.
[01:55:40.303 --> 01:55:44.306]  It lasts 10 years and it's a great insurance policy for whatever comes down the road.
[01:55:44.326 --> 01:55:47.809]  800-409-5633 or efoodscorrect.com.
[01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:49.070]  Huge banners on the top.
[01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:51.992]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:55:53.073 --> 01:55:56.376]  And continuing here, it's a big part of the solution.
[01:55:57.635 --> 01:56:00.417]  I have made 18 films.
[01:56:02.638 --> 01:56:03.478]  Or is it 17?
[01:56:03.559 --> 01:56:04.319]  I forget.
[01:56:04.359 --> 01:56:05.600]  There's two editions of Terrorist Worms.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:06.380]  I count that as two.
[01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:07.661]  So I guess it's 18 with that.
[01:56:08.481 --> 01:56:10.382]  But Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, it's out.
[01:56:10.422 --> 01:56:11.023]  It's excellent.
[01:56:11.103 --> 01:56:15.025]  Global Master Plan, NAU documented, the eugenics, all of it.
[01:56:15.045 --> 01:56:16.166]  I mean, it's an incredible film.
[01:56:16.286 --> 01:56:21.569]  I would think you'd want to have the DVD and then put more fuel in our gas tank to attack savagely the enemy.
[01:56:22.563 --> 01:56:23.823]  That's literally what we do here.
[01:56:24.244 --> 01:56:26.924]  And we've got Loose Change Final Cut available for you.
[01:56:26.944 --> 01:56:28.325]  You can get it discounted with in-game.
[01:56:28.625 --> 01:56:30.986]  When you get in-game, you can get in-game discounted when you get it with it.
[01:56:31.666 --> 01:56:34.907]  That's all at InfoWars.com with a bunch of other books and videos.
[01:56:34.927 --> 01:56:38.648]  The best stuff we've found out there at DiscountedPricesAtInfoWars.com.
[01:56:38.728 --> 01:56:42.869]  You can link to it at the Secure Online Shopping Cart or at TruthNews.us.
[01:56:43.069 --> 01:56:45.030]  They've got links to it over there too.
[01:56:45.050 --> 01:56:45.710]  Curt Nemo does.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:50.182]  Or get a five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:50.222 --> 01:56:50.823]  Download them all.
[01:56:50.883 --> 01:56:52.343]  It's super high quality right now.
[01:56:52.443 --> 01:56:54.344]  It is an armory waiting for you.
[01:56:54.384 --> 01:56:56.286]  I mean, you can go there, get a membership, 50 cents a day.
[01:56:57.046 --> 01:57:00.528]  You can go there and you can just start burning them to disk, downloading them and giving them to people.
[01:57:01.068 --> 01:57:09.393]  Whatever TV show you like, whatever issue I cover, whatever radio show, whatever film, my book, Paul Watson's book, put copies of them on disk, print copies of them out, run around and throw them in the air.
[01:57:10.253 --> 01:57:15.517]  I don't know, throw them in the air, fire shotguns at them, use them for placemats, birdcage liner, whatever you want.
[01:57:15.557 --> 01:57:16.557]  I mean, just go wild.
[01:57:17.298 --> 01:57:22.502]  Just start making thousands of copies of the films off the website, run around thumbing it to mouth, giving it to everyone.
[01:57:22.522 --> 01:57:23.662]  That's going to get the job done.
[01:57:23.702 --> 01:57:30.147]  I mean, just putting your weight right up against the New World Order and saying, you know what, I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm going to go ahead and give you a run for your money.
[01:57:30.347 --> 01:57:31.588]  Let's get it on!
[01:57:31.608 --> 01:57:32.789]  Thank you for listening to GCS.
[01:57:38.693 --> 01:57:40.914]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.319 --> 01:57:51.000]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:52.720]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.401 --> 01:57:54.561]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.581 --> 01:57:56.022]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.723 --> 01:57:58.664]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.684 --> 01:58:02.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.466 --> 01:58:06.548]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.637 --> 01:58:12.219]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:58:12.239 --> 01:58:17.083]  We've got Mike Adams coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:18.684 --> 01:58:27.912]  Here's a little compilation from the 10-minute news report he did on the great HPV hoax, the live cancer virus hoax.
[01:58:27.992 --> 01:58:28.572]  Here it is.
[01:58:29.673 --> 01:58:35.318]  And what if everything you've been told about Gardasil and the HPV vaccines was a lie?
[01:58:35.862 --> 01:58:39.745]  What if it wasn't even true that HPV causes cervical cancer?
[01:58:40.186 --> 01:58:46.792]  What if the FDA knew years ago that HPV infections don't cause cancer, but they covered it up?
[01:58:47.272 --> 01:58:48.573]  Refuse to tell people about it?
[01:58:48.914 --> 01:59:01.205]  What if Gardasil was just pushed by pseudoscientific nonsense, complete junk science, and not only was useless in preventing cervical cancer, but was also potentially harmful to young women?
[01:59:02.245 --> 01:59:11.129]  Most women who become infected with HPV are able to eradicate the virus and suffer no apparent long-term consequences to their health.
[01:59:11.669 --> 01:59:16.131]  And that means eradicate it on their own, without intervention, without a vaccine.
[01:59:16.271 --> 01:59:20.172]  It means that HPV infections are self-limiting.
[01:59:21.353 --> 01:59:27.135]  The same press release also says that although the rate of HPV infection in this group is high,
[01:59:27.734 --> 01:59:33.099]  Most infections are short-lived and not associated with cervical cancer.
[01:59:34.139 --> 01:59:34.700]  You got that?
[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.822]  Not associated with cervical cancer.
[01:59:36.842 --> 01:59:38.183]  It's right here on the press release.
[01:59:39.023 --> 01:59:40.545]  These people are crazy!
[01:59:40.985 --> 01:59:43.067]  They just try to promote these drugs for anything.
[01:59:43.127 --> 01:59:52.835]  It's classic fear-mongering and classic disease-mongering for the sole purpose of selling more expensive pharmaceuticals and vaccines to people who don't need them.
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:59.062]  Yeah, I've been watching the stuff he does over at NewsTarget.
[01:59:59.142 --> 02:00:02.843]  Great website that we link to and repost some of their great stuff.
[02:00:03.223 --> 02:00:04.364]  NewsTarget.com.
[02:00:05.204 --> 02:00:06.525]  He's also got the Health Ranger.
[02:00:06.985 --> 02:00:08.446]  Mike Adams coming in the next segment.
[02:00:12.247 --> 02:00:13.288]  They call him the Health Ranger.
[02:00:13.348 --> 02:00:18.610]  He says he used to be chronically diseased with borderline obesity, diabetes, depression, severe back pain.
[02:00:18.630 --> 02:00:21.471]  He used to visit doctors and follow their advice.
[02:00:22.011 --> 02:00:23.272]  He used to eat anything he wanted to.
[02:00:24.622 --> 02:00:26.883]  So does pizza, donuts, milk, hamburgers, you name it.
[02:00:27.383 --> 02:00:31.205]  And now he's in great shape and doesn't have diabetes anymore and is just fine.
[02:00:31.225 --> 02:00:32.545]  Like so many others.
[02:00:32.565 --> 02:00:34.866]  Me, I've gotten out of shape fighting the New World Order.
[02:00:34.886 --> 02:00:36.187]  I'm just now trying to get back into it.
[02:00:36.207 --> 02:00:38.248]  Because you can't ignore the two.
[02:00:39.128 --> 02:00:41.789]  But he does a lot of great research and his writers do too.
[02:00:41.809 --> 02:00:43.130]  And I notice it's spot on.
[02:00:43.874 --> 02:00:44.454]  We're good to go.
[02:01:09.045 --> 02:01:16.429]  Sometimes I get into my rant mode for a full hour, pretty much, or 30 minutes, and then never even get back into your calls in the news.
[02:01:17.229 --> 02:01:21.891]  Because, again, I burn with desire to want to be able to warn you about each and every one of these things.
[02:01:22.312 --> 02:01:29.195]  Because I've got years and years of research, now about 15 years of research, 13 years on air, and I've interviewed so many experts.
[02:01:29.235 --> 02:01:31.036]  I do this for a living, so I stay focused on it.
[02:01:31.836 --> 02:01:35.978]  And then now the connections, the info, the knowledge, and I'm not really good at even presenting it.
[02:01:36.018 --> 02:01:36.979]  I just have the info.
[02:01:38.161 --> 02:01:46.984]  And to know the psychology they're using, and the programs they're using, and to know that they knowingly understand these drugs are going to kill you, maim you, give you new diseases they've got drugs for.
[02:01:47.224 --> 02:01:48.324]  The doctors don't know that.
[02:01:48.365 --> 02:01:50.765]  They're compartmentalized how that whole structure works.
[02:01:52.526 --> 02:02:04.490]  It's the complexity of the world allows these corporate elites who built and designed the very mainframe, the very scaffolding, the very blueprint, the very skeletal structure, that that's how they're able to maintain and
[02:02:05.538 --> 02:02:11.545]  Control this whole sophistry, this whole facade, this colossal mountain of fraud.
[02:02:12.786 --> 02:02:14.048]  And it is a predatory system.
[02:02:14.088 --> 02:02:15.049]  Humans are predators.
[02:02:15.749 --> 02:02:23.358]  And so we got a predator class of Homo sapien sapien, or Homo sapien sapien Illuminatus, as the New World Order calls themselves.
[02:02:24.296 --> 02:02:26.717]  And, uh, they literally feed on us.
[02:02:26.937 --> 02:02:29.338]  Soylent green, it's made out of people!
[02:02:29.538 --> 02:02:31.139]  You gotta tell them, Hatcher!
[02:02:31.539 --> 02:02:33.360]  Soon they're gonna be breeding us!
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:34.840]  You gotta tell them!
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:36.961]  WARN EVERYBODY!
[02:02:37.541 --> 02:02:40.362]  SOYLENT GREEN'S MADE OUT OF PEOPLE!
[02:02:40.622 --> 02:02:43.904]  That's a good baseline analogy of what we face.
[02:02:44.164 --> 02:02:44.804]  Stay with us!
[02:02:46.385 --> 02:02:47.805]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:48.886 --> 02:02:49.866]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.626 --> 02:02:54.887]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.527 --> 02:02:57.648]  It's known as the Builder Bird Group.
[02:02:58.328 --> 02:03:00.589]  Don't their objectives mean world domination?
[02:03:01.129 --> 02:03:03.570]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:11.612]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:19.616]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.097 --> 02:03:23.339]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.359 --> 02:03:26.481]  The Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:26.541 --> 02:03:27.682]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.702 --> 02:03:28.462]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.482 --> 02:03:29.603]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.783 --> 02:03:30.644]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.744 --> 02:03:31.644]  That's what they're after.

[02:03:53.816 --> 02:03:56.977]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:46.100]  Attention!
[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:49.041]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:04:49.321 --> 02:04:53.643]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:04:53.943 --> 02:04:54.643]  Listen closely.
[02:04:55.284 --> 02:05:02.766]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:05:03.047 --> 02:05:11.790]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:12.570]  Yeah.
[02:05:29.949 --> 02:05:30.289]  That's right.
[02:05:46.747 --> 02:05:48.949]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.509 --> 02:05:52.372]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.595 --> 02:06:02.440]  Basically what modern health care does is the same thing that scam auto repair people would do in the past and still do.
[02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:08.445]  A lot of them have been caught on video doing this in investigative reports.
[02:06:08.465 --> 02:06:09.866]  You come in to have your car fixed,
[02:06:10.917 --> 02:06:14.462]  And, uh, they replace it with a part they know is going to break in a month.
[02:06:14.903 --> 02:06:17.807]  They unscrew something else they know is going to break in two, three weeks.
[02:06:19.309 --> 02:06:23.214]  And they just cold-bloodedly do it, knowing you're going to continue to come back into them.
[02:06:25.176 --> 02:06:28.381]  And, uh, remember years ago Sears got caught doing stuff like that?
[02:06:29.749 --> 02:06:31.671]  These people don't play games, okay?
[02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:35.675]  And again, the American Medical Association and others stay over the doctors.
[02:06:36.235 --> 02:06:38.598]  You can have a great doctor who has a specialty in a certain area.
[02:06:38.638 --> 02:06:42.721]  They still just believe the peer-reviewed reports and the things that come down, what gets approved.
[02:06:42.781 --> 02:06:45.064]  And others are just lazy, want to go play golf.
[02:06:45.524 --> 02:06:47.165]  They're just told to throw drugs at people.
[02:06:47.226 --> 02:06:48.307]  The public wants the drugs.
[02:06:48.347 --> 02:06:52.150]  I mean, sometimes I watch the news and like half of it or more.
[02:06:52.631 --> 02:06:54.112]  I've seen some newscasts where it's more than half.
[02:06:54.152 --> 02:06:55.173]  It's usually about half.
[02:06:55.922 --> 02:06:56.783]  We're good to go.
[02:07:10.911 --> 02:07:19.253]  Or, oh, you feel restless at night and can't sleep because you probably need to go out and exercise because you're meant to, you know, walk ten miles a day as this type of herbivore you are.
[02:07:19.913 --> 02:07:20.774]  But that doesn't matter.
[02:07:20.794 --> 02:07:25.695]  How about you just take a drug that will make you be a compulsive gambler and a sex addict and make you have psychotic breaks.
[02:07:25.895 --> 02:07:27.255]  But don't worry, we have drugs for that.
[02:07:27.275 --> 02:07:30.016]  I mean, you couldn't make this up.
[02:07:30.196 --> 02:07:37.618]  And just as our guest, the Health Ranger, who is the news editor of NewsTarget, an absolutely fabulous website, newstarget.com,
[02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:54.128]  Uh, again, I like it when I find people, just because I study this all the time, not that I've got all the answers, but it's always, there's only, I don't know, 20, 30 sites and people out there I know of that on certain issues that I find who have done the same research, come up with the same analysis, separate from me,
[02:07:54.981 --> 02:08:00.365]  That lets me know they've really done their homework, and he's learned even more, obviously, about the HPV than I have on a lot of other subjects.
[02:08:00.766 --> 02:08:03.348]  And so we're really excited about having Mike Adams on.
[02:08:03.368 --> 02:08:08.752]  And whenever I talk about people having the same analysis, that means it's the truth.
[02:08:09.212 --> 02:08:10.533]  We're coming up with the same data.
[02:08:10.593 --> 02:08:11.294]  It's their data.
[02:08:12.048 --> 02:08:19.918]  You know, when you meet somebody who can tell the same story you can, you know, when the police see that, you know, they know they've got something that's credible and accurate.
[02:08:20.139 --> 02:08:21.140]  Well, it's the same thing here.
[02:08:21.981 --> 02:08:25.145]  But instead of babbling, we'll go to our guest, Mike Adams.
[02:08:25.446 --> 02:08:26.847]  Mike, it's great to have you on with us.
[02:08:26.868 --> 02:08:28.770]  Alex, it's great to be here.
[02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:29.391]  It's a real pleasure.
[02:08:30.484 --> 02:08:38.191]  Just in a nutshell, tell us a little bit about yourself and get into some of the things you work on and kind of your awakening, because it's good to see that journey for everybody else out there.
[02:08:38.211 --> 02:08:41.894]  Hopefully they can emulate what you and others have done, especially in the health area.
[02:08:42.174 --> 02:08:45.057]  And then let's get into HPV, because like you said, it's crazy!
[02:08:45.497 --> 02:08:50.361]  It covers 7H strains, which they admit aren't even really associated with this thing.
[02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:53.964]  It only kills a few thousand people a year, which is very low.
[02:08:53.984 --> 02:08:55.946]  You've got millions dying from cancer and stuff.
[02:08:57.507 --> 02:09:05.690]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:11.373]  I mean, we live under what I call a medical dictatorship right now, and I really like your introduction.
[02:09:11.393 --> 02:09:12.873]  You're right on the mark with it.
[02:09:13.313 --> 02:09:21.157]  Basically, these drug companies, they want to turn every single person in this country into a revenue stream, and they don't care who it harms.
[02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:23.331]  They don't care how many people die from it.
[02:09:23.511 --> 02:09:31.888]  They don't care what kind of fraud they have to perpetrate, or price fixing, or scientific fraud, or bribing scientists, bribing doctors, kickback schemes, you name it!
[02:09:32.409 --> 02:09:33.111]  They're all doing it!
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:35.761]  And the victims, of course, are the people.
[02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:44.463]  The people who are honestly trying to get some good health care, trying to be healthier, but they're being lied to by conventional medicine, or what I call ConMed.
[02:09:44.943 --> 02:09:50.585]  They're being lied to by the mainstream media that is, of course, funded by conventional medicine.
[02:09:50.905 --> 02:09:55.247]  You were right when you said those peer-reviewed medical journals, they're filled with drug ads.
[02:09:55.907 --> 02:10:00.768]  I mean, that's what makes this economy move in the health care system.
[02:10:00.828 --> 02:10:01.889]  It's all about drug money.
[02:10:03.653 --> 02:10:07.775]  In terms of my own personal history, real quickly, I used to be diseased, I used to be unhealthy.
[02:10:08.396 --> 02:10:10.077]  I realized my doctors weren't helping me.
[02:10:10.597 --> 02:10:13.458]  All those drugs I was taking, the pharmaceuticals, they weren't helping either.
[02:10:13.478 --> 02:10:15.880]  So I turned things around.
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:20.722]  I just decided to educate myself, do the research, and make some changes.
[02:10:20.762 --> 02:10:25.865]  And that has then become Newstired.com, just sharing that information with other people out there.
[02:10:26.305 --> 02:10:27.866]  So that's where it all comes from, Alex.
[02:10:30.029 --> 02:10:36.012]  Expanding on that, and I use this example a lot because it's one people have actually heard about it, got some attention the last three years.
[02:10:37.392 --> 02:10:40.513]  Bayer Pharmaceutical, globally, the U.S.
[02:10:40.533 --> 02:10:59.001]  to Australia, knowingly took blood that they knew had HIV and three different strains of hepatitis and more, knowingly mixed thousands of, you know, containers of it in together in each batch for factor A, and the documents came out, it's even been on MSNBC, and they knew it was going to kill,
[02:10:59.790 --> 02:11:01.431]  Conservatively, hundreds of thousands.
[02:11:02.011 --> 02:11:08.015]  They shipped it out, and it did, and only France arrested Bayer executives there, thank God.
[02:11:08.916 --> 02:11:11.497]  But that's it, and that was just a subsidiary.
[02:11:12.158 --> 02:11:17.121]  Again, imagine cold-bloodedly, and they got the documents and the lawsuits, knowing you were going to ship it out.
[02:11:17.882 --> 02:11:20.523]  I mean, just, folks, that's the soullessness.
[02:11:21.244 --> 02:11:21.844]  Take Merck.
[02:11:21.864 --> 02:11:27.828]  You know, more recalled vaccines, the drugs that make people have heart attacks, for
[02:11:28.789 --> 02:11:29.530]  Arthritis.
[02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:32.772]  I mean, don't forget any of this stuff.
[02:11:32.832 --> 02:11:34.133]  Now they're behind the HPV.
[02:11:34.173 --> 02:11:34.833]  Please continue.
[02:11:35.614 --> 02:11:41.357]  Yeah, on HPV, their aim, of course, is to sell drugs basically to people who don't need them.
[02:11:42.158 --> 02:11:48.882]  And they realize that, you know, young girls are a target market that they can target with their drugs, with vaccines.
[02:11:49.303 --> 02:11:52.505]  And the way they sell this is they first create fear.
[02:11:53.163 --> 02:11:53.363]  Right?
[02:11:53.863 --> 02:11:57.764]  All the power centers in this country are really good at marketing with fear.
[02:11:58.244 --> 02:12:00.664]  They've mastered that dark art, right?
[02:12:01.224 --> 02:12:07.545]  And they market with fear by first telling people that this virus causes cervical cancer, which is a lie!
[02:12:08.266 --> 02:12:12.846]  Even the research from the maker of the vaccine shows that it doesn't cause cancer.
[02:12:13.487 --> 02:12:19.067]  And this is what I revealed in some of my research on the website, that even the FDA admitted, well, you know what?
[02:12:19.167 --> 02:12:21.908]  The presence of this virus does not cause cervical cancer.
[02:12:23.394 --> 02:12:30.344]  But if they can get people to believe that, then they know they can get people to not only buy the vaccine, but here's what's more important.
[02:12:30.364 --> 02:12:31.946]  Here's where your freedom is being stripped away.
[02:12:32.387 --> 02:12:34.269]  They can get people to mandate it.
[02:12:34.690 --> 02:12:37.494]  If they get a governor of a state like New Jersey,
[02:12:38.143 --> 02:12:43.486]  To mandate this virus, or Maryland, then they can invoke firearms.
[02:12:43.546 --> 02:12:44.847]  They can bring out law enforcement.
[02:12:45.007 --> 02:12:52.451]  By the way, that's a whole new area of this, because this is a new class of vaccines, the live virus vaccines.
[02:12:53.491 --> 02:12:56.373]  So they can set the precedent there, and it's also color of law.
[02:12:56.833 --> 02:12:57.874]  There is no law
[02:12:58.766 --> 02:13:10.151]  But tell that to the kids, literally, with police dogs and cops with guns, who believe it's the law, as they march in and take the shots, but notice the judge quietly says, by the way, you're not forced to do this, after they're injected.
[02:13:10.532 --> 02:13:11.792]  Right, right, exactly.
[02:13:11.812 --> 02:13:17.435]  Which again, shows the total criminality, and these are drug companies that will knowingly inject you with AIDS.
[02:13:17.475 --> 02:13:17.795]  Go ahead.
[02:13:18.415 --> 02:13:19.856]  Well, I call it gunpoint medicine.
[02:13:20.536 --> 02:13:21.536]  And you're exactly right.
[02:13:21.576 --> 02:13:26.738]  They actually have police officers armed people with attack dogs there rounding up children.
[02:13:26.778 --> 02:13:29.658]  This is what happened in Maryland just a few weeks ago.
[02:13:30.279 --> 02:13:35.980]  And they were corralling people into the courtroom where the judge would oversee their children being injected.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:37.601]  And here's the threat.
[02:13:37.921 --> 02:13:41.982]  The threat by the state is that if you don't agree with their medicine,
[02:13:42.466 --> 02:13:56.574]  If you don't agree to have your children injected with these toxic substances, which can include methylmercury and many other dangerous things, then they're going to kidnap your children, essentially, by having Child Protective Services take them away, and they're going to imprison you and take away your rights.
[02:13:56.814 --> 02:13:57.654]  And here's the deal.
[02:13:57.754 --> 02:13:59.535]  Everything he's saying is already happening.
[02:13:59.595 --> 02:14:08.000]  We have been incrementally brought into this, and Mike, I've noticed that you're really focused on the medical yourself at a higher level than I am even.
[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:11.942]  Are you seeing a massive acceleration of every one of their programs?
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:14.321]  Oh yeah, there's no question about it.
[02:14:15.161 --> 02:14:18.862]  Where they're going with this, Alex, is they're going to combine this with the RFID chips.
[02:14:19.263 --> 02:14:27.846]  They're going to microchip everybody so that when you walk through any kind of government building or even airport security, they're going to scan your medical chip.
[02:14:28.446 --> 02:14:30.128]  And see whether or not you're vaccinated.
[02:14:30.168 --> 02:14:31.950]  And if you're not, you could be arrested.
[02:14:32.091 --> 02:14:34.974]  And that's why they're running all these reports about TB and the planes.
[02:14:34.994 --> 02:14:36.155]  They look at the borders wide open.
[02:14:36.175 --> 02:14:37.317]  They could care less about that.
[02:14:37.557 --> 02:14:38.818]  They're introducing the idea.
[02:14:38.999 --> 02:14:45.887]  And the military, the Pentagon and Homeland Security and Tommy Thompson have all said the plan is to make you take a chip.
[02:14:46.587 --> 02:14:47.448]  It's exactly what it is.
[02:14:47.768 --> 02:14:50.229]  They're going to microchip everyone, and you know who they're targeting first?
[02:14:50.650 --> 02:14:52.951]  The people who are least able to defend themselves.
[02:14:53.011 --> 02:14:54.252]  The Alzheimer's patients.
[02:14:54.732 --> 02:14:57.474]  Elderly people with dementia who cannot defend themselves.
[02:14:57.754 --> 02:14:59.215]  That's who they're microchipping first.
[02:14:59.895 --> 02:15:04.998]  And once that's accepted, then they're going to start mandating the microchipping of children.
[02:15:05.739 --> 02:15:08.100]  And once that's accepted, it's going to be everyone.
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:12.723]  They're going to mandate vaccines and even potentially psychotropic drugs
[02:15:13.263 --> 02:15:19.127]  For all kinds of people, and they define who it is, and then it works with the firearms who enforce it, if you disagree.
[02:15:19.147 --> 02:15:22.050]  So your freedoms in healthcare are gone.
[02:15:23.331 --> 02:15:29.415]  I mean... And how are we supposed to free society when they're... And police and others can't deny this is happening.
[02:15:29.615 --> 02:15:34.939]  They know there's no law to take shots, but they still say it is, and they take kids every day for not taking them.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.181]  No, well, you're right.
[02:15:37.761 --> 02:15:41.444]  People think, well, we have a free society and we're defending freedom, but if you look around,
[02:15:42.256 --> 02:15:45.538]  And your listeners are very well informed on this subject, of course.
[02:15:45.878 --> 02:15:48.840]  But if you look around, you realize we don't live in a free society.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:55.885]  We don't even have the freedom to tell the truth about the healing power of an herb or a nutritional supplement in this country.
[02:15:56.505 --> 02:16:04.610]  That right to free speech, scientifically accurate free speech, has been censored by the oppressive Food and Drug Administration.
[02:16:05.206 --> 02:16:19.275]  You can't even, if you grow cherries, and you say this cherry helps reduce arthritis inflammation, which over a dozen scientific studies say it does, then the FDA can shut down your business and have you arrested and raid your inventory at gunpoint.
[02:16:19.895 --> 02:16:21.877]  And they've done that many times in the past.
[02:16:21.977 --> 02:16:24.458]  I've documented it.
[02:16:24.538 --> 02:16:24.918]  Absolutely.
[02:16:25.038 --> 02:16:25.759]  Please continue.
[02:16:26.716 --> 02:16:29.378]  Well, I mean, that's the kind of society that we really live in today.
[02:16:30.079 --> 02:16:35.024]  It's a monopoly on medicine, and it's a monopoly on medical information.
[02:16:35.484 --> 02:16:38.507]  It's designed to limit consumers' choices.
[02:16:38.967 --> 02:16:40.208]  This is like with the election.
[02:16:40.709 --> 02:16:44.112]  They don't want Ron Paul to even have a shot at winning.
[02:16:44.572 --> 02:16:47.795]  They want to kick him out of the process of these debates.
[02:16:48.476 --> 02:16:49.396]  Same thing with medicine.
[02:16:50.609 --> 02:16:51.209]  I think so.
[02:17:06.201 --> 02:17:08.542]  I mean, this is our so-called free country.
[02:17:08.562 --> 02:17:08.922]  It's simple.
[02:17:09.123 --> 02:17:10.363]  It's all about monopolies.
[02:17:10.403 --> 02:17:19.908]  If the big international banks and the corporations they own can set the precedent through this infrastructure, and it's the same laws from New Zealand to Canada to Germany to the U.S.
[02:17:19.928 --> 02:17:28.513]  to Mexico, they come in and lobby legislatures to put the same system in to make you come under their control, knowing it's going to make you shicker so they can then come in with more control.
[02:17:29.153 --> 02:17:38.618]  I've got to get you a copy of my film, Endgame, Mike, because it gets into the eugenics, and you're such a well-versed guy, I would imagine you probably know, but I want to get your take on, do you know the master plan?
[02:17:38.638 --> 02:17:39.638]  Because I'm not aware of you do.
[02:17:39.658 --> 02:17:42.920]  I want to ask you if you know where all this is leading when we get back.
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:45.101]  Mike Adams, he heads up News Target.
[02:17:45.121 --> 02:17:45.701]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:49.723 --> 02:17:50.763]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:17:50.783 --> 02:17:54.225]  I want to tell you about our plans at Genesis to take Ron Paul Revolution to the air.
[02:17:54.949 --> 02:18:00.373]  The Ron Paul Air Corps plans to put 100 banner flights above the American cities to get the message out about Ron Paul.
[02:18:01.334 --> 02:18:06.178]  By the end of December, we plan to be ready to fly in Iowa and have 50 cities covered by February 5th.
[02:18:07.139 --> 02:18:09.340]  In order to accomplish this project, we need your help.
[02:18:10.621 --> 02:18:13.464]  Come to RonPaulAirCorps.com and make a contribution.
[02:18:14.364 --> 02:18:18.748]  It costs approximately $400 per hour to fly, so we need your generous support.
[02:18:19.963 --> 02:18:22.706]  Please consider donating to the RonPaulAirCorp.com.
[02:18:23.346 --> 02:18:28.612]  As the ground troops canvass the neighborhoods, we plan to provide air support drawing as much media as possible.
[02:18:29.693 --> 02:18:32.556]  Come to RonPaulAirCorp.com and make a contribution.
[02:18:33.797 --> 02:18:40.964]  That's RonPaulAIRCORPS.com Here's to freedom, the Constitution, and liberty.

[02:18:46.147 --> 02:18:51.791]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:18:51.991 --> 02:18:57.135]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:18:57.415 --> 02:19:02.499]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:19:02.799 --> 02:19:06.362]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[02:19:06.642 --> 02:19:08.383]  Mental clarity and loss of weight.
[02:19:08.683 --> 02:19:14.686]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[02:19:14.926 --> 02:19:18.447]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:19:18.707 --> 02:19:23.249]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:19:23.529 --> 02:19:24.310]  Do your part.
[02:19:24.570 --> 02:19:26.831]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!

[02:20:39.781 --> 02:20:40.943]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:45.882 --> 02:20:47.723]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:47.863 --> 02:20:53.024]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:53.205 --> 02:20:54.545]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:54.825 --> 02:21:02.988]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:21:03.208 --> 02:21:08.930]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:10.892]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:21:10.952 --> 02:21:13.115]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:21:13.255 --> 02:21:17.521]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:21:17.681 --> 02:21:19.804]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:21:19.904 --> 02:21:27.073]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:21:29.187 --> 02:21:29.748]  We're good to go.
[02:21:55.044 --> 02:22:00.489]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[02:22:00.509 --> 02:22:05.914]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[02:22:05.934 --> 02:22:08.636]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[02:22:08.676 --> 02:22:11.058]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[02:22:11.138 --> 02:22:16.363]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[02:22:19.245 --> 02:22:40.815]  We looked down the river and we seen the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drums They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton mills and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more as they began to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[02:22:46.628 --> 02:22:52.833]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen, with the guy that heads up NewsTarget.com.
[02:22:52.853 --> 02:22:53.994]  He's the editor there.
[02:22:54.034 --> 02:22:54.774]  He's Mike Adams.
[02:22:54.834 --> 02:22:59.898]  In the last year or so, I've been reading his stuff and watching some of the videos he's been doing lately on YouTube.
[02:23:00.479 --> 02:23:01.139]  Very good stuff.
[02:23:02.529 --> 02:23:05.292]  I mean, I shouldn't say, do you know the answer to the master plan?
[02:23:05.312 --> 02:23:07.574]  I should say, what's your take and your view?
[02:23:07.594 --> 02:23:10.576]  And I just wanted to see if you were aware of some of the things I was.
[02:23:10.596 --> 02:23:18.864]  I'm sure you are, but I just want your unique perspective on where you see all this leading, or have you gotten the idea that it's not just about greed?
[02:23:19.805 --> 02:23:22.968]  Well, Alex, I've been following your material for many years, too.
[02:23:23.048 --> 02:23:27.872]  I mean, you're one of the writers that I recommend, and so I am familiar with a lot of your material.
[02:23:29.551 --> 02:23:32.715]  The HPV vaccine and where they're going with that to the big picture.
[02:23:33.455 --> 02:23:34.436]  Take this statistic.
[02:23:35.738 --> 02:23:45.989]  Those who are already exposed to this human papillomavirus who get the vaccine, they have an increased risk of cervical cancer.
[02:23:46.169 --> 02:23:47.030]  A risk of 44.6% higher
[02:23:50.111 --> 02:23:54.655]  And I've read their own literature, their own inserts, admit that it, A, doesn't protect you from cancer.
[02:23:54.675 --> 02:23:55.656]  The 300 plus known strains of this
[02:24:18.633 --> 02:24:19.094]  We're good to go!
[02:24:40.072 --> 02:24:40.252]  I think?
[02:25:10.252 --> 02:25:11.093]  This is incredible!
[02:25:11.553 --> 02:25:17.136]  Well, what the drug companies want to do is they want to lead you from one disease to the next that they can treat.
[02:25:17.316 --> 02:25:22.179]  For example, if you go into a doctor and you say you're depressed, they might give you an antidepressant drug.
[02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:26.242]  Well, they don't tell you that those antidepressants often cause diabetes.
[02:25:26.954 --> 02:25:29.876]  Once you've got diabetes, then you're a really lucrative customer.
[02:25:30.296 --> 02:25:35.019]  Now you might be worth as much as half a million dollars over your lifetime to that drug company.
[02:25:35.339 --> 02:25:38.941]  And they don't tell you that those diabetes drugs you're taking cause liver damage.
[02:25:39.381 --> 02:25:41.963]  Now they've got you for liver damage and more drugs.
[02:25:42.403 --> 02:25:48.787]  And by the way, when you die someday, bankrupt, and your liver is gone, the cause of death will be natural causes.
[02:25:49.267 --> 02:25:51.328]  They won't list, you were killed by pharmaceuticals.
[02:25:51.644 --> 02:25:57.092]  Well, it's the same thing they do with inflation, saying it's 2% when the mainline banks say it's at 15%.
[02:25:58.014 --> 02:26:02.761]  Or once you go off the unemployment rolls, they count you as employed and say unemployment's at 4%.
[02:26:04.103 --> 02:26:06.447]  They crook the medical numbers and that's been admitted.
[02:26:07.207 --> 02:26:07.708]  Yeah, they do.
[02:26:07.728 --> 02:26:09.769]  There's so much fraud that goes on.
[02:26:09.809 --> 02:26:12.330]  I mean, what's going on is not scientific at all.
[02:26:12.370 --> 02:26:18.194]  They claim it's good, hard science, but in fact, they conduct, let's say, ten studies on a particular drug.
[02:26:18.594 --> 02:26:23.117]  They can decide which four out of those ten that they want the FDA to see.
[02:26:23.357 --> 02:26:29.581]  Well, here's an example they found with aspartame and its approval in the 80s, that in studies paid for by Serum,
[02:26:30.397 --> 02:26:39.205]  That it caused all the monkeys to get brain tumors and then they used that and took it to Congress and the FDA saying it was good data.
[02:26:39.853 --> 02:26:40.633]  Yeah, I know.
[02:26:40.913 --> 02:26:41.193]  They do.
[02:26:41.233 --> 02:26:42.394]  They turn it completely around.
[02:26:42.754 --> 02:26:53.736]  But getting back to the big picture here, that issue, what they really want to do, Alex, is turn every human being into a profit stream, into lifetime revenues.
[02:26:54.116 --> 02:26:57.877]  They don't really want to kill you as quickly as possible.
[02:26:57.917 --> 02:27:05.499]  They sort of want to string you along, empty your pockets, make you what comedian George Carlin calls an obedient worker.
[02:27:07.028 --> 02:27:07.909]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:27:07.969 --> 02:27:13.011]  That's in the western world, where there's still 20% of the glove's wealth left in individual hands.
[02:27:13.592 --> 02:27:17.734]  But in the third world, just like in Goldfinger, do you expect me to talk?
[02:27:17.794 --> 02:27:19.415]  No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die.
[02:27:19.575 --> 02:27:20.475]  My mother corrected me.
[02:27:20.515 --> 02:27:22.056]  It's tipsing Dr. No.
[02:27:22.096 --> 02:27:23.136]  It was Goldfinger.
[02:27:23.156 --> 02:27:24.537]  We had a big argument about it this weekend.
[02:27:25.578 --> 02:27:27.398]  But in the third world, they expect you to die.
[02:27:27.919 --> 02:27:31.781]  And I agree with you that now, in the interim, that is the game plan, but absolutely.
[02:27:32.201 --> 02:27:33.522]  Wow, what an amazing guest.
[02:27:33.542 --> 02:27:34.162]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.565 --> 02:27:39.588]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.489 --> 02:27:43.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.055 --> 02:27:50.160]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:51.681]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[02:27:56.070 --> 02:28:00.493]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[02:28:00.513 --> 02:28:02.955]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[02:28:03.295 --> 02:28:05.457]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[02:28:05.757 --> 02:28:08.659]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:12.762]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[02:28:13.122 --> 02:28:18.506]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[02:28:20.405 --> 02:28:24.949]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[02:28:24.989 --> 02:28:28.592]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:28:29.832 --> 02:28:34.716]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[02:28:34.776 --> 02:28:38.079]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:41.401]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[02:28:41.501 --> 02:28:42.462]  Go to hempusa.org.
[02:28:45.999 --> 02:28:51.504]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:28:51.924 --> 02:28:56.168]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:28:56.589 --> 02:29:03.455]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:29:03.875 --> 02:29:10.582]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:29:10.902 --> 02:29:12.524]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:29:12.824 --> 02:29:16.008]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:29:16.288 --> 02:29:18.751]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[02:29:32.982 --> 02:29:34.763]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:29:46.107 --> 02:29:50.368]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:29:50.628 --> 02:29:55.509]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:29:55.729 --> 02:29:57.050]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:29:57.230 --> 02:30:00.690]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:30:41.373 --> 02:30:41.614]  Hayes.
[02:30:41.714 --> 02:30:41.974]  Ira Hayes.
[02:30:41.994 --> 02:30:42.394]  Ira Hayes.
[02:30:42.414 --> 02:30:42.755]  Ira Hayes.
[02:31:06.244 --> 02:31:12.528]  Call him drunk and by the hand, he won't answer anymore.
[02:31:13.208 --> 02:31:18.371]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the marine that went to war.
[02:31:18.472 --> 02:31:22.374]  Gather round me people, there's a story I would tell.
[02:31:30.157 --> 02:31:34.360]  About a brave young Indian, you should remember well.
[02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:44.847]  From the land of the Pima Indian, a proud and noble band, who farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land.
[02:31:46.608 --> 02:31:56.034]  Down the ditches a thousand years, the waters grew Irish people's crops, till the white men stole their water rights, and the sparkling waters stopped.
[02:31:57.382 --> 02:32:01.824]  Now, Ira's folks were hungry, and their land grew crops of weeds.
[02:32:02.484 --> 02:32:07.225]  When war came, Ira volunteered, and forgot to fight men's greed.
[02:32:07.345 --> 02:32:11.287]  Call him drunk, and Ira pays.
[02:32:11.367 --> 02:32:13.727]  He won't answer anymore.
[02:32:14.288 --> 02:32:21.110]  Not the whiskey-drinking Indian, or the Marine that... Let me tell you how this worked before we go back to your hard gas, and then some phone calls.
[02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:35.951]  You know, people ask me, well, how do I have the Lakota nation on who's trying to secede with their reservations, which is their land, it's their right to get out of this corrupt system where they run eugenics against them, kidnap their children.
[02:32:36.191 --> 02:32:39.554]  That was one of the things they said while they were breaking the treaty was the CPS taking their kids.
[02:32:40.194 --> 02:32:43.017]  And I've looked at the Lakota and the Sioux and others, and they're good folks.
[02:32:44.118 --> 02:32:46.760]  And they know the UN's bad, they understand the New World Order.
[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:47.861]  I've talked to them, I've interviewed them.
[02:32:48.695 --> 02:32:49.856]  So I support what they're doing.
[02:32:49.936 --> 02:32:50.837]  It's not some U.N.
[02:32:50.997 --> 02:32:54.039]  op like the Puerto Ricans out of Mexico saying they control the U.S.
[02:32:54.339 --> 02:32:54.939]  That's a fraud.
[02:32:55.260 --> 02:32:57.201]  Then people ask, well, how can you like Andrew Jackson?
[02:32:57.921 --> 02:32:59.342]  Well, Andrew Jackson fought the British.
[02:32:59.743 --> 02:33:01.124]  He fought in the war.
[02:33:01.144 --> 02:33:01.704]  He was 12 and 13.
[02:33:01.764 --> 02:33:04.406]  His brother and mother died in a concentration camp.
[02:33:05.867 --> 02:33:07.208]  He respected his enemies.
[02:33:08.148 --> 02:33:11.591]  And you have to understand the time and history that they were in as well.
[02:33:12.531 --> 02:33:14.553]  And you're saying, why are you talking about Native Americans?
[02:33:15.878 --> 02:33:23.042]  I was thinking about my friend Kevin Booth we had on a few weeks ago about his new film that's going to be on Showtime, American Drug War.
[02:33:24.223 --> 02:33:25.524]  I was friends with his dad.
[02:33:25.564 --> 02:33:26.665]  His friend was quite a character.
[02:33:26.725 --> 02:33:30.467]  He'd been a director of a pretty good sized corporation.
[02:33:30.767 --> 02:33:35.790]  He'd been retired by the time I knew him about 15 years ago but I'd go out to the ranch sometimes and ride horses and stuff.
[02:33:36.671 --> 02:33:39.673]  And his dad was quite a character, I'll say that.
[02:33:40.053 --> 02:33:48.797]  And one time Kevin told a story about how they were at the Grand Canyon on a road trip when they lived out in California when he was a little kid.
[02:33:49.077 --> 02:33:59.702]  And there was a drunk Indian stumbling around out there and his dad went to him and said, son, you see that?
[02:34:00.382 --> 02:34:04.544]  With a smug, satisfied look, that's why we were able to take third land.
[02:34:05.709 --> 02:34:09.532]  But see, the thing is, is that, and it's not knocking Mr. Booth, it's an interesting story.
[02:34:11.473 --> 02:34:21.541]  The point is, that's just the view, and you've got this attitude in corporate America and globally, but it's not just... You know, used to, whites, though, would feel like they were part of it and in on it and, haha, we're getting them.
[02:34:22.602 --> 02:34:25.784]  But they're doing it to everybody now, and I want to be clear on that.
[02:34:26.485 --> 02:34:31.308]  I'd be against it if they were just doing it to blacks and Mexicans and the rest... The point is, they're doing this to everybody.
[02:34:31.869 --> 02:34:34.791]  So, even if you're out there and a white supremacist, you should be against all this.
[02:34:36.060 --> 02:34:46.250]  And of course, the John Wayne idea wasn't white supremacist style to say, ha ha, the Indians, that was just Americana, and you know, they're the enemy and we're going to fight them.
[02:34:46.270 --> 02:34:47.832]  And now we've seen that attitude change.
[02:34:49.574 --> 02:34:52.477]  But, you know, I mean, I remember being deer hunting when I was a kid.
[02:34:52.517 --> 02:34:54.559]  You wouldn't hear people use the N-word or anything like that.
[02:34:54.919 --> 02:35:01.565]  Not with family, but other deer hunters, you'd hear comments about the Indians or somebody would bring up what happened at Wounded Knee, too, in the 70s and all.
[02:35:02.125 --> 02:35:03.327]  You know, they get what they deserve.
[02:35:03.747 --> 02:35:07.771]  You know, it kind of becomes that us against them mentality.
[02:35:08.831 --> 02:35:14.777]  Folks, even if you're on the board of directors of a company doing, you know, a billion bucks a business a year.
[02:35:16.079 --> 02:35:19.460]  And you make millions of dollars a year and you've got the finest golf course membership.
[02:35:20.541 --> 02:35:22.401]  They're all drinking Diet Cokes.
[02:35:22.421 --> 02:35:24.242]  They're all on the same liver medication.
[02:35:24.702 --> 02:35:27.023]  This system is kind of self-replicating.
[02:35:27.083 --> 02:35:31.665]  It's set up now and it's just eating us all up, even the people that work in the system.
[02:35:32.365 --> 02:35:35.726]  Now, a David Rockefeller or a John D. Rockefeller Jr.
[02:35:35.786 --> 02:35:39.627]  from West Virginia, all they drink is purified water, organic food now.
[02:35:40.148 --> 02:35:41.328]  The elite's getting real upset.
[02:35:41.368 --> 02:35:43.809]  I mean, the very creme de la creme knows the program.
[02:35:45.582 --> 02:35:48.427]  You get the point I'm making, Mike Adams, from Newstarget.com?
[02:35:48.447 --> 02:35:56.720]  I mean, I just told that story there just to try to bring it home to people that a lot of people think they're part of the establishment who aren't.
[02:35:58.095 --> 02:35:59.496]  You're right.
[02:35:59.576 --> 02:36:07.561]  These corporations know that the way to control a so-called democracy is to focus on controlling people's minds.
[02:36:08.081 --> 02:36:11.063]  And the way you do that, in part, is with chemicals.
[02:36:11.103 --> 02:36:12.704]  This is why we have mass fluoridation.
[02:36:13.204 --> 02:36:14.965]  It's to keep people mentally numb.
[02:36:15.385 --> 02:36:19.268]  This is why we have such high prescription rates for psychotropic drugs.
[02:36:19.748 --> 02:36:28.072]  By the way, the Roman Senate had laws, had rules, they made the bigger corporations in grain and wine and construction pay out to the mob free wine certain days a week, free bread.
[02:36:28.112 --> 02:36:32.595]  When bad political stuff would happen, when they would kill certain groups of people, they would hand out more wine, more free silver.
[02:36:48.823 --> 02:36:50.525]  Yeah, yeah, it's interesting to say, Roman.
[02:36:50.565 --> 02:36:52.627]  We really are in an era of bread and circuses right now, aren't we?
[02:36:52.647 --> 02:36:54.510]  I mean, things are accelerating.
[02:37:07.584 --> 02:37:16.648]  And, by the way, I want to mention, I think the most important way that we can defend our freedoms against what's going on right now is to help get Ron Paul elected.
[02:37:17.168 --> 02:37:19.670]  This is why I've really put my support behind Paul.
[02:37:20.310 --> 02:37:25.272]  I mean, he's the only one out there, the only candidate that understands individual liberties, real freedom.
[02:37:26.172 --> 02:37:31.235]  Not synthetic freedom that's talked about by other candidates who are just trying to sell fear and control you.
[02:37:31.255 --> 02:37:35.877]  Ron Paul understands real freedom, and he's the sponsor of the Health Freedom Protection Act.
[02:37:36.910 --> 02:37:42.872]  That would actually allow nutritional supplement companies and herbal companies to tell the truth about what their products do.
[02:37:43.692 --> 02:37:47.414]  And that's another reason why the mainstream media is scared silly of Ron Paul.
[02:37:47.714 --> 02:37:51.875]  They don't want him to help the American people re-establish real freedom.
[02:37:52.035 --> 02:37:53.876]  Have you heard Dr. Dina Dell lately?
[02:37:53.916 --> 02:38:02.499]  I mean, he used to be bad with propaganda, but now every hour he says there's no mercury anymore in vaccines when we all know it's still there and they increased it according to AP.
[02:38:03.239 --> 02:38:05.920]  He says that there's no herbal supplement that's good.
[02:38:06.895 --> 02:38:11.943]  I mean, and he actually talks about how China's good because they're arresting all the vitamin company people.
[02:38:12.404 --> 02:38:15.248]  I mean, that guy, he's gone off, he's gone.
[02:38:15.268 --> 02:38:17.692]  I mean, they must have told him, pull all the stops out.
[02:38:18.214 --> 02:38:23.816]  Yeah, he's obviously lost any touch with reality in making those kinds of statements.
[02:38:23.876 --> 02:38:33.799]  I mean, even the drug companies, they go out to the Amazon and to Chinese medicine and they study those plants to try to synthesize their own isolated chemicals.
[02:38:34.179 --> 02:38:37.880]  But then they claim, well, all those plants are bad for you, only our drugs will work for you.
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:39.360]  You know, it's crazy.
[02:38:40.261 --> 02:38:41.521]  If the public knew the truth,
[02:38:41.954 --> 02:38:43.594]  About how they could reverse cancer.
[02:38:43.614 --> 02:38:45.075]  And yes, I use that word deliberately.
[02:38:45.155 --> 02:38:45.975]  Reverse cancer.
[02:38:46.435 --> 02:38:47.455]  Reverse diabetes.
[02:38:47.775 --> 02:38:52.356]  I'm working with a group here in Arizona having over a 50% cure rate of type 2 diabetes.
[02:38:52.956 --> 02:39:05.078]  I mean, if people knew the truth about what you can do with... Well, Ray Kurzweil, who's a top globalist and very wicked, who calls for one world government and all the rest of it, he reversed his diabetes 100%.
[02:39:05.118 --> 02:39:08.499]  Yeah, it's actually very easy to do.
[02:39:08.599 --> 02:39:10.559]  And he said the same things you're saying with health.
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:11.740]  Right.
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:15.744]  Look, if people knew the truth about this, conventional medicine would collapse.
[02:39:16.264 --> 02:39:20.669]  The cancer industry, which is a multi-billion dollar industry, would collapse.
[02:39:21.089 --> 02:39:23.572]  Here's my question to you, editor of newstarget.com.
[02:39:25.173 --> 02:39:32.140]  Mike, how, and I've looked at the federal numbers, in the 20s and 30s we had 1 in 33 with cancer, getting it, fatal cancer.
[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:33.522]  Now it's 1 in 3.
[02:39:33.922 --> 02:39:34.763]  How did that happen?
[02:39:35.578 --> 02:39:35.978]  Chemicals.
[02:39:36.578 --> 02:39:44.041]  It's through the chemicals in our foods, our personal care products, chemicals we put on our lawns, cleaning our cars, cleaning our homes.
[02:39:44.581 --> 02:39:45.621]  It's the lack of sunlight.
[02:39:45.661 --> 02:39:48.222]  Everyone's sitting under fluorescent lights now all day long.
[02:39:48.242 --> 02:39:51.203]  But there's no call to stop any of that.
[02:39:51.223 --> 02:39:55.884]  There's only calls for a bogus greenhouse gas emission on what plants breathe.
[02:39:56.284 --> 02:39:56.464]  No.
[02:39:56.745 --> 02:39:57.845]  Yeah.
[02:39:58.145 --> 02:40:00.886]  The industry is not focused on preventing disease.
[02:40:00.986 --> 02:40:02.766]  There is no effort to prevent disease.
[02:40:03.026 --> 02:40:04.487]  There's no effort to cure cancer.
[02:40:05.217 --> 02:40:08.218]  There's only an effort to treat it and manage it.
[02:40:08.398 --> 02:40:12.559]  In fact, contrary, they find cancer viruses in every major vaccine class.
[02:40:13.019 --> 02:40:13.219]  Yeah.
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:20.822]  Well, I think vaccines, part of the purpose of vaccines is to indoctrinate people with future diseases.
[02:40:21.542 --> 02:40:22.202]  It's very clear.
[02:40:22.222 --> 02:40:23.722]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:40:23.762 --> 02:40:25.443]  That's why I would never get a vaccine.
[02:40:26.378 --> 02:40:28.239]  Well, let's talk about your personal experience.
[02:40:28.279 --> 02:40:37.785]  I mean, I used to be a health nut, as they say, run six miles a day, live wage two hours a day, totally addicted, and I just kind of, I'm an extreme person, so I just quit working out for about seven years.
[02:40:37.825 --> 02:40:43.009]  Now I've started back off and on the last few years, finally getting back into it, because I can only do it one way or the other.
[02:40:43.829 --> 02:40:44.870]  But, I mean, take you.
[02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:48.032]  I mean, you really got unhealthy, got diabetes, and now look at you.
[02:40:48.052 --> 02:40:49.993]  I mean, talk about your own personal experience.
[02:40:50.433 --> 02:41:06.965]  Well yeah, I used to be diseased and once I started making the shift and getting rid of all the toxic chemicals in my diet, reading labels and learning how food companies actually lie on their food labels, and learning how to avoid those things, like for example, you know they hide MSG in another ingredient called yeast extract.
[02:41:07.839 --> 02:41:17.484]  And they'll make claims on the front of the box, like, oh this is good for your bones, but there's actually an ingredient inside that destroys your bones, like phosphoric acid, which is in soft drinks.
[02:41:17.864 --> 02:41:18.944]  It just eats your bones away.
[02:41:19.305 --> 02:41:20.725]  So I got rid of all those poisons.
[02:41:21.125 --> 02:41:23.927]  I got rid of all the toxic chemicals in my personal care products.
[02:41:24.387 --> 02:41:28.589]  Everything out of my home that was bad for me, and I just started eating nature's medicine.
[02:41:29.341 --> 02:41:31.782]  You know, this is the medicine that we were intended to consume.
[02:41:31.842 --> 02:41:32.843]  Lots of superfoods.
[02:41:33.323 --> 02:41:35.604]  Lots of nutrient-dense nutritional supplements.
[02:41:36.525 --> 02:41:38.466]  And things shifted so quickly.
[02:41:38.486 --> 02:41:39.186]  They turned around.
[02:41:39.726 --> 02:41:45.609]  I mean, mental, physical, emotional, spiritual, all of those areas suddenly operating at a different level.
[02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:49.391]  And people ask me, I'm sure they ask you too, Alex, how do you get so much done?
[02:41:49.411 --> 02:41:51.032]  You know, how do you do all this?
[02:41:51.992 --> 02:41:54.994]  My answer is because I'm taking nature's medicine.
[02:41:56.192 --> 02:41:59.695]  I mean, that's what enables me to perform at this level.
[02:41:59.935 --> 02:42:02.137]  Well, I know this.
[02:42:02.177 --> 02:42:10.024]  I went from being in absolutely fabulous shape, looking like something on a magazine cover, to being kind of a fat blob.
[02:42:12.226 --> 02:42:14.488]  I went from 180 pounds to 260 pounds, and now I'm down to about 240.
[02:42:14.528 --> 02:42:18.972]  I've been talking about it forever, but I've only really been working out the last few months intensely, seven days a week again.
[02:42:22.034 --> 02:42:22.795]  Yes, I do.
[02:42:46.826 --> 02:42:51.907]  Well, there's a huge link between diet and mental function, or what we call cognitive function.
[02:42:52.387 --> 02:42:54.067]  And again, the industries know this.
[02:42:54.147 --> 02:42:56.868]  The food and chemical companies and the government knows this.
[02:42:57.228 --> 02:43:01.669]  And that's why even the USDA food pyramid continues to recommend processed foods.
[02:43:02.089 --> 02:43:11.071]  They know that if they can keep the population eating these processed foods, that they will never have enough mental awareness to start questioning the status quo.
[02:43:11.872 --> 02:43:22.379]  And that's the biggest fear for those in power, is if the people actually start waking up and questioning the status quo and rejecting their drugs, boy, the people in power are in trouble then.
[02:43:22.599 --> 02:43:33.466]  Yeah, that's why the whole police state apparatus is coming in now, and I mean, a big issue I keep pointing out that finally has hit the news, and I don't say that like, ooh, look, I was first to talk about it, I'm horrified.
[02:43:34.264 --> 02:43:42.051]  They've got like 10% of the federal grants to students and scholarships and now in Homeland Security.
[02:43:42.371 --> 02:43:44.693]  We're talking about an army of millions already.
[02:43:45.093 --> 02:43:47.576]  They're engineering a total flip in the economy.
[02:43:47.596 --> 02:43:50.398]  We think it's bad with drugs and CPS and the police.
[02:43:50.979 --> 02:43:52.059]  This is only the beginning.
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:55.703]  I mean, they're setting it up where there's going to be 10 million of these people over us.
[02:43:56.243 --> 02:44:01.848]  Yeah, well, like I said in one of my videos, I think this nation is headed for an economic implosion.
[02:44:02.719 --> 02:44:05.201]  And unless we get somebody like Ron Paul in charge.
[02:44:05.802 --> 02:44:09.725]  And even if he gets in charge, he's facing a huge battle against the other powers.
[02:44:09.745 --> 02:44:14.530]  Well sometimes I worry that if he got in charge, then they're going to implode it even faster and blame it on him.
[02:44:14.690 --> 02:44:15.871]  Oh yeah, I thought the same thing.
[02:44:16.271 --> 02:44:16.852]  Absolutely.
[02:44:17.192 --> 02:44:19.134]  You know what the Fed would do if Ron Paul gets elected?
[02:44:19.614 --> 02:44:25.058]  They'd crash the economy, hyperinflate the currency, and say, look, look what happens when you elect an independent-minded president.
[02:44:25.078 --> 02:44:27.520]  They would instantly stop bailing out all these banks.
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:30.783]  No one would even know what bailing a bank out is, and they'd say Ron Paul did it.
[02:44:31.143 --> 02:44:34.045]  Yep, because the population blames the guy who's there at that moment.
[02:44:34.065 --> 02:44:37.428]  They don't see all the complex events that led up to that moment.
[02:44:37.528 --> 02:44:40.030]  That'd be kind of like a captain pulling into port,
[02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:42.131]  Yeah, that's a great metaphor.
[02:44:42.192 --> 02:44:42.592]  Absolutely right.
[02:44:42.672 --> 02:44:44.513]  So they're doing this with every area they can control.
[02:44:44.533 --> 02:44:45.434]  The media, medicine, politics.
[02:44:56.884 --> 02:44:57.644]  You know, everything.
[02:44:57.664 --> 02:45:01.786]  The Internet is the only thing left that allows regular people to have access.
[02:45:01.826 --> 02:45:16.772]  And now they're coming in where if you have an unencrypted, unscreened, unfiltered Wi-Fi, even out of your house, five years in jail, and we've got to have certified Internet, and only certain parts of the Internet, and Internet 2, they're moving against that right now.
[02:45:17.493 --> 02:45:20.014]  They're coming against this, but I think the genie's out of the bottle.
[02:45:20.054 --> 02:45:20.714]  It's over for them.
[02:45:21.014 --> 02:45:22.535]  Go back, though, to the HPV.
[02:45:23.155 --> 02:45:24.776]  I want you to elaborate more on that.
[02:45:24.916 --> 02:45:33.501]  Forty-five percent increase in cancer risk with cervical cancer when you take the shot.
[02:45:34.562 --> 02:45:36.223]  How do we get that message out to the women?
[02:45:36.903 --> 02:45:39.965]  Okay, well a couple of facts that are really important to realize here.
[02:45:40.506 --> 02:45:46.369]  HPV, of course, is a virus and it can be spread just by casual skin contact, by the way.
[02:45:46.409 --> 02:45:47.730]  That's something a lot of people don't know.
[02:45:48.788 --> 02:45:51.131]  You don't have to be sexually active to acquire this virus.
[02:45:51.171 --> 02:45:53.034]  You can just get it through skin contact.
[02:45:53.254 --> 02:45:55.598]  And it's a virus most people got, folks.
[02:45:55.638 --> 02:45:56.319]  Give me a break.
[02:45:56.359 --> 02:45:57.060]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:59.043]  Almost everyone carries this virus.
[02:45:59.063 --> 02:46:01.427]  You don't see everyone dropping dead of cancer.
[02:46:02.092 --> 02:46:09.439]  So, these groups that are exposed to it, when they're injected, their risk of actually developing cervical cancer goes up.
[02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:10.740]  You might say, why?
[02:46:11.241 --> 02:46:11.962]  Why is that happening?
[02:46:12.382 --> 02:46:20.670]  Well, it's because, of course, there are more viral strains in the vaccine than what that person was carrying, and now there's extra burden on that person's immune system.
[02:46:20.730 --> 02:46:26.896]  And by the way, it is a, and that's another reason it causes cancer, because basically, your immune system is like a pair of tires.
[02:46:27.435 --> 02:46:30.378]  And the more it has to fight, the more it gets worn out.
[02:46:30.819 --> 02:46:34.602]  And then finally it just burns out and gives up, or gets hyperactive.
[02:46:34.963 --> 02:46:36.284]  Then you get blood problems.
[02:46:36.324 --> 02:46:38.486]  I mean, I've studied the epidemiology.
[02:46:38.746 --> 02:46:40.488]  I've talked to the top scientists on this.
[02:46:40.508 --> 02:46:43.451]  I mean, just the DNA fragments alone.
[02:46:43.932 --> 02:46:45.894]  And this is a live cancer virus.
[02:46:46.094 --> 02:46:49.097]  You know, now they've got the live cancer viruses that create plaques.
[02:46:55.782 --> 02:47:04.308]  Well, we are.
[02:47:04.328 --> 02:47:05.349]  Everything is distorted.
[02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:07.151]  And here's the kind of logic that they use.
[02:47:07.711 --> 02:47:19.140]  When they give these vaccines to these young girls, and then ten years down the road, many of these young girls develop cervical cancer because of the vaccine, they're going to say, oh my goodness, look, cervical cancer is on the rise.
[02:47:19.611 --> 02:47:21.914]  We need to mandate these vaccines for everyone!
[02:47:22.515 --> 02:47:31.387]  See, they're going to use what they caused as justification to... It's like Bayer is huge in the treatment of age, and they're the ones spreading it!
[02:47:32.633 --> 02:47:33.473]  Listen to me, listeners.
[02:47:33.493 --> 02:47:34.434]  Listen to me, cops.
[02:47:34.834 --> 02:47:36.616]  Listen to me, all of you who think you're part of the system.
[02:47:36.856 --> 02:47:37.656]  You are not.
[02:47:37.917 --> 02:47:40.819]  You're with Mike and I, whether you like it or not.
[02:47:41.139 --> 02:47:43.581]  I want to make that clear to the establishment, people who think they're part of it.
[02:47:43.881 --> 02:47:45.282]  You're not part of the establishment.
[02:47:45.522 --> 02:47:48.044]  You're with us in the cheap seats, whether you like it or not.
[02:47:48.484 --> 02:47:50.046]  I hope they get that through their head, Mike.
[02:47:50.326 --> 02:47:53.268]  Well, think about New Jersey has now... No, I'm sorry.
[02:47:53.308 --> 02:47:55.009]  This is Massachusetts I'm going to.
[02:47:55.370 --> 02:47:58.452]  They have mandated that you must buy health insurance.
[02:47:58.912 --> 02:48:02.093]  Health insurance that gives you coverage under the Western system of medicine.
[02:48:02.213 --> 02:48:12.155]  Hillary's telling you you've got to go get medical checkups and your kids have got to be in school when they're three and you've got to and that means they can then force you to carry out the eugenics.
[02:48:12.875 --> 02:48:17.256]  Absolutely and if you don't carry the insurance they're fining you now about a thousand dollars a year.
[02:48:17.396 --> 02:48:25.058]  Well it's like face scanning and license plate scanning now where they're going to arrest you the day your insurance is out but the illegal aliens will be selectively let go.
[02:48:26.259 --> 02:48:27.240]  I know we got a bunch of calls.
[02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:32.166]  We'll try to jam a few in in the final segment with our amazing, amazing guest, Mike Adams.
[02:48:33.588 --> 02:48:34.790]  Just a really great guy.
[02:48:34.810 --> 02:48:35.671]  We'll be right back with him.
[02:48:46.184 --> 02:48:51.426]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:48:51.566 --> 02:48:59.648]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:48:59.908 --> 02:49:06.950]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:49:07.090 --> 02:49:07.750]  We're good to go!
[02:49:34.326 --> 02:49:38.367]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:49.811]  A new world order.
[02:49:50.511 --> 02:49:54.592]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:49:54.632 --> 02:49:57.573]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:49:58.233 --> 02:49:59.454]  What's their objective being?
[02:49:59.534 --> 02:50:00.454]  World domination?
[02:50:01.014 --> 02:50:03.415]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:50:04.193 --> 02:50:11.557]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:50:14.539 --> 02:50:19.502]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:50:19.978 --> 02:50:23.460]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:50:23.840 --> 02:50:26.381]  The Overlord is making great progress in the New World Order.
[02:50:26.421 --> 02:50:27.582]  Most people have no idea.
[02:50:27.602 --> 02:50:28.362]  They're not after money.
[02:50:28.382 --> 02:50:29.483]  They have all the money they need.
[02:50:29.663 --> 02:50:30.483]  They're after power.
[02:50:30.623 --> 02:50:31.504]  That's what they're after.

[02:51:35.404 --> 02:51:39.106]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[02:51:39.926 --> 02:51:44.008]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[02:51:47.889 --> 02:51:49.170]  Boom, bop-a-boom!
[02:51:50.830 --> 02:51:51.871]  Oh, boom-a-boom!
[02:51:52.071 --> 02:51:54.852]  Oh, boom-bop-a-boom!
[02:51:55.172 --> 02:51:58.253]  Jimmy Vaughn's probably listening to the show today from a good buddy here in Austin.
[02:51:59.076 --> 02:52:00.277]  Like me butchering it, Jimmy?
[02:52:00.377 --> 02:52:04.939]  All right, I know we got loaded phone lines.
[02:52:05.059 --> 02:52:06.320]  Rocco and Mike and Maggie.
[02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:07.581]  I'm going to try to jam you all in.
[02:52:07.601 --> 02:52:09.342]  We've got to have our guests back up again next week.
[02:52:09.362 --> 02:52:11.103]  We've got a real jewel here.
[02:52:11.123 --> 02:52:15.045]  I'm sure a lot of you already found it at Stargate.com and their editor we're talking to right now.
[02:52:16.826 --> 02:52:21.789]  Look, I just want to warn people that this vaccine is causing autoimmune problems and deaths.
[02:52:22.893 --> 02:52:28.175]  I know women in Austin gave it to their kids and their kids started having convulsions or half their arm rotted off.
[02:52:28.215 --> 02:52:29.676]  I mean, this is happening.
[02:52:29.716 --> 02:52:30.936]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:52:31.456 --> 02:52:32.617]  I want to warn people.
[02:52:33.097 --> 02:52:34.057]  I just want to reach people.
[02:52:34.137 --> 02:52:37.439]  Tell people about the show, whether you listen on AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite.
[02:52:38.179 --> 02:52:39.239]  Do it today, don't wait.
[02:52:39.399 --> 02:52:40.840]  We talk about the real issues here.
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:42.000]  That's my goal.
[02:52:42.861 --> 02:52:46.122]  Tell people about Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Loose Change, Final Cut.
[02:52:46.442 --> 02:52:49.183]  Get them at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:54.842]  You know, we need to warn the people and a bunch of predatory psychopaths and sociopaths around the society.
[02:52:55.322 --> 02:52:57.883]  Mike in Georgia, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:52:57.923 --> 02:52:58.283]  Go ahead.
[02:52:58.303 --> 02:53:00.924]  Hello, Alex.
[02:53:01.264 --> 02:53:01.744]  Go ahead.
[02:53:01.764 --> 02:53:03.625]  I have two quick questions for you.
[02:53:04.045 --> 02:53:08.587]  I'm organizing the Truth Film Festival here, coming up in the next two weeks, and I know
[02:53:10.745 --> 02:53:12.026]  Yeah, here's the deal.
[02:53:12.047 --> 02:53:18.692]  I'm not going to sign a contract with you and say you can do whatever you want with it, because then I have to get in and mess with contracts and you can claim ownership.
[02:53:18.912 --> 02:53:20.173]  Just do whatever you're going to do.
[02:53:20.193 --> 02:53:20.554]  Hold on.
[02:53:20.574 --> 02:53:22.315]  Just do whatever you're going to do and I'm not going to worry about it.
[02:53:22.936 --> 02:53:23.216]  Okay?
[02:53:23.236 --> 02:53:24.497]  Just don't claim you own my film.
[02:53:24.817 --> 02:53:25.098]  Go ahead.
[02:53:25.198 --> 02:53:25.518]  That's it.
[02:53:25.698 --> 02:53:25.938]  Okay.
[02:53:26.118 --> 02:53:28.120]  Also, I wanted to talk about NAFTA Chapter 11.
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:33.385]  I just recently found out about this and basically it gives
[02:53:35.316 --> 02:53:40.099]  World Bank and World Corps and the UN Tribunal... Yeah, it's all... look, NAFTA was the North American Union.
[02:53:40.259 --> 02:53:42.981]  They just made it official in 2005, three years ago.
[02:53:43.302 --> 02:53:43.982]  It's all happening.
[02:53:44.002 --> 02:53:45.423]  Let's get a comment from Mike Adams.
[02:53:46.043 --> 02:53:48.325]  Well, I completely agree with you.
[02:53:48.345 --> 02:53:49.386]  We've got to resist this.
[02:53:50.226 --> 02:53:52.668]  I mean, the globalization effort, it's all about control.
[02:53:52.728 --> 02:53:55.870]  And like you said before, it's not just about taking your money, it's about taking your power.
[02:53:56.691 --> 02:53:59.773]  And how do they tell you there's no NAU when we're already in it in their own documents?
[02:53:59.813 --> 02:54:00.073]  Say it!
[02:54:00.931 --> 02:54:07.315]  Well, I mean, they openly put AIDS virus in your drugs and give it to you and then get away with it.
[02:54:07.355 --> 02:54:08.895]  They think you're dumb, folks.
[02:54:08.935 --> 02:54:10.236]  That's why they do this, Mike.
[02:54:10.956 --> 02:54:12.097]  Yeah, they do.
[02:54:12.117 --> 02:54:18.801]  They think that the mainstream population is very low IQ and they're giving you chemicals to make sure you remain with a low IQ.
[02:54:18.881 --> 02:54:19.421]  Absolutely.
[02:54:19.481 --> 02:54:20.882]  Mike in Georgia, thanks for the call.
[02:54:20.942 --> 02:54:22.383]  Maggie in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:54:22.403 --> 02:54:25.204]  Oh, hello.
[02:54:27.145 --> 02:54:29.847]  I watch a program called To the Contrary on PBS.
[02:54:30.879 --> 02:54:39.336]  It's a women's news panel devoted to what's considered women's issues with an all-female panel of
[02:54:40.956 --> 02:54:42.717]  Prominent, or soon to be prominent women.
[02:54:42.737 --> 02:54:45.839]  Do they make it like a feminist goody to get the shot?
[02:54:46.119 --> 02:54:47.160]  Oh, show the men!
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:52.003]  Oh, well, yeah, I wanted to tell you in particular... I don't know how their psychology works.
[02:54:52.223 --> 02:54:53.364]  It's a feminist goody.
[02:54:53.804 --> 02:55:00.108]  Sick, evil Christians don't want you to have it, because they think it's associated with sex and fun, when no one said that.
[02:55:00.329 --> 02:55:02.670]  But see, the women go, I'm a feminist, I'm gonna get it!
[02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:04.871]  I'm gonna get the live virus and die!
[02:55:05.172 --> 02:55:06.052]  See how sick they are?
[02:55:06.072 --> 02:55:07.933]  I already know what they did, Maggie, before I ever heard it.
[02:55:08.094 --> 02:55:08.694]  Go ahead and tell me.
[02:55:08.934 --> 02:55:11.175]  Well, yeah, it's a little different.
[02:55:11.256 --> 02:55:25.384]  Of course, the entire program is sort of as you described, but on this occasion, a woman named Bernadine Healy, who on the panel is introduced as a senior writer for U.S.
[02:55:25.444 --> 02:55:32.909]  News and World Report, and she's an M.D., and she was just typing this to the
[02:55:33.356 --> 02:55:34.017]  We're out of time.
[02:55:46.055 --> 02:55:47.055]  President of the U.S.
[02:55:47.135 --> 02:55:50.576]  Red Cross during 2001 when all the money disappears.
[02:55:50.616 --> 02:55:54.277]  And by the way, they're the ones taking the AIDS blood knowingly and selling it to Bayer.
[02:55:54.357 --> 02:55:54.837]  Out of time.
[02:55:54.897 --> 02:55:55.678]  Sorry, Rocco.
[02:55:55.698 --> 02:55:56.518]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:56.718 --> 02:55:58.538]  You'll go to the headline and start everybody else.
[02:55:58.778 --> 02:56:02.539]  Retransmission at InfoWars.com starts in 70 seconds.
[02:56:02.559 --> 02:56:07.041]  If you missed any of the first or second hour, the show continues on the web at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:07.341 --> 02:56:08.661]  Our guest has been Mike Adams.
[02:56:09.001 --> 02:56:11.022]  NewsTarget.com.
[02:56:11.482 --> 02:56:12.882]  And he is the health ranger.
[02:56:12.962 --> 02:56:15.263]  Sir, I'm really impressed and thankful for your great work.
[02:56:15.643 --> 02:56:16.905]  I want to have you back on the show soon.
[02:56:17.005 --> 02:56:17.826]  Thanks for coming on, Mike.
[02:56:17.846 --> 02:56:18.767]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:56:18.787 --> 02:56:19.728]  I'll be back anytime.
[02:56:19.828 --> 02:56:20.148]  You bet.
[02:56:20.188 --> 02:56:20.669]  Stay there, Mike.
[02:56:20.689 --> 02:56:22.110]  I want to talk to you after the show.
[02:56:22.491 --> 02:56:23.472]  God bless you all!
