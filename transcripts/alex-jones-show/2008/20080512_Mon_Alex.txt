[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.995]  Available at PrisonPlanet.com, or if you'd like, you can give the info or store a call at 888-253-...
[00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:17.104]  We are now into the fourth hour.
[00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:18.825]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:24.468]  Coming up, we'll be taking your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:24.528 --> 00:00:28.510]  We'll even skip some of the breaks for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.831]  We'll continue on with G. Edward Griffin during a few of the breaks.
[00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:36.353]  Or people listening on the InfoWars.com stream should go over there and be able to hear the behind-the-scenes stuff.
[00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:42.661]  G. Edward Griffin, we're going to give out his website, Freedom Force International, how to get involved, great guy.
[00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.888]  Been around for, well, since 1959, fighting the new world order, best-selling author.
[00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.857]  I mean, without getting too sidetracked into this, but I think it's important to have discussions about this sometime.
[00:00:54.878 --> 00:01:02.745]  It'll be the same guy who comes out with fake Amaro coins, who later comes out as a known FBI operative, hooked in with Sean Hannity.
[00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.748]  And then he'll come out and say there was a secret session of Congress.
[00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:10.832]  Or other groups will put out, oh, Nassera, the government's secretly good and everything's fine.
[00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:17.197]  Or Leo Wanta got trillions of dollars and he's good, but only trust him, everyone else secretly works for the Pope.
[00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:26.900]  And you can always tell these government things, they're designed for the lowest common denominator and to get any idiot camp followers to kind of go along with it.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:36.021]  Instead of saying, we can work together, we're positive, you know, the average person's good, it's evil at the top, we can affect change, we need to stop the collectivist.
[00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:45.223]  You notice that these groups that are government operatives, they never are issue specific, they never get into how things work or about what the government's doing.
[00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:46.924]  Or what the corporations are doing.
[00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:49.026]  It's always about what other patriots are doing.
[00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:55.110]  And that's why I've been trying to wake up people to stop being part of this bellicose mental illness.
[00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.431]  Do you see what I'm saying, Jim McGriffin?
[00:01:57.032 --> 00:01:57.872]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:06.999]  And I'm very grateful that there is a voice such as yours, Alex, that is such a strong voice and heard by so many people that's preaching common sense on this.
[00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.681]  Because, you know, this has been going on for a long time.
[00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.363]  You mentioned I've been in this battle more or less since about 1959.
[00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:16.325]  And this was going on even then, believe it or not.
[00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:26.407]  But unfortunately, back in those days, there was no real strong voice against it that reached very many people, and people fell for it.
[00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:33.909]  All the patriots fell for it, which is, I think, one of the reasons that nothing really developed over the years in the way of a strong counterforce against this.
[00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:49.495]  So, they were divided against each other, they fell for all of these ploys, and so we see the result of it today, but thank God you're out there telling the truth today, and we're trying to do the same thing with Freedom Force International, so maybe this time around we'll have a little better shot at it.
[00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:54.617]  This is really a war for the brain, is it not?
[00:02:54.817 --> 00:02:55.357]  It is.
[00:02:56.178 --> 00:03:01.720]  Yeah, always behind that veiled fist, or that velvet fist,
[00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:04.194]  Or the glove, I should say.
[00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:05.515]  Behind the glove is the fist.
[00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:07.256]  I'll finally get it out right here.
[00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:11.319]  But yeah, there's always the threat of physical force and coercion.
[00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:20.507]  But really, the greatest strides that our opponents have made in capturing the American people and in other countries, as well as by capturing their brains.
[00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:24.250]  They capture their minds, their information flow.
[00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.291]  They engineer their opinions.
[00:03:27.052 --> 00:03:29.214]  And this is how they control people today.
[00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:44.087]  And so we have to be alert to that and have strong leaders that can help us to, you know, weed through these rough paths and find out which are the stepping stones that are safe and which ones are dangerous.
[00:03:44.827 --> 00:03:47.109]  And that's the battle we have today.
[00:03:47.754 --> 00:03:56.782]  Now the establishment is trying to focus, though, in on organized groups and websites and authors and attacking networks and things like that.
[00:03:57.383 --> 00:04:09.774]  But overall, the loss of confidence in the state and in the organized system, the top-down hierarchical structure, is so massive and people are becoming more and more distrustful that I'm
[00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:31.067]  I'm intellectually pretty sure that the elite is in for some very rough times themselves, and of course they've foreseen that and tried to build up an oppressive grid to counter that, and they've written about how they foresaw it, but I think the wave of resistance is so big that they've got a crisis of conscience themselves, and even their own minions are saying, do I want to be part of this?
[00:04:31.929 --> 00:04:34.051]  Yeah, I think you're quite right, but they're committed.
[00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:38.715]  I don't think the guys at the top are going to have any option of turning around.
[00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:39.296]  They're committed.
[00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:47.224]  So they're not going to back down, and I think the only hope we have is to beat them at their own game, to overpower them.
[00:04:47.324 --> 00:04:48.305]  We do have numbers.
[00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:49.946]  We do have truth on our side.
[00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:51.367]  They're truly on the dark side.
[00:04:52.268 --> 00:04:53.949]  They are on the dark side.
[00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.910]  Like Shane, he said in that interview, he says, we're working on the dark side.
[00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:57.330]  Stay there.
[00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:01.632]  I'm going to talk to you during the break for the InfoWars.com stream listeners.
[00:05:01.652 --> 00:05:03.733]  Then we'll come back for everybody else on the other side.
[00:05:05.334 --> 00:05:06.735]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:07.455 --> 00:05:07.935]  G. Edward.
[00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:08.856]  A new world order.
[00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:10.096]  In the near future.
[00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:12.237]  John, go ahead and bring me up to G. Edward.
[00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:13.338]  Okay, one second here.
[00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.130]  Go ahead.
[00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.691]  Gee, Eber, we won't do too many of these behind-the-scenes breaks today.
[00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:20.031]  I'm sorry I got you on late.
[00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:23.432]  I got behind, but I do want to take some time out for solutions.
[00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:32.715]  Do you think it's a good idea to talk some about the state's election and maybe all these phony green taxes and this whole green hype, you know, repackaging socialism?
[00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:36.195]  Yeah, I'd be glad to add my two cents to it.
[00:05:36.475 --> 00:05:39.236]  You've covered it so well, but yeah, I don't think it can be overstated.
[00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:40.456]  What else?
[00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:42.137]  What are other little tidbits you want to cover?
[00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:45.216]  Oh, I don't know about tidbits.
[00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:46.336]  Those are the main topics.
[00:05:47.937 --> 00:05:48.317]  Aren't they?
[00:05:49.857 --> 00:05:51.658]  I think the phony elections.
[00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.318]  How could you overstate that?
[00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.019]  You could talk about that all day long.
[00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:56.559]  It is amazing.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.720]  And then take some time out to take some calls.
[00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:05.562]  If we were to go ten minutes over because we got you on late, would that be okay with you?
[00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:06.683]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:06:06.723 --> 00:06:06.943]  Sure.
[00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:07.683]  Okay.
[00:06:07.943 --> 00:06:08.483]  You know what then?
[00:06:08.523 --> 00:06:09.904]  How about twenty minutes into overdrive?
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.180]  That's fine with me.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.222]  Okay, well then you'll be gone in an hour and fifteen minutes, sir.
[00:06:16.362 --> 00:06:20.943]  We will be back live in just a moment.
[00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:29.166]  We might as well just go ahead and fill this time up for the listeners on InfoWars.com and also the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers right now.
[00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:34.788]  We're going to restate this on the main program, but go ahead and fire out some of your websites and books.
[00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:36.960]  Okay, well, the books.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.860]  We'll start with those.
[00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:43.364]  I think the one that is of most interest to most of your listeners is the one on the Federal Reserve System.
[00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:47.407]  It's The Creature from Jekyll Island, the second look at the Federal Reserve.
[00:06:48.328 --> 00:06:53.572]  And the other one that is of great interest to a lot of your listeners, I think, is the one on cancer.
[00:06:54.392 --> 00:06:58.675]  It's called World Without Cancer, the Story of Vitamin B-17.
[00:06:59.476 --> 00:07:05.400]  And it's about an alternative control for cancer, a non-toxic control for cancer.
[00:07:05.993 --> 00:07:07.514]  Call it what you want.
[00:07:27.237 --> 00:07:36.428]  Uh, we've got a lot of videos and audio programs just as you do, and all of this is found on our commercial site, which is called The Reality Zone.
[00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:40.753]  That's at www.realityzone.com.
[00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:43.922]  So that's the money-grubbing site.
[00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:45.943]  Hey, you've got to raise money, buddy.
[00:07:46.283 --> 00:07:48.183]  Believe me, I understand and know how it is.
[00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:52.445]  People say, it's not enough to give your films free away on the internet.
[00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.326]  You should broadcast from a ditch with a tin can.
[00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:56.986]  And I've got news for them.
[00:07:57.006 --> 00:08:02.428]  To fight the New World Order, we can't tax people and make them give us their money like the globalists do.
[00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:04.709]  We have to ask people to support us, and they should.
[00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:06.510]  Okay, we're going back to the main transmission.
[00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:06.770]  Here we go.
[00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:09.830]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.493]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.096 --> 00:08:16.358]  G. Edward Griffin is our guest.
[00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:18.921]  At the bottom of the hour, I promise, we're going directly to your calls.
[00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:21.484]  He'll be with us at least 20 minutes into overdrive today.
[00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:23.646]  We'll be going to 3.20 Central Standard Time today.
[00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:34.487]  Jebber Griffin, we were talking about the ways that globalists distract us, divert us, they try to destroy our unity.
[00:08:34.507 --> 00:08:37.809]  And I don't mean our unity as one organization.
[00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:39.530]  I don't want one group fighting the New World Order.
[00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.613]  I want lots of attack frigates out there going after them.
[00:08:43.393 --> 00:08:50.579]  But I mean, unity of purpose, our manifesto, what we believe in, you know, the liberty, you know, ideas like that.
[00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:57.243]  But then shifting gears back into, for the mainline people that are still tuned into the false paradigm, they keep saying Barack Obama
[00:08:58.286 --> 00:09:02.090]  Is about making us believe in each other again, bringing us back together.
[00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:12.699]  What they mean is, not bringing us back together, but bringing us back into being conned by the state, conned by the left-right paradigm, conned by the two parties one more time.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.804]  Taking us for one more ride while they finish getting their police state control grid in.
[00:09:17.844 --> 00:09:20.406]  And let me be clear, I'm not even entertaining a debate here.
[00:09:21.247 --> 00:09:23.328]  I'm not bashing Barack Obama here.
[00:09:23.608 --> 00:09:29.830]  The guy's a total puppet, runs nothing, nice, handsome, friendly, smart guy, but he's a globalist.
[00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.472]  I dislike him less than Hillary because she's been around a while.
[00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:38.113]  She's the devil I know, and I know she is a devil, but it doesn't matter.
[00:09:39.294 --> 00:09:42.115]  So me saying Barack Obama is a fake,
[00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:44.596]  Because I'm not saying Hillary's good.
[00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:45.777]  I'm not saying McCain's good.
[00:09:46.017 --> 00:09:47.718]  They're all bad.
[00:09:48.198 --> 00:09:54.202]  And so occasionally they give you a new puppet to make you think that things have changed.
[00:09:54.242 --> 00:09:55.963]  I'm not trying to take hope away here.
[00:09:56.443 --> 00:10:10.011]  I want you to know there's hope in real resistance, in a real awakening, in local government, in you taking action, in you running for office, in you educating others, instead of wasting all our energies like all these young people are doing,
[00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:14.972]  Starry-eyed, just, I just love Hillary, I love McCain, I love Obama!
[00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:28.956]  You know, you see all these intelligent, great-looking college girls just out there dedicating themselves to Hillary or Barack Obama, or all these well-meaning business people for McCain, when they're all America-killers, they're all globalists.
[00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.077]  G. Edward Griffin.
[00:10:31.337 --> 00:10:33.097]  Well, what can you say?
[00:10:33.117 --> 00:10:38.639]  That's true, and the reason they're that way is because their opinions have been engineered by the media.
[00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:43.942]  And to a large extent by the educational system that some of those younger people are still in.
[00:10:44.462 --> 00:10:54.910]  When you look at the campaign rhetoric of these major candidates, they can talk for hours and not really say anything, but they are masters at using words that sound good.
[00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.052]  Like, well, Obama's famous word, change.
[00:10:58.192 --> 00:10:59.053]  We want change.
[00:10:59.213 --> 00:11:00.534]  Yes, change, change, change.
[00:11:01.815 --> 00:11:04.438]  But if you asked any of them, what would you change?
[00:11:04.798 --> 00:11:07.060]  There'd probably be dead silence because they don't know.
[00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.281]  They'd say, well, we'll change the name.
[00:11:08.481 --> 00:11:13.306]  We'll change the name from Bush to Obama or something.
[00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:16.349]  But they have no idea of political principles.
[00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.554]  They have never even thought about the proper role of government or what
[00:11:22.074 --> 00:11:28.400]  The Constitution says about what these candidates are allowed or specifically not allowed to do.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:45.895]  They haven't a single thought in their entire brains about political concepts, but yet they're out there carrying these banners and chanting, as you said, and they're all starry-eyed over some kind of a word game, just change or compassion or
[00:11:47.234 --> 00:11:57.679]  Patriotism, or who knows what these words mean in the inner recesses of their minds, but they certainly don't mean anything in the realm of political principle.
[00:11:58.099 --> 00:12:03.262]  And until the American people start thinking about political principles once again, there is no hope.
[00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:11.486]  So, you're quite right when you say, why should we even entertain a debate or try to choose up sides between all three of these word masters?
[00:12:12.226 --> 00:12:19.931]  And it's not just them, it's the organizations that support them, when the real issues are never allowed to be even discussed in such a debate.
[00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:30.778]  And so, yes, our job has to be not to get entrapped by this so-called two-party system, when in reality it's not a two-party system.
[00:12:31.365 --> 00:12:33.006]  Well, it's a carnival distraction.
[00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:41.412]  It's like having a traveling carnival, a troupe of trained monkeys dance in front of you while somebody sneaks up on you to stab you in the back.
[00:12:42.873 --> 00:12:44.094]  It's distraction.
[00:12:44.114 --> 00:12:54.041]  It's the same thing that the magician does, where he has his beautiful assistant bend over in front of the crowd while he stages the hat trick.
[00:12:56.923 --> 00:12:58.384]  It works every time, doesn't it?
[00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:05.588]  Yeah, well, that was the theme of my presentation when I was there in Austin a few weeks ago, as you remember.
[00:13:05.688 --> 00:13:21.857]  We called it the Quigley Formula, and it was named after Professor Carol Quigley, who wrote the book Tragedy and Hope, who was sort of an unofficial or maybe an official historian for a secret society founded by Cecil Rhodes, and we got into all of that history.
[00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:28.321]  And the reason that history is interesting, and the reason it's important, is because without an understanding
[00:13:28.761 --> 00:13:31.543]  Of how the two-party systems came into being.
[00:13:31.843 --> 00:13:43.510]  If you don't know the history, if you don't know the fact that there is an organization that has a strategy for doing exactly what we're complaining about here, people would say, well, I guess it just happened.
[00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.851]  Well, no, it didn't just happen.
[00:13:45.271 --> 00:13:48.632]  This came about as a result of a very well-thought-out plan.
[00:13:48.672 --> 00:13:56.394]  It's being implemented today by people who have names, who belong to an organization that has a name, has a headquarters in New York, and all of that.
[00:13:56.754 --> 00:14:05.837]  And so once you tell people about the facts behind what's happening and the names and the places and the dates, then all of a sudden it becomes real.
[00:14:06.417 --> 00:14:11.778]  Other than that, before they have all that information, they'll just look at you and say, what are you talking about?
[00:14:11.798 --> 00:14:13.479]  You know, I don't think that's true.
[00:14:14.794 --> 00:14:24.540]  And so what we're facing now is the fact that the people of America are starving for information and factual data.
[00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:26.982]  Oh, I agree with you.
[00:14:28.917 --> 00:14:29.397]  I agree with you.
[00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:42.204]  They are starving and so they give them real simple pap like change, change knowing that stacked up against the two establishment candidates that another establishment candidate can be slipped in on them.
[00:14:42.565 --> 00:14:48.228]  Talk a little bit about the Quigley formula because there are hundreds of published PhD level
[00:14:49.324 --> 00:14:49.584]  I don't
[00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:22.851]  That some good ol' boy at the gym will waddle over and make fun of me saying I believe in imaginary groups when, you know, the heads of political science divisions of top universities, you know, write books about how they engineer the shadow government system and how we run nothing.
[00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:30.336]  I mean, it's very frustrating to know that we've spent the time to read all these books and watch these people on C-SPAN and then the public
[00:15:30.956 --> 00:15:39.182]  I mean, I hate the globalists, but at the same time, the public has been engineered to laugh at us for trying to save them.
[00:15:39.563 --> 00:15:41.084]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[00:15:41.744 --> 00:15:56.836]  Well, yeah, and you have to not blame the public to a certain extent, because they're just the products of programming, very effective programming, although I still think that if anybody had any kind of an instinct for truth,
[00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.017]  They would somehow break through that.
[00:15:59.037 --> 00:16:00.518]  I guess we did somehow.
[00:16:00.578 --> 00:16:06.040]  I don't know whether that was to our benefit or simply because of an accident that happened along the way.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.142]  But in any event, yeah, it is frustrating.
[00:16:08.462 --> 00:16:11.743]  But the bottom line is that this is not imaginary.
[00:16:11.943 --> 00:16:18.707]  And anybody who has any intellectual curiosity or honesty about them would say, okay, where are your facts?
[00:16:19.387 --> 00:16:20.908]  And then that's where we come in.
[00:16:20.948 --> 00:16:21.729]  Here are the facts.
[00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:30.214]  And I found that generally if you have the ability to present the facts without being interrupted, you know, give me 20 or 30 minutes.
[00:16:30.794 --> 00:16:36.738]  And if people are interested enough to sit and listen to a presentation for 20 or 30 minutes, I'll convince them.
[00:16:37.158 --> 00:16:40.921]  Not that I convince them, but the facts will convince them because they're irrefutable.
[00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:53.825]  So, that's our job, is to find those people, and that won't be many, probably 3% or less, who have the intellectual curiosity and the intellectual honesty to ask the question, where are your facts?
[00:16:54.445 --> 00:16:56.486]  And that's all we need, Alex, and you know that.
[00:16:56.886 --> 00:17:00.687]  We don't need that 51, that magic 51% of the population.
[00:17:01.227 --> 00:17:03.048]  The majority never determined anything.
[00:17:03.488 --> 00:17:10.750]  They're always led by the few, 3% or less, who can generate a majority by the strength of their leadership.
[00:17:11.388 --> 00:17:12.669]  And that's what we must do.
[00:17:12.769 --> 00:17:14.071]  That's what our enemies have done.
[00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:27.324]  And as you know, that's what Freedom Force is all about, is to move into the power centers of society, those groups and organizations that people belong to, that lead the political thinking of the nation.
[00:17:27.684 --> 00:17:32.129]  We have to become influential in those groups now, just the way our opponents have in the past.
[00:17:32.449 --> 00:17:37.773]  Well, now again, I'm trying to be subtle here, not that I'm delicate, or not that I'm even well-spoken.
[00:17:37.813 --> 00:17:39.554]  Maybe I haven't explained it right to some people.
[00:17:40.114 --> 00:17:41.435]  I'm not against the militia.
[00:17:41.495 --> 00:17:42.556]  I believe in the militia.
[00:17:42.616 --> 00:17:44.237]  I'm a member of the militia, 18 to 44.
[00:17:44.277 --> 00:17:45.838]  We're all part of it.
[00:17:47.319 --> 00:17:50.762]  And it's in our Constitution, and the feds say we have no right to own guns.
[00:17:51.202 --> 00:17:53.664]  It's only an organized militia, but that didn't exist until 1907.
[00:17:55.805 --> 00:18:10.914]  So, we know it's our right to keep and bear arms, it's to defend against criminals and the government, and I've read the Federalist Papers and others on air, but then you've got what the modern militia movement is, and that's Feds setting up innocent good people
[00:18:11.494 --> 00:18:31.683]  And usually the militia leaders are feds, and it's a thing of paranoia, don't trust your neighbors, meet us behind the barn, and then the feds says let's build a bomb so they can send a bunch of innocent farmers to jail, and then asset forfeiture their farms, and then I get on air and I say watch out, we're up front, we're in suits and ties, we're well spoken, we're the good guys.
[00:18:32.383 --> 00:18:42.434]  But the Feds, when they run these operations, they've tried to always steer our movement into hiding, like it's secret agent stuff, and it's all, oh my God, everyone's watching you and wanting to get you.
[00:18:42.634 --> 00:18:44.877]  And I'm saying, no, no, no, this isn't a thing of paranoia.
[00:18:45.397 --> 00:18:46.579]  We are the good guys.
[00:18:46.699 --> 00:18:51.364]  We're out in the town square with the white hat at high noon saying, bring it on.
[00:18:51.985 --> 00:18:52.906]  Do you see the point I'm making?
[00:18:53.346 --> 00:18:54.066]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:55.207]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:18:55.807 --> 00:19:04.732]  And, yeah, it has always worried me deeply as to the character that the militia movements have taken.
[00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:07.033]  They're going in the wrong direction.
[00:19:07.093 --> 00:19:17.738]  And I think the reason, as you've just stated, is because they are under the influence of Asia provocateurs who are sent in there to do that, just to mess it up so it won't possibly work.
[00:19:17.978 --> 00:19:20.781]  Oh, we've caught them hundreds of times in every case.
[00:19:21.982 --> 00:19:23.343]  It turns out that's what they do.
[00:19:24.764 --> 00:19:25.585]  So, they're smart.
[00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:27.667]  So, okay, they're smart.
[00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:28.868]  Now, what are we going to do about it?
[00:19:28.928 --> 00:19:30.029]  Let's be just as smart.
[00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:31.811]  Let's not let them win that game.
[00:19:33.142 --> 00:19:36.164]  Let's be aware of it and move around it.
[00:19:36.484 --> 00:19:45.472]  Well, I remember when I was just a mainline conservative, but fighting for property rights locally, I'd have a guy show up at an event and say, I want to work with you, let's kill cops.
[00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:49.054]  And I'd follow him outside, and a guy getting an unmarked cop car.
[00:19:50.295 --> 00:19:52.617]  You know, I mean, it's just, these people are criminals.
[00:19:53.277 --> 00:19:54.478]  Dirtbag slime.
[00:19:55.459 --> 00:20:00.422]  And, uh, well, Texas Monthly caught the FBI creating a Klan group trying to get them to blow up a chemical plant.
[00:20:00.882 --> 00:20:03.003]  They were so dumb, the FBI couldn't get them to do it.
[00:20:05.405 --> 00:20:06.806]  It is a big idea.
[00:20:07.886 --> 00:20:08.887]  A new world order.
[00:20:09.622 --> 00:20:11.303]  In the near future, Earth is dominated.
[00:20:11.383 --> 00:20:12.164]  You can't stop us now!
[00:20:12.204 --> 00:20:13.565]  No matter how hard you try!
[00:20:45.979 --> 00:20:47.800]  We're good to go.
[00:21:07.794 --> 00:21:08.416]  And I'll tell you why.
[00:21:08.656 --> 00:21:17.054]  It's because the globalists claim that their breeding makes them god men when they're really a bunch of inbred, mentally retarded individuals at the top.
[00:21:18.456 --> 00:21:22.661]  With these criminal bureaucracies that serve them, that's where their genius still lies.
[00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:28.327]  The truth is, from the common people also comes intelligence, and we don't want to be your slaves.
[00:21:29.328 --> 00:21:31.891]  We're not lesser men, and we're not going to go along with you.
[00:21:31.931 --> 00:21:38.679]  G. Edward Griffin will talk through the next segment, the next break, for Infowars.com internet stream listeners, but right now,
[00:21:39.139 --> 00:21:51.122]  You want to get into Carol Quigley and the Quigley Method because I didn't want to kind of give away your thunder when you were on before you gave your UT speech, but maybe now you should spend some time on that and then we'll start taking phone calls in about 10 minutes.
[00:21:51.802 --> 00:21:57.343]  Yeah, I'd like to do that, Alex, but may I finish where my brain was going with our last?
[00:21:57.423 --> 00:21:57.843]  Certainly.
[00:21:58.844 --> 00:22:00.584]  We were talking about false leadership.
[00:22:01.327 --> 00:22:09.017]  And how effective that can be, especially if the victim is not even aware of the possibility that this tactic is being used.
[00:22:10.199 --> 00:22:19.831]  Every once in a while, after I've written something or said something about this, I'll get an email from some person that says, how do we know that you are not a false leader?
[00:22:20.732 --> 00:22:22.213]  And of course, that's a darn good question.
[00:22:22.253 --> 00:22:27.395]  I'm very happy to hear that, because now I know that people are beginning to look around and question.
[00:22:27.815 --> 00:22:29.615]  And the answer to that is very simple.
[00:22:30.116 --> 00:22:38.239]  You can tell whether a person is a false leader or not simply by looking at their record, where they've been, how long they've been doing it, and what they've actually done.
[00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:38.959]  Their fruits!
[00:22:39.519 --> 00:22:41.520]  Their fruits shall reveal them, yeah.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:55.290]  So you see, if they have a record of dividing people, whether they have a record of diverting attention away from the real culprit, which is the government, not government, but people in government, I always want to emphasize that.
[00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.151]  We're not opposed to government.
[00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:59.473]  We're opposed to corruption in government.
[00:23:00.263 --> 00:23:08.852]  And if you can see that leaders have been focused on the corruption in government and consistently have tried to unite people, they're probably on the right track.
[00:23:09.332 --> 00:23:20.884]  But if they've always left behind them a debris of broken organizations and anger and division, you've got a pretty good idea that you're dealing with a false leader.
[00:23:21.918 --> 00:23:22.318]  I think so.
[00:23:38.246 --> 00:23:38.567]  I think so.
[00:23:54.870 --> 00:24:06.118]  Well, I'll say, G. Edward Griffin, the enemy doesn't operate for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 40 plus years since 1959, as you have been doing.
[00:24:06.138 --> 00:24:07.238]  That's almost 50 years.
[00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:11.261]  No, they reveal themselves quickly, especially in our own movement.
[00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:13.202]  They usually work about a year.
[00:24:13.242 --> 00:24:15.024]  In fact, it's usually exactly 12 months.
[00:24:15.064 --> 00:24:15.924]  It's phase 1.
[00:24:16.224 --> 00:24:23.289]  They try to build an audience on radio, internet, TV, and then suddenly they attack everyone and say you can't trust anyone.
[00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:24.110]  It's nothing but division.
[00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:30.632]  I will tell people that most of the groups and organizations out there are actually good.
[00:24:30.692 --> 00:24:34.533]  The folks out on the ground are good.
[00:24:36.593 --> 00:24:41.815]  But you can really tell the organizations and people that are bad.
[00:24:42.415 --> 00:24:45.095]  I mean, G. Everett Griffin, we know you're good.
[00:24:45.936 --> 00:24:48.896]  We know so many others are good as well.
[00:24:49.277 --> 00:24:50.737]  And a lot of it is also discernment.
[00:24:51.597 --> 00:24:53.298]  You know, having your head in the game a long time.
[00:24:54.878 --> 00:25:05.481]  You know, not just being aware of disinfo, being aware of also the fact that we can also get too into this where we're too focused and paranoid and then never just move forward.
[00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:18.164]  I think really having a good attitude, viewers out there, listeners out there, you know that you're good people, you know you're leaders, you know that you've done nothing wrong, you know that you're doing this for the right reasons, so you be leaders.
[00:25:18.624 --> 00:25:20.344]  You go out and start organizations.
[00:25:20.384 --> 00:25:22.725]  I mean, I think, you know, there's no excuse there.
[00:25:22.785 --> 00:25:23.605]  Is there, G. Edward Griffin?
[00:25:24.205 --> 00:25:26.087]  No, no, no excuse at all, whatsoever.
[00:25:26.627 --> 00:25:29.871]  And, you know, in a way, that takes us back, finally, to the Quigley formula.
[00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:37.578]  Because Quigley was talking, to a very important extent, about how to provide false leadership.
[00:25:38.388 --> 00:25:40.670]  And so, I'll be ready for that topic.
[00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:16.354]  Yeah, well I think it's important to start this off to know who Quigley is.
[00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:27.123]  We're talking about Professor Carol Quigley, who was a professor at Georgetown University and was one of the teachers of Bill Clinton when he was a student there.
[00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:40.358]  And, um, 27 years later, when Clinton was nominated for the presidency at the Democratic Convention, in his acceptance speech, he gave an honorable mention to Professor Quigley.
[00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:52.407]  And then, even after Clinton was elected president, in at least two public appearances of which I'm aware, he again gave honorable mention to this professor at Georgetown University.
[00:26:52.447 --> 00:26:55.469]  So, he obviously felt he was a pretty important person.
[00:26:56.389 --> 00:27:03.653]  And there were two messages there, because those who did not understand who Quigley was thought that, oh, well, that was nice.
[00:27:03.693 --> 00:27:11.536]  He was just giving honorable mention to some kindly old professor who had a profound impact on his political thinking, and isn't that nice?
[00:27:12.176 --> 00:27:17.299]  But those who knew who Quigley was and what he represented understood there was a hidden message there.
[00:27:18.101 --> 00:27:22.786]  Quigley was the official historian of a secret society.
[00:27:23.447 --> 00:27:24.768]  And he wrote two books about it.
[00:27:24.828 --> 00:27:26.430]  This society is real.
[00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.533]  This is not one of those conspiracy theory things.
[00:27:29.593 --> 00:27:30.754]  This is very real.
[00:27:31.355 --> 00:27:34.518]  And Professor Quigley was the historian of it.
[00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:40.645]  And the secret society was formed by Cecil Rhodes at the turn of the last century in England.
[00:27:41.594 --> 00:27:56.420]  And Cecil Rhodes devoted the bulk of his entire vast fortune that he made so much money in South Africa because he personally owned the diamond mines and most of the gold resources of that country.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.241]  One of the wealthiest men in the world.
[00:27:59.113 --> 00:28:08.818]  People know that generally, but what they don't know is that he left the bulk of his inheritance, not to his estate, not to his family, but to create a secret society.
[00:28:09.379 --> 00:28:14.441]  We know about this because there was a book written by the executor of his estate.
[00:28:15.042 --> 00:28:24.067]  The executor's name was William Stead, and he wrote about the... in fact, the title of the book was The Last Will and Testament of Cecil Roach.
[00:28:24.627 --> 00:28:28.089]  And so he described the purpose of these wills and
[00:28:29.395 --> 00:28:31.617]  Quigley himself was a part of this group.
[00:28:31.677 --> 00:28:34.420]  He was allowed to examine its private papers.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:40.365]  Quigley said in one of his books that he admired this secret society.
[00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:42.507]  He had no aversion to it.
[00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:47.672]  He said the only difference of opinion that he had was that this group wished to remain unknown.
[00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:56.073]  But by writing these books that Quigley did, just about everything that this group did became a part of the historical record.
[00:28:56.733 --> 00:29:02.236]  It was not really intended for consumption by the gum-chewing public.
[00:29:02.276 --> 00:29:12.860]  These were academic books meant to be read by academicians, scholarly works, meant to be read by those who were involved in the secret society.
[00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.100]  We're coming back.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.021]  Let's continue with Quigley from there.
[00:29:17.562 --> 00:29:17.902]  Here we go.
[00:29:25.043 --> 00:29:26.525]  We'll be going into overdrive.
[00:29:26.565 --> 00:29:29.929]  That is, the main radio show is four hours, Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:29:29.949 --> 00:29:33.412]  to 3 p.m., and I come back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:29:33.432 --> 00:29:37.116]  This New World Order takeover is very serious, and I take it very serious.
[00:29:37.136 --> 00:29:39.639]  That's why I work normally about 14 hours a day.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.762]  I've cut back from 18 hours a day.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:50.805]  That's why I've made a new film that I'll be showing at the Alamo Draft House this Saturday at 3.30 at downtown Alamo at their new, quote, Ritz location.
[00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:53.027]  Details at Infowars.com.
[00:29:53.667 --> 00:30:01.293]  For Infowars.com listeners on our internet streams and for those watching presentplanet.tv, we continue during the break talking about Carol Quigley,
[00:30:01.773 --> 00:30:03.974]  Now, who set up the Rhodes Scholarship Program.
[00:30:03.994 --> 00:30:09.137]  He owned the major diamond mines and gold mines in Rhodesia, in South Africa, north of there.
[00:30:10.198 --> 00:30:13.199]  And, of course, it turned out he was just an agent of the Queen the entire time.
[00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:19.123]  And, of course, one of his people that worked for him wrote a book about it after he died.
[00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:23.185]  Do you think everybody that is a Rhodes Scholar ends up staying on their payroll?
[00:30:23.225 --> 00:30:26.347]  Because we see a Chris Christopherson who speaks out against him.
[00:30:27.087 --> 00:30:29.849]  We see a Naomi Wolf who comes out and
[00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:31.530]  Speaks out against it.
[00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.531]  You know, the Marshall Law setup.
[00:30:33.571 --> 00:30:36.153]  But I had her on the show a few months ago and I said, but you're a Rhodes Scholar.
[00:30:36.173 --> 00:30:39.034]  I said, people ask how we get these guests.
[00:30:39.435 --> 00:30:41.196]  We call their publicist, we get them on.
[00:30:41.236 --> 00:30:42.437]  You can try it too if you'd like.
[00:30:42.717 --> 00:30:44.558]  They think it's a conspiracy that we're able to get them on.
[00:30:44.578 --> 00:30:45.959]  It's a big radio show, folks.
[00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:47.240]  They want to come on and pitch their book.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.382]  And you can call them, too, and get them on your show, probably.
[00:30:50.883 --> 00:30:52.844]  If you know how to talk to somebody on the telephone, that is.
[00:30:52.864 --> 00:30:54.766]  That's the big conspiracy, is just to act friendly.
[00:30:55.347 --> 00:30:57.008]  I'm just being sarcastic to some people out there.
[00:30:57.028 --> 00:30:58.789]  But the point is, I had her on and asked the hard question.
[00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:00.431]  I said, are you for a world government?
[00:31:00.471 --> 00:31:01.091]  She said, no.
[00:31:01.552 --> 00:31:03.433]  They didn't teach me that in a Rhodes Scholarship.
[00:31:03.693 --> 00:31:11.300]  But I know that Cecil Rhodes called for a world government, called for a British, Anglophile-dominated system, merged with the Rothschilds.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.682]  So do you think Naomi Wolf is fibbing there?
[00:31:14.721 --> 00:31:18.706]  No, that's a really good question and you're not the first person that asked that question of me.
[00:31:19.668 --> 00:31:28.500]  I find it hard to believe that a person can be selected as a Rhodes Scholarship and actually go through the whole process and be educated there in London.
[00:31:29.493 --> 00:31:34.098]  And be part of that group without being a devotee of world government.
[00:31:34.178 --> 00:31:36.540]  I just find that very, very difficult.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:41.564]  You know, Chris Christopherson's people said they knew who we were, but they weren't going to come on the show.
[00:31:42.265 --> 00:31:48.210]  Then we get Willie Nelson and Jesse Ventura and Tommy Chong and Charlie Sheen and German defense ministers.
[00:31:48.931 --> 00:31:53.175]  The incredible thing is I had the head of the Kissinger Group on last week.
[00:31:53.715 --> 00:31:56.518]  And when I got him on during the break, I said, hello sir, and he started laughing at me.
[00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:57.239]  And I said, what's funny?
[00:31:57.259 --> 00:31:58.381]  And he goes, oh, Alex Jones.
[00:31:58.921 --> 00:32:00.063]  And I said, oh, you know who I am?
[00:32:00.123 --> 00:32:02.085]  And he goes, of course we all know who you are.
[00:32:02.105 --> 00:32:04.228]  In fact, John Harmon running the show heard it.
[00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:10.976]  Hey John, were you listening in on that conversation I had with the head of the Kissinger Group?
[00:32:11.716 --> 00:32:12.257]  Yes I was.
[00:32:12.557 --> 00:32:13.218]  Are you on air right now?
[00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:14.459]  Now I am.
[00:32:15.179 --> 00:32:15.879]  Bring yourself on air.
[00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:23.641]  Did you hear how he admitted, I mean, I didn't want to toot my horn on air, would have sounded obnoxious, but after the fact, it isn't that he knew who I was, it's actually scary.
[00:32:24.061 --> 00:32:29.422]  This is the head of the Kissinger Group, one of the heads of the Carnegie Endowment, and he's saying, yeah, we know, we all know who you are.
[00:32:29.602 --> 00:32:30.442]  Well, John, you heard it.
[00:32:30.482 --> 00:32:32.722]  Tell, uh, tell Jebber Griffin what he was saying.
[00:32:33.062 --> 00:32:39.123]  Oh, yeah, he was very arrogant, and, uh, you know, Jones was joking with him, calling him master, and he seemed to like that, actually.
[00:32:40.403 --> 00:32:40.964]  So, uh, yeah.
[00:32:41.624 --> 00:32:43.224]  Yeah, I'm sure he does like that.
[00:32:43.843 --> 00:32:49.087]  These guys are, you know, very arrogant and, you know, they want people just to do what they say.
[00:32:49.828 --> 00:32:58.234]  Yeah, see what happened is we got him queued up and I, you know, John called him at like 29 after and then he was going to be on at 33 after.
[00:32:58.495 --> 00:33:00.196]  So I come on and say, thank you for coming on.
[00:33:00.216 --> 00:33:03.499]  We're not live yet, but I'm going to have you on in just a moment, sir.
[00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:06.601]  He started laughing at me and I said, was something wrong?
[00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:09.063]  And he said, nah, Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.483 --> 00:33:10.204]  And I went, what?
[00:33:10.224 --> 00:33:10.704]  Do you know who I am?
[00:33:10.764 --> 00:33:12.746]  And he goes, of course we know who you are.
[00:33:13.146 --> 00:33:15.388]  I mean, folks, do you realize they know who I am?
[00:33:15.408 --> 00:33:22.132]  G. Edward Griffin, that means we must be hurting him if he wanted to arrogantly laugh at me before we went on air.
[00:33:22.152 --> 00:33:25.094]  I mean, I remember six years ago in L.A.
[00:33:25.534 --> 00:33:35.741]  having Lionel Shetwan, who made the film about Bush being a hero in 9-11, the head of his film commission, came up in the bathroom while I was at the urinal and threatened me and said, we're going to get you.
[00:33:36.061 --> 00:33:37.662]  And then I went out on TV and debated him.
[00:33:37.702 --> 00:33:39.324]  But I mean, I'm not tooting my horn.
[00:33:39.364 --> 00:33:40.244]  That's actually scary.
[00:33:40.264 --> 00:33:42.966]  But that shows how real this is, doesn't it, G. Edward?
[00:33:43.426 --> 00:33:49.031]  Oh yeah, this is real stuff, and usually it doesn't happen in the bathroom.
[00:33:49.171 --> 00:33:54.855]  It usually happens in the boardroom, but it's very real stuff, Alex, and yeah, you bet they know who you are.
[00:33:55.816 --> 00:33:57.177]  You're a thorn in their side.
[00:33:58.478 --> 00:33:59.639]  People ask why they haven't killed me.
[00:33:59.659 --> 00:34:00.880]  Why do they think they haven't killed G.E.B.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.221]  or Griffin, haven't killed Alex Jones?
[00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:06.264]  I know you're sick of being asked that, but people are obsessed with it, so please humor them.
[00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:08.434]  Well, I know how they work.
[00:34:09.095 --> 00:34:16.022]  They want us both eliminated, and they have a definite hierarchy of strategies for that.
[00:34:17.864 --> 00:34:19.325]  I've observed it over the years.
[00:34:19.345 --> 00:34:22.849]  The first thing they do if they want to eliminate their opposition is to ignore it.
[00:34:23.559 --> 00:34:27.100]  And, you know, in 99% of the cases, that works just fine.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:37.503]  You don't have to do anything, because their opponents have no funding, they have no voice, they have no following, they have no way to survive, really.
[00:34:37.523 --> 00:34:42.724]  And so, usually, they're just a little splash in the pan, and then they go away, entirely on their own.
[00:34:43.365 --> 00:34:44.926]  So the first step is to ignore it.
[00:34:45.407 --> 00:34:48.409]  If that doesn't work, well, the next step is to discredit it.
[00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:51.371]  To destroy it in the eyes of the American public.
[00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:54.533]  This is where they bring their big media guns into play.
[00:34:55.654 --> 00:35:01.739]  They try and paint that big brush around the face of their target that makes them look like a
[00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:08.761]  Some kind of a real nut, a child molester, a tax evader, a terrorist.
[00:35:08.861 --> 00:35:12.682]  God only knows what they can throw at the American public.
[00:35:12.762 --> 00:35:13.302]  A hater!
[00:35:13.322 --> 00:35:14.082]  Some people believe it.
[00:35:14.782 --> 00:35:16.363]  A hater or something like that.
[00:35:16.383 --> 00:35:19.504]  A fascist, a Nazi, a communist.
[00:35:19.524 --> 00:35:20.724]  They've got all kinds of words.
[00:35:20.784 --> 00:35:21.804]  A racist.
[00:35:22.204 --> 00:35:25.205]  They've got a bushel basket full of words they can throw out.
[00:35:25.745 --> 00:35:28.586]  And unfortunately, most of the American people will believe it.
[00:35:29.289 --> 00:35:30.690]  So, that usually works.
[00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:34.932]  I mean, the few that survive step number one get eliminated at step number two.
[00:35:36.032 --> 00:35:45.777]  If they survive step number two, then the next level of opposition is to try and buy them off, either directly or indirectly.
[00:35:46.137 --> 00:35:57.123]  They provide funding, or they provide investments in their corporations, and they load their board of directors, and over a period of time, all of a sudden, their organizations are bought off.
[00:35:57.942 --> 00:35:59.684]  And sometimes they're even offered money.
[00:35:59.704 --> 00:36:01.105]  Why don't you just go retire?
[00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:02.105]  You're old enough now.
[00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:03.907]  You've done your share.
[00:36:03.927 --> 00:36:06.189]  You can go live in the Bahamas.
[00:36:06.249 --> 00:36:09.631]  We have this estate for you and a chauffeur and a limousine and so forth.
[00:36:10.472 --> 00:36:11.973]  And why don't you just go away?
[00:36:12.874 --> 00:36:19.859]  And if that doesn't work, then finally they turn to more physical things where sometimes people are suicided or
[00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:21.712]  That kind of thing.
[00:36:21.852 --> 00:36:23.154]  But I know what they do.
[00:36:23.174 --> 00:36:24.495]  This is pretty predictable.
[00:36:25.056 --> 00:36:32.886]  So the fact that you and I are still surviving means that I guess we haven't been discredited yet.
[00:36:33.362 --> 00:36:34.623]  Well, here's what's happening.
[00:36:34.643 --> 00:36:39.366]  I had Nightline call me, and I know that's an operation.
[00:36:39.666 --> 00:36:40.527]  That show's come out.
[00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:42.288]  Is CIA Pentagon run?
[00:36:42.408 --> 00:36:43.969]  And I just basically told them no.
[00:36:43.989 --> 00:36:49.874]  I said, I have no... First, they wanted to talk to me at first, and I said, we are changing.
[00:36:49.894 --> 00:36:50.634]  You want to talk to them?
[00:36:51.194 --> 00:36:52.816]  And most people would kill to be on Nightline.
[00:36:52.876 --> 00:36:53.556]  Not me, folks.
[00:36:54.357 --> 00:36:57.259]  The old adage, any publicity is good publicity, is actually not true.
[00:36:57.819 --> 00:37:07.666]  And I just said, you know what, because Discovery Channel comes in, History Channel comes in, BBC comes in, and they'll tell you, oh, I'm a fan.
[00:37:07.686 --> 00:37:09.528]  And I go, come on, I know you're lying.
[00:37:09.568 --> 00:37:10.669]  I see the predatory look.
[00:37:10.689 --> 00:37:11.609]  I know it's a hit piece.
[00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.011]  And then it's a total dishonest hit piece.
[00:37:15.352 --> 00:37:19.615]  And now at this point, they are so discredited.
[00:37:21.198 --> 00:37:22.519]  Now if it's live, I'll do it.
[00:37:22.539 --> 00:37:24.721]  I've always said I won't turn down anything that's live.
[00:37:27.623 --> 00:37:33.186]  I do get those opportunities few and far between and I don't turn them down because there I can actually try to get something out.
[00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:36.529]  But to have the head of the Kissinger Group, which
[00:37:36.989 --> 00:37:46.731]  As you know, it's one of the most powerful groups out there, and that's a Rothschild slash Rockefeller management group, saying, yeah, I'm coming on, I'm coming on to counter you guys.
[00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:52.133]  And I said on air, I said, you guys must really be in trouble if you're having to go ahead and come on shows now.
[00:37:52.213 --> 00:37:55.313]  And he basically just said, yeah.
[00:37:55.393 --> 00:38:00.255]  And other people have gone out and confronted Glubb, illicit events, and said the New World Order is falling apart.
[00:38:00.275 --> 00:38:02.815]  And they say, well, it's in trouble, but we're going to keep it going.
[00:38:03.295 --> 00:38:04.356]  I mean, this is their life.
[00:38:04.476 --> 00:38:05.396]  Do you want to comment on that?
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:18.695]  Well yeah, I think it is their life and they know how to manipulate public opinion so these guys must have thought that by coming on to your show that they were clever enough and skilled enough to
[00:38:20.823 --> 00:38:30.088]  To create, to move public opinion against you, I guess, or to capture your audience in some way, or at least to paint the picture that they were really nice guys after all.
[00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:33.811]  They must have had some vision of how... Well no, they were trying to humanize themselves.
[00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:39.254]  He made, we counted it, 10 times in 30 minute interview, which is I guess about 20.
[00:38:40.174 --> 00:38:41.175]  Five minutes of air time.
[00:38:41.836 --> 00:38:49.783]  He said ten times, well, we've got evil robber barons and we've got to have a world government to contain and control them.
[00:38:50.243 --> 00:38:51.884]  Well, that we've already got a world government.
[00:38:51.904 --> 00:38:53.406]  These guys already do what they want.
[00:38:53.706 --> 00:38:55.568]  We've got to have this global government to control them.
[00:38:55.968 --> 00:38:58.830]  And I said on air, I said, you've said that a bunch of times.
[00:38:58.850 --> 00:38:59.791]  And he got mad at that.
[00:39:00.192 --> 00:39:01.853]  I said, you're just putting a talking point out.
[00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:03.234]  And he said, well, I'm allowed to have my view.
[00:39:03.595 --> 00:39:04.796]  And I said, you are the guys that
[00:39:05.356 --> 00:39:06.017]  We're good to go.
[00:39:26.644 --> 00:39:28.205]  No, his attitude totally changed.
[00:39:28.245 --> 00:39:31.106]  Well, I guess he just didn't achieve his goal, that's all.
[00:39:31.547 --> 00:39:47.115]  But you know, thinking back to Naomi, and you asked her whether or not she really might be sincere or not, I have no doubt that she is totally sincere in her opposition to martial law and in her opposition to the neocon agenda.
[00:39:47.715 --> 00:39:51.037]  But my question is, why does she not mention anything
[00:39:52.033 --> 00:39:56.576]  About the left-wing agenda that is advocated by... It's identical.
[00:39:57.056 --> 00:40:03.700]  It's just got a different... It's like a velvet iron fist, you know, a red glove or a black glove over it.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:11.705]  It's identical, and she plays the game of trying to make it seem like it's all a right-wing conspiracy.
[00:40:12.425 --> 00:40:14.546]  And totally ignores the left wing.
[00:40:14.586 --> 00:40:21.088]  And you and I both know the left wing and the right wing are just two different wings of the same ugly bird called collectivism.
[00:40:21.588 --> 00:40:31.512]  So when I see a Rhodes Scholar that's playing the game of focusing totally on one side of this little scam and not the other, I know what she's doing.
[00:40:31.632 --> 00:40:34.713]  She's trying to generate support for the Democrats.
[00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:37.194]  That's what her mission is, as far as I can tell.
[00:40:37.214 --> 00:40:38.195]  And so it's like Judo.
[00:40:38.775 --> 00:40:40.636]  It's a classic left-right paradigm.
[00:40:40.897 --> 00:40:47.941]  They're using an attack on the right wing of their sector, like a solar panel, to actually energize the other side of the wing.
[00:40:48.341 --> 00:40:49.502]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:40:50.303 --> 00:40:56.687]  And I don't think somebody as smart as a Rhodes Scholar would accidentally do that.
[00:40:56.767 --> 00:40:58.488]  I mean, she has to know what she's doing.
[00:40:59.088 --> 00:41:03.554]  Well, I've talked to her privately and she is really friendly, like a great saleswoman.
[00:41:04.154 --> 00:41:07.278]  And she's like, oh, please send me all that info.
[00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:08.720]  Alex, thank you so much.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.102]  But I can tell it is a mask.
[00:41:12.044 --> 00:41:13.605]  And I'm going to get her back on.
[00:41:13.806 --> 00:41:15.508]  Maybe I should get her back on and have you on weather.
[00:41:16.408 --> 00:41:17.789]  Well, I would love to talk to her.
[00:41:18.089 --> 00:41:19.890]  I would love to sit down and meet her.
[00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.732]  You know, there's always the chance that we're wrong, or that I'm wrong.
[00:41:22.832 --> 00:41:27.194]  Well, there's always the chance that they see what's happening and they want to turn back.
[00:41:27.935 --> 00:41:31.497]  But you're right, she would then be attacking the whole left side of the paradigm.
[00:41:31.977 --> 00:41:34.138]  Yes, she should be, because there's no difference.
[00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:38.661]  But the good news is, everywhere she goes now, as I've seen the YouTubes, that's being brought up to her.
[00:41:39.577 --> 00:41:39.977]  Oh, it is.
[00:41:40.037 --> 00:41:41.157]  By leftists.
[00:41:41.577 --> 00:41:45.398]  They're going... I mean, are you not seeing what I'm... I mean, I just want your opinion because I don't know.
[00:41:46.759 --> 00:41:51.960]  I'm finally seeing the left, like never before, break their chains and become liberty lovers and get past these labels.
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.400]  They're buying guns.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:55.300]  They understand the government's bad.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.121]  They understand any government funding that's given is going to go to corporations.
[00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:02.342]  They finally, you know, they finally, I think, are getting it.
[00:42:03.345 --> 00:42:04.826]  Well, you mean at the grassroots level?
[00:42:04.866 --> 00:42:05.106]  Yes.
[00:42:05.646 --> 00:42:14.111]  Yes, no doubt at the grassroots, but up there at the higher elevations where you need oxygen, debris, those guys know exactly what's going on.
[00:42:16.352 --> 00:42:17.212]  How did they do that?
[00:42:19.565 --> 00:42:25.934]  You talk about how first they ignore you, then they attack you, or first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[00:42:25.974 --> 00:42:28.597]  As Gandhi said, I kind of had it in reverse.
[00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:31.601]  These headhunters, in 1998, even 1997, I had like
[00:42:35.226 --> 00:42:46.340]  People call me who were big-shot Democrats when I was attacking Bill Clinton, and then I'd find out who they were, and you know, they would say, well, meet with me, but you've got to promise not to say we met, and so I can't say their names.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:51.646]  I always, you know, follow my word, unless it's something criminal, and then you meet with this famous Democrat.
[00:42:52.427 --> 00:43:05.142]  Or you meet with another person, and this has happened maybe five or six times, and then later it was corporate offers of millions of dollars to be basically a right-winger and put out kind of a new hardcore brand of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:43:05.162 --> 00:43:07.484]  I mean, I turned down 600 stations, basically.
[00:43:07.925 --> 00:43:08.966]  I was going to be tested out.
[00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:14.470]  And I guess most people, you just give them the offer that they just want that money.
[00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.050]  But money doesn't matter to me.
[00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.932]  It's ideas that I traffic in.
[00:43:19.212 --> 00:43:20.132]  It's history.
[00:43:20.192 --> 00:43:20.933]  It's humanity.
[00:43:21.393 --> 00:43:22.433]  It's the species.
[00:43:22.513 --> 00:43:23.434]  It's my children.
[00:43:23.754 --> 00:43:24.934]  I serve ideals.
[00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:27.956]  I guess they see me as a foolish romantic.
[00:43:28.236 --> 00:43:30.777]  But everything we've got was built on romanticism.
[00:43:31.918 --> 00:43:33.098]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:43:33.238 --> 00:43:36.620]  That's exactly the spirit of America that we need to revive.
[00:43:38.683 --> 00:43:44.588]  Well, I just can't... I mean, they generate fiat money out of nothing, and then they buy the world with it.
[00:43:44.628 --> 00:43:45.629]  It's such a scam!
[00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:50.452]  Well, it is a scam, but it works, and it's very frustrating to all of us.
[00:43:50.512 --> 00:43:56.037]  In fact, every once in a while, I still go through that dark night where you wonder, is this really worth it?
[00:43:56.557 --> 00:43:59.720]  Is humanity capable of salvaging itself?
[00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:05.978]  And of course, when the sun rises in the morning, you always say, yes, you bet, and I'm going to be part of it, and you charge back into it.
[00:44:06.358 --> 00:44:17.487]  But boy, it gets awful discouraging at times, because people, you know, you look around, and even in your closest circle of friends, and even some in your family, you think, well, these are excellent people.
[00:44:17.887 --> 00:44:24.112]  And yet, you see them kind of sell out when it comes time to get a job, for example.
[00:44:24.573 --> 00:44:25.814]  I've seen people work for
[00:44:27.815 --> 00:44:30.836]  Well, let's just be specific for the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:44:31.157 --> 00:44:38.039]  Beautiful people, I know, and yet they're out there selling these drugs, and you know, deep down underneath, they know that they're hurting people.
[00:44:38.379 --> 00:44:40.220]  But boy, is that pay good!
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.662]  And does that car that the company provides, is it nice?
[00:44:44.082 --> 00:44:49.464]  And boy, these trips they take to the South Pacific Islands, all paid for by the company.
[00:44:49.944 --> 00:44:51.024]  Can you turn that down?
[00:44:51.165 --> 00:44:52.165]  But it's all hollow.
[00:44:52.185 --> 00:44:54.326]  I mean, I want to feel good about myself.
[00:44:54.346 --> 00:44:57.347]  I want to know that I'm helping humanity.
[00:44:57.707 --> 00:45:02.309]  And, you know, these yuppies think they can just basically poop everywhere.
[00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:03.829]  I hate to use that analogy, but that's what it is.
[00:45:03.849 --> 00:45:05.990]  And then it won't soil their own nest.
[00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.151]  When nobody cares about anybody, everything falls apart.
[00:45:09.612 --> 00:45:10.312]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:18.064]  Well, as I said before, fortunately we don't need 51% of the population to have their head screwed on, right?
[00:45:18.604 --> 00:45:29.091]  If we can just get 3% or even 2% who understand and who are willing to dedicate a significant portion of their lives to this thing, we can recapture the program.
[00:45:29.111 --> 00:45:30.251]  We can turn it around.
[00:45:30.392 --> 00:45:30.652]  I agree.
[00:45:30.672 --> 00:45:32.953]  Let's jam a call and we'll come back and take a bunch of them.
[00:45:33.133 --> 00:45:35.495]  Richard, where are you calling us from today?
[00:45:35.995 --> 00:45:36.795]  Omaha, Nebraska.
[00:45:36.936 --> 00:45:37.416]  Welcome, sir.
[00:45:37.916 --> 00:45:46.025]  Yeah, last night on Educational Network Point of View, they had a special about privatization of prisons.
[00:45:48.394 --> 00:46:12.668]  You know, where they went into detail where corporations are actually, if not taking over some prisons, are actually building their own prisons, and then going to state legislatures to actually, what you call, toughen up on laws just so people can get arrested and imprisoned, and then they hire their own
[00:46:14.649 --> 00:46:20.530]  Sir, sir, sir, a battery in your backyard, speeding, will now be six months a year in prison.
[00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:21.371]  Yeah.
[00:46:21.551 --> 00:46:23.911]  I mean, G. Edward Griffin, you want to comment on that?
[00:46:23.931 --> 00:46:25.111]  And we'll hold you over into the break.
[00:46:25.571 --> 00:46:26.071]  Well, sure.
[00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:38.754]  That's the trend, of course, is to get all of these legitimate functions of government, certainly prisons would be a legitimate function of government, to get it out of the political sphere so that the voters couldn't ever have any chance at reforming it, you know.
[00:46:38.894 --> 00:46:40.555]  And let's be clear, this isn't free market.
[00:46:40.875 --> 00:46:46.920]  We pay the tax money to a private group that just so happens to generally be owned by a money laundering drug cartel.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.541]  And I'm surprised.
[00:46:48.561 --> 00:46:55.406]  Was James Dobson saying this was bad that the prisons go and then lobby for tougher laws to put more of us in their prisons?
[00:46:56.086 --> 00:46:58.088]  Well, I didn't catch that, Alex.
[00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.589]  No, I mean the listener, Richard.
[00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:01.831]  Richard, are you still there?
[00:47:01.931 --> 00:47:02.711]  James Dobson.
[00:47:03.292 --> 00:47:04.753]  I haven't kept up on him lately.
[00:47:05.802 --> 00:47:07.963]  Well, I mean, that's focus on the family you were talking about.
[00:47:07.983 --> 00:47:09.304]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:47:09.804 --> 00:47:13.005]  Richard, I want to continue for InfoWars.com, stream listeners.
[00:47:13.306 --> 00:47:15.166]  We're going to talk during this break so we don't waste time.
[00:47:15.487 --> 00:47:18.528]  With Richard, Angie Aber-Griffin will come back on the other side with everybody else's calls.
[00:47:19.328 --> 00:47:21.870]  It is a big... Okay, I want to continue talking to Richard.
[00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:28.573]  Richard, what program was this where they... I mean, we already knew this year, I'm just telling the audience, we know that that's how it works.
[00:47:28.613 --> 00:47:32.275]  That's why we have more... we have 5% of the world's population, 35% of the world's prison population.
[00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:42.181]  So, there's 5% of the people in the world who live in the U.S., but 35% of the world population in prison is in the U.S., and they're not stopping.
[00:47:42.201 --> 00:47:50.066]  They're just doubling the building, more cops, more laws, arrest you for not turning your blinker on, jail time, I mean, just total control.
[00:47:50.886 --> 00:47:52.127]  This is the predatory system.
[00:47:52.227 --> 00:48:04.996]  What show was this again, where they admitted that the private prisons go lobby for tougher laws to put us, the slaves, in their prisons for 20 cents an hour, building widgets that then take everybody else's jobs?
[00:48:05.757 --> 00:48:13.991]  Point of view on an educational network channel and they actually repeated it twice last night.
[00:48:15.133 --> 00:48:19.039]  Okay, so that's another show with the name Point of View not related to James Dobson.
[00:48:19.898 --> 00:48:20.358]  Uh, no.
[00:48:20.478 --> 00:48:21.019]  No, no, no, no.
[00:48:21.039 --> 00:48:24.020]  Okay, so were they saying that it was bad?
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.341]  I'm surprised that was on TV.
[00:48:26.001 --> 00:48:47.232]  Uh, well, they just went into detail about it, and they pointed it out that, uh, yes, they made the implement, what you call implement, or inclination that it was getting bad when people are being hired to actually privatize
[00:48:48.152 --> 00:48:48.772]  How do you call it?
[00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:54.775]  They privatized their own guards and they've actually even gotten old prisons to go over.
[00:48:55.736 --> 00:48:56.156]  Amazing.
[00:48:56.196 --> 00:48:56.916]  I appreciate your call.
[00:48:57.096 --> 00:48:57.737]  I was aware of that.
[00:48:57.757 --> 00:48:59.838]  I'm just surprised it's on television.
[00:48:59.878 --> 00:49:01.879]  A classic example of that is Tulia, Texas.
[00:49:02.559 --> 00:49:09.482]  58 black people, no criminal record, no drugs found, were just randomly arrested and put in the local prison.
[00:49:09.502 --> 00:49:12.684]  That's the only job in the panhandle of West Texas in that town.
[00:49:13.624 --> 00:49:20.406]  And, uh, they later came out, they just said, hey, we gotta have people in the prison, so we just put the blacks in there so we all have jobs.
[00:49:20.946 --> 00:49:26.067]  I mean, that's really where this is going, and one in ten college grads is now going to be Homeland Security related.
[00:49:26.427 --> 00:49:39.270]  I mean, you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning or being killed by a deer jumping out in front of your car, but we've got to give up our whole life and no Bill of Rights and have the government run our life, and everybody's got to go live in prison to keep us safe from Al-Qaeda, Jim Griffin.
[00:49:39.971 --> 00:49:41.353]  Yes, well you've got the story.
[00:49:41.393 --> 00:49:44.459]  This all was predicted more or less by Orwell in 1984.
[00:49:44.499 --> 00:49:45.601]  Remember that section where the
[00:49:51.457 --> 00:49:56.120]  I can't think of the name of the conspirator, but he was speaking to Winston.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:56.760]  O'Brien.
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.581]  O'Brien, thank you, yes.
[00:49:58.641 --> 00:50:04.064]  And he said, Winston, don't you know we don't have laws to keep law and order?
[00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:08.287]  We have laws, so many of them, so that nobody can avoid breaking the law.
[00:50:08.707 --> 00:50:12.169]  We need to have everybody a criminal so that we can control them.
[00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:14.611]  We can put anybody in prison any time we wish.
[00:50:15.411 --> 00:50:16.032]  And so forth.
[00:50:16.072 --> 00:50:17.853]  Make that point, make that point to the main audience.
[00:50:17.873 --> 00:50:18.173]  Here we go.
[00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:24.765]  Here's the deal.
[00:50:24.785 --> 00:50:26.426]  We're going to go 20 minutes into overdrive.
[00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:48.255]  We're going to go to Ray and Scott, but Abraham, Robert, I want to give you guys a local number.
[00:50:48.296 --> 00:50:49.156]  We'll go to you first.
[00:50:49.177 --> 00:50:49.217]  512-646-5400.
[00:50:49.317 --> 00:50:51.019]  We'll be turning that system on in about five minutes.
[00:50:51.419 --> 00:50:52.080]  That's, of course, 512-646-5400.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.842]  In fact, you're welcome to call in on that right now.
[00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:09.918]  But you were making a point in the behind-the-scenes interview we were just doing for the InfoWars streams that everybody needs to tune to now.
[00:51:10.238 --> 00:51:12.099]  We won't be on the AM or FM or shortwave.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.864]  The satellite will just be at InfoWars.com with the audio and PrisonPlanet.tv with the video.
[00:51:18.224 --> 00:51:19.926]  Would you ever grip him for another 20 minutes or so?
[00:51:19.966 --> 00:51:21.227]  We really appreciate him doing that.
[00:51:21.607 --> 00:51:25.450]  You were making the point about how, yeah, the private prisons are lobbying.
[00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:26.952]  That was just in the news the other day.
[00:51:27.452 --> 00:51:34.837]  I'm surprised it's on TV now, that they come and lobby and say, we need more people in prison, because we've got private prisons we've opened, we need to fill them.
[00:51:35.618 --> 00:51:42.103]  And so now we see people being arrested for no turn signal, no seatbelt, kids being CPS'd for the smallest of things.
[00:51:43.104 --> 00:51:47.727]  I mean, there's millions of new police and bureaucrats, and they're going to find terrorists.
[00:51:48.127 --> 00:51:51.930]  And you talked about O'Brien torturing Winston, saying, hey, this isn't for criminals.
[00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:52.851]  Can you recap that?
[00:51:54.538 --> 00:52:09.303]  Yeah, in 1984, that book, 1984, by George Orwell, the point was made so well, O'Brien is the master criminal, he's working for the government, and he's torturing Winston, who is the good guy, and he's explaining the way that life really is.
[00:52:09.343 --> 00:52:11.964]  He says, Winston, come on, wake up, be real.
[00:52:12.024 --> 00:52:13.544]  This is the real world you're living in.
[00:52:13.584 --> 00:52:20.466]  And he says, you don't think we have laws in order to keep law in order or to enforce justice, do you?
[00:52:20.886 --> 00:52:21.566]  No, no, no.
[00:52:21.606 --> 00:52:23.147]  He says, Winston, come on, wake up.
[00:52:23.587 --> 00:52:29.709]  We have so many laws, we have so many of them that it's impossible not to break laws, no matter what you do.
[00:52:29.749 --> 00:52:35.030]  If you get up in the morning, you probably have broken five laws before you brush your teeth.
[00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:48.634]  The purpose of having so many laws is so that everybody becomes a criminal, and now we have a reason for arresting anyone, and we can control people because they're all criminals.
[00:52:49.358 --> 00:52:53.743]  And I think that's the idea, that we're seeing it unfold right now in our lives today.
[00:52:53.783 --> 00:52:55.846]  I saw something on the internet last night.
[00:52:56.266 --> 00:53:05.437]  Some poor bloke in the UK got arrested and he spent 18 hours in prison for dropping an apple core on the ground.
[00:53:07.028 --> 00:53:08.069]  That's what it's all about.
[00:53:08.149 --> 00:53:15.335]  It's all about getting total control, getting you in the system, and I think even a lot of police now realize and know this.
[00:53:15.875 --> 00:53:33.109]  I mean, every Roydhead I've seen at the gym, now I see his officers strutting down the street with, you know, deviled skulls tattooed all over them, just smiling with satanic pleasure that this is their time, I guess, and every town's going to have ne'er-do-well goons in black uniforms.
[00:53:34.049 --> 00:53:37.452]  In fact, next hour I want to tell you the story briefly and then we'll go back to the calls.
[00:53:38.773 --> 00:53:53.204]  So for all the callers, Ray, Ann, Scott and everybody else, just Abraham, Robert, call in right now at 512-646-5400 and you'll go to the head of the line for those callers that we're holding on Genesis lines.
[00:53:53.644 --> 00:53:56.446]  And I want to thank the network for the great job and all the affiliates and everything they do.
[00:53:57.627 --> 00:54:01.369]  But I have the footage of FEMA and Road to Tyranny saying the Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[00:54:01.409 --> 00:54:07.993]  I have the FBI training manuals with their phone numbers on it saying the Constitution's bad, people that talk about it are terrorists.
[00:54:08.533 --> 00:54:14.997]  And I have police squad car video where they arrest people for having pocket constitutions and state police stand there going, I think this is illegal.
[00:54:15.797 --> 00:54:22.121]  But at a Christian school in Texas, a major university, they said, you're not allowed to say the Bill of Rights and Constitution is good.
[00:54:22.421 --> 00:54:23.822]  It's now a terrorist document.
[00:54:24.462 --> 00:54:27.384]  I mean, it's so over the top.
[00:54:27.444 --> 00:54:28.705]  And I interviewed those guys.
[00:54:28.745 --> 00:54:30.686]  That rebroadcast is coming up in 20 minutes.
[00:54:31.466 --> 00:54:33.928]  But we're going to end the main network transmission now.
[00:54:33.948 --> 00:54:35.369]  We'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:54:36.409 --> 00:54:36.810]  3 p.m.
[00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:50.780]  But if you want to hear these other calls and more from G. Edward Griffin, you'll want to go like tens of thousands of people are doing right now and listen at InfoWars.com on those streams and those streams alone or you can watch us at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:54:51.181 --> 00:54:57.746]  We'll be right back on the other side in overdrive with G. Edward Griffin at InfoWars.com.
[00:55:00.001 --> 00:55:01.624]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:55:01.884 --> 00:55:03.126]  Okay, John, great job.
[00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:03.867]  Thanks for everything.
[00:55:04.048 --> 00:55:04.568]  Thank you, sir.
[00:55:04.588 --> 00:55:05.270]  We'll see you again tomorrow.
[00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:05.991]  I forgot.
[00:55:06.351 --> 00:55:07.112]  I am... Yes, sir?
[00:55:07.353 --> 00:55:11.219]  The phone number to G. Edward Griffin to... Okay, we've got Griffin online.
[00:55:11.259 --> 00:55:11.539]  Thank you.
[00:55:19.684 --> 00:55:20.184]  We're good to go.
[00:55:54.177 --> 00:55:57.239]  Okay, folks, we're back live into Overdrive.
[00:55:57.259 --> 00:56:02.282]  Got G. Edward Griffin joining us for another 20 minutes to take your phone calls.
[00:56:02.842 --> 00:56:12.488]  Got a picture of him and the late, great Aaron Russo up on the computer screen for everybody that's watching via PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[00:56:14.381 --> 00:56:18.803]  And we're going to go back to Mr. Griffin here in just one moment.
[00:56:19.483 --> 00:56:24.805]  And I promise I'll get to all of those that are currently holding right now.
[00:56:25.826 --> 00:56:27.987]  Going back to G. Edward Griffin.
[00:56:28.007 --> 00:56:37.791]  G. Edward Griffin, before we take five final phone calls and let you go, any other key points, any other areas that you want to get into that we haven't covered or gone over so far?
[00:56:39.155 --> 00:56:53.338]  Well, I don't know that there are key points that we haven't covered, but I always feel, Alex, that it's necessary to talk about solutions whenever we talk about these problems, because otherwise it can seem so overwhelming.
[00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:58.900]  Do we have time for a two-minute seminar on apathy?
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.040]  Yes, please do.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:02.121]  I'd like to give you my two-minute seminar on apathy.
[00:57:02.301 --> 00:57:03.001]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[00:57:04.062 --> 00:57:14.272]  When I was first trying to spread the word on some of these issues years and years ago, I used to be amazed at how apathetic my friends were.
[00:57:14.912 --> 00:57:21.758]  They just would look at me, their eyes would get glazed, they'd roll and they'd look off into space and I'd say, what's the matter with these people?
[00:57:21.778 --> 00:57:23.020]  They don't want to hear about the truth.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:24.781]  How apathetic can you get?
[00:57:25.822 --> 00:57:29.726]  And then one day I realized that the problem was me and not them.
[00:57:30.347 --> 00:57:52.556]  And the reason I say that is because if you can imagine that you're lying in a rubber raft and you're out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you're all alone and you look over the edge and you see little bubbles coming up over the edge and you realize that there is a leak in the raft and you go, uh-oh, this raft is going down and you can sense that it's getting limper and limper.
[00:57:53.317 --> 00:57:53.917]  What are you going to do?
[00:57:54.897 --> 00:57:56.118]  Well, you're going to do nothing.
[00:57:56.138 --> 00:57:58.619]  You're going to just lie there and sink.
[00:57:59.355 --> 00:58:00.597]  Because there's nothing you can do.
[00:58:01.518 --> 00:58:13.495]  But if you change the scenario, and you look around the raft, and you see an air pump, and a place to screw it in, and you pump air back into the raft, all of a sudden, you're not just lying there apathetic,
[00:58:14.429 --> 00:58:15.250]  You're pumping away.
[00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:17.531]  You're Mr. Activism from top to bottom.
[00:58:18.011 --> 00:58:21.454]  And you'll be pumping away for as long as you have any energy left to do it.
[00:58:21.954 --> 00:58:30.980]  And the only difference between those two scenarios is that in the first case there was nothing you could do about it, and in the second case at least there was something that you could do.
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:35.463]  And I realized that when I was presenting all of these problems to my friends,
[00:58:36.284 --> 00:58:42.050]  I was making such a good case that I had convinced them that there was nothing that could be done to change it.
[00:58:42.391 --> 00:58:47.016]  And so I was creating the very apathy in them that was annoying me.
[00:58:47.927 --> 00:58:57.514]  And so from that point forward, I've always thought to myself, please, please, Edward, when you're talking about problems, you better have a solution, or else you're just going to create apathy.
[00:58:57.615 --> 00:58:58.555]  Well, I know this.
[00:58:58.855 --> 00:59:00.156]  We can't affect change.
[00:59:00.217 --> 00:59:02.478]  Being involved in fighting tyranny is fine.
[00:59:02.879 --> 00:59:04.720]  You meet the best people in society.
[00:59:06.081 --> 00:59:09.604]  You were designed as a human to try to help your tribe, help your culture.
[00:59:10.044 --> 00:59:14.467]  You're designed to be free, to be involved in the animating contest of liberty.
[00:59:15.448 --> 00:59:20.053]  And so, I want people to know, A, you don't have a choice.
[00:59:20.093 --> 00:59:21.214]  The new old order's coming for you.
[00:59:21.234 --> 00:59:22.295]  They've already gotten most of you.
[00:59:22.336 --> 00:59:23.156]  You better fight back.
[00:59:23.637 --> 00:59:25.259]  And B, this is what life's all about.
[00:59:25.739 --> 00:59:28.902]  I mean, people who are wealthy, successful, many of them aren't empowered.
[00:59:28.942 --> 00:59:29.743]  They don't feel good.
[00:59:29.763 --> 00:59:30.384]  They're unhappy.
[00:59:30.404 --> 00:59:30.844]  They're empty.
[00:59:31.105 --> 00:59:31.986]  They're looking for something.
[00:59:32.606 --> 00:59:41.136]  I assure you, you start fighting tyranny, you start investigating evil, you start confronting evil, you're going to be so alive that you're almost going to be exploding.
[00:59:41.816 --> 00:59:50.926]  And I hate to say that, but I am driven, I am obsessed, I am electric, I am a volcano, and I wasn't like this before I found out.
[00:59:51.647 --> 00:59:55.610]  With an evil group, was doing all these horrible things, and I didn't control my life.
[00:59:56.051 --> 01:00:01.936]  Now I do to a certain extent, because at least I'm fighting back, and I've seen thousands of victories we've had against them.
[01:00:01.996 --> 01:00:06.500]  So, really, people are missing out on this animating contest.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.641]  I mean, who wants to be in the bleachers?
[01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:14.046]  I mean, I want to be down like the gladiator in the contest, G. Edward Griffin.
[01:00:14.246 --> 01:00:17.688]  Well, that's exactly right, and that's because you have the vision of victory.
[01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:19.589]  You actually see that in your mind.
[01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:20.770]  You're creating that vision.
[01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.892]  You know that you can win, or be part of that movement.
[01:00:24.492 --> 01:00:27.934]  And so that's what invigorates you, and I'm in the same category.
[01:00:27.974 --> 01:00:29.895]  Well, I'd say that's half of it.
[01:00:29.915 --> 01:00:30.356]  You're right.
[01:00:30.576 --> 01:00:33.077]  The other half is, I realize these people mean business.
[01:00:33.718 --> 01:00:36.119]  These people killed 200 million people last century.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.040]  Right.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.421]  You don't have any choice, really.
[01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:38.921]  Yeah.
[01:00:40.978 --> 01:00:48.530]  My Aunt Alice who raised me used to say, I have the courage to fight, but I am too cowardly to surrender.
[01:00:49.969 --> 01:00:50.689]  Well, exactly.
[01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:55.792]  People always say, Alex, you have such courage, and Jebra Griffin has such courage, and Ron Paul has such courage.
[01:00:56.673 --> 01:01:00.755]  Ladies and gentlemen, it would take mindless, blind, insane courage.
[01:01:01.255 --> 01:01:03.376]  I mean, you use the analogy of the life raft.
[01:01:03.396 --> 01:01:07.839]  It's like I'm in a room with water raising, pouring in out of holes.
[01:01:07.879 --> 01:01:10.260]  I'd better find an exit out of here.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.681]  You'd better find the courage to fight.
[01:01:12.601 --> 01:01:13.442]  And that's it.
[01:01:14.823 --> 01:01:19.646]  So the problem, though, is that we have to show people that there is some chance.
[01:01:19.866 --> 01:01:21.207]  There is something we can do.
[01:01:21.667 --> 01:01:22.388]  And you know, there is.
[01:01:22.468 --> 01:01:23.669]  It's not just make-believe.
[01:01:23.729 --> 01:01:29.273]  It's not the let's figure out something and pump some sunshine into people and say things that aren't true.
[01:01:30.614 --> 01:01:41.860]  I really at one point felt that it was pretty hopeless, that it was going to take a miracle, but now I think maybe the miracle is happening and hopefully I'm a part of it, and maybe I'm one of the ways in which it can be implemented.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:49.924]  But I don't want to overly keep talking about Freedom Force, but that's my passion, because I see Freedom Force as the solution.
[01:01:50.724 --> 01:01:55.227]  And I'm so enthused over it now, I can hardly contain myself.
[01:01:56.155 --> 01:02:00.777]  It's not going to happen necessarily in my lifetime, but it's going to happen, and that's the important thing.
[01:02:01.337 --> 01:02:25.165]  And you know, when you can go to bed at night and you think, my gosh, we've set in motion something that is going to return this world to a condition of freedom and prosperity and happiness, and you had a role in that, and you had a role in overcoming this great evil, it just puts a smile on your face, and you can go to sleep and relax.
[01:02:25.345 --> 01:02:51.018]  Well, I agree with you, and I want to give out some web addresses here in a moment, and we have links to them, of course, all day up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, but I also have this sense of my ancestors, and I know the incredible struggles they went through, and when you read what they said, and I don't just mean what the Founding Fathers said, or people in the Magna Carta said, or others that came before against tyranny, even more modern times like Gandhi,
[01:02:51.778 --> 01:02:51.838]  Yes.
[01:03:06.835 --> 01:03:08.096]  And people have that sense.
[01:03:08.116 --> 01:03:13.179]  And the globalists try to create a counterfeit of that and say, you know, whatever helps the many, forget the few.
[01:03:13.219 --> 01:03:13.800]  It's the opposite.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.801]  When you help the few, you help the many.
[01:03:16.882 --> 01:03:18.383]  And you know, the government doesn't direct it.
[01:03:18.463 --> 01:03:22.766]  You individually direct it where you're in control of your community and there really is a community.
[01:03:23.026 --> 01:03:25.207]  And that's why I support what you're doing over at Freedom Force.
[01:03:25.828 --> 01:03:27.189]  Give them that Freedom Force website.
[01:03:27.967 --> 01:03:31.029]  Yes, it's FreedomForceInternational.org.
[01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:32.030]  Big, long word.
[01:03:32.411 --> 01:03:34.372]  FreedomForceInternational.org.
[01:03:34.472 --> 01:03:35.553]  And they can find out more there.
[01:03:35.613 --> 01:03:42.639]  Now, I want to talk about, briefly, and then we'll go to the calls, the Church Committee, because you interviewed some of the folks involved with that.
[01:03:42.679 --> 01:03:56.310]  You interviewed some of the people in Congress who were the head staffers over investigating the tax-free foundations, and you really helped get some instrumental info out before this fellow died, not just from the Congressional record that we know,
[01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.451]  Why don't you talk about what the foundations do?
[01:03:58.511 --> 01:04:05.496]  Because just last week, Rex Tillerson is in trouble at ExxonMobil, because he won't go along with the global carbon tax.
[01:04:05.836 --> 01:04:11.560]  And the Rockefeller family, they admitted, owns that and most of the other oil companies here in the United States and globally.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.502]  And it came back up that their private foundations own it, but that's secret.
[01:04:15.802 --> 01:04:17.764]  We can't know how much money they have.
[01:04:17.804 --> 01:04:25.589]  And the fact from my studies that the 1906 trust-busting was really, please don't throw me in the briar patch, just like the Federal Reserve folks put out
[01:04:26.049 --> 01:04:31.391]  Well yes, I had the good fortune some years ago to interview Mr. Norman Dodd before he passed away shortly after the interview.
[01:04:31.511 --> 01:04:34.312]  And Norman Dodd had been the Chief Investigator for the Reese Committee.
[01:04:56.421 --> 01:04:57.742]  Shortly after World War II.
[01:04:58.863 --> 01:05:09.233]  And the purpose of the Reese Committee was to investigate the tax-exempt foundations in the United States because there was a lot of concern over what these foundations were funding.
[01:05:09.313 --> 01:05:20.204]  They seemed to be funding organizations and movements and textbooks and things like that were absolutely contrary to the principles that made America great.
[01:05:21.139 --> 01:05:33.744]  And they seem to be very un-American in the sense that they were advocating change in the American culture, in the American political system, to be brought about by other than constitutional means.
[01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:39.147]  They seem to be funding things that were going to subvert the Constitution and so forth.
[01:05:39.187 --> 01:05:44.909]  So the job was to investigate these committees, and Dodd was the chief investigator.
[01:05:44.949 --> 01:05:48.631]  Well, to make a long story short, I had a chance to interview Dodd on camera,
[01:05:49.471 --> 01:05:55.136]  And we have it now at one of the videos that's available on The Reality Zone.
[01:05:55.196 --> 01:05:56.898]  It's called The Hidden Agenda.
[01:05:57.779 --> 01:06:14.333]  And Dodd revealed the fact that when he talked to the heads of these largest foundations, people like the, you know, the organizations like the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment Fund for International Peace, and those groups, he found that they had an agenda
[01:06:14.873 --> 01:06:43.882]  Which had nothing to do with philanthropy, but in fact it was an agenda to change the thinking of the American people over a period of time by capturing the educational system and by capturing control of government to change the American system away from its traditional roots of a constitutional republic and to convert it into a democracy in which the majority would rule with absolutely no restrictions whatsoever
[01:06:45.203 --> 01:06:48.085]  And I want to play a second from the film, The Hidden Agenda for World Government.
[01:06:48.726 --> 01:06:49.627]  Yes?
[01:06:49.707 --> 01:06:53.210]  With you introducing it, here in just a few minutes, but go ahead.
[01:06:53.310 --> 01:07:09.504]  Okay, well anyway, the object of this whole thing, according to one of these men, who is Mr. Gaither from the Ford Foundation, he said, our objective is to sort of change life in the United States so it could be comfortably merged with the Soviet Union.
[01:07:10.137 --> 01:07:11.298]  And that's a direct quote.
[01:07:11.918 --> 01:07:15.401]  And of course we found out later... Now again, we're not saying Communists run this.
[01:07:15.661 --> 01:07:21.285]  It's bigger than Communists or Nazis or Zionists or Catholics or Easter Bunnies.
[01:07:21.445 --> 01:07:22.445]  Oh, much bigger than that.
[01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:27.709]  Because it's the same global management system over every group and Quigley explains that.
[01:07:27.749 --> 01:07:37.515]  He even talks about in Tragedy and Hope how we, the Patriots, always attack one head of the Hydra and how it's an agenda and how they work through everything.
[01:07:37.535 --> 01:07:38.256]  Can you explain that?
[01:07:38.516 --> 01:07:56.401]  Yes, but what he was really talking about was not that we had to be merged with communism, but we had to be merged with a system like communism, that that meant we had to be merged with systems like fascism and Nazism and communism and all of the totalitarian systems of the world.
[01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:57.621]  It wasn't just that one.
[01:07:57.641 --> 01:07:58.902]  That happened to have been the biggest one.
[01:07:58.922 --> 01:08:04.083]  They call it a fusion of that, and that's why we call it Homeland Security, as they did in Germany, the black uniforms, everything.
[01:08:04.443 --> 01:08:19.033]  So what they were really saying is that America had to give up its traditions of freedom, had to give up its judicial system, its culture, everything, so we could be comfortably merged with all of these totalitarian systems of the world.
[01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:23.916]  And of course, they were talking about the New World Order, but they didn't use those words at that time.
[01:08:23.936 --> 01:08:29.620]  Let's play a minute or two of your introduction of him from the film, if people can get it, Freedom Force International.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:30.560]  Okay.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.301]  But here it is.
[01:08:34.065 --> 01:08:37.167]  I'm playing this off Google Video, by the way.
[01:08:37.207 --> 01:08:38.548]  People should get the DVD of it.
[01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:39.748]  Here you are.
[01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.349]  Here's Introduced by G. Edward Griffin.
[01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:46.132]  The Hidden Agenda for World Government.
[01:08:47.533 --> 01:08:52.295]  The story you are about to hear represents a missing piece in the puzzle of modern history.
[01:08:53.116 --> 01:08:58.259]  Without this knowledge, many contemporary events are simply beyond understanding.
[01:08:59.173 --> 01:09:09.701]  You are about to hear a man tell you that the major tax-exempt foundations of this land, since at least 1945, have been operating to promote a hidden agenda.
[01:09:10.721 --> 01:09:16.245]  And that agenda has nothing to do with the surface appearance of charity, good works, or philanthropy.
[01:09:18.267 --> 01:09:25.232]  This man will tell you that the real objectives include the creation of a worldwide collective estate, including the Soviet Union,
[01:09:25.931 --> 01:09:26.872]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[01:09:26.892 --> 01:09:27.052]  Now, um...
[01:09:37.734 --> 01:09:40.737]  Well, explaining this, they put the hammers and sickles back on.
[01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.220]  They're having the armored convoys again.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.263]  It's basically just the same system over there that it ever was.
[01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:47.284]  Never changed.
[01:09:47.544 --> 01:09:49.566]  But that's what you said 20, 30 years ago.
[01:09:49.606 --> 01:09:56.554]  That's what Dodd said 30 years ago, 40 years ago, is the plan was to merge the two systems, and now they say they've done that.
[01:09:57.386 --> 01:10:00.868]  Well, they've actually progressed quite far, don't you think?
[01:10:00.969 --> 01:10:10.075]  I mean, right now, some of the what they used to call KGB agents and the local police in Russia are training at FBI headquarters.
[01:10:10.635 --> 01:10:12.657]  FBI agents are training in Moscow.
[01:10:13.517 --> 01:10:18.883]  Uh, we exchange, uh, computer information regarding our criminals in both countries.
[01:10:19.624 --> 01:10:28.773]  And, uh, you know, it seems that every day you pick up the newspaper, there's another piece of evidence that the two countries are working... And Russia has always for 70 years...
[01:10:29.734 --> 01:10:32.335]  Train groups of mainly CPS kidnapped children.
[01:10:32.355 --> 01:10:33.375]  They started that over there.
[01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.155]  Hitler did it too.
[01:10:34.175 --> 01:10:35.296]  It's the same system.
[01:10:35.336 --> 01:10:36.656]  National Socialism, Communism.
[01:10:36.676 --> 01:10:38.377]  It's all command and control, black uniforms.
[01:10:38.877 --> 01:10:40.857]  They just give it different names, give you false choices.
[01:10:41.298 --> 01:10:44.259]  Training them how to be Homeland Security, how to beat people up.
[01:10:44.499 --> 01:10:45.479]  And now the U.S.
[01:10:45.539 --> 01:10:51.361]  is converting its schools over to military, I mean public schools, to military academies, Homeland Security schools.
[01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:52.041]  It's the same deal.
[01:10:52.481 --> 01:11:07.151]  Yes, and I think what we need to focus on is that we've got to take that word communism off, take the word Nazism off, take the word neo-conservatives off, and look underneath those labels and you find that beast called collectivism.
[01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:22.181]  That's the same political ideology that's underpinning all of these systems, and that's what Norman Dodd said, that the tax-exempt foundations were determined to create in America with the acceptance of collectivism, and he used that word.
[01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:26.025]  And now that takes us to the full court press.
[01:11:26.105 --> 01:11:36.597]  I mean, the literature that I get from the businesses I work with, like UPS, the TV, the local ads, it's all, the earth is dying, we've got attacks, the wicked carbon dioxide.
[01:11:37.398 --> 01:11:46.502]  Of course, the globals had to choose something that really was needed for the earth, and that humans exhale, that plants breathe, so they could make us the enemy, as Richard Inhofe, the head of the CFR, said.
[01:11:46.522 --> 01:11:53.226]  He said, it's a fraud, it's meant to make us the enemy, so the state can organize operations against free humanity.
[01:11:53.966 --> 01:11:55.067]  And then here's the UPS.
[01:11:56.601 --> 01:12:11.197]  The thing I got mailed today is a UPS customer telling me I've got to go green and that I'm now under the United Nations and it says you were under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an organization established to investigate climate change, its potential impact and options for reducing risk.
[01:12:11.818 --> 01:12:17.380]  And it tells me I've got to ride bikes, and a lot of it sounds reasonable, but it's about getting me used to them being the boss.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:33.104]  They usually have reasonable sounding things up front, again about habitualizing, following their orders, and it goes through saying we have to have a carbon tax, right here, where I'm pointing for viewers out there, and can you speak a few minutes on that, and then we'll go to the calls.
[01:12:33.737 --> 01:12:36.919]  Well, I think your point is well taken again, Alex.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:49.849]  A moment ago we were referring to O'Brien's message to Winston that everybody winds up being a criminal, that there are so many laws that you cannot help literally breathing without
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.923]  Violating a law, and here you just came up with the perfect example.
[01:12:55.263 --> 01:12:57.565]  When we breathe, we exhale CO2.
[01:12:58.166 --> 01:12:59.166]  And now that's a crime.
[01:12:59.647 --> 01:13:01.428]  We have excess CO2, they say.
[01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:07.494]  And we've got to have a one-child policy, as they're all, Ted Turner, Prince Philip, are all saying, and then it's happening.
[01:13:07.794 --> 01:13:13.239]  So there's undoubtedly be some kind of a law that you cannot breathe more than so many cycles per minute.
[01:13:15.426 --> 01:13:18.269]  Otherwise, you'll be upsetting the ecology.
[01:13:18.329 --> 01:13:19.370]  By the way, you're not joking.
[01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:24.095]  The New York Times had a headline last year, a tax on breathing, but went on to say it was good.
[01:13:24.175 --> 01:13:24.575]  Go ahead.
[01:13:24.936 --> 01:13:25.856]  Oh, the tax was good?
[01:13:26.297 --> 01:13:32.223]  Yeah, I mean the headline was shocking, a tax on breathing, but then it said, no, we need a tax on breathing.
[01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:33.044]  Well, of course.
[01:13:33.244 --> 01:13:37.328]  The New York Times is run by collectivists, and of course they want the tax.
[01:13:37.368 --> 01:13:39.090]  They want more than the tax.
[01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:40.351]  Let's get to the point.
[01:13:40.391 --> 01:13:41.132]  It's not the money.
[01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:43.294]  It's the control over the human beings.
[01:13:43.695 --> 01:13:45.276]  That's really behind this agenda.
[01:13:45.556 --> 01:13:47.018]  It's not just the carbon tax.
[01:13:47.378 --> 01:13:50.922]  It's the regulatory agency that administers the carbon tax.
[01:13:51.563 --> 01:13:52.383]  It's the control.
[01:13:52.403 --> 01:13:53.625]  I think that's really the goal.
[01:13:54.617 --> 01:13:55.217]  Absolutely.
[01:13:55.277 --> 01:13:55.738]  Continue.
[01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:58.179]  Well, what more can I say?
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.663]  Well, I mean, how do we... I mean, they've got genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, all these serious things that are hurting the environment.
[01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:11.848]  So it's also perfect for them, because then they only ninny about something that isn't a dangerous gas, that doesn't even really affect them.
[01:14:11.908 --> 01:14:13.469]  They get to tax us, run our lives.
[01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:18.572]  They said they're going to have as many environmentalist enforcers as they now have cops.
[01:14:18.592 --> 01:14:21.114]  That's another two million bureaucrats.
[01:14:21.574 --> 01:14:22.575]  I mean, this is hellish!
[01:14:23.075 --> 01:14:23.295]  Yes.
[01:14:23.655 --> 01:14:34.960]  Well, those who have read The Creature from Jekyll Island, my book on the Federal Reserve, will recall that there's a section in there toward the back in which we analyze a book called The Report from Iron Mountain.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:44.383]  And this was supposedly a report from a think tank that originated near Iron Mountain in New York, I believe it was.
[01:14:44.403 --> 01:14:45.924]  It was a CFR think tank.
[01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:55.150]  There's some question as to whether it's authentic or not, but there's no question regarding the authenticity of the conclusion.
[01:14:55.331 --> 01:15:00.393]  Yeah, everything that's in that document is said separately in other official documents.
[01:15:00.453 --> 01:15:13.678]  Yes, it's quite... you can just hold that document as a template over your daily newspaper and you can see that practically everything in the news fits that template, so you know that it's the real thing.
[01:15:14.438 --> 01:15:16.099]  And part of the template was
[01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:38.540]  These people who drafted the book said we must have a means of frightening people so much that they are willing to surrender their personal freedoms and they're willing to submit to an all-powerful government and be grateful for it because it'll be offered as a means of providing security for these people.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.923]  They said, well, what can we use to establish this kind of condition?
[01:15:43.404 --> 01:15:50.630]  And they came to the conclusion that war was the most effective threat to bring this about.
[01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:55.694]  But along the way they gave very serious consideration to threat to the environment.
[01:15:55.774 --> 01:16:08.344]  And they talked at great length about how the possibility of destruction of the planet and the environmental condition of life might be built up and pumped up to such a magnitude that the people could be scared to death.
[01:16:08.744 --> 01:16:14.386]  About the end of life on this planet, and that might become someday a substitute for the threat of war.
[01:16:15.086 --> 01:16:28.531]  And they talked at great length about how that could psychologically be substituted as a threat for war, and they said, you know, someday when we have our world government, and we no longer have nations, there will no longer be the threat of war between nations.
[01:16:28.831 --> 01:16:30.891]  We gotta find something else other than war.
[01:16:31.331 --> 01:16:35.573]  And maybe, maybe the environmental issue will be just the ticket for us.
[01:16:37.401 --> 01:16:45.667]  And then we have Richard N. Haas in the 1992 and then republished last year by the CFR Club of Rome document, chairman of the CFR.
[01:16:45.947 --> 01:17:04.600]  Have you seen that where he says we'll use the twin rails, one is terrorism to quote wage war on the people, he says that, and then the other rail, and this is public, will be global warming to quote make humanity the enemy and then that will be the organizing thing in society is making ourselves the enemy.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.743]  Well, that's exactly what they were talking about in the report from Iron Mountain.
[01:17:10.044 --> 01:17:18.790]  And when you think about it, terrorism actually has become a good substitute for war because terrorism is not a threat from a nation.
[01:17:19.483 --> 01:17:21.144]  It's a threat from something.
[01:17:21.184 --> 01:17:22.245]  We don't know what it is.
[01:17:22.265 --> 01:17:23.286]  Oh, it's spooky.
[01:17:23.326 --> 01:17:25.248]  We've got to treat everybody like they did it.
[01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:27.550]  Yeah, terrorists can be anybody, anywhere.
[01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:30.132]  You know, so it's no longer a national issue.
[01:17:30.172 --> 01:17:34.896]  So they could have a war on terrorism long after there are no nations left.
[01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:36.857]  And that's perfect for their agenda.
[01:17:37.918 --> 01:17:44.740]  Well, they say, under their global government, now it's going to be rapid reaction forces, basically like 2,000 man SWAT teams.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.620]  They just sat down in cities when we're revolting to kill us.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.101]  And nerve gas planes, knockout planes, that's all been declassified.
[01:17:52.581 --> 01:17:55.682]  It's just the management and the culling and the reducing.
[01:17:56.022 --> 01:17:59.903]  And they say that we're going to struggle and fight back, but they're culling us.
[01:17:59.983 --> 01:18:02.184]  They're willing to make the hard decisions.
[01:18:02.704 --> 01:18:03.704]  And it'll go on forever.
[01:18:04.488 --> 01:18:07.028]  And it'll go on of Boots stomping on the human face forever.
[01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:08.809]  Let's take calls.
[01:18:08.829 --> 01:18:11.549]  First off is Robert in California.
[01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:13.810]  And then we'll go to Abraham and others.
[01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.910]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:15.530]  Thanks for holding.
[01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:16.590]  You're talking to G. Edward Griffin.
[01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:18.110]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:18:19.651 --> 01:18:24.231]  One of the things that I wanted to bring up is two things, actually.
[01:18:24.652 --> 01:18:32.593]  One, we're trying out here in California to get people to run for small central committee offices and help other campaigns because we found out that
[01:18:34.201 --> 01:18:39.745]  If a loser loses this campaign, he still gets to make a certain amount of appointments, depending on how many votes he gets.
[01:18:40.486 --> 01:18:47.231]  And the other winner gets to make eight appointments to the State Central Committee.
[01:18:48.152 --> 01:18:52.675]  You gotta love the name of the different government agencies.
[01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:55.718]  Central Planning Committee, good God, go ahead.
[01:18:56.428 --> 01:19:00.511]  But the thing is, is trying to get people to row in the same direction.
[01:19:00.591 --> 01:19:08.337]  We have a lot of people with their oars in the water, but they seem to be splashing water back into the boat or going in a different direction, so people seem to be spinning their wheels.
[01:19:08.838 --> 01:19:24.049]  Second thing is, like those genetically altered food and stuff, I was watching a documentary called Future of Food, and since they're gene-splicing these things in, if we eat this long enough, are these genes able to enter into our
[01:19:32.415 --> 01:19:41.020]  Well, I'm not an expert on that, but I think that is probably a philosophical question that can become a legal question.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:45.262]  In other words, the courts may inject themselves into that very issue.
[01:19:45.903 --> 01:19:53.907]  And that is very spooky to me because I know that companies like Monsanto and other large agribusiness companies
[01:19:54.727 --> 01:20:00.212]  They have tremendous clout economically, and they do affect the courts.
[01:20:00.272 --> 01:20:09.479]  The courts are passing one decision after another now in favor of Monsanto and other companies, giving them the patented rights on plants and living things.
[01:20:09.579 --> 01:20:23.791]  So I think it's theoretically possible, unless we turn things around and recapture control of our government, including our courts, yeah, these giant corporations could probably influence the courts and pass a decision like that.
[01:20:24.517 --> 01:20:25.337]  Why couldn't they?
[01:20:25.377 --> 01:20:30.259]  If they can control our corn supply, why can't they control our children's supply?
[01:20:30.279 --> 01:20:32.759]  Oh, they've stated it.
[01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:33.780]  I mean, it was the U.S.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:39.821]  and Kissinger under State Department memorandum 200 that got China to adopt their one-child policy.
[01:20:40.522 --> 01:20:42.042]  I appreciate your call, Robert.
[01:20:42.062 --> 01:20:42.742]  Really good point.
[01:20:43.443 --> 01:20:47.824]  Getting back to Homeland Security, and we'll take more calls, G. Edward Griffin.
[01:20:50.276 --> 01:20:51.116]  Homeland Security.
[01:20:51.436 --> 01:21:06.801]  The story is now up on PrisonPlanet.com and we have a bunch of videos and confirmed examples and this training flyer and a bunch of other manuals where they say constitutionalist or terrorist, anyone that talks about the Constitution is a terrorist.
[01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:09.441]  It has the phone number to the FBI on it.
[01:21:09.461 --> 01:21:14.463]  I'm going to put that up on the PrisonPlanet.tv screen for people that are
[01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:16.806]  Watching that right now.
[01:21:16.826 --> 01:21:18.047]  I'm going to even zoom in on the number.
[01:21:18.087 --> 01:21:20.467]  If people want to call the FBI, go ahead.
[01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:21.467]  This isn't a joke.
[01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:24.988]  Report anybody that talks about the Constitution.
[01:21:25.028 --> 01:21:29.689]  We have video of police arresting people for pocket constitutions in the article.
[01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:31.370]  This is not satire.
[01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:32.990]  I'm not joking around here.
[01:21:33.650 --> 01:21:40.212]  For listeners that just now tuned in, this individual at East Texas Bible College, the largest in Texas,
[01:21:41.813 --> 01:21:43.995]  He's given us his full name, all the documentation.
[01:21:44.035 --> 01:21:45.396]  He's basically given the full story.
[01:21:45.737 --> 01:21:48.840]  We haven't put out his full name on air yet, though we gave his friend's name out.
[01:21:49.881 --> 01:21:51.182]  He works in the administration.
[01:21:51.222 --> 01:21:52.303]  He's getting a doctorate there.
[01:21:52.323 --> 01:21:53.644]  He's already a pastor in the town.
[01:21:54.405 --> 01:21:56.467]  He was tasked with giving the Boy Scouts a tour.
[01:21:57.048 --> 01:22:01.012]  He was outside in the gazebo and he said, you know, always defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:22:01.032 --> 01:22:02.273]  It wasn't even a radical speech.
[01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:04.675]  He said that's what he was taught in the Boy Scouts himself.
[01:22:05.516 --> 01:22:12.485]  And Homeland Security showed up in a black suit and a gray suit and black ties and said, we won't even tell you who we are.
[01:22:12.505 --> 01:22:16.530]  They had state police with them and the president of the university.
[01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:21.576]  And they said, we will arrest you for terrorism if you ever teach the Constitution again.
[01:22:21.596 --> 01:22:24.760]  Do you feel like you want to comment on that?
[01:22:26.707 --> 01:22:30.670]  Well, there's only one word that I can think of, and it's probably not a polite word.
[01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:40.496]  I think it's symptomatic of where our country has gone, and we've got to save it.
[01:22:41.797 --> 01:22:43.538]  You can't even comment on something like that.
[01:22:44.523 --> 01:22:47.185]  The first question people want to know is, is it for real?
[01:22:47.285 --> 01:22:49.007]  And you've already said, yes, this is for real.
[01:22:49.347 --> 01:22:50.108]  This is not a joke.
[01:22:50.188 --> 01:22:51.769]  This is not even an exception.
[01:22:51.809 --> 01:22:54.852]  This is not some little guy that misunderstood.
[01:22:55.052 --> 01:22:56.593]  I have squad car video.
[01:22:56.613 --> 01:22:57.694]  We're at a checkpoint.
[01:22:58.275 --> 01:22:59.476]  They're stopping all the cars.
[01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:00.096]  They come over.
[01:23:00.156 --> 01:23:01.337]  They say, we want to search you.
[01:23:01.397 --> 01:23:02.999]  She says, I have a Fourth Amendment.
[01:23:03.019 --> 01:23:03.940]  You're stopping everybody.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:04.680]  You can't do that.
[01:23:05.161 --> 01:23:06.161]  And she's a naval veteran.
[01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.603]  And then they pull her out of the car.
[01:23:07.663 --> 01:23:09.044]  They find a pocket Constitution.
[01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:11.366]  And on tape, they say, well, we better arrest her.
[01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:12.267]  This is illegal.
[01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:19.049]  I mean, how did a cop get to the point of thinking a Constitution was illegal when they swore an oath to it?
[01:23:19.069 --> 01:23:21.429]  I mean, this is... it's Twilight Zone!
[01:23:21.449 --> 01:23:23.170]  I mean, it really is Twilight Zone!
[01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:26.011]  Do they still swear an oath to the Constitution?
[01:23:26.051 --> 01:23:26.411]  I wonder.
[01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:27.371]  Yes, they do.
[01:23:27.751 --> 01:23:29.512]  Well, most of them actually don't do their oath now.
[01:23:29.532 --> 01:23:30.372]  That's been admitted, yeah.
[01:23:31.417 --> 01:23:44.923]  Well, all I know is that most of the police have been subjected to at least one and, in many cases, several seminars where they are all assembled in a big room and somebody comes in from Washington, D.C.
[01:23:45.483 --> 01:23:56.828]  and instructs them, gives them profiles on what to look for for terrorists and the kinds of things that they say and where they go and what, you know, what websites they look at.
[01:23:56.868 --> 01:24:00.230]  I'm sure your website is on the list, as is ours.
[01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:09.976]  Oh, they've shown Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth in Congress and said, this is a terror group, and we need to ban these... I mean, in Congress they're saying ban free speech.
[01:24:10.356 --> 01:24:10.516]  Yes.
[01:24:10.936 --> 01:24:11.697]  So there you have it.
[01:24:12.057 --> 01:24:13.238]  That's the dilemma.
[01:24:13.718 --> 01:24:16.700]  That's where we are, and it's getting worse, so what are we going to do about it?
[01:24:17.099 --> 01:24:21.321]  Well, Freedom Force International and a lot of other attack salvos we've got in the Info War.
[01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:26.204]  In fact, up on screen I'm going to put the PrisonPlanet.com article.
[01:24:26.224 --> 01:24:27.544]  This needs to get out to everybody.
[01:24:27.905 --> 01:24:31.887]  And you talked about the seminars they give police.
[01:24:31.907 --> 01:24:43.713]  I actually have a clip of FEMA before 9-11, this was on 720-2001, teaching the huge classroom of cops that the Founding Fathers were evil terrorists.
[01:24:44.718 --> 01:24:46.219]  The Founding Fathers were evil terrorists.
[01:24:46.359 --> 01:24:48.540]  How about I just play that right now?
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.900]  Here, here, let's just play a second of it.
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:51.441]  This is from my film Road to Tyranny.
[01:24:54.202 --> 01:25:00.385]  One of my listeners in Missouri... Man, for some reason this... Patriotic firefighter sent us this footage... Yeah, I'm gonna start it over.
[01:25:00.825 --> 01:25:01.125]  Here we go.
[01:25:01.726 --> 01:25:10.950]  One of my listeners in Missouri, a patriotic firefighter, sent us this footage of a FEMA commando demonizing the Founding Fathers and Christians to a group of police and firefighters.
[01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.490]  What are Christians and Patriots?
[01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:13.411]  The new Jews?
[01:25:15.454 --> 01:25:19.275]  You're damn right, because think about the Christians, okay?
[01:25:19.435 --> 01:25:21.396]  Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
[01:25:21.416 --> 01:25:21.596]  No.
[01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:22.196]  What did they do?
[01:25:22.216 --> 01:25:23.317]  They took your head off!
[01:25:24.017 --> 01:25:26.978]  They beheaded you if you didn't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.
[01:25:27.338 --> 01:25:28.439]  See, this is reality.
[01:25:29.479 --> 01:25:33.680]  Yeah, they're terrorists, but the bottom line is to them, they are not!
[01:25:34.381 --> 01:25:36.181]  Now, why is that important to understand?
[01:25:36.221 --> 01:25:40.783]  Because they are as committed to their cause and to their way of life as you are yours.
[01:25:42.436 --> 01:25:45.057]  And they see you as being wrong.
[01:25:49.077 --> 01:25:49.997]  That's very difficult.
[01:25:50.057 --> 01:25:54.678]  When people are passionate about what they believe in, they become a very difficult enemy to beat.
[01:25:55.078 --> 01:26:00.799]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[01:26:00.839 --> 01:26:01.180]  Who?
[01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:02.140]  Stanley Bob.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.420]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:04.960]  Oh yes.
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:07.521]  You mean, uh, George Washington?
[01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:07.881]  Oh yes.
[01:26:08.041 --> 01:26:08.761]  Martin Garrix?
[01:26:08.901 --> 01:26:09.041]  Yes.
[01:26:09.841 --> 01:26:13.543]  These guys right here, let me ask you something.
[01:26:13.563 --> 01:26:17.404]  Did they try to scare people?
[01:26:17.444 --> 01:26:19.325]  They tried to intimidate the British.
[01:26:19.365 --> 01:26:20.806]  Did they use acts of violence?
[01:26:21.106 --> 01:26:30.529]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials because they systematically had British officials assassinated.
[01:26:31.090 --> 01:26:31.870]  Assassinated.
[01:26:33.519 --> 01:26:53.084]  The guys who we call our founding fathers, George Washington, Mr. Honest, who cut down the cherry tree in Mizzou, is the same guy who signed death orders, if you will, on members of the British government, the British Crown, who they wanted to eliminate because politically they had influence in certain pockets of the United States at that time in the 13th century.
[01:26:53.584 --> 01:27:22.806]  Okay, so it goes on and on from there, and then we have footage of the police, they pull Abby Newman over, they find the Constitution, and they freak out, and they go, we got contraband, and they go, I can't believe it, I can't believe she's, and they start going, oh, I can't believe she's got one, and it's like they found, like, child pornography or something, it's a pocket Constitution, which we give out, by the way, free with all our video and book orders on the website, because we're evil, and they're just going, oh my gosh, I can't believe it,
[01:27:26.128 --> 01:27:29.730]  How do they get the state police, you think, to be so afraid of the Constitution, sir?
[01:27:30.431 --> 01:27:34.253]  Well, I think that it's because they attended seminars, just like you were playing there.
[01:27:34.393 --> 01:27:35.594]  But they're, I mean, idiots!
[01:27:35.634 --> 01:27:38.916]  How do they not know that that's what Old Glory symbolizes?
[01:27:39.096 --> 01:27:40.197]  They swear an oath to that.
[01:27:40.577 --> 01:27:47.542]  Well, remember what we talked about a few minutes ago about how people will sell their souls and their brains and their conscience for a paycheck?
[01:27:49.048 --> 01:27:51.029]  Well, I don't think the police are any different.
[01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:57.092]  It used to be, you know, police went into the police force to defend their friends and neighbors.
[01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.793]  And now I think the motive is a little bit different.
[01:27:59.833 --> 01:28:00.693]  It's a good job.
[01:28:01.233 --> 01:28:02.774]  Everybody else is getting laid off.
[01:28:03.094 --> 01:28:03.955]  This is good pay.
[01:28:04.035 --> 01:28:05.655]  No matter what happens, they're going to get paid.
[01:28:06.336 --> 01:28:12.879]  And besides that, as long as you've got that badge or police identification in your wallet, you'll never get a speeding ticket.
[01:28:13.439 --> 01:28:15.980]  You're one of us instead of one of them, you know?
[01:28:16.781 --> 01:28:19.723]  It becomes almost like they're on the inside now.
[01:28:19.943 --> 01:28:20.703]  They've got it made.
[01:28:21.244 --> 01:28:21.784]  Exactly.
[01:28:21.924 --> 01:28:23.625]  And the fear in the back of their mind.
[01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:27.587]  They know it's tyranny so they go, I better stay on the winning team.
[01:28:27.627 --> 01:28:28.447]  That's exactly it.
[01:28:28.467 --> 01:28:31.909]  A lot of these guys are coming back from overseas.
[01:28:32.289 --> 01:28:34.671]  They've seen some very bad action.
[01:28:35.451 --> 01:28:41.633]  You know, the idea of controlling civilian population over there is that every civilian is a potential enemy.
[01:28:42.093 --> 01:28:46.415]  So they've already got the mindset to come back here, and they sign up for the police.
[01:28:46.575 --> 01:28:47.935]  It's just more of the same.
[01:28:48.235 --> 01:28:48.535]  I agree.
[01:28:48.555 --> 01:28:49.816]  Let's blast through the calls now.
[01:28:49.876 --> 01:28:55.777]  I'm out of control, keeping Gilbert Griffin too long, and I've got a lot of work to do and a short time to get there as well.
[01:28:56.178 --> 01:28:57.898]  Abraham in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:28:57.938 --> 01:28:58.538]  Thanks for holding.
[01:28:59.379 --> 01:29:00.079]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:29:00.199 --> 01:29:00.399]  Hi.
[01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:15.502]  I just wanted to touch on, it's kind of off topic, but I saw on your website today the C-51 in Canada that just hit their floor trying to ban national health care products and they changed the word drug to therapeutic products.
[01:29:15.542 --> 01:29:17.382]  This is scary, like what are we supposed to do?
[01:29:17.402 --> 01:29:20.403]  Hey, they're coming for your vitamins, they're coming for your kids.
[01:29:20.663 --> 01:29:22.444]  Look, government is not reason.
[01:29:23.404 --> 01:29:28.105]  It is not eloquence, just like George Washington said, just like Jebra Griffin said last time.
[01:29:28.225 --> 01:29:34.386]  It is a very dangerous servant, and a horrible master, and criminals want the levers.
[01:29:34.406 --> 01:29:37.647]  They're always going to get it, and there's no end to what they'll do.
[01:29:37.727 --> 01:29:41.108]  Not just for money and power, they like hurting you.
[01:29:41.368 --> 01:29:42.948]  They like squeezing you.
[01:29:43.228 --> 01:29:45.949]  They like putting cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[01:29:46.249 --> 01:29:52.650]  They love it that they poison these cops with shots and water and fluoride, and that they still serve them.
[01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:55.831]  Okay, G. Edward Griffin, you want to talk about the mindset of that?
[01:29:56.451 --> 01:30:01.192]  Well, you know, I really have trouble accepting that, although I'm not challenging you, Alex.
[01:30:01.252 --> 01:30:08.914]  I know that there are some that really get a pleasure out of pulling the wings off... Oh, no, I don't mean your average cop likes it.
[01:30:08.934 --> 01:30:10.514]  I mean the top global architects.
[01:30:10.574 --> 01:30:11.955]  Yeah, those guys at the top.
[01:30:12.075 --> 01:30:15.276]  I have no doubt that they're pretty callous to human suffering, yeah.
[01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:16.316]  I agree with that.
[01:30:17.054 --> 01:30:32.914]  But also at the middle level and the lower level, I think there must be, there have to be, I hope I'm right, there have to be thousands if not millions of people who are already involved in this new world order that somewhere along the line are going to just
[01:30:33.434 --> 01:30:34.475]  They're going to have enough.
[01:30:34.515 --> 01:30:35.775]  Like I say, we don't want any more of this.
[01:30:35.795 --> 01:30:41.738]  Hey, where do you think I get FBI training manuals and SWAT training for federal marshals?
[01:30:42.199 --> 01:30:45.400]  I mean, I've got boxes of it's all the same.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.821]  Founding Fathers are terrorists.
[01:30:47.121 --> 01:30:49.082]  Those that talk about freedom are terrorists.
[01:30:49.142 --> 01:30:53.544]  Al Qaeda is secretly white and they're everywhere and their code word is Constitution.
[01:30:53.925 --> 01:30:55.145]  I'm not joking, by the way.
[01:30:55.565 --> 01:31:02.149]  I mean, they treat these cops like they're complete idiots and I guess some of them are because they believe it, but a lot of them are good people and are now freaking out.
[01:31:02.589 --> 01:31:09.172]  Yeah, they're freaking out and then they're afraid because they're in the system and they really know what could happen to them if they turn the other way.
[01:31:09.773 --> 01:31:15.656]  My mind just suddenly went back to some years ago right during the or after the Hungarian revolt.
[01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:24.380]  If you remember, Hungary was under a terribly oppressive communist regime and almost overnight there was this unexpected revolt.
[01:31:26.322 --> 01:31:45.218]  Yes, and all of a sudden the communist regime was no longer in control and some of the military actually turned against their own military and there was complete mayhem there for a while and for a week or so afterwards the population in Hungary went rampant and they were
[01:31:46.165 --> 01:31:56.270]  They were running down some of the secret communist agents who had been running the torture prisons and they were assassinating these people.
[01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:57.431]  They were seeking revenge.
[01:31:58.229 --> 01:32:04.113]  And it was amazing, because I had talked to some Hungarians that came out of that, and they gave me a blow-by-blow description.
[01:32:04.313 --> 01:32:05.654]  Oh, well, give it to us if you have the time.
[01:32:05.694 --> 01:32:07.055]  If you have to go, go ahead.
[01:32:07.315 --> 01:32:08.475]  I can just say it very quickly.
[01:32:08.515 --> 01:32:15.039]  They said, all of a sudden, everybody who was involved in this communist apparatus was coming out and saying, oh, we hated it all along.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:16.640]  We just, we didn't support it.
[01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:18.101]  We just didn't know what to do.
[01:32:18.522 --> 01:32:20.903]  Of course, they were trying to save their hides right now.
[01:32:21.463 --> 01:32:23.625]  But, you know, it's like after the, after
[01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:31.068]  World War II, all of the people who were in the Nazi party in Germany suddenly said, oh, we hated Nazism, we didn't support it at all.
[01:32:31.708 --> 01:32:33.549]  It depends on who's winning.
[01:32:34.789 --> 01:32:39.151]  And there is a percentage of the population that will go to the winner, no matter what.
[01:32:39.191 --> 01:32:42.252]  Well, it's like rooting for whatever team you think's going to win.
[01:32:42.272 --> 01:32:45.893]  If you're going to be a sports fan, root for the team bad and good.
[01:32:45.913 --> 01:32:47.614]  You know, good years and bad.
[01:32:47.634 --> 01:32:50.695]  And I hate to use that petty analogy, but, you know, exactly.
[01:32:50.755 --> 01:32:52.536]  They root for who they think's already winning.
[01:32:52.856 --> 01:32:53.376]  Yeah, right.
[01:32:53.937 --> 01:32:56.498]  So that's what you find in a political system, too.
[01:32:56.798 --> 01:32:59.519]  And you found it in America during the Revolutionary War.
[01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:03.001]  Most of the Americans, the colonists, sat on the sidelines.
[01:33:03.461 --> 01:33:12.906]  And after the revolutionaries won the war, everybody said, well, I was always solid for the revolution, but had they lost the war, they would have said, well, I was always a supporter of the king.
[01:33:12.926 --> 01:33:13.666]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:33:13.706 --> 01:33:15.407]  Most people are sitting on the sidelines.
[01:33:15.767 --> 01:33:16.668]  Why isn't anybody waking up?
[01:33:17.768 --> 01:33:18.669]  Well, they are waking up.
[01:33:18.749 --> 01:33:20.910]  I mean, I've never seen an awakening this big.
[01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:23.972]  But the enemy media is not going to tell you that we're waking up.
[01:33:24.012 --> 01:33:25.253]  G. Eber Griffin comments on that.
[01:33:25.493 --> 01:33:28.635]  Yeah, that's because they don't want that mass exodus.
[01:33:29.275 --> 01:33:32.377]  People want to be on the side of the movement.
[01:33:32.757 --> 01:33:39.121]  So if the media let the people think that there was a movement toward waking up, then there would be more people waking up.
[01:33:39.381 --> 01:33:40.382]  Abraham, thanks for the call.
[01:33:40.642 --> 01:33:44.285]  Jebra Griffin, I've got four more calls, but if you've got to go, I don't... I do.
[01:33:45.025 --> 01:33:47.487]  So you've got another show or some work you've got to do coming up?
[01:33:47.507 --> 01:33:48.068]  I sure do.
[01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:50.309]  Okay, do you have one more minute?
[01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:51.771]  I certainly do.
[01:33:51.931 --> 01:33:55.353]  Okay, in closing, I don't want you to think you can't challenge me.
[01:33:56.174 --> 01:34:02.679]  I said something earlier about pure evil in government, and you were saying, I don't know if I can believe that they're all that evil.
[01:34:02.739 --> 01:34:03.680]  I wasn't saying that.
[01:34:04.921 --> 01:34:07.663]  Were you specifically wanting to disagree with me on anything I was saying?
[01:34:08.303 --> 01:34:18.550]  No, I was just feeling uncomfortable, Alex, with the idea that all of the people involved in this movement are evil people and that they enjoy inflicting pain.
[01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:20.731]  And I don't think that's what you were saying either.
[01:34:21.131 --> 01:34:23.293]  I just wanted to clarify that that wasn't my view.
[01:34:23.313 --> 01:34:25.935]  No, no, I agree with you that most of them are ignorant.
[01:34:25.955 --> 01:34:29.257]  In fact, a lot of them are doing evil things and think it's for the greater good.
[01:34:29.337 --> 01:34:30.017]  Yes, yes.
[01:34:30.317 --> 01:34:32.999]  Okay, well, Freedom Force International, give them that website.
[01:34:33.219 --> 01:34:35.120]  Yes, it's freedomforceinternational.org.
[01:34:36.528 --> 01:34:48.119]  Be prepared to spend some time, and if you really want to do something about changing the events we're talking about, if you want to make a difference in the world, and not just complain about it, this is the place for you.
[01:34:48.299 --> 01:34:49.841]  Well, I want to have you back up again.
[01:34:49.861 --> 01:34:58.008]  I mean, I have you up about once a year over the last 12 years, 13 years, but time is short as you know, so I appreciate you spending so much time with us, and take care, my friend.
[01:34:58.049 --> 01:35:01.592]  Well, thank you so much, Alex, and God bless you, and talk to you next time.
[01:35:01.812 --> 01:35:02.153]  Take care.
[01:35:20.454 --> 01:35:27.199]  Who was there while they were telling him the Constitution, that's terrorism, you can't talk about it.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.161]  This is big news, folks.
[01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:31.863]  Bill in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:35:31.883 --> 01:35:34.264]  Hey, how you doing, brother?
[01:35:34.284 --> 01:35:35.385]  It's good talking to you.
[01:35:35.485 --> 01:35:36.326]  Good to talk to you, Bill.
[01:35:36.726 --> 01:35:49.055]  Hey, just for all the non-believers out there, I am a victim of 30 years of three microchips embedded into the back of my neck.
[01:35:50.642 --> 01:36:08.048]  And at the time when my father came back from Vietnam, he was working for, get this, I found out through the Social Security Administration and two hospital administrators, that he was working for the DOD, the Navy, and the Army at the same time.
[01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:38.378]  And when I had to go in for my surgery, this was after, this was March 21st of last year, I ended up putting a crowbar accidentally through my, I was trying to put a lift kit on my jeep truck anyway, ended up flying back about 20 feet, landed on the back of my head, shoved this crowbar three and a half inches into my brain, into my temporal and frontal lobe, and so I had to have some serious surgery done, and one of the neurosurgeons,
[01:36:39.224 --> 01:36:58.351]  Had come into the room, this is after my second injection, and they said that, they told my wife and her family and my mom, and my mom said it was all my dad, and she walked out, didn't even stay for the surgery or anything, and they said, look, he's got a 10% chance to live on this.
[01:36:58.932 --> 01:37:04.734]  If we strap him down to the operating table, and that Rambo chip in his right shoulder goes off, he's dead.
[01:37:06.068 --> 01:37:09.390]  And she walked out and just irate and tried to totally...
[01:37:35.828 --> 01:37:36.429]  Yeah, sure, go ahead.
[01:37:50.399 --> 01:37:53.980]  I think what we're missing... Oh, and Brother Alex, please, slow down.
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.840]  I don't want you to get a heart attack.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:57.441]  Well, I did just slow down.
[01:37:57.461 --> 01:38:01.602]  I just went to the beach for a few days with the family, and then I'm completely crazed when I come back.
[01:38:01.742 --> 01:38:10.584]  In fact, I think the thing is, get a lot of other people to fill in for you so that they know that if you go down, there's a lot of other people just waiting to step into the breach.
[01:38:10.944 --> 01:38:12.104]  That's your only way to be safe.
[01:38:12.856 --> 01:38:13.336]  Let them know.
[01:38:13.356 --> 01:38:16.177]  See, you've got to realize it's them against us.
[01:38:16.717 --> 01:38:21.618]  And let them know that if they do you in, then somebody's going to step right in there and do the same thing.
[01:38:21.838 --> 01:38:23.279]  Oh, I don't, yeah.
[01:38:23.319 --> 01:38:29.641]  You know, I talk a lot about that because people constantly marvel and discuss it, and I have to be killed by the government to prove I'm a good person.
[01:38:31.041 --> 01:38:32.181]  It isn't about that.
[01:38:33.662 --> 01:38:35.202]  And it's about the issues.
[01:38:35.262 --> 01:38:38.123]  Well, I know, but you just brought me up being killed, so I'm commenting.
[01:38:38.143 --> 01:38:38.543]  Go ahead.
[01:38:39.645 --> 01:38:45.214]  Anyway, what's really a problem with us is we're not using parody and sarcasm the way we should.
[01:38:45.274 --> 01:38:46.697]  Now, I think we should say that...
[01:38:47.282 --> 01:38:51.405]  We should petition the people to make the courts a Constitution-free zone.
[01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:53.366]  I think that's what we're playing the game with.
[01:38:53.406 --> 01:38:59.831]  Well, the feds have already been saying that the Constitution is not admissible in any federal court, and there's a ban on the Second Amendment.
[01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:02.953]  You and I know this, and I'm a few selected few know it.
[01:39:03.013 --> 01:39:04.214]  It doesn't get down to the bottom.
[01:39:04.634 --> 01:39:10.158]  YouTube, with people saying, oh yeah, I think the courts should be a Constitution-free zone, should go up on the YouTube.
[01:39:10.178 --> 01:39:10.378]  See?
[01:39:11.399 --> 01:39:11.839]  No, no, no.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:16.443]  You should go before your city council and propose a ban on any liberty or freedom.
[01:39:17.239 --> 01:39:18.280]  Or no, let's go too far.
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:18.620]  No, no.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.322]  Or say, for the carbon tax, we should all kill ourselves.
[01:39:21.382 --> 01:39:21.502]  No, no.
[01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:23.483]  The courts are a very important issue.
[01:39:23.743 --> 01:39:26.785]  The courts are the places where the Constitution is being scrapped.
[01:39:27.702 --> 01:39:29.463]  So that we should let them go ahead with it.
[01:39:29.483 --> 01:39:33.586]  Say, okay, we'll make it right that the courts can be a constitution-free zone.
[01:39:33.966 --> 01:39:42.792]  Play what they're doing up to the limit and go overboard and use hyperbola as a tool against them because they don't want people to realize that the courts are a constitution-free zone.
[01:39:43.292 --> 01:39:50.877]  Well, no, I agree with you, but I mean, it's so over the top that it's... Well, we can go over the top and make them look like idiots because that's what they're doing.
[01:39:51.517 --> 01:39:58.559]  Well, I mean, this is the New York Sun headline, gag on 2nd Amendment and cities aimed to, uh, in gun suit.
[01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:06.001]  So, I mean, it's just, now tasers telling doctors will sue you if you say taser caused somebody to die?
[01:40:06.202 --> 01:40:07.282]  That is incredible.
[01:40:07.842 --> 01:40:10.244]  No, I mean, we have entered total lala land.
[01:40:10.284 --> 01:40:11.244]  You're a great caller, thanks.
[01:40:11.304 --> 01:40:12.345]  I'm going to get to everybody else here.
[01:40:13.586 --> 01:40:16.148]  Speaking of the devil, I am not going to work as hard.
[01:40:16.168 --> 01:40:17.889]  I've got to go home for a few hours before I come back tonight.
[01:40:18.309 --> 01:40:25.915]  Finish up the film that you're going to be seeing coming up next Saturday and Sunday at the Elmo Draft House in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:25.935 --> 01:40:27.296]  Details at Infowars.com.
[01:40:27.616 --> 01:40:28.777]  Joe in California, go ahead.
[01:40:29.628 --> 01:40:30.449]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:40:30.469 --> 01:40:30.569]  Good.
[01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:31.670]  I haven't spoken to you in a while.
[01:40:31.690 --> 01:40:37.193]  I really wanted to share this with Mr. Griffin, because he's awesome, and he's the one that led me to find this.
[01:40:37.494 --> 01:40:47.921]  I've got an incredible quote with regards to what's going on with the North American Union by, actually, of all people, Carroll Quigley, on page 133 of Tragedy and Hope, and he says the following.
[01:40:48.401 --> 01:40:54.606]  The road secret society was, quote, constantly harping on the lessons to be learned from the failure of the American Revolution
[01:40:54.926 --> 01:40:55.368]  We're good to go.
[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:09.926]  Then confederate the whole of it with the United Kingdom into a single organization, hoping to bring the United States into this organization to whatever degree possible.
[01:41:10.206 --> 01:41:15.470]  Yeah, here he is saying the failure of the British Empire was not keeping the Americanos under their control.
[01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:24.837]  And he goes on to say, making Washington the capital of the whole organization, or allow parts of the empire to become states of the American Union.
[01:41:25.831 --> 01:41:26.592]  Emphasis added.
[01:41:26.732 --> 01:41:27.693]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:41:28.053 --> 01:41:36.200]  Yeah, and they're setting it up, and as the toll roads go in, and they call it Trans-Texas Corridor, they say on the news these toll roads do not exist.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:41.404]  As they go in, and as it says Trans-Texas Corridor, the news announces that that doesn't exist.
[01:41:42.465 --> 01:41:43.166]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[01:41:43.186 --> 01:41:45.027]  We are dealing in total mind control.
[01:41:45.087 --> 01:41:47.710]  Just absolute la-la land.
[01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:50.232]  The Constitution's arrestable if you mention it.
[01:41:50.992 --> 01:41:52.193]  Black uniforms are good.
[01:41:54.555 --> 01:42:03.685]  He quickly got this from the documents dated 1884 to 1915 from the Secret Roads Chica Society.
[01:42:04.066 --> 01:42:06.629]  I mean, this has been in the making for ages.
[01:42:08.406 --> 01:42:08.806]  Absolutely.
[01:42:08.866 --> 01:42:09.167]  I know.
[01:42:09.447 --> 01:42:09.847]  You know what?
[01:42:10.267 --> 01:42:11.828]  I have read Tragedy and Hope.
[01:42:11.848 --> 01:42:14.270]  Believe it or not, I have read the entire 900 pages.
[01:42:15.211 --> 01:42:16.632]  But that was years ago.
[01:42:16.812 --> 01:42:21.735]  And I had a copy around here and gave it to a local journalist who ran off with my only copy.
[01:42:21.755 --> 01:42:22.596]  We've got to buy another.
[01:42:23.156 --> 01:42:26.878]  But why don't you do a scan of that and then, you know, like write an article.
[01:42:26.919 --> 01:42:33.143]  Just point out Cecil Rhodes admitted they had planned for North American Union as part of British Empire in 1910 or whatever.
[01:42:33.423 --> 01:42:34.784]  And then send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:38.346 --> 01:42:38.646]  Got it.
[01:42:38.906 --> 01:42:39.486]  Hey, good job.
[01:42:39.666 --> 01:42:40.266]  Good to hear from you.
[01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:41.347]  You bet.
[01:42:41.407 --> 01:42:43.507]  Last caller, Nicholas in Denver.
[01:42:44.507 --> 01:42:44.927]  Hi, Alex.
[01:42:45.207 --> 01:42:45.728]  Hello, sir.
[01:42:45.968 --> 01:42:46.668]  Everything you're doing.
[01:42:46.908 --> 01:42:47.808]  No, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:50.368]  Here, go ahead.
[01:42:50.388 --> 01:42:51.029]  We all are now.
[01:42:51.069 --> 01:42:52.349]  We're all terrorists because we love freedom.
[01:42:52.749 --> 01:42:53.109]  Go ahead.
[01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:54.029]  Sorry.
[01:42:54.229 --> 01:43:00.370]  What I have to say is, I understand, you know, people are running for, you know, like, small offices around the country now.
[01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:01.631]  People are waking up, whatnot.
[01:43:02.491 --> 01:43:07.552]  But do we have enough time left to
[01:43:09.525 --> 01:43:12.287]  Take over control of the system again.
[01:43:12.347 --> 01:43:13.487]  Do we have that much time?
[01:43:13.508 --> 01:43:22.873]  Is there anything other than, like, a Gandhi-style march on Washington that would actually reverse what is going on?
[01:43:22.933 --> 01:43:29.918]  Because the system, obviously, is hijacked, you know, and how do you reverse that in time?
[01:43:29.938 --> 01:43:33.520]  I mean, when another attack happens, it's over, don't you think?
[01:43:35.565 --> 01:43:41.970]  It's not over because if we would have let them grandstand after they staged 9-11, the next attack it would have been over.
[01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:48.395]  But now we've taken their favorite tool of attacking us and posing as our saviors and we've smashed it in front of them.
[01:43:49.176 --> 01:43:52.358]  And so now, no, they're scared.
[01:43:53.439 --> 01:44:00.283]  I mean, I had a top levelist on last week, and he knew who I was, and was well aware, and was trying to come on and counter us, and he wasn't happy at the end of it.
[01:44:00.783 --> 01:44:08.588]  I mean, his stupid little tricks, he was shocked that, you know, even though he knew who we were, he thought he would just mesmerize us, and the guy's really nothing.
[01:44:08.988 --> 01:44:09.648]  We're going to defeat him.
[01:44:09.688 --> 01:44:10.749]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:44:12.625 --> 01:44:14.446]  I mean, I've got all this other news here.
[01:44:15.887 --> 01:44:18.889]  A guy in Canada, the patient was dying.
[01:44:18.949 --> 01:44:20.070]  His lungs are going out.
[01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:20.210]  He's 82.
[01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:22.792]  He has horrible emphysema.
[01:44:22.812 --> 01:44:25.914]  The hospital admits that he gets delusional and collapses.
[01:44:26.554 --> 01:44:29.837]  And so he was mumbling under his breath saying, I'm going to get you.
[01:44:30.317 --> 01:44:37.502]  And rather than medical workers coming in and holding him down and strapping him down and getting him oxygen, he went, oh my gosh, the man's delirious.
[01:44:38.382 --> 01:44:41.585]  All the time, people that have diabetes who are stumbling around, you know,
[01:44:43.117 --> 01:44:45.519]  From blood sugar problems, delirious, they taser them.
[01:44:45.859 --> 01:44:47.821]  Or autistic kids, they're tasering them.
[01:44:47.841 --> 01:44:48.661]  I mean, just Google it.
[01:44:48.722 --> 01:44:57.769]  It's just, oh, this 82-year-old man, strapped down in his bed, is threatening people, deliriously, dying, admitted he was dying.
[01:44:58.429 --> 01:44:59.350]  And it doesn't matter.
[01:44:59.390 --> 01:45:00.931]  We'll just deal with him.
[01:45:00.951 --> 01:45:03.073]  You know, this person's very wicked.
[01:45:03.834 --> 01:45:04.754]  So there's that article.
[01:45:05.535 --> 01:45:08.816]  Connecticut man says cops broke into his home and ripped out his catheter.
[01:45:08.856 --> 01:45:09.637]  They admit they did.
[01:45:09.677 --> 01:45:11.857]  They're like, watch this, and just ripped it out.
[01:45:11.877 --> 01:45:13.598]  I mean, just total steroid goons.
[01:45:14.558 --> 01:45:15.359]  That's AP.
[01:45:15.919 --> 01:45:18.580]  Ex-cop officers routinely lie to obtain search warrants.
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:19.780]  They call it liefying.
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.541]  Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[01:45:21.761 --> 01:45:23.802]  This is the type of news I don't get to on the show.
[01:45:23.822 --> 01:45:24.442]  People say, you're just
[01:45:24.462 --> 01:45:25.423]  Trying to bash cops.
[01:45:25.783 --> 01:45:29.566]  Folks, I could go for 10 hours with the stuff that comes out every day.
[01:45:30.006 --> 01:45:33.529]  I don't even cover this on air most of the time because I've got other things to cover.
[01:45:33.889 --> 01:45:38.712]  I'm very sad about this man arrested for turning without signal outside Austin.
[01:45:39.986 --> 01:45:40.746]  Alright, I'm out of time.
[01:45:40.806 --> 01:45:42.747]  That's it, ladies and gentlemen, for this transmission.
[01:45:44.728 --> 01:45:48.910]  I'm going to be showing my new film, Truth Rising, that's Cinema Veritas.
[01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:50.271]  Cinema Verite.
[01:45:50.311 --> 01:45:52.351]  There is no voiceover, no nothing.
[01:45:52.652 --> 01:45:53.592]  It's very well done.
[01:45:53.612 --> 01:45:55.373]  Alamo Draft House, downtown, The Ritz.
[01:45:55.773 --> 01:45:56.733]  Saturday, 3.30.
[01:45:57.094 --> 01:45:57.914]  Sunday, 6.30.
[01:45:58.374 --> 01:45:58.994]  And then that's it.
[01:45:59.375 --> 01:46:00.475]  I'm not showing it anymore.
[01:46:00.515 --> 01:46:00.935]  That's it.
[01:46:00.975 --> 01:46:03.716]  It's going to be on DVD and PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:46:03.776 --> 01:46:04.637]  It'll be out in a few months.
[01:46:05.217 --> 01:46:08.719]  I'm just having this to really gauge what people think of it, maybe tweak it a bit.
[01:46:08.759 --> 01:46:10.340]  So this is really a special event.
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:11.621]  Hope to see you there.
[01:46:11.961 --> 01:46:13.682]  Details at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:14.202 --> 01:46:16.904]  And I want to thank the fine crew for the wonderful job they've done.
[01:46:16.924 --> 01:46:20.686]  I have now done 4 hours and 50 minutes, 30 seconds.
[01:46:21.286 --> 01:46:22.687]  And I am now going to sign off.
[01:46:24.509 --> 01:46:30.095]  We will meet the show, I might as well go four minutes until the rebroadcast perfectly meshes with the show.
[01:46:30.516 --> 01:46:36.202]  We'll now be into the second segment with the young Pasker who was told he'd be arrested by Homeland Security.
[01:46:36.222 --> 01:46:38.545]  Have you ever talked about the Constitution to anybody again?
[01:46:38.565 --> 01:46:40.607]  And that story's up on Prison Planet.
[01:46:41.952 --> 01:46:59.389]  And I really want to ask everybody out there, if we're not able to stop this 26,000 preachers out telling their flocks to turn their guns in and go to FEMA camps, if we're not able to expose that we have the FBI training manuals where they're saying people that talk about freedom are terrorists, if they're able to get away
[01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:06.131]  With all of this, they are going to basically just have it accepted.
[01:47:06.191 --> 01:47:09.172]  Like, yes, you're not allowed to say we're supposed to have freedom.
[01:47:09.192 --> 01:47:10.092]  That's terrorism.
[01:47:11.813 --> 01:47:13.453]  We must take your freedom to protect your freedom.
[01:47:14.734 --> 01:47:16.754]  We have to stand up and say, this is insane.
[01:47:17.214 --> 01:47:23.336]  You have these secret police creeping around everywhere, engaging in these types of behaviors.
[01:47:23.396 --> 01:47:25.236]  We have to do this now.
[01:47:26.016 --> 01:47:26.777]  Not next week.
[01:47:26.897 --> 01:47:27.697]  Not next year.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:32.682]  And I also just want to ask the listeners out there to continue to support us.
[01:47:32.842 --> 01:47:42.286]  I want to get a bigger office so I can hire more people, get better cameras, better computers, do different work, and I'm so busy fighting the New World Order half the time that I don't even remember to plug things.
[01:47:42.766 --> 01:47:54.832]  If you've got a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, you can watch this overdrive hour, sometimes overdrive two hours, like today, at PrisonPlanet.tv if you are a member of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:47:58.684 --> 01:47:59.925]  And it's 15 cents a day.
[01:47:59.945 --> 01:48:02.247]  I don't care if you share your passcode with a few people either.
[01:48:02.747 --> 01:48:05.629]  By the way, did we turn that up where more IP addresses can contact it?
[01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:07.391]  Because you see, we didn't have the servers.
[01:48:08.451 --> 01:48:10.733]  And now we have two great CDN systems.
[01:48:11.414 --> 01:48:13.055]  And just go look at the new quality of the videos.
[01:48:13.095 --> 01:48:13.915]  Go look at the downloads.
[01:48:13.935 --> 01:48:16.297]  Go look at the, you know, I mean, we take this because it's streamed.
[01:48:16.337 --> 01:48:17.938]  It's in lower quality, not like the films.
[01:48:18.259 --> 01:48:21.041]  But then it's posted in pretty good quality within an hour of the show ending.
[01:48:21.781 --> 01:48:24.203]  I mean, just great stuff at presentplanet.tv.
[01:48:24.563 --> 01:48:25.824]  Built for activism.
[01:48:25.904 --> 01:48:27.225]  Built for getting the word out.
[01:48:28.226 --> 01:48:33.168]  A factory, an armory, an arsenal of resistance against the New World Order.
[01:48:33.228 --> 01:48:34.649]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:48:34.689 --> 01:48:39.851]  If you had a membership and you let it lapse a few years ago, it's been up for more than four years, go get one now.
[01:48:39.971 --> 01:48:40.812]  See what we've added.
[01:48:41.312 --> 01:48:42.332]  All 18 of my films.
[01:48:42.392 --> 01:48:45.394]  My book, Paul Watson's book, that's out of print, only on eBook.
[01:48:46.314 --> 01:48:50.175]  All my weekly TV reports, the Sunday show that's videotaped, in-studio special interviews.
[01:48:50.695 --> 01:48:51.696]  You get all of that.
[01:48:51.836 --> 01:48:53.896]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:48:53.916 --> 01:48:58.637]  And then we have the document cam and we do exclusive video clips here on the show.
[01:48:59.758 --> 01:49:03.899]  And just so much more for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:49:04.179 --> 01:49:05.279]  And it's a Catch-22.
[01:49:05.359 --> 01:49:11.101]  I could talk for 10 hours without ever plugging a sponsor or a product or anything, but we wouldn't exist here.
[01:49:11.997 --> 01:49:14.138]  And we know the economy's going to hell in a handbasket.
[01:49:14.159 --> 01:49:25.926]  We're trying to capitalize now so we can weather storms like the ants, not the grasshoppers, trying to store some Federal Reserve notes, convert them into something so we have funding capital to operate.
[01:49:25.946 --> 01:49:26.967]  Because this is not a business.
[01:49:27.007 --> 01:49:29.969]  If things get bad, I will continue and spend my savings.
[01:49:31.029 --> 01:49:32.110]  to fight the new world order.
[01:49:32.991 --> 01:49:38.594]  The mission of InfoWars.com, the mission of this radio show is not to make money for money's sake.
[01:49:39.074 --> 01:49:42.396]  It is to build the operation, add infrastructure.
[01:49:42.516 --> 01:49:43.437]  It is to innovate.
[01:49:43.477 --> 01:49:44.378]  It is to resist.
[01:49:44.798 --> 01:49:46.059]  It is to fight corruption.
[01:49:46.099 --> 01:49:58.446]  It is to move on and elevate people to the next level of understanding and bring on the guests and people who actually have proven themselves to be patriots to magnify them and build them up.
[01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:01.248]  This is what we do.
[01:50:01.368 --> 01:50:03.350]  This is what we are all about.
[01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:04.310]  I'm out of time.
[01:50:04.571 --> 01:50:06.912]  We will now go into retransmission with key info.
[01:50:06.932 --> 01:50:09.134]  And I mean key info at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:09.194 --> 01:50:16.299]  Please spread the word right now about this story on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:50:16.339 --> 01:50:16.880]  Headline,
[01:50:18.228 --> 01:50:22.912]  Feds accuse students of terror and espionage for talking about Constitution.
[01:50:22.932 --> 01:50:24.693]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:50:25.133 --> 01:50:27.235]  Only in the land of the coward, home of the slaves.
[01:50:27.495 --> 01:50:29.377]  Let's make it land of the free, home of the brave again.
[01:50:29.677 --> 01:50:30.637]  Let's get this country back.
[01:50:30.657 --> 01:50:33.299]  Alright, that's Alex Jones with five hours of radio.
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:34.701]  See you back tomorrow.
[01:50:35.501 --> 01:50:36.582]  See, I do this because I love it.
[01:50:37.002 --> 01:50:39.164]  Not like the other talk show hosts who just want to be big daddies.
[01:50:39.684 --> 01:50:40.485]  This is the real deal.
[01:50:40.505 --> 01:50:41.426]  God bless you all.
[01:50:57.418 --> 01:50:58.141]  Any overhead.
