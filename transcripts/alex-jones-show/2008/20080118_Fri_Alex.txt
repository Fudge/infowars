[00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:11.172]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:12.654]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:14.335]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:18.738]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:23.242]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:43.488]  We have a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:45.351]  He hasn't been on with us in over a month.
[00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:48.395]  Dr. Jerome Corsi will be joining us in the third hour.
[00:00:49.887 --> 00:01:00.436]  Discuss how the mainstream media continues to claim that there's no such thing as a NAU, Napa Superhighway, Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:05.460]  Doesn't matter, they're building it, announcing it, the federal documents show they've signed on to the agreements.
[00:01:06.503 --> 00:01:23.097]  Business owners from Texas to California are being sent, we even have just a few employees, letters by their workforce commissions, their departments of labor, from the feds, through the states, telling them you've got to sign on to the North American ID system, replacing the U.S.
[00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:24.698]  employer system.
[00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.323]  It's all happening, but we can continue to see this massive denial, so that's coming up.
[00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:33.102]  In the third hour.
[00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:37.066]  We get him on about once a year or so when he has a new book out.
[00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:41.370]  We're going to be talking to Patrick J. Buchanan today.
[00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.412]  Day of Reckoning.
[00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:48.276]  How Hubris, Ideology and Greed are Tearing America Apart.
[00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:52.700]  We're also going to get his take on the Ron Paul revolution.
[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.004]  So, more big guests coming up on the broadcast for you today.
[00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:06.324]  Speaking of the North American Union, Wall Street Journal today, Senate approval of Peru pact aids Bush's free trade agenda.
[00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:17.752]  When you hear free trade, that means the American Union expanding out of the North American Union, as Vicente Fox has said it is meant to do, as the Council on Foreign Relations has said it was meant to do.
[00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:22.655]  You know, last week in Florida, even the mainstream news reported
[00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.850]  St.
[00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.772]  Petersburg newspaper and others that Romney people were allowed to vote as many times as they wanted.
[00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:29.912]  No one else was allowed to.
[00:02:30.412 --> 00:02:31.413]  Five-year-olds voted.
[00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:32.813]  Some people voted on video.
[00:02:32.893 --> 00:02:33.553]  They didn't care.
[00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:37.334]  Fifteen times apiece, one person did, for Romney.
[00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:46.818]  And so Ron Paul was winning two to one, but then the Romney people showed up on buses with unlimited tickets and were able to do that.
[00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:51.219]  Then he, Ron Paul won in Virginia because they had a fair poll.
[00:02:52.196 --> 00:03:09.523]  Well, now in San Francisco, the GOP has cancelled the straw poll, because as scores of Ron Paul supporters showed up, and there really wasn't many other people showing up, the GOP sponsors just cancelled it.
[00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.923]  I mean, look at all this corruption.
[00:03:12.023 --> 00:03:18.146]  Oh, no, the government and different parties, they would never steal elections.
[00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:21.418]  Never cheat!
[00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:23.099]  They would never!
[00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:41.768]  Let's just trust these black boxes with no record of how you voted, with the different engineers from the major companies going public and saying they were hired to engage in fraud, and the thousands of cases where they've been caught engaged in fraud, and their own internal memos, and their own directors publicly saying, I'm here to deliver the votes to this person or that person.
[00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:45.110]  I mean, it's just wall to wall.
[00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:57.782]  Corruption and fake FEMA newscasts, and fake INS slash ICE Homeland Security press conferences, and fake news purchases in the tens of billions.
[00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.406]  I mean, just a rain of propaganda spew.
[00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:05.990]  But it's easily discernible from the real and accurate news that's out there.
[00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.454]  Even a lot of mainstream news is accurate if you know how to check the basis, the background,
[00:04:11.357 --> 00:04:11.717]  We're good.
[00:04:33.984 --> 00:04:35.765]  But it's really a knowledge you gain, too.
[00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:39.386]  And even when you're an expert in this, you occasionally get hoodwinked.
[00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:42.607]  But it's good to just know this stuff is going on.
[00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:44.748]  I've got a bunch of other news.
[00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.369]  Is the ex-Canadian Prime Minister the next 9-11 truther?
[00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:57.612]  We'll talk about that as well and more on the former Italian President coming out and saying 9-11 is a big fat inside job.
[00:04:57.912 --> 00:04:58.572]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:09.589]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.210]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:05.156]  A new world order.
[00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:08.617]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:11.418 --> 00:06:18.847]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.568 --> 00:06:26.937]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:34.898]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[00:06:39.241 --> 00:06:41.743]  Bill Barrett is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:42.944]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:42.964 --> 00:06:43.724]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.744 --> 00:06:44.805]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.025 --> 00:06:45.786]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:47.027]  That's what they're after.

[00:06:55.492 --> 00:06:58.494]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.674 --> 00:06:59.695]  You have been warned.
[00:07:00.716 --> 00:07:04.779]  It seems like every time you pull up to the pump, gas prices have gone up again.
[00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.262]  Not only is it frustrating, it's costing you more money than ever before.
[00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:12.065]  Well, the solution is here, and it's called System 48 Plus.
[00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:18.450]  System 48 Plus increases horsepower, improves engine performance, and restores compression with one easy application.
[00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.914]  System 48 Plus even cleans the engine walls, saving you from costly repairs.
[00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:26.917]  It works with regular or synthetic motor oil, and can even be used in diesel engines.
[00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:27.778]  We're good to go.
[00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:08.904]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.524 --> 00:08:12.505]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:42.505]  Yesterday, thanks to a listener tip, we picked up on one of the major Italian newspapers, well actually several of them, that the former president had gone public and said that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:08:43.445 --> 00:08:52.348]  And then I had my wife look at it, whose dad worked for the Agriculture Department, so she lived in France, she lived in Spain, she also lived in Italy, so she speaks good Italian.
[00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:53.188]  Sad issue.
[00:08:53.228 --> 00:08:53.728]  The point is,
[00:08:54.919 --> 00:09:00.082]  Uh, that, um, she went and read it and said, yeah, he indeed says that.
[00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:05.745]  And, uh, then, um, they posted it on a bunch of message boards, a bunch of news sites picked it up.
[00:09:06.426 --> 00:09:08.167]  Um, a lot of the people are saying this is fake.
[00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:09.027]  It isn't real.
[00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:14.210]  Babelfish is wrong because they were using Babelfish to decipher it.
[00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.833]  And it did indeed in Babelfish say that he was saying that it was an inside job.
[00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:26.673]  And now a bunch of other big sites have had people translate it into the exact same translation we got.
[00:09:27.054 --> 00:09:29.496]  He did say it, and that's just the way it is.
[00:09:31.017 --> 00:09:36.461]  People are in continual denial about any serious news.
[00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:44.507]  I remember when we first got the PBS video of Larry Silverstein saying that
[00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:47.410]  They gave the order to pull it and watch the building come down.
[00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:54.772]  The next clip in the film is them destroying the other buildings months later and going, getting ready to pull building six, and then they blow it up.
[00:09:55.973 --> 00:09:57.893]  And pull is a demolition term.
[00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:06.476]  There have been news articles done where engineers have called, you know, 30, 40 companies and emailed them and gotten them to respond.
[00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:07.437]  What does pull it mean?
[00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:09.077]  And that means controlled demolition.
[00:10:09.097 --> 00:10:11.338]  I mean, folks are going to deny this.
[00:10:12.659 --> 00:10:13.719]  Folks are going to deny this.
[00:10:14.549 --> 00:10:18.051]  The White House is now saying they never said Iraq had WMDs.
[00:10:18.611 --> 00:10:30.496]  Doesn't matter how many video clips, how many audio clips, how many presidential addresses, how many states of the unions, how many press conferences by then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, they're just saying they never said it!
[00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:34.878]  Remember, Karl Rove said that we control reality, i.e.
[00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:35.518]  the White House.
[00:10:35.598 --> 00:10:37.139]  We control the future.
[00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:39.180]  We are the history's actors.
[00:10:42.614 --> 00:10:46.015]  And everyone else is just spectators.
[00:10:46.075 --> 00:10:48.856]  Well, we don't have to be spectators anymore.
[00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:50.297]  We don't have to go along with this.
[00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:58.140]  When they say the amnesty bill isn't an amnesty bill, but it's secret, just trust us, and then we get a copy of the bill, and it's the biggest amnesty in U.S.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.741]  history, they've now been discredited again.
[00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:11.725]  When they come out and say there's no longer mercury in vaccines, and then Bush vetoes a bill trying to legally block mercury in vaccines, they're discredited again.
[00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:24.919]  When they say there's no NAFTA superhighway structure being built, when it's on the Federal Transportation Department's own websites and announcements for five years running, the Trans-Texas Corridor for at least five, six years has been announced in Texas, thousands of places.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:33.506]  I mean, do you believe CNN gets up there and just says, it doesn't exist, Ron Paul's delusional and just makes things up and is insane?
[00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:44.408]  So I really welcome the wholesale denial by the establishment, because it isn't working anymore.
[00:11:44.508 --> 00:11:47.270]  People are finding out that you're a pack of liars.
[00:11:47.970 --> 00:12:01.359]  But again, ex-Italian president, intel agencies know 9-11, an inside job, man who blew the whistle on Gladio tells Italy's largest newspaper attacks were run by CIA Mossad.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.203]  You can see our translation there on the site, and you can then go to
[00:12:07.639 --> 00:12:08.881]  We're good to go.
[00:12:28.334 --> 00:12:32.957]  He fingered Israel even stronger, ladies and gentlemen, than we had first said.
[00:12:33.017 --> 00:12:38.580]  We just translated it to say that all the intelligence agencies know that U.S.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.043]  intelligence and the Mossad carried out the attacks to launch wars in the Middle East.
[00:12:44.883 --> 00:12:52.967]  He actually goes on to say the U.S., the Mossad, for the Zionists.
[00:12:53.207 --> 00:12:57.670]  So it's very volatile, very incendiary.
[00:12:58.405 --> 00:13:09.130]  We're just reporting on what this highly respected seven-year, that's a long time for an Italian politics, former president and also former intelligence chief is saying.
[00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.372]  So there was a double statement on Israel, not a single.
[00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:15.333]  So it was worse than what we said.
[00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:19.756]  Excuse me, we always at first don't get it as bad as it actually is.
[00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:23.037]  Excuse us for trying to decipher it and do that for everybody.
[00:13:26.252 --> 00:13:30.735]  Here is the translation, word for word, from Italian into English, okay?
[00:13:32.136 --> 00:13:32.756]  By my wife.
[00:13:32.976 --> 00:13:41.041]  And then when others did it, it was exactly when other Italian websites responded, and when it was translated, word for word, exactly as we said.
[00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:41.941]  Okay?
[00:13:42.261 --> 00:13:48.125]  Bin Laden supposedly confessed to the Al-Qaeda September attack.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.223]  To the two towers in New York, claiming to be the author of the attack of 9-11.
[00:13:53.543 --> 00:14:17.920]  While all the intelligence services of America and Europe know well that the disastrous attack had been planned and realized from the CIA, American, and the Mossad, with the aid of the Zionist world, in order to put under accusation the Arabic countries, and in order to induce the Western powers to take part in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:14:19.412 --> 00:14:23.633]  Now, that is the exact translation out of Italian.
[00:14:26.253 --> 00:14:30.194]  But the government is not even officially denying this.
[00:14:30.214 --> 00:14:37.735]  They're having their moles and disinfo people still run around from Digg to you name it, saying he didn't say that.
[00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:42.396]  Now, he's gone public before about the U.S.
[00:14:42.436 --> 00:14:48.017]  government in conjunction with the Italian government staging terror attacks in Operation Gladiobe.
[00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:55.505]  Across Europe and Italy in the 1960s, 70s, and culminating in the Bologna bombing in 1980.
[00:14:56.345 --> 00:15:07.531]  And an official Italian parliamentary inquiry in 2000 officially found that intelligence agencies of the West staged the terror attacks.
[00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:10.212]  Just as he said in 1992.
[00:15:10.812 --> 00:15:16.735]  Okay, he's the guy that broke that.
[00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:18.696]  He'd been the intelligence chief before that,
[00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:19.812]  I think so.
[00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:20.112]  I think so.
[00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:41.252]  People say, well, why would he do that?
[00:15:42.373 --> 00:15:50.075]  Some people have a soul, ladies and gentlemen, and it was just too much to watch all those dead children and women at Bologna.
[00:15:50.095 --> 00:15:53.235]  There was 144 killed at that event.
[00:15:53.255 --> 00:15:58.637]  It's all covered in TerrorStorm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:16:00.737 --> 00:16:04.038]  Before we go to break, I want to play this three-minute clip from
[00:16:05.948 --> 00:16:15.904]  The news, young Pakistanis, Bin Laden is a CIA creation, Good Morning America gets more than it bargained for in a feature on young people in Pakistan.
[00:16:15.944 --> 00:16:19.089]  And then the person that edited this video together, you'll hear the audio.
[00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:29.122]  Put it together with documents and statements and Bush making comments that just back up what we already knew, that it literally is just a completely staged event.
[00:16:29.362 --> 00:16:31.743]  He's a real person, a real asset of the government.
[00:16:31.763 --> 00:16:37.144]  Tim Osman, codename in the CIA, but used as the kind of fictitious boogeyman.
[00:16:37.184 --> 00:16:37.524]  Here it is.
[00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:41.886]  And a surprising assessment that shows the distance between our political cultures.
[00:16:42.206 --> 00:16:47.067]  When I asked about Osama bin Laden's latest audio tape, one of them answered with a question of her own.
[00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:49.128]  Who is Osama bin Laden?
[00:16:50.373 --> 00:16:50.613]  Who?
[00:16:51.634 --> 00:16:54.875]  He's just a character created by America.
[00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:59.396]  Actually, 98% of Pakistan would probably follow along the same line.
[00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:05.899]  They believe that Osama is basically a CIA agent who is working undercover to put a bad image of Islam.
[00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:06.859]  Really?
[00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:09.900]  So that there is no Osama bin Laden?
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.421]  A lot of them find it difficult to believe that such Muslims could actually exist.
[00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:17.763]  We could all drive an hour from where we are right now and find many, many people
[00:17:18.363 --> 00:17:23.070]  Who stand by what Osama Bin Laden says in the spirit of Islam?
[00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:26.374]  To be quite honest, that's a very marginalized section of Pakistani society.
[00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:31.321]  Islamic extremism that you find here did not really exist in Pakistan pre 9-11.
[00:17:34.716 --> 00:17:35.076]  Really?
[00:17:35.457 --> 00:17:44.282]  So that there is no Osama Bin Laden?
[00:17:44.722 --> 00:17:52.546]  In an exclusive interview with Newsweek, the CIA field commander in Tora Bora during the invasion, Gary Bernson, broke his silence.
[00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:57.469]  He explained that his intelligence operatives had tracked Bin Laden to Tora Bora.
[00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:01.191]  Mr. Bernson feels so strongly about getting this story out
[00:18:02.172 --> 00:18:08.958]  Uh, in getting his book published, that he actually resigned two years short of retirement, uh, from the CIA in order to publish his book.
[00:18:09.939 --> 00:18:16.384]  At the time of this interview, he was required to speak to his attorney until the CIA cleared his book for publication.
[00:18:18.346 --> 00:18:25.872]  At various points in time, they did have, to my understanding, definitive intelligence as to his general location within Tora Bora.
[00:18:26.844 --> 00:18:35.088]  I can't go into detail as to the actual sources of the intelligence and the collection methods because those remain classified.
[00:18:35.888 --> 00:18:46.972]  However, we had Osama Bin Laden essentially cornered in Tora Bora and for whatever reasons we did not do what was necessary in order to ensure that he did not escape.
[00:18:48.373 --> 00:18:51.995]  Of course we're after Saddam Hussein, I mean Bin Laden.
[00:18:52.035 --> 00:18:52.855]  He's isolated.
[00:18:56.204 --> 00:18:57.445]  Created by America.
[00:18:57.565 --> 00:19:09.132]  According to investigative reporter Seymour Hirsch, the Bush administration with Saudi Arabia is secretly funding radical Sunni groups, some with ties to Al-Qaeda, to counter Shia groups backed by Iran.
[00:19:09.593 --> 00:19:12.875]  A lot of them find it difficult to believe that such Muslims would actually exist.
[00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:25.423]  There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term Al-Qaeda to refer to the name of a group until after September the 11th, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given him.
[00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:40.125]  And, uh, by the way, it's important to add to this whole discussion the fact that... Well, I'll cover it when I get time on the other side.
[00:19:41.106 --> 00:19:50.212]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network, the website's yourtruthnews.us, jonesreport.com, prisonplanet.tv, and infowars.net.
[00:19:51.173 --> 00:19:55.396]  Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.621]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.262 --> 00:20:14.167]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.627 --> 00:20:21.811]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:28.016]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.128]  A new world order.
[00:20:57.168 --> 00:21:07.035]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:21:07.756 --> 00:21:13.660]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.922]  Both their objective being world domination.
[00:21:16.462 --> 00:21:18.864]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:21:19.614 --> 00:21:26.970]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:21:29.975 --> 00:21:34.958]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:38.901]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:21:39.301 --> 00:21:41.783]  Bill Burdick's making great progress toward a world government.
[00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.004]  Most people have no idea.
[00:21:43.044 --> 00:21:43.744]  They're not after money.
[00:21:43.784 --> 00:21:44.885]  They have all the money they need.
[00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:45.826]  They're after power.
[00:21:46.066 --> 00:21:47.086]  That's what I have to use it for.

[00:22:03.816 --> 00:22:07.437]  Did you know that our founding fathers gave us a Republican form of government?
[00:22:08.097 --> 00:22:11.998]  Why is all you ever hear from our leaders is that we're a democracy?

[00:22:34.115 --> 00:22:38.477]  Have you ever been told the truth about why Russian Communism seemingly has fallen?
[00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:42.139]  Why did our government let Mikhail Gorbachev come here?

[00:23:00.763 --> 00:23:02.445]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:23:02.765 --> 00:23:06.288]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:23:06.388 --> 00:23:08.250]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.613]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:23:11.914 --> 00:23:17.419]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:23:17.699 --> 00:23:21.643]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:22.980]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.543]  Like a dog without a bone and actor out of home.
[00:24:29.263 --> 00:24:30.844]  Riders on the storm.
[00:24:33.385 --> 00:24:37.667]  There's a killer on the road.
[00:24:37.827 --> 00:24:42.728]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[00:24:43.109 --> 00:24:45.709]  Take a long holiday.
[00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.331]  Let your children play.
[00:24:49.511 --> 00:24:52.352]  Alright, getting back to Huben Ladness.
[00:24:52.412 --> 00:24:55.973]  If you give this man a ride, sweet ma'am.
[00:24:55.993 --> 00:25:00.695]  Pretty much everybody in the population knows that
[00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:19.993]  Bin Laden was one of the main sons of one of the wealthiest families in Saudi Arabia, the Bin Ladens, who go back over 80 years to being members of British intelligence, back from the days when the British came in and took over Saudi Arabia and created the country.
[00:25:21.253 --> 00:25:31.595]  And they would go out and just arm Bedouin tribes, and have them go in and take over different cities and different sectors, and then set up their own imperial system there.
[00:25:32.293 --> 00:25:36.582]  And the Bin Ladens, this is mainline history, have been servants of British intel ever since.
[00:25:36.662 --> 00:25:39.508]  The British set up what is Iraq today, Kuwait.
[00:25:40.129 --> 00:25:42.875]  They drew all the lines of what is the Middle East today.
[00:25:44.967 --> 00:25:55.192]  And then they had a public strategy in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s to radicalize Muslims because the Middle East and Central Asia was westernizing.
[00:25:55.732 --> 00:25:57.513]  People were wearing suits and ties.
[00:25:57.553 --> 00:25:59.334]  There was western music on the radio.
[00:25:59.754 --> 00:26:03.676]  Women weren't, except in very rural areas, wearing the hoods over their heads.
[00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:06.518]  And that couldn't be allowed.
[00:26:07.438 --> 00:26:09.519]  Their presidents had been trained in the U.S.
[00:26:09.579 --> 00:26:11.100]  and France and England.
[00:26:12.436 --> 00:26:13.676]  And it couldn't be put up with.
[00:26:13.716 --> 00:26:34.660]  So just as they had sent in the ragtag Stone Age folks out in the desert to go and take over the cities, they went into Iran, they went into Iraq, they went into a whole score of nations, and they went and hired the most radical Muslims there were.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.480]  This is all public.
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:41.441]  And gave them the weapons to go in and undermine and destroy those countries and take them over.
[00:26:43.238 --> 00:26:44.859]  And it's the same thing today.
[00:26:45.999 --> 00:26:50.581]  And before 1979, Afghanistan was developing.
[00:26:51.141 --> 00:26:55.443]  Afghanistan was westernizing, though it was one of the more primitive countries.
[00:26:56.863 --> 00:27:11.029]  Massive Wahhabist funding had been brought in already by Saudi Arabia, a particular radical sect of the folks that are on the opposite side of the fence from the Shiites, the Sunnis.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.143]  And so they came into the nation and they radicalized them.
[00:27:15.203 --> 00:27:16.224]  Now it's been declassified.
[00:27:16.264 --> 00:27:17.866]  We already knew this.
[00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:18.686]  In 79, the U.S.
[00:27:18.707 --> 00:27:35.244]  under Carter started a covert campaign commanded by Zbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Advisor, to run attacks on the Russians in the nations north, several nations north of Afghanistan.
[00:27:36.795 --> 00:27:42.736]  When the Russians fought back and came into the country and occupied it, it was then the, quote, Holy War.
[00:27:42.776 --> 00:27:46.297]  The Jihad was... I'm not defending the Russians either.
[00:27:46.337 --> 00:27:47.637]  This is geopolitical strategy.
[00:27:48.877 --> 00:28:05.721]  They were sent in, and after a, what, seven-plus year war, the Russians were driven from the country, thanks to CIA advisors, Stinger missiles, and other weapons platforms, knocking out their different rotary
[00:28:06.588 --> 00:28:08.370]  ...type of aircraft there, helicopters.
[00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.492]  And others, small and light attack aircraft.
[00:28:12.633 --> 00:28:14.775]  So, that's what happened.
[00:28:16.416 --> 00:28:21.260]  And, then Pakistan, there's a coup in 99 that the U.S.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:21.761]  funds.
[00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:25.384]  Our own government under Clinton and Bush helped give the nukes to them.
[00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:29.647]  Then Perez Musharraf goes in and starts funding the radical Muslim groups.
[00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:34.211]  Pakistani intelligence literally runs the Taliban in the nation.
[00:28:34.251 --> 00:28:35.392]  That's mainstream news.
[00:28:36.187 --> 00:28:41.669]  Then suddenly all these people from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and other nations, thousands of them come into the U.S.
[00:28:41.689 --> 00:28:42.410]  They're trained at U.S.
[00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.350]  military bases.
[00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.392]  In every type of spying technique there is.
[00:28:47.472 --> 00:28:50.033]  They're given high-level security clearances.
[00:28:50.393 --> 00:28:52.754]  They're given terrorist cover names and stories.
[00:28:53.335 --> 00:28:55.135]  That gets in the State Department computers.
[00:28:55.476 --> 00:29:01.018]  When the State Department tries to block them going in and out of the U.S., they're told, no, these are CIA officers.
[00:29:01.538 --> 00:29:02.899]  They're here for anti-terror.
[00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:13.015]  I mean, that's all Toronto Star, Associated Press, Newsweek, Pensacola News Journal, the San Jose Mercury News.
[00:29:13.035 --> 00:29:14.295]  I mean, it's in my films.
[00:29:14.695 --> 00:29:15.436]  Don't believe me.
[00:29:15.656 --> 00:29:18.176]  It's all hidden in plain view.
[00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:20.737]  This stuff all comes out and then gets clamped down.
[00:29:22.358 --> 00:29:29.820]  And then you talk about the 5,000 Iraqis brought in by Bush, 41, and then Clinton.
[00:29:31.132 --> 00:29:39.558]  Who are involved in OKC, who also have national security clearances, and are also designated as agents, and they're waiting in every U.S.
[00:29:39.578 --> 00:29:40.239]  city, folks.
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.243]  They get one word, one button, one button's pushed, they're released.
[00:29:47.284 --> 00:29:49.565]  Okay, we'll talk about what that'll look like when we get back.
[00:29:51.727 --> 00:29:54.709]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.332]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:08.695 --> 00:31:10.036]  But the symptoms are there.

[00:31:28.624 --> 00:31:32.986]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:35.287]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:35.387 --> 00:31:42.090]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio back.
[00:31:44.656 --> 00:31:47.697]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're gonna start taking this hemp.
[00:31:47.717 --> 00:31:48.737]  I say go to hempusa.org.
[00:32:10.945 --> 00:32:15.387]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm gonna say it anyway.
[00:32:15.727 --> 00:32:17.847]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[00:32:18.188 --> 00:32:20.348]  They keep you down, they keep you blue.
[00:32:20.628 --> 00:32:23.529]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:27.631]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[00:32:28.011 --> 00:32:33.393]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:39.829]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song, for the heart of America wants this one.
[00:32:39.869 --> 00:32:43.491]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:32:44.712 --> 00:32:49.595]  If you're a truther, an anarchist, a renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[00:32:49.655 --> 00:32:54.118]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:32:54.158 --> 00:32:56.299]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states.
[00:32:56.379 --> 00:32:57.159]  Go to hempusa.org.
[00:33:02.358 --> 00:33:06.225]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:33:10.051 --> 00:33:11.694]  No matter how hard you...
[00:33:33.816 --> 00:33:37.117]  Coming up in about five minutes, we're going to take your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:37.137 --> 00:33:37.197]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:11.151]  And then I'm going to continue to get into all the other news that I have here in front of me.
[00:34:11.251 --> 00:34:11.652]  Okay.
[00:34:13.513 --> 00:34:18.615]  For the next five minutes or so, we're going to be talking to Debbie Marra of New Millennium Concepts.
[00:34:18.735 --> 00:34:20.936]  The holidays are coming up.
[00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:21.416]  They're here.
[00:34:22.397 --> 00:34:30.901]  And I have given more than 10 Big Berkey and Black Berkey Element Systems to friends and family.
[00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:31.981]  I use it in my home.
[00:34:32.081 --> 00:34:33.202]  I use it in my office.
[00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:39.609]  I use it in the bathroom, you know, the kids get up at night so they don't drink out of the sink without going to the kitchen.
[00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.913]  Look, the water is filled with herbicides, pesticides, lead, mercury, arsenic.
[00:34:46.634 --> 00:34:51.637]  Go to the EPA's own websites and look at allowable toxins in the water.
[00:34:52.178 --> 00:34:58.042]  Once you've been drinking truly purified water, I don't even mean the bottled water crud, there's been a lot of reports on how bad that is.
[00:34:58.664 --> 00:35:01.805]  You know, just municipal water they put through some charcoal filters to make it taste better.
[00:35:02.265 --> 00:35:12.167]  When you've been drinking real purified water from a true purification system, it is unlike anything you've had before, and then you can't go back to drinking tap water.
[00:35:12.607 --> 00:35:15.028]  I just can't do it, even when there's ice cubes in it and lemon.
[00:35:15.688 --> 00:35:22.630]  Sometimes I'm out of town and may drink a glass of tap water and it just tastes horrible, especially if you live in these big cities.
[00:35:23.334 --> 00:35:34.277]  Places like Houston, Texas with all the refineries and all the cars and all the runoff, not to mention the sodium and stannous fluoride they're putting in the water, which has been proven to be very, very bad for your body, your bones.
[00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:39.827]  So the holidays are here, and they've got some holiday specials that they're running right now.
[00:35:40.508 --> 00:35:45.392]  And if you haven't gotten a high-quality filtration system, by the way, you're getting wholesale prices from them.
[00:35:45.412 --> 00:35:46.313]  You know, a $350 unit's like $240.
[00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:48.315]  A $200 unit from New Millennium would be like $275 at a camping supply store.
[00:35:55.131 --> 00:35:56.172]  More preparedness outfit.
[00:35:56.452 --> 00:36:08.381]  You're going right to the manufacturer of the American Berkey line, and right to the national distributor of the British Berkey, and you're getting what distributors pay, who buy them by the hundreds in some cases.
[00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:11.964]  So it's another great deal for our audience and I really do believe in it.
[00:36:12.344 --> 00:36:13.125]  Debbie, how you doing?
[00:36:13.665 --> 00:36:18.166]  Well, I have a little bit of a frog in my throat, but other than that, I'm doing great.
[00:36:18.486 --> 00:36:22.027]  Everybody I know has either got allergies or got a cold right now.
[00:36:22.327 --> 00:36:23.747]  Yeah, well, God is healing me.
[00:36:23.827 --> 00:36:25.307]  I'm almost better, thank you.
[00:36:25.327 --> 00:36:27.228]  Guess what?
[00:36:27.248 --> 00:36:33.249]  I have a really neat thing going with your customers who call in and say they're an Alex Jones listener.
[00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:39.350]  Not only do they get, like, if they order a Royal Berkey, this is a special on Royal Berkeys,
[00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:49.782]  If they order a Royal Berkey, they get the Berkey Sport Bottles for say they're an Alex Jones Listener or a Bass or a bottle of Potassium Iodate.
[00:36:50.403 --> 00:36:57.567]  But from now until the end of the year, they get a second Sport Berkey, the generic label one.
[00:36:57.607 --> 00:36:59.568]  So not only do they get one, they get two.
[00:36:59.588 --> 00:37:01.649]  So that's really good.
[00:37:02.709 --> 00:37:05.551]  We wanted to encourage people to order the Royal Berkeys.
[00:37:06.167 --> 00:37:13.109]  So, um, that's a good way to do it and get an extra, you know, extra holiday gift to give away to somebody.
[00:37:13.369 --> 00:37:18.170]  Now explain what a Royal Berkey is and explain what the sports bottles are.
[00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.110]  Oh, okay.
[00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.811]  Well, a Royal Berkey is our stainless steel Berkey.
[00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:28.132]  They come in five sizes and the Royal is really the best size, I think.
[00:37:28.232 --> 00:37:29.612]  It's the middle size.
[00:37:30.093 --> 00:37:31.973]  It holds three and a quarter gallons.
[00:37:32.637 --> 00:37:34.178]  And up to four filters.
[00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:41.824]  We're making this special available with just a two-filter system, which is only a $275 system.
[00:37:42.465 --> 00:37:44.987]  And you get one free gift with it normally.
[00:37:45.087 --> 00:37:50.151]  So you would get a second one if you order it between now and the first of the year.
[00:37:50.171 --> 00:38:02.140]  And what it has is the Black-Berkey purification elements in it, which are the ones that take out the pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and sediment to a non-detectable level.
[00:38:02.779 --> 00:38:03.079]  Thank you.
[00:38:20.894 --> 00:38:22.695]  And hold three and a quarter gallons.
[00:38:22.875 --> 00:38:28.459]  So, you know, when you have holiday company, you know, and things like that, you're not going to be likely to run out of water.
[00:38:28.479 --> 00:38:31.401]  But then on the other end of that, you have the sports Berkey.
[00:38:32.362 --> 00:38:33.062]  How much does it hold?
[00:38:33.883 --> 00:38:39.006]  The sport Berkeys hold 22 ounces, and they are the generic labeled ones.
[00:38:39.047 --> 00:38:40.708]  Some people look at them on our website.
[00:38:40.728 --> 00:38:42.329]  They just don't have writing on them.
[00:38:42.929 --> 00:38:45.431]  They're the same bottle and everything.
[00:38:45.571 --> 00:38:48.133]  Well, I guess when I say sport Berkey, I mean travel Berkey.
[00:38:48.273 --> 00:38:49.834]  It's the little travel Berkey, correct.
[00:38:50.627 --> 00:38:52.289]  No, no, no.
[00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:53.390]  It's the Sport Berkey.
[00:38:53.751 --> 00:38:54.932]  It's the 22-ounce one.
[00:38:54.952 --> 00:38:57.935]  The Travel Berkey is stainless steel.
[00:38:58.376 --> 00:39:02.440]  It's the Sport Berkey and it's for when you're on the go.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.503]  You know, you can keep it in your car, you can put it in your purse.
[00:39:05.663 --> 00:39:09.948]  Now, you've also got a deal on the sports bottles, which again, just make the water safe.
[00:39:10.555 --> 00:39:14.676]  You can do 100 and something refills of swamp water, 600 and something of tap water.
[00:39:15.036 --> 00:39:23.958]  It reduces almost all of it, but you can't call it a purifier because an electron microscope can still find, not bacteria cuts all those out, but other things like chemicals.
[00:39:24.338 --> 00:39:25.718]  So it just massively reduces it.
[00:39:25.758 --> 00:39:30.799]  That's great for your business, great when you're at work, great whenever you're, of course, at the gym.
[00:39:31.159 --> 00:39:32.680]  Here is the number, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:40.445]  Well, you know, we've been discussing that and we're really hoping that we can get orders,
[00:40:03.154 --> 00:40:15.725]  You know Christmas is on Tuesday the 25th so if we have retail customers call in as late as I would say Tuesday the 18th
[00:40:17.393 --> 00:40:23.618]  If we have to, we can ship it third day air at just $10 extra, which is really not bad at all.
[00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:25.519]  Okay, Debbie, let me give people the number.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:26.901]  That's good.
[00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:28.222]  That's good news.
[00:40:28.242 --> 00:40:28.562]  888-803-4438.
[00:40:28.582 --> 00:40:40.311]  888-803-4438 or order at Berkeywater.com and tell them Alex Jones sent you in the comment box and tell them which free gift they want.
[00:40:40.351 --> 00:40:41.472]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:40:41.712 --> 00:40:42.873]  Thank you very much.
[00:40:42.933 --> 00:40:44.434]  Have a wonderful day, Alex.
[00:40:44.614 --> 00:40:45.195]  You too, Debbie.
[00:40:45.835 --> 00:40:53.161]  Again, she can take your orders up until the 18th with regular shipping, get it days before Christmas, or if you pay $10 more, they can ship it to you three-day air.
[00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:58.985]  Let me give you that number, 888-803-4438, or Berkeywater.com.
[00:40:59.706 --> 00:41:01.928]  Okay, let's go ahead now and go to some of your calls.
[00:41:01.968 --> 00:41:09.734]  Let's have open phones, and then I'm going to get into Senate approval of a pact
[00:41:10.902 --> 00:41:12.123]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:19.986]  In regards to this Anglo-American establishment thing that's been going on, I guess you're quite aware of the international, the Royal International
[00:41:35.399 --> 00:41:36.399]  International Affairs.
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.041]  The Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[00:41:39.301 --> 00:41:43.323]  Yeah, well, they've been working in Khrushchev since their inception.
[00:41:43.523 --> 00:41:47.425]  But here's a quote from Arnold Toynbee that was quoted back in 31.
[00:41:47.485 --> 00:41:52.627]  The original source is the trend for international
[00:41:53.307 --> 00:41:57.288]  These people have no compulsion about lying, if it's a means to the end they will do it.
[00:42:18.243 --> 00:42:18.764]  I don't think so.
[00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.592]  John 844, they're the father of the devil.
[00:42:32.772 --> 00:42:34.373]  They're liars from the beginning, murderers.
[00:42:34.573 --> 00:42:36.574]  So that would be the biblical reference.
[00:42:36.594 --> 00:42:37.375]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:42:37.415 --> 00:42:43.758]  I mean, you read that quote, and I've seen that quote, and we actually had the publication was originally made in, you know, decades and decades ago.
[00:42:44.379 --> 00:42:49.742]  I mean, Cecil Rhodes wrote best-selling books about how they were going to set up a global British empire and have fronts that did it.
[00:42:50.302 --> 00:42:57.086]  And this has now happened today, and the CFR has got hundreds of quotes out where they say they're going to lie to the public.
[00:42:57.126 --> 00:42:58.167]  I mean, this is what they do.
[00:42:58.829 --> 00:43:05.553]  Well, it's just even with someone that has such a stellar view with this Winston Churchill.
[00:43:06.533 --> 00:43:10.736]  All his adult career, he was a Mason and a Druid.
[00:43:11.376 --> 00:43:14.338]  He precipitated the sinking of the Lusitania.
[00:43:15.118 --> 00:43:15.919]  He was involved with
[00:43:18.091 --> 00:43:24.356]  215,000 British troops being killed in World War I at Galapagos.
[00:43:25.356 --> 00:43:30.981]  My source is the Brotherhood of Darkness book, of course, and also Dennis Cuddy.
[00:43:31.591 --> 00:43:34.474]  Uh, newswithfuse.com is one of the best researchers out there.
[00:43:34.494 --> 00:43:36.156]  I sure wish she'd get Dennis on sometime.
[00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:37.918]  Yeah, we've had Dennis on about ten times.
[00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:48.750]  Uh, I do know that, uh, if it wasn't for you guys getting the information out, uh, we just, uh, just another thing, in two days we're going to be celebrating the World War, uh, what is it, Pearl Harbor?
[00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:49.091]  Yeah.
[00:43:49.391 --> 00:43:52.675]  Uh, well, I guess you know about with, uh, uh, Tyler
[00:43:53.277 --> 00:44:07.726]  Tyler Kent, and he's trying to feed information to the Senate and the Congress back before World War II about what was the secret decoded messages that he was deciphering for Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill.
[00:44:07.987 --> 00:44:09.588]  He was arrested in England.
[00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:13.790]  That source is... There's another good source out there.
[00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:15.631]  Sir, it's well known about the Pearl Harbor.
[00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:16.752]  Thank you for the call, Frank.
[00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:18.713]  Interesting points there.
[00:44:18.854 --> 00:44:20.114]  John in California.
[00:44:20.134 --> 00:44:20.615]  You're on the air.
[00:44:20.675 --> 00:44:20.975]  Go ahead.
[00:44:22.102 --> 00:44:23.023]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:44:23.103 --> 00:44:23.343]  Good.
[00:44:23.363 --> 00:44:28.245]  Hey, so last night we were at that straw poll in San Francisco.
[00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:29.126]  Did you hear about it?
[00:44:29.626 --> 00:44:31.447]  Yes, I covered it right at the start of the show.
[00:44:31.527 --> 00:44:37.791]  San Francisco GOP cancelled straw poll after Ron Paul supporters pour in from Lou Rockwell.
[00:44:38.091 --> 00:44:38.691]  Tell us about it.
[00:44:39.652 --> 00:44:42.874]  I uploaded, I actually have the video of it.
[00:44:42.954 --> 00:44:46.896]  You know, the spirit of this Ron Paul campaign is just
[00:44:48.183 --> 00:44:56.705]  I met a guy on the phone last night who spent the night adjusting the light levels and then compressing the video so that we could all see it.
[00:44:56.765 --> 00:44:58.066]  It's on YouTube right now.
[00:44:58.086 --> 00:45:06.008]  If you just search for San Francisco Straw Poll, DEC4, December 4, you should be able to find it.
[00:45:06.908 --> 00:45:15.971]  And to add to the surrealism of the event, the woman who was running it was wearing a Santa hat throughout the whole time and proceeded to
[00:45:16.997 --> 00:45:21.919]  With a number of incomprehensible reasons as to why they couldn't conduct the straw poll.
[00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:26.501]  Mainly so that we wouldn't offend the other guests who were going to lose.
[00:45:28.241 --> 00:45:29.702]  Well, that's political correctness.
[00:45:29.822 --> 00:45:31.182]  Oh, we have to ban your speech.
[00:45:31.222 --> 00:45:37.985]  In fact, I have a mainstream article where a Santa was fired from a store because he was going, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[00:45:38.005 --> 00:45:39.746]  People thought he was calling women whores.
[00:45:40.326 --> 00:45:41.926]  And, I mean, this is just political correctness.
[00:45:41.966 --> 00:45:42.727]  No free speech.
[00:45:43.247 --> 00:45:46.248]  Just cops running around in black uniforms everywhere, tasering everyone.
[00:45:46.934 --> 00:45:52.796]  I find it ironic that here we are, the Republican Party has been trying to export democracy, and we can't even run a straw poll.
[00:45:52.896 --> 00:45:55.837]  They're complete and total New World Order shills, the lot of them.
[00:45:56.917 --> 00:46:02.899]  I mean, this country is run by a pack of, an army of parasites, and they're not going to let us rest control without a fight.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:11.601]  Alex, the interesting thing about it is that the woman, when you see this woman talking, I mean, she clearly is not a mover and shaker in the Republican Party.
[00:46:11.942 --> 00:46:13.262]  I mean, she's been told to do this.
[00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:24.879]  And when you combine that with the irregularities of the Mitt Romney straw poll... So she openly says, and I know the Lou Rockwell reports this, but she openly says, well, since Ron Paul's gonna win, that'll hurt other people's feelings.
[00:46:25.179 --> 00:46:27.901]  We're just not gonna... That's the whole point of a straw poll, to see who wins.
[00:46:28.601 --> 00:46:30.863]  Well, you are a lot more comprehensible than she was just now.
[00:46:30.923 --> 00:46:33.064]  And look, the video speaks for itself.
[00:46:33.364 --> 00:46:34.585]  Go to YouTube and check it out.
[00:46:35.046 --> 00:46:38.228]  I have an account on there, it's called I'm a Ron Paul Republican.
[00:46:38.488 --> 00:46:39.709]  Try searching it that way.
[00:46:40.219 --> 00:46:44.201]  But I mean, when I get off there, I can talk to one of you guys.
[00:46:44.221 --> 00:46:48.484]  When I get to my stop, I'll shoot you a link as soon as I can.
[00:46:48.864 --> 00:46:50.805]  Are you cell phone calling me on Skype?
[00:46:52.706 --> 00:46:52.886]  No.
[00:46:53.327 --> 00:46:57.889]  No, I'm cell phone calling you, but no, I'm actually using an iPhone.
[00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.451]  No, it's just bad audio.
[00:47:00.491 --> 00:47:01.371]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[00:47:01.412 --> 00:47:01.692]  Yeah.
[00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:02.972]  Send us the info.
[00:47:03.633 --> 00:47:05.434]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in Florida.
[00:47:05.454 --> 00:47:06.254]  Jim, you're on the air.
[00:47:06.274 --> 00:47:07.235]  Hey, Alex.
[00:47:07.275 --> 00:47:07.315]  Hi.
[00:47:10.074 --> 00:47:17.016]  On Friday, you were talking about how hard it is to explain to people about McVeigh's role in Oklahoma City because they don't believe in mind control.
[00:47:17.677 --> 00:47:22.758]  Just remind them of what a group of rank amateurs was able to do to Patricia Hurst in a very short time.
[00:47:23.418 --> 00:47:23.799]  That's right.
[00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:27.700]  They had her joining the Black Panther Party.
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.761]  No, no, it was the Sudanese Liberation Army.
[00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:33.942]  They had her joining that and totally brainwashed in a matter of weeks.
[00:47:34.522 --> 00:47:36.183]  And then, of course, look at Jim Jones.
[00:47:36.283 --> 00:47:37.203]  Look at all these people.
[00:47:37.944 --> 00:47:43.728]  Yeah, but anybody who is, you know, in their 40s by now remembers the Patricia Hearst thing.
[00:47:43.768 --> 00:47:46.490]  We were like, hello, you used to own that bank robbery, you know?
[00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:51.213]  But a lot of people now are aware of the truth of 9-11.
[00:47:51.314 --> 00:47:56.077]  I think a lot of people now would be prepared to start listening to Oklahoma City Truth.
[00:47:58.209 --> 00:48:05.851]  Well, I mean, it's come out in mainstream papers and in depositions that they've got from Nichols that McVeigh said he worked for the U.S.
[00:48:05.891 --> 00:48:06.291]  government.
[00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:07.592]  We already knew that.
[00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:16.674]  We already knew, and it's come out now in documents via lawsuits, that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the Elohim City training compound.
[00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:18.443]  I mean, it never ends.
[00:48:18.463 --> 00:48:25.388]  The FBI and the First World Trade Center started the group, cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, told them where to park it, gave them the detonators.
[00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.710]  Their own informants said, I thought this was a sting.
[00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:28.951]  I'm not going to be involved in the bombing.
[00:48:28.971 --> 00:48:29.792]  And they said, stand down.
[00:48:29.832 --> 00:48:30.673]  The bombing goes forward.
[00:48:31.913 --> 00:48:32.574]  Yeah.
[00:48:33.255 --> 00:48:40.740]  You know, the election's in 11 months, and I don't think Hillary Clinton wants a populist who's well-informed on Oklahoma City truth at that time.
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:41.381]  What do you think?
[00:48:42.845 --> 00:48:45.306]  No, and we need to discredit her as well.
[00:48:45.366 --> 00:48:47.247]  We need to discredit both the political parties.
[00:48:48.368 --> 00:48:49.348]  Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:48:49.648 --> 00:48:57.192]  I just was wondering if you guys could throw up a one-page flyer of Oklahoma City Truth for dummies or something like that, you know?
[00:48:57.412 --> 00:49:01.194]  Yeah, I mean, how about you guys write it up, and if it's accurate, I'll post it.
[00:49:02.014 --> 00:49:04.395]  Okay, well, I'm sure there's other people out there.
[00:49:04.435 --> 00:49:08.457]  Maybe you can get several possibilities and work up one out of the group of them.
[00:49:08.797 --> 00:49:09.838]  Yeah, thank you for the call.
[00:49:10.258 --> 00:49:10.878]  Appreciate it.
[00:49:10.898 --> 00:49:11.679]  A lot we'd like to do.
[00:49:13.234 --> 00:49:14.035]  Who's up next here?
[00:49:15.855 --> 00:49:17.096]  Don in Texas, go ahead.
[00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:20.017]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:20.277]  Good.
[00:49:21.237 --> 00:49:25.639]  I was just wondering if you've heard of the movie getting ready to come out, Charlie Wilson's War?
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.081]  I have heard a little bit about it.
[00:49:29.101 --> 00:49:30.141]  I don't know the particulars.
[00:49:32.462 --> 00:49:35.923]  It's about the congressman going and creating the Taliban.
[00:49:38.379 --> 00:49:39.760]  Was it at Taliban or Al-Qaeda?
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:40.961]  I know it was the movie.
[00:49:41.241 --> 00:49:49.228]  Basically everything that you said at the beginning of the broadcast about how they funded Afghanistan to fight against the Soviets, that's the plot of the movie.
[00:49:49.608 --> 00:49:54.292]  And so everything that you're discussing is getting ready to be released as a mainstream movie.
[00:49:54.332 --> 00:49:57.454]  And then people email me and say, I got it from a movie.
[00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.616]  Oh, it's absurd.
[00:49:59.676 --> 00:50:02.278]  What I was wondering is, originally it was a book.
[00:50:03.138 --> 00:50:23.925]  Uh, if you knew anything about, uh, Charlie Wilson, the congressman, and how he was an alcoholic, and how, you know, basically it was just a... It's now widely known, that's kind of my point, is that... Well, you're also implying that, because I have read the synopsis of the film, at first I didn't register, uh, that, uh, it's a big whitewash saying that he ran it all and he did it all.
[00:50:24.585 --> 00:50:25.966]  That's what I was thinking.
[00:50:26.566 --> 00:50:28.907]  Yeah, that, they're, they're gonna whitewash it in that way.
[00:50:30.154 --> 00:50:35.856]  Yeah, long before Wilson was sent by Reagan, it was going on with Jimmy Carter and Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:50:36.177 --> 00:50:39.418]  Brzezinski's written a best-selling book bragging about it all, how he ran the whole thing.
[00:50:40.378 --> 00:50:40.658]  Wow.
[00:50:40.839 --> 00:50:42.259]  And Operation Cyclone.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.400]  Thank you very much.
[00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:45.160]  Thank you.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:49.782]  Yeah, I mean, you know, and Robert De Niro makes the Skull and Bones movie, and it's a big whitewash.
[00:50:49.802 --> 00:50:54.084]  I mean, it shows the devil worship and stuff, but it's still a whitewash.
[00:50:54.624 --> 00:50:55.885]  Warrior calls straight ahead.
[00:50:55.925 --> 00:50:58.426]  We've got Pat Buchanan coming up later, and Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:04.199]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.

[00:51:48.964 --> 00:51:59.547]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue, with never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest
[00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.950]  I'm good.

[00:54:40.288 --> 00:54:42.190]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:48.756]  A big, big guest on the show tomorrow.
[00:54:51.918 --> 00:54:57.143]  And you'll definitely want to tune in for that on the Thursday edition, 6th of December, 2007.
[00:54:57.203 --> 00:54:58.364]  It is the 5th of December, 2007.
[00:54:58.404 --> 00:54:59.085]  Today
[00:55:05.313 --> 00:55:14.760]  I'm going to continue with open phones into the next hour, then we are scheduled, and I don't know, I think I've interviewed him, I forget, is it three or four times over the years?
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.022]  He's always shown up, but it's a big guess.
[00:55:17.042 --> 00:55:17.762]  We'll see what happens.
[00:55:18.283 --> 00:55:30.872]  Patrick J. Buchanan is scheduled to be on with us in 30 minutes to talk about his new book, Day of Reckoning, How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart.
[00:55:32.486 --> 00:55:46.677]  Because we continue to bring you the big guest with the important historical lens to basically see where our society is going and hopefully how we can save this constitutional republic.
[00:55:49.439 --> 00:55:57.405]  I am not going to belabor this this hour because I want to go back to your calls, Brendan in New York and others, that are patiently holding
[00:55:58.311 --> 00:56:01.913]  But my new documentary, Endgame, is my best work.
[00:56:02.353 --> 00:56:04.894]  And it's two hours, 20 minutes long, with 40 minutes of extras.
[00:56:05.494 --> 00:56:16.959]  It covers the history of the global system, who the New World Order is, what they set up, the North American Union, how it's coming together, how they set up the EU, the Asian Union, the African Union, how they're all being integrated.
[00:56:17.059 --> 00:56:20.500]  And then the second half is eugenics and what makes them tick.
[00:56:21.391 --> 00:56:33.077]  And how they really have an ideology of hatred of their fellow man, and just an absolute greediness and selfishness taken to the penultimate end of mass extermination.
[00:56:33.177 --> 00:56:34.778]  It is a film everybody needs to see!
[00:56:35.818 --> 00:56:47.524]  And I'm asking you, if you do have Endgame, if you did buy the DVD, or did download a high quality copy, at PrisonPlanet.tv, burn that sucker to disk, give that to everybody you know, or if you want to give nice stocking stuffers,
[00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:49.939]  Christmas is almost here.
[00:56:50.019 --> 00:56:51.080]  Now is the time to order.

[00:57:02.223 --> 00:57:04.103]  Get Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:57:04.123 --> 00:57:06.784]  And when you get it, you can get Endgame discounted.
[00:57:07.384 --> 00:57:09.225]  When you get it with loose change Final Cut.
[00:57:09.245 --> 00:57:13.446]  We also have Endgame discounted with Dr. Coursey's book, Late Great USA.
[00:57:15.803 --> 00:57:25.909]  You need to be emissaries, ambassadors, diplomats for the cause of liberty and freedom and humanity and free humanity against the globalists by going out and taking Endgame.
[00:57:25.949 --> 00:57:29.431]  You can get Endgame as low as $10.95 when you get multiple copies.
[00:57:29.491 --> 00:57:32.392]  Buy 4 or 5 copies, 10 copies, 20 copies, 100 copies.
[00:57:33.293 --> 00:57:35.614]  And give it to everybody you know and say, here's your present.
[00:57:35.634 --> 00:57:36.855]  It's a pretty wild film.
[00:57:37.335 --> 00:57:37.995]  Pretty scary.
[00:57:38.035 --> 00:57:39.156]  Tell me what you think of it.
[00:57:40.197 --> 00:57:41.638]  Controversial documentary.
[00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:43.219]  I wouldn't even push politics on them.
[00:57:43.279 --> 00:57:46.101]  I'd just come back and see what they think, see what they say.
[00:57:46.381 --> 00:57:48.543]  About half the people that see it will totally wake up.
[00:57:48.883 --> 00:57:50.164]  Another half will be undecided.
[00:57:50.204 --> 00:57:53.626]  But down the road, those seeds are planted.
[00:57:54.278 --> 00:57:59.803]  This stuff doesn't happen overnight, and I just want Endgame, Blueprint for Global, and Slave Banana Loose Change Final Cut to be seen.
[00:58:00.203 --> 00:58:01.444]  Both these films need to be seen.
[00:58:01.464 --> 00:58:06.648]  They're both available right now at Infowars.com, or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:58:06.869 --> 00:58:07.209]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:07.249 --> 00:58:15.996]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, and get your letters in in the next few days so we get them in time to get it out to you.
[00:58:16.016 --> 00:58:18.218]  The letters need to happen in the next few days.
[00:58:22.261 --> 00:58:27.005]  3,001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:27.125 --> 00:58:35.231]  All right, we're going to come back after this quick 70-second break and go straight to your calls.
[00:58:35.851 --> 00:58:40.895]  Oh, and by the way, we have the Christmas special for prisonplanet.tv, three months free.
[00:58:43.097 --> 00:58:44.458]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.518 --> 00:58:47.000]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:59.125 --> 00:59:03.306]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:03.967 --> 00:59:04.767]  You want answers?
[00:59:05.527 --> 00:59:07.448]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:07.468 --> 00:59:10.729]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:11.289 --> 00:59:15.371]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.493 --> 00:59:30.915]  Alright, we're scheduled to have Pat Buchanan with his new book, Day of Reckoning, joining us in 30 minutes.
[00:59:31.375 --> 00:59:39.797]  And we've got Dr. Jerome Corsi to analyze all the incredible disinformation and spin from the news media, claiming there's no such thing as even a trans-Texas corridor.
[00:59:39.837 --> 00:59:41.178]  I mean, that's all over our news.
[00:59:41.218 --> 00:59:48.320]  They got billboards up saying trans-Texas corridor everywhere.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.181]  I mean, it's really getting crazy.
[00:59:50.701 --> 00:59:53.062]  But they know the general public doesn't look into it.
[00:59:53.682 --> 00:59:54.462]  So they just lie.
[00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:57.711]  I mean, imagine cops out there driving along all day.
[00:59:57.751 --> 01:00:01.172]  They see these Trans-Texas Corridor... What's the name of the website?
[01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:06.695]  Uh, billboards everywhere with a guy with a cowboy hat on it saying how great it is.
[01:00:08.476 --> 01:00:11.257]  Bus drivers, people that... There's got to be 20 of these in Austin.
[01:00:11.757 --> 01:00:14.978]  I mean, it's... Look how they treat you like idiots!
[01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:17.799]  This system is criminal!
[01:00:20.601 --> 01:00:23.642]  Brendan in New York, you're on the air, sir.
[01:00:25.419 --> 01:00:29.144]  Hi Alex, I just have a few minutes left on my phone, so I might get cut off at some point here.
[01:00:29.344 --> 01:00:30.345]  Just go ahead and hit us.
[01:00:30.826 --> 01:00:33.189]  I was wondering if you caught Lou Dodds on Democracy Now!
[01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:33.669]  yesterday.
[01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:35.331]  No, I didn't catch it.
[01:00:36.172 --> 01:00:37.934]  He was there for the entire hour.
[01:00:37.954 --> 01:00:40.798]  They talked about the immigration issue.
[01:00:41.551 --> 01:00:51.295]  And it was interesting, towards the end of the episode, someone mentioned the North American Union, and one of the co-anchors on the show just completely denied its existence.
[01:00:51.755 --> 01:00:57.017]  And then today, on today's episode of Democracy Now!, they had a gentleman from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:00:57.617 --> 01:01:02.519]  Let me get a saying that if you talk about the NAU, it's a code word for hurting blacks.
[01:01:03.377 --> 01:01:05.202]  And for hurting any minority, it seems like.
[01:01:05.222 --> 01:01:07.026]  In this case, Latinos.
[01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:12.340]  Their headline today is, uh, FBI statistics show anti-Latino hate crimes on the rise.
[01:01:13.035 --> 01:01:16.177]  And it's all statistics from the Southern Poverty Law Commission.
[01:01:16.217 --> 01:01:19.380]  The folks that brought you Elohim City, the command base.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:26.825]  It just seems like they're really confusing this issue with anti-immigration.
[01:01:27.045 --> 01:01:35.611]  When we had Chinese spies and Chinese generals running the Commerce Department, CNN would say it was racism against Asians to talk about it.
[01:01:36.111 --> 01:01:38.353]  They treat the public like complete morons.
[01:01:39.193 --> 01:01:47.940]  It's incredible to me because I go to Democracy Now!, I go to Pacifica Radio, you know, as a legitimate source of news, and it just, it really shocked me.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.681]  Sir, it's all Ford Foundation run.
[01:01:50.102 --> 01:01:52.344]  Yeah, I've looked into that a little bit.
[01:01:52.524 --> 01:01:58.368]  They admit of some of the things that are happening, but then give fraudulent solutions to it all.
[01:01:58.468 --> 01:02:01.451]  More government, more corporate controlled crime syndicate.
[01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:04.773]  I mean, the government is a tool of the multinationals.
[01:02:07.003 --> 01:02:14.389]  It seems like they've thrown a little bit of truth in there, and they say, see, look here, you can't deny this, and then they just tie up all this other misinformation.
[01:02:14.409 --> 01:02:15.811]  Well, what do you think Glenn Beck does?
[01:02:15.851 --> 01:02:21.856]  He'll get on and say, law of the sea treaty is totally evil, new order takeover is horrible, let's arrest Ron Paul supporters.
[01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:26.969]  And neither the Anchor for Democracy Now nor Lou Dobbs brought it up.
[01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:35.776]  And when the North American Union was finally brought up at the end of yesterday's episode, Juan Gonzalez, he just kind of sneered at it.
[01:02:35.976 --> 01:02:41.640]  And they really, I don't know, it was interesting, they didn't talk about it, they jumped directly to the Minutemen.
[01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:44.002]  They talked about all these other issues.
[01:02:44.022 --> 01:02:45.743]  Yeah, that guilt by association.
[01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:51.307]  I've noticed they'll have newscasts about child molesters, and then they'll have the next piece is about the Minutemen.
[01:02:51.947 --> 01:02:55.488]  Or they'll have a... I mean, it's all psychological warfare.
[01:02:56.048 --> 01:03:00.570]  And I mean, do the citizens out there listening think it's cute or fun to have this done against us?
[01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:14.454]  You have to look at the money, you have to look at, you know, the fact that every dollar that's issued is loaned, and that, you know, there's a lot of key issues which just seem to get lost.
[01:03:14.955 --> 01:03:18.776]  Look, Amy Goodman, the person that runs Democracy Now!,
[01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:25.264]  Was there during the countdown and was told to get back, they were going to blow up building 7, you see her start running and then it blows up.
[01:03:25.284 --> 01:03:34.448]  I mean, we've talked to the emergency workers who were there, we've interviewed them, while the countdown was going and she's told, you see her listening, and then she starts running.
[01:03:34.528 --> 01:03:35.889]  I mean, you know, give me a break.
[01:03:36.569 --> 01:03:37.129]  Give me a break.
[01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:39.871]  Excuse me?
[01:03:40.351 --> 01:03:41.472]  How can they not speak up?
[01:03:41.512 --> 01:03:42.672]  How can they not, you know?
[01:03:43.272 --> 01:03:44.833]  She's living in a penthouse, man!
[01:03:44.853 --> 01:03:47.314]  A lot of people aren't easy to buy.
[01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:48.395]  Be right back.

[01:05:55.001 --> 01:05:59.522]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:05:59.682 --> 01:06:02.803]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:04.923]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:06:05.183 --> 01:06:07.264]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:13.565]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:06:13.765 --> 01:06:19.046]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:06:19.306 --> 01:06:22.167]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.

[01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:59.735]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:18.664 --> 01:07:26.486]  Continuing with your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen, as we await Pat Buchanan joining us, and then, of course, Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:07:28.267 --> 01:07:43.932]  Every day I'm sent, I don't know, 10, 15, 20, depends on the day, different state documents, federal documents on their own websites, announcements, photos of billboards, clips of the heads of different legislatures in the U.S.
[01:07:43.992 --> 01:07:44.632]  and Canada,
[01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:50.312]  Announcing the North American Union, announcing the Trade Corridors, announcing the NAFTA Superhighways.
[01:07:50.812 --> 01:07:52.452]  I mean, here's just one of them today.
[01:07:54.573 --> 01:07:58.214]  And this is from Infrastructure and Transportation, Alberta Government.
[01:07:58.694 --> 01:08:00.855]  See, just up there, they don't even deny any of it.
[01:08:01.255 --> 01:08:02.715]  NAFTA Trade Corridors.
[01:08:03.876 --> 01:08:07.157]  And it shows the NAFTA, it calls it NAFTA Superhighway.
[01:08:07.177 --> 01:08:11.318]  Uh, is the one that goes through Texas.
[01:08:11.678 --> 01:08:14.199]  Uh, the other big, massive one is Canamax.
[01:08:15.345 --> 01:08:33.751]  Then they call another one just Interstate 5, and then Camino Real is one that comes out of the Mexico border up into New Mexico, into Colorado, and then on up into Canada, right up through Wyoming and Montana on that border.
[01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:35.691]  But, I mean, this is what I mean.
[01:08:35.731 --> 01:08:38.472]  I'm literally just grounding in documents.
[01:08:38.552 --> 01:08:41.254]  And you're just emailing them en masse, keep it up.
[01:08:41.274 --> 01:08:46.997]  I mean, no one, no one person could track hundreds of federal agencies in each country.
[01:08:47.017 --> 01:08:48.898]  I don't know if Mexico has hundreds.
[01:08:48.938 --> 01:08:52.220]  I know Canada has hundreds of different agencies and sub-agencies.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:52.860]  I know the U.S.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.020]  does.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.802]  You read the list from the SPP meetings.
[01:08:55.862 --> 01:08:57.463]  I mean, there's thousands of people at them.
[01:08:57.563 --> 01:09:00.844]  Thousands of different heads of every agency you can imagine.
[01:09:00.884 --> 01:09:01.825]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:09:02.435 --> 01:09:05.676]  They even have joint sessions of Congress secretly.
[01:09:05.696 --> 01:09:06.356]  They'll be admitted.
[01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:09.897]  Well, they're having a secret session of the North American Congress.
[01:09:10.637 --> 01:09:12.258]  They were having that six years ago!
[01:09:13.778 --> 01:09:14.838]  Well, they're in Cancun.
[01:09:14.898 --> 01:09:16.039]  It's not open to the public.
[01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.099]  We ought to pull... I forgot about that.
[01:09:18.139 --> 01:09:19.640]  We ought to pull that up and post that.
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:23.461]  I mean, I just... But here it is.
[01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.222]  The website is INFRATRANS.gov.
[01:09:33.391 --> 01:09:36.693]  Or it's better to just type into Google, Infrastructure and Transportation.
[01:09:38.053 --> 01:09:40.395]  It's the Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation.
[01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:41.875]  Just type that in.
[01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:46.578]  And then after that on Google, type NAFTA Trade Corridors.
[01:09:47.658 --> 01:09:49.419]  And then it's called NAFTA Superhighway!
[01:09:49.679 --> 01:09:51.380]  Hey, but that baby doesn't exist!
[01:09:53.081 --> 01:09:53.942]  Official map!
[01:09:57.844 --> 01:09:58.684]  Oh my goodness.
[01:09:59.324 --> 01:10:00.485]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:09.708]  We got billboards everywhere saying Trans-Texas Corridor and CNN says Ron Paul's Illusional and claims there's a Trans-Texas Corridor in Texas.
[01:10:10.689 --> 01:10:11.909]  The billboards are everywhere!
[01:10:11.929 --> 01:10:15.450]  In fact, I meant to Google that during the break.
[01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:16.650]  I forget the exact name of it.
[01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:22.012]  I know it says Trans-Corridor... I wonder if it's .gov, .txt.
[01:10:24.013 --> 01:10:28.034]  It's got a big website up there that says Trans-Texas Corridor on it.
[01:10:29.974 --> 01:10:30.894]  Let me just type it in.
[01:10:31.214 --> 01:10:36.696]  Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:10:37.296 --> 01:10:37.837]  Okay.
[01:10:39.957 --> 01:10:51.421]  And you type that in, and keeping Texas moving, in your area, Trans-Texas Corridor, new toll roads, congestion relief, safer roads, see how great it is.
[01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:55.942]  Oh, there's a news article today about how they're going to put transponders in all evacuees' vehicles.
[01:10:56.482 --> 01:10:57.743]  Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:10:59.474 --> 01:11:01.275]  Here's Wikipedia saying it's real.
[01:11:02.616 --> 01:11:05.658]  Oh, it's ttc.keeptexasmoving.org.
[01:11:05.719 --> 01:11:06.379]  There we go.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.080]  Imaginary!
[01:11:08.881 --> 01:11:11.983]  Huge maps everywhere, saying it's part of the Napa Superhighway.
[01:11:13.184 --> 01:11:15.806]  Says how they're taking all the private property right there on their site.
[01:11:17.547 --> 01:11:18.007]  Oh, here it is.
[01:11:18.067 --> 01:11:19.288]  Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:22.551]  .blogspot.com.
[01:11:25.558 --> 01:11:32.081]  It's just, um, I can't believe I'm here like an idiot going, it's real, it's real, we're not crazy, we're not, there's billboards everywhere!
[01:11:35.142 --> 01:11:53.989]  Ooh, I know I just keep repeating this over and over again, we got Corsi coming up next hour to talk about it with his angle on it, but I mean, I'm actually getting a headache now when I think about this, because watching everybody get conned, watching the public get snookered and suckered and scammed and bamboozled and taken for a ride, fleeced,
[01:11:55.931 --> 01:11:56.431]  Cheered.
[01:11:58.172 --> 01:11:58.833]  Scammed.
[01:11:59.073 --> 01:11:59.633]  Robbed.
[01:12:00.634 --> 01:12:01.474]  Shanghai'd.
[01:12:02.655 --> 01:12:03.416]  Bushwhacked.
[01:12:04.296 --> 01:12:05.097]  Defrauded.
[01:12:05.637 --> 01:12:06.237]  Swindled.
[01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:08.339]  Ugh!
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.641]  I mean, at a certain point, I'm like, why do I even do this show?
[01:12:13.322 --> 01:12:25.269]  If the idiot moron yuppies out there think everything's so cute and funny and they don't need to get involved in politics or they can talk about how they like Hillary or they like Fred Thompson or Giuliani, you make me sick!
[01:12:27.003 --> 01:12:28.004]  What is it you don't understand?
[01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:34.608]  It's like when a big city police department goes corrupt and, you know, in cases in New York where they'd send two-thirds of the vice squad to prison for it.
[01:12:35.349 --> 01:12:36.330]  You know, clean the city up.
[01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:38.151]  And then it gets corrupt again in a few years.
[01:12:38.691 --> 01:12:40.593]  The whole government's gone that way.
[01:12:40.953 --> 01:12:46.317]  That doesn't mean you rubber-stamping something at some bureaucracy or you going out and inspecting water lines.
[01:12:46.337 --> 01:12:47.197]  I'm not saying you.
[01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:53.602]  I mean the higher-ups, folks, are just literally swaggering around totally in the
[01:12:55.203 --> 01:12:57.084]  Bought and paid for by foreign interest.
[01:12:57.364 --> 01:13:00.105]  They're openly talking about how they want martial law in America.
[01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.807]  They killed a bunch of people on 9-11, absolute fact.
[01:13:08.228 --> 01:13:09.428]  And it's just getting worse!
[01:13:12.209 --> 01:13:13.309]  It's getting worse and worse.
[01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:17.191]  Okay, I guess Thomas in Tennessee is up next.
[01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:18.091]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[01:13:20.888 --> 01:13:21.769]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:13:21.869 --> 01:13:22.509]  Good.
[01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:26.832]  Listen, most of the population is intent on staying on the forum.
[01:13:26.852 --> 01:13:36.718]  Just the other night in the debates, I don't know if anybody commented on it or even talked about it, but Huckabee just took away one of Ron Paul's platforms, just went with it and got big applause.
[01:13:37.118 --> 01:13:38.279]  I'm going to take away the IRS.
[01:13:38.919 --> 01:13:40.220]  I've never heard him say that before.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:48.685]  You know, the silence is deafening because no one's talking about the rise in the polls and he's dominating everywhere.
[01:13:49.139 --> 01:13:53.843]  And then they're just going to take away his platforms and repeat what he says and get applause.
[01:13:53.903 --> 01:13:54.803]  It's ridiculous.
[01:13:55.804 --> 01:13:59.987]  And Sam Coleman... Well, by the way, Huckabee is for tuition for illegal aliens.
[01:14:00.387 --> 01:14:03.930]  I know, I know, but they're not going to... It doesn't matter.
[01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:05.391]  He's a good little toady pot.
[01:14:05.871 --> 01:14:11.416]  They're afraid that conservatives are going to wake up the polls, so they're just calling him the little starling now.
[01:14:12.556 --> 01:14:14.258]  They're just intent on staying uninformed.
[01:14:14.278 --> 01:14:16.139]  You know, 35 years ago, 40 years ago, Anthony Hilder
[01:14:18.024 --> 01:14:23.487]  With Millennium 2000, we put out a set of record albums about the Illuminati 40 years ago.
[01:14:23.507 --> 01:14:26.628]  I mean, I was just born then.
[01:14:27.409 --> 01:14:36.273]  Sam Cohen, the father of the neutron bomb, said that it was impossible for that Ryder truck to bring down that building in Oklahoma City.
[01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:39.475]  The father of the neutron bomb!
[01:14:39.855 --> 01:14:42.296]  People are just intent on staying uninformed.
[01:14:42.636 --> 01:14:43.737]  They don't love their children.
[01:14:43.997 --> 01:14:47.479]  When I hug and kiss my children at bed every night, I thank the Lord that I have.
[01:14:48.126 --> 01:14:49.467]  These children that he's given me.
[01:14:49.507 --> 01:14:54.450]  If we do not stand up and take our country back and put Ron Paul in there, it's over.
[01:14:54.931 --> 01:15:09.501]  And people are just... they just need to wake up and realize that Ron Paul is dominating and the press is just... Well, imagine CNN and Fox and National Talk Show hosts and questions during the debates
[01:15:10.649 --> 01:15:15.032]  Are saying it doesn't exist, and Ron Paul, they're saying he's mentally ill.
[01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:19.935]  They're saying... As soon as he said... I mean, they got billboards up and TV ads!
[01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:31.002]  As soon as he said NAFTA Superhighway, if there was an informed public out there, they would have Googled NAFTA Superhighway and seen at least 500 hits immediately, right in front of their eyeballs.
[01:15:31.423 --> 01:15:37.807]  But they just are intent on living on Fox News soundbites and just sitting there like dumbed-down sheep,
[01:15:38.648 --> 01:15:39.629]  And not doing anything about it.
[01:15:39.749 --> 01:15:41.210]  It's their fault if they do that.
[01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:42.111]  Their fault.
[01:15:43.111 --> 01:15:46.714]  Personally, they're really held responsible if they do not do their own research.
[01:15:46.734 --> 01:15:53.638]  The thing is, is that if they can't even admit... I mean, there's 25 million, 26 million people in Texas.
[01:15:53.898 --> 01:16:01.043]  There's hundreds of billboards up just on the 35 Corridor saying Trans-Texas Corridor, TV ads, how great it is.
[01:16:01.835 --> 01:16:09.123]  And I guarantee you a bunch of Texans watched television and thought Ron Paul was a kook even though they see the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:16:09.143 --> 01:16:11.585]  Right now in state.
[01:16:12.206 --> 01:16:13.207]  I mean, that's what I mean.
[01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:17.671]  And imagine if they can't believe that when it's in their face.
[01:16:18.933 --> 01:16:22.897]  Or when you type Napa Superhighway in and it's on the federal websites.
[01:16:23.783 --> 01:16:26.844]  Then can you imagine me telling them they're putting cancer viruses in their vaccines?
[01:16:26.864 --> 01:16:31.165]  Can you imagine me telling them that they're carrying out eugenics against all of us?
[01:16:31.585 --> 01:16:33.526]  They don't even know what eugenics means, brother.
[01:16:34.046 --> 01:16:38.307]  They literally... I know, it's just... Hey, listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:42.928]  Let's talk to Mark in Boston.
[01:16:42.968 --> 01:16:43.668]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:16:43.688 --> 01:16:44.088]  Go ahead.
[01:16:44.108 --> 01:16:45.449]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:45.509 --> 01:16:46.409]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:55.427]  I'm calling to announce that the Boston Tea Party and Conference for 9-11 Truth will be happening December 15th and 16th.
[01:16:55.968 --> 01:17:00.571]  We've got an advertisement up on Infowars.net that I personally paid for out of my own pocket.
[01:17:01.912 --> 01:17:12.961]  I'm actually the... not to toot my own horn or anything, but I was the guy that was assaulted by the Fox News reporter, and you guys graciously put that up on Prison Planet, I believe.
[01:17:14.402 --> 01:17:16.524]  But I would just like to hope that
[01:17:17.813 --> 01:17:27.477]  Things like what We Are Change is doing and what you are doing would influence people to get out there and be active and hand out flyers, hand out your DVDs.
[01:17:28.438 --> 01:17:29.358]  Just get involved.
[01:17:29.438 --> 01:17:30.438]  Come to our conference.
[01:17:30.879 --> 01:17:32.119]  Donate money to Ron Paul.
[01:17:32.979 --> 01:17:37.261]  Tell folks about when and where your conference is.
[01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:40.642]  It's Saturday, December 15th at Fennell Hall.
[01:17:41.383 --> 01:17:46.425]  We're having Joel Hirschhorn, former staff member, Congressional Office of
[01:17:47.168 --> 01:17:48.449]  Technology assessment?
[01:17:48.489 --> 01:17:49.690]  I'm just reading it from a flyer.
[01:17:50.511 --> 01:18:05.684]  Stephen Jones, former physics professor, Richard Gage, Kevin Ryan, we're having Bob Bowman, Kevin Barrett, Barbara Hunniger, I think we're even having some victims, family members.
[01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:08.206]  Sounds like a powerful lineup to me.
[01:18:08.286 --> 01:18:10.468]  Bunch of engineers and physicists in that lineup.
[01:18:11.028 --> 01:18:11.949]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:14.391]  Yes, it's very exciting.
[01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:18.972]  I really hope we'll be able to cover the cost of renting the venue.
[01:18:19.252 --> 01:18:27.036]  I mean, what are they going to do when one of the most respected Italian presidents ever, and the former head of their intelligence agency, says our government carried out 9-11?
[01:18:27.556 --> 01:18:28.157]  That's shocking.
[01:18:28.197 --> 01:18:28.917]  I'm glad he did it.
[01:18:30.118 --> 01:18:31.158]  I'm so happy.
[01:18:31.658 --> 01:18:34.700]  Well, wait till you see who we've got tomorrow, brother.
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.801]  A little surprise guest for everybody.
[01:18:36.821 --> 01:18:38.402]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:18:38.442 --> 01:18:39.422]  You keep it up, my friend.
[01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:41.123]  And thank you for all you do out there.
[01:18:41.977 --> 01:18:45.499]  And it's not gracious of us to post a video of Fox News assaulting you.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.922]  It's gracious of you to put your way in the... to put yourself in the way of their fist.
[01:18:54.105 --> 01:18:55.506]  It is a big idea.
[01:18:55.526 --> 01:18:57.647]  A new world order.
[01:18:58.368 --> 01:19:02.911]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of government.
[01:19:03.251 --> 01:19:05.012]  It's known as the Builderbergs.
[01:19:05.312 --> 01:19:08.314]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:11.256]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:19:12.017 --> 01:19:19.342]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:19:22.381 --> 01:19:27.384]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:19:27.845 --> 01:19:31.327]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:19:31.707 --> 01:19:34.229]  Bill Burr is making great progress for the world government.
[01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:35.430]  Most people have no idea.
[01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:36.170]  They're not after money.
[01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:37.291]  They have all the money they need.
[01:19:37.491 --> 01:19:38.292]  They're after power.
[01:19:38.472 --> 01:19:39.492]  That's what they're after.
[01:19:39.633 --> 01:19:44.176]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:19:44.376 --> 01:19:47.818]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:47.938 --> 01:19:50.940]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.181]  You have been warned.
[01:19:52.975 --> 01:19:57.480]  Go to RonPaulStuff.com today and show your support for Ron Paul.
[01:19:57.721 --> 01:20:01.765]  Get the latest and greatest Ron Paul promotional gear to help spread the message.
[01:20:02.045 --> 01:20:10.375]  RonPaulStuff.com carries over nine different hard-hitting 100% cotton t-shirts and four different designs of Ron Paul sweatshirts to help keep you warm
[01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:10.735]  I think so.
[01:20:32.722 --> 01:20:33.322]  We're good to go.
[01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:56.433]  Spyville.com is your choice for everything spy related.
[01:20:56.673 --> 01:21:04.622]  Stealth cameras cleverly disguised as items commonly found around the home, night vision cameras, covert phone and voice recorders, powerful binoculars, security systems and more.
[01:21:04.842 --> 01:21:10.688]  Find hidden cameras wherever you go with a small handheld spy finder and locate hidden transmitters with one of our bug detectors.
[01:21:11.048 --> 01:21:11.768]  We're good to go.
[01:21:31.493 --> 01:21:32.274]  We're good to go.
[01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:53.435]  I think so.
[01:22:11.641 --> 01:22:15.204]  Experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[01:22:15.524 --> 01:22:21.528]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[01:22:21.748 --> 01:22:25.291]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[01:22:25.551 --> 01:22:30.095]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[01:22:30.375 --> 01:22:31.135]  Do your part.
[01:22:31.416 --> 01:22:33.677]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[01:22:34.038 --> 01:22:40.142]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink

[01:22:59.981 --> 01:23:02.562]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:23:02.622 --> 01:23:05.423]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:23:05.463 --> 01:23:07.964]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:23:08.064 --> 01:23:11.705]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lip to Big John.
[01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:12.165]  Big John.
[01:23:12.205 --> 01:23:12.825]  Big John.
[01:23:13.426 --> 01:23:14.106]  Big John.
[01:23:14.146 --> 01:23:14.406]  Big John.
[01:23:24.275 --> 01:23:25.155]  We're good to go.
[01:23:48.599 --> 01:23:54.705]  It is really smart to give the J. Michael Stevens Group a call and at least get a free catalog.
[01:23:55.205 --> 01:23:57.687]  Or they've got a two-month supply for one individual.
[01:23:57.747 --> 01:23:58.928]  It's very inexpensive.
[01:23:59.349 --> 01:24:02.191]  It at least gives you that backup and lasts more than 10 years.
[01:24:02.211 --> 01:24:03.312]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:06.115]  There's big banners to efoodsdirect.com, the top of infowars.com, and of course
[01:24:15.905 --> 01:24:17.206]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:17.226 --> 01:24:20.448]  That website, again, if you missed it, eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:24:21.048 --> 01:24:22.970]  Another fine company we have is Interfood.

[01:24:36.459 --> 01:24:37.720]  It's one of their newest products.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.601]  They're the makers, again, of Interfood.
[01:24:40.301 --> 01:24:45.886]  And it is just chock full of all of these vitamins in their natural form.
[01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:52.831]  And it's a great way to get your children to take these high quality, energized nutrients.
[01:24:52.851 --> 01:24:54.372]  And don't forget the inner food itself.
[01:24:54.392 --> 01:24:55.252]  ENERFOOD.COM or 1-866-762-9238.
[01:24:55.273 --> 01:24:56.173]  1-866-762-9238 or ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:24:56.654 --> 01:24:59.936]  And it really boosts your immune system and a lot more during the holidays.
[01:25:10.007 --> 01:25:10.948]  When it's so important.
[01:25:11.728 --> 01:25:13.489]  Okay, who is up next here?
[01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:16.691]  Jay in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:25:16.731 --> 01:25:17.352]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:18.813 --> 01:25:19.053]  Alex.
[01:25:19.653 --> 01:25:19.933]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:21.434 --> 01:25:22.395]  Hey, this is Jay.
[01:25:22.515 --> 01:25:24.456]  I wrote that Rockefeller's article for you.
[01:25:25.337 --> 01:25:25.957]  Well, good job.
[01:25:25.977 --> 01:25:26.618]  What's on your mind?
[01:25:27.398 --> 01:25:28.559]  I've got good news.
[01:25:28.599 --> 01:25:33.322]  We had an in-game and loose change movie night last Friday.
[01:25:33.342 --> 01:25:34.923]  We had a lot of skeptics show up.
[01:25:36.184 --> 01:25:40.985]  Hey, millions of people out there doing similar things to what you're doing is hundreds of millions, and so just keep it up.
[01:26:00.843 --> 01:26:06.746]  Also, when you posted the article, we got inspired, my friends and I, to start an anti-New World Order website.
[01:26:06.806 --> 01:26:09.168]  So, should we promote that?
[01:26:09.228 --> 01:26:09.748]  Is that okay?
[01:26:09.788 --> 01:26:10.448]  Of course you can!
[01:26:10.468 --> 01:26:11.009]  Just go ahead.
[01:26:11.909 --> 01:26:14.150]  It's Nicentruth.com.
[01:26:14.871 --> 01:26:17.532]  N-I-C-E-N-T-R-U-T-H.com.
[01:26:18.953 --> 01:26:23.495]  And I'd imagine you talk about imaginary NAFTA highways and stuff that are on all the government websites?
[01:26:24.218 --> 01:26:27.821]  Well, we've just launched it, so we've only been on there a couple weeks.
[01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:28.521]  We've got everything.
[01:26:29.062 --> 01:26:30.783]  We've been talking a lot about the drones lately.
[01:26:31.504 --> 01:26:32.384]  They're just everywhere.
[01:26:32.484 --> 01:26:39.349]  By the way, you posted some articles about Houston, and there was one about it happened in Lexington, Kentucky.
[01:26:39.389 --> 01:26:40.390]  There were drones everywhere.
[01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:42.592]  And they're here in Tennessee, too.
[01:26:42.652 --> 01:26:43.653]  They're all around Nashville.
[01:26:44.413 --> 01:26:45.534]  Well, we're the cattle.
[01:26:45.554 --> 01:26:46.355]  They're only out at night.
[01:26:47.015 --> 01:26:49.377]  We're the cattle, and this is the rogue government.
[01:26:50.126 --> 01:26:56.410]  With systems that many of the helicopters have that look right through your walls, just letting us know that they absolutely rule us.
[01:26:56.430 --> 01:27:00.132]  They've hired 26,000 preachers and trained them.
[01:27:00.172 --> 01:27:02.613]  Now publicly, we told you this a year before, it even broke.
[01:27:02.933 --> 01:27:03.994]  I'm proud of the fact of that.
[01:27:04.594 --> 01:27:09.857]  We had the pastor on who, when we talked to another pastor and we got the classified documents,
[01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:11.469]  You're right about that.
[01:27:11.489 --> 01:27:14.450]  We get into a lot of the religious issues, especially the coming One World Religion.
[01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:43.445]  And all that FEMA programs for pastors is all part of that.
[01:27:44.645 --> 01:27:58.713]  Well, yeah, because once they set up the World Council of Churches with the Rockefellers, then they were able to get all of the different denominations for big donations from the World Council of Churches into that, and then they set the doctrine from there.
[01:27:59.534 --> 01:27:59.874]  Exactly.
[01:28:02.142 --> 01:28:18.498]  Well, I mean, that's how we have the same zoning laws from Austin, Texas, to New York, New York, is that it's all internationally written up by the UN, and then it's adopted by treaty, and then the big bond houses and insurance companies put it in their requirements for the cities to be rated or insured, and they all just adopt it.
[01:28:18.518 --> 01:28:24.143]  I mean, that's how this whole globalist system is being set up right now.
[01:28:25.365 --> 01:28:26.146]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:26.486 --> 01:28:28.928]  Alright, the book is Day of Reckoning.
[01:28:29.148 --> 01:28:33.831]  Hubris, ideology, and the greed are tearing America apart.
[01:28:33.871 --> 01:28:36.313]  How that's happening by Patrick J. Buchanan.
[01:28:36.813 --> 01:28:39.315]  He is scheduled to join us in the next segment.
[01:28:39.335 --> 01:28:40.075]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.198 --> 01:28:45.119]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.139 --> 01:28:47.200]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:50.823]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:57.413]  Yes, there is an in-dash AM FM shortwave radio.
[01:28:57.693 --> 01:29:05.779]  For limited time and in limited numbers, the Sony GT-160S AM FM shortwave radio and CD player is available only at the Power Hour.
[01:29:06.059 --> 01:29:14.145]  This radio is designed to eliminate interference from ignition systems, and the result is clear, clean reception, so you can hear your favorite broadcasts both domestically and internationally.

[01:29:21.551 --> 01:29:24.873]  That's 877-817-9829 to order.
[01:29:25.233 --> 01:29:28.976]  Only $249 plus shipping and handling, and we'll ship it right to you.
[01:29:29.276 --> 01:29:31.517]  There's even an input to plug in an external source.
[01:29:31.737 --> 01:29:37.661]  Your MP3 player, your iPod, your DVD player, or any other source will sound great through your new Sony receiver.
[01:29:37.981 --> 01:29:40.924]  These radios are not available anywhere else and for a limited time.
[01:29:41.144 --> 01:29:41.825]  So call now.
[01:29:42.045 --> 01:29:42.285]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:29:42.305 --> 01:29:45.768]  That's 877-817-9829 and get your Sony GT-160S AM FM shortwave radio and CD player from the Power Hour.
[01:29:53.935 --> 01:29:55.776]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:29:55.996 --> 01:29:59.037]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:29:59.278 --> 01:30:03.900]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:06.881]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:12.003]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:30:12.224 --> 01:30:14.004]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:30:14.204 --> 01:30:19.927]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:30:20.187 --> 01:30:21.888]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:30:24.657 --> 01:30:24.917]  That's 888!
[01:30:24.957 --> 01:30:25.378]  Use SFR1 today!
[01:30:53.504 --> 01:30:56.446]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:30:56.607 --> 01:31:01.831]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:31:02.131 --> 01:31:07.475]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:07.856 --> 01:31:08.976]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:09.337 --> 01:31:18.364]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:31:18.644 --> 01:31:20.246]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:31:20.486 --> 01:31:24.651]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:31:24.692 --> 01:31:29.317]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:31:29.718 --> 01:31:31.380]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:31:33.542 --> 01:31:34.303]  Keep it natural.
[01:31:34.623 --> 01:31:42.788]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:31:43.028 --> 01:31:47.191]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:48.271]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:32:02.883 --> 01:32:09.689]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:33.697 --> 01:32:36.360]  Well, we interview him just about every year.
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:37.882]  One of his new books comes out.
[01:32:37.902 --> 01:32:39.063]  They've all been bestsellers.
[01:32:39.463 --> 01:32:52.417]  Death of the West, years ago, was really one of the first big books to explain how we're going into a new world order, a North American Union, how the West is imploding, what illegal immigration is really all about, sacrificing
[01:32:53.487 --> 01:33:04.514]  The United States, Canada, Europe, on the altar of globalism, and his new book is Day of Reckoning, How Hubris, Ideology, and Greed Are Tearing America Apart.
[01:33:04.854 --> 01:33:10.798]  Now, I tried to go over all of Pat Buchanan's bio, Nixon's speechwriter, and
[01:33:11.478 --> 01:33:12.079]  We're good to go.
[01:33:29.538 --> 01:33:30.439]  By conservatives.
[01:33:30.559 --> 01:33:45.913]  I would also dovetail that Dr. Corsi's book, of course, Late Great USA, is a best-seller that dovetails nicely with my new film that just came out, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, where we show the world leaders saying they're setting up at NAU, setting up and merging it with the European Union.
[01:33:45.973 --> 01:33:52.519]  Bush, with Merkel and Barroso of Europe, just a few months ago, saying it on C-SPAN.
[01:33:53.961 --> 01:34:05.291]  They say one thing out of one side of their mouth and another thing out of the other side of their mouth, and that's why we're really honored to have Pat Buchanan on, because if people won't listen to me or Dr. Corsi and others, maybe they'll listen to Pat Buchanan.
[01:34:05.692 --> 01:34:06.873]  Mr. Buchanan, thanks for coming on.
[01:34:07.333 --> 01:34:07.974]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:34:07.994 --> 01:34:08.535]  Appreciate it.
[01:34:09.335 --> 01:34:18.284]  Let's first just run down the new book, because there's a lot of topics you cover, and this integrates in with the whole New World Order system, but Day of Reckoning, break it down for us.
[01:34:19.184 --> 01:34:24.528]  Well, there's a number of crises coming up the road at the United States, and it looks to me like a perfect storm.
[01:34:25.289 --> 01:34:31.494]  You can start off with the dollar that's sinking very, very rapidly, the de-industrialization of America.
[01:34:31.554 --> 01:34:35.798]  We lost one in six manufacturing jobs, three million of them in the last seven years.
[01:34:36.478 --> 01:34:39.861]  We've had five trillion in trade deficits since NAFTA.
[01:34:40.502 --> 01:34:42.503]  You've got a $233 billion trade deficit with China.
[01:34:45.297 --> 01:34:51.420]  You've got a wide open border where six million people apparently came across in the last seven years.
[01:34:51.981 --> 01:34:55.163]  That's about 800,000 invaders every year.
[01:34:55.183 --> 01:34:59.905]  You've got no plan to secure that border on the part of the administration or either party.
[01:34:59.945 --> 01:35:00.645]  A lot of talk.
[01:35:01.286 --> 01:35:04.027]  You've got America tied down in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[01:35:04.508 --> 01:35:08.870]  General Powell says the army is breaking, and yet we're committed to defend countries
[01:35:09.642 --> 01:35:21.492]  All over the world, from the Baltic Republics, to Eastern Europe, to the Balkans, to Israel, to the Middle East, to the Persian Gulf, to Taiwan, to South Korea, to Japan.
[01:35:22.452 --> 01:35:31.740]  And you put all these together with a Social Security and Medicare fiscal crisis, and you put on the fact that the United States, the melting pot, is cracked and broken.
[01:35:32.586 --> 01:35:36.987]  And we are not Americanizing or assimilating immigrants the way we used to.
[01:35:37.007 --> 01:35:39.807]  We're encouraging them to maintain a separate language.
[01:35:40.467 --> 01:35:43.028]  Spanish is becoming the second language in America.
[01:35:43.728 --> 01:35:51.669]  I see the decomposition and the deconstruction of America and the eventual merger of the United States with Mexico.
[01:35:51.689 --> 01:35:57.410]  And if we don't get the border fence built within the next 10 years, we will never get it built.
[01:35:57.610 --> 01:36:01.031]  And I think there will be a de facto merger of this country with Mexico.
[01:36:01.946 --> 01:36:09.273]  And that, to me, is the end of the sovereign, independent, unique, different United States of America.
[01:36:10.714 --> 01:36:25.888]  Well, that's what the facts show, but then the mainstream controlled press, unless you or a few other people are on there, and you're maybe 1-2% of the news coverage out there, they say it doesn't exist, Ron Paul's delusional, there's no trans-Texas corridor,
[01:36:26.708 --> 01:36:28.189]  CNN said that last week.
[01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:30.851]  There's no SPP plan to merge.
[01:36:30.871 --> 01:36:35.274]  But then Vicente Fox goes on Larry King Live and says, oh yeah, we are merging the countries.
[01:36:35.694 --> 01:36:40.257]  And the official Canadian Parliament has declarations talking about it.
[01:36:40.457 --> 01:36:44.400]  There's hundreds of government websites saying that they're, quote, integrating the nations.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:47.702]  Robert Pasture at the CFR is saying it.
[01:36:48.103 --> 01:36:52.125]  I mean, how can the establishment continue to have this implementation by stealth?
[01:36:52.425 --> 01:36:53.746]  And do you think they're overreaching?
[01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:56.288]  Do you think that their intense lies
[01:36:58.008 --> 01:37:02.529]  Here's what's happening, Alex, and clearly we're moving dramatically and openly toward this.
[01:37:02.549 --> 01:37:03.869]  I mean, take the Wall Street Journal.
[01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:11.411]  You can Google the name Robert Bartley, conservative, neoconservative editorial editor of the Wall Street Journal for 30 years.
[01:37:12.511 --> 01:37:16.272]  Put his name in and put five words, there shall be open borders.
[01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:21.993]  For 25 years, the Wall Street Journal editorial page, the neoconservative voice of the nation,
[01:37:22.808 --> 01:37:27.753]  Has been fighting to erase the borders between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
[01:37:28.333 --> 01:37:32.277]  As you mentioned, Vicente Fox does not disguise what he is all about.
[01:37:32.297 --> 01:37:44.049]  I put in an earlier book of mine, State of Emergency, I've got his direct quotes where he goes over to Europe and says, the EU is our model, this is what we want done, the erasure of borders, people and goods.
[01:37:45.099 --> 01:37:48.100]  And tourists, everybody travels back and forth at will.
[01:37:48.961 --> 01:37:49.781]  This is going on.
[01:37:49.821 --> 01:38:03.147]  What is happening is, the project was advancing forward until the populist reaction, the same one that defeated the amnesty bill, rose up to the point where they said, oh, this is just silly, this is paranoid.
[01:38:03.567 --> 01:38:13.051]  But the truth is, once you integrate two economies, the ways ours are being integrated with NAFTA, and the post-NAFTA declaration is down there at Baylor University,
[01:38:13.698 --> 01:38:19.304]  Inexorably, out of these merger, economic merger, rises a political entity.
[01:38:19.444 --> 01:38:23.448]  Above it, maintain first and foremost the rules and regulations.
[01:38:23.988 --> 01:38:29.874]  And this is how the common market, the six-nation common market of 19, or European Coal and Steel Community of 1953,
[01:38:31.716 --> 01:38:48.748]  How it evolved into this giant transnational government, the European Union, and only now are you seeing French and Dutch rejecting the new European Constitution, rising up, as Americans are rising up, to say, thus far and no further, we're going to roll this back.
[01:38:49.248 --> 01:38:53.311]  We're not going to let these transnational governments rule our country.
[01:38:53.711 --> 01:38:57.914]  The most important thing we have is our nation, and that is independent.
[01:38:58.607 --> 01:39:00.470]  And that is unique, and it is different.
[01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:04.535]  And we don't want a shotgun marriage between the United States and Mexico.
[01:39:04.555 --> 01:39:11.865]  Now, you're an expert political strategist, so I can pose this question to you, Pat.
[01:39:13.616 --> 01:39:17.718]  We see a major realignment happening, whether Ron Paul wins or not.
[01:39:18.078 --> 01:39:23.441]  Regardless, we're seeing new forms of political activism on the web, raising record amounts of money.
[01:39:23.501 --> 01:39:29.405]  We're seeing the left even starting to wake up and join with libertarians, paleo-conservatives.
[01:39:30.125 --> 01:39:32.866]  We're seeing Congress with an all-time low approval rating of 11%.
[01:39:33.006 --> 01:39:34.027]  The President with a 23%.
[01:39:36.445 --> 01:39:36.825]  I don't know.
[01:39:59.455 --> 01:40:08.058]  And in the future, what collision do you see between swelling populism and nationalism from Europe to the United States to Australia?
[01:40:08.318 --> 01:40:09.478]  How are they going to collide?
[01:40:10.259 --> 01:40:27.044]  Well, I think they collided this year in the Senate bill where Senator Kennedy and President Bush and John McCain and Harry Reid and the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal and La Raza and the Chamber of Commerce
[01:40:27.908 --> 01:40:32.829]  All colluded for a amnesty for the 12 to 20 million illegal aliens here.
[01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:44.672]  And not only that, buried in it was a amnesty, a complete exemption from all civil and criminal penalties of businesses who have hired, employed, knowingly illegal aliens.
[01:40:45.133 --> 01:40:53.975]  So the whole idea was to basically legitimize the invasion that's taken place and to exonerate the businesses and the others
[01:40:54.645 --> 01:41:01.270]  Who have hired these individuals, and basically to give a benediction to the folks that let them in and refused to enforce the laws.
[01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:10.517]  That tremendous uprising in the nation, among the American people, for the first time almost in my lifetime, overthrew the establishment of both parties.
[01:41:10.978 --> 01:41:23.287]  I fought against GATT, I fought against NAFTA, I fought against the WTO, and we had great coalitions, and we went up to the hill, but we were driven off the hill by the establishment uniting and buying the votes of the congressmen.
[01:41:23.883 --> 01:41:27.904]  This time, the force was so powerful, they were body-slammed.
[01:41:28.244 --> 01:41:33.005]  However, then the great coalition we formed together goes back home.
[01:41:33.645 --> 01:41:40.087]  The battle is over, the war is won, but the other side is coming back again, working night and day and night and day.
[01:41:40.687 --> 01:41:45.548]  Now, on this project, on the project of the Erasure of Borders and the Rest,
[01:41:46.326 --> 01:41:48.688]  They have gone, a lot of them have gone underground.
[01:41:48.788 --> 01:41:54.011]  But it is undeniable that the transnational corporations want to get rid of borders everywhere.
[01:41:54.531 --> 01:41:59.415]  They want the ability to move their trucks in and out with their goods in and out of the United States.
[01:41:59.455 --> 01:42:01.336]  And they also want to remove
[01:42:02.156 --> 01:42:10.721]  The old political systems, like when they set up a World Trade Organization in 1995 by private interest, it now supersedes the Congress because they hand over their authority.
[01:42:10.741 --> 01:42:15.203]  So it's more than just the cheap goods flooding into control markets.
[01:42:15.544 --> 01:42:17.225]  It's about a New World Order, isn't it?
[01:42:17.625 --> 01:42:25.349]  It really is, but I think, see, we've been guarding against the New World Order coming through the UN and something like that, but Russia and China are not going to
[01:42:26.299 --> 01:42:38.121]  Submit to the UN that everybody knows it is a corrupt institution, a bunch of third world thugs, and people stealing money, and all the rest of it.
[01:42:38.562 --> 01:42:44.203]  But the real power coming is the corporations have enormous power.
[01:42:44.703 --> 01:42:53.725]  Alex, of the top 100 entities in the country in terms of control of money and resources, half are corporations now, and half are countries.
[01:42:54.165 --> 01:42:55.825]  These transnational corporations
[01:42:56.374 --> 01:42:58.876]  Their objective is to erase all these borders.
[01:42:58.916 --> 01:43:01.619]  They work with legislatures incrementally.
[01:43:01.999 --> 01:43:08.005]  Now, what's happening in the U.S., as I say, is they've gone underground, so to speak, as in, oh, this is silly in the United States.
[01:43:08.385 --> 01:43:09.666]  You folks are paranoid.
[01:43:09.746 --> 01:43:11.648]  Yeah, they've gone to stealth mode.
[01:43:11.688 --> 01:43:13.370]  They've kind of submerged like a sub.
[01:43:13.610 --> 01:43:19.175]  So what I'm asking you is, how do you see it playing out with your political acumen and gravitas?
[01:43:19.575 --> 01:43:21.377]  I mean, give us two or three scenarios.
[01:43:21.397 --> 01:43:22.278]  How do you see it playing out?
[01:43:24.878 --> 01:43:36.850]  I think Ron Paul's nomination run is outstanding in terms of awakening the establishment in Washington to a sentiment out there that people want their country back.
[01:43:37.190 --> 01:43:38.672]  They want to get out of this new world order.
[01:43:38.692 --> 01:43:39.873]  They want to get the troops home.
[01:43:40.153 --> 01:43:41.475]  They want the borders secured.
[01:43:41.495 --> 01:43:43.056]  They want to stop exporting jobs.
[01:43:43.337 --> 01:43:45.459]  They want people to look out for America first.
[01:43:45.979 --> 01:43:49.122]  It's the same issue that we used in 92, 96, and 2000.
[01:43:49.482 --> 01:43:52.424]  That phrase Ron Paul is using.
[01:43:52.464 --> 01:44:10.978]  My concern is that the establishment, because it is working night and day, and it's minions down here in Washington, and the K Street crowd and the rest of them, who are working for these corporations, who are working for deeper integration of the United States and Europe and Japan and all the rest,
[01:44:11.673 --> 01:44:28.516]  That they are still enormously powerful, and it's hard to see how we've got a political leader who's going to win the presidency who is, A, aware of this, B, deeply concerned about it, and C, committed to blocking it at all costs and restoring and maintaining our national sovereignty.
[01:44:28.656 --> 01:44:32.737]  Pat, what tips would you give Ron Paul in his run for president?
[01:44:33.317 --> 01:44:34.937]  I think Ron Paul's doing a great job.
[01:44:34.977 --> 01:44:36.497]  He doesn't need my counsel right now.
[01:44:36.577 --> 01:44:39.638]  I would say he's probably better off focusing on New Hampshire.
[01:44:40.561 --> 01:44:45.423]  Than Iowa, because the Iowa thing is pretty much based on organization.
[01:44:45.443 --> 01:44:56.986]  I think he's going to do fine in Iowa, but I think he's got a real chance to do very well in New Hampshire, because I think a number of people will probably be eliminated in Iowa, and Ron Paul won't.
[01:44:57.026 --> 01:44:58.767]  He's got the resources now to go.
[01:44:59.067 --> 01:45:00.167]  One piece of advice I'd give him?
[01:45:01.008 --> 01:45:02.168]  Stay in this thing.
[01:45:02.948 --> 01:45:04.309]  Stay in this thing.
[01:45:04.909 --> 01:45:08.210]  Do not let them run you out if you lose Iowa and lose New Hampshire.
[01:45:08.846 --> 01:45:13.167]  You keep taking that message to the country, and you keep demanding debates.
[01:45:13.227 --> 01:45:14.828]  My guess is you'll be cut out of the debates.
[01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:18.829]  Not cut out, but they won't hold debates once you break out of New Hampshire.
[01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:22.311]  They're fairly rare, but stay in those debates with those guys.
[01:45:23.191 --> 01:45:31.974]  And keep your voice in that screen, because when they start cutting you out of the debates, then the country says, well, he's out of it, and let's look at what's left.
[01:45:33.251 --> 01:45:35.814]  So that's what I advise you to do, but he's run a fine campaign.
[01:45:51.008 --> 01:45:55.212]  His PDD 51 says he's above Congress and continuity of government.
[01:45:55.512 --> 01:45:58.234]  Then he went to Canada three months ago, and I have the declaration.
[01:45:58.274 --> 01:46:05.461]  This was public, and said the UN is over the US during massive terror attacks or biological chemical releases.
[01:46:05.521 --> 01:46:09.704]  The Houston Chronicle's reporting they've built detention centers for the American people.
[01:46:10.064 --> 01:46:12.246]  They are federalizing more and more of the police.
[01:46:12.607 --> 01:46:14.228]  This is now a reality.
[01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:16.350]  They had Tommy Franks on the payroll.
[01:46:16.690 --> 01:46:19.813]  Running around saying, after one more attack, we go to martial law.
[01:46:20.293 --> 01:46:33.403]  I reported this a year and a half ago, it just came out two months ago, that preachers have been hired, 26,000 of them, and paid, I don't know if you're aware of this, to go tell their flocks to turn their guns in if they're told and submit to inoculations.
[01:46:33.723 --> 01:46:39.028]  The police state, which Hillary or whoever comes into power can use as well.
[01:46:39.048 --> 01:46:42.951]  I mean, can you speak to the type of attack?
[01:46:43.211 --> 01:46:45.693]  Gonzales saying there's no habeas corpus for citizens.
[01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:57.613]  Well, if he said that point blank, that's a constitutional right of every American citizen, and I know Lincoln suspended it on his own volition.
[01:46:58.311 --> 01:47:01.412]  During the Civil War, but it takes the Congress of the United States to do that.
[01:47:01.452 --> 01:47:06.454]  Remember, he was in the Senate, and he said, well, yeah, you don't necessarily as a citizen have a habeas corpus, yeah.
[01:47:06.574 --> 01:47:07.334]  You do have it.
[01:47:07.514 --> 01:47:16.217]  I mean, what that's preposterous, and there is in the Constitution, the Congress can suspend it at certain times, but I don't believe this Congress is going to do that.
[01:47:16.317 --> 01:47:17.477]  Well, Pat, here's what I'm saying.
[01:47:18.018 --> 01:47:21.539]  PDD 51, I'm sure you've seen it, came out May 9th.
[01:47:22.059 --> 01:47:26.521]  I mean, the government doesn't start announcing and developing and funding these things for no reason.
[01:47:26.781 --> 01:47:27.781]  Why do you think that's being done?
[01:47:28.577 --> 01:47:42.880]  You know, you are more familiar with this, I'll be honest, than I have, than I am, but I find it extraordinarily... I don't believe a country that rose up the way we did against that amnesty is going to go gentle into that good night.
[01:47:43.380 --> 01:47:57.263]  I just don't believe that, and I don't think the government, and I know there are folks in the military and others like that who aren't going to go along with anything like that, and I really am dubious that Bush or Cheney are going to try anything like that or anybody that went in there.
[01:47:58.110 --> 01:47:59.131]  I would try that now.
[01:47:59.151 --> 01:48:14.061]  I know what Tommy Frank said, I believe, was that if there's another 9-11, you know, in effect, we might pass legislation, basically, that interferes with the civil liberties of the American people.
[01:48:14.642 --> 01:48:20.546]  And I don't doubt if you had something like several 9-11s here, you would have a very changed society.
[01:48:20.566 --> 01:48:21.827]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:48:21.887 --> 01:48:24.929]  And people might willingly give up certain freedoms.
[01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:27.391]  Sure, let's shift gears into something else right before break.
[01:48:29.119 --> 01:48:34.163]  Bush is appointing a bunch of former Clinton people to the State Department and Pentagon, as you know.
[01:48:34.643 --> 01:48:38.426]  They are giving her speech writing lessons, telling her what the talking points are.
[01:48:39.686 --> 01:48:42.208]  Fox News and others have reportedly been behind her.
[01:48:42.468 --> 01:48:44.370]  She's gotten double defense contractor money.
[01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:45.971]  Is she the heir apparent?
[01:48:48.433 --> 01:48:51.275]  Barack Obama doesn't think so.
[01:48:51.615 --> 01:48:54.237]  Look, I do think, I would have guessed as a
[01:48:54.853 --> 01:48:57.794]  Two months ago that Hillary Clinton would be the next President of the United States.
[01:48:58.495 --> 01:49:03.357]  As of about, I'd say eight months ago, I would have said it's going to be John McCain.
[01:49:04.057 --> 01:49:05.738]  Now, I don't know.
[01:49:06.418 --> 01:49:07.498]  I think there's a chance.
[01:49:07.599 --> 01:49:15.582]  I mean, it's not for sure, but the way she's reacting, the way she seems to be panicking, the way she's attacking Barack Obama for what he said in kindergarten,
[01:49:16.252 --> 01:49:19.496]  There's a sense in my mind that she's panicking a little bit over Iowa.
[01:49:19.897 --> 01:49:23.922]  Now, if she loses Iowa and wins New Hampshire, she's a Democratic nominee.
[01:49:23.962 --> 01:49:30.289]  But what I'm asking is, why have Republicans, certainly you know this, why have they been trying to position her?
[01:49:30.309 --> 01:49:33.673]  I think many of them think she'll probably be the easiest person to beat.
[01:49:34.074 --> 01:49:35.696]  That's why a lot of them are attacking her.
[01:49:36.847 --> 01:49:37.708]  Pat Buchanan, stay there.
[01:49:37.748 --> 01:49:38.429]  Final segment with you.
[01:49:38.449 --> 01:49:46.517]  I want to talk more about the book and how the illegal aliens are pulling down American flags at post offices, public schools, and how the media tries to cover this up.
[01:49:46.577 --> 01:49:52.484]  I mean, just how bad this reconquering of the Southwest is and how you think we should deal with this if you were president.
[01:49:53.837 --> 01:49:58.819]  We all know that Berkey water systems are the only trusted name in water filtration available on the market.
[01:49:58.979 --> 01:50:14.384]  The revolutionary Berkey Light self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, and radon-222.

[01:50:54.029 --> 01:50:55.710]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:56.031 --> 01:50:59.493]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:59.653 --> 01:51:01.954]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:51:02.115 --> 01:51:04.856]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:05.177 --> 01:51:10.660]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:14.903]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:51:15.223 --> 01:51:20.167]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:51:54.548 --> 01:52:00.192]  Now that we are in the midst of the presidential primaries, Republican candidate Ron Paul needs our support more than ever.
[01:52:00.592 --> 01:52:06.597]  Ron Paul stands for the issues that need to be addressed and not glossed over and forgotten like the globalist crowd being fielded.
[01:52:06.937 --> 01:52:13.282]  Unlike other candidates, Ron Paul takes a stand to follow what our forefathers envisioned America to be through the Constitution.
[01:52:13.562 --> 01:52:23.629]  Dr. Paul will restore sound money, eliminate the IRS, prevent the NAU, get us back to our constitutional roots, and guard our nation here at home by bringing home the troops.
[01:52:24.029 --> 01:52:25.890]  Show your support for Ron Paul today.
[01:52:26.150 --> 01:52:32.851]  Go to RonPaulStickers.com to find the latest Ron Paul promotional media to help promote our last hope for America.
[01:52:33.131 --> 01:52:37.753]  Yard signs, buffer stickers, window decals, buttons, car magnets, and much more.
[01:52:38.053 --> 01:52:39.293]  Support Ron Paul.
[01:52:39.533 --> 01:52:42.494]  Take the stand for the traditional values that America needs.
[01:52:42.754 --> 01:52:47.115]  Go to RonPaulStickers.com and help get the word out about Ron Paul.
[01:52:47.475 --> 01:52:48.855]  This is our chance, America.
[01:52:49.135 --> 01:52:49.696]  Stand up.
[01:52:50.076 --> 01:52:51.256]  Now is the time to act.
[01:52:55.805 --> 01:53:01.008]  He's the author of the New York Times best-selling Death of the West, a new book, Day of Reckoning.
[01:53:01.028 --> 01:53:05.651]  And you talk about hubris, greed, the rest of it, Pat.
[01:53:06.751 --> 01:53:16.637]  The establishment knows that they're using these illegal aliens and the tens of millions of legals as well to break down sovereignty so the corporates can control this country.
[01:53:17.877 --> 01:53:21.219]  But as you said, there's a huge realignment happening.
[01:53:21.899 --> 01:53:22.860]  Where do you see this going?
[01:53:23.727 --> 01:53:26.171]  Well, you know, we're going to have to wait and see in the election.
[01:53:27.132 --> 01:53:39.911]  Ron Paul is a wonderful man to have out there, and you've got Tom Tancredo, who is courageous on the borders, and frankly on the borders and on sovereignty and on trade.
[01:53:40.493 --> 01:53:45.556]  On fair trade and the idea of bringing the jobs home, Duncan Hunter is excellent.
[01:53:46.216 --> 01:53:54.762]  And my concern is, though, is that clearly I think that these fellas do understand a lot of this, and I'm not sure, however, that they're going to win it.
[01:53:54.842 --> 01:54:08.930]  So as you look at the presidential race, when it comes down to the end, I think you're either going to have Hillary or Barack Obama on one side, and my guess would be Romney or Rudy or Huckabee on the other.
[01:54:09.488 --> 01:54:10.048]  That's a guess.
[01:54:10.108 --> 01:54:14.571]  Fred Thompson's a good man, but I find it hard to see where he's going to win his first primary.
[01:54:15.271 --> 01:54:19.173]  So that's the real power center of the White House.
[01:54:19.233 --> 01:54:22.855]  So what happens in the next four or five years if Democrats do get in?
[01:54:23.215 --> 01:54:24.936]  They have a very low approval rating, too.
[01:54:24.976 --> 01:54:27.597]  It just seems the revolution for liberty is just going to grow.
[01:54:27.617 --> 01:54:28.678]  I think you're right.
[01:54:29.298 --> 01:54:32.179]  That is an excellent point, Alex.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:32.580]  It's this.
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:34.301]  Look, these people are out of touch.
[01:54:34.721 --> 01:54:37.022]  The amnesty bill showed how far out of touch they are.
[01:54:37.702 --> 01:54:48.369]  If Hillary gets in, there'll be the quote, path to citizenship, the security fence will not be built, there'll be some lax enforcement of the immigration laws, and a firestorm will build.
[01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:49.689]  This is not going away.
[01:54:49.710 --> 01:54:52.731]  This illegal alien issue is not going away.
[01:54:52.751 --> 01:54:53.792]  Where do you see Iraq going?
[01:54:55.877 --> 01:54:59.398]  I think we're going to find out when we bring home those five combat brigades.
[01:54:59.678 --> 01:55:13.763]  Clearly, Petraeus has succeeded in what he has done so far, and he's pacified Baghdad, or helped pacify it, and we've armed the Sunni militias out there, but what those fellows are going to do once they take care of al-Qaeda, who they're coming after, we're going to find out.
[01:55:14.803 --> 01:55:24.806]  My hope is, and it's a hope, is that we leave something standing over there that is united in at least some way, and is at least pro-Western.
[01:55:25.325 --> 01:55:27.727]  But that is a lot more than it is an expectation.
[01:55:27.747 --> 01:55:52.504]  Pat, in closing, the White House put this out three months ago, it had been in the news three years ago, that they're hiring, admitted, a number three man in Al-Qaeda, they have four different groups attacking the Iranians, and the news says the Iranians are Al-Qaeda, when they're the opposite group, Shiite, and you've got all these different warlords armed, and it's just going to go on and on, which was the original strategy that Israel wanted in the 80s, was to go in and break Iraq up in three parts!
[01:55:53.044 --> 01:55:55.847]  Well, the rack will break if they get a big haul.
[01:55:56.888 --> 01:56:07.017]  There's a sort of a neocon agenda just to get the whole thing to radicalize, dump it all over, and upset the whole chess table, and throw all the pieces on the floor.
[01:56:07.658 --> 01:56:11.962]  And I think that could be one of the results of this, the complete balkanization of that region.
[01:56:11.982 --> 01:56:12.783]  Look what's happened!
[01:56:13.263 --> 01:56:16.625]  I mean, before India broke apart, we saw Pakistan break apart.
[01:56:17.045 --> 01:56:18.786]  Iran's in danger of breaking apart.
[01:56:18.806 --> 01:56:20.306]  They've got problems in Balochistan.
[01:56:20.346 --> 01:56:23.128]  Is the New York Times agenda, though, stalling?
[01:56:23.348 --> 01:56:25.929]  Worldwide, they have lost any soft power they had.
[01:56:26.729 --> 01:56:27.790]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:56:27.850 --> 01:56:31.212]  And frankly, they've lost a lot of the hard power they had here in the United States.
[01:56:31.772 --> 01:56:40.476]  And frankly, with this report from the intelligence estimates, I don't think Bush has got the ability to launch the war on Iran.
[01:56:41.132 --> 01:56:45.574]  That the neoconservatives have been plotting and planning and propagandizing for months!
[01:56:46.615 --> 01:56:51.217]  So they're completely blown, but with... They're not completely blown, they've got the ability to slide back!
[01:56:52.597 --> 01:56:54.098]  So, so... Into power!
[01:56:54.398 --> 01:56:56.179]  You think the neocons may stay in power?
[01:56:56.779 --> 01:57:01.181]  I think they attach them... The neocons don't win elections, they attach themselves to winners.
[01:57:01.862 --> 01:57:07.144]  And I think in the Republican Party, some of the Republicans, Rudy Giuliani's is totally neocon foreign policy advisors.
[01:57:07.711 --> 01:57:09.032]  So you're against Giuliani?
[01:57:09.513 --> 01:57:13.176]  Well, you know, I'm not... I'm certainly not endorsing... I'm certainly not endorsing Rudy.
[01:57:14.477 --> 01:57:15.117]  Absolutely.
[01:57:15.217 --> 01:57:20.581]  Well, the new book, Day of Reckoning, in stores everywhere on Amazon.com by Patrick J. Buchanan.
[01:57:20.862 --> 01:57:22.143]  Pat, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:57:22.423 --> 01:57:23.284]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:23.584 --> 01:57:24.064]  Take care.
[01:57:24.545 --> 01:57:28.188]  All right, we'll be right back with the third hour with Dr. Corsi.
[01:57:28.448 --> 01:57:29.569]  Let's go ahead and get him on the line.
[01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:30.149]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:31.610]  You are listening to GPN.
[01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:41.018]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:57:51.528 --> 01:57:55.731]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:56.372 --> 01:57:57.192]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.953 --> 01:57:58.834]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.854 --> 01:58:03.437]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:03.697 --> 01:58:07.841]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.481 --> 01:58:18.449]  We're talking about the New World Order in the shower, we're talking about the European Union, its strategy of stealth, strategy of stealth integration on the North American continent, this new trade deal that Bush just got.
[01:58:19.393 --> 01:58:24.016]  Signed with Farouk, a big victory for the globalists, in a string of defeats.
[01:58:25.796 --> 01:58:32.640]  Dr. Corsi is one of the leading scholars on our side against the North American Union, and I wanted to get him on.
[01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:35.261]  At the bottom of the hour, we'll open the phones up on the North American Union.
[01:58:35.281 --> 01:58:41.525]  In fact, here's the number now, 1-800-259-9231, if you want to get lined up.
[01:58:42.085 --> 01:58:44.586]  Specifically, I'm asking to talk about these issues.
[01:58:44.626 --> 01:58:45.887]  It's a wide area of discussion.
[01:58:46.776 --> 01:58:53.426]  I want to get Dr. Courtsey on today to give us an update on Ramos and Campeon as well, the Valiant Border Patrol agents being framed and set up.
[01:58:54.347 --> 01:58:57.192]  But before we do that, I want to get into the North American Union and
[01:58:58.576 --> 01:59:06.101]  CNN saying Ron Paul's a liar, that the Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist when there's the official Trans-Texas Corridor state website with the feds.
[01:59:06.462 --> 01:59:08.383]  They say it's part of the Napa Superhighway.
[01:59:08.863 --> 01:59:10.424]  I have the federal government saying it.
[01:59:10.564 --> 01:59:12.926]  I have the Canadian government here in front of me.
[01:59:13.406 --> 01:59:17.109]  It says NAPTA trade corridors, Napa Superhighways.
[01:59:18.190 --> 01:59:24.314]  I mean, and I know I keep responding to this because folks, we've got to get out and warn the public.
[01:59:25.194 --> 01:59:33.496]  That this is a massive hoax, and if we use this hoax they perpetrated as a way to discredit them as an opportunity, we can save this country.
[01:59:33.716 --> 01:59:38.737]  If we let them engage in this hoax and win, they're going to be able to go ahead and finish this thing up.
[01:59:38.777 --> 01:59:40.218]  Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on.
[01:59:40.238 --> 01:59:41.018]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:41.058 --> 01:59:42.198]  Great pleasure to be with you.
[01:59:42.858 --> 01:59:46.059]  And I'm just writing a piece right now for World Net Daily tomorrow.
[01:59:46.739 --> 01:59:50.360]  You know, this Newsweek, the current issue, this Gretchel Kovach,
[01:59:51.187 --> 01:59:56.348]  I did a hit piece on Ron Paul and on World Ed Daily and me on this.
[01:59:56.408 --> 02:00:07.090]  You know, Ron Paul at the debate, the CNN debate, responded to the question about the North American Union by affirming that the globalists were planning to create a North American Union.
[02:00:07.130 --> 02:00:19.052]  And he referred to the NAFTA superhighway and used evidence, you know, Governor Perry vetoing the trans-Texas corridor, the legislation that was going to block the trans-Texas corridor.
[02:00:19.807 --> 02:00:20.007]  I don't
[02:00:40.129 --> 02:00:47.475]  Revise eminent domain in Texas to make it prohibitively expensive to get the land for this highway?
[02:00:48.135 --> 02:00:48.876]  Here's the big question.
[02:00:48.896 --> 02:00:52.558]  We're going to walk through all this evidence after the break.
[02:00:52.658 --> 02:00:55.721]  Just a year ago they were saying NAFTA superhighway is good.
[02:00:56.685 --> 02:00:59.327]  SPP's good, now they're just saying none of it exists.
[02:00:59.387 --> 02:01:00.828]  I mean, why do you think they've shifted?
[02:01:01.168 --> 02:01:02.989]  Well, I think it's been an orchestrated effort.
[02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:04.230]  I can see it from the White House.
[02:01:04.290 --> 02:01:20.361]  I mean, this traces back to when George Bush at Montebello, at the SPP meeting, was asked that question by the Fox News reporter, whether the Security and Prosperity Partnership was going to lead to a North American Union and NAFTA superhighways, and Bush did not answer the question.
[02:01:20.902 --> 02:01:22.923]  He didn't say, here's the reason it could never happen.
[02:01:23.604 --> 02:01:27.026]  He just poo-pooed it and said, well, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:01:27.106 --> 02:01:36.552]  And, you know, the problem is, Alex, we've known since the days of ancient Greek rhetoric that ridicule is the last refuge of a scoundrel in a debate.
[02:01:37.192 --> 02:01:43.616]  When President Bush could not answer the question by logic or evidence or argumentation, he called us all a name.
[02:01:44.396 --> 02:01:48.719]  And that's, you know, an attempt to have people not listen to what we're saying,
[02:01:49.437 --> 02:01:50.718]  But it doesn't answer the question.
[02:01:50.998 --> 02:01:53.160]  Ridicule is a low form of argumentation.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:56.942]  We have thousands of government websites, Mexico, Canada, U.S.
[02:01:56.982 --> 02:01:57.382]  saying it.
[02:01:57.823 --> 02:02:00.344]  Billboards everywhere pushing the trans-Texas corridor.
[02:02:00.404 --> 02:02:01.065]  Perry's saying it.
[02:02:01.585 --> 02:02:03.166]  Now they're saying that doesn't exist.
[02:02:03.406 --> 02:02:13.053]  What does CNN and Fox and MSNBC think Texans are going to do when they see the billboards everywhere and they're announcing it, and Perry's having press conferences and CNN says it doesn't exist?
[02:02:13.293 --> 02:02:15.615]  Well, and I've got 30 pages in the late, great USA.
[02:02:17.101 --> 02:02:21.484]  And as you know, they document the websites in which all this is happening.
[02:02:23.926 --> 02:02:24.887]  Government websites.
[02:02:24.907 --> 02:02:32.892]  We'll be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi to go over the evidence for those that may not know specifically what it is.
[02:02:32.912 --> 02:02:39.757]  I don't have time to play the Parliament in Canada and legislatures and Vicente Fox and Pastor admitting it all.
[02:02:39.857 --> 02:02:43.159]  It's all documented in Endgame and in Late Great USA.
[02:02:43.199 --> 02:02:45.401]  But we're going to walk through some of the other evidence.
[02:02:46.321 --> 02:02:54.247]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[02:02:54.707 --> 02:02:57.889]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[02:02:58.269 --> 02:03:01.311]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[02:03:50.542 --> 02:03:52.524]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.

[02:03:56.067 --> 02:03:57.488]  America, freedom to fascism.

[02:05:46.018 --> 02:05:51.081]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:51.461 --> 02:05:53.722]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:57.201 --> 02:06:14.596]  Now I'm not trying to beat a horse to death here, but this is the big issue.
[02:06:16.058 --> 02:06:18.440]  You find out that in 57 with the Treaty of Rome,
[02:06:19.233 --> 02:06:21.335]  They set up the European Union.
[02:06:21.355 --> 02:06:23.638]  They just had the 50th anniversary this year.
[02:06:24.218 --> 02:06:27.121]  Everybody thought it started in 2000, but they had the 50th anniversary this year.
[02:06:27.562 --> 02:06:32.707]  We've now gotten the founding documents and internal debates of the European Union.
[02:06:32.747 --> 02:06:34.729]  It was a strategy of stealth.
[02:06:35.493 --> 02:06:37.434]  It was a secretive implementation.
[02:06:37.994 --> 02:06:48.957]  And then the CFR writes books and puts out policy reports, and the editors of Time Magazine write articles about it, and they say it's all great and good, and literally thousands of quotes stating it and saying it and merging the bureaucracies.
[02:06:49.598 --> 02:06:55.279]  And then they use this military tactic of cloaking, of just flat-out lying.
[02:06:55.800 --> 02:07:03.162]  And Dr. Corsi, do you agree we need to press this issue and maybe challenge these Boston Globe writers to debates?
[02:07:04.057 --> 02:07:05.779]  I think I should have tried to get that guy on with you.
[02:07:05.799 --> 02:07:19.671]  To force the issue out into the open because this is actually an opportunity for those of us that know how to go to the official government websites and know how to look at billboards and know how to... Oh!
[02:07:21.912 --> 02:07:23.354]  And here's another point before I forget.
[02:07:23.374 --> 02:07:24.595]  I want you to comment on that.
[02:07:25.496 --> 02:07:26.937]  Is this an opportunity right now?
[02:07:26.957 --> 02:07:41.250]  And secondarily, earlier this year, you wrote about businesses in the Southwest and Texas who have employees getting state labor department forms demanding that they sign up with the North American New ID.
[02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:42.170]  Well, guess what?
[02:07:42.210 --> 02:07:46.194]  I've got eight employees here in Austin, and I got that last week, sir.
[02:07:46.534 --> 02:07:56.236]  Demanding I fill out all these questions for this new organization no longer reporting through the state to the federal Department of Labor, but now to this new international body.
[02:07:56.696 --> 02:08:01.157]  Yes, we got now North American job classifications, and it's been reorganized.
[02:08:01.197 --> 02:08:02.097]  I've been writing about it.
[02:08:02.117 --> 02:08:12.479]  To answer your first question, Alex, I'm going after Newsweek in an article that I hope to be published on Thursday or Friday, tomorrow or Friday, in World Net Daily.
[02:08:12.499 --> 02:08:14.340]  I mean, I've just got off the phone.
[02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:15.480]  Newsweek wrote this piece
[02:08:16.175 --> 02:08:23.580]  Again, ridiculing Ron Paul in the debate and ridiculing me for proposing this NAFTA superhighway in the North American Union.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:42.531]  I just got off the phone with State Senator Randy Brogdon in Oklahoma, and he just said, you know, Senate Joint Resolution 22 was submitted to the Oklahoma Legislature in 1995, and it called for the creation of a NAFTA superhighway by name.
[02:08:44.284 --> 02:08:54.110]  I'm getting, I'm going to get a hold of that state, that Senate Joint Resolution 22 this afternoon, and I'll be able to post that and link to it on the site.
[02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:56.031]  But I mean, there's plenty of evidence.
[02:08:56.472 --> 02:09:04.256]  Randy Brogan's been fighting for two years in the state legislature to block laws that have been introduced to extend the trans-Texas corridor north.
[02:09:04.276 --> 02:09:06.478]  I mean, that's evidence right there.
[02:09:07.238 --> 02:09:09.300]  There's dozens of government websites.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.521]  I'll give you another couple of quotes here.
[02:09:11.561 --> 02:09:13.082]  I mean, Amanda Teagarden, who
[02:09:14.197 --> 02:09:16.519]  ...is head of Oklahoma OK Safe.
[02:09:17.219 --> 02:09:19.101]  I spoke to the OK Safe group.
[02:09:19.821 --> 02:09:26.065]  It's a non-profit group set up in Oklahoma, also dedicated to block the Trans-Texas Corridor coming north.
[02:09:26.706 --> 02:09:33.210]  A couple months ago I spoke to 300 people in Tulsa on a Saturday that OK Safe had organized.
[02:09:33.951 --> 02:09:40.835]  And, you know, a man in Teagarden is writing me off saying, why is Newsweek resorting to name-calling?
[02:09:40.855 --> 02:09:43.097]  This author says it's paranoia.
[02:09:43.564 --> 02:09:45.685]  But she doesn't have a degree in psychology.
[02:09:45.746 --> 02:09:49.028]  How can she make that diagnosis?
[02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:51.369]  This is an organized campaign, Alex.
[02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:53.191]  President Bush starts it.
[02:09:53.231 --> 02:10:06.480]  He says down in, you know, up in the meeting in Montebello, Quebec, it's asked by a Fox News reporter, a third summit meeting of the Security and Prosperity Partnership, if SPP is going to lead to a North American Union or NAFTA superhighways.
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:10.002]  And President Bush says, that's just a conspiracy theory.
[02:10:10.703 --> 02:10:12.364]  So now then, we get a bunch of articles.
[02:10:12.404 --> 02:10:16.387]  I think that word went out for the White House to attack this by ridiculing it.
[02:10:17.347 --> 02:10:22.211]  And, you know, Michael Medved has been launching this crusade on the radio.
[02:10:22.571 --> 02:10:23.411]  It's a tirade.
[02:10:23.612 --> 02:10:24.532]  But here's the problem.
[02:10:24.552 --> 02:10:26.514]  We'll talk about that in a moment, Dr. Corsi.
[02:10:27.074 --> 02:10:33.418]  I mean, I literally get 10, 15 emails a day from different governments, state websites, official announcements.
[02:10:33.438 --> 02:10:35.339]  These are pro-NAFTA superhighway.
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:36.540]  But I mean, here's one today.
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:37.741]  Alberta government
[02:10:37.961 --> 02:10:38.781]  Yes, I saw that.
[02:10:39.261 --> 02:10:50.043]  And it's infotrans.gov.ab.ca, and it calls it the NAFTA Superhighway, and it shows I-35, the Camino Real Road, the Canamex.
[02:10:50.103 --> 02:10:51.464]  These are all the same official maps.
[02:10:51.744 --> 02:10:59.145]  They say it's already being built, but then we go to their website and go, look, the government, the government says, and they go, you're crazy, that doesn't exist.
[02:10:59.405 --> 02:11:02.906]  Well, you know, take a look at this Newsweek article, because if you go through it,
[02:11:03.484 --> 02:11:05.626]  There were comments posted in Newsweek.
[02:11:05.666 --> 02:11:08.428]  There were 65 comments posted.
[02:11:09.008 --> 02:11:11.730]  And every one of these comments was critical of a Newsweek article.
[02:11:11.771 --> 02:11:16.034]  People say, this is why I cancelled my subscription to Newsweek 10 years ago.
[02:11:16.638 --> 02:11:20.562]  They say this reporter didn't do her homework and didn't do her research.
[02:11:21.202 --> 02:11:32.492]  They're linking, the people commenting and responding to this Newsweek article on the Newsweek website are, they're linking to the Council on Foreign Relations report on building a North American Union.
[02:11:32.913 --> 02:11:35.695]  They're linking to the Trans-Texas Corridor website.
[02:11:36.256 --> 02:11:41.000]  They're linking to, when Vincente Fox was with Larry King,
[02:11:41.596 --> 02:11:48.438]  Promoting his book, and he's telling the Larry King Live Show, he admitted that there was a plan to create a regional currency out of NAFTA.
[02:11:48.478 --> 02:11:55.501]  Well, that's the issue here, is that mainstream newspapers, mainstream magazines, TV, their ratings are all imploding.
[02:11:56.341 --> 02:12:05.824]  They're now saying that Ron Paul and others, they've named you, I've got a bunch of these newscasts where they say, quote, he is a figment of his imagination, he's mentally ill,
[02:12:06.639 --> 02:12:10.380]  And Ron Paul drives around on Texas roads where the signs are everywhere, put up by the state.
[02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:14.562]  I mean, this is such a bold hoax, Dr. Corsi.
[02:12:14.622 --> 02:12:17.923]  What I think, Alex, is it's a coordinated attack.
[02:12:18.563 --> 02:12:19.864]  I think it comes out of the White House.
[02:12:20.504 --> 02:12:27.266]  To find reporters, Newsweek, we've had a hit piece in Nation Magazine and other reporters saying the NAFTA highway didn't exist.
[02:12:27.706 --> 02:12:29.627]  We've had that piece in Boston Globe.
[02:12:30.347 --> 02:12:44.890]  I think the White House is doing everything it can to recruit people on this theme to write about that this is a hoax, that NAFTA Superhighway doesn't exist, and it's in large part because we're being as successful as we are at getting people to look at the evidence.
[02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:54.011]  I've got 30 pages in the late great USA with government footnotes in there, and I did it on the theme, Alex, that it's like the country western song.
[02:12:54.031 --> 02:12:57.732]  You know, it's the woman finds the husband in bed with another woman.
[02:12:58.388 --> 02:13:03.052]  And before the lying starts, the husband says, dear, this is not what you think it is.
[02:13:03.072 --> 02:13:04.833]  You know, we're going to get the explanation.
[02:13:04.893 --> 02:13:06.074]  He's just giving dictation.
[02:13:06.114 --> 02:13:07.575]  It's a little bit cold in the room.
[02:13:08.276 --> 02:13:09.217]  The wife's got a choice.
[02:13:09.257 --> 02:13:12.620]  She can believe what her husband's going to tell her or her own lying eyes.
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:23.088]  And, you know, I'm confident that when the American public take the time to look at the government websites, the denials that are coming out for the government are going to look
[02:13:23.706 --> 02:13:27.776]  You know, like lies and just an effort to hide the truth which is what it is.
[02:13:33.371 --> 02:13:34.191]  Amnesty Bill.
[02:13:34.432 --> 02:13:36.112]  It's secret, but just trust us.
[02:13:36.412 --> 02:13:40.394]  This bill would normally be public, but we're making it secret for the first time in U.S.
[02:13:40.434 --> 02:13:40.794]  history.
[02:13:41.434 --> 02:13:44.115]  And then when Senator Sessions leaked it, it was worse.
[02:13:44.415 --> 02:13:53.559]  And Pat Buchanan just agreed in the last hour, didn't agree, brought it up himself, that it was literally a pardon for criminals, both employers and aggravated felony legal aliens,
[02:13:54.379 --> 02:14:01.507]  And so they got caught lying on that, and so just more and more, this seems like total desperation.
[02:14:01.747 --> 02:14:03.329]  How about the Trans-Texas Corridor?
[02:14:03.349 --> 02:14:16.262]  The Texas Department of Transportation refused for the longest time to publish, you know, the agreement they'd made with Cintra, C-I-N-T-R-A, the investment consortium in Spain that's going to put this highway in place.
[02:14:17.371 --> 02:14:23.816]  And finally, a lawsuit forced the Texas Department of Transportation to publish the agreement.
[02:14:24.277 --> 02:14:25.838]  And when it was published, it was shocking.
[02:14:25.918 --> 02:14:32.303]  The non-compete agreement, the concessions that Central was going to get revenue promised by this highway.
[02:14:32.323 --> 02:14:35.906]  It's just a handover for campaign contributions of the infrastructure.
[02:14:35.966 --> 02:14:38.828]  And the campaign cut doesn't trace the campaign contribution.
[02:14:38.988 --> 02:14:39.709]  Perry has gotten
[02:14:40.169 --> 02:14:48.073]  Strong campaign contributions, not just from Sintra and Zachary, the construction firm that's going to build the highway, but from Bracewell and Giuliani.
[02:14:48.513 --> 02:14:59.719]  Go check how many contributions Bracewell and Giuliani have made to Governor Perry, and that's the law firm of Rudy Giuliani that is the sole legal representative of Sintra in the United States.
[02:15:00.199 --> 02:15:04.982]  But if you ask Rudy Giuliani about NAFTA superhighways, he's going to deny it too.
[02:15:05.620 --> 02:15:07.924]  They don't, any of them, want anybody looking into the money trail.
[02:15:07.944 --> 02:15:08.925]  But I go back to this.
[02:15:09.046 --> 02:15:16.097]  How can CNN and several other cable networks say that the Trans-Texas Corridor
[02:15:16.929 --> 02:15:17.830]  Doesn't exist.
[02:15:18.150 --> 02:15:29.821]  Well, it's ridiculous, because CNN's also got Lou Dobbs on it, and Lou Dobbs has been strongly on this theme, you know, supporting the idea that the North American Union and the NAFTA superhighways are reality.
[02:15:30.022 --> 02:15:32.764]  Did you see the report where they had, like, six talking heads on there?
[02:15:33.145 --> 02:15:37.929]  All in little squares, like the Brady Bunch, and they were all laughing and saying, these people are nuts!
[02:15:38.129 --> 02:15:39.491]  Well, they had a similar thing.
[02:15:39.511 --> 02:15:40.892]  Brit Hume had a similar thing.
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:54.454]  With, you know, Charles Krauthammer and the others in this round table on the light show on Fox, and Krauthammer sitting there saying, oh, none of this is true, and then admitting he went to a Bilderberger conference.
[02:15:55.359 --> 02:16:01.121]  I mean, sure, it's nothing going on there, but why did he go to the Bilderberg conference?
[02:16:01.181 --> 02:16:07.983]  And how does anybody know that there was nothing going on when those records are also kept secret and not allowed to be published?
[02:16:08.003 --> 02:16:12.124]  Well, Dr. Coors, do you remember ten years ago when they would say in the news that the Bilderberg didn't exist?
[02:16:12.524 --> 02:16:12.784]  Right.
[02:16:13.425 --> 02:16:17.886]  It all didn't exist, and now we've got the list of attendees, we've got some of the meeting agendas.
[02:16:18.422 --> 02:16:20.964]  You know, I've got another book fully documenting it.
[02:16:21.564 --> 02:16:24.846]  There's this book that Estulin just wrote.
[02:16:24.866 --> 02:16:30.090]  I thought it was an excellent book documenting the attendance of the Burger Builder groups and their agendas.
[02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:35.233]  Alex, I just wrote an article about the North American Forum meeting that went on in Cancun.
[02:16:35.814 --> 02:16:36.634]  Oh, exactly!
[02:16:36.774 --> 02:16:39.696]  And they've had joint sessions of Congress down there.
[02:16:39.736 --> 02:16:41.057]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[02:16:41.077 --> 02:16:44.920]  But for now, listeners, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement
[02:16:45.839 --> 02:16:47.942]  And we've got it in stock right now.
[02:16:48.202 --> 02:16:51.487]  My new film is basically Escalon's book in video format.
[02:16:51.507 --> 02:16:52.729]  The first half is.
[02:16:52.769 --> 02:16:56.134]  And then it gets into the eugenics and the rest of the agenda in the second half.
[02:16:56.574 --> 02:17:01.001]  Get the new video with Dr. Corsi's book that we have in stock.
[02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:02.771]  We have it in stock.
[02:17:03.211 --> 02:17:05.152]  It has been continually selling out in stores.
[02:17:05.552 --> 02:17:10.854]  We have the late great USA for the friends, the family, the neighbors that are in denial.
[02:17:11.214 --> 02:17:18.738]  You cannot beat a double whammy of the late great USA comboed with endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:17:19.098 --> 02:17:21.279]  I mean, an endgame blueprint for global enslavement, we have
[02:17:22.065 --> 02:17:22.725]  It is a big idea.
[02:17:22.745 --> 02:17:23.345]  A New World Order.
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:55.863]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:17:55.903 --> 02:17:57.324]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:17:58.385 --> 02:18:00.626]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:18:01.186 --> 02:18:03.628]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:18:04.368 --> 02:18:11.693]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:18:14.688 --> 02:18:19.690]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:23.611]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:18:24.011 --> 02:18:26.512]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:18:26.572 --> 02:18:27.532]  Most people have no idea.
[02:18:27.552 --> 02:18:28.452]  They're not after money.
[02:18:28.472 --> 02:18:29.593]  They have all the money they need.
[02:18:29.813 --> 02:18:30.553]  They're after power.
[02:18:30.793 --> 02:18:31.573]  That's their after mission.
[02:18:31.933 --> 02:18:40.116]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:18:40.276 --> 02:18:43.017]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:18:43.437 --> 02:18:44.678]  You have been warned.
[02:18:45.858 --> 02:18:48.240]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:54.603]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:18:55.632 --> 02:19:02.974]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[02:19:03.875 --> 02:19:08.576]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:19:09.096 --> 02:19:14.518]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful one-world government?
[02:19:15.618 --> 02:19:23.701]  We would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:19:59.034 --> 02:20:05.776]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions.
[02:20:06.116 --> 02:20:06.336]  We're good.

[02:20:45.672 --> 02:20:50.254]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:20:50.635 --> 02:20:53.576]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:20:53.896 --> 02:20:56.458]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:20:56.838 --> 02:21:01.640]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:21:02.021 --> 02:21:07.403]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:21:07.703 --> 02:21:10.665]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:21:10.845 --> 02:21:11.425]  We're good to go.

[02:21:44.379 --> 02:21:53.104]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:53.764 --> 02:21:56.086]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:01.076 --> 02:22:06.723]  Don't forget that they formed the European Union by stealth, and I guess they'll deny it exists next.
[02:22:08.585 --> 02:22:17.975]  And then they keep trying to get England to join, they try to package it under different laws, different treaties, and the people keep saying no, and the documents have come out that they have a stealth approach there.
[02:22:17.995 --> 02:22:19.237]  It's called deception.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:27.046]  And they're doing it here, and it doesn't matter if they've had joint sessions of Congress in Mexico, it doesn't matter if they've had these big meetings.
[02:22:27.587 --> 02:22:30.630]  You watch these on C-SPAN, they come right out and say it's all happening.
[02:22:30.650 --> 02:22:31.791]  Dr. Corsi, break it down.
[02:22:33.177 --> 02:22:38.282]  I mean, there's a great book, Christopher Booker and Richard North, called The Great Deception.
[02:22:38.923 --> 02:22:44.428]  It's an exhaustive treatment of how the European Union was formed, and it documents the stealth plan.
[02:22:44.888 --> 02:22:48.132]  They have John Monet, who knew he wanted to be the Frenchman.
[02:22:48.172 --> 02:22:50.734]  He didn't want Germany to rise up with another army.
[02:22:50.754 --> 02:22:53.597]  He thought he needed to end the sovereignty of Germany.
[02:22:54.124 --> 02:23:17.002]  But he couldn't announce that, so he started with the Coal and Steel Agreement in 1957, figuring if Europe controlled the coal and steel, Germany could not have another army, and believing that the economic agreements would lead to the regional necessity for political, legal, and judicial structures that would solve the international trade disputes the European Common Market would necessitate happening.
[02:23:17.903 --> 02:23:22.627]  And all through this, the strategy in Europe was to deny
[02:23:23.348 --> 02:23:26.290]  That anything was being planned more than a common market.
[02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:34.695]  And that's the same strategy that is being taken right now by the Bush administration and those who have this North American integration effort.
[02:23:34.715 --> 02:23:40.218]  I mean, you know, just this past week I wrote about the North American Forum.
[02:23:40.738 --> 02:23:48.783]  George Shultz having another meeting, Robert Pastor attending it from American University, down in Cancun, a closed-door session.
[02:23:49.403 --> 02:23:51.905]  And again, we got the agenda of the meeting.
[02:23:52.543 --> 02:23:54.965]  And the meeting is all about North American integration.
[02:23:54.985 --> 02:23:56.767]  You know, where do we go from here?
[02:23:57.227 --> 02:24:00.530]  What are the economic consequences of North American integration?
[02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:07.295]  It was an active agenda, again attended by the same people who attended the Banff meeting.
[02:24:07.856 --> 02:24:09.457]  We published there the agenda.
[02:24:09.837 --> 02:24:16.763]  We published the attendee list of the Banff meeting, which was for integration of North America.
[02:24:17.584 --> 02:24:18.765]  The websites abound.
[02:24:18.865 --> 02:24:20.906]  I mean, go to spp.gov.
[02:24:22.197 --> 02:24:37.467]  I've published, on page 81 of the book, the organizational chart of the SPP working groups, reporting up to three cabinet secretaries of each government, and into the White House, through the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council, to the President.
[02:24:38.007 --> 02:24:42.951]  But I got that chart, the organizational chart, from a Freedom of Information Act request.
[02:24:43.411 --> 02:24:45.552]  The federal government doesn't publish it anywhere.
[02:24:45.572 --> 02:24:49.715]  And, you know, if I can get the chart through a Freedom of Information Act request,
[02:24:50.376 --> 02:24:51.196]  But it's not published.
[02:24:51.216 --> 02:24:57.459]  That, to me, is the documentation of a shadow government trilateral bureaucracy already in place.
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:05.263]  Why is the government ashamed to publish the organizational chart of the SPP Working Groups that it uses internally?
[02:25:05.283 --> 02:25:07.204]  I mean, it's disgraceful!
[02:25:07.404 --> 02:25:11.166]  And then to deny... If you go to SPP.gov, you get the denials.
[02:25:11.686 --> 02:25:12.667]  This versus facts.
[02:25:13.331 --> 02:25:16.673]  Says that all this is is a dialogue between three countries.
[02:25:17.034 --> 02:25:24.459]  I've got 2,000 pages in my file drawer of emails, memos, and meetings that SPP.gov has held.
[02:25:24.619 --> 02:25:26.901]  I got them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
[02:25:27.661 --> 02:25:37.628]  And, you know, the deniers want you to believe that if you click that SPP.gov website the right way, it's going to start playing you Bobby McFerrin music.
[02:25:37.668 --> 02:25:39.610]  You know, don't worry, be happy.
[02:25:40.922 --> 02:25:50.129]  Well, that's what they're doing, and if you go to the SQP site, they'll have a debunking myth section that lies, but then right there on their own site is all the facts.
[02:25:50.730 --> 02:25:51.390]  Right, read that.
[02:25:51.450 --> 02:25:55.534]  Go to read the 2005 and 2006 report to the leaders.
[02:25:56.354 --> 02:25:59.897]  Look for the discussion of the trusted traders and trusted travelers.
[02:26:00.537 --> 02:26:05.641]  You'll see their preparation to start issuing what will amount to a North American passport.
[02:26:05.822 --> 02:26:07.863]  North American Union passport is right there.
[02:26:08.183 --> 02:26:10.065]  Have you heard the state of Manitoba's
[02:26:12.833 --> 02:26:20.759]  State of the State address where the head of the legislature just says, we're merging, it's wonderful, and he just says it all.
[02:26:21.019 --> 02:26:25.963]  Yeah, it's been on the internet, it's on, I've watched it two or three times now.
[02:26:26.504 --> 02:26:30.887]  Also, I mean, go to SPP.gov and there's Trusted Trader, Trusted Traveler.
[02:26:30.927 --> 02:26:35.491]  I have an article today in World Met Daily about the Mexican trucks again.
[02:26:36.129 --> 02:26:50.881]  They're coming across an SPP-created fast lanes with SPP-issued electronic identification as trusted traders of North America in this Department of Transportation, you know, Mexican truck demonstration project.
[02:26:51.382 --> 02:26:59.288]  We've now got about 10 Mexican trucking companies sending their rigs north on all this SPP-approved fast lanes.
[02:27:00.069 --> 02:27:05.193]  And I documented today the owner-operator's Trucking Association, Oneida,
[02:27:05.925 --> 02:27:07.546]  They're filing a suit to block this.
[02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:12.547]  And they document hundreds of safety violations of these Mexican trucks.
[02:27:13.207 --> 02:27:15.188]  But they're still coming across the border every day.
[02:27:15.848 --> 02:27:20.990]  Because they're under international rules, not domestic, but then those trucks don't exist either.
[02:27:22.410 --> 02:27:31.633]  But really, the tactic the establishment is using is denying all this so we spend our time proving it exists instead of just removing it.
[02:27:31.693 --> 02:27:34.194]  Let's talk about ways to dismantle this, Dr. Gorsy.
[02:27:36.357 --> 02:27:39.340]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.766 --> 02:27:48.447]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:27:48.587 --> 02:27:53.771]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:27:53.952 --> 02:27:55.293]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:27:55.553 --> 02:28:03.719]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:28:03.959 --> 02:28:09.684]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:28:09.844 --> 02:28:11.625]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:28:11.685 --> 02:28:13.847]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:28:13.867 --> 02:28:18.230]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:28:18.390 --> 02:28:20.532]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:28:20.632 --> 02:28:28.077]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:28:28.237 --> 02:28:28.718]  I'm healthy.
[02:28:46.034 --> 02:28:46.674]  It's a fact.
[02:28:46.894 --> 02:28:54.376]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:28:54.496 --> 02:29:03.358]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:29:03.618 --> 02:29:14.161]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:29:14.441 --> 02:29:20.503]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:29:20.703 --> 02:29:25.724]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:29:25.924 --> 02:29:30.406]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:29:30.566 --> 02:29:32.366]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:29:32.406 --> 02:29:32.666]  That's 877-943-8600.

[02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:45.290]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[02:29:46.210 --> 02:29:50.471]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:29:50.731 --> 02:29:55.632]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:29:55.812 --> 02:29:57.152]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:29:57.333 --> 02:30:00.673]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?
[02:30:00.933 --> 02:30:06.115]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[02:30:12.456 --> 02:30:14.838]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[02:30:21.121 --> 02:30:22.042]  No animal testing.
[02:30:22.322 --> 02:30:23.623]  I use them and love them.
[02:30:23.643 --> 02:30:25.244]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:30:25.544 --> 02:30:26.644]  And I save big time.
[02:30:26.944 --> 02:30:28.185]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:30:28.205 --> 02:30:28.425]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:30:38.411 --> 02:30:41.113]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:31:10.604 --> 02:31:12.424]  Folks, we have a sponsor, Arthelin.
[02:31:14.125 --> 02:31:22.487]  The website is 321relief.com, and you know, before we take any of these medical type sponsors, or some of them are sponsors, we go and investigate it.
[02:31:22.727 --> 02:31:24.188]  We turned down about 9 out of 10.
[02:31:25.308 --> 02:31:34.171]  This is just a compilation of a whole bunch of well-known anti-inflammatory, naturally occurring plants.
[02:31:35.234 --> 02:31:40.838]  And I suggest you just go to 321relief.com to look into this.
[02:31:41.579 --> 02:31:42.980]  321relief.com.
[02:31:44.060 --> 02:31:59.271]  And it's just got, it's a cocktail of everything from frankincense to the mucklebush, cypress to zinzibarb, you name it.
[02:31:59.772 --> 02:32:01.513]  And each one of these is well known.
[02:32:04.620 --> 02:32:08.323]  Uh, to be, uh, very, very effective against arthritis.
[02:32:08.983 --> 02:32:11.985]  So, 321relief.com, 321relief.com, or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365, 321relief.com, or there is a banner up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:32:12.005 --> 02:32:12.486]  Uh, also,
[02:32:27.105 --> 02:32:31.306]  Christmas is almost here, and let me tell you what you need to give your loved ones.
[02:32:31.486 --> 02:32:35.488]  You need to give them a copy of the Late Great USA of their readers, as they say.
[02:32:35.508 --> 02:32:45.051]  The book is full of documents, their own statements, their own quotes, their own government plans, their own maps, proving the destruction of our sovereignty and the setting up of the North American Union.
[02:32:46.291 --> 02:32:54.394]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement mirrors the info and then gets into their larger global plans and what their endgame is.
[02:32:55.245 --> 02:32:59.566]  And it gets into just how sick and controlling and micromanaging these people are.
[02:32:59.666 --> 02:33:01.066]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:33:01.106 --> 02:33:05.147]  Big discounts on the book and the DVD separately or when you get them together.
[02:33:05.167 --> 02:33:11.309]  Or call toll-free and tell them you want the Late Great USA in-game combo or if you have one or the other, just get them singularly.
[02:33:12.009 --> 02:33:19.571]  That's all, again, by calling 888-253-3139 or you can simply write to me.
[02:33:20.131 --> 02:33:23.272]  And if you want it in time for Christmas, go ahead and get your letters in the mail by the end of this week.
[02:33:24.072 --> 02:33:30.777]  So that we get it in by the 16th, because that's the last day where we can guarantee the VA UPS shipping.
[02:33:30.797 --> 02:33:32.198]  They'll have it days before Christmas.
[02:33:32.578 --> 02:33:38.261]  So again, now is the time to take action, ladies and gentlemen, and give the gift of truth this holiday season.
[02:33:38.281 --> 02:33:40.023]  This Christmas, 888-253-3139.
[02:33:40.043 --> 02:33:42.704]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:33:52.837 --> 02:33:54.679]  And we also have the year-end special.
[02:33:54.719 --> 02:33:56.260]  We only do this at the end of the year.
[02:33:57.881 --> 02:34:01.124]  And it's five free months at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:01.144 --> 02:34:08.209]  You can always sign up for $5.95 at PrisonPlanet.tv for all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, hundreds of my TV shows.
[02:34:08.269 --> 02:34:10.251]  Download them, burn them to disk, give them to people.
[02:34:10.571 --> 02:34:13.193]  Great way to get hardcore info to wake folks up.
[02:34:14.197 --> 02:34:22.144]  You can get a $5.95 trial membership or get a yearly membership just during this month of December and you will be able to get 5.3 months free.
[02:34:22.184 --> 02:34:29.030]  It's almost half a year free is what it comes down to from the regular price when you get a yearly membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:29.450 --> 02:34:35.255]  Going back to Dr. Courtesy and then to the loaded phones, Dr. Courtesy, going into the break,
[02:34:37.435 --> 02:34:39.797]  I wanted to know your ideas for solutions.
[02:34:39.837 --> 02:34:42.720]  I mean, all day we sit here and try to prove it to the people.
[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:44.361]  The people are starting to wake up to it.
[02:34:44.842 --> 02:34:46.223]  How do we put this into action?
[02:34:46.243 --> 02:34:52.929]  Because I know through different international agreements, they come in and set up regulatory systems at the county, city, state level.
[02:34:52.989 --> 02:34:57.854]  They fly our city managers, county commissioners, the National Association of Counties, governors,
[02:34:58.594 --> 02:35:02.777]  You know, the bonding houses literally give them higher ratings and they'll sign on to this.
[02:35:03.077 --> 02:35:04.919]  I mean, this is all a mass fraud.
[02:35:04.939 --> 02:35:14.785]  As Pat Buchanan said last hour, with now almost half of the top 100 economies being corporations, they're just looting us old-fashioned style, like the British East India Company.
[02:35:15.025 --> 02:35:16.106]  How do we counter this?
[02:35:17.007 --> 02:35:19.128]  I think, Alex, it's starting at a grassroots level.
[02:35:20.009 --> 02:35:26.433]  We've got some 14 states that have passed resolutions saying, no North American unions, no NAFTA superhighways.
[02:35:27.096 --> 02:35:38.425]  We've got legislators like Randy Brogdon in Oklahoma, and groups like Oklahoma Safe, which is organizing to block the NAFTA Superhighway, the Trans-Texas Corridor, from coming into Oklahoma.
[02:35:38.986 --> 02:35:41.828]  The grassroots are, I think, where the difference is going to be made.
[02:35:41.908 --> 02:35:52.957]  And as people, as we go into what I strongly suspect is going to be a very serious economic downturn, a major recession that we're headed into, as millions of people lose their homes.
[02:35:53.837 --> 02:35:55.699]  You know, Alan Blinder, this,
[02:35:56.169 --> 02:36:09.121]  Economist at Princeton who advised Bill Clinton to get NAFTA passed, he said, we're going to lose 40 million jobs in the next two decades, largely to China and to India, and this outsourcing to slaves.
[02:36:10.222 --> 02:36:22.133]  I think as people lose their jobs, as states like Ohio and Michigan, you know, become echoes of their former self, look like Appalachia, as Chrysler goes over and
[02:36:22.614 --> 02:36:29.076]  Works with Cherry, this Chinese company that manufactures cars and shuts down car manufacturing in Detroit.
[02:36:30.016 --> 02:36:37.939]  These are going to impact people's lives and these sufferings, these economic hardships, as the middle class gets disassembled in the United States.
[02:36:37.999 --> 02:36:40.940]  People are going to wake up and say, there's got to be a reason for this.
[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:44.581]  You know, there's 10% of Mexico's population living in the United States.
[02:36:45.188 --> 02:36:51.130]  We've got 47 Mexican... By the way, that's all the Fed's own numbers, which are probably twice that.
[02:36:51.330 --> 02:36:54.711]  Even the Fed's numbers say it's going to be 20% in 2010.
[02:36:55.431 --> 02:36:58.492]  I didn't vote for 10% of Mexico's population to live here.
[02:36:58.552 --> 02:36:59.172]  Nobody did.
[02:36:59.613 --> 02:37:03.114]  It's a fait accompli created in the incremental method.
[02:37:03.574 --> 02:37:10.876]  And as people see this and say, why are we six years into a war on terror and our borders aren't yet secured?
[02:37:11.416 --> 02:37:13.617]  Why are we letting Mexican trucks come across the border?
[02:37:14.113 --> 02:37:20.035]  When President Bush wants to give $1.4 billion to Mexico to fight the drug war.
[02:37:20.055 --> 02:37:25.917]  And Dr. Corsi, isn't that why they're rushing right now to try to get the MSU to try to get the Napa Superhighway in?
[02:37:25.937 --> 02:37:33.820]  Because they know that their window of opportunity is closing because as their globalist policies hurt the people, that's going to form more resistance.
[02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:35.501]  And I think, yes it is.
[02:37:36.644 --> 02:37:42.027]  Alex, the reason we're getting this blowback about conspiracy theory is that there's two things.
[02:37:42.207 --> 02:37:46.709]  One, you know, the globalists pushing this agenda are being hurt by the exposure.
[02:37:47.390 --> 02:37:57.235]  Exposure, I think both now President Bush and Stephen Harper are afraid to come out and openly support SPP, and I challenge them to do that or close it down.
[02:37:57.775 --> 02:38:02.898]  They won't do it because they know they'll lose political capital just mentioning SPP.
[02:38:03.418 --> 02:38:06.060]  George Bush does not stop talking about Mexico.
[02:38:06.676 --> 02:38:18.543]  You know, if we go into the elections in 2008, and Rommel and Compey and the Border Patrol agents are still in prison, the Republican Party is going to lose the White House and two-thirds of the House and Senate.
[02:38:18.864 --> 02:38:21.225]  And it isn't going to be because people like Democrats.
[02:38:21.894 --> 02:38:33.036]  You know, if Hillary Clinton gets elected, I'm saying she'll be another globalist, Bush-Clinton dynasty, so let her get inaugurated on January 20th, let's start the impeachment proceedings on January 21st.
[02:38:33.056 --> 02:38:39.497]  Alright, let's shift gears on the economy, because I know, real fast, give folks your credentials on what's happening with the markets.
[02:38:39.777 --> 02:38:47.159]  Well, I mean, I've got a Harvard PhD in political science, I've studied economics, including at Harvard.
[02:38:48.949 --> 02:38:54.012]  All the NASD, National Security Association licenses, I've created two broker-dealers.
[02:38:54.493 --> 02:38:57.815]  I've worked 25 years in financial services with banks around the world.
[02:38:57.955 --> 02:38:59.155]  Well, I know you're info's spot-on.
[02:38:59.215 --> 02:39:00.876]  I just wanted to put that back out.
[02:39:00.916 --> 02:39:02.337]  You're saying the same thing, Ron Paul.
[02:39:02.357 --> 02:39:04.519]  Same thing Dr. Paul Gregg-Roberts is saying.
[02:39:04.919 --> 02:39:16.326]  And if we've got derivatives, by the way, at over $1,000 trillion, I mean, the banks... It's hard to know how massive the derivatives are, but even with the
[02:39:17.106 --> 02:39:44.445]  Even with the sub-prime collateralized loan obligations from the housing industry, and the collateralized loan obligations from commercial paper, Alex, I think that half of the banks in the United States, including some of the largest ones, like Citibank, if they had to mark these collateralized mortgage obligations as debt obligations, these securities they're holding in their asset portfolio, they wouldn't have the reserves that they need to continue operating.
[02:39:45.171 --> 02:40:00.960]  Half the banks in the United States today, if they had to honestly mark their assets to market with all this junk securities on debt obligations that they're holding, half the banks would have to admit we don't have the capital to keep going.
[02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:02.441]  But subprime is just the beginning.
[02:40:02.481 --> 02:40:11.926]  Now states are demanding tens of billions back because they're finding out that the big brokerage houses and others have sold them supposed AAA corporate paper that's actual trash.
[02:40:12.227 --> 02:40:12.687]  That's correct.
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:15.620]  And it's not just the mortgages.
[02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:26.742]  They did this in the commercial paper market, where the corporations were going to buy and leverage buyouts or leverage purchases of other companies or finances.
[02:40:26.842 --> 02:40:38.764]  They gave AAA paper ratings to junk bonds and corporate bonds that should have been rated junk, because they packaged them together in these securities and Wall Street sold them.
[02:40:38.864 --> 02:40:40.805]  Well, you talk about a bad recession.
[02:40:40.865 --> 02:40:42.425]  This could gyrate into
[02:40:44.188 --> 02:40:46.349]  This could be worse than the depression.
[02:40:46.769 --> 02:40:56.913]  You've got probably three to six trillion dollars of bad, collateralized securities that are held today by banks, pension funds,
[02:40:57.626 --> 02:40:59.507]  Well, it's happening right now.
[02:40:59.527 --> 02:41:07.731]  I mean, when Citibank has to go to Abu Dhabi and get, you know, $7.5 billion to keep in business to promise them an 11% return on that investment and give them a percentage of Citibank in the process,
[02:41:27.551 --> 02:41:35.234]  I mean, this is, I think what they got, 7.5% of Citibank, and Abu Dhabi gave them $20 billion, with some transactions of that nature.
[02:41:35.574 --> 02:41:37.455]  That's a desperation transaction.
[02:41:37.895 --> 02:41:42.537]  That's a, we can't continue in business unless we bring in the petrodollars.
[02:41:43.468 --> 02:41:48.012]  It's selling out the United States to foreign interests because Citibank is broke.
[02:41:48.192 --> 02:41:55.658]  And as you know, big investment firms are coming in and buying that AAA paper now, at the top, at 26 cents on the dollar.
[02:41:55.919 --> 02:41:59.141]  And, you know, you've got funds out there.
[02:41:59.522 --> 02:42:10.751]  Even China, with our massive trade deficit, and all our companies going madly to get Chinese slaves to produce the goods, is an immoral and bad business.
[02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:17.024]  China's now got $1.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, 80% of it's in dollars.
[02:42:17.545 --> 02:42:19.746]  They've announced they don't want to hold so many dollars.
[02:42:19.786 --> 02:42:22.769]  And it's clearly accelerating in the worsening climate.
[02:42:23.129 --> 02:42:27.632]  When do you see it hitting a point where it really descends quickly?
[02:42:28.032 --> 02:42:28.673]  Early next year?
[02:42:28.713 --> 02:42:29.353]  Middle next year?
[02:42:29.373 --> 02:42:30.754]  I think it's happening right now.
[02:42:31.215 --> 02:42:37.419]  The stock market has already twice gone over $14,000 and then started trading down to where it's been under $13,000.
[02:42:37.519 --> 02:42:38.400]  Right now today,
[02:42:39.861 --> 02:42:41.783]  They're trying to buoy up the stock market again.
[02:42:41.803 --> 02:42:43.144]  They're trying to get it to $13,500.
[02:42:43.824 --> 02:42:46.186]  When will confidence be lost and we see a real plunge?
[02:42:46.926 --> 02:43:04.680]  I'd say by the end of this year, two months from now, when increasingly they have to rate their financial reports at the end of the year, when the CEOs have to, under Oxley Sarbanes, fess up to some reality, I expect that the first quarter next year is going to be a very down quarter.
[02:43:05.262 --> 02:43:07.984]  And then it'll be openly admitted that we're in a recession.
[02:43:08.185 --> 02:43:13.810]  What happens when the credit card debt average of $25,000 plus per person comes in?
[02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:21.076]  What happens when all these other leveraged negative securities, you know, where they're loaning out ten times the money off of debts?
[02:43:21.116 --> 02:43:22.717]  I mean, what happens when that... It's a house of cards.
[02:43:22.817 --> 02:43:23.698]  It's going to collapse.
[02:43:24.138 --> 02:43:24.999]  And we're in a dilemma.
[02:43:25.059 --> 02:43:27.782]  Right now, Wall Street, turn on CNBC.
[02:43:27.822 --> 02:43:29.123]  They're begging Wall Street.
[02:43:29.603 --> 02:43:35.207]  You know, Wall Street's begging the Fed to lower the Fed funds rate again.
[02:43:35.868 --> 02:43:37.029]  They've done it twice now.
[02:43:37.189 --> 02:43:41.091]  And now they're putting out, now they're saying... If they do it again, the dollar will further collapse.
[02:43:41.332 --> 02:43:46.335]  And now they're saying, I'm sure you saw the articles this week, now they're claiming cutting interest rates is good for the dollar.
[02:43:46.355 --> 02:43:47.236]  Have you seen that news?
[02:43:47.356 --> 02:43:52.660]  Well, that's just nonsense, because the dollar is at the lowest point it's ever been against the euro.
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:55.802]  The dollar is close to in full collapse.
[02:43:55.962 --> 02:43:56.762]  But that's what I mean.
[02:43:56.842 --> 02:44:03.225]  Why are they now saying things that even laymen know, that cutting interest rates will drive the dollar down, and then they go, no, it's good.
[02:44:03.305 --> 02:44:07.267]  Well, they've come, you know, the government has taken lying as a public policy.
[02:44:07.787 --> 02:44:11.309]  It's like when they report inflation, the Consumer Price Index.
[02:44:11.809 --> 02:44:16.591]  They've taken out energy and food when they report core inflation.
[02:44:17.171 --> 02:44:18.372]  If they were reporting today,
[02:44:19.284 --> 02:44:28.847]  The Consumer Price Index, if the government reported that the way they did in the 1980s, the same formulas, they'd have to be telling people we have 12 to 14 percent inflation right now.
[02:44:29.147 --> 02:44:29.948]  That's conservative.
[02:44:30.248 --> 02:44:30.968]  That's conservative.
[02:44:30.988 --> 02:44:32.929]  I mean, go fill your gas tank.
[02:44:33.409 --> 02:44:42.892]  You know, if it doesn't cost $65 or $75 to get a tank of gas, you know, that's shocking, and that's where we're at, and they're saying we're at zero inflation or 2 percent.
[02:44:42.932 --> 02:44:43.513]  It's a lie.
[02:44:43.893 --> 02:44:44.793]  Let's take some calls.
[02:44:44.873 --> 02:44:47.434]  Leo and Mash, but quickly, you're on the air with Dr. Corsi.
[02:44:48.842 --> 02:44:49.522]  Mr. Corsi?
[02:44:49.802 --> 02:44:50.222]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:51.103 --> 02:44:54.403]  Are you familiar with the background people who run WorldNetDaily?
[02:44:56.904 --> 02:44:57.884]  What do you want to say?
[02:44:57.904 --> 02:45:12.667]  I noticed that they publicized a sort of Zionist type missive, and then I called them on it, and I got no response.
[02:45:13.177 --> 02:45:17.081]  And then I noticed that they have an Israel oil banner on their site.
[02:45:17.221 --> 02:45:20.084]  I don't know where you're going with this.
[02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:22.266]  It sounds like you're anti-Israel.
[02:45:24.007 --> 02:45:26.149]  I think they're Zionists and you don't realize it.
[02:45:26.169 --> 02:45:26.630]  Okay, I heard you.
[02:45:26.670 --> 02:45:27.491]  Thank you very much.
[02:45:27.511 --> 02:45:28.431]  I appreciate your comment.
[02:45:28.512 --> 02:45:37.420]  Yeah, Leo, listen, I asked politely at the start of the interview, not because I thought somebody like you would call in, but I want to talk about the North American Union, the economy, the state of the country.
[02:45:38.138 --> 02:45:43.420]  Okay, and you know, Dr. Corsi writes for Human Events, World Net Daily, a bunch of other stuff.
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:44.501]  He's writing about this.
[02:45:44.541 --> 02:45:45.541]  We've got him on about that.
[02:45:45.901 --> 02:45:51.404]  You can get 20 different flavors on World Net Daily, and it just does nothing to sit here and do that, okay?
[02:45:51.544 --> 02:45:53.645]  Joe in Chicago, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:45:55.239 --> 02:45:55.819]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:45:56.099 --> 02:45:56.319]  Yes.
[02:45:56.499 --> 02:45:57.640]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:01.260]  I was going to say, Dr. Corsi already brought him up.
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:03.921]  It was the disc jockey, Michael Medvick.
[02:46:04.341 --> 02:46:09.682]  I've listened to his show a few times to get the other side of what their propaganda is being spread.
[02:46:10.163 --> 02:46:15.864]  He mentioned that he would give up his show for a day if someone could come on and prove there was
[02:46:17.129 --> 02:46:19.451]  Uh, effort to form a North American Union.
[02:46:19.491 --> 02:46:22.294]  But see, but see, that's a, that's a huckster scam.
[02:46:22.314 --> 02:46:24.075]  You know, money back guarantee, whatever.
[02:46:24.876 --> 02:46:32.122]  That's a scam where he just acts like no one can disprove it, and then he'll just say they haven't proven it satisfactorily to him.
[02:46:32.142 --> 02:46:32.782]  Dr. Gorsy?
[02:46:32.903 --> 02:46:35.425]  He won't schedule me as a guest on that show.
[02:46:35.905 --> 02:46:38.888]  He says if I want to call in, I can call in like anybody else.
[02:46:38.928 --> 02:46:41.470]  Well, I'm not going to call in when he can unplug it.
[02:46:41.490 --> 02:46:45.033]  If he wants to schedule me as a guest, I'm scheduled on hundreds of radio shows.
[02:46:45.672 --> 02:46:47.954]  He won't directly argue the issue.
[02:46:48.695 --> 02:46:58.463]  He wants to name-call and go into rants and raves, and my answer to that is, you know, there's doctors who can handle that problem if he's got, you know, anger control or emotional problems.
[02:46:58.483 --> 02:46:58.963]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:46:58.983 --> 02:46:59.664]  Here's the deal.
[02:46:59.704 --> 02:47:09.412]  That Twit Medved is a hack for the White House and the neocons, and he can just continue to say it doesn't exist when the base of his audience knows it does.
[02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:10.733]  I mean, he's only hurting himself, Doctor.
[02:47:11.272 --> 02:47:17.714]  Well, you know, it's pathetic to have to engage in such name-calling in order to advance an argument.
[02:47:18.374 --> 02:47:25.376]  I'm saying there are issues here, there's facts, there's evidence, and I'm happy to discuss the evidence on an honest basis.
[02:47:25.537 --> 02:47:33.199]  That's what Michael Medved will not do anymore than George Bush will do, and the American people are looking at the footnotes
[02:47:33.780 --> 02:47:39.603]  You know, in late great USA, they're going to the government website and they're believing their own lying eyes.
[02:47:39.703 --> 02:47:39.923]  Sure.
[02:47:40.023 --> 02:47:41.883]  Anything else, Joe?
[02:47:41.984 --> 02:47:43.544]  I just would agree with the doctor.
[02:47:43.964 --> 02:47:45.785]  He just said that Michael does go into rants.
[02:47:45.805 --> 02:47:47.046]  He does go into name-calling.
[02:47:47.406 --> 02:47:52.788]  He actually now has gotten down to where he's mentioned you, Alex, and he's played the trailer to Endgame for you.
[02:47:53.128 --> 02:47:54.729]  So we are getting your name through him.
[02:47:55.129 --> 02:47:56.250]  What did he say about Endgame?
[02:48:09.665 --> 02:48:11.847]  What a kook you are, I guess.
[02:48:13.368 --> 02:48:16.070]  You're predicting the end of the time, so to speak.
[02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:17.211]  No, that's not what I'm doing.
[02:48:17.251 --> 02:48:25.257]  I'm saying the people running the UN and running these globalist organizations openly in all their documents say they want to forcibly reduce world population by 80%.
[02:48:26.340 --> 02:48:33.486]  Well, he's probably not 90 or some BS, but... But see, everybody knows about Dr. Bianca and Peter Singer and all these people.
[02:48:33.766 --> 02:48:35.508]  Well, as you say, he don't want to face the truth.
[02:48:35.888 --> 02:48:41.753]  And also, real quick, I think people should check out the website of staff of the North American Union if they get a chance.
[02:48:41.853 --> 02:48:42.934]  Sure, sure.
[02:48:43.014 --> 02:48:44.055]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:48:44.075 --> 02:48:45.516]  Dr. Corsi.
[02:48:46.597 --> 02:48:47.998]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:48.018 --> 02:48:50.120]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:55.244]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[02:49:01.326 --> 02:49:03.768]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.508 --> 02:49:11.833]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.835 --> 02:49:19.818]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.319 --> 02:49:23.781]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.161 --> 02:49:26.683]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.743 --> 02:49:27.884]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.904 --> 02:49:28.664]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.684 --> 02:49:29.745]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.965 --> 02:49:30.385]  They're after policy.
[02:49:30.405 --> 02:49:31.966]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[02:49:32.087 --> 02:49:36.650]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:49:36.850 --> 02:49:40.292]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:40.452 --> 02:49:43.434]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:49:43.614 --> 02:49:44.635]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.495 --> 02:49:50.477]  We all know that Berkey water systems are the only trusted name in water filtration available on the market.
[02:49:50.637 --> 02:50:06.021]  The revolutionary Berkey Light self-sterilizing and recleanable purification elements purify water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels and by extracting harmful chemicals such as herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, and radon-222.
[02:50:06.241 --> 02:50:10.782]  They also reduce nitrates, nitrites, sediment, and unhealthy minerals such as lead and mercury.
[02:50:11.042 --> 02:50:19.707]  As an authorized dealer for over two and a half years serving thousands of satisfied customers, we offer the best deal in the world on the web for Berkey Light water systems.
[02:50:19.887 --> 02:50:26.071]  Order the Berkey Light system today and we'll include two black Berkey elements and three sport Berkey water bottles for only $209 with free shipping.
[02:50:26.111 --> 02:50:26.671]  That's right!
[02:50:27.892 --> 02:50:28.913]  Hi Ken, it's Judy again.
[02:50:28.933 --> 02:50:32.216]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:50:51.553 --> 02:50:54.695]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:50:54.915 --> 02:50:56.796]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:50:57.076 --> 02:50:59.157]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:50:59.338 --> 02:51:05.441]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:51:05.641 --> 02:51:10.944]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:51:11.205 --> 02:51:14.046]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:51:14.186 --> 02:51:15.107]  Go KenSolar!
[02:51:16.408 --> 02:51:17.929]  Get the best of both worlds.

[02:51:39.704 --> 02:51:44.087]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[02:51:51.378 --> 02:51:54.139]  A listener mailed in Bloomberg Markets.
[02:51:54.159 --> 02:51:55.380]  This just came in in the mail.
[02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:58.421]  And it says, the rise of carbon capitalism.
[02:51:58.441 --> 02:51:59.501]  It's not capitalism.
[02:52:00.262 --> 02:52:05.924]  Inside the new economy of global warming and how much money you can make off all the new taxes in the U.S.
[02:52:05.984 --> 02:52:09.105]  But there's no plan for any carbon taxes.
[02:52:10.005 --> 02:52:11.446]  There's no such thing.
[02:52:11.666 --> 02:52:12.966]  It's just all over the news.
[02:52:15.658 --> 02:52:17.539]  These people, hey, it's coming to an end.
[02:52:17.579 --> 02:52:24.164]  People know who you are now, you scumbag Schwarzenegger, scumbag Bloomberg, Hillary, Bush, all of them.
[02:52:24.204 --> 02:52:25.465]  You're New World Order trash.
[02:52:26.305 --> 02:52:33.330]  Jared in Wisconsin, you're on the air with the author of The Late Great USA, available at InfoWars.com discounted right now.
[02:52:33.871 --> 02:52:37.913]  And I hope you will get it, because I want to win this war, and that book is pure documentation.
[02:52:38.334 --> 02:52:39.735]  Jared, you're on the air with Dr. Corsi.
[02:52:39.755 --> 02:52:40.615]  Go ahead, quickly, please.
[02:52:41.075 --> 02:52:44.718]  Well, I thought I'd mention about their, uh, is that, uh,
[02:52:45.202 --> 02:52:54.647]  There was a presidential debate back in September, didn't get a lot of media coverage, a value voter debate, where none of the frontrunners were there, all the second tier people were there, Huckabee and them?
[02:52:55.108 --> 02:52:55.428]  Yes.
[02:52:56.008 --> 02:53:02.932]  And they asked a question about the North American Union there, and they all answered it, and all of them were aware of it and said they opposed it.
[02:53:03.552 --> 02:53:07.895]  Yet in that mainstream CNN debate, they tried to make Ron Paul look like a lone nut
[02:53:08.536 --> 02:53:10.877]  Like the only one who would even think something that crazy.
[02:53:11.077 --> 02:53:12.818]  It just shows how bankrupt they are.
[02:53:12.858 --> 02:53:14.119]  Thanks for the call, Dr. Corsi.
[02:53:14.219 --> 02:53:25.004]  And that question was asked by Phyllis Schlafly, who is an extremely prominent, well-respected conservative, who for decades has led conservative causes.
[02:53:25.345 --> 02:53:30.187]  And Phyllis Schlafly asked the question at the value debate about the North American Union.
[02:53:30.207 --> 02:53:33.889]  And Ron Paul, by the way, was there as in the CNN debate.
[02:53:34.509 --> 02:53:35.430]  Equally strong.
[02:53:36.231 --> 02:53:40.955]  I think the attempt to ridicule just shows that the damage is being done, and the word is getting out.
[02:53:41.575 --> 02:53:48.301]  And now, what the White House wants to do is kind of put the lid on this by ridiculing it, but it doesn't answer the question.
[02:53:48.401 --> 02:53:54.547]  It doesn't refute the government website, and it doesn't stop the North American integration that's going on.
[02:53:54.607 --> 02:54:01.333]  I mean, we've twice now blocked the shamnesty bill from going through the Senate, but yet the border's still wide open.
[02:54:01.952 --> 02:54:03.634]  Yeah, what I don't understand is, you know
[02:54:21.218 --> 02:54:21.799]  It's crazy.
[02:54:21.819 --> 02:54:25.182]  So, I mean, what can we do on the grassroots level?
[02:54:25.242 --> 02:54:26.463]  Run for County Commissioner.
[02:54:26.523 --> 02:54:27.524]  Run for City Council.
[02:54:27.844 --> 02:54:30.126]  Give them Dr. Corsi's late great USA.
[02:54:30.326 --> 02:54:33.269]  Educate movers and shakers in your area.
[02:54:33.309 --> 02:54:35.731]  That's better than educating a thousand other folks.
[02:54:36.292 --> 02:54:37.153]  Do you agree, Corsi?
[02:54:37.333 --> 02:54:37.913]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:54:37.933 --> 02:54:40.356]  I think you've got to work at the grassroots level.
[02:54:40.396 --> 02:54:42.277]  Go to your city councils.
[02:54:42.317 --> 02:54:43.859]  Talk to your state legislators.
[02:54:44.551 --> 02:54:49.373]  I'll help them get a resolution in the state to block the North American Union and adapt to superhighways.
[02:54:49.473 --> 02:54:50.534]  I'm going to jam one more in.
[02:54:50.594 --> 02:54:51.254]  Fred in Philly.
[02:54:51.294 --> 02:54:51.855]  Last caller.
[02:54:51.875 --> 02:54:52.315]  Go ahead.
[02:54:53.275 --> 02:55:01.159]  Dr. Corsi, did you say that you weren't able to get the organizational chart or you're going to get it?
[02:55:01.419 --> 02:55:02.920]  No, we have the organizational chart.
[02:55:02.940 --> 02:55:03.880]  It's in Endgame.
[02:55:04.120 --> 02:55:05.421]  It's in Late Great USA.
[02:55:05.941 --> 02:55:12.444]  I think another thing you can do, and I've been doing it, is I've been confronting Department of Commerce executives.
[02:55:14.564 --> 02:55:17.206]  Have you heard of Gerri C. Ward?
[02:55:17.626 --> 02:55:25.091]  Yes, she is the Department of Commerce Administrator who's in charge of the SPP working groups.
[02:55:26.212 --> 02:55:28.993]  She's the Chief on coordinating the information.
[02:55:29.634 --> 02:55:37.639]  I asked someone at the Department of Commerce, who's got a Korean name, I don't have it in front of me, what is the legal authority for SPP and she had
[02:55:39.815 --> 02:55:43.096]  She basically spent 10 minutes evading that answer.
[02:55:43.176 --> 02:55:46.737]  Pepper them with those and don't take their nonsense for answers.
[02:55:46.818 --> 02:55:48.378]  Make them answer the questions you ask.
[02:55:48.438 --> 02:55:50.119]  Yeah, call them, email them.
[02:55:50.239 --> 02:55:51.579]  Call them when they're on talk shows.
[02:55:51.619 --> 02:55:52.760]  Call into other talk shows.
[02:55:52.820 --> 02:55:54.440]  Make a lot of noise and never stop.
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:55:58.262]  We don't have any chance if you don't, ladies and gentlemen, and we've got the initiative.
[02:55:58.462 --> 02:56:00.342]  Dr. Corsi, I want to thank you for coming on with us.
[02:56:00.522 --> 02:56:01.623]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[02:56:01.723 --> 02:56:02.143]  Anytime.
[02:56:02.828 --> 02:56:07.533]  Late Great USA, ladies and gentlemen, available right now at InfoWars.com, discounted.

[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:15.680]  Get it!
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:16.941]  Get it out to people!
[02:56:17.001 --> 02:56:18.002]  That's the goal here.
