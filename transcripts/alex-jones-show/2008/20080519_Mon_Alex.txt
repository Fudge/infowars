[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.509]  We're good to go.
[00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:36.370]  And we are going to be opening the phones up in the next hour and 30 minutes.
[00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:41.453]  We're going to have We Are Change Ohio and We Are Change Kentucky on.
[00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:47.117]  They went in, they had official press passes, they asked Oliver North about the concentration camp program.
[00:00:47.877 --> 00:00:52.860]  And they, when they were walking out, jumped on one guy from behind, grabbed his camera, tackled him.
[00:00:53.712 --> 00:01:02.516]  And then said, we're going to charge you with felonies for withholding evidence because you somehow having memory chips in their cameras was withholding evidence.
[00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:10.099]  So they stole the memory chips, stole the batteries, took them outside, screamed at them for 45 minutes like drill sergeants.
[00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.760]  I mean, this is a press being attacked, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:18.202]  I got so mad about it yesterday on air when we had Adam
[00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:20.336]  On from We Are Change Kentucky.
[00:01:20.376 --> 00:01:21.857]  I want to get him on and the other guys.
[00:01:21.877 --> 00:01:23.018]  We've been able to get a hold of Adam.
[00:01:23.438 --> 00:01:24.739]  I have the numbers for the other guys.
[00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.782]  Guys, if you're out there, call into the network because I'm trying.
[00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:31.443]  I want to get you guys on for the last 30 minutes of the show.
[00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:35.386]  We've got Adam coming on, but I heard him last night after I interviewed Adam.
[00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:38.768]  I heard him on another show and I was driving around in the car and it was unbelievable.
[00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:40.229]  It was even worse than what Adam was saying.
[00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.114]  And it was very credible how they were telling their story and there's photos of them up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:48.610]  All tore up.
[00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.691]  9-11 blogger has it too.
[00:01:51.532 --> 00:01:52.212]  Cut from it.
[00:01:53.353 --> 00:01:54.674]  And what they did.
[00:01:54.774 --> 00:01:57.676]  And Oliver North posing as a conservative.
[00:01:58.497 --> 00:01:59.677]  These people make me sick.
[00:02:00.678 --> 00:02:03.240]  They really make me sick.
[00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.443]  WeAreChange assaulted by police in Louisville.
[00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:09.884]  Oliver North confronted.
[00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:11.305]  Video footage confiscated.
[00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:13.347]  Members of WeAreChange.org actually has the story.
[00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:22.217]  We're physically removed from Louisville Exposition Center on Sunday after confronting Iran contrafigure Oliver North.
[00:02:22.617 --> 00:02:29.583]  Members questioned North on his involvement with Continental government in the new 9-11 investigation and concealment camps in America.
[00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:36.969]  Lieutenant Oliver North, a Fox News host, was confronted by a combination of actors from We Are Change Ohio, Kentucky Change.
[00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.333]  Cody Deeds stood up during the question and answer session and asked him about
[00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:42.903]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:43.524]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:03:05.387 --> 00:03:07.048]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:10.789]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.790]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.151]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:21.933]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:03:22.193 --> 00:03:26.114]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:31.336]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:34.397]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[00:03:34.677 --> 00:03:41.519]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.121]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video.
[00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:12.557]  We're going to be talking to We Are Change Kentucky, We Are Change Ohio.
[00:04:12.577 --> 00:04:19.722]  Later in this hour, they were assaulted by private security guns and police at the NRA convention in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.424]  They peacefully went to the event.
[00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:24.425]  They had accredited press passes they got.
[00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:30.549]  When they asked Oliver North about continuity of government, I'm going to play some of that video later, came out in Congress.
[00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.673]  Their plan to put Americans in concentration camps, which is now mainstream news, repackaged, brought out.
[00:04:36.013 --> 00:04:37.194]  More news on that today.
[00:04:38.114 --> 00:05:01.495]  They told them to leave, and as they were leaving, they tackled one guy in the back and stole their camera equipment, stole their digital recording chips, and then threatened to charge them all with felonies, saying that something about having computer chips and cameras was absconding with federal evidence, and they were all going to prison for the rest of their lives, and then they just screamed at them and laughed at them for 45 minutes.
[00:05:02.876 --> 00:05:09.265]  And that's what our country's turned into, just a land of humiliation, a land of cowardice, a land of degeneracy.
[00:05:09.286 --> 00:05:14.393]  I have another big story here out of the New York Times today.
[00:05:15.538 --> 00:05:23.665]  And I want to spend more time on this and take your calls on this issue and on some other issues as well.
[00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:34.414]  And this just says that people turn in their children, grandchildren, parents for money, the most petty of crimes, marijuana, you name it, and they just call up wanting $100, $500.
[00:05:34.474 --> 00:05:38.137]  They say, you know, my son's smoking pot, I need $500.
[00:05:38.618 --> 00:05:39.959]  And they go, alright, we're coming.
[00:05:41.027 --> 00:05:41.988]  And it says it's good.
[00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:45.551]  The article's about how good this is and how the people are finally being good Americans.
[00:05:46.752 --> 00:05:47.993]  And you can't make this up.
[00:05:48.373 --> 00:05:49.153]  You can't make up.
[00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:52.516]  We are the most slovenly, degenerate, wicked people on earth.
[00:05:53.277 --> 00:05:54.238]  Now a lot of us are good.
[00:05:54.278 --> 00:05:55.458]  I'm saying by and large.
[00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:03.625]  It's like you have a barrel of apples and, you know, 60% of the apples are filled with worms and there's a bunch of cow manure dumped on top of it.
[00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.267]  And then a bucket of ticks.
[00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:08.209]  You don't eat apples out of any of that.
[00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.730]  I mean, are there 40% good apples?
[00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:16.194]  Yes, but the worms are now eating into those and soon there won't be any apples left.
[00:06:16.274 --> 00:06:18.796]  It'll just be a big mush of worms and ticks.
[00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:20.758]  I mean, that's really what we are.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:41.904]  And it's a country where cowards like Oliver North that hate this country and helped ship in narcotics, as the CIA's own Solicitor General reported to Congress, and who helped run death squads, is hailed as a conservative, as his conservative god, George Bush, opens the border, triples the size of the BATF, destroys the dollar, destroys our name.
[00:06:41.924 --> 00:06:45.845]  And of course, Oliver North is nothing but a complete coward and a puppet and a fake conservative.
[00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:49.726]  I mean, he's not even worth a mention, other than the fact that he had his goons
[00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:52.287]  Violate the First Amendment rights of U.S.
[00:06:52.307 --> 00:06:52.747]  citizens.
[00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:56.728]  And it's one thing to do that in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Colombia.
[00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.229]  It's another thing to do that in the U.S.
[00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:07.192]  And now they have Mexican cartels run by the CIA, murdering police in the U.S., murdering the other drug cartels that haven't paid their cuts.
[00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:11.073]  As the people that run our government, the Criminal and Crime Syndicate consolidates its power.
[00:07:11.093 --> 00:07:12.234]  Our government's running these hits.
[00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:14.970]  And running these operations.
[00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:17.192]  And I'm just tired of it.
[00:07:17.613 --> 00:07:17.993]  I'm tired.
[00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:18.974]  I mean, look, it's simple.
[00:07:19.454 --> 00:07:21.256]  The big banks that own our country
[00:07:24.173 --> 00:07:26.956]  They decided, why don't we just take over the U.S.?
[00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:27.857]  Why don't we just run it?
[00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:31.380]  Why don't we triple charge people for their water and triple charge for their trash pickup?
[00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:34.443]  Why don't we arrest people and give them ten years in prison for speeding now?
[00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:36.485]  Or arrest you for not having a seatbelt?
[00:07:36.566 --> 00:07:39.008]  Or arrest you for not having a turn signal on?
[00:07:39.128 --> 00:07:42.031]  Or why don't we train your children to tattle on you?
[00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:44.313]  Or why don't we just take everything over?
[00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:46.636]  And they said, okay, let's do it.
[00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:48.383]  And they've done it.
[00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:51.864]  And they bring the drugs in and they put your young people in prison making widgets.
[00:07:52.404 --> 00:07:55.204]  And then the idiot population says, oh, make them prisoners work.
[00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:55.764]  They're lazy.
[00:07:56.125 --> 00:08:00.325]  What you don't know is, is that those prisoners then compete against you.
[00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:04.006]  Those prisoners then take your jobs.
[00:08:04.926 --> 00:08:06.366]  Because they're working for 20 cents an hour.
[00:08:06.426 --> 00:08:07.586]  How are you going to compete with that?
[00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.507]  The illegal will work for 5 bucks an hour.
[00:08:09.827 --> 00:08:11.707]  The prisoner works for 20 cents an hour on average.
[00:08:12.087 --> 00:08:13.167]  What's going to happen to your job?
[00:08:13.187 --> 00:08:14.268]  What's going to happen to your economy?
[00:08:14.608 --> 00:08:15.708]  What's going to happen to your country?
[00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:24.435]  But up on WeAreChange.org and InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, you can look at the story, We Are Change Assaulted by Police in Louisville.
[00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:28.576]  And it just lets you know, another nail in the coffin as the U.S.
[00:08:29.237 --> 00:08:36.539]  sinks under the ocean of third world despotism and becomes a banana boat republic with a hyper-techno police state overlay.
[00:08:36.939 --> 00:08:38.639]  Couldn't be a worse thing happen.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.001]  It is a big idea.
[00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:43.941]  Okay, Jones?
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:46.760]  Yeah, he stopped.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.061]  What's going to happen to your country?
[00:08:49.182 --> 00:09:00.867]  But up on WeAreChange.org and InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com you can look at the story WeAreChange assaulted by police in Louisville and it just lets you know another nail in the coffin as the U.S.
[00:09:01.548 --> 00:09:08.832]  sinks under the ocean of third world despotism and becomes a banana boat republic with a hyper-techno police state overlay.
[00:09:09.232 --> 00:09:10.913]  Couldn't be a worse thing happening.
[00:09:13.934 --> 00:09:15.255]  It is a big idea
[00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.472]  A New World Order.
[00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:22.214]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:09:22.314 --> 00:09:25.856]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:28.137]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:09:28.677 --> 00:09:31.119]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:39.183]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:47.171]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:09:47.652 --> 00:09:51.114]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:09:51.514 --> 00:09:53.996]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:55.237]  Most people have no idea.
[00:09:55.257 --> 00:09:56.017]  They're not after money.
[00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:57.118]  They have all the money they need.
[00:09:57.318 --> 00:09:57.899]  They're after power.
[00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:58.979]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:00.975]  We are Change, Ohio!
[00:12:06.289 --> 00:12:13.285]  Had press passes, were accredited, got up during the question and answer for Oliver North, and asked about continuity of government.
[00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:16.154]  They asked politely.
[00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:18.896]  It's been reported by three of them we've talked to.
[00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:24.039]  And then they were followed because, you know, imagine all these cops are trained to fight terror.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:31.805]  They've been taught in all their manuals and training that anybody that talks about FEMA camps or martial law, you know they're being trained for it, is a terrorist.
[00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:39.071]  And so they tackle them, grab the cameras, freak out, talk about how they're going to set them up, how they're going in for felonies, for videotaping stuff.
[00:12:39.931 --> 00:12:40.392]  I mean, you know,
[00:12:41.072 --> 00:12:46.753]  There's no real terrorists, but they all watch 24 and think they're Jack Bauer, so the press is now Al Qaeda.
[00:12:47.153 --> 00:12:49.814]  It's like they'll kill you in Mexico if you report on government drug dealing.
[00:12:50.254 --> 00:12:52.575]  They're starting to kill reporters here and kill cops here.
[00:12:53.055 --> 00:12:57.716]  AP reports, they've told our cops, work for us or you die, and our cops are saying, we work for you!
[00:12:58.396 --> 00:13:00.377]  It's a nation run by fear and cowardice.
[00:13:01.097 --> 00:13:05.638]  And the death squads are run by the CIA, and they, as we told you three years ago, and it's now mainstream news.
[00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:13.561]  The media acts like, oh, the death squads are government trained, they're now operating in Texas and Indiana and all, they're killing people.
[00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:15.861]  Oh my God, our government doesn't control them.
[00:13:16.101 --> 00:13:17.942]  They trained them and now they're out of control.
[00:13:18.682 --> 00:13:19.862]  They've always controlled them.
[00:13:20.482 --> 00:13:22.723]  And now it's time for us to be third world slaves.
[00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:31.745]  But I thought I would go ahead and go to the document cam so I can show people
[00:13:34.855 --> 00:13:35.776]  What's going on here?
[00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:38.818]  I was going to show them a video, but I don't even have my controller in here.
[00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:40.459]  I gotta get that switcher in here.
[00:13:40.499 --> 00:13:41.159]  This isn't working.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.821]  I don't know where the controller is.
[00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:46.983]  I wanted to show people this video for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers that are out there.
[00:13:48.064 --> 00:13:49.325]  And I don't have that little switcher.
[00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:50.046]  Oh, here it is.
[00:13:51.427 --> 00:13:53.468]  Why should I even show people this stuff with North?
[00:13:53.488 --> 00:13:54.269]  They don't even care.
[00:13:54.409 --> 00:13:54.869]  Just don't.
[00:13:54.929 --> 00:13:56.370]  Look, you're all going to get it, okay?
[00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.991]  All of you that like the system.
[00:13:58.051 --> 00:13:59.212]  All of you that think it's real funny.
[00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:03.055]  Here's the video of it from my film, Police Day 2, The Takeover.
[00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:04.379]  Okay.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:05.980]  Here it is.
[00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:17.607]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC, were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[00:14:18.247 --> 00:14:32.655]  Mr. Chairman, I believe the question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area, so may I request that you not touch upon that, sir.
[00:14:34.202 --> 00:14:55.557]  I was particularly concerned, Chairman, because I read in Miami Papers and several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution.
[00:14:55.657 --> 00:15:00.240]  And I was deeply concerned about it and wondered if that was the area in which he had worked.
[00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:08.164]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[00:15:09.025 --> 00:15:13.389]  If we wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[00:15:14.822 --> 00:15:18.504]  And tragically, the only member who got close was Jack Brooks.
[00:15:19.144 --> 00:15:20.545]  And he was stopped by the Chairman.
[00:15:21.165 --> 00:15:24.727]  But the truth of the matter is that, yes, you do have those standby provisions.
[00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:26.348]  And the plans are there.
[00:15:26.528 --> 00:15:44.197]  And the statutory, uh, emergency plans are there, whereby, uh, you could, in the name of, uh, stopping terrorism, apprehend, invoke the military, and, uh, arrest Americans and hold them in detention camps.
[00:15:46.657 --> 00:15:56.321]  Okay, you can just type in Oliver North, FEMA Camps, and look, if I sound mad on air, I'm not mad at the people to network or anybody here, I'm mad.
[00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:59.543]  I mean, it makes me sick looking at Oliver North.
[00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:07.226]  I mean, this fake American, this fake Marine, this fake patriot, all they're doing is killing the country.
[00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.873]  Something Hitler couldn't do, something Stalin couldn't do, something Mao couldn't do.
[00:16:12.533 --> 00:16:15.816]  And they wrap themselves in the flag while they do it.
[00:16:16.537 --> 00:16:23.342]  They scientifically manipulate you and have these things like war stories and associate themselves with Audie Murphy and other heroes.
[00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.064]  It's disgusting.
[00:16:26.604 --> 00:16:29.666]  It's disgusting to watch them get away with this over and over again.
[00:16:30.687 --> 00:16:33.129]  And they're just taking the whole country, they're taking the whole thing down.
[00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:52.803]  I mean, this tore my guts out this morning, when I read this story out of the New York Times, where they're just happily reporting
[00:16:54.465 --> 00:16:58.069]  That's up on the document cam for folks that are watching online right now.
[00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:04.095]  As prices rise, crime tipsters work overtime.
[00:17:04.135 --> 00:17:05.837]  That's right, that's their job it says.
[00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:10.482]  And yeah, I mean I told the story just last week about
[00:17:12.094 --> 00:17:28.492]  One of the famous cases, and I always use cases that are well known, there's literally thousands I've seen until I see it now in a newspaper and I get sad, I get upset, I get anxious, my heart starts beating because I want justice to be done, I want bad guys to go to jail, I can't believe we're in this much trouble.
[00:17:29.012 --> 00:17:32.356]  It's like we're just going deeper and deeper down a black hole I know we're not coming out of.
[00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:59.603]  About the guy in North Carolina that owned a couple of nurseries for plants, and every year he went to Texas to Houston to buy Yopons that were going to be shipped by 18 Wheeler, but they gave him a discount if he paid cash, and he had $14,000, and he happened to whip some cash out to pay at the airport, and the woman it said was making 30-something grand a year, but she made $200,000 a year in getting a percentage of the seizures.
[00:17:59.823 --> 00:18:02.005]  No drugs found, no criminal record, and they just took his money.
[00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:06.424]  He never got it back and the courts just said it doesn't matter if he doesn't have drugs.
[00:18:07.268 --> 00:18:07.870]  We're going to take it.
[00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:09.750]  And they don't stop, folks.
[00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:21.678]  I mean, there's famous cases of the DPS in Texas pulling over an 80-something-year-old woman who carried around $4,000 cash with her, as most old-time women would carry a lot of money around with them back from the Depression days.
[00:18:22.138 --> 00:18:25.540]  Turned out she was heiress of some oil baron, hundreds of millions of it.
[00:18:25.901 --> 00:18:28.322]  They pull her over, brand new Cadillac, come over to her car.
[00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:30.063]  They say, mind if we search?
[00:18:30.103 --> 00:18:31.384]  She says, okay, officer.
[00:18:31.804 --> 00:18:34.806]  They get the, what, three, four grand in her wallet, and they just take it.
[00:18:34.826 --> 00:18:36.488]  I mean, that's what America is, folks.
[00:18:36.908 --> 00:18:37.468]  They'll come in.
[00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:45.658]  All the time when they raid people for guns that aren't even illegal, they go ahead and take your gold, bust it in your safe, they just put it right in their pockets, right in front of you.
[00:18:48.762 --> 00:18:49.803]  And it's admitted.
[00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:54.449]  I mean, I can sit here for a thousand hours reading mainstream news articles about police
[00:18:55.538 --> 00:19:03.483]  Selling each other drugs to seize bars and restaurants that they then own and run, or stealing people's houses, planting drugs on them, or stealing your land and killing you.
[00:19:03.964 --> 00:19:09.487]  Hell, a lot of times, if they decide they want your ranch, they'll just, cops will come right out and kill you and then use it as their deer hunting ranch.
[00:19:09.527 --> 00:19:14.691]  I mean, they'll just walk you out back and line you up and boom, blow the back of your head right off.
[00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:18.934]  And I mean, you know, I mean, it's the most criminal group there is out there.
[00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.711]  Now, that's the higher-up cops in certain corrupt divisions.
[00:19:23.391 --> 00:19:28.092]  The average cop's just out writing tickets and following orders, and they're not corrupt.
[00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:34.393]  And they're just out raising money and writing tickets to hire more cops.
[00:19:35.373 --> 00:19:36.553]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:37.433]  I mean, I really can't.
[00:19:38.814 --> 00:19:39.794]  I want to take your calls.
[00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:45.835]  I know I've got a bunch of you that are holding John and Chris and Mark and a bunch of other people.
[00:19:48.115 --> 00:19:49.596]  Is this land of the free, home of the brave?
[00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:51.638]  I mean, is this what our country's all about?
[00:19:52.218 --> 00:19:54.921]  As prices rise, crime tipsters work overtime.
[00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:07.351]  To gas prices, foreclosure rates, and the cost of rice, add this rising cost indicator, the number of tips to the police from people hoping to collect reward money.
[00:20:08.888 --> 00:20:15.551]  Calls to the Southwest Florida Crime Stoppers Hotline in the first quarter of the year were up 30% over last year.
[00:20:15.611 --> 00:20:17.651]  San Antonio had a 44% increase.
[00:20:18.071 --> 00:20:32.097]  Cities and towns from Detroit to Omaha to Beaufort, North Carolina all report increases of 25% or more in the first quarter with tipsters telling operators they need the money for rent, light bills and baby formula.
[00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:34.447]  Biggest part of our economy is prisons.
[00:20:34.948 --> 00:20:36.008]  After that, it's military.
[00:20:36.508 --> 00:20:37.588]  After that, it's surveillance.
[00:20:37.608 --> 00:20:38.828]  I mean, that's what we are.
[00:20:39.349 --> 00:20:45.270]  We are the most evil, wicked, pathetic, degenerate, scum-filled nation of trash.
[00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.431]  And I'm not even talking about the police and the government.
[00:20:48.451 --> 00:20:52.712]  I mean, the general public are just mindless, gibbering monkeys.
[00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:53.572]  And let me tell you something.
[00:20:53.952 --> 00:21:01.414]  They set off nukes and then tell the gibbering population to put Americans in camps and that they'll get their milk and honey back, they'll do it.
[00:21:02.324 --> 00:21:11.350]  If you don't think that the Great Depression, 90% of us, or 85, lived on farms and could feed ourselves, and thousands starved, millions went hungry.
[00:21:12.211 --> 00:21:14.833]  Right now, 5% can take care of themselves.
[00:21:15.013 --> 00:21:18.816]  They're going to be demonic animals like you've never seen.
[00:21:18.836 --> 00:21:20.076]  Okay?
[00:21:22.278 --> 00:21:23.739]  Oh God, oh God, roving.
[00:21:23.939 --> 00:21:26.141]  We're going to make Mexico look like heaven, this country.
[00:21:28.106 --> 00:21:32.032]  If you're not going to fight, if you're not going to stay and fight for the country and try to turn it around, you should evacuate.
[00:21:32.473 --> 00:21:36.539]  Not that other countries are good, it's just that this is the land of scum.
[00:21:38.423 --> 00:21:45.146]  Continuing, calls to the Southwest Crime Stoppers hotline in the first quarter, went up 30%, I already read that.
[00:21:46.047 --> 00:21:50.449]  For this year, everyone that's called has pretty much been looking for money, said Sgt.
[00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:59.653]  Lawrence Beller, who answers Crime Stoppers calls, he means snitch, Soviet, Death of America systems, at the Sussex County, New Jersey Sheriff's Office.
[00:22:00.213 --> 00:22:06.616]  That's as opposed to the last couple of years where people were just sick of crime and wanted to do something about it.
[00:22:07.481 --> 00:22:19.645]  As a result, many programs report a substantial increase in crime-stopper-related arrest and recovering property as callers turn in their neighbors, grandchildren, and former boyfriends in exchange for a little cash.
[00:22:22.866 --> 00:22:23.946]  See, their instinct's gone.
[00:22:23.966 --> 00:22:25.426]  It's not that I'm even that good of a person.
[00:22:26.027 --> 00:22:28.647]  I don't tattle on people because I know it's a crime.
[00:22:29.168 --> 00:22:30.008]  I know it's wicked.
[00:22:30.088 --> 00:22:33.469]  I know it contributes to a tattletale scum society.
[00:22:34.488 --> 00:22:37.089]  I mean, it's not even training that makes me never tattle on anybody.
[00:22:37.269 --> 00:22:38.189]  I can't do it.
[00:22:39.769 --> 00:22:46.671]  I mean, I would physically put a mask on and beat somebody over the head with a baseball bat before I'd call Johnny Law to do something to him, and I'm not that I would do that, but you know what I mean.
[00:22:47.311 --> 00:22:48.411]  I mean, I'll do it myself.
[00:22:49.371 --> 00:22:58.553]  On Friday, a woman called the regional Crimestoppers line in Macon, Georgia, to find out when she could pick up her reward money for a recent tip.
[00:22:58.613 --> 00:23:01.434]  She was irritated to learn that she would have to wait until Monday.
[00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:05.341]  See, the government loves to train you to do this.
[00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:09.667]  I mean, it's one thing to let people call and tattle, but you should never get rewards.
[00:23:10.248 --> 00:23:13.252]  See, it started for bank robbers and killers, and ooh, very rare.
[00:23:13.272 --> 00:23:14.133]  Now it's for everything.
[00:23:14.794 --> 00:23:18.119]  It's just slopping hogs.
[00:23:20.382 --> 00:23:22.163]  I'm in a bind, I really need it.
[00:23:22.464 --> 00:23:24.425]  I'm in a bind, she called the hotline operator.
[00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:29.088]  There's a lot of stuff I know, but I didn't open my mouth.
[00:23:29.168 --> 00:23:34.492]  If I weren't in a bind, I wouldn't open my mouth, because I'm a white trash scum.
[00:23:34.732 --> 00:23:35.893]  It is a big idea.
[00:23:35.993 --> 00:23:37.074]  A new world order.
[00:23:37.154 --> 00:23:39.616]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by powers.
[00:23:51.454 --> 00:23:58.819]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:23:59.579 --> 00:24:06.904]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:24:09.895 --> 00:24:14.877]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:24:15.377 --> 00:24:19.039]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:24:19.239 --> 00:24:21.780]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.780]  Most people have no idea.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.721]  They're not after money.
[00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:24.961]  They have all the money they need.
[00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:25.842]  They're after power.
[00:24:26.002 --> 00:24:26.982]  That's what Africa needs.

[00:27:53.294 --> 00:28:21.663]  Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913 Made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three A hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid So, Cyrus Jones, live forever Gravedigger, when you dig my grave, would you make it shallow?
[00:28:23.756 --> 00:28:26.637]  Look, we've had it too good too long.
[00:28:51.803 --> 00:28:56.827]  And that's why we're gonna be slaves.
[00:28:56.867 --> 00:29:01.230]  We're gonna get hurt.
[00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.992]  Real bad.
[00:29:04.052 --> 00:29:06.033]  But they're good at scientifically doing it.
[00:29:06.954 --> 00:29:08.755]  To one person here, a couple there.
[00:29:09.476 --> 00:29:11.937]  Take this person's child, taser this person.
[00:29:13.298 --> 00:29:16.619]  Hit you with soft kill bioweapons and the vaccines to kill you slow.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.201]  Kick him down the road.
[00:29:20.261 --> 00:29:21.621]  But I guess Willie Nelson's right.
[00:29:23.922 --> 00:29:30.245]  In the end, we all fall down anyways.
[00:29:31.605 --> 00:29:33.246]  We all fall down.
[00:29:37.428 --> 00:29:39.449]  We all fall down.
[00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:42.330]  Brave Digger.
[00:29:43.487 --> 00:29:47.890]  John in Ohio, then Chris Mark and others.
[00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.051]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:29:50.712 --> 00:30:01.799]  Alex, before I get to my working against this privatization in my local city here, you know me as someone who's an unaffiliated freethinker who agrees with the Marxist-Socialist analysis.
[00:30:02.663 --> 00:30:17.366]  But I think that in certain ways, we've got, you know, my original exposure to Marxist and Socialist analysis was way back in the 60s and 70s with the Progressive Labor Party, PLP.org, if you want to look them up.
[00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:31.148]  But they were the first one to introduce me, long before you did, to the eugenics programs of the Rockefeller interest on Wall Street and the Bank of London and the Central Intelligence Agency, the World Bank, the IMF.
[00:30:31.658 --> 00:30:34.999]  They were the ones that first introduced me to false flag terrorism.
[00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:39.201]  They were the ones that introduced me to Operation Gladio way back in the 70s.
[00:30:39.241 --> 00:30:42.802]  I know, but you'll never listen that the globalists funded communism in their own documents.
[00:30:43.263 --> 00:30:44.343]  It's just impossible for you.
[00:30:44.363 --> 00:30:47.124]  You just deny all those facts and just say it isn't true.
[00:30:47.144 --> 00:30:48.264]  So fine, believe what you want, John.
[00:30:49.065 --> 00:30:52.726]  Well, the points I've just made, I think, speak for themselves.
[00:30:52.746 --> 00:30:59.589]  That, you know, there's a clear... Yeah, but the communists did false flag events too, John.
[00:31:00.253 --> 00:31:12.581]  The point I'm making here is, everything you've said along the point of eugenics has been in long monographs I've seen in PLP way back in the 60s and 70s, and that's why I agree with 60% of what you're saying, and I disagree with 40%.
[00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:27.790]  I think you're doing great work there, but I think in many ways you're contradictory, because, for instance, when you had David J. Smith on criticizing Chavez, and by implication, even Morales in... Well, let's get one thing straight.
[00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.951]  Hey, John, John.
[00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:30.131]  Hold on a minute.
[00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:40.638]  Number one, this is not some monolithic show, and I don't agree completely with every guest I have on, just like I don't completely agree with a lot of things you're saying.
[00:31:41.078 --> 00:31:46.262]  I mean, a lot of these other shows are monolithic, and it's all just one view or one idea.
[00:31:46.302 --> 00:31:48.964]  We're having a large college debate here.
[00:31:49.004 --> 00:31:49.284]  Go ahead.
[00:31:49.824 --> 00:32:01.169]  Okay, what I'm just saying, though, is that this kind of knee-jerk piggybacking on generations of anti-Communist corporate propaganda leads us into actually opposing the very things we support.
[00:32:01.209 --> 00:32:13.115]  For instance, even Morales in Bolivia actually opposed the privatization of the water after there was a revolutionary upheaval because the peasants and the workers down there couldn't even live because of what was going on.
[00:32:13.135 --> 00:32:13.835]  No, I understand.
[00:32:13.915 --> 00:32:14.616]  I understand that.
[00:32:15.316 --> 00:32:20.662]  I understand that communism is, quote, the solution in Latin America to a lot of the wrongs of neo-feudalism.
[00:32:21.543 --> 00:32:25.547]  But, you know, that's kind of like saying the cure for cyanide is arsenic.
[00:32:26.248 --> 00:32:27.870]  And, look, I appreciate your call, John.
[00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:36.079]  I mean, you never address Carol Quigley and the documents and Lord Milner and the fact that they funded the communists to destroy the czar.
[00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:41.583]  And that's just a fact, and so I don't believe it's a communist conspiracy.
[00:32:42.083 --> 00:32:50.645]  I believe communism is one tool, like radical Islam, the Wahhabists are created by the British Intel, just like all these major groups are.
[00:32:51.145 --> 00:32:59.426]  It's called the Great Game, and that's what Carol Quigley writes about, and that's really their corporate documents, that's their corporate history, their record.
[00:33:00.106 --> 00:33:03.107]  And so we're... Look, I reject your left-right paradigm.
[00:33:04.468 --> 00:33:14.173]  Just because I criticize what you know as the right-wing fascist structure doesn't mean that I then embrace the other wing of the same bird of prey, the left wing.
[00:33:14.754 --> 00:33:15.994]  I reject it all.
[00:33:16.054 --> 00:33:19.576]  It's part of a false paradigm, a false political template.
[00:33:20.777 --> 00:33:27.540]  Before the bankers put out their disinfo 120 years ago and then it became dominant in the last 80, people knew it as liberty versus tyranny.
[00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:28.461]  I'm for liberty.
[00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:29.902]  Period.
[00:33:31.382 --> 00:33:32.303]  We're on the march.
[00:33:33.143 --> 00:33:33.844]  Okay, Jones.
[00:33:36.732 --> 00:33:46.456]  Just because I criticize what you know as the right-wing fascist structure doesn't mean that I then embrace the other wing of the same bird of prey, the left wing.
[00:33:47.016 --> 00:33:48.257]  I reject it all.
[00:33:48.337 --> 00:33:51.858]  It's part of a false paradigm, a false political template.
[00:33:53.059 --> 00:33:59.802]  Before the bankers put out their disinfo 120 years ago, and then it became dominant in the last 80, people knew it as liberty versus tyranny.
[00:34:00.122 --> 00:34:00.742]  I'm for liberty.
[00:34:01.743 --> 00:34:02.003]  Period.
[00:34:03.576 --> 00:34:06.564]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:34:07.526 --> 00:34:10.213]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:15.711]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:34:15.831 --> 00:34:22.538]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:34:22.798 --> 00:34:30.987]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:34:31.207 --> 00:34:36.933]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:34:37.073 --> 00:34:38.875]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:34:38.935 --> 00:34:41.078]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:34:41.118 --> 00:34:45.483]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:34:45.664 --> 00:34:47.766]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:55.756]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:35:13.183 --> 00:35:18.345]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity theft each year.
[00:35:18.545 --> 00:35:23.307]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average of $8,000.
[00:35:24.567 --> 00:35:31.390]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication, and often the only protection between a hacker and your personal information.
[00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:40.360]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file, or any other file that is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.366]  With PasswordSafe Pro, your passwords can be secured in an encrypted database within minutes.
[00:35:46.647 --> 00:35:47.427]  We're good to go.
[00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:18.753]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:36:18.953 --> 00:36:23.815]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for the American empire instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:36:23.975 --> 00:36:29.898]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism, which is why you should be reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[00:36:30.278 --> 00:36:34.500]  We promote a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.

[00:37:08.314 --> 00:37:11.216]  I'm a liberated man.
[00:37:11.976 --> 00:37:16.058]  The rain it hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[00:37:16.799 --> 00:37:19.800]  And if it don't come soon my crops will die.
[00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:24.943]  The bankman says he likes me but there's nothing he can do.
[00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:29.866]  He tells me that he's coming but the clouds are coming too.
[00:37:31.387 --> 00:37:32.227]  He ain't my friend.
[00:37:37.092 --> 00:37:38.414]  The government's not your friend.
[00:37:38.814 --> 00:37:40.656]  It's run by absolutely ruthless criminals.
[00:37:40.696 --> 00:37:42.177]  You need to understand that.
[00:37:42.197 --> 00:37:43.599]  These are very dangerous people.
[00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:45.340]  They are trying to start World War III.
[00:38:00.343 --> 00:38:06.264]  All right, we're gonna go to Adam Cunnington here in a minute from We Are Change Kentucky.
[00:38:08.379 --> 00:38:11.441]  And ladies and gentlemen, what happened to them is just so incredible.
[00:38:12.862 --> 00:38:31.155]  I mean, not only being beat up, slammed to the ground, slammed one of their faces into the wall for no reason, equipment stolen, then the cops for close to an hour celebrated the evil and were talking about how they were going to charge them with felonies and do this and that and threatening them and screaming at them like drill sergeants and then laughing.
[00:38:33.663 --> 00:38:43.727]  I mean, I get really angry to read about grandmothers turning their grandchildren in for warrant money, you know, for marijuana, and the schools training the children to tattle on their parents.
[00:38:43.767 --> 00:38:51.250]  I mean, this country is far gone, and I feel the evil growing, and I just can't believe how bad we are, and how sick we are.
[00:38:52.629 --> 00:38:54.330]  And it is just so shameful.
[00:38:54.390 --> 00:39:06.594]  Everybody out there, the only defense to this is being not drinking and driving, not using any pharmacological drugs, not using any illegal drugs, and just really realizing that the world is very dangerous now.
[00:39:06.995 --> 00:39:11.016]  There are cockroaches and scum and trash and parasites everywhere.
[00:39:12.217 --> 00:39:13.757]  And the only revenge is living well.
[00:39:13.797 --> 00:39:15.438]  The only revenge is making it through this.
[00:39:16.518 --> 00:39:18.619]  And God help us when they fully implode the economy.
[00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:20.740]  The general public are just going to be absolute demons.
[00:39:21.995 --> 00:39:24.322]  And it's just, we are a nation of trash.
[00:39:25.956 --> 00:39:26.716]  It really is true.
[00:39:27.677 --> 00:39:28.917]  And the cancer's growing.
[00:39:29.037 --> 00:39:31.918]  I don't see any way the country can reverse the course.
[00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:35.920]  To see innocence framed.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:42.682]  In my new film, Truth Rising, it won't be out for a few months because we're still adding some things to it, but I showed screenings of it the last two nights.
[00:39:44.203 --> 00:39:50.606]  We've got police coming up and saying, that's a gun, your camera's a gun, I'm going to arrest you for this gun, and laughing with a DV cam tape.
[00:39:52.936 --> 00:39:54.876]  And you know, you can probably go to prison for a camera now.
[00:39:54.896 --> 00:39:56.077]  They'll say it's a laser beam.
[00:39:57.237 --> 00:39:58.237]  They'll say it's kryptonite.
[00:39:58.257 --> 00:39:58.717]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:39:58.737 --> 00:40:00.118]  They'll say it's a bomb, a nuclear bomb.
[00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:04.638]  Coming up and saying, we know you don't have bombs, but we're going to say you have bombs.
[00:40:06.219 --> 00:40:07.659]  No, that's what we are, folks.
[00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:10.180]  I mean, they always frame people, but now they just do it on tape.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.301]  And to know that these young men went in there and they just brought, they got press passes, they were polite.
[00:40:18.121 --> 00:40:21.702]  They brought up continued government concentration camps to North.
[00:40:23.223 --> 00:40:24.764]  And they then were leaving.
[00:40:26.185 --> 00:40:34.952]  Adam Cuttington, this happened to, with three other guys, called into the Sunday Show and told part of it.
[00:40:35.312 --> 00:40:36.913]  And then I heard and read the rest of it.
[00:40:36.933 --> 00:40:38.554]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:40:39.515 --> 00:40:42.197]  And it was even worse than what he was saying because they split them all up.
[00:40:42.677 --> 00:40:47.260]  You know, telling them, oh, you put one of those memory sticks, because you know, he had one memory stick in the camera, one in his pocket.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.980]  They didn't search him after they stole the cameras.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.042]  Oh, you got another memory stick.
[00:40:51.402 --> 00:40:54.563]  That's federal evidence, because this is a government facility.
[00:40:54.924 --> 00:40:56.304]  That makes it Homeland Security Federal.
[00:40:56.585 --> 00:40:58.806]  You're going to get a felony for this memory stick in your pocket.
[00:40:59.106 --> 00:41:00.307]  And I'm surprised they didn't say it was
[00:41:01.227 --> 00:41:03.728]  You know, anti-matter death star or something.
[00:41:03.768 --> 00:41:05.429]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:41:05.509 --> 00:41:16.492]  It's just all about lies, all about criminality, all about them ruling and just dominating and being bullies and being scum and they're hiring felons and hiring all... I mean, this is bad folks!
[00:41:16.512 --> 00:41:17.513]  They're building camps!
[00:41:17.813 --> 00:41:19.153]  I have it in the news today here.
[00:41:19.293 --> 00:41:20.294]  I know we got loaded phones.
[00:41:20.334 --> 00:41:20.934]  I'm going to get to you.
[00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:25.142]  It just, I can't believe this is happening.
[00:41:25.542 --> 00:41:26.743]  And they just incrementally do it.
[00:41:26.763 --> 00:41:27.884]  Let's go to Adam Cuttington.
[00:41:28.245 --> 00:41:34.230]  Adam, recap what happened to you, and then now talking to the other guys when they split you up, what they're saying.
[00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.773]  Because, I mean, our press is attacked.
[00:41:36.793 --> 00:41:38.014]  We don't even have press now.
[00:41:38.514 --> 00:41:41.577]  They've called for arresting We Are Change, attacking, killing.
[00:41:41.937 --> 00:41:45.260]  They've called for you to be taken to secret camps on national news.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.602]  That's a White House talking point.
[00:41:47.182 --> 00:41:55.610]  It scares them so much to have citizens come up at public events and embarrass them with real issues that they are escalating the violence towards us.
[00:41:56.751 --> 00:41:58.152]  People Google Oliver North.
[00:41:58.212 --> 00:42:04.438]  I want people to follow him everywhere he goes, go to every event, and bring up First Amendment questions to him, but bring more people.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.984]  This is just incredible, because if we let the chilling effect win, if we let them win, it's over.
[00:42:12.165 --> 00:42:12.325]  Adam?
[00:42:13.584 --> 00:42:15.245]  Yeah, great to be with you again, Alex.
[00:42:15.265 --> 00:42:24.573]  Recap what happened, and give me all those other developments, because I heard you guys last time on another show with Cosmos really getting into it all, because it was even worse than what you were saying on my show.
[00:42:25.834 --> 00:42:36.683]  Yeah, from just being in my own perspective and us splitting pretty much after that happened, you know, I didn't get even everybody else's full account.
[00:42:38.905 --> 00:42:42.888]  Like I said yesterday, we had confronted Oliver North.
[00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.603]  Uh, first on continuity of government.
[00:42:46.264 --> 00:42:49.207]  Uh, we supported a new investigation of 9-11 in camps.
[00:42:50.728 --> 00:42:53.090]  Um, then Ted Nugent on 9-11.
[00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:56.714]  Uh, when we were about to leave, um, we went
[00:42:57.674 --> 00:43:03.177]  We've seen that Auburn North was doing a book signing in D Hall and decided to go over and hang in some literature.
[00:43:03.457 --> 00:43:06.859]  And let's be clear, a lot of these guys are former Iraq troops from the last five years.
[00:43:07.139 --> 00:43:16.925]  You go to a death camp for, and that's in the news today, for secret execution before you're thrown into a lime pit for even criticizing the government in Iraq under the democracy.
[00:43:17.305 --> 00:43:20.667]  And so for them, that's why I've taken you to a lime pit in the near future.
[00:43:20.687 --> 00:43:21.988]  And I'm not joking, folks.
[00:43:22.228 --> 00:43:23.909]  I don't kid around on the show or exaggerate.
[00:43:24.269 --> 00:43:26.310]  They are training to murder you and your family.
[00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:39.822]  They stood across the hall when they went up to the table to get that event from another angle, and they ended up swarming at that time.
[00:43:39.842 --> 00:43:45.887]  They confiscated our press passes and told us to leave.
[00:43:46.407 --> 00:43:49.350]  We were walking out the hall.
[00:43:51.901 --> 00:43:58.806]  The camera was actually tried, the officer behind it all tried snatching the camera out of Sam's hand.
[00:43:59.346 --> 00:44:03.549]  That's why he jerked back on it and was taken to the ground.
[00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:07.852]  He jerked back on a God when he snuck up and grabbed at the camera?
[00:44:08.492 --> 00:44:11.494]  Oh my God, you even looked at a God?
[00:44:11.835 --> 00:44:14.276]  Moses had to look at a bush, you were looking at them?
[00:44:14.296 --> 00:44:17.659]  I mean, he just came up from behind them.
[00:44:19.076 --> 00:44:22.978]  Yeah, just from behind him and try to grab it, I mean, what would be a normal reaction?
[00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:33.062]  So anyways, that's when I believe they tried provoking an incident and actually taking him to the ground and putting him in cuffs.
[00:44:33.582 --> 00:44:35.203]  We're continuing to be let off that.
[00:44:36.983 --> 00:44:40.545]  Outside, Cody Deeds tried... Have you seen the pictures where they caught him up?
[00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:42.906]  Yeah, I've seen the hand.
[00:44:44.226 --> 00:44:44.927]  The picture of the hand.
[00:44:44.947 --> 00:44:46.167]  Well, that's what Alcata gets.
[00:44:46.247 --> 00:44:47.868]  Well, tell folks what else happened.
[00:44:50.332 --> 00:44:50.792]  Third world cesspit.
[00:44:50.832 --> 00:44:54.133]  Now let's be clear, you had official press passes.
[00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:24.635]  We had trespasses that were acquired weeks before through the NRA Public Affairs Office.
[00:45:25.156 --> 00:45:38.250]  Because on the NRAILA.org website... Now that's the National Registration Assault Group.
[00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.511]  Go ahead.
[00:45:40.021 --> 00:45:45.766]  Um, I said it was open to the press, so I called, gave the credentials, they were waiting for us when we got there.
[00:45:46.647 --> 00:45:47.387]  Everything was fine.
[00:45:47.407 --> 00:45:49.389]  Oh, this is sick.
[00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:59.917]  So, anyways, after they take our memory and our batteries, what have you, um, they kind of get us off to a different side, threaten us with different things.
[00:46:00.338 --> 00:46:01.839]  Uh, Cody's threatened with, uh,
[00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:11.723]  Federal, I believe, Class D felony for tampering with evidence, supposedly, because he tried removing the memory stick from his camera before... Tampering with evidence.
[00:46:12.063 --> 00:46:14.385]  Oh, so they were claiming a crime was committed with the cameras.
[00:46:14.706 --> 00:46:15.987]  See how they just make stuff up?
[00:46:16.027 --> 00:46:16.988]  It's totally made up.
[00:46:17.368 --> 00:46:19.070]  False charges, official oppression.
[00:46:21.933 --> 00:46:24.996]  Have you learned the names of any of these dirtbags, or they wouldn't give it to you?
[00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:33.400]  They wouldn't give us any information on the officer that... Yeah, they're just gonna stand down to the ground.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.961]  They're just gonna steal your equipment, that's probably wasn't even a cop.
[00:46:36.681 --> 00:46:39.181]  They're just gonna steal your equipment, that's it, and they're just, shut up!
[00:46:39.421 --> 00:46:39.801]  Shut up!
[00:46:41.262 --> 00:46:41.982]  So what else happened?
[00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:49.283]  Like I said, they were threatened us with felonies, what have you, federal felonies, because it was state property.
[00:46:55.706 --> 00:47:01.891]  Erased all of our memories, gave us the cameras back, and released Sam, and told us to get out of here, banned us from the property for life.
[00:47:02.672 --> 00:47:07.236]  And we went our own ways from there.
[00:47:07.656 --> 00:47:23.129]  But the entire event, I mean, literally minutes before we were watching Ted Nugent upstairs talk about kill any carjacker or anyone you see committing crime with Louisville Metro Police Department, standing right next to him, smiling.
[00:47:25.445 --> 00:47:27.188]  Yeah, we're way far gone.
[00:47:27.208 --> 00:47:33.456]  I got an article here where there's not 1 million people now in the terror database, it's 8 million.
[00:47:45.698 --> 00:47:48.879]  Oh, we're all terrorists, and the cops are training to fight roadside bombs.
[00:47:48.919 --> 00:47:50.120]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:56.102]  It's all made up to federalize everything, and they're going to push and push until people fight back, and then they're going to say, see?
[00:47:56.142 --> 00:47:57.483]  There's terrorists everywhere.
[00:47:58.463 --> 00:48:02.885]  You know, oh, this father won't let you take his three-year-old for no reason.
[00:48:02.925 --> 00:48:04.846]  Oh, he's a terrorist.
[00:48:06.093 --> 00:48:07.775]  Oh, I'm the authority!
[00:48:08.075 --> 00:48:17.765]  I'm just so sick of all these do-nothing, nobody people with low IQs that then rule over us and just have their way with us while the bankers set up on high over us.
[00:48:18.206 --> 00:48:19.467]  I mean, aren't you sick of it, Adam?
[00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:21.649]  I'm completely sick.
[00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:22.690]  I'm fed up.
[00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.831]  I'm sick to my stomach, brother.
[00:48:26.554 --> 00:48:28.576]  Yeah, I mean, it's not even an anger or a rage anymore.
[00:48:28.616 --> 00:48:29.177]  I'm just like...
[00:48:32.054 --> 00:48:37.138]  I guess you haven't heard me read the New York Times article where people are turning in their grandchildren for money?
[00:48:38.379 --> 00:48:41.121]  That's how people make their money in America now, is tattletale lines?
[00:48:44.603 --> 00:48:45.164]  It's ridiculous.
[00:48:48.171 --> 00:48:48.571]  Please stay.
[00:49:18.591 --> 00:49:19.572]  I'm right there with you, brother.
[00:49:19.612 --> 00:49:24.216]  Cops don't need to come out to domestic disturbance or what have you, but it's my using their First Amendment.
[00:49:38.087 --> 00:49:39.289]  Uh, I mean, it's slut.
[00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:41.792]  It's form, you know?
[00:49:56.809 --> 00:49:57.189]  We're good to go.
[00:50:16.274 --> 00:50:16.935]  Is that for money?
[00:50:17.775 --> 00:50:20.498]  But their advertising makes no bones about the benefits of a good tip.
[00:50:20.978 --> 00:50:30.547]  Now here in Austin for at least 10 years, they give every elementary and middle school student by a 5th grade, they give them a card and they get 200 bucks and they turn family members in and they just teach them.
[00:50:30.567 --> 00:50:31.568]  Turn your mommy and daddy in.
[00:50:31.888 --> 00:50:38.674]  And then the parents send their children to this place where your children are being taught to look for you doing something wrong?
[00:50:39.471 --> 00:50:40.673]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:50:41.354 --> 00:50:44.620]  We live in a prison with a bunch of drug dealers running it.
[00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:45.762]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:50:46.363 --> 00:50:48.347]  It's not enough for you to bring the drugs in?
[00:50:48.787 --> 00:50:49.389]  You have to then
[00:50:52.432 --> 00:50:53.493]  What would you like to see happen?
[00:51:10.926 --> 00:51:16.271]  At the Cornerstone Church, 726 West Old Hickory Boulevard, Madison, Tennessee.
[00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:16.891]  More info.
[00:51:17.392 --> 00:51:21.195]  And because he's such an important trafficker and death squad commander for them, they're listening.
[00:51:21.215 --> 00:51:22.316]  You'll be aware of it.
[00:51:22.336 --> 00:51:25.339]  But I say 20, 30 of you go and just peacefully ask questions.
[00:51:25.939 --> 00:51:28.982]  And have people out front in cars to get video of the whole thing.
[00:51:29.002 --> 00:51:34.066]  And show how the whole anti-terror apparatus is about stopping you from asking questions.
[00:51:34.747 --> 00:51:37.671]  But the border's wide open and drug dealers killed a bunch of cops last week.
[00:51:38.311 --> 00:51:40.374]  Doesn't matter, they'll now learn to work for the CIA.
[00:51:40.414 --> 00:51:41.455]  The CIA's got their proxy.
[00:51:42.826 --> 00:51:50.611]  We've got Sunday Cornerstone Church again, May 25th at 8pm, 726 West Old Hickory Road, Madison, Tennessee.
[00:51:51.192 --> 00:51:55.615]  We've got a lot of listeners in Tennessee, and people should go to this.
[00:51:56.896 --> 00:52:04.321]  I don't think it'll be as bad there, because they'll just have some local goons, and sometimes you've got cops that still think this is America, and they'll just tell you to leave.
[00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:05.782]  Leave when they say it, though.
[00:52:06.682 --> 00:52:12.186]  Are you thinking about going around Lord North anymore, or have you had enough rodeo with him?
[00:52:13.627 --> 00:52:16.788]  If he comes back around the area, I mean, I'll be glad to go ask him questions again.
[00:52:16.808 --> 00:52:18.609]  I mean, it's my patriotic duty.
[00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:24.413]  Well, you guys, even though you had your property stolen, how many memory sticks, how many batteries?
[00:52:28.175 --> 00:52:32.457]  I know of my battery, and I believe another one, me and Cody had memory, or me, Cody,
[00:52:34.645 --> 00:52:35.746]  Brad had memory sticks.
[00:52:36.166 --> 00:52:40.328]  I believe Sam had a straight-to DVD, I believe.
[00:52:40.949 --> 00:52:44.230]  Or straight-to mini-disc, I believe.
[00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:46.732]  Well, three batteries, two chips.
[00:52:47.692 --> 00:52:51.094]  We're talking $300 easy of stolen goodies.
[00:52:51.374 --> 00:52:52.255]  And that's what they do.
[00:52:52.695 --> 00:52:54.496]  No judge, no jury, no arrest.
[00:52:54.936 --> 00:52:55.957]  They've been in Baghdad.
[00:52:56.177 --> 00:52:57.758]  You're not going to be a slave, and that's the end of it.
[00:52:58.018 --> 00:52:59.359]  Well, we'll talk to you as this develops.
[00:52:59.399 --> 00:53:00.099]  Get a hold of the guys.
[00:53:00.119 --> 00:53:01.340]  I want to have you all on tomorrow.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.301]  Take care, Adam.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:03.480]  You too.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.481]  Appreciate you man.
[00:53:05.862 --> 00:53:09.104]  And again folks, we're in dire straits when they're going after the press like this.
[00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:11.145]  I mean, we're in dire, dire straits.
[00:53:12.386 --> 00:53:14.566]  Not enough to have free speech zones and trample everything.
[00:53:15.227 --> 00:53:16.807]  Don't forget our sponsors.
[00:53:16.827 --> 00:53:17.627]  We've got a final segment.
[00:53:17.647 --> 00:53:23.608]  I'm going to come back and take some calls, but our sponsors for this show are Interfood, Aloes, and eFoods Direct.
[00:53:24.288 --> 00:53:28.729]  Interfood is the best green food, bar none, out there anywhere that I have found.
[00:53:28.749 --> 00:53:31.830]  20 really power packed ingredients for 100% absorption.
[00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:35.211]  It's unpasteurized superfoods.
[00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:36.591]  We take it here in the office.
[00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:37.091]  We love it.
[00:53:37.131 --> 00:53:40.532]  Dull skelp, barley grass, wheat grass, coralina, spirulina, corella.
[00:53:41.272 --> 00:53:41.472]  I think?
[00:54:07.173 --> 00:54:17.678]  The people that bring you the fine products like the Beta Prostate, like the Colon Cleanse, Body Cleanse, New Vitality, Big Banner, up on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:18.239 --> 00:54:20.040]  Be sure and visit that.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.721]  Be sure and check that out.
[00:54:23.321 --> 00:54:26.523]  Aloe really flushes you out, really cleans you out, detoxifies you.
[00:54:26.543 --> 00:54:27.523]  It'll probably be illegal soon.
[00:54:27.543 --> 00:54:27.944]  I'm not joking.
[00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:30.245]  They're trying to ban all herbs products for you.
[00:54:31.005 --> 00:54:33.327]  1-800-569-4056, 1-800-569-4056.
[00:54:33.367 --> 00:54:38.612]  We'll come back in the final segment, but don't forget Aloe's Body Cleanse.
[00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:42.816]  It is a big idea.
[00:54:42.836 --> 00:54:44.958]  A new world order.
[00:54:45.659 --> 00:54:50.483]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:54:50.563 --> 00:54:52.305]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:54:53.386 --> 00:54:55.568]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:54:56.155 --> 00:54:58.577]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[00:54:59.338 --> 00:55:07.125]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream... 1-800-569-4056, 1-800-569-4056.
[00:55:07.605 --> 00:55:10.888]  We'll come back in the final segment, but don't forget Aloe's Body Cleanse.
[00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.012]  It is a big idea.
[00:55:15.032 --> 00:55:17.133]  A New World Order.
[00:55:17.854 --> 00:55:22.118]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:55:22.742 --> 00:55:24.885]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:55:25.545 --> 00:55:27.748]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:30.791]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:55:31.532 --> 00:55:38.841]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:55:41.866 --> 00:55:46.849]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:50.772]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:55:51.192 --> 00:55:53.674]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:55:53.754 --> 00:55:54.895]  Most people have no idea.
[00:55:54.915 --> 00:55:55.675]  They're not after money.
[00:55:55.715 --> 00:55:56.776]  They have all the money they need.
[00:55:56.976 --> 00:55:57.677]  They're after power.
[00:55:57.957 --> 00:55:58.637]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:55:59.118 --> 00:56:03.661]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:56:10.645 --> 00:56:11.666]  You have been warned.
[00:56:14.228 --> 00:56:17.071]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:22.596]  Another untold story, here it comes.
[00:56:23.357 --> 00:56:29.603]  Another untold story that you've not been told from anotheruntoldstory.com.
[00:56:33.058 --> 00:56:44.483]  There is in the greatest storybook ever written a statement that the greatest storyteller who ever told a story, and all his stories are true, mind you, that that greatest storyteller is not mocked.
[00:56:44.903 --> 00:56:48.865]  There are the mockers, but it is not generally told what happens to them.
[00:56:49.548 --> 00:56:56.050]  What happened to the famous figure who said Christianity will end, it will disappear, etc., etc.?
[00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:05.053]  What happened to the Brazilian president who said if he got 500,000 votes from his party, not even God could remove him from presidency?
[00:57:05.675 --> 00:57:09.860]  What happened when the builder of the Titanic said not even God could sink it?
[00:57:10.381 --> 00:57:16.689]  What happened to the mocking group who laughingly said God could not get in their car unless it was in the trunk?
[00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:22.016]  What happened to the Jamaica journalist who said the Bible was the worst book ever written?
[00:57:22.356 --> 00:57:28.482]  What happened to the famous actress who mockingly said to a famed evangelist, I don't need your Jesus.
[00:57:28.943 --> 00:57:35.610]  There's more to this list of mockers which we tell and then tell the untold of what actually happened.
[00:57:44.991 --> 00:57:47.953]  There's a lot of you out there laughing about everything I've said.
[00:57:47.973 --> 00:57:53.516]  But you're going to find out soon enough and I'm not joking about any of it.
[00:57:57.158 --> 00:58:02.421]  This century is going to make the last century pale in significance.
[00:58:03.942 --> 00:58:05.823]  Blood is going to flow through the streets.
[00:58:07.464 --> 00:58:09.805]  And all you tough guy cops
[00:58:12.153 --> 00:58:16.856]  You're going to be so tired of killing fellow citizens and beating them, it's not going to be fun anymore.
[00:58:19.337 --> 00:58:20.278]  This is what you want?
[00:58:21.059 --> 00:58:28.823]  This is what you get.
[00:58:28.843 --> 00:58:29.944]  You want to be a big man?
[00:58:30.284 --> 00:58:32.526]  You want to be an evil thug?
[00:58:32.546 --> 00:58:34.027]  Don't worry.
[00:58:37.879 --> 00:58:39.459]  You're gonna get to be.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.381]  You're gonna get to have your wish, all of it.
[00:58:43.881 --> 00:58:45.541]  The truth is, dreams come true.
[00:58:47.142 --> 00:58:48.782]  A lot of you are in love with nightmares.
[00:58:50.082 --> 00:58:52.163]  But you're gonna get to live those nightmares you've had.
[00:58:52.623 --> 00:58:53.863]  What you thought were dreams.
[00:58:55.564 --> 00:58:57.444]  The truth is, we all get what we want.
[00:58:59.225 --> 00:59:00.105]  What we truly want.
[00:59:05.444 --> 00:59:07.144]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Florida.
[00:59:07.164 --> 00:59:07.804]  You're on the air, Chris.
[00:59:07.824 --> 00:59:08.645]  We've got to move quick.
[00:59:10.465 --> 00:59:10.905]  Hey, Alex.
[00:59:11.125 --> 00:59:11.385]  Hi.
[00:59:12.105 --> 00:59:19.687]  For all those people that think that, you know, none of this is happening, you know, I can absolutely vouch for the fact that it is.
[00:59:20.407 --> 00:59:33.549]  And I think that we're so far past the time for arguing and, you know, the people that call your show and, you know, try to say that, you know, you know, they argue with you, and then you're out, and the chicken necks, like you like to call them.
[00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:43.156]  You know, in Florida I have a personal experience with the police where I had a car that was bought and paid for.
[00:59:43.176 --> 00:59:54.866]  At the time it was a nice new Explorer and they pulled me over and they threw some dope in the back and they possessed my car.
[00:59:56.027 --> 00:59:57.948]  And I got a felony conviction.
[00:59:59.209 --> 01:00:03.513]  I told my probation officer that I was completely innocent.
[01:00:04.855 --> 01:00:09.657]  He said, yeah, it happens all the time, you know, and that was it.
[01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:13.599]  Now, you know, I'm afraid that, you know, I can't get it done.
[01:00:14.279 --> 01:00:16.480]  What did you say to these hardcore demons?
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.121]  Hold on, sir, we're going to go into overdrive.
[01:00:18.621 --> 01:00:26.504]  In fact, tell the two, that's all right, just about 15 minutes, because I've got a Ron Paul retransmission interview that's coming up on the InfoWare stream in about 20 minutes, so I don't want to miss that.
[01:00:27.005 --> 01:00:30.186]  But I want Mark and Rich and everybody else that's holding to hold over.
[01:00:30.546 --> 01:00:32.287]  We're good for overdrive, another 20 minutes or so?
[01:00:32.887 --> 01:00:33.107]  Good.
[01:00:34.068 --> 01:00:35.630]  But I want to hear your story.
[01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:38.472]  What did you say to this individual?
[01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:43.076]  And for the callers, call in 512-646-5400.
[01:00:43.096 --> 01:00:43.777]  512-646-5400.
[01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:47.681]  Including you, Chris, in Florida.
[01:00:48.181 --> 01:00:49.142]  We'll let you go in a minute.
[01:00:49.602 --> 01:00:51.824]  I mean, did you say to them, why are you doing this to me?
[01:00:51.945 --> 01:00:52.465]  I'm a human.
[01:00:52.485 --> 01:00:53.806]  Did you talk to the psychopaths?
[01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:55.768]  Because sometimes it works to go, I'm a human.
[01:00:55.788 --> 01:00:56.509]  I have a family.
[01:00:56.809 --> 01:00:57.450]  Don't do this.
[01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.171]  I was polite as could be.
[01:00:59.232 --> 01:01:00.273]  I had never had an arrest before.
[01:01:12.826 --> 01:01:14.487]  I guess they were bored.
[01:01:14.928 --> 01:01:19.490]  They came over and I was being totally compliant.
[01:01:20.011 --> 01:01:22.792]  I said, you can search my car with the dog if you want.
[01:01:22.913 --> 01:01:23.953]  Well, that's why they did that.
[01:01:24.173 --> 01:01:27.996]  Because once you've done that, they can make a fake conviction and stick with the consent.
[01:01:28.296 --> 01:01:29.016]  Just work with us.
[01:01:29.036 --> 01:01:31.218]  We're your friends, Mr. Johnson, or whatever your name is.
[01:01:32.353 --> 01:01:32.613]  Right.
[01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:39.596]  And what happened was one of the cops was kind of playing the nice cop and the other one was playing kind of the, you know, the tough guy.
[01:01:39.816 --> 01:01:40.937]  Yeah, it's all about winning.
[01:01:40.977 --> 01:01:43.098]  It's about hurting the American and having the victory.
[01:01:43.318 --> 01:01:43.558]  Yeah.
[01:01:44.278 --> 01:01:44.459]  Why?
[01:01:44.499 --> 01:01:45.819]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:45.839 --> 01:01:47.240]  Because they're evil, sir.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.261]  They're probably both hardcore drug dealing felons.
[01:01:49.721 --> 01:01:51.522]  Tell you what, I want to hear more of this story.
[01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.763]  I want you to call me right now at 512-646-5400, okay?
[01:01:57.435 --> 01:01:59.436]  Let me see if I can remember that.
[01:01:59.696 --> 01:02:01.037]  Listen, here's the number again.
[01:02:01.057 --> 01:02:03.738]  512-646-5400, okay?
[01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:06.080]  John will just give it to you right now.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:07.300]  Put him on hold and give it to him.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.181]  Other callers call that.
[01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:09.301]  We're out of time.
[01:02:09.722 --> 01:02:11.102]  We'll see you at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:11.222 --> 01:02:12.443]  Only on the streams right now.
[01:02:12.683 --> 01:02:13.984]  Ron Paul's coming up in 30 minutes.
[01:02:14.004 --> 01:02:18.246]  You gotta go to InfoWars.com right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:18.586 --> 01:02:20.747]  InfoWars.com right now.
[01:02:24.042 --> 01:02:24.823]  Hey, take care, Jones.
[01:02:25.043 --> 01:02:25.904]  Thanks a lot, brother.
[01:02:25.964 --> 01:02:27.585]  Just give that fella the number, please.
[01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:28.526]  I'll do that right now.
[01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:29.287]  Okay, thank you.
[01:02:29.427 --> 01:02:31.969]  We'll see you tomorrow.
[01:02:31.989 --> 01:02:32.669]  Thank you.
[01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:37.514]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we'll now have the intro music for the Overdrive.
[01:02:38.014 --> 01:02:40.396]  And I'm only going to do about 20 minutes because Ron Paul's coming up.
[01:02:40.476 --> 01:02:43.419]  Amazing revelations in my 30-minute interview with him today.
[01:02:43.859 --> 01:02:47.682]  And so, in the restreams, that is going to be there.
[01:02:48.423 --> 01:02:50.885]  So we were able to get Mark in Florida and Rich
[01:02:51.946 --> 01:02:54.248]  I guess the other, uh, Chris was unable to call in.
[01:02:54.948 --> 01:02:57.350]  Yeah, I mean, I ought to do a show sometime with those framed by police.
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.191]  And I mean, it's admitted, they do it all over the place.
[01:02:59.211 --> 01:03:06.657]  Uh, and they just pull you over, and they, nice car, and they just... Then they get the money.
[01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:15.323]  And, uh, man... What do you do when the bandits rule?
[01:03:17.028 --> 01:03:18.889]  What do you do when you have no recourse?
[01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:23.391]  What do you do when you have a tyranny, which is the majority of the world, and what happens most of the time?
[01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:34.677]  We all know cops are bad in Mexico, bad in Russia, bad in Nigeria, but I guess we've just gone bad.
[01:03:36.383 --> 01:03:39.465]  You got general public who's unaware of this.
[01:03:39.485 --> 01:03:41.366]  You got good cops who don't even know it's corrupt.
[01:03:41.846 --> 01:03:44.207]  They're right next to the corruption, but they're on their own little world.
[01:03:44.227 --> 01:03:47.029]  They have blinders on, or rose-covered glasses.
[01:03:47.049 --> 01:03:49.370]  They don't see the corruption.
[01:03:50.151 --> 01:03:56.074]  They don't, um... ...see what's happening.
[01:03:58.996 --> 01:04:14.159]  I know we've got like 15 phone calls or something that just came in, but I'm going to let you try to screen those, and by screening them you'll find out which one is Chris, because I want to tell the story about him, polite, the police coming over and framing him, and again,
[01:04:15.231 --> 01:04:30.010]  I use this example because NPR did a piece, it was in some national news, for more than a decade, the narcotics squad, the Dallas Police Department, hundreds of officers, would just randomly pull over, nice Corvettes, nice Mercedes, and they'd drop chalk in the back.
[01:04:31.192 --> 01:04:32.353]  And then they would seize the car.
[01:04:32.413 --> 01:04:34.053]  No judge, no jury, no arrest.
[01:04:34.513 --> 01:04:36.634]  They would just take it and say, asset forfeiture seizure.
[01:04:37.295 --> 01:04:42.197]  And then finally, they got so corrupt, they were stealing the cocaine out of the locker and doing a bunch of other stuff.
[01:04:42.237 --> 01:04:46.659]  So, cops inside blew the whistle and it all came down and they'd framed thousands.
[01:04:48.281 --> 01:04:50.582]  But the crime lab was certifying it.
[01:04:50.602 --> 01:04:52.163]  They knew it was chalk, they were part of it.
[01:04:52.924 --> 01:04:54.484]  And it was all a big kickback scheme.
[01:04:55.945 --> 01:05:00.868]  I kind of woke up to this because I worked at a gym in high school here in Austin, in the Napier High School for a couple of years.
[01:05:01.768 --> 01:05:04.570]  And there were some FBI agents that worked out there.
[01:05:04.590 --> 01:05:05.330]  I knew their sons.
[01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:09.432]  And I went to their house once or twice and went out to eat with them a few times.
[01:05:09.492 --> 01:05:11.553]  And I remember, you know, how is an FBI agent?
[01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:12.654]  I was like, your mom doesn't work.
[01:05:14.121 --> 01:05:22.626]  Uh, and uh, you know, you don't, you know, and you're going to UT and you drive, all drive nice cars and you're still on your dad's, you know, is he an author?
[01:05:22.646 --> 01:05:23.646]  Does he do something else?
[01:05:24.147 --> 01:05:30.270]  No, you know, dad, you know, lives on Cat Mountain in what would be like a $3 million house today, probably like $500,000, $600,000 then.
[01:05:30.450 --> 01:05:35.873]  And uh, you know, I mean, I grew up in an upper middle class neighborhood myself.
[01:05:36.613 --> 01:05:41.537]  Where the FBI raided a cocaine dealer in like some six bedroom thing with a pool.
[01:05:41.577 --> 01:05:43.178]  You know, it wasn't huge houses, but nice ones.
[01:05:43.939 --> 01:05:46.461]  And he ended up moving into that down the street from us.
[01:05:46.481 --> 01:05:48.142]  It was like down the hills.
[01:05:48.202 --> 01:05:49.023]  It was a golf course.
[01:05:49.043 --> 01:05:52.165]  It was like a hole number seven or something right in front of us.
[01:05:52.205 --> 01:05:53.826]  And then down was the FBI guy's house.
[01:05:58.976 --> 01:06:00.416]  And then I found out stuff about him.
[01:06:00.436 --> 01:06:01.777]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:02.817]  I mean, God help us.
[01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:03.457]  God help us.
[01:06:03.997 --> 01:06:05.478]  Let's go back to Chris in Florida.
[01:06:06.658 --> 01:06:08.678]  Chris, just from the start, tell the story.
[01:06:08.978 --> 01:06:09.819]  Was it night time?
[01:06:09.879 --> 01:06:10.419]  Sunny day?
[01:06:10.459 --> 01:06:11.459]  Where you were in Florida?
[01:06:11.899 --> 01:06:12.959]  How they set you up?
[01:06:13.059 --> 01:06:13.780]  What it's like?
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:17.480]  Because this is going to be happening to a lot more Americans when they plant the drugs on you.
[01:06:19.001 --> 01:06:19.361]  Okay.
[01:06:20.621 --> 01:06:21.401]  It was the evening.
[01:06:22.422 --> 01:06:24.682]  And I worked at a plumbing company.
[01:06:24.702 --> 01:06:26.583]  I don't want to go into too many details.
[01:06:26.603 --> 01:06:27.903]  I'm a little bit nervous telling the story.
[01:06:28.795 --> 01:06:50.665]  It happened like ten years ago, nine, ten years ago, and I was giving a guy a ride home from work, and he lived on the main road, Powerline Road, and it's kind of a Martin Luther King Boulevard, and it's kind of a bad section of town, or, you know.
[01:06:52.526 --> 01:06:57.388]  Well, anyway, I was giving the guy a ride home, and they said that I ran three
[01:06:58.226 --> 01:06:58.807]  Red lights.
[01:06:59.647 --> 01:07:00.148]  Which I didn't.
[01:07:01.148 --> 01:07:04.230]  I mean, who would rent three red lights if a police officer was behind them?
[01:07:05.351 --> 01:07:12.056]  And, um, basically what they did was, you know, they asked me if, you know, who I was, my identification, everything.
[01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:15.318]  They asked me if my car was owned.
[01:07:16.099 --> 01:07:17.420]  And they said, you shouldn't be down here.
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.062]  And I said, no, I'm, you know, bringing this guy home.
[01:07:20.082 --> 01:07:21.523]  This and that, everything checked out.
[01:07:21.623 --> 01:07:24.225]  They, you know, said, what are you pulling me over for?
[01:07:25.391 --> 01:07:29.493]  And, you know, they were going to get a dog out there to search.
[01:07:29.853 --> 01:07:33.755]  They let the guy that I was the passenger, I was bringing, go home.
[01:07:34.876 --> 01:07:37.297]  And they kept me out there for three hours.
[01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:38.378]  It was humiliating.
[01:07:39.158 --> 01:07:42.200]  And I was trying to be compliant because I knew I wasn't doing anything.
[01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:44.621]  That's a code word.
[01:07:44.681 --> 01:07:46.582]  Be compliant while we destroy America.
[01:07:47.182 --> 01:07:47.923]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:48.883 --> 01:07:50.164]  And at the time, I was young.
[01:07:50.204 --> 01:07:50.844]  I mean, I'm 31.
[01:07:52.534 --> 01:07:55.496]  I think I was about 21 at the time, and I didn't know my rights.
[01:07:55.516 --> 01:07:57.797]  I had never had anything like this happen to me before.
[01:07:58.718 --> 01:08:07.322]  And basically what happened was, they made me sit there, coughed while they searched my car with a dog, and I was basically spanked search away.
[01:08:07.943 --> 01:08:09.664]  The one cop was getting a little bit upset.
[01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:13.506]  The other guy was saying, just, you know, hold on, you know, this will be over in a little bit.
[01:08:14.332 --> 01:08:17.794]  You know, they emptied out every single, you know, tore the car apart.
[01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:23.576]  Have you seen all these videos online where the squad car video, where the cop plants it?
[01:08:23.816 --> 01:08:26.657]  They'll go, oh, and reach in and pull it out.
[01:08:27.038 --> 01:08:30.959]  You'll see him pull it out of his own pants and then cup it in his hand and then plant it.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.180]  I don't know how these guys do this, man.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.221]  It's so wicked.
[01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:37.062]  Oh, he had to have this in his trunk or something.
[01:08:37.542 --> 01:08:39.183]  I mean, you know, wherever he got it from.
[01:08:40.112 --> 01:08:48.559]  And what happened was that the one cop gave the other cop the signal because he was, you know, standing over me and I was cuffed on the sidewalk.
[01:08:48.579 --> 01:08:49.680]  Yeah, they always give signals.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.280]  Yeah, that's on tape.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:50.561]  Yeah.
[01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:54.444]  And I thought he was giving me the signal to let me go and so did the other cop.
[01:08:54.724 --> 01:08:55.825]  And then he said, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:55.945 --> 01:08:57.926]  And then he didn't read my rights, of course.
[01:08:58.647 --> 01:09:00.929]  And then he threw me in the back of the car.
[01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:06.195]  Then I saw the two of them talk in the front of the car, and I couldn't hear it because the door was closed.
[01:09:06.415 --> 01:09:10.399]  And then he walked over to the back and he said, let me get your wallet.
[01:09:10.559 --> 01:09:11.600]  And I said, well, I'm handcuffed.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.101]  So he said, well, sit up.
[01:09:13.422 --> 01:09:15.123]  And he grabbed my wallet.
[01:09:15.644 --> 01:09:17.206]  And then I said, well, what do you need my wallet for?
[01:09:17.226 --> 01:09:20.669]  And he said, shut up, or I'll spray you.
[01:09:20.769 --> 01:09:23.392]  Shut up, or I'll spray you.
[01:09:23.512 --> 01:09:25.434]  That was an old form of torture, yeah.
[01:09:26.321 --> 01:09:37.564]  And, um, so then they, you know, they drive me down to the, um, you know, the substation, and as they're going through my contents, you know, they're like, this is your wallet, this is your driver's license, you know how they do that.
[01:09:38.184 --> 01:09:45.966]  And what happens is then all of a sudden they turn my wallet upside down, emptied it out, and these little things that look like wax fell out.
[01:09:45.986 --> 01:09:51.648]  And, and, and, and, and, and, and why would they arrest you in the first place and then find it in the, you know?
[01:09:52.333 --> 01:09:52.913]  Exactly.
[01:09:52.933 --> 01:09:55.954]  I mean, it was so ridiculous.
[01:09:56.754 --> 01:09:58.995]  And what they have is these diversion programs.
[01:09:59.015 --> 01:10:03.936]  You know, I had called you a couple weeks back, Alex, about my girlfriend, that we had had the argument on the phone.
[01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:06.337]  And they had taken her out of the house.
[01:10:06.677 --> 01:10:08.977]  You know, she was just talking to me loud on the telephone.
[01:10:09.917 --> 01:10:12.218]  And, um, you know, the police arrested her.
[01:10:12.318 --> 01:10:14.359]  Well, I told you, Florida's bad, man.
[01:10:14.439 --> 01:10:15.699]  It's probably the worst.
[01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:16.699]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:16.839 --> 01:10:18.700]  Oh, jeez, they couldn't... But, I mean, finish up.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.780]  What happened with the other thing?
[01:10:20.467 --> 01:10:28.673]  So what happened with the other thing was, um, they, they took the truck, you know, it was brand new and they liked that, but my lawyer was smart.
[01:10:28.993 --> 01:10:31.574]  And, and this is maybe a good tip for all your listeners.
[01:10:32.415 --> 01:10:36.398]  Um, they have a certain amount of time before they can take your vehicle.
[01:10:36.998 --> 01:10:39.119]  If, um, you know, they don't file for it.
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.522]  So he said, let's just assume that, you know, the truck's gone.
[01:10:43.182 --> 01:10:45.824]  And then what happened was they didn't file in time.
[01:10:46.619 --> 01:10:53.690]  So, they, you know, under the law in Florida, you know, couldn't seize the truck after the, you know, they didn't lay claim to it after.
[01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.593]  But that was the whole plan, was to steal the truck.
[01:10:56.354 --> 01:10:56.634]  Right.
[01:10:56.855 --> 01:10:58.057]  Okay, now let's go back.
[01:10:58.117 --> 01:10:59.399]  What did they claim was in your wallet?
[01:11:00.792 --> 01:11:04.796]  Um, well, when the stuff fell out, I said, that looks like wax.
[01:11:05.117 --> 01:11:07.059]  And obviously I think that was crack cocaine.
[01:11:07.379 --> 01:11:08.600]  That's what it came back as.
[01:11:09.261 --> 01:11:12.844]  And, um, he said, uh, well, we'll take this to the lab and analyze it.
[01:11:12.904 --> 01:11:16.228]  And I said, well, I hope you do, because I don't know what the hell it is.
[01:11:16.488 --> 01:11:17.709]  You know, it's not mine.
[01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:21.373]  And, um, you know, I didn't even know it was being charged with.
[01:11:22.082 --> 01:11:23.583]  What were the looks on their faces?
[01:11:23.643 --> 01:11:32.050]  I mean, to understand true evil, was it like, I'm having victory over you, I get to hurt you little man, this is how I feel good at night?
[01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:33.711]  Total power trip.
[01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:41.517]  You know, like Hitler said, you give a man a uniform and he'll do unspeakable things.
[01:11:41.557 --> 01:11:44.399]  He'll do anything, come to that line.
[01:11:45.952 --> 01:11:47.133]  Something like that.
[01:11:47.193 --> 01:11:47.993]  God help us.
[01:11:48.354 --> 01:11:49.414]  You know, it was terrible.
[01:11:49.614 --> 01:11:51.015]  And then there's the follow-up to it.
[01:11:51.175 --> 01:11:53.416]  I got my truck back because they didn't file in time.
[01:11:53.456 --> 01:11:54.357]  And then it was even worse.
[01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:57.018]  I had to take that road because it's the major road.
[01:11:57.679 --> 01:11:59.039]  And I was driving down it again.
[01:11:59.179 --> 01:12:00.120]  And they were looking for me.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.102]  Because they were mad that they had to pay for all the days I was in impound.
[01:12:04.622 --> 01:12:06.063]  So they did another false arrest.
[01:12:06.944 --> 01:12:08.304]  Excuse me, false arrest.
[01:12:09.505 --> 01:12:13.247]  And what happened this time was they put me in a cell by myself.
[01:12:13.826 --> 01:12:24.893]  Called the original arresting officer and he came into the cell and started pushing with his chest up against the wall until I was cornered into the back of the cell like wanting me to hit him.
[01:12:25.233 --> 01:12:26.974]  And he kept saying, who paid for your truck?
[01:12:27.434 --> 01:12:28.695]  Who had to pay for your truck?
[01:12:29.256 --> 01:12:30.496]  Who had to pay for your truck?
[01:12:31.057 --> 01:12:42.664]  So two other officers arrested me, brought me to the same substation, took me out of the, you know, the cell they had me in with other people, put me in one in the back where there was no cameras or anything.
[01:12:43.348 --> 01:12:56.258]  And then they waited for the original officer to come, and then that's when he started, you know, pushing me into the back of the cell, you know, making me... And see, folks, this is all about his personal power, his weird little power trip.
[01:12:56.558 --> 01:12:59.580]  These are sadomasochists that get the job to do this.
[01:13:00.481 --> 01:13:09.108]  I mean, that's like the guy that was at the event last night, and I could tell he was totally telling the truth, driving down South Lamar, they pull him over, he admitted, he said, yeah, I had a tenth of an ounce of marijuana, I smoked marijuana.
[01:13:09.888 --> 01:13:10.228]  He said,
[01:13:11.369 --> 01:13:11.990]  It's just so far gone.
[01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:12.410]  My God, help us.
[01:13:40.956 --> 01:13:42.536]  I've asked myself the same question.
[01:13:42.596 --> 01:13:44.657]  And now I stay off certain roads.
[01:13:44.717 --> 01:13:45.457]  It's a shame.
[01:14:04.733 --> 01:14:05.814]  I could call you and talk.
[01:14:05.854 --> 01:14:07.375]  Well, you need to get out of Florida.
[01:14:07.395 --> 01:14:08.515]  You need to get out of Florida.
[01:14:08.695 --> 01:14:10.096]  It's a great center of evil.
[01:14:11.157 --> 01:14:15.440]  So, what ended up happening with him bumping into you with a chest?
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:22.144]  He wanted me to swing on him, but I had seen them, you know, literally beat a guy to where the dust flew off the floor.
[01:14:22.964 --> 01:14:25.906]  And, you know, they all jump in when that happens.
[01:14:25.966 --> 01:14:30.949]  When somebody comes in, you know, drunk or high or whatever, and they want to fight, you know, they all jump in and beat him.
[01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:33.791]  So, I didn't want the same thing to happen to me, so I just played dumb.
[01:14:34.494 --> 01:14:35.315]  And I said, I don't know.
[01:14:35.395 --> 01:14:37.919]  My attorney, you know, took care of the truck.
[01:14:37.979 --> 01:14:40.162]  I, you know, I just played total stupid.
[01:14:41.019 --> 01:14:44.441]  And I think it saved my, you know, could have saved some people.
[01:14:44.461 --> 01:14:47.203]  Oh, they'd have killed you and when they beat you to death, they'd have gone ahead and hung you.
[01:14:47.503 --> 01:14:50.885]  They usually get carried away, that's why you have a hangin' every day in most of these big jails.
[01:14:51.425 --> 01:14:53.706]  And then, you know, they beat you to death, it's part of the ego trip.
[01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:55.267]  It was scary out.
[01:14:55.307 --> 01:14:57.689]  Yeah, but they'd have beat you to death and hung you, yeah.
[01:14:58.209 --> 01:14:59.110]  Yeah, terrifying.
[01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:00.550]  It's all part of murdering people.
[01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:02.571]  I mean, that's what a murderer's gonna do!
[01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:04.973]  A murderer wants to murder and get away with it and become a cop.
[01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:09.193]  They used to be peace officers, now it's law enforcement, buddy.
[01:15:09.233 --> 01:15:12.375]  Now it's murder force.
[01:15:12.955 --> 01:15:20.119]  It's all over, and their mothers, their daughters, their sons will die of what they've been shot up with, the cancer viruses, they don't care.
[01:15:21.319 --> 01:15:34.827]  They don't care about their families, as long as they can go out and SWAT team people and dominate and kill and feed, and there's all the dumb, deadly do-right cops right next to them that just go along with it, because our job's so tough we're allowed to do this, and look, they admitted over a thousand people.
[01:15:35.629 --> 01:15:36.910]  I wish I could sit here, you know, and
[01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:06.433]  Your show helps me stay sane, Alex, and I want to thank you for that.
[01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:09.054]  Well, I appreciate you.
[01:16:11.116 --> 01:16:12.997]  Thank you for the call, and thanks for the story.
[01:16:13.017 --> 01:16:15.478]  God bless you and your family.
[01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:16.219]  Yeah, take care.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:23.403]  I'm speechless, and I wish the police were good.
[01:16:23.423 --> 01:16:27.386]  You know, in my film, Truth Rising, we show one Illinois
[01:16:28.436 --> 01:16:30.177]  Effingham's the next name of the town.
[01:16:30.277 --> 01:16:31.638]  No, that's not a Simpsons episode.
[01:16:31.658 --> 01:16:32.898]  It's really named Effingham.
[01:16:34.179 --> 01:16:46.985]  And we had scores of hours, you know, hundreds of police, hundreds coming up and screaming and yelling and demanding papers of these guys that walked across the country saying, investigate 9-11 and the Iraq War is not Christian.
[01:16:48.246 --> 01:16:50.166]  And, bay shalom.
[01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:55.109]  And we have hundreds of tapes.
[01:16:56.974 --> 01:17:00.979]  I mean, hundreds of tapes, hundreds of hours, and hundreds of police on the tapes.
[01:17:02.321 --> 01:17:03.102]  Let me say that accurately.
[01:17:03.122 --> 01:17:06.707]  We've probably got 30, 40 hours and hundreds of police on tapes.
[01:17:07.488 --> 01:17:09.710]  That's the only cop that's nice.
[01:17:11.704 --> 01:17:14.907]  But we put him in the film and everybody clapped for him and was amazed.
[01:17:14.967 --> 01:17:16.648]  Of course, you tell the guy he's smart, too.
[01:17:16.668 --> 01:17:18.550]  He walks up and, what are you guys doing?
[01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:19.191]  Oh, I got a call.
[01:17:19.211 --> 01:17:19.871]  You guys are up here.
[01:17:19.891 --> 01:17:20.872]  What are you doing?
[01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:22.954]  Oh, we're walking to D.C.
[01:17:22.994 --> 01:17:23.675]  And he's like, okay.
[01:17:23.975 --> 01:17:24.415]  Have a good one.
[01:17:24.435 --> 01:17:24.776]  See you later.
[01:17:25.296 --> 01:17:26.277]  He goes, oh, what are you protesting the war?
[01:17:26.317 --> 01:17:26.637]  Oh, great.
[01:17:26.818 --> 01:17:27.438]  See you later.
[01:17:27.478 --> 01:17:27.758]  Thanks.
[01:17:28.179 --> 01:17:28.819]  First Amendment rights.
[01:17:28.839 --> 01:17:29.160]  See you later.
[01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:41.933]  No man, the other ones, cops pull up and threaten to arrest them and scream at them and they did arrest them and then they found out where their kids lived and had the CPS take their kid and I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:17:41.953 --> 01:17:46.414]  We have these hardcore criminals just ruling us.
[01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:56.017]  Always getting away with everything, always winning, always getting worse and worse and now they're converting the whole society over into tattletales, more police, more control.
[01:17:58.237 --> 01:17:59.779]  And the general public just doesn't know.
[01:18:00.199 --> 01:18:01.120]  It's like gazelles.
[01:18:01.921 --> 01:18:04.583]  One gazelle gets grabbed by a lion, the others just run off happily.
[01:18:04.964 --> 01:18:09.868]  That's what the highways are, that's what the schools are, and they're just picking more and more of us off, feeding on us.
[01:18:16.815 --> 01:18:18.537]  I can't believe this had to happen to our country.
[01:18:20.018 --> 01:18:21.540]  I can't believe we turned into this.
[01:18:24.347 --> 01:18:27.709]  Folks, the news I've got here is all so insane.
[01:18:27.729 --> 01:18:35.194]  I'm going to go to Mark and Rich and a few other calls here in a moment, but let me just tell people in government this.
[01:18:35.214 --> 01:18:39.317]  I know you think you're God, but bare minimum, don't have your wife use a cell phone while she's pregnant.
[01:18:40.518 --> 01:18:43.300]  Bare minimum, don't give a cell phone to your daughter or son.
[01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:49.985]  I know you laugh at everything we say and you think it's cute to set us up and frame us or you're an idiot and don't know that other cops do that and you're a cop.
[01:18:50.925 --> 01:19:01.891]  But warning, using a mobile phone while pregnant can seriously damage your baby and then it goes into all the scientific studies that have been done and how bad it's hurting the babies.
[01:19:05.292 --> 01:19:05.772]  Oh man.
[01:19:11.335 --> 01:19:12.916]  I've got a report here
[01:19:14.329 --> 01:19:26.834]  that deals with how there have been hundreds of bombings the last five years in Iran.
[01:19:26.874 --> 01:19:36.178]  Police stations, dams, water treatment, schools, school buses, mosques, churches.
[01:19:38.035 --> 01:19:48.261]  And our government, the criminals, admit that they have a number three in Al-Qaeda commander running attacks in every state of the country.
[01:19:49.822 --> 01:19:51.163]  And I have news clips and everything.
[01:19:51.183 --> 01:19:51.983]  I didn't even play today.
[01:19:52.003 --> 01:19:53.765]  I mean, they're up on InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[01:19:54.105 --> 01:19:55.886]  On Prison Planet, they're in the News and Focus section.
[01:19:55.906 --> 01:19:56.746]  I didn't even cover that.
[01:19:56.786 --> 01:19:58.007]  I mean, that's how evil they are.
[01:19:58.407 --> 01:20:02.170]  They admit they're carrying out terror attacks in Iran, and they admit they're using Al-Qaeda to do it.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.340]  But then they tell the public that Al-Qaeda is Iran.
[01:20:07.821 --> 01:20:12.802]  It's just... It's so horrible.
[01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:14.662]  I mean, the government killed 3,000 people.
[01:20:15.742 --> 01:20:17.102]  And they're just going to go on doing it.
[01:20:17.142 --> 01:20:18.703]  Go on doing whatever they want to us.
[01:20:19.203 --> 01:20:20.443]  And they've done this to our economy.
[01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:21.303]  They've taken over.
[01:20:26.704 --> 01:20:28.524]  Iran busts CIA-backed terror group.
[01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:29.765]  Does our government deny it?
[01:20:29.785 --> 01:20:30.365]  They say no.
[01:20:30.465 --> 01:20:31.505]  That's just one of our groups.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.762]  Announcement follows Neocon General's urge for Bush Administration to support terrorist bombings in Iran.
[01:20:40.345 --> 01:20:40.865]  Here he is.
[01:20:40.905 --> 01:20:43.526]  Here's the Neocon General calls for terror attacks in Iran.
[01:20:43.566 --> 01:20:45.247]  You can go watch that video if you want.
[01:20:45.347 --> 01:20:45.968]  I mean, it's just...
[01:20:47.674 --> 01:20:48.595]  There's just no end to it.
[01:20:49.035 --> 01:20:51.557]  Immigration agency plans new family detention centers.
[01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:52.478]  Los Angeles Times.
[01:20:52.918 --> 01:21:00.484]  Federal government is accepting bids for up to three new family detention centers that would house as many as 600 men, women, and children fighting deportation cases.
[01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:03.606]  But when you read the actual federal documents, this is for U.S.
[01:21:03.646 --> 01:21:04.146]  citizens.
[01:21:04.667 --> 01:21:07.329]  They're just announcing the building of all these, and they've built hundreds.
[01:21:07.969 --> 01:21:14.314]  One's in Taylor, Texas, where they keep whole families, children, you name it.
[01:21:19.369 --> 01:21:20.129]  That does two things.
[01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:22.750]  It then gets people to feel sorry for the illegals, which they're doing.
[01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:25.071]  They're having their rights taken.
[01:21:25.091 --> 01:21:26.212]  That's wrong, which it is.
[01:21:26.612 --> 01:21:28.673]  But then they admit it's really for political dissidence.
[01:21:28.853 --> 01:21:32.734]  And that's their excuse and their cover for FEMA to build these family detention facilities.
[01:21:35.175 --> 01:21:39.517]  Look, I got Obama saying we eat too much and the government should license how much food we can eat.
[01:21:39.537 --> 01:21:40.537]  I mean, you can't make it up.
[01:21:40.598 --> 01:21:41.098]  It's AP.
[01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:44.859]  This is actually AFP, but it's in this article.
[01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:46.440]  You can read his quotes from Saturday.
[01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:48.248]  We're good to go.
[01:22:13.786 --> 01:22:17.389]  You know, people ask why we posted this story, why we posted the video of this.
[01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:23.353]  Prostitution and Max Mosley Nazi dungeon orgy was wife of MI5 officer.
[01:22:23.393 --> 01:22:28.356]  She was running the facility and was the one videotaping it.
[01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:31.018]  And they're only mad that this came out.
[01:22:31.158 --> 01:22:33.420]  All the major whorehouses are run by MI5.
[01:22:34.641 --> 01:22:37.983]  They not only make the money off of it, they then frame or set up whoever they want.
[01:22:38.303 --> 01:22:40.425]  How does the government run the whorehouse
[01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:45.772]  And then the women were dressed up in Nazi uniforms, and I'm not defending that.
[01:22:45.812 --> 01:22:48.114]  I mean, that's a popular genre of porn.
[01:22:48.174 --> 01:22:52.597]  No one accuses people of being Nazis that think it's sexy to have women in Nazi uniforms.
[01:22:54.278 --> 01:22:57.821]  I mean, that's a popular fetish.
[01:22:59.005 --> 01:23:02.307]  But the point is, is that they're setting this guy up.
[01:23:03.028 --> 01:23:05.650]  And then the media says, yeah, the government runs it all, but so what?
[01:23:05.670 --> 01:23:06.430]  They're allowed to.
[01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:09.192]  They wanted to destroy him, so now they have.
[01:23:09.212 --> 01:23:11.574]  Because they had a Formula One racing.
[01:23:12.515 --> 01:23:16.298]  I mean, my point is, is that that's who these people are.
[01:23:16.998 --> 01:23:17.759]  That's what they do.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.862]  And that's who the government is.
[01:23:22.742 --> 01:23:23.343]  Pack of scum.
[01:23:25.157 --> 01:23:27.559]  I'm going to give each caller one minute.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:32.044]  I know you've been holding patiently, but we've got to get to everybody here.
[01:23:33.185 --> 01:23:34.926]  Mark in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:23:35.967 --> 01:23:37.749]  Hey Alex, good to talk with you again.
[01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:39.751]  I'd just like to ask you one question.
[01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:42.353]  You seem to have a lot of sense about a lot of things.
[01:23:45.245 --> 01:23:47.486]  How do you develop common sense?
[01:23:47.826 --> 01:23:57.169]  I was married once and my wife died and she had a lot of common sense and we'd go to a party and she would find things going on at the party that I was oblivious to.
[01:23:57.689 --> 01:24:00.150]  And especially when it comes to dealing with propaganda.
[01:24:00.971 --> 01:24:02.151]  How do you develop sense?
[01:24:02.211 --> 01:24:04.572]  Just by reading different sources or what?
[01:24:05.632 --> 01:24:08.013]  Look, I don't claim to have all the sense in the world.
[01:24:08.593 --> 01:24:14.456]  More of it is listening to your inner voice, and the more you listen to it, the louder it gets, the discernment that we all have.
[01:24:14.856 --> 01:24:16.417]  Some of us have more discernment than others.
[01:24:18.138 --> 01:24:20.799]  I just, number one, you can't underestimate how bad people are.
[01:24:22.039 --> 01:24:24.881]  And you can't underestimate that bad people hate good people.
[01:24:25.541 --> 01:24:28.162]  They instinctively want to push you down, want to feed on you.
[01:24:29.203 --> 01:24:31.804]  So now if somebody plays mind games with me, I just want to never talk to them again.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.501]  I don't know.
[01:24:58.484 --> 01:24:59.644]  I mean, I don't know what to say.
[01:24:59.825 --> 01:25:01.805]  I don't claim to have the best common sense in the world.
[01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:03.986]  I've just studied how bad these people are.
[01:25:04.406 --> 01:25:07.087]  I look back a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, five years ago.
[01:25:07.687 --> 01:25:11.649]  A lot of it's my own personal journey having to learn that the government really is this bad.
[01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:14.550]  Having to learn that, my gosh, they really are incredibly bad.
[01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:17.451]  Well, I'm a useful idiot from way back.
[01:25:19.266 --> 01:25:19.946]  Man, I don't know.
[01:25:20.107 --> 01:25:33.594]  I mean, I just know that there's a whole other real reality that's scientifically constructed where the bureaucracies and the elites and the criminal guilds operate and do what they want, and then we're just down here with the dumbed-down mass of people who are evil.
[01:25:33.634 --> 01:25:35.135]  They're just not as smart as those above them.
[01:25:35.936 --> 01:25:43.680]  And evil's growing, and more and more people have decided to cheat and steal and kill and backstab, and everything's unraveling.
[01:25:45.953 --> 01:26:03.468]  There's still a lot of good in the world, but the only hope we have of turning it around is for good people to realize that there's evil going on and to stop denying it and get mad and get angry and stop being intimidated by saying who the police are and what they are.
[01:26:03.888 --> 01:26:04.088]  Yes.
[01:26:22.008 --> 01:26:23.049]  I mean, it freaks me out.
[01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:30.294]  I mean, I would never set somebody up who was just... pull somebody over and send them to jail and ruin their life.
[01:26:30.334 --> 01:26:34.037]  I mean, it's so alien and I'm not saying I'm a great person.
[01:26:35.733 --> 01:26:45.481]  You know, I mean, I have, you know, I get passionate thoughts and think about knocking somebody's teeth out, or I, you know, probably go overboard when somebody slights me.
[01:26:45.541 --> 01:26:48.603]  I'm going to, used to, I would restrict my dominating them and defeating them.
[01:26:48.643 --> 01:26:56.229]  Now I probably get into it too much, but it's because I used to be the other extreme of putting up with crap.
[01:26:57.089 --> 01:27:04.415]  And I just think, you know what, people think they need friends, think they need acceptance, think they need, you know, all this social stuff, and I don't.
[01:27:05.461 --> 01:27:08.003]  You know, and I don't even know what I'm saying right now.
[01:27:08.423 --> 01:27:14.467]  It's just, we really are a nation of spoiled brats that think that Hollywood's reality and that feel inadequate.
[01:27:15.147 --> 01:27:17.769]  And once people feel inadequate, they'll do anything to feel adequate.
[01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:26.495]  And people just need to know that you have the classy society that still have their morals, that think that everybody else is operating like we are, and they're not.
[01:27:26.735 --> 01:27:27.195]  They're not.
[01:27:27.816 --> 01:27:32.459]  The public is becoming evil, the government is totally evil, and we're in trouble.
[01:27:32.479 --> 01:27:33.599]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:27:34.764 --> 01:27:36.085]  I don't want to pontificate here.
[01:27:36.786 --> 01:27:38.808]  Dave in Ontario, you're on the air.
[01:27:38.868 --> 01:27:39.368]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:27:39.808 --> 01:27:41.009]  Oh, thank God I got through to you.
[01:27:41.049 --> 01:27:43.992]  My calls kept getting clipped on the 800 line.
[01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.754]  Alex, I got great news for you.
[01:27:47.075 --> 01:27:55.662]  It's not a total lost cause because with every equal action, reaction, shit, you know, there's an opposite reaction.
[01:27:55.682 --> 01:27:56.463]  You know what I mean, right?
[01:27:57.504 --> 01:27:57.764]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:58.527 --> 01:28:05.611]  Okay, people are ripe now for Greg Brayden, Lynn McTaggart, all those guys that do the consciousness experiment.
[01:28:05.791 --> 01:28:14.856]  With what I went through, I was held in custody here in Hamilton for eight years on completely fabricated charges of supposedly uttering a death threat.
[01:28:15.276 --> 01:28:21.640]  And the reason they could do that, because they throw you into a mental hospital, you wouldn't believe what went on up there.
[01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:22.380]  I believe it.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.901]  Yeah, you probably would.
[01:28:24.001 --> 01:28:26.281]  And then they can hold you indefinitely.
[01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:29.583]  I had a doctor tell my girlfriend, don't even get involved with this guy.
[01:28:29.623 --> 01:28:30.823]  He's never getting out.
[01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:36.765]  But I'm telling you, using the principles that I heard from Greg Braden in 05, I finally got out in January of 07.
[01:28:37.665 --> 01:28:38.126]  What did you do?
[01:28:38.186 --> 01:28:38.846]  I mean, boil it down.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.521]  Well, I just said I'm getting out.
[01:28:41.621 --> 01:28:42.582]  I said I'm done with this.
[01:28:42.682 --> 01:28:43.962]  I said I've been held long enough.
[01:28:44.042 --> 01:28:45.463]  It's time to move this on.
[01:28:45.563 --> 01:28:52.367]  It's time to get out and proceed with trying to blow the whistle on the corruption in the judicial system.
[01:28:52.767 --> 01:28:59.250]  I've talked to politicians, media, print, and TV for 13 years this went on.
[01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:01.091]  Alex and I can trace it back 30 years.
[01:29:01.171 --> 01:29:01.731]  Okay, well listen.
[01:29:01.751 --> 01:29:02.972]  Write me an article and send it to me.
[01:29:03.012 --> 01:29:03.873]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:05.713 --> 01:29:07.154]  I know of documented cases.
[01:29:07.174 --> 01:29:07.975]  The famous dentist.
[01:29:09.095 --> 01:29:12.738]  Uh, who was exposing government corruption, uh, in Kansas City.
[01:29:12.958 --> 01:29:14.339]  And he's been in over ten years.
[01:29:14.419 --> 01:29:16.540]  No judge, no jury, no crime, nothing.
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:22.884]  He is in a prison, forcibly drugged, in solitary confinement for, now it's gotta be more than ten years.
[01:29:23.645 --> 01:29:24.565]  And that's the new system.
[01:29:24.585 --> 01:29:25.326]  That's the new country.
[01:29:25.846 --> 01:29:28.087]  And with pleasure, they sit there and they slowly murder him.
[01:29:28.628 --> 01:29:31.550]  And he's reportedly almost a vegetable, just in the dark, drugged out.
[01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:32.671]  I think so.
[01:29:41.383 --> 01:29:42.604]  I mean, they're like a race.
[01:29:42.664 --> 01:29:49.890]  They just enjoy hurting people, and enjoy control, and enjoy injustice.
[01:29:50.110 --> 01:29:51.191]  You'll see them.
[01:29:51.211 --> 01:29:53.933]  They'll even go, oh, they'll just feel it when they're doing it.
[01:29:53.953 --> 01:29:55.975]  Oh, I'm winning.
[01:29:56.396 --> 01:29:57.817]  I'm hurting an innocent person.
[01:29:58.878 --> 01:29:59.298]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:59.598 --> 01:30:09.586]  And see, psychopaths and criminals get in government, and then they bring in more and more of their people, and get rid of the good people, and then more and more, it's nothing but the bad people, until it's nothing but bad.
[01:30:10.587 --> 01:30:11.828]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:30:11.848 --> 01:30:13.029]  Good, thanks for taking my call.
[01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:16.971]  I've talked to Mike a couple times about your money raising efforts.
[01:30:33.497 --> 01:30:40.339]  I've got two or three programs that are really good, and I know he had some health problems or something last week.
[01:30:42.159 --> 01:30:43.779]  I had health problems last week?
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:46.100]  No, Mike had gone to the doctor.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:48.621]  Listen, you're calling up and talking to one of my employees.
[01:30:48.681 --> 01:30:54.722]  I really don't want to have private discussions about one of my employees going to the doctor or ways of raising money on air.
[01:30:54.742 --> 01:30:56.102]  I don't think this is an on-air discussion.
[01:30:56.762 --> 01:30:59.103]  Okay, what would be my best approach?
[01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:03.885]  Well, you're talking to Mike.
[01:31:04.985 --> 01:31:06.846]  So, I mean, I've got a very small staff.
[01:31:06.946 --> 01:31:09.007]  I don't even have time to return most calls.
[01:31:09.767 --> 01:31:11.828]  I have to... Look, I appreciate your call.
[01:31:11.848 --> 01:31:18.672]  I'm not being mean to you here, sir, but I can't have some discussion about... I don't know who you are.
[01:31:18.692 --> 01:31:24.715]  I haven't heard what your thing is, but I know Mike was sick last week, so I'm not going to have discussions about one of my employees being sick last week.
[01:31:24.735 --> 01:31:25.935]  I'm just going to leave it there right now.
[01:31:27.096 --> 01:31:28.317]  Let's take one more call here.
[01:31:28.397 --> 01:31:29.377]  Nathan in New Jersey.
[01:31:29.797 --> 01:31:30.518]  New York, go ahead.
[01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:32.891]  Hey, Jones, this is Nathan Evans.
[01:31:33.431 --> 01:31:34.112]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:31:34.652 --> 01:31:35.252]  Nothing much, actually.
[01:31:35.272 --> 01:31:36.913]  I was waiting on the line, but they let me in.
[01:31:36.933 --> 01:31:40.495]  So I thought I might as well bring up two things I think are important.
[01:31:40.676 --> 01:31:42.617]  Try to keep it in a minute, because I don't want to get a big tumor.
[01:31:43.777 --> 01:31:46.059]  From holding my cell phone, one of my mother's down.
[01:31:46.079 --> 01:31:47.220]  Thank you for letting her in, of course.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:50.802]  But I just found out... See, people think that's secret code or something.
[01:31:51.402 --> 01:31:54.904]  You shot footage for Truth Rising.
[01:31:55.205 --> 01:31:57.346]  Your mom and dad and brother came to the showing last night.
[01:31:57.386 --> 01:32:00.108]  I didn't know they were coming, but I'm glad we were able to find them three seats.
[01:32:00.128 --> 01:32:00.448]  Go ahead.
[01:32:01.392 --> 01:32:04.554]  Well, my mother is actually down in Austin because I paid for her to go to see her mom.
[01:32:04.594 --> 01:32:05.234]  She didn't have any money.
[01:32:05.254 --> 01:32:07.796]  No, no, that's very sweet of her, and very sweet of you.
[01:32:07.816 --> 01:32:09.336]  She was really nice to meet.
[01:32:09.356 --> 01:32:09.737]  Go ahead.
[01:32:09.777 --> 01:32:17.941]  The main point is, I found out, and my mom didn't understand, but they're not feeding her for the last, going on now six days, because she's in a coma.
[01:32:19.022 --> 01:32:19.902]  And they're starving her.
[01:32:20.362 --> 01:32:22.463]  So they're trying to euthanize your grandmother right now.
[01:32:22.824 --> 01:32:23.824]  Yeah, and it's really hard.
[01:32:24.725 --> 01:32:27.166]  Because my mom told me when she was holding her hand,
[01:32:31.150 --> 01:32:41.461]  Well, your mother can demand she be fed, but I guess the bioethics board... Well, my mom's side of the family is very easily passe.
[01:32:41.521 --> 01:32:42.843]  They go along with whatever's said.
[01:32:42.903 --> 01:32:47.388]  So the grandfathers think it's okay and that it's normal for them to be that way.
[01:32:47.408 --> 01:32:48.349]  The doctors tell them that.
[01:32:49.667 --> 01:32:57.814]  Yeah, used to they'd let you be in a coma, you know, for a while before the doctors even recommended unplugging you or not feeding you, just to see if you'd come out of it.
[01:32:57.875 --> 01:33:03.520]  But now, obviously millions of Americans, you know, all the time get the flu.
[01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:05.061]  Over the years it's millions.
[01:33:05.421 --> 01:33:07.243]  And now, they don't give you fluids.
[01:33:07.283 --> 01:33:08.364]  You know, you're passed out.
[01:33:09.345 --> 01:33:11.367]  I mean, I've had the flu before and been passed out for a day.
[01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:12.808]  They don't give you fluids now.
[01:33:12.908 --> 01:33:13.489]  You die.
[01:33:13.529 --> 01:33:15.471]  They just say, no fluids, and then it's over.
[01:33:17.202 --> 01:33:18.262]  I'm sorry to hear this, Nate.
[01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:41.151]  Oh, just everybody donate.
[01:33:41.192 --> 01:33:44.495]  You know, we have plenty of listeners that can help, so just help if you can.
[01:33:44.635 --> 01:33:45.236]  $50, $25, whatever.
[01:33:45.356 --> 01:33:45.836]  Thank you, Nate.
[01:33:45.917 --> 01:33:47.458]  I'm donating $50, so I'll talk to you later.
[01:33:47.518 --> 01:33:48.339]  Nate, good to hear from you.
[01:33:48.359 --> 01:33:49.380]  We're going to end now, folks.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:50.221]  That's the end of the show.
[01:33:50.942 --> 01:33:58.490]  I had Ron Paul on today, and that rebroadcast will be airing in just a few minutes.
[01:34:00.224 --> 01:34:07.727]  I had him on, and so the rebroadcast is lined up so that you'll hear about two minutes of break, and then when we come out, I had Ron Paul on.
[01:34:07.907 --> 01:34:10.428]  Very powerful information he discussed.
[01:34:10.788 --> 01:34:13.709]  He explained that, no, the delegates are not going to make him the nominee.
[01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:15.630]  I told you he's been saying that.
[01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:17.411]  I'm just telling you what he says.
[01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:19.872]  And I was told I was lying, and it wasn't true, of course.
[01:34:19.892 --> 01:34:21.733]  That's how things operate.
[01:34:21.753 --> 01:34:22.333]  It's delusional.
[01:34:22.913 --> 01:34:26.355]  But I do support people taking over the delegate process and taking over the party.
[01:34:26.675 --> 01:34:29.197]  Two separate deals and then that was misrepresented, what I believe.
[01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.318]  He also got into government-sponsored terror.
[01:34:31.798 --> 01:34:34.460]  He got into the Trilateral Commission, being upset about him, and a lot more.
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:39.303]  God bless you all, and I'll see you back tomorrow live, 11 to 3.
[01:34:39.703 --> 01:34:41.824]  Here is the retransmission with Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:34:41.844 --> 01:34:49.008]  America has consumed more food than it has been able to produce, and it has now finally caught up with us.
