[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.210]  Rosetta Stone to expose.
[00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.071]  Ralph Winterud joins us in the final hour.
[00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:08.733]  He is Steve Watson.
[00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:20.559]  He is the head of Infowars.net and of course he also is the weekend editor of PrisonPlanet.com, two of my most successful sites.
[00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.020]  A few years ago I was in England.
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.463]  Not just bullhorning Parliament a day before they banned protests in that area.
[00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:28.764]  The birthplace of the Magna Carta.
[00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:33.348]  It was actually running me, but that's where it's enshrined, there in 1215.
[00:00:33.848 --> 00:00:41.915]  Then, before that, I was just filming in the streets of London and talking to people about, what do you think about what's happening?
[00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:43.176]  What do you think about these street cameras?
[00:00:43.596 --> 00:00:51.682]  And police would listen to what you had to say, and if they didn't like it, they'd walk over and say, give me your name, give me your ID, I'm putting you in a database, big long form.
[00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:56.475]  And then they'd say, turn your camera off, don't tape me, and you're not allowed to tape in London.
[00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:57.257]  I'd say, what's the law?
[00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:58.722]  And they just said, shut up!
[00:01:00.134 --> 00:01:03.555]  And start petting their billy clubs.
[00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:11.198]  They also have these minion Stasi police that are just citizens but have the common law right to arrest that really any citizen has.
[00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:14.059]  And they question this and boss this about.
[00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.681]  But now millions and millions of people have been put in the database.
[00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.242]  And they're everywhere.
[00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:23.743]  And they leave foreigners alone.
[00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:24.864]  They leave real thugs on.
[00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.484]  They've been told to.
[00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:30.105]  More and more thugs are imported to scare the British into submission.
[00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:34.167]  And this is secret police, just like in Cuba, or in Russia, or in Nazi Germany.
[00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:36.028]  And they just come over and say, where are you going?
[00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:36.548]  What are you doing?
[00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:37.728]  I want to see inside your pockets.
[00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:41.150]  They mainly, and it's in the news, they mainly target old people.
[00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.092]  Now there's another mainstream media report, the parents are about to sue, where this little girl fell into the water.
[00:01:48.072 --> 00:01:50.094]  A little child fell in the water, and then the brother jumped in.
[00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:51.255]  They were drowning, and they did drown.
[00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:55.839]  And it was right there on the edge of the river, and the police said, we don't do that.
[00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:59.163]  We are not authorized to help people under orders.
[00:01:59.303 --> 00:02:00.924]  Only a, quote, full officer can do it.
[00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:02.386]  So they waited and watched them die.
[00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.408]  And these people are robotic.
[00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:09.991]  And they have been, they're told, you advance the more robotic you are.
[00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:18.674]  So this happened to Steve Watson, and now you're arrested, you say you don't like hot food, you're put in a terror database as a child.
[00:02:18.874 --> 00:02:20.915]  That's mainstream news, you can't make this up.
[00:02:21.315 --> 00:02:22.096]  London Telegraph.
[00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.377]  I mean, it's all happening, it's all what you say, what you do.
[00:02:27.258 --> 00:02:28.899]  No society has ever been this controlled.
[00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.659]  Steve Watson, tell us what happened.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.140]  Hello Alex, how you doing?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.841]  Good my friend.
[00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:40.349]  Well, yeah, basically what happened to me was I was coming back into London on Sunday.
[00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:44.992]  I'd been to a festival to see Neil Young play, which was very good indeed.
[00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:51.737]  So I was in high spirits and basically walking with my girlfriend, deciding how we were going to get home.
[00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:56.820]  Came into Trafalgar Square, debating which bus to get home.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.244]  Suddenly, I hear this voice order me, it just says, you, stand over there.
[00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:08.693]  So, at first I thought, you know, they must be talking to somebody behind me.
[00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:22.181]  Turn around and there's two bright yellow jacketed police community support officers standing there and I just said, are you talking to me?
[00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:26.636]  And he said, just repeated it robotically, just stand over there.
[00:03:26.716 --> 00:03:27.057]  That's right.
[00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:28.718]  And they also cover their badges.
[00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:30.979]  It's all about not knowing who they are either.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.861]  They're starting that here in the United States.
[00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:35.743]  It's about letting you know you're the slave.
[00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:39.765]  That's why you take your shoes off at the airport to get athletes foot, why they yell at you.
[00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:41.807]  It's all about being trained how to be a slave.
[00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:43.928]  So yeah.
[00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:46.370]  And so I said, no, thanks.
[00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.771]  I think I'll just stay here.
[00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:52.434]  I was, you know, just stood near the bus stop.
[00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:54.799]  And he just repeated it again, stand over there.
[00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.563]  And this went on for about five minutes until I said to him, I'm not going to move until you tell me why you want me to move.
[00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:09.306]  Which, you know, they can't, they have to give you a reason, they can't just stop anybody and say, and order them around.
[00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:15.689]  So, this went on for a while and then he started saying, we can either do this the easy way or the hard way.
[00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.491]  Now, I don't know what the hard way is, but basically,
[00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:25.559]  He's just ordering me around, speaking to me as if I'm some kind of animal.
[00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.680]  Well, that's the new thing here.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:35.304]  If you ask police here, most of them, and I've been to Chicago, New York, all over, they'll just say, you want to do this the easy way or the hard way, people that ask questions get hurt.
[00:04:36.865 --> 00:04:37.385]  Go ahead.
[00:04:38.526 --> 00:04:46.830]  So anyway, after five minutes, he eventually said, I'm stopping you because I saw you adjust your shirt and put your hand in your pocket.
[00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.143]  Naturally I was a little bit baffled by this.
[00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:58.967]  Now Steve, I sat on park benches and rode around in buses and watched them all over harassing people.
[00:04:59.227 --> 00:05:00.228]  They now do it in DC.
[00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:01.529]  I just witnessed it there a month ago.
[00:05:02.947 --> 00:05:03.867]  You're a good-looking guy.
[00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:05.388]  I've seen some of your other girlfriends.
[00:05:05.408 --> 00:05:06.268]  I don't know this girlfriend.
[00:05:06.288 --> 00:05:07.128]  Probably good-looking.
[00:05:07.428 --> 00:05:10.509]  They hate good-looking, happy-looking people.
[00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:16.231]  It's just lowest common denominator, scum trolls out harassing people.
[00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:16.991]  And I've seen it.
[00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:20.252]  They go after people they're jealous of.
[00:05:20.312 --> 00:05:20.632]  Go ahead.
[00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:25.033]  So he started saying to me, have you got what's in your pocket?
[00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:27.234]  Have you got anything in your pocket that you shouldn't have?
[00:05:27.254 --> 00:05:30.054]  So I just said, like what?
[00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:32.075]  And he just went, you tell me.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.481]  And so I'm just saying, well, no.
[00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:35.261]  You tell me.
[00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:35.982]  It's your job.
[00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:36.642]  You've stopped me.
[00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:39.484]  You tell me what you think I've got in my pocket.
[00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:47.669]  And this went on for another few minutes until he... Until I just... I mean, this was at, sort of, 12.45am.
[00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.390]  It was quarter to one in the morning.
[00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:51.472]  So I just wanted to get home, really.
[00:05:51.512 --> 00:05:54.053]  I mean, it's still... It was in Trafalgar Square.
[00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:55.815]  It's still a busy area at that time.
[00:05:56.615 --> 00:05:57.396]  But I was tired.
[00:05:57.436 --> 00:05:58.436]  I just wanted to go home.
[00:05:58.596 --> 00:06:02.379]  And he... And... So I just... You know, kind of sped up the...
[00:06:03.868 --> 00:06:09.393]  Basically, if you don't give them ID or show them what's in your pocket, they just call the police.
[00:06:09.453 --> 00:06:11.955]  You have to wait half an hour for the police to come.
[00:06:27.904 --> 00:06:30.645]  And then if you don't cooperate with the police, they take you to the police station.
[00:06:30.685 --> 00:06:31.566]  So I just wanted to get home.
[00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:33.166]  So I said, look, I've got nothing in my pocket.
[00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:34.627]  Showed him what was in my pocket.
[00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:35.367]  Gave him my ID.
[00:06:35.848 --> 00:06:41.210]  He put a call in to the higher authorities to just to check that I wasn't a wanted felon.
[00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:50.954]  And all the while he's got this colleague who's, you know, stood a few steps away from me just saying, look, this is just procedure.
[00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.495]  You've done nothing wrong.
[00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:53.735]  You've got nothing to worry about.
[00:06:53.775 --> 00:06:54.916]  Just let him get on with it.
[00:06:56.722 --> 00:07:01.186]  And it's a procedure to go through airport scanners that scan your naked body now in mobile trucks.
[00:07:01.786 --> 00:07:07.671]  It's just a procedure to take your blood on the side of the highway from Austin, Texas to Chicago, Illinois without true warrants.
[00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:12.716]  It's just a procedure to have them put mercury in your child's vaccine as they have convulsions.
[00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.597]  I want to talk behind scenes with you, Steve.
[00:07:14.898 --> 00:07:15.218]  Stay there.
[00:07:15.238 --> 00:07:16.099]  We're going to Steve right now.
[00:07:20.012 --> 00:07:23.375]  I want to keep talking to you, Steve, and we'll come back on the foot... I don't want to waste any time here.
[00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:26.798]  I love, Steve, how you're... and we'll finish the main story when we get back.
[00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:32.983]  I love how you describe that you now have been put in this criminal database, and it doesn't matter.
[00:07:33.003 --> 00:07:40.389]  Everybody who gets stopped, millions, get put in it, and they're now stopping small children, photographing them, putting them in databases.
[00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:43.452]  Now they want to register knives after they took your guns.
[00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:48.136]  I mean, there's no doubt you have lawless, out-of-control government.
[00:07:48.696 --> 00:07:52.459]  I mean, I mean, what's your overall take as you write the article on why they're doing this?
[00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:53.419]  Then we'll finish the story.
[00:07:55.541 --> 00:08:00.204]  Well, I mean, it's just... It's a part of the overall system, really, isn't it?
[00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:17.596]  I mean, there's countless examples of... I mean, I'll give you some examples of this stop-and-search law, which is, you know, under the... It's brought in under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act in 2000, so they're using terror laws to stop people in the street, and some examples of how they've used it is
[00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:24.987]  Um, there was a woman who was stopped in Dundee in Scotland because she was walking on a cycle path.
[00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:31.430]  And they held her for four hours in the police station for trespassing on a cycle path under terrorism laws.
[00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:38.273]  Um, there was a 82 year old member of the, he's an MP, a Labour MP.
[00:08:39.053 --> 00:08:42.755]  He was detained under the Terrorism Act for heckling Jack Straw.
[00:08:43.895 --> 00:08:45.956]  He shouted nonsense, this was in 2005, as Jack Straw
[00:08:48.334 --> 00:08:55.156]  Defending the policy to invade Iraq at the Labour Party Conference.
[00:08:55.736 --> 00:09:06.298]  There's another example of an 11-year-old girl who was walking past a protest with her father who's stopped and searched under the Terrorism Act.
[00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:16.281]  I mean, these are all incidences of people minding their own business and being stopped and searched under terrorism laws.
[00:09:16.301 --> 00:09:17.841]  I mean, it's a part of
[00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:23.014]  Sort of merging crime and terrorism and eroding liberty in the process.
[00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:26.838]  You're absolutely right.
[00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:31.761]  And again, we've caught Blair with a secret deal to bring in unlimited foreigners.
[00:09:32.622 --> 00:09:33.782]  They harass citizens.
[00:09:33.802 --> 00:09:37.025]  They're now putting three-year-olds in criminal databases.
[00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:41.848]  They try to feed them hot curry at government schools if they cry and say it burns.
[00:09:42.188 --> 00:09:43.129]  Police are called.
[00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.211]  I mean, this is mass mental illness.
[00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:53.155]  And then these wannabe cops say, well, we're not authorized to save people drowning, so we watch children drown.
[00:09:53.936 --> 00:09:55.577]  I mean, and then they get rewarded.
[00:09:56.277 --> 00:09:57.638]  I mean, this is sick!
[00:09:57.678 --> 00:09:58.719]  This is mind control!
[00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:02.240]  Well, I mean, schools is another good example.
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.121]  You mentioned schools earlier.
[00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:16.948]  The article was about if children, I think it was, if they say, yuck, if they eat spicy food or something, then they're considered, you know, possible, they may possibly become racists, or they get special treatment at schools.
[00:10:17.268 --> 00:10:19.049]  Another one is the stop and search powers.
[00:10:19.901 --> 00:10:23.922]  Headteachers have now got the same powers as police to stop and... That's it.
[00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:24.322]  Here we go.
[00:10:24.342 --> 00:10:25.263]  Let's talk about that now.
[00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:26.083]  Let's talk about that now.
[00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:26.523]  Here we go.
[00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:30.865]  Okay, Steve Watson.
[00:10:32.005 --> 00:10:35.806]  Dear Behind the Scenes of Prison Planet dot TV viewers and InfoWars stream listeners.
[00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:44.489]  We were talking about how they're putting three-year-olds in criminal databases if they say yuck when the government school feeds them curry.
[00:10:45.754 --> 00:10:46.875]  Yuck, it's now not allowed.
[00:10:46.915 --> 00:10:47.615]  Police are called.
[00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:49.156]  I mean, we're not kidding, folks.
[00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:51.857]  This is maximum enforcement on the general public.
[00:10:53.378 --> 00:10:55.099]  Just absolute control.
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.061]  So finish up.
[00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:00.942]  He's there with the big form, filling it out on you.
[00:11:00.982 --> 00:11:05.164]  You're going in the National Database because you put your hand in your pocket at a bus stop.
[00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:05.565]  Go ahead.
[00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:13.389]  Yeah, well, he wasn't filling in the form until he asked me, do you want to wait
[00:11:13.976 --> 00:11:42.182]  fifteen minutes while I fill in this form and I just said no I don't want to wait fifteen minutes just fill it in and put it put me in the database of you know the rest of the innocent people yeah yeah he was offering you a copy he was going to fill the form and I had two forms oh yeah yeah they have to by law let's be clear uh... now just like the federal marshal said last year in the Denver Post they said look we're ordered with quotas to put people in it children a mother takes a photo out of plain window for the rest their lives are listed as terrorist
[00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.143]  Yeah, there was an article in the
[00:12:01.223 --> 00:12:11.786]  I think it was the Telegraph yesterday, because there were a load of figures released yesterday by the government, stop and search figures, and this is the other thing, they've separated it into stop and search, and stop and account.
[00:12:12.187 --> 00:12:13.167]  Now, now, that's not all!
[00:12:13.807 --> 00:12:26.491]  They also, even mainstream reporters, are grabbing cameras of all types, in rural areas, in cities, they'll come up to news vans and grab cameras, and then there's, they give them a form saying camera confiscated, and you don't get it back.
[00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:28.892]  I mean, it's, it's just incredible.
[00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:37.765]  Yeah, and the figures released yesterday showed that there's been a rise of one third in the amount of people stopped.
[00:12:37.885 --> 00:12:40.230]  It's now close to two... well, it was 06, 07.
[00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:47.334]  Two million people were stopped, which was a rise from 1.4 million the previous year.
[00:12:47.354 --> 00:12:53.697]  Now in New York last year, I saw the numbers, they went up from like 200,000 to 500 plus thousand random searches.
[00:12:53.957 --> 00:13:02.201]  And you'll be in New York, they'll block off the street, everybody get up the wall, this is in Endgame by the way, not in Endgame, in Truth Rising, my newest film.
[00:13:02.701 --> 00:13:06.783]  And they just cordon off the streets, search every person, search every car, no warrants.
[00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:07.444]  Go ahead Steve.
[00:13:09.265 --> 00:13:09.485]  Yeah.
[00:13:11.309 --> 00:13:19.117]  Most common reason for the searches that was given is they, you know, the police suspect they've got drugs or stolen property.
[00:13:20.218 --> 00:13:23.341]  And they're searching them under terrorism laws, so it's clear.
[00:13:24.272 --> 00:13:28.976]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[00:13:28.996 --> 00:13:36.663]  Well, when they have all these come to the local tattletale FBI meeting, you get there to fight terror, we got video of it, and they say, alright, is your neighbor smoking pot?
[00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:38.685]  Uh, they dumping garbage.
[00:13:39.126 --> 00:13:40.307]  Uh, they spanking their kids.
[00:13:40.587 --> 00:13:46.813]  Report this to us, you're now Deputy Minions, because there is no real terror that they're not staging.
[00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:55.231]  Yeah, and the government here continues to, you know, push for even stronger stop-and-search laws under the Terrorism Act.
[00:13:55.891 --> 00:14:00.132]  And at the moment, police can... They can carry out random searches.
[00:14:00.172 --> 00:14:05.334]  They designate an area, the chief officer does, and they can just go in there and carry...
[00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:10.290]  We just lost our connection to London.
[00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.691]  Oh, okay, good.
[00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:13.232]  You're back with us, Steve.
[00:14:13.252 --> 00:14:13.732]  Can you hear me?
[00:14:14.272 --> 00:14:14.432]  Yep.
[00:14:14.712 --> 00:14:15.913]  It's probably my SDN.
[00:14:16.013 --> 00:14:16.653]  It's been hellish.
[00:14:17.113 --> 00:14:17.534]  Stay there.
[00:14:17.554 --> 00:14:18.254]  We're going to come back.
[00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:21.716]  We're going to do one more segment, but this article's up on Infowars.net.
[00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:22.676]  It's very eloquent.
[00:14:23.096 --> 00:14:24.657]  Lots of links to what they're doing.
[00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:28.979]  I mean, Steve, this is already Orwellian to the max.
[00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:32.521]  This is already the prisoner on steroids, and it's only getting worse.
[00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.530]  Indeed, yeah.
[00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:44.875]  So we'll come back with a final segment with Steve Watson, then Ralph Winterud from Alaska is going to be joining us to talk about these private federal agencies.
[00:14:45.055 --> 00:14:46.556]  Letter of Mark is what they have.
[00:14:46.576 --> 00:14:52.559]  Just like the Queen of England would say to private shipping groups, go out and rob whoever you want, here's a letter of mark.
[00:14:52.639 --> 00:14:55.921]  Well, that's what most government agencies are now.
[00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:57.181]  We'll be talking about that.
[00:14:57.221 --> 00:14:58.302]  Steve Watson, stay with us.

[00:16:14.397 --> 00:16:17.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network!
[00:16:26.866 --> 00:16:30.729]  Folks, there are hundreds of articles in every major British and U.S.
[00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:40.876]  paper hyping war with Iran, saying they've got EMP weapons that destroy all our electronics in the U.S., nukes, deadly poison monkeys.
[00:16:40.896 --> 00:16:44.899]  They're claiming their little missiles that go a couple hundred miles are deadly.
[00:16:45.499 --> 00:16:47.040]  I mean, they're hyping everything.
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.842]  It is just, clearly the push for war is on.
[00:16:50.362 --> 00:16:55.346]  And throughout the week, we're going to be covering all of this in great detail with other key guests.
[00:16:56.974 --> 00:17:02.038]  Yeah, well, I'm in there now with everyone else, but out of the two million
[00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.393]  You know, the figures released yesterday out of the 2 million people that were stopped.
[00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:38.240]  It's interesting to note that in the same year only 221 were actually charged with terrorism offences.
[00:17:38.821 --> 00:17:41.323]  And after that fact, 40 were convicted.
[00:17:41.803 --> 00:17:51.933]  And we know from looking at the articles and reading about those 40 that they were basically all completely mentally retarded, basically.
[00:17:52.799 --> 00:17:58.801]  So there you have terrorism suspects right there, but they stopped 2 million, they convicted 40.
[00:17:58.841 --> 00:18:05.744]  Yeah, their favorite thing is to arrest registered schizophrenics who they can beat up and drug up, who they put on the news saying they did it.
[00:18:05.824 --> 00:18:12.366]  It's admitted, schizophrenics, or they will get people with 70 IQs, or folks with brain injuries, and that's every one of them.
[00:18:12.826 --> 00:18:19.869]  Now, in your article you list all the 84, 85, 80 year old innocent people walking down the street, they're being grabbed.
[00:18:20.069 --> 00:18:20.789]  Tell us about that.
[00:18:22.785 --> 00:18:33.255]  Yeah, I mean, there was an 82-year-old, in the break, there was an 82-year-old Labour MP called Walter Wolfgang.
[00:18:33.436 --> 00:18:43.285]  In 2005, he was ejected from the party conference for shouting nonsense when Jack Straw was defending the party's Iraq policy.
[00:18:44.246 --> 00:18:45.968]  He was detained under terrorism laws.
[00:18:47.475 --> 00:18:55.042]  There was an 11-year-old girl who was walking past a protest with her father, who was searched by police under terrorism laws.
[00:18:55.743 --> 00:19:05.292]  There was a woman who was held for four hours by police for walking, or trespassing as they called it, on a cycle path in Scotland.
[00:19:06.973 --> 00:19:09.794]  Uh, there's countless, there's countless.
[00:19:09.934 --> 00:19:23.260]  There was a woman arrested for a Times of London headline, I believe it was, two years ago, that said something bad about Blair, and the cops said, you're not allowed to have a newspaper that says that, and they arrested her.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:29.643]  It was, I think she was reading out names of soldiers who'd been killed in Iraq.
[00:19:29.783 --> 00:19:31.063]  She was just reading them out.
[00:19:32.952 --> 00:19:39.614]  That was deemed protest and she was detained under terrorism laws for reading a paper.
[00:19:40.034 --> 00:19:43.155]  Now again folks, this is England, this is the United States.
[00:19:44.075 --> 00:19:45.475]  This is clear tyranny.
[00:19:45.695 --> 00:19:46.796]  They're making their move.
[00:19:46.836 --> 00:19:47.996]  Steve, what do we do about this?
[00:19:49.676 --> 00:19:56.418]  Well, I mean, we've just got to... I mean, I've been getting emails telling me I should have just told them to, you know, to F off or whatever.
[00:19:58.792 --> 00:20:04.257]  No, no, these cockroaches would murder you on video camera and say you did it.
[00:20:16.864 --> 00:20:20.227]  Sound mind and not come down to the level that they want.
[00:20:20.407 --> 00:20:27.032]  Well the good news is the Brits are finally getting mad and once you get them mad it's hard to get once you get them mad things seem to change.
[00:20:27.052 --> 00:20:32.036]  I mean that's what I'm seeing in the news and talking to people they are starting to figure out that they're in a lot of trouble aren't they?
[00:20:33.677 --> 00:20:43.705]  Yeah I mean I got off lucky as well because we've got an article up today about a young man who was basically pulled off a train, hauled to the ground and
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:47.501]  Had six or seven submachine guns pointed at his head.
[00:20:49.161 --> 00:20:51.322]  Uh, he turned out he'd done nothing.
[00:20:51.642 --> 00:20:52.843]  He was just the wrong guy.
[00:20:53.343 --> 00:20:54.883]  Well, see, you're shocked by that in England.
[00:20:54.923 --> 00:20:57.124]  I mean, try being tasered to death every day for nothing.
[00:20:57.544 --> 00:21:04.166]  Soon they'll be murdering you everywhere, giggling, laughing, running around, drinking their fluoride, begging to be chemical attacked by their gods.
[00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:06.407]  Uh, Steve Watson, great job.
[00:21:06.427 --> 00:21:07.367]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[00:21:08.137 --> 00:21:08.598]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:21:19.943 --> 00:21:26.707]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?

[00:21:39.035 --> 00:21:41.736]  This product is available in powder, seeds, and oil.
[00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:45.939]  And a great report at InfoWars.net, some people are saying this is fear-mongering.
[00:21:46.239 --> 00:21:47.159]  It's just the facts.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:47.780]  They are
[00:21:48.462 --> 00:21:51.335]  Going and grabbing three-year-olds for saying they don't like food.
[00:21:52.133 --> 00:21:58.899]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:10.949]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones, with many more nutrients found in this incredible food source that the government does not want you to have.

[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.461]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[00:23:03.481 --> 00:23:08.682]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[00:23:08.902 --> 00:23:12.323]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[00:23:12.723 --> 00:23:12.904]  Yes!
[00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:27.781]  Thank you.
[00:23:52.666 --> 00:23:58.108]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:23:58.389 --> 00:23:59.689]  And we knew what to do.
[00:23:59.709 --> 00:24:01.470]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:08.113]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:24:08.733 --> 00:24:15.476]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air
[00:24:16.129 --> 00:24:17.270]  We're safe to breathe.
[00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:24.413]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:24:24.733 --> 00:24:25.173]  He had it.
[00:24:25.754 --> 00:24:26.814]  Mainstream media.
[00:24:27.535 --> 00:24:28.715]  Government cover-ups.
[00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:30.116]  You want answers?
[00:24:30.856 --> 00:24:31.737]  Well, so does he.
[00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:36.079]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:40.641]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24:42.373 --> 00:24:45.495]  Well, he has been fighting the New World Order for a long, long time.
[00:24:45.536 --> 00:24:46.716]  He's a radio talk show host.
[00:24:46.756 --> 00:24:49.739]  He also has a website and done a lot of research.
[00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:55.763]  And I've interviewed a lot of law experts, a lot of people that have been successful, actually found out what's real and what isn't.
[00:24:56.583 --> 00:25:01.827]  And I've been checking out Ralph Winteridge stuff for several years, and it's good info.
[00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.108]  It's what I separately have discovered.
[00:25:03.989 --> 00:25:09.113]  You have these thousands of agencies, state, local, federal, international, their private letter of mark.
[00:25:09.893 --> 00:25:13.736]  And the criminal government gives them a letter of marque to operate outside reality.
[00:25:14.137 --> 00:25:17.580]  That's why in the past, even military officers had to be commissioned by Congress.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:25.286]  Well, now you have the complete different operation with private mercenaries, like Blackwater Worldwide, who's now outside the U.S.
[00:25:25.346 --> 00:25:26.847]  coming in and going up against U.S.
[00:25:26.887 --> 00:25:27.308]  citizens.
[00:25:28.629 --> 00:25:35.332]  So I wanted to talk about his research into that, and then just some of the horror stories he's witnessed over the years, and things that are happening.
[00:25:35.913 --> 00:25:48.739]  You know, you hear about England, where if a toddler in a government preschool, they feed them hot sauce there, and if they don't like the hot sauce, that's there, then police come and they're put for life into a racism database and lose all, basically, their liberties.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.600]  You think that's crazy.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:51.661]  Well, it's meant to be crazy.
[00:25:51.721 --> 00:25:55.303]  It's meant to get everybody in the system, to get them in now,
[00:25:56.623 --> 00:25:58.288]  And it's the same thing here in the US.
[00:25:58.328 --> 00:25:59.872]  I mean, the government is predatory.
[00:26:00.414 --> 00:26:01.377]  It is coming for you.
[00:26:02.182 --> 00:26:02.582]  Period.
[00:26:02.622 --> 00:26:05.885]  Remember, this is a government that thousands of times marches U.S.
[00:26:06.025 --> 00:26:13.731]  and British troops into gas chambers, murders them in Sarin VX nerve gas tests, and then tells their families they died of the flu.
[00:26:14.132 --> 00:26:19.796]  This is a government that puts mercury in our vaccines, fluoride in our water, sodium fluoride, knowing it hurts us.
[00:26:20.237 --> 00:26:21.678]  We have our own documents on that.
[00:26:22.018 --> 00:26:27.503]  This is a eugenics super state whose number one job, we have our own documents, destroy the family,
[00:26:28.243 --> 00:26:29.404]  Well, I got started in this.
[00:26:29.424 --> 00:26:33.687]  I was in the telecommunications business and I have the largest privately held telephone connect company in Alaska.
[00:26:50.809 --> 00:27:01.034]  And, uh, when I went, uh, to bid this, why, uh, I found out that they had added seven million to a sealed bid, and I took it to the Supreme Court, and, uh, they said they couldn't see the problem.
[00:27:01.074 --> 00:27:02.995]  And I said, what in the world is going on?
[00:27:03.015 --> 00:27:06.256]  I mean, we got a couple of pieces of paper that a ten-year-old kid could figure out.
[00:27:06.296 --> 00:27:08.217]  They added seven million to a sealed bid.
[00:27:09.098 --> 00:27:11.119]  So I got around and I started doing research.
[00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:11.959]  But, but, hold on.
[00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:13.560]  Explain what that means for people.
[00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:20.211]  Well, what that means is, uh, I had a bid for $5 million and these other people had bid, uh, $1.5 million.
[00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:22.472]  They forgot to add in another $7 million.
[00:27:22.933 --> 00:27:30.676]  The bid was opened and, uh, all of a sudden, uh, they allowed them to add $7 million to a sealed bid that had been opened in public.
[00:27:31.996 --> 00:27:35.318]  And I took it to the Supreme Court because this is a real simple issue, right?
[00:27:35.378 --> 00:27:37.199]  I said, you know, the lawyer said, this is good.
[00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:38.039]  I said, what's good?
[00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:38.499]  It's simple.
[00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:40.380]  Go to the Supreme Court of Alaska.
[00:27:41.141 --> 00:27:42.443]  And they said we don't see a problem.
[00:27:42.743 --> 00:27:51.615]  So basically that was in the days before they just did no bid contracts and engaged in whatever fraud they wanted and paid a hundred times what something was worth to their buddy.
[00:27:51.635 --> 00:27:54.479]  I mean now it's just out and out total criminality.
[00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:55.180]  John McCain
[00:27:56.261 --> 00:28:05.708]  Goes to England, goes to the Rothschild Palace, raises a couple million dollars, every dollar is a felony, the news admits it's a felony, and he just says, go to hell!
[00:28:06.208 --> 00:28:11.972]  I mean, they're just completely lawless now, but please continue.
[00:28:12.912 --> 00:28:13.953]  Well, they were there then.
[00:28:14.273 --> 00:28:20.918]  The telecommunications is probably right up there with the absolute rottenest, most corrupt, because I had no idea
[00:28:21.482 --> 00:28:29.730]  When I got into that business, I had to pay up from anywhere from 2 to 5 percent of the bid to get the job.
[00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:33.614]  I was offered money to not complain about losing a bid.
[00:28:34.154 --> 00:28:34.895]  I had no idea.
[00:28:34.915 --> 00:28:43.984]  I mean, it was just rotten clear to the top, and finally the state of Alaska quit going to bid, just because of me, because I took them to the Supreme Court of Alaska a couple times.
[00:28:45.413 --> 00:28:47.234]  And that's what got me started doing this.
[00:28:47.374 --> 00:28:49.595]  By the way, just fighting for AXS TV.
[00:28:50.456 --> 00:28:52.317]  Payoffs to people.
[00:28:52.777 --> 00:28:55.779]  I've got people sent to prison for stealing money.
[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:58.521]  PIs following us.
[00:28:59.241 --> 00:29:00.482]  All sorts of threats.
[00:29:00.602 --> 00:29:02.243]  Cutting our show off cable.
[00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.204]  Literally turning the switch off.
[00:29:04.684 --> 00:29:05.565]  I mean, exactly
[00:29:06.885 --> 00:29:09.206]  I mean, it's just, it's so rotten.
[00:29:09.546 --> 00:29:10.586]  It's kind of like a tree.
[00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:13.027]  In fact, I have a tree in my backyard that we like.
[00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:13.707]  It's an oak tree.
[00:29:13.727 --> 00:29:14.467]  Thought it was healthy.
[00:29:15.027 --> 00:29:18.468]  All of a sudden, a big limb just fell off and there's carpenter ants all in it.
[00:29:18.908 --> 00:29:19.928]  That's basically us.
[00:29:19.989 --> 00:29:23.689]  We look healthy, but under the surface, we're just nothing but a big fat maggot.
[00:29:23.729 --> 00:29:24.110]  Go ahead.
[00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.291]  So, anyway, I really got involved in the research.
[00:29:28.371 --> 00:29:33.312]  I actually got the signatures and I ran under the Patriot Party, which was a break-off of Ross Perot.
[00:29:34.011 --> 00:29:38.033]  Unknowing that that was taken over by Farrakhan.
[00:29:38.794 --> 00:29:45.538]  And so anyway, I ran for governor of the state of Alaska, and I saw on the election results, I saw numbers go backwards.
[00:29:45.598 --> 00:29:46.378]  Can you believe that?
[00:29:47.419 --> 00:29:52.182]  They were scared spitless that I would just give... I mean, I wasn't going to win, but they didn't want the party established.
[00:29:53.142 --> 00:30:00.066]  But so anyway, I really got involved in this heavy because I am a guy that I want to do... I want to know what's going on.
[00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:00.987]  I want the real truth.
[00:30:01.738 --> 00:30:04.500]  Because I, and I was looking, I went all over.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.901]  I met with the Montana Freeman.
[00:30:05.961 --> 00:30:07.823]  I met with the Republic of Texas people.
[00:30:08.603 --> 00:30:11.646]  And, uh, you know, just to see what was really, what they were up to.
[00:30:11.746 --> 00:30:13.587]  I knew, uh, the Montana Freeman personally.
[00:30:13.607 --> 00:30:17.410]  Uh, and, uh, because back then I had money.
[00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.033]  And I got hooked up with Dan Metter, which is now deceased.
[00:30:21.253 --> 00:30:25.956]  And, uh, that's how I got, uh, involved in the, uh, IRS issues.
[00:30:26.257 --> 00:30:27.618]  And then Greg Pound here.
[00:30:27.718 --> 00:30:30.400]  The last year I got involved with the child custody issues.
[00:30:31.487 --> 00:30:33.349]  Before that... And that's what I want to talk about.
[00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:35.831]  That's what I want to talk about is two subjects.
[00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:39.614]  The horror stories of the child issues and how it's totally lawless.
[00:30:40.074 --> 00:30:40.594]  And I've been there.
[00:30:40.614 --> 00:30:41.155]  I've watched it.
[00:30:41.175 --> 00:30:41.755]  I've been to court.
[00:30:41.976 --> 00:30:42.796]  You're right.
[00:30:42.836 --> 00:30:43.897]  It's not even reality.
[00:30:44.558 --> 00:30:47.380]  And I also want to get into, first, these agencies.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.102]  For people to understand how illegitimate this government is.
[00:30:51.363 --> 00:30:53.925]  Well, what I discovered is we have no government.
[00:30:55.085 --> 00:31:00.629]  It's been gone a long time, because you have to understand the real basics of a constitutional republic.
[00:31:00.689 --> 00:31:02.811]  If it's of the people, by the people, for the people.
[00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:05.292]  There are some bright line issues.
[00:31:05.673 --> 00:31:08.355]  And by the way, before I forget to say this, the IRS is broke.
[00:31:08.735 --> 00:31:11.437]  It's absolutely, we are attacking it.
[00:31:11.477 --> 00:31:16.220]  But the bright line issues for a constitutional republic are quite simple.
[00:31:16.957 --> 00:31:26.820]  And these are tests that must be made, because anytime someone comes up to you, it's, by what authority are you authorized over my life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, including property?
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:33.462]  For a constitutional republic, if we're the sovereigns, number one, we must have a contract called our constitution.
[00:31:33.962 --> 00:31:37.923]  There's a limited delegation of power called, it's like a limited power of attorney.
[00:31:38.924 --> 00:31:40.724]  Okay, so this person comes up to me.
[00:31:40.984 --> 00:31:43.125]  Okay, your office, powers and duties,
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:50.082]  Must be created either by the Constitution or by the Legislature, defining what exercise, what part of it you're going to do.
[00:31:50.122 --> 00:31:51.883]  So number one, we've got to have the office.
[00:31:52.563 --> 00:31:53.503]  That's got to be created.
[00:31:54.104 --> 00:31:58.905]  Number two, to qualify for that office, there's only two ways you get there.
[00:31:59.005 --> 00:32:09.069]  You must have a certificate of election from the qualified electors, or number two, you must have a civil commission of which the signature is the evidence of the appointment.
[00:32:09.109 --> 00:32:11.689]  That was established back in Marbury v. Madison in 1803.
[00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:12.190]  So now we've got
[00:32:13.772 --> 00:32:14.993]  Two ways to get to the office.
[00:32:15.674 --> 00:32:25.644]  Number three, to enter that office, then, you, number one, must have an oath of office, but it's an oath of office as a public officer, which means you have discretion.
[00:32:25.864 --> 00:32:30.329]  Not, they just do oath of office, that's for employees, which I'll get to in a minute.
[00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.515]  And then, when you get into this office, after you've done the oath of office as a public officer,
[00:32:37.341 --> 00:32:47.524]  To keep you honest, it was set up to have what's called a performance bond, which is known as official bond, where you must put up your personal asset to make sure you're honest.
[00:32:48.585 --> 00:32:51.506]  Now, in Alaska, we still have all the official bonds on the books.
[00:32:51.546 --> 00:32:54.327]  Would you like to guess how many official bonds we have in Alaska?
[00:32:55.007 --> 00:32:55.347]  None.
[00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:58.568]  You got it, because we had no public officers.
[00:32:59.829 --> 00:33:03.850]  Now, so once that was established, the test that I came to, and
[00:33:04.517 --> 00:33:23.468]  Over the years with child custody in the IRS, and the President of the Senate, Lida Green, she's not going to run anymore, but she's President of the Senate out of Juneau, Alaska, said with agencies, this is right out of her office, we fund them, we do not control them, and they have no oversight.
[00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:32.433]  Now, when you go check... Let me stop you, just an example for laymen out there, Ralph Winterwood, this is so important, this info is dead on, folks, listen carefully.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.680]  LCRA.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.401]  Private group with quasi-governmental power.
[00:33:37.861 --> 00:33:39.742]  They own most of the water in Central Texas.
[00:33:40.062 --> 00:33:41.062]  They have SWAT teams.
[00:33:41.082 --> 00:33:42.842]  They have cameras all over Austin.
[00:33:43.223 --> 00:33:44.403]  They surveil us all.
[00:33:44.903 --> 00:33:46.083]  They arrest people.
[00:33:46.183 --> 00:33:47.284]  They surveil people.
[00:33:47.804 --> 00:33:51.445]  They tried to, before I even knew who they were,
[00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:57.652]  About 12 years ago, I said to the local radio station, we want to spend a bunch of money advertising.
[00:33:57.712 --> 00:33:58.453]  They don't advertise anything.
[00:33:58.473 --> 00:33:59.794]  It was just these public service announcements.
[00:34:00.055 --> 00:34:01.336]  But we don't like Alex Jones.
[00:34:01.376 --> 00:34:02.598]  We don't want it on his show.
[00:34:03.038 --> 00:34:05.101]  And we don't want him talking about us.
[00:34:05.681 --> 00:34:09.686]  Well, the program director and actually the manager said, I've never heard of anything like this.
[00:34:10.347 --> 00:34:12.689]  But they said they're going to advertise, but don't talk about them.
[00:34:12.729 --> 00:34:13.829]  Did you say something about them?
[00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.831]  And I said, no, I don't even know who the LCRA is.
[00:34:16.871 --> 00:34:17.832]  That's why I found out.
[00:34:18.232 --> 00:34:19.993]  I mean, that's how diabolical.
[00:34:20.073 --> 00:34:24.156]  I didn't even know who they were, and they were trying to make payments to keep me quiet.
[00:34:24.196 --> 00:34:25.157]  I mean, do you understand this?
[00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:28.959]  I mean, this folks, it's so shot, you have no idea.
[00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:34.022]  They've got the force, they've got the troops, they've got the machine guns, and they rule you!
[00:34:34.042 --> 00:34:35.583]  And they're going to take your property.
[00:34:35.623 --> 00:34:36.264]  Go ahead, Ralph.
[00:34:37.222 --> 00:34:44.964]  So now, I've tracked this all the way back, and right after the Civil War, they did some very nefarious things.
[00:34:45.804 --> 00:34:51.245]  They usurped the executive and judicial power, the executive power of the United States.
[00:34:52.186 --> 00:34:56.447]  Fifty-nine years later, finally, the Supreme Court got around and restored part of that.
[00:34:56.507 --> 00:35:02.828]  But what they did is they set up what's called independent establishment, which means they're totally outside the government.
[00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:06.149]  And their reason was, well, they'll be free of all political
[00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.572]  Uh, people that are working on it, and they'll be a great thing.
[00:35:09.592 --> 00:35:11.454]  They're called independent agencies today.
[00:35:12.094 --> 00:35:15.197]  So what these things are, they sit outside of our government.
[00:35:16.158 --> 00:35:22.343]  And what they do is Congress or the state gives marching orders to these agencies.
[00:35:23.764 --> 00:35:31.611]  Now these agencies, because they are, uh, foreign, they're, they're, uh, they're actually, uh, uh, you can call them foreign and domestic enemies.
[00:35:32.231 --> 00:35:32.752]  What they do,
[00:35:33.413 --> 00:35:49.740]  To rule us then, Congress said we are going to fund these things, and they will publish in the Federal Register, which is the federal newspaper, to give us legal notice, what they are going to do to us.
[00:35:51.016 --> 00:35:56.100]  And in that federal register, these agencies are operating under rules and regulations.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.142]  Rules are government and regulations is us.
[00:35:58.442 --> 00:36:00.864]  And they are literally letters of mark.
[00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:08.570]  The Imperium gives them seal to engage in piracy, to engage in forfeiture against the slave enemy.
[00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:14.034]  Just like when the Soviets took over, they called everyone rebels and then gave letters of mark to their agents.
[00:36:14.615 --> 00:36:16.456]  It is, you are the enemy of the government.
[00:36:16.656 --> 00:36:18.898]  They have set forth armies to eat out your substance.
[00:36:19.158 --> 00:36:19.759]  We'll be right back.
[00:36:20.439 --> 00:36:21.820]  I want to talk to him behind the scenes.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.781]  I want to get going.
[00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:24.602]  Bring him up, John.
[00:36:24.862 --> 00:36:25.542]  Ralph Winterud.
[00:36:26.563 --> 00:36:26.723]  Yes.
[00:36:26.883 --> 00:36:28.784]  We're still on air, just for the internet audience.
[00:36:29.044 --> 00:36:29.925]  I don't want to waste any time.
[00:36:29.965 --> 00:36:34.207]  We'll come back and get into where you were on the other side, so it's congruent.
[00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:47.275]  But right now, I want to talk to you about... We'll shift gears back into the whole operation they're running, but right now, let's go ahead and start getting into the horror stories with CPS.
[00:36:48.476 --> 00:36:48.716]  Okay.
[00:36:52.506 --> 00:36:52.966]  Go ahead, Ralph.
[00:36:53.006 --> 00:36:54.006]  We're live on air right now.
[00:36:55.267 --> 00:37:01.969]  Okay, well, in these, I was contacted by Greg Pound out of Florida.
[00:37:02.869 --> 00:37:10.892]  And he is, him and I have been working together to get to the bottom of this, of how and what they're doing.
[00:37:10.932 --> 00:37:14.773]  Because he had four children at the time, and one of them was bitten by a dog.
[00:37:15.773 --> 00:37:17.214]  Just not seriously.
[00:37:17.294 --> 00:37:18.634]  And of course, what do you do?
[00:37:18.654 --> 00:37:19.294]  You dial 911.
[00:37:19.515 --> 00:37:20.895]  They took the child to the hospital.
[00:37:21.445 --> 00:37:24.227]  Uh, the next thing you know, they have taken all four of his children.
[00:37:25.247 --> 00:37:30.630]  Now, the, and they showed up with the cops and they took them under force of arms and they took all of his children.
[00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:37.834]  The very two first hearings, uh, that they went to, he was denied any right to enter any evidence.
[00:37:39.034 --> 00:37:45.137]  And once they closed that door, then they do step two is they go into what's called the case plans.
[00:37:45.497 --> 00:37:47.879]  And this is where everybody is sucking off the hind tip.
[00:37:47.899 --> 00:37:48.319]  That means.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.340]  The government is getting money.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.861]  The psychiatrist is getting money.
[00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:54.141]  The dentist is getting money.
[00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:55.361]  Everybody is getting money.
[00:37:55.421 --> 00:37:58.542]  The lawyers have an allocation of money that they can spend.
[00:37:59.142 --> 00:38:05.563]  So they're all getting this money, and the only objective for him was to, are you going to do the case plan?
[00:38:05.663 --> 00:38:07.043]  So he had to go to anger management.
[00:38:07.083 --> 00:38:10.604]  He had to go in and confess that he had done domestic violence.
[00:38:10.724 --> 00:38:15.945]  Yeah, this is guilty until proven innocent, and then when you sign that, you agree to guilt, and now it's over.
[00:38:16.806 --> 00:38:29.235]  Well, they actually set up, and it's right in, and this is where we started to get this exposed, they actually, in these child protectives, they actually have a group where you, they're actually in there, they're in there to punish you.
[00:38:29.255 --> 00:38:30.256]  It actually says this.
[00:38:30.836 --> 00:38:46.228]  They're in there to punish you, and it's composed of the cops and all of these agency people, people that don't even know anything about you, and all of a sudden they're in control of your life, and they're going to make you do these certain things because you are guilty until proven innocent, and there is no way to prove yourself innocent.
[00:38:46.408 --> 00:38:48.390]  And of course, it's filled with pedophiles.
[00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:56.596]  Just filled with child rapers or just lazy scum that house five or six kids and they beat them, don't feed them enough, and it's all come out.
[00:38:56.876 --> 00:38:59.779]  Five times more likely than any other group to abuse children.
[00:39:00.379 --> 00:39:07.165]  I've gone and covered these events and they're all these demonic little nelly pigmen in uniforms.
[00:39:07.625 --> 00:39:09.807]  I mean, just the most sick filth you've ever seen.
[00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:13.606]  Well, this is where they get around and you discover this.
[00:39:13.706 --> 00:39:21.329]  Well, this is the case where they sent, even the CBS worker went to jail for filing false reports, but they said, we don't care, you'll never see your kids again.
[00:39:21.389 --> 00:39:22.330]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:33.875]  Yeah, and in Greg Pounds, she filed 26 false reports, and they got around and whitewashed it, and she didn't spend any time in jail, and they didn't do anything about it.
[00:39:33.915 --> 00:39:35.235]  But she's dead now, isn't she?
[00:39:35.816 --> 00:39:37.336]  No, no, no, no, she's still out there.
[00:39:37.456 --> 00:39:39.157]  It was just a young gal.
[00:39:39.616 --> 00:39:43.897]  This was somebody else and another CPS went to jail and then committed suicide or something.
[00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:45.117]  God, I mean, imagine!
[00:39:45.137 --> 00:39:54.459]  This is a different one, but what they do then is, we found this, and the thing is how they protect these pedophiles, people do not know that.
[00:39:54.519 --> 00:40:01.700]  Anytime you take a young child to the hospital for any issue, they get around and send over a report to the child custody folks.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:08.901]  In the Florida regulations, if you are a child provider, foster care,
[00:40:09.665 --> 00:40:15.913]  You are, the hospital is not to report what's going on, so therefore they can be sexually abused.
[00:40:15.953 --> 00:40:18.797]  Yeah, stay there, stay there, because this is bifurcated.
[00:40:18.817 --> 00:40:24.484]  We're going to go back into what agencies are and then later connect back in to the rest of the story with what you're saying now.
[00:40:24.504 --> 00:40:26.247]  Ralph, here we go, full radio show now.
[00:40:35.529 --> 00:40:37.832]  Coming up, Ralph Winterud's going to get into CPS.
[00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:49.024]  At every hospital, every clinic, they upload with computers by law to the local health department that carries out the eugenics operation under the federal charter.
[00:40:50.185 --> 00:40:51.425]  They report on your child.
[00:40:51.505 --> 00:40:53.266]  Neighbors dog bite, some kids are gone.
[00:40:54.086 --> 00:40:58.607]  Child breaks their finger playing peewee football in front of witnesses, CPS is coming, doesn't matter.
[00:40:59.207 --> 00:41:12.850]  Then, once they get them in the pedophile guild clutches, and we're not joking when I mean that, then the hospitals are not allowed to report on sexual or physical abuse, and that's why they're five times more likely in fed zone numbers to abuse children.
[00:41:13.131 --> 00:41:14.611]  This is the sicko force.
[00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:16.993]  I mean, this is a guild of pedophiles.
[00:41:18.174 --> 00:41:23.258]  But the globalists do it because they want to break up families, so they contract with the pedophiles to run this.
[00:41:23.758 --> 00:41:28.282]  I mean, every state they've been caught, Texas, Florida, with pedophiles running the whole system.
[00:41:28.322 --> 00:41:31.325]  It's mainstream news, but the hell force is just increasing.
[00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:32.906]  But I want to get back into that later.
[00:41:33.206 --> 00:41:35.288]  Right now, Ralph, get into what these agencies are.
[00:41:36.509 --> 00:41:42.534]  Well, what I finally discovered, Dan, when they meet none of the qualifications of a public officer that has discretion,
[00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:48.693]  Or they meet none of the qualifications of what's called an officer of the United States or an inferior officer of the United States.
[00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:50.575]  They're all employees.
[00:41:51.355 --> 00:41:52.796]  Now herein lies the danger.
[00:41:53.196 --> 00:41:54.237]  You can't fire them.
[00:41:54.857 --> 00:41:55.998]  They don't work for us.
[00:41:56.338 --> 00:41:57.699]  You can't hold them accountable.
[00:41:57.879 --> 00:41:59.860]  It's almost impossible to sue them.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.643]  Now if they all look like they had turbines like out of Iraq or Iran, we'd know what they were.
[00:42:06.504 --> 00:42:09.866]  But they're sitting out here and they're funded by the state or by the feds.
[00:42:10.786 --> 00:42:12.126]  And they're all employees.
[00:42:12.467 --> 00:42:13.887]  And that's called ministerial duties.
[00:42:13.987 --> 00:42:15.607]  They hold no public office.
[00:42:15.627 --> 00:42:16.648]  They have no discretion.
[00:42:16.688 --> 00:42:19.568]  They are mandated to work by the rules and regulations.
[00:42:19.608 --> 00:42:22.489]  That's the only thing that holds them accountable.
[00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:24.310]  They are no part of a government.
[00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.290]  We have no constitutional republic.
[00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:30.191]  If people use this word agency, it's got nothing to do with us.
[00:42:30.512 --> 00:42:31.932]  I've researched out the
[00:42:32.754 --> 00:42:34.515]  Uh, police, like in Alaska, they're troopers.
[00:42:34.555 --> 00:42:35.596]  They're paramilitary.
[00:42:35.656 --> 00:42:37.457]  I heard this guy get up and testify.
[00:42:37.477 --> 00:42:39.999]  He says, we're paramilitary, which means we're outside the government.
[00:42:40.019 --> 00:42:41.060]  They're just like Blackwater.
[00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:06.095]  This is so far-fetched they won't even consider the truth, the facts.
[00:43:07.276 --> 00:43:15.201]  I sit in this court and I listen to him describe their definition of force, the Alaska State Troopers, is force up until you submit.
[00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:17.983]  And he said we operate under the use of force continuum.
[00:43:18.503 --> 00:43:20.265]  Level 1, officer present.
[00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:22.246]  Level 2, orders, our military orders.
[00:43:22.719 --> 00:43:24.820]  Level 3 is our soft hand techniques.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.361]  Level 4 is pepper spray.
[00:43:26.801 --> 00:43:31.383]  The next level up is we go to batons and then we go up to guns.
[00:43:31.884 --> 00:43:35.806]  And that's why worse than Abu Ghraib, torture happens everywhere.
[00:43:35.826 --> 00:43:41.929]  I have video in Martial Law, my film, with him breaking men and women's arms for not getting up off a sidewalk.
[00:43:42.429 --> 00:43:51.835]  And then now, in Canada, they say if they catch you without a ticket on a train or a bus, it says you are tasered for punishment, and the police chief came out and said, yes, we now punish you.
[00:43:51.855 --> 00:43:53.276]  I mean, that's Judge Dredd.
[00:43:53.336 --> 00:43:54.716]  They now punish you.
[00:43:55.837 --> 00:43:56.958]  Well, they don't work for us.
[00:43:57.018 --> 00:44:01.801]  And right out of the Wasilla police manual I got, it says we are professionals at making citizens arrest.
[00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:04.062]  They have no police power.
[00:44:04.082 --> 00:44:05.363]  It says they have no police power.
[00:44:06.428 --> 00:44:11.130]  They're hired guns, just like black... By the way, these new auxiliary police in England say the same thing.
[00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:17.532]  They say, we're authorized under English common law, but see, then they tell us we can't exercise our common law.
[00:44:18.873 --> 00:44:23.195]  That's true, and the other part of this is, see, they can beat the living daylights out of us.
[00:44:23.735 --> 00:44:26.956]  If you touch one of them, you can be charged with a crime.
[00:44:27.438 --> 00:44:28.079]  You just touch it.
[00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:28.799]  Just take your finger.
[00:44:28.819 --> 00:44:29.880]  I've already tried these things.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.602]  It's a wonderland for control freak cowards.
[00:44:32.622 --> 00:44:35.204]  They get to rape, kill, abuse, rape children.
[00:44:35.224 --> 00:44:46.152]  I mean, folks, when you read about the Texas Youth Commission, where every facility was raping children, making films, having public rape parties, public gladiatorial fights.
[00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:48.834]  I mean, just something out of a nightmare.
[00:44:49.474 --> 00:44:51.816]  It's just... I call them the Hell Force, Ralph.
[00:44:51.876 --> 00:44:53.878]  I mean, the Hell Force is among us.
[00:44:55.185 --> 00:44:56.226]  Well, let me tell you this.
[00:44:56.566 --> 00:45:09.095]  Right out of the Federal Register, first of all, there's an Act of Congress, I think it's 97 or 98, under Clinton, that says they are going to average out the three-year baseline of kids to adopt.
[00:45:09.135 --> 00:45:15.280]  There's mandatory requirements for the feds for, if you're in the state program, to get money to adopt.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.862]  And they give $4,000 for the healthy ones, $2,000 for the crippled ones.
[00:45:21.793 --> 00:45:28.295]  And that's above the baseline, so every year the baseline keeps increasing, so that's an automatic self-destruct for our families.
[00:45:29.016 --> 00:45:43.061]  And number two in the Federal Register... Let me be clear, the bounty for the number of children that must be kidnapped is increasing, and they just have a cold-blooded bounty, and they go after nice families, because CPS has found, why trash will blow your head off?
[00:45:43.641 --> 00:45:44.001]  Okay?
[00:45:44.781 --> 00:45:48.163]  You know, they don't like messing with the tough types or criminal types.
[00:45:48.463 --> 00:45:51.984]  They like the nice little family that keeps thinking, well, I'm innocent.
[00:45:52.404 --> 00:45:53.645]  I'll get my child back someday.
[00:45:53.665 --> 00:45:56.686]  And the fat pedophile says, yeah, you'll get him back someday.
[00:45:56.706 --> 00:46:02.528]  And you can just see him, big, fat, disgusting, demonic, child-raping, filled from hell.
[00:46:03.048 --> 00:46:07.150]  The last, what, five, six heads of the CPS in Florida have been child rapists.
[00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:09.891]  You must be a convicted child rapist to get a job.
[00:46:10.011 --> 00:46:11.131]  We're on the march to the empire.
[00:46:11.152 --> 00:46:11.952]  Let me talk to Rennerud again.
[00:46:12.512 --> 00:46:13.953]  Wynnerud, I'm sorry, I keep interrupting you.
[00:46:13.993 --> 00:46:15.494]  Everything you say makes me so mad.
[00:46:15.534 --> 00:46:18.076]  These bastards, murdering scumbag.
[00:46:18.256 --> 00:46:19.557]  They also kill a lot of the kids.
[00:46:20.218 --> 00:46:21.839]  When we come back, let's get into CPS.
[00:46:21.859 --> 00:46:27.824]  But right now, continue with these out-of-control rogue agencies and the few ways you've found to stop these bastards.
[00:46:28.904 --> 00:46:36.530]  Well, I'm going to be getting back into child custody, but let me just make one more comment there that's absolutely astounding.
[00:46:37.051 --> 00:46:40.093]  In the Federal Register, and by contract, the YMCA,
[00:46:40.615 --> 00:46:45.138]  Which has a contract in Pinellas County, operating under another name.
[00:46:45.938 --> 00:46:53.163]  They actually can receive federal money, and one out of every 25% of the children they pick up can be abused.
[00:46:53.903 --> 00:46:55.104]  Sexually abused or whatever.
[00:46:56.385 --> 00:46:57.385]  Imagine, one out of 20!
[00:46:57.465 --> 00:46:59.166]  There's no zero tolerance.
[00:46:59.206 --> 00:47:02.569]  So we can take every, we can legally take one out of every 20.
[00:47:03.009 --> 00:47:08.312]  Now of course behind that is all the one... That's like a letter of Mark with a slave ship saying how many of your slaves can die.
[00:47:08.812 --> 00:47:09.233]  Go ahead.
[00:47:10.149 --> 00:47:19.352]  And they have a mandatory, it's over 300, just to not one county that have to be adopted out, or otherwise the YMCA could lose up to 10%, about $10 million.
[00:47:19.392 --> 00:47:20.812]  So what do you think they're going to do?
[00:47:20.852 --> 00:47:28.134]  They're going to go out and nab kids, and you read their requirements, and there is no circumstance to where they cannot take a child.
[00:47:28.866 --> 00:47:31.348]  If any accident happens, they say, well, you should have been there.
[00:47:31.388 --> 00:47:32.249]  You were too far away.
[00:47:32.489 --> 00:47:33.790]  Ralph, let me tell you a story.
[00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:34.730]  There was this family.
[00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:36.412]  Poor people.
[00:47:36.432 --> 00:47:37.953]  He was an auto mechanic, whatever.
[00:47:38.533 --> 00:47:39.914]  The poor woman was ignorant.
[00:47:39.974 --> 00:47:42.236]  She'd gone in and had one baby, quote, on welfare.
[00:47:42.276 --> 00:47:44.438]  They took that one, and they made stuff up.
[00:47:44.458 --> 00:47:47.100]  The next time I show up, they're taking her next baby.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.241]  Blond-haired, blue-eyed baby.
[00:47:49.261 --> 00:47:51.223]  They're going to get hundreds of grand for adoption for it.
[00:47:51.983 --> 00:47:53.084]  And they're there.
[00:47:53.124 --> 00:47:54.765]  And once we show up, they've called us.
[00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:56.787]  We open the door, and the Austin cop's choking her.
[00:47:57.606 --> 00:47:58.486]  And we're like, my God!
[00:47:58.587 --> 00:48:00.688]  And we get the camera up and there's footage of a lot of this.
[00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:01.868]  They throw us out.
[00:48:02.588 --> 00:48:03.789]  And then she's crying in there.
[00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:06.450]  They choke her until she signs the document agreeing to the plan.
[00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:07.891]  They snatch the child.
[00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:08.531]  They're laughing.
[00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:10.132]  I mean, the cop walks out.
[00:48:10.152 --> 00:48:10.892]  The woman walks out.
[00:48:10.932 --> 00:48:11.513]  They're laughing.
[00:48:12.253 --> 00:48:13.173]  The woman's crying.
[00:48:13.233 --> 00:48:14.234]  They grab the baby.
[00:48:14.714 --> 00:48:15.754]  Then we got the reports.
[00:48:15.915 --> 00:48:17.135]  It wasn't even her name.
[00:48:17.955 --> 00:48:22.277]  The report they filed with the judge was a woman a year before under a separate name.
[00:48:22.637 --> 00:48:26.338]  And like I heard you on your radio show say, it's not even filled out right.
[00:48:26.378 --> 00:48:28.679]  Hell, they don't even use the same people.
[00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:29.679]  They're so lazy.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:34.561]  It was false evidence that the three-year-old child had been bitten by a dog.
[00:48:34.641 --> 00:48:39.343]  This is a newborn baby and they're saying it's a three-year-old child bitten by a dog, another name, a year ago.
[00:48:39.603 --> 00:48:45.569]  I mean, just hell force, just total criminal, judges laughing, fake names laughing.
[00:48:45.929 --> 00:48:48.772]  I mean, I don't think people realize, Ralph, the magnitude.
[00:48:50.013 --> 00:48:56.078]  Well, they don't, and what I discovered behind this, these judges are bought and paid for by contracts.
[00:48:56.118 --> 00:48:59.942]  They have cooperative agreements, and I've got them out of Florida, I've got them out of Alaska.
[00:48:59.982 --> 00:49:05.227]  They are bound to abide by the regulations, and if they don't do what these agencies want for the money,
[00:49:05.749 --> 00:49:07.009]  Everybody loses money.
[00:49:07.169 --> 00:49:09.730]  The sheriff is hired as an independent contractor.
[00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:10.950]  That's all right in the contract.
[00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:12.111]  He's a hired gun.
[00:49:12.311 --> 00:49:13.411]  And they all get a slice.
[00:49:13.431 --> 00:49:14.611]  We're going back to the main show now.
[00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:17.672]  Let's get into this right now and describe this for people.
[00:49:17.712 --> 00:49:19.473]  Folks, you have not have seen them.
[00:49:19.853 --> 00:49:24.054]  They don't even have in what they file in these fake courts even real names.
[00:49:24.074 --> 00:49:25.034]  They don't even care.
[00:49:25.274 --> 00:49:27.875]  There's not even a pretense of legality.
[00:49:27.915 --> 00:49:28.235]  Here we go.
[00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:33.876]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:49:34.477 --> 00:49:36.739]  Run on for a long time.
[00:49:37.419 --> 00:49:41.702]  Run on for a long time.
[00:49:41.862 --> 00:49:47.287]  I remember about nine years ago, I called into other radio shows crying as I drove home, because it really hit me then.
[00:49:47.307 --> 00:49:49.889]  It's been quite a journey, you know, that's why I have all this anger.
[00:49:51.582 --> 00:50:00.265]  They went down and snatched this woman's baby for no reason and then filed a name from a year before of a three-year-old child, totally separate from her.
[00:50:00.285 --> 00:50:13.590]  And the reason I got Ralph Vaughn is I was listening to his radio show one Sunday here locally in Austin driving, and I heard him talk about in these cases how they file wrong names, they're not even filled out right, the courts aren't real, it's all private contractors.
[00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:17.131]  And I have it on tape, I got copies of it, I showed it on my TV show.
[00:50:17.791 --> 00:50:20.112]  It's on YouTube from eight, nine years ago.
[00:50:20.172 --> 00:50:21.692]  Mike Hanson got it and re-uploaded it.
[00:50:22.292 --> 00:50:25.233]  Where, imagine for me, I didn't know how bad the government was then.
[00:50:25.253 --> 00:50:28.954]  Or these private murder gangs that call themselves government.
[00:50:29.254 --> 00:50:32.075]  I mean, they don't even file... They don't even care.
[00:50:32.095 --> 00:50:34.936]  They just laugh and file the same case with other people's names.
[00:50:35.016 --> 00:50:35.416]  I mean, it's...
[00:50:36.036 --> 00:50:48.424]  Ralph, get into the hearts of these people, because for all the crimes of these private agencies, carrying this out with the private federal reserve, with government seal and signet, the stuff happening to the children is the mother load.
[00:50:48.464 --> 00:50:52.446]  It's over, what, a million for a year the pedophile ring seizes.
[00:50:52.806 --> 00:50:54.787]  But again, it's the bankers carrying out eugenics.
[00:50:55.088 --> 00:50:57.949]  They just hire the pedophile rings to carry out the ops.
[00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:05.214]  Then the family judges, who aren't real judges, have family centers named after them in the local cities as they sit.
[00:51:05.934 --> 00:51:07.035]  It's always the same.
[00:51:07.115 --> 00:51:14.998]  It's always a butch-cut demon woman running it with fat Nelly men as their worker bees.
[00:51:15.358 --> 00:51:17.419]  It even operates like a hive.
[00:51:17.479 --> 00:51:17.939]  Go ahead.
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:27.624]  Well, like I say, when we discovered this, it is government-sponsored sexual abuse pedophilia because they have, the government is 6%,
[00:51:29.231 --> 00:51:35.753]  Florida happens to be one out of every twenty child, legally, can be sexually or physically abused, and they pay you money for this.
[00:51:36.634 --> 00:51:37.394]  That's unbelievable.
[00:51:37.414 --> 00:51:38.774]  This is in all the documents.
[00:51:38.794 --> 00:51:40.655]  Give people the details of these state contracts.
[00:51:41.475 --> 00:51:53.179]  Well, they're called cooperative agreements, and for the states, they have one with the court, and the judge is bound to, he's supposed to abide by the regulations, so that everybody gets their cut of the money.
[00:51:53.826 --> 00:51:55.347]  And the sheriff has a contract.
[00:51:55.648 --> 00:51:56.629]  It's a cooperative agreement.
[00:51:56.709 --> 00:51:58.110]  Usually it's with the county commissioners.
[00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:59.711]  He is an independent contractor.
[00:52:00.392 --> 00:52:12.462]  And to get away from the liability part of this under the 11th Amendment, what the state does, like in Florida and everywhere, they will hire, like the YMCA down there, they hire them as an independent contractor.
[00:52:12.982 --> 00:52:14.083]  And they give them goals.
[00:52:14.143 --> 00:52:17.346]  You must, you must have this many children in the system.
[00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:23.677]  You must adopt out to this many children, and if you don't, you could be penalized up to ten percent.
[00:52:23.737 --> 00:52:28.082]  And to be clear, they then spied for kids to grab within their own systems.
[00:52:28.122 --> 00:52:37.314]  The hospitals, the schools, everything is pedophile ring run, or then they have criminals that just want money, and so they're all spying with a mark on your kids everywhere.
[00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:49.871]  Well, what we found down there in Florida, they actually have it highlighted in the hospital side that's smart to use because every time you take a child to the hospital, young children, it automatically goes over to the child custody.
[00:52:50.535 --> 00:52:54.338]  And they have quotas, so they can just pick and choose what kind of child they want.
[00:52:54.378 --> 00:52:59.121]  They find an excuse, because there is no excuse to have a bruise or any accident.
[00:52:59.282 --> 00:53:01.243]  Every one of them is covered by child custody.
[00:53:01.683 --> 00:53:05.526]  So they just come out and say, well, let's see, we need, like Greg's, we need four kids.
[00:53:05.606 --> 00:53:06.367]  Oh, they're good kids.
[00:53:06.407 --> 00:53:07.428]  This is good stuff here.
[00:53:07.528 --> 00:53:12.491]  We can sell them out, which they've already adopted them out, and we've got a minimum of $16,000.
[00:53:13.072 --> 00:53:15.954]  Actually, in Florida, then, they've also set it up so that if the
[00:53:16.702 --> 00:53:27.172]  Uh, Florida state employees get them, they get five or ten thousand dollars per head just to adopt a bout, and then of course the state gets around and pays for help with the education and the medical.
[00:53:27.673 --> 00:53:30.656]  So we take these kids that are in the Christian movement
[00:53:31.511 --> 00:53:35.234]  Oh yeah, and homeschooling, and we're going to re-establish them over on our side.
[00:54:02.612 --> 00:54:09.798]  Well, there is a root to this particular problem, the root of the tree that produces the poisonous fruit.
[00:54:09.958 --> 00:54:10.539]  It started in 1866.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.042]  And they created a citizen of the United States.
[00:54:15.182 --> 00:54:16.844]  Out of thin air, they just made it up.
[00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:21.588]  It was strictly for the Negroes, the extreme court has said so, and what they said.
[00:54:21.608 --> 00:54:27.292]  Now, this is pretty astounding, and you can check it out on the internet, because all my stuff I do is, I document.
[00:54:27.412 --> 00:54:29.094]  Now, give out your website, give out your email.
[00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.991]  I don't know.
[00:54:43.748 --> 00:54:47.789]  I have a special list, too, where I put out documents so that you don't have to go look for it.
[00:54:47.889 --> 00:54:51.231]  Tell folks what Just Belli means, or Just Belli.
[00:54:51.671 --> 00:54:54.211]  It means Law of War, because they're waging war on the people.
[00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:55.312]  That's right, and they state that.
[00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:56.072]  Letter of Mark.
[00:54:56.332 --> 00:54:59.853]  We are enemy rebels and savages to be exterminated.
[00:55:00.834 --> 00:55:01.194]  Go ahead.
[00:55:01.234 --> 00:55:02.014]  That's what they're doing.
[00:55:02.594 --> 00:55:03.895]  Stated, Letter of Mark.
[00:55:03.935 --> 00:55:04.275]  Go ahead.
[00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:09.516]  And the root of the tree that produces this poisonous fruit.
[00:55:09.936 --> 00:55:11.697]  All we've got to do, everybody's got to look in the mirror.
[00:55:12.321 --> 00:55:16.945]  Because most people still don't know that the Federal Reserve has got nothing to do with our government.
[00:55:17.666 --> 00:55:18.326]  Well, guess what?
[00:55:18.807 --> 00:55:22.430]  A citizen of the United States has nothing to do with our government either.
[00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:23.571]  That was created in 1866.
[00:55:24.192 --> 00:55:28.636]  It was memorialized in the 14th Amendment in 1868.
[00:55:29.697 --> 00:55:35.261]  And then in 1870, they quietly made it so that the blacks were exactly equal to the whites.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:36.820]  We are.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.081]  Everybody thinks they're a citizen of the United States.
[00:55:39.161 --> 00:55:41.662]  Well, what they said... Blacks were not raised up.
[00:55:42.122 --> 00:55:43.303]  Everyone was brought down.
[00:55:44.823 --> 00:55:45.684]  Well, we work.
[00:55:45.924 --> 00:55:46.944]  It's a fictional law.
[00:55:47.064 --> 00:55:52.206]  If they said everybody's going to be Santa Claus and we're going to have Rudolph in every garage, we'd say, no, no, no, that's not so.
[00:55:53.066 --> 00:55:55.407]  But everybody thinks they're a citizen of the United States.
[00:55:55.507 --> 00:55:59.609]  And what it's found today in Title 42, 1981, 82, and 88.
[00:56:00.089 --> 00:56:01.589]  And here's what it says.
[00:56:01.669 --> 00:56:02.550]  This is astounding.
[00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.651]  Congress is going to grant you the benefit.
[00:56:06.677 --> 00:56:14.000]  To sue and be sued on private and personal property, the right to contract, and to have the same rights as enjoyed by white citizens.
[00:56:15.561 --> 00:56:17.222]  Does that sound just a little racist?
[00:56:17.322 --> 00:56:19.383]  And that is what a citizen of the United States is.
[00:56:19.583 --> 00:56:21.063]  It's still there today in the Code.
[00:56:22.844 --> 00:56:23.704]  Unbelievable, isn't it?
[00:56:23.764 --> 00:56:27.186]  And the Supreme Court said, if you take this status, this benefit,
[00:56:28.214 --> 00:56:31.936]  You then have no right to any court of law and you have no right to a remedy.
[00:56:31.976 --> 00:56:32.637]  That's Babcock.
[00:56:32.897 --> 00:56:33.217]  That's right.
[00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:36.359]  It makes you a ward of the state or chattel.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.021]  Well, it's like you have a child.
[00:56:39.041 --> 00:56:39.821]  You have a child at home.
[00:56:39.841 --> 00:56:42.603]  You say, okay, I'm going to get around and give you a dollar, do the dishes.
[00:56:42.663 --> 00:56:43.904]  No, you pissed me off.
[00:56:43.964 --> 00:56:45.305]  I'm not going to give you any money at all.
[00:56:45.865 --> 00:56:47.146]  There's no remedy for the child.
[00:56:47.586 --> 00:56:48.547]  And that's what we've done.
[00:56:48.627 --> 00:56:49.547]  We have surrendered.
[00:56:50.128 --> 00:56:52.389]  We have sold our birthright for a bowl of porridge.
[00:56:53.149 --> 00:56:53.910]  We've been hoodwinked.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.561]  And that's our problem today.
[00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:05.524]  And the foolish cops and workers that carry all this out are having their water and food and everything poisoned publicly.
[00:57:06.685 --> 00:57:07.786]  They love dying of cancer.
[00:57:07.806 --> 00:57:08.766]  They love being slaves.
[00:57:09.647 --> 00:57:11.688]  But the average cop is just completely ignorant.
[00:57:11.848 --> 00:57:13.809]  They just have no idea what they're a part of.
[00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:18.811]  And not even all social workers are in the wicked guild.
[00:57:19.071 --> 00:57:21.712]  But now they're snatching old people and taking their money.
[00:57:22.133 --> 00:57:24.554]  I mean, now it's just, my God, we're in hell.
[00:57:25.543 --> 00:57:36.285]  The thing is, you give people with no accountability what they perceive as power, and we got Hitlers like Hitler never had Hitlers in Germany.
[00:57:36.565 --> 00:57:38.625]  God, there was only one of that sucker in Germany.
[00:57:38.985 --> 00:57:42.626]  We got them all over, Roger, because these people, there's no accountability.
[00:57:42.646 --> 00:57:43.546]  They just do whatever they want.
[00:57:44.486 --> 00:57:49.347]  And they're called agents, and that's why that movie Matrix, because they can just appear anywhere.
[00:57:50.608 --> 00:57:52.548]  And when I finally figured this out,
[00:57:53.075 --> 00:57:54.036]  We have no government.
[00:57:54.276 --> 00:57:55.076]  It's gone, folks.
[00:57:55.837 --> 00:57:57.698]  Because everybody uses the word agency.
[00:57:58.098 --> 00:58:02.622]  Well, I got news for all the crooks and agencies in uniform who think it's all funny.
[00:58:03.122 --> 00:58:04.923]  Your masters are going to hurt you bad.
[00:58:05.403 --> 00:58:06.644]  You think you're part of the system?
[00:58:06.664 --> 00:58:07.405]  You're going to find out.
[00:58:07.445 --> 00:58:08.045]  Keep laughing!
[00:58:08.345 --> 00:58:08.906]  Keep laughing!
[00:58:09.847 --> 00:58:11.527]  I mean, Ralph, here's the problem.
[00:58:11.567 --> 00:58:18.129]  At the top of the pyramid, I'm sure you know about all the thousands of admitted chemical, biological, radiological tests on the troops and police and others.
[00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:28.112]  They kill our troops all the time for 60 years in tests to create other cadres of military that will do the killing just as a test.
[00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:34.416]  And it's an admitted declassified fact, and the public can't figure out, that of course they carried out 9-11.
[00:58:34.496 --> 00:58:39.439]  I mean, if our government were to radiate four and a half thousand children, U.S.
[00:58:39.499 --> 00:58:45.683]  children, frying them to death, just to test radiation systems, oh, but they wouldn't kill you on 9-11.
[00:58:45.743 --> 00:58:50.206]  I mean, it's a wonderland for psychos, isn't it?
[00:58:51.206 --> 00:58:56.910]  Well, it is, and you know, it's just like, I look for black and white issues.
[00:58:57.762 --> 00:58:58.702]  What I call a bright light.
[00:58:59.002 --> 00:58:59.723]  Oklahoma City.
[00:59:00.023 --> 00:59:01.603]  They had all kinds of video cameras.
[00:59:01.623 --> 00:59:03.184]  You know what's missing in Oklahoma City?
[00:59:03.364 --> 00:59:05.145]  There's no hole in the ground out in front.
[00:59:05.225 --> 00:59:07.485]  So therefore, there was no fertilizer bomb.
[00:59:07.545 --> 00:59:09.106]  It's all a freaking lie.
[00:59:09.186 --> 00:59:12.627]  And they won't release the videos and the FBI that's seen it say that it was moldable?
[00:59:12.707 --> 00:59:17.909]  No, but these are the TV camera videos of all the different, out of the helicopters they were flying around.
[00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:18.669]  No, no, no.
[00:59:18.809 --> 00:59:19.269]  I know those.
[00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.310]  I agree there's no hole.
[00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:20.750]  I agree.
[00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:23.631]  I'm saying, but then the close-up videos they seized him.
[00:59:24.844 --> 00:59:30.348]  Yeah, you go to 9-11, the Pentagon, there's no plane, there's no motors, and there's no people!
[00:59:31.529 --> 00:59:40.435]  And the towers, there's never been a steel building come down yet, and two of them came down in the same day within hours, and then the other building, 7, you can see it go down, and...
[00:59:43.418 --> 00:59:44.740]  Here's an example.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.083]  The Gardasil vaccine admittedly kills people.
[00:59:48.123 --> 00:59:49.944]  They admit it in their own insert.
[00:59:50.285 --> 00:59:54.308]  It says, this gives you cancer, this kills you, and they run out and inject themselves.
[00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:55.129]  Have you heard the latest?
[00:59:55.149 --> 00:59:59.713]  They're going to put three to eight year olds on statin cholesterol drugs?
[01:00:00.594 --> 01:00:01.035]  Oh God.
[01:00:01.155 --> 01:00:04.037]  I mean, it's just, it's hell force, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:04.398 --> 01:00:05.158]  You understand?
[01:00:06.138 --> 01:00:09.279]  There's two interesting things that I was watching.
[01:00:10.059 --> 01:00:17.221]  One is I watched what happened in Texas when they kidnapped, and that's what they're doing, they're kidnapping children for money, for slavery.
[01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.822]  They kidnap them, hold them for ransom, and they sell them off.
[01:00:20.542 --> 01:00:26.104]  The interesting part is what happened in Texas when they took all those children, they filed a mandamus.
[01:00:27.104 --> 01:00:30.545]  And a mandamus is to obey your rules and regulations.
[01:00:31.266 --> 01:00:35.507]  Now this is what I've come up with, and this week we are finally attacking the IRS.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.120]  I don't think so.
[01:00:52.406 --> 01:01:01.275]  The only thing the courts are bound by, the only thing the agencies are bound by, the only thing that the agents are bound by is what's published in the Federal Register.
[01:01:01.395 --> 01:01:03.116]  And I know there is some success with that.
[01:01:03.136 --> 01:01:09.102]  The problem is that they will only accept that from higher directives of someone higher up the totem pole.
[01:01:09.603 --> 01:01:16.069]  And these Mormons had a boatload of money, and the government's so hated now, it was a PR backfire.
[01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:23.395]  My whole issue is that they selectively enforce even their own codes and regulations, as you know.
[01:01:24.455 --> 01:01:27.017]  Well, they do, but I've been jerking the judge around here.
[01:01:27.057 --> 01:01:31.961]  I provide research and material that will fight this, and we've been starting now to jerk these judges around.
[01:01:32.862 --> 01:01:36.284]  I've got two summary judgments, and I've killed commercial stuff here in the last three weeks.
[01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:45.391]  But we're going to see how this plays out, because this is the only thing that binds these people, because they don't work for us.
[01:01:46.314 --> 01:01:56.260]  Now, getting back to the Hell Force, let's just go over the makeup of the Family Destruction Services, their own books they take in college.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:58.481]  They say the family's a disease to be eradicated.
[01:01:58.521 --> 01:01:59.762]  We provided all those to you.
[01:02:00.122 --> 01:02:03.744]  So their job, eradicate the family, break down homeschoolers.
[01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:06.346]  They viciously hate Christians.
[01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:12.730]  Let's go over that, how that particular mercenary force
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.551]  Operates and how illegitimate they are.
[01:02:18.552 --> 01:02:27.796]  Well, like I say, it is because Congress has set this up and they can target any group that they want to tear apart.
[01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.577]  Number one, they must tear apart the families.
[01:02:31.237 --> 01:02:34.559]  So they have set up the adoption part that we have.
[01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.660]  It's something short of bounty hunting.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.721]  They offer money for every child.
[01:02:40.399 --> 01:02:42.840]  If you get over this amount, you start making money.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.401]  And that means that these child custody folks, then they can hire more of them.
[01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:47.782]  That means your job is secure.
[01:02:48.782 --> 01:02:51.483]  So, I mean, these people, they're going to do it.
[01:02:51.803 --> 01:02:52.424]  And that's what we do.
[01:02:52.444 --> 01:02:52.924]  And that's right.
[01:02:52.964 --> 01:02:56.305]  It's growing like a flesh-eating bacteria infection.
[01:02:56.665 --> 01:02:57.926]  It's exponentially growing.
[01:02:57.966 --> 01:03:00.067]  It's like mold eating a whole loaf of bread.
[01:03:00.407 --> 01:03:01.167]  It's like cancer.
[01:03:01.187 --> 01:03:03.408]  They're just going wild in our blood.
[01:03:04.568 --> 01:03:06.009]  Well, it's like, okay.
[01:03:07.093 --> 01:03:10.856]  The Act of Congress says we take the average of a three-year, the last three years baseline.
[01:03:11.317 --> 01:03:19.943]  Now we take the next three years, well the next year is higher, so that means we have to kidnap more kids to keep our jobs, and so then we do that.
[01:03:21.284 --> 01:03:26.889]  Every year it's an automatic setup means that we are going to destroy the family.
[01:03:26.909 --> 01:03:29.331]  That's right, Clinton accelerated that one in 1997.
[01:03:29.391 --> 01:03:29.991]  Explain that.
[01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:33.574]  They have to up the bounty just to get the original money.
[01:03:34.659 --> 01:03:35.220]  Well, right.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:40.605]  And every year the numbers keep going up, the number of children in the system.
[01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:44.909]  Well, of course, if your job depends on kidnapping a child, what are you going to do?
[01:03:44.949 --> 01:03:46.051]  You're going to go kidnap them.
[01:03:46.091 --> 01:03:47.112]  And where do they find them?
[01:03:47.612 --> 01:03:50.295]  They have the schools and they have the hospitals.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:56.102]  Where they send them the information of any child that has a bruise or anything.
[01:03:56.343 --> 01:03:56.943]  It's worse than that.
[01:03:57.023 --> 01:03:58.504]  Let me give you an example.
[01:03:59.024 --> 01:04:00.364]  You're at the hospital having a baby.
[01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:01.085]  This just happened to me.
[01:04:01.125 --> 01:04:02.525]  And I go there because I know the doctor.
[01:04:02.585 --> 01:04:03.206]  She's a fan.
[01:04:03.246 --> 01:04:03.886]  She's not bad.
[01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:04.646]  But the system is.
[01:04:05.167 --> 01:04:06.987]  And I've already had three children, so I know how it is.
[01:04:07.047 --> 01:04:07.528]  And I'm in there.
[01:04:08.368 --> 01:04:10.370]  And she says, Oh, hon, will you run this down?
[01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:12.572]  The master nurse getting my wife ready to go in.
[01:04:13.052 --> 01:04:15.234]  Will you run this file down to the floor next to me?
[01:04:15.294 --> 01:04:15.715]  Thank you.
[01:04:15.755 --> 01:04:16.415]  And then I leave.
[01:04:16.736 --> 01:04:19.678]  I wink at my wife and the lady says, How is your home?
[01:04:19.698 --> 01:04:21.440]  I got plenty of money, plenty of food.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.682]  That's enough to take care of the kids right there.
[01:04:23.722 --> 01:04:24.643]  Is your husband nice to you?
[01:04:24.683 --> 01:04:25.343]  Got a good relationship?
[01:04:25.383 --> 01:04:26.524]  You can tell me, honey.
[01:04:26.865 --> 01:04:29.127]  And she's right there at a computer hooked into the police.
[01:04:29.847 --> 01:04:31.629]  Not telling you, not reading your rights, nothing.
[01:04:31.649 --> 01:04:32.790]  My wife says, no, we're fine.
[01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:33.430]  We're great.
[01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:33.991]  We're doing good.
[01:04:34.691 --> 01:04:37.174]  And then I come back and the woman's slyly on her power trip.
[01:04:37.234 --> 01:04:38.995]  Thank you for doing that.
[01:04:39.395 --> 01:04:42.678]  She's a bucket of pus because she has to do this for her job.
[01:04:42.758 --> 01:04:44.040]  She does it to love it.
[01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.662]  She's on her own power trip, but something's happening.
[01:04:46.702 --> 01:04:48.363]  Now they're going to grab her grandchildren's kids.
[01:04:48.403 --> 01:04:49.745]  Now they're not wanting to do it.
[01:04:49.765 --> 01:04:52.387]  I talked to other nurses about how horrible it is.
[01:04:52.447 --> 01:04:53.608]  They all know what's going on.
[01:04:53.648 --> 01:04:54.449]  Some of them are fans.
[01:04:54.949 --> 01:04:57.270]  But the point is, this is it.
[01:04:58.171 --> 01:04:59.972]  You are being reported on everywhere.
[01:05:00.012 --> 01:05:00.572]  Go ahead, Ralph.
[01:05:01.593 --> 01:05:09.477]  Well, like a lady that I've been helping here, she was in there and they took her child for no reason and they adopted it out.
[01:05:09.497 --> 01:05:11.218]  She had another child down in Montana.
[01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:15.480]  And they came in there and their big issue... Well, you've already had one child taken out.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.200]  There's no facts.
[01:05:16.701 --> 01:05:19.242]  But we don't think you know how to change diapers either.
[01:05:19.402 --> 01:05:22.244]  But the big issue is, she happens to be a very large woman, around 300
[01:05:23.648 --> 01:05:27.862]  So therefore you might damage your child so therefore we're going to take your child just because of your weight.
[01:05:28.683 --> 01:05:31.865]  And that's what the cashless grid, the cashless tracking system is about.
[01:05:59.804 --> 01:06:07.190]  Well, one of the things we have to look at here is like in Alaska, we had two people got in a pissing match over a tabby.
[01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:09.111]  It was a cat in a business.
[01:06:09.312 --> 01:06:12.054]  And so they actually had a trial by jury of who's going to get the cat.
[01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:15.897]  Now they get around and they take children with no trial by jury.
[01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:17.798]  And no facts.
[01:06:18.839 --> 01:06:22.702]  They just make it up, and then they close the initial hearing off.
[01:06:22.843 --> 01:06:25.625]  It does not have any... How did the cat come into this one?
[01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:29.959]  Well, what I was saying is, you can have a cat, and they will have a trial by jury.
[01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:34.561]  Before you give the ownership of the cat away, you take children, and there's no trial by jury.
[01:06:35.541 --> 01:06:36.622]  That's right, there's no nothing.
[01:06:36.662 --> 01:06:43.465]  And explain, these family courts are literally part of the, uh, just outside the... Well, here's an example.
[01:06:43.525 --> 01:06:44.085]  Here in Austin,
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:48.721]  Judge Jean Meir and her designates set up portable buildings at every school.
[01:06:49.221 --> 01:06:52.942]  Now, if a child's late to class three times, that doesn't violate state truancy law.
[01:06:53.342 --> 01:07:00.844]  They falsely charge you with that, but then have the father sign a form saying your child's on probation for doing something that isn't against the law.
[01:07:02.004 --> 01:07:03.325]  And then, now you're in the system.
[01:07:04.085 --> 01:07:04.905]  See what I'm saying, Ralph?
[01:07:06.152 --> 01:07:07.533]  It's a total overthrow.
[01:07:07.553 --> 01:07:17.677]  There's no evidence, there's no anything, and because the people do not understand, don't know how to fight this thing, and they have a belief system that the cop has police power, that these people... Stay there, stay there.
[01:07:17.697 --> 01:07:18.877]  We're going to keep talking during the break.
[01:07:20.238 --> 01:07:20.478]  Are you?
[01:07:20.918 --> 01:07:22.118]  Ralph, this is too incredible.
[01:07:22.138 --> 01:07:32.302]  I'm going to have to have you up in the next few weeks for two hours, because you just... I want to go over all of it, and then go over procedures of what you do to fight back against them, but get into the family court structure real fast.
[01:07:33.443 --> 01:07:34.163]  Well, uh...
[01:07:35.347 --> 01:07:38.009]  I've actually been thrown out of it because it got so bad up here.
[01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:45.214]  They had one up here where a family had a boy chained up outside and he had infection with maggots in it.
[01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:50.878]  And a gal had been raped, actually two of them, and so it finally blew the hell out of them.
[01:07:50.898 --> 01:07:53.060]  These are people taken by the child rape forces.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.721]  Oh yeah, they were taken.
[01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:55.382]  Let's explain.
[01:07:55.422 --> 01:07:58.324]  They're allowed to torture, murder, anything.
[01:07:58.344 --> 01:08:00.025]  Okay, so he's outside chained up.
[01:08:00.365 --> 01:08:02.226]  The hell force has got him with maggots.
[01:08:02.267 --> 01:08:02.647]  Go ahead.
[01:08:03.677 --> 01:08:07.359]  Well, then what they do is, see, they close all these courts down so the public can't see.
[01:08:07.419 --> 01:08:11.101]  They're all private because we want to protect the privacy for the children.
[01:08:11.822 --> 01:08:17.245]  So they finally started to open up these hearings so that people could go in there and see what's going on.
[01:08:17.305 --> 01:08:18.466]  I got through out of two of them.
[01:08:18.946 --> 01:08:22.228]  But in this particular instance, these people were so egregious.
[01:08:22.869 --> 01:08:27.571]  These two young gals tried to commit suicide, and the grandmother wanted them, and they wouldn't give them.
[01:08:28.092 --> 01:08:33.415]  But anyway, to get the charges against these people, the child custody wouldn't give the evidence to the DA.
[01:08:33.996 --> 01:08:36.537]  So, they got the charges dropped down to almost nothing.
[01:08:36.937 --> 01:08:40.939]  I mean, they spent a little time... Describe what was happening, chained outside with the maggots.
[01:08:41.699 --> 01:08:45.401]  Well, this child, because he was disobeying, they chained him outside.
[01:08:46.081 --> 01:08:49.642]  And he had a wound, and it actually had maggots in it.
[01:08:50.103 --> 01:08:58.506]  We had another one here in Alaska, where the foster care wanted the foster care kids to kill another kid.
[01:08:59.079 --> 01:08:59.839]  And they wouldn't do it.
[01:08:59.959 --> 01:09:05.120]  And the actual foster care parents killed this child in front.
[01:09:06.561 --> 01:09:09.501]  And I see the cases all the time where they commit murder and don't get in trouble.
[01:09:09.962 --> 01:09:16.923]  My God, they have giant rape orgies in the jails.
[01:09:16.963 --> 01:09:17.723]  I just can't believe it.
[01:09:17.743 --> 01:09:18.303]  These bastards.
[01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:23.025]  I can't wait to take this country back and just have mass trials of all these bastards around.
[01:09:23.065 --> 01:09:24.825]  Wouldn't you love to see them all swinging from ropes?
[01:09:25.785 --> 01:09:26.566]  Well, absolutely.
[01:09:26.606 --> 01:09:34.052]  I want to get him up there and we'll give him a trial by jury, you betcha, and then just call Ralph and I'll be the executioner and I'll sleep very well at night.
[01:09:34.652 --> 01:09:35.273]  Absolutely.
[01:09:35.333 --> 01:09:46.061]  I mean, God, when I read about how a girl in school will, you know, they'll ask them, a ten-year-old, you know, your mom's a Christian, she doesn't let you do this, and they say, would you like to be a lesbian?
[01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:46.742]  She says yes.
[01:09:47.142 --> 01:10:01.019]  So they hand her to two lesbian CPS workers, this is a famous case in Oregon, and then the mother is given her back in a court case, and on the steps they pull up, beat the woman up, take the child, and then was found years later dead.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.442]  But I mean, they just murder force whoever they want.
[01:10:04.804 --> 01:10:05.665]  Ralph, we're out of time.
[01:10:05.685 --> 01:10:09.589]  I'm going to come back and say bye to you and tell folks to check out your website.
[01:10:09.629 --> 01:10:10.891]  I want to have you up very soon.
[01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:11.952]  I know you're a good man.
[01:10:11.992 --> 01:10:13.313]  I know the info is accurate.
[01:10:14.294 --> 01:10:15.676]  Next time I won't run over you as much.
[01:10:15.736 --> 01:10:18.739]  It just really upsets me because I've seen so much of what you're talking about.
[01:10:18.759 --> 01:10:19.080]  Here we go.
[01:10:26.158 --> 01:10:27.799]  Yeah, Ralph Deere in the behind-the-scenes segment.
[01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:33.200]  I'm gonna have him back up soon to really spend time, maybe get him up with some of the people that have gone through this, Mr. Pound and others.
[01:10:34.241 --> 01:10:42.763]  You understand, he goes and fights with the kids CPS has got, where they chain them up and maggots are eating them outside, and they're raping them, killing them, and CPS defends it.
[01:10:43.144 --> 01:10:43.904]  This is a
[01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:47.186]  Group of people that like to rape and torture kids.
[01:10:47.266 --> 01:10:49.327]  The eugenicists, that's how CPS started.
[01:10:50.488 --> 01:10:54.290]  They set it up because they want to break the family up, but imagine the scum that would do this.
[01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:56.151]  Well, that's who gravitates to do it.
[01:10:57.132 --> 01:10:58.513]  And my God.
[01:11:00.342 --> 01:11:15.286]  Being a carpet cleaner for a summer, I saw a lot of these smaller foster home houses where the kids are on dirty mattresses, you got these dope-head drug addict pedophile parents waddling around in the house, and I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:11:15.426 --> 01:11:16.247]  I just can't handle it.
[01:11:16.267 --> 01:11:20.628]  These bastards rule, they suck our blood, and they're going to go to hell!
[01:11:21.248 --> 01:11:23.349]  I know you're evil, you murdering bastards!
[01:11:24.089 --> 01:11:27.490]  Ralph Winterud, give out your website, spell it out, and we're going to have you up again soon.
[01:11:28.297 --> 01:11:40.402]  Yeah, it's Jess Belli, it's a Latin word, J as in Jack, J-U-S, and then like a bell, bravo, it's J-U-S-B-E-L-L-I dot com, and my email is ralph at jessbelli dot com.
[01:11:43.806 --> 01:11:44.246]  We're good to go.
[01:11:59.631 --> 01:12:01.392]  Okay, thanks for having me, and we'll talk to you later.
[01:12:01.512 --> 01:12:02.053]  Absolutely.
[01:12:02.093 --> 01:12:06.976]  Folks, do not be in Florida, Michigan, California, New York State.
[01:12:07.777 --> 01:12:13.200]  I mean, they supply kids to drug testing, you know, and pesticide testing in those states.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.121]  Texas is bad.
[01:12:15.482 --> 01:12:17.883]  And God help us, I wish what I was saying wasn't true.
[01:12:17.923 --> 01:12:18.664]  We're out of time.
[01:12:18.684 --> 01:12:24.228]  I want you to stay with us, though, because without these sponsors, we wouldn't exist.
[01:12:25.956 --> 01:12:28.498]  One of them is interfood, and interfood is really great stuff.
[01:12:28.538 --> 01:12:29.779]  It's the best green food out there.
[01:12:29.819 --> 01:12:31.280]  I saw my wife taking it this morning.
[01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:46.533]  Two little scoops, 20 superfoods, spirulina, chlorella, wheatgrass, barley grass, kelp, dulse, 14 other things unpasteurized so you get full absorption in your intestines and your stomach of the trace minerals and the vitamins.
[01:12:46.553 --> 01:12:48.695]  They got the green food, the healthy coffees, the
[01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.087]  They got so much more.
[01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:53.030]  I don't plug something unless I believe in it.
[01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:54.611]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:12:55.152 --> 01:12:57.535]  Link through on the banner to get 10% off.
[01:12:58.135 --> 01:13:01.019]  Because by clicking through, it gives you the automatic discount from InfoWars.
[01:13:01.399 --> 01:13:02.220]  That's how that works.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.582]  They have a little cookie that does that.
[01:13:03.622 --> 01:13:06.485]  So you get 10% off when you go to that subpage.
[01:13:06.545 --> 01:13:07.266]  Or is it a subpage?
[01:13:07.306 --> 01:13:08.067]  I'm not sure how it works.
[01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:10.989]  Is that a cookie or just a sub-page where you get the discount?
[01:13:27.797 --> 01:13:36.104]  Also, the great folks at eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect.com, and they are the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:13:36.485 --> 01:13:44.231]  With all these uncertain times, the main way the criminal's running things will control you if they want is to have a depression and shut the food off and make you come to their centers.
[01:13:45.352 --> 01:13:45.633]  I think?
[01:14:15.132 --> 01:14:18.213]  I love all of you.
[01:14:18.233 --> 01:14:22.555]  I want to rally you against the tyranny that is upon us, that is attacking us everywhere.
[01:14:22.595 --> 01:14:27.356]  Only a blind, deaf, dumb, and blind person would not be aware of what's going on.
[01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.217]  None are so blind as those that have eyes and will not see.
[01:14:30.978 --> 01:14:34.219]  I'm telling you, I've seen stuff that is just off the charts insane.
[01:14:34.639 --> 01:14:35.659]  It's only getting worse.
[01:14:35.719 --> 01:14:37.360]  It's getting crazier than I even thought.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.640]  They're poisoning you.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.621]  They're attacking you.
[01:14:39.861 --> 01:14:41.421]  They're your dumb servants out there.
[01:14:41.461 --> 01:14:42.802]  They're attacking you, you idiots.
[01:14:43.662 --> 01:14:45.645]  Just repent of your evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:45.685 --> 01:14:49.450]  Retransmission with incredible guests after incredible guests on banking.
