[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.789]  Thank you for listening to GCA.
[00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:38.318]  We're good to go.
[00:01:54.975 --> 00:01:56.436]  And I won't back down!
[00:01:56.536 --> 00:02:23.016]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this October 6th, 2008, worldwide broadcast on the AM and FM dial, simulcasting on multiple satellites, the Internet at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, global shortwave and the podcast right at 100,000 people a day, downloading that six days a week.
[00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:24.137]  We're here Monday through Friday,
[00:02:25.318 --> 00:02:26.338]  11 to 3 p.m.
[00:02:26.378 --> 00:02:30.641]  Central Standard Time, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas.
[00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:34.804]  And then, of course, Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:38.787]  With an abbreviated radio show.
[00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:53.718]  Okay, he was on with us about three weeks ago, and it was only for an hour, and so I wanted to get him up for two hours to talk about the nature of reality, the International Banking Syndicate, the Crime Syndicate, engineering the collapse that he and others detailed
[00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:56.564]  To a great extent.
[00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:00.067]  David Icke will be with us in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:03:00.107 --> 00:03:05.411]  He'll be with us coming up at one o'clock Central Standard Time.
[00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:06.953]  He is in California.
[00:03:07.673 --> 00:03:13.358]  Just finished two big events, or actually three big events that he had out there.
[00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:22.967]  So he will be with us coming up in the third and fourth hour today on this October 6th.
[00:03:24.386 --> 00:03:24.786]  2008 edition.
[00:03:24.866 --> 00:03:35.568]  I don't have to tell you that the markets are in absolute free fall going down to 10,000 points today.
[00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:46.971]  If you listen to the radio shows we did last Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday, we stated that of course the markets are going to plunge.
[00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:49.271]  That's the whole point.
[00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:50.571]  They needed to get the immunity
[00:03:53.632 --> 00:04:03.758]  For the crimes of the international banks, the brokerage houses that carried out the Ponzi scheme with the fake liquidity that they're going to leave us holding the bag with.
[00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:11.022]  In the provision, it makes the Federal Reserve dictatorial through the Secretary of the Treasury, the private Federal Reserve.
[00:04:11.902 --> 00:04:15.904]  It allows them to seize any homes they want, revalue mortgages up or down.
[00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:20.687]  It allows them carbon taxes of all different types.
[00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:22.268]  It allows them to hand
[00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:28.692]  Your tax money over to foreign corporations and none of it can be second-guessed or even reviewed.
[00:04:28.712 --> 00:04:31.333]  It states that clearly.
[00:04:31.413 --> 00:04:39.095]  It says at the discretion of the Treasury Secretary, he can create a flim-flam group chaired by himself to push recommendations and propaganda.
[00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:44.136]  And so global markets are headed straight down right now.
[00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:46.857]  The stock market plunging and just unprecedented.
[00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:50.978]  Last week when the public
[00:04:55.202 --> 00:05:11.632]  One, not to go along with it, the establishment reacted by savagely, savagely attacking the market and driving it down 1.2 trillion.
[00:05:11.652 --> 00:05:14.734]  Well, they've just outdone that today.
[00:05:15.374 --> 00:05:16.295]  The market is down 400, 400, 443.55, 443.55.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.245]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:36.886]  And we knew what to do.
[00:05:36.906 --> 00:05:38.668]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:05:38.888 --> 00:05:45.253]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:54.473]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:05:54.814 --> 00:06:01.636]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:04.956]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:04.976 --> 00:06:10.078]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:06:10.858 --> 00:06:13.820]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:19.785]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[00:06:22.907 --> 00:06:27.831]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:06:29.418 --> 00:06:32.703]  The United States is bankrupt and the bankers want you bankrupt also.

[00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:25.505]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:45.376]  The next hour and 52 minutes, we're joined by David Icke, who is in the United States and California.
[00:08:45.797 --> 00:08:49.640]  He had several events with more than 2,000 people showing up to just one of them.
[00:08:50.701 --> 00:08:53.664]  And we have the same type thing happen.
[00:08:53.684 --> 00:08:56.967]  We have an event, 1,200, 2,000 show up.
[00:08:57.147 --> 00:08:58.388]  It is just incredible.
[00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:01.571]  And this is only being done through the alternative media.
[00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:04.054]  So while we see the stock market plunging
[00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:10.570]  uh... six hundred plus points today after the bankers got their empowerment immunity takeover bill
[00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:28.582]  Understand, at least the good news is thousands to one, according to members of Congress, phone calls against it last week, even after the White House said, depression, depression, and then didn't have the Plunge Protection Team prop up the market last Monday when it went down over a trillion dollars.
[00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:32.884]  Well, the same thing's happened today, after the bankers got their power, because this is part of a consolidation.
[00:09:33.184 --> 00:09:35.346]  And David Eisenhower talked about that, he's been writing about that for
[00:09:35.786 --> 00:09:42.713]  Plus 20 years, how the main power of the New World Order in the physical realm is their banking fraud, their fractional reserve system.
[00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:49.659]  But I want to first talk, the man who needs no introduction, about the incredibly positive thing.
[00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:55.865]  Because as the enemy moves against us, as they try to destroy the middle class and slave the people so they've got to go to the government for their food,
[00:09:57.106 --> 00:10:07.010]  So that there can be a financial collapse, riots in the streets, so they can use the military on us as they're now announcing in mainstream news to be the saviors, so we accept a militarized banana boat economy.
[00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:16.114]  The positive news that, this isn't hype when I say it, there is an awakening so huge it dwarfs anything a month ago, or anything a year ago.
[00:10:16.134 --> 00:10:17.095]  It is exponential.
[00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:17.695]  Here's an example.
[00:10:18.215 --> 00:10:19.817]  We call up Chuck Norris to come on the show.
[00:10:19.857 --> 00:10:20.338]  Never tried.
[00:10:20.718 --> 00:10:21.859]  He goes, oh, I'm a huge fan.
[00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:22.660]  I listen all the time.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.381]  I want to come on.
[00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:30.749]  He comes on, endorses Ron Paul, moves away from the neocons, and says on air he agrees with everything I'm talking about.
[00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.652]  I mean, again, Bruce Willis.
[00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:37.476]  goes public and says I'm no longer a neocon, I know there's a new world order, a false reality.
[00:10:37.716 --> 00:10:39.758]  They're losing all their main icons.
[00:10:39.858 --> 00:10:48.466]  On the left, the left is waking up and breaking the paradigm and breaking the controlled tiny box reality and seeing the wider universe around them.
[00:10:48.886 --> 00:10:53.510]  So there is a consciousness shift in information analysis and it is the hundredth monkey.
[00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.651]  There is a group consciousness.
[00:10:55.032 --> 00:10:55.292]  It is
[00:10:55.752 --> 00:10:56.673]  It is spreading.
[00:10:56.693 --> 00:10:57.534]  It is happening.
[00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:58.755]  It is a mass awareness.
[00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:00.517]  And it is beautiful.
[00:11:00.997 --> 00:11:02.999]  And so out of this adversity, it's going to get bad.
[00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:03.800]  We're going to be tested.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.984]  Realize that this is evil trying to maintain control.
[00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:15.812]  David Icke, after a very successful tour, which thousands and thousands came out to see in California, we welcome you to the airwaves.
[00:11:16.212 --> 00:11:16.693]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:11:17.768 --> 00:11:18.628]  Sir, you've got the floor.
[00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:26.532]  Let's break down the shift, what's happening, the positive, and then get into your analysis on the banking global takeover, then we'll get into the nature of reality itself.
[00:11:27.352 --> 00:11:41.378]  Well, the thing is, Alex, that I've been a kind of barometer of this because I've been doing it for so long, and when I started talking about these things in Britain in the early 1990s, well, it was just extraordinary the scale of
[00:11:42.214 --> 00:11:48.124]  uh... abuse and uh... and ridicule that came my way but as the years have passed uh... died
[00:11:49.698 --> 00:12:13.935]  uh... gradually change and then since 9-11 and another shift after the invasion of iraq i've seen it explode and what we're seeing now is something i talked about a long time ago when something is uh... covertly manipulating along a road to change society in a certain way there comes a point where it has to break the surface where it can be seen because that
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.441]  We're good to go.
[00:12:42.139 --> 00:12:44.720]  There's a consciousness awakening as well, very clearly.
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:51.222]  People are waking up and expanding their consciousness on a scale never before in a time that I've known anyway.
[00:12:51.743 --> 00:12:57.945]  And together it's bringing people to a state of awareness where they are seeing
[00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.920]  What is actually happening now?
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.801]  We need to go to the next stage now.
[00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.363]  People are coming out listening to this information in vast numbers.
[00:13:06.383 --> 00:13:08.924]  They're listening to programs like yours in vast numbers.
[00:13:09.324 --> 00:13:24.332]  What we need to do now is start to get together, drop the fault lines between left and right and center and progressives and all this other stuff and religion and all the rest of it and come together and cross the street and start engaging with this system.
[00:13:24.912 --> 00:13:26.733]  And by engaging, ironically, I mean
[00:13:27.513 --> 00:13:41.103]  Disengaging with it, ceasing to allow it to enslave us, ceasing to cooperate with our own enslavement, because as I talked about last time I was on the show, there are six billion people plus now being manipulated.
[00:13:41.163 --> 00:13:44.946]  There is, at the core, a relative handful doing the manipulating.
[00:13:45.086 --> 00:13:55.013]  I see a way out of this, but we have to come together, and it's starting, and I'm extremely optimistic, because now we're in this window of time where
[00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:59.106]  The problem is they're blatantly in front of us.
[00:13:59.126 --> 00:14:08.918]  The game is more and more blatantly in front of us, and that is engaging and focusing people to the understanding that doing nothing is no longer an option.
[00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:10.821]  It's a great time of opportunity, this.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:26.455]  And they only are able to control us by us ourselves, keeping ourselves in that box, in self-regulating to where we're afraid to speak up, or afraid to talk to neighbors, and so we just go and watch the television.
[00:14:27.215 --> 00:14:29.197]  But again, that is starting to break up.
[00:14:29.338 --> 00:14:32.481]  That is starting to shift, and it's so beautiful to see.
[00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:53.300]  Before we get into the larger shifts in society and how there's only probably less than a hundred global masterminds, a few thousand technicians under them who really get the full structure of the New World Order, there are tens of millions worldwide who have organically reverse-engineered what they're doing to a stunning level.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.742]  We're able to predict what they're going to do.
[00:14:55.742 --> 00:15:02.604]  And that's really starting to threaten them, and that's why they're talking about bringing in total dictatorial martial law to try to suppress it.
[00:15:03.004 --> 00:15:05.464]  I see that act of desperation as a huge failure.
[00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:15.726]  But let's get into the economics first, and break down what we're seeing with the banker takeover, how they're proposing a world banking system out of the crisis they created.
[00:15:20.223 --> 00:15:35.119]  I've been so focused on everything that I've been traveling and moving constantly for about 10 days, two weeks, but I have heard the idea that this banking crisis is like bad for the bankers and is not what they wanted.
[00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:38.524]  We've got to understand a few things.
[00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:44.910]  First of all, the people who are manipulating the banking system do not own just the banks.
[00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:45.931]  They own the game.
[00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:46.771]  They own the system.
[00:15:47.292 --> 00:15:55.139]  Now, if you own football, it doesn't matter if one team beats another team or another team beats the other team, because you own the game.
[00:15:55.179 --> 00:15:55.959]  You can't lose.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.581]  So, just because
[00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:04.775]  Merrill Lynch is absorbed by the Bank of America or this bank that goes down and its clientele is taken over by this bank.
[00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:12.019]  It doesn't matter because the names on the doors are changing, the masks on the face are changing, but you own the game!
[00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.200]  Those are just cutouts!
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.240]  Exactly!
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:20.804]  And if you own the game, you can manipulate the game because you're controlling the rules of the game.
[00:16:21.244 --> 00:16:22.445]  So what we're looking at is
[00:16:23.206 --> 00:16:27.429]  And this has been long predicted, and this is one of the real powerful things, Alex, at this time.
[00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:45.181]  And why it was so important to get this information out about the game and how it's played and what the goals are over the years gone by, because that gives credibility when people look at it and say, hold on a second, this was predicted, this is not just happening now.
[00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:48.303]  And this really does start to take power from
[00:16:48.984 --> 00:16:54.094]  Uh, the way they manipulate, giving us the impression that, oh no, this is just a problem that's just come out of nothing.
[00:16:54.134 --> 00:16:54.535]  No, no, no.
[00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:56.920]  It's been planned for years, and the plan is...
[00:16:57.739 --> 00:17:07.166]  For a centralization of power in every area of our lives and every area of global society including politics, business and all the rest of it.
[00:17:07.206 --> 00:17:09.088]  Now crucial to that is banking.
[00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:19.516]  They want a world central bank that dictates to the whole of the global financial system, the whole of the global banking industry and their families are going to control that.
[00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:20.236]  That's the idea.
[00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:25.965]  Diversity is the worst nightmare of the dictator.
[00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:36.251]  You look at any tyranny, if you want to centralize power, it's no good having lots and lots of points of decision-making and diversity of decision-making because you can't centrally control that.
[00:17:36.871 --> 00:17:39.753]  And just look at the way society's gone through the centuries.
[00:17:40.373 --> 00:17:41.554]  It's exactly the same way.
[00:17:41.674 --> 00:17:43.455]  Centralization of power constantly.
[00:17:43.895 --> 00:17:50.359]  Because you can only control from the center in the hands of a few if your center holds the power that affects
[00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:51.540]  I think so.
[00:18:09.634 --> 00:18:14.856]  A power you want to remove as much as you can, the number of names, the number of, the amount of diversity.
[00:18:14.956 --> 00:18:32.422]  And that's why the high-level private central banks that are not your regular Main Street banks issued over a thousand trillion liquidity to other banks and institutions and changed the rules so they could sell derivatives and get into all this fraud because now the elite above get to orchestrate the consolidation.
[00:18:32.482 --> 00:18:33.983]  They get to send down the regulators.
[00:18:34.263 --> 00:18:36.304]  They get to send the tax money to the central
[00:18:37.085 --> 00:18:37.285]  I think?
[00:18:53.865 --> 00:18:59.807]  The Financial Times of London said, actually, this is good for a few megabanks, and they're the ones that changed the rules.
[00:19:00.167 --> 00:19:03.848]  Meanwhile, you have all these people in alternative media running around saying, oh no, it's an accident.
[00:19:04.108 --> 00:19:04.648]  It's an accident.
[00:19:04.688 --> 00:19:21.213]  It's key for the establishment, the controllers, to sell that lie, so they don't get the blame for what they've orchestrated, so they can play the part of the savior, setting up the World Banking Cartel, which we buy carbon credits from, which are a tax on human breathing,
[00:19:21.793 --> 00:19:31.002]  Not all the real environmental problems we have so they can regulate our everyday life with carbon checkpoints and carbon audits of our homes and bureaucracy and one-child policy.
[00:19:31.863 --> 00:19:34.686]  Yeah, you see, this is a big point to get across.
[00:19:35.386 --> 00:19:43.634]  People, and I understand why, because that's what they're led to believe, they see private banks and they see the central banks in the different countries as
[00:19:44.415 --> 00:19:45.176]  I think so.
[00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:07.640]  The World Central Bank, and therefore they will control the system.
[00:20:07.841 --> 00:20:11.664]  The names will be different, but the system will be controlled by them.
[00:20:11.684 --> 00:20:12.144]  That's right.
[00:20:12.204 --> 00:20:13.406]  The system equals control.
[00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:14.246]  That's the whole idea.
[00:20:14.366 --> 00:20:15.968]  David, let's finish up with this topic.
[00:20:15.988 --> 00:20:20.712]  Because one unit all around the world, they move as one unit because they have a central control system.
[00:20:20.732 --> 00:20:21.393]  David, stop there.
[00:20:21.433 --> 00:20:22.374]  Let's back up about a minute.
[00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:24.535]  I want you to be able to finish that point when we come back.
[00:20:24.736 --> 00:20:25.216]  Stay with us.
[00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:33.391]  Drinking a chlorophyll-rich beverage has been found to benefit your entire body.

[00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:36.135]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:21:36.455 --> 00:21:38.456]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:21:39.096 --> 00:21:40.157]  But who is the enemy?
[00:21:40.657 --> 00:21:41.157]  Bin Laden.
[00:21:41.437 --> 00:21:42.418]  This is his MO.
[00:21:42.438 --> 00:21:43.738]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:21:43.778 --> 00:21:45.299]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:52.546]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:53.407]  Some U.S.
[00:21:53.447 --> 00:21:59.192]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:21:59.793 --> 00:22:03.256]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:04.216]  The headlines are clear.
[00:22:31.656 --> 00:22:34.259]  The worldwide economic collapse is here.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.263]  The military is being positioned for martial law.
[00:22:37.424 --> 00:22:39.466]  The mark of the beast is at hand.
[00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:42.911]  Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[00:22:42.971 --> 00:22:45.674]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope.
[00:22:45.734 --> 00:22:46.615]  To stay free.
[00:22:47.636 --> 00:22:51.058]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit.
[00:22:51.298 --> 00:22:54.599]  24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.
[00:22:54.659 --> 00:22:57.380]  For true patriots and homesteaders wanting food insurance.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.142]  That's over 5 pounds of rare historic seeds for a penny per seed.
[00:23:02.162 --> 00:23:05.303]  15,000 seeds that will feed a family healthy food for 7 years.
[00:23:05.323 --> 00:23:14.427]  Big John Lipska, host of Don't Tread on Me, is including an instructional DVD that will teach you how to earn big money selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him.
[00:23:14.487 --> 00:23:16.908]  Restaurants and small delis don't buy from copycats.
[00:23:17.048 --> 00:23:17.308]  We're good.
[00:23:29.515 --> 00:23:32.777]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[00:23:32.957 --> 00:23:37.039]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:48.644]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[00:23:48.864 --> 00:23:54.667]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[00:23:54.947 --> 00:23:55.568]  We're good to go.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.003]  All right, folks, we're back live with David Eich, our guest for the Balance of the Radio Show today.
[00:24:20.043 --> 00:24:24.066]  We'll open the phones up towards the end of the show in the next hour.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:48.051]  The key here is that the unprecedented action out in the open of the president
[00:24:48.906 --> 00:24:57.090]  All the major leaders of the two parties, the Treasury Secretary is saying, there's going to be a depression, financial abyss, you've got to pass this Banker Bailout Bill.
[00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:12.477]  And you read the bill, immunity, unlimited power, they can do whatever they want, commit basically any financial crime they want, and it doesn't say $850 billion, doesn't say $700 billion, it says $5 trillion, if you really read the fine print, as Bloomberg Financial and others reported.
[00:25:12.737 --> 00:25:15.599]  So they are the ones terrorizing the market to plunge.
[00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:19.565]  Then they forced through the bill, and last Friday we had the congressman on.
[00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:21.668]  It was on C-SPAN.
[00:25:22.349 --> 00:25:25.394]  They were threatened with physical martial law, David.
[00:25:26.201 --> 00:25:27.682]  I know you've been traveling, you may not know this.
[00:25:27.702 --> 00:25:28.763]  We can play the clip if you want to hear it.
[00:25:29.164 --> 00:25:32.247]  They were threatened with martial law if they didn't pass it.
[00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:36.951]  Now CNN, BBC, Army Times are reporting the Army is to be used during riots.
[00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:39.173]  But again, problem, reaction, solution.
[00:25:39.233 --> 00:25:46.360]  They implode the economy, the welfare checks stop going out, things break down, there's riots, the military saves us, the precedent is set.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.604]  So just amazing how they're right out in the open doing all of this, David.
[00:25:51.224 --> 00:26:00.686]  Yeah, because we've reached that point, Alex, where it has to break the surface to become the changes in society that they've been working covertly for for so long.
[00:26:01.266 --> 00:26:09.187]  This is the key, in terms of America, for what's happening on so many levels, in my opinion anyway, and I've been writing this for years.
[00:26:09.907 --> 00:26:14.688]  And what I said was that they're going to use America, or are using America, to destroy America.
[00:26:14.988 --> 00:26:15.268]  Why?
[00:26:15.849 --> 00:26:18.409]  Because they want a world government
[00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:38.571]  A world government cannot possibly have total global power while there's any superpower with massive military and financial might that has, through that, the ability to say to the world government, excuse me, we're not doing that, we're not accepting what you're dictating and telling us to do.
[00:26:39.091 --> 00:26:45.673]  So what they've been doing, and it's been so blatant to me, is that they are using America to destroy America.
[00:26:45.973 --> 00:26:47.174]  First of all, militarily.
[00:26:47.734 --> 00:26:53.396]  They're stretching America all over the place militarily and weakening them on that level.
[00:26:53.676 --> 00:26:57.877]  And now they're attacking the American economy on a massive scale.
[00:26:57.917 --> 00:27:07.979]  And this trillion, as you rightly say, basically open checkbook, so-called bailout, is not designed to solve the crisis.
[00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:09.720]  It's designed to further
[00:27:10.582 --> 00:27:16.626]  Massively undermine the American economy and American financial security.
[00:27:16.966 --> 00:27:19.368]  And who's holding this debt now?
[00:27:20.429 --> 00:27:22.450]  Goodness knows how much more debt that's coming in.
[00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.272]  And the debt that's already owed by America.
[00:27:25.332 --> 00:27:27.714]  Not that it is debt, it's money that doesn't exist.
[00:27:28.054 --> 00:27:28.654]  It's a scam.
[00:27:28.874 --> 00:27:32.017]  But people like China are holding massive amounts of this.
[00:27:32.077 --> 00:27:35.559]  And I found it very interesting, you know, that Henry Paulson
[00:27:36.349 --> 00:27:36.829]  I think so.
[00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:52.776]  I think so.
[00:28:08.965 --> 00:28:10.566]  You're going to see the action start.
[00:28:11.206 --> 00:28:15.828]  And what happens when China says, hold on a second, we own we all hold all this debt.
[00:28:16.409 --> 00:28:18.370]  Therefore, you know, you're not paying us back.
[00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.810]  You get any more and more trouble.
[00:28:20.111 --> 00:28:22.772]  We want the assets, please, for the debt that we hold.
[00:28:23.752 --> 00:28:27.694]  Then you've got potential for conflict between the two.
[00:28:27.734 --> 00:28:30.296]  And I was told a long time ago that
[00:28:31.136 --> 00:28:41.684]  It's leading to a conflict involving China, the third world war, to bring in finally this whole structure of world government, world central bank, world army, microchip population, world currency, and all the rest of it.
[00:28:42.025 --> 00:28:45.307]  So all these things are moving as one unit.
[00:28:45.427 --> 00:28:48.209]  They appear to be, to most people, unconnected.
[00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:54.494]  As you look at the invasion of Iraq, and Afghanistan, and the finances, all moved by one flow of energy.
[00:28:57.316 --> 00:29:04.945]  That was also meant to demonize the name of the U.S., to put the sins of the new world order on the U.S., like they used the Soviets previously to carry out their dirty work.
[00:29:04.965 --> 00:29:11.292]  They also need a global economic crisis that can be blamed on America to set up their world government.
[00:29:11.612 --> 00:29:17.940]  And now, all over the financial papers the last two weeks, they propose the private banks becoming the world government.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.121]  I mean, that is so unbelievable!
[00:29:20.141 --> 00:29:32.665]  I was reading a piece when I was traveling about the head of the IMF saying that the IMF should become the central coordinating, basically, police force for the global banking system.
[00:29:32.685 --> 00:29:40.048]  There's the open suggestion now of this world central bank that we've been talking about for so long.
[00:29:40.628 --> 00:29:43.349]  And so what we're looking at is
[00:29:44.578 --> 00:30:07.410]  Ironically, while America is getting this flag, while America gets the thinker pointed at it, actually, although it's firing the bullets, if you like, in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and what have you, the gun's being loaded in Europe, and there in Europe, you know, in the centre of the secret society web, Europe is basically going, who me?
[00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.311]  I've got nothing to do with it, it's America!
[00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.333]  Got a break when I come back long segment.
[00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:18.920]  I want to hear your solutions how to combat this now I say expose is really behind it a but what else can we do?
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:26.367]  We're on the march the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:30:29.759 --> 00:30:30.961]  I am so frustrated.
[00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:33.204]  I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[00:30:33.404 --> 00:30:33.725]  What?
[00:30:33.985 --> 00:30:36.568]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[00:30:36.749 --> 00:30:38.010]  I read something and forget.
[00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:39.352]  I forget people's names.
[00:30:39.432 --> 00:30:43.077]  I hear all this great information on the radio and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[00:30:43.217 --> 00:30:44.859]  I... Okay, slow down.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.363]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[00:30:47.523 --> 00:30:54.549]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum in deodorants, genetically modified foods, the way the education system taught you.
[00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:56.150]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:57.811]  You know, I can remember everything now.
[00:30:58.031 --> 00:30:58.972]  Even entire books.
[00:30:59.212 --> 00:30:59.393]  What?
[00:30:59.493 --> 00:30:59.793]  How?
[00:31:00.053 --> 00:31:03.236]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:06.959]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:12.203]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information,
[00:31:12.603 --> 00:31:12.743]  Wow.
[00:31:12.803 --> 00:31:13.744]  What's the website?
[00:31:29.933 --> 00:31:42.640]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:46.902]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:31:47.242 --> 00:31:53.766]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:31:54.127 --> 00:31:57.349]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:05.054]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:32:23.714 --> 00:32:29.041]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.571]  Hello, I'm Steve Shang.
[00:32:32.052 --> 00:32:39.179]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished stocking up on food.
[00:32:39.199 --> 00:32:49.309]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing, and unemployment crashes that we're desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water.
[00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:50.690]  Well, snap out of it.
[00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:51.731]  We now have a deadline.
[00:32:52.211 --> 00:32:53.693]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[00:32:54.253 --> 00:33:05.578]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to make unpopular decisions.
[00:33:06.139 --> 00:33:11.841]  Well, I take the general at his word and my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to the inauguration.
[00:33:12.302 --> 00:33:17.184]  Contact efoodsdirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[00:33:17.724 --> 00:33:21.466]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.288]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web efoodsdirect.com
[00:33:35.325 --> 00:33:47.613]  Instead of the states getting rid of some of the three million police, or all the welfare, or all the largesse to get people domesticated, and all the spending, and the billions per major city, you've got billions per city.
[00:33:48.014 --> 00:33:50.495]  New York's had five billion in cameras put in the last four years.
[00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:53.717]  Boston in one year had two billion dollars worth of cameras put in.
[00:33:54.078 --> 00:33:59.842]  Homeland Security's now announced all those free federal traffic cameras, they were DARPA designed by the Pentagon to watch you.
[00:34:00.162 --> 00:34:01.403]  They're scanning your faces.
[00:34:03.151 --> 00:34:07.434]  Now, instead of doing any of that, they are saying they're going to bail out all the states.
[00:34:07.454 --> 00:34:10.497]  $7 billion for California, $5 billion for Florida.
[00:34:11.157 --> 00:34:16.882]  They're going to, quote, bail out select crony corporations owned by the same private central banks.
[00:34:17.883 --> 00:34:23.668]  The stock market's down by 700-plus points right now, and plunging, dwarfing what happened last Monday.
[00:34:23.888 --> 00:34:28.551]  They promised you if you submitted and gave them unlimited power, they'd be nice to you.
[00:34:29.292 --> 00:34:33.833]  And now there's debates on talk radio and TV about, did they say the bailout would do that?
[00:34:34.474 --> 00:34:35.894]  Or are people making that up?
[00:34:37.715 --> 00:34:40.716]  They know the public doesn't have a memory for last week, or does the public?
[00:34:41.076 --> 00:34:46.477]  David, I want to finish up with the economy and get into the nature of reality, but there seems to be a shocking of the conscious.
[00:34:47.358 --> 00:34:57.561]  And I've seen that in some psychological tests they've done at major universities studying rodent psychology, which is very similar to human group psychology, in these controlled mazes.
[00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:05.208]  Shocking, yelling, noise, heat, cold on rats, till they finally just go into a catatonic state and shake in the corner.
[00:35:05.828 --> 00:35:13.415]  And, you know, having CBS News come out and say, Mercury is good for your brain, taking mercury shots helps your brain cells.
[00:35:13.555 --> 00:35:14.776]  Now, that's an actual newscast.
[00:35:14.836 --> 00:35:16.057]  I've played it 50 times.
[00:35:16.077 --> 00:35:17.679]  I'm not going to play it today, but if you want, I'll play it.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.964]  Or, I've got MSNBC saying, actually, poison in food is good for China.
[00:35:23.064 --> 00:35:24.265]  We need poison in the food.
[00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:44.830]  And then tens of thousands, just finishing up this statement, tens of thousands get sick from melamine on purpose in the milk because it shows on a protein test, if somebody tested that it has high protein, and then it turns out it's in a bunch of food lines here in the U.S.
[00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.112]  where most of the food additives and drugs get made for the U.S.
[00:35:47.132 --> 00:35:53.157]  and now in China, same for Europe, and they admit it's killing hundreds of Chinese that drank too much
[00:35:53.817 --> 00:35:54.237]  Well, this will...
[00:36:12.906 --> 00:36:17.128]  It's very clear, when you put it all together, Alex, when you put all the shocks, all the constant instructions, all the do's and don'ts,
[00:36:39.111 --> 00:36:53.166]  All the punishments for increasingly fine detail little things like I talked about last time, people being fined in Britain for feeding the birds, people being fined for putting a card in their car saying it's for sale when it's their own car.
[00:36:53.806 --> 00:36:57.931]  What it is like is exactly like the laboratory rat because of course when you
[00:36:59.003 --> 00:37:03.745]  Uh, when they're doing those experiments, um, when the rat goes down certain channels, it gets the shock.
[00:37:04.725 --> 00:37:14.489]  After a few shocks, it doesn't go down that channel anymore, and you can take the shock equipment away, it still won't go down that channel, because it's been programmed not to do that by, by the carrot and the stick.
[00:37:14.529 --> 00:37:16.590]  It's okay going down this one, we'll leave you alone.
[00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.210]  Go down that one, there's a problem.
[00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.411]  Now, take this on a mass scale.
[00:37:21.295 --> 00:37:21.575]  All right.
[00:37:39.984 --> 00:37:40.925]  Well, here's an example.
[00:37:41.065 --> 00:37:50.009]  In England and the U.S., if an adult is at the park, and I, you know, when I was single, went for walks at the park all the time, or jogs, the police come over and ask, are you a pedophile?
[00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:51.269]  I mean, how bizarre.
[00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:54.731]  Or, um, Steve Watson,
[00:37:55.271 --> 00:37:58.074]  Out for a date in London, they come over and put him in a terror database.
[00:37:58.114 --> 00:38:02.278]  Clean cut, nice looking guy, with a master's degree in political science, with a great looking girlfriend.
[00:38:03.419 --> 00:38:05.541]  Everybody I know in England has had this happen to them.
[00:38:05.561 --> 00:38:08.664]  It happened to me when I was there, where they put me in a terror database.
[00:38:08.924 --> 00:38:10.926]  They're letting you know you're a slave.
[00:38:11.727 --> 00:38:13.429]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:19.555]  It's something that is very important for people to appreciate.
[00:38:20.215 --> 00:38:21.256]  We're good to go.
[00:38:33.807 --> 00:38:40.552]  When the tasers started coming out, when we started giving... I'm not saying all police are like this, but... But now they've gotten us conditioned to daily deaths.
[00:38:40.693 --> 00:38:45.857]  Yeah, I've met a few policemen who, if they had a brain cell, it would die of loneliness.
[00:38:46.197 --> 00:38:50.661]  And we're giving these people 55,000 volts of electricity to shoot at people.
[00:38:50.701 --> 00:38:58.788]  Now, there was an article in the newspaper which was looking at this when they first came in, and the headline encapsulated exactly what we're talking about here.
[00:38:58.808 --> 00:38:59.549]  It said,
[00:39:00.331 --> 00:39:02.291]  I'll do anything you say, officer.
[00:39:02.712 --> 00:39:04.452]  Just don't use that thing on me.
[00:39:04.932 --> 00:39:08.253]  And that encapsulates this whole mind game.
[00:39:08.333 --> 00:39:09.293]  It's a cattle prod!
[00:39:09.593 --> 00:39:13.534]  It's a cattle prod for cows in this slaughterhouse.
[00:39:13.594 --> 00:39:14.334]  It's a cattle prod.
[00:39:14.354 --> 00:39:14.654]  Go ahead.
[00:39:15.054 --> 00:39:15.534]  Exactly.
[00:39:16.094 --> 00:39:25.416]  But what we mustn't do, and when we get into the nature of reality and the true nature of who we are, as opposed to the false identity we've been sold from cradle to grave,
[00:39:25.976 --> 00:39:30.018]  Then you lose the fear, and you lose this subservience.
[00:39:30.258 --> 00:39:41.064]  You know, someone with an expanded consciousness, who looks in the mirror and realizes that what they're looking at is what they're experiencing, not who they are, they don't fall for this stuff.
[00:39:41.144 --> 00:39:47.067]  And that's why this awakening, and it's an awakening from an hypnotic trance, that's what it is.
[00:39:47.107 --> 00:39:47.307]  Yes!
[00:39:47.327 --> 00:39:50.568]  Calling it an awakening is a very good term, because that's what it is.
[00:39:50.648 --> 00:39:51.409]  It's like someone
[00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.689]  We're good.
[00:40:14.441 --> 00:40:17.584]  And by the way, the first step is the biggest.
[00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:29.094]  Once you realize you are in a hypnotic state with your literal brainwaves from the television, the average American now, the average Brit, they've done studies, we've posted them on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:29.114 --> 00:40:30.516]  I've also seen them on DavidIke.com.
[00:40:31.296 --> 00:40:38.425]  That people are now in a lower brainwave state than they were just 30-40 years ago.
[00:40:38.525 --> 00:40:41.108]  People are in a sleep state.
[00:40:41.148 --> 00:40:44.372]  They are in a glazed-eyed state.
[00:40:44.412 --> 00:40:46.515]  And what David is telling you is absolutely true.
[00:40:48.211 --> 00:41:12.877]  Yeah, well when you start to look at what reality is, then this conspiracy takes on a whole new depth, and indeed you get closer and closer to the foundations of it, because the foundations of it, it plays out as banking scams, it plays out as political scams, it plays out as engineered wars, all of which are absolutely vital for us to know about, because you can't cease to be a slave until you realize you are one and what the game is, so that's vital information.
[00:41:13.258 --> 00:41:14.418]  But alongside that,
[00:41:15.158 --> 00:41:21.841]  We need to understand not just what the prison looks like, but how we open the door and indeed stop the door finally slamming shut.
[00:41:22.341 --> 00:41:35.887]  And to do that, we need to understand reality because the core people, behind the people, behind the people, the shadow people as I call them, they understand the nature of the reality that we're experiencing and they have
[00:41:36.907 --> 00:41:37.808]  We're good to go.
[00:41:52.522 --> 00:41:56.484]  Be free in a world that we don't even know what the world is.
[00:41:56.544 --> 00:41:57.745]  We don't know who we are.
[00:41:58.025 --> 00:42:00.466]  We don't know the nature of the reality we're experiencing.
[00:42:00.766 --> 00:42:11.311]  If we don't start to get an understanding of that information, then again, just like the banking system, we're pawns in a game where someone else knows the rules and we don't.
[00:42:11.791 --> 00:42:13.772]  And that's why this whole area of
[00:42:14.392 --> 00:42:15.033]  Who are we?
[00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:15.813]  Where are we?
[00:42:16.074 --> 00:42:21.218]  What is the nature of reality is so absolutely vital, because it offers the key to the door.
[00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:30.946]  And that's why it's my prime focus now, because this is where the key is held to open the door to this prison cell that they're building by the minute.
[00:42:31.147 --> 00:42:37.672]  Now to simplify that, they are trying to shock us now and intensify the amount of outrageousness
[00:42:38.493 --> 00:42:55.496]  Well you know when they say Cadbury cakes filled with melamine are good for you, they're doing that because some even greater horrors and intensification of the tyranny is coming and they're trying to acclimate the mind to where we're so shocked that we're basically numb and so what you're saying
[00:42:55.836 --> 00:43:19.693]  And you're absolutely right from my perspective and my life and studying history and philosophy and sociology and what's happening is once you realize you're being manipulated, once you understand you're being programmed, once you understand that's going on, then you start looking and then it's a progression of levels as you become more and more aware and that's what the enemy is in a race to block and stop.
[00:43:20.553 --> 00:43:27.638]  Yeah, when you expand your consciousness, your energy field starts to vibrate quicker and quicker and quicker.
[00:43:28.538 --> 00:43:40.226]  As you close your consciousness and you become a prisoner almost entirely of the five senses in how you see reality, you see possibility, and the five senses
[00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:42.287]  Thank you very much.
[00:43:59.856 --> 00:44:00.216]  I think so, yes.
[00:44:27.751 --> 00:44:28.072]  I don't
[00:44:41.022 --> 00:44:42.343]  Thank you for having me.
[00:45:03.804 --> 00:45:06.027]  They look outside into this world.
[00:45:23.463 --> 00:45:28.610]  A historical example of horizons and expanding your vision.
[00:45:29.411 --> 00:45:31.854]  The elite, of course, have suppressed a lot of history.
[00:45:32.374 --> 00:45:35.338]  But they know that we are, quote, made in the image of the Creator.
[00:45:35.378 --> 00:45:37.060]  We are great creators.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.142]  We can build things.
[00:45:38.522 --> 00:45:41.845]  And that's why a science fiction writer like Jules Verne or H.G.
[00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:57.880]  Wells or any of these people, they could expand just their imagination and almost everything they wrote about and talked about has now manifest because what the mind imagines in steps it is able to later construct through this group community, this mass organism
[00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.482]  That we know of as humanity.
[00:46:00.682 --> 00:46:11.092]  So that's why the elite know to stop a true renaissance to the stars, they have to make us petty, small, hateful, to turn against each other, and fearful of taking action.
[00:46:11.112 --> 00:46:13.013]  Now, I say there's a balance there.
[00:46:13.053 --> 00:46:13.974]  People call it fear.
[00:46:15.015 --> 00:46:20.802]  When I say we've got to take action and go out and warn the people about the New World Order or they're going to enslave us, that isn't fear.
[00:46:21.323 --> 00:46:28.232]  I'm saying we have a positive way to stop this, but things will be bad if we don't.
[00:46:28.592 --> 00:46:30.675]  That's just telling people the lay of the land.
[00:46:31.355 --> 00:46:31.875]  Yeah, I mean...
[00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:08.257]  The biggest aspect of this whole conspiracy, Alex, in my view, is that they have manipulated humanity into a false sense of identity.
[00:47:08.757 --> 00:47:13.360]  It's a sense of identity that looks in the mirror in the morning and says, that is me.
[00:47:13.861 --> 00:47:15.061]  I am Chuck Jones.
[00:47:15.281 --> 00:47:16.542]  I am Ethel Smith.
[00:47:17.043 --> 00:47:25.228]  When we are consciousness, having an experience as Chuck Jones and Ethel Smith, and if you identify
[00:47:25.888 --> 00:47:26.088]  I think?
[00:47:41.016 --> 00:47:53.679]  That the prime, bottom line, foundation of this conspiracy is to put us in this fake identity where we identify with being human as human is what we are.
[00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:55.919]  Human is what we are experiencing.
[00:47:56.319 --> 00:48:10.422]  Now, when near-death experiences have these, now in their millions, recorded experiences of leaving the body when the body dies and then coming back again when the body is revived, they tell extraordinarily common
[00:48:11.354 --> 00:48:11.874]  We're good to go.
[00:48:40.718 --> 00:48:41.440]  Thank you very much.
[00:48:52.379 --> 00:48:59.344]  And in front of the eye appeared a telescope, and on the end of the telescope was the Earth and this universe.
[00:48:59.424 --> 00:49:04.687]  And then, this is the crucial point, the telescope morphed into a human body.
[00:49:05.187 --> 00:49:13.593]  And what the human body is, it's like a, well it is a biological computer, but what it does... It's your narrowly focused consciousness.
[00:49:16.394 --> 00:49:17.496]  See you next week.
[00:49:33.724 --> 00:49:37.625]  Mainstream science says exists in this universe, and there's a lot more than they've discovered yet.
[00:49:38.426 --> 00:49:45.988]  The electromagnetic spectrum is 0.005% of that, and visible light is a fraction of the 0.005%.
[00:49:47.729 --> 00:49:53.971]  That is the only frequency range that our eyes decode and our brain and genetic system decodes.
[00:49:54.471 --> 00:49:57.232]  And sharing the same space as this, if you like,
[00:49:58.186 --> 00:49:58.646]  We're good to go.
[00:50:21.159 --> 00:50:22.639]  I think so, yes.
[00:50:49.905 --> 00:51:02.893]  From cradle to grave, to believe that we are the vehicle which is focusing our consciousness to experience this reality, and that we are as limited as that vehicle perceives the world.
[00:51:03.293 --> 00:51:09.237]  That is how you can turn humanity, infinite consciousness, into infinite expressions, into a herd of sheep.
[00:51:09.657 --> 00:51:17.502]  When we break that understanding, when we move our point of observation from, I am Chuck Jones, I have no power, to I am infinite consciousness,
[00:51:17.983 --> 00:51:26.902]  Having an experience and I can take that understanding that power and I can change this reality because I know that we got a brain is that I am Then we have to break right now.
[00:51:26.942 --> 00:51:28.004]  We're gonna talk behind the scenes
[00:51:29.679 --> 00:51:35.104]  With Christmas right around the corner and an unstable economy looming, finding the right gift can be tough.
[00:51:35.384 --> 00:51:37.926]  Why not give the gift of an Excalibur dehydrator?

[00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:32.675]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[00:52:32.735 --> 00:52:35.859]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:38.161]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:38.862 --> 00:52:39.923]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:40.404 --> 00:52:40.944]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:41.225 --> 00:52:42.126]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:42.146 --> 00:52:43.467]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:43.487 --> 00:52:45.009]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:52.297]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:52.697 --> 00:52:53.158]  Some U.S.
[00:52:53.178 --> 00:52:58.944]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:59.544 --> 00:53:02.988]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:53:03.148 --> 00:53:05.831]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:34.109]  Hey GCN listeners, if you're looking for the perfect Christmas gift this year, listen up!
[00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:37.170]  This message is going to make holiday shopping very easy.
[00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:40.993]  This year, give the amazing Survival Seed Bank to friends and family.
[00:53:41.313 --> 00:53:41.893]  Here's why.
[00:53:42.153 --> 00:53:50.178]  The Survival Seed Bank will give any friend or loved one the ability to grow a full acre crisis garden of nutritionally dense, life-sustaining food.
[00:53:50.558 --> 00:53:54.301]  And the Survival Seed Bank is not just a box of open pollinated seeds.
[00:53:54.561 --> 00:53:59.005]  It's an indestructible, waterproof seed bank that can even be buried if necessary.
[00:53:59.305 --> 00:54:00.406]  And here's the best part.
[00:54:00.746 --> 00:54:05.510]  The price of Survival Seed Bank has been drastically reduced for GCN listeners this Christmas.
[00:54:05.911 --> 00:54:07.772]  You might even want to pick one up for yourself.
[00:54:08.072 --> 00:54:09.714]  The price goes back up January 1st.
[00:54:10.154 --> 00:54:11.095]  They don't want to see us, you and I
[00:54:42.057 --> 00:54:46.499]  All they want us to do is keep on killing one another.
[00:55:05.009 --> 00:55:06.992]  What an amazing discussion with David Icke.
[00:55:07.032 --> 00:55:11.136]  During the breaks, we're doing some behind-the-scenes talking, but I'd like to keep it congruent with the full audience.
[00:55:11.757 --> 00:55:16.202]  You can go over to the InfoWars.com streams, the PrisonPlanet.com streams.
[00:55:16.223 --> 00:55:23.431]  Those are separate from many others, including Genesis, and hear the expanded interview there or watch on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:23.471 --> 00:55:23.952]  Don't forget,
[00:55:24.532 --> 00:55:27.353]  With your PresidentPlanet.tv membership, you make what we do here possible.
[00:55:27.373 --> 00:55:31.715]  You get all my films in super high quality to burn them to the desk and give to folks a factory of resistance.
[00:55:32.916 --> 00:55:45.341]  All my films, 20 of them now, 19 I made, 20th I produced, my book and so many other great books and videos we carry are available at InfoWars.com and it is your funding of our operation that allows us to continue.
[00:55:45.361 --> 00:55:48.462]  But the most important thing is the materials are waking people up and people
[00:55:49.743 --> 00:55:53.706]  Are more ready to receive this information than ever before.
[00:55:53.786 --> 00:56:04.757]  Another great place to find out a lot of shocking information, which regardless will open your horizons, make you question, and regardless of whether it's all correct or not, it is extremely positive to question.
[00:56:05.457 --> 00:56:09.621]  And I see that's the genius of David Icke, and I really agree with him on 98% of what he covers.
[00:56:10.021 --> 00:56:12.063]  I just haven't been able to tangibly prove the other 2%.
[00:56:13.284 --> 00:56:24.931]  My gut tells me, and I hope for God's sake it's probably true, but the point is, is that I stick to what I can prove more in this plane of existence, because I've found that's more successful with people who aren't further down the research line.
[00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:32.056]  Everybody should visit davideike.com, just google David Icke, and of course you spell his name, I-C-K-E,
[00:56:34.757 --> 00:56:38.480]  And he's got a lot of great books and videos available there at DavidIke.com.
[00:57:05.258 --> 00:57:05.378]  Yes.
[00:57:21.476 --> 00:57:21.796]  Thank you.
[00:57:42.249 --> 00:57:45.232]  Everything in the end comes down to a vibrational state.
[00:57:45.272 --> 00:57:47.254]  The lower it is, the more limited you are.
[00:57:48.335 --> 00:57:56.423]  The more narrow-minded, I would say narrow-banded you are, the more you expand your consciousness, the more the energy vibrates quicker.
[00:57:58.645 --> 00:58:01.246]  We are experiencing a band of frequencies.
[00:58:01.286 --> 00:58:04.307]  Now, our consciousness is vibrating too quickly to interact with it.
[00:58:05.047 --> 00:58:17.830]  If my consciousness tried to interact with this book on this table in front of me, I couldn't pick it up, just as Radio A couldn't interact with Radio 2, because they share the same space, but they're not close enough on the dial to interact with each other.
[00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:21.671]  So consciousness takes on an outer shell that is vibrating.
[00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:22.551]  I think?
[00:58:37.441 --> 00:58:37.821]  I think so.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:09.273]  You're in a state of seeing everything as a part, which is the perfect vehicle, the perfect landscape to bring about divide and rule to different religions and... One minute!
[00:59:09.553 --> 00:59:15.200]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:17.443]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:59:25.717 --> 00:59:27.018]  It's an inside job!
[00:59:27.078 --> 00:59:28.219]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:59:28.239 --> 00:59:29.839]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:37.064]  How do the American people know that 9-11 wasn't staged, wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the C.A.R.?
[00:59:37.464 --> 00:59:46.089]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door!
[00:59:46.129 --> 00:59:50.692]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, the global awakening has taken place.
[00:59:58.884 --> 01:00:02.286]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:00:02.427 --> 01:00:04.808]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:10.633]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that.
[01:00:10.653 --> 01:00:11.654]  Truth Rising.
[01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:14.276]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[01:00:14.516 --> 01:00:16.478]  Or get the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:00:16.758 --> 01:00:19.320]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[01:00:22.302 --> 01:00:24.244]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:24.684 --> 01:00:27.487]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:36.021 --> 01:00:39.022]  We are now into hour number four on the internet streams.
[01:00:39.242 --> 01:00:41.803]  We are number one on shoutcast period.
[01:00:41.924 --> 01:00:45.605]  Number one on the web for radio on the internet.
[01:00:45.665 --> 01:00:46.866]  And we're not just on the internet.
[01:00:46.886 --> 01:00:48.607]  We're on AM and FM, shortwave satellite.
[01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:49.888]  We thank all those affiliates.
[01:00:49.948 --> 01:00:50.588]  Okay, David Icke.
[01:00:51.068 --> 01:01:02.714]  Finishing up with the nature of reality and then expanding into not just the positive reality and love and light and goodness, but then we're going to get into the dark side and what makes up the enemy.
[01:01:02.754 --> 01:01:03.855]  People need to understand that.
[01:01:03.915 --> 01:01:04.315]  David Icke.
[01:01:05.235 --> 01:01:19.242]  Well, this is the key, and this might, you know, shock a few people when they think about it, but this reality that we are experiencing as solid walls and an apparently solid world is just an illusion.
[01:01:19.823 --> 01:01:25.946]  The only place it exists is in our heads, and it is what I call the holographic internet.
[01:01:27.106 --> 01:01:34.711]  I'm in this room now, and if I look around, the wireless internet is in this room, but I can't see it.
[01:01:35.212 --> 01:01:47.160]  But if I get a computer and I tune it into the wireless internet, suddenly I have a complete worldwide collective reality called the World Wide Web, which can be accessed anywhere in China,
[01:01:47.856 --> 01:01:48.076]  I don't
[01:02:03.484 --> 01:02:10.549]  If you said to people, tell me about the Internet, they'd say, well, it's graphics and websites and colors on a screen.
[01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:11.930]  Yes, it is.
[01:02:12.091 --> 01:02:14.953]  But the only place the Internet exists in that form is on the screen.
[01:02:14.993 --> 01:02:15.493]  Nowhere else.
[01:02:15.593 --> 01:02:17.434]  Everywhere else it's electronic circuits, etc.
[01:02:18.075 --> 01:02:19.776]  You say to people, tell me about television.
[01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:22.017]  They say, well, it's programs that are moving pictures on the screen.
[01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:22.498]  Yes, it is.
[01:02:23.138 --> 01:02:26.300]  But the only place that television exists in that form is on the screen.
[01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:32.685]  Everywhere else it is electronic circuits and frequency fields which the television decodes into those pixels.
[01:02:33.567 --> 01:02:44.918]  What we do through this physical vehicle, what we call physical anyway, is we're decoding a reality on exactly the same principle, though fantastically more sophisticated, as the wireless internet.
[01:02:45.358 --> 01:02:47.320]  And this is where we get our collective reality from.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.764]  Now this is vital to the conspiracy, Alex, because
[01:02:51.713 --> 01:03:00.899]  If you know this and the people don't, then you can manipulate the way they decode reality to fit what you want those people to do.
[01:03:01.219 --> 01:03:03.521]  What is that stage hypnotist doing on a stage?
[01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:07.023]  He is manipulating the stoogiest sense of reality.
[01:03:07.143 --> 01:03:09.105]  In other words, the way they decode reality.
[01:03:09.505 --> 01:03:12.767]  So he'll give one, for instance, a potato and he'll
[01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:20.180]  I'll eat the potato, but he beforehand will have programmed the brain, the decoding system, to believe that it's an apple.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:29.362]  So as the message goes from the taste buds to the brain, as an electrical signal, the brain decodes that not as a potato, but as an apple.
[01:03:29.422 --> 01:03:33.043]  You try telling that guy he's not eating an apple, because he's tasting it.
[01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:36.983]  I went to stage images shows when I was researching all this, and I watched it happen.
[01:03:37.243 --> 01:03:40.684]  I watched people reel back with fantastic smells.
[01:03:41.884 --> 01:04:01.188]  Well it shows predictive programming and they have those TV shows where they really do it and they found in studies that the population is more suggestible, massively more suggestible than they were just 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago.
[01:04:01.428 --> 01:04:05.749]  We're being programmed by TV to be more suggestible and now everything's like
[01:04:06.849 --> 01:04:16.573]  You know, Times Square, where they're taking over reality with blimps and with TV screens, and where everything is becoming this Minority Report world.
[01:04:18.113 --> 01:04:27.337]  And because they know that this information I'm talking about now, they understand this at the shallow people level, and they are programming just like hypnotists.
[01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:28.258]  I think so.
[01:04:44.899 --> 01:04:45.680]  And that's what we are.
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:05:08.972]  We're all these individual biomechanical machines marching around the surface of a giant planetoid covered by oceans and a thin ribbon of atmosphere who are all individually experiencing just a very narrow band of reality and then they're even trying to program that narrow band and use our social conditioning to keep us in very small parameters, David, correct?
[01:05:09.412 --> 01:05:16.616]  They're trying to isolate us in the body consciousness vehicle, which has an ability to think for itself.
[01:05:16.696 --> 01:05:18.136]  It's not just like an ordinary computer.
[01:05:18.557 --> 01:05:19.817]  It's a biological computer.
[01:05:19.837 --> 01:05:23.439]  It has the ability to think for itself and react to environmental changes.
[01:05:23.479 --> 01:05:24.900]  That's what we call physical evolution.
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.060]  David, we're going to skip this break.
[01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:26.941]  It's too important.
[01:05:27.081 --> 01:05:29.382]  Only on the InfoWars streams and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:30.102 --> 01:05:33.224]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history.
[01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:36.446]  A terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:05:36.786 --> 01:05:38.447]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:05:39.427 --> 01:05:40.447]  But who is the enemy?
[01:05:40.968 --> 01:05:41.508]  Bin Laden.
[01:05:41.748 --> 01:05:42.568]  This is his M.O.
[01:05:42.608 --> 01:05:44.108]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:45.809]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:05:46.129 --> 01:05:52.871]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:05:53.271 --> 01:05:53.711]  Some U.S.
[01:05:53.751 --> 01:05:59.393]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:06:00.093 --> 01:06:03.576]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:06:03.596 --> 01:06:06.698]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[01:06:29.975 --> 01:06:36.643]  GCN listeners, now you can transform your living room's HDTV into a virtual war room command center with ZV.

[01:07:34.768 --> 01:07:37.029]  His number one word of use is change.
[01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:40.650]  What if the change was not the change America expected?
[01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:45.811]  What if all natural products were handed over to the pharmaceutical companies to be eradicated?
[01:07:46.011 --> 01:07:50.333]  What if the only remedy for sickness and disease was to take drugs?
[01:07:50.593 --> 01:07:51.613]  This hasn't happened yet.
[01:07:51.613 --> 01:07:51.753]  Not yet.
[01:07:52.053 --> 01:07:53.514]  I repeat, not yet.

[01:08:46.024 --> 01:08:50.848]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:50.968 --> 01:08:55.151]  I asked David Eicher earlier to plug some of his books and videos, and he said, nope, I'm not going to plug them.
[01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:56.052]  I don't care about that.
[01:08:58.273 --> 01:09:01.716]  It's an amazing individual, but he does have a great bunch of videos, very enlightening.
[01:09:02.176 --> 01:09:04.978]  He'll make a lot of people laugh, and you need to get him at DavidIke.com.
[01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:06.940]  And I've gotten to that point, too.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.021]  That's why I say my videos are all free on the internet.
[01:09:09.362 --> 01:09:12.284]  They're in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv, or get them and make copies.
[01:09:12.804 --> 01:09:18.228]  But at the same time, you need to support people like David Ike and myself, because then we can have more people, do more, take more action.
[01:09:18.528 --> 01:09:21.030]  I'm running more of a news organization, so my needs are greater.
[01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:24.913]  So that keeps me back on the, you know, straight and narrow of just trying to fund this operation.
[01:09:26.454 --> 01:09:33.096]  Now, he's just traveling around the world, speaking to huge crowds of people and writing books and making videos every year, and we just really appreciate him.
[01:09:33.456 --> 01:09:39.558]  David, I was asking you the question for the InfoWars Internet audience, now we're back on the main audience, about the mapmakers of the mind.
[01:09:40.558 --> 01:09:44.579]  It's also dangerous if we unlock minds.
[01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:48.161]  Or people unlock their own minds by us pointing out that they're locked.
[01:09:48.541 --> 01:10:05.311]  And then the New World Order has set up lots of spiritual traps, or lots of, you wouldn't even call it spiritual coding traps is what I would call them, of false rabbit trails, which are meant to suck people into very dangerous cults, very dangerous Eastern organizations, all sorts of New World Order stuff.
[01:10:05.331 --> 01:10:14.877]  Because the New World Order knows this, they're into it, so they've made it all very dark, and they capture people that break up through the control matrix, and they're swimming up,
[01:10:15.198 --> 01:10:17.027]  And the New World Order captures them in...
[01:10:20.474 --> 01:10:21.215]  I'm on TV right now.
[01:10:21.235 --> 01:10:31.542]  I'm showing people, you know, here's the mass-controlled consciousness that believes the Federal Reserve is federal, and the government loves you, and everything's fine, and melamine plastic's good for your kidneys, and poison's good for you.
[01:10:31.562 --> 01:10:48.293]  You know, they're down here, but more and more are breaking through, swimming up, so the New World Order's created lots of false solutions, and lots of, I mean, it's very sophisticated, and then they infest the, you know, consciousness crowd, and knowing that people are going to escape, they're there to capture them.
[01:10:48.573 --> 01:10:49.974]  How do people protect themselves from that?
[01:10:51.535 --> 01:10:54.858]  Well, this is the bottom line of what they're doing, Alex.
[01:10:56.299 --> 01:11:00.223]  You can call it soul, I call it infinite consciousness, expanded consciousness, whatever you like.
[01:11:00.843 --> 01:11:12.493]  The idea is to keep that from imposing or infusing its level of wisdom and awareness and love and the understanding that everything is one.
[01:11:13.033 --> 01:11:13.514]  We're good to go.
[01:11:29.071 --> 01:11:44.956]  Yeah, the thing is that once you disconnect from, if you like, higher levels of awareness and you become encased in body consciousness, you're looking outside of yourself for information to get a fix on life, yourself, the nature of reality, and what comes back
[01:11:45.316 --> 01:11:50.619]  What you learn at school, what you learn through the media, what you learn from bankers and politicians and all the rest of it.
[01:11:50.659 --> 01:12:00.604]  In other words, what they're doing is isolating the computer from our consciousness, what you would call soul, and then programming the computer with the reality that suits the agenda.
[01:12:01.024 --> 01:12:10.049]  Now, as people awaken, there are, what I've called in my books, endless cul-de-sacs, which are being set up, little mouse traps.
[01:12:10.589 --> 01:12:10.869]  I think so.
[01:12:10.889 --> 01:12:11.169]  I think so.
[01:12:37.078 --> 01:12:45.644]  New Age guy or whatever just as the religions in all their forms are about the people Handing their power and their belief systems over to others.
[01:12:46.165 --> 01:12:47.205]  We are consciousness.
[01:12:47.225 --> 01:13:01.015]  We are infinite consciousness We're all expressions of the same consciousness That's why the fighting between it is so idiotic and stupid and ridiculous But that's what happens when you lose that understanding of unity and you see everything in in a partners because you're caught in the in the body
[01:13:01.015 --> 01:13:04.116]  Yeah, back into myself, and that's the incredible thing, is that
[01:13:26.866 --> 01:13:35.833]  Just in a meat and potatoes way, let's say there is no consciousness about this, which we know is a lie, but through genetic consciousness, it's all a mirror.
[01:13:35.853 --> 01:13:48.844]  I understand that I am all those that came before me, and I am passing on through my children, everybody that came before me and who I was, and I realize I'm going to love my children's grandchildren, who I'll never meet, or their great-grandchildren,
[01:13:49.404 --> 01:13:57.231]  As much as I love my children, or I love myself, in fact, more so, and so why would I want to commit a crime against the genetic code?
[01:13:57.592 --> 01:14:09.863]  Why would I want to commit a crime against humanity when I'm related to all these people, whether they be black or white, Chinese or German, and I realize that, and then I ask myself, how, why does the New World Order revel
[01:14:10.203 --> 01:14:12.404]  They know the Mercury is damaging the genetic code.
[01:14:12.664 --> 01:14:15.765]  They know the GMO is attacking and actually mutating the human species.
[01:14:16.105 --> 01:14:17.525]  They know they're attacking the Earth.
[01:14:17.925 --> 01:14:21.727]  And then they give us fake environmentalism when we rebel against that and then use it to control us more.
[01:14:22.067 --> 01:14:23.987]  They know they are killing things.
[01:14:24.767 --> 01:14:27.668]  Now we've talked about the positive side, the enemy.
[01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:32.990]  They understand this system, but the controllers, the shadow behind the throne,
[01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:40.373]  The power behind the throne, they have made the conscious decision to revel in darkness and destruction.
[01:14:40.713 --> 01:14:41.173]  Why?
[01:14:41.874 --> 01:14:46.336]  Well, let's just go one point, which kind of relates to this, but relates to what you just said.
[01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:51.378]  Take consciousness to be the most brilliant computer programmer in the world.
[01:14:52.330 --> 01:15:04.194]  And he's sitting at his desk in front of a computer, symbolic of the body, shall we say, and he's trying to get his genius through that computer into the reality on the screen, this world.
[01:15:04.998 --> 01:15:22.271]  If that computer is destabilized, if it's not working, if it's got viruses, if it's not decoding properly, if it's got various things wrong with it, if it's electrically imbalanced and its decoding system is distorted, I don't care if that guy in that chair
[01:15:23.067 --> 01:15:28.052]  Symbolic of our true self, our true consciousness is the best computer programmers ever lived.
[01:15:28.292 --> 01:15:30.594]  He's not going to pass that genius through that computer.
[01:15:30.914 --> 01:15:45.708]  So this conspiracy, Alex, is about attacking the vehicle, the decoding system, to make sure that it is inefficient and imbalanced and doesn't operate to the true efficiency and magnitude that it possibly
[01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:46.048]  We could.
[01:15:46.148 --> 01:15:47.069]  I've got to add something.
[01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:48.630]  It's so incredible what you're saying.
[01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:50.752]  That's the true reason for the microchip, Alex.
[01:15:51.132 --> 01:15:59.939]  In a computer, the central processing unit, the CPU, that filters all the information traffic, is a microchip.
[01:16:00.679 --> 01:16:06.824]  The reason they're talking now about having human computing... It's an electrochemical computer.
[01:16:07.385 --> 01:16:07.565]  Yeah.
[01:16:08.085 --> 01:16:15.371]  Because they're talking now about connecting the human brain to a computer, and you can work the computer through your thoughts, is because they're
[01:16:15.811 --> 01:16:16.472]  Thank you very much.
[01:16:35.545 --> 01:16:36.826]  No, I was just going to agree with you.
[01:16:55.177 --> 01:17:24.205]  That's why, when you study eugenics, publicly they say it's about making the race better and getting rid of the bad, but real eugenics, at the PhD level, they say, no, we've got to mutate and dumb down the mass of people, so we in the future, and this is a hundred years ago, you know, all the top eugenicists, and we put it in the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, all the proof, there's a bibliography of it, whatistheendgame.com, they say, we really want to wreck humanity, so we can greedily control it for ourselves, because they'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.
[01:17:25.646 --> 01:17:26.046]  Exactly.
[01:17:26.126 --> 01:17:33.551]  And so, when you look at the body computer on one level, it is an electro-chemical organism.
[01:17:33.992 --> 01:17:37.234]  What are they bombarding us, not least our kids, with?
[01:17:38.395 --> 01:17:42.378]  Chemical cocktails called soft drinks and food.
[01:17:43.398 --> 01:17:49.843]  Electromagnetic microwave attacks and pollution which we're living in.
[01:17:49.863 --> 01:17:52.345]  And if you want to affect every fish,
[01:17:52.905 --> 01:17:53.486]  We're good to go.
[01:18:13.824 --> 01:18:18.406]  Let me throw a point out.
[01:18:18.426 --> 01:18:21.427]  Let me throw a point out.
[01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:26.609]  When you go out to southern Utah and Monument Valley, and there's nobody around, you can be in your tent.
[01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:28.130]  It's not just the beautiful vistas that...
[01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:34.192]  You know, raise the soul, as people say, or, you know, make the soul sore.
[01:18:34.692 --> 01:18:39.855]  It is that you are not around all the electrochemical pollution.
[01:18:40.495 --> 01:18:43.716]  You are outside of that, and you're also outside the pollution.
[01:18:43.736 --> 01:18:44.416]  And they've proven this.
[01:18:44.456 --> 01:18:46.317]  There's, like, wavelengths coming off the mind.
[01:18:46.357 --> 01:18:47.177]  They broadcast.
[01:18:47.858 --> 01:18:52.500]  All the programmed brains that are broadcasting the evil, you're also away from those.
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:55.761]  And it's the incredible peace of being out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:18:57.032 --> 01:19:01.018]  Yep, you know the computer talks, consciousness knows.
[01:19:01.619 --> 01:19:08.768]  That's why when you go into the silence and you quieten your mind, you can get incredible insights that you can't when the mind chatter is going.
[01:19:08.788 --> 01:19:11.312]  Because the computer mind chatter never really stops.
[01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:13.335]  Everyone listening to this show will understand what I mean.
[01:19:13.755 --> 01:19:14.135]  I don't know.
[01:19:41.662 --> 01:19:49.889]  Yeah, there was a line in that which encapsulates what we're saying here.
[01:19:49.929 --> 01:19:53.371]  It said, keep them busy, busy, busy back on the farm with their other animals.
[01:19:53.391 --> 01:19:56.654]  They're trying to keep our mines occupied constantly.
[01:19:57.114 --> 01:19:57.534]  I think so.
[01:20:16.561 --> 01:20:19.963]  Okay, David, I want to ask you advice about myself personally.
[01:20:19.983 --> 01:20:22.004]  I really respect you in this area.
[01:20:22.424 --> 01:20:27.726]  In the behind-the-scenes, internet-only discussion at PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars exclusive streams right now.
[01:20:27.746 --> 01:20:28.867]  For everybody else, we'll be right back.
[01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:33.734]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[01:20:34.214 --> 01:20:36.537]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[01:20:37.138 --> 01:20:40.983]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[01:20:41.423 --> 01:20:46.389]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:49.694]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special
[01:20:49.974 --> 01:20:50.414]  We're good to go.

[01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:31.599]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.442]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:21:35.502 --> 01:21:37.324]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:21:37.804 --> 01:21:40.686]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:21:40.987 --> 01:21:46.451]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:21:46.731 --> 01:21:50.654]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:21:50.974 --> 01:21:55.876]  In the Infowar, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:33.090]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.591]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[01:22:35.891 --> 01:22:36.292]  I think so.
[01:22:50.828 --> 01:22:51.168]  We're good to go.

[01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.731]  No!
[01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:39.612]  I can't find my keys!

[01:23:57.363 --> 01:23:59.465]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus?

[01:24:31.323 --> 01:24:31.663]  All right.
[01:24:32.825 --> 01:24:34.347]  The time's almost up with David Icke.
[01:24:34.547 --> 01:24:37.772]  I might be able to twist his arm for 10 minutes more into overdrive today, but I doubt it.
[01:24:38.794 --> 01:24:40.356]  There's so much he wants to talk about.
[01:24:40.376 --> 01:24:45.884]  I want to know about why the elite, who are aware of all of this, like to get into the darkness.
[01:24:46.365 --> 01:24:48.506]  And why they revel in that and some of the rituals they do.
[01:24:48.866 --> 01:24:54.248]  I mean now Macy's has come out with 666 Knights of Hell Bohemian Grove wear.
[01:24:54.308 --> 01:24:55.708]  It says Bohemian Grove on it.
[01:24:56.188 --> 01:24:58.289]  It's using official Bohemian Grove logos.
[01:24:58.689 --> 01:24:59.770]  Macy's nationwide.
[01:24:59.830 --> 01:25:01.890]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:25:01.971 --> 01:25:06.552]  I want to get into that and then anything else you want to cover, David, and then take a few phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:25:09.153 --> 01:25:15.158]  But everything you say makes all these other ideas and thoughts I've already had, but at a deeper level, start exploding.
[01:25:15.178 --> 01:25:16.319]  So that's why I'm jumping in.
[01:25:16.539 --> 01:25:18.441]  But I want you to have a chance to really run.
[01:25:18.701 --> 01:25:22.284]  So I'm just going to literally turn my mic off and step back.
[01:25:22.304 --> 01:25:24.726]  We're going to skip this next break for the internet.
[01:25:24.966 --> 01:25:26.087]  Everybody else will be right back.
[01:25:26.828 --> 01:25:27.968]  And just, you've got the floor.
[01:25:28.029 --> 01:25:28.449]  Run with it.
[01:25:29.898 --> 01:25:37.724]  Well, first of all, in terms of where we're going with this, we need to get a blank sheet of paper.
[01:25:38.385 --> 01:25:45.410]  I'm not talking as some guru who's on a mountain and telling you how to do it.
[01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:49.093]  I'm telling you what's happened to me over the last 20 years.
[01:25:50.134 --> 01:25:59.421]  It's a simple thing, Alex, but my goodness me is it powerful in how it pans out and plays out and changes in your life and everything.
[01:26:00.261 --> 01:26:25.775]  Once you look in the mirror and you identify what you are looking at with the vehicle that's allowing you to experience this frequency range we call the world, and you move your sense of identity to, I am infinite consciousness, I am all that is, has been and ever will be, not that time exists outside of this reality, it's another figment of our manipulated imagination.
[01:26:26.415 --> 01:26:26.856]  I don't
[01:26:42.273 --> 01:26:42.934]  I don't know.
[01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:03.371]  That's attraction.
[01:27:03.391 --> 01:27:13.380]  I was in a half-wake state waking up the other day, and going around my head was this statement, Love is not what you are in.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.541]  I'm in love with you.
[01:27:14.921 --> 01:27:16.203]  Love is what you are.
[01:27:16.303 --> 01:27:24.009]  And at that level, that level of love, the true definition of love, not attraction, but love for all, love for self, it has
[01:27:25.422 --> 01:27:27.323]  No, I don't think so.
[01:27:44.054 --> 01:27:45.474]  Freedom doesn't do consequences.
[01:27:45.514 --> 01:27:46.695]  Love doesn't do consequences.
[01:27:46.775 --> 01:27:48.215]  It does what it believes to be right.
[01:27:48.615 --> 01:28:09.601]  And I tell you what, when you get to this level of consciousness, Alex, something that would change this world overnight because of all that would come from it, if people started making decisions not based on what is right for me in the circumstances before me, and that turns out often not to be right for you anyway, but what is right
[01:28:10.561 --> 01:28:13.302]  End of story in the circumstances that I face.
[01:28:13.782 --> 01:28:14.622]  What is right?
[01:28:14.862 --> 01:28:15.682]  What is just?
[01:28:16.002 --> 01:28:16.922]  What is fair?
[01:28:18.063 --> 01:28:21.483]  What do I need to do to pursue that version of what is right?
[01:28:21.783 --> 01:28:29.525]  And if we did that, there'd be no hunger, there'd be no conflict, there'd be no child abuse, there'd be no environmental abuse, there'd be none of this stuff.
[01:28:29.725 --> 01:28:37.787]  We'd be in a completely different level of consciousness, and therefore we'd be in a completely different level of experiences of this world.
[01:28:38.127 --> 01:28:39.407]  As Albert Einstein said,
[01:28:39.867 --> 01:28:44.931]  You cannot solve problems with the same level of consciousness that created them.
[01:28:45.352 --> 01:29:00.124]  And because we've got caught in body consciousness and not the high soul consciousness, if you like, that we really are, therefore we bring a political party in with a certain level of consciousness and we replace it with another with the same level of consciousness.
[01:29:00.484 --> 01:29:08.991]  We interact with the world with the same level of consciousness and then we wonder why the world never changes for the better because the same level of consciousness
[01:29:09.671 --> 01:29:09.892]  Thank you.
[01:29:24.788 --> 01:29:29.792]  Because illusions only control you when you think they're real, and that's the key to this conspiracy.
[01:29:30.092 --> 01:29:37.757]  It's been persuading people that this illusion that we're interacting with, and we can have great fun and joy with, is actually real.
[01:29:37.897 --> 01:29:44.661]  And once you buy that one, you're in body consciousness, and you're in the slammer.
[01:29:45.122 --> 01:29:51.886]  And we're at a time now with this awakening when we can open the door and transform this world.
[01:29:57.488 --> 01:30:01.470]  David, I don't want to turn this into a massive extravaganza.
[01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:04.331]  No, I tell you, you want to go into the dark stuff, I'll tell you about that.
[01:30:04.511 --> 01:30:14.374]  Well, well, well, the thing is, well, I mean, I know that you've got a lot of things to do, but I would love, and I promise you we would end it then and also give you a break later.
[01:30:14.835 --> 01:30:17.255]  What if we did 20 minutes into the next hour?
[01:30:18.176 --> 01:30:19.176]  The show normally ends in 30.
[01:30:20.136 --> 01:30:21.037]  We're on the march.
[01:30:21.537 --> 01:30:23.138]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:24.058 --> 01:30:26.739]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:30.735 --> 01:30:42.462]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, Ready Reserve foods in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration and to help you and your family survive the global economic crash.
[01:30:43.062 --> 01:30:45.604]  Ready Reserve is offering the pre-inauguration special.
[01:30:46.204 --> 01:30:52.968]  Between now and January 20th, 2009, all food units U1 through U7 are being offered at wholesale prices.
[01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:54.989]  That's a 33% savings.
[01:30:55.289 --> 01:30:58.591]  A year's supply of meals starts as low as 73 cents per meal.
[01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:08.216]  Ready Reserve Food offers only the highest quality dehydrated food, packed in double enameled cans in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, allowing a 15 plus year shelf life.
[01:31:08.916 --> 01:31:09.196]  I think so.
[01:31:29.731 --> 01:31:36.134]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:31:36.495 --> 01:31:38.476]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:31:39.136 --> 01:31:40.176]  But who is the enemy?
[01:31:40.677 --> 01:31:41.237]  Bin Laden.
[01:31:41.477 --> 01:31:42.418]  This is his ammo.
[01:31:42.438 --> 01:31:43.838]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:31:43.858 --> 01:31:45.299]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:52.586]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:31:52.986 --> 01:31:53.447]  Some U.S.
[01:31:53.487 --> 01:31:59.212]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:31:59.833 --> 01:32:03.276]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:32:03.516 --> 01:32:13.580]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:14.561]  Fabled enemies.
[01:32:15.021 --> 01:32:22.304]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:32:22.784 --> 01:32:26.186]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:32:29.935 --> 01:32:31.797]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:32:31.957 --> 01:32:38.643]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:32:38.903 --> 01:32:47.070]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:32:47.291 --> 01:32:53.016]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:32:53.436 --> 01:32:54.977]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:57.178]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:32:57.278 --> 01:32:59.679]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look.
[01:32:59.739 --> 01:33:01.580]  And I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:33:01.741 --> 01:33:03.842]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:33:03.962 --> 01:33:11.726]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:33:29.896 --> 01:33:35.760]  I think I'm going to go ahead and myself, David can't stay with us, but I'm going to go into overdrive at InfoWars.com for 20 minutes.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:37.802]  You good to do that, Paul?
[01:33:38.262 --> 01:33:41.625]  Because I want to cover what's happening with the markets after David leaves us.
[01:33:42.886 --> 01:33:45.828]  But I do want to take some time out and take some calls before the show ends as well.
[01:33:47.443 --> 01:33:58.848]  David, during the break, when we were still talking for the internet audience on PrisonPlanet.tv, we were discussing, you know, I was saying, well, the elite are like a cancer, though.
[01:33:58.888 --> 01:33:59.788]  They understand this.
[01:33:59.828 --> 01:34:06.932]  They've decided to be dark and evil and to shudder the souls of humanity because it makes them more easily manageable.
[01:34:08.232 --> 01:34:10.613]  Well, they are locked into such a depth of their own body consciousness that
[01:34:34.466 --> 01:34:43.671]  That's why, and there's other connections to that, but they're so locked into that level of reality that that's why they're so good at manipulating it.
[01:34:44.391 --> 01:34:58.318]  They're almost like soulless beings who have lost such contact with these higher levels of awareness that basically, if you look at the way they operate, they operate through intellect.
[01:34:58.838 --> 01:35:00.459]  They are very, very clever.
[01:35:00.899 --> 01:35:06.101]  But they have absolutely no wisdom, and cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on earth.
[01:35:06.561 --> 01:35:14.483]  So they're coming from an intellectual level, which is a body consciousness level, because the intellect thinks and works things out.
[01:35:14.563 --> 01:35:17.044]  It's not that high a knowing that we've talked about.
[01:35:17.424 --> 01:35:25.787]  And they're so stuck in it that they have lost touch with a key self-balancing mechanism, which is empathy.
[01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:27.829]  They have no empathy.
[01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:34.117]  And because they have no empathy, they have no emotional consequences for what they do to people.
[01:35:34.157 --> 01:35:39.464]  So 3,000 people on 9-11, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dead and maimed civilians in Iraq.
[01:35:40.146 --> 01:35:43.289]  We couldn't do that because we have empathy.
[01:35:43.569 --> 01:35:48.373]  We have this emotional feeling for the consequences for others of our actions.
[01:35:48.674 --> 01:35:50.756]  When you don't have them, there are no limits.
[01:35:50.816 --> 01:35:52.177]  And that's why they act like they do.
[01:35:52.217 --> 01:36:02.046]  And it's why I've been saying for years, if you see what they would do on the basis of what you would do, then you've lost the plot because they're not the same because of what I've been talking about.
[01:36:02.466 --> 01:36:03.007]  And they are.
[01:36:03.067 --> 01:36:04.388]  I mean, I know I've had lots of
[01:36:05.294 --> 01:36:05.915]  I don't know.
[01:36:18.121 --> 01:36:31.311]  Just outside of visible light, you know, as I said right at the start of this chat today, I'm sitting here in California and all the television and radio stations broadcasting in California are sharing the same space that I'm sharing.
[01:36:31.351 --> 01:36:36.215]  They're not on top of each other like a chest of drawers, they're sharing the same space because they're vibrating at different speeds.
[01:36:36.675 --> 01:36:40.038]  Now when you get two stations that are very close to each other,
[01:36:40.965 --> 01:37:01.091]  There's close enough interference, interference symbolic of interaction, and these entities that these people worship in their stupid, sick and horrific rituals are to interact with these entities that operate just outside of visible light, just outside of human sight.
[01:37:01.571 --> 01:37:11.618]  And what these entities do is they feed off low vibrational human energy, which is fear, stress, all these different expressions of low vibrational energy.
[01:37:12.038 --> 01:37:18.242]  And this, Alex, is where the age-old term of sacrificing young virgins to the gods comes from.
[01:37:18.602 --> 01:37:21.884]  What are young virgins symbolic of in that term?
[01:37:22.285 --> 01:37:23.966]  Prepubescent children.
[01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:29.950]  I've understood this by talking to people who've taken part in these things overwhelmingly against their will.
[01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:31.090]  I don't know.
[01:37:50.742 --> 01:37:51.102]  Thank you.
[01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:04.631]  I think so.
[01:38:25.177 --> 01:38:35.820]  They do these rituals and so a mass creation of this energy, a mass version of this ritual, we call wars.
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:46.123]  We call credit crunches and banking collapses because of all the stress and fear energy that is released by the people in the face of these things.
[01:38:46.163 --> 01:38:50.684]  So on one level, it's not the only reason they do it, but on one level they're manipulating
[01:38:52.865 --> 01:38:59.947]  So it's not just that they're evil and enjoy it, it is a psychic war and they're polluting everything with gloom and doom.
[01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:17.114]  Yeah, they're bringing every... See, as I said earlier, they are massively locked into low, low, low vibrational consciousness.
[01:39:17.434 --> 01:39:22.477]  There is almost no light there at all, and that's why they act like they do.
[01:39:22.497 --> 01:39:24.038]  You know, we've had this age-old
[01:39:26.619 --> 01:39:27.000]  I think?
[01:39:43.521 --> 01:39:49.146]  Well, I've talked to top psychologists who study the serial killers, and they describe it as if they're dead.
[01:39:49.587 --> 01:39:53.570]  They have no emotion, nothing in life, but there's like a burning light.
[01:39:53.930 --> 01:40:02.598]  They only feel alive while they're torturing a child, while they're doing something particularly horrible, and so they become total slaves to it.
[01:40:02.998 --> 01:40:05.279]  Yeah, and they're also slaves to something else.
[01:40:05.319 --> 01:40:06.640]  They're slaves to these entities.
[01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.922]  Now, this is another important thing to start connecting some dots here.
[01:40:11.423 --> 01:40:21.848]  Why is this human elite obsessed with interbreeding, with each other, and not interbreeding outside of itself?
[01:40:21.968 --> 01:40:26.951]  Because if you really break it down to the level that we're talking about today, Alex,
[01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:31.013]  Well, the Egyptians said they were gods, and they had to keep that bloodline in the family.
[01:40:31.473 --> 01:40:34.094]  Yeah, but what's the obsession with bloodline?
[01:40:34.114 --> 01:40:34.654]  It is this.
[01:40:34.734 --> 01:40:35.495]  Keeping the money together.
[01:40:36.215 --> 01:40:49.160]  When you procreate, you are in effect downloading two hard drives, called DNA and whatever, onto one hard drive, which we call the new child body computer.
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:50.301]  The child is consciousness.
[01:40:50.341 --> 01:40:52.542]  The child's body is a computer like everyone else.
[01:40:53.229 --> 01:41:12.942]  Now, that means that these bloodlines, when they interbreed, what they're holding is, in effect, a software program, a certain vibrational field, which is the fusion of the two aspects of the same genetic line, i.e., the same, you know, aristocracy or royal family, whatever.
[01:41:13.403 --> 01:41:15.704]  Now, this means... Hello?
[01:41:15.964 --> 01:41:16.885]  No, no, sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:16.965 --> 01:41:19.107]  Yeah, this means that the...
[01:41:21.983 --> 01:41:42.590]  The Elite Bloodlines in physical form within this reality, they are vibrating to a particular frequency which, because it's a hybrid, has a vibrational sympathy with these entities operating just outside of visible light, human sight, and therefore that
[01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:44.311]  I don't know.
[01:42:00.826 --> 01:42:02.427]  They can with the rest of the population.
[01:42:02.748 --> 01:42:04.109]  And so this is the key, Alex.
[01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:13.539]  You've got a human bloodline, which is a hybrid bloodline with a certain type of DNA which they interbreed incessantly and have over the centuries to hold.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:21.408]  This allows a vibrational connection with these entities which allows the possession of these human forms by these non-human entities.
[01:42:22.309 --> 01:42:23.010]  I think so.
[01:42:36.297 --> 01:42:37.098]  We're good to go.
[01:42:59.841 --> 01:43:09.729]  This is how they've done it, and this is what these bloodlines are about, having vibrational compatibility with these entities which they worship, these gods that they worship.
[01:43:11.630 --> 01:43:13.431]  Well, and I know the elite believes that.
[01:43:13.811 --> 01:43:16.152]  When I was at Bohemian Grove, people would say, oh, it's just a play.
[01:43:16.612 --> 01:43:19.493]  I was there with a thousand-plus members watching the ritual.
[01:43:19.533 --> 01:43:20.654]  They were grinding their teeth.
[01:43:21.074 --> 01:43:23.175]  They were in religious rapture.
[01:43:23.235 --> 01:43:30.798]  They did some other ritual over behind the trees that was the real ritual, and they did the mock human sacrifice of the child, and that's in their own literature.
[01:43:31.218 --> 01:43:39.262]  Now Macy's has come out with all of this Bohemian Grove, the Knights of the Illuminati, 666, you know, the
[01:43:40.442 --> 01:43:42.205]  Uh, you know, the hell group.
[01:43:42.625 --> 01:43:45.049]  I mean, now they're really throwing it in our face.
[01:43:45.349 --> 01:43:50.417]  And we always know that through the popular fashions, they telegraph what's coming in the future.
[01:43:50.717 --> 01:43:53.842]  Why are we seeing all the skulls and death and now Illuminati clothing?
[01:43:55.110 --> 01:44:04.098]  Yeah, because they understand, because they are so entrapped in computer-level reality, they understand this stadium.
[01:44:04.899 --> 01:44:11.105]  And so what they're doing is trying to pull all the time, as we talked about in this chat today,
[01:44:11.405 --> 01:44:16.750]  They're trying to pull humanity into a sense of reality that operates in the same stadium.
[01:44:16.770 --> 01:44:19.692]  And that's what the Roman Colosseums were all about, the blood and death.
[01:44:19.993 --> 01:44:21.854]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:44:22.275 --> 01:44:31.363]  They are absolutely terrified of this awakening, which they knew was coming, and they know is now here.
[01:44:31.603 --> 01:44:37.348]  They're terrified of it, and they're desperately pushing this agenda forward, not least the microchip.
[01:44:37.748 --> 01:44:38.349]  I think so.
[01:44:56.519 --> 01:44:56.739]  Thank you.
[01:45:13.988 --> 01:45:22.632]  It's because we all vibrate, although we vibrate within a certain frequency range, we all vibrate on our own unique signal as well.
[01:45:22.993 --> 01:45:29.676]  And if you know someone's DNA through the technology they have, they can work out that unique signal and target it.
[01:45:29.736 --> 01:45:34.719]  It's what the whole conspiracy comes down to in the end, and everything else is playing it out.
[01:45:35.059 --> 01:45:39.861]  Well, we knew from the Army plan that was written up in the 80s and classified in 2000,
[01:45:42.372 --> 01:45:56.105]  In February, we know in there that the Army says that through FADS, through security, through prisoners, through Alzheimer's patients, and through having law enforcement be forced to take chips, they could then force the public to do it.
[01:45:56.125 --> 01:45:58.307]  And now if you want to be a fighter pilot, you're going to have to have it.
[01:45:58.647 --> 01:46:00.209]  That's openly mainstream news.
[01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:07.993]  They are preparing the public that if you want to have a job, you're going to have to have basically this little wire port into your brain.
[01:46:08.013 --> 01:46:29.663]  And the Army says that by 2025, all of us will be, this is what they say, and this is where the movie The Matrix came from, was from the DARPA, exactly, from the DARPA reports, and this is in my book, Descent into Tyranny, they say that they're going to put us all in tanks to be in the hive mind, so that movie is the plan.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:43.111]  Well, the Hype Mind is something I've been writing about for a long, long time, and you can only put people... Because, you know, when I talk about, you know, infinite consciousness, I'm not talking about everyone being a clone and acting the same.
[01:46:43.471 --> 01:46:46.233]  Infinite consciousness is infinite possibilities.
[01:46:46.253 --> 01:46:50.557]  Yeah, tie it into the bigger picture, not into the narrow band.
[01:46:50.978 --> 01:46:52.399]  But, David, my point is...
[01:46:52.679 --> 01:47:04.673]  You're not just saying this, the official army prospectus says this is the plan for full spectrum dominance because there'll be no more war, we'll all be safe if we're in these tanks.
[01:47:05.133 --> 01:47:11.620]  You can't make stuff up that's weirder than last year, the British ten year prospectus talked about having a neutron bomb.
[01:47:12.902 --> 01:47:17.106]  Us, if we resist them, having to kill masses of us, flash mobs.
[01:47:17.447 --> 01:47:21.390]  I mean, people think David Icke is weird or off the charts.
[01:47:21.771 --> 01:47:28.878]  If you read what DARPA and the Pentagon and their head futurist, Mr. Marshall, are saying, it's all even stranger than David Icke.
[01:47:29.258 --> 01:47:49.164]  Oh yeah, I mean, you know, the rabbit hole goes much deeper than any of us have got yet, but the thing is, Alex, as you were saying, and I was pointing out, the infinite consciousness is all possibility, so expressing your uniqueness, your maverick, your unique spin on life is actually expressing the infinite consciousness.
[01:47:49.384 --> 01:47:53.168]  That changes the controlled paradigm, so we're taking it over cell by cell.
[01:47:53.529 --> 01:47:53.969]  Exactly.
[01:47:54.009 --> 01:48:03.300]  So, when you talk, as you just have about those documents, you know, the tanks and everyone becoming a hive mind, they can only create a hive, and they can't get to consciousness.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.761]  You see, it's vibrating too quickly.
[01:48:04.781 --> 01:48:05.963]  It's too powerful for them anyway.
[01:48:06.383 --> 01:48:07.805]  It's a massive revolution.
[01:48:26.604 --> 01:48:37.067]  People should not, for a second, underestimate the incredible, extraordinarily amazing magnitude of what's going on.
[01:48:37.147 --> 01:48:48.031]  Yes, we need to know what the manipulation and the conspiracy is doing, so we streetwise do it, and there are enormous numbers of people who still don't realize they're slaves, who need that information to realize that they are, then they can do something about it.
[01:48:48.131 --> 01:48:49.151]  David, we've got to go to calls.
[01:48:49.191 --> 01:48:49.971]  We've got to go to calls.
[01:48:50.371 --> 01:48:52.672]  Ladies and gentlemen, the bottom line is this.
[01:48:52.832 --> 01:48:56.032]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, DavidIke.com.
[01:48:56.632 --> 01:48:58.853]  Check it out and then put it into action.
[01:48:58.873 --> 01:49:00.913]  It doesn't mean you'll be a master of this overnight.
[01:49:01.173 --> 01:49:11.535]  Just start questioning the system, stop watching TV, love your family, eat healthy, go out and warn people, expose the bankers, and that leads you on the path to expanding your horizons.
[01:49:11.595 --> 01:49:12.995]  David Ike, what an amazing individual.
[01:49:13.015 --> 01:49:13.815]  David, let's take calls.
[01:49:13.835 --> 01:49:16.436]  We're going to skip this next break as well for the Internet listeners.
[01:49:17.436 --> 01:49:18.877]  In Texas, you're on the air.
[01:49:18.917 --> 01:49:19.377]  Go ahead.
[01:49:20.218 --> 01:49:21.758]  Is this me?
[01:49:22.219 --> 01:49:22.639]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:22.839 --> 01:49:23.679]  Okay, Michael, yeah.
[01:49:23.979 --> 01:49:25.020]  Hey, thanks, man.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:27.381]  You both express yourself so eloquently.
[01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:29.382]  I've been wanting to talk with both of y'all for a while.
[01:49:30.143 --> 01:49:36.326]  And, you know, talking about the dynamics of these vibrational frequencies, you've covered it pretty good.
[01:49:37.826 --> 01:49:46.671]  What I think we have coming toward us, those that are truth-rising, such as the both of you and your listening audience, is that we're approaching a point of separation.
[01:49:47.592 --> 01:49:48.953]  In our vibration frequencies.
[01:49:49.473 --> 01:49:55.717]  They've kept by keeping us in fear, they've brought us down to their low life vibration that you've expressed so eloquently.
[01:49:56.477 --> 01:50:14.567]  And by us raising our vibration frequency by getting above their fear that they're trying to perpetrate us and keep us beat down, we will be able to raise our vibration frequency to a point that they won't be able to exist because they are so low life and dishonest and
[01:50:15.327 --> 01:50:22.030]  You know, they create the killing field, they've contaminated the planet, you know, the food, the water, everything, you know, and they operate with no conscience.
[01:50:22.890 --> 01:50:30.573]  And I just feel like we're approaching that point of separation where they won't be able to function in their thought forms in a higher vibration.
[01:50:30.613 --> 01:50:31.913]  In fact, that's what they call it.
[01:50:31.953 --> 01:50:38.416]  They call it separation consciousness and the people they torture to create mind control slaves, and that's declassified, David.
[01:50:39.256 --> 01:50:49.586]  Yeah, I went through years and years in the 90s and early in this century, deeply, deeply researching mind control techniques.
[01:50:50.247 --> 01:50:56.352]  And when I talk to a stream of mind control victims that we're now trying to deprogram, they'll tell me the same.
[01:50:56.733 --> 01:50:57.894]  They can't get to consciousness.
[01:50:58.334 --> 01:50:58.755]  Hold on, hold on.
[01:50:58.775 --> 01:50:59.655]  Here we go, behind the scenes.
[01:50:59.675 --> 01:51:00.096]  David, continue.
[01:51:00.116 --> 01:51:02.078]  David, continue, and then Michael in Texas, finish up.
[01:51:02.118 --> 01:51:02.398]  Go ahead.
[01:51:21.889 --> 01:51:32.953]  Okay, what I was going to say is that if you look at society, and the way it's structured, and all the things that are in society... Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health.
[01:51:33.194 --> 01:51:38.436]  They're in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use, and the objects we touch.
[01:51:38.736 --> 01:51:40.536]  Exposure is impossible to avoid.
[01:51:40.757 --> 01:51:44.618]  Heavy metals build up within the body over a period of time, causing poor health.
[01:51:44.878 --> 01:51:49.300]  However, with Kilorex, they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:50.041]  I think so.
[01:52:09.582 --> 01:52:13.245]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero, and we knew what to do.
[01:52:38.171 --> 01:52:39.234]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:52:39.474 --> 01:52:45.850]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:52:46.531 --> 01:52:55.053]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:52:55.413 --> 01:53:02.215]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[01:53:02.515 --> 01:53:05.556]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:53:05.576 --> 01:53:11.357]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:53:11.457 --> 01:53:14.018]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[01:53:14.538 --> 01:53:20.407]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[01:53:20.447 --> 01:53:23.071]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[01:53:23.512 --> 01:53:28.419]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[01:53:29.861 --> 01:53:38.971]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[01:53:39.131 --> 01:53:47.180]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:50.744]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[01:53:52.145 --> 01:53:54.506]  Continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis?
[01:53:54.646 --> 01:54:05.948]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol naturally and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage once a day.
[01:54:06.188 --> 01:54:12.390]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Freshwater Organics.
[01:54:12.630 --> 01:54:20.392]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an excellent source of natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[01:54:20.552 --> 01:54:21.712]  Order some today at Freshwater.
[01:54:22.412 --> 01:54:33.640]  Real, it's a digital image and she isn't really personally looking at you.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:36.202]  They're manipulating our basic genetic code.
[01:54:36.582 --> 01:54:38.523]  As a mammal, you're saying rise above that.
[01:54:38.583 --> 01:54:40.605]  David Icke, and then finish up, Michael.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:48.507]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the five senses are there, and we can enjoy them, and we experience this world through them.
[01:54:48.887 --> 01:54:58.637]  But once the five senses become the only, or the master level, of experiences... We can be lied to and manipulated through that!
[01:54:59.017 --> 01:55:02.040]  Yeah, I mean, we are then in the trap.
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:04.122]  We're then in the mousetrap.
[01:55:04.162 --> 01:55:04.683]  They've got us.
[01:55:05.443 --> 01:55:08.565]  So, you can experience the five senses, something very nice.
[01:55:08.605 --> 01:55:10.766]  We don't come here to then ignore the fact that we're here.
[01:55:10.786 --> 01:55:21.450]  I would say this to people who awaken, quote, spiritually, you know, we don't come here to awaken our consciousness and then ignore the fact that we're actually here because we've opened our consciousness.
[01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:28.573]  Consciousness has to express itself to make the changes in society.
[01:55:28.693 --> 01:55:30.074]  Faith without works is dead!
[01:55:30.614 --> 01:55:36.078]  I mean, if you really change your consciousness from evil and destruction to love and light, you're going to try to help people.
[01:55:36.359 --> 01:55:37.479]  Quickly finish, Michael.
[01:55:37.499 --> 01:55:40.542]  Over time, you're going to try to do what is right.
[01:55:40.582 --> 01:55:42.643]  Not even try, you're going to do what is right.
[01:55:42.943 --> 01:55:46.906]  If you're not doing that, then don't kid yourself, you've got expanded consciousness.
[01:55:46.946 --> 01:55:47.847]  Michael, anything else?
[01:55:48.227 --> 01:55:48.608]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:49.288 --> 01:55:58.475]  Just for you to listen to the audience, one way through my own personal experience of raising my personal vibration and recognizing it as it happens is the feeling of goosebumps.
[01:55:58.915 --> 01:55:59.616]  I think so, yes.
[01:56:20.652 --> 01:56:22.334]  Whatever that guy's name is.
[01:56:22.434 --> 01:56:24.296]  Getting past the fear, taking action.
[01:56:24.336 --> 01:56:24.936]  Absolutely.
[01:56:24.956 --> 01:56:25.958]  That gets you.
[01:56:26.038 --> 01:56:26.458]  Exactly.
[01:56:26.478 --> 01:56:27.879]  People think that I'm putting out fear.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:28.320]  I'm not.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:29.721]  I'm saying there's a threat.
[01:56:30.002 --> 01:56:30.802]  We've got to meet it.
[01:56:30.883 --> 01:56:33.065]  It's empowering to take action against it.
[01:56:33.085 --> 01:56:33.866]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:33.886 --> 01:56:35.387]  David, I know you've got to go have that meeting.
[01:56:35.427 --> 01:56:42.094]  I'm going to twist your arm for only five minutes when the hour ends in three minutes so we can talk to Ashur, Ryan, Tim and Guy.
[01:56:42.314 --> 01:56:43.876]  You can do five minutes after, can't you?
[01:56:44.176 --> 01:56:45.176]  Okay, okay, no problem.
[01:56:45.196 --> 01:57:01.440]  Alright, twisting the arm of David Icke, DavidIcke.com, and when this radio show ends on the AM and FM dial in three minutes, you'll have to tune to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com on those streams or PrisonPlanet.tv to see us go live into overdrive right now.
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:04.941]  Uh, Ashore in Oklahoma, you're on the air with David Icke.
[01:57:06.642 --> 01:57:06.882]  Hello?
[01:57:07.082 --> 01:57:07.942]  Yes, sir, you're on the air.
[01:57:08.482 --> 01:57:12.123]  Yes, um, Mr. Jones, I've been listening to you for about three years now.
[01:57:14.033 --> 01:57:19.197]  I have quite an extensive notebook of notes that I've been keeping relative to many of your shows.
[01:57:20.298 --> 01:57:28.065]  This one in particular struck my interest because you're speaking of vibrational energy, which you've been referring to as frequencies.
[01:57:28.806 --> 01:57:34.811]  I've been studying that phenomenon for some time now, mainly through ancient languages.
[01:57:35.988 --> 01:57:53.152]  And, uh, for example, I am of the belief, based on extensive research, that what you refer to as the New World Order and the current economic crisis is actually a transformation of the Beast of Mammon that will re-emerge as the Neo-Roman Empire.
[01:57:53.712 --> 01:58:04.415]  And one of the reasons I say that is because of the calendar that Western culture and most of the industrialized world lives by is the same calendar that was implemented by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C.
[01:58:06.172 --> 01:58:12.858]  And that what we are experiencing now is, in fact, the culmination of the prophecy relative to... Alright, stop right there.
[01:58:12.878 --> 01:58:13.379]  I've got to jump.
[01:58:13.399 --> 01:58:15.000]  We're ending the main transmission.
[01:58:15.040 --> 01:58:16.301]  Only five minutes left with David Icke.
[01:58:16.321 --> 01:58:17.222]  DavidIcke.com.
[01:58:17.522 --> 01:58:20.345]  Again, my websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:20.565 --> 01:58:27.972]  When David leaves us in five minutes, I'm going to cover the latest economic developments in overdrive only at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:28.412 --> 01:58:31.215]  But in the 30 seconds we've got left, the main transmission, David,
[01:58:33.096 --> 01:58:37.099]  That we have to end this in just a few minutes, because other shows are coming up, and I've got to get off the line.
[01:58:39.641 --> 01:58:50.530]  Well, we're just going to go into retransmission now, but bottom line, David, they are trying to recreate empires they've had previously, and I'll ask you right now, as we go into overdrive, why they are doing that.
[01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:54.253]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, into overdrive, right now.
[01:58:56.312 --> 01:59:02.635]  David, I'm going to let you go in just five minutes because I've got to get off this network line, but network, I'm fine to be here for five minutes, I know that.
[01:59:02.836 --> 01:59:04.076]  Comment on what he was just saying.
[01:59:05.017 --> 01:59:09.599]  Well, they definitely throw this forward a very, very long way.
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:12.881]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:59:12.921 --> 01:59:15.862]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:59:20.302 --> 01:59:26.688]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[01:59:27.068 --> 01:59:29.030]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[01:59:29.710 --> 01:59:30.771]  But who is the enemy?
[01:59:31.252 --> 01:59:31.792]  Bin Laden.
[01:59:32.053 --> 01:59:32.873]  This is his MO.
[01:59:32.913 --> 01:59:34.415]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[01:59:34.435 --> 01:59:35.876]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[01:59:36.396 --> 01:59:43.143]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[01:59:43.563 --> 01:59:44.004]  Some U.S.
[01:59:44.044 --> 01:59:49.789]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:53.853]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:56.936]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists!
[02:00:22.663 --> 02:00:24.604]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:25.064 --> 02:00:28.045]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:32.366 --> 02:00:35.628]  Aaron's got some final points he wants to make on
[02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:47.151]  This is what governs the world.
[02:00:47.191 --> 02:00:48.411]  This is the reality.
[02:00:48.451 --> 02:00:49.651]  This is what we're dealing with.
[02:00:50.251 --> 02:00:51.432]  We are being soft-killed.
[02:00:51.452 --> 02:01:00.514]  We're being studied, poisoned, tested, mixtures of poisons, how to dumb us down, how to psychologically control us, how to kill us, how to get us out of the way.
[02:01:00.554 --> 02:01:06.696]  Before I go back to Aaron and then Mark Stepnowski, new vitality, aloes, colon cleanse.
[02:01:15.856 --> 02:01:27.059]  Before I go back to Aaron, I just want everybody to check out Aloe's Colon and Body Cleanse.
[02:01:27.079 --> 02:01:28.139]  They are just great folks.
[02:01:28.159 --> 02:01:32.060]  Their phone number is 1-800-569-4056.
[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:32.940]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:38.081]  Or you can simply go to NewVitality.com.
[02:01:38.101 --> 02:01:41.282]  They have hundreds of great products, but that's just one of them that detoxifies and
[02:01:41.622 --> 02:01:42.203]  We're good to go.
[02:02:06.408 --> 02:02:06.728]  1-800-569-4856 1-800-569-4056 NOW!
[02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:15.911]  That is a Acola Blue.
[02:02:15.931 --> 02:02:19.053]  An Acola Blue is acolablue.com.
[02:02:19.073 --> 02:02:21.595]  They are an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[02:02:22.055 --> 02:02:24.577]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[02:02:24.917 --> 02:02:26.878]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[02:02:26.938 --> 02:02:29.180]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:31.962]  Machine produces up to 28 liters or 7.5 gallons a day.
[02:02:31.982 --> 02:02:37.806]  This is a pretty amazing system, folks, when you realize that
[02:02:38.866 --> 02:02:44.894]  You can grab it right out of the air, and it has no fluoride, none of the stuff they self-medicate you or forcibly medicate you with.
[02:02:45.375 --> 02:02:52.445]  Ecoloblue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E-D-O-T-C-O-M, big banner up on InfoWars.com, or 866-585-4044.
[02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:54.507]  By the way, they sold out of these and just got more in.
[02:02:54.547 --> 02:02:55.569]  We sold the company out.
[02:02:55.669 --> 02:02:56.290]  You did, the listeners.
[02:02:56.510 --> 02:03:00.893]  866-585-4044 or 1-866-585-4044 at coloblue.com.
[02:03:00.973 --> 02:03:05.156]  Okay, Aaron, you've got about 2-3 minutes left.
[02:03:05.456 --> 02:03:06.777]  I want to go back to Aaron now.
[02:03:07.138 --> 02:03:09.119]  Aaron, finish up with your other points on eugenics.
[02:03:09.419 --> 02:03:13.262]  I was going to rapid-fire a Margaret Singer quote and then finally a Richard Dawkins quote.
[02:03:14.003 --> 02:03:18.466]  Margaret Singer, the most merciful thing a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.
[02:03:18.946 --> 02:03:21.789]  Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.
[02:03:22.309 --> 02:03:24.572]  Eugenics sterilization is an urgent need.
[02:03:24.632 --> 02:03:27.755]  We must prevent multiplication of this bad stock.
[02:03:28.155 --> 02:03:33.841]  Eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to solution of racial, political, and social problems.
[02:03:34.341 --> 02:03:39.384]  And Richard Dawkins has this kind of open thought of, uh, what if eugenics came back?
[02:03:39.864 --> 02:03:47.568]  In the 1920s and 1930s, scientists from both the political left and right would not have found the idea of designer babies particularly dangerous.
[02:03:47.968 --> 02:03:50.109]  Though, of course, they would not have used that phrase.
[02:03:50.209 --> 02:03:58.093]  Today, I suspect that the idea is too dangerous for comfortable discussion, and my conjecture is that Adolf Hitler is responsible for the change.
[02:03:58.593 --> 02:04:02.616]  Nobody wants to be caught agreeing with that monster, even in a single particular.
[02:04:02.916 --> 02:04:10.301]  The specter of Hitler has led some scientists to stray from ought to is and deny that breeding for human qualities is even possible.
[02:04:10.641 --> 02:04:18.706]  But if you can breed cattle for milk, horses for speed, dogs for skill, why shouldn't you breed humans for mathematical, musical, or athletic ability?
[02:04:19.147 --> 02:04:21.288]  I wonder some 60 years after Hitler's death,
[02:04:22.046 --> 02:04:27.511]  Why we might at least venture to ask what the moral difference is between breeding for musical ability.
[02:04:27.671 --> 02:04:32.316]  And the problem is with breeding, you're talking about exterminating most of the puppies or kittens that are born.
[02:04:32.576 --> 02:04:34.838]  You're talking about the state having this incredible control.
[02:04:35.258 --> 02:04:45.528]  And in special breed, you get more mental illness, more inherited diseases, and the elites that are bred, most of their children are born retarded or had serious mental illness problems.
[02:04:45.768 --> 02:04:47.730]  But do they give up this system of control?
[02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:52.374]  No, they've only intensified it down throughout the last hundred plus years.
[02:04:53.415 --> 02:04:58.980]  And now they're practicing their eugenics upon us through the vaccines, through the chemtrails, through the entire system.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:08.188]  Aaron, I want to have you back up in a couple weeks again for a whole other discussion and other areas of eugenics because this is the governing system, the ideology of the New World Order.
[02:05:08.208 --> 02:05:10.110]  We've got a special guest coming up after the break.
[02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:15.616]  A lot of key videos and things from what happened in Denver with the MSNBC staff attacking.
[02:05:15.636 --> 02:05:16.998]  This is going up on YouTube later.
[02:05:17.318 --> 02:05:19.000]  That'll be up on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:19.281 --> 02:05:21.824]  The Rage Against the Machine concert being attacked by police.
[02:05:22.124 --> 02:05:23.906]  That's going up on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:24.206 --> 02:05:26.269]  And fabled enemies being censored by Google.
[02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:28.572]  That is now up on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:28.612 --> 02:05:29.072]  Stay with us.
[02:05:30.419 --> 02:05:36.301]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[02:05:36.661 --> 02:05:50.405]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke, pet odors, you name it.
[02:05:50.625 --> 02:05:52.286]  What else can three oxygen atoms?
[02:05:52.466 --> 02:05:53.847]  In other words, ozone do?
[02:05:54.148 --> 02:05:58.672]  Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[02:05:58.932 --> 02:06:00.814]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[02:06:01.034 --> 02:06:04.277]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[02:06:04.577 --> 02:06:11.183]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[02:06:11.403 --> 02:06:18.348]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or ionic zone ozone generators by going to ioniczone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[02:06:18.408 --> 02:06:20.269]  That's I-O-N-I-C, zone, dot com, or toll free, 800-549-9535, ionic zone.
[02:06:20.289 --> 02:06:21.310]  It is a big idea.
[02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:22.150]  A new world order.
[02:06:22.251 --> 02:06:25.273]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful force.
[02:06:40.543 --> 02:06:47.928]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:06:48.688 --> 02:06:56.012]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:06:59.021 --> 02:07:04.024]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:07:04.484 --> 02:07:08.307]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:07:08.347 --> 02:07:10.868]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[02:07:10.928 --> 02:07:12.049]  Most people have no idea.
[02:07:12.089 --> 02:07:12.829]  They're not after money.
[02:07:12.849 --> 02:07:13.970]  They have all the money they need.
[02:07:14.150 --> 02:07:14.910]  They're after power.
[02:07:15.131 --> 02:07:16.011]  That's their after news here.
[02:07:16.271 --> 02:07:20.834]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:07:21.014 --> 02:07:24.456]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:24.576 --> 02:07:25.697]  In Game.
[02:07:25.757 --> 02:07:27.318]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[02:07:28.158 --> 02:07:28.899]  I'm good.
[02:07:47.176 --> 02:07:47.576]  I think so.
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:09.820]  We're good to go.
[02:08:36.025 --> 02:08:43.851]  Well, we've got one of the most famous linemen in NFL history, Mark Stepnowski, on with us.
[02:08:43.871 --> 02:08:45.472]  Pro career in the NFL.
[02:09:01.971 --> 02:09:02.652]  I don't know.
[02:09:09.173 --> 02:09:11.074]  And he is a 9-11 truther.
[02:09:11.094 --> 02:09:13.355]  We had him on almost a year ago.
[02:09:13.375 --> 02:09:14.536]  It was a long time ago.
[02:09:14.816 --> 02:09:15.937]  Time just flies by.
[02:09:15.957 --> 02:09:16.937]  It seems like yesterday.
[02:09:18.178 --> 02:09:22.941]  And he also campaigns for the legalization of marijuana, the decriminalization.
[02:09:23.381 --> 02:09:25.982]  You got 80 plus percent of drug users only use marijuana.
[02:09:26.382 --> 02:09:32.866]  They need to keep it that way so that they need to keep it illegal so they can SWAT team raid more people and fill more prisons.
[02:09:33.306 --> 02:09:38.088]  Well, the government has been caught hundreds of times shipping in heroin and cocaine and laundering the money.
[02:09:38.348 --> 02:09:42.110]  Did you know it's legal for foreign drug money to be invested in the New York Stock Exchange?
[02:09:42.490 --> 02:09:49.753]  And the former head, Richard Grasso, when he was head of the New York Stock Exchange, was in Reuters going to the FARC, communist guerrillas, and saying, invest your cocaine money with us.
[02:09:50.273 --> 02:09:53.855]  I'm going off on a rant here about the decriminalization of marijuana.
[02:09:54.195 --> 02:10:00.457]  They need to keep it illegal because, what is it, 86-87% of people only smoke marijuana that uses illegal drugs.
[02:10:00.937 --> 02:10:02.178]  George Washington smoked it.
[02:10:03.471 --> 02:10:05.712]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excuse.
[02:10:05.992 --> 02:10:06.792]  What's a greater crime?
[02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:09.352]  Guys in black masks SWAT teaming you at 3 a.m.?
[02:10:10.053 --> 02:10:11.473]  Or somebody smoking marijuana?
[02:10:11.933 --> 02:10:15.554]  You know, do we want this great evil in the name of stopping this minor evil?
[02:10:16.334 --> 02:10:17.674]  And I'm not a marijuana person.
[02:10:17.974 --> 02:10:21.375]  I've smoked marijuana, and it's just not my cup of tea.
[02:10:21.815 --> 02:10:26.436]  But I know a lot of people that do smoke it, a lot of doctors and lawyers and people, and they don't need to be SWAT teamed.
[02:10:26.816 --> 02:10:29.817]  Mark Stepnowski, I really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:32.681]  Thanks Alex, it's good to be on with you today.
[02:11:01.481 --> 02:11:10.370]  Yeah, I think it's great to see, you know, like you said, as time goes on, more and more people are coming forward as they gradually become aware of the facts.
[02:11:11.631 --> 02:11:21.120]  Obviously, you know, through online research and through the amount of books and magazines that have come out now, you know, enough authors have come forward and stated their opinion.
[02:11:21.441 --> 02:11:23.403]  And I think what's really important now is
[02:11:24.542 --> 02:11:33.308]  You know, obviously, people early on, shortly after the 9-11 attacks, were kind of pigeonholed as conspiracy theorists.
[02:11:33.808 --> 02:11:40.012]  But now, that label, it never did apply, but it's less applicable now than ever.
[02:11:40.732 --> 02:11:47.354]  Simply because the people who are coming out in favor of 9-11 Truth are too credible to ignore.
[02:11:47.374 --> 02:12:00.579]  You know, in the last few years we've had the formation of things like Scholars for 9-11 Truth, which includes architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, pilots for 9-11 Truth.
[02:12:00.999 --> 02:12:09.982]  We have former people who worked in government, including the current administration, who are coming out and saying that they don't believe the official story.
[02:12:10.911 --> 02:12:25.019]  So it's just a case of, you know, as more people become exposed to it, as the media blackouts and mainstream media continues, mostly via the internet, people are becoming connected and becoming aware of these facts and voicing their opinion.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:28.121]  It's very encouraging to see.
[02:12:28.141 --> 02:12:36.986]  You know, it's never too late for anybody who feels strongly about this issue to come forward and voice their opinion, because I think
[02:12:38.328 --> 02:12:58.002]  As time goes on, people will be surprised to find out that if they are no longer worried about expressing their skepticism of the official story regarding 9-11, they will find out that there are a lot of people out there, you might refer to them as a silent majority, who also feel very much the same way.
[02:12:58.562 --> 02:13:07.387]  They are either too afraid or too reluctant to come forward and also express their doubts in the official story.
[02:13:07.607 --> 02:13:08.908]  What made you go public?
[02:13:08.948 --> 02:13:15.492]  I mean, you were one of the first prominent sports figures to go public.
[02:13:15.672 --> 02:13:18.153]  I mean, now Willie Nelson's gone public.
[02:13:18.834 --> 02:13:20.655]  Jesse Ventura's gone public.
[02:13:21.195 --> 02:13:23.316]  I mean, it's just exponential.
[02:13:23.376 --> 02:13:25.958]  But what made you decide to take that leap?
[02:13:27.643 --> 02:13:36.745]  I just, you know, I got tired of waiting for the channels of government to move along in a proper fashion.
[02:13:36.765 --> 02:13:49.828]  You know, like a lot of people, I had hope, it turns out to be false hope, in retrospect, but I had hope at the time that maybe the 9-11 Commission would be legitimate.
[02:13:52.688 --> 02:13:56.289]  You know, the safeguards are in place in constitutional government.
[02:13:56.369 --> 02:14:01.131]  I thought that they would kick in and operate in the manner in which they're supposed to.
[02:14:01.151 --> 02:14:08.053]  And we would see a proper investigation, you know, with relevant witnesses and
[02:14:09.594 --> 02:14:10.975]  Evidence.
[02:14:10.995 --> 02:14:14.778]  And, as we all know, none of that really came to fruition.
[02:14:14.798 --> 02:14:17.700]  The 9-11 Commission was a sham.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:18.740]  It was a cover-up.
[02:14:18.841 --> 02:14:28.507]  It was a modern-day version of the Warren Commission as far as its attempt to silence witnesses and suppress truth-tellers.
[02:14:29.368 --> 02:14:37.894]  And, you know, when things reached that point and that commission was shown to be the impotent vehicle that it was,
[02:14:38.886 --> 02:14:45.609]  I just felt compelled to, in my own small way, say whatever I could as far as what I thought the truth was.
[02:14:45.809 --> 02:14:48.430]  Well, Mark, that isn't in your own small way.
[02:14:49.190 --> 02:14:53.272]  It's not just that you're a celebrity or a well-known sports figure.
[02:14:53.752 --> 02:15:02.595]  It's that people resonate with the courage of a Willie Nelson or a Mark Stepnowski or a former German defense minister or a former governor.
[02:15:02.916 --> 02:15:03.836]  They resonate
[02:15:04.582 --> 02:15:07.043]  And they know that person has a lot to lose.
[02:15:07.063 --> 02:15:08.464]  That person's going to be demonized.
[02:15:08.484 --> 02:15:10.525]  This person is really stepping up.
[02:15:10.966 --> 02:15:15.188]  And so that's what makes you and so many others that have stood up and gone public heroes.
[02:15:15.248 --> 02:15:16.449]  But look at the vindication.
[02:15:17.129 --> 02:15:18.210]  The Chicago Tribune
[02:15:18.863 --> 02:15:24.985]  Four months ago, reported as well as Associated Press, the NSA declassified that Israel did attack the U.S.'
[02:15:24.965 --> 02:15:30.806]  's liberty to try to sink it, to blame it on Egypt to start World War III, as they've now tried, the U.S.
[02:15:30.846 --> 02:15:31.766]  has tried in Georgia.
[02:15:32.866 --> 02:15:39.448]  It's now come out, Sy Hersh at a big media event, and he did admit in New Yorker Magazine that Cheney, he just said a staged provocation.
[02:15:39.508 --> 02:15:42.289]  He said, this is the provocation to have U.S.
[02:15:43.755 --> 02:15:48.899]  Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians on blue PT boats attack U.S.
[02:15:48.959 --> 02:15:50.420]  ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[02:15:51.381 --> 02:16:01.127]  So, government-sponsored terror, the fact the Gulf of Tonkin was staged, that's all coming out now, and people say, well, that was seven years ago, you know, 9-11, why are you so concerned?
[02:16:01.468 --> 02:16:11.755]  Well, because Black Ops is going to continue to stage terror attacks as a pretext for control if we don't step up and expose that they're behind it.
[02:16:12.055 --> 02:16:13.156]  Mark your comments on that.
[02:16:14.344 --> 02:16:15.645]  Yeah, I entirely agree.
[02:16:16.846 --> 02:16:18.648]  It's been a steady progression.
[02:16:18.708 --> 02:16:21.731]  It's been just one instant after another.
[02:16:21.791 --> 02:16:28.777]  We saw last year where Bush and Tony Blair had the plan to send U.S.
[02:16:28.817 --> 02:16:32.200]  military planes over Iran disguised as U.N.
[02:16:32.260 --> 02:16:32.721]  planes.
[02:16:33.402 --> 02:16:34.002]  We're good.
[02:16:53.214 --> 02:16:57.698]  Putting together a false flag terror op to stimulate war with Iran.
[02:16:58.018 --> 02:17:03.342]  This is a guy who is now Barack Obama's main foreign policy advisor.
[02:17:03.943 --> 02:17:15.372]  So again, we have these people coming out in mainstream media within the last year with these scenarios that have come and gone that have involved false flag terror.
[02:17:16.357 --> 02:17:21.700]  So I just think in this day and age, people are becoming a little bit too hip to what's going on.
[02:17:21.780 --> 02:17:23.681]  They understand ahead of time.
[02:17:23.722 --> 02:17:28.564]  Similar to what happened in Spain when you had the false flag terror attack there with the trains.
[02:17:28.604 --> 02:17:32.207]  The people within days came out in the hundreds of thousands and said, we know you did it.
[02:17:32.227 --> 02:17:34.388]  And it turned out it was the intelligence operation.
[02:17:35.108 --> 02:17:35.769]  Exactly.
[02:17:35.789 --> 02:17:38.991]  Hopefully we are reaching that point now in North America.
[02:17:39.031 --> 02:17:42.073]  If you call a critical mass or whatever you want to.
[02:17:43.388 --> 02:17:52.601]  Hopefully through, you know, the work that you do and statements made by 9-11 truthers like myself and the many others around the world.
[02:17:52.621 --> 02:17:59.590]  You know, we have people, a politician in Japanese parliament came out wanting to have another investigation.
[02:18:00.852 --> 02:18:11.770]  We're having a march in Canada to Ottawa to culminate on September 11th where they're going to present a petition at Parliament Hill for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada.
[02:18:14.255 --> 02:18:24.202]  So I think, you know, worldwide you are seeing people come around and, you know, waking up to the fact that this was a false flag operation, you know, to have a certain effect on the American public.
[02:18:24.242 --> 02:18:39.874]  The question now is, you know, are the people who live in America going to be smart enough to look into the right sources of information to kind of emancipate themselves from this media blackout that's going on?
[02:18:40.614 --> 02:18:42.936]  I think if people, you know, continue to
[02:18:43.934 --> 02:19:00.661]  Turn off their TVs, give less credence to mainstream media, corporate media, and instead, you know, read online, read books, read magazines, anything out there that's going to give the true story of 9-11 truth.
[02:19:02.282 --> 02:19:09.145]  This is what's going to mobilize the population in America so that when another false flag terrorist attack occurs,
[02:19:10.285 --> 02:19:22.819]  Whatever it is, whether it's bioterror, whether it's a mini-nuke somewhere, people will see it for what it is and not be railroaded into a certain mindset like they were after 9-11.
[02:19:29.872 --> 02:19:45.622]  He's a pro bowler and he's, again, going public, not because it's fun, but because it's his duty, and I would venture to say because he just said it, he knows that if we don't expose the tool of false flag, that mechanism, this military-industrial complex is going to keep doing it to hurt us.
[02:19:46.182 --> 02:19:48.264]  Just like in England, how they hunt pheasants.
[02:19:48.624 --> 02:19:55.228]  They beat pots and pans, they have beaters who push the birds out on a wedge so the hunters can shoot them when they get driven out.
[02:19:55.709 --> 02:19:56.409]  It's the same thing.
[02:19:56.449 --> 02:19:59.291]  You want to attack Iran, you want to attack Iraq, you stage an event.
[02:19:59.831 --> 02:20:00.812]  You want to attack Egypt?
[02:20:00.832 --> 02:20:01.653]  You stage an event.
[02:20:01.953 --> 02:20:08.037]  They've been caught over and over and they're going to continue to do this if we don't expose it.
[02:20:08.578 --> 02:20:19.546]  And that's why the courage of now thousands of prominent people that have gone public for 9-11 truth and now all these architects and engineers and businesses is unstoppable.
[02:20:19.566 --> 02:20:25.731]  We're going to come back and talk about the fraudulent new NIST report with Mark Stepnowski and then we're going to take your phone calls.
[02:20:26.051 --> 02:20:26.511]  Stay with us.

[02:20:29.901 --> 02:20:33.482]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefits?
[02:20:33.742 --> 02:20:40.965]  The problem is today's supplements contain things like DL-alpha-tocopherol, a synthetic form of vitamin E derived from petroleum.
[02:20:41.225 --> 02:20:45.707]  Or ferrous fumarate, an inorganic form of iron that can actually damage your body.
[02:20:45.827 --> 02:20:50.268]  Most of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.

[02:21:30.024 --> 02:21:36.428]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:21:36.789 --> 02:21:38.450]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:21:39.430 --> 02:21:40.452]  But who is the enemy?
[02:21:40.972 --> 02:21:41.513]  Bin Laden.
[02:21:41.773 --> 02:21:42.454]  This is his M.O.s.
[02:21:42.614 --> 02:21:44.136]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:21:44.156 --> 02:21:45.818]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[02:21:46.138 --> 02:21:52.885]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[02:21:53.286 --> 02:21:53.746]  Some U.S.
[02:21:53.766 --> 02:21:59.413]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:22:00.113 --> 02:22:03.614]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:22:03.994 --> 02:22:13.856]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:22:14.076 --> 02:22:14.836]  Fabled enemies.

[02:22:29.947 --> 02:22:32.129]  Imagine feeling totally helpless.
[02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:38.413]  Imagine thinking and hearing clearly, but unable to move as the ground rises to meet you.
[02:22:38.673 --> 02:22:48.059]  Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is invaded, locked, and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in taser technology.
[02:22:48.259 --> 02:22:55.824]  If this sounds scary, imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend, loved one, or even yourself.

[02:23:30.146 --> 02:23:32.068]  How much food do you have in your fridge?
[02:23:32.408 --> 02:23:35.291]  How long would it last in the event of a nationwide crisis?

[02:24:44.565 --> 02:24:47.289]  Two-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys.
[02:24:47.329 --> 02:24:48.251]  Also played with the Oilers.
[02:24:48.271 --> 02:24:49.453]  Five-time Pro Bowler.
[02:24:49.633 --> 02:24:51.756]  Mark Stepnoski on the line.
[02:24:51.776 --> 02:24:54.881]  I remember sitting around watching the Cowboys play him.
[02:24:55.806 --> 02:24:56.686]  Rooting for Mark.
[02:24:57.306 --> 02:25:00.667]  Now I'm rooting for him in a much more important way, and that is his courage.
[02:25:01.187 --> 02:25:07.568]  Speaking out for 9-11 Truth, there's a ballot initiative in New York to get a new investigation going, or expose that, a grand jury.
[02:25:07.588 --> 02:25:09.309]  There's a lot of different initiatives.
[02:25:09.769 --> 02:25:14.310]  There's marches going on, events coming up in New York next week that I hope folks go to.
[02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:21.171]  Let's talk about that ballot initiative first, and then I want to get into the NIST report, Mark.
[02:25:22.347 --> 02:25:30.924]  Yeah, obviously, since we're coming up on the anniversary of 9-11, there's a lot of activities going around to highlight the fact that the official story is untrue.
[02:25:32.873 --> 02:25:33.894]  It is in New York City.
[02:25:33.934 --> 02:25:36.376]  It's a 9-11 ballot initiative.
[02:25:36.656 --> 02:25:45.162]  This is a way for, I mean, it's obvious that, like I said earlier, that we're not going to get a proper investigation through government channels.
[02:25:45.282 --> 02:25:55.629]  But this is a way for the people of New York City to create a new 9-11 commission, an investigation of the events, which would have subpoena power.
[02:25:55.669 --> 02:25:57.390]  It would have some legal authority.
[02:25:59.361 --> 02:26:02.842]  Volunteers in New York City have been going around getting signatures on petitions.
[02:26:03.223 --> 02:26:06.804]  They needed a minimum of $30,000, which they just recently achieved.
[02:26:07.204 --> 02:26:08.405]  So that was great news.
[02:26:08.725 --> 02:26:14.747]  And now these petitions will be submitted to the New York City Clerk and New York City Council.
[02:26:17.618 --> 02:26:29.232]  With a sufficient amount of signatures, this being above 30,000, they will be able to present this, and then it can become an issue, a topic, on the ballot.
[02:26:29.272 --> 02:26:37.061]  I believe it would be part of the 2009 ballot for mayor, the election of mayor in New York City.
[02:26:37.739 --> 02:26:52.953]  Where citizens can vote for themselves, they can make their voices heard that they think it is necessary as citizens of that city, as voters of New York City, to demand a new investigation, one that actually has some teeth.
[02:26:55.135 --> 02:26:55.855]  Absolutely.
[02:26:57.498 --> 02:26:58.539]  It shouldn't just be New York.
[02:26:58.559 --> 02:27:07.026]  We need lots of grand jury-type public investigations, both governmental and non-governmental, to draw this out publicly and continue to expose it.
[02:27:07.106 --> 02:27:16.034]  Everything is a step, to use a football analogy, for more yards to get a new set of downs towards the touchdown, bringing these criminals to justice.
[02:27:16.694 --> 02:27:19.957]  And even if we never bring them to justice by sending them to prison,
[02:27:20.715 --> 02:27:31.002]  By publicly convicting them in the court of public opinion, and by educating the public about false flag terrorism, it breaks that tool that the black ops continue to use.
[02:27:31.082 --> 02:27:31.982]  Mark, your take on that?
[02:27:33.363 --> 02:27:34.584]  Yeah, without a doubt.
[02:27:34.704 --> 02:27:37.666]  It's all a question of, you know, just mobilizing the masses.
[02:27:37.746 --> 02:27:42.569]  I think a lot of people fall into a defeatist attitude of, you know, what can I do?
[02:27:42.589 --> 02:27:44.310]  How can I make a difference?
[02:27:44.390 --> 02:27:45.471]  I'm only one person.
[02:27:46.576 --> 02:27:55.965]  Well, just by signing that petition, just by signing your name on that piece of paper, you are, in effect, saying, look, I don't believe in what the government is telling me.
[02:27:55.985 --> 02:27:59.829]  I don't believe the lies that I'm being told in corporate media.
[02:27:59.989 --> 02:28:02.852]  You know, I demand a new investigation.
[02:28:02.872 --> 02:28:06.696]  This is one way for people to have their voice heard, people who otherwise
[02:28:07.376 --> 02:28:08.396]  Might feel powerless.
[02:28:09.357 --> 02:28:11.017]  There's a lot of people in New York City.
[02:28:11.257 --> 02:28:15.718]  If a lot of them mobilize, it might be surprising what could actually happen.
[02:28:15.898 --> 02:28:24.220]  But, you know, I urge listeners of your show who either live in New York City or have family or friends there to let them know about this.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:35.343]  They can look it up on www.nyc911initiative.org and find out anything they would like to about this movement.
[02:28:35.523 --> 02:28:36.463]  But I think that
[02:28:37.535 --> 02:28:43.462]  You know, right now it's moving along very nicely, and should it succeed in any degree, it'll be a big step forward.
[02:28:43.502 --> 02:28:44.904]  It really could be a brand, bro.
[02:28:45.104 --> 02:28:49.890]  And a lot of people have this loser mentality of, oh, it'll never be corruption, oh, there's no point.
[02:28:50.350 --> 02:28:52.353]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have a choice, number one.
[02:28:52.373 --> 02:28:54.115]  Number two, we're actually having an effect.
[02:28:54.615 --> 02:28:57.656]  The majority of Americans in major polls believe there's a 9-11 cover-up.
[02:28:57.676 --> 02:28:58.736]  There's hundreds of these polls.
[02:28:59.176 --> 02:29:00.456]  We're having an effect.
[02:29:00.476 --> 02:29:08.018]  Look how far we've come from myself, two months before the attack, saying I think they're going to attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[02:29:08.118 --> 02:29:10.958]  Because I saw them preparing the public, introducing bin Laden.
[02:29:10.998 --> 02:29:12.039]  I knew their past history.
[02:29:12.359 --> 02:29:19.040]  I knew the FBI had cooked the bomb, framed the driver, given them the detonators, blocked local police in 93 with the first attack.
[02:29:20.060 --> 02:29:23.001]  I mean, again, look how far we've come from 9-11 that first day.
[02:29:23.521 --> 02:29:30.963]  Look how far we've come, thanks to people like Mark Sipnosky, Willie Nelson, Governor Ventura, Stephen Jones.
[02:29:31.803 --> 02:29:34.743]  Now, I'm going to skip this break for InfoWars.com.
[02:29:35.224 --> 02:29:36.164]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[02:29:36.284 --> 02:29:41.825]  I don't want to waste any time that we've got with Mark Sipnosky today, but Mark, that NIST report,
[02:29:42.617 --> 02:29:43.880]  They delayed it three years.
[02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:48.450]  The people on the government NISH board are involved in explosive thermite research.
[02:29:48.470 --> 02:29:49.211]  They're experts.
[02:29:49.552 --> 02:29:51.156]  They're involved in government contracts.
[02:29:51.637 --> 02:29:52.719]  And then they had to
[02:29:54.049 --> 02:29:54.850]  Uh, pull back.
[02:29:55.090 --> 02:30:01.073]  They had to, uh, say, okay, our last five reasons for the towers falling and Building 7 falling are wrong.
[02:30:01.514 --> 02:30:02.754]  It's not fuel oil tank.
[02:30:02.814 --> 02:30:04.695]  It's not bad building construction.
[02:30:05.056 --> 02:30:06.056]  It's not fires.
[02:30:06.136 --> 02:30:07.697]  It's not... No, no.
[02:30:08.077 --> 02:30:12.280]  They gave a new reason, a new syndrome, a new phenomenon.
[02:30:12.540 --> 02:30:14.982]  We're going to cover that right now with Mark Stavnoski.
[02:30:15.002 --> 02:30:15.482]  Stay with us.
[02:30:20.521 --> 02:30:23.508]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:30:24.451 --> 02:30:27.117]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:31.288 --> 02:30:33.449]  Holidays are right around the corner.
[02:30:33.489 --> 02:30:40.731]  The crowds, the countless hours in traffic, finding a parking spot just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.
[02:30:41.011 --> 02:30:45.772]  How about surprising your loved ones with a gift they can use every day of the year?

[02:31:36.175 --> 02:31:37.536]  That's an inside job!
[02:31:37.596 --> 02:31:38.716]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[02:31:38.736 --> 02:31:40.357]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[02:31:40.457 --> 02:31:42.638]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[02:31:42.698 --> 02:31:48.340]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, or you and me?
[02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:49.041]  Sit down.
[02:31:49.081 --> 02:31:49.621]  Shut up.
[02:31:49.641 --> 02:31:56.604]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[02:31:56.624 --> 02:32:01.346]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[02:32:09.384 --> 02:32:12.785]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[02:32:12.945 --> 02:32:15.066]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[02:32:15.106 --> 02:32:22.107]  And if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.
[02:32:22.127 --> 02:32:24.728]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now.

[02:32:27.268 --> 02:32:29.749]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[02:32:30.835 --> 02:32:32.977]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[02:32:33.497 --> 02:32:38.081]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[02:32:38.542 --> 02:32:40.423]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[02:32:40.483 --> 02:32:41.684]  We are under the microscope.
[02:32:41.804 --> 02:32:45.667]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[02:32:45.828 --> 02:32:49.230]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.
[02:32:49.470 --> 02:32:52.653]  Have a fighting chance with SprayYourPlate.com's Photoblocker.

[02:33:13.899 --> 02:33:14.239]  That's right.
[02:33:38.338 --> 02:33:55.162]  We're bringing up the NIST report, and how they've had to change how physics works, and so a lot of scientists and physicists and architects that weren't involved and didn't believe it was an inside job are now looking, going, you're saying jet fuel made 2600 degree pockets of stuff five weeks later?
[02:33:55.702 --> 02:33:56.882]  Thousands of degrees hotter?
[02:33:56.902 --> 02:34:04.844]  I mean, NIST coming out and saying, now small fires bring down steel buildings, is changing everything.
[02:34:05.104 --> 02:34:05.784]  Mark, continue.
[02:34:07.017 --> 02:34:14.921]  Yeah, I mean, this coincides with the Bush administration's technique from day one.
[02:34:14.981 --> 02:34:22.485]  They have actively sought to discredit science and to really argue with scientific belief.
[02:34:22.505 --> 02:34:34.311]  You know, it doesn't matter whether it's the EPA, the FDA, whatever it is, you know, there's been active warfare on the part of the Bush administration against science.
[02:34:35.103 --> 02:34:38.125]  And this is another clear-cut example of that.
[02:34:38.146 --> 02:34:39.226]  Well, it's like marijuana.
[02:34:39.366 --> 02:34:41.328]  They know marijuana doesn't kill one person a year.
[02:34:41.628 --> 02:34:50.895]  It's a miracle drug with thousands of patented real things it does for cancer, glaucoma, but they're still SWAT teaming people every day where I live looking for marijuana.
[02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:52.737]  Absolutely.
[02:34:52.777 --> 02:34:53.858]  No matter how much
[02:34:54.893 --> 02:34:55.833]  I don't know.
[02:34:55.853 --> 02:34:57.594]  I don't know.
[02:35:15.592 --> 02:35:22.594]  But again, you know, corporate media, the Republican or Democratic Party, they'll just write it off with propaganda.
[02:35:22.674 --> 02:35:24.435]  But that is starting... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:25.595 --> 02:35:38.539]  I'm sorry, but that is what we are seeing right now, which is another, by this NIST report, trying to come out and explain why something that's never happened before did happen, namely three steel buildings collapsing because of a fire in one day.
[02:35:39.099 --> 02:35:41.521]  They do have to stretch the realms of reality.
[02:35:41.541 --> 02:35:47.246]  You know, they do have to contradict science and offer an alternative view, which is completely bogus.
[02:35:47.686 --> 02:36:02.658]  Which is why I'm glad to see that people with, uh, people who are experts, people, you know, whose backgrounds are in this field are coming forward and saying, look, you guys are just straining any credibility you have here to the breaking point.
[02:36:02.718 --> 02:36:03.899]  We can't accept this.
[02:36:04.079 --> 02:36:04.820]  The only thing is,
[02:36:05.603 --> 02:36:11.546]  You know, these are things that are coming out in scientific journals and academic papers that are peer-reviewed.
[02:36:11.566 --> 02:36:15.708]  These are not things that appear on the evening news or are going to be on a front-page headline.
[02:36:15.728 --> 02:36:16.788]  You know, that's a great point.
[02:36:17.428 --> 02:36:18.309]  First, they said...
[02:36:19.594 --> 02:36:22.335]  Like, three or four years ago, oh, let's see some studies.
[02:36:22.395 --> 02:36:23.255]  And then they did studies.
[02:36:23.295 --> 02:36:24.355]  Let's see them be peer-reviewed.
[02:36:24.375 --> 02:36:33.818]  Then a couple of them get peer-reviewed by major, major peer-reviewed, I mean, not just side journals, big marquee, you know, Super Bowl-level journals.
[02:36:33.838 --> 02:36:34.898]  We're talking the big ones.
[02:36:35.218 --> 02:36:36.379]  You know, the most prestigious.
[02:36:36.739 --> 02:36:38.479]  And then they try to write that off.
[02:36:38.579 --> 02:36:44.081]  I mean, we keep clearing every hurdle, Mark, and the other side is just looking stupider and stupider.
[02:36:45.043 --> 02:36:50.348]  And I believe that NIST itself is part of the executive branch, correct?
[02:36:50.408 --> 02:36:50.988]  Yes, yes.
[02:36:51.709 --> 02:37:11.125]  So there we see another example, you know, just like the Office of National Drug Control Policy is part of the executive branch, and they are the ones who constantly spew forth misinformation about the drug war, we have NIST, which is also an executive branch administration, you know, leading the charge about the lies regarding 9-11.
[02:37:13.081 --> 02:37:17.245]  Well, like you said though, more and more people are tuning out of mainstream media.
[02:37:17.366 --> 02:37:28.517]  It's exponential, and instead of them reporting some of the truth or trying to act more credible, it seems like they're getting more shrill, more cartoonish, more ridiculous, piling lie on top of lie.
[02:37:29.098 --> 02:37:32.001]  I don't know what the tactic is there, but it doesn't seem to be working, Mark.
[02:37:32.962 --> 02:37:39.288]  Well, it reminds me of the old quote about, and I can't remember who said it, but it's just the old quote about truth coming out, you know.
[02:37:39.809 --> 02:37:50.900]  First, when you are a truth teller, you know, in this age of universal deceit that we live in, where those of us are trying to commit a revolutionary act by telling the truth,
[02:37:51.640 --> 02:37:56.063]  You know, it becomes evident that we will be attacked.
[02:37:56.763 --> 02:37:58.624]  That's the first method.
[02:37:59.805 --> 02:38:05.388]  Actually, the first method is to be written off and ridiculed, and that was the case early on after September 11th.
[02:38:05.429 --> 02:38:09.931]  We were all pigeon-holed as conspiracy theorists and we were out of our minds, so that was the ridicule.
[02:38:10.371 --> 02:38:14.114]  Then you had the vicious attacks, and now it's becoming obvious that
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:19.481]  You know, the 9-11 truth movement is based on truth and facts and evidence.
[02:38:19.901 --> 02:38:23.522]  We are being maliciously attacked.
[02:38:23.722 --> 02:38:32.024]  Yes, and that's... You know, I just want to follow up by, again, with that famous quotation, the third stage of the truth being accepted is that people will accept it.
[02:38:32.884 --> 02:38:34.864]  So I think now we are in the second stage.
[02:38:34.884 --> 02:38:37.585]  You know, those first few years we were attacked and vilified.
[02:38:38.205 --> 02:38:40.085]  I'm sorry, we were ridiculed.
[02:38:40.386 --> 02:38:42.266]  Now we are being attacked and vilified.
[02:38:43.146 --> 02:38:59.075]  Hopefully we are coming close to that third stage where there will be mass acceptance of this truth and people won't be afraid to put aside their cognitive dissonance and step out and accept this new paradigm of reality that we all have to see around us.
[02:38:59.555 --> 02:39:00.516]  Oh, beautifully put.
[02:39:00.596 --> 02:39:16.886]  And that's really, I don't blame a lot of people who don't want to look at the facts, because every night when I go to bed, I look at how innocent my children are, I look at how good my wife is, and I just think, God, there are really evil people in this world, and they really are in control, and I've really gotten their face, and man, I've been threatened, and this is dangerous.
[02:39:17.366 --> 02:39:20.368]  Then I realize, you know, I just can't let the world go on like this.
[02:39:20.428 --> 02:39:23.250]  I've got to do my job, whether it has an effect or not.
[02:39:23.290 --> 02:39:28.593]  But the truth is, when good people do get involved, I believe, as Thomas Jefferson said, that we can overturn evil.
[02:39:29.033 --> 02:39:29.974]  Evil only wins.
[02:39:31.514 --> 02:39:32.495]  Men and women do nothing.
[02:39:33.255 --> 02:39:33.755]  And you're right.
[02:39:33.835 --> 02:39:36.977]  First they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.
[02:39:37.477 --> 02:39:39.919]  And that's basically what's happening now.
[02:39:40.039 --> 02:39:45.461]  And there's another quote I'm butchering, paraphrasing, but truth goes through three stages.
[02:39:46.002 --> 02:39:52.025]  First it's laughed at, then it's ridiculed, then it's accepted as universally true.
[02:39:52.685 --> 02:39:56.427]  And people who said the world was round were laughed at, and now we know it's round, Mark.
[02:39:57.605 --> 02:40:03.246]  Well, yeah, and just, you know, for me personally, you know, again, I think we should all just do what we can.
[02:40:03.366 --> 02:40:09.408]  You know, different people have different amounts of time, different resources, be they financial or whatever.
[02:40:10.288 --> 02:40:14.969]  But I just felt, personally, as an American citizen, it was my duty to speak out.
[02:40:15.069 --> 02:40:21.270]  You know, I was asked to do a newspaper article for my hometown.
[02:40:22.188 --> 02:40:25.150]  And it was just one of those deals, where are they now?
[02:40:25.270 --> 02:40:27.151]  What are they doing now that they're retired?
[02:40:27.691 --> 02:40:34.475]  And I just, again, I felt compelled to at least let people in Erie, Pennsylvania, my hometown, who read the paper,
[02:40:35.399 --> 02:40:45.890]  No, that somebody who came from there doesn't believe in the official story of 9-11 and wholeheartedly believes that they too should seek out the truth for themselves.
[02:40:46.290 --> 02:40:55.400]  What type of response, I know overwhelmingly it was positive, but what type of negative responses did you get and what was it like with your moral courage to go through that and not recant?
[02:40:57.522 --> 02:41:00.847]  Well, you know, the reaction overwhelmingly was positive.
[02:41:00.887 --> 02:41:08.578]  I mean, I don't spend a lot of time in my hometown anymore, and I know that there were people who wrote in letters saying, you know, what's wrong with this guy?
[02:41:08.638 --> 02:41:10.261]  He's way out in that field.
[02:41:10.942 --> 02:41:23.886]  But like we discussed earlier, now that we are coming up on eight years after the fact, people are coming, I'm sorry, seven years after the fact, people are becoming aware of what actually happened that day.
[02:41:23.966 --> 02:41:28.187]  You know, the initial shock value of that psychological operation is wearing off.
[02:41:28.227 --> 02:41:30.928]  People are getting a chance to see what really went on behind the scenes.
[02:41:31.968 --> 02:41:35.809]  So I didn't really suffer much fallout at all.
[02:41:36.629 --> 02:41:37.630]  You know, it was just, again,
[02:41:39.210 --> 02:41:44.733]  Regardless of how many people might write in, there's always going to be a few, you know, who will just personally attack you.
[02:41:44.753 --> 02:41:47.455]  I experienced the same thing when I spoke out against marijuana laws.
[02:41:47.995 --> 02:41:55.439]  You know, you have people saying that you're not a good role model, you know, that you're a proponent of drug use and everything else.
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:42:05.965]  Yeah, but you go to a football game and there's liquor ads everywhere, which no doubt is bad for you, but then, you know, these guys with a whiskey bottle, how dare you be with that marijuana?
[02:42:07.382 --> 02:42:14.564]  Yeah, again, people have blinders on with certain respect to the war on drugs, just like they do with 9-11.
[02:42:15.204 --> 02:42:29.789]  So I just wanted to, again, for people in my hometown who might know who I am or what I stand for, at least they might know enough about me to know that I'm not just some guy spouting off, that I might be a guy who actually does have educated opinions.
[02:42:34.734 --> 02:42:35.255]  Absolutely.
[02:42:35.295 --> 02:42:37.156]  Let's take some calls for Mark Stepnoski.
[02:42:37.477 --> 02:42:42.001]  Mark, before we do that in the last 15 or 16 minutes, any other points you wanted to add?
[02:42:42.081 --> 02:42:43.502]  Anything else you wanted to point out?
[02:42:43.522 --> 02:42:51.369]  I would just like to tell people that they should make a personal commitment in their life to continue to educate themselves on these issues.
[02:42:51.389 --> 02:42:52.751]  You know, the easiest thing in the world
[02:42:53.371 --> 02:42:59.093]  It's just a pigeonhole something and write it off, put a label on it and say, I don't have to look into it any further.
[02:42:59.353 --> 02:43:04.255]  You know, they'll just categorize it as something they don't want to know and then just move on.
[02:43:04.295 --> 02:43:05.596]  That's the easiest thing to do.
[02:43:05.716 --> 02:43:08.397]  And I say intellectually, that's a lazy thing to do.
[02:43:09.097 --> 02:43:11.881]  I think people should take it upon themselves to have the initiative.
[02:43:12.281 --> 02:43:18.569]  If you're going to disprove something, if you're going to write it off, at least look into it and have an educated opinion about it.
[02:43:20.532 --> 02:43:25.238]  I know there's a lot of nonsense out there regarding any topic, including 9-11.
[02:43:27.981 --> 02:43:33.907]  I would just tell people to look into anything they can, like some of the things I mentioned earlier.
[02:43:33.947 --> 02:43:38.030]  Scholars from 9-11 Truth, any 9-11 Truth chapter.
[02:43:38.251 --> 02:43:42.595]  Cities all over North America have their own separate 9-11 Truth factor.
[02:43:42.615 --> 02:43:46.819]  We have a great one here in Toronto, Vancouver, British Columbia.
[02:43:47.479 --> 02:43:51.202]  As well as Toronto and Ottawa, across Canada, just like in the States.
[02:43:51.763 --> 02:43:53.584]  I need to send you Truth Rising.
[02:43:53.764 --> 02:43:55.726]  We've got Canadian, U.S.
[02:43:55.746 --> 02:43:56.406]  9-11 Truth.
[02:43:56.446 --> 02:43:57.907]  We are changed, just exploding.
[02:43:58.568 --> 02:43:59.769]  That new film just came out.
[02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:01.650]  I know you've seen Terror Storm.
[02:44:01.690 --> 02:44:02.531]  What did you think of that film?
[02:44:03.519 --> 02:44:04.820]  I thought it was outstanding.
[02:44:05.281 --> 02:44:07.403]  There are a lot of great movies out right now.
[02:44:07.443 --> 02:44:18.092]  There's a current one people can watch on YouTube called Shadowplay, which is an excellent synopsis of the 9-11 false flag terror attack.
[02:44:18.152 --> 02:44:23.157]  It's a film that's coming out in segments, and they can watch those on YouTube.
[02:44:23.197 --> 02:44:28.862]  That's an excellent education for anybody who wants to kind of get a crash course on this subject.
[02:44:29.122 --> 02:44:32.607]  Well, and remember folks, the evil people that did this are still there.
[02:44:32.767 --> 02:44:34.229]  And I wish they were in a cave.
[02:44:34.530 --> 02:44:37.073]  That's a lot less scary than knowing they're in control of our government.
[02:44:39.273 --> 02:44:40.273]  No question about it.
[02:44:40.333 --> 02:44:46.475]  I mean, we see now in a Dutch newspaper talk of an attack on Iran as imminent.
[02:44:48.856 --> 02:44:56.097]  I'm so glad to see that you're at the Democratic National Convention, because people seem to think that if we get a Democrat in office, there's going to be big changes.
[02:44:56.157 --> 02:45:01.679]  But the Democratic Congress has already signed off on a preemptive nuclear attack against Iran.
[02:45:02.359 --> 02:45:02.880]  Absolutely.
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:09.364]  I don't know how anybody can expect anything to the contrary should Democrats be in power.
[02:45:32.459 --> 02:45:39.621]  Hi Alex and Mark.
[02:45:39.901 --> 02:45:43.082]  I give you a lot of credit for what you're doing.
[02:45:43.122 --> 02:45:51.164]  I'm involved in a situation here now where I'm experiencing my friend and girlfriend of 12 years is being soft killed as we speak.
[02:45:51.824 --> 02:45:54.207]  She has a brother that's in the State Department.
[02:45:54.587 --> 02:45:57.790]  She gave him a copy of The Road to Tyranny in about 2002.
[02:45:58.491 --> 02:46:01.674]  And ever since then, her family's really been against us.
[02:46:02.235 --> 02:46:04.637]  She was an experimental guinea pig back in 1958.
[02:46:05.218 --> 02:46:06.659]  We had her thymus radiated.
[02:46:07.460 --> 02:46:11.985]  She's always had lifelong allergies and actually a victim of sexual abuse when she was a child.
[02:46:12.025 --> 02:46:13.867]  Her mother brought foster kids into the house.
[02:46:14.608 --> 02:46:21.931]  On July of this year, she finally found out that she had a lot of thyroid problems and a lot of hormone deficiencies causing some memory problems.
[02:46:22.792 --> 02:46:29.855]  About a month later, her brother came home from where he works in the State Department, coerced her into going to lunch with her.
[02:46:29.895 --> 02:46:30.795]  She never came home.
[02:46:30.855 --> 02:46:33.016]  What he did is told her he was going to get her to a doctor.
[02:46:33.036 --> 02:46:36.958]  The next day, he put her into the psychiatric ward up at Strong Memorial.
[02:46:38.078 --> 02:46:41.260]  Well, sir, you need to put the names, the emails, the facts.
[02:46:41.300 --> 02:46:42.500]  I need to confirm this happened.
[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:43.921]  I believe you, but I need to confirm it.
[02:46:44.261 --> 02:46:46.222]  That's big news, so let me stop you.
[02:46:46.522 --> 02:46:53.324]  So because she was a 9-11 truther, she's been stuck in a mental ward, and we're starting to see this happen like the old Soviet Union.
[02:46:53.624 --> 02:46:59.987]  I'm going to get your name and number off air, and then we'll have you on as a guest if I can see some documents and confirm this.
[02:47:00.407 --> 02:47:13.496]  But we have seen calls, it's in the new film Truth Rising, all the major cable channels saying, kill Alex Jones, put them in FEMA camps, they're terrorists, Taser 9-11 truthers, send them to Gitmo, and they're serious.
[02:47:14.377 --> 02:47:16.839]  Mark Sipnosky, I mean, they're getting scared of us now.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:19.000]  Yeah, no question.
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:20.842]  You'll see it across the board.
[02:47:21.082 --> 02:47:26.226]  Yeah, you know, whether it's Geraldo Rivera or Bill Maher or any of these guys who
[02:47:27.378 --> 02:47:40.369]  You are in a position where they have a show on corporate media and the only way they're going to continue to maintain their show is to spout the lies of the current administration, you know, the corporate party line.
[02:47:44.477 --> 02:47:53.640]  Yeah, well, again, you know, it's, uh... I think Sinclair Lewis said, when fascism comes to America, it'll be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:56.001]  Yep, that's what Ron Paul said and got in trouble.
[02:47:56.041 --> 02:47:57.441]  He's not saying Christians are bad.
[02:47:57.721 --> 02:47:59.602]  He's saying evil people will use that.
[02:48:00.382 --> 02:48:04.824]  Yeah, I mean, if that's not what we're seeing right now, I don't know what we're seeing.
[02:48:04.884 --> 02:48:10.766]  Because, you know, we are looking at, again, the corporate ownership of both political parties.
[02:48:12.353 --> 02:48:14.634]  Again, wrapped in a flag, carrying a cross.
[02:48:16.916 --> 02:48:26.401]  In defense of religion and freedom, they are trying to ramrod a whole system of laws through that is to the detriment of everybody.
[02:48:26.501 --> 02:48:28.742]  You got it, and it has nothing to do with Christianity.
[02:48:28.903 --> 02:48:31.584]  Adam in Texas, you're on the air with Mark Sipnosky, go ahead.
[02:48:31.604 --> 02:48:34.126]  Hey Mark, it's great to talk to you.
[02:48:35.496 --> 02:48:38.961]  I watched you through your career and some of the finest football I've ever seen.
[02:48:38.981 --> 02:48:41.984]  I was wondering if you caught Alex up there.
[02:48:43.146 --> 02:48:50.467]  Behind the MSNBC counter, and I wonder if you've met anybody more tenacious and more wonderful than Alex Jones.
[02:48:50.648 --> 02:48:51.508]  Oh, come on.
[02:48:51.528 --> 02:48:53.348]  Sounds like a setup call.
[02:48:53.948 --> 02:48:54.708]  It's not.
[02:48:55.448 --> 02:49:03.410]  I did see the clip online where T-Boom Pickens was being interviewed on MSNBC in the background.
[02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:05.711]  That was Minneapolis 9-11 Truth.
[02:49:05.751 --> 02:49:07.751]  We took over for three hours at the DNC.
[02:49:09.387 --> 02:49:10.688]  I think that's outstanding.
[02:49:10.728 --> 02:49:25.574]  I think, again, like we saw with Geraldo Rivera and like we saw with Bill Maher, there's going to have to continue, and we are change people who do it everywhere, there has to continue to be a breakthrough into mainstream media of 9-11 truth.
[02:49:26.634 --> 02:49:32.337]  Again, it's become obvious that we're not going to have a top-down solution to this problem.
[02:49:32.457 --> 02:49:34.838]  You know, the censorship is coming from top-down.
[02:49:34.918 --> 02:49:35.758]  It's going to be bottom-up.
[02:49:36.483 --> 02:49:37.064]  Exactly.
[02:49:37.104 --> 02:49:41.527]  It's going to have to be grassroots, and that's the beauty of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:49:41.727 --> 02:49:44.629]  You know, people, it's a grassroots movement.
[02:49:44.749 --> 02:49:52.354]  People don't have to rely on anything else other than their fellow citizens who want to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth.
[02:49:52.454 --> 02:49:53.135]  Well, exactly.
[02:49:53.155 --> 02:49:54.395]  I have to use the football analogy.
[02:49:54.455 --> 02:49:54.996]  What's it called?
[02:49:55.036 --> 02:50:04.062]  What's the term, I'll dip my tongue, where the ball is moved by running, you know, just a foot at a time, a long battle down the whole field?
[02:50:04.622 --> 02:50:04.843]  Yes.
[02:50:06.118 --> 02:50:08.039]  Yeah, time of possession.
[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:14.384]  You're going to eat up the clock.
[02:50:15.384 --> 02:50:16.986]  Ground war, whatever it's called.
[02:50:17.246 --> 02:50:17.886]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:50:18.347 --> 02:50:19.087]  That's what this is.
[02:50:19.107 --> 02:50:20.628]  We've gone like 80 yards.
[02:50:20.908 --> 02:50:22.069]  We've got 20 more to go.
[02:50:22.129 --> 02:50:23.190]  We've got a first down.
[02:50:23.390 --> 02:50:24.651]  We've had all these victories.
[02:50:25.571 --> 02:50:26.512]  Folks, we're winning.
[02:50:26.592 --> 02:50:27.633]  We can win this thing.
[02:50:29.171 --> 02:50:33.795]  Yeah, I think really people should again just concentrate on what they themselves can do.
[02:50:34.576 --> 02:50:36.077]  Don't feel powerless.
[02:50:36.218 --> 02:50:41.402]  Don't think like, you know, you have to accept these things even though you don't believe them.
[02:50:42.303 --> 02:50:47.468]  Every person has it in themselves to make a decision to do what is right.
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:48.820]  Absolutely.
[02:50:48.860 --> 02:50:49.661]  Let's take another call.
[02:50:49.701 --> 02:50:50.902]  I'm going to skip this break too.
[02:50:50.962 --> 02:50:55.785]  Just skip the music as well for the InfoWars.com listers and stations that choose to carry it.
[02:50:55.825 --> 02:50:56.545]  I'm skipping the break.
[02:50:57.326 --> 02:51:01.488]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next?
[02:51:01.528 --> 02:51:02.689]  Tim in North Carolina.
[02:51:02.709 --> 02:51:04.170]  You're on the air with Mark Stepnoski.
[02:51:05.811 --> 02:51:06.211]  Hey guys.
[02:51:06.571 --> 02:51:10.093]  I think it's interesting you came up with the football analogy there, Alex.
[02:51:10.534 --> 02:51:11.934]  That's exactly what I was thinking about.
[02:51:11.974 --> 02:51:14.736]  Mark, did you play defense?
[02:51:15.096 --> 02:51:15.937]  I played center.
[02:51:17.578 --> 02:51:17.718]  Hello?
[02:51:18.729 --> 02:51:19.870]  He played center.
[02:51:19.910 --> 02:51:21.071]  He was offensive lineman.
[02:51:21.732 --> 02:51:22.752]  Offensive lineman?
[02:51:22.993 --> 02:51:30.018]  Well, what I was thinking was, if you're playing defense, and that's what the 9-11 thing is all about, we're defending ourselves against those.
[02:51:30.419 --> 02:51:33.861]  Free yourself from expensive cable and satellite fees.
[02:51:34.022 --> 02:51:35.903]  Control what you want to see.
[02:51:35.983 --> 02:51:42.749]  GCN listeners, now you can transform your living room's HDTV into a virtual war room command center with ZV.
[02:51:43.369 --> 02:51:49.474]  ZV turns your computer into your own HD channel that broadcasts throughout your home to all of your HD TVs.

[02:52:10.692 --> 02:52:11.212]  We're good.
[02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:36.748]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[02:52:37.108 --> 02:52:39.090]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[02:52:39.751 --> 02:52:40.792]  But who is the enemy?
[02:52:41.313 --> 02:52:41.853]  Bin Laden.
[02:52:42.094 --> 02:52:42.935]  This is his MO.
[02:52:42.975 --> 02:52:44.456]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[02:52:44.496 --> 02:52:44.957]  We have to look to...
[02:52:44.977 --> 02:52:45.177]  Some U.S.
[02:52:45.197 --> 02:52:48.660]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[02:53:00.431 --> 02:53:03.934]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[02:53:04.315 --> 02:53:14.183]  ...Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[02:53:14.203 --> 02:53:15.184]  Fabled enemies.

[02:54:02.199 --> 02:54:06.122]  This message has been brought to you by Radio Credit Secrets dot com.
[02:54:31.399 --> 02:54:39.003]  It's an inside job, folks.
[02:54:39.124 --> 02:54:45.607]  Final segment with Mark Stavnoski.
[02:54:55.473 --> 02:55:00.694]  Marker, do you have a personal website or is there a site you want to plug or something you want to say here at the end?
[02:55:02.215 --> 02:55:15.158]  Well, again, I would just, you know, for those of us in Canada, I would just like again to bring up the march that the 9-11 True Society of Vancouver has orchestrated.
[02:55:16.398 --> 02:55:17.358]  It's already began.
[02:55:17.418 --> 02:55:24.060]  It's going to culminate in Ottawa on September 15th, I believe, today there in Sudbury and Toronto, Ontario.
[02:55:24.952 --> 02:55:29.595]  These 9-11 tutors have been traveling across the country to get petitions.
[02:55:30.035 --> 02:55:35.179]  They're going to march from Montreal to Ottawa and arrive on September 11th.
[02:55:36.992 --> 02:55:52.676]  With all the signatures that they get nationwide on this petition, and this is for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada, because what people forget is 9-11 was, it was obviously portrayed as an attack against America, but it was a worldwide crime.
[02:55:52.736 --> 02:55:57.557]  There were citizens, I believe, from over 80 countries in the World Trade Center.
[02:55:57.677 --> 02:56:03.023]  And it totally freaks out the global controllers when we're out marching, when we don't shut up, when we don't stop.
[02:56:03.243 --> 02:56:04.424]  They tell us we don't have power.
[02:56:04.504 --> 02:56:05.445]  We know that's a lie.
[02:56:06.226 --> 02:56:08.849]  An enemy will always tell you you don't have a chance to win, folks.
[02:56:08.869 --> 02:56:10.190]  That's psychological warfare.
[02:56:10.250 --> 02:56:11.952]  We don't just have a chance.
[02:56:12.012 --> 02:56:12.893]  We are going to win.
[02:56:12.913 --> 02:56:13.794]  We are never going to stop.
[02:56:14.295 --> 02:56:15.296]  A couple final calls.
[02:56:15.416 --> 02:56:16.457]  Victor in Canada.
[02:56:16.737 --> 02:56:18.879]  Speaking of Canada, you're on the air with Mark Stepnowski.
[02:56:18.900 --> 02:56:19.180]  Go ahead.
[02:56:20.157 --> 02:56:20.838]  Hi there.
[02:56:21.038 --> 02:56:23.580]  Thanks, Mark, for everything you're doing, including plugging the March on Ottawa.
[02:56:23.600 --> 02:56:24.601]  I'm actually from Ottawa.
[02:56:25.401 --> 02:56:26.923]  I have a comment and a question.
[02:56:27.043 --> 02:56:31.006]  First, my question is, what advice do you have for closet celebrity truthers?
[02:56:33.068 --> 02:56:39.473]  I would tell them just to, instead of having a fear of the unknown, just come forward and speak the truth.
[02:56:39.533 --> 02:56:40.534]  Speak from your heart.
[02:56:41.391 --> 02:56:49.681]  You know, be honest with people, have facts to back up your point of view, and I really think that being the case, there's nothing for people to fear.
[02:56:49.861 --> 02:56:52.945]  Hey, think about Charlie Sheen, especially with his baggage.
[02:56:53.025 --> 02:56:54.267]  He was the first.
[02:56:54.908 --> 02:56:55.909]  Think about what he did.
[02:56:57.122 --> 02:56:59.444]  People appreciate someone who's willing to come forward.
[02:56:59.484 --> 02:57:05.427]  I think as time goes on, people are realizing how sanitized and censored mainstream media is.
[02:57:05.928 --> 02:57:17.015]  And whether somebody is a 9-11 truther who tells the truth, or a politician who's willing to give up the talking points and just, you know, speak truthfully, people appreciate that because it's so rare.
[02:57:17.375 --> 02:57:18.076]  Absolutely.
[02:57:18.836 --> 02:57:25.619]  Absolutely, that's what matters in this world is conviction and honor and duty and goodness and Mark Sipnoski and many others have got it.
[02:57:25.719 --> 02:57:30.741]  I just love to be part of this brotherhood, this sisterhood of man, of people that stand up and have courage.
[02:57:31.021 --> 02:57:33.722]  Real fast, Norman in North Carolina, you've got about 30 seconds.
[02:57:35.783 --> 02:57:40.025]  Hello gentlemen, thank you for taking my call and thank you for keeping the truth sacred.
[02:57:40.825 --> 02:57:45.147]  I believe that if the truth can be told so as to be understood that it will be believed
[02:57:45.732 --> 02:57:48.056]  And that's what you do so well, Alex, and I'm proud.
[02:57:48.376 --> 02:57:52.482]  I'm a proud InfoWarrior, working to wake up anyone with a pulse and an attention span.
[02:57:52.983 --> 02:57:57.089]  And it just, it gives me a true sense of purpose and a real feeling of patriotism.
[02:57:57.788 --> 02:58:05.551]  And I intuit that we have critical mass, and given that the news report is laughable, it's just a matter of time before we have resolutions.
[02:58:05.851 --> 02:58:07.552]  God bless you guys, and thank you so much.
[02:58:07.852 --> 02:58:08.312]  Absolutely.
[02:58:08.332 --> 02:58:09.573]  Let me be clear here at the end.
[02:58:09.673 --> 02:58:11.494]  We reached critical mass years ago.
[02:58:11.514 --> 02:58:17.736]  In every major poll, the majority believe that there's a cover-up, a huge portion of that majority believe inside job.
[02:58:18.036 --> 02:58:22.178]  And those are in polls when they're calling somebody up, and folks usually don't answer controversially.
[02:58:22.825 --> 02:58:23.986]  We've reached critical mass.
[02:58:24.286 --> 02:58:27.369]  People just don't realize that the majority of us know the truth and we're scared.
[02:58:27.669 --> 02:58:33.254]  People like Mark Stepnowski stepping up to the plate, that lets people see the courage and lets them know that we're not alone.
[02:58:33.554 --> 02:58:34.735]  In fact, that we're the majority.
[02:58:35.156 --> 02:58:37.918]  And so now we've just got to take back control of our government.
[02:58:38.198 --> 02:58:39.119]  We are the majority.
[02:58:39.439 --> 02:58:41.902]  Mark Stepnowski, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:58:41.922 --> 02:58:45.645]  I want to say bye to you on the show ends here in about 30 seconds, but anything else you want to add?
[02:58:46.773 --> 02:58:49.135]  Well, I just want to say it's been nice being with you.
[02:58:49.215 --> 02:58:51.097]  Thanks again for the opportunity to come on.
[02:58:51.157 --> 02:58:51.937]  I appreciate it.
[02:58:52.498 --> 02:58:53.238]  I appreciate you.
[02:58:53.258 --> 02:58:54.739]  Stay right there, my friend, for 20 seconds.
[02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:58.042]  I'm going to be right there at the end to talk to you for a second, say bye to you personally.

[03:00:47.885 --> 03:00:51.990]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:56.312 --> 03:01:02.574]  We've got more of that interview I did with Tom Morello coming up later in the broadcast today for Rage Against the Machine.
[03:01:02.594 --> 03:01:06.595]  We bumped into it at the DMC last week, just now airing that here.
[03:01:06.615 --> 03:01:10.077]  But for the next 30 minutes, Henry Rollins.
[03:01:10.137 --> 03:01:12.517]  I guess it's Rockstar Day here on the show.
[03:01:13.338 --> 03:01:18.639]  Henry Rollins, I remember being a little teenager listening to Black Flag and stuff like that.
[03:01:18.659 --> 03:01:20.260]  Of course, he has the Henry Rollins Band.
[03:01:21.019 --> 03:01:22.280]  And a lot of you know who he is.
[03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:26.262]  Some of you out there with a very diverse audience might not know who he is.
[03:01:26.282 --> 03:01:32.346]  But we'll get out some of the websites and tell you about his tour that is going around the country and the world right now.
[03:01:32.406 --> 03:01:36.809]  But I wanted to get his take on web censorship, how they're trying to censor and shut down the web.
[03:01:37.209 --> 03:01:39.391]  He's really been fighting against that, and I agree with him there.
[03:01:39.791 --> 03:01:44.274]  His kind of complex and nuanced view on terrorism, the police state.
[03:01:45.635 --> 03:01:47.356]  We'll be talking to him here in the next 30 minutes.
[03:01:47.596 --> 03:01:49.117]  Henry Rollins, thanks for coming on with us.
[03:01:49.677 --> 03:01:50.197]  Oh, fine.
[03:01:50.237 --> 03:01:54.700]  Let's talk about my nuanced and complex view on terrorism.
[03:01:55.701 --> 03:01:56.741]  You want to get into that first?
[03:01:57.202 --> 03:02:00.323]  Well, I don't... How my nuanced or complex?
[03:02:01.204 --> 03:02:09.929]  Well, I'm trying to say it that way because I haven't had too much time to fully, constantly follow what you're doing, but every few months I see something you've said or done, and it seems diverse.
[03:02:09.949 --> 03:02:14.952]  I don't want to say contradictory, and so by that I meant you can actually flesh it out for us.
[03:02:15.912 --> 03:02:16.353]  Okay.
[03:02:16.673 --> 03:02:18.614]  Well, what's the point that sticks with you?
[03:02:20.003 --> 03:02:33.955]  You know, again, over the years, I know people's views change, too, and kind of go through changes, and so, I mean, tell us your view on the police state versus terrorism, kind of the whole New World Order, Henry.
[03:02:35.276 --> 03:02:36.618]  The police state in America?
[03:02:36.998 --> 03:02:37.278]  Yes.
[03:02:37.558 --> 03:02:40.301]  The amelioration of civil liberties?
[03:02:40.541 --> 03:02:40.781]  Yes.
[03:02:41.482 --> 03:02:45.986]  Well, I think it's part and parcel with the Bush administration.
[03:02:46.718 --> 03:02:56.063]  And I think a lot of it doesn't do anything to combat terrorism domestically or outside of America.
[03:02:57.033 --> 03:03:20.164]  The fact that the Washington Post had to brief America that Homeland Security finds it okay to detain your electronic media, your laptop or anything, your iPod, when you come into an airport in America, a foreigner or an American citizen, and they can take your laptop or whatever and download the information, distribute the information to all the intelligence agencies at an off-site location,
[03:03:21.150 --> 03:03:25.935]  And hold on to that information and your computer or anything else for as long as they feel.
[03:03:25.955 --> 03:03:30.940]  Enough Europeans complained that finally the Washington Post broke this story.
[03:03:30.960 --> 03:03:35.164]  A lot of Americans, myself included, did not know that they could do that.
[03:03:35.664 --> 03:03:36.065]  I don't know.
[03:03:37.006 --> 03:03:52.539]  How taking my laptop away from me is going to stop the anger that is engendered by people in the world when we go into their countries and push them around.
[03:03:52.939 --> 03:03:56.983]  And so checking my laptop or reading my email
[03:03:57.783 --> 03:04:00.585]  Or being able to tap my phones easily.
[03:04:01.085 --> 03:04:10.112]  I don't know what that is, how that's going to help ease down terror in Saudi Arabia or, you know, anger felt in Egypt or Morocco.
[03:04:10.152 --> 03:04:14.575]  Well, we know it isn't, but it's going to allow the military-industrial complex to train the American people.
[03:04:14.595 --> 03:04:19.598]  They have no liberties or freedoms and condition us to line up and put our hands up and have no Fourth Amendment.
[03:04:20.179 --> 03:04:20.399]  Right.
[03:04:20.679 --> 03:04:24.782]  And that's too bad, because a lot of Americans will start to think
[03:04:25.962 --> 03:04:28.443]  The thing I really hate is when someone says, well, I've got nothing to hide.
[03:04:28.983 --> 03:04:30.464]  Well, that's not really the point.
[03:04:31.384 --> 03:04:36.406]  When you say you have nothing to hide, basically, you've just basically cowed and caved into this.
[03:04:37.226 --> 03:04:39.427]  And I think a review is in order.
[03:04:39.787 --> 03:04:43.448]  But meanwhile, the national security state is becoming more secretive than ever.
[03:04:43.488 --> 03:04:46.969]  They've made it national security where they can dump toxic waste and we can't know.
[03:04:47.589 --> 03:04:47.889]  Right.
[03:04:48.730 --> 03:04:52.931]  And again, you know, this is just, if you're in the big business,
[03:04:53.571 --> 03:05:05.577]  If you really need the rails greased to get things going, and you don't want government in the way of pushing things through, and one of the ways you kind of clear the path is to scare the living hell out of people.
[03:05:06.117 --> 03:05:09.639]  And when the going gets rough, the average get conservative, and that's the story of America.
[03:05:10.159 --> 03:05:16.822]  And a lot of Americans who hate this country or can't stand that country, they get their information from Sean Hannity, yet they can't find
[03:05:17.802 --> 03:05:19.123]  All right, Henry Rollins, stay there.
[03:05:19.163 --> 03:05:21.985]  We're going to be back in three quick minutes to talk more with us.
[03:05:31.357 --> 03:05:32.838]  Hello, this is Steve Shank.
[03:05:33.198 --> 03:05:36.600]  The economic disaster is taking food out of the mouths of our families.
[03:05:37.021 --> 03:05:40.923]  Farmers, food brokers, and grocery stores can't get credit to supply your food.
[03:05:41.423 --> 03:05:44.565]  Over a third of us can't afford to buy food and pay our other expenses.
[03:05:45.045 --> 03:05:47.947]  Lines of credit and cards are often cut back or cancelled.
[03:05:48.267 --> 03:05:51.009]  Last year, the eFoods Direct Holiday Food Unit was
[03:05:51.089 --> 03:05:51.509]  I think so.
[03:06:02.626 --> 03:06:08.669]  This super supply costs $300 less than the basic Liberty one-year supply and has more food.
[03:06:09.269 --> 03:06:12.570]  Safe food for less than half the cost of last year's groceries.
[03:06:13.211 --> 03:06:16.752]  For delivery by Christmas, orders must be submitted by the end of November.
[03:06:17.393 --> 03:06:20.974]  Good food is a gift of life and love this holiday season.
[03:06:21.394 --> 03:06:21.814]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web.
[03:06:21.834 --> 03:06:22.435]  efoodsdirect.com 800-409-5633
[03:06:30.797 --> 03:06:37.206]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:06:37.566 --> 03:06:39.549]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:06:40.210 --> 03:06:41.252]  But who is the enemy?
[03:06:41.752 --> 03:06:42.273]  Bin Laden.
[03:06:42.553 --> 03:06:43.374]  This is his ammo.
[03:06:43.434 --> 03:06:44.917]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:06:44.937 --> 03:06:45.938]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:06:46.038 --> 03:06:50.220]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:52.381]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:07:04.588 --> 03:07:14.630]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijacker's ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[03:07:14.850 --> 03:07:15.610]  Fabled enemies.
[03:07:16.090 --> 03:07:23.372]  Get the DVD at InfoWars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:07:23.612 --> 03:07:27.233]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[03:07:30.962 --> 03:07:39.704]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:07:39.884 --> 03:07:44.665]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:07:45.045 --> 03:07:56.148]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:07:56.548 --> 03:08:02.112]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[03:08:02.352 --> 03:08:08.416]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[03:08:08.617 --> 03:08:09.257]  What about you?
[03:08:09.637 --> 03:08:11.559]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[03:08:54.986 --> 03:09:00.488]  Alright, coming in with some Henry Rollins.
[03:09:00.528 --> 03:09:01.389]  Rise Above.
[03:09:03.689 --> 03:09:16.694]  Probably the most popular, long-lasting punk rocker out there, but that's only one label you can throw on him.
[03:09:16.734 --> 03:09:20.855]  Hardcore punk, alternative rock, punk rock, heavy metal, noise rock, spoken word.
[03:09:21.738 --> 03:09:27.667]  Musician, singer, songwriter, actor, stand-up comedian, author, and the list goes on and on.
[03:09:27.707 --> 03:09:28.809]  Radio talk show host.
[03:09:29.169 --> 03:09:30.491]  He is Henry Rollins.
[03:09:30.532 --> 03:09:31.253]  We were getting into
[03:09:31.940 --> 03:09:45.870]  His views on the whole police state and what's happening, and we were going over the fact that having you line up and have them kidnap your laptop without a warrant, that's all part of setting a precedent that there is no Bill of Rights or Constitution and using the threat of terrorism as a pretext.
[03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:59.140]  Henry, what do you think about government-sponsored terrorism like Gulf of Tonkin, or the Reichstag, or the USS Liberty, or the Maine Operation Gladio, Operation Cyclone,
[03:10:00.246 --> 03:10:03.311]  I mean, I'm not defending the Soviets, but it's been now declassified that the U.S.
[03:10:03.351 --> 03:10:08.519]  actually funded the Muslims, Mujahideen, to attack the Russians first to get them to come into Afghanistan.
[03:10:08.819 --> 03:10:11.683]  Zbigniew Brzezinski just published a book last year bragging about that.
[03:10:12.685 --> 03:10:15.329]  I mean, your take basically on that whole angle of society.
[03:10:19.774 --> 03:10:22.676]  I think it's basically all the same thing.
[03:10:22.876 --> 03:10:23.396]  It's business.
[03:10:24.297 --> 03:10:27.439]  It's why Kennedy got a bullet, because he's getting in the way of business.
[03:10:28.780 --> 03:10:32.503]  He didn't want the Vietnam War, and so he had to die.
[03:10:33.003 --> 03:10:36.726]  Gulf of Tonkin was our entrance into that conflict, because it's a payday.
[03:10:37.786 --> 03:10:38.647]  So was Pearl Harbor.
[03:10:38.747 --> 03:10:41.549]  It was our gateway into World War II, a payday.
[03:10:42.436 --> 03:10:43.938]  And that's what we do.
[03:10:44.098 --> 03:10:45.319]  That's what this country does.
[03:10:45.359 --> 03:10:47.642]  We're the largest seller of arms in the world.
[03:10:48.543 --> 03:10:59.915]  And now that the thing in Iraq has the threat of cooling down in 2011, the powers that be are reheating the Cold War so we can just keep fighting somebody.
[03:11:00.876 --> 03:11:02.098]  Peace threatens these people.
[03:11:02.928 --> 03:11:10.293]  And they have such contempt for the American people that they tell us on the news that Russia snuck attack Georgia when it's the complete opposite.
[03:11:10.814 --> 03:11:13.355]  Yeah, well, we need to fight people.
[03:11:13.676 --> 03:11:19.520]  And one of the things we do when we induct a country into NATO is we sell a bunch of weapons.
[03:11:20.460 --> 03:11:21.361]  The Russians know this.
[03:11:21.441 --> 03:11:22.561]  That's why they're angry.
[03:11:22.581 --> 03:11:29.465]  Because basically we're going to sell them AR-15s and they're not going to have Kalashnikovs.
[03:11:30.506 --> 03:11:32.286]  And so it's never hearts and minds.
[03:11:32.366 --> 03:11:35.488]  It's never the threat of communism or the spread of peace.
[03:11:35.568 --> 03:11:36.088]  It's business.
[03:11:36.429 --> 03:11:37.329]  It's always business.
[03:11:37.629 --> 03:11:38.650]  It always has been business.
[03:11:39.450 --> 03:11:44.394]  And with this administration, the Bush administration, it's never been so naked and in your face.
[03:11:44.575 --> 03:11:51.921]  And the way to make millions of Americans kind of lay down and take it, like I said, you soften them by scaring the hell out of them.
[03:11:52.241 --> 03:11:57.985]  And a lot of them who don't read, who don't read between the lines, who don't question authority, will submit.
[03:11:58.586 --> 03:12:05.452]  Others are, someone like me is a bit more obstreperous and kind of in the way of that.
[03:12:05.512 --> 03:12:06.873]  Because I'm going, nah, I don't think so.
[03:12:07.613 --> 03:12:10.194]  And, uh, George W. Bush has become my travel agent.
[03:12:10.634 --> 03:12:15.316]  When he, you know, rattles his sabers at a country, I get a visa, I book a ticket, and I go.
[03:12:16.157 --> 03:12:21.899]  And, uh, last year, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Pakistan, I went to all those places, had a great time.
[03:12:22.520 --> 03:12:27.642]  I was in Pakistan when Benazir Bhutto was assassinated, which was, uh, extremely intense.
[03:12:27.762 --> 03:12:28.942]  And again, they think we're idiots.
[03:12:29.002 --> 03:12:32.504]  They machine gun her in front of everyone and then say she bumped her head.
[03:12:33.906 --> 03:12:43.328]  Yeah, well, they just assume that no one has the internet, no one checks YouTube, that no one fax checks their stuff.
[03:12:43.388 --> 03:12:46.328]  I mean, what these guys say, it's like they think no one's minding the store.
[03:12:47.408 --> 03:12:55.210]  And I see why they think that, because you see CNN and MSNBC and certainly Fox News basically clearing the way for them.
[03:12:55.530 --> 03:12:57.670]  Because corporate media also has a bottom line.
[03:12:57.870 --> 03:12:58.090]  Money.
[03:12:58.330 --> 03:12:59.011]  They do business.
[03:12:59.651 --> 03:13:00.971]  And if you get in the way of business,
[03:13:02.288 --> 03:13:12.680]  You know, Paul Mullivan and other companies pull the rats, and Roger Ailes isn't going to have that, Rupert Murdoch isn't going to have that, and even the sissies over at CNN aren't going to have that.
[03:13:12.700 --> 03:13:16.504]  So killing is our business, and business is good, and would you say the U.S.
[03:13:17.085 --> 03:13:18.346]  has been the best at doing business?
[03:13:19.728 --> 03:13:20.809]  Yeah, we're very good at it.
[03:13:21.369 --> 03:13:23.572]  And when there's no war, we'll start one.
[03:13:24.611 --> 03:13:27.612]  We go out of our way to sell you something so you can shoot someone else.
[03:13:28.592 --> 03:13:29.772]  And this has to change.
[03:13:30.832 --> 03:13:35.313]  I don't know how much more ordnance needs to be dropped on a country in Laos.
[03:13:36.054 --> 03:13:42.315]  There's like three or four pieces of ordnance still unexploded or undiscovered per person in that country.
[03:13:42.915 --> 03:13:44.115]  That's no way to live.
[03:13:44.315 --> 03:13:45.656]  And we're part of that history.
[03:13:47.036 --> 03:13:47.936]  There's no doubt in that.
[03:13:48.356 --> 03:13:51.097]  That whole war was started, as you said, with a staged event.
[03:13:51.661 --> 03:13:53.381]  Yeah, well, because it's business.
[03:13:54.162 --> 03:13:56.142]  And it's what you do with a bunch of humans.
[03:13:57.562 --> 03:14:01.784]  You fight, you have them fight each other, and you derive money from that.
[03:14:02.384 --> 03:14:07.305]  And I think there's ways for everyone to get paid when you don't need the guns.
[03:14:07.645 --> 03:14:09.245]  Well, I want to talk about those ways.
[03:14:09.645 --> 03:14:15.767]  There's lots of ways where people can all eat and get along, and you don't have to have a war to make your money.
[03:14:17.276 --> 03:14:18.836]  Henry Rollins is our guest.
[03:14:18.876 --> 03:14:27.579]  Henry, fire out some of the websites people to visit, because we're on in places like Austin, Texas, and places like Buffalo, New York, and St.
[03:14:27.639 --> 03:14:28.019]  Louis.
[03:14:28.459 --> 03:14:32.600]  Well, I'm easily found at HenryRollins.com.
[03:14:32.780 --> 03:14:35.381]  I mean, that's easy to access there.
[03:14:35.681 --> 03:14:41.742]  HenryRollins.com, ladies and gentlemen, and you can link through there and find out tour dates.
[03:14:41.762 --> 03:14:43.183]  Now, they won't just be hearing music here.
[03:14:43.203 --> 03:14:44.763]  You also do spoken word.
[03:14:45.518 --> 03:14:46.919]  Yeah, I do a lot of talking shows.
[03:14:47.099 --> 03:14:54.386]  I mean, that's the kind of shows I've been doing for quite a while, and all this year I've been doing speaking dates all over the world.
[03:14:55.907 --> 03:15:00.931]  I shot five documentaries this year, and they're going to be coming out some this year, some next year.
[03:15:02.112 --> 03:15:04.193]  And those trips were really eye-opening.
[03:15:04.233 --> 03:15:12.375]  I shot in Burma a few weeks ago, shot in Thailand, South Africa, Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, and Northern Ireland.
[03:15:12.615 --> 03:15:15.936]  And all those trips were really informative.
[03:15:15.956 --> 03:15:20.198]  You know, when you get out there in these parts of the world, you can learn quite a bit.
[03:15:20.538 --> 03:15:22.558]  You've got one hell of a wanderlust, don't you?
[03:15:23.299 --> 03:15:23.519]  Yeah.
[03:15:23.679 --> 03:15:26.240]  I mean, the world is interesting to me, and I have the means.
[03:15:26.300 --> 03:15:28.500]  I mean, I can get out there and go, and so I do it.
[03:15:28.980 --> 03:15:30.881]  And that's what informs my opinions.
[03:15:31.881 --> 03:15:35.525]  And, you know, what I do on stage, what I write, what I photograph.
[03:15:36.065 --> 03:15:37.326]  And I read.
[03:15:37.427 --> 03:15:38.327]  I mean, you read.
[03:15:38.387 --> 03:15:43.052]  I mean, everyone likes to read books, and I'm a fairly voracious reader, but... Well, that's the problem.
[03:15:43.072 --> 03:15:44.313]  Everybody actually doesn't, as you know.
[03:15:44.693 --> 03:15:51.600]  Well, it's true, but, you know, I think people who listen to your show, or you, you know, you want to know if you pack a book open and you read it.
[03:15:51.800 --> 03:15:55.464]  Yeah, a lot of Americans don't read, and they don't read enough, and hopefully that changes.
[03:15:57.825 --> 03:16:05.667]  Well, the point is, I try and read a lot, and never have I had a book have the same impact on me.
[03:16:06.027 --> 03:16:09.328]  Like, a book about a country is never as relevant as my trip to that country.
[03:16:09.808 --> 03:16:14.229]  And so basically, knowledge without mileage is a bunch of bull to me.
[03:16:14.509 --> 03:16:15.089]  Oh, I agree.
[03:16:15.109 --> 03:16:20.731]  You've got to actually go out and verify and see if that perspective you saw in the book was accurate.
[03:16:20.972 --> 03:16:25.133]  A lot of times you'll find the book was somewhat accurate, but it was their perspective, their lens.
[03:16:25.453 --> 03:16:26.074]  Well, yeah.
[03:16:26.374 --> 03:16:32.656]  And so I kind of like the Indiana Jones version of things, where you just kind of get in there and, you know, you walk through it and you see what happens.
[03:16:33.316 --> 03:16:39.939]  And I do that in Central Asia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, on my own every year.
[03:16:41.448 --> 03:16:44.111]  So, how many countries do you visit a year on average?
[03:16:44.612 --> 03:16:45.173]  It depends.
[03:16:45.894 --> 03:16:49.138]  Between 5 and 20 some.
[03:16:49.478 --> 03:16:52.542]  This year it's been, you know, all of Europe.
[03:16:53.271 --> 03:16:54.192]  Well, a lot of Europe.
[03:16:54.532 --> 03:16:59.635]  Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and then the aforementioned countries.
[03:17:00.096 --> 03:17:02.917]  Where do you see our future going in this nation?
[03:17:02.957 --> 03:17:12.204]  I see it as an empire teetering on the brink of collapse, the dollar devalued, both parties incredibly decadent and delusional, the lies have never been more blatant.
[03:17:12.584 --> 03:17:14.505]  I see that as a desperation move.
[03:17:14.885 --> 03:17:15.906]  I mean, A, do you agree with that?
[03:17:15.966 --> 03:17:17.787]  And B, where do you see the future of this nation?
[03:17:18.167 --> 03:17:20.089]  Well, I agree with what you said.
[03:17:20.769 --> 03:17:26.851]  But I'm optimistic in that I think America is going to have to hit a very hard bottom line.
[03:17:26.931 --> 03:17:29.592]  I mean, we're going to have to fall on our collective butts very hard.
[03:17:30.433 --> 03:17:32.273]  And it's like a cocaine addict.
[03:17:32.293 --> 03:17:37.295]  It might take another million dollars worth of coke for this person to find out that coke is not the answer.
[03:17:37.955 --> 03:17:41.097]  And so maybe another million foreclosures.
[03:17:41.697 --> 03:17:47.319]  And finally, even Kudlow and company will have to admit that all is not well in America.
[03:17:48.240 --> 03:17:49.861]  And so maybe that's what it's going to take.
[03:17:50.261 --> 03:17:55.746]  Maybe it's going to take more countries in the world just basically starting embargoes on America.
[03:17:56.067 --> 03:17:58.329]  Just like, no, you scare us.
[03:17:58.409 --> 03:17:59.910]  We don't want to play with you anymore.
[03:18:01.151 --> 03:18:05.195]  Maybe it'll take the whole world convening some kind of
[03:18:06.976 --> 03:18:25.189]  I don't know, but I do think that there's enough positive, progressive people in America who are into things like the reality of global warming, and the fact that we can pursue alternative fuel sources, that we don't have to drill ourselves out of every possible energy shortage.
[03:18:25.809 --> 03:18:32.734]  And I think that will eventually prevail, because there will be no real way to sustain
[03:18:33.494 --> 03:18:34.395]  These fake wars.
[03:18:34.415 --> 03:18:38.657]  I mean, the war in Iraq, the invasion and occupation of Iraq is quite unsustainable.
[03:18:38.717 --> 03:18:40.097]  There's just not the money or the manpower.
[03:18:40.598 --> 03:18:42.499]  I mean, I don't know where they're going to grow these people.
[03:18:42.519 --> 03:18:47.021]  But that shows the delusional aspect in Vietnam, one terror, World War II, one terror.
[03:18:47.321 --> 03:18:53.764]  There's guys starting their fifth terror, and they're completely, you know, 18 times the record suicides previous, like you said.
[03:18:55.505 --> 03:18:56.786]  It's not just that it's unsustainable.
[03:18:56.826 --> 03:19:01.948]  It seems like the elite have literally... I mean, we had evil elites before, but they were somewhat realist.
[03:19:01.988 --> 03:19:04.710]  It seems there's a delusion or a megalomania.
[03:19:05.290 --> 03:19:09.692]  Yeah, well, I think you have a handful of crazy people.
[03:19:10.693 --> 03:19:12.954]  You know, those who used to get laughed at in D.C.
[03:19:13.134 --> 03:19:15.916]  Like, you know, the eight neoconservatives from back years ago.
[03:19:15.956 --> 03:19:17.136]  People were like, look at those guys.
[03:19:17.176 --> 03:19:18.337]  Look at that guy Wolfowitz.
[03:19:18.397 --> 03:19:20.578]  What a trembling maniac that dude is.
[03:19:21.078 --> 03:19:22.299]  Well, all of those guys
[03:19:22.859 --> 03:19:23.699]  We're good to go.
[03:19:46.747 --> 03:19:48.448]  They have nothing but contempt for the public.
[03:19:48.468 --> 03:19:49.648]  And our name is destroyed!
[03:19:50.208 --> 03:19:57.150]  Our name is destroyed and Karl Rove tells the New York Times, I control reality and we're history's actors and you just watch us.
[03:19:57.170 --> 03:19:58.790]  I mean, they really are power men.
[03:19:59.270 --> 03:20:05.711]  Yeah, and you know, when they say something is true, all of a sudden they just recreate the world to make it true.
[03:20:05.791 --> 03:20:07.652]  And after a while, you forget.
[03:20:08.524 --> 03:20:12.687]  That you spent all day lying to make that thing true, and all of a sudden you're the man.
[03:20:13.328 --> 03:20:16.070]  And I think that's the Kool-Aid these people sip.
[03:20:16.190 --> 03:20:19.493]  I mean, it's an incredible amount of power.
[03:20:19.553 --> 03:20:20.814]  They believe the lie is the truth.
[03:20:20.874 --> 03:20:22.175]  Final segment with Henry Rollins.
[03:20:22.195 --> 03:20:27.259]  We'll see if he can twist his arm, maybe for 5-10 minutes more, but final segment coming up with Henry Rollins.
[03:20:27.499 --> 03:20:27.939]  Stay with us.

[03:21:31.179 --> 03:21:33.701]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:21:34.241 --> 03:21:44.506]  Did you know that the builders of the Twin Towers taken down in the 9-1-1 episode said that the steel would not melt unless there was a sustained temperature of 3,000 degrees?
[03:21:45.206 --> 03:21:50.308]  The immediate impact created temperatures of 2,000 degrees for about 15 to 20 seconds.
[03:21:51.009 --> 03:21:53.630]  Not long enough to even begin the melting process.
[03:21:54.370 --> 03:21:56.733]  The fire continued at about 1,100 degrees.
[03:21:57.193 --> 03:22:00.577]  The fire could not have been the cause for the Twin Towers to collapse.
[03:22:01.398 --> 03:22:09.147]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[03:22:29.722 --> 03:22:36.765]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero, and we knew what to do.
[03:22:37.503 --> 03:22:38.585]  Or at least we thought we did.
[03:22:38.805 --> 03:22:45.156]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[03:22:45.863 --> 03:22:54.407]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[03:22:54.747 --> 03:23:01.550]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:04.871]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[03:23:04.891 --> 03:23:10.654]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:23:10.714 --> 03:23:13.355]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[03:23:13.855 --> 03:23:19.738]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[03:23:19.778 --> 03:23:22.380]  Or order the DVD at Infowars.com.
[03:23:22.840 --> 03:23:27.743]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[03:23:29.059 --> 03:23:33.784]  Don't be a victim of sudden cardiac arrest due to inflammation of the arterial walls.

[03:24:28.593 --> 03:24:35.460]  Alright, final signal to Henry Rollins, but he's agreed to come back on in the future.
[03:24:35.520 --> 03:24:35.680]  Henry?
[03:24:43.742 --> 03:24:47.305]  My point is that you're somebody who loves liberty and freedom and I think you're a good guy.
[03:24:47.325 --> 03:24:49.167]  You're speaking out against censorship of the web.
[03:24:49.447 --> 03:24:51.369]  I'd like you to briefly talk about that before you leave us.
[03:24:51.749 --> 03:24:56.494]  But then you talk about, you know, these hillbillies that want to attack a country but can't find it on a map and they want to
[03:24:57.094 --> 03:25:01.217]  Well, I think you should have a gun in your house if you want to defend your family.
[03:25:01.237 --> 03:25:03.939]  I don't think any family, you or me, needs an assault weapon.
[03:25:03.959 --> 03:25:05.099]  If I was a policeman in your town,
[03:25:22.739 --> 03:25:34.153]  And I know I'm going up against people with bullets that can go through my door, through my body, and through the body of my partner, and I am not given ceramic-plated body armor which stops an AK-47 round.
[03:25:34.594 --> 03:25:37.598]  I've got a real problem with that, and I don't think any citizen
[03:25:38.318 --> 03:25:39.599]  What are you going to shoot with a gun?
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:40.640]  An intruder?
[03:25:41.101 --> 03:25:41.661]  Yourself?
[03:25:41.981 --> 03:25:42.682]  On a bad day?
[03:25:43.142 --> 03:25:44.323]  Or maybe a deer?
[03:25:44.944 --> 03:25:45.204]  Right?
[03:25:45.624 --> 03:25:49.587]  You're not shooting Al Qaeda, so you don't need an AK-47.
[03:25:50.028 --> 03:25:51.669]  A shotgun?
[03:25:51.689 --> 03:25:52.670]  A handgun?
[03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:53.551]  Fantastic!
[03:25:54.211 --> 03:25:55.312]  An assault weapon?
[03:25:55.432 --> 03:25:59.055]  But see, once you let them start restricting, they can restrict it all.
[03:25:59.095 --> 03:26:02.578]  And certainly, you know, throughout history, tyrants have sought to disarm their quarry.
[03:26:03.078 --> 03:26:08.243]  Yeah, and I just don't think you'd ever be able to disarm America.
[03:26:08.763 --> 03:26:16.170]  I just think it can be delicately regulated to where even Charlton Heston's ghost will be satisfied.
[03:26:16.230 --> 03:26:18.191]  I just don't think Americans use assault weapons.
[03:26:18.572 --> 03:26:20.874]  I don't think you'd ever successfully stop abortion.
[03:26:21.594 --> 03:26:24.836]  Or, you know, take the rifle out of anyone's cold, dead hand.
[03:26:24.896 --> 03:26:27.138]  Well, I mean, I see your point there, but here's another issue.
[03:26:27.678 --> 03:26:32.201]  The sun has no spots on it, it's cooling down, the earth goes up and down in temperature.
[03:26:32.361 --> 03:26:42.667]  I have no doubt we need cleaner fuels, that the oil companies are corrupt, but just to then say, well, we need a global tax to stop global warming, I've got a lot of issues with that.
[03:26:43.234 --> 03:26:44.195]  Well, that's interesting.
[03:26:44.235 --> 03:26:51.560]  I mean, when I go on tour now, I pay money to compensate for the carbon footprint my bus leaves.
[03:26:53.067 --> 03:26:58.590]  And so, when I take my tour bus out on the road, I'm doing damage.
[03:26:58.970 --> 03:27:06.753]  And so I compensate for that by, you know, sending money to this outfit my road manager hooked me up with, and we're going to be... Yeah, buying credits.
[03:27:06.793 --> 03:27:11.636]  Well, I mean, the central banks have said they want us to buy carbon credits from them, and it's just a global tax, Henry.
[03:27:11.676 --> 03:27:16.258]  I'm not saying... I know you want to do good and want to reduce the fuel you're using, and I'm all for that.
[03:27:16.278 --> 03:27:17.538]  I just think you're a smart guy.
[03:27:17.578 --> 03:27:18.779]  You might... You know what?
[03:27:19.773 --> 03:27:20.794]  We're going to go to break when it ends.
[03:27:20.854 --> 03:27:22.456]  Let me get an address or a PO Box for me.
[03:27:22.476 --> 03:27:24.498]  I'm going to mail you a film I made called Endgame.
[03:27:25.019 --> 03:27:26.020]  And I know you're a smart guy.
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:28.402]  It has a whole bibliography at whatistheendgame.com.
[03:27:28.782 --> 03:27:32.586]  And I want you to fully look into the larger eugenics operation behind that.
[03:27:32.626 --> 03:27:37.572]  I mean, are you aware that there is a global elite that does want to carry out worldwide population reduction?
[03:27:38.473 --> 03:27:38.693]  Uh, no.
[03:27:40.335 --> 03:27:41.216]  Well, you're a smart guy.
[03:27:41.236 --> 03:27:44.319]  I bet you've come across some of that Malthusian Social Darwin stuff.
[03:27:44.679 --> 03:27:45.599]  Well, yeah.
[03:27:46.780 --> 03:27:49.202]  Malthus said that we're all going to die of starvation.
[03:27:49.803 --> 03:27:54.346]  And the Industrial Revolution momentarily proved him to be wrong.
[03:27:54.947 --> 03:27:57.709]  And now, as soon as you give more people more food, they breed more.
[03:27:58.509 --> 03:28:06.836]  There's a lot going on with food systems in the world, and the unsustainability of soils, and the dangerousness of artificially produced nitrogen.
[03:28:07.676 --> 03:28:19.627]  And the fact that we're breeding these animals so hard and so fast that, you know, they're mutating, and you're eating strange meat, and, you know, your E. coli is going zoonotic more than... Oh, I agree.
[03:28:19.647 --> 03:28:22.070]  I mean, now they make... Clone beef is in the population.
[03:28:22.090 --> 03:28:23.731]  We've got two minutes left with you.
[03:28:24.552 --> 03:28:25.693]  What happened on the airplane?
[03:28:25.713 --> 03:28:28.455]  I mean, you're reading a book, and now reading a book is evil?
[03:28:29.657 --> 03:28:44.256]  I was reading Jihad by Ahmed Rashid and the man sitting next to me called me in to Homeland Security and I was deemed a person of interest for reading a New York Times bestseller put out by the Yale University Press.
[03:28:46.538 --> 03:28:48.160]  It's an interesting time we're living in.
[03:28:48.180 --> 03:28:51.904]  I just bought that guy's new book too, Descent Into Chaos I think it's called.
[03:28:52.264 --> 03:28:53.125]  I've not yet read it.
[03:28:53.185 --> 03:28:54.727]  I just got it in the mail.
[03:28:54.787 --> 03:28:55.588]  I'm looking forward to it.
[03:28:55.608 --> 03:28:57.050]  He's a very astute writer.
[03:28:57.150 --> 03:29:00.033]  Give us a one minute rant on how they're trying to shut down the free web.
[03:29:01.059 --> 03:29:05.541]  Well, I think they're trying to regulate web speeds and accessibility.
[03:29:06.162 --> 03:29:16.647]  I think the short of it is that the man is afraid of you having access to information, lest you start questioning his actions or maybe learning history so you're doomed not to repeat it.
[03:29:17.187 --> 03:29:21.389]  And so I think that the net is wildly informative and they don't want that.
[03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:26.352]  They want you to believe the bumper sticker like Boycott France or anything that comes from the mouth of Rover.
[03:29:26.972 --> 03:29:28.654]  Or, you know, any of these Fox bastards.
[03:29:29.074 --> 03:29:31.576]  And so it's just too much freedom for them to deal with.
[03:29:32.097 --> 03:29:36.741]  Well, I agree, and I've seen some of the rants you've done where you break down the internet, too, and how they're trying to regulate.
[03:29:36.761 --> 03:29:37.962]  I mean, what's the answer?
[03:29:38.002 --> 03:29:38.703]  Just expose it?
[03:29:38.743 --> 03:29:39.524]  Fight back against it?
[03:29:39.984 --> 03:29:42.346]  Well, you fight back as best you can as a citizen.
[03:29:42.827 --> 03:29:47.391]  But, you know, I wonder what can really be done when the hammer comes down on all of that.
[03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:51.512]  I mean, it's damn infuriating.
[03:29:51.632 --> 03:29:58.998]  You know, the beauty of web neutrality is the rich, the poor, you know, the hippie, the gay, everyone has access to information.
[03:29:59.078 --> 03:30:00.119]  Jefferson would have loved this.
[03:30:00.880 --> 03:30:01.460]  Absolutely.
[03:30:01.720 --> 03:30:03.962]  HenryRollins.com, on tour in the U.S.
[03:30:04.062 --> 03:30:04.743]  and worldwide.
[03:30:04.763 --> 03:30:06.844]  Check it out there for when he's coming to your corner of the woods.
[03:30:07.224 --> 03:30:08.926]  He goes everywhere, unless it's Antarctic.
[03:30:09.686 --> 03:30:13.289]  Henry, let me say bye to you here in this break, and that's it for Henry Rollins.
[03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:14.930]  We appreciate him joining us.
[03:30:14.970 --> 03:30:15.431]  Stay with us.
[03:30:20.798 --> 03:30:23.801]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:30:24.722 --> 03:30:27.405]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:31.474 --> 03:30:34.416]  Fuel prices are up and down, biting into everyone's budget.
[03:30:34.876 --> 03:30:38.399]  If you're ready to start saving at the pump, Fuel Saver technologies can help.

[03:31:27.628 --> 03:31:29.770]  Spend a little and save a lot!
[03:31:30.671 --> 03:31:37.096]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:31:37.416 --> 03:31:39.118]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:31:40.058 --> 03:31:41.119]  But who is the enemy?
[03:31:41.599 --> 03:31:42.159]  Bin Laden.
[03:31:42.399 --> 03:31:43.300]  This is his ammo.
[03:31:43.320 --> 03:31:44.760]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:31:44.780 --> 03:31:46.461]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:31:46.761 --> 03:31:53.504]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:31:53.904 --> 03:31:54.364]  Some U.S.
[03:31:54.404 --> 03:32:00.027]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:32:00.747 --> 03:32:04.229]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:32:04.249 --> 03:32:07.050]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[03:32:30.712 --> 03:32:34.973]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[03:32:35.213 --> 03:32:40.255]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:32:40.315 --> 03:32:41.735]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:32:41.755 --> 03:32:45.337]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[03:32:45.437 --> 03:32:50.578]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[03:32:56.960 --> 03:32:59.422]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[03:33:08.148 --> 03:33:09.749]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[03:33:10.050 --> 03:33:11.151]  And I say big time.
[03:33:11.451 --> 03:33:12.852]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[03:33:12.872 --> 03:33:13.172]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[03:33:30.865 --> 03:33:36.649]  This always happens.
[03:33:36.809 --> 03:33:43.054]  During the break, I went to Rollins, and he said, oh yeah, I'd love to come back on for a full hour in the near future to set it up.
[03:33:43.074 --> 03:33:45.856]  So we're going to set him up in November for a full hour.
[03:33:45.876 --> 03:33:48.278]  And I said, yeah, I want to mail you some of my films.
[03:33:48.298 --> 03:33:48.918]  Give me your address.
[03:33:48.938 --> 03:33:50.700]  He goes, well, there's really no need of that, Alex.
[03:33:51.260 --> 03:33:52.161]  I buy your films.
[03:33:53.092 --> 03:33:55.173]  He goes, yeah, my favorite's Terror Storm.
[03:33:58.694 --> 03:34:08.717]  He goes, yeah, I've seen the first Terror Storm, then I got some of your other videos, and then a girlfriend of mine, a friend of mine in Austin gave me the second edition, and I really like that one.
[03:34:09.957 --> 03:34:19.660]  And the phone was ringing, he had to go to another radio interview, so next time we get Rollins on, we'll get a plug, an endorsement of my videos from him on air.
[03:34:20.021 --> 03:34:21.341]  How many people have we reached?
[03:34:21.943 --> 03:34:23.204]  It's all because of you, the listeners.
[03:34:23.764 --> 03:34:24.964]  Hey, hey, Aaron, come on in here.
[03:34:25.404 --> 03:34:26.885]  You don't know why you're being called in here.
[03:34:26.905 --> 03:34:29.086]  Aaron, it's just incredible.
[03:34:29.886 --> 03:34:31.727]  Why don't you pull up a chair here real fast?
[03:34:31.767 --> 03:34:33.867]  I've got some audio clips I want to play and a bunch of other stuff.
[03:34:34.347 --> 03:34:35.668]  You don't know why I'm dragging you in here.
[03:34:36.448 --> 03:34:41.250]  But I want to recognize you, specifically, as the hardest working person in this office.
[03:34:42.527 --> 03:34:43.788]  Uh, no, no, no, not today.
[03:34:44.488 --> 03:34:45.009]  All the time.
[03:34:45.289 --> 03:34:46.690]  And then there's Rob works hard.
[03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:47.630]  Everybody works hard.
[03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:48.531]  I mean, Trey works hard.
[03:34:49.011 --> 03:34:53.194]  But, you know, down that line, uh, the people at this office particularly, we have two offices.
[03:34:53.214 --> 03:34:54.154]  We're about to get rid of this one.
[03:34:54.574 --> 03:34:55.975]  But we're building the other studio, the TV studio.
[03:34:56.015 --> 03:34:57.096]  I've never seen Paul and Kurt.
[03:34:57.136 --> 03:34:58.597]  I'm pretty sure they work pretty hard, too.
[03:34:58.737 --> 03:34:59.237]  No, I don't know.
[03:34:59.277 --> 03:35:00.238]  They work really hard on the web.
[03:35:00.258 --> 03:35:02.299]  But, well, I know Paul and Kurt, and they work hard, too.
[03:35:02.319 --> 03:35:07.262]  I mean, Kurt just had a bunch of dentist work, not much dentistry done, and he's still working.
[03:35:07.923 --> 03:35:09.904]  Uh, but, I mean, you, you were here at 9 a.m.
[03:35:09.924 --> 03:35:10.224]  yesterday?
[03:35:11.218 --> 03:35:12.580]  Yeah, well, ten maybe.
[03:35:24.536 --> 03:35:27.518]  27 hours later, why don't you tell the listeners why you're so excited?
[03:35:27.578 --> 03:35:29.660]  Because I told you to take all week if you needed this.
[03:35:29.680 --> 03:35:36.265]  I mean, you told me earlier, once you started your investigation, you're literally like an old detective on the trail of the bad guys.
[03:35:36.285 --> 03:35:36.665]  Tell folks.
[03:35:36.805 --> 03:35:38.226]  Well, Denver was so exciting.
[03:35:38.927 --> 03:35:42.850]  It's infuriating that we have all these great tapes and they just go stale.
[03:35:42.890 --> 03:35:44.311]  So you're like, get them up, get them up, get them up.
[03:35:44.791 --> 03:35:47.674]  And all the cool people we met and all the interesting things they said.
[03:35:47.694 --> 03:35:57.223]  And then on top of it, this whole Malkin incident and how they just lie and say that you said things like, kill Michelle Malkin, which is utterly ridiculous, completely untrue.
[03:35:57.623 --> 03:35:59.925]  And we proved it now with angle after angle.
[03:36:00.466 --> 03:36:04.710]  And Malkin with her internment camps, I couldn't believe how many times I've said that.
[03:36:04.730 --> 03:36:05.931]  And we've got them touching me first.
[03:36:06.804 --> 03:36:10.946]  Uh, we've got them elbowing me first, and then I do it back, but that's okay for them to elbow and push me.
[03:36:11.006 --> 03:36:12.807]  I just can't do it back, because I did it harder.
[03:36:12.827 --> 03:36:13.487]  I said, don't touch me.
[03:36:13.527 --> 03:36:14.027]  Okay, that's it.
[03:36:14.067 --> 03:36:14.648]  I'm going to push you.
[03:36:14.668 --> 03:36:16.088]  Uh, you know, you're an elbow.
[03:36:16.108 --> 03:36:17.129]  I'm going to elbow you right back.
[03:36:17.809 --> 03:36:19.650]  Uh, but, but, you know, it's, the hoax is still going.
[03:36:19.830 --> 03:36:21.111]  I, I thought we dissipated it.
[03:36:21.171 --> 03:36:23.812]  I mean, people are calling stations, calling sponsors.
[03:36:23.852 --> 03:36:25.553]  Why did I say murder her?
[03:36:25.653 --> 03:36:26.813]  Why, why did I punch her?
[03:36:26.853 --> 03:36:28.014]  Why did I knock her teeth out?
[03:36:28.274 --> 03:36:31.396]  It's kind of like that telephone game where it's that I beat her.
[03:36:31.456 --> 03:36:32.436]  I knocked her teeth out.
[03:36:32.656 --> 03:36:34.377]  I, I, I mean, it's out there now.
[03:36:34.677 --> 03:36:35.197]  I think so, yeah.
[03:37:00.752 --> 03:37:03.232]  Well, you know, we watched some over there, some we got back.
[03:37:03.553 --> 03:37:08.093]  I wasn't thinking I should put these videos up first, and I thought, oh my God, I've got to defend myself from Malkin.
[03:37:08.433 --> 03:37:10.094]  It's like I'm under an inquisition or something.
[03:37:10.134 --> 03:37:12.894]  So you've been on that the last 27, 26 hours.
[03:37:13.214 --> 03:37:14.134]  Tell folks what you found.
[03:37:15.255 --> 03:37:18.955]  Well, you know, first of all, it's a crowd situation, so it's always going to be exciting.
[03:37:19.015 --> 03:37:22.496]  Everyone's, you know, all up in energy from all sides.
[03:37:22.576 --> 03:37:25.676]  The anarchists... Oh, we got attacked at all the other events, hit and punched.
[03:37:25.716 --> 03:37:27.237]  I mean, we were well-behaved compared to the other people.
[03:37:27.777 --> 03:37:29.917]  I mean, old ladies turn into demons at these events.
[03:37:30.017 --> 03:37:36.403]  So, see, the real hoax isn't, you know, who shoved first or who shouted, killed Michelle Malkin, because we know that.
[03:37:36.443 --> 03:37:37.444]  It's a guy in a green shirt.
[03:37:37.765 --> 03:37:41.088]  We don't know his name, but we can see him from multiple video angles.
[03:37:41.468 --> 03:37:52.640]  The real hoax is that Michelle Malkin is supposed to be this cute little woman, and, you know, she's always preaching not to go off of, you know, diversity and not to judge
[03:37:53.320 --> 03:37:55.021]  You know, based on race and stuff.
[03:37:55.541 --> 03:38:07.428]  Well, this crowd is going off the fact she's a woman, yet she's pitching these horrible ideas of internment camp, defending murder of puppies, when nobody cares about dead Iraqi children, dead Iraqi adults.
[03:38:08.047 --> 03:38:11.689]  She's saying FEMA camps are good, torture's good, makes jokes about it.
[03:38:12.049 --> 03:38:19.432]  And that's not just something you shouted at her in the crowd, as though free speech wasn't your right, as though you're not supposed to confront horrible, monstrous ideas.
[03:38:19.933 --> 03:38:30.337]  But on YouTube, there's just endless clips, hours and hours of her pitching her book, The Case for Internment, and paralleling it with the Japanese internment.
[03:38:30.357 --> 03:38:33.639]  And now arresting whole groups of Americans, whole races, whole religions.
[03:38:34.239 --> 03:38:40.524]  Criticize the government, go to a camp, and then I'm not supposed to say, I don't like you pushing me to go in a camp when it's clearly a talking point?
[03:38:40.604 --> 03:38:41.824]  Alex, didn't you read the book?
[03:38:41.845 --> 03:38:45.167]  You don't just profile on religion, you also profile on race.
[03:38:45.727 --> 03:38:46.488]  And on nationality.
[03:38:46.528 --> 03:38:47.448]  And on their statements.
[03:38:47.689 --> 03:38:49.630]  You don't agree with the government, you go to a camp, yeah.
[03:38:50.279 --> 03:38:51.100]  How dare I?
[03:38:51.420 --> 03:38:54.501]  Imagine the Founding Fathers, if they would have, the Sons of Liberty.
[03:38:54.762 --> 03:38:59.304]  They'd have seen somebody running around publishing books about, lock up anyone that criticizes the Crown.
[03:38:59.344 --> 03:39:02.226]  Well, that's actually what happened, and they would actually lynch you.
[03:39:02.326 --> 03:39:03.186]  Now, we didn't do that.
[03:39:03.567 --> 03:39:04.467]  We're not calling for that.
[03:39:04.747 --> 03:39:06.788]  But this is how gilded even our own movement is.
[03:39:07.069 --> 03:39:10.130]  He yelled at us, oh my God!
[03:39:11.011 --> 03:39:13.552]  They always want to call you Alex Jones Extreme.
[03:39:14.033 --> 03:39:14.473]  We have
[03:39:15.263 --> 03:39:22.289]  Geraldo Rivera from Fox News, the same network she's on, saying he loved to spit on her, and he's glad he's not in the same city.
[03:39:22.409 --> 03:39:28.514]  And by the way, he ended up getting her basically kicked off O'Reilly as the co-host, and then he almost got fired, but he survived that.
[03:39:28.675 --> 03:39:33.579]  Yeah, and Rivero, you know, good or bad, he's not the best, but he was doing it for the right reasons.
[03:39:33.599 --> 03:39:37.062]  I mean, he recognizes when somebody says, put every Muslim in a camp, it's over.
[03:39:37.322 --> 03:39:38.483]  I commend Rivero for that.
[03:39:39.446 --> 03:39:41.349]  I mean, he's allowed to say she's disgusting.
[03:39:41.769 --> 03:39:42.490]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:39:42.730 --> 03:39:43.551]  She is disgusting.
[03:39:43.571 --> 03:39:44.432]  They want to attack you.
[03:39:44.473 --> 03:39:46.595]  He said more extreme things, and should have.
[03:39:46.635 --> 03:39:47.676]  Those are horrible ideas.
[03:39:47.717 --> 03:39:48.798]  They have to be fought against.
[03:39:48.918 --> 03:39:49.459]  Yeah, folks.
[03:39:49.539 --> 03:39:50.941]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[03:39:50.961 --> 03:39:52.983]  You start saying arrest people and their families.
[03:39:53.043 --> 03:39:54.425]  I mean, those are fighting words.
[03:39:55.186 --> 03:39:56.848]  Michelle Malkin's lucky she didn't get more.
[03:39:57.583 --> 03:39:59.544]  And, uh, but the bottom line is we have the video.
[03:39:59.624 --> 03:40:00.984]  I came up nicely at first, actually.
[03:40:01.004 --> 03:40:04.945]  I was, you know, crowds yelling, but I'm like, hey, you should put Americans in camps for their views.
[03:40:04.965 --> 03:40:12.267]  You know, you said I lied about that puppy and his guy comes up, gets right in my face, starts bumping into me, saying, I'm big, I'm big.
[03:40:12.827 --> 03:40:16.368]  And then grabbed our camera and like wrenched the, broke the microphone.
[03:40:16.628 --> 03:40:22.089]  Incidentally, he was wearing a National Security Agency, uh, lanyard, like it's cute or something.
[03:40:22.629 --> 03:40:27.050]  Found videos of Malkin going on tours with the NSA and stuff like that.
[03:40:27.070 --> 03:40:27.490]  Well, wait a minute.
[03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:29.370]  You know who the main sponsors of those websites are.
[03:40:29.611 --> 03:40:30.491]  The top sponsor.
[03:40:30.511 --> 03:40:33.631]  It isn't some Google ad, too, where you'll see a McCain ad or a Barack Obama ad.
[03:40:33.691 --> 03:40:34.652]  It's Homeland Security.
[03:40:34.712 --> 03:40:35.892]  And then we've got to erase it.
[03:40:36.112 --> 03:40:39.953]  Yeah, because when I first saw it on her site a year ago, I looked and said, that's not a Google ad.
[03:40:40.573 --> 03:40:42.053]  If you click it, it'll tell you if it's a Google ad.
[03:40:42.713 --> 03:40:45.174]  She has an actual sponsor, Homeland Security.
[03:40:45.694 --> 03:40:46.214]  Yeah, that's true.
[03:40:47.139 --> 03:40:52.401]  Because the Homeland Security's built camps, and it's part of their program to condition the public to accept going to camps.
[03:40:53.061 --> 03:40:54.902]  And she loves, uh, warrantless spying.
[03:40:55.862 --> 03:40:57.363]  So she gets tours of the NSA.
[03:40:58.043 --> 03:40:58.603]  Yeah, basically.
[03:40:58.683 --> 03:40:59.944]  I mean, this woman is wicked!
[03:41:01.124 --> 03:41:02.665]  But, oh, I was mean to her.
[03:41:02.685 --> 03:41:04.725]  There's actually a museum for the NSA, but still.
[03:41:05.886 --> 03:41:07.106]  Oh, geez, we're in trouble.
[03:41:07.146 --> 03:41:08.947]  So, so, so, tell us what we'll see on this video.
[03:41:10.030 --> 03:41:18.233]  Uh, well, we did our best to compile all our video angles as well as some of the YouTube angles, uh, so you can really see what's going on, who's shouting what.
[03:41:18.793 --> 03:41:25.535]  Uh, you can see Alex comes up, you know, he's, he's, uh, challenging her ideas, but he's using an even tone.
[03:41:25.755 --> 03:41:27.015]  And I'm about five feet back.
[03:41:27.095 --> 03:41:28.576]  I also didn't even get in her space.
[03:41:29.216 --> 03:41:31.277]  Because I don't get in people's space when I'm arguing with them.
[03:41:31.597 --> 03:41:35.059]  Yeah, and you know, the thing about editing is you watch these moments, moment by moment.
[03:41:35.459 --> 03:41:44.743]  And the moment she decides to walk away and end the friendly conversations, when you call out Cheney and his terror thing, Cheney's, uh, government-sponsored terror.
[03:41:44.763 --> 03:41:49.085]  Yeah, I bring up, it just came out that Cheney wanted to stage terror, and it was like I'd shown a cross to a vampire.
[03:41:49.105 --> 03:41:50.786]  I notice nobody wants to talk about that.
[03:41:50.906 --> 03:41:52.807]  Oh, they don't want to talk about that, no.
[03:41:52.827 --> 03:41:55.548]  9-11 Truth is, uh, you know, it's cuckoo stuff, but
[03:41:56.491 --> 03:42:03.003]  You know, Cheney having meetings about shooting Navy SEALs to start a war with Iran, that's, you know...
[03:42:03.695 --> 03:42:04.695]  Nobody can talk about that.
[03:42:04.735 --> 03:42:05.355]  That's admitted.
[03:42:05.555 --> 03:42:06.435]  That's public.
[03:42:06.676 --> 03:42:08.396]  We don't want to talk about the admitted examples.
[03:42:08.436 --> 03:42:09.296]  Yeah.
[03:42:09.516 --> 03:42:11.156]  Yeah, let's just isolate Cy Hirsch.
[03:42:11.216 --> 03:42:12.116]  Never talk about it.
[03:42:12.577 --> 03:42:13.697]  Never talk about Olbermann.
[03:42:13.717 --> 03:42:15.057]  Let's not talk about that.
[03:42:15.417 --> 03:42:20.058]  Oh yeah, I mean the minute I said her face went ashen, the color went out of it.
[03:42:20.098 --> 03:42:20.618]  You can watch it.
[03:42:20.638 --> 03:42:25.319]  She puts her chin up, closes her eyes like it was mind control, and turns.
[03:42:25.479 --> 03:42:27.139]  That was actually the moment she leaves.
[03:42:27.179 --> 03:42:32.320]  That's also the moment that Mr. Pajamas steps up and starts becoming the bodyguard.
[03:42:33.012 --> 03:42:36.815]  I found out that they had never met before, but they have, you know, friendly blogs.
[03:42:37.696 --> 03:42:43.760]  Yeah, there was a whole constellation, or pilot fish, following the, you know, the main wart.
[03:42:44.621 --> 03:42:55.048]  And then you had some local blogs who were affiliated with the guys dressed up like jesters who ran up, hey, we're with Alex Jones, and later are yelling, F Alex Jones, and then are friends with Malcolm's people.
[03:42:55.068 --> 03:42:56.770]  What's the whole canard of, was it a...
[03:42:57.799 --> 03:43:01.682]  A thought-out stage conspiracy of six people or nine people.
[03:43:02.363 --> 03:43:03.784]  I don't think any of this was planned.
[03:43:03.844 --> 03:43:06.666]  It's just that they're disingenuous, won't take free speech.
[03:43:06.686 --> 03:43:10.729]  Well, it was her supporters, and they did stand over me screaming, Mr. Kilmichael Malcolm.
[03:43:11.009 --> 03:43:11.529]  Sure, yeah.
[03:43:11.569 --> 03:43:12.770]  That looked like training to me.
[03:43:13.971 --> 03:43:15.212]  It may well have been, you know.
[03:43:15.312 --> 03:43:19.155]  We don't have that proof in the video, but the point is they won't stand up for free speech.
[03:43:19.195 --> 03:43:20.376]  They won't defend those ideas.
[03:43:20.636 --> 03:43:21.617]  And they're really against me.
[03:43:22.358 --> 03:43:22.518]  Yeah.
[03:43:22.678 --> 03:43:28.780]  So, so that's the point is that, is he, first I said kill Michelle Malkin, now I've proven I didn't say it, but now it will prove they're not with you.
[03:43:29.620 --> 03:43:30.000]  That's right.
[03:43:30.920 --> 03:43:39.163]  Yeah, first it's Alex Jones is your buddy, then it's kill Michelle Malkin, then it's Alex Jones is a corporate stooge, then it's F Alex Jones.
[03:43:40.063 --> 03:43:44.604]  I mean, these guys are... And then as they walked off, they went, F you, we punked you, we got you.
[03:43:44.924 --> 03:43:46.344]  Who is this guy in the green shirt?
[03:43:46.384 --> 03:43:48.085]  That's the missing... I still don't know.
[03:43:49.242 --> 03:44:17.968]  uh... i was told by some of the other locals that they are allied neocon bloggers uh... who are allied with little green footballs looking at the left pajamas media and certainly that's true of the photographer he goes by the name uh... and he's the guy who sees them say killer he goes to cops and says Alex Jones is saying and he was following us again the next day looking at the left dot com yeah because he has when we were photographing him running to the police he has pictures of us running after him and
[03:44:18.510 --> 03:44:21.776]  We were just trying to find out why he's following us and why he's telling lies.
[03:44:22.137 --> 03:44:23.199]  Trying to set up to the police.
[03:44:23.239 --> 03:44:29.269]  We have on tape another 9-11 truther filmed him setting up Alex Jones to the police.
[03:44:29.330 --> 03:44:31.614]  Look, they got Homeland Security as their sponsor.
[03:44:32.662 --> 03:44:33.963]  They're going for broke.
[03:44:33.983 --> 03:44:37.025]  They're on TV saying, put political dissenters in camps.
[03:44:37.625 --> 03:44:39.126]  These are hardcore people.
[03:44:39.427 --> 03:44:43.910]  They thought they were gonna go and make fun of a leftist protest that really stood for nothing.
[03:44:43.930 --> 03:44:50.414]  But see, it turns out, the day before, it looks like it's the same green shirt guys, but in different shirts, starting the F.U.
[03:44:50.514 --> 03:44:55.077]  Fox they put on TV, and then Malcolm reported she'd been attacked before, and then they screamed, kill, kill.
[03:44:55.358 --> 03:44:55.858]  So it looks like
[03:44:56.886 --> 03:45:02.691]  Whether she knows it, she's got protectors that go around with her screaming, kill, kill, so they can then say that in a meeting.
[03:45:03.311 --> 03:45:06.995]  Yeah, just stage provocations as a way of life, basically.
[03:45:07.115 --> 03:45:08.376]  And these guys are wearing disguises.
[03:45:08.416 --> 03:45:09.717]  Big sunglasses, hats.
[03:45:10.658 --> 03:45:16.142]  Well, they're meant to look like court gestures to marginalize whoever Michelle Malkin is against that hour.
[03:45:16.903 --> 03:45:17.123]  Yeah.
[03:45:17.503 --> 03:45:19.945]  Just in case you challenge anything she's ever said.
[03:45:20.286 --> 03:45:21.987]  This is a black op, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:45:22.007 --> 03:45:24.069]  They're directly sponsored by Homeland Security.
[03:45:24.764 --> 03:45:26.806]  And I just want to say shame on you, Homeland Security.
[03:45:27.207 --> 03:45:29.028]  You've been further discredited, CENTCOM.
[03:45:29.048 --> 03:45:30.109]  You've been further discredited.
[03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:31.010]  I'm not kidding.
[03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:33.473]  We need to get screenshots of the fact that they're sponsored by Homeland Security.
[03:45:33.493 --> 03:45:34.053]  Have you seen that?
[03:45:34.254 --> 03:45:35.114]  Yeah, I have seen that.
[03:45:35.174 --> 03:45:36.175]  I mean, officially!
[03:45:36.636 --> 03:45:36.816]  Yeah.
[03:45:37.337 --> 03:45:38.898]  I mean, they're not... This is U.S.
[03:45:38.938 --> 03:45:40.220]  government going up against me!
[03:45:40.580 --> 03:45:42.602]  Framing me for saying, kill a woman and beating her!
[03:45:45.094 --> 03:45:45.775]  It's outrageous.
[03:45:46.155 --> 03:45:47.856]  God, I wish I would have known they were setting me up at the time.
[03:45:47.876 --> 03:45:48.717]  I could have really burned them.
[03:45:49.117 --> 03:45:49.497]  Doesn't matter.
[03:45:49.517 --> 03:45:50.198]  We're still winning.
[03:45:50.398 --> 03:45:52.159]  It's about a 60-40 split right now.
[03:45:52.600 --> 03:45:54.101]  But it's up to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:45:54.201 --> 03:45:58.905]  Will you get the video and send it to every neocon?
[03:45:58.925 --> 03:46:05.670]  By the way, when people start calling WBAP about this Mark Davis, he is still going on air saying, I edited video and then I did say killer.
[03:46:06.290 --> 03:46:08.412]  And folks, I do not want to spend your money showing them.
[03:46:08.432 --> 03:46:12.615]  I want to make new TV shows, radio shows, get big guests for you, break news.
[03:46:15.342 --> 03:46:17.284]  It's easy to sound tough and say, I'll sue, I'll sue.
[03:46:17.344 --> 03:46:19.045]  I mean, I've sued people four times and won every time.
[03:46:20.566 --> 03:46:21.347]  I don't enjoy it.
[03:46:21.447 --> 03:46:22.188]  It's not fun.
[03:46:22.208 --> 03:46:25.510]  I mean, Martin Davis, my wife, sent an email saying, please retract.
[03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:26.351]  My husband didn't say that.
[03:46:26.371 --> 03:46:27.752]  He's like, you dumb woman.
[03:46:27.772 --> 03:46:29.514]  Your husband's a piece of trash.
[03:46:29.834 --> 03:46:31.675]  You deserve it better than you.
[03:46:31.715 --> 03:46:32.556]  We ought to publish that.
[03:46:33.016 --> 03:46:35.238]  I mean, this is just trashy, evil people, folks.
[03:46:35.298 --> 03:46:40.683]  And they're so used to an audience they can lie to and deceive and just get away with all of it.
[03:46:40.703 --> 03:46:44.866]  They lay revel in how stupid the general public is, Aaron.
[03:46:45.968 --> 03:46:46.588]  I don't know.
[03:47:05.385 --> 03:47:07.568]  The next few days if you get some rest, we'll do a part two.
[03:47:07.588 --> 03:47:09.169]  There's so much you couldn't put it all in ten minutes.
[03:47:09.189 --> 03:47:11.572]  We want to keep it down to one bite of ten minutes.
[03:47:12.513 --> 03:47:14.115]  But there's a bunch of stuff going up for members.
[03:47:14.415 --> 03:47:22.444]  The Tom Morello interview, the interview with Jerome Corsi, really powerful stuff at the DNC, Cindy Sheehan.
[03:47:24.125 --> 03:47:26.587]  A bunch of other exclusives for Prison Planet.
[03:47:27.087 --> 03:47:29.549]  TV members, don't forget the new film Fabled Enemies is out.
[03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:39.157]  And I've noticed since we crossed this line with Fabled Enemies, to really criticize the intelligence agencies that were involved, I'm noticing the heat is just, it's like somebody flipped a switch.
[03:47:40.478 --> 03:47:43.140]  Well, all these bloggers seem to work for the same people as well.
[03:47:43.820 --> 03:47:46.522]  Yeah, well, it's not going to work, folks.
[03:47:46.643 --> 03:47:48.204]  Every time we get attacked, we only get bigger.
[03:47:49.254 --> 03:47:50.275]  And I trust in God.
[03:47:50.775 --> 03:47:51.835]  I do believe in the Creator.
[03:47:51.855 --> 03:47:56.837]  I do believe in the, you know, energy, spirit of the universe, whatever you want to call it, good versus evil.
[03:47:57.458 --> 03:48:05.301]  And the good, the, you know, the force of creation, God is a lot better than the evil force, a lot bigger and a lot more powerful.
[03:48:06.061 --> 03:48:07.602]  And we just put it all in God's hands.
[03:48:07.662 --> 03:48:09.823]  But we have gotten death threats.
[03:48:10.043 --> 03:48:11.804]  You know, how dare you threaten to kill that woman?
[03:48:11.844 --> 03:48:12.684]  I'm going to kill you.
[03:48:13.124 --> 03:48:14.805]  This is the type of self-righteous stuff.
[03:48:14.845 --> 03:48:17.126]  They like to feed the mentally ill stalker types.
[03:48:18.211 --> 03:48:21.632]  Yeah, but see, about the Malcolm thing, I think people are going after the wrong argument.
[03:48:21.672 --> 03:48:26.253]  They're arguing over, did you yell fire in a theater or were you too loud at the wrong moment?
[03:48:27.094 --> 03:48:32.075]  The point is, they're coming after you when you were challenging her on the internment camps.
[03:48:32.435 --> 03:48:33.876]  And she has nothing to say about it.
[03:48:34.136 --> 03:48:35.376]  It's never about internment camps.
[03:48:35.396 --> 03:48:37.977]  It's never about lying and saying, I lied about the puppy.
[03:48:38.117 --> 03:48:41.718]  And every video online, even Chris Matthews, it's, did you read my book?
[03:48:42.238 --> 03:48:44.359]  How about, what are these ideas you're pitching?
[03:48:44.399 --> 03:48:45.079]  How dare you?
[03:48:46.218 --> 03:48:47.759]  Yeah, well, and then we did read her book.
[03:48:47.779 --> 03:48:49.580]  I mean, she came out with it, like, three years ago.
[03:48:49.600 --> 03:48:53.543]  They sent me a copy that we called their publicist, and I actually read the thing and read quotes on it.
[03:48:53.563 --> 03:48:54.343]  We had a big guy interview us.
[03:48:54.363 --> 03:49:00.507]  Those people who went up to her at C-SPAN, you know, the TV channel, and said, how dare you write this?
[03:49:00.567 --> 03:49:02.088]  And she said, you didn't read my book.
[03:49:02.128 --> 03:49:03.449]  I'm not going to say anything to you.
[03:49:03.869 --> 03:49:09.032]  That's a condescending... Like, if you read it, you would be for putting people without trials in prison camps.
[03:49:09.713 --> 03:49:13.555]  I mean, maybe she has an asterisk in there, but I mean, it's all on the cover there.
[03:49:14.711 --> 03:49:17.012]  Well, actually, I probably read 100 pages.
[03:49:17.032 --> 03:49:17.812]  I didn't read the whole thing.
[03:49:17.852 --> 03:49:19.373]  It was so horrible, I couldn't read it anymore.
[03:49:20.033 --> 03:49:24.295]  It was how wonderful it is to put all the Japanese in the camps, how it kept them safe, and how they loved it.
[03:49:24.495 --> 03:49:25.816]  And how it relates to post-9-11.
[03:49:26.016 --> 03:49:28.317]  And how the Japanese thanked them for putting them in camps.
[03:49:28.337 --> 03:49:30.678]  They're having their land and their fishing boats stolen.
[03:49:30.718 --> 03:49:31.378]  No, they don't.
[03:49:31.398 --> 03:49:31.958]  I've talked to them.
[03:49:32.578 --> 03:49:34.559]  It's just, it's total bull.
[03:49:34.619 --> 03:49:36.740]  It's not an intellectual graduate paper.
[03:49:36.820 --> 03:49:38.961]  It's a criminal hoax on the people.
[03:49:40.436 --> 03:49:46.299]  Well, the video, for those out there, it is Kill Michelle Malkin Hoax Exposed.
[03:49:46.819 --> 03:49:50.822]  I need your help getting this video out to everyone because this is definitive.
[03:49:50.862 --> 03:49:51.922]  This goes through all of it.
[03:49:52.302 --> 03:49:53.603]  This shows you what's happening.
[03:49:53.643 --> 03:49:54.363]  It details it.
[03:49:55.684 --> 03:49:59.866]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[03:49:59.906 --> 03:50:00.827]  But the good news is
[03:50:01.673 --> 03:50:11.480]  Liberal, conservative, libertarian, every big wig I talk to, former German defense ministers, former Italian presidents, members of the Japanese government, Hollywood people.
[03:50:12.101 --> 03:50:14.062]  It doesn't matter who it is I run into.
[03:50:14.102 --> 03:50:28.173]  Rage Against the Machine, you know, mainline neighbors down the street, people at church, they all know the government's criminal and out of control, and the lies and fraud you've been selling aren't working anymore.
[03:50:29.614 --> 03:50:30.975]  By the way, this video also gets into
[03:50:33.163 --> 03:50:33.864]  Her past statements.
[03:50:33.884 --> 03:50:34.924]  She's always saying, did you read my book?
[03:50:34.944 --> 03:50:35.404]  Did you read my book?
[03:50:35.705 --> 03:50:37.626]  We have her verbally saying what she believes.
[03:50:38.186 --> 03:50:41.748]  Yeah, on Fox, on C-SPAN, on CNN.
[03:50:41.769 --> 03:50:43.490]  There's a few others too, I think.
[03:50:44.070 --> 03:50:45.051]  Just over and over.
[03:50:45.451 --> 03:50:45.891]  Same thing.
[03:50:46.091 --> 03:50:46.532]  Over and over.
[03:50:47.672 --> 03:50:48.613]  The case for internment.
[03:50:48.773 --> 03:50:50.054]  Let's have internment.
[03:50:50.194 --> 03:50:55.297]  I mean, I normally don't judge a book by its cover, but didn't she just seem troll-like and demon-like and hateful?
[03:50:55.957 --> 03:50:57.779]  I mean, she was a really disgusting person.
[03:50:58.339 --> 03:50:59.740]  And she had a certain look on her face.
[03:51:01.002 --> 03:51:09.784]  And I mean, she thought that arrogant hate of us and dismissing us like we were just grovel and quail, like shrinking violets, you know, at her not liking us.
[03:51:09.804 --> 03:51:11.085]  Hey, we don't care, witch.
[03:51:11.605 --> 03:51:14.266]  We don't care what you and your punk Homeland Security employees do.
[03:51:14.286 --> 03:51:21.468]  We're gonna expose you, we're gonna discredit you, because you need to be exposed and discredited for the monster pig you are.
[03:51:21.488 --> 03:51:23.068]  That video's up there.
[03:51:23.088 --> 03:51:25.789]  I want all of you to get it and rhyme it down everybody's throats.
[03:51:25.829 --> 03:51:27.369]  Help us get it out before it wins.
[03:51:27.409 --> 03:51:29.290]  Now, Attack Pattern Delta.
[03:51:30.550 --> 03:51:35.136]  Phase one of the insider's plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[03:51:35.456 --> 03:51:42.664]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[03:51:42.904 --> 03:51:44.346]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[03:51:44.546 --> 03:51:45.247]  Their next engineer
[03:51:45.267 --> 03:51:46.008]  I don't know.
[03:52:04.168 --> 03:52:04.568]  We're good.
[03:52:30.673 --> 03:52:43.400]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[03:52:43.820 --> 03:52:47.622]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[03:52:48.002 --> 03:52:54.524]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[03:52:54.864 --> 03:52:58.045]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[03:52:58.285 --> 03:53:05.788]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[03:54:42.915 --> 03:54:44.637]  Yeah, he just died yesterday.
[03:55:26.943 --> 03:55:28.424]  Hard to believe he just died yesterday.
[03:55:28.444 --> 03:55:29.766]  That's kind of our theme song.
[03:55:29.786 --> 03:55:30.546]  We're on the road.
[03:55:30.586 --> 03:55:32.888]  We're in Denver and Virginia for Bilderberg.
[03:55:33.449 --> 03:55:39.534]  I was just informed of this by Richard Reeves, who's been driving us on some of our trips, doing a great job, our navigator and driver.
[03:55:42.036 --> 03:55:44.739]  He is up in Minnesota with George Butler.
[03:55:46.034 --> 03:55:49.435]  And, uh, they have been, uh, they're reporting on it, uh, for Genesis.
[03:55:50.195 --> 03:55:53.276]  And so they can, uh, basically tell us what is going on there.
[03:55:53.296 --> 03:55:54.697]  But I want to finish the song out.
[03:55:54.757 --> 03:55:55.597]  Jerry Reed just died.
[03:55:55.617 --> 03:56:04.960]  I want to play that, um, the, uh, end of the song about, uh, old Smokey's got his ears on, and he's hot on your trail, and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[03:56:04.980 --> 03:56:09.842]  So you got to dodge him, you got to duck him, you got to keep that diesel truckin'!
[03:56:18.426 --> 03:56:31.034]  So you got to duck it, you got to dodge it, you got to keep that diesel truckin'.
[03:56:49.998 --> 03:56:51.959]  Let's go back now
[03:57:07.857 --> 03:57:10.419]  Let's go to George Butler and Richard Reeves.
[03:57:10.740 --> 03:57:14.303]  They're in the Genesis Crows now, up in Minneapolis, St.
[03:57:14.343 --> 03:57:14.643]  Paul.
[03:57:15.224 --> 03:57:17.085]  In Burnsville, to be precise.
[03:57:17.486 --> 03:57:19.788]  Hey guys, give us a quick synopsis of what you've seen.
[03:57:20.368 --> 03:57:30.337]  Okay, Alex, last night on September 7th, Rally for the Republic was held in the center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:57:30.957 --> 03:57:32.599]  And it was called the Target Center.
[03:57:32.619 --> 03:57:35.743]  There were 15,000 people there, and it was crazy.
[03:57:36.043 --> 03:57:38.045]  And Ron Paul gave an inspirational speech.
[03:57:39.647 --> 03:57:40.268]  That's right, Alex.
[03:57:40.288 --> 03:57:42.250]  I'll tell you, it was a really exciting event.
[03:57:42.270 --> 03:57:43.371]  I wish you could have been here.
[03:57:43.391 --> 03:57:50.599]  I'll tell you what was inspirational, Richard, was the fact that Jesse Ventura wouldn't shut up and talk about 9-11.
[03:57:52.109 --> 03:58:01.962]  You know, I made a comment right after his speech that Don Wheat earlier gave a very fine speech, but the most powerful moving speech was given by Jesse Ventura.
[03:58:02.883 --> 03:58:09.251]  That's right, because we all know that 80% of people there are 9-11 troopers anyway, so why should we be muzzled, huh?
[03:58:10.024 --> 03:58:10.304]  Richard?
[03:58:10.805 --> 03:58:11.706]  Well, we weren't muzzled.
[03:58:11.806 --> 03:58:12.646]  We absolutely weren't.
[03:58:12.887 --> 03:58:16.850]  And 9-11 Truth is highly represented here at the Rally for the Republic.
[03:58:17.310 --> 03:58:19.092]  So there's no shortage of 9-11 Truthers.
[03:58:19.132 --> 03:58:24.977]  There's no shortage of people wanting liberty and to uphold the Constitution.
[03:58:25.017 --> 03:58:25.798]  So it's really been a
[03:58:26.438 --> 03:58:27.699]  A great time here so far.
[03:58:28.079 --> 03:58:35.103]  We've really gotten a lot of people fired up, and we've brought in a lot of neocons and woken them up, and it keeps growing every day.
[03:58:35.143 --> 03:58:36.444]  Our movement just keeps growing every day.
[03:58:36.464 --> 03:58:39.645]  And C-SPAN's been carrying it all live on C-SPAN 2.
[03:58:40.186 --> 03:58:41.466]  That's a big victory right there.
[03:58:41.606 --> 03:58:49.111]  All of this is about growing the Movement of Liberty, waking people up, and I'm just so glad that Ron Paul was able to make it with Carol in such dire straits.
[03:58:49.431 --> 03:58:53.233]  We're going to come back in about 60 seconds for five more minutes with Richard Reeves and George Butler.
[03:58:53.613 --> 03:58:59.398]  They're there co-hosting live radio shows for Genesis and live feeds there and doing a fabulous job.
[03:59:00.299 --> 03:59:03.121]  So we'll talk to them when we get back for five more minutes.
[03:59:03.582 --> 03:59:09.767]  Then I've got an expert joining us from Germany about the situation between the United States and Russia.
[03:59:12.310 --> 03:59:14.371]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:59:20.805 --> 03:59:27.189]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[03:59:27.569 --> 03:59:29.530]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[03:59:30.210 --> 03:59:31.251]  But who is the enemy?
[03:59:31.751 --> 03:59:32.272]  Bin Laden.
[03:59:32.532 --> 03:59:33.512]  This is his MO.
[03:59:33.532 --> 03:59:34.893]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[03:59:34.933 --> 03:59:36.374]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[03:59:36.894 --> 03:59:43.658]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[03:59:44.058 --> 03:59:44.498]  Some U.S.
[03:59:44.538 --> 03:59:50.301]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[03:59:50.881 --> 03:59:54.363]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[03:59:54.383 --> 03:59:59.286]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian.
