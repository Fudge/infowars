[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:12.941]  We are finishing up with We Are Change Ireland, a peaceful group who's confronted members of Parliament, Bill Clinton, many others, about how they're selling out their sovereignty and about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.984]  And I learned today that
[00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:33.634]  Last week it was in MSNBC, AP, BBC, headlines about how this wonderful sweet person who did nothing wrong was viciously attacked for no reason by a group of devilish hoodlums.
[00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:53.688]  You can go to, if you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you can see this headline right now on the document cam, Anti-EU Gang Assaults Irish Member of Parliament, Member of European Parliament, and it says they attacked him, they chased him down, they stole his bag, they tackled him.
[00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:55.369]  That's everything he did to them.
[00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.632]  And I didn't even know there was a video of this out, but I predicted
[00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:04.917]  In the office, and in someone on air, though I didn't want to say it on air, I just said, I bet it's the other way around, that that's exactly what happened.
[00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:06.879]  But they cannot have that.
[00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:12.343]  They cannot have one of their people assaulting Irish citizens.
[00:01:12.924 --> 00:01:15.566]  So, they have engaged in a huge lie.
[00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:24.574]  Going back to Keith Bryan and others, Keith, you guys finish up with any other key points that need to be made here.
[00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:33.500]  Alex, it's really important to note that if we can defeat this Lisbon Treaty, like, I mean, this is a huge blow to the globalist idea.
[00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:38.464]  And not only that, like, we've made a documentary and used some endgame footage in it.
[00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:40.105]  It's called End of Nations.
[00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:48.030]  So if people kind of, like, pick that up, even if you're American or if you're in Europe or whatever, just watch that documentary and float the forms and tell everybody about it.
[00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.331]  Because, like, this is the real deal.
[00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:54.214]  And not only that, Alex, if this treaty is ratified,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.122]  It will create a new European Union with new powers.
[00:01:58.423 --> 00:02:03.467]  And not only that, the European Court of Justice can say what our rights are.
[00:02:05.788 --> 00:02:09.731]  And I guess they can make, you know, they can assault you and then say that you've done it.
[00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:21.701]  Well, Alex said in Article 52 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be brought in every vote, yes, Article 52 says that it can be limited.
[00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.723]  Our rights can be limited under a certain vague situation.
[00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.410]  That's how you get to decide.
[00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:33.352]  Well, that's just like the UN Declaration of Human Rights Article 29 and 30 say you have no rights.
[00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:35.492]  So it's always the same M.O.
[00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:39.213]  Yeah, except this one is just a bit longer and more vague.
[00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:42.074]  Yes, well, gentlemen, I want to commend you both.
[00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:45.974]  Give out the Irish website there as you fight the New World Order.
[00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:52.976]  Yeah, it's wacireland.org, wiseupjournal.com and endofnations on Google Video.
[00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.210]  Okay, be very slow about that.
[00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:12.564]  We're going to put links up in the story, but people need to support you, you're under enemy attack, you have been chased down, assaulted, your bag stolen, and then all of it flipped around to, this poor man did nothing and these youths all beat him to a pulp and hurt him and cut him and stole the bag and the police did nothing!
[00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:23.947]  And then you call up Rupert Murdoch's major paper, they call you and you go, okay, here's the police, we call the police, here's the video, and they're like, hmm, and then they go and they write an article saying the opposite.
[00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:28.008]  I think you've got, seriously, you need to get lawyers, you need to start proceedings.
[00:03:28.068 --> 00:03:29.388]  You have been slandered, sir.
[00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:34.629]  Yeah, well we called for a retraction from the newspaper, we emailed the editor.
[00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.910]  Yeah, we need BBC, we need, it was the Sunday Times, correct?
[00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.430]  Did that one with the Sunday Times?
[00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.790]  Yeah.
[00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.572]  Yeah, well BBC, I mean I'm showing people the headline right now.
[00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:50.454]  Anti-EU gang assaults Irish Member of Parliament.
[00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:58.559]  It says Irish former minister was knocked to the ground after a public meeting in Dublin on Monday night according to Labour Party.
[00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:59.600]  Later leader
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.103]  Said that the MEP was confronted by a group of men who screamed abuse at him and knocked him over and pinned him down.
[00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:12.106]  Police confirmed that the attack which left Mr. Rosa bruised and shaken.
[00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:16.248]  The Irish Republic is the only EU member state to have a public vote.
[00:04:16.408 --> 00:04:21.810]  Oh, can't allow the other slaves to vote on the Libsyn Treaty on June 12.
[00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:29.094]  Labour is campaigning for a yes vote on the referendum and has called for a calm and rational debate about the treaty.
[00:04:29.794 --> 00:04:42.684]  EU leaders signed the document in Lisbon last year with the aim of making EU institutions more efficient, more efficient getting the rabble out of the way, now that the bloc has 27 member states.
[00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:50.470]  In his statement, Mr Guillemot said a minority of people had tried to disrupt the meeting using ugly and intimidating tactics!
[00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.053]  And a shouting abuse through a loud hailer.
[00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.395]  I was greatly shocked by what happened to him.
[00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:05.799]  He and a democratically elected representative must be free to walk the streets without threat of physical abuse.
[00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:12.643]  He must be free to walk around and chase people down, growling and ripping bags off of them while foaming at the mouth.
[00:05:13.283 --> 00:05:14.024]  I added that part.
[00:05:14.704 --> 00:05:18.126]  Police took statements from the witnesses, but made no arrest.
[00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:28.811]  Mr. De La Rosa is a well-known figure in the Irish Republic, having served as a cabinet minister in the 1990s and as a member of parliament since 1999.
[00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:30.912]  He was unavailable for comment.
[00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:41.198]  Oh yeah, I had it on camera as well, when Mr. The Ruffer came over, the first thing he said to the police was, they filmed me without my permission.
[00:05:41.218 --> 00:05:44.860]  That's the first thing he said, of the reason why it happened.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:53.965]  Well, he's a public figure, he's a public figure, he's not in a private place, he has no reasonable expectation of privacy.
[00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:57.687]  That's what they do when they cram cameras all over our cities watching us!
[00:05:58.428 --> 00:05:59.829]  You use that right back on him!
[00:06:00.888 --> 00:06:07.451]  And then he held up his finger, it reminded me of like a little fighter, old boy, he held up his finger which he scraped when he fell.
[00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:10.392]  He held up his scraped finger to the police.
[00:06:10.832 --> 00:06:13.973]  He said, I hurt myself.
[00:06:14.293 --> 00:06:21.756]  I remember bullies that would come up and start fights with me and then when they were getting put on the ambulance, they'd be trying to fill out reports that I assaulted them.
[00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:23.137]  But there were always witnesses.
[00:06:24.036 --> 00:06:30.700]  Again, they want to come up to you, they want to attack you, and then when they fall down in their frothing fit, they get mad at you.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.120]  Go ahead.
[00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:35.162]  Yeah, thank God he didn't grab a hold of me.
[00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:37.544]  It could have been a lot worse.
[00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.885]  I wouldn't like that.
[00:06:41.586 --> 00:06:42.987]  Yeah, so I keep wanting to make a point.
[00:06:43.927 --> 00:06:48.070]  Hey Alex, it's important to know, you know, he come over with a little bit of blood coming out of his finger.
[00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.350]  Oh no!
[00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.771]  Oh no!
[00:06:53.326 --> 00:06:54.226]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:06:54.846 --> 00:07:06.489]  But in the paper, one of the party TDs, they're basically just members of Irish Parliament, said that he had blood on his hands as if to make it worse than what it was.
[00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:07.669]  Oh my God!
[00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.931]  You know, what's this country coming to when a Member of Parliament can't assault some young men?
[00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:14.611]  It's unbelievable!
[00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:16.592]  They ran from him!
[00:07:16.772 --> 00:07:22.413]  They should have knelt down to a Lord and allowed him to stomp them in the heads so we could arrest them for assaulting him.
[00:07:23.917 --> 00:07:34.599]  Yeah, but, you know, it's just basically over here all the forms are full of that we attacked and we were the perpetrators and we're scum and we're... Oh my God, it's deadly!
[00:07:35.379 --> 00:07:38.760]  It's a deadly, vicious attack on a member of the Parliament!
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.940]  A member of the European Parliament!
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.541]  Arrest these names immediately!
[00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:47.741]  But notice the police couldn't arrest you because nothing happened because it's staged.
[00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:49.382]  Absolute injustice.
[00:07:49.442 --> 00:07:50.942]  Get your websites out again slowly.
[00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:56.084]  Alex, it's W-A-C-I-R-L-A-N-D dot O-R-G.
[00:07:56.224 --> 00:07:58.884]  That's the website of these outrageous criminals!
[00:08:00.344 --> 00:08:02.425]  And WiseUpJournal dot com.
[00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:09.506]  And if you want to Google search End of Nations Documentary, you will find out that we kind of explain things much better.
[00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:21.188]  And the MEPs, the actually good representatives that represent the people, they come out and they detail the personal stories of the European Union and the corruption that's inside it.
[00:08:21.548 --> 00:08:23.350]  All right, men, good job.
[00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.072]  I'm very sorry that I got on this a week late.
[00:08:26.352 --> 00:08:31.116]  This is just unbelievably outrageous, but that's why the mainstream media is losing all credibility.
[00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:35.300]  That's why the governments are losing all credibility, and I am very upset about this.
[00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:41.786]  There is a story up on PrisonPlanet.com that Watson has done covering this.
[00:08:41.846 --> 00:08:43.847]  I'm asking leaders to get this out everywhere.
[00:08:43.947 --> 00:08:47.751]  Media labels activist questions as gang assault on politicians.
[00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:48.932]  Thank you for coming on, men.
[00:08:50.157 --> 00:08:51.197]  Alex, thank you so much.
[00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:52.758]  Thank you very much Alex.
[00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.726]  We have the video!
[00:09:14.247 --> 00:09:15.488]  Red-handed!
[00:09:15.728 --> 00:09:18.351]  This is a key weapon against the Times of London.
[00:09:18.531 --> 00:09:19.232]  The Sunday Times.
[00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.634]  A key weapon against the BBC.
[00:09:21.814 --> 00:09:28.701]  Just like when we caught them reporting how Building 7 fell 25 minutes before it fell, giving the exact story of how it then did fall.
[00:09:28.721 --> 00:09:30.123]  A little false scripting.
[00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:36.305]  No amount of BBC building seven movies will reprieve you enemy operatives.
[00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:39.386]  Nothing will save you from your criminal activity!
[00:09:39.887 --> 00:09:42.788]  And I'm telling you right now, this is criminal!
[00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:53.072]  To knowingly lie about these men, to knowingly lie and slander good men who are doing nothing more than defending their countries!
[00:09:56.621 --> 00:09:57.763]  See, I'm normal, folks.
[00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:01.768]  You yell and scream about football and baseball when your team loses or wins.
[00:10:02.088 --> 00:10:05.092]  I get mad about tyranny because my life's on the line in this.
[00:10:05.293 --> 00:10:07.396]  This isn't a joke or a game for me.
[00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:08.877]  This is tyranny!
[00:10:12.648 --> 00:10:19.110]  I know we've got callers who've been holding, I know they're holding on both networks, on my board, and they're holding on the network board, and we're going to take your calls.
[00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.871]  I will tell you, we've got somebody coming on about Raeed Hamad, who I think was murdered.
[00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:27.752]  We'll see if people around him are scared, what they're willing to say.
[00:10:27.772 --> 00:10:29.393]  That's coming up in one hour.
[00:10:29.413 --> 00:10:35.274]  I apologize to George Butler, who I invited in, and he's had to sit here for ten minutes while I'm ranting and freaking out.
[00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:38.195]  But George, I mean, does this get you mad?
[00:10:38.823 --> 00:10:39.563]  Yes, it does.
[00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:40.884]  It gets me damn mad.
[00:10:40.904 --> 00:10:45.027]  I mean, I'm sorry to use that word, you know, because usually I refrain from that kind of language.
[00:10:45.087 --> 00:10:55.993]  But gosh, I have to use pretty strong language because, you know, you've trailblazed on many of these issues and your energy is what's carrying this fight forward.
[00:10:56.613 --> 00:10:57.134]  It really is.
[00:10:58.547 --> 00:11:00.149]  Well, it's all I can think about now.
[00:11:00.209 --> 00:11:01.551]  I can't do anything but this now.
[00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:04.054]  It's all I think about because I know we're coming down to the water, George.
[00:11:04.114 --> 00:11:07.038]  It's because you seek the truth, Alex.
[00:11:07.058 --> 00:11:07.679]  You really do.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.064]  And your world view is excellent in that area.
[00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:11.504]  It really is.
[00:11:11.564 --> 00:11:12.205]  It's a good one.
[00:11:12.806 --> 00:11:13.207]  It's right on.
[00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:15.809]  George, I'm probably going to have you sit in in the near future.
[00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:19.893]  I've got Burmess later this week sitting in, because I am working on some projects.
[00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:24.978]  I'm going to be out of town some, and you're a great talk show host in your own right with a weekend show here on the network.
[00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:36.669]  But before I go any further, I know you don't like talking about yourself, George, but you've done a lot of cool stuff, fighting the commies in Germany, and then you were in listening stations with the NSA in Libya.
[00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.431]  Interesting background, and then your research is in a lot of the same areas and the great guests you get on, like the Tibetan folks.
[00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:47.633]  You just have a great show, and so I'm honored to have you as a friend.
[00:11:47.793 --> 00:11:55.455]  It's great to have you here in Austin, you and Bob Dacey and Tex Mars and so many other great folks that live in Central Texas, like Robert Galen Ross.
[00:11:55.475 --> 00:11:59.176]  But I want to really introduce you to my audience, who may not know who you are and your website.
[00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:03.657]  Spend a few minutes talking about yourself, then we're going to get into some of the news items and take some phone calls.
[00:12:04.637 --> 00:12:13.160]  Yes, on Genesis Communication Network, we have a show called The Secret Truth at thesecrettruth.com, along with co-host Charlotte Littlefield-Brown.
[00:12:13.801 --> 00:12:25.445]  And as far as my background goes, I'm a lifetime citizen of Austin, was in the ASA, Army Security Agency, in Europe for three years, spent my last year in Berlin, West Berlin, and saw a lot of very ugly things happen there.
[00:12:26.265 --> 00:12:34.473]  I was 22 years old when I got out of the ASA, so I was pretty well educated in a certain narrow area of communication security and intelligence.
[00:12:35.013 --> 00:12:47.144]  And we saw a lot of tyranny there, and this is probably what's motivated me to continue this fight and to try to reveal the truth about this big mind war system that we're all susceptible to.
[00:12:47.464 --> 00:12:47.945]  Mind war.
[00:12:48.908 --> 00:12:49.469]  That's what it is.
[00:12:49.489 --> 00:12:50.589]  That's what the Germans called it.
[00:12:50.629 --> 00:13:09.725]  You know my parents just got back from southern Germany visiting some family that lives over there in the military and they brought me that famous photo I'd seen before right when they'd put up the barbed wire a few months after and a German family got through but the toddler got caught in the barbed wire and the East German soldier opens the barbed wire and picks him up and lets him through.
[00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:11.246]  Have you ever seen that famous photo?
[00:13:11.286 --> 00:13:12.187]  Yes I have, I have.
[00:13:12.407 --> 00:13:13.148]  No, they gave me a big one.
[00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.529]  I've got it hanging on my office wall now.
[00:13:14.549 --> 00:13:17.372]  In fact, I think I'm going to hang it in here so people can think about it.
[00:13:17.432 --> 00:13:20.114]  You know, they took him, tortured him, killed him, he disappeared.
[00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:24.398]  But the fact is, people have got that choice to ask themselves now.
[00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:25.699]  I mean, they would just machine gun you.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.041]  Tell folks about that wall.
[00:13:27.594 --> 00:13:29.816]  That wall was something else.
[00:13:30.057 --> 00:13:34.561]  There was a lookout point at Bernauerstrasse when I was there in 1965.
[00:13:35.702 --> 00:13:40.728]  And on one side of the street were buildings that had been cemented up, both the doorways and windows.
[00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:43.651]  And across the top of the roofs was barbed wire.
[00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:45.932]  And that actually was the wall.
[00:13:45.972 --> 00:13:57.156]  The front of these buildings on one side of the street was the actual wall, which they tore down later to put in a stronger, more impenetrable type of structure, which they designed later, many years later.
[00:13:57.416 --> 00:14:00.697]  But at that time it was a very, very hideous looking wall.
[00:14:00.777 --> 00:14:02.638]  It was the buildings that had been cemented up
[00:14:02.978 --> 00:14:03.459]  We're good to go!
[00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:26.405]  As they were shooting people.
[00:14:26.425 --> 00:14:28.528]  They were shooting people trying to get out to freedom.
[00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:30.611]  And this tyranny is something else.
[00:14:30.771 --> 00:14:35.738]  And now they're turning America into one giant wall and in Ireland it's the same everywhere.
[00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:39.183]  Yes, it's a scientific dictatorship.
[00:14:39.243 --> 00:14:57.457]  I think there were a couple of Collins brothers that wrote a book back a few years ago, and I think you've interviewed them, and they call it a scientific dictatorship, and they have really done this in very depth, and their expertise about how to control people through ideas and systems of thought is hideous.
[00:14:57.757 --> 00:15:04.503]  And now in Canada, if they catch you without a fare, the police confirm a day that the punishment is being tasered for the poor people that don't have money.
[00:15:05.124 --> 00:15:08.146]  It's like seven bucks to use the subway.
[00:15:08.487 --> 00:15:11.770]  When you're caught sneaking on it without paying, your punishment now is to be tasered.
[00:15:13.062 --> 00:15:14.984]  I mean, see how they're just announcing more and more?
[00:15:15.825 --> 00:15:26.354]  When I was in London in 2006, it was like a maze, running through a maze through the underground and so forth, and they had everything thought out where you would get clipped going in and get clipped coming out.
[00:15:26.854 --> 00:15:33.000]  They had it all down to money, and they were milking everyone for as much as they could in that city, much less the country.
[00:15:33.706 --> 00:15:35.847]  They had it scientifically set up over there.
[00:15:35.927 --> 00:15:58.379]  And what I saw that really impressed me was sitting there with a group of ladies at Buckingham Palace there, getting ready for the tour, is that the riches that they were putting on display so excited the women, especially the women because of all those gowns and all those different awards given to the Queen, that it just, you know, what it does is appeals to the worst things in us.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.600]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.861]  That stuff means nothing to me.
[00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:02.681]  Yes, exactly.
[00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:05.181]  I want to go camp up on the side of a mountain and see the stars.
[00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:05.841]  That's diamonds.
[00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:16.484]  We can only have one God before us, or we can only worship one thing, either God or mammon, and we've gotten into a big, gigantic, worldwide mammon worship system of wealth.
[00:16:16.784 --> 00:16:17.444]  I hate mammon.
[00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.904]  I don't even like the things I've got.
[00:16:19.924 --> 00:16:20.665]  They're a hassle.
[00:16:21.985 --> 00:16:27.166]  Yeah, you know, Wall Street a number of years ago came out with an investment kit for children.
[00:16:28.393 --> 00:16:37.619]  So they want to recruit people into that usury money making system from a young age, 10 or 12 years old, I think, that this particular kit was designed for.
[00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:42.783]  So get them into the investment deal, collect interest, get that usury going and so forth.
[00:16:42.823 --> 00:16:51.208]  And so it's a mind system that's actually been built around a money system of usury taking and paying.
[00:16:52.591 --> 00:16:53.592]  It's just amazing.
[00:16:54.712 --> 00:16:59.075]  How much has America changed since you were back in the military back in the 50s, 60s?
[00:16:59.335 --> 00:17:07.960]  When I was here growing up in South Austin, that's where I grew up and went to school here, it was a much more moral society.
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:11.862]  Drug use was frowned on by the peers.
[00:17:12.402 --> 00:17:18.550]  Anyone that was a drug user was a really scum, just a low-life, and that's the way we looked at them.
[00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:28.962]  Coming into the beginnings of the Vietnam War and so forth, there was a liberalization, you know... Which we now know is the CIA, which they package as counterculture.
[00:17:28.982 --> 00:17:29.883]  Stay there, George Butler.
[00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:31.865]  Everybody, we got a whole other hour.
[00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:35.227]  The first official fourth hour here on the Genesis Network.
[00:17:35.768 --> 00:17:39.230]  And I promise we'll get to some of your calls in the next hour for George Butler.
[00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.493]  He's got a whole host of things he'll be talking about with us today and he'll be giving out his website as well.
[00:17:43.894 --> 00:17:44.434]  Stay with me.
[00:17:48.097 --> 00:17:49.478]  It is a big idea.
[00:17:49.498 --> 00:17:51.599]  A new world order.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.583]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.951]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:18:00.032 --> 00:18:02.274]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:18:02.814 --> 00:18:05.276]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:18:06.017 --> 00:18:13.342]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:18:16.348 --> 00:18:21.312]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:18:21.793 --> 00:18:25.295]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:18:25.676 --> 00:18:28.158]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:18:28.238 --> 00:18:29.279]  Most people have no idea.
[00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:30.159]  They're not after money.
[00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:31.260]  They have all the money they need.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.181]  They're after power.
[00:18:32.441 --> 00:18:33.282]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:18:33.602 --> 00:18:38.126]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:18:38.346 --> 00:18:41.808]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:18:42.369 --> 00:18:44.631]  In Game, prepped for global enslavement.
[00:18:45.051 --> 00:18:46.272]  You have been warned.
[00:18:47.112 --> 00:18:49.253]  My cracked heels were always my nemesis.
[00:18:49.493 --> 00:18:54.175]  All my life, I've had dry heels and rough, thickened skin on the soles and sides of my feet.
[00:18:54.295 --> 00:18:56.977]  Then my podiatrist told me about Kallax Ointment.
[00:18:57.177 --> 00:19:01.119]  I am amazed how fast and efficient this product is at softening the hard spots.
[00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:06.721]  Since using Kallax, the split and cracked skin on my heels is gone, leaving them smooth and healthy-looking.
[00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:08.422]  Kallax moisturizes my skin
[00:19:10.998 --> 00:19:14.820]  My heels and the light peppermint scent keeps any funky scent at bay.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.502]  My feet have never looked better in sandals and I am so grateful.
[00:19:18.622 --> 00:19:22.925]  I've been telling everybody about Calyx and wearing sandals again.
[00:19:23.085 --> 00:19:26.547]  Best of all, the jar lasts a long time, so it's economical.
[00:19:26.747 --> 00:19:29.388]  My podiatrist said that Calyx ointment was different.
[00:19:29.568 --> 00:19:30.369]  He was right.
[00:19:30.469 --> 00:19:35.432]  Calyx uses natural enzymes rather than acid to exfoliate and soften my feet.
[00:19:35.572 --> 00:19:39.234]  There's nothing more satisfying than finding a product that solves your problem.
[00:19:39.534 --> 00:19:42.615]  If you have dry, cracked feet, I recommend Calix Ointment.
[00:19:42.695 --> 00:19:46.696]  You'll find it in the foot care section at drugstores, mass retailers, and super centers.

[00:20:57.895 --> 00:21:01.099]  George Butler is my guest for the next hour and five minutes.
[00:21:01.419 --> 00:21:04.503]  Fourth hour about to start on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:07.967]  Get a list on the network streams or go over to InfoWars.com to our streams.

[00:21:19.998 --> 00:21:22.780]  You can listen over there if you'd like to listen in a lower bitrate.
[00:21:23.961 --> 00:21:28.824]  And if you're a PrisonPlanet.TV member, again, you can see the video cameras, the document cams, everything we've got.
[00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:32.466]  George Butler, what do you want to get into first in the time we've got here?
[00:21:33.206 --> 00:21:43.525]  Well, when you were talking about the New World Order and all that, a name seemed to pop up in my head, and that name would be Kurt Lewin, L-E-W-I-N.
[00:21:45.296 --> 00:21:51.842]  And what he was, he was a German-born psychologist and sociologist that founded an idea of a force-field theory.
[00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:59.008]  And he actually was pioneering in this in the mid-1940s, 1947 actually is when he died.
[00:21:59.328 --> 00:22:05.614]  But he came through England and did some work with the Tavistock Institute and then came over to America.
[00:22:06.297 --> 00:22:13.979]  He got into group dynamics and things like that, but also this field theory is all important for us to begin to try to understand what we're caught up in.
[00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:21.321]  We're surrounded by electromagnetic radiation, and streams of light, you could say, are ideas, and they become implanted in us.
[00:22:21.361 --> 00:22:22.321]  They're streamed to us.
[00:22:22.401 --> 00:22:24.302]  Now, this is what the elite actually believe.
[00:22:24.522 --> 00:22:25.302]  Yes, they do this.
[00:22:25.402 --> 00:22:35.085]  It's the group consciousness, and they've done tests where they'll have monkeys ten miles away from another group of monkeys, and when they teach the other monkeys how to do something, suddenly the others learn.
[00:22:35.385 --> 00:22:37.586]  Yes, that's called quantum entanglement, in fact.
[00:22:37.626 --> 00:22:44.370]  That's an idea or a dynamic where you have instantaneous communication between those two.
[00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.751]  Yes, it's the hundred monkey.
[00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:49.933]  Same thing of like you're in the woods and you know somebody's watching you and you go over the hill and there they are.
[00:22:50.213 --> 00:22:50.453]  Yes.
[00:22:50.493 --> 00:22:51.294]  It's the sixth sense.
[00:22:51.354 --> 00:22:53.635]  But this is what they believe government documents.
[00:22:53.855 --> 00:22:55.896]  Even if you don't believe it, listeners, they believe it.
[00:22:55.936 --> 00:23:02.480]  Just like the crazy rulers of the world, John Ronson's new TV show, you know, has all these top generals, the head of Fort Bragg,
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.962]  Yes.
[00:23:07.342 --> 00:23:09.444]  Much of this is in the head.
[00:23:09.504 --> 00:23:16.148]  The ideas are used and planted and streamed into us and then manipulated from media sources and things like that.
[00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:19.390]  It's a great mind-wash, mind-game, mind-battle.
[00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.751]  Well, let's get into the authoritarian personality, too.
[00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:22.251]  Go ahead.
[00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:22.952]  You got the floor.
[00:23:23.972 --> 00:23:32.379]  The authoritarian personality type, the Frankfurt School, was a school founded by Neo-Marxists in Frankfurt, Germany in the 30s.
[00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:35.761]  And there were some of the greatest minds at the time.
[00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:42.166]  And in their studies and so forth, one of the ideas they came up with was what they called the authoritarian personality type.
[00:23:42.706 --> 00:23:47.291]  And they used this, and from that was parlayed what they call the F-factor.
[00:23:47.591 --> 00:23:49.573]  And the F-factor had to do with fascism.
[00:23:49.993 --> 00:23:56.800]  And that's what makes it interesting in a way, because these people are backed, in a way, by the very fascists that are running the world themselves.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.362]  So they're running both sides.
[00:23:58.382 --> 00:23:59.843]  Yeah, communism and fascism.
[00:23:59.963 --> 00:24:02.626]  It's black uniforms, secret arrests, FEMA camps.
[00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:05.569]  They only give us a false choice of fascism or communism.
[00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:23.219]  Yes, what came out of this, the group that came out of this was a very libertine, very liberal type of thinking that penetrated our universities with some very libertine thoughts, and in fact it's sexual, a liberation of sexuality and so forth was something that really permeated our universities.
[00:24:23.319 --> 00:24:27.442]  But they said only to do that, to pacify the public, so they're busy playing and partying.
[00:24:27.643 --> 00:24:29.384]  We have documents in the 60s in the U.S.
[00:24:29.424 --> 00:24:34.568]  saying, we're going to have a drug culture from 61, and then they drove around with the government buses with the LSD.
[00:24:34.928 --> 00:24:36.610]  Yes, what feels good, do it.
[00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.873]  Ken Kesey had a bus, and he was driving it all over.
[00:24:40.913 --> 00:24:46.498]  It was painted with flowers and everything on it, and he had LSD being distributed from that bus all over America.
[00:24:47.268 --> 00:24:49.130]  Drop acid, drop out.
[00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.813]  Of course, that was Timothy Leary's... Turned out it was FBI.
[00:24:52.953 --> 00:24:55.075]  But that was a very similar type of thinking.
[00:24:55.155 --> 00:24:58.117]  Do your own thing, take a little acid, go on a trip.
[00:24:58.177 --> 00:25:02.261]  By the way, in the 50's, the owners of Timelapse Books, they were all having LSD parties.
[00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:02.701]  Yes.
[00:25:02.841 --> 00:25:05.724]  So the point is, you think you're rebelling against them using this stuff.
[00:25:06.124 --> 00:25:08.006]  The point is, they credit it all, they run it all.
[00:25:08.026 --> 00:25:09.066]  George Butler... Yes, they did.
[00:25:09.867 --> 00:25:10.227]  Stay there.
[00:25:10.247 --> 00:25:12.229]  We'll be right back with the 4th Hour.
[00:25:12.249 --> 00:25:13.590]  This is the Maiden Voyage.
[00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.033]  I hope you'll be with us for the 4th Hour here on the Genesis Network.
[00:25:17.073 --> 00:25:19.575]  We'll be back in just 70 seconds with George Butler.
[00:25:20.216 --> 00:25:25.600]  And then we have some of the folks involved with Raid Hamad to try to find out if he was murdered coming on.
[00:25:29.083 --> 00:25:32.466]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:25:32.486 --> 00:25:34.528]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:50.672]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:25:51.092 --> 00:25:54.917]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:25:55.257 --> 00:26:01.779]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[00:26:42.793 --> 00:26:45.575]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:59.537 --> 00:27:01.158]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:27:01.278 --> 00:27:03.238]  to 3 p.m., four hours a day.
[00:27:03.258 --> 00:27:04.579]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:27:04.639 --> 00:27:13.461]  I want to say hi to everybody watching us on PrisonPlanet.tv with the document cam, the guest cam, the computer feed cam.
[00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:15.762]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:27:19.003 --> 00:27:28.906]  We have someone who worked with the individual who died mysteriously last week, Rayad.
[00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:49.347]  Hamad, and it turns out George Butler, an Austinite since birth, even though some of the teachers at the school where he was a teacher, he was bound, gagged, clearly drowned, the evidence clearly murdered, but the police are saying that, oh no, they said it's quite, I have their press release, it's very normal to have someone bound when they kill themselves.
[00:27:50.227 --> 00:27:52.790]  So, we're going to be talking to that gentleman coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:56.875]  We've got a guest who works with him coming on the show.
[00:27:57.516 --> 00:28:06.145]  George Butler, though, we were getting into just one of their mind control programs and what they really believe, going back almost 100 years ago.
[00:28:06.766 --> 00:28:07.667]  Please continue, George.
[00:28:08.027 --> 00:28:26.158]  Well, we were talking about the Frankfurt School there and the authoritarian personality type, but it is a mind-washed system that conveys into us certain ideas, and then those ideas are manipulated and changed and reformed and massaged within our minds.
[00:28:26.519 --> 00:28:31.842]  We take up this collection of ideas, which I call streams of light, and that forms our worldview.
[00:28:32.637 --> 00:28:35.561]  Having a worldview is a way to control us.
[00:28:36.002 --> 00:28:42.692]  And so we actually become obsessed with extreme worldviews in some cases, and then we fight each other from the left and the right.
[00:28:43.666 --> 00:28:45.027]  Which is again a control paradigm.
[00:28:45.527 --> 00:28:46.407]  Yes, exactly.
[00:28:46.907 --> 00:28:54.270]  So it's hard to see because we're caught up in the field, in the system of thought that we cannot see.
[00:28:54.750 --> 00:29:00.852]  So it's hard for us to see what we're being addicted to and the ideas that we become compulsively addicted to.
[00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:03.253]  It's hard to conceptualize it because it's not visual.
[00:29:03.553 --> 00:29:04.794]  Yes, and it's hard.
[00:29:04.934 --> 00:29:09.916]  The only way you can try to do it is try to stand outside your mind and look back at your thoughts as they're
[00:29:10.356 --> 00:29:12.897]  They're flowing through your mind on a real-time basis.
[00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.458]  You've got to get outside the box and analyze.
[00:29:14.518 --> 00:29:17.719]  Yes, yes, and objectively, and that's hard to do.
[00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:23.381]  So another self, and I always call it the real self, has to try to nurture itself back to health.
[00:29:23.421 --> 00:29:24.542]  It's been wounded from childhood.
[00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:25.982]  See, that's an interesting way you describe it.
[00:29:26.102 --> 00:29:29.404]  I instinctively had this thought when I was three years old.
[00:29:29.804 --> 00:29:34.226]  I'm on the back porch playing, it's a sunny day, the sprinklers spraying, it's like a rainbow, it's beautiful.
[00:29:34.986 --> 00:29:50.652]  And I have this understanding that the world was not me, that I was on an island, no man is an island, and that I had had imaginary games and imaginary friends and played make-believe, and I realized that make-believe wasn't real at that time, and that there was a whole world outside of me, and that I was a tiny island.
[00:29:50.672 --> 00:29:57.934]  I think most people don't consciously think about death, because they seem to see the stream of human society, civilization, and almost think like that is theirs.
[00:29:58.014 --> 00:29:59.014]  No, that is the species.
[00:30:00.695 --> 00:30:07.698]  Just to extrapolate these ideas that I have, realizing that literally the world is what is outside of me, not what is in me.
[00:30:08.038 --> 00:30:11.020]  It is the opposite of what the New Agers teach and everybody else.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:18.363]  And so then you are truly alive when you do realize that there's the rest of the world and that you are interconnected to it.
[00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:25.226]  But most adults I see all have their own little costumes, whatever clique they're a part of, whatever group they're a part of, and they all play to that.
[00:30:25.726 --> 00:30:29.789]  And they're all in little imaginary worlds about what position they're in.
[00:30:29.809 --> 00:30:34.412]  That's why we're into uniforms, signets, class, all of these things.
[00:30:34.453 --> 00:30:34.773]  Go ahead.
[00:30:35.113 --> 00:30:43.639]  Yeah, there was a study that came out of the Stanford Research Institute in the 70s, early 70s, and it was entitled Changing Images of Man.
[00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:52.706]  They went back over 250,000 years to the present and started doing an assessment of the images of man during those eras.
[00:30:53.286 --> 00:31:00.632]  And what they're trying to do in today's world is they're trying to take us back to a very subjective view, just exactly what you said a few moments ago.
[00:31:01.092 --> 00:31:04.535]  And in that subjective view they can control that through the outside media.
[00:31:05.188 --> 00:31:12.291]  But you will give up an objective view of the outside world and take on these inner notions, but without proof.
[00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:16.572]  And that's why they have these games that hundreds of millions play, where it's imaginary worlds.
[00:31:16.772 --> 00:31:17.692]  It's virtual, yes.
[00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:20.994]  It's like a virtual prison that they're building, that we're building for ourselves.
[00:31:21.374 --> 00:31:22.694]  It's an insertion into the matrix.
[00:31:22.734 --> 00:31:23.595]  Yes, exactly.
[00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:24.515]  Exactly, Alan.
[00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:26.451]  George, stay there.
[00:31:26.471 --> 00:31:30.392]  We're going to be right back with George Butler, continue discussing this breakdown, a lot of it.
[00:31:30.632 --> 00:31:38.515]  And then we're going to interview a gentleman who knows a Palestinian man who we believe was murdered right here in Austin, Texas and thrown in the river.
[00:31:38.995 --> 00:31:41.095]  But part of their brainwashing, they tell us it's a lake.
[00:31:41.795 --> 00:31:46.457]  He was thrown in the Colorado River, now known as the Lady Bird Imperium.
[00:31:46.477 --> 00:31:47.397]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:47.924 --> 00:31:53.810]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[00:31:53.931 --> 00:32:05.383]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[00:32:05.783 --> 00:32:06.644]  Here's the story.
[00:32:06.944 --> 00:32:14.809]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:16.170]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.551]  It's 100% legal.
[00:32:17.951 --> 00:32:24.015]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.
[00:32:24.315 --> 00:32:25.196]  It is a big idea.
[00:32:25.216 --> 00:32:25.676]  A new world order.
[00:32:52.578 --> 00:32:57.061]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:32:57.482 --> 00:33:00.244]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:33:00.284 --> 00:33:02.546]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:33:03.086 --> 00:33:05.528]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:33:06.268 --> 00:33:13.714]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:33:16.616 --> 00:33:21.580]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.541]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:28.422]  Build-A-Bergus is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:33:28.482 --> 00:33:29.622]  Most people have no idea.
[00:33:29.642 --> 00:33:30.422]  They're not after money.
[00:33:30.442 --> 00:33:31.522]  They have all the money they need.
[00:33:31.722 --> 00:33:32.443]  They're after power.
[00:33:32.703 --> 00:33:33.543]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:35:11.447 --> 00:35:13.448]  I like your info and your perspective.
[00:35:13.468 --> 00:35:15.029]  You'll be guest host in the next month or so.
[00:35:15.049 --> 00:35:15.530]  You'll do it.
[00:35:17.171 --> 00:35:22.895]  But you've been saying a lot about this gentleman who the evidence shows was killed.
[00:35:24.016 --> 00:35:29.420]  I mean, the APD immediately puts out this propaganda that he killed himself.
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.481]  Oh, he was loosely bound.
[00:35:30.521 --> 00:35:33.644]  This is just kind of like when they killed Gary Webb, shot him twice in the head.
[00:35:35.295 --> 00:35:46.080]  Yeah, it says here, this is the actual quotation out there, when the body was removed from the lake, tape was found around the eyes and the hands and legs were loosely bound.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:52.563]  The bindings of his hands and legs and placement of the tape were consistent with Hamad having done this to himself.
[00:35:52.603 --> 00:35:57.805]  So they were floating the idea on the 16th, Wednesday on the 16th at 2pm, of suicide.
[00:35:58.145 --> 00:36:02.047]  And there's no way that you can get suicide out of this statement in any way.
[00:36:02.307 --> 00:36:04.108]  Yeah, they say it right there in the police statement.
[00:36:04.508 --> 00:36:06.329]  There's just no end to these people.
[00:36:07.449 --> 00:36:24.356]  And it's the same MO, and I read the paper Friday on air, and it said that his family said he had been upset about the FBI coming and grabbing all the school books he mailed to Palestine and spying on him and detaining him.
[00:36:25.157 --> 00:36:28.058]  And then they spun that to mean, oh, he did commit suicide.
[00:36:28.078 --> 00:36:29.719]  It was the same thing with Gary Webb.
[00:36:30.379 --> 00:36:33.581]  You know, he had seen people in his house climbing out the back window.
[00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:34.221]  Then he moved.
[00:36:34.521 --> 00:36:35.662]  He said he was getting threatened.
[00:36:35.722 --> 00:36:37.322]  We had his friends on that said that.
[00:36:37.963 --> 00:36:39.563]  Then they shot him and blew his jaw off.
[00:36:39.603 --> 00:36:40.544]  Shot him in the back of the head.
[00:36:40.604 --> 00:36:42.225]  The guy that exposed the CIA drug dealing.
[00:36:42.525 --> 00:36:43.225]  Pulled a surprise winner.
[00:36:43.245 --> 00:36:45.746]  He had a new book coming out proving everything he'd said.
[00:36:46.167 --> 00:36:46.847]  Vindicating him.
[00:36:47.767 --> 00:36:51.669]  And they had a hit out on him and went and killed him like so many others.
[00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:53.650]  And the police said, oh, I'll never forget.
[00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.072]  It's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head, George.
[00:36:57.921 --> 00:37:12.768]  Yeah, some of the language in this communique from the APD said something like this, information was provided to the missing persons unit by persons close to Hamad, this is what suspects, persons close to Hamad, who are they?
[00:37:12.948 --> 00:37:14.129]  Tell us who they are, okay?
[00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:17.191]  That he had been experiencing suicidal thoughts.
[00:37:17.711 --> 00:37:22.293]  Then later on in the next paragraph they talk about this loosely bound, and put this thing about.
[00:37:22.313 --> 00:37:25.715]  But then two days later when the statesman talked to the family they just said no, he'd been upset.
[00:37:26.445 --> 00:37:27.967]  We need to talk to the family.
[00:37:28.347 --> 00:37:31.591]  Also, they will threaten families and get the family to go along.
[00:37:31.611 --> 00:37:33.373]  Go ahead.
[00:37:33.393 --> 00:37:37.597]  It's like Bobby Kennedy's son won't talk about his dad's murder even though it's now admitted.
[00:37:37.877 --> 00:37:42.843]  Yeah, they floated this just to get the idea out to the public that he committed suicide.
[00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.472]  There's no evidence there that that existed, that he did.
[00:37:46.492 --> 00:37:47.893]  Now you've talked to teachers that knew him.
[00:37:47.993 --> 00:38:00.882]  Yes, a friend of mine came and sat down with me soon after this, on about Thursday sometime, and I think it was after they had disclosed to the teachers that Hamad had died.
[00:38:01.302 --> 00:38:13.230]  And they were, the kids were all upset at the school, Clint's small school, middle school, and also the teachers were mad as hell because this man was very well loved by many of the teachers in the Austin Independent School District.
[00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.653]  They knew him and had worked with him for several years and they admired this man.
[00:38:17.853 --> 00:38:21.655]  By the way, the special guest we've got, are we calling him from our end or the network end?
[00:38:22.155 --> 00:38:22.956]  Has that been flushed out?
[00:38:23.957 --> 00:38:24.597]  We better find out.
[00:38:24.637 --> 00:38:26.098]  That guest is on in about 15 minutes.
[00:38:26.558 --> 00:38:30.280]  So let's find out if we're going to call from here in Austin or the network is going to call.
[00:38:31.161 --> 00:38:35.584]  Alright, let's shift gears back into what you were covering and we'll recap this and have the guest on in about 20 minutes.
[00:38:36.627 --> 00:38:56.701]  Okay, we're picking up on the overall scheme of things is a system and they use systems of thought that they impregnate us with and then those things are manipulated from media and upsetting very things like this GM food and the avian flu epidemics.
[00:38:57.041 --> 00:39:05.988]  They continue to keep us upset and in that upsetness then they can change our views and we begin to reach different conclusions.
[00:39:06.648 --> 00:39:07.669]  I call it a spell.
[00:39:07.689 --> 00:39:10.770]  They're mesmerized with a false map made for the mind where it's like play along.
[00:39:29.097 --> 00:39:34.840]  I mean, that's what all the terror drills and martial law drills and randomly pulling you over because there's terrorists.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:39.663]  I mean, it's all about the illusion and the drills are all about feeding into the hysteria.
[00:39:40.422 --> 00:39:48.507]  Some of the universities in England and Great Britain are dedicated to cognitive dissonance and cognitive psychology, I should say.
[00:39:49.388 --> 00:40:03.056]  And on the West Coast, later on, after Lewin had come in and started establishing his work and his career, the West Coast began to be a cauldron of exactly what you're saying, a subjectivism, an occultism.
[00:40:04.497 --> 00:40:08.860]  Aldous Huxley comes over and starts building ISIS cults on the West Coast.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.304]  And it's all of these things that take us away from being able to discern and establish truth.
[00:40:15.885 --> 00:40:21.529]  And they're all cold-blooded rationalists, but they destroy the old religious orders and bring in new ones to control us.
[00:40:21.649 --> 00:40:23.751]  Yes, they believe in nothing.
[00:40:24.629 --> 00:40:32.214]  But themselves as being Olympian gods, you could say, they describe themselves as Olympians among some of the closer circles, the upper circles.
[00:40:32.634 --> 00:40:39.558]  And the Great White Brotherhood on Mount Olympus, and they argue that, well, they're in control, that means they deserve to be in control.
[00:40:39.879 --> 00:40:41.179]  Well, I argue they're a cancer.
[00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:44.081]  Just because a cancer kills the host doesn't mean it's elite.
[00:40:44.241 --> 00:40:45.202]  It means it's malfunctioning.
[00:40:45.382 --> 00:40:50.368]  Yes, I think Eustace Mullins used the word parasites, I think, in some of his writings.
[00:40:50.729 --> 00:40:54.914]  And they're sucking the blood out of us and the very livelihood through interest in other things.
[00:40:55.134 --> 00:41:03.925]  But not just our money, they're sucking... Madison Avenue at a basic level admits they want to make you feel inadequate to then sell women $100 cream packages that cost $5 to make.
[00:41:05.406 --> 00:41:07.748]  You know, it's all to make you feel inadequate.
[00:41:07.808 --> 00:41:08.829]  Oh, like you're not safe.
[00:41:08.849 --> 00:41:09.669]  Give up your freedoms.
[00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.630]  You're not pretty.
[00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.851]  You've got to have plastic surgery.
[00:41:12.211 --> 00:41:14.213]  Meanwhile, they're missing out on what life's really all about.
[00:41:14.333 --> 00:41:15.073]  Exploration.
[00:41:15.154 --> 00:41:15.774]  Exploring.
[00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:16.655]  Love.
[00:41:16.815 --> 00:41:17.355]  Passion.
[00:41:17.435 --> 00:41:18.176]  Creativity.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:35.545]  Yeah, at one time, that's a very important point, Alex, is that behavioral psychology, the School of Behavioral Psychology, came out of Chicago and Johns Hopkins, and then it moved very quickly to Madison Avenue to put together some of the largest advertising agencies in the world.
[00:41:36.045 --> 00:41:46.869]  They used to want to just modify our behavior, but what they've done now is they've reinvented and put into us identities that we don't really want, if we knew what those identities really would spell.
[00:41:47.369 --> 00:41:48.930]  Let's see, I see what identities are.
[00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:50.812]  I see that they're like a suit of clothes.
[00:41:50.852 --> 00:41:51.412]  Yes, yes.
[00:41:51.492 --> 00:41:52.673]  And I see other people.
[00:41:52.693 --> 00:41:56.436]  It's just like when you see a four-year-old playing with an imaginary character.
[00:41:57.156 --> 00:42:00.619]  I see adults, and I just instinctively learned this, not reading their own documents.
[00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:01.139]  I later did.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.301]  Most people are playland.
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:03.820]  Yes.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.241]  They're playing the big radio executive that runs a network, a patriot network.
[00:42:08.582 --> 00:42:12.443]  They are playing, you know, the beautiful woman, the seductress.
[00:42:12.463 --> 00:42:15.884]  They are, I mean, and that's what police always talk about, our role.
[00:42:16.144 --> 00:42:17.925]  Roles, roles, government roles.
[00:42:18.245 --> 00:42:19.665]  And that's why they're so into drills.
[00:42:20.125 --> 00:42:22.206]  And they don't realize that they're literally under mind control.
[00:42:22.586 --> 00:42:23.246]  Yes, they are.
[00:42:23.987 --> 00:42:28.089]  There's a story that Judith Barr says about the emperor with no clothes.
[00:42:28.469 --> 00:42:34.152]  Well, there's a little kid down there that accompanied his parents to watching the emperor parade down the street with no clothes.
[00:42:34.512 --> 00:42:38.134]  Well, he says to his parents, Mommy, Daddy, the emperor has no clothes.
[00:42:38.154 --> 00:42:39.614]  They say, shut up, shut up, kid.
[00:42:39.895 --> 00:42:42.476]  When they got back home, they ignored it totally.
[00:42:42.956 --> 00:42:49.939]  Meaning that from inception, from our birth, we're seeded in some of the stuff that our parents are subjected to also.
[00:42:50.459 --> 00:42:54.401]  They have not escaped out of it, but they don't know any better by seeding the same system into us.
[00:42:54.421 --> 00:42:55.162]  That's right.
[00:42:55.262 --> 00:42:59.424]  Even if you don't watch television, the mass programming has a feedback loop.
[00:42:59.504 --> 00:43:00.124]  Yes, yes.
[00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:02.565]  And that interacting with others, we have to pick it up.
[00:43:02.765 --> 00:43:03.965]  Yeah, and it's a synergy.
[00:43:04.185 --> 00:43:05.446]  I call it social synergy.
[00:43:05.466 --> 00:43:08.867]  And this social synergy becomes all overpowering.
[00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:14.368]  One influence alone by itself would not maybe make us do a certain action.
[00:43:14.388 --> 00:43:16.409]  There's thousands of brands of propaganda.
[00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:17.209]  Buffet of lies.
[00:43:17.289 --> 00:43:21.310]  And those collectively together overpower us and control us.
[00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.990]  It's a potion.
[00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.251]  Yes, it's a sorcery potion.
[00:43:24.732 --> 00:43:25.312]  That's what it is.
[00:43:25.332 --> 00:43:27.453]  And again, they don't believe in the bubbly bubbly.
[00:43:27.733 --> 00:43:30.475]  Those are analogies for us to subconsciously understand.
[00:43:30.715 --> 00:43:32.376]  A pinch of this, a pinch of that.
[00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:33.677]  Yes, yes.
[00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:34.718]  It's a witch's brew.
[00:43:35.078 --> 00:43:35.838]  It's witchcraft.
[00:43:35.918 --> 00:43:36.639]  It's sorcery.
[00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:38.140]  It's a mind control.
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.121]  That's what sorcery was.
[00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:41.442]  Yes.
[00:43:42.162 --> 00:43:49.827]  It's an alchemy of the spirit, but they want to give us the spirit that they want us to have.
[00:43:50.993 --> 00:43:56.694]  To take us away from our real self and concoct and make a virtual false self.
[00:43:56.714 --> 00:44:15.579]  Well that's because if we're petty and weak and corrupt and groveling then we are so insecure and so afraid we can't ever stand up and get above it at the heights of goodness and just feel the crisp power of it all instead of being down on this level.
[00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:20.420]  They love isolating us in that because when we do break out of that it totally defeats them.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.762]  Yes, if we continue to hate one another, and even hate these people, we'll never get out of it.
[00:44:25.802 --> 00:44:31.605]  We have to forgive, and through that forgiveness we awaken, and we can stand outside and look objectively at our state.
[00:44:31.685 --> 00:44:48.793]  And I agree with that, but what I do, George, subconsciously is, I never did it on purpose, is that I use anger, which short-circuits people they've programmed enough, because they've used anger, to let them wake up, kind of like a blip in the TV screen, so they're angry, so for a minute they see reality, so then they can get out of it.
[00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:49.313]  Yes.
[00:44:49.333 --> 00:44:50.695]  I'm not mad when I'm not on air.
[00:44:50.995 --> 00:44:52.937]  I get mad when I have to focus on this fully.
[00:44:53.337 --> 00:45:03.066]  Yes, you have such an insight and it can be to an extent that you get frustrated at times because you want so badly to tell people what's really going on.
[00:45:03.086 --> 00:45:03.626]  You want to show them!
[00:45:03.646 --> 00:45:10.513]  Yes, yes, but people are people and they're not like a light bulb you turn on and off and it takes a long time to work
[00:45:11.213 --> 00:45:12.554]  For them to awaken.
[00:45:12.874 --> 00:45:21.759]  They're under this influence that's synergistically, addictively, compulsively binding them to a false self that they little see.
[00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.540]  They don't see it.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:28.363]  George, what is the establishment going to do as their sorcery, and it literally is a spell.
[00:45:28.483 --> 00:45:29.664]  It is a spell, yes it is.
[00:45:29.704 --> 00:45:30.425]  We're mesmerized.
[00:45:30.545 --> 00:45:32.005]  I mean the TV screen flickering.
[00:45:32.045 --> 00:45:32.506]  Yes it does.
[00:45:32.566 --> 00:45:35.968]  What are they going to do as that spell evaporates, which is now happening?
[00:45:36.448 --> 00:45:41.071]  Yes, you're on the forefront of helping that occur, you know.
[00:45:42.352 --> 00:45:43.433]  It depends.
[00:45:44.954 --> 00:45:49.737]  The world is communicating to a greater extent than it ever has.
[00:45:49.937 --> 00:45:56.602]  Individuals worldwide are communicating through the Internet, and this has been a God-sent type of technology.
[00:45:57.242 --> 00:46:06.148]  And in doing that, what I always say is that as men, as the communication level increases, then truth is more easily discernible.
[00:46:07.189 --> 00:46:11.271]  With keeping us not, you know, isolated from one another.
[00:46:11.331 --> 00:46:12.292]  Here's an example.
[00:46:12.552 --> 00:46:26.120]  Ten years ago, even five years ago, YouTube wasn't big, or other ones, we wouldn't see the We Are Change Ireland video of the Member of Parliament assaulting them, and then the Times of London would have gotten away with the lie.
[00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.220]  Yes, exactly.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.702]  They could hide behind the curtain, the veil.
[00:46:30.302 --> 00:46:31.483]  But now it's harder to do that.
[00:46:32.082 --> 00:46:37.630]  And if more of you will take your daggers and slice holes in the veil, more sunlight is going to come in.
[00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.512]  Yes, God's light will reach us.
[00:46:40.113 --> 00:46:41.254]  Pull out those daggers!
[00:46:42.256 --> 00:46:43.618]  Well, I've got mine on me!
[00:46:44.018 --> 00:46:45.841]  Alright, stay there, we'll be right back.
[00:46:47.913 --> 00:46:53.919]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home that you can use anytime that helps reduce back pain, sciatica, hip pain and more?
[00:46:54.139 --> 00:46:56.902]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms.
[00:46:57.142 --> 00:46:59.444]  You need the SacroEggie Sacral Stabilizer.
[00:46:59.704 --> 00:47:03.308]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle.
[00:47:03.448 --> 00:47:04.248]  Yes, that's right.
[00:47:04.308 --> 00:47:04.789]  Just relax.
[00:47:04.949 --> 00:47:05.450]  We're good to go!

[00:47:36.696 --> 00:47:37.157]  A new world order.
[00:47:37.177 --> 00:47:40.239]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:47:57.415 --> 00:47:59.576]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:48:00.257 --> 00:48:02.478]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:48:03.018 --> 00:48:05.480]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:13.525]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:48:16.552 --> 00:48:21.534]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:48:22.014 --> 00:48:25.475]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:48:25.855 --> 00:48:28.355]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:48:28.435 --> 00:48:29.576]  Most people have no idea.
[00:48:29.596 --> 00:48:30.356]  They're not after money.
[00:48:30.376 --> 00:48:31.456]  They have all the money they need.
[00:48:31.656 --> 00:48:32.377]  They're after power.
[00:48:32.657 --> 00:48:33.477]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:48:42.259 --> 00:48:44.800]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.480]  You have been warned.
[00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:48.721]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:52.462]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[00:48:52.602 --> 00:48:58.523]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[00:48:58.663 --> 00:49:02.424]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[00:49:02.724 --> 00:49:07.225]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[00:49:07.485 --> 00:49:09.846]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems
[00:49:10.066 --> 00:49:11.948]  Church and state must be kept separate.
[00:49:12.148 --> 00:49:15.891]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:18.614]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[00:49:18.814 --> 00:49:23.918]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[00:49:24.118 --> 00:49:27.501]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[00:49:27.782 --> 00:49:30.424]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[00:49:30.564 --> 00:49:33.106]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[00:49:33.346 --> 00:49:35.028]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[00:49:35.248 --> 00:49:36.589]  Jesus is coming soon!
[00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.932]  For free materials call 888-211-1715 or write The Bible Says, Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee, 37771.
[00:49:46.818 --> 00:49:48.479]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:49:48.779 --> 00:49:52.221]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:49:52.402 --> 00:49:54.243]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:49:54.483 --> 00:49:57.585]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:49:57.885 --> 00:50:03.348]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:50:03.628 --> 00:50:07.531]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:12.775]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[00:50:58.866 --> 00:51:00.007]  George Butler is our guest.
[00:51:00.047 --> 00:51:03.288]  Hey, George, fire out your website for folks that don't know what it is.
[00:51:03.608 --> 00:51:04.049]  Oh, okay.
[00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:07.930]  It would be thesecrettruth.com, and that's a GCN production.
[00:51:08.531 --> 00:51:09.951]  Genesis Communications Network.
[00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:11.572]  So, thesecrettruth.com.
[00:51:11.592 --> 00:51:12.052]  That's a great...
[00:51:13.633 --> 00:51:17.576]  Great website name, thesecrettruth.com, links at GCNlive.com.
[00:51:18.656 --> 00:51:27.182]  George continuing, and we've got a guest rapidly accelerating towards us, I want to keep you on during that, but continuing with the different control modes they have.
[00:51:27.462 --> 00:51:34.107]  We were talking during the break about how they try to also balkanize patriot groups or divide and conquer any resistance.
[00:51:34.727 --> 00:51:45.738]  Trying to make people obsess on one group or another when in their own documents they talk about how they try to dominate every major group and even play those off against each other starting with left-right.
[00:51:46.331 --> 00:51:49.212]  Yes, I think this Denver thing is very dangerous.
[00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:52.973]  I think you had a show earlier last week on Denver itself.
[00:51:52.993 --> 00:52:01.195]  Yeah, the Recreate 68 has subgroups that are calling for attacking police, and now they've come out and said we're white supremacists using classic cop attack.
[00:52:01.335 --> 00:52:01.715]  Yes.
[00:52:01.915 --> 00:52:05.836]  Again, that signature is federal, but we already know they're tied in with it.
[00:52:05.976 --> 00:52:10.478]  Yeah, we saw that during the Vietnam protest era, and the peace movement also.
[00:52:10.518 --> 00:52:16.101]  They went in and infiltrated these peace groups, and then totally agent-profacatured, radicalized them.
[00:52:16.121 --> 00:52:16.841]  Radicalized them.
[00:52:16.861 --> 00:52:17.521]  The weathermen.
[00:52:17.841 --> 00:52:21.223]  Oh, by the way, Clinton did pardon some weathermen.
[00:52:21.283 --> 00:52:22.123]  But that's okay!
[00:52:22.143 --> 00:52:24.184]  Barack Obama's bad!
[00:52:24.705 --> 00:52:31.968]  And Obama did bring that up against her, so I thought that was a pretty good hit on the Clintons.
[00:52:32.068 --> 00:52:33.929]  So they're not what they appear to be, but no one is.
[00:52:34.954 --> 00:52:35.998]  It's a mirage.
[00:52:36.098 --> 00:52:37.022]  It's a delusion.
[00:52:37.102 --> 00:52:39.310]  It's an illusion that's presented to us.
[00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:40.291]  Absolutely.
[00:52:40.311 --> 00:52:57.965]  You know, we were talking during a break about how, you know, I realize there's evil people in control of every major group and I haven't been pigeonholed because we want to have a wide appeal to get everybody to fight the policies of the New World Order instead of making it about a particular racial group or subgroup because then they can pigeonhole us there.
[00:52:57.985 --> 00:53:01.508]  And that's also in their own battle plans to keep us from doing that.
[00:53:01.548 --> 00:53:04.831]  They want to make us pick a group to attack to limit our effect.
[00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:06.691]  Yes, you're exactly right.
[00:53:06.751 --> 00:53:12.373]  What they've done also, they've pitted the Hispanic Americans or the Mexican Americans against the other people in this country.
[00:53:12.693 --> 00:53:20.936]  But what we need to do is we need to wake up on both sides of the border and say, hey, we have our leaders to fear on both sides of the border and them alone.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:27.883]  But at the same time, the threats they create are so real you have to respond, which then feeds into the paradigm.
[00:53:28.263 --> 00:53:38.608]  All I'm saying is, let's be honest, the Mexicans have been taught in Mexico that this belongs to them, and that gringos are bad and need to die, and my whole point is that I'm not trying to balkanize them when I talk about it.
[00:53:38.929 --> 00:53:41.670]  Let's just be honest, just like police.
[00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:45.832]  I'm not against the average cop, but I'm against them being trained for martial law and violating our rights.
[00:53:46.052 --> 00:53:49.694]  Yes, exactly, but they do martial and control those people through hate.
[00:53:50.669 --> 00:53:52.492]  And that's the way they keep everyone separate.
[00:53:54.034 --> 00:53:54.555]  Absolutely.
[00:53:54.635 --> 00:53:55.036]  Continue.
[00:53:55.461 --> 00:54:10.349]  We just need to wake up to these mechanisms and these techniques of continuing to nurture and put forward these very hate-filled ideas about one another, whether it's the Hispanics against the gringos or whatever, or the blacks against the whites, and so forth.
[00:54:10.369 --> 00:54:13.551]  They've got us totally, you know what I mean, at each other's throats.
[00:54:13.911 --> 00:54:16.913]  And it's working, because human nature is susceptible to that.
[00:54:16.933 --> 00:54:18.494]  And that's what they said over a hundred years ago.
[00:54:18.514 --> 00:54:21.556]  They went to the British Crown and others and said, look, we have sciences of the mind
[00:54:22.256 --> 00:54:27.021]  In Germany and in England, the main places it came from, we and two competing schools that merged.
[00:54:27.501 --> 00:54:33.307]  This is all documented and I've had historians and educators and Department of Education policy heads on to talk about it.
[00:54:33.888 --> 00:54:38.773]  And they said we can scientifically craft this and have a dictatorship of the elite that never ends.
[00:54:38.853 --> 00:54:42.917]  And we're a hundred years into this and now they're getting it ready for the mass extermination.
[00:54:43.357 --> 00:54:48.820]  Yes, there's a group in England at Sussex, University of Sussex, that's called the Cogs Group.
[00:54:49.121 --> 00:54:58.806]  And if you go into there, I recommend you go into that website at Sussex and start drilling down into that site and seeing the white papers that that group is putting out.
[00:54:59.166 --> 00:55:04.430]  And I can't even explain and tell you what the titles of some of those papers mean.
[00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:11.794]  They are deeply into mind research and sociology and so forth, and it's really mind-boggling what they're doing.
[00:55:11.974 --> 00:55:13.995]  Universities aren't even for teaching people.
[00:55:14.276 --> 00:55:33.029]  They take your money, your savings, to send your kids to school, and then literally 90% of UT is weapons research, mind control research, or it's for buying corporations, biggest university in the world, here in Austin, 50 plus billion in their liquid cream fund, increasing the taxes, taxes pay for it, no more free tuition.
[00:55:33.769 --> 00:55:46.117]  And you go to the psychology department, and of course they've got them all over the world, their facilities, and I was allowed to see the declassified stuff by somebody that works there, who runs all their computers, and it was all mind control.
[00:55:46.157 --> 00:55:47.058]  They didn't even deny.
[00:55:47.078 --> 00:55:52.021]  It was how to flicker the TV to control us, how to get women sexually excited with TV to sell them products.
[00:55:52.521 --> 00:55:53.782]  I mean, it's all they do 24-7.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:56:03.983]  What I did a while back in my own studies was I took and looked at the isms and I started substituting the word systems of thought.
[00:56:05.063 --> 00:56:14.106]  So there's political systems of thought and so forth and there's psychological systems of thought and so forth and these are all used to compartmentalize us and to manage us.
[00:56:14.366 --> 00:56:17.649]  We're going to have this guest for about 10-15 minutes, but then we're going to come back to you, George.
[00:56:17.689 --> 00:56:18.009]  Stay there.
[00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:19.851]  I want you to question the guest as well.
[00:56:19.871 --> 00:56:22.893]  We really appreciate coming on on the other side of this quick break.
[00:56:23.254 --> 00:56:24.955]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back.
[00:56:25.015 --> 00:56:27.057]  This is the new fourth hour of the show.
[00:56:27.097 --> 00:56:29.999]  We really appreciate all of you for tuning in and joining us today.
[00:56:37.886 --> 00:56:38.827]  We're on the march.
[00:56:39.267 --> 00:56:40.789]  The empire's on the run.
[00:56:41.776 --> 00:56:44.637]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:48.419 --> 00:56:49.620]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.541]  of the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:56:52.561 --> 00:56:54.602]  John, do you have him?
[00:56:54.762 --> 00:56:55.483]  Yes, sir, he's all set.
[00:56:56.403 --> 00:56:59.345]  Thank you, um, of the show.
[00:56:59.365 --> 00:57:02.206]  We really appreciate all of you for tuning in and joining us today.
[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.062]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:57:14.003 --> 00:57:16.665]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:57:20.629 --> 00:57:21.809]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:57:21.909 --> 00:57:24.090]  of the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:27.311]  Allicin, natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:28.051]  is a real thing.
[00:57:28.131 --> 00:57:34.992]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:57:35.132 --> 00:57:45.975]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills flesh-eating bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[00:57:46.135 --> 00:57:46.755]  Take it daily.
[00:57:46.835 --> 00:57:54.819]  It removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues and means a much higher level of wellness for you and your family.
[00:57:54.979 --> 00:58:07.184]  Order today for fighting disease, turning on your immune system, activating infection-fighting properties against sinus, lung, bowel, skin, Lyme disease, nail fungus, colds, flu, ringworm, gum disease, diarrhea, athlete's foot and cholesterol.

[00:58:10.986 --> 00:58:14.467]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:22.951]  Someday, cancer, diabetes, and poor health may disrupt your life.
[00:58:23.131 --> 00:58:25.951]  Are you going to be the one in four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[00:58:26.071 --> 00:58:29.832]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with Alkavita.
[00:58:30.012 --> 00:58:36.713]  Alkavita is a pure elemental liquid silicon that is high in oxygen and highly alkaline to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[00:58:36.893 --> 00:58:43.294]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[00:58:43.434 --> 00:58:46.315]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
[00:58:46.495 --> 00:58:47.915]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[00:58:48.095 --> 00:58:55.660]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:59:05.206]  Your body is the best pharmacy in the world, and with AlkaVita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid and help hydrate your body, promoting the energized, healthier you.

[00:59:11.891 --> 00:59:12.151]  That's 800-651-4011.
[00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.357]  It is a big idea.
[00:59:21.377 --> 00:59:23.478]  A new world order.
[00:59:24.178 --> 00:59:28.400]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:59:29.081 --> 00:59:31.882]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:59:31.922 --> 00:59:34.123]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:59:34.703 --> 00:59:37.145]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:37.885 --> 00:59:40.786]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new prison planet.
[00:59:41.006 --> 00:59:41.507]  TV.
[00:59:41.547 --> 00:59:42.387]  Endgame.
[00:59:42.727 --> 00:59:44.588]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:59:44.788 --> 00:59:45.949]  You have been warned.
[01:00:18.453 --> 01:00:19.294]  We're back live.
[01:00:19.855 --> 01:00:21.076]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.096 --> 01:00:29.904]  I have fellow Austinite George Butler in studio, syndicated talk show host on the weekend here on the network, thehiddentruth.com.
[01:00:31.906 --> 01:00:33.647]  And we have a guest.
[01:00:35.239 --> 01:00:40.205]  Phil Lauredie, and we really appreciate Phil coming on with us.
[01:00:41.026 --> 01:00:42.507]  He is a Ph.D.
[01:00:42.588 --> 01:00:46.012]  human rights activist for peace and justice in Palestine.
[01:00:46.072 --> 01:00:50.176]  He is the treasurer of the organization that
[01:00:51.718 --> 01:01:06.870]  Raed was part of, he last Tuesday came up missing and was found late last week in the Colorado River, a section of it known as Lady Bird Lake here in Austin, Texas.
[01:01:07.951 --> 01:01:14.356]  And so he's obviously one of the closest people we can get to this case and who talked to this man.
[01:01:14.836 --> 01:01:16.637]  People are very upset who know him here in Austin.
[01:01:16.657 --> 01:01:18.739]  George knows some of the teachers at the school.
[01:01:18.799 --> 01:01:19.479]  He was loved.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.461]  George, we didn't make that point clear.
[01:01:21.661 --> 01:01:24.103]  You have friends that are teachers there.
[01:01:24.123 --> 01:01:25.924]  They say he was just loved at the school.
[01:01:25.944 --> 01:01:30.127]  He was well respected and loved by the students and the faculty.
[01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.344]  And he mailed books to Palestinian children.
[01:01:34.464 --> 01:01:40.206]  Yes, he was doing charity work and trying to help those people that were in need over there.
[01:01:40.466 --> 01:01:42.086]  Okay, well people wanted to skip to the bottom of this.
[01:01:42.126 --> 01:01:42.846]  We're trying.
[01:01:43.226 --> 01:01:46.568]  Dr. Paul Laugherty, thank you for coming on the air with us, sir.
[01:01:47.548 --> 01:01:48.548]  My pleasure to be with you.
[01:01:48.588 --> 01:01:49.448]  Thank you for having me.
[01:01:49.929 --> 01:01:50.769]  You've got the floor.
[01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:53.190]  Everybody we're talking to thinks this is suspicious.
[01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.270]  It stinks to high heaven.
[01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:56.150]  Can you tell us what you first heard?
[01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:59.391]  The police first said they thought it was suspicious, then they said it wasn't.
[01:02:01.505 --> 01:02:02.186]  He was bound.
[01:02:02.226 --> 01:02:03.907]  I mean, tell us what you know and what you think.
[01:02:03.967 --> 01:02:06.568]  And I was talking to you during the break when we first got you on.
[01:02:06.608 --> 01:02:11.131]  You said that the whole thing is suspicious, the way he was treated, the way it was handled.
[01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:12.232]  He went on Democracy Now!
[01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:13.273]  about the harassment.
[01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:17.976]  Dr. David Kelly told friends they're going to, quote, kill me if I don't shut up.
[01:02:18.016 --> 01:02:19.397]  And then he was killed.
[01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:20.818]  And the evidence shows he was murdered.
[01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:22.839]  But they said it was a suicide in England.
[01:02:22.879 --> 01:02:24.140]  I mean, there's so many cases of this.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:29.163]  Or is it a suicide where he would stage his own death to make it look like he was murdered?
[01:02:29.184 --> 01:02:30.644]  I mean, that's hard to believe.
[01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:31.425]  You've got the floor to
[01:02:31.465 --> 01:02:32.565]  Tell us what you think really happened.
[01:02:33.566 --> 01:02:44.630]  Well, I probably will put to rest some ideas of conspiracy, but maybe feed some other ideas of conspiracy.
[01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:50.812]  And I believe that there was some conspiracy involved, but perhaps not in the same way that most people do.
[01:02:51.633 --> 01:02:55.774]  With regard to the specific events of Riyadh's death,
[01:02:57.739 --> 01:03:07.024]  In retrospect, all his activities leading up to the time of his death appear to have been organized in order to take care of his affairs.
[01:03:07.265 --> 01:03:22.774]  He was carefully putting his affairs in order and turning over responsibilities and bank accounts and passwords and web accounts and all this sort of thing to other people that were close to him, including myself.
[01:03:27.523 --> 01:03:31.845]  So that's an indication that he was trying to control events.
[01:03:32.806 --> 01:03:46.753]  And I, uh, as far as the, what happened the very evening of his disappearance and his death, um, he, I, I was the one who had the very last conversation with him.
[01:03:47.573 --> 01:03:54.757]  And within a few hours after that, his wife, uh, uh, called me and said, we've reported him missing.
[01:03:54.817 --> 01:03:56.518]  Nobody can find him and so forth.
[01:03:58.181 --> 01:04:13.293]  And, um, the, and then the next call that I got regarding this was from a police detective or investigator who said that they were following up on her report, uh, her missing persons report.
[01:04:14.193 --> 01:04:19.698]  And he said that they, they did have some, uh, new information.
[01:04:20.038 --> 01:04:26.603]  The new information was that, uh, they had traced the cell phone signal
[01:04:27.778 --> 01:04:45.556]  And, uh, into the general area, and they found his car, and the car was unlocked, but the door closed, and on the seat of the car were his, uh, the car keys and his cell phone.
[01:04:46.587 --> 01:04:49.869]  Why would he not leave a note if he did bound himself?
[01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:51.269]  I'll come to that.
[01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.171]  Can we go back to your last conversation with him, since you were the last to talk to him, sir?
[01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:55.831]  Okay.
[01:04:56.271 --> 01:05:10.258]  But here's something that didn't make the news very much, because the one thing that this investigator told me was that they had a photographic record of some of his last moments.
[01:05:11.013 --> 01:05:27.903]  Because, in these situations, they look for, like, ATM surveillance cameras and things like that, and they found a convenience store across the street, I think it was, that did have a camera that captured some of what happened.
[01:05:28.744 --> 01:05:38.089]  And that camera captured him driving up, sitting there for a period of time, then getting out of the car and walking in the direction of the lake, then returning.
[01:05:40.086 --> 01:05:59.119]  to the car getting in the car for a briefer period of time and then getting out of the car again and going to the lake and that um... the uh... uh... that second time was corresponded to the time that he called me.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.881]  Have you seen this footage?
[01:06:02.662 --> 01:06:04.323]  I haven't seen the footage myself.
[01:06:04.563 --> 01:06:09.006]  I think uh... his family has seen it but uh...
[01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:13.199]  But it's in Austin, so they can... Well, that's big!
[01:06:13.239 --> 01:06:14.099]  We're seeking the truth here.
[01:06:14.119 --> 01:06:20.580]  It looks like some dirty dealing to me, but you're saying... And you're the treasurer of the organization.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.401]  Tell us about the organization.
[01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:28.322]  Well, the organization was set up by Riyadh to a large extent.
[01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:38.424]  It was a one-person show, although he had volunteers who contributed in various ways to that, especially in Palestine.
[01:06:39.924 --> 01:06:45.148]  Where he had people who were working on the projects that the organization supported.
[01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:58.096]  Okay, let's get into the part of what he said to you, and we appreciate your time, sir, on the phone right before he reportedly killed himself, and then expand from there what you do believe is a conspiracy.
[01:06:59.276 --> 01:07:03.018]  Well, as it turns out, it was a very routine conversation.
[01:07:05.959 --> 01:07:13.144]  He just asked if I had followed up on his, uh, uh, if I had seen his emails that he had sent earlier.
[01:07:13.164 --> 01:07:14.885]  And I said, yes.
[01:07:15.626 --> 01:07:23.811]  And, uh, uh, then I said to him, well, uh, he was, he was about ready to go.
[01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:31.976]  He, whenever he was on the phone, it was like, he wanted to always get off the phone as quickly as possible, uh, as if he was busy or something.
[01:07:32.097 --> 01:07:35.639]  And so you could never get in a word edgewise, uh, with him most of the time.
[01:07:36.229 --> 01:07:38.030]  And I said, wait a minute, don't go!
[01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:39.950]  I've got some good news.
[01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:49.613]  And the good news is that the account that I set up for PCWF in California had started to receive donations.
[01:07:49.693 --> 01:07:55.254]  Because he was worried about that, that no donations had come into this new account that I'd set up.
[01:07:56.995 --> 01:08:00.016]  Because donations used to come in on a regular basis.
[01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:04.510]  Not only did we receive a donation today, but it was $1,000.
[01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:07.251]  And he said, oh, was it from so-and-so?
[01:08:08.231 --> 01:08:12.813]  And I looked at it, and I said, just a second, let me find it.
[01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:13.813]  He said, oh, it doesn't matter.
[01:08:14.373 --> 01:08:15.373]  And I said, no, no, no, wait.
[01:08:16.934 --> 01:08:22.635]  And so I looked it up, and I gave him the name of the person who had sent the donation.
[01:08:22.876 --> 01:08:25.016]  And it wasn't the same as the one that he thought.
[01:08:25.576 --> 01:08:26.997]  And he said, oh, OK, that's great.
[01:08:27.017 --> 01:08:28.337]  I'm glad to hear it, so forth.
[01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:30.858]  And he said, OK, take care of yourself.
[01:08:31.616 --> 01:08:32.477]  And that was the end of it.
[01:08:32.657 --> 01:08:35.840]  It was a very routine conversation in many respects.
[01:08:36.421 --> 01:08:37.662]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:08:38.703 --> 01:08:54.480]  He had the FBI after him, they detained him, they'd gone through his house and business, taken all his books and things, and gone through all his papers, and so if he is being investigated and people involved with sending school books and money to Palestine and other things are getting arrested,
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:58.783]  Of course he would start phasing out and moving himself out of the business.
[01:08:59.144 --> 01:09:05.229]  And then we have Israel saying in UPI and AP, what, five, six years ago, that they would kill people in the U.S.
[01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:09.433]  supporting Palestine or, you know, any terrorist connections.
[01:09:09.493 --> 01:09:10.554]  I'm not saying Israel did it.
[01:09:10.574 --> 01:09:12.136]  I'm saying we have to look at that.
[01:09:12.176 --> 01:09:14.277]  I mean, his legs are bound, his arms are bound.
[01:09:14.978 --> 01:09:24.443]  Uh, you know, all the, you know, he's got stuff over his eyes, uh, and then you're saying that, I mean, maybe he was meeting somebody at the lake who was going to give him a big donation.
[01:09:24.783 --> 01:09:31.046]  I mean, I'm just saying, the police always have, and it's come out before, they made it look like Bobby was killed by Sirhan Sirhan.
[01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:35.448]  And then now it's come out that three CIA guys were there and they've admitted they killed him.
[01:09:35.929 --> 01:09:41.993]  Or, you know, they made it look like Kennedy was killed by one guy and now it's admitted that he wasn't.
[01:09:42.453 --> 01:09:51.559]  I'm just saying that just because he was getting accounts shifted over to other people, that, I mean, that I don't think proves that he wasn't suicided.
[01:09:51.579 --> 01:09:52.860]  No, I don't think it does.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.562]  But anybody who knows Riyadh,
[01:09:58.055 --> 01:10:04.877]  would know that he would never allow himself to be controlled by other people.
[01:10:05.597 --> 01:10:08.198]  And that, I think, is the real issue.
[01:10:08.238 --> 01:10:10.318]  And that's where the conspiracy part comes in.
[01:10:10.338 --> 01:10:15.099]  Do you think they knew his psychology and tried to push him over the edge?
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:21.261]  Not necessarily, but I don't think they knew his psychology that well.
[01:10:21.641 --> 01:10:24.162]  You have to really be intimate with him to understand that.
[01:10:24.222 --> 01:10:25.122]  I don't think they cared.
[01:10:26.717 --> 01:10:30.320]  As long as they destroyed him, that was what they wanted.
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:30.840]  And they did?
[01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:35.304]  Yeah, and he knew that he was essentially being destroyed.
[01:10:37.586 --> 01:10:48.094]  The mere fact that they took away his records and papers and all that sort of thing, and put some controls on his bank account and took away his
[01:10:49.887 --> 01:10:55.471]  His passport, all of that meant that they were in the process of destroying him.
[01:10:55.551 --> 01:11:02.055]  Now, they never found enough evidence to indict him or arrest him.
[01:11:02.655 --> 01:11:05.297]  Well, they always take everything so you can't fight back.
[01:11:05.337 --> 01:11:06.478]  It's part of SAGE.
[01:11:06.718 --> 01:11:07.799]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:11:07.879 --> 01:11:15.583]  So, that is what was of concern to him, that basically they were destroying what he had created by doing that.
[01:11:15.663 --> 01:11:16.464]  And furthermore,
[01:11:17.026 --> 01:11:24.308]  They were making life problematic, at minimum, for his family.
[01:11:24.809 --> 01:11:27.910]  They were going after his family and interviewing them.
[01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:32.051]  He was concerned, and I think there was justification for this.
[01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:36.553]  Now, I've seen the media calling by Raeed Hamid or Hamad.
[01:11:36.633 --> 01:11:37.753]  Is it Hamidi?
[01:11:37.853 --> 01:11:38.393]  How do you pronounce it?
[01:11:38.413 --> 01:11:39.033]  Riad Hamad.
[01:11:39.474 --> 01:11:39.894]  Hamad.
[01:11:40.234 --> 01:11:41.274]  Finally got it right there.
[01:11:41.574 --> 01:11:41.894]  Hamad.
[01:11:42.475 --> 01:11:42.775]  Gotcha.
[01:11:42.815 --> 01:11:43.055]  Sorry.
[01:11:47.488 --> 01:12:00.617]  He was very concerned for what was happening to his family, that in effect the investigators were trying to get at him through his family, and that they were going to accuse his family members of being part of a conspiracy.
[01:12:00.697 --> 01:12:04.860]  Oh, so he did that, you're saying he killed himself to protect his family by destroying the only link?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.586]  Yeah, and at the same time he was to some extent protecting his
[01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:24.770]  Well, I'm not saying I agree with you that they drove him to suicide, but I do see your point and I do see the Palestinians.
[01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:33.255]  What is this cultural thing about... Well, I think he was a hero for doing what he did because what he was saying is, I'm not going to let you
[01:12:35.308 --> 01:12:47.177]  Yes, and to maybe make some people doubt me and hate me and all that sort of thing.
[01:12:48.138 --> 01:12:52.782]  I'm not going to give you control over my life and over my family or anything like that.
[01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:53.882]  I'm going to take control.
[01:12:54.003 --> 01:12:56.565]  And his way of taking control is not only to
[01:12:57.839 --> 01:12:58.180]  I think?
[01:13:10.027 --> 01:13:22.633]  And, you know, I don't by any means want to end the speculation about how somebody might have murdered him.
[01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:24.894]  Because that's his legacy.
[01:13:24.914 --> 01:13:26.875]  Yeah, Paul, this is George Butler.
[01:13:26.895 --> 01:13:28.856]  I have a couple of comments here.
[01:13:29.665 --> 01:13:36.631]  For one, why don't they present the video to us so we can look at it and analyze it, and it could diffuse this speculation about murder.
[01:13:36.651 --> 01:13:37.852]  Yeah, that should be out quickly.
[01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.615]  Number two... Normally they would, by the way.
[01:13:40.935 --> 01:13:46.700]  Number two, we need more details on the bounding of Raid himself.
[01:13:47.661 --> 01:13:49.062]  There are reports it says loosely.
[01:13:49.102 --> 01:13:50.924]  Was it loosely or was it firmly bound?
[01:13:51.164 --> 01:13:52.866]  If he was firmly bound, then it was murder.
[01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:57.351]  Whether it was loosely or tightly, if Riyad really wanted to do it, I think he could find a way to bind himself tightly.
[01:13:57.411 --> 01:13:58.912]  I don't know the details of this.
[01:14:18.402 --> 01:14:20.943]  But he was pretty ingenious.
[01:14:20.983 --> 01:14:24.884]  So he's going to blind himself and walk down to the lake and throw himself in.
[01:14:25.324 --> 01:14:26.284]  It's not consistent.
[01:14:27.064 --> 01:14:29.665]  The story that they floated is not consistent with suicide.
[01:14:30.505 --> 01:14:33.626]  Well, as far as I know... What time did he supposedly do this?
[01:14:33.646 --> 01:14:34.806]  Because it's so busy down there.
[01:14:36.027 --> 01:14:43.649]  Yeah, see, I don't know too much about the details, but... Well, he called you, you're saying, right before he killed himself, or we're speculating.
[01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:44.629]  I mean, when did he call you?
[01:14:46.425 --> 01:14:57.469]  The call was Monday night, the 14th at 7.30 in the evening, my time, which would be 9.30 in Austin.
[01:14:57.569 --> 01:14:58.569]  Well, we know this.
[01:14:59.349 --> 01:15:03.591]  We know that Mossad does run around killing people all over the world, do they not?
[01:15:04.391 --> 01:15:06.472]  Well, that's the other thing.
[01:15:06.632 --> 01:15:09.993]  He had reported to me that his neighbor
[01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:30.138]  Uh, had seen people, two people with funny accents and, uh, and, uh, guns, automatic weapons that, uh, that looked like, uh, uh, the Galil, uh, weapons that, uh, that were next door.
[01:15:30.198 --> 01:15:32.939]  Now, all I can do is report to you what he said to me.
[01:15:33.819 --> 01:15:35.720]  Well, he doesn't sound like somebody who makes stuff up.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.001]  Did you know him to make up stuff?
[01:15:38.568 --> 01:15:39.169]  Uh, no.
[01:15:39.429 --> 01:15:48.394]  Not to make up stuff, but, uh... Okay, so his neighbor, his neighbor sees people with, quote, funny accents with what looks like Israeli rifles.
[01:15:50.884 --> 01:15:57.266]  The information I have also from my sources say that the neighbors were approached several months before for surveillance.
[01:15:57.426 --> 01:15:58.906]  They were trying to set up surveillance.
[01:15:58.986 --> 01:16:00.746]  Is that correct?
[01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:05.267]  Some of the surveillance people were these people with funny accents.
[01:16:05.287 --> 01:16:06.408]  You're getting this from teachers.
[01:16:06.568 --> 01:16:10.869]  I got it from two different TV stations that heard the scanners that it looked like he'd been tortured.
[01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:15.252]  Well, yeah, I think the tapes should be released.
[01:16:34.662 --> 01:16:52.226]  I know at one time I was asked not to mention these in interviews because the case was still under investigation, but as far as I'm concerned,
[01:16:53.267 --> 01:17:01.570]  Because supposedly they were still pursuing the idea that he was murdered, and so there were certain things that they didn't want to reveal publicly.
[01:17:01.710 --> 01:17:08.553]  Paul, I know that a lot of this stuff may seem like little points to you, but every little tidbit is big.
[01:17:08.613 --> 01:17:15.095]  Specifically, what did he say about men with foreign accents and Israeli-style machine guns at the neighbor's house?
[01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:19.878]  That they were watching and that they had communicated with the U.S.
[01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:20.958]  investigators.
[01:17:21.699 --> 01:17:22.579]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:22.599 --> 01:17:24.499]  We need a full-blown investigation.
[01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:28.140]  A very, very... We need a panel of specialists.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.281]  Look, the Israelis are good.
[01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:30.281]  The Israelis are good.
[01:17:30.321 --> 01:17:34.282]  They make it... Look, I don't want them killing me and everybody saying I committed suicide.
[01:17:34.542 --> 01:17:36.043]  Dammit, I'm not killing myself.
[01:17:36.063 --> 01:17:40.664]  When he told me that, I asked him to take photos of them if possible.
[01:17:40.684 --> 01:17:41.404]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:17:41.424 --> 01:17:42.024]  We've got a break.
[01:17:42.044 --> 01:17:43.065]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:43.585]  Unbelievable.
[01:17:47.805 --> 01:17:56.209]  Of the three million plus edible food plants that grow on earth, no other single plant can compare with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[01:17:56.509 --> 01:18:02.192]  At HempUSA.org we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the US and Canada.

[01:18:12.999 --> 01:18:15.240]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.621]  This nutrient... Let me talk time.
[01:18:16.641 --> 01:18:19.362]  ...can be stored up to five years when vacuum... Sure, one second.
[01:18:20.419 --> 01:18:22.761]  3 million plus edible food plants that grow on earth.

[01:19:19.277 --> 01:19:19.578]  Fact.
[01:19:19.758 --> 01:19:25.503]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[01:19:25.763 --> 01:19:29.987]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[01:19:30.067 --> 01:19:37.533]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.

[01:21:24.049 --> 01:21:32.171]  Okay, the website is PCWF, as in Palestine Children's Welfare Fund, dot org.
[01:21:32.231 --> 01:21:36.292]  And all of the information of where to send tax-exempt donations is right there.
[01:21:50.464 --> 01:21:51.804]  Okay, I want to make this point.
[01:21:52.044 --> 01:21:56.486]  I have made preparations for the government to kill me, because I've been threatened and physically attacked.
[01:21:57.546 --> 01:22:00.727]  And then they can later spin that to say, oh look, he was... You do.
[01:22:00.747 --> 01:22:02.308]  You know, well see, you do.
[01:22:02.728 --> 01:22:03.828]  Oh look, he's suicidal.
[01:22:03.908 --> 01:22:04.788]  Oh look, he's bad.
[01:22:05.549 --> 01:22:10.050]  He knows that Mossad or Shinbad or whatever hit team they hired is running around his house.
[01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:11.350]  The neighbors are telling him this.
[01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:13.271]  Of course he starts getting ready to die.
[01:22:13.931 --> 01:22:22.455]  And a lot of times, what I've been told by people in DEA, CIA, FBI, that when a mafia group hits you, they usually contract with somebody else to do it.
[01:22:22.495 --> 01:22:27.738]  They come into your house, it's dark, they say, okay, come with us, you're going to write a suicide letter or we're going to kill your family.
[01:22:28.438 --> 01:22:30.999]  Watch your daughter get dropped off at school today, I'm going to rape her.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.320]  I'm going to cut her head off.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.001]  I'm going to rape her for a couple days before I kill her.
[01:22:35.322 --> 01:22:37.723]  Or maybe we'll fly her into Saudi Arabia to a slay brothel.
[01:22:38.343 --> 01:22:39.524]  Well, there's more to it than that.
[01:23:06.164 --> 01:23:22.016]  Because the timing of it, I discussed this with Riyad, I believe that the raid was connected to my cooperation with Riyad, with another organization, the Free Gaza Movement, that is taking boats into Gaza this summer in defiance of the Israeli blockade.
[01:23:22.805 --> 01:23:36.771]  And we were at a stage where he was going to get those boats for us, and him being taken out of the picture at that time with the FBI raid really caused some damage, not complete damage, to what we were doing.
[01:23:37.712 --> 01:23:42.434]  Ah, now we learn how it turned into a military operation, why they probably gave the red light.
[01:23:42.674 --> 01:23:44.014]  And again, they're very slick.
[01:23:44.054 --> 01:23:44.995]  They say they're the slickest.
[01:23:45.635 --> 01:23:46.355]  Comments, George?
[01:23:46.596 --> 01:23:48.716]  What kind of operation was that again?
[01:23:48.776 --> 01:23:50.017]  What kind of operation was that?
[01:23:50.237 --> 01:23:51.838]  It was bringing aid supplies on boats.
[01:23:53.011 --> 01:23:59.256]  Aid supplies, no, but we're taking volunteers in there to end the blockade of Gaza.
[01:23:59.476 --> 01:24:04.360]  And this was at a crucial time when he was involved in boat procurement for us.
[01:24:04.981 --> 01:24:08.203]  But this was a charitable type of operation?
[01:24:08.504 --> 01:24:15.409]  It was a human rights operation, similar to... No military implications of any kind?
[01:24:15.549 --> 01:24:18.852]  I mean, you guys have had them go over you with a fine-toothed comb.
[01:24:18.872 --> 01:24:20.974]  I mean, you guys all espouse peaceful, right?
[01:24:21.781 --> 01:24:22.442]  Yeah, of course.
[01:24:22.922 --> 01:24:30.148]  But the point is, if they wanted to disrupt our operation and end our operation, that would have been a very good way to do it.
[01:24:30.228 --> 01:24:33.631]  And so that's where we believe the Israeli connection came in.
[01:24:33.691 --> 01:24:38.675]  That the Israelis fed something to the U.S.
[01:24:38.715 --> 01:24:42.298]  investigators in order to cause this disruption.
[01:24:43.258 --> 01:24:44.680]  But they've been after him for years.
[01:24:48.354 --> 01:24:50.795]  For decades, they've been after him.
[01:24:50.835 --> 01:24:51.815]  This is not the first time.
[01:24:51.835 --> 01:24:54.055]  Well, the Israelis were seen running around with machine guns.
[01:24:54.095 --> 01:24:56.696]  They did that on purpose to create and instill terror.
[01:24:56.996 --> 01:24:58.757]  Doctor, we're going to call you back right now.
[01:24:58.797 --> 01:25:02.518]  We'll be back on the other side for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers in one minute.
[01:25:03.158 --> 01:25:04.618]  Thank you, Doctor.
[01:25:04.638 --> 01:25:04.938]  Stay there.
[01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:05.918]  We're going to call you right back.
[01:25:05.958 --> 01:25:07.499]  We're trying to get to the bottom of this.
[01:25:07.659 --> 01:25:09.939]  Quite a mystery, quite a whodunit.
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.220]  Was it
[01:25:13.024 --> 01:25:14.845]  Was it the poor Palestinian man?
[01:25:14.885 --> 01:25:15.706]  Or was it Mossad?
[01:25:15.726 --> 01:25:16.586]  Was it FBI?
[01:25:17.627 --> 01:25:18.107]  Who knows?
[01:25:18.187 --> 01:25:19.268]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:23.971 --> 01:25:24.171]  Alright.
[01:25:24.591 --> 01:25:25.212]  Thank you guys.
[01:25:25.252 --> 01:25:26.032]  Thank you, Genesis.
[01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:27.273]  Anytime.
[01:25:27.673 --> 01:25:28.213]  Take care.
[01:25:28.374 --> 01:25:30.195]  Okay, we're going to continue our discussion here.
[01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:46.199]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, kind of a rough start here of Overdrive.
[01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:49.880]  I've got so many responsibilities, phone calls, work to do, but this is so important.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:55.502]  We're going to get the doctor back on with us, Paul Laugherty.
[01:25:55.802 --> 01:25:58.943]  Here he is on the document cam.
[01:25:59.803 --> 01:26:04.284]  Just absolutely incredible, the things that are going on right now.
[01:26:04.544 --> 01:26:06.825]  While we're lining him up, George, final comments on this.
[01:26:06.845 --> 01:26:07.545]  This is amazing.
[01:26:07.625 --> 01:26:24.179]  Yeah, what I would say, as far as what I see right now, one of the weak problems in this whole thing right now, and it actually can expose it, is let's bring forward those eyewitnesses that saw those agents with guns that were in nearby neighborhood homes or something.
[01:26:24.519 --> 01:26:27.362]  That is something that needs to be explored to its nth degree.
[01:26:28.482 --> 01:26:31.865]  Yeah, this needs to be all over the papers that he saw these people.
[01:26:32.206 --> 01:26:40.033]  Israel admits, and we have UPI and AP, they're running around domestically, and I tell you, man, this is incredible.
[01:26:40.093 --> 01:26:42.296]  This is just... We need to take back our country.
[01:26:43.357 --> 01:26:43.997]  We really do.
[01:26:44.057 --> 01:26:47.601]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:26:49.113 --> 01:26:54.195]  I mean, and you know, you've got to know, Israel's got the Homeland Security head, they've got the Attorney General.
[01:26:55.095 --> 01:27:05.339]  I mean, there's no doubt that it's the biggest lobby in Washington, and they said they'd kill American citizens if they want, and you know, we're talking about this now, I wonder if they're going to come kill me and say I committed suicide.
[01:27:05.379 --> 01:27:11.841]  I mean, you know, and I don't even want to attack Israel, but I can't sit here while Israel does this inside my country.
[01:27:12.609 --> 01:27:15.531]  I'm not even enemies with Israel, but they're out of control.
[01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:17.352]  They're turning our country into a police state.
[01:27:17.372 --> 01:27:18.513]  They're working with the globalists.
[01:27:18.553 --> 01:27:19.334]  It's all one group.
[01:27:19.814 --> 01:27:20.755]  They're all working together.
[01:27:20.955 --> 01:27:21.255]  George?
[01:27:21.595 --> 01:27:28.220]  The teachers should organize that knew him and lobby to get down to the bottom of this.
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.561]  They should call a press conference!
[01:27:29.881 --> 01:27:40.393]  The teachers should call a big press conference, an independent school district press conference, get as many people together as you can, and demand that we get down to the bottom of this.
[01:27:40.433 --> 01:27:41.595]  Well, you know where she lives.
[01:27:41.615 --> 01:27:43.236]  You're a good guy, a diplomat.
[01:27:43.256 --> 01:27:44.057]  We need to go talk to her.
[01:27:44.077 --> 01:27:46.881]  Because they always tell the women, shut up, be quiet, everything will be okay.
[01:27:47.881 --> 01:27:50.986]  Yeah, right, now there's that mourning period we have to respect, of course.
[01:27:51.006 --> 01:27:55.833]  Okay, let's bring the doctor up for five more minutes and then maybe we can get him back up tomorrow for a part two.
[01:27:56.094 --> 01:27:57.095]  We have to end this show.
[01:27:57.716 --> 01:28:02.203]  Sir, in the last five minutes, Dr. Paul Laugherty, who is the
[01:28:03.505 --> 01:28:06.786]  I'm your main guy working with the deceased on all of this.
[01:28:07.566 --> 01:28:09.547]  Tell us any other key points you've got.
[01:28:09.567 --> 01:28:10.107]  Anything else?
[01:28:10.127 --> 01:28:12.508]  I mean, this is so suspicious what you're saying now.
[01:28:12.808 --> 01:28:18.570]  I understand you're trying to be balanced and say maybe he killed himself, but God, when you look at it on the other side of this, it's just incredible.
[01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:30.073]  Well, the question I was just raising before we switched over to web streaming is about the timing of this.
[01:28:30.894 --> 01:28:41.443]  Because Riyadh had been under a person of interest, let's say, with the FBI and the IRS for a very long time.
[01:28:42.103 --> 01:28:55.154]  So, what exactly, and he sent me copies of his previous communication with the FBI, but what made them act at this time?
[01:28:55.254 --> 01:28:57.336]  Well, I asked Riyadh, you know,
[01:28:58.075 --> 01:29:11.545]  He was, quite frankly, right on the verge of closing a deal for one of the boats that we were going to use in the operation this summer, which is going to happen anyway, by the way.
[01:29:12.505 --> 01:29:20.571]  It's set for August 5th, and the idea is that we're taking Israelis and Palestinians and South Africans and
[01:29:21.007 --> 01:29:28.772]  People from all over the world, including priests and rabbis and imams and a former member of the British Parliament.
[01:29:28.932 --> 01:29:30.553]  They don't want that solidarity!
[01:29:30.593 --> 01:29:33.715]  They don't want that image!
[01:29:33.815 --> 01:29:34.436]  No, they don't.
[01:29:34.576 --> 01:29:38.038]  They don't want that circumventing of their authority there.
[01:29:38.518 --> 01:29:39.059]  Exactly.
[01:29:39.119 --> 01:29:46.523]  They do not want their blockade of Gaza to be run and the rights of Palestinians to be asserted.
[01:29:49.403 --> 01:29:55.106]  You know, I said to him, do you think this has anything to do with the fact that you were about to close?
[01:29:55.166 --> 01:29:57.807]  And he said, yes, I think it does.
[01:29:57.867 --> 01:30:01.069]  This is their way of disrupting what we're doing.
[01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:05.771]  And they temporarily did disrupt it and caused us to lose some money.
[01:30:06.627 --> 01:30:11.110]  In the process, but that's not it's not going to stop us, but I think that may have been their attempt.
[01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:15.452]  OK, doctor, doctor, can you go back, Dr. Paul Lority?
[01:30:15.852 --> 01:30:20.195]  Can you go back specifically and tell us what he told you?
[01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:22.256]  I mean, as specifically as possible.
[01:30:22.276 --> 01:30:23.737]  I know you had multiple conversations with him.
[01:30:23.997 --> 01:30:34.262]  What others told you about the men creeping around his house, talking to the neighbors that, quote, spoke funny and had machine guns, which, of course, they wanted to get back to him or they wouldn't be walking around with these.
[01:30:38.525 --> 01:30:40.906]  Well, I don't know very much.
[01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:42.447]  He didn't tell me very much.
[01:30:42.487 --> 01:30:43.768]  He didn't know very much.
[01:30:44.088 --> 01:30:49.171]  I mean, all he could do is to say what he saw and heard with his neighbors.
[01:30:49.392 --> 01:31:04.621]  But there were two men with an appearance that for them appeared foreign and had strange accents.
[01:31:05.719 --> 01:31:10.662]  And they were observing what was going on.
[01:31:10.702 --> 01:31:14.524]  They were communicating with the FBI and IRS.
[01:31:14.625 --> 01:31:18.647]  In Austin, there's a big contingent that opposes taxi drivers.
[01:31:19.207 --> 01:31:23.510]  Yeah, but they did not actually come into Riyadh's house.
[01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:33.896]  They stayed on or near the neighbor's property and looked through some of the spaces in the fence and things like that.
[01:31:34.705 --> 01:31:47.312]  So, and he sent me a picture of the fence, but that's not much good without... I asked him to take some pictures, if possible, of the men themselves, and he apparently was unable to do that.
[01:31:47.332 --> 01:31:47.832]  Oh, God.
[01:31:47.932 --> 01:31:49.333]  But the neighbors told him about this?
[01:31:49.773 --> 01:31:50.013]  Yeah.
[01:31:50.854 --> 01:31:51.254]  Jeez.
[01:31:51.754 --> 01:31:52.615]  It just never ends.
[01:31:54.376 --> 01:31:56.257]  It just absolutely never ends.
[01:31:57.818 --> 01:32:00.139]  Oh, another thing I might mention to you is that
[01:32:01.134 --> 01:32:09.857]  More recently, he got one of his friends whose materials were among those that the investigators carted away.
[01:32:11.057 --> 01:32:17.439]  And he got that person to call the investigators and say, well, listen, I need these materials back.
[01:32:17.459 --> 01:32:23.501]  Do you have any idea when this investigation is going to be finished so that I can get those materials?
[01:32:24.961 --> 01:32:28.222]  And apparently, the investigator told the friend,
[01:32:28.962 --> 01:32:33.327]  That they hadn't even begun to look through the materials that they had taken.
[01:32:34.068 --> 01:32:39.695]  So here it is, maybe six weeks after the materials were taken, and they hadn't even opened the boxes.
[01:32:40.043 --> 01:32:45.666]  Well, we know that 99.9 percent, and they admit that, of tens of thousands of terror arrests, they have one conviction.
[01:32:46.206 --> 01:33:06.196]  Usually it's just a big show of arresting brown people and acting like they're fighting some terror threat, or finding mentally retarded street kids in Miami and giving them a hundred grand to videotape a government building, or finding a blind cleric and finding two mentally retarded guys on city welfare to drive the truck and the FBI cook the bomb, train the driver.
[01:33:06.696 --> 01:33:07.997]  I mean, I just wish they'd stop it.
[01:33:08.237 --> 01:33:10.658]  You know, I wish they'd just keep us out of all this.
[01:33:10.678 --> 01:33:12.598]  And I understand you've gotten involved in all of it.
[01:33:13.078 --> 01:33:14.459]  How did you get involved in this, Doctor?
[01:33:14.499 --> 01:33:15.819]  I mean, this is wild.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:23.642]  Well, I've been involved since 1965, actually, which is when I first went to Palestine.
[01:33:25.623 --> 01:33:29.004]  But it went up another level in, say, 2001, 2002, when I
[01:33:33.373 --> 01:33:38.214]  I participated with the International Solidarity Movement in some non-violent resistance actions there.
[01:33:38.255 --> 01:33:49.678]  I was shot in the foot, and later, two years ago, this was by an Israeli who also shot six others that I was with at the time, an Israeli soldier.
[01:33:49.898 --> 01:33:57.640]  And then, two years ago, I was arrested upon entering Israel, and held for two weeks, and ultimately deported.
[01:33:57.881 --> 01:33:58.761]  Did they torture you?
[01:33:59.161 --> 01:33:59.621]  No, no.
[01:33:59.881 --> 01:34:02.422]  Israel's the only country in the world with legalized torture, you know that, right?
[01:34:02.825 --> 01:34:06.549]  Yeah, no, they wouldn't want to do that.
[01:34:07.130 --> 01:34:09.552]  They didn't hold me in that kind of facility.
[01:34:12.716 --> 01:34:19.804]  I don't think it makes sense for them to do that, just from the consequences.
[01:34:24.045 --> 01:34:31.386]  I'm sure you saw this week, all these Israeli soldiers are going public about torturing, killing people, and admitting they just do it for fun.
[01:34:32.187 --> 01:34:42.489]  That's why they're going to end up losing, is that you can't just shoot little kids for fun, and all the videos of them killing little kids and laughing, or the videos of our troops just shooting families in their cars for fun.
[01:34:42.509 --> 01:34:48.630]  I mean, it's scary, because they're bringing all these people, all these troops back home here, and God, we really have turned into Nazis.
[01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:51.611]  It just scares the hell out of me.
[01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:55.173]  I can't believe our world is this bad, and you've got the courage to go be in the middle of it.
[01:34:56.434 --> 01:34:59.637]  I have to tell you, I'm scared of being killed so I can't continue my work.
[01:34:59.677 --> 01:35:00.777]  I'm not scared of them killing me.
[01:35:01.278 --> 01:35:03.359]  I'm scared of them killing me so I don't continue my work.
[01:35:03.379 --> 01:35:04.940]  Do you understand the point I'm making, Doctor?
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:06.121]  Of course, of course.
[01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:10.704]  And I just like, my God, it's just evil keeps winning and winning and winning.
[01:35:10.744 --> 01:35:12.025]  Do you get the point I'm making?
[01:35:12.085 --> 01:35:15.728]  Sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it fails, and that's what we have to work for.
[01:35:16.636 --> 01:35:19.919]  Well, I know you're a very busy person, but I'd like to try to get you back up on the show.
[01:35:19.939 --> 01:35:26.344]  People want to see what you guys do and learn more about you to decipher themselves, if you're wicked or good.
[01:35:26.905 --> 01:35:27.605]  What's the website?
[01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:35.752]  The website for PCWF is PCWF.org, and I'll mention also the Free Gaza Movement.
[01:35:36.613 --> 01:35:38.074]  It's FreeGaza.org.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:41.821]  Where you can learn about what we're doing this summer.
[01:35:42.162 --> 01:35:43.163]  What is Israel going to do?
[01:35:43.203 --> 01:35:53.111]  They've lost all the PR advantage they had running over Michigan girls with no criminal record with a bulldozer twice and laughing about it as she bleeds with a broken body.
[01:35:53.552 --> 01:35:55.253]  I mean, it just isn't going to work anymore.
[01:35:55.293 --> 01:35:58.095]  Do they know that minute by minute they're turning the world against them?
[01:35:58.896 --> 01:36:06.062]  Yeah, well we have to use that because it's the only way that we're going to get our rights back and the rights of Palestinians
[01:36:07.722 --> 01:36:14.586]  I just don't understand the chutzpah of running over a woman with a bulldozer and laughing about it.
[01:36:16.827 --> 01:36:17.768]  It's got to stop.
[01:36:18.869 --> 01:36:33.437]  Well, one theory is that they were testing the water at that time to see if they could do it and get away with it because they did that to three of our volunteers, two of whom were killed and one of whom almost died with wounds to the face.
[01:36:34.331 --> 01:36:36.052]  All in the space of one month at that time.
[01:36:36.092 --> 01:36:37.233]  Did you know Rachel Corey?
[01:36:38.014 --> 01:36:39.414]  I didn't know her personally, no.
[01:36:39.695 --> 01:36:48.280]  I know her parents, but I did know Brian Avery, who was the one shot in the face a few weeks later in Janine.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.100]  He was a friend of mine.
[01:36:49.921 --> 01:36:56.865]  Would you say that the people got mad at it, or would you say that those killing US citizens to test the waters were successful?
[01:36:57.966 --> 01:36:59.827]  Oh, I think they were totally unsuccessful.
[01:36:59.907 --> 01:37:00.567]  Nowadays, if
[01:37:01.761 --> 01:37:10.748]  When I encounter people who are new to the issue, and I tell them I'm from the International Solidarity Movement, I ask them, have you heard of the International Solidarity Movement?
[01:37:10.788 --> 01:37:11.869]  They say, no, I don't think so.
[01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:22.037]  I say, did you hear about the 23-year-old woman from Olympia, Washington, who was killed by a bulldozer in Gaza a couple of years ago?
[01:37:22.057 --> 01:37:23.058]  Oh, yes, of course!
[01:37:23.559 --> 01:37:26.581]  Now, that's not a public relations coup for Israel.
[01:37:27.068 --> 01:37:32.410]  And that's, I think, why the experiment didn't work, why they tried it for a month and then stopped.
[01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:37.711]  You know, you know, Rayid Ahmed, he sent a letter to George Bush.
[01:37:37.771 --> 01:37:38.232]  I just got it.
[01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:40.332]  We're going to post it up on JonesReport.com right now.
[01:37:40.352 --> 01:37:41.833]  I wonder if that could have made him mad.
[01:37:42.533 --> 01:37:43.893]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:49.135]  He was very confrontational and he was very good in his letter writing.
[01:37:49.972 --> 01:37:55.637]  Okay, well, Doctor, I'd like to have my producer call you and maybe set you up for 20 minutes tomorrow to add to all of this.
[01:37:55.758 --> 01:38:02.324]  We really appreciate your time, and you have amazing courage, one, but can't help admire your humanitarianism, and I hope you're right.
[01:38:02.344 --> 01:38:06.187]  I hope it was suicide, because I know I'll sleep better at night, but I don't think it is.
[01:38:06.768 --> 01:38:07.869]  This thing sticks to high heaven.
[01:38:07.889 --> 01:38:08.870]  We'll talk to you soon, Doctor.
[01:38:09.261 --> 01:38:10.002]  Okay, thank you.
[01:38:10.242 --> 01:38:10.703]  Take care.
[01:38:12.124 --> 01:38:12.565]  God bless.
[01:38:13.826 --> 01:38:16.249]  In closing, George, you've got the floor and I've got to run.
[01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:19.092]  In fact, I've got to leave right now.
[01:38:19.333 --> 01:38:22.276]  How about I let you go for ten minutes and give everybody your analysis of this.
[01:38:22.536 --> 01:38:24.879]  You can start co-hosting right now.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:26.441]  You just go ahead and stay over there.
[01:38:27.782 --> 01:38:28.543]  You go ahead and stay over there.
[01:38:28.563 --> 01:38:35.030]  I'm going to leave now, and you go ahead and tell everybody what you think about this for 10 minutes, and then we'll bring George out of here at 24 after and meet the other radio show.
[01:38:35.071 --> 01:38:35.972]  You've got 15 minutes, George.
[01:38:36.312 --> 01:38:48.406]  Okay, listening audience out there, you've heard a personal account of a man that was killed, murdered, and they're alleging suicide, some of the authorities are.
[01:38:49.007 --> 01:39:00.161]  They're telling us that there was a tape, but they're not forthcoming with the videotape yet that would prove up maybe a possible suicide on Town Lake, or it's called Lady Bird Lake now.
[01:39:00.622 --> 01:39:03.426]  This has taken place in Austin, Texas.
[01:39:04.226 --> 01:39:24.001]  And we have a man that was just interviewed by Alex Jones, Paul Lardy, and he had been involved with different organizations that had been over in Israel, actually in Gaza, and also he'd gone over there and he'd experienced some very harsh treatment himself over a number of years.
[01:39:24.422 --> 01:39:25.663]  I think he was shot in the foot.
[01:39:25.743 --> 01:39:27.944]  Some of his friends were actually killed over there.
[01:39:28.525 --> 01:39:32.568]  There's a great number of people that care about the Palestinian cause.
[01:39:33.328 --> 01:39:43.720]  And they're going over to the West Bank and to Gaza and providing charity also to some of those people over there that have been suffering for a number of years.
[01:39:45.402 --> 01:39:48.486]  Some of the points made by Riyad Hamad's death
[01:39:49.326 --> 01:39:51.168]  I believe are very flimsy.
[01:39:51.748 --> 01:39:58.833]  Some of the first reports put out by the APD, I think, do not have very much substance to them.
[01:39:59.633 --> 01:40:02.716]  There were different things by Paul Lordy.
[01:40:02.736 --> 01:40:06.178]  He said something about, well, if he was going to bound himself, he would do it very well.
[01:40:06.598 --> 01:40:10.241]  Here they're reporting a loosely bounding of his ankles and hands and stuff.
[01:40:10.501 --> 01:40:15.144]  Nobody's going to tie themselves up and throw themselves in a lake and commit suicide like that.
[01:40:15.164 --> 01:40:16.065]  It's not probable.
[01:40:16.565 --> 01:40:22.529]  It's not likely, and as a result, it's probably not true that he committed suicide.
[01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:23.529]  I don't know for sure.
[01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:25.311]  All the facts are not in.
[01:40:26.211 --> 01:40:35.397]  We do know that there's a large number, many teachers that knew of his teaching and his ability, and they respected him as a man, as a teacher.
[01:40:35.797 --> 01:40:43.082]  He's working on a PhD in keyboarding, one of the computer science, computer media, I think they might call that today.
[01:40:43.782 --> 01:40:48.584]  So, this man was a citizen of the United States of America.
[01:40:48.965 --> 01:40:49.945]  He was well-liked.
[01:40:50.005 --> 01:40:52.526]  He was a responsible citizen.
[01:40:52.906 --> 01:41:07.293]  He was doing charity work for Palestinian kids, and now the newest thing that they were into was taking and creating a boat bypass of the Israeli authorities, which probably angered them to a large extent.
[01:41:09.934 --> 01:41:13.316]  I don't know why, you know, or how he met his final death.
[01:41:13.336 --> 01:41:16.357]  There were other details that were brought out in the interview also.
[01:41:16.957 --> 01:41:26.741]  And some of those details would get back to there was surveillance and there were some very suspicious people in that neighborhood that were surveilling him and keeping him under watch.
[01:41:27.421 --> 01:41:31.223]  These were foreign looking people with some kinds of submachine guns.
[01:41:31.703 --> 01:41:34.444]  Could be described as Israeli type machine guns.
[01:41:35.044 --> 01:41:40.546]  This came out and was reported from neighbors back to Riyadh, Hamad.
[01:41:41.207 --> 01:41:48.350]  So as we're getting more and more into this death that occurred, a very tragic death here in Austin, Texas.
[01:41:49.090 --> 01:41:55.212]  They believe that the first police report, I believe, took place on Wednesday, April 16th.
[01:41:56.613 --> 01:41:57.073]  We're good to go.
[01:42:20.391 --> 01:42:26.775]  On Tuesday, April 15, 2008, information was provided to the Missing Persons Unit by persons close to Hamad.
[01:42:27.075 --> 01:42:27.975]  Who are those persons?
[01:42:28.316 --> 01:42:30.677]  That he had been experiencing suicidal thoughts.
[01:42:30.997 --> 01:42:35.960]  Well, those people need to come forward and tell us what, you know, if that is an accurate statement.
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:36.941]  A.P.D.
[01:42:36.981 --> 01:42:40.484]  continued its attempt to locate Hamad with the assistance of his family.
[01:42:41.185 --> 01:42:42.646]  On this same day, A.P.D.
[01:42:43.047 --> 01:42:47.912]  located Hamad's vehicle parked near Lady Bird Lake.
[01:42:48.312 --> 01:42:51.836]  An extensive search was conducted of the area, but Hamad was not found.
[01:42:52.734 --> 01:43:09.839]  Well, in the interview with Mr. Laugherty, Paul Laugherty, he stated that there was tape that was from some security camera in the nearby area that show Hamad driving down to the lake, then walking down to the lake, coming back to his car and so forth.
[01:43:10.279 --> 01:43:17.842]  But I mean, I want to see, if there was a tape doing that, then maybe there's a tape showing him bounding himself up, I don't know.
[01:43:18.462 --> 01:43:22.084]  We need to continue to ask questions.
[01:43:22.624 --> 01:43:34.591]  The teachers within the Austin Independent School District need to go out and lobby very strongly and make their feelings known about getting down to the truth of this matter and so forth.
[01:43:36.232 --> 01:43:44.697]  We just have to continue to ask questions and not put anybody under a cloud of suspicion.
[01:43:45.577 --> 01:43:53.642]  The police department is probably acting well-intentioned, and everyone concerned here, I'm sure, is acting with good intentions.
[01:43:54.382 --> 01:44:06.694]  It's just that we need more information and we need more people forthcoming to get us down to a real bottom line analysis and a conclusion and a summary of exactly what did happen.
[01:44:08.038 --> 01:44:08.938]  I think so far.
[01:44:11.819 --> 01:44:15.101]  My own opinion is not suicide.
[01:44:15.181 --> 01:44:21.083]  I just don't think that many people would conduct suicide in this manner.
[01:44:21.163 --> 01:44:22.744]  It just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:44:23.304 --> 01:44:24.845]  He was under investigation.
[01:44:25.905 --> 01:44:29.847]  He was under death threats and so forth.
[01:44:30.447 --> 01:44:35.869]  Some boxes he had sent over there to Gaza and to the Palestinians had been returned.
[01:44:36.749 --> 01:44:41.151]  There were people suspicious in his neighborhood and so forth.
[01:44:41.531 --> 01:44:47.933]  So it looked like to me that he was responding to get his affairs together to take care of his family.
[01:44:48.813 --> 01:44:51.274]  He was anticipating murder here of himself.
[01:44:52.214 --> 01:44:56.698]  That's sort of my analysis at this point without any further information.
[01:44:56.858 --> 01:45:07.186]  Or tapes being seen of him throwing himself into Lady Bird Lake, binding himself up across the mouth and eyes and stuff and throwing himself in.
[01:45:07.566 --> 01:45:10.929]  It's consistent with murder when you tape a person's eyes.
[01:45:11.889 --> 01:45:17.574]  You especially tape a person's eyes and mouth so they cannot cry out for help.
[01:45:18.334 --> 01:45:21.835]  Then you bind them up, their legs and so forth, so they cannot swim.
[01:45:22.295 --> 01:45:27.177]  Their hands and his legs were bound so that they could not swim, and then you throw the guy in there.
[01:45:27.977 --> 01:45:32.058]  And this is consistent with a murder of drowning.
[01:45:32.118 --> 01:45:40.001]  Just, you know, the man could not swim, could not get himself out of those bindings, and as a result he drowned.
[01:45:41.161 --> 01:45:47.105]  So that's basically my analysis at this point, not having any further information.
[01:45:47.425 --> 01:45:54.550]  And we don't have all the information, so we have to be careful in making and reaching quick conclusions in this area.
[01:45:55.210 --> 01:46:02.515]  But again, I call on the students and the teachers there to get out here and get the word out and demand
[01:46:03.035 --> 01:46:08.817]  More answers to many of these questions that are not being answered at this time.
[01:46:09.357 --> 01:46:17.039]  And especially the video that was talked about earlier about him walking down to Town Lake and so forth.
[01:46:18.879 --> 01:46:20.020]  Let's bring it forward.
[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:21.020]  Give it to the press.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:22.040]  Let's see it.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.180]  Put it on the internet.
[01:46:23.781 --> 01:46:24.681]  Let us look at that.
[01:46:24.761 --> 01:46:28.782]  Of course, with respect for his widow, we have to be careful here.
[01:46:29.982 --> 01:46:35.403]  That we certainly respect her privacy and so forth.
