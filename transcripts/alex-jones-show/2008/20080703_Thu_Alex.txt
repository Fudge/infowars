[00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.771]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:13.432]  to 3 p.m.
[00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:14.372]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:15.173]  We're here live.
[00:00:15.773 --> 00:00:24.139]  Jason Mermins will be sitting in for me tomorrow when Truth Rising is released at PrisonPlanet.tv and on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:26.540]  Truth is rising all across the world.
[00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:34.306]  The people are waking up to the Global Crime Syndicate, to their activities taking over our food, our water, our resources, our liberties, our freedoms.
[00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:47.760]  We are joined by Congressman Ron Paul, Dr. Ron Paul, for the rest of this hour, the next 25 minutes or so, to cover what's happening with the economy, what's happening with the build-up for war with Iran, what's developing here domestically.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.287]  Both parties basically coming out for torture, coming out for warrantless wiretapping.
[00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:54.348]  We'll cover the gamut.
[00:00:54.588 --> 00:01:11.824]  But before we go any further, tragically last Thursday, we didn't learn about it until Monday because the family was private, the head of the Ron Paul 2008 campaign, friends with Ron Paul since 87, Kent Schneider, just a great guy who you could call at 10 o'clock at night on a Sunday about
[00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:12.704]  Yes, it would be nice.
[00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:13.625]  It's really a sad event.
[00:01:13.665 --> 00:01:15.767]  Kent worked with me and for me in the campaign in 1988.
[00:01:16.127 --> 00:01:17.428]  He was a college student back then.
[00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:45.096]  That was the Libertarian campaign, and he's worked for me essentially ever since.
[00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:48.598]  There was a small break there, but he was involved in D.C.
[00:01:48.658 --> 00:02:04.846]  with me, and then he was the one that I gave credit to for really giving the final sales pitch, and I think even you had encouraged me to run before I did, and a lot of people did, but it was finally Kent who sat down and outlined the value of it.
[00:02:05.587 --> 00:02:07.589]  And so I give him a lot of credit.
[00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:15.614]  If we did achieve anything, if it was a worthwhile venture, which I believe it has been, Kent deserves a lot of credit for it.
[00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:30.244]  Congressman, since you mentioned the worthwhile venture, and Kent pushing you over the edge, or the camel's straw that set all this in motion, the straw that broke the camel's back, we've had a great victory.
[00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:32.726]  And I always want the listeners to realize that
[00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:35.828]  Tens of millions of people now know the Federal Reserve is private.
[00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:39.631]  They know about the currency tax, the inflation tax.
[00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:41.812]  They know about the New World Order.
[00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:58.084]  Instead of there being a fake neocon or communist choice on the colleges, everywhere I go and all the people I talk to say, the new dominant force isn't liberal or conservative, it is true liberty, what you'd call constitutionalist.
[00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:01.906]  And you running, it just has energized so much.
[00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:02.667]  Can you speak to that?
[00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:11.006]  Well, you know, we discovered there were a lot of folks that have been around for a bit and have known about it, and you've talked to them for many, many years.
[00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:17.909]  And I knew there were a large number of individuals like that, but I didn't know how the young people would respond.
[00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:29.294]  And to me, it's amazing how the young generation has just jumped on this and realized what's going on, and they put together the burden of debt and the wars going on in the welfare state.
[00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:37.275]  And so many young people that come to my office now and talk to me and say, boy, did you open up my eyes about the Federal Reserve.
[00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:38.515]  I've been studying that.
[00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:42.436]  So I think, you know, we've really lit a fire.
[00:03:42.937 --> 00:03:45.777]  And that's not me, personally.
[00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:47.538]  I mean, it was everybody put together.
[00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:51.679]  People like you that have been involved for a long time, plus everybody else.
[00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.280]  But, you know, a lot of people got after me for this recent article.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.141]  They said, oh, no, he's too optimistic.
[00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.461]  They think we can do some good.
[00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:14.397]  Well, I'm cautiously optimistic and I know what kind of a fight we have up to, but I am a bit more optimistic now because of the response that we have had and the willingness of so many people willing to look at the Federal Reserve.
[00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:18.622]  But we also have to realize how powerful they are and how much control they have.
[00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:24.704]  Congressman, I agree.
[00:04:24.784 --> 00:04:31.306]  I mean, you can't overstate the effect this has had, your running has had.
[00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:32.846]  I mean, it really broke the dam.
[00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:37.248]  I see that as a major new plateau in the
[00:04:38.248 --> 00:04:49.839]  Reawakening of liberty, a new renaissance, legalizing freedom as you put it so well, and it is just almost immeasurable what's happened.
[00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:51.680]  We know we're in a lot better place
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.502]  With the public being informed than we were just a year and a half ago.
[00:04:56.942 --> 00:05:02.665]  And again, you're right, the credit goes to the tens of millions of Ron Paul supporters that have energized and woken up so many people.
[00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.487]  And the victory is in resistance.
[00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:08.029]  And the victory is in that both parties are
[00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:09.349]  Absolutely.
[00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.430]  I think truth is what we're after.
[00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:45.902]  And the fact that the government is failing at everything that they do, whether it's the monetary system, the welfare state, the protection of our freedoms, or our foreign policy, it's so obvious that that is the reason we have such a vital role to play.
[00:05:46.223 --> 00:05:47.083]  We can complain.
[00:05:47.143 --> 00:05:49.325]  We can point out all the problems and condemn the Fed.
[00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.431]  I think so.
[00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:09.524]  Also have the program that will give the answers to the problems that we have.
[00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:11.565]  Giving people a real solution.
[00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:14.706]  It's one thing to say that those are bad choices, which is true.
[00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:16.586]  We're now giving people an option.
[00:06:16.886 --> 00:06:25.569]  Tell us briefly about the shift in the campaign to this new organization and how the people can energize that even more than it already is energized, Congressman.
[00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:29.112]  Well, it's been going well.
[00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:32.353]  We have a new group, it's called Campaign for Liberty.
[00:06:32.473 --> 00:06:34.894]  It's just a continuation of the other campaign.
[00:06:34.954 --> 00:06:37.375]  It's always a Campaign for Liberty as far as I'm concerned.
[00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:46.758]  And it's in its early stages, and of course we're backing and promoting right now the big rally in Washington on July 12th.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.441]  And I'll be there, and we're pushing that.
[00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:59.083]  But then, of course, the new organization we're pushing very, very hard, a rally up in Minneapolis at the same time the Republicans are having their rally.
[00:06:59.643 --> 00:07:05.485]  And this will be a positive rally for all the views and all the good things that we stand for.
[00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:09.926]  So if anybody's interested in that, it's really easy to find out more about the organization.
[00:07:09.986 --> 00:07:12.507]  Just go to campaignforliberty.com.
[00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:18.409]  Absolutely, and I want to restate the obvious, because some people don't consciously understand this.
[00:07:42.688 --> 00:07:45.831]  Started the Revolutionary War when the British came to confiscate the guns.
[00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:52.296]  And it was about 5% that beat the greatest army on earth that had never been defeated.
[00:07:52.737 --> 00:07:57.681]  The British Redcoats were called the Invincibles at that time because they'd beaten everybody.
[00:07:57.721 --> 00:08:00.303]  They went on a few years later to beat Napoleon.
[00:08:01.624 --> 00:08:05.248]  And we lost most of those battles, but it was the willingness to keep coming back
[00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:09.489]  to the fight that finally brought down that enemy.
[00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:11.810]  And we're going to be remembering that tomorrow.
[00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:17.993]  Can you say some words about what America is really about in its second birth?
[00:08:18.733 --> 00:08:23.855]  I mean, I think this is a very important July 4th that we're going to be having in less than 24 hours, Congressman.
[00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:30.304]  Well, the wonderful thing about our revolution was it proved the old adage that ideas do have consequences.
[00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:36.293]  The founders weren't just a ragtag bunch of guys getting together and saying, well, let's go after the British.
[00:08:36.954 --> 00:08:39.959]  They were philosophers and they knew history.
[00:08:40.852 --> 00:08:44.795]  And they had this all put together and they knew and understood it.
[00:08:45.215 --> 00:08:59.824]  Now the most unique thing about our revolution was that, for the most part, when revolutions usually come about, they come about by the failure of one state and somebody else comes in and usually one group of thugs replaces another group of thugs.
[00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:01.985]  Our revolution was unique
[00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:10.394]  In that the people had more freedom rather than less freedom, and it wasn't just a replacement of one group of authoritarians with another group.
[00:09:10.594 --> 00:09:14.497]  Just like with the French Revolution, instead of just being just as bad, it got even worse.
[00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:20.221]  That's right, and it was all done, you know, the Jacobins were, oh, they were delightful people.
[00:09:20.261 --> 00:09:23.103]  Some people compare them to the neocons, to the Jacobins.
[00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:27.206]  Oh, we're all doing this for the goodness of the country and the people.
[00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:31.609]  We're over there helping the people of Iraq, and we're going to take care of people at home here.
[00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:45.775]  So, yes, but they can turn into thugs when they say, well, we are such good people, we are going to force you to do it, and if you don't obey us, and if you don't become good like we are, we're going to kill you.
[00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:48.857]  And this is what we're approaching.
[00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:52.359]  Now, just think of all these laws that have been put on the books today.
[00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.963]  So far, they haven't rounded up tens of thousands.
[00:09:57.725 --> 00:10:03.071]  There's hints that they might if it gets out of hand, because they certainly have the authority on the books now.
[00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:10.418]  So it's going to be a tough fight, and that's why our ideas and the ideas or continuation of the founders' ideas
[00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:12.870]  Must have consequences.
[00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.393]  You know, armies can't stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:10:16.953 --> 00:10:20.356]  And that's why I still remain optimistic.
[00:10:20.676 --> 00:10:21.797]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:10:22.118 --> 00:10:27.082]  You don't have to wait for a vote of 51% of the people to endorse our ideas.
[00:10:27.122 --> 00:10:30.485]  You have to have people that are ideologically dedicated.
[00:10:31.085 --> 00:10:32.887]  And then they will go out and do the work.
[00:10:33.187 --> 00:10:38.552]  And the others will come along, especially when they see the failure of one system and they know it has to be replaced.
[00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:44.922]  And if they have any common sense, why do they want to replace it with another authoritarian government?
[00:10:45.243 --> 00:10:49.005]  Why don't we go back to the positive attitude about how freedom works?
[00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:53.221]  Well, I agree with you, and I love the Victor Hugo quote.
[00:10:53.582 --> 00:10:56.405]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[00:10:56.765 --> 00:11:03.211]  That's actually how my new film, Truth Rising, I'll send you a copy, Congressman, starts, is with that quote.
[00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:03.872]  But you're right.
[00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:08.937]  We can't just let the old system fall apart on its own weight, which it clearly is going to do.
[00:11:08.977 --> 00:11:12.340]  The question is next month or five years from now, you know, it could happen any time.
[00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:16.805]  Probably sooner rather than later, but will it fall into something even worse?
[00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:20.028]  Some new socialism or some new fascism?
[00:11:20.308 --> 00:11:25.053]  Or will we be there at the time of, you know, where the system is liquid?
[00:11:25.073 --> 00:11:35.984]  During a revolution it becomes liquid to get control of the reins and then get us back to sound money and a sound system and restore the republic that you've been working so hard to do, sir.
[00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:37.385]  I think?
[00:12:07.505 --> 00:12:08.766]  $8 a gallon gas.
[00:12:08.886 --> 00:12:21.054]  If we attack, you're talking about in a story here for Press TV, Ron Paul, Iran will triple energy prices, break down what we're going to see with energy if we don't attack, or what you think will happen if we do.
[00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:23.968]  Well, if we do, it's going to be a disaster.
[00:12:24.048 --> 00:12:25.568]  Obviously, it's going to be pushed up.
[00:12:26.088 --> 00:12:28.989]  The other day, I was astounded on one of the business stations.
[00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:31.130]  They were talking about Iran.
[00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:39.932]  And they were talking about it in terms of not, are we going to, but the debate was, do you think they're going to bomb before the election or after the election?
[00:12:40.212 --> 00:12:43.453]  So it's sort of like a foregone conclusion that we're going to.
[00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:47.034]  And why wouldn't the oil prices be bid up?
[00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:48.675]  So there is a lot of speculation.
[00:12:48.715 --> 00:12:49.655]  There's a lot of that.
[00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:53.558]  And then they turn around and say, well, it's the speculators that are doing it.
[00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:56.199]  Well, the speculators are sometimes smart people.
[00:12:56.239 --> 00:13:05.466]  Their job is to go out and speculate and find out what the price is due to current events, monetary policy and financial trouble and foreign policy.
[00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:14.251]  So these are legitimate, intelligent people who are bidding up the price of oil because of the potential of a war.
[00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:16.333]  I kept saying in the campaign, you know,
[00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:20.350]  If I had my way, they said, well, what would you do immediately if you were elected president?
[00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.111]  I said, I'd bring our troops home and I'd bring our Navy out of the Persian Gulf.
[00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:28.693]  And I said, the dollar would probably go up in value and we would eliminate the risk premium.
[00:13:29.053 --> 00:13:31.674]  Probably oil prices would drop precipitously.
[00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:35.875]  And it would be just by removing this threat.
[00:13:36.365 --> 00:13:39.807]  But, you know, next week, possibly that resolution, H.J.
[00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:40.967]  Res.
[00:13:41.308 --> 00:13:57.556]  362, I believe it is, if that comes up, it is demanding the President put on an absolute blockade of the entire country of Iran and punish any country or any business group around the world if they trade with Iran.
[00:13:58.036 --> 00:14:00.698]  I mean, this is very, very serious business.
[00:14:00.878 --> 00:14:05.140]  And experts are saying we're going to see $6 a gallon gas if that happens immediately.
[00:14:05.737 --> 00:14:06.037]  Right.
[00:14:06.097 --> 00:14:14.486]  I mean, we may get there just by anticipation, but when it happens, and then what if the Iranians are capable of sinking a couple ships out there?
[00:14:15.467 --> 00:14:17.969]  Or if it accidentally happens in the Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:20.111]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:23.094]  But the other thing is, it's risking 150,000 Americans in Iraq.
[00:14:25.484 --> 00:14:28.647]  I mean, do you think they don't know the potential problems coming?
[00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:32.310]  Do you think that they are not working with their allies in Iraq?
[00:14:32.671 --> 00:14:37.335]  I mean, could they blockade and actually squeeze our troops to that point?
[00:14:37.395 --> 00:14:41.058]  I mean, you just can't get enough helicopters to fly these people out of there.
[00:14:41.098 --> 00:14:51.748]  Well, what happens if the neocons launch 2,000 Saudis, as they're saying they'll do, bomb the infrastructure, with Saddam or the U.S.-backed military in that eight
[00:14:53.385 --> 00:15:01.107]  year war, when Iraq was a first world nation, they barely could beat the Iranians, and the Iranians lost a million.
[00:15:01.147 --> 00:15:11.789]  Now the Iranians are built up, to analysts say, about twice the strength they had in the 80s, and they're saying they will overrun and go and do Iraq, and unless the U.S.
[00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:17.570]  uses nukes, they will completely overrun our military, and this is a Custer last stand situation.
[00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:24.538]  Yeah, and the frightening thing is, is they say that they don't, they take no options off the tables, even nuclear first strike.
[00:15:24.618 --> 00:15:39.404]  So, if they're really determined, and they keep pointing out that there are some plans for the Iranians to retaliate, that might give them the argument, well, they might, you know, retaliate, so we better bomb all their military sites.
[00:15:40.124 --> 00:15:44.786]  And these people in the administration are capable of advising
[00:15:45.787 --> 00:15:48.528]  The use of nuclear power, nuclear weapons.
[00:15:48.689 --> 00:16:07.262]  Oh yeah, they've been preparing the public, and you're right, just in the last week, they've gone from, we're probably going to attack Iran too, is it going to happen before the election in November or in between that time when Obama or McCain comes in, January 23rd, and so we're now hearing foregone conclusion.
[00:16:08.022 --> 00:16:10.624]  We only saw that right before the last two Gulf Wars.
[00:16:10.664 --> 00:16:13.106]  I mean, sir, what are you hearing on the Hill?
[00:16:13.146 --> 00:16:14.347]  I mean, has it been green-lighted?
[00:16:15.993 --> 00:16:24.215]  That is my sense, because the Democratic leadership in the House are proposing no resistance whatsoever.
[00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:26.896]  We saw that when this supplemental bill came up.
[00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:32.498]  When the President asked for $107 billion for the war, the Democrat leadership gave him $162 billion.
[00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:33.298]  And they are not resisting it.
[00:16:37.651 --> 00:16:42.316]  The leadership of the Democratic Party is solidly behind this blockade.
[00:16:42.917 --> 00:16:49.164]  They already have 220 members who have signed on the bill, well over the number that they need to pass it.
[00:16:49.624 --> 00:16:53.529]  They're so confident that they think, I imagine they'll bring this up under suspension.
[00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.632]  So no, I think they're very much ready.
[00:16:56.992 --> 00:16:58.374]  But you know, they don't think
[00:16:59.827 --> 00:17:01.828]  Any further than their front of their nose.
[00:17:01.868 --> 00:17:05.468]  I mean, they're not saying, well, could this be like what we did to Iraq?
[00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:06.909]  Could this backfire on us?
[00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:08.969]  They just march right on.
[00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:18.792]  And as long as I've been there, as long as I've studied it, it still is totally bewildering to me when I see men and women in the Congress that I know and like.
[00:17:19.463 --> 00:17:28.485]  And talk with, and I don't think that, you know, they're doing this because they think it's going to materially benefit them.
[00:17:28.745 --> 00:17:32.246]  They just do it to go along, to get along, and they've been convinced.
[00:17:32.266 --> 00:17:41.689]  Most of them will come across and say, oh yes, I agree with you on all you say, but the Iranians are bad people, and they might attack us someday, and we can't let them have it.
[00:17:41.709 --> 00:17:43.529]  They buy into all the propaganda.
[00:17:43.889 --> 00:17:45.690]  They never stop and think about it.
[00:17:46.624 --> 00:17:51.126]  Okay, Congressman, I'm actually, for Internet listeners, going to skip this break coming up right now.
[00:17:51.186 --> 00:17:53.627]  For others, we'll be right back in about three minutes.
[00:17:54.507 --> 00:18:13.155]  Congressman Ron Paul, to me, everything that's happening is so bizarre historically, so obviously World War III-ish, so obviously over-the-top and criminal by this government, and the supine nature, the prostrate nature of the Democrats,
[00:18:14.395 --> 00:18:18.418]  Watching the John Yoo and Addington testimony, the arrogance.
[00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:22.800]  I mean, sometimes I'm pinching myself like this is a bad nightmare, and I mean that literally.
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.962]  I mean, I feel history is happening now.
[00:18:26.302 --> 00:18:30.465]  Do you feel that same, and also intellectually, analyzing this?
[00:18:30.525 --> 00:18:33.126]  I mean, what's your feeling watching this happen?
[00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:39.610]  As we were leading up to the Iraqi war, I described it as being surreal.
[00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.051]  It's like, I'm hearing this,
[00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:42.908]  But I don't believe it's happening.
[00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:47.690]  It's something that you might read in history that people blundered.
[00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.912]  But I'm in the middle of this total blundering, like it can't possibly be true.
[00:18:52.452 --> 00:18:57.915]  And then with the total failure of what we've done over there, they're preparing to expand the war.
[00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:01.497]  We don't even report it anymore.
[00:19:01.917 --> 00:19:08.540]  I consider the election right now between these two individuals have no real difference in their policies.
[00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.173]  As a planned distraction from the real issues.
[00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:15.476]  You know, do they talk about what's happening in Afghanistan?
[00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:17.277]  That place is deteriorating.
[00:19:17.758 --> 00:19:24.063]  And this whole idea, do they ever talk about a million people that were killed since we invaded Iraq?
[00:19:24.644 --> 00:19:31.190]  And do they point out which oil companies are getting no-bid contracts and looking forward to selling more and more oil?
[00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:31.870]  Nope.
[00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.573]  They're talking about, you know what,
[00:19:37.077 --> 00:19:41.558]  Obama said, and what McCain said, and picking away at little statements.
[00:19:41.638 --> 00:19:44.159]  It's just a total distraction from the important issues.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.740]  Well, it certainly is.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.661]  So, 95% chance they're going to go ahead and bombard.
[00:19:52.762 --> 00:19:59.684]  We know some of the public plans about hitting several hundred sites a month or so of attacks, hundreds of Saudis a day.
[00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:09.723]  I mean, are you getting any gauge, because you really studied history, or up there on the hill from intelligence about what Iran will probably do?
[00:20:09.743 --> 00:20:14.484]  Well, I think they're going to do whatever they can.
[00:20:14.624 --> 00:20:16.085]  They're not going to roll over.
[00:20:17.005 --> 00:20:21.826]  And they have more weapons now than they used to have.
[00:20:22.207 --> 00:20:27.788]  I think they're going to do exactly what a lot of us suspected they could do, and that is go after some of our ships.
[00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:30.929]  I believe they are capable of closing the straits of Hormuz.
[00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:34.715]  And that is when the escalation is going to occur.
[00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:44.583]  Then I think, you know, if one of our ships are sunk, it'll be the Gulf of Tonkin thing tenfold over, and the American people will say, boy, well, you can't be a wimp.
[00:20:44.763 --> 00:20:45.884]  You've got to go after them.
[00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:46.805]  Nukem, Nukem.
[00:20:47.005 --> 00:20:49.927]  I hear members of Congress on the floor actually talking that way, yeah.
[00:20:50.468 --> 00:20:52.409]  If we could only nuke them, that would take care of it.
[00:20:52.429 --> 00:20:52.829]  Unbelievable.
[00:20:52.869 --> 00:20:54.351]  Congressman, we're coming back to the full audience.
[00:20:54.391 --> 00:20:54.671]  Here we go.
[00:20:56.842 --> 00:21:04.324]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, we're talking behind the scenes with the Congressman about members of Congress talking about nuking Iran on the floor.
[00:21:04.844 --> 00:21:06.084]  And I've heard them on talk radio.
[00:21:06.124 --> 00:21:10.085]  The talking point from the White House is, we're going to blow their country up.
[00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:14.507]  Water treatment, roads, airports, any infrastructure.
[00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:20.128]  And if they dare fight back in any way, we're going to hit them with tactical nukes all over the country.
[00:21:20.848 --> 00:21:33.756]  How morally are they going to sell, not just to us, but the world, that we're going to attack you when you don't even have any weapons, when you've been groveling to the UN for years, and then if you fight back in any way, we're going to nuke you.
[00:21:33.776 --> 00:21:40.360]  I mean, imagine if Hitler would have had nukes and would have said, I'm going to attack Poland, and if they fight back, I'm going to nuke them.
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.582]  I mean, this is, like you were saying earlier, this is otherworldly.
[00:21:43.622 --> 00:21:44.763]  This is surreal.
[00:21:45.643 --> 00:21:56.573]  Well, to me, the biggest challenge has been, the biggest eye-opener has been in these last several years is how strongly some of our Christian evangelical groups join in.
[00:21:56.733 --> 00:22:00.776]  That is so disturbing to me, and yet they do.
[00:22:00.896 --> 00:22:06.862]  You know, the Christian Zionist groups are urging this on in the name of Christianity.
[00:22:07.322 --> 00:22:10.725]  I mean, they didn't learn the same Christianity that I learned.
[00:22:11.065 --> 00:22:12.687]  I just cannot conceive of this.
[00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:23.102]  And yet there are millions that way that are just pushing, pushing this war and pushing even nuclear weapons in the name of spreading Christian love.
[00:22:23.122 --> 00:22:26.145]  Premeditated mass murder, hit Larian to say the least.
[00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:28.546]  In closing, two final questions.
[00:22:29.287 --> 00:22:30.788]  When are you hearing they're probably going to hit?
[00:22:30.828 --> 00:22:35.411]  We're hearing September, October from people like Ray McGovern and others with the CIA.
[00:22:37.182 --> 00:22:40.624]  Well, I don't think I have any inside information.
[00:22:40.664 --> 00:22:43.086]  It would be just a gut reaction.
[00:22:43.406 --> 00:22:53.373]  I don't think it's going to be before September, but I think it's quite capable of happening before the November election.
[00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:55.695]  A huge October surprise.
[00:22:57.256 --> 00:22:57.837]  It would be.
[00:22:57.857 --> 00:23:02.080]  Of course, it would be maybe a surprise to some others.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.463]  It would be just a shocking reality of something that we weren't able to stop for us.
[00:23:07.216 --> 00:23:09.857]  Yeah, it's like watching World War II come, there's nothing you can do to stop it.
[00:23:10.617 --> 00:23:20.379]  Congressman, the economy, I've had Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner on, head of the New York Business School on, Dr. Paul Craig Robertson, you know, so many others on.
[00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:24.180]  They're all saying total inflationary depression within two and a half years.
[00:23:25.341 --> 00:23:26.181]  What do you say?
[00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:30.402]  Because it looks like things are accelerating right now faster than what their timetables were.
[00:23:31.325 --> 00:23:35.868]  Well, my statement yesterday raised the question that everybody realizes that we're having stagflation.
[00:23:35.908 --> 00:23:37.089]  We are in a downturn.
[00:23:37.329 --> 00:23:41.812]  The government hasn't even admitted that we have a recession, and everybody knows the inflation is roaring.
[00:23:42.313 --> 00:23:49.898]  To me, the only question was, is when are we going to ask the question to admit that we're moving toward an inflationary depression?
[00:23:50.478 --> 00:23:55.562]  And it used to be thought that when you had inflation, you had a vibrant economy, which is not true.
[00:23:56.204 --> 00:24:00.206]  And I think, you know, within six months or a year, we're going to start to sense that.
[00:24:00.286 --> 00:24:05.349]  But once again, I don't say that I know exactly what it will be like in 12 months.
[00:24:05.729 --> 00:24:12.512]  It may slip into this inflationary depression, but we are on the way down.
[00:24:12.552 --> 00:24:13.753]  The inflation is going up.
[00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:15.754]  The dollar will continue to go down.
[00:24:15.814 --> 00:24:17.715]  The economy is going to continue to weaken.
[00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:20.537]  And so far, they're not doing the right things.
[00:24:20.837 --> 00:24:24.401]  So the longer they do the wrong things, the longer this thing will be prolonged.
[00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:28.024]  But it's the right thing for them because it gives the central banks more power control.
[00:24:28.044 --> 00:24:33.248]  Though for the first time, I'm seeing the IMF central banks criticize the Federal Reserve.
[00:24:33.268 --> 00:24:38.433]  Are they getting ready to pin everything on Bernanke when it was Alan Greenspan that engineered all this?
[00:24:39.414 --> 00:24:44.758]  They'll have to have a scapegoat, but they're not going to give up their power, and it may become more international.
[00:24:44.798 --> 00:24:46.960]  I think the power is already international.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:25:03.213]  The fact that we were able to export our inflation for so long was an agreement, I think, with among the central banks, where they were monetizing our debt and prolonging this, but now it's a reversal, and they'll be lining up to pick up the pieces.
[00:25:03.573 --> 00:25:08.236]  He has the New York Times best-selling book out, Revolution, A Manifesto.
[00:25:08.276 --> 00:25:10.477]  We carry it at InfoWars.com.
[00:25:10.497 --> 00:25:10.917]  Discounted.
[00:25:10.937 --> 00:25:11.658]  Hope you'll get it there.
[00:25:12.058 --> 00:25:14.099]  Congressman, thank you for spending time with us.
[00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:16.260]  Say hi to Carol and the rest of the family.
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:22.764]  Have a great Fourth of July, because on this special holiday, we'll be thinking about you, and you certainly deserve some time off.
[00:25:22.784 --> 00:25:23.524]  God bless you, sir.
[00:25:23.925 --> 00:25:24.525]  Thank you very much.
[00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:24.965]  Bye-bye.
[00:25:25.285 --> 00:25:27.867]  There goes Congressman Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:28.447 --> 00:25:29.047]  Stay with us.
[00:25:29.067 --> 00:25:30.088]  You know who's straight ahead?
[00:25:30.808 --> 00:25:31.509]  You'll find out.
[00:25:35.772 --> 00:25:37.313]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:25:38.474 --> 00:25:39.695]  ...ending up to pick up the pieces.
[00:25:40.115 --> 00:25:45.779]  He ha- The Geises- ...radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:25:46.139 --> 00:25:48.461]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:50.902]  It is July 3rd, 2008.
[00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:12.114]  We're going to be live here for another hour and fifty minutes.
[00:26:12.214 --> 00:26:15.297]  David Eichel will be with us into the middle of the next hour.
[00:26:16.078 --> 00:26:20.422]  He really doesn't need any introduction and I'm very pleased that he'll spend time with us today.
[00:26:20.442 --> 00:26:21.083]  He's very busy.
[00:26:21.703 --> 00:26:24.826]  He's running for Parliament right now.
[00:26:25.086 --> 00:26:28.990]  He has been the head of the Green Party previously in England.
[00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.852]  He, of course, is a championship goalie.
[00:26:32.193 --> 00:26:39.616]  You know, in the Big International League, he also, of course, was a big presenter, one of the top presenters on the sports on BBC.
[00:26:40.236 --> 00:26:44.918]  What a life he has led, and he is the author of scores of best-selling books.
[00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:53.402]  I agree with about 99% of what David Ogg has to say, and now I've got to sometimes say, as weird as things are, who knows the other 1% might be right.
[00:26:53.742 --> 00:26:55.823]  I mean, we're on a planet hurtling through space, and
[00:26:56.503 --> 00:27:03.909]  God only knows, and so I really respect him, I appreciate him, and he's just a great speaker and a very interesting mind, riveting individual.
[00:27:04.369 --> 00:27:10.373]  And so he wants to first talk about this election, and then I want to get into where he sees things going in the next few years.
[00:27:10.413 --> 00:27:12.735]  He's made predictions before and they've come true, unfortunately.
[00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:18.980]  What he's forecasting in the next five to ten years, what he's forecasting in the short term with Iran, how he thinks
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.962]  This is going to play out with the forces of good and evil, where he thinks mankind is going.
[00:27:25.002 --> 00:27:29.063]  A conversation with David Icke, and of course his website is DavidIcke.com.
[00:27:29.104 --> 00:27:34.846]  He has many others, and we have links to those up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:35.126 --> 00:27:36.846]  David Icke, thank you for spending time with us.
[00:27:37.447 --> 00:27:37.947]  Pleasure, Alex.
[00:27:39.047 --> 00:27:39.867]  You've got the floor.
[00:27:39.907 --> 00:27:41.048]  Talk about whatever you'd like, sir.
[00:27:41.892 --> 00:27:49.016]  Well, it's kind of interesting, just in the last hour I'm looking at some of the things that are happening around me here.
[00:27:49.436 --> 00:28:01.663]  What happened was that a guy called David Davis, who's a Conservative Member of Parliament, they're in the opposition here to the Labour government, he was the Home Affairs spokesman.
[00:28:02.504 --> 00:28:06.746]  And when the Labour government forced through with outrageous manipulation,
[00:28:07.575 --> 00:28:08.036]  I think?
[00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:35.771]  He was going to resign his seat and he was going to stand again in his constituency and seek re-election on the issue, totally one issue, of the Big Brother State in Britain.
[00:28:36.852 --> 00:28:42.635]  Yeah, he said that the police state and the cameras was to oppress, that the government was out of control, unprecedented.
[00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:50.961]  Yeah, and it was unprecedented from whichever angle you look at it, this man doing this.
[00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:59.586]  Obviously, you put him on the back burner and you see how this plays out, this guy David Davis.
[00:29:00.046 --> 00:29:05.570]  Anyway, I'm watching the news one night a couple of weeks ago.
[00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:14.632]  And it's clear that the Labour Party is not going to put up a candidate against him, because they say the election is a farce.
[00:29:14.852 --> 00:29:20.474]  For that, put it through the translation decoder, we would get slaughtered, and here's our excuse not to.
[00:29:20.494 --> 00:29:29.316]  The other major party in Britain, the Liberal Democrats, are not standing against him because they say they agree with what he's doing, and so basically he's on his own.
[00:29:29.356 --> 00:29:31.277]  So I thought, well, okay, I'll stand.
[00:29:31.757 --> 00:29:32.857]  And I'll stand for two reasons.
[00:29:33.637 --> 00:29:49.124]  One, to have a debate with him about the Big Brother State, and two, to point out, and this is the major point, that it is not just the arrogant, authoritarian Labour government in this country that's bringing in the Big Brother State.
[00:29:49.444 --> 00:29:51.825]  It's global, and it doesn't just include...
[00:29:52.525 --> 00:29:54.766]  Surveillance cameras and DNA databases.
[00:29:55.226 --> 00:29:59.388]  It's a whole tapestry of interconnected change.
[00:29:59.508 --> 00:30:02.930]  Everything from the European Union to the War on Terror.
[00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.651]  Well take Texas and other states.
[00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:14.536]  They're passing laws that the computer repairman, by the way he's not paid by the government to do this, must snoop through your computer and have a law enforcement degree to repair computers.
[00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:17.217]  Not even a pretense of a fourth amendment
[00:30:17.697 --> 00:30:18.398]  Or privacy.
[00:30:18.418 --> 00:30:20.700]  They're training all the children publicly in the U.S.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.244]  and in England now to spy on their parents.
[00:30:24.584 --> 00:30:27.387]  I mean, it's like everything has gone into warp drive.
[00:30:28.428 --> 00:30:29.470]  Exactly, it has.
[00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:38.219]  And, you know, the point I've been making, since I started to decide to stand,
[00:30:38.719 --> 00:30:42.822]  With this very point, it's happening in every country.
[00:30:42.882 --> 00:30:45.303]  So how on earth can it just be the Labour government?
[00:30:45.363 --> 00:30:48.705]  And the reason I'm standing here... Well the programs even have the same names!
[00:30:49.486 --> 00:30:49.946]  Exactly.
[00:30:50.346 --> 00:31:00.252]  So I'm standing here to use the platform and get what mainstream media coverage I can as they cover these things like by-elections to get this point across.
[00:31:00.312 --> 00:31:01.333]  And I'm going on the line
[00:31:02.003 --> 00:31:03.965]  Big Brother, the big picture.
[00:31:04.666 --> 00:31:15.235]  But what then starts to emerge is that people that are coming up to this constituency to support David Davis and are on his website.
[00:31:15.255 --> 00:31:18.558]  Yeah, he's coming up to support me in opposing Big Brother.
[00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:21.781]  Well, there are some very strange bedfellows this guy's got.
[00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:23.583]  First of all, there's a guy coming up here.
[00:31:24.395 --> 00:31:24.896]  We're good.
[00:31:46.517 --> 00:31:50.719]  Sir Richard Dearlove, head of MI6 from 1999 to 2004.
[00:31:50.799 --> 00:32:02.406]  Erwin Steltzer, former managing director of the Rothschilds Bank, now living in London, US economist, a contributor to the Weekly Standard, of course, Murdoch's neocon rag.
[00:32:02.426 --> 00:32:07.709]  So they're trying to co-opt the revolution against tyranny, they know they can't stop it, so they're trying to pre-empt it.
[00:32:07.729 --> 00:32:09.550]  So you're pre-empting, they're pre-empting.
[00:32:10.134 --> 00:32:24.718]  Well, yeah, it's becoming clear what this scam here that I'm in the middle of here is about now, because he was also a resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute, and now he's with the Hudson Institute.
[00:32:24.758 --> 00:32:33.480]  Of course, now we're starting to talk major neocon organizations that were orchestrators and propagandists for the war on terror, but it goes further.
[00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:46.020]  International patrons for the Henry Jackson Society of this guy who's coming to support David Davis against Big Brother include Richard Perle, one of the major architects.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.541]  The Prince of Darkness!
[00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:48.721]  The Prince of Darkness.
[00:32:49.001 --> 00:32:53.302]  William Crystal, co-founder of the Project for the New American Century.
[00:32:53.582 --> 00:32:57.342]  James Woolsey, former head of the CIA and neocon.
[00:32:57.422 --> 00:32:59.743]  That's all the head neocons you just listed.
[00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:01.554]  We're good to go.
[00:33:15.575 --> 00:33:19.477]  With Norman Dodds, found out, was actually manipulating war.
[00:33:19.817 --> 00:33:28.401]  He's the senior speech writer for George Shultz, one of the major manipulators behind the scenes in the United States when he was Secretary of State.
[00:33:28.421 --> 00:33:31.062]  He's still a top Kingmaker, yes.
[00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:32.222]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:32.242 --> 00:33:36.504]  These are the people who are connected to this organization.
[00:33:37.205 --> 00:33:41.246]  And this guy, Ed Vasey, who's coming up to support David Davis to fight Big Brother.
[00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:44.748]  And there's another guy coming up called Patrick Mercer, MP.
[00:33:45.647 --> 00:33:48.667]  He's a consultant for something called Blue Hackle.
[00:33:49.238 --> 00:33:52.861]  Which is a security firm, akin to Blackwater, that kind of operation.
[00:33:52.881 --> 00:33:53.601]  Yeah, private mercs.
[00:33:53.621 --> 00:33:59.446]  Let me stop you, David, because a lot of Americans, people in the U.S., don't know the British nomenclature for elections.
[00:33:59.546 --> 00:34:07.532]  By standing, that means you're running for his seat, he's pulling back in this stunt, you know, to claim he's running from outside to come in and fix things.
[00:34:08.092 --> 00:34:11.474]  And it's not like he's just signed on to a group that has some neocons on it.
[00:34:11.755 --> 00:34:15.417]  They're coming to his district to push and campaign for him.
[00:34:15.698 --> 00:34:17.099]  That's what you mean by coming up.
[00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.160]  Yes, I'm coming up to this constituency where I'm sitting in the middle of it now.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.800]  Exactly.
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:27.242]  The neocons are actively flocking in to this area of England to push this guy actively.
[00:34:27.262 --> 00:34:27.662]  Go ahead.
[00:34:28.082 --> 00:34:28.502]  Exactly.
[00:34:28.782 --> 00:34:33.204]  Patrick Mercer MP is also sponsored by something called the Heart Group.
[00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:34.404]  Now this is a guy
[00:34:35.184 --> 00:34:40.628]  Just to confirm again, who's coming up to support the challenge to Big Brother?
[00:34:40.968 --> 00:34:52.435]  Well, this Hart Group that sponsors this Patrick Mercer produces electronic passports, border control systems for security, vehicle registration and tracking, biometric identification systems, etc, etc.
[00:34:53.849 --> 00:34:56.531]  And it's very clear that you know what it's like, Alex.
[00:34:56.671 --> 00:35:14.543]  If you have an awareness starting to express itself, an understanding of some of what's going on, you want to put your people in there to become the focus and therefore control and direct or misdirect that gathering awareness.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:22.244]  It's clear, as I'm up here going through this election, which I don't want to win, of course.
[00:35:22.384 --> 00:35:24.786]  It's a waste of time going to Parliament.
[00:35:24.846 --> 00:35:26.047]  But you have to, David.
[00:35:26.087 --> 00:35:26.988]  I mean, you have to win.
[00:35:27.048 --> 00:35:27.708]  I don't want to win.
[00:35:27.828 --> 00:35:36.675]  I don't want to win because what it will do is catch me in the web, which will stop me doing all the other things that I need to do that are far more important.
[00:35:36.695 --> 00:35:38.936]  Well, I mean, I understand, but have you calculated?
[00:35:38.996 --> 00:35:42.059]  I mean, is this going to hurt who he's running against more than it hurts him?
[00:35:44.061 --> 00:35:44.561]  He'll win.
[00:35:44.981 --> 00:35:46.102]  He'll win easily.
[00:35:46.583 --> 00:35:47.944]  But you're just educating people.
[00:35:47.964 --> 00:35:52.607]  But to be clear, what they're doing here is... Do you agree?
[00:35:52.627 --> 00:35:53.508]  This is what he'll do then.
[00:35:54.489 --> 00:36:06.518]  He'll say, look, I'm against Big Brother, what we need is this, and it'll be worse Big Brother, but they'll label that as anti-Big Brother, and then he'll be the savior, and only give you the good ID cards that are safe.
[00:36:07.359 --> 00:36:11.162]  Yeah, and the other thing that is happening, and it's already happened, is because he's done this,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.990]  He's now the man the British media go to if ever a Big Brother type story breaks.
[00:36:26.508 --> 00:36:26.868]  I don't
[00:36:43.144 --> 00:36:43.524]  Yes.
[00:36:43.545 --> 00:36:43.845]  So he is...
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:07.483]  He has absolutely point-blank refused to debate with me, a fellow candidate in this election.
[00:37:07.963 --> 00:37:08.403]  Amazing.
[00:37:08.663 --> 00:37:13.466]  So bottom line, he is a change agent masquerading as the alternative.
[00:37:13.726 --> 00:37:15.347]  He is controlled opposition.
[00:37:15.947 --> 00:37:19.249]  There's a very good chance that that is what this game is about.
[00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:20.130]  Well, there's no doubt.
[00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:31.057]  If you've got every top neocon, the inner circle of global neocon power, coming to his district to campaign for him because he's fighting the New World Order, I mean, this is incredibly obvious.
[00:37:31.317 --> 00:37:35.660]  We're going to do a behind-the-scenes discussion for PrisonPlanet.tv and internet listeners right now.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.321]  We'll be back for everybody else in just a few minutes.
[00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:38.202]  Stay with us.
[00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:38.642]  David Icke.
[00:37:40.684 --> 00:37:41.744]  Alright.
[00:37:41.784 --> 00:37:42.045]  David?
[00:37:42.793 --> 00:37:43.173]  Yes Mike.
[00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:51.782]  What I'm doing now is with a really big guest is I just skipped the breaks for the internet audience so we don't waste any time and we'll come back and get into other issues in just a few minutes.
[00:37:53.463 --> 00:37:57.447]  But we will take the bottom of the hour break in about ten minutes so you'll have a break then.
[00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:06.696]  Why don't you right now, we'll do this before you leave on the full show, tell us about some of the websites, some of the things you're working on right now, some of the new books and videos.
[00:38:10.707 --> 00:38:12.109]  I'll go ahead and tell us about that now, David.
[00:38:12.549 --> 00:38:22.298]  Okay, what's happened since 9-11 particularly, but certainly in the last couple of years, there's been an explosion of interest in this whole information that I'm putting out.
[00:38:22.979 --> 00:38:32.248]  And when I finish with this election, I'm going to speak in Croatia, in Romania, in Italy, then I'm coming to America to speak in Santa Clara last weekend in September.
[00:38:34.424 --> 00:38:42.346]  A DVD coming out in seven hours of what I did to 2,500 people in London at the Brixton Academy a few weeks ago.
[00:38:42.706 --> 00:38:56.390]  There's another interesting video coming out in two hours for people who are new to this, which is a presentation I did to the Oxford Union about six weeks ago at Oxford University, and it's interesting.
[00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:01.171]  When you're talking to closed minds as opposed to open minds, how
[00:39:01.997 --> 00:39:07.822]  People of supposedly top intellect at one of the leading universes in the world.
[00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:10.004]  Honestly, they're babes in arms.
[00:39:10.284 --> 00:39:13.066]  They're babes in arms when it comes to the world as it really is.
[00:39:14.707 --> 00:39:16.129]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:18.871]  What was the difference?
[00:39:19.111 --> 00:39:29.680]  I mean, a few palpable examples of talking to the educated idiots who are in this small, sequestered world looking at the universe through a straw versus talking to open-minded people.
[00:39:31.038 --> 00:39:32.379]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:39:32.399 --> 00:39:43.707]  The more that I've traveled this journey, of course, the more subjects I've realized you've got to get some kind of understanding of to appreciate how all the pieces fit.
[00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:47.130]  And one area is the way the brain works.
[00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:51.533]  You know, there are two sides to the brain, two hemispheres of the brain.
[00:39:51.873 --> 00:39:53.674]  The right brain is the creative.
[00:39:53.714 --> 00:39:54.555]  It's the out there.
[00:39:54.615 --> 00:39:55.816]  It can see connections.
[00:39:56.516 --> 00:39:57.477]  It can think in a
[00:39:58.237 --> 00:39:58.577]  I think?
[00:40:27.262 --> 00:40:33.564]  You have to take information into the left brain overwhelmingly, because it's all about mathematics and language.
[00:40:33.604 --> 00:40:37.225]  That's the German-Prussian model of 200 years ago.
[00:40:37.705 --> 00:40:44.467]  The modern education model based on that was about keeping you only in the left brain, where it's basically regurgitation.
[00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.970]  Yes, exactly.
[00:40:46.291 --> 00:41:02.212]  And so if you analyze the system, you go through school, and if you're very good at taking in left brain information, holding it, and then regurgitating it out on an exam paper, then you progress into university and what have you, and you do the same again at a higher level.
[00:41:02.652 --> 00:41:24.504]  You then choose your specialization, medicine, science, whatever, and you do the same again at a higher level in your specialized... And you're like specialized insects who were sequestered, perfect to be inserted into the Illuminati compartmentalized pyramid, whereas you have the artist's free-thinking, truly creative mind, which has always been the enemy of the New World Order.
[00:41:25.134 --> 00:41:25.434]  Right.
[00:41:25.814 --> 00:41:44.084]  And if you look at, therefore, that the system and the way it brings its people to the top of its various pyramids to run its institutions, they are people who have been very, very good at taking in left-brain information and regurgitating it out on an exam paper.
[00:41:44.124 --> 00:41:45.444]  In other words, they are... Amazing!
[00:41:45.484 --> 00:41:47.565]  Tell you what, we're coming back to the main audience, David.
[00:41:47.585 --> 00:41:48.466]  Here we go, main audience.
[00:41:52.546 --> 00:41:59.531]  Boy, folks listening on InfoWars.com and watching on PrisonPlanet.tv just heard David totally switch into left-right brain science.
[00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:02.193]  Restate that without me interrupting, David.
[00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:12.280]  Break down the left-right, and I've read the research, you're absolutely accurate in what you're saying for people, and how this Illuminati pyramid goes after certain compartmentalized, shuttered individuals.
[00:42:12.641 --> 00:42:21.487]  Like, you'll talk to globalists and you'll find out they're compartmentalized and have been selected because like a specialized insect in an anthill, they carry out
[00:42:21.767 --> 00:42:24.328]  A specific function, which has totally left brain.
[00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:30.932]  Yeah, once I began to understand how the brain works, society started to make real sense to me.
[00:42:31.772 --> 00:42:33.913]  Because we have two hemispheres of the brain.
[00:42:33.933 --> 00:42:38.996]  There's the right brain, which is the creative, it's the out there, it's the maverick, it's the free thinking.
[00:42:39.476 --> 00:42:41.917]  It's that which will not be imprisoned.
[00:42:42.317 --> 00:42:49.461]  It's that which can see connections between things, and not just see everything as divided and apart.
[00:42:50.081 --> 00:43:04.368]  Now, the left brain really helps us function in this world, because it's about language, it's about structure, it's about the world of the five senses, if you like, and it's important.
[00:43:04.428 --> 00:43:13.452]  You know, we need whole-brain people, because if you're only right-brained, we all know people like that, they're very creative, but they can't function in this world.
[00:43:13.912 --> 00:43:20.701]  But there's another extreme, which is becoming a left brain prisoner, which I have to say is where most people are, particularly those that run the system.
[00:43:21.382 --> 00:43:22.764]  And if you're in the left brain,
[00:43:23.602 --> 00:43:33.948]  You're just dealing with five-sense reality, which is a fraction of what there is to understand, and certainly a fraction of what there is to express yourself.
[00:43:34.668 --> 00:43:48.116]  And the system is designed to lock people in that tiny left-brain reality, and they do it, not least through the bravely entitled education system, because as you go through school,
[00:43:48.836 --> 00:43:49.497]  What are you doing?
[00:43:49.517 --> 00:43:58.001]  You're taking in left brain information, hold it, and now give it me back on an exam paper, tell the system what it's told you, and then you progress.
[00:43:58.841 --> 00:44:00.542]  Because you're very successful at school.
[00:44:00.702 --> 00:44:02.423]  That's basic programming.
[00:44:03.043 --> 00:44:04.184]  Programming, yes it is.
[00:44:04.424 --> 00:44:14.249]  I mean, it's interesting, you know, Alex, that when you go through a secret society, you go up through degrees, and then when you, you know, you go to university, you get a degree.
[00:44:14.269 --> 00:44:16.970]  Well, it's a degree of programming to a very large extent.
[00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:39.304]  So you go to university from school, you go through the same process of taking in left brain information and putting it out on an exam paper, you then choose your specialization of medicine, of whatever it is, science, law, all of these things, and then you go through your specialization and to pass those exams you do the same again.
[00:44:39.645 --> 00:44:43.327]  So what you've been doing all your formative life
[00:44:44.039 --> 00:44:44.199]  I think?
[00:45:01.435 --> 00:45:17.207]  And so, the system is run by left-brain prisoners who are operating with a fraction of their potential of understanding reality and creativity, and therefore we live in a left-brain society.
[00:45:17.668 --> 00:45:25.974]  And it's interesting, again, you know, when you understand these things, you start to see the significance of apparently things that are not connected.
[00:45:26.955 --> 00:45:41.458]  The British government a few months ago announced that it was going to introduce 500 tests, intellectual type tests, for preschool children.
[00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:47.068]  And the teachers were saying, hold on a minute, when are the kids going to have time to play?
[00:45:47.428 --> 00:45:49.030]  They don't want them to play.
[00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:52.394]  Let me stop you.
[00:45:52.975 --> 00:45:56.559]  Here in the U.S., and I don't know about England, they have banned dodgeball.
[00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:58.221]  Then it was play, then it was tag.
[00:45:58.261 --> 00:45:59.803]  Now they're just getting rid of recess.
[00:46:01.324 --> 00:46:06.287]  And again, they want to keep you in that left brain, as the Prussians discovered over a hundred years ago.
[00:46:06.987 --> 00:46:15.111]  Their own documents, as you know, David, I'm sure you've seen them, say that they don't ever want you to relax or have time to think or daydream or have a philosophic.
[00:46:15.391 --> 00:46:20.334]  It's all just machines compartmentalizing the mind with the seven periods.
[00:46:20.934 --> 00:46:21.795]  That's absolutely right.
[00:46:21.835 --> 00:46:23.756]  Daydreaming is a very, very important point.
[00:46:24.136 --> 00:46:26.758]  Daydreaming is a right brain genome.
[00:46:26.818 --> 00:46:33.662]  Well, it's also a communion between the cerebral cortex, the left and right, and the subconscious, which is the larger, more powerful system.
[00:46:34.654 --> 00:46:44.722]  Yeah, so what they want to do is lock people into left-brain reality, because it's basically putting them into a reality bubble, what I call the eggshell.
[00:46:45.282 --> 00:46:58.452]  And when I went to Oxford University, of course, if you're very, very good at this left-brain give-it-me-and-I'll-give-it-you-back-on-an-exam-paper, you are considered in this left-brain, bewildered world.
[00:46:58.952 --> 00:47:02.053]  To be a kind of intellectual genius.
[00:47:02.093 --> 00:47:06.434]  These are the people who are professors at universities, who are teaching the next generation.
[00:47:07.154 --> 00:47:11.015]  When I went to talk at Oxford University, it was extraordinary.
[00:47:11.935 --> 00:47:18.396]  The concrete minds that you see, who are perceived by society to be... David Icke, we got a break.
[00:47:18.496 --> 00:47:18.996]  Stay there.
[00:47:19.096 --> 00:47:19.396]  Stay there.
[00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:19.956]  Three minute break.
[00:47:19.976 --> 00:47:20.617]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:21.177]  Get into this.
[00:47:21.537 --> 00:47:24.497]  Then get into the big picture, the end game with David Icke.
[00:47:24.617 --> 00:47:25.418]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:25.498 --> 00:47:26.478]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:26.498 --> 00:47:26.878]  Stay with us.
[00:47:31.374 --> 00:47:32.314]  We're on the march.
[00:47:32.775 --> 00:47:34.375]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:47:35.295 --> 00:47:38.076]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:41.838 --> 00:47:43.498]  Life has changed.
[00:47:43.898 --> 00:47:45.359]  We're not 21 anymore.
[00:47:45.739 --> 00:47:47.479]  We have responsibilities.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.381]  That's why there's drinkin' made hangover defense.
[00:47:51.841 --> 00:47:53.441]  Sure, we've done our share of partying.
[00:47:53.521 --> 00:47:54.262]  Yeah, dude.
[00:47:54.322 --> 00:47:57.843]  Now, kickin' back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:03.892]  Well, let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[00:48:04.813 --> 00:48:09.454]  With Drink and Mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[00:48:09.795 --> 00:48:20.979]  Drink and Mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[00:48:21.499 --> 00:48:25.061]  Just dissolve one Drink and Mate in water and take it before bed.
[00:48:25.341 --> 00:48:25.941]  It's that easy.
[00:48:26.812 --> 00:48:29.133]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities!
[00:48:30.713 --> 00:48:34.194]  Drink and Mate Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[00:48:34.554 --> 00:48:35.394]  Pick up some today!
[00:48:36.215 --> 00:48:39.096]  Remember your Drink and Mate, and wake up feeling great!
[00:48:40.596 --> 00:48:41.996]  It is a big idea.
[00:48:42.016 --> 00:48:44.117]  A new world order.
[00:48:44.837 --> 00:48:49.138]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:48:49.699 --> 00:48:51.839]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[00:48:52.559 --> 00:48:54.700]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:48:55.325 --> 00:48:57.768]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:48:58.509 --> 00:49:05.839]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:13.823]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:49:14.304 --> 00:49:17.786]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:49:18.166 --> 00:49:20.648]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:49:20.748 --> 00:49:21.889]  Most people have no idea.
[00:49:21.909 --> 00:49:22.669]  They're not after money.
[00:49:22.689 --> 00:49:23.790]  They have all the money they need.
[00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:24.571]  They're after power.
[00:49:24.591 --> 00:49:25.791]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:47.383]  Hoods Woods is the world leader in survival instructional videos.
[00:49:47.483 --> 00:49:56.630]  Hoods Woods produces an outstanding collection of survival DVDs, from cave cooking to survival basics to home survival DVDs, covering topics such as food storage and home
[00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:57.111]  We're good.
[00:50:11.727 --> 00:50:12.488]  We're good to go.
[00:51:04.296 --> 00:51:07.378]  DavidIke.com, just Google his name.
[00:51:08.567 --> 00:51:31.157]  Dave, before we get back into these educated idiots or, like, insects, highly specialized individuals who are only in their little discipline and fit nicely into the New World Order Illuminati power pyramid, into their place for the Master Queen Bee up at the top, you've got a lot of websites, a lot of books, a lot of videos.
[00:51:32.257 --> 00:51:36.059]  Tell folks where they should go to find out more about those books and videos and materials.
[00:51:36.724 --> 00:51:38.706]  Well, DavidIke.com is the center of it.
[00:51:39.566 --> 00:51:40.107]  Really, Alex?
[00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:45.552]  So if people go there, they'll be able to get all of them.
[00:51:45.972 --> 00:51:51.717]  I've written about 16 books overall, and it's been a journey like it has for you.
[00:51:51.817 --> 00:52:02.026]  It's been a journey of seeing that something wasn't right, and then as you keep walking, the path just gets bigger and the information gets bigger and the picture gets bigger.
[00:52:02.871 --> 00:52:12.693]  And so, you know, we've reached this point today where we've now at last started to get some kind of real fix on the scale of this, and therefore we have a chance of turning it around.
[00:52:13.113 --> 00:52:31.718]  Sure, let's go ahead and get back and finish up your story about talking to just the general public, much more open-minded, much more intelligent, much, you know, just on the facts, people who know about the New World Order are really into info, wide-ranging analysis of different disciplines, versus these specialized New World Order minions.
[00:52:32.578 --> 00:52:37.759]  Yeah, what we've got to do, Alex, is we've got to re-evaluate our understanding of intelligence.
[00:52:38.259 --> 00:52:44.380]  You know, cleverness is not wisdom, and cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on Earth.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:55.662]  And what happens with left-brain-dominated... ...cleverness, in terms of technology and stuff like that... David, let me stop you.
[00:52:55.742 --> 00:52:59.083]  I think the cord to your phone may be loose because we're losing your audio.
[00:52:59.103 --> 00:52:59.803]  Can you check that?
[00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:04.231]  Yeah, it's a hotel phone, I should complain.
[00:53:04.751 --> 00:53:11.732]  I would imagine that you're walking around and when it's tugging... No, no, I'm sitting perfectly still.
[00:53:11.812 --> 00:53:13.893]  I'm coming and going.
[00:53:14.473 --> 00:53:15.473]  Start over, start over.
[00:53:15.533 --> 00:53:16.974]  Go back to what you were saying.
[00:53:17.214 --> 00:53:22.495]  When you have these individuals, you were saying cleverness is not wisdom.
[00:53:23.157 --> 00:53:35.804]  Yeah, cleverness without wisdom is the most destructive force on Earth, because without the balance of wisdom, cleverness can just, you know, go wild and create infinite death and destruction.
[00:53:35.844 --> 00:53:43.168]  I mean, it's very, very clever to know how to create an atomic bomb, but it's not wise to do so, especially not to use it.
[00:53:43.668 --> 00:53:46.830]  And so we've got these left-brain prisoners running the system,
[00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:54.897]  Who are clever, well some of them are, some of them are bloody stupid, but clever, but they don't have the balance of wisdom.
[00:53:55.297 --> 00:54:05.586]  And intelligence is not just being able to remember, you know, what size shoes the Normans took in the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
[00:54:05.746 --> 00:54:13.492]  It's being able to see things that less intelligent people can't see.
[00:54:13.752 --> 00:54:15.434]  And I'll give you an example of the difference.
[00:54:15.994 --> 00:54:31.997]  I spoke at the Brixton Academy in London to two and a half thousand people about a month ago, and in that audience was every race, every income bracket, every range of society aged the lot.
[00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:39.559]  And I gave them everything I could give them, because the reason they were there is they had open-minded intelligence.
[00:54:40.019 --> 00:54:44.020]  But when I spoke to these, quote, brilliant students at Oxford University,
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:51.268]  I'm sitting in the hotel room in the afternoon thinking, how do I put this in baby steps so these people have any chance of getting it?
[00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:59.037]  It's because we have misunderstood what intelligence is, and intelligence is not just
[00:54:59.697 --> 00:55:00.398]  I agree.
[00:55:00.438 --> 00:55:03.140]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.942]  Let me bring forward an example of what I think of as wisdom.
[00:55:05.982 --> 00:55:06.122]  Exactly.
[00:55:06.142 --> 00:55:07.743]  They can come up with a GMO food
[00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:25.475]  Now that makes some huge profits and corners the market on food, and that would be clever, but did they with wisdom think about what that will even do to their own grandchildren?
[00:55:25.935 --> 00:55:26.216]  No!
[00:55:26.676 --> 00:55:36.962]  These clever, wicked people, they just do it because they can in this mad, almost instinctive race to have power, to dominate, to control.
[00:55:37.022 --> 00:55:39.264]  The rationale is, well if I don't do it,
[00:55:40.204 --> 00:55:51.249]  Somebody else will, but also wisdom really is about being tied into the human journey, the human species, realizing we're all connected and not being selfish.
[00:55:51.269 --> 00:56:04.995]  I mean, they're clever to have power, but they're also blinded in that they think they really are disconnected from the rest of reality, when really, when some soldier rapes and kills a child, they're raping and killing their own soul.
[00:56:17.387 --> 00:56:18.747]  David, I've got to stop you again.
[00:56:19.048 --> 00:56:20.288]  Can you wiggle that cord?
[00:56:20.748 --> 00:56:21.368]  David, stop.
[00:56:22.229 --> 00:56:25.990]  I need you to wiggle that cord in that phone or we may have to reconnect with you.
[00:56:28.447 --> 00:56:31.469]  Well, when we have a break, I'll try the other phone on the other side of the room.
[00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:32.730]  That's what we'll do.
[00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:33.230]  That's perfect.
[00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:35.231]  We'll call you on the other phone.
[00:56:35.311 --> 00:56:36.252]  Okay, you're back now.
[00:56:36.272 --> 00:56:38.173]  I can barely hear you say Einstein.
[00:56:38.693 --> 00:56:38.934]  Yeah.
[00:56:39.214 --> 00:56:45.758]  What they're saying is that Einstein said that you cannot solve problems with the same level of consciousness that created them.
[00:56:46.218 --> 00:56:48.479]  And that's what we're constantly trying to do.
[00:56:48.559 --> 00:56:50.661]  And that's why, you know, you replace
[00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:51.621]  I think?
[00:57:21.403 --> 00:57:22.484]  I don't think so.
[00:57:51.929 --> 00:58:10.200]  Now, I want to shift gears into currently what's happening with Iran, why the globalists are revaluing the dollar, why they're preparing to bring us into a world crisis as the springboard to the next level, what things will look like if the Illuminists and their controllers are able to build their
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:23.487]  Their world, so seeing it from their perspective, their view, what they want, this cold-blooded view, versus what freedom and love and liberty and the human revolution.
[00:58:23.527 --> 00:58:37.696]  We see these two different revolutions, the tyrant's revolution for global domination, to have the final revolution of total dehumanization, global extermination of 90% of the world's population, versus this
[00:58:38.436 --> 00:58:39.497]  Yeah, it's like the irresistible force.
[00:59:05.347 --> 00:59:06.167]  I don't think so.
[00:59:26.401 --> 00:59:43.158]  You know, I've been saying in this election campaign, just bringing it down to a basic level, you know, that we've had people in this country fine hundreds of pounds for putting their wheelie trash bin out on the wrong day, according to the council's data that says they should put it out.
[00:59:43.218 --> 00:59:44.499]  And they spy on your trash.
[00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:47.482]  We have to start saying, no, I'm not going to go along with this.
[00:59:47.522 --> 00:59:47.803]  Go ahead.
[00:59:48.948 --> 01:00:00.619]  We had a guy in the last week here who was fined £100 by a council for putting a card in his own car saying it was for sale.
[01:00:00.959 --> 01:00:07.445]  He was charged with trading in the street because he parked it somewhere to go to a shop.
[01:00:08.285 --> 01:00:29.036]  Now, if we just allow that to happen and say, oh, that's terrible, isn't it ridiculous, what's the world coming to, then we're going to walk straight into this prison cell that we can't see the bars, well, most people can't see the bars, although they're beginning to, and the door's going to click shut, and then we're going to say, oh, hold a second, we're in a cell, what do we do?
[01:00:29.076 --> 01:00:30.437]  Well, it's going to be a bit bloody late then.
[01:00:30.997 --> 01:00:41.501]  What we need to do now is to have a non-violent, absolutely non-violent, non-cooperation campaign with the system that's enslaving us.
[01:00:41.781 --> 01:00:51.644]  You know, if someone's fined for putting a wheelie bin out on the wrong day, then hundreds and thousands of people need to put their wheelie bin out on the wrong day, indefinitely, until the laws change.
[01:00:51.864 --> 01:00:55.926]  People need to go around with cards in their cars, with adverts on, until the laws change.
[01:00:57.066 --> 01:01:00.490]  This is the only way we're going to do it, because politicians aren't going to change it.
[01:01:00.851 --> 01:01:07.758]  Politicians are told how to vote, because they want to progressively... No, they've got the big think tanks and the party heads manage them.
[01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:08.760]  I wanted to bring this up.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.646]  Two years ago I was in England, two and a half years ago, right after the London bombing, for Terror Storm, my film.
[01:01:15.527 --> 01:01:26.976]  And the police, when I was being quiet, I'd be standing there videotaping somewhere in London, or outside London, and cops would walk over and say, I'm putting you in a database, you're not allowed to videotape in this country.
[01:01:28.277 --> 01:01:32.020]  I'd be talking to crowds of people, they'd walk over and say, you're not allowed to talk to people.
[01:01:33.121 --> 01:01:35.963]  And it was before they banned protest around Parliament.
[01:01:36.263 --> 01:01:58.297]  It was about a week later they did, and they just said, we don't care, you're not allowed to be here, no law, and now they're even coming up to mainline reporters, and how did they get these police, these bobbies, to with pleasure come over, and now it's in the British News, they harass everyone, even mainline reporters, they tell people don't talk to others in the streets, I mean, this is worse than East Germany, and it just happened overnight, David.
[01:01:59.033 --> 01:02:05.584]  Yeah, well I had a, shall we say, an animated discussion with some policemen when I was filming a television program.
[01:02:05.985 --> 01:02:09.872]  I was in Parliament and they came over to me and said, excuse me, have you got permission?
[01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:10.513]  I said, what permission?
[01:02:10.533 --> 01:02:12.817]  I thought I paid taxes to pay for this place.
[01:02:13.456 --> 01:02:13.756]  I think so.
[01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:47.132]  Over the years, this rabbit hole has got deeper, the pictures got bigger, and there's something, Alex, to do with the way they are manipulating the consciousness of people who are, if you like, operating at a certain level of frequency.
[01:02:48.072 --> 01:02:54.335]  You know, the brain is an electromagnetic, electrical operation.
[01:02:54.375 --> 01:02:56.736]  It's like a computer, like the whole body's like a computer.
[01:02:56.756 --> 01:02:57.356]  It's electrochemical?
[01:02:57.836 --> 01:03:00.717]  Yeah, electrochemical and electromagnetic.
[01:03:00.837 --> 01:03:03.158]  It's all to do with that stuff.
[01:03:03.198 --> 01:03:14.563]  And if you can access the body computer, as I call it, at the frequency levels it operates at, with the means, the electromagnetic, electrical, chemical means that it operates in,
[01:03:15.143 --> 01:03:24.490]  Then you can start changing the way that people operating at that frequency that you're manipulating at, think, feel and everything.
[01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:34.016]  Now this is an interesting point, a really interesting point that you've raised here, because I've been walking around and seeing this for many, many months now.
[01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:41.962]  There has been a consciousness change, Alex, very demonstrably among council officials
[01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:53.039]  People in uniform, no doubt about it, they've become more officious, they've become more robotic in the sense that they can't assess the situation on its merits.
[01:03:53.359 --> 01:03:56.662]  It's the law, mate, so I've got to do this and all this stuff.
[01:03:58.002 --> 01:04:03.406]  You can tell me about America, but in this country, I've demonstrably seen it in the last year or so.
[01:04:03.426 --> 01:04:09.690]  This has got more and more blatant and obvious, where you literally, mate, talking to robots.
[01:04:10.365 --> 01:04:16.466]  Who cannot function in assessing a situation and reacting to it.
[01:04:16.526 --> 01:04:19.647]  They have to approach every situation the same.
[01:04:19.687 --> 01:04:20.427]  It's extraordinary.
[01:04:20.787 --> 01:04:27.729]  And it's like, I got an email a few days ago, which I posted on my website, which is a classic case.
[01:04:29.009 --> 01:04:38.091]  A parent who's just sat her little child, she's having an ice cream on the side of this little fountain, no danger whatsoever in a public place.
[01:04:39.135 --> 01:04:45.787]  We've now got safety police in this country who came over and said, well, you've got to take your child off that
[01:04:49.824 --> 01:05:01.910]  Well, they're getting you trained to be minded, to have secret police talking to you, to have them asking what you're doing, putting you in files, controlling you.
[01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:07.873]  They're getting normal people who wouldn't have connections to the system and the police, they're training you.
[01:05:07.893 --> 01:05:10.815]  I mean, they admit the public schools here are prisons
[01:05:11.195 --> 01:05:11.435]  Yeah.
[01:05:11.455 --> 01:05:11.555]  Yeah.
[01:05:41.636 --> 01:05:47.304]  Yeah, this is one major level of what's going on, Alex, in my view.
[01:05:47.845 --> 01:05:57.038]  You know when they put rats or mice in these laboratory mazes, and if they go down certain channels in the maze, they get an electrical shock.
[01:05:57.825 --> 01:05:58.365]  I don't think so.
[01:06:14.873 --> 01:06:22.077]  Goodness me, it's expanding so fast that we're told what we can do, what we shouldn't do, we're threatened with prosecution, we'll be fined if you do this.
[01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:33.664]  Basically, what this is, it's a massive war on the human mind and the human consciousness and human emotion, basically to become subservient.
[01:06:33.804 --> 01:06:38.447]  It's a massive version of anything for a quiet life.
[01:06:39.728 --> 01:06:43.110]  And the more we acquiesce, the more they pile on.
[01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:58.498]  Yeah, because what they're building is a society in which they, for the vast, vast majority, they don't have to do anything to keep people in line, because they'll keep people in line like the rat or the mouse.
[01:06:58.578 --> 01:06:59.799]  It's the panopticon.
[01:06:59.879 --> 01:07:06.162]  It's the 200-year-old French system of making people think they're surveilled, and then they enforce on themselves.
[01:07:06.803 --> 01:07:08.804]  Yeah, and this brings me to another point.
[01:07:09.584 --> 01:07:20.792]  All this surveillance and the tracking and the databases and all this stuff, this is not for the vast majority of people on this planet.
[01:07:21.392 --> 01:07:33.861]  Because the vast majority of people will fall into that category whereby they will acquiesce through fear or through subservient programming that we've been talking about.
[01:07:34.461 --> 01:07:46.510]  All this stuff is for those that don't buy it, that don't fall for it, that hold their own mind and their own consciousness and their own reality, what might be called collectively the dissidents of the system.
[01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.871]  That's what that's for.
[01:07:48.211 --> 01:07:50.213]  To keep track and keep control of them.
[01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.155]  Because these guys are terrified of mavericks.
[01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:55.837]  They're terrified of people who aren't terrified of them.
[01:07:56.577 --> 01:07:59.300]  And so this is what it's really targeting.
[01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:06.529]  Because most people, as in Orwell's 1984, most of the people weren't a problem to Big Brother.
[01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:11.034]  It was the dissidents that Big Brother had the control systems in for.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:15.543]  Okay, we're going to go to break for the main network, but David, we're going to talk behind the scenes.
[01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:17.504]  Your phone's fine now, so we don't have to switch over.
[01:08:19.606 --> 01:08:20.226]  Stay right there.
[01:08:20.266 --> 01:08:26.711]  We're going to talk behind the scenes for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and the folks listening to the exclusive streams at InfoWars.com.
[01:08:26.731 --> 01:08:29.453]  Everybody else, we'll be right back in just three minutes.
[01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:35.057]  You want to hear this, go to the InfoWars.com exclusive streams or PrisonPlanet.com streams.
[01:08:35.137 --> 01:08:35.698]  We'll be right back.
[01:08:40.945 --> 01:08:41.805]  May I have everybody?
[01:08:42.046 --> 01:08:45.407]  Okay, David, I don't want to put you on the spot here with all the viewers watching.
[01:08:45.427 --> 01:08:52.151]  Do you absolutely have to go at the bottom of the next hour, or could you do another 10-minute segment, maybe to 40, 45 after with me?
[01:08:52.531 --> 01:08:53.732]  Okay, let's do that then.
[01:08:54.072 --> 01:08:54.852]  Let's do that.
[01:08:54.892 --> 01:08:55.612]  You're just awesome.
[01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:56.313]  You're just awesome.
[01:08:56.573 --> 01:08:57.393]  This is going so well.
[01:08:57.413 --> 01:09:00.135]  Listen, in the time we've got, I really
[01:09:00.735 --> 01:09:02.637]  Because I've seen you only do a few of these talks.
[01:09:02.677 --> 01:09:04.839]  You're so good at covering and I do the same thing.
[01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:08.402]  I get stuck in one sector of it because your knowledge is so large.
[01:09:08.763 --> 01:09:09.944]  Can we go big picture?
[01:09:10.044 --> 01:09:16.170]  I know you're giving people individual personal experience and I know that's so important, but I want to get your big picture.
[01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:21.052]  Like ten years ago you said this is going to happen A to Z. It happened.
[01:09:21.352 --> 01:09:26.074]  I want to hear you do another A to Z. I know you want to back up each point you make and give examples.
[01:09:26.094 --> 01:09:27.695]  We can come back and do that if you want.
[01:09:28.075 --> 01:09:34.178]  It's just I want you to give me your vision, your understanding, your wide spectrum analysis, which I really respect.
[01:09:34.418 --> 01:09:39.960]  In hindsight, a prophet, I don't mean literally, but a prophet is proven if his prophecies come true.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.642]  What your forecast is if they win.
[01:09:44.182 --> 01:09:51.064]  Or if we don't resist them enough versus the forecast, if people get out of their box, get out of their comfort space and fight back?
[01:09:51.785 --> 01:09:52.225]  You're okay.
[01:09:52.305 --> 01:09:52.745]  No problem.
[01:09:53.385 --> 01:10:07.510]  Listen, we'll also plug on the main radio show as we just did, but right now again, this will be big on the web, tell me about what you think the one most important book or video is that you have that people watching and listening right now should get.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:24.750]  Well, it's either the latest book, The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy, which is a massive work of doc connecting, pulling together information from a vast range of subjects and basically an amalgamation of the best stuff that I've understood and learned over the last nearly 20 years.
[01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:35.176]  And the other one is the DVD from Brixton that's coming out, which is Seven Hours, which is another massive work of doc connecting, which people can watch rather than read if they prefer that.
[01:10:35.802 --> 01:10:45.770]  But you know my whole focus really has moved along with all the other stuff but has moved to the nature of reality and what it is.
[01:10:46.365 --> 01:10:48.787]  Because these people understand the nature of reality.
[01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:52.289]  That's one of the great mysteries or secrets that they've carried.
[01:11:16.325 --> 01:11:18.225]  Oh, right on to that.
[01:11:18.786 --> 01:11:23.447]  But, you know, it's the old saying, it's the old principle.
[01:11:24.107 --> 01:11:27.868]  If I have knowledge and you don't have knowledge, I have power over you.
[01:11:27.888 --> 01:11:28.928]  It's disgusting.
[01:11:28.948 --> 01:11:32.949]  So, knowledge to them is not to be shared and to be celebrated.
[01:11:33.349 --> 01:11:38.671]  It's to be hoarded so it can control those that you keep the knowledge from.
[01:11:38.691 --> 01:11:40.991]  And what's happening is... Okay, here we go, here we go.
[01:11:41.011 --> 01:11:42.071]  Let's talk about that right now.
[01:11:42.111 --> 01:11:43.732]  David, we're back on the main show.
[01:11:43.772 --> 01:11:43.972]  Here we go.
[01:11:48.064 --> 01:11:54.386]  Okay, David and I were just talking about how we want to share knowledge, we want to learn more, we want to celebrate knowledge.
[01:11:54.406 --> 01:11:56.107]  The elite hoard it, control it.
[01:11:56.407 --> 01:12:09.251]  The universities, the military industrial complex, 90 plus percent of university research, it's all compartmentalized and then sent up to the architects to control it, manipulate it.
[01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:11.713]  And David was just now talking about that.
[01:12:11.793 --> 01:12:22.024]  Then when we start the next hour, for 45 minutes, he's going to spend with us, he's going to get into the master plan, what they want to build, what their endgame is, and how we can stop them.
[01:12:22.064 --> 01:12:28.150]  David, finish up with what you were just talking about, how they hoard knowledge, how it's the ultimate selfishness.
[01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:40.200]  Yeah, knowledge is something that sets people free, because the more you know, the more potential you have to control your own life, to understand your own world, to understand your own reality.
[01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:45.186]  And so what they've done over the centuries is two things.
[01:12:45.806 --> 01:12:46.387]  Thank you.
[01:13:01.861 --> 01:13:04.083]  Well, we're at a molecular level that resonates with that table.
[01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:28.628]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:29.289 --> 01:13:31.609]  We're within its frequency range, but we're decoding it.
[01:13:31.649 --> 01:13:39.752]  We live... The more I understand about this, Alex... You know, our brain sits in the fourth dimension, which the scientific equations show.
[01:13:39.772 --> 01:13:43.213]  I mean, our thoughts are more than even four-dimensional.
[01:13:43.874 --> 01:13:48.919]  Yeah, we live in what I call the holographic internet.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:55.105]  I'm sitting in a room now, and this hotel has the wireless internet.
[01:13:55.545 --> 01:13:56.406]  I can't see it.
[01:13:56.727 --> 01:14:04.174]  It's in the invisible realms beyond the frequency of visible light, which is the only frequency range that my eyes can access.
[01:14:04.714 --> 01:14:07.277]  However, if I put my computer on,
[01:14:07.817 --> 01:14:08.398]  I think so.
[01:14:27.156 --> 01:14:29.137]  The internet exists in that form.
[01:14:29.177 --> 01:14:30.197]  It's on the computer screen.
[01:14:30.297 --> 01:14:34.079]  Everywhere else, it's electronic circuits and on-off electrical pulses.
[01:14:34.519 --> 01:14:36.239]  People say, tell me about television.
[01:14:36.319 --> 01:14:38.280]  Oh, it's programs and moving pictures on a screen.
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.040]  Hold on a second.
[01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:42.322]  The only place television exists in that form is on the screen.
[01:14:42.402 --> 01:14:45.343]  Everywhere else, it's frequency fields and electronic circuits.
[01:14:45.363 --> 01:14:56.347]  And then it interfaces with your eyes, which are brain stalks, which then decode it in their own system, and that are then interpreted by the deeper centers of the mind.
[01:14:56.926 --> 01:15:15.605]  Yeah, we are like receiver transmitters, well never mind we're like, we are at the level of the body receiver transmitters of information from a quote matrix which operates just like the wireless internet and we are decoding it through the mind, through the various
[01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:20.842]  And the top admin let us in on this when they say, perception is reality.
[01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:45.811]  It is.
[01:15:46.291 --> 01:16:07.211]  And if I had to bring this down to the most foundation form, this whole conspiracy that plays out as banking scams and political scams and all the things that you deal with and I deal with, but at its foundation, it is the manipulation of our reality and our sense of reality.
[01:16:07.532 --> 01:16:08.693]  And it's more than this.
[01:16:10.052 --> 01:16:14.654]  In China, you can only access parts of the Internet.
[01:16:14.674 --> 01:16:15.654]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:16:15.694 --> 01:16:16.495]  David, got a break.
[01:16:16.535 --> 01:16:19.176]  Back in 70 seconds with the fourth hour.

[01:17:52.674 --> 01:17:55.295]  David Icke is our guest for another 45 minutes.
[01:17:55.775 --> 01:18:05.098]  At the bottom of the hour, I will take about five, six phone calls for David, specifically for David, on any question you have.
[01:18:05.118 --> 01:18:05.578]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:06.238 --> 01:18:08.299]  It is July 3rd, 2008.
[01:18:08.959 --> 01:18:12.480]  Jason Bermans will be sitting in for me live tomorrow.
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:20.503]  Coming out this evening, we're going to release on the web, a few hours early, at prisonplanet.tv, my new film, Truth Rising.
[01:18:21.503 --> 01:18:35.234]  And we're very, very excited as it energizes the population to go out there and take on the New World Order and get other people outside their comfort zones, outside the sheep zone, to tell the system we're not going along with it peacefully.
[01:18:36.095 --> 01:18:46.183]  David Icke, again, our amazing guest, you were talking about how they limit the perception of reality, how they keep us here just looking at, you know, the materialistic plane when humans are obviously so much more
[01:18:47.203 --> 01:18:50.584]  And you were talking about China, which limits large areas of the internet.
[01:18:50.904 --> 01:18:53.705]  Now we're seeing that in Europe, England, and the US.
[01:18:54.265 --> 01:18:57.986]  Companies, corporations, universities, internet too, they're now doing that.
[01:18:58.026 --> 01:18:59.086]  You've gotten up to that point.
[01:18:59.886 --> 01:19:09.709]  Yeah, the reason I raised the point about the Chinese internet is because it's so relevant to the way our reality is manipulated.
[01:19:10.462 --> 01:19:24.416]  In China, you can only get so much of the internet because it's firewalled off and those computers in that country cannot access, cannot decode the internet in those areas firewalled off.
[01:19:24.956 --> 01:19:29.321]  Now, what they've been doing and what they're really ratcheting up now
[01:19:29.961 --> 01:19:44.694]  is to firewall off our body computer's ability to access a much greater range of reality, even within this holographic internet, this matrix, whatever you want to call it.
[01:19:45.434 --> 01:19:55.323]  They are firewalling us off from great chunks of it, and being able to access knowledge, understanding, and what have you from it.
[01:19:55.988 --> 01:20:01.033]  And what they're doing are destabilizing the body computer.
[01:20:01.073 --> 01:20:03.895]  Now the body computer works electrically and it works chemically.
[01:20:04.336 --> 01:20:15.286]  When it is in chemical and electrical balance, we are at our sharpest and we are fully potential transmitter receivers of information.
[01:20:16.016 --> 01:20:22.418]  But you add sodium fluoride, mercury in the shots, booze, drugs, all of it, it clouds it.
[01:20:22.738 --> 01:20:29.000]  And then you add the electronic frequency pollution, you add the TV, you add all these flickering distractions.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:34.122]  I mean, they admit, first time you watch TV, 45 minutes and you're mesmerized, dream level.
[01:20:34.922 --> 01:20:37.763]  And then the next time it's 10 minutes, next time it's 30 seconds.
[01:20:38.103 --> 01:20:39.924]  People are literally mesmerized.
[01:20:40.104 --> 01:20:40.464]  Go ahead.
[01:20:41.164 --> 01:20:41.624]  Exactly.
[01:20:41.865 --> 01:20:50.691]  What they're doing is destabilizing the body computer so it becomes an inefficient transmitter-receiver of information.
[01:20:50.811 --> 01:20:58.756]  And so the band, the range of the reality that we are accessing gets smaller and smaller.
[01:20:58.816 --> 01:20:59.777]  It's interesting, you know.
[01:21:00.037 --> 01:21:02.059]  What do we say about people with closed minds?
[01:21:02.119 --> 01:21:03.660]  We say they're narrow-minded.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:08.363]  I would say they're narrow-banded because they're accessing just a minute...
[01:21:10.905 --> 01:21:13.786]  And when you shut down, you tend to get smaller and smaller.
[01:21:14.446 --> 01:21:16.927]  When you open up, your bandwidth tends to get bigger and bigger.
[01:21:16.947 --> 01:21:17.627]  Here are the studies.
[01:21:17.887 --> 01:21:21.129]  They'll have an 85-year-old, 97-year-old in one case.
[01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:23.510]  I've seen the autopsy reports in studies.
[01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:24.930]  My dad years ago showed these to me.
[01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:29.092]  Some composer who was speaking five languages, totally happy until the day they died.
[01:21:29.472 --> 01:21:32.534]  They cut open their brain cap, tiny brain, but they were a genius.
[01:21:32.934 --> 01:21:35.815]  Then they'll cut open some 70-year-old who died of Alzheimer's.
[01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:42.458]  Big brain, hadn't had a lot of tissue loss, but they were basically retarded when they died, and they're always TV heads.
[01:21:42.738 --> 01:21:49.201]  And they have all the studies that show TV is causing Alzheimer's, along with a cocktail of other things, because they weren't stimulating the mind.
[01:21:49.241 --> 01:21:52.123]  It was only one-way information.
[01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:59.535]  Yeah, I mean, you know, as the saying goes, Alex, size is not everything, and it's certainly not that with the brain.
[01:21:59.575 --> 01:22:11.344]  It's how efficient it is, how sharp it is, how its electrical and chemical systems are working, and the more you stimulate it, the more you stimulate and hone and sharpen those systems.
[01:22:11.764 --> 01:22:19.629]  So when you have the dumbing down, not just of America, but of country after country now, it's like a muscle.
[01:22:19.689 --> 01:22:37.941]  If you don't use it, then it starts to go to sleep, it starts to get flabby, it stops working properly, and you go into a smaller and smaller range of reality, which means that you cannot make the connections, you cannot connect the dots, you cannot see what is... Hold on one moment, we've got a break!
[01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:42.725]  Okay, we're going to talk behind the scenes now for a part of the audience.
[01:22:42.765 --> 01:22:43.526]  Come back in three minutes.
[01:22:43.546 --> 01:22:44.787]  I don't want to waste any time with you.
[01:22:45.748 --> 01:22:47.730]  Let's continue along that discussion line.
[01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:50.694]  Now, I'm not being elitist.
[01:22:50.734 --> 01:22:52.616]  I don't ever think of myself as sardonic.
[01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.578]  I'm an average farm boy from Texas.
[01:22:55.299 --> 01:22:56.160]  You've studied history.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.440]  I have gotten smarter.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:58.441]  I have learned more.
[01:22:58.981 --> 01:23:00.222]  My mind has opened up.
[01:23:00.302 --> 01:23:01.123]  I can write better.
[01:23:01.203 --> 01:23:02.023]  I can spell better.
[01:23:02.324 --> 01:23:06.647]  Supposedly after you're 30, you start losing brain tissue and that's not the case, but I am getting smarter.
[01:23:06.987 --> 01:23:09.048]  Now I found the studies that show that's actually the case.
[01:23:09.328 --> 01:23:16.913]  So everything you're saying is proven by the real science, but now, and it's not a view, it's not some sardonic view.
[01:23:17.354 --> 01:23:18.695]  I'm not lying to myself.
[01:23:18.735 --> 01:23:25.239]  I'm really noticing that either people are getting smarter, more dynamic, more open, more intelligent around me.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:27.181]  There's a quickening.
[01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:39.791]  They're either getting smarter, and more open, and more attuned, and more dynamic, and more effervescent, and magical, or, and the vast majority are getting worse, they're literally like zombies everywhere.
[01:23:40.191 --> 01:23:50.960]  Even people that work at companies, or are driving nice cars, it's like they can't talk anymore, they don't interact, it's like an acceleration of a zombification.
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:51.961]  Can you comment?
[01:23:52.521 --> 01:23:53.982]  This is a very important point.
[01:23:54.843 --> 01:24:00.288]  At the end of my talk in Brixton, I had a picture of a fork in the road.
[01:24:01.188 --> 01:24:04.111]  And we're at that point now, and it's becoming more blatant.
[01:24:04.171 --> 01:24:16.902]  It's like I said earlier, it's becoming so obvious that these people, the educated idiots, as you call them, and my father used to call them that, funnily enough, and the useful idiots in the system,
[01:24:17.422 --> 01:24:30.352]  They are becoming more and more closed down, more and more robotic, and yet the people who are awakening absolutely all over the world are changing in ways that you accurately describe.
[01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.334]  And I would put it this way.
[01:24:33.495 --> 01:24:37.138]  If you are a radio,
[01:24:38.027 --> 01:24:52.997]  And you have two radio stations, or one, that you can access, against a radio next to it that can access a great stream and band of stations, therefore information, knowledge, understanding, awareness.
[01:24:53.457 --> 01:25:08.383]  Which one is going to be the man in uniform or the close-minded pen pusher in the council or the government, and which one is going to be the free-thinking, whoa, flowing, open-minded, hey, I can see it, look, intuitive.
[01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:10.744]  It's obvious, and that's what's happening.
[01:25:11.204 --> 01:25:14.026]  People are opening their minds, Alex, and that's what it is.
[01:25:14.046 --> 01:25:19.009]  They're opening their minds to a greater range of reality.
[01:25:19.029 --> 01:25:19.750]  Bigger horizon.
[01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:23.192]  They are accessing that and expressing it.
[01:25:23.312 --> 01:25:25.554]  These great changes that people are going through.
[01:25:25.974 --> 01:25:33.279]  The others are getting in a narrower and narrower band, and they're becoming narrower and narrower and narrower.
[01:25:33.299 --> 01:25:35.100]  And it's a feedback loop.
[01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:40.203]  Those of us that are awakening are feeding on each other, and the dumbed down, the closed down, they're feeding off each other.
[01:25:40.264 --> 01:25:40.604]  Here we go.
[01:25:43.413 --> 01:25:47.396]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:25:50.279 --> 01:25:57.045]  Wow, David Icke is talking about how, in the behind-the-scenes of Prison Planet on TV viewers, he is talking about how
[01:25:59.079 --> 01:26:10.154]  The people that are going along with the system, the government people, the police, those that are in those closed down cult-like cultures, with all the peer pressure, they are closing down right now.
[01:26:10.514 --> 01:26:13.378]  You can see the myopic, almost grueling,
[01:26:14.299 --> 01:26:22.903]  I mean, you talk to people now, and either they're getting more closed down, I mean literally like retarded, or they're opening up and energizing and more intuitive.
[01:26:23.424 --> 01:26:25.785]  And I just, I dream of giving them knowledge.
[01:26:25.865 --> 01:26:27.526]  I dream of seeing them energized.
[01:26:27.886 --> 01:26:32.068]  I dream of seeing them seeing what I see, knowing what I know, and even more.
[01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:33.329]  And I just want to...
[01:26:34.927 --> 01:26:39.689]  Untie that, unloose it, and then I see the New World Order, which I can see more and more clearly now.
[01:26:39.749 --> 01:26:44.491]  I can see their designs, their master plans, not just from their own documents, but I can see the manifestation.
[01:26:44.852 --> 01:26:48.413]  I can predict what they're going to do down to the exact words, blowing people away.
[01:26:48.433 --> 01:26:51.615]  And as the real world is clearer and clearer to me,
[01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:57.398]  It's a little frightening as I see David Icke's world's pretty clear, actually.
[01:26:57.418 --> 01:27:02.682]  Then it horrifies me to see these stunted creatures.
[01:27:02.742 --> 01:27:03.803]  It's almost like in colors.
[01:27:03.823 --> 01:27:09.086]  There's these rainbow, happy, glowing light, you know, people waking up, shining brighter.
[01:27:09.106 --> 01:27:16.251]  And then there's these dark, like, black holes of people who are getting more and more evil, more and more hateful, more and more greedy and petty.
[01:27:16.651 --> 01:27:21.735]  And I see a huge war right now, that war against the people unlocking their minds.
[01:27:21.795 --> 01:27:22.195]  David Icke.
[01:27:23.175 --> 01:27:35.119]  Yeah, you know, when I go back to the days nearly 20 years ago when I was just minding my own business, introducing television programs, and suddenly the top of my head blew off.
[01:27:35.199 --> 01:27:43.501]  And for about three months, which is very much remembered by people in this country, for about three months if you'd asked my name I wouldn't have been able to tell you.
[01:27:43.521 --> 01:27:45.822]  If you'd asked me what planet I was on, I'd have had to check.
[01:27:46.402 --> 01:27:50.504]  But what happened in that period, it was like
[01:27:53.088 --> 01:28:09.672]  My mind opened so fast, for whatever reason, that all this knowledge that my mind and my brain did not have to decode before, suddenly it was decoding this massive amount of information that was coming into my mind.
[01:28:11.033 --> 01:28:20.195]  What happened to me for about three months was like when you press too many keys on the computer too quick, it freezes up and it goes, can't process this, shutting down, go away.
[01:28:20.965 --> 01:28:29.650]  And then after about three months, after mass ridicule because of what had gone on, my mind like morphed.
[01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:36.774]  It was like the computer unfroze and suddenly I could see the same world in a completely different way.
[01:28:36.834 --> 01:28:40.136]  Now David, let me ask you a question because I don't know a lot of people that have had this similar experience.
[01:28:40.696 --> 01:28:44.278]  I have that, but every six months, every year, it might be two times in a week.
[01:28:44.858 --> 01:29:05.984]  Like levels and then the problem is the level I'm on I can't even articulate to people so it's very frustrating that I can't even because it's like I'm at the Grand Canyon and you know on business and I and I call my wife and she says what's it look like describe it there's no describing it it's too big there's too much.
[01:29:06.004 --> 01:29:08.625]  Do you know I tell you what mate
[01:29:09.756 --> 01:29:38.469]  The biggest frustration of my life in the last 20 years has been being in that situation since that awakening, and people perceiving you as mad, as ridiculous, as far out, as dangerous, all these things, and you knew that you just couldn't explain where you were coming from fully, because you couldn't find the words to do it, because what you were knowing and what you were feeling
[01:29:38.949 --> 01:29:45.810]  We have simply, because we've been closed out for so long, we've not developed even the human language to express it.
[01:29:46.090 --> 01:30:04.854]  And what's a real joy to me now, I mean I could start crying to be honest as you bring this subject up, what's a real joy to me is that more and more minds are opening so we can now have a dialogue and people can understand other people and where they're coming from and where they've been.
[01:30:05.835 --> 01:30:10.597]  And so there is this massive parting of the ways, if you like.
[01:30:10.637 --> 01:30:12.278]  And that's got the New World Order upset.
[01:30:12.318 --> 01:30:14.239]  I mean, I'm not seeing arrogance anymore.
[01:30:14.599 --> 01:30:18.861]  They are acting like they are scared to death, like kryptonite or something.
[01:30:19.594 --> 01:30:33.741]  Well, it's interesting, Alex, you know, I've been saying for years now that this panic, and that's what it is, this mad panic to bring in this Orwellian state, is not even to advance their power.
[01:30:33.781 --> 01:30:34.741]  Yeah, they're desperate!
[01:30:35.181 --> 01:30:43.085]  Hold on to the power they'd already accumulated, because I was going to say, in those early years when my mind whacked open,
[01:30:43.869 --> 01:30:47.452]  I knew that there was a vibrational change coming.
[01:30:47.472 --> 01:30:52.636]  That's why I called the first book I ever wrote on these subjects back in 1990, Truth Vibrations.
[01:30:53.363 --> 01:30:57.466]  There was a vibrational change coming that was going to open people up.
[01:30:57.546 --> 01:31:02.090]  It was going to act like a spiritual alarm clock for those who were open to it.
[01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:14.260]  And that this network of control, which is a fear network, they're terrified of each other, and you're quite right, they are terrified.
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.000]  Of course!
[01:31:34.859 --> 01:31:41.683]  They live that, you know, John Carpenter movie was so accurate in so many ways about the way this system works.
[01:31:41.703 --> 01:31:42.684]  And that's their big joke.
[01:31:42.724 --> 01:31:44.085]  The general public isn't living.
[01:31:44.365 --> 01:31:45.006]  We're awake.
[01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:45.586]  We're living.
[01:31:45.606 --> 01:31:46.847]  We're just on the good guy's side.
[01:31:47.087 --> 01:31:47.667]  They're awake.
[01:31:47.707 --> 01:31:48.608]  They're on the dark side.
[01:31:49.249 --> 01:32:01.496]  Yeah, what they're terrified of, and this is why I said earlier, all this surveillance and stuff, and all this data, and all this tracking stuff, it's not for the mass of the population.
[01:32:02.537 --> 01:32:10.522]  It's for those who are awakened, because they knew, and I knew nearly 20 years ago, but who could I discuss this with?
[01:32:11.062 --> 01:32:21.028]  I knew 20 years ago that this stuff was coming in because they knew that the awakening was coming and they had to try to keep the trap door on it.
[01:32:21.348 --> 01:32:34.755]  And this is why it's in this period we've had the massive influx of chemicals in food, electromagnetic pollution, which is designed to manipulate the energy field that we live in, the food fields we live in.
[01:32:34.795 --> 01:32:36.316]  Yeah, all that stuff.
[01:32:36.736 --> 01:32:41.738]  It's designed to target those who have the potential to awaken.
[01:32:42.318 --> 01:32:43.339]  They're in terror!
[01:32:43.359 --> 01:32:44.960]  Let me stop you, let me stop you.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:55.684]  They report that the magnetic field of the earth, energized by the sun and space radiation, and this is mainstream science, is what plants and plankton and bacteria and the whole time clock's on.
[01:32:56.104 --> 01:32:58.225]  Not just the light, but the magnetic field.
[01:32:58.505 --> 01:33:02.247]  And then I had the head of Harp on last week, and he was admitting they create artificial
[01:33:03.067 --> 01:33:08.629]  Uh, Aurora Borealis, but then he said cell phones and, and, and, and wavelengths and radio waves.
[01:33:09.349 --> 01:33:10.509]  None of them are bad for us.
[01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:16.611]  When Mainline Science admits it'll fry you, I mean, it's just... The man's either an idiot or a liar, huh?
[01:33:16.771 --> 01:33:17.391]  None of them.
[01:33:17.411 --> 01:33:19.012]  He's the top scientist ahead of them.
[01:33:19.412 --> 01:33:21.854]  Jeez, but I mean, it's a nonsense.
[01:33:22.414 --> 01:33:27.658]  You know, I said to someone a few weeks ago, how do you affect all the fish at the same time?
[01:33:27.838 --> 01:33:29.159]  Answer, you affect the sea.
[01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:31.801]  You change the sea, you affect every fish.
[01:33:32.241 --> 01:33:37.345]  You change the sea of energy that we live in, which is what harp and all these other things are about, you affect everybody.
[01:33:37.425 --> 01:33:43.329]  Well, I've got hundreds of studies, and obviously you know this, but I'm backing up, David, that just sell towers and things.
[01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:46.672]  They always argue, well, the sun puts off a lot of this.
[01:33:46.692 --> 01:33:50.997]  Well, we're designed and created to live with its waves.
[01:33:51.057 --> 01:33:54.841]  You add all these other ones, that's what causes that butterfly effect.
[01:33:55.381 --> 01:33:57.784]  Yeah, but this is the key point.
[01:33:58.565 --> 01:34:04.010]  And I think, you know, it brings into some perspective what we've been talking about with this parting of the waves.
[01:34:06.909 --> 01:34:08.970]  Everything is about frequency.
[01:34:11.012 --> 01:34:16.235]  Quite obviously the cell phones work on a frequency.
[01:34:16.355 --> 01:34:18.957]  All these things that are being poured at us work on a frequency.
[01:34:19.137 --> 01:34:25.821]  Even a chemical additive in a soft drink or whatever is a frequency on an energetic level.
[01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:45.647]  Once you open your mind, open your heart, which is connected to the mind, energetically, and you raise to a higher frequency, then just like Radio A doesn't affect Radio B, because it's on the different frequencies, so these things stop affecting us.
[01:34:46.267 --> 01:34:48.848]  The ones, and this I think is very significant,
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.961]  to what we've been talking about.
[01:34:51.541 --> 01:35:12.228]  The ones who are not opening up, who are on that frequency which they're targeting, they're going to respond more and more in line with that frequency range manipulation, and so they're going to be more closed, more robotic, whereas other people who are not being affected by that manipulation, because they're out of the
[01:35:12.728 --> 01:35:12.908]  It's
[01:35:28.075 --> 01:35:30.556]  It's a mental and spiritual rebellion against tyranny.
[01:35:31.036 --> 01:35:33.758]  Did you see the Baltimore Sun article six years ago?
[01:35:34.098 --> 01:35:43.642]  Where DARPA that invented the net and everything else said, we are in the field testing waves and towers to make people relax during emergencies.
[01:35:43.982 --> 01:35:50.485]  And they said, and we have the patents from the fifties, but I mean, they were testing us when they just put that in the newspaper.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:36:16.591]  Well, I think you have something similar in America, but in Britain, the Blair government, even though we had a perfectly adequate and workable communication system for the emergency services in this country, suddenly at massive cost, changed it to something called the Tetra system, which they have these towers now all over Britain, and there's more and more all the time.
[01:36:16.631 --> 01:36:17.612]  Same thing here.
[01:36:17.792 --> 01:36:18.292]  Same thing here.
[01:36:18.792 --> 01:36:24.614]  Yeah, and they operate within human brainwaves, the range of human brainwaves.
[01:36:24.674 --> 01:36:28.395]  Now, you know, I say to people who say, well, it won't affect us.
[01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:29.376]  Well, hold on a second.
[01:36:29.696 --> 01:36:35.498]  When you go under those great power lines in your car with the radio on, what happens?
[01:36:35.538 --> 01:36:43.460]  Well, that's what they're doing to our electrical system and balance in the human body and the human brain.
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.961]  But again, the more we open up,
[01:36:46.878 --> 01:37:00.106]  The more we raise the frequency and expand the range that we're accessing, the more these things that are operating with a certain frequency range are not going to affect us like they're going to affect people who are still in that frequency range.
[01:37:00.286 --> 01:37:02.127]  But it's still not good for your tissue.
[01:37:02.387 --> 01:37:03.028]  No, it's not.
[01:37:03.368 --> 01:37:15.375]  It's not good to have, but I'm saying that if you're operating within these low emotional and mental states, then these things are going to affect you so much more powerfully.
[01:37:15.835 --> 01:37:20.697]  David, we're going to talk during this four-minute behind-the-scenes and come back for five minutes and then take calls.
[01:37:20.717 --> 01:37:20.857]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:37:20.897 --> 01:37:33.463]  But when we come back, I want you to talk about the stakes of what we face if we don't beat this, or whether you think it's foregone we're going to beat it, or foregone we're going to lose, or what their master plan is.
[01:37:33.483 --> 01:37:35.384]  I've got to get that out of you, David, before you leave us.
[01:37:35.404 --> 01:37:38.966]  But right now, we're going to talk more behind the scenes about mind control.
[01:37:40.969 --> 01:37:42.933]  Okay, John, let me talk to him.
[01:37:51.101 --> 01:37:54.662]  I think on a Discovery Channel show or something, and a lot of it's admitted, so I went to the library.
[01:37:55.003 --> 01:37:56.363]  I was in college then and looked it up.
[01:37:56.963 --> 01:37:59.944]  And not just subliminals in movies or TV, they admit all that.
[01:37:59.984 --> 01:38:03.986]  I took RTF, and that was in the textbooks, and you tell the public they don't believe it exists.
[01:38:05.026 --> 01:38:10.929]  But I remember reading that they have different standards for flicker rates, and that the U.S.
[01:38:10.989 --> 01:38:16.831]  adopted in the fifties a flicker rate that just so happened to be at the same rate of the brain.
[01:38:19.372 --> 01:38:23.893]  You know, that exact frames per second, that exact flicker rate, and that it is a fact.
[01:38:23.993 --> 01:38:25.934]  They know it's hypnotizing you.
[01:38:25.954 --> 01:38:26.334]  Yeah.
[01:38:26.534 --> 01:38:31.456]  And I wanted to ask you, why did Europe have a different higher rate?
[01:38:31.776 --> 01:38:32.796]  Why did the U.S.
[01:38:32.876 --> 01:38:36.817]  and Canada adopt one that did resonate exactly?
[01:38:36.977 --> 01:38:41.419]  And why did Europe go with one that does mesmerize, but not as well?
[01:38:42.059 --> 01:38:45.220]  And then what do you think all the high-def TV and all of this is about?
[01:38:46.508 --> 01:38:54.571]  Well, you know, maybe they weren't as accurate in Europe as they were in America.
[01:38:54.631 --> 01:38:59.534]  I can't answer that question except that the principle of what you say absolutely fits.
[01:38:59.954 --> 01:39:04.556]  I'll tell you one thing that I've intuitively felt for such a long time.
[01:39:05.276 --> 01:39:14.880]  This obsession and race to switch over from analogue to digital TV, and it's 2012, everything's going to be digital in this country, in Britain.
[01:39:15.810 --> 01:39:28.435]  There is some, I can't absolutely articulate great detail, there is some massive significance in terms of the effect that we've been talking about with digital TV.
[01:39:28.475 --> 01:39:34.318]  Well I know this David, when I watch, I don't watch a lot of TV but I have a big screen TV here at the office and we have digital cable.
[01:39:34.938 --> 01:39:38.619]  When I do watch it, you know, they'll have like five screens in the back with video.
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:44.942]  In basic marketing they teach that that makes you go into subconscious mode because only the subconscious can watch the five, six screens
[01:39:45.442 --> 01:39:45.642]  Right.
[01:40:01.733 --> 01:40:06.958]  Now, with millions of people playing the same game at the same time, that you go into a below-sleep state.
[01:40:06.978 --> 01:40:10.261]  You're in a sleep realm when you're watching TV after a few minutes.
[01:40:10.541 --> 01:40:15.966]  But with the video games, you go into oxygen, narcosis, pre-death function.
[01:40:16.367 --> 01:40:18.829]  And that's why a lot of folks are dying playing video games.
[01:40:19.089 --> 01:40:20.230]  Kids are having seizures.
[01:40:20.450 --> 01:40:22.452]  They are putting us into a death state.
[01:40:22.492 --> 01:40:23.213]  Were you aware of that?
[01:40:24.266 --> 01:40:27.349]  Well, not in that detail, but it absolutely fits.
[01:40:27.369 --> 01:40:28.390]  I'll tell you where it fits this most accurately.
[01:40:28.410 --> 01:40:31.713]  I mean, I've been aware of what video games do in principle and stuff like that.
[01:40:46.067 --> 01:40:54.994]  The biggest target is the young people and the children because they're the adults of tomorrow and they have the potential to wake up.
[01:40:55.434 --> 01:40:58.736]  And so what they're doing is targeting to them on a massive scale.
[01:40:58.776 --> 01:41:05.601]  I feel for young people today and that the video games are specifically targeting them, although some adults use them as well.
[01:41:06.041 --> 01:41:07.943]  So, I mean, if you look at the most
[01:41:09.084 --> 01:41:13.329]  Uh, appalling food in terms of additives, food and drink.
[01:41:13.429 --> 01:41:15.391]  It's that which is targeted to children.
[01:41:15.411 --> 01:41:20.036]  When you go to the store, it says bottled water with extra fluoride for the children.
[01:41:20.456 --> 01:41:24.581]  Oh God, extra fluoride, which is like fluoride, like a Spartan.
[01:41:26.369 --> 01:41:36.302]  Monosodium glutamate, all these things are excitotoxins, excite brain cells and destroy them and stop the natural... Let's talk about how they're targeting children right now.
[01:41:36.322 --> 01:41:37.744]  We're going back live on the main transmission.
[01:41:37.764 --> 01:41:38.005]  Here we go.
[01:41:43.066 --> 01:41:48.548]  David Icke was just talking to me behind the scenes here from PrisonPlanet.tv about how they're targeting the children.
[01:41:48.788 --> 01:41:52.049]  You go into the store, it says fluoride water for kids, extra fluoride.
[01:41:52.449 --> 01:42:03.692]  And the studies admit it's many times worse for children, attacking their cerebral cortex development, their entire brain, 20% IQ reduction, 20 point IQ reduction on average, federal studies.
[01:42:04.312 --> 01:42:05.312]  I mean, the cold-bloodedness.
[01:42:05.332 --> 01:42:06.793]  They now have the children's textbooks.
[01:42:06.833 --> 01:42:11.755]  I've got a bunch of them that say fluoride is one of the main vitamins and minerals you need.
[01:42:11.775 --> 01:42:13.556]  And it says how great it is.
[01:42:14.716 --> 01:42:15.857]  The mercury in the shots.
[01:42:16.277 --> 01:42:24.680]  The video games that bring you into an oxygen-starved narcosis in unnatural brainwaves that are only associated with near-death experiences.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.861]  And David was explaining why they were doing that.
[01:42:26.901 --> 01:42:27.121]  David?
[01:42:28.686 --> 01:42:43.523]  Yes, they're targeting the children, because of course the children of today are going to be around on the law of averages for longer than anyone else, and so they want to create this long-term Orwellian prison.
[01:42:44.464 --> 01:42:53.131]  For the young, so that by the time they become the adults, they're fully fledged robots and controlled by the system.
[01:42:53.271 --> 01:43:00.457]  And so it's video games that we were talking about in the break, are targeting children overwhelmingly.
[01:43:01.518 --> 01:43:10.386]  The foods and the drinks and the soft drinks that are most appallingly filled with chemicals and toxins and all this stuff,
[01:43:10.806 --> 01:43:10.966]  I don't
[01:43:29.944 --> 01:43:45.012]  The body is an electrochemical entity, and if you destabilize it electrically or chemically, then you are going to manifest an imbalanced behavior of that body, an imbalanced reaction, an imbalanced sense of reality.
[01:43:45.032 --> 01:43:46.172]  This is what's happening.
[01:43:46.212 --> 01:43:47.313]  We're poisoning the kids.
[01:43:47.433 --> 01:43:48.974]  Well, David, it's not your opinion either.
[01:43:49.474 --> 01:43:54.098]  We have all the big eugenicists, 80 years ago, 100 years ago, it's in my film, Endgame.
[01:43:54.578 --> 01:43:55.659]  I mean, document it.
[01:43:55.779 --> 01:43:59.682]  They wrote books saying we're going to put mercury in shots to brain damage and put fluoride in.
[01:43:59.702 --> 01:44:02.884]  We're going to feed them poison food to dumb them down.
[01:44:02.964 --> 01:44:04.886]  We've isolated the chemicals that'll do this.
[01:44:05.586 --> 01:44:13.669]  And it's so cold-blooded, it's so big, the conspiracy is so large and so open that the average person can't come to grips with it, but now they can.
[01:44:13.809 --> 01:44:22.813]  If the New World Order was to have their way, what's the time frame, what are we going to see in the next year, next two years, next ten years, what is going to unfold and how do you see us fighting it?
[01:44:23.713 --> 01:44:26.874]  Well, we are now standing at this fork in the road.
[01:44:27.635 --> 01:44:33.357]  And I said it in a media conference for this by-election yesterday.
[01:44:34.017 --> 01:44:50.436]  That I'm being very, very optimistic in saying that if we go on as we are, not sleepwalking into this Orwellian state, but hurtling towards it in a comatose state, then we will live in a global fascist state within 15 years.
[01:44:50.476 --> 01:44:51.918]  And I'm probably being optimistic with the 15.
[01:44:53.419 --> 01:44:58.600]  However, at the same time this is happening, this awakening is going on.
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:07.442]  Now, I understand why people don't realize the scale of the awakening because, you know, if it's not in the mainstream media, to most people it doesn't exist.
[01:45:07.802 --> 01:45:15.664]  And for the mainstream media to actually see something that's outside of its tiny, tiny pea-sized bubble that it covers...
[01:45:16.844 --> 01:45:19.326]  It has to be ten foot high with neon lights.
[01:45:20.487 --> 01:45:32.155]  But I can tell you, mate, from traveling to, what, 45 countries now around the world from the early 1990s, I've seen it in every country.
[01:45:32.315 --> 01:45:32.375]  Yes.
[01:45:32.415 --> 01:45:33.996]  And it's exponential.
[01:45:34.797 --> 01:45:38.980]  And because it doesn't get in the mainstream, the scale of it is not understood.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:40.901]  It is enormous.
[01:45:40.921 --> 01:45:45.306]  But it's not just that the mainstream's dumb, they're artificially not reporting on our victories.
[01:45:46.667 --> 01:45:59.640]  Exactly, but the thing is that what we need now to do is to harness this awakening into a unified force which will cease
[01:46:00.552 --> 01:46:01.533]  That's right.
[01:46:01.633 --> 01:46:02.514]  That's right.
[01:46:22.036 --> 01:46:22.857]  A quick story.
[01:46:23.237 --> 01:46:26.959]  I had a friend years ago, he was a famous comedian in Britain called Larry Grayson.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:34.244]  And I went to his funeral and another comedian told this story that Larry Grayson had told to him about an experience he had.
[01:46:34.704 --> 01:46:40.047]  And Larry Grayson in the days of the music hall and stuff like that, the last vestiges of it, he was in this musical show.
[01:46:40.067 --> 01:46:45.311]  It was an all-male show and he played the woman in it, kind of what he did.
[01:46:45.911 --> 01:46:47.272]  And at the end of the show he said,
[01:46:48.806 --> 01:46:58.372]  He dressed up as Britannia and all the men came on dressed as sailors and got on top of each other's shoulders and formed a pyramid appropriately.
[01:46:58.392 --> 01:47:03.695]  And they were doing it to this song, Rule Britannia and all this rubbish.
[01:47:03.796 --> 01:47:05.336]  Stay there, I want to hear it on the other side.
[01:47:06.878 --> 01:47:08.480]  Yeah, we got to finish on the other side of this break.
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.622]  Final segment with David Icke.
[01:47:11.203 --> 01:47:12.624]  Straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:12.644 --> 01:47:15.307]  We're really appreciative of him coming on with us.
[01:47:15.327 --> 01:47:16.388]  DavidIcke.com.
[01:47:16.749 --> 01:47:17.510]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:21.414]  Truth Rising is going to be released in the next few hours at InfoWars.com.
[01:47:30.828 --> 01:47:31.669]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:47:32.089 --> 01:47:37.373]  Truth Rising is going to be released in the next few hours at InfoWars.com.
[01:48:07.105 --> 01:48:08.026]  We're on the march.
[01:48:08.507 --> 01:48:10.109]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:13.733]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:19.705 --> 01:48:21.827]  Once, America was led by real politicians.
[01:48:22.047 --> 01:48:26.930]  Now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state, and federal are owned and controlled by corporations.
[01:48:27.131 --> 01:48:29.592]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[01:48:29.813 --> 01:48:33.936]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused grain prices to soar to the highest levels in history.
[01:48:34.096 --> 01:48:36.998]  Shortages of rice, corn, and wheat now exist in most countries.
[01:48:37.158 --> 01:48:40.380]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:45.344]  Food riots and breadlines occur daily in 30 nations, and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[01:48:45.544 --> 01:48:49.486]  Survival Enterprises are master distributors of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[01:48:49.606 --> 01:48:54.449]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit, and more.
[01:48:54.549 --> 01:48:56.189]  We have tons of food in stock now.
[01:48:56.389 --> 01:48:57.870]  Call 1-800-753-1981.
[01:48:58.090 --> 01:49:01.492]  That's 1-800-753-1981.

[01:49:12.918 --> 01:49:13.338]  Call now.
[01:49:16.815 --> 01:49:18.857]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[01:49:18.977 --> 01:49:21.379]  I've come with a message of information.
[01:49:21.399 --> 01:49:23.621]  9-11 was an inside job.
[01:49:23.661 --> 01:49:25.242]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[01:49:25.262 --> 01:49:26.803]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[01:49:26.924 --> 01:49:29.766]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[01:49:29.826 --> 01:49:33.449]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[01:49:43.126 --> 01:49:47.958]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[01:49:49.517 --> 01:49:50.398]  Inside job?
[01:49:51.759 --> 01:49:52.840]  How dare you?
[01:49:54.201 --> 01:49:59.265]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[01:49:59.285 --> 01:50:01.808]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[01:50:01.908 --> 01:50:08.373]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[01:50:18.522 --> 01:50:18.942]  Warning!
[01:50:19.123 --> 01:50:25.868]  The EPA states indoor air pollution is the number one health problem today, causing 50% of all illnesses.

[01:50:53.530 --> 01:50:59.752]  Tim, John, Graham, Joe, John and others are going to take some of your phone calls and have a quick question for David Icke.
[01:51:00.092 --> 01:51:02.073]  He's with us for this segment and then that's it.
[01:51:02.113 --> 01:51:03.793]  He's agreed to come back on the next few months.
[01:51:03.813 --> 01:51:10.636]  He's running for Parliament in England to expose the shell operation that is going on over there and heard his evidence.
[01:51:10.656 --> 01:51:12.536]  There's definitely no doubt about that.

[01:51:15.663 --> 01:51:17.284]  Again, your phone call is just a moment.
[01:51:17.944 --> 01:51:21.365]  David, you were finishing up to your famous comedian friend of yours.
[01:51:21.385 --> 01:51:24.626]  They're doing this Hail Britannia with him in the shape of a pyramid.
[01:51:24.726 --> 01:51:25.126]  Go ahead.
[01:51:26.047 --> 01:51:38.551]  Yeah, and Rule Britannia was, you know, building to the end and they all formed a pyramid on the stage and Larry Grayson came out dressed as Britannia and was manhandled up to the top of the pyramid for the big finish.
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:48.903]  And he said that one night there was a guy in the bottom left-hand corner of the pyramid who'd started to get a cough.
[01:51:49.963 --> 01:51:56.605]  And this night his cough got worse, and it coughed so much that he could no longer stand in the pyramid.
[01:51:57.345 --> 01:52:03.487]  And down came the pyramid, and Larry Grayson, symbolic of this elite on the top of the pyramid, ended up in row two.
[01:52:04.808 --> 01:52:08.449]  And all that it had taken was not, you know, someone
[01:52:09.505 --> 01:52:21.911]  You know, fighting at the top against Britannia symbolically, but someone who got a cough and walked away at the bottom of the pyramid, because the bottom of the pyramid holds the top of the pyramid up there.
[01:52:22.312 --> 01:52:34.478]  And when we stop cooperating with our own enslavement, because there are billions of us who are being enslaved, there's a handful at the peak of the peak of the peak who are orchestrating the enslavement in full awareness.
[01:52:35.681 --> 01:52:36.404]  It's all over.
[01:52:36.605 --> 01:52:37.428]  And they know that.
[01:52:37.628 --> 01:52:38.411]  They're terrified.
[01:52:38.431 --> 01:52:39.314]  You know what that is?
[01:52:39.475 --> 01:52:41.281]  That's a true Yertle the Turtle story.
[01:52:42.085 --> 01:52:42.305]  Yeah.
[01:52:42.425 --> 01:52:48.130]  Do you remember that movie, The Bug's Life, the animated movie?
[01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:53.294]  And he says if just one of these ants starts standing up, they can push us aside.
[01:52:53.554 --> 01:52:53.914]  Yeah.
[01:52:54.495 --> 01:53:02.461]  Basically, if they ever find out that we depend on them and not the other way around, then our way of life is over.
[01:53:02.561 --> 01:53:06.444]  And that's precisely what we face here.
[01:53:06.845 --> 01:53:08.486]  We are the ones with the power
[01:53:09.527 --> 01:53:21.296]  And they are the ones who are terrified of us finding that out, and that's why there's been this massive, constant campaign of suppression of knowledge and awareness to keep us in a smaller box than they're in.
[01:53:21.737 --> 01:53:33.747]  We're getting out of it, more and more people are, and it's going to be a very, very interesting few years as the irresistible force which is meets the immovable object which isn't.
[01:53:35.359 --> 01:53:50.854]  David, what do you think about the French students in England stabbed hundreds of times apiece, ritualistically tortured, biological weapons type students, and we have all these other microbiologists and engineers being murdered all over the world.
[01:53:50.894 --> 01:53:52.256]  What do you think is going on behind that?
[01:53:52.756 --> 01:53:55.839]  Well, I've just seen that because I've been out with the election all day.
[01:53:55.859 --> 01:53:57.280]  I've just seen that on the news tonight.
[01:53:58.251 --> 01:53:58.872]  We're good.
[01:54:11.286 --> 01:54:22.396]  This network of control in place, what they want, essentially, is for the cell door to click shut before enough people have realized they're even in a cell.
[01:54:22.876 --> 01:54:25.238]  So they're upping the ante all over the place now.
[01:54:25.338 --> 01:54:30.423]  I mean, we are having in this country the most incredible number of young people.
[01:54:30.943 --> 01:54:37.009]  Interestingly, often they are either famous in terms of one was in a
[01:54:38.177 --> 01:54:38.877]  Thank you.
[01:54:52.788 --> 01:54:53.108]  I don't
[01:55:13.895 --> 01:55:14.075]  Yes.
[01:55:14.115 --> 01:55:14.595]  Thank you.
[01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:36.618]  I'm reading that these guys that got killed, butchered in a satanic style torture ritual were studying parasites jumping between dog and cat fetuses.
[01:55:37.359 --> 01:55:41.983]  Man, I tell you, a bunch of the biological weapons guys in the U.S.
[01:55:42.383 --> 01:55:43.985]  were murdered ritualistically.
[01:55:44.625 --> 01:55:46.747]  The first one, when it all started, was in Virginia.
[01:55:46.767 --> 01:55:49.169]  Remember, they tortured him and carved a pentagram on his back?
[01:55:50.070 --> 01:56:01.233]  Yeah, the biotech industry, with Monsanto of course prime among them, are satanic.
[01:56:01.573 --> 01:56:12.475]  They're one of the most dark of all the cartels, and they are far more powerful within this network than people realize.
[01:56:13.376 --> 01:56:14.676]  Well, Rumsfeld headed them.
[01:56:14.736 --> 01:56:18.577]  He heads every company that does particularly evil stuff.
[01:56:18.637 --> 01:56:19.097]  Why is that?
[01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:21.391]  Well, because he's evil.
[01:56:21.731 --> 01:56:23.452]  I mean, I don't use the word evil very much.
[01:56:23.492 --> 01:56:32.458]  I think it's overused, but if you take it as the opposite of live, spelled backwards, the opposite of life, then evil is very appropriate with him.
[01:56:32.958 --> 01:56:35.019]  I mean, he was the man that brought aspartame.
[01:56:35.039 --> 01:56:36.160]  Oh my God.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:39.102]  Brain suppressant and brain destroyer.
[01:56:39.142 --> 01:56:41.303]  And he gave the reactors in North Korea.
[01:56:41.363 --> 01:56:42.484]  Listen to this, listen to this.
[01:56:43.064 --> 01:56:47.248]  Mr. Bonomo was studying a parasite which can spread from cats to human fetuses.
[01:56:47.668 --> 01:56:49.109]  See, it's a kill-human weapon.
[01:56:50.631 --> 01:56:56.275]  Mr. Frez's research was into bacteria which create ethanol for use as fuel.
[01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:07.521]  We've had so many scientists at the cutting edge of their profession in these very areas you're talking about, who have been taken out over the years.
[01:57:07.742 --> 01:57:10.183]  I mean, there was even a book written about them at one point.
[01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:11.403]  So many were taken out.
[01:57:12.804 --> 01:57:14.785]  They would be eating their meal in London.
[01:57:15.165 --> 01:57:21.108]  They would get up from it, drive to Bristol, which is a decent drive, where they had no family connections.
[01:57:21.208 --> 01:57:23.409]  They'd jump off the big suspension bridge there.
[01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:29.556]  And of course, all the surveillance cameras can never catch anything because they always turn off.
[01:57:42.971 --> 01:57:47.856]  And of course the surveillance pictures didn't come out.
[01:57:47.896 --> 01:57:48.897]  Obviously it wasn't working.
[01:57:48.917 --> 01:57:49.638]  Listen to this.
[01:57:49.658 --> 01:57:53.802]  A Frenchman killed in London was stabbed 196 times.
[01:57:54.623 --> 01:57:57.266]  They had been tortured ritualistically.
[01:57:58.789 --> 01:58:05.714]  Well, you see, this is, again, something that I've been talking about for a long, long time, and it seems so extreme.
[01:58:06.054 --> 01:58:07.155]  I know you have too.
[01:58:07.215 --> 01:58:11.017]  It seems so extreme that it's beyond people's ability to grasp that it's possible.
[01:58:11.438 --> 01:58:17.362]  But what you're talking about here is something that goes on behind the scenes in secret as a matter of
[01:58:17.602 --> 01:58:18.222]  I think so.
[01:58:40.638 --> 01:58:41.178]  Amazing.
[01:58:41.218 --> 01:58:42.299]  DavidIke.com.
[01:58:42.319 --> 01:58:44.639]  We're going to take some calls now for David.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:49.581]  We've only got 10 minutes left, but David, just briefly, what is the time frame?
[01:58:49.601 --> 01:58:50.961]  Do you think they're going to hit Iran?
[01:58:51.081 --> 01:58:53.242]  If they do, how do you see that unfolding?
[01:58:54.902 --> 01:59:02.745]  Well, I'll tell you what I learned a long time ago, which is kind of going towards it.
[01:59:02.885 --> 01:59:06.106]  I was told that there was going to be a conflict with China.
[01:59:06.166 --> 01:59:07.186]  That's where it was leading.
[01:59:07.791 --> 01:59:19.376]  What they wanted was a third world war that would complete the process which the first world war started, League of Nations, the second world war took on, United Nations.
[01:59:19.396 --> 01:59:22.617]  Then they can ration and have drafts and crack down on you.
[01:59:23.097 --> 01:59:32.861]  They want to bring in the world government so they can say, hey, look, the only way to stop war, in fact they said about the European Union, let's have a European Union trade together and then we'll stop wars in Europe.
[01:59:33.465 --> 01:59:41.194]  The only way to stop war is to have a world government and a world army, and the end of national armies so there's no more war.
[01:59:41.715 --> 01:59:43.837]  And so they want a massive global conflict.
[01:59:45.814 --> 01:59:50.576]  I was told, must have been 15 years ago, that that was where it was going to head.
[01:59:50.696 --> 01:59:59.380]  And I think the Middle East is designed to be the powder keg that starts to draw them in, and Iran could well be it.
[01:59:59.420 --> 02:00:03.441]  You see, I may be different to most people.
[02:00:03.541 --> 02:00:06.443]  I have real problems with the guy who's leading Iran.
[02:00:07.303 --> 02:00:09.604]  For him to come to power, when he did,
[02:00:10.644 --> 02:00:11.984]  I don't
[02:00:27.029 --> 02:00:33.596]  But this guy came in and then started speaking the language that allowed them to say, hey, this man's dangerous.
[02:00:33.696 --> 02:00:35.497]  I've got great reservations about that.
[02:00:35.537 --> 02:00:38.200]  Well, we know Reagan made deals for the arms for hostages.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:39.261]  That was all staged.
[02:00:39.721 --> 02:00:41.203]  And so we know there's major connections.
[02:00:41.223 --> 02:00:42.524]  Let's take some calls for David Icke.
[02:00:42.624 --> 02:00:46.368]  Always intriguing author, documentary filmmaker, lecturer.
[02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.990]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:00:48.010 --> 02:00:48.610]  You're on the air.
[02:00:48.650 --> 02:00:49.151]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:00:49.926 --> 02:00:55.468]  Woody Harrelson once said in a movie, only two good things ever came out of England, America and the Beatles.
[02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:59.089]  I think it's time we update that list to the Watson Brothers and you, David.
[02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:00.950]  David, good to talk to you.
[02:01:01.450 --> 02:01:02.331]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:02.371 --> 02:01:03.311]  That's very kind.
[02:01:04.551 --> 02:01:08.413]  Alex, it was David that led me to you through some of his books.
[02:01:08.473 --> 02:01:09.813]  It was sort of like, you know, your Chemistry 101.
[02:01:10.354 --> 02:01:12.714]  David was the catalyst, and you were the monomer.
[02:01:12.754 --> 02:01:17.936]  And as you know, I've been gum on your shoe for like six years now, and I consider you both best friends that I've never met.
[02:01:18.136 --> 02:01:19.317]  David, I own four of your books.
[02:01:19.907 --> 02:01:31.372]  On the bottom of page 206 in The Biggest Secret, there's a picture in the Bohemian Grove of Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon with the inventor of plutonium, Glenn Seaborg.
[02:01:32.513 --> 02:01:40.636]  I'd love to see that picture put on one of your guys' sites and people just mass mail it to Michael Reagan and ask him to please explain.
[02:01:40.656 --> 02:01:42.877]  Actually, I think we have that photo on InfoWars.com.
[02:01:45.071 --> 02:01:51.754]  Well, I mean, that picture was so symbolic of the way that you've got two people.
[02:01:51.934 --> 02:01:54.915]  One was a B-movie actor jumping on an office horse at the time.
[02:01:54.955 --> 02:02:00.998]  The other one was a soon-to-be politician that was taking on Kennedy in the 1960 election.
[02:02:01.738 --> 02:02:09.842]  And both, despite those vastly different backgrounds, were both at Bohemian Grove and both go on to be presidents of the United States.
[02:02:09.862 --> 02:02:12.783]  And by the way, you forgot that Eisenhower's also in the photo.
[02:02:13.504 --> 02:02:22.927]  Yeah, well, I mean, you know, because Eisenhower rose so rapidly in the military, and you only do that, and then to president.
[02:02:22.967 --> 02:02:25.248]  You only do that if the right people are behind you.
[02:02:25.748 --> 02:02:28.709]  And now we have Barack Obama, of course, bringing in change.
[02:02:28.789 --> 02:02:31.209]  I mean, you know, I mean, do me a favor, you know.
[02:02:33.208 --> 02:02:34.028]  That was my question.
[02:02:34.068 --> 02:02:36.029]  Brzezinski for President, I say.
[02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:41.510]  Look, it doesn't matter, McCain, Obama, but Obama's got the really heavy hitters behind him.
[02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:42.811]  He's going to be bad news.
[02:02:42.851 --> 02:02:43.511]  Thank you, Tim.
[02:02:43.831 --> 02:02:47.052]  But he'll fool a lot of people for one more ride, one more scam.
[02:02:47.572 --> 02:02:52.413]  You're not going to hear Barack Obama say they're carrying out eugenics against blacks like nobody else.
[02:02:52.973 --> 02:02:59.335]  No, he'll be attacked by the white racists, and then, oh, he must be good for the blacks, and then he'll lead the blacks right into the Planned Parenthoods.
[02:03:00.115 --> 02:03:01.556]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:03:02.304 --> 02:03:12.047]  Yes, I agree with Mr. Ica that the ultimate target of the neo-cons is China and the stepping stones are Iraq and Iran.
[02:03:12.107 --> 02:03:12.987]  I totally agree with that.
[02:03:13.007 --> 02:03:15.247]  They even said so in the Project for a New American Century.
[02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:24.750]  But I think right now the box that the media is trying to keep us in is that there's some kind of a difference between Obama and McCain.
[02:03:24.850 --> 02:03:28.091]  And I think in a certain sense the greater danger is Obama
[02:03:28.672 --> 02:03:34.759]  Because so many people have been convinced through cult of personality that there's some kind of a difference.
[02:03:35.239 --> 02:03:48.674]  I think you made a good point there about how the neocons got their start in the Democratic Party through the Henry Jackson faction, the military-industrial faction of the Democratic Party, before they joined the Republicans.
[02:03:49.864 --> 02:04:01.570]  There's so many people right at this point now that somehow make excuses for Obama when he gets on his knees, goes to his knees... I hear you John, we gotta jump so we can get the other callers.
[02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:14.196]  Yes, bottom line, this is the false left paradigm, it's time for people to grow up, and until you realize they own all the major parties, and until you realize the power structure... People think the President is the end all be all.
[02:04:14.436 --> 02:04:15.417]  He isn't, is he David?
[02:04:16.627 --> 02:04:18.288]  No, I mean, the president's a puppet.
[02:04:18.328 --> 02:04:19.608]  I mean, I have this line.
[02:04:20.169 --> 02:04:24.110]  If you can see him, he's not at the top of the pyramid.
[02:04:24.150 --> 02:04:28.572]  I mean, the people who are really pulling the strings are in the shadows.
[02:04:28.672 --> 02:04:32.114]  Probably, you know, no one's ever heard of them, the real power.
[02:04:32.274 --> 02:04:33.134]  Graham and Seattle.
[02:04:33.154 --> 02:04:41.858]  These are just cardboard cutouts who are vehicles to introduce the legislation that changes society in line with the shadow people's agenda.
[02:04:42.418 --> 02:04:48.202]  And then we have a debate about whoever they put out in front of us instead of never looking above that to the real power structure.
[02:04:48.262 --> 02:04:49.123]  Graham in Seattle.
[02:04:50.444 --> 02:04:55.608]  Hi David, good to hear you on and I definitely agree with a lot of what you're saying.
[02:04:56.167 --> 02:05:04.470]  One of the major ways that I feel like people dismiss ideas about 9-11 being an inside job or, you know, various depopulation schemes and whatnot, I'm seeing it.
[02:05:04.810 --> 02:05:10.392]  Looking at a Times Online article about you, from June 27th, it says, Reptilians, beware!
[02:05:10.532 --> 02:05:11.512]  David Icke is back.
[02:05:11.572 --> 02:05:15.593]  And it says, according to Mr. Ike, I'm sorry, David Ike, I'm sorry for pronouncing your name wrong.
[02:05:15.913 --> 02:05:23.476]  According to Mr. Ike's belief, the world is ruled by a secret group of Illuminati, a race of shape-shifting reptilian humanoids known as the Babylonian Brotherhood.
[02:05:24.497 --> 02:05:29.341]  Well, first of all, I posted that on my website today.
[02:05:29.381 --> 02:05:33.705]  It's one of the reports about me standing in this election.
[02:05:34.226 --> 02:05:39.010]  Well, you know, some of the things that I've said over the years have been far out for most people.
[02:05:39.070 --> 02:05:40.912]  But, you know, just take this on board.
[02:05:41.596 --> 02:05:47.319]  Just look at what myself and Alex have been discussing in the last hour and a half or so.
[02:05:47.739 --> 02:05:54.623]  The scale of what we've been discussing, the multi-subjects, the multi-levels of what we're discussing.
[02:05:55.063 --> 02:06:02.206]  And then ask yourself, could a group of people in dark suits around a table orchestrate all that?
[02:06:02.646 --> 02:06:03.767]  Or is it bigger than that?
[02:06:03.887 --> 02:06:05.128]  I would say it's bigger than that.
[02:06:05.208 --> 02:06:07.629]  But if you disagree, that's your right.
[02:06:07.969 --> 02:06:09.190]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:16.258]  You know, I go up to that point, and then David goes off and does that, but I think we need to all be open-minded.
[02:06:16.278 --> 02:06:23.408]  The elites do believe they are worshipping and being directed by demon creatures.
[02:06:23.468 --> 02:06:24.769]  Now, whether that's real or not,
[02:06:27.352 --> 02:06:28.813]  I mean, they believe it.
[02:06:28.893 --> 02:06:33.456]  So that's why I think, you know, that certainly people can try to then say, well, we're all nuts.
[02:06:33.737 --> 02:06:35.038]  Hey, the Federal Reserve's private.
[02:06:35.278 --> 02:06:36.018]  They carried out 9-11.
[02:06:36.338 --> 02:06:37.219]  We can prove all that.
[02:06:37.779 --> 02:06:42.483]  And, you know, I mean, they've got things, five football fields long floating around above Dallas.
[02:06:42.763 --> 02:06:45.124]  And Larry King Live is saying aliens are about to land.
[02:06:45.344 --> 02:06:46.745]  The Pope says aliens are coming.
[02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:47.486]  They're our brothers.
[02:06:47.866 --> 02:06:49.527]  Something big is on the horizon.
[02:06:49.747 --> 02:06:51.008]  They're going to stage something.
[02:06:51.348 --> 02:06:54.871]  And so David Icke is at one-tenth as radical as Larry King Live is now.
[02:06:56.752 --> 02:07:00.734]  The thing I would say, Alex, is important, you know.
[02:07:01.134 --> 02:07:04.556]  I mean, people should just take what feels right to them.
[02:07:04.996 --> 02:07:13.560]  I mean, if they want to take the level of this conspiracy as it plays out in the five cents world, then take it at that level and let's react to that level.
[02:07:13.781 --> 02:07:19.603]  Let's join together at that level and ignore the things that you think are too far out.
[02:07:19.703 --> 02:07:22.365]  You know, you don't have to take it all, just take what feels right.
[02:07:24.045 --> 02:07:27.767]  Yeah, well, I know this, the elite really do think they're worshipping weird entities.
[02:07:28.147 --> 02:07:29.307]  They certainly do.
[02:07:29.327 --> 02:07:32.689]  They certainly are hardcore serious when they're cutting kids' heads off for it.
[02:07:33.869 --> 02:07:34.590]  Look, we're out of time.
[02:07:34.650 --> 02:07:43.393]  I don't want to cut a caller here short, Joe, John, Lynn, because we're basically out of time and I want to come back with some final comments in the final segment.
[02:07:43.433 --> 02:07:47.735]  David, I don't want to wait another two years or a year or whatever to have you back up.
[02:07:47.755 --> 02:07:49.156]  Can I have you up in the next few months again?
[02:07:49.396 --> 02:07:50.316]  Yeah, that would be great.
[02:07:52.527 --> 02:08:04.193]  If I could just finish on one thought, that we should not allow our sense of reality and our sense of possibility to be confused with what's actually possible.
[02:08:04.693 --> 02:08:06.394]  That's the big mistake we make.
[02:08:06.574 --> 02:08:07.974]  Because then you narrow your horizons.
[02:08:08.054 --> 02:08:17.859]  It's not saying people accept what you're saying, it's saying just allow yourself to look at everything and then that by itself will give you a wider view instead of shuddering what you're seeing.
[02:08:18.519 --> 02:08:21.141]  It's what Socrates is supposed to have said in ancient Greece.
[02:08:21.362 --> 02:08:23.764]  Wisdom is knowing how little we know.
[02:08:23.784 --> 02:08:25.405]  That keeps your mind open.
[02:08:25.485 --> 02:08:29.168]  Not to believe anything, but to be open to all possibility.
[02:08:29.328 --> 02:08:32.351]  Because the world's much bigger than the one we think we're living in.
[02:08:32.571 --> 02:08:34.933]  DavidIke.com, InfoWars.com is my site.
[02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:35.594]  David, thank you.
[02:08:36.074 --> 02:08:36.614]  Cheers, Alex.
[02:08:36.654 --> 02:08:38.196]  I'm going to say bye to you during the break.
[02:08:41.542 --> 02:08:42.363]  Hold on, I'm talking to David.
[02:08:42.603 --> 02:08:43.904]  Hey, then you narrow your horizons.
[02:08:43.964 --> 02:08:53.790]  It's not saying people accept what you're saying, it's saying just allow yourself to look at everything, and then that by itself will give you a wider view instead of shuttering what you're seeing.
[02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:59.654]  It's what Socrates is supposed to have said in ancient Greece, wisdom is knowing how little we know.
[02:08:59.994 --> 02:09:05.037]  That keeps your mind open, not to believe anything, but to be open to all possibility.
[02:09:05.257 --> 02:09:05.577]  Okay.
[02:09:05.978 --> 02:09:08.199]  The world's much bigger than the one we think we're living in.
[02:09:08.479 --> 02:09:10.860]  DavidIke.com, Infowars.com is my site.
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:11.520]  David, thank you.
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:12.460]  Cheers, Alex.
[02:09:12.480 --> 02:09:14.141]  I'm going to say bye to you during the break.
[02:09:16.602 --> 02:09:18.282]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:09:18.563 --> 02:09:22.024]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:09:22.184 --> 02:09:24.024]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:09:24.545 --> 02:09:27.366]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:09:27.686 --> 02:09:33.148]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:09:33.408 --> 02:09:37.309]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:09:37.649 --> 02:09:42.573]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:09:42.853 --> 02:09:45.615]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[02:09:45.895 --> 02:09:52.740]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:58.944]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[02:09:59.105 --> 02:10:03.608]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[02:10:03.908 --> 02:10:06.432]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[02:10:06.772 --> 02:10:08.435]  Join PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:10:08.835 --> 02:10:10.618]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[02:10:10.818 --> 02:10:12.621]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[02:10:12.961 --> 02:10:14.383]  Bring down the New World Order.
[02:10:14.724 --> 02:10:15.485]  PrisonPlanet.TV
[02:10:16.886 --> 02:10:25.614]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[02:10:25.794 --> 02:10:30.578]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[02:10:30.958 --> 02:10:41.988]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[02:10:42.469 --> 02:10:48.015]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:10:48.236 --> 02:10:54.323]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:10:54.523 --> 02:10:55.144]  What about you?
[02:10:55.544 --> 02:10:59.549]  Order your KDF shower filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[02:11:01.972 --> 02:11:04.055]  Call the Berkey Guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653.

[02:11:16.127 --> 02:11:16.688]  Hey, Bonnie.
[02:11:16.848 --> 02:11:18.269]  No more pickpocketing for us.
[02:11:18.549 --> 02:11:22.693]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[02:11:22.873 --> 02:11:23.975]  How so, Clyde?
[02:11:24.155 --> 02:11:26.917]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[02:11:27.098 --> 02:11:31.742]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse.
[02:11:31.942 --> 02:11:32.483]  Just watch.
[02:11:33.083 --> 02:11:33.604]  Hey, look!
[02:11:33.624 --> 02:11:35.025]  That's my info on the screen!
[02:11:35.185 --> 02:11:36.426]  You gotta be kidding me!
[02:11:36.667 --> 02:11:36.907]  Nope.
[02:11:37.047 --> 02:11:41.091]  With 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[02:11:46.829 --> 02:11:48.210]  Yeah, it was with David Icke.
[02:11:48.310 --> 02:11:49.130]  In China, too.
[02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:52.591]  Coming from the New World Order, babe.
[02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:55.872]  It's time to catch this train.
[02:11:55.892 --> 02:11:58.273]  Because if you don't, I'm sorry for you.
[02:11:58.313 --> 02:12:00.434]  People of the world, join hands.
[02:12:00.514 --> 02:12:01.414]  Join hands.
[02:12:15.998 --> 02:12:17.358]  It's a love train!
[02:12:18.919 --> 02:12:32.983]  Love train!
[02:12:33.003 --> 02:12:34.983]  Under hardcore bioweapon attack.
[02:12:35.023 --> 02:12:35.963]  We're coming to help you.
[02:12:36.183 --> 02:12:39.564]  All of you in the mental prison.
[02:12:45.811 --> 02:12:48.673]  The Info Warriors are coming to unlock your mind.
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:56.881]  Don't miss it.
[02:12:57.901 --> 02:12:59.102]  They live, we sleep.
[02:12:59.983 --> 02:13:01.364]  Time to wake up, folks.
[02:13:02.886 --> 02:13:05.408]  I'm awake and I only want you to have the same thing I have.
[02:13:06.008 --> 02:13:09.932]  Many of you will go to levels much higher than I am when it comes to understanding.
[02:13:11.853 --> 02:13:13.275]  Alright, this is the final segment.
[02:13:14.198 --> 02:13:15.719]  Don't have any time to take any more calls.
[02:13:16.439 --> 02:13:19.321]  Feels like Friday because I'm going to be off tomorrow, but Jason Burmiss is going to be sitting in.
[02:13:19.601 --> 02:13:20.502]  Here's the big announcement.
[02:13:21.202 --> 02:13:21.683]  You can watch...
[02:13:23.168 --> 02:13:24.028]  The film right now.
[02:13:24.969 --> 02:13:26.829]  You can go right now and watch.
[02:13:27.550 --> 02:13:29.831]  This is a military operation against the New World Order.
[02:13:29.851 --> 02:13:34.032]  We always spring things when we want early, generally, unannounced.
[02:13:35.353 --> 02:13:36.973]  You can see the film right now.
[02:13:37.073 --> 02:13:42.735]  It officially comes out on July 4th, but we're doing this about 8 hours, 9 hours early, depending on what time zone you're in.
[02:13:43.236 --> 02:13:46.717]  Hell, over in England, it's going to be midnight soon anyways.
[02:13:46.757 --> 02:13:49.138]  It certainly isn't Russia and China right now.
[02:13:49.938 --> 02:13:55.640]  So you can say that it is already July 4th there, and it's all going to be going live.
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:14:06.524]  I mean, it's up there right now, but the links are going live in the next 5-10 minutes at InfoWars.com, at PrisonPlanet.tv, at PrisonPlanet.com, for all PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:14:06.564 --> 02:14:09.685]  If you don't have a membership, it's 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.

[02:14:14.768 --> 02:14:16.410]  So you support us there.
[02:14:16.450 --> 02:14:17.971]  But there's going to be a DivX version.
[02:14:17.991 --> 02:14:20.353]  You can burn it to disc to give to people in high quality.
[02:14:20.713 --> 02:14:22.014]  Most players have DivX now.
[02:14:22.374 --> 02:14:24.176]  You can burn it to regular DVD if you want.
[02:14:24.216 --> 02:14:30.300]  If they don't have that type of player, you can buy the high quality DVD to get the best quality at InfoWars.com for $19.95.
[02:14:30.961 --> 02:14:34.063]  So go to InfoWars.com, order the DVD.

[02:14:41.570 --> 02:14:43.912]  That's PrisonPlanet.tv.
