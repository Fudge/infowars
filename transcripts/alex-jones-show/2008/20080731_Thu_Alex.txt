[00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:07.229]  Okay, let's go straight into our interview with Red Beckman.
[00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.816]  He is the father of the Fully Informed Jury Association Movement.
[00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:17.260]  He co-wrote the book, The Law That Never Was.
[00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:21.165]  Just such important information.
[00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:25.550]  So, Red, let's start out with
[00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:30.220]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, we have been exposed through the government school system
[00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:03.566]  Uh, to a very limited amount of the true history of, uh, how our nation was founded.
[00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:16.328]  And, um, and what I really want to get into, um, on this show is, uh, how that we were short changed, uh, in that education system.
[00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:23.310]  And, um, we were not taught about juries and how they are so critical.
[00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:28.484]  Uh, to making our system work and make it work properly.
[00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:39.228]  Now, I have opportunities at times to confront lawyers and I ask lawyers, I say, um, uh, what is the highest court in the land?
[00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:45.611]  And I can ask that question of 999 people out of a thousand in this country.
[00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:47.251]  And they'll all say the same thing.
[00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.292]  They'll all say the U S Supreme court.
[00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:51.313]  Well, that's not true.
[00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:53.534]  The U.S.
[00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:57.096]  Supreme Court is not the highest court in our land.
[00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:03.219]  The 7th Amendment common law jury is the highest court in our land.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.141]  I don't have any attorneys that argue with me after I explain this.
[00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:15.845]  This is part of the process of shortchanging for over 200 years.
[00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:24.393]  The legal profession has tried to drop the seventh article of the Bill of Rights through the cracks.
[00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:35.356]  Now, the Bill of Rights, we should have all learned all about the Bill of Rights right in our, well, starting in about the fifth or sixth grade.
[00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:39.216]  We should have been learning about the Bill of Rights and what it means.
[00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:42.637]  And we did learn a certain amount about the First Amendment.
[00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:46.398]  We learned about the freedom of speech and the freedom of press.
[00:02:47.136 --> 00:03:02.345]  The founders understood the importance of having a free press and having the right to speak out, and they understood that you can't let the government have free access to your papers and your houses and your things.
[00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:10.230]  So they put in the Fourth Amendment, which covered illegal searches and seizures, and they put in the Fifth Amendment.
[00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:19.010]  Which, uh, you know, made it so that, uh, you had to have a grand jury indictment before they could charge you with a major crime.
[00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:22.952]  Uh, they could not force you to be a witness against yourself.
[00:03:23.793 --> 00:03:29.716]  And, um, the first, fourth, and fifth amendments, of course, are the darlings of the ACLU and such.
[00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:35.300]  However, those three amendments, they are very, very important.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.103]  But the seventh amendment is even more important than those three because
[00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:47.193]  The First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, they have no enforcement power.
[00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:54.920]  If a bureaucrat or a politician violates your freedom of speech or your freedom of press, where is your remedy?
[00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:59.004]  The remedy is in the Seventh Amendment.
[00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.687]  Students go to law school.
[00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:04.889]  They spend three years in law school.
[00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:12.808]  They spend weeks and days and weeks and days on the First Amendment and they spend lots of time on the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment.
[00:04:13.868 --> 00:04:27.012]  And the only thing they learn about the Seventh Amendment is that you are secured, your right to a jury trial in a civil case is secured by the Seventh Amendment.
[00:04:27.992 --> 00:04:32.593]  There's so much more to that Seventh Amendment and they didn't want you to know.
[00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:40.083]  Now, did you get a copy of a letter that I emailed to your program director?
[00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:42.565]  Yes, it's here in a folder.
[00:04:44.306 --> 00:04:48.109]  Well, there's a sentence in there that is so important.
[00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:59.956]  It says this, it says, the Seventh Amendment common law jury is the highest court in the land because even the nine justices of the U.S.
[00:05:00.016 --> 00:05:02.578]  Supreme Court are government agents.
[00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:09.721]  That is more than just dynamite.
[00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:11.902]  That is nuclear.
[00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:21.148]  Well, what balances out government power versus the citizens who are the power is that we are the deciders on the grand juries and juries over the courts.
[00:05:21.168 --> 00:05:21.689]  Absolutely.
[00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:32.471]  Uh, the, uh, the second clause, uh, of the first, of the Seventh Amendment... Red, we gotta break again.
[00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:35.153]  We come back, long segment, and we just skipped over that.
[00:05:35.193 --> 00:05:37.655]  That's a key point you were just making.
[00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:39.997]  We need to flesh that out more for people.
[00:05:40.398 --> 00:05:41.739]  This is our enforcement power.
[00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:43.140]  This is how we control the government.
[00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:48.224]  The Seventh Amendment is one of the most important things in our system.
[00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:49.746]  We're on the march.
[00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:51.747]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:05:55.826 --> 00:06:04.853]  Absolutely, and the second clause of the 7th Amendment... We've got to break again.
[00:06:04.873 --> 00:06:06.634]  We've come back long segment.
[00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:07.595]  We just skipped over that.
[00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.097]  That's a key point you were just making.
[00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:12.439]  We need to flesh that out more for people.
[00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.180]  This is our enforcement power.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.581]  This is how we control the government.
[00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:20.685]  The 7th Amendment is one of the most important things in our system.
[00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:22.126]  We're on the march.
[00:06:22.607 --> 00:06:24.108]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:06:25.123 --> 00:06:27.986]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:32.490]  It is a big idea.
[00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.612]  A new world order.
[00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:39.556]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:06:40.217 --> 00:06:42.339]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.201]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:06:45.842 --> 00:06:48.244]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:06:48.994 --> 00:06:56.344]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:59.344 --> 00:07:04.327]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:07:04.808 --> 00:07:08.270]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.152]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:07:11.252 --> 00:07:12.373]  Most people have no idea.
[00:07:12.393 --> 00:07:13.173]  They're not after money.
[00:07:13.193 --> 00:07:14.254]  They have all the money they need.
[00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:15.175]  They're after power.
[00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:16.275]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[00:07:33.387 --> 00:07:35.448]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:38.710]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:45.435]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston.

[00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:33.698]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:39.040]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.023]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:08:44.383 --> 00:08:55.568]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:08:55.908 --> 00:08:58.910]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons.
[00:09:12.938 --> 00:09:16.361]  Some folks are born made to wait to fly.
[00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:17.602]  Ooh!
[00:09:18.322 --> 00:09:20.344]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:09:20.944 --> 00:09:22.586]  The red, white, and blue.
[00:09:23.426 --> 00:09:30.451]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[00:09:30.491 --> 00:09:31.692]  Tell them!
[00:09:33.476 --> 00:10:01.756]  God, it ain't me It ain't me, no I ain't no sinner, son It ain't me, no It ain't me, no I ain't the fortunate one Some folks are born silver spoons in their hand Lord, don't they help themselves
[00:10:03.982 --> 00:10:10.263]  I can't stress what a debt we owe Red Buckman.
[00:10:10.303 --> 00:10:18.745]  Since the fifties, educating the public about the New World Order's criminal actions, and then he discovered the Seventh Amendment.
[00:10:19.345 --> 00:10:27.447]  In the seventies he formed the Fully Informed Jury Association, and now a lot of people I talk to understand that
[00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:35.575]  You judge the facts as well as the law, and I want to go over this in basic terms for people, Red, because of all the great things you've done.
[00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:45.504]  I think this is the most profound and important, dealing with the rule of law and the power of the people, and our place in the hierarchy of power at the top, not the bottom, of this system.
[00:10:46.044 --> 00:10:51.088]  And so please, go back to what you were covering before we went to break about the Seventh Amendment.
[00:10:51.969 --> 00:11:00.853]  Not just dealing with your right to a jury trial, but to grand juries and to the power of the juries to instruct the judge, not the other way around.
[00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:03.734]  Let's go through this big secret for people.
[00:11:04.395 --> 00:11:07.256]  Well, let me read the 7th Amendment.
[00:11:08.076 --> 00:11:15.719]  It says, in suits of common law where the value in controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.
[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.561]  And that's what they teach in law school.
[00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:19.821]  And they stop there.
[00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:20.602]  They don't go on.
[00:11:22.132 --> 00:11:35.478]  This is what it says, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined by any court of the United States than according to rules of the common law.
[00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:47.963]  In other words, that Seventh Amendment common law jury trial, the judge, you see, he has a conflict of interest because he is a government employee
[00:11:48.789 --> 00:11:50.890]  Which makes him a government agent.
[00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:51.870]  Let's stop there.
[00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:52.591]  Let's stop there.
[00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:58.833]  I'm going to give you time, but I want to go back and flesh out the thunderbolt that is hiding in plain view.
[00:11:59.694 --> 00:12:15.881]  If we're a free country, of course it is the jurors who aren't some vestigial part, but that are at the center of the entire mechanism and who are the chief executives of the cities, counties, states, and the federal government.
[00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:17.702]  That is saying no court
[00:12:18.422 --> 00:12:19.822]  Can re-examine.
[00:12:19.862 --> 00:12:28.285]  That's saying there's no double jeopardy and that's saying that in findings that juries are above the Supreme Court.
[00:12:29.145 --> 00:12:29.786]  Absolutely.
[00:12:30.226 --> 00:12:30.846]  Absolutely.
[00:12:31.046 --> 00:12:43.250]  And you see the eminent domain case that came out of Connecticut, the Kelo case, you see there is a miscarriage of justice that should never have happened.
[00:12:44.289 --> 00:12:53.870]  Um, but you see the problem was that it was a bunch of lawyers that were arguing it and in common law you don't use lawyers
[00:12:54.608 --> 00:12:55.589]  To represent you.
[00:12:55.669 --> 00:12:57.069]  You represent yourself.
[00:12:57.189 --> 00:13:04.574]  And now under commerce law and all of these new admiralty systems that are really ancient Roman systems being brought in, there aren't even jurors.
[00:13:04.594 --> 00:13:08.256]  Like when the CPS comes and takes your child, there's no jury.
[00:13:08.336 --> 00:13:09.897]  There's a judge if you're lucky.
[00:13:10.297 --> 00:13:12.678]  Again, that's totally criminal, totally alien.
[00:13:12.938 --> 00:13:14.059]  But I interrupted you a minute ago.
[00:13:15.079 --> 00:13:19.182]  We had gotten to the point of who the courts and the prosecutors work for.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.820]  Yeah, right.
[00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:24.582]  They are government agents, and so they have a conflict of interest.
[00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:27.944]  Now, the founders of this country, let's go back now.
[00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:41.271]  The founders of this country had lived under King George III, and King George was using what we would call today administrative procedures.
[00:13:42.272 --> 00:13:47.695]  Now, when you invoke the Constitution, you're invoking the higher law.
[00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:53.491]  Uh, administrative procedures and the IRS, they use these all the time.
[00:13:54.092 --> 00:13:56.633]  They are rules and regulations.
[00:13:56.713 --> 00:13:57.593]  They're not law.
[00:13:58.314 --> 00:14:04.657]  They are rules and regulations that were created by public servants or government agents.
[00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:17.903]  So when you, uh, demand a seventh amendment, now we've been able to get people out of the tax, the grip of the tax court just by confronting them with the fact that the judge
[00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:31.905]  Has a conflict of interest, and he cannot make a finding of fact or a conclusion of law, because the Seventh Amendment doesn't give him any authority to do that.
[00:14:32.365 --> 00:14:41.549]  And so, you know, way back there in the freedom movement, we discovered that the judiciary was the biggest problem we had.
[00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:47.192]  They were more of a problem than the Congress or the executive branch.
[00:14:48.618 --> 00:14:50.719]  Um, and we knew they were a problem.
[00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:53.560]  We knew they were manipulating, uh, juries.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.380]  They were manipulating cases.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:11.724]  And, and this seventh amendment was put there by the founders because they had experienced the same kind of abuse, usurpation and abuse, uh, uh, abuse and usurpation of powers.
[00:15:12.004 --> 00:15:13.725]  That's what it says in the declaration.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.984]  It tells you that the judges and such of King George were out of line.
[00:15:20.084 --> 00:15:33.514]  And they had created swarms of new agencies and agents to go out and eat out the substance, to racketeer, to squeeze, to engage in piratical operations of booty-taking.
[00:15:34.154 --> 00:15:36.976]  Yeah, they say that you can't sue a federal judge.
[00:15:37.477 --> 00:15:38.518]  That is not true.
[00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:41.540]  You can sue a federal judge if
[00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:51.096]  If he does not notice the parties to an action, if it's a controversy between a citizen... Now, a corporation is different.
[00:15:51.636 --> 00:15:56.400]  The judge, he can do anything he wants with a corporation, because that's a creature created by the state.
[00:15:57.201 --> 00:16:00.985]  But you and I, we were created by a higher power.
[00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:03.307]  And a creator.
[00:16:03.787 --> 00:16:09.152]  And our rights come from our creator, not from government.
[00:16:10.994 --> 00:16:30.985]  And even if you don't believe in that and you're an atheist, the point is, it is the original organic law which was re-established under 1215 Magna Carta that is the dominant law that supersedes all new little rules and regulations set up by these little petty bureaucracies that under our system were outlawed.
[00:16:31.885 --> 00:16:39.169]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, when you confront a judge, a prosecutor,
[00:16:39.989 --> 00:16:45.252]  Or a bureaucrat of any kind, with the fact that they are government agents.
[00:16:45.553 --> 00:16:52.337]  A federal judge is as much a government agent as an FBI agent, or a CIA, or whatever.
[00:16:52.957 --> 00:17:00.322]  He is a government agent, and therefore, he has a conflict of interest.
[00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:03.924]  And the judges, they have a code of ethics.
[00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:09.053]  Which very specifically addresses conflicts of interest.
[00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.592]  Absolutely, and like I said earlier, we have been so miseducated, and we have been taught not nearly enough
[00:17:50.598 --> 00:17:58.684]  To where we can go into the court as a juror and understand how we're supposed to function, who we are.
[00:17:58.764 --> 00:18:18.558]  And as I wrote many years ago in my first book, one person, one informed person on a jury of 12 has more power than the president of the United States, more power than all of the Congress, more power than all of the judges in the courts, because we're sovereign.
[00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:19.799]  And see,
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:36.445]  There's something that we should have learned, and that is that no place in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights is our sovereignty identified like it is in the 7th Amendment.
[00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:41.007]  That's where our sovereignty is confirmed.
[00:18:41.387 --> 00:18:43.408]  That's where it is solidified.
[00:18:44.449 --> 00:18:45.329]  That's where
[00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.052]  It tells us about our power, how much power we have.
[00:18:50.172 --> 00:18:56.295]  But there were many other areas that also second that, like the Declaration of Independence and the Second Amendment.
[00:18:57.015 --> 00:19:11.863]  That gives us the authorization and the order to defend our friends, our family, our country, and the Declaration of Independence, the power as sovereigns to overthrow a system that has become corrupt, which they said would normally, that that would happen.
[00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:21.788]  But versus the new power that is just force majeure, whatever the better term is, of where they just say, hey, we have set the precedent.
[00:19:22.228 --> 00:19:30.212]  We have had notorious and obvious dominance over you, violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution, classical tyranny.
[00:19:30.572 --> 00:19:32.373]  They now just say, we don't care.
[00:19:32.873 --> 00:19:38.876]  You see, the problem is that they went to the same kind of schools that you and I went to, and they learned what they taught in a government school.
[00:19:58.644 --> 00:20:04.546]  Basically, our education system in this country is not an education system anymore.
[00:20:04.706 --> 00:20:04.946]  That's right.
[00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:07.547]  They're now teaching... It's programming.
[00:20:07.687 --> 00:20:08.167]  It's programming.
[00:20:08.187 --> 00:20:09.927]  They're now teaching the Second Amendment's a privilege.
[00:20:10.247 --> 00:20:11.368]  Traveling's a privilege.
[00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:13.808]  They're now teaching speech as a privilege.
[00:20:14.989 --> 00:20:16.569]  And I hear police saying this everywhere.
[00:20:16.689 --> 00:20:18.310]  I mean, the brainwashing's intensifying.
[00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.210]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:26.452]  A lot of those people know that the system is breaking down.
[00:20:27.023 --> 00:20:28.684]  And they don't know what to do about it.
[00:20:28.824 --> 00:20:30.945]  And we have to educate them.
[00:20:30.985 --> 00:20:35.547]  We have to explain to them how that we were miseducated.
[00:20:35.627 --> 00:20:38.088]  We were told lies and propaganda.
[00:20:38.769 --> 00:20:41.810]  And now we know how the system was supposed to function.
[00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.032]  And it's everybody's job, everybody in this country.
[00:20:46.072 --> 00:20:50.254]  We have a responsibility to bring this thing back.
[00:20:50.554 --> 00:20:51.955]  And I'm an optimist.
[00:20:52.015 --> 00:20:53.316]  I've been an optimist forever.
[00:20:53.996 --> 00:20:56.297]  And because it isn't any fun being a pessimist.
[00:20:56.963 --> 00:21:06.272]  Anyway, I think that there's a lot of government agents right today who are looking for an escape hatch.
[00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:16.661]  And we've got it, we've found it, and we're going to make it work, I think, if we can just get enough of this information spread around.
[00:21:18.663 --> 00:21:22.066]  You know, that sentence that I read to you out of that letter,
[00:21:24.355 --> 00:21:31.619]  The 7th Amendment, common law jury, is the highest court in the land because even the nine justices of the U.S.
[00:21:31.659 --> 00:21:33.360]  Supreme Court are government agents.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.502]  Anybody can understand that.
[00:21:37.702 --> 00:21:39.083]  When you call the U.S.
[00:21:39.123 --> 00:21:52.710]  Supreme Court judges, if you call them government agents, because they are government employees, they're beneficiaries of the tax laws, and those nine justices
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:22:02.113]  They went to the same kind of schools we did, and they were taught the same basic bunch of lies and propaganda.
[00:22:02.413 --> 00:22:05.338]  And so now, our U.S.
[00:22:05.398 --> 00:22:08.162]  Supreme Court judges are going to get an education.
[00:22:10.322 --> 00:22:14.966]  Now, I want to go back for people, because we're so close to the problem, Red, that we kind of skip ahead.
[00:22:15.706 --> 00:22:27.615]  Explain to folks how a jury and a grand jury is supposed to operate versus what they have been gelded and transformed into today.
[00:22:28.436 --> 00:22:31.598]  Well, let me go back to our miseducation.
[00:22:31.779 --> 00:22:35.842]  They taught us in high school, in government class.
[00:22:36.242 --> 00:22:40.045]  They called it civics when I went to school, and now they call it government classes.
[00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:46.838]  Uh, they taught us about the system of checks and balances, uh, up to a point.
[00:22:47.178 --> 00:23:00.586]  They taught us about the Congress, that they were to be a check against the executive and judicial branches of government, and the executive and, uh, branch were to be a check against the Congress and the judiciary, and back and forth.
[00:23:00.646 --> 00:23:01.546]  They taught us that.
[00:23:02.787 --> 00:23:07.670]  That's all they taught when they should have been teaching us that there were two more
[00:23:08.437 --> 00:23:14.000]  Very, very powerful and very important checks in the system.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.683]  The grand jury is to be a check against Congress.
[00:23:20.483 --> 00:23:24.125]  They are to be a check against the executive branch of government.
[00:23:24.165 --> 00:23:32.570]  That's right, they can haul in the congressmen and senators and the president as evidenced by a grand jury hauling Bill Clinton in, a grand jury from Arkansas.
[00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.350]  He had to answer.
[00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.011]  He had to answer the questions.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.624]  And the judiciary, they're not immune, they can be called in too.
[00:23:41.285 --> 00:23:51.994]  Now, you've got number four in the system of checks and balances, the grand jury, and number five is the pettit jury, the trial jury.
[00:23:53.436 --> 00:24:01.763]  And that jury, one informed person on that jury of 12 people, one person that is informed
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:07.082]  is far more powerful than the eleven who are misinformed.
[00:24:07.142 --> 00:24:20.288]  And that's why the National Bar Association seven years ago and five years ago and two years ago at their national conference, the first time in Chicago, called for abolishing juries and England is in the process of doing it.
[00:24:20.508 --> 00:24:28.832]  They have to remove, first they watered it down, made them creatures, bossed them around, turned them into these kept creatures,
[00:24:29.432 --> 00:24:31.673]  And then now, they're just getting rid of it wholesale.
[00:24:31.733 --> 00:24:33.414]  Again, showing the criminality, folks.
[00:24:35.255 --> 00:24:41.359]  Ron Paul, Congressman Ron Paul, who I met back about 1980, the first time.
[00:24:41.399 --> 00:24:43.620]  We've been on the platform many times together.
[00:24:46.042 --> 00:24:50.264]  He is supposed to have said that if it hadn't been for Red Beckman, we'd have lost the jury system.
[00:24:50.965 --> 00:24:58.008]  At this point in time, they're not going to be able to take the jury system away as much as they would love to take it away.
[00:24:58.088 --> 00:25:04.710]  I don't think they can do it for the simple reason... So they're just threatening and intimidating people into plea bargaining?
[00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:05.050]  Yes.
[00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.470]  Go ahead.
[00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:12.453]  Yes, but I think that we have an excellent opportunity.
[00:25:12.873 --> 00:25:16.114]  We're going to have an economic catastrophe happen.
[00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:18.290]  It's coming down.
[00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.870]  We're on a slippery slope.
[00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.772]  There's nothing to hang on to.
[00:25:23.052 --> 00:25:29.914]  We're going to go over the precipice here at some point, because we've let this thing go too long.
[00:25:30.675 --> 00:25:35.597]  But the thing is, we're going to have to pick up the pieces at some point.
[00:25:36.557 --> 00:25:43.000]  Now we have enough information so that we can pick up the pieces and put them back together again.
[00:25:43.857 --> 00:25:44.557]  And go on.
[00:25:44.777 --> 00:25:49.279]  And this is not anything unusual in history.
[00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:52.140]  This same thing has happened over and over again.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.621]  What goes around comes around.
[00:25:54.461 --> 00:26:00.683]  And we became lazy, mentally lazy, and mentally disabled in this country.
[00:26:00.964 --> 00:26:09.147]  But now, you know, back in the early 70s, I didn't know that there was people all over this country that thought like I did.
[00:26:09.807 --> 00:26:10.887]  And I was pretty lonely.
[00:26:11.087 --> 00:26:12.428]  But I'm not lonely anymore.
[00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:17.813]  Uh, there's a lot of people out there that are getting themselves informed.
[00:26:18.393 --> 00:26:21.534]  People at the grassroots, and they're the ones that we have to reach.
[00:26:21.615 --> 00:26:34.800]  They're the ones that have the power, and they may not make headlines, but they are making... Well, I've never seen a time in all my life where there's so many angry people.
[00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:41.338]  Um, the high gas prices, I guess, are a blessing in some ways because it's made a lot of Americans angry.
[00:26:41.518 --> 00:26:42.478]  Red, stay there.
[00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:43.439]  Gotta break again.
[00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:44.739]  Okay.
[00:26:44.839 --> 00:26:47.901]  And can we keep you at about 45 after next hour?
[00:26:49.281 --> 00:26:49.842]  I'll be here.
[00:26:50.222 --> 00:26:52.243]  Okay, good, because we'll talk another 30 minutes or so.
[00:26:52.663 --> 00:26:53.523]  Then we'll open the phones up.
[00:26:53.543 --> 00:26:56.225]  Then I've got a Chemtrail News story I'm going to play at the end of the show.
[00:26:56.245 --> 00:26:56.665]  Stay with us.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:04.186]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[00:27:04.306 --> 00:27:15.758]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying monthly cable or satellite fees.
[00:27:16.178 --> 00:27:17.019]  Here's the story.
[00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:25.184]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[00:27:25.484 --> 00:27:26.545]  And here's the best part.
[00:27:26.625 --> 00:27:27.926]  It's 100% legal.
[00:27:28.326 --> 00:27:34.431]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels and video feeds at your command.

[00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.512]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[00:28:00.652 --> 00:28:03.054]  I've come with a message of information.
[00:28:03.074 --> 00:28:05.676]  9-11 was an inside job.
[00:28:05.696 --> 00:28:06.857]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[00:28:06.877 --> 00:28:08.518]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[00:28:08.618 --> 00:28:11.420]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:15.143]  It wasn't engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR.
[00:28:24.785 --> 00:28:29.568]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11th, a global awakening has taken place.
[00:28:33.431 --> 00:28:34.492]  How dare you?
[00:28:36.073 --> 00:28:40.937]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[00:28:40.957 --> 00:28:43.759]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:50.023]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of... Truth Rising.

[00:28:55.427 --> 00:28:57.909]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[00:28:58.835 --> 00:29:00.697]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:00.837 --> 00:29:06.002]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.182 --> 00:29:07.523]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:07.803 --> 00:29:15.971]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.191 --> 00:29:21.916]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.096 --> 00:29:23.877]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:23.937 --> 00:29:26.118]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.238 --> 00:29:30.480]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.781]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:30:09.693 --> 00:30:36.564]  I wish a buck was still silver It was back when the country was strong Back before Elvis And before the Vietnam War came along Before the Beatles and yesterday
[00:30:39.642 --> 00:30:41.263]  Merle Haggard bringing us in.
[00:31:08.018 --> 00:31:10.583]  Well, we're definitely going to hell right now.
[00:31:10.624 --> 00:31:11.465]  This country's gone.
[00:31:11.505 --> 00:31:12.628]  Let's turn it around right now.
[00:31:12.648 --> 00:31:16.275]  But like Red was saying before the break...
[00:31:17.674 --> 00:31:18.454]  People are waking up.
[00:31:18.554 --> 00:31:25.376]  Red Beckman, one of the big granddaddies of... Ron Paul's giving him credit, yeah, for the jury system even still existing.
[00:31:25.996 --> 00:31:29.276]  You were getting into the fact that the New World Order is really starting to come to fruition.
[00:31:29.676 --> 00:31:36.878]  People like you have been around for half a century, in some cases, with Eustace Mullins even longer, telling people what's really happening.
[00:31:37.718 --> 00:31:45.520]  And so now we've got a lot of credibility and people are finally paying attention and giving us the respect that are due, especially the respect you're due, Red.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.560]  Please continue.
[00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:57.996]  Well, um, I just think that, um, uh, you know, great nations, um, are always so vulnerable from within.
[00:31:58.857 --> 00:32:00.778]  They're never destroyed from without.
[00:32:01.418 --> 00:32:15.105]  And, um, uh, we've always got every, every generation will have that, uh, uh, certain small percentage who think that they are better than anybody else.
[00:32:15.125 --> 00:32:16.746]  They're smarter than anybody else.
[00:32:17.675 --> 00:32:20.457]  And that they should rule.
[00:32:20.698 --> 00:32:23.900]  That they should govern and control people.
[00:32:26.122 --> 00:32:27.443]  I don't even think it's that, Red.
[00:32:27.463 --> 00:32:30.865]  They just want to be slave masters and dominate and be in control.
[00:32:31.446 --> 00:32:32.787]  They are mental cripples.
[00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:38.792]  We had them when the Constitution was formed.
[00:32:40.093 --> 00:32:44.496]  The ink wasn't dry on that Constitution, and they started making plans.
[00:32:45.226 --> 00:32:59.890]  As to how to subvert the Constitution, we had a serious constitutional crisis back there within 40 years of the ratification of the Constitution.
[00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:10.213]  And history tells us that there were about 600, we would call them newsletters today, they were hand-copied, they didn't have copy machines.
[00:33:10.899 --> 00:33:29.732]  There were about 600 newsletters, little newsletters, that started circulating amongst the states and they educated, they got the people to understand again how the system was supposed to work and they salvaged the system.
[00:33:30.327 --> 00:33:35.689]  However, it didn't take long, and we ended up in the Civil War, which was a total mistake.
[00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.191]  And the British financed that to get that going.
[00:33:38.771 --> 00:33:54.118]  Yes, and it was a total mistake, and we paid a terrible price for letting a bunch of outlaws tell us a bunch of lies and get us to believe those lies.
[00:33:55.093 --> 00:34:04.295]  And we recovered, we salvaged the thing, and we went on, and here we are now.
[00:34:05.276 --> 00:34:17.759]  You know, some of the material that I have seen indicates that as early as in the 1920s, we had people tampering with the curricula in our schools, in our government schools.
[00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:18.619]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:22.220]  And they're very patient.
[00:34:24.156 --> 00:34:28.618]  And they will work and work, you know, underhanded, subversive.
[00:34:29.098 --> 00:34:29.839]  Stay there, Rand.
[00:34:29.859 --> 00:34:31.940]  Gotta break again, back in just 70 seconds.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:33.400]  Absolutely.
[00:34:34.081 --> 00:34:37.322]  They have got to destroy the free mind and they've done a good job of it.

[00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:21.477]  The secret history of the United States, secret because it's not taught in the media or the schools, is all in this little citizen rulebook.
[00:36:21.537 --> 00:36:24.338]  We sell these at Infowars.com at cost.
[00:36:25.398 --> 00:36:25.859]  At cost.
[00:36:26.772 --> 00:36:30.494]  We buy them from the printer, and we sell them to you at cost.
[00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:36.398]  Every order of an in-game, a Terror Storm DVD, my new film, Truth Rising, we put one of these in.
[00:36:36.418 --> 00:36:38.440]  When you have a big order, we throw a handful of them in.
[00:36:40.154 --> 00:36:45.719]  Citizen Rulebook has a Declaration of Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights, famous quotes by Founding Fathers.
[00:36:46.219 --> 00:36:52.985]  There's a lot of Citizen Rulebooks out there, but this is the best because it has basically Red Beckman's info on the jury and the grand jury.
[00:36:53.785 --> 00:36:56.648]  This is the one put out by Outfit in Arizona.
[00:36:57.308 --> 00:37:01.211]  Bill of Rights, jury, handbook, the fireworks are in the document itself.
[00:37:01.732 --> 00:37:02.733]  Read the Constitution.
[00:37:02.813 --> 00:37:07.797]  Red, how important is this little Citizen's Rulebook in the 30 plus years it's been out?
[00:37:09.036 --> 00:37:19.219]  Well, I helped put that thing out, so I'm personally pretty well acquainted with it.
[00:37:19.759 --> 00:37:26.161]  It has so much good information in it, and it'll fit in anybody's shirt pocket.
[00:37:28.702 --> 00:37:35.944]  There is nothing that will terrorize judges and prosecutors and such as that.
[00:37:37.682 --> 00:37:45.168]  Then nothing will do anything more to terrorize them than if they see a prospective juror or a juror with that book.
[00:37:45.288 --> 00:37:51.753]  So you've got to be secretive about the fact that you're going in to be a good constitutional citizen because they're lawbreakers by design.
[00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:56.076]  I know people who cynically buy these from us when they don't want jury duty.
[00:37:56.116 --> 00:38:00.179]  They go in with it sticking out of their pocket and the prosecutor just says, you're out of here.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:01.220]  Right.
[00:38:01.721 --> 00:38:01.941]  Right.
[00:38:03.057 --> 00:38:06.539]  Uh, the prosecutors are well aware of that book.
[00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:31.009]  Now, if those prosecutors would listen, excuse me, if we could talk to them and explain this to them, they would soon come over to our side of this thing because, um, they know the system is unjust, that there is injustice, injustice every day.
[00:38:31.744 --> 00:38:57.121]  that is dished out in these courthouses and such and they know it and uh... and i'll tell ya if if they if they are violating their own conscience they're going to pay dearly at some point because there is a creator there is a there is a judgment uh... coming and uh... not just when you die read i found in my life
[00:38:58.866 --> 00:39:02.987]  Over and over again, that if I do bad things, they come back on me in a few months or a year.
[00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:06.367]  I mean, there is something to what comes around, goes around, re-plunges.
[00:39:06.707 --> 00:39:08.248]  So, you get it in this life, don't you?
[00:39:09.028 --> 00:39:09.668]  Absolutely.
[00:39:10.028 --> 00:39:14.609]  It can come around and bite severely.
[00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:17.069]  And of course, I have seen that.
[00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:18.410]  I've been around long enough.
[00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.730]  I have seen that happen to people.
[00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:25.071]  And, you know, I sued a federal judge.
[00:39:25.131 --> 00:39:25.711]  He is now
[00:39:27.973 --> 00:39:29.214]  He's in his demise.
[00:39:29.294 --> 00:39:31.494]  I think I contributed to it, perhaps.
[00:39:33.214 --> 00:39:42.576]  But, you know, they don't have a good life when they're fighting their own conscience, when they're violating their own conscience.
[00:39:44.057 --> 00:39:53.919]  That's why so many of them are alcoholics and drug addicts, because they've got to, you know, get enough alcohol in them at night to where they can go to bed and go to sleep.
[00:39:54.973 --> 00:40:01.194]  Uh, because they know, uh, that they're, um, you know, they're violating people every day.
[00:40:02.155 --> 00:40:04.955]  This plea bargaining thing, what a scam that is.
[00:40:05.735 --> 00:40:10.957]  And, uh, our prisons are full of, uh, people, innocent people, victimless crimes.
[00:40:11.737 --> 00:40:21.999]  And, uh, I'll tell you, um, the American people, uh, are paying a terrible high price for being miseducated.
[00:40:23.177 --> 00:40:23.998]  That's what it is.
[00:40:24.098 --> 00:40:25.379]  It's miseducation.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.664]  And it's not education, it's programming.
[00:40:43.559 --> 00:40:44.980]  Let me put something in here to Sensworth.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.161]  The New World Order.
[00:41:15.322 --> 00:41:16.803]  You just stop and think about it.
[00:41:16.843 --> 00:41:28.289]  There is no way that the New World Order can be brought in by a handful of scoundrels with a military conquest.
[00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:29.770]  It can't be done.
[00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.192]  It has to have acquiescence and an ignorant public.
[00:41:32.232 --> 00:41:34.653]  Yeah, but how do they plan to do it?
[00:41:34.813 --> 00:41:41.777]  Now, I figured this out many years ago when I spoke at an investors conference in Orlando, Florida.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.160]  I think so.
[00:42:08.168 --> 00:42:12.350]  I finally, when they opened it up for questions and such, after about an hour, I got the floor.
[00:42:13.311 --> 00:42:16.733]  And I said, you're not going to see $3,500 gold.
[00:42:17.113 --> 00:42:17.993]  I'm from the West.
[00:42:18.133 --> 00:42:20.034]  I know what's going on in the gold business.
[00:42:20.915 --> 00:42:24.677]  And gold was coming out of the ground at a rate never before in history.
[00:42:25.537 --> 00:42:27.818]  And I said, who's buying the gold?
[00:42:28.339 --> 00:42:34.442]  And I said, I'm going to tell you who's buying it, and I'm going to tell you what they're paying for it.
[00:42:35.502 --> 00:42:40.125]  And I explained how the Federal Reserve Bank, they go to the U.S.
[00:42:40.165 --> 00:42:49.570]  Printing Office, and in 1984, they were buying Federal Reserve $100 bills for 2.6 cents apiece.
[00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.691]  Today, they're a little over 5 cents.
[00:42:52.751 --> 00:42:54.292]  And gold was about $400.
[00:42:54.352 --> 00:42:57.234]  So the Fed was buying the gold in 1984 at about 10 cents an ounce.
[00:43:03.846 --> 00:43:14.637]  The, uh, stuff on the internet just last night, somebody had it on there that, uh, the powers that be, uh, have given up on bringing out the Amaro.
[00:43:16.042 --> 00:43:25.631]  And not only that, but they're saying that the powers that be, that the Euro is not as strong as it was, and I haven't followed that closely lately.
[00:43:25.651 --> 00:43:28.634]  Yeah, that was Robert Pasture, the big CFR guy.
[00:43:28.654 --> 00:43:29.715]  I say he's playing possum.
[00:43:29.935 --> 00:43:30.816]  They always do that.
[00:43:31.457 --> 00:43:34.279]  Oh yeah, they're giving you the propaganda.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.904]  But anyway, these scoundrels
[00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:44.876]  They are going to come out with an international monetary system.
[00:43:45.236 --> 00:43:46.297]  It'll be worldwide.
[00:43:46.377 --> 00:43:50.120]  It won't be regional like the Amaro or the Euro.
[00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.923]  It's going to be when we get into this.
[00:43:54.124 --> 00:43:56.305]  I'll tell you what, we're coming back to the full show right now.
[00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:58.107]  That was kind of a behind the scenes for our viewers.
[00:43:58.948 --> 00:44:00.169]  Recap, we're coming back right now.
[00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.592]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:44:05.862 --> 00:44:16.467]  All right, Red Beckman, you had just brought up Robert Pasture, the CFR minion, has said, oh, the North American Union's dead, too many people woke up to it and got mad about it, but they always say that.
[00:44:17.148 --> 00:44:25.232]  They go overt for a while, then they go covert when there's too much pressure, then they go public again, then they go secret again.
[00:44:26.252 --> 00:44:29.014]  Continue, sir, breaking down what you were saying about the New World Order.
[00:44:29.474 --> 00:44:33.736]  Yeah, well, what's going to happen, of course, is we're going to have an economic meltdown
[00:44:34.565 --> 00:44:46.475]  Here in the very near future, perhaps just weeks away, I'm not going to say when, but it's not going to be too far away because of the way the thing is falling apart.
[00:44:47.335 --> 00:44:55.562]  And when they do, when this meltdown happens, they're going to come up with an international monetary system backed by gold.
[00:44:55.642 --> 00:44:58.404]  And I can just about guarantee you that 100%.
[00:44:58.465 --> 00:44:58.925]  And when they do,
[00:45:02.034 --> 00:45:21.842]  This is how your New World Order is going to come in, because if they control the money, and of course I said in 84 that they were going to destroy the dollar, they were going to destroy the Japanese yen, they were going to destroy the douche mark and the Swiss franc, and all of them are being destroyed, especially the dollar today.
[00:45:23.022 --> 00:45:29.265]  And they're going to issue an international monetary system backed by gold,
[00:45:30.223 --> 00:45:36.626]  And it will finish off every currency on the face of the earth, and you're going to have your new world order.
[00:45:36.726 --> 00:45:41.028]  And that's why they've been hoarding the gold to bring in their world-backed currency.
[00:45:41.388 --> 00:45:49.391]  That's what the banking expert who's been a banker who made the Money Masters DVD film, he's been saying that's their plan.
[00:45:50.392 --> 00:45:53.373]  Yep, and it's coming at warp speed.
[00:45:57.162 --> 00:45:57.923]  Please continue.
[00:45:57.983 --> 00:46:00.384]  How do we protect ourselves, in your opinion?
[00:46:01.005 --> 00:46:08.971]  I'm telling people to make sure that they've got some food supply, and of course, keep their powder dry.
[00:46:09.871 --> 00:46:16.736]  And when this thing starts to really get serious, meltdown, people are going to go hungry.
[00:46:17.016 --> 00:46:19.078]  And when they get hungry, you don't know what they're going to do.
[00:46:20.163 --> 00:46:25.787]  So you make sure... Red, red, red, that's scary because you did predict what happened to the Japanese.
[00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:27.088]  You predicted other things that happened.
[00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:31.392]  Because you've been studying this so long, you get a deep feel for what they're up to.
[00:46:31.432 --> 00:46:32.993]  In fact, I've never seen you be wrong.
[00:46:33.493 --> 00:46:35.835]  I mean, have you ever been wrong before on a big prediction?
[00:46:35.855 --> 00:46:43.401]  Boy, I don't think so on this stuff, on this kind of information.
[00:46:45.133 --> 00:46:46.934]  I've studied it for a long time.
[00:46:47.814 --> 00:46:50.315]  Like I say, I'm going to be 80 here pretty shortly.
[00:46:52.235 --> 00:46:53.196]  I've seen the 30s.
[00:46:53.296 --> 00:47:00.698]  I know what happened then, and of course what happened in the 30s was a Sunday school picnic compared to what we're coming up to.
[00:47:01.988 --> 00:47:07.272]  In the 1930s, everybody helped everybody else.
[00:47:07.432 --> 00:47:16.077]  And 80% plus was rural and self-sufficient, and still, they just put out a big university study last month, 7.5 million people starved to death.
[00:47:16.998 --> 00:47:23.242]  Now, we've got 90% are urban, only half of the 10% that are rural are self-sufficient.
[00:47:23.262 --> 00:47:26.344]  This is a recipe, if it does happen, for complete meltdown.
[00:47:27.131 --> 00:47:37.315]  It is, but you better be prepared to protect yourself and your family and your resources.
[00:47:38.295 --> 00:47:48.419]  And get out of sight if you can, because we need informed people to pick up the pieces.
[00:47:49.879 --> 00:47:54.661]  We need people that understand about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:47:55.753 --> 00:47:58.415]  We don't want to trashcan that.
[00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:02.156]  We don't want them writing a new constitution.
[00:48:02.737 --> 00:48:03.577]  We don't want that.
[00:48:05.838 --> 00:48:11.641]  The constitution that we have is such a great document.
[00:48:12.021 --> 00:48:15.303]  There's very little that I would ever recommend changing.
[00:48:15.383 --> 00:48:22.286]  The only thing that I would like to see is a list of words and their definitions.
[00:48:24.122 --> 00:48:32.147]  Because the Supreme Court and all of the courts, they've had a tendency to try to change the definitions of words, of keywords.
[00:48:32.207 --> 00:48:36.409]  And the founders said, you don't try to invent things, don't try to twist meanings out.
[00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:42.673]  It's clear what all this means, and they all wrote statements and had debates, and it was clear what all of the amendments meant.
[00:48:43.373 --> 00:48:47.636]  Yes, and of course, like I said earlier,
[00:48:48.568 --> 00:49:13.577]  uh... the legal profession has been a serious problem and because it's uh... basically it's controlled out of london england and uh... they have tried to bury the seventh amendment uh... and they've been pretty successful it's fallen through the cracks uh... and uh... we've we've drug it back up out of there and now we just need people all over this country uh... that will uh...
[00:49:14.506 --> 00:49:27.191]  You know that we'll pick up on this and study that Seventh Amendment and what it means, and we've got a couple of law professors in a couple of law schools that are starting to study this, and that's a good sign.
[00:49:27.832 --> 00:49:29.752]  That's a good thing to happen.
[00:49:30.453 --> 00:49:38.376]  And so, and of course, in the past you've always let me give a little pitch on my books.
[00:49:39.436 --> 00:49:40.397]  Yeah, do that.
[00:49:41.135 --> 00:49:54.804]  That little book, Walls and Our Minds, I have sent it out to quite a number of people from the pitch that you've allowed on the show, and I'll do that again.
[00:49:56.606 --> 00:50:00.728]  I'll send that little book, Walls and Our Minds, to anybody that sends $5.
[00:50:00.969 --> 00:50:10.315]  I used to say anybody that sends $3, but I want to include some other material with it.
[00:50:11.185 --> 00:50:15.709]  Uh, particularly this letter that has been shutting the Internal Revenue Service off.
[00:50:15.769 --> 00:50:17.670]  I mean, it's just shutting them down.
[00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:33.743]  Uh, because when it was the federal judges that created the IRS as a terrorist organization, they are the ones who created this psychoterrorist organization because they've been prosecuting people in the courts in a, in a, in a show trial.
[00:50:33.923 --> 00:50:35.244]  These have been show trials.
[00:50:36.228 --> 00:50:42.552]  And the people on the juries are uninformed, miseducated, and so we've got people who are good people.
[00:50:42.692 --> 00:50:46.735]  And let me just add, before you get back into this before I forget, that I loved it.
[00:50:46.775 --> 00:50:50.337]  Ron Paul last year, late last year, was on a national television show.
[00:50:50.357 --> 00:50:51.278]  It was Fox News.
[00:50:51.838 --> 00:50:53.740]  And they said, you want to get rid of the income tax.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.680]  How are we going to live?
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.721]  How are we going to have a government?
[00:50:56.261 --> 00:51:02.825]  And Ron Paul said, that Capitol right behind me, he was at the Capitol, it was built before we had an income tax.
[00:51:02.865 --> 00:51:04.627]  We have scores of other constitutional
[00:51:05.307 --> 00:51:05.527]  Yeah.
[00:51:23.184 --> 00:51:29.488]  Need CPS kidnapping 1.4 million children with no due process in kangaroo false courts, these family courts.
[00:51:30.088 --> 00:51:39.653]  All this is new and it's horrible and we all know it's horrible, but it isn't just staying at one point where it's bad, it's growing like a malignant 50 pound tumor.
[00:51:39.693 --> 00:51:51.660]  Yeah, and we can change it now using the 7th Amendment with civil lawsuits and when you have a civil lawsuit against a bureaucrat or whatever,
[00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:57.192]  The jury determines the constitutionality of their law.
[00:51:57.212 --> 00:51:58.613]  Okay, now they claim they're immune.
[00:51:58.653 --> 00:52:00.735]  Explain how that's a fraud and do your pitch.
[00:52:00.755 --> 00:52:03.397]  You've got the floor until we go to break in five minutes.
[00:52:04.177 --> 00:52:06.219]  There is no immunity.
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.462]  The Constitution gives no immunity to no one.
[00:52:11.402 --> 00:52:14.745]  And there's nothing sacred about a public servant.
[00:52:14.985 --> 00:52:16.626]  I don't care who they work for.
[00:52:17.447 --> 00:52:20.429]  And you see, it was judges in the courts
[00:52:21.249 --> 00:52:27.212]  That said, that these child protective people have an immunity.
[00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.993]  Where did the judge get the authority to say that?
[00:52:31.914 --> 00:52:33.715]  He doesn't have that authority.
[00:52:34.035 --> 00:52:37.276]  He's got a conflict of interest because he is a government agent.
[00:52:37.977 --> 00:52:40.838]  Just like the child protective man.
[00:52:40.858 --> 00:52:42.218]  They're individual.
[00:52:42.799 --> 00:52:45.420]  And so, this thing can be shut down.
[00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:47.661]  That game has got to stop.
[00:52:51.112 --> 00:52:51.692]  We can do it.
[00:52:51.712 --> 00:52:58.215]  Go ahead and continue talking, sir.
[00:52:58.915 --> 00:53:04.918]  Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, there is so many things out there.
[00:53:06.019 --> 00:53:18.364]  All of this zoning and planning, I've been going through this with a new home, and the county and the state
[00:53:19.408 --> 00:53:28.232]  They put in all these rules and regulations, and I told one of these engineers, I said, you're forgetting something.
[00:53:29.012 --> 00:53:30.452]  I'm the king in this castle.
[00:53:30.973 --> 00:53:45.418]  I own this property, and I'll tell you what I'm going to do, and you can approve it or not, but you're going to have to come to the conclusion that you're just a public servant, and you're going to have to understand that.
[00:53:46.238 --> 00:53:55.481]  And I'm not about to let the state tell me what I can do and what I can't do as long as I'm not infringing on somebody else's rights.
[00:53:56.181 --> 00:53:56.861]  Keep going, Red.
[00:53:56.901 --> 00:53:58.082]  I told you, you got the floor.
[00:54:00.102 --> 00:54:11.046]  Well, I'll tell you, I didn't really think about going this long, but of course I really appreciate the privilege.
[00:54:12.794 --> 00:54:26.664]  And so I think that perhaps going back and talking about how people need to make preparations for this meltdown that's coming.
[00:54:28.645 --> 00:54:33.889]  Food is the key, and it's the most important thing.
[00:54:34.149 --> 00:54:37.851]  And if you're in a big city, I'll tell you,
[00:54:39.345 --> 00:54:57.838]  I don't want to be in a big city because some of the anthropologists are saying that if the food distribution system breaks down in this country, and most of it is moved by independent truckers, and if they can't get their money for their loads, they are out of business.
[00:54:59.119 --> 00:55:04.903]  And the food distribution system is going to be one of the first things to go.
[00:55:05.203 --> 00:55:06.885]  Well, Red, I've had you on.
[00:55:07.864 --> 00:55:11.866]  Probably ten times over the years and never heard you talk about preparedness and things like this.
[00:55:12.446 --> 00:55:15.868]  You've got a keen mind for the future.
[00:55:16.248 --> 00:55:17.468]  You really think this is it?
[00:55:17.508 --> 00:55:25.412]  I mean, every financial expert I have on say within two and a half, three years guaranteed depression, but you're saying you think it might be even sooner.
[00:55:26.392 --> 00:55:36.797]  Oh, I think that all of the indications, as long as we've got the kind of outlaws that we've got in Washington right now.
[00:55:37.971 --> 00:55:48.038]  uh... that uh... uh... they want this power and they're exercising power everyday that is not theirs and it's usurped power.
[00:55:48.638 --> 00:55:50.419]  So you see them going for it?
[00:55:50.979 --> 00:55:52.480]  Red, you see them going for it?
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.884]  I'm going to skip this break for everybody watching on PrisonPlanet.tv and listening on the InfoWars.com streams.
[00:55:59.165 --> 00:56:00.485]  Red, continue, continue.
[00:56:00.666 --> 00:56:01.946]  You've got the floor for four minutes.
[00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:05.849]  I mean, explain to people what you see coming down.
[00:56:07.205 --> 00:56:09.306]  Well, it's going to get ugly.
[00:56:10.167 --> 00:56:11.868]  It's going to get very ugly.
[00:56:12.548 --> 00:56:31.779]  And we don't know what the reaction is going to be of the masses, and particularly in the large cities, where very few people can put a meal on the table in their residence without going down to the deli or to the grocery store.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.161]  And these people are so vulnerable.
[00:56:37.369 --> 00:56:44.655]  With gas prices so high and everything, and that's not an accident, they're not going to be able to get out of town.
[00:56:45.816 --> 00:57:00.007]  And the anthropologists, some of them are saying that if the food distribution system breaks down, that we could have cannibalism in our large metropolitan centers within five days.
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.041]  That's not a very long period of time.
[00:57:04.362 --> 00:57:17.811]  And so, the food, the warehouses that are servicing the major metropolitan areas don't have all that much food in their warehouses.
[00:57:18.651 --> 00:57:20.792]  It comes and goes on a daily basis.
[00:57:21.693 --> 00:57:27.137]  Now, Red, as we enter into these dangerous waters that have been organized by design,
[00:57:28.382 --> 00:57:38.250]  It isn't just that 80% of people lived on farms and were self-sufficient during the 8-9 year depression and still millions starved to death and tens of millions lost their homes.
[00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:45.915]  By design, the bankers consolidated most of the West and many areas of the Central and Eastern part of the United States.
[00:57:46.696 --> 00:57:48.838]  But they had been through hardship before.
[00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:49.678]  They were tougher.
[00:57:50.139 --> 00:57:50.959]  They came from
[00:57:52.071 --> 00:57:55.995]  Just a generation before that were frontiers people, really tough.
[00:57:56.015 --> 00:57:58.657]  I mean my ancestors were tough here in Texas compared to me.
[00:57:58.698 --> 00:58:07.366]  My dad knows light years more about, and he's a doctor, but fixing tractors and doing work and having to fix things and how to grow things and not eating that much.
[00:58:07.746 --> 00:58:12.051]  And my grandfathers were a lot tougher than even I am and I'm a lot tougher than most people around today.
[00:58:13.311 --> 00:58:17.352]  And so, it's not just that they don't have the resources, they're not ready for a crisis.
[00:58:17.953 --> 00:58:25.635]  They are so apathetic and decadent, and so many of them are in denial still, Red, so I see it being that much worse.
[00:58:26.455 --> 00:58:27.136]  Absolutely.
[00:58:29.096 --> 00:58:38.279]  And it just, you know, it could make a person ill just thinking about it, and you could go stick your head in the sand.
[00:58:39.553 --> 00:58:41.874]  Um, and, and wait for it to happen.
[00:58:41.954 --> 00:58:44.976]  But, uh, that's a terrible mistake at this point.
[00:58:45.156 --> 00:58:52.560]  And, uh, you see, of course, uh, one of the things that I've watched so close and that is the gun control thing.
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:59:03.725]  Um, the, um, the scoundrels, um, you know, they've got a real problem because they have not been able to get the guns away from the American people.
[00:59:04.766 --> 00:59:07.667]  And, uh, it's going to be a factor.
[00:59:08.442 --> 00:59:12.084]  A major factor in what happens here in the days ahead.
[00:59:13.746 --> 00:59:18.489]  You know, and of course, like I said, we're on such a slippery slope right now.
[00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:23.312]  And the slope is getting steeper every day.
[00:59:24.273 --> 00:59:27.735]  And so, you know, it's going to come down.
[00:59:28.215 --> 00:59:29.216]  It's going to happen.
[00:59:29.656 --> 00:59:34.299]  And let's get what we can prepared.
[00:59:37.555 --> 00:59:39.456]  Make sure, like I say, it's the food.
[00:59:40.016 --> 00:59:44.157]  It's the food thing, and you've got to worry about your children and your grandchildren.
[00:59:44.377 --> 00:59:46.197]  Okay, Red, we're coming back to the full audience.
[00:59:46.237 --> 00:59:52.718]  This has been four minutes with tens of thousands of internet listeners and viewers, but now we're going to come back to the main AM and FM dial.
[00:59:53.379 --> 00:59:58.780]  I am going to give you the complete floor for five minutes, then we're going to come back and take calls in the final segment.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.080]  And I turned my mic off.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.301]  That's the only way I'm learning to control myself and let my guests talk.
[01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:06.985]  So this is Alex Jones controlling himself.
[01:00:07.366 --> 01:00:10.552]  We're going to come back and I want you to talk about whatever you want and give your pitch.
[01:00:10.592 --> 01:00:10.912]  Here we go.
[01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:22.763]  Your chance to talk to Red Beckman in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:22.783 --> 01:00:23.964]  Jeff, Maria, Dennis, C.H., Omar and others.
[01:00:23.984 --> 01:00:24.244]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:24.304 --> 01:00:28.487]  Red, you keep talking about in the weeks to come, and I've never heard you talk like this,
[01:00:38.394 --> 01:00:43.778]  Ron Paul said two weeks ago that something big is about to happen that will basically end liberty in this country.
[01:00:44.219 --> 01:00:48.622]  I had him on last week and he said economic collapse could now happen any week, any month.
[01:00:50.363 --> 01:00:53.866]  He's likened it before to a medical thing where somebody's about to have a heart attack.
[01:00:53.886 --> 01:00:59.310]  You know, the doctor says it may be a month, it may be in a year, but you're going to die of a heart failure pretty soon, your heart's shot.
[01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:03.354]  Why are you saying, you know, any week?
[01:01:03.674 --> 01:01:06.176]  I mean, is there something you know and then anything else you want to add?
[01:01:07.392 --> 01:01:14.276]  Well, it's not just what I know, it's what I see happening on a daily basis.
[01:01:14.556 --> 01:01:19.920]  And I see the acceleration.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:24.022]  It's the acceleration of things happening so rapidly.
[01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:31.467]  And so, you know, I could fill your five minutes with stuff, but
[01:01:32.353 --> 01:01:41.636]  I would like to have people order my little book, Walls and Our Minds, and I'll send them that extra material if they send me $5 and it's Common Sense Press.
[01:01:41.977 --> 01:01:45.578]  The address is Common Sense Press.
[01:01:46.058 --> 01:01:49.119]  Well, make it just Red Beckman.
[01:01:49.499 --> 01:01:50.199]  That's simpler.
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.081]  Just make it Red Beckman, P.O.
[01:01:53.141 --> 01:01:56.842]  Box 61, Carrolls, Washington.
[01:01:56.982 --> 01:01:58.703]  C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S.
[01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:12.080]  I'm Washington and it's 98609 and I want you to get the book because in the book I explain the difference between a politician and a statesman.
[01:02:13.061 --> 01:02:17.366]  I explain the difference between true patriotism and false patriotism.
[01:02:18.066 --> 01:02:24.613]  True patriotism is where people put their patriotism, they focus it on their country.
[01:02:25.464 --> 01:02:33.369]  False patriotism is where people put all their hopes and everything on the government.
[01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.972]  Their patriotism is focused on the government.
[01:02:37.612 --> 01:02:43.516]  This is what got the people in Germany in trouble with the Nazis.
[01:02:44.017 --> 01:02:48.560]  Germany was the first nation to be conquered by the Nazis in World War II.
[01:02:52.759 --> 01:02:54.721]  Don't put your allegiance to government.
[01:02:54.861 --> 01:02:58.343]  Put your allegiance to the United States of America, the country.
[01:02:58.944 --> 01:03:02.086]  The country will be here when this government is gone.
[01:03:03.227 --> 01:03:04.568]  Germany is still there.
[01:03:05.028 --> 01:03:10.452]  Germany was devastated by a couple of different governments in the first half of the 20th century.
[01:03:11.332 --> 01:03:12.513]  Germany is still there.
[01:03:12.894 --> 01:03:16.176]  Italy has had over 40 different governments since World War II.
[01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:19.989]  Over 40 different governments.
[01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:28.251]  Italy is still there, and you hardly ever see anything in the news about Italy because everything in Italy is working quite well.
[01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:33.893]  And the people are very content, they have a good economy and all, and you see, you don't hear about them.
[01:03:34.264 --> 01:03:40.068]  But they've had governments, one right after another, and the people make jokes about their government.
[01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.969]  They don't let the government dictate that.
[01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:42.389]  That's right.
[01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:47.653]  Overseas, especially in Italy and places, they've learned to hate their government and not trust their government.
[01:03:47.973 --> 01:03:49.754]  And from that, things get a lot better.
[01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:53.677]  But every time you start worshipping government, it gets real bad, folks.
[01:03:54.157 --> 01:03:58.560]  When you trust government, if you trust government, you're just asking for trouble.
[01:03:59.201 --> 01:04:04.024]  You're going to pay a high price if you're trusting government.
[01:04:05.144 --> 01:04:11.189]  And so, that's why we have a Constitution and Bill of Rights, because the Founders said, you don't trust government.
[01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:14.992]  You have a government of law, not men.
[01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:19.856]  You see, that's one of the little phrases that has been perverted.
[01:04:21.037 --> 01:04:26.882]  You get in court and they'll say, the judge will very piously say, well, we're a nation of law, not men.
[01:04:28.023 --> 01:04:28.363]  No, no.
[01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:32.367]  We were to have a government of law, not men.
[01:04:33.854 --> 01:04:34.835]  They perverted that.
[01:04:47.355 --> 01:04:52.319]  To see Bush, the puppet, saying there's no Fourth Amendment.
[01:04:52.359 --> 01:04:57.062]  To see airport scanners that scan your naked body and behavioral profiling.
[01:04:57.343 --> 01:05:01.466]  To see SWAT teams going into the wrong house and shooting babies and they don't even get in trouble.
[01:05:02.126 --> 01:05:05.188]  Or to see police go beat people up and then not get in trouble.
[01:05:05.229 --> 01:05:05.749]  I mean, what is it?
[01:05:05.769 --> 01:05:07.550]  I mean, it's getting really bad.
[01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:12.214]  And then meanwhile, the illegal aliens are all above the law and the police admit they're told not to arrest them.
[01:05:13.348 --> 01:05:25.251]  Well, uh, you see, we had to have the illegal aliens come in because, uh, we have murdered 40 to 50 million of our workforce in the abortion clinics.
[01:05:26.371 --> 01:05:32.153]  And so they had to replace those with people, uh, that will do this kind of labor.
[01:05:33.293 --> 01:05:40.875]  Um, you see, uh, 1973 was when Roe v. Wade came down and, uh, see those people,
[01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:48.532]  That were aborted back there would be very much in evidence in our workforce today.
[01:05:49.292 --> 01:05:58.455]  But the scoundrels, of course, you see, they wanted to bring in these illegal aliens because they would worship the government.
[01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:06.338]  If they're getting free medical and, you know, the welfare,
[01:06:07.503 --> 01:06:12.928]  And all of that, that's a lot better than living in a government.
[01:06:13.128 --> 01:06:17.251]  Exactly, that's a lot better than growing up in a cardboard box outside Mexico City.
[01:06:18.312 --> 01:06:29.100]  And so yeah, plus they're allowed to have their nationalism, that's instilled in them, but Americans, we can't have our nationalism unless it's a perverted form of let's go murder some Iraqis.
[01:06:29.895 --> 01:06:30.916]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:31.416 --> 01:06:44.325]  And of course, you know, most of us that keep an eye on things, we recognized that the Bush administration was giving us a line of lies and misinformation.
[01:06:44.985 --> 01:06:54.152]  And that, you know, people called me before our military went in there with their invasion and they said, what's your take on this?
[01:06:54.232 --> 01:06:59.115]  And I said, well, I said, our military will go through their military.
[01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:00.170]  We're good to go.
[01:07:24.252 --> 01:07:28.834]  Yeah, they are not an American yuppie that just flies with the wind like Flotsam and Jetsam.
[01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:31.736]  You are not going to conquer their minds.
[01:07:32.776 --> 01:07:34.757]  No, it isn't going to happen.
[01:07:37.118 --> 01:07:45.522]  Religion is a terrible thing because it just absolutely dominates people's lives and their minds.
[01:07:46.462 --> 01:07:51.985]  And if they get misdirected, they become very dangerous.
[01:07:55.265 --> 01:08:14.069]  Red, we're going to come back out into a final segment and take some phone calls on the other side, but before we do that, in about one minute, I want to get your response to 9-11 and government-sponsored terrorism, because I don't think in the last, I think you've been on after 9-11, I think five years ago was the last time you were on, but I don't think I brought it up.
[01:08:14.209 --> 01:08:15.650]  It's been quite a while, yes.
[01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:16.950]  I've been down health-wise.
[01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:18.430]  You've been what?
[01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.391]  I've been down health-wise.
[01:08:21.684 --> 01:08:29.089]  I've been having some serious health problems and so I've been pretty much out of circulation on the speaker store and that type of thing.
[01:08:29.809 --> 01:08:34.673]  But I saw you back at an event a few weeks ago, so I guess you're doing better?
[01:08:35.373 --> 01:08:36.054]  I'm doing better.
[01:08:36.254 --> 01:08:37.475]  I got off of the Vioxx.
[01:08:41.627 --> 01:08:47.350]  They had me on prednisone and Celebrex and Bextra and Vioxx and methotrexate.
[01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:48.670]  Why were you believing them?
[01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:49.971]  I mean, you know that stuff will kill you.
[01:08:50.051 --> 01:09:01.756]  Well, I spent quite a bit of time in the hospital in 2003 because I was down pretty seriously and I didn't think I was going to survive it.
[01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:03.277]  But I did.
[01:09:03.377 --> 01:09:07.539]  I've been off of all the prescription medication now for over three years.
[01:09:08.686 --> 01:09:09.947]  Wow, okay, here we go.
[01:09:10.567 --> 01:09:11.287]  Final segment.
[01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:12.328]  We're glad you're doing better.
[01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:18.791]  Alright, I'm going to take some calls for Red Beckman.
[01:09:19.011 --> 01:09:25.174]  Huge news just got brought in to me that I'll be covering when he leaves us.
[01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.515]  You're going to have a little chemtrail clip I want to play.
[01:09:27.535 --> 01:09:31.057]  Hell, they're flaunting it in our face on mainstream news.
[01:09:32.137 --> 01:09:34.098]  This is amazing when I was just given by Aaron.
[01:09:36.519 --> 01:09:39.801]  Red Beckman, your take on government-sponsored terror, Oklahoma City, 9-11.
[01:09:40.582 --> 01:09:42.403]  From your research, are those inside jobs?
[01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:43.884]  Absolutely.
[01:09:47.347 --> 01:09:51.029]  Both of them had all the earmarks.
[01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:57.494]  It didn't come hard to see through that.
[01:09:59.115 --> 01:10:02.178]  When 9-11 came, I was called.
[01:10:02.238 --> 01:10:05.520]  I never turn my television on in the morning, but a lady called and said,
[01:10:06.249 --> 01:10:07.690]  Red, turn your television on.
[01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:17.457]  So I got to see the plane hit the second building, and I told the lady on the phone, I said, the world will never be the same again.
[01:10:18.538 --> 01:10:21.039]  And it never will be.
[01:10:24.326 --> 01:10:32.770]  Speaking of that, it's going up on JonesReport.com right now, and I'm going to have Steve Watson and Curt Nemo do a story on this.
[01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:40.614]  I am linking through to double-check all this, but Sy Hersh has reported how they've dressed up Al-Qaeda operatives
[01:10:42.034 --> 01:10:43.615]  And sent him in, the U.S.
[01:10:43.635 --> 01:10:54.181]  now admitted this four years after he reported it, to attack Iran out of Iraq, which Iran's Shiite, and then the news says they're Al-Qaeda, when Al-Qaeda is Sunni.
[01:10:54.201 --> 01:10:56.042]  That's how dumb they think the public is.
[01:10:57.042 --> 01:11:05.287]  And it says, ThinkProgress reporting on this, but they've got video links to it, Campus Progress Journalism Conference, Pulitzer Prize winner,
[01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:12.474]  This is going up on JonesReport.com right now.
[01:11:12.514 --> 01:11:13.515]  He's posting it right now.
[01:11:14.356 --> 01:11:22.865]  It says, to provoke war, Cheney considered proposal to dress up Navy SEALs as Iranians and shoot at them, and then of course get video of that for the public.
[01:11:23.425 --> 01:11:35.896]  Speaking at the Campus Progress Journalism Conference earlier this month, Seymour Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist in New York, revealed the Bush Administration officials held a secret meeting recently in the Vice President's office to discuss ways to provoke war with Iran.
[01:11:36.276 --> 01:11:39.999]  And Hersh's most recent article reports that the meeting occurred in the wake of the overblown incident.
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:40.800]  Yeah.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:40.920]  Yeah.
[01:11:57.031 --> 01:12:06.221]  Between Tehran and Washington, according to one of Hirsch's sources, and Hirsch is another person who's always been, just since Vietnam, he has the sources, he is the man.
[01:12:06.802 --> 01:12:11.467]  During the journalism conference event, Hirsch has specifically talked about his meeting
[01:12:12.648 --> 01:12:14.269]  If he could elaborate on what occurred.
[01:12:14.309 --> 01:12:16.670]  Hirsch explained that, during the meeting, I want this writer on.
[01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:18.290]  In Cheney's office.
[01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:19.231]  It'll be on tomorrow, folks.
[01:12:19.691 --> 01:12:25.073]  An idea was considered to dress up Navy SEALs as Iranians and put them on fake Iranian speedboats and shoot at them.
[01:12:25.393 --> 01:12:28.955]  This idea intended to provoke war with Iran, which ultimately was rejected.
[01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:39.779]  Hirsch said, this is reportedly on tape, there are dozens of ideas proffered about how to trigger a war, that the one that interested me the most was, why don't we build
[01:12:41.021 --> 01:12:42.242]  We're in our own shipyard.
[01:12:43.142 --> 01:12:52.269]  Build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats, put Navy SEALs on them with lots of arms, and next time one of our boats goes to trade for a moose, start a shoot-up.
[01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:59.033]  Just like... Well, I mean, right around this same time, Gary Hart wrote a letter to Tehran saying the U.S.
[01:12:59.073 --> 01:13:01.014]  government will stage a Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:13:02.035 --> 01:13:05.157]  And it goes on here.
[01:13:05.197 --> 01:13:09.080]  This is an incredible... This just gets crazier and crazier, doesn't it?
[01:13:11.893 --> 01:13:13.414]  Um, there's a desperation.
[01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:33.547]  Uh, I think there's almost a panic on the part of the Bush administration and Cheney and those guys because, um, they're not able to, um, to come up with this, but what there's people that digest the information and, um, and, and figure out what they're really trying to do.
[01:13:33.627 --> 01:13:38.210]  And then they broadcast it, the, the, the internet and, and the computers.
[01:13:39.411 --> 01:13:54.382]  Um, the, um, the, uh, radio talk shows such as yours and such, it makes information available to the people and they can't, they just can't do what they used to do, uh, without getting exposed.
[01:13:55.363 --> 01:13:56.384]  I think they're in a panic.
[01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:00.370]  Red, you're absolutely right.
[01:14:01.251 --> 01:14:03.491]  I am here while you're talking, reading the rest of this.
[01:14:03.511 --> 01:14:04.952]  There's actually a YouTube video.
[01:14:06.072 --> 01:14:09.593]  He said this weeks ago, and this is just now coming out.
[01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:12.434]  I mean, there's so much evil, we can't even cover it all.
[01:14:13.134 --> 01:14:19.196]  Cy Hirst said the New Yorker decided not to run with the story because the White House decided not to stage the event.
[01:14:19.617 --> 01:14:23.798]  That is outrageous that the New Yorker magazine knew about this meeting.
[01:14:24.378 --> 01:14:29.339]  And had witnesses to this, but even Sy Hersh wasn't basically allowed to run with it.
[01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:36.661]  Well, because the New Yorker said, I'm reading it right here, said, well, they didn't stage that, so we're not going to report on it.
[01:14:36.801 --> 01:14:37.881]  This is incredible, Red.
[01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:52.684]  They are in a panic, and of course, you see, they've let this thing get away on the economic plane, and now it's out of their, there's no way.
[01:14:53.328 --> 01:14:56.470]  There's no way that they can pull this thing out of the fire.
[01:14:57.831 --> 01:15:03.014]  It's going to swallow them in the process.
[01:15:03.974 --> 01:15:05.015]  No, I'm just freaking out.
[01:15:05.075 --> 01:15:07.957]  I mean, I agree with you and probably swallow us in the process.
[01:15:07.977 --> 01:15:08.517]  What do we do?
[01:15:08.597 --> 01:15:09.758]  No, no, no.
[01:15:10.078 --> 01:15:13.140]  The little people at the bottom are always the ones that survive.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:14.961]  The meek shall inherit the earth.
[01:15:15.501 --> 01:15:15.762]  Yeah.
[01:15:18.883 --> 01:15:21.985]  The little people at the bottom are always the ones that survive.
[01:15:22.025 --> 01:15:22.906]  There's too many of us.
[01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:23.813]  I'm
[01:15:44.395 --> 01:15:47.938]  Are saying, oh we've got, George W. has got to be impeached.
[01:15:48.358 --> 01:15:51.500]  I don't understand though, he is just a puppet in the front, but I agree.
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:59.566]  Both political parties have been discredited, evidenced by the Gallup polls coming out, 9% approval ratings for Congress, the lowest in history by many points.
[01:16:00.166 --> 01:16:13.056]  What's going to happen to all the, as the economy implodes and there's millions more cops, revenuers, bureaucracies, what are they going to do as it comes out their bosses are terrorists, as the whole government is discredited, what are all they going to do?
[01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:20.707]  We'll have to wait and see what they're going to do, but they're going to be in a very uncomfortable position.
[01:16:22.128 --> 01:16:24.349]  They're going to be in trouble up to their eyeballs.
[01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:28.330]  But I mean, there's going to be no more money to squeeze out of little old ladies on the side of the road.
[01:16:28.771 --> 01:16:29.011]  Right.
[01:16:29.071 --> 01:16:31.092]  No more people to SWAT team and kill for fun.
[01:16:31.112 --> 01:16:33.433]  I mean, I guess the whole party's over for them, huh?
[01:16:34.253 --> 01:16:35.514]  The party's going to be over.
[01:16:35.954 --> 01:16:36.914]  No question about it.
[01:16:39.215 --> 01:16:40.436]  That's why I'm an optimist.
[01:16:41.505 --> 01:16:44.346]  I don't know, what if they set off a nuke and then prance around as saviors?
[01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:45.126]  They could do anything.
[01:16:46.006 --> 01:16:54.368]  Well, there could be a lot of people that get hurt real bad, but there'll be lots of little people that'll still be around.
[01:16:54.488 --> 01:17:05.290]  No, but I mean, the globalists will kill a million of us in the blink of an eye, and I see these bastards setting off a couple of A-bombs so they can prance around in their fancy suits and be loved by the idiot population.
[01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.751]  I just hope the people out there stop being idiots, folks.
[01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:08.471]  This isn't a game.
[01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:15.952]  It could happen, but they're going to pay.
[01:17:15.992 --> 01:17:18.073]  They're going to get caught.
[01:17:18.273 --> 01:17:26.356]  They're going to get trapped in their own filth and their own sin, their own scheming and such.
[01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.216]  They're going to trap themselves.
[01:17:29.817 --> 01:17:30.277]  Oh, God.
[01:17:31.157 --> 01:17:32.078]  Let's take some calls.
[01:17:32.138 --> 01:17:33.858]  Jeff in Detroit, you're on the air with Red Beckman.
[01:17:35.479 --> 01:17:36.159]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:36.399 --> 01:17:39.140]  Alex Red, it's an honor to be on the radio with you guys.
[01:17:40.351 --> 01:17:42.793]  Um, I just got two questions for you, Red.
[01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:47.956]  Um, where's the... Are you guys there?
[01:17:48.916 --> 01:17:49.156]  What?
[01:17:50.717 --> 01:17:52.038]  Caller, we're here, brother.
[01:17:52.058 --> 01:17:53.899]  We're talking to you on air right now.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:55.600]  Okay, great.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.341]  That's all I can do is just go to you.
[01:17:58.862 --> 01:18:00.363]  Where's the legal authority?
[01:18:01.102 --> 01:18:07.370]  As it pertains to local ordinances and especially permits.
[01:18:09.493 --> 01:18:17.343]  Those are all fabricated by public servants and they're not Congress, they're not state legislatures and all that.
[01:18:17.463 --> 01:18:19.826]  And of course our state legislatures and our Congress
[01:18:21.762 --> 01:18:32.388]  Their credibility rating is... well, they tell me that the credibility rating of our Congress in Washington is even lower than the credibility for George W. No, it is.
[01:18:32.448 --> 01:18:32.548]  It's 9%.
[01:18:32.868 --> 01:18:34.089]  W is like 19.
[01:18:34.489 --> 01:18:35.309]  Cheney's at 9.
[01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:37.871]  Okay, Jeff, good to hear from you.
[01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:39.612]  We're going to Maria in Deutschland.
[01:18:39.812 --> 01:18:41.193]  Maria, you're on the air from Germany.
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:42.681]  Yeah, hi, yeah.
[01:18:42.981 --> 01:18:45.043]  It's all about beating up the Aryan race.
[01:18:45.063 --> 01:18:47.005]  You know, Hitler started it in Germany.
[01:18:47.065 --> 01:18:48.646]  He was Aryan race.
[01:18:48.686 --> 01:18:50.508]  He never was for the Germans.
[01:18:51.028 --> 01:18:53.130]  He killed millions of Germans, you know?
[01:18:53.671 --> 01:18:59.476]  And then, and then he was supposed to be, argue, people are so bad, the humans can do all so much bad.
[01:18:59.576 --> 01:18:59.917]  Nah!
[01:19:00.257 --> 01:19:05.662]  The Germans were busy fighting the wars, all the fucking wars that Hitler put him in, you know what I mean?
[01:19:06.202 --> 01:19:07.704]  My dad was fighting the war.
[01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:12.988]  Then he came back from the war, then he was in a prison camp, then more people got killed, you know?
[01:19:13.008 --> 01:19:22.616]  Then, people are, you know, the best, the best knowledge for people is really do not do what a Nazi tells you to do, because he is against you.
[01:19:22.996 --> 01:19:25.839]  Just like Bush said, are you with us or against us?
[01:19:25.919 --> 01:19:28.221]  No, he is against us, yeah?
[01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:35.787]  So somebody told my dad, yeah, you have to wait in queue and get on that thing and this is gonna go, get you to that camp.
[01:19:36.431 --> 01:19:39.532]  And my dad and the maid of his, you know, they were in prison camp.
[01:19:39.873 --> 01:19:46.416]  They cut themselves one after another, and my dad said, let's not be too quick on this, you know, there's something dodgy, yeah?
[01:19:46.796 --> 01:19:59.101]  And they sneaked off, and they found a rabbit at night somewhere, and they found a family where they could crash overnight, and later, years later, he found out everybody on that where they were supposed to go on, you know?
[01:19:59.402 --> 01:20:00.702]  And my dad is German, yeah?
[01:20:01.743 --> 01:20:02.303]  Everybody.
[01:20:02.817 --> 01:20:08.301]  on that thing, got killed in the next prison camp, and that was by the other Aryan race.
[01:20:08.662 --> 01:20:10.703]  So I want to tell you about the Aryan race.
[01:20:10.763 --> 01:20:20.911]  I've got a website at www.bilderberg.de.tt.
[01:20:21.091 --> 01:20:21.971]  Okay, we'll check it out.
[01:20:22.031 --> 01:20:23.292]  Thank you for the call from Germany.
[01:20:24.293 --> 01:20:26.475]  Denise in Arkansas, you're on the air with Red Beckman.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:31.343]  Hey, I really appreciate the information and the opportunity to prepare.
[01:20:31.543 --> 01:20:34.305]  I'm a wife and a mom, and I'm trying to prepare for my family.
[01:20:34.345 --> 01:20:36.367]  My husband is not awake.
[01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:43.352]  He gets angry when I try to talk to him about this and try to wake him up, so I have to feed him, you know, just little bits and pieces.
[01:20:43.473 --> 01:20:47.816]  But my question is about the imminent collapse of the dollar, and I'm really worried.
[01:20:48.456 --> 01:20:52.400]  My husband's at an age where he can cash out his 401K, but he'll have to pay a penalty.
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:56.723]  Is it in our best interest to cash that out and pay off our house?
[01:20:57.464 --> 01:20:59.145]  At least we don't lose the value of that.
[01:20:59.185 --> 01:21:00.346]  We have our house paid off.
[01:21:00.826 --> 01:21:04.228]  And I also had a question about the red, blue, yellow list.
[01:21:05.268 --> 01:21:10.191]  Where they're pulling people over, you know, for no reason, and trying to get their info, trying to take their name.
[01:21:10.271 --> 01:21:11.732]  Is that the purpose?
[01:21:12.693 --> 01:21:13.373]  Yes, yes.
[01:21:13.433 --> 01:21:17.655]  It's all part of training you to be pulled over, to be questioned, to be interrogated.
[01:21:17.715 --> 01:21:20.757]  It's all come out, and it's now happening.
[01:21:20.877 --> 01:21:21.798]  As for list,
[01:21:22.598 --> 01:21:27.341]  It's declassified that they do have a list of people they plan to kill immediately like me and Red Beckman.
[01:21:27.881 --> 01:21:31.043]  Red Beckman and I and many others they plan to take for re-education.
[01:21:31.063 --> 01:21:31.843]  This isn't a joke.
[01:21:31.883 --> 01:21:37.246]  It's now not Red Beckman telling you this 35 years ago because he had military contacts.
[01:21:37.306 --> 01:21:39.627]  It is now in the newspaper telling you it's good.
[01:21:40.287 --> 01:21:41.428]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:21:41.448 --> 01:21:45.130]  Let's get Red's take on what... I'm not giving financial advice.
[01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:50.052]  We're covering what's happening and then it's up to you to make your own personal decisions.
[01:21:50.452 --> 01:21:51.053]  But Red,
[01:21:52.543 --> 01:22:04.272]  Well, it's not a time to think about how you can invest a dollar, you know, to save your fortune.
[01:22:05.653 --> 01:22:20.224]  Basically, you want to think about saving your life and the life of your friends and your family, and wait until this thing goes through, this storm goes through, and hope that you can survive.
[01:22:21.829 --> 01:22:24.758]  But, you know, protecting your wealth is...
[01:22:27.564 --> 01:22:29.125]  That's not going to do it, I don't think.
[01:22:29.505 --> 01:22:30.245]  Well, I know this.
[01:22:30.345 --> 01:22:39.089]  I mean, I've got four acres out in the middle of the country that I just happened to get from a side issue, not even by design.
[01:22:39.109 --> 01:22:52.934]  I'm trying to look at some property, you know, where I can run out with an RV and I've got a lot of food and guns if I have to, or we've got family property three hours away, but I don't even know if I can make it out there or if the people in that area seem so brainwashed.
[01:22:52.954 --> 01:22:55.675]  My God, they probably think freedom's evil and might hang me for it.
[01:22:56.255 --> 01:23:01.599]  So, you know, it's not just the area, it's not just having a place to run to, it's who's in that area.
[01:23:02.419 --> 01:23:07.622]  I mean, it's just everything's going to hell in a hand basket and it's all this blind worship of government that's done it.
[01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.084]  Red Beckman, I want to have you back up in the near future.
[01:23:10.124 --> 01:23:12.986]  I knew back in 2003 when I tried to get you on, you were in the hospital.
[01:23:13.386 --> 01:23:14.747]  We prayed for you here on air.
[01:23:15.167 --> 01:23:16.248]  I'm glad you're doing better.
[01:23:16.728 --> 01:23:18.629]  Fire out your address one more time for people.
[01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:23.312]  My address is just Red Beckman at P.O.
[01:23:23.352 --> 01:23:23.632]  Box 61.
[01:23:25.515 --> 01:23:32.060]  Carol's Washington, that's C-A-R-R-O-L-L-S, and the zip is 98609.
[01:23:35.383 --> 01:23:46.772]  I'm out in Washington rather than in Montana because I have family here that wanted me where they could keep an eye on me and take care of my missus if something happens to me.
[01:23:47.412 --> 01:23:52.917]  So I still love Montana and I'd prefer to be there, but I'm not there right now.
[01:23:53.658 --> 01:23:57.704]  But if they kill me, Alex, it's a promotion.
[01:24:08.346 --> 01:24:10.546]  And good Lord, be good to you, too.
[01:24:11.227 --> 01:24:11.567]  Thank you.
[01:24:11.587 --> 01:24:11.947]  Keep talking.
[01:24:12.087 --> 01:24:12.667]  Thank you, Red.
[01:24:13.107 --> 01:24:14.767]  Yeah, I'm not even worried about them killing me.
[01:24:14.827 --> 01:24:17.408]  I'm worried about all the innocent people that have no idea what's going on.
[01:24:17.488 --> 01:24:18.408]  I just can't believe it.
[01:24:18.968 --> 01:24:29.650]  Dying Corp, Halliburton run, child kidnapping, rings or poisoning trips, chemical, biological testing, shooting everybody up with deadly vaccines, knowing it, giggling, moron, yuppies, walking around smirking about everything.
[01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:35.211]  John, I know I wanted to play that Chemtrail clip, but we now have the Cy Hirsch audio clip
[01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:49.764]  We just sent to you, it's up on JonesReport.com right now, folks, that Cheney wanted to provoke war by dressing up Navy SEALs as Iranians, putting them in patrol boats and having a staged firefight, having the Navy SEALs shoot at our ships.
[01:24:50.504 --> 01:24:51.805]  It's a long clip.
[01:24:52.386 --> 01:24:53.107]  Do you have it, John?
[01:24:53.647 --> 01:24:54.768]  It's loading up right now.
[01:24:54.868 --> 01:24:58.410]  Let's just start now with the chemtrail clip, and we'll come in in the next segment with it.
[01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:04.693]  Here's a newscast about how there's spraying stuff to control the weather, and then what they mention, they're spraying is, by the way, poisonous.
[01:25:04.713 --> 01:25:07.435]  So, go look it up for yourself in the chemical ingredients.
[01:25:07.475 --> 01:25:07.895]  Here it is.
[01:25:08.595 --> 01:25:14.238]  Mother Nature, weather modification is a growing trend both here in Northern California and around the world.
[01:25:14.578 --> 01:25:15.359]  So, does it work?
[01:25:15.859 --> 01:25:18.521]  And why do some people say it could do more harm than good?
[01:25:19.061 --> 01:25:22.923]  KTVU Health and Science Editor, John Fowler, has tonight's special report.
[01:25:24.767 --> 01:25:26.729]  California sure could use more rain.
[01:25:27.069 --> 01:25:29.972]  Tinder dry forests are burning at a record pace.
[01:25:31.433 --> 01:25:36.337]  Drought proclamations have millions of Bay Area water users cutting back or paying more.
[01:25:36.938 --> 01:25:41.241]  And climate experts predict we're in for decades of unpredictable supply.
[01:25:41.822 --> 01:25:45.625]  The state's top water forecaster says we're on the edge right now.
[01:25:46.205 --> 01:25:48.728]  If next winter is wet, everything will be fine.
[01:25:48.748 --> 01:25:51.290]  If it's dry, we will be in a real drought.
[01:25:54.210 --> 01:25:56.072]  So what about making rain?
[01:25:56.572 --> 01:26:05.801]  Burt Lancaster's character was based on a real-life Californian who claimed 500 rain-making successes, including a San Diego flood.
[01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:19.533]  Charles Hatfield died a half-century ago without revealing his secret, but his successors are hard at work here in downtown San Francisco at PG&E headquarters up on the 16th floor, the weather office.
[01:26:20.225 --> 01:26:24.788]  Where the utility's top weatherman, Byron Marler, studies charts and satellite pictures.
[01:26:25.288 --> 01:26:27.610]  Marler's job is to change weather.
[01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:29.671]  Although he won't say it that way.
[01:26:29.952 --> 01:26:37.557]  We're really not changing the overall picture of the weather in the Sierra Nevada, with the exception of causing a little more snowfall over some of the watersheds.
[01:26:38.017 --> 01:26:40.299]  Five to ten percent additional water.
[01:26:40.319 --> 01:26:43.861]  And then later in the newscast, they admit they're spraying all over the country.
[01:26:44.842 --> 01:26:47.083]  And this is a cover for larger programs.
[01:26:48.004 --> 01:26:48.744]  We're going to come back.
[01:26:48.764 --> 01:26:49.225]  Stay with us.
[01:26:58.081 --> 01:26:59.742]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:03.484]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:27:03.644 --> 01:27:05.525]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:27:06.106 --> 01:27:08.827]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:27:09.147 --> 01:27:14.631]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:27:14.891 --> 01:27:18.793]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:27:19.113 --> 01:27:24.034]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:27:24.314 --> 01:27:27.095]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[01:27:27.355 --> 01:27:34.196]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[01:27:34.576 --> 01:27:40.397]  Thousands of special video reports, from tainted vaccines to martial law, can be found in this online video library.
[01:27:40.557 --> 01:27:45.078]  My weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[01:27:45.518 --> 01:27:45.819]  In a minute!
[01:27:45.939 --> 01:27:46.199]  Alright, Jones.
[01:28:16.266 --> 01:28:20.707]  As we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[01:28:21.628 --> 01:28:26.269]  With Drink and Mate, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[01:28:26.609 --> 01:28:37.792]  Drink and Mate's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach, and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:41.874]  Just dissolve one Drink and Mate in water and take it before bed.
[01:28:42.154 --> 01:28:42.794]  It's that easy.
[01:28:43.634 --> 01:28:45.935]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities.
[01:28:47.552 --> 01:28:51.013]  Drink and Mate Hangover Defense is available at retailers nationwide.
[01:28:51.373 --> 01:28:52.214]  Pick up some today!
[01:28:53.034 --> 01:28:55.915]  Remember your drink and mate, and wake up feeling great!
[01:28:57.175 --> 01:29:03.017]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:04.838]  But there is something you can do.
[01:29:05.258 --> 01:29:15.101]  Fuel Saver Incorporated's fuel enhancer formula will not only stretch each gallon of fuel further for mere pennies per treated gallon, but also cleans fuel injectors, pumps, and reduces emissions.

[01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:36.189]  This album Think Progress just now posted on JonesReport.com and of course Infowars.com.
[01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:37.550]  There's video there.
[01:30:37.570 --> 01:30:40.793]  I'm going to play some audio of it in just a moment, but go to JonesReport.com.
[01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:42.114]  It's right there on the top of the page.
[01:30:42.155 --> 01:30:42.715]  Easy to find.
[01:30:44.016 --> 01:30:45.397]  Exclusive to Provoke War.
[01:30:46.676 --> 01:30:50.640]  Cheney considered a proposal to dress up Navy SEALs as Iranians and shoot at them.
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:56.246]  He told the press this privately and on the stage at a Campus Progress journalism conference.
[01:30:56.286 --> 01:31:02.954]  But Sy Hirsch said they decided not to run with it because the plan wasn't green-lighted by the Pentagon.
[01:31:02.974 --> 01:31:08.299]  See, that's why Admiral Fallon and others have been coming out warning about false flag and Ray McGovern.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.461]  Even Gary Hart saying the U.S.
[01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:11.622]  may stage terror attacks.
[01:31:11.963 --> 01:31:16.807]  They do it all the time, but they need the main military to be part of it, so they said no.
[01:31:17.467 --> 01:31:20.750]  Now when they use foreign client states and others, they did carry out their 9-11.
[01:31:21.931 --> 01:31:28.436]  Navy SEALs in patrol boats pulling up on video shooting at the destroyers and missile frigates.
[01:31:29.497 --> 01:31:30.058]  Unbelievable!
[01:31:30.078 --> 01:31:34.842]  To provoke war, Cheney considered proposal to dress up Navy SEALs as Iranians
[01:31:36.204 --> 01:31:44.112]  And to have them shoot back and forth at each other for the news cameras and for the cattle that just want to be raped and go into World War III and have $10 a gallon gas.
[01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.113]  Here's the audio, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:47.114 --> 01:31:56.263]  Anyway, there was a meeting among the items considered and rejected, which is why the New Yorker did not publish it on grounds that it wasn't accepted.
[01:31:57.361 --> 01:32:02.964]  One of the items was, why not, there was a dozen ideas, Proffert, how to trigger a war.
[01:32:03.004 --> 01:32:18.573]  The one that interested me the most was, why don't we build, we in our shipyard, build four or five irate boats that look like Iranian PT boats, put navy seals on them, with a lot of arms, and the next time one of our boats goes through the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up.
[01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:20.334]  Might cost some lives.
[01:32:21.014 --> 01:32:23.716]  And it was ejected because you can't have Americans killing Americans.
[01:32:23.896 --> 01:32:24.756]  That's the level of stuff.
[01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:28.595]  We were talking about provocation.
[01:32:29.275 --> 01:32:30.175]  But that was rejected.
[01:32:30.955 --> 01:32:35.837]  So I can understand the argument of not writing something that was rejected.
[01:32:36.277 --> 01:32:36.917]  Okay.
[01:32:37.077 --> 01:32:40.758]  No, they put that out to the brass to see if they'll be part of the evil.
[01:32:41.398 --> 01:32:49.781]  Operation Northwoods to stage terror attacks like 9-11, dress up US troops like foreign troops, attack our bases, shoot Americans in Miami.
[01:32:49.841 --> 01:32:50.521]  It's all there.
[01:32:50.841 --> 01:32:52.842]  That was green-lined and carried out.
[01:32:53.622 --> 01:33:07.854]  In the Gulf of Tonkin and of course then at the USS Liberty now declassified all you that said it wouldn't be now admitted Israel attacked the ship working with the White House to try to sink it Chicago Tribune admitting they knew it was an American ship it was a staged event
[01:33:09.435 --> 01:33:10.536]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[01:33:10.576 --> 01:33:13.117]  We'll have more detailed articles adding in the other info.
[01:33:13.397 --> 01:33:15.758]  I think this is outrageous that the New Yorker didn't publish this.
[01:33:16.479 --> 01:33:18.460]  This shows the mindset and what they're doing.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:21.842]  Folks, if we don't get the word out, they're going to continue staging more terror attacks.
[01:33:22.162 --> 01:33:22.642]  Period.
[01:33:22.922 --> 01:33:26.684]  Now is the time to have a revelation of understanding of who the real terrorists are.
[01:33:29.226 --> 01:33:36.570]  In closing here at the end of the show, what makes this broadcast possible is supporting our sponsors that you see on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:37.705 --> 01:33:46.807]  And that you hear about on this radio show and by buying the books and videos and materials that we carry and that I produced that are in the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:46.827 --> 01:33:47.468]  So don't wait.

[01:33:48.928 --> 01:33:49.868]  Get Truth Rising.
[01:33:50.168 --> 01:33:51.469]  Expose the government terror.
[01:33:51.769 --> 01:33:52.849]  Our future depends on it.
[01:33:52.869 --> 01:33:55.009]  They're going to keep staging attacks and take all your freedoms, folks.
[01:33:55.190 --> 01:33:56.030]  They built death camps.
[01:33:56.050 --> 01:33:58.030]  The only help you've got is to expose they're behind it.
[01:33:58.510 --> 01:34:00.151]  Okoloblue.com.
[01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:02.732]  It's a great atmospheric water generator.

[01:34:11.017 --> 01:34:12.278]  Atmospheric water generator.
