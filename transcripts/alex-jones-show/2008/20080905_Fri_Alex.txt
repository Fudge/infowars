[00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.753]  And then I'm throwing so many points backing him up.
[00:00:04.773 --> 00:00:06.194]  I mean, there's so many examples of this.
[00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:11.057]  Foster children having pesticides and drugs tested on them until they die.
[00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:14.000]  Thousands of children being radiated to death in the U.S.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.560]  and Israel.
[00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.842]  I mean, this is so massive.
[00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.323]  This is going on everywhere.
[00:00:18.343 --> 00:00:24.248]  And there are so many examples of the eugenics being carried out against free humanity that it boggles the mind.
[00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:26.109]  But let's go back to the root of this.
[00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.511]  Aaron, read a few more quotes before we go back to Dr. Monteith.
[00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:35.130]  I'll let the listeners discern the difference between the intellectual theory and what's actually going on in the world.
[00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:45.383]  But here is Bertrand Russell, The Impact of Science on Society, 1953, Complete Examination of the Eugenical Scientific Dictatorship.
[00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:51.426]  Quote, I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing.
[00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:59.010]  War has hitherto been disappointing in this respect, but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective.
[00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.354]  If a black death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation, survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.
[00:01:07.854 --> 00:01:11.135]  The state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant, but what of that?
[00:01:11.535 --> 00:01:15.796]  Really high-minded people are indifferent to happiness, especially other people's.
[00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:21.017]  There are three ways of securing a society that should be stable as regards the population.
[00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:22.377]  The first is birth control.
[00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:25.758]  Second, infanticide or really destructive wars.
[00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:29.879]  And the third, that of general misery, except for a powerful minority.
[00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:43.678]  Now Aaron, earlier before Dr. Monteith joined us, you read all the official Defense Department and PNAG documents where they said we want to use race-specific bioweapons to target certain races and we need to legitimize this in the media.
[00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:47.081]  Dr. Monteith, finish up with, you were talking about AIDS being a U.S.
[00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.722]  government program, go through some of that evidence.
[00:01:49.783 --> 00:02:00.713]  Go through some of the evidence we were talking about with the tetanus shots, the female hormone added to sterilize them, and then let's get into these race-specific bioweapons.
[00:02:01.013 --> 00:02:02.615]  Dr. Monteith, who is a medical doctor.
[00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:25.435]  Well, first of all, what they did with the Texas vaccine that they gave to women, and we know specifically in Kenya and the Philippines, but probably many other third world countries, they put in a chorionidotrophin, which is a hormone which is necessary a woman secretes when she, of course, becomes pregnant, and it protects the fetus from abortion.
[00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:33.017]  Unfortunately, by putting this through a vaccine, the woman became sensitive to it, and of course, when she began to actually
[00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:38.041]  Got pregnant, and the fetus began to produce a choroid gonadotropin.
[00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:44.646]  The woman's immune system would destroy that, and so that women could not conceive and become pregnant.
[00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:59.558]  This was done as part of a worldwide program, but they can't let the people in the third world countries, or certainly the people in the United States, understand this is what our tax money is being used for, as far as the manufacturing of the AIDS epidemic is concerned.
[00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.395]  There's a wonderful book called Full Disclosure.
[00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:05.617]  Full Disclosure, and you can get it on the internet, it's out of print.
[00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:14.723]  But of course there, the author has actually talked to a man who was there when they were actually producing, creating the AIDS virus, the HIV virus.
[00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:28.391]  Certainly my good friend Dr. Gareth Nicholson, who's one of the world's leading scientists, has written a book, which we do carry, called Project A. Lilly, and he talks there about how they actually engineered the
[00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:29.321]  It's
[00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:00.761]  Absolutely.
[00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:11.664]  I mean, HIV, if you look at the statistics here in the United States, almost, not quite, but almost half of the people with HIV and AIDS who have died have been black.
[00:04:12.124 --> 00:04:16.785]  And of course, the statistics show it has a present predisposition to the black and the Hispanic.
[00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:20.466]  But paid-off black leaders won't talk about it.
[00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:21.887]  But Hispanic leaders won't.
[00:04:22.207 --> 00:04:31.075]  They'll just have fake race politics, or did somebody call them the N-word, which you go back to Margaret Sanger in the Colgate letters to the foundation, in the Rockefeller Foundation papers.
[00:04:31.095 --> 00:04:31.716]  These are public.
[00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:38.041]  We actually sent off for them at the different universities, saying, we can't let the blacks know we want to exterminate them.
[00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.103]  We've got to hire liberal front blacks.
[00:04:40.143 --> 00:04:44.467]  In fact, Aaron has the quotes, but you were trying to explain the numbers.
[00:04:44.947 --> 00:04:48.432]  Well basically, they know how to create diseases for specific races, and there's one specific gene
[00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:02.144]  And we don't have it.
[00:05:02.244 --> 00:05:05.585]  We white people don't have it, or maybe we only have one of the two.
[00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:09.426]  We don't have the proper couplers for the virus to plug into.
[00:05:09.906 --> 00:05:17.789]  And this is the coupler that is used to attach the HIV virus to the cells that are going to be attacked.
[00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:21.610]  So the blacks usually will have both of those genes.
[00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.011]  Most whites will have either one or none of them.
[00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:29.593]  And if you don't have any of the genes, you're not going to get HIV no matter how promiscuous you are.
[00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:31.930]  If you have one of them, you may get it.
[00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:41.038]  And this is why, certainly, almost half of the people here in the United States who either have HIV or have died are black.
[00:05:41.078 --> 00:05:42.399]  This is a race-specific disease.
[00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:49.284]  If any of your listeners would like to know more about it, I wrote an article published by the American Journal of Physicians and Surgeons.
[00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:52.046]  It was called, AIDS, The Unknown Story.
[00:05:52.106 --> 00:05:54.028]  And I'd be glad to provide those free of charge.
[00:05:54.048 --> 00:05:55.289]  Could I put on my 800 number?
[00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:56.089]  Absolutely!
[00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:57.871]  Put that out and also give people your website.
[00:05:58.799 --> 00:05:58.879]  800-544-8927.
[00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:59.420]  800-544-8927.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:12.370]  We'll send you free of charge a copy of the article we wrote that goes into the background of the very specificity of HIV disease.
[00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.330]  They knew what they were doing.
[00:06:13.771 --> 00:06:16.333]  Our website, RadioLiberty.com.
[00:06:16.353 --> 00:06:23.478]  But you can read the things, certainly on the PNAC website, of the Project for the New American Century, something they wrote entitled
[00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:24.256]  I don't know.
[00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:47.697]  Now, let's go back, and then I want to read some Margaret Sanger quotes here.
[00:06:47.758 --> 00:06:48.278]  Let's go back.
[00:06:48.318 --> 00:06:53.902]  What was it like for you as a very successful medical doctor, surgeon?
[00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:57.905]  What was it like for you as you began your awakening?
[00:06:58.205 --> 00:07:07.492]  I mean, how did you awaken to this and become one of the most prominent, respected people exposing race-specific bio-warfare that we're now more than three decades into?
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.882]  Well, basically, it isn't very good for your practice, but we are always able to survive.
[00:07:13.923 --> 00:07:16.844]  There are always doctors out there who would refer to me.
[00:07:16.904 --> 00:07:23.467]  I was a specialist in orthopedic surgery, and there were doctors who maybe wouldn't take a stand themselves, but they'd back me.
[00:07:23.507 --> 00:07:24.808]  So I was able to survive.
[00:07:24.828 --> 00:07:28.510]  But there is so much to this story.
[00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.171]  We've written a book called AIDS, The Unnecessary Epidemic.
[00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:39.910]  Totally blacked out by the media every time we go to get it listed, you know, in the national list of books in print by somebody who came along to take it out.
[00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.092]  But we were able to get, I think, 20, almost 30,000 copies of that book out across America.
[00:07:45.572 --> 00:07:59.738]  People have to understand the last thing that the wicked people want is for the people, American people, to wake up and understand the genocidal programs underway that have targeted them and their children, but specifically the blacks and Hispanics.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:14.288]  Continue though, why does the New World Order, Dr. Monteith, why does the New World Order want to kill so many people?
[00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:18.971]  I mean, we know it has a religious base, it also has this eugenic, scientific rationale.
[00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:20.152]  Why do they want this?
[00:08:20.973 --> 00:08:25.796]  Basically because they are carrying out the prophecies of the Book of Revelation.
[00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:34.172]  I mean, you read Revelation 6, 8, they tell you they're going to kill a quarter of the population, and then of course you go on and they're going to kill billions more.
[00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:38.034]  People have to really understand, these people are deadly serious.
[00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:40.455]  They are trying to bring to pass
[00:08:41.033 --> 00:08:46.557]  of the horror that is described in the revelation, because they think that is going to bring their leader to power.
[00:09:02.489 --> 00:09:11.174]  Well, unfortunately, you know, a lot of people, patriotic people, get into Special Forces and do not realize that once they get in, they're going to be indoctrinated into the occult, and there are strong occult forces within the American Special Forces.
[00:09:32.304 --> 00:09:35.848]  Just as there were within the SS over in Hitler's Germany.
[00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:38.031]  The SS was the cult organization.
[00:09:38.531 --> 00:09:44.038]  And even though many people join the military and get into these specialized organizations,
[00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:48.518]  They are certainly indoctrinated in these occult concepts.
[00:09:48.938 --> 00:09:50.660]  I just hope that they're not accepting them.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:10:05.393]  I hope that we have enough people in the military who love America and realize their loyalty is to our country and our Constitution, not to the wicked people who seize control of our government and are using people like Barbara Mark Hubbard and other occult individuals.
[00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:08.316]  In fact, they even have divisions within our military.
[00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:10.678]  That are into remote viewing.
[00:10:10.718 --> 00:10:17.003]  They're into, you know, trying to get up... Well, I've actually had Major General Stubblebine, who now is anti-New World Order.
[00:10:17.023 --> 00:10:18.885]  He said he never saw the Master Plan.
[00:10:19.105 --> 00:10:21.067]  He was also the head of Army Intelligence before that.
[00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.790]  And he said, yeah, they were into the occult.
[00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.192]  They were commanded to go in and do this.
[00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:29.054]  They're now making a major movie with George Clooney about it.
[00:10:29.935 --> 00:10:35.558]  I'm sure this is absolutely true, and I will tell you, if you analyze the ability to actually remote view, to actually have these supernatural experiences,
[00:10:57.677 --> 00:11:12.527]  To be able to have your body taken over and somebody else speak to it, it would be totally intriguing for somebody unless they understood that we are told in the Bible specifically to avoid the mediums and the fortune tellers, and certainly the people who are into spiritualism and the supernatural.
[00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:13.848]  I mean, it's intriguing.
[00:11:13.868 --> 00:11:17.451]  An awful lot of people get into it without ever realizing, of course, the power.
[00:11:17.964 --> 00:11:28.453]  And notice, they'll always put flowery terms in love and peace is coming, and this wonderful utopia is coming, but first we've got to kill billions.
[00:11:40.692 --> 00:11:42.733]  And then this world utopia will come.
[00:11:43.113 --> 00:11:44.234]  And of course they were lied to.
[00:11:44.254 --> 00:11:49.616]  But communism is only a transitional step towards what we're really up against now.
[00:11:50.336 --> 00:11:59.620]  We are up against powerful spiritual forces that are working through a number of organizations trying to destroy our belief in God and family and country.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:07.203]  And basically these are the people who have control of the reins of power in the United States and are using
[00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:30.154]  The military and financial power of the United States... Now, I want to be clear, Doctor, and I want you to talk about world government, but to be clear, we've got a lot of atheists and agnostics listening, even if you don't believe in spiritualism or God, the devil, dark and light, any of that, it is a scientific fact that the elite world system, the technological control grid,
[00:12:31.957 --> 00:12:36.778]  The technological, you know, worldwide enslavement system is New World Order controlled.
[00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:38.579]  They are into the occult.
[00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:42.420]  Their goal is to get world government so they can kill the majority of us.
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.901]  That is in official State Department documents, official British documents.
[00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:47.741]  It's in all their publications.
[00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:49.502]  God help us, folks!
[00:12:50.282 --> 00:12:53.284]  They are spraying poison in the skies, the water, the food.
[00:12:53.645 --> 00:12:55.486]  It's all coming out now.
[00:12:55.946 --> 00:12:59.209]  And I wanted Aaron to read some more eugenics quotes, and then we'll go back to Dr. Monteef.
[00:12:59.269 --> 00:13:00.229]  Read some more of those, Aaron.
[00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.533]  Yeah, I guess I'll go over some Margaret Singer quotes here, a lot of which I read yesterday.
[00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:10.677]  No woman shall have the legal right to bear a child without a permit for parenthood.
[00:13:11.238 --> 00:13:14.300]  This was part of the American Baby Code she tried to have pass as law.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:20.709]  And now that's being proposed, China did it, now it's being sold here, that you'll get tax breaks if you don't have more than one child.
[00:13:20.789 --> 00:13:22.191]  Yeah, Nazi Germany did it too.
[00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:26.056]  But remember when, and the CPS taking kids, Nazi Germany, England, the U.S.
[00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:28.319]  social workers were founded for this.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.903]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers it.
[00:13:30.923 --> 00:13:31.284]  Continue.
[00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:34.402]  Well, yeah, people get into the debate because it's so contentious.
[00:13:34.462 --> 00:13:36.742]  Was Margaret Sanger a killer?
[00:13:36.782 --> 00:13:37.802]  Was she racist?
[00:13:37.842 --> 00:13:39.162]  Did she want to kill all these people?
[00:13:39.743 --> 00:13:41.463]  Well, you can see the racism in the system.
[00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:42.783]  She was Rockefeller-funded.
[00:13:43.183 --> 00:13:45.864]  So was German Nazi eugenics, Rockefeller-funded.
[00:13:46.664 --> 00:13:55.466]  I think you can see the racism in the whole system and the intent to kill, regardless of if this individual said that in her quotes or not, which she did, of course.
[00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:56.826]  She referred to people as weeds.
[00:13:57.586 --> 00:13:58.966]  And so they should be exterminated.
[00:13:58.986 --> 00:14:01.787]  Yeah, where's the quote about we can't let the blacks know we want to exterminate them?
[00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:04.728]  Well, it's kind of a tongue-in-cheek, but that's my point.
[00:14:04.748 --> 00:14:06.149]  You could see it in the larger system.
[00:14:06.469 --> 00:14:13.051]  We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social services backgrounds and with engaging personalities.
[00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:17.692]  The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal.
[00:14:18.152 --> 00:14:28.563]  We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and if the minister is the man who could straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.
[00:14:29.183 --> 00:14:33.247]  She wrote in 39 to Clarence Gamble of Procter & Gamble,
[00:14:34.386 --> 00:14:36.448]  And yeah, I mean that's basically it.
[00:14:36.468 --> 00:14:45.136]  There were a lot of black leaders who were sort of into the idea of, you know, making the race kind of better quality than over quality.
[00:14:45.156 --> 00:14:45.956]  No, no, they certainly are.
[00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:46.717]  They were on the payroll.
[00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:48.318]  Let's go back to Dr. Monti.
[00:14:48.358 --> 00:14:53.783]  Doctor, that's why the black leaders and Hispanic leaders, they'll let the Mexicans wave Mexican flags all day.
[00:14:53.823 --> 00:14:55.164]  You just take that shot, baby.
[00:14:55.885 --> 00:14:57.927]  You know, their Mexican leaders won't tell them that, will they, Doc?
[00:14:58.427 --> 00:14:59.388]  No, they certainly won't.
[00:15:00.929 --> 00:15:12.120]  There really are people who have this white supremacist attitude, and I have to be white, but certainly I believe every person is made in the image and likeness of God, whether they're black or yellow or red or white.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:22.830]  But the people who are involved in this really are followers of a woman named Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, and she really believed in the superiority of the Aryan race.
[00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:26.414]  And it was her writings, specifically in the Secret Doctrine.
[00:15:26.434 --> 00:15:29.156]  The Theosophic Society, Hitler followed her.
[00:15:29.876 --> 00:15:38.823]  Absolutely, in fact, that's why Hitler embraced these Aryan superiority concepts, because he was the disciple of Khalid ibn Khatib.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.164]  And simply, in every major city in America today, there's a metaphysical bookstore.
[00:15:45.284 --> 00:15:54.933]  And you'll always have the liberals, and then you'll confront them with Margaret Sanger, or you'll confront them with Blavatsky, and they'll kind of get your side and go, that's right, you son of a bitch, and we're going to get you soon.
[00:15:54.953 --> 00:16:02.759]  You know, they'll have this friendly little, oh, oh, nice, but behind the scenes it's, we've got to exterminate the blacks and the Mexicans!
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:11.203]  I mean, you know, it's like social services break up their families, get them in the inner cities, and the blacks are just dancing right into the gas chambers, basically.
[00:16:11.884 --> 00:16:17.126]  Well, you know, basically, of course, there's so many ways that the blacks are under attack today.
[00:16:18.026 --> 00:16:29.011]  Statistics show that if you're a young black man between the age of 21 and 31, one in every three is either on probation or parole or in prison.
[00:16:31.354 --> 00:16:33.775]  I mean, how could you possibly do something like that?
[00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:35.036]  Well, I'll tell you how they could do it.
[00:16:35.756 --> 00:16:37.216]  It is through water fluoridation.
[00:16:37.577 --> 00:16:42.099]  And there's a man back at Dartmouth named Roger Masters.
[00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:46.660]  He's into psychology, and why do people act the way they did?
[00:16:47.261 --> 00:16:49.462]  And actually, he's written a wonderful guest.
[00:16:49.522 --> 00:16:52.543]  If you can ever get him on, I'm sure he'd be a good guest for you.
[00:16:52.983 --> 00:16:59.866]  But basically, he found that, and there are studies which he quotes extensively, that in the areas where they
[00:17:00.447 --> 00:17:03.368]  Fluoridate the water, and they use hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:07.929]  That's used in 90 to 95% of the communities where they do water fluoridation.
[00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.931]  And of course, the hydrofluorosilicic acid contains lead, arsenic, polonium-220, and fluoride.
[00:17:14.872 --> 00:17:15.972]  It is a waste product.
[00:17:16.052 --> 00:17:17.232]  It's a deadly poison.
[00:17:17.713 --> 00:17:22.774]  Actually, they have to have specially aligned trucks to truck it into your community to fluoridate your water.
[00:17:22.794 --> 00:17:27.876]  But in the areas where they did that, and then they measured the level of lead.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:39.830]  Stay there, we're going to skip this break right now for the InfoWars.com streams and PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.971]  Everybody else will be right back.
[00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:47.748]  Now Doc, this is the big issue.
[00:17:48.228 --> 00:17:51.712]  It is a fact that the Germans and the Soviets put it in the water.
[00:17:51.752 --> 00:17:53.173]  It's in Pulitzer Prize winning books.
[00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:55.576]  They knew what it would do and that's the point.
[00:17:55.616 --> 00:18:01.782]  That's why the head dentist who got Canada fluoridated, as you know for 10 years has been apologizing, he thought it was
[00:18:02.423 --> 00:18:03.984]  Calcium fluoride they were putting in.
[00:18:04.364 --> 00:18:12.326]  No, it is this Grignard heavy metal by-product of aluminum and fertilizer purification, as you know.
[00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:18.008]  But for the audience, and they put it in the water with the heavy metals, so it's not just the fluoride, it's the lead.
[00:18:18.328 --> 00:18:20.329]  Please continue for the viewers out there.
[00:18:20.989 --> 00:18:21.329]  All right.
[00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:28.591]  Well, it's important that people understand that according to Roger Masters' department, when they've checked and they do this on 450
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.860]  They wanted to be sure what a good job they were doing.
[00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:37.642]  They did this on 450,000 children.
[00:18:38.122 --> 00:18:39.023]  They did finger sticks.
[00:18:39.063 --> 00:18:42.485]  They measured the level of lead in the blood.
[00:18:42.945 --> 00:18:48.848]  And if you were black, your level of lead in the blood went up six times.
[00:18:49.268 --> 00:18:50.488]  Hispanic, four times.
[00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:51.869]  White, it doubled.
[00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:53.810]  Now, why is that significant?
[00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:54.710]  Because lead causes a
[00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.351]  And by the way, they knew this in 1800, 1805.
[00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:05.316]  Napoleon, they would give less aggressive troops a tincture of lead, saying it got the blood up and made them more aggressive.
[00:19:05.336 --> 00:19:08.819]  So again, a lot of this has been known for hundreds of years.
[00:19:27.023 --> 00:19:31.145]  And they're doing this to the blacks in America today, and the fact that most people have never heard of this.
[00:19:31.785 --> 00:19:34.546]  We do have interviews, several interviews with Roger Masters.
[00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:35.787]  It's so vitally important.
[00:19:36.207 --> 00:19:44.411]  If you care about your black brothers and sisters and your Hispanic brothers and sisters, understand they're poisoning them with water, pardon me, with water fluoridation.
[00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:45.591]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:19:45.611 --> 00:19:46.452]  They've done studies.
[00:19:46.592 --> 00:19:50.914]  Magically, the cities are diverting stronger fluoridated areas to worse parts of town.
[00:19:51.234 --> 00:19:55.896]  I mean, folks, this is so diabolical, we just want to warn people.
[00:19:56.613 --> 00:20:02.655]  I think it's so important that the people in La Raza and Mecha and they have to understand that these organizations are funded by the Ford Foundation.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:31.928]  And that's how people get confused.
[00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:33.089]  That's how they get confused.
[00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:34.570]  I want to talk about that in the final segment.
[00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.893]  But, Doc, is there a time schedule when I get you for two hours here on the show?
[00:20:37.973 --> 00:20:39.313]  Oh, sure there is, but not today.
[00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:40.835]  I'm flying out in just a couple of hours.
[00:20:40.915 --> 00:20:41.855]  No, no, I understand that.
[00:20:41.875 --> 00:20:42.656]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:20:42.936 --> 00:20:44.477]  Next week would love to be with you.
[00:20:44.617 --> 00:20:46.097]  I'm going to have Trace back in Monday.
[00:20:46.117 --> 00:20:48.058]  I'm going to have him call you two hours next week.
[00:20:48.338 --> 00:20:49.438]  We've got five final minutes.
[00:20:49.478 --> 00:20:49.878]  Here we go.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:06.902]  For those that weren't listening on the Infowars.com streams on the MNFM dial, he went into how the blacks have five times the lead, Hispanics three to four times what whites do.
[00:21:07.362 --> 00:21:11.823]  They're pumping it directly into you through the sodium fluoride preparation.
[00:21:11.843 --> 00:21:13.443]  Now this is an absolute fact.
[00:21:15.406 --> 00:21:16.407]  You're under attack.
[00:21:16.488 --> 00:21:18.270]  Bayer puts the AIDS virus in your shots.
[00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.051]  It's mainstream news.
[00:21:20.392 --> 00:21:21.313]  People, all that's not true.
[00:21:21.333 --> 00:21:22.214]  You think I'd be on the air?
[00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:23.735]  You think they'd sue me if that wasn't true?
[00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:25.457]  You're under attack.
[00:21:25.577 --> 00:21:26.498]  I know it's scary.
[00:21:27.748 --> 00:21:31.571]  Folks, every night I have to deal with them, that they may kill me, they're threatening to kill me and my family.
[00:21:31.691 --> 00:21:36.615]  I still go on air because I have a responsibility, if I know this, to warn you.
[00:21:37.355 --> 00:21:40.738]  They fund your Mecha, your La Raza, your NAACP.
[00:21:41.138 --> 00:21:42.960]  That's how they control the Republicans.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.142]  All this stupid Republican-Democrat diversion.
[00:21:46.502 --> 00:21:50.325]  There is a worldwide eugenic state waging war against us all.
[00:21:50.706 --> 00:21:56.150]  Dr. Monteef, closing information about the New World Order, other attack patterns they're launching on us.
[00:21:57.318 --> 00:22:02.901]  Well, I fear very much that they're open for a nuclear war with the Muslim world.
[00:22:03.802 --> 00:22:10.126]  That gives them the civil admin story, the tenor files, and of course you can get that on the internet.
[00:22:10.966 --> 00:22:15.489]  Actually, Google in civil admins and the tenor files.
[00:22:15.819 --> 00:22:16.179]  I don't know.
[00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:31.480]  material they need to build nuclear weapons.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.283]  Now again, I wouldn't call it, you know, we have FBI agents saying it's like Al-Qaeda ran the FBI.
[00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:38.023]  It's not like that is it.
[00:22:38.384 --> 00:22:43.286]  You know, they call it rogue elements, but these are the real capstones of the pyramidal power structures.
[00:22:43.786 --> 00:22:49.729]  They're not allowed, of course, to investigate or reveal this, but the significance I think everybody's really missed.
[00:22:50.069 --> 00:22:55.452]  Why would we be funneling nuclear information to build nuclear weapons to the Pakistanis?
[00:22:56.015 --> 00:22:56.635]  That's very obvious.
[00:22:56.675 --> 00:22:58.516]  They want a nuclear war.
[00:22:58.856 --> 00:23:02.297]  And that'll really be a wonderful, wonderful way for population control.
[00:23:02.637 --> 00:23:07.038]  I hate to even consider this, but this is absolutely what they want.
[00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:09.919]  Why do you think the West snuck attack Russia three weeks ago?
[00:23:09.939 --> 00:23:13.220]  Well, this was the stupidest thing in the world.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.122]  Unless, of course, you want to draw Russia and China into a war with America, people say it can't happen.
[00:23:18.715 --> 00:23:19.816]  I think it's going to happen.
[00:23:19.836 --> 00:23:23.180]  I think if God is just, he's going to bring judgment on this nation.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.461]  We got some bold people.
[00:23:24.502 --> 00:23:27.905]  They'll fly remote control airplanes into the towers, folks.
[00:23:28.366 --> 00:23:29.447]  They're not playing games.
[00:23:29.707 --> 00:23:31.669]  That's one thing about these Luciferians, Doctor.
[00:23:31.709 --> 00:23:32.650]  They are bold, aren't they?
[00:23:33.362 --> 00:23:34.183]  They certainly are.
[00:23:34.743 --> 00:23:38.205]  And of course, they are succeeding because the good people are not taking a stand.
[00:23:38.825 --> 00:23:40.366]  And God is allowing this to happen.
[00:23:40.406 --> 00:23:42.187]  But one of these days, he's going to intervene.
[00:23:42.628 --> 00:23:45.409]  And I tremble for my country when I consider what's going to happen.
[00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.131]  Doc, let's look at your book right now, here live on air.
[00:23:49.112 --> 00:23:52.734]  I think I've got two big guests next week, so there's a low chance I'm going to move you.
[00:23:52.854 --> 00:23:53.835]  One day is blocked out.
[00:23:54.555 --> 00:23:56.136]  What day next week do you want to do two hours?
[00:23:56.176 --> 00:23:56.917]  I'm live at 11.
[00:23:57.457 --> 00:23:58.498]  I have the slightest idea.
[00:23:58.538 --> 00:23:59.818]  Just have Trey give me a call.
[00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:07.166]  I want to do a whole hour on eugenics and a whole thing on the civil admins and the nukes.
[00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:26.246]  Just please get Fabled Enemies, it gets into the things he was just talking about, Sybil Edmonds, the intelligence networks.
[00:24:26.826 --> 00:24:34.492]  At the top, foreign intelligence agencies, U.S., British, and Israeli, but they're sold out to the global system, sit at the highest levels.
[00:24:34.592 --> 00:24:38.335]  Continuity of government in this nation is run by multinationals.
[00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:38.935]  It's private.
[00:24:39.095 --> 00:24:41.077]  There's been a corporate takeover of our government.
[00:24:41.357 --> 00:24:44.760]  First they federalize, then they take over the federal government.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.542]  Through continuity of government systems.
[00:24:48.702 --> 00:24:51.785]  They do it in Brazil, they do it in England, they do it in Germany, they do it in the U.S.
[00:24:51.925 --> 00:24:56.810]  This is how they rule and Fabled Enemies covers all of that and how they carry out the attacks.
[00:24:57.964 --> 00:25:00.064]  You're like, what are you doing going toe-to-toe against these people?
[00:25:01.025 --> 00:25:02.545]  They're already spraying us and killing us.
[00:25:02.585 --> 00:25:05.425]  I mean, might as well, the last act of defiance here.
[00:25:05.885 --> 00:25:10.626]  My uncle has a t-shirt with a mouse with a hawk flying in to eat him and the mouse is going like that.
[00:25:11.727 --> 00:25:13.047]  The last act of defiance.
[00:25:13.647 --> 00:25:17.208]  I think we should have a debate about being exterminated and being soft-killed.
[00:25:17.648 --> 00:25:19.048]  I think we should have a discussion about it.
[00:25:19.408 --> 00:25:19.908]  And that's all.
[00:25:19.948 --> 00:25:21.328]  I'm just saying, well, they're killing us.
[00:25:21.888 --> 00:25:24.629]  I think you sheep should wake up and have a discussion about our fate.
[00:25:27.304 --> 00:25:29.366]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:27:01.494 --> 00:27:02.455]  This is the reality.
[00:27:02.795 --> 00:27:03.956]  This is what we're dealing with.
[00:27:04.637 --> 00:27:05.758]  We are being soft-killed.

[00:29:17.155 --> 00:29:19.437]  Okay, Aaron, you've got about 2-3 minutes left.
[00:29:19.737 --> 00:29:21.058]  I want to go back to Aaron now.
[00:29:21.438 --> 00:29:23.380]  Aaron, finish up with your other points on eugenics.
[00:29:23.752 --> 00:29:28.173]  Let's get a rapid-fire Margaret Singer quote and then finally a Richard Dawkins quote.
[00:29:28.293 --> 00:29:32.734]  Margaret Singer, the most merciful thing a family does to one of its infant members is to kill it.
[00:29:33.234 --> 00:29:36.075]  Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race.
[00:29:36.595 --> 00:29:38.856]  Eugenic sterilization is an urgent need.
[00:29:38.916 --> 00:29:42.036]  We must prevent multiplication of this bad stock.
[00:29:42.437 --> 00:29:48.118]  Eugenics is the most adequate and thorough avenue to solution of racial, political, and social problems.
[00:29:48.618 --> 00:29:53.682]  And Richard Dawkins has this kind of open thought of, uh, what if eugenics came back?
[00:29:54.143 --> 00:30:01.869]  In the 1920s and 1930s, scientists from both the political left and right would not have found the idea of designer babies particularly dangerous.
[00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.391]  Though, of course, they would not have used that phrase.
[00:30:04.491 --> 00:30:12.398]  Today, I suspect that the idea is too dangerous for comfortable discussion, and my conjecture is that Adolf Hitler is responsible for the change.
[00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:16.882]  Nobody wants to be caught agreeing with that monster, even in a single particular.
[00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:24.569]  The specter of Hitler has led some scientists to stray from ought to is and deny that breeding for human qualities is even possible.
[00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:32.977]  But if you can breed cattle for milk, horses for speed, dogs for skill, why shouldn't you breed humans for mathematical, musical, or athletic ability?
[00:30:33.418 --> 00:30:41.766]  I wonder some 60 years after Hitler's death why we might at least venture to ask what the moral difference is between breeding for musical ability
[00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:46.569]  And the problem is with breeding, you're talking about exterminating most of the puppies or kittens that are born.
[00:30:46.829 --> 00:30:49.111]  You're talking about the state having this incredible control.
[00:30:49.491 --> 00:30:54.074]  And in special breeds, you get more mental illness, more inherited diseases.
[00:30:54.154 --> 00:30:59.798]  And the elites that are bred, most of their children were born retarded or had serious mental illness problems.
[00:31:00.038 --> 00:31:01.979]  But do they give up this system of control?
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.622]  No, they've only intensified it down throughout the last hundred plus years.
[00:31:07.683 --> 00:31:13.246]  And now they're practicing their eugenics upon us through the vaccines, through the chemtrails, through the entire system.
[00:31:13.266 --> 00:31:22.432]  Aaron, I want to have you back up in a couple weeks again for a whole other discussion and other areas of eugenics because this is the governing system, the ideology of the New World Order.
[00:31:22.472 --> 00:31:27.555]  We've got a special guest coming up after the break, a lot of key videos and things from what happened in Denver.
[00:31:28.055 --> 00:31:29.996]  With the MSNBC staff attacking us.
[00:31:30.016 --> 00:31:31.236]  This is going up on YouTube later.

[00:32:17.272 --> 00:32:18.372]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:19.392]  Call now.

[00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:39.426]  Read up on us.
[00:32:39.946 --> 00:32:42.728]  You have nothing to lose, but wait.
[00:32:46.579 --> 00:32:52.982]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:32:53.322 --> 00:32:55.303]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:32:55.964 --> 00:32:57.004]  But who is the enemy?
[00:32:57.525 --> 00:32:58.025]  Bin Laden.
[00:32:58.305 --> 00:32:59.125]  This is his M.O.
[00:32:59.185 --> 00:33:00.666]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:33:00.686 --> 00:33:02.407]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:33:02.687 --> 00:33:09.431]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:33:09.831 --> 00:33:10.271]  Some U.S.
[00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:15.994]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:33:16.654 --> 00:33:20.135]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:33:20.155 --> 00:33:22.956]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:33:48.246 --> 00:34:03.762]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90-year-old grandmother at some length here recently, and she was talking about the Great Depression, and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices, this economic uncertainty we're in, these, you know, really kind of perilous times, no one knows where we're headed, or where we might end up, and she was remindi- Stepnowski there?
[00:34:04.122 --> 00:34:04.802]  Yep, he's still there.
[00:34:05.243 --> 00:34:09.905]  Folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens and can their food.
[00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:17.628]  But how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how and they didn't have the chickens and the livestock.
[00:34:17.748 --> 00:34:18.988]  So it's a lot different for them.
[00:34:19.108 --> 00:34:20.989]  Well, we know one thing's certain right now.
[00:34:21.029 --> 00:34:24.831]  We're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage.
[00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:26.092]  Now what can you do to prepare?
[00:34:26.112 --> 00:34:26.932]  Do what I did.
[00:34:27.112 --> 00:34:28.573]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[00:34:28.673 --> 00:34:31.354]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens eFoodsDirect.com company.
[00:34:31.474 --> 00:34:33.275]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.

[00:34:34.936 --> 00:34:36.017]  You deserve security.
[00:34:36.097 --> 00:34:37.077]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:34:37.097 --> 00:34:37.698]  eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:34:37.818 --> 00:34:38.498]  Put some food away.
[00:34:38.518 --> 00:34:38.978]  Do it now.
[00:34:38.998 --> 00:34:39.058]  1-800-409-5633.

[00:34:54.886 --> 00:34:55.707]  You want answers?
[00:34:56.468 --> 00:34:58.391]  Well, so does he.
[00:34:58.411 --> 00:35:01.715]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:35:02.216 --> 00:35:06.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:12.730]  Well, we've got one of the most famous linemen in NFL history, Mark Stepnoski, on with us.
[00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.652]  Pro career in the NFL.
[00:35:15.212 --> 00:35:17.835]  Most of it spent with the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Oilers.
[00:35:18.335 --> 00:35:22.379]  He won two Super Bowls, one with the Cowboys and one as a five-time Pro Bowler.
[00:35:23.616 --> 00:35:25.497]  And he is a 9-11 truther.
[00:35:25.537 --> 00:35:27.778]  We had him on almost a year ago.
[00:35:27.798 --> 00:35:28.978]  It was a long time ago.
[00:35:29.238 --> 00:35:30.358]  Time just flies by.
[00:35:30.378 --> 00:35:31.359]  It seems like yesterday.
[00:35:31.379 --> 00:35:37.361]  And he also campaigns for the legalization of marijuana, the decriminalization.
[00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:40.362]  You got 80 plus percent of drug users only use marijuana.
[00:35:40.822 --> 00:35:52.529]  They need to keep it that way so that they can keep it illegal so they can SWAT team raid more people and fill more prisons while the government has been caught hundreds of times shipping in heroin and cocaine and laundering the money.
[00:35:52.789 --> 00:35:56.512]  Did you know it's legal for foreign drug money to be invested in the New York Stock Exchange?
[00:35:56.912 --> 00:36:04.177]  And the former head, Richard Grasso, when he was head of the New York Stock Exchange, was in Reuters going to the FARC, communist guerrillas, and saying, invest your cocaine money with us.
[00:36:04.697 --> 00:36:08.279]  I'm going off on a rant here about the decriminalization of marijuana.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:14.884]  They need to keep it illegal because, what is it, 86, 87 percent of people only smoke marijuana that use illegal drugs.
[00:36:15.364 --> 00:36:16.605]  George Washington smoked it.
[00:36:17.906 --> 00:36:20.167]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is an excuse.
[00:36:20.427 --> 00:36:21.228]  What's a greater crime?
[00:36:21.268 --> 00:36:23.789]  Guys in black masks, SWAT teaming you at 3 a.m.?
[00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.891]  Or somebody smoking marijuana?
[00:36:26.371 --> 00:36:29.995]  You know, do we want this great evil in the name of stopping this minor evil?
[00:36:30.756 --> 00:36:32.097]  And I'm not a marijuana person.
[00:36:32.398 --> 00:36:35.801]  I've smoked marijuana, and it's just not my cup of tea.
[00:36:36.242 --> 00:36:40.887]  But I know a lot of people that do smoke it, a lot of doctors and lawyers and people, and they don't need to be SWAT teamed.
[00:36:41.247 --> 00:36:44.231]  Mark Stepnowski, I really appreciate you coming on with us today.
[00:36:45.253 --> 00:36:47.154]  Thanks Alex, it's good to be on with you today.
[00:37:15.954 --> 00:37:24.842]  Yeah, I think it's great to see, you know, like you said, as time goes on, more and more people are coming forward as they gradually become aware of the facts.
[00:37:26.123 --> 00:37:37.854]  Obviously, you know, through online research and through the amount of books and magazines that have come out now, you know, enough authors have come forward, stated their opinion, and I think what's really important now is
[00:37:39.028 --> 00:37:48.911]  You know, obviously, people early on, shortly after the 9-11 attacks, were kind of pigeonholed as conspiracy theorists, but now...
[00:37:49.864 --> 00:38:01.830]  That label, it never did apply, but it's less applicable now than ever, simply because the people who are coming out in favor of 9-11 Truth are too credible to ignore.
[00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:11.914]  You know, in the last few years we've had the formation of things like Scholars for 9-11 Truth, which includes architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth.
[00:38:13.296 --> 00:38:15.059]  Uh, pilots for 9-11 Truth.
[00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:24.436]  We have, uh, former, uh, people who worked in government, uh, including the current administration, who are coming out and saying that they don't believe the official story.
[00:38:25.365 --> 00:38:39.469]  So it's just a case of, you know, as more people become exposed to it, as the media blackouts and mainstream media continues, mostly via the Internet, people are becoming connected and becoming aware of these facts and voicing their opinion.
[00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.570]  It's very encouraging to see.
[00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:51.993]  You know, it's never too late for anybody who feels strongly about this issue to come forward and voice their opinion, because I think
[00:38:52.797 --> 00:39:12.481]  As time goes on, people will be surprised to find out that if they are no longer worried about expressing their skepticism of the official story regarding 9-11, they will find out that there are a lot of people out there, you might refer to them as a silent majority, who also feel very much the same way.
[00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:21.803]  They are either too afraid or too reluctant to come forward and also express their doubts in the official story.
[00:39:22.023 --> 00:39:23.804]  What made you go public?
[00:39:23.844 --> 00:39:29.867]  You were one of the first prominent sports figures to go public.
[00:39:30.588 --> 00:39:32.549]  Now Willie Nelson has gone public.
[00:39:33.209 --> 00:39:35.050]  Jesse Ventura has gone public.
[00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.691]  It's just exponential.
[00:39:38.512 --> 00:39:40.373]  What made you decide to take that leap?
[00:39:43.604 --> 00:39:51.208]  You know, I got tired of waiting for the channels of government to move along in a proper fashion.
[00:39:52.569 --> 00:39:55.610]  You know, like a lot of people, I had hope.
[00:39:56.471 --> 00:40:04.275]  It turns out to be false hope, in retrospect, but I had hope at the time that maybe the 9-11 Commission would be legitimate.
[00:40:07.119 --> 00:40:15.647]  You know, the safeguards that are in place in constitutional government, I thought that they would kick in and operate in the manner in which they're supposed to.
[00:40:15.827 --> 00:40:23.174]  And we would see a proper investigation, you know, with relevant witnesses and evidence.
[00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:29.234]  And, as we all know, none of that really came to fruition.
[00:40:29.534 --> 00:40:32.136]  The 9-11 Commission was a sham.
[00:40:32.156 --> 00:40:33.197]  It was a cover-up.
[00:40:33.277 --> 00:40:42.944]  It was a modern-day version of the Warren Commission, as far as its attempt to silence witnesses and suppress truth-tellers.
[00:40:43.805 --> 00:40:52.311]  And, you know, when things reached that point, and that commission was shown to be the impotent vehicle that it was,
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:41:00.045]  I just felt compelled to, in my own small way, say whatever I could as far as what I thought the truth was.
[00:41:00.185 --> 00:41:02.806]  Well, Mark, that isn't in your own small way.
[00:41:03.567 --> 00:41:07.650]  It's not just that you're a celebrity or a well-known sports figure.
[00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:16.976]  It's that people resonate with the courage of a Willie Nelson or a Mark Stepnowski or a former German defense minister or a former governor.
[00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:18.237]  They resonate
[00:41:18.937 --> 00:41:21.398]  And they know that person has a lot to lose.
[00:41:21.438 --> 00:41:22.818]  That person's going to be demonized.
[00:41:22.858 --> 00:41:24.899]  This person is really stepping up.
[00:41:25.339 --> 00:41:29.561]  And so that's what makes you and so many others that have stood up and gone public heroes.
[00:41:29.601 --> 00:41:30.781]  But look at the vindication.
[00:41:30.801 --> 00:41:39.324]  The Chicago Tribune, four months ago, reported, as well as Associated Press, the NSA declassified that Israel did attack the U.S.'
[00:41:39.304 --> 00:41:44.786]  's liberty to try to sink it, to blame it on Egypt to start World War III, as they've now tried, the U.S.
[00:41:44.806 --> 00:41:46.087]  has tried in Georgia.
[00:41:47.227 --> 00:41:53.808]  It's now come out, Sy Hersh at a big media event, and he did admit in New Yorker Magazine that Cheney, he just said a staged provocation.
[00:41:53.868 --> 00:41:57.209]  He said, this is the provocation to have U.S.
[00:41:58.109 --> 00:42:03.270]  Navy SEALs dressed up like Iranians on blue PT boats attack U.S.
[00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:04.771]  ships in the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:42:05.731 --> 00:42:15.473]  So, government-sponsored terror, the fact that Gulf of Tonkin was staged, that's all coming out now, and people say, well that was seven years ago, you know, 9-11, why are you so concerned?
[00:42:15.813 --> 00:42:16.213]  Well, because
[00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:26.115]  Black Ops is going to continue to stage terror attacks as a pretext for control if we don't step up and expose that they're behind it.
[00:42:26.395 --> 00:42:27.535]  Mark your comments on that.
[00:42:28.775 --> 00:42:30.076]  Yeah, I entirely agree.
[00:42:31.276 --> 00:42:33.077]  It's been a steady progression.
[00:42:33.137 --> 00:42:36.158]  It's been just one instant after another.
[00:42:36.198 --> 00:42:43.180]  We saw last year where Bush and Tony Blair had the plan to send U.S.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.621]  military planes over Iran disguised as U.N.
[00:42:46.661 --> 00:42:47.041]  planes.
[00:42:47.822 --> 00:42:52.766]  To try and instigate an attack on them so we would be justified in responding.
[00:42:52.786 --> 00:43:12.140]  I remember also last year's a big Noobazinsky appearing in the press practically coming right out and saying, you know, we had to worry about the current administration putting together a false flag terror op to stimulate war with Iran.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.741]  This is a guy who is now
[00:43:14.582 --> 00:43:15.143]  I think?
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:36.143]  So I just think in this day and age, people are becoming a little bit too hit to what's going on.
[00:43:36.183 --> 00:43:38.084]  They understand ahead of time.
[00:43:38.145 --> 00:43:42.887]  Similar to what happened in Spain when you had the false flag terror attack there with the train.
[00:43:42.947 --> 00:43:48.731]  The people within days came out in the hundreds of thousands and said, we know you did it, and it turned out it was the intelligence operation.
[00:43:49.511 --> 00:43:50.172]  Exactly.
[00:43:50.192 --> 00:43:56.476]  Hopefully we are reaching that point now in North America, if you call it critical mass or whatever you want to.
[00:43:57.748 --> 00:44:06.974]  Hopefully through, you know, the work that you do and statements made by 9-11 truthers like myself and the many others around the world.
[00:44:06.994 --> 00:44:14.059]  You know, we have people, a politician in Japanese Parliament came out wanting to have another investigation.
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:26.167]  We're having a march in Canada to Ottawa to culminate on September 11th where they're going to present a petition at Parliament Hill for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada.
[00:44:28.649 --> 00:44:38.596]  So I think, you know, worldwide you are seeing people come around and, you know, waking up to the fact that this was a false flag operation, you know, to have a certain effect on the American public.
[00:44:38.636 --> 00:44:54.268]  The question now is, you know, are the people who live in America going to be smart enough to look into the right sources of information to kind of emancipate themselves from this media blackout that's going on?
[00:44:55.009 --> 00:44:57.331]  I think if people, you know, continue to
[00:44:58.331 --> 00:45:15.066]  Turn off their TVs, give less credence to mainstream media, corporate media, and instead, you know, read online, read books, read magazines, anything out there that's going to give the true story of 9-11 truth.
[00:45:16.668 --> 00:45:23.554]  This is what's going to mobilize the population in America so that when another false flag terrorist attack occurs,
[00:45:24.671 --> 00:45:37.202]  Whatever it is, whether it's bioterror, whether it's a mini-nuke somewhere, people will see it for what it is and not be railroaded into a certain mindset like they were after 9-11.
[00:45:38.154 --> 00:45:59.937]  We're talking to Super Bowl champion, two-time Mark Stepnoski, five-time pro bowler, and he's, again, going public, not because it's fun, but because it's his duty, and I would venture to say because he just said it, he knows that if we don't expose the tool of false flag, that mechanism, this military-industrial complex is going to keep doing it to hurt us.
[00:46:00.478 --> 00:46:02.561]  Just like in England how they hunt pheasants.
[00:46:02.921 --> 00:46:04.383]  They beat pots and pans.
[00:46:04.423 --> 00:46:09.529]  They have beaters who push the birds out in a wedge so the hunters can shoot them when they get driven out.
[00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:10.731]  And it's the same thing.
[00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:11.772]  You want to attack Iran?
[00:46:11.832 --> 00:46:12.793]  You want to attack Iraq?
[00:46:12.813 --> 00:46:13.634]  You stage an event.
[00:46:14.155 --> 00:46:15.136]  You want to attack Egypt?
[00:46:15.176 --> 00:46:15.977]  You stage an event.
[00:46:16.277 --> 00:46:18.560]  They've been caught over and over and...
[00:46:19.554 --> 00:46:22.335]  They're going to continue to do this if we don't expose it.
[00:46:22.876 --> 00:46:33.881]  And that's why the courage of now thousands of prominent people that have gone public for 9-11 truth and now all these architects and engineers and physicists is unstoppable.
[00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:39.985]  We're going to come back and talk about the fraudulent new NIST report with Mark Stepnoski and then we're going to take your phone calls.
[00:46:40.345 --> 00:46:40.805]  Stay with us.
[00:46:40.825 --> 00:46:41.505]  We'll be right back.
[00:46:45.788 --> 00:46:46.768]  On September 11th, 2001, along with
[00:46:48.979 --> 00:46:51.201]  Hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:46:51.481 --> 00:46:52.602]  And we knew what to do.
[00:46:52.722 --> 00:46:54.563]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:46:54.803 --> 00:46:56.304]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11.
[00:46:56.324 --> 00:46:58.286]  Fellow troops, I went to ground zero.
[00:46:58.546 --> 00:46:59.867]  And we knew what to do.
[00:46:59.887 --> 00:47:01.628]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:47:01.868 --> 00:47:08.233]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:47:08.912 --> 00:47:17.455]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:47:17.795 --> 00:47:24.578]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:47:24.878 --> 00:47:27.959]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[00:47:28.039 --> 00:47:33.802]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:47:33.822 --> 00:47:36.543]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:47:36.563 --> 00:47:42.786]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.

[00:47:45.887 --> 00:47:50.789]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:47:52.305 --> 00:47:55.927]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[00:47:56.247 --> 00:47:59.769]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[00:48:52.708 --> 00:49:01.431]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:49:01.611 --> 00:49:06.413]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:49:06.773 --> 00:49:17.897]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:49:18.297 --> 00:49:23.842]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:30.148]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:49:30.328 --> 00:49:30.969]  What about you?
[00:49:31.369 --> 00:49:33.291]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[00:49:54.523 --> 00:49:58.167]  The Army-Navy store from your memory as a child is just that, a memory.
[00:49:58.267 --> 00:50:02.652]  But there is still one place to find everything from gas masks to ammo cans and find it cheap.

[00:50:43.702 --> 00:50:44.003]  That's 877-608-0179.
[00:50:59.676 --> 00:51:02.317]  Two-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys.
[00:51:02.357 --> 00:51:03.318]  Also played with the Oilers.
[00:51:03.338 --> 00:51:04.478]  Five-time Pro Bowler.
[00:51:05.139 --> 00:51:06.799]  Mark Stepnoski on the line.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:11.722]  I remember sitting around watching the Cowboys play and rooting for Mark.
[00:51:12.242 --> 00:51:15.664]  And now I'm rooting for him in a much more important way and that is his courage.
[00:51:16.224 --> 00:51:22.568]  Speaking out for 9-11 Truth, there's a ballot initiative in New York to get a new investigation going or expose that, a grand jury.
[00:51:22.588 --> 00:51:24.330]  There's a lot of different initiatives.
[00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:29.333]  There's marches going on, events coming up in New York next week that I hope folks go to.
[00:51:31.114 --> 00:51:36.298]  Let's talk about that ballot initiative first, and then I want to get into the NIST report, Mark.
[00:51:37.478 --> 00:51:42.522]  Yeah, obviously, since we're coming up on the anniversary of 9-11, there's a lot of activities going around.
[00:51:43.277 --> 00:51:46.058]  To highlight the fact that the official story is untrue.
[00:51:46.558 --> 00:51:48.979]  One of those is in New York City.
[00:51:49.019 --> 00:51:50.899]  It's a 9-11 ballot initiative.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:52:00.242]  This is a way for, I mean, it's obvious that, like I said earlier, that we're not going to get a proper investigation through government channels.
[00:52:00.362 --> 00:52:10.705]  But this is a way for the people of New York City to create a new 9-11 commission, an investigation of the events, which would have subpoena power.
[00:52:10.745 --> 00:52:12.466]  It would have some legal authority.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.901]  Volunteers in New York City have been going around getting signatures on petitions.
[00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:21.882]  They needed a minimum of 30,000, which they just recently achieved.
[00:52:22.282 --> 00:52:23.502]  So that was great news.
[00:52:23.802 --> 00:52:29.903]  And now these petitions will be submitted to the New York City Clerk and New York City Council.
[00:52:30.644 --> 00:52:40.806]  And with a sufficient amount of signatures, this being above 30,000, they will be able to present this and then it can become
[00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:42.910]  Absolutely, and
[00:53:12.503 --> 00:53:13.543]  It shouldn't just be New York.
[00:53:13.563 --> 00:53:22.027]  We need lots of grand jury-type public investigations, both governmental and non-governmental, to draw this out publicly and continue to expose it.
[00:53:22.107 --> 00:53:31.030]  Everything is a step, to use a football analogy, for more yards to get a new set of downs towards the touchdown, bringing these criminals to justice.
[00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.972]  And even if we never bring them to justice by sending them to prison,
[00:53:35.732 --> 00:53:45.997]  By publicly convicting them in the court of public opinion, and by educating the public about false flag terrorism, it breaks that tool that the black ops continue to use.
[00:53:46.077 --> 00:53:46.978]  Mark, your take on that?
[00:53:48.419 --> 00:53:49.639]  Yeah, without a doubt.
[00:53:49.779 --> 00:53:52.741]  It's all a question of, you know, just mobilizing the masses.
[00:53:52.821 --> 00:53:57.663]  I think a lot of people fall into a defeatist attitude of, you know, what can I do?
[00:53:58.264 --> 00:53:59.364]  How can I make a difference?
[00:53:59.464 --> 00:54:00.545]  I'm only one person.
[00:54:01.624 --> 00:54:11.055]  Well, just by signing that petition, just by signing your name on that piece of paper, you are, in effect, saying, look, I don't believe in what the government is telling me.
[00:54:11.075 --> 00:54:14.900]  I don't believe the lies that I'm being told in corporate media.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.923]  You know, I demand a new investigation.
[00:54:17.983 --> 00:54:21.748]  This is one way for people to have their voice heard, people who otherwise
[00:54:22.435 --> 00:54:23.436]  Might feel powerless.
[00:54:24.416 --> 00:54:26.097]  There's a lot of people in New York City.
[00:54:26.318 --> 00:54:30.780]  If a lot of them mobilize, it might be surprising what could actually happen.
[00:54:30.981 --> 00:54:39.266]  But, you know, I urge listeners of your show who either live in New York City or have family or friends there to let them know about this.
[00:54:40.026 --> 00:54:50.413]  They can look it up on www.nyc911initiative.org and find out anything they would like to about this movement.
[00:54:50.593 --> 00:54:51.534]  But I think that
[00:54:52.603 --> 00:54:58.507]  Yeah, right now it's moving along very nicely, and should it succeed in any degree, it'll be a big step forward.
[00:54:58.547 --> 00:54:59.988]  It really could be a breakthrough.
[00:55:00.068 --> 00:55:04.871]  And a lot of people have this loser mentality of, oh, it'll never be corruption, oh, there's no point.
[00:55:05.331 --> 00:55:07.313]  Ladies and gentlemen, we don't have a choice, number one.
[00:55:07.353 --> 00:55:09.114]  Number two, we're actually having an effect.
[00:55:09.594 --> 00:55:12.637]  The majority of Americans in major polls believe there's a 9-11 cover-up.
[00:55:12.657 --> 00:55:13.738]  There's hundreds of these polls.
[00:55:14.158 --> 00:55:15.439]  We're having an effect.
[00:55:15.479 --> 00:55:23.006]  Look how far we've come from myself two months before the attack saying, I think they're going to attack the World Trade Center and blame it on their asset Bin Laden.
[00:55:23.126 --> 00:55:25.968]  Because I saw them preparing the public, introducing Bin Laden.
[00:55:25.988 --> 00:55:27.029]  I knew their past history.
[00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:34.056]  I knew the FBI had cooked a bomb, framed the driver, given them the detonators, blocked local police in 93 with the first attack.
[00:55:35.056 --> 00:55:37.978]  I mean, again, look how far we've come from 9-11 that first day.
[00:55:38.498 --> 00:55:45.922]  Look how far we've come thanks to people like Mark Stepnoski, Willie Nelson, Governor Ventura, Stephen Jones.
[00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:49.084]  Now, I'm going to skip this break for InfoWars.com.
[00:55:49.104 --> 00:55:51.145]  For everybody else, we'll be back in three minutes.
[00:55:51.185 --> 00:55:56.809]  I don't want to waste any time that we've got with Mark Stepnoski today, but Mark, that NIST report.
[00:55:57.594 --> 00:55:58.855]  They delayed it three years.
[00:55:58.975 --> 00:56:03.420]  The people on the government NIST board are involved in explosive thermite research.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:04.180]  They're experts.
[00:56:04.521 --> 00:56:06.122]  They're involved in government contracts.
[00:56:06.603 --> 00:56:09.866]  And then they had to pull back.
[00:56:10.086 --> 00:56:16.051]  They had to say, okay, our last five reasons for the towers falling and Building 7 falling are wrong.
[00:56:16.492 --> 00:56:17.733]  It's not fuel oil tank.
[00:56:17.793 --> 00:56:19.695]  It's not bad building construction.
[00:56:20.035 --> 00:56:21.036]  It's not fires.
[00:56:21.116 --> 00:56:21.457]  It's not
[00:56:22.077 --> 00:56:22.378]  No, no.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:27.249]  They gave a new reason, a new syndrome, a new phenomenon.
[00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:29.955]  We're going to cover that right now with Mark Stepnoski.
[00:56:29.975 --> 00:56:30.396]  Stay with us.
[00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.231]  Okay, we're going to go ahead and skip that break, Mark.
[00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:44.032]  A few stations won't hear us, but I don't want to waste any time and this will have a life of its own on the web.
[00:56:44.652 --> 00:56:48.633]  I mean, the NIST report now says thermal expansion did it.
[00:56:49.093 --> 00:56:52.314]  A new phenomenon never before seen, seen in three buildings in a row.
[00:56:52.734 --> 00:56:57.756]  They're now saying you may not even need a controlled demolition of a building, just go light a few small fires.
[00:56:58.576 --> 00:57:10.158]  I mean, they're having to re-engineer reality and insurance companies are having to change their whole view just to fit with something that never before happened, just like they've had thousands of taser deaths worldwide.
[00:57:10.458 --> 00:57:17.260]  They've now announced they believe it's a syndrome that the taser scares the person and makes them have a heart attack, Mark.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:26.582]  I mean, now the BS, like claiming Russia attacked Georgia three weeks ago when it's admitted that the U.S.-backed Georgians attacked first, I mean, we're entering
[00:57:28.263 --> 00:57:31.486]  Like an Alice in Wonderland, the propaganda is getting so crazy.
[00:57:32.027 --> 00:57:32.888]  Can you comment on that?
[00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.620]  No question.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:40.181]  I mean, we are living in Orwell's world now, where language has been entirely manipulated.
[00:57:40.381 --> 00:57:49.043]  You know, language has become, at least politically and in the media and news, we've seen language become a tool of obfuscation.
[00:57:49.063 --> 00:57:52.304]  You know, it's been used to just confuse people.
[00:57:53.464 --> 00:57:58.025]  It's been used, you know, these slogans that the Republican Party comes up with.
[00:57:58.105 --> 00:58:01.686]  It's just a bastardization of the language.
[00:58:02.851 --> 00:58:07.637]  Obviously with this NIST report, you can see them in full damage control mode.
[00:58:07.697 --> 00:58:12.042]  You know, it's obvious they've been stonewalling for years now.
[00:58:12.462 --> 00:58:14.004]  They're forced to release something.
[00:58:14.673 --> 00:58:20.698]  They have to come up with the least harebrained thing they can think of, and even that carries no weight whatsoever.
[00:58:22.519 --> 00:58:29.705]  Anybody who wants to, obviously you can listen to Stephen Jones, who's talked about thermate in the buildings.
[00:58:29.745 --> 00:58:33.388]  They can listen to a guy, Richard Gage, who is an architect for 9-11 Truth.
[00:58:35.402 --> 00:58:42.925]  You know, you can get an entire scientific rundown of why the government's explanation is so far-fetched, it's unbelievable.
[00:58:43.105 --> 00:58:47.506]  I mean, really, what they're asking us to believe, it's exactly what you said.
[00:58:47.566 --> 00:59:02.391]  They expect us to discount every law of physics that we've ever learned or that's ever existed, and somehow just accept with blind faith these new theories they come out with that have absolutely no credibility whatsoever.
[00:59:02.551 --> 00:59:05.672]  Well, I think it's brought them into a trap, and I want you to speak to this.
[00:59:05.712 --> 00:59:31.584]  I think it's brought them into a trap now, because all these other mainline physicists, architects, engineers are going, wait a minute, and now they're looking at the NIST report and it's becoming like a Copernicus or a Galileo court debate, and other scientists are now looking going, wait a minute, new phenomenon, new, you know, 1500 degree fires, you know, do what only 2800 would do, and wait, you know, the aerial photos from NASA,
[00:59:32.404 --> 00:59:35.488]  Do show 3,000 degrees, 2,600 degrees.
[00:59:35.528 --> 00:59:37.670]  They're like, wait a minute.
[00:59:38.351 --> 00:59:46.200]  So in a way, they're claiming physics has changed, is widening the debate and backfiring on them.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:47.301]  I want you to comment on that.
[00:59:47.501 --> 00:59:48.963]  We're coming back live to the full audience.
[00:59:48.983 --> 00:59:49.324]  Here we go.
[00:59:52.210 --> 01:00:09.644]  Mark Stepnowski, we're bringing up the NIST report and how they've had to change how physics works and so a lot of scientists and physicists and architects that weren't involved and didn't believe it was an inside job are now looking going, you're saying jet fuel made 2600 degree pockets of stuff five weeks later?
[01:00:10.164 --> 01:00:11.385]  Thousands of degrees hotter?
[01:00:11.405 --> 01:00:19.311]  I mean, NIST coming out and saying now small fires bring down steel buildings is changing everything.
[01:00:19.611 --> 01:00:20.292]  Mark, continue.
[01:00:21.567 --> 01:00:29.454]  Yeah, I mean, this coincides with the Bush administration's technique from day one.
[01:00:29.514 --> 01:00:37.021]  They have actively sought to discredit science and to really argue with scientific beliefs.
[01:00:37.361 --> 01:00:48.831]  You know, it doesn't matter whether it's the EPA, the FDA, whatever it is, you know, there's been an active warfare on the part of the Bush administration against science.
[01:00:49.642 --> 01:00:52.623]  And this is another clear-cut example of that.
[01:00:52.664 --> 01:00:53.724]  Well, it's like marijuana.
[01:00:53.824 --> 01:00:55.805]  They know marijuana doesn't kill one person a year.
[01:00:56.085 --> 01:01:05.350]  It's a miracle drug with thousands of patented real things it does for cancer, glaucoma, but they're still SWAT teaming people every day where I live looking for marijuana.
[01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:07.250]  Absolutely.
[01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:10.252]  No matter how much evidence you
[01:01:11.092 --> 01:01:12.093]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:01:30.111 --> 01:01:37.094]  But again, you know, corporate media, the Republican or Democratic Party, they'll just write it off as propaganda.
[01:01:37.134 --> 01:01:40.076]  But that is starting... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:53.122]  I'm sorry, but that is what we are seeing right now, which is another, by this NIST report, trying to come out and explain why something that's never happened before did happen, namely three steel buildings collapsing because of fire in one day.
[01:01:53.642 --> 01:01:56.063]  They do have to stretch the realms of reality.
[01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:58.164]  You know, they do have to contradict science.
[01:01:58.604 --> 01:01:59.385]  I'm glad you're here.
[01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:25.149]  You know, these are things that are coming out in scientific journals and academic papers.
[01:02:25.189 --> 01:02:26.050]  They're peer-reviewed.
[01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:30.155]  These are not things that appear on the evening news or are going to be on a front-page headline.
[01:02:30.175 --> 01:02:31.257]  You know, that's a great point.
[01:02:31.877 --> 01:02:32.758]  First, they said,
[01:02:34.039 --> 01:02:36.781]  Like three or four years ago, oh, let's see some studies.
[01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:37.701]  And then they did studies.
[01:02:37.741 --> 01:02:38.802]  Let's see them be peer-reviewed.
[01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:48.248]  Then a couple of them get peer-reviewed by major, major peer-reviewed, I mean, not just side journals, big marquee, you know, Super Bowl-level journals.
[01:02:48.288 --> 01:02:49.348]  We're talking the big ones.
[01:02:49.689 --> 01:02:50.829]  You know, the most prestigious.
[01:02:51.169 --> 01:02:52.930]  And then they try to write that off.
[01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:58.514]  I mean, we keep clearing every hurdle, Mark, and the other side is just looking stupider and stupider.
[01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:04.815]  And I believe that NIST itself is part of the executive branch, correct?
[01:03:04.835 --> 01:03:05.395]  Yes, yes.
[01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:18.077]  So there we see another example, you know, just like the Office of National Drug Control Policy is part of the executive branch, and they are the ones who constantly spew forth misinformation about the drug war.
[01:03:18.498 --> 01:03:25.599]  We have NIST, which is also an executive branch administration, you know, leading the charge about the lies regarding 9-11.
[01:03:27.526 --> 01:03:31.691]  Well, like you said, though, more and more people are tuning out of mainstream media.
[01:03:31.811 --> 01:03:42.944]  It's exponential, and instead of them reporting some of the truth or trying to act more credible, it seems like they're getting more shrill, more cartoonish, more ridiculous, piling lie on top of lie.
[01:03:43.525 --> 01:03:46.449]  I don't know what the tactic is there, but it doesn't seem to be working, Mark.
[01:03:47.418 --> 01:03:53.762]  Well, it reminds me of the old quote about, and I can't remember who said it, but it's just the old quote about truth coming out, you know.
[01:03:54.302 --> 01:04:10.531]  First, when you are a truth teller, you know, in this age of universal deceit that we live in, where those of us are trying to commit a revolutionary act by telling the truth, you know, it becomes evident that, you know, we will be attacked
[01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:13.103]  That's the first method.
[01:04:14.304 --> 01:04:19.848]  Actually, the first method is to be written off and ridiculed, and that was the case early on after September 11th.
[01:04:19.888 --> 01:04:24.412]  We were all pigeonholed as conspiracy terrorists and we were out of our minds, so that was the ridicule.
[01:04:24.873 --> 01:04:28.636]  Then you had the vicious attacks, and now it's becoming obvious that
[01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:33.964]  You know, the 9-11 truth movement is based on truth and facts and evidence.
[01:04:34.385 --> 01:04:38.007]  We are being maliciously attacked.
[01:04:38.147 --> 01:04:46.531]  Yes, and that's... And then, you know, I just want to follow up by, again, with that famous quotation, the third stage of the truth being accepted is that people will accept it.
[01:04:47.372 --> 01:04:49.373]  So I think now we are in the second stage.
[01:04:49.393 --> 01:04:52.054]  You know, those first years we were attacked and vilified.
[01:04:52.695 --> 01:04:54.576]  I'm sorry, we were ridiculed.
[01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:56.757]  Now we are being attacked and vilified.
[01:04:57.631 --> 01:05:13.563]  Hopefully we are coming close to that third stage where there will be mass acceptance of this truth and people won't be afraid to put aside their cognitive dissonance and step out and accept this new paradigm of reality that we all have to see around us.
[01:05:13.983 --> 01:05:14.924]  Oh, beautifully put.
[01:05:15.004 --> 01:05:16.085]  And that's really it.
[01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:31.276]  I don't blame a lot of people who don't want to look at the facts, because every night when I go to bed, I look at how innocent my children are, I look at how good my wife is, and I just think, God, there are really evil people in this world, and they really are in control, and I've really gotten their face, and man, I've been threatened, and this is dangerous.
[01:05:31.776 --> 01:05:34.779]  Then I realized, you know, I just can't let the world go on like this.
[01:05:34.819 --> 01:05:37.661]  I've got to do my job, whether it has an effect or not.
[01:05:37.681 --> 01:05:43.205]  But the truth is, when good people do get involved, I believe as Thomas Jefferson said, that we can't overturn evil.
[01:05:43.466 --> 01:05:46.908]  Evil only wins when good men and women do nothing.
[01:05:47.669 --> 01:05:48.169]  And you're right.
[01:05:48.249 --> 01:05:51.412]  First they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:05:51.892 --> 01:05:54.314]  And that's basically what's happening now.
[01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:57.797]  And there's another quote I'm butchering, paraphrasing.
[01:05:58.097 --> 01:05:59.859]  But, you know, truth goes through three stages.
[01:06:00.399 --> 01:06:06.424]  First it's laughed at, then it's ridiculed, then it's accepted as universally true.
[01:06:07.085 --> 01:06:10.908]  And people who said the world was round were laughed at, and now we know it's round, Mark.
[01:06:12.089 --> 01:06:17.714]  For me personally, again, I think we should all just do what we can.
[01:06:18.895 --> 01:06:23.839]  Different people have different amounts of time, different resources, be they financial or whatever.
[01:06:24.744 --> 01:06:29.426]  But I just felt personally as an American citizen, it was my duty to speak out.
[01:06:29.526 --> 01:06:35.808]  You know, I was asked to do a newspaper article for my hometown.
[01:06:36.648 --> 01:06:39.609]  And it was just one of those deals, where are they now?
[01:06:39.709 --> 01:06:41.630]  What are they doing now that they're retired?
[01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:48.932]  And I just, again, I felt compelled to at least let people in Erie, Pennsylvania, my hometown, who read the paper,
[01:06:49.847 --> 01:07:00.317]  No, that somebody who came from there doesn't believe in the official story of 9-11 and wholeheartedly believes that they too should seek out the truth for themselves.
[01:07:00.677 --> 01:07:09.786]  What type of response, I know overwhelmingly it was positive, but what type of negative responses did you get and what was it like with your moral courage to go through that and not recant?
[01:07:11.252 --> 01:07:15.299]  Um, well, you know, the reaction overwhelmingly was positive.
[01:07:15.339 --> 01:07:23.032]  I mean, I don't spend a lot of time in my hometown anymore, and I know that there were people who wrote in letters saying, you know, what's wrong with this guy?
[01:07:23.092 --> 01:07:24.715]  He's way out in that field.
[01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:38.323]  But like we discussed earlier and now that we are, you know, coming up on eight years after the fact, people are coming, I'm sorry, seven years after the fact, people are becoming aware of what actually happened that day.
[01:07:38.423 --> 01:07:42.664]  You know, the initial shock value of that psychological operation is wearing off.
[01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:45.385]  People are getting a chance to see what really went on behind the scenes.
[01:07:46.425 --> 01:07:50.246]  So I didn't really suffer much fallout at all.
[01:07:51.066 --> 01:07:52.067]  You know, it was just, again,
[01:07:53.641 --> 01:07:59.166]  Regardless of how many people might write in, there's always going to be a few, you know, who will just personally attack you.
[01:07:59.206 --> 01:08:01.908]  I experienced the same thing when I spoke out against marijuana laws.
[01:08:02.449 --> 01:08:09.895]  You know, you have people saying that you're not a good role model, you know, that you're a proponent of drug use and everything else.
[01:08:10.075 --> 01:08:20.885]  Yeah, but you go to a football game and there's liquor ads everywhere, which no doubt is bad for you, but then, you know, these guys with a whiskey bottle, how dare you be with that marijuana?
[01:08:21.905 --> 01:08:29.013]  Yeah, again, people have blinders on with certain respect to the war on drugs, just like they do with 9-11.
[01:08:29.633 --> 01:08:44.228]  So I just wanted to, again, for people in my hometown who might know who I am or what I stand for, at least they might know enough about me to know that I'm not just some guy spouting off, that I might be a guy who actually does have educated opinions.
[01:08:44.884 --> 01:08:48.907]  And it might be worth their while to follow up on what I said, because they might learn something.
[01:08:49.107 --> 01:08:49.628]  Absolutely.
[01:08:49.668 --> 01:08:51.529]  Let's take some calls from Mark Stepnoski.
[01:08:51.849 --> 01:08:56.373]  Mark, before we do that in the last 15 or 16 minutes, any other points you wanted to add?
[01:08:56.453 --> 01:08:57.894]  Anything else you wanted to point out?
[01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:05.776]  I would just like to tell people that they should make a personal commitment in their life to continue to educate themselves on these issues.
[01:09:05.796 --> 01:09:13.539]  You know, the easiest thing in the world is just to pigeonhole something and write it off, put a label on it, and say, I don't have to look into it any further.
[01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:18.701]  You know, they'll just categorize it as something they don't want to know, and then just move on.
[01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:20.022]  That's the easiest thing to do.
[01:09:20.402 --> 01:09:22.823]  And I say, intellectually, that's a lazy thing to do.
[01:09:23.522 --> 01:09:26.325]  I think people should take it upon themselves to have the initiative.
[01:09:26.725 --> 01:09:32.992]  If you're going to disprove something, if you're going to write it off, at least look into it and have an educated opinion about it.
[01:09:34.954 --> 01:09:39.658]  I know there's a lot of nonsense out there regarding any topic, including 9-11.
[01:09:42.421 --> 01:09:57.005]  I would just tell people to look into anything they can, like some of the things I mentioned earlier, scholars from 9-11 Truth, any 9-11 Truth chapter, you know, cities all over North America have their own separate 9-11 Truth factor.
[01:09:57.045 --> 01:10:05.607]  We have a great one here in Toronto, Vancouver, British Columbia, as well as Toronto and Ottawa, across Canada, just like in the States.
[01:10:06.107 --> 01:10:07.929]  I need to send you Truth Rising.
[01:10:08.129 --> 01:10:10.070]  We've got Canadian, U.S.
[01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:10.771]  9-11 Truth.
[01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:12.252]  We Are Change just exploding.
[01:10:12.933 --> 01:10:14.134]  That new film just came out.
[01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:16.015]  I know you've seen Terror Storm.
[01:10:16.035 --> 01:10:16.876]  What did you think of that film?
[01:10:17.938 --> 01:10:19.239]  I thought it was outstanding.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:21.842]  There are a lot of great movies out right now.
[01:10:21.862 --> 01:10:32.512]  There's a current one people can watch on YouTube called Shadowplay, which is an excellent synopsis of the 9-11 false flag terror attack.
[01:10:32.572 --> 01:10:37.577]  It's a film that's coming out in segments, and they can watch those on YouTube.
[01:10:37.617 --> 01:10:43.302]  That's an excellent education for anybody who wants to kind of get a crash course on this subject.
[01:10:43.482 --> 01:10:46.963]  Well, and remember folks, the evil people that did this are still there.
[01:10:47.103 --> 01:10:48.584]  And I wish they were in a cave.
[01:10:48.864 --> 01:10:51.425]  That's a lot less scary than knowing they're in control of our government.
[01:10:53.685 --> 01:10:54.686]  No question about it.
[01:10:54.746 --> 01:11:00.848]  I mean, we see now in a Dutch newspaper talk of an attack on Iran is imminent.
[01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:10.506]  You know, I'm so glad to see that you're at the Democratic National Convention, because people seem to think that if we get a Democrat in office, there's going to be big changes.
[01:11:10.586 --> 01:11:16.169]  But the Democratic Congress has already signed off on a preemptive nuclear attack against Iran.
[01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:17.310]  Absolutely.
[01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:23.774]  I don't know how anybody can expect anything to the contrary, should Democrats be in power.
[01:11:23.894 --> 01:11:26.095]  Yeah, and again, we're not bashing either party, folks.
[01:11:26.135 --> 01:11:35.499]  The point is, is that the corporates have taken over everything, and until we recognize that both parties have been taken over, we can never set about fixing the real problem if we're in that controlled paradigm.
[01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:43.783]  Again, five-time Pro Bowler, two-time Super Bowl champion, Mark Stepnoski is our guest, former Dallas Cowboy, Houston Oiler.
[01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:45.584]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:11:46.784 --> 01:11:51.866]  Tim in New York, and then we'll go to Adam, Tim, Casey, Victor, and others.
[01:11:51.886 --> 01:11:53.946]  So go ahead, you're on the air, Tim in New York.
[01:11:54.167 --> 01:11:57.488]  Hi Alex and Mark, give you a lot of credit for what you're doing.
[01:11:57.528 --> 01:12:05.630]  I'm involved in a situation here now where I'm experiencing my friend and girlfriend of 12 years is being soft-killed as we speak.
[01:12:06.231 --> 01:12:08.611]  She has a brother that's in the State Department.
[01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:16.034]  She gave him a copy of The Road to Tyranny in about 2002, and ever since then her family's really been against us.
[01:12:16.647 --> 01:12:19.008]  She was an experimental guinea pig back in 1958.
[01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:21.050]  We had her thymus radiated.
[01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:26.373]  She's always had lifelong allergies and actually a victim of sexual abuse when she was a child.
[01:12:26.413 --> 01:12:28.274]  Her mother brought foster kids into the house.
[01:12:29.015 --> 01:12:36.299]  On July of this year, she finally found out that she had a lot of thyroid problems and a lot of hormone deficiencies causing some memory problems.
[01:12:37.049 --> 01:12:37.109]  I'm
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.581]  I need to put the names, the emails, the facts.
[01:12:55.641 --> 01:12:56.842]  I need to confirm this happened.
[01:12:56.862 --> 01:12:58.262]  I believe you, but I need to confirm it.
[01:12:58.603 --> 01:13:00.544]  That's big news, so let me stop you.
[01:13:00.864 --> 01:13:07.647]  So because she was a 9-11 truther, she's been stuck in a mental ward, and we're starting to see this happen like the old Soviet Union.
[01:13:07.947 --> 01:13:14.370]  I'm going to get your name and number off air, and then we'll have you on as a guest if I can see some documents and confirm this.
[01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.131]  But we have seen calls.
[01:13:16.471 --> 01:13:17.792]  It's in the new film, Truth Rising.
[01:13:18.512 --> 01:13:19.453]  Yeah, no question.
[01:13:19.473 --> 01:13:21.275]  You'll see it across the board.
[01:13:21.656 --> 01:13:24.418]  Whether it's Geraldo Rivera or Bill Maher or any of these guys who
[01:13:41.764 --> 01:13:54.761]  You are in a position where they have a show on corporate media and the only way they're going to continue to maintain their show is to spout the lies of the current administration, you know, the corporate party line.
[01:13:54.781 --> 01:13:57.405]  They've been calling for violence against us is what blows me away.
[01:13:58.871 --> 01:14:08.016]  Yeah, well, again, you know, it's... I think Sinclair Lewis said, when fascism comes to America, it'll be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.
[01:14:08.436 --> 01:14:10.317]  Yep, that's what Ron Paul said and got in trouble.
[01:14:10.357 --> 01:14:13.939]  He's not saying Christians are bad, he's saying evil people will use that.
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.182]  Yeah, I mean, if that's not what we're seeing right now, I don't know what we're seeing.
[01:14:19.242 --> 01:14:25.145]  Because, you know, we are looking at, again, the corporate ownership of both political parties.
[01:14:26.741 --> 01:14:29.023]  Again, wrapped in a flag, carrying a cross.
[01:14:30.225 --> 01:14:40.775]  In defense of religion and freedom, they are trying to ramrod a whole system of laws through that is to the detriment of everybody.
[01:14:40.815 --> 01:14:43.058]  You got it, and it has nothing to do with Christianity.
[01:14:43.198 --> 01:14:45.901]  Adam in Texas, you're on the air with Mark Stipnoski, go ahead.
[01:14:45.921 --> 01:14:48.503]  Hey Mark, it's great to talk to you.
[01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:53.327]  I watched you through your career and some of the finest football I've ever seen.
[01:14:53.347 --> 01:14:59.537]  I was wondering if you caught Alex up there behind the MSNBC counter.
[01:15:01.058 --> 01:15:05.863]  I wonder if you've met anybody more tenacious and more wonderful than Alex Jones.
[01:15:06.584 --> 01:15:17.777]  I did see the clip online where T-Boom Pickens was being interviewed on MSNBC in the background.
[01:15:17.877 --> 01:15:20.019]  That was Minneapolis 9-11 Truth.
[01:15:20.059 --> 01:15:22.101]  We took over for three hours at the DNC.
[01:15:23.764 --> 01:15:25.045]  I think that's outstanding.
[01:15:25.105 --> 01:15:39.934]  I think, again, like we saw with Geraldo Rivera, and like we saw with Bill Maher, there's going to have to continue, and the We Are Change people who do it everywhere, there has to continue to be a breakthrough into mainstream media of 9-11 truth.
[01:15:41.015 --> 01:15:46.699]  Again, it's become obvious that we're not going to have a top-down solution to this problem.
[01:15:46.819 --> 01:15:49.220]  You know, the censorship is coming from top-down.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.141]  It's not a bottom-up.
[01:15:50.848 --> 01:15:51.408]  Exactly.
[01:15:51.468 --> 01:15:55.890]  It's going to have to be grassroots, and that's the beauty of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:15:56.091 --> 01:15:58.992]  You know, people, it's a grassroots movement.
[01:15:59.112 --> 01:16:06.696]  People don't have to rely on anything else other than their fellow citizens who want to get to the bottom of this and find out the truth.
[01:16:06.756 --> 01:16:07.436]  Well, exactly.
[01:16:07.456 --> 01:16:08.697]  I have to use the football analogy.
[01:16:08.737 --> 01:16:09.297]  What's it called?
[01:16:09.317 --> 01:16:10.377]  What's the terms?
[01:16:10.417 --> 01:16:11.098]  I'll tip my tongue.
[01:16:11.498 --> 01:16:18.361]  Where the ball is moved by running, you know, just a foot at a time, a long battle down the whole field?
[01:16:18.981 --> 01:16:19.201]  Yes.
[01:16:20.462 --> 01:16:23.624]  Yeah, time of possession.
[01:16:24.845 --> 01:16:30.189]  You're going to eat up the clock.
[01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:31.330]  Fall possession.
[01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:32.171]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:32.631 --> 01:16:33.372]  That's what this is.
[01:16:33.392 --> 01:16:34.933]  We've gone like 80 yards.
[01:16:35.193 --> 01:16:36.374]  We've got 20 more to go.
[01:16:36.414 --> 01:16:37.454]  We've got a first down.
[01:16:37.675 --> 01:16:38.936]  We've had all these victories.
[01:16:39.856 --> 01:16:40.817]  Folks, we're winning.
[01:16:40.877 --> 01:16:41.938]  We can win this thing.
[01:16:43.533 --> 01:16:48.155]  Yeah, I think really people should again just concentrate on what they themselves can do.
[01:16:48.915 --> 01:16:50.415]  Don't feel powerless.
[01:16:50.555 --> 01:16:55.737]  Don't think like, you know, you have to accept these things even though you don't believe them.
[01:16:56.637 --> 01:17:01.799]  Every person has it in themselves to make a decision to do what is right.
[01:17:02.572 --> 01:17:03.112]  Absolutely.
[01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:03.953]  Let's take another call.
[01:17:03.973 --> 01:17:05.174]  I'm going to skip this break too.
[01:17:05.234 --> 01:17:10.057]  Just skip the music as well for the Infowars.com listeners and stations that choose to carry it.
[01:17:10.097 --> 01:17:10.838]  I'm skipping the break.
[01:17:11.598 --> 01:17:15.541]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next?
[01:17:15.801 --> 01:17:16.962]  Tim in North Carolina.
[01:17:17.002 --> 01:17:18.443]  You're on the air with Mark Stepnoski.
[01:17:20.144 --> 01:17:20.544]  Hey guys.
[01:17:20.924 --> 01:17:24.407]  It's interesting you came up with the football analogy there, Alex.
[01:17:24.867 --> 01:17:26.288]  That's exactly what I was thinking about.
[01:17:26.328 --> 01:17:27.189]  Mark, did you play defense?
[01:17:27.289 --> 01:17:28.610]  I played center.
[01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.990]  Hello?
[01:17:33.004 --> 01:17:34.145]  He played center.
[01:17:34.185 --> 01:17:35.346]  He was an offensive lineman.
[01:17:36.047 --> 01:17:36.687]  Offensive?
[01:17:36.727 --> 01:17:44.634]  Well, what I was thinking was, if you're playing defense, and that's what the 9-11 thing is all about, we're defending ourselves against those guys.
[01:17:45.034 --> 01:17:46.535]  You're trying to fool your opponent.
[01:17:46.976 --> 01:17:56.884]  And what I've been doing, is I've been taking your films, and Burma's films, and all of them, and relabeling them, and you rail on the
[01:17:58.033 --> 01:17:58.853]  We're good to go.
[01:18:22.576 --> 01:18:25.317]  Well, you're using the false left paradigm against them.
[01:18:25.357 --> 01:18:29.359]  I'm not going to say you're bad, but in my experience, it's best to not be deceptive.
[01:18:29.799 --> 01:18:32.961]  I would just say, this is a shocking film, very controversial.
[01:18:33.701 --> 01:18:35.502]  Ooh, these are hard to get, which is true.
[01:18:35.862 --> 01:18:37.183]  Tell me what you think about it.
[01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:41.404]  It's just so hard to get them to bite, though.
[01:18:41.504 --> 01:18:44.246]  When you do that, it's just so hard.
[01:18:44.266 --> 01:18:46.307]  Well, then tell them it's Jessica Simpson naked.
[01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:50.208]  Yeah, I mean, that's going off the deep end on it.
[01:18:50.388 --> 01:18:51.509]  No, I'm being sarcastic, yeah.
[01:18:52.273 --> 01:18:58.195]  You just have to get them to ask one question, just like you only have to get one safety out of line to score a touchdown.
[01:18:58.235 --> 01:19:02.136]  It's just that little, little inroad, right?
[01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:15.261]  Well, something I haven't done yet, because it is deceptive, but I'm really thinking about doing it, is you'll see something with 33 million views on YouTube, and it'll be a vitamin ad for 10 seconds with 20 seconds of a shot of some, you know,
[01:19:16.181 --> 01:19:17.342]  Not even their breasts showing.
[01:19:17.682 --> 01:19:19.943]  And I'm thinking, wait, to get the truth out, I might as well do that.
[01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:25.326]  I mean, because, anything to get the truth out, but it's a dangerous, slippery slope.
[01:19:25.606 --> 01:19:28.387]  That's kind of the mindset the military used to end up carrying out 9-11.
[01:19:28.767 --> 01:19:38.452]  Well, we lose troops as a pawn in war, why not go ahead and sacrifice 3,000 Americans so we can defeat the evil Muslims, which another brand of government ended up funding.
[01:19:38.492 --> 01:19:39.473]  Mark, your comments on that?
[01:19:41.005 --> 01:19:42.167]  That's a great point.
[01:19:43.289 --> 01:19:54.006]  Some of the guys who are actually responsible for 9-11, like Richard Myers and Ralph Eberhardt and Montague Whitfield, these generals at the Pentagon,
[01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:57.450]  These are the guys who escape public scrutiny.
[01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:03.634]  These are the guys behind the scenes who are running the war games, along with Dick Cheney and Dahl Rumsfeld.
[01:20:04.134 --> 01:20:12.259]  The guys that have everything going on that day to make that drill become live and to have it go through and have the desired effect.
[01:20:13.925 --> 01:20:15.566]  That's what we're dealing with right now.
[01:20:16.647 --> 01:20:22.171]  Again, you know, I just urge everybody, you know, people get caught up in the Republican-Democratic dialectic.
[01:20:22.211 --> 01:20:28.376]  You know, they don't remember that, you know, we have a one-party system masquerading as two parties.
[01:20:29.256 --> 01:20:32.519]  So I think people need to continue to look past that.
[01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:35.241]  Don't get caught up in the partisan politics.
[01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:41.011]  Realize that what's going on affects all of us, regardless of how we're going to vote in any given election.
[01:20:41.371 --> 01:20:42.672]  Absolutely, that's the key.
[01:20:42.712 --> 01:20:44.772]  Just look beyond and see the big picture.
[01:20:45.233 --> 01:20:45.773]  Absolutely.
[01:20:45.813 --> 01:20:48.254]  We're going to come back now and take a few final calls.
[01:20:48.334 --> 01:20:52.395]  Mark, we've got to do this more often than just once every 8, 9, 10 months.
[01:20:52.475 --> 01:20:58.518]  It's just been great having you here and I hope to sometime bump into you in person because I just really admire people with your type of courage.
[01:20:58.558 --> 01:20:58.938]  Here we go.
[01:21:04.394 --> 01:21:05.716]  It's an inside job, folks.
[01:21:05.776 --> 01:21:07.598]  Final segment with Mark Stepnowski.
[01:21:10.661 --> 01:21:15.868]  Marker, do you have a personal website or is there a site you want to plug or something you want to say here at the end?
[01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:20.613]  Well, again, I would just, you know, for those of
[01:21:21.849 --> 01:21:30.413]  Those of us in Canada, I would just like again to bring up the march that the 9-11 Truth Society of Vancouver has orchestrated.
[01:21:31.634 --> 01:21:39.418]  It's already began, it's going to culminate in Ottawa on September 15th, I believe today they're in Sudbury and Toronto, Ontario.
[01:21:40.198 --> 01:21:44.841]  These 9-11 truthers have been traveling across the country to get petitions.
[01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:50.444]  They're going to march from Montreal to Ottawa and arrive on September 11th.
[01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:58.958]  With all the signatures that they get nationwide on this petition, and this is for a new 9-11 investigation in Canada.
[01:21:58.978 --> 01:22:07.889]  Because what people forget is 9-11 was obviously portrayed as an attack against America, but it was a worldwide crime.
[01:22:10.611 --> 01:22:18.195]  And it totally freaks out the global controllers when we're out marching, when we don't shut up, when we don't stop.
[01:22:18.415 --> 01:22:19.596]  They tell us we don't have power.
[01:22:19.676 --> 01:22:20.616]  We know that's a lie.
[01:22:21.397 --> 01:22:24.018]  An enemy will always tell you you don't have a chance to win, folks.
[01:22:24.038 --> 01:22:25.359]  That's psychological warfare.
[01:22:25.419 --> 01:22:27.120]  We don't just have a chance.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.040]  We are going to win.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:28.961]  We are never going to stop.
[01:22:29.501 --> 01:22:30.462]  A couple final calls.
[01:22:30.582 --> 01:22:31.622]  Victor in Canada.
[01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:34.024]  Speaking of Canada, you're on the air with Mark Stepnowski.
[01:22:34.044 --> 01:22:34.344]  Go ahead.
[01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.670]  Hi there.
[01:22:36.271 --> 01:22:38.814]  Thanks, Mark, for everything you're doing, including plugging the March on Ottawa.
[01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:39.835]  I'm actually from Ottawa.
[01:22:40.636 --> 01:22:42.157]  I have a comment and a question.
[01:22:42.277 --> 01:22:46.222]  First, my question is, what advice do you have for closet celebrity truthers?
[01:22:48.304 --> 01:22:54.691]  I would tell them just to, instead of having a fear of the unknown, just come forward and speak the truth.
[01:22:54.771 --> 01:22:55.772]  Speak from your heart.
[01:22:56.627 --> 01:23:04.901]  You know, be honest with people, have facts to back up your point of view, and I really think that being the case, there's nothing for people to fear.
[01:23:05.041 --> 01:23:08.106]  Hey, think about Charlie Sheen, especially with his baggage.
[01:23:08.186 --> 01:23:09.428]  He was the first.
[01:23:10.049 --> 01:23:11.111]  Think about what he did.
[01:23:12.352 --> 01:23:14.653]  People appreciate someone who's willing to come forward.
[01:23:14.693 --> 01:23:20.636]  I think as time goes on, people are realizing how sanitized and censored mainstream media is.
[01:23:21.136 --> 01:23:32.161]  And whether somebody is a 9-11 truther who tells the truth, or a politician who's willing to give up the talking points and just, you know, speak truthfully, people appreciate that because it's so rare.
[01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:33.281]  Absolutely.
[01:23:33.981 --> 01:23:34.682]  Absolutely.
[01:23:34.922 --> 01:23:38.343]  That's what matters in this world is conviction and honor and duty and goodness.
[01:23:38.403 --> 01:23:40.723]  And Mark Sipnoski and many others have got it.
[01:23:40.743 --> 01:23:45.885]  And I just love to be part of this brotherhood, this sisterhood of man, of people that stand up and have courage.
[01:23:46.185 --> 01:23:47.945]  Real fast, Norman in North Carolina.
[01:23:47.965 --> 01:23:48.866]  You've got about 30 seconds.
[01:23:51.006 --> 01:23:51.807]  Hello, gentlemen.
[01:23:51.867 --> 01:23:52.967]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:23:53.367 --> 01:23:55.228]  And thank you for keeping the truth sacred.
[01:23:55.868 --> 01:24:00.369]  I believe that if the truth can be told so as to be understood, that it will be believed.
[01:24:00.954 --> 01:24:03.276]  And that's what you do so well, Alex, and I'm proud.
[01:24:03.596 --> 01:24:17.727]  I'm a proud InfoWarrior, working to wake up anyone with a pulse and an attention span, and it just, it gives me a true sense of purpose and a real feeling of patriotism, and I intuit that we have critical mass, and given that the news report is laughable,
[01:24:18.581 --> 01:24:21.023]  It's just a matter of time before we have resolutions.
[01:24:21.063 --> 01:24:22.705]  God bless you guys and thank you so much.
[01:24:23.005 --> 01:24:23.466]  Absolutely.
[01:24:23.486 --> 01:24:24.707]  Let me be clear here at the end.
[01:24:24.827 --> 01:24:26.669]  We reached critical mass years ago.
[01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:29.913]  In every major poll, the majority believe there's a cover-up.
[01:24:30.313 --> 01:24:32.896]  A huge portion of that majority believe inside job.
[01:24:33.196 --> 01:24:35.178]  And those are in polls when they're calling somebody up.
[01:24:35.238 --> 01:24:37.320]  And folks usually don't answer controversially.
[01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:39.122]  We've reached critical mass.
[01:24:39.443 --> 01:24:42.526]  People just don't realize that the majority of us know the truth and we're scared.
[01:24:42.826 --> 01:24:48.391]  People like Mark Stepnoski stepping up to the plate, that lets people see the courage and lets them know that we're not alone.
[01:24:48.692 --> 01:24:49.893]  In fact, that we're the majority.
[01:24:50.293 --> 01:24:53.056]  And so now we've just got to take back control of our government.
[01:24:53.336 --> 01:24:54.257]  We are the majority.
[01:24:54.558 --> 01:24:57.060]  Mark Stepnoski, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.784]  I want to say bye to you on the show ends here in about 30 seconds, but anything else you want to add?
[01:25:01.983 --> 01:25:04.304]  Well, I just want to say it's been nice being with you.
[01:25:04.404 --> 01:25:06.325]  Thanks again for the opportunity to come on.
[01:25:06.345 --> 01:25:07.106]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:07.626 --> 01:25:08.366]  I appreciate you.
[01:25:08.406 --> 01:25:09.867]  Stay right there, my friend, for 20 seconds.
[01:25:09.887 --> 01:25:13.129]  I'm going to be right there at the end to talk to you for a second, say bye to you personally.
