[00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:19.642]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:21.444]  Build Back Better.
[00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:30.076]  That is the official Davos Group slash UN slogan for collapsing the world economy, turning it off, and then forcing you on to the new green economy.
[00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.052]  That is going to be a particular focus of the Build Back Better agenda.
[00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:37.932]  Klaus Schwab has made many statements.
[00:00:37.952 --> 00:00:40.753]  He's written a book saying that, oh, COVID-19 is not really a threat.
[00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:45.835]  We're using it as a pretext to bring in the new economy that they own and they control.
[00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:47.215]  They claim it's for the environment.
[00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:54.898]  No, it's about consolidating control, starving the third world, and then flooding the first world with those giant migrant waves that are already surging.
[00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:55.902]  Sorry.
[00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:56.042]  Sorry.
[00:01:11.618 --> 00:01:28.239]  You can't have a XL pipeline job, Keystone pipeline job, you can't have a oil field job, you can't have an actual gas job, you can't have a coal job, you can't have any job basically that's involved with fossil fuels because we're banning that.
[00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.522]  And India, they're not banning it.
[00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:33.103]  They're all open for business.
[00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:33.843]  So is Mexico.
[00:01:34.023 --> 00:01:35.504]  They're not signing on to the climate accords.
[00:01:35.684 --> 00:01:38.066]  They're not cutting any of their industrial output.
[00:01:38.646 --> 00:01:41.788]  Only Europe, only the U.S., only Canada, only Australia and New Zealand.
[00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:48.332]  This is literally a tax on the first world, the globalists have invested in China and the third world, and then all the jobs move there.
[00:01:48.552 --> 00:01:53.975]  That's why when Trump came in and took the restrictions off, it's like it turned the economy back on like flipping a light switch.
[00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.778]  So there he is saying, build back better, and, oh, I'm sorry, why don't you go get a job building solar panels or being a technician on them?
[00:02:01.938 --> 00:02:09.048]  Those folks have better choices, that they have alternatives, that they can be the people who go to work to make the solar panels.
[00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:15.536]  If we know anything about that, it's very regulated, very, very controlled on who gets that money.
[00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:22.322]  It's another boondoggle giving hundreds of billions of dollars to select globalist corporations and, of course, Communist China.
[00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:25.644]  It is fossil fuel that decentralizes power.
[00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:27.266]  Take electric cars.
[00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:28.988]  They're built of fossil fuel.
[00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:29.909]  They're mainly plastic.
[00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:37.797]  And then you have these big power plants that are either natural gas, hydroelectric, or coal that then have to transfer the power down the power lines.
[00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:41.000]  So when you see on the side of these that has zero emissions, that's a lot.
[00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:47.688]  On average, an electric car running off of power from a power plant uses more fossil fuels
[00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:48.949]  Thank you!
[00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:15.312]  Windmills that they spent tens of billions of dollars on, that Boone Pickens was involved in the scam, up to 90% of the energy is lost by the time it hits Austin, Texas, its main stomp to be distributed across the state.
[00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:18.213]  90% of the power is lost.
[00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:19.574]  Do you understand what I just said?
[00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:22.596]  90% of the power is lost.
[00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:24.257]  Am I for solar and new technology?
[00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:24.757]  Absolutely.
[00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:26.198]  If it's in your backyard,
[00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:31.295]  If it's on your house, if it isn't hooked into the grid, but all the rest of it is a boondoggle and a scam.
[00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:35.636]  But here is this monster telling Americans, oh, basically learn to code.
[00:03:35.976 --> 00:03:37.597]  Hey, go build some solar panels.
[00:03:37.757 --> 00:03:38.477]  Oh, yeah, right.
[00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:39.518]  It's incredible.
[00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.559]  The truth is, it's like a science fiction movie.
[00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.360]  They say that Bill Gates has been secretly terraforming the earth for over 20 years.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.941]  They now declassified it last year.
[00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:50.862]  Five years ago, the CIA director admitted to a lot of it.
[00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:54.703]  And they say they're blocking sunlight to create a new ice age.
[00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:59.166]  But they actually study the Earth's history from ice cores and mud samples that they've done.
[00:03:59.226 --> 00:03:59.726]  Look this up.
[00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:04.029]  There used to be much higher carbon dioxide and much higher oxygen on Earth.
[00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.630]  Now they're just barely traces.
[00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.874]  And they think that humans and other animals and plants have just basically evolved to deal with it.
[00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:18.359]  But that's why dinosaurs used to be so big, trees used to grow so much bigger, so much healthier, was because it was a lot more carbon dioxide and a lot more oxygen.
[00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.460]  That's why all of Africa used to be green.
[00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:25.455]  The reason the Sahara Desert is expanding, scientists know this, is because of lower carbon dioxide.
[00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:30.677]  So it's crazy that just about 140 years ago, the Rockefellers discovered oil.
[00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:33.378]  Well, they first found it in Germany, but they learned how to exploit it.
[00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:35.039]  You know, give them their credit.
[00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:43.004]  And then suddenly they terraform all of this locked up carbon that the earth had produced back when we had more carbon.
[00:04:43.604 --> 00:04:44.745]  Now it's locked up in the earth.
[00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:47.207]  They bring it up and the earth starts re-greening.
[00:04:47.847 --> 00:04:48.728]  That's been confirmed.
[00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.229]  So it's crazy.
[00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:59.715]  They're trying to terraform artificially by adding aluminum dioxide and barium salts to jet fuel to create nuclei and cause these artificial clouds to block solar radiation.
[00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:02.157]  But meanwhile our own discovery of oil
[00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:03.711]  We're good to go.
[00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:21.256]  That's right.
[00:05:42.444 --> 00:05:43.324]  That are for me.
[00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:54.407]  I think of everybody, and I think about the reality of what's going on, but you talk about coal-blooded folks cutting off our coal, cutting off our oil, not having any new leases given out for oil drilling.
[00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:56.748]  This is insane.
[00:05:56.828 --> 00:05:58.168]  On over 60% of the U.S.
[00:05:58.248 --> 00:06:00.449]  soil, we can't compete like this.
[00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:01.629]  We're not open for business.
[00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:07.630]  And so, remember, Build Back Better is about bankrupting the economy, saying you're not essential, shutting down small businesses.
[00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.391]  So if we're going to put up with shutting down coal and oil, well, you're not essential too.
[00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:17.092]  And that's what these big megacorporations, the big banks, the big financiers he talks about in the clips that are going to save us.
[00:06:18.432 --> 00:06:22.833]  And, you know, he's also up there explaining how, oh, it actually creates a real economy to do this.
[00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.333]  All of this is a lie.
[00:06:24.353 --> 00:06:27.833]  If you actually read what the globalists say, they want to make you poor, they want to control you.
[00:06:27.873 --> 00:06:31.094]  So that is the reality.
[00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:33.429]  You cannot debate the facts.
[00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:34.271]  Look them up yourself.
[00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:35.193]  That is the real science.
[00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:38.463]  They just hope you don't look at the science and go, oh, I'm against those big oil companies.
[00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:41.887]  The big oil companies are all funding the carbon tax right now.
[00:06:42.187 --> 00:06:43.187]  It's about global government.
[00:06:43.207 --> 00:06:44.788]  They don't even care about resources anymore.
[00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.451]  It's about control of you and micromanaging every aspect of your life.
[00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:51.953]  And that's why they're censoring people that question the carbon taxes.
[00:06:51.973 --> 00:06:54.235]  They're censoring people that question COVID as an overblown hoax.
[00:06:54.475 --> 00:06:56.256]  They're censoring folks that question election fraud.
[00:06:56.696 --> 00:06:58.377]  Even if I'm wrong about election fraud, which I'm not.
[00:06:58.738 --> 00:06:59.998]  Or the carbon tax being a fraud.
[00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.800]  Or the COVID vaccine not working and being dangerous.
[00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:04.601]  I have a right to say that, don't I?
[00:07:05.002 --> 00:07:06.783]  But oh no, we can't allow that.
[00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:08.104]  This is so dangerous.
[00:07:08.704 --> 00:07:10.426]  Please continue to support Bandot Video.
[00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.448]  Please continue to share these videos with others.
[00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:17.153]  And I'll read what you have to say in the comments below, probably on the radio tomorrow, because this is a big issue.
[00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:22.618]  We should probably open the phones up and talk to Americans that work in the energy sector and talk about discrimination.
[00:07:22.658 --> 00:07:27.503]  You're being told you're obsolete, but Saudi Arabia isn't, China isn't, Mexico isn't.
[00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:29.825]  160 plus countries aren't signed on to this.
[00:07:30.646 --> 00:07:32.147]  We didn't ask to be signed on to this.
[00:07:32.207 --> 00:07:38.912]  They stole an election to install their globalist puppet who just signed an executive order banning the term China virus.
[00:07:39.272 --> 00:07:40.253]  Go to hell, Biden.
[00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:44.916]  I have to have my own website now, banned.video, just to say China virus.
[00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:47.798]  If you say it on YouTube now, they take you down.
[00:07:47.818 --> 00:07:49.279]  All right.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.461]  It's up to you now, folks.
[00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:53.142]  You see this elitist John Kerry.
[00:07:53.182 --> 00:07:54.103]  He doesn't care about you.
[00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:55.424]  He wants to control your energy.
[00:07:55.664 --> 00:07:56.925]  He wants to keep you locked up in your house.
[00:07:57.193 --> 00:07:57.833]  They have a name for it.
[00:07:57.853 --> 00:07:58.614]  It's called siege.
[00:07:59.054 --> 00:07:59.974]  It's called slavery.
[00:08:00.174 --> 00:08:03.296]  And it's time to say we're awake and we're not submitting to you anymore.
[00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:13.500]  It's a very pertinent question to ask how do we build back better?
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.821]  To build back better or whatever.
[00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:20.083]  We have a chance to reset the clock and build back better than before.
[00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:22.620]  To build back better than before.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:29.362]  Remember the terrible damage of COVID as we try to build back from this global pandemic.
[00:08:29.582 --> 00:08:31.763]  Joe Biden calls it build back better.
[00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.543]  Build back better.
[00:08:34.684 --> 00:08:35.664]  Building back better.
[00:08:36.184 --> 00:08:37.625]  To do things differently.
[00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:39.985]  To build back better.
[00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.906]  We're going to build it back better.
[00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:44.567]  And build it back better.
[00:08:45.947 --> 00:08:48.008]  My plan to build back better.
[00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:57.522]  Start taking all the problems that have been created in education and mental health and start to build back in a positive way.
[00:08:58.002 --> 00:09:01.944]  I have launched a booklet called Build Back Better.
[00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:03.924]  Britain after coronavirus.
[00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:09.147]  It's about building this country back better.
[00:09:09.707 --> 00:09:11.588]  Growing conspiracy following it.
[00:09:12.048 --> 00:09:13.909]  It is called The Great Reset.
[00:09:14.861 --> 00:09:20.466]  Unprecedented opportunity to rethink and reset the ways in which we live.
[00:09:20.766 --> 00:09:23.368]  The great opportunity for reset.
[00:09:23.849 --> 00:09:30.594]  The theory even calls Mr. Biden's campaign slogan, Build Back Better, a front for the conspiracy.
[00:09:31.315 --> 00:09:32.296]  Build back better.
[00:09:32.936 --> 00:09:35.058]  Building back better our economy.
[00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:38.161]  Build back better.
[00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:44.302]  All elements of the Great Reset are fundamental to building the future we need.
[00:09:45.023 --> 00:09:48.564]  This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.
[00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.065]  It's a big effort.
[00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:55.886]  Some would say to build back better.
[00:09:56.286 --> 00:10:00.067]  We would say to really have a great reset.
[00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:01.127]  Conspiracy.
[00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:02.047]  Conspiracy.
[00:10:02.207 --> 00:10:03.368]  Conspiracy.
[00:10:08.698 --> 00:10:09.980]  Thank you all for your time.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:16.891]  Sir, what sacrifices are you asking Americans to make?
[00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:19.075]  Sir, I want to call on Bernie.
[00:10:19.095 --> 00:10:20.397]  Do you still support the impeachment process?
