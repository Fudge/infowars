[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  [outro]
[00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:14.337]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.280]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.280]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.280]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.280]   While George Soros has riddled the American justice system with open society
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280]  funded district attorney anarchy.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   There's almost no reform you want that prosecutors couldn't implement today
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.280]  using their own discretion.
[00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:49.043]  If you want bail reform, then prosecutors can simply stop asking for bail.
[00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:53.104]  More than $340,000 in merchandise stolen in L.A.
[00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:54.165]  smash-and-grab thefts.
[00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:57.986]  Fourteen arrested, but have bailed out or met the no-bail criteria.
[00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.287]  And LAPD Chief Moore couldn't hide his frustration.
[00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:18.319]  You could be arrested for a crime such as burglary, serious felony, a person coming into your home or business during hours of darkness or otherwise, and that that's a zero bail, meaning that we book and process identify you, and then your arraignment date is three to four months from now.
[00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:27.746]  Klaus Schwab trained and strategically placed the minions of the Great Reset Cancer within the policy machine of democracies worldwide.
[00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:52.856]  It's really an incredible opportunity to join a community of 800 leaders from over 80 countries all over the world who work in a number of different situations, whether it's in the news or in the media or with large corporates or entrepreneurs and startups who focus on public policy, but really going a lot deeper, understanding the key issues that plague society today, the real potential for reform.
[00:01:53.596 --> 00:02:01.003]  The World Economic Forum's Young Global Leaders Program graduates include, among them, French President Emmanuel Macron.
[00:02:01.023 --> 00:02:11.654]  The economy of tomorrow is going to have to be an economy that thinks about innovation and humanity, and it's going to have to build competitiveness.
[00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:35.336]  With the climate challenge, reducing CO2 emissions, adapting our societies, the biodiversity agenda, so it's an economy that will have to be more resilient, that will be better organized, and will have to be including these elements of resistance in the supply chains.
[00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:38.879]   New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern That's why I've said this.
[00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.400]  There's not going to be an end point to this vaccination program.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.241]  And U.S.
[00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.122]  Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.
[00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:46.663]  I think that shows a lot of promise.
[00:02:46.743 --> 00:02:53.027]  If we believe in that so-called user pays principle, the idea that part of how we pay for roads is you pay based on how much you drive.
[00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:55.509]  The gas tax used to be the obvious way to do it.
[00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:56.429]  It's not anymore.
[00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:01.873]  So a so-called vehicle miles traveled tax or mileage tax, whatever you want to call it, could be a way to do it.
[00:03:02.313 --> 00:03:04.895]  This tax would be on top of what you already pay.
[00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:11.821]  Plus, you know, for every Joe bag of donuts that wants to take a road trip across America, they're now paying for that road trip.
[00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:14.544]  Does this pay for the infrastructure?
[00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:18.247]  And how is this fair for someone in your line of work?
[00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:19.608]  I don't think it's fair at all.
[00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:22.351]  I mean, we're the ones out here delivering goods and supplying America.
[00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:24.873]  Like I said, we pay enough tax already.
[00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.975]  Thousands of dollars a year per truck.
[00:03:27.515 --> 00:03:36.862]  All of them implementing the directives of the Great Reset over the legislative will of their populace and their respective constitutional frameworks.
[00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:44.448]  I think there's this debate going on right now, raging over whether you can be both patriotic and a global citizen.
[00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:55.397]  So yes, I believe that you can be both proud of who you are and where you're from, but some of that pride can come from what you do as an international citizen.
[00:03:55.717 --> 00:04:12.422]  Klaus Schwab's Young Global Leaders Mission Statement reads, Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, created the Forum of Young Global Leaders in 2004 to help the world meet increasingly complex and interdependent problems.
[00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:24.945]  His vision was to create a proactive multi-stakeholder community of the world's next-generation leaders to inform and influence decision-making and mobilize transformation.
[00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:51.606]  Whether anyone asked for it or not, Schwab's megalomaniacal Fourth Industrial Revolution nightmarish vision is well underway, inhabiting positions within the democracies that were once duly elected seats of power, undermining national sovereignty and the future of individual freedom, a quiet declaration of war carried out by the infiltration of his forum of young global leaders.
[00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:53.227]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:54.754]  Folks, we're live.
[00:04:54.574 --> 00:04:56.574]  get ready for one hell of a transmission.
[00:04:56.574 --> 00:05:05.574]  It's Sunday, December 12th.
[00:05:05.897 --> 00:05:06.637]  The year is 2021.
[00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:13.359]  And we're always covering huge, epic, frontline information.
[00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:22.601]  But today, there has just been a crescendo, a cascade, a landslide of truth against our enemies.
[00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:36.514]  We have had victory after victory after victory in the last week against their race crime hoaxes, against their poison injections, against their pedophile rings, and so much more.
[00:05:37.714 --> 00:05:45.239]  Again, thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.362]  We're going to destroy the whole COVID-19 martial law medical attorney takeover.
[00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:52.903]  That's coming up next hour.
[00:05:56.653 --> 00:06:08.784]  We're going to get to the latest coming up at the bottom of the hour on Biden blaming tornadoes that have always hit states and always caused carnage at this level.
[00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:09.885]  Hundreds of times.
[00:06:09.905 --> 00:06:10.585]  It's still terrible.
[00:06:11.526 --> 00:06:16.150]  And blaming it on global warming, which again, they admit now is a global warming.
[00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.732]  It's just climate change.
[00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:30.699]  And notice, when we talk about government weather systems that don't completely control the weather, but they admit can cause floods, cause tornadoes, cause hurricanes, cause... I mean, that was certified, declassified in the late 90s by the Pentagon.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:40.326]  They go, oh no, that doesn't exist, even though it does, but then they blame you and your car, or a coal mine for what happened, with no proof.
[00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:44.089]  Whereas we actually have weather weapon programs and things going on.
[00:06:45.017 --> 00:06:50.919]  So we'll hear from the former director of the CIA admitting they have weather weapons coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:51.359 --> 00:07:05.605]  But before I hit all of that, ladies and gentlemen, you talk about the wheels coming off the globalist operation, you talk about the engine blowing up, you talk about the house burning down.
[00:07:06.905 --> 00:07:11.347]  The globalists know their corrupt system is coming to an end.
[00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:24.238]  And they're trying to take capitalism with it, when it's not capitalism that caused this, but crony capitalism and corrupt financiers working with authoritarian regimes to create monopolies.
[00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:32.021]  So they know their monopolistic New World Order, Great Reset is coming to an end.
[00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:33.842]  They understand that.
[00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.371]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:54.441]  And so they're going to engineer an artificial collapse so they can be the saviors of the collapse, so they have all the PR straight and all the propaganda straight, so that as things disintegrate, they can pose as the saviors and hopefully stay in charge of this controlled demolition that they have executed.
[00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:57.823]  But it's not going the way tyrants always want it to go.
[00:07:58.123 --> 00:07:59.204]  It's getting out of control.
[00:07:59.484 --> 00:08:01.345]  So they're upping the level of control.
[00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:03.226]  They're accelerating the collapse.
[00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:06.753]  And they basically lost control now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:14.320]  Only a mass awakening of the public can get control of the train before it goes over the edge into the ravine.
[00:08:15.941 --> 00:08:27.276]   And we're very close to that point where we're at a point of return, but the masses having a giant epiphany, a giant chain reaction awakening can And we'll stop them.
[00:08:27.577 --> 00:08:34.459]  That's why they want this show, just as much as they wanted Trump destroyed, because he was a populist, actually cared about the country, and actually wanted us to be sovereign.
[00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:37.380]  He had his own problems, but he believed the president should be president.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.760]  He wasn't out to get the country.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.041]  That's why the globalists hated him so much.
[00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:43.282]  Well, they hate us even more.
[00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:44.662]  That means all of you, not just me.
[00:08:44.702 --> 00:08:45.962]  I'm just a focal point of this.
[00:08:46.543 --> 00:08:53.845]  Because you have the solutions to stop what they're doing, and you understand their program and their operation.
[00:08:55.905 --> 00:08:59.307]  Now, we could do a drumroll here, but this is actually very sad and disgusting.
[00:09:00.267 --> 00:09:06.250]  And I've explained this and I've told you that the majority of the high-level producers at CNN are pedophiles.
[00:09:07.432 --> 00:09:09.274]  And I don't just get up here and say that for no reason.
[00:09:09.854 --> 00:09:14.739]  That's how these intelligence, private corporate intelligence operations of Jeffrey Epstein and others work.
[00:09:15.079 --> 00:09:27.451]  Why do you think Jeffrey Epstein was recruiting hundreds of girls a month in Palm Beach alone, industrial level, having to exhaust himself, having sex with up to five young girls a day?
[00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:53.649]  Because they had so many men they wanted to corrupt, so many men ready to sell out, from police chiefs, to judges, to lawyers, to bankers, to academics, to scientists, that in one area of Florida, he had thousands and thousands of girls as young as 11 years old, just in the introductory level of the corruption, and then even younger for the real sickos.
[00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.190]  The real demons.
[00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.572]  As if the ones having sex with 15 year olds weren't evil enough.
[00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:03.213]  So this is the out-of-control corruption of the forbidden fruit of that.
[00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:08.276]  And so, you see another.
[00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:09.277]  How many have there been?
[00:10:09.297 --> 00:10:17.162]  CNN, high-level head Cuomo, Chris Cuomo.
[00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:27.489]  I mean, you don't think they just got rid of Cuomo because of his brother, or because when he's their top show, or because a woman might say he sexually harassed him.
[00:10:27.569 --> 00:10:28.410]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:32.884]  I mean, his brother wears nipple rings on television.
[00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:34.045]  These are some freaks.
[00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:52.011]  And so, now it comes out that this head producer for Chris Cuomo was organizing women bringing their daughters to him so that he would have sex with the mother and the daughter.
[00:10:52.432 --> 00:10:53.172]  And what did I tell you?
[00:10:53.232 --> 00:10:55.693]  These people want to get their kids into this cult.
[00:10:57.369 --> 00:11:02.751]  These mothers want to get assigned into the operation so their daughters can now recruit other women.
[00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:08.172]  Just like you want to get into Harvard, or you want to get into Yale, or you want to get into UT or wherever.
[00:11:08.472 --> 00:11:13.754]  Well, in the world today, you try to get in at CNN.
[00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:21.956]  The majority of the people at the top now, you wonder why they're so evil, why they follow orders.
[00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:24.757]  Because they've been given, they think, get out of jail free cards.
[00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:29.965]  And so that's who they are.
[00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:30.966]  That's what they're into.
[00:11:31.286 --> 00:11:32.246]  That's what they want.
[00:11:32.446 --> 00:11:37.169]  They don't want to go eat a steak and drink a glass of wine and look at the sunset and every time it's just as good or better.
[00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.690]  They don't want their wife.
[00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:40.511]  They want to screw little kids.
[00:11:40.772 --> 00:11:50.037]  And this guy has been indicted for raping a nine-year-old, reportedly, in front of the mother that brought the child there to be raped.
[00:11:52.519 --> 00:12:05.212]   Now, right as this comes out, the Atlantic Monthly, Owned by the heiress of Apple, who hung out on Epstein Island, we'll show you photos and flight logs in a moment, said there's no such thing as pedophilia.
[00:12:05.232 --> 00:12:09.194]  Now why the hell would you put something out like that?
[00:12:09.214 --> 00:12:10.274]  I'm going to show it to you in a moment.
[00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:12.675]  Why would you do that?
[00:12:12.695 --> 00:12:14.376]  Because that's gaslighting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:16.256 --> 00:12:17.617]  And I've got other articles all over it.
[00:12:17.677 --> 00:12:18.997]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times.
[00:12:19.617 --> 00:12:19.678]  Oh!
[00:12:19.698 --> 00:12:19.738]  Oh!
[00:12:22.369 --> 00:12:27.573]  Remember the pizza gate where the internet said maybe something's happening in the basement of a pizza place, which it wasn't.
[00:12:27.933 --> 00:12:28.734]  There was no basement.
[00:12:28.954 --> 00:12:30.715]  And so now there's no pedophilia on earth.
[00:12:30.955 --> 00:12:31.616]  It doesn't exist.
[00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:32.496]  You know that's a fraud.
[00:12:32.797 --> 00:12:33.877]  That's an attempt at a straw man.
[00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:34.518]  It doesn't work.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.542]  So why are all these organizations and groups doing this?
[00:12:39.582 --> 00:12:43.805]  And I'll tell you again, because yeah, there's the heiress.
[00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:47.487]  She's worth like $50 million to Apple.
[00:12:47.507 --> 00:12:48.128]  She owns Apple.
[00:12:48.902 --> 00:12:50.063]  The controlling stock.
[00:12:50.463 --> 00:12:56.988]  And she literally basically just lived with the Epsteins in New York, in Paris, in London, and at Little St.
[00:12:57.028 --> 00:12:57.348]  John's.
[00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.892]  So that's who these people are.
[00:13:01.952 --> 00:13:05.335]  It's about their power, their control, their God.
[00:13:05.775 --> 00:13:10.178]  They can do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:18.925]   And I tell you, just like that woman ended up in prison, The Apple heiress needs to be heavily investigated.
[00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:21.046]  And she thinks she can fund these attacks on us?
[00:13:22.006 --> 00:13:24.888]  I am proud to have her and George Soros as my enemies.
[00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:31.030]  Not looking to get killed or put in prison, but if I gotta do this to stop what you're doing, then do it!
[00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.830]  Feel your hand.
[00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:35.692]  Because there's no backing down here, because I'm not with you.
[00:13:36.032 --> 00:13:42.175]  And if I submit to you, and if I back down to you, then you have made me join your ranks.
[00:13:42.315 --> 00:13:45.036]  And death is a wonderful release.
[00:13:46.195 --> 00:13:54.301]  At your filthy hands, or your minions' hands, compared to facing God and being a coward working with you.
[00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:55.081]  I will never do it.
[00:13:56.422 --> 00:13:57.483]  And the reckoning's coming.
[00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:04.268]  So you try to collapse society, you try to poison us with these shots, you pull all your crap, you attack us with everything you got, but it's coming out.
[00:14:04.368 --> 00:14:19.761]   So, rats leaving the sinking ship, you've got All these different globalists, like Brian Williams, leading and leaving MSNBC.
[00:14:20.622 --> 00:14:30.104]  You've got, about to be fired, Chris Wallace, when his contract's up, acting like he quit in face-saving measure, running to do an internet show on the failing sinking ship of CNN.
[00:14:30.784 --> 00:14:32.844]  You've got all of this coming out.
[00:14:32.884 --> 00:14:35.005]  We'll tell you the rest of the story, straight ahead.
[00:14:39.405 --> 00:14:41.546]  There is no honor amongst thieves.
[00:14:42.817 --> 00:14:52.195]  And Hollywood has been a giant private corporate intelligence operation of MI6, the CIA, and the Mossad.
[00:14:55.117 --> 00:15:04.204]  Setting up cults, setting up front groups to go out and then run intelligence operations on companies and corporations to basically take over society.
[00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:13.651]  Then you demoralize the general public to break up our families and weaken us ahead of our total enslavement by the big central banks who then want to depopulate us.
[00:15:15.152 --> 00:15:18.415]  So this has all been a Carnegie Rockefeller endowment operation.
[00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:19.176]  You now see it.
[00:15:19.316 --> 00:15:22.138]  Studying their own documents is how I know the future way out ahead of time.
[00:15:23.971 --> 00:15:32.750]  That's why you constantly see like a head of Homeland Security in a whole region, how many times, caught having a mother flying in with a three-year-old to have sex with them.
[00:15:33.412 --> 00:15:33.813]  To rape them.
[00:15:35.461 --> 00:15:36.362]  You're like, what's going on?
[00:15:36.442 --> 00:15:42.247]  Well, that's just because somebody good finally found out about it, and a group of law enforcement they don't control busted them.
[00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:45.590]  That's why they have the left taking over law enforcement.
[00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:57.821]  That's why George Soros is putting in the district attorneys and the attorney generals at the state level, and why the left is trying to pack the whole FBI and the federal marshals with their people, and they're very close to winning.
[00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:06.111]  But as they know the news comes out, that's why Nickelodeon and all the channels promote pedophilia and now say it's actually okay.
[00:16:08.373 --> 00:16:10.656]  Inoculating your child without your consent's okay.
[00:16:10.957 --> 00:16:15.182]  It's all about getting rid of the age of consent.
[00:16:15.222 --> 00:16:16.364]  But it's not just about blackmail.
[00:16:17.914 --> 00:16:18.855]  It's about the control.
[00:16:18.955 --> 00:16:30.040]  So DOJ says CNN producer raped nine-year-old while her mother watched solicitor girls 9 to 16 for sex virtual training sessions with their parents.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.441]  He was a Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:16:32.821 --> 00:16:33.782]  He was recruiting.
[00:16:34.102 --> 00:16:39.925]  He was preparing his sex slave ops because that's how you get into the upper ranks of the system.
[00:16:40.445 --> 00:16:42.206]  Here's a photo of him for TV viewers.
[00:16:43.206 --> 00:16:49.398]   Here is Chris Cuomo and the CNN senior producer Who were just arrested for raping children.
[00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:52.700]  And believe me, what we know about is horrible.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.841]  You can be assured it's bigger than Sandusky.
[00:16:56.202 --> 00:17:00.364]  CNN is a intelligence operation of the highest order.
[00:17:04.085 --> 00:17:06.186]  Absolutely disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:06.226 --> 00:17:06.907]  Look at this guy.
[00:17:06.927 --> 00:17:08.448]  I mean, just look at what a predator he is.
[00:17:08.468 --> 00:17:10.529]  I mean, would you let that person anywhere near your children?
[00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:11.869]  You look at them and say, absolutely not.
[00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:13.170]  But you have discernment, see?
[00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:17.008]  The general public that's held under this satanic spell doesn't.
[00:17:17.768 --> 00:17:17.848]  Ugh.
[00:17:17.948 --> 00:17:21.090]  He doesn't just want to rape your children, though.
[00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.572]  He wants to rape your mind and your freedom and your body with the GMO death shots.
[00:17:26.873 --> 00:17:28.353]  CNN producer arrested.
[00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:30.854]  Accused of raping children as young as nine.
[00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:33.696]  Chris Cuomo's producer.
[00:17:35.342 --> 00:17:36.362]  Look at that maniac.
[00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:38.463]  He's in the club, he thought.
[00:17:38.983 --> 00:17:42.343]  Chris Cuomo, CNN producer, charged with luring girls for sexual training.
[00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:43.423]  That's the New York Post.
[00:17:43.483 --> 00:17:45.144]  No, it's a lot worse than that.
[00:17:45.284 --> 00:17:46.504]  Oh, but here's CNN.
[00:17:47.764 --> 00:17:51.345]  A baseless conspiracy theory found a foothold in Europe.
[00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:52.305]  New research shows.
[00:17:52.665 --> 00:17:53.845]  CNN article text me.
[00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:58.186]  There's no government or combines of pedophiles running secret networks.
[00:17:58.326 --> 00:18:01.786]  No, they put this out on CNN during the whole Epstein thing last year.
[00:18:03.127 --> 00:18:03.467]  Oh, no.
[00:18:03.507 --> 00:18:04.527]  Oh, but oh, it gets better.
[00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:09.551]  Of all the words of tongue and pen, the truest are these.
[00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:10.831]  Alex Jones was right again.
[00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:12.972]  Jack Posobiec puts it out, it's confirmed.
[00:18:13.312 --> 00:18:29.981]  Queen of England there at the cabin, shame cabin, with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who are best friends with the royal house, helping frame and keep everybody under control with sex ops, which her father ran for MI6, and of course, OSS before that in World War II.
[00:18:30.321 --> 00:18:32.742]  Ghislaine Maxwell, the spymaster sex operative.
[00:18:33.702 --> 00:18:38.506]   That's why Jeffrey Epstein You had to recruit hundreds of girls a week just in Palm
[00:18:38.506 --> 00:18:42.216]   Beach to supply all the people that they were, who were willingly coming and getting
[00:18:42.216 --> 00:18:42.705]  framed.
[00:18:42.705 --> 00:18:45.826]  They wanted to be in the club.
[00:18:45.826 --> 00:18:48.906]  Who else was in the club?
[00:18:48.906 --> 00:18:53.186]   Alex Jones is basically right that America is run by evil people who want to molest your
[00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:57.505]  kids and kill or imprison you if you try to stop them.
[00:18:57.505 --> 00:19:04.465]   Lawrence Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs' widow, and Gisling Maxwell having fun at the little pervert
[00:19:04.465 --> 00:19:10.065]   island and then the Atlantic that she owns running the headline, "The Great Fake Child
[00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.625]  Sex Trafficking Epidemic."
[00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:12.159]  Ha!
[00:19:12.499 --> 00:19:15.601]  The Senate report confirms thousands of children trafficked across the U.S.
[00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:19.463]  border under Obama, who then authorized it, given into sex slavery.
[00:19:19.523 --> 00:19:21.284]  Many were disappeared or killed.
[00:19:21.304 --> 00:19:22.765]  That's a U.S.
[00:19:22.805 --> 00:19:27.005]   Senate report confirms children trafficked across border under Obama
[00:19:27.005 --> 00:19:34.685]   were used in sex traffic. But it's okay that the Senate report confirms
[00:19:34.685 --> 00:19:39.765]   thousands of children that Obama allowed to be smuggled and brought in were sex
[00:19:39.765 --> 00:19:45.605]   trafficked because The Atlantic, the most evil publication in the world, literally
[00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:48.220]  I mean, she spends billions a year attacking us.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.601]  Attacking free speech.
[00:19:49.661 --> 00:19:50.621]  Attacking America.
[00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:53.503]  And then, she's, but it's okay, because she's a woman.
[00:19:53.803 --> 00:19:55.504]  You see, so she's allowed to act like this.
[00:19:55.884 --> 00:19:58.646]  She's, you know, and oh, they had a Twitter that censors everybody.
[00:19:58.886 --> 00:20:00.787]  He's got brown skin, so it's okay too, right?
[00:20:04.129 --> 00:20:08.111]  CNN staff are charged with enticing moms, young daughters into sexual activity.
[00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:10.472]  Quote, training them for missions.
[00:20:11.193 --> 00:20:12.213]  Said, I'm gonna train you.
[00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:13.674]  I'm gonna make you a secret agent.
[00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:15.256]  Yeah, that's all coming out.
[00:20:17.457 --> 00:20:18.918]  And the women wanted to be recruited.
[00:20:19.198 --> 00:20:21.499]  Oh my gosh, secret agent, man.
[00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:24.721]  You know, James Bond isn't having sex with hot chicks up in hotel rooms.
[00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:28.964]  James Bond's got lines of old men coming in to screw ten-year-old girls.
[00:20:29.824 --> 00:20:30.845]  That's what James Bond does.
[00:20:32.766 --> 00:20:34.607]  And hey, they're externalizing the method.
[00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:36.268]  Roger Stone's gonna pop on.
[00:20:36.308 --> 00:20:40.130]  He's about to get on a plane, but he's gonna pop on, start of the next hour.
[00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.800]   SNL jokes about Gang raping Roger Stone's 75-year-old wife who has cancer.
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.101]  We have the video.
[00:20:48.141 --> 00:20:49.181]  We will be showing you that.
[00:20:49.621 --> 00:20:50.682]  Oh, but it gets better!
[00:20:52.222 --> 00:20:54.724]  SNL, hip-hop nativity, same show.
[00:20:54.784 --> 00:20:57.345]  Skit shows baby Jesus twerking.
[00:20:58.725 --> 00:21:04.068]  Mary as a stripper and baby daddy Joseph with a pimp walk.
[00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:06.909]  Oh, the child shaking its ass.
[00:21:06.929 --> 00:21:08.970]  The newborn baby wants to be raped.
[00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:09.590]  I get it.
[00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.151]  It's a religion.
[00:21:12.096 --> 00:21:14.798]  You don't get in the club unless you got the dead eyes of these people.
[00:21:15.819 --> 00:21:17.720]  They look dead because they are dead.
[00:21:18.321 --> 00:21:23.585]  They've turned themselves over to absolute total evil and they think it's cute.
[00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:25.926]  They think it's funny.
[00:21:25.946 --> 00:21:29.069]  And what it really is is a message to all of us.
[00:21:29.709 --> 00:21:30.750]  They're coming for our children.
[00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.151]  We already know scumbags.
[00:21:33.932 --> 00:21:43.442]   Meanwhile, Honored and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his great team.
[00:21:45.483 --> 00:21:51.825]  Chris Wallace will join CNN as anchor for CNN Plus because Fox was about to fire him because he had the lowest ratings on their network.
[00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:54.514]  Their smallest shows have 2 million viewers.
[00:21:54.554 --> 00:21:55.675]  He had like a quarter million.
[00:21:55.995 --> 00:21:56.475]  Total joke.
[00:21:56.836 --> 00:21:57.656]  He's about to be fired.
[00:21:57.696 --> 00:21:58.677]  That's coming out.
[00:21:59.077 --> 00:22:00.998]  And so, what did he do?
[00:22:01.078 --> 00:22:03.320]  He jumped to CNN Plus.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.721]  They always make fun of us.
[00:22:04.761 --> 00:22:05.281]  It's called Internet.
[00:22:05.301 --> 00:22:05.882]  We're more than that.
[00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:06.262]  But whatever.
[00:22:06.282 --> 00:22:06.782]  Internet's great.
[00:22:06.802 --> 00:22:06.962]  Yeah.
[00:22:06.982 --> 00:22:08.003]  And the free market of ideas.
[00:22:08.023 --> 00:22:08.723]  We kick your ass.
[00:22:09.044 --> 00:22:12.946]  But, oh, now he'll be Internet only on CNN Plus.
[00:22:12.986 --> 00:22:14.167]  And look what a deviant.
[00:22:14.507 --> 00:22:16.749]  I mean, look, I'm not saying Chris Wallace is a pedophile.
[00:22:17.289 --> 00:22:24.227]   But if I was going to cast somebody for a movie, you know, that I mean, look how creepy he is.
[00:22:24.247 --> 00:22:30.412]  I mean, what a little conceited, self-centered, know-it-all piece of garbage.
[00:22:31.973 --> 00:22:41.400]  And there he is, he's honored and delighted, honored and delighted to be at CNN with John Griffin.
[00:22:42.801 --> 00:22:48.342]   He wants to be colleagues With people like that over at CNN.
[00:22:48.362 --> 00:22:49.964]  Do an overhead shot for me, please.
[00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:51.745]  Here is Chris Cuomo.
[00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:52.886]  Oh, out Chris Cuomo.
[00:22:53.086 --> 00:22:56.149]  In comes Chris Wallace.
[00:22:56.369 --> 00:22:57.830]  And he's got a new friend.
[00:22:58.291 --> 00:22:58.931]  Oh, and it gets better.
[00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:04.736]  Brian Williams signs off from MSNBC's 11th Hour after lying and saying he was shot down in a helicopter.
[00:23:05.036 --> 00:23:10.200]  Only person worse than him, Senator Blumenthal, says he was in combat in Vietnam and was never there.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.360]  Lying Scum!
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:45.240]   All right ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna do the tornadoes that hit and was it weather modification or control
[00:23:45.415 --> 00:23:48.136]  I'm gonna really give you the answers.
[00:23:49.577 --> 00:23:50.637]  Coming up next segment.
[00:23:51.358 --> 00:23:56.660]  And then Roger Stone pops in with SNL joking about gang raping his wife dying of cancer.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.162]  And you're just like, well, why do they do that?
[00:23:59.182 --> 00:24:06.909]  Because it's about searing your conscience, just getting you used to being raped with inflation and open borders and globalism and pedophilia.
[00:24:06.949 --> 00:24:07.930]  I mean, these are criminals.
[00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.613]  They get off on that they can get away with stuff.
[00:24:10.893 --> 00:24:14.117]  They'd show up at a beautiful Thanksgiving dinner at 4 p.m.
[00:24:14.137 --> 00:24:16.999]  at grandma's house and take a crap in the middle of the dressing.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:21.364]  They'd get up in front of the whole family, pull their pants down and spray diarrhea all over the food.
[00:24:22.287 --> 00:24:27.749]  I don't mean to be gross about that, but you don't understand them until you get your mind wrapped around who they are.
[00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.930]  They are predators.
[00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:33.772]  And they want to hurt good people.
[00:24:34.612 --> 00:24:35.973]  They want to lie.
[00:24:36.053 --> 00:24:37.393]  They want to hurt you.
[00:24:37.793 --> 00:24:40.935]  And they've organized themselves into communities and organizations.
[00:24:40.995 --> 00:24:44.436]  And CNN is a pedophilia mothership of evil.
[00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:54.101]  And that leads us to the vaccines that aren't vaccines, that are poison gene therapies and all the huge news there that I'm gonna hit some now and then really get into after Roger leaves us.
[00:24:54.941 --> 00:24:55.881]  Brought him in the next hour.
[00:24:57.642 --> 00:25:05.404]  But just remember, when you look at the face of this arrested charge, all the evidence says pedophile.
[00:25:08.966 --> 00:25:12.667]  Chris Cuomo's main producer, senior CNN producer, not just his show.
[00:25:14.053 --> 00:25:20.679]  And he's running rape operations, training women for sex to be sex operatives in sex training.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.741]  The general public reads that, doesn't know what they're seeing.
[00:25:23.061 --> 00:25:24.583]  That's what CNN does, I told you.
[00:25:24.903 --> 00:25:30.969]  Industrial level sex operations with little girls to go recruit other people.
[00:25:33.331 --> 00:25:38.194]  And women, if they're alone and single mothers and don't have God, get approached by authority figures.
[00:25:39.194 --> 00:25:49.180]  Once they let their child be raped like this, now they're recruiters like Ghislaine Maxwell, who you know was raped from like age two on by her father and OSS and then MI6.
[00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:52.702]  And I'm sorry to have to tell you all this, it's in the MKUltra documents.
[00:25:53.142 --> 00:25:57.885]  It's in Reset Wars that, by the way, you'll be able to get tomorrow.
[00:25:58.526 --> 00:26:00.667]  Launches at midnight tonight at ResetWars.com.
[00:26:02.008 --> 00:26:03.368]  And I'm sorry to have to tell you all this.
[00:26:03.388 --> 00:26:07.850]  I know it sounds insane, but as it comes true and you see it, you learn how these intelligence operations work.
[00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.091]  I mean, my uncle was in Iran-Contra.
[00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:18.754]  Wouldn't tell me any of it other than to say that he got out of it because they were trafficking children out of Central American orphanages.
[00:26:21.054 --> 00:26:22.735]  Okay, let's move on from there.
[00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:32.482]  So here is Chris Cuomo and the CNN senior producer who was just arrested for raping children in organized rape.
[00:26:33.323 --> 00:26:34.844]  But they want to rape your mind.
[00:26:34.904 --> 00:26:36.185]  They want to rape your soul.
[00:26:36.265 --> 00:26:43.550]  They want to rape everything that is decent and good because that gives them power over reality.
[00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.673]  So you ask yourself, why are the rats leaving the sinking ship?
[00:26:48.253 --> 00:26:53.597]  Well, because the ship is sinking and that's who they are.
[00:26:54.662 --> 00:27:06.465]  Now let's move on to the rape with a genetically engineered gene therapy that erases your immune system, is linked to massive cancer and blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:27.289]  I have literally more than 30 incredible clips today of scientists and doctors and researchers and the CDC's own documents and the FDA's own documents that taking the Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson shot gives you a negative immunity within eight months on average.
[00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:30.252]  Negative, meaning it's worse than before you took it.
[00:27:30.912 --> 00:27:31.753]  This is not a vaccine.
[00:27:32.073 --> 00:27:34.775]  I mean, a real inoculation gives you decades of immunity.
[00:27:35.816 --> 00:27:36.617]  That's not what this is.
[00:27:38.288 --> 00:27:39.709]  This goes in and programs your system.
[00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:42.731]  So like, you have a light bulb that burns for 10 years, they don't want that.
[00:27:43.031 --> 00:27:44.792]  That's a regular vaccine, still could have problems.
[00:27:45.853 --> 00:27:51.116]  These are planned obsolescence, where they work a few months, but then get rid of your immune system.
[00:27:52.617 --> 00:27:56.240]  So it'd be like, oh, this light bulb works for a couple months, then it burns your house down.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.841]  Well, I'm not going to put that light bulb in.
[00:27:59.382 --> 00:28:03.764]  Or, you've got this light bulb for a few months, but then you can never have light in your house again.
[00:28:03.985 --> 00:28:07.567]  People are like, that's not just a scam, that's criminal.
[00:28:09.904 --> 00:28:27.072]   So here is Laura Ingraham, who after Tucker Carlson has the most courage of anybody on national TV in this nation, with Dr. Byram Riddle talking about the elephant in the room That it doesn't work.
[00:28:27.212 --> 00:28:29.612]  Not just that the Omnicron gets around it.
[00:28:29.632 --> 00:28:30.893]  That's their diversion.
[00:28:31.633 --> 00:28:42.896]  You've got the famous meme of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark at the start of the movie where he's got the bag of sand and he's got the gold idol he's trying to get and, you know, oh my god, the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:28:42.956 --> 00:28:44.296]  It's not a vaccine, it's a fraud.
[00:28:44.316 --> 00:28:46.677]  Everybody's waking up to it, knowing it's a scam.
[00:28:46.697 --> 00:28:46.977]  What do we do?
[00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:51.418]  Okay, he's got to move the bag of sand onto the gold idol that's Omnicron.
[00:28:52.499 --> 00:28:54.681]  Oh, it doesn't work now because of Omicron.
[00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:55.481]  You're really sick.
[00:28:55.681 --> 00:28:57.322]  We're calling it COVID because of Omicron.
[00:28:57.743 --> 00:28:59.464]  I'm going to play clips for you next segment.
[00:29:01.325 --> 00:29:07.209]  Where I didn't just predict this a year and a half ago, which you'll see as well, but I predicted it 12 years ago.
[00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.871]  Exactly.
[00:29:09.891 --> 00:29:11.572]  And by the way, I didn't predict it.
[00:29:14.025 --> 00:29:17.970]  I had their actual breakdown, ladies and gentlemen, their plans.
[00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.991]  These people are arrogant.
[00:29:19.251 --> 00:29:20.513]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:29:20.853 --> 00:29:21.494]  And guess what?
[00:29:21.554 --> 00:29:23.576]  The globalists have tipped their hand again.
[00:29:23.696 --> 00:29:24.617]  You ask, well, why do they do it?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.224]  You ask, why don't they just shut up?
[00:29:30.925 --> 00:29:35.348]  Because they've got to tell all the agencies and groups and governments what's going to happen.
[00:29:35.388 --> 00:29:45.575]  And the drill is how they test the policy and get them used to the drill, so that when the actual system comes, they don't put two together, they just follow orders because they've done the drill a hundred times.
[00:29:45.836 --> 00:30:00.386]  Like Jim Jones giving people Kool-Aid that didn't have cyanide in it, and finally the day they've done Kool-Aid drills hundreds of times, finally by the time he gave them the real Kool-Aid with the cyanide, they didn't understand and died.
[00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.410]  We're going to show you all those documents.
[00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:08.231]  I shall get to the weather modification next hour, but I need to finish up with this.
[00:30:08.571 --> 00:30:15.672]  Here is the good doctor, Riddell, on Laura Ingraham explaining it doesn't work!
[00:30:15.812 --> 00:30:16.593]  It's a fraud!
[00:30:16.613 --> 00:30:17.153]  Here it is!
[00:30:18.373 --> 00:30:26.054]  Dr. Byron Bridle, who is the immunology professor at the University of Guelph in Canada, who is part of the group who studied the first mRNA COVID vaccines.
[00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:28.815]  Dr. Bridle, what's going on here?
[00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:31.610]  Hi Laura, thanks for having me again.
[00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.591]  I have to say, I'll just be blunt, this is absolutely ludicrous.
[00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:48.375]  This is a case of trying to take something that is completely ineffective, and by administering endless doses, somehow it seems like health professionals think this is going to suddenly become effective.
[00:30:48.775 --> 00:30:54.278]  There's so much data showing now that these vaccines can never ever achieve the goal of herd immunity.
[00:30:54.618 --> 00:31:06.584]  These are, first of all, what I want to point out is we have to keep in mind the very definition of vaccines was altered to allow that term to be applied to these current inoculations that we're giving to people.
[00:31:06.984 --> 00:31:08.745]  The duration of immunity is far too short.
[00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:20.670]  The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been effectively developing new variants that can readily evade this immunity.
[00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:29.734]  The new Omicron variant has so many mutations in the spike protein, it's going to be able to even more effectively evade vaccine-induced immunity than the Delta variant did.
[00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:42.147]  And the combination of all of these things, combined with, of course, the fact that there is, although people try and hide it as much as possible, it's becoming impossible to hide the harms that these vaccines are causing.
[00:31:42.708 --> 00:31:46.311]  And there's no question now that the cost-benefit analysis makes no sense.
[00:31:47.172 --> 00:31:52.138]  People who are, quote, fully vaccinated, which is the two doses at the moment, they can still get infected.
[00:31:52.598 --> 00:31:54.600]  They can still get COVID.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.601]  They can still get disease.
[00:31:55.621 --> 00:31:56.982]  They can still die from COVID.
[00:31:57.382 --> 00:32:04.668]  And they transmit the virus in at least equal proportion to equal quantities as those who have no immunity.
[00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:10.413]  Okay, so I told you all this with the experts 20 plus months ago, but you're not here to hear us spike the football.
[00:32:10.433 --> 00:32:11.915]  You're here to hear tomorrow's news today.
[00:32:12.235 --> 00:32:15.318]  So let me introduce something that nobody else introduced that I've been talking about for a year.
[00:32:15.738 --> 00:32:16.679]  Marek's disease.
[00:32:17.884 --> 00:32:18.964]  Gates and them aren't done.
[00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:19.785]  They put this out.
[00:32:19.825 --> 00:32:20.905]  They act like it's a process.
[00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:32.530]  They let the vaccines create the mutations, which when they create all these shots that keep destroying spike protein, it's going to create a super spike protein that kills 100%.
[00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:38.672]  And that's what they're doing is using the public to create the ultimate weapon they've already tested in labs.
[00:32:39.092 --> 00:32:41.673]  But they're making us do it to ourselves via free will.
[00:32:42.053 --> 00:32:43.494]  Merrick's disease in humans.
[00:32:48.434 --> 00:32:49.415]  All right, welcome back.
[00:32:49.435 --> 00:33:01.161]  Roger Stone's going to pop in for one segment until about 15 after to talk about Saturday Night Live, saying that they want his wife, who's dying of cancer, hopefully she lives, but she's got stage four cancer, that he needs to be gang raped.
[00:33:01.842 --> 00:33:03.923]  That's just about searing your mind, your conscience.
[00:33:04.763 --> 00:33:06.284]  It's about just training you to be a slave.
[00:33:06.925 --> 00:33:12.688]  He's going to pop in, and then I'll get into the horrible tornado that is not the worst in U.S.
[00:33:12.708 --> 00:33:12.988]  history.
[00:33:14.113 --> 00:33:18.736]  They've had tornado groups that killed 300 people in one night, not 120 or 30.
[00:33:19.376 --> 00:33:20.277]  Still, this is horrible.
[00:33:20.617 --> 00:33:24.359]  But to say that it's global warming doing it, why do we have all those tornado shelters?
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.643]  Why did people used to have that before they knew about, you know, radar and things, before that was invented?
[00:33:30.483 --> 00:33:36.707]  It was because they knew that when there were storms, they had to all go sleep in the cellar, because sometimes it would come and kill you.
[00:33:38.268 --> 00:33:42.451]  My father saw the barn in East Texas, where he grew up, destroyed once by a tornado.
[00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:47.333]  And then it went across the road and tore up one of the family's relatives' houses.
[00:33:48.034 --> 00:33:49.035]  Was that global warming?
[00:33:49.055 --> 00:33:49.835]  Was that man-made?
[00:33:49.875 --> 00:33:53.938]  We'll talk about it, bottom of the next hour, after Roger Stone leaves us.
[00:33:53.979 --> 00:34:06.028]  But, I noticed that on Instagram and Twitter, because a bunch of people sent me these, some of these had 500 views, one of them had 100-something thousand views, one had 500,000 views, just this weekend.
[00:34:06.048 --> 00:34:10.372]  But the good news is, people are taking these clips, they're finding these clips, and they're sharing them.
[00:34:11.468 --> 00:34:17.510]  Because the public gets fascinated, not by documents I show on air, but by old videos of me saying what was going to happen.
[00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:27.293]  And then we can demystify and explain how I knew this, so people can then discover how to learn this for themselves and not just listen to what I have to say.
[00:34:27.653 --> 00:34:36.275]  Because if I want to not get killed or put in prison and save the country, and if you want to do the same thing with me, we can do it together, we got to decentralize this.
[00:34:36.395 --> 00:34:38.656]  I don't want to be the guy that understands all this.
[00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:47.086]  Okay, we can do this together, but it's going to take people getting knowledge of how the globalists operate, how their mindset works, and what their tricks are.
[00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:58.014]  So, here's a clip of myself 12 years ago in 2010, or 11 and a half years ago, with Mike Adams, predicting what was going to be coming in the future.
[00:34:58.897 --> 00:35:15.572]  And then there's clips from a year and a half ago and 21 months ago of me predicting that multiple inoculations, tracker passes, the vaccines wouldn't work, they claimed that it was a variant, but really it was something they were releasing or it was caused by the vaccine.
[00:35:15.592 --> 00:35:17.034]  100% what's happened 20 months later?
[00:35:17.794 --> 00:35:18.635]  How do I nail it 100%?
[00:35:20.436 --> 00:35:28.758]  It's like if I go see Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, doesn't matter if it's a high school doing it, doesn't matter if it's a college doing it, doesn't matter if it's a professional theater doing it.
[00:35:29.078 --> 00:35:39.561]  If it says, classic Shakespeare, Romeo, Juliet, I know it will be, word for word, in the old English, Shakespeare.
[00:35:41.122 --> 00:35:42.122]  It's a program.
[00:35:42.222 --> 00:35:43.142]  It's a blueprint.
[00:35:43.242 --> 00:35:44.402]  It's an operation.
[00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:49.046]   And that's my great frustration is, Yes, the blueprint's very scary.
[00:35:49.346 --> 00:35:50.126]  Yes, it's horrible.
[00:35:50.186 --> 00:35:52.488]  Yes, it ends with 90% of us depopulated.
[00:35:52.968 --> 00:35:53.868]  Collapses civilization.
[00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:55.069]  By design.
[00:35:55.529 --> 00:35:57.230]  By a breakaway civilization absorbing us.
[00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.451]  But if we know the blueprint, we can stop it.
[00:36:00.651 --> 00:36:02.692]  But you gotta have the courage to admit you're in trouble.
[00:36:05.774 --> 00:36:10.656]  It's like most women, when a thug pulls a gun out and says, get in the van, they get in the van, they get raped and killed.
[00:36:10.776 --> 00:36:13.838]  But some women fight back, hit, run, whatever, and most of the time they live.
[00:36:15.248 --> 00:36:19.232]  Most people, especially women, will Stockholm Syndrome, and well, I guess he'll be nice.
[00:36:19.612 --> 00:36:21.734]  No, he's not going to be nice when you're tied up in that basement.
[00:36:22.615 --> 00:36:31.224]  So, you might as well just slap the gun out of the hand, run away, zigzag, attack him, whatever it is you decide to do, but don't just give in and follow orders.
[00:36:31.284 --> 00:36:33.085]  Stop acting like a jellyfish.
[00:36:33.125 --> 00:36:36.148]  So, here's myself and Mike Adams in 2010, and then clips from 2020.
[00:36:36.188 --> 00:36:36.829]  Here it is.
[00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:45.878]  During the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act, remember 2002, they wanted to have forced inoculation nationwide for smallpox?
[00:36:46.338 --> 00:37:04.667]  And it came out in news articles that, oh yeah, the feds are going to use sports stadiums and postal offices as the centers where if you refuse to be inoculated, you'll be taken and be held, but will also forcibly inoculate if we're given the orders at these injection facilities.
[00:37:05.027 --> 00:37:09.350]  You have to be able to track people, so they have to have a tracking technology in place.
[00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:20.777]  Now whether that's an RFID chip, which they're calling now electronic tattoos, or whether that is a vaccine bracelet, or some kind of paperwork that you have to carry around, I'm not sure yet.
[00:37:21.517 --> 00:37:22.758]  But that's step one.
[00:37:22.778 --> 00:37:24.619]  So they gotta have a vaccine tracking technology.
[00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:27.921]  I think that's where some of the military defense contractors are coming into play.
[00:37:28.381 --> 00:37:31.042]  But then secondly, you gotta look at the quarantines.
[00:37:31.783 --> 00:37:37.046]  If they mandate vaccines, those who refuse to be vaccinated are very likely to be quarantined.
[00:37:37.526 --> 00:37:44.808]  Which means perhaps the CDC would be leasing camps or facilities like FEMA camps from FEMA.
[00:37:44.948 --> 00:37:46.368]  Just as an example.
[00:37:46.868 --> 00:37:53.490]  And then making those quarantine camps where they throw you in with all the other people who have refused the vaccines.
[00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.830]  Go up to the front.
[00:37:55.991 --> 00:37:57.931]  I say to the guy behind the counter, don't you dare wear your mask.
[00:37:57.971 --> 00:37:59.212]  He goes, no, it's all BS.
[00:38:01.032 --> 00:38:02.632]  And I said, I'll tell you what's BS, brother.
[00:38:03.133 --> 00:38:04.493]  Horse inoculations next year.
[00:38:05.529 --> 00:38:12.833]  They're trying to make us take tracker apps on our phones that are already been activated whether you want them or not, but make you accept it, be able to travel around and live your life.
[00:38:13.533 --> 00:38:15.934]  This is their full revolution against us.
[00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:17.255]  This is the globalist move.
[00:38:18.874 --> 00:38:22.997]  We're gonna see people get in folks' faces as they leave their houses, and say, let me see your phone app!
[00:38:23.317 --> 00:38:27.200]  And your phone will have a government app, or through a corporate app, that you're authorized.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:35.025]  And they'll scan and go, and it's gonna be every season, and every, oh, new viruses, and oh, oh, you had your inoculation, even though it doesn't cover you.
[00:38:35.065 --> 00:38:38.828]  And if you say, hey, the inoculation doesn't cover you, they'll go, you're arrested!
[00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:40.189]  That's disinformation!
[00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.531]  Oliver Darcy says so.
[00:38:44.592 --> 00:38:50.006]   But remember, when they forcibly inoculate you and your child has a convulsion and dies, They killed your child.
[00:38:52.448 --> 00:38:54.510]  And that was 20 months ago.
[00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.752]  So, uh, let me, let me, well, you know what?
[00:38:57.012 --> 00:38:58.354]  I mean, do you want to see these current headlines?
[00:38:58.374 --> 00:39:03.498]  Because everything I just said a year and a half ago, two years ago, 10 years ago, 12 years ago, it's all right here.
[00:39:07.442 --> 00:39:11.746]  Dr. Fauci, Americans will just have to deal with yearly booster shots if they become necessary.
[00:39:11.966 --> 00:39:13.628]  They were always planned.
[00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:20.847]  Study shows Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness declines after six months to almost zero.
[00:39:20.987 --> 00:39:21.487]  MSM.
[00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:22.727]  But that was months ago.
[00:39:23.047 --> 00:39:26.709]  Now they're saying it's Omicron, so you're not supposed to say that the thing never worked.
[00:39:28.229 --> 00:39:32.250]  COVID-19 Pfizer BioNTech vaccine effectiveness wanes to 47%.
[00:39:33.631 --> 00:39:34.431]  That's in six months.
[00:39:34.471 --> 00:39:36.452]  Now we know a year later to almost zero.
[00:39:37.212 --> 00:39:39.393]  Pfizer vaccine protection wanes after six months.
[00:39:39.413 --> 00:39:40.053]  Study finds.
[00:39:41.607 --> 00:39:48.110]  WebMD, and now today, Twitter will now ban users that repeatedly claim vaccinated people can spread COVID.
[00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.291]  In fact, you're more likely to, but it's okay!
[00:39:52.832 --> 00:39:54.392]  You'll just be banned if you talk about it.
[00:39:56.493 --> 00:39:59.755]  Fauci says Omicron can evade vaccine protection, but boosters help.
[00:40:00.155 --> 00:40:02.656]  So see, at first they're like, okay, the vaccine didn't work.
[00:40:02.736 --> 00:40:03.596]  Oh, it's Omicron!
[00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:05.577]  Don't say it was always a fraud.
[00:40:05.797 --> 00:40:07.298]  You need new shots because Omicron.
[00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.959]  How did Alex Jones say 20 months ago this was coming?
[00:40:11.181 --> 00:40:16.562]  Bill Gates put out a prospectus to shareholders that this would be shots 7 to 10 times a year.
[00:40:16.582 --> 00:40:20.303]  Pfizer jab is only 23% effective against Omicron.
[00:40:20.643 --> 00:40:22.904]  South African said, he says, but you're not allowed to say that.
[00:40:22.944 --> 00:40:24.204]  I mean, Twitter said so.
[00:40:26.225 --> 00:40:29.265]  Omicron can strike within four months of vaccination.
[00:40:29.325 --> 00:40:32.246]  Seniors, South African doctors said, oh, you gotta get it every four months now.
[00:40:33.502 --> 00:40:35.342]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:40:35.362 --> 00:40:37.283]  We got so much more having to hit on that front.
[00:40:37.703 --> 00:40:39.863]  And people paralyzed and being killed and admitting it.
[00:40:40.343 --> 00:40:41.203]  Their families speak out.
[00:40:41.223 --> 00:40:43.084]  They get banned or arrested in Australia.
[00:40:43.544 --> 00:40:51.265]  Oh, and they're now arresting members of the government, randomly senators in Australia that are against the lockdowns, and taking them to facilities saying, we're just going to see if you're sick.
[00:40:51.485 --> 00:40:54.706]  And when they test not positive, they say, we don't care, you're locked up now.
[00:40:55.006 --> 00:40:56.926]  I mean, it's all just a pretend.
[00:40:57.006 --> 00:40:59.427]  Oh, we're not rounding up and arresting you because we don't like your politics.
[00:40:59.867 --> 00:41:00.227]  No, no, no.
[00:41:00.267 --> 00:41:01.148]  It's Build Back Better.
[00:41:01.188 --> 00:41:02.448]  Wink, wink, UN Takeover.
[00:41:02.809 --> 00:41:03.909]  But we're locking you up.
[00:41:03.949 --> 00:41:07.731]  That's all coming up next hour as well.
[00:41:07.771 --> 00:41:16.415]  And oh, they're now handing out over schools around the Western world heart attack kits because they say the new normals, lots of heart attacks in small children.
[00:41:17.836 --> 00:41:22.038]  So that's coming up next hour as well.
[00:41:23.464 --> 00:41:25.765]  But Roger Stone, you know, has the comics.
[00:41:26.286 --> 00:41:29.508]  You know, the comics that have Joe Biden on the comics that say world government's good.
[00:41:30.348 --> 00:41:33.730]  The comics like Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live.
[00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:37.573]  Well, the comics say gang raping his wife is a good thing.
[00:41:37.913 --> 00:41:41.055]  That's their little message, gang rape your wife that's got stage four cancer.
[00:41:41.075 --> 00:41:42.455]  And you're just like, why would they do that?
[00:41:42.495 --> 00:41:48.779]  Because it's about them being the villains and getting away with it, trying to invoke Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:41:48.959 --> 00:41:49.700]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:41:50.987 --> 00:41:56.692]  This audience of badasses of every race, color, and creed that love God and love justice don't have Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:41:57.092 --> 00:41:58.713]  And you're awake and you know what's going on.
[00:41:58.753 --> 00:42:05.519]  You've kept us on air despite all the Democratic Party attacks and the law firms that sued Remington into bankruptcy.
[00:42:05.799 --> 00:42:10.043]  We are fighting them and haven't done that in four years because of your support.
[00:42:10.103 --> 00:42:12.585]  And you've dumped your money into us and it's beautiful.
[00:42:12.605 --> 00:42:13.886]  You've got great products at the same time.

[00:43:18.257 --> 00:43:27.898]   in 2015
[00:43:27.898 --> 00:43:34.438]   agriculture distribution giant Cargill sponsored the food reaction game a simulation that would
[00:43:34.438 --> 00:43:40.378]   end with a global carbon tax The game itself created an opportunity to live into the future.
[00:43:40.498 --> 00:43:43.200]  It caused people to think through what the possibilities are.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.364]  And in that process, I think they realized what they have to start to do today to prepare for that future.
[00:43:48.624 --> 00:43:59.791]  According to the Cargill website, 65 international policy makers, academics, business and thought leaders gathered at the World Wildlife Fund's headquarters in Washington, D.C.
[00:43:59.831 --> 00:44:04.114]  to simulate how the world would respond to a future food crisis.
[00:44:04.454 --> 00:44:07.536]  The game took the players from the year 2020 to 2030.
[00:44:08.576 --> 00:44:12.239]  As it was projected, the decade brought two major food crises.
[00:44:12.659 --> 00:44:29.330]  With prices approaching 400% of the long-term average, a raft of climate-related extreme weather events, governments toppling in Pakistan and Ukraine, and famine and refugee crises in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Chad, and Sudan.
[00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:34.414]  The challenges and crises that we were assigned are exactly what we expect to see in the future.
[00:44:34.494 --> 00:44:39.397]  So you've got famine, you've got increased pests, you've got the role of climate change in the world.
[00:44:39.537 --> 00:44:55.003]  The most eye-catching result, however, was a deal between the US, the EU, India and China standing in for the top 20 greenhouse gas emitters to institute a global carbon tax and cap CO2 emissions in 2030.
[00:44:55.103 --> 00:45:02.686]  The situation got so dire that they were forced into bilateral and even trilateral negotiations and meetings.
[00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:08.008]  And we were able to get all the other major parties to agree to a price on carbon and then to immediately start moving towards trading.
[00:45:08.248 --> 00:45:22.754]  Years later, Cargill would come to be known as the worst company in the world regarding environmental conservation accountability, while the food game itself would prove to be a big corporation global carbon tax plan directive.
[00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:34.879]  Today, with partners like the IMF, World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, we're calling to bringing in carbon pricing to triple it.
[00:45:35.862 --> 00:45:41.628]  On emissions up from about 21% of emissions covered by a price on pollution around the world to get to 60%.
[00:45:43.462 --> 00:45:46.024]  Covered by a price on pollution by 2030.
[00:45:46.884 --> 00:46:05.775]  The carbon tax has what is called a regressive impact in the sense that it's paid by everybody, whether you earn 50,000 francs a year or 100,000 francs or 200,000 francs, you pay just based upon your consumption of carbon dioxide.
[00:46:05.795 --> 00:46:06.555]  Hurts the poor more than anybody.
[00:46:06.916 --> 00:46:11.518]  And for people at the bottom of the wage scale, it's a death sentence.
[00:46:11.558 --> 00:46:12.379]  It's a big problem.
[00:46:12.699 --> 00:46:28.557]  The impact of corporate manipulation via the plandemic's tyrannical impact on third world countries has already created a famine affecting 68 million people, proving there is nothing organic about the state of the geopolitical landscape.
[00:46:28.717 --> 00:46:33.661]  Corporations and their lackeys inhabiting the corporatocracy in Washington, D.C.
[00:46:33.881 --> 00:46:53.837]  are waging a covert war on Western civilization in order to manifest the trillion-dollar tyrannical windfall of global carbon taxes and the implementation of Great Reset Totalitarianism, as the greatest transfer of wealth in world history continues on its course of human enslavement.
[00:46:54.177 --> 00:46:55.298]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:46:57.008 --> 00:46:58.890]  What you just saw is everything.
[00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:13.842]  This is an organized elite war on the general public to consolidate power and control and starve us while they go, oh, the Earth's collapsing, we're saving you from it, when their lockdowns and their policies create it.
[00:47:14.562 --> 00:47:15.703]  And it's in all the war games.
[00:47:16.324 --> 00:47:17.204]  So look at this article.
[00:47:17.224 --> 00:47:18.806]  We're going to cover it after Roger Stone leaves us.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:23.724]  IMF, 10 countries simulate cyber attack on global financial system.
[00:47:24.184 --> 00:47:29.990]  And they admit it's coming, it's imminent, they're going to launch it and use it to further devastate economies and consolidate control.
[00:47:30.638 --> 00:47:38.001]  Just like they war-gamed with Event 201 right before COVID, they've already told their people who are all in on it, at every level, get ready.
[00:47:38.461 --> 00:47:41.463]  The next agenda of Build Back Better is to collapse civilization.
[00:47:41.743 --> 00:47:43.124]  They're environmental terrorists.
[00:47:43.724 --> 00:47:45.084]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:47:45.104 --> 00:47:46.205]  It's about total control.
[00:47:46.585 --> 00:47:47.646]  This is imminent.
[00:47:48.346 --> 00:47:53.508]  Imminent massive cyber attacks that are going to make the COVID lockdowns look pale in significance.
[00:47:53.848 --> 00:47:54.308]  Stay with us.
[00:47:54.149 --> 00:48:15.149]  this Roger Stone straight ahead.
[00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:27.297]  But particularly in late night comedy, that's now the main voice, the main propaganda with Joe Biden just on Jimmy Fallon, reading off a teleprompter, reading off cue cards and bumbling all over himself.
[00:48:28.618 --> 00:48:33.614]   And so when you Saturday Night Live.
[00:48:35.795 --> 00:48:39.677]  Making jokes about gang raping somebody's wife who's fighting for their lives with cancer.
[00:48:40.097 --> 00:48:41.618]  That's a threat, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:42.698 --> 00:48:51.102]  You add to everything that's been done to Roger Stone, and now myself, and some of the stuff I can't tell you on air yet, but if you think what you've heard on the news is bad, it's very bad.
[00:48:51.142 --> 00:48:57.945]  And when I am persecuted behind the scenes, they don't want me to talk about it yet.
[00:48:58.225 --> 00:49:02.929]   There's reasons not to, but I'm not worried about myself or Roger being under attack.
[00:49:02.949 --> 00:49:03.649]  We're tough guys.
[00:49:03.669 --> 00:49:04.249]  We can handle it.
[00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:11.050]  I mean, certainly we signed on for this, but America's children, America's women, all of our innocent people are under attack.
[00:49:11.271 --> 00:49:14.051]  And as Trump always said, they're not coming after me because they want me.
[00:49:14.511 --> 00:49:16.192]  I'm standing in the way for you.
[00:49:16.212 --> 00:49:17.092]  And it's totally true.
[00:49:18.212 --> 00:49:21.333]  So when they come out and do this, it's totally and completely a threat.
[00:49:22.572 --> 00:49:29.540]  And it's disgusting and they also attacked Jesus and said the baby Jesus is basically a prostitute being pimped out by his father.
[00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:31.943]  I mean this is all a pedophile culture.
[00:49:32.905 --> 00:49:35.588]  As you now see coming out with Chris Cuomo's producer.
[00:49:36.232 --> 00:49:39.314]  Doing the sex training of little children, I guess, for sex ops.
[00:49:39.414 --> 00:49:40.374]  I mean, it's all coming out.
[00:49:40.774 --> 00:49:42.095]  These are some monstrous people.
[00:49:42.956 --> 00:49:46.818]  Roger Stone, I know you're on the road in Tulsa, Oklahoma, another big speaking engagement.
[00:49:47.118 --> 00:49:52.061]  Thanks for getting back to your hotel room, even though you're busy, to pop in and address the situation.
[00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:59.565]  I want to play the clip, though, so people have it in context, and we'll get your take on people talking about gang raping your wife who's fighting for her life.
[00:49:59.585 --> 00:49:59.905]  Here it is.
[00:50:04.546 --> 00:50:15.293]  Trump advisor Roger Stone, who draws his glasses on with a sharpie, refused to cooperate with the committee investigating the January 6th attacks.
[00:50:15.553 --> 00:50:20.496]  Though Stone said he would be open to sitting in the corner watching the committee take turns on his wife.
[00:50:23.978 --> 00:50:28.500]  So, Roger, again, this is so sick.
[00:50:30.416 --> 00:50:33.057]  And it just goes to the system collapsing.
[00:50:33.097 --> 00:50:34.057]  What do you make of this?
[00:50:36.058 --> 00:50:37.998]  Well, Alex, it's disgusting.
[00:50:38.258 --> 00:50:39.239]  I mean, it's repugnant.
[00:50:39.459 --> 00:50:44.440]  Last night, around 11 o'clock, my phone started ringing off the hook with people outraged about this.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:58.404]  I just took a call from General Michael Flynn, who is furious, has addressed it on his telegram, social media, attacking a 75-year-old woman who's struggling with stage 4 cancer and winning her battle with cancer.
[00:50:59.013 --> 00:51:03.416]  By the way, if you understand cancer, you understand that stress is the worst thing.
[00:51:03.957 --> 00:51:05.498]  That drama is the worst thing.
[00:51:05.578 --> 00:51:08.681]  Who would attack a 75-year-old woman struggling for cancer?
[00:51:08.701 --> 00:51:10.322]  If you don't like me, attack me.
[00:51:10.362 --> 00:51:11.283]  Make fun of my glasses.
[00:51:11.523 --> 00:51:12.183]  Help yourself.
[00:51:12.724 --> 00:51:14.785]  But this is the lowest of the low.
[00:51:15.026 --> 00:51:18.768]  I mean, it really, you can hear the canned laugh track.
[00:51:18.808 --> 00:51:19.949]  There's nobody laughing at this.
[00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.491]  Because it's not funny.
[00:51:22.011 --> 00:51:23.632]  Gang rape is not funny.
[00:51:23.672 --> 00:51:25.173]  There's nothing funny about it.
[00:51:26.014 --> 00:51:26.695]  I'm disgusted.
[00:51:27.075 --> 00:51:28.336]  It is just beyond belief.
[00:51:29.269 --> 00:51:31.090]  But I think it really shows the desperation.
[00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.651]  You've got Cuomo in deep trouble.
[00:51:33.112 --> 00:51:39.295]  You've got his producer running reported pedophile ops, training children for sex ops, raping children to train them like Epstein did.
[00:51:39.976 --> 00:51:41.377]  You've got Chris Wallace leaving.
[00:51:41.677 --> 00:51:44.899]  You've got Brian Williams leaving because of no ratings.
[00:51:44.959 --> 00:51:47.401]  I mean, this really is a zombie media.
[00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:54.045]  And now it's running to the lifeboat of comedy shows, but that's destroyed the ratings of those as well.
[00:51:54.345 --> 00:51:57.087]  And it's now made them one of the most hated groups anywhere.
[00:51:58.314 --> 00:51:59.915]  Here's the most amazing thing, Alex.
[00:52:00.736 --> 00:52:04.398]  As of this Thursday, the doctors say my wife is cancer-free.
[00:52:04.639 --> 00:52:04.959]  Whoa!
[00:52:05.079 --> 00:52:14.866]  Which means she's won this epic struggle with cancer, and she's done it using homeopathic, holistic, and all natural programs and therapies.
[00:52:15.326 --> 00:52:19.149]  Certain drugs the FDA will never approve for use against cancer.
[00:52:19.649 --> 00:52:21.270]  So God has answered our prayers.
[00:52:21.831 --> 00:52:24.172]  God has answered the prayers of people around the globe.
[00:52:24.753 --> 00:52:27.755]  Now the key is for her to stay cancer-free.
[00:52:28.679 --> 00:52:32.561]  And one of the things is a minimum of stress, of certain tranquility.
[00:52:33.122 --> 00:52:48.771]  So, in the wake of this good news, in the wake of this miracle by Jesus Christ, and it is a miracle, because they told us she had little chance of survival, and I am grateful to the Lord for healing my wife, I have to put up with this crap.
[00:52:50.082 --> 00:52:55.867]  Now the key is to remain cancer-free, which means she has to stay on this all-natural regimen.
[00:52:55.887 --> 00:52:59.090]  We're talking about massive vitamin infusions.
[00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:03.774]  And Roger, I want to talk about that with you in a moment, but let's just go back to this attack.
[00:53:04.175 --> 00:53:05.896]  Who brings somebody's wife into it?
[00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:12.362]  And the committee with you and I is talking about, once they testify, we're going to arrest them for lying, as if we're going to lie.
[00:53:12.742 --> 00:53:16.045]  Why do we go into a political thing where the head of the committee is suing Trump?
[00:53:16.525 --> 00:53:21.468]  And where they say we're going to give them this information for a criminal indictment, when they're saying we're guilty up front?
[00:53:21.708 --> 00:53:23.329]  That's not how American justice works.
[00:53:23.629 --> 00:53:31.094]  If there was a real committee that had real Republicans on it, it wasn't a legal committee, which they on record admit it's not constituted properly, I would go testify.
[00:53:31.114 --> 00:53:32.675]  We have nothing to hide, January 6th.
[00:53:33.015 --> 00:53:34.256]  But this is just outrageous.
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.000]  Yeah, look, I've already been down this road.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:45.022]  They hope to fact frame me in some new fabricated process crime, which is why I will invoke my Fifth Amendment rights.
[00:53:45.382 --> 00:53:49.543]  No one in their right mind would go answer questions from this partisan witch hunt.
[00:53:49.843 --> 00:53:57.285]  The chairman of the committee has already sued Donald Trump, proving that this is not an honest, fair, fact-finding mission.
[00:53:57.805 --> 00:54:00.226]  Adam Schiff, we already know the story about him.
[00:54:00.526 --> 00:54:02.126]  Believe me, I've been down this road.
[00:54:02.848 --> 00:54:08.506]  I'm going to revoke my Fifth Amendment rights not to be framed, which is what this is really all about.
[00:54:08.887 --> 00:54:09.409]  Now, again...
[00:54:10.248 --> 00:54:12.009]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[00:54:12.509 --> 00:54:15.910]  Your point is, and I'm in the same boat, and I thank the listeners for being my life raft.
[00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:17.030]  We're fighting for them.
[00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:17.950]  They're fighting for us.
[00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.210]  Absolutely.
[00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:20.871]  You're living in a small apartment.
[00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:21.931]  They bankrupted you.
[00:54:22.371 --> 00:54:25.152]  You're a standard of liberty fighting them.
[00:54:25.192 --> 00:54:26.092]  They want to destroy you.
[00:54:26.392 --> 00:54:27.853]  If they're successful, they have a big win.
[00:54:27.893 --> 00:54:37.316]   So listeners, buying t-shirts, buying your book, supporting you, giving to the Stone Defense funds, it's going to cost us, I know, a quarter million dollars to be able to fight.
[00:54:37.336 --> 00:54:38.537]  I know that's what lawyers have told me.
[00:54:38.557 --> 00:54:43.239]  We've already spent like 50 grand responding to multiple subpoenas, all the harassment.
[00:54:43.499 --> 00:54:44.920]  How do people, Roger, support you?
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.763]  StoneFamilyFund.com is the best place to go.
[00:54:49.863 --> 00:54:55.769]  Stone Family Fund is the first and most important thing I have to do is fund next month's cancer treatments.
[00:54:56.289 --> 00:54:59.192]  Beyond that, you're right Alex, the lawyers are just grinding me down.
[00:54:59.312 --> 00:55:01.154]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:55:01.654 --> 00:55:04.597]  If you want to get a great t-shirt, go to RogerStoneStore.com.
[00:55:05.979 --> 00:55:07.962]  But I'm glad to be here with the Info Warriors.
[00:55:08.043 --> 00:55:11.529]  I saw your colleague and my friend Owen Schroyer in Dallas.
[00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:12.671]  We had a great time together.
[00:55:13.553 --> 00:55:16.098]  You know, I try not to let this dampen my spirits.
[00:55:16.598 --> 00:55:17.841]  We have to keep fighting.
[00:55:18.533 --> 00:55:26.555]  InfoWars is still a beacon of truth in this incredibly murky situation in which we're in.
[00:55:26.915 --> 00:55:28.836]  People need to support InfoWars.
[00:55:29.476 --> 00:55:31.717]  People need to support you and your legal struggles.
[00:55:32.117 --> 00:55:35.097]  I appreciate the support that InfoWars has generated for me.
[00:55:35.338 --> 00:55:40.498]   By the way, for folks that don't know, General Flynn lost his house and everything he had
[00:55:40.498 --> 00:55:42.978]  in just one defense.
[00:55:42.978 --> 00:55:45.138]  You've been through at least 10 attacks.
[00:55:45.138 --> 00:55:48.478]  I've been through 50, though yours was bigger and criminal.
[00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:50.818]  And so believe me, I know everything you're talking about.
[00:55:50.818 --> 00:55:53.577]  I've sold my house to pay for all this, which is fine.
[00:55:53.577 --> 00:55:59.458]   I don't care it's a war, but it shows how incredibly serious the situation is and how
[00:55:59.458 --> 00:56:00.697]  they want to take you off air.
[00:56:01.509 --> 00:56:03.349]  And on one level, I'm very proud.
[00:56:03.389 --> 00:56:04.489]  I'm not a prideful person.
[00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:07.310]  I'm not an arrogant person, but I am an aggressive, confident person.
[00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:11.171]  But I'll say, I really am proud of these evil people persecuting us.
[00:56:11.211 --> 00:56:11.891]  I don't enjoy it.
[00:56:12.271 --> 00:56:12.891]  I don't like it.
[00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:15.532]  But at the end of the day, you know a man by his enemies, Roger.
[00:56:15.752 --> 00:56:18.052]  And we've got the worst people on earth after us.
[00:56:18.332 --> 00:56:21.633]  We've got the best people on earth praying for us and supporting us.
[00:56:21.873 --> 00:56:24.473]  And that's why I thank the listeners from the bottom of my heart.
[00:56:24.493 --> 00:56:26.634]  When they call in and thank me and Gush, I go, whoa!
[00:56:27.114 --> 00:56:29.895]  I get tears in my eyes when I'm on the street and a family's thanking me.
[00:56:29.915 --> 00:56:31.576]  I mean, no, no, no.
[00:56:31.716 --> 00:56:32.576]  I'm thanking them.
[00:56:32.816 --> 00:56:36.557]  They are literally our life preserver in this dangerous sea.
[00:56:38.338 --> 00:56:46.501]  You know, Alex, when I lost my home, my savings, my car, my insurance, I thought to myself, if I had my wife and my belief in God, I had everything.
[00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:51.371]  Now, my wife's life was in danger and she has miraculously been healed.
[00:56:51.831 --> 00:56:56.033]  I don't need a bunch of elitist crap heads in New York attacking her.
[00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:58.834]  Folks, go to StoneFamilyFund.com.
[00:56:58.854 --> 00:57:00.314]  StoneFamilyFund.com.
[00:57:00.694 --> 00:57:01.715]  We appreciate your prayers.
[00:57:01.975 --> 00:57:03.495]  We appreciate your support, Alex.
[00:57:03.835 --> 00:57:04.535]  And God bless you.
[00:57:04.916 --> 00:57:05.556]  Roger, be safe.
[00:57:05.576 --> 00:57:06.276]  We'll talk to you more.
[00:57:06.676 --> 00:57:10.819]  Yeah, Roger and I, they're saying they want to put us in jail if we don't give them the proof we attacked the Capitol.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.181]  It doesn't exist.
[00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:13.442]  Same thing as Sandy Hook.
[00:57:13.522 --> 00:57:15.263]  Give us the proof you made money off Sandy Hook.
[00:57:15.403 --> 00:57:15.884]  Doesn't exist.
[00:57:16.184 --> 00:57:17.765]  Okay, you're defaulted.
[00:57:17.785 --> 00:57:18.646]  You don't get a jury trial.
[00:57:19.446 --> 00:57:20.027]  But it's okay.
[00:57:20.287 --> 00:57:25.231]  We're going to stay on air and expose their agenda, expose their criminal activities, no matter how many attacks they launch.
[00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:28.474]  That's why we're launching new shows, new broadcasts, new information.
[00:57:28.494 --> 00:57:30.835]  We've got so much in the pipeline coming soon.
[00:57:30.656 --> 00:57:46.855]  Stay with us.
[00:57:46.855 --> 00:57:49.096]  (dramatic music)
[00:57:49.208 --> 00:57:55.312]  But two big things I want to announce that support the broadcast and are also powerful game changers.
[00:57:55.612 --> 00:58:09.281]   1776coin.com is the limited 10,000 run coin, and anybody that buys the coin and gives us your email or contact information, He's going to be given exclusive content and exclusive information coming up in the very near future.
[00:58:09.321 --> 00:58:10.522]  I'd say within two to three months.
[00:58:10.562 --> 00:58:13.123]  But regardless, you're funding the next level of the InfoWar.
[00:58:13.424 --> 00:58:15.925]  I'm committed to launching all these new attacks against the New World Order.
[00:58:16.285 --> 00:58:17.966]  And believe me, you think we've already put up a fight?
[00:58:18.006 --> 00:58:19.167]  You're going to see even a bigger fight.
[00:58:19.527 --> 00:58:20.688]  I'm in full war mode.
[00:58:20.768 --> 00:58:23.069]  OK, just absolutely in a war footing.
[00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:24.570]  I was born for this time.
[00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:26.752]  We're now entering 2022 is the year of the tiger.
[00:58:27.072 --> 00:58:28.773]  We are going all the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:29.213 --> 00:58:30.154]  Operation Tiger.
[00:58:30.514 --> 00:58:31.254]  Get ready for it.
[00:58:31.334 --> 00:58:34.637]  And you're fueling up the mothership for the main attack we're going in.
[00:58:34.657 --> 00:58:37.358]  We're going to really peacefully, with the truth, destroy the enemy.
[00:58:37.378 --> 00:58:38.679]  It's going to be spectacular.
[00:58:38.699 --> 00:58:40.700]  Next year is what I was born for.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.201]  Get ready.
[00:58:41.721 --> 00:58:42.101]  1776coin.com.
[00:58:42.281 --> 00:58:46.224]  It's going to sell out tonight.
[00:58:46.264 --> 00:58:48.425]  Wish we would have made more, but it's a one-time limited run.
[00:58:48.465 --> 00:58:48.845]  That's it.
[00:58:48.865 --> 00:58:50.886]  You want one of these historic coins?
[00:58:50.967 --> 00:58:51.647]  Tonight's the night.
[00:58:51.987 --> 00:58:52.487]  Separately.
[00:58:54.509 --> 00:58:58.071]  We backed it off over a week for its release because I decided to add even more.
[00:58:59.324 --> 00:59:03.430]  Powerful developments in information with Elon Musk and so much more of what he's been talking about.
[00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:06.554]  How they're putting false operating systems in us and how to deprogram.
[00:59:08.223 --> 00:59:09.263]  It's over six hours.
[00:59:09.463 --> 00:59:10.323]  It's my best work.
[00:59:10.764 --> 00:59:15.525]  It's absolute science and technology, how to break the trance, how to break the programming.
[00:59:16.065 --> 00:59:17.505]  It's resetwars.com.
[00:59:17.565 --> 00:59:18.985]  It drops at midnight tonight.
[00:59:19.445 --> 00:59:23.486]  And you will have two days to get the course at 25% off.
[00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.166]  And then that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:25.527 --> 00:59:29.847]  And this course is also going to fund a whole bunch of other amazing things we're doing on our next level.
[00:59:29.867 --> 00:59:30.708]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:59:31.208 --> 00:59:32.328]  But this is hardcore.
[00:59:33.581 --> 00:59:39.265]  This is bringing in all the top minds and the experts and the production crews and everything to go next level.
[00:59:39.285 --> 00:59:40.406]  So you want to fuel the ship?
[00:59:40.526 --> 00:59:42.548]  We're not going to Mars, we're going to Valhalla.
[00:59:42.568 --> 00:59:45.070]  You want to fuel the ship to defeat the New World Order?
[00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:47.071]  You want to be part of the Mayflower 2.0?
[00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:50.273]  Want to be part of Towards Washington 2.0?
[00:59:50.394 --> 00:59:51.574]  This is it.
[00:59:51.714 --> 00:59:53.356]  We don't just talk, we've done it together.
[00:59:53.616 --> 00:59:56.538]  This is the spirit of 1776.
[00:59:56.578 --> 00:59:58.640]  This is 1776 Worldwide.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.623]  ResetWars.com drops at midnight central tonight.
[01:00:04.204 --> 01:00:06.786]  25% off for two days.
[01:00:07.446 --> 01:00:08.506]  And that's the discount on it.
[01:00:08.526 --> 01:00:09.227]  That's what we're doing.
[01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:16.710]  And from this, we're going to launch a whole new system and so much more at ResetWars.com.
[01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.550]  25% off.
[01:00:17.951 --> 01:00:22.713]  You'll have 48 hours at midnight to get the 25% off.
[01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:26.134]  I want to thank you all for your support and salute you and thank you.
[01:00:26.655 --> 01:00:26.935]  Okay.
[01:00:30.404 --> 01:00:38.728]  When we see SNL in the same episode, they talk about gang raping of Roger Stone's wife, who I knew had stage 4, and he was really worried about even a month ago that she wouldn't make it privately.
[01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.951]  And now they say that it's, the cancer's in remission.
[01:00:43.811 --> 01:00:45.972]  So that's super wonderful news.
[01:00:46.553 --> 01:00:52.696]  In the same show, talking about raping her last night, they had a hip-hop nativity skit that I'm not even going to show you.
[01:00:53.276 --> 01:00:59.920]  A baby Jesus twerking, shaking his butt, wanting to have sex with adults, and his father selling him into sex slavery.
[01:01:01.249 --> 01:01:08.375]  And then of course, during the real world, over at CNN with Cuomo, who helped cover up sending 20,000 people to their deaths in nursing homes, giving them no treatment.
[01:01:08.755 --> 01:01:18.924]  This monster pig, with an individual now indicted, with witnesses of getting women to train their 9-year-old daughters that he would have sex with, for sex training to serve the elite.
[01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:23.015]  So, burgeoning Jeffrey Epstein, probably trained by him.
[01:01:23.635 --> 01:01:24.636]  People should look into all that.
[01:01:25.317 --> 01:01:28.219]  Brian Williams signs off on MSNBC's 11th Hour.
[01:01:28.239 --> 01:01:31.061]  For the last time, I'll show myself out.
[01:01:32.543 --> 01:01:37.627]  He got caught saying five years ago he was shot down in a helicopter by an RPG.
[01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:38.788]  Turned out none of it was true.
[01:01:38.808 --> 01:01:43.552]  All of it was a lie, just like Senator Blumenthal, Mr. Stolen Valor.
[01:01:45.461 --> 01:01:48.323]  And then he goes on to say, but America's so evil, Republicans are so bad.
[01:01:48.543 --> 01:01:54.407]  He says, I'm a conservative, and America's bad, and Trump's bad, and the conspiracy terrorists are bad.
[01:01:54.427 --> 01:01:56.048]  You're a piece of filth.
[01:01:56.168 --> 01:01:57.128]  All you do is lie.
[01:01:58.049 --> 01:02:00.190]  Another piece of filth.
[01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:04.333]  Lowest ratings in the whole 24 hours on Fox News.
[01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:05.874]  A couple hundred thousand viewers.
[01:02:05.894 --> 01:02:07.735]  Other smallest shows had over a million and a half.
[01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:16.250]  Chris Wallace, the toady of the establishment, saying that, oh, Biden gives incredible speeches, and Biden's so smart, and the vaccine works so well.
[01:02:16.511 --> 01:02:18.153]  I mean, whatever he says, it's the opposite.
[01:02:18.173 --> 01:02:20.396]  If he tells you it's midnight, it's high noon.
[01:02:20.676 --> 01:02:24.441]  If he tells you it's, you know, blue sky outside, you better believe it's the end of the world.
[01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:32.303]  He's delighted, honored, and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his big pedophile team over at CNN.
[01:02:32.323 --> 01:02:36.805]  The actual quote was, honored and delighted to join Jeff Zucker and his great team.
[01:02:36.845 --> 01:02:39.686]  Yes, it's a perfect place for you.
[01:02:39.726 --> 01:02:46.628]  Never trumper Chris Wallace announces he's leaving Fox News because I guess they're not friendly to his way of things.
[01:02:47.328 --> 01:02:48.509]  So Chris Wallace quits Fox.
[01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:51.270]  This is my final Fox Sunday show.
[01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:51.830]  There you go.
[01:02:53.294 --> 01:03:09.048]  And he'll be going over to CNN, where there's just such wonderful, wonderful people that reportedly run sex training dungeons, where the mothers introduce their children to sex ops for the group that runs the CIA.
[01:03:09.328 --> 01:03:10.309]  CNN runs the CIA.
[01:03:10.409 --> 01:03:11.350]  I mean, let's be clear.
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.373]  CNN is the highest level of filth in America.
[01:03:15.385 --> 01:03:29.535]  It's an intelligence agency in and of itself, dedicated to evil, dedicated to murder, dedicated to the Georgia Guidestones, dedicated to the destruction of this country, and the highest rating of evil I would give any public organization.
[01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:36.119]  I mean, it is Satan's armpit, to say the least, and just an absolute enemy of the people.
[01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:40.863]  And just remember, you've got, there's Ghislaine Maxwell at the Queen's Cabin.
[01:03:41.645 --> 01:03:51.631]  With Jeffrey Epstein, well trained by MI6 in sex ops, and then you've got Ghislaine Maxwell with the Steve Jobs wife who funds most liberal organizations.
[01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:54.732]  Here she is saying the great fake child sex trafficking epidemic.
[01:03:55.032 --> 01:04:00.115]  Her publication just says there's no sex trafficking, nobody's hurting children, everything's fine, that's who they are.
[01:04:00.155 --> 01:04:00.716]  Just remember that.
[01:04:01.036 --> 01:04:02.376]  But they're liberal, so it's okay.
[01:04:03.797 --> 01:04:06.819]  So I thought I would just spend a few minutes on that.
[01:04:08.607 --> 01:04:12.069]  And then when we come back in a few minutes, because I want to just really have plenty of time to get to this.
[01:04:12.869 --> 01:04:16.512]  Liberals use deadly tornadoes to attack Republicans on climate change.
[01:04:16.892 --> 01:04:21.254]  Biden calls on EPA to investigate role of climate crisis in deadly tornadoes.
[01:04:21.715 --> 01:04:26.117]  FEMA administrator says extreme weather going to be our new normal because of climate change.
[01:04:26.157 --> 01:04:27.338]  Oh yeah, tornadoes are new now.
[01:04:28.438 --> 01:04:34.162]  Also, Biden delivers global warming word salad and remarks on deadly Kentucky twisters.
[01:04:34.922 --> 01:04:38.144]  All of, oh, and Jesse Small, I mean, excuse me, not Jesse Small.
[01:04:39.002 --> 01:04:43.124]  Representative Swallowswell has come on and blamed Rand Paul for the tornadoes.
[01:04:43.884 --> 01:04:45.444]  So all of that's coming up.
[01:04:45.524 --> 01:04:47.285]  Over 100 feared dead in Kentucky alone.
[01:04:47.785 --> 01:04:49.306]  Tornadoes ripped through the heartland.
[01:04:50.926 --> 01:04:52.407]  We've got all of that.
[01:04:52.427 --> 01:05:02.931]  But these tornadoes really happened, unlike the attack on Jesse Smollett, or Smollet, as some of the comedians have called him.
[01:05:02.951 --> 01:05:03.631]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:06.911]  And we're going to come back and we're going to look at this fraud.
[01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:12.973]  We're going to hear from the CIA director about the tornadoes and on whether the CIA can create tornadoes.
[01:05:13.013 --> 01:05:13.913]  Not from Alex Jones.
[01:05:15.473 --> 01:05:20.255]  But I'm going to tie this whole paradox together when we return.
[01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:23.976]  So again, this is not a spectator sport.
[01:05:24.056 --> 01:05:25.377]  This is a war.
[01:05:26.677 --> 01:05:29.558]  The propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[01:05:30.038 --> 01:05:31.099]  You are the resistance.
[01:05:31.179 --> 01:05:31.959]  You are the answer.
[01:05:33.835 --> 01:05:34.815]  Start your own show.
[01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:36.115]  Go talk to Congress.
[01:05:36.135 --> 01:05:37.796]  Go talk to your local city council.
[01:05:37.876 --> 01:05:38.856]  Run for school board.
[01:05:38.916 --> 01:05:39.736]  Run for Congress.
[01:05:39.816 --> 01:05:40.536]  Run for governor.
[01:05:40.596 --> 01:05:41.116]  Doesn't matter.
[01:05:41.377 --> 01:05:42.037]  Get involved.
[01:05:42.197 --> 01:05:42.917]  Educate people.
[01:05:42.977 --> 01:05:43.477]  Speak up.
[01:05:44.117 --> 01:05:45.237]  Stand up against them.
[01:05:45.857 --> 01:05:50.018]  And share InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video.
[01:05:50.398 --> 01:05:51.579]  That's why we're still on air.
[01:05:51.979 --> 01:05:53.099]  That's why we're still fighting.
[01:05:53.419 --> 01:05:58.140]  And now we're entering the time when everything we said is coming true and our credibility goes up.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.261]  Like a SpaceX rocket.
[01:06:00.822 --> 01:06:03.384]  So we're going to cover it all on the other side.
[01:06:03.784 --> 01:06:05.205]  Infowars.com.
[01:06:05.505 --> 01:06:06.966]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:11.006]  But the people won't be warned if you don't share the word.
[01:06:11.006 --> 01:06:35.006]  [Music]
[01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:36.925]  Because you're just what I needed.
[01:06:39.165 --> 01:06:41.966]  All of you that have supported this broadcast have changed the world.
[01:06:42.766 --> 01:06:44.847]  It's just all God's work through us.
[01:06:45.727 --> 01:06:47.147]  I guess you're just what I needed.
[01:06:47.427 --> 01:06:48.568]  And I'm just what you needed.
[01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:49.988]  And here we are.
[01:06:51.468 --> 01:06:53.349]  I guess you're just what I needed.
[01:06:56.078 --> 01:06:57.599]  Talking in your sleep.
[01:06:58.299 --> 01:06:59.200]  Talking in your sleep.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.201]  Oh, we gotta turn this off though, it's good.
[01:07:01.221 --> 01:07:03.122]  Doesn't matter where you've been.
[01:07:03.242 --> 01:07:04.383]  As long as it was deep.
[01:07:04.943 --> 01:07:06.544]  As long as it was deep.
[01:07:06.905 --> 01:07:07.405]  Yeah.
[01:07:07.425 --> 01:07:10.707]  Always knew to wear it well.
[01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:12.008]  Alright, we gotta hear this last part.
[01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:14.229]  You look so fancy, I can tell.
[01:07:14.109 --> 01:07:16.109]  I guess you're just what I needed.
[01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:23.109]  [Music]
[01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:25.109]  The Holy Spirit.
[01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:28.109]  [Music]
[01:07:28.982 --> 01:07:31.123]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[01:07:31.143 --> 01:07:33.365]  They say, got milk?
[01:07:33.405 --> 01:07:34.306]  How about got Christ?
[01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:36.347]  Nothing else like it.
[01:07:37.588 --> 01:07:38.449]  They don't want you to have it.
[01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:41.191]  All right, let's get into the serious news here.
[01:07:44.773 --> 01:07:58.207]   Did you ever think about how when there's an earthquake or a volcano or a tornado or a Major storm, dust storm, you name it, wildfires.
[01:07:58.807 --> 01:08:03.969]  You're told without any evidence that it's your fault because you're not paying enough taxes.
[01:08:04.249 --> 01:08:05.390]  Because you've got a car.
[01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:06.650]  Because you've got a swimming pool.
[01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:08.191]  Because you flew on an airplane.
[01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:09.491]  Because you had children.
[01:08:11.412 --> 01:08:17.254]  Because you drank a coffee out of a plastic cup.
[01:08:19.549 --> 01:08:20.970]  And you know, some of that's true.
[01:08:21.211 --> 01:08:23.993]  Things we do are bad for the earth and we should make things cleaner and we've done that.
[01:08:24.393 --> 01:08:27.736]  But hijacking that, 30 years ago was Enron.
[01:08:28.617 --> 01:08:29.338]  Back in the 90s.
[01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:30.439]  Early 90s.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.363]  Coming up with the plan, this was late 80s so it's over 30 years ago, wow.
[01:08:36.424 --> 01:08:45.832]  To put a carbon tax monitoring system on all human activity to control everybody and it's a very destructive tax because it hurts the poorest people.
[01:08:48.976 --> 01:08:52.757]  And so, as soon as I saw yesterday, they said this is the worst tornado in U.S.
[01:08:52.777 --> 01:08:53.097]  history.
[01:08:53.597 --> 01:09:01.319]  I noticed the article on CNN, Total Liars, literally run by pedophiles, wasn't giving any proof.
[01:09:01.339 --> 01:09:02.919]  Someone looked up the history of storms.
[01:09:02.979 --> 01:09:09.421]  It turns out they had one in, what was it, 1914 that killed 200 plus people, and they had a bunch of others that killed over 100.
[01:09:10.501 --> 01:09:14.922]  But this is in the top 10 number of people ever killed by a tornado, group of 10 tornadoes.
[01:09:15.282 --> 01:09:21.169]   And when our populations double what it was 100 years ago, It's surprising it hasn't been 300.
[01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:29.362]  I mean, if they had 200 dying 100 years ago in a storm, this is 130, 140, we're not sure yet, it's still terrible.
[01:09:30.143 --> 01:09:33.549]  Well then, there's more people, there's more spots when a storm forms now to hit it.
[01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:38.415]  So a hundred and something people is not the record storm, it's a lie.
[01:09:38.735 --> 01:09:45.159]  So it just shows you the whole premise of what they're saying is a lie, and they're saying you are to blame.
[01:09:45.199 --> 01:09:46.159]  The president has.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:48.000]  Psaki has come out.
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.001]  I've got the stacks here.
[01:09:49.021 --> 01:09:49.741]  I've got the clips.
[01:09:49.961 --> 01:09:50.642]  You've already seen it.
[01:09:50.662 --> 01:09:54.424]  You don't need me to make you subject you to the puppet president that stole the election.
[01:09:55.344 --> 01:09:56.305]  We're not supposed to say that.
[01:09:57.065 --> 01:09:57.986]  Obviously he stole it.
[01:09:59.392 --> 01:10:04.036]  So now liberals, they're not liberals, they're leftist, control freak, corporate minion criminals.
[01:10:04.277 --> 01:10:09.021]  Liberals use deadly tornadoes to attack Republicans on climate change.
[01:10:09.402 --> 01:10:10.322]  I thought it was warming.
[01:10:11.664 --> 01:10:16.228]  Biden calls on EPA to investigate role of climate crisis in deadly tornadoes.
[01:10:16.248 --> 01:10:16.909]  The London Guardian.
[01:10:17.609 --> 01:10:22.254]  FEMA administrator says extreme weather going to be our new normal because of climate change.
[01:10:23.311 --> 01:10:23.711]  That's right.
[01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:26.392]  People are starving to death, they say, in Africa because of climate change.
[01:10:26.752 --> 01:10:29.334]  Uh, no, it's because there's been years of lockdown starving them to death.
[01:10:29.814 --> 01:10:30.554]  That's actually what's happening.
[01:10:32.595 --> 01:10:36.436]  Biden delivers global warming word salad in bizarre remarks.
[01:10:37.357 --> 01:10:37.917]  But don't worry.
[01:10:37.957 --> 01:10:47.421]  Disgusting California representative and Chinese communist agent Eric Swallowswell takes opportunity after more than 70 dead in Friday's tornado to slam Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.
[01:10:48.321 --> 01:10:48.782]  That's right.
[01:10:48.862 --> 01:10:49.522]  It's his fault.
[01:10:51.082 --> 01:10:52.223]  When he came on the show about that.
[01:10:53.226 --> 01:10:54.928]  He just said Ram Paul doesn't care.
[01:10:54.989 --> 01:10:55.930]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:10:57.332 --> 01:10:58.954]  So this is all voodoo.
[01:10:58.994 --> 01:11:00.276]  This is all mumbo-jumbo.
[01:11:00.316 --> 01:11:01.417]  But let's talk about reality.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:20.566]   When they try to say that you Having a car, having a house, having an air conditioner is bad, but they want you to tax you and track you and control you and they put in the new infrastructure bill that within three years you'll be tracked in live time in your car with a tracker chip that watches and listens to you and breathalyzes you.
[01:11:21.306 --> 01:11:22.547]  This is part of the technocracy.
[01:11:22.587 --> 01:11:25.289]  They admit for the carbon tax tied to the vaccine passport.
[01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:27.210]  This is admitted.
[01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:29.152]  This isn't me 20 years ago telling you now.
[01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:30.333]  This is all confirmed.
[01:11:32.634 --> 01:11:37.877]   But of course, when a cow Pass this gas, or a human does, it changes the climate.
[01:11:38.057 --> 01:11:39.818]  And methane's part of our atmosphere, a good part of it.
[01:11:40.579 --> 01:11:44.162]  And so is carbon dioxide, and so is oxygen, and so is water, and so is sunlight.
[01:11:44.422 --> 01:11:47.325]  Those are the four ingredients of the carbon cycle.
[01:11:47.525 --> 01:11:52.008]  And if they can list that as bad and say that's evil, well, literally, they'll tax you to breathe.
[01:11:55.484 --> 01:12:05.267]  We know that there was a Nobel Prize won in 1992 for chemicals added to jet fuel to create nuclei to block the sun and bounce it back into space.
[01:12:05.567 --> 01:12:10.669]  But you can also spray other nuclei that make the ultraviolet radiation come through and stay in the Earth and greenhouse.
[01:12:11.329 --> 01:12:17.851]  And they admit tens of billions of years spent by the Department of Energy and others in classified programs, manipulating the Earth's weather.
[01:12:18.891 --> 01:12:25.033]  So when we say, hey, you're weather controlling, maybe what you did contributed to this, they say we're conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:26.974 --> 01:12:27.655]  When it's a fact.
[01:12:28.535 --> 01:12:29.616]  But what they do is secret.
[01:12:29.996 --> 01:12:38.703]  But then, when they just pointed us and say, it's your fault, we're supposed to accept that, and if you say it wasn't man-made global warming cause of tornadoes, you get censored on the internet, now official.
[01:12:40.364 --> 01:12:52.321]   But I could play you a hour-long lecture by John Brennan, when he was CIA director, Six years ago, you're about to see part of it, admitting that, oh, other governments don't like what we're doing, it can cause weather problems.
[01:12:52.862 --> 01:12:55.166]  Weather weapons that were developed in the 50s.
[01:12:55.907 --> 01:12:58.512]  I had the father of weather weapons on, Captain Livingston.
[01:12:59.938 --> 01:13:20.023]  So they just think you're stupid, and they don't want you knowing they're doing all this, and they've got carbon systems they're putting in, that big huge geoengineering systems, terraforming systems that are sucking carbon dioxide out of the air when it's a trace gas that we need, and was hundreds of times higher millions of years ago than it is now.
[01:13:20.643 --> 01:13:25.544]  That's why plants and animals were so much bigger and healthier, that we've adapted to live in less air.
[01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:28.002]  This is insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:28.282 --> 01:13:30.724]  Here is Brennan talking about weather modification.
[01:13:30.764 --> 01:13:31.164]  Here it is.
[01:13:33.425 --> 01:13:42.571]  Another example is the array of technologies often referred to collectively as geoengineering that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[01:13:43.592 --> 01:13:56.990]   One that has gained my personal attention Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[01:13:58.191 --> 01:14:08.622]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels.
[01:14:09.735 --> 01:14:11.716]  This process is also relatively inexpensive.
[01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:18.981]  The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly.
[01:14:20.142 --> 01:14:26.706]  As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community.
[01:14:27.677 --> 01:14:41.062]  On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
[01:14:42.242 --> 01:14:54.507]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations.
[01:14:55.586 --> 01:15:01.030]  Others might seize on SAI's benefits and back away from their commitment to carbon dioxide reductions.
[01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:11.517]  And as with other breakthrough technologies, global norms and standards are lacking to guide the deployment and implementation of SAI and other geoengineering initiatives.
[01:15:12.597 --> 01:15:18.198]   And I could go on and on and on and on about the things that fascinate me, but rather than
[01:15:18.198 --> 01:15:20.717]  talk about them, I thought I'd stop here.
[01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:27.917]   Okay, so the question is, did Biden last February, this year, order the power turn off in Texas?
[01:15:27.943 --> 01:15:28.503]  They did officially.
[01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:29.663]  They wouldn't let him up the power.
[01:15:30.323 --> 01:15:31.544]  Now, we know that.
[01:15:31.564 --> 01:15:36.225]  So the question is, did they use weather weapons to cause the tornadoes?
[01:15:36.245 --> 01:15:37.806]  That's a legitimate question to ask.
[01:15:39.446 --> 01:15:46.008]  Pirates, yes they rob I. Sold I to the merchant ships.
[01:15:48.249 --> 01:15:50.450]  Minutes after they took I.
[01:15:55.110 --> 01:16:03.054]  So, there is a $10 billion a year program, Brennan admits it, that's already deployed.
[01:16:03.094 --> 01:16:05.756]  So when he talks to the public about, oh we could deploy it, it's already deployed.
[01:16:06.996 --> 01:16:14.720]  That they used even very primitive versions of against the North Vietnamese that would cause tornadoes, that would cause up to 10 feet of rain on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
[01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:22.913]  And we know that the Air Force was doing weather modification in 1998 in South Texas and killed more than 30 people.
[01:16:22.933 --> 01:16:24.873]  It was even on the news that the Air Force was involved.
[01:16:25.253 --> 01:16:26.534]  They even throw it in our face.
[01:16:28.134 --> 01:16:33.536]  So you just heard Brendan last segment here on the Alex Jones Show, former director of the CIA, at the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:16:33.576 --> 01:16:38.838]  You can just type in councilonforeignrelations.org geoengineering.
[01:16:38.998 --> 01:16:40.259]  Just type that into a search engine.
[01:16:40.599 --> 01:16:46.909]   councilonforeignrelations.org cfr.org Geoengineering.
[01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:52.431]  And you'll see dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens.
[01:16:54.332 --> 01:16:55.932]  You just type it into DuckDuckGo.
[01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:57.573]  Just type it right in right there.
[01:16:57.973 --> 01:16:58.773]  You just type it in.
[01:16:59.453 --> 01:17:00.834]  CFR.org.
[01:17:02.474 --> 01:17:03.555]  Geoengineering.
[01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:10.317]  And you can read that for yourself.
[01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:15.619]  And they talk about the aerosolized programs and all the things they're doing.
[01:17:19.113 --> 01:17:19.853]  And here's another one.
[01:17:20.793 --> 01:17:26.295]  Then we see all these disasters and all these problems, and they say it's our fault while they're up there messing with the weather.
[01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:31.896]  You know, I was told this by engineers, one of which I knew that took me to dinner with more engineers.
[01:17:31.956 --> 01:17:33.117]  He thought I thought he was crazy.
[01:17:35.937 --> 01:17:36.378]  25 years ago.
[01:17:39.558 --> 01:17:41.799]  And they said, listen, we're engineers.
[01:17:41.819 --> 01:17:45.400]  I mean, these were, you know, degreed engineers, successful people.
[01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:51.556]  They said they're putting in Doppler radar, federally funded, at all these cities and towns.
[01:17:51.576 --> 01:17:56.517]  And they said, listen, they're putting power in 5, 10, 20 times, depending on the unit, what is needed for that.
[01:17:57.097 --> 01:18:03.539]  And we've been told that it's really to be able to ionize particulate in the air for weather control.
[01:18:04.059 --> 01:18:10.081]  And then years later, I saw it in mainline news out of Dubai and out of China that they were putting up Doppler radar.
[01:18:10.321 --> 01:18:15.542]  And it said it doubles as Doppler radar, but it also can be powered up to control the weather.
[01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:20.872]  And the UN and all of them are developing it.
[01:18:22.514 --> 01:18:23.074]  Setting it up.
[01:18:23.315 --> 01:18:24.696]  And then they treat you like an animal.
[01:18:24.716 --> 01:18:25.557]  Like a dumb idiot.
[01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:29.722]  And Fauci tells you Santa Claus is real.
[01:18:29.762 --> 01:18:30.443]  He got a shot.
[01:18:30.804 --> 01:18:31.404]  That's not true.
[01:18:31.424 --> 01:18:33.006]  He also tells you the shot protects you.
[01:18:33.026 --> 01:18:33.667]  That's not true.
[01:18:33.987 --> 01:18:36.330]  Just as fake as Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.
[01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:37.672]  Or the Tooth Fairy.
[01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:51.779]  And then when you say, hey, I'm to blame for the tornado, but you're actually doing weather modification, they attack us and say, Jones says Obama sent a tornado to attack Oklahoma City.
[01:18:51.799 --> 01:18:53.000]  Remember that one that killed a bunch of people?
[01:18:54.392 --> 01:18:56.373]  Brennan had just given a speech six years ago.
[01:18:56.713 --> 01:18:57.594]  The tornado hit.
[01:18:57.654 --> 01:18:59.455]  I said, I wonder if that was a weather weapon.
[01:18:59.755 --> 01:19:00.876]  We should have a debate about that.
[01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:01.536]  Don't.
[01:19:01.636 --> 01:19:03.217]  Because they blame global warming again.
[01:19:03.257 --> 01:19:04.098]  They blamed you.
[01:19:04.658 --> 01:19:07.640]  And I just said, hey, probably that happened naturally.
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.600]  That's Tornado Alley.
[01:19:08.801 --> 01:19:10.582]  But they're the ones running around with weather weapons.
[01:19:11.142 --> 01:19:13.263]  They're the ones saying they've got all this and proving they do.
[01:19:13.543 --> 01:19:15.084]  So shouldn't we talk to them?
[01:19:15.965 --> 01:19:19.407]  Oh, Alex Jones claimed Obama sent the tornadoes.
[01:19:21.209 --> 01:19:27.161]  Oh, no, your CIA director just gave speeches about how you can control tornadoes, and I interviewed experts that were involved in all of it, it's true.
[01:19:28.785 --> 01:19:32.272]  So, that's where they are, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what they're doing.
[01:19:33.689 --> 01:19:38.372]  What they can do is take two weather systems that are already coming together and make it way more deadly.
[01:19:38.752 --> 01:19:44.215]  Or they could use these technologies to knock out hurricanes and things they can see coming from a long way away.
[01:19:44.235 --> 01:19:48.397]  It's really hard to deal with things like tornadoes, it's too volatile, but that's why they study it and test it.
[01:19:48.577 --> 01:20:01.424]  But the point is, that's all going on, and the breakaway civilization of the globalists doesn't want us to have an adult discussion about the weather modification, or the global treaties, or the UN laws, or how they've announced global government weather control systems.
[01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:04.420]  If you're a radio listener, you're thinking, wow, that sounds crazy.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:10.185]  TV viewers saw the crew put the CFR documents on television.
[01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:13.188]  On the screen for you to go look it up yourself.
[01:20:13.548 --> 01:20:15.050]  Just like animal-human hybrids.
[01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:16.631]  Just like the pedophile ranks.
[01:20:18.653 --> 01:20:20.995]  These people are in charge.
[01:20:21.075 --> 01:20:22.236]  They're playing God.
[01:20:22.817 --> 01:20:25.039]  And their sacrament is raping children.
[01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:35.467]  They're the last people that should be in charge, but because they're so evil, they have a drive to be in power so they can play God and do whatever they want to you and your family.
[01:20:35.487 --> 01:20:37.808]  And then there's this article from Zero Hedge.
[01:20:38.128 --> 01:20:39.449]  It links to the local news and more.
[01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:44.352]  California has $300 billion in secret money a year.
[01:20:44.853 --> 01:20:46.113]  Now you know why they're so crazy.
[01:20:46.273 --> 01:20:47.294]  They've bought the government off.
[01:20:47.674 --> 01:20:50.456]  That's why even low-level bureaucrats are making $2 million a year.
[01:20:51.116 --> 01:20:53.358]  Even in small towns, city managers, $2 million a year.
[01:20:54.039 --> 01:20:57.161]  Suddenly, people that are making a million a year are living in $5 million houses.
[01:20:57.201 --> 01:20:57.942]  No one knows why.
[01:20:58.242 --> 01:21:01.204]  It's a criminal mafia takeover.
[01:21:01.504 --> 01:21:02.765]  Pedophile story time.
[01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:04.106]  Forced inoculations.
[01:21:04.306 --> 01:21:08.889]  All of it is about them putting their dirty hands on you and playing God.
[01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:17.315]  And this article breaks down how people do FOIA requests and they're told there's $300 billion a year, you don't get to know.
[01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:31.354]   They actually said in the FOIA deal where they charged them $1,250 to even ask the question, The open records request that it's best you don't know, it's quote, for your own good to not know where the 300 billion of your money goes.
[01:21:33.415 --> 01:21:34.555]  And that's not enough for these globals.
[01:21:34.575 --> 01:21:35.656]  They don't want to just steal the money.
[01:21:35.936 --> 01:21:41.378]  They want to devalue it all to plunge things even further because they're going to manage that whole collapse.
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:47.121]  Yeah, these people are terrorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:47.827 --> 01:21:52.731]  They're a big corporate terrorist group with all their aiders and abettors that are in on it and know what happens.
[01:21:52.771 --> 01:21:54.693]  And I learned something years ago that really upset me.
[01:21:55.894 --> 01:21:58.717]  I learned a lot of people that were good tuned in and didn't believe this show.
[01:22:00.118 --> 01:22:05.002]  And a lot of people actually were evil tuned in to learn how stuff worked and use this show to join the globalists.
[01:22:05.783 --> 01:22:14.911]  That's how, wow, you imagine you put the blueprints out to this evil and how they're doing it and a bunch of people have used the show to discover this exists to try to go join it.
[01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:23.052]  My broadcast has been a college for criminals and globalist scum who aspire to higher levels.
[01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:26.314]  It's kind of like the D.A.R.E.
[01:22:26.354 --> 01:22:26.774]  program.
[01:22:26.794 --> 01:22:28.435]  They thought it would help kids not use drugs.
[01:22:28.675 --> 01:22:30.016]  Turned out it actually made them use drugs.
[01:22:31.396 --> 01:22:32.717]  And now, overall, we've done good.
[01:22:32.737 --> 01:22:34.058]  And overall, justice be done.
[01:22:34.078 --> 01:22:34.818]  May the heavens fall.
[01:22:35.098 --> 01:22:35.598]  Tell the truth.
[01:22:35.658 --> 01:22:41.448]   And if somebody uses the truth, you know, of Hey, we got to call the police.
[01:22:41.468 --> 01:22:42.349]  We got to go help somebody.
[01:22:42.369 --> 01:22:44.230]  A car turned over on the road.
[01:22:44.851 --> 01:22:45.731]  And it's crazy.
[01:22:45.791 --> 01:22:47.492]  There's like gold bars on the ground.
[01:22:47.853 --> 01:22:52.576]  And then your neighbor conks you on the head because they don't want to go save the people and not have the gold bars for themselves.
[01:22:52.836 --> 01:22:53.857]  They go steal the gold bars.
[01:22:53.897 --> 01:22:54.797]  That's not my problem.
[01:22:55.578 --> 01:22:58.340]  But what's crazy is good people can't believe all this evil.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.502]  Criminals hear it and go out and find out it's true and join with it.
[01:23:04.985 --> 01:23:08.287]  And now the whole thing's coming to an end.
[01:23:10.168 --> 01:23:13.229]  And these psychos have created a collapse they're never going to get out of.
[01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:17.389]  You know, I forgot to ask, who's hosting Sunday Live tonight?
[01:23:18.409 --> 01:23:20.670]  I know that Owen was up in Dallas for that big event.
[01:23:20.690 --> 01:23:21.310]  I apologize.
[01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:22.650]  I had so much family stuff come up.
[01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.670]  I didn't go.
[01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:25.071]  Over 10,000 people were there.
[01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:26.351]  I heard it was just incredible.
[01:23:27.331 --> 01:23:28.711]  But Owen's going to be there.
[01:23:28.731 --> 01:23:29.951]  I'll go to some more of those big events.
[01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.332]  I went to one in San Antonio a month ago.
[01:23:31.692 --> 01:23:32.252]  It was amazing.
[01:23:32.452 --> 01:23:33.072]  5,000 people.
[01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:35.412]  But I just was unable to go.
[01:23:35.472 --> 01:23:37.813]  But I apologize to all the listeners that went up there.
[01:23:40.086 --> 01:23:43.928]  So Harrison Smith, host of American Journal, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:23:44.569 --> 01:23:47.791]  at InfoWars.com and on radio stations and TV stations across the country to pick it up.
[01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:53.494]  He's going to be hosting two hours of Sunday Live that only has six minutes of ads an hour for local stations.
[01:23:54.074 --> 01:23:56.236]  No network ads.
[01:23:56.836 --> 01:24:03.600]  Six minutes an hour for local stations that want a really powerful Sunday night show hosted by Owen Schroer, myself.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:13.347]  And sometimes, and then Christy Lee and Harrison Smith, we all rotate through that show because it's important to be here seven days a week.
[01:24:13.767 --> 01:24:15.449]  I was here, of course, on Saturday as well.
[01:24:16.029 --> 01:24:17.070]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:19.732]  I'm just saying I'm committed and I'm in this fight.
[01:24:20.012 --> 01:24:22.394]  And in the new year, I'm going to start weeknight shows.
[01:24:24.016 --> 01:24:25.036]  And I'm going to do so much more.
[01:24:25.797 --> 01:24:28.019]  And the more they try to silence us, the more I'm going to fight back.
[01:24:28.039 --> 01:24:29.440]  But that's not the main reason I fight so hard.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.981]  We're being vindicated.
[01:24:31.041 --> 01:24:31.782]  This is our time.
[01:24:32.685 --> 01:24:34.046]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:24:34.506 --> 01:24:36.568]  Everything we did was to get us to this point.
[01:24:36.948 --> 01:24:42.272]  And like any long 12-round heavyweight boxing match, it's those last few rounds where you've got to just turn it on.
[01:24:42.292 --> 01:24:46.115]  You've got to dig down there to the energy you didn't know you had and just turn it loose.
[01:24:47.036 --> 01:24:49.718]  And, you know, instead, I've hit my second wind.
[01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:54.041]  I feel energized and just absolutely empowered because of your prayer.
[01:24:55.706 --> 01:25:02.649]  So out of everything you do, please continue to pray for InfoWars, please continue to spread the word about the links, and please tell people about your local AM and FM stations and support them.
[01:25:03.976 --> 01:25:08.360]  And whenever you do, share the articles and videos, because that's how we reach all these new people that are so hungry for the truth.
[01:25:08.721 --> 01:25:15.167]  And then tell them, if you found this to be informative, share it with others, and then tell them to share it with others, and tell them to share it with others.
[01:25:15.447 --> 01:25:16.108]  Pass it on.
[01:25:16.148 --> 01:25:17.289]  Hey, here's the link.
[01:25:17.349 --> 01:25:18.010]  Pass it on.
[01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:19.031]  Let's save the country.
[01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:20.252]  Let's save the world.
[01:25:20.573 --> 01:25:24.757]  This guy was way ahead of the curve, you know, and we can get ahead of the curve.
[01:25:24.797 --> 01:25:25.778]  We can beat this together.
[01:25:26.258 --> 01:25:28.740]  Separately, it'll sell out by tomorrow morning, if not tonight.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:31.522]  The 1776 coins at infowarestore.com.

[01:26:16.249 --> 01:26:20.872]  Alex Jones here to make a very important announcement to our amazing listeners and viewers.
[01:26:21.452 --> 01:26:26.175]  We have produced a limited run of something very, very special.
[01:26:26.755 --> 01:26:29.957]  It's the 1776 Founder Coin.
[01:26:30.577 --> 01:26:32.058]  You've got to see this coin for yourself.
[01:26:32.419 --> 01:26:35.781]  It's at 1776coin.com.
[01:26:36.201 --> 01:26:39.363]  And this coin makes you a founding member.
[01:26:40.143 --> 01:26:45.105]  of a very exciting group of projects that we're going to be launching in the very near future.
[01:26:45.425 --> 01:26:47.486]  Become a founding member today.
[01:26:47.926 --> 01:26:55.129]  Learn more at 1776coin.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:26:55.509 --> 01:27:01.872]  As a founding member, you become part of an elite circle continuing the fight against the globalist New World Order.
[01:27:02.452 --> 01:27:04.513]  That's why you're called a founding member.
[01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:15.400]  Because the funding from this is going to go towards launching these new independent systems that will empower the American people to take free speech in the face of censoring tyrants to the next level.
[01:27:18.331 --> 01:27:18.952]  Get our grape.
[01:27:18.972 --> 01:27:20.092]  Got a bag of it here.
[01:27:20.493 --> 01:27:23.975]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico?
[01:27:23.995 --> 01:27:24.776]  The communists!
[01:27:25.076 --> 01:27:32.301]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:37.665]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune and whatever.
[01:27:37.705 --> 01:27:42.409]  The point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[01:27:42.429 --> 01:27:46.772]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[01:27:46.852 --> 01:27:53.534]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:27:53.654 --> 01:27:57.115]  It's Wake Up America Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[01:27:57.836 --> 01:28:00.836]  Um, in fact, I'm not gonna tell you the whole story.
[01:28:00.936 --> 01:28:03.437]  Um... Yeah, I don't like that.
[01:28:04.158 --> 01:28:05.198]  Okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[01:28:05.218 --> 01:28:11.600]  Anyway, so, it's infowarestore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't fund us or don't want us here, that's fine.
