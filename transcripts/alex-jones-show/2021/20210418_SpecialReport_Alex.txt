[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:00.809]  Shootings?
[00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.550]  Gun laws?
[00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.371]  Access to weapons?
[00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:04.771]  Oh yeah, I know when they'll change.
[00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:07.212]  Your kids start getting killed?
[00:00:08.393 --> 00:00:10.114]  White people's kids start getting killed?
[00:00:12.215 --> 00:00:18.778]  Smoking that doobie that's actually legal, probably, in your state now, but they don't know what it was, and then the kid runs, and then pop, pop, pop, pop!
[00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:21.379]  Cop was justified.
[00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:21.939]  Why'd you run?
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.480]  Oh, we had a baseball game tonight.
[00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:25.041]  Huh.
[00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:26.061]  White kid.
[00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:26.742]  Oh, big family.
[00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:27.502]  That house over there?
[00:00:29.653 --> 00:00:30.634]  Those start piling up?
[00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:34.117]  What is going on with these police?
[00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.200]  Maybe we shouldn't even have police!
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.741]  That kind of mania?
[00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:41.422]  That kind of madness?
[00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:42.763]  That'll be you!
[00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:44.885]  We've got to stay in the street.
[00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:48.108]  And we've got to demand justice.
[00:00:48.228 --> 00:00:53.112]  We've got to not only stay in the street, but we've got to fight for justice.
[00:00:53.472 --> 00:00:58.156]  But I am very hopeful, and I hope that we're going to get
[00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:00.677]  We're ready to face the number.
[00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:01.417]  We've had this.
[00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:30.945]  The problem was that the refugee model was working on a crisis that ended up on the border with Yonkees.
[00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:37.014]  What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed.
[00:01:37.435 --> 00:01:42.096]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:44.097]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[00:01:44.377 --> 00:01:45.337]  They deserve to be heard.
[00:01:45.357 --> 00:01:46.217]  That's who we are.
[00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:50.439]  We're a nation that says if you want to flee and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.901]  Alex Jones here with some good news and then some bad news.
[00:01:58.206 --> 00:02:05.530]  We have brought to bear a lot of pressure, a lot of coverage down at the Texas-Mexico border here in McAllen and other areas in the last few weeks.
[00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:07.451]  So has Senator Cruz and others.
[00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:12.955]  But it's been InfoWars reporting that has really pushed over the edge into public consciousness.
[00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:18.057]  It's been you, the listeners and viewers, that have really been sharing the articles, sharing the videos.
[00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:19.218]  They're going viral everywhere.
[00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:20.679]  So I really commend you.
[00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.521]  Also, a lot of folks are following our suggestion
[00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:31.938]  To take the footage off Banned.Video out of the border crisis section and to just blow it up, cut our bugs off, use it however you want, we don't need the attention.
[00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:38.080]  They ban a lot of people or restrict stuff if you give InfoWars.com attention or Banned.Video.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.901]  So we don't care about the credit, just get the videos.
[00:02:41.926 --> 00:02:46.389]  If I'm in any of them, cut me out or anything that's identifiable and just get the information out.
[00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:52.152]  This is about saving the country, saving the world and not letting the UN destroy the country via replacement migration.
[00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:55.854]  But you have been kicking butt and it is incredible.
[00:02:56.034 --> 00:02:56.755]  So keep it up.
[00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:58.436]  Now, let me give you the good news.
[00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:03.479]  Biden, as you know, or probably know, last night came out and said, yes, there is now a border crisis.
[00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.196]  And it's basically of his own doing.
[00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:08.617]  And he said, but the people aren't coming because I'm a nice guy.
[00:03:08.637 --> 00:03:10.918]  Even though when they ask him, they say, Biden said come.
[00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:11.838]  He said surge the border.
[00:03:12.238 --> 00:03:12.998]  He's a nice guy.
[00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.440]  That's where the talking point in the press conference is.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.620]  You're such a nice guy.
[00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.400]  That's why they're coming.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.981]  Isn't that right?
[00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:22.683]  These are smugglers bringing them up here who hand them over to the border patrol.
[00:03:23.123 --> 00:03:24.183]  Many of them are kidnapped.
[00:03:24.664 --> 00:03:27.465]  Many of them are coming from China and the Middle East and Africa.
[00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:28.345]  Many of them are criminals.
[00:03:28.685 --> 00:03:29.726]  Many of them are terrorists.
[00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:40.656]  How can we have checkpoints inside the country and they want us to have these virus passports and all this crap to go to a football game, but then the border's wide open?
[00:03:41.056 --> 00:03:42.238]  This is a fraud.
[00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:50.366]  And the same UN border organizations and NGOs that busted Europe wide open are the very groups running it here.
[00:03:50.426 --> 00:03:53.088]  Gregg Reese did a great report on it in the border crisis section.
[00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:54.687]  I don't know.
[00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:25.561]  Now it's all being forced out in the open and Congressman Biggs and others have come out and shown the evidence, shown the documentation that this is completing the smuggling routes and that now the Biden administration, the border patrol, the FBI are, and the whole federal government now are facilitators for the worldwide cartels and for the United Nations refugee program that Trump pulled us out of.
[00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:32.515]  Three, four years ago that now Biden's put us back under where the UN directs who we accept, who we take in.
[00:04:32.535 --> 00:04:33.576]  This is incredible.
[00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:37.859]  More video we got yesterday of nothing but pregnant women getting off buses here.
[00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:47.786]  And they'll have another bus with nothing but little kids on it or another bus or van with nothing but unaccompanied babies that have nurse made women who picked them up at the border where they were just thrown over the fence.
[00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:52.550]  And then they just disappear to these groups that aren't even on record who they are.
[00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:55.826]  This is to facilitate smuggling.
[00:04:55.886 --> 00:04:57.267]  Remember the Senate report six years ago?
[00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:04.756]  Obama knowingly gave small children to traffickers, including human smugglers involved in the sex trade.
[00:05:06.152 --> 00:05:09.955]  I can't even believe how naked and open and evil this is, that they think they're going to get away with it.
[00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:11.796]  But they're not, because we're going to expose it.
[00:05:11.836 --> 00:05:16.120]  These globalist criminals are testing to see what we will put up with.
[00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:24.126]  But good job everybody spreading the word, because now they've gone from denying this crisis is happening, to denying they're behind it, to now having major, major pressure on them.
[00:05:24.186 --> 00:05:26.208]  And it's really waking America up.
[00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:27.108]  This is about globalism.
[00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:28.469]  It's about breaking the country wide open.
[00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:30.091]  Now let me shift gears to the bad news.
[00:05:31.052 --> 00:05:41.797]  There's a talking point by Maxine Waters who visited Minnesota last night and basically called for violence and tried to meddle in the trial of Chauvin and the whole George Floyd tragedy.
[00:05:42.758 --> 00:05:51.822]  And she's trying to distract away from all the fentanyl deaths and the tens of thousands of blacks that kill each other every year in places like Chicago and areas out in California and her district as well.
[00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:55.335]  And it's trying to say that whites are inherently racist.
[00:05:55.836 --> 00:06:03.781]  She's the one that said, go harass Republican voters, go harass Trump supporters at gas stations, at restaurants, in shops, and you've seen all the violence.
[00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:09.524]  And then now we have Cuomo, whose evil brother runs New York and all the corruption there.
[00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:15.508]  We now have Cuomo on CNN saying, white kids are going to have to die before we get police reform.
[00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.451]  Well, four times as many young white people died at the hands of police than blacks.
[00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:24.514]  If you're a white adult per capita, you're more than twice as likely to be shot by police.
[00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:25.375]  That's per capita.
[00:06:25.755 --> 00:06:29.298]  If there's 100 white people and 100 black people, you're twice as likely.
[00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.300]  Four times if you're a white youth.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.562]  The cops slow roll the black neighborhoods.
[00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:34.502]  They don't even really respond.
[00:06:34.943 --> 00:06:36.644]  It's one reason there's so much crime and so much death.
[00:06:36.924 --> 00:06:38.125]  It's because they're afraid to enforce.
[00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:49.234]  The idea that police want to, in the middle of a riot, pull a gun instead of a taser, and then shoot an innocent person who was a subject of an armed robbery investigation and was in the middle of a riot,
[00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:57.259]  It's still you're going to have a tragedy when Pelosi and Cuomo and all these others throw gasoline on a fire.
[00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:04.083]  They were an explosion to divert from the big banks and the big corporations looting America and destroying this country.
[00:07:04.143 --> 00:07:05.844]  It's in the WikiLeaks that it's divide.
[00:07:06.707 --> 00:07:07.327]  And it's conquer.
[00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:12.731]  It's all Americans, whether you're old, young, black or white, it doesn't matter, that are under globalist attack.
[00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:14.833]  We're the ones being given experimental vaccines.
[00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:16.474]  We're the ones having our jobs shipped overseas.
[00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:19.936]  We're the ones being turned against each other by the corporate media.
[00:07:20.497 --> 00:07:22.978]  It was in WikiLeaks six years ago, five and a half years ago.
[00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:24.579]  Hillary's like, I'm losing, what am I gonna do?
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.022]  And these top professors tell her, go to race war, go to culture war, it's your only hope.
[00:07:29.603 --> 00:07:32.465]  And so Hollywood and all these people are dividing us.
[00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:33.806]  Can you imagine if I went on air?
[00:07:35.117 --> 00:07:35.357]  I don't
[00:07:53.683 --> 00:07:55.264]  Minnesota covering it.
[00:07:55.284 --> 00:08:01.608]  Can you imagine with Maxine there, who said that people that walked between the velvet ropes at the Capitol were terrorists?
[00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:02.569]  Remember her?
[00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:06.952]  People that walked between the velvet ropes were terrorists.
[00:08:08.052 --> 00:08:08.513]  They all need
[00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:31.955]  They have all the academia, they have all the big banks, all the big corporations, almost all the cities are blue because of election fraud.
[00:08:32.296 --> 00:08:42.083]  They have the EU on their side, all of it, Hollywood, you name it, all hating America, all saying guns and private property and Christianity and pro-life is bad.
[00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:42.764]  They're bullies.
[00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.505]  They gang up on unborn babies.
[00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:46.146]  They want to euthanize old people.
[00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:47.147]  They're scum.
[00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:54.293]  And they use race to divide us because they know that that is the way to balkanize us and control us.
[00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:55.294]  And it's just...
[00:08:56.482 --> 00:08:56.963]  That simple.
[00:08:57.123 --> 00:08:58.145]  Now going back to Biden.
[00:08:58.506 --> 00:08:59.507]  He just came out in Houston.
[00:08:59.527 --> 00:09:05.097]  They had to close one of these whole facilities with girls, 13 to 17, because somebody got stabbed to death and killed.
[00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:06.940]  They've had a bunch of rapes going on.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.721]  It's total bedlam.
[00:09:08.888 --> 00:09:12.993]  Half the damn hotels in Texas I go to are closed and full of, quote, migrants.
[00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:15.035]  This is a full-on invasion.
[00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:18.399]  And again, for everybody signing onto this on the left, you are insane.
[00:09:18.659 --> 00:09:21.683]  You're destroying your own self and your country in this process.
[00:09:22.203 --> 00:09:26.228]  China doesn't allow any of this in their country, but they direct what's happened to us through the media.
[00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:28.130]  So again, the big media.
[00:09:28.991 --> 00:09:35.554]  Communist China, the EU, Hollywood, radical Islam, it's all ganged up with big tech censoring the American people.
[00:09:36.094 --> 00:09:42.436]  But the people are waking up thanks to Tucker Carlson and even Bill Maher has come out and said that COVID is an overblown fraud and a power grab.
[00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:46.598]  So in the end, we're going to win folks, but stop submitting, stop complying.
[00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:50.661]  Mark Twain famously said that a lie makes it halfway around the world before truth puts its pants on.
[00:10:06.621 --> 00:10:06.961]  It's true.
[00:10:07.361 --> 00:10:10.323]  But in the beginning, a patriot, scarce man, hated, feared, scorned.
[00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:14.004]  And in time, when his cause succeeds, a timid joined him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:10:14.465 --> 00:10:15.865]  And that's where we all stand together.
[00:10:15.965 --> 00:10:17.466]  So we're going to win this together.
[00:10:17.906 --> 00:10:21.048]  But realize it's an information war, and the key ingredient is God.
[00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:23.769]  The key ingredient is overriding the globalist.
[00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:30.572]  The key ingredient is coming together and understanding the Great Reset is anti-human, period.
[00:10:30.812 --> 00:10:34.474]  And we have our differences, but at the end of the day, the globalists are the big enemy.
[00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:44.001]  So again, override the censorship, spread this link, share the article, share the live feeds, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:10:44.661 --> 00:10:53.663]  And today, 4 to 8 p.m., you're gonna have Robert Barnes, Owen Schroer, myself and others, all co-hosting an amazing four-hour live transmission.
[00:10:54.343 --> 00:10:58.744]  So if you're watching this transmission, please spread the word because you are the resistance.
[00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.151]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:09.573]  The British ended up being the most powerful empire in the world.
[00:11:09.713 --> 00:11:11.134]  Not because the Spanish couldn't fight.
[00:11:11.214 --> 00:11:12.754]  Not because the Portuguese couldn't fight.
[00:11:12.854 --> 00:11:15.375]  Not because the Austrian-Hungarian Empire couldn't fight.
[00:11:15.435 --> 00:11:17.616]  You ever wonder why British are called limeys?
[00:11:17.957 --> 00:11:20.318]  The British ended up getting basically key limes.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:31.402]  When they went into the Caribbean 500 years ago, and they had their captains right, and their ship's doctors, how long sailors survived, what climates, they were trying to figure out what's making sickness.
[00:11:31.422 --> 00:11:34.543]  They weren't sure if it was hot air, or why they got close to the shore.
[00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:36.403]  More of their sailors would die in a couple days.
[00:11:36.523 --> 00:11:38.263]  And they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitoes.
[00:11:38.423 --> 00:11:40.884]  But the British classified that 400 years ago.
[00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:42.724]  So the British would always lay off the coast.
[00:11:42.964 --> 00:11:45.565]  And foreigners would ask, why did the Brits lay off the coast?
[00:11:45.585 --> 00:11:46.405]  Because they don't want mosquitoes.
[00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:50.067]  The fevers, the malaria, the cangling mosquitoes.
[00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:52.848]  The Brits also figured out with their scientists, limes.
[00:11:53.048 --> 00:11:54.689]  But the Brits were suspicious.
[00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:56.591]  The average sailor thought if you swim you get sick.
[00:11:56.631 --> 00:11:59.172]  And they thought, you know, you don't want to eat vegetables, they make you sick.
[00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:00.913]  This is what people actually thought back then.
[00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:04.856]  So they would put the limes in the grog.
[00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:06.177]  Which is, what's grog?
[00:12:06.297 --> 00:12:07.658]  One-third rum, two-thirds water.
[00:12:07.898 --> 00:12:09.259]  To make sure they would at least drink their water.
[00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:12.621]  Part of their pay in their daily ration for good behavior was grog.
[00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:17.825]  So on the job, all sailors, Spanish, Russian, it didn't matter, they were paid in alcohol.
[00:12:17.965 --> 00:12:19.586]  And part of their daily food was alcohol.
[00:12:19.646 --> 00:12:24.790]  So the British would start putting, 400 years ago, limes in the alcohol, the grog.
[00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.754]  And so, what would happen when they were a thousand miles from home and ran up against a Spanish frigate twice their size?
[00:12:30.914 --> 00:12:32.936]  Well, the Spanish, all their teeth had fallen out.
[00:12:33.056 --> 00:12:34.317]  They had cuts all over them.
[00:12:34.497 --> 00:12:36.278]  Open wounds.
[00:12:36.458 --> 00:12:37.539]  No fresh vegetables.
[00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:51.247]  No vitamin C. Well, notice the British for 200 years could keep it secret that limes were... And so it was a joke to all the other armies that there were bags of limes and obsessions with limes and powdered lime powder to put in.
[00:12:51.527 --> 00:12:57.571]  And they would put it in the grog to make them drink it because they knew our troops are ready to fight.
[00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:01.355]  Because they've got vitamin C. So I'm going into a plug here, but here's the deal.
[00:13:01.555 --> 00:13:08.863]  Every study, Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes for vitamin C. And now if you have mega dosages of it, you basically never get cancer.
[00:13:08.883 --> 00:13:10.345]  So these are the things that are known.
[00:13:10.485 --> 00:13:14.149]  If you think vitamin C is powerful, the stuff at DNA Force is even beyond that.
[00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:15.631]  It's the next level of that.
[00:13:15.831 --> 00:13:16.592]  That's what we know.
[00:13:16.612 --> 00:13:21.334]  And when your body doesn't have the good halogen of iodine, it uses the bad halogen.
[00:13:21.494 --> 00:13:24.776]  And at a certain point, the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive.
[00:13:25.016 --> 00:13:28.078]  They start mutating so they can use that and not die.
[00:13:28.438 --> 00:13:31.120]  But then they take over your body and you die from cancer.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:38.644]  And so, so much of the deformity and the mental illness and the low IQs and everything is that people have vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[00:13:38.824 --> 00:13:40.986]  And they work around the clock with all these fake reports.
[00:13:41.126 --> 00:13:45.168]  Oh, you don't need vitamins, you don't need minerals, you don't need... And they lower the amount you're supposed to take.
[00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:48.150]  They know exactly what they're doing.
