[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:09.099]  There is no bad guy left, at least in Massachusetts, to point the finger at, turn the screws on, and break their will so they stop emitting.
[00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.880]  That's you.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.961]  We have to break your will.
[00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:13.744]  I can't even say that publicly.
[00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:14.485]  What I'm trying to say is...
[00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:34.300]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:43.806]  Everything we cover is extremely important and we drop a lot of huge bombshells daily on my weekday broadcast.
[00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:50.151]  InfoWars.com is one of the most hardcore, cutting-edge news organizations in the world.
[00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:55.194]  We're fearless and we have broken thousands of stories before anybody else.
[00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.017]  So it's kind of hard for me to
[00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:10.981]  Highlight stories like this and say they're particularly important when everything we cover is important, but the four groups of stories I'm about to cover tied together are just incredible.
[00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:16.163]  And I was already making these parallels in my own mind thinking about this last night.
[00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:22.984]  And when I got up, I noticed that other researchers and other writers had also made the same connections.
[00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:27.505]  So let me just tell you what we're about to break down right now, because this is over the top important.
[00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:34.374]  We have a Zoom meeting of the climate czar in Massachusetts saying, don't let this get out.
[00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:41.657]  But we're trying to break the will of the American people with the carbon tax, with the lockdown.
[00:01:41.677 --> 00:01:44.419]  We're going to show you that video first in a moment.
[00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.423]  That then ties into the larger agenda and this incredible confession, you know, super villains love to brag out of Time Magazine.
[00:01:55.694 --> 00:02:06.342]  That came out yesterday where they admit to a secret cabal of private international corporate money manipulating the 2020 election to stop Trump from winning.
[00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:08.723]  Why would they brag about this?
[00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:10.084]  Because they know it's all coming out.
[00:02:10.545 --> 00:02:13.527]  They're trying to put their spin on it that it was legal and lawful.
[00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:19.491]  That then ties into news that broke just last night.
[00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:23.394]  Senior anti-Marjorie Greene Republican staffer
[00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:42.775]  Now on Thursday, I read out of some of the German police reports, Italian, US, and Russian police reports about these groups, and listeners could not believe it until they looked it up.
[00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:50.477]  I'm going to try to take it easy on you and not read all this, but it deals with raping one-year-old babies.
[00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:52.397]  Groups of men gang raping babies.
[00:02:54.906 --> 00:02:56.667]  People thought I was kidding on Thursday.
[00:02:58.168 --> 00:03:01.670]  He was organizing gang rape of babies.
[00:03:04.732 --> 00:03:07.674]  That then ties into just this stack from Thursday.
[00:03:07.734 --> 00:03:14.039]  I went back and dug into the stack from Thursday of DW.EU, Top German TV, all of it.
[00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:20.443]  The government in every German state with the Catholic Church running giant
[00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:24.995]  Child brothels with children as young as five.
[00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:31.300]  Again, men gang raping little boys, particularly, until they got hospitalized.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.225]  And when they got hospitalized, the nuns would then take them to torture dungeons to punish them for not being tough.
[00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:39.406]  So I want you to understand something.
[00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:41.988]  They've taken over both the major political parties here.
[00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.530]  They've got control of Attica.
[00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.631]  They've got control of Hollywood.
[00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:50.105]  I was told out in Hollywood when they were starting to put me in some big movies that pedophilia ran Hollywood.
[00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:50.725]  I got out of it.
[00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:51.686]  I got out of Hollywood.
[00:03:51.706 --> 00:03:52.506]  I don't want to be any part of it.
[00:03:53.087 --> 00:03:53.827]  Had a horrible feeling.
[00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:54.608]  The whole place is creepy.
[00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.390]  But you have to understand, big tech is heavily involved in this.
[00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.151]  This is a cult.
[00:04:00.912 --> 00:04:02.252]  And this is how they recruit people.
[00:04:02.312 --> 00:04:05.955]  Jeffrey Epstein was nothing but a high-level pimp.
[00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:12.499]  Think of him as a Mater D that works at the Waldorf Astoria hotel chain.
[00:04:13.404 --> 00:04:14.824]  There are a lot of Waldorf Astorias.
[00:04:14.884 --> 00:04:16.084]  This is a hypothetical.
[00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.085]  It's an allegory, an analogy.
[00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:26.226]  And he's at the most popular, and he's a celebrated maitre d', because of the restaurant and the quality of the children.
[00:04:26.946 --> 00:04:27.186]  Okay?
[00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:29.027]  So that's all he was, was a pimp.
[00:04:29.707 --> 00:04:31.247]  There are many Waldorf Astorias.
[00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:36.148]  There are many maitre d's that work at Waldorf Astorias.
[00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:41.909]  Just as there are many Jeffrey Epsteins that run large child brothels.
[00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:43.331]  I don't know.
[00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:01.099]  We're good.
[00:05:20.117 --> 00:05:21.118]  That's what makes them tick.
[00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.322]  And all of this is about breaking your will.
[00:05:24.803 --> 00:05:26.065]  It's a spiritual action.
[00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:35.056]  These psychopaths, when they're torturing men, women, and children to death, call it sucking somebody dry, or watching them give up, or breaking their will.
[00:05:35.777 --> 00:05:39.419]  I've read about famous cases again in Texas Monthly decades ago.
[00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:03.233]  Other publications about when the Mexican mafia groups were unable to break somebody's will, they would usually commit suicide afterwards.
[00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:09.315]  They were so upset that after, in some cases, weeks of torturing someone, if they couldn't break them, they would then kill themselves.
[00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:11.396]  So you have to understand, this is all about will.
[00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:13.397]  Some people like to torture men to death.
[00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:15.478]  Others like to torture women to death.
[00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.059]  But that's a subgroup.
[00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.882]  The dominant cult of this type of black magic, and that's what it is, it's energy vampirism,
[00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:25.856]  is the torturing of the children.
[00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:32.579]  That's the main cult group, but you can research MS-13 to become a maid member, not an outer member.
[00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.841]  You've got to grab a little girl and torture her to death in a satanic ritual.
[00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:42.624]  This is across the system, ladies and gentlemen, and it's going on in every country, and it's bound together by Satan.
[00:06:43.105 --> 00:06:43.705]  This is real.
[00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:46.204]  Well, police still don't know the victim's name.
[00:06:46.244 --> 00:06:50.447]  She is a teenager, allegedly murdered because she insulted Satan.
[00:06:50.928 --> 00:06:56.452]  Her accused killers, members of a notorious street gang that in recent months seem to have grown even more violent.
[00:06:56.752 --> 00:07:04.918]  The case against Miguel Angel Alvarez Flores and Diego Alexander Hernandez Rivera rests on the testimony of a teenage girl.
[00:07:05.278 --> 00:07:09.981]  A girl police say was abducted, raped, and then held as a prisoner by the MS-13 street gang.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.241]  Now again, all these stories tie together
[00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.332]  Let's look at the first one right now.
[00:07:43.153 --> 00:07:45.014]  Let me introduce to you David Ismay.
[00:07:45.034 --> 00:07:46.635]  Before I read his bio, I knew what I'd be reading.
[00:07:46.655 --> 00:07:47.476]  He is a military soldier.
[00:07:47.496 --> 00:07:48.537]  He is an operative.
[00:07:48.577 --> 00:07:49.377]  He is a feudal lord.
[00:08:10.543 --> 00:08:12.044]  He is a king in the making.
[00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:18.507]  He is prosecuting a war of serfdom and feudalism against the American people.
[00:08:19.727 --> 00:08:27.331]  But most importantly, you have to remember, he is trying to break your will.
[00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:31.413]  We're going to play that clip in a moment, but first let's look at his pedigree.
[00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:34.735]  They're always the same.
[00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:39.517]  This is the climate czar in Massachusetts where no industry is basically
[00:08:40.788 --> 00:08:41.128]  Allowed.
[00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:50.473]  United States Naval Academy, Oxford University, Rhodes Scholar, Cecil Rhodes Globalist, and the University of California Berkeley School of Law.
[00:08:51.033 --> 00:09:08.582]  He then goes into Navy Special Warfare, Navy SEALs, an officer, and then it goes on from there working at top globalist Rothschild Rockefeller controlled operations to bring in global carbon taxes and to build an international
[00:09:10.086 --> 00:09:11.066]  World Government System.
[00:09:12.246 --> 00:09:13.547]  And then, of course, he worked at U.S.
[00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:18.028]  Deep Decarbonization, We Are Carbon, project.
[00:09:18.668 --> 00:09:25.549]  And then he moved to be the head undersecretary of Climate Change, Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
[00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.551]  Here he is in a linked Zoom call saying, don't let this information get out.
[00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:33.951]  But our target isn't the big airlines.
[00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:35.752]  Our target isn't the big companies.
[00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:36.632]  They're all exempt.
[00:09:37.642 --> 00:09:40.484]  The target is the old retiree down the street.
[00:09:41.004 --> 00:09:47.928]  The target is the population because when they heat their homes or they have a car, that's evil because carbon dioxide is bad.
[00:09:47.948 --> 00:09:51.110]  And of course, that's all based on junk science.
[00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.790]  It's all a scam.
[00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.951]  But they're not really even trying to reduce carbon.
[00:09:53.991 --> 00:10:05.558]  They want to tax every bit of it as a new global currency they control and then have international Agenda 21, Agenda 2030 zoning over every single facet
[00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.632]  of your life with U.N.
[00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:11.454]  regulators, just like you have contact tracers that are U.N.
[00:10:11.474 --> 00:10:15.818]  controlled with COVID-19, in your life controlling every aspect of it.
[00:10:16.599 --> 00:10:32.794]  Shutting down small farms, shutting down small businesses, inspecting your house, huge fines, huge regulations to again break your will so that you will give up your private home, so that you will give up your private business and move into a compact high-rise
[00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:35.255]  250 square foot coffin apartment.
[00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:37.956]  This is the admitted battle plan of these people.
[00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:51.001]  You know, one thing that we found through our analysis is that 60% of our emissions come from, as I have been starting to say, you and me, except you guys are in Vermont.
[00:10:51.021 --> 00:10:57.004]  60% of our emissions come from residential heating and passenger vehicles.
[00:10:57.204 --> 00:10:57.904]  So let me say that again.
[00:10:57.924 --> 00:11:02.806]  60% of our emissions that need to be reduced come from
[00:11:04.258 --> 00:11:09.361]  The founder and head of the Davos Group, Klaus Schwab, also headed up for many years the UN Sustainability Project.
[00:11:34.674 --> 00:11:47.508]  Again, that says no single family dwelling homes, it says no clearing of the land anywhere, no having fireplaces, no having space heaters, no having oil, no having gas, no having coal.
[00:11:48.188 --> 00:11:53.434]  Without that, you have about half a billion people die a year, they estimate, for more than a decade.
[00:11:53.734 --> 00:11:55.216]  A total collapse of civilization.
[00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:56.277]  But again,
[00:11:56.604 --> 00:12:07.012]  The Great Reset wasn't happening fast enough, so now Klaus Schwab says any business or company where you have close proximity to people will never be allowed.
[00:12:07.132 --> 00:12:07.932]  It's going to be phased out.
[00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:09.774]  We will permanently wear masks.
[00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:12.356]  We will permanently no longer shake hands.
[00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:25.946]  He and Fauci have said that, and they've said, don't worry, humans are obsolete, but as we phase out humans, robots will deliver everything to you, and you will own nothing, you will have nothing, and you will like it.
[00:12:30.162 --> 00:12:30.243]  Yeah.
[00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:28.404]  We know that many industries which rely particularly on physical interaction
[00:13:29.073 --> 00:13:29.393]  I think?
[00:13:51.636 --> 00:13:59.360]  Bouncing the sun off of the atmosphere, and so we're going to call to tax carbon to stop the new ice age.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:12.086]  But then as things heated up a little bit, because they don't control the climate yet, they're trying, with all the geoengineering that Bill Gates has announced and others have been announcing, that they would then say that it was global warming and say that it was carbon.
[00:14:12.606 --> 00:14:20.250]  So that any carbon emission, including trees that put off carbon dioxide, need to be cut down and buried
[00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:22.209]  I'm not kidding.
[00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:22.630]  Look it up.
[00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.312]  Cut trees down to stop carbon.
[00:14:25.752 --> 00:14:29.415]  So it's this irrational religion that carbon is bad.
[00:14:29.896 --> 00:14:34.700]  And then you've got to go to the IMF, the World Bank, the Gore and Blood Group.
[00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.329]  I'm not joking, that's the name of it, owned by Al Gore and Lord Blood.
[00:14:38.750 --> 00:15:00.442]  You've got to go to the Chicago Mercantile that's owned by the Clintons and owned by Obama, the carbon section, to actually pay them a percentage on every gallon of gas, on every bit of red meat, on plastic, on fish, thousands and thousands of different things that digitally you will have to pay a tax on that's paid
[00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:03.727]  to private individuals and private banks.
[00:15:04.228 --> 00:15:07.530]  So this is simply the big megabanks finally becoming government.
[00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:22.623]  And they've now got laws being passed around the world where big banks are starting their own mini-cities and mini-towns, and so is big tech, where they are above the law, pay no taxes, but geographically sit inside your country, feeding off of it.
[00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:28.649]  In fact, the globalists have always said that their plan is to have ten regions overall, three mega-regions,
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.690]  You'll have ten governors, and then three mega-councils, and then one super-council.
[00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.351]  And that they will basically have no such thing as nation-states anymore.
[00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:41.011]  Those will just be wild, barren, collapsed areas.
[00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:49.793]  But then you'll have armored, compact super-cities controlled by the globalists, and then small pleasure cities and pleasure towns where they live.
[00:15:50.173 --> 00:15:54.654]  They will then jet-copter in to the main mega-city where their people they control live.
[00:15:55.074 --> 00:15:57.454]  Everyone else will be starving to death outside.
[00:15:58.314 --> 00:16:00.535]  And so they're going to the city-state
[00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:01.455]  Yes.
[00:16:18.593 --> 00:16:20.775]  There is no bad guy left, at least in Massachusetts.
[00:16:48.055 --> 00:16:54.179]  Point the finger at, turn the screws on, and, you know, break their will so they stop emitting.
[00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:54.940]  That's you.
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:55.920]  We have to break your will.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.821]  I can't even say that publicly.
[00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:06.026]  What I'm trying to say is... You're already learning how to have your will broken, to wear a mask, that your small business is not essential, that you're not essential, that you're obsolete.
[00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:11.009]  This is siege, slavery, feudalism, authoritarianism.
[00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:12.030]  Look it all up.
[00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:26.280]  And in almost every case, they're run by very serious military-trained, globalist-trained, foreign trade operatives to absolutely, again, break our will as a foreign enemy and take our nation down because here's the final key on this point.
[00:17:27.423 --> 00:17:37.831]  China, India, Mexico, and 160 plus other countries are all exempt because the globalists are exploiting their third world population, building, doing whatever they want there.
[00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:43.075]  It's only Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the US that are under these controls.
[00:17:43.555 --> 00:17:45.596]  And notice under COVID-19, China's open.
[00:17:45.716 --> 00:17:50.480]  We're not open because we failed and didn't submit to China and the UN's edicts properly.
[00:17:51.024 --> 00:17:51.885]  So it's really up to you.
[00:17:51.925 --> 00:17:54.206]  Are you going to let this guy break your will?
[00:17:54.846 --> 00:17:57.027]  Cut off your energy so he can be fabulously rich?
[00:17:57.488 --> 00:17:59.789]  These people are very wicked parasites.
[00:18:00.349 --> 00:18:06.432]  The most important thing I can relay to conservatives, liberals, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, it doesn't matter is this.
[00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:13.636]  You can play along with the New World Order and play along with your climate crusader and that you're all part of the progressive movement.
[00:18:14.297 --> 00:18:17.659]  It is a vicious, corporate, post-human
[00:18:18.632 --> 00:18:22.033]  Takeover Grid that doesn't believe it's doing this to save the earth.
[00:18:22.613 --> 00:18:34.018]  They're doing this to cull the population so that you can't have access to life extension technologies and so they can move forward in their planned evolution to merge with machines.
[00:18:34.878 --> 00:18:37.479]  It's in ABC News, NBC News, The Wall Street Journal.
[00:18:38.933 --> 00:18:42.454]  They all talk about how wonderful this post-human world is.
[00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:53.998]  So we're under attack by a scientific religion, a scientific dictatorship that is prosecuting a war against us in their own words.
[00:18:54.478 --> 00:18:58.559]  So you can live in denial about this attack all day, or you can admit this is happening.
[00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.840]  It's not just the Massachusetts climate czar, and that's what he is.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.921]  He's your king if you live under him.
[00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:08.662]  It's not just this feudal lord thinking aloud to his minions.
[00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:15.393]  It's also the Democratic Party and the globalists and the Republicans they control through blackmail, they're doing the same thing.
[00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:39.291]  Time Magazine has come out with a huge report that's gone viral bragging how a secret cabal of foreign corporations, domestic corporations, the Pentagon, the Republicans, the Democrats worked together to stop President Trump from being re-elected and then from stopping and blocking Trump from being able to bring out the evidence that it was election fraud.
[00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:41.844]  It's linked on Infowars.com.
[00:19:42.004 --> 00:19:48.288]  MSM admits bipartisan shadow campaign engaged in conspiracy to prevent Trump victory.
[00:19:48.949 --> 00:19:50.730]  I'm about to read from just some of the report.
[00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:59.355]  It's lengthy, but I suggest you read every bit of it because it's vital to hear these monsters brag about what they're doing to all of us and how they're trying to break our will.
[00:19:59.816 --> 00:20:04.058]  The secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election.
[00:20:06.684 --> 00:20:18.770]  Now, a lot of this is true, a lot of this is lies, because they keep implying it was all done fair and square, but that all this corporate money came in and they worked in secret and they got the laws changed at the state level to accept these fraudulent ballots.
[00:20:20.051 --> 00:20:22.072]  But they didn't get the laws changed in those states.
[00:20:22.152 --> 00:20:31.436]  They got consent agreements with governors, with Democrat Party lawyers that were financed with hundreds of millions of dollars from Mark Zuckerberg and others.
[00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:32.477]  So let's get started.
[00:20:33.186 --> 00:20:35.487]  They go on to say, Oh, Trump thought that was a conspiracy.
[00:20:35.767 --> 00:20:37.227]  And in a way he was right.
[00:20:37.747 --> 00:20:39.968]  There was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes.
[00:20:40.408 --> 00:20:45.930]  One that both curtailed the protest and coordinated the resistance from CEOs.
[00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:52.232]  Both surprises were the result of an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans.
[00:20:52.792 --> 00:20:57.534]  The pact was formalized in a terse little notice joint statement from U.S.
[00:20:57.554 --> 00:21:01.635]  Chamber of Commerce AFL-CIO published on election day.
[00:21:02.242 --> 00:21:04.164]  Let's just unpack that little short part.
[00:21:05.164 --> 00:21:12.190]  Big corporations, Nike, Slave Camp running Apple, all of them said riots are good.
[00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.832]  All of them said burning down police stations is wonderful.
[00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:23.219]  They're acting like, oh, because people rioted and were burning the country down seven months before the election, big corporations got scared.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.624]  And Wall Street and others came and said, we're going to give you what you want.
[00:21:29.312 --> 00:21:38.940]  Let's ship your jobs overseas and shut your carbon down and turn your heat off in your house if you just sit back and work with us peacefully to steal this election.
[00:21:39.701 --> 00:21:54.214]  Both sides would come to see it as sort of an implicit bargain inspired by the summer's massive, sometimes destructive, racial justice protest in which the forces of labor came together with the forces of capital to keep the peace and oppose
[00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.992]  Trump's assault on democracy.
[00:21:57.252 --> 00:22:13.024]  The handshake between businesses and labor was just one component of a vast cross-partisan campaign to protect the election, an extraordinary shadow effort directed not to winning the vote, but to ensuring it would be free, fair and credible and uncorrupted.
[00:22:13.204 --> 00:22:14.105]  Oh, yes.
[00:22:15.236 --> 00:22:27.527]  For more than a year, a loosely organized coalition of operatives scrambled to shore up America's institutions as they came under simultaneous attack from the remorseless pandemic and an autocratically inclined president.
[00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:32.351]  But it was the mainstream media that said they wanted a depression to get Trump out of office.
[00:22:32.371 --> 00:22:35.054]  It was the mainstream media that said they were using a lockdown to blame Trump.
[00:22:35.874 --> 00:22:38.597]  Oh, but now the pandemic just magically showed up and helped him.
[00:22:39.824 --> 00:22:41.825]  Their work touched on every aspect of the election.
[00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:47.989]  They got states to change voting systems and laws and help secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding.
[00:22:48.969 --> 00:22:54.272]  After election day, they monitored every pressure point to ensure that Trump could not overturn the results.
[00:22:55.453 --> 00:23:06.039]  They launched the National Voter Protection Program that's now known as HR1 at the federal level to codify law all the fraud they engaged in because they got a problem.
[00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:07.880]  The states are coming back and saying, we didn't pass these laws.
[00:23:09.224 --> 00:23:14.148]  They're like, oh, don't worry, the feds are federalizing it, like everything else, including energy.
[00:23:15.749 --> 00:23:25.216]  This is the inside story of the conspiracy to save the 2020 election, based on access to the group's inner workings, never before seen documents and interviews with dozens of those involved.
[00:23:25.716 --> 00:23:36.224]  So it's also about giving credit to only the substrata, putting out the official story of this racketeering, so that when pieces of it come out, they've already got this disinformation out there.
[00:23:37.349 --> 00:23:40.930]  That's why the participants want the secret history of 2020 election told.
[00:23:42.231 --> 00:23:58.757]  Even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream, a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage, and control the flow of information.
[00:23:59.317 --> 00:24:04.399]  Oh, like all the massive censorship of tens of millions of Americans, including members of the House and the Senate and the President?
[00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.855]  And the lying about us we couldn't defend ourselves?
[00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:09.518]  Oh, how chivalrous!
[00:24:09.678 --> 00:24:11.541]  Oh, you control the flow of information!
[00:24:11.862 --> 00:24:13.945]  Like North Korea, or China, or Cuba!
[00:24:14.687 --> 00:24:16.450]  But so much more high-tech in America!
[00:24:17.073 --> 00:24:32.664]  Then he gets into the architects of it, the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest federation, working with its former archenemies of Wall Street and others, and now they're just all friends, and now you did a great job, coalition!
[00:24:32.865 --> 00:24:35.066]  So your jobs that Trump was bringing back are gone.
[00:24:35.466 --> 00:24:36.527]  Good job, unions.
[00:24:36.908 --> 00:24:38.028]  Your leaders are so good.
[00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:44.013]  When he coached his now-defunct Little Leagues team in D.C.
[00:24:44.053 --> 00:24:45.674]  suburbs, this is the head of the AFL-CIO,
[00:24:46.158 --> 00:24:47.499]  He trained boys basically how to cheat.
[00:24:48.599 --> 00:24:51.440]  But it's okay because it was for a greater good for the children.
[00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:57.563]  But they won the team championship and it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:24:57.903 --> 00:25:01.265]  COVID-19 erupted at the height of the primary election season.
[00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:08.628]  Normal methods of voting were no longer safe for voters or the mostly elderly volunteers who normally staff the polling places.
[00:25:10.009 --> 00:25:12.010]  So Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:25:13.459 --> 00:25:20.181]  Gave them hundreds of millions of dollars and so did Bloomberg when he supposedly ran, that was a money laundering operation, to pump a half billion dollars into all this.
[00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:34.146]  They then went out and set up the infrastructure, paid for everything, hired the volunteers, trained them how to handle the ballots, the 80 million they printed up, gave the 80 million ballots to the volunteers, and they gave them to the local activist groups and told them how to fill them out.
[00:25:34.526 --> 00:25:38.268]  And they tell you how it's the new right of voting, like illegal aliens voting.
[00:25:39.668 --> 00:25:41.089]  Remember, oh, we don't want illegal aliens to vote.
[00:25:41.109 --> 00:25:42.249]  Oh yeah, they have a right to vote now.
[00:25:43.148 --> 00:25:46.291]  There's no law, but it's the right thing to do.
[00:25:47.452 --> 00:25:51.556]  The meetings became the galactic center for the constellation of operatives.
[00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:57.142]  These Zoom meetings across the left who shared overlapping goals, but didn't usually work in concert.
[00:25:57.622 --> 00:26:00.265]  The group had no name, no leaders, and no hierarchy.
[00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:00.685]  Wow.
[00:26:01.085 --> 00:26:04.389]  But it kept a desperate group in sync.
[00:26:05.089 --> 00:26:06.451]  It's just so beautiful how they did it.
[00:26:06.891 --> 00:26:07.832]  Securing the vote.
[00:26:08.487 --> 00:26:12.809]  Into the future, HR1, and how they're going to make sure this doesn't happen again.
[00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.071]  We can't have populists win again.
[00:26:15.131 --> 00:26:16.952]  We're getting it all set up.
[00:26:17.952 --> 00:26:25.677]  We've got all these former CIA and Navy SEALs people that work for the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Bill Gates, and they're all going to make sure that your will's broken.
[00:26:26.097 --> 00:26:26.497]  Okay?
[00:26:26.777 --> 00:26:27.158]  All right.
[00:26:28.518 --> 00:26:35.923]  The Institute's work helped 37 states and DC bolster mail voting, but it wouldn't be worth much if people didn't take advantage.
[00:26:36.443 --> 00:26:36.723]  And again,
[00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:43.838]  When there's one of their people's challenge though, like a union's challenging Jeff Bezos, it's not allowed.
[00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:49.321]  Then you don't allow the mail-in voting with no ID or no proper signature verification.
[00:26:49.881 --> 00:26:50.861]  So they also admit that.
[00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:53.223]  They say, now if it's one of our areas, you can't have it.
[00:26:54.903 --> 00:26:58.125]  The effort had to overcome the heightened skepticism in some communities.
[00:26:58.405 --> 00:27:00.026]  Oh yes, it just goes on from there.
[00:27:03.447 --> 00:27:06.709]  Here's Mark Zuckerberg helped out with hundreds of millions of dollars and
[00:27:07.245 --> 00:27:10.888]  He agreed to help censor anybody challenging anything with lies.
[00:27:10.928 --> 00:27:12.429]  And of course, they all know it's lies.
[00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:14.491]  They're the shadowy secret cabal.
[00:27:14.891 --> 00:27:18.694]  And then they're going to decide what you can say and what you can do and break your will.
[00:27:19.055 --> 00:27:20.316]  Oh, but don't say that.
[00:27:21.577 --> 00:27:23.838]  Don't say break your will or break your back out in public.
[00:27:24.139 --> 00:27:26.621]  And you can watch the people in the Zoom meetings giggling.
[00:27:27.822 --> 00:27:28.842]  We're so powerful.
[00:27:28.862 --> 00:27:29.583]  It's like a video game.
[00:27:29.863 --> 00:27:33.646]  We just break all farmers' wills and factories' wills and mines.
[00:27:36.308 --> 00:27:39.009]  People who work in forestry just whack, whack, whack, whack, whack.
[00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:45.310]  And while you whack down all the Americans, all the investments in the Chinese slave camps for the globalists go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[00:27:45.771 --> 00:27:48.551]  So whack the Americans, whack, whack, whack, whack, whack, break their will.
[00:27:48.791 --> 00:27:51.572]  Oh, but here's the best part, the people power.
[00:27:52.432 --> 00:28:05.476]  It talks about what happened and how they used the George Floyd death in the media to galvanize and raise $10.6 billion for the Democratic Party through the name Black Lives Matter.
[00:28:06.596 --> 00:28:12.561]  So they harnessed the momentum for the election without allowing it to be co-opted by the politicians.
[00:28:13.042 --> 00:28:14.883]  They just got that $10.6 billion.
[00:28:15.363 --> 00:28:16.765]  And the strange bedfellows.
[00:28:17.285 --> 00:28:19.747]  We have the head of the AFL-CIO working with the U.S.
[00:28:19.787 --> 00:28:22.510]  Chamber of Commerce to offshore jobs.
[00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:23.751]  They're such heroes.
[00:28:25.212 --> 00:28:27.794]  And then they talk about what happened once the election came.
[00:28:28.194 --> 00:28:34.680]  They weren't ready quite yet to activate their millions of people to burn down cities because they thought it might backfire.
[00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:46.437]  And so they would just say that he was really the legitimate president, call him president-elect, and then they had their reserves to burn down the cities if they needed to, but they didn't need to.
[00:28:47.978 --> 00:28:48.879]  And this final piece.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:56.224]  January 6th, they ordered all leftist activists to not be on the streets in D.C.
[00:28:57.265 --> 00:29:05.631]  and to dress up as Trump supporters and go to the front of the line before Trump even got to the Capitol and say, Alex Jones says attack!
[00:29:07.182 --> 00:29:11.705]  Get in there, get them, and a few hundred out of a million people did break in.
[00:29:11.745 --> 00:29:14.566]  The police were ordered to stand down, and you know the rest is history.
[00:29:14.606 --> 00:29:16.107]  They call it the greatest terror attack in U.S.
[00:29:16.127 --> 00:29:16.468]  history.
[00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:17.888]  Four citizens killed.
[00:29:17.968 --> 00:29:19.449]  One cop had a heart attack two days later.
[00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:22.431]  The coroner now admits was not killed by the capital assault.
[00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:33.658]  But you can read it right here how they ordered him to stand down and just knew that Trump's people were going to tear up the town, even though we had all those other rallies that never happened to cause any damage in D.C.
[00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.912]  They wanted to be mindful of when it was the right time, and it just wasn't the right time.
[00:29:41.752 --> 00:29:45.013]  And then there was the last milestone of incredible victory.
[00:29:45.994 --> 00:29:46.954]  January 6th.
[00:29:48.274 --> 00:29:53.256]  The thousands who answered the call of President Trump were met by virtually no counter-demonstrators.
[00:29:54.136 --> 00:30:04.180]  To preserve safety and ensure that they couldn't be blamed for any mayhem, the activist left was strenuously discouraged from counteractivity, the AFL-CIO leader said.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:15.122]  Then they crossed their fingers and sent out an emoji of crossed fingers, ordering all their groups, who they'd already ordered out to burn down cities previously, to stand down, showing they're in command and control of these groups.
[00:30:17.143 --> 00:30:22.084]  Vice President Pence could reject state's electoral votes, Trump told them to go to the Capitol.
[00:30:22.784 --> 00:30:29.766]  Then he returned to the White House as they sacked the building, as lawmakers fled for their lives, and his own supporters were shot and trampled.
[00:30:30.086 --> 00:30:32.607]  Trump praised the rioters as very special.
[00:30:34.394 --> 00:30:38.775]  They're going to say they've done an incredible job in order to stand down and their forces were not there.
[00:30:39.075 --> 00:30:39.935]  But they were there.
[00:30:40.195 --> 00:30:44.977]  We saw the left, wooled the bullhorns en masse, trying to trick folks to attack the building.
[00:30:45.937 --> 00:30:47.557]  And less than 1% actually did.
[00:30:47.617 --> 00:30:52.758]  But this is how the left manipulates people, like a matador with a red cape manipulating the bull.
[00:30:53.539 --> 00:31:03.361]  Now enter the picture of Ruben Verastegui, 27, arrested yesterday for reportedly trying to plan meetings with other men
[00:31:03.919 --> 00:31:07.301]  To gang rape babies so he could hear them scream.
[00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:16.706]  Now, I'm not going to read to you the things he said, the things he was advertising, but when you're in D.C., it's crawling with these slimebacks.
[00:31:17.907 --> 00:31:26.131]  They even advertise on Twitter, senior lawyers, that they represent pedophiles and help get them security clearances.
[00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:28.082]  This is the power cult.
[00:31:28.522 --> 00:31:29.643]  This is the main group.
[00:31:30.143 --> 00:31:38.229]  And of course he was part of the Republican leadership move that went after Marjorie Greene.
[00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.111]  And that's why this is so important.
[00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:46.504]  is these individuals have penetrated the highest levels of our government.
[00:31:47.404 --> 00:31:49.005]  Oh, and guess what else Rubin does?
[00:31:49.726 --> 00:31:55.490]  He works at one of these international companies that's setting up the carbon taxes and again helping break our will.
[00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.871]  It's just one big happy club.
[00:31:57.891 --> 00:32:03.935]  And that's exactly what I was covering on Thursday and people couldn't believe it.
[00:32:04.696 --> 00:32:07.698]  You can go back to the Washington Post five years ago
[00:32:08.817 --> 00:32:09.477]  Here's another one.
[00:32:09.537 --> 00:32:12.198]  Now let's tie that into what's happening in Germany.
[00:32:36.687 --> 00:32:55.619]  They have discovered, state-run, by Child Protective Services and by the left, in almost every major German city and in every German state, industrial-level pedophile rings with thousands of children per city going back decades, as young as two, three, four years old.
[00:32:56.923 --> 00:33:01.404]  Placed with convicted child rapist pedophiles.
[00:33:02.024 --> 00:33:06.085]  And in the documents, the psychiatrists say this is true love.
[00:33:06.565 --> 00:33:07.665]  It's between a man and a boy.
[00:33:08.165 --> 00:33:16.326]  And that we want to end the family unit and build a new family with heterosexual children that are taken away and placed in pedophile rings.
[00:33:16.986 --> 00:33:20.307]  So it's not just that they're placing them with them because they get money from the pedophiles.
[00:33:20.767 --> 00:33:26.188]  They're doing this as a giant evil ritual to break our will and totally screw these children up.
[00:33:27.426 --> 00:33:32.670]  So they will grow up being pedophiles as well and continue the recruitment and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:50.865]  First it was one psychiatrist in Berlin, then it was another in Cologne, then it was another in and then it was just every city where you would have the CPS psychiatrist grabbing children and handing them over to convicted pedophiles and now to Islamic families.
[00:33:51.385 --> 00:33:57.010]  Little girls are being handed over who are from Christian families to Islamic families and they're being put into sex trade
[00:33:57.543 --> 00:34:00.750]  Not just in Germany, but in Australia and in the UK.
[00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:01.512]  It's huge.
[00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:03.556]  And these giant grooming gangs.
[00:34:04.097 --> 00:34:05.580]  And then, as the little girls complain...
[00:34:06.513 --> 00:34:11.294]  They chopped them up and they put them into kebab cookers and feed them to people on the street.
[00:34:11.654 --> 00:34:12.515]  That's an extra joke.
[00:34:12.715 --> 00:34:13.275]  I'm not kidding.
[00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:14.315]  Mainstream news.
[00:34:14.655 --> 00:34:20.697]  And the gypsies now are allowed to steal your RVs because you're bad, because you're white.
[00:34:21.217 --> 00:34:23.538]  They're allowed to steal your RVs because it's their culture.
[00:34:23.898 --> 00:34:24.458]  I'm not kidding.
[00:34:24.478 --> 00:34:25.978]  This is the total breakdown of society.
[00:34:26.478 --> 00:34:29.479]  I could go on for hours with just the stuff that broke this week.
[00:34:29.499 --> 00:34:32.860]  But understand, this is from dw.eu.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.661]  This is from the biggest German TV station.
[00:34:37.156 --> 00:34:44.378]  In Germany, laying this out, German nuns sold orphaned children to sex predators for giant gang rapes.
[00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:50.100]  Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile probe.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.561]  Child sex abuse trial, the horrors of Germany.
[00:34:55.481 --> 00:35:03.984]  German nuns rented orphaned boys to businessmen for gang bang orgies, suppressed report seen by the media.
[00:35:05.953 --> 00:35:08.715]  And now they've killed all the busts that Trump was involved in.
[00:35:08.815 --> 00:35:09.855]  Tenfold increase.
[00:35:11.336 --> 00:35:13.838]  And now you hear them saying that Trump put children in cages.
[00:35:13.898 --> 00:35:15.839]  Trump got the children out of cages.
[00:35:15.899 --> 00:35:20.242]  So remember that left who all got together to steal the election?
[00:35:20.742 --> 00:35:23.024]  You now help Apple run death camps in China.
[00:35:23.684 --> 00:35:26.646]  You now help end the raids on the pedophiles.
[00:35:27.687 --> 00:35:33.851]  And now the very same people that helped do this are on Twitter behaving like and acting like they want the CIA
[00:35:34.844 --> 00:35:36.905]  To start killing American citizens.
[00:35:37.286 --> 00:35:44.891]  And on CNN and on MSNBC, they have hosts saying it's time to kill people that don't wear masks and don't stay in their homes.
[00:35:45.911 --> 00:35:48.653]  And it's time to kill Trump supporters and use the CIA on them.
[00:35:49.173 --> 00:35:51.215]  This is an authoritarian takeover.
[00:35:51.895 --> 00:35:58.480]  This is an attempt to break our backs, to cut off our energy, to tell us we're not essential, to take our guns, to take our children.
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.842]  It's an attack on the Western world, reverse colonization,
[00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:10.297]  With megabanks transferring all of our wealth to themselves by declaring us non-essential.
[00:36:11.338 --> 00:36:12.799]  All of this ties together.
[00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:14.940]  These individuals are predators.
[00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:18.884]  They are censoring the entire web to keep this information from getting out.
[00:36:19.164 --> 00:36:28.031]  But you can take this critical emergency report and share it by email and by text message or by word of mouth or reposting on your site today.
[00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:33.783]  They can censor some of us, but they can't censor all of us, and get it out on Twitter, and get it out on Facebook.
[00:36:34.283 --> 00:36:45.252]  And you watch Mark Zuckerberg, and you watch the head of Twitter, and the heads of Google, Sundar Pichai, you watch them block and censor this.
[00:36:46.172 --> 00:36:48.554]  It's not your job to make sure it even gets out there.
[00:36:48.574 --> 00:36:55.760]  It's your job to post it, and then watch as Big Tech signs on to suppressing the truth about this.
[00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:58.002]  And then they've got God to deal with.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.841]  These people think they're God.
[00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:00.562]  They're not God.
[00:37:01.242 --> 00:37:03.024]  And they are going to summon the whirlwind.
[00:37:03.084 --> 00:37:04.785]  They have got a tiger by the tail.
[00:37:04.885 --> 00:37:07.287]  But we have to get focused.
[00:37:07.407 --> 00:37:08.688]  We have to stay focused.
[00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:19.798]  We have to reach out to others and let them realize the Great Reset and Agenda 21, Agenda 2030 is a globalist takeover and is meant to bankrupt us and break our will and break our backs.
[00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:21.499]  And we can't let them do that.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.964]  We can't submit to them because where they're taking us only gets worse.
[00:37:28.433 --> 00:37:31.614]  If you submit to a heavy weight on your chest, it'll suffocate you.
[00:37:32.274 --> 00:37:34.574]  If you push it off of your chest, you're going to get stronger.
[00:37:35.574 --> 00:37:43.456]  And so we have to resist this and become stronger, not submit to it and become slaves and totally obsolete.
[00:37:44.096 --> 00:37:45.676]  These people have signed on to evil.
[00:37:45.716 --> 00:37:49.697]  They have sold their souls and they are moving against humanity right now.
[00:37:50.037 --> 00:37:52.037]  But the children are worth it and deserve it.
[00:37:52.657 --> 00:37:54.218]  And the innocents are worth it and deserve it.
[00:37:54.298 --> 00:37:55.518]  And you're worth it and deserve it.
[00:37:56.015 --> 00:37:58.637]  But freedom and free, you're going to have to stand up and demand it now.
[00:37:59.358 --> 00:38:00.479]  The enemy knows they're in trouble.
[00:38:00.499 --> 00:38:11.067]  They're accelerating a decades-long plan that was really developed more than a hundred years ago by British royalty to control the population, back to Cecil Rhodes and his system that trained David Ismay.
[00:38:12.188 --> 00:38:15.631]  But if we know the enemy plan, we can beat it together.
[00:38:16.631 --> 00:38:17.832]  These people are monsters.
[00:38:19.113 --> 00:38:21.655]  You've got to admit they're monsters, and you've got to face these monsters.
[00:38:22.176 --> 00:38:24.718]  But remember, the David Ismays are just the Frankenstein.
[00:38:25.848 --> 00:38:31.090]  The real enemy is Dr. Frankenstein and the globalists that have actually set up this system and set it in motion.
[00:38:32.511 --> 00:38:44.655]  The only hope we have is for you to check this out for yourself, find out it's true, share it with others, and then begin to take constructive, focused action legally, lawfully, and culturally against these people.
[00:38:45.636 --> 00:38:46.716]  No offensive violence.
[00:38:47.937 --> 00:38:53.659]  But when they come with their forced inoculations, when they come to take your children, as they're announcing they're going to do with the contact tracers,
[00:38:54.235 --> 00:39:02.660]  When they make their move to abuse you and your family physically and launch physical war on you, you will have to defensively decide what you're going to do at that time.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:12.985]  Tomorrow night on the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., I'm going to talk about the fact that we have to work towards taking our governments back and work towards fixing society.
[00:39:13.705 --> 00:39:15.767]  But for those that wait too long, there'll be no hope.
[00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:21.990]  We have to also start realizing that it's time for many of you to begin your evacuation out of the cities.
[00:39:22.472 --> 00:39:22.672]  I think?
[00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:47.983]  They're not going to leave these type of political activists and operatives around that have a taste for blood.
[00:39:48.203 --> 00:39:52.364]  They're going to get rid of them in a night of the long knives very, very soon.
[00:39:52.484 --> 00:40:02.086]  So that's again, as I started, I will end this message that all of you pretending you're part of the power structure and going along with this are in grave, grave danger.
[00:40:02.987 --> 00:40:08.688]  This, this is literally signing on to a deal with the devil and you need to repent of what you've been involved in.
[00:40:09.457 --> 00:40:12.700]  Or whatever moral compass you may have left and just feel the danger of this.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:22.288]  I know it's thrilling to those of you who've been going along with this and you feel like you're part of something big and you get a sick thrill about being involved in something this dark.
[00:40:23.068 --> 00:40:26.891]  But this is a black hole that will suck you in and destroy you in the end.
[00:40:27.652 --> 00:40:37.380]  And there's still time if you have any inkling of a spirit, any inkling of a soul, if the hair on the back of your neck standing up, that's God trying to touch you on the shoulder and tell you, turn back.
[00:40:37.878 --> 00:40:38.618]  While there's still time.
[00:40:39.299 --> 00:40:41.300]  All right, please share this report with everybody you know.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.481]  God bless and good luck and don't let them break your will.
[00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:04.392]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:41:10.805 --> 00:41:24.407]  At the age of 33, Klaus Schwab, a business professor at the University of Geneva, founded the World Economic Forum in 1971, originally known as the European Management Forum.
[00:41:26.092 --> 00:41:42.963]  Nicknamed Davos after its annual meeting place, the World Economic Forum meets every January with hundreds of members of business, politics, banking, education and industry to quote, improve the state of the world.
[00:41:44.164 --> 00:41:48.187]  Their globalist agenda is openly admitted and well documented.
[00:41:49.375 --> 00:42:01.818]  United Nations Agenda 2030, The Great Reset, Build Back Better, are all the same globalist agenda, and all stem from the Club of Rome and the eugenics movement.
[00:42:03.078 --> 00:42:13.141]  Davos claims to be looking to save the planet, and the UN claim that in 10 years they will end all hunger and poverty on Earth.
[00:42:14.346 --> 00:42:19.269]  They admit that the technologies required to achieve these goals do not exist.
[00:42:20.049 --> 00:42:25.332]  And yet, their solution is to bring the world to zero emissions in only 10 years.
[00:42:26.313 --> 00:42:31.356]  They want to end the automobile and aviation industries in only 10 years.
[00:42:32.277 --> 00:42:37.900]  This is why the Keystone Pipeline was halted on day one by globalist puppet Joe Biden.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:46.082]  Klaus Schwab says that industries which involve human interaction will not survive.
[00:42:46.442 --> 00:42:54.924]  But we know that many industries which rely particularly on physical interaction will have difficulties to survive.
[00:42:55.384 --> 00:43:09.889]  As if the destruction of an entire functioning society will inspire solutions to all of our problems, thereby bringing about an environmental utopia where there is no hunger and all the world is at peace.
[00:43:11.198 --> 00:43:15.640]  As absurd as this all sounds, we know the sheep will accept it as gospel.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.441]  They already have.
[00:43:18.641 --> 00:43:25.525]  When the WHO was caught faking a hoax 10 years ago, the media reported it, but nobody cared.
[00:43:26.405 --> 00:43:27.465]  It was a beta test.
[00:43:28.286 --> 00:43:31.987]  Now, the media ignores overwhelming evidence that COVID-19 is a hoax.
[00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:40.955]  They go along with every contradiction and lie, and their audience obediently accepts it all as truth.
[00:43:42.016 --> 00:43:48.641]  The COVID crisis will be used to imprison the population, whether it be in camps or their own home.
[00:43:49.462 --> 00:43:50.643]  It is already happening.
[00:43:51.223 --> 00:43:56.648]  Humanity is being imprisoned by psychopaths who see themselves as our saviors.
[00:43:58.337 --> 00:43:59.718]  Order out of chaos.
[00:44:00.378 --> 00:44:06.842]  The New World Order is nothing other than the decrepit Old World Order desperately clinging to power.
[00:44:07.502 --> 00:44:15.127]  And their solution is to destroy the free market, to destroy the concept of freedom, privacy, and private property.
[00:44:16.127 --> 00:44:28.417]  And to foment enough chaos and destruction to depopulate the earth into a manageable level of serfs and slaves, so they can continue on with the same old scams they've been running for millennia.
[00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:37.484]  This is why Joe Biden signed a dozen executive orders, paving the way to opening the borders and shutting down the economy.
[00:44:38.578 --> 00:44:42.520]  The New World Order cannot coexist with American civil liberties.
[00:44:43.301 --> 00:44:49.424]  And now that the populist movement has been discarded, the destruction of America from within can commence again.
[00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:57.809]  If the people of the world continue to comply to these unelected sycophants, then the people will get what they deserve.
[00:44:58.790 --> 00:45:01.051]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:45:18.784 --> 00:45:19.765]  This is Gold Leader.
[00:45:19.785 --> 00:45:21.225]  We're starting our attack run.
[00:45:21.245 --> 00:45:25.788]  Exhaust port is marked and locked in.
[00:45:26.508 --> 00:45:28.009]  I'm not giving out financial advice.
[00:45:28.669 --> 00:45:34.272]  I'm not in the stock market because it is a casino and it's got so many corrupt aspects to it and ends up cheating people and ripping people off.
[00:45:34.573 --> 00:45:35.833]  That's why I've never gotten into Bitcoin.
[00:45:36.093 --> 00:45:37.154]  I'm all for cryptocurrencies.
[00:45:37.214 --> 00:45:39.075]  It's a real technology, a real science, but...
[00:45:40.035 --> 00:45:46.898]  There's a wild, wild West aspect to all of this, and so it's just not something that I would tell the general audience to get involved in, but that's up to you.
[00:45:47.258 --> 00:45:47.938]  We're too close!
[00:45:48.058 --> 00:45:49.099]  Stay on target.
[00:45:51.379 --> 00:45:58.702]  This is a real rebellion against the jackals, the hyenas of the big mega banks that are at the top of the food chain.
[00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:02.944]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the Communist Chinese Bank.
[00:46:03.864 --> 00:46:07.826]  They use these jackals to go in and target hundreds of Western
[00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:26.008]  Companies, brick-and-mortar companies, every single year, they short them, they make billions ripping off small investors that had been buying stock for decades in it, and then they consolidate control, and then once the company is going bankrupt, they buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:46:26.368 --> 00:46:30.330]  That is the specialty of Bain Capital, the specialty of these other groups.
[00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:36.653]  And right now, the most predatory, out-of-control groups that are designed to vertically integrate society, consolidate control,
[00:46:37.558 --> 00:46:47.066]  Are at the heart of the Great Reset and at the heart of the big six tech companies, all roughly doubling their profits in the last year of the lockdown.
[00:46:47.106 --> 00:46:48.487]  And that's why they want to keep it permanent.
[00:46:48.547 --> 00:46:51.850]  So, we are striking a blow at the Great Reset.
[00:46:53.091 --> 00:47:00.357]  When they talk about Build Back Better, they mean after they've bankrupted us, then they can come dictate a universal income to us, force inoculations.
[00:47:00.377 --> 00:47:02.458]  They now admit it'll be tied to universal income.
[00:47:03.099 --> 00:47:06.862]  Now, the Associated Press and others are reporting 80 plus billion dollars
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.661]  Has been lost by the most predatory hedge funds.
[00:47:09.681 --> 00:47:10.602]  You look at these dirtbags.
[00:47:10.642 --> 00:47:20.006]  These are the scum of the earth that destroy small companies, that destroy good businesses, that destroy every gun manufacturers.
[00:47:21.307 --> 00:47:21.807]  You name it.
[00:47:21.887 --> 00:47:25.109]  These people have made it impossible to do business in Europe and the United States.
[00:47:25.789 --> 00:47:26.689]  That was their job.
[00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.911]  So everybody had to move to China where there's no regulations or no controls.
[00:47:30.791 --> 00:47:32.092]  The ultimate Achilles heel.
[00:47:32.672 --> 00:47:33.693]  Just simply type in
[00:47:34.597 --> 00:47:37.659]  GameStop, and then type in silver trading.
[00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:40.981]  And for those that don't know, Max Keiser is a very smart person.
[00:47:41.501 --> 00:47:57.670]  Max Keiser, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago, a year ago, said, Alex, if you could ever get your audience to get into the silver market, into digital silver market, even if they only bought $100, you know, of it, and then demand payment after the options are over,
[00:47:58.203 --> 00:48:04.366]  You know, there's a global insurrection against the banker occupation going on around the world.
[00:48:05.107 --> 00:48:05.527]  Why?
[00:48:06.227 --> 00:48:12.911]  Because it has been discovered that the global banking cartel has a soft underbelly at J.P.
[00:48:12.951 --> 00:48:13.331]  Morgan.
[00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:14.171]  J.P.
[00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:20.415]  Morgan has 1.5 trillion exposure in derivatives to a rising silver price.
[00:48:21.195 --> 00:48:24.397]  As silver prices rise, J.P.
[00:48:24.497 --> 00:48:26.459]  Morgan's life is on the line.
[00:48:26.519 --> 00:48:29.521]  We have the ability to take down a giant.
[00:48:29.861 --> 00:48:31.302]  This is fantastic.
[00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:34.344]  Before we go to your viral campaign of crass J.P.
[00:48:34.364 --> 00:48:37.606]  Morgan buy silver, I want to set the stage for revolution.
[00:48:37.767 --> 00:48:39.808]  I have King Eric in the headlines.
[00:48:40.188 --> 00:48:42.510]  Cantona, collapse the banks.
[00:48:45.512 --> 00:48:49.374]  He says, we don't pick up weapons to kill people to start the revolution.
[00:48:49.915 --> 00:48:52.636]  The revolution is really easy to do nowadays.
[00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:55.498]  What is the system?
[00:48:55.818 --> 00:48:57.940]  The system turns around the banks.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:01.842]  It's based on the power of the banks.
[00:49:03.925 --> 00:49:07.049]  So it must be destroyed starting from the banks.
[00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:16.121]  This means that the three million people with the placards on the street, they go to the bank, withdraw their money from banks, and these ones collapse.
[00:49:16.502 --> 00:49:18.665]  Well, yes, he makes a good point.
[00:49:19.065 --> 00:49:21.266]  It's a step in the right direction, isn't it?
[00:49:21.526 --> 00:49:25.908]  Taking your money out of the bank, similar to the campaign in the United States, move your money.
[00:49:26.328 --> 00:49:30.750]  But unless you do something with that money, it's really going to fail.
[00:49:31.771 --> 00:49:37.673]  Unless you take the money you take out of the banks, the paper money, the fiat money, and buy silver bullion with it.
[00:49:38.054 --> 00:49:39.454]  Then you've got the full 360 degree
[00:49:41.331 --> 00:49:48.076]  A weapon of disenfranchisement pointed at the banking system's heart with a silver spike.
[00:49:48.196 --> 00:49:54.701]  Through that, as Matt Taibbi calls them, the vampire squids that are strangling the global economy.
[00:49:54.841 --> 00:50:03.987]  If you do a search and now, uh, crash JP Morgan buy silver, you'll see that the Google is replete and YouTube is replete with videos and articles written on this.
[00:50:04.007 --> 00:50:07.690]  So this Google bomb technology within the last 72 hours has been
[00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.290]  Incredibly effective.
[00:50:09.631 --> 00:50:12.811]  Since you're kind of the granddaddy of this, what do we do next?
[00:50:12.871 --> 00:50:13.692]  What's the next level?
[00:50:13.732 --> 00:50:14.552]  Where do we go from here?
[00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:19.053]  I know Google is trying to block some of the things that we're doing.
[00:50:19.353 --> 00:50:26.195]  Sometimes we put the term out and they will block InfoWars and Prison Planet where they're non-searchable with those particular articles.
[00:50:26.235 --> 00:50:35.138]  But it doesn't matter because thousands of other sites then copy our stories over and so those pop up and then that leads people to us to get the information.
[00:50:35.618 --> 00:50:36.360]  This is dangerous.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:36.981]  This is war.
[00:50:37.182 --> 00:50:38.424]  This is not about making money.
[00:50:38.965 --> 00:50:46.681]  It's about standing up to these scumbags that have been screwing us over and rigging the whole damn game and finally we wake up and realize we can fight back too.
[00:51:19.987 --> 00:51:20.687]  It's back in stock.
[00:51:20.727 --> 00:51:22.168]  It's been sold out for over eight months.
[00:51:22.188 --> 00:51:25.271]  We couldn't get it because the lockdown pollen block is back in stock.
[00:51:25.291 --> 00:51:26.231]  Let me tell you real quick about it.
[00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:30.615]  With the power of quail egg concentrate, pollen block acts differently than traditional antihistamines.
[00:51:30.635 --> 00:51:36.660]  It was clinically studied to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms by helping to clear sinus passages and aiding respiratory function.
[00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:37.460]  It's amazing.
[00:51:37.841 --> 00:51:39.062]  Folks absolutely love it.
[00:51:39.322 --> 00:51:41.724]  And again, France has been shut down so we couldn't get it.
[00:51:42.264 --> 00:51:44.045]  Now a limited supply is back in stock.
[00:51:45.126 --> 00:51:46.808]  25% off at infowarrestore.com.
[00:51:47.088 --> 00:51:47.968]  Pollen block again.
[00:51:48.769 --> 00:51:50.790]  It's available in this one-minute ad.
[00:51:50.810 --> 00:52:01.815]  I don't have time to tell you all about it, but believe me, I have really wanted it back in because it works naturally, unlike some of the stuff that's over-the-counter that makes you all be speedy and irritable and gives you a headache.
[00:52:01.875 --> 00:52:03.196]  This is naturally occurring.
[00:52:03.496 --> 00:52:09.759]  It's the secret of how the quail don't have the seasonal distress, and it's passed on somehow through their eggs to us.
[00:52:10.239 --> 00:52:11.220]  You chew up the pills.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.040]  They taste great.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.861]  It's available again.
[00:52:13.201 --> 00:52:14.181]  M4WarStore.com.
[00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:15.242]  Call and block.
[00:52:15.482 --> 00:52:16.422]  M4WarStore.com.
[00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:22.315]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:52:32.364 --> 00:52:34.385]  Infowars has been banned.
[00:52:36.547 --> 00:52:37.268]  Arrested.
[00:52:40.651 --> 00:52:42.172]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:52:43.393 --> 00:52:44.995]  Because we are effective.
[00:52:46.547 --> 00:52:48.129]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:52:48.529 --> 00:52:50.212]  Go to band.video.
