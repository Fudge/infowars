[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.951]  COVID is Theranos scam and Elizabeth Holmes 2.0.
[00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:06.833]  And she came right out of the same group of people.
[00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:23.262]  Major scientific reports on top of major scientific reports from major scientific institutions, confirming what was even in the New York Times last year, of all places, that only 6% of people that died, supposedly of COVID-19, died from COVID-19.
[00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:26.944]  Remember they told you a 2, 3, 4% death rate?
[00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:27.745]  It isn't even 1 tenth of 1%.
[00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:32.682]  Remember they told you all those lies?
[00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:35.425]  Well now it's all coming out.
[00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:39.869]  CDC busted inflating COVID numbers accused of violating federal law.
[00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.673]  I've got all the data, all the CDC's own numbers, right here for you.
[00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:50.077]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.594]  People should not be afraid of their governments.
[00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.756]  Governments should be afraid of their people.
[00:01:32.617 --> 00:01:36.120]  Several party members have been murdered.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.063]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:50.605]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:52.687]  It just pancaked.
[00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:56.910]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.912]  New York, very much a city still in chaos.
[00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:04.256]  The phones are not working properly, the subway lines are not working properly.
[00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:09.099]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us, just across the Tigris River here.
[00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.563]  This is a sharp end or top for the population of Baghdad.
[00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:16.324]  Shock and awe, indeed.
[00:02:16.785 --> 00:02:22.288]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:25.810]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.730]  Come on!
[00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:30.352]  It is a big idea.
[00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:31.973]  A new world order.
[00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:32.954]  I love my dad.
[00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.367]  I'd kill for him.
[00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.388]  I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:38.388]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:41.009]  What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:42.590]  My sister-in-law.
[00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.531]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:49.952]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:51.633]  I think he's a traitor.
[00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:55.354]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them.
[00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:57.415]  Obama is the one that put them in harm's way.
[00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:59.816]  Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:04.238]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[00:03:04.318 --> 00:03:05.319]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.619]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:07.780]  This isn't a game!
[00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:13.707]  Welcome to America, ISIS!
[00:03:13.747 --> 00:03:14.848]  This is what we do!
[00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:15.488]  Woo!
[00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.451]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:21.272]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:22.913]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:32.079]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote, the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.500]  In 2012, the U.S.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.742]  was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups.
[00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:37.763]  Why did you not stop that?
[00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:39.044]  Why didn't you come forward before?
[00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:40.405]  What were you waiting for?
[00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:42.026]  Oh, for you, Inspector.
[00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:43.766]  I needed you.
[00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:53.669]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected.
[00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.471]  We're all part of it.
[00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:01.271]  Are we ready for it?
[00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:08.473]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:14.735]  I've got the goods on the enemy and I am ready to go, loaded for bear.
[00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:19.458]  Like a champion racehorse with the gates about to open.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.241]  We got a lot of big guests and key intel today.
[00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:24.522]  Laura Loomer joins us.
[00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:26.523]  She's been put on a red flag list with no criminal record.
[00:04:26.844 --> 00:04:29.386]  Democrats announced basically all Trump supporters will have their guns taken.
[00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:35.770]  Anthony Comey is going to be joining us and a lot of other expert guests here on the broadcast.
[00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.334]  Gregory Manorino, John Rappaport, and so much more.
[00:04:41.374 --> 00:04:50.480]  But when we return, I'm going to lay out the most critical evidence yet of COVID-19 being a globalist, fraud-based takeover plan and how we can stop it.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.681]  That and so much more straight ahead.
[00:04:54.642 --> 00:04:56.704]  Start your engines, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:04.569]  It is February 3rd, 2021 on this Wednesday live broadcast going out worldwide.
[00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:19.165]  We're seeing the rise of the globalist AI takeover system designed to replace humanity because we are obsolescent, obsolete, non-essential.
[00:05:19.926 --> 00:05:21.107]  What a time to be alive.
[00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:21.788]  All right.
[00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:24.587]  We have four guests joining us today.
[00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:25.707]  I'll be getting to that in a moment.
[00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:28.828]  But let me just dig right into the news headline stacks.
[00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:45.514]  Major scientific reports on top of major scientific reports from major scientific institutions, confirming what was even in the New York Times last year, of all places, that only 6% of people that died, supposedly of COVID-19, died from COVID-19.
[00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:49.195]  Remember they told you a 2, 3, 4% death rate?
[00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:49.995]  It isn't even 1 10th of 1%.
[00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:54.932]  Remember they told you all those lies?
[00:05:56.173 --> 00:05:57.695]  Well now it's all coming out.
[00:05:57.775 --> 00:06:02.118]  CDC busted inflating COVID numbers, accused of violating federal law.
[00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:06.922]  I've got all the data, all the CDC's own numbers, right here for you.
[00:06:08.003 --> 00:06:10.665]  And we've got all the latest as this scam unfolds.
[00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:17.851]  But remember, top pathologists last year came out and said coronavirus is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the unsuspecting public.
[00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:24.161]  That is all coming up as well, and it all ties together.
[00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:31.683]  Meanwhile, we have Town Hall asking the same question I've been asking, and Tucker Carlson's been asking, and so many others have been asking.
[00:06:32.084 --> 00:06:35.725]  Why is the National Guard still in Washington?
[00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:37.786]  And why are the numbers increasing?
[00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:46.989]  Oh, they say it's in case Trump tries to escape during the impeachment trial, when even they admit they don't have the votes to actually convict him.
[00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:51.052]  And they're saying this is really part of a symbol of their power.
[00:06:51.072 --> 00:06:52.492]  That's what MSNBC says.
[00:06:52.552 --> 00:06:54.553]  So going to direct authoritarianism.
[00:06:55.633 --> 00:07:04.995]  We have some really good news and a special report that's up on Bandot Video that we shot last night showing the best highlights of his press conference that will play next segment.
[00:07:06.415 --> 00:07:12.137]  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis does what Trump didn't do and counters what the Democrats are trying to do.
[00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:23.825]  Ron DeSantis launches ambitious crackdown on Big Tech and we've got a bullet point layout of that coming up for you next segment.
[00:07:24.798 --> 00:07:32.681]  Also, FBI confirms two agents killed, three wounded in suspected child porn raid in Florida, but you won't see that in the national news.
[00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:35.043]  You'll only hear the fifth person in U.S.
[00:07:35.083 --> 00:07:39.785]  history laid in state at the Capitol, killed by rioters.
[00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:40.585]  Not true.
[00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:44.707]  So that they can try to act like this was the greatest attack since Pearl Harbor.
[00:07:45.567 --> 00:07:54.015]  And using the sad heart attack slash stroke death of a police officer days after the event as the pretext to claim it was the bloodiest attack in U.S.
[00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:55.396]  history, which it was not.
[00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:58.138]  It paled in significance even compared to football riots.
[00:07:58.519 --> 00:08:03.123]  But people saw the hundreds of thousands outside and equated that with that number attacking.
[00:08:03.563 --> 00:08:06.165]  Very primitive level, a big crowd of people, scary.
[00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:10.249]  And then the idea of all of them attacking is very scary.
[00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:12.211]  Should be scary to tyrants, but they weren't.
[00:08:13.376 --> 00:08:17.959]  So they're projecting that, but careful what they project, careful what they wish for.
[00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:23.322]  They might someday actually get the real thing and not the thing that they provocateured and made up.
[00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:29.025]  Also, SpaceX Starship explodes during high altitude test.
[00:08:29.045 --> 00:08:34.609]  We're going to get to that actually first here in just a moment during this segment.
[00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:37.695]  And more on the sham impeachment trial.
[00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:40.897]  The entire proceeding is legally null.
[00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:41.937]  It's not real.
[00:08:41.997 --> 00:08:44.178]  It's why the Chief Justice Roberts won't be part of it.
[00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:50.181]  Because it's in the Constitution that you can't try a person after they're out of office for impeachment.
[00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:51.282]  Who was the British King?
[00:08:52.062 --> 00:08:55.964]  Something like 20 years after he died, they dug up his body and chopped his head off.
[00:08:56.424 --> 00:08:58.845]  I mean, it's kind of the same type deal.
[00:09:00.558 --> 00:09:17.167]  But the first thing I want to hit is the inbred hatred of America and the hatred of our military and the hatred of our superiority and the hatred of our technology by the envious leftist Hollywood trash class that everyone's trying to run away from.
[00:09:17.287 --> 00:09:23.911]  So the operative that runs the White House basically for Barack Obama, Ms.
[00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:24.992]  Psaki,
[00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:30.325]  Was making fun of Space Force yesterday as if it's a joke and non-existent.
[00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:36.312]  All that is is a name for a 60-year secret space program that's highly advanced.
[00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:40.457]  In the 1970s there were weapons platforms in space.
[00:09:41.553 --> 00:09:52.339]  Robotically controlled with SABO DU rounds in them that could decapitate the entire world leadership of over a hundred countries in a matter of hours.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:10.310]  By 1979, the United States had a complete decapitation weapons platform, more than 20 platforms in space with meteor guns is the classic parlance for it, but it's really a accelerated SABO high energy kinetic weapon.
[00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:14.204]  And it's roughly, depending on the system, it was classified.
[00:10:14.224 --> 00:10:18.388]  They leaked some of it, so the guy that ran the program before he died, Colonel Bob Bowman, was able to tell me about it.
[00:10:18.728 --> 00:10:20.149]  They've had some hearings in Congress submitting it.
[00:10:20.229 --> 00:10:21.470]  It's about a 100-pound sabot.
[00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:23.092]  It's got a rocket engine on it.
[00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:26.215]  It aims from space at whatever target it's going to hit.
[00:10:26.695 --> 00:10:36.324]  It fires a depleted uranium round, and it hits with so much force at 30,000 miles an hour on the ground that it'll kill people in a bunker two miles under a mountain.
[00:10:37.432 --> 00:10:40.894]  They're always under mountains, because you dig two miles under the dirt, it's 150 degrees.
[00:10:41.054 --> 00:10:42.875]  You've got to be under a mountain.
[00:10:42.895 --> 00:10:47.238]  So you've got a two or three mile tall mountain, you put the base at the base of the mountain.
[00:10:47.618 --> 00:10:48.719]  A little bit of inside baseball.
[00:10:49.779 --> 00:11:05.669]  So if in 1979 there were all these platforms of global domination already in space, Trump is just bringing out what was secret, and Psaki makes a joke about it because CNN, ABC News says America's done, America's a wimp, America's a joke, China's the dominant power.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.382]  They're running us down so all the investment moves to China.
[00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:11.363]  They're telling us that America's not open for business.
[00:11:11.863 --> 00:11:16.427]  And then they want the world to not know that America gained military superiority by 1980.
[00:11:17.547 --> 00:11:24.332]  And that's why the Russians figured it out later and gave up officially in 1991, but gave up way before that in the mid-1980s.
[00:11:24.352 --> 00:11:26.374]  And by the way, they put a bunch of weapons in space.
[00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:30.121]  But we sent hunter-killer satellites up there and destroyed them.
[00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.683]  And the Chinese are using particle beams on the ground.
[00:11:32.723 --> 00:11:33.663]  They blow up a lot of our stuff.
[00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:35.124]  There's a space war going on for a long time.
[00:11:35.384 --> 00:11:35.825]  It's ongoing.
[00:11:36.165 --> 00:11:37.446]  And it comes out here, it comes out there.
[00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:44.530]  But this woman is so ignorant and so stupid and such a Harvard bug-eyed moron that she doesn't know any of it.
[00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:47.653]  And of course, we're attacking Elon Musk because another rocket blew up.
[00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:53.674]  Yeah, well, it took NASA a hundred rockets before they got stuff with the Saturn that got into... Saturn rocket that got into space.
[00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:57.456]  Musk only has a couple explosions before he got his heavy Falcon into space.
[00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:59.396]  Better than the Russians, better than what the U.S.
[00:11:59.416 --> 00:11:59.616]  had.
[00:11:59.896 --> 00:12:01.317]  So again, they don't like trial and error.
[00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:03.497]  They don't like America learning.
[00:12:03.537 --> 00:12:04.718]  They don't like any of it.
[00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.058]  They want us done.
[00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:07.178]  They want us to be a joke.
[00:12:07.478 --> 00:12:14.300]  Biden's trying to shut down SpaceX right now because, quote, Elon Musk is discriminating against foreign workers, which is even pure bull.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.881]  The thing is, he hires too many, but he gets the job done.
[00:12:18.157 --> 00:12:21.920]  So, let's go ahead and go to this lady attacking Space Force of which she knows nothing.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.341]  Wow, Space Force.
[00:12:38.122 --> 00:12:39.243]  It's the plane of today.
[00:12:39.263 --> 00:12:42.425]  It is an interesting question.
[00:12:43.246 --> 00:12:47.509]  I am happy to check with our Space Force point of contact.
[00:12:47.529 --> 00:12:48.210]  I'm not sure who that is.
[00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.732]  I will find out and see if we have any update on that.
[00:12:51.352 --> 00:12:52.674]  Go ahead.
[00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:55.256]  Yeah, there's no Space Force, folks.
[00:12:55.656 --> 00:12:56.236]  There's no rockets.
[00:12:56.256 --> 00:12:57.437]  There's no spaceships.
[00:13:04.264 --> 00:13:10.309]  Wernher von Braun in the 30s designed the space shuttle when he was in Nazi Germany that we then developed in the 70s and launched in the 80s.
[00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.711]  But according to them, none of this exists.
[00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:13.152]  No, no.
[00:13:13.772 --> 00:13:16.795]  The Nazis were just firing missiles a thousand miles in 1945.
[00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:19.237]  But there's no technology.
[00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:20.258]  There's no nothing.
[00:13:20.738 --> 00:13:21.539]  Ha ha ha!
[00:13:22.159 --> 00:13:23.620]  Kind of like there's mothers and fathers.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.602]  No, they don't exist either, according to her.
[00:13:26.363 --> 00:13:27.564]  These people are a joke.
[00:13:28.544 --> 00:13:31.107]  And now Biden's FAA wants to shut down
[00:13:32.577 --> 00:13:37.200]  SpaceX, our best space program, because they are enemies of everything pro-human.
[00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:39.262]  The globalists don't want us to get off world.
[00:13:39.582 --> 00:13:45.146]  They want to expunge humanity and merge with machines and become this new AI god we're constantly being told about.
[00:13:46.047 --> 00:13:47.208]  These are crazy people.
[00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:51.231]  Or they're actually in contact with interdimensional extraterrestrials and they've made a deal.
[00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:56.635]  I don't know whether they're crazy or they've made a deal, but they believe they've made a deal with entities.
[00:13:57.295 --> 00:13:59.317]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:00.745]  I can assure you.
[00:14:01.145 --> 00:14:03.306]  You see, Elon Musk talked about that in the establishment.
[00:14:03.786 --> 00:14:04.986]  That's because he knows what's going on.
[00:14:05.026 --> 00:14:10.007]  He said, beware of those that worship AI gods.
[00:14:12.008 --> 00:14:12.648]  There's the headline.
[00:14:12.688 --> 00:14:15.149]  Will Biden's administration slow down SpaceX?
[00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:16.289]  Well, they're sure trying!
[00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:19.970]  Because the Chinese are still trying to get running water and electricity!
[00:14:21.175 --> 00:14:23.536]  And the Islamists are still learning how to use toilet paper!
[00:14:24.137 --> 00:14:25.517]  But America sucks, doesn't it?
[00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:26.738]  That's why everybody wants to get in here.
[00:14:27.478 --> 00:14:28.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:29.359]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:30.580]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.301]  InfoWars.com.
[00:14:32.541 --> 00:14:33.782]  NewsWars.com.
[00:14:34.002 --> 00:14:34.902]  Band.Video.
[00:14:34.963 --> 00:14:35.703]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:14:35.923 --> 00:14:36.323]  Today!
[00:14:36.383 --> 00:14:36.743]  Today!
[00:14:36.804 --> 00:14:37.224]  Today!
[00:14:37.864 --> 00:14:39.925]  And we are back in the fight!
[00:14:40.606 --> 00:14:41.086]  Woo!
[00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:42.907]  Not giving up.
[00:14:43.027 --> 00:14:44.688]  Not rolling over to the New World Order.
[00:14:45.608 --> 00:14:46.389]  The New World Order
[00:14:47.614 --> 00:14:49.875]  Is as popular as a flamethrower in hell!
[00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:50.716]  It's useless!
[00:14:51.316 --> 00:14:55.118]  Freedom is as popular as iced tea in the Sahara Desert, baby!
[00:14:56.098 --> 00:14:58.619]  And a nice Jeep to get you the hell out of there with air conditioning.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.121]  So we're gonna win in the end.
[00:15:02.822 --> 00:15:06.763]  Remember, everything the globalists bring you is pain.
[00:15:07.884 --> 00:15:09.485]  Is being alone, is being dumbed down.
[00:15:09.605 --> 00:15:11.466]  Everything their social media, everything they do
[00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:16.024]  is designed to carry that information out.
[00:15:16.084 --> 00:15:33.507]  And I've got the holy grail of information to destroy and expose the COVID fraud in triplicate here that I'm going to be covering in the last segment of this hour, right here.
[00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:36.087]  All ties together.
[00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:40.648]  But let's shift gears to something that ties to that as well.
[00:15:41.693 --> 00:15:43.494]  I like Governor Ron DeSantis.
[00:15:44.374 --> 00:15:45.995]  He says that COVID's an overblown hoax.
[00:15:46.535 --> 00:15:54.978]  He exposed it in a state where they had hundreds of clinics with thousands of tests a day, 100% positive, and it was all a fraud.
[00:15:56.599 --> 00:16:02.301]  He's been fighting back against the leftists, against their fear-mongering, and he's also come out and did something Trump didn't do.
[00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:12.177]  When I begged him and Laura Loomer begged him, please, before it's too late, before they silence you, before they steal the midterms and the general election, please move against Big Tech.
[00:16:12.717 --> 00:16:13.478]  And he's done it now.
[00:16:14.779 --> 00:16:19.723]  Mandatory opt-outs for Big Tech content filters and solutions to tech censorship.
[00:16:21.462 --> 00:16:26.164]  Private right of action for Florida citizens against tech companies that violate the condition.
[00:16:27.064 --> 00:16:35.447]  Fines of $100,000 per day, he's copying Poland, levied on tech companies that suspend candidates for elected office in Florida from their platforms.
[00:16:35.687 --> 00:16:36.948]  That is total election meddling.
[00:16:37.528 --> 00:16:47.532]  Daily fines for any tech company that uses the content and user-related algorithms to suppress or prioritize the access of any content related to a political candidate or cause on the ballot.
[00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.773]  He's fighting back against the racketeering and election meddling.
[00:16:52.694 --> 00:16:54.415]  Greater transparency requirements.
[00:16:54.676 --> 00:17:00.382]  Disclosed requirements enforced by Florida's election authorities for tech companies that favor one candidate over the other.
[00:17:00.882 --> 00:17:08.049]  Power for the floor attorney general to bring cases against tech companies that violate these conditions under the state's unfair and deceptive trade practices.
[00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.030]  Which it is!
[00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:11.012]  Absolutely!
[00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:21.518]  It's the surveillance, it's the racketeering, it's the letting Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL by the hundreds of thousands of trainees into your private accounts to read your private text messages.
[00:17:21.698 --> 00:17:22.578]  They admit it all!
[00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.520]  And now they're turning the apps on and listening to you.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.521]  Mainstream news, I told you years ago!
[00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:29.802]  Because it was in the patents, now they admit it!
[00:17:31.018 --> 00:17:38.460]  They are just raping us and we've got to wake up out of the trance and say, did we ask for big tech to have us bent over running a train on us?
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.441]  And I'm sorry to use an allegory like that, but that's what's happening and that's what's going on.
[00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:45.521]  So DeSantis is fighting the COVID fraud.
[00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:48.142]  He is fighting the big tech censorship.
[00:17:48.482 --> 00:17:49.762]  And this is the model.
[00:17:49.882 --> 00:17:54.583]  I wish our governor was like this in Texas, but he's on the big tech payroll now.
[00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:57.064]  So sad to watch that happen.
[00:17:57.424 --> 00:17:58.824]  So DeSantis is a real champion.
[00:18:01.684 --> 00:18:06.549]  Trump should have taken action like this previously, but wow, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:11.895]  That puts him in the front-runner seat for 2024, but we don't have time to waste because the lockdown is killing the economy.
[00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:18.822]  Here is part of what Governor DeSantis said in a 45-minute press conference yesterday that's at Infowars.com.
[00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:34.287]  What began as a group of upstart technology companies from the West Coast has since transformed into an industry of monopoly communications platforms that monitor, influence, and control the flow of information in our country and among our citizens.
[00:18:34.587 --> 00:18:38.051]  And they do that to an extent hitherto unimaginable.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:47.748]  At the turn of the 21st century, online technology represented tools to liberate Americans from reliance on distrusted legacy media outlets.
[00:18:48.269 --> 00:18:54.274]  As social media proliferated over the past decade, citizens could directly connect with large numbers of people
[00:18:54.654 --> 00:18:54.894]  Thank you.
[00:19:19.844 --> 00:19:27.393]  We have seen the power of their censorship over individuals and organizations, including what I believe is clear viewpoint discrimination.
[00:19:28.013 --> 00:19:35.101]  As these companies have grown and their influence expanded, big tech has come to look more like Big Brother with each passing day.
[00:19:35.762 --> 00:19:38.064]  But this is 2021, not 1984.
[00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:41.867]  And this is real life, not George Orwell's fiction.
[00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:48.372]  No group of people should exercise such power, especially not tech billionaires in Northern California.
[00:19:48.832 --> 00:19:56.138]  If I had to choose, I'd rather be governed by the first 50 names in the Tallahassee phone book than the CEOs of big tech companies.
[00:19:56.698 --> 00:19:58.500]  If you don't like parlor, then don't read it.
[00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:11.332]  Let's not have those choices made for us, or before long we will have nothing more than someone else's choices imposed upon us by a bunch of monopolies whose core business is to sell advertising.
[00:20:11.872 --> 00:20:22.177]  I'm committed to addressing what may be one of the most pervasive threats to American self-government in the 21st century because I believe in individual rights, privacy rights, and property rights.
[00:20:22.197 --> 00:20:26.479]  Because I trust Floridians to choose which content to consume and which to ignore.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:35.344]  Because I want to preserve Florida's rich, diverse public discourse and not allow corporate-owned, narrative-approved outlets to dominate our voices.
[00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:39.826]  Florida consumers deserve protection for their privacy.
[00:20:40.326 --> 00:20:48.389]  With the help of our legislative partners, we're going to stand together in support of Floridians and put a stop to big tech's practice of preying on consumers.
[00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.391]  Your privacy is important.
[00:20:52.332 --> 00:20:55.014]  Hunter Biden's story was true, okay?
[00:20:55.074 --> 00:20:56.395]  We now know it was true.
[00:20:57.256 --> 00:21:00.778]  And the typical corporate media outlets, they just chose to ignore it.
[00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:02.960]  Obviously, they wanted to beat Trump.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.682]  They had a view on the election.
[00:21:06.002 --> 00:21:07.343]  They didn't want to give it any air.
[00:21:07.704 --> 00:21:16.470]  So we rely on social media to go around that, not let corporate legacy media outlets control the discourse and let us speak.
[00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.212]  So you had the New York Post to run it.
[00:21:18.752 --> 00:21:20.073]  And you couldn't get any traction.
[00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:23.657]  You couldn't get any reach on it because big tech put their thumb on the scale.
[00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:24.698]  So that was true.
[00:21:24.758 --> 00:21:31.684]  What they said at the time, oh, it was, it was, it's a conspiracy or it's based on, on, on hacked information.
[00:21:31.944 --> 00:21:32.745]  Are you kidding me?
[00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:38.690]  You're trying to tell me if there was hacked information that could damage me, you guys wouldn't print it.
[00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:39.892]  Give me a break.
[00:21:39.972 --> 00:21:42.374]  You can whiz on my leg, but don't tell me it's raining.
[00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:46.330]  I watched the whole press conference last night.
[00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.091]  Again, it's on Infowars.com.
[00:21:48.131 --> 00:21:53.374]  In fact, in case they take it off YouTube, post, because they do that to, like, presidents now, senators.
[00:21:53.934 --> 00:21:55.635]  Anything powerful, they take down.
[00:21:55.655 --> 00:22:02.979]  Let's post that to Bandai Video in the Banned Video section, because I bet dollars to donuts they end up banning that speech, because he lays it all out.
[00:22:03.766 --> 00:22:04.506]  They're doing it mass.
[00:22:04.827 --> 00:22:07.328]  Remember just a year ago, they went, oh, we're not censoring anyone.
[00:22:07.388 --> 00:22:09.989]  Now they go, well, yes, we're censoring everybody for your own good.
[00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.112]  And CNN goes, well, it's good to take Tucker Carlson off the air and Alex Jones.
[00:22:15.373 --> 00:22:17.894]  So these people are just making a major move.
[00:22:18.074 --> 00:22:20.175]  Oh, I guess it's already up on Bandai Video.
[00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:23.417]  Governor DeSantis lays out plan to crack down a big tech cartel.
[00:22:23.897 --> 00:22:26.499]  Oh, no, that's my... How long's the video?
[00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:26.879]  Let me see.
[00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:28.420]  Put the cursor over it for me, please.
[00:22:29.625 --> 00:22:31.635]  Yeah, no, that is the full speech.
[00:22:31.675 --> 00:22:33.664]  Well, great job, team!
[00:22:34.741 --> 00:22:36.842]  That's special reports there already.
[00:22:37.122 --> 00:22:38.022]  That's why I love Rob Dew.
[00:22:38.042 --> 00:22:40.943]  I mean, he just always, like, does something before I even ask him to do it.
[00:22:40.963 --> 00:22:44.725]  He always goes that extra mile because he knows these people are screwing over him and his family.
[00:22:45.165 --> 00:22:49.787]  Me and Rob were up here until, like, I was up until, like, 6 last night and, uh, shooting that report.
[00:22:49.827 --> 00:22:52.748]  I guess he stayed up here even longer and put that up, so great job doing that.
[00:22:52.768 --> 00:22:54.348]  But let's share it now, folks.
[00:22:54.408 --> 00:22:55.129]  Let's share it.
[00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:57.850]  We have to build our own networks to get around the censors.
[00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.451]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, they're all blocking everything, but we have our own base.
[00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:03.672]  Band.Video.
[00:23:04.392 --> 00:23:05.233]  We're good to go.
[00:23:26.223 --> 00:23:28.964]  Telecommunications and all the different censorship that was taking place.
[00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:31.986]  And there they were in the committees talking about Alex Jones.
[00:23:32.546 --> 00:23:33.566]  Talking about Laura Loomer.
[00:23:34.187 --> 00:23:35.267]  Talking about Donald Trump.
[00:23:37.048 --> 00:23:39.529]  And saying, oh, when we silence somebody, that's not censorship.
[00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:45.472]  And there was Laura Loomer saying, please, Mr. President, act now before they steal the midterm.
[00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.192]  Act now before they silence you!
[00:23:47.212 --> 00:23:50.374]  And it was very prophetic.
[00:23:50.414 --> 00:23:52.375]  And then the Democrat, sounding like Porky Pig,
[00:23:53.544 --> 00:23:55.646]  Tried to even silence her and talk over her.
[00:23:55.686 --> 00:23:59.429]  Here it is.
[00:23:59.489 --> 00:24:02.051]  Mr. Dorsey, you are lying about censoring conservatives.
[00:24:02.092 --> 00:24:05.715]  You are caught on tape by Project Veritas shadowbanning people.
[00:24:05.955 --> 00:24:06.956]  You are censoring people.
[00:24:06.996 --> 00:24:07.776]  You censored me.
[00:24:07.796 --> 00:24:08.837]  You censored Milo.
[00:24:08.877 --> 00:24:11.119]  You censored Chuck Johnson, James O'Keefe.
[00:24:11.159 --> 00:24:15.884]  You even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account for a few minutes.
[00:24:15.904 --> 00:24:19.707]  You are censoring conservatives, and I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[00:24:20.107 --> 00:24:30.052]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late, because Jack Dorsey is trying to influence the election, to sway the election, so that the Democrats can steal the election.
[00:24:30.412 --> 00:24:34.194]  That is why he is censoring and shadowbanning conservatives.
[00:24:34.254 --> 00:24:36.295]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey.
[00:24:36.335 --> 00:24:37.776]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey.
[00:24:37.796 --> 00:24:39.397]  You unverified me on November 15, 2017.
[00:24:39.497 --> 00:24:42.539]  Officer, will you escort this young lady out, please?
[00:24:49.602 --> 00:24:50.562]  You can hear.
[00:24:50.602 --> 00:24:52.323]  Please, before it's too late, Mr. President,
[00:25:18.482 --> 00:25:19.242]  Take action.
[00:25:19.803 --> 00:25:21.603]  Do something about this.
[00:25:22.524 --> 00:25:40.750]  And now we finally see your governor, DeSantis, I wish the Texas governor was like this, cracking down and saying, this is racketeering, it's election meddling, it's organized crime, they're working in concert, they're surveilling people, they're taking candidates' websites away, they're taking members of Congress' away, or their pages, they're blocking the former president.
[00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:41.791]  This is incredible.
[00:25:41.851 --> 00:25:47.613]  So wow, Laura Loomer, total vindication, but I don't think it's, it's not very sweet to be vindicated, is it?
[00:25:49.069 --> 00:25:51.070]  Well, it's a bit bittersweet, right, Alex?
[00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.073]  But, uh, you know, you said that that was a Democrat who auctioned me off.
[00:25:55.153 --> 00:25:56.453]  It was actually a Republican.
[00:25:56.473 --> 00:25:57.474]  I thought I forgot.
[00:25:58.211 --> 00:26:00.111]  I'm from Missouri, which makes it even worse.
[00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:07.753]  And you would think that it was a Democrat because, you know, this hearing, and you were sitting right next to me when this happened, this was taking place at the same time as the Kavanaugh hearings.
[00:26:07.813 --> 00:26:19.595]  And it was funny because during the Kavanaugh hearings, you had Republicans and you had Chuck Grassley saying, oh, it's okay, these women who are coming in and protesting, doused in period blood and screaming and destroying property, that's their free speech right.
[00:26:19.875 --> 00:26:22.715]  But as soon as I do it, right, it was a Republican who shut me down.
[00:26:22.755 --> 00:26:25.576]  And that's, but that's what we're seeing right now in the Republican Party is,
[00:26:25.996 --> 00:26:37.944]  You know, you take somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene or myself, you know, candidates who ran for office and had very successful campaigns, raised a lot of money, and it's the Republicans that are trying to silence us more than the Democrats.
[00:26:38.385 --> 00:26:44.129]  You know, I forgot that that guy was a Republican, or I guess I always thought he was a Democrat because he looks like a child molester.
[00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:48.372]  I'm not saying he's a child molester, he just has that Brian Stelter-esque look, but I mean,
[00:26:50.398 --> 00:26:51.400]  And I'm not joking, folks, though.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.062]  I mean, I am joking, but he's probably on a pedophile.
[00:26:53.082 --> 00:26:57.127]  I'm just saying, these people look creepy, and it's not right to make physical comments.
[00:26:57.227 --> 00:27:01.153]  It's just that they're raping our freedom, and I'm so tired of it.
[00:27:01.393 --> 00:27:05.098]  There's a big article out, the rise of the GOP posters.
[00:27:05.859 --> 00:27:26.657]  Caucus and they attack you they attack me and they say oh my gosh And we also have Mitch McConnell coming out saying if we allow these new women that got elected as Republicans that you just talked about To be the new face our party's dead, but she won in Georgia as you just said by 75% so it looks like they're scared of our populist movement actually taking over and winning
[00:27:27.847 --> 00:27:28.928]  Yeah, they definitely are.
[00:27:29.168 --> 00:27:40.598]  And although this article is published in The Verge, which is a leftist publication, they give me and you credit for changing the energy in the Republican Party.
[00:27:40.918 --> 00:27:54.610]  And so if you read this article, they say that that day in Congress, when I confronted Jack Dorsey, when you were there and you got into it with Marco Rubio, which they mentioned as well, they said that that activist energy was so viral that it caused
[00:27:54.790 --> 00:27:55.110]  We're good to go.
[00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:40.434]  You know, one of the one of the best benefits of this is that we've inspired other people as well to be more aggressive in their tactics so that we can, you know, force the nationalist and populist narrative into Congress and drive out the rhinos.
[00:28:42.596 --> 00:28:45.918]  Looking at this, because it's not about, oh, look, there's an article about Laura Loomer and Alex Jones.
[00:28:45.938 --> 00:28:46.879]  There's hundreds of these a week.
[00:28:47.019 --> 00:28:49.161]  This one actually tells the truth, though, and they admit
[00:28:50.233 --> 00:29:12.105]  That was that viral activism that has now been a chain reaction that myself and you and others have really pioneered in the modern sense of not just screaming out one-line slogans like Code Pink, but actually confronting people with real issues and going to hearings where we're being discussed and saying we have a right to face our accusers like I did with Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey and so many others.
[00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:29.634]  That they're scared of that happening, and that's one reason they did the whole COVID lockdown, was Congress was horrified because so many other regular citizens were going to the Senate buildings, the House buildings, because most of the hearings folks aren't in the Capitol, and actually going and peacefully confronting their supposed elected servants.
[00:29:30.765 --> 00:29:34.107]  Right, and that's what Loomering's all about.
[00:29:35.428 --> 00:29:47.575]  It was kind of frowned upon before, but now we have emboldened everyday people, everyday Americans, to use their social media, to use their cell phones, to confront politicians and hold them accountable.
[00:29:48.095 --> 00:29:50.457]  And gone are the days of the people just
[00:29:50.757 --> 00:29:57.685]  You know, being complicit and treating these politicians like royalty who ought to never be questioned or confronted.
[00:29:58.426 --> 00:30:09.138]  You know, you see it every single day, whether it's the woman in New York who, you know, ripped Chuck Schumer a new one or it's you confronting Marco Rubio or me, you know.
[00:30:10.099 --> 00:30:13.021]  Confronting Congress and Jack Dorsey during the hearing.
[00:30:13.141 --> 00:30:19.546]  Everyday people are being emboldened and the reason why the GOP is freaking out is because they want to control everybody.
[00:30:19.566 --> 00:30:35.157]  And when you have inspiring people, especially an inspiring woman like Marjorie Taylor Greene or, you know, a candidate like myself here in Florida, it emboldens other people and it gives them that same type of energy and confidence to run for office themselves.
[00:30:35.297 --> 00:30:37.058]  And the GOP is
[00:30:37.506 --> 00:30:45.312]  is scared that they're not going to be able to control all of the candidates and keep them on a tight leash, which is, you know, what they've traditionally always done.
[00:30:45.753 --> 00:30:49.416]  When you run for office, you know, you're expected to kiss Kevin McCarthy's ass.
[00:30:49.736 --> 00:30:53.479]  You're expected to do everything right so that you get put on the NRCC list.
[00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.160]  Well, you know what?
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.104]  I did everything right, and I outperformed most of the people, if not all of them, who were put on their little list.
[00:30:59.364 --> 00:31:01.846]  Some people who were put on their list didn't even win their primaries.
[00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:06.970]  I won my primary while being totally banned and raised $2.5 million on my own with the help of the American people.
[00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:11.753]  And got your name recognition up even more in Florida, so you're going to end up winning a seat in the near future.
[00:31:12.133 --> 00:31:13.354]  You are the woman in the arena.
[00:31:13.394 --> 00:31:14.715]  You're the example of what we need to do.
[00:31:14.735 --> 00:31:19.459]  Now, they're so scared of you, though, Laura, because they admit you're one of the first dominoes to fall.
[00:31:19.479 --> 00:31:22.140]  This isn't about, oh, bragging about Laura, bragging about Alex Jones.
[00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:23.822]  You get attacked.
[00:31:24.718 --> 00:31:30.004]  When you're the first to be the shock troops going over the barbed wire and the information war, she has been even more banned than I have.
[00:31:30.104 --> 00:31:33.527]  Bank accounts, Uber, Airbnb.
[00:31:33.848 --> 00:31:35.309]  When she came back into the U.S.
[00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:41.476]  from a visit to Central America, during all this, they pulled her aside, interrogated her about her political views, brought up her Wikipedia.
[00:31:41.836 --> 00:31:45.079]  Now she's been put on the no-gun-buy list, the red flag.
[00:31:45.979 --> 00:31:49.923]  That is totally unconstitutional and ties into this new bill, H.R.
[00:31:51.245 --> 00:31:49.923]  127.
[00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:53.387]  When we come back, we'll talk about that with Laura Loomer.
[00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:57.371]  Please don't forget, listeners, without you, we're not going to stay on air.
[00:31:58.444 --> 00:31:59.786]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:31:59.826 --> 00:32:01.227]  We have great new t-shirts in.

[00:32:40.962 --> 00:32:42.463]  So Ultra 12, back in stock.
[00:32:42.503 --> 00:32:44.164]  DNA 4 is about to sell out.
[00:32:44.685 --> 00:32:46.306]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:32:47.186 --> 00:32:49.608]  And without you, we will not be on air.
[00:32:49.628 --> 00:32:52.691]  So please keep us in your prayers because we are under attack.
[00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:55.373]  Because everything we've talked about is now coming true.
[00:32:55.413 --> 00:32:58.096]  So we'll come back and talk about gun confiscation.
[00:32:58.156 --> 00:32:59.637]  It's officially in the bill.
[00:33:00.418 --> 00:33:01.499]  The new order isn't coming.
[00:33:02.459 --> 00:33:02.840]  It's here.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.544]  But if we stay on air and if we raise the alarm, you're going to see other action by folks like DeSantis.
[00:33:08.985 --> 00:33:13.469]  This is the end of our elaborate plans.
[00:33:17.805 --> 00:33:20.066]  Anthony Comey is coming up at 15 minutes to the next hour.
[00:33:20.086 --> 00:33:24.669]  I'm gonna break the most devastating evidence of COVID being a total fraud.
[00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:30.632]  That'll absolutely turn the tide and defeat the New World Order in the first and second segments of the next hour.
[00:33:31.532 --> 00:33:34.674]  But earlier, I told the crew just real fast, I said, hey, get a clip of Laura Loomer.
[00:33:36.459 --> 00:33:44.401]  Two and a half years ago, warning President Trump, laying everything out in Congress and being talked over, and they just real fast grabbed a clip that was so many dozens of versions it was a bad one.
[00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:46.862]  Not their fault, my fault for not telling them ten minutes before.
[00:33:47.362 --> 00:33:50.763]  So, we actually found a better res copy of this.
[00:33:50.843 --> 00:33:56.184]  It's very historical, it's very important, and the globalists have really talked about this as the chain reaction.
[00:33:56.544 --> 00:33:58.464]  This scared the corrupt lawmakers so much.
[00:33:58.484 --> 00:34:04.486]  They'd invite the communists and Code Pink and, you know, all the other Black Lives Matter to block them.
[00:34:05.604 --> 00:34:09.411]  The hallways and attack people and do all that, they're wonderful.
[00:34:09.952 --> 00:34:11.555]  But when you just speak up, you're a terrorist.
[00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:13.982]  And then, of course, she had the so-called Capitol attack.
[00:34:14.262 --> 00:34:19.043]  They killed four of our people who stupidly went in, but they weren't terrorists.
[00:34:19.063 --> 00:34:20.644]  And then one cop died later of a heart attack.
[00:34:20.904 --> 00:34:26.846]  They're now saying it was the ultimate attack, worse than Pearl Harbor, as bad as 9-11, just insane garbage.
[00:34:27.066 --> 00:34:33.148]  And now they have permanent troops, they're saying, in D.C., and they're going to use the CIA against Americans, and they're going to take our guns.
[00:34:33.188 --> 00:34:34.629]  And it's now happened to Laura Loomer.
[00:34:34.689 --> 00:34:38.990]  So they are so afraid of women who are smart and well-spoken standing up.
[00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.531]  And here's what she actually had to say.
[00:34:43.353 --> 00:34:45.615]  You are caught on tape by Project Veritas.
[00:34:45.935 --> 00:34:46.936]  Shadowbanning people.
[00:34:47.217 --> 00:34:48.197]  You are censoring people.
[00:34:48.257 --> 00:34:48.978]  You censored me.
[00:34:48.998 --> 00:34:50.099]  You censored my love.
[00:34:50.119 --> 00:34:51.660]  You censored Chuck Johnson.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.381]  James O'Keefe.
[00:34:52.421 --> 00:34:56.685]  You even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account for a few minutes.
[00:34:57.125 --> 00:35:01.007]  You are censoring conservatives, and I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[00:35:01.367 --> 00:35:11.332]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late, because Jack Dorsey is trying to influence the election, to sway the election so that the Democrats can steal the election.
[00:35:11.672 --> 00:35:14.994]  That is why he is censoring and shadow banning conservatives.
[00:35:15.514 --> 00:35:17.555]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey.
[00:35:17.595 --> 00:35:19.036]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey.
[00:35:19.056 --> 00:35:20.917]  You unverified me on November 15, 2017.
[00:35:23.578 --> 00:35:29.044]  Officer, will you escort this young lady out, please?
[00:35:29.184 --> 00:35:30.666]  Stop the bias!
[00:35:30.706 --> 00:35:35.591]  We are conservative Americans, not Russian bots, Jack Dorsey!
[00:35:35.992 --> 00:35:36.773]  Stop the bias!
[00:35:38.502 --> 00:35:40.403]  By the way, I'm just springing this on you guys.
[00:35:40.423 --> 00:35:43.205]  Can you guys pull up Owen Schroer gets arrested at the Capitol?
[00:35:43.785 --> 00:35:44.986]  He's out in the front area.
[00:35:45.006 --> 00:35:46.286]  He has tape over his mouth.
[00:35:46.366 --> 00:35:49.748]  They say no protest to take him to jail because Democrats ordered it.
[00:35:49.848 --> 00:35:51.869]  But Democrats, again, can be as violent as they want.
[00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.271]  This is an incredible double standard, Laura.
[00:35:56.772 --> 00:35:58.173]  No, it definitely is.
[00:35:58.393 --> 00:36:07.058]  And people listening to the video, they may wonder, well, why didn't Laura mention Alex Jones in the list of names when she was talking about who he'd censored?
[00:36:07.458 --> 00:36:07.638]  Well,
[00:36:08.539 --> 00:36:13.722]  During this hearing, they were asking Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg whether they censor conservatives.
[00:36:13.962 --> 00:36:18.764]  And the very next day, Alex Jones, you of course, were banned from Twitter, if you recall.
[00:36:19.044 --> 00:36:24.347]  So it was the day after this hearing, exactly to the day that you were banned.
[00:36:24.447 --> 00:36:30.190]  And so they had spent the entire day lying to Congress, okay, committing perjury, saying that they don't censor people.
[00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:37.834]  And then just to basically give everybody a big middle finger, they banned Infowars and Alex Jones the day after this hearing.
[00:36:39.312 --> 00:36:42.639]  Now let's talk about something that is so scary.
[00:36:42.859 --> 00:36:44.964]  And by scary, it makes me so mad I get scared.
[00:36:45.946 --> 00:36:46.788]  Because I read the bill.
[00:36:47.597 --> 00:36:48.758]  I read the whole thing.
[00:36:49.318 --> 00:36:50.099]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:36:50.799 --> 00:36:51.460]  H.R.
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.582]  127, a new bill in Congress would literally end the Second Amendment rights permanently.
[00:36:55.622 --> 00:37:02.187]  Michael Snyder of EndOfTheAmericanDream.com is not exaggerating the stories on InfoWars.com when he says it.
[00:37:02.727 --> 00:37:03.588]  I've read the whole bill.
[00:37:04.268 --> 00:37:12.714]  House bill would require psych test, liability insurance for gun ownership, implement mass retroactive registry, of course, for the confiscation.
[00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:14.355]  So no judge, no jury.
[00:37:14.735 --> 00:37:17.776]  The leftist psychiatry system is now in psychology systems of control.
[00:37:18.296 --> 00:37:18.997]  I've read the bill.
[00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:23.659]  Let me show you some of the subsections here, so you understand that we're not kidding.
[00:37:24.919 --> 00:37:27.140]  Firearm registration system.
[00:37:29.381 --> 00:37:32.203]  Number one, require information under the firearm registry system.
[00:37:32.223 --> 00:37:39.266]  The owner of a firearm shall transmit to the Bureau, and it goes on to say, retroactively, all firearms be registered and handed in those documents to them.
[00:37:41.107 --> 00:37:52.311]  It goes on to say, uh, general license, except and otherwise provision of the subsection, the attorney general shall issue an individual a license to possess a firearm and ammunition of the individual.
[00:37:52.331 --> 00:37:54.412]  It's a federal license to own guns.
[00:37:54.812 --> 00:37:56.473]  I mean, wow, this is crazy.
[00:37:57.653 --> 00:37:59.174]  And then it goes into everything you've got to do.
[00:37:59.194 --> 00:38:00.854]  You have to go through the psychiatry check.
[00:38:01.014 --> 00:38:02.955]  Anybody can complain, you lose your guns.
[00:38:03.435 --> 00:38:04.856]  Psychological evaluation.
[00:38:07.247 --> 00:38:12.213]  The evaluation is conducted in compliance with such standards as shall be established by the Attorney General.
[00:38:12.454 --> 00:38:15.678]  So it's just an open end to the Attorney General's God, and it's all regulatory.
[00:38:15.698 --> 00:38:18.642]  I mean, this is so bad, I can't even explain it to you.
[00:38:18.682 --> 00:38:23.688]  Here it is, it has a chronic mental illness or disturbance or brain disease referred to in the subparagraph.
[00:38:23.708 --> 00:38:25.451]  So now you got Parkinson's, you can't own a gun.
[00:38:26.887 --> 00:38:28.508]  Is addicted or a controlled substance.
[00:38:28.548 --> 00:38:30.429]  So, oh, you've been getting medical marijuana?
[00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:32.130]  Attorney General can just say you can't have it.
[00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:40.854]  Has attempted to commit suicide or prior psychological treatment or evaluation of an individual indicated that the individual engaged in conduct that posed a danger to self or others.
[00:38:41.094 --> 00:38:42.655]  She got in a fist fight a few years ago.
[00:38:43.035 --> 00:38:43.636]  And it goes on.
[00:38:43.656 --> 00:38:45.657]  But it just gives them open-ended total power.
[00:38:45.697 --> 00:38:46.637]  Let's talk about Laura Loomer.
[00:38:46.677 --> 00:38:47.498]  No criminal record.
[00:38:48.809 --> 00:38:52.137]  Upstanding lady, you have now been put on the red flag.
[00:38:52.177 --> 00:38:57.549]  You cannot buy a gun, and it's just, there's no judge, no jury, just talk to the hand, tell folks what just happened to you.
[00:38:58.652 --> 00:39:12.058]  Yeah, so this happened during my congressional campaign and I didn't release it because I've been getting a lot of death threats and the security risks during my campaign were already big enough that I was also waiting to release this information.
[00:39:12.399 --> 00:39:14.760]  So during my campaign, I applied for a concealed carry.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:23.764]  At the time, I already had a gun because in the state of Florida, you don't need to have a license to have a gun and you only need a concealed carry if you plan on carrying your gun.
[00:39:24.064 --> 00:39:26.185]  So I had a gun at my place, right?
[00:39:26.245 --> 00:39:26.945]  I'm allowed to do that.
[00:39:26.985 --> 00:39:27.606]  I'm allowed to have a gun.
[00:39:28.687 --> 00:39:32.770]  When I applied for my concealed carry permit, I received a letter in the mail that said it was denied.
[00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:37.834]  But then they said, if you want to appeal this or you think a mistake was made, you can appeal it.
[00:39:38.114 --> 00:39:44.059]  So then I appealed and had them re-review my application, and then I got another letter back saying that it was denied.
[00:39:44.139 --> 00:39:47.142]  And then they have another form that you fill out where you ask why.
[00:39:47.542 --> 00:39:53.307]  Then a couple weeks later, I got that letter that you just showed that said that people
[00:39:55.037 --> 00:40:01.481]  Who are on the NICS database, federally prohibited from owning firearms, cannot have concealed carry permits.
[00:40:01.801 --> 00:40:06.023]  So this isn't just a concealed carry permit denial.
[00:40:06.303 --> 00:40:15.889]  This is a letter saying that because my name is in the NICS database, which is controlled by the FBI, the FBI is the only organization that can put your name in this database.
[00:40:16.389 --> 00:40:18.310]  I am not allowed to possess a firearm.
[00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.871]  I am not allowed to own a firearm.
[00:40:20.271 --> 00:40:21.733]  And like I said, I had a gun.
[00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:28.021]  So nobody told me that I was on this list, and the only reason I found out is because I applied for a concealed carry.
[00:40:28.401 --> 00:40:38.514]  If I were to have just said, eh, whatever, I guess I don't really need a concealed carry and not have asked for a further review and then followed up again to ask why, I would still have the gun.
[00:40:39.867 --> 00:40:50.721]  I'll be on the federal prohibition list through NYX, and then what would happen if I got doorstopped by the FBI the same way they've been harassing Trump supporters ahead of the events on the Capitol on the 6th?
[00:40:56.908 --> 00:40:57.889]  You don't have any felonies.
[00:40:57.909 --> 00:40:58.650]  You're not a criminal.
[00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:00.772]  They did this while you're running for Congress.
[00:41:01.072 --> 00:41:01.852]  Super popular.
[00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:04.214]  While they're trying to ban you, President Trump tweeting about you.
[00:41:04.474 --> 00:41:05.655]  President Trump voted for you.
[00:41:06.176 --> 00:41:07.056]  They're scared of you.
[00:41:07.617 --> 00:41:08.638]  And they know you're getting death threats.
[00:41:08.658 --> 00:41:10.319]  We're not going to get into all the stuff that's happening behind the scenes.
[00:41:10.339 --> 00:41:11.420]  People coming to your house and things.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.602]  Or how they beat up Roger Stone's wife a few weeks ago.
[00:41:13.622 --> 00:41:14.622]  I mean, this is bad, okay?
[00:41:15.283 --> 00:41:16.704]  And so all this is unfolding.
[00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:17.705]  You're in the devil's den.
[00:41:18.786 --> 00:41:19.746]  Going up against them.
[00:41:20.787 --> 00:41:22.228]  And so what they're put in H.R.
[00:41:22.428 --> 00:41:25.191]  127 that they say they've got the votes to pass in the House at least.
[00:41:26.332 --> 00:41:35.420]  Is putting in law this open power of the Attorney General or the FBI to just ban anybody, but they're already doing it by fiat to you and countless others.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:36.441]  This is criminal.
[00:41:36.701 --> 00:41:38.463]  They need congressional hearings on this.
[00:41:38.743 --> 00:41:41.145]  This is way worse than them banning you off the internet.
[00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:42.066]  That's bad enough.
[00:41:42.106 --> 00:41:43.587]  This is insane.
[00:41:43.647 --> 00:41:46.029]  This is... What are your lawyers saying?
[00:41:46.049 --> 00:41:50.053]  You've got lawyers of the recourse of some magic group just puts you in some list.
[00:41:51.104 --> 00:42:05.216]  Well I've been told and some of the information because I've been doing some research into this and some of the statistics that you know I found is that you know the federally denied persons file is compiled of individuals that are predetermined to have firearm prohibitions without listing a specific category.
[00:42:05.516 --> 00:42:06.477]  So this is their way of
[00:42:06.997 --> 00:42:11.104]  Putting you in a database without it showing what the reason is.
[00:42:11.164 --> 00:42:18.214]  So if you have a vindictive or politically charged FBI agent who doesn't like you and we see that the FBI has become weaponized to attack you.
[00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:21.319]  And again, they don't have to tell you in the SWAT team you're saying you've got guns!
[00:42:22.082 --> 00:42:28.864]  Right, so imagine if somebody were to maliciously have my place swatted, right, when I didn't know that I was on this list.
[00:42:29.184 --> 00:42:38.807]  The feds would have shown up, SWAT team would have probably raided my home, found a gun, and then I could have found myself in prison for four to ten years for a firearms felony when no one let me know.
[00:42:39.508 --> 00:42:44.089]  How many Americans are getting set up to have firearms felony charges because they're on this list?
[00:42:44.249 --> 00:42:45.710]  All right, stay there, stay there.
[00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:50.094]  This is one of the few areas Trump did bad, at least giving lip service to it, he thought would due process.
[00:42:50.354 --> 00:42:53.076]  That's why he was found to be, you know, certified schizophrenic or something.
[00:42:53.096 --> 00:42:54.517]  No, this is not due process.
[00:42:54.537 --> 00:42:59.021]  Let's do five more minutes, and then I'll hit the really huge COVID news, and then Anthony Comey will join us.
[00:42:59.041 --> 00:43:07.128]  But I want to go to break for two minutes, come back and talk more about this with you, and also play a clip from the past when I confronted Sundar Pichai at the Capitol.
[00:43:07.628 --> 00:43:12.632]  Remember back when we didn't wear masks, back when you could actually go places, do things before you were locked down under globalist martial law.
[00:43:12.652 --> 00:43:13.813]  But folks, you can fight back!
[00:43:14.373 --> 00:43:22.419]  Tell everybody you know about the local radio station you're listening to, local TV station, local cable station, and spread the word about infowars.com forward slash show and band dot video.
[00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:24.060]  That's how you circumvent the censors.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.521]  That's how you raise the alarm.
[00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:26.442]  It's beyond critical.
[00:43:26.702 --> 00:43:27.142]  Stay with us.
[00:43:29.104 --> 00:43:33.247]  They're now erecting a permanent wall around the Capitol and saying troops will probably never leave.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.243]  And they're announcing on every channel a new war against gun owners, conservatives, and Trump supporters.
[00:43:39.404 --> 00:43:41.406]  They're a foreign-backed takeover operation.
[00:43:42.407 --> 00:43:43.167]  It happened in Russia.
[00:43:43.207 --> 00:43:43.948]  It happened in Germany.
[00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:47.451]  It happened in Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea.
[00:43:47.591 --> 00:43:48.472]  It happened in China.
[00:43:49.373 --> 00:43:50.794]  It's happened almost everywhere before.
[00:43:51.494 --> 00:43:52.375]  Now it's happening here.
[00:43:53.216 --> 00:43:54.697]  Bonafide criminal takeover.
[00:43:57.139 --> 00:44:02.304]  Right around the same time, two and a half years ago, here I am confronting Sundar Pichai in a hearing where they talked about me.
[00:44:03.097 --> 00:44:07.019]  Before I even got there, they were attacking me, and after, but I wasn't allowed to face my accuser.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.381]  Here's some of the video.
[00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:27.390]  Sundar, you know Google is helping China with Dragonfly, and you know they're helping censor, and you know they've sold this country out, and you won't even help the Pentagon, you'll help the Chai Khans.
[00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:29.411]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar!
[00:44:30.991 --> 00:44:32.232]  Here he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:32.252 --> 00:44:33.773]  That guy has had to leave this whole Congress without censoring.
[00:44:33.814 --> 00:44:34.454]  He's a lie to Congress.
[00:44:34.514 --> 00:44:37.697]  He's going to be arrested just like that Chinese spy got arrested in Canada two weeks ago.
[00:44:38.237 --> 00:44:39.899]  All these people are here for the picture.
[00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:54.926]  Sundar, you know you're not an American because you can't work with communist Chinese.
[00:44:54.946 --> 00:44:57.007]  You can't work with communist Chinese, Sundar.
[00:44:57.588 --> 00:45:01.870]  You can't work with communist Chinese on dragonfly censoring and rounding up the dissidents.
[00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.092]  Sundar is arresting dissidents in China.
[00:45:04.112 --> 00:45:07.074]  Apple is working with China to suppress their people.
[00:45:07.854 --> 00:45:10.155]  Sundar, you're engaged in treason.
[00:45:10.175 --> 00:45:13.637]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress that you're not censoring conservatives.
[00:45:14.257 --> 00:45:16.058]  Sundar, you will not silence the people.
[00:45:17.578 --> 00:45:20.380]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.822]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people and gaming your search results.
[00:45:26.462 --> 00:45:28.043]  Google is evil.
[00:45:28.883 --> 00:45:30.064]  Google is evil.
[00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:31.024]  Google is evil.
[00:45:32.944 --> 00:45:34.866]  But Loomer.com is her website.
[00:45:34.886 --> 00:45:36.168]  That's where you find Laura Loomer.
[00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:36.948]  Loomer.com.
[00:45:37.009 --> 00:45:38.250]  You find us at Infowars.com.
[00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.991]  I know you know that.
[00:45:39.231 --> 00:45:39.792]  Tell others.
[00:45:39.832 --> 00:45:40.813]  Go back to the URLs.
[00:45:41.133 --> 00:45:42.074]  Circumvent Big Tech.
[00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:42.855]  We warned everybody.
[00:45:42.895 --> 00:45:43.476]  Now we're here.
[00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:47.640]  Laura Loomer is here with us in closing in the three minutes we have.
[00:45:48.341 --> 00:45:49.542]  So, this is a big deal.
[00:45:50.489 --> 00:45:52.632]  We need Governor DeSantis.
[00:45:52.672 --> 00:45:56.997]  We need a congressperson to champion you and this red flag law.
[00:45:57.017 --> 00:45:57.678]  It's the right thing to do.
[00:45:57.718 --> 00:45:58.799]  It'll be incredibly popular.
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:04.566]  The fact that the Justice Department is quietly trying to do this is so incredibly criminal and now trying to codify it in law.
[00:46:04.586 --> 00:46:06.028]  At least they're trying to do that now.
[00:46:06.048 --> 00:46:06.088]  H.R. 127.
[00:46:08.669 --> 00:46:08.849]  Right.
[00:46:09.129 --> 00:46:15.054]  Well, you know, I've been in communication with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is a friend of mine.
[00:46:15.595 --> 00:46:17.997]  And she, of course, has been an advocate for me.
[00:46:18.197 --> 00:46:19.778]  And she thinks this is egregious.
[00:46:19.898 --> 00:46:22.840]  And, you know, this is something that she's committed to fighting.
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:30.907]  And during a town hall in Georgia the other day, she was on video using, you know, my deplatforming and now this illegal red flagging.
[00:46:31.807 --> 00:46:38.710]  You see the bill that you have there, right?
[00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:47.613]  Did you know that one-third, one in three Americans at some time in their life, they will take antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication for whatever?
[00:46:47.913 --> 00:46:54.019]  So when they're telling like, oh, psychiatric evaluations, that's one third of the country right there that is going to be banned from having guns.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:58.484]  Now they're going to deem 75 to 80 million Americans as domestic terrorists.
[00:46:58.524 --> 00:47:01.487]  Well, when you're deemed a domestic terrorist, you're not allowed to have guns.
[00:47:01.827 --> 00:47:09.916]  So how many hundreds of millions of people is that in the American public who are now, if this bill goes forward, federally prohibited from ever owning a gun?
[00:47:10.516 --> 00:47:11.937]  And take Congresswoman Greene.
[00:47:11.977 --> 00:47:27.523]  She's a great lady, wonderful, strong, and they want to expel her and reverse her 75% landslide she won with the biggest margin of any Republican because people are sick and tired and they're upset and the globalists are scared and they think outlawing our speech is going to make us go away.
[00:47:27.803 --> 00:47:28.864]  It's not, is it, Laura?
[00:47:29.949 --> 00:47:31.529]  No, it's definitely not.
[00:47:31.889 --> 00:47:35.050]  And, you know, we need more people to start speaking out about this.
[00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:43.212]  And if the RINOs and the GOP are not willing to get behind efforts to cancel cancel culture, then they themselves need to be canceled.
[00:47:43.692 --> 00:47:50.653]  If they are not going to support Marjorie Taylor Greene and realize that our own party is having a revolution, then it's time to cancel the establishment.
[00:47:50.673 --> 00:47:51.473]  Well, that's the good news.
[00:47:51.573 --> 00:47:54.574]  Polls out of, real polls out of Cheney's district.
[00:47:55.775 --> 00:47:57.516]  Wyoming, Montana, it all mixes together.
[00:47:58.317 --> 00:47:59.458]  Same beautiful God's country.
[00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:02.380]  She has a 9% approval rating now.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.041]  So absolutely, we have the power.
[00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:05.362]  Trump's more popular now than ever.
[00:48:05.642 --> 00:48:07.124]  It blew up in their face, they stole the election.
[00:48:07.424 --> 00:48:08.224]  Loomer.com.
[00:48:08.404 --> 00:48:09.906]  Laura, we really appreciate you.
[00:48:10.906 --> 00:48:11.707]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[00:48:11.727 --> 00:48:12.508]  Thanks for having me on.
[00:48:12.528 --> 00:48:14.209]  A lot of great stuff at Loomer.com.
[00:48:14.629 --> 00:48:16.831]  All right, we'll be right back with the big enchilada.
[00:48:16.851 --> 00:48:17.311]  Stay with us.
[00:48:19.092 --> 00:48:21.034]  And we shall fight from the firmament.
[00:48:28.078 --> 00:48:32.662]  Aces high, my friends, and we are battling the globalists at point-blank range.
[00:48:34.584 --> 00:48:37.226]  Let me hit the big news as we start the second hour.
[00:48:37.266 --> 00:48:42.871]  I'm going to put it all in this little nine-minute, ten-minute segment, so get ready right now.
[00:48:44.672 --> 00:48:46.674]  I take you first to this exhibit.
[00:48:47.835 --> 00:48:54.140]  Busted CDC inflated COVID numbers accused of violating federal law.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:49:00.521]  And here we've got the article from the great folks at NationalFile.com.
[00:49:00.561 --> 00:49:01.902]  It's linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:02.422 --> 00:49:13.484]  Here's the major science, public health, policy, and law, volume, medical study, respected COVID-19 death collection, comorbidity, federal law, and historical perspective.
[00:49:14.144 --> 00:49:15.965]  It's even what the New York Times had to report last year.
[00:49:18.396 --> 00:49:21.198]  Of the people they say died of COVID actually died of it.
[00:49:21.438 --> 00:49:24.080]  Incredible, big, thick report.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:24.961]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:49:24.981 --> 00:49:29.824]  We're going to be laying all of this out and the latest developments in a moment.
[00:49:29.864 --> 00:49:40.592]  But first, let's give you a historical context of why big corporations would do this and what they have to stand to gain when it comes to total power.
[00:49:41.392 --> 00:49:42.133]  First exhibit.
[00:49:43.834 --> 00:49:45.015]  Theranos founder,
[00:49:46.599 --> 00:49:50.040]  Elizabeth Holmes' fraud trial has a new start date.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:50:03.002]  They just keep kicking it down the road year after year because, you know, this stuff came out five years ago, six years ago, because it ties into the very same big investors like who?
[00:50:03.422 --> 00:50:04.542]  Who was her big sugar daddy?
[00:50:05.062 --> 00:50:06.863]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:50:08.723 --> 00:50:12.784]  They even had documentaries out two years ago with her and Bill Gates in them.
[00:50:12.824 --> 00:50:14.184]  And I mean, they're still big buddies.
[00:50:15.683 --> 00:50:17.183]  This was a beta test, but here's the problem.
[00:50:17.583 --> 00:50:21.784]  Bernie Madoff stole tens of billions of dollars from investors, and his crime was they were rich.
[00:50:22.465 --> 00:50:28.186]  And his crime was he didn't involve a bunch of other big companies, because then they would just lobby Congress to do nothing, and the Justice Department.
[00:50:28.766 --> 00:50:31.227]  Madoff operated as a lone wolf.
[00:50:32.407 --> 00:50:36.248]  Well, Theranos operated as a frontwoman.
[00:50:36.928 --> 00:50:40.389]  Connections to Epstein, connections to Bill Gates, connections to all of them.
[00:50:40.409 --> 00:50:40.849]  What did she do?
[00:50:42.264 --> 00:50:47.377]  She supposedly had a blood testing machine that could tell you if you're gonna get cancer, you're gonna get Alzheimer's.
[00:50:47.437 --> 00:50:49.943]  It's like going to the old-fashioned video game arcades.
[00:50:49.963 --> 00:50:50.424]  They'd have that.
[00:50:51.957 --> 00:50:58.582]  You know, a guy with a turban on, it would, like, ask the great Karnak, and he'd put in a dollar, and you'd ask him a question, the wheel would spin, and he'd tell you.
[00:50:59.003 --> 00:51:03.386]  Basically, that's what it was, but her company raised tens of billions upon billions of dollars.
[00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:04.527]  Total fraud.
[00:51:05.308 --> 00:51:11.653]  And it was the inventor of the PCR test back then that said it was a similar system, and said, you can just set this however you want it, it just makes up whatever you want.
[00:51:11.853 --> 00:51:17.798]  You just put a sample in, sample of a papaya, sample of a goat, sample of blood, it just always says you have COVID.
[00:51:20.635 --> 00:51:21.535]  And then it just sticks out.
[00:51:21.575 --> 00:51:23.796]  You're like, oh, don't question this.
[00:51:24.176 --> 00:51:25.596]  This is a robot.
[00:51:27.196 --> 00:51:30.437]  Bloomberg was pushing it because all he's ever done is sell fraud as well.
[00:51:30.537 --> 00:51:32.297]  Oh, my computers say this is going up.
[00:51:32.377 --> 00:51:33.697]  So everyone goes and buys the stock.
[00:51:33.777 --> 00:51:35.278]  Then he makes, you know, $100 billion.
[00:51:38.218 --> 00:51:41.599]  So when you wonder what COVID-19 is, it brings in global government.
[00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:44.839]  It pays hospitals $3,000 if somebody gets intubated.
[00:51:45.099 --> 00:51:48.040]  So it pays them to say you have COVID, pays them to escalate it.
[00:51:48.982 --> 00:51:51.343]  It pays them to say other things they died of are really COVID.
[00:51:51.363 --> 00:51:52.064]  That's all admitted.
[00:51:52.424 --> 00:51:53.565]  It brings in global government.
[00:51:53.585 --> 00:51:54.465]  It brings in surveillance.
[00:51:54.525 --> 00:51:55.626]  It brings in tracking apps.
[00:51:55.866 --> 00:51:57.327]  It makes you stay in your house when they want.
[00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:59.508]  It makes small businesses go bankrupt.
[00:51:59.548 --> 00:52:05.272]  It doubles the profits of all the big tech companies and Amazon and Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple.
[00:52:06.052 --> 00:52:07.693]  So it's a consolidation of power.
[00:52:07.733 --> 00:52:08.474]  It's a siege.
[00:52:10.094 --> 00:52:20.706]  You know, the old day, Attila the Hun would come into an area or Genghis Khan or the Visigoths, whatever group it was, and they would take over the local community and steal all the cattle and rape and kill, but there'd be a castle.
[00:52:21.406 --> 00:52:25.631]  And they couldn't get into that, so they'd just camp out for a year while everybody starved to death inside the castle.
[00:52:26.412 --> 00:52:27.193]  And then finally gave up.
[00:52:28.474 --> 00:52:29.655]  And so you're just under siege.
[00:52:31.383 --> 00:52:35.326]  COVID is Theranos scam and Elizabeth Holmes 2.0.
[00:52:36.246 --> 00:52:37.867]  And she came right out of the same group of people.
[00:52:38.448 --> 00:52:41.470]  But they went, you know, you can't just do this with one company.
[00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:46.553]  You got to do it big with a partner like Communist China to show us how to operate.
[00:52:47.413 --> 00:52:48.834]  So China says lock people up.
[00:52:48.874 --> 00:52:50.115]  China says do these swabs.
[00:52:50.175 --> 00:52:51.096]  China says do that.
[00:52:51.376 --> 00:52:53.237]  China says never reopen, even though they're reopened.
[00:52:53.477 --> 00:52:55.358]  Now they say stick a swab up your rear end.
[00:52:55.559 --> 00:52:56.259]  Well, we better do it.
[00:52:56.299 --> 00:52:57.360]  I mean, China said so.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.041]  I mean, they're the gold standard.
[00:52:59.061 --> 00:53:00.102]  I mean, they're open for business.
[00:53:00.122 --> 00:53:00.542]  We're not.
[00:53:02.506 --> 00:53:05.708]  Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes' fraud trial has a new start date.
[00:53:06.108 --> 00:53:11.591]  Theranos is reportedly closing after failing to sell itself.
[00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:12.231]  Aww.
[00:53:13.572 --> 00:53:14.292]  Elizabeth Holmes.
[00:53:14.592 --> 00:53:16.353]  You can go read all about it.
[00:53:16.733 --> 00:53:18.934]  How they found that it was all a fraud and none of it was true.
[00:53:19.275 --> 00:53:21.416]  Why they tell people, you've got cancer!
[00:53:22.244 --> 00:53:26.669]  And then they go, we'll do all these tests and surgeries and chop out a lung, brain surgery.
[00:53:26.929 --> 00:53:28.971]  They go, well, Theranos says you've got cancer.
[00:53:28.991 --> 00:53:31.414]  Well, there's a little something there on your front lobe.
[00:53:31.734 --> 00:53:32.675]  Let's cut that off.
[00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:34.177]  You're like, oh, thank you, doctor.
[00:53:34.718 --> 00:53:35.659]  Two days later, you wake up.
[00:53:35.919 --> 00:53:37.260]  I mean, I'm a big meaner.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:37.661]  I mean, liberal!
[00:53:42.938 --> 00:53:47.701]  So, oh, you take this little pill and it goes through you and you crap it out and it tells her everything.
[00:53:47.881 --> 00:53:49.282]  She's a cute blonde!
[00:53:49.522 --> 00:53:52.044]  And she works for George Soros, so it's okay!
[00:53:52.064 --> 00:53:54.546]  It's okay, she's a woman.
[00:53:54.706 --> 00:53:56.347]  It's okay, Tim Cook runs death camps.
[00:53:56.567 --> 00:53:57.928]  He is gay, gay, gay!
[00:53:59.389 --> 00:54:00.169]  It just continues.
[00:54:00.189 --> 00:54:01.210]  They use these front people.
[00:54:02.341 --> 00:54:05.043]  Inside Elizabeth Holmes and the downfall of Theranos.
[00:54:05.303 --> 00:54:06.164]  The downfall?
[00:54:06.584 --> 00:54:12.609]  The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder whose federal fraud trial was delayed until 2021!
[00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:19.134]  Meanwhile, every facet of COVID-19 is a lie.
[00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:23.578]  I mean, you know if you die in a motorcycle accident and you're in a blue city or state, you die of COVID.
[00:54:23.878 --> 00:54:27.101]  You know if you're 89 years old and die of a heart attack, you die of COVID.
[00:54:28.493 --> 00:54:31.436]  Because they can set the little computer however they want.
[00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:32.657]  The nurse knows she gets a bonus.
[00:54:32.937 --> 00:54:35.980]  She comes in, she turns it up 45 times the normal cycle for 100%.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:36.321]  Sticks it in.
[00:54:39.622 --> 00:54:40.943]  We just got 50 plus grand!
[00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:41.743]  Yeah!
[00:54:42.084 --> 00:54:42.484]  Woo!
[00:54:42.764 --> 00:54:44.385]  I mean, you can pay people all day.
[00:54:45.226 --> 00:54:48.608]  I can hire former Green Berets all day to kill people for $20,000.
[00:54:48.788 --> 00:54:49.609]  I'm not about to do it.
[00:54:50.049 --> 00:54:55.633]  But, I mean, you get 50 plus thousand dollars to kill old people or homeless people.
[00:54:55.653 --> 00:54:56.633]  That's why so many are homeless.
[00:54:56.953 --> 00:54:58.394]  Come on in to the nest.
[00:54:58.675 --> 00:55:01.156]  And it's all certain hospitals where they kill everybody.
[00:55:03.017 --> 00:55:05.579]  But it's okay because it's liberal.
[00:55:05.659 --> 00:55:06.280]  Continuing.
[00:55:07.116 --> 00:55:08.078]  So go read those reports.
[00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:09.560]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:55:10.581 --> 00:55:11.342]  Hoo, chief!
[00:55:13.029 --> 00:55:20.990]  There are those who ran his own war crimes in Northern Africa and mass-exterminated people and did medical crimes and covered up a million dead in cholera and wouldn't give them medical aid.
[00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:23.271]  That's why he's a Marxist-Leninist, China backs him.
[00:55:23.651 --> 00:55:29.892]  Well, he's now anointed Mike Bloomberg as global ambassador overseeing COVID-19 with Bill Gates.
[00:55:30.572 --> 00:55:31.412]  And wait, it gets better.
[00:55:31.432 --> 00:55:38.353]  The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he's the head of the G8 this year, 2021, and that Bill Gates will be the shadow leader of the G8.
[00:55:39.073 --> 00:55:42.334]  All these billionaires always wanted to be a global leader, and now they are.
[00:55:43.615 --> 00:55:46.136]  And he comes on TV and tells you when the lockdown ends.
[00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:47.656]  Because he's Bill Gates.
[00:55:49.437 --> 00:55:52.657]  CDC tells Americans to avoid cheering at the Super Bowl.
[00:55:52.937 --> 00:55:55.678]  And remember, wear a mask when you masturbate.
[00:55:56.378 --> 00:55:57.139]  Makes no sense.
[00:55:57.399 --> 00:55:58.399]  Isn't about making sense.
[00:55:58.639 --> 00:56:00.599]  It's about you groveling to them.
[00:56:00.619 --> 00:56:06.281]  United Airlines CEO, mandatory vaccine will become what most companies do.
[00:56:06.341 --> 00:56:08.341]  And the Texas company says no vaccine, no job.
[00:56:08.722 --> 00:56:09.982]  Even though it doesn't protect you.
[00:56:11.812 --> 00:56:16.194]  Even though it can make you sick, even though Merck has pulled back and said the vaccine's dangerous, they're pulling theirs back.
[00:56:16.234 --> 00:56:16.694]  It doesn't matter.
[00:56:16.734 --> 00:56:17.834]  It's too evil to fail.
[00:56:17.854 --> 00:56:19.875]  Because see, Theranos failed because it was one company.
[00:56:20.255 --> 00:56:27.458]  But you get all the big companies involved, all of them in a big scam, and they will commit the mass crime, too evil to fail.
[00:56:27.698 --> 00:56:28.418]  But they have a problem.
[00:56:28.478 --> 00:56:29.719]  France is stopping the vaccine.
[00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:32.420]  Australia is pulling out of it because of false HIV positives.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.741]  Now Merck has pulled out of the vaccine.
[00:56:36.261 --> 00:56:44.344]  All is not happy in this house of straw because the truth is like the big bad wolf and the little piggies are inside screwing us over.
[00:56:44.865 --> 00:56:46.145]  Little piggies are inside raping us.
[00:56:46.325 --> 00:56:51.908]  Here comes along the big bad wolf of truth and he says, let me in.
[00:56:51.948 --> 00:56:53.768]  They say, not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.
[00:56:53.788 --> 00:56:59.611]  So he says, well I'll huff and I'll puff with the truth and I'll blow your house down.
[00:57:00.854 --> 00:57:12.483]  And so Big Tech works around the clock to suppress and stop all the medical doctors and scientists coming out saying it's a hoax, and they try to suppress Congress, and they block congressional hearings, and then major universities and major EU advisory boards say the vaccine's deadly.
[00:57:12.783 --> 00:57:13.524]  What are they gonna do?
[00:57:13.584 --> 00:57:14.625]  They don't know what to do!
[00:57:15.125 --> 00:57:21.050]  Meanwhile, Isle of Man scraps lockdown mask rules, social distancing, return to near normal, says it doesn't work!
[00:57:22.068 --> 00:57:24.631]  Anthony Cooming, a big syndicated talk show host.
[00:57:24.731 --> 00:57:25.812]  I count him as a friend of mine.
[00:57:26.312 --> 00:57:30.596]  He is coming up on the other side to talk about the waterfront and everything else.
[00:57:30.616 --> 00:57:31.357]  Plus, I love where he's at.
[00:57:31.397 --> 00:57:34.660]  Looks like some, like, super fancy WASP facility.
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.583]  Like, I'm in a space station up here on the moon with Elon Musk.
[00:57:38.003 --> 00:57:39.965]  He's, like, hanging out with Judge Smails.
[00:57:40.566 --> 00:57:41.526]  So, we'll be right back.
[00:57:41.547 --> 00:57:42.007]  Stay with us.
[00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.549]  And now...
[00:57:46.098 --> 00:57:51.868]  Anthony Cumia of CompoundMedia.com at TheCumiaShow on Twitter.
[00:57:52.529 --> 00:57:53.610]  Joining us from...
[00:58:01.781 --> 00:58:03.881]  I'm coming to you from Elon Musk Moonbase.
[00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:09.543]  He's coming to you from Judge Smiles' house there at the Maine Caddyshack golf course.
[00:58:10.103 --> 00:58:11.183]  Actually, I love that house.
[00:58:11.203 --> 00:58:11.843]  That's his house.
[00:58:12.403 --> 00:58:14.644]  You know, like the Queen of England's about to walk in any moment.
[00:58:15.204 --> 00:58:15.984]  I like it, actually.
[00:58:16.244 --> 00:58:17.764]  I told my wife, she wanted to remodel the house.
[00:58:17.804 --> 00:58:20.345]  I said, I like green walls and brown wood.
[00:58:20.585 --> 00:58:21.645]  She goes, you don't get that.
[00:58:22.125 --> 00:58:23.465]  So I'm marrying Anthony Comega.
[00:58:23.965 --> 00:58:25.826]  Seriously, that's what I want my house to look like.
[00:58:26.026 --> 00:58:29.867]  Since I like pink walls and stuff, like pink pillows and like white Persian cats.
[00:58:30.107 --> 00:58:30.987]  But anyway, seriously.
[00:58:32.839 --> 00:58:34.440]  Anthony Comey is a great guy.
[00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:39.802]  He had the number one talk show host on Terrestrial Radio that kicked him off, the number one on XM that kicked him off the show.
[00:58:40.063 --> 00:58:41.803]  Now he kicks ass at compoundmedia.com.
[00:58:42.204 --> 00:58:44.725]  And he's in New York, which is crazy.
[00:58:44.785 --> 00:58:46.346]  Great people, but horrible government.
[00:58:46.726 --> 00:58:49.887]  Cuomo's under investigation, covering up more thousands of dead.
[00:58:50.308 --> 00:58:51.868]  So, my friend, good to see you again.
[00:58:51.908 --> 00:58:52.709]  I'm glad you're on with us.
[00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:54.731]  Oh my god, Alex.
[00:58:54.791 --> 00:58:55.712]  Great to see you.
[00:58:55.772 --> 00:58:58.095]  I've been keeping tabs on everything you've been doing.
[00:58:58.155 --> 00:58:59.877]  Tearing it up, as usual.
[00:59:00.317 --> 00:59:00.938]  I love it.
[00:59:01.679 --> 00:59:05.603]  Yeah, I'm here in the United Soviet Socialist Republic of New York.
[00:59:07.142 --> 00:59:10.105]  Just an abomination now.
[00:59:10.185 --> 00:59:11.106]  You thought it was bad.
[00:59:11.146 --> 00:59:12.728]  Everyone thought it was bad for a while.
[00:59:13.289 --> 00:59:14.250]  It is so bad.
[00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:18.834]  I'm leaving this beautiful house and this wonderful office that I have.
[00:59:18.914 --> 00:59:20.336]  I will be leaving behind.
[00:59:20.796 --> 00:59:22.018]  I can't take it anymore.
[00:59:22.098 --> 00:59:23.860]  I'm putting my money where my mouth is.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.842]  My house is up for sale.
[00:59:26.002 --> 00:59:28.544]  I am getting the hell out of this state.
[00:59:28.845 --> 00:59:29.786]  I'm finally doing it.
[00:59:30.353 --> 00:59:37.058]  Well, I don't normally get into how houses look, but that's actually what I like, and I've never been able to actually convince my ex-wife or my current wife that houses look like that.
[00:59:37.318 --> 00:59:38.939]  What do you call that, like English gentleman?
[00:59:38.959 --> 00:59:39.640]  That looks badass.
[00:59:40.533 --> 00:59:40.813]  Yeah.
[00:59:40.853 --> 00:59:41.013]  Yeah.
[00:59:41.113 --> 00:59:49.539]  It really I just wanted it to look like offices I had seen on the shows I grew up with, you know, Perry Mason and all that stuff.
[00:59:49.579 --> 00:59:55.182]  So I want I wanted it to be the dark wood and the green walls and whatnot.
[00:59:55.723 --> 00:59:57.464]  And yeah, I like it.
[00:59:57.564 --> 00:59:59.945]  It's much it's out of my pay grade.
[01:00:00.025 --> 01:00:03.327]  Like it looks a lot better than, you know, I'm sitting here with my my
[01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:05.450]  I think so.
[01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:31.953]  I guess the biggest city in the world, the most lucrative city.
[01:00:32.374 --> 01:00:36.476]  Giuliani had made New York as much of a paradise as it could be.
[01:00:37.277 --> 01:00:39.178]  Tourists were coming here, everything.
[01:00:39.558 --> 01:00:44.441]  And then now we have Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo.
[01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:52.106]  They have shut down New York City to the point where there is not one productive person walking the street.
[01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:55.608]  This is like something out of a zombie movie.
[01:00:56.068 --> 01:01:03.575]  It's addicts and homeless and criminals roaming the streets every day.
[01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:06.718]  There's an increase in violent crime.
[01:01:06.738 --> 01:01:09.841]  And the restaurants are all shut down.
[01:01:10.261 --> 01:01:18.289]  So these businesses, we just had a blizzard here a couple of days ago, and they're saying, well, you've got to eat outside, eat outside.
[01:01:18.469 --> 01:01:20.511]  No one is dining outside.
[01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:21.651]  In New York City.
[01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:26.453]  I don't know how these restaurants after just about a year are still open.
[01:01:27.113 --> 01:01:28.654]  A lot of them have closed down.
[01:01:29.514 --> 01:01:32.235]  I've tried to frequent some of them as much as I can.
[01:01:32.536 --> 01:01:35.917]  Some of the local ones around my studio and the truth of the matter is
[01:01:36.537 --> 01:01:37.678]  You just can't do it.
[01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:42.002]  They've made it impossible to support these local businesses.
[01:01:42.022 --> 01:01:43.963]  And I saw you talking about this a few weeks ago in a clip.
[01:01:43.983 --> 01:01:45.044]  That's why I actually thought I'd get you on.
[01:01:45.064 --> 01:01:51.749]  You were talking about that local restaurant dared to open so they like broke in, arrested the guy, beat him up.
[01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:52.590]  I mean this is crazy.
[01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.685]  It's unbelievable what they're doing.
[01:01:55.705 --> 01:01:59.028]  This went from, you know, 15 days to flatten the curve.
[01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:08.879]  And, you know, we recommend you wear a mask to these laws that are being enforced that aren't laws by people that
[01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:11.760]  We have no business enforcing any laws.
[01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:14.302]  Agencies appointed people.
[01:02:14.742 --> 01:02:17.724]  No one voted on these laws.
[01:02:17.784 --> 01:02:19.344]  They don't represent the people.
[01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:29.970]  Yet they just put us under these draconian regulations where you're not allowed to leave your house and go to work.
[01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.973]  This is such a basic thing for Americans.
[01:02:34.213 --> 01:02:37.876]  This is so basic as far as the American dream goes.
[01:02:38.457 --> 01:02:44.942]  You get yourself a job, you start a small business, you cultivate it and make something of it.
[01:02:45.202 --> 01:02:47.024]  They have put a stop to it.
[01:02:47.384 --> 01:02:51.147]  And not a stop where they recommend, like I said, recommend you do this or that.
[01:02:51.468 --> 01:02:52.929]  They are enforcing these things.
[01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:54.591]  You can't open your business.
[01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:55.912]  You can't earn a living.
[01:02:56.153 --> 01:02:57.855]  You can't send your kid to school.
[01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:01.019]  You can't leave your house and congregate or go to dinner.
[01:03:01.339 --> 01:03:06.966]  These are all such basic things that most Americans have seemed to just throw away.
[01:03:06.986 --> 01:03:07.787]  Let me ask you this.
[01:03:07.927 --> 01:03:08.427]  Okay!
[01:03:09.188 --> 01:03:10.548]  What do you think the motive is?
[01:03:10.629 --> 01:03:13.309]  Because, I mean, I know so many people that are New Yorkers.
[01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.689]  Great people.
[01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:15.290]  Like, when I was a kid, I went to New York.
[01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:15.930]  It was a great city.
[01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:16.870]  It was kind of scary.
[01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:19.211]  When Giuliani ran it, it was like the best city ever.
[01:03:19.251 --> 01:03:20.511]  I loved the energy, the food.
[01:03:21.191 --> 01:03:21.932]  Everything was fun.
[01:03:21.952 --> 01:03:22.452]  Everything was great.
[01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:25.733]  And then you watch it rot the last few years in garbage and rats.
[01:03:25.753 --> 01:03:29.394]  The last time I was there, I was like, God, this place has gone down even like five years ago.
[01:03:29.414 --> 01:03:30.194]  Then I was there a year ago.
[01:03:30.214 --> 01:03:31.534]  I was like, man, this place is in trouble.
[01:03:31.854 --> 01:03:33.415]  And now I'm told it's even more hellish.
[01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:35.870]  It is crazy now.
[01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:41.253]  Here's what I think the issue is and what they're trying to do.
[01:03:41.674 --> 01:03:46.717]  Democrats, liberals, what have you, they love you to need them.
[01:03:47.806 --> 01:03:48.847]  You have to need them.
[01:03:48.987 --> 01:03:51.968]  They can't stand when you're standing on your own two feet.
[01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:53.428]  You run your own business.
[01:03:53.649 --> 01:03:54.809]  You're self-sufficient.
[01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:57.870]  You have your family and they're doing fine.
[01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:03.813]  They hate that because they need to be in your crap every day.
[01:04:03.893 --> 01:04:04.293]  They need
[01:04:05.774 --> 01:04:11.579]  To dangle $600 in front of your face so that you're begging for it.
[01:04:11.999 --> 01:04:18.764]  And people that work for a living and have made something of themselves, they don't do that.
[01:04:19.185 --> 01:04:20.986]  Now, they've shut it down.
[01:04:21.326 --> 01:04:22.487]  They're getting more people.
[01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:28.912]  Do you see how the American public are reacting to them dangling money in front of their face?
[01:04:29.193 --> 01:04:29.673]  Oh, where's the $1,400?
[01:04:29.833 --> 01:04:31.514]  Oh, they're begging like train seals!
[01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:32.275]  Are we getting the $1,400?
[01:04:33.796 --> 01:04:34.997]  They're begging like train seals.
[01:04:36.677 --> 01:04:38.958]  Yes, like train seals.
[01:04:39.258 --> 01:04:41.559]  That's what they've made us do.
[01:04:41.979 --> 01:04:44.400]  They've made people beg for $1,400.
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.401]  It's been a year of this crap.
[01:04:47.741 --> 01:04:50.622]  And they, after a while, gave us $6,000.
[01:04:51.002 --> 01:04:54.283]  And now $1,400, which they still haven't given.
[01:04:54.343 --> 01:05:02.066]  They're arguing about that with this blithering idiot in the White House now and all his appointees that look like a freak show from the circus.
[01:05:03.307 --> 01:05:04.248]  It's bedlam.
[01:05:05.048 --> 01:05:07.910]  And they need you to say, please help us.
[01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:09.552]  My children are hungry.
[01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:10.953]  We can't pay the rent.
[01:05:10.993 --> 01:05:11.493]  We can't do it.
[01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.295]  And they figured out how to do it.
[01:05:13.595 --> 01:05:14.436]  It's astounding.
[01:05:14.676 --> 01:05:15.797]  They figured out how to do it.
[01:05:15.937 --> 01:05:17.938]  I had a lot more faith in the American people.
[01:05:18.299 --> 01:05:20.761]  I thought they would rebel a lot sooner.
[01:05:20.881 --> 01:05:26.045]  I thought they would never put up with what they put on us for a year now.
[01:05:26.425 --> 01:05:28.887]  But we just seem to go with it.
[01:05:29.308 --> 01:05:30.789]  It's very disappointing.
[01:05:31.257 --> 01:05:34.963]  Well, we're gonna come back in a longer segment and talk about that, but they hit us like you said, though.
[01:05:35.717 --> 01:05:39.459]  I mean, if the Japanese or the Russians or whoever attacked us, we'd kick their ass.
[01:05:39.759 --> 01:05:42.540]  The thing is, it's like, oh, just be nice and be a hero for 15 days.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.460]  And it's all too much.
[01:05:43.501 --> 01:05:48.623]  And then six months and, oh, well, and see, they just kind of, it's that, it's cult programming.
[01:05:48.803 --> 01:05:55.126]  They have used cult programming to manipulate our good side, to get us under peer pressure to think, okay, I'll give something up.
[01:05:55.206 --> 01:05:59.087]  So because we believe we're giving it up for a greater good, now we're willing to do more and more.
[01:05:59.127 --> 01:06:03.369]  But all these Democrats caught out partying and not wearing masks, that's their Achilles heel.
[01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:15.039]  How we get out of this with Anthony Comey of Compound Media on the other side and get into a bunch of other issues as well and the military in DC and Joe Biden and the inoculations not working and so much more.
[01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:18.001]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[01:06:18.382 --> 01:06:20.083]  They hope you don't share that URL.
[01:06:20.123 --> 01:06:22.965]  We'll be right back and compoundmedia.com.
[01:06:22.985 --> 01:06:23.326]  Stay with us.
[01:06:25.296 --> 01:06:25.936]  I am name dropping.
[01:06:25.956 --> 01:06:27.217]  I was just talking to Joe Rogan during the break.
[01:06:27.737 --> 01:06:29.817]  A lot of crazy stuff going on, man.
[01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:30.317]  Wow.
[01:06:31.218 --> 01:06:39.300]  And Anthony Comea, another great comedian, that's what this comes down to is, all the crazy stuff I talked about, you talked about, it's all been proven now.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.000]  It's out in the open.
[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:46.161]  So as bad as all this is, and I get you're pissed at your fellow Americans, so am I, they were inducted into it incrementally.
[01:06:46.201 --> 01:06:47.382]  Successive approximation.
[01:06:48.002 --> 01:06:48.482]  But wow.
[01:06:49.972 --> 01:06:50.933]  Isn't this an adventure?
[01:06:51.013 --> 01:07:01.758]  It sucks to leave your office, it sucks to leave New York, it sucks to see it happening, but it's still an incredible adventure, and what's going to happen to all the people that went along with this crazy directives of Bill Gates?
[01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:04.079]  I mean, who died and made this guy king of the world?
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:10.983]  It's amazing the way these heads of these corporations have become
[01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:12.531]  The government.
[01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:20.556]  They are much more important to our day-to-day lives than the government is.
[01:07:20.976 --> 01:07:23.978]  They're the ones running our lives.
[01:07:24.038 --> 01:07:25.479]  They're in it every day.
[01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:28.021]  We order things online.
[01:07:28.761 --> 01:07:33.465]  They've made it so our food has to be dropped off at our front door by these companies.
[01:07:35.526 --> 01:07:37.567]  We're a lot less self-sufficient.
[01:07:37.587 --> 01:07:41.089]  And it's like I said earlier, they need us to need them.
[01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:50.255]  So when you got people like Bill Gates and companies like Amazon, these are your new overlords.
[01:07:50.395 --> 01:07:55.738]  They're the ones that tell you what you can and can't say and who you can and can't say it to.
[01:07:56.119 --> 01:08:01.222]  You know, Alex, you've been thrown off of more social media probably than I have.
[01:08:01.782 --> 01:08:10.872]  And a lot of the people that are saying, speaking the truth, have their eyes wide open, are the ones getting thrown off of places like Twitter.
[01:08:11.112 --> 01:08:14.575]  And then they go, oh, make your own social media platform.
[01:08:14.776 --> 01:08:18.299]  Well, someone tried with Parler and you saw what happened there.
[01:08:18.519 --> 01:08:19.921]  They shut that down.
[01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:22.604]  It's so blatantly obvious.
[01:08:23.364 --> 01:08:30.650]  I don't know who isn't seeing this for what it is and why they just capitulate to it and what I think is going to happen to them.
[01:08:31.071 --> 01:08:33.353]  Eventually, their eyes will open.
[01:08:33.593 --> 01:08:40.699]  They're going to look around and go, what the hell have we let happen to this great former great country of ours?
[01:08:40.999 --> 01:08:51.748]  I'm very pessimistic, Alex, because I've I've seen the way as long as we have the bare minimum of creature comforts, we're willing to give up rights that
[01:08:52.595 --> 01:09:04.930]  People have fought and died for that we've had for a couple of centuries and they're just willing to give them all away just as long as maybe I have a tattered blanket and a cracker.
[01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:08.895]  Well Anthony, let's talk about that because I'm not trying to say you're wonderful or I'm wonderful but
[01:09:09.255 --> 01:09:10.656]  My dad cared about freedom, still does.
[01:09:10.696 --> 01:09:11.977]  I'm sure it must have been instilled by you.
[01:09:12.397 --> 01:09:13.498]  That's an American value.
[01:09:13.718 --> 01:09:16.039]  People came here because they were fleeing oppression.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.161]  People used to say, hey, you better value this country.
[01:09:18.181 --> 01:09:18.981]  You better fight for this.
[01:09:19.402 --> 01:09:21.063]  And now overnight, it's just all gone.
[01:09:21.103 --> 01:09:22.283]  And then the prosperity goes.
[01:09:23.124 --> 01:09:27.887]  What are these people going to do when they realize that all the prosperity is gone because they didn't stand up for freedom?
[01:09:27.947 --> 01:09:30.789]  I mean, you've got to territorially defend your basic rights.
[01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:35.911]  That is a great question, Alex, with no answer.
[01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:36.511]  I don't know.
[01:09:37.271 --> 01:09:40.352]  There seems to be a lot of genuine patriots in this country.
[01:09:41.193 --> 01:09:46.934]  Obviously, at least 70, 80 million of them voted for Donald Trump.
[01:09:47.754 --> 01:09:51.996]  That whole movement of being proud of your nation.
[01:09:52.836 --> 01:09:54.516]  But they're cut off by big corporations.
[01:09:54.596 --> 01:09:56.677]  It's big media, big tech, big corporations.
[01:09:57.097 --> 01:09:58.998]  They own everything so they can gaslight us.
[01:09:59.238 --> 01:10:00.238]  So how do we break through that?
[01:10:01.482 --> 01:10:08.852]  Boy, you know, I've said it on my show quite a few times and people have gotten pretty nervous.
[01:10:09.092 --> 01:10:17.163]  We're getting very close to the point where talking and being civil just won't work anymore.
[01:10:17.883 --> 01:10:19.684]  You could speculate what that means.
[01:10:20.385 --> 01:10:26.128]  They are trying to infringe on a lot of our rights, and one of those being the Second Amendment.
[01:10:27.249 --> 01:10:29.951]  And I think we know what their reasoning is.
[01:10:30.371 --> 01:10:31.892]  They don't want to be in the crosshairs.
[01:10:31.952 --> 01:10:45.681]  If you look back at history, you'll see a lot of these crooked politicians and traitors and treasonous people were treated with the utmost violence.
[01:10:46.782 --> 01:10:47.742]  Let's expand on that.
[01:10:47.802 --> 01:10:48.843]  You have H.R.
[01:10:49.084 --> 01:10:57.350]  127 that gets rid of due process, plus the Justice Department without law decide who can own a gun, decide what psychological parameters or tests you must take to get a gun.
[01:10:57.451 --> 01:11:03.456]  Arbitrarily, this is making the head of the Justice Department a dictator over our guns, over our mental health.
[01:11:03.516 --> 01:11:08.200]  And they call the Capitol riot, which was a few hundred idiots out of hundreds of thousands of peaceful people,
[01:11:09.081 --> 01:11:11.866]  Getting shot and killed for breaking and stealing a few things.
[01:11:11.906 --> 01:11:13.750]  The majority walked through the velvet robes.
[01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:18.519]  Now they've got permanent troops there, they're saying, because they're calling it the new Pearl Harbor.
[01:11:18.539 --> 01:11:19.481]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:11:20.853 --> 01:11:27.356]  The media is the most despicable thing about this country right now.
[01:11:27.636 --> 01:11:30.557]  We at least knew the politicians were pieces of garbage.
[01:11:30.978 --> 01:11:49.626]  We knew the media was biased in the past, but what they've done the past four years or so, while President Trump was in office, and what they're doing now, is pure Soviet-era, task news agency communism, censorship,
[01:11:50.447 --> 01:11:54.011]  Uh, just plain, outright lying for the state.
[01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:55.412]  That's what they're doing.
[01:11:55.793 --> 01:11:59.777]  And again, this should be obvious to everybody, but there are people so brainwashed.
[01:12:00.318 --> 01:12:03.321]  Uh, the, I love the, we're not taking your guns away.
[01:12:03.381 --> 01:12:04.903]  Don't worry, we're not taking your guns.
[01:12:05.163 --> 01:12:08.847]  And then I read about these, uh, rules that, uh, you know, what's her name?
[01:12:08.887 --> 01:12:11.190]  Jackson Lee there is trying to, uh,
[01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:14.975]  Uh, an act, a bill that has, yeah, red flags.
[01:12:15.256 --> 01:12:17.720]  You have to take a mental evaluation.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.222]  Well, that sounds vague.
[01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:25.331]  That sounds pretty arbitrary that they could take anyone's guns at any time for an accusation.
[01:12:27.605 --> 01:12:29.165]  I'll show you right here.
[01:12:29.425 --> 01:12:32.946]  Every room in my smells house has a weapon in it.
[01:12:34.106 --> 01:12:36.567]  I keep them nearby because I don't know.
[01:12:36.587 --> 01:12:40.007]  Hey, I like how the shotgun shells are green and match that badass decor.
[01:12:40.367 --> 01:12:41.868]  That is a nice shotgun.
[01:12:42.228 --> 01:12:42.948]  What is that beauty?
[01:12:43.768 --> 01:12:44.928]  This is a Remington.
[01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.609]  Your standard pump-action shotgun.
[01:12:49.249 --> 01:12:50.689]  Very good for home defense.
[01:12:51.089 --> 01:12:51.929]  Has the little light on it.
[01:12:51.949 --> 01:12:56.250]  By the way, you know the Democrats, the same ones suing me, successfully sued them into bankruptcy last year.
[01:12:57.125 --> 01:12:57.846]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:12:58.226 --> 01:12:58.566]  I know.
[01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:00.387]  Well, that's what they do.
[01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:03.389]  Again, they use litigation.
[01:13:03.769 --> 01:13:09.193]  They use big corporations and cronies to take your guns away.
[01:13:10.133 --> 01:13:16.578]  No one's going to come and say, well, we have to rewrite the Second Amendment to say that no one is allowed to have guns.
[01:13:16.598 --> 01:13:17.378]  We'll repeal it.
[01:13:17.778 --> 01:13:19.039]  It doesn't happen that way.
[01:13:19.319 --> 01:13:23.162]  Look how everything is presented to you when they're taking away a right.
[01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:24.943]  It's a protection act.
[01:13:25.303 --> 01:13:26.924]  It's something that's going to help you.
[01:13:27.285 --> 01:13:28.706]  Oh, we care about this.
[01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:33.149]  And everything that they care about and want to help you with takes away one of your rights.
[01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:35.832]  Did you see the video last Saturday on Reliable Sources?
[01:13:35.852 --> 01:13:36.712]  There's like 100,000 viewers.
[01:13:36.752 --> 01:13:37.333]  Total joke.
[01:13:37.353 --> 01:13:38.514]  Tucker Carlson has 5 million.
[01:13:39.274 --> 01:13:40.415]  He said, we're not censoring.
[01:13:40.435 --> 01:13:42.677]  We just want to take Tucker off the air to protect him.
[01:13:42.697 --> 01:13:43.398]  These are quotes.
[01:13:44.178 --> 01:13:45.960]  And we're not going to censor you.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:49.102]  We're just getting rid of your reach so you can't be on cable or TV.
[01:13:49.162 --> 01:13:52.405]  I mean, the level of gaslighting is like Monty Python.
[01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:57.493]  It really is so blatantly obvious and such parody these days.
[01:13:57.533 --> 01:14:02.897]  You read things like The Onion and Babylon B and you don't know if it's actual news or not anymore.
[01:14:03.278 --> 01:14:05.319]  It's so ludicrous.
[01:14:05.379 --> 01:14:06.360]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:10.723]  But yeah, same thing with the Wall Street thing that's going on.
[01:14:11.003 --> 01:14:20.491]  You had Robinhood, this company that gets people that aren't too sophisticated in stock trading to buy in.
[01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:26.155]  And then they tell people they're selling off their stocks to protect them.
[01:14:26.356 --> 01:14:29.138]  Again, we're doing it to help you and protect you.
[01:14:30.219 --> 01:14:30.619]  Why?
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.621]  I can make my own decisions.
[01:14:32.721 --> 01:14:33.522]  I'm a big boy.
[01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:36.964]  I signed the terms of service.
[01:14:37.225 --> 01:14:38.326]  But that's what they do.
[01:14:38.366 --> 01:14:40.067]  They say they're helping Alex.
[01:14:40.087 --> 01:14:41.448]  They're protecting you.
[01:14:41.808 --> 01:14:44.671]  And then they strip you of just some more of your rights.
[01:14:44.691 --> 01:14:45.812]  By the way, I'm sure you saw that.
[01:14:46.172 --> 01:14:48.693]  But now they actually have the CNBC headlines.
[01:14:49.233 --> 01:14:52.494]  The hedge funds are good, the little guys are bad.
[01:14:52.514 --> 01:14:53.954]  I mean, it's all just inverted.
[01:14:54.674 --> 01:14:58.055]  Like, they're trying to short 140-something percent of an American company.
[01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:03.257]  They're trying to totally destroy it, and people prop it up, and then they actually whine and bitch.
[01:15:04.693 --> 01:15:08.075]  Yeah, it's amazing how they twist things around.
[01:15:08.255 --> 01:15:15.940]  I don't think I've used the word Orwellian more in my life than I have over the past recent history.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.161]  It is right out of 1984.
[01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:21.123]  When I was a kid and I had to read 1984 in school,
[01:15:24.425 --> 01:15:26.587]  You went, wow, this is so odd.
[01:15:26.607 --> 01:15:27.847]  You always thought it was Russia.
[01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:29.128]  Like, Russia was this.
[01:15:29.909 --> 01:15:33.311]  And you read it and went, that could never happen here.
[01:15:33.531 --> 01:15:34.311]  We're Americans.
[01:15:34.351 --> 01:15:35.392]  We love our freedom.
[01:15:35.472 --> 01:15:38.674]  And then you just see it right in front of your face.
[01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:39.775]  You see it happening.
[01:15:40.655 --> 01:15:42.737]  And you call out quotes in the book.
[01:15:43.177 --> 01:15:43.857]  Newspeak.
[01:15:43.917 --> 01:15:44.698]  Things like that.
[01:15:44.918 --> 01:15:49.282]  Hold on, are you saying you're against the new czar that Biden set to announce this week?
[01:15:49.322 --> 01:15:50.303]  The reality czar?
[01:15:50.664 --> 01:15:51.585]  Not satire, folks.
[01:15:51.605 --> 01:15:53.547]  We'll be back with Anthony Cumia, Compound Media.
[01:15:53.767 --> 01:15:57.250]  They are now going to have a reality czar that tells you what reality is.
[01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.771]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:59.397 --> 01:16:01.599]  Well, Anthony Cumia is our guest for one more segment.
[01:16:01.619 --> 01:16:02.780]  Really appreciate him coming on.
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.900]  He's a busy man.
[01:16:04.361 --> 01:16:06.122]  Compoundmedia.com at Twitter.
[01:16:06.622 --> 01:16:07.463]  The Cumia Show.
[01:16:07.483 --> 01:16:08.884]  And he's got a great show.
[01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:14.288]  I watch a lot of people online, but I watch him probably almost every other day when I'm on a treadmill.
[01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:16.109]  I go, I'm going to watch some Cumia because he's got energy.
[01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.950]  He's into it.
[01:16:17.250 --> 01:16:18.952]  People ask me, Jones, how do you have so much energy?
[01:16:18.972 --> 01:16:19.852]  Are you on cocaine?
[01:16:20.192 --> 01:16:21.173]  Are you on speed?
[01:16:21.193 --> 01:16:22.334]  And the answer is a no.
[01:16:22.354 --> 01:16:25.597]  I actually drink too much because I've got to suppress this, okay?
[01:16:26.397 --> 01:16:29.158]  Being raped of my freedom pisses me off.
[01:16:29.238 --> 01:16:30.819]  It makes me want to beat people's asses.
[01:16:31.319 --> 01:16:33.340]  So getting on air is therapeutic for me.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.460]  Speaking of that, I asked you to be in the break.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.801]  You don't mind telling folks where you're moving.
[01:16:36.841 --> 01:16:37.821]  You're leaving New York.
[01:16:37.881 --> 01:16:38.381]  Talk about it.
[01:16:38.641 --> 01:16:39.382]  Where are you going?
[01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:45.644]  Because as much as I like Texas, all the Californians are coming here driving up prices, where if I can't pay for it, the average guy must be in trouble.
[01:16:46.710 --> 01:16:47.811]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:47.911 --> 01:16:49.672]  I'm going to South Carolina.
[01:16:50.753 --> 01:16:52.374]  My sister already moved down there.
[01:16:52.394 --> 01:16:56.678]  A few other members of my family are seriously thinking about it.
[01:16:57.098 --> 01:17:03.783]  I can't stand paying the amount of taxes I pay in the state of New York to just get screwed.
[01:17:04.124 --> 01:17:06.826]  To just get screwed at every turn.
[01:17:07.146 --> 01:17:09.408]  They are in your pockets.
[01:17:09.828 --> 01:17:10.849]  They're up your
[01:17:11.429 --> 01:17:23.252]  Keister, every single day there's something that Cuomo and de Blasio and all these other politicians in New York, and they're going to be hurting, Alex.
[01:17:24.152 --> 01:17:25.732]  I don't know where they're going to get their revenue from.
[01:17:26.172 --> 01:17:31.773]  All the people that are contributing to New York State, and especially New York City, are leaving.
[01:17:32.094 --> 01:17:34.134]  And I understand some of the people in these other states are going to be mad.
[01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:37.615]  Well, we know that they think Biden's going to unjustly give them like double the bailout the other states.
[01:17:37.655 --> 01:17:38.335]  I think that's the plan.
[01:17:39.434 --> 01:17:48.959]  Well, that was what they were worried about with Trump, because Trump was telling them, screw you, I'm not giving you money to make up and pay for the mistakes you've made over the course of the years.
[01:17:50.059 --> 01:17:56.943]  But now, of course, Biden, oh, he's just going to deal it out and Cuomo will be fine in New York.
[01:17:56.963 --> 01:18:04.406]  He'll be able to have all his little pet projects and sign his midnight legislation to rip your rights away like he's done since he's been in office.
[01:18:04.866 --> 01:18:08.108]  The whole family, him, the one on CNN, his father,
[01:18:08.568 --> 01:18:12.991]  All pieces of garbage that have just destroyed New York.
[01:18:14.191 --> 01:18:24.317]  I won't play the video, but, and I interrupt you at the other point, I'm going to make it, make it, I want to hear it, but, remember when he made the comment, so what if, you know, 4,000 people died, now it's 12,000 plus, he covered it up.
[01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:26.018]  Why is he so freaking arrogant?
[01:18:26.038 --> 01:18:27.799]  Like, I'm a tough guy, man, I'm on a wimp.
[01:18:28.359 --> 01:18:32.182]  And if I killed 12,000 innocent people, I'd be apologizing, saying it was a mistake.
[01:18:32.462 --> 01:18:34.063]  I sure as hell wouldn't be saying, so what?
[01:18:34.083 --> 01:18:36.104]  Because I'd be afraid somebody's going to come kill my ass.
[01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:41.507]  He wrote a book about how great he handled the COVID thing.
[01:18:41.527 --> 01:18:42.007]  Oh yeah.
[01:18:42.127 --> 01:18:44.188]  In the middle of it, like before it was over.
[01:18:44.228 --> 01:18:45.149]  It's not over now.
[01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:46.689]  It's still in full effect.
[01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:50.211]  And he wrote a book, how great a job he did.
[01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:56.654]  One of my favorite things we talked about on the show early on in this COVID nonsense, he was talking about masks.
[01:18:56.734 --> 01:18:57.814]  People needed masks.
[01:18:58.154 --> 01:18:59.415]  The first responders, everybody.
[01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:04.837]  And then I guess people, civilians sent him homemade masks to give out to these people.
[01:19:05.077 --> 01:19:06.458]  He made a mural of them.
[01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:07.839]  And show them.
[01:19:07.919 --> 01:19:12.585]  It's like, no dummy, this was supposed to be so people could wear masks if they want to.
[01:19:12.886 --> 01:19:14.548]  You know, when we still thought that was a thing.
[01:19:14.568 --> 01:19:17.051]  And remember the weird mural he made where he's the hero?
[01:19:17.071 --> 01:19:17.131]  Yes!
[01:19:20.251 --> 01:19:21.851]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:19:22.011 --> 01:19:23.592]  This guy is terrible.
[01:19:23.832 --> 01:19:25.912]  And de Blasio in New York is even worse.
[01:19:26.092 --> 01:19:28.873]  This guy's a full-fledged communist.
[01:19:29.653 --> 01:19:35.674]  And he wants nothing to do with Americans being able to take care of themselves and be self-sufficient.
[01:19:36.314 --> 01:19:37.255]  He wants to be king.
[01:19:37.295 --> 01:19:39.635]  His wife lost billions of dollars.
[01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:40.895]  No one questions it.
[01:19:41.275 --> 01:19:42.336]  No one's able to question it.
[01:19:42.376 --> 01:19:46.956]  She was in charge of one of these programs, and the money just disappeared.
[01:19:47.497 --> 01:19:49.317]  No one is able to account for it.
[01:19:49.617 --> 01:19:51.398]  And that's the city we live in.
[01:19:51.438 --> 01:19:52.878]  Sounds like Bernie Sanders.
[01:19:53.058 --> 01:19:54.299]  Sounds like what Bernie Sanders does.
[01:19:54.899 --> 01:19:55.439]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:56.039 --> 01:19:56.599]  Exactly.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.440]  And that's why I'm getting out of here.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.101]  And some of these states, they're getting a little angry.
[01:20:01.141 --> 01:20:03.322]  They're like, hey, don't bring your garbage down here.
[01:20:03.682 --> 01:20:07.203]  By the way, nothing against dudes that want to have nipple rings, but that's really creepy on him.
[01:20:08.287 --> 01:20:09.048]  I really is.
[01:20:10.008 --> 01:20:12.570]  He's probably a total degenerate.
[01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:14.871]  He's probably a complete degenerate.
[01:20:15.531 --> 01:20:22.515]  Because every time people talk to him, he is arrogant, nasty, and it seems like he's hiding something.
[01:20:22.715 --> 01:20:23.816]  That's what I think, anyway.
[01:20:24.116 --> 01:20:26.519]  Well, we got about five minutes left and I'm blown away here.
[01:20:26.619 --> 01:20:28.001]  Everything you're saying is totally on target.
[01:20:28.101 --> 01:20:31.045]  Gut level, as a smart guy, what do you see happening?
[01:20:31.065 --> 01:20:32.126]  Because obviously Trump won.
[01:20:32.146 --> 01:20:33.848]  It's going to create a huge nostalgia.
[01:20:34.148 --> 01:20:37.432]  Democrats even admit his movement is stronger than ever, the populism.
[01:20:37.873 --> 01:20:41.297]  I mean, and now this trial is all going to fall apart in the Senate.
[01:20:41.317 --> 01:20:42.198]  I mean, this is a circus.
[01:20:43.286 --> 01:20:46.929]  It is a circus and enough people have to open their eyes.
[01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:55.897]  I've seen it happen where people, I don't think you're going to get those hardcore lefties that watch CNN and actually believe it.
[01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:59.680]  But there are a lot of people that, you know, we're in it, Alex.
[01:20:59.841 --> 01:21:01.262]  Every day we're fighting.
[01:21:01.702 --> 01:21:06.748]  And we're on our shows telling people we have to keep informed.
[01:21:06.988 --> 01:21:10.092]  The majority of Americans really are pretty apathetic.
[01:21:10.993 --> 01:21:17.681]  But when they start seeing their freedoms taken away and their livelihoods taken away, they will wake up.
[01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:20.244]  We have a greatly divided nation.
[01:21:20.364 --> 01:21:22.006]  I think it will further divide.
[01:21:22.666 --> 01:21:26.070]  And one side or the other has to come out on top of this thing.
[01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:26.911]  I don't know how.
[01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:28.653]  I don't know how it transpires.
[01:21:28.813 --> 01:21:32.357]  Is it literally a bloody revolution that takes place?
[01:21:32.817 --> 01:21:37.823]  Or do enough people wake up where they start voting these people out?
[01:21:38.633 --> 01:21:49.318]  Although I don't think the elections mean anything anymore after the last one, and that crock that happened, I absolutely... Well that's the problem, they're trying to codify with H.R.
[01:21:49.338 --> 01:22:05.707]  1 all the fraud, because the states are moving to say, you can't just outside laws, they have these fake mail-in ballots, so the states are asserting the Constitution, so the Democrats want to now say, we're federalizing elections, we're federalizing medicine, we've got a whole stack here, we're federalizing D.C., we are federalizing...
[01:22:06.647 --> 01:22:09.173]  Cory Booker wants to federalize college sports.
[01:22:09.193 --> 01:22:09.734]  Did you see that?
[01:22:09.754 --> 01:22:11.438]  Oh my god.
[01:22:11.738 --> 01:22:12.500]  Of course.
[01:22:12.821 --> 01:22:14.264]  He is a blithering idiot.
[01:22:14.725 --> 01:22:16.408]  That man is a dope.
[01:22:17.674 --> 01:22:27.877]  And how is it that people, there's anybody that doesn't believe that shenanigans were happening when no way Trump was losing before COVID.
[01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:30.898]  The economy booming, everyone's doing well.
[01:22:30.918 --> 01:22:39.361]  But wait a minute, you mean like if I black the windows out and kick everybody out and say a water main broke, then I pull suitcases out and start running the same ballots over and over again, nothing's going on?
[01:22:40.293 --> 01:22:42.835]  Oh, it's been proven that that didn't happen.
[01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:43.835]  It's been debunked.
[01:22:44.215 --> 01:22:44.896]  Who told you that?
[01:22:45.216 --> 01:22:49.078]  Oh, the news that lies and is in bed with the left and the Democrats.
[01:22:50.279 --> 01:22:51.220]  No, but you're right.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:23:01.326]  By censoring Trump and by doing the mail-in ballots and by what famously Bill Maher said, we need to kill the economy to hurt Trump, that is all the election meddling right there.
[01:23:01.566 --> 01:23:02.607]  He still probably won.
[01:23:02.627 --> 01:23:04.308]  The fraud stopped it, but you're right.
[01:23:04.748 --> 01:23:07.570]  If they wouldn't have done that, his landslide would have been so big they couldn't have stopped it.
[01:23:08.286 --> 01:23:10.367]  Exactly, even without fraud.
[01:23:10.807 --> 01:23:18.188]  The way the media ran a smear campaign on Trump for four years and treated Biden like a king.
[01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:23.910]  The way the media lied about and didn't mention Trump's many accomplishments.
[01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:29.611]  All this thing, the economy, minorities working at levels that had never been seen before in this country.
[01:23:29.911 --> 01:23:32.212]  The only way you were getting him out
[01:23:32.612 --> 01:23:33.413]  We're good to go.
[01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:02.812]  But they're going to tell you that there wasn't any fraud.
[01:24:03.012 --> 01:24:19.148]  And again, even without the fraud, the way the media acted, and the way the liberals and the Democrats impeached Trump, and all this garbage over four years... And all the attempted coups, all the attempted coups, and going back, Trump said it!
[01:24:19.648 --> 01:24:22.129]  They said in Wisconsin, in Michigan, he's behind 20 points.
[01:24:22.169 --> 01:24:23.230]  He's behind 17 points.
[01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:25.031]  Those were all that make people not come out.
[01:24:25.071 --> 01:24:27.672]  That's a known poll to keep people from voting.
[01:24:27.712 --> 01:24:28.112]  Absolutely.
[01:24:28.412 --> 01:24:30.693]  Anthony Comey, you are kicking ass as usual.
[01:24:31.253 --> 01:24:32.854]  And I know you're sad to leave New York.
[01:24:32.874 --> 01:24:34.035]  It's a great state, great city.
[01:24:34.055 --> 01:24:37.116]  But I guess you're going to find better pastors in South Carolina.
[01:24:37.196 --> 01:24:39.117]  And we look forward to any time you come to Texas, buddy.
[01:24:39.437 --> 01:24:40.578]  We want to love to have you in the studio.
[01:24:41.565 --> 01:24:41.905]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:41.965 --> 01:24:45.588]  I'm going to be in Austin in May, I believe.
[01:24:45.668 --> 01:24:46.429]  It's May.
[01:24:46.469 --> 01:24:47.770]  We're doing a comedy show down there.
[01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:49.411]  The Comics of the Compound.
[01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:50.772]  Comedians of the Compound.
[01:24:50.792 --> 01:24:52.073]  So we're going to be down in Austin.
[01:24:52.113 --> 01:24:53.894]  Are you going to be on the Joe Rogan Show?
[01:24:53.914 --> 01:24:54.595]  I bet that's going to happen.
[01:24:55.195 --> 01:24:56.336]  I think so, yes.
[01:24:56.416 --> 01:24:57.717]  We're working on that right now.
[01:24:58.678 --> 01:25:01.460]  And I would love to, you know, come and see you if you're down there at that time.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:01.700]  Please.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.801]  My house is your house.
[01:25:02.881 --> 01:25:04.342]  Anthony Comey at compoundmini.com.
[01:25:04.362 --> 01:25:04.682]  Thank you.
[01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:05.883]  Love it.
[01:25:06.442 --> 01:25:08.283]  He's got a great channel, a lot of other great shows.
[01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:09.083]  He's doing it, man.
[01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:10.964]  He built his own thing right around the time we did.
[01:25:11.885 --> 01:25:13.786]  Because he realized it's not enough to be number one.
[01:25:13.846 --> 01:25:14.886]  You gotta have your own platform.
[01:25:14.906 --> 01:25:16.107]  They don't like the number one horse.
[01:25:16.127 --> 01:25:17.768]  They don't like the number one fighter.
[01:25:17.928 --> 01:25:19.108]  They don't like Tom Brady.
[01:25:19.148 --> 01:25:20.949]  They get sick of people that win too much.
[01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:21.810]  It's true.
[01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.911]  That's why I love having other winners on the show.
[01:25:24.151 --> 01:25:25.952]  Briefly, we won't stay on air without your support.
[01:25:25.992 --> 01:25:27.193]  I don't have corporate sponsorship.
[01:25:27.453 --> 01:25:30.394]  Got great supplements, great t-shirts, great water filtration, air filtration.
[01:25:30.774 --> 01:25:32.975]  All of it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:25:34.216 --> 01:25:42.639]  And we've got DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10, the ultimate thing, the platinum standard for your cells, for your mitochondria, for your immunity.
[01:25:42.839 --> 01:25:45.880]  DNA Force Plus, 25% off, though it's selling out, won't have it for months.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.020]  Ultra 12, sold out, back in stock.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.621]  Highest quality B12, taken out of the tongue.
[01:25:49.641 --> 01:25:50.461]  50% off.
[01:25:51.001 --> 01:25:53.102]  Let's put that Ultra 12 up there.
[01:25:53.702 --> 01:25:55.463]  A very great deal on that.
[01:25:56.103 --> 01:25:58.684]  Liquid pure turmeric extract, 50% off, even though it's selling out.
[01:25:58.784 --> 01:26:01.185]  Lung cleanse, 50% off, even though it's selling out.
[01:26:02.907 --> 01:26:07.209]  Special guest coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:26:07.789 --> 01:26:10.810]  But all hell is breaking loose!
[01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:12.971]  We're toe-to-toe with The Globalist.
[01:26:13.351 --> 01:26:14.411]  We'll talk about GameStop.
[01:26:14.431 --> 01:26:15.231]  We'll talk about silver.
[01:26:15.251 --> 01:26:16.412]  We'll talk about the economy and more.
[01:26:17.752 --> 01:26:23.874]  Gregory Manorino is a very popular analyst and talk show host dealing with the economy.
[01:26:24.355 --> 01:26:26.095]  And I'm familiar with his work.
[01:26:26.115 --> 01:26:26.795]  The listeners love him.
[01:26:27.276 --> 01:26:28.276]  So I want to get him on.
[01:26:28.296 --> 01:26:29.456]  He's joining us next segment.
[01:26:29.476 --> 01:26:30.597]  But here's part of a report
[01:26:31.508 --> 01:26:36.131]  America Strikes Back, Governor DeSantis launches bold crackdown against Big Tech cartel.
[01:26:36.171 --> 01:26:38.392]  We'll be back in just about five minutes with our guest.
[01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:42.675]  Florida consumers deserve protection for their privacy.
[01:26:43.175 --> 01:26:51.240]  With the help of our legislative partners, we're going to stand together in support of Floridians and put a stop to Big Tech's practice of preying on consumers.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.242]  Your privacy is important.
[01:27:06.365 --> 01:27:11.328]  Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida is doing what Trump should have done.
[01:27:12.388 --> 01:27:28.798]  He has laid out in a powerful 45-minute speech posted below in the links that the big tech companies have set up a monopoly of political, corporate, and financial control over America and are acting as an organized crime syndicate.
[01:27:29.736 --> 01:27:34.100]  Imagine if big telecoms would have spied on their users and then censored them.
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:35.021]  People wouldn't put up with it.
[01:27:35.621 --> 01:27:38.844]  Imagine if any other sector of government would have done this.
[01:27:38.864 --> 01:27:39.865]  There would be a revolution.
[01:27:40.766 --> 01:27:46.711]  But because big tech is acting as if it's a corporate government, outside of law they've gotten away with it.
[01:27:47.192 --> 01:27:51.556]  Big tech on record admits that they spy on you from Spotify,
[01:27:52.728 --> 01:27:53.548]  We're good to go.
[01:28:16.698 --> 01:28:16.858]  I think?
[01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:38.131]  Trump's not the villain here.
[01:28:38.211 --> 01:28:38.951]  He just should have done it.
[01:28:39.672 --> 01:28:42.174]  It's the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott.
[01:28:42.874 --> 01:28:46.837]  I mean, he is in the pocket of Apple and Google and Facebook and Twitter that have all moved here.
[01:28:47.657 --> 01:28:49.679]  He is going along with masks forever.
[01:28:50.499 --> 01:28:53.081]  He is going along with the inoculations, all of it.
[01:28:53.482 --> 01:29:03.929]  DeSantis is the one leading the way out of this saying, basically COVID's an overblown hoax, that they're counting the flu deaths, the deaths from pneumonia, gunshots, car wrecks, motorcycle accidents.
[01:29:03.969 --> 01:29:04.730]  Cancer is that.
[01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.370]  And
[01:29:18.973 --> 01:29:20.914]  Run for Senate or run for Vice President.
[01:29:20.974 --> 01:29:22.295]  But they can't wait.
[01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:24.236]  They've got to rally Americans now.
[01:29:24.457 --> 01:29:26.498]  I wish Greg Abbott was a good guy.
[01:29:26.518 --> 01:29:26.838]  He's not.
[01:29:27.358 --> 01:29:28.499]  He knows all these facts.
[01:29:29.159 --> 01:29:30.020]  I know people that know him.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.622]  But he's decided to go along with Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the Great Reset.
[01:29:34.163 --> 01:29:36.924]  So there's an article on Infowars.com that has the full video.
[01:29:36.984 --> 01:29:41.307]  Governor DeSantis unveils crackdown against big tech cartel over rampant censorship.
[01:29:41.467 --> 01:29:41.908]  And that's it.
[01:29:42.688 --> 01:29:43.989]  This is beyond just censorship.
[01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:52.836]  This is a cartel that spies on you, that controls you, that gets political money and foreign money to suppress American patriots and nationalists.
[01:29:53.196 --> 01:30:00.522]  They promote communist Chinese propaganda, and Iranian propaganda, and Saudi Arabian propaganda, and Hollywood propaganda, and EU propaganda.
[01:30:00.762 --> 01:30:05.226]  But everybody that's nationalistic, everybody that's patriotic, everybody that's American in common sense,
[01:30:06.496 --> 01:30:07.096]  We're muzzled.
[01:30:07.136 --> 01:30:07.776]  We're silenced.
[01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:08.917]  We are shut down.
[01:30:09.197 --> 01:30:11.877]  So here's some of the things that he laid out in his speech.
[01:30:12.017 --> 01:30:14.938]  Mandatory op-outs for big tech content filters.
[01:30:15.338 --> 01:30:16.779]  A solution to tech censorship.
[01:30:17.099 --> 01:30:21.680]  A private right of action for Floridian residents against tech companies that violate the condition.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:29.062]  Fines of $100,000 per day levied on tech companies that suspend candidates for elected office in Florida from their platforms.
[01:30:29.422 --> 01:30:32.422]  That's the big election meddling like Laura Loomer and others.
[01:30:32.682 --> 01:30:34.363]  But they're doing it to even make mainline
[01:30:35.364 --> 01:30:36.627]  Senators elect.
[01:30:37.208 --> 01:30:39.914]  Senators that are already in office, who are incumbents.
[01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.458]  They're even blocking Senators and House members.
[01:30:41.478 --> 01:30:42.540]  I mean, this is bold.
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:54.326]  Daily fines for any tech company that uses their content and user-related algorithms to suppress or promote access to any of content related to a political candidate or cause on the ballot.
[01:30:54.826 --> 01:30:56.587]  Greater transparency requirements.
[01:30:56.968 --> 01:31:02.711]  Disclosure of requirements enforced by Florida's election authorities for tech companies that pick one candidate over another.
[01:31:03.231 --> 01:31:04.252]  Is it banned on video?
[01:31:04.332 --> 01:31:05.453]  It's America Strikes Back.
[01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:08.674]  Governor DeSantis launches bold crackdown against big tech.
[01:31:08.734 --> 01:31:09.415]  This is exciting.
[01:31:10.711 --> 01:31:11.251]  Welcome back.
[01:31:11.291 --> 01:31:13.693]  Gregory Manorino is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:31:13.713 --> 01:31:20.937]  I'm going to go over his whole bio, but he is a successful, world-following trader, full-time trader.
[01:31:21.458 --> 01:31:22.879]  He's known as the Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[01:31:23.746 --> 01:31:27.149]  And he goes on to have a medical degree and a bunch of other stuff and been in the Navy.
[01:31:27.569 --> 01:31:29.071]  I'm not going to break down his whole bio.
[01:31:29.531 --> 01:31:38.519]  He's published a book on casino, blackjack strategies, YouTube, Gregory Manorino, traderschoice.net, traderschoice.net.
[01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:40.240]  And I just, I followed some of his work.
[01:31:40.281 --> 01:31:41.582]  Listeners have mentioned him to me.
[01:31:41.622 --> 01:31:43.824]  I thought we should get him on the broadcast.
[01:31:45.063 --> 01:32:01.856]  To really sit back and talk about what's happening, because when you got Janet Yellen getting close to a million dollars from Citadel and these other brokerage firms, you've got her making decisions about GameStop and about this Robin Hood company, this free trading deal, not to be confused with our guest.
[01:32:02.637 --> 01:32:18.372]  And you just see this to see the CNBC headlines and CNN headlines and Forbes headlines about it's the it's the hedge funds that are the heroes and it's the little guys that are the bad people and you're compared to terrorists, compared to the Capitol, incels, unhappy people.
[01:32:18.392 --> 01:32:22.737]  I mean, wow, this is little guys doing what big guys have done with this short squeeze.
[01:32:23.457 --> 01:32:24.697]  And so I want to get his take on that.
[01:32:25.297 --> 01:32:30.539]  I'm no rocket scientist, but I said early last week, I said, I bet silver just explodes once people figure out that real short squeeze.
[01:32:30.579 --> 01:32:31.319]  And now it's happening.
[01:32:31.339 --> 01:32:32.579]  They can't keep up with physical demand.
[01:32:32.999 --> 01:32:34.000]  People are demanding physical.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:40.221]  We'll cover the waterfront because even if you're not invested in the stock market, this affects everything with Gregory Manorino.
[01:32:40.561 --> 01:32:41.961]  So thanks for coming on with us, my friend.
[01:32:43.422 --> 01:32:44.562]  Alex, it's great to be here.
[01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:45.302]  It's about time.
[01:32:45.342 --> 01:32:46.763]  I'm glad we're finally getting together.
[01:32:47.003 --> 01:32:47.943]  The truth.
[01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:49.463]  Well, it's great to have you here.
[01:32:49.723 --> 01:32:50.483]  Where do you want to start?
[01:32:50.503 --> 01:32:51.284]  You're a smart guy.
[01:32:51.544 --> 01:32:52.524]  What's really going on right now?
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:56.201]  Well, I'll tell you, I almost don't know where to begin.
[01:32:56.361 --> 01:33:00.282]  Let me just set the scene for everyone so they can understand my take on it.
[01:33:00.802 --> 01:33:06.143]  We are now in the biggest freak show in the history of the world.
[01:33:06.163 --> 01:33:09.684]  There's nothing that even comes close to this with regard to the financial markets.
[01:33:09.744 --> 01:33:11.925]  I mean, it's gotten to a point of
[01:33:12.961 --> 01:33:15.664]  Pure rigging, pure manipulation.
[01:33:15.684 --> 01:33:17.305]  It's in our face.
[01:33:18.026 --> 01:33:26.935]  People are trying to rise up and do something, but the powers that be here are determined to squash everything in their pathway.
[01:33:26.955 --> 01:33:29.498]  I mean, what do we have going on here?
[01:33:29.898 --> 01:33:32.681]  We have, at its core, what is the core of
[01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:38.071]  The rigging and the manipulation of the financial markets, it's very simple.
[01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:51.033]  It's World Central Banks, none more so than the Federal Reserve, who are finishing what they started in 1913, the inception of the Federal Reserve, which is to be the lender and buyer of last resort.
[01:33:51.073 --> 01:33:52.534]  They want to own it all.
[01:33:52.694 --> 01:33:54.074]  They want to own the world.
[01:33:54.474 --> 01:33:57.555]  And these institutions are criminal cartels.
[01:33:57.615 --> 01:33:58.895]  No one knows this better than you do.
[01:33:59.775 --> 01:34:19.689]  And they are involved in a market rigging scheme, the likes of which we've never seen in the history of the world, artificially suppressing rates now for over an entire decade, robbing the middle class blind of trillions in realized wealth, fostering a massive wealth transfer to the upper echelon of society.
[01:34:19.729 --> 01:34:22.551]  We have now brokerages participating in this.
[01:34:22.911 --> 01:34:24.132]  It's a rigged game.
[01:34:24.572 --> 01:34:26.533]  It's an unbelievably rigged game.
[01:34:26.593 --> 01:34:28.875]  No one should know this better than me, because this is all I do.
[01:34:29.835 --> 01:34:35.577]  And my job is to try to let people understand what's happening and why it's happening.
[01:34:35.597 --> 01:34:44.520]  This is a global takeover by the central banks who are working in concert, OK, to literally own it all.
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:47.701]  And, you know, they're propping up the stock market artificially.
[01:34:47.781 --> 01:34:50.542]  Wall Street right now, highest bonuses on record.
[01:34:52.884 --> 01:34:56.927]  Well, you've got the public here suffering.
[01:34:57.227 --> 01:34:58.748]  Homelessness exploding.
[01:34:59.049 --> 01:35:02.191]  You've got the Federal Reserve's balance sheet last year that almost doubled.
[01:35:02.291 --> 01:35:04.553]  No one's paying attention to what's going on here.
[01:35:04.653 --> 01:35:05.374]  It's insane.
[01:35:05.494 --> 01:35:06.515]  Completely insane.
[01:35:07.215 --> 01:35:12.840]  But it's a big scam on the people and what we're seeing lately with the brokerages and all part of it.
[01:35:14.161 --> 01:35:15.462]  Let me ask this question.
[01:35:16.663 --> 01:35:23.668]  Are the hedge funds legitimately scared because their body language is they're really scared that if the public ever figures out their tricks, their power is gone.
[01:35:24.088 --> 01:35:27.030]  But if they try to bring in regulators against the little guy, nobody's going to buy that.
[01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:32.835]  So this really seems like the beginning of the end somehow or seems like something big is happening.
[01:35:33.735 --> 01:35:35.857]  Well, you're absolutely right on this point.
[01:35:36.378 --> 01:35:38.860]  Truth is the only answer here.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:44.625]  And the fact of the matter is, we have, and as you talk about all the time, we have politicians here that are on the take.
[01:35:44.645 --> 01:35:47.188]  They're all bought and paid, for the most part, they're bought and paid for.
[01:35:47.548 --> 01:35:49.630]  They do not have our best interest in mind.
[01:35:49.890 --> 01:35:51.632]  Their best interest is with the big money.
[01:35:52.632 --> 01:35:53.513]  What are they trying to do?
[01:35:53.553 --> 01:35:55.254]  What's the grand plan here?
[01:35:55.594 --> 01:35:59.617]  I've been outlining for an entire decade that we are going back to a feudal system.
[01:36:00.637 --> 01:36:04.840]  Extreme haves, extreme have-nots, middle class is being erased.
[01:36:05.561 --> 01:36:08.242]  I've said that people have a target tattooed on their face.
[01:36:08.622 --> 01:36:12.405]  If you're a member of the middle class, they're trying to destroy you.
[01:36:13.742 --> 01:36:16.485]  Uh, and they're doing a damn good job of it now with the hedge funds here.
[01:36:16.505 --> 01:36:20.328]  Look, if you let's just go over that real quick, because it's an unbelievable scam.
[01:36:20.668 --> 01:36:21.469]  So we understand.
[01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:24.251]  I mean, it's common knowledge would happen with GameStop.
[01:36:24.291 --> 01:36:29.356]  You had hedge funds shorting the stock to the highest possible order.
[01:36:30.354 --> 01:36:31.254]  And then what happened?
[01:36:31.314 --> 01:36:40.417]  Well, it looked like there was a short squeeze that went on here, initiated initially by retail traders, and it was working.
[01:36:40.777 --> 01:36:47.580]  And then all of a sudden you got the brokerages here who got in here and said, oh, no, no, no, no, we can't allow that to happen.
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:49.400]  And it wasn't just Robinhood.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:53.821]  I mean, my own personal broker, I used to go through TD Ameritrade, was involved as well.
[01:36:53.881 --> 01:36:54.442]  I dumped them.
[01:36:54.502 --> 01:36:55.522]  I fired my own broker.
[01:36:55.542 --> 01:36:58.443]  I said, fine, I'll find somebody else here.
[01:36:59.003 --> 01:37:07.509]  But, you know, the game is now rigged so severely against the average guy and the average girl.
[01:37:08.590 --> 01:37:10.511]  It's a very difficult battle for us to win.
[01:37:10.751 --> 01:37:13.793]  But again, I think we can win if we have enough of us.
[01:37:14.254 --> 01:37:20.078]  You see, look, guys like you, guys like me, Joe Celente, a lot of other people out here are trying to raise
[01:37:20.858 --> 01:37:21.138]  Yeah.
[01:37:35.788 --> 01:37:44.279]  Look at how big tech came in to try to defend and censor tens of millions of even positive comments for the Redditors.
[01:37:44.339 --> 01:37:49.045]  I mean, this is massive coordinated oppression, racketeering on a scale never before seen.
[01:37:49.326 --> 01:37:53.131]  Whole classes of people silenced and targeted for corrupt, greedy hedge funds.
[01:37:53.151 --> 01:37:53.992]  I mean, this is sickening.
[01:37:54.935 --> 01:37:55.996]  It's beyond sickening.
[01:37:56.076 --> 01:38:01.583]  It's the hedge funds, it's the investment banks at the core of the whole damn shitshow.
[01:38:01.683 --> 01:38:02.744]  I'm sorry I used that language.
[01:38:03.445 --> 01:38:04.486]  It's the central banks.
[01:38:04.526 --> 01:38:06.509]  The central banks today.
[01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:19.301]  Are the government they are running the world via the financial system and the financial system is toxic beyond the point of, you know, belief at this particular point.
[01:38:19.361 --> 01:38:22.123]  I mean, we're in the midst of a massive wealth transfer.
[01:38:22.403 --> 01:38:26.666]  Like I said earlier, the middle class is being wiped out by design.
[01:38:26.846 --> 01:38:28.788]  Everything is by design Alex.
[01:38:28.808 --> 01:38:30.369]  Let me put another perspective on this.
[01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:34.393]  We understand what's going on with what I call the scandemic here.
[01:38:34.814 --> 01:38:43.343]  Okay, the central banks, who's benefiting from what we're seeing here with regard to the coronavirus scandemic or whatever you want to put it?
[01:38:43.363 --> 01:38:45.245]  It's the central banks and big pharma.
[01:38:45.645 --> 01:38:49.530]  Okay, what they did is successfully shut down the global economy.
[01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:53.272]  The central banks successfully shut down the global economy.
[01:38:53.372 --> 01:38:55.073]  Why would they want to do something like that?
[01:38:55.393 --> 01:39:01.617]  So they can kill what's known as the money velocity, or the rate at which cash moves through our economy.
[01:39:02.017 --> 01:39:07.660]  By doing this, they can go wild and vastly inflate their balance sheets.
[01:39:07.721 --> 01:39:10.082]  Again, last year, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet nearly doubled.
[01:39:10.742 --> 01:39:13.706]  Uh, went from $4.4 trillion to almost- Quantify that!
[01:39:13.746 --> 01:39:20.773]  They have an inflation problem creating all these derivatives and all this extra money for them that they get first use of that would show the hyperinflation.
[01:39:21.074 --> 01:39:28.702]  But if they stagnate and create a depression for us, it then hides that wealth, secures it only to them, which they can then use to buy up our real assets.
[01:39:29.844 --> 01:39:31.005]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:39:31.045 --> 01:39:41.730]  By killing the economy, by shutting off the rate at which cash moves to the economy, it allows them to inflate vastly without the risk of massive and hyperinflation.
[01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:47.993]  To get hyperinflation, you need cash moving through the economy, the world economy.
[01:39:48.033 --> 01:39:52.015]  So they killed the global economy so the central banks can inflate.
[01:39:52.495 --> 01:40:00.543]  The central bank, the Federal Reserve, is funneling dollars around the world to central banks around the world, effectively dollarizing the world.
[01:40:00.943 --> 01:40:07.390]  And these central banks are buying assets, just like you said, with dollars, not even their own currency.
[01:40:07.670 --> 01:40:10.012]  So they're dollarizing the world because they can.
[01:40:10.232 --> 01:40:11.714]  They killed the money velocity.
[01:40:12.014 --> 01:40:15.958]  There's no chance right now of a massive hyperinflationary event occurring.
[01:40:16.158 --> 01:40:18.259]  Gregory Manorino, you're on fire.
[01:40:18.319 --> 01:40:18.739]  Stay there.
[01:40:18.819 --> 01:40:23.060]  Come back and talk about the dangers of this, how this could break the different scenarios.
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.901]  I mean, I can see the scenarios myself, and I'm not an expert like you, but every avenue I look down looks really scary.
[01:40:28.221 --> 01:40:29.921]  What avenue is best for the average person?
[01:40:29.981 --> 01:40:30.602]  What's moral?
[01:40:30.902 --> 01:40:31.502]  What should we know?
[01:40:31.582 --> 01:40:32.242]  What should we do?
[01:40:32.262 --> 01:40:33.802]  Gregory Manorino is our guest.
[01:40:33.822 --> 01:40:35.943]  You can find him at traderschoice.net.
[01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:36.543]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:39.344]  You can find us at band.video and infowars.com.
[01:40:39.364 --> 01:40:43.285]  The only way that dog hunts, folks, is you share those links, and I appreciate you doing it.
[01:40:43.525 --> 01:40:44.065]  That's how we win.
[01:40:45.233 --> 01:40:48.194]  Gregory Manorino is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[01:40:48.214 --> 01:40:50.735]  Then we have a special guest in the fourth hour as well, I'll tell you about.
[01:40:52.196 --> 01:40:53.676]  And listen, I'm not complaining up there.
[01:40:54.176 --> 01:40:54.796]  I'm not bitching.
[01:40:55.597 --> 01:41:10.202]  Our audience was, let's not exaggerate, at the peak it ever was in 2016 for the election, we had, clicking different IP addresses on our audio and video feeds on our own platforms, 80-something million people in one week.
[01:41:10.642 --> 01:41:11.442]  And the system knew that.
[01:41:11.462 --> 01:41:12.803]  It was the biggest show in the world at that point.
[01:41:13.793 --> 01:41:16.494]  And before that, you know, we probably had 3 or 4 million listeners a day.
[01:41:16.514 --> 01:41:16.954]  That's great.
[01:41:17.454 --> 01:41:17.854]  I love it.
[01:41:17.934 --> 01:41:19.575]  I mean, I just want a bullhorn to fight tyranny.
[01:41:19.995 --> 01:41:22.296]  I'd love to retire next week if we could just defeat this thing or back it off.
[01:41:23.376 --> 01:41:30.358]  But now, under the deplatforming, we were as low as a million viewers or listeners a day a couple years ago, but it built back up under the censorship.
[01:41:30.398 --> 01:41:40.801]  It built back up with what we said came true, where we've been having 5 million views a day or more on Bandop video, 3 or 4 million people dialing into our own streams, not to mention hundreds of radio stations, all of it.
[01:41:41.991 --> 01:41:45.493]  But the frustration is, there's not more money coming in.
[01:41:46.113 --> 01:41:48.675]  I don't have George Soros there, folks, cutting me giant checks.
[01:41:48.695 --> 01:41:53.497]  You read about Soros giving some of these Democrat websites $500 million a year?
[01:41:54.118 --> 01:41:56.859]  I mean, just my bandwidth and tech costs are $20 million a year.
[01:41:57.179 --> 01:41:58.020]  Sounds like a huge number.
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:59.160]  No, money's inflated.
[01:41:59.741 --> 01:42:03.863]  And so I've got to sell a lot of Trader Joe's t-shirts to keep this place on the air.
[01:42:04.898 --> 01:42:07.621]  And so we kind of got a little bit in the black in the last few months.
[01:42:07.641 --> 01:42:09.263]  We were almost in the red six months ago.
[01:42:09.483 --> 01:42:11.946]  But if I don't hustle, I'll be back in the red again.
[01:42:12.306 --> 01:42:13.628]  They want to take us off the air.
[01:42:13.668 --> 01:42:17.252]  So everybody get a Traders Joe's t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:42:17.312 --> 01:42:23.499]  It's him as a trader, Joe Biden, the fake president, with the communist Chinese, the Russians, the Iranians, and the Ukrainians.
[01:42:24.850 --> 01:42:26.191]  That's their governments, not their people.
[01:42:26.251 --> 01:42:26.991]  It's a great shirt.
[01:42:27.051 --> 01:42:27.652]  Get it today.
[01:42:27.692 --> 01:42:28.472]  Get your supplements.
[01:42:28.592 --> 01:42:29.533]  Everybody needs vitamin B12.
[01:42:29.593 --> 01:42:31.354]  We got the highest quality, highest rated.
[01:42:31.414 --> 01:42:37.598]  It's back in stock 50% off Ultra 12 and a lot of other specials as well at infowarestore.com.
[01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:45.003]  All right, going back to Gregory Manarino, who's a very popular trader and talk show host and the Robin Hood of Wall Street.
[01:42:45.403 --> 01:42:46.864]  Obviously a very well spoken guy.
[01:42:47.184 --> 01:42:49.426]  Everything he said in the last segment is dead on true.
[01:42:50.086 --> 01:42:53.729]  So you were talking about a global war to consolidate power by big banks.
[01:42:54.289 --> 01:43:00.931]  The hedge funds are just their hyenas that bring us down and attack us, like the economic hitman John Perkins exposed a decade ago.
[01:43:00.951 --> 01:43:01.591]  You're absolutely right.
[01:43:02.371 --> 01:43:03.791]  So what's the next shoe to drop?
[01:43:04.091 --> 01:43:05.332]  How's their takeover going?
[01:43:05.652 --> 01:43:07.052]  How do we fight back so many points?
[01:43:08.252 --> 01:43:09.193]  Well, I'll tell you real quick.
[01:43:09.233 --> 01:43:14.574]  I mean, we have to look, look, I practiced medicine for 20 years before I went off to do this.
[01:43:15.394 --> 01:43:20.115]  And when you look at any kind of a complicated problem, you have to go to its root cause.
[01:43:20.295 --> 01:43:21.856]  What is the driving force?
[01:43:22.316 --> 01:43:22.516]  Again,
[01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:25.719]  Obviously, it's the banks.
[01:43:25.819 --> 01:43:37.869]  It's the banks that are running the entire show, the entire world, and the hub, the hub of this entire thing, the hub of the New World Order, is the Federal Reserve.
[01:43:37.889 --> 01:43:41.352]  The Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal Express.
[01:43:41.733 --> 01:43:43.454]  They control our motives transaction.
[01:43:43.474 --> 01:43:46.317]  They're funneling dollars to everyone they want to buy off.
[01:43:46.757 --> 01:43:47.297]  The banks.
[01:43:48.962 --> 01:43:53.103]  You got Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup.
[01:43:53.123 --> 01:43:55.084]  These run the Fed.
[01:43:55.204 --> 01:43:56.444]  It's no secret.
[01:43:56.504 --> 01:43:58.985]  It's private banks, private institutions.
[01:43:59.545 --> 01:44:09.847]  We need to direct our attention at the root cause of the problem, the root cause of everything we're seeing here, the puppet government that's been a puppet government for quite a long time.
[01:44:09.867 --> 01:44:10.868]  They're all bought and paid for.
[01:44:10.888 --> 01:44:13.248]  I don't care what- And they're the ones that went to Klaus Schwab.
[01:44:13.268 --> 01:44:15.489]  They admit the IMF, the World Bank are their fronts.
[01:44:16.089 --> 01:44:18.311]  For the Bank of Europe, the Bank of England, the Bank of the U.S.
[01:44:18.351 --> 01:44:19.412]  here, which is really private.
[01:44:19.452 --> 01:44:20.453]  As you said, it's on record.
[01:44:20.793 --> 01:44:24.516]  Just Federal Ammunition or Federal Express or Federal Trash Compactors.
[01:44:24.897 --> 01:44:30.822]  They come in and they set the precedent to say what's essential, what isn't essential, and they call it the Great Reset.
[01:44:30.862 --> 01:44:33.204]  They said, making us poor is good for the Earth.
[01:44:34.508 --> 01:44:35.569]  It's an incredible situation.
[01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:36.531]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:44:36.571 --> 01:44:37.652]  People are buying into it.
[01:44:37.752 --> 01:44:39.154]  I cannot believe what I'm seeing.
[01:44:39.494 --> 01:44:46.904]  I mean, that's why, you know, I get, I don't know how much you watch my show, but I get kind of riled up like you do once in a while when you just can't handle it.
[01:44:46.944 --> 01:44:49.187]  Yeah, you go crazy.
[01:44:49.227 --> 01:44:52.251]  You know, you just, sometimes this stuff gets to you, but the truth is,
[01:44:53.268 --> 01:45:00.173]  We, I am so happy that there are people like you and myself and other guys, Joe Soletti, trying to get out the truth here.
[01:45:00.473 --> 01:45:03.775]  Trying to let people understand what they're actually seeing is real.
[01:45:04.075 --> 01:45:06.737]  You got the mainstream media, all of it, every single bit of it.
[01:45:06.777 --> 01:45:07.718]  They're bought and paid for.
[01:45:07.758 --> 01:45:08.358]  They're puppets.
[01:45:08.378 --> 01:45:10.239]  They're told what to say, when to say it.
[01:45:10.379 --> 01:45:12.801]  People like you and me, we say what we want to say.
[01:45:13.061 --> 01:45:17.264]  Because, you know, we understand and the people that at least follow our work know the truth when they hear it.
[01:45:17.304 --> 01:45:19.045]  What would happen if the public ever got this?
[01:45:19.085 --> 01:45:23.088]  Isn't GameStop at AMC the start of people getting the power they have, period?
[01:45:24.108 --> 01:45:24.729]  You know something?
[01:45:24.849 --> 01:45:32.093]  I am really happy you brought that up because I am hoping that, yes, that people are going to start to see how absolutely rigged this is.
[01:45:32.133 --> 01:45:38.216]  Look, I'm out here every day, twice a day during the week, trying to talk about, you know, how this market is rigged.
[01:45:38.236 --> 01:45:46.620]  But I'm also telling people this opportunity, OK, where there is some rigging like this and fakery and propaganda and look here, don't look here.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:48.881]  This is an environment of opportunity.
[01:45:49.162 --> 01:45:51.883]  So what I say to people is, OK, we know what they're doing.
[01:45:52.244 --> 01:45:54.605]  The central banks are going to inflate on a vast scale.
[01:45:54.645 --> 01:46:02.991]  They have the brokerages, you know, bought and paid for as well, you know, limiting the retail trader.
[01:46:03.011 --> 01:46:06.454]  Their profit used to be here in the United States.
[01:46:06.494 --> 01:46:09.015]  If you made a good investment, you know, it paid off for you.
[01:46:09.035 --> 01:46:09.756]  But not anymore.
[01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:10.717]  Not anymore.
[01:46:11.017 --> 01:46:12.818]  No, you're only allowed to sell your assets.
[01:46:12.838 --> 01:46:13.839]  You're not allowed to buy them.
[01:46:13.919 --> 01:46:15.400]  Or maybe you can be very restricted.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.541]  Let me give you an example.
[01:46:16.641 --> 01:46:18.303]  We've got a ranch in East Texas.
[01:46:18.323 --> 01:46:19.745]  We know a lot of other ranchers and farms.
[01:46:19.825 --> 01:46:26.213]  And the way they have the cattle business and the meatpackers, no matter how much you sell the cow for, the way the taxes work, you never make money.
[01:46:26.493 --> 01:46:30.638]  But because there's only three meatpackers instead of 100 in the U.S., they all make the money.
[01:46:30.698 --> 01:46:35.184]  So a steak that costs 50 bucks at a steakhouse, you might get a dollar, you know, for that.
[01:46:35.644 --> 01:46:36.745]  So there's nothing there.
[01:46:36.805 --> 01:46:39.587]  So then, my dad's got a few oil wells and gas wells.
[01:46:39.627 --> 01:46:42.528]  Well, in the old days, we had neighbors that made a lot of money.
[01:46:42.768 --> 01:46:47.591]  The way it all works now, the way they run the taxes and the regulations, you basically end up making no money.
[01:46:48.032 --> 01:46:53.335]  So even if you, quote, have gas wells on your own property, you get almost no money because you're not a multinational corporation.
[01:46:53.355 --> 01:46:55.176]  They have gamed every angle of it.
[01:46:56.653 --> 01:46:57.233]  Absolutely.
[01:46:57.634 --> 01:47:01.316]  Not only have they gained every angle of it, they know every angle of it.
[01:47:01.336 --> 01:47:02.957]  And that's the whole they anticipate things.
[01:47:03.057 --> 01:47:11.482]  When they see something going on, you're like, let's say the public wants to make a stand against GME or a particular asset, SLV, silver, whatever it might be.
[01:47:11.522 --> 01:47:12.202]  They're ready.
[01:47:12.262 --> 01:47:13.303]  They're ready for it.
[01:47:14.203 --> 01:47:17.385]  And it's a shame here because what people need to understand
[01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:22.791]  Never, ever, ever in the history of the world have we witnessed what we're seeing now.
[01:47:23.071 --> 01:47:28.754]  We have a stock market near all-time record highs and an economy in freefall by design.
[01:47:29.034 --> 01:47:33.616]  Nothing, nothing that we are seeing here is by accident.
[01:47:33.856 --> 01:47:35.397]  Every single thing
[01:47:35.917 --> 01:47:39.520]  It's all been thought out in advance and then released.
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:40.601]  That's what they do.
[01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:43.763]  They're our think tanks that say, okay, what are we going to do?
[01:47:44.023 --> 01:47:45.525]  How are we going to manipulate the public?
[01:47:45.565 --> 01:47:47.166]  How are we going to rig the financial markets?
[01:47:47.186 --> 01:47:48.267]  And by the way, you're not just saying that.
[01:47:48.307 --> 01:47:49.127]  We'll come back and talk about it.
[01:47:49.147 --> 01:47:55.792]  They have literally thousands of think tanks, dozens of top ones that get billions, like Rand Corporation, you name it.
[01:47:56.033 --> 01:48:00.296]  And they look at every conceivable scenario and mixed scenario for what they're going to do.
[01:48:00.316 --> 01:48:02.798]  And then they pull a file off the shelf when it happens and implement.
[01:48:04.187 --> 01:48:04.627]  Exactly!
[01:48:04.887 --> 01:48:05.788]  Then they implement it.
[01:48:06.408 --> 01:48:06.968]  What do they do?
[01:48:07.188 --> 01:48:10.329]  They get the mainstream media outlets to push an agenda.
[01:48:10.949 --> 01:48:17.771]  Their main tactic, okay, and you know this I think better than anybody on the planet, is to control people by fear.
[01:48:18.252 --> 01:48:24.954]  Make people afraid of one thing, just one, like a virus for example, and you control their minds.
[01:48:25.454 --> 01:48:26.534]  It's an epic thing.
[01:48:26.574 --> 01:48:30.475]  They want people paralyzed and the more fear that the mainstream
[01:48:32.476 --> 01:48:32.997]  We're good to go.
[01:49:00.296 --> 01:49:13.480]  And you can visit his site at traderschoice.net, traderschoice.net, Gregory Manarino, again, I'm Alex Jones, and I cannot ask the listeners again, from the bottom of my heart, when I say this, it's not just to pat you on the head, you're the reason we're still on air.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:23.123]  Keep spreading the word about the broadcast, keep telling folks, here's the forbidden fruit, here's the real info, and share it, and tell them to share it, and tell them to tell them to share it.
[01:49:23.143 --> 01:49:26.204]  I actually looked this up this morning,
[01:49:27.711 --> 01:49:32.694]  Under the top 10 big tech companies in the U.S., all of them doubled their profits last year.
[01:49:33.294 --> 01:49:36.636]  Some of them doubled in size, not just profits.
[01:49:37.677 --> 01:49:39.058]  And they did it because of the lockdown.
[01:49:39.078 --> 01:49:39.858]  They were all set.
[01:49:39.918 --> 01:49:44.841]  They were all ready because they're run by the same big central banks that create all the currency and credit.
[01:49:44.861 --> 01:49:46.042]  That's why they're all simpatico.
[01:49:46.502 --> 01:49:49.364]  Big tech, big media, big banks, big corporations.
[01:49:49.424 --> 01:49:56.528]  It's all the private Federal Reserve, the private Bank of England, the private EU banks that have unlimited currency and decide
[01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:58.451]  How do we fight back?
[01:49:58.471 --> 01:49:59.812]  What do you expect them to do next?
[01:49:59.852 --> 01:50:00.652]  Because this is a brutal war.
[01:50:00.692 --> 01:50:01.973]  More people produced.
[01:50:18.587 --> 01:50:22.430]  From middle class to poverty in the last year than any time in human history.
[01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:25.051]  Millions and millions extra starving to death, the U.N.
[01:50:25.071 --> 01:50:25.992]  admits, while the U.N.
[01:50:26.012 --> 01:50:27.593]  runs the program for the lockdown.
[01:50:27.673 --> 01:50:29.394]  COVID's not killing them, the lockdown is.
[01:50:29.414 --> 01:50:32.516]  I mean, this is just a new kind of war, isn't it?
[01:50:34.057 --> 01:50:34.938]  Absolutely, it is.
[01:50:35.058 --> 01:50:39.000]  Again, and they're implementing their final... I call it their final solution.
[01:50:39.181 --> 01:50:40.782]  And I've been using that exact term.
[01:50:40.822 --> 01:50:42.943]  I mean, it's a pretty grim phrase.
[01:50:42.983 --> 01:50:44.404]  I think you know what this is from here.
[01:50:44.844 --> 01:50:45.585]  But, you know, look.
[01:50:46.275 --> 01:50:47.917]  This is their endgame.
[01:50:48.337 --> 01:50:52.942]  Their endgame, and I'm talking about those who are running the world.
[01:50:53.242 --> 01:50:58.147]  The core of this entire thing is the central banks.
[01:50:58.967 --> 01:51:04.713]  Governments, government leaders, kings, queens, monarchs or presidents, they do not run a damn thing.
[01:51:04.993 --> 01:51:08.497]  They all have their strings pulled by the central banks.
[01:51:08.557 --> 01:51:10.579]  We have witnessed a hideous merger
[01:51:11.039 --> 01:51:16.564]  Between corporations and a new American system, a new American government.
[01:51:16.624 --> 01:51:20.227]  I've been warning about this for the longest time and it's now in our face.
[01:51:21.628 --> 01:51:28.694]  And again, just like you alluded to, you've got corporations stronger and bigger and more powerful than they have ever been.
[01:51:28.714 --> 01:51:31.376]  Meanwhile, they, not the virus,
[01:51:31.816 --> 01:51:33.757]  They shut down not just the U.S.
[01:51:33.837 --> 01:51:39.540]  economy, but the global economy so they could finish what they started to inflate.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:48.645]  We need to raise the awareness of people that it's the banks, it's the central banks are running the entire show.
[01:51:49.005 --> 01:51:53.207]  Everything else is theater from our congressional leaders and our president.
[01:51:53.888 --> 01:51:57.710]  All of it is a show to get people to look to something.
[01:51:58.110 --> 01:51:59.851]  It's the banks that are running it all.
[01:52:00.675 --> 01:52:01.035]  All of it.
[01:52:01.295 --> 01:52:02.556]  They pull the strings.
[01:52:02.656 --> 01:52:03.136]  Period.
[01:52:03.156 --> 01:52:03.776]  The end.
[01:52:04.177 --> 01:52:07.838]  I've discussed this to the point of nauseam on my show.
[01:52:08.858 --> 01:52:10.259]  And again, the proof is in our face.
[01:52:10.299 --> 01:52:11.079]  Look what they've done.
[01:52:11.119 --> 01:52:13.220]  They've killed the economy so they can inflate.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:16.101]  They've killed the economy so they can buy it all.
[01:52:16.402 --> 01:52:18.903]  The Fed is buying it all right now.
[01:52:19.063 --> 01:52:19.723]  Everything.
[01:52:19.743 --> 01:52:23.465]  And again, there are hundreds of central banks around the world.
[01:52:23.565 --> 01:52:26.586]  It's like a disgusting hands that are crushing us.
[01:52:27.106 --> 01:52:29.310]  Squashing out our liberties and our freedoms.
[01:52:29.610 --> 01:52:30.912]  But what can we do about it?
[01:52:31.393 --> 01:52:32.835]  Awareness is number one.
[01:52:33.136 --> 01:52:33.676]  Number two.
[01:52:34.077 --> 01:52:34.678]  Number two.
[01:52:35.219 --> 01:52:36.481]  Use this to your advantage.
[01:52:37.287 --> 01:52:40.348]  For every action, there is a reaction.
[01:52:40.368 --> 01:52:42.288]  There's a cause and there is an effect.
[01:52:42.548 --> 01:52:45.469]  You do not want to be an effect.
[01:52:45.749 --> 01:52:48.450]  You want to be a cause, meaning you want to take action.
[01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:49.710]  What action should you be taking?
[01:52:49.770 --> 01:52:52.511]  I'll tell you from a financial standpoint what you need to do.
[01:52:52.531 --> 01:52:54.871]  It could not be more simple.
[01:52:55.191 --> 01:53:02.973]  If we understand that the central banks are running the show and their goal is to vastly inflate, and we're going to
[01:53:03.914 --> 01:53:09.099]  Quickly, at one point, move into a currency crisis, a debt crisis, unlike anything we've ever seen by design.
[01:53:09.119 --> 01:53:14.264]  Well, let's talk about that, because there's a lot of ideas, a lot of well-known things, but give us your perspective on that.
[01:53:14.564 --> 01:53:21.251]  I mean, first off, is it internet mobs countering what they do, like GameStop, AMC, and now what's happening with silver?
[01:53:21.431 --> 01:53:25.415]  Because obviously, they can push silver down for a while, but once people figure out that it's 50 to 1, 100 to 1,
[01:53:26.596 --> 01:53:30.703]  Digital versus physical and demanding physical, the mints admit they can't keep it up.
[01:53:30.763 --> 01:53:31.745]  Would that expose them?
[01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:34.810]  Or do people get into real estate knowing it's going to be hyperinflated?
[01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:36.012]  Or they get into debt?
[01:53:36.092 --> 01:53:36.853]  Or they get out of debt?
[01:53:36.873 --> 01:53:37.635]  What's your view?
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:40.961]  Well, I think people again need to understand what's going on.
[01:53:41.001 --> 01:53:45.124]  We have the largest bank on the planet by assets.
[01:53:45.804 --> 01:53:48.626]  I'm going to call them out right here and I've been calling them out for the longest time.
[01:53:48.666 --> 01:53:49.366]  This is J.P.
[01:53:49.406 --> 01:53:49.787]  Morgan.
[01:53:50.247 --> 01:53:50.627]  J.P.
[01:53:50.667 --> 01:53:52.528]  Morgan, the Wall Street super bank.
[01:53:53.049 --> 01:53:59.132]  They are essentially the core rigors of the metals markets.
[01:53:59.252 --> 01:54:00.033]  They dump
[01:54:00.766 --> 01:54:08.770]  At points, you will see paper silver, paper gold dumped onto the market more than is mined in an entire year.
[01:54:09.070 --> 01:54:11.491]  Look, the Commodities Exchange is well aware of this.
[01:54:11.611 --> 01:54:12.892]  I know people that work there.
[01:54:13.172 --> 01:54:17.033]  Everyone knows who's doing it, but no one wants to do anything about it.
[01:54:17.374 --> 01:54:19.054]  They say, OK, well, what can we do about it?
[01:54:19.074 --> 01:54:20.855]  You know what I think you should be doing about it?
[01:54:20.955 --> 01:54:21.195]  Good.
[01:54:21.235 --> 01:54:22.636]  You let them play their game.
[01:54:22.696 --> 01:54:25.097]  Let them suppress the price of precious metals.
[01:54:25.137 --> 01:54:27.998]  We know that it should be exponentially higher than it is.
[01:54:28.018 --> 01:54:29.299]  Going back to what I was saying earlier,
[01:54:29.779 --> 01:54:31.740]  This is how we beat the system, okay?
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:33.541]  You don't go with the crowd.
[01:54:33.841 --> 01:54:35.242]  You bet against the system.
[01:54:35.302 --> 01:54:36.923]  You become your own central bank.
[01:54:37.903 --> 01:54:38.584]  And how do you do that?
[01:54:38.624 --> 01:54:41.005]  You let them play their game with regard to metal.
[01:54:41.025 --> 01:54:42.566]  They want to suppress the price of gold.
[01:54:42.826 --> 01:54:46.087]  They want to suppress the price of silver, cryptocurrencies, whatever it might be.
[01:54:46.428 --> 01:54:46.648]  Good.
[01:54:46.768 --> 01:54:47.748]  Let them play their game.
[01:54:47.768 --> 01:54:53.111]  What we're going to do is we're going to take the opposite side of that trade and we're going to acquire it just like they are.
[01:54:53.928 --> 01:54:56.630]  The richest people in the world today, what are they doing?
[01:54:56.690 --> 01:54:58.292]  Are they in dollars?
[01:54:58.612 --> 01:55:00.073]  People who have a few dollars laying around?
[01:55:00.113 --> 01:55:01.774]  No, they're in hard assets.
[01:55:01.814 --> 01:55:04.036]  The market runs in cycles, Alex.
[01:55:04.376 --> 01:55:06.878]  You get risk on, you get risk off.
[01:55:07.239 --> 01:55:12.543]  When you have a risk on environment like we have today, you see stocks going up, up, up, up, up, up.
[01:55:12.643 --> 01:55:18.628]  And other assets, for example, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and yes, cryptocurrencies in my view,
[01:55:19.809 --> 01:55:22.310]  I don't care that Bitcoin is now $36,000.
[01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:24.071]  I told people to stop buying this stuff at nearly $3,000.
[01:55:24.111 --> 01:55:26.873]  It went to $42,000 and I told people, hey, you know, think about pulling profit.
[01:55:26.933 --> 01:55:27.393]  Went down to $27,000.
[01:55:27.453 --> 01:55:28.033]  Now it's at $37,000.
[01:55:28.073 --> 01:55:28.794]  It's going much higher.
[01:55:36.374 --> 01:55:45.896]  We need to understand what actions that we can take to protect ourselves, to protect the people we love, our communities, and understand it's a freak show.
[01:55:46.256 --> 01:55:48.176]  Understand what's really going on here.
[01:55:48.196 --> 01:55:48.576]  Well, that's right.
[01:55:48.596 --> 01:55:54.857]  If you're aware of the freak show, you can cut them off, beat them at their own game, if you have a big group of people or if you're watching closely.
[01:55:55.157 --> 01:55:58.598]  I'm not going into it because it would be consuming to try to study every aspect of the fraud.
[01:55:58.638 --> 01:55:59.338]  We know it's a fraud.
[01:55:59.558 --> 01:56:03.679]  What are some of the things you would, just not giving financial advice, but personally you're doing?
[01:56:05.066 --> 01:56:09.911]  Well, I attack this from every possible angle, every possible angle.
[01:56:09.931 --> 01:56:13.255]  And all everyone that follows my work, I call them my lions who trade with me.
[01:56:13.275 --> 01:56:14.436]  They know exactly what I'm doing.
[01:56:14.456 --> 01:56:18.660]  I'll just tell you, I've been buying physical gold, physical silver.
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.941]  I also own platinum, palladium.
[01:56:19.961 --> 01:56:21.984]  I've been doing this for years and years and years.
[01:56:22.024 --> 01:56:25.968]  I've been buying silver since like, I don't know, maybe it's maybe eight bucks, maybe lower than that.
[01:56:27.148 --> 01:56:32.590]  Uh, gold was maybe, I don't know, $700 or $800 at that particular time, and I don't care what they want to do to it.
[01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:35.810]  It should be exponentially higher based on exploding debt.
[01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:36.911]  I mean, that's the key here.
[01:56:37.351 --> 01:56:38.231]  What are they talking about?
[01:56:38.271 --> 01:56:39.651]  What is Biden talking about?
[01:56:39.851 --> 01:56:41.072]  What is everyone talking about here?
[01:56:41.152 --> 01:56:43.172]  Borrowing more money into existence?
[01:56:43.212 --> 01:56:44.452]  The system is toxic.
[01:56:44.712 --> 01:56:45.653]  We have a debt- And let's explain.
[01:56:45.693 --> 01:56:46.913]  What they do is they have
[01:56:47.653 --> 01:56:58.216]  100, 200, 300, 500 times digital gold and digital silver that they can then sell on the market to drive it down, but they never get called because no one's demanding physical delivery, right?
[01:56:59.677 --> 01:57:00.077]  Exactly.
[01:57:00.117 --> 01:57:09.160]  Well, you know, it's very difficult for people to, let's say if you're buying a paper derivative of gold and or silver to actually get the hard assets.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:09.920]  How do you do it?
[01:57:11.061 --> 01:57:16.265]  Well, me personally, I happen to like ATMEX, American Precious Metals Exchange.
[01:57:16.305 --> 01:57:17.866]  I've been buying from these people for years.
[01:57:17.906 --> 01:57:29.175]  Never one time have I had a problem with these people, not once in over a decade, longer than that, maybe 15 years since I started buying all this stuff here.
[01:57:29.555 --> 01:57:32.738]  So you just think, get the physical thing and that way it sends a chain reaction.
[01:57:33.803 --> 01:57:35.063]  Oh yeah, buy the physical gold.
[01:57:35.104 --> 01:57:35.784]  Bleed them dry.
[01:57:35.804 --> 01:57:37.544]  If they want to play their games, look what happened.
[01:57:37.765 --> 01:57:40.145]  We had, as a matter of fact, I got to do this.
[01:57:40.165 --> 01:57:41.146]  They say that the U.S.
[01:57:41.186 --> 01:57:42.646]  Mint cannot keep up with it.
[01:57:43.207 --> 01:57:44.187]  And it's exponential now.
[01:57:45.327 --> 01:57:45.928]  Absolutely.
[01:57:46.208 --> 01:57:50.789]  I've been telling people that there's going to be a moment when there's nothing left here.
[01:57:51.490 --> 01:57:53.831]  And that's when this whole thing is going to break.
[01:57:54.151 --> 01:58:00.013]  But again, what we need to focus on here, again, a lot of people talking about a big market crash, a meltdown.
[01:58:00.053 --> 01:58:02.374]  Yeah, sure, that is going to happen because that's part of the endgame.
[01:58:02.954 --> 01:58:09.219]  But when people sit there and they're staring at the Dow Jones Industrial Average, they must realize they're looking in the wrong spot.
[01:58:09.539 --> 01:58:13.802]  You've got to follow the debt market, the debt market or specifically the 10-year yield.
[01:58:14.122 --> 01:58:18.865]  The 10-year yield or the debt market, as in aggregate, is the largest part of this market.
[01:58:18.905 --> 01:58:20.827]  People are like, oh, look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
[01:58:21.207 --> 01:58:25.531]  It's the debt that's got the quadrillions, that's where the pie and just the insanity is.
[01:58:25.791 --> 01:58:28.713]  Let's come back and talk about that with our guest again on Alex Jones.
[01:58:28.733 --> 01:58:31.836]  If you just tuned in to this local radio station, this is a great radio station.
[01:58:31.876 --> 01:58:37.040]  Please tell folks about the station, become a sponsor, support the sponsor, thank the station, or give them a hundred bucks.
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:39.982]  Seriously, your local church isn't fighting abortion, we are.
[01:58:40.302 --> 01:58:41.864]  So support that local station.
[01:58:42.144 --> 01:58:43.925]  Gregory Manorino is our guest.
[01:58:44.266 --> 01:58:45.306]  He's with TradersChoice.net.
[01:58:45.987 --> 01:58:48.689]  We'll be right back, and I'm with Band.Video.
[01:58:48.729 --> 01:58:49.509]  Like, it's been banned.
[01:58:49.549 --> 01:58:50.370]  It's been blacklisted.
[01:58:50.630 --> 01:58:51.691]  Band.Video.
[01:58:53.332 --> 01:58:55.753]  Gregory Manarino is our guest for one more segment.
[01:58:55.953 --> 01:58:59.336]  Then, John Rappaport, investigative journalist, always very informative.
[01:59:00.196 --> 01:59:02.458]  And everything he's saying is totally true.
[01:59:03.158 --> 01:59:10.042]  I mean, I cut my teeth on Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan and Ron Paul, and all this stuff is on record true.
[01:59:10.143 --> 01:59:13.225]  I've checked the Federal Reserve Charter, all of it, never been audited.
[01:59:14.185 --> 01:59:15.146]  We're now a hundred and...
[01:59:16.724 --> 01:59:22.990]  Eight years into this monster, and it is a total dictatorship.
[01:59:23.010 --> 01:59:23.870]  They get to play God.
[01:59:24.811 --> 01:59:27.614]  And so we're talking about where this is going.
[01:59:27.634 --> 01:59:28.975]  Well, of course they're abusing their power.
[01:59:29.015 --> 01:59:31.197]  Now they have a technocracy to track everything we do.
[01:59:31.717 --> 01:59:33.979]  The big central banks are saying you're obsolete.
[01:59:34.019 --> 01:59:36.021]  They're saying you are non-essential.
[01:59:36.061 --> 01:59:41.105]  That's not just a Twilight Zone episode where he says, you are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:59:41.166 --> 01:59:41.966]  You are non-essential.
[01:59:42.006 --> 01:59:43.247]  They're actually doing it.
[01:59:44.108 --> 01:59:47.552]  And all these leftists think in a communist system you get all this free time, you lay around.
[01:59:47.592 --> 01:59:48.273]  No, you're a slave.
[01:59:48.853 --> 01:59:52.798]  And then some banker lives offshore and runs your communist country as a farm.
[01:59:53.659 --> 01:59:57.423]  Hell, the CFR brags that they set up China as a farm.
[01:59:57.643 --> 01:59:59.125]  I'm not against the great Chinese people.
[01:59:59.165 --> 02:00:01.708]  I'm against the Chinese communists run by the globalists.
[02:00:02.697 --> 02:00:05.279]  And so they're getting rid of our free market.
[02:00:05.299 --> 02:00:11.444]  They're getting rid of the little sliver of the peace that we could live off of, because it makes us too uppity.
[02:00:11.965 --> 02:00:16.008]  And Gregory, in the five, six minutes we have left, I really want to invite you back.
[02:00:17.987 --> 02:00:19.568]  Yes, the endgame has collapsed everything.
[02:00:19.628 --> 02:00:25.351]  Once they've made us non-essential, once they've gotten us on a universal income, then they collapse things even more to dictate.
[02:00:25.511 --> 02:00:31.114]  So give people where compliance, where submission goes, and then, hey, I love GameStop.
[02:00:31.594 --> 02:00:32.394]  I love AMC.
[02:00:32.454 --> 02:00:34.415]  I love propping up things the enemy wants to destroy.
[02:00:34.656 --> 02:00:35.796]  For me, it's not an investment.
[02:00:35.836 --> 02:00:36.617]  For me, it's war.
[02:00:37.077 --> 02:00:39.578]  But there are other ways to skin this cat, isn't there?
[02:00:41.259 --> 02:00:41.839]  Absolutely.
[02:00:42.039 --> 02:00:43.000]  And again, just
[02:00:43.647 --> 02:00:45.228]  Having an awareness of what's going on.
[02:00:45.268 --> 02:00:46.488]  What are they doing, Alex?
[02:00:46.788 --> 02:00:51.270]  They're trying desperately and they're succeeding in creating a slave society.
[02:00:51.571 --> 02:00:54.032]  A dependent slave society.
[02:00:54.492 --> 02:00:56.433]  Again, why are they doing what they're doing here?
[02:00:56.513 --> 02:00:58.754]  Why are they creating this 2-2 society?
[02:00:58.834 --> 02:01:00.494]  Why are they getting rid of the middle class?
[02:01:00.534 --> 02:01:01.495]  It's about control.
[02:01:02.273 --> 02:01:06.296]  They want to make the government get much larger and much more powerful.
[02:01:06.336 --> 02:01:19.345]  They want people dependent on the system, literally creating zombies, slaves that will bow down to a government, big government, a one world government.
[02:01:19.726 --> 02:01:21.707]  This is where we are going here.
[02:01:21.807 --> 02:01:26.871]  A new system, a new paradigm, a new dollar, a new mode of transaction.
[02:01:26.931 --> 02:01:31.094]  We are in the middle, in my view, of a massive shift.
[02:01:31.694 --> 02:01:36.978]  From one system to a completely new system.
[02:01:37.058 --> 02:01:37.758]  And what did they do?
[02:01:38.298 --> 02:01:46.484]  In order to finish the job, they had to do one thing, Alex, and that one thing was to shut down the global economy.
[02:01:46.904 --> 02:01:47.824]  That's the key.
[02:01:48.265 --> 02:01:52.848]  Doing this whole virus scandemic, however you want to look at it, I know you cover it a lot.
[02:01:53.848 --> 02:01:54.569]  That's the key.
[02:01:55.914 --> 02:01:56.955]  They got this out here.
[02:01:57.235 --> 02:02:00.258]  They got the mainstream media pushing their agenda.
[02:02:00.659 --> 02:02:02.241]  They got people afraid.
[02:02:02.461 --> 02:02:03.962]  They got people who can't act.
[02:02:04.183 --> 02:02:05.324]  They're making them paralyzed.
[02:02:05.344 --> 02:02:07.346]  They're making them dependent on the system.
[02:02:07.626 --> 02:02:09.488]  They're creating slaves, Alex.
[02:02:09.508 --> 02:02:10.610]  This is what they're doing.
[02:02:10.810 --> 02:02:11.711]  Guys like you and me,
[02:02:12.629 --> 02:02:15.090]  I would hope this doesn't happen, but they don't want us to talk.
[02:02:15.230 --> 02:02:16.630]  You know that better than anybody else.
[02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:17.691]  They want to shut us down.
[02:02:18.371 --> 02:02:21.052]  They don't want the truth out there, because the truth gives us power.
[02:02:21.552 --> 02:02:27.434]  And I want listeners to know, it's only that there are a few hundred people left on air, like Tucker Carlson, you, myself, others.
[02:02:27.794 --> 02:02:28.814]  Limbaugh's dying of cancer.
[02:02:28.835 --> 02:02:29.915]  He's not perfect, but he's a good guy.
[02:02:31.355 --> 02:02:34.776]  When they feel like they've got everybody covered, they're going to go even crazier.
[02:02:34.817 --> 02:02:37.337]  They admit that they want to depopulate the planet.
[02:02:37.818 --> 02:02:38.738]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:02:39.534 --> 02:02:42.116]  Well, this is how it's going to get set up, Alex.
[02:02:42.176 --> 02:02:42.737]  I can tell you.
[02:02:42.777 --> 02:02:43.377]  What are they doing?
[02:02:43.417 --> 02:02:48.942]  They're using the financial markets right now to create a massive wealth transfer effect, and it's always the same thing.
[02:02:49.262 --> 02:02:53.426]  We know what they're going to do because we've seen this game before, but never to this degree.
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:03:11.807]  Central Banks, the Federal Reserve, has hyperinflated a bubble in debt on a scale and magnitude that even me, and I study this stuff around the clock 24-7, I can't even get my head around it's so big, that debt bubble has inflated a massive bubble in the stock market and a massive bubble in housing.
[02:03:11.847 --> 02:03:16.669]  What they're going to do at a time of their choosing is allow the debt bubble to burst.
[02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:22.051]  When the debt bubble bursts, Alex, there's going to be pandemonium in the streets.
[02:03:22.091 --> 02:03:22.831]  What are they trying to do?
[02:03:23.271 --> 02:03:29.920]  Why is the Federal Reserve right now involved in a money printing digital assets extravagance?
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:31.862]  While funding Black Lives Matter.
[02:03:31.922 --> 02:03:38.751]  When there's an economic collapse, which is in the IMF World Bank document, they do this on purpose in third world countries, they'll cause a race war as the cover for what they're doing.
[02:03:39.724 --> 02:03:44.567]  Well, of course, they'll do it, of course, to keep the distraction off of what they are doing here.
[02:03:44.948 --> 02:03:53.954]  So what's going to end up happening again by design is they're trying to prevent the financial system right now from locking up something called a credit freeze.
[02:03:54.254 --> 02:03:56.676]  When the system just stops, there's no cash in the bank.
[02:03:56.756 --> 02:03:57.696]  Nothing can be had.
[02:03:58.017 --> 02:03:59.738]  This is why the Fed is doing what they're doing.
[02:03:59.758 --> 02:04:05.422]  They're buying it all by design in order to allow a monumental
[02:04:06.122 --> 02:04:06.603]  I don't
[02:04:21.895 --> 02:04:24.097]  Get together with like-minded people.
[02:04:24.577 --> 02:04:26.318]  Pay attention to shows like yours.
[02:04:26.619 --> 02:04:28.080]  Shows like mine.
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:29.901]  Understand what's going on.
[02:04:29.921 --> 02:04:30.722]  Raise your awareness.
[02:04:30.742 --> 02:04:33.724]  By the way, Gregory, I want to invite you back next week for two hours.
[02:04:33.744 --> 02:04:34.344]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:34.384 --> 02:04:37.807]  My gut is, my gut's never wrong, is get to the countryside.
[02:04:38.227 --> 02:04:39.368]  Get with normal people.
[02:04:39.448 --> 02:04:40.229]  Get a water well.
[02:04:40.649 --> 02:04:42.551]  Grow food, have storable food, get ready.
[02:04:42.571 --> 02:04:43.773]  I mean, my gut's never wrong.
[02:04:44.153 --> 02:04:45.354]  It tells me hell's coming.
[02:04:45.715 --> 02:04:53.504]  And I don't want to get up here and scare listeners and people, but I mean, I can look at this control breakdown, how they're getting everybody ready to knock them over like an old barn in a tornado.
[02:04:53.884 --> 02:04:56.848]  I mean, my gut is just, buddy, you better get close to the ground right now.
[02:04:58.143 --> 02:04:58.944]  A hundred percent.
[02:04:59.244 --> 02:05:02.746]  Look, this is all by design.
[02:05:03.147 --> 02:05:05.228]  Nothing we're seeing is by accident.
[02:05:05.268 --> 02:05:06.309]  People don't understand.
[02:05:06.329 --> 02:05:07.890]  They want you gone.
[02:05:08.711 --> 02:05:09.852]  They want control.
[02:05:10.172 --> 02:05:11.453]  It's all about control.
[02:05:11.513 --> 02:05:17.337]  It's about creating a new society, a completely new set of rules, and it's getting written right before our face.
[02:05:17.377 --> 02:05:19.018]  They got us locked up in our houses.
[02:05:19.379 --> 02:05:19.779]  Why?
[02:05:20.019 --> 02:05:20.940]  They don't want us together.
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:21.961]  They don't want us conversing.
[02:05:22.001 --> 02:05:23.522]  They don't want the truth getting out there.
[02:05:23.742 --> 02:05:26.144]  They want people afraid, paralyzed, not to act.
[02:05:26.984 --> 02:05:32.408]  What they're doing, all of this is a PSYOP on a scale that is, again, unbelievable.
[02:05:32.448 --> 02:05:34.790]  Because a foreign army, we would rally and fight.
[02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:37.652]  But if it's economic and it's cultural, what do we do?
[02:05:37.773 --> 02:05:39.654]  All right, I'm impressed, Gregory Marino.
[02:05:40.014 --> 02:05:41.856]  I really appreciate you coming on the show.
[02:05:42.256 --> 02:05:45.158]  TradersChoice.net, Gregory Manarino.
[02:05:46.039 --> 02:05:47.260]  Where else can people find your work?
[02:05:48.513 --> 02:05:52.916]  Well, you know, I do a YouTube blog twice a day, but everything you want to find is on my YouTube.
[02:05:52.936 --> 02:05:56.098]  I'm sorry, on my website right there, TradersChoice.net.
[02:05:56.398 --> 02:05:57.699]  We've got to get the word out.
[02:05:58.079 --> 02:06:03.102]  You know, look, sometimes I feel defeated and I'm so thankful to be on your show here, Alex.
[02:06:03.202 --> 02:06:08.046]  Honestly, we've got to let people understand what's really happening.
[02:06:08.386 --> 02:06:09.286]  Pay attention, people.
[02:06:09.386 --> 02:06:10.187]  Raise your
[02:06:10.547 --> 02:06:10.827]  I agree.
[02:06:10.847 --> 02:06:12.088]  Hey, come back on Owen's show.
[02:06:12.148 --> 02:06:14.069]  Come back on The Morning Show anytime you got time.
[02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:15.929]  Come back on American Journal.
[02:06:15.949 --> 02:06:17.090]  We really appreciate what you said.
[02:06:17.110 --> 02:06:19.291]  It was 100% that on, and it added a lot of context.
[02:06:19.311 --> 02:06:19.791]  God bless you.
[02:06:20.832 --> 02:06:21.232]  You, too.
[02:06:21.572 --> 02:06:21.832]  Good deal.
[02:06:21.932 --> 02:06:22.252]  All right.
[02:06:22.912 --> 02:06:24.933]  Gregory Manorino, TraderChoice.net.
[02:06:24.993 --> 02:06:25.814]  Amazing information.
[02:06:25.834 --> 02:06:26.134]  All right.
[02:06:27.509 --> 02:06:31.530]  I'm going to try to hand the baton to Jon Rappaport coming up, and I'll just tell you this.
[02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:32.410]  It's point blank.
[02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:33.731]  I was in there with accounting this morning.
[02:06:33.751 --> 02:06:36.111]  They're like, yeah, you got us into the black the last three months.
[02:06:36.511 --> 02:06:37.272]  We're barely in the black.
[02:06:37.292 --> 02:06:38.792]  We got an extra month of operating capital.
[02:06:38.812 --> 02:06:39.852]  We need to get in there, Jones.
[02:06:40.813 --> 02:06:42.993]  And you need to sell products so we can stay on the air.
[02:06:43.073 --> 02:06:44.554]  So these are great products you already need.
[02:06:45.714 --> 02:06:47.895]  And it funds this operation to keep us on air.
[02:06:47.935 --> 02:06:49.055]  We've proven we're for real.
[02:06:49.335 --> 02:06:50.675]  We're proven we're hardcore.
[02:06:50.875 --> 02:06:52.236]  We've proven we don't back down.
[02:06:52.696 --> 02:06:56.017]  And so I just ask you, support our local radio stations, support local TV stations.
[02:06:56.037 --> 02:06:56.577]  They're amazing.
[02:06:57.850 --> 02:06:59.491]  And buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:07:00.572 --> 02:07:05.235]  There's nothing better you can do for yourself than Ultra 12 High Quality Concentrated Vitamin B12.
[02:07:05.275 --> 02:07:06.897]  So good for your immune system, your whole body.
[02:07:06.917 --> 02:07:07.577]  It's a building block.
[02:07:08.718 --> 02:07:08.858]  50% off.
[02:07:08.898 --> 02:07:09.599]  It was sold out.
[02:07:09.699 --> 02:07:10.639]  It's now back in stock.
[02:07:10.659 --> 02:07:11.900]  It was barely sold out for like two weeks.
[02:07:12.341 --> 02:07:13.341]  But it's 50% off.
[02:07:13.762 --> 02:07:14.782]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:07:14.802 --> 02:07:15.543]  Take it under the tongue.
[02:07:15.583 --> 02:07:16.464]  You get great absorption.
[02:07:16.784 --> 02:07:19.446]  DNA Force Plus is very expensive for us to make.
[02:07:19.826 --> 02:07:24.570]  High quality, real PQQ, real CoQ10, real stuff in your telomeres, your cells.
[02:07:25.390 --> 02:07:26.010]  It's selling out.
[02:07:26.030 --> 02:07:30.152]  25% off lung cleanse with all the essential oils for your throat, your mouth.
[02:07:30.212 --> 02:07:33.333]  It goes down into your esophagus, into your bronchioles.
[02:07:33.393 --> 02:07:33.913]  It's so good.
[02:07:35.213 --> 02:07:36.034]  Got a new shipment of that.
[02:07:36.054 --> 02:07:37.134]  50% off.
[02:07:37.154 --> 02:07:38.874]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:07:38.894 --> 02:07:40.115]  Info War Store.
[02:07:42.066 --> 02:07:48.911]  .com or 888-253-3139 and I just want to be able to stay on the air, into the future and watch this unfold.
[02:07:49.051 --> 02:07:58.177]  I don't want to be there when they cut us off because, let me tell you, nobody, and I'm not bragging because we're still, the enemy could kill me tomorrow, but nobody put tentacles into the ground like we did.
[02:07:58.477 --> 02:08:02.881]  You know, a tree's got to reach into hell with its roots for that its branches can reach to heaven.
[02:08:03.181 --> 02:08:04.782]  Well, I got my roots in it.
[02:08:05.022 --> 02:08:06.003]  Roots deep in the earth.
[02:08:06.223 --> 02:08:07.123]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:08:08.044 --> 02:08:10.350]  We've got our own systems and our own everything.
[02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:11.212]  I'm going to get into it all.
[02:08:11.292 --> 02:08:12.636]  We got the infrastructure here.
[02:08:13.398 --> 02:08:13.839]  Just probably.
[02:08:16.062 --> 02:08:19.064]  $20 million of equipment sitting there, not to mention all the costs for it.
[02:08:19.584 --> 02:08:22.065]  And I mean, nobody's got this stuff except major networks.
[02:08:22.725 --> 02:08:24.426]  And we did it because we knew this was coming.
[02:08:24.466 --> 02:08:25.086]  Thank God.
[02:08:25.667 --> 02:08:27.508]  God inspired us to make the right decisions.
[02:08:27.548 --> 02:08:30.769]  But they're going to shut everything down when they make their move.
[02:08:30.909 --> 02:08:32.090]  I mean, you think Trump was bad?
[02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:33.090]  He was just the beta test.
[02:08:33.350 --> 02:08:35.732]  They're shutting everything down, but they're operatives.
[02:08:36.232 --> 02:08:37.953]  Only the left will be allowed to operate.
[02:08:38.093 --> 02:08:42.435]  Only communists, only fascists, only authoritarians, only pedophiles, only devil worshipers.
[02:08:42.935 --> 02:08:51.321]  But we're so great, thanks to God and our great stations, we have hundreds of radio stations, hundreds of cable and TV stations that all have their own streams and stuff.
[02:08:51.621 --> 02:08:56.965]  So as long as we have uplinks, I'll just let the enemy know, I've already built alternative backup uplinks, bastards.
[02:08:57.405 --> 02:08:59.087]  We've already built whole new stuff.
[02:09:00.368 --> 02:09:02.769]  So we won't be as easy to kill as you want us to be.
[02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:06.332]  And we're building more stuff so you can burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:09:08.273 --> 02:09:09.774]  John Rappaport, straight ahead.
[02:09:10.755 --> 02:09:11.856]  John Rappaport here.
[02:09:13.362 --> 02:09:23.404]  This hour, InfoWars, a bunch of stories that we need to cover here and I want to start with one that I talked about last week.
[02:09:24.564 --> 02:09:41.768]  Got to keep punching this up because it's very important and it's one of these stories where everybody can chip in because it's the amount of coverage and perception that matters and it has to do with by
[02:09:42.668 --> 02:09:49.612]  It has to do with the condition of Biden, the physical condition, the mental condition.
[02:09:50.213 --> 02:10:08.483]  As I mentioned last week at length, during the campaign, presidential campaign, the media were completely silent about the obvious fact that this candidate was in severe mental decline.
[02:10:09.484 --> 02:10:11.005]  It wasn't a matter of opinion.
[02:10:11.986 --> 02:10:14.507]  Or, well, you're looking at it from a skewed angle.
[02:10:14.947 --> 02:10:15.147]  No.
[02:10:16.068 --> 02:10:16.768]  It was clear.
[02:10:16.948 --> 02:10:21.630]  And there are many examples, and you can find them on video, to prove this.
[02:10:23.651 --> 02:10:24.911]  It's not just stuttering.
[02:10:24.991 --> 02:10:26.212]  It's not just stammering.
[02:10:26.792 --> 02:10:28.713]  It's loss of memory.
[02:10:29.433 --> 02:10:30.393]  Where are we?
[02:10:30.674 --> 02:10:31.634]  It's the tremors.
[02:10:31.914 --> 02:10:36.976]  It's the hypervigilance toward teleprompter.
[02:10:37.156 --> 02:10:40.057]  It's what he's saying when he goes off script.
[02:10:41.298 --> 02:10:41.438]  It's
[02:10:42.125 --> 02:10:44.787]  His mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
[02:10:46.308 --> 02:10:57.174]  And the medical history which has been documented, that in 1988, he had a brain aneurysm, which required surgery.
[02:10:57.615 --> 02:10:58.575]  Very serious.
[02:11:00.436 --> 02:11:01.857]  Two surgeries, in fact.
[02:11:02.658 --> 02:11:06.540]  And then pulmonary thrombosis, which was even more serious.
[02:11:07.781 --> 02:11:08.561]  Life-threatening.
[02:11:10.202 --> 02:11:11.003]  And since then,
[02:11:11.738 --> 02:11:14.219]  There has been a mental decline.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:24.223]  So we have a disabled person sitting in the Oval Office as President of the United States.
[02:11:25.043 --> 02:11:29.025]  Not just a little bit off, but severely disabled.
[02:11:30.445 --> 02:11:36.268]  And obviously the press was under tight control, tight restriction during the campaign.
[02:11:36.408 --> 02:11:39.829]  And still, not to mention this, not to bring it up,
[02:11:41.021 --> 02:11:43.982]  Not to report on it, not to point it out.
[02:11:45.262 --> 02:12:04.007]  You can find videos from his early career, because he's been in the Senate forever, when he used to be on the talk shows, Sunday morning talk shows, and he was slick Joe, very quick, very fast, whether you agreed with any of his opinions or not besides a point.
[02:12:04.724 --> 02:12:07.426]  Question, answer, at length and detail.
[02:12:07.786 --> 02:12:09.247]  Bing, bang, bong, bong, bong.
[02:12:09.367 --> 02:12:13.050]  And now, if you're watching, you see the picture on the screen.
[02:12:13.591 --> 02:12:15.012]  It's a completely different person.
[02:12:17.333 --> 02:12:20.035]  You can put these side-by-side videos out there.
[02:12:20.776 --> 02:12:34.006]  You can also mention the fact that after Trump became president, perhaps a year into his term, all of a sudden you saw a psychiatrist, remember?
[02:12:34.833 --> 02:12:38.416]  Doing remote diagnoses on Trump at a distance?
[02:12:39.437 --> 02:12:41.218]  Saying that he was mentally ill?
[02:12:41.758 --> 02:12:43.780]  Suffering from mental disorders?
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:53.827]  I mean, violating all of the ethics and whatever rules actually exist in that completely fake profession of psychiatry?
[02:12:54.668 --> 02:12:58.511]  And just making diagnoses over and over again?
[02:12:59.232 --> 02:13:02.334]  But did you see any astute doctor?
[02:13:03.328 --> 02:13:13.131]  Coming forward during the presidential campaign, saying anything about Biden who had access to major media talk shows or news reports?
[02:13:13.692 --> 02:13:14.612]  Absolutely not.
[02:13:16.233 --> 02:13:19.394]  This is very serious business.
[02:13:20.374 --> 02:13:28.637]  Do I have to repeat the fact that this is a guy who looks at the nuclear football and decides whether to launch missiles or not?
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:33.383]  That this guy is being controlled by a committee and he's a puppet?
[02:13:34.464 --> 02:13:39.448]  As we come up to the break here, keep in mind you can do something about this.
[02:13:39.528 --> 02:13:42.870]  You can make this point and drive it home.
[02:13:43.731 --> 02:13:44.371]  Stay with us.
[02:13:45.452 --> 02:13:47.614]  John Rappaport back here in the next segment.
[02:13:47.634 --> 02:13:50.636]  So I'll just wind up what I was saying before the break.
[02:13:51.597 --> 02:13:53.298]  You can do something about this.
[02:13:54.799 --> 02:13:58.162]  If we were to suddenly see on various platforms
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:14.391]  100,000 postings of side by side before and after the brain aneurysm of Biden and the various videos of his obviously disabled state now.
[02:14:16.552 --> 02:14:27.701]  Uncompromisingly pointing to the fact that this is a man who has such severe mental and motor deficits that there is no way
[02:14:28.331 --> 02:14:31.353]  Medically speaking, that he should be in the White House.
[02:14:31.753 --> 02:14:33.815]  Doesn't matter which side you're on.
[02:14:34.315 --> 02:14:35.176]  It's just a fact.
[02:14:37.177 --> 02:14:42.861]  Okay, so now I want to get to another story here on the COVID death numbers.
[02:14:44.141 --> 02:14:48.905]  I reported on this before, but I found a new source for statistics.
[02:14:50.646 --> 02:14:55.409]  It's actually Statista.com and
[02:14:56.328 --> 02:14:58.750]  This would be recent.
[02:15:00.912 --> 02:15:11.341]  This is going official stats here, which are certainly not reliable by any means for a variety of reasons I've explained before on the show.
[02:15:12.082 --> 02:15:17.366]  But we're going to take that as the, you know, starting point here.
[02:15:18.868 --> 02:15:21.390]  So at the point of the Statista report,
[02:15:23.655 --> 02:15:24.615]  There were 359,352 deaths in the U.S.
[02:15:24.675 --> 02:15:25.235]  from COVID.
[02:15:25.255 --> 02:15:32.878]  If you were to take the percentage of deaths in people 65 years and older, get this, it would be 81%.
[02:15:32.918 --> 02:15:35.418]  81% of all COVID deaths in the U.S.
[02:15:35.438 --> 02:15:37.339]  in 65 years and older.
[02:15:53.522 --> 02:15:59.025]  And if you don't see immediately the significance of that, I'll explain it in a minute.
[02:15:59.945 --> 02:16:19.595]  If you were to go back and say, well, let's look at 55 and older, what percentage of deaths, COVID deaths in the U.S., 93% of all COVID deaths in the U.S., 55 years and old.
[02:16:21.796 --> 02:16:23.097]  That is unbelievable.
[02:16:25.512 --> 02:16:28.534]  And here's why, exactly as I've explained before.
[02:16:30.776 --> 02:16:43.145]  First of all, overwhelmingly, most of these people have prior medical histories of multiple long-term serious health conditions.
[02:16:44.786 --> 02:16:51.611]  On top of that, they've been treated for years, perhaps decades, with toxic medical drugs.
[02:16:52.632 --> 02:16:54.914]  Not just one or two, but
[02:16:55.785 --> 02:16:58.766]  A variety of toxic medical drugs.
[02:17:00.407 --> 02:17:11.431]  Number three, the people in this older population tend to be terrified by the possibility that they're going to get a diagnosis of COVID-19.
[02:17:13.412 --> 02:17:22.116]  And then they do get a diagnosis of COVID-19, which ratchets up their terror.
[02:17:22.716 --> 02:17:24.697]  And then on top of all of this,
[02:17:25.785 --> 02:17:31.448]  They are quarantined, isolated, and cut off from friends and family.
[02:17:33.289 --> 02:17:37.471]  Whether that's in a nursing home, a hospital, or at home.
[02:17:39.492 --> 02:17:40.172]  Wherever they live.
[02:17:42.153 --> 02:17:44.614]  And one final stroke.
[02:17:46.655 --> 02:17:51.998]  Some of them are then heavily sedated and put on breathing ventilators.
[02:17:53.544 --> 02:18:12.553]  And in a large New York study of a hospital chain in New York State, it was determined that for people 65 years and older who were put on ventilators as treatment, 97.2% of those people died under ventilator treatment.
[02:18:14.094 --> 02:18:21.698]  That's why I've posted my articles in the past that say Soylent Green is people, COVID-19 is old people.
[02:18:22.677 --> 02:18:24.638]  That's where the deaths are occurring.
[02:18:25.198 --> 02:18:35.082]  And notice that in my analysis over the last two, three minutes here, I've mentioned nothing about a virus, nothing about SARS-CoV-2.
[02:18:36.022 --> 02:18:47.366]  No need for a virus, no requirement of a virus to explain any of these deaths in this older population, of which 81% occur in the group
[02:18:51.226 --> 02:18:56.130]  65 and older and 93% in the population 55 and older.
[02:18:57.571 --> 02:19:00.012]  Talk about killing.
[02:19:01.353 --> 02:19:07.217]  The forced early premature deaths of the frail and elderly.
[02:19:07.337 --> 02:19:09.298]  That's what is going on.
[02:19:10.018 --> 02:19:13.301]  That is the key operation called COVID-19.
[02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:16.663]  Not anything else.
[02:19:19.905 --> 02:19:20.105]  So,
[02:19:22.233 --> 02:19:28.957]  No virus required to explain these deaths.
[02:19:29.417 --> 02:19:33.259]  81%, 93% of all reports in the U.S.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:40.082]  That's a crime of unimaginable proportions.
[02:19:41.903 --> 02:19:43.944]  Mass murder is what it is.
[02:19:46.406 --> 02:19:50.408]  And it's being completely overlooked, of course, by the government, by the press.
[02:19:51.624 --> 02:20:11.919]  By the political left, by all those people who want the COVID restrictions and the destruction of the economy, because those COVID death numbers are part of what's being used to explain and justify and provoke all of these restricted
[02:20:12.594 --> 02:20:41.527]  Restrictive COVID measures, including masks, distancing, and most important, the lockdowns, the closures of businesses, the destruction of workers' lives, families, the economy, not just of the U.S., but of nations all over the world, as the prelude to the Great Reset, which I've also discussed and described on the show, as certainly has Alex and other people
[02:20:46.753 --> 02:20:59.483]  So this is the operation, the killing of the elderly, to leverage into the operation of the destruction of the economy through COVID restrictive measures.
[02:21:00.905 --> 02:21:02.966]  Killing of the elderly.
[02:21:04.607 --> 02:21:05.708]  That's what's going on.
[02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:14.996]  But the nation and the world, for the most part, has been hypnotized over the last hundred years.
[02:21:16.328 --> 02:21:19.650]  By the, primarily, the Rockefeller empire.
[02:21:22.713 --> 02:21:24.694]  To say, well, you're the doctor.
[02:21:25.715 --> 02:21:26.816]  You know what's best.
[02:21:27.036 --> 02:21:28.397]  Whatever you say, doc.
[02:21:30.919 --> 02:21:45.389]  And you will find that even people who might disobey doctor's orders or not seek out a doctor for treatment will finally give in because of pressure.
[02:21:46.121 --> 02:21:49.182]  Peer pressure from friends, from family, from loved ones.
[02:21:49.202 --> 02:21:50.242]  You've got to see the doctor.
[02:21:50.302 --> 02:21:51.283]  You've got to go to the doctor.
[02:21:51.703 --> 02:21:53.424]  You've got to listen to what the doctor says.
[02:21:53.984 --> 02:22:05.748]  So if the doctor says there's a pandemic, an epidemic, those of you watching are looking at Fauci, who flip-flops every other week, that's hypnotic.
[02:22:06.928 --> 02:22:08.249]  It's what the doctor says.
[02:22:08.349 --> 02:22:11.610]  If the doctor says, virus, virus, virus, that's what it is.
[02:22:14.232 --> 02:22:20.994]  I've been warning since 1987 that the medical cartel is the most powerful cartel in the world long term.
[02:22:23.794 --> 02:22:31.736]  Because of this century, at least, of wall-to-wall brainwashing on their part.
[02:22:33.637 --> 02:22:36.897]  And now it's all coming to fruition for them.
[02:22:37.638 --> 02:22:40.478]  Because they can now say pandemic, pandemic, pandemic.
[02:22:41.218 --> 02:22:43.279]  And so people overlook the fact
[02:22:43.973 --> 02:22:58.560]  That the elderly whom they know, who might be in their own families, are actually being forced in exactly the manner that I just described into early death, and their deaths will be counted as COVID deaths.
[02:22:59.021 --> 02:23:07.505]  And I'm not even talking about those deaths in which flippantly doctors write COVID-19 as the cause on the patient files.
[02:23:07.965 --> 02:23:11.407]  I'm not even talking about that, which is rampant as well.
[02:23:12.972 --> 02:23:18.096]  I'm talking about something that is much more sinister and real and happening all the time.
[02:23:20.478 --> 02:23:22.199]  That is what is going on.
[02:23:22.779 --> 02:23:31.626]  And that is why looking into these death numbers, which I just did, the 81% and the 93%, is so important to understand.
[02:23:32.166 --> 02:23:33.387]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:23:33.908 --> 02:23:36.890]  John Rappaport here for the next segment on InfoWars.
[02:23:40.452 --> 02:23:42.434]  Okay, I want to remind you of something.
[02:23:43.806 --> 02:23:49.351]  In case you've forgotten or you missed it, and that has to do with the diagnosis of COVID-19.
[02:23:51.613 --> 02:23:58.319]  A cough or chills and fever, and a person could be diagnosed with COVID-19.
[02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:00.862]  That's it.
[02:24:02.283 --> 02:24:08.449]  Now, if you read the CDC definition, they'll say, and a positive PCR test.
[02:24:09.301 --> 02:24:21.644]  But as I've described in agonizing detail on the show before and written about in many articles, that test spits out false positives like a fire hose for various reasons.
[02:24:22.684 --> 02:24:28.006]  And so it's very easy to come up with a positive reading on a PCR test.
[02:24:30.846 --> 02:24:35.507]  And then with a cough or chills and fever, COVID-19.
[02:24:35.667 --> 02:24:38.068]  So people wonder, well, is it possible?
[02:24:38.894 --> 02:24:43.796]  That they're repackaging flu as COVID-19?
[02:24:44.757 --> 02:24:45.417]  Possible?
[02:24:46.518 --> 02:24:47.318]  Are you kidding me?
[02:24:48.899 --> 02:24:50.399]  It's obviously going on.
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:25:02.125]  Now we're talking about case numbers where they say, oh, there's, you know, 17 million of these and those and whatever cases.
[02:25:05.946 --> 02:25:06.987]  That's the firehose.
[02:25:07.717 --> 02:25:23.832]  That's like, well, the guy has symptoms that are really no different than a light cold or easy cases of what we used to call the flu, but a positive PCR test and looking, yeah, okay, let's call it COVID-19.
[02:25:26.914 --> 02:25:33.060]  And then the hysterical coverage on the news when they start showing you the clock and the
[02:25:34.029 --> 02:25:40.371]  We've got another 100,000 more cases and 200,000 more cases and whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[02:25:43.271 --> 02:25:44.352]  That's what's going on.
[02:25:46.172 --> 02:25:52.834]  Then, of course, with the, quote, heavier cases of COVID-19, you would get something like pneumonia.
[02:25:54.094 --> 02:25:54.714]  Gee whiz.
[02:25:54.794 --> 02:26:03.276]  But the trouble again, you see, is what's called pneumonia has many, many different causes.
[02:26:03.956 --> 02:26:04.416]  Historic.
[02:26:05.917 --> 02:26:11.220]  And there are millions of cases of pneumonia traditionally across the world every year.
[02:26:13.041 --> 02:26:14.042]  And always have been.
[02:26:14.963 --> 02:26:17.304]  Before anybody thought of COVID-19.
[02:26:18.485 --> 02:26:26.890]  So to say, well, we've got pneumonia over here, but we've got COVID pneumonia over there, it doesn't apply.
[02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:27.670]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:29.692 --> 02:26:33.574]  That distinction is a distinction without a difference.
[02:26:35.109 --> 02:26:35.829]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:37.290 --> 02:26:43.173]  But, it's a good con if you want to believe the numbers that the news is spouting.
[02:26:45.114 --> 02:26:47.215]  And that's what's going on with that.
[02:26:47.875 --> 02:26:56.740]  In fact, in China, roughly 300,000 people a year die from pneumonia traditionally, which means millions of cases.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:01.182]  So, in whatever it was, December of 2019, January of 2020,
[02:27:04.304 --> 02:27:15.479]  When they suddenly began reporting an outbreak of mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan, they were basically talking about something that happened all the time in China.
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:16.521]  Pneumonia.
[02:27:17.458 --> 02:27:24.863]  Only now they decided to compartmentalize it off and make a big deal out of it and say, well, this is different.
[02:27:24.903 --> 02:27:25.643]  This is strange.
[02:27:25.663 --> 02:27:26.144]  This is weird.
[02:27:26.164 --> 02:27:26.384]  This.
[02:27:27.044 --> 02:27:28.665]  Oh, we have to get the experts in here.
[02:27:28.805 --> 02:27:30.026]  Oh, we have to find a virus.
[02:27:30.106 --> 02:27:30.787]  Oh, there it is.
[02:27:31.467 --> 02:27:32.848]  Oh, we're going to call it SARS-CoV-2.
[02:27:32.968 --> 02:27:33.928]  Oh, here we go.
[02:27:34.149 --> 02:27:35.850]  Oh, spreading across the world.
[02:27:35.910 --> 02:27:37.271]  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
[02:27:38.631 --> 02:27:44.195]  When in fact, over the city of Wuhan and other major cities, as I reported before,
[02:27:44.994 --> 02:28:03.298]  There is constantly deadly, deadly air pollution composed of ingredients in a mixture that has never been observed before, has never existed before in human history from both early and modern industrial eras.
[02:28:06.419 --> 02:28:06.819]  Hello?
[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:13.361]  You know, there's the obvious explanation for the cases of pneumonia.
[02:28:13.956 --> 02:28:30.126]  But that doesn't create the fear of the pandemic, of the publicity, the government stepping in, the Chinese government locking down, that all the other governments following suit with the Chinese model, doesn't create any of that at all.
[02:28:30.767 --> 02:28:33.408]  So the planners had to go a different way.
[02:28:34.149 --> 02:28:37.351]  They had to say, this is unique, this is new, this is different.
[02:28:37.751 --> 02:28:42.074]  Now we have a killer virus and it's spreading all over the world and we have to lock everybody down.
[02:28:43.271 --> 02:28:47.012]  We have to destroy the economy of the planet in the process.
[02:28:48.272 --> 02:28:50.432]  And we can never return to the old days.
[02:28:50.452 --> 02:28:58.354]  We're going to have to enter the normal with the Great Reset and Universal Guaranteed Income and wall-to-wall surveillance in real time.
[02:28:58.994 --> 02:29:03.255]  And your behavior is linked to Universal Guaranteed Income.
[02:29:03.715 --> 02:29:08.936]  You'll receive a check every month if you behave, but if you vary from prescribed behavior,
[02:29:09.557 --> 02:29:14.740]  Your money will be cut or eliminated altogether and you'll be out on the street and you'll starve to death.
[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:28.607]  And if you want to go to work for a major corporation or travel, you're going to have to get vaccinated with an experimental vaccine that's never been tried on the public before because it's been too dangerous with a technology called RNA.
[02:29:31.549 --> 02:29:31.849]  Get it?
[02:29:34.590 --> 02:29:36.051]  That's the progression, folks.
[02:29:36.651 --> 02:29:37.752]  That's how it was built.
[02:29:38.206 --> 02:29:39.267]  That's where it leads.
[02:29:39.427 --> 02:29:40.468]  That's where it goes.
[02:29:41.548 --> 02:29:54.057]  It's no accident that you've now got the CEO of United Airlines falling on the heels of the Qantas CEO a couple of months ago saying, Oh, yes.
[02:29:56.118 --> 02:29:59.100]  You're going to need proof of vaccination if you want to travel.
[02:30:01.682 --> 02:30:01.842]  And
[02:30:02.810 --> 02:30:14.912]  This CEO is now openly enlisting the cooperation of other CEOs of major corporations to climb on board with this mandate for a vaccine.
[02:30:16.232 --> 02:30:18.773]  He is openly saying, I can't do this alone.
[02:30:19.673 --> 02:30:28.074]  Hey, United Airlines is not going to stand alone in all of this because then we won't win the battle to mandate the vaccine.
[02:30:30.735 --> 02:30:30.915]  So,
[02:30:31.687 --> 02:30:32.988]  What's not being said here?
[02:30:33.768 --> 02:30:50.477]  What's not being said is that the federal government is putting pressure on these corporations to handle the mandates because it's not easy to get a federal mandate to vaccinate everybody against COVID in the U.S.
[02:30:51.758 --> 02:30:53.159]  It's not easy.
[02:30:53.739 --> 02:30:56.661]  It will run into many, many obstacles.
[02:30:58.241 --> 02:31:01.063]  Even if a law were passed at the federal level,
[02:31:01.713 --> 02:31:04.854]  There would be many constitutional and legal challenges.
[02:31:04.934 --> 02:31:07.514]  You can bet your bottom dollar on that.
[02:31:08.214 --> 02:31:14.996]  So, at least for the moment, it's up to the states and major corporations.
[02:31:15.956 --> 02:31:26.398]  That's why this guy is appearing now, the CEO of United Airlines, because what's the first thing people think of when they think of the lifting of restrictions?
[02:31:27.168 --> 02:31:33.335]  Well, they certainly think of going outside and going back to work, yes, but the next thing is travel.
[02:31:33.375 --> 02:31:34.136]  I want to travel.
[02:31:34.176 --> 02:31:35.238]  I want to go places.
[02:31:35.338 --> 02:31:36.459]  I want to see things.
[02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:38.942]  I want to visit family and so forth.
[02:31:39.503 --> 02:31:44.749]  Yes, we understand we who are controlling you, so therefore we say,
[02:31:45.549 --> 02:31:50.050]  Hey, if you want to travel, you gotta get the vaccine.
[02:31:50.650 --> 02:31:54.091]  If you want to travel, you gotta get the vaccine.
[02:31:54.691 --> 02:31:55.351]  Uh-huh-huh.
[02:31:55.411 --> 02:31:55.931]  You get it?
[02:31:56.011 --> 02:31:56.452]  You get it?
[02:31:56.512 --> 02:31:56.932]  You get it?
[02:31:57.352 --> 02:32:01.093]  If you want to live a normal life, you gotta get the vaccine.
[02:32:02.413 --> 02:32:03.273]  That's what's happening.
[02:32:04.974 --> 02:32:05.514]  Stay with us.
[02:32:05.594 --> 02:32:07.954]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:32:09.295 --> 02:32:11.655]  John Rappaport back here on InfoWars.
[02:32:13.696 --> 02:32:15.116]  So I was talking about travel.
[02:32:16.007 --> 02:32:25.975]  And the airlines, of course, leading the way by saying, well, if you want to travel, and everybody does, got to get the vaccine, got to get the vaccine, got to get the vaccine.
[02:32:26.956 --> 02:32:34.982]  What about all those nurses that you've been hearing and reading about around the country that are refusing the vaccine?
[02:32:36.844 --> 02:32:38.585]  I guess they're not going to fly, right?
[02:32:41.207 --> 02:32:41.888]  Think about that.
[02:32:42.909 --> 02:32:44.490]  I guess they're willing not to fly.
[02:32:47.418 --> 02:32:50.319]  Which amounts to a boycott.
[02:32:51.459 --> 02:32:53.319]  At least, that's the way it looks, isn't it?
[02:32:55.040 --> 02:33:04.902]  And well, if you say we have to get the vaccine in order to fly, then I guess we won't fly.
[02:33:04.922 --> 02:33:16.245]  Now, if the numbers of people who are turning down the vaccine get large enough, hmm,
[02:33:17.213 --> 02:33:17.813]  What happens?
[02:33:20.494 --> 02:33:23.275]  I don't know how the airlines are going to survive.
[02:33:25.336 --> 02:33:27.257]  They think they're in the position of control.
[02:33:27.797 --> 02:33:32.039]  Well, we control you because, you see, if you don't get the vaccine, you can't travel.
[02:33:32.119 --> 02:33:35.640]  Okay, well, guess who won't travel by air?
[02:33:38.081 --> 02:33:38.581]  Guess not.
[02:33:41.522 --> 02:33:42.763]  Does that amount to a boycott?
[02:33:42.783 --> 02:33:44.823]  Well, it sounds like a boycott.
[02:33:45.544 --> 02:33:46.304]  It may not be.
[02:33:47.150 --> 02:33:47.790]  Direct.
[02:33:49.151 --> 02:34:00.576]  But if they start dictating conditions and you don't want to go along with the conditions, it's like somebody saying, well, we're selling you a product.
[02:34:00.616 --> 02:34:01.756]  You see, we're a company.
[02:34:01.836 --> 02:34:02.116]  All right.
[02:34:02.516 --> 02:34:03.897]  We're selling you a product.
[02:34:04.917 --> 02:34:09.379]  But you can only buy the product under certain conditions.
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:10.860]  Right.
[02:34:11.380 --> 02:34:11.720]  Really?
[02:34:12.100 --> 02:34:13.241]  I just want to buy the product.
[02:34:13.321 --> 02:34:14.721]  No, it's not that easy.
[02:34:15.382 --> 02:34:16.362]  Doesn't work that way.
[02:34:17.762 --> 02:34:28.127]  We have a list of conditions here that you have to, you know, satisfy in order to buy the product from us who are selling it.
[02:34:29.708 --> 02:34:31.109]  Sounds a little strange, doesn't it?
[02:34:31.129 --> 02:34:31.349]  No?
[02:34:31.449 --> 02:34:33.030]  Well, that's the way we do business.
[02:34:33.130 --> 02:34:33.490]  Okay.
[02:34:33.610 --> 02:34:35.151]  Well, what are the conditions?
[02:34:35.191 --> 02:34:36.051]  Well, here they are.
[02:34:36.552 --> 02:34:37.112]  One, two, three.
[02:34:37.232 --> 02:34:38.212]  Oh, I see.
[02:34:38.312 --> 02:34:38.693]  I see.
[02:34:39.173 --> 02:34:40.013]  Oh, this one here.
[02:34:41.014 --> 02:34:41.594]  That's right.
[02:34:42.094 --> 02:34:43.055]  Gotta get vaccinated.
[02:34:43.775 --> 02:34:45.176]  So in other words, if I don't,
[02:34:46.124 --> 02:34:47.484]  Then I can't buy your product.
[02:34:47.685 --> 02:34:48.425]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:34:49.405 --> 02:34:50.846]  We're standing up for that.
[02:34:51.746 --> 02:35:00.369]  We won't sell you the product, and neither will our colleagues who are in our competitors who own other airlines.
[02:35:01.629 --> 02:35:05.631]  If you don't meet this condition, you can't buy their product either.
[02:35:07.852 --> 02:35:08.372]  All right.
[02:35:08.412 --> 02:35:14.974]  Well, it sounds like you're kind of shoving us out of the market, out of your market of potential customers.
[02:35:15.737 --> 02:35:18.500]  It sounds like you're pushing us away.
[02:35:20.342 --> 02:35:22.324]  So I guess we'll take the hint.
[02:35:23.986 --> 02:35:26.169]  You don't want us to participate.
[02:35:26.869 --> 02:35:31.254]  You don't want us to fork over our money to buy your product.
[02:35:31.334 --> 02:35:31.795]  Okay.
[02:35:32.596 --> 02:35:32.976]  All right.
[02:35:34.218 --> 02:35:35.239]  That's the way you want it.
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:37.321]  That's the way it'll be.
[02:35:40.413 --> 02:36:04.005]  And if the number of people who are turning down the vaccine, as reports continue to surface, about people having serious adverse reactions, keeling over, dying, if that number of people who turn down the vaccine keeps expanding, these companies may decide that they're going to alter their conditions.
[02:36:04.826 --> 02:36:05.486]  Wouldn't you?
[02:36:06.467 --> 02:36:07.647]  If you were the head of a company?
[02:36:08.688 --> 02:36:08.908]  Okay.
[02:36:11.561 --> 02:36:12.522]  What else here?
[02:36:13.702 --> 02:36:16.564]  Let's move on to yet another story.
[02:36:17.765 --> 02:36:25.770]  I don't know whether I cover this completely in the next five minutes or so, but let's start anyway.
[02:36:26.411 --> 02:36:29.813]  This has to do with Antifa and BL and Black Lives Matter.
[02:36:33.495 --> 02:36:39.579]  The publicity, the PR, the spear of the movement
[02:36:40.839 --> 02:36:49.443]  appears to be stemming from police shootings of innocent black people.
[02:36:52.044 --> 02:36:54.585]  That's what the news is saying.
[02:36:54.625 --> 02:36:55.865]  That's what the groups are saying.
[02:36:56.426 --> 02:36:57.406]  Police brutality.
[02:36:58.407 --> 02:36:58.667]  Okay.
[02:36:59.787 --> 02:37:00.127]  All right.
[02:37:02.048 --> 02:37:08.871]  Now, if you took an objective look, I don't care whether you're white, black,
[02:37:09.500 --> 02:37:11.940]  Green, blue, orange, purple.
[02:37:12.721 --> 02:37:39.066]  If you took a look at neighborhoods, inner-city, poverty-stricken neighborhoods, okay, and you interviewed people, mainly, don't listen to the men, listen to the women, the mothers, in particular, of children who raise their children, many, many of them,
[02:37:40.074 --> 02:37:41.976]  In single-parent households.
[02:37:43.437 --> 02:37:47.159]  What the biggest problems really are in those neighborhoods.
[02:37:49.061 --> 02:37:57.047]  And I would be willing to bet once you got these mothers to speak with you honestly they would say drugs, gangs, crime.
[02:37:58.008 --> 02:37:59.609]  Drugs, gangs, crime.
[02:38:00.089 --> 02:38:00.650]  Shootings.
[02:38:02.571 --> 02:38:03.051]  Violence.
[02:38:06.474 --> 02:38:07.815]  Dangerous streets.
[02:38:08.656 --> 02:38:09.036]  Gangs.
[02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:10.070]  Crime.
[02:38:11.991 --> 02:38:12.431]  Drugs.
[02:38:14.932 --> 02:38:18.954]  Recruitment of young children into gangs.
[02:38:23.316 --> 02:38:28.979]  But, of course, we're not hearing about that from Antifa or BLM.
[02:38:29.579 --> 02:38:31.080]  Or from politicians.
[02:38:33.237 --> 02:38:35.278]  Not just talking now about Antifa or BLM.
[02:38:35.298 --> 02:38:37.859]  We're not hearing that from politicians.
[02:38:37.879 --> 02:38:40.700]  We're not hearing it from major media news.
[02:38:41.300 --> 02:38:55.126]  We're not hearing about it from educators or social scientists or psychologists, academicians, universities, think tanks.
[02:38:58.407 --> 02:39:01.288]  Nothing in the mainstream about
[02:39:02.193 --> 02:39:27.171]  The major problem going on in these neighborhoods, which by the way, and not just casually, makes it extremely difficult for outside investment money to come in to finance any kind of economic traction and growth of businesses in these inner-city communities.
[02:39:27.191 --> 02:39:31.954]  So, what about the gang problem?
[02:39:34.321 --> 02:39:35.161]  In these areas.
[02:39:36.822 --> 02:39:38.063]  And I'll put this to you.
[02:39:40.244 --> 02:39:44.827]  Do you remember when certain mafia families in New York were wiped out?
[02:39:47.168 --> 02:39:48.089]  By court cases.
[02:39:49.489 --> 02:39:51.510]  And what preceded those court cases?
[02:39:52.891 --> 02:39:55.432]  It was a new federal law called RICO.
[02:39:56.493 --> 02:39:57.233]  R-I-C-O.
[02:39:57.293 --> 02:39:58.214]  That was the acronym.
[02:40:00.965 --> 02:40:09.551]  And it was basically a law which permitted prosecutions of continuing criminal enterprises.
[02:40:11.832 --> 02:40:12.112]  Okay?
[02:40:12.172 --> 02:40:14.274]  Which mobs are.
[02:40:15.194 --> 02:40:19.137]  Gangs, significant gangs, are that.
[02:40:21.798 --> 02:40:30.284]  And certain mafia families in the New York, New Jersey area were dismantled at the top, in the middle,
[02:40:31.431 --> 02:40:33.373]  With these RICO prosecutions?
[02:40:38.657 --> 02:40:40.018]  Think it through, folks.
[02:40:42.661 --> 02:40:48.285]  Could these RICO prosecutions be leveled at inner-city black neighborhood gangs?
[02:40:49.326 --> 02:40:50.027]  Big gangs?
[02:40:51.548 --> 02:40:53.510]  As continuing criminal enterprises?
[02:40:54.351 --> 02:40:54.971]  You betcha.
[02:40:55.852 --> 02:40:57.133]  You could bet the farm on that.
[02:40:58.359 --> 02:41:02.440]  You could bet the absolute bottom dollar you've got on that.
[02:41:03.381 --> 02:41:13.864]  The evidence is everywhere that these are violent, criminal, predatory, continuing criminal enterprises.
[02:41:15.764 --> 02:41:19.926]  They could be, in other words, legally dismantled.
[02:41:21.946 --> 02:41:27.968]  In not just one city, say Chicago, but a number of key cities.
[02:41:29.460 --> 02:41:31.562]  And I'm not just talking about now.
[02:41:32.282 --> 02:41:37.046]  I'm talking about ever since the RICO laws were passed.
[02:41:38.968 --> 02:41:40.029]  That could have been the case.
[02:41:40.609 --> 02:41:42.751]  So why wasn't it and why isn't it?
[02:41:43.471 --> 02:41:44.512]  Answer after the break.
[02:41:45.493 --> 02:41:46.954]  Okay, last segment here.
[02:41:47.775 --> 02:41:49.917]  John Rappaport, last segment of this hour.
[02:41:50.877 --> 02:41:54.240]  Talking about gangs in inner-city black neighborhoods.
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:55.421]  Serious gangs.
[02:41:57.242 --> 02:41:59.024]  Which if you interview the mothers,
[02:41:59.844 --> 02:42:08.711]  They will tell you, when they're speaking honestly, this is the major, the most serious problem in this neighborhood.
[02:42:09.311 --> 02:42:15.096]  Drugs, gangs, crime, shooting, recruitment, danger.
[02:42:16.377 --> 02:42:18.158]  It all goes back to these gangs.
[02:42:19.359 --> 02:42:28.386]  Which, as I detailed in the last segment, could be prosecuted under RICO as continuing criminal enterprises.
[02:42:29.230 --> 02:42:30.271]  No doubt about it.
[02:42:31.291 --> 02:42:42.296]  And can you imagine, and please try, what these neighborhoods would look like if the influence of gangs was severely, severely, severely hampered and reduced?
[02:42:43.436 --> 02:42:44.697]  It would be a whole new world.
[02:42:46.538 --> 02:42:52.420]  Okay, so how come we're not seeing these Rico prosecutions?
[02:42:54.141 --> 02:42:58.143]  Several reasons, but I want to list one very important reason.
[02:43:00.066 --> 02:43:01.687]  How do these gangs make their money?
[02:43:03.348 --> 02:43:04.088]  They sell drugs.
[02:43:05.849 --> 02:43:07.250]  Where do the drugs come from?
[02:43:08.671 --> 02:43:09.531]  Drug cartels.
[02:43:10.872 --> 02:43:16.735]  Mexico, other countries, reports of Honduras, Venezuela.
[02:43:19.157 --> 02:43:21.538]  Serious now, we're talking drug cartels.
[02:43:22.558 --> 02:43:25.260]  So, the gangs
[02:43:25.771 --> 02:43:32.937]  In America, some of them are operating as subcontractors to major drug cartels.
[02:43:35.139 --> 02:43:36.320]  As distributors.
[02:43:38.902 --> 02:43:49.571]  Not just on the street, that too, but also as what they would call trans-ship points, say from Chicago to other cities and so on and so forth.
[02:43:50.531 --> 02:43:54.715]  Vital part of the network of distributors these gangs are.
[02:43:57.768 --> 02:43:58.548]  Another question.
[02:44:00.869 --> 02:44:04.490]  What is one of the main problems of the drug cartels?
[02:44:06.231 --> 02:44:07.831]  What to do with all their cash?
[02:44:09.772 --> 02:44:15.433]  And all their cash, we're talking about a whole pile of cash, folks.
[02:44:16.434 --> 02:44:18.554]  Trillions of dollars over time.
[02:44:19.455 --> 02:44:20.355]  They gotta wash it.
[02:44:21.375 --> 02:44:22.435]  They gotta launder it.
[02:44:22.916 --> 02:44:23.976]  How do they launder it?
[02:44:24.096 --> 02:44:27.297]  Well, one of the major ways is through banks.
[02:44:33.317 --> 02:44:37.239]  And how about big corporations that need loans?
[02:44:38.079 --> 02:44:39.439]  Let's focus on banks.
[02:44:42.341 --> 02:44:50.284]  So we've got now, excuse me, not only gangs, but we've got drug cartels and banks in the mix.
[02:44:52.885 --> 02:44:58.648]  Does that begin to tell you why there are no RICO prosecutions of gangs?
[02:44:59.614 --> 02:45:02.455]  In inner cities, serious gangs in America?
[02:45:04.416 --> 02:45:26.526]  Or to put it another way, what would happen if tomorrow Antifa and BLM began to stage peaceful, peaceful street protests against drug cartels and banks as the targets?
[02:45:27.998 --> 02:45:36.121]  And informing and educating people that this is the primary factor that is destroying inner-city black neighborhoods.
[02:45:38.962 --> 02:45:43.464]  Yeah, we're here on the street and we're protesting drug cartels and banks.
[02:45:44.484 --> 02:45:44.744]  Really?
[02:45:44.784 --> 02:45:45.805]  What is this all about?
[02:45:46.705 --> 02:45:48.806]  You know, says some naive reporter.
[02:45:50.532 --> 02:45:52.253]  Let me tell you, here's what it's about.
[02:45:52.394 --> 02:45:56.397]  You see, the gangs are distributing drugs for the drug cartels.
[02:45:56.857 --> 02:45:58.278]  So the gangs are essential.
[02:45:59.179 --> 02:46:02.222]  The drug cartels wash their money through major banks.
[02:46:02.902 --> 02:46:04.643]  You see the whole network, how it looks?
[02:46:05.484 --> 02:46:10.929]  Now, the gangs could be prosecuted under RICO and destroyed, but they aren't.
[02:46:11.129 --> 02:46:11.649]  Why not?
[02:46:11.969 --> 02:46:16.053]  Because they're a vital link in the chain of drug trafficking around the U.S.
[02:46:16.793 --> 02:46:17.394]  and a major
[02:46:18.144 --> 02:46:20.805]  A media reporter goes, wow, I didn't know that.
[02:46:21.805 --> 02:46:24.405]  And the BLM member says, well, now you do.
[02:46:25.266 --> 02:46:26.126]  Now you do.
[02:46:26.726 --> 02:46:28.946]  Now you know something you didn't before.
[02:46:29.326 --> 02:46:30.487]  You're going to put it on the news?
[02:46:30.527 --> 02:46:31.207]  Well, sure.
[02:46:31.227 --> 02:46:36.428]  The naive reporter says, he gets back and he tells his editor, wow, we got a whole new story.
[02:46:36.888 --> 02:46:39.089]  BLM is going in a whole new direction.
[02:46:39.569 --> 02:46:41.289]  Wow, this is going to be fantastic.
[02:46:41.609 --> 02:46:43.469]  We got to talk to LeBron James.
[02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:45.610]  Hey, he's a big, isn't he?
[02:46:46.258 --> 02:46:47.379]  A supporter of BLM?
[02:46:47.639 --> 02:46:48.920]  Does he know about this?
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:51.981]  About the network and the drug cartels and the banks?
[02:46:52.061 --> 02:46:53.542]  And so, maybe he knows.
[02:46:53.922 --> 02:46:57.184]  We got an interview and this editor says, hold on, baby.
[02:46:59.125 --> 02:46:59.906]  Are you kidding?
[02:47:02.567 --> 02:47:07.430]  There's no way we're going to air that story that you just picked up on the street.
[02:47:07.490 --> 02:47:08.811]  What do you mean we're not going to air that?
[02:47:09.426 --> 02:47:10.186]  This is big.
[02:47:10.246 --> 02:47:11.927]  This is breaking news.
[02:47:11.947 --> 02:47:13.908]  This is nothing.
[02:47:14.048 --> 02:47:16.569]  This is just opinion and hearsay.
[02:47:16.649 --> 02:47:29.273]  No, I mean, these are organized groups out on the street protesting, and they've got educational material on the drug cartels and the banks and the gangs and RICO.
[02:47:29.814 --> 02:47:31.154]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:47:31.234 --> 02:47:33.455]  We're not touching that story with the 10 people.
[02:47:33.815 --> 02:47:35.256]  We're not going after that.
[02:47:36.076 --> 02:47:36.636]  Why not?
[02:47:36.796 --> 02:47:38.477]  Naive reporter says.
[02:47:39.804 --> 02:47:40.444]  We just aren't.
[02:47:40.664 --> 02:47:41.905]  It's just not in the cards.
[02:47:43.305 --> 02:47:44.626]  We've talked about that before.
[02:47:44.666 --> 02:47:45.346]  It's old news.
[02:47:45.406 --> 02:47:46.646]  Nobody's interested in that.
[02:47:47.346 --> 02:47:49.607]  They're only interested in police brutality.
[02:47:49.627 --> 02:47:52.088]  And that's what I, what it says.
[02:47:52.248 --> 02:47:53.808]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:47:53.928 --> 02:47:55.809]  I got a story here, Mr. Editor.
[02:47:56.709 --> 02:47:57.710]  I want to run with it.
[02:47:58.790 --> 02:48:01.451]  And the editor says, really?
[02:48:02.591 --> 02:48:08.333]  You want to risk your budding career on a story
[02:48:09.013 --> 02:48:15.157]  That I, who've been around the block a few thousand times, am telling you not to touch with a 10-foot pole?
[02:48:16.418 --> 02:48:16.739]  Really?
[02:48:16.779 --> 02:48:17.919]  Is that what's going on here?
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:22.723]  You're telling me that you insist on running this story?
[02:48:23.744 --> 02:48:36.893]  Well, maybe what you want to do is to quit your job here at the Times and start a little blog somewhere on your own out of wherever it was that you were raised, some little
[02:48:38.180 --> 02:48:39.501]  Two-bit town somewhere.
[02:48:39.541 --> 02:48:41.341]  I can't remember even the name of it now.
[02:48:42.242 --> 02:48:45.743]  And see, you can expose that story on that little blog.
[02:48:46.623 --> 02:48:47.604]  Is that what you want?
[02:48:47.704 --> 02:48:53.266]  Because if you keep throwing this story in my face, that's where you're going to end up.
[02:48:53.726 --> 02:48:55.127]  That's what's going to happen to you.
[02:48:55.547 --> 02:48:57.728]  That's going to happen to your little career.
[02:48:58.268 --> 02:49:02.750]  Because you're on track to make a significant amount of money
[02:49:03.681 --> 02:49:09.122]  And to have some kind of reputation in this business we call the news.
[02:49:09.902 --> 02:49:11.683]  But you've got to keep your nose clean.
[02:49:12.543 --> 02:49:23.725]  And I don't know who that BLM person you spoke with was or what he said, but he's leading you down the garden path to a place you do not want to go.
[02:49:24.485 --> 02:49:27.686]  Believe me, son, you do not want to go there.
[02:49:29.706 --> 02:49:29.906]  Now,
[02:49:30.791 --> 02:49:37.375]  You go back to your little desk and you think about this, and it's up to you as to what you want to do.
[02:49:38.816 --> 02:49:39.337]  Up to you.
[02:49:39.357 --> 02:49:43.720]  Yeah, that's the way it works.
[02:49:43.780 --> 02:49:46.261]  So, that's why.
[02:49:48.983 --> 02:49:59.490]  Instead, these groups like BLM and Antifa are functioning, and I'm not saying this is
[02:50:00.726 --> 02:50:13.290]  Intentional among its members, but they are functioning as diversions from what they say they're trying to accomplish, which is to improve life in inner cities.
[02:50:14.051 --> 02:50:21.953]  They are diverting attention from what the real problem is in those areas, or the biggest problem, let's say, which is gangs.
[02:50:24.474 --> 02:50:25.375]  That's what's happened.
[02:50:26.755 --> 02:50:29.296]  And that's what the celebrities,
[02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:40.836]  And the virtue signaling lefties and the celebrity athletes are not paying any attention to whatsoever.
[02:50:42.257 --> 02:50:57.767]  Because if they were, if they were actually looking into what's going on instead of just buying the publicity and the PR, and they think they're really solving the problem that they want to solve,
[02:50:58.559 --> 02:51:01.161]  They would be saying something completely different.
[02:51:04.042 --> 02:51:16.129]  One of these star athletes would be sitting on a talk show on the Sports Network saying, you know, really, what we need to be protesting against is the drug cartels and the banks.
[02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:18.370]  What?
[02:51:19.091 --> 02:51:19.351]  Really?
[02:51:19.371 --> 02:51:21.172]  Yeah, we're live, aren't we?
[02:51:21.312 --> 02:51:23.013]  Yeah, we are so far.
[02:51:23.033 --> 02:51:25.614]  I mean, where do you get this from?
[02:51:25.955 --> 02:51:26.515]  What do you mean?
[02:51:27.532 --> 02:51:34.057]  You mean that BLM should be protesting against, what did you say, drug cartels and banks?
[02:51:35.838 --> 02:51:37.319]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:51:37.379 --> 02:51:38.780]  We got to go to commercial here.
[02:51:39.441 --> 02:51:40.842]  Thanks for being on the show.
[02:51:41.863 --> 02:51:43.203]  We'll be talking to you soon.
[02:51:44.785 --> 02:51:54.812]  There's a lot of things, folks, in this country and the world that could be turned around with a certain degree of truth that are very important, and that's one of them.
[02:51:55.475 --> 02:51:56.897]  And that's me for this week.
[02:51:57.378 --> 02:51:58.259]  Talk to you next time.
[02:52:09.994 --> 02:52:19.343]  But in the modern world, it is a sophisticated, creeping political and corporate cultural system that really seeks to divide and conquer and dumb us all down.
[02:52:19.763 --> 02:52:26.750]  Now we live in this giant cancel culture, where hundreds of millions of people, not just in America, but all over the world,
[02:52:27.441 --> 02:52:29.862]  Really, billions are being suppressed and controlled by AI.
[02:52:30.923 --> 02:52:42.608]  It is more important than ever in the third dimension here on the ground that bumper stickers, license plates, t-shirts, InfoWars.com on the side of your barn or launch your own website, I don't care.
[02:52:42.968 --> 02:52:46.790]  Just speak up and don't comply and don't go along with the Great Reset.
[02:52:46.830 --> 02:52:48.411]  Don't go along with Operation Lockstep.
[02:52:48.711 --> 02:52:53.133]  Don't go along with Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Joe Biden and all these other criminals.
[02:52:53.633 --> 02:52:58.356]  So, a listener sent me an idea for a t-shirt, and it looked basically like this.
[02:52:58.396 --> 02:53:01.678]  We had our graphics department kind of beef it up and make it more high-res.
[02:53:01.978 --> 02:53:05.861]  And it's a New York-style license plate saying, FK Mask.
[02:53:06.561 --> 02:53:10.744]  And I'm not normally kind of catty like that, but seriously, F the Global is saying we're dirty.
[02:53:11.224 --> 02:53:13.046]  F the Global is trying to make us submit to them.
[02:53:13.786 --> 02:53:15.806]  Fauci, all of them admit the masks are permanent.
[02:53:15.846 --> 02:53:19.867]  They want a five-year lockdown to totally bankrupt all small businesses.
[02:53:20.507 --> 02:53:24.668]  And it's time for people to realize that top scientists admit the masks don't even protect you.
[02:53:25.128 --> 02:53:26.129]  It's a sign that you're dirty.
[02:53:26.169 --> 02:53:27.089]  It's a sign that you're bad.
[02:53:27.109 --> 02:53:27.989]  It's a sign that you're evil.
[02:53:28.329 --> 02:53:31.410]  It's a sign that you submit to the big lie that you're not essential.
[02:53:31.450 --> 02:53:33.130]  So I have this new great t-shirt.
[02:53:33.350 --> 02:53:34.050]  A limited edition.
[02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:35.170]  I think it's gonna be a bestseller.
[02:53:35.570 --> 02:53:37.131]  And it's FK Mask.
[02:53:37.191 --> 02:53:37.551]  On the back,
[02:53:38.351 --> 02:53:39.992]  Infowars.com.
[02:53:40.092 --> 02:53:41.673]  But what about F. Biden?
[02:53:42.153 --> 02:53:44.014]  That's right, the most popular president in U.S.
[02:53:44.034 --> 02:53:44.495]  history.
[02:53:44.935 --> 02:53:46.476]  The president-elect forever.
[02:53:47.276 --> 02:53:48.217]  Our leader, our king.
[02:53:48.257 --> 02:53:49.137]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[02:53:49.417 --> 02:53:50.178]  China Joe.
[02:53:51.379 --> 02:53:53.920]  We have another great variant of this license plate shirt.
[02:53:54.681 --> 02:53:55.401]  F. Biden.
[02:53:55.701 --> 02:53:58.303]  And again, this is a major thought crime.
[02:53:58.363 --> 02:54:00.464]  We are not worshipping our dear leader.
[02:54:00.964 --> 02:54:03.886]  The Democrats at MSN have said it should be illegal
[02:54:04.830 --> 02:54:06.991]  to even criticize him or say he stole the election.
[02:54:07.751 --> 02:54:10.252]  So, we're going to exercise our first amendment in the face of the tyrants.
[02:54:10.772 --> 02:54:14.513]  I'm going to get this second limited edition shirt at importwarrestore.com while you still can.
[02:54:14.553 --> 02:54:16.073]  This one's really politically incorrect.
[02:54:16.613 --> 02:54:17.214]  F-tyranny.
[02:54:17.534 --> 02:54:18.554]  F-the-GG-thing.
[02:54:19.034 --> 02:54:22.755]  Yes, the third in this new line of limited editions.
[02:54:23.315 --> 02:54:23.895]  F-tyranny.
[02:54:24.396 --> 02:54:24.896]  F-Biden.
[02:54:25.456 --> 02:54:26.016]  F-the-mass.
[02:54:26.236 --> 02:54:28.297]  All available at importwarrestore.com.
[02:54:28.637 --> 02:54:29.137]  But wait!
[02:54:30.270 --> 02:54:31.931]  There's more, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:32.291 --> 02:54:37.134]  This design is already a bestseller, came out a month ago, and people are ordering like hotcakes.
[02:54:37.254 --> 02:54:38.274]  Biden is so upset.
[02:54:38.535 --> 02:54:40.255]  How dare you thought criminals promote this?
[02:54:40.576 --> 02:54:41.616]  How dare you wear this?
[02:54:42.357 --> 02:54:43.337]  Trader Joe's.
[02:54:43.877 --> 02:54:50.981]  For the four nations on record, Russia, China, Ukraine, you name it, Iran, that Biden has sold us out to.
[02:54:51.001 --> 02:54:57.085]  Do what Tim Cook says, you dirty Americans, and do not get the Trader Joe's shirt at InfoWarshore.com, whatever you do.
[02:54:57.805 --> 02:55:01.348]  Don't get this best-selling hat we've had out for six years.
[02:55:01.748 --> 02:55:02.388]  1776, baby.
[02:55:02.769 --> 02:55:03.749]  Made in America.
[02:55:04.170 --> 02:55:05.611]  Infowars.com.
[02:55:05.931 --> 02:55:07.732]  Do not visit Infowars.com.
[02:55:07.872 --> 02:55:08.333]  Give up.
[02:55:08.653 --> 02:55:09.674]  Roll over and die.
[02:55:10.114 --> 02:55:12.856]  Don't go to the organization Fighting Tyranny for 27 years.
[02:55:13.116 --> 02:55:16.459]  Don't go to the group that raised the alarm first and has been the most hardcore.
