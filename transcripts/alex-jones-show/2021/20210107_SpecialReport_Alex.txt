[00:00:00.805 --> 00:00:10.310]  So here we are, January 7th, the day, hello ladies, the day after the fiasco at the Capitol.
[00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:12.051]  Trump had a million people in this rally.
[00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:12.732]  It was historic.
[00:00:13.652 --> 00:00:20.036]  And now we've learned Antifa helped start fights with the police, got the police to attack, and then patriots fought back and took the bait.
[00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:21.777]  It was a very small percentage of people.
[00:00:22.837 --> 00:00:28.961]  And so this is a historic moment down here where we're not accepting this election fraud and the deep state.
[00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.030]  That's in everything it can to call this the new Pearl Harbor.
[00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.491]  Really, no Democrats died, no Republicans died.
[00:00:35.592 --> 00:00:39.213]  Four citizens died, including an innocent woman.
[00:00:40.554 --> 00:00:41.775]  And so now there's the D.C.
[00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.016]  capital of the United States.
[00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:47.277]  I've never seen it with a riot fence up around it.
[00:00:48.578 --> 00:00:52.120]  So they didn't put that up when BLM or Antifa was rioting and burning D.C.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.843]  They didn't put stuff up like that in Portland, or in Seattle, or in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[00:00:59.343 --> 00:01:00.144]  They put it up here.
[00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:10.131]  Because hundreds of thousands of people showed up and a few of them went inside the Capitol and were told things didn't get violent, so they started shooting and killing people.
[00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:17.716]  So when conservatives go out and demonstrate as terrorism, when the left goes out and burns down police stations, it's a great thing.
[00:01:17.756 --> 00:01:24.021]  Maxine Waters said, confront them in their houses, confront them on the street, confront them at gas stations, confront them everywhere.
[00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:29.345]  And the left just came out to Josh Hawley's house and threatened his wife and newborn baby when he was gone.
[00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:33.728]  Now here we are with the D.C.
[00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:44.036]  Capitol, the National Capitol, surrounded by a fence because they're stealing this country.
[00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:46.037]  They're putting their CHICOM agent in there.
[00:01:46.378 --> 00:01:49.640]  They're overriding the will of the American people.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.943]  I was up on that building today where we rented a space on a roof to do our live show.
[00:01:53.803 --> 00:01:57.146]  We saw maybe 100 people out here protesting the election.
[00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:57.746]  They were peaceful.
[00:01:58.907 --> 00:01:59.588]  The riot police.
[00:02:00.546 --> 00:02:05.310]  Pushed them back under orders all the way down here, a couple hundred yards.
[00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.896]  We're gonna go see if we can talk to those people right now, but we're here with this historic situation happening and Chuck Schumer said he's never gonna let this die.
[00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:15.417]  What, the four people he killed?
[00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:16.658]  Absolutely.
[00:02:16.698 --> 00:02:20.961]  The four people maybe, the word is his security person, may have been the person that shot that woman in the neck.
[00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:21.722]  We're gonna find out.
[00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:23.963]  Don't worry Schumer, I'm gonna let this die either.
[00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:26.746]  How when you burn down cities and burn down
[00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:31.358]  Public housing and burn down police stations and burn down nursing homes.
[00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:32.899]  It's good when you're leftist to it.
[00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:43.726]  But when we show up by a million people and a few folks storm the Capitol like they did in Wisconsin, like they did in Michigan, they were smart enough in Michigan and Wisconsin not to attack the people.
[00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:45.106]  But here they did.
[00:02:45.146 --> 00:02:46.787]  They killed four U.S.
[00:02:46.807 --> 00:02:52.931]  citizens and you have the media turning that around, calling that an insurrection, calling the American people bad.
[00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:54.052]  That's disgusting.
[00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.510]  And China is now praising the U.S.
[00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:58.271]  and its crackdown.
[00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:01.213]  China's not elected, it's the Communist Party.
[00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:04.736]  The same party's been in control, passing it on to their children.
[00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:06.397]  You think I'm right, guys?
[00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:11.881]  Since Mao Zedong was put into power in 1949.
[00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:21.529]  So this is a republic where we the people govern, not the Communist Party, China.
[00:03:22.793 --> 00:03:25.294]  So we're going over here to find the protesters that were peaceful.
[00:03:26.054 --> 00:03:27.714]  I was watching them from that rooftop right there.
[00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:29.795]  We love you.
[00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:30.935]  See that rooftop right there?
[00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:38.738]  We were up there watching a peaceful crowd push back over here.
[00:03:38.758 --> 00:03:40.198]  We understand the police are being ordered to do this.
[00:03:40.818 --> 00:03:48.220]  We understand Antifa came in, caused the crisis, caused the problem, triggered the emergency.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.361]  So all of this could be legitimized.
[00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:52.523]  Hell, look, they got an armored truck over there.
[00:03:53.744 --> 00:03:54.324]  Look over there, dude.
[00:03:55.244 --> 00:03:56.265]  Why do we have an armored truck?
[00:03:57.225 --> 00:04:01.566]  Because Antifa attacks us everywhere we go.
[00:04:02.607 --> 00:04:02.947]  Hey, brother.
[00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:08.569]  And we've got to have an armored vehicle to even be able to go out in public because Antifa attacks us.
[00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:09.569]  God bless you, brother.
[00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.050]  So the left tried to trick Americans
[00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:13.315]  Yes sir.
[00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:13.556]  Right.
[00:04:34.997 --> 00:04:37.298]  But it's not the course we want to take because we have the truth.
[00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.759]  We have justice.
[00:04:39.299 --> 00:04:40.460]  We know the election was stolen.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.041]  We don't need violence to win.
[00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:43.922]  That's the left that wants violence.
[00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:47.064]  That's the left that wants authoritarianism.
[00:04:47.884 --> 00:04:53.027]  That's the left that doesn't want us to have free speech and big tech.
[00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:55.952]  And now even our president is being censored on Twitter.
[00:04:55.972 --> 00:04:56.452]  That's fine.
[00:04:57.212 --> 00:05:01.154]  He needs to address the country and the world from the Oval Office in the next 13 days.
[00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:05.936]  12 days is a few hours before they put in that communist Chinese puppet, Joe Biden.
[00:05:06.336 --> 00:05:08.657]  I'm here to tell you, he's already told us.
[00:05:09.758 --> 00:05:12.339]  They're never taking their foot off our neck.
[00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.540]  They're never stopping us.
[00:05:15.814 --> 00:05:17.235]  From resisting them at the same time.
[00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:19.437]  Because they know we're never going to back down.
[00:05:20.038 --> 00:05:23.500]  But they're never going to take their foot off our neck until we stop them.
[00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:26.883]  Because that's their plan, and that's who they are.
[00:05:27.884 --> 00:05:37.792]  So yeah, I wasn't even going to come down here, but I saw folks push back here, all the way to this line, here at an actual park.
[00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:41.736]  And all we're trying to do is find out what's happening.
[00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:45.567]  Here in America, because this is a historic moment.
[00:05:45.587 --> 00:05:46.647]  You know, I came here yesterday.
[00:05:47.328 --> 00:05:49.068]  There were already 100,000 people or so here.
[00:05:49.088 --> 00:05:52.050]  And I told them, turn back, don't go in the Capitol.
[00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.311]  Some didn't listen.
[00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:56.513]  But the vast majority did listen to us and didn't go in.
[00:05:56.593 --> 00:05:58.334]  And all of them were demonized as terrorists.
[00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:12.725]  And we're demonized as bad people, even with their children, because they came here to demonstrate.
[00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:14.566]  That shows you the system.
[00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:15.587]  They don't want patriots.
[00:06:16.107 --> 00:06:17.228]  They don't want nationalists.
[00:06:17.788 --> 00:06:20.069]  They don't want populists to demonstrate.
[00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:25.732]  They only want communists and idiot students to demonstrate because they want to silence the rest of us, but it's not happening.
[00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:27.453]  So that's why we're here.
[00:06:27.473 --> 00:06:32.156]  By the time we got down here, I guess 100 demonstrators or so are already gone.
[00:06:32.196 --> 00:06:34.117]  But this is where they were all pushed back to.
[00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.438]  And I guess this is where the media has been told.
[00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:40.333]  They're supposed to go and they're supposed to be able to speak out.
[00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:42.513]  Here we are.
[00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:43.454]  Watch the puddle.
[00:06:43.594 --> 00:06:44.534]  Watch the puddle.
[00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:54.957]  But that right there is the people's capital, not G.G.Ping's capital.
[00:06:56.097 --> 00:06:57.838]  And so they're the ones that stole the election.
[00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:00.158]  They're the ones that engaged in this fraud.
[00:07:00.178 --> 00:07:01.118]  We don't want any violence.
[00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:06.640]  But they're the ones that created the climate that has triggered events like this.
[00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:10.996]  And so again, we're investigating Antifa.
[00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:12.520]  They bragged.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.244]  They were coming here to dress as Proud Boys.
[00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:15.267]  They chanted F.
[00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:25.728]  Antifa for hours before Trump even finished his speech, they attacked the police, and they got the police to come out and attack the demonstrators to trigger the storming.
[00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:29.529]  And yes, some people took the bait, some red-blooded Americans.
[00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:34.870]  But the truth is, it's going to come out that Antifa is a George Soros organized crime syndicate.
[00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:43.312]  We have the documents from other cities, like Baltimore, Maryland, where they go and stage riots, trying to get Americans to riot so they can bring down society.
[00:07:43.512 --> 00:07:44.712]  They did the same thing in Ukraine.
[00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:48.514]  And folks like Oliver Stone have made films about it, Ukraine burning.
[00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:54.639]  And so the truth about George Soros and their whole operation is beginning to come out.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.223]  And yeah, we got sucker punks yesterday, and some patriots got fooled into going in there.
[00:07:59.663 --> 00:08:02.345]  It's their house, but they shouldn't have busted in like they did.
[00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:04.607]  They played to their plans, but that's okay.
[00:08:05.528 --> 00:08:06.788]  Because at the end of the day,
[00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:12.261]  Truth will end up coming out, and George Soros and the Globalists and their false flag are going down.
[00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:19.928]  And I want to salute all Americans, from every race, color, and creed, who came out here for election integrity, because we will never surrender!
[00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.654]  And no one is buying their false elections, no one is buying their garbage.
[00:08:25.854 --> 00:08:31.219]  This is the USA, this is our country, and we're only beginning to fight, so I want to thank you all.
[00:08:34.696 --> 00:08:35.598]  Alright guys, let's go.
[00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:35.978]  USA!
[00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:36.660]  USA!
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.281]  USA!
[00:08:55.501 --> 00:09:01.369]  We're just out here exercising our First Amendment in America.
[00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:41.444]  Once people had already started going to the Capitol, I tried to get them to turn around and not invade it.
[00:09:42.907 --> 00:09:45.652]  But it was a mob psychology triggered by Antifa, we think.
[00:09:46.513 --> 00:09:52.123]  A false flag, so... Still though, Patriots did take the bait, so... Antifa wins this one!
[00:10:08.015 --> 00:10:09.456]  Those are some crazy five feet tall.
[00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:10.797]  They're definitely scramblers.
[00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:12.778]  I think they're cell phone scramblers.
[00:10:12.798 --> 00:10:14.019]  You gotta talk about bringing water.
[00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.519]  I'm not gonna bring water today.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.602]  Alex, you never talk about the New World Order.
[00:10:19.622 --> 00:10:20.002]  What's wrong?
[00:10:21.343 --> 00:10:22.824]  Talk about the Federal Reserve.
[00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:23.844]  Talk about the globalists, Alex.
[00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.185]  We got rain issues.
[00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:28.247]  We got all kinds of things going on.
[00:10:28.347 --> 00:10:30.849]  It's the right thing to do to give us peace.
[00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:44.099]  Let's get back on the sidewalk.
[00:10:44.119 --> 00:10:45.740]  Those are some crazy looking deals.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.762]  Oh yeah.
[00:10:48.802 --> 00:10:50.423]  That's a lot of wires up there.
[00:10:50.443 --> 00:10:51.564]  Get some footage of that?
[00:10:51.584 --> 00:10:51.664]  Yeah.
[00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:56.508]  There's something to Treasure Strip right here.
[00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:18.939]  I never feel... Look at that.
[00:11:19.019 --> 00:11:23.520]  Look at all the power.
[00:11:40.874 --> 00:11:41.494]  I'm still rolling.
[00:11:41.514 --> 00:11:42.094]  Keep going.
[00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:50.237]  Look at this next generation, probably 6G, fry your brain with vitamin radiation.
[00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:51.697]  Holy hell.
[00:11:52.617 --> 00:11:55.438]  Look at this big open air system.
[00:11:55.478 --> 00:11:57.298]  I feel like I'm dying just being underneath it.
[00:11:57.358 --> 00:11:58.919]  It's not psychosomatic.
[00:11:59.079 --> 00:12:02.460]  Good lord, double nutrition for you.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.080]  With the chemtrail.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.740]  Look, right there.
[00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:08.021]  And Bill Gates admits they're involved in weather modification.
[00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:09.022]  I love it.
[00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.022]  Behind the chemtrail.
[00:12:10.982 --> 00:12:17.643]  We've got the loving whatever that is inside the little communication bubbles hanging with wires everywhere.
[00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:21.244]  I'm sure it's nutritious even though the studies show it all gives you brain cancer.
[00:12:21.624 --> 00:12:22.304]  Is this 6G?
[00:12:22.364 --> 00:12:23.145]  Is it 7G?
[00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:24.825]  Is this Satan G?
[00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:25.325]  What is this?
[00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:25.805]  Look at it.
[00:12:32.587 --> 00:12:33.907]  Look at these power couplers.
[00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:44.868]  HB beam 14.
[00:12:46.168 --> 00:12:46.909]  HB beam 15.
[00:12:46.969 --> 00:12:49.049]  HB beam 13.
[00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:51.010]  HB beam 16.
[00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:52.970]  HB beam 17.
[00:12:53.010 --> 00:13:01.152]  Those are like major poplars.
[00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:05.833]  Fiber optics?
[00:13:05.973 --> 00:13:06.973]  Fiber optics clean.
[00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:11.614]  So I guess it picks up electromagnetic broadcast and puts it into fiber optics.
[00:13:12.523 --> 00:13:15.125]  Fiber optic's the way you actually want to go, that's fiber optic.
[00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:16.686]  But again, it's still picking up wireless.
[00:13:16.706 --> 00:13:17.047]  Look at that.
[00:13:17.107 --> 00:13:17.527]  Wow.
[00:13:18.127 --> 00:13:20.209]  So I guess that's a crossover.
[00:13:20.249 --> 00:13:26.474]  That's wireless to, uh, that's wireless, it looks like, to, uh, wireless to fiber optic.
[00:13:26.714 --> 00:13:28.816]  God, no cancer, no radiation.
[00:13:29.436 --> 00:13:34.740]  I think what they're going to do with this, this is to generate actual people on the ground for Biden's inauguration.
[00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:36.922]  Oh, this is a virtual generator?
[00:13:37.002 --> 00:13:38.924]  A virtual audience generator.
[00:13:41.086 --> 00:13:42.346]  Yeah, they just put this in.
[00:13:46.369 --> 00:13:48.330]  Yeah, look, it's like a computer that's outside the box.
[00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.231]  It's all like right here.
[00:13:49.251 --> 00:13:54.574]  There's a lot of weird stuff going on in this town.
[00:13:54.654 --> 00:13:56.135]  Interdimensional controller?
[00:13:57.076 --> 00:14:00.998]  Well, I don't think the humans like it.
[00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:09.273]  Yeah, tell me about, tell me brother, tell me who got arrested, tell me what happened.
[00:14:09.293 --> 00:14:11.875]  We arrested Nick Fuentes and a bunch of the other people inside.
[00:14:11.955 --> 00:14:13.115]  I didn't even know that, tell me.
[00:14:14.016 --> 00:14:15.677]  So, a bunch of the people went into Capitol.
[00:14:15.797 --> 00:14:17.418]  I'm going to pause this because now we've got a bunch of other cameras.
[00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:18.259]  Here, let's turn this way.
[00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.660]  Turn this way, it sounds better.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.160]  Right here.
[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:20.980]  Let's get behind the fire.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.323]  What's the 800G over here?
[00:14:24.343 --> 00:14:24.963]  800G background.
[00:14:25.852 --> 00:14:46.068]  So in the capital we saw a lot of the videos people are going in there and I didn't make it in I was having a hamburger and I got there and later on I'm hearing that they shut the doors after people went in and they use that to clear a bunch of people out and everybody was locked inside they arrested and now they're being charged with domestic terrorism.
[00:14:46.929 --> 00:14:48.810]  Wow, I didn't know Nick Fuentes got arrested.
[00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.473]  Gosh, I mean, we don't even know who the other three people that were died, four died, we're told.
[00:14:52.513 --> 00:14:55.195]  Do you know anything about that?
[00:14:55.215 --> 00:14:55.815]  Yeah, I saw the woman.
[00:14:55.835 --> 00:14:56.496]  She's all bloodied.
[00:14:56.516 --> 00:14:58.377]  I saw the video where she actually got shot.
[00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:01.179]  And the fact that it's happening in America is insane.
[00:15:01.699 --> 00:15:02.880]  These are the Capitol Hill police.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.361]  We're supposed to be able to trust the police.
[00:15:04.501 --> 00:15:06.483]  And for the last four years, we've been saying back the blue.
[00:15:08.092 --> 00:15:10.393]  Well, we know Antifa came and started the fight with the police.
[00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.893]  It looks like they were doing a false flag.
[00:15:12.334 --> 00:15:13.194]  But I mean, this is huge.
[00:15:13.554 --> 00:15:16.275]  But yeah, I wondered, because I told my own crew, don't go inside.
[00:15:16.835 --> 00:15:19.456]  Just because I know they try to set people up, but I guess a few still went in.
[00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:22.737]  But there was like Al Jazeera, CNN.
[00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:24.058]  What was the other one?
[00:15:24.278 --> 00:15:25.598]  National Geographic.
[00:15:25.618 --> 00:15:27.499]  National Geographic, ABC.
[00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:28.839]  We have footage of all them in there.
[00:15:29.139 --> 00:15:30.140]  So did they let them out?
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.681]  I have no idea.
[00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:33.302]  I don't know.
[00:15:33.402 --> 00:15:33.943]  Oh, we gotta go.
[00:15:33.963 --> 00:15:35.624]  Thank you so much, Mr. Jones.
[00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.526]  I didn't know Nick Fuentes got arrested.
[00:15:37.546 --> 00:15:37.846]  That's bad.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:56.064]  Alex, you jumped up on top of the chairs yesterday when I was up there and I got everything.
[00:15:56.084 --> 00:16:01.846]  Please get it out because they're trying to say I'm trying to get everybody to do that.
[00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:02.726]  Thank you sir.
[00:16:02.766 --> 00:16:03.286]  God bless you.
[00:16:03.766 --> 00:16:04.487]  God bless you brother.
[00:16:06.392 --> 00:16:10.536]  Some guy's got his grandkid right there.
[00:16:10.556 --> 00:16:11.777]  That's a cute grandchild.
[00:16:11.797 --> 00:16:13.958]  That's my grandbaby, dude.
[00:16:13.978 --> 00:16:15.379]  2006, I've been following this.
[00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:17.962]  Congratulations, brother.
[00:16:18.042 --> 00:16:20.163]  We love you, brother.
[00:16:20.203 --> 00:16:21.584]  That's a cutie right there.
[00:16:21.604 --> 00:16:22.225]  Thank you.
[00:16:22.285 --> 00:16:24.006]  Go down to the crosswalk.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.102]  Alright, dude.
[00:16:39.122 --> 00:16:41.544]  We'll probably end this transmission soon.
[00:16:41.844 --> 00:16:42.504]  Alright.
[00:16:42.824 --> 00:16:46.026]  And they can just play Eclipse on the War Room.
[00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:46.466]  Okay.
[00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:47.687]  Good people out here.
[00:16:48.658 --> 00:16:51.421]  There's a few more people over here, but I don't want to block the road.
[00:16:51.461 --> 00:16:52.522]  Do what, brother?
[00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:53.203]  Well, I know this.
[00:16:53.223 --> 00:16:56.106]  I don't like what happened to George Floyd.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.962]  But let me tell you, she didn't deserve what happened to her either.
[00:17:13.002 --> 00:17:14.683]  We didn't remember her.
[00:17:14.703 --> 00:17:18.126]  I agree, we need to have a shrine.
[00:17:18.426 --> 00:17:19.968]  My wife had the idea to have a shrine to her.
[00:17:28.054 --> 00:17:31.397]  As soon as I started saying, her name was Velvet!
[00:17:31.777 --> 00:17:32.958]  They let us back in.
[00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:38.843]  So there was a bomb threat out here, that's what we heard, yeah.
[00:17:38.903 --> 00:17:42.045]  It was a suspicious package.
[00:17:42.726 --> 00:17:47.829]  Well, make no mistake, they're trying to steal our election from us, but this is going to backfire on them, folks.
[00:17:49.271 --> 00:17:50.351]  How's it going to backfire?
[00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:56.256]  If we don't submit to it, and we don't let it demoralize us, we just get stronger.
[00:17:57.512 --> 00:17:58.092]  So that's it.
[00:17:58.213 --> 00:18:01.355]  We see all the leaders in here, right?
[00:18:01.395 --> 00:18:03.076]  None of them know how we live.
[00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:04.276]  Us, everyday people.
[00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:06.038]  How do you think we can change that?
[00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:10.641]  How do you think we can have people in there who relate to us, American people?
[00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:12.842]  I'm trying my best, brother.
[00:18:12.962 --> 00:18:15.584]  InfoWars.com, baby!
[00:18:15.624 --> 00:18:16.905]  Do more than a minute!
[00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:18.206]  More than a minute!
[00:18:18.386 --> 00:18:19.106]  Fan.video!
[00:18:19.286 --> 00:18:21.027]  Fan.video right here!
[00:18:27.298 --> 00:18:28.139]  Alright guys, we're done.
[00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:29.380]  We're not having a demonstration.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:29.820]  Be safe.
[00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:31.981]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:18:32.282 --> 00:18:32.782]  God bless you.
[00:18:32.802 --> 00:18:35.544]  We wanted to just go check stuff out, but it became a circus.
[00:18:35.584 --> 00:18:37.626]  So, that's probably good for the live feed there.
[00:18:37.706 --> 00:18:38.046]  Alright.
[00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:45.111]  Anyways, we're going back up here where we're doing our live feed.
[00:18:57.655 --> 00:18:58.506]  InfoWars.com
[00:19:05.129 --> 00:19:16.033]  I really want to talk about perhaps getting into the more spiritual side of things, and we talk about the energy and the spirit of things.
[00:19:16.093 --> 00:19:32.118]  I'm a musician, I'm an artist, and so it's important for me to be clear-headed and to make sure that I'm able to tap into that unseen force, that higher power that we're all... I've been preaching a lot about connectivity and the way that music affects us,
[00:19:32.418 --> 00:19:46.334]  And as we get closer to that spirit, and I was saying how the Infowars products keeps my spirit clean, it keeps my body healthy so that I can function at a higher level, my body's able to, my brain's able to function.
[00:19:46.354 --> 00:19:47.415]  Which product do you like the best?
[00:19:47.415 --> 00:19:54.418]  What's really, really, really changed my life is the knockout, but also the Chill Force with the GABA has changed my life.
[00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:57.680]  I'm one of these people, again, you know, I'm an artist, so, you know, I'm a little bit of a diva.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:15.849]  I have problems with anxiety, I've experienced depression, and since I've been on, I've taken the Chill Force Challenge with Chill Force and Brain Force, the GABA has done amazing things for me with anxiety and keeping me, you know, me calm and not having me react the way that
[00:20:16.189 --> 00:20:20.454]  You know, your brain reacts when the neurotransmitters just fire.
[00:20:20.514 --> 00:20:25.681]  And again, go and research the products and what they can do.
[00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:29.025]  Well, that's what we do is we go out of what's already proven to work.
[00:20:29.365 --> 00:20:30.687]  Then we just source organic.
[00:20:31.067 --> 00:20:31.787]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.647 --> 00:21:01.968]  And you like them, and absolutely.
[00:21:01.988 --> 00:21:02.248]  I do.
[00:21:02.448 --> 00:21:04.849]  Mother Nature is where the drug companies got all their stuff.
[00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:06.030]  They just twist it around.
[00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.211]  And that's all we're bringing you, is what God gave us.
[00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.553]  And so they are amazing products, and I appreciate you saying those plugs for them, my friend.
[00:21:11.613 --> 00:21:12.794]  The worst, I mean it.
[00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:16.716]  I always hear people as well, I call up, and they want to know what they can do.
[00:21:16.796 --> 00:21:17.896]  They know what's going on.
[00:21:17.937 --> 00:21:26.801]  They understand the problem that we're facing with all of the tyranny, the oppression.
[00:21:26.841 --> 00:21:27.522]  What can I do?
[00:21:27.702 --> 00:21:29.143]  I'm just a regular person.
[00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.065]  Everybody should be brushing their teeth.
[00:21:32.145 --> 00:21:35.267]  So, I mean, you can buy a toothpaste.
[00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:37.929]  Everybody drinks coffee in the morning.
[00:21:38.049 --> 00:21:43.073]  Buy coffee from Infowars and bring money into this operation.
[00:21:43.313 --> 00:21:51.098]  We're able to pay the bills right now, but I want to expand and I want to really give them a run for their money in 2020 because I think you can see it's all on the line here.
