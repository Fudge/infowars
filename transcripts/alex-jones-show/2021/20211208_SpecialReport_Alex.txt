[00:00:00.249 --> 00:00:07.134]  If you were teleported back in time 250 years ago, would you have taken part in the American Revolution?
[00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:10.936]  Well, I'm asking you that same question today.
[00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:12.998]  We're not engaged in a revolution.
[00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:21.103]  We're engaged in the defense of our Republic against a globalist corporate revolution of the elite against we the people.
[00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:23.244]  This is an attack on the Renaissance.
[00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:25.746]  This is an attack on humanity and free will.
[00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:28.087]  This is an attack on our very lives.
[00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:31.689]  That's why we've launched 1776coin.com.
[00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:41.573]  It's not just an amazing limited edition coin, but it will also fund the next move, the next phase in the resistance to the globalist tyranny.
[00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:44.114]  You may have heard of the legend of St.
[00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:45.394]  George slaying the dragon.
[00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:46.495]  St.
[00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:51.757]  George stands for the courage to face adversity in order to defend the innocent.
[00:00:52.884 --> 00:00:55.626]  The triumph of good over evil for centuries.
[00:00:57.107 --> 00:00:57.367]  St.
[00:00:57.468 --> 00:01:06.214]  George represented the idea of courageous leadership and with it the underlying popular will to be governed well and protected.
[00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:19.204]  On the obverse of each one ounce 1776 founding member silver round you will see a rendition of George Washington slaying the dragon and the Latin inscription Sic Semper Tyrannis.
[00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:27.980]   Sic Semper Tyrannis literally translates as thus always to tyrants. A tyrant by definition is a ruler
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.140]   who arbitrarily and unjustly wields power to oppress the citizenry.
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.849]   The idea is that a tyrant will surely meet a dire end. Our rendition of George Washington slaying the
[00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:44.539]   dragon represents victory over tyranny. On the reverse
[00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:52.340]   of each one ounce 1776 founding member silver coin you will see a rendition of an American eagle with the
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.900]   inscription 1776 above its head
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.099]  and a globe at its feet.
[00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.658]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:57.362 --> 00:01:59.463]  The American Eagle represents freedom.
[00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:05.525]  The founding fathers made an appropriate choice when they selected the bald eagle as the emblem of the nation.
[00:02:06.046 --> 00:02:12.448]  The fierce beauty and proud independence of this great bird amply symbolizes the strength and freedom of America.
[00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:21.154]  The globe represents the world, with North America centered, representing our strategic value and symbol of freedom to the entire world.
