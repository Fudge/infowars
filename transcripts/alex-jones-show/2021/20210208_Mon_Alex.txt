[00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.311]  Guaranteed.
[00:00:01.331 --> 00:00:03.194]  100% confirmed.
[00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:04.997]  They've done it before.
[00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:06.319]  They stand to gain from it.
[00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:07.461]  They have a history of doing it.
[00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:08.522]  They have the means.
[00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:09.644]  They have the motive.
[00:00:10.632 --> 00:00:31.047]  And they are now pre-programming at a level I haven't ever seen, even before 9-11, even before Oklahoma City, even before other events, that right-wingers are going to engage in terror attacks, mass shootings, bombings everywhere, and that anyone that's pro-America, or anyone that's pro-gun, or anyone that's pro-life is a terrorist.
[00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:34.790]  And they're going to try to get the general public then en masse
[00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:47.156]  The same ones that wear the mask, the same ones that do what they're told, to then literally, in a Maoist revolution, not work with us, not talk to us, and actually physically attack us.
[00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:49.158]  And they've already beta tested the whole thing.
[00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.361]  They're pre-programming the false flags.
[00:00:53.643 --> 00:01:03.090]  They're saying they're coming, so when they do come, when the attacks come, everyone is already pre-programmed to say it's gun owners, it's veterans, it's conservatives, we've got to have a massive purge.
[00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.817]  They're on the LA Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, The View saying, arrest them and put them in re-education camps.
[00:01:13.278 --> 00:01:18.442]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:22.161]  Okay.
[00:01:22.422 --> 00:01:31.028]  I tend to get up here on air and get really excited and cover a lot of news and still kind of not get to all the points I really want to break down.
[00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:38.813]  So I'm going to try my best here today to just be calm and we'll see how long that lasts and just cover all of this.
[00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:48.540]  But it is becoming extremely, extremely clear exactly what is going on and what is unfolding.
[00:01:51.411 --> 00:02:02.155]  Now... Let me just... I can't do the show right now.
[00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:02.975]  I just can't do it.
[00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:04.055]  I gotta reset.
[00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:05.216]  I gotta go rebroadcast.
[00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:08.397]  I mean, this is all just too heavy.
[00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:09.397]  This is all too insane.
[00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:10.377]  This is all too serious.
[00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:14.479]  And I just need people to know that this is not a game, okay?
[00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.139]  I mean, I knew that the Globalists were coming.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.360]  I knew they were setting all this up.
[00:02:20.177 --> 00:02:30.839]  Everything was in beta test, but we're now actually in the jaws of this and it's going to get a lot worse a lot quicker until humanity gets serious and realizes they're under attack.
[00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.600]  You've got to get out of the comfort zone and out of the apathy.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:44.202]  I know this audience understands that but we've got to shake other people out of it to how much danger they're in because people can be trained by increments like the bowling frog in the pot.
[00:02:44.702 --> 00:02:47.143]  That's the most important analogy ever to fry.
[00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:51.857]  And I, quite frankly, am not even angry anymore.
[00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:53.899]  I'm not even disgusted anymore.
[00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.760]  I am not even horrified of the new world order.
[00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.422]  I am just absolutely saddened by it.
[00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:04.005]  And by the slaves of the system that go along with it all.
[00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:07.988]  Wow, there's just such incredible news here today.
[00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.672]  The Super Bowl was an amazing parallel of reality versus fiction.
[00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.513]  Of the globalists trying to force-feed their lies versus what the public actually wants.
[00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:20.894]  We're going to break that down today.
[00:03:22.676 --> 00:03:25.297]  We also have the trial of Trump beginning tomorrow.
[00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:33.763]  It was going to start today, but they're sparring over how they're going to try to destroy Trump with Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer.
[00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:38.767]  We're going to be laying all of that out for you.
[00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:42.590]  Maxine Waters is now going further than even
[00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:50.718]  Nadler did and saying that there is no violence ever called for by Democrats.
[00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:51.958]  Antifa doesn't exist.
[00:03:52.659 --> 00:04:00.182]  And she never called for any type of aggression towards people because Trump's lawyers are set to start playing videos of them all calling for violence.
[00:04:01.163 --> 00:04:03.364]  So that is all coming up.
[00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:10.047]  And then the really big story is something that I've worked on Saturday and Sunday
[00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:14.530]  With Greg Reese.
[00:04:17.532 --> 00:04:24.617]  And that is a report we're gonna premiere at 1.30 today.
[00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:25.878]  He's not done with it yet.
[00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:27.399]  A lot of work's gone into this.
[00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:29.101]  It's only gonna be seven minutes long.
[00:04:30.362 --> 00:04:31.703]  And it tells you everything.
[00:04:31.983 --> 00:04:33.684]  It is powerful.
[00:04:34.244 --> 00:04:37.867]  And I don't even know what to call this, other than a serious warning.
[00:04:39.588 --> 00:04:41.310]  An emergency transmission.
[00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:50.649]  And it ties into the headline for the live show today, that's on InfoWars.com, that we're in an emergency alert?
[00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:59.662]  And that the globalists are planning massive false flags to be blamed on the American people and to bring in a Soviet-style system.
[00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:01.143]  There's the actual headline.
[00:05:01.163 --> 00:05:01.903]  Emergency alert.
[00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:06.426]  Globalists preparing massive false flags as pretext for Soviet-style purge.
[00:05:07.126 --> 00:05:07.706]  Watch live.
[00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:13.749]  And I'm going to talk about a lot of this on the show today, but Jay Dyer is going to be in studio with us.
[00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.990]  He's a great author and researcher and knows his stuff.
[00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:17.591]  He's done
[00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:30.207]  More deep research on the globalist endgame than even I have, because I did most of my research 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago, because I already know their operation.
[00:05:30.227 --> 00:05:35.709]  But he studies it going back as well, hundreds of years, but then on their current stuff.
[00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:52.192]  So I kind of use him as a reader's digest with his show, the things he does, to go hear him boil down these books he's reading, like everyday new ones, where they're going to just tear us apart and put us in camps and brain damage us and sterilize us, and they're just foaming at the mouth like satanic piranhas.
[00:05:53.172 --> 00:05:56.813]  It's hard for me to read their stuff, but he does it and then boils it down.
[00:05:57.313 --> 00:06:00.434]  He's going to be in studio, and while he's on with us, he'll also host the fourth hour.
[00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:06.537]  I'm going to play this report where they're coming for you and your family in their words.
[00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:07.984]  They're coming for you and your family.
[00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:16.356]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this February 8th, 2021 transmission.
[00:06:17.156 --> 00:06:35.029]  And I'm going to lay out today for you the proof of the mass persecution of patriots of the American people, the plan for massive false flags across the country, and then the plans to begin then moving against the population, not just of this country, but of the world.
[00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:38.132]  And so that is all coming up today.
[00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:40.093]  Jay Dyer is going to be in studio.
[00:06:40.573 --> 00:06:43.934]  The trial of the president has begun.
[00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:51.675]  They are just doing the preliminaries right now for sedition, when this is everything the globalists have actually engaged in against our country.
[00:06:52.595 --> 00:07:01.177]  We also have the climate czar saying that their game plan is to, quote, break the American people's will, including, quote, the old retiree down the street from you.
[00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:05.826]  Yes, this is all a giant open-air re-education camp.
[00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:13.429]  Also, more massive evidence of planned, coordinated, proven, documented election fraud coming out.
[00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.150]  And so much more.
[00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:22.972]  I'll be breaking down the Super Bowl, the incredible propaganda there versus Tom Brady not wearing the mask and all the rest of it.
[00:07:23.012 --> 00:07:23.772]  True leadership.
[00:07:24.412 --> 00:07:26.593]  But first, a very important report.
[00:07:28.193 --> 00:07:29.574]  A very important report.
[00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:48.173]  Green reveals a tyrannical double standard, and this doesn't just go from Green, Congresswoman Green, it extends to President Trump, you and I, and all of us, and it is President Trump that is on trial, but it's really the American people that are on trial as they cast us and frame us as the terrorists.
[00:07:48.493 --> 00:07:50.513]  Here is the report posted at Bandot Video.
[00:07:50.593 --> 00:07:55.434]  Marjorie Taylor Green represents Georgia's 14th congressional district.
[00:07:55.734 --> 00:07:57.994]  I'm Marjorie Green and I approve this ad.
[00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:00.275]  I'm running to stop gun control.
[00:08:03.493 --> 00:08:06.796]  Open borders.
[00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:12.700]  The Green New Deal.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.662]  And socialism.
[00:08:14.782 --> 00:08:33.216]  But before she had even taken her freshman oath, she faced cancellation from a left mad with power and political paranoia, using her as an example to eventually cancel the entire GOP in order to further the authoritarian socialist government the left is obsessed with becoming.
[00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:37.719]  The Republicans truly have lost their way.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.121]  Their party is destroyed.
[00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:44.084]  Their base now is conspiracy theorists.
[00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:45.465]  It's cowards.
[00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:46.867]  It's opportunists.
[00:08:47.507 --> 00:08:48.448]  It's grifters.
[00:08:48.808 --> 00:08:52.251]  And sadly, they're becoming the Looney Tunes.
[00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:56.154]  You know, these are people who we can't take serious.
[00:08:56.434 --> 00:09:07.445]  Now Greene has had her House Education and Labor Committee position stripped after an epic display of hypocrisy and the power to rush and crush the process of legislature.
[00:09:07.745 --> 00:09:10.828]  Removing Congresswoman Greene is the right thing to do now.
[00:09:12.229 --> 00:09:17.655]  And I regret that we are going to have to do it to the Rules Committee rather than the party leadership level.
[00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.152]  Nonetheless, we are going to do this.
[00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:25.296]  The appropriate action is for the Ethics Commission to look at this and that's how we should proceed.
[00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:35.126]  A contentious, politically driven resolution that was assigned to our committee and will now be on the House floor without proper consideration by the Ethics Committee.
[00:09:35.907 --> 00:09:36.647]  What are we doing?
[00:09:37.008 --> 00:09:43.394]  Shouldn't members have allowed Greene's rhetoric to play out during her term that was voted on by her constituents?
[00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:54.003]  What you need to know about me is I'm a very regular American, just like the people I represent in my district and most people across the country.
[00:09:54.383 --> 00:09:58.465]  I never once said during my entire campaign, QAnon.
[00:09:58.845 --> 00:10:04.948]  I never once said any of the things that I am being accused of today during my campaign.
[00:10:05.348 --> 00:10:10.011]  I never said any of these things since I have been elected for Congress.
[00:10:10.811 --> 00:10:15.093]  These were words of the past and these things do not represent me.
[00:10:15.493 --> 00:10:19.935]  They do not represent my district and they do not represent my values.
[00:10:20.495 --> 00:10:28.099]  Will we allow the media that is just as guilty as QAnon of presenting truth and lies to divide us?
[00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:36.702]  To equate the media to QAnon is beyond the pale.
[00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:39.704]  Whoever has the power makes the rules.
[00:10:40.523 --> 00:10:42.565]  Whoever makes the rules makes them in their favor.
[00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:50.831]  And you have another resolution that you haven't discussed yet to remove over a hundred Republican members of Congress, including six from my home state of Georgia.
[00:10:51.372 --> 00:10:52.052]  Who's next?
[00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:54.134]  Who is next?
[00:10:54.594 --> 00:10:56.716]  Everyone has said things they wish they didn't say.
[00:10:56.816 --> 00:10:59.038]  Everyone has done things they wish they didn't do.
[00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:00.799]  So who's next?
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.982]  Who will the cancel culture attack next?
[00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:09.927]  And of course, everyone wants to know, where are the votes to hold AOC accountable for her lies?
[00:11:10.484 --> 00:11:16.367]  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has given a harrowing account of her experience on January 6th.
[00:11:16.487 --> 00:11:20.129]  A harrowing and emotional account of what happened to her during the Capitol riot.
[00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:23.730]  It's one of the most harrowing accounts so far.
[00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.132]  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, tell that harrowing story.
[00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:30.894]  The harrowing story of how she hid from attackers during the Capitol riot.
[00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:32.621]  Boom.
[00:11:33.322 --> 00:11:33.682]  Boom.
[00:11:34.122 --> 00:11:36.384]  Disclosing new harrowing details.
[00:11:36.484 --> 00:11:42.208]  You actually said that the problem with the story is that the rioters didn't storm the building in question.
[00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:45.390]  Insurrectionists never stormed our hallway.
[00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.671]  Sorry, say that.
[00:11:48.952 --> 00:11:50.232]  They didn't get anywhere near us.
[00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:57.454]  Or Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar for their anti-Semitism and seething disdain for American values.
[00:11:57.594 --> 00:11:59.075]  They're trying to say it's anti-Semitism.
[00:11:59.115 --> 00:12:05.476]  That's the way they're trying to discredit the fact that we all know, under Netanyahu's regime, human rights violations have gotten worse.
[00:12:05.896 --> 00:12:08.377]  And we need to be able to use... Why not boycott Egypt?
[00:12:08.797 --> 00:12:16.159]  Representative Omar embodies a vile, hate-filled, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bigotry.
[00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:20.029]  I always say America does not suffer from scarcity.
[00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:21.830]  We suffer from greed.
[00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.772]  Or Maxine Waters for her calls for violence.
[00:12:25.952 --> 00:12:45.724]  That if a Democrat ever promoted violence or associated themselves with sentiments encouraging violence against other Americans or Republicans or presidents and individuals who are serving, that she would be the first person to kick them off of
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.542]  Their committees, and I will join her in that regard.
[00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:13.908]  And of course the lying president said that I had threatened all of his constituents.
[00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:17.510]  I did not threaten his constituents, his supporters.
[00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.371]  I do that all the time, but I didn't do it that time.
[00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:31.315]  Eleven Stockholm Syndrome-suffering Republicans voted to fuel the radical left's version of Greene's statements as they could best spin them.
[00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:34.819]  This is an AR-15 in the hands of Ms.
[00:13:34.859 --> 00:13:35.119]  Greene.
[00:13:36.261 --> 00:13:37.602]  This was on Facebook.
[00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:39.613]  Just a few months ago.
[00:13:39.853 --> 00:13:50.797]  When the Democrats and 11 of my Republican colleagues decided to strip me of my committee assignments, education and labor, and the budget committee, you know what they did?
[00:13:51.437 --> 00:13:54.518]  They actually stripped my district of their voice.
[00:13:54.758 --> 00:14:00.500]  Whether you disagree with Green's statements, her punishment, and the witch trial is moot.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:09.663]  A double standard is being fortified, hurtling the Democrats and their country club GOP cohorts towards their tyrannical endgame.
[00:14:10.063 --> 00:14:11.244]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:14:12.546 --> 00:14:14.507]  Green reveals a tyrannical double standard.
[00:14:14.527 --> 00:14:17.648]  That's in the John Bounds section of Band.Video.
[00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:18.709]  Click the left-hand corner.
[00:14:19.349 --> 00:14:20.850]  You go down and find his latest reports.
[00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.731]  That thing needs to get a million views.
[00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:23.991]  It needs to get 10 million views.
[00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:29.013]  But the only way we get outside of the censorship cage is when you release the Kraken.
[00:14:29.314 --> 00:14:34.876]  When you go to Band.Video and you find the articles and the videos, the information you think is most important and you share it, it changes the world.
[00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:36.397]  How rich is that?
[00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:44.804]  Incredible inversion of reality to have Ilhan Omar, the biggest grifter ever, $2 million last year to her husband of campaign money.
[00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:46.226]  The list goes on and on.
[00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:47.247]  Married to her brother.
[00:14:48.528 --> 00:14:49.749]  Just a total fraudster.
[00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.093]  Witnesses saying that they ordered them under threat of violence to vote for her.
[00:14:54.433 --> 00:14:56.495]  Total Sharia law she's putting in Minnesota.
[00:14:57.696 --> 00:15:01.219]  And then she says that Congresswoman Greene is a grifter.
[00:15:02.051 --> 00:15:04.752]  Congresswoman Greene, she's a globalist takeover.
[00:15:05.332 --> 00:15:08.273]  And yeah, she shared a few QAnon things and now she's been set up by it.
[00:15:09.013 --> 00:15:11.354]  All the real stuff against the globalists now called QAnon.
[00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:13.715]  That's how it was all set up.
[00:15:14.255 --> 00:15:20.657]  To put dates on things and to add disinfo to discredit our liberty movement taking over Congress.
[00:15:20.677 --> 00:15:21.377]  But it's going to fail.
[00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.959]  We were able to minimize Q to a great extent before they could totally
[00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:30.946]  Set people up with false flag attacks, which I'm going to cover next when we come back.
[00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:32.646]  That's what the globals are planning next.
[00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.367]  Mark your words.
[00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:35.167]  Mark my words.
[00:15:36.448 --> 00:15:51.212]  I was sitting around on January 8th, the day after I'd gotten back from D.C., talking to some of the crew, and they said, well, you know, Trump has given his concession speech, and he's going to step down.
[00:15:51.292 --> 00:15:51.872]  And I said, yeah.
[00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:54.993]  I made some calls to Trump's lawyers and confirmed that that was the plan.
[00:15:56.317 --> 00:16:00.079]  And I said, yeah, when I go on air tomorrow and tell everybody this, some of them aren't going to believe me.
[00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:02.840]  They're just going to think that I'm being negative in a bad sport.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.821]  And it made a lot of the listeners mad.
[00:16:04.841 --> 00:16:06.401]  In fact, we lost a lot of listeners.
[00:16:06.421 --> 00:16:08.782]  It was all over the website, all over the comments.
[00:16:08.863 --> 00:16:09.963]  Hey, you're done, buddy.
[00:16:09.983 --> 00:16:10.863]  You're not on the team.
[00:16:11.944 --> 00:16:12.764]  Trump's invincible.
[00:16:12.864 --> 00:16:13.765]  Q's invincible.
[00:16:13.845 --> 00:16:14.945]  You're a fed.
[00:16:14.965 --> 00:16:21.128]  And meanwhile, I'm talking to Roger Stone that talks to Trump every day, and I'm talking to Trump's lawyers.
[00:16:22.412 --> 00:16:23.893]  And I've missed calls from Trump.
[00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.474]  Not bragging, it doesn't matter to me.
[00:16:25.754 --> 00:16:27.935]  I've been targeted because Trump likes me and listens.
[00:16:28.996 --> 00:16:29.556]  Don Jr.
[00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:29.977]  listens.
[00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:30.717]  Don Jr.
[00:16:31.337 --> 00:16:32.038]  is in contact.
[00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:32.698]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:16:33.058 --> 00:16:34.980]  So I'm in real contact with these people.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.841]  And I know what's going on.
[00:16:40.663 --> 00:16:45.766]  And we're all being set up together and I can't get 30% of my own listeners to believe me.
[00:16:47.647 --> 00:16:50.249]  So, that's what I'm telling the listeners is,
[00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:53.491]  Let's move on from that.
[00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:58.836]  But I've heard from so many people, hey, why are you talking about Q so much?
[00:16:59.657 --> 00:17:09.724]  Because they're gonna use it with disinfo and the disinfo that was put out to discredit anyone that exposes world government, the pedophile rings, the globalist, everything.
[00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:22.634]  They can connect it to that because Q became the leader of everything because the media at first and big tech at first for three years promoted it and pumped it and allowed it to grow while censoring everybody else that was telling the truth.
[00:17:23.769 --> 00:17:40.582]  Now, as soon as they were ready to take Q down and the Q movement, they started censoring it and knocking out the networks because once you knew you'd been had, they didn't want all those Q networks with millions of followers on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube to be able to keep communicating.
[00:17:43.304 --> 00:17:52.591]  And so all those overnight Q stars that had hundreds of thousands and millions of followers, they were all shut down because they had already fulfilled their usefulness.
[00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:55.957]  How do you discredit a global awakening of the New World Order?
[00:17:56.978 --> 00:18:04.103]  How do you discredit an awakening to the IMF and World Bank and the Great Reset and Bill Gates and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds?
[00:18:04.163 --> 00:18:15.412]  How do you deal with the UN plan to flood the borders and open up the planet under UN control to create a giant third world mass under a tiny elite's domination?
[00:18:16.472 --> 00:18:19.595]  You lead the opposition from a shadowy, esoteric group
[00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:26.753]  That gives out fake dates and fake info mixed with real info to discredit it.
[00:18:28.495 --> 00:18:39.884]  And so I'm going to get to the big news next segment, but I just want to spend some time on this segment telling you that what I'm going to lay out is going to happen.
[00:18:43.988 --> 00:18:47.911]  Unless we have a massive awakening and basically have a giant
[00:18:50.555 --> 00:18:51.396]  We're good to go.
[00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:06.514]  To come together of every race, color, and creed to oppose this globalist operation.
[00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:08.196]  We have to get organized.
[00:19:08.216 --> 00:19:09.577]  We have to get up front.
[00:19:09.957 --> 00:19:11.278]  We have to get aggressive.
[00:19:11.399 --> 00:19:25.331]  And when the Nadlers of the world say, oh, there is no world government, there is no New World Order, there are no COVID emergency centers, there is no forced inoculation, there is no Antifa,
[00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:29.302]  We have to not even engage in a debate with these criminals.
[00:19:29.582 --> 00:19:33.003]  We have to move forward to strip them of their committee chairmanships.
[00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:35.904]  We have to move forward to defeat them in the elections.
[00:19:36.164 --> 00:19:37.384]  We have to sue them.
[00:19:37.684 --> 00:19:39.285]  We have to go protest them.
[00:19:39.525 --> 00:19:42.505]  We have to get on the offense against this scum.
[00:19:42.705 --> 00:19:46.246]  And they're all a pack of hunchback devils with no power.
[00:19:46.406 --> 00:19:47.547]  That's why they seek power.
[00:19:48.067 --> 00:19:55.209]  But we lay down and keep letting them dominate us when they are the most immoral, disgusting, degenerate people on the planet.
[00:19:57.096 --> 00:20:00.797]  And so you either stand against these people or they will rape you.
[00:20:01.097 --> 00:20:01.877]  It's who they are.
[00:20:02.238 --> 00:20:11.740]  They want to hurt you because they hate themselves and they are projecting the Union psychology of the shadow onto you, period.
[00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:15.161]  You think Maxine Waters likes her evil, ugly ass?
[00:20:15.221 --> 00:20:15.362]  No.
[00:20:18.004 --> 00:20:19.685]  Nadler likes his evil, ugly ass?
[00:20:19.745 --> 00:20:20.005]  No.
[00:20:20.825 --> 00:20:22.906]  You think Hillary likes her evil, twisted butt?
[00:20:23.006 --> 00:20:23.246]  No.
[00:20:23.947 --> 00:20:29.990]  But she projects it on you because these people are not retrospective and they cannot look within themselves.
[00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:36.893]  Knowing thyself is the highest order.
[00:20:37.233 --> 00:20:39.474]  Then you can know God once you know yourself.
[00:20:40.895 --> 00:20:43.276]  But if you don't know yourself, you don't know anything.
[00:20:44.836 --> 00:20:45.937]  Know thyself first!
[00:20:48.763 --> 00:20:50.404]  These people do not know who they are.
[00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:52.566]  They don't even know where they came from or where they're going.
[00:20:52.827 --> 00:20:55.709]  They just want to pull down everything good.
[00:20:57.551 --> 00:21:03.036]  So just as night follows day and day follows night, they are preparing massive false flags in this country.
[00:21:04.383 --> 00:21:09.949]  To blame us, and they're going to try to move against us, and they're going to do it because they never got in trouble for all the things they did before.
[00:21:10.329 --> 00:21:21.621]  Because the corrupt lawyer-run Justice Department is so full of pedophiles and corrupt people, they literally existentially want to make a run at the American gun owner and the American Christian, and they're going to do it.
[00:21:22.202 --> 00:21:24.803]  But they're going to do it first through psychological operations.
[00:21:24.903 --> 00:21:26.023]  And it's going to be bad.
[00:21:26.463 --> 00:21:27.324]  It's going to be rough.
[00:21:27.844 --> 00:21:29.645]  And you better get yourselves ready for it.
[00:21:29.885 --> 00:21:33.586]  And you better know what the different scenarios are that are going to unfold out of this.
[00:21:33.866 --> 00:21:35.106]  And I'll cover it all when we come back.
[00:21:36.707 --> 00:21:40.768]  Separately, we're not going to be on the air unless we have your support.
[00:21:40.928 --> 00:21:44.229]  Plus, we've got great products that everybody already needs.
[00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.130]  It's been sold out for a while.
[00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:51.232]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 and vitamin K for your immunity and for your body's defenses.
[00:21:52.372 --> 00:21:55.579]  It's something that's essential that everyone needs regardless.
[00:21:57.403 --> 00:21:59.788]  The globalists don't want you knowing how to protect yourself.
[00:21:59.868 --> 00:22:00.950]  A limited supply.
[00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:08.277]  A limited supply, because they can't get the bottles or the caps, they may have to change the packaging, has come in.
[00:22:08.297 --> 00:22:11.118]  It'll probably be sold out in a week at the amount we have.
[00:22:11.438 --> 00:22:13.678]  Despite that, it's 25% off.
[00:22:13.878 --> 00:22:15.399]  You take it sublingually, under the tongue.
[00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:18.960]  A lot of people, especially older folks, cannot absorb D3 in the gut.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:25.222]  But under the tongue, if you hold it for about a minute, you get most of it, along with the vitamin K that helps with the delivery.
[00:22:26.033 --> 00:22:28.214]  Ultra high quality back in stock.
[00:22:28.234 --> 00:22:37.079]  You can get it for 40% off when you get it with Ultra 12 super high end vitamin B12 under the tongue for maximum absorption as well.
[00:22:37.619 --> 00:22:38.820]  Made by the same great lab.
[00:22:39.601 --> 00:22:40.741]  The highest in we can get.
[00:22:41.602 --> 00:22:42.382]  I'm so proud of it.
[00:22:42.842 --> 00:22:47.585]  Ultra 12 with it is 40% off in the combo pack.
[00:22:48.045 --> 00:22:49.566]  Get Ultra 12 by itself.
[00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:52.808]  Because there's no shortage of that yet.
[00:22:54.011 --> 00:22:58.655]  For 50% off Ultra 12 50% off by itself when her son.
[00:22:58.675 --> 00:23:01.017]  25% by itself.
[00:23:01.037 --> 00:23:04.660]  The two in a combo 40% off no reviews on that.
[00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:12.988]  It's a brand new combo, but look at the reviews of Ultra 12 and when her son by itself 9899% thousands upon thousands of reviews.
[00:23:13.528 --> 00:23:17.412]  I can tell you this is made by the top lab in the country 4.9 stars.
[00:23:19.963 --> 00:23:20.805]  Limited supply.
[00:23:21.446 --> 00:23:27.640]  Separately, my dad, working with a major manufacturer, major developer, and a chemist.
[00:23:29.468 --> 00:23:32.770]  Has launched his own line that we carry at mfowarstore.com.
[00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.910]  And these are all different formulas.
[00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.311]  It doesn't compete with Supermelt Vitality or Alpha Power.
[00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:37.812]  It's just different and it's really strong.
[00:23:38.472 --> 00:23:42.614]  Total Male Invigoration Primal Youth available.
[00:23:42.954 --> 00:23:50.218]  Primal Youth along with the Extra Strength Kava Gel from Dr. Jones Naturals at mfowarstore.com.
[00:23:50.258 --> 00:23:52.159]  That's mfowarstore.com.
[00:23:52.199 --> 00:23:56.801]  Or find that and other products at Dr. Jones Naturals, drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:23:57.441 --> 00:24:03.023]  You know, the Democratic Party filed more than 50 lawsuits against me trying to shut us down the last four years.
[00:24:03.803 --> 00:24:06.224]  Since Trump got elected, they filed thousands on him.
[00:24:06.644 --> 00:24:07.644]  Literally over a thousand.
[00:24:09.405 --> 00:24:11.045]  They always ask, who runs you?
[00:24:11.105 --> 00:24:12.405]  Who tells you what to say?
[00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:13.646]  Where do you come up with all this?
[00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:26.575]  And it's from research and history and my own moral compass and also what I as a human think that I then tell you from my own perspective and that is very effective with people because it's real.
[00:24:26.895 --> 00:24:32.040]  It's not a produced talking point by a committee of corporate lawyers and psychologists.
[00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:37.644]  And that's why I'm going to begin this critical information by talking about something personal.
[00:24:38.425 --> 00:24:39.566]  How I have gone through this.
[00:24:40.934 --> 00:24:51.664]  I understand why a lot of people wanted to believe that Trump was invincible, and there was a secret group, and Bill Barr was good, and Sessions was good, and the world was good, and we were going to fix it all.
[00:24:53.305 --> 00:24:59.251]  And they created a cartoon version of what was really happening to discredit anybody investigating the real evil.
[00:25:00.031 --> 00:25:03.694]  So it's those that did this that are the bad guys, not those of you that took the bait.
[00:25:04.557 --> 00:25:05.418]  I'm not putting you down.
[00:25:05.478 --> 00:25:06.338]  I'm sad about this.
[00:25:06.858 --> 00:25:08.019]  I've been through similar things.
[00:25:08.139 --> 00:25:09.400]  I've been conned before as well.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.181]  This isn't my first rodeo.
[00:25:13.823 --> 00:25:15.264]  So don't get out of the Liberty Movement.
[00:25:15.304 --> 00:25:21.968]  Don't get out of the fight against the globalists just because you thought we were all invincible and everything was okay and you were on a bandwagon with a winning team.
[00:25:23.489 --> 00:25:24.910]  You are on a bandwagon with a winning team.
[00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:25.450]  With God.
[00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.390]  And with justice.
[00:25:26.471 --> 00:25:27.151]  And with what's right.
[00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:31.954]  Because this whole world, this whole life is an experience and a test of who you are.
[00:25:32.754 --> 00:25:33.355]  That's a fact.
[00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.610]  So be in the world, but not of the world.
[00:25:38.911 --> 00:25:46.853]  And so I remember on that same conversation on January 8th with some of my crew, some of the managers, they said, well, don't be too down, Alex.
[00:25:48.394 --> 00:25:53.795]  You know, once Trump's out and everybody doesn't think everything's fine, we'll have even more listeners because people are going to hate Biden.
[00:25:54.795 --> 00:25:56.336]  And I said, you mark my words.
[00:25:56.956 --> 00:26:00.377]  As soon as that inauguration's over and Biden's sworn in up there,
[00:26:04.073 --> 00:26:08.697]  People are actually going to give up and they're going to actually fall away to a great extent.
[00:26:08.717 --> 00:26:13.941]  But that's okay, because we've got a bigger number than we had 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago, or even five years ago.
[00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:17.984]  But all the Sunshine Patriots aren't winter soldiers.
[00:26:18.045 --> 00:26:19.406]  They're not going to be involved.
[00:26:19.946 --> 00:26:23.489]  They wanted to be part of the fantasy.
[00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:25.711]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:26:26.191 --> 00:26:28.393]  Once you see the Matrix, you can't go back.
[00:26:28.513 --> 00:26:33.097]  And once you see the false liberty movement, you're not going to get conned again for most people.
[00:26:35.009 --> 00:26:36.630]  So let me hit the big news for you right now.
[00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:39.492]  Now, what I'm saying is incredibly simple.
[00:26:39.612 --> 00:26:44.936]  What I'm saying, almost all of you already know, and you're gonna say, Jones, why are you telling us that grass is green, the sky is blue?
[00:26:47.858 --> 00:26:49.579]  And that milk cows got black and white spots?
[00:26:49.959 --> 00:26:54.302]  I mean, or fire hydrants are yellow and fire engines are red.
[00:26:54.342 --> 00:26:56.183]  I mean, why are you telling us bluebirds are blue?
[00:26:59.645 --> 00:27:00.346]  Why are you doing this?
[00:27:02.534 --> 00:27:04.197]  Because I'm not talking to you, remember that.
[00:27:04.658 --> 00:27:08.807]  This is not a regular show that's just meant to entertain an audience over and over again.
[00:27:08.847 --> 00:27:12.514]  It's about getting you motivated to take action to go out and wake others up.
[00:27:13.482 --> 00:27:14.863]  It's about your leadership role.
[00:27:14.903 --> 00:27:16.745]  It's about getting you ready to take action.
[00:27:17.065 --> 00:27:21.148]  It's about you having confidence in yourself and having the information it takes to defeat the globalists.
[00:27:21.328 --> 00:27:22.929]  They've organized their people against us.
[00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.472]  They have a huge Time Magazine article bragging how they stole the election.
[00:27:27.293 --> 00:27:33.938]  How a powerful cabal of bankers and foreign banks helped silence the American people and helped install Joe Biden.
[00:27:36.561 --> 00:27:45.648]  But we have people power, and we have common sense, and we're going to win if you simply understand that you can't count on some foggy secret group doing it.
[00:27:45.788 --> 00:27:47.430]  You have to get engaged yourself.
[00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.811]  Because the foggy secret group is the globalists.
[00:27:50.172 --> 00:27:51.193]  It's the establishment.
[00:27:51.673 --> 00:27:52.774]  They operate in the dark.
[00:27:52.874 --> 00:27:53.995]  We operate out in the light.
[00:27:56.732 --> 00:27:59.033]  So when I say this, you're going to say, Jones, I already know that.
[00:27:59.113 --> 00:28:01.093]  OK, well, what are you going to do about it?
[00:28:01.173 --> 00:28:03.154]  And I'm not saying that like, oh, you're dumb.
[00:28:03.534 --> 00:28:04.574]  I want to have a discussion.
[00:28:04.874 --> 00:28:05.734]  I want to have a debate.
[00:28:05.874 --> 00:28:06.835]  I want to mobilize.
[00:28:07.155 --> 00:28:11.956]  I want to see the different ways you peacefully fight this to find out what's the most successful action.
[00:28:12.496 --> 00:28:19.158]  I got a lot of ideas myself, but I really respect the grassroots ingenuity of the crowd.
[00:28:20.318 --> 00:28:25.900]  Of old people, of young people, of white people, of black people, of brown people, of everybody that wants to be free.
[00:28:27.588 --> 00:28:28.209]  And so here it is.
[00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:29.110]  I'm going to lay it out now.
[00:28:30.912 --> 00:28:31.773]  Guaranteed.
[00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:33.656]  100% confirmed.
[00:28:34.417 --> 00:28:35.438]  They've done it before.
[00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:36.760]  They stand to gain from it.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.901]  They have a history of doing it.
[00:28:38.182 --> 00:28:38.963]  They have the means.
[00:28:39.323 --> 00:28:40.084]  They have the motive.
[00:28:41.075 --> 00:29:01.441]  And they are now pre-programming at a level I haven't ever seen, even before 9-11, even before Oklahoma City, even before other events, that right-wingers are going to engage in terror attacks, mass shootings, bombings everywhere, and that anyone that's pro-America, or anyone that's pro-gun, or anyone that's pro-life is a terrorist.
[00:29:08.837 --> 00:29:24.211]  And they're going to try to get the general public then en masse, the same ones that wear the mask, the same ones that do what they're told, to then literally, in a Maoist revolution, not work with us, not talk to us, and actually physically attack us.
[00:29:24.571 --> 00:29:26.193]  And they've already beta tested the whole thing.
[00:29:27.622 --> 00:29:30.443]  They didn't need to have thousands of Trump supporters that went to D.C.
[00:29:30.463 --> 00:29:33.884]  peacefully to protest the election fraud, to be kicked off airlines.
[00:29:34.104 --> 00:29:37.645]  The airline employees would check and see if you'd just flown to D.C.
[00:29:37.905 --> 00:29:40.866]  and if you were wearing a MAGA hat, they would kick you off the flight.
[00:29:42.487 --> 00:29:49.949]  They didn't need to call the FBI and have Bank of America spy on all their customers to see who'd gone to D.C.
[00:29:50.189 --> 00:29:51.449]  and report them to the FBI.
[00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:52.770]  Bank of America did it on its own.
[00:29:53.735 --> 00:30:02.360]  This is corporate fascism using a Maoist communist model of the Cultural Revolution against the people.
[00:30:04.581 --> 00:30:05.462]  Now here's what you need to know.
[00:30:05.502 --> 00:30:07.463]  This is the most important point with all of this.
[00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:11.125]  They're pre-programming the false flags.
[00:30:13.404 --> 00:30:22.854]  They're saying they're coming, so when they do come, when the attacks come, everyone is already pre-programmed to say it's gun owners, it's veterans, it's conservatives, we've got to have a massive purge.
[00:30:23.294 --> 00:30:32.544]  They're on the LA Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, The View, saying, arrest them and put them in re-education camps.
[00:30:34.602 --> 00:30:43.726]  There are now Biden administration officials saying it's time to put conservatives in camps like the Japanese in World War II.
[00:30:44.086 --> 00:30:46.707]  Suddenly endorsing putting Japanese in camps.
[00:30:47.108 --> 00:30:48.688]  This is official.
[00:30:49.629 --> 00:30:51.950]  They're not saying this for no reason.
[00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:54.331]  They're going to run this play.
[00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.492]  We have their handbook.
[00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:05.182]  And when they start this, it is going to cause massive retaliation.
[00:31:05.882 --> 00:31:11.925]  The police forces that try to carry this out at first will grab people with license plate reading cameras off the street.
[00:31:12.965 --> 00:31:14.666]  Conservatives, patriots will be arrested.
[00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:17.107]  They'll be picked up off the street for no reason.
[00:31:18.148 --> 00:31:24.151]  Marco Rubio's endorsed a bill that if you are even investigated as a domestic terrorist, your guns are taken.
[00:31:25.703 --> 00:31:26.664]  At first it'll work.
[00:31:26.704 --> 00:31:27.725]  They'll grab a bunch of people.
[00:31:27.865 --> 00:31:32.669]  That's meant to then elicit a response that's going to wipe out the local police and the FBI.
[00:31:33.749 --> 00:31:35.491]  Then they bring in the foreign troops.
[00:31:35.971 --> 00:31:37.032]  And they've even proposed it.
[00:31:37.432 --> 00:31:44.318]  So, all I can tell you is at this point, you can kiss America goodbye, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:48.015]  Unless there is a total awakening to this treachery.
[00:31:48.395 --> 00:31:51.379]  And in case you don't realize it, they're making their big move.
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.282]  All the other moves were probes.
[00:31:53.702 --> 00:31:55.124]  All the other moves were tests.
[00:31:55.565 --> 00:31:58.108]  All the other moves were just beta.
[00:31:58.389 --> 00:32:00.491]  This is the main assault.
[00:32:01.112 --> 00:32:02.413]  They're going to blow up federal buildings.
[00:32:02.433 --> 00:32:05.215]  They're going to shoot up colleges, churches, schools, malls.
[00:32:05.555 --> 00:32:08.878]  They're going to dump chemical weapons in lakes, in reservoirs.
[00:32:09.378 --> 00:32:16.923]  There's just going to be terror attack on terror attack as the globalist Chi-Combat Combine takes America down and causes a civil war.
[00:32:17.203 --> 00:32:23.348]  Because remember, the left thinks they're marching out to expunge the conservatives and the nationalists who they believe are Nazis.
[00:32:23.888 --> 00:32:27.611]  That's their augmented reality, like Pokemon Go.
[00:32:28.092 --> 00:32:30.854]  They believe that they're actually battling real Red Skull.
[00:32:31.074 --> 00:32:31.955]  They're Captain America.
[00:32:33.276 --> 00:32:35.098]  They're not going to have a communist purge.
[00:32:35.118 --> 00:32:35.919]  That's going to fail.
[00:32:36.639 --> 00:32:40.243]  The goal, and here's the super key, is the Civil War.
[00:32:41.817 --> 00:32:45.179]  So that's why all the feds and ADL and some of the private law centers are so pissed.
[00:32:45.219 --> 00:32:47.261]  I'm saying, be peaceful, don't be offensive.
[00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:50.823]  You know, when the cops come to take your guns, try to not be there.
[00:32:50.863 --> 00:32:51.443]  Don't shoot them.
[00:32:52.044 --> 00:32:55.546]  Because this is all meant to trigger the civil war.
[00:32:55.626 --> 00:32:56.387]  That's the goal.
[00:32:56.827 --> 00:32:59.849]  So the false flag triggers the war on American patriots.
[00:33:00.109 --> 00:33:05.012]  That triggers the civil war and the breakup of the country and the end of the dollar, which they plan to have done in a year.
[00:33:05.413 --> 00:33:08.955]  And Biden's the symbol of the dying old America who will carry it out.
[00:33:08.995 --> 00:33:11.377]  He will then step down once America collapses.
[00:33:11.917 --> 00:33:14.840]  We're about one year out from the end of the country completely, and death camps.
[00:33:15.801 --> 00:33:19.504]  Alright, again, people have been listening to this show for decades, many of you.
[00:33:19.544 --> 00:33:24.810]  Many of you just tuned in the last few years, but you're tuning in because you know, wow, Jones didn't say all this to be shocking.
[00:33:25.410 --> 00:33:27.933]  He really says what they're planning, and it comes true.
[00:33:29.209 --> 00:33:31.311]  So I just told you they're planting massive false flags.
[00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:34.594]  The left believes that leads them to some communist Valhalla.
[00:33:34.894 --> 00:33:36.455]  They're actually being set up by globalists.
[00:33:36.776 --> 00:33:41.580]  And the civil war is going to destabilize the country, break it up, and put it under multinational control.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.404]  It'll then be reorganized into a super-fascist weapons system and will take over the planet.
[00:33:47.585 --> 00:33:48.846]  Once it's merged with the European Union.
[00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:55.152]  But first they want the guns and to break our will and get us all tracked and traced and given into the system.
[00:33:56.317 --> 00:34:03.742]  So reaching out to the left that's been weaponized and taught they're the ruling class and they're in power and they suddenly love death camps in China.
[00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:05.423]  They suddenly love tyranny.
[00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:09.706]  I mean, liberals just five years ago didn't like China having death camps.
[00:34:09.726 --> 00:34:11.106]  Now they're like, oh, we love Xi Jinping.
[00:34:11.767 --> 00:34:12.908]  We want to have that here in America.
[00:34:13.808 --> 00:34:15.249]  You're being set up as well.
[00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:17.611]  All of us are going to lose our standard of living.
[00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:22.834]  All of us are going to go into something far worse than what you claim is our corrupt crony capitalist system.
[00:34:24.445 --> 00:34:30.407]  Because those very crony capitalists are bringing us into something that is the final revolution.
[00:34:31.847 --> 00:34:32.568]  That's their words.
[00:34:32.628 --> 00:34:43.852]  Where things are so authoritarian, so controlled, you're so tracked and traced that there's never any way to do anything outside of the confines other than commit suicide.
[00:34:45.312 --> 00:34:46.072]  And that's their plan.
[00:34:48.133 --> 00:34:50.394]  Make things so miserable that you kill yourself.
[00:34:51.374 --> 00:34:53.755]  So realize, don't take your normalcy bias
[00:34:55.314 --> 00:35:10.238]  If you study people getting out of Russia under the Bolsheviks, or people getting out of China under Mao, or folks getting out of Cuba under Fidel, or people getting out of Venezuela under Hugo Chavez, or folks getting out of Nazi Germany under Hitler, Hitler got into power in 1933.
[00:35:10.538 --> 00:35:15.359]  He wasn't sending people to death camps until 1942.
[00:35:17.799 --> 00:35:18.940]  He was sending people to prison.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.541]  First, he took their jobs, wouldn't let them have businesses, put them in ghettos.
[00:35:24.758 --> 00:35:27.160]  But that's how this works.
[00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:30.442]  And what do we know about the abused?
[00:35:30.682 --> 00:35:32.684]  The abused usually become abusers.
[00:35:33.144 --> 00:35:35.146]  Kids that are in pedophilia become pedophiles.
[00:35:35.786 --> 00:35:38.108]  People that are killed in death camps put you in death camps.
[00:35:39.028 --> 00:35:42.831]  And so, and even though you didn't put them in death camps, you're going to a death camp.
[00:35:43.251 --> 00:35:43.572]  Okay?
[00:35:43.772 --> 00:35:44.612]  You're going to a death camp.
[00:35:45.093 --> 00:35:47.594]  You're like, but I don't, my grandparents fought Hitler.
[00:35:47.795 --> 00:35:48.895]  Sorry, you're going to a death camp.
[00:35:51.417 --> 00:35:53.319]  And so, it's like, okay.
[00:35:54.372 --> 00:35:57.614]  So the abuse take on the identity of those that abuse them.
[00:35:58.135 --> 00:36:01.097]  That's Stockholm Syndrome, but a more sophisticated form of it.
[00:36:01.817 --> 00:36:03.058]  So these are the big secrets here.
[00:36:04.038 --> 00:36:07.901]  And so America is to be fed headfirst into oblivion.
[00:36:11.203 --> 00:36:19.629]  And it's all part of an old stupid fight going on since the days of Rome and folks that inferiority complex is back in Rome against the Roman Empire.
[00:36:22.588 --> 00:36:27.393]  And we're not even involved in that, we're not part of that, but it's all just an insane psychosis.
[00:36:28.694 --> 00:36:38.283]  And again, a projection of the shadow onto everybody else.
[00:36:40.985 --> 00:36:42.447]  Oh, I project my shadow on people.
[00:36:43.689 --> 00:36:59.098]  I think people are powerful and amazing and have incredible ideas and have incredible sexual prowess and amazing dynamics and are just meant to build civilizations and love freedom and justice.
[00:37:00.158 --> 00:37:04.341]  But I've learned not to project what I believe and who I am onto others.
[00:37:05.141 --> 00:37:06.082]  I can only hope now.
[00:37:07.762 --> 00:37:08.383]  I love myself.
[00:37:09.839 --> 00:37:12.600]  Oh, but the globalist psychologists say that's narcissistic.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:24.322]  To love the image of God imprinted on all of us and that potential blueprint for destiny and to love your fellow humans and to believe in a greater movement.
[00:37:24.862 --> 00:37:25.542]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:37:25.742 --> 00:37:29.663]  Because the globalists want you to give up your will under them.
[00:37:33.083 --> 00:37:33.703]  End of the line.
[00:37:36.124 --> 00:37:36.284]  So,
[00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:42.134]  Let's go ahead now, boys and girls, and let's just show the latest clip today.
[00:37:42.894 --> 00:37:47.336]  Coming up at 1.30, we've got a compilation that's the compilation of compilations with more.
[00:37:48.417 --> 00:37:49.398]  It's beyond a compilation.
[00:37:49.438 --> 00:37:50.998]  It's a tour de force.
[00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:53.060]  I think Gregory's his greatest work.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.041]  I worked with him in the last two days on it at 1.30 today.
[00:37:57.382 --> 00:37:58.903]  But here's just the latest Scarborough.
[00:38:00.014 --> 00:38:05.497]  Whose young, sexy intern was caught with her brains bashed out, but he was a good neocon.
[00:38:05.537 --> 00:38:06.418]  It was taken care of.
[00:38:06.838 --> 00:38:08.459]  It's creepy psycho joke.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.541]  He wants everybody that went to the Capitol.
[00:38:11.921 --> 00:38:12.722]  Cops stood down.
[00:38:12.802 --> 00:38:13.643]  Cops let everybody in.
[00:38:14.645 --> 00:38:16.726]  Most people didn't even engage in any violence.
[00:38:17.046 --> 00:38:19.027]  He wants them all to serve 20 years in prison.
[00:38:19.247 --> 00:38:26.811]  And he says that right-wing terrorists, in the full reports on Infowars.com, are just about to attack.
[00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:27.811]  He says it's imminent.
[00:38:28.271 --> 00:38:31.013]  Imminent terror attack from the Trump supporters.
[00:38:31.837 --> 00:38:34.278]  Who he knows the globalists are preparing to set up.
[00:38:34.698 --> 00:38:34.998]  Here it is.
[00:38:35.018 --> 00:38:41.041]  These people obviously felt, for whatever reason, like they were beyond reproach.
[00:38:41.822 --> 00:38:56.948]  That they could be terrorists, they could go in and commit sedition against the United States by stopping a constitutional action by the United States Congress, and they wouldn't be brought to justice.
[00:38:57.009 --> 00:38:59.930]  I think that's all the more reason why it is critical
[00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.412]  That the FBI does launch the largest manhunt in U.S.
[00:39:03.432 --> 00:39:15.040]  history, drag all these people into prison, recommend that they stay there, and if they're inside the Capitol for a full 20 years for committing sedition against the United States of America.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.401]  And this is the talking point everywhere.
[00:39:17.441 --> 00:39:18.682]  So there's Psycho Joe.
[00:39:19.422 --> 00:39:24.226]  Here's a tapper on CNN, the only the beginning, he says, of the mega-terrorism.
[00:39:24.246 --> 00:39:24.546]  Here it is.
[00:39:25.538 --> 00:39:33.943]  There is no accountability and no attempt by the Republican Party to stop these insane lies that have taken root in their party.
[00:39:34.103 --> 00:39:42.407]  Witness the support this week by the House Republicans for bigot and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Congresswoman from Georgia.
[00:39:43.388 --> 00:39:48.271]  If there's no effort at accountability, this is not going to be the end of MAGA terrorism.
[00:39:49.062 --> 00:39:51.289]  This will only be the beginning.
[00:39:52.111 --> 00:39:54.819]  Oh, the beginning, which they're going to make sure happens.
[00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.684]  But again, the globalists, the left...
[00:39:58.832 --> 00:40:05.177]  They believe, the same groups that Hitler targeted in World War II, they believe they're still fighting that Nazi menace.
[00:40:05.197 --> 00:40:13.224]  They don't get there's a group above that, British intelligence, but even more sophisticated than British intelligence, that is third, fourth, fifth dimensional analysis.
[00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:22.951]  You talk about real 3D chess, that's not Trump, that's the globalists, that is about to collide these two groups together to destroy the Republic and bring in permanent martial law.
[00:40:23.712 --> 00:40:27.773]  So the left's fantasizing about how they're about to take over and have all their dreams.
[00:40:27.813 --> 00:40:30.614]  They are about to destroy themselves and everybody else with them.
[00:40:31.434 --> 00:40:36.676]  So Maxine Waters denies ever using violent rhetoric towards Trump administration officials.
[00:40:37.856 --> 00:40:40.197]  That's a bear denying it crapped in the woods.
[00:40:40.777 --> 00:40:45.398]  Here's just a short compilation of some of them calling for violence against Republicans and others.
[00:40:55.037 --> 00:41:02.703]  A so-called anti-fascist website is encouraging, quote, all manner of physical violence against Trump supporters and capitalists.
[00:41:02.743 --> 00:41:06.045]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[00:41:07.926 --> 00:41:14.289]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[00:41:14.409 --> 00:41:15.690]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.251]  I'll join a million other people surrounding the United States Capitol.
[00:41:19.392 --> 00:41:24.034]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:27.893]  This is a national emergency.
[00:41:27.973 --> 00:41:32.896]  Joe Biden says he is concerned President Trump will try to steal the November election.
[00:41:32.936 --> 00:41:34.977]  This president is going to try to steal this election.
[00:41:35.017 --> 00:41:45.504]  This is a trial run for the President of the United States, who may be organizing to not accept what happens when we have the election.
[00:41:45.664 --> 00:41:53.008]  If he loses, and I expect that he will, then we have to be prepared for what he is going to do in the immediate aftermath of such a loss.
[00:41:53.068 --> 00:41:55.790]  Whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:01.154]  Here you have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[00:42:01.974 --> 00:42:09.119]  And you have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military state.
[00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.400]  This is not who we are.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:15.303]  If he's not elected, is he going to pull out his military?
[00:42:15.543 --> 00:42:17.144]  Is he going to engage us?
[00:42:17.285 --> 00:42:19.026]  It's already alluded to.
[00:42:19.246 --> 00:42:20.687]  There may be a civil war.
[00:42:22.816 --> 00:42:26.408]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[00:42:30.492 --> 00:42:32.654]  These are not acts of peaceful protest.
[00:42:33.534 --> 00:42:36.296]  These are acts of domestic terror.
[00:42:36.777 --> 00:42:37.957]  Seriously, Mr. President?
[00:42:38.037 --> 00:42:43.341]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders.
[00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:48.185]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration.
[00:42:48.245 --> 00:42:52.748]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:42:52.868 --> 00:42:58.272]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[00:42:58.352 --> 00:42:59.453]  Government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.271]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[00:43:05.291 --> 00:43:07.811]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:43:07.852 --> 00:43:11.913]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[00:43:12.673 --> 00:43:16.714]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's gonna do what I do.
[00:43:18.235 --> 00:43:23.437]  And now it's so fashionable to turn your back on President Trump, who won in a landslide.
[00:43:23.457 --> 00:43:24.217]  Well, I'm not doing it.
[00:43:25.237 --> 00:43:27.358]  Alright, I'm here to tell you the truth.
[00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:28.939]  Not to mince words.
[00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:32.920]  And I'm sorry that this is so painful.
[00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:38.330]  I even bought into some of the hopium with Trump.
[00:43:39.191 --> 00:43:40.852]  I knew really how serious things were.
[00:43:40.872 --> 00:43:46.275]  And I saw the confidence of Nancy Pelosi and others saying he will be gone, doesn't matter what he does.
[00:43:47.515 --> 00:43:48.676]  And I understood what that meant.
[00:43:51.097 --> 00:43:51.877]  And I tried to stop it.
[00:43:53.338 --> 00:43:56.300]  But now I need to explain to you that we have gone over the edge of the cliff.
[00:43:57.321 --> 00:43:59.863]  And things are just going to get a lot more intense after this.
[00:44:00.904 --> 00:44:05.368]  Let's get our best call screener in there if we can, if he's here yet.
[00:44:05.388 --> 00:44:08.471]  I know he helps produce the nighttime show with Owen Schroeder.
[00:44:08.491 --> 00:44:10.673]  I make sarcastic when I say call screener.
[00:44:11.794 --> 00:44:14.316]  I've always prided myself on that we don't have a call screener.
[00:44:14.376 --> 00:44:20.581]  Real call screeners in talk radio literally just get the type of calls they want and steer the discussion the way they want to go.
[00:44:21.102 --> 00:44:23.164]  Not on topic, but on people they agree with.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.001]  The view they want.
[00:44:26.422 --> 00:44:26.943]  I don't do that.
[00:44:27.384 --> 00:44:29.026]  I love callers that disagree.
[00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:35.258]  All I want is a good clear phone line and to dispense with the pleasantries and just get right to your point.
[00:44:37.233 --> 00:44:42.138]  So ahead of Jay Dyer being in studio with us, I do want to take some phone calls.
[00:44:42.519 --> 00:44:47.103]  I just hate, we got like a phone system that can take a thousand phone calls a second, can get into the line.
[00:44:47.424 --> 00:44:49.346]  One time we had like 25,000 calls in an hour.
[00:44:49.706 --> 00:44:50.747]  That's how many calls we get.
[00:44:50.827 --> 00:44:51.909]  It's a good problem to have.
[00:44:52.729 --> 00:44:59.717]  But let's put, let's put, let's put seven phone calls on the board.
[00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:06.048]  Specifically on what they think of what I've said about false flags coming.
[00:45:06.768 --> 00:45:08.890]  The left everywhere saying they're going to arrest us en masse.
[00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.871]  They want this war with us.
[00:45:09.891 --> 00:45:11.572]  Do you agree it's meant to cause a civil war?
[00:45:11.592 --> 00:45:13.534]  It's a globalist operation to take the U.S.
[00:45:13.574 --> 00:45:14.274]  out of the equation.
[00:45:14.554 --> 00:45:16.936]  So there's no example of a free country when they bring in world government.
[00:45:17.197 --> 00:45:19.258]  I mean, I want to get your take on that.
[00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:21.020]  I want to hear from you.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:21.080]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.501]  877-789-Alex.
[00:45:22.521 --> 00:45:22.561]  877-789-2539.
[00:45:33.104 --> 00:45:37.625]  And let's do first-time callers for folks that have not been able to get on the show.
[00:45:38.145 --> 00:45:40.806]  First-time callers, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:45:41.526 --> 00:45:44.826]  Or if you're on an internet or international phone that doesn't do 1-800s, 512-646-1776.
[00:45:44.846 --> 00:45:44.886]  512-646-1776.
[00:45:44.906 --> 00:45:46.247]  I want to take your calls.
[00:45:46.267 --> 00:45:47.907]  And listen, I don't like coming to somebody and saying,
[00:45:58.848 --> 00:45:59.888]  You need to go home.
[00:46:00.488 --> 00:46:01.369]  We just got a call.
[00:46:01.869 --> 00:46:02.889]  You're not answering your phone.
[00:46:03.409 --> 00:46:05.709]  Your dad just got killed in a car wreck.
[00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:19.532]  Or I don't like getting a call and going to tell the family member, hey, grandma's dead.
[00:46:24.353 --> 00:46:27.514]  But it's our job to do this.
[00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:35.152]  And if we're not honest... Yeah, I hadn't seen my grandmother in probably six months, my dad's mom.
[00:46:36.933 --> 00:46:38.053]  Gosh, I guess she's been gone.
[00:46:38.073 --> 00:46:40.394]  My son was two years old, he's 18 now.
[00:46:41.394 --> 00:46:42.434]  So I guess she's been gone.
[00:46:42.454 --> 00:46:47.336]  He's about a year and a half old, I guess 17 plus years.
[00:46:51.337 --> 00:46:56.599]  And I called my dad that afternoon before she died the next day and I said, we gotta go see Meemaw.
[00:46:57.608 --> 00:46:58.849]  He goes, You know, funny you said that.
[00:46:58.889 --> 00:46:59.830]  I thought we didn't go see her.
[00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:03.453]  And then I was on coast to coast am.
[00:47:05.415 --> 00:47:07.897]  So like four in the morning and my dad got there like seven.
[00:47:07.917 --> 00:47:08.618]  He said, Let's go.
[00:47:09.639 --> 00:47:12.421]  I was laying there in the bed came to my house back.
[00:47:12.441 --> 00:47:13.042]  Then I was younger.
[00:47:13.082 --> 00:47:14.203]  I couldn't get out of bed when I was tired.
[00:47:14.223 --> 00:47:17.286]  Now I have no problem doing it for myself to get up instantly.
[00:47:18.046 --> 00:47:18.707]  I said, No, no, no.
[00:47:18.727 --> 00:47:20.008]  And I went and finally got up.
[00:47:21.449 --> 00:47:22.871]  And I had a beer for breakfast.
[00:47:24.343 --> 00:47:28.424]  And I had one more for dessert, because I was really tired and only had like two hours sleep.
[00:47:30.485 --> 00:47:30.985]  I'm just joking.
[00:47:32.346 --> 00:47:40.088]  Then I got in the car and I'm driving to East Texas, and 30 minutes before I get there, he calls and says, I just got there when she died, and you missed it.
[00:47:41.128 --> 00:47:46.810]  See, so, there's that invisible internet that the enemy knows about.
[00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:47.771]  Spiritual.
[00:47:48.631 --> 00:47:50.491]  And they are so pissed, they want to control it, they don't.
[00:47:50.651 --> 00:47:51.872]  They'll never dominate us.
[00:47:52.756 --> 00:47:53.296]  Because it's real.
[00:47:53.717 --> 00:47:55.418]  All that ether's out there.
[00:47:56.258 --> 00:47:57.559]  And you know, my grandmother's alive.
[00:47:57.599 --> 00:47:58.380]  Her soul's real.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.581]  And I'll be with her one day.
[00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:03.343]  And it'll be so spectacular, we can't even imagine what it's like next level.
[00:48:03.623 --> 00:48:04.904]  Talk about 5G, 6G, 10G.
[00:48:04.944 --> 00:48:06.485]  How about trillion G?
[00:48:06.946 --> 00:48:08.026]  That's what God operates on.
[00:48:08.487 --> 00:48:11.189]  Unlimited infinity G. We'll be right back.
[00:48:11.209 --> 00:48:11.569]  Stay with us.
[00:48:15.812 --> 00:48:18.754]  In this journey, there's no final destination.
[00:48:19.975 --> 00:48:21.896]  There's only the next one.
[00:48:23.638 --> 00:48:28.199]  In the pursuit of perfection, the only thing that counts is the journey itself.
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.841]  The pursuit itself and those who give their lives to it.
[00:48:33.921 --> 00:48:36.962]  This moment and the focus required to seize it.
[00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:42.203]  This fight and the commitment required to face it.
[00:48:42.223 --> 00:48:45.044]  Because there's no such thing as perfect.
[00:48:45.744 --> 00:48:48.265]  There's only the relentless pursuit of perfection.
[00:48:49.585 --> 00:48:51.366]  That is our cause.
[00:48:53.004 --> 00:48:54.826]  That is what makes us a team.
[00:48:56.167 --> 00:48:58.189]  And that is why we're still here.
[00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:06.937]  So, once we're into the fray, to live and die on this day.
[00:49:13.543 --> 00:49:18.087]  So, Tom Brady won his seventh Super Bowl and they're just calling him
[00:49:20.529 --> 00:49:23.570]  A cross between Hercules and Apollo.
[00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:25.151]  He's being worshipped!
[00:49:28.192 --> 00:49:30.313]  But again, it's only a game at the end of the day.
[00:49:30.413 --> 00:49:34.695]  But we understand that human competition and human striving is what makes us great.
[00:49:34.995 --> 00:49:36.355]  So in a way, it's very wholesome.
[00:49:37.396 --> 00:49:38.636]  Men competing against each other.
[00:49:38.716 --> 00:49:39.756]  Women competing against each other.
[00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:42.778]  But onto this, they add all the globalism.
[00:49:42.818 --> 00:49:44.138]  They add the propaganda.
[00:49:44.178 --> 00:49:45.479]  They add the anti-family.
[00:49:45.799 --> 00:49:48.440]  The racial separation messages.
[00:49:50.196 --> 00:49:52.118]  So they know you hunger for this competition.
[00:49:53.999 --> 00:49:56.181]  And then they show the so-called black quarterback.
[00:49:59.264 --> 00:50:00.965]  For the Kansas team.
[00:50:02.346 --> 00:50:03.287]  The Kansas City team.
[00:50:04.608 --> 00:50:05.849]  Who's about as white as I am.
[00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.452]  And the media says it's racist that Tom Brady won!
[00:50:12.135 --> 00:50:13.916]  So that means Ronald McDonald's black, too.
[00:50:13.956 --> 00:50:14.717]  He's got curly hair.
[00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:25.234]  All of it is the attempt to project onto anything and everything going on racial division.
[00:50:26.215 --> 00:50:26.715]  Remember?
[00:50:28.056 --> 00:50:30.617]  AOC said don't grow cauliflower.
[00:50:30.677 --> 00:50:39.481]  She saw cauliflower growing at a New York community garden.
[00:50:39.901 --> 00:50:41.122]  And she said, it's white!
[00:50:43.868 --> 00:50:45.791]  Cauliflower's from Africa, you dumb monster.
[00:50:46.111 --> 00:50:47.913]  What does it matter what color it is?
[00:50:47.953 --> 00:50:51.498]  Whether it's purple or black or brown or green or red.
[00:50:51.858 --> 00:50:53.100]  If it tastes good, it's nutritious.
[00:50:53.481 --> 00:50:57.886]  But that's... total mental illness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:58.919 --> 00:51:00.200]  But she's not mentally ill.
[00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:02.082]  I mean, she's projecting it onto you.
[00:51:02.122 --> 00:51:09.210]  So, I saw a Paul Joseph Watson article this morning at Infowars.com saying, Tom Brady winning Super Bowl is racist.
[00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.870]  This is a joke.
[00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:12.713]  So I read about 20 tweets by black people saying it.
[00:51:12.753 --> 00:51:13.334]  I didn't believe it.
[00:51:13.434 --> 00:51:14.355]  I went to their accounts.
[00:51:14.635 --> 00:51:16.938]  They were serious and I read hundreds more!
[00:51:18.615 --> 00:51:21.458]  They said it's so insulting he beat a black man.
[00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:25.241]  There was a lot of black men helped Tom Brady win that Super Bowl.
[00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:27.823]  And I'm telling you, they were black, folks.
[00:51:29.885 --> 00:51:34.830]  The quarterback, I guess it's a gimmick, kind of like, who's the leader, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter?
[00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:35.550]  He's totally white.
[00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:39.794]  And you got that other white lady said she was black and she said have one drop African in her.
[00:51:40.254 --> 00:51:42.757]  I mean, folks, this is insane.
[00:51:45.265 --> 00:51:49.366]  Because, you know, Brady had at least like a half-white team with the New England Patriots.
[00:51:49.407 --> 00:51:51.007]  He says, oh God, it's white people winning.
[00:51:51.347 --> 00:51:53.788]  But his Buccaneers team's almost all black.
[00:51:54.108 --> 00:51:56.509]  What the hell does it even matter what color he is?
[00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:01.071]  But this is the mental illness.
[00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:04.632]  I thought the tweets had to be a joke.
[00:52:04.912 --> 00:52:09.774]  But it's all about the fact that he wasn't ashamed of President Trump, who was a fan before he was president.
[00:52:13.001 --> 00:52:19.591]  Oh, and they said it wasn't really, he wasn't a good quarterback, it was the system, it was the New England Patriots, it was Belichick, all that.
[00:52:20.112 --> 00:52:25.701]  So it's this idea that, A, men are bad, but, oh, white men are really bad.
[00:52:27.042 --> 00:52:29.523]  And so I'll be honest with you, I haven't watched the Super Bowl in probably five years.
[00:52:30.043 --> 00:52:31.883]  This is a distraction from a serious war.
[00:52:31.903 --> 00:52:36.024]  But I got off the air last night, went home, ate dinner with the family, had it on the background.
[00:52:36.404 --> 00:52:41.825]  And then once they slaughtered him, I didn't even watch the end of it because it was just such a collapse by the other team.
[00:52:42.105 --> 00:52:44.646]  And they're like, look, the black quarterback's losing.
[00:52:45.026 --> 00:52:49.407]  Dude, that other quarterback had whiter skin than I do.
[00:52:52.388 --> 00:52:54.288]  I mean, I guess I'll curl my hair and say I'm black.
[00:52:56.277 --> 00:52:57.058]  It doesn't even matter.
[00:52:57.118 --> 00:52:59.199]  It's like, what the hell does that have to do with anything?
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.881]  What color a quarterback is?
[00:53:01.461 --> 00:53:02.342]  It's how good they play.
[00:53:02.622 --> 00:53:09.068]  You know, if Tom Brady was a black guy, he would be just as famous, or probably more so, and I would still think he was an amazing quarterback.
[00:53:10.229 --> 00:53:14.432]  See, I feel good about myself because of my own personal successes.
[00:53:14.753 --> 00:53:16.934]  Not because, like, oh, my skin's pink.
[00:53:18.316 --> 00:53:19.777]  But that's mental illness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:21.445 --> 00:53:22.606]  Talk about colors I like.
[00:53:22.946 --> 00:53:24.247]  There's nobody that's the color I like.
[00:53:24.327 --> 00:53:25.068]  I like green.
[00:53:25.488 --> 00:53:26.149]  My dad knows that.
[00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:27.089]  He gave me a green watch.
[00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:28.570]  Maybe I'm a Martian.
[00:53:29.992 --> 00:53:32.253]  I mean, I got a purple shirt on, folks.
[00:53:32.433 --> 00:53:33.474]  I like purple people.
[00:53:33.494 --> 00:53:34.275]  I like eggplant.
[00:53:34.655 --> 00:53:36.296]  This is mental illness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:36.457 --> 00:53:37.577]  I got a black microphone.
[00:53:37.597 --> 00:53:38.178]  What does that mean?
[00:53:38.518 --> 00:53:39.279]  I like how it looks.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.441]  Back in the day, nobody had black microphones.
[00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:45.564]  Everybody copies me.
[00:53:45.584 --> 00:53:49.667]  70% are black in the NFL, but it's not enough.
[00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:50.868]  You gotta make it racial.
[00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:52.989]  Hey, let's make it politically correct.
[00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:55.750]  Let's not make it about who's the best.
[00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:56.751]  Let's make it about color.
[00:53:57.331 --> 00:54:00.572]  Okay, well, of the countries, this person is 13% black.
[00:54:00.852 --> 00:54:04.073]  Only 13% of the NFL can be black, not 70 plus percent.
[00:54:04.793 --> 00:54:08.695]  But I know you all know that, but it's the way they project.
[00:54:08.715 --> 00:54:09.715]  Yeah, what's that idiot's name?
[00:54:10.955 --> 00:54:11.756]  Sean King.
[00:54:12.196 --> 00:54:13.556]  No African blood.
[00:54:13.576 --> 00:54:15.297]  I mean, just look at him.
[00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:19.362]  But he takes on the identity of black people so he can raise hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:54:19.742 --> 00:54:20.662]  And then who's the other lady?
[00:54:21.122 --> 00:54:25.384]  The blonde haired lady that like, frizzes her hair out and puts, puts, what's her name?
[00:54:26.524 --> 00:54:27.644]  Rachel Dulzar.
[00:54:28.885 --> 00:54:29.085]  Yeah.
[00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:30.805]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[00:54:31.666 --> 00:54:33.506]  It's absolutely sick.
[00:54:33.886 --> 00:54:34.687]  And it's mentally ill.
[00:54:35.807 --> 00:54:38.068]  But I'm digressing, I'm almost out of time in this segment.
[00:54:39.368 --> 00:54:42.109]  I wanted to illustrate, let's just keep rolling it, Tom Brady!
[00:54:43.194 --> 00:54:54.180]  Knows that it's not as bad as the flu or pneumonia, knows that it's a hoax, refuses to wear his mask at the beginning, after the game, and they're so mad at him he did that on purpose.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:00.803]  That makes me like Tom Brady way more than the fact that he is the greatest of all time, no doubt in the NFL.
[00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:10.836]  He's now the greatest of all time, not being a coward like the other white dude posing as a black dude on the other team that got his ass ran over.
[00:55:11.516 --> 00:55:14.999]  Maybe if you'd had a black quarterback, you would have not lost.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.383]  They got some real black quarterbacks and another quarterback's great.
[00:55:20.803 --> 00:55:24.986]  But my point is, I mean, he was like throwing passes when he's being tackled that people are catching.
[00:55:25.446 --> 00:55:28.989]  Yeah, I mean, look at this, ladies and gentlemen, there's Rachel Dozell or whatever the hell her name is.
[00:55:30.523 --> 00:55:33.968]  But this is all the Global is trying to get us to end the fight with each other.
[00:55:33.988 --> 00:55:36.811]  Yeah, there's the black quarterback.
[00:55:37.232 --> 00:55:39.315]  And I mean, you know he's, look at that, look at that hair.
[00:55:39.615 --> 00:55:41.397]  He's getting that curled, folks.
[00:55:42.519 --> 00:55:45.303]  He's in there hours a week getting it all like that.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.521]  So he can say he's black.
[00:55:48.002 --> 00:55:51.625]  What was his great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great granddaddy black?
[00:55:52.326 --> 00:55:57.090]  And that goes to some of the southern racism where if you had one drop of African blood, you weren't white.
[00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:57.751]  Who the hell?
[00:55:57.791 --> 00:55:58.671]  He's a human being.
[00:55:58.992 --> 00:55:59.852]  He's not a bad guy.
[00:56:00.433 --> 00:56:08.040]  But it's total mental illness to say Tom Brady's racist because it's Black History Month.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:08.981]  That was the other big thing.
[00:56:09.361 --> 00:56:09.982]  I can't believe it.
[00:56:10.362 --> 00:56:11.043]  But we come back.
[00:56:13.945 --> 00:56:21.088]  When we come back, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to lay out the reality of Joe Biden shows up at the game via Jumbotron.
[00:56:21.568 --> 00:56:22.288]  He's booed!
[00:56:25.129 --> 00:56:31.612]  And then you've got this Bruce Springsteen ad, who was anti-Trump, anti-American, now about unity and we need to come together.
[00:56:31.652 --> 00:56:34.853]  They want you to hold onto a flag while they bury America.
[00:56:35.753 --> 00:56:38.554]  We're going to cover this PSYOP when we come back.
[00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:42.296]  By the way, it was sold out for three months, activated charcoal.
[00:56:43.976 --> 00:56:46.860]  Naturally fluoride free, no additives, no preservatives.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.386]  Incredible concentrated activated charcoal from Dr. Jones Naturals, my dad, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:52.807 --> 00:56:55.751]  And it's great concentrated toothpaste and it funds operation.
[00:56:55.791 --> 00:56:56.732]  I'm really, really proud of it.
[00:56:56.932 --> 00:56:58.975]  And sold out!
[00:57:00.441 --> 00:57:05.526]  But now back in stock, the highest quality vitamin D three with vitamin K for your immune system back in stock.
[00:57:05.566 --> 00:57:10.551]  It's an essential nutrient, and it funds the M4, which makes it a win win back in stock.

[00:57:33.423 --> 00:57:34.243]  The globalists hate it.
[00:57:34.523 --> 00:57:35.464]  We support the operation.
[00:57:35.764 --> 00:57:38.264]  We'll be back with the rest of the Super Bowl and then your phone calls.
[00:57:40.185 --> 00:57:41.025]  Oh, you're a liberal.
[00:57:43.005 --> 00:57:45.005]  I do know the ice caps will be melted by 2017.
[00:57:45.666 --> 00:57:46.066]  Al Gore said.
[00:57:48.848 --> 00:57:53.929]  But he and Hillary and Barack Obama, they all bought houses right on the beach.
[00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:56.450]  And none of them got flooded.
[00:57:58.931 --> 00:58:01.731]  Okay, I'm taking phone calls right now.
[00:58:03.372 --> 00:58:05.732]  Here in just a few minutes, I want to finish up with the NFL talk.
[00:58:07.033 --> 00:58:08.393]  Because, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:58:10.214 --> 00:58:12.934]  Part of me gets mad at bread and circus and gladiatorial events.
[00:58:13.454 --> 00:58:15.595]  Because men that should be involved in their own lives
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:23.946]  Standing up themselves, spend all their time obsessing on sports because it's simulated combat instead of actually living our own lives.
[00:58:25.328 --> 00:58:26.809]  But sports are good for people.
[00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:28.851]  Sports get people to take action.
[00:58:28.871 --> 00:58:30.132]  Sports are about competition.
[00:58:30.552 --> 00:58:34.436]  There's a lot of good things, but I don't like what's attached to sports, the whole globalist agenda.
[00:58:35.297 --> 00:58:37.239]  But yesterday was so revealing.
[00:58:38.444 --> 00:58:47.152]  With Tom Brady, the greatest of all time in the NFL, not wearing his mask, being criticized, the losers wearing their mask, calling out the fraud.
[00:58:47.172 --> 00:58:56.722]  And then you had Joe Biden on the jumbo trunk, up there telling everybody, wear your mask, social distance.
[00:58:58.786 --> 00:58:59.767]  Have a moment of silence.
[00:59:00.488 --> 00:59:07.436]  And people weren't booing and yelling at the people that have died of COVID, which is probably about 20,000 people.
[00:59:07.456 --> 00:59:08.537]  Everybody else died of something else.
[00:59:08.557 --> 00:59:09.558]  They just can't count it as that.
[00:59:10.279 --> 00:59:18.969]  They were yelling at Joe Biden, forcing himself in as this leader, telling you that you're under his control.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:32.067]  So here's a little clip from somebody's cell phone of the Jumbotron overlooking everyone with Biden all dressed up in a suit, again, forcing himself in to the event.
[00:59:32.127 --> 00:59:32.527]  Here it is.
[00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:42.814]  As we deal with all of our social workers, we all can do our part to save lives.
[00:59:42.834 --> 00:59:43.334]  Wear masks.
[00:59:44.215 --> 00:59:46.576]  Stay socially distanced.
[00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:47.977]  Get tested.
[00:59:47.997 --> 00:59:49.118]  Get vaccinated when the time comes.
[00:59:50.519 --> 00:59:52.380]  Most of all, let's remember all those who lost.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:58.084]  So please join us, KSGCBT, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and National Football Club.
[00:59:58.124 --> 01:00:11.813]  When a boatload of cyclists from more than 440,000 Americans lost their life in this pandemic, it's going to be a marvelous life for you and your family.
[01:00:11.913 --> 01:00:14.095]  I was left behind.
[01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:27.747]  And it's very interesting because once the booing started, they cut the live feed.
[01:00:27.767 --> 01:00:29.808]  We were able to find where the booing actually happened.
[01:00:30.248 --> 01:00:38.753]  So there are people rejecting this mummy who's virtually there telling them what to do with a bunch of fear that they're dirty, they're bad.
[01:00:39.113 --> 01:00:39.873]  Get tested.
[01:00:39.913 --> 01:00:40.674]  The tests are fake.
[01:00:40.714 --> 01:00:41.454]  Create higher numbers.
[01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:42.755]  Take your vaccine.
[01:00:42.815 --> 01:00:43.776]  How is he a doctor?
[01:00:44.056 --> 01:00:45.236]  How is Bill Gates a doctor?
[01:00:45.296 --> 01:00:46.037]  How are they doing this?
[01:00:48.373 --> 01:00:49.853]  So there's the real ad you need to see.
[01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.094]  It's Tom Brady.
[01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:56.295]  Like 30 million views on Twitter, 20-something million views on YouTube without even looking.
[01:00:56.335 --> 01:01:09.258]  I just saw two versions this morning, with the vast majority, the same amount of people that watched the Super Bowl, praising Tom Brady not wearing a mask, cutting through the fraud, cutting through the lies, just like that grocery store in Naples, Florida.
[01:01:11.358 --> 01:01:12.198]  And then I saw this.
[01:01:12.278 --> 01:01:14.559]  I said, is that Bruce Springsteen last night I was watching?
[01:01:15.526 --> 01:01:23.973]  Bruce Springsteen has attacked Trump, said Trump's un-American, attacked the Second Amendment, attacked our borders, attacked the existence of our country.
[01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:27.516]  He's a dirtbag, leftist, icon, globalist.
[01:01:29.554 --> 01:01:38.656]  And then he runs this GPab with all these crosses and all this iconography like Jeep is Christian and Jeep is good and oh come to the middle.
[01:01:38.936 --> 01:01:47.618]  When they move the Overton window to pedophilia and world government and globalism and America's bad, the middle now is America just sucks.
[01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.619]  The left is death to America.
[01:01:52.145 --> 01:02:02.996]  So it used to, it was like, you know, God, country, conservatism, capitalism, patriotism, and the middle was like, well, you know, I'm an international person and I don't think America's that good.
[01:02:03.377 --> 01:02:07.081]  To the left, well, let's just, you know, sell America out.
[01:02:07.501 --> 01:02:13.688]  To now they've moved it way over here to, well, America can maybe exist a little, but we're going to destroy part of it, to no, America must die.
[01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:41.887]  And so you watch this sickening ad with Bruce Springsteen dressed up like he's, you know, this big cowboy, and he's this big patriot, he's this loner out in the middle of the Midwest, and he's this good, decent person, and America's been through all this, let's come together, when what he represents, what General Motors now represents with their leftist garbage, when they did those campaign ads for Biden, they had the virtual meetings with Biden, where there weren't people there, there were GM vehicles.
[01:02:45.154 --> 01:02:46.114]  Like the Autobots.
[01:02:46.794 --> 01:02:48.575]  Autobots transform and roll out.
[01:02:49.895 --> 01:02:50.996]  I am Optimus Prime.
[01:02:51.076 --> 01:02:52.516]  I come from Cybertron.
[01:02:53.196 --> 01:03:01.899]  They are sitting there doing this, and so now he's this John Wayne character, the good man, and he's gonna bring America together in the middle, the middle of the road.
[01:03:02.659 --> 01:03:05.560]  Neither hot nor warm, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:09.082]  And oh yes, General Motors Jeep.
[01:03:09.503 --> 01:03:10.984]  I'll never buy another Jeep.
[01:03:11.024 --> 01:03:14.146]  I bought my dad a Jeep like 10 years ago as a birthday present when he was like 60.
[01:03:14.526 --> 01:03:21.912]  Yeah, I will never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, I'm ashamed I even ever bought Chevy products.
[01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:25.355]  This is the disgusting sycophantic behavior of these people.
[01:03:27.765 --> 01:03:30.787]  And it's Bruce Springsteen riding around like he's John Wayne.
[01:03:31.087 --> 01:03:32.548]  He supports taking your guns.
[01:03:32.969 --> 01:03:36.391]  He supports transgender stuff in the bathrooms of your kids.
[01:03:36.671 --> 01:03:37.452]  He hates Trump.
[01:03:37.492 --> 01:03:37.952]  Look it up!
[01:03:38.412 --> 01:03:40.694]  Oh, but now he's the good guy gonna bring you together.
[01:03:40.954 --> 01:03:41.955]  He's Bruce Springsteen.
[01:03:42.175 --> 01:03:43.436]  He's the spirit of America.
[01:03:43.636 --> 01:03:46.237]  Here is this disgustingly condescending ad.
[01:03:46.257 --> 01:03:53.963]  Got driving around in his old Jeep.
[01:03:54.023 --> 01:03:55.444]  Got cowboy boots on.
[01:03:56.465 --> 01:04:02.027]  There's a chapel in Kansas, standing on the exact center of the lower 48.
[01:04:02.567 --> 01:04:05.107]  It never closes.
[01:04:06.268 --> 01:04:12.429]  All are more than welcome to come meet here in the middle.
[01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:17.831]  It's no secret, the middle has been a hard place to get to lately.
[01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:22.552]  Between red and blue, between servant and citizen.
[01:04:22.732 --> 01:04:23.513]  What a good person.
[01:04:23.653 --> 01:04:24.673]  Between our freedom
[01:04:25.799 --> 01:04:26.559]  And our fear.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.561]  Now, fear has never been the best of who we are.
[01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.181]  Shows these empty cities.
[01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:33.182]  The race for freedom.
[01:04:33.362 --> 01:04:33.782]  That they did.
[01:04:33.922 --> 01:04:36.783]  Is not the property of just the fortunate few.
[01:04:37.203 --> 01:04:38.443]  It belongs to us all.
[01:04:38.463 --> 01:04:38.944]  Hit pause.
[01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:40.224]  Not just the fortunate few.
[01:04:40.284 --> 01:04:44.506]  It's the globalists funding the racial discrimination, the separation of Black Lives Matter.
[01:04:44.906 --> 01:04:45.626]  They all do it.
[01:04:45.646 --> 01:04:49.327]  Then, oh, we're the heroes bringing unity together after we just gang raped your ass.
[01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:51.168]  Let's continue with Bruce Springsteen.
[01:04:51.732 --> 01:04:53.233]  We're just a fortunate few.
[01:04:53.633 --> 01:04:55.534]  It belongs to us all.
[01:04:55.834 --> 01:04:56.094]  Ugh!
[01:04:56.755 --> 01:05:02.518]  Whoever you are, wherever you're from, it's what connects us.
[01:05:03.518 --> 01:05:04.919]  And we need that connection.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.501]  We need the middle.
[01:05:07.521 --> 01:05:08.481]  I mean, what a fake!
[01:05:09.101 --> 01:05:14.725]  We just have to remember the very soil we stand on is common ground.
[01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.186]  So we can get there.
[01:05:18.945 --> 01:05:22.587]  We can make it to the mountain through the desert.
[01:05:24.149 --> 01:05:26.430]  And we will cross this divide.
[01:05:28.071 --> 01:05:32.574]  Our light has always found its way through the darkness.
[01:05:34.535 --> 01:05:36.637]  And there's hope on the road up ahead.
[01:05:42.927 --> 01:05:44.267]  Oh, there's hope on the road ahead.
[01:05:44.287 --> 01:05:48.308]  You're taking all your jobs, shutting your power off, shutting your Keystone Pipeline down.
[01:05:48.328 --> 01:05:50.989]  But just trust Bruce Springsteen.
[01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.030]  Just trust him and trust Jeep.
[01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:56.631]  Defunded Joe Biden.
[01:05:57.991 --> 01:05:58.811]  Oh, the road ahead.
[01:05:59.552 --> 01:06:01.092]  Everybody ought to burn their Jeeps.
[01:06:01.672 --> 01:06:02.112]  Seriously.
[01:06:02.412 --> 01:06:03.072]  What a joke.
[01:06:03.112 --> 01:06:04.793]  What other Hollywood fraud.
[01:06:04.813 --> 01:06:07.394]  You're going to burn in hell, Springsteen!
[01:06:07.494 --> 01:06:08.214]  Burn in hell!
[01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:12.055]  So... We are just...
[01:06:13.717 --> 01:06:14.477]  Counting down here.
[01:06:17.118 --> 01:06:17.618]  Counting down.
[01:06:19.598 --> 01:06:20.099]  Oh, is this Elvis?
[01:06:20.119 --> 01:06:22.799]  Let's hear a little bit of this.
[01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:25.200]  We're counting down to the false flag.
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:30.781]  Next hour, I'm going to premiere the proof of them coming for you and me.
[01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:32.822]  At least you know they're coming.
[01:06:35.482 --> 01:06:37.123]  Little less talk, little more action.
[01:06:37.143 --> 01:06:41.964]  I guess that's what the left wants to give us.
[01:06:48.187 --> 01:06:49.027]  Emergency alert!
[01:06:49.047 --> 01:06:51.068]  Global is preparing massive false flags!
[01:06:51.348 --> 01:06:53.549]  It's a pretext for Soviet-style purge!
[01:06:53.629 --> 01:06:54.490]  Watch live!
[01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:55.630]  Woo!
[01:06:56.431 --> 01:06:57.631]  And just watch it all happen!
[01:07:00.633 --> 01:07:01.593]  We won't be on air then.
[01:07:02.934 --> 01:07:04.154]  But you'll remember it in your head.
[01:07:07.756 --> 01:07:09.037]  Let yourself go!
[01:07:09.057 --> 01:07:09.117]  Woo!
[01:07:11.758 --> 01:07:13.759]  Just throw your arms around me real tight!
[01:07:21.607 --> 01:07:25.749]  I ain't being a shotgun shag out in the middle of the woods with my lady listening to this.
[01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:29.431]  And a case of Jack Daniels.
[01:07:30.832 --> 01:07:31.552]  Ha ha ha!
[01:07:35.054 --> 01:07:35.794]  Real tight!
[01:07:35.814 --> 01:07:42.497]  Alright, I'm going to stop being bad.
[01:07:43.018 --> 01:07:44.378]  I'm not going to drink any, I'm joking.
[01:07:46.039 --> 01:07:47.760]  Oh, let ourselves go into war, too!
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.361]  That's going to be fun, a little bit of Civil War.
[01:07:50.981 --> 01:07:53.363]  It's kind of the same type of deal, isn't it?
[01:07:53.383 --> 01:07:53.443]  Woo!
[01:07:53.523 --> 01:07:55.805]  Once it's going on, nobody's scared no more!
[01:07:56.045 --> 01:07:58.127]  Except those people that are dying.
[01:07:59.528 --> 01:08:00.569]  When the killers come.
[01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.632]  When the killers come.
[01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.014]  When the dying starts.
[01:08:07.195 --> 01:08:08.756]  When the praying to mommy starts.
[01:08:10.457 --> 01:08:14.441]  Don't look like the left's much ready for a war, but they sure want one because they ain't ever been in one.
[01:08:17.108 --> 01:08:19.250]  Alright, I didn't know they were going to play that old bumper music.
[01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:20.151]  I like me some Elvis.
[01:08:20.191 --> 01:08:21.452]  I apologize for ranting here.
[01:08:21.472 --> 01:08:31.881]  We got Catherine, we got Pastor Sam, we got Harry, we got Tyler, we got Terry, we got Kevin, we got Steve, we got James, we got Chris, we got Mike and Russell!
[01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:37.486]  We got twenty-something callers and I said I want seven on that board because I don't want to keep people on hold.
[01:08:37.506 --> 01:08:39.108]  But let's just go to them now.
[01:08:40.435 --> 01:08:49.541]  While we sit here waiting for that big old juicy false flag terror attack so they can start that civil war and break this country up real nice.
[01:08:52.283 --> 01:08:59.348]  And if you think those poor two FBI agents getting killed was sad down in Florida last week, well it'll be a hundred times that, which I don't want.
[01:08:59.708 --> 01:09:00.628]  But the globalists want it.
[01:09:01.989 --> 01:09:04.091]  And your bosses are going to send you right into that.
[01:09:05.316 --> 01:09:07.762]  But don't worry, we got Patriot Singers time for war too!
[01:09:08.183 --> 01:09:10.930]  Pastor Sam, I see you strongly disagree with me!
[01:09:11.211 --> 01:09:13.276]  This is not the time to lie down!
[01:09:13.991 --> 01:09:16.193]  You know, Pastor Sam, I didn't say lie down.
[01:09:16.493 --> 01:09:22.198]  I said if the cops are coming to confiscate guns at your house, it's a good idea to not be waiting for them and kill them.
[01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:24.279]  Because they've been brainwashed.
[01:09:24.379 --> 01:09:29.023]  I get it at a certain point it's going to start up here, but that's not lying down.
[01:09:29.163 --> 01:09:32.406]  I'm saying the target isn't the police.
[01:09:32.806 --> 01:09:35.228]  So if they get the police to come for our guns,
[01:09:36.443 --> 01:09:44.271]  I'm a big boy, I'm a smart boy, then I would want to go after, which I'm not saying do, the actual people that were running the show.
[01:09:44.572 --> 01:09:46.093]  But you call that lying down.
[01:09:46.354 --> 01:09:48.156]  Tell me, Pastor Sam, how to be a man.
[01:09:48.556 --> 01:09:49.257]  Tell me how to do it.
[01:09:50.618 --> 01:09:56.423]  Well, I know you said to dispense with the niceties, but first I'm going to tell you... Tell me how to be a man, Sam!
[01:09:56.943 --> 01:10:01.307]  I'm going to tell you that I love you and that I'm a prayer partner for what you're doing.
[01:10:01.688 --> 01:10:03.669]  And I followed you for 20 years.
[01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:10.015]  I was standing right beside you when we got attacked at the Beto Rally in Austin with our guns on.
[01:10:11.196 --> 01:10:14.879]  They slammed right against our bodies before the police finally showed up.
[01:10:14.899 --> 01:10:16.560]  There was a giant horde of Beto people.
[01:10:18.254 --> 01:10:18.875]  Two years ago.
[01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:20.597]  Listen, I got a lot of callers.
[01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:21.398]  I got a lot of callers.
[01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:27.504]  I got a lot of... Make your point!
[01:10:28.926 --> 01:10:30.768]  GospelGunslingers.com.
[01:10:31.148 --> 01:10:35.473]  I'm teaching from the Bible about self-defense and about self-government.
[01:10:35.493 --> 01:10:38.897]  You said you strongly disagree with me.
[01:10:38.977 --> 01:10:39.538]  Tell me what it is.
[01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:57.261]  Okay, two years ago, Rodney Howard Brown, false prophet, called for revolt and armed rebellion, and you went along with him, and I told you you were wrong then, he did it again one year ago, I told you you were wrong then, and now he's nowhere to be seen when we really need to stand for our lives.
[01:10:57.441 --> 01:11:00.704]  I did not see Rodney Howard Brown call for a national rebellion.
[01:11:01.892 --> 01:11:03.273]  Well, he's on your show and did it.
[01:11:03.613 --> 01:11:06.274]  And I even called in and told you that you were out of line on that.
[01:11:07.374 --> 01:11:10.895]  Okay, so now I'm back because I do want a war.
[01:11:11.576 --> 01:11:13.376]  Okay, I didn't remember that, but okay.
[01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.417]  Listen, hey brother, we're on the show.
[01:11:15.477 --> 01:11:19.298]  It isn't about tit for tat and sitting there, who's good, who's bad, any of this.
[01:11:19.338 --> 01:11:22.419]  Will you just please tell me what your view is on what's currently happening?
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.401]  I'm not saying that the police should be attacked.
[01:11:26.903 --> 01:11:31.051]  What I will say is that the police are worthless right now as far as enforcing the law.
[01:11:31.071 --> 01:11:34.016]  And don't worry, they're going to lose everything they got and the whole country's going to burn.
[01:11:34.096 --> 01:11:34.637]  I get it.
[01:11:34.677 --> 01:11:35.298]  So don't worry.
[01:11:35.338 --> 01:11:38.123]  You're not going to have to sit back and hurt the cops and lose everything they got.
[01:11:38.956 --> 01:11:42.857]  The military is not doing what they need to be doing.
[01:11:43.277 --> 01:11:44.337]  They're waiting for us.
[01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:46.558]  And you say that Trump's not the president.
[01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:47.178]  I agree.
[01:11:47.518 --> 01:11:49.779]  But we can draft him to be the president.
[01:11:49.799 --> 01:11:50.519]  He's the president.
[01:11:50.759 --> 01:11:51.999]  No, he was elected.
[01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:52.980]  He is the president.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.781]  I'm just telling you, he is isolated and cut off.
[01:11:57.401 --> 01:11:58.821]  Look, I appreciate your call, Pastor Sam.
[01:11:58.901 --> 01:12:00.002]  I can't argue this all day.
[01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.611]  I did not say that we shouldn't defend ourselves.
[01:12:04.372 --> 01:12:09.395]  I said they're trying to start a civil war, and if everybody that wants one, you're going to probably get it.
[01:12:09.775 --> 01:12:11.256]  I think you probably will all get it.
[01:12:11.336 --> 01:12:12.777]  So, all?
[01:12:14.478 --> 01:12:14.838]  Okay!
[01:12:15.638 --> 01:12:20.021]  I'm just... Do you understand?
[01:12:20.761 --> 01:12:22.402]  The left will be destroyed in this.
[01:12:22.883 --> 01:12:23.963]  But they've been set up.
[01:12:24.143 --> 01:12:25.924]  It's meant to destroy the country.
[01:12:26.185 --> 01:12:26.725]  And I get it!
[01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:30.489]  I get it, maybe the country needs to be gone, okay?
[01:12:30.569 --> 01:12:32.649]  I mean, we're a demonic nation, let's not lie about that.
[01:12:33.209 --> 01:12:46.152]  I'm just saying that I'm here just exposing the globalist operation and trying to get smart people in the system, private citizens, government, corporations, you name it, to think about how dangerous things are.
[01:12:46.652 --> 01:12:50.833]  And to get outside the whole, you know, this group versus that group situation.
[01:12:50.993 --> 01:12:53.254]  Because this country is under judgment.
[01:12:55.054 --> 01:12:57.015]  Catherine in Canada, you're on the air, welcome!
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.260]  Hi there.
[01:12:59.301 --> 01:12:59.761]  Hi Alex.
[01:12:59.781 --> 01:13:00.201]  How are you?
[01:13:00.221 --> 01:13:00.862]  I'm alright.
[01:13:00.882 --> 01:13:01.222]  Go ahead.
[01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:01.783]  Welcome.
[01:13:01.883 --> 01:13:02.023]  Good.
[01:13:02.063 --> 01:13:02.323]  Okay.
[01:13:02.484 --> 01:13:04.946]  I want to make a point about the January 6th event.
[01:13:05.266 --> 01:13:12.473]  For all these people that think there was just Trump supporters, for five years there was a counter-protest at every Trump event.
[01:13:12.934 --> 01:13:17.979]  I just want to ask these people that want to blame Trump people, where was their counter-protest that day?
[01:13:18.259 --> 01:13:21.202]  That January 6th event was planned for over two months.
[01:13:21.662 --> 01:13:25.386]  Where was the police line and keep it beyond counter-protest that day?
[01:13:25.706 --> 01:13:26.607]  There wasn't any.
[01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:27.648]  I wonder where they are.
[01:13:27.668 --> 01:13:28.849]  And I just want to make that point.
[01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:30.430]  Ask themselves one question.
[01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.853]  Where was the counter-protest on January 6th?
[01:13:32.873 --> 01:13:34.714]  Well, let me answer your question, Catherine.
[01:13:34.734 --> 01:13:35.815]  I'll hold you over if need be.
[01:13:36.856 --> 01:13:39.097]  Did everybody see my Saturday show or the Sunday show?
[01:13:39.137 --> 01:13:42.919]  It's called The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign that Saved the 2020 Election.
[01:13:43.239 --> 01:13:46.280]  It's a 25-page article, Time Magazine, and I know the players.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.461]  I know that it's basically an accurate article.
[01:13:48.901 --> 01:13:56.904]  They brag how the powerful elite stole the election and how they basically stood down in the Capitol that day knowing we'd tear things up.
[01:13:56.964 --> 01:13:57.864]  We'd never torn things up.
[01:13:57.884 --> 01:14:01.766]  They had their provocateurs in there to then lead a few Q people into it.
[01:14:01.846 --> 01:14:04.047]  It's all in the article.
[01:14:05.194 --> 01:14:12.930]  At the end, they admit the whole thing, how they snuckered us, and how they did that, and how they walked us right into the trap.
[01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:13.851]  So go ahead.
[01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:16.142]  Yeah, no, I read the article.
[01:14:16.182 --> 01:14:21.006]  I've been watching conservative news all over the place, freaking out about it, thinking like it's a big deal.
[01:14:21.287 --> 01:14:23.128]  They're bragging because they got away with it.
[01:14:23.248 --> 01:14:24.690]  They know they have no accountability.
[01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:26.231]  But I'm talking about these people.
[01:14:26.251 --> 01:14:30.975]  Like, there's certain people on YouTube that are saying, like, it's a conspiracy, it was just Trump people.
[01:14:31.135 --> 01:14:34.618]  Like, I'm asking them, like, where was their protest that day?
[01:14:34.818 --> 01:14:38.802]  I don't think those people understand that these people just brag out in the open what they're doing.
[01:14:39.531 --> 01:14:47.419]  I mean, listen, I saw the footage later because I only got there like 30 minutes or actually a couple hours into the Capitol thing starting, but 30 minutes after they breached it, roughly.
[01:14:48.279 --> 01:14:54.165]  And it was like skinny jeans, guys in black, mask on, attack, attack, it's your time.
[01:14:54.585 --> 01:14:56.567]  And most of the crowd, 99%, was like, what?
[01:14:56.587 --> 01:14:57.008]  No way.
[01:14:57.448 --> 01:14:59.130]  In fact, Patriots tried to beat them up and stop them.
[01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:00.431]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:06.045]  Let's finish up, Catherine, your point briefly when we come back about civil war, the insurrection they're trying to provoke.
[01:15:06.365 --> 01:15:07.285]  How do we stop that?
[01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:09.765]  Some will say, oh, Jones, you don't want a civil war?
[01:15:11.266 --> 01:15:13.986]  You saw how that went on January 6th.
[01:15:15.306 --> 01:15:17.267]  It's going to be led by a bunch of provocateurs.
[01:15:17.587 --> 01:15:20.987]  They're going to set off truck bombs at daycare centers and blame it on us.
[01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:23.988]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:15:24.008 --> 01:15:24.748]  to 3 p.m.
[01:15:25.008 --> 01:15:27.028]  It's the Alex Jones Show with yours truly.
[01:15:27.329 --> 01:15:29.469]  Then The War Room, Owen Schroer, weekday mornings.
[01:15:30.711 --> 01:15:34.612]  Harrison Smith and American Journal, the big call-in show.
[01:15:35.432 --> 01:15:36.512]  Hey, I know Pastor Sam.
[01:15:36.552 --> 01:15:36.972]  I've met him.
[01:15:37.472 --> 01:15:40.053]  He's probably been a guest on the show three or four times, friends with Owen.
[01:15:40.753 --> 01:15:42.654]  He actually worked with them before as a camera guy.
[01:15:42.894 --> 01:15:44.294]  I know who he is.
[01:15:44.334 --> 01:15:45.094]  They have to remind me.
[01:15:45.834 --> 01:15:49.275]  I saw on the board that it said, oh, disagrees we shouldn't lay down.
[01:15:49.415 --> 01:15:50.135]  I didn't say that.
[01:15:51.175 --> 01:15:53.836]  I literally am not kissing the police or military's ass.
[01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:57.577]  I told you they'll take orders pretty much from whoever they're told on average.
[01:15:58.459 --> 01:16:00.920]  We're in trouble unless we affect the battle space and educate them.
[01:16:01.461 --> 01:16:07.764]  I just said they want to kick a civil war off that brings down the local infrastructure to collapse the economy and bring the UN in.
[01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:09.806]  The civil war is the goal.
[01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.186]  This is not a leftist takeover.
[01:16:11.747 --> 01:16:13.748]  It is a globalist civil war they're triggering.
[01:16:14.168 --> 01:16:15.129]  That's a guarantee.
[01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:18.991]  And so I'm just trying to stop this.
[01:16:20.165 --> 01:16:21.485]  This is real, okay?
[01:16:21.585 --> 01:16:22.646]  I know it's going down.
[01:16:22.726 --> 01:16:23.546]  They admit it now.
[01:16:24.086 --> 01:16:26.767]  At the bottom of the next hour, we're going to air a special report that details this.
[01:16:26.787 --> 01:16:28.288]  It's one of the most important ever.
[01:16:28.948 --> 01:16:31.389]  John Bowne has put another report out that's very important.
[01:16:31.649 --> 01:16:33.469]  They want your guns at Bandai Video.
[01:16:33.509 --> 01:16:35.470]  Just went live literally minutes ago.
[01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:42.172]  Katherine, though, specifically, you say civil war insurrection is what they're trying.
[01:16:42.232 --> 01:16:42.832]  I agree with you.
[01:16:42.872 --> 01:16:43.652]  How do we stop it?
[01:16:44.073 --> 01:16:45.053]  Or what's going to happen next?
[01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:49.679]  We're good to go.
[01:17:09.654 --> 01:17:10.454]  You know, that's a good point.
[01:17:10.494 --> 01:17:11.535]  I'm gonna go to the next person.
[01:17:11.615 --> 01:17:12.495]  But, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:17:12.655 --> 01:17:14.556]  Trump really failed buying into the vaccines.
[01:17:14.956 --> 01:17:16.517]  He thought he could reopen the economy that way.
[01:17:16.537 --> 01:17:19.418]  He said old folks shouldn't take it, you know, or maybe they should.
[01:17:19.478 --> 01:17:20.218]  Young people shouldn't.
[01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:23.520]  But he put provisos in, but I agree that was one of his biggest failures.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:33.104]  And yeah, they now have confirmed that if you take the mRNA, Pfizer, or Moderna vaccine, or some of the others, four of them,
[01:17:34.301 --> 01:17:39.744]  That it causes an autoimmune response later to any regular cold and will kill you.
[01:17:40.484 --> 01:17:42.865]  So yeah, this is big, folks.
[01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:45.767]  She's a really smart caller.
[01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:51.230]  I was thinking this morning, how are they going to spin the millions of deaths that are going to be caused from this?
[01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:53.251]  Because it's already happening.
[01:17:54.211 --> 01:17:55.172]  How are they going to do it?
[01:17:56.305 --> 01:18:04.432]  They're gonna call it another strain and claim another strain's doing it, and set the test, the PCR test, which they set falsely, to be able to cover that up.
[01:18:04.833 --> 01:18:07.835]  So that'll be the second wave that Gates talked about.
[01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:10.097]  In six months, a year, he said that'll kill ten times more.
[01:18:10.117 --> 01:18:12.439]  It'll be a real weapon, is that you've taken the vaccine.
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.223]  Now the regular cold virus causes autoimmune response and kills you.
[01:18:16.923 --> 01:18:18.184]  Man, that's sophisticated!
[01:18:18.605 --> 01:18:20.366]  Yeah, South Africa just suspended the
[01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:23.834]  AstraZeneca one saying it just doesn't work.
[01:18:23.974 --> 01:18:24.995]  Not even in 5%.
[01:18:25.975 --> 01:18:27.056]  France is suspending it.
[01:18:27.456 --> 01:18:28.557]  Australia suspended it.
[01:18:29.357 --> 01:18:31.118]  Because it's all a lie, but they don't care.
[01:18:31.138 --> 01:18:34.500]  They're rolling forward only for America and Europe.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.401]  My God!
[01:18:37.061 --> 01:18:38.062]  This is big, folks.
[01:18:38.082 --> 01:18:39.903]  I haven't figured out every angle of it, but it's big.
[01:18:40.363 --> 01:18:40.943]  Thank you, Catherine.
[01:18:41.544 --> 01:18:44.285]  Harry in Oklahoma has a COVID-19 personal experience.
[01:18:44.545 --> 01:18:45.926]  Harry, get right into it, brother.
[01:18:47.404 --> 01:18:48.385]  Alex, how's it going, man?
[01:18:48.425 --> 01:18:49.686]  Thanks for having me on there.
[01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:55.191]  I mean, I feel like I'm like, I feel like I'm like a commentator at the end of the world or something.
[01:18:55.371 --> 01:18:56.892]  I don't even feel like I should be on air.
[01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:57.392]  It's so insane.
[01:18:57.412 --> 01:18:58.473]  I feel like I should be with my family.
[01:18:59.794 --> 01:19:02.517]  I mean, that's what it's looking like right now, you know, and times are coming.
[01:19:02.817 --> 01:19:02.997]  Yeah.
[01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:04.738]  So tell us what happened, brother.
[01:19:04.758 --> 01:19:05.299]  Thanks for calling.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.541]  Of course.
[01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:11.064]  So yeah, the COVID thing, or that's what they say anyway, right?
[01:19:11.204 --> 01:19:15.147]  It was a PCR test at the local health department.
[01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:21.431]  Well, I went to go call the actual lab because they sent it off to a different lab to be tested.
[01:19:21.911 --> 01:19:28.073]  I called the lab and I asked them what the cycle threshold was on their testing, and they said it was 40.
[01:19:28.753 --> 01:19:32.074]  And so that means they multiplied whatever they found.
[01:19:32.094 --> 01:19:37.996]  For those that don't know, almost all tests are positive at 40 or higher amplitudes.
[01:19:39.476 --> 01:19:39.936]  Right, right.
[01:19:40.216 --> 01:19:45.838]  And I think that's like 240 times multiplied, you know, whatever they find in there.
[01:19:46.844 --> 01:19:51.247]  And so right away, you know, I know that it's ridiculous.
[01:19:52.127 --> 01:20:03.935]  But then the state called me, you know, doing their contact tracing thing, and I was going over my symptoms, and I said, you know what, I really think it was just a case of the flu.
[01:20:04.335 --> 01:20:07.437]  And she goes, yeah, yeah, that's what it is, you know, the flu.
[01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.333]  And I laughed, you know, made me laugh.
[01:20:10.353 --> 01:20:13.797]  It's just crazy, man, what's going on with the testing.
[01:20:13.817 --> 01:20:17.941]  Well, notice they say flus, they're an all-time 130-year low.
[01:20:17.981 --> 01:20:20.804]  It's just nowhere now because they count all flu as COVID.
[01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:27.273]  And what's crazy is every nurse and every doctor I talk to says that they know it's true.
[01:20:27.593 --> 01:20:28.773]  I have family that works at the VA.
[01:20:28.853 --> 01:20:29.594]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:20:29.914 --> 01:20:30.774]  Some distant family.
[01:20:30.794 --> 01:20:34.636]  Well, I'm close to them, but they're a distant family, cousin-wise.
[01:20:35.057 --> 01:20:42.140]  And they're like, yeah, we've had one death in the VA the last year here in this major city, but still we wear spacesuits and still COVID's real, Alex.
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:42.860]  You should worry about it.
[01:20:43.221 --> 01:20:43.721]  And I go, really?
[01:20:43.741 --> 01:20:44.721]  How many flu deaths you had?
[01:20:44.741 --> 01:20:45.262]  Oh, hundreds.
[01:20:45.682 --> 01:20:46.642]  All these old vets dying.
[01:20:46.843 --> 01:20:49.544]  I mean, it's just that the logic is dead with these people.
[01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:58.891]  Well, we're on the CDC website where they post, for only 6% of the deaths, you know, the comorbidities.
[01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:09.758]  They, at the very bottom, they include hundreds of these ICD-10 codes that says all other conditions and causes, and one whole section is about mental disabilities.
[01:21:09.778 --> 01:21:13.921]  I'm like, how does a mental disability cause a COVID death?
[01:21:13.961 --> 01:21:16.223]  You know, it's mind-boggling.
[01:21:18.134 --> 01:21:21.036]  Brother, they could have put out a real weapon.
[01:21:21.096 --> 01:21:24.138]  They do this with fraud to get everybody used to going along with fraud.
[01:21:24.438 --> 01:21:25.499]  That's why they attack logic.
[01:21:25.539 --> 01:21:38.988]  That's why they have huge men that I'm not as strong as that are like, obviously, Schwarzenegger types or Lou Ferrigno types in women's weightlifting, wrestling, boxing, jiu-jitsu.
[01:21:39.609 --> 01:21:40.909]  And like, these are huge dudes.
[01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:42.651]  It would be a gorilla in a field house.
[01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.712]  Like, these dudes would be gorillas when I played football in Dallas.
[01:21:46.152 --> 01:21:53.976]  Like, they're the linemen of the- and they're literally in rings with little girls, smashing their heads in the ground, and we're saying, oh, aren't there little girls?
[01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:56.997]  They don't even have frickin' pigtails on, man!
[01:21:57.737 --> 01:22:01.039]  It's like that South Park episode where Macho Man's beating up little girls.
[01:22:01.719 --> 01:22:03.060]  And so, they know what they're doing.
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.961]  So, obviously, you're calling to this show, Harry.
[01:22:06.001 --> 01:22:06.521]  Great job.
[01:22:06.561 --> 01:22:08.082]  Are other folks waking up?
[01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:10.780]  I think so.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:16.985]  In fact, I'm glad you asked because I went to ban video and I was downloading all of your videos because it said to download.
[01:22:17.605 --> 01:22:20.188]  And I was cutting them up myself and sharing them on TikTok.
[01:22:21.529 --> 01:22:26.253]  And I racked up about a quarter of a million views before they banned my page.
[01:22:26.273 --> 01:22:31.017]  But I'm glad I was able to do that, you know, sort of share your message as well.
[01:22:32.028 --> 01:22:34.249]  Well, you understand that you're the key.
[01:22:34.309 --> 01:22:35.009]  Don't just say this.
[01:22:35.389 --> 01:22:43.912]  When the audience re-uploads, gets another cell phone, uses a web server, anonymous system, then you can keep doing it from the same phone over and over again.
[01:22:44.232 --> 01:22:45.452]  Just keep creating new accounts.
[01:22:45.512 --> 01:22:47.013]  Keep rebuilding them.
[01:22:47.393 --> 01:22:48.833]  Every time they blow it away, it's okay.
[01:22:48.873 --> 01:22:49.653]  Rebuild it again.
[01:22:49.974 --> 01:22:51.254]  And that's how we're reaching new people.
[01:22:51.274 --> 01:22:54.235]  I don't even want to say on air where we're really reaching people right now.
[01:22:55.293 --> 01:23:00.178]  But let's just say, well, the enemy already knows, but underground stuff in China, we're huge.
[01:23:00.218 --> 01:23:01.719]  We're talking 100 million views a day.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.145]  India, 100 million views plus a day on underground channels, hundreds of millions on the public channels.
[01:23:07.525 --> 01:23:09.447]  And people are like, well, you don't make any money off China or India.
[01:23:09.527 --> 01:23:10.608]  I don't give a rat's ass.
[01:23:10.628 --> 01:23:11.669]  They're humans with souls.
[01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.750]  I want to reach them.
[01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:14.071]  So I get a thrill.
[01:23:14.992 --> 01:23:16.053]  And the globalists already know this.
[01:23:16.333 --> 01:23:17.875]  They had articles like, Jones got
[01:23:18.315 --> 01:23:20.177]  50 million views in Hungary last week!
[01:23:20.457 --> 01:23:21.678]  He's gotta be banned!
[01:23:22.238 --> 01:23:32.666]  So we are devastating them because of people in Romania and Hungary and the Czech Republic and Germany and Russia and Japan and Africa, you know, countries.
[01:23:32.706 --> 01:23:35.888]  We're huge in Africa, which again, I make no money off Africans.
[01:23:36.028 --> 01:23:36.508]  I don't care.
[01:23:36.608 --> 01:23:45.255]  I love the fact that in Nigeria and the fact in Congo and the fact in South Africa and everywhere, and it's because of you, Harry.
[01:23:45.555 --> 01:23:46.275]  It's because of you.
[01:23:46.315 --> 01:23:46.836]  God bless you.
[01:23:47.858 --> 01:23:49.319]  You have no idea what you're doing, folks.
[01:23:49.619 --> 01:23:51.520]  We are overriding the AI together.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.161]  It is beautiful.
[01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:54.242]  That's the modern war we're part of.
[01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:58.724]  InfoWars has exploded in India.
[01:23:59.185 --> 01:23:59.865]  Let's go ahead.
[01:23:59.885 --> 01:24:04.268]  It's been big for a while, but good luck, New World Order.
[01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:08.630]  Oh my goodness.
[01:24:09.971 --> 01:24:10.952]  Let's take another caller.
[01:24:10.992 --> 01:24:11.732]  Who's up next?
[01:24:13.373 --> 01:24:14.594]  Let's talk to Tyler about
[01:24:15.578 --> 01:24:17.599]  The Catholic Church rolled the reset.
[01:24:17.839 --> 01:24:21.360]  Well, yeah, I mean, the new Pope is basically Satan on Earth.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:22.781]  Give us your view, Tyler.
[01:24:24.181 --> 01:24:24.501]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:24.521 --> 01:24:25.502]  Let me give you a quick plug.
[01:24:25.522 --> 01:24:27.663]  I've been on viral mental infusion now for about a month.
[01:24:27.683 --> 01:24:28.843]  It's changing my life.
[01:24:28.923 --> 01:24:29.483]  Things are great.
[01:24:29.503 --> 01:24:30.244]  I sleep good.
[01:24:30.704 --> 01:24:31.324]  All that stuff.
[01:24:31.904 --> 01:24:35.545]  So, I don't want anybody to get offended, and I feel like people do this a lot.
[01:24:35.606 --> 01:24:41.308]  You know, when you kind of talk about their religion, they tend to take it very personal, and we don't need to do that.
[01:24:42.028 --> 01:24:43.929]  Because in the Bible, in Revelation, it talks about
[01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:48.912]  You know, all the sheep will come from different flocks, you know, when the time comes.
[01:24:49.052 --> 01:24:53.235]  So, your particular denomination is not going to matter, so don't get offended.
[01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:59.639]  And we all know how corrupt the Catholic Church is, and how much influence they've had on the world for hundreds of years.
[01:25:00.459 --> 01:25:09.805]  So, when you're reading Revelation, and you start talking about the end, you know, persecuting Christians, you know, we're not going to be able to buy and sell.
[01:25:10.765 --> 01:25:13.307]  The Catholic Church has already talked about this in the New Green Deal.
[01:25:14.144 --> 01:25:14.764]  Stay there!
[01:25:14.784 --> 01:25:15.124]  Don't hang up!
[01:25:15.204 --> 01:25:15.965]  Don't hang up!
[01:25:16.005 --> 01:25:19.206]  I'm gonna come back, finish your call, take a few more, and then...
[01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:34.736]  I've got this report we're going to air while we're getting Jay Dyer in the seat in here.
[01:25:35.036 --> 01:25:36.357]  They want your guns.
[01:25:36.557 --> 01:25:40.119]  Very powerful by John Bowne, who has really upped his game.
[01:25:40.139 --> 01:25:43.481]  He's always done a great job, but now as things get more intense, he's upped his game.
[01:25:43.761 --> 01:25:45.862]  Because you never know if it's the last InfoWars broadcast.
[01:25:46.283 --> 01:25:47.503]  I never used to talk like that, did I?
[01:25:47.984 --> 01:25:49.284]  Every show is a blessing now.
[01:25:49.304 --> 01:25:50.665]  We appreciate you magnifying it.
[01:25:50.885 --> 01:25:51.506]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:52.726 --> 01:26:00.471]  Now, I have a lot of people I respect that fight tyranny, that are Catholics, that are Protestants, that are Hindus, that are Buddhists.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.102]  I try not to judge people by what affiliation they have.
[01:26:05.142 --> 01:26:06.503]  I judge them off what they stand for.
[01:26:06.704 --> 01:26:11.187]  And some of the best people I know in the fight against the globalists, it's not some tokenism, have been Catholic.
[01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:16.250]  And they're all really upset and hate this current Pope who the former Pope says is basically the Antichrist.
[01:26:16.631 --> 01:26:20.333]  He's locked up in Gandalf Castle and he's got his own issues.
[01:26:21.154 --> 01:26:24.897]  But this new Pope is the Antichrist compared to what Christ said.
[01:26:25.457 --> 01:26:27.038]  Antichrist means inverting Christ.
[01:26:27.098 --> 01:26:29.060]  Well, I mean, this Pope is a devil.
[01:26:30.014 --> 01:26:30.814]  And the left loves him.
[01:26:31.694 --> 01:26:36.656]  So the caller doesn't have to apologize for bringing that up about the current Pope.
[01:26:37.056 --> 01:26:39.676]  Now there's Pope Benedict, terrified of the new Pope.
[01:26:40.177 --> 01:26:40.877]  Terrified!
[01:26:41.757 --> 01:26:45.318]  I mean, it's literally like, we shouldn't be so Christian in Europe.
[01:26:45.818 --> 01:26:47.198]  We need to get rid of the family.
[01:26:49.119 --> 01:26:50.419]  Marriage is for men and men too.
[01:26:50.439 --> 01:26:51.920]  I mean, it's all crap.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.440]  Total crap.
[01:26:54.727 --> 01:26:56.608]  And so they're making their move.
[01:26:56.648 --> 01:27:01.871]  And so I would say the Catholic Church run by the Globalist is the Tom Brady of the New World Order.
[01:27:02.472 --> 01:27:05.113]  I mean, it's not just a quarterback.
[01:27:05.734 --> 01:27:06.934]  It's more important than a coach.
[01:27:07.034 --> 01:27:07.855]  It's a leader.
[01:27:08.736 --> 01:27:10.336]  It is at the heart.
[01:27:11.997 --> 01:27:12.618]  Is that even real?
[01:27:13.098 --> 01:27:14.319]  It is at the heart of it.
[01:27:14.359 --> 01:27:16.180]  And what it is is a big pedophile network.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.822]  They have successfully taken the Catholic Church over.
[01:27:19.142 --> 01:27:21.283]  But they're all pedophiles.
[01:27:21.463 --> 01:27:22.564]  It's everywhere, folks.
[01:27:22.744 --> 01:27:24.145]  They're taking everything over with it.
[01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:26.211]  And it's really despicable.
[01:27:26.752 --> 01:27:29.013]  So Tyler, finish up your point about the Catholic Church.
[01:27:55.512 --> 01:27:59.294]  So, everybody just needs to go home and read and really pay attention.
[01:27:59.814 --> 01:28:01.034]  Just get down to the fundamentals.
[01:28:01.255 --> 01:28:14.000]  So, you're going to have the Catholic Church come in with, uh, sorry, the New Green Deal talking about, we all need to have this national... Oh, they already called for a global alliance for the Great Reset.
[01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:14.661]  They already said that.
[01:28:15.721 --> 01:28:15.901]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:28:16.802 --> 01:28:24.345]  So, what they're going to say is, everyone across the globe has to worship on this single particular day because the Catholic Church says so.
[01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:33.115]  And if you worship on any other day in any other way, aside from what... And that's part of the global lockdowns is getting us ready for the state merge with religion to direct us.
[01:28:33.175 --> 01:28:33.855]  I totally agree.
[01:28:34.996 --> 01:28:35.236]  Yeah.
[01:28:35.336 --> 01:28:37.636]  So everybody just really needs to pay attention and be observant.
[01:28:37.656 --> 01:28:40.117]  So the path to destruction is going to be broad.
[01:28:40.717 --> 01:28:42.778]  You know, the path to righteousness is going to be narrow.
[01:28:42.858 --> 01:28:51.660]  So when you start seeing all the persecution take place, when there's a huge group of people that's safe and everything's fine, they're just going along with this.
[01:28:52.949 --> 01:28:56.312]  No, I agree.
[01:28:56.352 --> 01:28:57.874]  The way is definitely wide.
[01:28:57.954 --> 01:29:00.417]  And boy, is it not now a time to wake up?
[01:29:00.437 --> 01:29:02.959]  I mean, how obvious is it all now that the Bible's the real deal?
[01:29:04.361 --> 01:29:06.723]  Yeah, Alex, I really appreciate what you guys are doing.
[01:29:07.144 --> 01:29:08.905]  I'll make sure and tell everybody about your show.
[01:29:09.106 --> 01:29:11.588]  I don't care when I get called a nut for listening to you.
[01:29:12.129 --> 01:29:14.111]  Everybody keep on your ten-fold hat.
[01:29:14.738 --> 01:29:15.438]  God bless you, brother.
[01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:17.259]  Yeah, I'll be honest with you.
[01:29:17.499 --> 01:29:18.099]  I'm obnoxious.
[01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:18.779]  I have problems.
[01:29:19.039 --> 01:29:21.119]  I can't, I mean, this is so real now.
[01:29:21.139 --> 01:29:24.060]  I always knew it was real, but I thought we were going to hold it back maybe for a while.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:28.761]  The fact that we're going to have this now, not in our lifetime, but the next decade.
[01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:34.522]  I mean, it's, it's, I'm just upset that everybody's going along with it and that people are so pliant.
[01:29:35.983 --> 01:29:37.483]  And then I just look at the globalists.
[01:29:38.519 --> 01:29:44.880]  How unhappy they are and how they have like way higher suicide with their kids and they're so miserable.
[01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.521]  And I know people that know the Clintons and the Pelosi's and just all of them.
[01:29:50.541 --> 01:29:51.482]  They're just miserable.
[01:29:51.822 --> 01:29:55.062]  I mean, I've sat there at parties with the top Hollywood people.
[01:29:55.082 --> 01:29:56.382]  I've been invited to a bunch of their houses.
[01:29:56.843 --> 01:29:58.903]  Charlie Sheen was the only guy that actually wanted to go on air with us.
[01:29:58.943 --> 01:30:00.443]  But I mean, people way bigger than Charlie Sheen.
[01:30:00.743 --> 01:30:01.884]  And they're all miserable.
[01:30:02.524 --> 01:30:03.944]  It's Kim Trills and Country Club.
[01:30:05.885 --> 01:30:09.086]  I mean, it is just like, there's nothing there.
[01:30:09.126 --> 01:30:10.247]  The new order has nothing to offer.
[01:30:10.507 --> 01:30:13.448]  People are like, oh gosh, Hollywood, the elite, it's some great thing.
[01:30:13.488 --> 01:30:14.669]  There's nothing there.
[01:30:15.269 --> 01:30:16.070]  There's nothing.
[01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:18.391]  And that's why they're shutting everything down.
[01:30:18.431 --> 01:30:19.351]  This is the key I'm going to explain.
[01:30:19.911 --> 01:30:25.194]  They want exclusivity to lock us all down so they can be free because they never had exclusivity.
[01:30:25.914 --> 01:30:26.754]  You understand how that works?
[01:30:26.834 --> 01:30:27.435]  I'll explain it later.
[01:30:27.835 --> 01:30:28.455]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:28.475 --> 01:30:28.835]  Stay with us.
[01:30:30.076 --> 01:30:32.197]  Come on, come on, come on!
[01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:42.453]  The Mockingbird Media's anti-American privileged twits are casually calling for the drone strike of a former American president.
[01:30:42.593 --> 01:30:45.254]  We had a policy and it was very controversial.
[01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:48.456]  It was carried out under the Bush years and under the Obama years.
[01:30:49.656 --> 01:31:02.426]  How does Mitch McConnell, who understands that the way you root out terrorism is to take on, in the case of Islamic terrorism, kill those who incite it, how does he not vote to convict someone that he said, on the floor of the Senate, incited an insurrection?
[01:31:18.999 --> 01:31:24.345]  Former CIA Director John Brennan is declaring open season on Americans.
[01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:30.952]  No looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed
[01:31:31.856 --> 01:31:56.694]  Are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas, where they germinate in different parts of the country and they gain strength and it brings together an unholy alliance frequently of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists, even libertarians.
[01:31:57.154 --> 01:32:01.117]  We're witnessing the cancer culture purge being kicked into overdrive here.
[01:32:01.617 --> 01:32:12.323]  So I am concerned at a movement right now to basically paint a broad brush and accuse 74 million Americans, basically, that voted for President Trump and label them as insurgents.
[01:32:12.663 --> 01:32:22.630]  Know-it-all pseudo-comedian Bill Maher is driving the knife in, now blaming all Christian Americans for the hyped-up insurrection on January 6th.
[01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:26.032]  The events of January 6th were a faith-based initiative.
[01:32:26.852 --> 01:32:33.659]  And Trumpism is a Christian nationalist movement that believes Trump was literally sent from heaven to save them.
[01:32:34.339 --> 01:32:46.551]  There's a lot of talk now in liberal quarters about how Republicans should tell their base, who still believe the election was rigged, that they need to grow up and move on and stop asking the rest of us to respect their mass delusion.
[01:32:47.392 --> 01:32:48.873]  And of course it is a mass delusion.
[01:32:49.813 --> 01:33:00.478]  But the inconvenient truth here is that if you accord religious faith the kind of exalted respect we do here in America, you've already lost the argument that mass delusion is bad.
[01:33:01.398 --> 01:33:11.162]  Bolshevik wannabes, Antifa and BLM strengthened by a Nobel Peace Prize nomination, are routinely threatening to burn down America.
[01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:23.957]  Murder rates, home invasions, carjackings, and random robberies are skyrocketing across the country.
[01:33:24.618 --> 01:33:29.439]  The number of people killed in Minneapolis is up 95% from the same time last summer.
[01:33:29.559 --> 01:33:35.362]  Since the beginning of the year, there have been more than 150 carjackings in Chicago.
[01:33:35.802 --> 01:33:38.263]  The murder rate in Phoenix is skyrocketing.
[01:33:38.663 --> 01:33:44.065]  We've seen 144 so far this year, meaning we are just behind Chicago.
[01:33:44.705 --> 01:33:47.867]  And we have a warning from Philadelphia Police for you this afternoon.
[01:33:47.967 --> 01:33:56.372]  Carjackings have skyrocketed in the city, up 82% from last year, and there have already been 28 incidents this year alone.
[01:33:56.632 --> 01:33:59.174]  In Minneapolis, carjackings have spiked roughly 320%.
[01:34:01.195 --> 01:34:07.039]  Compared to this time last year, carjackings in New Orleans up 150% year-to-date.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:13.885]  New York City has seen 311 carjackings, up from 129 a year ago.
[01:34:14.265 --> 01:34:23.732]  While Joe Biden has transformed our southern border into a global destination for every horror Europe has endured for the past 10 years.
[01:34:24.192 --> 01:34:30.477]  We'd arrived with counterterrorism specialist Jason Jones to find war raging on America's doorstep.
[01:34:34.019 --> 01:34:34.682]  Oh, there you go.
[01:34:34.722 --> 01:34:34.983]  There's a .40.
[01:34:35.204 --> 01:34:35.907]  Did you hear the .40?
[01:34:35.987 --> 01:34:36.308]  Yes.
[01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:37.653]  That was a .40-millimeter grenade.
[01:34:37.713 --> 01:34:38.777]  That was a grenade, yeah.
[01:34:39.099 --> 01:34:39.319]  Yeah.
[01:34:42.334 --> 01:34:56.407]  It's perfect timing for Americans to have their Second Amendment rights diminished and police defunded so that we can't protect ourselves from an escalating crime trend that is threatening our very existence.
[01:34:56.687 --> 01:35:05.735]  Biden plans a gun safety crackdown on day one, asking Congress to repeal liability protections for gun makers and close loopholes for background checks.
[01:35:10.294 --> 01:35:19.859]  He also wants to ban production of assault weapons, require registration for some guns, limit gun purchases to one per month, and end all online sales.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:29.403]  I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.
[01:35:29.463 --> 01:35:33.004]  And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.
[01:35:33.784 --> 01:35:45.328]  And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns.
[01:35:46.306 --> 01:35:53.551]  I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license.
[01:35:53.571 --> 01:35:57.974]  Texas Representative Sheila Jackson Lee has introduced H.R.
[01:35:58.875 --> 01:36:12.504]  127, essentially a psych evaluation for you and two immediate family members in order for you to have the privilege of owning a heavily regulated and taxed firearm in the Democrats' New America.
[01:36:12.904 --> 01:36:26.136]  And as liberal death traps propose gun reforms and buyback programs, states like Missouri are refusing to succumb to the anti-Second Amendment rollout by Joe Biden's federal overlords.
[01:36:26.577 --> 01:36:27.417]  As the St.
[01:36:27.457 --> 01:36:34.804]  Louis Dispatch reported, the Missouri House gave first-round approval to a proposal that would prevent local law enforcement
[01:36:34.804 --> 01:36:35.004]  I'm good.
[01:36:51.832 --> 01:36:52.813]  Reality check.
[01:36:52.953 --> 01:37:05.579]  The fact that Missouri even has to propose Second Amendment protections from the federal government barely three weeks into Joe Biden's dictatorship signals it's going to be a long four years.
[01:37:06.039 --> 01:37:07.300]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:37:08.661 --> 01:37:09.421]  Alright, folks.
[01:37:10.301 --> 01:37:10.862]  We are here.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:13.160]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.641]  Jay Dyer is a talk show host in his own right.
[01:37:15.781 --> 01:37:17.342]  Author, researcher, really smart guy.
[01:37:17.402 --> 01:37:25.664]  He's read all the old literature I have and the modern stuff, but also the current stuff, because I have a bad habit of not really covering what the global is actually right these days.
[01:37:25.704 --> 01:37:27.865]  It's more of the same, but more intense, more in your face.
[01:37:28.285 --> 01:37:30.485]  The Great Reset, the New World Order, all of it.
[01:37:32.406 --> 01:37:33.506]  So good to have you here with us.
[01:37:33.526 --> 01:37:35.427]  You're going to be hosting the fourth hour here today.
[01:37:37.378 --> 01:37:40.239]  What would you call this period of time we're in right now?
[01:37:40.319 --> 01:37:41.140]  I think it's pretty clear.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.601]  They're saying patriots are terrorists.
[01:37:43.621 --> 01:37:44.721]  They're going to arrest us all.
[01:37:45.402 --> 01:37:46.722]  We're about to stage terror attacks.
[01:37:46.742 --> 01:37:48.503]  Clearly, they're getting ready to stage terror attacks.
[01:37:48.843 --> 01:37:49.884]  In my view, do you agree with that?
[01:37:49.944 --> 01:37:52.205]  And what would you call this period of time we're in?
[01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:53.866]  And what are you doing to get ready for it?
[01:37:53.886 --> 01:37:57.267]  Because every few generations goes through some real tyranny.
[01:37:57.287 --> 01:37:58.728]  We're about to go through a big one.
[01:37:59.568 --> 01:38:01.409]  This is the age of transition, right?
[01:38:01.449 --> 01:38:17.757]  This is their phraseology for how we go from the way things were during this Christian period of the age of, you know, Pisces, the age of the fish, to the Aquarian age, which is what Blavatsky, right, one of the esoteric philosophers that the elite always liked to look to.
[01:38:17.797 --> 01:38:20.179]  She called this the externalization of the hierarchy.
[01:38:20.659 --> 01:38:26.662]  Annie Besant, a lot of these UN-promoted New Agers have this same idea, which is a kind of a Luciferian era.
[01:38:27.082 --> 01:38:33.148]  So that's really the big picture spiritual attitude that I think we're being, you know, propagandized with.
[01:38:33.188 --> 01:38:35.030]  So what I'm doing is it's time to repent.
[01:38:35.110 --> 01:38:38.253]  I mean, I spent a lot of years in my 20s and 30s partying.
[01:38:38.293 --> 01:38:44.319]  And then as you get older, you realize it's time to not live that way because we're going into a new era.
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.724]  And that era is going to be the erasing of the old and hence the Great Reset.
[01:38:49.834 --> 01:38:53.116]  And the Luciferians talk about human empowerment, but what they're bringing is bondage.
[01:38:53.136 --> 01:38:53.936]  Right, exactly.
[01:38:53.996 --> 01:38:56.078]  It's to go away from the human.
[01:38:56.098 --> 01:38:58.639]  I was just reading, of all people, Che Guevara.
[01:38:58.919 --> 01:39:03.322]  And Che has this weird essay where he says, we're going to bring in the new man.
[01:39:04.082 --> 01:39:06.403]  And you think, well, isn't that a Nietzschean concept?
[01:39:06.443 --> 01:39:08.805]  I thought Nietzsche doesn't really work with communism well.
[01:39:08.845 --> 01:39:12.727]  But the irony is that they both have the idea of transcending the human.
[01:39:13.467 --> 01:39:16.988]  And the only difference is that for Che, it was all of the collective.
[01:39:17.148 --> 01:39:19.589]  The collective will evolve into being this new man.
[01:39:19.729 --> 01:39:20.309]  We'll be right back.
[01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:22.950]  JaysAnalysis.com.
[01:39:23.150 --> 01:39:24.051]  YouTube Jay Dyer.
[01:39:24.071 --> 01:39:29.472]  Jay Dyer is an author, comedian, TV presenter known for his deep analysis of Hollywood, geopolitics, and culture.
[01:39:29.492 --> 01:39:30.373]  He is a smart guy.
[01:39:30.953 --> 01:39:33.634]  His graduate work focused on psychological warfare in film.
[01:39:33.694 --> 01:39:40.116]  He is the author of two books, Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, and the co-creator of Coe's television show, Hollywood Decoded.
[01:39:41.303 --> 01:39:42.883]  So, let's talk about you a little bit.
[01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:45.164]  How did you wake up, and then what is it like?
[01:39:45.184 --> 01:39:47.245]  Because I'm having to deal with this every day.
[01:39:48.385 --> 01:39:52.466]  To know it's coming, to know we're in the beta test for this, and now go over the cliff.
[01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:53.926]  I think you agree, we're in it now.
[01:39:53.966 --> 01:39:55.587]  It's going to accelerate from here on out.
[01:39:56.447 --> 01:39:57.908]  All the big secrets are going to come out.
[01:39:58.068 --> 01:39:59.168]  Just total insanity.
[01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:05.975]  What was it like to wake up and now what is it like to, because you've been around a long time, and now to see it all accelerating.
[01:40:06.195 --> 01:40:06.755]  It's wild.
[01:40:06.796 --> 01:40:14.521]  I remember I was looking at the library in there and I was seeing some of the books that I read years and years ago that you recommended that you talked about back in 2003.
[01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:18.764]  I started watching your stuff when you were still Cable Access.
[01:40:19.785 --> 01:40:36.876]  Uh, and you had the radio show, and I noticed that you talked a lot about skull and bones, and so I was going to college at the time, and, you know, I was mentioning philosophy before the break, studying philosophy, and we would be reading Nietzsche, we'd be reading the communists, of course the professors want you to read all the communists, and the commonality I noticed is that they all were anti-human.
[01:40:37.196 --> 01:40:41.738]  They all wanted to transcend what it was to be man, what it was to be human.
[01:40:41.758 --> 01:40:42.519]  They were all gonna fix us!
[01:40:42.879 --> 01:40:43.560]  Exactly.
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.562]  So that's the great work of the alchemist, right?
[01:40:45.582 --> 01:40:52.609]  And I had some classes on alchemy, Elizabethan era alchemy, which is actually even in Shakespeare, right?
[01:40:52.649 --> 01:40:59.837]  So we had this Shakespeare class, we're talking about alchemy, and at the same time I'm taking these classes that dealt with, you know, philosophy, transhumanism, right?
[01:40:59.877 --> 01:41:01.598]  And then you did that documentary.
[01:41:02.339 --> 01:41:06.421]  A few years later, right, Endgame, and you were talking about how the idea was to become post-human.
[01:41:06.881 --> 01:41:08.542]  And I'm learning this in my classes.
[01:41:08.602 --> 01:41:11.704]  I'm seeing it in all these films that I'm watching as a film buff.
[01:41:12.164 --> 01:41:17.126]  And so you realize that it's real, and to get to that end goal, they have to do all kinds of crises.
[01:41:17.566 --> 01:41:20.588]  And that's when I branched out sort of reading the books that you talked about.
[01:41:20.648 --> 01:41:25.030]  And they say we're going to use viruses, we're going to use third world hordes, and financial collapse.
[01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:28.292]  Yeah, one of the ones you recommended was Brzezinski.
[01:41:28.352 --> 01:41:30.333]  I read Brzezinski across the board.
[01:41:30.373 --> 01:41:38.697]  I remember him talking about this plan of what he called Arc of Crisis, and that was to bring in all these crises which are intentional, which are staged.
[01:41:39.258 --> 01:41:44.040]  What that does is that destabilizes society and then it leads to that Hegelian synthesis.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:44.961]  So you get this thesis.
[01:41:45.461 --> 01:41:48.322]  You get the antithesis and then you blend it together with that synthesis.
[01:41:48.582 --> 01:41:52.564]  I was literally taking classes on Hegel at the time that I watched your documentaries.
[01:41:52.924 --> 01:41:56.626]  And they were talking about that process which leads to this convergence.
[01:41:56.866 --> 01:41:59.627]  And then you go and you read these big books like Tragedy and Hope and they talk about the same thing.
[01:41:59.647 --> 01:42:08.831]  They talk about how to bring about the third wave which is blending Eastern Communism with Western Capitalism to this technocratic globalist order.
[01:42:09.651 --> 01:42:12.114]  And the average liberal thinks, though, communism means I get free stuff.
[01:42:12.174 --> 01:42:12.334]  No.
[01:42:12.875 --> 01:42:23.266]  Once they lock things down, once you have a tracker app, then they can start making you do what they want to have the tracker app, which means takes the vaccine, which is, again, a sterilant, a cancer virus, whatever they want.
[01:42:23.587 --> 01:42:26.170]  I mean, they're accelerating to their endgame very quickly.
[01:42:26.687 --> 01:42:28.629]  Yeah, and that's why those crises were so important.
[01:42:28.649 --> 01:42:34.433]  One of the things that you notice across the board with all these global elite ridings is they talk about crisis, crisis, crisis, crisis.
[01:42:34.834 --> 01:42:49.546]  And most of the time, not always, but most of the time, the crisis is intentional, it's fostered, it's a destabilization effort, it's going back to Gladio, it's like the false flags stuff that you were talking about earlier with what's coming against Patriots, right against those on the right, the Conservatives.
[01:42:50.046 --> 01:42:53.369]  That's all a Gladio model stuff that they're going to rehash and redo.
[01:42:53.389 --> 01:42:55.411]  False flags, let's talk about that in a moment, but first...
[01:42:56.775 --> 01:43:04.845]  There's a natural development of humans towards better and building better and higher quality when we all individually get to act on our dreams.
[01:43:04.905 --> 01:43:05.726]  That's the Renaissance.
[01:43:06.247 --> 01:43:12.835]  They create crises to try to sabotage that and then only allow development in directions they want towards their greater power.
[01:43:13.116 --> 01:43:14.417]  And so that's the real issue with this.
[01:43:15.302 --> 01:43:24.488]  Yeah, I think if you look at something, I was just thinking about Ayn Rand, if you look at the character of John Galt, what he does with that, he has a breakaway civilization.
[01:43:24.508 --> 01:43:26.970]  And she was hanging out with Greenspan and the elite in her day.
[01:43:27.370 --> 01:43:29.792]  And so she kind of knew what they were up to and what they were planning.
[01:43:29.812 --> 01:43:31.633]  And so I think she encoded this.
[01:43:31.673 --> 01:43:33.514]  Talk about Ayn Rand, because that's what they're building.
[01:43:33.594 --> 01:43:36.236]  And they already admit it's going to be city-states that are private.
[01:43:36.856 --> 01:43:40.499]  Already a bunch of states are passing laws where big tech can build its own private cities.
[01:43:40.679 --> 01:43:41.440]  Guys, tie that in.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:43.261]  Big tech creating its own towns and cities.
[01:43:43.921 --> 01:43:45.022]  Explain that to people, what this means.
[01:43:45.162 --> 01:43:50.645]  Right, so in Atlas Shrugged you have this idea that the elite will kind of move away to their own breakaway civilization.
[01:43:50.685 --> 01:43:56.989]  They'll have all the high tech, they'll take all the inventions and like, you know, secret them away behind some mountain fortress or something like this.
[01:43:57.709 --> 01:44:07.915]  And the character of John Galt just kind of lets society collapse because society basically wants that communism, they want that ideal that's a utopian, that's a false gospel basically.
[01:44:08.335 --> 01:44:13.798]  And so what happens is that there's just sort of this allowance of collapse because of that false ideal.
[01:44:14.358 --> 01:44:24.940]  And then the elite kind of, kind of, you know... That's because they're running the communist system on record, and then they exempt themselves from it, and then make you beg to have entry into it.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.341]  Right, right, right.
[01:44:26.781 --> 01:44:31.302]  One thing that blew me away was when I found out that Mao was Yale in China.
[01:44:31.802 --> 01:44:32.142]  YALI.
[01:44:32.482 --> 01:44:38.803]  So that Yale actually had this skull and bones sort of extension that they set up in China, and Mao was part of that.
[01:44:38.883 --> 01:44:40.124]  So what prepped Mao for it?
[01:44:40.184 --> 01:44:41.804]  G.G.Ping's daughter under another name is at Harvard.
[01:44:42.304 --> 01:44:42.704]  There you go.
[01:44:42.864 --> 01:44:43.304]  Yeah, right.
[01:44:43.764 --> 01:44:45.605]  What's Kim Jong-un, right?
[01:44:45.625 --> 01:44:48.326]  Didn't he go to the Swiss 40 school?
[01:44:48.746 --> 01:44:57.569]  So you've got this pattern of the elite all kind of working at the same level and then sort of fostering these systems that are kind of cutouts in a way.
[01:44:57.609 --> 01:45:04.071]  I mean, I'm not trying to say that Maoism was good, but it was a system that the West fostered during the Cold War.
[01:45:04.171 --> 01:45:09.373]  OSS, you know, Bill Donovan, he even talks about in his autobiography, went there and helped set up Mao's guerrillas, right?
[01:45:09.653 --> 01:45:10.894]  With the Flying Tigers, all of it.
[01:45:11.034 --> 01:45:20.700]  But that was the thing, is they admit, it's not that we took Maoism from China to run things here now, the globalists did it there because the Chinese were slaves and were controlled so they could test it there.
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:26.404]  And that's because Skull & Bones, OSS, they- Because it wasn't Maoism, it was this corporate, fascist, communist- Right.
[01:45:26.524 --> 01:45:29.065]  And that largely had to do with the drug lanes.
[01:45:29.586 --> 01:45:29.766]  Right?
[01:45:29.806 --> 01:45:34.829]  So it was about the intelligence agencies controlling those drug networks and those drug- And that goes back to Skull & Bones.
[01:45:35.069 --> 01:45:35.510]  Exactly.
[01:45:35.550 --> 01:45:36.370]  That's where they got their money.
[01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.710]  Yeah.
[01:45:37.091 --> 01:45:38.892]  And none of this is even classified.
[01:45:39.741 --> 01:45:44.304]  Well, I remember you mentioned it years ago, and you said it's on the CIA website.
[01:45:44.364 --> 01:45:45.365]  I went and found it.
[01:45:45.425 --> 01:45:46.486]  It's on the CIA website.
[01:45:46.506 --> 01:45:48.647]  There's a declassification of Donovan.
[01:45:48.667 --> 01:45:53.631]  They're training mouse guerrillas to go and fight, to set up these networks, basically.
[01:45:53.991 --> 01:45:54.691]  But that's the point.
[01:45:54.752 --> 01:46:01.937]  It's just that communism, these kinds of systems, and you can even pick it up in something like Ayn Rand's works, even though she's obviously anti-communist.
[01:46:02.197 --> 01:46:05.359]  You can still get the idea that they're not afraid of communism.
[01:46:05.379 --> 01:46:06.220]  They know what it's there to do.
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:07.861]  It serves its role.
[01:46:07.901 --> 01:46:09.182]  It serves its purpose.
[01:46:09.603 --> 01:46:17.411]  And my point was just that it's technocratic just as much as Nietzscheanism is ultimately technocratic, because it's about going past and being post-human, right?
[01:46:17.451 --> 01:46:25.920]  So if you had a college class or the professors in there telling you, we've got to be anti-natalist, we've got to be post-human, the human is what's the problem.
[01:46:26.943 --> 01:46:30.585]  And then you look at the people running it, most of them end up being in mental institutions when they die.
[01:46:31.205 --> 01:46:31.765]  Like Nietzsche.
[01:46:32.325 --> 01:46:35.046]  But I mean, most of these guys end up stark raving mad before they die.
[01:46:35.066 --> 01:46:40.569]  Yeah, he's like, he sees a horse, and some guy's beating a horse, and then he just loses his mind because some guy's beating a horse.
[01:46:40.649 --> 01:46:41.589]  I don't know why, but yes.
[01:46:43.050 --> 01:46:45.571]  Lenin, he ends up in a mental institute, wheeled around, howling.
[01:46:45.591 --> 01:46:46.471]  He would howl at the moon.
[01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:48.812]  I remember reading about that in Margaret Street's Lenin.
[01:46:48.832 --> 01:46:50.052]  He'd go out and howl at the moon at night.
[01:46:51.913 --> 01:46:53.154]  These people are insane.
[01:46:54.222 --> 01:47:02.108]  And the problem is there's a lot of high IQ people that are still insane and so they kind of just their own schizophrenia they project on the world.
[01:47:02.148 --> 01:47:06.251]  I want to ask you when we come back about this big story that broke on Friday that's so huge still.
[01:47:06.291 --> 01:47:09.693]  Thank God the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election.
[01:47:10.053 --> 01:47:11.875]  Time Magazine comes out and brags.
[01:47:12.535 --> 01:47:15.737]  And admits that it was all rigged and everything.
[01:47:15.897 --> 01:47:17.438]  Why do they do that?
[01:47:17.498 --> 01:47:20.319]  Jay Dyer is our guest, jaysanalysis.com.
[01:47:20.379 --> 01:47:25.482]  Find his books and more, Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, and the co-creator and co-host television show, Hollywood Decoded.
[01:47:25.902 --> 01:47:28.304]  Don't forget, we've got the websites, newswars.com.
[01:47:29.564 --> 01:47:32.004]  Infowars.com and Band.video.
[01:47:32.685 --> 01:47:33.905]  And I'm not a victim.
[01:47:33.945 --> 01:47:36.885]  I expect that we're under daily hack attacks, daily attempts to shut us down.
[01:47:36.905 --> 01:47:40.706]  So realize, every minute you promote the videos and the articles is a very special moment.
[01:47:41.066 --> 01:47:48.147]  And in the final segment this hour, before Jay Dyer takes over and hosts the fourth hour, we haven't named the report yet, but it's done, I'm told.
[01:47:48.207 --> 01:47:50.608]  I'm told it's going up on Infowars.com in the next 10 minutes.
[01:47:50.728 --> 01:47:51.568]  It is a big report.
[01:47:51.588 --> 01:47:57.429]  I've worked on it for three days, dealing with their plan to declare war on Americans and try to put us in FEMA camps.
[01:47:57.749 --> 01:47:58.329]  That's coming up.
[01:48:01.075 --> 01:48:04.637]  Jay Dyer is our guest, and let's talk cold hard facts.
[01:48:05.418 --> 01:48:06.559]  I think Trump meant well.
[01:48:06.619 --> 01:48:07.379]  He was a nationalist.
[01:48:07.419 --> 01:48:11.402]  He knew America was being screwed over, but that the establishment let him win.
[01:48:11.562 --> 01:48:20.508]  He did win by a landslide four years ago because they knew they could run circles around him and use him to energize the left to basically commit any crime.
[01:48:22.532 --> 01:48:26.216]  And then support a total police state and abandon any values they had.
[01:48:26.936 --> 01:48:33.762]  And I think that's clearly evident now, from my perspective, that at a sophisticated level we were all played.
[01:48:34.163 --> 01:48:37.506]  Trump himself, I know, was basically not part of that.
[01:48:37.546 --> 01:48:40.568]  He's very one-dimensional, actually at a good level.
[01:48:40.608 --> 01:48:44.632]  He really believes what he believes and is extremely pragmatic and tries to get it done.
[01:48:45.373 --> 01:48:47.515]  That's my view on this, but regardless,
[01:48:48.902 --> 01:48:53.163]  We are just, like I said, accelerating, plunging into this great tyranny.
[01:48:53.384 --> 01:48:54.684]  They're shutting off the economy.
[01:48:55.444 --> 01:49:03.167]  What are the supporters, A, what do you think of Trump, and then B, what do you think the supporters of Biden are going to do when they learn that all this free stuff they were told about isn't coming?
[01:49:04.249 --> 01:49:07.511]  I think Trump represents that older idea of Americana, right?
[01:49:07.611 --> 01:49:13.355]  It's that idea of you can be your own entrepreneur, you can be your own, make your own name, right?
[01:49:14.156 --> 01:49:15.117]  Come up the hard way.
[01:49:15.877 --> 01:49:19.140]  And that can't exist in the new system that we're going into.
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:23.603]  And so just the symbol, the image of Trump himself is a problem for the global elite.
[01:49:23.643 --> 01:49:27.085]  And that was why he had to be so demonized and so attacked.
[01:49:27.225 --> 01:49:29.387]  And I don't think they would have done that if he wasn't.
[01:49:29.847 --> 01:49:34.410]  You know, in some sense, anti-establishment, anti-system, as we see it.
[01:49:34.570 --> 01:49:42.275]  So, I would say that what we're in for is, again, that great reset model of bringing in that hot tyranny that you've talked about for so long.
[01:49:42.595 --> 01:49:48.198]  I remember that it was a declassified Army document from about ten years ago, nine years ago, that you covered.
[01:49:48.598 --> 01:49:49.359]  Re-education camps.
[01:49:49.379 --> 01:49:50.620]  Yeah, re-education camps.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.420]  And then Hillary comes out.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.361]  And people couldn't believe it.
[01:49:52.401 --> 01:49:53.601]  The Army said, no, that's real.
[01:49:54.122 --> 01:49:56.143]  Obama had them preparing to put us in camps.
[01:49:56.343 --> 01:49:58.145]  And now it's on the news!
[01:49:58.225 --> 01:50:02.129]  And at that time, the discussion was an engineered civil war.
[01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:13.321]  I remember you covered it endlessly, talking about they're going to engineer a civil war, and they have to do that to divide the countries, because that's the color revolution model where they've done in so many other countries, is to divide and split it down the middle.
[01:50:13.681 --> 01:50:17.044]  Even after the world wars, they would split the countries in the half, East Germany, West Germany.
[01:50:17.825 --> 01:50:18.086]  I don't
[01:50:34.146 --> 01:50:41.550]  What did Bannon use the phrase, like the anomaly or a chaos or something like that, which was to sort of throw a wrench in the system.
[01:50:41.610 --> 01:50:49.373]  And then now the system has the ability to step in and say, oh, by the way, Trump didn't cause these problems, but they blame any problem on Trump.
[01:50:49.433 --> 01:50:52.815]  Now they can step in and say, oh, we're going to fix all those problems that Trump caused.
[01:50:53.215 --> 01:50:53.876]  And it wasn't Trump.
[01:50:54.076 --> 01:50:55.096]  What did the WikiLeaks say?
[01:50:55.176 --> 01:50:55.336]  Right.
[01:50:55.436 --> 01:51:00.619]  All those WikiLeaks email pointed out that it was the Democratic Party working in concert with the mass media.
[01:51:00.779 --> 01:51:00.979]  Right.
[01:51:01.599 --> 01:51:08.749]  Oh, and what do you make of this new thing where they come out of Time Magazine and this secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election.
[01:51:08.989 --> 01:51:10.651]  They admit a shadow cabal runs it.
[01:51:10.671 --> 01:51:11.613]  We basically stole it.
[01:51:11.893 --> 01:51:13.195]  We suppressed Trump supporters.
[01:51:13.215 --> 01:51:14.116]  We suppressed their speech.
[01:51:14.577 --> 01:51:18.922]  Why would they put out a 25-page article, which is pretty much accurate, bragging about their criminal activity?
[01:51:19.548 --> 01:51:28.035]  Every time we have this situation where you gaslight, you throw it in the person's face, we were told for months, if you question anything, then you are creating a conspiracy theory.
[01:51:28.055 --> 01:51:29.256]  And there's no shadow group.
[01:51:29.316 --> 01:51:29.776]  That doesn't exist.
[01:51:29.796 --> 01:51:31.197]  There's no collusion to manipulate.
[01:51:31.337 --> 01:51:33.299]  Even though the New York Times says there was a shadow.
[01:51:33.519 --> 01:51:34.500]  Thank God for the deep state.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:35.720]  But it doesn't exist.
[01:51:36.001 --> 01:51:36.741]  Oh, that's a headline.
[01:51:36.801 --> 01:51:37.742]  Thank God for the deep state.
[01:51:37.762 --> 01:51:38.302]  Exactly right.
[01:51:38.343 --> 01:51:39.063]  New York Times, right?
[01:51:39.363 --> 01:51:43.346]  So, I mean, they're amazing because they constantly engage in that double think.
[01:51:43.807 --> 01:51:49.051]  On the way here, we were actually listening to 1984 on audio because it had been 10 years since I looked at it or read it.
[01:51:49.651 --> 01:51:54.673]  And literally within the first few chapters, you have the introduction of Doublethink.
[01:51:54.693 --> 01:51:55.933]  That's what they do on a daily basis.
[01:51:55.993 --> 01:52:00.815]  And why does O'Brien give him the Emanuel Goldstein Manual of Rebellion?
[01:52:00.875 --> 01:52:02.955]  And later O'Brien goes, I helped co-write this.
[01:52:04.076 --> 01:52:08.237]  And he goes, but none of us completely do it because we all hate each other and kill each other in this priesthood of power.
[01:52:08.537 --> 01:52:11.638]  But we just wanted to hurt innocent people and wanted to steal your dreams.
[01:52:12.018 --> 01:52:13.579]  And Winston's like, I would have submitted to you.
[01:52:13.599 --> 01:52:14.499]  He goes, we just want to kill you.
[01:52:15.512 --> 01:52:15.612]  He's
[01:52:32.459 --> 01:52:34.780]  It's O'Brien that was leading that rebellion.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:35.840]  The rebellion was fake, right?
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:43.023]  Emanuel Goldstein, this false, you know, anti-system person, was just a cut-out construct that was essentially O'Brien's philosophy himself.
[01:52:43.103 --> 01:52:44.204]  He was controlling that, right?
[01:52:44.484 --> 01:52:45.204]  Controlled opposition.
[01:52:45.264 --> 01:52:53.187]  Essentially, QAnon, I think, was there to step on the train of what WikiLeaks had legitimately released, right?
[01:52:53.207 --> 01:52:55.108]  Which was real scandal, real problems.
[01:52:55.128 --> 01:52:56.208]  And to turn it into a joke.
[01:52:56.228 --> 01:52:57.869]  To turn it into the nonsense, exactly.
[01:52:58.249 --> 01:53:00.873]  So Q was the answer not to InfoWars, I agree with you.
[01:53:01.153 --> 01:53:02.415]  It was the answer to Julian Assange.
[01:53:03.076 --> 01:53:04.017]  And to any whistleblowers.
[01:53:04.557 --> 01:53:05.098]  Any, yeah.
[01:53:05.659 --> 01:53:06.039]  Exactly.
[01:53:07.722 --> 01:53:12.368]  Yeah, so the real guy's locked up for 8 years in solitary confinement, but then the other one's just like this cartoon thing.
[01:53:13.646 --> 01:53:15.887]  Well, there's Wikileaks, there's InfoWars, there's a lot.
[01:53:15.927 --> 01:53:17.747]  I'm not trying to... No, no, no, no, no.
[01:53:17.827 --> 01:53:21.569]  I agree with you that Q was the answer more than anything.
[01:53:21.889 --> 01:53:23.770]  How do we deal with real secret stuff coming out?
[01:53:24.010 --> 01:53:26.351]  We create fake secret stuff and flood this info.
[01:53:26.371 --> 01:53:28.791]  So it was directly a response to Assange.
[01:53:30.632 --> 01:53:31.953]  And PR firms, right?
[01:53:32.013 --> 01:53:33.354]  So you can hire PR firms.
[01:53:33.374 --> 01:53:36.255]  If you have a thing that's coming out, a leak, right?
[01:53:36.295 --> 01:53:37.616]  Remember that movie Wag the Dog?
[01:53:37.836 --> 01:53:38.257]  Yes.
[01:53:38.597 --> 01:53:40.378]  There's this scandal coming out.
[01:53:40.398 --> 01:53:43.280]  Which came out a year before they actually did the very same thing in the same country.
[01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:45.121]  There's a scandal coming out about the president.
[01:53:45.181 --> 01:53:46.702]  And the guy wants to brag so they kill him.
[01:53:47.150 --> 01:53:50.191]  Yeah, and they release fake stories, right?
[01:53:50.291 --> 01:53:54.631]  And the fake stories, because they know the real information is going to come out, so what do we do?
[01:53:54.651 --> 01:53:55.792]  Well, let's make up a fake story.
[01:53:55.812 --> 01:53:59.932]  So instead of killing the guy, like in Wag the Dog, they allow them to put out a limited deal now.
[01:53:59.972 --> 01:54:01.113]  Yeah, limited hangout, yeah.
[01:54:01.493 --> 01:54:03.933]  Because they also want to reward people that took part of it.
[01:54:04.153 --> 01:54:06.333]  That's a good point, yeah.
[01:54:06.714 --> 01:54:09.294]  Brian Williams, you were talking about this yesterday, you actually get promoted.
[01:54:09.874 --> 01:54:11.314]  The more you lie, the more you get promoted.
[01:54:11.654 --> 01:54:12.014]  Exactly.
[01:54:12.115 --> 01:54:14.235]  Oh yeah, like, they all claim they were in combat.
[01:54:15.035 --> 01:54:15.776]  And then none of them weren't.
[01:54:16.016 --> 01:54:16.556]  And it's okay.
[01:54:16.576 --> 01:54:20.279]  It's like, well, you're now the fact checker because you're... What was Hillary's answer?
[01:54:20.299 --> 01:54:23.081]  We were there and we were being fired at by snipers.
[01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:24.922]  And then she's like, well, maybe that didn't happen.
[01:54:25.162 --> 01:54:26.083]  So it's totally made up.
[01:54:26.123 --> 01:54:28.165]  Well, the reason I brought it back up is Biden just did it.
[01:54:28.645 --> 01:54:29.786]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:30.626 --> 01:54:31.307]  Combat, yeah.
[01:54:31.387 --> 01:54:36.591]  I mean, I've been shot at too, but I was in Dallas when I was 14 buying beer from a crack house.
[01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:40.853]  I mean, anyway, sorry, keep going.
[01:54:40.873 --> 01:54:41.354]  No, that's okay.
[01:54:41.454 --> 01:54:44.956]  I was snorting a line of pumpkin popsum in there, by the way.
[01:54:44.996 --> 01:54:45.757]  You like pumpkin popsum?
[01:54:45.777 --> 01:54:45.997]  I love it.
[01:54:46.077 --> 01:54:47.618]  It's my favorite.
[01:54:47.999 --> 01:54:49.460]  People said, Jones broke character.
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:51.381]  No, I just spouted off this weird-ass thing.
[01:54:52.082 --> 01:54:52.963]  I was already pissed.
[01:54:53.363 --> 01:54:55.504]  Then I said something so stupid, I laughed at my own joke.
[01:54:55.545 --> 01:54:57.186]  They go, look, he broke character.
[01:54:57.226 --> 01:54:57.866]  It's Bill Hicks.
[01:55:00.008 --> 01:55:02.950]  No, I mean, what made me go crazy, he goes, oh, we don't even need Trump.
[01:55:03.551 --> 01:55:04.411]  Q's bigger than Trump.
[01:55:04.732 --> 01:55:07.894]  So finally, when it was all BS, he just goes, oh, forget Trump.
[01:55:07.954 --> 01:55:08.755]  I knew that was the next thing.
[01:55:09.633 --> 01:55:10.654]  Yeah, it's magical thinking.
[01:55:10.674 --> 01:55:12.035]  I think you made that point too.
[01:55:12.095 --> 01:55:16.758]  Magical thinking where we can just sort of invent all these connections and we'll make it all work.
[01:55:16.818 --> 01:55:24.523]  And when there's any real event like the Italian government actually undergoing corruption and collapsing, then suddenly that's part, everything's part of, oh, we're arresting everybody.
[01:55:24.763 --> 01:55:25.703]  Who's going to arrest the Pope?
[01:55:25.723 --> 01:55:26.504]  That's kind of ridiculous.
[01:55:26.924 --> 01:55:27.685]  Hey, let's go back.
[01:55:27.925 --> 01:55:28.945]  Put me and Bill Hicks up there.
[01:55:29.746 --> 01:55:31.267]  By the way, Hicks is Welsh.
[01:55:31.907 --> 01:55:33.829]  So we probably have a common ancestor.
[01:55:33.909 --> 01:55:36.490]  And he actually is from, I think Arkansas originally, lived in Texas.
[01:55:37.631 --> 01:55:38.592]  And the same guy that like,
[01:55:39.432 --> 01:55:39.932]  We're good to go.
[01:55:59.793 --> 01:56:01.535]  Well, don't we have to look at the earlobes to see?
[01:56:01.655 --> 01:56:03.176]  Like, are the earlobes attached or not?
[01:56:03.697 --> 01:56:07.060]  What's really insulting is they're like, look, Jones is really 69 years old.
[01:56:07.501 --> 01:56:10.183]  Like, I put a few miles on there, folks, but I really am who I say I am.
[01:56:11.104 --> 01:56:12.426]  Didn't you interview Bill Hicks one time?
[01:56:12.866 --> 01:56:13.247]  I did not.
[01:56:13.927 --> 01:56:14.127]  Okay.
[01:56:14.207 --> 01:56:16.089]  Well, there was a documentary, right?
[01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:18.292]  Waco to, uh, something to Waco.
[01:56:19.731 --> 01:56:21.393]  Uh, he was out at Waco.
[01:56:21.694 --> 01:56:22.134]  Okay.
[01:56:22.174 --> 01:56:22.815]  When it happened.
[01:56:23.235 --> 01:56:24.597]  And he was interviewed for that, yeah.
[01:56:25.037 --> 01:56:32.966]  Yeah, I was right out of high school when Waco happened, so I had not, uh, he was dead of cancer before I ran into Kevin Booth.
[01:56:33.874 --> 01:56:36.675]  And then Kevin Booth would invite me over to his house with his wife, Trey.
[01:56:37.415 --> 01:56:39.015]  And they were great cooks.
[01:56:39.035 --> 01:56:39.715]  They live in L.A.
[01:56:39.755 --> 01:56:39.936]  now.
[01:56:40.496 --> 01:56:42.576]  And he made Ninja Bachelor Party.
[01:56:42.616 --> 01:56:43.616]  He was in those movies with her.
[01:56:43.937 --> 01:56:49.798]  So the fact that I, like, knew a guy that knew Bill Hicks, and the fact that my face looks a little bit like him, I mean, I'm not Bill Hicks.
[01:56:50.398 --> 01:56:53.199]  But we've never seen you in the same room.
[01:56:53.259 --> 01:56:56.020]  All I know is people literally went back to my old high school.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.320]  They met people that knew me.
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:56:59.080]  People are like, no, I am who I say I am.
[01:57:02.284 --> 01:57:06.725]  Well, I remember watching his stand-up back in the 90s, and you were not that old.
[01:57:07.525 --> 01:57:08.366]  So that wouldn't work.
[01:57:08.566 --> 01:57:09.266]  No, that's not me.
[01:57:09.426 --> 01:57:10.286]  I was in high school.
[01:57:10.586 --> 01:57:10.766]  Yeah.
[01:57:11.667 --> 01:57:14.267]  I mean, and he was, you know, using a lot of drugs.
[01:57:15.268 --> 01:57:16.328]  So, I'm nothing against that.
[01:57:16.368 --> 01:57:17.408]  I'm just saying that's what was going on.
[01:57:17.908 --> 01:57:18.948]  Alright, let's shift gears out of that.
[01:57:18.969 --> 01:57:20.689]  This gigantic report's coming up.
[01:57:21.049 --> 01:57:22.129]  Then J. Dyer takes over.
[01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:23.750]  This is one of the most important reports ever coming up.
[01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:25.890]  In-game now.
[01:57:26.050 --> 01:57:27.791]  Globalist purge is imminent.
[01:57:28.677 --> 01:57:31.419]  The video's going live at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[01:57:31.439 --> 01:57:32.400]  We're going to premiere it.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.663]  I worked on it the last couple days with the great Greg Reese.
[01:57:36.103 --> 01:57:37.724]  Here in just a moment, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:57:37.744 --> 01:57:42.648]  We've got the great Jay Dyer with us from jaysanalysis.com hosting the next hour.
[01:57:42.668 --> 01:57:47.692]  We're going to this report here in just a few minutes, but you were mentioning to me, did you see that halftime show?
[01:57:48.693 --> 01:57:51.797]  I don't normally watch Super Bowl because I knew Tom Brady wouldn't be wearing a mask.
[01:57:52.197 --> 01:57:52.658]  I like him.
[01:57:52.678 --> 01:57:53.139]  I watched it.
[01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.321]  They're all wearing skull masks.
[01:57:55.682 --> 01:57:56.563]  They're subhuman.
[01:57:56.603 --> 01:58:00.367]  But the one guy has speech and they all, like puppets, do what he says.
[01:58:00.687 --> 01:58:01.749]  This was very sick.
[01:58:02.169 --> 01:58:05.914]  At a subconscious level, it means you are robots in a fascist event.
[01:58:05.994 --> 01:58:06.855]  You are skeletons.
[01:58:06.895 --> 01:58:07.475]  You are dead.
[01:58:07.495 --> 01:58:08.517]  I control you.
[01:58:08.937 --> 01:58:09.498]  Exactly.
[01:58:09.818 --> 01:58:12.380]  A lot of things going on here, symbolically speaking.
[01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:16.663]  It began with this choir of robots, drones, right?
[01:58:16.683 --> 01:58:25.190]  So everybody's up in the choir with the weekend guy there singing, and they're all just sort of doing what they're like, you know, puppets, like they're on a marionette, right?
[01:58:25.531 --> 01:58:26.071]  Controlled.
[01:58:26.371 --> 01:58:30.415]  And then we flash over to them as out there walking in sync.
[01:58:32.236 --> 01:58:35.140]  They've got what looks like surgical masks, which I thought was really creepy.
[01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:40.526]  So I wondered if maybe next year we're going to go past wearing masks, two masks, three masks.
[01:58:41.087 --> 01:58:42.949]  Now you have to cover your whole face with a surgical mask.
[01:58:43.170 --> 01:58:45.072]  Your masks are going to be wearing masks, right?
[01:58:45.152 --> 01:58:46.093]  Meta masks, basically.
[01:58:46.113 --> 01:58:49.597]  And this red-eyed creature lowers down like the Olympics of 2012.
[01:58:49.657 --> 01:58:49.978]  Exactly.
[01:58:49.998 --> 01:58:50.539]  The Grim Reaper.
[01:58:51.365 --> 01:59:00.207]  Yeah, I had in my notes, actually, I was going to mention that 2012 Olympics, which was all about the octopus of the global elite system on top of the British flag, right?
[01:59:00.227 --> 01:59:02.367]  The old British Empire and the octopus controlling everything.
[01:59:02.907 --> 01:59:05.508]  And look, it's the medical workers are only allowed at the Super Bowl.
[01:59:05.888 --> 01:59:07.048]  Now these are medical workers.
[01:59:07.088 --> 01:59:08.029]  They're the priesthood.
[01:59:08.429 --> 01:59:09.389]  They're going to do it all.
[01:59:09.669 --> 01:59:10.549]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[01:59:10.749 --> 01:59:15.730]  Yeah, here comes the messiah out of this, you know, the lit up messiah.
[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:17.191]  He comes toddling out.
[01:59:17.371 --> 01:59:17.631]  Right.
[01:59:17.971 --> 01:59:18.891]  The essential twerkers.
[01:59:19.921 --> 01:59:20.121]  Right.
[01:59:20.762 --> 01:59:23.044]  So here comes the messianic.
[01:59:23.064 --> 01:59:24.266]  And he doesn't have to wear the mask.
[01:59:24.406 --> 01:59:24.966]  No, of course not.
[01:59:24.986 --> 01:59:27.329]  But by the way, nobody criticized him for not wearing a mask.
[01:59:27.869 --> 01:59:30.953]  And then when they're all marching in sync, you know, it's like red and black.
[01:59:30.993 --> 01:59:34.336]  You've got this sort of communist slash satanic outlook, right?
[01:59:34.376 --> 01:59:35.537]  Like the color scheme.
[01:59:35.617 --> 01:59:36.398]  And very fascist.
[01:59:36.598 --> 01:59:37.219]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:37.239 --> 01:59:38.140]  It's all very authoritarian.
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:38.860]  Remember the wall?
[01:59:41.441 --> 01:59:45.142]  In Pink Floyd's The Wall, there's the hammers that are walking.
[01:59:45.162 --> 01:59:45.502]  Stay there!
[01:59:45.522 --> 01:59:48.323]  We're going to go to this special report that just went live.
[01:59:48.903 --> 01:59:50.343]  The endgame is now.
[01:59:50.763 --> 01:59:52.264]  This is so important to get out.
[01:59:52.584 --> 01:59:54.844]  This is their master plan to come after everybody.
[01:59:55.264 --> 01:59:57.045]  The proof of their plan to put us in FEMA camps.
[01:59:57.645 --> 02:00:04.514]  This is extremely powerful, but the only way it gets past the fandom zone, with all of us only seeing it, is you sharing it.
[02:00:04.554 --> 02:00:09.321]  Share it now via Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, your instant message, your email.
[02:00:09.401 --> 02:00:09.981]  Do it now.
[02:00:10.041 --> 02:00:10.602]  Word of mouth.
[02:00:10.642 --> 02:00:10.963]  Share it.
[02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:19.281]  During his inauguration speech, Joe Biden spoke of confronting and defeating domestic terrorism.
[02:00:19.741 --> 02:00:28.373]  A rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.
[02:00:31.286 --> 02:00:39.930]  John Brennan, former director of the CIA, went on MSNBC that evening and labeled libertarians as domestic terrorists.
[02:00:40.110 --> 02:00:46.433]  I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team who have been nominated or have been appointed
[02:00:47.328 --> 02:01:12.168]  ...are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we've seen overseas, where they germinate in different parts of the country, and they gain strength, and it brings together an unholy alliance, frequently, of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists, even libertarians.
[02:01:12.748 --> 02:01:21.734]  A libertarian is a supporter of a political philosophy that advocates minimal state intervention in the free market and the private lives of citizens.
[02:01:22.454 --> 02:01:24.896]  A person who advocates civil liberty.
[02:01:25.556 --> 02:01:29.339]  But now, in America, a libertarian is a terrorist.
[02:01:29.819 --> 02:01:31.680]  A Trump supporter is a terrorist.
[02:01:32.221 --> 02:01:35.063]  A constitutional American is a terrorist.
[02:01:35.743 --> 02:01:39.426]  Make no mistake, tyranny has arrived in America.
[02:01:40.106 --> 02:01:42.728]  And history tells us what comes next.
[02:01:43.369 --> 02:01:46.691]  The tyrants will now go after all political dissidents.
[02:01:47.472 --> 02:01:50.975]  There was a time when the liberal media supported democracy and freedom.
[02:01:51.455 --> 02:01:58.220]  During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, the American media seemed to recognize the dangers of the CCP.
[02:01:59.461 --> 02:02:08.989]  But now, along with Hollywood and major sports, the news media is all owned by globalist multinational corporations and the CCP.
[02:02:09.570 --> 02:02:19.518]  The pop culture media machine has made all of this possible, and it is now busy preparing their brainwashed flock for mass arrests and re-education camps.
[02:02:20.419 --> 02:02:30.294]  A Bernie Sanders staffer and the principal counsel for PBS were separately caught on camera calling for rounding up Trump supporters and putting them in re-education camps.
[02:02:30.955 --> 02:02:33.158]  But that was before Biden was in the White House.
[02:02:33.699 --> 02:02:35.622]  Now it's all out in the open.
[02:02:36.303 --> 02:02:51.379]  Popular Morning Television co-host Megan McCain, daughter of John McCain, who funded ISIS and Al-Qaeda in the ongoing war on terror debacle, says that American patriots need to be treated the same as Al-Qaeda terrorists.
[02:02:51.679 --> 02:02:54.702]  I'm not against sending these people to Gitmo, and that may sound extreme.
[02:02:54.983 --> 02:02:57.045]  These are domestic terrorists who attacked our own republic.
[02:02:57.085 --> 02:02:58.807]  They should be treated the same way we treat Al-Qaeda.
[02:02:59.307 --> 02:03:05.731]  MSNBC's Nicole Wallace suggests the possibility of killing Americans with drone strikes.
[02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:18.998]  Attacking terrorism at its root, of going after and killing, and in the case of Omar al-Awlaki, an American, a Yemeni American, with a drone strike for the crime of inciting violence, inciting terrorism.
[02:03:19.398 --> 02:03:28.745]  Regional Director of California Democrats unapologetically suggests rounding up 75 million Americans and putting them in concentration camps.
[02:03:29.465 --> 02:03:37.491]  Americans are now being psychologically prepared for the rounding up, brainwashing, torture, and mass murder of American patriots.
[02:03:37.771 --> 02:03:42.033]  It is critical that the FBI does launch the largest manhunt in U.S.
[02:03:42.073 --> 02:03:51.538]  history, drag all of these people into prison, and if they're inside the Capitol for a full 20 years for committing sedition against the United States of America.
[02:03:51.558 --> 02:03:59.082]  The question is how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump?
[02:03:59.563 --> 02:04:03.845]  Almost all white, almost all Republicans who somehow
[02:04:06.567 --> 02:04:10.411]  Once we educate them, we coach them on how to interact.
[02:04:10.711 --> 02:04:18.618]  We probably need to double, triple, quadruple or increase funding for these de-radicalization programs.
[02:04:18.718 --> 02:04:27.886]  Biden's press secretary announces how leftist NGOs will be involved in performing threat assessments on domestic terrorists.
[02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:33.328]  Meaning, if you oppose their Marxist ideology, you're a threat to them.
[02:04:34.068 --> 02:04:36.169]  This is all part of the leftist playbook.
[02:04:36.849 --> 02:04:40.410]  The Weather Underground was planning for this in the 1970s.
[02:04:40.630 --> 02:04:49.913]  They felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[02:04:52.424 --> 02:05:01.550]  Well, we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[02:05:02.471 --> 02:05:06.053]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[02:05:06.774 --> 02:05:08.795]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[02:05:09.896 --> 02:05:12.518]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[02:05:13.935 --> 02:05:21.762]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[02:05:22.382 --> 02:05:24.124]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[02:05:24.764 --> 02:05:26.826]  It is now undeniably here.
[02:05:28.007 --> 02:05:36.213]  HR 127 will require psychological evaluations and a public database for all gun owners.
[02:05:37.034 --> 02:05:42.858]  With the entire nation divided into patriots and obedient cowards, they know who you are.
[02:05:43.578 --> 02:05:47.000]  And they know they have the support of the brainwashed masses.
[02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:51.963]  They have been preparing the entire world population with COVID-19.
[02:05:53.664 --> 02:06:02.395]  Almost a year ago, the WHO's Dr. Ryan announced that they will be entering people's homes and removing family members.
[02:06:02.675 --> 02:06:12.147]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[02:06:12.307 --> 02:06:15.290]  The leftists in power are ready to break our will.
[02:06:15.970 --> 02:06:17.171]  They will cut off the power.
[02:06:17.712 --> 02:06:19.253]  They will shut down our businesses.
[02:06:19.814 --> 02:06:22.596]  They will destroy anyone who stands in their way.
[02:06:23.457 --> 02:06:32.885]  And they are now vetting the military to weed out any patriots who might have a problem with the unlawful mass arrests of American citizens.
[02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:43.500]  And you can be sure that at least one major false flag, if not several, is already being planned to act as the catalyst for all of this.
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:51.505]  Another Oklahoma City bombing to blame on libertarian terrorists and American constitutionalists.
[02:06:52.385 --> 02:06:54.747]  The new war on domestic terror is beginning.
[02:06:55.287 --> 02:06:56.968]  Don't expect it to go slowly.
[02:06:57.649 --> 02:07:04.934]  If you are not making decisions and actions today as if your very life depends on it, then you are still asleep in the matrix.
[02:07:05.554 --> 02:07:07.235]  Wake up before it's too late.
[02:07:07.816 --> 02:07:09.477]  That day is coming fast.
[02:07:10.137 --> 02:07:12.319]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[02:07:13.447 --> 02:07:17.529]  Alright, that is the most important work in my 27 years we've ever done.
[02:07:18.929 --> 02:07:19.570]  This is it.
[02:07:19.670 --> 02:07:20.970]  This is what's about to happen.
[02:07:22.071 --> 02:07:23.271]  It needs 50 million views.
[02:07:23.411 --> 02:07:24.011]  Endgame now.
[02:07:24.051 --> 02:07:24.912]  Global Purge imminent.
[02:07:25.352 --> 02:07:26.172]  Ban.video.
[02:07:26.532 --> 02:07:26.933]  Share it.
[02:07:27.153 --> 02:07:27.693]  Tell everybody.
[02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:28.913]  Tell 100 people today.
[02:07:28.953 --> 02:07:29.874]  Tell a little to 100 people.
[02:07:30.294 --> 02:07:30.894]  Expose it.
[02:07:30.914 --> 02:07:31.675]  We can stop it.
[02:07:31.695 --> 02:07:33.295]  But only if you take action!
[02:07:33.735 --> 02:07:34.816]  It's now up to you.
[02:07:35.136 --> 02:07:36.176]  It's in your hands.
[02:07:37.077 --> 02:07:39.438]  Do not submit to these murderers!
[02:07:41.482 --> 02:07:47.351]  Man, I gotta tell you, that seven-minute report by Greg Reese that he and I worked on is so critical.
[02:07:47.492 --> 02:07:49.675]  I mean, I won't steer you wrong, folks.
[02:07:50.096 --> 02:07:51.638]  That's coming on like a freight train.
[02:07:52.483 --> 02:08:00.090]  You better send every governor, every legislature you know, every talk show you know, because let me tell you, all you people wanting a war, you're about to get one.
[02:08:00.130 --> 02:08:00.731]  I don't want one.
[02:08:01.111 --> 02:08:04.234]  Jay Dyer, you're about to take over this hour ahead of Owen Shore in the War Room.
[02:08:04.614 --> 02:08:12.502]  Hopefully you're going to go on with him and go on in the morning if you're here in town with Harrison Smith and his popular weekday morning program, American Journal.
[02:08:12.522 --> 02:08:14.484]  But what are you about to be covering here in the next hour?
[02:08:14.929 --> 02:08:22.695]  Well, I was just thinking about the report that you were talking about regarding OKC, and it reminded me of that event when that event happened.
[02:08:22.795 --> 02:08:24.316]  You know, I think you covered it at the time.
[02:08:24.336 --> 02:08:26.178]  There was a news report that came out.
[02:08:26.238 --> 02:08:32.863]  It was a local news story about the governor's, I think, brother had written a book that had... The Knights of the Secret Circle.
[02:08:32.883 --> 02:08:33.804]  The Knights of the Secret Circle.
[02:08:33.904 --> 02:08:35.425]  And it had a... With a Tom McVeigh.
[02:08:35.585 --> 02:08:37.306]  Tom McVeigh had done this terror event.
[02:08:37.326 --> 02:08:38.167]  Which is lesser magic.
[02:08:38.207 --> 02:08:39.328]  They gotta explain that to people.
[02:08:39.608 --> 02:08:40.208]  They gotta tell you.
[02:08:40.649 --> 02:08:41.569]  I didn't mean to steal your thunder.
[02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:49.935]  No, no, it's like a form of, it's similar to psychological warfare where you gaslight and you tell people ahead of time, but what it does is it sort of disarms you, right?
[02:08:50.035 --> 02:08:55.458]  It's a spell, like now that you've been told what's going to happen in the fiction, in the movies and whatever, when it happens.
[02:08:55.518 --> 02:08:57.980]  They believe it makes it go well because they already said it.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:58.380]  Right.
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.721]  Yeah, it's part of the spell, right?
[02:08:59.741 --> 02:09:00.422]  It's a dress rehearsal.
[02:09:01.042 --> 02:09:05.325]  It is, and you have people actually in psychological warfare that write on how to do that.
[02:09:05.405 --> 02:09:10.028]  Michael Aquino has a whole book on using black magic principles in psychological warfare.
[02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:11.670]  He wrote an essay, Mind War, Psy War.
[02:09:11.710 --> 02:09:12.830]  You covered that many years ago.
[02:09:13.351 --> 02:09:17.914]  And that's what you get with the fiction kind of prepping and programming us for that stuff.
[02:09:18.675 --> 02:09:23.118]  But yeah, it was so obvious too that, you know, McVeigh was a person who was sheep-dipped, right?
[02:09:23.158 --> 02:09:24.739]  He had this cover of being military.
[02:09:24.759 --> 02:09:27.721]  He was actually brought into some program, probably mind control.
[02:09:27.781 --> 02:09:30.083]  I think Dr. Jolion West had some- It was Delta Force.
[02:09:30.783 --> 02:09:31.244]  I don't know.
[02:09:50.842 --> 02:09:51.583]  Yeah, Oklahoma City.
[02:09:51.763 --> 02:09:55.307]  That was the model, I think, for what types of things we'll see in the future.
[02:09:55.347 --> 02:10:03.136]  Gladio is another model to look at for how to do these kinds of big events to, you know, paint the enemy as the people who are actually the patriots.
[02:10:04.137 --> 02:10:05.359]  So what are you going to cover in the next hour?
[02:10:06.028 --> 02:10:09.950]  I thought we'd talk a little bit about Hollywood, and then we'd talk about Treasury Hope itself, right?
[02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:15.192]  Because I haven't, on your show, talked about the master tome, Quigley himself.
[02:10:15.273 --> 02:10:16.333]  Bill Clinton's main advisor.
[02:10:16.393 --> 02:10:16.853]  Exactly.
[02:10:16.893 --> 02:10:18.734]  And kind of, because this is what we're seeing, right?
[02:10:18.754 --> 02:10:23.897]  We're seeing, if you want to know their system from their words, this is the key text right here.
[02:10:23.937 --> 02:10:24.257]  All right.
[02:10:25.357 --> 02:10:26.378]  I'm going to punch you out of here.
[02:10:26.398 --> 02:10:28.919]  I haven't had a five-year checkup.
[02:10:28.939 --> 02:10:29.899]  I haven't had a checkup in five years.
[02:10:29.919 --> 02:10:31.720]  I'm going to a doctor checkup today, and then I'm going to come back.
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:33.641]  I'll do a bunch of reports tonight, folks.
[02:10:33.701 --> 02:10:34.602]  But separately,
[02:10:35.506 --> 02:10:39.429]  We have Wintersun Vitamin D3 back in stock, a limited supply.
[02:10:39.449 --> 02:10:40.890]  We can't get the bottles and the caps.
[02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:42.852]  So we got like one third of our order.
[02:10:43.232 --> 02:10:44.373]  This is how we fund ourselves.
[02:10:44.433 --> 02:10:46.514]  It's very frustrating, but it is back in stock.
[02:10:47.135 --> 02:10:49.276]  It's great for your immune system, great for your body.
[02:10:49.296 --> 02:10:49.416]  25% off.

[02:10:51.738 --> 02:10:53.540]  It's a very high quality Vitamin B12.
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:58.563]  Also take them sublingually under the tongue or get it by itself at 50% off.
[02:10:58.944 --> 02:11:00.104]  That's how we fund ourselves.

[02:11:04.048 --> 02:11:08.112]  That's how I've got the great Greg Reese researcher that moved here from Hawaii.
[02:11:08.152 --> 02:11:09.913]  He did a great job with the report you just saw.
[02:11:09.953 --> 02:11:14.217]  That's how I have all this crew, all this infrastructure, all these things is you.
[02:11:14.337 --> 02:11:14.998]  You built this.
[02:11:15.378 --> 02:11:15.759]  You did it.
[02:11:15.799 --> 02:11:16.319]  It's amazing.
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:17.981]  So, DNA Force Plus.
[02:11:18.021 --> 02:11:18.862]  So good for your body.
[02:11:19.162 --> 02:11:22.485]  The flagship product with the CoQ10, the PQQ, and so much more.
[02:11:22.505 --> 02:11:23.646]  25% off selling out.
[02:11:25.067 --> 02:11:25.747]  We have it all.
[02:11:26.188 --> 02:11:28.729]  X2, X3, the pure iodines.

[02:11:30.690 --> 02:11:32.290]  Rainforest and much other stuff sold out.
[02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:36.532]  We have our liquid turmeric concentrate still available, about to sell out as well.
[02:11:36.972 --> 02:11:39.053]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253.
[02:11:41.893 --> 02:11:46.275]  3139.
[02:11:42.013 --> 02:11:46.275]  And we also have the new Trader Joe's t-shirt with the four countries.
[02:11:46.735 --> 02:11:50.477]  Joe Biden's publicly sold us out to China, Russia, Ukraine, Iran.
[02:11:50.897 --> 02:11:52.337]  That shirt is back in stock.
[02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:53.958]  The first batch sold out very quickly.
[02:11:53.978 --> 02:11:57.099]  Just want to thank you all for your support.
[02:11:57.159 --> 02:11:58.420]  Sign up for AutoShip.

[02:12:07.544 --> 02:12:13.370]  All right, we're going to air this short Paul Joseph Watson report, Why They Hate Tom Brady, who I love not wearing that mask.
[02:12:14.211 --> 02:12:16.233]  That's coming up for a few minutes, the next segment.
[02:12:16.293 --> 02:12:21.578]  Then Jay Dyer takes over right here in the Crow's Nest.
[02:12:21.698 --> 02:12:22.199]  We'll be back.
[02:12:22.239 --> 02:12:22.679]  Stay with us.
[02:12:23.621 --> 02:12:33.303]  As Tom Brady confirmed his status as the greatest of all time by winning a seventh Super Bowl, leftists had a collective meltdown over the fact that he wasn't wearing a mask.
[02:12:33.523 --> 02:12:37.184]  Considering everything happening in that stadium, I doubt this actually matters.
[02:12:37.464 --> 02:12:41.565]  But a dude as famous as Tom Brady should just do the right thing and wear a mask.
[02:12:41.865 --> 02:12:43.346]  I think I have to turn off this game.
[02:12:43.526 --> 02:12:44.246]  You're making me angry!
[02:12:44.927 --> 02:12:52.176]  Imagine being so pathetic that the mere sight of someone not muzzling themselves makes you shout furiously at the television.
[02:12:52.216 --> 02:12:56.761]  Kamala Harris's niece demanded to know, what's Tom doing without a dumb mask?
[02:12:56.961 --> 02:13:01.187]  Recall that lefties continually insist that wearing a mask is not political.
[02:13:01.647 --> 02:13:14.617]  While trying to make it political at every available opportunity, like this woman who blamed it on Brady's previous support for Trump, Brady was also branded racist for being victorious over a black quarterback during Black History Month.
[02:13:14.817 --> 02:13:15.517]  Yeah, really.
[02:13:15.598 --> 02:13:18.700]  Tom Brady winning during Black History Month is so racist.
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:22.523]  Ain't no way Tom Brady winning seven Super Bowls during Black History Month ain't racist.
[02:13:22.583 --> 02:13:23.664]  Really, Tom Brady?
[02:13:26.430 --> 02:13:29.451]  There were literally hundreds if not thousands of these tweets.
[02:13:29.571 --> 02:13:39.473]  This followed the publication of a USA Today op-ed last week in which Nancy-Armor expressed her fury at Brady for not apologising for his white privilege.
[02:13:39.533 --> 02:13:43.594]  The woke mob hate Brady because he's one of a rare and dying breed.
[02:13:43.694 --> 02:13:50.016]  An authentic human being who hasn't had to compromise his dignity by caving to ideological bullies
[02:13:50.276 --> 02:13:51.197]  Total compliance is mandatory!
[02:14:07.992 --> 02:14:13.636]  How dare someone in a high-profile position not amplify our divisive, demented extremist views!
[02:14:13.696 --> 02:14:15.817]  We've terrified everyone else into doing it!
[02:14:15.917 --> 02:14:23.102]  We've weaponized cancel culture to ruin people's careers if they refuse to be cowed by us, but it's just not working on Tom Brady!
[02:14:23.122 --> 02:14:29.867]  Yeah, well sit down losers, because he's got seven Super Bowls and all you've got is a bit of dopamine for your cringe-whiny tweets.
[02:14:30.107 --> 02:14:31.087]  As Dave Blount writes,
[02:14:38.653 --> 02:14:43.397]  They wouldn't mind for him to defend Trump so they could feature Brady for the two minutes hate.
[02:14:43.677 --> 02:14:51.764]  But just keeping his mouth shut on the grounds that athletes should not have to justify their political views to ideological bullies is not acceptable.
[02:14:51.904 --> 02:14:58.350]  So USA Today attacks in the most vicious way liberals can conceive of by denouncing him for being Caucasian.
[02:14:58.490 --> 02:15:01.651]  Brady also serves as a mirror to Colin Kaepernick.
[02:15:01.851 --> 02:15:06.392]  A total failure propped up by millions in corporate Nike sponsorship money.
[02:15:06.712 --> 02:15:11.434]  A company that literally lobbies against legislation to ban slave labour.
[02:15:11.594 --> 02:15:12.354]  So woke!
[02:15:12.594 --> 02:15:15.635]  Brady represents everything the system despises.
[02:15:15.935 --> 02:15:20.036]  Christian, dignified, morally upstanding, incorruptible.
[02:15:20.376 --> 02:15:22.918]  He's like holding up a cross to a vampire.
[02:15:22.978 --> 02:15:26.081]  He's a throwback, a hero, like they used to make them.
[02:15:26.201 --> 02:15:31.286]  A positive role model in a society full of manufactured fakes and inauthentic sellouts.
[02:15:31.486 --> 02:15:34.989]  So congratulations, Tom Brady, the greatest of all time.
[02:15:35.089 --> 02:15:36.310]  And sit down, haters.
[02:15:36.450 --> 02:15:43.016]  Remember, if a system and a culture as insipidly evil as ours hates you, chances are you're one of the good guys.
[02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:58.180]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:00.551]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com.
[02:16:01.701 --> 02:16:12.610]  And, you know, if you were paying attention to the Cryptosphere today, wow, what an amazing event with a lot of speculation over Elon Musk being into crypto for a long time.
[02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:13.531]  But was he actually?
[02:16:13.551 --> 02:16:14.712]  Well, it was kind of unclear.
[02:16:14.732 --> 02:16:19.075]  And then the last few weeks, if you followed this, you've noticed that he's tweeted a lot about Doge.
[02:16:19.115 --> 02:16:25.360]  He put Bitcoin in his bio on Twitter, 45 million people seeing him with that in his bio, and then
[02:16:26.181 --> 02:16:26.901]  Come on, Alex!
[02:16:55.908 --> 02:16:57.208]  And I listened, right?
[02:16:57.308 --> 02:16:59.969]  I finally got into it, and great decision.
[02:17:00.129 --> 02:17:00.589]  Great decision.
[02:17:00.649 --> 02:17:01.690]  I would recommend it.
[02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:06.811]  And I think one of the misunderstandings about Bitcoin is the idea that it doesn't exist.
[02:17:06.831 --> 02:17:09.872]  It doesn't have anything that's hard, so to speak.
[02:17:09.932 --> 02:17:14.274]  But if you think about the way that, you know, banking works, right?
[02:17:14.394 --> 02:17:15.254]  E-banking, right?
[02:17:15.274 --> 02:17:19.315]  Your money right now is already, in a sense, electronic, right?
[02:17:19.355 --> 02:17:24.417]  So you're already doing electronic banking when you're using the app for your personal bank on your phone.
[02:17:25.237 --> 02:17:29.762]  And really, Bitcoin is not a whole lot different from that, except that it's more like gold.
[02:17:29.862 --> 02:17:32.985]  It's like having a private, you know, electronic version of gold.
[02:17:33.045 --> 02:17:34.066]  It's gold 2.0.
[02:17:34.166 --> 02:17:40.372]  It's literally the hardest asset the world has ever known because it's impossible to fiat run up.
[02:17:40.973 --> 02:17:41.714]  Bitcoin.
[02:17:41.894 --> 02:17:44.978]  21 million Bitcoin is all that will ever exist.
[02:17:44.998 --> 02:17:47.181]  4 million or so have been lost.
[02:17:47.782 --> 02:17:58.375]  And so that's why people are figuring out, with the last year of inflation, with the money printing, with the corona virus stuff that we saw in the last year, right?
[02:17:59.416 --> 02:18:02.518]  The purchasing power of the dollar is down something like 10-20%, right?
[02:18:02.678 --> 02:18:08.621]  And with Biden now, we can only expect more of that level of inflation.
[02:18:08.861 --> 02:18:10.282]  And so you're going to lose even more.
[02:18:10.362 --> 02:18:17.946]  So a lot of really wealthy people, a lot of rich dudes are like, how can I protect my money from losing its value?
[02:18:18.726 --> 02:18:22.188]  If you've got billions of dollars, that's billions lost, right?
[02:18:22.208 --> 02:18:24.449]  So that's why the rich guys are into this.
[02:18:24.809 --> 02:18:36.436]  CEO Michael Saylor, for example, you know, famous in the last few months because he put billions into Bitcoin as a reserve asset, right, to store up
[02:18:37.176 --> 02:18:38.496]  We're good to go.
[02:19:01.344 --> 02:19:04.067]  Just think back to the 2008 economic crisis, right?
[02:19:04.347 --> 02:19:07.890]  Bailouts, bailouts, bailout all the banks, bailout Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, all this stuff.
[02:19:08.611 --> 02:19:11.554]  That is, that's theft, right?
[02:19:11.794 --> 02:19:16.558]  Inflation is slow motion theft from all of us, from everybody.
[02:19:17.532 --> 02:19:26.037]  And even though there is volatility in Bitcoin, that's one of the things that is intended in the long term, right, to protect against.
[02:19:26.177 --> 02:19:34.581]  So five, ten years, we'll see a lot less volatility when it reaches these higher levels, probably 65 according to Kaiser at the end of the year.
[02:19:34.922 --> 02:19:40.705]  You follow the stock to flow chart, which has been supremely accurate in the last several years, the stock to flow model.
[02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:44.355]  Shows Bitcoin at about $100,000, I think, by the end of this year.
[02:19:44.875 --> 02:19:52.179]  And then when we get the next halving, right, in 2025, around that time, where it's projected to be up in the hundreds of thousands, right?
[02:19:52.219 --> 02:19:53.620]  So, no guarantees here.
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:55.001]  I'm not a financial advisor.
[02:19:55.041 --> 02:19:59.103]  I'm just going by the last several years of research into crypto that I've done.
[02:19:59.724 --> 02:20:01.905]  And really, again, there's a lot of crypto.
[02:20:01.925 --> 02:20:03.586]  It's a lot to learn.
[02:20:03.606 --> 02:20:07.969]  I'm not trying to tell you which ones to get, but there are a lot of advantages to
[02:20:08.809 --> 02:20:10.329]  The stable Bitcoin, right?
[02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:12.390]  The name of Bitcoin, right?
[02:20:13.691 --> 02:20:17.432]  And I think it's a good bet for the next several years, especially.
[02:20:18.152 --> 02:20:21.613]  So, no surprise there, but amazing to see that.
[02:20:22.433 --> 02:20:27.655]  One thing I thought maybe we'd talk about since I'm stepping in here is where we're going and where we've come from.
[02:20:28.315 --> 02:20:32.016]  You followed a lot of the talks that I've done or the fourth hours that I've hosted.
[02:20:32.036 --> 02:20:34.737]  You know, we've talked a lot about the writings of the elite themselves.
[02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:52.564]  I was just at a conference here in Texas this weekend, philosophy conference, and people were saying, I've seen you on Alex's show, I've seen you do these talks, I've seen some of this stuff, but I can't understand why they would talk about what they do openly.
[02:20:53.544 --> 02:20:55.245]  Why would they put this in their books?
[02:20:55.905 --> 02:21:01.806]  This seems to be the common refrain from people as to why they can't believe that this is going on.
[02:21:01.926 --> 02:21:03.847]  I just can't believe that they would put it in a book.
[02:21:05.435 --> 02:21:08.339]  So the question isn't really, is there evidence and proof?
[02:21:08.860 --> 02:21:12.786]  It's people's inability to accept that there's evidence and proof, right?
[02:21:13.806 --> 02:21:22.192]  Now, a lot of the people at this conference, for example, it was a religiously focused conference, were a couple years ago very skeptical, right?
[02:21:22.252 --> 02:21:23.753]  They knew about the stuff I talked about.
[02:21:23.793 --> 02:21:25.254]  They said, well, this is kind of out there.
[02:21:25.274 --> 02:21:25.934]  This is crazy.
[02:21:26.375 --> 02:21:27.295]  Now they know it's real.
[02:21:27.816 --> 02:21:31.498]  And I had people coming up to me saying, man, I saw Klaus.
[02:21:32.038 --> 02:21:32.879]  I saw what he said.
[02:21:32.899 --> 02:21:38.723]  So I guess you were right, but I still can't understand how it is they would write it in their book.
[02:21:38.743 --> 02:21:39.984]  So that's what I want to look at here.
[02:21:41.084 --> 02:21:52.087]  When we come back from this break, we're going to look at Tragedy and Hope, Professor Dr. Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor, archivist of the CFR, historian of the CFR.
[02:21:52.107 --> 02:21:54.168]  We're going to look at his overview.
[02:21:54.188 --> 02:22:02.350]  We're going to overview this massive 1,200-1,300-page book and talk about why this book is so important and how it tells us everything that's going on.
[02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:05.832]  I'm Jay Dyer, the guest host of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:06.332 --> 02:22:07.614]  We'll be back in just a moment.
[02:22:07.654 --> 02:22:08.234]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:22:08.554 --> 02:22:08.955]  All right.
[02:22:09.455 --> 02:22:11.637]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:11.737 --> 02:22:13.779]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:22:14.639 --> 02:22:22.046]  And wow, it's been a wild, fast-paced thing going down here in the InfoWars studios.
[02:22:23.496 --> 02:22:28.421]  I wanted to talk about Tragedy and Hope because, you know, we've covered a lot of the global elite techs.
[02:22:29.102 --> 02:22:31.945]  Kind of like, in the sense that I'm doing your homework for you, right?
[02:22:31.965 --> 02:22:33.846]  Somebody was asking me this weekend, what do you do?
[02:22:33.887 --> 02:22:35.348]  And I was like, I do people's homework.
[02:22:35.368 --> 02:22:36.409]  They're like, what?
[02:22:37.350 --> 02:22:38.791]  Yes, you know.
[02:22:39.991 --> 02:22:44.014]  There's a test and I'm the nerd that's going to do your homework for you.
[02:22:44.094 --> 02:22:46.616]  So let me it's multiple choice.
[02:22:46.656 --> 02:22:47.657]  So you better get the right answer.
[02:22:47.697 --> 02:22:47.877]  Right?
[02:22:48.277 --> 02:22:54.662]  So let's talk about this big fat book that probably nobody's ever going to read because it's really boring.
[02:22:54.922 --> 02:22:55.783]  It's not a fun read.
[02:22:55.803 --> 02:23:00.606]  I remember I fell asleep a lot of time when I was reading this book like it fell over in my lap.
[02:23:01.827 --> 02:23:02.808]  So it's a great sleep aid.
[02:23:03.028 --> 02:23:04.589]  But what is?
[02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:22.544]  This book is about the tragedy of the 20th century, which is the two world wars, and the third world war being the Cold War, and the hope, which is the idea of spreading liberal democracy to the rest of the world, whether you want it or not.
[02:23:23.505 --> 02:23:25.806]  You will be liberal or we will blow you up, right?
[02:23:26.327 --> 02:23:27.148]  In the sense of
[02:23:28.088 --> 02:23:30.009]  The worst sense of the word, right?
[02:23:30.049 --> 02:23:32.170]  Leftism is ultimately what we get with this.
[02:23:32.650 --> 02:23:49.797]  And so he begins the book by talking about the Enlightenment period, the world order that was created out of the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and how the process and logic of revolution necessitated that there would be an end to anything traditional.
[02:23:51.077 --> 02:23:54.559]  So you get the end of the Russian Empire,
[02:23:55.370 --> 02:24:05.275]  And you get the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and these are the two, quote, traditional powers from the vantage point of the last 2,000 years of, you know, Christendom, Christianity.
[02:24:05.795 --> 02:24:08.937]  From the global elite perspective, that needs to go away.
[02:24:09.457 --> 02:24:21.903]  And so, more or less, Quigley says, and I'm not exaggerating, but he says that the two world wars are engineered by the international banking power to get rid of these two powers.
[02:24:22.961 --> 02:24:24.702]  By the way, that's not unique to Quigley.
[02:24:24.762 --> 02:24:26.643]  A lot of people have that analysis, right?
[02:24:27.044 --> 02:24:42.394]  Friedman at Stratfor, he has a famous analysis where he talks about the fact that that was really what the 20th century was about, was getting rid of the two things that stood in the way to the Anglo-American establishment's expansion, basically, of the liberal imperium to the rest of the world.
[02:24:43.214 --> 02:24:45.695]  And that liberal imperium doesn't mean classical liberalism.
[02:24:46.336 --> 02:24:56.841]  In fact, at the beginning of the book there's a section where Quigley talks about how we moved away from classical liberalism and into what he calls financial capitalism and monopoly capitalism, right?
[02:24:57.422 --> 02:25:07.247]  And so what that means is just that we got away from this idea of freedom and we moved into something that's more extreme where ultimately it ends in technocracy.
[02:25:08.274 --> 02:25:20.549]  And the way that we got to technocracy, according to Quigley, was not just the World Wars themselves and the chaos and the death, the destruction and reconstruction of the nations, but rather the Depression.
[02:25:21.430 --> 02:25:24.874]  The Depression played a key role in economic integration.
[02:25:26.088 --> 02:25:31.072]  As well as not just getting America into massive debt that was engineered, right?
[02:25:31.092 --> 02:25:39.499]  This boom-bust-bubble-pop cycle, Quigley says, is a game that the banking, that the power elite actually know how to engineer.
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:47.585]  So it's not all this just organic thing, well, we just happen to be in the market of, you know, boom-cycle the market, oh, it just happens to bust.
[02:25:48.246 --> 02:25:51.108]  He actually describes in this chapter an amazing pattern
[02:25:52.509 --> 02:26:04.195]  Of almost like decades of the elite pushing for centralization of wealth, centralization in a private Federal Reserve.
[02:26:05.208 --> 02:26:11.091]  And then a kind of move away from that to privatization and free markets.
[02:26:11.131 --> 02:26:21.296]  And they'll do this back and forth step so that what they're actually doing is taking an entire decade's worth of people's energy, and that's what money represents, right?
[02:26:21.916 --> 02:26:24.978]  It's a representation of human energy and the storage of energy.
[02:26:25.618 --> 02:26:28.359]  Right, and just siphoning that off to the banking elite.
[02:26:28.379 --> 02:26:29.479]  That's literally what he says, right?
[02:26:29.499 --> 02:26:33.219]  So you might have a period under FDR where it's like promotion of communism.
[02:26:33.739 --> 02:26:36.040]  Oh, the state's gonna give you, you know, public works jobs.
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:37.160]  Oh, we're gonna have TVA.
[02:26:37.180 --> 02:26:38.340]  Oh, we're gonna have Manhattan Project.
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:39.701]  Oh, it's gonna put everybody to work, right?
[02:26:40.021 --> 02:26:41.541]  A chicken in every pot, this kind of a thing.
[02:26:41.881 --> 02:26:48.482]  Which is a scam, because what's happening is that, as he admits, the entire FDR period was actually just getting the U.S.
[02:26:48.582 --> 02:26:50.423]  further in debt to the banking elite.
[02:26:51.243 --> 02:26:52.763]  So it wasn't actually paying anything off.
[02:26:53.595 --> 02:26:58.721]  The money was just actually going to the banking elite that we already owed in debt.
[02:26:59.402 --> 02:27:00.463]  So debt is the key.
[02:27:00.843 --> 02:27:04.468]  Debt slavery is the key to the entire system, not just the U.S.
[02:27:04.508 --> 02:27:07.271]  and the Great Depression, but the entire world banking system.
[02:27:07.972 --> 02:27:11.996]  And when you do that, when you run up this gigantic fiat system,
[02:27:12.717 --> 02:27:17.280]  To move it away from the gold center, that's why the 70's Shock Doctrine was so important.
[02:27:17.320 --> 02:27:24.284]  Moving away from any kind of standard allowed there to be these gigantic, massive debt bubbles, which are by design.
[02:27:24.884 --> 02:27:31.789]  And that's the key point that Quigley admits, even though he's not an economist, he's admitting this about the way that the elite worked the system.
[02:27:32.409 --> 02:27:36.253]  And again, you know, the US economy is obviously the biggest, so it's not just the US economy.
[02:27:36.293 --> 02:27:45.941]  But now I think what we're seeing with Klaus and, you know, Davos, World Economic Forum, this is moving to a global scale where they're going to do this on the whole picture, right?
[02:27:45.981 --> 02:27:51.226]  The whole world is going to be involved in this big, gigantic restructuring program.
[02:27:51.646 --> 02:27:57.572]  By the way, I do think that just my personal opinion, not advice to you, but I think Bitcoin is a good edge against that kind of
[02:27:58.192 --> 02:27:58.953]  I don't
[02:28:17.827 --> 02:28:18.067]  Right.
[02:28:18.568 --> 02:28:23.893]  So that what's collectivized now, the next generation, their wealth can be stolen, right?
[02:28:23.933 --> 02:28:31.180]  That's why the wars were so beneficial in putting entire generations and future generations into debt.
[02:28:32.101 --> 02:28:34.103]  So now your children, your grandchildren,
[02:28:35.051 --> 02:28:36.572]  Are born into debt slavery.
[02:28:36.992 --> 02:28:38.293]  That's the whole point of this.
[02:28:38.673 --> 02:28:40.554]  It's not even so much about the wars.
[02:28:40.614 --> 02:28:44.275]  I mean, the wars matter, but the wars are not an ends in themselves.
[02:28:44.336 --> 02:28:47.097]  They're the ends to this goal of international debt.
[02:28:47.137 --> 02:28:49.278]  And again, as you know, it even goes worse than that.
[02:28:49.298 --> 02:28:52.539]  It goes deeper and darker than that because it's not just about debt and economics.
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:55.061]  It's also about control.
[02:28:56.141 --> 02:28:57.982]  Control beyond just the economic sphere.
[02:28:58.422 --> 02:29:00.343]  Control of the whole paradigm of life.
[02:29:00.683 --> 02:29:01.544]  The whole biosphere.
[02:29:02.324 --> 02:29:03.345]  Literally, the whole biosphere.
[02:29:04.431 --> 02:29:10.736]  So the next section I want to talk about in Quigley is when he moves to talk about, this is an overlooked chapter, right?
[02:29:10.756 --> 02:29:13.838]  This overlooked chapter about rationalization and science.
[02:29:14.678 --> 02:29:16.019]  And this is about technocracy.
[02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:20.983]  Now this book is mainly known for the later chapter where he talks about
[02:29:22.386 --> 02:29:27.688]  The elite in America funding socialist leftist causes, right?
[02:29:27.728 --> 02:29:33.451]  The power elite, the wealthiest families in the US, why would they be funding these left socialists?
[02:29:33.551 --> 02:29:34.451]  It doesn't make any sense, right?
[02:29:34.491 --> 02:29:36.152]  Communists are against the rich, right?
[02:29:36.172 --> 02:29:37.933]  Why would they fund those kinds of movements?
[02:29:39.087 --> 02:30:07.703]  And that's, again, we'll look at it in a minute, but that's the most famous chapter in this book that everybody knows it for, but there's a more important chapter, I would argue, in the middle, which is this rationalization and science chapter, because that is Quigley back in the 60s saying that the plan is to have a technocracy, the quantification of everything, all of life, including life itself, quantified into moral calculus to decide on the basis of AI and algorithms
[02:30:08.968 --> 02:30:09.868]  Who lives and who dies?
[02:30:10.029 --> 02:30:10.929]  Who has a right to live?
[02:30:11.049 --> 02:30:12.130]  How many people should live?
[02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:13.590]  How many people there should be?
[02:30:13.650 --> 02:30:15.271]  Georgia Guidestones, right?
[02:30:15.371 --> 02:30:15.631]  500 million?
[02:30:16.492 --> 02:30:18.773]  Probably less than that in the real plans.
[02:30:19.553 --> 02:30:21.014]  That's a rationalization of science.
[02:30:21.074 --> 02:30:23.655]  It's not so much science, but scientism, right?
[02:30:24.536 --> 02:30:26.216]  The religion of science that H.G.
[02:30:26.256 --> 02:30:27.757]  Wells talked about in his books.
[02:30:29.278 --> 02:30:33.400]  And so what this means is total control from womb to tomb.
[02:30:35.011 --> 02:30:35.711]  This is Jay Dyer.
[02:30:35.991 --> 02:30:37.512]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:37.592 --> 02:30:40.614]  When we get back, we'll look at more of what Quigley's talking about here.
[02:30:40.854 --> 02:30:41.874]  Why is this so important?
[02:30:42.374 --> 02:30:43.135]  But don't go anywhere.
[02:30:43.195 --> 02:30:43.835]  Stay where you are.
[02:30:45.216 --> 02:30:47.377]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:47.437 --> 02:30:49.298]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:30:49.358 --> 02:30:53.700]  I was looking for some superman vitality or some brain force or something.
[02:30:53.720 --> 02:31:00.162]  I found primal youth, which sounds like a 90s alternative, primal scream and sonic youth.
[02:31:00.182 --> 02:31:01.023]  There's primal youth.
[02:31:02.458 --> 02:31:06.321]  No, I need to snort some pumpkin pops if there's any, just so I have enough energy.
[02:31:06.341 --> 02:31:21.094]  But we were talking about, Quigley, we were talking about rationalization and science this chapter, about the coming technocracy, where he literally says there's going to be smart cities, AI-controlled cities, where everything that you do will be tracked and traced, and you'll actually just be bossed around, right?
[02:31:21.114 --> 02:31:23.676]  You're going to be told what to do by the robots.
[02:31:24.457 --> 02:31:26.238]  And he literally says this back in the 60s.
[02:31:26.278 --> 02:31:32.362]  That's what's so amazing about this book is that this is just one of the many, many examples where we know they're telling us ahead of time what they're going to do.
[02:31:32.382 --> 02:31:46.011]  And the next most important point in this book is when he talks about not just where we're going, but the the plan that they had with the left.
[02:31:47.643 --> 02:31:52.847]  And, you know, if you know about the Reese Committee, that lines up perfectly with what Quigley's talking about.
[02:31:52.947 --> 02:31:55.849]  Remember, Quigley is an apologist for the establishment, right?
[02:31:55.889 --> 02:31:57.370]  This is not an expose book.
[02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:59.112]  This is a book from the establishment.
[02:31:59.592 --> 02:32:01.614]  He's the archivist, historian for the CFR.
[02:32:01.634 --> 02:32:05.597]  This is not like, oh, let me get the word out, let's tell the people what's going on.
[02:32:06.337 --> 02:32:08.359]  This is a, look, we know what's best for you.
[02:32:08.379 --> 02:32:13.464]  We're going to force liberalism down your throat and whether you like it or not, you're going to be liberal.
[02:32:13.484 --> 02:32:15.547]  If you don't, then you're going to die.
[02:32:15.767 --> 02:32:27.379]  And so he goes on to talk about the forces, namely the NGOs, think tanks, private foundations, tax-free foundations.
[02:32:28.618 --> 02:32:32.440]  That pushed so much leftism and liberalism, right?
[02:32:32.480 --> 02:32:37.482]  In this chapter, it's called, it's talking about nuclear rivalry, but it's not about nukes or anything like that.
[02:32:37.502 --> 02:32:50.227]  It's actually about the roundtable groups, the big name foundations, the big name families that put so much money into the media, right?
[02:32:50.247 --> 02:32:53.648]  This was one of their key goals was to fund left media.
[02:32:54.841 --> 02:33:02.404]  And then fund left education to make sure that the university was just packed with all these insane leftists, right?
[02:33:03.345 --> 02:33:06.946]  To brainwash the coming generations into this leftist model.
[02:33:07.586 --> 02:33:13.289]  And the leftist model, of course, is illogical, irrational, just emotion-based, right?
[02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:21.112]  This is why the people are so malleable and so programmable, is because it's an anti-logical position, right?
[02:33:21.332 --> 02:33:22.313]  Don't teach people
[02:33:23.093 --> 02:33:29.715]  The three R's, right, don't teach them classical educational models and pedagogy, rather teach them to be socialized.
[02:33:30.576 --> 02:33:39.859]  And this actually comes up with the founders of American public education, who were funded by these big tax-free foundations, right, not just Charlotte Isserbit's book, but also
[02:33:41.122 --> 02:33:52.727]  You can go back to horseman John Dewey, the founders of American public education, and they literally say that the purpose of public education is not to educate, but to socialize.
[02:33:54.148 --> 02:33:58.730]  To make creatures, beings, silly putty, right?
[02:33:58.830 --> 02:34:02.211]  Gumby people who are basically just able to be socialized.
[02:34:03.052 --> 02:34:07.874]  That's the whole purpose of American education back to its founding.
[02:34:08.914 --> 02:34:10.255]  The public system, I'm saying here, right?
[02:34:10.845 --> 02:34:18.407]  Because for a while there, there was actually some remnant of real education and what was really going on in the private schools and the Ivy League schools.
[02:34:18.447 --> 02:34:30.750]  And now the Ivy League schools are just totally like... I saw an article a couple years ago talking about how almost all the graduates from Harvard totally accept climate change without question.
[02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:31.530]  Every global...
[02:34:32.691 --> 02:34:34.572]  It's just, just regurgitated, right?
[02:34:34.973 --> 02:34:42.560]  But I think maybe even like, you know, 30, 40 years ago, at least the elite, you know, Ivy League people would have had some knowledge, right?
[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:44.342]  I mean, this is the Ivy League stuff, right?
[02:34:44.362 --> 02:34:48.306]  They would have probably known about Trident Hope, because that's who this book was written for, right?
[02:34:48.326 --> 02:34:55.292]  This book was given to CIA section chiefs in the Cold War, because some of them probably said, why are we aiding and funding communists?
[02:34:56.193 --> 02:35:02.525]  Why are we giving these socialists and leftists so much aid when that's who we're supposed to be against, right?
[02:35:03.715 --> 02:35:06.898]  And that's what Quigley is explaining, especially in this chapter.
[02:35:06.918 --> 02:35:12.943]  That's what this chapter is about, is giving money to all of these leftist causes.
[02:35:13.044 --> 02:35:14.765]  Education, media, right?
[02:35:15.346 --> 02:35:19.089]  And it got so popular, this idea, that they had a committee.
[02:35:20.591 --> 02:35:25.795]  I'm saying that it became known that the Reese Committee went and investigated this, and lo and behold, what do you know?
[02:35:25.855 --> 02:35:27.157]  Yes, right?
[02:35:28.007 --> 02:35:33.992]  They are funding all of these left institutions, left media outlets.
[02:35:35.473 --> 02:35:44.720]  And of course, it was all, again, as we said, Rockefeller stuff, all the Rockefeller entities, and they were allied with the British elite.
[02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:52.686]  Here's a whole chapter where he talks, this whole section talks about Harvard, Rockefeller Institute, John D. Rockefeller, Rockefeller education.
[02:35:53.772 --> 02:35:58.616]  And the Milner Roundtable Groups from England, Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[02:36:01.918 --> 02:36:08.503]  He goes on to talk about, ironically, the John Birch Society.
[02:36:09.608 --> 02:36:12.029]  Now, why would Quigley talk about the John Birch Society?
[02:36:12.429 --> 02:36:17.311]  Presumably, John Birch Society is something that Quigley thinks is his enemy, right?
[02:36:17.771 --> 02:36:26.755]  But what he actually says is that the John Birch Society was hitting on the thing that his book is about, but they didn't exactly know how to frame it.
[02:36:27.195 --> 02:36:35.059]  They didn't have that CFR big picture perspective yet, but they were basically hitting on kind of outer edges of what was really going on.
[02:36:35.839 --> 02:36:41.921]  And they figured out that, wait a minute, really rich people are funding all of this leftism, socialism, communism.
[02:36:41.981 --> 02:36:42.261]  Why?
[02:36:42.521 --> 02:36:43.201]  Why are they doing that?
[02:36:44.902 --> 02:36:46.102]  And Quigley kind of makes fun of them.
[02:36:46.142 --> 02:36:48.903]  He says, ha ha ha, the radical right, they're a bunch of idiots, ha ha ha.
[02:36:48.923 --> 02:36:51.484]  They didn't figure out that it was really us all along.
[02:36:51.524 --> 02:36:52.944]  We did it, and it was our plan.
[02:36:53.625 --> 02:36:58.166]  And they still got caught up in the Cold War dialectic, right?
[02:36:58.266 --> 02:37:04.188]  That's what Quigley says was the main problem, was thinking of this in terms of, oh, it's, you know, America versus Moscow.
[02:37:05.319 --> 02:37:15.248]  When just like with Mao, if you read Professor Anthony Sutton, Stalin wouldn't have had what he had without the West aiding him.
[02:37:15.628 --> 02:37:20.613]  If I recall, the gorky automobile plant was actually put there by Ford.
[02:37:21.754 --> 02:37:24.996]  So the West didn't just help build up
[02:37:25.874 --> 02:37:27.595]  Bolsheviks and helped put them in power.
[02:37:28.396 --> 02:37:32.619]  They didn't just help with, you know, the fascists, with Mussolini, with Hitler.
[02:37:33.239 --> 02:37:35.261]  They also literally helped Stalin.
[02:37:36.441 --> 02:37:45.588]  Now, that gets a little more nuanced, but suffice to say that I think at the top, the tip-top, the Cold War was a big-scale dialectic, right?
[02:37:46.548 --> 02:37:51.132]  Which some have characterized as the Third World War, right?
[02:37:51.192 --> 02:37:51.712]  A Cold War.
[02:37:53.123 --> 02:38:00.249]  Now that Harvard socialism, as he titles it here, is what Quigley will go on to call the third way.
[02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:10.658]  And it's important because Clinton, Tony Blair, they were taught, they were inducted into and indoctrinated into this type of convergent system.
[02:38:11.579 --> 02:38:23.192]  So what you're seeing now, what's coming into play now, which is just a continuation of the model from, right, you've got Clinton and this moves into the era of Obama, and now we're into the third, what, Obama administration with Biden, right?
[02:38:23.492 --> 02:38:24.653]  That is this same model.
[02:38:25.274 --> 02:38:28.077]  This is the model that the Democratic Party uses right here.
[02:38:29.098 --> 02:38:29.899]  Yes, exactly.
[02:38:31.380 --> 02:38:36.222]  Now they don't call it third way because they don't really care about like that old 90s terminology doesn't really matter anymore.
[02:38:36.642 --> 02:38:38.763]  Now it's just this full-on great reset, right?
[02:38:38.883 --> 02:38:44.845]  Which is an intention towards austerity, basically, right?
[02:38:44.885 --> 02:38:47.446]  And that's why we've had so much a promotion of the notion of
[02:38:48.627 --> 02:38:49.227]  I don't know.
[02:39:08.374 --> 02:39:08.854]  The U.S.
[02:39:08.874 --> 02:39:10.575]  will lose its superpower status.
[02:39:10.595 --> 02:39:17.920]  It will be integrated into this world federation that a handful of countries, namely China, will dominate.
[02:39:19.341 --> 02:39:20.882]  There will be printed organs.
[02:39:20.922 --> 02:39:22.463]  I don't know why they threw that one in there.
[02:39:22.543 --> 02:39:26.065]  It's not like you're going to get printed organs delivered to your house.
[02:39:26.485 --> 02:39:29.807]  But veganism, this is another important thing, is the control of food.
[02:39:30.207 --> 02:39:30.928]  Veganism, right?
[02:39:31.929 --> 02:39:37.612]  Veganism is crucial to this because diet, the elite say across the board, is what has to be controlled.
[02:39:37.632 --> 02:39:47.736]  And diet is a big part of how they undermine and attack us, which is why you want to look to infowarestore.com for supplements that help sort of guard against this kind of stuff.
[02:39:48.136 --> 02:39:48.917]  Eat the bugs.
[02:39:48.977 --> 02:39:50.197]  You will eat the bugs, right?
[02:39:50.237 --> 02:39:52.818]  The mealworms, the bugs, and even the feces.
[02:39:52.858 --> 02:39:53.479]  I'm not joking.
[02:39:53.839 --> 02:40:00.722]  There's actual plans to take feces and turn that into sustenance, right?
[02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:03.331]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:03.371 --> 02:40:06.073]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of jaysandalsos.com.
[02:40:06.833 --> 02:40:07.874]  We'll be back in just a moment.
[02:40:07.894 --> 02:40:08.494]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:40:09.315 --> 02:40:11.256]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:11.316 --> 02:40:15.539]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, hosting this fourth hour.
[02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:20.723]  I'll be in town for a book signing for my two books.
[02:40:22.329 --> 02:40:29.476]  I want to talk a little bit about Hollywood, because I think the first time I was on with Alex, we went into this somewhat, but we didn't get too deep.
[02:40:29.556 --> 02:40:37.164]  I just want to do an overview of kind of what Hollywood does and how they program us and how they've done this for so long, because fiction is very crucial, right?
[02:40:37.664 --> 02:40:44.291]  Fiction is the key way that you speak to the masses, even more so than, you know, the news, right?
[02:40:44.311 --> 02:40:45.612]  The news cycle is kind of boring.
[02:40:46.773 --> 02:40:54.038]  Not what most people are going to be keyed into, but you can speak directly to the subconscious, right, through fiction.
[02:40:54.258 --> 02:41:03.364]  You can manipulate the archetypes that we perceive in fiction and in stories through either tearing them down and destroying them, right?
[02:41:03.524 --> 02:41:16.473]  So we've seen, for example, the male patriarchal archetype, right, has really been destroyed, really been taken out, especially in the last 10, 20, 30 years through Hollywood.
[02:41:17.373 --> 02:41:22.936]  And of course, as I was sitting here in the studio, so I keep seeing the sort of Kubrick-themed stuff, right?
[02:41:22.956 --> 02:41:27.438]  So the I in the Infowars is Kubrick and is Hal 9000.
[02:41:27.558 --> 02:41:32.600]  And this is taking me back to when I was writing the two books that I did on Hollywood.
[02:41:33.587 --> 02:41:42.089]  And how Kubrick is a fascinating character because it's hard to tell if he was maybe as a conflicted person, right?
[02:41:42.149 --> 02:41:47.050]  So maybe at times he's wanting to get the story out and tell us what's really going on.
[02:41:47.591 --> 02:41:51.472]  And then at times he seems to be kind of co-opted by the system, by the establishment.
[02:41:51.892 --> 02:41:57.373]  Particularly when he wants to do 2001, when he wants to do Barry Lyndon, right?
[02:41:57.413 --> 02:42:00.034]  The establishment comes to him and they say, we want you to, you know,
[02:42:01.174 --> 02:42:02.494]  Uh, to film this, to do this.
[02:42:03.075 --> 02:42:09.476]  And I think it's unfortunate because the arts are always co-opted by the system to promote propaganda.
[02:42:09.696 --> 02:42:11.497]  This goes all the way back to the ancient world.
[02:42:11.557 --> 02:42:12.217]  Plato knew this.
[02:42:12.257 --> 02:42:24.060]  This is why, I'm not saying it's right that he wanted to censor the arts, but this is the reasoning, the rationale that Plato had for the censoring of the arts is because they can be used to basically corrupt and toxify the society.
[02:42:25.472 --> 02:42:29.734]  But Kubrick really showed us so much of what was going on in these great films, right?
[02:42:29.754 --> 02:42:39.839]  So if you look at 2001, this is a classic because here we have the idea of Arthur C. Clarke who's hanging around the occultists, hanging around Crowley, hanging around all these creeps and weirdos.
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:49.584]  And in the actual original screenplay, Clarke has Starchild, this apotheosized baby god, right?
[02:42:49.764 --> 02:42:51.025]  Blowing up the planet.
[02:42:52.352 --> 02:42:52.512]  I don't
[02:43:12.728 --> 02:43:15.609]  Which is one of the later follow-ups that Clark wrote.
[02:43:17.470 --> 02:43:23.892]  The whole sort of battle between Howl and Bowman, it actually ends in the merger of Howlman.
[02:43:25.133 --> 02:43:26.333]  And this is transhumanism, right?
[02:43:26.833 --> 02:43:35.857]  So the way that we get this God character that man becomes, right, the deus ex machina, the man, the God from within the system,
[02:43:37.037 --> 02:43:39.800]  Is through AI, through computers, right?
[02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:46.026]  So, when you have this merger between man and machine, you get the new emergent deity, right?
[02:43:46.066 --> 02:43:48.108]  That's exactly what that whole sequence is about there.
[02:43:48.528 --> 02:43:52.692]  The birth of, right, the God-man who is not Christ, right?
[02:43:52.752 --> 02:43:55.154]  Not Jesus, but the God-man, man himself, right?
[02:43:55.495 --> 02:44:02.061]  Rejecting any sort of transcendent God, but man himself coming and emerging as God from within the system.
[02:44:03.171 --> 02:44:07.073]  And this is what Kubrick is telling us is really the underlying philosophy of the elite.
[02:44:07.933 --> 02:44:08.293]  Literally.
[02:44:08.453 --> 02:44:16.937]  So if you want to understand this whole plan and the very thing that when I first came in the first beginning of the show, what Alex said, what is the big plan?
[02:44:16.977 --> 02:44:17.977]  What are we looking at here, right?
[02:44:18.017 --> 02:44:20.278]  I talked about the age of transition.
[02:44:21.752 --> 02:44:25.074]  The age of transition is what 2001 is about, right?
[02:44:25.234 --> 02:44:26.375]  It's a space odyssey.
[02:44:27.175 --> 02:44:28.176]  What is the odyssey, right?
[02:44:28.196 --> 02:44:29.577]  Well, we think back to Homer, right?
[02:44:29.637 --> 02:44:30.517]  The Iliad, the Odyssey.
[02:44:31.158 --> 02:44:35.480]  And in that story, you have the idea of Odysseus goes on a journey.
[02:44:37.041 --> 02:44:38.642]  He goes and does battles and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:44:38.662 --> 02:44:39.843]  And he has to come back, right?
[02:44:40.563 --> 02:44:41.964]  And it's about the returning home.
[02:44:43.137 --> 02:44:46.700]  This journey of ascent and return, right?
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:54.365]  This is an old alchemical neoplatonic idea of moving out of the One and then returning to the One, the One being some form of God, right?
[02:44:54.886 --> 02:45:05.533]  Point being is just that this story is packed with so much esoteric and occult meaning that when you watch it, when you notice what happens with the Bowman character,
[02:45:06.394 --> 02:45:08.215]  Is that it's literally like the Matrix.
[02:45:08.235 --> 02:45:15.299]  There's a sequence where he sees like forms, like he starts to see geometric platonic forms, right?
[02:45:15.319 --> 02:45:19.461]  When he's passing through the Stargate and then he moves outside of the system.
[02:45:19.501 --> 02:45:23.443]  And so it's almost like Kubrick was portraying a Matrix, right?
[02:45:24.124 --> 02:45:25.745]  Bowman is inside the Matrix.
[02:45:25.785 --> 02:45:28.406]  He's inside this pair, this, yeah, there you go.
[02:45:28.446 --> 02:45:28.826]  Exactly.
[02:45:29.267 --> 02:45:31.448]  This dimension, you could say.
[02:45:32.406 --> 02:45:44.630]  And so, the goal of the occultists, the goal of the transhumanists, is to pass beyond this limitation, this dimensional limitation, to achieve apotheosis, right?
[02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:48.151]  To get outside of time and space and the limitations of time and space.
[02:45:48.191 --> 02:45:51.592]  And they believe that computers and technology will do that.
[02:45:52.172 --> 02:45:58.514]  And that's why techne, tech, has always been their sort of, you know, that's the real magic for them.
[02:46:00.117 --> 02:46:03.341]  So when you hear about magic, when you hear about, oh, what is occult magic?
[02:46:03.361 --> 02:46:04.582]  Well, what is technology?
[02:46:04.642 --> 02:46:07.505]  Remember Arthur C. Clarke's third law, right?
[02:46:07.906 --> 02:46:12.231]  There's no distinction between sufficiently advanced technology and magic.
[02:46:13.680 --> 02:46:25.326]  So if you want to understand how to reconcile magic, so-called, the occult idea, alchemy, and quote, technology, which by the way, many of the occultists themselves believe is a reconciled system.
[02:46:25.706 --> 02:46:27.527]  They think it's actually hitting at the same point.
[02:46:27.787 --> 02:46:29.969]  This goes back to what Blavatsky taught this, right?
[02:46:30.289 --> 02:46:35.672]  Theosophy as a whole, this whole system is about kind of a luminous scientism, basically.
[02:46:36.152 --> 02:46:37.873]  That's where you find this convergence, right?
[02:46:37.913 --> 02:46:41.775]  And you will find all of that literally in 2001 A Space Odyssey.
[02:46:42.537 --> 02:46:46.220]  And I would add, too, that it's not just about the tech and the transhumanism.
[02:46:46.300 --> 02:46:56.769]  If you go further into Kubrick's canon, and you go back and watch The Shining, what's amazing about The Shining is that this is a movie about abuse and trauma.
[02:46:58.010 --> 02:46:59.091]  Trauma-based mind control.
[02:47:00.472 --> 02:47:03.935]  Think about, right, you've got the Jack Nicholson character.
[02:47:06.513 --> 02:47:10.598]  Who it's very clearly hinted at in the film has abused his son.
[02:47:11.059 --> 02:47:16.266]  The reason for the dissociation in the son is because Jack Nicholson has abused him.
[02:47:16.366 --> 02:47:17.608]  And why has Jack Nicholson?
[02:47:17.648 --> 02:47:19.070]  Well, because it's generational.
[02:47:19.590 --> 02:47:19.731]  Right?
[02:47:20.384 --> 02:47:27.451]  If you heard yesterday's show, Alex was talking about the abuse that goes on by the elite, particularly the Super Bowl, right, with the human trafficking, this kind of stuff.
[02:47:27.872 --> 02:47:29.373]  That's what is in this Kubrick film.
[02:47:29.453 --> 02:47:37.801]  Literally almost every one of Kubrick's films in some way, maybe not 2001, but most of them have this reference to the abuse of the young.
[02:47:38.772 --> 02:47:50.422]  The taking of innocence, which is a big part of how they traumatize and brainwash people on a micro scale that they then project on a macro scale through the mass public rituals like the Super Bowl, right?
[02:47:50.823 --> 02:47:52.785]  Or the big terror events, right?
[02:47:52.805 --> 02:47:53.705]  This kind of stuff, right?
[02:47:54.665 --> 02:48:03.707]  So in The Shining, what you have is this abuse that goes on, and I believe that it's really talking about a spiritual battle.
[02:48:04.347 --> 02:48:07.128]  This film is about the spiritual warfare that goes on.
[02:48:07.788 --> 02:48:14.410]  The Overlook Hotel, it's really symbolic of this kind of haunted situation that we're entering into.
[02:48:14.430 --> 02:48:18.511]  It's haunted America, is basically what the hotel represents.
[02:48:19.051 --> 02:48:24.814]  That's why there's all those references to the Indian gods and the previous inhabitants and so forth.
[02:48:25.095 --> 02:48:30.618]  But the way that I know that is that specific sequence where you see, yeah, he's talking to the ghosts, right?
[02:48:30.638 --> 02:48:32.099]  The spirits of the dead and so forth.
[02:48:32.399 --> 02:48:35.100]  There's a specific sequence where we start to realize that this hotel
[02:48:36.121 --> 02:48:39.322]  The manager says, right, is where the jet set used to hang out.
[02:48:39.422 --> 02:48:40.522]  The elite, right?
[02:48:40.682 --> 02:48:48.404]  And this is why Jack Nicholson starts to have these visions of these elaborate parties in the 20s and 30s and the gold room, right?
[02:48:48.804 --> 02:48:50.025]  So all this alchemical image.
[02:48:50.985 --> 02:48:55.266]  And the elite of that time, the jets, the British royals, right?
[02:48:55.466 --> 02:48:58.767]  The royalty even stay there, the manager says.
[02:48:59.407 --> 02:49:01.668]  And so that clues us into who's running the system.
[02:49:03.260 --> 02:49:09.124]  Maybe that suggests another, right, theme from Kubrick which we find in Eyes Wide Shut, right?
[02:49:09.164 --> 02:49:16.048]  Which is the elite with their secret societies, with their cults, with their secret doctrines, their gnosis, right?
[02:49:16.128 --> 02:49:22.613]  The same theme and what else is in Eyes Wide Shut but the abuse of the young, human trafficking, right?
[02:49:22.653 --> 02:49:23.874]  This comes up in Barry Lyndon.
[02:49:24.194 --> 02:49:25.835]  This comes up in Lolita.
[02:49:26.670 --> 02:49:26.850]  Right?
[02:49:27.171 --> 02:49:27.691]  Kubrick film.
[02:49:27.771 --> 02:49:34.118]  Kubrick is constantly talking about this and showing us what's going on, but the public's eyes are wide shut.
[02:49:34.498 --> 02:49:34.719]  Right?
[02:49:35.119 --> 02:49:40.885]  But what is the purpose, I think, of these films is in a dark sense a kind of a ritual initiation.
[02:49:41.706 --> 02:49:44.269]  I think the films themselves are an initiation.
[02:49:44.789 --> 02:49:44.969]  Right?
[02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:48.813]  We are almost like kind of the Tom Cruise character.
[02:49:50.115 --> 02:49:53.317]  Bill Harford is sort of being led along this journey throughout the film.
[02:49:54.057 --> 02:49:58.639]  And yeah, there's surrealist elements where we don't know if this is a waking state, a dream state, or whatever.
[02:49:59.039 --> 02:50:04.962]  But the point is that the Bill Harford character and Alice, Alice in Wonderland, right?
[02:50:05.002 --> 02:50:06.263]  The Nicole Kidman character, right?
[02:50:06.583 --> 02:50:09.564]  They go through this process and they are initiated.
[02:50:09.584 --> 02:50:11.265]  They see how the world really works.
[02:50:11.305 --> 02:50:16.968]  You've got high-powered, elite, super wealthy people into the occult, into this dark stuff.
[02:50:17.828 --> 02:50:18.968]  It involves human trafficking.
[02:50:19.408 --> 02:50:21.889]  Again, Kubrick was telling us this, right?
[02:50:21.989 --> 02:50:27.711]  This is what, 1988, excuse me, 1999 film, Eyes Wide Shut, and it's all about what's out now.
[02:50:28.271 --> 02:50:29.611]  Epstein, right, this kind of stuff.
[02:50:30.832 --> 02:50:31.952]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:31.972 --> 02:50:33.132]  I'm Jay Dyer of Jaysonalysis.
[02:50:33.152 --> 02:50:35.993]  You can get my books, Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, at jaysonalysis.
[02:50:40.414 --> 02:50:43.355]  Every past generation has gone through terror.
[02:50:44.015 --> 02:50:46.076]  We've faced different permutations of oppression.
[02:50:47.318 --> 02:50:56.649]  But in the modern world, it is a sophisticated, creeping political and corporate cultural system that really seeks to divide and conquer and dumb us all down.
[02:50:57.090 --> 02:51:04.058]  Now we live in this giant cancel culture, where hundreds of millions of people, not just in America, but all over the world,
[02:51:04.759 --> 02:51:07.581]  Really, billions are being suppressed and controlled by AI.
[02:51:08.241 --> 02:51:19.929]  It is more important than ever in the third dimension here on the ground that bumper stickers, license plates, t-shirts, InfoWars.com on the side of your barn or launch your own website, I don't care.
[02:51:20.289 --> 02:51:24.092]  Just speak up and don't comply and don't go along with the Great Reset.
[02:51:24.152 --> 02:51:25.753]  Don't go along with Operation Lockstep.
[02:51:26.033 --> 02:51:30.476]  Don't go along with Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Joe Biden and all these other criminals.
[02:51:30.956 --> 02:51:35.678]  So, a listener sent me an idea for a t-shirt, and it looked basically like this.
[02:51:35.718 --> 02:51:38.999]  We had our graphics department kind of beef it up and make it more high-res.
[02:51:39.279 --> 02:51:43.181]  And it's a New York-style license plate saying, FK Mask.
[02:51:43.861 --> 02:51:48.063]  And I'm not normally kind of catty like that, but seriously, F the Globalist saying we're dirty.
[02:51:48.543 --> 02:51:50.364]  F the Globalist trying to make us submit to them.
[02:51:51.104 --> 02:51:53.125]  Fauci, all of them admit the masks are permanent.
[02:51:53.165 --> 02:51:57.146]  They want a five-year lockdown to totally bankrupt all small businesses.
[02:51:57.826 --> 02:52:01.967]  And it's time for people to realize that top scientists admit the masks don't even protect you.
[02:52:02.427 --> 02:52:03.448]  It's a sign that you're dirty.
[02:52:03.488 --> 02:52:04.408]  It's a sign that you're bad.
[02:52:04.428 --> 02:52:05.308]  It's a sign that you're evil.
[02:52:05.668 --> 02:52:08.729]  It's a sign that you submit to the big lie that you're not essential.
[02:52:08.769 --> 02:52:10.470]  So I have this new great t-shirt.
[02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:11.370]  A limited edition.
[02:52:11.390 --> 02:52:12.490]  I think it's going to be a bestseller.
[02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:14.391]  And it's FK Mask.
[02:52:14.411 --> 02:52:17.291]  And on the back, InfoWars.com.
[02:52:17.432 --> 02:52:18.972]  But what about F Biden?
[02:52:19.472 --> 02:52:19.853]  That's right.
[02:52:19.873 --> 02:52:21.374]  The most popular president in U.S.
[02:52:21.414 --> 02:52:21.814]  history.
[02:52:22.275 --> 02:52:23.796]  The president-elect forever.
[02:52:24.596 --> 02:52:25.577]  Our leader, our king.
[02:52:25.637 --> 02:52:26.458]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[02:52:26.738 --> 02:52:27.479]  China Joe.
[02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:31.242]  We have another great variant of this license plate shirt.
[02:52:32.003 --> 02:52:32.703]  F-5.
[02:52:33.023 --> 02:52:35.626]  And again, this is a major thought crime.
[02:52:35.686 --> 02:52:37.787]  We are not worshipping our dear leader.
[02:52:38.288 --> 02:52:44.273]  The Democrats and MSN have said it should be illegal to even criticize him or say he stole the election.
[02:52:45.074 --> 02:52:47.576]  So, we're going to exercise our first amendment in the face of the tyrants.
[02:52:48.076 --> 02:52:51.839]  I'm going to get this second limited edition shirt at M4WorksStore.com while you still can.
[02:52:51.859 --> 02:52:53.380]  This one's really politically incorrect.
[02:52:53.940 --> 02:52:54.521]  F-tyranny.
[02:52:54.861 --> 02:52:55.861]  F-GGFang.
[02:52:56.362 --> 02:53:00.064]  Yes, the third in this new line of limited editions.
[02:53:00.645 --> 02:53:01.225]  F-tyranny.
[02:53:01.706 --> 02:53:02.266]  F-Biden.
[02:53:02.766 --> 02:53:03.347]  F-the-mass.
[02:53:03.567 --> 02:53:05.648]  All available at M4WorksStore.com.
[02:53:05.948 --> 02:53:06.449]  But wait!
[02:53:07.591 --> 02:53:09.252]  There's more, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:09.592 --> 02:53:11.453]  This design is already a bestseller.
[02:53:11.473 --> 02:53:12.433]  It came out a month ago.
[02:53:12.933 --> 02:53:14.454]  And people are ordering like hotcakes.
[02:53:14.574 --> 02:53:15.595]  Biden is so upset.
[02:53:15.815 --> 02:53:17.575]  How dare you thought criminals promote this?
[02:53:17.896 --> 02:53:18.956]  How dare you wear this?
[02:53:19.676 --> 02:53:20.637]  Trader Joe's.
[02:53:21.197 --> 02:53:28.340]  To the four nations on record, Russia, China, Ukraine, you name it, Iran, that Biden has sold us out to.
[02:53:28.680 --> 02:53:34.403]  Do what Tim Cook says, you dirty Americans, and do not get the Trader Joe's shirt at InfoWarsTore.com, whatever you do.
[02:53:35.123 --> 02:53:38.666]  Don't get this best-selling hat we've had out for six years.
[02:53:39.066 --> 02:53:39.706]  1776, baby.
[02:53:40.087 --> 02:53:41.047]  Made in America.
[02:53:41.488 --> 02:53:42.929]  InfoWars.com.
[02:53:43.249 --> 02:53:45.050]  Do not visit InfoWars.com.
[02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:46.992]  Give up, roll over, and die.
[02:53:47.432 --> 02:53:50.174]  Don't go to the organization Fighting Tyranny for 27 years.
[02:53:50.434 --> 02:53:53.777]  Don't go to the group that raised the alarm first and has been the most hardcore.
[02:53:54.477 --> 02:53:55.758]  Give up to Fauci.
[02:53:56.359 --> 02:53:57.359]  Give up to Gates.
[02:53:57.559 --> 02:53:58.800]  Give up to Klaus Schwab.
[02:53:58.901 --> 02:53:59.701]  Give up to Biden.
[02:53:59.781 --> 02:54:01.102]  It'll go better for you.
[02:54:01.402 --> 02:54:02.503]  Take the shots.
[02:54:02.904 --> 02:54:03.844]  Stay in your house.
[02:54:04.225 --> 02:54:05.165]  You're obsolete.
[02:54:05.305 --> 02:54:06.306]  Don't fight back.
[02:54:06.707 --> 02:54:10.830]  Don't go to infowarestore.com and get these shirts and wear it out in public.
[02:54:11.530 --> 02:54:13.071]  Submit to the Democrats.
[02:54:13.432 --> 02:54:14.693]  Submit to the Satanists.
[02:54:15.233 --> 02:54:16.394]  Or fight back what you've been doing.
[02:54:16.894 --> 02:54:18.255]  Seriously, folks, thanks for your support.
