[00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.138]  Back in 1948, George Orwell said that in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:00:07.178 --> 00:00:08.359]  He was totally right then.
[00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.125]  So it takes a lot of courage in this modern world not to tell lies.
[00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:15.388]  Oh, that's honored, that's protected, that's pushed.
[00:00:15.908 --> 00:00:17.911]  It takes a lot of courage to tell the truth.
[00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.832]  In a system of universal deceit.
[00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:22.754]  And Tony Robbins has just done that again.
[00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:27.518]  He called out the whole Me Too culture as a victimology fraud of control.
[00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:40.067]  And now he's called out, using scientific evidence, John Hopkins reports and other facts, the reality that COVID-19 is a giant psychological warfare system taking control of our consciousness and our focus.
[00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:42.089]  So here's some of what he had to say.
[00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:49.675]  The same number of people have died this year, 2020, has died in 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
[00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:51.316]  2.8 million people.
[00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:54.379]  Heart disease, for the first time in 30 years, has come down.
[00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.280]  Cancer has come down.
[00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.803]  But COVID has gone up in the exact proportions.
[00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:03.126]  Now that's interesting, isn't it?
[00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:04.427]  Same number of people died.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.402]  Since I was a teenager watching Anthony Robbins, I liked him because he was about being positive and people that are in a victim mentality can never get anything done.
[00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:30.765]  He talks a lot about not letting people take control of your focus or your destiny and how you can still stand up for yourself and fight corruption, but not give your soul and your essence over to these people.
[00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:35.326]  And that's my problem is I get so sick of the new world order and so sick of these corrupt corporations.
[00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:41.673]  And so sick of these bad people that I spend all my time studying what they're up to so I can fight them.
[00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:43.655]  But it's a paradox.
[00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:44.516]  I know how to fight them.
[00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:45.777]  I'm very successful against them.
[00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:47.439]  But at the same time...
[00:01:48.652 --> 00:01:50.634]  They are the focus of my life and it's killing me.
[00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:58.180]  So I've been researching a lot of what he has to say lately, particularly about being able to stand up to corruption and bad stuff at the same time not making your focus.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.862]  Still deal with it, but not let it get to you.
[00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:04.265]  And that really is hard to do when you're not a sociopath and have a soul.
[00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:07.868]  And I know that Robbins has a soul as well, but he's been able to navigate that because
[00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.333]  This is a very toxic environment with some very bad, corrupt people that want our attention.
[00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:18.397]  And I've come to that realization years ago, and I know Robbins came to it decades ago, but it's true.
[00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:22.600]  It's like saying the Greek gods didn't exist if people didn't believe in them.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.282]  And so if they weren't being worshipped, they kind of disappeared.
[00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:31.247]  To me, that's the allegory of what's going on here, or the parallel, the analogy.
[00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:51.932]  And so shifting gears into what he's currently talking about, here's a quick video that's gone viral on Twitter where he lays out the actual numbers that are dead on about the fact that they're listing all these people that died of other things, the flu, pneumonia, car wrecks, heart disease, cancer in the COVID column and showing people in all these hazmat suits and creating this hysteria.
[00:02:52.012 --> 00:02:53.313]  And then he just walks through
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:03.523]  The facts that COVID is a thing that take all of our attention and steer us as a tar baby into this great reset, this giant lockdown.
[00:03:03.603 --> 00:03:05.743]  So how do you face a global lockdown?
[00:03:05.783 --> 00:03:06.764]  How do you face fear?
[00:03:07.104 --> 00:03:08.104]  How do you face panic?
[00:03:08.144 --> 00:03:10.045]  How do you face people wearing a mask?
[00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:13.946]  They know it's a fraud, but because they want to look like a hero because they don't want to be criticized.
[00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:21.628]  How do you fight that and come out of that and resist that, but at the same time, not give it your focus and not let it depress you?
[00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:23.509]  That really is the $64 trillion question.
[00:03:24.844 --> 00:03:26.486]  Just go read John Hopkins' report.
[00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.789]  They took it down after one day, but two weeks ago they came out here in America.
[00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.376]  They took it down, but if you go on the Wayback Machine, you know, you can go back on your computer and go back in time on the web.
[00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:43.016]  So people have already published it again and again, and what it shows is the same number of people have died this year, 2020, has died in 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
[00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:43.417]  2.8 million people.
[00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:44.397]  It's within 10 to 15,000 people every year.
[00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:45.919]  The same number of old people died in 2020.
[00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:58.752]  The only difference is when they looked by disease.
[00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:02.073]  Heart disease, for the first time in 30 years, has come down.
[00:04:02.093 --> 00:04:04.014]  Cancer has come down!
[00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:07.516]  But COVID has gone up in the exact proportions!
[00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:10.837]  Now that's interesting, isn't it?
[00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:12.177]  Same number of people die.
[00:04:13.718 --> 00:04:16.579]  By the way, in case you haven't noticed, the flu has disappeared!
[00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.900]  It's flatlined!
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.801]  What are the symptoms of the flu?
[00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:23.402]  And by the way, flu kills people, and especially kills older people.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:33.224]  So we're living in a world where a lot of people might be overreacting because they're trying to protect us because they thought at a 3% mortality rate, or 4%, that would be a pandemic.
[00:04:34.344 --> 00:04:40.247]  But today, figuring out whose research you read, it's 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, which is the same as the flu.
[00:04:41.268 --> 00:04:43.289]  And if you're under 50, it's way below that.
[00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:50.252]  So we live in a world that if we let people control our focus, we're just going to live in fear and do nothing.
[00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:53.318]  And we're going to be people that manage our circumstances.
[00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.361]  So in closing, what Tony said is totally true.
[00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:59.984]  If it was really 3, 4, 5 percent dying, that would be something to be scared of.
[00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:02.586]  But it's not even 1 tenth of 1 percent.
[00:05:02.826 --> 00:05:03.507]  It's a fraud.
[00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:06.049]  And now they admit the vaccine doesn't protect you.
[00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:08.411]  Even Macron has come out and said that.
[00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:13.595]  The Australian government had to stop giving their vaccines because it comes up with HIV positive when you take it.
[00:05:14.055 --> 00:05:17.718]  Now Merck has pulled back and says the vaccine doesn't work, so they're suspending their two vaccines.
[00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.180]  This is a giant power grab.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.461]  This is a giant tar baby of fear and control.
[00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:27.323]  And the big corporations and big pharma pushing this are the bad guys.
[00:05:27.763 --> 00:05:29.063]  Bill Gates is the bad guy.
[00:05:29.403 --> 00:05:30.744]  Klaus Schwab is the bad guy.
[00:05:31.044 --> 00:05:32.945]  They're telling you that you're inherently dirty.
[00:05:33.205 --> 00:05:34.585]  They're telling you that you're inherently bad.
[00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.707]  You've got to wear a mask over your face like you're ugly and you're evil.
[00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:40.228]  They admit it's about a post-human world.
[00:05:40.288 --> 00:05:42.489]  It's about a giant authoritarian power grab.
[00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:49.172]  Klaus Schwab says that any business or company that deals with in-person, person-to-action, is going to be obsolete.
[00:05:50.112 --> 00:06:00.817]  This is 21st century war, and so join Tony Robbins, join myself, join others, black, white, old, young, no matter where you live in the world, Christian, Muslim, agnostic, Buddhist, it doesn't matter.
[00:06:01.137 --> 00:06:07.340]  If you want to be free, and you recognize what's happening, then speak out and say no to this fraud.
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.741]  We're going to win, but it's going to take courage.
[00:06:09.821 --> 00:06:13.383]  If you wait, things are going to get so bad, you'll be forced to take action.
[00:06:13.783 --> 00:06:22.587]  Take action now before this Greek reset really sets in, because it is modern warfare, it is a power grab, and it must be resisted.
[00:06:22.807 --> 00:06:32.452]  But I want to salute Robbins and others that have courage, who have a lot to lose for standing up and telling the truth, because they understand we're all going to lose everything if we don't take action now.
[00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:38.744]  So we live in a world that if we let people control our focus, we're just going to live in fear and do nothing.
[00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:41.771]  And we're going to be people that manage our circumstances.
[00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:53.676]  This is the American dream.
[00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:56.798]  Independent companies supplying the American people.
[00:06:56.838 --> 00:07:02.542]  Behind me is the 400,000 square foot facility for MyPatriotSupply, one of our biggest supporters.
[00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.923]  They have so many Americas working for them.
[00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:09.166]  The food, the products, it's all right here from America, right to your door.
[00:07:09.506 --> 00:07:12.608]  We're not funded by Bill Gates or George Soros, the globalist.
[00:07:12.628 --> 00:07:18.793]  We are funded by you supporting us at Infowarsstore.com with amazing American companies like MyPatriotSupply.
[00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:21.775]  Now again, most companies buy in bulk.
[00:07:22.655 --> 00:07:27.078]  And then they advertise and have a really high price, so they make a profit off that food.
[00:07:27.098 --> 00:07:28.760]  But they don't produce it themselves.
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.181]  They don't stockpile it fresh.
[00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:35.644]  Almost all of this is coming off the assembly line and what being shipped out in a day or two.
[00:07:35.725 --> 00:07:36.325]  Absolutely.
[00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:39.187]  So this game lord right here is going to go back to our keating team.
[00:07:39.707 --> 00:07:41.909]  By tomorrow, these pouches are going to be inside of buckets.
[00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:43.970]  And the next day, those buckets are going to be out the door.
[00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.112]  So Joe, tell us what we're doing right here in the factory.
[00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:48.073]  So this is our shipping station right here, Alex.
[00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:51.494]  And this is actually InfoWorth orders that are going out at this very moment.
[00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:53.635]  Like this order right here for Steven.
[00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:58.917]  Steven lives in California and he's going to get a special autographed pick ticket from Alex Jones.
[00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.358]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:01.738]  Pleasure getting some great storable food.
[00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:02.859]  So I'm your Christmas elf.
[00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:05.380]  A little bit late in the year, but thank you so much for your support, brother.
[00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:09.980]  Yeah, we're shipping products, you know, hundreds of packages per day through our state-of-the-art conveyor system.
[00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:12.022]  This is really the state-of-the-art thing.
[00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:15.766]  I think Amazon is what's comparable to what we do here at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:08:16.147 --> 00:08:17.508]  This is Len from Alabama.
[00:08:17.548 --> 00:08:19.070]  Len ordered for Infowars.com.
[00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.411]  Her order is going out this afternoon.
[00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:22.573]  It's going to be on a truck here in the next couple of minutes.
[00:08:22.613 --> 00:08:23.855]  It's going to be on her way to land.
[00:08:24.455 --> 00:08:26.537]  Lynn from Alabama, we love you, we appreciate you.
[00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:28.178]  You made the right choice with this horrible food.
[00:08:28.198 --> 00:08:29.579]  This is insurance you can eat.
[00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:31.481]  And when did they put this order in?
[00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:32.421]  I want to see how fast it's going up.
[00:08:32.782 --> 00:08:36.945]  You know, this order was actually put in, I think, two days ago and it's already going out the door right now.
[00:08:36.965 --> 00:08:42.229]  So, two days ago, fresh food, produced, packaged, right here in America, the whole nine yards.
[00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:43.450]  This is the American dream.
[00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.935]  This is American capitalism bringing us exceptionalism, bringing us more choices, and we thank you for keeping us on the air.
[00:08:50.095 --> 00:08:50.715]  Thank you so much.
[00:08:51.744 --> 00:08:57.255]  I've ordered a lot of high quality food from you guys over the years, but it just gets better and better tasting and the selection is so huge.
[00:08:57.696 --> 00:09:01.925]  And I was just walking around here, how many different variants and products do you have?
[00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:04.455]  We have hundreds of different products.
[00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:09.618]  And you know, when you're talking about food, I mean freeze-dried fruits, freeze-dried vegetables, freeze-dried meats, ready-made meals.
[00:09:09.698 --> 00:09:15.863]  Just the ready-made meals that we have, the ones that come inside of the four-week kit, there's going to be at least 18 different varieties that we offer.
[00:09:15.983 --> 00:09:20.165]  And we keep expanding that as we do more research, as we do more configurations.
[00:09:20.205 --> 00:09:21.506]  We're going to be adding different meals.
[00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:23.868]  Your food was great 12 years ago, but now it's amazing.
[00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:35.030]  Chicken noodle, vegetarian taco, potato, cheese, cheesy broccoli rice, brown sugar oatmeal, potato cheddar, rice, peanut butter, corn chowder, white rice, sugar.
[00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.451]  You got wheat honey bread, whey milk, you'll have traveler stew, chicken noodle.
[00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:41.392]  Oh, I like traveler stew.
[00:09:41.612 --> 00:09:43.412]  Traveler stew is one of our more popular ones.
[00:09:43.432 --> 00:09:44.592]  Chicken noodle, it's excellent.
[00:09:44.872 --> 00:09:45.072]  Yep.
[00:09:45.232 --> 00:09:49.773]  I mean, we have almost anything that you would eat on a regular basis packaged in the long-term food stores.
[00:09:49.813 --> 00:09:50.633]  They've got everything, folks.
[00:09:50.653 --> 00:09:52.374]  You've got to check it out at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:53.634]  The entire selection there.
[00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:57.796]  Literally, within a day or two of your order coming in, it's being shipped out to you.
[00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:00.958]  If it's local, in Utah, it's on those small trucks.
[00:10:01.378 --> 00:10:03.379]  If it's outside Utah, it's on big 18 wheelers.
[00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:08.062]  Again, that's why MyPatriot, with Ready Hour, has become the number one swerveable food company in the world.
[00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:13.385]  Because of quality, because of service, because of reliability, and because of good word of mouth.
[00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:17.327]  So I want to thank you all for supporting us and supporting our great supplier, MyPatriot.
[00:10:29.303 --> 00:10:32.913]  Right here in America and it funds the M4 Wars.
[00:10:32.953 --> 00:10:35.199]  Go to m4warsstore.com today and get prepared!
