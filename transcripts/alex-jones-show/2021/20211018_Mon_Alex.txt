[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.390]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.791]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:04.032]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:05.453]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:06.234]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.394 --> 00:00:06.955]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:08.196]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:12.259]  They tune in right here!
[00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:13.820]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.081]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:31.301]  today.
[00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:33.152]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:40.236]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:00:41.777 --> 00:00:44.959]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:48.641]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:50.643]  For beholden to scum!
[00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:52.942]  Russian scum!
[00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:58.942]  [Music]
[00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:00.942]  Listen! Please listen!
[00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:09.717]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.500]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.700]  Sleep.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700]  Sleep.
[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.700]  Sleep.
[00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.700]  Lock the door, lock the door!
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.700]  We're coming!
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.700]  We're coming!
[00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:24.459]  Help!
[00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.219]  Help!
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.181]  They're coming!
[00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:27.081]  They're coming!
[00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:27.782]  Listen to me!
[00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:28.743]  Listen!
[00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:29.444]  Help me!
[00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:30.385]  You're next!
[00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:30.866]  Please!
[00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:31.526]  Please!
[00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:32.227]  You're next!
[00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:33.128]  We're in danger!
[00:01:33.348 --> 00:01:34.169]  Please listen to me!
[00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:35.170]  It's something terrible!
[00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.310]  Please!
[00:01:39.722 --> 00:01:41.082]  They're coming!
[00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:43.783]  Sleep.
[00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:44.984]  The seed is planted.
[00:01:45.044 --> 00:01:45.804]  Sleep.
[00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:47.765]  Sleep.
[00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:49.066]  Terror grows.
[00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:49.526]  Sleep.
[00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.387]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:01:51.407 --> 00:01:52.627]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:54.328]  Sit up!
[00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:56.789]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.970]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.231]  Is it contagious?
[00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.372]  It looked right at me.
[00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:04.652]  You need to get out!
[00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:06.933]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:07.834]  It was not human.
[00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:13.227]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.189]  We're being cornered!
[00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.193]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.935]  They're barricading the street.
[00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:22.397]  Invasion of the body slashers.
[00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:24.237]  of the body statues.
[00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:27.237]  Who's the head of the walking dead?
[00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:50.237]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:53.326]  It's Monday, October 18th.
[00:02:53.326 --> 00:03:06.127]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[00:03:06.156 --> 00:03:06.496]  We think.
[00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:07.076]  Just let me think.
[00:03:07.096 --> 00:03:12.659]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:13.460]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:21.782]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:03:22.343 --> 00:03:25.509]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:33.108]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:34.108]  You designed it, sir.
[00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:35.088]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:36.549]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.250]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:50.293]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:50.473]  Cameras.
[00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:51.233]  We need cameras.
[00:03:51.513 --> 00:03:52.313]  How did this happen?
[00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:53.714]  Who's to blame?
[00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:57.340]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.283]  They will be held accountable.
[00:03:59.303 --> 00:04:05.175]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:08.084]  I know why you did it.
[00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:09.404]  I know you were afraid.
[00:04:09.844 --> 00:04:10.565]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:11.485]  War?
[00:04:11.825 --> 00:04:12.285]  Terror?
[00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:13.126]  Disease?
[00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:19.829]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.049]  Fear got the best of you.
[00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.911]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:28.712]  He promised you order.
[00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:29.973]  He promised you peace.
[00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:34.312]   And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:04:34.312 --> 00:04:42.312]  There is a war.
[00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:43.535]  It's happening now.
[00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.215]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:48.556]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:50.816]  We are the resistance.
[00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:53.497]  We are the Infowar.
[00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:59.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, Colin Powell is dead.
[00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:01.838]  Fully vaccinated with COVID-19.
[00:05:01.978 --> 00:05:05.559]  Is dead from blowback of his own weapon system.
[00:05:07.148 --> 00:05:10.490]  Hitler, of course, helped fire nerve gas in World War I. It almost killed him.
[00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:13.553]  So, Colin Powell, a casualty of their own operation.
[00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:23.940]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Monday, October 18th, 2021, worldwide transmission.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:35.629]  We're going to be here for the next four hours, and I've cleared out all the guests today because I want to be able to cover all of this massive, incredibly important news and information.
[00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.014]  And I want to be able to take your phone calls as well.
[00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:44.118]  So thank you for joining us on this Monday, October 18th, 2021 transmission.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.820]  Okay.
[00:05:46.962 --> 00:05:54.470]  I'm first going to say this, and I don't say this to score a three pointer or to score a slam dunk.
[00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.834]  I do this because this is why we're in so much trouble.
[00:05:59.215 --> 00:06:06.980]  I took off part of last week to spend time with my family and all of my children and took them to Florida to the beach.
[00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:14.324]  But I did some research and did some hosting, as you heard, because you just can't drag me away, obviously.
[00:06:14.885 --> 00:06:18.167]  History's happening right in front of our faces, and I don't want to just be run over by it.
[00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:21.309]  I want to be a participant in it, and I want to have some control of my destiny.
[00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:32.785]   But Friday when I'm flying back, Friday morning, I actually see it on the CNN monitors at the airport.
[00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:43.236]  Blood testing under the new global COVID vaccine passport will ensure that you do not have COVID as the new test.
[00:06:44.678 --> 00:06:47.541]  And so I get on the plane, I'm on my phone.
[00:06:49.082 --> 00:06:53.985]  So-called phone, this digital tracking surveillance platform, they call a phone, this Trojan horse.
[00:06:55.025 --> 00:06:57.907]  And I noticed Paul Watson did an article about it and did a video about it.
[00:06:57.947 --> 00:07:02.049]  He focused on the blood, how they're going to take your blood to travel.
[00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:14.956]  And then I noticed Saturday and Sunday, no one ran headlines, not even, and maybe I missed it, but Zero Hedge is one of the only groups that is sometimes, a lot of the time, even ahead of me.
[00:07:17.196 --> 00:07:18.437]  And no one picked it up.
[00:07:18.717 --> 00:07:20.178]  No one picked it up.
[00:07:20.258 --> 00:07:21.739]  Not Paul Watson at Infowars.
[00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:22.919]  Or Summit.News.
[00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:24.000]  Not Zero Hedge.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.760]  No one.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.703]  I thought, well surely Climate Depot and Mark Moreno is going to be on this.
[00:07:30.223 --> 00:07:31.144]  Went over there, wasn't there.
[00:07:31.344 --> 00:07:32.004]  Maybe it's there now.
[00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:33.745]  And do you know what it is?
[00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:45.212]  Do you think them saying they're going to take your blood every time you travel with a new test owned and certified by the UN is the only one they can use that's now owned by Bill Gates and Soros that created the company a year ago and set it up?
[00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:47.794]  That's all scamming of itself.
[00:07:48.454 --> 00:07:50.155]  But that's not the big story.
[00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:52.676]  And again, that's how they do it.
[00:07:52.857 --> 00:08:01.381]  CNN, ABC News, all of them ran with World Economic Forum unveils COVID passport that uses blood test markers to determine vaccination status.
[00:08:06.144 --> 00:08:08.906]  Do you know what was actually in the Davos Group announcement?
[00:08:11.317 --> 00:08:17.720]  I've got, I've counted it, ten giant announcements and the blood is the least of them.
[00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:20.381]  Ten.
[00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:24.583]  I've got the transcript right here, I've got screenshots of their...
[00:08:25.925 --> 00:08:27.205]  We're going to play the video again.
[00:08:27.725 --> 00:08:29.066]  And folks, I got tons of news to cover.
[00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:33.627]  I'm not going to cover the same thing I covered last night, you know, because I don't have something to cover.
[00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:45.130]  It'd be like if Martians landed in Washington, D.C., I wouldn't be talking about the price of oil, or I wouldn't be talking about how much coffee beans cost, or how somebody got shot down at the liquor store.
[00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.010]  This is the Big Daddy.
[00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.911]  Let's put the live show headline up if we can.
[00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:53.132]  Because that's what this is.
[00:08:53.972 --> 00:08:59.275]  Mark of the Beast system officially announced.
[00:09:00.796 --> 00:09:01.176]  There it is.
[00:09:01.256 --> 00:09:08.741]  Mark of the Beast officially announced Davos Group rolls out vaccine passports to enforce global carbon taxes to restrict travel.
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.260]  I want to take the S off the end.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.980]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.179]  Now think about that.
[00:09:18.283 --> 00:09:19.524]  Let's put it back up on screen.
[00:09:19.804 --> 00:09:21.526]  I wrote that headline two minutes before I went on air.
[00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:22.287]  That's my typo.
[00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:23.188]  I'm fixing live on air.
[00:09:24.349 --> 00:09:24.969]  Blowback!
[00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:33.497]  Fully vaccinated Colin Powell dies from complications of the Wuhan Lab Globalist Bioweapon COVID-19.
[00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:45.407]  Tune in now to this pivotal broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, because Alex Jones will lay out 200 ways to peacefully bring down the New World Order dictatorship.
[00:09:45.747 --> 00:09:46.367]  Share this link.
[00:09:46.647 --> 00:09:57.392]  And you know, I am a buddy of mine who has been involved in overthrowing governments and who has been involved in major, very famous black ops.
[00:09:59.184 --> 00:10:02.585]  Involved in the preparations to overthrow Kim Jong-un, things like that.
[00:10:03.045 --> 00:10:04.165]  He's a patriot.
[00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:07.165]  He didn't send me something secret this morning at 4 a.m.
[00:10:08.346 --> 00:10:15.507]  He sent me something that's public and that they've used in other countries to overthrow dictators.
[00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:25.649]  And so coming up in the third hour today, I'm going to read all 190 plus, but I've added a few to this because this list is not as modern as it could be.
[00:10:26.704 --> 00:10:31.325]  But it is 198 methods of non-violent action.
[00:10:33.805 --> 00:10:40.726]  And this was developed by the Pentagon back when they actually followed the motto of free the oppressed, not oppress the people.
[00:10:42.727 --> 00:10:51.448]  So we're going to be going over the 198 methods, and I just said 200 because there's just a few more that I'll tell you are actually new methods of resistance.
[00:10:51.608 --> 00:10:55.269]  But we can open the phones up too for the whole show and talk about what those methods of resistance could be.
[00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:01.360]  So that's what we're going to be breaking down today.
[00:11:02.321 --> 00:11:05.922]  But at the bottom of the hour, because something this big needs to have some fanfare.
[00:11:06.662 --> 00:11:15.305]  I mean, Otto announced this 7 o'clock at night when it's already dark and have spotlights above the building and dancing girls and 21 gun salutes going off.
[00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:17.346]  I mean, maybe people go, whoa, this is important.
[00:11:17.366 --> 00:11:21.227]  Because if we don't spotlight this and say, hey, this is really big.
[00:11:23.066 --> 00:11:27.189]  Kind of like, is it important that a cockroach fell in your swimming pool and you're going to have to scoop it out later?
[00:11:27.249 --> 00:11:27.469]  No.
[00:11:27.969 --> 00:11:36.295]  But if I called you up as your neighbor and said, hey Bob, four guys just broke in your house and they're carrying out your furniture and putting it in a van, that's pretty important.
[00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:38.617]  Well, this is about a trillion times more important.
[00:11:39.037 --> 00:11:41.258]  I mean, this is hair on fire.
[00:11:41.338 --> 00:11:42.539]  This is really bad.
[00:11:44.681 --> 00:11:50.265]  They have openly announced the global government carbon tax to buy and sell and to travel.
[00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:52.006]  They say it will restrict your travel.
[00:11:53.208 --> 00:12:05.477]  And they say it is under the UN-approved worldwide vaccine passport, and it's now being officially rolled out by the entire Fortune 500 as we speak.
[00:12:07.578 --> 00:12:08.439]  Now you think about that.
[00:12:08.479 --> 00:12:14.283]  Now they didn't just release this until Thursday, but they actually produced this and said it would be ready by September.
[00:12:14.323 --> 00:12:18.546]  So it's already rolling out, and major retailers and major airlines have announced it.
[00:12:18.646 --> 00:12:23.586]   So, oh, you thought you were just getting the COVID pass, Proving you'd have the shots.
[00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:24.727]  Oh, sorry.
[00:12:25.387 --> 00:12:26.808]  It's now a carbon pass.
[00:12:26.848 --> 00:12:34.851]  Now folks, if you're a regular listener, you've heard me say this probably in the last 21 months through the show, six, seven days a week.
[00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:35.831]  How many days?
[00:12:35.872 --> 00:12:36.892]  Almost 600 days.
[00:12:36.912 --> 00:12:38.593]  It's about 600 days.
[00:12:39.073 --> 00:12:41.414]  I've been on about seven days a week and I probably say it every hour.
[00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:47.214]  So I've said this thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times.
[00:12:47.415 --> 00:12:49.716]  And again, it's not because I have a Palantir, a crystal ball.
[00:12:49.896 --> 00:12:51.918]  I'm not talking to Sauron or Gandalf or the elves.
[00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.779]  I don't have the ring of power.
[00:12:56.602 --> 00:12:57.122]  I've got this.
[00:12:58.443 --> 00:12:59.484]  He wrote a damn book.
[00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:19.375]  A year and a half ago about the whole plan, which was already in their plans, we already covered years before, but they officially say this, and they're doing this to make you poor, to control you, and make you non-essential, and they're not going to let you travel or live, and food's going to cost three times more, and fuel's going to cost double, and that's just the beginning until everything collapses, and I have them officially announcing it in the news today!
[00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:27.469]  But I'm going to show you where they say it and go over each piece of it and then the incredible lies.
[00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.580]  It says nothing tracks you and you have no privacy violations and no one has your data.
[00:13:33.956 --> 00:13:46.027]  When we take your blood, when we scan it, when it's on a QR code in a global UN database, and we're gonna add up your carbon credits and decide where you can go and what you can do if we let you and that doesn't track you.
[00:13:46.227 --> 00:13:53.173]  That's like saying, again, if you took somebody and chopped their head off with a guillotine saying, nobody laid a scratch on that person's neck.
[00:13:54.932 --> 00:14:04.678]  Or have the Dallas Cowboys running on the field with their powder baby blue helmets and the navy blue star and saying the Dallas Cowboys aren't in Dallas and don't have navy blue stars.
[00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:09.501]  I mean, it is like saying red lights aren't red, green lights aren't green.
[00:14:09.602 --> 00:14:12.964]  It is just, it's fabulous gaslighting.
[00:14:13.757 --> 00:14:15.739]  And you think, well that's dumb, that'll discredit them.
[00:14:15.819 --> 00:14:16.559]  They don't care.
[00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:18.901]  They're meant to just get you used to so many lies.
[00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:22.644]  Yeah, convicted pedophiles came to your school unannounced, and your five-year-old bounced on their erection.
[00:14:23.044 --> 00:14:23.684]  Through the pants, yeah?
[00:14:23.945 --> 00:14:24.685]  Yeah.
[00:14:24.745 --> 00:14:29.048]  And the mother takes the children and lays them on the genitals of the man while he humps them on TV.
[00:14:29.549 --> 00:14:30.850]  It's all pissing on you.
[00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.091]  It's all dominating you.
[00:14:32.947 --> 00:14:34.328]  But hey, these guys will face God.
[00:14:34.668 --> 00:14:46.378]  You look at the blowback of Colin Powell, and you know Colin Powell, I feel sorry for him, but I don't like to judge the dead, but man, I tell you, he never repented of what he did, and I tell you, he's burning in hell right now.
[00:14:46.938 --> 00:14:48.039]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:57.426]  You found it, the front lines of the fight for the human future, and the war for the third dimension and beyond.
[00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:06.264]   To the tenth dimension, beyond infinity, All right, here we are.
[00:15:10.166 --> 00:15:40.111]   Colin Powell is an absolutely wicked person who, when they couldn't sell the Iraq War, and the New York Times and others were knowingly manufacturing yellow cake from Nigeria and aluminum tubes and nuclear weapons hidden under rose bushes in southern Baghdad, They wanted to go destabilize that country further and be able to take it over.
[00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:43.593]  They'd already set up Saddam, who I'm not defending, in 1990.
[00:15:44.274 --> 00:15:45.255]  They told him to invade.
[00:15:45.295 --> 00:15:49.738]  They told him to go after Iran and the Iran-Iraq War.
[00:15:49.858 --> 00:15:51.139]  He was put in by the CIA.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.945]  And they then set him up to build their New World Order to have the image of the UN and all these countries ganged up going in and invading a country.
[00:15:59.285 --> 00:16:01.847]  Then they put sanctions on him that killed over 2 million Iraqis.
[00:16:02.768 --> 00:16:17.685]   And then along comes 2003, and instead of going after the Taliban or Al Qaeda or the globalist groups and the Carlisle Group and the Bushes that funded them and protected them, instead the United States went after Iraq again.
[00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:20.467]  And our military was put into there.
[00:16:21.427 --> 00:16:34.554]  So they could make trillions and trillions of dollars, what, $5 trillion off the Iraq War, $2.5 trillion off the Afghanistan War, designed for the big defense contractor companies to steal trillions of dollars and to base our military.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.366]  He got up there famously with the anthrax vial and said, this is being made in these mobile labs.
[00:16:41.406 --> 00:16:55.861]  And they showed a supposed photo of one of the mobile trucks that they knew from Jane's Weapons Quarterly was a very popular British truck made for 50 years that Saddam had bought hundreds of for the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s.
[00:16:57.776 --> 00:17:05.522]  That put up hydrogen balloons at 10,000 feet on a cable with cameras on them so you could direct artillery.
[00:17:06.804 --> 00:17:07.844]  In fact, it turned out U.S.
[00:17:07.884 --> 00:17:14.050]  taxpayer money paid and the CIA advised Saddam to buy those vehicles.
[00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.793]  So the CIA advised the U.S.
[00:17:17.813 --> 00:17:19.054]  taxpayer paid.
[00:17:20.882 --> 00:17:27.625]  To give money to Saddam for him to then buy those very trucks that they knew the name, the model, everything.
[00:17:29.525 --> 00:17:34.227]  Like you see Abrams tank, was that an A1 whatever?
[00:17:34.267 --> 00:17:35.888]  What variant of the B2 bomber is that?
[00:17:36.328 --> 00:17:38.029]  Or what type of aircraft carrier is that?
[00:17:38.069 --> 00:17:38.749]  What class is that?
[00:17:38.829 --> 00:17:41.210]  They know in five seconds, a weapons expert.
[00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:45.712]  And they got there and said, here's the Anthrax and they made it in these trucks.
[00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:51.461]  And then they went in there and blew the whole country up again, and you know the rest is history.
[00:17:51.822 --> 00:17:53.284]  Another million starved to death after that.
[00:17:53.645 --> 00:17:55.248]  That's what they did to an industrialized country.
[00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:56.349]  Now they're starving us to death.
[00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.471]  Now they're shutting down our countries.
[00:17:57.792 --> 00:17:59.615]  Now they're putting us under the same level of siege.
[00:18:00.236 --> 00:18:01.879]  So what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[00:18:03.208 --> 00:18:06.950]  We reap what we sow, so we have to repent before this comes down on us, but it already is.
[00:18:07.391 --> 00:18:10.613]  The same murderers that wanted to depopulate Iraq are gonna do it to us.
[00:18:11.293 --> 00:18:12.814]  They're doing it to Africa, Latin America.
[00:18:13.354 --> 00:18:20.458]  So, isn't it karmic, or you reap what you sow, that he held up a fake bioweapon, turned out it wasn't even anthrax in the vial.
[00:18:20.478 --> 00:18:24.501]  It'd be illegal to even be walking around with it for anybody.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.043]  Unless you're in a level four weapons lab at Fort Detrick.
[00:18:28.623 --> 00:18:33.529]  He holds up the so-called vial of anthrax up to kill everybody in the building, if they were to aerosolize it properly.
[00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:39.616]  And he used the lie of a biological weapon to launch a war that killed another million people total.
[00:18:42.219 --> 00:18:45.923]  And isn't it fitting that he died from a biological weapon?
[00:18:47.563 --> 00:18:58.750]  Isn't it fitting that Fauci and Gates and Peter Daszak cooked it up and ran the Wuhan lab, and we have all the documents and all the admissions, how they made COVID-19, how they told the Pentagon they were going to release it on the Chinese people.
[00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.130]  Pentagon said, that'll start a war.
[00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:00.851]  Do not do that.
[00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:03.509]  That was only five years ago.
[00:19:03.509 --> 00:19:08.990]   And they cooked it up and finally did release it, so they had plausible deniability to say,
[00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:14.471]   "Oh, it came from a wet market, a wild animal market, "or it accidentally got out."
[00:19:14.471 --> 00:19:17.529]   No, they released it on purpose, and it's in Operation Lockstep.
[00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:26.811]   And then that very weapon killed the globalist puppet who helped serve the same system
[00:19:26.811 --> 00:19:29.190]  and lied about biological weapons himself.
[00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:30.535]  That is extremely fitting.
[00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:31.796]  Am I happy he's dead?
[00:19:31.896 --> 00:19:32.116]  No.
[00:19:32.216 --> 00:19:44.723]  But I'm happy he can't commit more evil in his lifetime against humanity because he is the accomplice to mass murder and mass death and is a war criminal of biblical proportions along with Henry Kissinger and the rest of them.
[00:19:46.264 --> 00:19:49.686]  Bill Clinton's fighting for his life right now in a hospital with flesh-eating bacteria.
[00:19:51.428 --> 00:19:53.390]  They will all face their makers.
[00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:56.792]  Hillary looks real scared walking out of there.
[00:19:56.992 --> 00:20:03.498]  Not because she cares about Bill, but because she's got the fires of hell lapping at her pedophile-defending ass.
[00:20:03.758 --> 00:20:10.758]  her war-mongering, America-hating, God-hating ass.
[00:20:10.758 --> 00:20:14.037]  But here's the bigger story.
[00:20:14.037 --> 00:20:24.038]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:20:16.288 --> 00:20:18.410]  He took the Pfizer shot.
[00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.130]  That's on the news.
[00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:19.931]  He bragged about it.
[00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:29.757]  And just like the John Hopkins statistics and the UK statistics show, you're twice as likely to die of COVID if you take any of those vaccines that aren't vaccines.
[00:20:30.538 --> 00:20:36.503]  And you're way more likely to end up in the hospital or dead, and it's the same in every major country in the world that has taken those.
[00:20:37.384 --> 00:20:39.105]  But countries that haven't taken them, no problems.
[00:20:40.066 --> 00:20:40.766]  It's over for them.
[00:20:43.188 --> 00:20:45.050]  So, a casualty of his own evil.
[00:20:46.471 --> 00:20:50.855]  Those that live by the biological weapon sword die by the biological weapon sword.
[00:20:53.117 --> 00:20:58.902]  Here is him setting the stage to go back and kill millions more in Iraq.
[00:21:01.965 --> 00:21:12.514]  You will recall that it took UNSCOM four long and frustrating years to pry, to pry an admission out of Iraq that it had biological weapons.
[00:21:13.495 --> 00:21:20.859]   Second, when Iraq finally admitted Having these weapons in 1995, the quantities were vast.
[00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:24.581]  Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax.
[00:21:24.642 --> 00:21:26.703]  A little bit about this amount.
[00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:28.584]  This is just about the amount of a teaspoon.
[00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:36.130]  Less than a teaspoonful of dry anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of 2001.
[00:21:37.891 --> 00:21:50.642]  This forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope.
[00:21:51.442 --> 00:21:56.086]  Iraq declared 8,500 liters of anthrax.
[00:21:56.847 --> 00:22:12.898]   But UNSCOM estimates that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters if concentrated into this dry form This amount would be enough to fill tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons.
[00:22:13.518 --> 00:22:21.682]  And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoonful of this deadly material.
[00:22:22.382 --> 00:22:23.483]  And that is my third point.
[00:22:24.083 --> 00:22:24.784]  And it is key.
[00:22:25.384 --> 00:22:30.006]  The Iraqis... And he goes on to show the trucks and tell all the lies.
[00:22:30.146 --> 00:22:33.128]  Well, he got killed by a real bio weapon.
[00:22:33.228 --> 00:22:35.109]  It wasn't Saddam Hussein cooking up anthrax.
[00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:51.837]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it was the people in charge of minions like Colin Powell that were cooking up COVID-19 that they then released on the world to kill our old people and to kill people that have pre-existing conditions and depopulate.
[00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:58.720]  And now the vaccine itself is not a vaccine, it's killing even more people than that, and it's all confirmed, and it's all on record.
[00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:09.555]  They say you're not speak ill of the dead, but I think when you're talking about the likes of Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler or Colin Powell or Bill Clinton, I'll just say this.
[00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:11.676]  Thanks to Jesus, vengeance is yours.
[00:23:12.577 --> 00:23:16.299]  Colin Powell is now where he wanted to be, away from God.
[00:23:16.679 --> 00:23:18.020]  You can bet your bottom dollar.
[00:23:18.681 --> 00:23:27.446]  All right, I have a few more comments about the globalists that died early this morning of complications, they tell us, from COVID-19.
[00:23:29.855 --> 00:23:30.976]  Who knows if that's even true.
[00:23:31.416 --> 00:23:34.178]  They lie so much, but they want to scare you and say, see, it's real.
[00:23:34.198 --> 00:23:35.219]  You better go out, get your shot.
[00:23:35.239 --> 00:23:38.361]  They're actually on the news saying you better get your shot.
[00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:39.001]  Just type it in.
[00:23:40.162 --> 00:23:42.924]  Americans encouraged to take their COVID vaccine.
[00:23:44.265 --> 00:23:46.446]  Holdouts encouraged after Colin Powell died.
[00:23:47.227 --> 00:23:49.428]  And then they don't point out he was quote, fully vaccinated.
[00:23:49.728 --> 00:23:52.210]  You can pull up the articles, him out there pushing it six months ago.
[00:23:53.911 --> 00:23:57.854]  Just like so many other prominent people take the shot and end up dead.
[00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:03.353]  Don't think there'll be a VAERS report about him, though.
[00:24:03.653 --> 00:24:06.394]  So he died of COVID, supposedly, but it didn't protect him.
[00:24:06.414 --> 00:24:07.135]  And here are the headlines.
[00:24:07.455 --> 00:24:08.595]  Colin Powell's death.
[00:24:09.616 --> 00:24:12.617]  Former Secretary of State dies from COVID complications at age 84.
[00:24:14.238 --> 00:24:22.542]  And you don't see anywhere in ABC, NBC, the London Independent, the BBC, the New York Times, nowhere do they say he was fully vaccinated.
[00:24:22.562 --> 00:24:23.522]  You can pull that up and look it up.
[00:24:23.782 --> 00:24:24.983]  We have links to it on InfoWars.com.
[00:24:26.943 --> 00:24:31.927]  CBS News, Colin Powell, first Black Secretary of State, dies at 84 from complications of COVID-19.
[00:24:31.947 --> 00:24:34.289]  Nowhere does it say he was fully vaccinated.
[00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.492]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell dies from COVID complications.
[00:24:37.572 --> 00:24:38.233]  NBC News.
[00:24:42.536 --> 00:24:43.117]  And there it is.
[00:24:43.217 --> 00:24:46.119]  Fully vaccinated Colin Powell dies from COVID complications.
[00:24:46.179 --> 00:24:51.164]  And we've got links to where he bragged about being fully injected in the article.
[00:24:52.188 --> 00:24:53.149]  Isn't that the news?
[00:24:53.329 --> 00:24:54.169]  Fully vaccinated?
[00:24:54.569 --> 00:24:55.630]  Gateway Pundit got it right.
[00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.211]  Colin Powell dies at 84 from COVID complications.
[00:24:58.611 --> 00:24:59.612]  He was fully vaccinated.
[00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:03.394]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:25:04.574 --> 00:25:06.535]  Very, very interesting.
[00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:08.276]  Okay, I'm gonna hit the big news now.
[00:25:10.497 --> 00:25:15.860]  The supermassive news, and I want to put on screen a Kit Daniels article that he wrote today about it.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.583]  It's very, very important to put that headline up on screen.
[00:25:20.603 --> 00:25:21.043]  There it is.
[00:25:25.006 --> 00:25:41.499]  It's such a big deal, and again, I don't want, you see, when I see Joe Rogan really awake fighting the New World Order now, or Tucker Carlson really awake fighting it, I don't go, hey, those guys have horned in on my territory, or, oh man, they're getting so popular, tell them the truth.
[00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:54.490]  I think, thank God we've come this far, that the most popular people in the country, and in the world, really, I mean, Tucker's loved around the world, so is Joe, that they both say, man, you were right, you helped wake me up, thank you.
[00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:55.966]  I mean...
[00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.310]  The left makes a big deal about it.
[00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.251]  They get so jealous of it.
[00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:02.812]  They have CNN pieces and MSNBC pieces and Media Matters pieces.
[00:26:02.832 --> 00:26:07.253]  I had a new one a few days ago saying it's just horrible that Joe Rogan talks to Alex Jones and their friends.
[00:26:07.313 --> 00:26:10.074]  It's horrible that Tucker Carlson says nice things about Alex Jones.
[00:26:10.374 --> 00:26:13.074]  We've got to boycott him or take him off the air because he's not allowed to.
[00:26:13.414 --> 00:26:23.717]  Because if I get defended as the main vanguard fighting this, well then they can't demonize everybody else that does it and scare people away from the truth.
[00:26:24.037 --> 00:26:25.378]  They're going to fail in that fear.
[00:26:26.158 --> 00:26:28.139]  Because we should celebrate people that tell the truth.
[00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:45.547]  So I'm very, very excited to see how awake Rogan is, how hyper-awake Tucker is, because I see Tucker even being more nuanced and understanding things that I didn't even understand.
[00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:48.508]  I mean, I'm learning stuff from Tucker Carlson.
[00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:55.873]  I don't know a lot of stuff from Joe when I have time to watch his program and tune in on subjects I'm not, you know, really up on.
[00:26:55.893 --> 00:27:04.277]  But when it comes to geopolitics, the New World Order, and the globalists, the drug companies, and their master plan, I've got the big, you know, 35,000-foot view of it.
[00:27:05.717 --> 00:27:07.178]  So that's a great thing.
[00:27:07.398 --> 00:27:12.460]  And we can't get mad at Dave Chappelle as he begins to wake up that he hasn't come super far yet.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.441]  Because remember, we were once asleep.
[00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:15.982]  We were once just waking up.
[00:27:16.282 --> 00:27:18.343]  We were once babies in this as well.
[00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:21.572]  But Joe is no baby in this.
[00:27:21.933 --> 00:27:23.634]  And he wasn't 20 plus years ago when I knew him.
[00:27:24.474 --> 00:27:28.417]  He just chose not to believe this because it was too frustrating and too out of control.
[00:27:29.578 --> 00:27:32.100]  But as he saw things get worse and get bad, he said, I apologize.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.581]  I needed to set it on air.
[00:27:34.641 --> 00:27:38.024]  I needed to really come to grips with the fact that the world really is this bad.
[00:27:38.044 --> 00:27:38.804]  And I didn't want to admit it.
[00:27:38.824 --> 00:27:39.845]  I just wanted to enjoy my life.
[00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:41.366]  And it looks like I can't do that.
[00:27:41.386 --> 00:27:42.767]  I'm going to have to fight him or I won't have a life.
[00:27:43.167 --> 00:27:45.269]  And that's the same process we all go through.
[00:27:46.445 --> 00:27:47.626]  I mean, I want to go watch movies.
[00:27:48.347 --> 00:27:49.287]  I want to go screw around.
[00:27:49.327 --> 00:27:50.048]  I want to go hunting.
[00:27:50.148 --> 00:27:50.849]  I want to go fishing.
[00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:57.254]  I want to go drive around the country and look at the mountains and look at the oceans and go deep-sea fishing.
[00:27:58.014 --> 00:28:02.998]  I don't want to be doing this, but I have to because we will be slaves if we don't.
[00:28:03.078 --> 00:28:05.200]  In fact, now it's not, oh, the slavery's coming.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:05.701]  It's here.
[00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:07.462]  And it's getting worse by the minute.
[00:28:07.902 --> 00:28:12.026]  So I'll actually hit this top story next segment because I want to just have a whole segment to really drill into this.
[00:28:13.524 --> 00:28:23.313]  Let's just put that headline back up from Kit Daniels, and then it's got a 20-minute piece, you know, I did live on air last night, laying all this out.
[00:28:23.373 --> 00:28:27.296]  But Davos Group pushes vaccine passports to enforce global carbon taxes.
[00:28:27.336 --> 00:28:34.703]  Now, imagine the magnitude of that, and realize what that signifies.
[00:28:36.745 --> 00:28:37.626]  What does that signify?
[00:28:38.607 --> 00:28:41.711]  A global consortium of corporations set up the UN.
[00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:47.337]  The UN three months ago put out a global standardization for a world vaccine passport.
[00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:51.922]  The Davos Group is the one that submitted it.
[00:28:52.443 --> 00:28:55.386]  The corporations are the ones that are now going to implement it and enforce it on us.
[00:28:56.607 --> 00:29:04.093]  And it tracks you and taxes you and decides where you can go and what you can do and will then selectively be used to shut down all their competition.
[00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:09.897]  It won't just cost $150 trillion in the next decade as the UN officially released a report last week.
[00:29:10.137 --> 00:29:12.479]  It's not just $150 trillion in taxes on you.
[00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:19.744]  It's not just the global banks giving themselves that money to buy up more infrastructure and totally control our lives.
[00:29:20.305 --> 00:29:24.368]  It's designed to declare everything else non-essential and cut resources off to you.
[00:29:24.548 --> 00:29:25.689]  That's called siege.
[00:29:28.174 --> 00:29:42.383]  And so, yeah, it was theoretical, and it's something Enron came up with in the early 90s, and it's something that they adopted by the late 1990s as global policy, and now we're here in 2021, and they're doing it and saying it's meant to depopulate the third world.
[00:29:43.103 --> 00:29:48.867]  But the survivors of the third world will then be used as a weapon to invade and take over the West under UN direction.
[00:29:51.929 --> 00:29:55.211]  So that's the big 35,000 foot view.
[00:29:55.251 --> 00:29:57.092]  That's the big boil down.
[00:29:57.112 --> 00:29:59.573]  When I come back, I'm gonna drill into all this.
[00:30:01.274 --> 00:30:01.775]  Separately.
[00:30:04.096 --> 00:30:06.077]  My friends, looking for my DNA Force Plus.
[00:30:07.138 --> 00:30:11.220]  It was on my desk and now it has been removed from my desk.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.042]  Will someone please bring me a bottle of DNA Force Plus?
[00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:16.443]  NX2 has been taken off my counter.
[00:30:17.103 --> 00:30:18.024]  Will someone please?
[00:30:19.428 --> 00:30:20.169]  Please find it for me.
[00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:20.971]  Oh, there it is.
[00:30:21.051 --> 00:30:21.472]  I found it.
[00:30:21.532 --> 00:30:21.912]  My fault.
[00:30:22.433 --> 00:30:22.774]  Okay.
[00:30:23.094 --> 00:30:24.978]  So, you see these?
[00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:29.579]  This is basically sold out green fibers from the very best.
[00:30:29.579 --> 00:30:35.338]  Wheatgrass and the rest of it concentrated.
[00:30:35.338 --> 00:30:38.018]  But DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[00:30:38.018 --> 00:30:44.219]   It's 40% off and I told you today would be the day that the sale ends because I've just been too busy
[00:30:44.219 --> 00:30:46.538]  working and covering news to come up with a new sale.
[00:30:46.538 --> 00:30:51.258]   And we're almost sold out of so many products, I don't even know what the new sale's gonna be other than.
[00:30:51.258 --> 00:30:52.938]  Ultimate Turmeric Formula's amazing.
[00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:53.319]  People love it.
[00:30:53.339 --> 00:30:55.040]  It's been sold out for four or five months.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:02.544]  It's the highest level of curcuminoids available and that will soon be available in the next few days for sale and will be discounted again.
[00:31:02.564 --> 00:31:07.287]  So we're very excited that finally came back in because we won't cut the quality of the turmeric concentrate.
[00:31:07.687 --> 00:31:09.008]  And so it's been very, very hard to get it.
[00:31:10.288 --> 00:31:12.430]  And it's just super frustrating.
[00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:17.935]  At some point, we may just say, super high-grade, 95% concentrates not available.
[00:31:18.435 --> 00:31:21.017]  So now we've got this new system that's 75.
[00:31:21.057 --> 00:31:21.998]  I don't know what it's going to be.
[00:31:22.018 --> 00:31:23.599]  We're having to look around just in case.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.983]  But it won't be called Body's Ultimate Turmeric anymore if it's not that quality.
[00:31:28.203 --> 00:31:30.405]  We'll call it something new and tell you it's not as good as the old one.
[00:31:30.425 --> 00:31:31.126]  We just can't get it.
[00:31:31.906 --> 00:31:32.867]  It's being honest with people.
[00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:43.675]  But we do have the original bodies, the truck arrived, well it actually arrives today, they told me it's arriving today, and so we'll be able to start selling it tomorrow.
[00:31:44.756 --> 00:31:52.101]  It'll be discounted, but right now, the big mega blowout sale, the emergency supply chain breakdown sale, let me give you the actual name of it.
[00:31:54.883 --> 00:31:55.624]  Going from memory here.
[00:31:56.559 --> 00:32:02.585]  InfoWars Emergency Supply Chain Breakdown Sale, only hours left to save up to 50% off.

[00:32:27.595 --> 00:32:32.116]  It's all at infowarstore.com and a bunch of other sales will end today.
[00:32:32.136 --> 00:32:34.677]  And it keeps us on air and they're amazing products.
[00:32:34.717 --> 00:32:40.118]  So check it out, get a t-shirt while you're at it, get some books, get some films, get your storable foods while you still can as well.
[00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:41.299]  Major supply chain breakdowns.
[00:32:42.059 --> 00:32:44.039]  My friends, you live to see it.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:33:00.049]   In the month of October, in the year 2021, year of our Lord, Revelation was fulfilled yet again with the establishment of a private corporate world government.
[00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:06.972]  Revelation says the world government will be run by merchants and ten kings and three super-regions.
[00:33:07.973 --> 00:33:17.817]  And the UN has divided the world into three super-regions with ten sub-sectors and is run by the corporate leaders, by the businessmen, by the traders.
[00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:23.871]  Now, either it's real, and it's spiritual, and it's manifesting, or they're using it as a blueprint of control.
[00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:29.012]  They're probably delusional and believe it's just a blueprint of control, but nevertheless, it's happened.
[00:33:29.552 --> 00:33:38.973]  Or is it an ancestral memory of this happening on this planet, previous with another Atlantean civilization destroyed, or on another planet?
[00:33:40.114 --> 00:33:42.274]  I'm just theoretically putting out what's happening here.
[00:33:43.534 --> 00:33:54.416]   Or people just came up with this thousands of years ago, magically, and warned it was coming, And entities from space came and warned them and said, you need to stop this and watch out when it happens, because this is the main danger.
[00:33:54.696 --> 00:33:58.979]  This is how this fallen creature on this planet is going to try to take you over.
[00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:00.580]  And it's going to want your children.
[00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:04.462]  And it's going to want to kill your children.
[00:34:06.324 --> 00:34:11.167]  Wow, that must have been some good stuff that John the Revelator was smoking on the Isle of Patmos.
[00:34:13.046 --> 00:34:20.017]  Yes, and they're finding all over the world sunken cities in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean and in the Caribbean.
[00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.142]  Some structures bigger than the pyramids.
[00:34:26.516 --> 00:34:33.038]  Again, everything Plato basically said has now been dug up or found, but Atlantis, and he wrote his non-fiction book, The Republic, and it's all in there.
[00:34:33.338 --> 00:34:34.959]  He wrote other books about Atlantis.
[00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:40.761]  Energy system, flying machines, giant metal machines that men stepped into.
[00:34:41.241 --> 00:34:42.061]  Pretty wild stuff!
[00:34:42.461 --> 00:34:44.462]  Yeah, it wasn't the Japanese who came up with transformers.
[00:34:45.062 --> 00:34:51.904]  So, you can try to figure out what this is, but the point is, the people running things know, and they want you dead.
[00:34:52.204 --> 00:34:53.725]  That's the directive they've been given.
[00:34:55.191 --> 00:35:02.874]  Now, to do that, they need to get you all signed up with a little digital minder that is a high-tech, trillion-dollar-designed total.
[00:35:02.994 --> 00:35:14.598]  A trillion dollars of money or more has gone into these phones that tracks where you are, where you go, what you do, that surveils you, that listens to you, that reads what you write, that sends you ads off of what you say to your wife or husband.
[00:35:15.098 --> 00:35:15.939]  It's all admitted now.
[00:35:15.999 --> 00:35:17.719]  They give it to you, deny it's happening.
[00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:19.740]  Now that you're addicted, they admit it's all happening.
[00:35:21.485 --> 00:35:24.567]  And now over the phone, it's your chip you carry in your hand.
[00:35:25.468 --> 00:35:28.309]  Swab said soon it'll be under your skin.
[00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.791]  That'll just be the new upgrade, the new requirement.
[00:35:31.051 --> 00:35:36.875]  He said first it'll be your phone, then it'll be sewn into your clothing, and then you'll have to have it under the skin under UN law.
[00:35:37.155 --> 00:35:42.458]  So they went to the UN, got a global COVID passport prepared, already had it previously prepared under another name.
[00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:44.540]  They roll it out three months ago.
[00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:51.912]  And then Debo's group puts out a video last week saying, oh, we're going to blood test you to travel.
[00:35:51.932 --> 00:35:52.832]  Everybody focused on that.
[00:35:52.872 --> 00:35:59.515]  But the other announcements were there's going to be a carbon tax that tracks what you buy, where you go, what you do with a carbon ration.
[00:36:00.215 --> 00:36:06.357]  And it'll decide when you can go somewhere, when you can fly on a plane, when you can leave your town, when you can get in a car.
[00:36:06.977 --> 00:36:08.098]  You won't just be taxed.
[00:36:08.218 --> 00:36:10.859]  It will decide if you're allowed to even move.
[00:36:10.899 --> 00:36:14.340]  Remember Plandopolis put up by the Rockefeller Foundation, the U.N.? ?
[00:36:16.175 --> 00:36:35.118]  For elementary students in the United Kingdom, 5th and 6th graders, and it said, oh, your smartphone tells you when you can go outside, your smartphone tells you when you can go to the store, your smartphone tells you what type of job you'll have, and your carbon allotment under the UN Global Food Council.
[00:36:36.613 --> 00:36:45.655]  They didn't just put out these cartoons for 5th and 6th graders in the UK, similar ones in Germany, put out by the UN, where it says, when you're 14, you will take a Muslim husband.
[00:36:45.975 --> 00:36:48.036]  Muslim husbands are better than German husbands.
[00:36:48.276 --> 00:36:49.496]  These are real videos, I can blame them for you.
[00:36:50.236 --> 00:36:53.137]  That's just the type of stuff they put on there.
[00:36:53.517 --> 00:37:06.100]  So, this is what they show children, this is what they show 10-year-olds, this is what they show 9-year-olds, and now it's here.
[00:37:07.867 --> 00:37:08.908]  And so here's the headline.
[00:37:08.968 --> 00:37:15.473]  Mark of the Beast officially announced Davos Group rolls out vaccine passports to enforce global carbon taxes to restrict travel.
[00:37:15.513 --> 00:37:17.254]  And then what's the final piece tied to that?
[00:37:17.595 --> 00:37:27.542]  I said it'll be a vaccine passport, told you this years ago, with, before they rolled out COVID, then they'll call it a carbon tax pass connected to that.
[00:37:27.923 --> 00:37:33.107]  And then the final thing, your social credit score, which again is the beginning of the end.
[00:37:34.502 --> 00:37:37.005]  And that's the system, and that's the plan, and they're rolling it out.
[00:37:37.245 --> 00:37:38.947]  And do you hear any of this from Rand Paul?
[00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:41.689]  Do you hear any of this from Tom Cotton?
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.241]  Ted Cruz, because they're all as smart as I am, or smarter.
[00:37:47.261 --> 00:37:48.101]  They all know this.
[00:37:48.822 --> 00:37:53.184]  But for some reason, Josh Hawley, all of them, just pay lip service to all this.
[00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:55.125]  They don't tell you, hey, world government's here.
[00:37:55.445 --> 00:37:56.645]  Hey, the UN ran this.
[00:37:56.725 --> 00:37:58.026]  They released the bioweapon.
[00:37:58.346 --> 00:37:59.667]  They're taking control of the US.
[00:37:59.687 --> 00:38:08.171]  The big corporations are enforcing this and rolling this out through the airlines, through the businesses, to make you do this, to have a job, or go to the hospital, or get on a plane.
[00:38:08.831 --> 00:38:15.615]  And then they're going to phase it right down to your daily life, where if you don't follow all the social credit score rules they have, they're going to demote you.
[00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:22.138]  The Chinese model, guys, pull up the Chinese model, is from like 1,400, I think.
[00:38:22.158 --> 00:38:23.579]  I forget the actual number.
[00:38:23.919 --> 00:38:25.720]  And then, you know, that's the highest score you can get.
[00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:30.203]  And AI's watching you, and cameras are watching you, and special tattletales are watching you.
[00:38:30.383 --> 00:38:35.846]  They're able to go in, no judge, no jury, and just lower your credit score, and suddenly things cost you more.
[00:38:37.557 --> 00:38:40.159]  Yeah, so $850 is the maximum.
[00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.943]  And everybody starts out below that.
[00:38:49.965 --> 00:38:51.026]  And then it just goes from there.
[00:38:52.287 --> 00:38:54.008]  And it's tied into everything.
[00:38:54.028 --> 00:38:54.829]  And it's already here.
[00:38:54.889 --> 00:38:55.869]  And this is the plan.
[00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.211]  But first, they've got to bankrupt the world economy.
[00:38:58.331 --> 00:38:59.992]  First, they've got to destroy the old to bring in the new.
[00:39:00.212 --> 00:39:12.572]   And they've got to use all the devaluation for them to buy up everything So that when everything shuts down, they own the farms, the ranches, the auto parts stores, the machine shops, the supplement factories, everything.
[00:39:13.153 --> 00:39:16.294]  The tile factories, the flooring factories, the light bulb factories.
[00:39:16.615 --> 00:39:22.238]  They're going around buying everything globally for five times what it's worth in many cases and shutting it down.
[00:39:22.558 --> 00:39:23.199]  Closing them.
[00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:26.721]  Not so their established companies make more money.
[00:39:26.901 --> 00:39:27.561]  Oh, that's part of it.
[00:39:27.601 --> 00:39:28.782]  Vertical integration.
[00:39:29.343 --> 00:39:30.303]  Vertical consolidation.
[00:39:31.264 --> 00:39:31.384]  No.
[00:39:32.987 --> 00:39:42.991]  It's because they don't want you to have a job or know how to have a job or know how to do machining or know how to restart communities because they're going to collapse everything and then cut off the food and start mass starvation.
[00:39:43.011 --> 00:39:46.672]  Now, I've been telling you this every hour of every show for 20 plus years.
[00:39:46.912 --> 00:39:47.392]  Now it's here.
[00:39:47.772 --> 00:39:49.053]  And here's some of the headlines today.
[00:39:49.713 --> 00:39:51.494]  Hashtag Empty Shelves Trends.
[00:39:52.574 --> 00:40:00.937]  Hashtag Empty Shelves Joe Trends dominates Twitter as ships back up the ports and Biden administration blames Trump.
[00:40:01.906 --> 00:40:02.446]  Here's another one.
[00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:06.568]  Supermarkets in Germany can now block entry to the unvaccinated.
[00:40:06.608 --> 00:40:07.548]  And they're saying they are.
[00:40:07.848 --> 00:40:09.689]  This is out of the locals.de.
[00:40:10.789 --> 00:40:11.609]  Can't buy or sell.
[00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.130]  First, it's if you don't have the shot.
[00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.451]  Then it's if you have the wrong political views.
[00:40:16.851 --> 00:40:17.611]  They're already announcing that.
[00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:18.131]  U.S.
[00:40:18.171 --> 00:40:19.132]  Treasury Deputy Sec.
[00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:23.833]  warns unvaccinated Americans that shortages will continue until everyone is jabbed.
[00:40:23.913 --> 00:40:24.774]  Oh, and there's more jabs.
[00:40:25.414 --> 00:40:28.555]  UK's Chicken King warns the era of cheap food is over.
[00:40:29.335 --> 00:40:31.116]  Remember what CNN said last week?
[00:40:31.136 --> 00:40:32.356]  They said the before time.
[00:40:32.917 --> 00:40:34.838]  They said COVID's teaching us to have less.
[00:40:34.978 --> 00:40:38.219]  It's good because they're teaching you to be poor, to control you.
[00:40:38.499 --> 00:40:44.642]  But they're going to be richer and more powerful than ever and test all their new biologicals on you to give themselves cures of diseases.
[00:40:44.922 --> 00:40:45.823]  You just get to die.
[00:40:48.184 --> 00:40:49.705]  And meanwhile, it's official.
[00:40:50.885 --> 00:40:58.409]  The Navy now to separate unvaccinated as sexual predators and criminals on a database, making it criminal in your social credit score if you don't take the deadly shot.
[00:41:00.421 --> 00:41:01.182]  And then it gets worse.
[00:41:01.262 --> 00:41:02.463]  We now know what FEMA's doing.
[00:41:02.943 --> 00:41:08.667]  A hundred plus billion dollars left over from all the spending last year to shore up hospitals that were going to be hit by millions of dying.
[00:41:08.988 --> 00:41:10.309]  Fifteen days to flatten the curve.
[00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.693]  Now the hospital groups are firing all these nurses to trigger the emergency FEMA money.
[00:41:17.014 --> 00:41:21.278]  Bring in FEMA operatives who are not inoculated, who are not injected with the frankenshot.
[00:41:21.318 --> 00:41:21.978]  They don't have to be.
[00:41:21.998 --> 00:41:23.880]  It wasn't about that.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:32.868]  It was about getting rid of the regular employees to trigger the emergency to federalize medicine and then bring in the $100 billion to the medical groups who help write the regulations.
[00:41:35.629 --> 00:41:40.491]  Biden's FEMA has taken full control of America's healthcare, and it's about to get worse.
[00:41:40.591 --> 00:41:42.411]  That's yesterday's full show.
[00:41:43.072 --> 00:41:44.452]  So it ain't coming, it's here.
[00:41:44.652 --> 00:41:49.114]  The good part is, I don't have to sit here and tell you it's coming anymore and show you documents like I used to.
[00:41:49.294 --> 00:41:50.414]  You're just gonna live it now.
[00:41:52.635 --> 00:42:00.478]  And let me just show you from the actual scans, you know, screenshots of the video, the little Minute 44 Davos video they just put out last Thursday.
[00:42:01.638 --> 00:42:01.978]  Here it is.
[00:42:02.038 --> 00:42:04.299]  COVID pass plans to launch in September.
[00:42:06.892 --> 00:42:12.615]  This app could help revive global travel and large events during the pandemic when they're the ones that triggered it and did the lockdown.
[00:42:12.835 --> 00:42:13.675]  See, they hold you hostage.
[00:42:14.556 --> 00:42:17.938]  And as you get deeper in here, they say, oh, yeah, we're going to take your blood.
[00:42:17.978 --> 00:42:19.619]  Yeah, we have total privacy.
[00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:20.659]  It's the opposite of that.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.680]  We scan everything you do.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.140]  We track you.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.702]  And they say, yeah, we're going to have carbon taxes tied to it.
[00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:27.022]  And it's already being implemented.
[00:42:27.282 --> 00:42:28.763]  And it'll also help cut travel.
[00:42:29.143 --> 00:42:34.006]  It commits to mandatory carbon offsetting for each of its passengers through the app.
[00:42:35.439 --> 00:42:39.684]  Oh, to preserve environmental benefits of reduced air travel during the crisis.
[00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:41.310]  Oh my gosh!
[00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:46.933]  We're going to cut air travel by charging you more to save the Earth, just like during the lockdown, it already happened.
[00:42:46.953 --> 00:42:50.976]  So this is the new carbon lockdown, which they said they would do two years ago.
[00:42:51.536 --> 00:42:52.177]  See how it works?
[00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:57.000]  Being put under the leftist, global, transhumanist, post-human dictatorship.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.121]  You're now in the Mark of the Beast New World Order.
[00:42:59.381 --> 00:43:08.127]  All right, David Green put out a piece with John Bowne that we're going to play here in a moment that deals with the COVID death cover-up fiasco.
[00:43:10.066 --> 00:43:17.072]  And it's an important report, and I'm not critiquing it when I say this, I'm just saying Cuomo and the rest of these people are just mid-level minions.
[00:43:17.112 --> 00:43:20.915]  The scumbag New Jersey governor, the rest of them are just scumbag minions.
[00:43:21.356 --> 00:43:22.056]  So is Biden.
[00:43:22.096 --> 00:43:28.162]  We need to be talking about Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the people up above that.
[00:43:28.202 --> 00:43:29.443]  That's who launched this attack.
[00:43:29.883 --> 00:43:31.504]  Colin Powell was a nobody to these people.
[00:43:31.765 --> 00:43:32.725]  He died in blowback.
[00:43:33.266 --> 00:43:35.248]  Obviously he didn't get the memo to not take the deadly vaccine.
[00:43:35.288 --> 00:43:36.569]  He took the deadly vaccine and died.
[00:43:37.995 --> 00:43:38.736]  So here's the report.
[00:43:38.776 --> 00:43:39.538]  It's an important report.
[00:43:39.578 --> 00:43:42.023]  It's a good report, but it's only one level of it.
[00:43:42.083 --> 00:43:42.463]  Here it is.
[00:43:45.439 --> 00:43:50.663]  As the seats of power shift in the governor's seats in New York and New Jersey.
[00:43:50.983 --> 00:43:53.605]  I've got seven years, four months, and one day and I am gone.
[00:43:54.045 --> 00:43:57.307]  I'm sending my daughter to school out of state with orders never to return.
[00:43:57.727 --> 00:44:00.429]  This state is too expensive and you're making it worse.
[00:44:00.469 --> 00:44:01.110]  I got the point.
[00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:08.295]  The truth behind the bureaucratic mass deaths in nursing homes and veterans hospitals bubbles to the surface.
[00:44:09.278 --> 00:44:11.039]  Well, was it a Cuomo cover-up?
[00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:23.485]  That is a burning question today after a top Cuomo aide appears to admit that the governor's office intentionally delayed releasing COVID death numbers at nursing homes to state legislators because they were worried a federal investigation was underway.
[00:44:24.065 --> 00:44:27.967]  An attorney representing victims' families says the numbers show the problem.
[00:44:28.027 --> 00:44:35.791]  At first, just 9,000 deaths linked to nursing homes and long-term care facilities were reported, when the state attorney general says the real number was 15,000.
[00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:38.572]  This is just one big cover-up.
[00:44:38.732 --> 00:44:50.695]  Cuomo's troubles escalated when his chief of staff admitted the state withheld nursing home fatality numbers from the legislature because Cuomo's staff worried they'd be used against us by the Trump White House.
[00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:55.997]  Families presented Governor Hochul with a booklet filled with photos of many seniors who died.
[00:44:56.557 --> 00:45:03.179]  And they're demanding the creation of a victim's compensation fund for nursing home COVID victims and the families they left behind.
[00:45:03.419 --> 00:45:14.232]  As New York totalitarian governor Kathy Hochul took over the reins, she piled on another 12,000 unreported deaths to the New York COVID death toll.
[00:45:14.552 --> 00:45:20.519]  And now, after 19 long months, Hochul, the self-proclaimed COVID messiah.
[00:45:20.799 --> 00:45:22.900]  He may then come up with a vaccine.
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.961]  That is from God to us.
[00:45:25.482 --> 00:45:30.584]  Is finally apologizing for Cuomo's mass death toll in nursing homes.
[00:45:31.005 --> 00:45:36.247]  A massacre Hochul oversaw as well when she was lieutenant governor.
[00:45:36.628 --> 00:45:54.307]   According to the New York Post, over the summer, A 242-page report by the New York State Bar Association quietly revealed that Cuomo's directive for New York nursing homes to admit COVID-19 patients increased the death toll among residents.
[00:45:54.787 --> 00:45:58.630]  And Cuomo's claims otherwise have been disproven.
[00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:16.144]  New York State Bar Association's Task Force on Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care also blasts Cuomo for not reversing the Department of Health's unreasonable mandate sooner than he did, saying it remained in effect weeks longer than necessary.
[00:46:16.504 --> 00:46:21.208]  Meanwhile, in New Jersey, a federal investigation is ramping up.
[00:46:21.728 --> 00:46:34.114]  In New Jersey, the federal investigation appears to be only focused on Paramus and Menlo Park, not the other long-term care facilities where nearly 8,000 residents and dozens of staff members lost their lives.
[00:46:34.414 --> 00:46:41.306]   If there's a federal investigation going on on something, you can assume up front that we're not going to have any
[00:46:41.306 --> 00:46:42.246]  commentary.
[00:46:42.246 --> 00:46:46.887]   It's estimated around 192 residents fatally contracted the coronavirus in
[00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:49.766]  the state's Menlo Park and Paramus Veterans Homes.
[00:46:49.766 --> 00:46:53.047]   Loved ones have said at one point the facilities did not have staff or
[00:46:53.047 --> 00:46:56.646]   patients wearing masks and COVID positive residents were allowed to roam
[00:46:56.646 --> 00:47:03.925]   the hallways. You're not taking proper precautions so they are just letting it spread rampantly
[00:47:03.925 --> 00:47:06.967]  throughout that building.
[00:47:05.391 --> 00:47:19.607]  New Jersey Governor Murphy again offered apologies and praise for the troops as a deflection for his own responsibility in the deaths of those that gave their lives defending the United States.
[00:47:20.248 --> 00:47:34.252]  You know the system is truly broken when after killing the patriarchs, matriarchs, and heroes within American families with their psychotic bureaucracy, the best we can hope for is an apology.
[00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:38.333]  On behalf of John Bowne, this is Darren McBreen reporting.
[00:47:39.514 --> 00:47:41.754]  Alright folks, we're gonna come back with solutions.
[00:47:41.775 --> 00:47:43.775]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[00:47:43.775 --> 00:47:56.775]  [Music]
[00:47:56.775 --> 00:48:00.775]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:00.775 --> 00:48:05.775]  [Music]
[00:48:05.797 --> 00:48:08.418]  My four-year-old daughter loves this song.
[00:48:08.458 --> 00:48:09.959]  She loves old TV themes.
[00:48:10.219 --> 00:48:11.900]  We were driving around yesterday.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.241]  I took her to the local park in the morning.
[00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:14.981]  We were driving back.
[00:48:15.001 --> 00:48:17.402]  She said, I want to hear Hawaii Five-0.
[00:48:18.963 --> 00:48:20.283]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[00:48:21.123 --> 00:48:22.544]  And here we are listening to it right now together.
[00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:25.412]  Humans made that.
[00:48:25.472 --> 00:48:28.214]  A great orchestra made that beautiful music.
[00:48:28.614 --> 00:48:29.335]  We're incredible.
[00:48:29.375 --> 00:48:30.295]  We're made by God.
[00:48:30.355 --> 00:48:31.736]  Humans are good, not bad.
[00:48:31.756 --> 00:48:39.442]  We're not going to let a bunch of nasty globalists, the worst of our species, tell us we're trash and we've got to die so they can have the future.
[00:48:39.462 --> 00:48:46.067]  We're not going to accept a World ID, World Cashless Society, where they admit they're going to use it to control every aspect of our lives.
[00:48:46.527 --> 00:48:47.528]  This isn't coming.
[00:48:47.688 --> 00:48:48.409]  This is here.
[00:48:49.963 --> 00:48:58.807]  I want to give the number out coming up next segment and take calls throughout the balance of transmission interspersed a ton of huge news and massive information.
[00:48:59.627 --> 00:49:05.470]  But I want to just take a deep breath and think about something here.
[00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:10.084]   We focus on The puppets of the New World Order.
[00:49:10.104 --> 00:49:20.351]  We focus on the Boris Johnsons, and the Barack Obamas, and the Hillary Clintons, and the Joe Bidens, and the Macrons, and all the rest, the Merkels.
[00:49:20.411 --> 00:49:21.312]  They're just minions.
[00:49:21.772 --> 00:49:23.654]  They're just front people for the globalists.
[00:49:24.174 --> 00:49:25.135]  They're basically actors.
[00:49:26.976 --> 00:49:30.098]  They're little trusted, sycophantic bootlickers.
[00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:38.871]   But when we talk about Leadership.
[00:49:40.412 --> 00:49:41.833]  People like Nigel Farage.
[00:49:43.054 --> 00:49:44.595]  People like Rand Paul.
[00:49:45.555 --> 00:49:46.416]  People like that.
[00:49:46.676 --> 00:49:52.840]  Do you hear them attacking what's currently happening?
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.861]  And you actually do with Nigel Farage.
[00:49:54.921 --> 00:50:03.886]  He's, when it comes to big picture and actually covering every fact that it's a world corporate government takeover, that the vaccine passports are for a global carbon tax.
[00:50:03.746 --> 00:50:10.106]  I mean he gets it.
[00:50:10.106 --> 00:50:17.184]   But when you talk about our leaders here in the United States, Rand Paul was on TV this
[00:50:17.755 --> 00:50:19.396]  Rand Paul warns against socialism.
[00:50:20.398 --> 00:50:24.242]  It always ends up in state-sponsored authoritarianism and violence, close quote.
[00:50:24.823 --> 00:50:25.663]  That's a great statement.
[00:50:25.683 --> 00:50:26.204]  It's totally true.
[00:50:26.564 --> 00:50:30.309]  Quote, it always ends up with state-sponsored authoritarianism and violence.
[00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:31.270]  And that's where we are.
[00:50:33.903 --> 00:50:41.665]  Violently coming after us with an experimental shot that they had actually tested that they knew caused ADE and a bunch of other serious disorders and deaths.
[00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:45.847]  Now Colin Powell took the shot and died and Hank Aaron and everybody else you can imagine.
[00:50:48.528 --> 00:50:50.008]  All these other people take it and almost die.
[00:50:50.028 --> 00:50:50.928]  All these children take it.
[00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:52.129]  Olympic athletes take it.
[00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:55.830]  NBA players take it and are out forever because mycocarditis.
[00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:00.611]  They're assaulting us.
[00:51:02.472 --> 00:51:05.412]   But I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[00:51:05.732 --> 00:51:10.675]  Should I go protest at Rand Paul's office to say, hey, you're a great guy.
[00:51:10.695 --> 00:51:11.635]  You're a major leader.
[00:51:12.276 --> 00:51:19.680]  Will you please point out this is a UN corporate takeover and that the Davos group went to the UN over a year ago.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:25.043]  They had a previous plan five years ago for a global vaccine passport QR code system.
[00:51:26.015 --> 00:51:28.136]  They already had it ready under Disease X and other names.
[00:51:28.637 --> 00:51:47.390]  And then once you adopt that, and once the UN says this is the standardized system everybody should use, the corporations implement it, and then it controls everything we do and becomes the new cashless society and the new carbon trading system and tells us where we can go and what we can do and tells us when we're allowed outside our houses.
[00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.471]  That has officially been announced.
[00:51:50.552 --> 00:52:10.218]   And I showed you earlier, The actual Davos Group video, and I showed you screenshots, where it says on there, just like the pandemic, wasn't the pandemic, it was the lockdown that they put in place using the pandemic as the excuse, cut global air travel and cut carbon emissions, we're gonna cut it by carbon taxes via your vaccine passport.
[00:52:10.778 --> 00:52:12.359]  They say that.
[00:52:14.821 --> 00:52:18.824]  Now again, I know we've said this a thousand times or more on air, but now it's here.
[00:52:20.321 --> 00:52:30.121]   And I go and I search for someone pointing out that Debo's group rolls out UN approved global ID.
[00:52:30.121 --> 00:52:35.840]  That's what this is.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:42.840]   This is a global UN run corporate controlled designed world ID that Xi Jinping a year and a half ago said,
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:48.320]   we need to adopt the UN QR code global standard vaccine passport.
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:54.086]  You pull that up, Xi Jinping calls for global QR code under UN standards.
[00:52:55.144 --> 00:53:10.532]  And here we are under Xi Jinping, UN, Fortune 500 announcement for a tracking system on your phone to go to a sporting event, a grocery store, to have a job, to go to a hospital, to get on a bus, a train, or an airplane, or buy a car, or have a bank account.
[00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:17.095]  And then they have the nerve to say in the piece, and this has zero tracking.
[00:53:18.749 --> 00:53:21.393]  That's like saying a great white shark is not a shark.
[00:53:21.813 --> 00:53:24.417]  This great white shark has nothing to do with a great white shark.
[00:53:25.258 --> 00:53:27.160]  King Kong has nothing to do with a gorilla.
[00:53:27.881 --> 00:53:30.925]  Donkey Kong has nothing to do with a gorilla or video games.
[00:53:32.027 --> 00:53:34.550]  The color blue has nothing to do with blue.
[00:53:39.164 --> 00:53:42.705]  And they lie on purpose just to get you used to being lied to.
[00:53:42.745 --> 00:53:44.005]  Like, oh, they're catching us in lies.
[00:53:44.385 --> 00:53:51.067]  Alright, do the psychological warfare technique of just lying constantly until it's just a tissue of lies.
[00:53:52.508 --> 00:53:53.768]  That's called complete gaslighting.
[00:53:55.848 --> 00:53:57.409]  So, we're here.
[00:53:57.629 --> 00:53:59.129]  And, you know, I meant to get to this Friday.
[00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.590]  I meant to get to it Saturday and Sunday.
[00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:01.170]  I did shows.
[00:54:02.708 --> 00:54:11.593]  The problem is, I've already read this several times, and I'm already aware of their operations, and once I see it again, it's hard to read it on air, it gets me so angry, but you know what?
[00:54:11.633 --> 00:54:21.397]  We'll take phone calls starting at the bottom of the hour, and I'll take them to the bottom of the next hour, and then I'm gonna read from the document, NATO's plan to hack your brain.
[00:54:23.559 --> 00:54:26.300]  And of course, what they're telling you now is like 30 years old.
[00:54:27.601 --> 00:54:30.042]  But the sixth dimension of warfare is mind war.
[00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:35.253]  You may have heard of it before on a certain show.
[00:54:35.313 --> 00:54:36.355]  It's called InfoWar.
[00:54:36.895 --> 00:54:39.278]  We use the truth to counter lies.
[00:54:39.318 --> 00:54:45.926]  We use logic and stability and God's law in a system that's totally transparent and is self-generating.
[00:54:46.626 --> 00:54:52.954]  They have a system of putting you into a total artificial reality of complete fraud, total immersion in a matrix-like system.
[00:54:54.411 --> 00:55:01.155]  This is the only way they can get you to go with them and accept them and be convinced as being born into this as a child.
[00:55:01.195 --> 00:55:08.239]  And this is a proto-matrix, the VR goggles and the smartphones and the screens and the 10 hours of screen time and the being plugged into it.
[00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:10.420]  And then finally, hey, there's a wire in your head.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.122]  You got to pick up the new season of your favorite show by getting this chip in your head.
[00:55:14.142 --> 00:55:15.823]  This isn't five years out.
[00:55:15.863 --> 00:55:16.884]  This is a year out.
[00:55:17.224 --> 00:55:18.725]  This is already happening with the military.
[00:55:20.299 --> 00:55:24.521]  Yeah, they're already putting wires into CIA operatives' brains and the rest of it.
[00:55:24.561 --> 00:55:25.422]  It's been going on a while.
[00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:32.406]  They're also giving them, quote, vaccines that augment them, that actually go in and change brain chemistry that aren't vaccines.
[00:55:32.426 --> 00:55:35.047]  They're genetic engineering.
[00:55:36.268 --> 00:55:37.369]  We're not in the year 2020.
[00:55:37.409 --> 00:55:38.209]  We're not in the year 2021.
[00:55:38.048 --> 00:55:48.478]  We're not in the year 2021. We're really in the year 3000.
[00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:51.567]  And I mean that hypothetically.
[00:55:51.603 --> 00:55:53.044]  Don't think of this as 2021.
[00:55:53.124 --> 00:56:04.168]  Think of the 30, 40, 50 years of advanced technology that's so advanced and no longer theoretical that even comparing it to what you've seen rolled out against you today, you wouldn't even be able to recognize it.
[00:56:05.248 --> 00:56:14.552]  But it's still hard to deploy against seven and a half billion people, especially if we figure out what's happening and smash all of it around us, it will then shut down.
[00:56:16.533 --> 00:56:20.118]  So it's growing its tentacles of electronic surveillance and control.
[00:56:20.438 --> 00:56:32.795]  It's shutting down all the human infrastructure of farming and ranching and machining and metallurgy and just human interaction so it can then absorb what's left of humanity and that's its plan.
[00:56:37.032 --> 00:56:39.093]  And you don't hear any of this from Rand Paul.
[00:56:39.153 --> 00:56:40.253]  You don't hear any of this from any of them.
[00:56:40.533 --> 00:56:47.055]  You don't hear them talking about, hey, a global carbon tax has been announced and is being implemented by major airlines right now.
[00:56:47.875 --> 00:56:49.435]  They always use the airlines implemented first.
[00:56:49.776 --> 00:56:50.096]  It's here.
[00:56:51.636 --> 00:56:51.956]  Wow.
[00:56:52.096 --> 00:56:56.857]  So this isn't just about, I get these shots you make me take and now I can travel and it's all over.
[00:56:56.977 --> 00:56:57.518]  No, no, no.
[00:56:57.898 --> 00:57:04.560]  Now it's a credit score and now we're going to tax you and now we're going to surveil you and have a database, but no one's watching you.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:05.880]  It actually says that.
[00:57:07.059 --> 00:57:12.882]  There's no surveillance, no tracking, but we track everything you do.
[00:57:15.704 --> 00:57:23.908]  These are just bad, bad people, folks, committed to pure evil and being given power over the earth because they aren't working for our side.
[00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:27.630]  So, wow, I'd live to see it.
[00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:34.273]  Margaret the Beast officially announced and rolling out, coming to a town near you very soon.
[00:57:34.333 --> 00:57:35.154]  In fact, it's already there.
[00:57:36.187 --> 00:57:37.967]  So we live in extremely epic times.
[00:57:38.007 --> 00:57:39.368]  Welcome back to the broadcast.
[00:57:39.388 --> 00:57:41.548]  It's Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:41.568 --> 00:57:54.691]  We just tuned in for the first time wondering what you're listening to on some local radio station as you drive through the countryside or to the big city or through the hamlets that dot this great land or if you're listening to this later on a podcast in the year 2025.
[00:57:56.452 --> 00:58:00.233]  I hope we're still even able to be on air next year, much less then.
[00:58:00.553 --> 00:58:01.953]  These are serious times.
[00:58:03.154 --> 00:58:18.100]   But facing the reality It's the best shot we've got of mitigating how bad it's going to be dealing with this globalist attempt to bankrupt the planet, to bring humanity to its knees, to then carry out our orderly extermination.
[00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:21.883]  Because the globalists believe they will inherit the Earth.
[00:58:21.903 --> 00:58:32.171]  And all they're going to inherit is being cut off from God, like Colin Powell is now experiencing, in my humble opinion.
[00:58:32.191 --> 00:58:33.212]  I hope that's not the case.
[00:58:34.537 --> 00:58:35.897]  I think it's a foregone conclusion.
[00:58:37.178 --> 00:58:50.062]  Now, I said I want to talk about solutions some, and I just did last segment, but I need to point out that's the solution, is not focusing on the Fauci's or the Bill Gates's of the world.
[00:58:50.082 --> 00:58:51.122]  I mean, we need to expose them.
[00:58:51.562 --> 00:58:52.442]  We need to oppose them.
[00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:53.903]  We need to call for their imprisonment.
[00:58:53.923 --> 00:58:55.263]  We need to point out the crimes they've committed.
[00:58:55.543 --> 00:58:56.423]  We need to protest them.
[00:58:56.443 --> 00:58:57.624]  We need to not submit to them.
[00:58:58.324 --> 00:59:00.184]  We need to discredit them.
[00:59:00.204 --> 00:59:00.785]  They deserve it.
[00:59:01.205 --> 00:59:01.705]  It's the truth.
[00:59:03.775 --> 00:59:12.607]  But we should also point out that for all Trump's problems, and he certainly went along with the vaccine to get the economy going because he believed it was a vaccine, which it wasn't.
[00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:15.832]  And now he's against forced inoculation.
[00:59:17.247 --> 00:59:21.791]  And now he points out we don't need boosters and it's a scam by Pfizer, that Pfizer shouldn't be running policy.
[00:59:22.011 --> 00:59:25.574]  So Trump's starting to come around, but Trump did pull us out of UNESCO.
[00:59:25.914 --> 00:59:31.738]  Trump did pull us out of the UN Human Rights Commission that was run by a bunch of dictators and Islamicists.
[00:59:32.679 --> 00:59:48.355]   And Trump did get us out of a bunch of the UN treaties, like the one on quote refugees and the rest of it, and recognized that it was the WHO that basically presided over with Fauci and Gates and Daszak The creation of COVID-19.
[00:59:48.435 --> 00:59:54.812]  So our champion is Rand Paul, who in five different hearings over the last year...
[00:59:57.233 --> 01:00:02.115]  Has shown that Fauci committed perjury and shown that Fauci was involved in gain of function.
[01:00:02.455 --> 01:00:03.696]  But it was more than gain of function.
[01:00:03.736 --> 01:00:05.977]  He specifically made COVID-19.
[01:00:06.237 --> 01:00:13.720]  They specifically went to the Pentagon with his project and said in 2017, we want to be able to release this open air in China.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.020]  And they said, you're going to infect humans.
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.321]  That's a war crime.
[01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:20.743]  Paul has had Fauci in front of him since that news came out.
[01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:21.643]  Where is it?
[01:00:23.664 --> 01:00:25.525]  I mean, you talk about political kill shot.
[01:00:25.665 --> 01:00:26.045]  That's it.
[01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:37.236]  I mean, Fauci did create it and did release it right on time to take over the world economy and to launch the mRNA revolution.
[01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:48.244]  We have video of him in 2019 saying, yes, I want to use this new virus to blow up the political system and to get rid of 10-year authorization for vaccines so we can bring mRNA in.
[01:00:50.697 --> 01:00:58.239]  And then Reuters fact-checked it and said it wasn't true, and only fact-checked a one-minute clip out of the 40-minute report, which had all the proof in it.
[01:00:59.019 --> 01:01:03.180]  But you know, the CEO of Reuters is also on the board of, you guessed it, Pfizer.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.800]  So, there you go.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.261]  And it pays Reuters as a sponsorship to product place that the vaccine's safe and effective.
[01:01:10.481 --> 01:01:12.842]  That's so damn illegal.
[01:01:14.198 --> 01:01:20.423]  Yeah, James C. Smith on the left is the CEO of Reuters in charge of informing people about the COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:01:20.783 --> 01:01:24.386]  On the right is a current member of the board of directors of Pfizer.
[01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:28.370]  So, here's the good news.
[01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:34.435]  And I've used this parallel, this allegory, or this parable, that's a true story, a lot.
[01:01:36.176 --> 01:01:39.499]  Because it's the best one to use for really what's going on.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:49.605]   Because this thing is Seven parts real science and globalist tyranny, and they've got a plan to take over.
[01:01:51.566 --> 01:02:00.971]  But it's three parts bravado, chutzpah, megalomania, and spiritually being led by a dark force to destroy.
[01:02:01.571 --> 01:02:06.374]  But they act like they've got a system, and they're doing this to save the earth, but they're really doing it because they like to kill people.
[01:02:06.794 --> 01:02:07.554]  They like to play God.
[01:02:09.455 --> 01:02:21.217]   But if you go see the movie, About the BP oil spill, it's based on the transcripts from the trial that are very, very accurate from the witnesses on the Deepwater Horizon.
[01:02:22.597 --> 01:02:25.598]  And it's got Kurt Russell and Mark Wahlberg in it.
[01:02:25.638 --> 01:02:26.799]  They both do an excellent job.
[01:02:26.819 --> 01:02:27.479]  It's an excellent film.
[01:02:27.519 --> 01:02:28.260]  It's very accurate.
[01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:36.863]  They had a lot of computer logs and witnesses and it all came out in that huge, you know, multi-billion dollar trial.
[01:02:38.844 --> 01:02:58.077]   And the executives at BP back in England And the executives in Houston told the executives in New Orleans, and then the bosses and the managers out on the drilling rig, that it was one of the deepest drilling rigs they ever did at that time, whatever, 30-something thousand feet.
[01:02:58.677 --> 01:03:10.459]  And they said, listen, you're spending $25 million a day with lines of ships full of concrete, oil tankers full of concrete, to pump concrete down the hole you're drilling.
[01:03:11.539 --> 01:03:14.501]  And we don't think you need concrete to keep that hole.
[01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:18.845]  We think the water pressure will keep oil and gas down in there.
[01:03:19.305 --> 01:03:22.568]  And so we are suspending putting any more concrete down the hole.
[01:03:22.908 --> 01:03:25.630]  And the engineers all said, we have the mathematical equations.
[01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:38.420]  If you do that, it's basically a 99% chance that within a few days, it'll fail and blow up and blow all the different gauges and controls out.
[01:03:39.585 --> 01:03:42.025]  And you're going to have the biggest oil spill, gas spill in history.
[01:03:42.466 --> 01:03:44.486]  We've already drilled through a bunch of oil and a bunch of gas.
[01:03:44.706 --> 01:03:45.946]  We're just trying to hit the mother load.
[01:03:46.426 --> 01:03:49.307]  And if you do that, it's going to be a chain reaction.
[01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:58.088]  And the transcripts, because they even sent text messages and emails, are like, we're a $57 billion company.
[01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.429]  We don't care about gravity.
[01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:03.289]  We don't care about math.
[01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:08.050]  And so the engineers refused for about a week.
[01:04:09.502 --> 01:04:10.943]  And they fly out an executive.
[01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:14.607]  And I've seen the trial.
[01:04:14.647 --> 01:04:16.588]  The executive talks the same way as the actor does everything.
[01:04:16.608 --> 01:04:18.230]  He's like, he's got this coon-ass accent.
[01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:20.151]  We're gonna do it.
[01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:21.332]  It sounds like the Virginia governor.
[01:04:21.613 --> 01:04:25.196]  We keep baby alive and you're comfortable.
[01:04:25.476 --> 01:04:32.242]  And he's sitting there going, we gonna make billion dollar, not have them put concrete in hole.
[01:04:35.345 --> 01:04:36.646]  And they did it and it blew up.
[01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.292]  The engineers said, we're stepping back, we're not doing it.
[01:04:43.712 --> 01:04:45.553]  And the executive said, OK, do it.
[01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:49.995]  And you know it didn't blow up for about, what, 10 hours or whatever it was?
[01:04:50.556 --> 01:04:50.936]  I forget.
[01:04:50.956 --> 01:04:53.637]  They're like, well, we'll see if you're right.
[01:04:53.777 --> 01:04:54.157]  OK.
[01:04:54.177 --> 01:04:55.958]  And then, of course, it blows up.
[01:04:57.579 --> 01:04:59.940]  And that's one level of this.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:05.023]  Because the globalists and the executives got told to do this, and they actually figured it would fly.
[01:05:06.089 --> 01:05:07.151]  They didn't do the research.
[01:05:07.191 --> 01:05:08.352]  This stuff is going to kill a bunch of people.
[01:05:08.733 --> 01:05:09.354]  They didn't care.
[01:05:09.975 --> 01:05:11.677]  They were told by the bankers above them to do this.
[01:05:12.017 --> 01:05:16.083]  They'd been in corporate positions for decades following orders, so they just followed orders again.
[01:05:16.884 --> 01:05:25.042]   But up on the top, and it was war game in SPARS 2023-2025, War game by John Hopkins and Bill Gates.
[01:05:25.863 --> 01:05:31.309]  How they're even going to fry the executives and even have them resign and they're going to put them in prison later.
[01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:36.074]  Oh, the virus and the money making and all that's just a small part of it.
[01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:38.476]  They intended you to learn it was going to kill you.
[01:05:39.037 --> 01:05:41.439]  And then you're going to quit your job and that collapses society.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.582]  See, this has all been figured out.
[01:05:44.733 --> 01:06:01.970]  And I think, because British Petroleum, I'll explain this when we come back, is actually behind the whole globalist green carbon tax movement, I think they ordered them to do that knowing it would blow up, and then they could bring in this whole environmental revamping and takeover of the rest of the industries, which then did indeed happen through a UN agreement from that spill.
[01:06:02.861 --> 01:06:04.442]  And they only had to pay a few billion in damages.
[01:06:05.222 --> 01:06:05.982]  See how that works?
[01:06:06.622 --> 01:06:06.923]  Yeah.
[01:06:07.223 --> 01:06:08.063]  You think I'm stupid?
[01:06:08.383 --> 01:06:10.144]  They ordered that, they knew it was going to blow up.
[01:06:10.904 --> 01:06:24.289]  It's time for nationalists, for Christians, for conservatives, for just people that are pro-human, don't want to be in this whole environmental world government takeover system, to come together and realize how much trouble we're in.
[01:06:24.969 --> 01:06:31.200]   I don't care if you're Glenn Beck, I don't care if you're Joe Rogan.
[01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:33.741]  Doesn't matter if you're Tucker Carlson.
[01:06:34.641 --> 01:06:37.442]  Doesn't matter if you're Dan Bongino or all those people.
[01:06:40.143 --> 01:06:42.584]  Who a lot of them are hyper competitive.
[01:06:43.744 --> 01:06:44.485]  Rogan isn't.
[01:06:44.945 --> 01:06:45.545]  Tucker isn't.
[01:06:45.865 --> 01:06:48.406]  They're confident enough and I think Beck is getting to that point.
[01:06:49.688 --> 01:06:57.330]  Of working with other people who are in opposition to the New World Order because we're all being targeted by the globalists.
[01:06:58.131 --> 01:07:00.251]  This is a serious situation for everybody.
[01:07:00.271 --> 01:07:03.452]  This is very, very, very real now.
[01:07:04.613 --> 01:07:09.734]  What we as a culture and as a society are facing.
[01:07:10.414 --> 01:07:11.835]  This is a new type of warfare.
[01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:31.305]   This is the ruling, controlling families in financial interest of the earth Deciding to cut off human resources and to then sterilize and finally exterminate 90% at least of the world population.
[01:07:31.325 --> 01:07:36.469]  Can you imagine what that's going to look like and how they're going to do that and how they're psychologically rolling it out?
[01:07:36.989 --> 01:07:42.974]  Like it's a good thing and telling you there's too many people and telling you isn't it great COVID-19 taught us to be locked down.
[01:07:43.335 --> 01:07:49.500]  So now you're going to be locked down permanently via a carbon passport via your cell phone vaccine pass.
[01:07:51.314 --> 01:07:56.898]  A vaccine pass for something that's not a vaccine that poison you and removes your immune system.
[01:07:56.938 --> 01:07:57.539]  Step one.
[01:07:57.859 --> 01:07:58.940]  Tracking you and poisoning you.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:07:59.941]  Step two.
[01:08:00.341 --> 01:08:08.728]  Tying it to everywhere you go and what you do and everything you buy and sell with carbon taxes and then just prohibiting out of the gates where you can go and what you can do.
[01:08:09.068 --> 01:08:19.316]  Training you to accept that and saying this new travel carbon tax enables you to travel by reducing your amount of travel.
[01:08:19.476 --> 01:08:20.237]  Those are quotes.
[01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:24.296]  By splitting your throat, it helps you live longer.
[01:08:25.276 --> 01:08:28.338]  When I throw you in this lake of lava, it makes you feel better.
[01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:32.940]  When I shoot you in the head, it makes your headache go away.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:33.920]  Well, yeah, because you're dead.
[01:08:36.201 --> 01:08:37.402]  Oh, you slammed your finger on the door?
[01:08:37.442 --> 01:08:38.362]  Here, let me cut it off.
[01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:46.126]  I mean, this is just wild in your face, because they've learned, with the general public, about half the public's in a trance state.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:57.705]  They shuffle around, they're not really awake, they're not really alive, and they can be programmed, if something's just said calmly, in an NPR voice, like, soon things will be back to normal.
[01:08:58.165 --> 01:09:11.271]  Soon you'll have your vaccine pass, and then you'll have your carbon pass, so that there'll be less travel, so you can travel where you want to, and you'll just pay a tax, and it's for the earth, and oh, it's so nice to stay asleep.
[01:09:13.952 --> 01:09:15.673]  So again, this is the big issue.
[01:09:17.611 --> 01:09:31.501]  I could have a wildly entertaining show with leftists acting like idiots and all the brainwashing and all the craziness and, oh, Dex coming up, we're going to tell you about this, but I'm here asking you, what are you going to do about this?
[01:09:31.541 --> 01:09:32.542]  Who are you going to educate?
[01:09:32.822 --> 01:09:35.664]  Who are you going to wake up as they introduce this poison to us?
[01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:39.407]  And let me show you how the Davos Group works.
[01:09:41.451 --> 01:09:43.833]  It's got the Fortune 500 as members.
[01:09:44.353 --> 01:09:46.314]  They all organize under the private central banks.
[01:09:46.534 --> 01:09:52.098]  If you go and agree to do what the central banks want, then your corporation gets unlimited bank loans.
[01:09:52.659 --> 01:10:08.709]  And it basically doesn't matter where the money goes or what happens, as long as you're on board with their agenda and do what they want politically to promote the end of the family, attacks on heterosexual relationships, sterilization of children, Satanism, open borders, world government.
[01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:14.152]   If you do that, They'll just give you unlimited money that they make out of
[01:10:14.152 --> 01:10:16.782]   nothing because we accept it under the Bretton Woods agreement.
[01:10:16.782 --> 01:10:25.981]   And now again, they want to mop up what's left of the economy.
[01:10:26.082 --> 01:10:27.223]  I'm going to explain this.
[01:10:27.243 --> 01:10:31.585]  They have hundreds of times, fake currency, what there is, real things in the world.
[01:10:32.066 --> 01:10:34.267]  But they've got to figure out a way to get you out of your house.
[01:10:34.287 --> 01:10:36.348]  They've got to figure out a way to get you off your farm.
[01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:39.571]  They've got to figure out a way to get you off the land.
[01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:52.319]  That's their main goal, into these giant, high-rise buildings from China to Europe to the United States to Latin America they're building, forcing people, it used to go down to Yucatan, southern Mexico.
[01:10:53.769 --> 01:10:55.751]  Happy little farms, happy little families.
[01:10:57.312 --> 01:11:03.176]  They're all gone now, forced off their land into the compact cities to be exploited, and then up north to be exploited here.
[01:11:05.438 --> 01:11:12.524]  And millions have died, been murdered, killed, sold into slavery, chopped up, you name it, on their way to the U.S., and you don't hear a damn thing about them.
[01:11:14.585 --> 01:11:17.868]  This is true exploitation on a mass scale.
[01:11:19.039 --> 01:11:26.863]  And this is the ruling class engaged in globalist class warfare against people's bottom line.
[01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:31.844]   against people's right to live and have food and medicine and travel
[01:11:31.844 --> 01:11:35.443]   and go to the theater or go shopping or go to the church of their choice.
[01:11:35.443 --> 01:11:44.324]  I mean this is genocide.
[01:11:44.512 --> 01:11:46.013]  This is mass extermination.
[01:11:46.774 --> 01:11:50.243]   This is The takeover.
[01:11:50.323 --> 01:11:50.863]  And you know what?
[01:11:50.923 --> 01:11:52.885]  I know the third world's overpopulated in some areas.
[01:11:53.205 --> 01:11:54.767]  I know there's horrible poverty and squalor.
[01:11:54.787 --> 01:11:56.088]  I know there's a lot of issues.
[01:11:56.388 --> 01:12:06.718]  But that doesn't give the globalist authorization to run all this and dumb everybody down and poison people and manipulate the atmosphere and create all this GMO and create animal-human hybrids.
[01:12:07.098 --> 01:12:15.326]  The people running this are a thousand times worse than the worst slum ghetto in Brazil or India.
[01:12:17.014 --> 01:12:19.635]  They are the most selfish, horrible, evil people.
[01:12:19.675 --> 01:12:20.996]  They all hate each other.
[01:12:21.096 --> 01:12:23.337]  They hate their husbands, their wives, their children.
[01:12:27.118 --> 01:12:38.303]  They only have children because it's the closest thing to immortality for them so they can pass on their hatred of humanity and hope that one of their progeny ends up being the one to be able to carry out the mass extermination.
[01:12:38.663 --> 01:12:42.445]  I mean, these are psycho, high IQ killers.
[01:12:46.092 --> 01:12:48.813]  And if you don't come to grips with that, we have no hope.
[01:12:49.414 --> 01:13:08.163]  So where is Congress talking about, we have a world corporate government announcing world carbon taxes and tracker systems through the major corporations, totally illegal, absolute racketeering, absolute monopolies, absolute combines, absolute cartels.
[01:13:09.912 --> 01:13:35.945]  Telling us they're capturing our governments, saying their job is to take over the nation states, bragging at Davos that they have captured America, bragging on Klaus Schwab's own webpage that he has enslaved the country, that he's, quote, captured the United States, bragging five years ago when Trump first got elected that Davos Group and Xi Jinping would be able to, quote, crush Trump and America through trade.
[01:13:36.505 --> 01:13:38.427]  And you're like, well, they don't even build as much as we do.
[01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:39.428]  They've got all the regulations.
[01:13:39.688 --> 01:13:41.189]  How are they going to crush us in trade?
[01:13:42.150 --> 01:13:43.091]  By releasing a virus.
[01:13:44.192 --> 01:13:48.355]  Fauci, right around that same time, said Trump will be challenged by a novel virus.
[01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:50.037]  There will be a new giant pandemic.
[01:13:50.497 --> 01:13:55.822]  The crowd's all, ooooh, because they know he launched HIV and the response to it that killed even more people.
[01:13:56.422 --> 01:13:57.963]  I mean, these folks know who they are.
[01:13:58.024 --> 01:13:59.104]  They know what they're doing.
[01:13:59.144 --> 01:14:00.265]  They know what their plan is.
[01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:02.667]  And remember, they always wanted to federalize health care.
[01:14:03.348 --> 01:14:08.952]  To get full control over your life with the state and power of that, and now FEMA's come in and taken over most of the hospitals in the U.S.
[01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:13.555]  with the National Guard, and FEMA people are exempt from the shots.
[01:14:13.995 --> 01:14:25.502]  They fire all the regular folks that won't take the shots, then FEMA comes in without the shots, but they federalize it, and the hospitals get billions of dollars in emergency funding that was meant for, quote, millions of the hospitals dying.
[01:14:26.516 --> 01:14:29.560]  Fifteen days to flatten the curve, but now you know what the money really was for.
[01:14:30.001 --> 01:14:42.397]  FEMA taking over the hospitals and setting that emergency precedent, where now the hospitals will do whatever they're told for the real bio-attack that's coming in the future that won't kill one-tenth of one percent, but will kill five, ten, fifteen percent of people.
[01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:57.179]  So you're just getting used to National Guard and troops and emergency centers and, oh, FEMA camps and, oh, relocation centers and shelter-in-place and the shielding process to put healthy people in camps to protect them, and it's being announced all over the world, run by the UN.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.522]  Corporate global world government.
[01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:06.145]  To make you a slave, to make you dependent, and finally kill you.
[01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:10.711]  We're going to go to break.
[01:15:10.811 --> 01:15:13.292]  I want to hear from you on any of the subjects I've raised.
[01:15:14.033 --> 01:15:16.814]  First-time callers, I want to hear from you.
[01:15:17.274 --> 01:15:20.015]  Or if you ever got on hold and didn't get on air, that counts as a first-time caller.
[01:15:20.035 --> 01:15:20.095]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:20.115 --> 01:15:20.255]  877-789-Alex.
[01:15:20.275 --> 01:15:20.315]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:20.135 --> 01:15:25.135]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:15:25.135 --> 01:15:34.814]   Let me go right to your calls, next segment, and then, again, this is Pentagon documents
[01:15:34.814 --> 01:15:39.173]   on mind control that are new, not stuff from the '70s everybody obsesses on MKUltra.
[01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:41.247]  That's all nothing, that's a whitewash, limited hangout.
[01:15:41.267 --> 01:15:44.428]  We're gonna give you what's really going on coming up and so much more.
[01:15:44.848 --> 01:15:48.669]  Remember, Colin Powell just died from the COVID vaccine.
[01:15:49.349 --> 01:15:59.793]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide and talking about solutions, I see that Aaron has called in and says, Bill Gates and the quote elite are meeting up in Britain right now.
[01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:00.593]  I didn't know that.
[01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:14.276]  And one big solution is, when they have these different Davos groups, or Bilderberg group meetings, or other spin-offs, find out about them, watch what they're doing, you gotta watch them carefully, and then go protest at it.
[01:16:15.299 --> 01:16:16.460]  When it really exposes them.
[01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:19.343]  I remember exposing and covering Milderberg Group.
[01:16:19.523 --> 01:16:21.505]  Jim Tucker first exposed it 40-something years ago.
[01:16:22.126 --> 01:16:23.888]  And for decades they said it didn't exist.
[01:16:25.009 --> 01:16:27.411]  And then we finally got the footage and the proof and they had to admit it.
[01:16:27.571 --> 01:16:35.259]  Think how far we've come just getting the public to admit there's a globalist meeting in secret with our politicians to control them.
[01:16:35.499 --> 01:16:37.021]  And then please put that headline back on screen.
[01:16:38.643 --> 01:16:43.406]  There's the meeting with Boris Johnson and others with the corporate leaders.
[01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:47.688]  UK's Johnson invites Bill Gates, JP Morgan, Diamond, others to dinner.
[01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:52.050]  Yes, another little globalist meeting over there to decide what to do.
[01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:55.812]  It's all being run out of the criminals that control the UK.
[01:16:57.453 --> 01:17:00.735]  We're going to Andrew, Tim, Lone Wolf, Sanders, Aaron, Connor.
[01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:04.820]  Controlled demolition and others here in a moment.
[01:17:05.241 --> 01:17:10.984]  But there are ongoing protests outside the British Prime Minister's residence shouting, arrest Bill Gates.
[01:17:11.604 --> 01:17:12.485]  This just happened.
[01:17:12.625 --> 01:17:14.346]  I didn't even know this happened.
[01:17:14.406 --> 01:17:16.767]  The caller mentions that Gates is over there.
[01:17:16.827 --> 01:17:18.688]  We look it up and boom, there it is.
[01:17:18.728 --> 01:17:21.970]  We'll have that footage for you coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:17:22.711 --> 01:17:25.232]  We'll get it loaded into the system and we'll play the audio for you.
[01:17:25.992 --> 01:17:27.914]  We go to Aaron first here in just a moment.
[01:17:29.034 --> 01:17:30.295]  But I'm going to state the solution again.
[01:17:31.553 --> 01:17:43.218]  There is a corporate world government through the UN and through corporate agreements enforcing a worldwide ID to tax and control where you go and who you can visit.
[01:17:43.618 --> 01:17:50.701]  And they admit, and if you don't do what they want politically, they will punish you and take away your right to travel, your right to banking, everything.
[01:17:50.781 --> 01:17:51.321]  It's official.
[01:17:52.421 --> 01:17:55.903]  And they've done this to General Flynn, they've done it to me, they've done it to Roger Stone.
[01:17:55.923 --> 01:17:57.544]  And I don't even get into all the stuff they've done.
[01:17:58.104 --> 01:18:00.626]  But yeah, banned basically from everything.
[01:18:00.746 --> 01:18:06.849]  Airbnb, credit cards, bank accounts, whatever, it just made us stronger, we worked around it.
[01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.571]  But in the future, that's not going to be there.
[01:18:10.991 --> 01:18:16.735]  So the whole future is going to be what the globalists talk about in their prospectus, ghettos.
[01:18:17.694 --> 01:18:27.738]  Country ghettos and city ghettos where those that don't take the microchips, that's in the same Plandopolis report put up by the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation in 2011.
[01:18:27.998 --> 01:18:37.422]  And it says you will be forcibly put in ghettos and if you leave the ghettos and don't take a microchip, you're going to be shot.
[01:18:38.993 --> 01:18:51.106]  They even describe how they're going to go into rural areas and force you to go into the cities if you don't want your five-year-old being taught how to give a blowjob, or if your five-year-old doesn't want to be put on hormone blockers or whatever.
[01:18:51.607 --> 01:18:52.388]  You don't want that.
[01:18:52.588 --> 01:18:56.833]  They're going to put you in a basically open-air concentration camp.
[01:18:59.121 --> 01:19:06.464]  This is all being announced, and they go, oh, the world's too expensive, the capitalist system fell apart, so the UN had to take the world over.
[01:19:06.944 --> 01:19:08.625]  They're purposely breaking it.
[01:19:08.865 --> 01:19:09.925]  That's Cloward and Piven.
[01:19:12.746 --> 01:19:14.267]  So, this is all official.
[01:19:14.307 --> 01:19:15.207]  How do I know it's coming?
[01:19:15.487 --> 01:19:20.929]  They write books, they write white papers, they have cartoons for children, and you watch it and go, this is a hellish dystopia!
[01:19:21.109 --> 01:19:22.950]  They're showing kids it's fun and happy!
[01:19:23.610 --> 01:19:25.371]  And they don't know any better, they're growing up in it!
[01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:31.119]  It's like children don't know what a landline is.
[01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:32.701]  Children don't know what a newspaper is.
[01:19:33.561 --> 01:19:37.644]  They don't even know how to garden because they've been domesticated for what's about to happen.
[01:19:37.664 --> 01:19:39.485]  This has all been very well planned.
[01:19:40.706 --> 01:19:41.747]  Women don't breastfeed.
[01:19:42.247 --> 01:19:43.708]  Women don't have children vaginally.
[01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:45.490]  Everything's becoming artificial.
[01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.771]  And the globalists admit that's their plan.
[01:19:48.152 --> 01:19:49.212]  So I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:19:50.733 --> 01:19:55.497]   It's just we are now at the point Well, we're not in beta.
[01:19:55.597 --> 01:19:56.498]  We're in operational.
[01:19:56.698 --> 01:19:59.661]  And it's not big tech and the banks and the media are separate.
[01:19:59.681 --> 01:20:00.482]  They're all one group.
[01:20:01.683 --> 01:20:03.384]  Linked up with those that run the military.
[01:20:03.585 --> 01:20:04.946]  Think the military is going to save you?
[01:20:05.306 --> 01:20:06.648]  The globalists run the Pentagon.
[01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:09.050]  The worst people ever run the top of the Pentagon.
[01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:10.872]  The globalists put their people in.
[01:20:13.089 --> 01:20:17.954]  And now they're culling the military with all these litmus tests of, oh, you're racist because you love America.
[01:20:18.274 --> 01:20:20.556]  Or, oh, you're kicked out because you won't take a shot.
[01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:24.339]  That's designed to get the smart people out and collapse things further.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.662]  Doesn't mean you go ahead and take the shot.
[01:20:26.882 --> 01:20:28.183]  They give you a Hobson's Choice.
[01:20:28.503 --> 01:20:30.005]  But this has all been war-gamed.
[01:20:31.604 --> 01:20:33.825]  And where is the senators?
[01:20:34.185 --> 01:20:35.126]  Where are the House members?
[01:20:35.566 --> 01:20:36.466]  Where are the legislatures?
[01:20:36.727 --> 01:20:37.467]  Where are the governors?
[01:20:38.087 --> 01:20:39.448]  DeSantis is the best thing we got?
[01:20:39.988 --> 01:20:41.469]  He's a C-minus.
[01:20:42.249 --> 01:20:48.892]  The only one with a passing grade, in my opinion, of any governor who actually talks about some of the larger fraud in the globalist operations.
[01:20:49.293 --> 01:20:53.935]  Trump, for all his problems, talked about the UN, talked about the China virus, talked about Fauci.
[01:20:54.155 --> 01:20:56.076]  We need to see all of that and more.
[01:20:56.376 --> 01:20:58.037]  Ten times more than what Trump did.
[01:20:58.357 --> 01:21:00.158]  Should I go protest outside Mar-a-Lago?
[01:21:04.514 --> 01:21:05.515]  Let me tell you how Trump works.
[01:21:05.555 --> 01:21:09.278]  If I go have some lapdog meeting with Trump, he'll just talk the whole time and pat me on the head.
[01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:13.381]  But if I go bullhorn him for maybe three days straight, then he'll probably listen.
[01:21:13.581 --> 01:21:14.502]  That's what gets his attention.
[01:21:14.702 --> 01:21:19.126]  In fact, we should go protest at Trump's house and say, you're the best thing we had.
[01:21:19.326 --> 01:21:23.650]  Will you please speak out about the New World Order and the carbon tax and the world government?
[01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:24.951]  You helped get us into this.
[01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.612]  They lied to you about the vaccine.
[01:21:26.852 --> 01:21:28.053]  We understand you got set up.
[01:21:28.313 --> 01:21:29.394]  Now you're starting to expose it.
[01:21:29.474 --> 01:21:30.095]  Come all the way.
[01:21:32.947 --> 01:21:35.670]  But why won't Rand Paul and them go all the way and talk about this?
[01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:43.598]  Because, I mean, the UN does, the Davos Group does, the big corporations say, we're bringing in the Great Reset, we're gonna have carbon lockdowns every year.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:49.164]  Sure, he talks about how we're going under authoritarianism, that's good, but what does that mean?
[01:21:49.504 --> 01:21:52.447]  Who's putting us under authoritarianism, Rand Paul?
[01:21:53.088 --> 01:21:53.889]  The UN!
[01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:55.070]  The Davos Group!
[01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:58.646]  Let me show you again, Senator Paul.
[01:21:58.706 --> 01:22:01.447]  Here's screenshots from the World Economic Forum site and video.
[01:22:01.627 --> 01:22:03.027]  COVID pass plans to launch.
[01:22:04.868 --> 01:22:07.029]  Users will have their blood screened every time they travel.
[01:22:08.309 --> 01:22:17.313]  To preserve the environment, benefits of reduced air travel during the crisis, we have a carbon tax through the apps now being implemented by the Fortune 500 partners.
[01:22:19.874 --> 01:22:22.735]  Oh, but don't worry, it's going to track everything you do, but won't surveil you.
[01:22:24.617 --> 01:22:29.421]  It's like saying a woman having an orgy with 500 men isn't having sex.
[01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:31.682]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's just unbelievable.
[01:22:32.143 --> 01:22:36.246]  So all the double think, all the gaslighting, all the crap, all the lies.
[01:22:37.246 --> 01:22:41.450]  You guys get that video from them protesting outside Downing Street while Bill Gates is inside?
[01:22:42.363 --> 01:22:52.506]  Let's go ahead and roll that video of the police attacking people that dared peacefully stand on the sidewalk because you're not allowed to do that now because of COVID rules they can enforce anytime they want.
[01:22:52.766 --> 01:22:56.007]  Police attacking people for daring to say arrest Bill Gates.
[01:22:56.027 --> 01:22:56.447]  Here it is.
[01:23:00.952 --> 01:23:10.952]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:27.952]   We got more videos coming in of police arresting people.
[01:23:27.695 --> 01:23:28.356]  That's what I've read.
[01:23:28.376 --> 01:23:32.218]  We don't have those yet, but we're told that's Bill Gates trying to go in, and this is what happened.
[01:23:32.498 --> 01:23:33.418]  This is beautiful!
[01:23:33.879 --> 01:23:37.460]  Everywhere he goes, people need to be in his murdering face.
[01:23:38.301 --> 01:23:40.262]  People tell me, they say, Jones, you better watch out.
[01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:42.823]  You know, you've really pissed the globalist off.
[01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:44.684]  They don't want to make you a martyr, but you're really pushing it.
[01:23:45.545 --> 01:23:47.546]  Selling out 1%, selling out all the way.
[01:23:48.419 --> 01:23:54.600]  So I'm going to intensify what I'm doing, not because I have a death wish or not because I want to be set up and put in prison.
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:24:00.962]  I know they got a whole bunch of grand juries and FBI around the clock trying to find something to frame us and put me in jail.
[01:24:01.442 --> 01:24:03.462]  I mean, my God, you're killing unborn children.
[01:24:03.482 --> 01:24:04.783]  You're killing already born children.
[01:24:05.003 --> 01:24:07.003]  Pedophilia is being promoted on the national news.
[01:24:07.503 --> 01:24:10.164]  I cannot support this satanic system.
[01:24:12.793 --> 01:24:15.656]  So everybody thinks, oh, they'll get you if you stand up.
[01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:17.497]  They're going to get everybody if we don't stand up.
[01:24:18.058 --> 01:24:22.622]  The only course of survival is going 110% on against these people.
[01:24:23.703 --> 01:24:26.786]  You don't play sports and go 90% that's how you get injured.
[01:24:26.806 --> 01:24:29.408]  You got to go 100% or you get hurt every time.
[01:24:29.608 --> 01:24:33.452]  But if I get hurt, that's the way it is, folks, because somebody's got to stand up to these people.
[01:24:34.923 --> 01:24:36.063]  They're already saying you're not essential.
[01:24:36.083 --> 01:24:36.944]  They're already locking you up.
[01:24:37.164 --> 01:24:38.465]  They're already taking over the whole world.
[01:24:38.825 --> 01:24:40.165]  They're already engaged in all this tyranny.
[01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:40.906]  What are you going to do?
[01:24:41.226 --> 01:24:44.947]  I promise we're going to go to break and go right back with Aaron and all the other callers.
[01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:46.228]  In fact, we'll do it the whole next hour.
[01:24:46.888 --> 01:24:50.530]  And then I've got to spend some time on these big issues and these big stories I mentioned, but that's coming up.
[01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:54.231]  Separately, we will not be on air if you do not buy the products.
[01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:55.272]  Plus, they're amazing products.
[01:24:55.292 --> 01:24:58.793]  Today is the last day of the big mega supply chain breakdown sale.

[01:26:11.322 --> 01:26:12.342]  We got InfoWarrior.
[01:26:12.362 --> 01:26:12.963]  We got Robbie.
[01:26:12.983 --> 01:26:15.745]  We got Andrew, Tim, Lone Wolf, James, Aaron.
[01:26:16.724 --> 01:26:18.425]  Conor, controlled demolition, and John.
[01:26:18.445 --> 01:26:21.727]  I'm going to get to every one of these callers in this hour.
[01:26:21.807 --> 01:26:24.069]  Let's go to Aaron in FEMA Region 6.
[01:26:24.369 --> 01:26:36.077]  I'm glad you told us about Bill Gates and an elite meeting of globalists happening in Britain, and we confirmed it's happening, and it looks like there's a lot of protesters there right now pointing out that Bill Gates should be arrested for his bioweapon attack.
[01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:38.163]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:38.463 --> 01:26:44.326]  I kind of connected the dots this morning when I saw a happy anniversary.
[01:26:44.346 --> 01:26:51.749]  Today is the two-year anniversary of the Event 201 pandemic simulation.
[01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:56.512]  So I find it rather odd that they're meeting again on the same date.
[01:26:56.672 --> 01:26:59.333]  What do you think they'll be talking about at this meeting?
[01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:03.272]  Oh no, no doubt they're planning, because the center of the web is London.
[01:27:03.893 --> 01:27:08.377]  They're planning the next attack they're about to launch and deciding on whether or not they're going to implement it.
[01:27:08.857 --> 01:27:11.840]  In fact, a lot of them have been acting like they may not go with the next phase.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.783]  I think Gates is probably there saying, no, launch the attack.
[01:27:14.803 --> 01:27:16.605]  Because, you know, he's fallen from favor.
[01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:25.053]  He was field marshalling a lot of this, but about six months ago they started pulling him back because he was hurting their agenda as a symbol of evil.
[01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:26.654]  Because we'd exposed him.
[01:27:26.694 --> 01:27:27.434]  You'd exposed him.
[01:27:27.494 --> 01:27:28.335]  Others had exposed him.
[01:27:28.875 --> 01:27:30.836]  And then remember what Boris Johnson said last year.
[01:27:30.876 --> 01:27:42.943]  He said, Bill Gates, when I am the head of the G8 for 2021, when we have the rotating year every eight years, he said, Bill Gates will be the shadow head of the G8.
[01:27:43.063 --> 01:27:44.424]  I will do what Bill Gates says.
[01:27:45.204 --> 01:27:46.405]  So I'm glad you raised that point.
[01:27:46.445 --> 01:27:51.468]  You just reminded me that Boris Johnson said Bill Gates is in charge of the G8.
[01:27:53.609 --> 01:27:53.929]  Awesome.
[01:27:53.949 --> 01:27:56.392]  Well, I'm glad that we're putting these pieces together.
[01:27:56.412 --> 01:28:03.542]  I'm not sure if you saw that Gates' daughter got married this weekend to an Egyptian equestrian.
[01:28:04.443 --> 01:28:09.831]  So just all these kind of coincidences and things going on just raise a lot of red flags for us.
[01:28:11.007 --> 01:28:11.787]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:11.807 --> 01:28:18.029]  I mean, just more globalist insider families intermarrying with, quote, an equestrian.
[01:28:18.069 --> 01:28:19.849]  He's not from a rich, super powerful family.
[01:28:20.449 --> 01:28:24.570]  Just like Anderson Cooper isn't the heir to three of the richest families in the world.
[01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:26.250]  No, he owns nothing.
[01:28:26.290 --> 01:28:28.091]  If you look up his wealth, he owns nothing.
[01:28:28.391 --> 01:28:29.211]  He has nothing.
[01:28:29.251 --> 01:28:30.651]  He's a saint.
[01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:31.571]  He's an angel.
[01:28:31.872 --> 01:28:34.612]  It's you that's going to own nothing and have nothing as well, they tell us.
[01:28:35.052 --> 01:28:36.072]  So very, very interesting.
[01:28:36.092 --> 01:28:36.993]  Aaron, thanks for the call.
[01:28:37.033 --> 01:28:37.833]  Thanks for the points.
[01:28:38.573 --> 01:28:39.734]  Yeah, guys, look that up.
[01:28:39.794 --> 01:28:41.114]  I remember it was like over a year ago.
[01:28:41.154 --> 01:28:47.717]  He goes, Boris Johnson says Bill Gates will advise the G8.
[01:28:49.879 --> 01:28:53.220]  Bill Gates will be shadow minister on G8.
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.141]  It was something like that.
[01:28:54.421 --> 01:29:00.395]   And in the article, it's quotes of him saying, Bill Gates has done such a great job of the pandemic and leading forward.
[01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:04.338]  He's going to help us next year with the ongoing systems when we control the G8.
[01:29:04.618 --> 01:29:05.679]  He'll be my main advisor.
[01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:06.480]  I mean, wow!
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.982]  Talk about kissing Gates' ass.
[01:29:10.183 --> 01:29:13.106]  So, I'm going to go to break in a minute and a half.
[01:29:13.126 --> 01:29:14.127]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[01:29:14.167 --> 01:29:16.649]  I'm not going to go to callers yet because I don't want to cut you off.
[01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:17.450]  Who's up next year?
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.460]  Connor's got a question from California.
[01:29:23.081 --> 01:29:25.381]  What will we do to educate the children about tyranny?
[01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:29.782]  Man, that's a really important question, a place I've dropped the ball, even my own children.
[01:29:30.402 --> 01:29:32.583]  Because it's like, how do you tell them all this horrible stuff?
[01:29:33.063 --> 01:29:35.204]  But if you don't, the school's going to do it, the system's going to do it.
[01:29:36.004 --> 01:29:41.205]  And we've got controlled demolition, wants to talk about mainstream conservatives against Fauci, but taking the Vax.
[01:29:42.125 --> 01:29:44.146]  Infowarrior wants to talk about it's time to pull.
[01:29:46.386 --> 01:29:47.867]  Pullhorn, it's actually Bullhorn.
[01:29:49.116 --> 01:29:50.017]  My eyes are failing.
[01:29:50.117 --> 01:29:52.618]  It's time to bullhorn and protest.
[01:29:52.678 --> 01:29:53.398]  I totally agree.
[01:29:54.038 --> 01:29:57.840]  Robbie in Florida, father got the Pfizer shot, died months later.
[01:29:59.081 --> 01:29:59.781]  Sorry to hear that, Robbie.
[01:29:59.801 --> 01:30:00.321]  We'll go to you.
[01:30:00.821 --> 01:30:02.922]  Andrews in Texas, healthcare worker on the COVID vax.
[01:30:03.503 --> 01:30:06.524]  Tim, 1776 Worldwide, the Gates Foundation protest.
[01:30:08.225 --> 01:30:11.326]  Lone Wolf, vaccine passports in big cities.
[01:30:12.047 --> 01:30:16.429]  James, CNN, hit piece aired last night on Alex Jones.
[01:30:16.529 --> 01:30:17.129]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:30:18.618 --> 01:30:19.799]  I can't even keep track of all these.
[01:30:19.819 --> 01:30:21.120]  Is John Oliver attacking too?
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:22.881]  It's all a bunch of damn lies.
[01:30:23.381 --> 01:30:24.382]  Jones is crazy.
[01:30:24.442 --> 01:30:26.123]  He claims there's cures for COVID.
[01:30:26.463 --> 01:30:27.884]  Yeah, it's called your immune system.
[01:30:28.224 --> 01:30:30.585]  There's no such thing as any cure for COVID.
[01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.286]  Only the vaccine will protect you.
[01:30:32.526 --> 01:30:35.708]  Look at Colin Powell or Hank Aaron or so many others.
[01:30:35.728 --> 01:30:36.669]  Look what it did for them.
[01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:48.126]   So for the last two hours, I asked the question, why are conservative leaders like Rand Paul And Ted Cruz and other people that I think are great people and super smart.
[01:30:48.206 --> 01:30:48.726]  I know they are.
[01:30:49.346 --> 01:30:55.788]  Why aren't they talking about the Deimos Group and major corporations announcing world government, world IDs, that they're going to have carbon taxes on?
[01:30:56.148 --> 01:30:57.088]  They're not announcing it.
[01:30:57.768 --> 01:30:58.608]  It's launched.
[01:30:59.588 --> 01:31:00.168]  It's going on.
[01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:02.029]  I mean, world government taking over?
[01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:07.510]  World government pushing Congresses and legislatures aside?
[01:31:09.811 --> 01:31:11.071]  Absolute total tyranny?
[01:31:12.850 --> 01:31:14.712]  And remember what he said three weeks ago.
[01:31:14.752 --> 01:31:16.074]  I played the clip like five times.
[01:31:17.155 --> 01:31:26.825]  John Kerry, the climate czar, was asked on national British television, what are you going to do about the fact if you pass carbon taxes in the U.S.
[01:31:27.206 --> 01:31:29.328]  and Republicans just regain the House next year?
[01:31:29.949 --> 01:31:30.769]  He said, we don't care.
[01:31:30.809 --> 01:31:32.611]  We're doing this through the corporations of the U.N.
[01:31:32.932 --> 01:31:33.713]  They're implementing it.
[01:31:34.454 --> 01:31:35.275]  Nothing will stop us.
[01:31:35.795 --> 01:31:36.656]  That's the quote.
[01:31:36.956 --> 01:31:37.516]  It's gonna happen.
[01:31:38.657 --> 01:31:40.959]  I mean, man, guys, this is so bad.
[01:31:41.379 --> 01:31:51.347]  Even if you're willing to pay the 1.5 trillion in taxes that are selectively only put on certain companies, it is designed to create a post-industrial world and replace stuff with things that don't work.
[01:31:53.349 --> 01:31:55.491]  So this is very, very serious.
[01:31:55.511 --> 01:31:59.293]  And they wear their stupid mask when they're on TV, but when he's on a plane, he doesn't wear it.
[01:32:01.395 --> 01:32:05.012]   So they're rubbing everyone's faces In all of it.
[01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:11.155]  And now Colin Powell died of COVID complications after taking the COVID injection.
[01:32:11.175 --> 01:32:14.416]  We got callers on that same subject, Robbie and others.
[01:32:14.436 --> 01:32:18.298]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to James.
[01:32:21.539 --> 01:32:23.320]  Let's go ahead and talk to James from Texas.
[01:32:25.097 --> 01:32:27.239]  CNN hit piece aired last night on Alex Jones.
[01:32:27.339 --> 01:32:28.020]  I didn't know that.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.122]  There's so many hit pieces, CNN doesn't have very many viewers.
[01:32:31.663 --> 01:32:32.623]  So what is 500,000 libtards watching?
[01:32:35.615 --> 01:32:38.736]  It's important because they're the mouth of the establishment and it shows they're really mad at me.
[01:32:38.756 --> 01:32:40.236]  They attack me every week that I know of.
[01:32:40.836 --> 01:32:44.497]  Media Matters attacked again and John Oliver does have a big audience on HBO.
[01:32:44.837 --> 01:32:52.419]  He came out with a sickening evil hit piece saying that not only should Alex Jones be fully taken off the air, everyone else like him should be.
[01:32:52.839 --> 01:32:55.140]  Then he goes, this guy's the Vietnamese Alex Jones.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.381]  This lady's the Hispanic Alex Jones.
[01:32:57.641 --> 01:32:58.881]  We need to silence them!
[01:33:01.122 --> 01:33:04.211]   And all they say is, Can you hear me okay?
[01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:09.070]   controls Biden, America's being sold out, the COVID vaccines causing damage.
[01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:10.390]  I mean, all that's true.
[01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:13.030]   But even if it was a lie, they should have the free speech, right?
[01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:14.470]  I mean, John Oliver lies all day.
[01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:16.710]  But see, he works for the power structure.
[01:33:16.710 --> 01:33:19.390]  So let's talk to James in Texas.
[01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:21.510]  Tell me about this CNN hit piece so I can find it.
[01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:23.270]  Yeah, can you hear me okay?
[01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:24.270]  Yes, sir.
[01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:25.270]  I'm just making sure.
[01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:29.990]   So I had a guy on there last night that said he was a student that did the filming with
[01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:34.229]   you at Bohemian Grove and was showing images of Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:34.267 --> 01:33:38.889]  It even mentioned the cremation of care ceremony and said it was all done by a bunch of rich people.
[01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:44.191]  I don't know how that's a hit piece.
[01:33:45.271 --> 01:33:46.992]  No, they were going after President Trump.
[01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:50.033]  They had David Hogg on doing interviews and all kinds of stuff.
[01:33:50.274 --> 01:33:51.134]  But what show was it?
[01:33:52.151 --> 01:33:58.175]  I was like 9 or 10 o'clock last night on main CNN channel, because whatever was on Fox, I switched channels because I wasn't interested.
[01:33:58.595 --> 01:33:58.876]  Sure.
[01:33:59.036 --> 01:34:00.417]  I mean, I don't even know what that means.
[01:34:00.997 --> 01:34:02.838]  Who said they snuck in Bohemian Grove with me?
[01:34:03.559 --> 01:34:09.723]  They said the guy was a student that you had him, he was the one doing the filming for you or something like that.
[01:34:10.263 --> 01:34:11.524]  That is a complete lie.
[01:34:11.924 --> 01:34:15.807]  I shot the video in there in a little fanny pack I had on.
[01:34:15.947 --> 01:34:17.808]  That is total BS.
[01:34:19.613 --> 01:34:23.597]  I mean, all they do is lie anyway, so God knows what they'll do next.
[01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:27.502]  I mean, the stuff they do, the stuff they say, it's just mind-blowing.
[01:34:27.882 --> 01:34:30.185]  Well, what were they saying about Bohemian Grove?
[01:34:31.006 --> 01:34:35.651]  They were actually showing images of it and showing the fireworks and stuff going off while they were all standing there.
[01:34:36.812 --> 01:34:39.035]  It was a more clear image of it than I've ever seen.
[01:34:41.155 --> 01:34:43.055]  Yeah, there's a tweet about it.
[01:34:43.135 --> 01:34:49.537]  CNN's Lisa Lang did a show, This Is Life, on conspiracies and on cue.
[01:34:49.877 --> 01:34:54.318]  And the John Birch Society, looking for communists, and the message hasn't changed.
[01:34:54.378 --> 01:34:55.858]  It shows the rise of Alex Jones.
[01:34:56.158 --> 01:34:57.578]  This show was a wake-up call.
[01:34:58.018 --> 01:35:01.879]  I mean, the John Birch Society, if anything, they haven't been active enough the last 20 years.
[01:35:01.899 --> 01:35:02.579]  They're great people.
[01:35:03.039 --> 01:35:09.261]  Everything that John Birch founder said 65 years ago, 70 years ago, came true.
[01:35:12.069 --> 01:35:15.050]  And they said communist China will take over the world.
[01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:17.190]  They said the Vietnam War is a wrong and a fraud.
[01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:23.031]  They said that the leftist anti-war movement, CIA controlled and a dialectic.
[01:35:23.531 --> 01:35:24.951]  They exposed false flag terror.
[01:35:24.971 --> 01:35:28.552]  They exposed the plan for global government, UN world government carbon tax.
[01:35:28.852 --> 01:35:33.553]  First time I ever read about that was like 30 years ago before I was even on air from the John Birch Society.
[01:35:33.773 --> 01:35:38.334]  So there, I mean, what do you make of this, James, that world government is out in the open?
[01:35:38.354 --> 01:35:56.108]   I mean, I know I spent two hours on one story, I have hundreds and hundreds of incredible things, but isn't it a big deal that the Mark of the Beast has been announced by the Fortune 500, the merchants of the world, as the Bible says, through the UN, through the Davos Group, with a carbon tax to track you in live time through the vaccine passport.
[01:35:56.389 --> 01:35:58.591]  It's official now being rolled out.
[01:35:58.911 --> 01:36:00.372]  Is that not incredible, sir?
[01:36:01.133 --> 01:36:01.653]  Yes, it is.
[01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:02.654]  The veil is being lifted.
[01:36:02.734 --> 01:36:06.458]  It's just like it talks about in the Bible, about the truth being lies and the lies being truth.
[01:36:09.622 --> 01:36:11.143]  What else did you notice about the show?
[01:36:13.464 --> 01:36:20.207]  Like I said, they were going after Trump, had a long interview talking about David Hogg and going on about his sister being there at the school and everything else.
[01:36:21.467 --> 01:36:23.968]  Went on about him leaving the school and coming back.
[01:36:25.889 --> 01:36:29.370]  You know, we actually met and had a conversation, but it's been like 30 years ago.
[01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:30.911]  This is only the second time I spoke to you.
[01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:33.412]  It was at a high school in Fort Worth.
[01:36:34.333 --> 01:36:36.053]  It was my senior year of high school.
[01:36:36.113 --> 01:36:37.474]  I was fresh out of basic training.
[01:36:39.212 --> 01:36:42.315]  Well, I have stomped around Fort Worth in places, but I don't ever remember.
[01:36:42.336 --> 01:36:47.782]  I didn't go to school in Fort Worth, so I went to school in Dallas and the rest of the time in Austin.
[01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:48.542]  But God bless you.
[01:36:48.562 --> 01:36:49.564]  I appreciate your call, James.
[01:36:50.004 --> 01:36:51.045]  It's a small world.
[01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:51.566]  All right!
[01:36:53.151 --> 01:36:58.553]  Let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Texas, healthcare worker on the COVID vaccine.
[01:36:58.573 --> 01:36:59.313]  We'll talk to Robby.
[01:36:59.333 --> 01:37:00.153]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[01:37:00.173 --> 01:37:00.653]  Thanks for holding.
[01:37:00.953 --> 01:37:13.777]  I'm going to just go ahead and speak on what you were talking about, why they won't say, they being the constituents, the congressmen, these people in high profile about the Davos group and Agenda 2030, because they know better.
[01:37:14.297 --> 01:37:17.938]  They don't have the cojones you have, and they know if they say something, they're going to disappear.
[01:37:18.318 --> 01:37:21.859]  Oh, Senator Cruz just passed away with a such and such.
[01:37:22.543 --> 01:37:23.143]  That's what I think.
[01:37:23.243 --> 01:37:40.154]  I heard David Webb, I heard a caller calling David Webb, Patriot, XM, and this caller called in and said, look, I'm going to tell you, David Webb, it's all about, he started talking about Davos Group, Agenda 2030, he started talking about, and David stopped and said, look, man, I'm not into conspiracy theories.
[01:37:40.534 --> 01:37:44.276]  These FEMA camps, all they're doing there is just, they're keeping supplies in those places.
[01:37:44.796 --> 01:37:45.577]  Dismissed it.
[01:37:46.498 --> 01:37:47.158]  Dismissed it.
[01:37:47.717 --> 01:37:51.087]  And that's the reason why they don't talk about the Davos Group Agenda 2030.
[01:37:51.328 --> 01:37:53.294]  Nobody wants to talk about it because it's the truth.
[01:37:53.908 --> 01:38:01.070]  Well, they do have them full of supplies and now they've announced that during the next pandemic they're going to put the healthy children in them and take them from families.
[01:38:01.371 --> 01:38:02.831]  That image of children being taken.
[01:38:03.031 --> 01:38:04.192]  And they'll probably give them back.
[01:38:04.512 --> 01:38:07.413]  But the point is they're setting the precedent that we're all prisoners.
[01:38:07.713 --> 01:38:08.293]  I mean, look at this.
[01:38:09.073 --> 01:38:13.635]  All over the world they're saying, from Latin America to Europe, you don't have a shot, you can't go to the grocery store.
[01:38:13.935 --> 01:38:16.776]  They scan the QR code before you can go in the store.
[01:38:16.816 --> 01:38:19.877]  The doors won't open and if you don't do it, you're arrested.
[01:38:20.277 --> 01:38:21.117]  That's slavery.
[01:38:21.177 --> 01:38:21.878]  That's here.
[01:38:21.978 --> 01:38:22.738]  That's happening.
[01:38:24.447 --> 01:38:30.972]  And to speak on that, and I call it a Risley is because I'm in the medical field.
[01:38:30.992 --> 01:38:33.333]  I'm going to get a little quiet because I'm in an office.
[01:38:33.873 --> 01:38:34.834]  I'm in a medical field.
[01:38:34.914 --> 01:38:40.663]   There was two of us when the mandate came down from The correspondence, there was no policy.
[01:38:40.703 --> 01:38:45.626]  We just got an email that said, by this day, everybody has to have vaccination.
[01:38:45.926 --> 01:38:47.407]  You can upload it to the portal.
[01:38:47.807 --> 01:38:55.772]  Those who don't want the vaccine can do a religious, which I took, and my buddy in Arizona took, and or a medical exemption.
[01:38:56.212 --> 01:38:58.834]  Now, my doctor wasn't going to do it, even though I had heart surgery in 2012.
[01:38:58.894 --> 01:38:59.474]  He said, nope.
[01:38:59.814 --> 01:39:01.515]  He said, I recommend the CDC, sir.
[01:39:01.595 --> 01:39:02.296]  Go get your shot.
[01:39:03.016 --> 01:39:04.917]  Not going to do it, because my dad took it.
[01:39:04.937 --> 01:39:06.919]  I never had cancer.
[01:39:07.179 --> 01:39:07.459]  Died.
[01:39:08.024 --> 01:39:09.345]  My ex-wife's dad got it.
[01:39:09.405 --> 01:39:10.746]  Three days later, died.
[01:39:11.826 --> 01:39:12.066]  Dead.
[01:39:13.427 --> 01:39:13.747]  Gone.
[01:39:14.288 --> 01:39:16.249]  Well, look how it worked out for Colin Powell.
[01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:19.191]  I mean, they're not going to say that though, right?
[01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:24.254]  Well, I mean, maybe Matt Drudge is running the Drudge Report again or whatever because it's been better lately.
[01:39:25.134 --> 01:39:28.316]  Most media will not point out he was fully vaxxed, but the Drudge Report does.
[01:39:28.656 --> 01:39:33.099]  Colin Powell, dead from COVID, fully vaxxed, was fighting cancer.
[01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:56.108]  Terrible, but real quick, Alex, if we are in Texas, I'm in Texas, the so-called president or the chief, you know, whatever he's the chief of, the stolen election, if he just put out correspondence or an email, not an executive order, and Governor Abbott said, I'm going to put an EO out, who trumps who and how does that work?
[01:39:58.154 --> 01:40:05.600]  Well, that's a constitutional question of the courts, but if it's a state's rights issue and constitutional, the state would trump the federal executive order.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:09.163]  I mean, look, Trump tried to stop the illegal aliens running around in the sanctuary cities.
[01:40:09.443 --> 01:40:10.444]  The city's just ignored him.
[01:40:10.824 --> 01:40:13.606]  So we can do the same to the globalists with their puppet president.
[01:40:13.987 --> 01:40:14.727]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:14.747 --> 01:40:18.350]  Okay, I'm going right to Robbie and others.
[01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:19.751]  When we come back, please stay with us.
[01:40:20.672 --> 01:40:25.556]  They've turned us into a bunch of domesticated jellyfish, and now the globalists are making their move on humanity.
[01:40:26.667 --> 01:40:33.109]  And yeah, it's easy to get mad at the dumbed-down masses and say they get what they deserve, not being informed and fighting back, but the children don't deserve that.
[01:40:33.789 --> 01:40:36.670]  And God's watching, and God wants us to stand up and do the right thing, and we will.
[01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:40.231]  And we will bring the New World Order to justice.
[01:40:40.411 --> 01:40:42.312]  They're not in power because they're good people.
[01:40:42.332 --> 01:40:47.394]  They're in power because they're corrupt and willing to do it, and they have a drive to dominate and kill.
[01:40:48.794 --> 01:40:50.054]  It doesn't mean they're going to succeed.
[01:40:50.094 --> 01:40:51.375]  It means they can't help it.
[01:40:51.835 --> 01:40:54.596]  So we need to stop acting like they're the authorities.
[01:40:54.636 --> 01:40:55.056]  They're not.
[01:40:56.209 --> 01:41:00.111]  They're trying to overthrow the local police because they want to be in control of the police.
[01:41:00.751 --> 01:41:02.192]  They want to overthrow our economy.
[01:41:02.212 --> 01:41:06.454]  They want to make us dependent so they can enslave us and kill us.
[01:41:07.675 --> 01:41:09.155]  That's the whole left ideology.
[01:41:09.175 --> 01:41:09.956]  There's too many people.
[01:41:10.356 --> 01:41:13.137]  Then they want you to take a shot because they love you and they care about you.
[01:41:13.797 --> 01:41:14.798]  Let's go to your calls quick now.
[01:41:14.818 --> 01:41:16.059]  We've got a lot of amazing callers.
[01:41:17.119 --> 01:41:24.598]   One of the callers just called in and was talking about It's just incredible stuff about funeral director.
[01:41:24.958 --> 01:41:26.180]  Husband's a funeral director.
[01:41:27.061 --> 01:41:28.303]  Increased deaths of VAX.
[01:41:28.343 --> 01:41:32.668]  That's what the National Pathologist Union in Germany said.
[01:41:32.688 --> 01:41:39.277]  They said we're seeing a doubling in cancer deaths and a doubling in heart attack deaths.
[01:41:41.636 --> 01:41:41.956]  Doubling.
[01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:43.317]  And that's what you see in the statistics, too.
[01:41:43.337 --> 01:41:44.898]  I mean, look at the numbers we show.
[01:41:44.918 --> 01:41:52.343]  In fact, while I'm talking to the scholar, show that John Hopkins graphic again, country by country, of right when they give them the shots and then what happens, the death, the disease.
[01:41:52.763 --> 01:41:53.484]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:41:53.504 --> 01:41:54.605]  The heart attacks, the cancer.
[01:41:54.865 --> 01:41:56.005]  I mean, they did this on purpose.
[01:41:56.326 --> 01:41:59.708]  And what did all the top scientists say a year and a half ago before the shots started?
[01:41:59.748 --> 01:42:03.811]  They said it'll cause heart attacks and cancer, because they knew what the damn spike protein does.
[01:42:05.392 --> 01:42:07.093]  It's basically like cyanide in your body.
[01:42:08.434 --> 01:42:09.594]  This is just incredible.
[01:42:10.595 --> 01:42:12.717]  But see, they know the public can't admit to themselves.
[01:42:12.737 --> 01:42:13.397]  It's too horrifying.
[01:42:13.417 --> 01:42:13.637]  All right.
[01:42:14.038 --> 01:42:15.099]  Shut up, Jones, and go to calls.
[01:42:15.979 --> 01:42:18.021]  Let's talk to Robbie in Florida.
[01:42:18.341 --> 01:42:19.382]  Sorry to hear about your father.
[01:42:19.442 --> 01:42:20.083]  Tell us what happened.
[01:42:23.966 --> 01:42:24.486]  Alex, you there?
[01:42:24.646 --> 01:42:25.006]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:26.067 --> 01:42:26.348]  Hey, man.
[01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:27.228]  Hey, yeah.
[01:42:27.248 --> 01:42:31.772]  So my father received his second dose of the Pfizer shot in February.
[01:42:31.932 --> 01:42:33.513]  By June, he was passed away.
[01:42:35.439 --> 01:42:36.699]  They're saying it's a heart attack.
[01:42:36.719 --> 01:42:37.680]  They're saying it's a stroke.
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:40.621]  Honestly, they weren't sure because they've never seen anything.
[01:42:41.101 --> 01:42:49.803]  Whenever he went in there like this, he was in a coma by the time he got in the hospital, and he passed away from an acute myocardial infarction, to be exact.
[01:42:50.384 --> 01:42:56.566]  You know, looked up on the search engine, ran by a World Health Organization, digiaccess.org.
[01:42:57.206 --> 01:43:04.468]  So it's verified, and I get your frustration when you say, you know, this is all just, we keep repeating ourselves, it's all talking points.
[01:43:05.459 --> 01:43:08.581]  I agree, because now my father's dead, and this is another talking point.
[01:43:08.601 --> 01:43:10.883]  So, something needs to be done about it.
[01:43:10.903 --> 01:43:14.646]  People need to get up, they need to get active, and really decide what they want to do.
[01:43:15.106 --> 01:43:17.047]  Quit standin' in the middle of the line.
[01:43:17.468 --> 01:43:25.293]  Well, Darren McMarine put together, a few months ago, like a five minute video, where they just give prominent people that died from the shot, like three seconds.
[01:43:25.694 --> 01:43:28.476]  And you're looking at hundreds of people that died, who are prominent.
[01:43:29.256 --> 01:43:38.852]   And, again, The spike protein is particularly bad in black people because of the type of receptor sites on their cells.
[01:43:38.872 --> 01:43:39.912]  They're just a little bit different.
[01:43:40.753 --> 01:43:44.454]  And it just so happens, look how many black people have died that are prominent after they took the shot.
[01:43:44.934 --> 01:43:45.734]  I mean, so many.
[01:43:45.854 --> 01:43:54.857]  So this is also extremely race specific because again, also look at the receptor site that black folks have for the HIV delivery system.
[01:43:55.097 --> 01:43:57.498]  It's a lot easier for black folks to catch HIV.
[01:43:57.958 --> 01:44:00.678]  This chimera virus has the HIV delivery system.
[01:44:00.938 --> 01:44:11.221]  And what's incredible is we have the emails of Fauci saying, combine these four viruses from these animals in China that we have with the viruses we isolated with the HIV delivery system.
[01:44:11.421 --> 01:44:13.041]  I mean, we have him building COVID.
[01:44:13.361 --> 01:44:13.941]  It's incredible.
[01:44:14.641 --> 01:44:14.822]  Yep.
[01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:15.342]  Yep.
[01:44:15.962 --> 01:44:22.739]   And, you know, I'd love to know how Colin Powell passed away because, you know, it was swept underneath the rug that He was fully vaccinated.
[01:44:22.779 --> 01:44:30.142]  Well, if we would know the truth of how he died and, you know, the exact reason on, you know, the death certificate, maybe it would show exactly what we already know.
[01:44:30.182 --> 01:44:33.163]  But, you know, that's just going to be swept under the rug like everything else.
[01:44:33.663 --> 01:44:34.223]  Absolutely.
[01:44:34.264 --> 01:44:34.964]  God bless you, Robbie.
[01:44:34.984 --> 01:44:36.164]  And I'm really sorry about your father.
[01:44:36.184 --> 01:44:37.365]  But his spirit lives on forever.
[01:44:37.425 --> 01:44:39.105]  And sure, I should have asked him.
[01:44:39.165 --> 01:44:40.826]  I'm sure his dad thought, hey, I want to be protected.
[01:44:40.866 --> 01:44:41.526]  I want to help people.
[01:44:41.546 --> 01:44:42.286]  I don't want to make people sick.
[01:44:42.606 --> 01:44:45.668]  They were told you can't spread COVID and it won't hurt you and you're going to be taken care of.
[01:44:45.688 --> 01:44:49.589]  And he wouldn't believe the lie because he still thought his country and his government was run by good people.
[01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:55.142]  We always had some bad people, but now it's run by all bad people at the top, or people that are scared.
[01:44:56.023 --> 01:44:57.205]  Because yeah, they come after you.
[01:44:58.004 --> 01:45:03.985]  Your bank account, your life, they sue you, they try to kill you, but I mean, they're already killing everybody, so I'm not scared at all of what they do to me.
[01:45:04.186 --> 01:45:05.866]  Like, I'm super alive right now.
[01:45:06.186 --> 01:45:07.366]  I've never been this alive.
[01:45:07.386 --> 01:45:09.107]  And it's not because I'm a thrill seeker.
[01:45:09.127 --> 01:45:14.708]  I don't jump out of airplanes, I don't rock climb a bunch and stuff because I'm into, you know, daredevil stuff.
[01:45:14.748 --> 01:45:18.789]  But if I gotta do something and people are doing something evil, I'm gonna go up against them.
[01:45:19.169 --> 01:45:20.189]  And I don't have any fear of them.
[01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:22.390]  I got fear of letting them win.
[01:45:23.856 --> 01:45:25.957]  I wouldn't even call that emotion fear.
[01:45:25.997 --> 01:45:28.979]  It is more of a fiery, explosive drive.
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:32.841]  Let's talk to another person whose father died.
[01:45:32.861 --> 01:45:34.042]  We'll go to Chelsea in Tennessee.
[01:45:34.442 --> 01:45:36.723]  Grant, very sad to hear about your father.
[01:45:36.763 --> 01:45:37.344]  Tell us what happened.
[01:45:37.644 --> 01:45:38.684]  Grant from California.
[01:45:40.165 --> 01:45:42.066]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:42.106 --> 01:45:50.631]  First, I want to say Godspeed to you, to Owen, to your amazing crew who's doing incredible work.
[01:45:52.414 --> 01:45:55.056]  Yeah, I buried my father yesterday morning.
[01:45:55.076 --> 01:45:57.758]  He was murdered.
[01:45:58.838 --> 01:46:01.220]  He was murdered by the shots.
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:08.205]  He was living with my sister in Israel, who fought me tooth and nail.
[01:46:08.545 --> 01:46:18.733]  I had signed an overture to her because she was living with my father, who was having Alzheimer's problems.
[01:46:20.252 --> 01:46:23.113]  And I regret doing it now.
[01:46:23.133 --> 01:46:31.475]  The one thing I told her is, I said to her, I absolutely do not want him to get any of these shots.
[01:46:31.695 --> 01:46:32.855]  I said, you want to do it?
[01:46:33.935 --> 01:46:35.555]  That's your choice for yourself.
[01:46:36.296 --> 01:46:44.437]  But he's my father as well, and I do not want him to get these shots under any condition.
[01:46:45.118 --> 01:46:47.158]  Well, she went ahead and she did it anyway.
[01:46:48.224 --> 01:46:52.147]  And his physical condition got worse.
[01:46:52.187 --> 01:46:53.307]  She kept reporting.
[01:46:53.347 --> 01:46:58.370]  I insisted that she tell me what the doctors say, what the tests say.
[01:46:58.991 --> 01:47:14.040]  And every time she would relate information about the tests, these were classic symptoms that you reported from your interviews with Sherry Tenpenny and all the other great people.
[01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:21.374]  About what they found after doing blood tests with people.
[01:47:21.394 --> 01:47:24.836]  They were in the blood sites that were published online.
[01:47:26.077 --> 01:47:35.123]  And you know, I knew this was going to happen, but it's an entirely different thing to know and when it actually happens.
[01:47:36.746 --> 01:47:48.770]  In fact, they know that over 65% of people worldwide, it's the same number keeps popping up, that take the Pfizer, get a D-dimer test, meaning they have blood clots, and then it's even higher with Moderna.
[01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:51.771]  It's over 80% of people that take the Moderna.
[01:47:51.831 --> 01:47:52.711]  It's the really bad one.
[01:47:52.731 --> 01:47:54.232]  That's the one Bill Gates totally controls.
[01:47:54.892 --> 01:47:55.552]  They take that one.
[01:47:56.032 --> 01:47:58.213]  What injection did they give your father?
[01:47:58.233 --> 01:48:05.215]  He didn't tell me, and a lot of people who get these injections, when you ask them which shot you should take, they don't even know.
[01:48:06.092 --> 01:48:15.475]  Do you know what the true hallmark of stupidity in people is not that they don't know.
[01:48:15.495 --> 01:48:18.256]  It's that they refuse to know.
[01:48:19.456 --> 01:48:21.196]  You send them the information.
[01:48:21.216 --> 01:48:24.577]  You say, look, check the information.
[01:48:24.597 --> 01:48:24.898]  You're right.
[01:48:24.918 --> 01:48:25.758]  Listen, we're out of time.
[01:48:25.778 --> 01:48:26.398]  God bless you.
[01:48:26.438 --> 01:48:27.238]  I'm sorry for your father.
[01:48:27.258 --> 01:48:28.159]  Thanks for sharing that testimony.
[01:48:28.199 --> 01:48:29.019]  It may save other lives.
[01:48:29.059 --> 01:48:32.940]  But does your sister feel stupid now or is she emboldened?
[01:48:36.383 --> 01:48:36.823]  He's gone.
[01:48:37.963 --> 01:48:42.404]  A lot of folks, once they kill their family members inadvertently, they still won't admit their wrongs, they can't face the truth.
[01:48:42.724 --> 01:48:43.565]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[01:48:43.585 --> 01:48:46.785]  Alright, we're gonna come right back with Chelsea, husband's a funeral director.
[01:48:47.225 --> 01:48:48.226]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:48:48.786 --> 01:48:49.446]  It's official.
[01:48:51.006 --> 01:48:55.467]  World government with a world ID to control human activity has been announced.
[01:48:56.147 --> 01:48:58.528]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:49:00.652 --> 01:49:06.135]  See, they just want to slip in that, oh, your cell phone does listen to you, even when you don't want it to.
[01:49:06.715 --> 01:49:08.756]  Oh, that home assistant is watching and listening to you.
[01:49:08.796 --> 01:49:11.958]  And they are calling him now into court as a witness against you.
[01:49:12.018 --> 01:49:12.859]  Everything's being recorded.
[01:49:13.679 --> 01:49:16.100]  Oh, we do want to promote pedophilia.
[01:49:16.301 --> 01:49:18.122]  Oh, we do want to promote open borders and world government.
[01:49:18.842 --> 01:49:21.543]  And now the new article by Kit Daniels on InfoWars.com.
[01:49:22.364 --> 01:49:25.766]  I called Kit this morning and I said, Kit, you're an awesome writer, a great researcher.
[01:49:26.786 --> 01:49:28.427]  I said, I called him like 7 a.m.
[01:49:28.567 --> 01:49:29.208]  He picked up.
[01:49:29.288 --> 01:49:36.630]   I said, Kit, You notice, if you do a search, nobody's talking about the Big Davos announcement last week.
[01:49:37.290 --> 01:49:51.875]  All they're talking about is the announcement that if you want to travel, you'll have to give blood each time to a new testing system that puts you in a database that Bill Gates and George Soros own.
[01:49:51.895 --> 01:49:54.016]  I mean, that's not in the article, but that's who owns it.
[01:49:54.696 --> 01:49:56.277]  They go get the UN to approve it.
[01:49:56.297 --> 01:49:57.597]  The UN's now the world government.
[01:49:57.978 --> 01:49:59.138]  It says that that needs to happen.
[01:49:59.158 --> 01:50:01.719]  The corporations that implement what the UN says.
[01:50:04.855 --> 01:50:05.435]  Think about that.
[01:50:07.017 --> 01:50:12.321]  Since when does American Airlines or United Airlines or Delta get run by the UN?
[01:50:12.361 --> 01:50:13.502]  Well, since Congress lets them.
[01:50:14.823 --> 01:50:16.004]  Taking over our policy.
[01:50:18.486 --> 01:50:29.696]  But the media focused on the blood, not that the UN standardized, put out its guidelines matching what Davos has already created, and then the corporations roll out their new world ID.
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:37.300]   And it's in everybody's face. What is this we're putting on screen? I just don't know what this is.
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:44.659]   Oh, it's people protesting Southwest Airlines and trying to make them take the poison shots. And
[01:50:44.659 --> 01:50:48.739]   notice we're starting to win that fight because we stand up and take action. That's what it's
[01:50:48.739 --> 01:50:53.859]   all about. But getting back to what I was hitting on here, I'm gonna go back to your calls. It's
[01:50:53.859 --> 01:50:58.100]  just that this is, this is it.
[01:50:58.358 --> 01:50:59.279]  This is the enslavement.
[01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:00.240]  This is the surveillance.
[01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:01.401]  This is the control.
[01:51:01.461 --> 01:51:06.005]  And they admit, if we don't like what you do politically, we're going to just turn your phone off.
[01:51:06.025 --> 01:51:07.647]  We're going to turn your tracker system off.
[01:51:07.847 --> 01:51:09.048]  We're going to turn your chip off.
[01:51:09.268 --> 01:51:10.650]  We're going to turn your face scan off.
[01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:17.296]  And we're going to totally bankrupt you and then put you in a re-education camp.
[01:51:18.357 --> 01:51:20.499]  And they even use the term re-education camp.
[01:51:21.179 --> 01:51:21.720]  Don't believe me?
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:22.140]  Type in.
[01:51:23.251 --> 01:51:25.792]  Obama, Army document, re-education camp.
[01:51:26.052 --> 01:51:27.412]  It'll be on the Army's website.
[01:51:29.033 --> 01:51:37.035]  And they opened and have prepared re-education camps for Americans, even using the Soviet CHICOM term, re-education camp.
[01:51:37.275 --> 01:51:38.576]  That's a communist term!
[01:51:42.217 --> 01:51:44.578]  Army manual for re-education camps applies to U.S.
[01:51:44.618 --> 01:51:45.038]  citizens.
[01:51:45.078 --> 01:51:45.518]  There it is.
[01:51:46.778 --> 01:51:48.779]  He broke that in 2012, people couldn't believe it.
[01:51:50.009 --> 01:51:51.490]  The Army sent us that when it was secret.
[01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:53.170]  People thought we made a fake document.
[01:51:53.551 --> 01:51:55.792]  The Army just quietly released it 11 months later.
[01:51:58.793 --> 01:51:59.073]  Yeah.
[01:52:01.174 --> 01:52:03.555]  They didn't even care if I told people, as long as I didn't say who they were.
[01:52:03.575 --> 01:52:07.417]  I was given that by Army PSYOPs at Fort Hood.
[01:52:08.478 --> 01:52:10.879]  Because they built a re-education camp out there.
[01:52:11.219 --> 01:52:12.740]  Think they're a little pissed off about that?
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.340]  But those people are all long gone.
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.962]  They got woke people in the Army now, baby!
[01:52:17.402 --> 01:52:17.842]  Woo-hoo!
[01:52:17.882 --> 01:52:19.723]  They're ready to put you in a FEMA camp!
[01:52:22.085 --> 01:52:23.226]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[01:52:23.266 --> 01:52:24.187]  I apologize, I'm ranting.
[01:52:24.267 --> 01:52:25.588]  It's just such incredible news.
[01:52:25.688 --> 01:52:27.289]  Chelsea in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[01:52:27.329 --> 01:52:30.412]  Tell us about your husband, who's a funeral director, and what he's witnessing.
[01:52:32.373 --> 01:52:32.954]  Hey, yeah.
[01:52:33.014 --> 01:52:34.555]  Hey, Alex, nice to meet you over the phone.
[01:52:34.575 --> 01:52:35.476]  Thank you.
[01:52:36.777 --> 01:52:45.904]  Yeah, so my husband has been in the industry for a very long time, and the last, like, eight months has been extremely abnormal for the time of year.
[01:52:45.924 --> 01:52:50.328]  Usually in the warmer months, it's not older people that pass away.
[01:52:51.033 --> 01:52:53.214]  Younger, cuz they're outside, they're active, there's accidents.
[01:52:53.914 --> 01:53:03.858]  Well, we have seen probably a 60% increase in older people passing since, I'd say, April.
[01:53:04.759 --> 01:53:07.920]  And pretty much 95% of them are vaccinated.
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:18.244]  And if they're not vaccinated, and even if they didn't have COVID when they passed, they're required to put COVID on the death certificate.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:22.262]  Because the doctors know to sign off on it when it hits their desk.
[01:53:23.984 --> 01:53:40.795]  So, in the very beginning of all of this, he was told that unless it's a, well I say he, him as in like the whole funeral home as well, we're told that if it's not a homicide or like a blatant homicide or something like that, that they're required to put COVID as the cause of death.
[01:53:41.556 --> 01:53:43.257]  So that's been going on since the beginning.
[01:53:44.218 --> 01:53:51.574]  But then this summer, like I said, he has seen probably a 60% increase in the ages of like 60 to 75 people passing.
[01:53:55.151 --> 01:53:59.094]  Well, ma'am, I would like you, if you don't mind, to get your name and number off air.
[01:53:59.134 --> 01:54:05.239]  We won't say who your husband is, but I'd like to, I believe you, but we do this as journalists when we do interviews.
[01:54:05.559 --> 01:54:13.686]  Verify where he works, what he does, and then have him on incognito, like Project Veritas would do, to talk about what he witnesses or what he sees.
[01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:16.668]  Now, if he's the owner, he might want to say his name, but that's up to him.
[01:54:17.029 --> 01:54:24.701]   But this is exactly what the German epidemiology Society came out and said, but also not just the epidemiology,
[01:54:24.701 --> 01:54:30.302]   then their other big union came out, the Coroner's Union or the Pathologist Union.
[01:54:30.302 --> 01:54:35.302]   And similar things with large national unions in Japan came out and said the same thing.
[01:54:35.302 --> 01:54:41.302]   So yeah, Grand County Coroner raises concerns over deaths among COVID cases.
[01:54:41.302 --> 01:54:46.762]   And yeah, I know a lot of medical doctors personally that are quitting at hospitals and places they work and going
[01:54:46.762 --> 01:54:48.302]  and starting their own clinics.
[01:54:48.302 --> 01:54:51.302]   But they're not ready to go public until they've got their new clinic started.
[01:54:51.302 --> 01:54:56.661]   Then they're going to go public as they make them sign non-disclosures where they're told we know the shots are killing a bunch of
[01:54:56.661 --> 01:54:57.302]  people.
[01:54:57.302 --> 01:55:00.302]  It's like the Project Veritas nurses and doctors showed.
[01:55:00.302 --> 01:55:03.302]   We're not going to tell people it's COVID vaccine killing them.
[01:55:03.302 --> 01:55:04.302]  We're going to tell them it's COVID.
[01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:13.315]   And so yeah, and the hospitals are being recorded by the managers Who are just corporate operatives to not tell people.
[01:55:13.355 --> 01:55:15.556]  So they're now getting you involved in the killing.
[01:55:15.616 --> 01:55:16.296]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:55:16.536 --> 01:55:18.037]  What else does your husband say about this?
[01:55:19.797 --> 01:55:22.999]  So he, basically it's just, it's unlike anything he's ever seen.
[01:55:23.019 --> 01:55:25.239]  He's been in the industry for almost 20 years now.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.681]  Started out like as an apprentice at 19 years old.
[01:55:28.701 --> 01:55:31.462]  So it's just, it's unlike anything he's seen.
[01:55:31.522 --> 01:55:32.362]  It's a lot of lying.
[01:55:32.462 --> 01:55:37.044]  He's even felt like, you know, the company he works for has kind of called him to be somewhat unethical.
[01:55:38.662 --> 01:55:43.144]  Thankfully, they're not mandating the vaccine, because I think they're seeing what's happening.
[01:55:43.164 --> 01:55:51.847]  So they're not mandating on their employees, but they're still requiring their employees to follow the procedures and protocols that we know to be unethical.
[01:55:52.047 --> 01:55:55.348]  He had a family a little over a year ago.
[01:55:55.368 --> 01:55:57.309]  The gentleman committed suicide.
[01:55:58.109 --> 01:56:04.371]  He did have COVID at the time of the suicide, and my husband was required to put down COVID as the cause of death.
[01:56:05.303 --> 01:56:09.165]  Similar thing, he had a family where the person died in a car accident.
[01:56:10.065 --> 01:56:12.246]  COVID, he had to put COVID down as the cause of death.
[01:56:13.466 --> 01:56:15.207]  So it's just, it's crazy.
[01:56:15.247 --> 01:56:16.768]  He's been saying it since the beginning of it.
[01:56:17.208 --> 01:56:20.989]  The numbers are so far skewed, it's not even, it's not even funny.
[01:56:22.710 --> 01:56:29.852]  One lady, she was like in her 80s, she had cancer, had COVID, survived it, passed away six months later.
[01:56:30.473 --> 01:56:32.053]  What do you think they put down as the cause of death?
[01:56:32.794 --> 01:56:33.074]  COVID.
[01:56:34.241 --> 01:57:09.924]   So it's just it's unlike anything I've ever seen he's ever he's ever seen before um and just like you said it's causing people to want to get out of the industries they're in especially you know if they're Christians and want to do the right thing and that's kind of where he's at um I even have a friend who's a nurse in in Nashville and she's about to quit her job she's on maternity leave now but when she gets done she's quitting because she flat out told me they're killing people at the hospital she works at so it's Well, they call it uncommon.
[01:57:09.944 --> 01:57:16.626]  I personally know it's more than 50 people that have lost loved ones, young and old, after they took the shots.
[01:57:16.686 --> 01:57:19.107]  It's always blood clots, heart attacks, cancers.
[01:57:19.127 --> 01:57:24.489]  And then I know hundreds of people whose themselves are family, like Roger Stone's wife.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.161]  Took the Pfizer shot, took the second one, and three weeks later got a big tumor under her arm.
[01:57:30.821 --> 01:57:32.301]  And they said, yeah, it's the vaccine.
[01:57:32.361 --> 01:57:34.402]  I mean, this is not a vaccine.
[01:57:34.422 --> 01:57:36.842]  This is a death shot, as Dr. Zelenko says.
[01:57:37.662 --> 01:57:38.603]  Well, ma'am, God bless you.
[01:57:38.623 --> 01:57:39.583]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:57:40.983 --> 01:57:45.064]  And if you'd like to get us in contact with your husband off record, we'd love to interview him on air.
[01:57:45.084 --> 01:57:54.009]   We won't say where you're from or where you're at, but we'd like you to, you know, talk to Rob Dewar, one of the crew members here, and, you know, you know, call us with a FaceTime or something and, you
[01:57:54.009 --> 01:57:57.679]   know, show us your ID or something so we can, you know, see that you are who you are so we can say, "Hey,
[01:57:57.679 --> 01:58:03.029]   we have a fellow that runs a funeral home on an embalmer," or
[01:58:03.029 --> 01:58:09.349]   whatever you call them technically, so that they could, an undertaker, have your undertaker
[01:58:09.349 --> 01:58:10.139]  husband on.
[01:58:10.275 --> 01:58:12.116]  That's an important job and a hard job.
[01:58:12.136 --> 01:58:12.796]  We appreciate him.
[01:58:13.176 --> 01:58:14.837]  All right, we'll be right back with more calls.
[01:58:14.877 --> 01:58:16.918]  A bunch of other crazy stuff they want to bring up.
[01:58:17.339 --> 01:58:18.659]  Big Brother doesn't want this heard.
[01:58:18.679 --> 01:58:19.900]  They hate this show existing.
[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:22.101]  They're hopping mad because it gives you a voice.
[01:58:23.002 --> 01:58:24.643]  All right, I'm going to host someone in the next hour.
[01:58:24.683 --> 01:58:25.783]  The Joe Salendi takes over.
[01:58:25.803 --> 01:58:26.904]  We've had incredible callers.
[01:58:26.964 --> 01:58:28.044]  I'm sure we've got more to come.
[01:58:28.064 --> 01:58:32.627]  I'm going to try to race through your calls as quickly as I can now to get to everybody that's on the board.
[01:58:34.670 --> 01:58:36.871]  And then, of course, the war room's coming up at 3 p.m.
[01:58:36.911 --> 01:58:42.775]  Central today, three more hours of guests and calls and time to really talk about things and get your testimony out there to millions of people.
[01:58:43.235 --> 01:58:45.076]  Believe me, you're having a big effect doing that.
[01:58:45.096 --> 01:58:52.900]  And a lot of times I feel even dirty just being on air talking about all this evil, when at a certain point I'm like, we better march on these folks.
[01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:57.703]  But you got a bunch of dumbed-down people in the bureaucracy, they'll think we're attacking them.
[01:58:57.823 --> 01:59:01.906]  They're not educated on the globalist takeover, and how these corporations control our government yet.
[01:59:02.697 --> 01:59:06.480]  And so we've got to get the public educated before we can bring these globalists to justice.
[01:59:07.501 --> 01:59:14.327]  And as bad as I feel just talking about it and just protesting and you know the rest of it and I follow a lot of lawsuits on the globalists and ads of success.
[01:59:16.189 --> 01:59:21.874]  Imagine the other people that know this and decide to not even talk or not even call in or not even warn anybody.
[01:59:22.615 --> 01:59:24.977]  The bottom line is they're pissed because of therapeutics.
[01:59:25.137 --> 01:59:34.229]   You've been telling people about zinc and D3 and Vitamin C and iodine and all these things that boost your immune system.
[01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:36.810]  You've been telling folks about ivermectin and all these things.
[01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:40.432]  That's why they're so angry, because they're not able to get the death toll they wanted.
[01:59:41.592 --> 01:59:43.753]  They're just getting the death toll from their poison shots.
[01:59:44.333 --> 01:59:46.494]  It's a very, very incredible time to be alive right now.
[01:59:47.455 --> 01:59:52.177]  But believe me, you calling and telling your stories about how you lost loved ones and things, that's waking people up.
[01:59:52.237 --> 01:59:53.257]  That's changing the narrative.
[01:59:53.277 --> 01:59:59.995]   So thank you for taking something evil, and like God does through you, Transmuting good out of that evil.
[02:00:00.736 --> 02:00:01.456]  That's what God does.
[02:00:01.556 --> 02:00:02.717]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[02:00:03.158 --> 02:00:04.378]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:00:04.438 --> 02:00:05.719]  Is it Controlled Demolition?
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:07.901]  Or is it Info Warrior?
[02:00:08.041 --> 02:00:09.382]  It's Controlled Demolition.
[02:00:09.762 --> 02:00:10.783]  You're on the air, welcome.
[02:00:11.604 --> 02:00:12.825]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:00:12.865 --> 02:00:13.605]  God bless you!
[02:00:14.045 --> 02:00:15.086]  We love you so much!
[02:00:15.426 --> 02:00:15.827]  Love you too.
[02:00:17.268 --> 02:00:32.512]   Hey listen man, we went to a taping of the Mike Huckabee Show recently here in Tennessee, and it was a great show, but He had a lieutenant governor on that was from Arkansas, and they were talking about their opinion on the vaccination.
[02:00:33.512 --> 02:00:39.995]  And Mike Huckabee said, well, you know, I went ahead and got the vaccination because that's what my doctor recommended.
[02:00:42.236 --> 02:00:49.260]  But then before that, he was challenging Dr. Fauci on, you know, he was bringing up points about not to listen to Dr. Fauci.
[02:00:50.228 --> 02:00:57.691]  I just thought it was incredible that, you know, just like Rand Paul, he can't just come out against it and just stand up like you've been doing the whole time.
[02:00:59.012 --> 02:01:02.913]  Well, look, Huckabee is very well spoken and comes off as a great guy.
[02:01:02.933 --> 02:01:05.554]  And I know my friend Chuck Norris loves him and says he's the best guy ever.
[02:01:06.094 --> 02:01:08.656]  But Huckabee was even for forced inoculations of children.
[02:01:09.156 --> 02:01:11.677]  They still buy into the medical system and trust the doctors.
[02:01:11.817 --> 02:01:16.899]   It's not doctors making the decisions, it's Bill Gates and the UN and the globalists.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:25.125]  And so Trump made the same mistake of trusting the system, not realizing that it's that bad, or trusting Milley and thinking the Pentagon leaders are patriots.
[02:01:25.185 --> 02:01:25.685]  They're not.
[02:01:26.226 --> 02:01:28.187]  The bad guys have been put in all the major positions.
[02:01:28.227 --> 02:01:28.867]  Here's an example.
[02:01:29.368 --> 02:01:30.108]  This just came out.
[02:01:30.188 --> 02:01:36.933]  John Roberts slammed for deleting tweet claiming death of Colin Powell raised new concerns about vaccines.
[02:01:36.973 --> 02:01:37.433]  Well, yeah.
[02:01:37.733 --> 02:01:40.095]  How do you die of COVID if the vaccine doesn't work?
[02:01:40.575 --> 02:01:42.116]  Or did the vaccine kill him?
[02:01:42.917 --> 02:01:44.338]  Which we already know it's linked to.
[02:01:45.478 --> 02:01:48.680]  So, then he gets scared and deletes that, and now he's under fire for that.
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:51.561]  Because you're not supposed to criticize the shots.
[02:01:52.141 --> 02:01:54.182]  God bless you, thanks for the call, Control Demolition.
[02:01:54.542 --> 02:01:56.263]  InfoWarrior in Washington, welcome.
[02:01:59.025 --> 02:02:06.308]  If you go on Amazon right now, you can get your very own blowho- or excuse me, bullhorn for $50.
[02:02:07.048 --> 02:02:10.310]  You can go out on the street, and you can tell people these stories.
[02:02:11.050 --> 02:02:13.051]  Don't aggressively yell at people.
[02:02:13.692 --> 02:02:15.813]  Tell them that your parents just died.
[02:02:16.434 --> 02:02:17.094]  Cry.
[02:02:17.554 --> 02:02:18.635]  They will listen.
[02:02:18.935 --> 02:02:26.060]  You will have a crowd of a hundred people right in your grocery store if you tell them your parents just died.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.601]  If you have a blow horn.
[02:02:27.621 --> 02:02:34.045]  I totally agree and you know that's something we should sell because that's something listeners always and we need to be able to sell things to stay on air.
[02:02:34.765 --> 02:02:39.448]  Is we could buy in mass really good brands of bullhorns, but they're all made in China.
[02:02:39.468 --> 02:02:39.909]  I'm sorry.
[02:02:40.309 --> 02:02:44.111]  I've even bought bullhorns that are made like in America and they cost twice as much.
[02:02:44.592 --> 02:02:46.933]  I bought one that isn't as good as the ones made in China.
[02:02:47.294 --> 02:02:50.896]  Cost me 300 bucks versus a $50 one from China.
[02:02:50.936 --> 02:02:52.757]  But some things just aren't made here.
[02:02:52.797 --> 02:02:55.279]  But yes, everybody should get bullhorns.
[02:02:55.319 --> 02:02:58.841]  They should get loud ones and they should go out and educate people.
[02:02:58.922 --> 02:02:59.402]  Absolutely.
[02:03:00.259 --> 02:03:04.325]  Yes, please listen to me, because this is the year of the blowhorn.
[02:03:04.605 --> 02:03:07.850]  Because if it isn't, next year is the year of the gun.
[02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:12.858]  And you know they have taken jobs from everyone.
[02:03:14.039 --> 02:03:15.682]  Christmas is going to be hard.
[02:03:16.391 --> 02:03:18.132]  You wait till January comes.
[02:03:18.512 --> 02:03:30.016]  When 3% of Americans finally stand up, it is going to be devastating, and they will not have blowhorns, and they will not cry.
[02:03:31.056 --> 02:03:31.556]  Please.
[02:03:32.257 --> 02:03:34.778]  It is the year of the bullhorn now.
[02:03:34.838 --> 02:03:36.278]  You're right, it's the year of the bullhorn.
[02:03:36.338 --> 02:03:37.139]  I appreciate you.
[02:03:37.539 --> 02:03:38.199]  God bless you.
[02:03:38.319 --> 02:03:39.180]  And that's a great point.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:50.785]  If we won't activist now, if we won't get in the streets now, if we won't speak up now, if we won't picket now, if we won't do banner hangs now, if we won't call the talk radio now, if we won't go to the statehouse now, if we won't protest now...
[02:03:51.505 --> 02:03:52.146]  We never will.
[02:03:52.206 --> 02:03:53.948]  That's why they're demonizing January 6th.
[02:03:54.388 --> 02:03:58.393]  So they're making such a big deal about it and exaggerating it and calling it the worst thing in U.S.
[02:03:58.413 --> 02:04:02.277]  history and other preposterous crap is they're scared of us marching peacefully.
[02:04:03.359 --> 02:04:10.967]  They want to demonize the million people that showed up peacefully using the few hundred that were violent and the few hundred others that got waved in by police.
[02:04:11.268 --> 02:04:14.858]   And that video We'll be on the war room today.
[02:04:15.038 --> 02:04:15.879]  It's 40 minutes.
[02:04:15.939 --> 02:04:17.561]  It just came out on one of the court cases.
[02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:22.526]  They've got, you've heard 12,000 hours of footage from the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cameras in there from that day.
[02:04:23.467 --> 02:04:26.550]  They just released 40 something minutes and I was watching it during the break.
[02:04:26.991 --> 02:04:29.854]  It's police opening doors for people and waving them in.
[02:04:31.570 --> 02:04:35.053]  New Capitol video contradicts Justice Department's media narrative on January 6th.
[02:04:35.693 --> 02:04:39.817]  We're getting that article up on InfoWars.com, but it is incredible.
[02:04:40.597 --> 02:04:43.119]  And I mean, I was looking at 40 minutes of it, just scanning through it.
[02:04:43.139 --> 02:04:46.222]  It was just like them waving them in, them opening the doors, them telling them to go in.
[02:04:46.642 --> 02:04:50.265]  And these are people charged who just didn't even know what was going on.
[02:04:50.345 --> 02:04:52.987]  Others broke in, then they ordered the police to stand down.
[02:04:53.448 --> 02:04:54.549]  They walk in peacefully.
[02:04:56.403 --> 02:04:57.944]  And this is just some of the footage.
[02:04:57.964 --> 02:05:00.466]  Some of the footage I saw is them opening the doors for them.
[02:05:00.586 --> 02:05:01.487]  I mean, wow!
[02:05:01.607 --> 02:05:04.029]  And some of these people are still in jail!
[02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:12.695]  When Democrats burned down buildings and then the Vice President, when she was running, bailed people out that burned down buildings and beat people.
[02:05:13.696 --> 02:05:16.298]  She bailed them out and the charges were dropped by the Justice Department.
[02:05:17.359 --> 02:05:22.883]  Two billion dollars in damages, but people that were waived in by police are still in jail nine months later.
[02:05:24.591 --> 02:05:25.732]  Good Lord!
[02:05:26.432 --> 02:05:28.773]  Alright, let's jam in another caller here.
[02:05:30.073 --> 02:05:30.954]  Who is up next?
[02:05:30.994 --> 02:05:35.976]  Let's talk to... Let's talk to David in Alabama.
[02:05:36.016 --> 02:05:36.716]  David, you're on the air.
[02:05:36.756 --> 02:05:37.256]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:05:37.437 --> 02:05:38.377]  And then I'll go to Yim.
[02:05:38.397 --> 02:05:39.778]  Hello, Alex.
[02:05:39.818 --> 02:05:40.718]  How are you doing today?
[02:05:40.758 --> 02:05:40.878]  Good.
[02:05:41.938 --> 02:05:45.480]  Well, I'm calling because I'm a pretty private individual.
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:46.681]  Well-educated.
[02:05:47.241 --> 02:05:47.681]  Old man.
[02:05:48.376 --> 02:06:00.543]  But I've been doing a lot of research on NATO, because in the month of July, August, NATO established its first ever command center on U.S.
[02:06:00.663 --> 02:06:02.585]  soil in Virginia.
[02:06:04.166 --> 02:06:16.373]  In the midst of all that's going on, NATO comes over here and supposedly has a joint operation with the reconfirmed Second Navy.
[02:06:17.645 --> 02:06:19.086]  That just came back out.
[02:06:20.367 --> 02:06:24.250]  And you can find some delightful information about it.
[02:06:24.730 --> 02:06:31.115]  It's NATO O-10 Science and Technology Trends 2020 to 2040.
[02:06:32.576 --> 02:06:34.797]  And it will scare the living hell out of you.
[02:06:36.679 --> 02:06:41.922]  It goes anything from biochemical to augmenting the body.
[02:06:43.383 --> 02:06:51.720]   And I will give you one page of statement Give me just one second.
[02:06:51.760 --> 02:06:52.120]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:52.661 --> 02:06:54.362]  And do me a huge favor, David.
[02:06:54.562 --> 02:06:56.363]  Will you turn your radio down or off?
[02:06:56.403 --> 02:07:02.728]  Because I want people to be able to hear you.
[02:07:02.808 --> 02:07:03.188]  Sure.
[02:07:03.228 --> 02:07:03.789]  All right.
[02:07:03.829 --> 02:07:25.429]   And on page 103, it specifically states, and this is what got me, is interfacing these devices with biological systems will offer new treatment methods for neurological diseases But it will improve interface mechanism between the brain and electronic devices for better control.
[02:07:26.509 --> 02:07:26.869]  That's right.
[02:07:26.889 --> 02:07:29.331]  In fact, sir, I meant to get to this today and I'm glad you called.
[02:07:29.371 --> 02:07:30.191]  I get so busy I didn't.
[02:07:30.211 --> 02:07:31.652]  I'm going to shoot a special report on this.
[02:07:32.092 --> 02:07:33.333]  I promise because it's so important.
[02:07:33.913 --> 02:07:38.836]  I was always told by the top experts and even people that have been inside the British government, the U.S.
[02:07:38.856 --> 02:07:42.698]  government, the highest levels that NATO is going to be the head of the world government.
[02:07:43.145 --> 02:07:49.545]   NATO runs the child kidnapping, NATO runs the drugs, and NATO runs the UN, and NATO's behind the UN,
[02:07:49.545 --> 02:07:54.904]   and NATO is what's already taken over the US and ran the coup, and ran the coup against Trump,
[02:07:54.904 --> 02:08:01.065]   and ran the election fraud. And so really the only power centers now is NATO, China, and Russia.
[02:08:01.065 --> 02:08:05.145]   Those are the three power structures now. America's basically, in the eyes of the globalists,
[02:08:05.145 --> 02:08:09.625]   is conquered and is done. They're down just bankrupting us and mopping us up in their views.
[02:08:10.746 --> 02:08:14.024]  I would agree with that. I would definitely agree with that.
[02:08:13.838 --> 02:08:14.459]  But you know what?
[02:08:14.999 --> 02:08:21.321]  NATO's here because it even talks about, on places of crisis, where they will go and what they will do.
[02:08:21.561 --> 02:08:22.001]  Absolutely.
[02:08:22.061 --> 02:08:23.422]  I mean, it's going to be not U.N.
[02:08:23.442 --> 02:08:25.662]  troops that take over America, but NATO troops.
[02:08:26.643 --> 02:08:28.083]   And the U.N.' 's in charge of everything else.
[02:08:28.143 --> 02:08:28.623]  God bless you.
[02:08:28.663 --> 02:08:29.244]  Powerful call.
[02:08:29.264 --> 02:08:30.164]  Glad he held for that.
[02:08:30.604 --> 02:08:31.064]  All right.
[02:08:31.745 --> 02:08:32.725]  I'm getting to everybody.
[02:08:33.685 --> 02:08:39.327]  I'm getting to John in California, Tim in Washington and others straight ahead.
[02:08:39.927 --> 02:08:41.108]  And then Gerald Solente.
[02:08:41.148 --> 02:08:41.628]  Stay with us.
[02:08:43.106 --> 02:08:46.350]  It's a corporate takeover of America, of the world.
[02:08:49.134 --> 02:08:52.138]  And yeah, here it is, Norfolk's NATO home in North America.
[02:08:52.478 --> 02:08:56.524]  And it's all right there about putting ships in our brains, controlling us, all of it.
[02:08:57.659 --> 02:09:07.201]  See, it's NATO that basically ran Germany and all of those giant child kidnapping rings and 30,000 kids in one city alone, given to sex rapists to create the new love.
[02:09:07.221 --> 02:09:11.362]  I mean, it's just a satanic group of the worst scum you could ever imagine in your life that run it.
[02:09:11.402 --> 02:09:15.763]  It doesn't mean the troops in NATO from the... They're the enemy!
[02:09:16.343 --> 02:09:19.424]  They hate the troops of Germany and France and Spain and the UK.
[02:09:19.784 --> 02:09:21.604]  They hate the good men and women.
[02:09:21.984 --> 02:09:24.905]  They are in control of all of our institutions.
[02:09:26.536 --> 02:09:28.337]  And NATO runs the whole show.
[02:09:28.817 --> 02:09:32.619]  It comes out with the UN, the sex trafficking to kidnap women.
[02:09:32.919 --> 02:09:35.620]  They kidnap hundreds of thousands of people out of the Balkans.
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:37.881]  So does the UN.
[02:09:37.901 --> 02:09:41.822]  They are the diplomatic immunity bad guys.
[02:09:43.863 --> 02:09:45.464]  Now they're coming for you and your family.
[02:09:46.244 --> 02:09:55.981]   With their world ID and carbon tax via the social credit score implemented through The platform known as the Vaccine Passport is now officially announced.
[02:09:56.481 --> 02:10:00.503]  Let's go ahead and take a call here from John in California.
[02:10:00.543 --> 02:10:01.523]  Go ahead and we'll go to Tim.
[02:10:02.944 --> 02:10:03.504]  Hello, Alex.
[02:10:03.744 --> 02:10:04.044]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:04.905 --> 02:10:08.046]  Thank you for injecting God into your daily broadcast, first of all.
[02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:08.786]  Thank you.
[02:10:08.966 --> 02:10:14.809]  And I might submit that for those listening that recognize what I'm saying, the rosary is quite a powerful tool.
[02:10:15.529 --> 02:10:21.286]   Also, I'm going to get right back down to what, let's say Alex, you had a A time machine.
[02:10:21.326 --> 02:10:23.108]  You can go back to about 1925.
[02:10:23.188 --> 02:10:27.570]  Let's forget about now or stall anything for now and just focus on our buddy Hitler.
[02:10:28.971 --> 02:10:31.973]  Now, I guess what I'm getting at, I'm pretty upset.
[02:10:32.173 --> 02:10:36.075]  So, what's been happening is everybody wants to talk about, you know, praying, which is great.
[02:10:36.115 --> 02:10:38.497]  People want to talk about, you know, bullhorning, which is great.
[02:10:38.917 --> 02:10:41.198]  We've all been talking for about two years now about it.
[02:10:41.478 --> 02:10:44.240]  You've been talking for, I've been listening for about 15 years, first time caller.
[02:10:45.805 --> 02:10:47.526]  And I'm kind of tired of it.
[02:10:47.806 --> 02:10:56.170]  So, not of you, but I'm tired of everybody just thinking that we're going to go ahead and, you know, a parade of flags and everything's going to change it.
[02:10:56.190 --> 02:10:58.071]  This is the devil that we're fighting against.
[02:10:58.631 --> 02:11:02.493]  So, again, the time machine, we're going to go back to 1925.
[02:11:02.533 --> 02:11:03.714]  We're going to find the dragon.
[02:11:04.034 --> 02:11:04.554]  What would we do?
[02:11:04.674 --> 02:11:05.394]  Chop the head off?
[02:11:05.454 --> 02:11:11.237]  Or do you think that we'd have, you know, flags and marching and, you know, religious talk?
[02:11:13.047 --> 02:11:14.968]  Finally, where are the Black Ops guys?
[02:11:15.048 --> 02:11:16.749]  Where are the Green Berets?
[02:11:16.829 --> 02:11:19.791]  Where are all the guys that are, you know, with the balls?
[02:11:20.852 --> 02:11:23.513]  How many people do you think that there are running this whole situation, Alex?
[02:11:23.533 --> 02:11:24.174]  50 people?
[02:11:24.254 --> 02:11:24.174]  100?
[02:11:24.594 --> 02:11:24.914]  Really?
[02:11:25.415 --> 02:11:25.875]  About that?
[02:11:25.895 --> 02:11:27.776]  Well, absolutely.
[02:11:27.815 --> 02:11:36.914]   I mean, I'll tell you that the media sells the idea in Hollywood that soldiers and even
[02:11:36.914 --> 02:11:39.914]  your non-commissioned officers and officers run things.
[02:11:39.914 --> 02:11:41.295]  Colonels don't run anything.
[02:11:41.295 --> 02:11:42.994]  Regular generals don't run anything.
[02:11:42.994 --> 02:11:46.854]  It's all the bureaucrats above it and the policy makers.
[02:11:46.854 --> 02:11:52.215]   And the UN and these world councils, like the CFR, the Royal Commissions, all those,
[02:11:52.215 --> 02:11:54.694]  they create the policy and then it's implemented.
[02:11:54.694 --> 02:11:57.975]  That's why you read one NATO document, you read the rest.
[02:11:57.975 --> 02:11:58.836]  It's all the same thing.
[02:11:59.116 --> 02:12:06.899]  We're going to put chips in your brain, we're going to take you over, we're going to dominate you and control you, and we're going to use everybody as assets of this new system.
[02:12:06.979 --> 02:12:10.300]  I mean, they literally say, we are capturing your country.
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:12.121]  You will no longer have any authority.
[02:12:12.161 --> 02:12:12.941]  You will own nothing.
[02:12:12.981 --> 02:12:13.681]  You will have nothing.
[02:12:14.361 --> 02:12:16.482]  So it's a declaration of total war.
[02:12:17.062 --> 02:12:23.605]  And if you go along with it as an executive, you get the mansion, you get the Mercedes Benz, you can play golf all day.
[02:12:25.004 --> 02:12:25.925]  So where are these guys?
[02:12:26.085 --> 02:12:28.247]  Why can't someone secretly go chop the head off?
[02:12:28.467 --> 02:12:35.473]  Well, I mean, you know, there's not a lot of people that are motivated to do things like that.
[02:12:35.693 --> 02:12:37.855]  And first, you got to identify these people.
[02:12:37.915 --> 02:12:38.996]  And I'm not calling for any violence.
[02:12:39.616 --> 02:12:40.978]  I've snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[02:12:41.578 --> 02:12:42.699]  Most people there aren't bad.
[02:12:42.799 --> 02:12:45.902]  Most of them are just people being indoctrinated and brought into the occult.
[02:12:45.942 --> 02:12:48.432]   It's very, you know, Incremental.
[02:12:50.414 --> 02:12:51.814]  I've snuck in and covered Bilderberg.
[02:12:51.834 --> 02:12:54.596]  I've been in the building when it's already going and they've caught me and thrown me out.
[02:12:55.356 --> 02:12:56.677]  When the King of Spain's walking by.
[02:12:57.338 --> 02:13:00.720]  It was guarded by Marines and Secret Service.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:03.802]  So even if I wanted to do something, it wouldn't have gone well.
[02:13:03.842 --> 02:13:05.202]  What, I've been able to take one of them out?
[02:13:05.423 --> 02:13:06.243]  I wouldn't do that, by the way.
[02:13:06.263 --> 02:13:07.664]  I was there as a journalist.
[02:13:08.224 --> 02:13:10.165]  But this is real stuff to talk about.
[02:13:11.906 --> 02:13:14.007]  We need somebody else to go out and take somebody out.
[02:13:14.107 --> 02:13:15.147]  We need to expose it.
[02:13:15.447 --> 02:13:17.087]  It's a spiritual issue we have to deal with.
[02:13:17.327 --> 02:13:21.848]  We have to politically then take back our systems and then fix it that way and prosecute these people.
[02:13:22.248 --> 02:13:30.711]  Well, there's some great footage up on InfoWars.com that I'm not going to have time to get to here because I want to go to your calls, hit some final news before Gerald Salente takes over.
[02:13:30.751 --> 02:13:36.032]  But I bet it's going to be on The War Room today with Owen Schroer, former New York Times writer.
[02:13:36.972 --> 02:13:44.459]  Bari Weiss confronts Brian Stelter over CNN's COVID lab leak coverage, Hunter Biden's laptop, and more.
[02:13:44.659 --> 02:13:44.979]  Yes!
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:55.449]  You see, this is a critical point we've reached that I talked some about on the Saturday emergency broadcast and I talked some about on the regular Sunday show yesterday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:13:56.870 --> 02:14:02.748]   There comes a time when Joe Rogan Was a good guy, but he couldn't believe it was this evil.
[02:14:03.248 --> 02:14:07.149]  Then he found out he got even more popular telling the truth, and now he's full red-pilled.
[02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:09.370]  Now Dave Chappelle's becoming red-pilled.
[02:14:09.730 --> 02:14:12.751]  Now Tucker Carlson's super red-pilled, and red-pilling others.
[02:14:12.791 --> 02:14:13.632]  He's more black-pilled.
[02:14:14.672 --> 02:14:17.873]  I'm kind of that way too, but I'm also white-pilled at the end of the day.
[02:14:17.893 --> 02:14:21.434]  I don't know if that means optimistic as a guy, but I'm very black-pilled about the current situation.
[02:14:21.874 --> 02:14:24.975]  But red-pilling is the key so people can see the black pill and the white pill.
[02:14:25.896 --> 02:14:32.863]   So, As it all comes out, people now know no one watches Brian Stelter.
[02:14:33.783 --> 02:14:39.586]  But if you go on Brian Stelter's show and attack him and say he's scum, suddenly it gets 50 million views.
[02:14:40.206 --> 02:14:42.287]  Just like I did when I attacked Pierce Morgan.
[02:14:42.928 --> 02:14:44.409]  So people want the truth.
[02:14:44.449 --> 02:14:45.369]  People want truth.
[02:14:45.829 --> 02:14:46.970]  They know it's all a fraud.
[02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:52.092]  So Fauci came out and said, anybody that questions me is a conspiracy terrorist.
[02:14:52.112 --> 02:14:52.553]  Well, that's from 19...
[02:14:54.849 --> 02:14:57.510]  63.
[02:14:55.630 --> 02:14:57.510]  No one believed that Kennedy was killed.
[02:14:57.550 --> 02:15:09.676]  And by 64, the CIA put a memo out, declassified in 77, by the Church Committee, Senator Church Committee, and said, anybody questioning JFK, don't argue the facts, don't get into that, just say they're a conspiracy terrorist.
[02:15:10.458 --> 02:15:14.360]  And so Fauci says, people that don't believe me just don't know the facts.
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:17.582]  I'm 100% right, they're 100% wrong.
[02:15:18.042 --> 02:15:20.863]  They just, 99% of the deaths are unvaccinated.
[02:15:21.143 --> 02:15:24.025]  Totally made up, never gives a statistic where it came from.
[02:15:25.466 --> 02:15:27.387]  It's pure crap.
[02:15:29.248 --> 02:15:33.690]  But he knows he's talking to an audience that wants to be lied to, which is a very small audience.
[02:15:33.730 --> 02:15:38.612]  That's why a lot of people, even John Oliver was out interviewing people, they're like, have you ever heard of Fauci?
[02:15:38.732 --> 02:15:39.333]  No, who's he?
[02:15:42.568 --> 02:15:44.549]  Because people don't watch that lying criminal.
[02:15:45.949 --> 02:15:50.752]  And the globalists have already figured that out, so that's why they launched the COVID hoax, trying to get us back under their control.
[02:15:50.812 --> 02:15:51.652]  That's a good video.
[02:15:53.413 --> 02:15:54.433]  There's so much more now.
[02:15:54.793 --> 02:15:56.154]  Economists warn, stock up now.
[02:15:56.194 --> 02:15:57.975]  Inflation could get very, very ugly.
[02:15:58.295 --> 02:16:02.537]  I've been telling you that for years, but I told you that 21 months ago.
[02:16:02.577 --> 02:16:03.777]  I said, get storable foods.
[02:16:03.797 --> 02:16:06.538]  There's going to be supply chain breakdown by next year.
[02:16:07.339 --> 02:16:09.840]  And I said, I expect Christmas, they'll say it's canceled.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:11.261]  I know how they operate.
[02:16:11.381 --> 02:16:11.901]  I said that.
[02:16:13.308 --> 02:16:14.028]  Twenty months ago.
[02:16:15.449 --> 02:16:19.190]  And I told you food prices would explode on us because it's their damn plan!
[02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:26.233]  So yes, get high quality storable foods, get them delivered to you now, very high quality, the lowest price you're going to find on food this good.
[02:16:27.114 --> 02:16:31.135]  Infowarsstore.com or preparewithalex.com takes you right to the sub page.
[02:16:32.116 --> 02:16:35.517]  The full catalog of my Patriot Supply, the lowest price you're going to find on anywhere.
[02:16:35.537 --> 02:16:37.058]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:39.298 --> 02:16:39.918]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:16:40.318 --> 02:16:43.340]  We can take your orders over the phone.
[02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:46.060]  We also carry Judge Joe Brown's barbecue sauce.
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:46.841]  It's delicious.
[02:16:47.821 --> 02:16:49.602]  And so we carry that great stuff as well.
[02:16:49.622 --> 02:16:52.083]  I don't know why the bottle example we have is only 90% full.
[02:16:52.103 --> 02:16:58.805]  It's actually almost completely full in the real Judge Joe Brown bottles, but somebody must have had some of that Judge Joe Brown sauce.
[02:16:58.825 --> 02:16:59.705]  100% reviews.
[02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:01.206]  I'm gonna get him back on the show.
[02:17:01.626 --> 02:17:02.046]  We love him.
[02:17:03.067 --> 02:17:08.760]   Okay, ladies and gentlemen, again, This is the last day.
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:10.160]  It's ending today.
[02:17:10.641 --> 02:17:12.722]  I'm going to go do new specials as soon as I get off air.
[02:17:12.742 --> 02:17:18.846]  I'm going to go talk about what products we've got to put on special because people are habituated to only buying stuff on special, which is catch 22.
[02:17:19.626 --> 02:17:20.727]  Now supply chain breakdowns.
[02:17:20.767 --> 02:17:21.767]  You can't get enough of the product.
[02:17:21.927 --> 02:17:23.068]  You only buy it when I discount it.
[02:17:23.608 --> 02:17:25.129]  And so that's fine.
[02:17:25.189 --> 02:17:26.630]  DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:29.712]  It's what I would be doing for my immune system when you're doing everything else.
[02:17:30.092 --> 02:17:32.814]  It just adds to the next level with the PQQ, the CoQ10, and more.
[02:17:33.533 --> 02:17:36.875]  There's so much for your body, so much for your telomeres.
[02:17:36.895 --> 02:17:38.315]  40% off Infowarsstore.com.
[02:17:38.695 --> 02:17:47.259]  Last day to get Ultra 12, last day to get X2, last day to get Winter Sun for 50% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:47.279 --> 02:17:50.381]  40% on the X2, 50% off on the Winter Sun and Ultra 12.
[02:17:52.346 --> 02:18:00.391]  There's also a lot of other great products there on the site as well, like Living Defense, and there is also Fibergreens, but that's running out.
[02:18:00.951 --> 02:18:05.294]  There's Alpha Powers now back in stock, a lot of great books, a lot of great films, a lot of great t-shirts.
[02:18:05.814 --> 02:18:08.316]  Water filtration, air filtration, all the highest rated.
[02:18:08.876 --> 02:18:22.202]   You can go out and find high rated air filters and water filters that just don't have all the big store mock-up, you know, add-on prices, and people buy our water filters and air filters, Lexapur and Propur and all of it, And they go, "My God, I went and looked this up.
[02:18:22.202 --> 02:18:24.402]  It's in the top rated, it's like a hundred brands.
[02:18:24.402 --> 02:18:26.322]  It's in the top two or three brands."
[02:18:26.322 --> 02:18:29.841]   Why is it a third of the price of something you're gonna buy, you know,
[02:18:29.841 --> 02:18:30.681]  in a big box store?
[02:18:30.681 --> 02:18:34.442]   Because there's not the overhead and we're not putting a bunch of markup on it,
[02:18:34.442 --> 02:18:37.082]  but we gotta sell a lot of it to fund our operations.
[02:18:37.082 --> 02:18:41.201]   So the globalists are working around the clock to try to keep us off air.
[02:18:41.201 --> 02:18:47.988]   They're demonizing us, they're lying about us, We're here, we're strong, and we got a lot of stuff going on.
[02:18:48.048 --> 02:18:49.590]  You like how we just, hey, you like COVID land?
[02:18:49.610 --> 02:18:50.952]  Professionally produced major film.
[02:18:51.672 --> 02:18:53.194]  Seen four million times for free.
[02:18:55.817 --> 02:18:59.301]  Thirty-something thousand copies or whatever of it out now on DVD, getting made copies.
[02:18:59.341 --> 02:19:00.363]  That's another big punch.
[02:19:01.832 --> 02:19:03.614]  I'd call that a medium-sized punch.
[02:19:03.654 --> 02:19:08.799]  We've got eight big punches that are almost ready to go in a bunch of different ways.
[02:19:09.419 --> 02:19:11.281]  Some you'll hear about here on the air, some you'll never hear about.
[02:19:11.301 --> 02:19:12.102]  We're not going to get the credit.
[02:19:12.142 --> 02:19:12.703]  That's okay.
[02:19:13.704 --> 02:19:17.407]  So, again, you cannot fund a place that's more tip of the spear.
[02:19:17.447 --> 02:19:19.129]  And I've got a lot of new stuff we're going to launch.
[02:19:19.409 --> 02:19:20.230]  I'm working with other folks.
[02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:21.191]  A lot of things we're going to be doing.
[02:19:21.571 --> 02:19:24.054]  You're going to see massive activity out of us.
[02:19:25.799 --> 02:19:27.520]  Right through until whatever happens.
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:33.783]  Until the Lord comes, or until they arrest Fauci and Bill Gates, or until they throw my ass in prison or kill me.
[02:19:34.443 --> 02:19:38.845]  I've just got my duty and my job, and I'm gonna stay at my post, fighting these people.
[02:19:38.945 --> 02:19:41.506]  And now we're having more effect in a week than we used to have in a year.
[02:19:41.566 --> 02:19:42.647]  People know this is true.
[02:19:43.147 --> 02:19:48.109]  We're having record listeners, despite de-platforming, coming to Bandai Video, coming to InfoWars.com.
[02:19:48.390 --> 02:19:49.690]  People are hungry for the truth.
[02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:53.112]  So, get this information out to everybody.
[02:19:53.897 --> 02:19:55.918]  Okay, let's go to Tim in Washington.
[02:19:55.938 --> 02:19:56.678]  Tim, thanks for holding.
[02:19:58.498 --> 02:19:58.998]  Hey, Alex.
[02:19:59.599 --> 02:19:59.919]  Welcome.
[02:19:59.939 --> 02:20:00.699]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:20:00.719 --> 02:20:00.959]  Good.
[02:20:01.299 --> 02:20:01.519]  Hey.
[02:20:02.239 --> 02:20:03.600]  It's really good to talk to you again.
[02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:09.781]  I called you right before you went to January 6th, and I tried to invite you to the Gates Foundation.
[02:20:10.381 --> 02:20:11.962]  I am currently in round number 65.
[02:20:12.582 --> 02:20:17.643]  I have bullhorned the Gates Foundation 65 times, and I've led several rallies.
[02:20:17.723 --> 02:20:19.564]  In about 10 minutes, I'm supposed to give a speech.
[02:20:20.566 --> 02:20:22.528]  The March for Freedom, Washington.
[02:20:22.548 --> 02:20:23.769]  It's at City Hall.
[02:20:24.329 --> 02:20:26.871]  And I'd like to encourage everybody to get loud.
[02:20:27.071 --> 02:20:30.594]  And the globalists need to never have a moment of silence.
[02:20:31.564 --> 02:20:32.724]  Yes, I play your show all the time.
[02:20:32.744 --> 02:20:36.605]  I've played Plandemic 2 probably 20 times in its entirety at the Gates Foundation in my car or over my bullhorn.
[02:20:36.444 --> 02:20:41.764]   and Instagram, driving around bullhorning and even playing my show at the Bill & Melinda
[02:20:41.764 --> 02:20:42.764]  Gates Foundation?
[02:20:42.764 --> 02:20:43.764]  All the time.
[02:20:43.764 --> 02:20:45.203]  Yes, I play your show all the time.
[02:20:45.203 --> 02:20:50.203]   I've played Plandemic 2 probably 20 times in its entirety at the Gates Foundation in
[02:20:50.203 --> 02:20:52.764]  my car or over my bullhorn.
[02:20:52.764 --> 02:20:55.404]  And my bullhorn's 112 decimals.
[02:20:55.404 --> 02:20:58.844]  And you can, it's only 150 bucks.
[02:20:58.933 --> 02:21:00.714]  It sounds like there's a pretty good crowd out there.
[02:21:00.734 --> 02:21:07.638]  Did you notice he got confronted in London trying to go meet with that globalist criminal to plan their next attack?
[02:21:08.759 --> 02:21:10.360]  Oh no, a big smile on my face.
[02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:11.520]  I feel the momentum.
[02:21:11.641 --> 02:21:13.121]  I feel humanity rising up.
[02:21:13.321 --> 02:21:14.402]  I feel it within me.
[02:21:14.502 --> 02:21:15.763]  I'm sure you feel it within you.
[02:21:15.823 --> 02:21:24.355]   And there's so many people in the state of Washington that are patriots that just don't have that They just don't have that spark yet, and we're trying to motivate them.
[02:21:24.375 --> 02:21:28.618]  We're trying to breathe it back into them, because, you know, we're all American.
[02:21:29.539 --> 02:21:30.920]  You know, I'm going to get your name and number.
[02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:34.883]  I want to get you on as a guest tomorrow, brother, to talk about how you're taking action.
[02:21:34.903 --> 02:21:36.664]  We'll get you on for 30 minutes tomorrow, and we'll put you on hold.
[02:21:37.164 --> 02:21:38.105]  I'm glad I got to you.
[02:21:38.125 --> 02:21:39.466]  I got to, like, 20 calls.
[02:21:40.407 --> 02:21:44.430]  I can't get to the other callers, so get their name and number if they want to be on tomorrow.
[02:21:44.490 --> 02:21:55.834]   I'll call them back when we take calls, and I am intending to I'm going to start, by the end of the year, a three-night-a-week, commercial-free show that is two to three hours.
[02:21:55.974 --> 02:22:01.500]  It'll be different, you know, sometimes I'll do an hour, sometimes I'll do four hours, where I'm going to come in and just take phone calls.
[02:22:02.751 --> 02:22:05.831]   And if radio stations and TV stations want it, they can get it.
[02:22:05.831 --> 02:22:10.111]   But it's gonna be designed for internet, our own streaming systems, for everybody.
[02:22:10.111 --> 02:22:16.391]   And I'm intending to do two or three hours, three nights a week, so we can just take your calls
[02:22:16.391 --> 02:22:20.671]   and have guests on and just sit back and really kick ass.
[02:22:20.671 --> 02:22:22.110]  Plus I'm more relaxed at night.
[02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:23.511]  And I need to be on air more than three hours.
[02:22:23.511 --> 02:22:24.511]  I'm just totally fired up.
[02:22:24.511 --> 02:22:25.671]  History's here.
[02:22:25.671 --> 02:22:29.991]   And we've gotta have a venue for people to be on air and to be able to hear what's happening
[02:22:29.991 --> 02:22:31.151]  and what's going on.
[02:22:31.804 --> 02:22:38.531]  And then I'm going to get other hosts to step up and the other nights of the week and just do call-in shows that are commercial-free and just take calls.
[02:22:38.551 --> 02:22:39.592]  Gerald Salenti's taking over.
[02:22:39.892 --> 02:22:41.094]  There's a lot I didn't get to.
[02:22:42.051 --> 02:22:44.413]  There's something special that's going to be on the Owen Schroyer Show.
[02:22:44.973 --> 02:22:51.598]  Antifa, that works for Soros, they're beating people up and stuff in Australia, trying to say they want internal lockdowns.
[02:22:51.638 --> 02:22:56.641]  Supposing anarchists, with the state and the UN, wanting permanent lockdowns against common people.
[02:22:56.921 --> 02:22:58.342]  What a group of scum.
[02:22:58.603 --> 02:22:59.683]  What a group of trash.
[02:23:00.204 --> 02:23:01.445]  Gerald Salente takes over.
[02:23:02.185 --> 02:23:05.828]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and thank you Alex for all that you do.
[02:23:06.608 --> 02:23:10.651]  And the great staff that you have there, that does so much to give so much.
[02:23:11.733 --> 02:23:15.215]  And you gotta let you get a lot when you listen to InfoWars.
[02:23:15.896 --> 02:23:17.977]  So support InfoWars any way you can.
[02:23:18.658 --> 02:23:20.679]  Because censorship is real.
[02:23:21.539 --> 02:23:23.321]  And they're blocking out the truth.
[02:23:23.841 --> 02:23:27.423]  And this is from the Toilet Paper Record today.
[02:23:27.443 --> 02:23:28.784]  The front page.
[02:23:28.884 --> 02:23:33.247]  Public health crisis grows with distrust and threats.
[02:23:34.288 --> 02:23:40.752]  New local laws strip officials across US of power to fight spread of virus.
[02:23:41.650 --> 02:24:02.641]  In other words, anybody that doesn't agree with what the crap that they're throwing down our throats, we're considered conspiracy theorists, morons, imbeciles, and you have no right to think for yourself.
[02:24:03.681 --> 02:24:20.984]   It's just, again, these are the same slime balls, the murderous pieces of low-life crap The New York Times, the Toilet Paper Record, they call themselves the Paper of Record, and all the news that's fit to print.
[02:24:21.124 --> 02:24:22.425]  All the news that's fit to print?
[02:24:22.765 --> 02:24:27.928]  You mean all the crap that comes out of your mouth that you're selling and getting advertising money for?
[02:24:27.948 --> 02:24:29.570]  Is that what you're talking about?
[02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:35.994]  Because you're the low lives, remember those aluminum tubes that Saddam Hussein had, you know?
[02:24:36.794 --> 02:24:40.177]  And he was building those weapons of mass destruction?
[02:24:40.777 --> 02:24:42.158]  And now you're selling this crap.
[02:24:43.163 --> 02:24:54.052]  And of course, the news is that Colin Powell, former Secretary of State, who made case for a Iraq invasion, dies of COVID complications at 84.
[02:24:54.232 --> 02:24:58.135]  That's the headline story in CNBC.
[02:24:58.955 --> 02:25:04.400]  And again, you have to read through the whole story to say that number one, he was dying, he had cancer.
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:07.322]  And number two, wait a minute, he got two shots.
[02:25:08.328 --> 02:25:09.449]  He got two vaxxers.
[02:25:09.509 --> 02:25:10.990]  He was fully vaccinated.
[02:25:11.350 --> 02:25:12.771]  Maybe even got booster shots.
[02:25:13.092 --> 02:25:14.673]  They say he was fully vaccinated.
[02:25:15.153 --> 02:25:20.137]  So I guess if he died of COVID complications, I guess the vaccinations don't work.
[02:25:21.057 --> 02:25:22.779]  I mean, am I making that up?
[02:25:23.239 --> 02:25:29.083]  Or maybe some little piece of low-life crap in the New York slime would call me a conspiracy theory.
[02:25:29.364 --> 02:25:30.644]  Oh, I know what they would say.
[02:25:31.225 --> 02:25:35.568]  They would say that, oh, how disrespectful I am for Colin Powell.
[02:25:35.948 --> 02:25:36.549]  Guess what?
[02:25:38.308 --> 02:25:41.010]  Mike Baker or Danielle Ivory?
[02:25:41.871 --> 02:25:44.712]  I call that low-life piece of crap a murderer.
[02:25:45.133 --> 02:25:45.733]  That's right.
[02:25:46.474 --> 02:25:48.675]  Listen to all my YouTubes going way back.
[02:25:49.135 --> 02:25:50.717]  Read about it in the Trends Journal.
[02:25:51.077 --> 02:25:55.920]  Remember how I got blackballed from all the media for calling the Iraq War a lie.
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:26:03.125]  And Colin Powell poured his colon crap down that little vial of his colon crap.
[02:26:04.546 --> 02:26:05.507]  Telling the American...
[02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:09.081]  I'll never forget watching it on the UN.
[02:26:09.121 --> 02:26:10.421]  It went on for over an hour.
[02:26:11.121 --> 02:26:16.363]  This is proof that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and tied Salqaeda.
[02:26:16.723 --> 02:26:19.744]  Look at that little piece of colon crap!
[02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:21.745]  That's what's in that vial!
[02:26:23.085 --> 02:26:24.085]  That murderer!
[02:26:24.966 --> 02:26:25.946]  That murderer!
[02:26:26.686 --> 02:26:29.007]  That killed all those people in Iraq!
[02:26:30.427 --> 02:26:31.848]  Yeah, that's right!
[02:26:32.811 --> 02:26:36.875]  Oh, if only a black person was Secretary of State.
[02:26:37.235 --> 02:26:39.677]  That's the kind of crap they shove down your throat.
[02:26:39.998 --> 02:26:44.522]  Has nothing to do with white, green, yellow, transgender, straight.
[02:26:45.382 --> 02:26:47.024]  It has to do with good and evil.
[02:26:48.385 --> 02:26:50.706]  How about Condoleezza Rice?
[02:26:51.166 --> 02:26:51.807]  Oh, yeah!
[02:26:52.207 --> 02:26:54.048]  Not white as Rice, man!
[02:26:54.308 --> 02:26:55.948]  No, black as Obama!
[02:26:56.228 --> 02:26:57.249]  The other murderer!
[02:26:57.509 --> 02:26:58.750]  It makes no difference!
[02:26:58.970 --> 02:27:00.670]  Wanna talk about white murderers?
[02:27:01.051 --> 02:27:01.471]  Oh, yeah!
[02:27:01.771 --> 02:27:04.092]  We got Penis Cheney over here!
[02:27:04.492 --> 02:27:08.294]  Quoted by the, uh... CNBC.
[02:27:09.324 --> 02:27:26.910]  And again, I have to be proper because I'm Alex Jones Show, and I can't call him Dick Cheney, the lying, murderous piece of slime that got us into the Iraq War, the American soldiers that were killed, all the people that were killed there.
[02:27:27.050 --> 02:27:28.951]  Oh, and what did they do to Snowden?
[02:27:29.471 --> 02:27:29.871]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:30.452 --> 02:27:31.212]  Put him in jail.
[02:27:31.512 --> 02:27:36.954]  Why not send him to Guantanamo for showing the videos of, oh, hey, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[02:27:37.808 --> 02:27:40.830]  Killing all those innocent people in Iraq.
[02:27:41.350 --> 02:27:46.853]  Yeah, let's see what Dick, Dick, Dick Cheney has to say.
[02:27:48.734 --> 02:27:58.760]  Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was Defense Secretary during the first Gulf War, also paid tribute to Powell.
[02:28:00.381 --> 02:28:04.543]  I'm deeply saddened to learn that America has lost a leader and a statesman.
[02:28:05.003 --> 02:28:06.444]  Not a leader, a liar!
[02:28:07.171 --> 02:28:08.893]  A liar like you!
[02:28:09.293 --> 02:28:13.177]  Like you, you little scum that lied us into the war!
[02:28:13.437 --> 02:28:17.480]  How come these people aren't brought up on war crime charges?
[02:28:18.101 --> 02:28:25.988]  Little Georgie Bush, another arrogant little piece of low-life, roughing crap daddy's boy.
[02:28:26.508 --> 02:28:31.293]  Little daddy's boy born on third base and thought he had a home run.
[02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:32.610]  Yeah.
[02:28:33.031 --> 02:28:33.331]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:33.431 --> 02:28:33.731]  Oh, yeah.
[02:28:33.751 --> 02:28:35.892]  I know you like the Afghan war better.
[02:28:36.192 --> 02:28:37.793]  We're going to get Osama bin Laden.
[02:28:38.213 --> 02:28:38.994]  Get her alive.
[02:28:39.314 --> 02:28:39.954]  Not we.
[02:28:40.295 --> 02:28:44.357]  You're sending the people that believe your lies and they die for it.
[02:28:44.617 --> 02:28:45.437]  How many U.S.
[02:28:45.498 --> 02:28:47.799]  troops are killing themselves daily?
[02:28:48.139 --> 02:28:48.899]  Suicide?
[02:28:50.200 --> 02:28:55.423]  Because sent to war on lies, killing innocent people, destroying entire nations?
[02:28:56.464 --> 02:28:58.685]  Only about 20 a day, according to the data.
[02:29:01.798 --> 02:29:09.145]  He was such a favorite of presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom twice.
[02:29:09.746 --> 02:29:11.087]  That's Jerome Powell.
[02:29:11.387 --> 02:29:11.588]  Yep!
[02:29:12.188 --> 02:29:13.309]  Favorite of presidents!
[02:29:13.770 --> 02:29:17.193]  Murderous pieces of scum crap!
[02:29:17.694 --> 02:29:18.354]  Wanna name him?
[02:29:19.175 --> 02:29:21.737]  Let's start with... Hey, I got it.
[02:29:22.038 --> 02:29:24.500]  Um... Well, they killed Kennedy, right?
[02:29:24.540 --> 02:29:24.901]  Wasn't, uh...
[02:29:26.457 --> 02:29:27.217]  Oh, what's his name?
[02:29:27.277 --> 02:29:28.838]  Oh, the Rumsfeld.
[02:29:29.218 --> 02:29:32.698]  Look at these little freaks that tell the people what to do.
[02:29:33.059 --> 02:29:35.499]  How could you believe these pieces of scum?
[02:29:35.959 --> 02:29:39.220]  How could you believe these pieces of lying crap?
[02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:44.701]  Oh yeah, let's go back to the people that sent us to war, the great presidents.
[02:29:45.861 --> 02:29:47.282]  I know, I know.
[02:29:47.562 --> 02:29:50.702]  There's little, little, little Clinton.
[02:29:51.203 --> 02:29:51.843]  Oh yeah.
[02:29:52.623 --> 02:29:52.863]  Yep.
[02:29:53.996 --> 02:29:54.797]  Killed more people.
[02:29:54.977 --> 02:30:05.929]  You remember Madeleine Albright, UN Secretary and Ambassador to the UN, telling Lesley Stahl that, look at these little, little, little, these jerks.
[02:30:06.624 --> 02:30:26.701]  Telling Leslie Stahl that the price of 500,000 Iraqi children, dead, under the age of five, while little Clinton, every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away over Iraq, put sanctions on him, killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five, and Madeleine Albright says, yes, it was worth the price.
[02:30:29.943 --> 02:30:31.064]  Jerome Powell, huh?
[02:30:31.725 --> 02:30:31.885]  Yep.
[02:30:32.589 --> 02:30:33.750]  All the president's men.
[02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:35.251]  Nixon, murderer.
[02:30:35.351 --> 02:30:36.432]  Johnson, murderer.
[02:30:36.732 --> 02:30:37.933]  Bush's murderers.
[02:30:38.714 --> 02:30:40.295]  Obama!
[02:30:40.755 --> 02:30:43.857]  The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner!
[02:30:44.117 --> 02:30:45.839]  I'm really good at killing people, aren't I?
[02:30:45.879 --> 02:30:46.179]  Yeah.
[02:30:46.439 --> 02:30:47.760]  Quoted in the book Double Down.
[02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:50.082]  Bombs away, drone anybody.
[02:30:50.102 --> 02:30:53.324]  Oh yeah, who do we got?
[02:30:53.564 --> 02:30:54.645]  One after another.
[02:30:54.685 --> 02:30:56.206]  The president's love, Powell.
[02:30:56.767 --> 02:30:57.427]  Not me!
[02:30:57.987 --> 02:30:58.508]  Not me!
[02:30:59.341 --> 02:31:11.889]  He should have been brought up on war crime charges, as Penis Janey should, as Bush should, as Condoleezza Rice should, and that Wolfershit should!
[02:31:12.629 --> 02:31:13.650]  All of them should!
[02:31:14.891 --> 02:31:15.311]  Murder!
[02:31:17.012 --> 02:31:17.712]  Peace on Earth!
[02:31:18.353 --> 02:31:19.413]  Goodwill to men!
[02:31:20.774 --> 02:31:22.916]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:31:23.736 --> 02:31:26.598]  Yeah, you know, when I'm talking about Colin Powell, I'm very angry.
[02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:30.682]  You know, I launched Occupy Peace because of the warmongers.
[02:31:31.303 --> 02:31:31.803]  That's right.
[02:31:32.063 --> 02:31:33.524]  And all those libtards, huh?
[02:31:33.964 --> 02:31:37.046]  Yeah, they love their Obama, that warmonger.
[02:31:38.788 --> 02:31:41.589]  Everybody, oh, how wonderful Colin Powell was.
[02:31:42.030 --> 02:31:42.210]  Yep.
[02:31:42.750 --> 02:31:45.772]  Bush called him a great public servant.
[02:31:46.333 --> 02:31:47.113]  Public servant?
[02:31:47.153 --> 02:31:48.174]  What public servant?
[02:31:51.376 --> 02:31:55.699]  You lied us into war with your little Colin crap.
[02:31:57.159 --> 02:32:01.775]  These people should be brought up on war crime tribunals!
[02:32:03.251 --> 02:32:04.251]  The facts were there.
[02:32:04.291 --> 02:32:07.652]  They were blackballing everybody from the media.
[02:32:07.692 --> 02:32:20.135]  We wrote about it in detail during the Iraq war that came out against the war because the facts were lies brought to you by the slime ball New York slime and all the rest.
[02:32:20.275 --> 02:32:21.736]  Oh, MSNBC!
[02:32:22.216 --> 02:32:22.716]  Yeah!
[02:32:23.116 --> 02:32:27.237]  They fired Phil Donahue for coming out against the war.
[02:32:28.519 --> 02:32:31.341]  They would only bring people on that were pro-war.
[02:32:31.361 --> 02:32:33.943]  You could look at the numbers we had them in our Trends Journal.
[02:32:34.223 --> 02:32:35.584]  The facts are there.
[02:32:36.425 --> 02:32:38.606]  And they're doing the same thing with the COVID war.
[02:32:39.267 --> 02:32:44.070]  If you don't suck up and believe the COVID war, then you have no right to say anything.
[02:32:44.791 --> 02:32:47.192]  Our scientific experts say it.
[02:32:48.793 --> 02:32:50.555]  My God is nature.
[02:32:53.537 --> 02:32:55.298]  Your God is science.
[02:32:56.804 --> 02:32:58.265]  Shove your science.
[02:32:59.066 --> 02:33:01.267]  I believe in my God of nature.
[02:33:01.627 --> 02:33:12.614]  Don't you dare tell me that my God is demonic, because that's what you've done when you blackball me and others.
[02:33:12.994 --> 02:33:18.077]  And by the way, natural healing.
[02:33:18.618 --> 02:33:19.218]  That's right.
[02:33:19.698 --> 02:33:21.800]  That's the first book I worked on.
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:22.780]  I didn't write it.
[02:33:23.220 --> 02:33:24.021]  I worked on it.
[02:33:25.245 --> 02:33:29.466]  And my former wife, may she rest in peace, sold it to Warner Books.
[02:33:29.666 --> 02:33:31.027]  It was a big book.
[02:33:32.567 --> 02:33:33.188]  But no!
[02:33:34.988 --> 02:33:41.430]  You're not allowed to believe in the human god or the godly god of nature.
[02:33:41.710 --> 02:33:47.972]  You only could believe in the man-made brain of science.
[02:33:50.233 --> 02:33:50.633]  Anyway.
[02:33:53.274 --> 02:33:53.514]  Again.
[02:33:54.668 --> 02:33:56.348]  This is the crap that they're selling.
[02:33:56.988 --> 02:34:00.529]  Front page New York Times shows a picture of West Virginia here.
[02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:06.810]  Rolesburg sewage spill in the Cheek River in heavy storm.
[02:34:07.610 --> 02:34:10.691]  Data finds no state more exposed to floods than West Virginia.
[02:34:11.211 --> 02:34:12.831]  I spent six years in West Virginia.
[02:34:13.972 --> 02:34:16.292]  I went to the University of Charleston and WVU.
[02:34:17.052 --> 02:34:18.312]  Wonderful, wonderful people.
[02:34:18.332 --> 02:34:20.633]  The place is so poor and they destroyed it.
[02:34:20.933 --> 02:34:21.493]  Destroyed it.
[02:34:23.041 --> 02:34:24.621]  When I was there, there was Union Carbide.
[02:34:24.641 --> 02:34:27.142]  We used to wake up in the morning, chemical smells everywhere.
[02:34:27.542 --> 02:34:27.902]  Everywhere.
[02:34:29.182 --> 02:34:31.363]  The sky was yellowish green.
[02:34:33.303 --> 02:34:38.565]  They've leveled all the tops of the beautiful mountains.
[02:34:38.605 --> 02:34:42.566]  They used to call West Virginia the Switzerland of America.
[02:34:42.586 --> 02:34:43.406]  It was so beautiful.
[02:34:44.266 --> 02:34:45.346]  And the people were wonderful.
[02:34:47.207 --> 02:35:01.718]   But they're making the point here about this guy, the senator, And then you read in New York, these are today's papers.
[02:35:02.418 --> 02:35:04.358]  This is, by the way, how you forecast trends.
[02:35:04.378 --> 02:35:06.579]  You look at the current events forming future trends.
[02:35:07.439 --> 02:35:09.520]  Energy crisis pressures renewables.
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:20.363]  The energy price shock is serving as a reminder of the world's continued dependency on fossil fuels, even amid efforts to shift to renewable sources of energy.
[02:35:22.842 --> 02:35:24.782]  So, climate change.
[02:35:25.143 --> 02:35:27.963]  It's either going to be COVID war or climate change.
[02:35:28.003 --> 02:35:34.765]  That's the only two things that the idiot, moron, low-life pieces of scum media, prostitutes sell.
[02:35:36.805 --> 02:35:39.386]  France to invest in nuclear reactors.
[02:35:40.866 --> 02:35:42.207]  The green energy product.
[02:35:42.787 --> 02:35:45.927]  They're calling nuclear... This is from the slime, the New York slime.
[02:35:46.448 --> 02:35:50.088]  They're calling nuclear reactors green energy.
[02:35:50.629 --> 02:35:51.109]  That's right.
[02:35:51.409 --> 02:35:52.229]  Oh, Fukushima?
[02:35:52.978 --> 02:35:53.998]  Oh, forgot about that.
[02:35:54.318 --> 02:35:59.820]  Oh, they're dumping all that, all that radioactive water.
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:00.800]  Now they're dumping it in.
[02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:01.900]  Oh, yeah, but it's fine.
[02:36:01.940 --> 02:36:02.460]  It's fine.
[02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:03.721]  It stops right there.
[02:36:03.741 --> 02:36:05.961]  It's still pumping out a mile there.
[02:36:05.981 --> 02:36:06.541]  It just stops.
[02:36:06.581 --> 02:36:06.741]  Right.
[02:36:06.761 --> 02:36:07.802]  Doesn't flow anywhere.
[02:36:08.482 --> 02:36:09.302]  Oh, Chernobyl.
[02:36:09.702 --> 02:36:10.342]  Wonderful.
[02:36:10.522 --> 02:36:11.203]  Wonderful.
[02:36:12.183 --> 02:36:12.343]  Yeah.
[02:36:12.383 --> 02:36:13.363]  Don't worry about it.
[02:36:13.803 --> 02:36:14.863]  Don't worry about it.
[02:36:15.424 --> 02:36:18.284]  It's nuclear radioactive.
[02:36:18.544 --> 02:36:20.845]  It is so clean and nice.
[02:36:22.052 --> 02:36:23.833]  It is so wonderful for you?
[02:36:23.853 --> 02:36:27.315]  Yeah, little Katso Makron, another little boy.
[02:36:27.815 --> 02:36:28.776]  These aren't men.
[02:36:29.176 --> 02:36:30.717]  These aren't men!
[02:36:31.317 --> 02:36:32.618]  They're maniacs.
[02:36:34.619 --> 02:36:37.361]  Again, how could anybody take crap from these people?
[02:36:38.141 --> 02:36:38.682]  And they do.
[02:36:41.323 --> 02:36:49.868]  And speaking of maniacs, craps, banksters, bandits, liars, again, get this in your head, everybody.
[02:36:50.839 --> 02:36:52.400]  This is not a government.
[02:36:53.981 --> 02:36:54.541]  It's gone.
[02:36:55.141 --> 02:36:57.382]  What they call democracies are not governments.
[02:36:57.822 --> 02:37:07.807]  Whether it's Italy, whether it's Australia, whether it's France, whether it's Germany, or whether it's the U.S.S.A.
[02:37:08.247 --> 02:37:10.348]  They're crime syndicates.
[02:37:10.929 --> 02:37:11.329]  Got it?
[02:37:12.109 --> 02:37:12.489]  Got it?
[02:37:12.890 --> 02:37:15.571]  Boys and girls and children of all ages.
[02:37:15.911 --> 02:37:19.893]  It's the Barnum and Bailey circus right in front of your eyes.
[02:37:20.842 --> 02:37:26.265]  Jerome Powell sold more than a million dollars of stock as the market was tanking.
[02:37:28.086 --> 02:37:28.846]  Yeah!
[02:37:30.507 --> 02:37:39.652]  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sold between 1 million and 5 million dollars worth of stock from his personal account on October 1st, 2020.
[02:37:43.173 --> 02:37:50.453]   right before the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered a significant drop.
[02:37:50.453 --> 02:37:58.932]  All right.
[02:37:59.236 --> 02:38:01.217]  It's one big club and you ain't in it.
[02:38:01.817 --> 02:38:03.297]  That other scum!
[02:38:04.178 --> 02:38:05.498]  That other scum!
[02:38:05.898 --> 02:38:06.318]  Arrogant!
[02:38:06.378 --> 02:38:08.659]  Oh, by the way, you know how much Jerome is worth?
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:13.241]  All us people of Slavelandia that have to work every day?
[02:38:14.061 --> 02:38:17.302]  Oh, you don't like getting $15 an hour?
[02:38:17.642 --> 02:38:24.164]  And by the time it taxes and everything else, after working in Amazon, it's $62.50 a week and a hernia?
[02:38:24.445 --> 02:38:25.505]  Oh, you don't like that?
[02:38:28.522 --> 02:38:33.706]  Let's see what Jerome Powell is worth.
[02:38:34.327 --> 02:38:39.511]  His net worth is between $20 million and $55 million.
[02:38:39.931 --> 02:38:46.076]  And they write it's probably worth more since the broad market is up nearly 20% this year.
[02:38:46.436 --> 02:38:46.776]  Look at him!
[02:38:47.137 --> 02:38:47.457]  Look at him!
[02:38:48.559 --> 02:39:00.670]  Bankster bandits brought to you by another war criminal, Woodrow Wilson, who gave us the federal income tax to fight World War I that we never should have been in, and brought us the banksters.
[02:39:03.092 --> 02:39:08.597]  And that other scumbags I was talking about, and I'll call them that to their face!
[02:39:09.698 --> 02:39:14.242]  How about that guy Kaplan over there, down in Texas, yeah!
[02:39:15.111 --> 02:39:15.511]  Yeah!
[02:39:15.571 --> 02:39:17.132]  The Fed Chairman down there!
[02:39:17.432 --> 02:39:18.032]  The President!
[02:39:18.052 --> 02:39:19.313]  The President of the Fed Chair!
[02:39:19.653 --> 02:39:22.534]  And Rosengrant up here in Massachusetts!
[02:39:22.574 --> 02:39:22.974]  Yeah!
[02:39:23.414 --> 02:39:25.475]  Oh, I was up in Massachusetts yesterday!
[02:39:25.715 --> 02:39:27.096]  It's Massachusetts!
[02:39:27.456 --> 02:39:32.438]  I was just up in, uh, um... What's the name of that place?
[02:39:32.458 --> 02:39:37.639]  Starts with an S, um... Anyway.
[02:39:40.641 --> 02:39:42.421]  Everybody, 70% of the people were mass... Stop it.
[02:39:45.023 --> 02:39:45.183]  Yep.
[02:39:45.663 --> 02:39:46.303]  Stockbridge.
[02:39:46.383 --> 02:39:50.904]  I was in Stockbridge yesterday.
[02:39:50.924 --> 02:39:52.845]  People walking down the street masked up.
[02:39:53.985 --> 02:39:55.925]  Said, Rosengren!
[02:39:56.505 --> 02:39:58.046]  Rosengren!
[02:39:58.706 --> 02:40:00.246]  And Kaplan!
[02:40:00.946 --> 02:40:03.407]  All doing inside trading!
[02:40:03.807 --> 02:40:06.567]  Knowing what they're gonna do before the markets open!
[02:40:07.028 --> 02:40:08.288]  Multi-millionaires!
[02:40:08.408 --> 02:40:09.388]  Get back to work!
[02:40:10.068 --> 02:40:11.648]  People of Slavelandia!
[02:40:12.169 --> 02:40:13.729]  The banksters are in charge!
[02:40:14.972 --> 02:40:18.914]  Jesus Christ drew, beat him out of the temple with a whip.
[02:40:19.354 --> 02:40:22.395]  Three days later, Christ is on the cross.
[02:40:23.515 --> 02:40:27.437]  The banksters, and they're running and ruining our lives.
[02:40:27.857 --> 02:40:29.698]  The whole thing is a scam.
[02:40:30.598 --> 02:40:37.120]  Climate change, banksters, COVID war, Iraq war, Afghan war.
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:40.862]  It's a war against the people, a war against us.
[02:40:42.262 --> 02:40:44.183]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:40:45.140 --> 02:40:46.721]  And they wonder what they're doing.
[02:40:46.741 --> 02:40:50.282]  They're giving you information that's very hard to find anymore.
[02:40:50.982 --> 02:40:52.703]  Of course, we do in the Trends Journal.
[02:40:53.203 --> 02:40:55.984]  You know, last week was 165 pages.
[02:40:56.024 --> 02:40:57.884]  The week before, 176 pages.
[02:40:58.585 --> 02:41:00.505]  You don't have to read the whole thing.
[02:41:00.545 --> 02:41:02.786]  You read the important stories.
[02:41:03.486 --> 02:41:05.687]  Tell you what's going on, what's next, and what it means.
[02:41:06.407 --> 02:41:08.668]  So the bottom line is the bottom line.
[02:41:09.528 --> 02:41:11.569]  That we do what we're doing.
[02:41:11.589 --> 02:41:14.510]  We have a subscription-based magazine.
[02:41:15.251 --> 02:41:17.133]  And Infowars is doing what they're doing.
[02:41:17.153 --> 02:41:20.997]  You know, they're not doing it from commercials, they're selling these great products.
[02:41:21.738 --> 02:41:23.580]  And they got great sales going on now.
[02:41:24.321 --> 02:41:28.626]  And this is the time for you to really put your money where your mind is, because it's only going to get worse out there.
[02:41:29.147 --> 02:41:31.068]  They're robbing us of our freedom around the world.
[02:41:31.409 --> 02:41:36.192]  And InfoWars has an emergency supply chain breakdown sale.
[02:41:36.572 --> 02:41:38.273]  And there's only three days left to this.
[02:41:38.654 --> 02:41:40.015]  And you can save up to 50%.
[02:41:40.855 --> 02:41:42.837]  That's right.

[02:41:51.463 --> 02:41:54.485]  And many of these top selling products, they're going to sell out quick.
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:42:03.030]  And they want you to really stock up now because the imminent second lockdown takes place and everybody knows what's going on.
[02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:06.734]  The supply chain disruptions, the lack of labor, on and on.
[02:42:07.075 --> 02:42:09.658]  So it's going to be, you better get this stuff now.
[02:42:10.481 --> 02:42:14.404]  They have the DNA Force Plus, that's back in stock, 40% off.

[02:43:41.182 --> 02:43:43.504]  Because if you don't support it, it's gone.
[02:43:44.465 --> 02:43:44.865]  And they're gone.
[02:43:44.885 --> 02:43:45.786]  Where are you going to get your news?
[02:43:45.806 --> 02:43:47.087]  From the toilet paper record?
[02:43:48.108 --> 02:43:50.269]  Or these big companies that are buying out everybody?
[02:43:50.349 --> 02:43:51.750]  It's very hard to find information.
[02:43:51.770 --> 02:43:54.292]  That's why the Trends Journal does so well as well.
[02:43:54.672 --> 02:43:56.834]  Because people are looking for the truth in trends.
[02:43:57.875 --> 02:43:59.376]  So, I want to move forward here.
[02:44:00.066 --> 02:44:04.989]  I was talking before about the, um, banksters taking over.
[02:44:07.430 --> 02:44:09.231]  And it's not only the United States.
[02:44:10.592 --> 02:44:14.855]  Slovakia's central bank chief charged with corruption.
[02:44:15.055 --> 02:44:16.476]  This is from the Financial Times.
[02:44:17.336 --> 02:44:18.557]  It's a criminal group.
[02:44:19.257 --> 02:44:20.598]  Don't call them a government.
[02:44:21.178 --> 02:44:25.261]  They're banksters, they're drug dealers, the morons and imbeciles called Big Pharma.
[02:44:26.582 --> 02:44:32.658]   They're The military-industrial complex that Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, warned us about.
[02:44:32.678 --> 02:44:34.899]  And big tech.
[02:44:35.339 --> 02:44:35.999]  They're in charge.
[02:44:37.139 --> 02:44:38.140]  It's a crime syndicate.
[02:44:42.721 --> 02:44:46.181]  COVID turmoil exposes great finance divide.
[02:44:47.042 --> 02:44:47.782]  Financial time.
[02:44:48.722 --> 02:44:50.782]  By the way, see how these things are all underlined like this?
[02:44:51.423 --> 02:44:52.263]  All the notes on there?
[02:44:52.723 --> 02:44:53.663]  That's what I do every day.
[02:44:53.683 --> 02:44:55.744]  I read from all over the world.
[02:44:56.324 --> 02:44:57.044]  What's going on?
[02:44:58.283 --> 02:44:59.744]  Tell the writers what to write about.
[02:45:02.206 --> 02:45:09.191]  I say here, important, when interest rates rise, they're talking about the debt payments they have to make.
[02:45:09.752 --> 02:45:11.153]  The debt payments are going to rise.
[02:45:11.953 --> 02:45:13.535]  And interest rates are going to go up.
[02:45:14.495 --> 02:45:17.598]  When interest rates go up, this economy collapses.
[02:45:17.618 --> 02:45:21.200]  The equity markets collapse.
[02:45:22.361 --> 02:45:27.385]  We're going to see the likes of the greatest depression we've never witnessed in the world.
[02:45:29.224 --> 02:45:38.048]  And when all else fails, they take you to war, just like little Georgie Bush did when the Nasdaq was down 66% just before 9-11.
[02:45:38.368 --> 02:45:42.129]  People forget the dot-com bust, but not Transjournal subscribers.
[02:45:42.690 --> 02:45:45.871]  We said it would bust in our October 1999 issue.
[02:45:46.591 --> 02:45:48.412]  We said it would break by the second quarter of 2000.
[02:45:49.512 --> 02:45:50.633]  It did in March of 2000.
[02:45:50.733 --> 02:45:53.454]  We were in a deep recession.
[02:45:53.874 --> 02:45:55.755]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:45:56.884 --> 02:46:01.185]  88% believe Lying Little Bush's war to go into Afghanistan.
[02:46:01.365 --> 02:46:02.825]  Then they took us into Iraq.
[02:46:03.265 --> 02:46:05.186]  They created the fake real estate bubble.
[02:46:05.726 --> 02:46:10.667]  The Bankster Bandits got 29 trillion dollars by the Federal Reserve.
[02:46:10.687 --> 02:46:12.287]  They're not federal.
[02:46:12.848 --> 02:46:13.808]  The Gangster Bank.
[02:46:14.828 --> 02:46:16.408]  And in bailout money.
[02:46:17.189 --> 02:46:20.769]  As people lost their homes, subprime mortgages, on and on.
[02:46:21.109 --> 02:46:22.310]  It's a crime syndicate.
[02:46:22.690 --> 02:46:23.910]  Get it in your head everybody.
[02:46:25.527 --> 02:46:28.048]  Economic growth squeezed around the world.
[02:46:28.068 --> 02:46:32.909]  It's one after another.
[02:46:34.489 --> 02:46:34.869]  You ready?
[02:46:37.069 --> 02:46:39.910]  This is from The Guardian, early reported in America.
[02:46:40.970 --> 02:46:45.351]  Serious financial problems afflict 40% of U.S.
[02:46:45.391 --> 02:46:46.972]  households in recent months.
[02:46:48.012 --> 02:46:59.840]   Households struggle to afford medical care and food, with figures rising to 50% For those with incomes under $50,000 a year.
[02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:00.200]  $50,000 a year.
[02:47:00.821 --> 02:47:09.543]  You're working in Walmart, Dollar General, Home Depot, Lowe's, Staples.
[02:47:12.984 --> 02:47:14.524]  You're not making $50,000 a year.
[02:47:17.405 --> 02:47:18.905]  All the money's going to the top.
[02:47:22.628 --> 02:47:25.310]  It's the... This is not a capitalist society.
[02:47:26.131 --> 02:47:28.713]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:47:29.573 --> 02:47:37.179]  They're talking now about... Minutes show more consensus on tapering.
[02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:38.500]  Alright?
[02:47:41.642 --> 02:47:42.163]  Tapering.
[02:47:43.404 --> 02:47:50.509]  The Federal Reserve is buying a hundred and twenty billion dollars worth of bonds and corporate bonds and junk bonds.
[02:47:53.348 --> 02:47:54.808]  That's not capitalism.
[02:47:55.389 --> 02:48:00.310]  That's fascism, according to Mussolini, a guy that knew a thing or two about it.
[02:48:00.890 --> 02:48:03.551]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[02:48:05.452 --> 02:48:07.753]  The corporate powers are in full control.
[02:48:09.073 --> 02:48:14.055]  You look at all the people from the Goldman Sachs gang that are running the show.
[02:48:14.675 --> 02:48:16.815]  Oh, that guy Gensler from the SEC.
[02:48:16.835 --> 02:48:17.936]  Yeah, Goldman Sachs guy.
[02:48:18.296 --> 02:48:19.056]  One after another.
[02:48:19.416 --> 02:48:20.216]  All the banksters.
[02:48:20.637 --> 02:48:21.637]  JPMorgan Chase.
[02:48:23.967 --> 02:48:24.907]  Morgan Stanley.
[02:48:25.828 --> 02:48:26.789]  All throughout government.
[02:48:27.169 --> 02:48:28.630]  All throughout the financial system.
[02:48:29.050 --> 02:48:30.251]  It's not a free system.
[02:48:30.791 --> 02:48:32.092]  Get it in your head, everybody.
[02:48:32.912 --> 02:48:35.073]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:48:36.794 --> 02:48:37.855]  And it's gonna fail.
[02:48:39.216 --> 02:48:42.177]  You're talking about stagflation.
[02:48:45.119 --> 02:48:48.781]  Shadow of stagflation makes investors nervous.
[02:48:49.262 --> 02:48:50.322]  Again, this is what I gotta do.
[02:48:50.422 --> 02:48:51.743]  I gotta read all this crap, right?
[02:48:54.153 --> 02:48:56.394]  One story after another, every day.
[02:48:57.734 --> 02:48:59.174]  It's not stagflation.
[02:48:59.814 --> 02:49:03.955]  Stagflation means inflation goes up as the economy stagnates.
[02:49:06.436 --> 02:49:09.536]  My forecast is dragflation.
[02:49:12.077 --> 02:49:17.218]  The economy is going to go down as inflation keeps going up.
[02:49:19.554 --> 02:49:27.359]  And now with all of the people that aren't going to go back to work because they won't take the jab, you think you had a hiring problem before?
[02:49:28.419 --> 02:49:29.500]  And wages are going to go up.
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.181]  You're going to start seeing a lot more strikes.
[02:49:32.142 --> 02:49:35.223]  Deere, Kellogg, a number of them are already out there striking.
[02:49:37.064 --> 02:49:39.186]  We're going to start seeing more strength in unions.
[02:49:40.106 --> 02:49:41.247]  And back to the economy.
[02:49:42.127 --> 02:49:51.603]   Gold is stagnant right now, $17.66, but Bitcoin 40% of California state workers are unvaccinated.
[02:49:51.623 --> 02:49:54.944]  This is going on all over and they're underreporting the numbers.
[02:49:54.984 --> 02:49:59.545]  They're overreporting the numbers of vaccinated, underreporting the people that are fighting back.
[02:49:59.825 --> 02:50:02.165]  You saw the protests in Italy last week as well.
[02:50:03.566 --> 02:50:05.006]  There's going to be new third parties.
[02:50:05.866 --> 02:50:06.446]  Bitcoin.
[02:50:07.027 --> 02:50:13.528]  We nailed Bitcoin in the Trends Journal when it was going to take off, where it's at and where it's going to go next.
[02:50:14.928 --> 02:50:17.029]  Crypto techno revolution.
[02:50:17.674 --> 02:50:18.474]  That's who we're in.
[02:50:19.574 --> 02:50:20.595]  So jump on board.
[02:50:21.435 --> 02:50:22.655]  Again, think for yourself.
[02:50:22.695 --> 02:50:23.795]  We only put the information out.
[02:50:23.815 --> 02:50:24.975]  We don't give financial advice.
[02:50:25.575 --> 02:50:27.156]  This thing's gonna go down big and heavy.
[02:50:28.096 --> 02:50:30.056]  You're gonna see social unrest increase.
[02:50:30.716 --> 02:50:35.477]  Oh, Walgreens to close five stores in San Francisco because of thefts.
[02:50:36.237 --> 02:50:37.838]  How long ago did I say this would happen?
[02:50:37.858 --> 02:50:41.898]  When all else fa- When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:50:42.858 --> 02:50:43.539]  And they're losing it.
[02:50:44.539 --> 02:50:45.539]  It's gonna get a lot worse.
[02:50:46.522 --> 02:50:47.322]  So do what you can.
[02:50:47.642 --> 02:50:48.823]  We need to unite.
[02:50:49.343 --> 02:50:52.103]  Support InfoWars and Trends Journal.
[02:50:52.184 --> 02:50:53.444]  TrendsJournal.com.
[02:50:53.784 --> 02:50:55.704]  United we stand, divided we fall.
[02:50:59.665 --> 02:51:05.047]  People say all the time to me on the street, Alex, if you're a good guy, how are you still alive?
[02:51:06.664 --> 02:51:07.364]  Well, what does that mean?
[02:51:08.005 --> 02:51:12.087]  You don't judge whether I'm a good guy and I'm for real off of if I'm alive or not.
[02:51:12.388 --> 02:51:14.649]  You judge it off of, do I tell the truth?
[02:51:14.709 --> 02:51:18.571]  Am I accurate 95, 96, 97, 98% of the time?
[02:51:19.252 --> 02:51:20.873]  Have I been on air almost 30 years?
[02:51:21.933 --> 02:51:24.255]  And what does your gut, what does your spirit tell you on top of that?
[02:51:24.735 --> 02:51:31.619]  Plus, the idea that if Alex Jones was for real, he'd be dead is a loser mentality.
[02:51:31.779 --> 02:51:35.322]  I trust in God and I'll be alive as long as God wants me to be alive.
[02:51:36.328 --> 02:51:37.649]  Plus, I understand history.
[02:51:37.989 --> 02:51:50.054]  Garrison, the DA in New Orleans who exposed the fact that they really assassinated Kennedy and got all those congressional hearings going and totally exposed the system and got sued by CIA operatives and won.
[02:51:50.274 --> 02:51:54.076]  He said, I'm alive because I stay in the sunshine and I'm out in the open.
[02:51:54.096 --> 02:52:01.459]  They threatened his family, they attacked him, they did all these terrible things, but he kept fighting and so that's why I'm still here.
[02:52:01.859 --> 02:52:02.780]  But there's another big reason.
[02:52:04.141 --> 02:52:09.026]  Not just being the sunshine, God of course is the main reason, but also because there's so many good people.
[02:52:10.006 --> 02:52:17.734]  That's why when I see Tucker Carlson in the last 10 years get more and more awake, or Joe Rogan, or countless others, or Glenn Beck starting to get, you know, really totally woke, I mean...
[02:52:19.298 --> 02:52:22.661]  When I see stuff like that, that's not competition for me.
[02:52:22.781 --> 02:52:23.541]  I get excited.
[02:52:23.962 --> 02:52:25.803]  That's what's going to protect me and my family.
[02:52:26.184 --> 02:52:31.208]  So I've told you this a hundred times, probably this year already, and thousands of times over the years.
[02:52:31.288 --> 02:52:32.789]  My job is to become obsolete.
[02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:44.418]  My job is to turn the tide against tyranny and things be so good and people know what I know about the new world order and how to stop it and how they operate to such an extent that I have become passé.
[02:52:45.159 --> 02:52:46.740]  I have become redundant.
[02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:53.418]   I have become Where I don't even, you know, really matter anymore because it's accepted knowledge.
[02:52:54.499 --> 02:52:57.341]  So you've been attacked, you've been demonized for supporting Liberty.
[02:52:57.401 --> 02:52:58.442]  So have I. It's okay.
[02:52:58.882 --> 02:53:00.964]  God's watching and that's all that matters.
[02:53:01.024 --> 02:53:04.147]  And we've been vindicated now by the horror that's happening.
[02:53:04.247 --> 02:53:07.190]  I don't want to be vindicated anymore by more of where we know this goes.
[02:53:07.410 --> 02:53:08.471]  We have their own documents.
[02:53:08.491 --> 02:53:09.692]  We have Operation Lockstep.
[02:53:10.013 --> 02:53:11.434]  We have the Spars event.
[02:53:11.794 --> 02:53:12.475]  We have it all.
[02:53:13.916 --> 02:53:20.261]   And then separately, There's so many great people like Mercola and countless others that have been awake as long as I've been, or longer.
[02:53:21.022 --> 02:53:28.351]  And so there's millions of people, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, who all are understanding what's happening and now they're speaking up more than ever.
[02:53:28.391 --> 02:53:30.153]  So, all of you are the answer.
[02:53:31.094 --> 02:53:32.336]  All of you speaking out are the answer.
[02:53:32.816 --> 02:53:35.752]   And separately, We're helping so many people.
[02:53:35.792 --> 02:53:37.675]  The corporations aren't all bad.
[02:53:37.875 --> 02:53:38.916]  The government's not all bad.
[02:53:38.996 --> 02:53:40.077]  It's just people like us.
[02:53:40.678 --> 02:53:41.799]  It's who's in control at the top.
[02:53:41.819 --> 02:53:46.625]  So we have a lot of friends in the system as well who don't want to see Alex Jones dead or put in prison.
[02:53:47.206 --> 02:53:48.107]  Or Owen put in prison.
[02:53:48.127 --> 02:53:51.250]  But they're sure as hell trying to get rid of jury trials for us.
[02:53:51.290 --> 02:53:52.772]  So we're at the tip of the spear.
[02:53:53.653 --> 02:53:55.575]  I am consciously trying to be as good as I can.
[02:53:55.635 --> 02:53:57.016]  I'm a fallen creature, though.
[02:53:57.256 --> 02:53:58.397]  Fall short of the glory of God.
