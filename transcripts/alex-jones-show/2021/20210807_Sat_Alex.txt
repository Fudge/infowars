[00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.641]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:23.844]  It's Saturday, August 7th, 2021.
[00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:42.114]  And I'm already extremely excited about the four huge interviews you're about to see that are so vital to waking up humanity and that are streaming out to our radio and TV affiliates that will also be archived at freeworldnews.tv.
[00:00:42.894 --> 00:00:44.155]  Welcome to this Saturday
[00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:47.354]  InfoWars Emergency Transmission.
[00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:51.336]  And remember, you are the Paul Reveres, you are the men and women in the arena.
[00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:56.219]  It's when you get excited and you share this information that it has its biggest effect.
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.080]  Now get ready for this.
[00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:07.004]  It's shocking that they're pushing an experimental injection that is a gene therapy that doesn't work and makes people super sick.
[00:01:07.805 --> 00:01:14.008]  It's incredibly shocking that 95% of the people sick and dying in Israeli hospitals, their government admits
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.962]  Took the vaccine, and it's the vaccine doing it, not the Delta variant.
[00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:25.928]  And it's the same numbers in Australia, same numbers in Gibraltar, same numbers in Iceland, same numbers in Singapore.
[00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:26.628]  It's incredible.
[00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.770]  Upwards, well it's 99 plus percent in Australia.
[00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.153]  One person is in the hospital in Australia that didn't have the vaccine.
[00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:37.136]  All the other dead and dying, and thousands in the hospital took the shot.
[00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:39.517]  That's massive.
[00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:42.780]  And we're going to cover it in the interviews that we just shot.
[00:01:44.346 --> 00:01:47.689]  But sometimes InfoWars is not tomorrow's news today.
[00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:58.457]  And I cannot believe that what I'm about to lay out here is in the huge spending bill and only got attention on Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:01:58.817 --> 00:01:59.878]  And I didn't watch last night.
[00:01:59.898 --> 00:02:00.719]  I watch most nights.
[00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.964]  And so today I'm up here shooting these interviews and the crew's like, hey, have you seen this article on InfoWars.com?
[00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:09.306]  And I said, no.
[00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:13.229]  And then I went and watched the Tucker Carlson piece that we're about to show you a piece of.
[00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:16.685]  And then I went and looked at the bill, and it's all true.
[00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:22.446]  Now remember, Tucker Carlson's the bad guy for telling you about this.
[00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:32.528]  There's almost no coverage, but on Twitter, and in places like The Atlantic, you know, run by the Jeffrey Epstein folks, they're saying this is wonderful and good.
[00:02:33.188 --> 00:02:34.388]  What am I talking about?
[00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.970]  Ladies and gentlemen, they have 17 extra votes they need to pass this.
[00:02:44.244 --> 00:02:50.847]  They have the votes in the House, so as we speak, they're debating it and trying to pass it right now with almost no coverage.
[00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:57.951]  This is bigger than the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 passed by three senators without a quorum on Christmas Eve.
[00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:02.116]  And again, sometimes I'm behind the curve here.
[00:03:02.136 --> 00:03:06.920]  I mean, I knew they were pushing all this stuff, but I didn't know they'd put it in a main infrastructure bill.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:18.488]  All cars will have to have a face scanner and breathalyzer to scan and see if you're angry or mean or sick or drinking to report you to the police or others.
[00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.471]  That's AI watchers controlling you.
[00:03:22.392 --> 00:03:24.434]  Making basically what the phones already do mandatory.
[00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:25.696]  Or these home assistants.
[00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:26.917]  That's one small piece.
[00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:37.187]  Making it federal law that men can be in women's sports and in women's bathrooms, including your little girl's showers when they're eight years old at YMCA.
[00:03:37.528 --> 00:03:38.349]  But it gets even worse.
[00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:50.583]  It makes it a hate crime and illegal to question the CDC and what they say is an official scientific pronouncement when science is all about asking questions and we have our First Amendment right to do it.
[00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:54.926]  And you've seen the Justice Department say they want to start going after people that question lockdowns.
[00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:58.108]  That's in the new terrorism directive from two months ago by Biden.
[00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:01.610]  Well now they're trying to put that into law.
[00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:06.514]  And I didn't just believe Tucker Carlson, even though he's a friend of mine, he tells the truth, and really smart.
[00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:08.055]  Something this big, I went
[00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:11.264]  I read the bill and the sections.
[00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:17.268]  The bill is 2,700 pages long, but I went to the subsections and it's all true and it's worse than that.
[00:04:17.348 --> 00:04:19.789]  So, there's even more than what I just told you.
[00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:30.117]  We're going to go to the clip of Tucker Carlson, the full piece of him and his monologues on InfoWars.com and the article, and then we've got David Icke, Dr. Stephen Greer, Robert Barnes, and then
[00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:49.824]  Big tech whistleblower, individual known very well to me, very successful, top guy, who's not using his full name yet, he's going to go public soon, but he came on and laid out what's really in these so-called vaccines and how it's creating the digital plug into our body to be AI monitored in their own documents.
[00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:58.106]  This is a huge, huge Saturday broadcast, and I'm very thankful that so many of you tune into these and share these.
[00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:00.227]  When you get excited, it gets three million views.
[00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.227]  When you don't, it gets a million.
[00:05:01.748 --> 00:05:03.889]  Still, that is amazing on an independent platform.
[00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:07.731]  We're going to restream it to our affiliates as well, but this is so important.
[00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.132]  And again, usually we're way ahead of the curve.
[00:05:10.152 --> 00:05:14.294]  I already knew about their whole agenda here, but this is AI takeover of our lives.
[00:05:15.302 --> 00:05:19.205]  This is so evil to tax you by the mile and so much more, and we've got to come together and say no.
[00:05:19.466 --> 00:05:26.972]  This is a globalist revolution against the individual, a big tech complete takeover, and the heart of it is these digital IDs.
[00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:33.598]  Once they get the digital ID, the vaccine passport, that's your financial cashless society system, that's your social credit score.
[00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:36.941]  People are finally getting that, and the UN and others admit that's the plan.
[00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:40.754]  So this is a lot bigger than just making sure you, quote, have these dangerous vaccines.
[00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:44.436]  This is about totally controlling every facet of your life.
[00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.658]  And Klaus Schwab and others admit that.
[00:05:46.698 --> 00:05:51.621]  And once they've got that, they can incrementally totally control every aspect and consolidate control.
[00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:54.943]  And remember, their end game is total depopulation.
[00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:57.805]  So let's take action together and share the live feed link.
[00:05:57.905 --> 00:06:07.292]  And once this is posted at freeworldnews.tv, share this video because history is happening and an authoritarian revolution has struck at humanity.
[00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:10.914]  Joe Biden's infrastructure bill is winding its way through the Senate.
[00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:35.219]  A lot going on.
[00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:40.881]  You may have missed this, but you should know it is moving without meaningful Republican opposition.
[00:06:41.482 --> 00:06:45.163]  That means, unless something changes very soon, it will become law.
[00:06:45.343 --> 00:06:46.583]  Here's what you should know about that bill.
[00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:49.785]  It's 2,700 pages long.
[00:06:49.985 --> 00:06:52.206]  It will cost more than a trillion dollars.
[00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:54.426]  It will not pay for itself, despite what they told you.
[00:06:55.007 --> 00:07:03.570]  And much of it has nothing whatsoever to do with infrastructure, meaning fixing our crumbling roads and bridges and airports and train stations and all the rest.
[00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.431]  That embarrasses Americans.
[00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.092]  Instead, this bill will make science denial official.
[00:07:09.252 --> 00:07:12.254]  It will enshrine gender identity in federal law.
[00:07:12.854 --> 00:07:15.355]  It would allow the government to track your driving.
[00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:15.715]  Why?
[00:07:15.755 --> 00:07:18.437]  So they can charge you a fee for every mile you go.
[00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:20.818]  This in addition to the gas tax.
[00:07:21.718 --> 00:07:31.309]  And scariest of all, this bill requires all new vehicles in the United States to come with monitoring technology, such as eye scanners or breathalyzers.
[00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:38.156]  And that means that going forward, you will need the express permission of your federal overlords before you start your car in the morning.
[00:07:38.597 --> 00:07:39.538]  Because it's their car now.
[00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:44.861]  As of tonight, 20 Republican senators appear to support this lunacy.
[00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:50.148]  The final vote is this weekend, so if you have views about this, you might want to let them know right away.
[00:07:50.728 --> 00:07:54.233]  They assume you're not paying attention, so they can do whatever they want to you.
[00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:55.354]  And in this case, they are.
[00:07:56.255 --> 00:08:02.277]  Here are the 17 Republicans who have already voted to move this bill forward, listed in alphabetical order.
[00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:22.003]  Roy Blunt, Richard Burr, Shelley Moore Capito, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, Kevin Cramer, Mike Crapo, Lindsey Graham, of course, Chuck Grassley, John Hoven, Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, Rob Portman, Jim Risch, Mitt Romney, Tom Tillis, and Todd Young.
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.162]  Now, a few of these people plan to retire soon, thank heaven.
[00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:29.465]  But most of them intend to get re-elected at some point.
[00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:32.988]  And it might be good if voters made that impossible.
[00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:47.259]  We, and our like around the world, are going to go down in history.
[00:08:51.682 --> 00:09:01.050]  As the people that brought freedom back from the brink just as the light was going out.
[00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.114]  This is not a time for us to hide.
[00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:16.602]  It's a time to stiffen the backbone and to reach a point of mental strength
[00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:22.082]  Well, we will not capitulate a inch to these people.
[00:09:24.683 --> 00:09:38.486]  This is a time, my friends, my beautiful, beautiful friends, when we no longer think of consequences for doing what we know to be right.
[00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:41.127]  We just do it.
[00:09:44.788 --> 00:09:55.733]  In the months and the two, three years ahead, they are going to invoke a onslaught upon us.
[00:09:56.494 --> 00:10:01.276]  An onslaught upon those who are awakening.
[00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:03.557]  Those who can see.
[00:10:05.018 --> 00:10:11.201]  And they are going to try to destroy us and destroy our spirit.
[00:10:12.864 --> 00:10:23.568]  By making it impossible, they think, to work, to do anything that we call human life.
[00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:39.215]  And they are going to invoke, as foot soldiers, the fast asleep, to demonize us, incessantly, with their brain-dead media.
[00:10:40.308 --> 00:10:45.970]  And the demonic social media internet giants.
[00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.631]  But we must not bow.
[00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:53.632]  We must not capitulate.
[00:10:53.652 --> 00:11:01.574]  All over the world, the awakened ones, the ones who can see,
[00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:06.494]  We come together now and we do not fail.
[00:11:06.974 --> 00:11:08.275]  We will not fail.
[00:11:08.355 --> 00:11:10.897]  If I promise you anything, I promise you this.
[00:11:11.518 --> 00:11:20.445]  We will get through this and we will have a special world full of special people on the other side.
[00:11:20.845 --> 00:11:22.987]  We are going to win this.
[00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:41.473]  And we will do it as one human family, with one heart and one goal.
[00:12:01.735 --> 00:12:12.319]  Well, first of all, among those who have seen it and can see it, we have to move from seeing it to ceasing to cooperate with it.
[00:12:12.499 --> 00:12:16.621]  I mean, you know, people say, Alex, that knowledge is power.
[00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:17.541]  It's not.
[00:12:18.381 --> 00:12:20.902]  The use of knowledge is power.
[00:12:21.463 --> 00:12:24.864]  Knowledge unused is knowledge not worth having.
[00:12:24.984 --> 00:12:27.405]  Lockdowns are not meant to end.
[00:12:28.044 --> 00:12:30.246]  Mask mandates are not meant to end.
[00:12:30.606 --> 00:12:48.518]  Nearly all of what I do now is focused on encouraging the awakened not to concede, not to submit, you know, to the point where they go, look, we've done our best, but I can't do this and I can't do that and I can't do the other unless I do what they say and get the jab or whatever.
[00:12:49.538 --> 00:12:57.644]  But the point I would strongly make to people is that the consequences of submission are
[00:12:58.226 --> 00:13:08.433]  Infinitely, infinitely more sinister and nightmarish than the consequences of ceasing to cooperate and refusing to submit.
[00:13:08.793 --> 00:13:12.976]  All right, we've got him for a commercial free interview in the next hour.
[00:13:12.996 --> 00:13:15.498]  The iconic David Icke is with us.
[00:13:16.098 --> 00:13:19.761]  I was just talking to him before we started taping, and he said, it's time to unify humanity.
[00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:22.043]  The enemy is about to throw everything they've got at us.
[00:13:22.503 --> 00:13:23.664]  So I said, hey, please stop, David.
[00:13:23.684 --> 00:13:30.309]  Repeat all that to the audience out there about this historic time we're in, where everything he's talked about and I've talked about is coming out in the open.
[00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:39.416]  World government, world ID, force inoculations, emergency detainment camps, helicopters and drones flying around saying, you can't be at the park.
[00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:42.878]  Clydesdale horses running over women.
[00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:48.361]  I mean, this is 1984, and it's just going to get worse until, as he says, humanity get off your knees.
[00:13:48.722 --> 00:13:54.785]  David Icke, bestselling author, researcher, thank you so much for coming on, and please lay out where you see the world today.
[00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:57.026]  Always a pleasure, Alex.
[00:13:57.766 --> 00:14:06.191]  Well, you know, I've been doing this now for 31 years, and you go through all the names, dates, places, information, absolutely vital.
[00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:31.748]  That people know that and I still do that and you know I've gone through many other areas of this whole conspiracy but you know the more that I have looked at it the more it breaks down into a very simple situation and basically it's a tussle, well more than a tussle, between two basic states of consciousness.
[00:14:31.888 --> 00:14:36.029]  Obviously there's differences between them and there's you know different
[00:14:36.796 --> 00:15:03.383]  uh mixtures between them but but basically it's it's two states of consciousness and I started scanning the the ancient world and I was looking and looked at the religions and what they say uh and the the cultures that are not you know strictly religious and you see an amazing common theme and that is of a state of consciousness manifesting you know personified in
[00:15:04.306 --> 00:15:07.727]  Groups, secret societies, individuals, etc.
[00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:13.868]  That is seeking to manipulate and enslave humanity from the shadows.
[00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:23.251]  And so, if you look at what Christians believe, they talk about the devil, Satan, and they talk about the demons.
[00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:28.632]  Then you look at the Gnostic belief system, which is not mainstream Christian.
[00:15:29.346 --> 00:15:36.311]  And they call the devil Yoda Beoth, and they call the demons Archons, which is a Greek word meaning rulers.
[00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:43.235]  Then you look at what the Islamic faith says about the manipulations of the jinn from the unseen.
[00:15:43.936 --> 00:15:48.059]  And then I came across more recently, and I talked about this in
[00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:56.563]  In a new book, Perceptions of a Renegade Mind, which the last chapter of it is called Escaping Wetiko.
[00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:57.864]  I'll explain why in a sec.
[00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:01.828]  And I think that's one of the most important chapters I've ever written in a book.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.641]  Why Wateco?
[00:16:03.701 --> 00:16:09.385]  Because the Cree tribal people in America have the concept of what they call Wateco.
[00:16:09.445 --> 00:16:10.366]  And what is Wateco?
[00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:14.709]  Wateco is the Cree version of this manipulative force.
[00:16:15.209 --> 00:16:18.712]  They describe it as an inverted, chaotic,
[00:16:21.508 --> 00:16:32.960]  distorted state of consciousness that's seeking to impose itself upon the target population and change the perceptions and therefore the actions.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.721]  Where does behavior come from?
[00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:39.026]  It comes from perception of the population.
[00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:54.514]  And because this, what's eco as I will call it, operates in a narrow band and a very dense low band of frequency, which relates to low vibrational human emotion, fear, anxiety, depression, all these things.
[00:16:55.475 --> 00:17:05.818]  If they can pull the population into those low states of being, of perception, through not least fear, which is its greatest weapon,
[00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:16.644]  Then they can attach, connect frequency-wise to the population and they can feed perceptions that people have.
[00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:19.188]  They can, for instance, shut off
[00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:30.801]  The critical thinking processes, it's like fire walling, you know, and so you've got the the super what he calls who are the full blown psychopaths.
[00:17:31.302 --> 00:17:42.894]  And when you look at the traits of what he called under other names and different cultures and religions, you're looking at the psychopaths running this covid hoax and indeed running this whole global conspiracy.
[00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:49.177]  You're looking at your Gateses and your Fouches and your Klaus Schwartz and all these other people.
[00:17:49.197 --> 00:17:52.120]  You're looking at your Rockefellers and your Rothschilds.
[00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:54.103]  These are super psychopaths.
[00:17:54.183 --> 00:18:00.190]  And if you look at the traits of psychopaths through what they call the hair test, named after the guy that came up with them,
[00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:03.775]  And if you've got enough of these traits, you are officially a psychopath.
[00:18:04.155 --> 00:18:06.657]  Well, the top two are lack of empathy and lack of compassion.
[00:18:07.137 --> 00:18:17.504]  So you have a situation where these people have, because of their lack of empathy and lack of compassion, have no emotional consequence, no matter what they do.
[00:18:18.124 --> 00:18:26.089]  So people will look at your vouchers and your Gateses and all these other people, and they'll say in the COVID era, no, no, that can't be true.
[00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:27.270]  They would never do that.
[00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.511]  No, no, no, no, mate.
[00:18:28.671 --> 00:18:28.931]  No, mate.
[00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:30.412]  You would never do that.
[00:18:31.377 --> 00:18:33.559]  They would do it and not really that get off on it.
[00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:37.922]  So this is, it's classic Watiko personified through these people.
[00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:42.385]  And David, let me just interject one quick question because I was thinking of Fauci before you said his name.
[00:18:42.846 --> 00:18:52.253]  I've been watching him in these TV pieces he's doing for TikTok for children, not just over 12, but below that getting him ready for this deadly
[00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:58.157]  GMO injection and he's smiling and laughing and looks like a vampire out of a movie.
[00:18:58.878 --> 00:19:12.528]  Just so revolting to anybody that's awake looking at him like a Brian Stelter or this woman, this former head of Planned Parenthood that's saying we can't trust the public, people can't have food or leave their houses unless they take the shots.
[00:19:13.088 --> 00:19:20.134]  I mean these are villains out of a Hollywood movie and they're just gleeful so you say they don't care but actually you go deeper into this.
[00:19:20.894 --> 00:19:22.496]  They actually enjoy hurting people.
[00:19:22.516 --> 00:19:23.376]  It's not just they don't care.
[00:19:24.337 --> 00:19:25.238]  Yeah, no, of course.
[00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:27.120]  That's the point I've just made.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.023]  Not only don't they care how they treat people, they get off on it.
[00:19:31.604 --> 00:19:33.906]  And they get off on it because of who they are.
[00:19:33.926 --> 00:19:39.611]  I mean, psychopaths get off and get enjoyment from control of other people.
[00:19:39.651 --> 00:19:42.874]  And the more that other people suffer and fear them, the more they get off on it.
[00:19:44.175 --> 00:19:47.138]  And so, you know, I talk about these people in that
[00:19:47.904 --> 00:20:00.115]  In the Trafalgar Square speech I made a week or so ago, I'm openly calling these people demons now, because that's what they are, you know, they're beyond psychopaths, they're demons, they're in the, you know, the biblical sense of demons.
[00:20:01.135 --> 00:20:05.119]  And so you've got this Wotiko, which is demonic.
[00:20:06.254 --> 00:20:13.597]  What the creed called, which is demonic, and these people are its expressions, they are its physical expressions.
[00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:28.104]  This global cult that I talk about, this network of secret societies with a central dictating mission control operating the global agenda, that's why it plays out globally.
[00:20:28.925 --> 00:20:38.735]  This cult is Wutiko made manifest, and the traits of this Wutiko come out in things like Satanism.
[00:20:38.755 --> 00:20:42.338]  You see, what this Wutiko is, it's an inversion of life.
[00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:49.566]  You know, I refer to evil as the absence of love, and evil is the word live written backwards.
[00:20:50.186 --> 00:20:51.748]  It's anti-life, it's an inversion.
[00:20:52.188 --> 00:20:59.535]  And because it's an inversion, everything that it manifests in human society is an inversion.
[00:20:59.695 --> 00:21:06.042]  So, for instance, in the name of protecting health, this Covid era has fricking destroyed it.
[00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:13.409]  And in the name of protecting health, these fake jabs are destroying it on a scale.
[00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:15.611]  When we go through the next
[00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:20.607]  months and two years is going to be absolutely catastrophic and monumental.
[00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:22.448]  So, everything's an inversion.
[00:21:22.488 --> 00:21:30.993]  So, if you look at Satanism, for instance, which is an expression of Wetiko, then you look at their symbolism, it's all inversion.
[00:21:31.493 --> 00:21:41.439]  They invert the cross, they invert the pentagram, they invert their symbols, because the whole thing is an inversion of life.
[00:21:41.499 --> 00:21:43.500]  This is why they're so obsessed with death.
[00:21:44.392 --> 00:21:46.893]  They do their rituals in churchyards and stuff.
[00:21:47.434 --> 00:21:49.855]  They are obsessed with death, which is an inversion of life.
[00:21:50.215 --> 00:21:51.676]  This is what's behind it.
[00:21:52.016 --> 00:21:54.797]  But then if you come down, they're the super psychopaths.
[00:21:54.817 --> 00:21:58.979]  They're the ones that absolutely, colossally, Wateko made manifest.
[00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:01.500]  Your Gateses and your Swabs and all these other people.
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.481]  But then you come down one.
[00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:11.865]  Another trait of psychopaths, Wateko, is that you lie as much as it's necessary to lie to get what you want.
[00:22:12.774 --> 00:22:16.396]  So now we're looking at the mainstream media and Silicon Valley.
[00:22:17.416 --> 00:22:26.460]  I mean, you know, we both know going way back, I mean, I worked in the media, that the media bloody lies and it distorts.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.843]  But I've never seen the global scale of coordinated
[00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:39.597]  Script reading distortion and lies that have come from the global media that we've had in the last 18 months.
[00:22:39.617 --> 00:22:42.079]  You coined the term, I remember like 20 years ago, repeaters.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:47.485]  Explain, you used to have the top BBC show, how talking points would go out but still you could have your own view.
[00:22:48.106 --> 00:22:52.251]  But in the last 10 years or so it's completely, you get scripts and then they just
[00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:53.551]  Yeah, but the global cult
[00:23:22.626 --> 00:23:47.949]  It's like a spider's web, and each strand of the spider is either an exclusive secret society right in the shadows next to the spider, or it's a secret society that we've heard of, or it's the cusp organizations like the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission etc., Club of Rome, the environment manipulators, and then you come out into the mainstream of society
[00:23:48.288 --> 00:23:48.368]  Yes.
[00:24:04.987 --> 00:24:07.168]  Organizations and businesses, etc.
[00:24:07.608 --> 00:24:17.191]  So, the banking system appears not to be connected to Silicon Valley, but if you go into the web level, they're fundamentally controlled by the web, they're for the same people.
[00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:23.733]  And so you have this connection in the COVID era that is so blatant.
[00:24:24.133 --> 00:24:31.099]  Where the World Health Organization, which is completely controlled by the cult, it's a cult front.
[00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:37.263]  It was created by the Rockefellers, among others, as part of the UN, which is another cult organization.
[00:24:37.604 --> 00:24:41.026]  And then you've got Silicon Valley and they're all cult organizations.
[00:24:41.066 --> 00:24:44.429]  Your Facebook's and I mean Zuckerberg is running Facebook.
[00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:45.290]  That's hilarious.
[00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.172]  And it's the cults running these things.
[00:24:48.472 --> 00:24:51.534]  So what you get through this coordination is the
[00:24:52.555 --> 00:25:06.630]  The understanding of apparent mysteries and contradictions because you think, why did Silicon Valley come out and say really early on that they're going to censor anyone challenging the World Health Organization version of the COVID hoax?
[00:25:07.591 --> 00:25:09.573]  Because, why would they do that?
[00:25:09.894 --> 00:25:10.955]  On the face of it, would you do that?
[00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:17.357]  You do that if the cult owns the World Health Organization and it owns the Silicon Valley corporations.
[00:25:18.037 --> 00:25:23.082]  And going on from that to what I was saying a few minutes ago, it owns the global media.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.943]  This cult owns the global media and it's at this level of this web.
[00:25:28.403 --> 00:25:30.704]  And by the way, let me just stop you again because you're dead on here.
[00:25:31.224 --> 00:25:35.567]  You started saying 25 years ago, there'll be a moment of a merger.
[00:25:35.907 --> 00:25:38.909]  There'll be a global awakening by 2016 of populism.
[00:25:39.229 --> 00:25:41.691]  You said this hundreds of times, probably 10 times on my show.
[00:25:42.071 --> 00:25:48.395]  You said, by 2016, I see the lines converging at a global pushback by free humanity, a big awakening, which happened.
[00:25:48.775 --> 00:25:54.717]  Then that gets co-op, and you said the big battle starts around 2020 or so, just from all your studying.
[00:25:54.757 --> 00:25:56.057]  That's now happened.
[00:25:56.077 --> 00:26:05.200]  They're striking back with everything you've got, but it is a revolving door from big pharma, big tech, big media, big banks, big academia, all the same people.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.141]  And I always, from my study, saw the Rockefeller, the Carnegie Endowment, and others
[00:26:10.017 --> 00:26:29.515]  And the Cecil Rhodes groups, which you're an expert on, right at the center of this, and now they've kind of removed Gates as the front man, and we see the Rockefeller Foundation is now officially in control of UN, WHO, IMF, World Bank, and U.S.-European policy on the, quote, virus rollout.
[00:26:29.575 --> 00:26:33.559]  So it looks like they've gone from beta into operational with this COVID.
[00:26:33.599 --> 00:26:34.240]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:26:35.017 --> 00:26:37.239]  Yeah, well, I mean, Gates was always a front man.
[00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:39.280]  I mean, you know, is there life on Bill Gates?
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.361]  I see no evidence.
[00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:42.603]  He was a front man, just like Zuckerberg.
[00:26:42.963 --> 00:26:43.403]  Ditto.
[00:26:43.484 --> 00:26:44.965]  Is there life on Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:45.705]  I see no evidence.
[00:26:46.826 --> 00:26:49.348]  But it's the people in the shadows that are calling the shots.
[00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:54.192]  But if we go to the global media and we're related to this Wotico, what is the global media doing?
[00:26:54.392 --> 00:27:02.198]  It's lying by the hour, actually, by the minute, to advance the agenda of the psychopaths, the psychopaths that are Wotico.
[00:27:03.128 --> 00:27:06.990]  And what is another trait of psychopaths in the hair test?
[00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:15.915]  What I said earlier, the ability to lie as much and as outrageously as necessary to get what you want.
[00:27:16.315 --> 00:27:19.416]  So the whole global media has been witty cold.
[00:27:19.776 --> 00:27:20.617]  So there is no
[00:27:23.692 --> 00:27:24.032]  I think?
[00:27:49.551 --> 00:28:03.636]  And, you know, people who have awakened, I say awakened from Wachiko, the Wachiko coma, they are putting their hands on their head and they're saying, why can't these people see it?
[00:28:04.096 --> 00:28:05.477]  Look, look at the evidence.
[00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.037]  Why can't they see it?
[00:28:07.558 --> 00:28:14.180]  But, you know, if you firewall a computer, it's not going to see parts of the Internet because it's not going to process that information.
[00:28:14.941 --> 00:28:33.090]  And we're seeing this clear, obvious division between those that I say are Watiko attached, who simply have lost, if they ever had it, the ability to process information into a conclusion.
[00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:43.475]  So what an awakening person does is they take information and they process that information into a conclusion, which is unique to them most of the time.
[00:28:44.102 --> 00:28:50.726]  The sleep rather, the ones in the COVID coma, they don't have that ability.
[00:28:51.406 --> 00:28:57.209]  What they do is they take not only the information, but the information becomes an opinion.
[00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.192]  So they're not processing the information into a conclusion.
[00:29:01.512 --> 00:29:03.453]  The information is their opinion.
[00:29:03.573 --> 00:29:04.073]  And that's key.
[00:29:04.113 --> 00:29:05.714]  They take it on, it becomes their identity.
[00:29:05.814 --> 00:29:08.736]  And then when you attack the lie, they see it as you're attacking them.
[00:29:09.827 --> 00:29:22.667]  Yeah, because, you know, we all know everybody watching this this this interview will know of and had the experience of people saying, I'll tell you what my opinion is of what's going on.
[00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:29.644]  And then what comes out of their mouth is basically the official narrative, word for word, because it's not their opinion.
[00:29:29.924 --> 00:29:35.827]  They've taken their opinion and they repeat what their opinion has been told to be.
[00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:51.074]  So, you know, if you, if you, what this Watiko seeks to do, I have looked at this in great detail, not only, you know, the name Watiko, but long before in other different names around the world for the same, you know, state of consciousness.
[00:29:51.883 --> 00:29:57.793]  And what it seeks to do is isolate people in the five senses.
[00:29:58.814 --> 00:30:06.587]  Isolate people in the five senses and the subconscious levels immediately around the five senses, but basically to put them in a five sense bubble.
[00:30:07.142 --> 00:30:10.224]  And from that perspective, people say, can I see it, touch it, taste it?
[00:30:10.824 --> 00:30:18.889]  And you've been saying that for 30 years, and now they admit in their own documents at Facebook, they want you alone with bots that you interact with, no human connection.
[00:30:19.229 --> 00:30:23.071]  And what a diabolical evil plan that they admit they're doing.
[00:30:23.511 --> 00:30:24.872]  How do we get people out of the bubble?
[00:30:25.272 --> 00:30:26.413]  How do we get them out of the trance?
[00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:32.857]  And how do we explain to some of the mercenaries that work for the system that they're destroying their own future by going along with this?
[00:30:34.002 --> 00:30:42.629]  Well this is what I'm coming to, you know, if you firewall a computer, use the same analogy again, then it's not going to process the information you've firewalled it from.
[00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:59.002]  And these people are so programmed, so manipulated in their perceptual state, so isolated in the five senses, that they are not going to see it until they expand their awareness beyond the five senses.
[00:30:59.402 --> 00:31:01.264]  And all the pressure is not to do that.
[00:31:01.924 --> 00:31:16.140]  So what happens is when you start to open your mind and let consciousness in, more expanded consciousness, not someone in a spaceship, your own consciousness, which the five sense bubble is shutting out, then you start to see things.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.103]  You see, look at what the five senses do, Alex.
[00:31:19.443 --> 00:31:22.466]  They see the world as everything apart from everything else.
[00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:23.848]  That's how they decode reality.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.763]  And so the five senses alone are never going to connect dots.
[00:31:28.184 --> 00:31:29.345]  They're only going to see dots.
[00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:32.588]  They're not going to see patterns and pictures and how it all fits together.
[00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:36.632]  It's expanded consciousness beyond the five senses that does that.
[00:31:37.502 --> 00:31:44.685]  And so if you can keep people in the five senses, they will see a world of random events and random happenings.
[00:31:44.725 --> 00:31:46.465]  They'll be completely confused.
[00:31:46.505 --> 00:31:48.846]  They won't be able to understand anything that's going on.
[00:31:49.186 --> 00:31:53.708]  So their guide to what's going on will be the official pronouncements from government.
[00:31:53.908 --> 00:31:58.349]  And that's a great example of how the media will say a cop did something wrong, burn down your own neighborhood.
[00:31:58.369 --> 00:32:02.191]  And the people wonder why they don't have shops a year later and why they don't have jobs anymore.
[00:32:02.451 --> 00:32:03.831]  They're not putting two and two together.
[00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:05.312]  They're not playing even checkers.
[00:32:05.772 --> 00:32:07.313]  Yeah, but the other thing about this whole
[00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:43.293]  situation with Wateko and having your consciousness, because what Wateko seeks to do is to isolate the five senses from expanded awareness, because then it's gotcha.
[00:32:43.593 --> 00:32:52.256]  Because if you can isolate the five senses, then it can feed the five senses with a version of reality, which the five senses just take on because it's got no other source.
[00:32:52.276 --> 00:32:53.356]  And then it can fully capture you.
[00:32:54.056 --> 00:32:54.816]  Yeah, and then they gotcha.
[00:32:54.856 --> 00:32:55.316]  They gotcha.
[00:32:56.157 --> 00:32:56.617]  They gotcha.
[00:32:56.677 --> 00:32:58.277]  You're basically a possessed mind.
[00:32:58.317 --> 00:33:00.158]  You're a computer terminal on their internet.
[00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:00.818]  That's what you are.
[00:33:01.958 --> 00:33:12.728]  And so that is controlling the way that massive numbers of the population are perceiving reality, and you see this in various ways.
[00:33:13.088 --> 00:33:20.415]  First of all, the inability to see the obvious, which the awakened can see, and they go, why can't they see it?
[00:33:20.515 --> 00:33:21.696]  That's why they can't see it.
[00:33:22.097 --> 00:33:23.858]  Why would an ethical attached mind
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.463]  It's beyond Swiss cheese, it's beyond Swiss cheese.
[00:33:49.962 --> 00:33:52.363]  That's why they have to go in for this mass censorship.
[00:33:52.724 --> 00:33:55.345]  It's not because, oh, we're powerful, we're going to censor.
[00:33:55.605 --> 00:33:58.986]  They have to censor because their narrative is so ludicrous.
[00:33:59.307 --> 00:34:00.687]  That was my next question.
[00:34:00.707 --> 00:34:03.369]  Let's talk about the big rallies, millions of people around the world.
[00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:06.370]  Let's talk about how do we get people out of this mindset because you predicted
[00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:11.412]  As there would be a global awakening, there would be a move to oppress us and literally control our five senses.
[00:34:11.452 --> 00:34:13.732]  That is literally their entire operation.
[00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:14.713]  They're desperately trying it.
[00:34:15.193 --> 00:34:17.854]  You've said now is the crossroads, now is the time to stand up.
[00:34:17.954 --> 00:34:25.597]  Speak to some of that for folks and then tell the world please, in your clear vision, where we're going if we don't say no.
[00:34:25.617 --> 00:34:27.697]  Because I think now it's clear we're already there.
[00:34:27.717 --> 00:34:28.538]  1984 on steroids.
[00:34:30.812 --> 00:34:32.013]  Yeah, I'll come to that.
[00:34:32.033 --> 00:34:35.734]  I'll just finish this point about this Wateco mine.
[00:34:36.154 --> 00:34:46.418]  If you've noticed that when you push back, maybe a family member, maybe it's one family member in a family, and they've all bought the COVID, you know, narrative, and one doesn't.
[00:34:47.098 --> 00:34:50.640]  I saw a doctor telling this very story the other day about his experience.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.201]  They don't just say, I don't agree with you.
[00:34:53.261 --> 00:34:56.302]  I mean, family members, they don't just say to you, well, I don't agree with you.
[00:34:57.068 --> 00:35:02.971]  They cut you off, they ostracize you, they ignore you, they demonize you.
[00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:10.815]  This doctor said, you know, I started talking out about, you know, the lies that were being told and my family cut me off.
[00:35:11.435 --> 00:35:11.635]  Right.
[00:35:11.996 --> 00:35:15.017]  So that's not rational.
[00:35:15.457 --> 00:35:16.438]  It's not rational.
[00:35:16.578 --> 00:35:21.000]  And it's not the kind of thing that would happen very much before the Covid era.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:21.981]  So why is that?
[00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:26.103]  Because if you have a Wutiko controlled mind, then
[00:35:27.315 --> 00:35:34.537]  You are going to be encouraged to demonize those that are pushing back on what is the Wetiko agenda, although they know that.
[00:35:34.657 --> 00:35:49.880]  And I've also noticed the worse it gets for the people captured by the Spider or the Wetiko program, the more they double down and the more they hate those of us that aren't in that spirit and they want to destroy us, I guess because they're slowly becoming that entity.
[00:35:50.834 --> 00:35:52.275]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:52.295 --> 00:35:56.456]  It is absolutely a case of assimilation.
[00:35:56.876 --> 00:36:02.158]  And the more you fall into these Wateco frequencies, the more power it has over you.
[00:36:02.499 --> 00:36:16.664]  And so what you're going to see, of course you're going to see, you're already going to see it, is that the asleep, what I say, of being Wateco'd, they are going to en masse be used as foot soldiers to attack those who are awakened.
[00:36:16.724 --> 00:36:18.685]  That's right, a giant army is being prepared.
[00:36:19.332 --> 00:36:21.594]  Yeah and what does awakening mean?
[00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:35.885]  It means you awaken from the Watiko frequencies, you awaken from the five senses and at that point you start to see pictures and patterns and connections and not just unconnected random dots.
[00:36:36.645 --> 00:36:41.009]  So this is the whole point, going on to the point you've just made, is that
[00:36:42.145 --> 00:36:48.068]  Those of us, and the number is growing and it's far, far bigger than people realize.
[00:36:48.088 --> 00:36:56.873]  For every, you know, hundreds of thousands now walk through the streets marching in protest and in favor of freedom through the streets of London.
[00:36:57.153 --> 00:37:03.316]  And for every one of those people, there's a lot more who couldn't make it to the march but think the same.
[00:37:03.396 --> 00:37:06.177]  So, you know, this is happening, it really is.
[00:37:07.018 --> 00:37:09.379]  But with that gift of seeing
[00:37:10.143 --> 00:37:11.445]  Comes responsibility.
[00:37:11.945 --> 00:37:12.726]  Simple question.
[00:37:12.786 --> 00:37:16.390]  Who's going to push back on this and who's going to bring it down and who's going to stop it happening?
[00:37:16.971 --> 00:37:18.072]  Well, the psychopaths aren't.
[00:37:18.092 --> 00:37:18.833]  They're making it happen.
[00:37:19.522 --> 00:37:42.547]  The government administration people and health administration people who've been through, I explained this in Perceptions of a Renegade Mind, a massive decades-long reframing, that's what they call it, reframing mind program, perception programming, so they'll be the unquestioning yes-sir, no-sir administrators of the psychopathic agenda and the people who are fast asleep
[00:37:43.207 --> 00:37:46.029]  And attacking everyone who's not, they're not going to do it.
[00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.990]  So how do we counter it?
[00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:47.791]  How do we stop it?
[00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:49.972]  Because clearly this has already gone off the edge.
[00:37:49.992 --> 00:37:51.233]  They're operational now.
[00:37:52.174 --> 00:37:53.054]  Where do you want to tackle that?
[00:37:53.094 --> 00:37:54.475]  Where we're going if we don't stop it?
[00:37:54.735 --> 00:37:56.056]  How you think the battle's going?
[00:37:56.116 --> 00:37:57.237]  What you think we should do?
[00:37:57.918 --> 00:37:59.939]  Just all of the insanity that's taking place?
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:10.927]  Well, first of all, among those who have seen it and can see it, we have to move from seeing it to ceasing to cooperate with it.
[00:38:11.545 --> 00:38:15.947]  I mean, you know, people say, Alex, that knowledge is power.
[00:38:16.187 --> 00:38:16.847]  It's not.
[00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:20.209]  The use of knowledge is power.
[00:38:20.789 --> 00:38:24.211]  Knowledge unused is knowledge not worth having.
[00:38:24.791 --> 00:38:32.294]  So it's not just about seeing it and then, oh no, I told you, I told, hey, I told you that what happened and I know, I told you this was coming next.
[00:38:32.835 --> 00:38:35.096]  Well that, okay, okay, well done.
[00:38:35.536 --> 00:38:37.917]  But what are you going to do about it?
[00:38:38.493 --> 00:38:46.341]  And the whole point of what you've been doing and I've been doing all these years is to alert enough people so there is an intervention to stop it happening.
[00:38:46.641 --> 00:38:47.682]  Not to be proved right.
[00:38:47.883 --> 00:38:49.064]  Oh yeah, he was right, he's right.
[00:38:50.525 --> 00:38:53.428]  Actually, you don't want to be proved right because you don't want it to happen.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.021]  To do that, you have to have an intervention.
[00:38:57.141 --> 00:39:15.267]  And now we're at this point, I mean, talk about a crossroads or a fork in the road, where if we do go on being spectators, even seeing spectators, never mind asleep spectators, then we are going to live in a global fascist dictatorship that would make George Orwell wince.
[00:39:16.348 --> 00:39:23.651]  And, you know, what is this AI when you think about it, this connecting AI to the human brain and the human body?
[00:39:24.551 --> 00:39:24.691]  It's
[00:39:25.845 --> 00:39:35.006]  But taking over the human perceptual processes so that they are forever enslaved in the five senses.
[00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.263]  So there is no connection to greater consciousness.
[00:39:39.283 --> 00:39:42.926]  You completely isolate them using AI, and this is the end game.
[00:39:43.366 --> 00:39:55.395]  All along, like I said, it's been a case of the foundation of the conspiracy is isolating the five senses from expanded states of awareness, and AI is going to give you the end game.
[00:39:56.075 --> 00:39:59.758]  But you know, I've always been confident
[00:40:04.198 --> 00:40:05.439]  That this is going to end.
[00:40:05.779 --> 00:40:10.341]  I'm going to a bit of esoteric stuff here, but this is my fix on where we're going.
[00:40:12.323 --> 00:40:22.028]  First of all, the next two to three years are going to be brutal, because this Wotico, and it's all its expressions and your swabs and all these other people.
[00:40:22.549 --> 00:40:27.591]  Your Rockefellers are going to throw everything at us and they're going to use the asleep to do it.
[00:40:27.651 --> 00:40:47.878]  And this is why, you know, nearly all of what I do now is focused on encouraging the awakened not to concede, not to submit, you know, to the point where they go, look, we've done our best, but I can't do this and I can't do that and I can't do the other unless I do what they say and get the job or whatever.
[00:40:48.919 --> 00:40:51.780]  But the point I would strongly make to people
[00:40:52.526 --> 00:41:07.817]  is that the consequences of submission are infinitely, infinitely more sinister and nightmarish than the consequences of ceasing to cooperate and refusing to submit.
[00:41:08.538 --> 00:41:14.542]  You know, I look at Trump supporters, you know, apparently 74 million voted for Trump at the last election.
[00:41:15.022 --> 00:41:21.207]  And the overwhelming number of those 74 million, overwhelming, if not in virtually all of them,
[00:41:21.867 --> 00:41:29.232]  But instead, Trump is not pushing back.
[00:41:29.332 --> 00:41:30.252]  That's the big thing.
[00:41:30.533 --> 00:41:35.516]  He could lead us out of this nightmare right now by saying, I was wrong, they conned me, the vaccine doesn't work.
[00:41:36.056 --> 00:41:36.636]  It's a fraud.
[00:41:36.676 --> 00:41:38.377]  But instead, he's tied to it.
[00:41:38.397 --> 00:41:39.318]  But I want you to finish your point.
[00:41:39.338 --> 00:41:40.939]  But that's, that's key right there.
[00:41:40.959 --> 00:41:42.520]  And I'm guessing where you're going with this.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.282]  That's my extreme frustration with Trump is that, where is he?
[00:41:46.422 --> 00:41:47.083]  What is he doing?
[00:41:48.086 --> 00:41:54.028]  Yeah, well, you know, in Perceptions of a Renegade Mind, I use the phrase, Save Me Syndrome.
[00:41:54.649 --> 00:42:00.771]  And I think, you know, when we're looking at 74 million people, and I have enormous respect for those people.
[00:42:01.091 --> 00:42:02.512]  I'm not knocking them.
[00:42:02.552 --> 00:42:03.853]  I have enormous respect for them.
[00:42:04.313 --> 00:42:07.814]  And what I don't want is for them to be led to glorious failure.
[00:42:07.934 --> 00:42:11.216]  I want them to reach glorious victory in all this.
[00:42:11.236 --> 00:42:12.036]  That's what I want.
[00:42:12.671 --> 00:42:25.275]  And you know, if we go on giving out, it don't matter what the individual is, I don't care if it's Trump or anybody, but if we go on looking for a saviour, when the saviour is looking back at us from the mirror,
[00:42:25.993 --> 00:42:29.675]  Then we're going to be, all the time, giving our power.
[00:42:29.775 --> 00:42:30.635]  I mean, cue and on.
[00:42:30.775 --> 00:42:31.576]  Trust us.
[00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.056]  Listen, I just wrote it on my page.
[00:42:33.156 --> 00:42:35.337]  I just wrote, cue, right here.
[00:42:35.377 --> 00:42:45.622]  I was about to ask you, cue, you and I got criticized a lot a year and a half ago, two years ago, six months ago, right before this, eight months ago, warning that this was a disinfo op to the Save Me Syndrome.
[00:42:45.862 --> 00:42:47.423]  So we're not spiking the football here.
[00:42:47.823 --> 00:42:51.965]  How did David Icke smell that that was a fraud from day one in an intelligence operation?
[00:42:53.328 --> 00:42:55.369]  Well, because I've been doing this for 31 years.
[00:42:56.110 --> 00:43:06.277]  When QAnon came up with the, you know, trust the plan and all the, you know, the good guys are going to arrest the bad guys and all this is going on, I thought, well, bloody deja vu or what?
[00:43:07.077 --> 00:43:14.622]  I've come across over the last 31 years about two or three other organizations that just appeared and basically said the same thing.
[00:43:15.463 --> 00:43:22.788]  I mean, some of them, I went into one in one of my books in detail because they had people giving the dates that they were going to arrest the bad guys.
[00:43:23.562 --> 00:43:25.524]  And I'm thinking, well, why are you telling them?
[00:43:27.487 --> 00:43:27.987]  Just do it.
[00:43:28.127 --> 00:43:29.429]  But of course, they weren't going to do it.
[00:43:29.449 --> 00:43:30.850]  The dates passed and the dates passed.
[00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:41.643]  And of course, the Soviets did that to round up their opposition in the 1920s, the Bolsheviks with Operation Trust, which was the even same terms that Q used were the exact same thing the Bolsheviks used.
[00:43:42.523 --> 00:43:46.464]  Yeah, I mean, it's straight off the script of the ages.
[00:43:46.985 --> 00:43:56.048]  So, I mean, going back to the 74 million, what if the 74 million didn't look to Trump or someone else to save them, but ceased to cooperate with their own enslavement?
[00:43:56.208 --> 00:43:57.268]  It'd be over for the globalists.
[00:43:58.129 --> 00:44:02.570]  You imagine what a spanner that would throw into the works.
[00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.051]  No, I'm not shutting the business.
[00:44:04.091 --> 00:44:05.531]  No, I'm not wearing a mask.
[00:44:05.571 --> 00:44:05.971]  No, I'm not.
[00:44:06.052 --> 00:44:07.212]  There's 74 million people.
[00:44:08.142 --> 00:44:11.444]  I mean, you know, you would throw a big spanner in the works.
[00:44:25.271 --> 00:44:31.653]  All lockstep, all the nations of the world, Rockefeller Foundation running it, the GrubSpot and the Rockefeller Foundation running that.
[00:44:31.833 --> 00:44:35.414]  Why are they so desperate to get this injection in the arm?
[00:44:35.454 --> 00:44:37.614]  And from your deep research, what is it really doing?
[00:44:37.634 --> 00:44:40.635]  Because now they admit almost everybody dying are the folks that took it.
[00:44:41.135 --> 00:44:42.255]  It's making people super sick.
[00:44:42.315 --> 00:44:44.016]  It's getting rid of their immune system, as you said.
[00:44:44.356 --> 00:44:52.658]  Whatever the virus was or wasn't or does exist or didn't exist, what is the whole project to get this GMO thing in people's arms?
[00:44:54.085 --> 00:44:57.446]  Yeah, well, I have this phrase, know the outcome and you'll see the journey.
[00:44:58.127 --> 00:45:03.248]  And if you don't know the outcome, then the daily journey could seem like random events.
[00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:08.030]  But when you know the outcome, the daily events become stepping stones to the outcome quite clearly.
[00:45:08.611 --> 00:45:12.332]  So as you said, lockdowns are not meant to end.
[00:45:12.952 --> 00:45:15.033]  Mask mandates are not meant to end.
[00:45:15.926 --> 00:45:30.125]  Because the idea is complete control and the destruction of all independent business and employment to make the population dependent on the state and make that all commerce and everything controlled by giant corporations owned by the cult.
[00:45:30.706 --> 00:45:39.093]  So if anyone thinks, well, you know, just a little bit more and we'll just conform a little bit more and then maybe it will be all right, you know, because we come in out of the Covid.
[00:45:39.414 --> 00:45:39.974]  No, we're not.
[00:45:40.535 --> 00:45:52.945]  We're going into the next extreme level of it because this is this is the situation, Alex, I would say, is that, of course, we've been talking for years about the mass depopulation agenda.
[00:45:53.266 --> 00:45:54.567]  There's two things going on here.
[00:45:55.067 --> 00:45:58.450]  Part of it is mass depopulation, just simply killing people.
[00:45:58.976 --> 00:46:00.057]  through these fake jabs.
[00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:05.861]  And the other part is those that survive will have their genetics completely transformed.
[00:46:06.622 --> 00:46:11.606]  And and so part of it is to is to kill people and enormous numbers of people are going to die.
[00:46:11.626 --> 00:46:13.307]  Unfortunately, I don't like saying it, but they are.
[00:46:14.308 --> 00:46:27.298]  And on the other side, you've got this magnetic nanotechnology self replicating, which is designed to connect people into the smart grid, those who survive and those who go through this genetic transformation.
[00:46:28.399 --> 00:46:28.499]  And
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:43.065]  So, in this period through the fall, as you call it in America, autumn here, and winter of 2021 into 2022 and through to 2023, enormous numbers of people, it's already started, mate, isn't it?
[00:46:43.145 --> 00:46:46.426]  Of course it has, are going to die because of the fake vaccine.
[00:46:46.886 --> 00:46:50.087]  Now, what they're going to have to do is find other reasons to explain that.
[00:46:50.347 --> 00:46:53.088]  And now, as you said, they've started blaming the unvaccinated.
[00:46:54.207 --> 00:47:06.977]  Well, that was absolutely predictable because the unvaccinated or the unfit vaccinated are those that can see, those who are awake, and thus they're the only people that can bring this lockdown down.
[00:47:06.997 --> 00:47:12.601]  And we also noticed government people and higher-ups, it turns out, are being given saline all over the world.
[00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:16.224]  So this thing has been caught taking saline and they go, oh, it's a mistake.
[00:47:17.369 --> 00:47:21.032]  Well, you know, of course, that's going to happen.
[00:47:21.052 --> 00:47:24.534]  I mean, if you know what's in these fake vaccines, you're not going to have them, are you?
[00:47:25.315 --> 00:47:29.258]  That's why, you know, on one level, you've got the censorship so people don't know what's in them en masse.
[00:47:29.318 --> 00:47:33.701]  And then you've got the people in the upper echelons who absolutely know what's in them and they're not going to have them.
[00:47:34.822 --> 00:47:40.587]  And I think that quite a few in the population have had saline as well, because I think, you know, they don't want to kill everybody.
[00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:45.211]  You are now going to face this.
[00:47:45.231 --> 00:47:49.293]  Yes, part of it is going to be they're going to say it's the it's the unvaccinated.
[00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.794]  They're causing this, but they've got to explain it away.
[00:47:52.814 --> 00:48:04.300]  So what they're doing at the moment, you see, is they're saying when they have to, that the vaccinated, the fake vaccinated are ending up in hospital with Covid.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.800]  Oh, it's Covid, you know.
[00:48:06.381 --> 00:48:07.081]  No, it's not.
[00:48:07.621 --> 00:48:09.543]  They are not in hospital with COVID.
[00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:11.284]  How do you know they've got COVID?
[00:48:11.564 --> 00:48:14.226]  Well, we tested them with a test not testing for it.
[00:48:14.286 --> 00:48:16.008]  Yes, that's how you know they've got COVID.
[00:48:16.268 --> 00:48:19.530]  They're in frickin' hospital because of the effect of the bloody vaccine.
[00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.292]  And again, you got taken off YouTube a year ago.
[00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:25.615]  They said specifically for saying the PCR test was a fraud.
[00:48:25.855 --> 00:48:28.177]  They've now removed it and said it was 100% fraudulent.
[00:48:28.377 --> 00:48:30.639]  The whole basis of all of it, the whole foundation of lie.
[00:48:31.704 --> 00:48:35.586]  Yeah, and you know, just to finish this point, I want to come back to that.
[00:48:37.667 --> 00:48:40.688]  You are going to see, you're probably going to almost certainly see the flu come back.
[00:48:40.989 --> 00:48:41.789]  Oh, flu's come back!
[00:48:42.409 --> 00:48:49.713]  And you're going to see the variants of the variant, variant, variant, variant, variant, variant, which is more deadly and more transmissible.
[00:48:50.053 --> 00:48:57.201]  In other words, people are dying from the fake vaccine, so we've got to have a reason that suits our agenda for why they're dying.
[00:48:57.281 --> 00:48:58.403]  Oh, it's COVID variants.
[00:48:58.543 --> 00:49:06.792]  Oh, and that means that the original COVID fake vaccines are not working on the variants, because people are still dying, even though they've been vaccinated.
[00:49:06.812 --> 00:49:10.977]  So we need more vaccines for the variants, which are already sitting there waiting to go ahead.
[00:49:12.198 --> 00:49:20.323]  In September, starting September 2nd in Britain, and of course the CDC are moving in that direction in America and around the world, is happening as well.
[00:49:20.863 --> 00:49:29.489]  We're going to have the vulnerable, this is old people and people with other conditions that they actually want rid of, they're going to have a third booster.
[00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:34.772]  Fake vaccines, so many are going to be taken out and they're going to be calling it, the cause is other things.
[00:49:39.922 --> 00:49:44.788]  This is what we're going to face and it's going to be very important that those that are awake
[00:49:46.457 --> 00:49:56.001]  Hold their backbone stiff and hold their resolve and don't go under because if they do, then... It's a trap.
[00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:57.621]  The more you give in, the worse it gets.
[00:49:57.681 --> 00:49:58.201]  You've seen that.
[00:49:58.241 --> 00:50:00.362]  They said, oh, the vaccinated, you're going to be free.
[00:50:00.382 --> 00:50:01.262]  You don't have to wear a mask.
[00:50:01.302 --> 00:50:03.423]  And now they're like, no, actually, the vaccinated are spreading it.
[00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:04.804]  You're the worst.
[00:50:05.164 --> 00:50:10.806]  And so you've got to take more because obviously they're a compliant group that the wolves are going to focus on because they've shown they're weak.
[00:50:11.246 --> 00:50:15.090]  But repeat what you said at your speech, or some of it, last week.
[00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:15.810]  It was powerful.
[00:50:16.131 --> 00:50:20.275]  But also, before we went on air today, you were explaining, Alex, this is the crossroads.
[00:50:20.595 --> 00:50:21.616]  People better get up.
[00:50:21.656 --> 00:50:22.557]  They better take action.
[00:50:22.577 --> 00:50:23.237]  That's my message.
[00:50:23.257 --> 00:50:26.240]  Because I was saying, hey, whatever you want to cover, what do you want to get into first?
[00:50:26.961 --> 00:50:36.310]  I mean, just please reiterate that to folks that really respect what you're saying, that this is serious, and that we've all got to really, really put our will against this system.
[00:50:38.533 --> 00:50:51.658]  Well, quite simply, if you have the fake jab, you're either accepted a death sentence or your genetics are going to be transformed down the road of synthetic rather than biological.
[00:50:51.718 --> 00:50:52.598]  That's the whole point.
[00:50:53.259 --> 00:51:07.044]  And the more that people have these fake vaccines, like the variants and boosters, the more they are committing suicide and changing, if they survive, the nature of their body.
[00:51:07.424 --> 00:51:20.530]  And the other point about the vaccine passport, by the way, it's an absolute trap because they're saying, well, you can go to this and you go to that and you go to the other and the unvaccinated can't if you've had the two jabs.
[00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:22.251]  OK, fine.
[00:51:22.451 --> 00:51:23.611]  OK, that's outrageous.
[00:51:23.671 --> 00:51:24.972]  But let's look at that.
[00:51:25.492 --> 00:51:29.134]  Oh, and then, oh, if you haven't had the booster,
[00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:31.330]  You lose your vaccine passport.
[00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:41.118]  If you haven't had this new fake vaccine for this fake variant, then you have lost your vaccine passport.
[00:51:41.158 --> 00:51:49.564]  Because once you're on that road of the vaccine passport, you're going to have to top up what they say you must have to keep the vaccine passport.
[00:51:49.785 --> 00:51:50.946]  This is the trap.
[00:51:51.506 --> 00:51:57.511]  And going back to that point you made earlier, you know, I've been saying since the
[00:51:59.793 --> 00:52:01.695]  Spring of 2020, there is no virus.
[00:52:01.975 --> 00:52:05.218]  And all these months later, I see no evidence of any virus.
[00:52:05.238 --> 00:52:06.639]  All the evidence I've seen is that not.
[00:52:07.619 --> 00:52:11.803]  And I see all the, you know, the diversions and, you know, get them to go here, get them to go there.
[00:52:12.443 --> 00:52:14.065]  I've seen no evidence that there is a virus.
[00:52:14.425 --> 00:52:17.988]  But we've reached the point where it don't really matter if there is or there isn't.
[00:52:18.627 --> 00:52:25.010]  The justification for whether there's virus or not virus, the justification of it is the jab.
[00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.830]  That's it.
[00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.571]  The bioweapon is the jab.
[00:52:28.091 --> 00:52:34.694]  And even if you accept that this virus exists, look at the figures.
[00:52:35.514 --> 00:52:44.658]  What they say is that the infection, quotes, to death rate of it is between, I've seen, 0.23 to 0.15 percent.
[00:52:47.620 --> 00:53:10.471]  Now what I would say to people is okay you accept that yeah okay and you think there's a virus yeah okay now take from the 0.23% and the 0.15% whichever one you accept all the fake cases with a test not testing for the virus take that away and then take away all the people
[00:53:11.474 --> 00:53:12.695]  Who have died.
[00:53:13.515 --> 00:53:15.956]  Bizarrely, it's the way they do it.
[00:53:16.477 --> 00:53:23.160]  Within 28 days or more of a test not testing for the virus, and instead of what you've died from going on your death certificate, COVID-19 does.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:28.783]  Take that away, because it's included in those figures, take that away from the 0.23% and the 0.15%.
[00:53:28.843 --> 00:53:29.163]  What's left?
[00:53:29.183 --> 00:53:29.283]  Zero.
[00:53:33.283 --> 00:53:33.704]  Zero.
[00:53:34.544 --> 00:53:38.388]  And, you know, it's in our face that this is not what they say.
[00:53:38.408 --> 00:53:43.452]  And by the way, David, I really respect you and basically everything you've ever said comes true, so I'm not denying it.
[00:53:43.472 --> 00:53:47.476]  So help me walk through this for others that ask me this on the street and on the show constantly.
[00:53:48.217 --> 00:53:51.279]  What are they doing in all these giant bio-weapons labs around the world?
[00:53:52.199 --> 00:53:52.479]  I don't
[00:54:08.404 --> 00:54:08.544]  Yes.
[00:54:28.377 --> 00:54:29.357]  We're good to go.
[00:54:58.231 --> 00:54:59.712]  It's the fake vaccine.
[00:55:00.032 --> 00:55:08.735]  I mean, you know, I always find that if you take a breath and take a step back and calmly look at it from a panoramic perspective.
[00:55:08.755 --> 00:55:09.396]  I totally agree.
[00:55:09.516 --> 00:55:10.996]  Obviously, it is the vaccine.
[00:55:11.016 --> 00:55:12.777]  Almost all the deaths are people that are vaccinated.
[00:55:12.857 --> 00:55:14.858]  I understand what I'm saying is it's contagious.
[00:55:15.538 --> 00:55:17.659]  It's attacking people's hearts and lungs that haven't taken it.
[00:55:17.699 --> 00:55:21.781]  People, women that have sex with their boyfriend are losing their uteruses.
[00:55:22.082 --> 00:55:27.605]  I mean, it's, the hospitals are full of people, young people having heart attacks because their mom got the shot.
[00:55:27.705 --> 00:55:29.005]  I mean, it's real.
[00:55:29.546 --> 00:55:33.768]  So exactly what you said last year about it won't be the so-called virus, it'll be the shot.
[00:55:34.128 --> 00:55:35.829]  I'm saying, what are they rolling out?
[00:55:36.129 --> 00:55:37.090]  How bad is it going to get?
[00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:40.952]  Because it's not just people that have taken the shot, it's people that are around them.
[00:55:42.182 --> 00:55:56.045]  Well, like I say, you know, if you look at it from a panoramic point of view, they are putting synthetic genetic nanotechnology material that is self-replicating into the body.
[00:55:56.645 --> 00:56:02.186]  And almost, if you've got half a brain cell on active duty, Alex, you don't really need to know much more.
[00:56:02.346 --> 00:56:04.567]  I mean, how does anyone think that's going to turn out?
[00:56:05.254 --> 00:56:18.957]  And you've got this obvious situation with shedding, which may be shedding or it may be simply people being affected by what that body is now broadcasting.
[00:56:18.977 --> 00:56:23.899]  Because this nanotechnology, the self-replicating nanotechnology, is broadcasting frequencies.
[00:56:24.399 --> 00:56:27.739]  And if you get close to them, you're going to be hit by those frequencies.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:33.061]  You know, I've heard doctors talk about the fact that people have come to her and said,
[00:56:34.622 --> 00:56:35.222]  Thank you.
[00:57:04.907 --> 00:57:25.083]  And there's going to be some very, very, very hard choices because if people are in partnership, you've just mentioned it, if people are in partnership with someone and they're having sexual relations with them and one is fake vaccinated and one isn't, well the other one who isn't is going to be fundamentally affected by the other one.
[00:57:25.163 --> 00:57:27.405]  I know relationships that have broken up on that.
[00:57:27.505 --> 00:57:32.849]  They've said, oh no, sorry, no more, I'm out of here because I can't, I'm not going to get what you've got.
[00:57:33.369 --> 00:57:58.543]  So, you know, we are being challenged on a massive scale and we are going to see, we are seeing this division of society between the awakened and the fast asleep and they are two very different societies and it's so important that people form groups together, support groups, so that the fake or the non-fake vaccinated
[00:57:58.983 --> 00:58:09.266]  Can interact and be picked up and encouraged and supported and people in families that have ostracized them can have another family, the awakened family.
[00:58:09.706 --> 00:58:14.588]  It's happening in Britain, it's happening where I live on this Isle of Wight just off the south coast of England.
[00:58:14.628 --> 00:58:23.731]  Those things are organically happening but they need to happen much quicker because the pushbackers or the not acceptors of the official narrative
[00:58:24.526 --> 00:58:28.992]  It's going to be brutal in the attacks on us in the next while.
[00:58:29.012 --> 00:58:29.773]  I totally agree.
[00:58:30.494 --> 00:58:34.199]  In fact, get back into what we talked about before you went on air today.
[00:58:34.239 --> 00:58:37.444]  You were saying, Alex, the next two to three years, they're going to throw everything at us.
[00:58:37.804 --> 00:58:38.765]  You said, I want to talk about that.
[00:58:38.785 --> 00:58:41.950]  What do you expect him to throw at us on top of all of this?
[00:58:44.181 --> 00:58:45.842]  Well, they're going to isolate us.
[00:58:46.162 --> 00:58:48.004]  I mean, they're already talking about food and everything.
[00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:52.987]  They're going to isolate us from everything that is necessary to function.
[00:58:53.327 --> 00:58:56.770]  And we have to be ingenious in responding to that.
[00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:10.479]  And, you know, what tends to happen, I've had this in my life anyway, that if you make a decision that you're not going to do something and you're not going to cooperate,
[00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:15.604]  There would seem to be consequences for that, of doing that.
[00:59:16.385 --> 00:59:22.029]  But if you stick by it, things tend to happen where those consequences can be overcome.
[00:59:22.369 --> 00:59:23.169]  Doors open!
[00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.970]  Doors open!
[00:59:25.051 --> 00:59:26.352]  Yeah, are the doors open?
[00:59:26.412 --> 00:59:27.212]  Absolutely right!
[00:59:28.073 --> 00:59:32.676]  Because this is the point, you know, I've made this point in talks and books over the years.
[00:59:33.357 --> 00:59:39.581]  If you have a series of doors, but you're only focused on one,
[00:59:40.555 --> 00:59:40.896]  I think?
[00:59:55.635 --> 00:59:59.838]  And that's what I found in my life, is that when they do the worst stuff to me,
[01:00:20.891 --> 01:00:23.573]  And I just turn it over to God and just relax and zen out.
[01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:27.616]  Then the best stuff then happens right then, but you've got to step through those doors.
[01:00:28.036 --> 01:00:33.880]  And so that's why they think they're trying to build a system that's copying whatever I think the organic system is.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:44.046]  I think that's what these archons, these creatures, I mean, obviously they want to play God or play what built this because there's a real system out there.
[01:00:44.347 --> 01:00:45.588]  We know about dark matter.
[01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:50.691]  We know about, they now confirm that there's five times more energy holding our universe together.
[01:00:51.472 --> 01:00:55.415]  Well, just after the turn of the millennium, I got intuitively so strongly.
[01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:14.308]  Because a lot of the stuff comes to me through that means.
[01:01:15.469 --> 01:01:19.570]  Because intuition is your connection to higher levels.
[01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:20.610]  100% I get it too.
[01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:21.851]  It gets more intense every day.
[01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:28.013]  I got that we live in a fake reality, which is simulation.
[01:01:29.374 --> 01:01:33.495]  And that the walls of the simulation are the speed of light.
[01:01:34.907 --> 01:01:49.099]  And back in May, I think it was, a scientific American ran an article by some guy with letters after his name saying that the evidence pointed to the fact that we live in a simulation and its outer limit is the speed of light.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.143]  It's all these years later and it is.
[01:01:53.723 --> 01:01:56.325]  The speed of light is not the fastest speed, it's pedestrian.
[01:01:56.706 --> 01:02:03.031]  But note that if any scientist comes out with claims that the speed of light is not the fastest speed of light, the roof comes down on them.
[01:02:03.651 --> 01:02:06.512]  Because the matrix operates within the speed of light.
[01:02:06.572 --> 01:02:11.133]  The electromagnetic spectrum, what we call light, electromagnetic light.
[01:02:11.493 --> 01:02:15.354]  And you said that 25 years ago, and now the head of Bank of America believes it.
[01:02:15.534 --> 01:02:19.115]  All the major scientists now go, okay, there's something holding this together.
[01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.275]  But let's be clear, you don't believe we're a simulation.
[01:02:21.755 --> 01:02:25.676]  They've created a simulation to try to tie us down and control the inputs.
[01:02:26.516 --> 01:02:29.397]  Yeah, basically the simulation controls perception.
[01:02:30.674 --> 01:02:33.157]  And it gives a sense of limitation for a start.
[01:02:34.097 --> 01:02:39.102]  And this is the point that I would make, and I do have enormous evidence for this from personal experience.
[01:02:39.802 --> 01:02:42.364]  Please speak on it, speak on it!
[01:02:42.424 --> 01:02:57.357]  Beyond the walls of the simulation, the speed of light, and by the way, that's why things go very strange when you get to the, you know, when you get to the speed of light, things get very strange, time changes, everything changes, because time actually is a manifestation of the simulation.
[01:02:57.797 --> 01:03:05.542]  There is a, the world beyond, or reality, infinity beyond the simulation is in a no time now.
[01:03:05.642 --> 01:03:08.924]  It's very difficult to get your head around that when you're perceiving time all the time.
[01:03:08.944 --> 01:03:13.566]  But it is a no time world, where everything happens at the same now.
[01:03:14.067 --> 01:03:18.429]  But, so, when you get to the speed of light, everything starts to change.
[01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:19.110]  Why?
[01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:22.032]  Because you're reaching the edge of this simulation.
[01:03:23.292 --> 01:03:25.734]  You remember in the Truman Show, when
[01:03:26.733 --> 01:03:39.620]  Jim Carrey's character eventually realizes that he's in a fake reality and he finds the edge of the dome and he goes out and he opens the door and he walks out.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:51.486]  Well, that Truman Show set is symbolic of this simulation and it controls your sense of perception now.
[01:03:52.506 --> 01:03:53.867]  The dots connect the more we speak.
[01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:58.761]  The way we interact with this simulation is through the five senses.
[01:03:59.842 --> 01:04:01.044]  They're decoding the simulation.
[01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:11.514]  So if they hold you in the five senses, like I said earlier, which is the whole foundation of what the cults are doing, then you are in the simulation and of the simulation.
[01:04:12.095 --> 01:04:17.360]  When you go into expanded states of awareness, you go beyond the walls of the speed of light, which is pedestrian.
[01:04:18.132 --> 01:04:19.352]  I think so.
[01:04:42.359 --> 01:04:44.421]  Beyond this, the world is love.
[01:04:44.861 --> 01:04:47.202]  Where do we go when we, quote, die?
[01:04:48.143 --> 01:04:51.645]  I have this phrase, the body has a cycle, we have eternity.
[01:04:52.506 --> 01:04:57.429]  And the body cycle, the body connects us to the simulation.
[01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:05.915]  When the body cycle is over, that which has been experiencing through the body, which is consciousness, the eternal part of us,
[01:05:06.738 --> 01:05:06.898]  I think?
[01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:17.632]  Then suddenly the reality changes dramatically.
[01:05:18.112 --> 01:05:26.776]  I've read hundreds and hundreds of accounts of near-death experiences and the common themes are fantastic.
[01:05:27.437 --> 01:05:32.840]  And you go into a world that's very different from this one, a world of love and joy and bliss.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.882]  You don't meet many near-death experiences that want to come back.
[01:05:37.481 --> 01:05:41.604]  Well, let me just share this with you.
[01:05:41.624 --> 01:05:46.087]  I've reached out to God and asked God to show me the truth.
[01:05:46.127 --> 01:05:50.290]  And I've had dreams in my life before that have 100% come true that are prescient.
[01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:52.371]  So I know that we're faster than light.
[01:05:52.391 --> 01:05:54.392]  We can go to the future backwards because there is no time.
[01:05:54.432 --> 01:05:56.094]  As you said, it's all very zen.
[01:05:56.974 --> 01:06:06.376]  But I've actually had those those experiences where I know that I was at the next level, past speed of light, and it was timeless, total satisfaction, total completion.
[01:06:06.956 --> 01:06:10.616]  And I could look into the past, the future, the present, anything I wanted to.
[01:06:10.956 --> 01:06:20.338]  And I can also look into the minds of other humans, entities, whatever they were that had decided to build their own little tombs, their own little false worlds that they were contained in.
[01:06:20.878 --> 01:06:23.859]  And I could go into those and actually see what was going on.
[01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.059]  And it was I didn't want to
[01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:30.884]  Yeah, what I'm saying is don't let's get fooled by the fact that this world, this reality and what goes on in it currently and through known human history
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.941]  Thank you.
[01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:04.968]  And because Watiko is actually fear, that's what it is.
[01:07:05.068 --> 01:07:06.690]  It's that that brought fear into the world.
[01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:19.321]  That's why it uses fear and gets people into states of fear because there is then an attachment, a frequency attachment, because fear is going to attach to fear on the same frequency and the possession could take place.
[01:07:20.182 --> 01:07:27.228]  So, and this is, I think, Alex, you know, in a wider sense, this is so important that people realize
[01:07:28.081 --> 01:07:43.506]  Both those that have had the jab and the number that are going to take the consequences, and those that have not had the jab and are wondering whether they should resist or not, that, you know, whatever happens, we are going to die.
[01:07:44.606 --> 01:07:45.386]  Thank God!
[01:07:45.406 --> 01:07:48.267]  Hands up who wants to stay here forever, you know what I mean?
[01:07:48.807 --> 01:07:50.928]  So, but it's only a case of when.
[01:07:51.688 --> 01:07:56.970]  And when we die, we go into realms of absolute love and bliss and
[01:07:58.669 --> 01:08:02.311]  We would almost be unable to imagine it.
[01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:08.233]  But is it possible, Interdimensional, to get attached to the Wetiko spirit and it takes you to a bad place?
[01:08:08.253 --> 01:08:09.254]  Because I've also seen that.
[01:08:10.214 --> 01:08:12.435]  Yes, that is possible too, yes.
[01:08:13.675 --> 01:08:22.879]  And, you know, I think there are other levels of this simulation that are not, if you like, not the world that we see and interact with, but at other levels.
[01:08:23.039 --> 01:08:26.301]  In fact, wouldn't you say another level is trying to absorb this one or eat it?
[01:08:27.338 --> 01:08:30.119]  Yeah, well, you know, I've written about this in the books.
[01:08:30.159 --> 01:08:42.664]  You know, for me, what we call reincarnation is actually those that leave the body in a vibrational state that cannot get beyond the walls of the matrix.
[01:08:43.205 --> 01:08:47.966]  And they stay in it, but they stay at other levels of it, which are not the physical body level.
[01:08:48.006 --> 01:08:50.067]  There are other levels, other frequency levels of it.
[01:08:50.748 --> 01:08:52.768]  And then they reincarnate back into it.
[01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:56.590]  Because, you know, I looked at reincarnation and I thought, well, hold on a minute.
[01:08:57.461 --> 01:09:18.791]  You're asking me to believe that people choose to keep incarnating onto a planet which, compared with the projected size of the universe, is the equivalent of a billionth of a pinhead, and that you have to keep incarnating here to work your way to enlightenment to get out of it.
[01:09:19.611 --> 01:09:21.232]  Well, I mean, sorry, I don't buy that.
[01:09:21.252 --> 01:09:21.912]  It doesn't make sense.
[01:09:21.972 --> 01:09:26.214]  But what does make sense to me is that if you can't
[01:09:27.404 --> 01:09:30.909]  Reach a vibrational level that takes you beyond the walls of the matrix.
[01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:33.372]  Then you go to other levels of the matrix.
[01:09:34.573 --> 01:09:38.458]  Maybe this is the purgatory that some people talk about.
[01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:45.787]  And then you come back in and you're in this cycle of incarnation and reincarnation, not from the great beyond into this,
[01:09:47.008 --> 01:09:47.868]  Let me ask you this then.
[01:09:47.908 --> 01:09:49.869]  What are instincts and ancestral memories?
[01:09:49.909 --> 01:09:51.729]  Because I have those really intensely.
[01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:54.410]  I have a lot of smarts and instincts that I didn't learn.
[01:09:56.131 --> 01:10:01.452]  But it's not the kind of stuff we hear of like an ancient background that ancestors compressed their experiences and gave to me.
[01:10:01.832 --> 01:10:13.335]  I've got all sorts of instincts with technology and politics and life and things that I was never taught that I know that are advanced that I wouldn't see on the timeline they claim this planet has been involved in.
[01:10:14.824 --> 01:10:15.945]  Well, there's two things.
[01:10:16.485 --> 01:10:27.011]  You see, this would bring us round to where I think this is going, and actually positively going, ultimately.
[01:10:27.951 --> 01:10:37.516]  There are other levels of awareness beyond this one that are running an operation to bring this control system down.
[01:10:38.377 --> 01:10:44.320]  They're doing it through people here, which they have to, but there's a massive operation going on.
[01:10:44.884 --> 01:10:50.749]  From higher levels of awareness that are saying enough, this enough, no more, gone too far.
[01:10:51.890 --> 01:11:02.920]  And they work through people and you know, there's a massive number of people who have come into this world, some are obvious, some are less obvious, coming into this world in this period.
[01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:07.555]  Um, to, to, to, to play a part in bringing an end to all this.
[01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:11.257]  Uh, and, and they are fed information.
[01:11:11.277 --> 01:11:22.143]  See, I, I went to a psychic in 1990 and, uh, simply because I, I found, I had a presence around me throughout the year before and it got stronger and stronger.
[01:11:22.823 --> 01:11:23.964]  I wanted to see if she'd pick it up.
[01:11:23.984 --> 01:11:27.306]  Cause I would, I was, I was, what the hell is going on?
[01:11:28.264 --> 01:11:40.849]  And what she told me in the March of 1990 is that I was going to go out on a world stage and reveal great secrets, that I was going to be led to knowledge, which is exactly what happened from the day at the moment I left her front room.
[01:11:41.389 --> 01:11:46.331]  But also that knowledge would be put into my mind as well directly.
[01:11:46.551 --> 01:11:48.432]  And you just know things and you know things.
[01:11:48.452 --> 01:11:49.292]  So that's one level of
[01:11:49.884 --> 01:11:51.865]  But the other level, you talk about the ancestors.
[01:11:51.925 --> 01:11:52.905]  What is the human body?
[01:11:53.505 --> 01:11:54.205]  It's a hologram.
[01:11:54.245 --> 01:11:54.945]  What is a hologram?
[01:11:54.985 --> 01:11:58.246]  It's an energetic field, and it's an energetic field of information.
[01:11:59.067 --> 01:12:11.410]  So as that information, if you like, is passed on through what we perceive as generations in this world of fake time, you can have access in your information field.
[01:12:13.065 --> 01:12:18.747]  to information knowledge that that body has accumulated in its field.
[01:12:18.947 --> 01:12:21.588]  Not the body, because the body's buried, but the field.
[01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.409]  The field continues.
[01:12:24.809 --> 01:12:31.912]  And so this is where the obsession comes from, Alex, with the cultists interbreeding.
[01:12:32.812 --> 01:12:35.973]  Because they have a particular information field.
[01:12:36.033 --> 01:12:37.073]  It's a hybrid field.
[01:12:37.794 --> 01:12:41.195]  And they want to, A, keep it from the population, and B,
[01:12:42.236 --> 01:12:52.067]  If they procreate with the general population, then that field, which is kind of unique to them, will be diluted and eventually disappear.
[01:12:52.147 --> 01:12:57.413]  So this is why they interbreed with each other and not with the general population, overwhelmingly.
[01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.955]  I mean, the classic is royalty.
[01:12:59.924 --> 01:13:04.546]  Royalty interbreeds with itself because it's trying, you know, this, this all blue bloods keep the genes.
[01:13:04.986 --> 01:13:07.807]  Well, it's actually about holding an information field.
[01:13:07.847 --> 01:13:12.169]  And this information field, uh, is, is, is, is, is part of their armory.
[01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:16.831]  It gives them, uh, abilities and, uh, and, and, and information that's passed on.
[01:13:17.331 --> 01:13:23.639]  You look at the impact of these fake vaccines on magnetizing the body.
[01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:30.747]  You know, they talk about graphene and these other elements that are used collectively to magnetize the body.
[01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:32.328]  We've seen videos of that happening.
[01:13:32.849 --> 01:13:35.252]  Magnetize, electromagnetism,
[01:13:35.732 --> 01:13:47.360]  They're changing the electromagnetic field and you must have come across this, I certainly have many times, the number of people that say to you that someone who's had the fake vaccine, they say they're not the same person.
[01:13:48.211 --> 01:13:49.132]  They're not the same person.
[01:13:49.172 --> 01:13:53.014]  They talk about them being vacant or whatever.
[01:13:53.234 --> 01:13:58.858]  I know a lot of people personally that took it and they all look 10 to 20 years older.
[01:13:58.878 --> 01:14:06.682]  You can see it with people like Michael Rappaport who took it and now he looks 30 years older but on TV like a month later and they do.
[01:14:06.722 --> 01:14:09.504]  They seem like there's not that spark anymore.
[01:14:09.524 --> 01:14:16.068]  They're more robotic and also less, I would say even less argumentative.
[01:14:16.348 --> 01:14:17.149]  Very submissive.
[01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:28.959]  Yeah, well, one of the, like when I mentioned a few minutes ago, the word that's used to me a lot with people describing their partners or their workmates and what's happened to them is they suddenly become vacant.
[01:14:30.339 --> 01:14:40.403]  And, you know, Rudolf Steiner, who had a lot of connections and he was very esoterically advanced as well.
[01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:44.325]  He actually said 100 years ago that a vaccine was coming.
[01:14:45.089 --> 01:14:54.852]  That would be given to children at birth and it would disconnect their what I would call their five sense mind from their soul and they would become automatons.
[01:14:55.532 --> 01:15:09.516]  Now if you, if we go back to what I said earlier, if you disconnect the five senses from the influence of what you might call soul or the greater consciousness then you are basically creating an automaton because the five senses are the computer level.
[01:15:10.365 --> 01:15:16.931]  The soul is the operator sitting at the computer, guiding the computer where it wants to go and all that stuff.
[01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:27.980]  But once you, I mean, let's use the word, you have a computer virus that takes over the computer operation, and you're tapping the keyboard and banging the mouse, but nothing's happening.
[01:15:28.701 --> 01:15:30.703]  The operator's now out of the game, i.e.
[01:15:30.763 --> 01:15:30.983]  soul.
[01:15:31.687 --> 01:15:39.132]  And so the system's literally trying to hijack the body to trick the incarnate soul to do it at once or just get it out of the way?
[01:15:58.234 --> 01:15:58.835]  Get out of the way.
[01:15:59.395 --> 01:16:06.100]  So the five senses are only this left because, you know, we have a five sense mind and that has a level of subconscious.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.121]  Well, there's no doubt, David, that that's their goal.
[01:16:08.161 --> 01:16:09.002]  That's what they're doing.
[01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:13.705]  We can debate all day about who they are, what it is, but we're definitely here.
[01:16:13.766 --> 01:16:14.746]  They're out to get everybody.
[01:16:15.107 --> 01:16:21.771]  And you've got this huge split of those that are really waking up and totally get it now versus those going deeper in delusion in the last few minutes we have with you.
[01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:22.792]  And I appreciate all your time.
[01:16:25.032 --> 01:16:28.256]  Give us a summation prediction about what you think's going to unfold.
[01:16:28.336 --> 01:16:30.218]  I know most of the future now is up to what we do.
[01:16:30.538 --> 01:16:32.580]  And then tell us about your new book that I can't wait to read.
[01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:42.991]  Yeah, I don't know how much time we've got left, but I just wanted to give you what I feel is... We've got as much time as you want, but I mean, it's gracious to have you here.
[01:16:43.011 --> 01:16:45.153]  So I'm going to give you the floor for the next 5-10 minutes.
[01:16:45.173 --> 01:16:45.514]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:16:46.471 --> 01:16:56.057]  Okay, so this is how I see it unfolding, and this comes from many, many different sources, not all of them of an earthly nature.
[01:16:57.858 --> 01:17:09.124]  The body decodes information, the body-brain, within a certain band of frequency.
[01:17:09.945 --> 01:17:15.068]  And that band of frequency, through the five senses, basically relates to what we call
[01:17:16.559 --> 01:17:22.842]  So if it's form, if it's the frequency of form, the five senses will decode it.
[01:17:22.942 --> 01:17:24.323]  In other words, we will see it.
[01:17:24.983 --> 01:17:35.909]  But anything deeper into the energetic field, the frequency field, that's beyond that band of frequency, the body brain won't decode it and therefore won't see it.
[01:17:36.529 --> 01:17:44.273]  And how this manifests in our reality is that we see form and we see empty space between it.
[01:17:45.996 --> 01:17:47.697]  It's not empty space.
[01:17:48.458 --> 01:18:02.109]  If you go deeper into that field, you see what I call the field, that all form and all humans, everything is connected by a, you could visualize it as a Wi-Fi field.
[01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:08.375]  It's a field of consciousness, information, possibility, probability that we are interacting with.
[01:18:08.955 --> 01:18:11.157]  Now this cult, this Wutiko cult,
[01:18:12.483 --> 01:18:16.951]  ...wants to dominate that field, and at this level it's the field of the simulation.
[01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:30.182]  And it wants to hold the field in a low vibrational state, because that is going to influence the population, the people, the target population, to go into those low vibrational states.
[01:18:30.222 --> 01:18:39.044]  A simple thing, if you want to affect all the fish at the same time, then you don't target the fish, you target the sea, and then you've got them all.
[01:18:39.384 --> 01:18:45.465]  So it's this sea of energy consciousness that connects everything, connects all of us on a level that we can't see.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.583]  That this Wutiko cult is targeting, he wants to keep it in a low vibrational state.
[01:18:51.004 --> 01:19:08.236]  So the more that they can get people into states of fear, anxiety, depression, all these low frequencies, anger, conflict, and etc., hatred, the more they are generating that low frequency energy into the field, and that field is then affecting everybody else.
[01:19:08.837 --> 01:19:11.599]  And you feel this field all the time, you know, you can
[01:19:12.586 --> 01:19:18.129]  You can go into somewhere where this field is particularly not very nice and you kind of get the chills.
[01:19:18.349 --> 01:19:19.770]  Oh dear, what's happening here?
[01:19:20.410 --> 01:19:27.854]  You go into a place where there's been a lot of negative activity, maybe murder or whatever, and you feel, oh God, it's horrible in here.
[01:19:27.954 --> 01:19:30.036]  Oh, everybody feels it at the Coliseum in Rome.
[01:19:30.776 --> 01:19:34.578]  Yeah, what you're feeling is the effect of what happened.
[01:19:34.778 --> 01:19:39.681]  In other words, the frequencies generated by the behavior of what happened affecting the field.
[01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:56.833]  So the Wutiko consciousness wants to dominate this field and everyone that opens their heart and comes to a higher level of frequency beyond Wutiko, you open your heart, you're beyond Wutiko immediately.
[01:19:58.913 --> 01:20:07.355]  They are putting a different energy into the field and everyone that does it, the field starts to raise its frequency but this is the external
[01:20:08.582 --> 01:20:11.803]  Intervention that I've come across from various sources.
[01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:25.006]  There is an intervention happening which is, and I call this intervention, back in the first book I ever wrote after my wake up in 1991, I called it Truth Vibrations.
[01:20:25.547 --> 01:20:38.270]  This is infusing what we call love, not the love of attraction, the love that holds the whole, you know, infinity together, what we call God, is being infused into this field that we are interacting with.
[01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:45.415]  And so what's going to happen in the months left of 2021, into 2022 and into 2023, is that this Wotiko, in all its expressions, this cult,
[01:20:54.321 --> 01:21:15.253]  through governments and through all these other bodies, is going to throw everything it has to terrify the population, to enslave the population, to impact upon their frequency states, so that they hold down in this frequency, in this frequency field and generate those frequencies into the field.
[01:21:16.133 --> 01:21:19.175]  Because this, Watiko, I tell you, knows that this is coming.
[01:21:20.106 --> 01:21:29.436]  But as it comes, more and more people awaken, more and more people impact the field on a higher level, the more this love, this high vibrational energy is infused externally.
[01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:51.977]  Other than Fauci and Gates that look like they're having the time of their life, they look horrified and scared like they know something's coming and that this is all defensive what they're doing.
[01:21:52.377 --> 01:21:53.498]  So I think you're absolutely right.
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:58.922]  The word I've used many times is they are terrified.
[01:21:59.783 --> 01:22:07.889]  They are terrified of people awakening because as people awaken, the field changes and they have to control the field to hold people in five cents servitude.
[01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:11.712]  Because once you know, let me put it like this.
[01:22:13.613 --> 01:22:18.675]  If you want to hold something in a natural position, then you have to you have to keep it there.
[01:22:19.076 --> 01:22:20.036]  Let me take an example.
[01:22:20.696 --> 01:22:22.637]  You've got a ball and you've got a tank of water.
[01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:25.439]  You want to put the ball in a natural position.
[01:22:25.539 --> 01:22:28.060]  So you push it to the bottom of the tank.
[01:22:29.241 --> 01:22:30.962]  But you can't let go.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.842]  You have to keep holding it there.
[01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:41.150]  It's symbolic of this incessant programming going on all the time and this fear porn going on all the time.
[01:22:41.691 --> 01:22:47.397]  Because the moment you take your hand off it, the ball goes into its natural position, which is whoosh!
[01:22:48.211 --> 01:22:49.432]  floating on top of the water.
[01:22:50.012 --> 01:22:55.796]  And our natural state is expanded awareness, multi dimensional expanded awareness.
[01:22:56.757 --> 01:23:00.720]  And we're in a natural state by being held in the five senses.
[01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:04.823]  Well, you know, say we I mean, you know, vast numbers of humanity.
[01:23:06.294 --> 01:23:18.120]  And so what's crucial to this is controlling the frequency of the field, which is constantly suppressing the frequency of the people interacting with it, the fish in the sea, if you like.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:21.661]  So when this field changes, it's the equivalent.
[01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:27.204]  And this Watiko consciousness is diluted and weakened.
[01:23:27.264 --> 01:23:28.425]  It's been weakened all the time.
[01:23:28.465 --> 01:23:29.265]  It really is now.
[01:23:30.523 --> 01:23:30.763]  Thank you.
[01:23:47.384 --> 01:23:50.547]  And this is my time scale.
[01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:53.310]  2021, 2022, 2023, they're going to throw everything.
[01:23:53.470 --> 01:24:04.201]  They're going to try to terrify the population, demonize the pushbackers so that they conform or whatever, or get marginalized.
[01:24:04.221 --> 01:24:07.465]  2023, towards the end, you're going to start to see
[01:24:09.646 --> 01:24:16.749]  The weakening of Wateco in this second half of 2023, you're going to see the weakening of its impact.
[01:24:16.769 --> 01:24:28.174]  2024, unmistakable signs that the Wateco grip is basically fatally flawed.
[01:24:28.835 --> 01:24:35.978]  And then on the other side of that, those who have had the steadfast fortitude to stick it out,
[01:24:37.188 --> 01:24:37.248]  I'm
[01:24:53.714 --> 01:25:04.099]  Once the field is cleared of Wutiko, this low vibrational consciousness, manipulative force, then humanity will be a very different... People say, well, it's human nature.
[01:25:04.319 --> 01:25:05.379]  No, no, no, no.
[01:25:05.659 --> 01:25:08.380]  This is the nature of Wutiko humanity.
[01:25:09.101 --> 01:25:11.462]  Human nature doesn't have to be like that.
[01:25:11.742 --> 01:25:14.903]  Once Wutiko humanity becomes heart-based humanity.
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:20.141]  So, you know, big challenges, but I tell you that we are going to win this.
[01:25:20.762 --> 01:25:37.707]  We are going to come out on the other side, and not only is the world as it is going to change, we will have removed a force of evil, absence of love, that has been manipulating humanity from the shadows throughout known human history.
[01:25:37.887 --> 01:25:40.248]  It's going to be gone, and the world's going to be a very different place.
[01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:40.848]  Wow!
[01:25:40.948 --> 01:25:43.389]  Briefly expanding on that, David, I care.
[01:25:44.448 --> 01:25:56.274]  There's a clip, I'll see if I can find it and add it to this, but Klaus Schwab says so many evil things, but I saw a clip of him like two weeks ago go, we need to keep the lockdowns going for the earth and for the carbon tax.
[01:25:56.754 --> 01:25:58.715]  And he said, and the great reset is coming.
[01:25:58.755 --> 01:26:00.756]  There is anger, there is more anger.
[01:26:01.016 --> 01:26:03.958]  So he says, he basically admits the reset is meant to make you angry.
[01:26:05.299 --> 01:26:07.500]  Yeah, I mean, if you want to see Wachiko personified, I mean, it's Klaus Schwab.
[01:26:27.003 --> 01:26:30.528]  You know, I mean, he is evil on a stick, this man.
[01:26:30.949 --> 01:26:33.452]  He has no redeeming qualities.
[01:26:33.492 --> 01:26:35.895]  I mean, he's not just a minion like Gates.
[01:26:36.076 --> 01:26:37.337]  You can tell he's up there with him.
[01:26:38.098 --> 01:26:39.540]  Yeah, he's up there.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:40.542]  He's higher than Gates, yeah.
[01:26:41.169 --> 01:26:44.770]  Do we even know anybody that's in the inner circle?
[01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:47.490]  Because, I mean, I know the Royals are part of that old line.
[01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:49.911]  I don't think they're running it, but the system they built is running it.
[01:26:49.951 --> 01:26:53.171]  I mean, at the heart of this, Rothschilds, we know the Rockefellers are heavily powerful.
[01:26:53.211 --> 01:26:54.192]  I mean, who's at the heart of it?
[01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:16.637]  Well, I mean, you're getting close to the spider when you've got the spider at the center of the web, when you've got the inner core of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, yeah.
[01:27:17.078 --> 01:27:21.661]  But the inner core of the inner core, they don't put themselves on public display.
[01:27:21.701 --> 01:27:25.644]  And as I've said many times, to great ridicule over the years, but I don't care.
[01:27:26.805 --> 01:27:29.988]  The spider in the end is not human.
[01:27:30.608 --> 01:27:34.091]  And I would say the spider at its core
[01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:43.229]  is this Wateco consciousness that doesn't take form, but manifests and manipulates through form.
[01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:45.291]  And that's it.
[01:27:45.412 --> 01:27:56.463]  Once we've rid the world of that, we rid the world of everything that it has manifested, and thus the world must change dramatically from a prison to a paradise.
[01:27:57.577 --> 01:27:59.958]  All right, you hardly ever plug your stuff, but it's all amazing.
[01:27:59.978 --> 01:28:11.164]  Tell us about your last few books, the new book, how we find all of the censored David Icke information, because the only way this gets out, the only way your information gets out is when people share it via their email, text message, word of mouth.
[01:28:11.845 --> 01:28:13.666]  This is an information war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:13.686 --> 01:28:14.746]  We're saving lives here.
[01:28:15.046 --> 01:28:16.387]  This is such a moment to be alive.
[01:28:16.687 --> 01:28:18.608]  How do people find your full analysis?
[01:28:18.648 --> 01:28:25.652]  And you also do videos almost every couple of days on specific topics that I watch, my wife watches them, my family watches them, my children watch them.
[01:28:26.293 --> 01:28:26.833]  But how do people
[01:28:27.413 --> 01:28:28.373]  That just finds you here.
[01:28:28.994 --> 01:28:29.874]  How do they find David Icke?
[01:28:30.634 --> 01:28:32.855]  Well, actually, a shout out to Band Dog Video, mate.
[01:28:32.915 --> 01:28:33.975]  It's absolutely brilliant.
[01:28:34.015 --> 01:28:35.956]  I think you've done a fantastic job with that.
[01:28:36.156 --> 01:28:37.156]  That's the crew, so thanks.
[01:28:37.936 --> 01:28:44.278]  Yeah, well, congratulations to all of them because they've done a magnificent job with that platform.
[01:28:44.678 --> 01:28:50.380]  So, DavidIcke.com is the main hub where I put information on about the news and
[01:28:51.124 --> 01:28:53.585]  In context every day and videos and everything like that.
[01:28:54.705 --> 01:29:08.550]  Iconic is like an alternative Netflix and it covers the whole esoteric spectrum from what you might call conspiracy right the way across the nature of reality and everything, you know, nutrition, all of it.
[01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:18.593]  And I'm just going up to a Derby in the Midlands in a couple of days to the Iconic studio to record a 14-part series on the nature of reality.
[01:29:19.233 --> 01:29:20.114]  We're good to go.
[01:29:38.343 --> 01:29:43.744]  What the world looks like beyond the limits of human sight and how we're actually connected.
[01:29:43.784 --> 01:29:45.305]  So I'm really looking forward to that.
[01:29:45.885 --> 01:29:48.825]  And the new book is Perceptions of a Renegade Mind.
[01:29:49.786 --> 01:29:55.747]  Getting it to America has been a challenge with trying to get, you know, space on containers and the chaos that's going on.
[01:29:55.767 --> 01:29:58.828]  But it's there virtually now and you can pre-order it at DavidIve.com.
[01:30:00.435 --> 01:30:01.956]  I've done some really big books.
[01:30:01.996 --> 01:30:06.197]  This is a very focused book, Perceptions of a Renegade Mind.
[01:30:07.078 --> 01:30:08.979]  Part of it is how a renegade mind works.
[01:30:10.119 --> 01:30:11.820]  I mean, you've got a renegade mind, for instance.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:18.262]  A renegade mind is not one that critically thinks only and sees what is happening.
[01:30:18.682 --> 01:30:25.645]  A renegade mind critically thinks, sees what is happening, and then refuses to bloody cooperate with it and sets out to expose it.
[01:30:26.646 --> 01:30:31.831]  And that's the renegade mind that's going to bring this down, among these other things.
[01:30:32.872 --> 01:30:38.878]  And the one before that was The Answer, which is a massive book, which pulls together all these different subjects.
[01:30:38.918 --> 01:30:47.247]  So, you know, you do everything you can, like you do, to use every platform and every form of communication to get this across, because it is information.
[01:30:47.587 --> 01:30:49.229]  They're not censoring for a laugh.
[01:30:49.764 --> 01:30:51.325]  They're censoring because they have to.
[01:30:51.846 --> 01:30:54.909]  And that means they're terrified of information they're trying to censor.
[01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.170]  So we have to be ingenious.
[01:30:56.350 --> 01:31:04.517]  And, you know, your team have been with Bandop Video to get this information circulating.
[01:31:04.597 --> 01:31:07.039]  And, you know, it's ingenuity.
[01:31:07.059 --> 01:31:07.980]  You know, what do they say?
[01:31:08.741 --> 01:31:10.402]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:31:10.422 --> 01:31:11.163]  Absolutely.
[01:31:11.897 --> 01:31:17.681]  We've got some inventing to do in the next two to three years, but it is coming down.
[01:31:17.921 --> 01:31:18.441]  It is.
[01:31:18.461 --> 01:31:19.702]  Hold that thought, people.
[01:31:19.882 --> 01:31:20.403]  It is.
[01:31:21.704 --> 01:31:24.846]  And you said, last point, you said, it's hard to let David go.
[01:31:24.866 --> 01:31:25.646]  This is all amazing.
[01:31:25.686 --> 01:31:26.347]  It's also true.
[01:31:26.387 --> 01:31:29.529]  We can all see it and intellectually know it and scientifically prove it.
[01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:34.172]  But you say, hey, I don't want to be right in the future anymore.
[01:31:34.912 --> 01:31:35.893]  It's not about being proven right.
[01:31:35.913 --> 01:31:37.554]  It's about we know what we're talking about.
[01:31:37.594 --> 01:31:38.715]  Let's stop it now together.
[01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:39.616]  But isn't it?
[01:31:40.452 --> 01:31:51.586]  I mean, there's not a lot of people out there that I can say are my peers or maybe even my elder like you, who have been right about it all and have lived from the ridicule like I lived as well to now being vindicated.
[01:31:52.227 --> 01:31:55.270]  There's the power of that perseverance for others that are going to be ridiculed.
[01:31:56.058 --> 01:31:58.079]  And then as they see things unfold, they're going to be vindicated.
[01:31:58.099 --> 01:32:00.880]  That's so they can then have the respect of others to stop it.
[01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:02.400]  So that's the essence of leadership.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:10.163]  I think it's perception, understanding, knowing what's going to happen and being willing to get hurt up front for yourself and for your family and others.
[01:32:10.563 --> 01:32:19.767]  And so we've taken our licks and that's why I want to thank the listeners and supporters for buying your books and supporting us because, you know, we've really come through the fire together and I don't have a lot of other peers
[01:32:20.327 --> 01:32:21.288]  I don't think there are, David.
[01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:23.331]  Do we have any other peers out there at this level?
[01:32:23.652 --> 01:32:30.761]  I'm not trying to put us in some elite category, it's just I think we should recognize at some point that it's kind of like this binary situation here.
[01:32:31.081 --> 01:32:35.067]  I want to see other great leaders there are out there, just none of I don't think have gotten to this level yet.
[01:32:36.055 --> 01:32:40.736]  Yeah, well, I think there are other people out there, you know, Jeff Rents has been around a long time, etc.
[01:32:40.856 --> 01:32:47.098]  But, you know, it is a small number that have been through the whole period.
[01:32:47.978 --> 01:32:50.398]  And, you know, what you said there is absolutely right.
[01:32:52.159 --> 01:32:54.739]  It's not just knowing things, it's saying things.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:33:01.461]  And when you say them, you know, you're going to get ridiculed, you know, you're going to get abused, but you say them anyway.
[01:33:02.162 --> 01:33:06.146]  And if you don't say them, then you're not going to be proved right down the road because you haven't said them.
[01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:07.868]  It's no good then saying, well, I knew that.
[01:33:07.928 --> 01:33:09.349]  Oh, yeah, you're just saying that.
[01:33:09.469 --> 01:33:12.212]  Well, if you say it, well, you're not just saying that, are you?
[01:33:12.732 --> 01:33:17.397]  And so it's it's it's very important that people speak their truth.
[01:33:18.047 --> 01:33:20.448]  Because if it has validity, it will be shown to be so.
[01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:25.069]  I see you keep getting a few mentions on the Tucker Carlson Show now.
[01:33:27.009 --> 01:33:29.730]  It's no secret that we've woken up Tucker Carlson, and that's great.
[01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:31.190]  And again, it's not about us, as you said.
[01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:33.611]  All I'm saying is you really got hit.
[01:33:34.111 --> 01:33:35.931]  People laughing at you on the street, same thing.
[01:33:36.211 --> 01:33:41.432]  And now they're not laughing anymore because they realize, and again, that's just, we have to recognize trailblazing.
[01:33:41.492 --> 01:33:43.373]  It's been done, and thanks to our supporters,
[01:33:43.973 --> 01:33:48.415]  They have been just as important as we have, keeping us out there, keeping us on air.
[01:33:48.435 --> 01:33:50.956]  But now with the censorship, the support is more important than ever.
[01:33:51.257 --> 01:33:52.797]  David, I can't wait to read your new book.
[01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:54.738]  Read your last one, and I read your first one.
[01:33:54.778 --> 01:33:55.338]  Help wake me up.
[01:33:55.378 --> 01:33:56.159]  Thank you so much, David.
[01:33:57.318 --> 01:33:57.799]  No problem, mate.
[01:33:57.879 --> 01:33:59.160]  It's been a real pleasure, as always.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.041]  Thank you so much.
[01:34:00.441 --> 01:34:03.785]  All right, folks, that's David Icke in a truly iconic interview.
[01:34:03.965 --> 01:34:05.707]  We'll post this whole thing at Banned.Video.

[01:34:32.453 --> 01:34:34.014]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[01:34:34.774 --> 01:34:38.256]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.

[01:35:18.114 --> 01:35:22.996]  And again, I want to thank you all for joining us on this marathon, commercial free.
[01:35:24.938 --> 01:35:26.539]  Saturday Transmission by Commercial Free.
[01:35:26.559 --> 01:35:29.362]  We're not running the radio TV ads that we would normally run.
[01:35:29.382 --> 01:35:31.843]  We are just here doing long form interviews.
[01:35:31.883 --> 01:35:36.147]  You just saw an hour and a half interview unedited with David Icke.
[01:35:36.987 --> 01:35:41.111]  Then we have a bunch of other special guests joining us coming up in a little while that I already told you about.
[01:35:41.451 --> 01:35:43.392]  But I wanted to get Robert Barnes on because
[01:35:44.457 --> 01:35:45.758]  I had him on Thursday.
[01:35:46.258 --> 01:35:47.839]  He did work for Trump on the campaign.
[01:35:47.879 --> 01:35:49.859]  He did work on the whole election fraud situation.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.261]  And we got cut short just by the fact that it was the end of the show.
[01:35:53.721 --> 01:36:01.505]  Getting into what's really going on with election fraud or voter fraud versus red herrings from his expert, very well informed, very well immersed.
[01:36:02.571 --> 01:36:30.242]  Position so I want to get to that with him in the 30 minutes or so we have of Again tape to air live feed where he has a chance to not be interrupted But first what about the incredible numbers that have been developing for a month out of Israel out of Australia that really ripened now Israel's Numbers and Australia's numbers report 95 to 99 percent of the hospitalized have been fully vaccinated
[01:36:31.095 --> 01:36:37.962]  Even though if you look at Australia, they're only 27% inoculated, but 99 plus percent actually there.
[01:36:38.283 --> 01:36:44.629]  They only have one person in the hospital in Australia who's not been injected by one of these Franken shots.
[01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:47.973]  We see similar numbers out of Gibraltar, similar numbers out of
[01:36:49.449 --> 01:36:50.129]  I don't think so.
[01:37:10.805 --> 01:37:13.987]  Antibody dependency syndrome, all sorts of things.
[01:37:14.347 --> 01:37:15.548]  I know you've got your ear to the ground.
[01:37:15.608 --> 01:37:19.310]  What do you make of these numbers that are really now solidified and documented?
[01:37:19.551 --> 01:37:23.853]  And even healthcare high-level practitioners are saying this is quite a phenomenon.
[01:37:23.873 --> 01:37:24.734]  They don't know what to make out of it.
[01:37:26.058 --> 01:37:37.084]  Well, just look at the information that came out on Friday from Alex Berenson, who's been banned from Twitter, longtime New York Times journalist and writer historically, because of what he's been putting out.
[01:37:37.164 --> 01:37:44.188]  And all he's been pointing out is tracking Israel's data, tracking the United Kingdom's data, tracking what's happening in Iceland and Gibraltar.
[01:37:44.648 --> 01:37:57.582]  And what we find is the most vaccinated countries in the world are experiencing spikes so bad that all Iceland, Gibraltar, and Israel, the three countries with the highest vaccination rate in the world, are all talking about locking down again.
[01:37:58.594 --> 01:38:02.135]  So then you look at what Alex Berenson's data is also talking about.
[01:38:02.256 --> 01:38:17.081]  An internal report leaked from Moderna which showed that their internal documents show that the number of serious adverse events being reported is three times higher what's in the VAERS data for their vaccine.
[01:38:17.583 --> 01:38:21.208]  Then you put on top of that the final Pfizer report that came out.
[01:38:21.809 --> 01:38:32.465]  And for some reason, the sole report being used for Pfizer to be able to get FDA full authorization for their vaccine, the primary vaccine in the Western world,
[01:38:32.985 --> 01:38:40.031]  They failed to even look at any hospitalization difference between those who got the placebo and those who got the vaccine.
[01:38:40.471 --> 01:38:49.259]  And their own final data confirms that, in fact, more people died that got the vaccine during their time period than who died from COVID.
[01:38:49.839 --> 01:38:52.720]  And so it raises serious questions about what's going on.
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.880]  And this goes back to that.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:39:02.142]  You look at whether you're talking about Dr. Malone, whether you're talking about Dr. Greek, I'm not going to try to pronounce his last name, but that was even a Gates guy.
[01:39:02.162 --> 01:39:04.482]  That's one of the biggest pro-vaccine people in the world.
[01:39:04.862 --> 01:39:10.844]  And he went on six months ago with Brett Weinstein and said, don't do a vaccine in the middle of the pandemic.
[01:39:11.164 --> 01:39:11.484]  Why?
[01:39:11.844 --> 01:39:16.745]  Because it's likely to create variants that will be more lethal.
[01:39:17.225 --> 01:39:23.028]  Because that's the nature of these viruses in response to a mass vaccination campaign during a pandemic.
[01:39:23.428 --> 01:39:26.810]  And it looks like what he predicted is starting to come true.
[01:39:28.431 --> 01:39:34.154]  And again, all the BS numbers from weeks ago about the unvaccinated or the ones spreading it, those have all been proven to be false headlines.
[01:39:34.795 --> 01:39:39.197]  Now, all over the world, we know that it has been those that have been injected that are 95 to 99.9% of those.
[01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:40.678]  They're trying to spin it as a variant.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:55.928]  Listen, I'm not a scientist, I'm not a virologist or epidemiologist, but the vast majority of prominent, respected ones, EDOM, the former head of Pfizer, all of them said, this is going to cause deadly variants.
[01:39:55.948 --> 01:39:57.950]  This is going to cause autoimmune responses.
[01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:59.971]  This is going to cause the body to attack itself.
[01:39:59.991 --> 01:40:01.192]  This is going to cause heart attacks.
[01:40:01.532 --> 01:40:02.573]  This is going to cause strokes.
[01:40:02.593 --> 01:40:06.176]  And because so many of them said it, I said, okay, looks like this is going to happen.
[01:40:06.576 --> 01:40:08.057]  But this isn't a year ago, Robert.
[01:40:08.277 --> 01:40:13.659]  We're now here, it's happening, and the system's doubling down saying boosters are the answer.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:15.900]  So it really looks very premeditated to me.
[01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:20.462]  Why would you launch something so reckless, so crazy, and then only double down on it?
[01:40:21.583 --> 01:40:30.467]  Because I think the goal is to say that it works for a couple of months and is to force you to get shots for the rest of your life from big pharma that's government subsidized.
[01:40:30.527 --> 01:40:32.808]  Precisely, and that's what Gates said a year and a half ago.
[01:40:32.828 --> 01:40:34.088]  He goes, oh, you'll need boosters.
[01:40:34.148 --> 01:40:35.249]  So they knew this wouldn't work.
[01:40:36.658 --> 01:40:37.018]  Precisely.
[01:40:37.038 --> 01:40:50.387]  Well, that's because, as you've been documenting for a year, as all of these prominent scientists and doctors and virologists and epidemiologists and others have been saying, there's never been a successful vaccine against coronavirus in our history, in world history.
[01:40:50.667 --> 01:41:01.194]  We've been trying to get a vaccine against something like this, coronavirus or influenza or bird flu or H1N1 or any of them, swine flu, and they've all failed.
[01:41:01.254 --> 01:41:05.997]  We've never got a highly successful, we can't even get a highly successful flu shot year in, year out.
[01:41:06.377 --> 01:41:16.406]  So how in the world are we going to get a successful coronavirus vaccine when one of the big problems was that they created worse side effects than they could solve problems?
[01:41:16.706 --> 01:41:19.749]  That's been the history of it going back just last 10 years.
[01:41:20.169 --> 01:41:24.513]  So what we're seeing is the exact consequence of what people like Bill Gates knew were coming.
[01:41:24.973 --> 01:41:39.439]  But it still fits into their ultimate agenda to condition people to politically, culturally and legally accept an implant in your body at the subject and control of your employer and big pharma and big government for the rest of your life.
[01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:45.541]  That's the goal and that's the only logical explanation for what appears to be a complete failure as a public policy.
[01:41:45.781 --> 01:41:50.603]  And then we actually read what the head UK scientist working through Pfizer
[01:41:51.696 --> 01:41:52.217]  We're good to go.
[01:42:15.273 --> 01:42:22.501]  And the genius is by relabeling it vaccine, they're no longer liable for anything that goes wrong with the vaccine.
[01:42:22.961 --> 01:42:24.343]  All the doctors are off the hook.
[01:42:24.683 --> 01:42:26.145]  All the hospitals are off the hook.
[01:42:26.485 --> 01:42:28.668]  All the insurance companies are mostly off the hook.
[01:42:29.048 --> 01:42:30.510]  All the employers are off the hook.
[01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:34.334]  And most importantly, all of government and big pharma is off the hook.
[01:42:34.794 --> 01:42:46.526]  So by relabeling it vaccine, conditioning people to accept it for the failure is almost built in, kind of like Obamacare, where the goal is for the system to fail to justify a more radical expansion of state power.
[01:42:46.947 --> 01:42:49.229]  And here this is almost designed to fail.
[01:42:49.610 --> 01:42:51.331]  It was very predictable that it would fail.
[01:42:51.371 --> 01:42:55.776]  Again, big vaccine advocates have been predicting for six plus months that this would fail.
[01:42:55.776 --> 01:42:58.722]  Because it's designed to fail because it's a problem they can never fix.
[01:42:59.142 --> 01:43:06.096]  And instead of just infecting us with a bacteria or virus that we can actually create drugs and vaccines to stop, they do it where it creates a protein
[01:43:07.062 --> 01:43:12.363]  Colonization that then the system controls and that protein slowly kills us.
[01:43:12.403 --> 01:43:15.024]  So this is the final depopulation weapon.
[01:43:15.564 --> 01:43:26.247]  They've released a plague, kind of like in the movie Interstellar, that somehow either it's man-made, they're not sure, some type of dust is forming, a mold is forming that takes over the atmosphere and kills everything.
[01:43:26.647 --> 01:43:33.109]  They have introduced something into us now with prion crystals through the vaccine that they knew in all other studies did that to the rats.
[01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:38.833]  And they've now put it into billions of people, meaning it's growing all over the place inside our bodies.
[01:43:39.193 --> 01:43:40.594]  This is not a science fiction movie.
[01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:46.499]  This is the real world in, it's hard to believe, August 2021.
[01:43:47.399 --> 01:43:54.705]  Barnes, I want to finish up with this and I want to get into the election and where all that's going, but I've used the allegory of
[01:43:56.007 --> 01:43:59.228]  Or the analogy or the parallel of Deepwater Horizon.
[01:43:59.248 --> 01:44:00.889]  And I know you followed that.
[01:44:00.929 --> 01:44:01.389]  You're a lawyer.
[01:44:01.409 --> 01:44:02.189]  You follow the court case.
[01:44:02.249 --> 01:44:02.969]  I watched the film.
[01:44:03.029 --> 01:44:04.050]  I watched the documentary about it.
[01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:07.611]  The film is basically a transcript, as you know, of what was reported in the trial.
[01:44:08.311 --> 01:44:14.593]  But here are the engineers in London, England and Houston, Texas, ordering this super deep well, the deepest in the world at the time.
[01:44:15.492 --> 01:44:20.861]  To keep drilling but not to dump concrete they call mud on top to pressurize so that it wouldn't blow out.
[01:44:20.961 --> 01:44:25.409]  And the engineer said, if you don't do this, it will blow up the rig.
[01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:26.871]  Now that's just a fact.
[01:44:28.018 --> 01:44:35.304]  And they said, we are a 40-something billion dollar company, that's a quote, that's in the film, it's in the trial, we suspend mathematics.
[01:44:35.324 --> 01:44:46.092]  And I don't know if they were on cocaine or what they were taking, and London gave the order to Houston, and they gave the order and they sent an executive out to do it, thinking engineers have just made this up when it's mathematics, science.
[01:44:46.973 --> 01:44:47.734]  So it's the same thing.
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:52.783]  Then it blew up and caused, you know, trillion dollars in damages or whatever.
[01:44:53.443 --> 01:44:56.205]  My point is, were they doing that actually on purpose for some reason?
[01:44:56.605 --> 01:44:57.966]  Or are they that crazy?
[01:44:58.006 --> 01:45:07.953]  Because the crime they've committed doing this and launching this attack and doing this to everyone, it is so reckless and so wild.
[01:45:07.973 --> 01:45:12.776]  When all the science said it would do this kind of like, if you don't put concrete in the hole, it will blow up.
[01:45:13.176 --> 01:45:18.520]  If you give people a so-called vaccine that attacks a protein in the body, you're going to kill billions of people.
[01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:20.641]  And now it's happening.
[01:45:20.661 --> 01:45:24.162]  It's not just hypothetical on a chalkboard now or on a computer screen.
[01:45:24.462 --> 01:45:28.624]  So just the mindset of that, and a lot of people tell me, I don't care why a killer does it, Alex.
[01:45:29.104 --> 01:45:36.226]  You know, you shouldn't do the navel-gazing of wondering, and I get that, but knowing why the elites are doing it is how we stop them.
[01:45:36.266 --> 01:45:37.087]  I think it's very important.
[01:45:37.127 --> 01:45:40.028]  Why do you think they're doing things that are equivalent of Deepwater Horizon 2.0?
[01:45:41.696 --> 01:45:43.097]  Because it's about total control.
[01:45:43.177 --> 01:45:45.498]  It's finding the pretext for total control.
[01:45:45.558 --> 01:45:51.541]  Control of the human being, control of the human body, and by the state and Big Pharma and by other elites.
[01:45:52.001 --> 01:46:03.187]  And my view is what's coming is just like what you did at the very beginning, which was to track Bill Gates' patent request, and that that would give you a forecast of everything that was forthcoming.
[01:46:03.747 --> 01:46:13.574]  And one of his patent requests was a quantum tattoo that could actually release, say, chemicals in your body, was one of the things he was trying to patent.
[01:46:13.995 --> 01:46:21.000]  Also, a chip in your body, a quantum tattoo as it was popularly called, that he was trying to develop, that would also control currency.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.981]  That would also control your identity.
[01:46:23.101 --> 01:46:28.563]  And he was comparing it to the Indian government experiment that he was also integral as a part of.
[01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:29.884]  So I think that's the goal.
[01:46:30.164 --> 01:46:32.805]  The goal is to say, you know what, we really need to know what's in your body.
[01:46:33.125 --> 01:46:34.786]  We need to have identification.
[01:46:34.826 --> 01:46:42.829]  Remember, Gates was the first one talking about having some form of quantum tattoo or other genetic identification card related to a COVID vaccine.
[01:46:43.509 --> 01:46:46.451]  So, I think the goal is, what's the pretext?
[01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:58.776]  How can you convince the entire world to let Bill Gates stick a chip in you that can govern where you travel, what your identification is, what goes into your body, and whether or not you can spend money for food or rent?
[01:46:59.237 --> 01:46:59.717]  This is how.
[01:47:02.512 --> 01:47:04.133]  It's just total madness.
[01:47:04.173 --> 01:47:11.755]  You read about Hitler, you read about Stalin, you read about Lenin, you read about Mao, and they're like, why would Mao make half the country go off their farms knowing it was starving to death?
[01:47:11.775 --> 01:47:12.675]  Because he wanted control.
[01:47:13.435 --> 01:47:16.016]  He didn't want them out there being independent, even though they were, like, worshipping him.
[01:47:16.636 --> 01:47:19.577]  And it's just raw, psychotic execution of power.
[01:47:19.837 --> 01:47:21.398]  How do you counter something like that?
[01:47:23.018 --> 01:47:24.399]  By appealing to the human conscience.
[01:47:24.679 --> 01:47:37.328]  You know, like some of the old great founders of various human groups throughout history, pro-human groups throughout history, is that all the corrupt institutions could never shut down the archives of nature or the rights of man.
[01:47:37.688 --> 01:47:47.635]  That as long as you can look to the world and use the faculty of reason and listen to your own soul, then you can push back against any false narrative from institutional powers that wish to corrupt the truth.
[01:47:48.155 --> 01:47:54.498]  And it's the power of the people to listen to the sort of God's fingerprints on our souls and on the world around us.
[01:47:54.798 --> 01:47:56.879]  We all we have to do is employ it and utilize it.
[01:47:57.119 --> 01:47:58.820]  And that's always been the way to fight back.
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:00.801]  That's why they're so obsessed with censorship.
[01:48:01.021 --> 01:48:02.601]  That's why they're so obsessed with control.
[01:48:02.882 --> 01:48:12.906]  That's why they're so obsessed with defaming anybody who questions or contests the institutional narrative, even if they're prize winning doctors and scientists, even if they're from the left, like Bobby Kennedy and Brett Weinstein.
[01:48:13.346 --> 01:48:15.327]  That's right and what you're saying is very important.
[01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:30.513]  They did this as a big bold move, as an exercise to see, can we suppress it?
[01:48:30.913 --> 01:48:31.734]  Can we hide it?
[01:48:31.814 --> 01:48:32.675]  Can we censor?
[01:48:33.095 --> 01:48:34.516]  Can we get away with this?
[01:48:34.596 --> 01:48:36.998]  It's like giving everybody autism, they got away with that.
[01:48:37.058 --> 01:48:38.920]  Or Tuskegee, they thought they got away with that.
[01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:42.422]  It's all an exercise, a test to see what they can get away with.
[01:48:42.523 --> 01:48:42.843]  Okay.
[01:48:43.283 --> 01:48:45.545]  All right, Barnes, let's shift gears now into the big issue.
[01:48:45.985 --> 01:48:51.730]  I really like Mike Lindell, and I think he means well, and I had him on the show Friday.
[01:48:53.103 --> 01:48:59.548]  And I said to him, I said, listen, I get people can hack into machines and I get, you can say you've got a download of all the machines or whatever.
[01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:05.633]  But I said, just going after the signatures not being looked at and the ballots being double counted, that's all confirmed.
[01:49:06.334 --> 01:49:11.498]  And all these laws not being passed to say, you know, hey, one person did this.
[01:49:11.818 --> 01:49:12.879]  Well, how are you going to prove that?
[01:49:13.399 --> 01:49:17.683]  Instead of showing the problems of the system, getting laws passed, moving forward,
[01:49:18.603 --> 01:49:24.348]  But I understand, like they boldly said, Biden said, no matter what happens with Trump, Pelosi said, we're going to be in there.
[01:49:24.388 --> 01:49:25.469]  They said, look for the red mirage.
[01:49:25.509 --> 01:49:26.150]  We're going to take it.
[01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:27.771]  So clearly they just took it.
[01:49:28.872 --> 01:49:32.875]  So I like how he's positive and I'm looking forward to this symposium.
[01:49:33.476 --> 01:49:34.257]  I'm going to go to the symposium.
[01:49:34.277 --> 01:49:35.217]  I'm going to send crew to it.
[01:49:36.378 --> 01:49:38.540]  But I know you worked for Trump.
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:41.062]  You worked on the election fraud issue.
[01:49:41.082 --> 01:49:42.103]  You saw the real numbers.
[01:49:42.423 --> 01:49:44.745]  And what you saw, I saw later, more now.
[01:49:44.805 --> 01:49:46.407]  And so I told Lindell, I said, listen,
[01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:49.322]  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
[01:49:49.362 --> 01:49:51.423]  People are really following you and listening to you, and you're a good guy.
[01:49:52.263 --> 01:49:53.444]  Make it about the midterms.
[01:49:53.484 --> 01:49:54.925]  Make it about a fraud in general.
[01:49:54.965 --> 01:50:02.489]  Make it about a giant investigation, not everything on one... And people should tune in to this symposium, the event, that's all good.
[01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:06.291]  Spend 15 minutes, and I know you got to go, 15-20 minutes.
[01:50:06.351 --> 01:50:06.951]  I'm trying to shut up.
[01:50:06.971 --> 01:50:07.412]  Give me the floor.
[01:50:08.251 --> 01:50:08.551]  Sure.
[01:50:08.571 --> 01:50:11.092]  So, to me, the core issues in the election were three things.
[01:50:11.132 --> 01:50:14.533]  Were there people who voted who were not constitutionally qualified to vote in the presidential election?
[01:50:31.119 --> 01:50:38.394]  Second, what were there people who cast ballots in a manner that was not a constitutionally qualified manner to cast ballots?
[01:50:38.991 --> 01:50:45.713]  And then third was the canvassing and the counting of the ballots done in a constitutionally consistent manner.
[01:50:46.093 --> 01:51:04.277]  And here for the presidential election, the Constitution requires that only the rules passed by the legislature of the state governments determines what is constitutionally qualified either to vote in the presidential election or to cast a vote or in terms of the counting and canvassing of the votes.
[01:51:04.777 --> 01:51:15.363]  And the question is, if there were constitutionally unqualified ballots included in the count, then what remedy was taken to see how many of those ballots existed?
[01:51:15.843 --> 01:51:18.305]  Were those ballots bigger than the margin of victory?
[01:51:19.025 --> 01:51:20.806]  And could remedy then be sought?
[01:51:21.406 --> 01:51:33.173]  Unfortunately, what happened during the litigation is those issues sort of got sidetracked and derailed by a combination of corrupt insiders who pretended to be working for the president, who in fact were not.
[01:51:33.897 --> 01:51:42.120]  And frankly sometimes some crazy outsiders who got attracted to an idea that was meant to be a red herring from the get-go.
[01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:53.363]  Because the more people talked about servers in Germany and ballots in China and computers made in Venezuela, they were not talking about people who weren't qualified to vote voting.
[01:51:53.723 --> 01:51:59.505]  They were not talking about votes being cast in a manner where the signatures did not match on the mail-in ballot.
[01:51:59.625 --> 01:52:03.427]  And again, I said you got the floor, but I'm sorry, that general is totally senile.
[01:52:03.787 --> 01:52:07.990]  And he's like, we got the Kraken document, it's coming out, and then all this real stuff gets ignored.
[01:52:09.231 --> 01:52:09.631]  Exactly.
[01:52:09.651 --> 01:52:10.792]  And that was the goal from the get-go.
[01:52:11.232 --> 01:52:13.413]  We were on the ground in Georgia.
[01:52:13.433 --> 01:52:15.895]  I mean, Patrick Witt is now running for Congress in Georgia.
[01:52:15.935 --> 01:52:16.775]  He was there with me.
[01:52:17.055 --> 01:52:22.459]  Took time off from the White House to come down and volunteer his own time, going door-to-door.
[01:52:22.499 --> 01:52:24.900]  We were spotting issues with how they were doing the count.
[01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:27.844]  Yeah, for those that don't know, I should have said up front, you were sent by the White House.
[01:52:27.904 --> 01:52:28.885]  I was there in Georgia with you.
[01:52:29.146 --> 01:52:32.210]  You didn't want it on record at the time, but you were telling me everything that was about to unfold.
[01:52:32.531 --> 01:52:33.772]  I mean, you were actually sent by Trump.
[01:52:33.792 --> 01:52:35.555]  I should say up front, you were sent by Trump.
[01:52:35.615 --> 01:52:37.938]  So this is actually a real Trump lawyer right now.
[01:52:37.958 --> 01:52:42.024]  This isn't somebody claiming about secret servers and Krakens and all the rest of it.
[01:52:43.035 --> 01:52:43.496]  No, that's right.
[01:52:43.516 --> 01:52:46.640]  The president called me on the phone personally and asked me to go down there.
[01:52:47.081 --> 01:52:49.804]  And I told him that the key issue would be signature match checks.
[01:52:49.844 --> 01:52:54.290]  And if they would allow a signature match audit to occur, then they think the vote's on the up and up.
[01:52:54.491 --> 01:52:57.475]  If they wouldn't, then they knew the vote was not on the up and up.
[01:52:57.555 --> 01:52:59.638]  And the only question was matters of proof and remedy.
[01:53:00.078 --> 01:53:06.083]  And in fact, no city, no county, no state allowed any signature match check to occur anywhere.
[01:53:06.403 --> 01:53:11.126]  It's only these audits going on now that are finally getting to take a little bit of a peek at it.
[01:53:11.506 --> 01:53:19.012]  And the Maricopa County supervisors are currently trying to hide that information and refusing again to respond to a subpoena.
[01:53:19.252 --> 01:53:20.913]  So there's a lot of good work going on.
[01:53:21.234 --> 01:53:27.218]  What was always a distraction, what was always a red herring, the greater the crime, the bigger the patsy.
[01:53:27.578 --> 01:53:38.515]  The Lee Harvey Oswald of this set of events was always to look at computers and servers and foreign activity because that's not where the evidence ever went.
[01:53:38.575 --> 01:53:39.216]  And explain that.
[01:53:39.296 --> 01:53:41.219]  To kill a story, you create a new story.
[01:53:42.316 --> 01:53:42.797]  Exactly.
[01:53:43.137 --> 01:53:46.240]  If you're going to kill President Kennedy, you need a Patsy.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.782]  Otherwise, people are going to be enraged at what happened.
[01:53:48.882 --> 01:53:51.284]  If you kill Bobby Kennedy, you need a Patsy.
[01:53:51.664 --> 01:53:54.327]  If you kill Dr. Martin Luther King, you need a Patsy.
[01:53:54.627 --> 01:53:58.210]  And if you're going to steal an election, by golly, you sure as heck need a Patsy.
[01:53:58.710 --> 01:54:09.838]  And so the goal was always to set up a Patsy that would be the most difficult to prove, that would be seeded with false narratives and false stories by informants and infiltrators, that were up to no good.
[01:54:10.258 --> 01:54:13.520]  I mean, you got this Code Monkey guy, that guy's totally unreliable.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:17.823]  He's connected to QAnon, he's- Well, I was about to say, it's always the 8-chan.
[01:54:18.463 --> 01:54:22.626]  People ran up to me a few days ago, look, oh, we got the proof about Dominion, and I said, that's frickin' 8-chan, man!
[01:54:23.126 --> 01:54:25.408]  They have been the ones that have set us up every time.
[01:54:26.681 --> 01:54:27.081]  Exactly!
[01:54:27.101 --> 01:54:35.565]  They're the people who set folks up on January 6th, and they set up a lot of people close to Trump after the election to derail the credibility of the election.
[01:54:35.625 --> 01:54:40.347]  They did the Sandy Hook thing, they did the Pizzagate, all of it to distract from real stuff.
[01:54:40.387 --> 01:54:45.849]  And I'm sorry, doesn't mean everybody on 8chan's bad, but my God, I mean, I've told my crew, just stay away from it like the plague.
[01:54:47.202 --> 01:54:47.582]  Completely!
[01:54:47.642 --> 01:54:49.924]  I mean, they deliberately seed misinformation.
[01:54:49.964 --> 01:54:59.532]  I've dealt with it for a long time in political movements across the left and the right, where somebody has a core right idea about something, and then somebody plants a crazy idea.
[01:54:59.632 --> 01:55:16.685]  Oh yeah, we have WikiLeaks with Podesta in a hot tub with kids with Aleister Crowley talk, confirmed emails about doing Crowley rituals and stuff, and then suddenly, oh there's a pizza place, they're in there, they're killing them in the bottom, and then the CNN reports it, we cover it, and then they claim I put it out.
[01:55:17.205 --> 01:55:18.027]  Total setup.
[01:55:18.408 --> 01:55:19.431]  Total way to distract us.
[01:55:19.451 --> 01:55:23.723]  How do you distract from, oh my god, WikiLeaks released the holy grail of Satanism.
[01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:25.848]  Now no one even cares about all that.
[01:55:27.219 --> 01:55:27.719]  Precisely.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:28.900]  You need a straw man.
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:29.881]  You need a distraction.
[01:55:30.181 --> 01:55:31.222]  You need a red herring.
[01:55:31.702 --> 01:55:34.184]  And that's precisely what all of this other stuff is.
[01:55:34.604 --> 01:55:40.028]  And I think a lot of well-meaning people have taken the bait and they've jumped down that rabbit hole.
[01:55:40.548 --> 01:55:42.769]  And so they have information that doesn't hold up.
[01:55:43.090 --> 01:55:45.071]  They have information that they'll never be able to prove.
[01:55:45.111 --> 01:55:45.751]  So let me ask this.
[01:55:45.811 --> 01:55:49.214]  What's the real state of stopping the Democrats from stealing 2022?
[01:55:49.594 --> 01:55:55.118]  We know they want to start an endless lockdown basically next week that's going to run through next year so they can do mail-in ballots again.
[01:55:55.458 --> 01:55:56.539]  What's the real lay of the land?
[01:55:56.579 --> 01:55:57.099]  How do we stop it?
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:55:58.761]  Two things.
[01:55:58.941 --> 01:56:00.964]  One, election law reforms everywhere.
[01:56:01.264 --> 01:56:05.849]  There's good election law reforms that have either already passed or that are in the process of being passed.
[01:56:05.969 --> 01:56:07.091]  That's a critical first step.
[01:56:07.491 --> 01:56:08.973]  And second is public involvement.
[01:56:09.273 --> 01:56:13.859]  There's nothing that stops anybody from going and being an election observer at a precinct.
[01:56:14.479 --> 01:56:18.021]  At going on and being on an election board or election commission in their local town.
[01:56:18.382 --> 01:56:20.323]  Remember, elections are always local.
[01:56:20.363 --> 01:56:22.104]  This includes your real small towns.
[01:56:22.404 --> 01:56:25.686]  Precincts usually have maybe a couple hundred people who ever vote there.
[01:56:26.407 --> 01:56:29.288]  But if they're going to try to rig an election, they're going to try to rig it everywhere.
[01:56:29.608 --> 01:56:32.150]  You can be part of the process that observes elections.
[01:56:32.410 --> 01:56:35.272]  Be part of the process like the great Arizona audit has been.
[01:56:35.652 --> 01:56:39.514]  Let's have more transparency, more openness, more involvement, more observation.
[01:56:39.915 --> 01:56:43.477]  And that amount of sunlight is what's going to prevent them from doing
[01:56:43.798 --> 01:56:44.382]  What they did in 2020.
[01:56:45.615 --> 01:56:55.521]  Instead, if we bet everything on one number, because obviously there's machine problems and real issues, and a lot of it's gonna be true, but if we let everything on one number, they're gonna try to go, oh, see, that was all done there.
[01:56:56.001 --> 01:56:56.981]  That was discredited.
[01:56:57.502 --> 01:57:01.424]  And so I know Lindell's listening to me somewhat, and I know he watches these shows and gets feedback.
[01:57:02.865 --> 01:57:04.005]  What would you warn Lindell?
[01:57:04.026 --> 01:57:05.046]  I think he has a very good heart.
[01:57:05.066 --> 01:57:05.867]  He has a lot of courage.
[01:57:05.947 --> 01:57:06.787]  I really love the guy.
[01:57:06.807 --> 01:57:09.228]  And I'm not saying he's bad having the Cyber Symposium.
[01:57:09.509 --> 01:57:10.529]  I'm overall supporting him.
[01:57:11.150 --> 01:57:15.192]  I just see somebody betting everything on one number, and I don't have a good feeling.
[01:57:16.423 --> 01:57:16.823]  Exactly.
[01:57:16.943 --> 01:57:17.983]  I would say diversify.
[01:57:18.323 --> 01:57:22.504]  Continue to look at all of the issues and make sure to highlight all of the concerns.
[01:57:22.865 --> 01:57:24.245]  Don't get stuck on one issue.
[01:57:24.625 --> 01:57:28.986]  Look at were people registered to vote who are living in parking lots or mailboxes?
[01:57:29.726 --> 01:57:32.447]  Or weren't even 18 or were felons and couldn't vote?
[01:57:32.867 --> 01:57:34.807]  Were people voting from prisons and jails?
[01:57:35.168 --> 01:57:37.068]  Because there was evidence that that may have occurred.
[01:57:37.428 --> 01:57:38.688]  Were there dead people who voted?
[01:57:38.708 --> 01:57:40.589]  There may be evidence where that occurred.
[01:57:40.929 --> 01:57:42.709]  Look at whether the way they cast the ballots.
[01:57:42.749 --> 01:57:45.030]  We should have one signature match standard for everybody.
[01:57:45.430 --> 01:57:50.438]  Well, I mean, look at this covering up the windows when they're counting in the middle of the night when Biden suddenly wins.
[01:57:50.758 --> 01:57:52.060]  That's the proof right there!
[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:53.061]  My God, look at that!
[01:57:53.963 --> 01:57:57.929]  That's why 80-some percent of Republicans think they stole it, and almost 40 percent of Democrats.
[01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:59.231]  I mean, look at that crap!
[01:58:00.702 --> 01:58:17.213]  All people have to do is compare the signature match standards that the courts and the Democrats applied to Kanye's petitions in 2020 to get on the ballot, places like Virginia and Illinois where he was denied, versus the signature match standards they did not want applied to actual mail-in ballots.
[01:58:17.573 --> 01:58:21.216]  We should have the same standards, at least from the same election for the same office.
[01:58:21.656 --> 01:58:24.538]  That was always the big issue that would have killed them.
[01:58:24.898 --> 01:58:27.860]  It needs to continue to be highlighted, continue to be exposed.
[01:58:28.200 --> 01:58:34.605]  People have a right to request that information through things like the Open Records Act in Georgia, various Sunshine Laws across the country.
[01:58:34.665 --> 01:58:35.986]  Get your local city's records.
[01:58:36.226 --> 01:58:37.547]  Get your local county's records.
[01:58:37.767 --> 01:58:38.687]  Compare it yourself.
[01:58:39.908 --> 01:58:42.530]  Crowdsource the truth and get it out to everybody.
[01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:51.476]  That's where people like Mike Lindell could help by focusing on these big issues that get buried when these red herrings become highlighted too much.
[01:58:54.237 --> 01:59:06.560]  What do you expect to unfold with A, the servers and the machines, which we know all the big companies have problems, major scams, hackers, private groups, people getting involved, political parties using backdoors.
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:10.140]  No one's denying that these machines aren't designed with backdoors and Swiss cheese.
[01:59:10.561 --> 01:59:12.041]  I've been on that for 27 years.
[01:59:12.081 --> 01:59:12.981]  I know you have as well.
[01:59:14.161 --> 01:59:18.102]  We're the same age and you've been a political lawyer and involved since I've been on air.
[01:59:18.563 --> 01:59:19.983]  So our track kind of follows.
[01:59:20.856 --> 01:59:31.642]  But again, using names of dead people, that's a Democrat favorite, voting the names of dead people, harvesting names of folks they know have moved out of state, and then letting people vote in those names.
[01:59:31.662 --> 01:59:34.643]  I mean, we know that's, we've caught them red-handed.
[01:59:34.683 --> 01:59:38.365]  What do you expect to come out of Arizona and to come out of these other audits that are starting?
[01:59:38.385 --> 01:59:40.686]  Because it certainly got the Attorney General scared.
[01:59:40.726 --> 01:59:43.768]  He's trying to intimidate folks right now and saying these states need to stop.
[01:59:43.788 --> 01:59:45.449]  So I see that as a really good sign that they're concerned.
[01:59:46.536 --> 01:59:47.097]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:59:47.157 --> 01:59:55.864]  I think the Wisconsin Senate appointing a special counsel was great to find out whether all these indefinitely confined people were actually indefinitely confined under the legal standard.
[01:59:56.785 --> 01:59:59.287]  The Pennsylvania talking about doing an audit is good.
[01:59:59.587 --> 02:00:02.309]  What they're exposing about Fulton County in Georgia is very good.
[02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:04.351]  And I think in the Arizona audit,
[02:00:04.971 --> 02:00:11.018]  If they're subpoenaing the right information, they should fight for all the information and critically do a signature match check.
[02:00:11.038 --> 02:00:23.793]  They've already apparently documented that they gave out different size ballot paper between if you voted early versus whether you voted on election day, even though they knew Trump's voters were overwhelmingly coming in on election day, which
[02:00:24.233 --> 02:00:28.557]  By the way, it might have been a mistake by Trump, tactically, but that's another story.
[02:00:29.237 --> 02:00:37.724]  So, Sharpiegate may turn out to be real because, contrary to what they originally said, they didn't give out real thick paper like they were supposed to on Election Day.
[02:00:37.944 --> 02:00:41.187]  It was unusually thin paper that did, in fact, cause bleed through.
[02:00:41.567 --> 02:00:53.697]  I think things like that, things like discrepancies in numbers, because one of the issues with these ballots is that there's a loss of ballot custody when you have electronic machines involved because they print their own ballots.
[02:00:54.037 --> 02:00:55.178]  They print test ballots.
[02:00:55.238 --> 02:00:57.581]  Remember what happened in the mayor's race in New York City?
[02:00:58.001 --> 02:01:01.404]  They accidentally had a whole bunch of test ballots counted as real ballots.
[02:01:01.805 --> 02:01:04.287]  So the way you can track that is look at serial numbers.
[02:01:04.327 --> 02:01:05.709]  See if the serial numbers make sense.
[02:01:06.049 --> 02:01:08.972]  So I think there's a bunch of intel and information that will come out.
[02:01:09.452 --> 02:01:11.314]  Also, I think it's great for education.
[02:01:11.694 --> 02:01:14.117]  People are learning how our elections really work.
[02:01:14.437 --> 02:01:16.079]  Honestly, probably for the first time ever.
[02:01:16.579 --> 02:01:19.645]  And we're seeing the highest engagement in modern history.
[02:01:19.665 --> 02:01:23.912]  In fact, they don't have numbers past 120 years ago, as you know, but they have rough numbers.
[02:01:23.932 --> 02:01:26.737]  But they believe this last turnout was probably the biggest in U.S.
[02:01:26.757 --> 02:01:27.018]  history.
[02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:28.641]  Absolutely.
[02:01:28.881 --> 02:01:36.309]  Well, remember right there in Texas, when LBJ won that Senate race, he said he wouldn't have even run and stayed in politics had he lost.
[02:01:36.810 --> 02:01:46.521]  And it took a historian, 30 years later, talking to the actual witnesses, because nobody else had, to find out that, in fact, it was an open secret that the election had been stolen.
[02:01:47.201 --> 02:01:51.723]  The head witness who testified for LBJ admitted, oh yeah, I was lying all along.
[02:01:52.063 --> 02:01:53.623]  So that information is out there.
[02:01:53.643 --> 02:01:57.725]  People know how the process works, know how to expose it, know how to highlight it.
[02:01:58.145 --> 02:02:00.206]  And so information is power.
[02:02:00.306 --> 02:02:03.367]  What InfoWars has always been about since its founding.
[02:02:03.687 --> 02:02:04.628]  Because it is power.
[02:02:04.688 --> 02:02:09.570]  If it wasn't power, Democrats wouldn't be squealing and screaming about the Arizona audit.
[02:02:09.610 --> 02:02:14.593]  The media wouldn't be running smear campaigns against it every other day, every other hour.
[02:02:14.913 --> 02:02:19.656]  It's because information is power and people should never underestimate their own power.
[02:02:20.036 --> 02:02:23.538]  Greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he did not exist.
[02:02:23.878 --> 02:02:28.101]  The greatest trick the system can pull is convincing you you cannot resist.
[02:02:28.461 --> 02:02:29.942]  What you do always matters.
[02:02:31.394 --> 02:02:33.695]  Well, certainly true words have never been spoken.
[02:02:33.775 --> 02:02:37.335]  So big picture in the time we have left with Robert Barnes on the special Saturday edition.
[02:02:37.355 --> 02:02:38.096]  I appreciate you joining us.
[02:02:38.116 --> 02:02:40.796]  I hope folks will share this link right now and also share the archive.
[02:02:40.836 --> 02:02:42.537]  That's how we reach new hearts and minds.
[02:02:44.197 --> 02:02:45.657]  The globalists are very unpopular.
[02:02:45.777 --> 02:02:52.159]  Even the main editor at Build, the biggest publication in Europe, out of Germany said, I apologize.
[02:02:52.179 --> 02:02:53.199]  We gave you fake numbers.
[02:02:53.219 --> 02:02:54.039]  We scared people.
[02:02:54.079 --> 02:02:55.060]  We got ordered to do it.
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:02:55.800]  I won't do it again.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:56.420]  I apologize.
[02:02:57.352 --> 02:03:01.416]  And we see a lot of other whistleblowers coming out, a lot of media people quitting and saying they won't be part of it.
[02:03:01.436 --> 02:03:03.719]  We see a lot of whistleblowers for the medical field.
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:14.691]  I just see the good, old-fashioned professionalism that's kind of a ghost that doctors forgot and nurses forgot and lawyers forgot.
[02:03:16.363 --> 02:03:22.808]  You know, journalists forgot, kind of coming back as people really see men, women, and children being beat up with billy clubs and run over by Clydesdales.
[02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:26.171]  And really, we don't have to have a violent revolution to stop this takeover.
[02:03:26.491 --> 02:03:31.995]  If people stop complying and going along with the official narratives, A, what's your take on that?
[02:03:32.075 --> 02:03:35.458]  And then B though, what are the sucker punches, the big left hooks?
[02:03:36.465 --> 02:03:39.047]  Or the deadly right jabs the globalists could pull.
[02:03:39.107 --> 02:03:41.188]  Is it a controlled power outage that they've been hyping?
[02:03:41.248 --> 02:03:42.769]  Is it a depression?
[02:03:43.130 --> 02:03:44.591]  Is it a big race war thing?
[02:03:44.631 --> 02:03:46.032]  Is it a mass shooting?
[02:03:46.072 --> 02:03:49.374]  Because this program is not being bought.
[02:03:50.655 --> 02:03:59.241]  They've launched it, they had the media, they had big tech to censor, but they had money to pay people off at first, but now folks realize the money's not worth anything because nobody's going to work.
[02:03:59.941 --> 02:04:07.645]  So, how do you think the establishment wargaming is seeing this period of time right now, and what's their sneaky move we should be watching?
[02:04:08.886 --> 02:04:13.649]  I think the key for the establishment right now is maintaining control.
[02:04:13.729 --> 02:04:15.370]  Same thing like in Cuba, for example.
[02:04:15.710 --> 02:04:21.573]  Cuba's obsession with maintaining control is maintaining the everyday police officer and everyday soldier.
[02:04:21.953 --> 02:04:26.096]  Because the reason why Batista's regime collapsed wasn't Fidel's success.
[02:04:26.836 --> 02:04:34.021]  It was rather that the average cop and average soldier quit believing in the system and quit enforcing bad laws.
[02:04:34.462 --> 02:04:42.507]  So the biggest threat to the system all along has been what happens when sheriffs step up and say, no, I'm not going to enforce an unconstitutional order.
[02:04:42.888 --> 02:04:52.935]  What happens when a local city or a local county passes a sanctuary law that says we're going to enforce the Constitution and not allow our local law enforcement to enforce unconstitutional rules or regulations?
[02:04:53.382 --> 02:04:55.464]  Well, what happens is the whole system collapses overnight.
[02:04:55.964 --> 02:05:04.652]  So the first wave is in the broader court of public opinion, but I think the system is obsessed with making sure there's no dissension amongst soldiers and cops.
[02:05:04.952 --> 02:05:12.018]  That's why there's this huge purge in the military going on to try to use under the pretext of whether somebody was a Trump supporter.
[02:05:12.518 --> 02:05:17.102]  Purging them out of the military because they need complete control of the ordinary soldier.
[02:05:17.383 --> 02:05:23.748]  But I can tell you right now, ordinary soldiers are looking at filing suit over the attempts to mandate the vaccine against them.
[02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:25.310]  So they're already pushing back.
[02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:27.852]  Sheriffs continue across the country to push back.
[02:05:27.952 --> 02:05:33.518]  And we've seen them join in France, and in Germany, and in England, and some here in the U.S.
[02:05:33.618 --> 02:05:35.400]  Very shameful in Australia.
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:43.468]  Aussies, I mean, are like the coolest people ever, and very independent, but I guess they've been a penal colony, so they have a law enforcement history of beating up kids.
[02:05:43.568 --> 02:05:46.691]  I mean, I've seen footage where they, like, beat up, like, 10-year-old girls.
[02:05:46.771 --> 02:05:48.833]  I mean, these people are bad.
[02:05:49.073 --> 02:05:50.295]  I mean, what the hell?
[02:05:51.423 --> 02:05:53.084]  And that's where publicly outing them is the key.
[02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:58.548]  At the end of the day, you as a police officer don't take an oath to a politician.
[02:05:58.829 --> 02:06:03.592]  You take an oath to the Constitution of the United States and your local government.
[02:06:03.632 --> 02:06:04.473]  And listen, I totally agree.
[02:06:04.513 --> 02:06:06.894]  Have you seen the Microsoft Bill Gates funded video game?
[02:06:07.195 --> 02:06:08.796]  I was on vacation so I didn't cover it properly.
[02:06:09.196 --> 02:06:14.020]  It's officially funded by Microsoft, put out, being distributed to 13 year olds on average.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:18.143]  We're in the US and in Taiwan and Hong Kong, US and Chinese troops together.
[02:06:18.843 --> 02:06:23.346]  Kill anyone protesting endless lockdowns, including children, and murder them.
[02:06:24.006 --> 02:06:26.968]  So this is a simulated combat killing game.
[02:06:27.688 --> 02:06:31.731]  A kill drill game to create instinctive shooting to train people to kill.
[02:06:31.751 --> 02:06:33.372]  That's what video games were invented for.
[02:06:34.212 --> 02:06:35.213]  Put out by Bill Gates.
[02:06:35.733 --> 02:06:36.194]  I mean, here he is.
[02:06:36.214 --> 02:06:38.075]  Yeah, Bill Gates' video game.
[02:06:38.115 --> 02:06:41.497]  He may murder a young girl who's dancing against the lockdown.
[02:06:42.357 --> 02:06:42.778]  And the U.S.
[02:06:42.798 --> 02:06:45.459]  military works with China to kill their own citizens.
[02:06:45.479 --> 02:06:48.201]  What do you make of this type of wet dream out of Bill Gates?
[02:06:49.209 --> 02:06:57.297]  Well, I think what Peter Thiel said a couple of years ago is true, which he said the greatest next risk from the system is going to be AI.
[02:06:57.897 --> 02:07:07.146]  And I think that there is a belief, there's not only an anti-human belief in terms of control that directs and governs a lot of these folks' mindsets,
[02:07:07.606 --> 02:07:11.811]  But I think there's a disbelief in continuation of human beings on a mass scale period.
[02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:20.400]  And I think there's a lot of people in that world that would rather replace human beings with AI, with robots, with technology, with drones, and all the rest.
[02:07:20.821 --> 02:07:23.063]  And I think it's no longer a science fiction film.
[02:07:23.423 --> 02:07:25.886]  Increasingly, it's a real risk given their mindset.
[02:07:25.926 --> 02:07:27.388]  When they're willing to endanger
[02:07:27.868 --> 02:07:27.928]  Oh.
[02:07:47.404 --> 02:07:47.904]  We're good to go.
[02:08:05.129 --> 02:08:15.776]  We're at this real point where the billionaires have stolen the wealth, they've got the control, they're surveilling us, they don't respect us, they own the governments, no one's standing up against us, and now we're seeing their dream, which is a dystopia.
[02:08:16.236 --> 02:08:25.322]  Everyone, whether you're a cook, or whether you're a lawyer, or whether you're a security person, these globalists have got to ask yourselves, what is it worth to keep serving these people?
[02:08:25.362 --> 02:08:26.063]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:08:27.077 --> 02:08:27.317]  Exactly.
[02:08:27.337 --> 02:08:33.858]  If you look at history, governments collapse when as little as 20% of the population just mass resists unlawful action.
[02:08:34.299 --> 02:08:35.539]  It doesn't take a majority.
[02:08:35.599 --> 02:08:37.799]  It doesn't take tens of millions or hundreds of millions.
[02:08:38.179 --> 02:08:47.321]  It just takes enough people acting on their conscience, doing what's correct, democratically, peacefully, within the process, and the system collapses of its own lack of credibility.
[02:08:47.741 --> 02:08:55.103]  And especially if you start seeing police officers, soldiers, sheriffs, sergeants, and captains start to do that too.
[02:08:55.683 --> 02:08:57.524]  Then the whole system collapses overnight.
[02:08:58.004 --> 02:09:00.105]  And that's Michael Malice's point all along.
[02:09:00.265 --> 02:09:07.628]  That all we need is enough police and sheriffs and soldiers to say, no, I won't obey an unconstitutional order and the system is over.
[02:09:07.948 --> 02:09:11.610]  That's how almost every major totalitarian government has collapsed in history.
[02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:14.171]  And it's often just because enough people resist.
[02:09:14.471 --> 02:09:18.933]  For every person in front of a tank, you just need someone driving that tank to stop driving it.
[02:09:19.173 --> 02:09:19.614]  And that's why...
[02:09:37.515 --> 02:09:39.137]  That's why they want AI to watch us.
[02:09:39.177 --> 02:09:40.539]  The real goal isn't just robots.
[02:09:40.879 --> 02:09:55.135]  It's AI watching and controlling us, plugged into our ears and our eyes, telling the police and military when they do right, when they don't do right, when we do right, we don't right, to train us to instinctively follow its orders so we kill our instincts of self-preservation and common sense and become automatons.
[02:09:55.836 --> 02:09:57.157]  We're a bunch of perverts.
[02:09:57.217 --> 02:10:01.001]  I mean, have you seen Steve Jobs' wife hanging out with Ghislaine Maxwell and all this?
[02:10:01.361 --> 02:10:03.903]  I mean, these people, it's all coming out.
[02:10:03.963 --> 02:10:05.685]  Robert Barnes, amazing analysis.
[02:10:06.626 --> 02:10:07.346]  Great points.
[02:10:08.227 --> 02:10:12.311]  Tell people how they find your shows, how they find the great stuff you do.
[02:10:12.851 --> 02:10:16.034]  And then I forgot the little side addendum or dessert.
[02:10:17.475 --> 02:10:19.637]  Do you think Trump will really run in 2024?
[02:10:20.117 --> 02:10:24.120]  And like you said with Andrew Jackson, it looks like he would probably win even bigger if he did.
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:26.061]  I've talked to some big Washington insiders.
[02:10:26.101 --> 02:10:27.182]  I know you've talked to him as well.
[02:10:28.003 --> 02:10:34.847]  And even though Trump has told people he probably won't run, but just wants to get good Republicans elected, wants to fix the election process, they don't believe him.
[02:10:35.708 --> 02:10:39.471]  Even though a lot of people I know have talked to the president, and I'll leave it at that, he says he probably isn't.
[02:10:39.891 --> 02:10:41.332]  They are really scared of Trump.
[02:10:41.392 --> 02:10:42.493]  And so why is that?
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:50.264]  So, my understanding is Trump definitely does plan on running in 2024, but wants to play coy until the last possible minute, publicly.
[02:10:50.564 --> 02:10:54.086]  But what he's doing behind the scenes, he clearly plans on running.
[02:10:54.506 --> 02:10:57.728]  Well, that's what I'm talking about, but the people tapping his phone say that's the case.
[02:10:57.748 --> 02:10:59.749]  I mean, they say, no, no, Trump's coming back.
[02:11:00.948 --> 02:11:04.449]  I mean, he was just meeting with Mark Meadows, setting up a kind of shadow cabinet.
[02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:06.910]  So he's doing the things that show the sign.
[02:11:07.150 --> 02:11:09.831]  Don't listen to Trump's words, basically, for people out there.
[02:11:10.112 --> 02:11:10.992]  Look at what he's doing.
[02:11:11.372 --> 02:11:14.413]  And he's acting like someone who's absolutely planning on running.
[02:11:14.773 --> 02:11:16.594]  So I think he plans on running in 2024.
[02:11:17.294 --> 02:11:18.995]  And this is another place where the audits would help him.
[02:11:19.475 --> 02:11:21.396]  I mean, it doesn't need to be restored.
[02:11:21.436 --> 02:11:23.918]  That's just not legally, like, can happen, frankly.
[02:11:24.298 --> 02:11:29.461]  But if we show in these audits that the election was stolen, it gives them the same credibility Andrew Jackson had.
[02:11:29.822 --> 02:11:33.504]  And that led to political change for 30 years, not just four years.
[02:11:33.904 --> 02:11:35.245]  So I think it's very impactful.
[02:11:35.265 --> 02:11:36.866]  Spend a minute on that for people who don't know.
[02:11:36.886 --> 02:11:40.848]  It took Jackson from being a Southern leader to an American super leader.
[02:11:40.908 --> 02:11:46.052]  Everyone behind him, basically dictatorial power, which he didn't even want because they knew it was stolen from them.
[02:11:46.092 --> 02:11:46.472]  Explain that.
[02:11:47.642 --> 02:11:50.245]  So in 1824, Andrew Jackson Rand should have won.
[02:11:50.285 --> 02:11:52.206]  They stole it from him in Congress.
[02:11:52.727 --> 02:11:54.629]  So somebody came to him to help build.
[02:11:54.649 --> 02:11:58.493]  He helped create the first political party, the Democratic Party, in a meaningful way.
[02:11:58.953 --> 02:12:09.103]  He created the most mass campaigning ever done so that he won so big in 1828 that for the next 32 years, his politics would dominate and it would be the peak
[02:12:09.663 --> 02:12:10.063]  Absolutely.
[02:12:10.103 --> 02:12:13.024]  That's when it became the People's America.
[02:12:13.064 --> 02:12:15.966]  That's when it became a populist America.
[02:12:15.986 --> 02:12:22.288]  That's when it became fully honoring the original hopes of the Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution and Thomas Paine.
[02:12:41.078 --> 02:12:43.378]  And so again, they stole it from him, only made him bigger.
[02:12:43.419 --> 02:12:45.779]  And I think if Trump just takes care of himself, he can do it.
[02:12:45.839 --> 02:12:48.099]  How do you expect him to attack Trump in the process to stop him?
[02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:54.801]  Well, I think that's where these audits help because otherwise they'll attack him saying he's faking and making up stories and all the rest.
[02:12:55.481 --> 02:12:57.741]  So that's where it's very important that that happen.
[02:12:58.022 --> 02:13:00.202]  Continues to defend himself in the court of public opinion.
[02:13:00.482 --> 02:13:02.763]  What he mostly needs to do is hire a lot.
[02:13:03.123 --> 02:13:04.823]  He needs to improve on his advisors.
[02:13:06.404 --> 02:13:09.747]  He put in a lot of people that the insiders and the Bushites told him to put in.
[02:13:10.147 --> 02:13:13.650]  He needs to stay away from those folks and improve the quality.
[02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:14.791]  That's what Andrew Jackson did.
[02:13:15.011 --> 02:13:18.253]  He went with a whole different set of advisors, and that's why he dominated in 1928.
[02:13:19.414 --> 02:13:23.037]  Trump needs to make the same correction, the same course correction.
[02:13:23.737 --> 02:13:29.742]  He's had some architects and some engineers and some construction designers that have been building some shoddy buildings.
[02:13:30.122 --> 02:13:33.745]  So even though he has a beautiful vision, that vision hasn't become reality.
[02:13:33.985 --> 02:13:41.031]  He needs different construction engineers, different project managers, different architects to make his vision become real.
[02:13:42.196 --> 02:13:45.017]  And he's certainly a lot more hardcore now.
[02:13:45.597 --> 02:13:47.338]  I understand he got conned by the vaccines.
[02:13:47.358 --> 02:13:50.719]  I understand that he got roped into that to reopen the economy.
[02:13:50.739 --> 02:13:53.820]  And I see him starting to hedge his bet and say, yeah, I don't trust the Democrats.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:56.181]  But I think Trump really, what would be the path?
[02:13:56.201 --> 02:13:58.942]  Then I will let you go because our next guest is ready and I appreciate you, Barnes.
[02:13:59.482 --> 02:14:03.544]  What would Trump's path to be to extricate himself from this vaccine nightmare?
[02:14:03.584 --> 02:14:06.125]  Because that's the big thing turning people off to Trump right now.
[02:14:07.264 --> 02:14:10.306]  Well, what he should do is he should come out and say he's opposed any mandate, period.
[02:14:10.686 --> 02:14:13.048]  He should say this, we always believe in informed consent.
[02:14:13.488 --> 02:14:22.415]  And that what he should say is, if I was the one monitoring this process, if I was the one managing this process, if I was the one pushing this process, people could have confidence in it.
[02:14:22.675 --> 02:14:28.779]  But you can't have confidence in what the Biden administration is doing because they're not being transparent, they're not being open, and they're trying to force it on people.
[02:14:29.239 --> 02:14:36.983]  And so he should come out fully and firmly to say it should always be your choice whether to take a vaccine, and that should always be your empowerment.
[02:14:37.224 --> 02:14:42.286]  So to make it clear, because he said he would never support a vaccine mandate, he should be stronger on that.
[02:14:42.366 --> 02:14:56.114]  Quit listening to Lindsey Graham, who just got sick from COVID after being double vaccinated, and instead go out there and say, no, no, that's anti-American to try to compel and control a person's body, and he should start attacking Bill Gates.
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:01.763]  I agree, because Bill Gates is the most unpopular person in modern history.
[02:15:01.803 --> 02:15:06.227]  He's a chief Hitler-level scorn, and he deserves it because he's just radiating evil.
[02:15:07.188 --> 02:15:11.332]  And then that would also then give him somebody bigger that transcends political party.
[02:15:11.612 --> 02:15:15.676]  He would get so many Democrats, so many liberals supporting him if he would just go after Gates.
[02:15:17.157 --> 02:15:17.637]  Absolutely.
[02:15:17.818 --> 02:15:22.482]  I mean, not only that, I mean, Gates, people should show him the stuff that Gates has said about him over the years.
[02:15:23.044 --> 02:15:31.832]  So, I mean, I've got it to people around him, but they should really continue, continually remind him of what Gates has said, how sarcastic and nasty he is about Trump.
[02:15:31.872 --> 02:15:51.088]  Trump would read that quickly, and maybe that would help, you know, help remind him, because Trump had the idea to put Bobby Kennedy in charge of a vaccine safety committee while he was there, and he backed off in part because of Bill Gates, and then Bill Gates turned around and made fun of him at every gathering he's ever been at, some of which is on tape.
[02:15:51.528 --> 02:15:54.689]  And so the world should, he should be reminded of who this guy is.
[02:15:55.049 --> 02:15:59.231]  He's enemy number one, and start to go after him, go full scale after him.
[02:15:59.591 --> 02:16:10.455]  And I think that would help remind people that whatever his position in making the vaccine available to people, it was never about forcing it on people, and that that's deeply opposed to the core of who he is.
[02:16:10.715 --> 02:16:13.836]  I mean, to my knowledge, he himself never took the vaccine himself.
[02:16:14.816 --> 02:16:17.317]  All right, Robert Barnes, thank you so much for the time.
[02:16:17.377 --> 02:16:18.858]  One more time, where do people find your show?
[02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:20.420]  Sure.
[02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:21.841]  People can find any of the letters.
[02:16:21.861 --> 02:16:23.041]  I'm getting emails about the letters.
[02:16:23.402 --> 02:16:25.182]  Letters about religious objections.
[02:16:25.563 --> 02:16:27.744]  Letters about other objections to the vaccine.
[02:16:28.104 --> 02:16:34.267]  People can find examples of that at VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[02:16:34.527 --> 02:16:37.388]  VivaBarnesLaw.Locals.com.
[02:16:37.588 --> 02:16:37.908]  All right.
[02:16:37.968 --> 02:16:42.971]  Thanks for joining us on this very special commercial-free Saturday transmission.
[02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:44.831]  There goes Robert Barnes.
[02:16:44.992 --> 02:16:45.352]  All right.
[02:16:46.232 --> 02:16:48.393]  Our next guest, we've got him for 45 minutes.
[02:16:48.573 --> 02:16:51.473]  I again really appreciate him coming on.
[02:16:51.633 --> 02:17:04.857]  I wanted to give him a chance, commercial free, to have me try to shut up and let him roll out how he woke up, who he is, kind of a condensed deal if he can, and then what he discovered and what's currently unfolding
[02:17:05.157 --> 02:17:08.379]  And then his new film, which he's graciously put up for the world free.
[02:17:08.759 --> 02:17:12.041]  His films all together have probably been seen by a billion people or more.
[02:17:12.101 --> 02:17:17.704]  The Cosmic Hoax is also posted for free at man.video and freeworldnews.tv.
[02:17:17.784 --> 02:17:23.107]  So here is the trailer for The Cosmic Hoax, and then Dr. Stephen Greer joins us.
[02:17:54.304 --> 02:17:56.484]  I've been warning about this for decades.
[02:17:57.745 --> 02:17:58.945]  No, not that.
[02:17:59.145 --> 02:17:59.285]  This.
[02:18:23.953 --> 02:18:32.416]  Speaking of conspiracy theories that actually have truth at the bottom of them, the Corona Relief Bill the President signed last month contains a provision that hasn't gotten a lot of attention.
[02:18:33.096 --> 02:18:41.098]  It directs the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the heads of other agencies, to disclose what they know about UFOs within 180 days.
[02:18:41.158 --> 02:18:43.219]  So what are they going to tell us?
[02:18:44.949 --> 02:18:53.871]  I provided briefings for four presidents, barn heads of state, generals, and a sitting CIA director who later betrayed me.
[02:18:54.791 --> 02:18:56.271]  I've seen lives destroyed.
[02:18:56.291 --> 02:18:59.312]  William Colby has been missing since April 27th.
[02:19:00.292 --> 02:19:03.893]  His canoe was found washed up on the banks of the Wicomico River.
[02:19:04.533 --> 02:19:05.613]  Friends murdered.
[02:19:06.494 --> 02:19:09.094]  Unthinkable evil unleashed on our planet.
[02:19:09.914 --> 02:19:12.735]  All to protect this illegal and immoral secrecy.
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:19.764]  And nothing I've seen scares me more than this unprecedented moment we are living through.
[02:19:24.287 --> 02:19:29.310]  We're in the final hour of an agenda that has been playing out for nearly a century.
[02:19:30.011 --> 02:19:43.881]  Centralized monopolies of power in government, the defense industry, and the corporate media are all converging on the same narrative that extraterrestrials are real, they're here, and they're a threat.
[02:19:44.488 --> 02:19:45.729]  Those are not weather balloons.
[02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:52.573]  Those are clearly autonomous aircraft of some kind that are, as you put it, swarming U.S.
[02:19:52.613 --> 02:19:53.794]  military craft.
[02:19:54.394 --> 02:19:57.216]  These are craft under intelligent control.
[02:19:57.236 --> 02:20:03.480]  These are craft under intelligent control and they're flying with impunity, Tucker, within our airspace.
[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:09.023]  And they can outmaneuver, outperform anything that we seem to have.
[02:20:09.423 --> 02:20:13.706]  We need to find out who's operating them and also what the intent is.
[02:20:15.117 --> 02:20:17.580]  The truth is, we do know who's operating them.
[02:20:18.561 --> 02:20:24.187]  Some are indeed extraterrestrial, and they are absolutely not a threat, as you will see.
[02:20:24.207 --> 02:20:37.061]  It is, in fact, the secrecy that is an existential threat to life on Earth and beyond, as stated by the first CIA director, Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenketer.
[02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:52.037]  In 2020, I was asked to brief the President and Vice President on a situation that completely spiraled out of their control.
[02:20:52.857 --> 02:20:56.060]  They had been lied to, just as you have been lied to.
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:01.004]  And we cannot stop what is coming if we don't finally confront the truth.
[02:21:11.075 --> 02:21:12.757]  And we are back with Dr. Steven Greer.
[02:21:12.777 --> 02:21:15.179]  I'm not going to go over his lengthy and amazing bio.
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:18.523]  I'm just going to try for the next 40 minutes or so that we have him on this Saturday.
[02:21:18.563 --> 02:21:29.074]  Very gracious to spend time with us to just try to give people the compendium or a boil down of where we are as a species on this planet and who some of these different factions are.
[02:21:29.395 --> 02:21:30.756]  Thank you so much for joining us, Doctor.
[02:21:31.857 --> 02:21:32.958]  It's great to be with you again.
[02:21:33.871 --> 02:21:40.918]  So please, I mean, however you want to tell it, at the beginning, through the middle, skip to the end, just all the incredible things that are happening right now on this amazing planet.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:50.127]  Well, the big thing that's been happening over the last couple of years is unfortunately a big push by what people call the deep state.
[02:21:50.287 --> 02:21:53.731]  These are actually unacknowledged special access projects.
[02:21:54.295 --> 02:22:20.432]  that are pushing out a false narrative about there being some kind of threat from UFOs, UAPs, and this is something we've warned about since the 90s, where we learned that there was a scheme that had been concocted beginning in the 1950s to hoax UFO and alien events so that eventually they could unite the world around a global super state
[02:22:21.204 --> 02:22:24.666]  That is fascist in its roots and in its orientation.
[02:22:25.286 --> 02:22:27.847]  Now there are extraterrestrial civilizations out there.
[02:22:29.287 --> 02:22:47.115]  We have very great archives of evidence on this, but what most people are being seen in the mainstream media, if you turn on Fox News with Tucker Carlson and a lot of these others, they have people on there who have been in the system who are telling a consistent number of lies.
[02:22:47.791 --> 02:22:52.172]  About this subject, the big one is that it's a threat to the national security, which it is not.
[02:22:53.273 --> 02:23:04.236]  The other big lies that they tell very consistently in the past year or two, if you've been following the mainstream news on this, is that these objects, we have no idea what they are.
[02:23:04.836 --> 02:23:08.057]  When in reality, we figured out that there were extraterrestrial vehicles.
[02:23:08.476 --> 02:23:11.282]  They were called Foo Fighters, by the way, in World War II.
[02:23:11.322 --> 02:23:15.311]  There was a rock band, but the actual Foo Fighters were UFOs in World War II.
[02:23:16.033 --> 02:23:17.095]  And then, beginning in 1954,
[02:23:19.350 --> 02:23:24.075]  My uncle worked for Northrop Grumman, designed the lunar module, put the first man on the moon.
[02:23:24.836 --> 02:23:39.109]  And I learned as a little kid that, you know, we had man-made aircraft that looked like UFOs that began to be test flown reliably under controlled, what we call gravity control, in October of 1954.
[02:23:41.131 --> 02:23:50.422]  So, these objects that you're showing, for example, to your audience that's been in the mainstream news, those are Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin classified aircraft.
[02:23:50.922 --> 02:23:53.485]  And yet they're telling the public, gee, we don't have these.
[02:23:54.026 --> 02:23:55.588]  We don't know how these operate.
[02:23:56.308 --> 02:23:59.289]  We need to study this some more, which is what they always say.
[02:23:59.309 --> 02:24:04.150]  Let's put it into a committee in Congress to study it some more when they know damn good and well what they are.
[02:24:04.450 --> 02:24:07.451]  And just to interrupt briefly, what you said when you were on the show earlier in the week is so key.
[02:24:08.191 --> 02:24:09.071]  Forget the aliens.
[02:24:09.111 --> 02:24:12.512]  That's important, but they have free energy technology.
[02:24:12.812 --> 02:24:17.794]  This would free the earth and create peace and stop all these problems and the need for depopulation.
[02:24:18.174 --> 02:24:18.914]  And so you're right.
[02:24:18.974 --> 02:24:21.614]  I mean, it's well known to people in the military that I know everything.
[02:24:21.875 --> 02:24:23.435]  They don't even hide this hardly anymore.
[02:24:23.755 --> 02:24:27.218]  That you're in like Montana at night and the flying V's are everywhere, they're landing, they're taking off.
[02:24:27.258 --> 02:24:29.539]  They got flashing lights on the bottom when they come in for landings.
[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:32.962]  But they're making turns that no known technology could do.
[02:24:33.262 --> 02:24:36.745]  So the big enchilada is they're suppressing technology.
[02:24:37.845 --> 02:24:46.092]  Yes, and this is the area I always tell people, when you see one of these things on the news, just remember that's an alternative energy and propulsion device.
[02:24:46.812 --> 02:24:49.254]  You know, it doesn't have rockets, it doesn't have jets.
[02:24:49.274 --> 02:24:51.255]  I mean, jets and rockets were 30s, 40s.
[02:24:53.085 --> 02:25:09.363]  And I think people need to realize that the world, the way it is now, is sort of a big, I call it planet gulag, where everyone are sort of slaves on the plantation of a bunch of fascist, industrial, moneyed people.
[02:25:09.763 --> 02:25:13.968]  And I mean the super elites and controlling trillions of dollars, because you're looking at
[02:25:15.129 --> 02:25:21.414]  The technology behind these objects is the biggest secret in the history of the world, and this is not an overstatement.
[02:25:21.754 --> 02:25:25.877]  It is why it was ridiculed so much and marginalized.
[02:25:26.358 --> 02:25:28.980]  But people on the inside take this very seriously.
[02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:41.990]  I mean, I have a letter from the first director of the CIA writing to the New York Times around the time Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex, stating that the secrecy around UFOs
[02:25:42.626 --> 02:25:48.632]  Is a threat to the national security of the United States, not the UFOs, the secrecy.
[02:25:49.072 --> 02:25:53.977]  So we're dealing with a really huge problem here that's been going on now for about 70 years.
[02:25:54.477 --> 02:25:56.039]  It has not been addressed properly.
[02:25:56.239 --> 02:25:57.400]  And it's very dangerous.
[02:25:57.640 --> 02:26:04.507]  In fact, that it has not been addressed because when I have met with members of Congress, people in the executive branch.
[02:26:05.339 --> 02:26:09.080]  Personally briefed the CIA director for Bill Clinton and others.
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:14.481]  What I have found is that most of these people have no idea what's going on on this subject.
[02:26:14.821 --> 02:26:17.921]  Explain compartmentalization for those that don't know, Dr. Greer, please.
[02:26:18.361 --> 02:26:19.702]  Just briefly, compartmentalization.
[02:26:20.782 --> 02:26:24.503]  Yes, when this is what they're called top secret special compartmented information.
[02:26:24.943 --> 02:26:30.704]  So what they do is that everyone knows about, you know, we have confidential, secret, top secret.
[02:26:32.347 --> 02:26:40.034]  Beyond, if you will, that level of normal covert classifications, which is needed in government.
[02:26:40.054 --> 02:26:42.477]  I mean, this is not anything unusual around the world.
[02:26:42.977 --> 02:26:47.181]  There's a level called unacknowledged special access projects.
[02:26:47.557 --> 02:26:48.718]  Or SAPs, S-A-P.
[02:26:48.738 --> 02:26:52.760]  So the unacknowledged special access projects, let's call them USAPs.
[02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:59.943]  These are the ones that are run off the books, deep black, no oversight by our representatives.
[02:27:00.323 --> 02:27:05.546]  And most presidents know very little, if anything, about what's going on in those projects.
[02:27:06.066 --> 02:27:10.168]  That is what Eisenhower warned about when he said, beware the military-industrial complex.
[02:27:10.468 --> 02:27:11.869]  And he was a five-star general.
[02:27:12.729 --> 02:27:13.490]  And a Republican.
[02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:16.553]  It wasn't like it was Abby Hoffman that said that, right?
[02:27:17.093 --> 02:27:21.797]  So this is people need to understand that what's behind the UFO story.
[02:27:22.324 --> 02:27:24.926]  It's the biggest secret in the history of the United States.
[02:27:25.467 --> 02:27:28.049]  It's secret for a reason, and it isn't a good one.
[02:27:28.649 --> 02:27:38.557]  It's to keep these technologies away from the public, so we stay dependent on a petrodollar supply chain and a global set of elites.
[02:27:38.577 --> 02:27:49.967]  Because otherwise, your house and your business and your studio and Mr. X's manufacturing facility would be running on free, what's called zero-point energy.
[02:27:50.700 --> 02:27:55.865]  We would have an abundance of wealth on the planet for every child of God.
[02:27:56.466 --> 02:28:03.472]  There would be no pollution, by the way, so you're not going to have to spend trillions of dollars on cap and trade and windmills and solar panels.
[02:28:04.033 --> 02:28:09.878]  So all of this has been kept secret since before I was alive.
[02:28:10.118 --> 02:28:11.620]  Did that really go back to Tesla?
[02:28:12.921 --> 02:28:13.721]  Yes, it goes well.
[02:28:13.781 --> 02:28:15.882]  Actually, it goes back before Tesla.
[02:28:15.983 --> 02:28:17.923]  Tesla certainly had these technologies.
[02:28:18.144 --> 02:28:28.809]  I have a document from the Department of Defense demanding that the FBI turn over to the Department of Defense all the secret papers that they confiscated when Nikola Tesla died.
[02:28:29.409 --> 02:28:32.570]  And by the way, Elon Musk does not have a Tesla car.
[02:28:32.991 --> 02:28:39.794]  He has a Musk, because a Tesla car you would not have to plug into a coal-fired or gas-fired electric grid, period.
[02:28:40.541 --> 02:28:50.786]  But the technologies that we're dealing with that have to do with electromagnetic field propulsion go back actually to the late 1800s, meant to late.
[02:28:51.426 --> 02:29:08.435]  So the discovery said, no, in fact, the next big feature film we want to do is on this lost century, I call it, of extraordinary technologies that has the secrecy around that, which was instituted by the early big billionaire industrial fascists.
[02:29:08.993 --> 02:29:11.778]  Has continued unbroken from that time to now.
[02:29:12.359 --> 02:29:14.403]  Which is why the world is in such a mess.
[02:29:14.843 --> 02:29:16.887]  And just to quantify that, what you're saying is...
[02:29:20.595 --> 02:29:22.437]  He's like, I apologize in a row because it's so fascinating.
[02:29:23.097 --> 02:29:27.981]  Growing up, they have the famous Greek batteries, the Roman batteries, the Chinese batteries.
[02:29:28.362 --> 02:29:34.106]  So what you're saying is they've developed a lot of this technology before, but it never got industrialized to a wide consumer scale.
[02:29:34.447 --> 02:29:39.091]  So a lot of this stuff's been discovered, but then it kind of gets hoarded or it gets forgotten or it never gets rolled out.
[02:29:40.552 --> 02:29:41.592]  Well, or worse.
[02:29:41.732 --> 02:29:48.855]  I mean, we have a document, a report from the Federation of American Scientists, a very mainstream scientific group.
[02:29:48.975 --> 02:29:50.036]  I'm a medical doctor.
[02:29:50.076 --> 02:29:51.536]  I follow science very carefully.
[02:29:52.297 --> 02:30:03.221]  And this document states that there are over 5,100 energy devices and related patents that have been confiscated under national security orders
[02:30:03.861 --> 02:30:04.782]  By the patent office.
[02:30:04.802 --> 02:30:10.725]  Now this would include many of these devices, but also it doesn't include the ones that never make it to patent.
[02:30:11.005 --> 02:30:15.928]  They just flat out go in like jack-booted thugs and raid people's labs and steal it.
[02:30:16.228 --> 02:30:24.112]  I have many people on my team who have developed these technologies and have had people show up at their facilities and seized it.
[02:30:24.692 --> 02:30:27.934]  In fact, one man who was going to build one of these systems for my group
[02:30:29.095 --> 02:30:44.007]  Actually, when he hit the sweet spot and had one of these devices operational in 1974, he got a national security order and they stormed into his facility and actually confiscated everything and said, you're going to be working for us now.
[02:30:44.567 --> 02:30:50.672]  And ever since then, he's been working for a contractor for the CIA working on this stuff.
[02:30:50.872 --> 02:30:52.053]  But he's a genius.
[02:30:52.493 --> 02:30:55.556]  And so I tell people the most brilliant minds I have ever met,
[02:30:56.408 --> 02:30:57.469]  Yes, it is like the Dark Ages.
[02:30:57.509 --> 02:30:58.450]  And I think that
[02:31:19.031 --> 02:31:21.693]  It's really not people make these grand conspiracy theories.
[02:31:21.733 --> 02:31:25.036]  It's really about people with their own vested interests.
[02:31:25.076 --> 02:31:32.801]  For example, in the era of the Gilded Age, the likes of Rockefeller or Vanderbilt or J.P.
[02:31:32.841 --> 02:31:43.469]  Morgan, they didn't want this stuff to come out because poof, there goes all the oil and public utilities and, you know, 50% of their net worth goes up in smoke overnight.
[02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:48.373]  I think that we now have a situation where it's a thousand times worse than that.
[02:31:49.182 --> 02:31:54.424]  Where we have a whole planet that is using technologies literally from the 1800s.
[02:31:56.684 --> 02:31:59.445]  Your engine in your car, by the way, is Mercedes 1888.
[02:32:01.025 --> 02:32:14.049]  So I tell people that we are so far behind the curve, and the only way that's going to change is for it to be disclosed honestly, but people not to believe the nonsense they're being told, the lies that are being told in the mainstream media on this.
[02:32:15.581 --> 02:32:18.002]  Dr. Greer, how do we address a breakaway civilization?
[02:32:18.042 --> 02:32:31.849]  Because you know this, I know this, for the new listeners, you can just search disruptive technologies and the Federal Elections Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, all these groups that come after people for this, and they invade countries when they dare roll something out.
[02:32:31.929 --> 02:32:35.591]  So yes, we've got 130-year-old technologies that we operate on.
[02:32:35.951 --> 02:32:36.912]  They're suppressing it.
[02:32:38.092 --> 02:32:40.274]  How do you counter a breakaway of civilization?
[02:32:40.314 --> 02:32:48.860]  Because I see as the globalists break away from us and want to use all this technology, but don't want to have to hide it from us, they have an instinct to depopulate us.
[02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:57.225]  And I think that's why they keep saying this golden age, this new era is coming of peace, but they're saying once we're gone, because they don't want to share it with us.
[02:32:57.245 --> 02:32:59.247]  So I see what you're saying is an admitted fact.
[02:32:59.267 --> 02:33:00.167]  This is all going on.
[02:33:00.708 --> 02:33:04.110]  They're trying to create a fake war with aliens to get us to war against ourselves.
[02:33:04.650 --> 02:33:06.872]  And they don't want us to have access to all this technology.
[02:33:07.712 --> 02:33:12.621]  And they're really trying to set up a covert war through these different, you know, bioweapons they're releasing.
[02:33:12.661 --> 02:33:14.003]  I mean, I think that's really the issue.
[02:33:14.244 --> 02:33:15.286]  What's your view on that statement?
[02:33:15.306 --> 02:33:15.766]  Do you agree with that?
[02:33:17.139 --> 02:33:18.680]  Well, they are, but they've already done it.
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:34.928]  What people don't realize is that, for example, if you look at the materials we have in our books and documentaries, we have people who worked on these technologies, and actually we have the schematics for a circa late 1950s to early 1960s bell disc-shaped object.
[02:33:40.077 --> 02:33:45.320]  That was built that had gone around the solar system and was being seen at an air show.
[02:33:45.340 --> 02:33:50.903]  And I have the whole transcript of that event where Secretary of Defense Carlucci was there.
[02:33:51.663 --> 02:33:57.246]  And this is in 1980, I believe it's 86, in Norton Air Force Base in California.
[02:33:57.866 --> 02:34:01.608]  And there were three of these objects floating above the floor silently.
[02:34:02.208 --> 02:34:05.030]  And the small one was called the sports model.
[02:34:05.770 --> 02:34:12.375]  And you know, they were like 30 feet around 50 feet around 100 feet around and we have the drawings and schematics of that in our documentary.
[02:34:12.755 --> 02:34:20.701]  But what when you look at this, remember that those went all around the solar system back in the late 50s and 60s.
[02:34:21.182 --> 02:34:22.803]  Now, my uncle worked on the Apollo.
[02:34:23.542 --> 02:34:33.666]  Mission and design the lunar module that put the first man on the moon, but that was a separate program not Connected to these unacknowledged special access projects.
[02:34:34.146 --> 02:34:48.671]  So these technologies have been used for 60 70 years covertly They've been used around the earth to transport drugs to support the drug trade illegal arms and other clandestine and criminal organizations
[02:34:49.312 --> 02:34:54.874]  But I think that what the public has to understand is that we don't have to take those guys on.
[02:34:56.015 --> 02:35:01.937]  Your previous guest, I think, mentioned the fact that 20% of the people actually just resist the status quo.
[02:35:02.238 --> 02:35:04.799]  The whole system they are pushing on us falls apart.
[02:35:05.139 --> 02:35:06.779]  I think it's actually a smaller number.
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:12.502]  So this is why I left my medical career to disclose this information and tell people to do three things.
[02:35:13.380 --> 02:35:16.421]  One, support the disclosure of the truth of this issue.
[02:35:16.962 --> 02:35:26.626]  Number two, make teams that make contact with these extraterrestrial civilizations, because they're real, peacefully, on your own, and bypass the government who have mucked it up.
[02:35:27.126 --> 02:35:38.011]  And number three, we need an open source, public interest, research and development effort to develop these technologies where the lab is streamed on the internet,
[02:35:38.551 --> 02:35:45.235]  And every breakthrough is dumped around the world so that anyone can reproduce it, and we just bypass this secret system.
[02:35:45.736 --> 02:36:07.269]  If we were to do those things, and we the people, you know, my home where I'm sitting right now is down the road from Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, and I said, if we the people came together and actually did this, we would have a new planet, a new civilization within 10 to 20 years, and we'd actually be able to leave our children and our grandchildren something besides a ruined planet.
[02:36:07.537 --> 02:36:15.282]  Well let me ask you this, why do we see the Vatican, as you predicted 30 years ago coming out, or 25 years ago I heard you, coming out and saying, okay it's real, get ready for contact.
[02:36:15.802 --> 02:36:18.043]  Why do we see all this happening?
[02:36:18.063 --> 02:36:21.605]  And I understand, why wouldn't these things come in and take out the bad guys?
[02:36:21.625 --> 02:36:24.207]  I guess they don't get involved in our affairs, that kind of makes sense.
[02:36:25.087 --> 02:36:30.514]  But just in those areas, because obviously you look at all the ancient cultures said they talked to these people.
[02:36:30.994 --> 02:36:33.297]  All these ancient cultures said that this was going on the Bible.
[02:36:33.597 --> 02:36:35.179]  You actually read it like a science fiction book.
[02:36:35.239 --> 02:36:36.861]  It's the Old Testament.
[02:36:36.881 --> 02:36:38.163]  It's like a damn UFO book.
[02:36:38.243 --> 02:36:40.445]  I mean, Ezekiel and all of it.
[02:36:40.505 --> 02:36:41.286]  It's all right there.
[02:36:42.728 --> 02:36:43.509]  Yeah, so it's amazing.
[02:36:43.849 --> 02:36:56.418]  So, I mean, do these other civilizations from your research have any connection, or are they just hoping we don't become a Type I civilization and then attack them, so they have to take us out?
[02:36:56.859 --> 02:36:59.020]  Hopefully we become a Type I civilization and are peaceful?
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:01.582]  I mean, any idea there, or is it just speculation?
[02:37:01.642 --> 02:37:03.023]  Yes, we have a very good idea.
[02:37:03.063 --> 02:37:08.727]  I have headed up a team that has initiated contact with these civilizations for 30 years.
[02:37:09.968 --> 02:37:16.291]  And we have a documentary out on Amazon Prime or Tubi called Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind.
[02:37:16.911 --> 02:37:22.653]  And I think if you look at that, you'll see that the evidence for the contact that's been made is overwhelming.
[02:37:23.173 --> 02:37:31.036]  What people have been misinformed about is that somehow there are competing interests of extraterrestrial groups out there fighting over the planet.
[02:37:31.576 --> 02:37:32.857]  This is delusional.
[02:37:33.497 --> 02:37:38.139]  If you have the ability to go from one star system to another technologically, there is nothing
[02:37:38.892 --> 02:37:48.080]  On this planet that that you would need to get here that you couldn't just materialize and create out of the technologies that permit interstellar travel.
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:51.223]  Now, what they are concerned about this is really clear.
[02:37:51.863 --> 02:38:01.672]  They're very concerned with the sort of ascendancy of covert power on this planet using very advanced technologies way past that of a nuclear bomb.
[02:38:02.233 --> 02:38:02.673]  We're good to go.
[02:38:30.026 --> 02:38:32.107]  Sure, so you're saying they're scripting towards a conflict?
[02:38:59.878 --> 02:39:01.879]  Yes, that was decided in the 50s.
[02:39:01.939 --> 02:39:15.087]  I have a document from 1953 written by the director of the CIA talking about this and specifically referring to using the UFO subject for its psychological warfare value.
[02:39:15.227 --> 02:39:16.728]  Now, this is 1953.
[02:39:17.329 --> 02:39:28.155]  So, this has been a very long-term strategic defense plan, very covert, and they have been working it very, very carefully over the last 70 years.
[02:39:29.281 --> 02:39:34.373]  Alright, I say this on air and it puts me on a limb, but when I've done it, the media hasn't attacked me and I don't care.
[02:39:34.814 --> 02:39:36.518]  And I'm not somebody that lies to our listeners and viewers.
[02:39:37.219 --> 02:39:37.801]  Over my life...
[02:39:39.031 --> 02:39:41.612]  I've had probably 15 dreams or so that come true later.
[02:39:42.072 --> 02:39:44.612]  And sometimes it's something innocuous, sometimes it's something very serious.
[02:39:45.352 --> 02:39:47.773]  And I've gotten where I've been told family about dreams and then they came true.
[02:39:48.413 --> 02:39:52.394]  Like the World Trade Center attack, the building smoking, that I told my ex-wife about it, told my dad about it.
[02:39:52.854 --> 02:39:55.294]  I went on air and I said they're going to blow up the World Trade Center in July.
[02:39:55.354 --> 02:39:58.855]  I said, I mean, because I have these dreams where I become physically sick after the dream.
[02:39:59.275 --> 02:40:03.136]  But it's almost like Close Encounters the Third Time where he's like building the thing and he sees this thing.
[02:40:03.576 --> 02:40:04.277]  Yes.
[02:40:04.658 --> 02:40:06.560]  And about a year ago, I just started praying to God.
[02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:09.925]  I said, if this stuff's all real, I want to be shown what's going on.
[02:40:09.945 --> 02:40:16.253]  And I had a series of three dreams where the feeling was complete bliss, total satisfaction and total completion.
[02:40:16.594 --> 02:40:19.498]  I didn't see what I was with, but it was like showing me and saying these things.
[02:40:20.078 --> 02:40:20.418]  Well, it is.
[02:40:20.438 --> 02:40:22.979]  I mean, we have to understand that the cosmos
[02:40:42.594 --> 02:40:43.695]  Tell people the story!
[02:41:12.335 --> 02:41:15.759]  Well, you know, I was raised in this very scientific family.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.462]  I didn't believe in anything humanist.
[02:41:19.272 --> 02:41:33.721]  I got very sick and had a near-death experience, and I had this beautiful experience of this infinite source of all good, the God state, if you will, and it was beautiful, and it completely changed my life.
[02:41:33.761 --> 02:41:46.669]  And six months later, I had a contact event with a group of extraterrestrials that were ETs, but they were very much connected to these higher states of spiritual reality and consciousness.
[02:41:47.259 --> 02:41:49.381]  And that really altered my life.
[02:41:49.982 --> 02:41:55.427]  And I began to look into this issue very thoroughly and began to have the same thing you had happen.
[02:41:55.447 --> 02:41:58.770]  I've had many, many lucid precognitive dreams.
[02:41:59.030 --> 02:42:02.813]  In fact, my wife, we're about this month, we're having our 42nd anniversary.
[02:42:03.154 --> 02:42:05.576]  I met her in a lucid dream when I was 22 years old.
[02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:08.510]  Exactly.
[02:42:09.090 --> 02:42:09.411]  Wow.
[02:42:09.511 --> 02:42:12.392]  I mean, for people, how many people do you think are experiencing this?
[02:42:12.432 --> 02:42:22.255]  Because I had a little bit of this when I was a child, but then man, this thing a year ago, like two more times, it is like, like you said, total love, total peace, total completion.
[02:42:22.275 --> 02:42:27.497]  And it's just, just choose this, just choose, choose.
[02:42:28.037 --> 02:42:29.338]  It's like, please don't.
[02:42:29.438 --> 02:42:29.678]  Yes.
[02:42:29.998 --> 02:42:30.358]  And we do.
[02:42:30.398 --> 02:42:35.900]  We as a people have to choose peace, freedom.
[02:42:36.876 --> 02:42:40.297]  An enlightened future, an era of thousands of years of peace.
[02:42:41.138 --> 02:42:52.682]  And to get there, we're going to have to completely extricate ourselves from these, I think, rather evil forces that are trying to drag us into endless war and endless war.
[02:42:53.382 --> 02:43:01.145]  And, you know, I've never been a particularly religious person, but I've always been, you know, since this near-death experience, very spiritually oriented.
[02:43:01.945 --> 02:43:04.866]  And I know that these civilizations that are very advanced,
[02:43:05.384 --> 02:43:05.584]  I think?
[02:43:24.750 --> 02:43:26.933]  They understand what you and I are talking about here.
[02:43:26.973 --> 02:43:33.180]  They understand what the physicists call non-locality, where everything is connected to every other point.
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:37.445]  And haven't they already been through that process of not destroying, you know, getting up to the higher level?
[02:43:38.436 --> 02:43:38.696]  Right.
[02:43:38.836 --> 02:43:44.280]  And the fact that they are here means they've made it past where we are and without destroying themselves.
[02:43:44.781 --> 02:43:46.322]  And that's actually very good news.
[02:43:46.342 --> 02:43:47.863]  When you meditate, think about that.
[02:43:48.543 --> 02:43:49.724]  That's a very good thing.
[02:43:49.784 --> 02:44:03.614]  Now, the flip side of that is they also know that humanity right at this moment, I mean, exactly at this instant that we're living on this planet, is at this crossroads where we're going to have to choose thousands of years of peace.
[02:44:04.395 --> 02:44:13.938]  And a spiritual existence on this planet and a high-tech existence using those technologies only for peaceful purposes, or we're going to become extinct.
[02:44:14.298 --> 02:44:18.339]  Which is the Atlantean moment, whether Atlantis... It is really a binary choice right now.
[02:44:18.659 --> 02:44:20.400]  Sorry to interrupt you, the key daughter, repeat that, sorry.
[02:44:21.681 --> 02:44:23.002]  You were saying we're in a binary moment.
[02:44:23.042 --> 02:44:24.043]  Repeat the last 20 seconds.
[02:44:24.063 --> 02:44:25.305]  Yeah, it's a binary moment.
[02:44:25.405 --> 02:44:26.486]  I call it the choice.
[02:44:26.686 --> 02:44:34.214]  And we're at a crossroads where we have to choose this good future or we're going to go through, in my opinion, a temporary shutdown.
[02:44:35.044 --> 02:44:36.785]  Phoenix like and have to get restarted.
[02:44:37.166 --> 02:44:42.989]  So I think that how that plays out is not, you know, determined by some Ouija board.
[02:44:43.390 --> 02:44:54.077]  It's determined what we do with our free will and our spiritual awareness and our social collective and to speak the truth and walk through and act with the truth.
[02:44:54.637 --> 02:44:57.899]  And I think that that's the way we, but we have to do it with eyes wide open.
[02:44:58.359 --> 02:44:59.700]  You know, I'm not a Pollyanna.
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:01.301]  I'm an emergency and trauma doctor.
[02:45:01.321 --> 02:45:03.362]  I've seen plenty of horrible things humans can do.
[02:45:04.002 --> 02:45:10.666]  And I have met with members of this cabal of sociopaths, and they are some really sick, crazy people.
[02:45:10.726 --> 02:45:19.430]  We're talking people who worship torture, death, destruction, warfare, involved in all kinds of evil stuff.
[02:45:20.151 --> 02:45:22.692]  And those people have enormous power.
[02:45:23.172 --> 02:45:24.273]  I mean, I agree with you.
[02:45:24.293 --> 02:45:26.515]  So why do you think the power structure seems to be upset?
[02:45:26.555 --> 02:45:29.558]  Is it because they realize more people are transcending?
[02:45:50.758 --> 02:45:53.179]  Because certainly they don't look like they think they're in power.
[02:45:53.219 --> 02:45:54.059]  They look really upset.
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:55.940]  Well, they're frantic.
[02:45:56.260 --> 02:46:00.842]  And one of the things that happened, we have a documentary called Unacknowledged, came out four years ago.
[02:46:01.342 --> 02:46:04.283]  That has had over 700 million people see it.
[02:46:04.783 --> 02:46:14.567]  When that happened is when they launched this to the STARS Academy and the whole initiative that led recently to the Director of National Intelligence.
[02:46:14.947 --> 02:46:15.448]  We're good to go.
[02:46:33.573 --> 02:46:37.637]  And we have top secret people speaking to this in the documentary.
[02:46:37.978 --> 02:46:47.747]  My book, Unacknowledged, has about five or ten times more information because it's a three or four hundred page book filled with documents and top secret witnesses testimony.
[02:46:48.188 --> 02:46:53.293]  But I think that when that happened, they pivoted around to try to capture the narrative.
[02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:55.221]  And this is what they always do.
[02:46:55.921 --> 02:46:58.962]  You know, we go forward and they're going to try to change the narrative.
[02:46:59.282 --> 02:47:08.526]  But the truth is, people can sense the fiction from the falsehood if it's explained well.
[02:47:09.027 --> 02:47:11.828]  And so that's what we're trying to do, is explain this.
[02:47:12.328 --> 02:47:16.810]  And I think that if people have the knowledge, they're going to make the right choices.
[02:47:17.515 --> 02:47:30.723]  Right now, unfortunately, the mainstream media has been banning a lot of what we're doing, a lot of shadow banning, a lot of refusal to cover the Disclosure Project revelations, which are huge.
[02:47:30.783 --> 02:47:36.987]  I mean, we have over 980 top secret military, corporate CIA whistleblowers.
[02:47:37.367 --> 02:47:40.909]  But interestingly, you do not see that in the New York Times or the Washington Post.
[02:47:41.409 --> 02:47:51.500]  So, they're only letting people speak to the people in the mass media, in the mainstream media, who are going to repeat these provable lies.
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:54.823]  And that's why we have to find alternative ways to get the message out.
[02:47:54.923 --> 02:48:01.189]  That's why we put the Cosmic Hoax out as an open source, free documentary that anyone can put.
[02:48:01.230 --> 02:48:04.293]  We have it on blockchain sites, so it can't be taken down.
[02:48:05.073 --> 02:48:08.075]  And we encourage people to look at it and download it.
[02:48:08.135 --> 02:48:12.318]  You can download it for free and share it on your site so long as it's not a commercial site.
[02:48:12.338 --> 02:48:13.518]  You can put it anywhere you want.
[02:48:13.799 --> 02:48:16.520]  The Cosmic Hoax at Band.Video.
[02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:18.922]  So let me pick your brain about this because you have this experience.
[02:48:19.522 --> 02:48:20.262]  It's not just you.
[02:48:20.382 --> 02:48:23.184]  Every culture people have near death, they see the same thing.
[02:48:23.584 --> 02:48:25.966]  They see these portals, the light, they get transferred there.
[02:48:28.087 --> 02:48:30.248]  I literally was just praying or getting my mind to focus on it.
[02:48:30.288 --> 02:48:32.028]  Like, okay, I've had these dreams come true.
[02:48:32.048 --> 02:48:33.309]  I want to know who's giving this to me.
[02:48:33.329 --> 02:48:34.029]  I wasn't stupid.
[02:48:34.049 --> 02:48:34.969]  It obviously wasn't me.
[02:48:35.670 --> 02:48:38.711]  And I got like, it was, it was indescribable what I saw.
[02:48:38.751 --> 02:48:39.431]  It was unbelievable.
[02:48:39.871 --> 02:48:52.016]  And it was just so much data and it was so beautiful and it was nirvana, but beyond that, but then also I could look and then see all these civilizations that decided to encapsulate themselves, not be connected to everything.
[02:48:52.056 --> 02:48:53.096]  And like, they were like tombs.
[02:48:53.116 --> 02:48:54.736]  It was like all these other things.
[02:48:55.157 --> 02:48:55.897]  And I, and I'm, and,
[02:48:57.122 --> 02:49:02.346]  Expanding on that, why are people on this planet not connected to that?
[02:49:02.407 --> 02:49:05.909]  And why is the ruling class trying to keep people from that?
[02:49:05.970 --> 02:49:09.753]  Why would they not want to interface with the infinite and be eternal?
[02:49:10.233 --> 02:49:15.558]  Why would they want to wall themselves up in these tombs, is the way I would describe it, these boxes?
[02:49:16.959 --> 02:49:25.066]  Well, I think the ultimate empowering experience is the type of enlightenment and
[02:49:25.725 --> 02:49:26.206]  Thank you.
[02:49:44.082 --> 02:49:55.432]  Yes, of course, and the thesis for that is no one has access to the Great Spirit or any of this spiritual experience and information except through some anointed person.
[02:49:55.812 --> 02:50:07.542]  And I think people have to understand that folded within every single soul on this planet and throughout other planets is the totality of the cosmos, the entire cosmic being.
[02:50:08.044 --> 02:50:14.549]  And everything that exists is actually folded like a quantum hologram within every conscious spirit.
[02:50:14.869 --> 02:50:15.970]  It is actually within you.
[02:50:16.370 --> 02:50:18.511]  And this is what it says in the Bible, the Kingdom of God is within.
[02:50:18.892 --> 02:50:20.213]  So it's actually within you.
[02:50:20.573 --> 02:50:24.876]  And so people when they experience that, they can then go beyond
[02:50:25.396 --> 02:50:31.338]  The limitations of, say, the catechisms of some structure, which can be useful for people.
[02:50:31.378 --> 02:50:33.179]  I'm not saying that there's no value in that.
[02:50:33.659 --> 02:50:39.861]  But people have to go beyond that to reach their own state of enlightenment and experience.
[02:50:40.441 --> 02:50:44.402]  And, you know, I guess luckily for me, I got very sick and almost died.
[02:50:44.462 --> 02:50:48.123]  Otherwise, goodness knows if I'd ever have experienced and known this.
[02:50:49.164 --> 02:50:52.184]  I think also I always had these dreams like you're referring to.
[02:50:52.605 --> 02:50:53.365]  Some of that may be
[02:50:54.344 --> 02:51:06.554]  My grandmother was Native American Cherokee, and there's a big tradition of this kind of lucid dreaming amongst Native peoples, and certainly the aboriginals in Australia have what they call dream time.
[02:51:07.075 --> 02:51:09.097]  So, I think that this is folded within.
[02:51:09.137 --> 02:51:10.478]  We think it's very esoteric.
[02:51:10.498 --> 02:51:10.878]  It isn't.
[02:51:11.258 --> 02:51:16.203]  It's actually innate to the human spirit, but it's also innate to the extraterrestrial consciousness.
[02:51:16.703 --> 02:51:20.826]  So, one of the interesting things that I discovered was in the early 1900s, 1908,
[02:51:23.287 --> 02:51:30.812]  A guy who started quantum physics, a particle wave theory, Erwin Schrödinger, said the total number of minds
[02:51:31.784 --> 02:51:33.025]  In the universe is one.
[02:51:33.405 --> 02:51:34.326]  It's a singularity.
[02:51:34.686 --> 02:51:35.867]  That's that great spirit.
[02:51:36.407 --> 02:51:40.830]  You know, the absolute field of, you call it the God aspect.
[02:51:41.311 --> 02:51:44.893]  And that is very real, but it's within every single... I totally agree.
[02:51:44.933 --> 02:51:46.194]  So we need to know our enemy, though.
[02:51:46.614 --> 02:51:48.256]  What is this other thing?
[02:51:49.296 --> 02:51:50.797]  Like, it tombs itself off.
[02:51:51.057 --> 02:51:54.140]  It wants to be separate, but then it also wants to dominate us.
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:55.160]  Like, what would you call that?
[02:51:55.240 --> 02:51:56.141]  Where does that come from?
[02:51:56.621 --> 02:51:57.342]  Just out of free will?
[02:51:57.682 --> 02:51:59.243]  Well, that's ignorance.
[02:51:59.323 --> 02:52:01.025]  I mean, that's if you want to look at it that way.
[02:52:01.065 --> 02:52:10.612]  Those are people or forces that want to keep everyone separated from that power that is within us and the light that is within us.
[02:52:11.133 --> 02:52:12.274]  And this is, of course,
[02:52:13.513 --> 02:52:16.697]  Part of, you know, the drama of creation.
[02:52:17.297 --> 02:52:27.208]  And the interesting thing about humans is that we have free will and we can choose to either be a sleepwalker sheeple or we can choose to be awake and empowered.
[02:52:27.568 --> 02:52:28.930]  It takes courage to be awake.
[02:52:29.859 --> 02:52:32.721]  And it takes courage then to act on the vision of being awake.
[02:52:33.181 --> 02:52:37.884]  And I think that this is what I think many people are opening to this.
[02:52:38.404 --> 02:52:47.250]  And I think folks who want to maintain a sort of certain amount of control over the populace, they know that that's slipping away.
[02:52:47.630 --> 02:52:53.214]  That that era of corrupt, centralized control and ignorance is slipping away.
[02:52:53.314 --> 02:52:55.035]  And is that why this all seems so desperate?
[02:52:55.055 --> 02:52:57.356]  That's when they get desperate though, you know, Alex.
[02:52:57.396 --> 02:52:58.577]  This is when they get desperate.
[02:52:59.119 --> 02:53:06.564]  And I think they know that that era, that ride that they've had, is coming to an end, and so they're doing rather desperate things at this point.
[02:53:06.864 --> 02:53:09.926]  So that's why it seems so over-the-top and ridiculous to those of us who are awake.
[02:53:10.286 --> 02:53:11.587]  What are they trying to do?
[02:53:11.647 --> 02:53:17.931]  Because to me, it's going to create resentment and rebellion and war, which I don't even want war with these people.
[02:53:18.452 --> 02:53:20.633]  You know, I mean, 30 years ago I was younger and dumber.
[02:53:20.673 --> 02:53:21.914]  Maybe war's not in front of me now.
[02:53:21.954 --> 02:53:23.015]  I don't even want war with them.
[02:53:23.255 --> 02:53:25.957]  But they just keep poking and pushing, and they want that war.
[02:53:27.608 --> 02:53:36.395]  Well, I think they want to see how far they can dominate not just one culture, but the whole global culture and get away with it.
[02:53:36.735 --> 02:53:53.287]  And I think they're pushing those limits because there's another trend line, there's another force happening of freedom, of enlightenment, of a future that's the end of war and the end of this whole past era and the opening of another era and human
[02:53:53.667 --> 02:53:54.467]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:54:13.434 --> 02:54:16.695]  All the cartels and what have you, the Middle Ages and Dark Ages.
[02:54:17.095 --> 02:54:26.478]  So I think we're in a period where the only way this is going to get resolved is enough people knowing the truth, acting in concert.
[02:54:26.979 --> 02:54:29.279]  I don't think it requires any violence at all.
[02:54:29.319 --> 02:54:33.781]  It really requires an awakening and then very decisive action.
[02:54:34.521 --> 02:54:35.441]  It does take courage.
[02:54:35.502 --> 02:54:37.362]  I've had people on my team assassinated.
[02:54:38.102 --> 02:54:39.783]  I was almost killed a few years ago.
[02:54:39.823 --> 02:54:40.263]  Exactly.
[02:54:40.323 --> 02:54:42.564]  So what is the decisive action, Dr. Greer?
[02:54:43.237 --> 02:54:44.218]  What do we do?
[02:54:44.838 --> 02:54:50.442]  The decisive action is first understanding yourself and the power that you have within you.
[02:54:51.102 --> 02:54:55.045]  Secondly, learning what it is that they're really keeping secret.
[02:54:55.565 --> 02:54:59.588]  And the whole UFO issue is the crown jewel of a whole constellation of them.
[02:55:00.028 --> 02:55:03.951]  Free energy, new technologies, the existence of other civilizations.
[02:55:04.531 --> 02:55:06.693]  These are all a part and parcel.
[02:55:07.393 --> 02:55:12.497]  Then there's also the whole medical industrial complex, the military industrial complex.
[02:55:13.072 --> 02:55:24.245]  So all of that, you have to understand that that's part and parcel of a unified strategic effort by a global organization that is managed globally.
[02:55:24.346 --> 02:55:26.388]  It's transnational, such as U.S.
[02:55:26.789 --> 02:55:31.274]  It's a transnational group, not international like the U.N., but transnational.
[02:55:31.963 --> 02:55:36.086]  So I think that then you get into this whole question of, then what do we do?
[02:55:36.166 --> 02:55:41.349]  Well, we have to find the people who can be truth tellers and whistleblowers come forward.
[02:55:41.789 --> 02:55:56.179]  We need to bring these technologies out outside of government and large corrupt transnational corporations that can be used to liberate the planet from the grip of this entire petrodollar global elite system.
[02:55:56.958 --> 02:56:07.844]  And we also need to initiate contact with these civilizations peacefully and show that there are people on this planet that aren't just insane, psychopathic warmongers.
[02:56:08.244 --> 02:56:18.289]  Because, look, over the last 70 years since we detonated atomic and nuclear bombs, these civilizations have been very concerned about us going out into space and the threat we might pose.
[02:56:18.990 --> 02:56:23.492]  They have not had a rational response from humanity
[02:56:24.221 --> 02:56:27.486]  And that's why we have an app called CE5 Contact.
[02:56:28.147 --> 02:56:33.074]  And that app trains people that we know how to go out and make contact with these civilizations.
[02:56:33.154 --> 02:56:34.336]  And it works, by the way.
[02:56:35.037 --> 02:56:40.445]  And the reason that's important is that if enough people bypass the government and join together,
[02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:51.035]  The government, these corrupt interests in the government, these unacknowledged special access deep black projects, they're not going to have any power over the future.
[02:56:51.475 --> 02:56:53.897]  It's going to actually be taken back by the people.
[02:56:54.357 --> 02:57:02.322]  So that's why people need to view themselves as empowered and not sitting on the sidelines, you know, scared to death.
[02:57:02.902 --> 02:57:04.122]  Well, yeah, you say you've got an app.
[02:57:04.223 --> 02:57:08.944]  I literally, you know, I know God's really created the universe, and God's got all these angels, things that God's created.
[02:57:09.464 --> 02:57:15.146]  I literally reached out and literally said, show me, show me, because I want, and it was like, boom, I got shown it.
[02:57:15.266 --> 02:57:18.027]  I mean, it was like, it wasn't my brain creating this stuff.
[02:57:18.047 --> 02:57:22.809]  This stuff's never been seen by anybody other than I'm sure people that have had this experience and already have these experiences.
[02:57:22.849 --> 02:57:24.149]  How did I have dreams that come true?
[02:57:24.449 --> 02:57:25.450]  How did I know all this stuff?
[02:57:25.490 --> 02:57:28.311]  How did I, and it was all there, and it was exactly, you said,
[02:57:29.391 --> 02:57:29.712]  Yes.
[02:57:47.120 --> 02:57:49.884]  Uh, and an effort to do it, but it's not a great effort.
[02:57:50.405 --> 02:57:53.228]  It has to be you have to be open to it and pursue it.
[02:57:54.009 --> 02:57:56.652]  On the other hand, they're hoping people don't do that.
[02:57:56.712 --> 02:58:03.261]  And I think this is 1 of the problems where social media and all our digital electronic devices.
[02:58:03.921 --> 02:58:10.163]  It has turned people into increasingly passive people who watch but don't do.
[02:58:10.183 --> 02:58:20.966]  And I think we need to sort of free ourselves from that trap and begin to view ourselves as doers and not just people watching, you know, passively.
[02:58:20.986 --> 02:58:21.326]  Explain that.
[02:58:21.346 --> 02:58:24.987]  We need to stop being spectators but actors in the real stage.
[02:58:25.962 --> 02:58:26.442]  Exactly.
[02:58:26.483 --> 02:58:39.794]  And the only way to do that is to empower yourself and see yourself as actually someone who can effect change, who can become enlightened, who can take on these issues.
[02:58:40.434 --> 02:58:50.082]  And I honestly, I will tell you, a lot of people go, oh my God, you know, I had dinner with a medical colleague and friend last night, said, you know, nobody can figure out why you're not dead yet.
[02:58:50.563 --> 02:58:52.024]  And I said, yeah, I do.
[02:58:52.891 --> 02:58:53.432]  We know why.
[02:58:53.852 --> 02:59:03.180]  But I said it was still very daunting because, you know, honestly, I'm probably the enemy of the state on this thing, the biggest secret in the United States history.
[02:59:03.600 --> 02:59:15.030]  But I think that if I had not had that near-death experience and experienced that state of the infinite that's folded within us, that's the great peace within, there's no way I could have done that.
[02:59:15.471 --> 02:59:16.792]  And of course, my wife as well.
[02:59:16.832 --> 02:59:19.234]  I mean, my wife's really the power behind the throne.
[02:59:19.854 --> 02:59:20.155]  Yes, I agree.
[02:59:37.678 --> 02:59:46.244]  Yeah, and I think it's a sacred bond that people have amongst each other and family.
[02:59:46.264 --> 02:59:51.228]  We're expecting our 11th grandchild in a few weeks, about three weeks from now.
[02:59:51.949 --> 03:00:00.476]  And what I hope and pray is that we come together as a people and move forward with this experience together.
[03:00:01.317 --> 03:00:15.519]  And if we pursue the experience and speak the truth, but also that inner experiences where we get the the power within ourselves, frankly, to have the courage to take on.
[03:00:16.585 --> 03:00:21.630]  These rather intimidating forces, and you know, I'm not telling people this is a cakewalk.
[03:00:21.690 --> 03:00:27.235]  It's been a very daunting, difficult, death-defying experience for me and my family.
[03:00:27.755 --> 03:00:42.769]  But I think that if we understand that this is within us and our ability to do it, because we have this infinite source of power that is beyond our ego and individuality, and that's really what we have to hang on to.
[03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:51.334]  It's hanging on to the hem of the robe of God as we go forward doing things that have to be accomplished in this very short period.
[03:00:51.374 --> 03:00:56.657]  I mean, there's not, you know, look, we frittered away a hundred years where we could have resolved a lot of these problems, Alex.
[03:00:56.997 --> 03:00:59.159]  We don't have another hundred years to fritter away.
[03:00:59.479 --> 03:01:01.500]  This is all coming to a head, in my opinion.
[03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:02.080]  We don't, no.
[03:01:02.140 --> 03:01:07.644]  I think we all have to find our courage and our voice and march and do the right things together.
[03:01:08.624 --> 03:01:23.949]  You know, I love the end of, you know, when Colonel Corso, who had worked on the technology transfer from studying the extraterrestrial craft that had crashed at Roswell and other places, back in 56, he went out to the White Sands.
[03:01:23.969 --> 03:01:27.210]  There was an ET craft on radar that went and landed out there.
[03:01:27.970 --> 03:01:31.311]  And he drove out there in a Jeep and had this encounter with an ET.
[03:01:31.391 --> 03:01:33.592]  And at one point, he turns to the ET.
[03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:48.867]  The ET is asking him for his help in standing down some of these weapons systems and these atomic and thermonuclear systems that create a pulse that goes beyond the speed of light that damages their world, actually, not just this world.
[03:01:49.047 --> 03:01:53.110]  And Colonel Corso very brashly said, well, what's in it for me?
[03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:57.672]  And the ET looked at him and said, a new world, if you can take it.
[03:01:58.610 --> 03:02:04.272]  So there is a new world trying to be born and an old world trying to sort of recede.
[03:02:05.252 --> 03:02:14.435]  But the interesting comment was, if you can take it, you know, we have to now accept the responsibility of giving birth to that new time.
[03:02:15.115 --> 03:02:17.696]  And to do it, we have to sort of be aware.
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:24.603]  They're fascist interests, but not give them more power than they have.
[03:02:25.004 --> 03:02:45.762]  They have very little power compared to the collective of good people and the power of this infinite spirit and the agencies that are between heaven and earth, let's call it, including extraterrestrial civilizations that are very, very much interested in us making it through across this chasm.
[03:02:46.983 --> 03:02:49.324]  And I think that's what's very encouraging.
[03:02:49.644 --> 03:02:51.024]  I'm actually a big optimist.
[03:02:51.064 --> 03:02:55.405]  I think we have a rough ride ahead because this really should have been done 100 years ago.
[03:02:55.985 --> 03:02:59.206]  But that's, I wasn't around 100 years.
[03:02:59.246 --> 03:02:59.626]  You weren't.
[03:03:00.026 --> 03:03:00.706]  Now we're here.
[03:03:01.066 --> 03:03:02.986]  It's where the rubber is going to meet the road.
[03:03:03.146 --> 03:03:04.587]  We've got to get this right.
[03:03:05.307 --> 03:03:08.888]  And we don't have a lot of opportunities to mess it up now.
[03:03:09.468 --> 03:03:10.128]  All right, Dr. Greer.
[03:03:10.528 --> 03:03:11.108]  Beautifully said.
[03:03:11.128 --> 03:03:11.968]  We've got three minutes left.
[03:03:11.988 --> 03:03:13.429]  You've got to go with your family to dinner.
[03:03:13.729 --> 03:03:15.149]  We appreciate you here on Saturday with us.
[03:03:16.687 --> 03:03:21.852]  Pulling back, looking at Atlantis, Plato, everything he wrote turned out to be true except Atlantis.
[03:03:22.232 --> 03:03:26.256]  He said it was real flying machines, free power, blew up in the Atlantic Ocean, all that.
[03:03:26.576 --> 03:03:34.323]  But whether Atlantis is real or not, we've reached our Atlantean moment with nuclear weapons, hydrogen weapons, fish infusion, artificial black holes.
[03:03:34.644 --> 03:03:37.646]  That stuff's all 45 years old, 60 years old, or older.
[03:03:38.547 --> 03:03:41.070]  Max Planck's equations for 120-something years old.
[03:03:41.631 --> 03:03:48.478]  So, I think it comes down to, yes, only sentient peaceful beings can have this much power and technology.
[03:03:48.498 --> 03:03:55.025]  If we don't give up all this evil, we're gonna destroy ourselves and greedy people see that's coming and they want to try to steal it.
[03:03:55.586 --> 03:03:58.408]  And then not let us have it and kill us so they can control it.
[03:03:58.708 --> 03:03:59.849]  That's not going to work.
[03:03:59.869 --> 03:04:01.250]  They're people just like us.
[03:04:01.690 --> 03:04:02.471]  It's going to explode.
[03:04:02.531 --> 03:04:09.035]  So just in two minutes, closing comments and parallels between this moment and what I call Atlantis 2.
[03:04:09.535 --> 03:04:14.658]  I know that some of the founding fathers thought they were building the new Atlantis in America and that kind of got in the esoteric.
[03:04:14.698 --> 03:04:19.682]  But whether you believe in the old Atlantis or not for anybody, we are the new Atlantis in my view.
[03:04:19.962 --> 03:04:21.503]  Will we destroy ourselves is a question.
[03:04:23.018 --> 03:04:25.820]  Well, that's what hasn't played out yet.
[03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:29.942]  And I think that that's a matter of our collective choice together.
[03:04:30.503 --> 03:04:34.565]  And I think that it can go several different ways.
[03:04:35.586 --> 03:04:43.291]  We could reach a point where things go too far and we have a very big catastrophic series of events.
[03:04:44.211 --> 03:04:45.432]  But here's what I think.
[03:04:46.207 --> 03:04:52.129]  I don't think that even if that happens, it's the end of the old era and the beginning of the new.
[03:04:52.629 --> 03:04:59.292]  It would be better if we could create as soft a landing as possible and avoid the worst catastrophic events.
[03:05:00.252 --> 03:05:14.037]  But in the meanwhile, I tell people not to give power to the negative, but be focused on that far horizon of creating this new Atlantis, this new world, as this ET said to Colonel Corso.
[03:05:16.401 --> 03:05:16.995]  That is a-
[03:05:18.310 --> 03:05:24.593]  On a spiritual level, it's already in the Empyrean realm of ideas, as Plato talked about, ready to manifest.
[03:05:24.953 --> 03:05:31.896]  But we, children of Earth, have to be the agencies that are the primary movers to create it.
[03:05:32.336 --> 03:05:35.117]  So, I think that we are at exactly that moment.
[03:05:35.277 --> 03:05:36.838]  The world has gone this way before.
[03:05:36.878 --> 03:05:47.382]  And by the way, there's a man I work with who's under contract with the CIA, who is routinely given devices that are hundreds of thousands and millions of years old.
[03:05:47.982 --> 03:05:48.763]  Well, we know this.
[03:05:48.803 --> 03:05:53.185]  All the official stories we're given about dinosaur bones and T-Rex skeletons, I mean, and they claim it's this or that.
[03:05:53.265 --> 03:05:55.926]  I mean, obviously, none of that, none of that's accurate, right?
[03:05:56.327 --> 03:05:57.287]  I mean, who even knows?
[03:06:13.413 --> 03:06:20.217]  Well, certainly there have been civilizations on this planet before any record of what we have.
[03:06:20.678 --> 03:06:23.819]  And I think the question is, how far back does it go?
[03:06:24.820 --> 03:06:26.981]  Life on this planet, 700 million years.
[03:06:27.462 --> 03:06:30.944]  I think there have been entire civilizations that aren't homo sapien.
[03:06:31.621 --> 03:06:35.444]  That have been on this planet, that have been gone out and are gone.
[03:06:36.425 --> 03:06:45.773]  You know, the landing at Rendlesham Forest, the Bentwaters case in England in the early 80s, that was actually us from 500,000 years in the future.
[03:06:46.094 --> 03:06:53.100]  That black pyramid-shaped object that landed on that Air Force base, that we have all the landing trace and the reports from the Ministry of Defense.
[03:06:53.620 --> 03:06:58.605]  Those were us from the future coming back saying, don't go to this whole destructive
[03:06:59.305 --> 03:06:59.845]  We're good to go.
[03:07:19.614 --> 03:07:25.539]  All right, Dr. Stephen Greer, your new film for free is at Bandai Video, The Cosmic Hoax.
[03:07:25.719 --> 03:07:28.341]  And again, you've got a lot of great websites and books and material.
[03:07:28.401 --> 03:07:31.883]  What's the best site for folks to visit to find everything, Dr. Stephen Greer?
[03:07:33.324 --> 03:07:37.788]  The best site where everything is aggregated is seriousdisclosure.com.
[03:07:37.968 --> 03:07:39.129]  S-I-R-I-U-S.
[03:07:39.622 --> 03:07:40.782]  Disclosure.com.
[03:07:41.342 --> 03:07:42.823]  And we have a store there.
[03:07:42.923 --> 03:07:51.585]  We have five books that people can get, e-books, all kinds of DVDs as well, if you still use DVDs, and training materials.
[03:07:51.645 --> 03:07:54.006]  And then there's the CE5 Contact app.
[03:07:54.466 --> 03:08:07.550]  If you really want to learn about how to go out under the stars and have a great experience in meditative state and consciousness, CE5 Contact app is on the App Store for Android and Apple.
[03:08:08.478 --> 03:08:11.400]  And it's a great training tool for people.
[03:08:12.121 --> 03:08:15.283]  All right, Dr. Steven Greer, thank you so much and thanks for spending time with us on Saturday.
[03:08:16.143 --> 03:08:16.604]  Thank you.
[03:08:16.624 --> 03:08:17.664]  I appreciate your time.
[03:08:18.365 --> 03:08:19.345]  Well, that was powerful.
[03:08:19.886 --> 03:08:20.806]  Thank you, Dr. Greer.
[03:08:21.147 --> 03:08:29.772]  We're going to take a break and I'm going to come back and we're going to look at what's really in this so-called vaccine, ladies and gentlemen, from a researcher and whistleblower.
[03:08:30.132 --> 03:08:31.994]  We're not going to give you his name, but he's going to be joining us.
[03:08:32.294 --> 03:08:33.455]  He's got some powerful findings.
[03:08:33.475 --> 03:08:33.995]  Please stay with us.
[03:08:34.454 --> 03:08:37.476]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[03:08:37.737 --> 03:08:42.100]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:44.422]  All the tyranny we warned of is now here.
[03:08:45.042 --> 03:08:49.426]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[03:08:49.826 --> 03:08:53.589]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.

[03:09:41.921 --> 03:09:43.783]  We're making a documentary series together.
[03:09:44.703 --> 03:09:47.946]  He's got a lot of connections, let's just say, all over the place.
[03:09:48.527 --> 03:09:51.029]  And in the future, he'll reveal who he is.
[03:09:51.109 --> 03:09:56.233]  But he's got a lot of connections, not just in big tech, but also in the biomedical field.
[03:09:56.794 --> 03:09:58.895]  And most of this is open source information, but
[03:09:59.969 --> 03:10:02.250]  He was telling me so much important things last few weeks.
[03:10:02.290 --> 03:10:05.832]  I thought, why don't we twist his arm to come on the broadcast with us.
[03:10:06.392 --> 03:10:13.695]  So Liberty Man information presentation starts right now on this special Saturday transmission.
[03:10:13.715 --> 03:10:15.756]  So, you know, I'll interrupt Liberty Man.
[03:10:15.796 --> 03:10:17.357]  I'm a man of many words.
[03:10:17.797 --> 03:10:28.182]  So just get into how you woke up, what you're witnessing, what's happening and what we're now learning about why they really are working so hard to force this stuff into our bodies.
[03:10:30.540 --> 03:10:31.120]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:31.940]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:10:33.721 --> 03:10:44.664]  Well, let me first say that I was thinking about, I'm really glad actually right now that I'm not revealing my identity because this is not about who I am, my background, my expertise, my credentials, anything.
[03:10:45.085 --> 03:10:47.505]  There's no appeal to authority or appeal to emotion here.
[03:10:48.346 --> 03:10:57.288]  What you need to do, everybody that's listening, and particularly lawyers, doctors, scientists, you need to just go and look at the information that we're going to hit on today.
[03:10:57.909 --> 03:10:59.209]  You need to go see it for yourself.
[03:10:59.824 --> 03:11:04.065]  We need to get past the compartmentalization where people say, well, I'm only trained in this or trained in that.
[03:11:04.385 --> 03:11:06.966]  The reality is they're deploying technology on us.
[03:11:07.546 --> 03:11:12.648]  And if you don't understand that technology, you will not understand what's going on.
[03:11:12.888 --> 03:11:18.209]  If you're a politician, if you don't understand the DARPA technology that's being deployed on us right now, you are unfit to govern.
[03:11:18.549 --> 03:11:18.809]  Okay?
[03:11:19.309 --> 03:11:24.111]  So we are going to be digging in to basically what I think is the Rosetta Stone.
[03:11:24.251 --> 03:11:28.472]  And when I say the Rosetta Stone, it's going to give you the perspective on
[03:11:29.318 --> 03:11:39.842]  Why they're pushing this stuff so hard for the doctors and the scientists out there, you're going to be able to better understand all the adverse events, all the vaccine injury that's going on right now.
[03:11:39.862 --> 03:11:40.582]  Okay.
[03:11:41.203 --> 03:11:49.045]  But more importantly, you're going to understand two key things of the agenda, why they're pushing so hard, what this means to them.
[03:11:49.486 --> 03:11:49.786]  Okay.
[03:11:50.486 --> 03:11:55.628]  So if we can just jump into it, I mean, this is kind of, I'll tell a little bit of backstory to set some context here.
[03:11:56.636 --> 03:12:00.737]  Working with Alex, we're making an Infowars original series documentary.
[03:12:00.938 --> 03:12:01.258]  Okay.
[03:12:02.138 --> 03:12:05.059]  And it's about all the crazy stuff going on.
[03:12:05.239 --> 03:12:05.439]  Right.
[03:12:06.219 --> 03:12:09.781]  And I've, I've gotten in touch with some biotech people, executive level.
[03:12:10.461 --> 03:12:15.062]  And they started, uh, over a month ago, started saying, pointing me in a certain direction.
[03:12:16.663 --> 03:12:19.724]  And what they're saying is this thing is a witch's brew.
[03:12:20.344 --> 03:12:21.865]  There's more than one thing going on.
[03:12:22.265 --> 03:12:22.505]  Okay.
[03:12:23.786 --> 03:12:26.648]  And in particular, you need to look at graphene and graphene oxide.
[03:12:28.349 --> 03:12:29.150]  And I'd heard about it.
[03:12:29.170 --> 03:12:35.394]  I saw some like Health Canada news from six months ago that said there was graphene in the face masks and they recalled a bunch of the masks.
[03:12:35.434 --> 03:12:37.255]  And then a couple of weeks ago, they said, no, it's okay.
[03:12:37.315 --> 03:12:38.155]  The graphene's in there.
[03:12:38.256 --> 03:12:38.796]  No problem.
[03:12:39.576 --> 03:12:39.837]  All right.
[03:12:41.358 --> 03:12:41.898]  But guess what?
[03:12:42.758 --> 03:12:43.819]  It didn't really sink into me.
[03:12:43.839 --> 03:12:45.520]  And I started looking into it, but it didn't sink in.
[03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:51.404]  And then we saw a Spanish team, Stu Peters and Dr. Jane Ruby covered this about three weeks ago.
[03:12:52.005 --> 03:12:52.625]  Spanish team.
[03:12:54.005 --> 03:12:58.610]  They've tested some of the vials and found they're like 98 to 99% graphene oxide.
[03:12:59.170 --> 03:13:02.193]  This is not a listed excipient on the ingredients list, right?
[03:13:02.213 --> 03:13:03.595]  For these vaccines.
[03:13:04.113 --> 03:13:04.753]  I'll explain that.
[03:13:04.793 --> 03:13:08.616]  I'll explain how you can trace the excipients they do disclose to graphene oxide.
[03:13:08.776 --> 03:13:10.137]  We're going to cover that.
[03:13:10.177 --> 03:13:17.981]  Start rolling through it because we even have major whistleblowers from Pfizer talking about the graphene oxide and how it's just an adjuvant.
[03:13:19.242 --> 03:13:21.424]  It's a thing to track nanotech.
[03:13:21.804 --> 03:13:24.625]  I mean, this is clearly marking us that there's no doubt about it.
[03:13:25.786 --> 03:13:26.206]  That's right.
[03:13:26.727 --> 03:13:27.087]  That's right.
[03:13:27.127 --> 03:13:28.508]  Karen Kingston did a great job.
[03:13:28.748 --> 03:13:29.048]  Okay.
[03:13:29.188 --> 03:13:31.269]  I'm going to build a little bit further on what she showed us.
[03:13:31.450 --> 03:13:31.650]  Right.
[03:13:34.649 --> 03:13:40.498]  But we're going to basically set a higher level context, which is to understand these shots.
[03:13:40.538 --> 03:13:45.184]  You have to understand that there are two parallel revolutions at play from a technology perspective.
[03:13:45.205 --> 03:13:49.431]  There's a biotech side to it, and there's a nanotech side to it.
[03:13:50.112 --> 03:13:50.392]  All right.
[03:13:50.939 --> 03:13:58.440]  And the community, the research community, the alternative media community, we're not wrong about the antibody dependency enhancement.
[03:13:58.460 --> 03:13:59.100]  I don't think we are.
[03:13:59.140 --> 03:13:59.961]  We're starting to see it.
[03:14:00.341 --> 03:14:01.401]  The pathogenic priming.
[03:14:01.841 --> 03:14:02.981]  Everybody's focused on that.
[03:14:03.181 --> 03:14:06.862]  And that comes from the mRNA gene therapy biotech side of this.
[03:14:08.222 --> 03:14:14.183]  What we're not focused on is the graphene, graphene oxide, which is the nanotech side.
[03:14:14.583 --> 03:14:18.404]  So let's get into this a little bit here then, because basically,
[03:14:18.934 --> 03:14:21.356]  You know, let's, you know, what is graphene oxide?
[03:14:22.397 --> 03:14:26.480]  It's the only single layer atomic structure known to man.
[03:14:27.220 --> 03:14:32.464]  It's also the most thermal and electroconductive substance known to man.
[03:14:33.985 --> 03:14:35.306]  You look at where it gets applied.
[03:14:35.667 --> 03:14:36.187]  It's crazy.
[03:14:36.547 --> 03:14:41.071]  Digital displays, batteries, transistors, antennas, solar cells, energy generation.
[03:14:42.492 --> 03:14:43.392]  Here's where it gets creepy.
[03:14:43.913 --> 03:14:48.296]  Go look at all the use cases and applications as it relates to health.
[03:14:49.554 --> 03:14:49.934]  Medical.
[03:14:52.215 --> 03:14:53.235]  DNA sequencing.
[03:14:53.375 --> 03:14:54.216]  Water filtration.
[03:14:54.296 --> 03:14:55.096]  Drug delivery.
[03:14:55.736 --> 03:14:56.497]  PPE.
[03:14:58.037 --> 03:15:00.358]  Okay?
[03:15:00.458 --> 03:15:01.258]  It's quite incredible.
[03:15:02.279 --> 03:15:07.161]  And basically, if you look at Pfizer and Moderna, they disclose that there's these nanolipids.
[03:15:08.341 --> 03:15:10.482]  Now we know the mRNA is very fragile.
[03:15:11.422 --> 03:15:12.543]  So they have this hydrogel.
[03:15:13.423 --> 03:15:15.544]  They basically create like a synthetic cell.
[03:15:16.264 --> 03:15:16.504]  Okay?
[03:15:16.988 --> 03:15:17.828]  You have to ask your question.
[03:15:18.148 --> 03:15:19.169]  It's just all of this is out.
[03:15:19.329 --> 03:15:20.029]  It's right in our face.
[03:15:20.089 --> 03:15:20.689]  It's under our nose.
[03:15:20.930 --> 03:15:31.954]  How does the mRNA that's in that hydrogel, how does it basically get into, you know, deliver that mRNA payload into our cells?
[03:15:32.914 --> 03:15:34.155]  The answer is graphene oxide.
[03:15:34.815 --> 03:15:35.035]  Okay.
[03:15:35.815 --> 03:15:44.459]  And we know that through these biodistribution studies and what we're seeing with our own eyes is when people are getting injected with this stuff, it's not staying at the injection site like they said it would.
[03:15:44.979 --> 03:15:45.119]  Right.
[03:15:45.475 --> 03:15:45.975]  We know that.
[03:15:46.115 --> 03:15:48.257]  We know the synthetic spikes going all over the place.
[03:15:48.357 --> 03:15:51.098]  On the record, it focuses on the brain, heart, and lungs.
[03:15:52.339 --> 03:15:52.759]  That's right.
[03:15:53.239 --> 03:15:57.262]  And when you dig into the scientific literature on graphene oxide, it's all over.
[03:15:57.282 --> 03:15:59.603]  Hey, it can pass through the blood-brain barrier.
[03:16:00.203 --> 03:16:00.904]  Isn't that great?
[03:16:01.384 --> 03:16:05.206]  And this is where you get into brain-chip interfaces like in-brain technologies and Neuralink.
[03:16:05.746 --> 03:16:06.006]  Okay?
[03:16:06.467 --> 03:16:08.928]  It's part, it's con, it's very important conduit.
[03:16:09.292 --> 03:16:12.133]  For these assemblers to, to be able to function, they need it.
[03:16:12.153 --> 03:16:15.634]  You're going to get, you're doing a great job, but basically they're creating the interface.
[03:16:16.054 --> 03:16:17.795]  The plug is being put in us right now.
[03:16:18.935 --> 03:16:19.375]  You got it.
[03:16:19.576 --> 03:16:20.876]  This is part of the smart grid.
[03:16:22.777 --> 03:16:23.857]  It's part of the smart cities.
[03:16:26.438 --> 03:16:26.798]  That's right.
[03:16:26.818 --> 03:16:33.060]  Now let's get, so the, the, what, what Karen Kingston, uh, talked about.
[03:16:33.500 --> 03:16:34.821]  Well, she's, she did a good job.
[03:16:34.841 --> 03:16:38.382]  She said, Hey, look, you can look at the excipients that they're disclosing.
[03:16:39.898 --> 03:16:43.721]  And in that lipid, that nanolipid particle, okay?
[03:16:45.122 --> 03:16:46.843]  It has one in there that says PEG.
[03:16:47.224 --> 03:16:47.664]  What's PEG?
[03:16:47.704 --> 03:16:48.845]  It's polyethylene glycol.
[03:16:49.165 --> 03:16:49.545]  What's that?
[03:16:50.066 --> 03:16:54.089]  It's a petroleum-based substance.
[03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.569]  Okay?
[03:16:54.609 --> 03:16:55.510]  It's petroleum-based.
[03:16:56.470 --> 03:16:57.251]  Now here's the kicker.
[03:16:57.791 --> 03:17:04.416]  You can go pull up studies about how they can graft graphene oxide to polyethylene glycol.
[03:17:06.938 --> 03:17:07.699]  They can graft it.
[03:17:08.259 --> 03:17:08.479]  Okay?
[03:17:10.518 --> 03:17:14.140]  Once you understand that, then it puts a whole other perspective on this.
[03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:19.964]  And there are patents, by the way, even about just graphene oxide being used in coronavirus vaccines.
[03:17:20.044 --> 03:17:23.986]  There's a Chinese nanotech institute or something, I think, out of Shanghai.
[03:17:24.206 --> 03:17:29.490]  And they're not denying that they've got this oil that they're putting the RNA in.
[03:17:30.930 --> 03:17:31.611]  They don't deny that.
[03:17:31.651 --> 03:17:32.391]  So, Alex, that's right.
[03:17:32.411 --> 03:17:35.173]  But that oil, there's cholesterol as part of it.
[03:17:35.492 --> 03:17:40.275]  That oil is a synthetic cell structure to preserve the mRNA.
[03:17:41.075 --> 03:17:54.804]  But the delivery mechanism, the part that's in charge of doing the biodistribution, getting that all throughout your body, and then attaching to a cell, and then having an insertion to crack the cell line wall to deliver the mRNA payload, that's graphene oxide.
[03:17:56.465 --> 03:17:59.727]  Now, here's how they get away with not listing graphene oxide.
[03:18:02.113 --> 03:18:03.575]  This is so important.
[03:18:03.995 --> 03:18:13.223]  So you've got this oil, this lipid that's got the RNA in it, but then it needs the graphene oxide to punch through the cell membrane and get it in.
[03:18:13.283 --> 03:18:14.124]  Okay, now go ahead.
[03:18:15.165 --> 03:18:15.545]  That's right.
[03:18:16.226 --> 03:18:17.346]  But it does a lot more than that.
[03:18:18.027 --> 03:18:19.068]  It does a lot more than that.
[03:18:19.548 --> 03:18:28.376]  Now, another interesting angle to understand the relationship with PEG is you go research, go read up all the toxicity studies of graphene oxide.
[03:18:29.284 --> 03:18:33.447]  So graphene showed up on the scene in nanotech research in 2010.
[03:18:33.847 --> 03:18:37.249]  And you've got a ton of toxicity studies, 2010, 2011.
[03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:41.252]  We'll get to some of the stuff that it does, okay, that you can see in those studies.
[03:18:42.292 --> 03:18:45.534]  But basically, they show that, oh, it's really toxic.
[03:18:46.175 --> 03:18:49.957]  I mean, it does a lot of damage to your blood and other things.
[03:18:50.017 --> 03:18:54.300]  So we can put different types of coatings on it to reduce its toxicity profile.
[03:18:54.844 --> 03:18:59.488]  Well, PEG, polyethylene glycol, is one of those coatings that helps to reduce its toxicity.
[03:18:59.808 --> 03:19:09.336]  But as we can see with the disclosed excipients, is that it also serves as cover, as a decoy, so that you can basically piggyback it in.
[03:19:09.536 --> 03:19:11.197]  They're telling you, hey, here's the coating.
[03:19:11.558 --> 03:19:13.339]  They're not telling you what it's a coating for.
[03:19:13.919 --> 03:19:20.625]  So on that basis alone, I think every lawyer should be going, we don't have, how can you have informed consent when that's going on?
[03:19:22.654 --> 03:19:23.334]  Well, that's right.
[03:19:23.474 --> 03:19:32.278]  And again, if something can stealthily get into the body, it's getting around the body's defenses and they claim, oh, well, it's not delivering its payload.
[03:19:32.358 --> 03:19:34.178]  It's not it's not toxifying the body.
[03:19:34.499 --> 03:19:36.219]  Well, what about where it ends up, though?
[03:19:36.259 --> 03:19:38.000]  Then it is delivering something toxic.
[03:19:39.704 --> 03:19:44.565]  Well, I mean, after it delivers something, it's like your body will eventually get rid of this.
[03:19:44.745 --> 03:19:49.346]  And if you have high glutathione levels, the research is showing that you'll eventually expel it.
[03:19:49.607 --> 03:19:50.767]  And I believe, you know, we'll get into this.
[03:19:50.907 --> 03:19:51.967]  This is why they want boosters.
[03:19:52.447 --> 03:19:52.727]  Okay.
[03:19:53.067 --> 03:19:58.449]  This is also why... Oh, so yeah, because they want to... Gates said over a year ago, we've got to have boosters.
[03:19:58.489 --> 03:19:59.669]  Now they're acting like that's a new thing.
[03:20:01.169 --> 03:20:03.230]  They got to keep your smart dust levels up, Alex.
[03:20:03.982 --> 03:20:05.283]  And then, you know, think this too.
[03:20:05.504 --> 03:20:06.885]  You know how they're getting rid of the PCR?
[03:20:06.905 --> 03:20:07.546]  How they made it?
[03:20:07.566 --> 03:20:09.367]  I can't really tell the difference between influenza.
[03:20:09.387 --> 03:20:11.069]  We're not going to extend the EUA for it.
[03:20:11.129 --> 03:20:12.330]  You're like, well, what are you going to test us with?
[03:20:12.350 --> 03:20:14.452]  Because we know testing is a big thing and it's not going away.
[03:20:15.233 --> 03:20:22.721]  Well, one of the one of the functionalities of graphene oxide in your body is to serve as a biosensor.
[03:20:23.461 --> 03:20:27.826]  So how much do you want to bet that they're going to do readouts of your GO levels?
[03:20:28.726 --> 03:20:33.409]  And go, oh, yeah, actually, we're not getting a really high resolution readout here on your graphene oxide levels.
[03:20:33.629 --> 03:20:34.449]  You need a booster.
[03:20:35.170 --> 03:20:41.033]  And I'm sure you saw where Bill Gates and George Soros are coming out with new testing companies.
[03:20:43.354 --> 03:20:45.936]  Yes, I think MoLogic.
[03:20:47.037 --> 03:20:47.957]  Well, you're making great points.
[03:20:48.097 --> 03:20:49.318]  I'm going to shut up.
[03:20:49.338 --> 03:20:49.818]  Keep going here.
[03:20:49.858 --> 03:20:50.539]  This is riveting.
[03:20:52.520 --> 03:20:54.181]  We're getting to the real crazy stuff, Alex.
[03:20:54.301 --> 03:20:58.123]  This is all, this is all, you know, it's amazing.
[03:20:59.332 --> 03:21:01.373]  This is all out in our face.
[03:21:01.413 --> 03:21:11.620]  And this is what the science, one of the science friends told me, you know, and one thing that they said, they said, I think people like me are going to be hunted in the years ahead.
[03:21:11.860 --> 03:21:19.425]  When everyone finds out we've done the hair on my arms stood up and they said, it's all out in the open.
[03:21:19.445 --> 03:21:20.986]  It's all out in the open.
[03:21:21.286 --> 03:21:21.666]  And it is.
[03:21:22.447 --> 03:21:24.328]  So let's keep going really quick.
[03:21:24.741 --> 03:21:26.402]  This is so secretive, and I'll tell you why.
[03:21:26.422 --> 03:21:32.043]  Because you can look, there are people filing Freedom of Information Acts, because they're going and saying, hey, the pegylated lipid... Oh, explain it.
[03:21:32.083 --> 03:21:34.044]  This is huge, breaking, exclusive info.
[03:21:34.124 --> 03:21:34.924]  I can confirm it all.
[03:21:35.304 --> 03:21:37.165]  This is earth-shattering stuff.
[03:21:37.185 --> 03:21:37.545]  Keep going.
[03:21:38.945 --> 03:21:41.726]  The pegylated lipid, the stuff that Karen Kaysen was showing us.
[03:21:41.766 --> 03:21:44.727]  Hey, this is where you've got to go look to make the correlation to graphene oxide.
[03:21:44.747 --> 03:21:45.407]  She's absolutely right.
[03:21:48.328 --> 03:21:49.748]  People filing FOIA requests.
[03:21:51.069 --> 03:21:51.809]  And guess what?
[03:21:52.674 --> 03:21:55.015]  The response is proprietary and confidential.
[03:21:56.215 --> 03:21:57.195]  We're not going to disclose anything.
[03:21:57.435 --> 03:22:07.178]  Now, this is amazing because normally when there's a novel excipient, a new ingredient introduced, the regulatory bodies make the companies put all sorts of information out.
[03:22:07.218 --> 03:22:10.498]  You've got to disclose tons and tons of things about a novel excipient.
[03:22:10.838 --> 03:22:12.239]  But why not graphene oxide?
[03:22:12.479 --> 03:22:14.079]  Why is it proprietary and confidential?
[03:22:14.299 --> 03:22:15.800]  And there's basically no disclosure.
[03:22:15.880 --> 03:22:16.880]  They're trying to cover it up.
[03:22:16.900 --> 03:22:17.640]  They're trying to hide it.
[03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:18.760]  Think about that.
[03:22:20.181 --> 03:22:20.921]  It was so good.
[03:22:22.410 --> 03:22:22.610]  Right?
[03:22:23.671 --> 03:22:23.851]  Alright.
[03:22:23.931 --> 03:22:29.412]  It's an experimental injection and they won't let you know what the ingredients do or even what's happening.
[03:22:29.432 --> 03:22:30.493]  Yeah, that's a nightmare.
[03:22:31.753 --> 03:22:31.993]  It is.
[03:22:32.793 --> 03:22:34.234]  Listen to the toxicity, okay?
[03:22:34.454 --> 03:22:35.374]  The toxicity.
[03:22:35.634 --> 03:22:38.475]  You look at the toxicity studies and it's unbelievable.
[03:22:39.135 --> 03:22:42.957]  Hold on.
[03:22:43.097 --> 03:22:44.077]  Toxicity studies.
[03:22:44.317 --> 03:22:50.079]  I found some that even talk about graphene oxide creates quote-unquote a biomolecular corona.
[03:22:51.058 --> 03:22:52.839]  What is a biomolecular corona?
[03:22:53.859 --> 03:22:54.339]  Isn't it funny?
[03:22:54.379 --> 03:22:55.419]  Corona is in the name of that.
[03:22:55.479 --> 03:22:56.080]  Like, come on.
[03:22:56.640 --> 03:22:57.480]  It's right there.
[03:22:57.840 --> 03:23:01.441]  But platelet aggregation, pulmonary embolism.
[03:23:01.761 --> 03:23:08.383]  In one study, they reported that nearly half of the lung vessels were totally or partially obstructed by platelet thrombosis.
[03:23:09.504 --> 03:23:15.766]  At the same time that they're sitting here saying, hey, this is actually going to totally or partially obstruct lung vessels.
[03:23:16.086 --> 03:23:16.646]  They also say,
[03:23:17.438 --> 03:23:24.001]  Oh, in another study, graphene oxide accumulation in lungs can be exploited for the passive pulmonary delivery of pharmaceuticals.
[03:23:25.661 --> 03:23:26.302]  Drug delivery.
[03:23:26.502 --> 03:23:29.163]  It's one of their key use cases.
[03:23:29.423 --> 03:23:37.286]  And now we got Kathy Griffin, who got cancer in the lungs right after she took the shot, and I confirmed it, and I'll leave it at that.
[03:23:37.846 --> 03:23:42.028]  Andrew Dice Clay got a serious neurological disorder after his injection.
[03:23:45.816 --> 03:23:48.737]  We're going to get to the neurological stuff, the neurological disorders.
[03:23:48.757 --> 03:23:49.397]  They know what's coming.
[03:23:49.817 --> 03:23:50.878]  I got proof they know what's coming.
[03:23:53.939 --> 03:23:57.940]  Well, the SPARS pandemic document, Chapter 17, Vaccine Injury.
[03:23:58.780 --> 03:24:02.281]  In their little war game scenario, it says, Hey, we're on 12 months after the shot.
[03:24:02.341 --> 03:24:08.343]  Everyone's, you know, all these mad, you know, prion disease, mad cow neurological diseases started showing up.
[03:24:09.123 --> 03:24:12.764]  And they said the solution was, well, the government's had to put in compensation funds.
[03:24:12.784 --> 03:24:13.144]  That's all.
[03:24:14.785 --> 03:24:15.045]  Anyway.
[03:24:17.503 --> 03:24:18.984]  Do you remember not too long ago?
[03:24:19.004 --> 03:24:21.506]  I mean, this has gone viral around the world, right?
[03:24:21.526 --> 03:24:26.910]  We've all seen these weird little nano worms in the face mask that was starting to pop up and go viral back in March.
[03:24:27.230 --> 03:24:30.032]  We've seen people put magnets on their arms.
[03:24:30.932 --> 03:24:33.154]  And we've kind of just turned a bit of a blind eye to it going.
[03:24:33.174 --> 03:24:34.335]  This is too sensational.
[03:24:34.415 --> 03:24:35.356]  I mean, am I trying?
[03:24:35.376 --> 03:24:37.177]  Am I someone trying to do me here?
[03:24:37.197 --> 03:24:38.658]  Right.
[03:24:39.118 --> 03:24:41.600]  It's very disturbing stuff.
[03:24:42.181 --> 03:24:45.523]  And what you're looking at and the answer to that magnetism in your arm.
[03:24:46.084 --> 03:24:52.369]  The answer to these weird little nanoworms in the PPE and the swabs and in the face masks, you're looking at graphene oxide.
[03:24:52.409 --> 03:24:54.251]  It's functionalized graphene oxide.
[03:24:54.271 --> 03:24:54.871]  Okay?
[03:24:56.793 --> 03:24:58.975]  All right, let's shift gears to the big picture stuff, Alex.
[03:25:01.937 --> 03:25:07.762]  I mentioned that we've got this biotech and the nanotech revolutions occurring in parallel.
[03:25:07.782 --> 03:25:12.786]  One of the things that really hit me like a ton of bricks was
[03:25:14.028 --> 03:25:16.189]  That helped put this all together for me, okay?
[03:25:16.509 --> 03:25:20.811]  Because I went back to Ray Kurzweil's book from 2005, Singularity is Near.
[03:25:20.831 --> 03:25:25.993]  And I remember reading this before and I was like, nah, this is kind of like Michio Kaku crazy talk, you know?
[03:25:26.533 --> 03:25:27.594]  This is way out there stuff.
[03:25:28.094 --> 03:25:28.654]  Can't prove it.
[03:25:28.674 --> 03:25:31.595]  And I thought, I don't know, is this guy just dreaming stuff up?
[03:25:31.635 --> 03:25:32.456]  How much of this is real?
[03:25:32.476 --> 03:25:38.078]  And you go back and in particular, you read chapter five, which is the three overlapping revolutions.
[03:25:39.118 --> 03:25:41.119]  Genetics, nanotech, and robotics.
[03:25:41.159 --> 03:25:43.140]  And you read that chapter and you were like,
[03:25:43.720 --> 03:25:47.003]  Back in 2005, man, this guy roadmapped it out.
[03:25:47.303 --> 03:25:47.543]  Okay?
[03:25:47.763 --> 03:25:49.505]  So we like to get really angry with Bill Gates.
[03:25:49.585 --> 03:25:51.747]  I'd say Bill Gates is the program manager for all this.
[03:25:52.527 --> 03:25:55.630]  I'd look to Ray Kurzweil to go, this guy's the technical product manager.
[03:25:56.811 --> 03:25:58.452]  He's the guy in charge of the roadmap here.
[03:25:58.893 --> 03:26:02.275]  He's down in the weeds, running those scientists a lot more than Bill Gates.
[03:26:02.315 --> 03:26:06.719]  Bill Gates is more about funding and, you know, being out front in the media and all that stuff.
[03:26:06.919 --> 03:26:12.664]  Product promotion, talking with CIA assets like Anderson Cooper on a weekly basis.
[03:26:13.470 --> 03:26:14.391]  Anyway, listen to this.
[03:26:14.431 --> 03:26:19.174]  This is a couple things coming out of that Ray Kurzweil's book that helped give us some really interesting perspective.
[03:26:19.954 --> 03:26:22.656]  Because again, why are they pushing so hard on all this stuff?
[03:26:25.418 --> 03:26:33.803]  He says, as important as the biotechnology revolution is, once its methods are fully mature, limits will be encountered in biology itself.
[03:26:34.644 --> 03:26:40.768]  So, you know, Dr. Robert Malone, all your mRNA gene therapy stuff, it's really cool and everything, but you're going to hit limits.
[03:26:40.848 --> 03:26:41.068]  Why?
[03:26:41.668 --> 03:26:42.969]  Because you're tinkering with
[03:26:43.524 --> 03:26:43.744]  All right.
[03:27:08.919 --> 03:27:15.484]  So he basically says, although biological systems are remarkable in their cleverness, we have also discovered that they are dramatically suboptimal.
[03:27:16.645 --> 03:27:22.869]  Biology will never be able to match what we will be capable of engineering once we fully understand biology's principles.
[03:27:22.889 --> 03:27:25.091]  Translated, biology's not turning itself over to us.
[03:27:26.612 --> 03:27:27.032]  You got it.
[03:27:27.773 --> 03:27:37.500]  He says, the revolution in nanotechnology, however, will ultimately enable us to redesign and rebuild, molecule by molecule, our bodies and brains and the world in which we interact
[03:27:37.912 --> 03:27:44.616]  These two revolutions are overlapping, but the full realization of nanotechnology lags behind the biotech revolution by about a decade.
[03:27:45.276 --> 03:27:48.278]  He says, profound implications of engineering machines.
[03:27:48.919 --> 03:27:50.820]  Sorry, actually, this goes back, by the way.
[03:27:51.620 --> 03:27:57.584]  When you think about Manhattan Project, this is a new Manhattan Project that we're going through right now.
[03:27:57.624 --> 03:28:00.686]  It's a big government worldwide democide operation.
[03:28:00.706 --> 03:28:01.226]  Oh, exactly.
[03:28:01.306 --> 03:28:05.969]  And I would say it's a thousand times bigger if they're successful than the Manhattan Project.
[03:28:07.205 --> 03:28:07.485]  It is.
[03:28:07.805 --> 03:28:09.426]  But you look at the Manhattan Project, right?
[03:28:09.466 --> 03:28:13.109]  And you know that, hey, 100,000 people worked on it.
[03:28:14.049 --> 03:28:17.151]  And maybe a few dozen people actually knew what it was all about.
[03:28:18.152 --> 03:28:18.652]  Right, Alex?
[03:28:18.752 --> 03:28:19.153]  You know that?
[03:28:19.353 --> 03:28:20.754]  Perfect compartmentalization.
[03:28:20.794 --> 03:28:20.974]  Yep.
[03:28:22.155 --> 03:28:23.375]  That's exactly what's going on now.
[03:28:23.415 --> 03:28:23.916]  But guess what?
[03:28:24.016 --> 03:28:29.299]  In the 50s, these guys had all planned out this molecular biology revolution.
[03:28:29.559 --> 03:28:30.020]  They had it.
[03:28:30.500 --> 03:28:35.483]  Basically, in the 1950s, they theorized all this stuff and went to work on it.
[03:28:35.981 --> 03:28:41.744]  They basically said back in the 50s that there are profound implications of engineering machines at the level of atoms.
[03:28:42.864 --> 03:28:48.066]  So, this is again from 2005, okay?
[03:28:48.427 --> 03:28:54.609]  Ray Kurzweil says, there's a hybrid scenario of biotech and nanotech and we're going to turn our biological cells into computers.
[03:28:54.909 --> 03:29:00.912]  These enhanced intelligent cells can then detect and destroy cancer cells and pathogens and even regrow human body parts.
[03:29:01.492 --> 03:29:04.894]  But really what they're doing is putting the sensors in to control our cells.
[03:29:07.109 --> 03:29:08.210]  Uh, that's part of it, Alex.
[03:29:08.230 --> 03:29:09.671]  That's just one of the many use cases.
[03:29:09.751 --> 03:29:10.632]  I kid you not.
[03:29:11.813 --> 03:29:12.013]  Yeah.
[03:29:12.073 --> 03:29:16.477]  I mean, it's, it's more than that because it's not just, biosensors is like reading.
[03:29:16.737 --> 03:29:21.181]  It's reading out what's going on in your cellular biology, but there's a whole right component.
[03:29:21.221 --> 03:29:21.921]  Like, listen to this.
[03:29:21.941 --> 03:29:23.062]  This is back in 2005.
[03:29:23.763 --> 03:29:30.629]  Princeton biochemist Ron Weiss has modified cells to incorporate a variety of logic functions that are used for basic computation.
[03:29:31.249 --> 03:29:34.792]  Boston University's Timothy Gardner has developed a cellular logic switch
[03:29:35.168 --> 03:29:35.408]  I think?
[03:29:58.331 --> 03:30:00.393]  Transhumanism, guys, this is it.
[03:30:00.613 --> 03:30:04.876]  The elites, we know, they have this singularity planned out.
[03:30:04.916 --> 03:30:05.697]  They want to live forever.
[03:30:05.737 --> 03:30:06.438]  They want to hack.
[03:30:07.058 --> 03:30:09.040]  They want to transcend their biological limits, okay?
[03:30:09.400 --> 03:30:17.066]  Now, all the evidence says, hey, they've been doing the testing on plants the last decade, and plant testing on animals, and testing on people that are modified.
[03:30:17.086 --> 03:30:17.707]  That's not good enough.
[03:30:17.727 --> 03:30:19.128]  They've got to do it on billions now.
[03:30:20.350 --> 03:30:27.704]  They gotta have real live data sets, large scale data sets, because when they go to use these technologies, they can't have toxicity profiles.
[03:30:27.744 --> 03:30:29.166]  They have to be perfect.
[03:30:29.567 --> 03:30:31.090]  They are trying to refine their methods.
[03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:32.472]  Because this is being done for them!
[03:30:33.922 --> 03:30:34.323]  You got it.
[03:30:52.526 --> 03:31:03.290]  You know, my dad got recruited in high school to a secret project and he got out of it in college, but it was injecting people to death, basically, in MD Anderson in secret cancer research.
[03:31:03.330 --> 03:31:05.691]  That was when he was like 15, 16 years old.
[03:31:06.151 --> 03:31:08.912]  And at the end they said, we were just seeing David if you'd be part of this.
[03:31:09.732 --> 03:31:12.594]  And he'd said no, so then they tried to put him in another project later.
[03:31:12.654 --> 03:31:21.577]  But that's all that is, injecting dogs with maggots and watching them eaten to death and injecting old people with stuff that kills them in two hours, radioactive isotopes.
[03:31:22.062 --> 03:31:24.944]  And that's all these tests are either, just to see if you'll do it.
[03:31:25.264 --> 03:31:25.944]  Please continue.
[03:31:27.845 --> 03:31:28.346]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:31:28.906 --> 03:31:38.031]  Okay, another big facet to this, guys, it's what we all know about, you know, UN Agenda 2030, smart grids, smart cities, sustainable development.
[03:31:38.511 --> 03:31:44.115]  So, I mean, graphing gets into 3D printed materials, and they think there's going to be abundance of all supplies and all this kind of stuff.
[03:31:44.155 --> 03:31:49.738]  But listen, when you look at Bill Gates' patent, that 060606 that has you mining for cryptocurrency,
[03:31:50.199 --> 03:31:53.643]  While you're loaded up with biosensors, that's likely graphene oxide, okay?
[03:31:54.024 --> 03:31:57.528]  They want to make you part of the infrastructure, the smart cities.
[03:31:58.088 --> 03:32:01.352]  You get into some of the control aspects of graphene oxide.
[03:32:01.693 --> 03:32:08.481]  Well, it can create artificial skin, but it's also human motion monitoring, human machine interfacing, neural interfaces, brain chip implants.
[03:32:08.766 --> 03:32:10.087]  This stuff sounds like sci-fi.
[03:32:10.167 --> 03:32:10.847]  I get it, folks.
[03:32:11.148 --> 03:32:12.649]  But this stuff, it's all out there.
[03:32:13.829 --> 03:32:14.750]  Don't take my word for it.
[03:32:15.010 --> 03:32:17.712]  Go get up on the PubMed, NIH.gov.
[03:32:40.467 --> 03:32:52.797]  I'm glad you said that because I think that we need researchers right now to go download these articles, download the videos, get your own copies because I think they are going to try and wipe this stuff out real fast.
[03:32:53.097 --> 03:32:56.420]  Get the toxicity studies, get them downloaded.
[03:32:56.460 --> 03:32:57.741]  We're going to need this stuff because
[03:32:58.560 --> 03:33:07.785]  When you see what it does to people's blood and then you look at like the blood slides and what's happening to people, like we're gonna need this kind of data for Nuremberg 2.0, everybody.
[03:33:07.905 --> 03:33:12.267]  So get out there, get researching this, get off, stop being mentally lazy.
[03:33:12.667 --> 03:33:17.430]  Listen, they're showing articles about Jeffrey Epstein involved at every level.
[03:33:17.470 --> 03:33:22.312]  He was the pimp to get the money, the drugs, the underage kids, whatever the scientists wanted.
[03:33:25.153 --> 03:33:40.215]  I want to talk now Alex about the quote-unquote pandemic and where we what's happened up to now and what's now happening.
[03:33:40.495 --> 03:33:43.776]  Okay, and and there's a very key thing.
[03:33:43.996 --> 03:33:49.297]  This is this is what I meant about the Rosetta Stone in the sense of understanding the current situation.
[03:33:49.679 --> 03:33:51.841]  I feel like we haven't had a full grasp of it.
[03:33:51.881 --> 03:33:53.763]  There's these logical contradictions out there.
[03:33:54.063 --> 03:33:55.724]  Hey, it's never been isolated.
[03:33:56.065 --> 03:33:59.968]  Nobody's ever, you know, done the sequencing of it.
[03:34:00.769 --> 03:34:02.470]  But hey, there's this gain-of-function research.
[03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:03.571]  How do you reconcile these?
[03:34:03.591 --> 03:34:04.792]  There's contradictory, right?
[03:34:05.132 --> 03:34:08.635]  But they can both exist at the same time and be true, and I'll tell you how.
[03:34:11.117 --> 03:34:16.342]  Basically, one of the science friends said to me, they started loading graphene oxide
[03:34:16.812 --> 03:34:22.833]  In a bunch of the regular vaccines, flu, HPV, etc., etc., back in 2017, 2018.
[03:34:23.954 --> 03:34:25.574]  And by the way, you told me that.
[03:34:25.634 --> 03:34:26.154]  I looked it up.
[03:34:26.234 --> 03:34:26.674]  It's true.
[03:34:27.195 --> 03:34:30.035]  They were calling it like simulants and tracker systems.
[03:34:30.075 --> 03:34:31.156]  But yes, they've been doing it.
[03:34:32.536 --> 03:34:45.139]  In 2017, there was a science lab that basically tested and reported that 43 vaccines out on the market were, they said, contaminated with nanoparticles.
[03:34:45.606 --> 03:34:49.728]  So you just said what I said, they're going to claim it's an accident, but it's amazing they already did it.
[03:34:49.828 --> 03:34:50.569]  Oh, it's an accident.
[03:34:50.589 --> 03:34:51.709]  It's amazing.
[03:35:15.874 --> 03:35:16.094]  Yeah.
[03:35:17.575 --> 03:35:20.155]  So Alex, here's what it appears to have happened, okay?
[03:35:20.836 --> 03:35:27.938]  We know that graphene oxide is designed to make it electro-conductivity, right?
[03:35:28.318 --> 03:35:31.339]  It's the most electro-conductive, thermal conductive substance out there.
[03:35:31.359 --> 03:35:31.799]  What does that mean?
[03:35:31.819 --> 03:35:33.320]  Well, there's EMF all over the place.
[03:35:33.680 --> 03:35:35.600]  We know they're putting 5G towers all over.
[03:35:35.980 --> 03:35:40.742]  We know that the frequency ranges they're operating at are nowhere near their full potential.
[03:35:41.547 --> 03:35:47.971]  We know that they're going to start ratcheting up and using more of the frequency range, but it has awful toxicity issues.
[03:35:49.092 --> 03:35:58.499]  But the theory goes, and I think it's provable, that places like China started really pushing a flu shot that fall 2019.
[03:35:59.299 --> 03:36:04.343]  And other places and long-term care facilities, that's where they're just regularly injecting people.
[03:36:04.803 --> 03:36:08.686]  Okay, so they started getting loaded up with good dosages of graphene oxide.
[03:36:09.212 --> 03:36:12.513]  And then we started to see the, you know, hey, there's this health crisis going on.
[03:36:13.373 --> 03:36:20.234]  Again, you go look at the toxicity studies, you look at some of the things that it's going to do to people, it's going to look like, oh, there's an upper respiratory issue, blah, blah, blah.
[03:36:21.315 --> 03:36:21.555]  Okay?
[03:36:22.215 --> 03:36:33.557]  The other way that this falls into place is we all know that the PCR things, the scan, we all know that they told us hospitals are like war zones and they were empty.
[03:36:34.137 --> 03:36:37.978]  We all know that there's a lot of fraud with the
[03:36:38.464 --> 03:36:41.425]  Coding of deaths, death certificates, and all that, okay?
[03:36:42.185 --> 03:36:46.806]  But we're, do you remember Bill Gates saying, we're in pandemic one right now and pandemic two is coming?
[03:36:47.466 --> 03:36:53.748]  And then he also said at one point, he's like, you know, people aren't really taking this seriously, but the next one they really are.
[03:36:55.129 --> 03:36:59.750]  And he's up there laughing about the damage it's causing to people's lives and the economy.
[03:36:59.770 --> 03:37:01.130]  He's just snickering and laughing.
[03:37:02.290 --> 03:37:03.331]  This guy knows, man.
[03:37:03.431 --> 03:37:04.071]  He knows.
[03:37:04.471 --> 03:37:07.892]  He knows that they started loading up people with the smart dust.
[03:37:09.037 --> 03:37:18.023]  And that now that they're starting to get huge uptake in the population, and the health pass is here to really solidify this whole thing.
[03:37:18.623 --> 03:37:22.425]  This is why they're out with blatant human rights violations right now.
[03:37:22.906 --> 03:37:28.349]  They're not worried about any repercussions because they're so close to crossing the Rubicon, aren't they?
[03:37:28.489 --> 03:37:30.210]  They're so close to getting us into a spot.
[03:37:30.570 --> 03:37:32.631]  Once you get down to 10%, 15% of the holdouts, it's easy.
[03:37:35.504 --> 03:37:39.948]  It's easy to weaponize the rest of the population against us and make it hell on earth to try and live without the stuff.
[03:37:40.108 --> 03:37:41.929]  And it's going to be hell on earth to try and live with it, too.
[03:37:42.870 --> 03:37:46.052]  And then the precedent is set where they can just do anything they want whenever they want.
[03:37:47.534 --> 03:37:47.954]  That's right.
[03:37:48.294 --> 03:37:54.259]  So we have to get everybody's focus on this issue of graphene and graphene oxide.
[03:37:54.739 --> 03:38:02.566]  We, I think, have a good grasp on the synthetic spike protein, the pathogenic priming issue, and that's its own kettle of fish, and that is causing problems.
[03:38:03.513 --> 03:38:05.334]  People are getting sick, okay, from that stuff.
[03:38:05.694 --> 03:38:11.918]  But what's missing is like, what's, do you think it's the synthetic spike protein that's just the viral shedding?
[03:38:12.178 --> 03:38:17.161]  Or do you think that graphene oxide is the, is the biodistribution agent that's actually doing the shedding?
[03:38:18.481 --> 03:38:18.762]  Okay.
[03:38:19.142 --> 03:38:28.267]  And look at, we've got evidence, uh, Gareth Ike on his Twitter showed how in the UK, they just signed contracts to start putting it in the water to do water treatment with graphene oxide.
[03:38:28.823 --> 03:38:33.765]  Dane Wigington, who does Geoengineering Watch, he's on the trail of going, are they putting this in the chemtrails now too?
[03:38:34.825 --> 03:38:36.165]  And it looks like they might be.
[03:38:37.306 --> 03:38:43.087]  So we are going to have a real issue here with this kind of technology deployment.
[03:38:43.988 --> 03:38:49.109]  We need entrepreneurs to start looking at how do you activate it and filter it out of water, pull it out of water.
[03:38:49.329 --> 03:38:51.030]  How do you pull it out of food?
[03:38:51.470 --> 03:38:54.231]  OK, how do you help people detox from this and get it out?
[03:38:54.991 --> 03:38:56.471]  We're going to need entrepreneurs on that.
[03:38:56.871 --> 03:38:57.792]  We are going to need
[03:38:58.948 --> 03:39:01.189]  Lawyers all over the informed consent issue.
[03:39:02.089 --> 03:39:04.570]  We're going to need to talk like America's frontline doctors.
[03:39:04.850 --> 03:39:08.671]  You can't just stick in the antibody dependency enhancement camp.
[03:39:08.771 --> 03:39:09.932]  OK, like, yeah, that's real.
[03:39:10.212 --> 03:39:10.872]  Don't dismiss it.
[03:39:11.252 --> 03:39:12.833]  I think it's a real problem.
[03:39:13.113 --> 03:39:16.334]  Dr. Robert Malone and Michael Yeadon and these guys are great.
[03:39:16.374 --> 03:39:17.034]  They're all over it.
[03:39:17.434 --> 03:39:26.717]  But we need people now to really dive deep and get their head through all this, this scientific information on graphene oxide, because, guys, this, I think,
[03:39:27.119 --> 03:39:28.440]  Is how we can get them.
[03:39:28.560 --> 03:39:30.381]  This is the real crime against humanity.
[03:39:30.421 --> 03:39:30.962]  That's right here.
[03:39:33.724 --> 03:39:37.727]  The one thing I want to just finish off with saying is gain of function.
[03:39:38.267 --> 03:39:39.768]  The Wuhan lab leak theory.
[03:39:41.709 --> 03:39:51.236]  I believe I'm speculating here, but I believe that that is them basically involved in the design of the synthetic spike protein.
[03:39:52.457 --> 03:39:54.518]  Okay, I think that's what's going on there.
[03:39:54.598 --> 03:39:55.399]  That's the synthetic.
[03:39:55.419 --> 03:39:56.880]  That's the that's the biotech side.
[03:39:57.469 --> 03:39:57.649]  Right?
[03:39:59.889 --> 03:40:10.491]  I also want to say that I think Dr. Andrew Kaufman, John Rapoport, Thomas Cowan, and others are vindicated about the no isolation of the novel coronavirus.
[03:40:13.052 --> 03:40:14.512]  Chris Massey, she's in Toronto.
[03:40:14.772 --> 03:40:15.472]  She's on Twitter.
[03:40:15.912 --> 03:40:23.113]  She's been coordinating people around the world to file FOIA requests with all sorts of different government bodies and NGOs saying, do you have any samples?
[03:40:23.133 --> 03:40:26.154]  Do you have any records that show isolation, that show that it's been sequenced?
[03:40:27.299 --> 03:40:31.261]  And true isolation, not your phony isolation where there's a bunch of other stuff in the petri dish.
[03:40:32.501 --> 03:40:34.362]  No records, no records, no records.
[03:40:34.382 --> 03:40:36.823]  Okay, so we've got to get our head.
[03:40:37.143 --> 03:40:37.704]  It's kind of weird.
[03:40:37.744 --> 03:40:39.925]  On one hand, I'm saying, hey, there's no coronavirus.
[03:40:39.945 --> 03:40:40.705]  There's no pandemic.
[03:40:41.049 --> 03:40:46.451]  But no, we have to, we have to get ourselves dialed in and understand exactly what's going on and what we're up against.
[03:40:46.491 --> 03:40:54.534]  Because I feel that as a research community, we have not had a full grasp of what's happening and we've been actively trying to get our head around it.
[03:40:55.014 --> 03:40:58.296]  But because we don't have a full grasp, it's allowing them to gain more and more ground.
[03:40:58.356 --> 03:40:59.076]  We're losing ground.
[03:40:59.756 --> 03:41:04.758]  We can, we can turn the tide if we can have the full, if we're armed with the full truth.
[03:41:05.759 --> 03:41:07.579]  Then we, then we've got a fighting chance here.
[03:41:07.599 --> 03:41:09.340]  I feel like we've got a fighting chance anyway.
[03:41:11.229 --> 03:41:11.729]  Um, okay.
[03:41:11.910 --> 03:41:12.910]  Final, final points.
[03:41:13.691 --> 03:41:15.172]  Hey brother, I'm here listening to you.
[03:41:15.192 --> 03:41:16.132]  I'm not going to interrupt you.
[03:41:16.352 --> 03:41:17.633]  So I'm sitting here listening to you.
[03:41:18.054 --> 03:41:19.214]  You just keep rolling and going through.
[03:41:19.234 --> 03:41:19.855]  You're doing a great job.
[03:41:21.116 --> 03:41:21.676]  Thanks Alex.
[03:41:21.696 --> 03:41:24.398]  A couple of points I want to make and just wrapping up.
[03:41:27.940 --> 03:41:35.025]  This has been a lot on my mind the last, like the light bulb really went on a couple of weeks ago and it's been drinking from a fire hose of information.
[03:41:35.925 --> 03:41:38.247]  It's good to get it out and I just hope that other people
[03:41:38.854 --> 03:41:39.454]  Pick this up.
[03:41:39.514 --> 03:41:40.275]  I'm not the only one.
[03:41:40.315 --> 03:41:41.796]  There are other people like the Spaniard.
[03:41:41.836 --> 03:41:43.056]  There's a team in Spain.
[03:41:43.076 --> 03:41:44.157]  There's a team in Argentina.
[03:41:44.517 --> 03:41:50.141]  They've now shown that saline solution is loaded with graphics, graphene oxide.
[03:41:50.501 --> 03:41:52.282]  They've shown how a bunch of other shots are.
[03:41:52.302 --> 03:41:53.663]  They recently tested Moderna.
[03:41:54.143 --> 03:41:54.243]  OK.
[03:41:55.023 --> 03:41:56.704]  And people are connecting the dots.
[03:41:56.744 --> 03:41:57.285]  They're getting it.
[03:41:57.865 --> 03:41:58.705]  But we need more.
[03:41:58.806 --> 03:42:02.888]  We need a tidal wave of info warriors to get on this.
[03:42:03.848 --> 03:42:08.111]  I would also what I want to end up saying and was saying here is that they know
[03:42:08.592 --> 03:42:09.913]  There are certain levels they know.
[03:42:10.173 --> 03:42:15.777]  A good example is that the FDA has a scandal.
[03:42:15.817 --> 03:42:22.061]  You go to Stat News and you can see there's a scandal with an Alzheimer's disease drug from Biogen.
[03:42:23.182 --> 03:42:29.626]  And it has lawyers and scientists and all sorts of people, compliance people, just up in arms.
[03:42:29.646 --> 03:42:30.747]  They're just beside themselves.
[03:42:31.687 --> 03:42:34.249]  An expert panel voted unanimously
[03:42:34.582 --> 03:42:38.384]  But this drug was not going to go up to market because of all sorts of safety issues.
[03:42:38.544 --> 03:42:46.208]  And executives at the pharma company met with executives at FDA and said, nah, we're going to approve it anyway.
[03:42:46.728 --> 03:42:51.651]  So this is the first time ever you got an expert panel voting 18 to zero to say this thing isn't fit to go to market.
[03:42:51.911 --> 03:42:55.913]  And then that decision being overridden by a bunch of bureaucrats and executives.
[03:42:56.654 --> 03:43:01.957]  And I would submit to you that they know there's a wave of neurodegenerative diseases coming.
[03:43:02.277 --> 03:43:02.497]  Okay.
[03:43:02.850 --> 03:43:05.631]  And they're planning to make good on that.
[03:43:06.792 --> 03:43:09.793]  Another one, there's a press release from the FDA.
[03:43:10.733 --> 03:43:20.017]  There's a press release from the FDA saying, hey, the first ever blood thinner for children has been approved.
[03:43:21.577 --> 03:43:24.418]  And then it talks about potentially deadly blood clots in kids.
[03:43:25.239 --> 03:43:31.521]  Now, we know they're gearing up to say this is FDA approved, the shot, therefore you don't have any excuse not to mandate it.
[03:43:31.857 --> 03:43:35.380]  And we know they're gearing up to say, yeah, let's move it down to kids, kids five and up.
[03:43:36.500 --> 03:43:37.421]  They're not going to stop there.
[03:43:37.581 --> 03:43:38.362]  It's going to be everybody.
[03:43:38.522 --> 03:43:44.366]  It's going to be, you know, but if they get their way, but they know that there's going to be blood clotting issues in kids.
[03:43:44.406 --> 03:43:47.508]  They know there's neurodegenerative brain diseases on the road ahead.
[03:43:48.149 --> 03:43:53.473]  Like folks, this is, this is all about to get very, very real.
[03:43:54.053 --> 03:43:57.375]  It's going to make the last year and a half look like a walk in the park.
[03:43:57.415 --> 03:43:57.916]  What's coming.
[03:43:58.256 --> 03:43:59.917]  And I think we're, we're on the precipice.
[03:43:59.977 --> 03:44:00.878]  We are weeks away.
[03:44:01.391 --> 03:44:04.492]  From this thing going to the next level.
[03:44:06.453 --> 03:44:08.394]  And Alex, you know, thank you for having me on.
[03:44:08.634 --> 03:44:09.574]  I really appreciate it.
[03:44:09.854 --> 03:44:17.197]  And I just pray that other people can carry this forward and do a better job with it than I can.
[03:44:17.617 --> 03:44:25.981]  Well, Liberty Man, you've really laid out some incredible information and you gave us big stacks of documentation and government studies about everything you're talking about.
[03:44:26.521 --> 03:44:28.122]  Dangerous nanoparticles containing 43
[03:44:30.034 --> 03:44:30.414]  We're good.
[03:44:49.582 --> 03:44:50.323]  We'll go public.
[03:44:50.843 --> 03:44:59.449]  I hope the industry will stand up and say no, because by getting emergency authorization and bypassing regular trials, they're just in a wild blue yonder now.
[03:45:00.070 --> 03:45:01.531]  And oh, your vaccine didn't work.
[03:45:01.611 --> 03:45:03.212]  You need them every few months now.
[03:45:03.512 --> 03:45:05.213]  Now they're saying five shots a year.
[03:45:05.774 --> 03:45:09.236]  And like you said, the main ingredient is this graphene oxide.
[03:45:09.256 --> 03:45:14.120]  I mean, this is a science fiction nightmare dystopia movie we're living in.
[03:45:14.140 --> 03:45:17.723]  We're not at the movie theater eating Milk Dugs and drinking a cold Coca-Cola.
[03:45:18.283 --> 03:45:19.424]  You know, having some popcorn.
[03:45:19.644 --> 03:45:20.625]  This is really happening.
[03:45:22.426 --> 03:45:22.746]  It is.
[03:45:23.326 --> 03:45:25.668]  And so many people have said that to me that I've talked about this.
[03:45:25.808 --> 03:45:28.950]  It feels like, you know, what you're telling me, it feels like I'm living in a movie.
[03:45:29.270 --> 03:45:31.632]  And the reason is because of all the predictive programming.
[03:45:32.052 --> 03:45:32.893]  And it's all out there, too.
[03:45:32.913 --> 03:45:40.178]  You look at like Marvel movies like Venom and there's a whole bunch of them where there's like this black substance that, you know, enters people's bodies and takes control of them.
[03:45:40.518 --> 03:45:41.979]  That's all predictive programming of this.
[03:45:43.993 --> 03:45:44.633]  It really is.
[03:45:44.713 --> 03:45:50.897]  I mean, the ultimate goal of any warfare is to get control of the human body and to make you dependent on that substance that controls you.
[03:45:51.077 --> 03:45:52.517]  And this is it.
[03:45:52.577 --> 03:45:58.921]  But just like Hitler launched a blitzkrieg and people woke up and fought it, evil always hits up front really strong.
[03:45:59.641 --> 03:46:04.183]  But then quickly, people organize against it and figure out what's happening and turn the tide.
[03:46:05.024 --> 03:46:09.066]  Liberty Man, anywhere else people should visit or any other places they should check out here?
[03:46:12.298 --> 03:46:14.399]  Well, Infowars.com is a pretty good site.
[03:46:15.959 --> 03:46:18.120]  Well, I appreciate you and the film you're making.
[03:46:18.160 --> 03:46:23.422]  And I want to say, you would do a better voiceover listening to you today than I would in the film.
[03:46:23.442 --> 03:46:28.364]  So maybe we should have you as some of the voiceover, because I think you're doing a great job here and you have a great voice.
[03:46:28.424 --> 03:46:31.245]  And I appreciate you and your wife and your children, your family, everybody.
[03:46:31.285 --> 03:46:33.966]  And I appreciate your crew, because we're all in this together.
[03:46:34.006 --> 03:46:36.747]  And one thing's for sure, we're not in boring times.
[03:46:37.167 --> 03:46:39.168]  People are bored of Netflix or bored of sports.
[03:46:39.248 --> 03:46:41.249]  But if they wake up to the real world,
[03:46:42.270 --> 03:46:44.792]  Liberty Man, they're going to realize that the fight is now.
[03:46:46.253 --> 03:46:46.933]  The fight is now.
[03:46:46.993 --> 03:46:48.614]  We need men to be men.
[03:46:48.854 --> 03:46:49.975]  We need women to stand up.
[03:46:50.055 --> 03:46:51.496]  We need families to be strong.
[03:46:53.858 --> 03:46:55.059]  We need to be there for our kids.
[03:46:55.619 --> 03:47:00.923]  Like this is, go watch Braveheart again or something on the weekend instead of some stupid other thing.
[03:47:01.063 --> 03:47:02.804]  You know, go watch something that's going to really
[03:47:03.854 --> 03:47:04.314]  Yeah, they do.
[03:47:34.179 --> 03:47:35.640]  You know, like most things they do, right?
[03:47:35.680 --> 03:47:38.403]  There's usually multiple agendas at play, overlapping agendas.
[03:47:38.423 --> 03:47:39.203]  They're really good at that.
[03:47:39.223 --> 03:47:41.125]  All right.
[03:47:41.205 --> 03:47:41.665]  Powerful.
[03:47:41.706 --> 03:47:43.047]  Liberty Man, thank you so much, brother.
[03:47:43.067 --> 03:47:43.907]  Look forward to talking to you soon.
[03:47:43.927 --> 03:47:45.429]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:47:45.609 --> 03:47:45.809]  Bye.
[03:47:46.289 --> 03:47:46.510]  All right.
[03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:47.350]  There he goes.
[03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.771]  All right.
[03:47:47.851 --> 03:47:57.399]  This has been a marathon transmission with David Icke and Robert Barnes and Dr. Greer and now Liberty Man and yours truly.
[03:48:00.427 --> 03:48:02.009]  I'm kind of like the last Matrix movie.
[03:48:02.049 --> 03:48:05.873]  The enemy drill machines are like drill through the wall right now.
[03:48:05.893 --> 03:48:14.303]  And we just hope that you out there like Neo are waking up and taking action so that we can take our consciousness back and defeat this.
[03:48:14.363 --> 03:48:16.586]  But regardless, we've already had a good run.
[03:48:17.244 --> 03:48:28.254]  We've had some big effects and people really realize what he told the truth, but I have had firsthand experience now with the FBI, the Justice Department, all these Democrat lawyers and people, and the biggest thing is I don't even hate them.
[03:48:28.554 --> 03:48:29.735]  They're so soulless.
[03:48:30.356 --> 03:48:36.582]  Other than hate of freedom and other than hate of truth, they are just singularly like Agent Smith of the Matrix.
[03:48:37.002 --> 03:48:38.964]  They want you destroyed.
[03:48:40.157 --> 03:48:48.377]  And I think people who've not been as deep of a fight as I've been in, I don't think you realize how far the country and the world's gone.
[03:48:48.417 --> 03:48:49.340]  I mean, it's gone.
[03:48:50.046 --> 03:48:52.567]  But that's okay, because you got to hit bottom before you come back up.
[03:48:53.467 --> 03:48:55.428]  Please financially support the broadcast.

[03:49:35.003 --> 03:49:36.023]  It's a really great formula.
[03:49:36.043 --> 03:49:37.944]  50% off, and it's about to sell out.

[03:49:51.890 --> 03:49:57.852]  That can run for a week because we've got a decent supply of that, but it's running out fast.

[03:50:11.237 --> 03:50:12.738]  The good news is we knew this was coming.
[03:50:12.758 --> 03:50:16.181]  The bad news is they went ahead with the plan, and it's just totally insane.

[03:50:23.327 --> 03:50:23.527]  tomorrow.
[03:50:26.874 --> 03:50:30.257]  Gosh, it's like four or five hours probably until I go live.
[03:50:30.377 --> 03:50:32.919]  Lord willing, every day is a blessing at 4 p.m.
[03:50:32.939 --> 03:50:36.742]  Central with a regular Sunday show I've been doing now for 14, 15 years.
[03:50:37.242 --> 03:50:38.924]  Time just moves so damn fast now.
[03:50:39.444 --> 03:50:43.187]  Been on air 27, doing a Sunday show for 15, 16 years.
[03:50:44.308 --> 03:50:45.469]  Gosh, how long have I been doing this?
[03:50:45.549 --> 03:50:45.849]  It's about 2000.
[03:50:48.069 --> 03:50:50.230]  2005.
[03:50:48.089 --> 03:50:50.230]  Goodness, 16 years.
[03:50:51.631 --> 03:50:53.832]  And, uh, just a Sunday show.
[03:50:53.852 --> 03:50:54.573]  Seems like yesterday.
[03:50:55.373 --> 03:51:00.956]  And I really appreciate the crew that was up here at, like, hell, they weren't up here early this morning to do interviews and stuff.
[03:51:00.976 --> 03:51:03.298]  So, some of this crew's been up here since 7 a.m.
[03:51:03.318 --> 03:51:07.000]  Uh, so, uh, just a lot of craziness going on.
[03:51:07.800 --> 03:51:08.801]  And I appreciate everybody
[03:51:09.735 --> 03:51:14.718]  And so I hope you'll keep us on air and I hope you realize we're in such a war and I hope you'll share the articles and share the videos.
[03:51:15.018 --> 03:51:16.119]  I get these emails constantly.
[03:51:16.139 --> 03:51:17.080]  I see text messages.
[03:51:18.380 --> 03:51:19.401]  The crew shows me the emails.
[03:51:19.421 --> 03:51:24.404]  They go, these people are asking permission to take clips of your show and put them on their local show or radio.
[03:51:25.425 --> 03:51:26.265]  It's all free to air.
[03:51:26.285 --> 03:51:26.986]  There's no permission.
[03:51:27.366 --> 03:51:30.428]  You can edit it, put it upside down, attack me, love me, I don't care.
[03:51:30.808 --> 03:51:33.930]  Just communicate the information out and get it out your hell.
[03:51:34.351 --> 03:51:36.412]  We get out of this digital prison they tried to put us in.
[03:51:37.000 --> 03:51:37.981]  Okay, it's an epic fight.
[03:51:38.001 --> 03:51:40.843]  Like I said, thanks for the special Saturday transmission.
[03:51:41.204 --> 03:51:41.984]  Thanks to all our guests.
[03:51:42.004 --> 03:51:42.605]  Thanks to the crew.

[03:51:46.168 --> 03:51:46.528]  Central.
[03:51:46.628 --> 03:51:47.649]  InfoWars.com.
[03:51:47.929 --> 03:51:48.970]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:51:48.990 --> 03:51:51.773]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:51:53.206 --> 03:51:54.507]  Keep us on air.
[03:51:54.627 --> 03:51:57.050]  We'll continue to bring you the banned guests.
[03:51:57.170 --> 03:52:00.673]  We'll continue to bring the information that no one else will touch.
[03:52:01.033 --> 03:52:01.734]  Keep us on air.
[03:52:01.814 --> 03:52:03.055]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:52:03.095 --> 03:52:16.587]  The new supplements that we have, the latest in the InfoWars Life Supplement line, the Vitamin D3 with Calcium Gummies, the Vitamin C with Zinc and the Whole Food Multivitamins, or if you buy the Combo Pack with all three at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:52:16.647 --> 03:52:19.110]  And you know, I'm telling you, the Vitamin D Gummies
[03:52:20.151 --> 03:52:21.873]  This is a great thing for your kids.
[03:52:21.893 --> 03:52:22.554]  They're going to love it.
[03:52:22.574 --> 03:52:24.236]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[03:52:24.296 --> 03:52:24.817]  It's healthy.
[03:52:25.698 --> 03:52:27.180]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[03:52:27.220 --> 03:52:28.762]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[03:52:28.782 --> 03:52:30.444]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[03:52:30.845 --> 03:52:31.846]  The calcium, good for them.
[03:52:31.886 --> 03:52:32.367]  The vitamin D.
[03:52:33.658 --> 03:52:36.322]  So, that's at infowarsstore.com.
[03:52:36.682 --> 03:52:39.226]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[03:52:39.306 --> 03:52:47.437]  So, the supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies, the emergency supplies at infowarsstore.com.
[03:52:47.537 --> 03:52:49.140]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[03:52:49.160 --> 03:52:50.762]  We cannot thank you enough.
[03:52:50.933 --> 03:53:05.544]  This is a three hour, 50 minute, emergency Saturday report that we came in and did these interviews to get out to you and everybody else that cares about freedom because right now is the time to be politically and culturally engaged, spiritually engaged.
[03:53:05.984 --> 03:53:08.146]  Now's the time to be awake and warning others.
[03:53:08.666 --> 03:53:10.328]  This is the time for Paul Revere's.
[03:53:11.008 --> 03:53:13.270]  This is the time for people to say no like Tiananmen Square.
[03:53:13.752 --> 03:53:20.136]  This is the time for people to stand up like in the Civil Rights Movement and say enough is enough because this is a corporate, globalist revolution.
[03:53:20.457 --> 03:53:21.637]  We covered it at the very start.
[03:53:22.478 --> 03:53:32.364]  If you just tuned in towards the end of this in the streams or to one of the archives or you're listening on a local radio station, they are passing, they have the votes right now.
[03:53:32.384 --> 03:53:33.745]  They're trying to pass it this weekend.
[03:53:34.026 --> 03:53:37.128]  They've got the Senators, 17 extra Republicans.
[03:53:38.157 --> 03:53:49.724]  To put AI face scanning and breathalyzers in all cars to watch you and make sure you're behaving yourself, tied to taxing by the mile with this new AI authority that ties into your vaccine passport.
[03:53:50.004 --> 03:53:52.025]  And then if you don't do what they say, they just turn your car off.
[03:53:52.246 --> 03:53:53.406]  That is in the legislation.
[03:53:53.947 --> 03:54:05.694]  So just like the 1996 Telecommunications Act set up the fact that cell phones would track and triangulate as a control list, this is the enabling legislation for everything else that's now about to come and so much more.
[03:54:07.290 --> 03:54:15.034]  Snowden joins battle against iPhone scanning plan as Apple insults privacy activists as, quote, screeching voices of the minority.
[03:54:16.274 --> 03:54:18.816]  Apple's all about, we're privacy, we protect your privacy.
[03:54:18.856 --> 03:54:20.897]  Meanwhile, they are based in communist China.
[03:54:20.917 --> 03:54:22.257]  They've given the code keys to China.
[03:54:22.958 --> 03:54:25.159]  And now they're saying, we're going to scan all your photos.
[03:54:26.414 --> 03:54:29.356]  Without asking you, without a warrant, to make sure there's not child porn on it.
[03:54:29.756 --> 03:54:33.238]  That's really just their excuse on the cloud to admit they're spying on you.
[03:54:33.538 --> 03:54:43.103]  When it's actually the folks that are in control and run Apple, like Steve Jobs' wife, that's connected to Jeffrey Epstein and the island and all the rest of it.
[03:54:43.463 --> 03:54:45.024]  So that's their pretext too.
[03:54:45.325 --> 03:54:50.908]  They're the new AI god that's going to spy on you and contact trace you and look at all your photos for your own good.
[03:54:51.328 --> 03:54:53.209]  Absolutely disgusting.
[03:54:53.229 --> 03:54:54.550]  That's why they've got all the billboards saying,
[03:54:55.899 --> 03:55:05.726]  Apple is privacy and that ties into the legislation that they've got the votes to pass right now in the Senate and the House to have AI watch you under law in all cars.
[03:55:06.586 --> 03:55:07.387]  But you gotta pay for it.
[03:55:07.727 --> 03:55:12.630]  Meanwhile, Teen Vogue urges Gen Z to mobilize, build socialist future.
[03:55:13.011 --> 03:55:14.472]  No future under capitalism.
[03:55:15.718 --> 03:55:23.904]  Offshore megabanks tax-exempt teaching kids about socialism so they will accept a universal income and be controlled by it and not be a threat to the system.
[03:55:24.405 --> 03:55:30.729]  And then university may be subject to investigation after it's caught using body parts of babies born alive.
[03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:33.011]  That was in the documents years ago.
[03:55:33.271 --> 03:55:34.172]  They keep them alive.
[03:55:34.232 --> 03:55:36.353]  They have auctions for the body parts.
[03:55:36.373 --> 03:55:40.516]  They get five, six times the amount when they can wait a week or so to get the bids in.
[03:55:41.497 --> 03:55:49.520]  Take the baby, take all of its organs, it dies, the heart's the last thing they take, and then they get a higher rate of, quote, fresh organs sold.
[03:55:49.960 --> 03:55:52.081]  And that is illegal to keep a baby alive after you kill it.
[03:55:52.381 --> 03:56:01.724]  Under law, you can kill it still inside the vagina once you've gotten it out of the uterus and past the cervix, but you have to kill it while the head is still in the vagina.
[03:56:01.984 --> 03:56:05.265]  They stick a sucker tube in the back of the head, a needle, and suck the brain out.
[03:56:05.905 --> 03:56:09.588]  If you keep them alive, it is felony premeditated murder.
[03:56:10.249 --> 03:56:14.633]  And so that's the criminal activity with major universities running those operations.
[03:56:14.653 --> 03:56:20.418]  We told you about that first, and thank you for getting the word out and vindicating us because we're under massive attack because of it.
[03:56:20.458 --> 03:56:23.360]  Humanity's been turned into a commodity by these sick globalists.
[03:56:24.401 --> 03:56:28.565]  And then finally, we've got CNN saying, not being vaccinated, same as drunk driving.
[03:56:29.619 --> 03:56:29.979]  We're good to go.
[03:57:00.299 --> 03:57:01.200]  But it's all a fraud.
[03:57:01.240 --> 03:57:01.840]  It's all a lie.
[03:57:01.880 --> 03:57:09.785]  We have to reject it and say no and then prosecute these globalist cartels that cooked up COVID-19 and released it on the world.
[03:57:10.206 --> 03:57:13.808]  So again, thanks to the crew for the great job they've done putting this together.
[03:57:13.908 --> 03:57:15.209]  Thanks to all the guests that came on.
[03:57:15.947 --> 03:57:21.691]  We're definitely going to cut out some of these interviews in the next few days and put them out by themselves because all of these are really amazing.
[03:57:22.011 --> 03:57:23.873]  That's it for this emergency transmission.
[03:57:24.353 --> 03:57:25.394]  Now you know the rest, folks.
[03:57:25.934 --> 03:57:30.017]  Only way people learn about this is if you share this report right now.
[03:57:30.397 --> 03:57:31.758]  So God bless and good luck.
[03:57:31.778 --> 03:57:32.419]  Take action.
