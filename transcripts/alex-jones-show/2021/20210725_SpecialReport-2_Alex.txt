[00:00:00.854 --> 00:00:18.136]  Ladies and gentlemen, the information I'm about to reveal here is the biggest news story and has the greatest impact and import on humanity of any story in the 21st century, in the last 21 years of this century.
[00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:22.815]  This information is as big as Adolf Hitler starting World War II.
[00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:27.779]  It's as big as Lenin and Stalin and the Soviet Union and the crimes they committed.
[00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.860]  This is as big as Mao Zedong.
[00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.862]  That all happened in the 20th century.
[00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:36.265]  This is the biggest news in the 21st century.
[00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:42.350]  It's 100% documented, hiding in plain view, and we're about to lay it out right now.
[00:00:48.177 --> 00:01:12.883]  Respected international organizations of doctors, physicians, scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, you name it, have formed in the last year and a half all over the world and they've been reviewing studies going back decades and current studies where it was conclusively known in the literature at prestigious facilities like the University of Texas Level 4 Lab in Galveston, Texas by 2012
[00:01:14.443 --> 00:01:28.833]  That if you try to create a vaccine for the protein shell of a coronavirus, it makes the body attack the lungs, brain and heart and create billions of tiny micro blood clots that then start forming larger blood clots.
[00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:44.083]  And what's incredible now is prestigious respected doctors and scientists and doctors that head up major ERs in Canada and others are seeing in their patients that have been injected with these experimental shots, the exact same thing happening.
[00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:49.567]  Now, I'm going to get to this report and then I'm going to go through some of the background and show you some of the studies.
[00:01:49.707 --> 00:01:57.093]  But first, do you know who funded the major three-year study at the University of Texas, Galveston?
[00:01:57.613 --> 00:01:58.634]  Whose name is on the top of it?
[00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:00.255]  Anthony Fauci.
[00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:10.343]  And when they came back to him testing three vaccines that would then attack that protein in the Corona SARS family, same as COVID-19, they said, proceed with extreme caution.
[00:02:11.084 --> 00:02:12.725]  Do not make a human vaccine out of this.
[00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:13.786]  It actually says that.
[00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.833]  Now it turns out there are hundreds of prominent studies in the British Medical Journal and the New England Medical Journal and others that all knew this.
[00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:39.298]  And all these other prestigious scientists like Dr. Yidan, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, and Wolfgang Wudarg and others went public before this started a year ago and put out emergency injunctions to the EU saying this is going to happen, blood clots, and they still ignored it.
[00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:41.419]  And then you saw the blood clots and the death.
[00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:42.819]  But here's the big news.
[00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:44.100]  I'm going to play this first report.
[00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:53.626]  They keep saying it's rare, it's rare, it's rare when your mom, your dad, your neighbor, your son, your daughter, or you get really sick or die from it.
[00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:54.527]  But it's not.
[00:02:55.707 --> 00:03:02.151]  In the studies of rats, and in the studies of ferrets and other animals, the vast majority develop blood clots and then die within a few months.
[00:03:02.772 --> 00:03:05.193]  In humans, they estimate it'll take a few years because we're a lot tougher.
[00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:06.955]  But it gets worse.
[00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:13.559]  Dr. Charles Hoff, very respected over a whole hospital facility, and has a whole bunch of his own private patients,
[00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:26.316]  Has been having his patients go in that have been given the Moderna, Pfizer, and other injections, and they're finding exactly what is in the UT studies, the British studies, and others with the blood clots.
[00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:27.136]  So many of them.
[00:03:27.237 --> 00:03:28.097]  It's just incredible.
[00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:33.021]  So here's a nine minute report of him on a doctor's round table report.
[00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:35.243]  And remember this is being suppressed on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:38.885]  People with medical degrees, with studies, with science.
[00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:40.707]  And then if you question it,
[00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:48.100]  Fauci and the media say that we're murderers for simply questioning the fact that they're pushing an experimental shot on us.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.703]  So, watch this report.
[00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:52.547]  Write this information down.
[00:03:53.618 --> 00:04:02.087]  And while he's speaking, we're going to be putting on screen some of the mainline studies, again, from top of the line facilities, that found exactly what he's seeing in his patients.
[00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:06.731]  And they're finding this in other hospitals and clinics all over the world.
[00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:15.500]  But they're trying to then gaslight everyone and say, you can't question it, and you must take it, and you must have this vaccine passport, which is the endgame of a global ID.
[00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:16.981]  You spoke to
[00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:43.865]  A potential mechanism of action of the injury.
[00:04:44.846 --> 00:04:49.731]  And you mentioned to me the use of a D-dimer test, which we all know what it's for, but we're going to have to explain a little bit.
[00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:53.975]  Could you please speak to this a little bit and give the relevant context and introduction, please?
[00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:56.777]  Because I think this is really groundbreaking and important.
[00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:58.859]  Yes.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.160]  Yeah.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.720]  Thank you.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.582]  So one of the
[00:05:03.217 --> 00:05:19.057]  The key things that really bothered me when I started to see serious vaccine injuries in my own patients is that I had no idea what the mechanism of injury was, and therefore, as their doctor, I had no idea how to treat it.
[00:05:19.838 --> 00:05:28.180]  Because, you know, as their family doctor, they would come to me for help and I needed to help them and I was clueless.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:39.803]  I mean, this is an experiment and I was aware that there was literally what we call iatrogenic disease, a medically induced disease being produced by this vaccine.
[00:05:40.303 --> 00:05:45.264]  And so I had asked this in my open letter to Dr. Bonnie Henry, our Provincial Health Officer,
[00:05:46.144 --> 00:05:51.668]  What is the mechanism of injury and how do I treat this as these people's doctor?
[00:05:51.908 --> 00:05:53.209]  And of course, nobody knew.
[00:05:54.453 --> 00:06:01.299]  And the vaccine manufacturers had told us that the COVID spike protein does not go intravenous.
[00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:10.086]  It stays in the arm, the antibodies to the spike protein are produced in the arm, and that's what we had been found.
[00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:20.755]  But scientists now, and Dr. Brody has actually very clearly revealed this, that only 25% of the vaccine actually stays in the arm.
[00:06:21.315 --> 00:06:23.317]  And the rest of it, so these vaccines
[00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:24.521]  All right.
[00:06:25.285 --> 00:06:25.567]  All right.
[00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:30.940]  A vast number of little messenger RNA strands.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.382]  The Moderna vaccine has 40 trillion messenger RNA molecules per vaccine dose.
[00:06:39.402 --> 00:06:40.322]  40 trillion!
[00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:45.624]  So, these are wrapped in a little lipid capsule.
[00:06:45.904 --> 00:06:49.025]  The lipid capsule is to enable them to be absorbed into the cells.
[00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:53.487]  So, this is injected into the person's arm and their deltoid muscle of the shoulder.
[00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:54.447]  From there,
[00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:55.348]  Yes, absolutely!
[00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:16.513]  And I think every doctor knows that absorption from the circulation occurs in capillary networks because that's where the blood slows right down.
[00:07:17.214 --> 00:07:19.095]  It's going through tiny, tiny vessels.
[00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:34.725]  So these little nano capsules containing these trillions of messenger RNA molecules are absorbed into the lining around the capillaries, what medically we call the vascular endothelium.
[00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:41.289]  So these little packages are absorbed into the cells around the vessels.
[00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:42.589]  The package is open.
[00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:52.035]  The body recognizes these messenger RNA strands as a gene and gets to work making COVID spike proteins.
[00:07:52.395 --> 00:07:57.839]  So in a virus, those COVID spike proteins form part of the viral capsule.
[00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:00.503]  But the problem is they're not in a virus.
[00:08:00.804 --> 00:08:03.810]  They're in the cells around blood vessels.
[00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:09.723]  So as a result, they become part of the cell wall of that cell.
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:22.604]  So normally, the cells that surround your blood vessels have to be very, very smooth to enable good and unimpeded flow of blood.
[00:08:22.864 --> 00:08:30.047]  But as soon as you've got all these little spike proteins that become part of the cell wall, it's now a rough surface.
[00:08:30.107 --> 00:08:32.448]  It's going to be like a very coarse sandpaper.
[00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:33.588]  It's now
[00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:38.230]  What the platelets are going to interpret as a damaged vessel.
[00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.750]  It's no longer smooth.
[00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:40.390]  It's rough.
[00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:49.253]  So clotting is inevitable because the platelets that come down that vessel are going to hit a rough spot and assume this must be a damaged vessel.
[00:08:49.293 --> 00:08:51.774]  This vessel needs to be blocked to stop the bleeding.
[00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:53.135]  That's how our clotting works.
[00:08:53.914 --> 00:09:08.648]  So clots are, because of this and because of the nature of this, clots are inevitable because of these spike proteins in the capillary networks.
[00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:12.451]  So I set out to then try and prove this.
[00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.136]  Could this theory be correct?
[00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:22.082]  And so the problem is these little clots in the capillary networks are microscopic and they are scattered.
[00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:24.764]  So they're not going to show on any scan.
[00:09:24.784 --> 00:09:27.186]  They're just too small and too scattered.
[00:09:27.467 --> 00:09:30.649]  It's not like the big clots that cause strokes or heart attacks.
[00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.632]  They're too small and they're too scattered.
[00:09:34.514 --> 00:09:37.396]  So how on earth can we know if the person clotted?
[00:09:37.817 --> 00:09:41.320]  And the only way is with a blood test called a D-dimer.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.424]  So the D-dimer is a blood test that will show up a recent clot.
[00:09:46.464 --> 00:09:49.487]  It won't show up an old clot, it shows up a new clot.
[00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:55.592]  And it doesn't tell you where the clot is, it just tells you that the clotting mechanism has been activated.
[00:09:56.232 --> 00:10:11.095]  So, I have now been recruiting patients from my practice, people that have come into my office and others that have heard me speak about this and have asked people to do this D-dimer within one week of their COVID shot.
[00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:16.777]  And so far, and this study is ongoing, these are preliminary results, so far I've got 62%
[00:10:18.537 --> 00:10:23.679]  Positive elevated D-dimer, which means that the blood clots are not rare.
[00:10:23.979 --> 00:10:27.201]  That's what the so-called experts keep telling us.
[00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:34.904]  The clots are rare, the big ones are rare, but the small ones are clearly happening in the majority of people, 62%.
[00:10:36.144 --> 00:10:39.466]  Now, I'll tell you what the real concern with this is.
[00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:44.435]  is that a clotted vessel is permanently damaged.
[00:10:44.855 --> 00:10:47.859]  That vessel never, ever goes back to normal.
[00:10:48.709 --> 00:11:06.357]  So, if this theory is correct, which it really looks like by these d-dimer results, and I'm told it has been done in Australia, and it's been done in the UK, and they also found elevated d-dimers, and they sort of discarded the information because they said there's no clinical evidence of clots.
[00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:12.580]  Well, the clinical reading is because they're microscopic, and they're scattered, and so you're not going to see clinical evidence.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:28.063]  But in fact, all of the frequent side effects of the shock, which are headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, could all be signs of cerebral thrombosis on a capillary level.
[00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:40.025]  I mean, those literally, you could be having thousands and thousands of tiny, tiny little clots in your brain that won't show on a scan, but they will give you those exact symptoms.
[00:11:40.794 --> 00:11:49.521]  So the concern is I have now got six people in my medical practice that cannot exert themselves the way they used to be.
[00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:52.543]  What medically we call reduced effort tolerance.
[00:11:53.163 --> 00:12:00.129]  Six people who now get out of breath doing things that they could previously do without any problem.
[00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:09.115]  So I believe that these people locked up thousands and thousands of capillaries in their lungs, in these six people.
[00:12:09.415 --> 00:12:18.122]  So I believe these people now have permanently damaged lungs because they have got, I mean, and that's why they get out of breath.
[00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:24.007]  I have one fellow that used to walk two miles to my office every week for a shot for his arthritis.
[00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:26.549]  And he says, after a quarter of a mile, he's done.
[00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:30.252]  In other words, his effort tolerance is reduced to one eighth of what it used to be.
[00:12:31.737 --> 00:12:36.819]  And so I've sent some of these people for chest x-rays and CT scans to see what it shows.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.421]  And all it shows is distorted architecture.
[00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:46.003]  What the radiologists record is described as increased reticulation.
[00:12:46.043 --> 00:12:47.904]  It's a very nonspecific thing.
[00:12:48.144 --> 00:12:49.785]  And it's because it's microscopic.
[00:12:50.465 --> 00:13:07.792]  It's just, but the concern is because these vessels are now permanently damaged in a person's lungs, when the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels, there's increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs.
[00:13:08.052 --> 00:13:13.875]  So those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery hypertension, high blood pressure in their lungs.
[00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:18.857]  And the concern with that is that those people will probably all develop
[00:13:19.657 --> 00:13:34.723]  Right-sided heart failure within three years and die because they now have increased vascular resistance through their lungs and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue and all of that does not regenerate.
[00:13:34.803 --> 00:13:40.265]  In other tissues it can regenerate, liver and kidneys and muscle and other, but there's some tissues that cannot.
[00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:49.009]  And so this absolutely explains what I've seen in my patients and that's what I'm doing to prove it and my study is ongoing.
[00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:53.128]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is settled science.
[00:13:53.928 --> 00:13:57.091]  Like a shotgun blast to the chest with a 12-gauge will probably kill you.
[00:13:57.592 --> 00:14:00.755]  Or being run over by a truck going 80 miles an hour will probably kill you or at least hurt you.
[00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:12.005]  What these protein crystals are doing, growing in the body, is killing people in mass, is causing brain fog, is causing heart attacks, is causing strokes, is causing the lungs to bleed out like this.
[00:14:12.946 --> 00:14:14.828]  And that's what all the medical literature said it would do.
[00:14:14.868 --> 00:14:15.248]  That's what
[00:14:16.209 --> 00:14:27.519]  All these scientists and doctors warned what happened before it even began, and now they've put advisories on all these major vaccines that they can cause blood clots, that they can cause strokes, they can cause heart attacks.
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.584]  And in much of the world, these so-called vaccines, these experimental shots, are banned.
[00:14:32.744 --> 00:14:33.605]  India's not taking them.
[00:14:33.945 --> 00:14:34.806]  China's not taking them.
[00:14:35.086 --> 00:14:38.069]  Did you know that less than 10% of India is vaccinated right now?
[00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:39.630]  They're refusing to take this.
[00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:40.291]  Now,
[00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:46.080]  Let's talk about the mode of Dr. Lee Merritt of American Frontline Doctors, one of the best organizations out there fighting this tyranny.
[00:14:47.253 --> 00:15:04.219]  Came out in a long report that's on Infowars.com, and she laid out how this is unrestricted warfare by the big banks and the central cartels to destroy the real economy, collapse the third world, and knock out all their competition in the Western world, taking out all the small businesses that, again, they call non-essential.
[00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:15.703]  Once those businesses have collapsed, and after the infrastructure's gone for a few years, then they can give us all universal basic income, but with that will come the strings attached that we've got to
[00:15:16.403 --> 00:15:17.724]  Take the injections they take.
[00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:20.387]  We've got to accept the carbon passports they say they're giving us.
[00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:24.591]  And we have to go under this serious neo-feudalistic control system.
[00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:26.492]  So, that's what this consortium is.
[00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:28.354]  This is a short clip, two minutes long.
[00:15:28.754 --> 00:15:30.696]  The full report, again, is at InfoWars.com.
[00:15:30.736 --> 00:15:32.198]  I suggest you get it and you share it.
[00:15:32.218 --> 00:15:33.839]  This is Dr. Lee Merritt explaining.
[00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:37.843]  This is 21st century, 5th generational, unrestricted warfare.
[00:15:38.612 --> 00:15:41.133]  That's a worrisome sign.
[00:15:42.694 --> 00:15:52.200]  When I say that I think we're going to have to at some point fight back these guys because this isn't just a war that involves medical issues.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:59.624]  This is a multi-dimensional unrestricted war that we're in that involves cyber security and everything.
[00:15:59.904 --> 00:16:02.025]  You know, economic war, cyber security.
[00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:06.686]  I mean, one of the things that's happening, for example, is food is being allowed to rot on docks.
[00:16:07.186 --> 00:16:10.247]  The cost of shipping crates has been jacked up to $20,000.
[00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:12.028]  It used to be $2,000 to $3,000.
[00:16:12.068 --> 00:16:16.869]  The last 15 years, I have a friend in shipping says, two to three years or 15 years, it's been $2,000 to $3,000.
[00:16:17.289 --> 00:16:20.890]  And suddenly overnight, it's $20,000 for one of those shipping crates.
[00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:28.893]  So this is a food squeeze, just like they did to the Kulaks in just like the Bolsheviks did to the Kulaks to get rid of the freedom people in
[00:16:29.773 --> 00:16:32.035]  Russia to bring down and create the Soviet Union.
[00:16:32.535 --> 00:16:33.656]  They couldn't get them any other way.
[00:16:33.696 --> 00:16:36.479]  They starved them and finally disarmed them and killed them.
[00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:47.748]  And I got to tell you, it's looking more worrisome that this is an active... They're weaponizing the medical corps and they've already weaponized public health.
[00:16:47.988 --> 00:16:51.771]  Now they're turning the military against their own people if this happens.
[00:16:52.612 --> 00:16:55.874]  And that's something we have to understand, that we are not out of this.
[00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:58.096]  I think we will win, but we're not out of this yet.
[00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:18.581]  We need to depopulate down to the population we had 500 years ago, which was 500 million, the same number you see at the Georgia Guidestones, put up in the countryside of Georgia, outside Atlanta, by Ted Turner, who's also part of this eugenics cult.
[00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:30.230]  So, mainline science says, if you've had a vaccine that actually works, with real attenuated science, where you get a little bit of the virus or the bacteria, that's either killed or damaged, so it can't hurt you, you learn how to defeat it.
[00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:31.551]  That's not what this is.
[00:17:32.472 --> 00:17:35.374]  Fauci is lying to everyone with bald-faced lies.
[00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:37.215]  Take the PCR test.
[00:17:37.275 --> 00:17:43.940]  They've now officially admit the PCR test is 100% fraud and they're recommending it not be used to quote test for COVID.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.962]  Well, almost 100% were fake positives.
[00:17:47.623 --> 00:17:52.386]  That's why they would count Smythe that died in a car wreck as COVID to again jack those numbers up for fear.
[00:17:52.446 --> 00:17:56.349]  But that's a whole other subject how every piece of this has been a fraud.
[00:17:57.318 --> 00:17:59.719]  Fauci and his cohorts are on every single channel.
[00:17:59.739 --> 00:18:01.840]  Remember, Fauci owns the patents on these vaccines.
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.360]  He ran the Wuhan lab.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.461]  He's part of the eugenics group that wants to have the Great Reset.
[00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:15.665]  So he has all these conflicts of interest, and here he is on every channel saying, if you haven't been vaccinated, you're the reason there's variants, and you're the reason other people are getting sick.
[00:18:16.365 --> 00:18:33.572]  But we're putting on screen for you right now, again, some of the most respected and prestigious scientific institutions in the world saying the opposite, including the discoverer of HIV, Nobel Prize winner, that when you give people a so-called vaccine like this, it makes them create deadly variants of the virus.
[00:18:34.432 --> 00:18:43.824]  In truth, it is Mother Nature taking the COVID virus and turning it into less lethal variants like the Delta, which they now admit has a much smaller sized spike protein on it.
[00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:45.406]  People ask, well, how do you know this, Jones?
[00:18:45.586 --> 00:18:47.068]  I actually read the scientific literature.
[00:18:47.469 --> 00:18:48.911]  Hours a day to understand this.
[00:18:49.271 --> 00:18:51.294]  I've interviewed hundreds of scientists and doctors and...
[00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:58.997]  There's a real consensus on this, but the real consensus of academics and scientists and virologists is all shut off.
[00:18:59.437 --> 00:19:02.977]  And only people like Fauci get a chance to be on national news spewing their lies.
[00:19:03.698 --> 00:19:10.679]  Well, the impact, Jonathan, is that you're going to have the propagation of an outbreak that will continue to smolder.
[00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:15.580]  So you're going to have suffering on the part of the people who are unvaccinated.
[00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:17.141]  There will be some
[00:19:18.422 --> 00:19:24.470]  Not very many, we hope, but there will be some breakthrough infections even among the vaccinated.
[00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:33.884]  So as long as you have circulating virus in the community, which is predominantly because people are not getting vaccinated,
[00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:44.037]  Then they hurt themselves and you don't want to see that because among those are people that are going to wind up getting hospitalized and some of them are going to die.
[00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:49.725]  That's the individual impact on those who don't want to get vaccinated, but there's a broader
[00:19:50.646 --> 00:20:11.293]  Societal impact, Jonathan, in that if you allow the virus to freely circulate because so many people are unvaccinated, you give it yet again another opportunity to mutate even more, and you may wind up with creating a variant that in fact eludes the protection of the vaccine.
[00:20:11.313 --> 00:20:18.916]  We're very fortunate that even though this Delta variant is a real bad actor in the sense of being highly transmissible,
[00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:27.980]  For the most part, the vaccines work very well against it, particularly in protecting you from severe disease leading to hospitalization.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.182]  But you let the virus circulate, you may get a variant that's even worse.
[00:20:32.822 --> 00:20:39.185]  And then when academics try to go online and talk about what's happened, they are censored and they are silenced.
[00:20:39.546 --> 00:20:46.409]  And that's what Professor Martin Koldorf of Harvard Medical School had to say on international TV just a few days ago.
[00:20:47.628 --> 00:20:53.272]  Yes, and I think it already has generated damage because we haven't had an open debate about the pandemic.
[00:20:54.173 --> 00:21:13.067]  And I don't really care if they censor one of my tweets or so personally on my mind, but when you have those censoring and also slander where journalists or scientists slander other scientists, that means that there are many people in the scientific community who do not dare to speak up.
[00:21:14.285 --> 00:21:32.349]  And among the infectious disease epidemiologists that I know personally and that I discuss things personally with, the majority have the same views with me that we need to focus protection or better protecting older high-risk people while letting, for example, schools to be open and that young people live normal lives.
[00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:42.031]  But that's not reflected in the journalism because there are many of my colleagues who do not want to speak up because they've seen what's happened to those who do speak up.
[00:21:43.106 --> 00:21:46.268]  I don't think they should take my credential into account.
[00:21:46.548 --> 00:21:55.494]  I think that people should be able to express their views freely in society, whoever they are.
[00:21:56.454 --> 00:22:04.079]  And there's actually a lot of people who are not scientists who have very insightful thoughts about the pandemic.
[00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:14.206]  One of the principles of public health, many of which have been thrown out the window during this year, but one of the principles of public health is that you have to listen to the public.
[00:22:15.026 --> 00:22:19.350]  They are the ones who are living through the consequences of the lockdowns, for example.
[00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:20.706]  Thank you.
[00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:49.300]  Unlike other aspects of science, like virology or immunology, where you sort of are focused on the lab and the science, in public health, you always have to listen to the public and have an interaction with the public.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.402]  And you have to do it with everybody in the public.
[00:22:51.422 --> 00:22:53.184]  So you have to be open to speak to everybody.
[00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:54.986]  So here's how it works.
[00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:57.689]  The globals cook up the virus that they own and control.
[00:22:58.489 --> 00:22:59.651]  They release it to create fear.
[00:23:00.882 --> 00:23:04.424]  They then say you must take the vaccine to reopen society.
[00:23:05.104 --> 00:23:09.487]  Then they partially reopened society, but they were always planning to bring the lockdowns back.
[00:23:09.567 --> 00:23:19.913]  And now the head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, says only in Republican areas with our strike teams and the weaponized National Institutes of Health will we have new lockdowns in the fall.
[00:23:20.393 --> 00:23:21.833]  In front of you, there is a crystal ball.
[00:23:21.853 --> 00:23:22.834]  What do you see?
[00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.634]  I have to tell you, I personally think that something has gone very wrong in the world.
[00:23:54.694 --> 00:24:00.037]  The whole medical, the bioscientific underpinnings have been broken.
[00:24:00.097 --> 00:24:01.258]  We're off our moorings.
[00:24:01.758 --> 00:24:03.840]  We're not having evidence-based medicine.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.422]  We're not seeing reasonable conclusions being made.
[00:24:07.882 --> 00:24:11.245]  We're not even seeing regulatory decisions being followed.
[00:24:11.745 --> 00:24:17.849]  I mean, I gave you the example of, you know, there are regulatory decisions that say COVID-19 testing is only for sick people.
[00:24:18.629 --> 00:24:21.671]  That's not being followed because people are doing it for asymptomatic people.
[00:24:21.691 --> 00:24:29.076]  You know, the vaccines have been offered as an elective offering and they've been quickly mandated.
[00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:31.498]  So we're seeing things off their underpinnings right now.
[00:24:31.818 --> 00:24:33.980]  There's something going on in the minds of people.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.183]  There's almost a worldwide contagion of a neurosis.
[00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:43.146]  A neurosis is some type of disordered thinking that's spreading from person to person.
[00:24:43.346 --> 00:24:45.788]  That's probably more contagious than the viruses right now.
[00:24:46.243 --> 00:25:12.889]  And this disordered thinking is, I think, rooted in fear, distrust, rooted in anxiety, and it's spreading all over the world, making individuals come up with the most ridiculous decisions like not treating the virus early, forcing unsafe vaccines on one another, having vaccines divide the workplace and schools, dividing families, having people wear masks when they're, you know, driving or jogging or swimming.
[00:25:13.089 --> 00:25:14.829]  This type of stuff makes no sense.
[00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:24.342]  My crystal ball is I think we're in for about a three to five year period of turmoil, and I think it's mental turmoil in human beings.
[00:25:24.402 --> 00:25:33.646]  The types of things I've seen in the minds of people right now is really alarming, and it's most alarming among colleagues in medicine and medical institutions.
[00:25:34.266 --> 00:25:37.787]  The right decisions are not being made right now, and people are being harmed.
[00:25:38.897 --> 00:25:44.321]  As this facade begins to collapse, as the truth begins to really come out, what are they doing?
[00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:45.481]  They're doubling down on their lies.
[00:25:46.122 --> 00:25:49.264]  So now Fauci and all his minions are saying 99% of people dying of COVID.
[00:25:52.278 --> 00:25:53.019]  We're not vaccinated.
[00:25:53.199 --> 00:26:03.428]  But whether you look at Australia, or whether you look at Singapore, or whether you look at the United States, the vast majority of people at the hospital who they say have COVID and who are dying, ladies and gentlemen, guess what?
[00:26:03.729 --> 00:26:06.211]  We're, quote, vaccinated for COVID.
[00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:13.417]  141 people are in hospital with COVID at present, and 43 are in intensive care, 18 of whom require ventilation.
[00:26:13.978 --> 00:26:15.599]  So this is a very serious disease.
[00:26:16.914 --> 00:26:23.358]  Of those 141, 60 are under the age of 55, and 28 under the age of 35.
[00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:39.607]  And of the 43 people in intensive care, one is in their teens, 7 are in their 20s, 3 are in their 30s, 14 are in their 50s, and 12 are in their 60s, and 6 are in their 70s.
[00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:43.690]  So this is affecting people of all ages with very serious disease.
[00:26:45.484 --> 00:26:46.024]  All but one.
[00:26:46.044 --> 00:26:51.386]  A vaccinated one person has just received one dose of vaccine.
[00:26:53.306 --> 00:26:53.866]  All but one.
[00:26:53.886 --> 00:26:59.208]  A vaccinated one person has just received one dose of vaccine.
[00:26:59.228 --> 00:27:03.189]  Piers Morgan got both shots and then almost died.
[00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:04.869]  And they said it was COVID.
[00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:07.910]  And he said, I credited the fact that I barely lived
[00:27:09.042 --> 00:27:10.924]  Because I've taken the so-called vaccines.
[00:27:11.544 --> 00:27:15.367]  You talk about Stockholm Syndrome, when this has happened to so many people.
[00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:37.886]  You can choose to stay unvaccinated if you want, but if you're going to be out in the public and interacting with others, potentially infecting our unvaccinated children, immunocompromised people, and even those who are vaccinated, but still there can be spillover, they can get breakthrough infections, you shouldn't have the right to infect other people with a potentially deadly and extremely contagious disease.
[00:27:38.326 --> 00:27:52.378]  And I think that we should be looking at models like France and Italy where, sure, you can stay unvaccinated if you want, but if you want access to public spaces like restaurants, bars, trains, etc, either you show proof of a negative test or you have to be vaccinated.
[00:27:52.398 --> 00:27:56.122]  I really hope that our public officials start moving in that direction here.
[00:27:56.621 --> 00:28:06.973]  Eric Clapton's instincts told him don't take the deadly shots but his children and family pecked at him and pushed at him and told him it was the right thing to do and he said again it almost killed him.
[00:28:07.414 --> 00:28:11.258]  So he's got the courage to admit what happened to him and he's still very very ill.
[00:28:12.179 --> 00:28:26.668]  The reality is, this is a premeditated plan to see if they can carry out depopulation and eugenics, and to test and see if they can suppress people, and suppress victims, and suppress treatments, so in the future they can launch an attack that's even more severe.
[00:28:27.208 --> 00:28:31.891]  As bad as this has been, this has been Bill Gates' beta test on global depopulation.
[00:28:32.872 --> 00:28:39.196]  That from a vaccine that only carries the spike protein, it's making antibodies to the nuclear capsid.
[00:28:40.558 --> 00:28:44.297]  Which is another part of the virus that's not supposedly in the vaccines.
[00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:48.210]  You can't make antibodies to something not in your body.
[00:28:48.310 --> 00:29:02.577]  So my question is, what's in the vaccines that you're not only making antibodies to the spike protein, but to the nucleocapsid, because their data shows, and that's the key, I think, to this paper, is that there's antibodies to the nucleocapsid.
[00:29:02.997 --> 00:29:09.120]  These vaccines must have more in it than just the spike protein, which we're going to see in a moment.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.721]  And that's not the only paper you should know about, because in 2017,
[00:29:14.782 --> 00:29:31.139]  Moderna published a paper using lipid nanoparticles on the influenza vaccine, and it showed that when the animals tested, their lipid nanoparticle vaccine spread into the brain, the bone marrow, the liver, the spleen, and the muscle site where it was injected.
[00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:31.139]  2017.
[00:29:31.179 --> 00:29:33.081]  Brought to you by Moderna.
[00:29:38.365 --> 00:29:57.968]  It also doesn't explain the fact that if shedding doesn't exist, Health and Human Services and the FDA went to a lot of effort to issue a guidance to the industry in August of 2015 when they issued a document on shedding from viral and bacterial vaccines to the industry and how to test for it.
[00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:03.929]  They didn't spend this type of money and time to test for something that they didn't know and exist.
[00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:05.970]  This is their document.
[00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.430]  It's on the website.
[00:30:09.867 --> 00:30:12.288]  It also doesn't explain one other important thing.
[00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:15.890]  Remember those prion-like diseases we talked about?
[00:30:16.611 --> 00:30:19.972]  Your DNA belongs inside of your nucleus or your mitochondria.
[00:30:20.633 --> 00:30:22.954]  Your RNA belongs inside of your cells.
[00:30:24.095 --> 00:30:27.336]  If your body doesn't see it, it's not a part of your body.
[00:30:27.376 --> 00:30:31.859]  Your immune system doesn't see your genetic code because it's not outside of your cells.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.882]  RNA, outside of your cells, is a prion.
[00:30:40.455 --> 00:30:43.398]  The vaccines contain mRNA.
[00:30:44.459 --> 00:30:49.843]  Any leakage of that material produces a prion-like disease.
[00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:53.287]  So in closing, it's important to understand what is happening right now.
[00:30:53.887 --> 00:30:56.610]  In many areas of the world, the global lockdown never ended.
[00:30:57.662 --> 00:31:00.443]  And now in the United States, they're attempting to bring it back.
[00:31:01.103 --> 00:31:05.684]  And when the United States economy collapses, that causes the third world to literally starve to death.
[00:31:05.984 --> 00:31:12.586]  And the very UN, running the global lockdown, then says, give us more money at UNICEF so we can feed the tens of millions starving to death.
[00:31:13.066 --> 00:31:14.587]  And then of course that aid never gets to them.
[00:31:15.387 --> 00:31:17.888]  This is again all about depopulation.
[00:31:17.928 --> 00:31:33.237]  And the answer is what you're seeing in Paris and what you're seeing in areas of Italy and Europe where the police are joining the protesters and saying no to the ID, no to the medical pass, no to these systems that are designed for total control and are classic authoritarianism.
[00:31:33.997 --> 00:31:35.938]  And the answer is the people standing up
[00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:55.263]  And speaking out and saying no and fighting back politically with truth and information and exposing that the criminals that launched this, that the big pharma organizations and big tech that are suppressing speech have violated the Nuremberg Code and are trying to take over the planet with a corporate tyranny using medical oppression.
[00:31:57.034 --> 00:32:15.485]  Shame on everyone that then joins us, the lawyers, the politicians, the doctors that are scared and decide to go along with it, and the police all over the world with their big Clydesdale horses riding down men, women, and even children in an attempt to intimidate them and say that they're the villains, that they're the bad guys.
[00:32:16.066 --> 00:32:17.167]  When the number is clear,
[00:32:18.086 --> 00:32:19.127]  You heard the doctor earlier.
[00:32:19.767 --> 00:32:23.229]  It's similar to what happened in the animal studies, eerily.
[00:32:23.249 --> 00:32:35.898]  62% of the patients of that major doctor in British Columbia that have had these injections, now in x-rays, have crystals all in their lungs and blood clots all over their body.
[00:32:36.678 --> 00:32:40.441]  62% of the people that are taking these experimental shots
[00:32:41.141 --> 00:32:41.541]  Thank you.
[00:33:01.801 --> 00:33:02.602]  And that's the truth.
[00:33:03.162 --> 00:33:08.587]  So now it's up to you to count the cost, to understand what's happening, and to warn your friends, your families, and your neighbors.
[00:33:09.147 --> 00:33:13.250]  Or, you can decide to go ahead and join this evil takeover, and see how far that gets you.
[00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:20.997]  As for us, we'll keep fighting on at FreeWorldNews.tv, and of course, dreaded by all tyrants, InfoWars.com.
[00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:30.863]  Listen, you've been gracious to come on in your car in a parking lot, there in your minivan.
[00:33:30.883 --> 00:33:32.065]  We really appreciate you.
[00:33:32.405 --> 00:33:33.527]  But I want to talk about something.
[00:33:33.567 --> 00:33:39.414]  Keeping you operating and your thousands of employees, despite all the persecution, keeping InfoWars on air.
[00:33:39.434 --> 00:33:40.315]  Talk about 360 win.
[00:33:40.416 --> 00:33:41.877]  I've already bought your products for years.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:50.541]  Everybody I know loves your products, but you're offering them at the lowest price ever, literally, to our listeners with promo code Alex.
[00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:53.302]  And you've got dog beds, cat beds now.
[00:33:53.342 --> 00:33:57.062]  You've got incredible human beds that are revolutionary at a very low price.
[00:33:57.582 --> 00:34:02.123]  You've got your towels that are the big, that my wife loves, already had them before this.
[00:34:02.563 --> 00:34:06.444]  The pillows, obviously, and the Giza sheets and all of it.
[00:34:06.764 --> 00:34:10.405]  If people go to MyPillow.com and at checkout, put in Alex, you get up to 66%
[00:34:12.785 --> 00:34:15.026]  Off and hey, a lot of you did it.
[00:34:15.126 --> 00:34:17.947]  It got some great support into InfoWars to keep us on air.
[00:34:17.987 --> 00:34:19.527]  MyPillow.com promo code Alex.
[00:34:19.847 --> 00:34:21.408]  MyPillow.com promo code Alex.
[00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:28.690]  Well, it happened last week, right after July 4th.
[00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.391]  World leaders across the planet and the UN announced a new world order.
[00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:36.652]  Global government to stop the spread of COVID.
[00:34:36.832 --> 00:34:40.273]  Oh, and they're going to have to surveil all your text messages on your private phone.
[00:34:40.703 --> 00:34:44.046]  And censor them if you question Fauci and the UN.
[00:34:44.086 --> 00:34:46.789]  That's because these criminals are going to go to prison.
[00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:48.050]  They released the virus.
[00:34:48.491 --> 00:34:50.593]  They have used the whole program to starve the third world.
[00:34:50.913 --> 00:34:59.782]  And they're now bringing in a worldwide ID in Klaus Schwab's own words with an implantable microchip as the next phase to be able to buy and sell or travel.
[00:35:00.343 --> 00:35:02.725]  So whether you believe the Bible or not, the Mark of the Beast is here.
[00:35:02.965 --> 00:35:04.727]  And our mission is now more important than ever.
[00:35:05.007 --> 00:35:06.929]  We make it easy to support InfoWars.
[00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:13.474]  One of our best sellers has been X2 Deep Earth Crystal Iodine that comes in two different packages.
[00:35:13.574 --> 00:35:15.596]  One with a spray bottle, one with a dropper bottle.
[00:35:15.936 --> 00:35:21.141]  It's both the exact same amount of iodine, it's the exact same bottle, it's just a different top.
[00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:30.033]  The spray bottle is selling out, but it's 60% off because I want those of you that have been big supporters to have it again, and I want those of you that have been on the fence to get it for yourself.
[00:35:30.413 --> 00:35:32.536]  And the dropper bottle is really close to selling out.
[00:35:32.956 --> 00:35:35.620]  It is 40% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:36.461]  We also now have...
[00:35:37.242 --> 00:35:37.983]  We're good to go.
